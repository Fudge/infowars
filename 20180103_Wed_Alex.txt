[00:00.000 --> 00:29.980]  Massive anti-government protests are taking place all across Iran.
[00:29.980 --> 00:34.600]  And these protests were sparked Thursday and they've only continued to grow in size.
[00:34.600 --> 00:38.480]  Massive demonstrations against the Islamist regime as a whole, they're chanting.
[00:38.480 --> 00:40.360]  We do not want an Islamic Republic.
[00:40.360 --> 00:43.480]  We do not want an oppressive regime.
[00:43.480 --> 00:45.960]  We do not want mercenary police.
[00:45.960 --> 00:50.560]  There have been reports that protesters have been shot at, several of them killed, but
[00:50.560 --> 00:52.740]  they want the Ayatollah out.
[00:52.740 --> 00:57.840]  But to hear the mainstream media talk about these Iranian protests, you would think that
[00:57.840 --> 01:03.400]  it's just over economic unrest, just a typical labor protest, something we see in Iran.
[01:03.400 --> 01:05.200]  But these are massive demonstrations.
[01:05.200 --> 01:09.720]  They haven't had this many people taken to the streets since 2009 when the people were
[01:09.720 --> 01:13.280]  protesting what they thought was a rigged election.
[01:13.280 --> 01:18.920]  So what we're seeing is CNN's headline, Iranians hold pro-government rallies.
[01:18.920 --> 01:25.040]  After two days of rare anti-government protests, a witness said government supporters rallied
[01:25.040 --> 01:26.360]  in Tehran.
[01:26.360 --> 01:31.320]  So they're not talking to you about the massive numbers of people who are protesting against
[01:31.320 --> 01:35.640]  the government, but they'll tell you about this one little group that a witness said
[01:35.640 --> 01:40.800]  took place where they were pro their oppressive Iranian regime.
[01:40.800 --> 01:42.080]  Why?
[01:42.080 --> 01:45.120]  What in the world is this reporting style?
[01:45.120 --> 01:49.680]  The Washington Post, there was absolutely nothing about the Iranian protests on their
[01:49.680 --> 01:50.680]  front page.
[01:50.680 --> 01:55.240]  CNN was actually called out by Ted Cruz, who said, look, when you guys are being accused
[01:55.240 --> 02:00.200]  of being fake news propaganda, maybe try not to write stories that read like Iranian Pravda.
[02:00.200 --> 02:04.520]  Now, of course, we've got an opinion article up by Stephen L. Miller over at Fox News who's
[02:04.520 --> 02:09.920]  saying, why are the mainstream media outlets so hesitant to report on Iran's protests?
[02:09.920 --> 02:16.760]  And he points out how the New York Times and others, the Washington Post, they talked about
[02:16.760 --> 02:22.160]  these protests and described them simply as economic grievances, which is the same way
[02:22.160 --> 02:25.840]  Iranian state-run television described them as well.
[02:25.840 --> 02:30.520]  So a lot of people are wondering, what's up with the mainstream media coverage of these
[02:30.520 --> 02:31.520]  protests?
[02:31.520 --> 02:36.880]  Are they for an authoritarian police state, Islamofascist dictatorship that subjugates
[02:36.880 --> 02:42.800]  women and tortures and kills its dissidents and issues the death penalty for crimes like
[02:42.800 --> 02:45.520]  homosexuality?
[02:45.520 --> 02:48.960]  It seems like this is something they could get behind, but for whatever reason, they
[02:48.960 --> 02:49.960]  are not.
[02:49.960 --> 02:55.360]  Is it because women in Iran are defying the Islamic religious dress code that was implemented
[02:55.360 --> 03:01.000]  in 1979 that said women had to wear their hijab or they would face arrest?
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.120]  Here we have one woman standing up defying that law, that dress code, and she doesn't
[03:06.120 --> 03:07.120]  have her head covering.
[03:07.120 --> 03:09.840]  She doesn't have her male handler out there with her.
[03:09.840 --> 03:12.800]  She's standing up alone quickly becoming an icon of that protest.
[03:12.800 --> 03:19.120]  You can compare her to the original women's marchers in Iran in 1979 who came out to show
[03:19.120 --> 03:25.840]  that they were also against this Islamic dress code as well when it was originally imposed
[03:25.840 --> 03:28.920]  after the Iranian Revolution in 1979.
[03:28.920 --> 03:35.000]  Are these western media outlets silent because they promoted the women's march and the hijab
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.400]  as a symbol of empowerment?
[03:37.400 --> 03:39.720]  It's so empowering.
[03:39.720 --> 03:40.720]  Remember people were crying.
[03:40.720 --> 03:42.840]  We even have a man wearing a hijab.
[03:42.840 --> 03:45.320]  Oh my God, he's so empowered.
[03:45.320 --> 03:46.480]  People were really upset about this.
[03:46.480 --> 03:50.280]  They said, you know what, women in oppressive countries don't have a choice when it comes
[03:50.280 --> 03:51.360]  to wearing the hijab.
[03:51.360 --> 03:56.440]  So it's kind of a ridiculous that you would use this as a symbol of female empowerment.
[03:56.440 --> 04:01.400]  Is that why the media isn't really covering that angle of the protests or is the media
[04:01.400 --> 04:06.720]  failing to cover these Iranian protests in order to protect the legacy of the Obama-Iran
[04:06.720 --> 04:07.720]  nuclear deal?
[04:07.720 --> 04:12.320]  Let's not forget the establishment media where the main cheerleaders pumping out propaganda
[04:12.320 --> 04:18.360]  about this deal, anyone who even asked questions about it or criticized it at all was immediately
[04:18.360 --> 04:19.360]  attacked.
[04:19.360 --> 04:24.000]  Let's not forget this deal that was so good Obama had to send a plane with $400 million
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.960]  in cash to Iran the day that they made this deal official.
[04:28.960 --> 04:33.240]  And it was also a ransom payment that Iran agreed to release some of our prisoners.
[04:33.240 --> 04:36.000]  Okay, that's a report from Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.360]  You can find the full report on the Alex Jones YouTube channel right there it is.
[04:42.360 --> 04:48.080]  The silence from the liberal media on the Iranian protest, the silence from Linda Sarsour,
[04:48.080 --> 04:52.960]  the silence from the woman's march on the Iranian protest is deafening.
[04:52.960 --> 04:55.000]  We've got stacks and stacks of news on the other side.
[04:55.000 --> 05:21.000]  Roger Stone joins us, don't go anywhere, this is the War Room.
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.120]  I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients but it wasn't
[05:27.120 --> 05:33.520]  prescription but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae and I came up
[05:33.520 --> 05:36.640]  with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers.
[05:36.640 --> 05:43.760]  Non-GMO made right here in America 120 capsules and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglenone
[05:43.760 --> 05:49.160]  to it which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[05:49.160 --> 05:53.640]  hormones in your glands, it is amazing.
[05:53.640 --> 06:16.160]  Red pill now available at m4warstore.com and your purchase fuzz the operation.
[06:16.160 --> 06:41.640]  This is the War Room.
[06:41.640 --> 06:47.920]  Welcome back, I'm Roger Stone and you're in the War Room.
[06:47.920 --> 06:54.960]  This is part of the expanded coverage that Alex Jones has mapped out for the burgeoning
[06:54.960 --> 06:59.320]  Info Wars Information Command Center.
[06:59.320 --> 07:05.440]  We have now opened our bureau in Miami, we've opened our bureau in New York, we've opened
[07:05.440 --> 07:14.880]  our bureau in D.C. and we are bringing you more of the incisive investigative journalism
[07:14.880 --> 07:21.880]  exposing the excesses and crimes of the globalists left and those who would betray the American
[07:21.880 --> 07:22.880]  Dream.
[07:22.880 --> 07:29.520]  They had the presidential election of 2016 completely wired, you see.
[07:29.520 --> 07:36.680]  Hillary Clinton was going to be president and Jeb Bush's job for his cut was to be a
[07:36.680 --> 07:44.360]  graceful loser and if Hillary was so inept that Jeb managed to win, it didn't really
[07:44.360 --> 07:50.240]  matter because all the same people would have jobs and the Bushes will merely cut the Clintons
[07:50.240 --> 07:58.400]  in the way the Clintons have always cut the Bushes in for a piece of their massive theft.
[07:58.400 --> 08:01.760]  They are both crony capitalists.
[08:01.760 --> 08:06.560]  Don't kid yourself, the Clintons are not liberals or progressives.
[08:06.560 --> 08:10.920]  They believe in nothing but the money.
[08:10.920 --> 08:18.200]  The Bushes are not conservatives or libertarians or liberty-oriented, they believe in anything
[08:18.200 --> 08:20.080]  they need to.
[08:20.080 --> 08:28.000]  George H.W. Bush can run as an abortion proponent and then later say he was always pro-life.
[08:28.000 --> 08:36.120]  He can support the entire agenda of the John Birch Society while running for the Senate
[08:36.120 --> 08:44.000]  in 1964 and he can disavow every piece of it running for Congress in 1966.
[08:44.000 --> 08:52.640]  So we have, I think, now turned the corner in terms of their domination of our politics
[08:52.640 --> 09:01.760]  but Donald Trump is a threat to them that they cannot get over and the handling of this
[09:01.760 --> 09:05.000]  Iranian matter is a perfect example.
[09:05.000 --> 09:14.800]  We now know that the advisors to Barack Obama have been criticizing Donald Trump for supporting
[09:14.800 --> 09:21.000]  the uprising by women across the Middle East and in Iran.
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.640]  See, those days are over when you look the other way at the excesses of this crazy ideology
[09:27.640 --> 09:34.760]  that crushes women and gays and Christians or anyone who refuses to see things the way
[09:34.760 --> 09:37.400]  they see them.
[09:37.400 --> 09:47.240]  Donald Trump's posting of a link that showed ISIS slaughtering a handicapped Dutch man
[09:47.240 --> 09:51.440]  is now the formal policy of the United States.
[09:51.440 --> 09:56.200]  We call Islamic terrorism what it is.
[09:56.200 --> 10:04.200]  Let's be clear, none of us here at Info Wars are for excessive foreign expansionism.
[10:04.200 --> 10:11.440]  We don't want more foreign wars that cost billions in which the elites profiteer but
[10:11.440 --> 10:18.000]  our inherent national interest is just nowhere to be found.
[10:18.000 --> 10:24.120]  We at the same time recognize that because of the conduct of foreign policy by the Bushes
[10:24.120 --> 10:30.040]  and the Clintons in which they change sides so frequently and armed both our friends and
[10:30.040 --> 10:36.400]  our foes, leaves Donald Trump with ISIS, a loose end that unfortunately he has no choice
[10:36.400 --> 10:40.520]  as a realist but to clean up.
[10:40.520 --> 10:48.280]  Our fear as I expressed yesterday on the war room is that the generals around him, Kelly,
[10:48.280 --> 10:54.480]  whose own politics are progressive left, Mattis, who admitted before the election that he voted
[10:54.480 --> 11:05.760]  for Hillary and specifically denounced Trump, and of course H.R. McMaster, who has proved
[11:05.760 --> 11:17.440]  his disloyalty in the incident with Sophia Katz, the CEO of Oracle.
[11:17.440 --> 11:24.160]  It was Info Wars that first reported that the national security advisor to the president
[11:24.160 --> 11:32.360]  sat in a dinner with this eminent businesswoman who was widely respected and after too many
[11:32.360 --> 11:38.880]  belts was badmouthing the president of the United States.
[11:38.880 --> 11:43.800]  We reported specifically that McMaster took a cell phone call from the president, stepped
[11:43.800 --> 11:48.880]  away from the table, as would be appropriate, and came back to the table to comment that
[11:48.880 --> 11:51.960]  the president was an idiot.
[11:51.960 --> 11:54.560]  He later called him a moron.
[11:54.560 --> 12:02.160]  He said his ability to understand anything beyond 140 characters is non-existent.
[12:02.160 --> 12:10.720]  As a child, I, I, H.R. McMaster, must save the world from nuclear destruction.
[12:10.720 --> 12:18.200]  Katz was so appalled by this boast and this treachery that she informed her close friend
[12:18.200 --> 12:25.760]  Sheldon Adelson, the philanthropist and gaming magnate from Nevada.
[12:25.760 --> 12:35.560]  And only months later, the mainstream media confirmed the existence of this dinner and
[12:35.560 --> 12:43.360]  the precise conversation that we hear at Info Wars predictive.
[12:43.360 --> 12:48.080]  I have been extraordinarily impressed looking at the new front line of products that have
[12:48.080 --> 12:51.680]  come up at the Info Wars store.
[12:51.680 --> 13:04.240]  You know, I have myself long been an aficionado of both Eastern medicine, herbology, acupuncture,
[13:04.240 --> 13:13.000]  Tai Chi, Chi Kung, a little more exotic form of martial arts.
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.920]  And I recognize that Chinese medicine, Eastern medicine, has only existed for several centuries
[13:19.920 --> 13:30.280]  longer than the take a pill mentality of big pharma and many, not all, but many AMA-trained
[13:30.280 --> 13:32.560]  doctors today.
[13:32.560 --> 13:42.440]  Sadly, there are still millions in the medical establishment who skew what is very clearly
[13:42.440 --> 13:50.040]  therapy and benefits from natural herbs and natural supplements, all of which of course
[13:50.040 --> 13:51.880]  are legal.
[13:51.880 --> 13:54.760]  There are benefits in acupuncture.
[13:54.760 --> 14:01.480]  There are benefits in nutritional products, particularly if one is trying to gain weight
[14:01.480 --> 14:02.880]  and is training hard.
[14:02.880 --> 14:10.200]  And Alex Jones really does an amazing job of fusing the best with some of the oldest
[14:10.200 --> 14:15.360]  and ancient but effective blends, the new alpha-power blend.
[14:15.360 --> 14:18.560]  Look, I've taken a lot of energy tonics.
[14:18.560 --> 14:21.800]  That's what this is called in Chinese medicine.
[14:21.800 --> 14:24.200]  It's heat-based as they say.
[14:24.200 --> 14:28.760]  This just blows me away in terms of my energy level.
[14:28.760 --> 14:37.040]  I get a better run in the morning, I can work later at night, it is really changed my work
[14:37.040 --> 14:38.040]  habits.
[14:38.040 --> 14:45.520]  Right now, you can get it at 34.95, which is a 50% cut.
[14:45.520 --> 14:54.400]  I am now going to look at carnivore, which is a digestive enzyme formula.
[14:54.400 --> 14:56.720]  It's now 33% off.
[14:56.720 --> 15:05.640]  This one is important because while I respect those who skew red meat and who prefer to
[15:05.640 --> 15:13.840]  take their protein as chicken or fish or turkey, and I really cannot get down with the vegans
[15:13.840 --> 15:19.280]  and the vegetarians out there because I think it takes protein to build muscle.
[15:19.280 --> 15:25.600]  At the same time, some red meat in your diet, some, particularly if you're trying to stay
[15:25.600 --> 15:33.160]  in shape and you're exercising regularly, I think is required, carnivore is similar
[15:33.160 --> 15:38.720]  to a product that I've taken before, although my son has taken it and he says it's much
[15:38.720 --> 15:39.720]  better.
[15:39.720 --> 15:40.720]  I've just ordered it.
[15:40.720 --> 15:48.480]  It helps you digest in your gut and break down the enzymes commonly found in red meat.
[15:48.480 --> 15:54.360]  It really is enticing, I've got it, I'm going to try it.
[15:54.360 --> 15:59.680]  My son is yet another satisfied customer.
[15:59.680 --> 16:03.680]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[16:03.680 --> 16:09.040]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war, a 360 win.
[16:09.040 --> 16:14.000]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[16:14.000 --> 16:15.600]  at infowarsore.com.

[16:19.440 --> 16:23.520]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[16:23.520 --> 16:28.760]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[16:28.760 --> 16:32.880]  Customers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[16:32.880 --> 16:34.640]  the products that you need each month.
[16:34.640 --> 16:39.240]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and
[16:39.240 --> 16:42.360]  choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[16:42.360 --> 16:47.480]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com
[16:47.480 --> 16:49.040]  this is a sure win.
[16:49.040 --> 16:55.040]  10% off on auto ship, win win win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[16:55.040 --> 16:59.280]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[16:59.280 --> 17:05.760]  Climb to the top of the food chain with alpha power by infowarslife for those who want to
[17:05.760 --> 17:09.360]  increase testosterone and energy levels.
[17:09.360 --> 17:14.720]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of
[17:14.720 --> 17:17.280]  about 1 to 2% per year.
[17:17.280 --> 17:24.520]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[17:24.520 --> 17:29.000]  Alpha power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on
[17:29.000 --> 17:30.000]  the market.
[17:30.000 --> 17:36.520]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated
[17:36.520 --> 17:43.440]  into their most potent forms including uricoma longifolia originally from Malaysia, makaroo
[17:43.440 --> 17:49.480]  from Peru, horny goatweed from China and tribulus from India.
[17:49.480 --> 17:53.440]  Reach your alpha male potential with alpha power.
[17:53.440 --> 18:00.000]  Alpha power now at 50% off and secure your bottle today.
[18:00.000 --> 18:04.640]  Feel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by infowarslife.
[18:04.640 --> 18:08.600]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of
[18:08.600 --> 18:11.920]  nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[18:11.920 --> 18:16.200]  They also help prevent discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[18:16.200 --> 18:18.040]  particles in the gut.
[18:18.040 --> 18:20.480]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[18:20.480 --> 18:24.440]  Power is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[18:24.440 --> 18:27.600]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[18:27.600 --> 18:32.160]  You can eat protein heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[18:32.160 --> 18:34.960]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[18:34.960 --> 18:39.160]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption

[20:27.200 --> 20:48.400]  Welcome back, I'm Roger Stone and you're in the war room with your host Roger Stone broadcasting
[20:48.400 --> 20:54.320]  now from an undisclosed location in sunny South Florida and my colleague Owen Schreuer
[20:54.320 --> 21:02.480]  in our state of the art and ever expanding info wars studio in Austin.
[21:02.480 --> 21:08.920]  When you visit Austin, I must tell you it's exhilarating because there's a great spirit
[21:08.920 --> 21:17.440]  on the info wars staff, not only the on air talent but all of the great writers and technicians
[21:17.440 --> 21:24.200]  and IT people and there's always kind of a small coterie of activists hanging around.
[21:24.200 --> 21:27.960]  The energy is really significant.
[21:27.960 --> 21:31.120]  We realize the forces of freedom are on the move.
[21:31.120 --> 21:39.280]  We realize that info wars is a key asset in the fight for truth and the shot of our taking
[21:39.280 --> 21:48.520]  back our country is only possible because of a free alternative media in which info wars
[21:48.520 --> 21:51.520]  is one if not the leader.
[21:51.520 --> 21:55.120]  This is why Google seeks to snuff us.
[21:55.120 --> 21:58.840]  This is why Twitter seeks to silence us.
[21:58.840 --> 22:04.280]  This is a why they want to put the toothpaste back in the tube.
[22:04.280 --> 22:11.360]  This is why they're using the laws set by the Congress to guarantee no pornography and
[22:11.360 --> 22:17.480]  decency on the needy are being used to suppress political speech.
[22:17.480 --> 22:24.480]  This is why it's important as I say that you hit the info wars store because we are the
[22:24.480 --> 22:30.320]  spirit of the revolution and Trump can only be protected and the revolution continued
[22:30.320 --> 22:37.760]  if we are out there to defend them and expose the hypocrisy of the jackals at the hyenas
[22:37.760 --> 22:41.440]  who are nipping at the heels of a giant.
[22:41.440 --> 22:50.640]  I do want to say that I saw over the holiday break an extraordinary new book by the reporter
[22:50.640 --> 22:59.760]  Edward Klein, entitled All Out War, which is his outline of the extraordinary effort
[22:59.760 --> 23:02.120]  to take down the president.
[23:02.120 --> 23:09.520]  Now, Ed Klein is not somebody whose writing should be taken lightly.
[23:09.520 --> 23:17.120]  He has gone from being a copy boy for the New York Daily News, becoming a reporter for
[23:17.120 --> 23:19.480]  the World Telegram and Sun.
[23:19.480 --> 23:26.180]  He's a Columbia graduate, but more importantly, he worked with Distinguished Service as a
[23:26.180 --> 23:31.440]  managing editor for Newsweek, also joined the New York Times, editor-in-chief of the
[23:31.440 --> 23:39.200]  New York Times Magazine, then led this flagship publication for a number of years, then at
[23:39.200 --> 23:45.720]  Time Magazine, winning a Pulitzer Prize, Ed Klein is written for Vanity Fair and so
[23:45.720 --> 23:46.720]  on.
[23:46.720 --> 23:54.720]  He's an extraordinary author, but his books specifically on the Obamas, on the Clintons,
[23:54.720 --> 24:02.360]  is some of the very best, completely unbiased investigative journalism out there today.
[24:02.360 --> 24:07.880]  And his new book, All Out War, is about the attempt to take Donald Trump down.
[24:07.880 --> 24:14.720]  And leafing through this terrific book, which I commend to you, I found this passage, which
[24:14.720 --> 24:26.160]  confirms, based on Ed Klein's research, that the Justice Department under Barack Obama
[24:26.160 --> 24:32.880]  went into the FISA court were extraordinarily confident that they could trick a judge into
[24:32.880 --> 24:42.320]  allowing them to spy on four individuals, those being General Flynn, Paul Manafort,
[24:42.320 --> 24:49.120]  the harmless, but I think decent, Carter Page, and myself.
[24:49.120 --> 24:59.440]  And they were stunned when the FISA court judge declined their authority to push such
[24:59.440 --> 25:02.040]  a surveillance.
[25:02.040 --> 25:08.200]  Later in Klein's incredible book, he tells about how they take the exact same request,
[25:08.200 --> 25:15.240]  including yours truly, and they resubmit it to a judge and trick that judge into approval.
[25:15.240 --> 25:22.200]  Thus begins the surveillance of the Trump campaign by the Deep State.
[25:22.200 --> 25:27.480]  This information is, of course, then used in the unmaskings.
[25:27.480 --> 25:34.160]  In some ways, I must say I feel like the forest gump of American politics, whether it was
[25:34.160 --> 25:44.640]  the Bush-Gore recount, or whether it was the Trump campaign, or even as a wrongly accused
[25:44.640 --> 25:55.760]  witness in the farce that is the Russian collusion delusion, I have enjoyed a role in every major
[25:55.760 --> 25:59.520]  presidential campaign, albeit one.
[25:59.520 --> 26:08.680]  I was not involved in George Bush's reelection campaign, and I specifically told Lee Atwater,
[26:08.680 --> 26:15.560]  a colleague of some time, about the folly of the Willie Horton ad.
[26:15.560 --> 26:19.200]  I was a critic of that ad.
[26:19.200 --> 26:21.480]  It wasn't that I thought it might not work.
[26:21.480 --> 26:27.840]  I knew it probably would, but it would be a stain that the Bushes would wear forever.
[26:27.840 --> 26:32.080]  And so, sadly, did my friend Lee Atwater.
[26:32.080 --> 26:41.920]  I have memorialized this in several articles in my books that I had no role in the campaign
[26:41.920 --> 26:43.880]  of 1992.
[26:43.880 --> 26:53.640]  So in this particular case, I have found few reporters who have the sources of an incline.
[26:53.640 --> 27:01.600]  I really strongly recommend Klein's book to you if you want to see the precursor to
[27:01.600 --> 27:08.520]  what I believe is the A, B, and C plan.
[27:08.520 --> 27:14.520]  As I reported yesterday on the war room, the fact that Rex Tillerson is now staying after
[27:14.520 --> 27:22.320]  a private lunch with the president, including General McMaster, General Mattis, and General
[27:22.320 --> 27:29.720]  Kelly, that is because, in my opinion, they need Tillerson's vote for the coming 11th
[27:29.720 --> 27:34.840]  Amendment takedown, 25th Amendment takedown, pardon me.
[27:34.840 --> 27:37.760]  We will talk about this on the other side.
[27:37.760 --> 27:43.200]  You're on the war room with Roger Stone, and we're going to bring back my colleague Owen
[27:43.200 --> 27:45.280]  Schreuer and kick it around.
[27:45.280 --> 27:52.200]  We'll be right back.
[27:52.200 --> 27:53.200]  And there it is.
[27:53.200 --> 27:54.200]  All right.
[27:54.200 --> 27:59.680]  Well, actually, we've got about 60 seconds left in this segment here, Roger.
[27:59.680 --> 28:03.360]  So I know that we're going to get into the Tillerson updates and everything else.
[28:03.360 --> 28:04.360]  I apologize.
[28:04.360 --> 28:07.360]  I lost my clock there for a second.
[28:07.360 --> 28:12.440]  It's interesting, though, because yesterday, and I'm sure we'll talk about this too sometime
[28:12.440 --> 28:17.160]  before we get off here, yesterday, President Trump tweets out top Hillary Clinton aide
[28:17.160 --> 28:23.400]  Huma Abedin guilty of X and X, the same man that was found guilty of that wound up in
[28:23.400 --> 28:25.640]  jail, doesn't she belong in jail.
[28:25.640 --> 28:31.920]  And then here we are 24 hours later, and there is a fire at Bill and Hillary Clinton's house.
[28:31.920 --> 28:37.600]  I mean, it's not like Hillary Clinton has a history of deleting emails or, you know,
[28:37.600 --> 28:41.240]  the Democrats smashing servers or not turning over servers.
[28:41.240 --> 28:44.120]  So I'm sure there's nothing to this story.
[28:44.120 --> 28:47.360]  You know, Hillary and Bill Clinton have never done anything they want to try to hide.
[28:47.360 --> 28:49.720]  So I'm sure that there's just nothing to this.
[28:49.720 --> 28:52.960]  It was just a house fire at Bill and Hillary's house, and they're not trying to hide any
[28:52.960 --> 28:55.360]  evidence of any of any wrongdoing that they've ever done.
[28:55.360 --> 28:56.360]  No way.
[28:56.360 --> 29:04.880]  Introducing Floor Life, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWarsLife.
[29:04.880 --> 29:09.840]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[29:09.840 --> 29:14.240]  Floor Life probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[29:14.240 --> 29:18.360]  and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[29:18.360 --> 29:22.840]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted
[29:22.840 --> 29:27.200]  delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[29:27.200 --> 29:31.880]  Floor Life supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity,
[29:31.880 --> 29:34.360]  immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[29:34.360 --> 29:38.440]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[29:38.440 --> 29:39.440]  That's why.
[29:39.440 --> 29:43.080]  Your immune gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[29:43.080 --> 29:47.720]  Floor Life is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care, and a 50 billion
[29:47.720 --> 29:51.080]  probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.

[31:28.400 --> 31:29.720]  and Biblical times.
[31:29.720 --> 31:34.800]  Instead of containing fluoride, our super-blue line is floated with the good halogen iodine
[31:34.800 --> 31:39.040]  and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral
[31:39.040 --> 31:40.040]  health benefits.
[31:40.040 --> 31:45.360]  Super-blue, fluoride-free mouthwash and toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these
[31:45.360 --> 31:49.720]  natural ingredients, xylitol, nano-silver, and iodine.

[32:28.160 --> 32:29.160]  meals.
[32:29.160 --> 32:30.160]  Woo!
[32:30.160 --> 32:31.160]  That's what I'm talking about.
[32:31.160 --> 32:35.600]  When compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,

[33:11.200 --> 33:30.080]  This is the return of the Republic and this is the War Room with Roger Stone.
[33:30.080 --> 33:34.400]  Watch the live stream right now at infowars.com.
[33:34.400 --> 34:02.000]  All right, you're back in the War Room with your correspondents, Roger Stone and in the
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.680]  Austin Power Center, Owen Schreuer.
[34:05.680 --> 34:12.560]  I'm glad you raised the issue of Huma Abedin and her emails.
[34:12.560 --> 34:17.680]  Let me try to break down for our audience what has really transpired here.
[34:17.680 --> 34:24.840]  The emails that were released by the State Department, which were emails that Huma Abedin
[34:24.840 --> 34:32.880]  forwarded to a server that was under the control of both she and her husband, the currently
[34:32.880 --> 34:45.160]  incarcerated Congressman Anthony Wiener, were but a small portion of the entire trove of
[34:45.160 --> 34:46.160]  emails.
[34:46.160 --> 34:54.200]  Interestingly enough, what the State Department released was evidence that Huma regularly
[34:54.200 --> 35:01.400]  forwarded classified documents illegally to a server she shared with her husband.
[35:01.400 --> 35:10.480]  In other words, this data dump was tailored as the evidence for the conviction of a crime,
[35:10.480 --> 35:18.960]  a specific crime, the misuse of classified documents, what Hillary should be charged
[35:18.960 --> 35:19.960]  with.
[35:19.960 --> 35:23.040]  Now, why would the State Department do this?
[35:23.040 --> 35:29.320]  Well, to be seen in the larger light of the executive order put out last week, giving
[35:29.320 --> 35:34.800]  the President broad powers to go after those who've been involved in public corruption
[35:34.800 --> 35:43.400]  or pedophilia or corporate theft or any other crime against the country, this is a chilling
[35:43.400 --> 35:47.800]  indictment that the perp walk is coming for Huma.
[35:47.800 --> 35:52.160]  Now, how do I know that this is just a portion?
[35:52.160 --> 36:00.200]  We reported here at InfoWars during the final days of the election that the trove of emails
[36:00.200 --> 36:10.320]  in question was discovered not by the FBI, but by the New York Police Department.
[36:10.320 --> 36:18.680]  And that the Police Department had forwarded these emails discovered in their conduct of
[36:18.680 --> 36:31.800]  a underage texting scandal involving Wiener, who would ultimately, of course, be charged,
[36:31.800 --> 36:40.760]  convicted and sent to prison, and that the documents were supplied by NYPD to the FBI.
[36:40.760 --> 36:49.920]  My sources tell me that there's far, far more here than the classified State Department
[36:49.920 --> 36:50.920]  documents.
[36:50.920 --> 36:57.120]  There's money laundering, there's corruption, there's pedophilia, there's child exploitation,
[36:57.120 --> 37:03.520]  there's a great deal of material regarding the Haiti and the theft of the Haitian earthquake
[37:03.520 --> 37:05.560]  funds.
[37:05.560 --> 37:14.840]  One detective told me point blank, this is Huma's blackmail file, and I said, you mean
[37:14.840 --> 37:17.960]  she might blackmail Hillary and Bill?
[37:17.960 --> 37:23.760]  He said no, but if they ever choose to try to dump her, this is how she will stay on
[37:23.760 --> 37:24.960]  the payroll.
[37:24.960 --> 37:30.560]  She will stay in the first circle, extraordinary, really extraordinary.
[37:30.560 --> 37:36.640]  Well, and last night you had this report coming from John Solomon at the Hill, who's been
[37:36.640 --> 37:43.520]  doing great work, especially when it comes to the Uranium One scandal and the, well,
[37:43.520 --> 37:48.720]  what was really a lack of a fair investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails, John Solomon
[37:48.720 --> 37:53.560]  writes this for the Hill last night, it gets published, congressional investigators find
[37:53.560 --> 37:58.360]  irregularities in FBI's handling of Clinton email case.
[37:58.360 --> 38:04.560]  Now of course, yesterday morning, President Trump sends the tweet out as you're referring
[38:04.560 --> 38:10.760]  to Huma Abedin with what was found in her emails and the classified information that
[38:10.760 --> 38:17.000]  also made its way to pervert Wieners servers as well, and how in other similar instances
[38:17.000 --> 38:24.080]  the perpetrator has been put in jail, that in this case would be Huma Abedin.
[38:24.080 --> 38:32.720]  And then today, you have a fire at Bill and Hillary's Chappaqua, New York compound.
[38:32.720 --> 38:40.840]  So I mean, are we reaching here, or is there a connection between all of these events,
[38:40.840 --> 38:41.840]  Roger?
[38:41.840 --> 38:45.920]  Well, there's an intermediate step that's very important here, and you can read about
[38:45.920 --> 38:49.680]  it in Hillary's fictional book, What Happened?
[38:49.680 --> 38:50.680]  What happened?
[38:50.680 --> 38:51.680]  Let me tell you what happened.
[38:51.680 --> 39:00.400]  People figured out that you were a mean-spirited, vile, privileged, nasty, short-tempered, foul-mouthed,
[39:00.400 --> 39:09.760]  and epically greedy autocrat, and they saw through your lifetime of crime and corruption,
[39:09.760 --> 39:12.920]  and they turned to a true American patriot.
[39:12.920 --> 39:22.560]  But she tells us in her book, you know, all about what has transpired, remember, whatever
[39:22.560 --> 39:30.960]  is in the NYPD discovered emails is so shocking to Mr. Comey that he announces on the Friday
[39:30.960 --> 39:36.400]  before the election that he's reopening the investigation into her email case.
[39:36.400 --> 39:43.240]  Then he wants us to believe by Sunday evening that a bureau that took three years to read
[39:43.240 --> 39:55.640]  330,000 documents read 750,000 documents in two days, using presumably very broad keyword
[39:55.640 --> 39:59.760]  search engines, bogus in my view.
[39:59.760 --> 40:05.920]  The people I saw and spoke with at NYPD as info or sources had seen the actual emails
[40:05.920 --> 40:13.960]  and they described them as lewd, nasty, stunning, brazen, and so on.
[40:13.960 --> 40:17.960]  So we know that they had to cover this up.
[40:17.960 --> 40:21.960]  Then Comey has us believe that there's nothing there of value.
[40:21.960 --> 40:26.040]  Now they release a small number.
[40:26.040 --> 40:31.560]  If this is what Comey saw, he would not have reopened the investigation.
[40:31.560 --> 40:39.480]  This is a treasure trove that would pave the way to prison for both Clintons if they have
[40:39.480 --> 40:42.560]  not already done so.
[40:42.560 --> 40:49.640]  And just to put things in perspective here for the, let's just say the Trump detractors.
[40:49.640 --> 40:56.400]  If Donald Trump refused to turn over information in the Russian investigation probe, as the
[40:56.400 --> 41:03.680]  DNC did, the DNC and CrowdStrike are yet to turn over their servers so that they can show
[41:03.680 --> 41:07.760]  who indeed hacked them, whether or not it was the Russians.
[41:07.760 --> 41:14.400]  And then two, if you look at all of the emails and the deleting of the emails and everything
[41:14.400 --> 41:19.520]  that took place within the Clinton campaign, that for sure would be considered obstruction
[41:19.520 --> 41:22.400]  of justice if it was Donald Trump doing it.
[41:22.400 --> 41:27.080]  However, he's not the one that did it, he's not the one that deleted the emails, he's
[41:27.080 --> 41:31.400]  not the one that's not cooperating with any investigation and making false claims, yet
[41:31.400 --> 41:34.680]  he is still the target of this investigation.
[41:34.680 --> 41:39.440]  Which is why when you say what about the fire, one has to say absolutely, if there were a
[41:39.440 --> 41:45.520]  fire in a Trump golf course, they'd say he was destroying evidence of Russian collusion.
[41:45.520 --> 41:48.560]  The Clintons would steal a hot stove.
[41:48.560 --> 41:50.520]  How do we know that they would destroy evidence?
[41:50.520 --> 41:57.240]  They have already done so in a crime spree that goes back almost 40 years.
[41:57.240 --> 42:05.480]  So yes, the fire in their home in Posh, Tony Chappaqua has to be viewed very suspiciously.
[42:05.480 --> 42:11.880]  Now, is it possible that Bill was in a bedroom smoking pot with one of the maids entirely
[42:11.880 --> 42:12.880]  possible?
[42:12.880 --> 42:14.280]  It could have been a cigar, all right?
[42:14.280 --> 42:17.120]  It could have been a cigar.
[42:17.120 --> 42:22.120]  But as he told a famous reporter, cocaine, what does that look like?
[42:22.120 --> 42:27.400]  Which is funny because Roger Clinton quoted in my book, the Clintons warned women saying
[42:27.400 --> 42:31.080]  that his brother snorted cocaine like a vacuum.
[42:31.080 --> 42:33.920]  I've never heard of cocaine.
[42:33.920 --> 42:38.080]  It's not like people that do a bunch of cocaine's voice ends up sounding like this, that never
[42:38.080 --> 42:39.080]  happens ever.
[42:39.080 --> 42:41.160]  So I don't know what you're talking about.
[42:41.160 --> 42:45.240]  That was just a small fire we had today, it was an oven we were trying to steal from
[42:45.240 --> 42:46.240]  the White House.
[42:46.240 --> 42:47.240]  It was still on.
[42:47.240 --> 42:48.840]  We didn't know it was on though, Roger.
[42:48.840 --> 42:53.240]  Well, I would say this, you're no cringy, cringy, critical, but not bad.
[42:53.240 --> 42:56.880]  Very no inshore, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:56.880 --> 42:57.880]  I'll take it.
[42:57.880 --> 42:59.440]  Thank you, Roger.
[42:59.440 --> 43:02.760]  Introducing Cell Force by Infowars Life.
[43:02.760 --> 43:07.280]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[43:07.280 --> 43:10.040]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[43:10.040 --> 43:12.640]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[43:12.640 --> 43:17.400]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[43:17.400 --> 43:19.880]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[43:19.880 --> 43:24.360]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[43:24.360 --> 43:26.800]  reactive oxygen species.
[43:26.800 --> 43:31.980]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[43:31.980 --> 43:34.880]  these reactive oxygen species.
[43:34.880 --> 43:39.920]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[43:39.920 --> 43:44.760]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[43:44.760 --> 43:47.280]  species and other free radicals.
[43:47.280 --> 43:52.560]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from Infowars Life.

[44:00.120 --> 44:01.840]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air.
[44:01.840 --> 44:02.840]  Another Matt, go ahead.
[44:02.840 --> 44:07.400]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of Infowars
[44:07.400 --> 44:11.920]  and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely
[44:11.920 --> 44:17.080]  fantastic and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the Infowars.
[44:17.080 --> 44:22.760]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up
[44:22.760 --> 44:24.760]  right now are absolutely amazing.
[44:24.760 --> 44:25.760]  Well thank you.
[44:25.760 --> 44:30.760]  My favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but it says won't tread on me and it's
[44:30.760 --> 44:35.400]  a big day glow snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, infowars.com
[44:35.400 --> 44:36.400]  on the right arm.
[44:36.400 --> 44:41.880]  I mean that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise
[44:41.880 --> 44:42.880]  free speech.
[44:42.880 --> 44:48.400]  And the newest one is trigger warning t-shirt, trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol
[44:48.400 --> 44:52.880]  of a trigger with a yield sign in the infowars.com on the back.
[44:52.880 --> 44:59.880]  That is the new shirt of the month available exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.

[45:31.240 --> 45:34.320]  every cell, tissue, and organ in the body.
[45:34.320 --> 45:39.000]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight

[46:57.840 --> 47:15.840]  The War Room, Infowars.com, Forge Slash Show.
[47:15.840 --> 47:25.520]  Welcome back.
[47:25.520 --> 47:27.840]  You are in the right place.
[47:27.840 --> 47:30.600]  This is Freedom Command Central.
[47:30.600 --> 47:37.040]  It's the War Room with Roger Stone and Owen Shroyer, part of the expanded coverage that
[47:37.040 --> 47:41.160]  Alex Jones has mapped out for 2018.
[47:41.160 --> 47:46.120]  You know, I know that you, like me, are very proud of the fact that we here at Infowars
[47:46.120 --> 47:48.000]  break a lot of news.
[47:48.000 --> 47:54.280]  We have been consistently ahead of the mainstream media.
[47:54.280 --> 48:00.440]  Two stories that illustrate that extremely well is the news yesterday that veteran conservative
[48:00.440 --> 48:08.720]  Senator Orrin Hatch would step down in Utah and former Michigan, pardon me, former Massachusetts
[48:08.720 --> 48:16.040]  governor Mitt Romney, the failed 26th Republican presidential candidate, would launch a candidacy
[48:16.040 --> 48:18.360]  for that seat.
[48:18.360 --> 48:23.920]  The New York Times and The Washington Post reported this as if it was a breathtaking
[48:23.920 --> 48:30.320]  revelation when we hadn't reported Romney's preparation and, in fact, at this moment,
[48:30.320 --> 48:37.560]  he appears to be unchallenged in a Republican primary for that seat.
[48:37.560 --> 48:42.440]  That grudge put it up, only reporting the news as it is.
[48:42.440 --> 48:50.480]  So once again, Infowars gave you the straight story weeks earlier than the mainstream media.
[48:50.480 --> 49:00.360]  Also interesting was a story in the Hill regarding, pardon me, the reversal of the president's
[49:00.360 --> 49:03.720]  position on troops to Afghanistan.
[49:03.720 --> 49:11.320]  We at Infowars are reported exclusively to you only weeks ago that National Security
[49:11.320 --> 49:18.840]  Advisor H.R. McMaster was attempting to get the president to sign documents authorizing
[49:18.840 --> 49:23.720]  a 50,000 troop allotment to Afghanistan.
[49:23.720 --> 49:29.480]  Remember, we were told we were going to have a continuing presence and that General Mattis
[49:29.480 --> 49:35.520]  would have discretion on the number of troops, but it was implied that it would be around
[49:35.520 --> 49:36.520]  9,000.
[49:36.520 --> 49:46.040]  50,000 is the largest single deployment we have had to this doomed enterprise.
[49:46.040 --> 49:52.720]  Candidate Donald Trump knew and said that Afghanistan was a loser, a pit for American
[49:52.720 --> 50:01.920]  lives and money, but success there was unachievable as the Russians and the Brits both learned.
[50:01.920 --> 50:09.160]  Ronald Reagan skillfully maneuvered the Russians into backing their paw into this mess and
[50:09.160 --> 50:12.720]  it helped cost them the Cold War.
[50:12.720 --> 50:19.720]  Then we skillfully, as Americans turned around and stepped in the very trap that we had laid
[50:19.720 --> 50:22.000]  for the Russians.
[50:22.000 --> 50:27.320]  Thank you, George Bush and your successors.
[50:27.320 --> 50:34.760]  This reversal, again, first reported at Infowars, but confirming the largest troop allotments
[50:34.760 --> 50:44.080]  yet and a ramping up, not a phasing down of our military presence.
[50:44.080 --> 50:48.640]  Once again, at Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[50:48.640 --> 50:55.720]  Well, you've done a good job keeping track of all those stories too, Roger, that we break
[50:55.720 --> 51:00.640]  and then we almost forget that we broke it a month ago or months ago and then when the
[51:00.640 --> 51:04.160]  mainstream media picks up on it, we kind of realize, oh yeah, we were talking about
[51:04.160 --> 51:12.440]  that a few months back and this whole Russian collusion stuff is kind of a perfect overall
[51:12.440 --> 51:18.320]  example where as soon as we saw this narrative coming down the pipeline, Roger, we already
[51:18.320 --> 51:19.880]  knew where it came from.
[51:19.880 --> 51:23.680]  We knew where to identify the Russian dossier, Trump dossier.
[51:23.680 --> 51:24.980]  We knew how to identify that.
[51:24.980 --> 51:27.200]  That's clearly a dirty Democrat technique.
[51:27.200 --> 51:30.200]  That's clearly a Clinton fingerprint written all over it.
[51:30.200 --> 51:32.320]  We saw the tea leaves from the beginning.
[51:32.320 --> 51:37.760]  That's why, you know, really, oh, like, and I'm not insulting John Solomon, the guy does
[51:37.760 --> 51:38.760]  great work.
[51:38.760 --> 51:43.680]  It's just when we see this headline, congressional investigators find irregularities in FBI's
[51:43.680 --> 51:45.280]  handling of Clinton email case.
[51:45.280 --> 51:49.080]  It's like, well, duh, like, duh, really?
[51:49.080 --> 51:50.480]  We've been telling you that since day one.
[51:50.480 --> 51:55.320]  How about Peter Stroke, the same guy that let Hillary Clinton and Sheryl Mills go is
[51:55.320 --> 51:58.280]  saying he wants an insurance plan for the president?
[51:58.280 --> 52:00.120]  Well, let me say this.
[52:00.120 --> 52:07.720]  I think John Solomon is literally one of the very best incisive and aggressive investigative
[52:07.720 --> 52:09.280]  journalists out there.
[52:09.280 --> 52:15.520]  It was John Solomon who then was at Circa News who broke the extraordinary case that
[52:15.520 --> 52:23.840]  the Clinton, pardon me, that the Obama NSA had illegally surveilled almost 39,000 Americans
[52:23.840 --> 52:30.800]  essentially for political purposes in an act of political espionage paid for by the taxpayers.
[52:30.800 --> 52:35.360]  That relates to the FISA warrant we talked about in the last segment.
[52:35.360 --> 52:40.200]  The fact that I was among those that were being surveilled.
[52:40.200 --> 52:43.320]  So Solomon has broken some huge stories.
[52:43.320 --> 52:53.080]  He and Sarah Carter are among the two investigative journalists that I respect the most.
[52:53.080 --> 53:00.120]  In this story, I think what Solomon has done is to nail down what we first reported on,
[53:00.120 --> 53:05.120]  but which he has filled in many blanks and provided a great deal of documentation.
[53:05.120 --> 53:07.600]  He did not have at the time.
[53:07.600 --> 53:15.680]  So thank God for the Hill, it is neither a conservative or liberal news site.
[53:15.680 --> 53:18.760]  They seem to me to be fact-based, Owen.
[53:18.760 --> 53:23.800]  Yeah, everything that John Solomon has been reporting on ends up coming true.
[53:23.800 --> 53:24.800]  Same with Sarah Carter.
[53:24.800 --> 53:28.120]  Again, they were both at Circa News, John Solomon, now with the Hill.
[53:28.120 --> 53:32.000]  Another reporter that's been doing great work, Chuck Ross for The Daily Caller.
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.800]  He puts out this piece today.
[53:34.800 --> 53:38.880]  Fit panel hits back at Fusion GPS over op-ed claims.
[53:38.880 --> 53:44.680]  Spokesman for Chuck Grassley says that Fusion GPS asked during August 22nd, I guess it was
[53:44.680 --> 53:51.400]  a hearing, for the transcript to be kept confidential and then Glenn Simpson of Fusion
[53:51.400 --> 53:55.080]  GPS declined an invitation for an open hearing.
[53:55.080 --> 54:02.800]  So this is Fusion GPS now, Roger, that is realizing that the heat is on them and they're trying
[54:02.800 --> 54:06.840]  to avoid any toxicity of this whole thing as well.
[54:06.840 --> 54:09.320]  Well, it is extraordinary.
[54:09.320 --> 54:10.320]  The worm is turning.
[54:10.320 --> 54:16.640]  We also have stunning news of my old partner and boyhood friend, Paul Manafort's lawsuit
[54:16.640 --> 54:28.680]  against the bogus conduct of an investigation by Robert Mueller and the FBI, in this case,
[54:28.680 --> 54:29.680]  DOJ.
[54:29.680 --> 54:37.360]  Manafort and his lawyers have been keeping thread, as they say, for many, many months.
[54:37.360 --> 54:41.520]  Manafort's civil liberties have been systematically violated.
[54:41.520 --> 54:44.160]  His due process has been violated.
[54:44.160 --> 54:51.680]  The thug tactics of Mueller's bully boy hit squad have violated his constitutional rights.
[54:51.680 --> 54:59.520]  And I always believe there was a lawsuit or series of devastating lawsuits coming.
[54:59.520 --> 55:06.040]  Mueller is a feisty Italian American, and he said from the beginning he would not plead
[55:06.040 --> 55:09.160]  guilty to things that he had not done.
[55:09.160 --> 55:16.120]  He refused the entreaties of the special counsel to simply roll on Donald Trump.
[55:16.120 --> 55:21.360]  We'll make all your tax problems, all your money laundering problems, if they're real,
[55:21.360 --> 55:22.520]  go away.
[55:22.520 --> 55:24.280]  Just give us the president.
[55:24.280 --> 55:29.000]  Just tell us that you colluded with the Russians and Trump knew everything.
[55:29.000 --> 55:34.960]  Manafort has refused to do this, because to do so, he would have to lie.
[55:34.960 --> 55:37.080]  He would have to perjure himself.
[55:37.080 --> 55:44.360]  And now Manafort strikes back in a devastating lawsuit that cuts to the heart of the abuse
[55:44.360 --> 55:53.240]  of power by Mueller and the Justice Department in this incredible witch hunt.
[55:53.240 --> 55:57.800]  And this is obviously going to be a story we're going to keep tabs on.
[55:57.800 --> 56:02.840]  And as I'm, I didn't even make this connection until just now hearing you talk about this.
[56:02.840 --> 56:11.600]  I'm wondering if there's any connection here with this lawsuit to the timing of this excreation
[56:11.600 --> 56:13.360]  of Steve Bannon today.
[56:13.360 --> 56:18.160]  It was Steve Bannon essentially in these alleged direct quotes in the book that came
[56:18.160 --> 56:27.120]  out saying Manafort was laundering money to Russia through an intermediary Jared Kushner.
[56:27.120 --> 56:30.960]  And that gets published apparently straight out of the mouth of Steve Bannon.
[56:30.960 --> 56:34.040]  He's yet to say that that quote isn't real.
[56:34.040 --> 56:37.760]  Breitbart actually ended up publishing that quote as if it were real.
[56:37.760 --> 56:40.040]  So who knows the story there.
[56:40.040 --> 56:46.560]  But I'm just curious now, I'm wondering if the timing of this is somewhat orchestrated
[56:46.560 --> 56:53.280]  because it's an awfully great coincidence that the same day Manafort is suing back against
[56:53.280 --> 56:56.040]  the Mueller probe for entrapment.
[56:56.040 --> 57:01.520]  You've got Bannon saying that Manafort and Kushner are guilty.
[57:01.520 --> 57:04.360]  So that's just a weird another ripple that we have in this deal.
[57:04.360 --> 57:05.360]  Indeed.
[57:05.360 --> 57:09.800]  Look, I'm not going to criticize Steve Bannon because I don't think infighting in the movement
[57:09.800 --> 57:10.800]  is a good idea.
[57:10.800 --> 57:12.080]  I agree with Steve on many things.
[57:12.080 --> 57:14.920]  I disagree with him on others.
[57:14.920 --> 57:21.160]  He was, you know, he was addressed in the worst dressed list in a jovial manner.
[57:21.160 --> 57:27.800]  And I must say this, Michael Wolfe, the author of this book, has a notorious reputation for
[57:27.800 --> 57:31.880]  falsification of words, lying and making things up.
[57:31.880 --> 57:34.960]  So I'm going to give Bannon the benefit of the doubt.
[57:34.960 --> 57:40.920]  I do know this, all Manafort was not laundering money through Jared Kushner to Russia.
[57:40.920 --> 57:43.320]  It doesn't even make sense.
[57:43.320 --> 57:46.440]  All right, there goes Roger Stone.
[57:46.440 --> 57:47.440]  This is the War Room.
[57:47.440 --> 57:48.440]  We'll be right back.

[59:49.360 --> 01:00:09.200]  The
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:27.040]  Welcome back to the War Room.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:35.520]  I've got a series of video clips here that prove what Roger Stone was talking about here
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:44.080]  on the War Room months ago. That is, they are trying to invoke the 25th Amendment against
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:50.800]  President Trump in order to remove him from office. I've also got a stack of news on that,
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:01:00.160]  especially when it comes to the tweet about or I guess against Kim Jong-un talking about the size
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:10.960]  of their red button. But let's first start with this clip because I mean let's go full on let's
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:15.600]  just get the craziest out there before we even get into the something that actually has a little
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:23.040]  substance to I mean at least they are responding to a tweet but this is a MSNBC clip where they say
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:29.600]  that Trump's sexual insecurity is threatening to annihilate the planet. This is true his sexual
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:36.160]  insecurity folks. Here is a MSNBC going well full Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:43.520]  So this interesting thought from Donald Trump about the size of his nuclear button and the
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.880]  threat that he just put up against the North Korean leader your thoughts.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:53.360]  As we saw all through 2017, men with profound sexual insecurity can wreak a lot of havoc in
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:59.840]  the lives of women in the lives of their families. But perhaps never have we seen men with profound
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:05.920]  sexual and masculine insecurities. To pause it right there. This is the funniest thing that I find
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:12.960]  about mainstream news and this is why info wars is so popular amongst thinking individuals.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:19.840]  Think about this this is how MSNBC conducts this segment. Okay we've got this talking point here
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:25.040]  that Trump is sexually insecure and that's why he sent out the red button tweet to Kim Jong-un.
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.640]  So they're like yeah yeah yeah and so that's their talking point. So then this cone head
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:36.560]  looking individual has to get up here and just force a conversation like well yeah I mean clearly
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:41.520]  he's sexually insecure I mean I've read the tweet we've heard about the small hands he responded
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:47.680]  to the small hands and so they're up here pontificating over a nothing burger over a talking point
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:52.880]  we don't do talking points here we do critical thinking and analysis let's go back to the to
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:59.120]  the talking point cone head. To annihilate the planet I mean the way he's literally capitalizing
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:05.120]  in that tweet his nuclear button I mean any psychiatrist or psychologist would have a field
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:12.400]  day with which he's not in a world which he's not be ended in terms of a habitable planet
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:22.560]  because of the sad man's insecurity. Yeah yeah I don't know who that goon is I wonder I mean I
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:35.680]  don't know Anand Jiri Haradas reports on the nuclear meltdown at Fukushima I mean he's sitting here
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:43.200]  talking about an uninhabitable planet okay how about the nuclear radiation just leaking into
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:51.200]  the Pacific Ocean nonstop for almost 10 years now is it but but nothing but but it trumps sexual
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:58.240]  insecurity is a threat to a habitable planet how about all the chemicals that we know they spray in
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:04.160]  the atmosphere that they put in the water I mean think about that they put chemicals in the water
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:12.720]  that is a basic element for all of life on this planet so they poison the water supply
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:19.200]  that we drink they poison the water supply that we use to water our plants feed our and water our
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:29.200]  animals but but Trump's sexuality is insecure and that is a threat to the habitable planet
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:37.360]  that we live on but but Kim Jong-un though isn't isn't the threat it's president Trump
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:43.600]  now again I'm not even sitting here saying whether I like these tweets or dislike these tweets
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:50.400]  just neutral on that subject I it's just sad this is how MS so he's so Trump then tweets out
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.320]  I will be announcing the most dishonest and corrupt media awards of the year Monday at five o'clock
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:03.280]  Mike in Arizona you're on the air worldwide go ahead oh Alex you can rent any day of the week

[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:14.800]  and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well and as a long
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:20.800]  time info words listener I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force anthroplex my girlfriend
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.520]  would like to say thanks for the anthroplex thank you I use the bio true selenium the super blue

[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:41.840]  you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy absolutely because then we could all as
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:47.760]  educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:52.720]  going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves we can take
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:06:08.640]  our country back
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:34.560]  so you first heard it reported at info wars calm the deep state would be trying to invoke
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:40.480]  the 25th amendment and have president trump removed from office they're laying the groundwork for that
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:44.640]  right now they don't quite have the votes they do believe they can get the votes in the midterms
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:52.480]  they'll be sadly mistaking on that but trump tweets this out yesterday he says I will be
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:56.640]  announcing the most dishonest and corrupt media awards of the year on monday at five o'clock i'm
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:02.160]  assuming that's next week subjects will cover dishonesty and bad reporting in various categories
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:09.360]  from the fake news media stay tuned is president trump serious about this i'm certainly looking
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:14.640]  forward to it in fact he probably is saying that's going to be monday five o'clock eastern
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:19.680]  that's four o'clock central when the war room is live so next monday we might be live when president
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:25.760]  trump i guess moves forward with this plan for the most dishonest media but you can really see
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:32.000]  how they operate as we were playing that last msnbc clip and we've got another nbc clip we've
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:42.080]  got a fox business clip we've got a cnn clip here but you can see what i was talking about in the
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:47.600]  last segment how they have a talking point it's not about here's the research that i did or here's
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:52.960]  what my sources are saying or here's how this is developing it's here's a democrat created
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:58.000]  talking point now let's pontificate on it okay what's the talking point trump's crazy and he has
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:06.240]  a small man part and that's why he is tweeting to kim jong-un okay go and so there they go
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:12.320]  and then the talking point is created and then it manifests itself of course i mean trump did
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:17.920]  create it by saying what he said in the tweet which was north korean leader kim jong-un just
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:22.800]  stated that the nuclear button is on his desk at all times will someone from his depleted and food
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:27.600]  starved regime please inform him that i too have a nuclear button but it is much bigger and more
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:37.040]  powerful one than his and my button works okay now kim jong-un has actually responded to that by
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:44.080]  trying to reach out to have talks with seoul and south korea but regardless look at how they respond
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:50.880]  this is because they're trying to invoke the 25th amendment as we reported months ago cnn says why
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:57.760]  twitter won't block trump despite his nuclear threats oh it's a nuclear threat now it's a
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:06.160]  nuclear threat now when he's trying to stop the nuclear threat that is the radical north korean
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:13.120]  regime trump's the bad guy but yeah they want twitter to block president trump for sure which i
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:18.160]  actually have decided now i hope twitter does block trump i would love for twitter to block
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:23.200]  president trump because the first thing he does is either start a new social network of his own
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:30.160]  or move to gab either one of those formulas means twitter dies so please twitter block president
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.520]  trump but they're smarter than that they know that trump is the only reason why they're probably
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:40.400]  not going under you've got hillary spokesman calls for trump to be banned from twitter over newt
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:46.400]  tweet that's brian fallon so there you go yeah oh how dare he we've got all of these good racist
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:52.240]  liberals tweeting death to president trump tweeting death to white people you know insulting his family
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:57.280]  saying things about baron but trump needs to be banned for addressing the north korean situation
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:06.960]  morning joe trump's nuclear button tweet suggests president is demented and deranged oh i thought they
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:12.480]  were talking about mika and joe as demented and deranged but no i was wrong it was actually trump i
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:17.360]  should have known that though that's just one of their favorite talking points you've got the view
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:26.000]  goes off on trump's intensely phallic intensely phallic they say nuclear brag needs to be medicated
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.360]  and hospitalized again that's probably the entire staff of the view but i digress joy bear says
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:36.400]  trump needs to be medicated and hospitalized at this point or he's just going to kill all of us
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:43.760]  well i would base um i would say my conclusion based on what you said is that you are the one
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.000]  that indeed needs to be medicated and hospitalized and probably putting a straight jacket in a
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:56.560]  rubber room before you kill yourself so then she speculates he'll blow the whole world up
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:03.120]  so that his stupid sons don't have to go to jail boy she really brought into that russian collusion
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:10.160]  thing didn't poison poor joy bear sanny huston noted how people are talking about the 25th
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:17.840]  amendment and a potential mental fitness problem yeah we told you that's what they were going to
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:25.840]  try to do so now you just heard from msnbc his sexual insecurity i mean he's clearly sexually
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:33.040]  insecure i mean how how could you possibly land a wife like malania unless you're sexually
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:38.800]  insecure i mean a woman like that you just need no security at all to try to approach a woman like
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:45.360]  that so so clearly the msnbc really knows what they're talking about there so but this is nbc
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:55.040]  saying that trump's tweet could provoke kim jung un these juvenile and immature and destabilizing
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:01.120]  tweets kind of suggest that and kim jung is far more likely to lash out to attack south korea to
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:06.480]  lash out japan to use his chemical weapons so he's the crazy one that sounds me like he's the crazy
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:11.600]  one so i think this is very destabilizing and this is a tweet that could lead to confrontation and
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:20.000]  maybe even war so it's kind of like the the whole radical islam thing where they'll say you know
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.680]  no don't try to close the borders or or or you know don't say bad things about muslim countries
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:32.160]  otherwise they're gonna try to stab you and kill you and you're like well what it's like the same
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:37.200]  thing here it's like well president trump needs to not talk about kim jung un like that because
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:46.000]  he could use a chemical weapon so he's the bad guy or oh okay well maybe they'll figure that one out
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.400]  maybe they'll just go to north korea well how about that why don't they try to get a comment from
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:56.240]  kim jung un oh because he's a radical dictator and won't talk to you oh okay sorry i forgot about
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:04.720]  that aspect here's brian stelter george castanza of cnn fake news questioning president trump's
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:10.160]  mental fitness jonis now is cnn senior media correspondent brian stelter um any idea exactly
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.080]  what he's talking about this is something he seemed to propose before the new year anderson the idea
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:19.440]  of a fake news trophy that should be awarded the rnc oh you'll be on there buddy said they would take
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:25.120]  nominations it seems the president right out of reality tv here wants to create a moment of drama
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:29.520]  where he'll announce the winners obviously in the fan scheme of things probably they'll pause it right
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:34.960]  there pause right there let's just make sure that we recognize here uh i would say cnn and msnbc
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:39.840]  probably have the most nominations as we prepare for president trump's fake news awards all right
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:44.320]  let's go back to one of the fakest names in news brian stelter the day but this came just a few
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:48.720]  minutes after the nuclear button tweet so what's on the president's mind we know what's on the
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:54.400]  president's mind 16 tweets today to start the new year some of them deeply disturbing right i mean
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:59.280]  the what considering how the new year has started deeply disturbing i mean what does this say about
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:04.960]  the year madness and i think we should start to call it that shouldn't we you know when president
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:09.280]  trump was inaugurated last january some writers some columnists like ender sullivan started right
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:14.640]  away to raise concerns about the president's mental health about his fitness oh in the months
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:19.440]  the followed we saw republican senators like jeff flake by the way pause it right there uh this is
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:28.720]  the same brian stelter the george castanza of news these are the same people that were offended
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:32.800]  that anyone would report on hillary clinton's health do you remember that do you remember how
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.520]  offended they were when people were reporting on hillary clinton's health that's funny how that
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:43.360]  works it's funny how that works you're telling me that a racist liberal on cnn has double standards
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:51.440]  shocking let's go back to george castanza i mean brian stelter try to ask about his fitness for
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:56.960]  office bob corker another name that comes to mind i think we could apply a test to his 16 tweets
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:02.720]  today the test would be if this were the leader of this were the leader of germany or china or
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:08.080]  brazil what would we say how would we cover these tweets we would say these are the messages from
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:12.720]  a person who is not well from a leader who would not fit for office well i mean the the account
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:18.400]  argument to that is look he just has a different style and interesting brian stelter because
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:27.120]  do you even report on anything else other than trump i mean it's a nice proposal that you make
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:34.000]  it's a nice concept you know but have you reported on anything else other than your strange obsession
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:40.720]  with president trump that's the other thing about this brian stelter is so obsessed with president
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:45.520]  trump he would live in his jock if he could he would he would literally live in president trump's
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:50.240]  underwear if he could that's how obsessed with donald trump they are but brian stelter might get
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:16:01.760]  around to covering some other foreign leader maybe we'll find out 2017 has been a earth shaking year
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:08.560]  in 2018 guaranteed is even going to be wilder in fact my good friend stefan malin who said it's

[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:33.040]  is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:39.040]  the antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market

[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:32.960]  against the deep state and now we're actually starting to get some rubber meeting the road
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:40.080]  here you've got manafort about to or has filed a lawsuit against the Mueller probe and then also
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:47.760]  this just broke today from the hill Rosenstein meeting with paul ryan about russia investigation
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:52.160]  that is a confirmed meeting that happened christopher rey was supposed to be there it was not
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:21:03.920]  confirmed that he did actually show up so you have to wonder what that is about why was Rosenstein
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:14.880]  meeting with paul ryan this of course the day after or the day of muhlers but now lawsuit against him
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:23.680]  from manafort the day after trump says hillary's top aide huma ebidine belongs in jail the same
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:28.720]  day that hillary clinton's house catches on fire folks are you starting to see here
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:38.640]  buckle up baby it's 2018 the other story from the hill today congressional investigators find a
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:45.520]  regularity in fbi's handling of clinton email case well yeah peter stroke wrote her off james
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:52.240]  comey wrote her off yeah she broke the law but we changed the terminology in the investigation
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:22:02.320]  though so that she could walk okay yeah bill and hillary kind of realized the heat was really on
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:08.800]  and that the sun is really setting on their crime spree so they nearly burnt their house down today
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:18.640]  yeah yeah yeah it's all starting to move in the direction we expected the whole time
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:27.760]  and people are starting to get it this is a clip of newt gingrich on fox business and again think
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:34.400]  what you want about newt gingrich he was the one who originally said on fox news it was shocking to
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:40.000]  me that he said it that the reason why the media and the establishment is against trump is because
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.320]  he's not in the secret societies i think things are happening i think the congress is doing its job
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:51.600]  i think the news media has begun to realize this is a gigantic story certainly john sullivan and
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:57.680]  others have been doing an amazing job of piecing it together despite enormous resistance from
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:04.080]  the elite media look there are two things i take out of this as a historian one is we now understand
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:10.080]  how close we came to a real disaster of hillary and one the positive right there this is actually the
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:17.040]  key you have to remember when breaking all this down i actually thought i really thought long
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:21.200]  and hard about this last night and we're almost to the point where we have all the connections
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:25.440]  we're pretty much there we know the names we know the dates if you follow this broadcast you follow
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:28.800]  m4 as you follow you know real news of david night and the alex joneshow you pretty much know what's
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:36.240]  going on here um but where does this all originate this is what you need to remember what is the
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:47.120]  base what is the foundation why k bono folks hillary clinton had to win to cover up for
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:54.400]  massive crimes that's what the basis for all of this is that's the desperate campaign that's the
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:59.760]  desperate collusion with the mainstream media that's the desperate lies that's the de desperate
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:06.160]  collusion with the obama doj that's the desperate collusion with the obama fbi that's the desperation
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:12.000]  burning your house that's your desperation erasing emails that's your desperation smashing
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.280]  servers that's your desperation not turning over servers in this investigation do you see
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:23.680]  what's going on so hillary clinton a mountain of criminal activity behind her has to become
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:29.200]  president so that she doesn't go to jail, has to become president so that she hopes
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:31.940]  she can get away with all the crimes she committed.
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:37.840]  She loses, the entire thing falls apart, the FBI collusion gets exposed, the mainstream
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:42.760]  media collusion gets exposed, it's all exposed in the WikiLeaks, it's all exposed in the Project
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:48.020]  Veritas videos, now the reports keep coming out, it's over for her.
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:50.040]  So she gets more desperate and more desperate.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.040]  What's next?
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.820]  Her house is already on fire.
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:53.820]  What's next?
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:55.360]  The entire DNC is going to burn down?
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:00.160]  Here, let's go back to Newt Gingrich, who first said it, Trump is not in the secret
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.160]  societies.
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:06.760]  This would have been swept under the rug, the system would have continued to decay into
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:12.760]  corruption and dishonesty, cronyism would have continued to grow, and in that sense,
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:18.040]  Trump is a disruptive figure who's breaking up the insider deals, the insider corruption,
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.160]  the kind of things that are clearly criminal behavior, and that's important to remember.
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:26.800]  The second thing is, this goes to the heart of the American system.
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:30.080]  We have to rely on the rule of law.
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:32.680]  We are a very diverse country, we have enormous potential.
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:36.960]  And so that, and so pause right there, so this is all out in the open, everyone knows
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:42.480]  it with a brain, and who can read, and so we see the collusion, we see the corruption,
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:47.360]  and so that's why President Trump tweets these things out, like jail for Huma Abedin.
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:51.320]  That's why he tweets these things out, like investigate Lion James Comey.
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:56.720]  That's why he tweets these things out, like maybe the FBI and the DOJ need investigated.
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.680]  That's like his bat signal.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:00.320]  That's like he's the lighthouse.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:03.520]  He's telling you he knows what's going on.
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:07.480]  He's not ignoring this.
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:10.800]  And while it is frustrating, and I've said it here dozens of times, every day Hillary
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:17.480]  Clinton walks free, I lose tolerance, but you can see it's inching closer and closer.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:19.360]  The more details are coming out.
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:22.520]  And so that's why this next clip is so imperative, guys, let's roll to the next clip now.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:29.160]  This is, again, the genie is out of the bottle, the cat is out of the bag, the toothpaste
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:32.300]  is out of the tube, and it cannot be put back in.
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:36.200]  This is judicial watch on Fox Business saying that the Department of Justice has no choice
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.640]  now but to prosecute Hillary Clinton.
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:44.480]  Can the Justice Department now ignore all of these discoveries and not do anything but
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.000]  prosecute this woman?
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.480]  No, they cannot.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:52.560]  And at this point, they go, and that's why Hillary Clinton's house is on fire today.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:59.600]  A de novo or a completely fresh look at this entire criminal enterprise being orchestrated
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:00.920]  by Mrs. Clinton.
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:05.760]  Remember, she set up that email server over which all of this traffic went back and forth.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.240]  Who may have been sending passwords?
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:08.880]  Before she became Secretary of State.
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:12.120]  Classified information on illegal servers.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:18.320]  You know, with full knowledge, intellect, this is a premeditated act on her part.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.320]  They started the dossier.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.200]  They created the fake dossier.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:23.680]  Other senior professionals.
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:24.920]  This is so unreal.
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:25.920]  It's not even funny.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:29.280]  Well, I communicated with her knowing about this outlaw server.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:33.840]  So let me just stop you then, Chris, because what you were saying is it is not just the
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.840]  original matter.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:43.120]  In the original investigation, Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, and Hillary Clinton all denied
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:46.400]  knowing that these classified emails were on these servers.
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.760]  Can you believe that?
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:48.760]  Wow.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:53.240]  Talk about gross incompetence if you believe that.
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:54.960]  But so how did it end up there?
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:58.640]  And why are you deleting emails and smashing servers if you had no idea?
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.640]  Again.
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:00.640]  I mean, now we're looking at perjury.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.640]  Here, finish the clip.
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:06.000]  It doesn't matter with individuals like Huma Abedin and others doing stuff they weren't
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  supposed to do.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.320]  I don't know how these emails got.
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:11.520]  I don't know how this video list got on my desk.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.880]  How did this get here?
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:14.360]  Designed and organized by Huma Abedin.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.000]  I've never seen this before.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.400]  I didn't cue the clips off of this video list.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.400]  That's fake news.
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:23.520]  The liberty was intentional, although intent is not an element of the crime.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:26.160]  It's just, frankly, more fuel on the fire.
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:32.600]  You realize the traditional watch actually got Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, and five others
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.160]  under oath on these very same questions.
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.160]  Bingo.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.160]  And so what?
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.160]  And they lied.
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:39.160]  And they lied.
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.160]  There it is right there.
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:44.560]  So, all right, we're going to break here.
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:45.720]  We're inching closer.
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:46.720]  We've got it all.
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:51.000]  I mean, this is almost an open and shut case as soon as we have a Justice Department that
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  wants to actually give a real investigation, folks, lock her up.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:30:09.240]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick,
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:10.240]  and stupid.
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:11.880]  So, what do we do about it?
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:15.320]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:23.160]  Right back with the all new supercharged Brain Force Plus and feel the rush without the crash.
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:29.040]  Brain Force Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and new tropics.
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:35.480]  And now we've added a brand new ingredient called black pepper fruit extract that gives
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:38.080]  you an added kick.
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:44.360]  Other ingredients include vitamin B12 and neurological tonic and cognitive enhancers
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:50.760]  that will allow you to flip the switch and supercharge your state of mind.
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:52.240]  It's the real deal.
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:54.040]  Brain Force Plus.

[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:04.640]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:11.000]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:18.240]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.480]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:24.160]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:27.840]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:31.720]  with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:34.120]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:36.720]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:39.960]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:44.420]  Senator's Life.com or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, and your purchase
[01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:48.760]  of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:51.200]  the globalist and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:52.200]  And that's who they are.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:58.080]  And they know we know who they are and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:02.080]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:07.160]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:09.480]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.920]  has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.840]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:15.560]  shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:18.600]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.440]  in a highly customized blend.
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:23.680]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:27.240]  100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:30.960]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:32.520]  without the headaches and heartburn
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.400]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:36.280]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee,
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:39.600]  and it's taken us years to secure connections directly
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.440]  to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.960]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two,
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.880]  and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:48.320]  Available in original or with our immune support
[01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:51.120]  infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:53.840]  all the while enjoying a truly great tasting
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:55.560]  cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:57.880]  Available at infowarslife.com.

[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:20.160]  The American Way of Life is under attack.
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:23.760]  This is The War Room with Owen Schreuer.
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:29.240]  Watch the live stream right now at infowars.com forward slash
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:29.740]  show.

[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:42.000]  I am your host, Owen Schreuer.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:47.800]  And in case you haven't noticed, we control the narrative now.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:49.120]  We report the news.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:53.000]  The fake news never sticks because it's just that fake.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.080]  Well, we report sticks and age as well.
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:00.720]  And it's all because of you supporting us at infowarsstore.com
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:03.240]  and sharing the links and telling your friends and family
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:05.160]  about what we're doing here.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:06.960]  And you can see the results, folks.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:07.880]  We are expanding.
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:11.080]  We've got 10 hours of live broadcasting now every day.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:14.080]  We do more extended live broadcasts throughout the year.
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.560]  We're building new studios.
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:18.960]  You've already seen some teasers, if you will,
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:21.200]  of the new studios that we have here.
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.560]  It's all very exciting stuff.
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:24.840]  And you make all of it possible at infowarsstore.com.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.880]  And we try to make it easy for you
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:29.480]  to support us by giving you great specials, great deals,
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:33.000]  and of course, great products.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.040]  So we've decided to extend our new year specials
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.160]  through the rest of this week, I believe,
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:41.040]  through Sunday night.
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.640]  And that includes free shipping storewide.
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:45.520]  Free shipping storewide.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:49.440]  Now, if you're looking for big savings,
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:50.720]  I would say the biggest savings.
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:52.000]  I mean, this is absurd.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.880]  Combined with the free shipping, 50% off all infowarslife
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:58.400]  selects storeable food products.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:03.120]  So half off the emergency food supply,
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:07.160]  half off the infowarslife selects storeable food products.
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:09.280]  That's already hundreds of dollars of savings.
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.760]  That's an expensive item.
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:12.840]  So you get half off of that.
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:16.760]  Then when you combine that with the free shipping,
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:21.560]  you can save hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:23.520]  Because these are heavier items, obviously,
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:25.680]  more expensive to ship.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:28.160]  So if you've ever thought about emergency food
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:31.080]  or you've been on the fence or you haven't financially
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:33.120]  thought it was a good time,
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:36.680]  it's as good a time as any right now
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:38.720]  with the new year's extended specials,
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:43.720]  free shipping plus 50% off the infowarslife selects
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:44.840]  storeable food line.
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:45.800]  And as you can see here,
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:49.080]  if you're watching us on infowars.com slash show,
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.920]  you've got the one year supply, the six months supply,
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:56.440]  three months supply, two weeks supply, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:59.720]  It's all at infowarsstore.com.
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:01.800]  You know, it is freezing out there.
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:07.160]  In fact, they're calling it an Arctic snow bomb
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:12.880]  up there in the northeast.
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:14.720]  So what we have at infowarsstore.com,
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:16.560]  we've got some winter hats.
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:18.400]  So it's wintertime.
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:20.680]  Your ears are cold when you go outside.
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:24.080]  Well, we've got winter hats at infowarsstore.com.
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:26.080]  I actually have the Moan Labe version
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.920]  of the infowars winter beanie myself.
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:33.920]  So winter hats, ball caps, T-shirts, hoodies.
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.280]  It's all at infowarsstore.com
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:38.760]  and it all makes this possible.
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:41.360]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:45.720]  Please launch us to higher levels in 2018
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:47.760]  by supporting us at infowarsstore.com
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:51.360]  and telling your friends and family about what we do here.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.960]  Real quick, while I've got that on my mind,
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:57.000]  snow, sleet, freezing rain hit North Florida.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.960]  So global warming is failing.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:01.600]  I'm actually really upset about that.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:03.240]  I actually like global warming.
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:04.560]  I like a warmer planet.
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:05.800]  I hate winter.
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:09.720]  So I'm just gonna go out and say I'm pro global warming now.
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:10.760]  Hey, there's the winter hat.
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:11.840]  Yeah, that's the one I got.
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.280]  I got the folded one.
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:16.200]  There's also the just straight up beanie one
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:17.040]  that doesn't fold.
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:20.040]  I find that the fold over one is actually warmer.
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:22.600]  And now that global warming has failed us so badly,
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:24.160]  it's freezing in Austin, Texas.
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:26.720]  So I have to wear the warm winter hat.
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:32.560]  Winter storm heading for southeast and northeast really
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:33.600]  is where it's gonna hit.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:38.440]  Bomb cyclone could form off New England coast.
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:40.440]  Now they're already tracking this and showing this
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:43.520]  and it looks like this is going to be a massive,
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:47.320]  massive winter storm hitting New England
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:49.920]  and it's actually approaching the New England coast right now.
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:52.800]  So hopefully it doesn't get too bad up there.
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.600]  What with the snow and the wind and everything,
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:58.600]  but they are expecting some serious winter weather
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:01.400]  to be approaching New England coast.
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:05.760]  Probably tonight, but we'll just keep track of that.
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:09.520]  But where's my global warming guys?
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:14.280]  Please buy a bigger truck, buy a bigger car,
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:17.640]  burn more gasoline, spray as many aerosols into the sky.
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:21.280]  I mean, this is, I'm so sick of winter.
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:24.320]  Come on Al Gore, come on.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:27.200]  Come on guys, you said that we were warming the planet.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:31.160]  In fact, you know what, here's another challenge
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:33.800]  because I'm serious about this.
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:36.000]  Tell me how we can warm up the planet.
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:38.760]  Can someone actually do a report on that?
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:42.400]  There's all this theoretical made up science about it
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:44.520]  that's falling on its face every time from Al Gore
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.920]  and the likes, global warming fails.
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:50.120]  So then they say climate change, what we said originally.
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:51.480]  So here we go.
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:54.440]  Please Al Gore, tell me how I can warm up the planet
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:57.560]  because I will do it just to prove you right Al.
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:00.680]  Al, you've been proven wrong time and time again.
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:03.520]  I'm here offering you a chance to be proven right.
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:05.440]  Tell us how we can warm up the planet
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:07.360]  so we can stop these terrible winters.
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:10.720]  Okay, let's give out the phone number,
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:15.720]  888-201-2244-888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.640]  We've got all kinds of news you can comment on.
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:25.520]  What do you think about the fire
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:28.160]  at Bill and Hillary's house today?
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:29.720]  Is that all just a coincidence?
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:32.280]  The timing of that with Trump's tweets
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:35.920]  and the investigation that looks to be turning its way back
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:37.920]  onto the Clinton camp.
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:40.960]  What do you think about this Bannon-Trump feud?
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:41.920]  Is it real?
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:43.200]  Is it manufactured?
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:44.120]  What is the deal?
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:46.560]  Why is everyone turning their back on Bannon?
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.560]  And does the timing of that also correlate
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:53.360]  with the timing of the Manafort lawsuit
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.080]  against the Mueller probe?
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:58.280]  Because it's said in the book that came out
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:03.800]  that Bannon is saying Manafort and Kushner
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:05.360]  were guilty of treason
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:08.080]  and that there was a meeting that's treasonous.
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:10.680]  And Bannon has yet to make a comment on this.
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:13.520]  The Trumps, well, you've got the letter
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.160]  or the email from Donald Trump,
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.760]  which I'm not positive actually was written from Trump.
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:18.600]  I don't know.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.600]  We haven't actually heard comments from Trump.
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:25.600]  We have had tweets and we've had tweets from Don Jr.
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:28.840]  But regardless of that whole feud
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:31.120]  that I'm not really taking much stake in
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:33.760]  if I'm just telling you my opinion,
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:36.080]  I'm curious of the timing of it all
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:40.280]  because there seems to be some very coincidental timing
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:41.680]  on some of these events today.
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:43.480]  But this is kind of what I expected
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:45.160]  to be happening in January.
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:48.720]  Some of these loose ends coming together
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:52.040]  and some more quote unquote coincidences
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:57.520]  looking more and more like actual developments.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:00.400]  So we're gonna continue to monitor both of those things
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:03.680]  and we'll take your calls on those things as well
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:04.800]  in the next segment.
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:10.700]  Let's just tackle some news here before we take a break.
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:14.600]  We'll just delve into this little short stack I got here.
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:19.440]  New York police hunting for masked ISIS supporters
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:21.960]  who posed in the Big Apple with tear groups logo.
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:24.480]  So we reported on this yesterday.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:27.640]  A couple, I guess, ISIS members or sympathizers
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:30.720]  or whoever these guys were with their hoods on
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:35.320]  and their ISIS masks on taking pictures in front of
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:39.680]  the New World Trade Center and other buildings in New York.
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:41.480]  And so now the police are investigating that.
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:43.320]  And I do believe there was an instance
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:49.040]  where you had a similar situation of an ISIS sympathizer
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.160]  taking a picture, I believe it was on the road
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:58.160]  where the ISIS terrorist took the truck
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:03.160]  up on the curbside and started running people over
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:06.280]  just a few months ago in New York City.
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:11.040]  So the police are investigating into that.
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:15.240]  Huh, it's strange how that works.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:16.920]  You got all these people calling for Trump
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:17.920]  to be censored on Twitter,
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:21.000]  which I dare Twitter to take Trump off, I dare them.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.480]  You will just empower your enemy to come destroy you,
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:27.280]  the enemy that you would create yourself by doing so.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.280]  But, I mean, it's just strange that nobody calls
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:36.960]  for these ISIS sympathizers to be censored from Twitter
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:39.000]  or all these death threats against the president,
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.120]  against Ajit Pai.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:42.920]  I mean, why is that acceptable?
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:47.360]  Oh, because it's liberal, it's liberal.
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:50.240]  If I'm hacking you in the neck with a knife,
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:52.640]  as long as I'm shouting liberal,
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:57.640]  you know, you're gonna accept it, it'll be just fine.
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:58.920]  I'm so excited.
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:01.640]  The new product at infowarslife.com
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:05.520]  in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim,
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:09.040]  filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:12.680]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic,
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:14.560]  but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:17.560]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:20.200]  Quite frankly, I just went off
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:23.840]  what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:25.360]  but it wasn't prescription,
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:30.120]  but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:31.600]  And I came up with our own formula
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:33.720]  working with some scientists and developers.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:38.680]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:41.880]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:44.360]  which is the precursor to all the hormones
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:46.840]  that your body has to have to even make the hormones
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:47.880]  in your glands.
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.680]  It is amazing.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:54.080]  Red pill now available at infowarslife.com
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:57.680]  and your purchase fugs the operation.

[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:02.120]  about to point out three things that will save you
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:04.600]  a lot of money while you get high quality products

[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:32.880]  that you need each month.

[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:31.600]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation,
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.360]  like canning or dehydrating,
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.240]  you know like what you get at the grocery store,
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:37.080]  there is no comparison.
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:41.360]  Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste,

[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:04.080]  The War Ramp.
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:06.760]  Infowars.com ford slash show.
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:08.760]  The War Ramp.
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:35.560]  All right, we are joined by Alex Jones here
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:39.040]  with breaking analysis of the Bannon-Trump feud.
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:40.600]  Alex is on the phone with us now.
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.800]  Alex, what do you got for us?
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:45.080]  Well, you know, we get hit with big stories
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.760]  and it takes us time to do research.
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:49.560]  It takes us a day to do analysis.
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:51.720]  And I got up about six thirds this morning
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:56.160]  and at seven, I saw the one in Guardian had a line
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:00.400]  that Stephen Bannon had set back in November
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:02.640]  right after President Trump had been elected
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:06.240]  in this supposed book called Fire and Fury now.
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:07.440]  That's when they were titled
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:11.000]  from Trump's statements on North Korea a few months ago.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.880]  That Stephen Bannon had reportedly made these quotes
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:15.920]  about, yeah, they should have met with lawyers.
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:18.120]  They shouldn't have met with these Russians.
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:20.040]  Yeah, it could be treason.
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:22.080]  They should have called the FBI.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:25.120]  And I immediately thought to myself,
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:26.320]  well, who is this writer?
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:28.520]  Well, we've got some new developments, though,
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:31.000]  but I'm going to kind of weigh the groundwork first.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.720]  So I looked up this wolf character
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.480]  and he is as bad as Bustick.
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:36.720]  I mean, he is known in liberal journals,
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:39.760]  conservative journals, as somebody that makes up quotes,
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:40.880]  according to all these witnesses,
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:44.720]  somebody that is just somebody that the facts don't jive.
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:48.320]  He's a fiction writer, according to many experts
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:51.760]  who masquerades as a newsman.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:54.520]  So that said, he's an establishment liberal,
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:59.520]  political hack, he's standard, but he's one of the main studs
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:02.040]  when it comes to putting out this info,
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:03.600]  according to all the evidence.
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:08.600]  So I said at 11 a.m. going on, five hours, six hours,
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:12.280]  whatever it was, because I think it was published
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:13.480]  an hour before I even learned about it,
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:15.640]  at 7 a.m. the word is like 5 a.m. or something.
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:17.080]  But I saw it coming in there.
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:18.880]  I said, check the timestamps.
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:23.880]  But I said, this wolf guy is such a known fraud
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:28.240]  that we can't just get a Republican Civil War going on here.
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:30.960]  Right now, but then I kept saying,
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:32.120]  before the show even started, I said,
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:34.400]  but look for Bannon, who were all on computers
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:35.680]  before he started the live show,
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:36.960]  Bannon's statement on Trump,
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:38.520]  Bannon's statement on Wolf's book,
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:40.840]  Bannon's statement on fire and fury.
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:43.120]  I look, I look the whole time I'm on air, four hours,
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:44.160]  nothing, nothing, nothing.
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:48.160]  I just checked before I called in line of the show, zero.
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:49.960]  Now imagine, you know the White House
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.840]  has a bunch of sources inside,
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:56.840]  Breitbart was basically a big part of the final campaign
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:59.200]  and helped during the early stuff.
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:01.520]  So they've had a lot of sources there.
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:02.800]  White House could have called me,
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:05.200]  anybody else too, to check on sources.
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:06.240]  And you know they were doing it.
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:07.440]  So they were asking the same question.
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:10.680]  I was asking you just dawn on me about pretty much ago.
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:11.880]  It was all them asking,
[01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:14.160]  where's Stephen Bannon's statement on this?
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:16.520]  Where's Stephen Bannon's statement on this?
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:18.680]  And some people are like, well, he didn't put a statement out
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:20.640]  because he wants to respond and be bigger tomorrow.
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:22.560]  Well, that tells you just what Trump said in the statement,
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:24.400]  everything is about him.
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:25.680]  If you don't care about the country
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:27.000]  or if you care about fighting globalism
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  or care about or make a marriage a great again agenda.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.720]  Well, then you would sit there and let this come out.
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:35.160]  Maybe wait a couple of days till it builds
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:38.120]  and then come in with your own big news cycle.
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:40.480]  But if it isn't true, you know,
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:43.360]  if the news reports that I'm a child molester,
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:45.680]  unless I'm out of the country or in a coma,
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:47.280]  people are gonna say, where's Alex Jones?
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:49.880]  Hour one, hour two, hour three, hour four,
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:51.360]  hour five, hour six.
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:53.200]  I mean, it's like basically
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:55.920]  almost five o'clock central right now,
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:57.600]  six o'clock Eastern.
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:00.240]  And so let's go back, I saw it at seven a.m.
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:02.600]  So that's three hours, two hours, five hours,
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:03.840]  that's 10 hours.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:07.280]  So we're 10 hours later from when I saw it.
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:10.000]  I've been so busy, I haven't checked the time stamp
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.120]  on the Guardian.
[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:13.760]  So we're 10 hours later here
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:14.800]  and we've not heard from Bannon.
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:18.320]  Well, five hours, six hours into Bannon, not responding.
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.080]  And you know, we got reached out to it.
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:21.960]  A lot of reached out to him, I got his phone number.
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:23.440]  I just leave the guy alone.
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:28.120]  All these hours into this, we don't hear a response.
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:31.880]  That tells you, I think everything you need to know
[01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:33.760]  to make beside with the president.
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:36.360]  But it doesn't matter, the whole thing's a front too,
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:38.960]  because that meeting was about orphans
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:41.680]  and the lady said she had dirt about the buttons in Russia.
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:43.480]  Exposing Russian control of our government
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:45.440]  isn't reason, it's the opposite.
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:47.120]  Whether you're talking to an Eskimo,
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:49.280]  somebody from Mexico, somebody from Germany,
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:51.960]  somebody from Japan, a black guy, a white guy,
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:53.240]  it doesn't matter.
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:55.320]  So the whole thing is a reboot of Russia Gay
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:58.000]  because it's beyond being on its knees.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:58.840]  The wheels have come off.
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:00.320]  And I don't want to fight with Breitbart.
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:02.160]  It's a one-way street.
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:04.520]  Breitbart literally maybe gives us one link
[01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:06.320]  for every 500 we send them.
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:09.360]  Crud does nothing, but just one way it gives us support.
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:12.720]  So it's just an example of how this total one-way deal
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:14.640]  is there's so much good stuff that Breitbart,
[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:17.120]  we promote them, we send them like 20% of their traffic.
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:19.480]  That's mine, because I just want to beat the globalists,
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:22.880]  but it shows you now what Trump's saying.
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:24.280]  It's all about Bannon.
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:25.640]  It's all about him.
[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:27.360]  It's all about him being in control.
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:29.240]  And this is so damaging, driving a wedge
[01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:30.920]  in the Republican Party right now.
[01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:34.680]  That's what I heard about six months ago
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:36.160]  about Bannon trying to do behind the scenes,
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:38.400]  not to reform it, but to take it over.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:40.600]  That why hasn't he responded?
[01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:43.480]  The big thing is why hasn't Bannon responded?
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:45.160]  Why hasn't Bannon responded?
[01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:46.440]  Or is he in a coma?
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:47.600]  Was he in a car wreck?
[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:48.800]  Or maybe I missed it,
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:51.040]  but I had the crew at the office and myself looking.
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:53.240]  You've got like six people running your show right now.
[01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:55.040]  Can we get an answer in the next hour?
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:59.320]  We've got less than one of why 10 hours at least into this.
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:04.320]  Okay, why haven't we heard yet about a statement
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:07.240]  from him, the number one story in the United States?
[01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:09.040]  I'll enjoy it, what do you think?
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.160]  Well, I think that's great, Alex.
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:12.120]  I mean, that's a good idea.
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:14.960]  If we apply public pressure to Bannon
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:16.400]  to try to clear the air on this,
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:17.760]  I mean, that's the headline.
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:21.200]  Alex Jones challenges Steve Bannon to make a statement
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:23.640]  because the silence is deafening right now.
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:25.880]  And you know, here's the only thing about it to me
[01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:28.360]  that I think kind of gets blown out of proportion
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:30.400]  when we talk about driving a wedge
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:32.240]  in between the Republican party.
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:34.440]  I mean, I don't really know what Steve Bannon
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:35.760]  is doing behind closed doors.
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:37.440]  The candidates that are gonna be running
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:40.520]  in the 2018 midterm, some of them have spoken to Bannon
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:42.480]  and they're not even getting a clear picture
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:44.000]  of exactly what Bannon has in mind.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:44.960]  So that's a little strange to me.
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:48.680]  But to me, I have no problem with Steve Bannon.
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:51.280]  I think I probably like a lot of Steve Bannon's policies,
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:54.000]  but Alex, I think he's just, he's a non-entity.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.840]  And if he wasn't before, now he certainly is.
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:58.000]  No, I totally agree.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.280]  With the loss of Moore, that was his water loo.
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:02.120]  It moves on.
[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:04.200]  This just smells desperation.
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:05.840]  Cause it suddenly comes out now.
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:08.240]  It didn't come out before showing collusion
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:10.200]  with his Democratic writer,
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:11.600]  who's been holding on to this interview
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:15.120]  since November of last, not of last year,
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:15.960]  of the year before.
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:17.600]  We're talking 13 months ago.
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.560]  So that's what I'm saying is,
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:21.800]  it could have just been a train wreck or a problem,
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:25.720]  but we're talking 10 hours in on my clock
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.160]  or eight, nine, 10 hours.
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:28.440]  Figure out how you look at it.
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:30.360]  It was published before that, obviously.
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:31.920]  In fact, can we get a time cut on that?
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:33.240]  I'm asking folks to check that.
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:34.760]  The point is, this came out early this morning.
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:36.200]  I saw it at 7 a.m.
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:38.000]  It already was all over the news
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.320]  and a bunch of publications that this had come out.
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:43.120]  You'd think within an hour,
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:45.640]  you'd hear from Bannon, two hours, three hours, four hours.
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:47.080]  So again, I don't wanna wedge.
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.440]  I don't like civil wars.
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:49.560]  I don't like them fighting.
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:51.680]  I don't like getting off on the drama.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:53.120]  And I'm like, almost religious,
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:54.640]  as you know, about not infighting.
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:55.560]  Sometimes I go too far.
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:56.640]  A lot of people run me in the ground
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:58.040]  just because I won't engage in it.
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:54:59.080]  I'm fighting globalist.
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:00.040]  I'm fighting communist.
[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:01.240]  I'm fighting socialist.
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:02.720]  I'm fighting pedophiles.
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:05.920]  I'm fighting vampires.
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:07.560]  Psychic vampires scum.
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:11.280]  But I'm telling you, the fact that he hasn't responded,
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:13.760]  the silence is deafening.
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:16.920]  And I am challenging Steve Bannon to release a statement.
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:18.280]  I mean, I agree with what you're saying
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:20.160]  that he's not that important right now.
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:23.480]  And that's what leans towards the fact
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:26.680]  that he went along with this to try to stay relevant.
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:29.400]  He may become like Beck who became misapologist
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:31.600]  against conservatives in the leftist media.
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:33.840]  And I think he may be going the path
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:36.160]  of somebody he didn't like previously,
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:39.320]  who was, of course, our good buddy Glenn Beck.
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:40.800]  And maybe we'll hear a statement tomorrow.
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:43.560]  There's some reason for this, but just the waiting,
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:46.400]  allowing the cycle to play out, to hurt the president,
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:48.320]  to hurt our movement and all this,
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:49.640]  even if he comes out later.
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:51.920]  I think that's why the president went both barrels
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:55.200]  five hours or more after this happened
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:57.280]  was because the president was waiting, waiting.
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:55:59.640]  You know, reaching out, did you really do this?
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:01.200]  Did you really say this?
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:02.480]  And we got nothing.
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:03.320]  What do you think?
[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:04.160]  Don't enjoy it.
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:06.120]  Yeah, I think you're 100% right.
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:07.760]  And I think that this was a spat.
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:10.840]  If this is, you know, if it really is bad as it looks here
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:12.920]  as far as just a spat between the two,
[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:16.520]  I think that this was a foreign policy spat
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:18.960]  that Bannon and Trump never really saw eye to eye.
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:21.280]  I think specifically it had to do with Israel.
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:24.080]  And apparently it got so intense between the two,
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:26.480]  Bannon had to fracture himself away from Trump
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:28.600]  because of the foreign policy disagreements.
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:31.320]  But Alex, before we go here, we got a minute left.
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:33.320]  What do you think about the timing of this?
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:36.640]  The same day that this becomes a news story
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:38.800]  is the same day that Paul Manafort
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:43.400]  is launching his lawsuit against the Mueller probe.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:44.520]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:47.000]  Moles and Sutton's just coordinated this.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.320]  They had this interview for months.
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:52.200]  This is 100% their next salvo in the new year.
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:54.520]  And it's got fingerprints all over it
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:58.480]  that that's sour plus, sour grapes, loser.
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:01.400]  I don't think he's a loser until he did this, but if he did,
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:03.840]  this loser, piss in the cheerios,
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:06.760]  move, take your ball and go home, situation.
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:10.000]  The timing, not commenting, all of it
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.480]  just absolutely makes me sick to my stomach.
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:15.520]  I wanna know, except for the listeners and viewers,
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:17.880]  Paul Watson's got a poll up on his tweet.
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:19.960]  Who will folks vote for in the next election?
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:22.680]  Will it be Steve Banner or will it be President Trump?
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:24.440]  80% are for President Trump.
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:26.760]  People can vote on that at Prison Planet on Twitter.
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:28.040]  You guys can have the results
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:30.040]  at the end of the hour, the next hour coming up.
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:32.000]  Everybody, we're under censorship and attack.

[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:38.640]  I love you all.
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:39.480]  Great job.
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:41.640]  I want to show you the crew back to the live transmission.

[01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:58.320]  and energy levels, most men know
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:00.920]  that testosterone levels begin to decline,
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:05.520]  starting around 30 at a rate of about 1% to 2% per year.
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:08.640]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue,
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:12.640]  low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:59.440]  In fact, my good friend Stephon Malinu said
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:02.240]  it's gonna be like the Battle of the Gods, Ragnarok.
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:04.320]  So get ready, ladies and gentlemen,

[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:21.880]  The fight for the future is now.
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:26.520]  This is The War Room with Owen Schreuer.
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:32.520]  Watch the live stream at infowarstore.com, 4-slash.
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:43.240]  Well, whatever Steve Bannon did
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:46.920]  to get on the bad side of the trumps,
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:51.560]  he's doing himself no favors by sitting in silence
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:55.600]  as this story continues to build upon itself.
[02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:02.680]  And again, you look at what Steve Bannon
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:05.280]  is saying allegedly in this book,
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:11.240]  pretty much saying that Kushner and Manafort
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:13.680]  were laundering money and committing treason
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:15.200]  by colluding with Russia.
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:19.040]  The same day that gets published
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:22.280]  allegedly from the mouth of Steve Bannon,
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:23.680]  we say allegedly, because Michael Wolf
[02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:25.320]  is known to fabricate quotes,
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:27.720]  but Bannon remains silent, so we don't know,
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:29.120]  and that's not a good sign.
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:35.840]  Manafort pushes back legally against Mueller's probe,
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:42.360]  the same day Bannon alleges statement from Bannon
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:45.920]  gets published in a book saying that they're guilty.
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:50.760]  Now, if that's true, again,
[02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:53.240]  this is what it comes down to for me too.
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:56.000]  Steve Bannon doesn't dictate any policy.
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:59.720]  Steve Bannon is just a guy, he's not in office,
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:00.800]  and I'm not even thinking,
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:02.680]  I don't even think he runs Breitbart.
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:04.560]  I think he is still affiliate,
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:07.320]  but I don't think he's actually running the show over there.
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:11.740]  So why did he pick and choose this battle?
[02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:16.740]  And what we're really seeing now is
[02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:20.620]  if Steve Bannon actually thought that he could best Trump
[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:23.180]  or somehow take Trump's base from him,
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:25.180]  he was sadly mistaken.
[02:02:25.180 --> 02:02:27.340]  Paul Joseph Watson has the Twitter poll up now.
[02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:30.260]  In fact, guys, if you could pull that up.
[02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:32.260]  Steve Bannon says the Don Jr. meeting
[02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:34.420]  with a Russian lawyer was treasonous.
[02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:37.020]  Bannon versus Trump, 2020, who would you vote for?
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:38.340]  Go ahead and select Trump there,
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:40.140]  that's who I would vote for.
[02:02:40.140 --> 02:02:42.740]  That's not even a question, in fact.
[02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:43.740]  So we select Trump.
[02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:46.300]  There's been almost 25,000 votes there,
[02:02:46.300 --> 02:02:51.300]  and Trump gets 62%, only 7% say they would vote for Bannon.
[02:02:53.700 --> 02:02:55.900]  And those are honestly probably detractors
[02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:59.340]  that just went into Paul Joseph's poll to vote there.
[02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:00.940]  I don't know any Trump supporters
[02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:02.700]  that would take Bannon over Trump.
[02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:08.220]  So why is Bannon silent?
[02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:10.580]  What was he thinking?
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:12.380]  And what is he thinking today
[02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:16.420]  as he's now been totally excoriated
[02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:18.740]  what it looks like from Trump's inner circle?
[02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:23.740]  And then what will come of the Manafort lawsuit
[02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:28.740]  pushing back against Mueller in the fake Russian probe
[02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:32.060]  that is nothing more than a witch hunt
[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:36.780]  as a quote unquote insurance policy
[02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:41.500]  that was exposed in the text messages
[02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:44.660]  from the FBI agent, Peter Stroke,
[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:46.420]  who was the same man involved
[02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:47.740]  in investigating Hillary Clinton,
[02:03:47.740 --> 02:03:50.180]  whom Abidine and Cheryl Mills.
[02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:56.500]  So that is going to be fun to watch.
[02:03:57.620 --> 02:04:00.540]  And if you do think Bannon is running Breitbart,
[02:04:00.540 --> 02:04:02.820]  Breitbart publishes this story.
[02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:04.580]  Bannon says Mueller investigation
[02:04:04.580 --> 02:04:08.420]  will target Kushner Manafort's greasy money laundering deals.
[02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:11.500]  So if you think Bannon's running Breitbart,
[02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:12.660]  there's your double down.
[02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:16.980]  There's your lack of denial
[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:21.980]  and still lack of statement directly from Bannon himself.
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:27.180]  So is Bannon now just in the trash heap
[02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:32.620]  or is there another ripple to come of this story?
[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:34.780]  Real quick, we'll take your calls on the other side.
[02:04:34.780 --> 02:04:37.420]  Doug Jones gets sworn in today
[02:04:37.420 --> 02:04:39.700]  as well as Tina Smith from Minnesota.
[02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:44.700]  So 51-49 is now the Republican Advantage in the Senate.
[02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:47.780]  So what happens to Roy Moore's lawsuit
[02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:49.940]  about the election fraud in Alabama?
[02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:52.980]  Not sure, Doug Jones, sworn in today.
[02:04:56.500 --> 02:04:57.940]  Feel your body with carnivore,
[02:04:57.940 --> 02:05:00.900]  the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:03.660]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process
[02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:05.780]  and increase the bioavailability of nutrients
[02:05:05.780 --> 02:05:08.980]  by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:05:08.980 --> 02:05:11.060]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion
[02:05:11.060 --> 02:05:13.300]  caused by fermentation of undigested food particles
[02:05:13.300 --> 02:05:14.260]  in the gut.
[02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:16.780]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:18.540]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes
[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:20.980]  like those naturally present in the body.
[02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:24.140]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:05:24.140 --> 02:05:26.260]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now
[02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:28.820]  while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:31.380]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:33.380]  Just one pill with every high protein meal

[02:05:39.460 --> 02:05:41.500]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes
[02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:43.980]  to help digest fats and carbohydrates

[02:06:08.220 --> 02:06:10.220]  Let's make toG radio great again!
[02:06:12.220 --> 02:06:14.220]  This is the War Room.
[02:06:14.220 --> 02:06:16.700]  War Room

[02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:21.700]  We're about to go to the phone lines here.
[02:06:21.700 --> 02:06:24.700]  You can call in.
[02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:35.020]  888-201-2244-888-201-2244 Steve Bannon, the Clinton's house on fire, global warming,
[02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:37.420]  whatever you want to talk about today.
[02:06:37.420 --> 02:06:43.180]  Real quick before we go to the phone lines, I want to take a second to say happy birthday
[02:06:43.180 --> 02:06:46.140]  to Seth Rich.
[02:06:46.140 --> 02:06:54.020]  Seth Rich would have been 28 years old today had he not been murdered July 10th, 2016.
[02:06:54.020 --> 02:07:01.060]  It is widely believed that Seth Rich was a WikiLeaks source and a Guccifer 2.0 source
[02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:07.300]  to expose the corruption inside the Democrat Party, specifically when it comes to rigging
[02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:10.020]  elections and covering up crimes.
[02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:15.260]  Seth Rich murdered on January, excuse me, July 10th, 2016.
[02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:19.900]  Today would have been his 28th birthday.
[02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:27.220]  And that's an interesting little matzah ball that still sits out there in this crazy world
[02:07:27.220 --> 02:07:32.700]  we currently live in, where some of these investigations are now spinning back and being
[02:07:32.700 --> 02:07:37.900]  aimed at the Clinton campaign, the Barack Obama administration.
[02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:41.980]  Does Seth Rich come up in any of these investigations?
[02:07:41.980 --> 02:07:44.660]  You can only wonder.
[02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:46.780]  Let's go out to the phone lines now.
[02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:49.340]  Let's go to David calling in from Houston.
[02:07:49.340 --> 02:07:50.340]  Go ahead, David.
[02:07:50.340 --> 02:07:53.540]  Hey, what's going on, Owen?
[02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:54.540]  Not much.
[02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:55.540]  What's on your mind?
[02:07:55.540 --> 02:07:56.540]  Two quick things.
[02:07:56.540 --> 02:08:00.540]  One, why can't I listen to your show on the InfoWars live app?
[02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:02.540]  It always just recycles over to Alex's.
[02:08:02.540 --> 02:08:04.980]  Huge fan of yours, by the way.
[02:08:04.980 --> 02:08:05.980]  What's up, Alex?
[02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:08.740]  Two, I have an awesome t-shirt idea for y'all.
[02:08:08.740 --> 02:08:12.980]  It says, if you're still a Trump hater, let me have your extra paper.
[02:08:12.980 --> 02:08:17.340]  You can do the Trump tee like with your t-shirt there with the hat on or with the hair on.
[02:08:17.340 --> 02:08:19.540]  I think that'd be awesome.
[02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:24.340]  Yeah, if you don't like your tax cut, I'll take that extra money from you.
[02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:25.340]  Right, exactly.
[02:08:25.340 --> 02:08:31.860]  I could use it, but I wanted to talk on the weather change, man.
[02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:36.780]  So I lived down here in Houston and I'm sure you're familiar with Kim Trails, but to me
[02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:43.860]  it seems like whenever Trump took office and did his climate executive order, what was
[02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:45.020]  that back in March?
[02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:49.020]  It seemed like some of the Kim Trails, at least majority of the Kim Trails, have seen
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:51.020]  to go away.
[02:08:51.020 --> 02:08:58.500]  Now, if that's into harp and cloud seating and all that fun stuff, I think that the climate
[02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:03.660]  is actually acting the way that it was supposed to have before we started injecting it with
[02:09:03.660 --> 02:09:07.540]  all this aluminum and the Kim Trails and all this stuff.
[02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:10.620]  I just want to see what your thoughts on that would be.
[02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:12.580]  That's actually an interesting angle.
[02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:16.820]  You're not the first person that I've heard notice that and even report on that.
[02:09:16.820 --> 02:09:21.460]  There's other people that have said that they've noticed the same thing.
[02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:26.380]  You know, Geoengineering Watch, their website would probably be a great source to actually
[02:09:26.380 --> 02:09:29.540]  track that information to know if it's accurate or not.
[02:09:29.540 --> 02:09:33.580]  I don't want to comment on the amount of Kim Trails before and after Trump because I just
[02:09:33.580 --> 02:09:36.900]  don't have enough information aggregated to say so.
[02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:44.900]  I mean, I guess it's fair to say that the weather has been different since he became
[02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:45.900]  president.
[02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:50.820]  I mean, you had the massive hurricane season and you have this freak winter season, so
[02:09:50.820 --> 02:09:53.420]  maybe there's something to that.
[02:09:53.420 --> 02:09:55.900]  I just don't have the information to report on that.
[02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:56.900]  Oh, gosh, man.
[02:09:56.900 --> 02:09:58.900]  Well, I appreciate you taking my call, man.
[02:09:58.900 --> 02:09:59.900]  You'll take it easy.
[02:09:59.900 --> 02:10:00.900]  All right, David.
[02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:01.900]  Thank you so much.
[02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:05.860]  Let's go to Victor calling in from Florida where they don't normally get snow, but they
[02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:06.860]  are today.
[02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:07.860]  What's up, Victor?
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:13.780]  Well, I'm not here in South Florida, but up north, I guess I'm gone, but by Tallahassee,
[02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:14.780]  they did, I guess.
[02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:18.860]  Well, I saw it on the local news and I'm glad that you just said that because I saw some
[02:10:18.860 --> 02:10:23.540]  commercials for the local news that they try to make themselves, they kind of separate
[02:10:23.540 --> 02:10:24.540]  themselves.
[02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:27.620]  Now, this is CBS, NBC, local news.
[02:10:27.620 --> 02:10:34.460]  They try to kind of create a wedge between them and the mainstream like NBC and MSNBC
[02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:38.820]  and CNN, and they're saying how they're different and you can trust them.
[02:10:38.820 --> 02:10:42.420]  That's a load of BS, if you know what I mean.
[02:10:42.420 --> 02:10:47.540]  And I wanted to get to the point about Hillary Clinton, actually.
[02:10:47.540 --> 02:10:50.620]  The book that she wrote, I did not read it, but, you know...
[02:10:50.620 --> 02:10:52.180]  You're talking about what happened?
[02:10:52.180 --> 02:10:53.180]  Yeah.
[02:10:53.180 --> 02:10:54.180]  Yeah.
[02:10:54.180 --> 02:10:55.180]  I'm not going to read it.
[02:10:55.180 --> 02:10:56.180]  I'm not...
[02:10:56.180 --> 02:11:03.220]  I don't care to read that garbage, but I was thinking if anyone has read it and anyone
[02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:09.500]  that is like one of those analysts on the CIA and I say that for every 10 words, they
[02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:13.020]  pick one word and then kind of puzzle things together, I don't know.
[02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:17.780]  I may sound like a big conspiracy theorist right now, but maybe she wrote it to kind
[02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:24.140]  of give everyone like that is quote, unquote, on her side, the globalist kind of like a
[02:11:24.140 --> 02:11:27.660]  guideline to go by so that way everyone sticks to the same story.
[02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:28.660]  I don't know.
[02:11:28.660 --> 02:11:29.660]  Just a theory.
[02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:34.820]  Well, here's the thing, I don't think, A, that she wrote it.
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:38.180]  So I'm not really sure if she even knows what happened.
[02:11:38.180 --> 02:11:40.420]  I mean, you know, she doesn't even know what's happening.
[02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:42.300]  So I don't know about that.
[02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:47.180]  As far as them having to stay on message, I think that they pretty much would already
[02:11:47.180 --> 02:11:48.620]  know what to do with that.
[02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:53.460]  They wouldn't necessarily need the book, but I guess if they're worried about some sort
[02:11:53.460 --> 02:11:57.220]  of communication issue, perhaps they think they can put out little messages in the book
[02:11:57.220 --> 02:12:00.260]  to try to keep all of their minions on the same page.
[02:12:00.260 --> 02:12:05.020]  But another reason why she writes that book is because she was so embarrassed by the lost.
[02:12:05.020 --> 02:12:06.740]  Well, quote, unquote, writes the book.
[02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:07.740]  I mean, let's be clear.
[02:12:07.740 --> 02:12:09.940]  I don't think Hillary wrote a word.
[02:12:09.940 --> 02:12:15.180]  She actually had to cover her own skin and make excuses for why she lost.
[02:12:15.180 --> 02:12:18.260]  She was the heavy favorite, according to the fake news.
[02:12:18.260 --> 02:12:19.740]  She had all the big donors.
[02:12:19.740 --> 02:12:23.020]  She had, I mean, she let all, she let all the elite down.
[02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:24.500]  She was the elitist candidate.
[02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:26.260]  She was the big donor candidate.
[02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:28.140]  She let them all down.
[02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:32.620]  So her writing that book was kind of her like, oh, don't blame me.
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:33.780]  Look at everything that happened.
[02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:35.740]  It wasn't my fault, big donors.
[02:12:35.740 --> 02:12:39.540]  It wasn't my fault, $1.5 billion presidential campaign.
[02:12:39.540 --> 02:12:40.540]  Look at what happened.
[02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:41.540]  It wasn't my fault.
[02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:42.540]  Yeah.
[02:12:42.540 --> 02:12:43.540]  That's true.
[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:46.540]  That definitely, I could definitely see that.
[02:12:46.540 --> 02:12:47.540]  Who knows?
[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:49.700]  I'm just glad she's not president.
[02:12:49.700 --> 02:12:52.900]  I was born outside of this country.
[02:12:52.900 --> 02:12:57.940]  I'm actually a legal immigrant to the United States, my whole entire family came here legally.
[02:12:57.940 --> 02:13:03.220]  So we, me and my brother, we both support Donald Trump, my parents, you know, they're
[02:13:03.220 --> 02:13:07.660]  kind of getting around to it, you know, to be honest, you know, they, you know, as most
[02:13:07.660 --> 02:13:13.740]  Latinos, you kind of are brought up in this kind of thing where, you know, Republicans
[02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:18.060]  are only for the rich and, you know, just the typical stuff that the Democrats feed
[02:13:18.060 --> 02:13:19.060]  the minority.
[02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:23.460]  But you're saying with the results that they've seen from President Trump so far, they're
[02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:25.940]  kind of coming around to, to President Trump?
[02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:26.940]  Yeah.
[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:31.420]  They definitely see that, you know, all the, all the stuff is being distorted and they
[02:13:31.420 --> 02:13:32.980]  listen to that.
[02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:37.020]  And I think that's about to be a huge story for 2018.
[02:13:37.020 --> 02:13:41.140]  A lot of these people that have fallen for the fake news talking point start to realize
[02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:42.300]  that they were inaccurate.
[02:13:42.300 --> 02:13:43.460]  They weren't right.
[02:13:43.460 --> 02:13:48.420]  And now they're actually seeing the impact of a President Trump on their daily lives.
[02:13:48.420 --> 02:13:50.740]  Maybe maybe it's safer in their community now.
[02:13:50.740 --> 02:13:54.820]  Maybe they got a pay raise, a bonus, less, less, less taxes being paid.
[02:13:54.820 --> 02:13:59.380]  So yeah, people are going to start to see the results of President Trump manifest in
[02:13:59.380 --> 02:14:00.380]  their own lives.
[02:14:00.380 --> 02:14:03.380]  And if they hated Trump before they might come around, sounds like that might be happening
[02:14:03.380 --> 02:14:04.380]  in Victor's household.
[02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:05.580]  Thank you so much for the call, Victor.
[02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:08.020]  Let's go to John in Tennessee.
[02:14:08.020 --> 02:14:09.020]  Go ahead, John.
[02:14:09.020 --> 02:14:14.220]  Hey, I was going in for two things one real quick.
[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:21.140]  I think you, Rob and Roger need to get together and find y'all five favorite ties and put
[02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:24.980]  them in the store because I love y'all style and y'all fashion.
[02:14:24.980 --> 02:14:28.100]  I would love to be able to own some of those styles myself.
[02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:29.100]  Okay.
[02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:32.900]  So the, we need, you're basically, you're saying info wars needs a line of ties.
[02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:34.900]  That's so true.
[02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:36.500]  I like that idea.
[02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:39.860]  I am a big fan of that.
[02:14:39.860 --> 02:14:43.460]  So maybe, maybe there's someone listening right now that maybe put something like that
[02:14:43.460 --> 02:14:44.460]  into the works.
[02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:47.220]  Hey, I do have this new story.
[02:14:47.220 --> 02:14:52.060]  Manufacturing in the U S just accelerated to its best year since 2004.
[02:14:52.060 --> 02:14:54.540]  So there's another Trump nugget there.
[02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:55.540]  Manufacturing is back up.
[02:14:55.540 --> 02:14:56.620]  That's what Trump said he would do.
[02:14:56.620 --> 02:14:57.920]  Another promise fulfilled.
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:15:01.180]  So hey, maybe, maybe info wars starts manufacturing ties.
[02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:02.180]  I don't know.
[02:15:02.180 --> 02:15:05.180]  Our store continues to expand every day.
[02:15:05.180 --> 02:15:06.180]  Exactly.
[02:15:06.180 --> 02:15:12.380]  When, when, when I tired of it yet, I'm not tired of winning.
[02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:16.020]  No, and it seems like whoever tries to go against Trump loses.
[02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:19.420]  In fact, has anyone won against Trump yet?
[02:15:19.420 --> 02:15:21.220]  Bannon is the latest to fall.
[02:15:21.220 --> 02:15:23.060]  Has anyone won against Trump?
[02:15:23.060 --> 02:15:25.380]  Is there anyone who's actually beaten Trump?
[02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:26.380]  No.
[02:15:26.380 --> 02:15:31.340]  You know, some good food for thought, I think it is.
[02:15:31.340 --> 02:15:33.900]  What if Roy Moore would have won?
[02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:39.180]  And the situation that Bannon sent today would have been a totally different opposition,
[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:40.180]  you know?
[02:15:40.180 --> 02:15:45.580]  I'm not sure, but the thing that frustrates me about this is that that election was, man,
[02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:47.180]  there is so much voter fraud in that election.
[02:15:47.180 --> 02:15:48.180]  It's not even funny.
[02:15:48.180 --> 02:15:51.740]  If you look at Roy Moore's lawsuit, I mean, they've got the evidence.
[02:15:51.740 --> 02:15:52.740]  This isn't even a debate.
[02:15:52.740 --> 02:15:54.060]  You see that in any other election.
[02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:55.060]  It's a red flag.
[02:15:55.060 --> 02:15:58.460]  Matt and Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:15:58.460 --> 02:15:59.460]  Another Matt.
[02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:00.460]  Go ahead.
[02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:01.460]  Yeah.
[02:16:01.460 --> 02:16:04.300]  Hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of, uh, info wars.
[02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:09.780]  And I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic.
[02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:13.900]  And that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the info war.
[02:16:13.900 --> 02:16:18.500]  It might seem like a simple thing, but they particularly these slogan t-shirts that you
[02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:21.260]  guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:22.260]  Well, thank you.
[02:16:22.260 --> 02:16:27.100]  My favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but said it says won't tread on me.
[02:16:27.100 --> 02:16:29.980]  And it's a big day glow snake, Gadsden snake.
[02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.900]  And then it's got the American flag, info wars.com on the right arm.
[02:16:32.900 --> 02:16:38.580]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise
[02:16:38.580 --> 02:16:39.580]  free speech.
[02:16:39.580 --> 02:16:45.140]  And the newest one is trigger warning t-shirt trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol
[02:16:45.140 --> 02:16:49.620]  of a trigger with a yield sign and then info wars.com on the back.
[02:16:49.620 --> 02:16:55.820]  That is the new shirt of the mind available exclusively at info wars.com, not a group
[02:16:55.820 --> 02:16:57.300]  you develop living defense for us.
[02:16:57.300 --> 02:16:58.700]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:16:58.700 --> 02:17:03.420]  Why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much
[02:17:03.420 --> 02:17:04.940]  scares me the most.
[02:17:04.940 --> 02:17:09.740]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[02:17:09.740 --> 02:17:10.740]  my system.
[02:17:10.740 --> 02:17:15.980]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[02:17:15.980 --> 02:17:21.220]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading
[02:17:21.220 --> 02:17:22.500]  disease around.
[02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:25.100]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:26.100]  These are all parasites.
[02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:28.820]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[02:17:28.820 --> 02:17:30.060]  You have the neem in there.
[02:17:30.060 --> 02:17:33.140]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:17:33.140 --> 02:17:36.420]  I recommend doing a parasite plans at least twice a year.
[02:17:36.420 --> 02:17:37.420]  All right.
[02:17:37.420 --> 02:17:39.620]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:17:39.620 --> 02:17:43.620]  It just came back in yesterday living defense info wars live.com and folks, you can't lose
[02:17:43.620 --> 02:17:44.620]  full of stuff.
[02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:49.740]  It's great for your body period and you support the broadcast info wars live.com.
[02:17:49.740 --> 02:17:51.980]  Thank you doctor group from the global healing center.
[02:17:51.980 --> 02:17:56.740]  Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product.
[02:17:56.740 --> 02:17:59.740]  Introducing cell force by info wars life.
[02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:04.180]  Cell force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:06.940]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:09.580]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[02:18:09.580 --> 02:18:14.260]  Cell force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria much
[02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:20.180]  like a cellular engine overhaul because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency
[02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:23.660]  then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[02:18:23.660 --> 02:18:29.020]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these
[02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:31.740]  reactive oxygen species.
[02:18:31.740 --> 02:18:36.780]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[02:18:36.780 --> 02:18:41.580]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:44.340]  species and other free radicals.
[02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:49.420]  Boost, protect and adapt with cell force from info wars life.
[02:18:49.420 --> 02:18:56.140]  Head to info wars life.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:18:56.140 --> 02:19:02.500]  We have developed with the top firms of the United States powerful 50 billion live organism
[02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:10.460]  probiotic fluorolive that is so critical to having a healthy gut and a healthy life and
[02:19:10.460 --> 02:19:13.740]  that has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[02:19:13.740 --> 02:19:19.020]  The other part is a compound like Mycos EX that has all these key ingredients of organic
[02:19:19.020 --> 02:19:23.540]  herbs and other systems that are known to break down this garbage in the body.

[02:23:31.860 --> 02:23:36.460]  so soon I want to just point out two positive things that happened today mostly with the
[02:23:36.460 --> 02:23:41.580]  kindergarten and first graders we took a vote on who wanted to do a YouTube search about
[02:23:41.580 --> 02:23:49.300]  learning about our country USA the vote with vote was basically unanimous so thanks to
[02:23:49.300 --> 02:23:54.740]  you we're connecting there and we're going to get the thumb folks and I'm going to share
[02:23:54.740 --> 02:23:59.380]  them around to try to get President Trump into our public school in West Harlem now
[02:23:59.380 --> 02:24:06.460]  are you talking about the book that Alex was talking about today the thump the Trump rabbit
[02:24:06.460 --> 02:24:13.860]  oh okay so I'm going to go right now in order those and that's the positiveness we had because
[02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:18.540]  of you I wish you could see it it's really fun you know that's so awesome too because
[02:24:18.540 --> 02:24:23.500]  I remember yesterday we talked about the idea where you could expose their double standard
[02:24:23.500 --> 02:24:30.100]  by having you know liberal books the anti-conservative books in there you know they would accept
[02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:33.500]  and then you try to bring in a Trump book and they would reject it yeah there's the book
[02:24:33.500 --> 02:24:38.940]  right there limited edition thump book and post your combo at infowarstore.com yes I'm
[02:24:38.940 --> 02:24:44.380]  going there right now well that's so great thank you so much for your support thank you
[02:24:44.380 --> 02:24:49.660]  so much for caring about those children's future as well and thank you for you Owen God bless
[02:24:49.660 --> 02:24:54.900]  you there goes Alina she is one of our regular callers she works in the public school system
[02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:59.580]  up there in New York and she's constantly giving us updates about what she's seeing up there
[02:24:59.580 --> 02:25:09.420]  let's go to Larry in Mississippi go ahead Larry hey Owen happy holidays to you was that
[02:25:09.420 --> 02:25:24.060]  like a hey Owen yeah go ahead I am I am so happy that y'all are on radio I'm concerned
[02:25:24.060 --> 02:25:32.980]  fact they keep President Trump seems like it in the dark all the time well I'll tell
[02:25:32.980 --> 02:25:36.700]  you what it's interesting that you I actually want to talk about that because it's interesting
[02:25:36.700 --> 02:25:43.140]  that you bring that up well one we use the talk radio format because it allows us to
[02:25:43.140 --> 02:25:49.180]  reach out and hear from the audience and it's teleprompter free talking point free you know
[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:53.380]  free thought critical thinking critical analysis so that's why we go with the talk radio format
[02:25:53.380 --> 02:25:58.380]  which I think is the best and the people are more gravitating towards instead of the canned
[02:25:58.380 --> 02:26:03.580]  type of news you see on television we don't have a teleprompter here secondly what you're
[02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:10.060]  talking about with the president being shut out is actually very key now President Trump
[02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:16.980]  had multiple dinners at Mar-a-Lago over the holiday season and let's just say I happen
[02:26:16.980 --> 02:26:24.860]  to be privy about some of what went down at those dinners let's use one example Michael
[02:26:24.860 --> 02:26:31.740]  Savage Michael Savage had Donald Trump on his radio show multiple times before the presidential
[02:26:31.740 --> 02:26:38.620]  election and then even had a direct pipeline to President Trump after he was inaugurated
[02:26:38.620 --> 02:26:44.540]  and even attended I believe it was an Easter I think it was an Easter meal at Mar-a-Lago
[02:26:44.540 --> 02:26:51.700]  with President Trump and then seemingly after that dinner Savage totally out of touch with
[02:26:51.700 --> 02:26:55.260]  Trump he doesn't understand he complains about it on his radio show he's not sure what's
[02:26:55.260 --> 02:27:03.780]  going on why isn't Trump listening well Michael Savage gets invited to I actually think two
[02:27:03.780 --> 02:27:08.740]  of the dinners at Mar-a-Lago yes two dinners at Mar-a-Lago over the holiday season talks
[02:27:08.740 --> 02:27:17.660]  to Trump and finds out that indeed someone within Trump's team I suppose is keeping
[02:27:17.660 --> 02:27:24.060]  certain personalities or people from getting their message to President Trump and when
[02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:29.900]  he find out when he found out about that he was not happy about it now having said that
[02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:36.620]  just because people are trying to stop things from getting to Trump they still get to him
[02:27:36.620 --> 02:27:44.700]  whether it be his own efforts or because he's so busy let's say a Don Jr telling him something
[02:27:44.700 --> 02:27:51.100]  or a Hope Hicks or a Stephen Miller floating something across his desk so he's still able
[02:27:51.100 --> 02:27:56.660]  to get some of the intel but but your your intuition is right there is a filter that
[02:27:56.660 --> 02:28:01.260]  people are trying to stop Trump from hearing from some of his biggest supporters absolutely
[02:28:01.260 --> 02:28:07.700]  you remember how long that Joe Arpaio was languishing out there till then perfect example
[02:28:07.700 --> 02:28:11.060]  perfect example so what happens see that's the perfect example and Alex was talking about
[02:28:11.060 --> 02:28:16.380]  that today Trump doesn't get the information for some reason it's getting blocked so we
[02:28:16.380 --> 02:28:20.820]  keep hammering it Alex Jones keeps filing reports Alex Jones keeps reporting on it Alex
[02:28:20.820 --> 02:28:24.460]  Jones puts out a special report saying please President Trump you need to know about this
[02:28:24.460 --> 02:28:31.980]  reaches out with his direct line and then what happens Trump pardon Sheriff Joe and
[02:28:31.980 --> 02:28:39.220]  I'll tell you what and I would say expect something perhaps let's just say Trump knows
[02:28:39.220 --> 02:28:43.980]  who his friends are and he will be loyal to those that are loyal to him I'll just leave
[02:28:43.980 --> 02:28:47.660]  it to you like that Larry if you got something else we'll hold Larry over because I was talking
[02:28:47.660 --> 02:28:55.660]  over and this is the war room we'll be right back

[02:33:24.900 --> 02:33:28.900]  segments left we're holding larry over because i was talking over him in the last segment
[02:33:28.900 --> 02:33:33.500]  so we're going to let larry finish his thought over there in mississippi go ahead larry hey
[02:33:33.500 --> 02:33:43.220]  oh and uh how about those cowboys out west that lose brazenly it turns up that uh for
[02:33:43.220 --> 02:33:50.220]  our congressman that just retired don't try to put that together with the chinese for
[02:33:50.220 --> 02:33:55.900]  what do you call it the windmill you know what i'm not sure exactly what you're talking
[02:33:55.900 --> 02:34:03.460]  about but i'll kind of go off on a jag there's people that think these fires in california
[02:34:03.460 --> 02:34:10.060]  may have been started by let's just say a potential land buyer like a chinese government
[02:34:10.060 --> 02:34:19.500]  trying to sweep up a bunch of property at a very low price i don't doubt that i think
[02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:23.580]  that those but i think a lot of those fires in california were definitely started by someone
[02:34:23.580 --> 02:34:31.500]  yes arson terrorism yeah when the cowboys were out there trying to they had grazed property
[02:34:31.500 --> 02:34:37.860]  for over a hundred years nobody had a problem with it and then snipers from the government
[02:34:37.860 --> 02:34:46.060]  come in and okay you're talking about the bundy deal yes oh okay you're saying the blm was
[02:34:46.060 --> 02:34:52.700]  trying to take the land from the bundy's to sell to the chinese well who the congressman
[02:34:52.700 --> 02:35:00.260]  from last basis wondered you're talking about harry reid yeah harry reid harry reid was trying
[02:35:00.260 --> 02:35:05.100]  to do dirty deals with the chinese and he was using his son as a conduit yeah yeah so
[02:35:05.100 --> 02:35:08.700]  that stuff is definitely a potential you've got chinese agents that have infiltrated the
[02:35:08.700 --> 02:35:11.700]  u.s. government hillary clinton probably one of them that's why she just has these wide
[02:35:11.700 --> 02:35:15.820]  open servers with all these classified documents on it you know you leave a nice little document
[02:35:15.820 --> 02:35:18.460]  in there you tell them it's there they go hack it and steal it and then you get a little
[02:35:18.460 --> 02:35:22.740]  donation to your your foundation that's how the clinton's work larry thank you so much
[02:35:22.740 --> 02:35:31.220]  for the call let's go to john calling in from houston now go ahead john hey hey oh and how's
[02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:39.540]  it going it's going good just wanted to see if you had noticed the revolution in iran
[02:35:39.540 --> 02:35:46.900]  bearing any similarities to the the revolution in syria and the revolution in ukraine you
[02:35:46.900 --> 02:35:51.940]  know these color revolutions well i think they're all tied together i don't know about
[02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:56.180]  similarities i don't know if i could say i noticed similarities i mean this seems to
[02:35:56.180 --> 02:36:03.940]  be at least for now organic people on the streets uprising whereas in saudi arabia there
[02:36:03.940 --> 02:36:12.740]  was a kind of a royalty purge if you will but i do think they're connected well the
[02:36:12.740 --> 02:36:20.660]  there's this group the the people's new jahidin of iran called on washington brussels and the
[02:36:20.660 --> 02:36:26.060]  security council to intervene their cia supported group so i mean you know it's straight up just
[02:36:26.060 --> 02:36:34.580]  terrorism from what side are you saying the people revolting against the government like
[02:36:34.580 --> 02:36:39.100]  they're made like the main group it's literally called the people so are you saying you're
[02:36:39.100 --> 02:36:45.060]  a pro iranian regime right now no anti iranian are extremely extremist so they're using
[02:36:45.060 --> 02:36:49.780]  extremely extremist to spearhead the revolution that's that's what i'm saying so it's like
[02:36:49.780 --> 02:36:56.100]  uh i don't think anyone's actually going to intervene on their behalf but they uh they're
[02:36:56.100 --> 02:37:00.180]  asking for help so that's kind of similar to what happened in ukraine when they were uh
[02:37:00.180 --> 02:37:04.100]  they toppled the uh existing government and then asked for help from the west and it pretty
[02:37:04.100 --> 02:37:12.180]  much never happened well it's definitely going to be something to monitor and steve pacenek
[02:37:12.180 --> 02:37:17.980]  was on the alex jones show yesterday saying he wants there to be a regime change which
[02:37:17.980 --> 02:37:22.260]  gets a little help from you know western people and you know perhaps proxy armies i'm not sure
[02:37:22.260 --> 02:37:29.940]  if that's actually going on but i don't know to me i haven't really wanted to get too much
[02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:35.780]  into it because i feel like maybe the people of iran can settle this for themselves and
[02:37:35.780 --> 02:37:40.500]  i'm going to wait and see kind of the results of all this before i make a judgment about
[02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:45.740]  what's actually happening there but you know i mean this story came out of egypt female
[02:37:45.740 --> 02:37:51.820]  pop star arrested in egypt over sexually suggested uh suggestive music video so this is just
[02:37:51.820 --> 02:37:58.100]  what you get in these muslim states you know women have no rights women have to cover their
[02:37:58.100 --> 02:38:03.620]  faces women have to go around with men it's the crazy radical you know yeah so so now
[02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:08.300]  south arabia and iran all the sudden have tried to liberalize and i think in iran they're
[02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:11.380]  going to get away with that they're going to do away with headscarfs so they're in
[02:38:11.380 --> 02:38:15.940]  some kind of pr you know battle now to all the sudden to appear liberal but i mean i'm
[02:38:15.940 --> 02:38:21.660]  sure no one's buying it you know what i mean well it's weird that they don't get any coverage
[02:38:21.660 --> 02:38:25.260]  from the liberals you know it's funny that you say that because the liberals completely
[02:38:25.260 --> 02:38:28.540]  ignore this i mean they're the ones for women's rights and they're the ones ignoring these
[02:38:28.540 --> 02:38:33.500]  protests yeah that's that's interesting i had no coverage at all i'm not sure what to
[02:38:33.500 --> 02:38:38.820]  make of that nothing nothing from liberal media yeah quite odd yeah i haven't heard about
[02:38:38.820 --> 02:38:44.340]  linda sarsour going to iran to join in the protest i haven't heard a linda sarsour taking
[02:38:44.340 --> 02:38:49.180]  the women's march to iran ever funny how that works that that's not a good sign yeah that's
[02:38:49.180 --> 02:38:54.660]  not something that's weird well that to me says that maybe perhaps it is organic but
[02:38:54.660 --> 02:38:58.060]  it really doesn't matter linda sarsour isn't putting foot on foreign soil with her message
[02:38:58.060 --> 02:39:03.300]  anyway she's a fraud yeah absolutely that's that's right absolutely yeah the biggest thing
[02:39:03.300 --> 02:39:09.460]  to me about the iranian thing would be the silence from the liberal media as far as what's
[02:39:09.460 --> 02:39:13.740]  happening there i'm gonna wait and kind of see where some of the leaves fall on the ground
[02:39:13.740 --> 02:39:17.940]  before i go and make a judgment there john thank you so much for calling in let's cram
[02:39:17.940 --> 02:39:26.860]  in eric in florida go ahead eric hey elin how you doing doing good great new year huh
[02:39:26.860 --> 02:39:31.940]  pretty good pretty good so far in 2018 i think hillary clinton's freaking out absolutely
[02:39:31.940 --> 02:39:40.420]  so that brings me to uh lose to where i'm going do you think maybe they had a bunch
[02:39:40.420 --> 02:39:46.940]  of paperwork in half by eleven or that storage facilities over all the years before everything
[02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:54.420]  became computerized and you know they put out fires but maybe they didn't know how to
[02:39:54.420 --> 02:40:00.140]  put out a real fire that really burns your skin and everything maybe they didn't have
[02:40:00.140 --> 02:40:08.580]  a chimney sweep and they had a chimney fire well who knows who knows what happened with
[02:40:08.580 --> 02:40:15.220]  the fire who knows if we'll ever really know but i mean my goodness if it isn't a coincidence
[02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:20.700]  as we see all these developments moving closer and closer to hillary clinton finally reaching
[02:40:20.700 --> 02:40:30.980]  justice for all her crimes a fire is reported at their home company take all the paperwork
[02:40:30.980 --> 02:40:38.100]  away yeah i mean this is the same people that got caught on camera trying to remove voting
[02:40:38.100 --> 02:40:45.300]  records from scenes illegally these are the same people that have been caught smashing
[02:40:45.300 --> 02:40:49.660]  cell phones smashing servers not turning over servers deleting emails so it would just go
[02:40:49.660 --> 02:40:53.700]  right along with everything else they do if they were trying to burn evidence in the clinton
[02:40:53.700 --> 02:41:00.500]  house today they did not have put out the real physical fire or they added chimney fire
[02:41:00.500 --> 02:41:07.260]  i mean it's all open but that's well who knows we'll have to find out if or even if we will
[02:41:07.260 --> 02:41:11.420]  find out about it i don't know if the chap a qual police or fire is going to make a statement
[02:41:11.420 --> 02:41:17.620]  about if they found anything there is but i will say this if hillary clinton is actually
[02:41:17.620 --> 02:41:23.420]  wearing an ankle bracelet as people are rumoring as part of whatever investigation is going
[02:41:23.420 --> 02:41:29.020]  on then they'll investigate what she was burning i promise you that then it becomes a serious
[02:41:29.020 --> 02:41:33.780]  investigation and now she might even be looking at some other crime for trying to cover up
[02:41:33.780 --> 02:41:38.020]  that if that's actually the story all right eric thank you for the call lori you are going
[02:41:38.020 --> 02:41:43.540]  to close out the segment from ohio go ahead hi oh and how are you good happy new year

[02:42:00.500 --> 02:42:06.340]  i was looking up the train derailment i saw another feed off of there and there was an
[02:42:06.340 --> 02:42:13.340]  article about how that area is rich in natural gas and oil for drilling oh so you so you're
[02:42:13.340 --> 02:42:17.780]  saying someone might want to come try to buy up that nutrient rich land like the chinese
[02:42:17.780 --> 02:42:23.460]  that are doing that all over the south asian seas could be the possibility and the other
[02:42:23.460 --> 02:42:27.780]  thing i want to mention too is how ridiculous are they going to get about i mean first of
[02:42:27.780 --> 02:42:32.580]  all hey ten lefties why don't you get your minds out of the gutter maybe his comment
[02:42:32.580 --> 02:42:37.860]  about the nuclear button had nothing to do with nothing but nuclear arsenal and the power
[02:42:37.860 --> 02:42:43.580]  to do something well it obviously did no but see that's the thing they don't understand
[02:42:43.580 --> 02:42:48.020]  trump's nuance they don't understand the nuance they don't understand what trump does on his
[02:42:48.020 --> 02:42:53.020]  twitter because they just live in this complete hatred of trump all right final segment on
