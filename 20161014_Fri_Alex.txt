[00:00.000 --> 00:20.680]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:20.680 --> 00:37.240]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:37.240 --> 01:02.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this 14th day of October 2016, we are now
[01:02.080 --> 01:08.760]  only 24 days out. I've really sat back and looked at the huge spectrum of news and my
[01:08.760 --> 01:14.880]  analysis I know is dead on because it's so incredibly obvious I'm sure that even main
[01:14.880 --> 01:18.920]  line media knows this is a fact, they are trying to steal this election from the American
[01:18.920 --> 01:28.040]  people and from Donald Trump, every metric shows it. You've got major algorithm companies,
[01:28.040 --> 01:32.320]  you've got major professors, you've got major institutions that have never been wrong about
[01:32.320 --> 01:38.160]  elections saying Trump is the odds on favorite. Then you've got mainstream New York Times
[01:38.160 --> 01:44.080]  saying 80 something percent chance in our algorithm he's going to lose and even when
[01:44.080 --> 01:49.360]  he's 15 points ahead they'll just come out with a scandal and then claim that it's putting
[01:49.360 --> 01:55.360]  behind again when you actually go to the algorithms from even Google itself to story up on Infowars.com
[01:55.360 --> 01:58.560]  that is so important to get out to everybody and we're also going to add to this some of
[01:58.560 --> 02:04.520]  the past algorithms because it's not just one Google trends shows Internet users far
[02:04.520 --> 02:15.280]  more interested in WikiLeaks than Trump allegations at a level in some cases of 10 to one. It's
[02:15.280 --> 02:23.080]  incredible. It's amazing. I mean on the graph here we've got areas where there's an interest
[02:23.080 --> 02:35.720]  in the Trump sex scandal, the pottymouth scandal of 4% with an interest at 100% being the benchmark
[02:35.720 --> 02:45.960]  for WikiLeaks. 100 versus 4. I want to say 10 times. I tend to average down with an estimation
[02:45.960 --> 02:51.920]  but on average I mean we're talking 10 times. You look at the graph yourself. In fact just
[02:51.920 --> 02:55.360]  eyeballing it. We should have a mathematician do it. It looks probably more than like 15
[02:55.360 --> 03:04.080]  times on average but he gets 20, 30, 40, 50,000, turns away 20,000, lines for two, three miles
[03:04.080 --> 03:08.400]  away like we saw in Austin, Texas when he was here a few months ago. Hillary can't even
[03:08.400 --> 03:15.840]  get 200 people on average. She has to go to city events or concerts or other things. They
[03:15.840 --> 03:20.160]  already have thousands of people and then she just gets up there and addresses it forcing
[03:20.160 --> 03:26.000]  herself into the public consciousness. So what's going to happen? They are organizing
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.240]  big time to steal this election and I don't say that so that then people lose confidence
[03:32.240 --> 03:36.640]  and don't go out and vote. The answer is go out and vote and fight for the right of this
[03:36.640 --> 03:40.960]  representative republic so we can also have eyes on the ground to illustrate especially
[03:40.960 --> 03:45.080]  in battleground states what's happening and we're going to then fight for this election
[03:45.080 --> 03:48.920]  if there's evidence of theft and it's already coming in in New York with the early voting,
[03:48.920 --> 03:52.960]  the head of New York elections is a democrat saying it's total fraud. We played that just
[03:52.960 --> 03:56.640]  a few days ago. We should put a special report together with that. It's so incredible. Election
[03:56.640 --> 04:00.800]  fraud already happening. Evidence is coming in early voting. It's the same thing in Florida.
[04:00.800 --> 04:09.000]  Democrats bragging there. We have the UN. We have the OECD's military intelligence
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.320]  corps of the EU coming in and saying they're going to run our elections. We have Homeland
[04:14.320 --> 04:24.680]  Security saying they're going to federalize the election. Who told you first? I did. I
[04:24.680 --> 04:28.080]  knew it was coming. Trump came out, exposed it, then they came out and said there's no
[04:28.080 --> 04:30.880]  such thing as election fraud but we've got to federalize everything because election
[04:30.880 --> 04:37.480]  fraud is such a giant threat by Donald Trump, the American people and the Ruskies. Yep,
[04:37.480 --> 04:42.120]  elections official caught on video blasting the Blasio's ID program saying it lets dead
[04:42.120 --> 04:46.960]  people illegal if you name it a vote. That's on screen for TV viewers but it's not just
[04:46.960 --> 04:52.840]  that form of outside manipulation or election fraud. It's Donald Trump to claim Mexican billionaire
[04:52.840 --> 04:57.240]  Carlos Slim behind New York Times sex assault stories, Wall Street Journal. Well, of course
[04:57.240 --> 05:03.040]  he's behind it. Russia has ordered all of its officials to fly home including any relatives
[05:03.040 --> 05:08.360]  living abroad. This news comes as tension mounts over the prospect of pending global war. A
[05:08.360 --> 05:12.320]  failure to heed the instruction could put promotion chances at risk. According to local
[05:12.320 --> 05:16.200]  reports from Moscow, this news comes amid worsening relations between Russia and the
[05:16.200 --> 05:20.640]  U.S. over Syria. Politicians and high-ranking figures are said to have received a direct
[05:20.640 --> 05:24.840]  warning from Russian President Vladimir Putin. This news comes as Putin has canceled a planned
[05:24.840 --> 05:29.720]  visit to France amid conflict over Moscow's role in the Syrian theater. Just days after
[05:29.720 --> 05:35.160]  this news emerged, the Kremlin has moved nuclear capable missiles near the Polish border. Russian
[05:35.160 --> 05:39.960]  political analyst Stanislav Vilkowski said this is all part of a package of measures
[05:39.960 --> 05:45.160]  to prepare elites to some big war. Relations between Russia and the U.S. are at their lowest
[05:45.160 --> 05:50.120]  since the Cold War and continue to deteriorate. Even former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
[05:50.120 --> 05:54.720]  is warned the world is in a dangerous point due to rising tensions between Russia and
[05:54.720 --> 05:58.640]  the U.S. I'm Margaret Hale reporting for Infowars.com.

[08:23.360 --> 08:31.640]  Alex Jones.
[08:31.640 --> 08:37.500]  Only 24 days left, ladies and gentlemen. I'm your host, Alex Jones. Now, we've seen top
[08:37.500 --> 08:41.560]  professors that have never been wrong about calling U.S. elections where their computer
[08:41.560 --> 08:47.720]  algorithms come out and say 80 plus percent chance Trump's going to win. We've seen major
[08:47.720 --> 08:52.960]  corporations with their big analytics tools say that interest and positive mention for
[08:52.960 --> 08:59.200]  Trump on average is dozens and dozens of times, depending on which algorithm, but stratospherically
[08:59.200 --> 09:05.960]  better for Hillary Clinton. We see that manifest on the ground where he gets 20, 30, 40, 50,000
[09:05.960 --> 09:14.120]  people at rallies. Small towns unannounced, 5,000 in an hour show up. But there's a new
[09:14.120 --> 09:22.000]  algorithm out from the ultimate data collection system. Google Trends shows Internet users
[09:22.000 --> 09:29.400]  far more interested in WikiLeaks than Trump allegations. WikiLeaks, search term versus
[09:29.400 --> 09:37.440]  Trump pussy, excuse the French, but this is news, 25 times we've done the math or 2,500
[09:37.440 --> 09:44.480]  X. That's in Paul Joseph Watson's article with the live graph for you. And that's on
[09:44.480 --> 09:51.960]  a good day when they've got their higher numbers that WikiLeaks is only 25 times or
[09:51.960 --> 10:02.640]  2,500 X above it. This is what we see time and time again. Trump videos on YouTube will
[10:02.640 --> 10:07.360]  get hundreds of times the views of Hillary videos. I mean, you go to her YouTube page,
[10:07.360 --> 10:11.400]  her top videos maybe have 50,000 views, most of them a couple thousand Obama's videos
[10:11.400 --> 10:16.800]  on the White House channel have a couple thousand usually. I mean, it's incredible.
[10:16.800 --> 10:20.800]  The average Donald Trump video they put out millions, ours millions, thousands of channels
[10:20.800 --> 10:26.040]  on YouTube with millions of views per channel, sometimes per video. Yeah, I don't know the
[10:26.040 --> 10:32.280]  math on this, but it's straddles fury. And the final days of this campaign, more and
[10:32.280 --> 10:35.800]  more, I just want to show people the polls, the numbers, the real science versus what
[10:35.800 --> 10:43.880]  mainstream media says. It's incredible. And then you look at the Republicans, Trump has
[10:43.880 --> 10:47.800]  raised them, the Republican Party, separate from what he's given himself over 100 million
[10:47.800 --> 10:54.520]  of his own money, $168 million as of today. Do you know much? How much the Republican
[10:54.520 --> 10:59.200]  Party has done for TV ads for him, even though half that money that he is the head of the
[10:59.200 --> 11:08.720]  RNC now is supposed to go to the presidential front runner, the nominee, zero. And the Washington
[11:08.720 --> 11:12.240]  Post was reporting this morning like it was a good thing. Look, the Republicans don't
[11:12.240 --> 11:21.440]  like Trump good. How dare him, bitch, a sore loser that they've given zero, zero before
[11:21.440 --> 11:29.400]  the stupid potty mouth controversy. And now they're on record calling every contestant
[11:29.400 --> 11:36.440]  they can get ahold of over 30 years of beauty pageants he put on to find a few mentally
[11:36.440 --> 11:41.480]  ill or sour grape women. And they've only found a couple after interviewing hundreds
[11:41.480 --> 11:44.240]  and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of women doing everything they can. The New York
[11:44.240 --> 11:50.440]  Times around the clock is doing this. And a lot of the women getting called now, and
[11:50.440 --> 11:53.880]  I'm thinking Trump's gonna have a press conference in a week or so with all these beauty pageant
[11:53.880 --> 11:59.760]  contestants to say how great he was going back decades ago. Former Ms. Teen slams media
[11:59.760 --> 12:05.760]  witch hunt against Trump. He was an absolute gentleman. And she says the New York Times
[12:05.760 --> 12:13.280]  called her, ABC called her, they contacted her and basically wanted her to talk bad.
[12:13.280 --> 12:16.840]  They wanted Mr. Nebraska. Well, here's what she said. I was contacted today by producer
[12:16.840 --> 12:22.520]  ABC News in New York. She is wanting to question me regarding the Ms. Teen USA allegations.
[12:22.520 --> 12:26.960]  They also let me know that they're reaching out to all my fellow contestants from 97. I'm
[12:26.960 --> 12:31.240]  going to be very truthful. So they find times when he wasn't married and let ABC know that
[12:31.240 --> 12:36.160]  Donald Trump was an absolute gentleman. I never witnessed any inappropriate behavior whatsoever.
[12:36.160 --> 12:40.440]  The entire two weeks I participated the pageant, I am sure that none of my interview will make
[12:40.440 --> 12:44.160]  the news since I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience with Donald.
[12:44.160 --> 12:49.440]  I do find it interesting and important for people to know that these are the depths the
[12:49.440 --> 12:55.080]  media is going to to smear the campaign. Ladies and gentlemen, I have to know people
[12:55.080 --> 12:58.200]  that know Donald Trump very well. I'm gonna stop right there before I ever endorsed him
[12:58.200 --> 13:03.040]  over a year ago. I did deep research on him, including I was worried about the fact that,
[13:03.040 --> 13:07.000]  you know, he's had a couple of lives and, you know, done a lot of the likes of ladies.
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.520]  Was there any weird sex stuff? And they said the guy is extremely straight-lash, doesn't
[13:10.520 --> 13:16.680]  drink, doesn't even take aspirin, hardly goes to the doctor. If anything, he eats like a
[13:16.680 --> 13:23.160]  pig. And the word is, I mean, he eats like two 30 ounce rib-eyes a night, hamburgers,
[13:23.160 --> 13:27.720]  cheeseburgers, sits there in his home theater just throwing popcorn at his face when he's
[13:27.720 --> 13:31.760]  by himself. I mean, I'm just gonna be honest, you wanna know the dirt, that's it. And he's
[13:31.760 --> 13:36.440]  a one-woman guy, but if something goes wrong, he then boom, gets divorced or whatever, gets
[13:36.440 --> 13:40.840]  rid of the girlfriend and gets rid of the girlfriend. Treats women ridiculously nice,
[13:40.840 --> 13:44.160]  chickeningly nice, to the point they can't even hardly stand it, because a lot of women
[13:44.160 --> 13:48.520]  don't be treated too nice. I mean, look at the women around Trump, they're on pedestals.
[13:48.520 --> 13:54.840]  So you want the dirt on Trump? He's just like me, he eats like a pig. Okay, that's it.
[13:54.840 --> 14:00.000]  It's the red blooded American. And I've even reached out to former models that I know he
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.640]  dated. And I'm thinking about getting some of them on the show just because it's just
[14:05.640 --> 14:11.760]  no, Donald Trump was ridiculously nice to me. That's it. So it's all lies, but they're
[14:11.760 --> 14:16.600]  going to talk to thousands of women, and they're going to find people that want money or that
[14:16.600 --> 14:21.360]  have got an ax to grind or Democrats to think they're on some holy jihad against Trump,
[14:21.360 --> 14:24.920]  so they can come out and set him up. But it's not working because people see through it.
[14:24.920 --> 14:29.320]  They know Bill Clinton's a creepy monster. They know Hillary's creepy. The people around
[14:29.320 --> 14:34.520]  her can't stand it. I'm getting into big news here in a moment that's even bigger than
[14:34.520 --> 14:37.760]  this, but I want to just give you the basics today, because I know you already know this.
[14:37.760 --> 14:41.160]  We've got to get these messages out to everyone. I'm going to put together some very well produced
[14:41.160 --> 14:48.280]  reports codifying all this of how they're pulling out the stops on the rigging. But of course,
[14:48.280 --> 14:51.520]  the media's acting like Trump's crazy for saying the sun came up this morning. Here's
[14:51.520 --> 14:56.800]  CNBC. Donald Trump to claim Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim behind New York Times sex assault
[14:56.800 --> 15:03.360]  stories sex. Now there's sex assault stories claiming he would shake a young woman's hand
[15:03.360 --> 15:11.520]  and then smile at him on an elevator. Bill Clinton settling rape cases is not an issue.
[15:11.520 --> 15:14.800]  And all these women lined up saying he raped and the rest of it and Bill Clinton's known
[15:14.800 --> 15:20.000]  for landering. That's not an issue. They're calling it assault when he says the women throw
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.360]  themselves that you could do anything, including grabbing them, you know, because the woman's
[15:23.360 --> 15:27.040]  jumping on you. I mean, that's what mammals do. They grab you, you grab them. The point
[15:27.040 --> 15:34.280]  is they're, they're making normal human activity illegal. They're implying it. This is what
[15:34.280 --> 15:38.160]  they do. Don't use mother and father. You know, when you're enrolling your elementary
[15:38.160 --> 15:41.560]  school student, someone might not have mother and father. They're, they're, they're banning
[15:41.560 --> 15:48.000]  all these terms. The New York Times attacked me yesterday in a big, huge cover story saying
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.400]  Jones believes there's a plot to break up the family. It's in the WikiLeaks. It's, it's
[15:52.400 --> 15:58.760]  in the college doctrine. It's what's taught. The family is seen as an institution that's
[15:58.760 --> 16:04.320]  a threat against government and corporate monopoly of control of the culture. Just like
[16:04.320 --> 16:08.160]  you said, Obamacare was free or you could keep your doctor and you laugh at us. People
[16:08.160 --> 16:12.240]  know it's not free. They know you can't keep your doctor. They know it's meant to bankrupt
[16:12.240 --> 16:16.800]  the system and bring in a single payer. They know you're liars and that's why you're in
[16:16.800 --> 16:20.960]  so much trouble and they're throwing everything they can against Trump right now. So getting
[16:20.960 --> 16:29.320]  back to these numbers, that's the best numbers they've got is interested in Trump and Pussy
[16:29.320 --> 16:39.520]  Gait. And so all they can do here is try to deceive the public that that's actually the
[16:39.520 --> 16:44.200]  number one issue and have this big, big hoax where, oh my gosh, it's the end of Trump by
[16:44.200 --> 16:47.880]  30 Republicans, many of which already said that we're voting for Hillary and who are
[16:47.880 --> 16:54.480]  openly, you know, globalists have come out against him. Thank God, what an endorsement.
[16:54.480 --> 16:59.280]  But internally, the recordings have come out. New ones are out today. She said it publicly
[16:59.280 --> 17:04.000]  but we subscribe to Hillary's emails that she sends to Democrats and we covered this
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.920]  last week. She says we're in trouble. Trump has a dangerous advantage in battleground
[17:07.920 --> 17:14.320]  states. He is kicking our butt. Now, that's what she says privately. Publicly, she says
[17:14.320 --> 17:18.280]  she's winning just like the WikiLeaks say, don't worry, I'm going to say I'm against
[17:18.280 --> 17:22.320]  TPP even though I helped write it and set it up over a decade. I'm very, very proud
[17:22.320 --> 17:26.680]  of it. We're going to get it done, but I need to win this election. That's in the WikiLeaks.
[17:26.680 --> 17:34.120]  Full deception, but Podesta, her chief of staff comes out and spins it all like, well,
[17:34.120 --> 17:44.040]  you know, Donald Trump is connected to WikiLeaks. So ignore him even though they're real. No,
[17:44.040 --> 17:48.600]  he said openly, please release them, of course, but implying that somehow because he's asking
[17:48.600 --> 17:52.520]  for it, the public wants it, that it's his fault. This is the upside down world they
[17:52.520 --> 17:59.280]  live in. But here's Trump saying corporate media is Clinton's most powerful weapon,
[17:59.280 --> 18:03.600]  no longer involved in journalism. That's right. It's extinct basically. It's extinct
[18:03.600 --> 18:08.280]  on mainstream media, including Fox News, except for Sean Hannity and Fox and Friends. That's
[18:08.280 --> 18:13.840]  it. It's the takeover. And if Fox falls completely, you know the whole enchilada has fallen.
[18:13.840 --> 18:19.720]  So let's play that Trump clip. Powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate
[18:19.720 --> 18:35.800]  media, the press. Let's be clear on one thing. The corporate media in our country is no longer
[18:35.800 --> 18:44.560]  involved in journalism. They're a political, special interest, no different than any lobbyist
[18:44.560 --> 18:52.360]  or other financial entity with a total political agenda. And the agenda is not for you. It's
[18:52.360 --> 19:07.240]  for themselves. And their agenda is to elect Crook and Hillary Clinton at any cost, at
[19:07.240 --> 19:19.440]  any price, no matter how many lives they destroy. For them, it's a war. And for them, nothing
[19:19.440 --> 19:29.760]  at all is out of bounds. This is a struggle for the survival of our nation, believe me.
[19:29.760 --> 19:35.480]  And this will be our last chance to save it on November 8th. Remember that.
[19:35.480 --> 19:39.200]  There has never been since the days of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington such truth
[19:39.200 --> 19:43.160]  being spoken. The mainstream media will not show him when he says that Hillary's a communist
[19:43.160 --> 19:47.880]  Chinese agent and then gives the evidence. He won't show it whenever he exposes Carlos
[19:47.880 --> 19:53.400]  Slim being a Mexican kingpin, one of the richest men in the world involved in just all sorts
[19:53.400 --> 19:58.520]  of chicanery owning the New York Times. They won't show it until now because they're going
[19:58.520 --> 20:02.880]  to try to push it like, oh, look, he doesn't like Mexicans. Well, I don't think Mexicans
[20:02.880 --> 20:07.760]  would like, say, an American company owning their biggest newspaper and trying to get
[20:07.760 --> 20:14.320]  involved in their elections. Plus, Carlos Slim is not even a Mexican. Let's get that
[20:14.320 --> 20:19.920]  straight. He's from the Middle East. He's an Arab. Nothing against Arabs. I just want
[20:19.920 --> 20:23.760]  everybody to know the reason they call him Carlos Slim is he's not a Mexican. So we got
[20:23.760 --> 20:28.560]  a guy saying he's a Mexican involved in our elections down there running Mexico. And let
[20:28.560 --> 20:37.680]  me tell you, it takes a lot of juice to run Mexico. It takes a lot of juice to run Mexico.
[20:37.680 --> 20:48.360]  He is the LFA. By the way, he makes billions and billions. Last time I checked it was almost
[20:48.360 --> 20:54.120]  three billion off U.S. taxpayers in the last seven, eight years off of Obama phone. He
[20:54.120 --> 21:01.160]  is the sole provider of Obama phone. No wonder he's so rich and can prop up the New York
[21:01.160 --> 21:10.480]  Times with upwards of $200 million a year. He reportedly puts into that that failed joke.
[21:10.480 --> 21:15.840]  That burnout husk. I mean, think about that. I'm digressing here, but we got the communist
[21:15.840 --> 21:22.000]  Chinese, the corrupt pope, the out of control Saudi Arabians that, you know, murder women
[21:22.000 --> 21:27.480]  and kill gays and everything else you can imagine for no reason. Stone women to death.
[21:27.480 --> 21:32.120]  All of this, this, this motley crew, this legion of doom, all these corrupt multinational
[21:32.120 --> 21:36.280]  corporations, all the emails admitting they're robbing us blind, laughing at us behind the
[21:36.280 --> 21:42.440]  scenes, saying we want to shut down the free press and arrest journalists doing it at a
[21:42.440 --> 21:48.880]  level never seen by any president in history. Hillary says she's going to make it much worse.
[21:48.880 --> 21:54.840]  You got a bunch of weird out of work or underemployed wannabe intellectuals that get their news
[21:54.840 --> 22:01.440]  from the Daily Show and MSNBC who really believe Hillary's about to win this election. No,
[22:01.440 --> 22:09.080]  she's about to steal it. And here's a clip of Hillary telling Ellen worried about voter
[22:09.080 --> 22:13.920]  turnout. That's right. And we have the head of New York elections admitting on video.
[22:13.920 --> 22:20.640]  We got to cue that back up later that they are already busing people around to precinct
[22:20.640 --> 22:25.480]  after precinct to vote over and over again and that no IDs are allowed so they can engage
[22:25.480 --> 22:31.160]  in the fraud on video in the newspapers. Nobody. And it's happening in Florida. It's happening
[22:31.160 --> 22:35.840]  everywhere and they're still worried because here's the deal. Most Democrats I talked to
[22:35.840 --> 22:42.400]  the head of the green party has come out and said we must be against. I just got chills.
[22:42.400 --> 22:46.960]  I really got chills. We must vote for Trump because Hillary's going to start World War
[22:46.960 --> 22:52.920]  III. I played last week folks the clip and I'm played again where Hillary said she's
[22:52.920 --> 22:57.600]  going to start a war with Russia. And then if they think there's any cyber attacks from
[22:57.600 --> 23:01.780]  Russia or from the Russian territory, globalists could go over there and launch a hack attack
[23:01.780 --> 23:06.600]  from say Moscow in some hotel room. Blame it on Russia and she says she will use physical
[23:06.600 --> 23:11.240]  force against him. She is crazy. Russia's moving missiles up to their border now for
[23:11.240 --> 23:19.120]  the first time since the end of the Cold War. And now the head of the green party has come
[23:19.120 --> 23:24.080]  out Jill Stein and says Donald Trump is better. Close quote. Hillary more likely to start
[23:24.080 --> 23:30.000]  nuclear war. Is there any basic intellectualism left in so-called leftist because this is
[23:30.000 --> 23:35.360]  as leftist as you get the old fashioned left that I disagreed with on some issues but had
[23:35.360 --> 23:40.080]  a lot of moral high ground. You people are not liberals. I want to explain that to you
[23:40.080 --> 23:43.960]  very succinctly. Notice I'm not talking to the listeners very much anymore because you
[23:43.960 --> 23:47.960]  guys get it okay. You guys get it. We need to get the word out to these people and say
[23:47.960 --> 23:55.680]  do you understand Hillary is a psychotic demon. Julian Assange calls her a demon that wants
[23:55.680 --> 24:01.280]  to quote put our heads in a noose collectively. Close quote. Jill Stein very accomplished
[24:01.280 --> 24:06.720]  liberal but a good record of being very fair and actually standing up for working people
[24:06.720 --> 24:10.920]  disagree with the philosophy makes people dependent but her form of socialism is a lot better
[24:10.920 --> 24:14.560]  than corporate fascism. I'll tell you right now. Gonna have health care for free make
[24:14.560 --> 24:20.840]  it free. Don't make it cost five times more and rape everybody for offshore corporations.
[24:20.840 --> 24:25.000]  Only thing works is socialism and communism is corporate fascism and we're sitting here
[24:25.000 --> 24:30.160]  looking at it. You got Julian Assange saying she's a demon wants to start World War three.
[24:30.160 --> 24:33.600]  You got Jill Stein saying she's wants to start World War three. You've got the Russian
[24:33.600 --> 24:38.160]  president warning. You've got all the top defense experts including conservatives and
[24:38.160 --> 24:42.440]  people who have studied the Cold War and war coming out on C-SPAN and saying what is this
[24:42.440 --> 24:52.320]  the new McCarthyism. So I don't know how to get through to you but she doesn't represent
[24:52.320 --> 24:56.040]  you. You think you're gonna get power get some more goodies. Black people voted for
[24:56.040 --> 25:01.480]  Obama and record numbers. What they got was double unemployment. You go why because the
[25:01.480 --> 25:07.360]  globalist once they got you and once a pimps got you they want to break you down. Once
[25:07.360 --> 25:11.560]  they got you addicted to drugs and ten guys on you a day or whatever you're lucky if you
[25:11.560 --> 25:17.840]  get a bucket of fried chicken. Like on that pimp show I'm interviewing real pimps you
[25:17.840 --> 25:21.800]  learn a lot from them from the establishment and she's been in a car wreck or run over
[25:21.800 --> 25:25.360]  whatever the pimps in there. She's like baby I'm gonna get up I'm gonna get back on street
[25:25.360 --> 25:30.640]  for you baby I'm so sorry and her mother says what did you do to my baby and they're interviewing
[25:30.640 --> 25:36.600]  the pimp. What do you give her? Like how much do you pay her or the money she raises. She
[25:36.600 --> 25:43.760]  goes I don't pay her anything. She's lucky I feed her. That's how Obama and the New
[25:43.760 --> 25:47.440]  World Order are. She goes to Africa and he says you can't have development. You can't
[25:47.440 --> 25:52.920]  have cars you can't have air condition. They're like alright you're black we're for it. Actually
[25:52.920 --> 25:59.080]  they're not the Africans get it. This is an epic time to be alive folks. Hillary is plunging
[25:59.080 --> 26:04.040]  in every metric. Every real metric. Every big corporate bot out there goes actually
[26:04.040 --> 26:09.120]  we're getting 12 to 1, 20 something to 1, 40 something to 1. I mean the lowest numbers
[26:09.120 --> 26:17.800]  are way above 10. 12, 13% in all the algorithms. Some algorithms have Trump hundreds of times
[26:17.800 --> 26:20.960]  more popular than Hillary. I can't even believe these numbers they're so incredible. I mean
[26:20.960 --> 26:25.000]  we're talking mega whopping landsline and that's why they're panicking. Here's another
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.680]  metric. AP study I talked about so much from 3 months ago. 6% trust rate nationally. Thousands
[26:30.680 --> 26:37.080]  and thousands surveyed personally in a real poll. Say they have 6% trust in MSM. It's
[26:37.080 --> 26:42.960]  about that in Congress about 9%. Of course Hillary doesn't have support. Remember during
[26:42.960 --> 26:49.000]  the primaries at first she was getting like 10% national polls. Jeb was getting 3-4%.
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.720]  These people vacation together. Nobody wanted them. It's a total hoax and all they're trying
[26:54.720 --> 27:02.080]  to do is shell you on the hoax that she really wins. Now they're having trouble stealing these
[27:02.080 --> 27:10.080]  battleground states and most metrics come up to I'm going from memory but it's 268. I'm
[27:10.080 --> 27:13.240]  going from memory here but you have to split. If you split the delegates in the battleground
[27:13.240 --> 27:17.560]  states it keeps coming up tied. It's what a lot of their models show even though they're
[27:17.560 --> 27:25.080]  able to steal a few states tied. Well then you're going to have nine justices and if
[27:25.080 --> 27:34.120]  you've got four Republican or Democrat it's deadlocked. It's deadlocked. But Scalia was
[27:34.120 --> 27:43.800]  going to be there just like in 2000 and so Scalia had to go and what do I have here now?
[27:43.800 --> 27:55.000]  What do I have here? What's in WikiLeaks? Wetworks. Podesta email makes assassination
[27:55.000 --> 28:02.240]  reference day before Scalia's death and they go on to say yeah we're going ahead with it
[28:02.240 --> 28:05.760]  and he's talking to one of the other top officials and he says alright get ready this is going
[28:05.760 --> 28:13.360]  to be really rough batting down the hatches. Now and you read it what's clearly happening
[28:13.360 --> 28:17.480]  is they're having a big meeting out at Martha's Vineyard where a lot of the big decisions
[28:17.480 --> 28:22.000]  get made and he's emailing back and forth and he goes alright so we're going to have
[28:22.000 --> 28:26.160]  Wetworks. Didn't know that was going on at pool parties alright getting ready to batten
[28:26.160 --> 28:28.560]  down the hatch this is going to get rough. I'm going to come back and cover this the
[28:28.560 --> 28:33.560]  next segment but let me get to the next clip because I mentioned it but here it is. They
[28:33.560 --> 28:37.840]  know Trump's way ahead by every metric except their fake polls where they sample double
[28:37.840 --> 28:41.800]  you know write down to seven to ten to twelve to fourteen percent but some of them are double
[28:41.800 --> 28:45.520]  or more where they sample more Democrats than Republicans. I mean how dumb do they think
[28:45.520 --> 28:50.640]  you are then of course he's ahead there. I mean it's totally rigged a five year old
[28:50.640 --> 28:55.920]  could figure this out a three year old but they want that illusion so here's Hillary
[28:55.920 --> 29:00.960]  worried about voter turnout. I don't want anybody to think this election's over because
[29:00.960 --> 29:05.760]  it's been so unpredictable up till now that I'm not taking anything for granted we've
[29:05.760 --> 29:11.760]  got to work really hard for the next three and a half weeks because who knows who knows
[29:11.760 --> 29:17.880]  what can happen and so everybody who's watching and everybody who has followed this election
[29:17.880 --> 29:22.440]  please turn out and vote. And of course as they're doing in New York and Florida vote
[29:22.440 --> 29:27.520]  many times on the Democrat buses on the old move on dot org buses just ride from spot
[29:27.520 --> 29:31.640]  to spot nice Democrats run the computer come on in no ID needed just get right in here
[29:31.640 --> 29:37.200]  you already voted ten times a day go right up there and vote again. And in what six seven
[29:37.200 --> 29:42.160]  states the Democrats almost passed bills to let illegals from China Russia Mexico you
[29:42.160 --> 29:47.280]  name it vote the day they're here you get in you can vote the overthrow of the country
[29:47.280 --> 29:53.240]  is what you're witnessing. We're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[29:53.240 --> 30:01.600]  GCN radio network. We're read on election day perhaps the biggest election in America
[30:01.600 --> 30:05.720]  American history is just days away we know that in past elections there have been thousands
[30:05.720 --> 30:10.000]  of cases of voter fraud and election fraud from dead people voting to people registering
[30:10.000 --> 30:14.440]  false identifications to government leaders providing fast track amnesty to give illegal
[30:14.440 --> 30:18.480]  immigrants votes this is happening right in front of us now we are seeing the establishment
[30:18.480 --> 30:22.840]  send all its hitmen after the Republican nominee Donald Trump government chills are campaigning
[30:22.840 --> 30:27.480]  for Clinton mainstream news attacking Donald Trump all day like rabbit hounds rigged polls
[30:27.480 --> 30:31.760]  being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics that Hillary Clinton is actually winning
[30:31.760 --> 30:35.560]  and to discourage people from voting Trump fake celebrities endorsing Clinton across
[30:35.560 --> 30:39.960]  all platforms so with all this what are we doing to keep this election from being stolen
[30:39.960 --> 30:43.840]  what can we do to prevent election fraud I propose that all Donald Trump supporters
[30:43.840 --> 30:47.920]  wear red on election day on November 8 when you head to the polls to vote Donald Trump
[30:47.920 --> 30:52.760]  be decked out in red this way just as we dominated in rally turnout we can prove and provide the

[34:04.880 --> 34:12.960]  coming storm the same guy is accusing trump ally roger stone fox news is covering it of
[34:12.960 --> 34:17.000]  colluding with wiki league so we've seen congress have these hearings all stone did was through
[34:17.000 --> 34:23.760]  an intermediary talk to assange about when stuff was coming out and and assange has been
[34:23.760 --> 34:28.240]  talking to tons of media but again they imply like we're three year olds that they're the
[34:28.240 --> 34:36.600]  authority figure and oops i caught you breathing air oops i caught you saying you're heterosexual
[34:36.600 --> 34:42.160]  or saying mother or father or you're a first grader you asked for brownies at lunch so
[34:42.160 --> 34:46.240]  they called the police to interview you just to let you know that we can say you're all
[34:46.240 --> 34:52.520]  under suspicion because you might have met a black person asking for a brownie i want
[34:52.520 --> 34:59.360]  a brownie in the school lunch line i like brownies here come the police that was in
[34:59.360 --> 35:04.440]  the news in fact oh well those are just little side issues no they're not it's the plan the
[35:04.440 --> 35:09.760]  total takeover of language scorched earth dumbing everyone down it's in the wiki leagues that
[35:09.760 --> 35:13.760]  came out last week where they said we want to dumb down unconscious population but i
[35:13.760 --> 35:22.720]  have them all on tv admitting that they're lying to us i mean charlie rose laughing
[35:22.720 --> 35:29.880]  about it jonathan gruber laughing about it robert gibbs laughing about it azika limanuel
[35:29.880 --> 35:38.680]  laughing about it because in their psychology they love to rub it in dishonorable people
[35:38.680 --> 35:46.440]  do that an honorable person doesn't even rub in a righteous victory i'm guilty when i have
[35:46.440 --> 35:50.440]  to crush evil people i just don't like crushing my fellow humans but it has to be done to
[35:50.440 --> 35:54.920]  protect the innocent these people enjoy it they're rebelling it because they are degenerate
[35:54.920 --> 36:00.080]  trash and oh they've got the paramilitaries and they've got the mafias and they've got
[36:00.080 --> 36:06.200]  the hit teams and they've got the drones and they've been hijacked the west system these
[36:06.200 --> 36:11.960]  miscreants who who just did bill clinton's first inauguration in 1993 number it was famous
[36:11.960 --> 36:16.280]  it was in the news it was in front of the press ron silver a hollywood producer also
[36:16.280 --> 36:23.240]  actor he's in diehard the first one he plays the bad guy this is how disconnected mentally
[36:23.240 --> 36:26.920]  ill these people are because they're real smart when it comes to criminality and and and and
[36:26.920 --> 36:31.560]  manipulation deceiving dumb people but when it comes to how things work or history they're
[36:31.560 --> 36:35.280]  so intellectually lazy they have no grasp of it they're always real arrogant about other
[36:35.280 --> 36:42.640]  famous people or other great patriots or no it's all about them okay and so f-16s fly
[36:42.640 --> 36:49.840]  over this is famous and he goes how dare they the military hates us and hillary says mr silver
[36:49.840 --> 36:59.520]  ron it's our military now i knew about this a few years ago but i didn't even tell the
[36:59.520 --> 37:04.520]  story because it sounded so crazy because it was in newspapers in europe and things at
[37:04.520 --> 37:10.480]  the time but will you guys pull up the new crown prince of uh thailand place you get arrested
[37:10.480 --> 37:17.000]  in thailand if you even mildly criticize the monarchy but our media always calls it a free
[37:17.000 --> 37:29.680]  country even though it's not but the new crown prince has gone too far and basically
[37:29.680 --> 37:35.840]  this is very effeminately i'll just leave it to you at that and they're turning against
[37:35.840 --> 37:42.640]  him but guess why they really turned against him he made his girlfriend's poodle the head
[37:42.640 --> 37:49.480]  of the air force now now understand something this is something they always do in the last
[37:49.480 --> 37:53.760]  phases of insanity they they they want to get caught they want to get removed from power
[37:53.760 --> 37:59.240]  to subconscious level hillary and others going on tv saying how much they had americans how
[37:59.240 --> 38:05.000]  much they hate baristas and and and bernie supporting basement dwellers and telling what
[38:05.000 --> 38:11.320]  they really think of you they enter the last phase they always make their horse or their
[38:11.320 --> 38:19.920]  dog head of the roman senate or head of the air force or such things then they usually
[38:19.920 --> 38:26.000]  blow up part of the capital or slit their wrist one of the media i don't know why they do it
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.960]  it's in their psychology you're giving everything generation after generation like kim jung
[38:30.960 --> 38:38.240]  on that's a communist hereditary dictatorship but then you also have right wing fascist
[38:38.240 --> 38:44.880]  ones like the hereditary dictatorship they call royalty in thailand and by the way if
[38:44.880 --> 38:47.960]  you ever want to go to thailand they say don't ever talk about even as a westerner they will
[38:47.960 --> 38:53.200]  lock your butt up well i have no desire to go to thailand here it's got some nice beaches
[38:53.200 --> 38:58.760]  but i don't you know i have the same taste of uh you know bill clinton and people that
[38:58.760 --> 39:04.720]  fly around on the leader express for children but i just put mainstream news articles on
[39:04.720 --> 39:07.680]  screen of him making the poodle the head of the air force let's let's put it back on
[39:07.680 --> 39:12.560]  screen for radio listeners i'm going to read the headlines and the reason i go there is
[39:12.560 --> 39:17.720]  these people are disconnected i mean ron silver really thought f-16s were flying over because
[39:17.720 --> 39:21.720]  they were mad at bill clinton becoming president they were so disconnected how the military
[39:21.720 --> 39:26.360]  works how the country works what what military parades are they were so disdainful that he
[39:26.360 --> 39:34.400]  was literally they're like don't worry those are our aircraft now ron this is who rules
[39:34.400 --> 39:39.040]  us people that are so dumb they don't know the new inaugurated president gets military
[39:39.040 --> 39:45.760]  flyovers it's like congress when they're sitting there talking to the chairman of the joint
[39:45.760 --> 39:51.080]  chiefs dumford two weeks ago and he's going but if we fire missiles and they're not man
[39:51.080 --> 39:55.000]  then we take out the airfields and aircraft no one will die but the russians they'll teach
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.480]  them a lesson correct and the general goes yes but then they'll respond to our bases
[39:59.480 --> 40:04.760]  nearby where we're we're our man that'll be an act of war and they just come back and
[40:04.760 --> 40:11.000]  they go but we're going to use missiles so nobody gets hurt they don't even understand
[40:11.000 --> 40:18.720]  doctrine that then you hit some of the missiles they fire unmanned missiles at you s 300 s
[40:18.720 --> 40:24.800]  400s and so on that will take out aircraft carriers just like that cannot be stopped
[40:24.800 --> 40:30.040]  just you know world war three like when the aircraft carriers get hit the united states
[40:30.040 --> 40:35.000]  is going to launch missiles cruise missiles in and nuclear war starts and but congress
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.480]  republicans democrats they just keep week after week you can watch these series going
[40:39.480 --> 40:44.880]  I want you to get tough on the russians boy I want you to hit them well we're going to
[40:44.880 --> 40:47.360]  need a declaration of war for that or the for the president to call for us to strike
[40:47.360 --> 40:52.920]  Russia we're prepared to right now we're prepared to launch war with Russia and right now just
[40:52.920 --> 40:57.800]  give us the order we'll follow orders but they're so disconnected in congress about not taking
[40:57.800 --> 41:07.120]  responsibility they go you don't do it you're gonna take responsibility I mean I'm not exaggerating
[41:07.120 --> 41:11.920]  and of course there's a level dumber than that I talked about last week and that's I'm
[41:11.920 --> 41:18.480]  really concerned ahead of the navy if we put 8000 more marines on Guam won't the island
[41:18.480 --> 41:23.600]  tip over and he was serious he thought again I already thought I got so much to discover
[41:23.600 --> 41:29.080]  but I'm saying fundamentally folks we think of the people running washington is super
[41:29.080 --> 41:32.720]  smart and there are some evil people behind them and are but they put all these idiots
[41:32.720 --> 41:40.160]  in so they won't ask questions that are dangerous so before I get into the wet work story that's
[41:40.160 --> 41:46.040]  so huge let's play this clip of Jill Stein since I mentioned it the head of the green
[41:46.040 --> 41:51.300]  party the democrats ridicule and demonize all the rest of it because you know she's not
[41:51.300 --> 41:57.360]  playing ball with them she's not a fake leftist like like like Bernie Sanders she says Donald
[41:57.360 --> 42:03.280]  Trump is better Hillary more likely to start nuclear war absolutely just that issue alone
[42:03.280 --> 42:07.880]  as I've said over and over again and they have the nerve to run TV ads that mimic the
[42:07.880 --> 42:15.080]  1963-64 election where Barry Goldwater who didn't want war they have the countdown with
[42:15.080 --> 42:22.560]  little girl with a daisy and as she pulls each piece off 10 9 8 7 6 boom hydrogen bomb
[42:22.560 --> 42:32.120]  goes off on zero but with Hillary that's really what's going on this is a biblical thing
[42:32.120 --> 42:37.880]  that's happening right now let's play the clip wing extremism grows out of the policies
[42:37.880 --> 42:43.880]  of the Clintons in particular NAFTA which sent our jobs overseas and wall street deregulation
[42:43.880 --> 42:50.440]  which blew 9 million jobs up into smoke so that's what's creating this right wing extremism
[42:50.440 --> 42:55.520]  a vote for Hillary Clinton isn't going to fix it and one last point which is this that
[42:55.520 --> 43:02.320]  it's now Hillary Clinton who wants to start an air war with Russia over Syria by calling
[43:02.320 --> 43:08.320]  for a no-fly zone we have 2000 nuclear missiles on hair trigger alert and Mikhail Gorbachev
[43:08.320 --> 43:13.160]  the former premier of the Soviet Union is saying we are closer to a nuclear war than
[43:13.160 --> 43:19.040]  we have ever been under Hillary Clinton we could slide into nuclear war very quickly
[43:19.040 --> 43:24.880]  from her declared policy in Syria so I won't sleep well at night if Donald Trump is elected
[43:24.880 --> 43:30.000]  but I sure won't sleep well at night if Hillary Clinton is elected fortunately we have another
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.920]  choice other than these two candidates who are both promoting lethal policies but on
[43:34.920 --> 43:40.440]  the issue of war and nuclear weapons and the potential for nuclear war is actually Hillary's
[43:40.440 --> 43:46.640]  policies which are much scarier than Donald Trump who does not want to go to war with
[43:46.640 --> 43:54.080]  Russia he wants to seek modes of working together which is the ladies and gentlemen
[43:54.080 --> 44:04.320]  I am seriously concerned about nuclear war so is everyone else who thinks meanwhile we
[44:04.320 --> 44:09.880]  have been so domesticated so separated from the land so separated from cause and effect
[44:09.880 --> 44:16.000]  so separated from reality the average person that this isn't even an issue in this country
[44:16.000 --> 44:26.680]  now and we have the New York Times coming out this weekend today with this article
[44:26.680 --> 44:32.040]  Donald Trump slipping in polls warns of stolen election meanwhile I have the head of New
[44:32.040 --> 44:36.840]  York election board who's a Democrat saying they're already stealing it with early voting
[44:36.840 --> 44:46.680]  driving a bunch of people around voting over and over again standard operating procedure
[44:46.680 --> 44:52.080]  so their response is to say he's a total cook as if no one has any memory of two months
[44:52.080 --> 44:58.320]  ago when I came out and said emergency alert emergency message to Donald Trump they stole
[44:58.320 --> 45:01.920]  the nomination from Sanders they tried to steal it from you the Republicans are going
[45:01.920 --> 45:05.320]  to double cross you a month out from the election they're going to try to create the illusion
[45:05.320 --> 45:08.440]  that you really lost you understand this and know this you must get out ahead of it now
[45:08.440 --> 45:13.520]  and expose election fraud and yes then I told him that personally in lengthy discussions
[45:13.520 --> 45:17.520]  and I didn't tell him something he didn't know he concurred everything I said because
[45:17.520 --> 45:22.600]  it was the truth and of course he had some advisors killing that'll make it look like
[45:22.600 --> 45:26.280]  you're being a sore loser even though you're ahead no no don't do that no he needs to do
[45:26.280 --> 45:33.920]  it and then he was proven right because it forced Obama to say there's no such thing
[45:33.920 --> 45:40.880]  as election fraud what is that I don't smell like a devil demon with Alex Jones it was
[45:40.880 --> 45:49.600]  it was again I totally trolled them again so I could then get attention on Julian Assange
[45:49.600 --> 45:54.760]  and Bill Clinton everybody else saying Hillary's a demon these people are so easy to troll
[45:54.760 --> 46:00.600]  because again on average they think when F-16s fly over it's the enemy I mean the average
[46:00.600 --> 46:05.840]  person even that's mid-level you can't really do anything but be like middle school where
[46:05.840 --> 46:10.520]  they act real sullen and bossy and have the right shoes and the right suit on and drive
[46:10.520 --> 46:16.320]  the right BMW I'm not bashing you have a BMW I'm just saying they're husk they're just
[46:16.320 --> 46:20.400]  a bunch of followers who sit around their email so confident we're about to make you
[46:20.400 --> 46:24.120]  run a major op okay better batten down the hashes wow I didn't know you were setting
[46:24.120 --> 46:31.240]  up wet work and you know at Martha's Vineyard and the next day Scalia's dead I mean you
[46:31.240 --> 46:39.640]  know you don't talk about that on email but see you're so arrogant and I just love all
[46:39.640 --> 46:44.240]  these wimps that want to war with the soldiers who aren't perfect but built this empire that
[46:44.240 --> 46:48.840]  you've hijacked who want to make us the enemy who want to make the patriots that set up
[46:48.840 --> 46:54.280]  this country the enemy picking a fight with the very people you've hijacked that are your
[46:54.280 --> 46:59.640]  slaves right now but you're so angry at the liberty movement that you want to take it
[46:59.640 --> 47:07.000]  over and destroy it to mount it on the wall like you went on some type of safari that's
[47:07.000 --> 47:13.600]  what it comes down to they're just out to get red-blooded Americans of every race color
[47:13.600 --> 47:17.360]  and creed that want to be self-sufficient and macho and strong they don't want it they
[47:17.360 --> 47:22.480]  don't women being women with all that power and running the house and running the kids
[47:22.480 --> 47:29.160]  and running a strong man out there at a whole nine yards mama needs to go to work she does
[47:29.160 --> 47:33.400]  they don't want that they want the government to wear the pants and we're all out there
[47:33.400 --> 47:38.400]  in the slave quarters and boy I covered this all week so I'm not going to get back into
[47:38.400 --> 47:43.080]  it but how many quotes did I have how they want is dumb subservient in our own world
[47:43.080 --> 47:51.280]  stupid and poor they want you poor they want you stupid Donald Trump wants you to be rich
[47:51.280 --> 47:55.280]  he wants prosperity and you can call some Christians could call that worldly you know
[47:55.280 --> 48:04.120]  what he is worldly you really study the devil the devil gets people to sell out for worldly
[48:04.120 --> 48:08.760]  things he doesn't ever give them to you the new world order wants to make you super poor
[48:08.760 --> 48:15.360]  and under their control so they can run your life and there are many cases in history where
[48:15.360 --> 48:20.760]  God sets up people like Trump to bring countries back and societies back from the brink and
[48:20.760 --> 48:26.720]  if we pass up on this folks remember you ask for it and remember you wanted it and remember
[48:26.720 --> 48:31.640]  you accepted it because they're going to try to steal the election right now it's about
[48:31.640 --> 48:36.240]  exposing their planning to do it exposing the Trump's really far ahead and exposing
[48:36.240 --> 48:40.960]  the fact that we're going to have to stand up against it when they try to steal it and
[48:40.960 --> 48:43.960]  we're organizing that right now and they know it and they're pissed because remember there's
[48:43.960 --> 48:47.280]  no such thing as election fraud but we forced them to come in and federalize it all which
[48:47.280 --> 48:56.040]  they were already planning that was a devastating victory but one of the most important things
[48:56.040 --> 49:00.560]  I ever did analyzing the globalist was to realize really smart evil super geniuses set
[49:00.560 --> 49:05.680]  them up a long time ago and set up this system for them and even the elites admit that the
[49:05.680 --> 49:10.640]  ones that have taken it over are not hard working and are just a lot of them two steps
[49:10.640 --> 49:15.040]  above being mentally retarded which makes them more dangerous to start a war we're
[49:15.040 --> 49:19.260]  in greater peril I'm not glad we have elites running things that are a bunch of knuckle
[49:19.260 --> 49:27.280]  drag and snot nose demons there is so much incredible news to cover but that Jill Stein
[49:27.280 --> 49:32.280]  is just over the top we've got to get that out to everybody the top real liberal in the
[49:32.280 --> 49:38.480]  country says Hillary Clinton wants a war because she said it I got the clip she wants a war
[49:38.480 --> 49:43.280]  she said day one is president we're going in and imposing a no fly zone and the Russians
[49:43.280 --> 49:46.760]  have said we've been invited in we're here legally we're not back in radical Islam we're
[49:46.760 --> 49:52.760]  going to fight him they've got us general shooting their mouths off saying get ready
[49:52.760 --> 50:00.040]  for war right now and then meanwhile we've got Podesta this is such a big story from

[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:24.680]  and then they came out and said we're federalizing it to keep it safe from trump his dirty
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:29.240]  tricksters and the evil russkies that are hiding under the table so they're the ones that are
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:33.000]  discredited had a big new york times article on me yesterday saying i'm crazy because i believe
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.040]  an election fraud and that they want our guns well the new wiki leaks shows hillary clinton
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:44.120]  plans to use executive orders to ban all semi autos it's a fact we're right you're wrong you're lying
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:50.280]  to your readers and now we know it is the mexican kingpin carlos slim that owns the new york times
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:55.080]  that is directing all of this against trump calling up every pageant contest he's ever had
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:01.560]  trying to get him to say things and they also want to go out the free press he says she wants to go
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.680]  over the alt right it has no right to exist they want to bring back the fairness doctrine and then
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.800]  they go out for a journalist that's what he's been doing the last 15 years is writing books and
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:17.160]  articles roger stone and podesta has quote implicated trump advisor roger stone over wiki
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:22.520]  leaks email release that's preposterous but it's acting like it's bad as a journalist if you try
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:30.360]  to talk to julien assange he's gone on everything from npr to the new york times to to cnn to
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:37.800]  sean hannity i mean it's crazy but stone obviously has been trying to find out when it's coming out
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:43.160]  but he's told me privately he said on air and it's the truth that he had no idea the fact that
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:47.720]  assange has said it would be damning and get her indicted and now we're seeing it is but it changes
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:53.560]  the subject who cares how it comes out as long as it's authentic but then podesta isn't another
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:59.640]  chilling email that just came out talking about wet work what is it two days before scalia
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:05.080]  is found dead and his counterpart is we got to batten down the hatches and get ready this is
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:11.880]  going to get rough this is a war folks i'm sure when he talks about wet work he means
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:19.160]  maybe working at a zoo with seals or something or or maybe uh power washing you know the sides
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:23.240]  of buildings i'm sure there's no such thing when he's from the pillow over his head and
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:29.640]  no autopsy it was basically a message that he sleeps with the fishes in my humble view this
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:34.440]  should be investigated because we know the clinton's long trail and their minions of death the wars
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:39.560]  the illegal wars why not give her another peace prize you know like they gave obama but first
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:43.240]  this clip because i want to get into this first with roger stone and then into how he's being
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:47.320]  attacked but it all ties together as an attack on the press uh with the head of new york elections
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:51.880]  who i just mentioned admitting that they're buzzing people around there is election official caught
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:57.960]  on video blasting the blazio's id program and he's a democrat he admits it's wrong people can vote over
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:02.280]  and over and over again but only other democrats here it is i think there's a lot of overlap
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:08.120]  right like i say people don't realize certain neighborhoods in particular
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:15.480]  they bust people around to vote they do what they bust them around they put them in a bus
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:23.240]  they move the whole site the whole site like what kind of neighborhoods oh i don't want to say
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:31.320]  commissioner of new york elections oh like minority neighborhoods like black neighborhoods
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:38.760]  and hispanic neighborhoods and chinese too oh why do they why do they do that just to get like
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:46.040]  more votes for democrats or more running for office oh yeah for like their candidates for
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:13:00.520]  stop right there he goes on to say it's wrong to his credit roger stone uh joins us to break all
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:05.160]  this down hillary play the clip earlier admits that they are uh really worried about people
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:10.200]  getting out to vote that she internally thinks she's in trouble roger and then i also want to go
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:16.360]  into jill stein saying basically vote donald trump because hillary is uh more likely to
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:21.400]  start a nuclear war uh and she's dead on i mean this this is an amazing time to be alive my friend
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:28.360]  yes indeed alice i played that clip on the stone cold truth this morning you have both jill stein
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:35.480]  uh and cindy she and you remember her who camped out outside george w's ranch to protest the
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:42.200]  war in iraq now both saying that donald trump is less dangerous to world peace than hillary
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:48.360]  clinton meanwhile in syria you know we're hurtling towards war barack obama says he'll make decisions
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:55.800]  at the end of next week on his military options uh you know you know in a in a situation in which
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:01.880]  nobody involved is our friend it's really extraordinary uh but the last 24 hours have
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:08.920]  been turned upside down because uh first john pedesta and then last night robbie mook of the
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:18.120]  clinton campaign uh both asserted that i knew about the wiki leaks hacking of john pedesta
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:24.360]  before the fact just to be very clear for everybody that is categorically false
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:31.640]  uh and it's it's uh it's adding two and two and coming up with six the reason they say this is
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:39.400]  because in august you know two different tweets i predicted that um that pedesta's business dealings
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:45.800]  would become problematic i was a little more i was a little more oblique i said oh pedesta's time
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:51.080]  in the barrel will come that wasn't based on anything i learned from going to sondra wiki
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:58.120]  leaks it was based on my own research uh and but it's also been he was involved in 35 million
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:04.600]  dollar deals with the ruskies for uranium i mean he was the go-between man with the don hillary i mean
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:09.480]  well that now don't confuse him with his criminal brother tony
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:16.120]  pedesta who was the uh who was a consultant to that no i'm not i'm not i'm not confusing him i
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:21.480]  know he's the main one but he's been involved he's been involved with hillary yeah well deeply
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:27.000]  bottom line of this he has been laundering russian money for the clinton foundation
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.640]  he has been laundering russian money for the purposes of purchasing uh u.s military tech
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:40.200]  technology uh i have a piece up now at the stone cold truth that documents all of this uh that
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:46.200]  is what i was referring to this piece has taken me some time because some of the original documents
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:51.240]  were in both german and russian it took some time to translate them but and also you've had
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:55.800]  your computers hacked repeatedly and everything erased they're very concerned yeah no look this
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:02.680]  is deflection in other words how do we get people to uh ignore the substance of the emails well you
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:09.080]  know blame the republicans for hacking this is this is part and parcel of the same phony argument
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:15.240]  and that down from that alex jones at roger stone and and my law and the rest of these
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:20.760]  important we all work for the russian when in fact it's hillary who's in bed with the russian
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:25.640]  it's hillary i was about to say i mean i wish this check would arrive at some point yeah exactly
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:30.840]  exactly no so uh it is if the politics of personal destruction and i would have to say
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:38.440]  of the networks only nbc nightly news came and filmed my response which they ran ran the
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:44.840]  nightly news from cnn and fox crickets cricket and again for folks that don't understand the
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:49.560]  history of journalism or being in a free country anytime you get charged with some incredible
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:54.040]  thing you get a response back even if you're an axe murderer now there's no proof they just
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:59.000]  hang you on to dry on every major tv channel in the country uh and then don't let you respond that
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:06.440]  is fascism yeah i know you know to the credit of the print media i i responded to the washington post
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:13.000]  the new york times uh and many many others but it the electronic thing is shocking i've just never
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:21.160]  seen that i understand i'm banned but last week john king attacked me on cnn this week uh i've got
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:29.560]  i've got uh the death certificate simple fairness journalistic ethics require offering me an
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:34.280]  opportunity to respond well as you know and i played the clip last hour trump said all
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:38.600]  journalistic integrity is basically gone by the establishment media and they're basically pushing
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:43.560]  world government globalism let me ask you this now watching how they're behaving what's going on
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:48.120]  they seem to be getting more desperate i know trump according to my own research is ahead
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:53.080]  in a lot of the battleground states uh it appears they're preparing to sell the idea of election
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:59.240]  fraud correct me if i'm wrong what do we do to counter that and then what do we do once they
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:05.240]  actually steal it well i think you and i have both been out front on this in a way that drives
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:10.120]  the establishment politicians crazy because they want us to believe our ballot is sacrosanct and
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:15.640]  that the and that the system will have integrity i take the view of these computerized machines
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:21.160]  can be easily hacked they will be uh but i'm i'm less worried about the russians hacking them and
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:28.200]  more worried about the democratic machine under ram a manual in all honesty they have more experience
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:36.040]  it in election fraud um but this is why i got involved with stop this is dot org we are literally
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:45.000]  shortly hours away from i am told posting our our comprehensive exit poll plan for which we
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:51.240]  have recruited over 500 volunteers so we need manpower we need good men and women who will
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:56.680]  give us their services on election day as volunteers uh that can go for some training
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:03.960]  on how to conduct these exit polls uh but the only hedge you have uh is twofold you could
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:11.080]  examine the the software for the machines before the voting begins and that should be done uh
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:17.320]  and we're going to try to demand it in certain places and then secondarily you have to have a
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:23.640]  scientifically operated exit poll so you can compare them with the actual machine results
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:30.360]  and if the swing is too wide you will know there's fraud i don't think you can just lose the election
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:35.800]  and say well i was defrauded without evidence of fraud but some people say well it would be
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:40.680]  unamerican to challenge the results of the election if you had hard evidence of fraud it
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:45.880]  would be unamerican not to challenge yourself but you must have real evidence that's my view
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:51.240]  stay there my friend i want to come back and talk about what you just mentioned because this is

[01:25:53.800 --> 01:26:00.200]  well we're in wag the dog territory uh this is a war as a pretext for stealing this election
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:07.880]  uh and uh you're right the american people seem to be completely oblivious that we're likely to go
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:15.640]  to war in a conflict in which i can't find any inherent interest of ours nor can i find friends
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:23.320]  on either side i mean a sod is financing hezbollah he's backed up by the russians on the other side
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:29.880]  you have isis backed up by the sorties i think they've moved on 9 11 that they're not friends of ours
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:34.280]  we don't have any friends this is really about what it's about different sex cells
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:41.720]  of islam it's about wahhabism really uh that we would spend a single dollar here or a single
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:48.760]  american life it's just it's astounding how would you sum up roger stown the age and the world we
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:56.280]  live in right now dangerous because the globalists will do anything including starting a world war
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:01.160]  that's what it takes to retain power i know you were talking about private stuff with donald
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:06.120]  trump but uh he seems to be stronger than ever how is he handling these attacks they seem to be
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:12.200]  the polls show these attacks are bouncing off well the end these these uh accusers that the
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:17.320]  new york times has put forward claiming the you know donald trump shoved his uh tongue down
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:22.600]  they were thrown 30 years ago of course they didn't report it then they're just reporting it now
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:27.480]  till he's before election it's already unraveling one of these women has been tied back to the
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:34.280]  clinton library uh before that the clinton foundation this is a this is a you know this is
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:41.240]  a setup this is a fraud uh and a perpetrated i imagined by david brough who went out and recruited
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:47.080]  these women the other headline you'll see is that one of the women kathleen willie uh
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:53.960]  is uh is speaking out against clinton because roger stone paid her mortgage off no i didn't
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:58.280]  i set up a go fund me account and helped raise money to keep her home out of our course our
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:03.080]  listeners did that we did it i love everything everything we do is in secret it's like he once
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:09.640]  went on howard stern it was a secret show no that's public or uh once trump kissed a woman
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:14.360]  all these great evils or or the clinton's you know had her mortgage pulled so we helped her out
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:20.520]  she was already a critic she was already on nbc you know decades ago exposing this exactly and
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:26.520]  look at i i yeah i think i did give a hundred dollars and many many many other people info
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:31.800]  wars listeners included if we raised around 40 grand to keep her house out of i personally
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:35.800]  i remember correctly told him to give a couple thousand my accountant because i give him a
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:40.120]  charity all the time and i'm sad for what happened this woman i interviewed her like 20 years ago
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:45.960]  i mean i know this woman but the media as you know they they twist these things and yes i did
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:53.640]  pay kathy shelton the the woman who was raped at 12 and then assaulted essentially in the courtroom
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:59.960]  by hillary clinton i paid her $2,500 over a boat to sit down with us over two days and
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:04.680]  us video how do you think you get people to take off work that are poor you've got to give them
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:09.240]  the money to come see you but i certainly haven't paid her to change her story because she's been
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:16.120]  saying the same thing that she was 12 years old so it's just on the other hand no one talks about
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:23.560]  how much george soros pays david brach to smear us you know i you may have to go but i'd like to
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:27.880]  put bookends on this can ask you a few more questions and then also make the point i paid
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:31.560]  you know for the hotel for dany williams and bought him lunch does that mean i bought him off no
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:37.000]  he's been saying he's bill clinton's sons his mama told him that you know 25 years ago uh roger
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.240]  stone's our guest stone called truth dot com to give it a nuclear war after we finish up with
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:45.960]  roger stone it's never been more imminent i'm saying this so people get concerned and we
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:52.920]  could not have it happen i got three kids we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:30:02.280]  the gcn radio network we're read on election day perhaps the biggest election in american history
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:06.920]  is just days away we know that in past elections there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:11.480]  and election fraud from dead people voting to people registering false identifications to
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:16.040]  government leaders providing fast track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes this is happening
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:19.800]  right in front of us now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:24.680]  republican nominee donald trump government chills are campaigning for clinton mainstream news attacking
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:29.480]  donald trump all day like rabbit hounds rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:33.880]  optics that hillary clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting trump fake
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:38.680]  celebrities endorsing clinton across all platforms so with all this what are we doing to keep this
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:43.240]  election from being stolen what can we do to prevent election fraud i propose that all donald
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:47.320]  trump supporters wear red on election day on november 8 when you head to the polls to vote
[01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:52.200]  donald trump be decked out in red this way just as we dominated in rally turnout we can prove and
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:56.920]  provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout wear red on election day and make
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:03.560]  america great again we're selling a product dna force that is the very best nutraceutical
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:08.760]  that we can produce about a group you took years for you to develop dna force for us it's been
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:13.800]  something that i've been working on for a long time alex because i think it's very very important
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:19.960]  what the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our telomeres
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:24.920]  telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes but when it runs out you start dying
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:30.920]  we chose the pqq because it has over 175 different clinical trials it's one of the most effective
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:37.560]  substances in the world it works like an antioxidant it works to repair nerve growth factor so this

[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:45.560]  them i'm i'm nonpartisan trump is an outlier a dark horse taking over the party gary johnson
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:50.200]  was the globalist taking over the democratic party in my view but we've got to wear red shirts i'm
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:53.640]  going to come out with a shirt but it'll take about a week and i have to get here and we'll rush

[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:23.960]  a total war we're all in and again that's how desperate it is we're not in there we're not in
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:29.480]  this for our normal capitalist principles we're in this to break the the roadblock being set up by
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:34.120]  the mainstream media on this issue that's right things are so desperate the consummate capitalist
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:37.720]  aren't even trying to make money at this point okay folks because we understand we've got to make
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:41.960]  money to fund ourselves and continue but right now just we're all in so roger the three points you
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:47.320]  wanted to hit finally hey how is trump doing he seems to have gotten a lot hardcore after he got
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:51.240]  set up in the first debate how is he doing am i correct that he seems to be as strong as yet
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:57.240]  well he's liberated because um perhaps some around him that finally figured out that the
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:03.400]  establishment republicans who are at least some of them were temporarily pretending to be his friends
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:10.520]  don't wish him well uh is there he no longer has to defend the the elite republican leadership in
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:16.040]  washington which as you know uh is just as responsible for the lousy conditions the country
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:22.680]  home and abroad as the democrats as the bushes in the clintons and their ilk working together
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:29.320]  brought us to where we are so i think he feels liberated very very exciting you know the media
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:32.360]  tries to spit it that he's a loser because he's fighting with the republicans these are the
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:36.520]  horrible establishment that have been selling us out i wouldn't supporting if the horrible
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:43.640]  rhinos and neocons liking it i mean it's a one yeah roger's got to go here in a moment but roger
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:51.480]  finishing up then with the final point uh we were going to head on yeah i i still think that um the
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:59.800]  greatest danger here as the uh as the as the rotting teetering uh you know two parties duopoly
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:07.560]  uh uh sways in the wind just before collapsing is that they will try to steal the selection so i
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:14.120]  asked people again to go to stop the steel dot org uh join we need your hours we need your manpower
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:20.280]  we need boots on the ground uh because the trump campaign does not have the infrastructure
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:26.760]  necessary to guard these polls uh the republicans are working against us in places like ohio and
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:32.840]  parts of florida and we can only fill these gaps with rank and file patriot citizens who
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:39.160]  want to step forward and try to fight uh what i think is a coming effort to steal this election
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:44.040]  and let's be clear we even if we can't stop it documenting with exit polls with video cameras
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:49.640]  catching fraud if we get center 15 big stories which we'll get if they steal we'll get more it
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:54.200]  will devastate them it will backfire and then there'll be a huge investigation trump will be
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:39:00.680]  catapulted in on the recount if we had scalia he's dead so final question you told me during the break
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:05.640]  that this move to go after carlo slim and the new york times was genius give us 60 seconds on that
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:11.080]  yeah i think there's there's one missing piece of the trump message at carlo slim
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:15.720]  the owner of the new york times the man who has the largest single phone contract with the united
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:22.600]  state government yes is the single biggest contributor to the clinton foundation and the
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:29.320]  clear people of what it is it connects just this is why the new york times is putting up the women
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:36.600]  i've been on who they were supposed to buy our pump but have no proof uh and this is why this has
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:42.440]  been so extraordinarily biased uh in its coverage now i never expected them to be friendly but they
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:50.120]  they've shredded any pretense of objectivity uh and uh slim is uh he's the ultimate globalist
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:57.160]  slim is a mexican billionaire uh paid no taxes the new york times last year just like donald trump
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:03.400]  using the exact same production but you don't read about that on page one it's incredible all right
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:08.600]  roger thank you so much and we'll talk to you again very soon thank you be here alex as always
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:17.000]  victory or death that's right that's what uh colonel travis said at the elmo in 1836
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:27.480]  we sit here today watching all this over the top tyranny and i've told my reporters this
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:30.760]  over and over again not that i need to i told them we don't twist information we don't spend
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:36.520]  that information the truth is what's powerful and we make a mistake on something we come out and we
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:42.600]  admit it and we do sometimes paul made a mistake a few days ago where it looked like hillary said
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:51.160]  you know that she quote hates real americans but if you read it it's kind of double speak it's like
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:57.640]  i know hillary hates to you know talk about real americans and then they said well we
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:03.400]  meant it like she's sick of using that cliche okay i'll take that i'll say that we stretched it
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:09.480]  you know we want to be dead on because see when you start lying to people you lie to yourself when
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:14.440]  you start getting things wrong and they're not correcting it you you you make a mistake you
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:22.920]  turn into a lie when you don't admit it i really want to tell the truth i really want to treat
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:30.520]  people like i want to be treated and i've been telling you this for a couple years
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:42.040]  and now it is absolutely completely and totally out in the open it's naked
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:45.480]  and that is
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:56.040]  russia and the state of russia and the state of the geopolitical machinations and the grand chess
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:02.440]  board a board stratagem of zabigny brzezinski where they lay out their plan i mean it's not
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:05.560]  like i'm just coming up with what they're going to do and then they do it people go wow you're
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:11.080]  really smart they admit 95 of what they're going to do and that's why i'm sitting here in horror as
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:15.960]  they have pentagon military doctrine now saying we can have a survivable nuclear war maybe we
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:22.360]  should just go ahead and have it and then we've got all the moves to stir that up and cause it
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:29.960]  it and now it's gone from being in the russian news and the european news because they're right
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:35.320]  next door to it in our news look at these headlines this and this is out of reuters see
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:40.760]  not alex jones all the big fair monger alex jones huh word for word what i told you a year ago now
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:46.840]  you're looking at it exclusive obama aids expected to waste syria military options today
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:53.480]  including military attacks on russian targets inside syria there's another one in full wars
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:58.200]  dot com great boil demo michael schindler economic collapse world war three barack obama could take
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:04.920]  a major step towards war with russia today nuclear war imminent as russia that's a quote
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:11.720]  tell citizens to find out where the closest bunkers are and as a 40 million person evacuation
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:15.800]  i mentioned that last week there meanwhile don't worry though dutch court upholds hate speech case
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:24.760]  against far right mp who just criticized muslim stabbing people you can't make this up so we've
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:32.680]  got all that we've got donald trump raising 160 plus million dollars for the republicans
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:40.280]  they're supposed to give him half of it for his tv ads they've given him zero they've all run off
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:45.960]  with the money all right trump's supposed to run the r&c they just don't follow the orders and just
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:51.240]  keep the money look at that look at that headline and he goes through all the numbers here
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:44:00.440]  wow i mean you talk about the fix being in this is total criminal fix and trump is just standing
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:05.800]  up the middle of it telling the truth telling it just like it is he's not lying he doesn't exaggerate
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:11.640]  he just it's it's so bizarre to watch one of his speeches and it's basically all true unless he
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:17.400]  talks about codes for iphone's he just doesn't know a lot about technology he's like he got a warrant
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:22.040]  open the door it's it's not bad that they want the back door to everybody's phone and he's wrong
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:26.040]  about torture you know the fact he's so honest though it's like refreshing okay you're wrong
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:32.840]  but on a few things but you're honest they all lie and do it it's just it's so refreshing
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:39.480]  and folks i got invited by the republicans and the democrats before that to work with them i got
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:43.880]  invited to the governor's mansion to the governor it'll be washing tonight when he was running for
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:52.120]  president you know he likes you you know sent folks over to the office and then i didn't say
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:56.280]  nice things about george w bush i mean that's all they do is just collect talk shows like they're
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:03.480]  collecting t sets or something uh you know i'm not one of those people it's not me but i mean i
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:08.280]  i could be in hollywood what i'm saying is i'm not trying to like trump because he's patting me on the
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:15.240]  head i like trump because the whole new world order is against him from the communist chinese the
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:20.280]  biggest murders in history to the soly arabians so the creepiest murders in history probably
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:25.560]  right through to every dictatorship and drug dealer and slime bag and parasite you can imagine
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:31.640]  and it's all because he isn't out to screw us so they misrepresent everything he says
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:37.880]  and it's sick when i come back from this piece i'm going to play we're going to get into this
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:42.360]  nuclear war situation but this is such a big thing i almost want to just get like a briefing room
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:48.200]  with a big world map somewhere here in the office and just do like an electron with my facts and
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.920]  just give people geopolitical breakdowns and then historical breakdowns because it means reach the
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:58.920]  point of beyond even having a radio or tv show i mean i thought about just doing like an hour a
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:03.000]  day briefing or something where i just briefed the news and covered the biggest threats i think are
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:07.720]  of a concern instead of just trying to you know cover this much news and inform people that also
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:15.480]  make it interesting everything's so horrible and dangerous now it's a wonder i'm even sitting here
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.600]  still on air and having hotels with my kids because man let me tell you something i look at my eight
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:23.640]  year old daughter especially she's so little and i just feel like a guilty bastard for not
[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:27.240]  working with the rest of the family to get the hell out of here and get to the southern hemisphere
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:34.120]  i don't say that for effect i mean i i lose sleep now and i i've never felt guilty in my life but
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:40.360]  my flesh my love of my kids says get this country's gone it's demonic it's broke back it wants to
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:46.840]  fail it wants to lie it wants to be evil and just get out of here but you can't get out of here the
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:50.840]  whole world's under the control of this yeah you could buy some time maybe five ten twenty years
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:54.520]  whatever maybe you'll survive in the southern hemisphere a big nuclear war in the north probably
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:58.280]  not i just i'm just telling you the struggles i go through because
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:05.640]  the pentagon has been ordered to prepare for nuclear war with russia and move the weapons into
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:13.400]  place and we're run by psychopaths and trotskyites that have a big raging you know what for russia
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:17.880]  and it's just it's a bad situation and only being really concerned about it like the pentagon's
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:22.280]  gone and said they're concerned congress doesn't care they somehow don't get it they just think
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:26.600]  we've got such superiority that you can you don't win a war it's like of a guy
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:33.240]  he's going to get to shoot you six times with three seven magnum at ten feet away and you're
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:40.200]  going to shoot him six times with a barret 50 cal there's you're both dead no matter what
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:48.280]  and they just they're they just don't get it because they're given delusion that they've
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:53.240]  turned themselves over to whatever this world system is the spirit it is the spirit of
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:59.960]  of just being dumbasses being losers being unfaithful jack assery i guess is the word
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:08.840]  word invented a new word it's ass hattery but jack assery the delusionites i i don't know what you
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:16.760]  call it but i'm not just going to rearrange deck chairs here on a titanic okay i mean you got all
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:20.840]  these foreign nationals involved in our elections the un's coming in with with the e you to take
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:25.960]  over the election i mean even if you hate donald trump you ought to vote for him just for basic
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:30.120]  sovereignty but you're like i don't care if the u.s is run by foreign nationals big deal
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:34.040]  man you have no sense in your brain if you think that
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:39.800]  all right i'm going to play this report this is my response yesterday
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:45.960]  when i had promised my son for months i would take him with family hunting and we did do it
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:52.360]  i've canceled several times but i still shot a video in low res out in the middle of nowhere
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:58.360]  beautiful west texas only a day and a half we drove out there drove back last night and i was
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:01.480]  just reading the new york times when i got back to the little lodge where they did have a little
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:05.480]  bit of internet attacking and i thought i should respond to that because that's directly from the
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:09.800]  new world order that's a that's the mouth of sorum so i wanted to respond to that i'll come back
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:14.520]  with the nuclear war news and we have one of bill clinton's former girlfriends just to give you
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:18.120]  you know a mindset from somebody that didn't say she got raped but you know breaking it down hillary
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:22.360]  the other woman dolly kyle who i thought was an amazing interview uh over the phone she's here
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:27.080]  in person uh coming in but right now let's go ahead and go to this report my response to hillary
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:33.000]  obama uh and the new york times here it is it's said by many in the media that the new york times
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:38.840]  is the most prestigious outlet in the world they certainly were respected 50 60 years ago but they
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:43.400]  are one of the most discredited outlets in the world now but they are still the main vehicle
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:50.280]  with the washington post competing in second place for establishment disinformation the special
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:54.360]  members that have captured this nation are on record running the new york times and there have
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:50:00.360]  been four different waves of confirmed wiki leaks just the last few years where we have hillary clinton
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:06.200]  particularly giving orders to the new york times they go to her before they even run stories uh
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:12.760]  she controls what news they put out not just on her the democratic party but on many other issues
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:17.480]  so i'll hand this to hillary when you get into the emails and stuff she actually is running the show
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:23.080]  and is trying to establish an authoritarian system in this country now this is my response to hillary
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:28.040]  and to the combine she represents and the new york times as well as obama who's attacking me and
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:36.840]  basically implying i'm a crazy person i come on air with a lot of energy and i am almost hysterical
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:42.040]  at times because i read the documents i read the statements about the tpp openly admitting world
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:47.000]  government uh hillary's own emails have come out saying she wants to ban guns via executive order
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:52.440]  but that's in the news in major papers saying ban the second amendment they just live in this world
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:59.400]  where they deny all this is going on like saying obama cure is free or you can keep your doctor
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:04.360]  and then they go on charlie rose and laugh at us jason i think i love it wrote the line about um
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:15.160]  um if you like your insurance you can keep it so you can call me a conspiracy theorist all day
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:19.880]  long you try to use me as the poster boy to say look people that cover these issues aren't credible
[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:27.080]  i'm the poster boy that got all this information out i'm the person that did it in a theatrical way
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:31.480]  but always told the truth to break through to the public who was in a coma and that's to the new
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:36.600]  wiki leaks as well keep them dumbed down keep them in the dark keep them disinterested uh keep
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:41.160]  them distracted keep them diverted thank god they're not paying attention like ruber famously said
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:46.920]  about obama cure lack of transparency is a huge political advantage and basically you know call
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:52.200]  it the stupidity american voter or whatever but basically that was really really critical to get
[01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:56.360]  into the past and you know it's the second best argument look i wish mark was right we can make
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:00.360]  it all transparent but i'd rather have this law than not when i read the latest new york times
[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:06.440]  article today i could spend weeks just looking at the disinformation the spinning uh the taking
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:10.760]  out context to try to discredit myself donald trump and populist movements worldwide and i
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:15.320]  understand why the new york town represents global corporatism a modern form of anti free market
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:21.560]  crony capitalism that is the modern colonialism and they're using third world populations to
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:26.120]  basically wage economic warfare now on the first world and bring both down and they write white
[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:33.560]  papers about this separately when i was reading the story i saw another link to an article saying
[01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:38.840]  that donald trump is panicking because he's losing the race and claiming there's election fraud again
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:43.240]  you illustrate your hypocrisy and wonder why you're basically bankrupt if you'd have a foreign
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:49.160]  mexican owner and that's that the federal government says the russians are hacking the election and
[01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:54.920]  taking it over so they're federalizing it this weeks after i came out two months ago and said
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:58.920]  homeland security is planning to federalize it to steal it from trump because he's really
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:05.560]  10 to 15 points ahead then the president comes out and says i'm crazy that the feds aren't involved
[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:10.280]  in elections but then takes them over two and a half three weeks later and it's it's these
[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:14.920]  contradictions on every point you're announcing world government you're announcing you want our
[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:19.800]  guns you're announcing that the family unit's bad it's in white papers and textbooks that they're
[01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:24.840]  trying to get rid of the nuclear family to lower population numbers and promoting homosexuality
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:29.480]  i'm not making a judgment of homosexuality i'm a libertarian for god's sakes it's that you're
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:36.040]  saying you're attacking the family don't attack gays but don't attack the family that's all i'm
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:40.840]  saying but to address a few of the points they act like i'm a kook for saying the government wants
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:46.200]  to take our guns and i went on pierce morgan and said 1776 will commence again if you try to take
[01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:51.640]  him and then they go oh my god he warns of the end of humanity because of nuclear weapons and gmo's
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:58.360]  and human animal hybrids i mean top scientists across the board major institutions say the
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:03.000]  planet's in more danger of nuclear war or biological arm again than we've ever been
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:08.760]  but again they make it look kooky and weird to be concerned i'm a father of three i'm concerned
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:13.800]  about our mainstream media waging war on independent press and obama and the republicans working with
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:19.160]  them going after whistleblowers i talked about nsh buying with specifics with whistleblowers
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:23.640]  20 years ago the truth is people that have attached their wagon to this corrupt establishment
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:29.960]  are on the wrong side of history i've been right i've told the truth infillwars.com has been a
[01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:35.960]  trailblazing institution that's grassroots we're an old hoity-toity and polished with teleprompters
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:41.560]  like you are but even when i'm on the road in a hotel room visiting family i'm ready to come in
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:46.600]  and hit back and take action because i know that people deserve the truth and i believe in humanity
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:51.800]  and i want to turn the tide the truth is donald trump is a patriot as well the truth is you guys
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:56.600]  are crucifying him for doing one one hundredth what bill and hillary clinton have done but let
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:01.640]  me address just one more of the other points they raise that i could say has some legitimacy
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:07.080]  and that's the criticism that i'm seeing hillary and obama are literal actual demons
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:13.400]  folks i've been told this by high up folks they say listen obama and hillary both smell like sulfur
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:17.720]  i never said this because the media go crazy with but i've talked to people that are in protective
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:23.880]  details that i mean they're scared of and they say listen she's a freaking demon and she stinks
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:32.040]  and so does obama i go like what sulfur they smell like hell now to be specific i'm not saying
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:36.680]  they're from the pit of hell i can see how that comes off and it's a legitimate criticism i don't
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:42.280]  believe they actually i mean float around like ghost fosters like slimer or something and are from a
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:48.600]  literal hell but in a allegory way they might as well be demons from hell hillary funding jihadis
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:53.560]  and isis on record all over the world killing christians supporting radical islam that oppresses
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:59.320]  women uh doing all the horrible things she's done treating her staff horribly uh saying i came i saw
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:05.800]  qaddafi died destabilizing africa uh selling tainted blood uh look at that in the 80s and 90s out of
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:09.880]  arkansas when they were basically co-governors and knowing that hiv in it i mean the crimes of the
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:14.360]  clinton are legion these are nasty people her own constituents can't stand her she stole the
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:20.200]  nomination from barry sanders stanford university certified that six months ago so yes she is a
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:26.760]  demon in the fact that she's like a serial killer you know we say jeffrey dommer is a literal demon
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:32.200]  we don't mean he's from the pit of hell but he's a literal stinking demon you know we have famous
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:37.240]  essays where they were talking about treating the uh you know iris so bad they said why don't we just
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:42.920]  go ahead and you know raise their kids and sell them as as you know raw meat that was satire so we
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:47.320]  went into the edge of satire and i should have been a little bit clearer but i don't attract the
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:52.680]  fact that she behaves like the metaphysical historical demons we read about in history books
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:57:00.440]  or the bible the truth is the establishment media is a dying dinosaur the credibility in the system
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:05.160]  can never be gotten back because we're run by multinational offshore corporations that brag
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:10.280]  about it we're now under foreign treaties we never even ratified we're going under global government
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:15.480]  and so i was right about that and hundreds of other issues i have credibility you know and i know
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:20.760]  it upsets you with your big fancy high-rise buildings and all your big titles that people know
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:26.760]  you've basically on average have it out to get them so obama hillary the new york times all of you
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:32.040]  you have chosen your lot this is who you are there's still time to try to back out of it and redeem
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:35.400]  yourselves but something tells me you're not going to do it but there is time for other people in the
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:40.200]  media and the power structure to realize globalism isn't taking us to a good place and whether you
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:44.280]  like all its shows or hey hey i'm just a regular guy and i'm trying to get people's attention to
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:49.640]  cause a debate on these issues and that's what we cover at info wars dot com on my radio show every
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:54.680]  single all right uh and that full reports up on info wars dot com is we got a break here just

[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:03.960]  because sometimes i take a little bit of valerian root or melatonin i didn't like having a bunch
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:09.000]  of different bottles of it if you just take one thing after a while it quits working well guess
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.800]  what especially now when i can't sleep fighting the globe will take it so wound up valerian root
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:20.280]  eltryptophan melatonin lemon balm leaf extract ga ba and a lot of other amazing compounds for
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:26.920]  1995 the same dose of melatonin is usually 1995 this is all organic it's the ultimate sleep uh i
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:30.600]  don't take it but once or twice a week normally now i'm taking a lot more often is because stuff's
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:36.680]  so crazy i get such better sleep it's available and it's 25 off for a limited time that ends after

[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:30.760]  the info war powerful weapon deployed by the clinton's is the corporate media the press
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:37.240]  let's be clear on one thing
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:46.680]  the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism
[02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:56.120]  they're a political special interest no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:01:02.520]  a total political agenda and the agenda is not for you it's for themselves
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:18.520]  and their agenda is to elect crooked hillary clinton at any cost at any price no matter how
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:32.760]  many lives they destroy for them it's a war and for them nothing at all is out of bounds this is
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:42.200]  a struggle for the survival of our nation believe me and this will be our last chance to save it
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:48.520]  on november 8 remember that you know what's incredible about watching trump's speeches
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:54.040]  unedited like i do on a routine basis he gives three or four a day has such amazing stamina so i
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:59.720]  don't catch more than maybe one a day and maybe it's eight o'clock at night the kids have done
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:05.000]  their homework they've taken showers we've had dinner and we don't watch a lot of tv we watch
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.880]  movies a couple times a week or whatever and i let them watch a few shows here and there when
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:14.920]  they've done their chores and done a good job and gotten straight a's but we'll all just sit down
[02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:18.600]  and in my eight year old my 12 year old daughter and my and my 14 year old son and i say what do
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:23.720]  you want to watch they say we want to go to uh the donald trump channel on youtube we want to
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:29.080]  watch his speech today and we'll go there and we'll we'll oh look there's five speeches today
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:34.040]  which one would you like to watch and we'll sit down and we'll watch donald trump for 30 minutes
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:40.200]  or an hour my children they all teach you your kids don't want to listen to you your kids don't
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:47.880]  want to admire you you study history you're fighting evil and you're in a tribal situation and your
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:52.280]  kids understand it all they want to do is do what you say but they want to get our families
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:57.080]  destabilized from the beginning while fighting with each other once they get the unnatural dynamic
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:03:02.280]  going once they try to convince the man to act like a child the woman to act like she's the boss
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:09.240]  and get everything destabilized once that starts it's like a top a gyro wobbling a gyro that's
[02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:16.200]  stable is going perfect a gyro that's wobbling it's out of control and once kids get it that
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:20.360]  we're a family we've got to stick together we care about each other and we only care about
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:26.120]  people that care about us and that people that are truthful and nice and not that my kids are
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:33.000]  perfect you know they're far from enough spoiled them at certain levels but they win all the everything
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:38.920]  i mean it's amazing um he could do it at state level he wanted to but we you didn't need to
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:43.800]  but but brex is now a man he had me on the air and over a year he's been so busy but
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:49.080]  he wants to be on areas on air soon but he looks like he's about 16 17 14 he's turned 14
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:52.920]  and he wins all the big speech debate deals he wins all the big
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:04:00.120]  big i mean you name it um and i'm not bragging about my kids it's just that they're confident
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:05.000]  they know what's going on in the world they got a gleam in their eye look at the average kid that
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.440]  gleams been stolen from and i want my kids play video games folks i don't let them sit there and
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:15.240]  just sit there with a smartphone all day and drool i have phones i give to them when they're going
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:18.680]  somewhere i want to know what they're at it's like big brother well government's gonna watch you i'm
[02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:22.920]  gonna watch you too here go with this are you gonna do a sleepover boom take this with you but
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:29.000]  it's like a weapon it's like an evil we roll out for limited uses you know because because we we have
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.800]  ways of turning that towards good at least we believe we do none of us are perfect but
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:45.160]  it's actually true the country is done the world's done uh if if the brexit fails if europe
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:50.440]  continues the eu and if trump doesn't get in i mean if nationalism and patriotism doesn't win
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:55.720]  because globalism is pure death globalism is world government globalism is scientific tyranny it's
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:05:03.160]  the enemy obama care has been a topic of discussion at the debates one candidate trump wanting to rid

[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:43.720]  in syria in 2012 the u.s was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups and why did

[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:25.800]  ladies and gentlemen we are all part of it history is happening donald trump has said
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:31.160]  the future of this country surviving is on the line not that he's perfect he'll tell you that
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:35.800]  but that the globalist are ending national sovereignty world government has been announced
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:41.320]  and thank god he came along who had the courage to magnify our work ron paul's work your work

[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:53.160]  notice since nigel ferrage of ukip we've been interviewing for 15 years uh met with uh trump
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:57.960]  and has actually been staying in the u.s coaching him since the disastrous first debate
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:03.400]  uh trump's gotten 10 times more hardcore against the globalist and how it's about sovereignty
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:07.640]  and outside interests like carlos slim of mexico really an arab uh and the communist
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:13.080]  chinese and the and the islamist the soly arabians controlling us notice trump suddenly has become
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:23.160]  laser beam very powerful and that's because ferrage is basically as informed as i am or even more
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:26.760]  him he's i mean i've had dinner with him i've known him for years uh he was obviously on the
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:29.640]  show just a few weeks ago we've done tape interviews with him we're going to be talking to him again
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:35.160]  next week ferrage gets the whole deal he's the guy that helped begin the fall of the e u now every
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:40.600]  e u country is demanding a referendum because no one was allowed to have a referendum just just
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:45.320]  suddenly under the e u because your politicians sell you out like obama saying we're under the tpp
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:52.200]  in the carbon tax even if we don't ratify it and the media is like obama's smart he doesn't need
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:56.120]  congress he's just gonna ratify it let's not smart to break the law it's not smart to just have the
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:13:04.680]  bureaucracy do whatever it wants but that's the big widespread you know 40 000 35 000 foot view
[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:10.200]  it's important to zoom in and do snapshots of different individuals now i'm not one to defend
[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:15.320]  bill clinton but i've been covering the clinton's for 21 years on air i've been following it for
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:26.360]  23 years since they became you know husband or since that election uh in 1992 1993 and hillary
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:31.640]  to me is the main villain and i don't say that because that's a campaign strategy and you know
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:35.800]  we'll you know we'll talk about bill how bad he is but how she's even worse it's the truth it's
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:40.680]  come out she was president already basically eight years co-president she is the one that handled the
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:46.520]  quote bimbo eruptions she is the one that what is actually out doing the work and making the money and
[02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:51.240]  and and selling the country out as we see in the clinton foundation bill spending most this time
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:55.400]  partying and he does do some work obviously he's now a surrogate for her because she's obviously ill
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:14:00.360]  but looking at what just comes out and all the horrible things hillary does in these wiki leaks
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:05.080]  and how she hates the american people is mind boggling but we had a lady on one of the you know
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:09.560]  many folks that have been you know connected to clinton's who's spoken out but i wanted to have
[02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:14.280]  her here in person i appreciate her coming down from arkansas a lovely lady both in her looks
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:20.200]  and also in her demeanor because she really i thought connected with myself in the audience
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:23.640]  she's not somebody that says bill clinton raped her she's somebody that dated bill clinton
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:29.400]  but can speak to the whole situation really from a very honest perspective but it's now come out
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:33.960]  they're calling thousands of former contestants in all of his pageants going back 30 years and
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:37.640]  and they're coming out saying i'm not gonna lie for you but they're really going after trump
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:42.840]  right now and trying to project onto trump who bill clinton was so that even becomes a distraction
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:49.560]  onto who is hillary but the book dolly kyle a political memoir hillary the other woman forwarded
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:55.240]  by uh david p shepherds is a great patriot he was the head impeachment lawyer who exposed that
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:15:01.160]  the actually ken star was a chinese agent and basically worked for the chinese now officially
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:05.880]  works for him that's been proven he was the chief investigative counsel for the clinton impeachment
[02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:10.440]  we should try to get you know folks from that whole impeachment back on uh we have had the
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:15.080]  former congressman from george obviously on uh but if you're going to talk tell the whole story
[02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:20.040]  there has to be absolute accountability that's hillary clinton quote you're a great writer dolly
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:25.720]  promises me you will never censor anything you might want to say bill clinton dolly is keeping
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:30.120]  her promise not to censor the truth she is telling the whole truth here but hillary will not be happy
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:36.200]  about it hillary is the one being called to account for her lies shady financial deals uh racial
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:41.080]  discrimination the one chef got killed the other chefs come out and said it's true she would just
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:46.360]  scream n word and flip out foul mouth flip-flopping destruction of government records from arkansas
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:51.480]  to washington the Benghazi lack of true feminist credentials and her decades long history of
[02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:56.600]  attacking many women who were used and abused by her husband the co-president i'ma skip this
[02:15:56.600 --> 02:16:02.200]  network break we have more time uh with dolly kyle here today but uh thank you so much for
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:07.320]  coming into studio with us well you're very welcome i'm happy to be here alex you're awesome wow uh
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:10.520]  i mean i've thrown a lot out there you should probably just recap where folks didn't hear you
[02:16:10.520 --> 02:16:16.280]  on a few months ago who you are what happened what unfolded i ran to you and clave one at the rnc
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:21.720]  as well and then just your perspective if somebody who's been there since what high school or was
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:27.560]  even earlier with bill clinton right i met billy when i was 11 and he was 12 going on 13 we got
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:32.920]  middle school yeah well i went to catholic school so we didn't break it up like that
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:37.960]  eighth grade but then there were no other catholic schools there but billy was uh we were at hot
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:45.400]  springs high school together then we graduated in 64 so uh we're in the same class and yes i am
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:50.520]  two years younger because i skipped two grades so let's get the bimbo thing out of the way right
[02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:55.480]  now okay no bimbo here i am a lawyer you look like a bimbo and you look amazing for your age
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:17:03.640]  you look you're about 45 i'll take it thank you i'm gonna i'm joking now anyway um the important
[02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:09.800]  thing is really not so much the fact that i had an adult sexual relationship with billy but the fact
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:17.960]  that i have known him since i was 11 years old and i am an intelligent observant person and i know
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:22.920]  what's been going on with the clinton's for all these years so that's what's important i did not
[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:29.240]  want to write this book alex but when i saw hillary look into the camera and get that fake sincere
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:33.720]  look that she has and say that women who've been raped and sexually assaulted should be believed
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:39.480]  okay that did it for me i was ready to throw a shoe at the tv screen but it was a new tv
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:44.440]  and it wouldn't have done me any good so i wrote this book instead and i just started it last year
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:47.640]  at the beginning and your own record you know in the year books with clinton i mean i don't think
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:52.920]  he's really he's not denied that he that you were his girlfriend either well actually i know early on
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:58.360]  he didn't um early on of course he didn't but then i was subpoenaed to testify in the paula jones case
[02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:05.720]  and billy's lawyers wanted me to not testify not because we didn't have a relationship but because
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:11.320]  our relationship was consensual and the jones case was about sexual harassment so billy's own
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:16.200]  lawyers prepared an affidavit for me to sign saying that our relationship was consensual
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:21.880]  and they wanted me to file a motion in federal court not to testify because i didn't know about
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:28.680]  harassment only about these consensual sex the problem that billy's lawyers did not know was
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:34.440]  that i was going to testify about billy's sex addiction which he had confessed to me after
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:41.800]  alex i found out i was a sex addict and i got into therapy and i told billy about that as any friend
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:48.200]  would do well it must be a terrible thing to be a sex addict well actually alex anyone who can
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:53.640]  have a drink at a cocktail party and enjoy it thinks that alcohol is fine i have nothing against alcohol
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:59.960]  but if you take one drink and you can't stop and you ruin your life then it's not so great
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:03.880]  absolutely no i mean what is a sex addict that somebody just can't control themselves
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:08.920]  there are a lot of aspects of it just as there are different kinds of alcoholics and i say
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:13.400]  alcoholics because more people have more experience with that more knowledge of it there's an alcoholic
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:17.400]  who gets up in the morning and has alcohol for breakfast there's one who doesn't drink until five
[02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:21.640]  o'clock there's one who binges on the weekends there's one who binges every six months there's
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:26.360]  all different sorts of alcoholism but it does not excuse someone driving down the street drunk
[02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:31.000]  and killing a person no i totally agree with you so so i mean bill clinton i mean isn't admitted
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:36.200]  like superstar sex addict i mean what's the word on it i reportedly up to ten women a day when he
[02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:41.480]  was president well i don't know how many women per day i do know that once a long time ago we were
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:46.440]  discussing wilt chamberlain who was the african-american basketball star who said he'd had sex with
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:53.400]  20 000 women and billy and i were talking about that and he said whoa that's 10 times more than
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:58.600]  i've had and i think he said that with a bit of admiration and a little jealousy but he was saying
[02:19:58.600 --> 02:20:04.840]  he really had 2000 yeah and let's say he was exaggerating and it was only 1000 how's that
[02:20:04.840 --> 02:20:10.760]  that better i don't think so all i think all in any manner one wants to find is the is the right
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:16.840]  person there's one and that's who you love well i don't think he knows about love well i can say
[02:20:16.840 --> 02:20:22.280]  personally just raw sex for me is empty i was a little promiscuous when i was younger nothing
[02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:27.640]  like wil chamberlain or bill clinton but it just was so empty and for me sex is really all about
[02:20:27.640 --> 02:20:34.440]  the relationship it should be and what happened and i'm not excusing it but when i was a 16 year
[02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:40.600]  old virgin i was drugged and raped by one of billy clinton's friends and a rape will change the
[02:20:40.600 --> 02:20:46.600]  trajectory of someone's life now sometimes people don't admit they don't even admit to themselves
[02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:51.560]  what happened in this and the effect does it either either person becomes very withdrawn and
[02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:59.160]  a spencer or they become wild well that's what i talk about in my book yes and again that's hillary
[02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:03.560]  the other woman so so going back to where you started that was intriguing you were suddenly
[02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:08.360]  when was it you were spurred into action spurred into the spotlight because of hillary and the
[02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:12.200]  way she was behaving uh you know claiming we should always stand up for women that are assaulted
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:19.960]  but then going after bill's victims well that was just at the beginning of 2016 i mean i wrote 92
[02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:25.800]  thousand words in 65 days of writing i did take off on sundays i also want to say to anyone who
[02:21:25.800 --> 02:21:31.320]  wants to start throwing stones right now that having the affair with billy was wrong i have
[02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:36.840]  repented i have changed my life and i had invited him to do that too but that hasn't happened yet
[02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:40.600]  yeah well nobody's judging anybody for consensual sex even though i can't get out of hand and i
[02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:44.760]  think you're saying it was out of hand absolutely nobody's judging you for i mean that give me a
[02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:49.640]  break and anybody that tries that especially the left they're all oh sex party all this degenerate
[02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:56.440]  stuff but then they act like you know like like these uh super obsessed you know orthodox people
[02:21:56.440 --> 02:22:01.560]  when somebody conservatives involved in it it seems like a very very one-sided situation well it
[02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:06.760]  absolutely is and here's the other thing forget the sexual relationship that i had with billy
[02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:12.520]  because my entire family he's been friends with the clinton's family for years so i have an inside
[02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:18.760]  observation whether or not billy and now i ever had a relationship has bill clinton got more evil
[02:22:18.760 --> 02:22:24.760]  or less evil over time oh my goodness you know i didn't know anything was wrong with him until
[02:22:24.760 --> 02:22:29.880]  the night in 1974 when he introduced me to hillary and that was the night of the democrat
[02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:36.360]  convention in arkansas and hillary had come in from washington but i did not know that billy
[02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:42.600]  called and asked me to pick him up at the airport and wanted me to take him to the um television
[02:22:42.600 --> 02:22:48.440]  headquarters and then to fulbright headquarters i said sure i mean this was no big deal we were
[02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:55.080]  adults we were dating i was divorced at that time and so it was a totally open sexual relationship
[02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:59.480]  he was also seeing marla crider at the university that's pretty wild though he's got you hot blonde
[02:22:59.480 --> 02:23:03.640]  going over to pick up his other girlfriend well yeah but i didn't know that and so he showed up at
[02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:07.560]  the airport so he's pretty bold he showed up at the airport with this dowdy looking middle-aged
[02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:12.280]  woman and three guys in suits and when they got closer i realized that the dowdy middle-aged woman
[02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:19.160]  was just dowdy but not middle-aged and billy said dolly this is hillary hillary did he tell you
[02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:26.840]  dolly wow did did he tell you she was a cia officer oh no no he didn't say anything about that and
[02:23:26.840 --> 02:23:32.280]  one thing that you need to understand about billy and all other addicts is that they will tell
[02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:39.640]  different people different things so that they never exposed themselves excuse the pun uh completely
[02:23:39.640 --> 02:23:45.400]  to anyone but they show different sides of themselves for example billy showed his
[02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:49.720]  cocaine addiction to other people but not to me because he knew i was very definitely against
[02:23:49.720 --> 02:23:55.160]  drugs so he wouldn't bring that up he could show a sex addiction to me because that was okay because
[02:23:55.160 --> 02:23:59.800]  i understood that he was a he was a chameleon absolutely okay so we got to this part it's the
[02:23:59.800 --> 02:24:05.080]  first time 1974 democrat convention happened in arkansas here comes hillary with the guys in suits
[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:11.640]  whether uh tells what happens next well we my first thought was oh dear remember the seinfeld
[02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:16.600]  episode with the valet parker who smelled bad yes uh well i thought the first thing i thought was oh
[02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:23.240]  my gosh i have cloth seats in my car and believe me i was worried about my car but i let this woman
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:29.960]  get in there anyway she smelled that bad she really did alex she really truly did and i'm not just
[02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:36.200]  being tacky call me margaret meadon samoa i had never seen or smelled any woman like that ever
[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:43.320]  did we talk before you got here today no why when's the last time you talked about well i guess on
[02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:48.920]  the radio show yeah month ago we fly by the seat of our pants we're just boom boom boom yeah it's a
[02:24:48.920 --> 02:24:52.840]  big nash are you aware of the national controversy right now concerning me i mean the president
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:58.600]  responded to it no i don't think so what happened it was the top story three days ago i just shed
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:03.080]  from my secret service sources they and i also talked to people in protective detail from the
[02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:09.320]  pentagon they said we don't know what's going on but hillary smells like a dead pig and i talked
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:13.080]  about it and they said i was completely insane i said she smells like a demon and that obama
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:17.960]  stinks to our heaven oh i did hear that yes about the demon thing yeah but i don't know what a dead
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:23.880]  pig smells like i do well the point is they smell like hell but but it's funny but i don't
[02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:26.760]  know if you're right about the book but wow that's crazy i mean we're gonna how bad she smelled i'm
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:31.640]  just telling you people are telling me she smells so what she smell like just i don't know i'd never
[02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:36.760]  smelled anything like that before i mean her hair was dirty and greasy and her dress was stained
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:44.760]  so i assume it was something on her inner she hadn't bathed i i said i've had two black water people
[02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:51.960]  an army colonel to secret service just say we're scared of her she blows up and screams half the
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:58.520]  time fits falls down angry i mean like a two-year-old and smells like and i go what they go it's the
[02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:01.640]  worst smell you've ever smelled and i'm it's just you didn't even know this and here you are bringing
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:06.840]  it up no because it was the first one of the first things that i noticed and who could not notice
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:10.440]  someone who smelled that bad especially when they were going to get in my car with cloths that's what
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:13.960]  i tell listeners i'm not going to make this up if we're not getting these sources so so well ask
[02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:19.160]  anyone in arkansas who met her back then don't don't take my word for it this wasn't just normal
[02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:26.120]  hippie body odor i wouldn't think so all right please continue so what else are you stinking
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:30.520]  creature arriving the thing that really bothered me that night i started to talk about you said
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:37.880]  is billy more evil now you would have to know how important senator bill fulbright was in billy
[02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:44.280]  clinton's life in order to get this at the level that i do but when billy clinton went to georgetown
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:52.120]  as a freshman in 1964 bill fulbright gave him a job fulbright had been i don't know 64 he'd been 20
[02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:57.960]  years in the in the senate from arkansas at that point he gave billy a job he introduced him to
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:03.240]  everybody in washington who was important when billy wanted to go to oxford bill fulbright helped
[02:27:03.240 --> 02:27:07.160]  him get the road scholarship he helped him to get into yale he helped him to get a job at the
[02:27:07.160 --> 02:27:13.080]  university of arkansas teaching and then when billy in 1974 was running for congress from the
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:18.200]  um fourth congressional district in northwest arkansas a good memory it was bill fulbright
[02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:23.640]  who introduced him to the big money folks who would support that race so i say all that to say this
[02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:29.320]  the night of may 28th 1974 the democrat primary i picked up billy at the airport we went to the
[02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:33.080]  tv station so billy could do a statewide interview which was the only place you could do that at
[02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:40.040]  the time and maybe still now i'm not sure anyway um while he was doing the interview this strange
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:43.640]  smelling person who i really didn't believe was hillary i thought it was some kind of a
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:47.720]  joke because billy had told me two years before that he was moving in with a law student named
[02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:51.560]  hillary she had a place to live no big deal as a toad looking creature with goggle glasses
[02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:55.320]  it was not pretty it was not pretty it smells like a pet of hell dirty hair
[02:27:56.200 --> 02:28:02.600]  all of that anyway all linsky worshippers she was watching the election returns and then when
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:08.040]  we left the tv station to go to fulbright headquarters billy said well we need to go back
[02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:12.120]  to the airport and i said why we were going to fulbright headquarters they're expecting you
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:18.840]  i mean you can't know this this man fulbright was like billy's father godfather never had no
[02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:23.880]  not godfather like a father he never had it was it was critically important and billy said well
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:28.760]  we're not going didn't you see the election returns fulbright's losing i said yeah sure he's losing
[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:35.800]  i mean all the more reason to go over and support him and billy said i don't want to be seen with a
[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:43.160]  loser and i felt like i'd been kicked in the stomach and of course i thought about what about
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:47.720]  this that's what i always hear is they love to betray their friends now at this point it begins
[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:52.520]  well yeah and here's the thing i was so upset about that and of course i didn't realize that
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:56.360]  hillary was hillary i seriously i thought it was a joke really i thought it was a joke
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:29:01.160]  so i didn't realize billy had kicked me in the gut can we pull up a photo of hillary in college
[02:29:01.160 --> 02:29:05.480]  or would she work in the nixon anti-nixon committee i mean let's let's pull her up it looks like a joke
[02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:13.240]  please continue okay anyway i i was devastated to realize that billy would turn his back on bill
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:18.360]  fulbright like that i really was it made me physically sick the same kind of physically
[02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:23.480]  sick i was when i saw one nita broderick's interview with lisa mire on date light nbc and
[02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:28.600]  found out he was also a rapist and we have those clips when we come back so to you it's the dishonor
[02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:33.880]  robin oh my gosh yes well it's funny you know i hillary had all those men in suits around her
[02:29:33.880 --> 02:29:38.680]  she was oh no no no these were billy's friends this was not the guys in suits then these were just
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:42.920]  billy's point is i mean it's been declassified she was like a cia his controller by the time
[02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:47.880]  they moved to england and all the rest of it later and it's an amazing story her dad was like a mob
[02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:58.920]  boss in chicago we'll be back umpires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network we're
[02:29:58.920 --> 02:30:03.720]  read on election day perhaps the biggest election in american history is just days away we know that
[02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:08.040]  in past elections there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud and election fraud from
[02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:12.520]  dead people voting to people registering false identifications to government leaders providing
[02:30:12.520 --> 02:30:17.080]  fast-track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes this is happening right in front of us now
[02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:21.400]  we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the republican nominee donald trump
[02:30:21.400 --> 02:30:25.400]  government chills are campaigning for clinton mainstream news attacking donald trump all
[02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:30.360]  day like rabbit hounds rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics that hillary
[02:30:30.360 --> 02:30:34.760]  clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting trump fake celebrities endorsing
[02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:39.320]  clinton across all platforms so with all this what are we doing to keep this election from being
[02:30:39.320 --> 02:30:43.960]  stolen what can we do to prevent election fraud i propose that all donald trump supporters wear
[02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:48.440]  red on election day on november eight when you head to the polls to vote donald trump be decked out
[02:30:48.440 --> 02:30:53.080]  in red this way just as we dominated in rally turnout we can prove and provide the optics that
[02:30:53.080 --> 02:30:58.840]  we also dominated in voter turnout wear red on election day and make america great again clean

[02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:31.400]  it's time to kick the persistence in the high gear
[02:33:48.600 --> 02:33:52.680]  i was just talking to dolly kyle and she's nervous to say this but i was i was looking at her because
[02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:58.040]  i know she went to law school on the top folks in her class she's very successful economically
[02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:02.200]  she didn't want to come out and write this book with world net daily books she did it because she
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:07.240]  felt compelled to do it and she said well i mean i was going from memory because i knew that from
[02:34:07.240 --> 02:34:10.200]  inside baseball knowing the publishers that you basically don't even want any money
[02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:14.280]  because they've asked me to publish a book with them too i've just been too busy quite frankly
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:19.160]  great publishers over at world net daily books get the book hillary the other woman dolly kyle
[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:25.960]  total credibility uh in fact let's we should go through your curriculum vitae for new listeners
[02:34:25.960 --> 02:34:30.840]  you're not doing this to sell a book you're doing it to try to wake people up and expose what happens
[02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:36.680]  if we let these criminals continue to be empowered you said well yes i can't do it on your show
[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:41.400]  because you're too big because i've been telling people if you can't afford it i'll send you a
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:46.600]  copy or send you a check to get it you've actually been doing that but so don't do that here you just
[02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:51.240]  want this to get out you're not doing this for money you're doing this for honor so continue
[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:56.840]  with your story continue breaking it down well i do want to say this i did send my publisher a
[02:34:56.840 --> 02:35:01.960]  request this morning that see if we could lower the price of the kindle version of this book at
[02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:06.520]  least between now and the election there are limitations what you can do with amazon oh i know
[02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:11.880]  we're selling our hillary for president shirt at cost i'm spending the backup money we have because
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:16.200]  any operation want this has to have backup money yeah but i know it's so serious the last six months
[02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:23.320]  i've hired more people done more just put everybody's sale on we can to try to defeat the globalist
[02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:27.480]  because i can feel in my gut this is such a game changer we're we're all in at this point that's
[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:32.760]  absolutely true i do want to say one more thing about amazon my book went to number one on kindle
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:37.240]  i took a screenshot that day i was so tickled because hamilton had been number one and i was
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:42.200]  number two that hamilton was so huge and then one day wow i went to number one and the next day
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:45.880]  it was number one and so i was looking for my number one sticker from amazon because you know
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:50.600]  once you hit number one then you can always say i was a number one best seller on amazon right
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:54.760]  forever except they wouldn't give me the number one sticker and i had my publisher call and say
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:59.160]  what's the deal and they said well there's more to getting a number one sticker than being number
[02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:04.680]  one and my publisher said so what else is there well that's proprietary information
[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:09.080]  which means we decide who who who gets that it's exactly but but what's coming up this
[02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:12.760]  election is how rigged everything is everyone should get the book hillary the other woman
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:17.800]  available on amazon worldnetdaily.com i'm not being paid to promote any of this i'm doing this to
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:23.000]  get the word out because this is a very credible lady uh exposing all of this now now let's walk
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:27.720]  into where bill plenton goes from there what's happening with these women and why you're speaking
[02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:32.680]  out you mentioned wanita broderick we've had on years ago and then i guess about six months ago
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:39.960]  here's the first clip wanita broderick supports bill clinton rape protest this is a national
[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:43.960]  movement we launched it's very successful because they want to send their people
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:48.040]  find about george soros to beat people up and start riots we don't do that we say legally
[02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:53.400]  lawfully go and you were telling me you're aware of this movement yes i am and and someone sent a
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:59.720]  tweet about it the other day and i said hey thank alex jones for that because you started it well i
[02:36:59.720 --> 02:37:02.840]  want to thank the listeners that are going out and doing it but yes our our listeners are who we
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:07.080]  thank and they're awesome folks yeah apparently so well it's happened two or three times a day
[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:11.800]  obama hillary bill and i'm told hillary was even the associate of press she's getting pissed
[02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:15.960]  actually saying she may cancel events because of it well of course and because she cannot
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:20.760]  face truth this is one of the big things about hillary she can't talk about her psychology
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:26.360]  i've had two secret service on fbi on everybody they say she won't she won't give tips little
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:31.560]  people she blows up that don't look her in the eyes and that she she just blows up constantly
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:37.000]  what's going on with her i explain this in a couple of chapters in the book so it's pretty hard to
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:45.880]  cover it all right now but we all know even from hillary's own autobiography what a sad childhood
[02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:52.360]  she had with a controlling a drill sergeant kind of father whom she never could please i also think
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:58.440]  and this is completely my opinion based on what i know about sex addiction that i believe hillary
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:04.760]  was sexually assaulted by a female i also believe that she was sexually assaulted by a male possibly
[02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:11.560]  someone in military uniform which is why she hates the military she hates men she hates women she
[02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:15.560]  and i said that you said that like four months ago when you're on it but it's in the wiki league she
[02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:20.520]  hates the military exactly and i said she hates americans she hates everyone don't you see because
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:25.720]  she hates herself and you can look at a video of her turn off the sound and look at the hate
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:30.760]  coming out of her eyes i mean it's hate and well that's what general flin said former
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:34.920]  head of army intelligence and i've been told by folks there's a psychological dossier in her and
[02:38:34.920 --> 02:38:38.120]  that's why the russians have done their own breakdown that's everybody's so concerned they
[02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:43.240]  say they believe she'll start major wars that she hates everyone and that she is extremely unstable
[02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:47.480]  and general flin has said that he they believe she's unstable well the other thing too about the
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:53.160]  russians it's very interesting that hillary is now blaming these wiki leaks on the russians
[02:38:53.880 --> 02:39:00.520]  and think about that people the clinton foundation hillary took tens of millions of dollars from the
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:08.360]  russians 35 million yeah um and turned over 20 of our uranium supplies to the russians
[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:13.640]  and what hillary does with the russians and with everything else pay attention to this very carefully
[02:39:13.640 --> 02:39:20.040]  everything that she does that she says someone else does like trump it's all projection 101 if she
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:24.840]  says trump it's racist it's because she's racist if he says she's controlled by the he's controlled
[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:30.600]  by the russians it's because she's controlled by the russians and it was very simple for the russians
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:36.280]  for anyone else to find out who was behind the wiki leaks and if anyone thinks that seth rich
[02:39:36.280 --> 02:39:43.640]  was killed randomly in a robbery on the back shot in the back in washington think again this guy was
[02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:48.760]  going to talk to the fbi and anyone who knew anything knew it now here's the other thing
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:52.680]  they did not try to hide the fact that this was a hit i mean i grew up in hot springs you know
[02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:56.680]  alex i got some great chapters in here that's a famous that was a real mafia headquarters it was
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:02.440]  it was a wonderful place the wonderful place to grow up and and find out interesting things about
[02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:07.560]  people but here's the deal this was a hit and they intended for people to know it was a hit
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:13.800]  because this is one of the ways they intimidate other people it's like well it's like scalia
[02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:18.120]  they had ounce of pillows on his head that there will be no autopsy the first announcement
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:23.400]  and they put the news he was in a secret society there just to demonize him uh it was a hunting
[02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:29.400]  society and now we have podesta the chief of staff for hillary talk about wet work two days
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:35.400]  before he died say get ready well and look what happened when vince foster died that was more wet
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:42.040]  work died and billy supposedly found out about it on larry king lives and the first thing he said
[02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:47.720]  now here's his friend of his friend since childhood maybe since the the playpen i think their mothers
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:52.520]  were friends when they were pregnant from hope arkansas and the first thing billy says when he
[02:40:52.520 --> 02:41:00.840]  finds out his longtime friend is dead he says well we'll never know what really happened really
[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:05.800]  we'll never know that's his first reaction he's shot in the head with no blood at the scene
[02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:10.440]  obviously taken there yeah and that's his reaction what was your reaction be if one of your longtime
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:16.200]  friends was committed suicide i'd get dizzy i'd sit there and be i'd say really i'd start crying
[02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:18.520]  yeah well you're human
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:26.280]  but you were saying earlier on bill seemed more human he seems to am i wrong to say hillary's
[02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:30.200]  the boss though from all my research over the years all the witnesses seems to be she's the boss
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:36.040]  she found this flawed guy she made him worse he wasn't a beard for homosexuality she was a beard
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:41.800]  for his drug abuse and sex behavior it's hard to say that she really controls him i talked about
[02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:46.920]  in the book the attraction was that she is his mean controlling grandmother remember he was not
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:51.320]  raised by his mother for the first four or five years of his life now why does she get all glassy
[02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:55.640]  out and keep calling trump my my husband and then she only went off script to talk about me and i'm
[02:41:55.640 --> 02:41:58.040]  not getting on a power trip because i don't want to retract to me but she when she talks about me
[02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:03.640]  she goes how does he have such a dark heart she gets like i mean now when she attacks me she kind
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:07.400]  of acts all weird like she'll be given a speech he talks about me she gets real weird what the
[02:42:07.400 --> 02:42:12.440]  hell's going on it's really creepy it is creepy and that's unfortunately not the creepiest thing
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:17.400]  about her but so what do you think the psychology is your cops your lawyer well and you know i was
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:21.000]  a psych major before i knew that you're smart lady so what do you think's going on with her
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:26.120]  um he talks about trump she starts seeming she seems to get excited well like she seems a little
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:30.520]  bit attracted to trump i mean i pick up the body language i'm sorry well here's the thing about
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:37.320]  trump he's a real man he is a real man and i think that's what's attracting a lot of people
[02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:44.040]  just like men were attracted to john wane in a way i mean you know that he swagger's in and he
[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:49.480]  takes control and he solves the problems and i think that's what we all recognize that donald
[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:54.760]  trump can do we don't know how he's gonna do it and guess what he probably doesn't know how either
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:42:59.720]  but this is a successful businessman who knows how to delegate well he's just not out to get us if
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:03.720]  they just not out to get us and look who he chose for a vice president i mean look how he turned
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:08.360]  mexican president with one meeting for him because i know it was said little bird told me he said
[02:43:08.360 --> 02:43:12.440]  listen you've been screwed over by globalism let's come together let's make both our country's rich
[02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:17.240]  let's break this multinational collateral system that wants us poor he came out the Mexican president
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:21.880]  was glowing i mean that's all we need to do is have prosperity yes and the other thing is look at
[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:27.480]  his first big decision mike pence for p say what a fabulous guy we're gonna talk about that look how
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:34.360]  uh christie's about to get indicted we've got a former speaker again which is coming out against
[02:43:34.360 --> 02:43:40.440]  trump look how pence has been really a stalwart he didn't pick the right guy he picked an absolutely
[02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:47.640]  fabulous guy he's loyal well and he's he's bright he's articulate he's knowledgeable he is principled
[02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:54.440]  i met him and his wife in florida last month and i was very impressed with him with both of them i
[02:43:54.440 --> 02:44:00.360]  just think that this shows right up front trump's ability to pick the right people i'm not groveling
[02:44:00.360 --> 02:44:04.600]  it's not ever actually like this but i mean is trump not a god send i think so and you know i've
[02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:09.240]  i said uh i think it was in my sunday school i said you know for years a lot of us christians
[02:44:09.240 --> 02:44:14.040]  have been praying for our country praying praying praying and i believe god has a sense of humor and
[02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:20.360]  it may be donald trump is the answer to prayer he is not the person that any of us but look at the
[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:26.840]  bible it never was like that no it never was that's exactly it god always chooses interesting people
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:32.040]  and that's what we have here we we don't have the person who would be the stereotypical
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:37.640]  hero to come in and go to washington but what we have in washington is a cesspool
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:42.680]  and don't get me started on that with republicans try to get more into bill clinton more in your book
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:48.040]  but i want to get into this okay i mean it's in the emails they're out to get the average american
[02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:52.600]  they hate their black supporters they hate poor white supporters it's like they want to make you
[02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:57.400]  dependent then they disdain you when they make you dependent the nastiness of these emails there's
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:01.480]  so many thousands i can keep track how we're going to keep them dumb we're going to keep them poor
[02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:06.120]  we knew all this but reading this it's like how the hell do you write this and send it to somebody
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:11.160]  like i want to keep my employees poor i want poor people and i want them to meanwhile you're like
[02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:17.000]  i'm liberal oh you know it's just what the hell well i have a chapter in here in the book called
[02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:22.760]  the plantation mentality and that's why i say everything that's happening is in this book it's
[02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:29.800]  foreshadowed it's foretold it's explained the foundation it is it is all it's all in here
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:35.880]  because nothing has changed in 45 years and here's the thing you talk about something that's racist
[02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:40.440]  how about open borders how about letting all these people come in here who will work for
[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:45.480]  four dollars an hour what is that doing oh they're a permanent underclass exactly they're the new
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:50.120]  underclass be the bottom and then to bring us down that's right whereas i want to bring everybody up
[02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:55.080]  and african-americans and women and hispanics who are here legally are the ones who are going to be
[02:45:55.080 --> 02:45:59.080]  the most hurt by this open border saying not to mention the rest of us and then it doesn't bring
[02:45:59.080 --> 02:46:02.840]  the other countries up all this all the studies are done well they admit the plan is to drop down
[02:46:02.840 --> 02:46:08.680]  wages break us and why did mexico build a wall on its southern border oh i know once you're informed
[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:12.600]  it's all hypocrisy so looking at this then what does your gut tell you about the election because
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:16.120]  we have the internal polls i told people like three months ago and they said he was starting to lose
[02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:20.280]  he was 10 points ahead suddenly five points behind us it's all bull and it keeps coming out
[02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:25.000]  none of this is working he's he's way ahead hillary's panicking her internal emails show this
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:29.240]  they're suddenly homeland security comes in to save the election from the russians
[02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:34.680]  this is unprecedented if they try a coup in front of us of a landslide what does trump do
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:41.400]  because they're so mad he says he's gonna fight i hope he does and what i say is this alex hillary
[02:46:41.400 --> 02:46:50.600]  can not win this election now she may be able to steal it but she can not win it well i mean
[02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:56.200]  she has 200 people at her event she has 30 000 exactly i've been to some trump events oh my gosh
[02:46:56.200 --> 02:46:59.960]  and they're not just there the people are not just there they're it's like an arkansas razor
[02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:05.480]  bank football game they're they're all they're all around it's like a big camp out absolutely
[02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:09.080]  they're all excited and by the way it's people of every race color and creed which makes the media
[02:47:09.080 --> 02:47:16.280]  so mad yeah absolutely absolutely and the media coverage stinks and you know there's a chapter
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:22.120]  in here chapter 47 media magic or how to make a story disappear and i'll bet you that most people
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:29.240]  who are watching have no idea that i filed a riko lawsuit against billy clinton and his cohorts
[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:36.440]  back in what 1998 a federal riko law school lawsuit no one knows that you know why media magic
[02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:41.800]  how to make a story disappear and billy filed a motion in federal district court saying that he
[02:47:41.800 --> 02:47:47.160]  should not have to answer this case because he was a sitting president and the district court
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:52.520]  said sorry bubba you got to answer and he took it to the federal appeals court and they said the
[02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:56.280]  same thing we don't care if you're the sitting president this is a federal lawsuit you need
[02:47:56.280 --> 02:48:00.360]  to answer and he took it all the way to the united states supreme court and what do you think the
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:08.040]  supreme's ruled unanimously in my favor and then lisa meyer of nbc who did that fabulous intense
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:12.600]  interview with wanita broadrick about the rate called me and wanted to interview me on the steps
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:18.440]  of the federal courthouse in washington okay great lisa called me the night before and she said
[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:22.360]  dolly i'm sorry we have to cancel the interview in the morning that's how the executives kill it
[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:26.840]  they have a blockade on nanny williams his illegitimate son reportedly they have a media blockade
[02:48:26.840 --> 02:48:31.160]  and all this other stuff look at rogerport.com right now your tv viewer radio listeners can go
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:36.840]  there rogerport.com obama claimed executive privilege at hillary mess now we know it's come
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:41.400]  out in the emails they never told us he declared it but now it's confirmed the white house declared
[02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:48.120]  it he had a gnome to plume a fake name that's what the head of the you know epa had to step down for
[02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:52.840]  communicating with hillary working on all these deals outside of the freedom of information act
[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:59.560]  so they're running clandestine operations against this country meanwhile shock poll no sign of
[02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:05.640]  allegation fall out yet there's a whole bunch of polls this is raspussen though it's not hurting
[02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:12.680]  trump he's really way ahead so what does your gut tell you dolly kyle author of hillary the other
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:17.400]  woman what are they gonna pull is a smart lady that knows these people as constitutional lawyer
[02:49:17.400 --> 02:49:22.200]  been around a while what's your gut telling us i feel like 24 days out we are just hurtling towards
[02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:27.720]  disaster i mean these arrogant crazy disconnected hillary can hardly go downstairs she has seizures
[02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:33.800]  she's all whacked out she's got handlers sending emails about wet work you know scalia i mean we've
[02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:39.640]  entered the twilight zone don't they get we're not backing down they just don't know they're like a
[02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:46.120]  hundred ton freight train going up because of 500 ton freight train well alex the whole thing is
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:51.160]  mind-boggling because if you believe about the voting machines and the way they can be tampered
[02:49:51.160 --> 02:49:57.080]  and you'd believe that the ballots were you know already marched for hillary in a lot of places
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:50:01.240]  that's already happening in florida no it's confirmed okay and and look what happened to the
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:07.800]  ballots for bernie in california oh he clearly won stanford university absolutely he would have won
[02:50:07.800 --> 02:50:13.000]  so i don't know and i remember and i talk about this in the book because this was in hot springs
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:18.440]  in arkansas when i was a kid big time i mean they sold the ballot boxes at the end of the evening my
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:23.880]  mother was a uh what do you call it poll watcher and they asked her if she'd like to stay for the
[02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:28.520]  barbeque and the auction she said what auction they said at nine o'clock we auction off the ballot
[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:37.560]  boxes one precinct at a time hello and al capone you should sit right there uh at the what's that
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:42.680]  big uh famous hotel he was at the arlington they used the arlington fourth floor six well fourth
[02:50:42.680 --> 02:50:46.600]  or sixth whatever right there on the corner yeah yeah i've stayed in that room yeah and they would
[02:50:46.600 --> 02:50:50.840]  just auction everything off right there well al capone actually wasn't that was earlier that was
[02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:54.520]  earlier that was way earlier but i'm saying that the tradition started yeah and you know what some
[02:50:54.520 --> 02:51:00.280]  of my favorite chapters in here are about hot springs people love those it's good no you ever wonder

[02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:52.920]  tried to silence me on bill clinton's right but now they're saying they fear for their lives
[02:55:52.920 --> 02:56:00.280]  we got pades to talk about wet work in emails now before scalia dies okay so here it is you saw
[02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:12.600]  bill clinton weeks later yes that was still in this period of shock and wondering what had happened
[02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:18.360]  and how i could have been so stupid to have allowed something like that to happen still blaming
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:26.200]  yourself still blaming myself i'm just still blaming myself and i realized that i have information
[02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:31.880]  that needs to go back to the campaign because i had not returned to the volunteering at you know
[02:56:31.880 --> 02:56:38.680]  putting yard signs up asking for donations and things like that so i found about three to four
[02:56:38.680 --> 02:56:46.120]  checks to the clinton campaign they weren't but for 25 or 50 there were small checks and then uh
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:52.200]  some list of people who were still going to donate so i asked norma that was the lady that was with
[02:56:52.200 --> 02:56:57.080]  me at the time if she would run up to that event with me and i think she's the one that went with me
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:05.240]  and we went up there uh before long before the fundraiser was to happen this was a fundraiser
[02:57:05.240 --> 02:57:12.280]  in the home of a local dentist yes uh for bill clinton running for governor right did you know
[02:57:12.280 --> 02:57:17.560]  that he was going to come and that he was going to show up with hillary oh i'm sure that i knew that
[02:57:17.560 --> 02:57:23.000]  but that's why we went 30 minutes early so i could give the lady from little rock the checks
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:27.960]  and the list and then we were going to get out of there and they come in early from the kitchen
[02:57:27.960 --> 02:57:34.040]  area and uh just before they do they would be bill and hillary bill and hillary clinton
[02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:39.560]  and just before they do a gentleman who had driven them from the airport come straight over to me
[02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:46.040]  he was a very he was supporting clinton but he didn't know what had happened to me even though
[02:57:46.040 --> 02:57:52.520]  he was a friend and he said the topic of the conversation all the way from the airport was
[02:57:52.520 --> 02:57:59.480]  about you and that startled me and i knew i had to get out of there well just as he moved here
[02:57:59.480 --> 02:58:07.480]  comes hillary straight for me and starts gets to me and she starts saying i just want to thank you
[02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:13.960]  for everything you're doing in bill's campaign and it's so nice to meet you and all of these things
[02:58:13.960 --> 02:58:20.120]  so i just nodded and told my friend let's go and i thought somebody from behind had grabbed a hold
[02:58:20.120 --> 02:58:27.720]  of my arm but it was her she grabbed a hold of my arm and my hand and she pulls me into her
[02:58:28.280 --> 02:58:35.320]  and she says with this very angry look on her face which had been so pleasant seconds before
[02:58:35.320 --> 02:58:44.120]  and in a low voice says do you understand everything you do and they're fighting me
[02:58:48.520 --> 02:58:52.600]  it's not just our water we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned it's

[03:00:39.720 --> 03:00:45.400]  need to understand it here on the air today separately thoughts about this election i'm
[03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:50.760]  scared if i didn't have children and grandchildren probably might not bother me so much i'd just
[03:00:50.760 --> 03:00:57.960]  go live on an island somewhere but i have to say this my daddy was a united states marine
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:03.000]  when i was two years old he put me up in a very high swing and i was scared and i said oh daddy
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:12.120]  i'm scared i'm scared and he said marines get scared but we do it anyway and i'm not saying
[03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:18.040]  that i'm scared of the clintons i know what they do and i know who's got my six but i have to tell
[03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:22.760]  you that there's too many scared people out there hillary is a terrorist a terrorist achieves
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:27.880]  political aims through threats violence and intimidation she's been doing this for 45 years
[03:01:27.880 --> 03:01:32.840]  since she intimidated marla krider at the university of arkansas 1974 nothing has changed
[03:01:32.840 --> 03:01:39.480]  about that except the scope is bigger and worse and if you think that we are a bunch of conspiracy
[03:01:39.480 --> 03:01:45.960]  theorists well alex may be but i'm not i'm just telling you the absolute truth well you personally
[03:01:45.960 --> 03:01:51.400]  experienced are vicious and they attack different people different ways we know about kathleen willie
[03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:56.040]  and the missing cat and the threats against her children and sally miller threatened to break her
[03:01:56.040 --> 03:02:01.080]  legs they did something different with me they planted false stories about me in national publications
[03:02:01.080 --> 03:02:06.600]  and why did they do that because they knew i was an award-winning lawyer and my reputation
[03:02:06.600 --> 03:02:13.160]  was the most important thing to me what someone forgot was that i am so big on ethics and again
[03:02:13.160 --> 03:02:17.800]  i'm not a goody two shoes in my personal life don't get me wrong but as a lawyer by golly
[03:02:17.800 --> 03:02:23.320]  we're officers of the court we need to do things right and three weeks after i graduated from law
[03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:30.280]  school i quit my first job over an ethics issue and this is the most unethical the most ethically
[03:02:30.280 --> 03:02:35.800]  bankrupt person as i know has ever run for president of these united states and if we're
[03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:41.400]  going to save our united states we better hope to god that donald trump can help us do it because
[03:02:41.400 --> 03:02:47.320]  hillary clinton is going to take us to the dogs the only call and i mean i get the joke i don't
[03:02:47.320 --> 03:02:51.960]  mind it they just use this term like if i know they're going to take over the election i have
[03:02:51.960 --> 03:02:56.360]  sources i say look out there and take over the election the president has to respond says we won't
[03:02:56.360 --> 03:03:04.120]  two weeks later they do a conspiracy is two people or more deciding to work together to basically
[03:03:04.120 --> 03:03:09.000]  scam somebody in layman's terms we've been proven right about all this yes they just use the term
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:13.320]  conspiracy theory to shut down critics oh don't listen to them they're conspiracy theories exactly
[03:03:13.320 --> 03:03:19.080]  we don't listen to them but i look at the clinton's and the and the power structure behind them don't
[03:03:19.080 --> 03:03:24.040]  they get that their credibility is very low what i don't know that they do because they're pathological
[03:03:24.040 --> 03:03:30.600]  liars and pathological liars believe their own pr shall we call it um pathological liars can pass
[03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:35.880]  a line detector test because they believe it and again what i said about projection 101
[03:03:35.880 --> 03:03:40.680]  when hillary talks about a vast right-wing conspiracy hello it's because there's a fast
[03:03:40.680 --> 03:03:45.960]  left-wing conspiracy she is projecting that of course they have met everyone else and i was
[03:03:45.960 --> 03:03:50.120]  being facetious when i said that there are a lot of mind if i mean what makes hillary tick them
[03:03:50.120 --> 03:03:54.920]  from your law and psychological background i'm telling you as i said in the book she is addicted
[03:03:54.920 --> 03:04:01.480]  to power and money and more money to get more power and that's all it is and the reason she's a globalist
[03:04:01.480 --> 03:04:06.680]  is that she wants the united states of america to be absorbed into a global economy and she can
[03:04:06.680 --> 03:04:11.240]  be empress of the world not just president of the united states though is a pissing contest she
[03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:16.360]  wants to mount her head on the wall she absolutely does and she doesn't care about being president
[03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:20.840]  anymore than she cared about being a senator or being secretary of state if she cared about the
[03:04:20.840 --> 03:04:25.640]  job she would have made something happen she would have had a few accomplishments this is a woman
[03:04:25.640 --> 03:04:32.760]  with an empty resume i mean her time at the secretary of state's office besides the disaster
[03:04:32.760 --> 03:04:37.160]  she caused in north africa and in the middle of east otherwise it's just a travel log the
[03:04:37.160 --> 03:04:41.720]  woman traveled a million miles and did not do anything for the united states lawyer dolly co

[03:11:07.640 --> 03:11:13.160]  few dollars there instead of an amazon who actuaries is it all out from monopoly uh dolly kyle we've
[03:11:13.160 --> 03:11:18.040]  got 10 minutes left you've got the floor looking at camera four to address the public about knowing
[03:11:18.040 --> 03:11:25.240]  hillary and bill for so many years well 92 000 words in this book and i couldn't read a chapter
[03:11:25.240 --> 03:11:32.360]  in 10 minutes i really strongly advise everyone to get this book and read it because everything
[03:11:32.360 --> 03:11:38.040]  is in here and it's like a cheat sheet for you to know what's going on and what has always been
[03:11:38.040 --> 03:11:43.400]  going on with the clinton's chapter 46 is called the big problem and the big problem is that the
[03:11:43.400 --> 03:11:49.720]  problem is so big although this book is written in short chapters chapter 46 is 11 pages long because
[03:11:49.720 --> 03:11:55.640]  it is an alphabetical list of the scandals of the clinton's not explained just an alphabetical list
[03:11:55.640 --> 03:12:01.400]  of them you need to know that in chapter 47 the media magic how to make a story and you dedicate
[03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:07.560]  your book to victims of rape survivors survivors and there's a difference because there are a lot
[03:12:07.560 --> 03:12:12.760]  of people who are still victims of rape and sex abuse and i intend after this election to continue
[03:12:12.760 --> 03:12:18.360]  to talk about this because is a scourge on our country some people have survived some people
[03:12:18.360 --> 03:12:22.760]  are thriving some people have gotten healing and some people like billy and hillary have not
[03:12:22.760 --> 03:12:27.800]  gotten healing and they are projecting their problems onto the american public and ultimately
[03:12:27.800 --> 03:12:36.920]  to the world i want to say this i spent almost 10 years in dallas working in the low-income
[03:12:36.920 --> 03:12:44.200]  communities trying to help low-income homeowners with housing issues i got 350 volunteer real
[03:12:44.200 --> 03:12:50.600]  estate lawyers to work with us in this endeavor we worked with habitat for humanity and 50 other
[03:12:50.600 --> 03:12:57.080]  nonprofit organizations trying to get housing and i will tell you that african americans hispanics
[03:12:57.080 --> 03:13:04.600]  asians and white people who lived in the housing projects the ones i met wanted to get out they
[03:13:04.600 --> 03:13:11.160]  didn't want a bigger handout they wanted out and hillary it's not white flight you go out there
[03:13:11.160 --> 03:13:15.880]  people getting away from government away black white is spanning they're getting away from it
[03:13:15.880 --> 03:13:21.160]  they're running they there are a few people of course who are on welfare who want to sit there
[03:13:21.160 --> 03:13:25.640]  and watch tv and not do anything else but there are so many people who want jobs and that's what
[03:13:25.640 --> 03:13:30.680]  donald trump is talking about jobs and hillary she can flip one switch and do well hillary clinton
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:35.720]  talks about jobs and when she was running for the senate she said she would get 200 000 jobs for
[03:13:35.720 --> 03:13:39.960]  upstate new york now i have been in upstate new york a lot and i love the adirondacks in fact i
[03:13:39.960 --> 03:13:46.760]  was just there in july but guess what there's not 200 000 new jobs in upstate new york and first
[03:13:46.760 --> 03:13:54.200]  off it was a ridiculous thing to say but she still says it so what i would advise people to do is pay
[03:13:54.200 --> 03:14:00.600]  attention if hillary says something bad about donald trump that is projection it is about herself
[03:14:00.600 --> 03:14:08.120]  and if she says she accomplished something i hate to tell you she's lying she will claim that she
[03:14:08.120 --> 03:14:12.760]  got health care for children she's lying well it's even admitted that she like wrecks everything she
[03:14:12.760 --> 03:14:18.600]  touches why is that because she is incompetent she hates people so how can you hate people and get
[03:14:18.600 --> 03:14:24.120]  anything accomplished you need to work with people as i did with lawyers for affordable housing to get
[03:14:24.120 --> 03:14:32.360]  350 volunteer lawyers you think it's hard to run a company with 350 employees try 350 volunteers
[03:14:32.360 --> 03:14:39.880]  okay so you have to be able to work with people and she cannot do this she is racist and everything
[03:14:39.880 --> 03:14:44.440]  she says about racism is i was about to say her chefs are coming out not the one they killed but
[03:14:44.440 --> 03:14:48.680]  the other one is saying she's just screaming inward and that's what i heard about all this
[03:14:49.240 --> 03:14:52.360]  and then separately that they say one of the new wiki things they're gonna release
[03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:56.760]  is a tape of her just screaming and yelling and i've a lot of folks have told me
[03:14:56.760 --> 03:15:01.000]  did you ever hear do that or what was the word i never heard her personally do this what i heard
[03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:07.320]  was billy talk about the warden doing this and the warden was his uh shall we say pet name for his
[03:15:07.320 --> 03:15:12.280]  wife the warden so you kept you were friends with him or kept seeing him after he was married
[03:15:12.280 --> 03:15:19.640]  both both i mean here we go by the warden well the warden was hillary and when i maybe would go
[03:15:19.640 --> 03:15:24.760]  to see him at the governor's mansion uh one of the troopers would call and say the warden's not
[03:15:24.760 --> 03:15:31.400]  gone yet because they kind of picked up on it and they liked that too so everything that you read by
[03:15:31.960 --> 03:15:37.160]  former secret service former arkansas state police people talking about hillary and the way
[03:15:37.160 --> 03:15:43.320]  she is believe it people it is true and the thing of his is her actions are so egregious how could
[03:15:43.320 --> 03:15:48.920]  you believe it again the big problem is that the problem is so big who can wrap their minds around
[03:15:48.920 --> 03:15:54.520]  it except someone who grew up in hot springs or maybe chicago or new orleans but this is not
[03:15:54.520 --> 03:16:00.760]  normal for america and it's not the way the united states should be the clintons are trying to turn
[03:16:00.760 --> 03:16:06.280]  the united states into a third world country and speaking of third world countries look at haydie
[03:16:06.280 --> 03:16:11.720]  they stole millions and millions of dollars that was sent to the clinton foundation for the Haitians
[03:16:11.720 --> 03:16:18.760]  90 90 96 yeah and and the Haitians are picketing the clinton headquarters in new york is anyone
[03:16:18.760 --> 03:16:23.800]  covering that we just sent a cargo plane i haven't told listeners yet they're going to come back a
[03:16:23.800 --> 03:16:27.640]  couple days i want to blow all the shit they're about to take off the Haitians all hate the
[03:16:27.640 --> 03:16:32.520]  clintons they know they sold billions they're saying and we got government officials all of it
[03:16:32.520 --> 03:16:39.320]  i mean these people are crazy they are and it's it's mind boggling and it does sound a little
[03:16:39.320 --> 03:16:44.920]  bit crazy to talk about them because their actions are crazy so i agree we're not the crazy ones
[03:16:44.920 --> 03:16:49.960]  we're covering the crazy that's exactly right but it makes us sound crazy to talk about these people
[03:16:49.960 --> 03:16:59.000]  why would she have the the the crazy will to keep 96 97 it varies but she gave like three percent of
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:04.120]  the money they got for haydie how could you do that i mean i don't know i mean i think back to that
[03:17:04.760 --> 03:17:11.240]  comment was it uh henry ford someone said how much more money do you need or what is it you want
[03:17:11.240 --> 03:17:19.640]  and he says more more that's what the clintons want more you know why there is no end to an
[03:17:19.640 --> 03:17:26.600]  addict's need okay and donald trump when asked what was one of hillary's good traits was she's a
[03:17:26.600 --> 03:17:30.760]  fighter yeah she's a fighter look at her website see how many times she used the word fight that's
[03:17:30.760 --> 03:17:35.720]  all she knows how to do is fight she can't think she can't cooperate but even though america gives
[03:17:35.720 --> 03:17:44.200]  her all the power she hates this big animal she's riding she does she does and i hate to say it but
[03:17:44.200 --> 03:17:49.640]  i spent a lot of time in this book explaining that and if you understand the foundational problems
[03:17:49.640 --> 03:17:54.360]  that billy and hillary have then you can understand what they're doing well she does seem like a mental
[03:17:54.360 --> 03:18:00.520]  magic because when she talks about trump she goes my husband needs those she goes oh or he has a dark
[03:18:00.520 --> 03:18:06.280]  heart why does he do it to me she's not just acting she seems mentally ill well in chapter 50
[03:18:06.280 --> 03:18:11.160]  there's two main things in chapter 50 that i talk about one is the clinton truth suppression
[03:18:11.160 --> 03:18:18.280]  techniques which i got from dc dav martin um and they're on number one with me which is ignore me so
[03:18:18.280 --> 03:18:23.960]  if they ignore me i don't exist and it's not a problem but there's 17 truth suppression techniques
[03:18:23.960 --> 03:18:28.440]  that the clinton's use and you should know what they are one of them is wetworks yeah and then
[03:18:28.440 --> 03:18:34.120]  you'll have fun sort of spotting which one is killing people i'm not sure by number but you
[03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:39.320]  can order them like a hamburger or something anyway but the other part of chapter 50 that's so important
[03:18:39.320 --> 03:18:44.280]  is i talk about hillary's increasing cognitive impairment now remember i turned this book into
[03:18:44.280 --> 03:18:50.840]  the publisher march 15th so i was saying long before this was a big issue so how do you know about that
[03:18:51.720 --> 03:18:57.640]  observing her over the years and i just this morning was getting texts from a former clinton
[03:18:57.640 --> 03:19:03.240]  insider who said that he was really concerned about hillary because mentally and physically
[03:19:03.240 --> 03:19:07.800]  something is wrong with her i talk about her cognitive impairment in here and here's the deal
[03:19:07.800 --> 03:19:14.200]  i'm not a doctor you don't have to be a doctor if your grandmother or father or someone in your
[03:19:14.200 --> 03:19:18.360]  family might first have a convulsion at a restaurant you go you're carrying that's a convulsion like
[03:19:18.360 --> 03:19:23.960]  well okay you would go to web md or centers for disease control and look up the symptoms and figure
[03:19:23.960 --> 03:19:28.360]  out what's wrong right that's what i was having a convulsion you see it well exactly but that's
[03:19:28.360 --> 03:19:32.520]  what i did i list the symptoms of cognitive impairment from the centers for disease control
[03:19:32.520 --> 03:19:36.360]  website and then i say here's what hillary so what does that say about the elite that they
[03:19:36.360 --> 03:19:40.280]  were trying to put something with the epileptic brain they had already gone too far with her
[03:19:40.280 --> 03:19:45.480]  that's the problem there is no going back that's hold on skip the break we'll meet rob new live
[03:19:45.480 --> 03:19:48.520]  here because i want to have a few more minutes with you i mean listen i was full of secret
[03:19:48.520 --> 03:19:52.440]  service in clave one they said in the next few weeks was a month they took them up we're gonna
[03:19:52.440 --> 03:19:57.240]  get you info they said you got a special black ambulance it's got lift gates she's falling down
[03:19:57.240 --> 03:20:01.560]  every 20 30 minutes we don't know we think it's a brain tumor they won't tell us it's getting worse
[03:20:01.560 --> 03:20:05.720]  we don't know what's happening and she'll look totally like hell when she's having convulsions
[03:20:05.720 --> 03:20:10.040]  and better the next day so you see i don't have that family that's had epilepsy they're real bad
[03:20:10.040 --> 03:20:15.560]  one day and better after it but with her we talked to folks that are obviously hooked into what's
[03:20:15.560 --> 03:20:19.480]  happening in maryland the year she was in the hospital reportedly brain surgeries what is your
[03:20:19.480 --> 03:20:24.520]  info you know as a lawyer it's one of the new the clintons it's one of the state all this she has
[03:20:24.520 --> 03:20:30.920]  she's really you know degenerating fast well my doctorate is a jurist doctorate so i can't speak
[03:20:30.920 --> 03:20:37.640]  as i know i know this is a gut level you're saying but but at a gut level honestly as i said in the
[03:20:37.640 --> 03:20:44.360]  book sometimes i feel sorry for hillary i do she has spent her whole life running for this office
[03:20:44.360 --> 03:20:53.160]  this is the entire focus of her addiction however i do not admire it anymore than i admire a drug
[03:20:53.160 --> 03:20:58.760]  addict who gets up in the middle of the night and comes to break in my house to steal jewelry or
[03:20:58.760 --> 03:21:06.280]  anything else to sell to fix his habit she has sold the united states to fix her habit her addiction
[03:21:06.280 --> 03:21:11.080]  for power and money she was the she was the sell out the elites could find that's right to be the
[03:21:11.080 --> 03:21:16.440]  trader she's not right she's she's special and she's so traitor well she is and she has made this
[03:21:16.440 --> 03:21:22.600]  clear in her writings and in her speeches all along and i i'm sure you know about the hospital
[03:21:22.600 --> 03:21:28.840]  room on the fourth floor at chelsea's apart chelsea's apart let's talk about that well what we know is
[03:21:28.840 --> 03:21:35.080]  that chelsea lives in a building where each person owns the floor that they're on a ten million dollar
[03:21:35.080 --> 03:21:41.720]  facility right and chelsea doesn't care about money she says i wouldn't either if somebody
[03:21:41.720 --> 03:21:47.160]  were buying me a ten million dollar condo but on that same floor there is a medical facility where
[03:21:47.160 --> 03:21:54.680]  they did 40 electrical and plumbing improvements and i and it was a i don't know the name of it some
[03:21:54.680 --> 03:21:59.880]  medical health care no it's come out that's where she ran when she collapsed on september 11 right
[03:21:59.880 --> 03:22:04.760]  and the yeah and the woman who came out of the building was not surrounded by secret service
[03:22:04.760 --> 03:22:09.320]  or anyone else wasn't that interesting and i'm sorry from a female perspective the woman who
[03:22:09.320 --> 03:22:14.200]  came out of the building weighed 20 pounds less than the woman who walked in i'd love to get that
[03:22:14.200 --> 03:22:18.360]  weight reduction program but i don't think so yeah you're looking like you didn't know that
[03:22:19.320 --> 03:22:24.520]  no they said it was a body double well if if hillary walked out where were the secret service
[03:22:24.520 --> 03:22:30.600]  people who are always around all around her and then all i know is i was told about the
[03:22:30.600 --> 03:22:34.680]  secret service she's falling down every 30 minutes and we have it on tape they said just go to her
[03:22:34.680 --> 03:22:39.240]  bench she's in a medical tent she's like on death's doorstep or something the word i have from high
[03:22:39.240 --> 03:22:45.080]  level yeah dr c picinic and others and he was like cia section chief of stuff you name it she's
[03:22:45.080 --> 03:22:49.320]  got a big fat brain tumor it's gone back i don't know what she has but here's the thing whatever
[03:22:49.320 --> 03:22:53.960]  she took how did she make it through those debates she looked great no she looked like hell then
[03:22:53.960 --> 03:22:58.360]  suddenly disappeared for a week she was there she was okay yeah yeah i thought great compared to how
[03:22:58.360 --> 03:23:01.880]  she looked before she looked great compared to the way she looked before now she was scripted it

[03:26:42.760 --> 03:26:46.440]  donald trump uh these women coming forth saying oh donald trump did this to me donald trump did
[03:26:46.440 --> 03:26:51.080]  that to me nobody really cares but this article here from the federalist it's on drudge it's red
[03:26:51.080 --> 03:26:56.440]  linked on drudge in the center column boat fraud is real here's the proof data suggests millions
[03:26:56.440 --> 03:27:03.400]  of voter registrations are fraudulent or invalid and that's enough to tip an election easily yeah if
[03:27:03.400 --> 03:27:11.640]  you got 15 million people what about 18 million people there's in this article they go over 18
[03:27:11.640 --> 03:27:18.200]  million invalid voter registrations on the books and that's back in 2012 when the peer research
[03:27:18.200 --> 03:27:22.520]  center did a report and they had found one in eight voter registrations are significantly
[03:27:22.520 --> 03:27:29.240]  inaccurate or no longer valid and what do we see from james o'keith he had one of his uh one of his
[03:27:29.240 --> 03:27:35.000]  associates working for the hillary clinton campaign asking hey i threw away some donald trump
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:40.120]  uh voter registrations is that cool they're republicans yeah man that's cool um you know
[03:27:40.120 --> 03:27:45.240]  don't do it again and we got this guy uh they interviewed one of these commissioners he said oh
[03:27:45.240 --> 03:27:50.920]  yeah they bust people around they go from poll site to poll site i mean but yet there's no voter
[03:27:50.920 --> 03:27:55.640]  fraud and and he asked obama he was like what are you talking about we're just gonna have the dhs
[03:27:55.640 --> 03:27:59.960]  take over the elections because we gotta we gotta install hillary because nobody's gonna vote for
[03:28:01.880 --> 03:28:06.600]  well it's funny is you look at these uh rallies nobody goes to the bill clinton rallies they're
[03:28:06.600 --> 03:28:11.000]  small nobody really goes to the hillary rallies people love to go see obama they were crazy at
[03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:16.600]  this rally and i got a text from somebody today that said they they interrupted with the uh
[03:28:17.320 --> 03:28:23.400]  bill clinton's a rapist protest and i'm waiting to see the video so that was uh obama in cleveland
[03:28:23.400 --> 03:28:28.360]  ohio today during that rally if you've got your video put it up on your youtube send it to me
[03:28:28.360 --> 03:28:32.920]  rob d at info wars dot com during this uh three minute break coming up i'm going to go check my
[03:28:32.920 --> 03:28:38.760]  email if you have any and um you know let me know if you got any anything after let's get back to
[03:28:38.760 --> 03:28:44.040]  this article voter fraud is real here's the proof in colorado they found multiple instances of dead
[03:28:44.040 --> 03:28:49.800]  people attempting to vote a woman named sarah so sosa who died in 2009 cast ballots in 2010
[03:28:49.800 --> 03:28:55.000]  11 12 and 13 and virginia was found that nearly 20 voter applications were turned in under names
[03:28:55.000 --> 03:29:01.080]  dead people that's only 20 that's not a big deal and right not a big deal uh texas they have this
[03:29:01.080 --> 03:29:06.520]  thing called vote harvesting where they procure signatures of of people and then they harvest
[03:29:06.520 --> 03:29:13.640]  them and then they go and turn them in and vote under their names crazy so if looking at that pure
[03:29:13.640 --> 03:29:21.720]  research center um study back in 2012 back then it was one and eight were inaccurate there's 146
[03:29:21.720 --> 03:29:27.880]  million people registered to vote that's 18 million invalid voter registrations 1.8 of those 1.8 million
[03:29:27.880 --> 03:29:36.200]  of those are dead people 2.75 million are registered in more than one state but hey obama says what are
[03:29:36.200 --> 03:29:40.920]  you talking about voter fraud is not a big deal we're gonna more at this and your calls 800 259

[03:30:28.280 --> 03:30:34.920]  clandestine financial and logistic support to isis but wait a minute if those governments support
[03:30:34.920 --> 03:30:40.440]  terrorists then why would hillary clinton accept money from them well they don't call her crooked

[03:33:29.560 --> 03:33:37.880]  youth dang it's a good those are the days when times were simpler right we were all young and
[03:33:38.920 --> 03:33:43.240]  we thought the government was here to help us or actually reagan wanted us that the government
[03:33:43.240 --> 03:33:49.240]  was here to help us that was the most frightening thing you'd ever hear but back then what was the
[03:33:49.240 --> 03:33:54.840]  government doing they're running drugs to to aid rebels in south american countries and
[03:33:55.880 --> 03:34:02.040]  hey you know you think that's all they've been doing that's right hillary's no different
[03:34:05.160 --> 03:34:11.080]  here's an article from steve watson today trump hillary meets in secret with international banks
[03:34:11.080 --> 03:34:16.360]  to plot destruction of us sovereignty donald trump delivered a keynote speech flaming the
[03:34:16.360 --> 03:34:20.200]  mainstream media for being in bed with hillary clinton's campaign and highlighting that hillary
[03:34:20.200 --> 03:34:28.920]  has been abusing her position to court globalist special interest for years and that brings me
[03:34:28.920 --> 03:34:32.840]  i'm going to go to steve in canada he's a caller i got a lot of callers lined up so i'm gonna go to
[03:34:32.840 --> 03:34:36.360]  he wants to talk about the bill clinton rapist media spin since we're talking about
[03:34:36.360 --> 03:34:41.000]  about the corporate media is no longer involved in journalism they're afraid to report these things
[03:34:41.560 --> 03:34:47.640]  steve what are you hearing in canada well i actually i just turned off my radio i i
[03:34:47.640 --> 03:34:53.240]  got off from work and i was listening to the local news and they talked about how there was this
[03:34:53.240 --> 03:34:59.400]  rally with obama and you know how there was someone screaming bill clinton's or rapist and i
[03:34:59.400 --> 03:35:04.440]  know i kind of got a chuckle out of it and was like great good to see that someone's uh you know
[03:35:04.440 --> 03:35:11.400]  i hope you're in the car but then right after they finished saying that they also proceeded to say
[03:35:11.400 --> 03:35:18.920]  that that person was there paid so just wanted to give you a little bit of a scoop on what the
[03:35:18.920 --> 03:35:24.520]  canadian media is spinning on that yeah rachel madow i think said the same thing that this
[03:35:24.520 --> 03:35:28.840]  isn't grassroots this is being funded by the republican party it's not being funded by the
[03:35:28.840 --> 03:35:34.200]  republican party um alex jones called for people if they want to go out and do this that he would
[03:35:34.200 --> 03:35:40.040]  pay them after the fact if they got we have to see the video it has to be live because then they
[03:35:40.040 --> 03:35:45.320]  can't censor it and that doesn't mean on your cell phone that means live media going out to people
[03:35:45.960 --> 03:35:49.720]  because they're they're holding all these events these are all live they're being streamed live
[03:35:49.720 --> 03:35:55.080]  they're being televised live and so when you get down and do that you're able to break the
[03:35:55.080 --> 03:35:58.600]  conditioning the paradigm you're able to break people from their trance because it's not something
[03:35:58.600 --> 03:36:03.560]  it's not like we're watching obama speak and all of a sudden somebody or there was one of this
[03:36:03.560 --> 03:36:08.120]  couple that jumped out and they'd made their bill clint as a rapist shirts and they ripped them off
[03:36:08.120 --> 03:36:13.720]  and started showing everybody and screaming it at first i think the guy did it and then the girl
[03:36:13.720 --> 03:36:21.320]  did it awesome you know breaking the conditioning it could be anything though it could be in the fed
[03:36:21.320 --> 03:36:25.000]  what if we had people doing that in the fed after this campaign's over we know we really
[03:36:25.000 --> 03:36:29.640]  got to look at what the federal reserve is doing because um i think it just came out
[03:36:29.640 --> 03:36:35.560]  out yeah this is from business insider red alert get ready for severe fall in the stock market
[03:36:35.560 --> 03:36:42.360]  hsbc says so the technical analysis team is starting up the ultimate warning signal
[03:36:43.000 --> 03:36:49.560]  and a note to clients release wednesday murray gun head technical analysis and now analyst for
[03:36:49.560 --> 03:36:56.280]  hsbc so there's a red alert so there's an intimate imminent sell off of stock sorry guys i didn't
[03:36:56.280 --> 03:37:01.960]  mean to block that um and they call it the elliot wave principle alternating patterns in the stock
[03:37:01.960 --> 03:37:06.680]  market to disconcern investors behavior i don't know i'm not into that i don't put my money in
[03:37:06.680 --> 03:37:12.280]  the stock market because it's a fake it's a rig system it's like a casino literally as a casino
[03:37:12.280 --> 03:37:19.160]  the house always wins and the house is giant insider bankers and billionaires who fund the
[03:37:19.160 --> 03:37:23.240]  market then the government props it up steve thanks for calling thanks for giving us that tidbit
[03:37:23.240 --> 03:37:29.080]  of information no nobody's being paid to be there they only get paid if they get on camera
[03:37:29.080 --> 03:37:34.920]  or if we hear them and it goes out live it's the only way people get paid and that contest is
[03:37:34.920 --> 03:37:38.680]  capped at a hundred thousand dollars and hopefully people people keep doing it after the hundred
[03:37:38.680 --> 03:37:44.200]  thousand dollars is met so while we talk about hillary and her collusion with the mainstream
[03:37:44.200 --> 03:37:49.800]  media let's go to a port from john bound about that very same subject let's go to it now what
[03:37:49.800 --> 03:38:01.880]  is your guilty pleasure uh let's see um are there that many well i'm just trying to think of you
[03:38:01.880 --> 03:38:08.200]  know the g-rated ones no years ago if you were an attractive female unfortunate enough to be within
[03:38:08.200 --> 03:38:13.400]  the circle of sexual predator bill clinton you would eventually find yourself escorted to a
[03:38:13.400 --> 03:38:18.600]  hotel room by an arkansas state trooper where the former governor would meet you wearing nothing but
[03:38:18.600 --> 03:38:24.840]  a creepy smile demanding you perform a sex act on it just asked paula jones she settled a case with
[03:38:24.840 --> 03:38:29.960]  bill clinton for the same reasons with an eight hundred and fifty thousand dollar payout other
[03:38:29.960 --> 03:38:35.240]  women have come forward with identical stories here's an inebriated bill clinton during his
[03:38:35.240 --> 03:38:41.160]  1992 presidential campaign groping a flight attendant bill clinton on the same flight later
[03:38:41.160 --> 03:38:46.680]  exposed himself and grabbed flight attendant christie zurcher's breasts after asking her to
[03:38:46.680 --> 03:38:52.600]  perform a sex act on him she was later threatened by white house attorney bruce lindsay to keep quiet
[03:38:52.600 --> 03:38:58.280]  that is the behavior that has been super imposed onto donald trump by the mainstream media the woman
[03:38:58.280 --> 03:39:04.440]  at the center of that explosive tape is now speaking out said there is no room for objectification
[03:39:04.440 --> 03:39:09.800]  of women or anyone for that matter not even in the locker room it's it's a crime i mean i prosecuted
[03:39:09.800 --> 03:39:15.240]  sex crimes that's a sexual assault classic sexual assault people go to jail for that he wants hillary
[03:39:15.240 --> 03:39:22.520]  clinton to go to jail maybe he needs to go to jail hillary clinton is on the stage hillary clinton
[03:39:22.520 --> 03:39:28.600]  is running for president not her husband um this makes sense this is politically uh incorrect what
[03:39:28.600 --> 03:39:34.200]  donald trump did this is bringing a whole nother level level of gutter that's rape culture can't
[03:39:34.200 --> 03:39:39.400]  forget blaming someone who succumbed to someone committing adultery on her she was accused of
[03:39:39.400 --> 03:39:43.880]  facilitating it last night and she was definitely and you're wrong she did not deny it but you know
[03:39:43.880 --> 03:39:49.400]  why because it's being ridiculous doing it's so ridiculous bill's secretive behavior continued
[03:39:49.400 --> 03:39:54.920]  until monica lewinsky blew it wide open all the while hillary clinton served as an attack dog
[03:39:54.920 --> 03:40:01.000]  threatening the victims clearing the path on her and bill's luciferian bonnie and clad trojan horse
[03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:07.560]  to the upper echelons of power and wealth now all anyone has to do to be mind raped by the clinton
[03:40:07.560 --> 03:40:14.040]  crime machine is to turn on any cable news network let's start with what people described as trump
[03:40:14.040 --> 03:40:19.560]  sort of hovering and lurking the last 10 days could have been about nothing but emails nothing
[03:40:19.560 --> 03:40:25.320]  but negatives about hillary clinton but there's donald trump the use of propaganda is exploding
[03:40:25.320 --> 03:40:32.280]  after being legalized in 2013 while america slept an amendment overturned the long-standing smith
[03:40:32.280 --> 03:40:39.160]  mont act of 1948 and the foreign relations authorization act of 1987 allowing for materials
[03:40:39.160 --> 03:40:44.920]  produced by the state department and the broadcasting board of governors to be released within us
[03:40:44.920 --> 03:40:51.160]  borders michael hastings of buzzfeed.com put it this way the new law would give sweeping powers to
[03:40:51.160 --> 03:40:56.760]  the state department and pentagon to push television radio newspaper and social media
[03:40:56.760 --> 03:41:02.840]  on to the u.s. public it removes the protection for americans says a pentagon official who is
[03:41:02.840 --> 03:41:08.520]  concerned about the law it removes oversight from the people who want to put out this information
[03:41:08.520 --> 03:41:14.040]  there are no checks and balances no one knows if the information is accurate partially accurate
[03:41:14.040 --> 03:41:21.240]  or entirely false cnn's jeff zucker just ordered an all-out blackout on the reporting of bill clinton's
[03:41:21.240 --> 03:41:28.600]  illegitimate son that's propaganda in a nutshell true journalism should have zero bias but in true
[03:41:28.600 --> 03:41:34.280]  dualistic fashion the faceless people actually concerned about the future of the republic
[03:41:34.280 --> 03:41:37.720]  are the ones being attacked by the criminals running the show
[03:41:37.720 --> 03:41:51.640]  you can put half of trump supporters into what i call the basket of deplorables
[03:41:52.360 --> 03:42:00.600]  the racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamophobic you name it the other guy's base
[03:42:00.600 --> 03:42:10.600]  is what i grew up in you know i'm basically your standard redneck no doubt about it the american
[03:42:10.600 --> 03:42:16.360]  consciousness might as well be in a little rock arkansas hotel room right now with arkansas state
[03:42:16.360 --> 03:42:21.480]  troopers guarding the door while all the hopes and dreams of the american ideal are brutally
[03:42:21.480 --> 03:42:26.760]  raped inside by the clinton crime machine the bush dynasty and the descendants of the robber
[03:42:26.760 --> 03:42:33.320]  barons who continue to stalk and brainwash the good people of the united states with unyielding
[03:42:33.320 --> 03:42:45.800]  criminal intent john bound for enforce dot com it is one of the great political phenomenons the
[03:42:45.800 --> 03:42:51.560]  most powerful weapon deployed by the clinton's is the corporate media the press trump noted
[03:42:51.560 --> 03:42:56.760]  the latest wiki leaks revelations have outed even more collusion between the new york times and
[03:42:56.760 --> 03:43:00.440]  hillary the emails reveal that hillary is warned before the newspaper runs a story that could be
[03:43:00.440 --> 03:43:05.480]  negative towards her and she has a chance to veto anything she likes in addition an email sent
[03:43:05.480 --> 03:43:10.840]  by hillary's traveling press secretary nick merrill outlines how maggie habermann a writer for
[03:43:10.840 --> 03:43:15.560]  politico and the new york times helps tee up stories that are beneficial to hillary clinton
[03:43:15.560 --> 03:43:22.040]  now just imagine if the corporate media is helping hillary clinton get into office by
[03:43:22.600 --> 03:43:27.160]  hiding stories that are negative towards her and teeing up stories that are beneficial towards her
[03:43:28.040 --> 03:43:31.320]  what do you think they're going to do when she gets into office if they're going to stop
[03:43:32.600 --> 03:43:38.200]  no they're going to continue okay it's just like when fox news is doing this for bush
[03:43:38.200 --> 03:43:41.960]  if you're like look at that media covering for bush it's the same thing that's going to happen
[03:43:41.960 --> 03:43:50.280]  but this time it's going to be times a million you're going to have mbc abc cbs cnn all of them
[03:43:50.840 --> 03:43:55.960]  wrapping their little hands around your necks and putting evil lies on television
[03:43:57.000 --> 03:43:59.560]  let's go to chris in virginia let's talk about election fraud because that's the
[03:43:59.560 --> 03:44:04.440]  two pronged attack you're going to have you got to have people screw in with the election
[03:44:04.440 --> 03:44:09.720]  and then you have to have the media help covering it up go ahead chris i'm here in virginia and i
[03:44:09.720 --> 03:44:15.960]  think uh it's crazy how in harrison burger got all these uh dead voters signing up and i think
[03:44:15.960 --> 03:44:23.400]  virginia is going to be a big swing state for watching out for election fraud so i hope that
[03:44:23.400 --> 03:44:29.400]  people will finally wake up and decide we don't want world war three it's just as simple as that
[03:44:29.400 --> 03:44:35.240]  yeah and the elephant in the room is you got two kinds of elite you got the ones that want the money
[03:44:35.240 --> 03:44:41.000]  and you they want the power but the ones above them they believe in satan so they just want
[03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:45.080]  hell on earth because they think they're going to be gods in the new world but what they don't
[03:44:45.080 --> 03:44:51.000]  understand is we're all going to die yeah they think they're removed from it and they and they'll
[03:44:51.000 --> 03:44:55.720]  get away with it and they'll be fine in their little area they're not going to be fine anything
[03:44:55.720 --> 03:44:59.560]  happens in any type of armageddon scenario the first place people are going to go is they're
[03:44:59.560 --> 03:45:03.160]  going to go where they they know where the rich people are because they've been stocking things up
[03:45:03.160 --> 03:45:12.040]  up and there is a lot of retired special forces people in this country and they're not on whose
[03:45:12.040 --> 03:45:16.600]  side they're on but they're not going to be on the elite side i know that so thanks for calling
[03:45:16.600 --> 03:45:21.640]  chris let's go to james in texas let's talk about obama's executive order for the next 120 days go
[03:45:21.640 --> 03:45:29.080]  ahead james hello um i just wanted to talk about uh if everyone goes to the white house dot gov the
[03:45:29.080 --> 03:45:35.320]  official website and goes to the executive orders that are almost fishing out every day now um just
[03:45:35.320 --> 03:45:43.880]  recently in coordination with uh he just did uh just put out an executive order titled coordinating
[03:45:43.880 --> 03:45:48.600]  efforts to prepare the nation for space weather events now i don't know if you knew this but
[03:45:48.600 --> 03:45:56.920]  a few days back um there was some solar flares that uh nasa deemed uh credible threats to this
[03:45:56.920 --> 03:46:04.280]  our power grid that could possibly shut down our uh entire world's power for months at a time so i
[03:46:04.280 --> 03:46:11.880]  was reading a little bit into this this little uh thing that i signed and in section four uh subsection
[03:46:11.880 --> 03:46:18.920]  e uh paragraph two it says they uh have the right to coordinate response and recovery from the effects
[03:46:18.920 --> 03:46:24.680]  of space weather events on critical infrastructure and the broader community now that can be interpreted
[03:46:24.680 --> 03:46:30.600]  different ways but to me that sounds like they can implement martial law what we're gonna do
[03:46:30.600 --> 03:46:37.560]  is everything is the broader community yeah the broader community has a curfew yeah that's exactly
[03:46:37.560 --> 03:46:41.400]  what's gonna happen i love how it's just loosely worded like that the broader community did they
[03:46:41.400 --> 03:46:44.920]  even put a definition for the broader community in there usually they put definitions for everything
[03:46:45.800 --> 03:46:51.720]  no they don't they just go on to the next section which is f so yeah you know nothing's
[03:46:51.720 --> 03:46:56.360]  really described interestingly enough you you should be prepared if your power goes out you
[03:46:56.360 --> 03:47:01.720]  should have a generator uh you should have solar mm-hmm i've got both we actually right now we have
[03:47:01.720 --> 03:47:08.200]  the info wars solar base station power supply on sale now 33 off it is time to get prepared if you
[03:47:08.200 --> 03:47:12.680]  don't storeable food you know water filtration people i'm talking to everybody not just you
[03:47:12.680 --> 03:47:19.880]  james everybody needs to get prepared everybody needs to get prepared because if the stock market
[03:47:19.880 --> 03:47:27.640]  comes goes down and they want to distract people they might start another war some natural space
[03:47:27.640 --> 03:47:32.680]  disaster happens oh nothing that we can see but all of a sudden the power goes out across the
[03:47:32.680 --> 03:47:37.160]  united states maybe on election day you know i think they're going to pull out all the stops at
[03:47:37.160 --> 03:47:41.480]  this point so you got to be prepared so you can concentrate on what's going on around you not
[03:47:41.480 --> 03:47:49.080]  worrying about gathering supplies also you got to be to get to stay healthy you got to get your
[03:47:49.080 --> 03:47:53.720]  sleep so we have knockout sleep support 25 off it's a flash sale going on right now and we're

[03:50:19.880 --> 03:50:26.520]  him and he's an mbc reporter and i actually met him in um wisconsin when we were there
[03:50:27.160 --> 03:50:33.320]  and i could tell he's not a trump supporter at all so he probably does not like that nice guy but

[03:54:40.920 --> 03:54:48.360]  in new bedford massachusetts they somebody took a picture of a sign on the on the highway that
[03:54:48.360 --> 03:54:53.880]  somebody must have hacked that says hillary for prison and it was locally in your area down the road
[03:54:54.760 --> 03:54:59.480]  yeah it's like basically the town right next to me okay right on my the highway goes through my city
[03:54:59.480 --> 03:55:05.960]  so all right and there was another one further down the road that said vote for trump and the
[03:55:05.960 --> 03:55:13.080]  state police the state police are investigating it to see how or who did this so i thought maybe
[03:55:13.080 --> 03:55:18.760]  they should investigate voter fraud in their area uh hey what's the name of the radio station uh it's
[03:55:18.760 --> 03:55:25.880]  fun 107 it's uh i believe it's located in fray haven massachusetts all right excellent thank you for

[03:55:58.040 --> 03:56:05.240]  in the jackets it's a secret service we're doing this project for the president and what got me was
[03:56:05.240 --> 03:56:14.440]  they're building 13 blast proof they're like 10 by 30 or 24 boxes that roll up on mac trucks
[03:56:15.400 --> 03:56:21.080]  and are being told to the guys who are manufacturing this these things move around and go where the
[03:56:21.080 --> 03:56:27.800]  president goes and me and my friend the reason i was reluctant to talk about it was it's kind of
[03:56:27.800 --> 03:56:35.160]  a little scary topic but on the other hand it why would a president who's leaving office be purchasing
[03:56:35.160 --> 03:56:44.920]  13 containers that are designed to go on and off of uh c 130s and this whole contract is huge and
[03:56:45.960 --> 03:56:56.600]  it's startling with all the hype and i heard alex say you know um basically um oh gosh uh
[03:56:56.600 --> 03:57:03.320]  scorched earth and when he said that it just resonates with me that i don't believe with
[03:57:03.320 --> 03:57:10.760]  what i saw i have images of it as well um good god this guy's leaving i don't think he's leaving
[03:57:11.400 --> 03:57:17.240]  i really don't rob i can't put it together i've tried to rationalize this you guys were here in
