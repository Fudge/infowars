[00:00.000 --> 00:04.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.740 --> 00:30.740]  Gavin McInnis, Joe Biggs, Miley Unopolis, and Soph, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:30.740 --> 01:00.180]  On this Friday, October 18, 2019, global transmission, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00.180 --> 01:05.740]  We have unbelievably important developments with the neocon establishment joining the
[01:05.740 --> 01:11.380]  leftist establishment and saying Trump must be removed, especially after the peace deal
[01:11.380 --> 01:18.220]  has been signed in Syria.
[01:18.220 --> 01:23.180]  And Trump's great crime is, he is not for endless wars, and he's actually fulfilling
[01:23.180 --> 01:31.080]  his campaign promises, they are definitely trying to remove the president right now.
[01:31.080 --> 01:35.700]  And we have to talk about the aftermath of what will happen if they're able to successfully
[01:35.700 --> 01:36.700]  remove him.
[01:36.700 --> 01:42.740]  A lot of nationalistic conservatives and Christians and libertarians think that President Trump
[01:42.740 --> 01:45.500]  is invincible.
[01:45.500 --> 01:48.300]  And I tell you, if you believe that, I think you're living in a bubble.
[01:48.300 --> 01:51.380]  We're going to open the phones up on that subject today.
[01:51.380 --> 01:56.780]  And I understand why Matt Drudge is running a lot of stories that show Trump in danger
[01:56.780 --> 01:59.340]  because Trump is in danger.
[01:59.340 --> 02:04.420]  And I think Matt Drudge is showing really what's going on on the ground.
[02:04.420 --> 02:14.460]  A lot of conservatives live in their own bubble, not as much as leftists do.
[02:14.460 --> 02:22.260]  They live in an insane asylum bubble, but they do live in their own bubble.
[02:22.260 --> 02:26.660]  And you need to get outside of that bubble sometimes, and I know our listeners do.
[02:26.660 --> 02:31.220]  That's why we're activist, nationalist, Christian patriots, most of us, or just other folks
[02:31.220 --> 02:33.500]  that are libertarians want to be free, common sense folks.
[02:33.500 --> 02:37.580]  I'm not saying somebody's bad out there, they don't believe in God, that's your issue.
[02:37.580 --> 02:43.500]  But the globalists are at war with the real Americana ethos, that's a mix of Renaissance,
[02:43.500 --> 02:47.780]  Christianity, swashbuckling, free-booting, Wild Wild West.
[02:47.780 --> 02:52.620]  And it's very romantic what America really stands for, individuals standing on their
[02:52.620 --> 02:58.580]  own and really finding their true grit.
[02:58.580 --> 03:02.420]  And that's the antithesis of the New World Order model of domestication in a post-human
[03:02.420 --> 03:03.420]  world.
[03:03.420 --> 03:09.860]  So I think that denying to ourselves just how dire the straits are is dangerous because
[03:09.860 --> 03:16.380]  I've been persecuted massively for supporting Trump.
[03:16.380 --> 03:20.820]  I went from having an audience bigger than Rush Limbaugh, conservatively bigger, I mean
[03:20.820 --> 03:25.580]  way bigger, and bringing in more money than Rush Limbaugh does, that's why I was able
[03:25.580 --> 03:26.780]  to build this infrastructure.
[03:26.780 --> 03:31.780]  Nothing against Rush having a big $20 million jet or a $10 million house, that's fine, that's
[03:31.780 --> 03:33.060]  he spent his money on that.
[03:33.060 --> 03:37.140]  I spent the money on the crew and infrastructure, and that's my reason we're still on air.
[03:37.140 --> 03:41.380]  And when everybody else would be taken completely off by this level of attack, it's because
[03:41.380 --> 03:43.420]  we were preparing for this.
[03:43.420 --> 03:45.580]  We didn't want this to happen, but we knew it was probably coming.
[03:45.580 --> 03:49.540]  If we were effective in rebooting America, there'd be a counter-offensive.
[03:49.540 --> 03:55.980]  So what I'm getting at is, I've supported Trump because I know he's for real and I
[03:55.980 --> 03:59.180]  know he wants to reboot the nation.
[03:59.180 --> 04:03.060]  But he's got the power to stop the censorship that's racketeering election meddling.
[04:03.060 --> 04:11.060]  He's got the power to go after the deep state, and really, his rhetoric is basically perfect.
[04:11.060 --> 04:16.380]  I give about a 99, and his action is about a 90.
[04:16.380 --> 04:20.220]  I mean, when you talk about pulling us out of these wars and trying to re-root the economy
[04:20.220 --> 04:23.300]  and trying to build the wall, they built quite a bit of it that War Patrol asked them to
[04:23.300 --> 04:28.340]  replace the hundreds of miles that was basically Swiss cheese, like an old shot-up road sign.
[04:28.340 --> 04:32.660]  You know, if somebody shot up 100 road signs in the town and money got funded for new road
[04:32.660 --> 04:36.460]  signs and they replaced the ones that were shot up, you wouldn't say, oh, the county
[04:36.460 --> 04:37.460]  robbed everybody.
[04:37.460 --> 04:41.180]  They didn't replace one new sign, because they replaced the hundred plus that were shot
[04:41.180 --> 04:42.180]  by shotguns.
[04:42.180 --> 04:48.340]  I mean, so I want to defend Trump, but he's in that position where he could really devastate
[04:48.340 --> 04:50.620]  them if he took a few more steps.
[04:50.620 --> 04:55.060]  And I think he is too confident in himself as well, and I think you could really say
[04:55.060 --> 04:58.380]  Matt Drudge pushed him over the top, so I think that's one reason Drudge has been somewhat
[04:58.380 --> 05:05.620]  critical is to get Trump out of his confidence position he's in and to realize just how perilous
[05:05.620 --> 05:09.540]  this is, especially for those of us that have been supporting him.
[05:09.540 --> 05:14.260]  Communist China quietly bought up Hollywood more than a decade ago, and they've been approving
[05:14.260 --> 05:19.660]  almost all the scripts that you see on television or in the movies for many years.
[05:19.660 --> 05:24.100]  And now they own our debt, now they own the Democratic Party, now they've merged Silicon
[05:24.100 --> 05:29.900]  Valley to censor patriots off the air, Washington Post comes out and says they hope that Gigi
[05:29.900 --> 05:33.060]  Ping, the dictator of China will, quote, destroy Trump.
[05:33.060 --> 05:34.060]  That's a headline.
[05:34.060 --> 05:38.260]  So Info Wars has been the Paul Revere of this operation.
[05:38.260 --> 05:42.740]  We have blown the whistle continuously and have been proven right, and that's why it's
[05:42.740 --> 05:47.100]  more important than ever that we override Silicon Valley and their Chai Kong masters
[05:47.100 --> 05:52.300]  by word of mouth and spread the word about Info Wars and check out infowarstore.com.
[05:52.300 --> 05:56.380]  That's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded, that's where the tip of the
[05:56.380 --> 06:26.340]  spear is continually being forged is infowarstore.com.
[06:26.340 --> 06:53.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this October 18, 2019, Friday edition.
[06:53.860 --> 07:03.500]  I'm your host Alex Jones, and I am going to open the phones up throughout the four hour
[07:03.500 --> 07:05.060]  transmission today.
[07:05.060 --> 07:11.060]  I have cleared the decks of guests, you may get a few guests on briefly that were at the
[07:11.060 --> 07:16.260]  big Trump rally in Dallas last night because they're eyewitnesses to a lot of what transpired
[07:16.260 --> 07:17.260]  and went on.
[07:17.260 --> 07:19.340]  It was a circus.
[07:19.340 --> 07:25.420]  And I was there, I did not even intend to be driving around an armored vehicle with
[07:25.420 --> 07:33.580]  a turret on the top, but the security group we were able to get through our contacts,
[07:33.580 --> 07:38.100]  great folks, had that armored vehicle as their main armored vehicle.
[07:38.100 --> 07:43.300]  And so I went ahead and got picked up at the airport at that, flew out of here.
[07:43.300 --> 07:49.820]  The plane was delayed, flew out of here about 430, got there about 515, got to the rally
[07:49.820 --> 07:54.500]  by about six, and was back at the airport by nine, and our flight got canceled.
[07:54.500 --> 07:59.300]  So I got a car, rental car, and drove back to Austin, Texas, and got some delicious
[07:59.300 --> 08:02.700]  shut-eye by about 2.30 a.m.
[08:02.700 --> 08:09.180]  So I am just collating a lot of this here on air like the rest of you are.
[08:09.180 --> 08:19.020]  But believe me, this is a broadcast you're not going to want to miss because let's just
[08:19.020 --> 08:21.740]  break down what's happening first off.
[08:21.740 --> 08:28.100]  I said yesterday that the president is in great danger of being assassinated.
[08:28.100 --> 08:34.460]  Now on that same day, we saw CNN producers say he hopes Trump dies, he hopes Trump is
[08:34.460 --> 08:35.460]  killed.
[08:35.460 --> 08:43.020]  Project Veritas released that, Tom Arnold tweeted that don't get too cocky-trader tweeting
[08:43.020 --> 08:44.020]  at Trump.
[08:44.020 --> 08:47.300]  They showed up for JFK2 in Dallas.
[08:47.300 --> 08:49.020]  So a clear threat there.
[08:49.020 --> 08:55.620]  You have Phil Mudd, who ran assassination operations with the CIA saying the government's
[08:55.620 --> 09:00.140]  going to kill Trump, and quote Stab Giuliani in the back with a shiv.
[09:00.140 --> 09:05.260]  Again, that's a prison knife, and we can play the compilations of them saying they're
[09:05.260 --> 09:08.660]  going to kill Trump and we want an assassination.
[09:08.660 --> 09:22.340]  And so I said, with Biden coming out on the debate stage three nights ago and saying,
[09:22.340 --> 09:27.940]  we need to not fight with each other, we need to focus on removing Trump by the 17th, well,
[09:27.940 --> 09:28.940]  that was last night.
[09:28.940 --> 09:37.300]  And I said, whoa, Dallas, 56 years later, all the other bizarre statements by Pelosi
[09:37.300 --> 09:42.700]  about bullets, orange bullets around her wrist and Cory Booker, I said, hey, everybody's
[09:42.700 --> 09:45.620]  got a real feeling of concern about this.
[09:45.620 --> 09:49.860]  I'm going up to Dallas with the crew.
[09:49.860 --> 09:56.500]  And did we stop Trump being assassinated, did we stop an attempted assassination?
[09:56.500 --> 09:58.260]  The world will never know.
[09:58.260 --> 10:02.820]  And I know this, drawing attention to the fact that the New York Times, the Washington
[10:02.820 --> 10:08.300]  Post, CNN, MSNBC, the LA Times, Vanity Fair, Esquire, I mean, you name it, they've all
[10:08.300 --> 10:11.700]  done it.
[10:11.700 --> 10:15.860]  I can remember five times that the New York Times said somebody needs to assassinate Trump,
[10:15.860 --> 10:23.540]  or I'm going to kill Trump, a reporter saying that, and Kathy Griffin holding up the bloody
[10:23.540 --> 10:24.540]  head.
[10:24.540 --> 10:28.700]  I don't know about that, and the politicians saying, go out and get them, attack them in
[10:28.700 --> 10:33.740]  Rand Paul, getting his ribs broken, Senator Paul and Congressman Scalise getting shot
[10:33.740 --> 10:37.180]  and the guy admitted he was trying to go there.
[10:37.180 --> 10:42.020]  And what in statements he made, left his friends and family that did nothing stopping, he drove
[10:42.020 --> 10:46.860]  there from Illinois to try to, quote, kill all 18 members of the conservative caucus
[10:46.860 --> 10:50.140]  baseball team.
[10:50.140 --> 10:52.260]  So that's the type of stuff going on.
[10:52.260 --> 10:58.060]  And then ABC News was there, it went national, was also local, and he goes, Alex Jones, I'm
[10:58.060 --> 11:02.620]  up in the armored vehicle, the police had stopped us to see what we were up to, they
[11:02.620 --> 11:03.620]  let us go.
[11:03.620 --> 11:04.620]  This is First Amendment.
[11:04.620 --> 11:08.140]  We're driving back and forth in front of it for, I mean, a good hour, right in front
[11:08.140 --> 11:15.300]  of the American Airlines Center, it's a beautiful old building.
[11:15.300 --> 11:22.500]  And he just looked at me with such mainstream media hate.
[11:22.500 --> 11:30.260]  And he said, Alex Jones, he said, you're a liar, nobody in the government, or nobody
[11:30.260 --> 11:33.300]  around the government saying, kill.
[11:33.300 --> 11:39.460]  Trump, well, we've got hours of footage from five different cameras that the crew is going
[11:39.460 --> 11:40.460]  through.
[11:40.460 --> 11:41.460]  Most of them only had a few hours sleep.
[11:41.460 --> 11:44.220]  We're close to having it probably by this hour, next hour.
[11:44.220 --> 11:50.420]  We have HD footage of me from on top of the armored vehicle and from our camera crew below
[11:50.420 --> 11:55.500]  with that ABC reporter saying, I'm a liar, nobody in government or connected to the government
[11:55.500 --> 11:59.620]  is calling for Trump's assassination.
[11:59.620 --> 12:04.380]  And I said, Phil Mudd said it.
[12:04.380 --> 12:09.900]  And I said, Brendan and Clapper said they're going to remove him outside of impeachment.
[12:09.900 --> 12:14.100]  And then raise their eyebrows and we'll blitzer and we've seen all the calls from to die.
[12:14.100 --> 12:15.820]  And he said, no, you're a liar.
[12:15.820 --> 12:17.980]  And I said, no, ABC News lies.
[12:17.980 --> 12:25.780]  I would never crop footage from Knob Creek machine gun shootout Expo, which is on my
[12:25.780 --> 12:27.700]  bucket list.
[12:27.700 --> 12:33.660]  And in Kentucky, I would never crop that and say it was Trump blowing up or allowing the
[12:33.660 --> 12:36.220]  Kurds to be blown up.
[12:36.220 --> 12:37.860]  So we're going to get to all of that.
[12:37.860 --> 12:42.700]  First big thing I'm going to hit is Trump coming out and saying we've got a peace deal.
[12:42.700 --> 12:45.700]  In the media, the left and the right acting like he's a devil.
[12:45.700 --> 12:52.620]  And what I saw on the ground was people waving Kurdish flags, flipping me off saying F Trump,
[12:52.620 --> 13:00.060]  saying, you know, down with Trump with Antifa spitting on us, hitting us.
[13:00.060 --> 13:04.820]  And I didn't even try to go into the Antifa group, but I did try to go down the street
[13:04.820 --> 13:11.300]  on the other side to videotape the pro Trump and then anti Trump people, the pro Trump
[13:11.300 --> 13:13.380]  people outnumbered the anti for Trump.
[13:13.380 --> 13:14.380]  I'd say 50 to one.
[13:14.380 --> 13:21.380]  I mean, when we left at eight o'clock at night, once Trump was inside speaking and
[13:21.380 --> 13:24.340]  been speaking a while, there were still giant lines around the block.
[13:24.340 --> 13:25.340]  People just gave up.
[13:25.340 --> 13:26.340]  They couldn't get in.
[13:26.340 --> 13:27.340]  It was overflow.
[13:27.340 --> 13:32.820]  Obviously, they had to check them for security issues, because security issues saw people
[13:32.820 --> 13:34.580]  just just never had time to get in.
[13:34.580 --> 13:35.980]  It was too bad.
[13:35.980 --> 13:45.100]  But the police directed us the way we were supposed to go, right by Antifa.
[13:45.100 --> 13:51.140]  And then let 200 Antifa out of, I'd say, about a 500 group surround us.
[13:51.140 --> 13:55.620]  And we've got unbelievable footage, but the cuss words are every second and the whistles
[13:55.620 --> 13:56.620]  and all the rest of it.
[13:56.620 --> 13:58.100]  We're going to have that footage for you today, though.
[13:58.100 --> 14:02.300]  Raw posted info wars.com beeped here on air, but it's almost pointless.
[14:02.300 --> 14:10.100]  Like one big beep and the what they stunk like a septic tank.
[14:10.100 --> 14:12.780]  I mean, these people are just the scum of the earth.
[14:12.780 --> 14:15.620]  So they followed us around the whole time.
[14:15.620 --> 14:17.860]  And then they got us all surrounded in the police.
[14:17.860 --> 14:20.220]  We went over to the police and said, please help us.
[14:20.220 --> 14:24.900]  And the police said no and walked away, a line of police very despicable.
[14:24.900 --> 14:29.220]  And you know, the guys I was with were either, you know, former police or folks that have
[14:29.220 --> 14:30.220]  worked with the police.
[14:30.220 --> 14:32.060]  And they said they'd never seen anything like it.
[14:32.060 --> 14:34.300]  It was very despicable.
[14:34.300 --> 14:37.980]  But it shows where America's gone with the political correctness that we were directed
[14:37.980 --> 14:38.980]  by the police.
[14:38.980 --> 14:41.820]  Oh, no, you can't go around this way, even though it was open.
[14:41.820 --> 14:42.820]  Go this way.
[14:42.820 --> 14:43.820]  Right.
[14:43.820 --> 14:45.220]  Really go into the Antifa.
[14:45.220 --> 14:47.340]  Yeah, that's the way you got to go.
[14:47.340 --> 14:49.860]  And there's police in there.
[14:49.860 --> 14:50.860]  And they did that.
[14:50.860 --> 14:55.620]  So that's that's all coming up as articles on info wars.com and news wars.com dealing
[14:55.620 --> 14:56.620]  with all that.
[14:56.620 --> 15:01.860]  And it just ties into watching people who can't even speak English going if Trump if
[15:01.860 --> 15:07.100]  America and I would from from the Middle East and I would say America's back.
[15:07.100 --> 15:11.820]  And boy, it was like throwing holy water on Linda Blair and the exorcist.
[15:11.820 --> 15:17.540]  When I would say America's back or the Democratic Party, you know, founded the KKK, they would
[15:17.540 --> 15:24.860]  just go, yeah, I mean, just some of them would just start shaking and fall down on the ground
[15:24.860 --> 15:26.460]  and start flopping around.
[15:26.460 --> 15:27.460]  You think I'm kidding.
[15:27.460 --> 15:28.460]  I've got footage of this.
[15:28.460 --> 15:29.460]  It was like exorcism.
[15:29.460 --> 15:33.900]  They say America's back, America's back and they go, well, you've seen the footage of
[15:33.900 --> 15:34.900]  people doing that.
[15:34.900 --> 15:35.900]  They go.
[15:35.900 --> 15:40.740]  So and then they start bumping into things and falling down.
[15:40.740 --> 15:43.900]  I mean, these people are something something's wrong with them.
[15:43.900 --> 15:45.180]  So you think I'm joking.

[16:06.940 --> 16:07.940]  is coming up.
[16:07.940 --> 16:09.500]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[16:09.500 --> 16:13.420]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:13.420 --> 16:14.980]  I sued the IRS in one.
[16:14.980 --> 16:17.940]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:17.940 --> 16:21.220]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[16:21.220 --> 16:23.460]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[17:15.900 --> 17:21.340]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[17:21.340 --> 17:22.460]  my life.
[17:22.460 --> 17:27.720]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.

[18:05.500 --> 18:16.620]  Look, I'm not trying to discourage other best-selling bone broth formulas that sell for 35, 40, 50,
[18:16.620 --> 18:20.420]  60 bucks retail that are discounted for like $39.95.
[18:20.420 --> 18:24.800]  But they don't have as much pure concentrated bone broth as we do.
[18:24.800 --> 18:26.300]  They don't have as much chocolate mushroom.
[18:26.300 --> 18:28.700]  They don't have as much bee pollen.
[18:28.700 --> 18:31.900]  They don't have as much of these amazing ingredients.
[18:31.900 --> 18:37.660]  And yes, we've gone out and just made a stronger version of other best-sellers and it's selling
[18:37.660 --> 18:38.660]  out.

[19:09.420 --> 19:14.420]  The globalists have been planning to make their move on America for decades and decades.
[19:14.420 --> 19:18.980]  Hillary was supposed to get in and complete the takeover, the censorship, all of it.
[19:18.980 --> 19:23.420]  That's why they took me off the air first and banned me across the internet because
[19:23.420 --> 19:28.020]  they knew that what we were saying was dead on and they didn't want us raising the alarm.
[19:28.020 --> 19:29.020]  Well, guess what?

[20:12.340 --> 20:28.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:28.140 --> 20:33.980]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:33.980 --> 20:43.580]  Well, it's a big red headline at dredgerport.com and I'm going to cover the next segment because
[20:43.580 --> 20:44.580]  that's a longer segment.
[20:44.580 --> 20:47.300]  This is very important.
[20:47.300 --> 20:53.740]  Trump campaign to sue CNN over pro impeachment bias demands substantial payment.
[20:53.740 --> 20:57.380]  Now, can Trump really do that?
[20:57.380 --> 21:03.180]  Well, the Democrats are suing me, even Associated Press had another article yesterday saying
[21:03.180 --> 21:08.020]  Jones insinuated Sandy Hook didn't happen because now they know they can get sued because
[21:08.020 --> 21:10.700]  I've been suing some media outlets that went, well, he insinuated.
[21:10.700 --> 21:16.420]  Well, you have a right to say it didn't happen, but to insinuate.
[21:16.420 --> 21:21.100]  So by their yardstick, Trump can totally sue him totally when because he has Jeff Zucker
[21:21.100 --> 21:24.860]  admitting that it's a bias and that he wants Trump taken out.
[21:24.860 --> 21:27.740]  I believe in free speech.
[21:27.740 --> 21:33.500]  And so what the Democrats have done is created a world where we're getting rid of everybody's
[21:33.500 --> 21:35.940]  speech and it's like a circular firing squad.
[21:35.940 --> 21:42.820]  In fact, I've got an article here where Martin Luther King's daughter, I may not have sent
[21:42.820 --> 21:43.820]  that to you.
[21:43.820 --> 21:50.820]  It's from daily caller guys pulling up for me is criticizing Mark Zuckerberg basically
[21:50.820 --> 21:57.540]  other it is saying he's not doing enough to censor.
[21:57.540 --> 22:00.300]  And then daily caller carries it because it's this circular logic.
[22:00.300 --> 22:02.700]  It's very dangerous.
[22:02.700 --> 22:03.700]  Very dangerous.
[22:03.700 --> 22:06.420]  She's like, oh, my dad got killed from conspiracy theories.
[22:06.420 --> 22:10.260]  Well, the answer would be an open debate to counter that.
[22:10.260 --> 22:17.460]  Now, your dad got killed because the FBI lobals and what FBI wound up some folks and assassinated
[22:17.460 --> 22:22.740]  him and then had James Earl Ray get set up to take the fall.
[22:22.740 --> 22:27.460]  So now that's all come out so but but I I have a tendency to say I'm going to cover
[22:27.460 --> 22:28.620]  something and start covering it.
[22:28.620 --> 22:37.060]  It's really important and I want to cover it next segment so I have more time.
[22:37.060 --> 22:41.060]  And like I said, guys, please print me that article from Martin Luther King's daughter
[22:41.060 --> 22:44.020]  because this is really important.
[22:44.020 --> 22:49.340]  Others are starting to take the bait on, oh, well, if someone's speech of a fact-checking
[22:49.340 --> 22:54.140]  group says it isn't true, well, then yeah, we need to have them taken off the Internet.
[22:54.140 --> 22:57.220]  Well, you can go create anything you want.
[22:57.220 --> 23:01.500]  Microsoft is funding News Guard.
[23:01.500 --> 23:04.580]  And then it's run by neocons.
[23:04.580 --> 23:08.820]  I mean, these are the biggest liars on the planet.
[23:08.820 --> 23:09.820]  Oh, there it is.
[23:09.820 --> 23:10.820]  It's actually in my stack.
[23:10.820 --> 23:11.820]  I missed that.
[23:11.820 --> 23:17.020]  So that's all coming up and I want to spend some time on what's really happening in Syria
[23:17.020 --> 23:20.220]  because I've had time to really study it.
[23:20.220 --> 23:22.580]  And I have to say, I agree with what the president's done.
[23:22.580 --> 23:28.620]  I think it's very, very well thought out, very, very pragmatic.
[23:28.620 --> 23:32.740]  And most importantly, he's doing what he said he would do.
[23:32.740 --> 23:37.380]  So I'm going to hit that in the last segment of the show or in great detail, we have a
[23:37.380 --> 23:43.740]  bunch of clips of it and boy, I saw the left just howling, the courage, the courage, the
[23:43.740 --> 23:46.580]  genocide, the mass murder.
[23:46.580 --> 23:55.380]  Where was the media when even the UN admits the persecution of Christians accounts for
[23:55.380 --> 23:58.700]  about 80% of all religious persecution in the world?
[23:58.700 --> 24:01.740]  It used to be about a third.
[24:01.740 --> 24:04.260]  A decade ago, persecution of Christians had doubled.
[24:04.260 --> 24:06.740]  Now it's really more than that.
[24:06.740 --> 24:07.740]  I think it's quadrupled.
[24:07.740 --> 24:13.220]  You can pull the numbers up, but persecution of Christians is skyrocketing.
[24:13.220 --> 24:18.140]  And you can pull up UN reports, this UN report on persecution of religious groups and Christians
[24:18.140 --> 24:22.100]  top the chart and it's getting worse and we all know about it.
[24:22.100 --> 24:26.500]  And Obama and others funded it and they murdered hundreds of thousands of people in the Arab
[24:26.500 --> 24:30.860]  Spring conservatively, most of them Christians displaced millions and millions and millions.
[24:30.860 --> 24:35.300]  Women put it as sex slavery and you'd have to find it buried in journals or buried in
[24:35.300 --> 24:36.900]  military reports.
[24:36.900 --> 24:42.580]  Little girls sold into sex slavery, gays thrown off buildings, all of this and the media tried
[24:42.580 --> 24:50.740]  to cover it all up because the West was funding the Arab Spring, which was a jihadi takeover.
[24:50.740 --> 24:52.660]  And so again, I'll get into all of that.
[24:52.660 --> 24:58.140]  But Trump is getting this peace deal, trying to iron this out.
[24:58.140 --> 25:05.860]  And originally, what the globalist wanted to do was break the country in three to four
[25:05.860 --> 25:06.860]  parts.
[25:06.860 --> 25:15.380]  Well, right now they're really just giving 90% of it to Syria and then dividing the other
[25:15.380 --> 25:19.460]  10% roughly between Turkey and the Kurds.
[25:19.460 --> 25:22.860]  And that's the part where the Kurds can go back and forth into Iraq, they never follow
[25:22.860 --> 25:23.860]  any borders or laws.
[25:23.860 --> 25:30.660]  That's what they get used by Western intelligence agencies to go between as a cutout, as a foil.
[25:30.660 --> 25:32.660]  And Trump is just saying, we're done with this.
[25:32.660 --> 25:33.900]  We don't want to destabilize anymore.
[25:33.900 --> 25:34.900]  We're out.
[25:34.900 --> 25:38.460]  But as I said, I'll hit that with the tail and play the clips last segment of this hour.
[25:38.460 --> 25:43.900]  And then I intend to open the phones up throughout the balance of this Friday global transmission.
[25:43.900 --> 25:50.420]  As I said, I would do earlier, there's a lot of others, huge news, mainstream media is
[25:50.420 --> 25:56.020]  promoting everywhere, corporate media is promoting everywhere, ABC News, NBC News, that everyone
[25:56.020 --> 25:58.220]  needs to get microchips to buy and sell.
[25:58.220 --> 26:00.780]  So that's being rolled out like it's the new credit card.
[26:00.780 --> 26:01.780]  We told you that was coming.
[26:01.780 --> 26:05.580]  We'll talk about just how dangerous that is, not just from a biblical perspective, but
[26:05.580 --> 26:07.820]  so many others.
[26:07.820 --> 26:12.940]  And we're going to look at William Barr and even some mainstream media saying that the
[26:12.940 --> 26:18.340]  word is Inspector General Port is going to be out today next week, that it's imminent,
[26:18.340 --> 26:23.380]  the latest on the Hong Kong mass massacres that are going on, and some big developments
[26:23.380 --> 26:26.660]  of on the NBA front.
[26:26.660 --> 26:27.660]  Very big developments there.
[26:27.660 --> 26:33.420]  I'll hit at the start of the next hour where I'd really been critical of the commissioner
[26:33.420 --> 26:36.260]  at first saying, Hey, let's not fight with China.
[26:36.260 --> 26:37.260]  Let's tamper this down.
[26:37.260 --> 26:39.420]  Let's not have a big controversy.
[26:39.420 --> 26:45.780]  And that was a wussification perspective, but we learned from day one behind the scenes.
[26:45.780 --> 26:51.460]  They told the chai comms, no, you're not going to order us who to hire and who to fire.
[26:51.460 --> 26:53.580]  That's not American values.
[26:53.580 --> 26:57.500]  Turns out day one behind the scenes, they were being somewhat more firm, but while trying
[26:57.500 --> 27:02.340]  to still kill the controversy, he's only releasing that info now because they've lost massive
[27:02.340 --> 27:03.860]  amounts of money.
[27:03.860 --> 27:09.380]  80% of their bread is buttered in the United States.
[27:09.380 --> 27:14.980]  So they were looking at that big old juicy communist hog they wanted to get on and gobble
[27:14.980 --> 27:20.140]  up, but your bread's still buttered here, and they are now getting religion.
[27:20.140 --> 27:25.340]  I like the NFL, Kaepernick, took down their viewership, about 40%, they've kind of tapped
[27:25.340 --> 27:26.940]  down on that anti-American stuff.
[27:26.940 --> 27:28.300]  They're just not force feeding it.
[27:28.300 --> 27:29.860]  You can still do it.
[27:29.860 --> 27:31.980]  And so suddenly the NFL's ratings are coming back.
[27:31.980 --> 27:32.980]  Really?
[27:32.980 --> 27:33.980]  Wow.
[27:33.980 --> 27:39.820]  We don't want the NFL to be a social justice warrior circle jerk every night.
[27:39.820 --> 27:41.020]  No, I don't think we do.
[27:41.020 --> 27:42.860]  So that's coming up.
[27:42.860 --> 27:44.860]  And just so much more.
[27:44.860 --> 27:51.220]  Please remember, viewers and listeners, that we go confront the globalist in D.C. face-to-face,
[27:51.220 --> 27:55.820]  the corrupt senators, the corrupt vice presidents, the corrupt politicians I've confronted, Hillary
[27:55.820 --> 28:00.860]  Clinton, Bill Clinton, Janet Reno, the head of Google, Sundar Pichai, the head of Twitter,
[28:00.860 --> 28:01.860]  all of them.
[28:01.860 --> 28:02.860]  We've never backed down.
[28:02.860 --> 28:05.380]  And last night we went and confronted Antifa.
[28:05.380 --> 28:06.380]  Was there.
[28:06.380 --> 28:07.380]  They surrounded us.
[28:07.380 --> 28:08.380]  We didn't back down.
[28:08.380 --> 28:09.380]  They attacked us.
[28:09.380 --> 28:10.500]  They hit me, pushed me.
[28:10.500 --> 28:12.300]  The police did nothing.
[28:12.300 --> 28:13.660]  My security had to push them off.
[28:13.660 --> 28:20.500]  We were there just to try to be as Christ-like as possible and not fight back, but let them
[28:20.500 --> 28:22.220]  show the world who they are.
[28:22.220 --> 28:28.340]  So that's all going to be coming up later because we keep showing footage of me walking
[28:28.340 --> 28:29.340]  in.
[28:29.340 --> 28:32.460]  We're going to show the footage once I got there and once they surrounded us.

[32:09.020 --> 32:13.340]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from MFullWars.
[32:13.340 --> 32:19.020]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[32:19.020 --> 32:24.420]  corporate tyranny, has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide.
[32:24.420 --> 32:29.580]  President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is
[32:29.580 --> 32:30.580]  amazing as well.
[32:30.580 --> 32:36.220]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas,
[32:36.220 --> 32:41.060]  but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China, Trump's
[32:41.060 --> 32:46.500]  been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're
[32:46.500 --> 32:51.660]  being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their
[32:51.660 --> 32:54.620]  war against humanity in a big way.
[32:54.620 --> 32:58.420]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them, but it's critical to not let
[32:58.420 --> 33:02.900]  ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[33:02.900 --> 33:04.780]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[33:04.780 --> 33:11.820]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[33:11.820 --> 33:25.180]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:25.180 --> 33:32.620]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[33:32.620 --> 33:45.340]  Coming up, episode two of the Trump reality show, except in this reality show, you can
[33:45.340 --> 33:51.260]  have a nuclear war, a financial collapse, a race war, a war between the sexes and the
[33:51.260 --> 33:56.140]  collapse of civilization because the globalists are really trying to carry that out.
[33:56.140 --> 33:59.300]  The truth is, it's not Trump's reality show.
[33:59.300 --> 34:06.220]  Trump is simply somebody with certain factions of the establishment backed by the American
[34:06.220 --> 34:13.460]  people thought might have a chance to help America not decide to commit suicide.
[34:13.460 --> 34:17.380]  And Trump's great achievement is drawing the globalist out and showing just how much they
[34:17.380 --> 34:23.860]  hate America and just how much they want to divide and conquer this nation.
[34:23.860 --> 34:28.820]  So President Trump has talked about mainstream corporate lying, media being the enemy of
[34:28.820 --> 34:29.820]  the people.
[34:29.820 --> 34:31.420]  He's talked about them being fake news.
[34:31.420 --> 34:34.220]  He's talked about them being corrupt.
[34:34.220 --> 34:35.220]  Corrupt media.
[34:35.220 --> 34:37.420]  And ladies and gentlemen, they are corrupt.
[34:37.420 --> 34:45.140]  Every day I see articles about myself that I know are completely not true and I'm not
[34:45.140 --> 34:51.820]  going to go over a laundry list of those, but you've seen examples of those.
[34:51.820 --> 35:00.500]  And so Trump's angle using the Layman Act from the 1940s is false advertising in that
[35:00.500 --> 35:06.620]  CNN says we're journalists, says that we're going to tell you the truth, telling you that
[35:06.620 --> 35:08.300]  they're balanced.
[35:08.300 --> 35:11.500]  And then you have their CEO saying, I don't want the truth.
[35:11.500 --> 35:12.900]  I want to remove Trump.
[35:12.900 --> 35:15.300]  I want division in America.
[35:15.300 --> 35:20.980]  I don't want anything positive said about him when it's the president.
[35:20.980 --> 35:26.900]  Now, Trump and his lawyers have a leg to stand on here, but not much in my view.
[35:26.900 --> 35:31.620]  I'm being sued by the Sandy Hook families backed up by the Democratic Party.
[35:31.620 --> 35:36.500]  They're claiming false advertising and they say that my fortune was made on Sandy Hook
[35:36.500 --> 35:38.860]  when I barely ever even talked about it.
[35:38.860 --> 35:42.820]  And so basically those lawyers and law firms have attached themselves to success of the
[35:42.820 --> 35:47.140]  show using stuff we barely talked about to continue to say they're being victimized by
[35:47.140 --> 35:52.460]  me, that it's a form of waving the bloody shirts, what it's called.
[35:52.460 --> 35:57.780]  But they're saying that there's an advertising formula to what we cover here.
[35:57.780 --> 36:02.740]  No, we cover what the big news is.
[36:02.740 --> 36:10.140]  And when Tom Arnold comes out and says somebody needs to kill Trump and Dallas, we cover that.
[36:10.140 --> 36:12.940]  Or when Trump sues CNN, we cover that.
[36:12.940 --> 36:19.100]  Or when the public doesn't believe official stories because they've been lied to so much,
[36:19.100 --> 36:20.100]  we cover that.
[36:20.100 --> 36:25.460]  And there's nothing more American than that.
[36:25.460 --> 36:32.740]  But at digress, but with CNN, it really is their marketing strategy to push the fake
[36:32.740 --> 36:36.580]  Russia gate and now the fake impeach gate and all the rest of it.
[36:36.580 --> 36:39.740]  But Trump is a public figure.
[36:39.740 --> 36:44.780]  Trump's argument is, though, that they are defrauding the general public as a consumer
[36:44.780 --> 36:49.380]  class of information who believe that they're supposedly getting accurate info and that
[36:49.380 --> 36:52.140]  CNN is consciously lying to them.
[36:52.140 --> 36:57.180]  It's like that famous movie that Andy Griffith stars in, The Face and the Crowd.
[36:57.180 --> 37:00.260]  I ought to watch that again.
[37:00.260 --> 37:04.740]  And he's a con man who ends up becoming this big national icon.
[37:04.740 --> 37:09.980]  This is like built on the idea of Roy Rogers.
[37:09.980 --> 37:16.980]  And at the end, he doesn't know that the camera audio is still on and he goes, I hate you,
[37:16.980 --> 37:17.980]  my viewers.
[37:17.980 --> 37:18.980]  I hate you, my listeners.
[37:18.980 --> 37:19.980]  You're such idiots.
[37:19.980 --> 37:22.940]  And he basically admits that he's been feeding on them.
[37:22.940 --> 37:29.020]  And that's something psychotics do, sociopaths sometimes, but psychotics love the brag.
[37:29.020 --> 37:31.900]  They send letters to the police taunting them.
[37:31.900 --> 37:34.620]  They send to the families taunting them.
[37:34.620 --> 37:36.700]  They want to get caught more and more.
[37:36.700 --> 37:38.860]  They do more and more outlandish things.
[37:38.860 --> 37:44.220]  And that's what the left's doing is kind of acting out because they are, if anything,
[37:44.220 --> 37:45.220]  psychotic.
[37:45.220 --> 37:50.740]  And so when you've got CNN, I mean, if you had me behind the scenes going, let's do
[37:50.740 --> 37:58.700]  bad things to people to make all this money, like Jeff Zucker's doing, then you could say,
[37:58.700 --> 38:01.900]  well, that's unfair trade practices, that's fraud.
[38:01.900 --> 38:03.300]  And that's what I've said about big tech.
[38:03.300 --> 38:06.180]  I've said, Trump could go out from many ways.
[38:06.180 --> 38:10.340]  The espionage, working with the chai comms, Google and Apple completely.
[38:10.340 --> 38:13.180]  I mean, my goodness, they've become state run over there and they admit it.
[38:13.180 --> 38:15.540]  That's unbelievable.
[38:15.540 --> 38:17.020]  And then these are US citizens.
[38:17.020 --> 38:18.020]  They can be indicted for espionage.
[38:18.020 --> 38:19.020]  It should be.
[38:19.020 --> 38:20.020]  It's cut and dry.
[38:20.020 --> 38:27.540]  But another way is, as I've said, fraudulent advertising, unfair trade practices.
[38:27.540 --> 38:32.860]  And I've sent letters to Trump by major law firms that developed those ideas two years
[38:32.860 --> 38:33.860]  ago.
[38:33.860 --> 38:36.220]  And that's one of the reasons they, of course, cracked down on us.
[38:36.220 --> 38:39.380]  There's actually a big article in Gateway Pundin about that today.
[38:39.380 --> 38:44.660]  He admitted with M4's first exposed Fiona Hill two years ago and how to stop it.
[38:44.660 --> 38:46.300]  And that's one reason we've been targeted for destruction.
[38:46.300 --> 38:50.580]  I appreciate Gateway Pundin getting that out because folks need to understand that we're
[38:50.580 --> 38:53.980]  in a total war here.
[38:53.980 --> 38:58.300]  I mean, they're really coming after us, Adam Schiff, star witness Fiona Hill was out of
[38:58.300 --> 39:03.700]  by Roger Stone and M4's as deep state Soros connected spy and 17.
[39:03.700 --> 39:04.700]  Yeah.
[39:04.700 --> 39:06.820]  And again, I'm not tuning a horn here.
[39:06.820 --> 39:12.700]  You understand that when you're a public figure and you back Trump, all hell breaks
[39:12.700 --> 39:13.700]  loose.
[39:13.700 --> 39:17.500]  So I'm saying, I'm not backing down and support the president.
[39:17.500 --> 39:23.900]  He has not been supporting us that have been persecuted and targeted and I'm still going
[39:23.900 --> 39:25.260]  to backing.
[39:25.260 --> 39:31.700]  But man, it's like holding somebody on your shoulders while Liliputian gremlins are eating
[39:31.700 --> 39:35.100]  your legs off.
[39:35.100 --> 39:40.260]  And I understand that Trump's up there trying to look confident, trying to get the country
[39:40.260 --> 39:41.260]  re-rebooted.
[39:41.260 --> 39:47.860]  So I trust him, but I understand why some people are going to start bulking.
[39:47.860 --> 39:59.180]  Because I liken it to if robbers were trying to kill your kid and there was a knife laying
[39:59.180 --> 40:04.220]  on top of stovetop that it was 300 degrees and, you know, you could grab the butcher
[40:04.220 --> 40:07.500]  knife and, you know, kill them, but you'd have to burn your hand really bad.
[40:07.500 --> 40:12.140]  And I've got a butcher knife in my hand politically stabbing the globalist, but it hurts really
[40:12.140 --> 40:13.140]  bad.
[40:13.140 --> 40:15.100]  I mean, my hands on fire here.
[40:15.100 --> 40:19.100]  And the American people and others that have been persecuted, a lot of people have been
[40:19.100 --> 40:20.820]  persecuted around Trump.
[40:20.820 --> 40:21.820]  They need action.
[40:21.820 --> 40:29.540]  We don't mind getting hurt, but we want to see the other guy politically bleeding badly
[40:29.540 --> 40:33.780]  and not Hillary walking around all arrogant and Obama walking around all arrogant and
[40:33.780 --> 40:38.340]  Comey and McCabe walking around and Mueller walking around all arrogant while they have
[40:38.340 --> 40:42.660]  been pissing gasoline on us and then lighting it.
[40:42.660 --> 40:44.740]  But I digress.
[40:44.740 --> 40:51.860]  I support the president's suit if it goes the wrong judges and I'm looking at the lawsuit
[40:51.860 --> 40:52.860]  right here.
[40:52.860 --> 40:57.820]  I mean, where they filed it and what district we're going to have Robert Barnes on today
[40:57.820 --> 41:02.180]  constitutional lawyer to analyze this and give us his take on it.
[41:02.180 --> 41:06.340]  But he looks like a pretty good suit, but it could still go nowhere.
[41:06.340 --> 41:12.140]  We don't have time though while this is battled out for even in a quick expedited way, six
[41:12.140 --> 41:14.700]  months with this election coming up.
[41:14.700 --> 41:17.180]  And again, it's not like CNN even has that much power.
[41:17.180 --> 41:20.060]  They don't even have that many viewers in a way.
[41:20.060 --> 41:24.980]  Trump always engaging them props up with a little bit of viewers they have because at
[41:24.980 --> 41:28.900]  a certain point when somebody's a known liar, why do we sit there and argue with them at
[41:28.900 --> 41:32.180]  the street corner?
[41:32.180 --> 41:33.180]  Stick a fork at them.
[41:33.180 --> 41:34.180]  They're done.
[41:34.180 --> 41:38.180]  I mean, they still force feed it in public schools to kids every morning and first period
[41:38.180 --> 41:45.740]  call CNN's 10 it's in train stations, it's in bus stations, it's in airports, it's in
[41:45.740 --> 41:51.900]  hotels, it's in bars, it's in restaurants, but everybody knows, oh, that's the CNN.
[41:51.900 --> 41:59.020]  I mean, really no one believes a word CNN says, maybe seven, eight percent in polls.
[41:59.020 --> 42:07.140]  But at least it's a publicity stunt bare minimum to be able to have in the suit things like
[42:07.140 --> 42:11.780]  President Donald J. Trump and Donald J. Trump for President Inc.
[42:11.780 --> 42:16.140]  This firm is litigation counsel for President Donald J. Trump and Donald J. Trump for President
[42:16.140 --> 42:17.140]  Inc.
[42:17.140 --> 42:23.700]  We write concerning your bias reporting practices relating to our clients.
[42:23.700 --> 42:27.020]  The terms you and your in this letter shall collectively refer to CNN.

[42:31.540 --> 42:37.500]  truth seekers, these are in quotes, united by the mission to inform, engage and empower
[42:37.500 --> 42:38.500]  the world.
[42:38.500 --> 42:41.100]  And your emphasis added, your slogan is the most trusted name and news.
[42:41.100 --> 42:44.900]  And then it just goes on to show then how they have the CEO and others admitting on
[42:44.900 --> 42:49.780]  video that we're going to misrepresent, we're going to oversimplify, we're going to lie,
[42:49.780 --> 42:54.500]  we're going to hide, black shooting, blacks, I mean, everything we know goes on is all
[42:54.500 --> 42:55.500]  right here.
[42:55.500 --> 42:56.500]  So I think it's a good idea.
[42:56.500 --> 42:58.620]  They're going to say, oh, the president follows lots of lawsuits.
[42:58.620 --> 42:59.620]  They don't go anywhere.
[42:59.620 --> 43:02.700]  You know, a lot of them go places, you never hear about it in the news because they never
[43:02.700 --> 43:03.700]  tell you.
[43:03.700 --> 43:06.260]  We'll get to the rest of the story when we come back and then into the situation with
[43:06.260 --> 43:07.260]  Syria.
[43:07.260 --> 43:08.260]  Please stay with us.
[43:08.260 --> 43:13.740]  Globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it.
[43:13.740 --> 43:18.300]  Didn't I say a thousand times that there's no way you're going to have an authoritarian
[43:18.300 --> 43:22.780]  corporate world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes, that has diplomatic community,
[43:22.780 --> 43:27.380]  that runs around saying it's communist and socialist power to the people, but then meanwhile
[43:27.380 --> 43:28.980]  is tax exempt again offshore.
[43:28.980 --> 43:32.580]  Well, Trump got that and all these other populace get it.
[43:32.580 --> 43:36.780]  Why would you throw away wealthy, successful countries and cultures just so you could say
[43:36.780 --> 43:41.700]  the communist Chinese, the David Rockefeller, put in power are better than everybody?
[43:41.700 --> 43:47.540]  That is a sick, freakish joke and I will not stand by and watch humanity turn over to these
[43:47.540 --> 43:52.740]  people and I beg God for the strength and the will to have the discernment to help
[43:52.740 --> 43:59.180]  be part of their defeat and I've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years and God is delivering
[43:59.180 --> 44:00.180]  because God is great.
[44:00.180 --> 44:08.180]  Thank God for his son, Jesus Christ and now let's move forward against the NWO.
[44:08.180 --> 44:11.060]  Silicon Valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish.
[44:11.060 --> 44:12.980]  They think the West is dead.
[44:12.980 --> 44:15.940]  They think if they censor nationalist and patriots off internet, you'll just forget
[44:15.940 --> 44:18.500]  about us and then they'll be the only information out there.
[44:18.500 --> 44:21.100]  Well, so far that's not been working too well for them.
[44:21.100 --> 44:25.900]  Thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly, but the resistance to globalism is alive and
[44:25.900 --> 44:30.940]  well at banned.video and now we've added a lot of new functions and a lot of new hosts

[47:12.820 --> 47:24.260]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:24.260 --> 47:28.140]  You could accept the fact that the city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportion.
[47:28.140 --> 47:29.300]  What do you mean?
[47:29.300 --> 47:30.300]  Biblical.
[47:30.300 --> 47:32.660]  What do you mean this Old Testament, Mr. Mayor?
[47:32.660 --> 47:34.340]  Real wrath of God type stuff.
[47:34.340 --> 47:36.740]  Zag fire and brimstone coming down from the skies.
[47:36.740 --> 47:37.740]  Rivers and seas boiling.
[47:37.740 --> 47:42.020]  Forty years of darkness, earthquakes, volcanoes, the dead rising from the grave.
[47:42.020 --> 47:47.500]  Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria.
[47:47.500 --> 47:54.820]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[47:54.820 --> 47:57.180]  the mind of man.
[47:57.180 --> 48:04.140]  Thomas Jefferson, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[48:04.140 --> 48:18.820]  Alex Jones, where the middle of a war, a war between good and evil, a war between different
[48:18.820 --> 48:24.540]  political power blocks that seek control of the future and control of the technocracy
[48:24.540 --> 48:35.220]  and the AI systems that will empower it and breathe Frankensteinian life into it.
[48:35.220 --> 48:41.620]  The globalist, if you had to describe them, are mad scientists.
[48:41.620 --> 48:48.620]  When you see Hollywood movies or read classic books, you just see the mad scientist over
[48:48.620 --> 48:54.380]  and over again doing crazy things, trying to discover the fabric of the universe or
[48:54.380 --> 48:56.980]  become God.
[48:56.980 --> 49:01.700]  And globalists want full control of the whole planet so they can dictate to the nation states
[49:01.700 --> 49:05.980]  how they're going to live and how they're going to operate.
[49:05.980 --> 49:14.900]  And so we're seeing deep state rage and the system going into crisis mode because President
[49:14.900 --> 49:21.860]  Trump has tried to get us out of Afghanistan and cut the troops back to almost nothing.
[49:21.860 --> 49:26.740]  He's been trying to get us out of Syria, he's ordering it, and the Pentagon's always
[49:26.740 --> 49:28.900]  got an excuse of why they got to stay there.
[49:28.900 --> 49:32.540]  Well, as Senator Paul has said and others, and as we've been saying before, Paul never
[49:32.540 --> 49:33.540]  did.
[49:33.540 --> 49:38.100]  I mean, we've got our research, we've had the experts on.
[49:38.100 --> 49:42.540]  The United States, under the Republican and Democrats before Trump, wanted to remove the
[49:42.540 --> 49:48.420]  Assad regime and other analysts said, you do that, you've got all these different groups
[49:48.420 --> 49:54.500]  is going to send into a Shiite Sunni civil war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
[49:54.500 --> 49:59.780]  Their proxy armies, the Kurds always have wanted the north of Iraq and of Syria.
[49:59.780 --> 50:02.580]  They claim it's theirs, never has been.
[50:02.580 --> 50:10.540]  They've been in a hundred year war going back to the Ottoman Empire with Turkey.
[50:10.540 --> 50:12.540]  Kurds blow stuff up in Turkey every week.
[50:12.540 --> 50:16.980]  I'm not saying Turkey's good, I'm not saying the Kurds are good.
[50:16.980 --> 50:17.980]  Why are we there?
[50:17.980 --> 50:21.820]  Why did Obama go destabilize it knowing it would create this mess?
[50:21.820 --> 50:26.620]  Because corrupt elements of the military industrial complex want to siphon off hundreds
[50:26.620 --> 50:30.300]  of billions of dollars every decade out of there.
[50:30.300 --> 50:33.460]  Like they've done in Ukraine in the conflict, like they've done in Afghanistan, now over
[50:33.460 --> 50:34.460]  a trillion.
[50:34.460 --> 50:35.460]  What is it?
[50:35.460 --> 50:36.460]  Five trillion in Iraq?
[50:36.460 --> 50:43.580]  You know what five trillion in roads and bridges and fast rail would look like to jobs
[50:43.580 --> 50:44.580]  in this country?
[50:44.580 --> 50:49.740]  How about we don't be in as much debt and we spend three trillion on that?
[50:49.740 --> 50:54.300]  But you see, that investment was for China, not here.
[50:54.300 --> 50:56.740]  Our trains go 40 miles an hour.
[50:56.740 --> 51:02.140]  Our trains went 150 miles an hour when my dad was a little kid.
[51:02.140 --> 51:08.060]  It would take him two and a half hours to drive from their ranch to Houston, to downtown
[51:08.060 --> 51:09.060]  Houston.
[51:09.060 --> 51:18.260]  And you get on a train and in 50 minutes they were in downtown Houston and you get off the
[51:18.260 --> 51:22.220]  train and go see the museums or go to restaurants.
[51:22.220 --> 51:27.340]  The train went 150 miles an hour at cruising speed.
[51:27.340 --> 51:36.540]  My dad's only 70 years old now, but when he was 10 years old he could go to Houston in
[51:36.540 --> 51:40.860]  less than an hour.
[51:40.860 --> 51:50.340]  My train to Houston now, it takes four hours from there.
[51:50.340 --> 51:57.460]  We have had no infrastructure built of any type that's real and lasting since the 70s.
[51:57.460 --> 52:01.380]  We've just upkept things and built a few new roads for neighborhoods and overpasses and
[52:01.380 --> 52:05.540]  things that are real infrastructures rotting.
[52:05.540 --> 52:08.700]  And that's what this is really all about.
[52:08.700 --> 52:13.660]  And oh, they can control the borders in Syria, they can control them in Iraq, we can control
[52:13.660 --> 52:14.660]  them in Afghanistan.
[52:14.660 --> 52:20.540]  A trillion plus, the China gets 98% of we're earth minerals, something like 20% of them
[52:20.540 --> 52:21.540]  come out of Afghanistan.
[52:21.540 --> 52:23.860]  They've gotten hundreds of billions out of there.
[52:23.860 --> 52:24.860]  Look it up yourself.
[52:24.860 --> 52:28.020]  Last time I checked, I think it's something like 200 billion out of Afghanistan.
[52:28.020 --> 52:29.860]  Look it up.
[52:29.860 --> 52:34.420]  They provide zero money for security, zero.
[52:34.420 --> 52:41.380]  We provide all of it through NATO in the U.S. and the rest of it.
[52:41.380 --> 52:43.780]  Got NATOs there.
[52:43.780 --> 52:48.060]  We fund half the U.N., what is it, 40 plus percent, almost half.
[52:48.060 --> 52:49.620]  So we're paying for almost all of it.
[52:49.620 --> 52:51.100]  The Chai comms pay zero.
[52:51.100 --> 52:52.500]  No wonder they can do all this stuff.
[52:52.500 --> 52:57.500]  No wonder they got trains that passengers ride that go 280 miles an hour.
[52:57.500 --> 53:01.460]  They got trains coming up that'll go 350.
[53:01.460 --> 53:10.500]  Can you imagine getting somewhere 350 miles away in an hour?
[53:10.500 --> 53:13.660]  That's almost as fast as a jet airplane.
[53:13.660 --> 53:17.620]  We can't have that because we haven't ever repaired any of our railways because it was
[53:17.620 --> 53:21.940]  decided we're not going to have that anymore.
[53:21.940 --> 53:23.260]  And I said I'd get to Trump.
[53:23.260 --> 53:24.260]  He just gave a speech.
[53:24.260 --> 53:28.940]  He's still giving statements in the White House on why he did this and is it going to
[53:28.940 --> 53:29.940]  be perfect?
[53:29.940 --> 53:30.940]  No.
[53:30.940 --> 53:32.380]  Turkey was already doing incursions.
[53:32.380 --> 53:36.460]  They've been doing incursions since this war started eight, nine years ago.
[53:36.460 --> 53:42.900]  They already had taken areas of southern Syria and western Syria.
[53:42.900 --> 53:45.340]  They got that huge border along them.
[53:45.340 --> 53:47.860]  And under Trump, they left.
[53:47.860 --> 53:51.660]  But that's because the deal was made that if Turkey did that, they were going to get
[53:51.660 --> 53:52.860]  this autonomous zone.
[53:52.860 --> 53:57.860]  And now Turkey's saying, hey, we're getting that 20-mile exclusion zone to keep the Kurds
[53:57.860 --> 53:58.860]  out.
[53:58.860 --> 54:02.380]  We're going to give you three-plus million people that are refugees into Europe.
[54:02.380 --> 54:04.500]  So and Trump goes, oh, that makes sense.
[54:04.500 --> 54:08.300]  The EU said, no, just go ahead and flood us with people.
[54:08.300 --> 54:10.340]  We're not going to let you send them back.
[54:10.340 --> 54:14.260]  Trump said, you know what, Erdogan, I get your point.
[54:14.260 --> 54:18.700]  You may not be a good guy, but we understand your territorial sovereignty.
[54:18.700 --> 54:19.700]  Send them back.
[54:19.700 --> 54:21.540]  Most of them are jihadi fighters.
[54:21.540 --> 54:22.540]  Most of them are men.
[54:22.540 --> 54:29.420]  You got these 30-year-old guys in middle school and high school in Europe, and they
[54:29.420 --> 54:33.300]  literally tell the 14-year-old girls in German after-school programs, hey, go ahead and get
[54:33.300 --> 54:37.260]  yourself an adult Muslim husband.
[54:37.260 --> 54:42.380]  They have little 14-year-old girls on TV going, here is my husband, he is 24, he goes to my
[54:42.380 --> 54:43.380]  school with me.
[54:43.380 --> 54:45.420]  And the guy's like, yeah, she's my bitch.
[54:45.420 --> 54:50.420]  I mean, you know, this is just sick cucking by the left.
[54:50.420 --> 54:56.300]  Sick, and I was there in Dallas last night with the Kurds screaming at me, F.U.
[54:56.300 --> 55:01.180]  Jones, F. Trump spitting at me, waving their flags, it's just give me a guarantee they're
[55:01.180 --> 55:02.340]  on welfare.
[55:02.340 --> 55:04.460]  I'm paying for these guys to spit in my face.
[55:04.460 --> 55:06.780]  I mean, give me a break.
[55:06.780 --> 55:09.820]  And so you've got this war zone ongoing.
[55:09.820 --> 55:13.980]  The globalists want to keep going, so we have to stay there, and Trump's like, hey, it's
[55:13.980 --> 55:14.980]  your problem.
[55:14.980 --> 55:20.060]  Hey, Mexico's got 227,000 dead now in the last eight years.
[55:20.060 --> 55:24.660]  His whole city's on fire, burning machine gun fights every day in major cities, hundreds
[55:24.660 --> 55:26.300]  dead every day.
[55:26.300 --> 55:27.780]  Are we going down there?
[55:27.780 --> 55:32.420]  Because we can't stop that either.
[55:32.420 --> 55:34.380]  Areas in Mexico are worse than Syria.
[55:34.380 --> 55:38.260]  Is that our, areas in South Chicago are worse than Syria.
[55:38.260 --> 55:45.220]  But CNN has orders out not to report on South-South Chicago, because that makes them Democrat
[55:45.220 --> 55:46.220]  politicians look bad.
[55:46.220 --> 55:51.060]  So here is the president just minutes ago telling you why he did it and what he's saying
[55:51.060 --> 55:55.620]  is pragmatic, it's true, and it follows his promise.
[55:55.620 --> 55:59.620]  But that's got, the left was just chanting at me, it's no longer Sandy Hook or you're
[55:59.620 --> 56:00.620]  a Russian agent.
[56:00.620 --> 56:05.340]  It was, you are a mass murderer, Alex Jones, you are hurting the Kurds.
[56:05.340 --> 56:06.340]  I've got the video coming up.
[56:06.340 --> 56:07.340]  We're having to bleep it.
[56:07.340 --> 56:10.460]  They are mean to the Kurds.
[56:10.460 --> 56:15.180]  These idiots didn't knew what the Kurds were last week, but they're all literally bust
[56:15.180 --> 56:20.340]  in homeless people, meth heads to go out and you'll get extra money if they beat somebody
[56:20.340 --> 56:21.340]  up.
[56:21.340 --> 56:26.500]  Let's, let's go to the president.
[56:26.500 --> 56:28.580]  There was some sniper fire this morning.
[56:28.580 --> 56:33.940]  There was mortar fire this morning that was eliminated quickly and they're back to the
[56:33.940 --> 56:35.900]  full pause.
[56:35.900 --> 56:40.420]  We have ISIS totally underguired.
[56:40.420 --> 56:42.420]  Turkey is also guarding separately.
[56:42.420 --> 56:43.420]  They're watching over everything.
[56:43.420 --> 56:45.420]  Stop here.
[56:45.420 --> 56:46.420]  I went to this too late.
[56:46.420 --> 56:50.100]  I'm going to come back and play a lot of this is important, but notice the media was cheerleading
[56:50.100 --> 56:51.100]  the corporate media.
[56:51.100 --> 56:52.100]  Oh, yay.
[56:52.100 --> 56:53.860]  There's still some fighting.
[56:53.860 --> 56:57.260]  The Kurds are still shooting at the Turks.
[56:57.260 --> 56:58.940]  The deal's going to fall through.
[56:58.940 --> 56:59.940]  Trump won't be a peacemaker.
[56:59.940 --> 57:01.940]  Yay wars continuing.
[57:01.940 --> 57:02.940]  Yay.
[57:02.940 --> 57:03.940]  Yay.
[57:03.940 --> 57:06.420]  We got to remove him.
[57:06.420 --> 57:07.420]  Yeah.
[57:07.420 --> 57:08.940]  He helped mass murder the Kurds.
[57:08.940 --> 57:13.380]  No one cares about the hundreds of thousands Christians killed by Obama and Hillary sending
[57:13.380 --> 57:15.260]  them all in.
[57:15.260 --> 57:17.260]  Remember that?
[57:17.260 --> 57:19.820]  Nobody cares about that.
[57:19.820 --> 57:23.180]  Nobody cares about the mass murder that's taking place.
[57:23.180 --> 57:24.940]  We're going to go to break.

[58:59.020 --> 59:04.300]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers who enforce your support and
[59:04.300 --> 59:10.460]  your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny
[59:10.460 --> 59:15.820]  has really caught hold not just here in the U.S. worldwide and President Trump's fearlessness
[59:15.820 --> 59:21.840]  when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well is still lacking
[59:21.840 --> 59:27.060]  on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas but trying to end
[59:27.060 --> 59:31.420]  the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist China Trump's been doing
[59:31.420 --> 59:37.460]  an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted
[59:37.460 --> 59:43.700]  because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity
[59:43.700 --> 59:47.660]  in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical
[59:47.660 --> 59:53.020]  to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an
[59:53.020 --> 1:00:02.340]  attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy you're
[1:00:02.340 --> 1:00:18.860]  listening to the Alex Jones show the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex
[1:00:18.860 --> 1:00:23.820]  Jones show well gateway pundit gets it right where was the media ISIS committed genocide
[1:00:23.820 --> 1:00:29.700]  on Christians killing 170,000 conservatively while Obama partied and did nothing they also
[1:00:29.700 --> 1:00:36.220]  killed Shiites Yazidis and others sold women into sex slavery meanwhile maybe a few hundred
[1:00:36.220 --> 1:00:40.180]  Kurds are being killed they've been attacking Turkey the Kurds are in a civil war with each
[1:00:40.180 --> 1:00:44.900]  other fighting over who'll control northern Syria and northern Iraq they've been a hundred
[1:00:44.900 --> 1:00:52.900]  year war with the Turks and Obama and Hillary destabilized Syria on record to break at least
[1:00:52.900 --> 1:00:59.980]  three parts well now Trump's leaving it mainly as Syria they can deal with Syria Turkey and
[1:00:59.980 --> 1:01:04.180]  the Kurds to say you're not getting all Syria you're not getting a big piece Turkey gets
[1:01:04.180 --> 1:01:09.180]  a little bit he's clever security zone to stop the Kurds and the Kurds get a little
[1:01:09.180 --> 1:01:13.340]  area in the north that they can then go back into Iraq where they've got an area so they've
[1:01:13.340 --> 1:01:18.340]  now got their homeland so they've won it for a hundred years but does Trump get nominated
[1:01:18.340 --> 1:01:23.860]  for a peace prize no ladies and gentlemen he must be removed he's committed genocide total
[1:01:23.860 --> 1:01:28.860]  crap Obama and Hillary started this destabilization that's why they get peace prices that's why
[1:01:28.860 --> 1:01:36.500]  Obama gets them so let's go back to the president just minutes ago and Joe Biden and Joe Biden
[1:01:36.500 --> 1:01:44.020]  son saying that his tremendous problems tremendous problems with Joe Biden son and the Ukraine
[1:01:44.020 --> 1:01:49.500]  so he's got tremendous problems with Biden son and Ukraine and it's inappropriate at
[1:01:49.500 --> 1:01:54.420]  all of the horrible things I mean you could get it you could see it it's been a big deal
[1:01:54.420 --> 1:01:57.820]  and I heard Schiff is going no no we don't want to talk about that we don't want to talk
[1:01:57.820 --> 1:02:02.340]  about that but he talked about it and it's one of those things look this is a terrible
[1:02:02.340 --> 1:02:08.300]  witch hunt this is so bad for our country I just spoke to President Erdogan of Turkey
[1:02:08.300 --> 1:02:14.820]  we're doing very very well with Turkey there's a ceasefire or a pause or whatever you want
[1:02:14.820 --> 1:02:19.740]  to call it there was some sniper fire this morning there was mortar fire this morning
[1:02:19.740 --> 1:02:28.820]  that was eliminated quickly and they're back to the full pause we have ISIS totally under
[1:02:28.820 --> 1:02:35.380]  guard Turkey is also guarding separately they're watching over everything so you have the Kurds
[1:02:35.380 --> 1:02:39.860]  who we're dealing with and are very happy about the way things are going I must say
[1:02:39.860 --> 1:02:45.620]  the Kurds and you also have the Turks watching just secondarily watching so we have ISIS
[1:02:45.620 --> 1:02:50.540]  under control we've taken control of the oil in the Middle East the oil that we're talking
[1:02:50.540 --> 1:02:56.220]  about the oil that everybody was worried about we have the U.S. has control of that and there
[1:02:56.220 --> 1:03:00.500]  are no shots being fired and a lot of people are doing a lot of things this is a deal that
[1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:06.060]  should have been made 15 years ago 10 years ago over the last number of years under the
[1:03:06.060 --> 1:03:11.700]  Obama administration the real numbers over a million people were killed we have lost
[1:03:11.700 --> 1:03:19.180]  no not a drop of blood since we've started what I've started and it was so far it's working
[1:03:19.180 --> 1:03:25.060]  out look it's a complicated region many many people have gone down I have to watch great
[1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:29.460]  interest as I see people talking about what we should be doing and these are the same
[1:03:29.460 --> 1:03:32.780]  people that have been failing for the last 20 years didn't know what they were doing
[1:03:32.780 --> 1:03:37.940]  especially when they went in and did what they did they shouldn't have been there but
[1:03:37.940 --> 1:03:43.820]  we're doing a very very significant amount of great work we'll see if it works it's very
[1:03:43.820 --> 1:03:48.940]  fragile it's been fragile for years they've been fighting each other for centuries literally
[1:03:48.940 --> 1:03:54.220]  for centuries they've been fighting each other and years ago we injected ourselves right
[1:03:54.220 --> 1:03:58.820]  into the middle of it and we won't go into whether or not that was a good thing or a
[1:03:58.820 --> 1:04:03.700]  bad thing you know how I feel about it but we've had tremendous success I think over
[1:04:03.700 --> 1:04:09.620]  the last couple of days a little bit unconventional a little bit of hard love I told you that
[1:04:09.620 --> 1:04:16.780]  a little it was a lot of a lot of pain for a couple of days and sometimes you have to
[1:04:16.780 --> 1:04:20.300]  go through some pain before you can get a good solution but the Kurds are very happy
[1:04:20.300 --> 1:04:30.100]  about it President Erdogan and Turkey is satisfied with it and we are in a very strong position
[1:04:30.100 --> 1:04:37.060]  we are also in a position where we could put tremendous powerful sanctions on Turkey or
[1:04:37.060 --> 1:04:42.260]  whoever else we want to our country is a financially much stronger country than when
[1:04:42.260 --> 1:04:46.580]  I took it over China would have been right now the strongest economy in the world the
[1:04:46.580 --> 1:04:49.780]  number one economy in the world and right now China
[1:04:49.780 --> 1:04:54.660]  we take over with economic deals that are good we don't take over with troops there
[1:04:54.660 --> 1:05:00.220]  and then we get none of the oil all the leftist lies about Iraq we're we're fraud we got
[1:05:00.220 --> 1:05:07.700]  zero oil let me explain that we come back in 60 seconds that's critical
[1:05:07.700 --> 1:05:11.820]  China was already running the United States you're like well China could never take over
[1:05:11.820 --> 1:05:18.420]  the US that's right as the Roman historian and senator Cicero warned a powerful empire
[1:05:18.420 --> 1:05:25.380]  can't fall from without before it first falls from within so yes they're coming for your
[1:05:25.380 --> 1:05:30.300]  guns all of them yes they're coming for your children they've already taken your speech
[1:05:30.300 --> 1:05:36.220]  almost everywhere except pockets of resistance like info wars dot com and banned on video
[1:05:36.220 --> 1:05:42.100]  so now you know why I'm so upset now you know why I'm so angry I saw the producers of South
[1:05:42.100 --> 1:05:47.020]  Park on TV they're totally pissing angry people like why are they angry because they see all
[1:05:47.020 --> 1:05:52.700]  of their freedom their American freedom hard fought taken away are you going to get upset
[1:05:52.700 --> 1:05:57.020]  well you're a listener you're obviously are upset but you've got to ring the alarm everywhere
[1:05:57.020 --> 1:06:01.620]  until others they've got to get upset and then take action and let Congress everybody else
[1:06:01.620 --> 1:06:24.980]  know that we're not backing down and we're not going to sell America out of the Chicago's
[1:06:24.980 --> 1:06:32.380]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance from the info wars dot
[1:06:32.380 --> 1:06:46.180]  com studios it's Alex Jones well mad dog Mattis is loved by the corporate medium because
[1:06:46.180 --> 1:06:54.500]  he's an effeminate a feet joke and the globalist love jokes have like a little candy ass is the
[1:06:54.500 --> 1:06:59.380]  leader of the Marines it's it's all all part of their sick jokes he's not the leader of
[1:06:59.380 --> 1:07:05.220]  the Marines he's a globalist he fancies himself as an emperor Palpatine and he makes these
[1:07:05.220 --> 1:07:14.260]  ridiculous pseudo-intellectual statements the guy is a fraud and a fop he is a complete
[1:07:14.260 --> 1:07:28.780]  candy ass and he was at the big Al Green dinner the one that Trump famously blasted Hillary
[1:07:28.780 --> 1:07:36.180]  face to face that and really tore into Trump will just remember Mattis came up through
[1:07:36.180 --> 1:07:42.980]  a power structure and in power under Obama and under Bush senior and all the rest of
[1:07:42.980 --> 1:07:49.180]  it because he wasn't a self-made man Trump never ran for office and won the presidency
[1:07:49.180 --> 1:07:52.980]  Trump's defeating China in a trade war they love to say oh he got money from his daddy
[1:07:52.980 --> 1:08:00.260]  and all the rest of the stuff so Mattis cannot hold Trump's jocks crap and this is not about
[1:08:00.260 --> 1:08:13.620]  kissing Trump's corpulent Pachydermis this is about the reality that there are a lot
[1:08:13.620 --> 1:08:19.660]  of really cool Marines like General Dumford and other people have some credibility and
[1:08:19.660 --> 1:08:23.700]  have stood with the president Mattis was a little snake for the beginning but lied to
[1:08:23.700 --> 1:08:32.860]  Trump's face that he agreed with his policies while being a sniveling rat in the background
[1:08:32.860 --> 1:08:37.980]  and the same thing with McMaster from the army Baranian Fiona Hill totally a Soros
[1:08:37.980 --> 1:08:43.340]  operative would talk crap about Trump right behind his back tried to lead a coup against
[1:08:43.340 --> 1:08:50.220]  the president so these generals are yes men most of them and the old days they were not
[1:08:50.220 --> 1:08:56.740]  put into power because they were yes men America prided itself on not being yes men and if
[1:08:56.740 --> 1:09:00.340]  you go back to people like Admiral Nimitz you know is from Fredericksburg Texas or General
[1:09:00.340 --> 1:09:06.380]  Eisenhower from Texas I mean those guys came up through the ranks because they did the best
[1:09:06.380 --> 1:09:11.700]  job had the highest scores fought the highest would work 24 hours a day of Astu and were
[1:09:11.700 --> 1:09:16.020]  serious professionals and we just don't have the same type of generals today let's just
[1:09:16.020 --> 1:09:22.940]  be honest about it so Trump's worship of these generals is dangerous and is ill founded and
[1:09:22.940 --> 1:09:28.980]  some of them are great people but a lot of them are really bad actors I mean hell the
[1:09:28.980 --> 1:09:35.260]  head of the Air Force Academy I left this SJW caught manipulating you know fake hate
[1:09:35.260 --> 1:09:42.260]  crimes on the basis that's what they do okay they're change agents that lust after getting
[1:09:42.260 --> 1:09:47.460]  control of the clergy getting control of law enforcement getting control of the military
[1:09:47.460 --> 1:09:52.220]  getting control of academia getting control of banking getting control of the media getting
[1:09:52.220 --> 1:09:57.940]  control of the family and then now they're moving into engineering and mathematics and
[1:09:57.940 --> 1:10:05.500]  butchering all of that this is a takeover and these globalists get power while they're
[1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:10.780]  in the process of taking over towards the goal of total power because if they could
[1:10:10.780 --> 1:10:18.380]  just hijack our republic they could dominate the world but they're in the process of running
[1:10:18.380 --> 1:10:21.860]  the country into the ground and Trump's like wait a minute we'll have the biggest most
[1:10:21.860 --> 1:10:27.580]  powerful military we'll have jobs we'll release the hidden technologies the hidden medical
[1:10:27.580 --> 1:10:31.980]  breakthroughs and we'll go to war if somebody starts a fight with us or messes with our
[1:10:31.980 --> 1:10:36.540]  interest but we're not just going to feed our troops down a garbage disposal because
[1:10:36.540 --> 1:10:41.540]  a bunch of chicken neck CIA leftist I mean you know it works the few CIA or state people
[1:10:41.540 --> 1:10:47.760]  that are in a country are in armored compounds with 10 foot thick walls and they ship in
[1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:54.740]  prostitutes and alcohol and lobster and the military are in rotting facilities with lice
[1:10:54.740 --> 1:10:59.340]  all over the airplanes and toilets not even working and everything disintegrating and you
[1:10:59.340 --> 1:11:04.420]  know they they take it because they're tough Americans and then the CIA people will be
[1:11:04.420 --> 1:11:12.220]  right next door and despise them hate them tell them get my bags you're a dumb ass and
[1:11:12.220 --> 1:11:16.940]  you've seen Henry Kissinger statement calling the military dumb animals cannon fodder this
[1:11:16.940 --> 1:11:22.700]  is the elitist attitude these are not elitist you think alexander the great treat his trips
[1:11:22.700 --> 1:11:28.020]  like that think George Washington acts like that you think Napoleon Bonaparte acted like
[1:11:28.020 --> 1:11:33.900]  that I'm saying Napoleon's a good guy but he let his trips from the front we don't have
[1:11:33.900 --> 1:11:39.140]  people like that anymore well Trump leads from the front I'm leading from the front
[1:11:39.140 --> 1:11:42.980]  and I don't even want to be a leader I've got to be a leader I can't sit I keep waiting
[1:11:42.980 --> 1:11:49.060]  for somebody else to take action and you've taken action supporting us but I want to finish
[1:11:49.060 --> 1:11:52.340]  up a little bit more Trump's speech earlier where he's laying out hey this has been going
[1:11:52.340 --> 1:11:56.860]  on for decades hundred year war should have made deals 15-10 years ago Turkey's going
[1:11:56.860 --> 1:12:01.620]  to take a big part of the country which they've agreed to leave in the in the West if we don't
[1:12:01.620 --> 1:12:05.380]  remember when they were already in there in their 20-30 miles he said we don't give them
[1:12:05.380 --> 1:12:09.260]  this little autonomous zone it's over well now he has a deal some of the Kurds are in
[1:12:09.260 --> 1:12:13.860]  civil war with each other they're not signing on to the deal but most the Kurds did they're
[1:12:13.860 --> 1:12:18.540]  finally getting their autonomous zone in northern Syria and northern Iraq they're nomads they
[1:12:18.540 --> 1:12:25.620]  go back and forth there for thousands of years that should be praised as wow the peacemaker
[1:12:25.620 --> 1:12:32.900]  instead the guy who's fixing Obama's mess with the globalist mess to bring to Brzezinski's
[1:12:32.900 --> 1:12:39.820]  plan to keep our troops always in the Middle East and Asia Minor and Central Asia that's
[1:12:39.820 --> 1:12:46.700]  the grand chessboard control that control the world bull that theory is wrong that's where
[1:12:46.700 --> 1:12:52.820]  empires go to die you can cut it off economically if it doesn't play ball and tries to dominate
[1:12:52.820 --> 1:13:02.780]  China and the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean controls the world India and China and
[1:13:02.780 --> 1:13:13.860]  the Koreas and Vietnam and Japan and the Philippines and Australia and Hawaii and the West Coast
[1:13:13.860 --> 1:13:19.820]  and Central and South America's West Coast that's the future and Russia with all that
[1:13:19.820 --> 1:13:26.820]  land but is it three four times bigger than the U.S. geographically that's the future
[1:13:26.820 --> 1:13:30.340]  and Africa that wasn't always being destabilized that's the future let's not go back to work
[1:13:30.340 --> 1:13:36.460]  for Trump let's put a few minutes of a Mattis roasting Trump supposedly and all it is is
[1:13:36.460 --> 1:13:46.660]  a bunch of disgraceful crap here it is some of you were kind during the reception and
[1:13:46.660 --> 1:13:53.380]  asked me you know if this bothered me to have been rated this way based on what Donald Trump
[1:13:53.380 --> 1:13:58.140]  said I said of course not I earned my spurs on the battlefield Martin as you pointed out
[1:13:58.140 --> 1:14:03.820]  and Donald Trump earned his first in a letter from a doctor not in the least bit put out
[1:14:03.820 --> 1:14:09.220]  by it and I think the only person in the military that Mr. Trump doesn't think is overrated
[1:14:09.220 --> 1:14:14.940]  is when you pointed out Martin that's Colonel Sanders it was not the foreign aggressor we
[1:14:14.940 --> 1:14:23.500]  must fear it was corrosion from within the rot the viciousness the lassitude the ignorance
[1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:29.820]  anarchy is one potential consequence of all this another is the rise of an ambitious leader
[1:14:29.820 --> 1:14:37.580]  unfettered by conscience or precedent or decency who would make himself supreme if destruction
[1:14:37.580 --> 1:14:45.340]  be our lot Lincoln warned we must ourselves be its author and finisher I think often of
[1:14:45.340 --> 1:14:50.140]  Abraham Lincoln's lyceum speech because it embodies both our greatest hopes and our darkest
[1:14:50.140 --> 1:14:56.780]  fears today in our own time we need only look around us for decades our political conduct
[1:14:56.780 --> 1:15:04.420]  has been woeful and a source of national paralysis we have supplanted trust and empathy with suspicion
[1:15:04.420 --> 1:15:10.420]  and contempt we have scorched our opponents with language that precludes compromise we
[1:15:10.420 --> 1:15:16.260]  have brushed aside the possibility the person with whom we disagree might actually sometimes
[1:15:16.260 --> 1:15:24.260]  be right we proclaim what divides us and seldom even acknowledge what unites us meanwhile
[1:15:24.260 --> 1:15:29.900]  the roster of urgent national issues have continued to grow unaddressed and given the
[1:15:29.900 --> 1:15:35.980]  paralysis impossible to address and all of this was approaching a level of crisis even
[1:15:35.980 --> 1:15:43.620]  before the specter of impeachment arose this is the moment for an act of remembrance remembrance
[1:15:43.620 --> 1:15:48.980]  of the core principles we used to know and live by and that we now seem to have forgotten

[1:22:26.100 --> 1:22:34.180]  say the first 10 we're gonna open the phones up first for 10 callers who disagree with
[1:22:34.180 --> 1:22:39.420]  me and think that trump should be impeached but i'm really asking you to be serious i
[1:22:39.420 --> 1:22:44.900]  don't want it to be tongue in cheek i know people are listening who really think trump
[1:22:44.900 --> 1:22:48.620]  should be impeached he said they who think that we've abandoned the cards and think
[1:22:48.620 --> 1:22:57.580]  that you know trump is profiting and violating the emoluments clause by allowing any political
[1:22:57.580 --> 1:23:05.580]  things to ever happen at his hotels it's your chance to call in and tell us why trump should
[1:23:05.580 --> 1:23:11.460]  be removed but the democrats that have openly been against the country and for global government
[1:23:11.460 --> 1:23:17.220]  and who want all this war and who let hundreds of thousands of christians get killed i want
[1:23:17.220 --> 1:23:25.420]  you to explain to me how they're the bad guys the trump administration and i also noticed
[1:23:25.420 --> 1:23:30.660]  that in the twitter comments attacking yours truly and others from abc news when they showed
[1:23:30.660 --> 1:23:35.780]  me in the armored vehicle bullhorning at the trump event last night outside most the commenters
[1:23:35.780 --> 1:23:42.420]  said i want him arrested i want him killed i want him in prison i mean if i talk like
[1:23:42.420 --> 1:23:47.020]  that it'd be national news plus i don't want any of you killed but the left really hasn't
[1:23:47.020 --> 1:23:54.820]  organized itself in an echo chamber into a violent miscreant hateful clip and we could
[1:23:54.820 --> 1:24:00.780]  have an incredibly powerful show today if i just aired the milley weaver and katlyn
[1:24:00.780 --> 1:24:09.420]  menant reports they both filed four or five reports that i personally watched last night
[1:24:09.420 --> 1:24:13.100]  waiting for our airplane that got cancelled and then driving back that wasn't driving
[1:24:13.100 --> 1:24:19.820]  but i was in the car to austin and getting back at you know one a.m. it was just riveting
[1:24:19.820 --> 1:24:25.420]  footage that's up at info wars dot com and news wars dot com in the latest it's always
[1:24:25.420 --> 1:24:33.660]  posted in their own channels at band dot video just staggering how stupid the left is some
[1:24:33.660 --> 1:24:45.580]  of the footage they had major demonstrations calling for men to recognize tampon equality
[1:24:45.580 --> 1:24:49.100]  and if you can figure out what that means you're a rocket scientist but we're gonna play that
[1:24:49.100 --> 1:24:55.660]  report these are insane people and the operating system the left is really satanism on one
[1:24:55.660 --> 1:25:00.540]  end and the other end mental illness they're either outright devil worshipers that just
[1:25:00.540 --> 1:25:04.220]  are nihilistic and hate everything or i guess believe it nothing you could say that wouldn't
[1:25:04.220 --> 1:25:09.060]  be a satanist but that was just it's just scum of the earth or they're mentally ill
[1:25:09.060 --> 1:25:16.980]  and don't know what planet they're in so that's all coming up as well and i know we're gonna
[1:25:16.980 --> 1:25:23.780]  be getting milley weaver on some of the later shows coming up today so here's the toll free
[1:25:23.780 --> 1:25:28.540]  number to join us how insane is this going to get because we're in a war now this is
[1:25:28.540 --> 1:25:36.140]  the fog of war this is the insanity war it's an economic war it's a cultural war it is
[1:25:36.140 --> 1:25:44.140]  a economic war and we're really winning sanity is winning because we're competent we're focused
[1:25:44.140 --> 1:25:50.660]  but it's still scary to see the level of insanity and to know that we've put up with the insanity
[1:25:50.660 --> 1:25:55.420]  and the corruption and we're letting it breed and if we don't now go on the offensive culturally
[1:25:55.420 --> 1:26:01.740]  and turn the tide that long term they're going to win and civilization will collapse and
[1:26:01.740 --> 1:26:05.380]  the mentally ill occultists and others just won't even know what's happening when it happens
[1:26:05.380 --> 1:26:09.820]  they have no memory they just destroy whatever they touch and do you really want to sit there
[1:26:09.820 --> 1:26:19.140]  and watch this happen in a world all these children are growing up in 877-789 alex 877-789-2539
[1:26:19.140 --> 1:26:28.140]  877-789-2539 and we will take your phone calls here on this friday edition then of course
[1:26:28.140 --> 1:26:33.180]  lord willing nothing's guaranteed i'll be back this sunday four to six p.m. for the
[1:26:33.180 --> 1:26:41.900]  sunday show as well now before i go to bring him back with the huge china developments
[1:26:41.900 --> 1:26:48.580]  with the nba these are big developments and positive so maybe america may actually find
[1:26:48.580 --> 1:26:54.260]  its soul or maybe something else happened we'll we'll talk about that i promise we start
[1:26:54.260 --> 1:27:00.100]  the next segment i need listeners to understand something info wars really is important the
[1:27:00.100 --> 1:27:04.100]  globalists are obsessed with it because it's a place where you can call in it's a place
[1:27:04.100 --> 1:27:10.900]  where americana ideas and ideas that are really popular and really work are allowed to flourish
[1:27:10.900 --> 1:27:15.180]  and the globalists have to have radio silence to have people accept things that don't make
[1:27:15.180 --> 1:27:19.140]  sense and aren't in their own interest that's why they promote mental illness and insanity
[1:27:19.140 --> 1:27:24.020]  and degeneracy is because they need you to give up on what works by never knowing it
[1:27:24.020 --> 1:27:30.460]  actually exists and they themselves then have been trying to make us insane or the process
[1:27:30.460 --> 1:27:36.420]  of trying to make us insane minions that they control so we're not in the game so they can
[1:27:36.420 --> 1:27:42.460]  control the future they themselves have drunk deeply from their own wine their own poison
[1:27:42.460 --> 1:27:53.260]  they've smoked their own dope their own cyanide poison but we need to be able to be on air
[1:27:53.260 --> 1:27:57.060]  and man when i talk about how great the products are when i come on here and promote them we're
[1:27:57.060 --> 1:28:02.900]  able to find ourselves when i don't it's like flipping a light switch we don't and quite
[1:28:02.900 --> 1:28:07.460]  frankly i should be more into promoting the products because they really are a big part
[1:28:07.460 --> 1:28:12.980]  of the solution i had the crew print a bunch of articles from studies and even mainline
[1:28:12.980 --> 1:28:17.900]  news back when they were telling the truth about the iodine conspiracy and about iq reduction
[1:28:17.900 --> 1:28:22.660]  all over the world with lower iodine and just minor deficiencies causing all sorts of health
[1:28:22.660 --> 1:28:28.940]  problems isn't that a huge issue isn't that just gigantic and i never even got to it yesterday
[1:28:28.940 --> 1:28:33.180]  but before i end the broadcast today i i'm going to spend a segment on that after we
[1:28:33.180 --> 1:28:37.460]  take calls because i want to show you these studies and yes i sell iodine yes i want you
[1:28:37.460 --> 1:28:42.340]  to buy the iodine so i can stay on air to warn more people to buy iodine to stay on
[1:28:42.340 --> 1:28:45.460]  air to get more people to buy iodine because we have the best iodine but just to realize
[1:28:45.460 --> 1:28:50.300]  that this isn't a war and if you have high intelligence you are apt to not be conned
[1:28:50.300 --> 1:28:56.220]  as much the people perish for lack of knowledge so we have stopped the iodine conspiracy wake
[1:28:56.220 --> 1:29:03.420]  up the world challenge get bio tricillinium that boost the iodine with x2 and x3 all 60%
[1:29:03.420 --> 1:29:08.220]  off when you get them all three together my fellow freedom lovers i'm very excited to

[1:33:34.220 --> 1:34:03.180]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen i am your host alex jones and we are into the middle
[1:34:03.180 --> 1:34:08.860]  of the global transmission today you know i was just mentioning this but i was reading
[1:34:08.860 --> 1:34:11.620]  it during the break when i actually pulled out some of the news articles i was going
[1:34:11.620 --> 1:34:16.940]  to cover yesterday about iodine deficiency and i was looking back over it and it's just
[1:34:16.940 --> 1:34:29.020]  spectacular how incredibly important all of this is i mean look at these headlines china
[1:34:29.020 --> 1:34:35.340]  confronts retardation of millions deficient in iodine millions of retarded people and
[1:34:35.340 --> 1:34:40.500]  millions others brain damage and millions others with just low IQs and millions others
[1:34:40.500 --> 1:34:48.300]  who are autistic directly from iodine deficiency that's the new york times 1996 pregnant mothers
[1:34:48.300 --> 1:34:56.860]  and the dangers of iodine deficiency the london guardian 2015 china confronts again adding
[1:34:56.860 --> 1:35:05.220]  iodine to salt resulted in a decade's worth of IQ gains for the united states the effects
[1:35:05.220 --> 1:35:11.740]  of iodine on intelligence and children a meta analysis of studies conducted in china effects
[1:35:11.740 --> 1:35:17.140]  of drinking water with high iodine concentration on the intelligence of children in china the
[1:35:17.140 --> 1:35:26.380]  government put it in the water and found explosive IQ increases russians rushed to buy iodine
[1:35:26.380 --> 1:35:32.980]  and what's incredible is we have conservatively hundreds of thousands of people tuned in every
[1:35:32.980 --> 1:35:36.940]  millisecond we have millions that tune in throughout the day i mean at our peak we'd
[1:35:36.940 --> 1:35:42.660]  have like 15 million people a day no joke way bigger than limbaugh even under all the
[1:35:42.660 --> 1:35:48.180]  restrictions millions and millions a day and i know that it's less than one percent of
[1:35:48.180 --> 1:35:53.820]  people that ever buy anything and i i talked about these studies yesterday and i think
[1:35:53.820 --> 1:36:03.180]  we sold a hundred bottles extra of x2 and x3 i mean we could literally fund ourselves
[1:36:03.180 --> 1:36:10.420]  if two percent of the listeners actually listened to me and realized i'm not kidding about iodine
[1:36:10.420 --> 1:36:15.020]  how it's the good halogen how they put the bad halogen chlorine fluoride bromine they're
[1:36:15.020 --> 1:36:20.940]  all in the same family in the water how it then literally lowers IQ on top of not having
[1:36:20.940 --> 1:36:28.300]  the i the iodine lowering IQ this is one of the biggest things the globalists do to make
[1:36:28.300 --> 1:36:34.100]  sure we're dumb and we're dull and we're manageable but once you get somebody in a dull manageable
[1:36:34.100 --> 1:36:41.780]  state and then you entertain them to death with thousands of new netflix shows a month
[1:36:41.780 --> 1:36:50.460]  it's over they just are huh and they can't even self preserve it's a fact that 97 percent
[1:36:50.460 --> 1:36:56.580]  of water supply in the u.s. has glyphosate in it it's a fact it gives you breast cancer
[1:36:56.580 --> 1:37:05.700]  grows it like miracle grow grows plants in all the studies and i just breast cancer here
[1:37:05.700 --> 1:37:11.780]  breast cancer there and i'll be sitting there talking to family that's smart it's got breast
[1:37:11.780 --> 1:37:17.140]  cancer and i'll go i'll i'll be watching them get tap water right out of their tap in the
[1:37:17.140 --> 1:37:24.660]  major city how's your chemotherapy going oh it's really horrible you know you might want
[1:37:24.660 --> 1:37:29.820]  to drink filtered water oh i've seen studies articles that bottle waters as bad as tap
[1:37:29.820 --> 1:37:34.180]  and i'm looking i'm going well that's a false study because a lot of bottle water is really
[1:37:34.180 --> 1:37:38.620]  high high end especially if it's artesian comes from you know really good old wells
[1:37:38.620 --> 1:37:42.380]  that have been tested and i and but yeah some of the big name brands just take tap water
[1:37:42.380 --> 1:37:45.420]  and then put them through charcoal and the people are always like i don't want to hear
[1:37:45.420 --> 1:37:50.580]  it you know it's like oh they don't want to hear information they just want to drink their
[1:37:50.580 --> 1:37:59.380]  tap water that literally taste like some type of foul smelling whiskey i mean i grew up in
[1:37:59.380 --> 1:38:04.620]  dallas and nobody was telling me that the water was bad i remember being a kid and i'd be out
[1:38:04.620 --> 1:38:08.500]  running around all and i'd come in and drink a glass of water i remember it tasting bad
[1:38:08.500 --> 1:38:11.980]  i remember getting a headache after it i remember going to my dad and saying why does the water
[1:38:11.980 --> 1:38:19.220]  taste so bad he'd be like you're lucky why the water in houston sets on fire and then
[1:38:19.220 --> 1:38:24.060]  i've got a bunch of friends who had brothers or sisters that were deformed and then died
[1:38:24.060 --> 1:38:29.500]  because they were born in houston and the doctors tell them there oh it was the toxic
[1:38:29.500 --> 1:38:34.140]  chemicals in the water from the refineries you know in the old days they just dumped
[1:38:34.140 --> 1:38:48.940]  it out in the river they still do and and it's just mind blowing to me
[1:38:48.940 --> 1:38:55.180]  that i go on air and i say get an elixir pure breeze or propure they're both excellent
[1:38:55.180 --> 1:38:58.620]  top rate of gravity if that filters one is better at this and there's better at that
[1:38:58.620 --> 1:39:06.420]  but it's all some micron levels it basically takes everything out to non-textable levels
[1:39:06.420 --> 1:39:14.140]  but again david hog attacked me and said jones says that water has chemicals in it that
[1:39:14.140 --> 1:39:18.900]  turns the frogs gay first it's great let's turn everything gay and i was like yay and
[1:39:18.900 --> 1:39:25.260]  then he goes but then he sells filters again in his mind he thinks i'm trying to scare
[1:39:25.260 --> 1:39:31.420]  you to sell you a filter no i fund myself selling you filters that i use and yeah it's
[1:39:31.420 --> 1:39:35.900]  a symbiotic relationship but to him everything's so predatory it must be predatory and he
[1:39:35.900 --> 1:39:45.340]  thinks it's a joke to filter his water but actually i bet you money that he's filtering
[1:39:45.340 --> 1:39:55.420]  his water like the establishment's obsessed with it but that's just the mindset i mean
[1:39:55.420 --> 1:40:02.220]  how would you have a child and not filter their water or their shower you're like well i don't
[1:40:02.220 --> 1:40:06.900]  have the money oh i bet you've got the money and listen don't get it from me go look at
[1:40:06.900 --> 1:40:13.660]  high end gravity filters and then get them for your family we just sell them at the lowest
[1:40:13.660 --> 1:40:19.300]  price you're gonna find and listen if you're gonna use reverse osmosis you need to get
[1:40:19.300 --> 1:40:28.260]  a quality mineral pill mineral supplement that you take a couple times a week at least
[1:40:28.260 --> 1:40:36.580]  because reverse osmosis is great but it's almost as pure as distilled and both of the
[1:40:36.580 --> 1:40:43.660]  waters basically act as distillates that's not the word it's they're they're they're
[1:40:43.660 --> 1:40:48.100]  they're key laders and they take stuff out of your body and can really hurt you i know
[1:40:48.100 --> 1:40:52.460]  people that have done nothing but drink there's still water on these cleanses and they almost
[1:40:52.460 --> 1:40:59.180]  died i know a well-known sports guy that owns a big company here in town and he almost died
[1:40:59.180 --> 1:41:06.780]  in two weeks drinking um still water and people told him they said that'll kill you he didn't
[1:41:06.780 --> 1:41:11.260]  listen to him he thought oh that's not true i'm gonna detoxify my body now it'll it'll
[1:41:11.260 --> 1:41:16.380]  kill you so again we promote whatever the best is and i'm telling you if you're drinking
[1:41:16.380 --> 1:41:22.060]  tap water you're nuts you're crazy now if you turn reverse osmosis on you're sink to
[1:41:22.060 --> 1:41:27.700]  fill up something you're gonna say boil you know beans in or something that's great that's
[1:41:27.700 --> 1:41:33.060]  fine because the beans already have minerals and stuff in them it's just straight drinking
[1:41:33.060 --> 1:41:40.660]  reverse osmosis is crazy and but the stuff they have been showers the better filters
[1:41:40.660 --> 1:41:44.740]  are close are basically a three-stage filter you're like well it cuts down my flow rate
[1:41:44.740 --> 1:41:48.100]  well the ones we sell don't cut it down that much i'm just telling you folks the skin's
[1:41:48.100 --> 1:41:52.060]  your biggest organ and they're attacking you through the damn water and in my house we've
[1:41:52.060 --> 1:41:56.700]  got shower filters we've got gravity filters also have reverse osmosis for cooking and
[1:41:56.700 --> 1:42:01.800]  we also have i like mountain valley spring is just one of the best tested things that
[1:42:01.800 --> 1:42:07.740]  arkansas it's a good tasting sweet water that i just enjoy like a coca-cola and i don't
[1:42:07.740 --> 1:42:12.500]  mean to pontificate about all this but everybody should really focus on water it's 70% of your
[1:42:12.500 --> 1:42:16.460]  body roughly and then you should really focus on what's in that water and you should focus
[1:42:16.460 --> 1:42:21.180]  on what does my body have to have well it operates off iodine just like if you don't
[1:42:21.180 --> 1:42:24.460]  have vitamin c you end up dying well if you don't have iodine you end up dying and the
[1:42:24.460 --> 1:42:29.380]  enemy knows that and so they're feeding you and pushing you things and most people have
[1:42:29.380 --> 1:42:32.820]  a major iodine deficiency that's why they don't have energy that's why they don't have
[1:42:32.820 --> 1:42:36.620]  stamina libido focus because you can take all the herbs and all the stuff all day if
[1:42:36.620 --> 1:42:41.660]  you don't have iodine and things like b12 is your base these are things you gotta have
[1:42:41.660 --> 1:42:49.700]  you can't do anything it was how are you bouncing off the walls how did you work 20 hours yesterday
[1:42:49.700 --> 1:42:55.180]  i worked 20 hours and then i slept for four and a half hours and i got up and i'm here
[1:42:55.180 --> 1:43:00.540]  how did i do it because i took iodine yesterday and i took it today and i took ultra 12 and

[1:44:13.260 --> 1:44:18.460]  is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not
[1:44:18.460 --> 1:44:23.980]  just here in the u.s. worldwide and president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting
[1:44:23.980 --> 1:44:30.660]  americana and basic liberty is amazing as well he's still lacking on the big tech censorship
[1:44:30.660 --> 1:44:35.140]  taking action against that in some other areas but trying to end the wars boosting our economy
[1:44:35.140 --> 1:44:39.820]  speaking out against communist china trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than
[1:44:39.820 --> 1:44:46.220]  ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective and
[1:44:46.220 --> 1:44:51.380]  the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way and so we're
[1:44:51.380 --> 1:44:55.860]  going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let ourselves get
[1:44:55.860 --> 1:45:01.180]  down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize us
[1:45:01.180 --> 1:45:09.300]  we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy globalism was doomed to fail
[1:45:09.300 --> 1:45:15.700]  if we just exposed it and then resisted it didn't i say a thousand times that there's
[1:45:15.700 --> 1:45:18.740]  no way you're gonna have an authoritarian corporate world government above the law that
[1:45:18.740 --> 1:45:23.100]  doesn't pay taxes that has diplomatic immunity that runs around saying it's communist and
[1:45:23.100 --> 1:45:28.420]  socialist power to the people but then meanwhile is tax exempt again offshore well trump got
[1:45:28.420 --> 1:45:33.580]  that and all these other populace get it why would you throw away wealthy successful countries
[1:45:33.580 --> 1:45:38.740]  and cultures just so you could say the communist chinese that david rockefeller put in power
[1:45:38.740 --> 1:45:45.580]  are better than everybody that is a sick freakish joke and i will not stand by and watch humanity
[1:45:45.580 --> 1:45:51.020]  turned over to these people and i beg god for the strength and the will to have the discernment
[1:45:51.020 --> 1:45:56.140]  to help me part of their defeat and i've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years and god
[1:45:56.140 --> 1:46:01.940]  is delivering because god is great thank god for his son jesus christ and now let's move
[1:46:01.940 --> 1:46:07.300]  forward against the nw
[1:46:07.300 --> 1:46:11.420]  china was already running the united states you're like well china could never take it
[1:46:11.420 --> 1:46:18.100]  with the us that's right as the roman historian and senator cicero warned a powerful empire
[1:46:18.100 --> 1:46:25.060]  can't fall from without before it first falls from within so yes they're coming for your
[1:46:25.060 --> 1:46:29.980]  guns all of them yes they're coming for your children they've already taken your speech
[1:46:29.980 --> 1:46:36.100]  almost everywhere except pockets of resistance like info wars dot com and band on video so
[1:46:36.100 --> 1:46:41.820]  now you know why i'm so upset now you know why i'm so angry i saw the producers of south
[1:46:41.820 --> 1:46:46.740]  park on tv they're totally pissing angry people like why are they angry because they see all
[1:46:46.740 --> 1:46:52.420]  of their freedom their american freedom hard fought taken away are you gonna get upset
[1:46:52.420 --> 1:46:56.740]  well you're a listener you're obviously are upset but you've got to ring the alarm everywhere
[1:46:56.740 --> 1:47:01.300]  until others they've got to get upset and then take action and let congress everybody else
[1:47:01.300 --> 1:47:09.700]  know that we're not backing down and we're not going to sell america to the tricombs
[1:47:09.700 --> 1:47:25.900]  you're listening to the alex jones show we are on the march the empire is on the run
[1:47:25.900 --> 1:47:33.980]  you're listening to the alex jones show america is reawakening humanity finding their own self
[1:47:33.980 --> 1:47:39.660]  determination and getting back to what makes sense common sense is on the march the globalist
[1:47:39.660 --> 1:47:47.460]  technocracy is now beginning to meet its match and it's going to be an incredible struggle
[1:47:47.460 --> 1:47:51.700]  now i said i was an open the phones up for people that disagreed with me that trump shouldn't
[1:47:51.700 --> 1:47:55.540]  be impeached people that think you should be impeached and we got a whole bunch of calls
[1:47:55.540 --> 1:48:01.580]  but only two people said that trump should be impeached i want to give you a chance to
[1:48:01.580 --> 1:48:05.180]  explain to me but but i went to break earlier a few segments ago and forgot to come back
[1:48:05.180 --> 1:48:10.780]  and talk about what i was going to talk about so when we put these videos at band dot video
[1:48:10.780 --> 1:48:15.220]  later when we cut up clips from the show we'll probably need to add a few minutes of this
[1:48:15.220 --> 1:48:23.860]  to segment five of hour one and segment one of hour two add a little book end here on
[1:48:23.860 --> 1:48:36.260]  this on the end of segment two of two so that'll be segment five of hour one with segment one
[1:48:36.260 --> 1:48:45.220]  of hour two and then segment two of hour two and then we'll just put this little piece
[1:48:45.220 --> 1:48:49.300]  right on the end of that so it'll be complete when we put it out because i always forget
[1:48:49.300 --> 1:48:55.860]  sometimes to break down what it is i want to you know finally finish up and cover and
[1:48:55.860 --> 1:49:03.220]  really get to the meat and potatoes of what's happening but here it is the united states
[1:49:03.220 --> 1:49:09.900]  goes around the world and we pay for everything these multinational corporations so well they
[1:49:09.900 --> 1:49:14.780]  debilitate us put us into debt less than american power and we get discredited because they're
[1:49:14.780 --> 1:49:22.940]  doing bad things in our name they then are tax exempt offshore and they have us pay for
[1:49:22.940 --> 1:49:32.660]  their security and so a lot of people used to point out that oh the left's wrong us companies
[1:49:32.660 --> 1:49:43.700]  didn't get any money out of iraq from oil china and the e you and japan and the koreas
[1:49:43.700 --> 1:49:51.100]  got the oil and that's true because that was the globalist agreement the u.s. companies
[1:49:51.100 --> 1:49:58.580]  got the weapons sales but that's another example of how we take over afghanistan we lose thousands
[1:49:58.580 --> 1:50:07.820]  and thousands of troops we're there 18 years almost 19 years we spend over trillion dollars
[1:50:07.820 --> 1:50:12.660]  and china is there getting all the rare earth minerals that go into all of the gadgetry all
[1:50:12.660 --> 1:50:17.380]  the computers all the smart houses all the crap that surveils us and spies on us it doesn't
[1:50:17.380 --> 1:50:28.020]  work at the time cell phones the the rings the iPads the smart refrigerators the smart
[1:50:28.020 --> 1:50:34.860]  light bulbs that are spying on you smart means raping you and so that's really the book
[1:50:34.860 --> 1:50:43.700]  in there is that trump's talking about how we have secured the oil and then he's talking
[1:50:43.700 --> 1:50:48.380]  about it maybe the u.s. will get some of that you know as a fair price the Kurds will have
[1:50:48.380 --> 1:50:51.900]  a little bit of the oil the syrians will have most of it and the Turks will have some of
[1:50:51.900 --> 1:50:56.020]  it and these are areas they've historically the Kurds have been in historically the Turks
[1:50:56.020 --> 1:51:00.300]  have been in and Syria gets most of what Syria was and this country isn't broken into three
[1:51:00.300 --> 1:51:05.940]  big chunks where they'll keep fighting it's one big chunk with two little pieces cut off
[1:51:05.940 --> 1:51:12.140]  and that's a pretty fair deal if you studied it and we're getting out of it and then instead
[1:51:12.140 --> 1:51:21.620]  of paying for the troops we'll just get the oil and we won't take it they'll sell it to
[1:51:21.620 --> 1:51:28.660]  us and they'll sell it to whoever wants to buy it just like the u.s. is now the world's
[1:51:28.660 --> 1:51:35.820]  net exporter for the biggest exporter of oil and that's happened under Trump because
[1:51:35.820 --> 1:51:40.340]  he took the restraints off that were designed to keep us from being competitive all the
[1:51:40.340 --> 1:51:44.140]  environmental stuff still there basically but the rules making it where we couldn't
[1:51:44.140 --> 1:51:48.020]  compete those are being removed and that's another reason the globalists are so angry
[1:51:48.020 --> 1:51:52.740]  because these average liberals are conservative leaders they're invested in China and overseas
[1:51:52.740 --> 1:51:56.940]  they've got a deal where America goes down their investments go up the American centuries
[1:51:56.940 --> 1:52:04.340]  over the chai comm centuries here so we'll go to Patty and Toby here in a moment but
[1:52:04.340 --> 1:52:12.180]  since we mentioned this it all ties together we saw the Rockets general manager come out
[1:52:12.180 --> 1:52:17.020]  and say that he supports Hong Kong freedom and then we saw the head of the NBA come
[1:52:17.020 --> 1:52:21.260]  out and say well we don't want to get the middle of it and blah blah blah there was
[1:52:21.260 --> 1:52:26.060]  a big backlash so then he mildly criticized the chai comms well now he's come out the
[1:52:26.060 --> 1:52:32.180]  articles on it for us.com and news wars.com China secretly ordered NBA commissioner to
[1:52:32.180 --> 1:52:42.300]  fire Rockets general manager over Hong Kong tweet and Adam Silver addressed the fallout
[1:52:42.300 --> 1:52:48.340]  the fact that he said that's not American values now is this even true who knows but
[1:52:48.340 --> 1:52:54.260]  we know why he's doing it it turns out they've lost a lot of money and they know they go
[1:52:54.260 --> 1:53:02.220]  down this path Americans are going to desert them even faster it's the big shoe companies
[1:53:02.220 --> 1:53:07.220]  that make hundreds of billions a year globally and most of them are made in China very hard
[1:53:07.220 --> 1:53:12.860]  to find shoes that aren't made in there I'm wearing shoes made in Vietnam for some American
[1:53:12.860 --> 1:53:19.260]  brands I do buy cowboy boots and work boots and some things like that but just for shoes
[1:53:19.260 --> 1:53:23.980]  that actually work pretty good or modern tennis shoes I'm wearing some asics right now those
[1:53:23.980 --> 1:53:28.500]  are made in Vietnam who's basically a war with China right now but the point is I'm
[1:53:28.500 --> 1:53:31.940]  not against the Vietnamese people the Chinese people if they've got any type of basic future
[1:53:31.940 --> 1:53:38.420]  any basic wage Vietnam by the way is booming they're moving away from communism or moving
[1:53:38.420 --> 1:53:46.340]  towards it but this shows the power of the people if we exercise our will over the chai
[1:53:46.340 --> 1:53:51.220]  comms but it shows behind the scenes and they admit this they want to force other countries
[1:53:51.220 --> 1:53:55.260]  and corporations to adopt the communist chai comm model and they believe they're going
[1:53:55.260 --> 1:54:00.700]  to rule the world and the CFR and others have told them they are going to rule the world
[1:54:00.700 --> 1:54:07.540]  well the last time we heard that was the Soviet Union and before that it was it was it was
[1:54:07.540 --> 1:54:13.780]  Fidel Castro that was going to rule the Caribbean and it was Hitler that was going to rule the
[1:54:13.780 --> 1:54:18.900]  world for a thousand years and it just never ends good it's very very dangerous you know
[1:54:18.900 --> 1:54:23.540]  there's another article I forgot to get it was from last night one in fours dot com just
[1:54:23.540 --> 1:54:30.100]  so many articles extinction rebellion head whatever the hell it's called the group that
[1:54:30.100 --> 1:54:34.900]  takes over and blocks everything around the world they admit it we're here to make heterosexuality
[1:54:34.900 --> 1:54:41.180]  abnormal and reduce population and climate change isn't real it's our excuse to stop
[1:54:41.180 --> 1:54:45.940]  humans there it is extinction rebellion so founders as climate protests is about ending
[1:54:45.940 --> 1:54:52.580]  idea heterosexuality is normal it's not about the climate see of course it's not it's about
[1:54:52.580 --> 1:55:03.300]  them dictating and some weird anti-human cult run by Peter Singer who founded PETA with his
[1:55:03.300 --> 1:55:08.980]  Ingrid Newhouse's her name oh I've read the writings of singer he says kill kids up to
[1:55:08.980 --> 1:55:14.380]  age three why do you think the left now says kill kids up to age three this is their religion
[1:55:14.380 --> 1:55:20.420]  and it's an anti-heterosexual anti-human thing so I can say hey I don't care if you're a
[1:55:20.420 --> 1:55:26.020]  homosexual but then now when you're in that club oh you gotta be by the way signed onto
[1:55:26.020 --> 1:55:32.220]  anti god anti-family all this and now they're admitting that's the plan but I digress here's
[1:55:32.220 --> 1:55:42.860]  a clip of the NBA commissioner obviously we made clear that we were being asked to fire
[1:55:42.860 --> 1:55:49.260]  him by the Chinese government by the parties we dealt with government and business we said
[1:55:49.260 --> 1:55:54.420]  there's no chance that's happening there's no chance we'll even discipline him so in
[1:55:54.420 --> 1:56:00.180]  that context I was saying on one hand we were supporting free expression but again maybe
[1:56:00.180 --> 1:56:05.380]  I was trying too hard to be a diplomat obviously we made clear that yeah maybe I was trying
[1:56:05.380 --> 1:56:09.460]  to be a diplomat you can see the whole 15 minute interview in this article at info wars
[1:56:09.460 --> 1:56:14.620]  dot com and again every article you send out every video you send out is an act of resistance
[1:56:14.620 --> 1:56:22.060]  that has a huge effect when you get excited about videos they get 200 300 400,000 sometimes
[1:56:22.060 --> 1:56:26.460]  a million views at Bandai video when you don't the average video gets about 15,000 views
[1:56:26.460 --> 1:56:31.380]  that's fine that's still a huge crowd of people you know Obama gives speeches now on YouTube
[1:56:31.380 --> 1:56:35.300]  and 5,000 people end up watching it in a week and that's why they wanted us off air back
[1:56:35.300 --> 1:56:39.180]  when our average video was getting a million views but it doesn't matter we already woke
[1:56:39.180 --> 1:56:43.620]  a lot of people up and when I went to that Trump rally last night 70% of people were
[1:56:43.620 --> 1:56:49.300]  listeners black, white, old, young, high-fiving and they're doing shows now and they're involved
[1:56:49.300 --> 1:56:54.820]  in their hand sharing the show from Bandai video and info wars dot com for its last show
[1:56:54.820 --> 1:57:00.780]  but make no mistake there is a literal war to silence info wars because it's seen as
[1:57:00.780 --> 1:57:08.220]  a populist voice it's seen as the Paul Revere focal point igniting the minds and the actions
[1:57:08.220 --> 1:57:13.060]  and the will of other Paul Revere's across the country and across the world because when
[1:57:13.060 --> 1:57:18.300]  I say 1776 worldwide I don't mean Americana forcing itself worldwide I mean the idea of
[1:57:18.300 --> 1:57:25.020]  self-determination and the real renaissance worldwide of human freedom the left is an
[1:57:25.020 --> 1:57:30.380]  authoritarian takeover it knows it's an authoritarian takeover and we'll take your phone calls if
[1:57:30.380 --> 1:57:33.380]  you disagree with me I think Trump should be impeached I want to hear from you from

[1:58:04.860 --> 1:58:09.940]  all of it that's why they took me off the air first and banned me across the internet
[1:58:09.940 --> 1:58:14.460]  because they knew that what we were saying was dead on and they didn't want us raising
[1:58:14.460 --> 1:58:18.500]  the alarm well guess what thanks to you spreading the word instead of fastly supporting info

[1:59:46.780 --> 2:00:03.500]  challenge at info was live dot com you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:44:05.360 --> 2:01:09.900]  then we're going to open the phones up to everybody just about what what
[2:01:09.900 --> 2:01:15.180]  you make of the fog of war and that we're in really a form of civil war and the left
[2:01:15.180 --> 2:01:22.060]  is just bullying and threatening and attacking and having fake secret tribunals in the Congress
[2:01:22.060 --> 2:01:28.580]  that Republicans can attend and they're getting ready for a trial before Thanksgiving and
[2:01:28.580 --> 2:01:33.420]  then starting the trial in the Senate and having it done by Christmas hell now they're
[2:01:33.420 --> 2:01:42.220]  saying trial done by Thanksgiving I don't think that's going to happen but this is
[2:01:42.220 --> 2:01:49.220]  very serious I mean they don't have the former head of CIA assassinations counterterrorism
[2:01:49.220 --> 2:01:52.840]  was called Phil mud on TV saying we're going to kill the president if they're not trying
[2:01:52.840 --> 2:01:58.180]  to telegraph that it gets my to do it I mean if I went on air and said I'm not saying this
[2:01:58.180 --> 2:02:04.900]  because I'll edit and say I said that I came on air and said with Phil mud saying there's
[2:02:04.900 --> 2:02:08.660]  somebody needs to kill the president so I need to go do it people take that from authority
[2:02:08.660 --> 2:02:14.980]  figures like it's okay to carry it out I would get in trouble and I should I mean I've melted
[2:02:14.980 --> 2:02:19.540]  down and yelled and screamed before and said I'd like to catch who's sending us child porn
[2:02:19.540 --> 2:02:23.100]  and trying to plan it on our servers when I find out I'm going to put their head on
[2:02:23.100 --> 2:02:28.140]  a pike that's all figurative I was also screaming about these lawyers clearly wasn't talking
[2:02:28.140 --> 2:02:34.060]  about them and they ran around saying I was threatening them but then when the left clearly
[2:02:34.060 --> 2:02:39.660]  threatens people and the last thing I do was sit there and actually say I want physical
[2:02:39.660 --> 2:02:43.860]  violence against these people because that's what they do I'm not stupid got a level and
[2:02:43.860 --> 2:02:48.420]  I don't want to make them martyrs look the only way they could win right now is assassinating
[2:02:48.420 --> 2:02:57.860]  Hillary and blaming it on us and so the idea that I want violence the idea that I'm pushing
[2:02:57.860 --> 2:03:02.940]  violence the idea that patriots are doing that is just as an eye and it's the left assaulting
[2:03:02.940 --> 2:03:09.980]  and harassing people but you turn on the news and people are saying oh Trump supporters
[2:03:09.980 --> 2:03:13.500]  are attacking people all over America and Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett go up and
[2:03:13.500 --> 2:03:21.780]  talk to these people and they look at them and they tell them oh I've seen you Trump
[2:03:21.780 --> 2:03:27.060]  supporters you're assaulting people I saw it on the news and Millie Weaver in one video
[2:03:27.060 --> 2:03:30.620]  that's up on in Forest today she goes this is just last night she goes where'd you see
[2:03:30.620 --> 2:03:35.620]  that she goes I saw it on CNN in Minneapolis well we've seen all the footage in Minneapolis
[2:03:35.620 --> 2:03:42.660]  it's leftist attacking men women and children attacking the police viciously slapping women
[2:03:42.660 --> 2:03:46.980]  in the face hitting people in the face from behind hitting people in the head from mine
[2:03:46.980 --> 2:03:53.260]  and but when you talk to a leftist they go I've seen your violence and Trump's a Nazi
[2:03:53.260 --> 2:03:57.420]  and I had a bunch of anti for following me when I was ready to go they always want to
[2:03:57.420 --> 2:04:01.140]  follow you and then have the fake victory that you've left they'll wait to leave a restaurant
[2:04:01.140 --> 2:04:04.780]  and scream get out of here get out of here you're paying your check or walk on the front
[2:04:04.780 --> 2:04:10.620]  door they follow me back to the parked armored vehicle we came in just for fun because that's
[2:04:10.620 --> 2:04:14.900]  what the security company we hired is we got an armored suburban we got an armored you
[2:04:14.900 --> 2:04:18.700]  know truck which one do you want to say I said armored truck just got a turret in the
[2:04:18.700 --> 2:04:23.420]  top right and you know drive around bull herring it's great so they're they follow us about
[2:04:23.420 --> 2:04:32.140]  half mile back the truck and I started chanting the stuff about how the Democrats founded
[2:04:32.140 --> 2:04:38.020]  the KKK now I stand against white supremacist and a bunch of them looked at me real weird
[2:04:38.020 --> 2:04:44.940]  and stopped because this was the lowest level Antifa actually about half of them actually
[2:04:44.940 --> 2:04:48.860]  were Hispanic and black and stuff and they were being directed by the other Antifa that
[2:04:48.860 --> 2:04:54.180]  were college professors and people in mass and they were like huh they're like huh well
[2:04:54.180 --> 2:04:57.940]  you don't hate us and I said no you've been lied to them oh that's on video too and I'm
[2:04:57.940 --> 2:05:02.300]  like yeah dude they couldn't believe I was saying down with the KKK they just they went
[2:05:02.300 --> 2:05:07.140]  oh we're sorry they really believed I was KKK I've got to really hand it to the listeners
[2:05:07.140 --> 2:05:13.580]  and viewers who enforce your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge
[2:05:13.580 --> 2:05:18.340]  to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the
[2:05:18.340 --> 2:05:25.020]  U.S. worldwide and President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic
[2:05:25.020 --> 2:05:31.020]  liberty is amazing as well he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against
[2:05:31.020 --> 2:05:35.100]  that in some other areas but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out
[2:05:35.100 --> 2:05:40.700]  against communist China Trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really
[2:05:40.700 --> 2:05:46.220]  have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists
[2:05:46.220 --> 2:05:51.340]  are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some
[2:05:51.340 --> 2:05:56.660]  major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see
[2:05:56.660 --> 2:06:01.900]  all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember
[2:06:01.900 --> 2:06:23.540]  that and stay focused and stay happy rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty
[2:06:23.540 --> 2:06:39.780]  it's alex jones
[2:06:39.780 --> 2:07:03.720]  we've got to do
[2:07:03.720 --> 2:07:10.040]  The raw footage is all posted on info wars calm drudge report calm at least the last time I checked had it right in the middle
[2:07:10.360 --> 2:07:13.920]  So you can find our updated page. That's updating with all the footage
[2:07:14.240 --> 2:07:18.840]  It's just crazy stuff. You're there. It is Alex Jones attends Dallas rally an armored vehicle
[2:07:19.600 --> 2:07:21.000]  and
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:23.640]  We should probably just add to the subhead line that
[2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:27.000]  It is being continuously updated
[2:07:27.640 --> 2:07:31.600]  Also a man with a gun wearing helmet vest arrested outside event
[2:07:31.600 --> 2:07:34.320]  And he was wearing an info wars shirt
[2:07:35.040 --> 2:07:39.680]  And it turns out Owen was able to get contacted by him. I've invited the fellow on the show
[2:07:39.680 --> 2:07:41.200]  I haven't gotten word back yet
[2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:47.680]  And it turns out he was just there case anti-foot attacked exercising a second amendment was not planning anything violent was nowhere near the president
[2:07:48.040 --> 2:07:54.480]  But it turns out that it's not fake news. The gentleman says he was wearing an info wars shirt. I guess under his jacket
[2:07:55.160 --> 2:07:58.080]  But they sure made that into a big deal
[2:07:58.080 --> 2:08:00.080]  So
[2:08:00.120 --> 2:08:04.120]  Not everything's a false flag ladies and gentlemen, so we checked into it and that's a real report
[2:08:06.320 --> 2:08:11.040]  ABC's normally telling you that Trump's you know vaporizing the Kurds with 5,000 foot red
[2:08:11.640 --> 2:08:13.640]  Mushroom clouds. That's not true
[2:08:13.760 --> 2:08:18.120]  But we should have that HD footage some clips for you by the end of this hour
[2:08:18.440 --> 2:08:23.920]  If not, I will commend here some of poor Nick baggage's precious time. He loves to do the show
[2:08:23.920 --> 2:08:27.360]  He knows he can get preempted and he's a good friend of mine going back 20 years
[2:08:27.360 --> 2:08:31.840]  But there's just so much breaking news on Fridays. It's just crazy and if stuff breaks
[2:08:31.840 --> 2:08:34.640]  I'll be back here tomorrow because I'm committed to win this, you know
[2:08:34.640 --> 2:08:39.480]  We've been in a long fight against the globalist and we've gotten so far now that globalism is in trouble
[2:08:39.520 --> 2:08:44.760]  Their systems been exposed. They don't know what to do. They're censoring which is blowing up in their face
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:49.080]  We're forcing a major debate about which side are they on the chai comms or Americana
[2:08:49.800 --> 2:08:56.020]  We're dictating the future because no one else never challenged these corporations. They the world was asleep
[2:08:56.020 --> 2:08:58.020]  we're not asleep anymore and
[2:08:58.860 --> 2:09:04.620]  So now though is the time to really work the hardest ever because we're barely winning
[2:09:05.700 --> 2:09:07.700]  And we're coming from behind
[2:09:08.900 --> 2:09:12.620]  We've now crossed the 50% mark and we're 52% ahead
[2:09:14.100 --> 2:09:16.700]  Well, that's not having it in the bag folks
[2:09:17.980 --> 2:09:21.900]  Okay, and again, it doesn't mean some utopia is about to happen. I'm offering some utopia
[2:09:21.900 --> 2:09:28.860]  The world's not perfect, but we can go for people to be in positions of leadership that actually care about humanity and
[2:09:29.180 --> 2:09:31.180]  Produce results and then go off
[2:09:31.660 --> 2:09:37.260]  Someone keeping their promises and someone fighting hard to deliver on what they've said they do
[2:09:37.260 --> 2:09:39.700]  I mean if people don't appreciate that
[2:09:40.300 --> 2:09:44.300]  Then you deserve what you can't and so for me, it's bittersweet. I
[2:09:45.860 --> 2:09:48.900]  Love Trump. He's done an amazing job on so many fronts
[2:09:48.900 --> 2:09:53.180]  But he's not stood up for the persecution of his supporters
[2:09:53.660 --> 2:09:58.900]  He hardly ever talks about how they get beat up outside of the arenas because he thinks that will scare people away
[2:09:58.900 --> 2:10:01.340]  He'd say don't let these bullies stop you more need to come
[2:10:01.580 --> 2:10:04.180]  I'm gonna have a rally in a hundred thousand, you know group
[2:10:04.180 --> 2:10:10.060]  He's to call their bluff and he needs to speak out against the censorship and Brad Parskill needs to and
[2:10:10.740 --> 2:10:12.180]  I
[2:10:12.180 --> 2:10:14.260]  Mean if they don't do that and they leave us out
[2:10:14.260 --> 2:10:22.540]  To dry it's it's just not right and I know Trump is not a singali. He's not Houdini. He's not perfect, but I
[2:10:26.380 --> 2:10:31.860]  Think Matt drudge is right to show how much trouble Trump's in because I don't think Trump's figured it out
[2:10:33.060 --> 2:10:35.060]  And I think that
[2:10:35.100 --> 2:10:37.740]  Everybody being overconfident that nothing's gonna happen to Trump
[2:10:37.740 --> 2:10:43.500]  That sounds like you know, nothing's gonna happen to the Titanic either. It's bad luck folks. Okay, and
[2:10:47.180 --> 2:10:51.340]  It's a big debate about what's drudge doing well drudge will show what they're saying and then he'll show what Trump's saying
[2:10:51.340 --> 2:10:54.460]  And then when it turns out Trump's right, he'll show it. I mean, it's still
[2:10:55.540 --> 2:11:00.140]  70% pro-trump. I think it's pretty boring to have a page that just supports the president
[2:11:00.140 --> 2:11:05.420]  I mean, we have the enemy up on our site and I see people going. What do you have this Hillary speech on here?
[2:11:05.420 --> 2:11:11.780]  We don't need to hear from her. You don't need to hear from her saying she may get back in the race and saying she won the last election and
[2:11:12.540 --> 2:11:14.540]  Saying she wants to censor people. I mean
[2:11:15.100 --> 2:11:19.860]  They're I'm not saying the general audience is like this, but we do have folks on M4s and people that talked to the street
[2:11:19.860 --> 2:11:21.860]  They say hey, you know
[2:11:22.180 --> 2:11:25.820]  Trump's invincible. I mean, I like Jesse James. He's a friend of mine. He's been demonized the news
[2:11:25.820 --> 2:11:29.540]  None of it's true. He ended up moving in next because I got to be good friends with him years ago, but
[2:11:30.140 --> 2:11:33.700]  You know, he's always like I'd probably fine. Don't worry Alex. Come on. Everything's wonderful
[2:11:33.700 --> 2:11:39.620]  and you know, I just don't have that type of confidence I need to fight to make sure we get in the position so we don't go there and
[2:11:42.420 --> 2:11:44.420]  That's all I'm saying and
[2:11:46.620 --> 2:11:48.620]  Trump can really be criticized
[2:11:49.380 --> 2:11:50.660]  for
[2:11:50.660 --> 2:11:52.660]  Just letting 5g come in
[2:11:52.660 --> 2:11:58.540]  For not stopping the vaccines. He knows almost, you know killed Baron really messed him up for a while Baron bounced back
[2:11:58.900 --> 2:12:00.700]  a lot of folks don't
[2:12:00.700 --> 2:12:06.860]  Plus Trump has got knowledge on the right stuff to do and and how you can change the gut flora and bill him on the gates
[2:12:06.860 --> 2:12:09.580]  No, all that stuff and I just this is big. This is a big deal and
[2:12:11.260 --> 2:12:14.460]  They intend to take Trump out just because their reasons are fake
[2:12:15.460 --> 2:12:17.460]  doesn't mean anything and
[2:12:18.380 --> 2:12:22.260]  So I support what he's done in Syria. I think it's wonderful. I just think that
[2:12:22.260 --> 2:12:30.500]  We better not be like the left and live in a bubble and I think making this show not a bubble is
[2:12:31.220 --> 2:12:33.220]  Important, that's why I sound people to call and disagree
[2:12:33.900 --> 2:12:40.420]  Let's go to Cody in Canada and then Bill in Kansas and then Toby patty and Matt and you guys say you want Trump and Peach
[2:12:40.420 --> 2:12:42.420]  Go ahead Cody
[2:12:45.740 --> 2:12:47.740]  Sounds like it's raining
[2:12:48.420 --> 2:12:50.780]  You know, this white noise might put me to sleep I
[2:12:50.780 --> 2:12:52.780]  Sleep with white noise
[2:12:53.980 --> 2:12:55.980]  Just like this
[2:12:56.980 --> 2:13:03.500]  It's just like rain coming down so hard. I want to keep that going. No, no, I like that
[2:13:07.660 --> 2:13:09.660]  There you go
[2:13:12.540 --> 2:13:18.220]  Yeah, you go to YouTube it's got white noise and it'll like to go a hundred million views ten hours of white noise
[2:13:18.220 --> 2:13:25.180]  We can just record ten hours of this and then put a pillow commercial at the front of it and make a million dollars. Oh
[2:13:28.140 --> 2:13:31.540]  My goodness Bill in Kansas. You're on the air. Welcome
[2:13:38.140 --> 2:13:43.980]  Like I said, we got a new way of doing things around here folks and these it's just been magic around here lately
[2:13:44.900 --> 2:13:46.900]  But I like it. I
[2:13:46.900 --> 2:13:50.700]  Don't get mad anymore about technical difficulties. I just
[2:13:55.900 --> 2:14:00.580]  Okay, well, you got to know you know what the gambler says you got to know when to hold them
[2:14:00.740 --> 2:14:05.980]  You got to know when to fold them. You got to know when to walk away. You got to know when to run
[2:14:06.620 --> 2:14:10.940]  So we're we're done with calls that that will we'll cut the white noise off at that point
[2:14:10.940 --> 2:14:16.900]  But I've had the power to do that these days, you know, who knows it's it's equipment. You know, it's all that equipment
[2:14:18.100 --> 2:14:24.940]  It's a daisy, isn't it now? I have a lot of really powerful reports that I haven't even aired
[2:14:25.940 --> 2:14:27.540]  because
[2:14:27.540 --> 2:14:29.540]  they're long and
[2:14:31.100 --> 2:14:31.980]  I
[2:14:31.980 --> 2:14:34.660]  Don't want to not do them justice and then just you know
[2:14:35.180 --> 2:14:37.300]  Only air five minutes of this or five minutes of that
[2:14:37.300 --> 2:14:41.380]  I want to hear the best parts but really a lot of the intros of these are the best parts
[2:14:41.660 --> 2:14:46.220]  But I really do encourage people to go to Band-Aid video and see this for yourself. I want to come back
[2:14:46.660 --> 2:14:52.460]  I'm going to play some clips of some of the looniest leftist you've ever seen and
[2:14:53.340 --> 2:14:56.700]  Then I'm going to get into some of the other news. I haven't hit yet and then we're going to play
[2:14:57.580 --> 2:15:01.580]  The video the condensed down video. There's hours of it of Antifa
[2:15:01.580 --> 2:15:08.020]  Threading to kill me and spitting at me and attacking me and the Dallas police standing down. It's pretty noteworthy that families are trying
[2:15:08.020 --> 2:15:10.700]  To go to these Trump rallies and this is what's going on outside
[2:15:10.700 --> 2:15:16.180]  And then after the events they try to follow the families out to their cars to attack them
[2:15:16.180 --> 2:15:22.660]  So that people get scared to don't support Trump because the last thing they want people to see is the image
[2:15:23.980 --> 2:15:25.980]  out there of
[2:15:25.980 --> 2:15:32.220]  People that support Trump. They want to gaslight everybody in a big cult that no one supports
[2:15:33.060 --> 2:15:38.660]  And then threaten those that are prominent and have big voices that are supporting him and make our lives living hell
[2:15:38.660 --> 2:15:42.700]  And then Trump doesn't do anything about that. And so he loses his support
[2:15:43.260 --> 2:15:49.620]  So that's that's the love-hate relationship that's going on there. So when we come back, I don't have a way to describe this
[2:15:49.620 --> 2:15:54.540]  I'm just gonna have to play this video from Millie Weaver when we come back on the other side
[2:15:54.540 --> 2:15:58.660]  And then I'll get to the other news info wars calm news wars calm
[2:15:58.660 --> 2:16:02.420]  It truly is tomorrow's news today and only on air because of your support

[2:16:20.980 --> 2:16:27.460]  That's gonna let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid the clearance price is a result of the historic flooding
[2:16:27.460 --> 2:16:30.980]  We're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi because of the flooding
[2:16:30.980 --> 2:16:36.100]  We've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse
[2:16:36.100 --> 2:16:42.100]  We thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters back story
[2:16:42.100 --> 2:16:47.580]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at my own power grid calm

[2:19:04.020 --> 2:19:09.020]  I've been in this fight so long against the globalists that I forget sometimes
[2:19:09.020 --> 2:19:15.940]  We really came from nowhere and that we've changed the world together and just how important your actions and my actions are

[2:20:04.340 --> 2:20:24.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show I
[2:20:27.700 --> 2:20:29.700]  Want to explain something here on air
[2:20:29.700 --> 2:20:31.700]  I
[2:20:34.060 --> 2:20:40.460]  Don't take pleasure in how dumb down and lazy and stupid the left are and in fact if you can
[2:20:41.060 --> 2:20:46.980]  Figure out how to reverse how the public has become very lethargic very sloth like very stupid on average
[2:20:47.580 --> 2:20:51.140]  And getting stupid about the day you could really save the species
[2:20:52.340 --> 2:20:58.500]  But if you look at the ingenuity the hard work it took to build this civilization the craftsmanship
[2:20:58.500 --> 2:21:08.020]  The dedication and then you have a bunch of savages basically inheriting it white savages black savages brown savages yellow savages
[2:21:08.900 --> 2:21:13.460]  spoil rotten video game players people that don't give a damn about anybody but themselves
[2:21:15.540 --> 2:21:20.580]  All statistics show we're not living as long our IQs are dropping. I don't care what color you are
[2:21:21.420 --> 2:21:23.420]  We're in trouble and
[2:21:23.420 --> 2:21:28.420]  And then the elitists celebrate how dumb the public is and how and how much they can screw them over
[2:21:28.420 --> 2:21:30.420]  I'm not gonna list Obama or Gruber
[2:21:31.100 --> 2:21:35.460]  Or Rahm Emanuel and you people celebrating the public being stupid
[2:21:38.780 --> 2:21:40.780]  That's dangerous and
[2:21:42.460 --> 2:21:46.660]  It's a spirit where people get in to not caring
[2:21:46.660 --> 2:21:54.220]  And well, I'm gonna go to your calls. We got the phone system working. It just had a weird glitch it was hung up
[2:21:54.220 --> 2:21:58.420]  So I apologize two callers were there, but it was just hung up a little digital thing
[2:21:58.420 --> 2:22:00.420]  So it's working now go up next segment, but I
[2:22:01.180 --> 2:22:06.420]  Wanted to just play some of these right now because it's just epic footage at Band-Aid video and when I say that I mean
[2:22:06.420 --> 2:22:09.380]  I was driving home last night watching Tateland Bennett Millie Weaver videos
[2:22:09.460 --> 2:22:14.820]  And they were filing like five of them apiece yesterday and they followed more this morning and just every one of them is
[2:22:14.820 --> 2:22:16.820]  Incredible and they're not
[2:22:17.820 --> 2:22:19.820]  Cherry-picking dumb people here, okay?
[2:22:22.900 --> 2:22:25.300]  They are not cherry-picking any of it
[2:22:29.300 --> 2:22:31.300]  And the numbers show it
[2:22:32.660 --> 2:22:41.620]  People are really stupid now and they're getting stupider and you've seen it and there's a lot of documentaries and books written about it
[2:22:41.620 --> 2:22:46.540]  That Europe and here in the US, but Asia has a lot of lotteries as well
[2:22:46.540 --> 2:22:50.300]  That you'll have some middle-class dude who's been married for 30 years totally happy
[2:22:50.940 --> 2:22:55.020]  At a nice house swimming pool goes on vacations every year kids are in college
[2:22:55.420 --> 2:22:58.860]  He wins a five million dollar lottery and a year later. He's dead
[2:23:01.020 --> 2:23:03.020]  Imprisoned
[2:23:03.260 --> 2:23:05.260]  Bankrupt or a combination of those
[2:23:05.260 --> 2:23:16.620]  In 95% of the cases I mean they basically it's hard to find cases where people get a bunch of money and don't destroy their lives
[2:23:16.620 --> 2:23:18.620]  If they didn't earn it
[2:23:20.460 --> 2:23:22.460]  If they didn't learn how to control it
[2:23:25.420 --> 2:23:32.540]  Money and success will destroy you faster than anything if you're just going for success and money I
[2:23:32.540 --> 2:23:39.900]  Mean you think people like Dan Bilzerian is happy because his daddy gave him a hundred million dollars, whatever
[2:23:42.740 --> 2:23:49.540]  You think these rock stars are happy and they even earned it supposedly no because they're not helping people
[2:23:52.940 --> 2:23:54.940]  So when I see these people
[2:23:57.780 --> 2:24:00.820]  With no attention span lower than a goldfish literally
[2:24:00.820 --> 2:24:04.020]  And I know it's being done by design
[2:24:04.020 --> 2:24:08.340]  But but it's worse than that once you get someone in a smart-ass attitude
[2:24:08.540 --> 2:24:13.460]  Once you get someone in a not caring slacker attitude, you know, I like Rick Linklutter
[2:24:13.460 --> 2:24:16.420]  But he made slackers for his big film and it's celebrated
[2:24:17.260 --> 2:24:22.300]  Being quirky not having any drive because that was really going on with people in Austin
[2:24:22.940 --> 2:24:25.380]  He's not a slacker that works his ass off
[2:24:25.380 --> 2:24:29.940]  But why was that celebrated by the left?
[2:24:32.420 --> 2:24:38.620]  Because they're glorifying being a jellyfish because that's what the system wants they don't want to compete with you
[2:24:40.740 --> 2:24:47.340]  Again you think a male lion wants to compete with other male lions he walks up and he smells the other lions
[2:24:47.340 --> 2:24:54.220]  Sticks his nose right in their crotch to see if it's a boy or a girl and if it's a boy he eats it
[2:24:55.420 --> 2:24:58.300]  That's what the female lions to do is protect the cubs
[2:24:58.780 --> 2:25:03.660]  Not from from hyenas, but from other lions same thing with grizzly bears
[2:25:05.260 --> 2:25:10.860]  And if you take that allegory of this that's how it works meanwhile we have this that I'm just gonna have to describe
[2:25:10.860 --> 2:25:12.860]  This is another Soros funded. I looked it up this morning
[2:25:13.860 --> 2:25:15.180]  group
[2:25:15.180 --> 2:25:19.060]  That's claiming women are oppressed because there's taxes on
[2:25:20.580 --> 2:25:23.380]  Tampons now I'm all for getting rid of taxes
[2:25:24.060 --> 2:25:29.180]  But you don't do it just because someone's a woman or someone's a man you just had to do it across classes and
[2:25:29.940 --> 2:25:35.660]  Say okay. Well all forms of diapers. We're gonna get rid of taxes. Okay. Do that, but don't do it for women
[2:25:36.300 --> 2:25:39.580]  Do it for everybody that creates another discriminatory system
[2:25:39.580 --> 2:25:45.980]  But imagine this is just another insane group with men feminist men. It's like a 15-minute report. They get even crazier
[2:25:46.660 --> 2:25:48.260]  Talking about how
[2:25:48.260 --> 2:25:51.900]  Well, just just hear it from them yourself. Here's Millie Weaver
[2:25:53.180 --> 2:25:58.660]  How did you find out about this movement and get involved with it? So I was co-founder of period
[2:25:59.340 --> 2:26:04.340]  At the Ohio State University and eventually I began working with period nationals a policy coordinator
[2:26:04.340 --> 2:26:09.060]  And now as one of the leaders of the national period day campaign
[2:26:19.740 --> 2:26:25.820]  We are youth friend non-profits celebrating menstruation. We help people with periods people with periods
[2:26:25.940 --> 2:26:30.300]  This is an issue that I believe we can eradicate and that's why we're focused on pushing it forward
[2:26:30.300 --> 2:26:34.620]  Do you think that ending this period tax is gonna help end poverty?
[2:26:35.100 --> 2:26:39.900]  This is this is a form of poverty. So yes hundred percent period poverty is a form of poverty
[2:26:39.900 --> 2:26:44.900]  It's a legitimate form of poverty and working together with all these legislators here in Ohio and across the country
[2:26:44.900 --> 2:26:50.380]  I believe we can do it and and end it. Yeah on Saturday. We're actually having national period day
[2:26:50.420 --> 2:26:57.060]  There's a crisis that's being ignored. It's keeping far too many people away from school one in four women
[2:26:57.060 --> 2:27:01.220]  Can't afford menstrual hygiene products tampons pads
[2:27:02.340 --> 2:27:03.740]  Essentials
[2:27:03.740 --> 2:27:12.460]  Some have to use cardboard instead or toilet paper or even trash if you think it's uncomfortable to talk about period poverty
[2:27:13.420 --> 2:27:20.020]  Imagine the people with cardboard in their underwear. You don't have to have PMS to be pissed off about it
[2:27:20.700 --> 2:27:22.700]  But it helps
[2:27:22.700 --> 2:27:24.980]  46% of women in St. Louis had a
[2:27:24.980 --> 2:27:26.980]  Okay, let's stop right here
[2:27:27.900 --> 2:27:32.300]  You've got toxic waste being dumped in the ocean. You've got 90% nuclear reactors leaking
[2:27:32.300 --> 2:27:37.140]  You've got those huge third world populations ballooning. You've got the Chinese comments putting two million people in death camps
[2:27:37.340 --> 2:27:44.740]  You've got all this going on and they're trying to claim that women are too poor to get tampons and they're inventing this big crisis
[2:27:44.740 --> 2:27:48.380]  But it's really so they can have if you're a realist or you're lucky
[2:27:48.380 --> 2:27:57.180]  show big fat gay men with blood coming out of their nose and other women bleeding and then it cuts to women bleeding out of their crotches to
[2:27:57.900 --> 2:28:06.460]  Just make everything ugly and and and just the left's always obsessed with bathrooms and people's genitals and and and poop and
[2:28:06.740 --> 2:28:10.460]  Urine and blood because they're mentally ill their miscreants and
[2:28:10.820 --> 2:28:15.900]  The CIA under leftist control admitted it was declassified ten years ago that for 40 years
[2:28:15.900 --> 2:28:21.500]  They pushed ugliness in TV ugliness in media. They made the family look bad. They made fathers look stupid
[2:28:22.060 --> 2:28:27.260]  They made ugly architecture and ugly art to make you feel depressed
[2:28:27.740 --> 2:28:30.540]  And in fact, I didn't get to the most important thing yesterday
[2:28:30.860 --> 2:28:33.180]  yesterday was a very important broadcast and
[2:28:33.740 --> 2:28:36.860]  So was the day before but I never got to the record suicides of
[2:28:37.340 --> 2:28:45.100]  Teenagers and the troops and how it's getting worse and then how it shows record use of serotonin reupting inhibitors any depressants
[2:28:45.100 --> 2:28:48.940]  Whose own inserts say they make you commit suicide
[2:28:49.500 --> 2:28:56.300]  So if I don't get to that today, I'm going to get to that on sunday because that's something we can cover to really do something about a real crisis
[2:28:56.940 --> 2:29:03.100]  Not period poverty so much of leftist. You'll film students can splatter blood on their faces
[2:29:04.140 --> 2:29:10.060]  attention gcn self-reliance listeners if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system

[2:29:27.340 --> 2:29:30.860]  We're having here right on the east bank of the mississippi because of the flooding
[2:29:30.860 --> 2:29:36.060]  We've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse
[2:29:36.060 --> 2:29:41.980]  We thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory

[2:32:13.060 --> 2:32:21.060]  And they're all saying Alex it's incredible you've been obsessing on China since you got on air 20 something years ago and now it's all coming true
[2:32:21.060 --> 2:32:29.060]  How did you know it because the council on farm relations is the shadow government and they admitted the plan to transfer all power to communist China
[2:32:29.060 --> 2:32:38.060]  And almost everyone calling me says yeah and they banned you because you were saying all that and how Silicon Valley Google and Apple moved over there
[2:32:38.060 --> 2:32:47.060]  And it's incredible and wow you're vindicated you're going to get back on the air now aren't you and no if we don't defeat this takeover you're all going to be taken off
[2:32:47.060 --> 2:32:56.060]  In fact you're all going to end up getting put in prison camps they're making their move they're coming for your guns they're coming for your kids they're coming for your right to religion
[2:32:56.060 --> 2:32:58.060]  They are coming for your soul
[2:32:58.060 --> 2:33:18.060]  Well you know what they say you got to lower your ideals of freedom if you want to suck on the warm teat of China
[2:33:18.060 --> 2:33:36.060]  Ladies and gentlemen we are back live one of the videos that I'll air at the start of the next hour before Nick baggage comes on was shot in Dallas last night by Caitlin Bennett
[2:33:36.060 --> 2:33:48.060]  She talked to dozens of people and said we need to ban the full auto guns that fire cotton balls out of them and we need to stop them giving newborn babies the machine guns
[2:33:48.060 --> 2:33:57.060]  And they're like yes we need to ban that and then she goes in the invisible clips and magazines that you can't see and they're like yes we need to ban those
[2:33:57.060 --> 2:34:06.060]  They swat team everyone and take them yes we need to do that I never even got to Betua Roar yesterday I was so obsessed with the fact that they're hyping up killing Trump everywhere
[2:34:06.060 --> 2:34:15.060]  Yeah there it is invisible magazine clips liberals don't know anything about guns I mean that headline doesn't even do it justice and by the way you can't do it justice
[2:34:15.060 --> 2:34:28.060]  These people don't know their ass from a hole in the ground and that's exactly how the system wants it what are the architect of
[2:34:28.060 --> 2:34:39.060]  Obamacare said he said thank God the public so dumb and has no memory but I'm going to go to your calls here in a moment but some of the great things Trump said
[2:34:39.060 --> 2:34:50.060]  Like I said his rhetoric is as good as it gets we're fighting it's leftist socialist and globalist this is just so beautiful and it's going to have long lasting effects
[2:34:50.060 --> 2:35:00.060]  As Trump teaches America on a bigger scale than I ever could and the world who the real enemy is I mean this is big mojo
[2:35:00.060 --> 2:35:11.060]  Against leftists socialist and globalists who want to return to reckless wars open borders rampant crime and totally disastrous one way trade deals
[2:35:11.060 --> 2:35:18.060]  We're changing that one around very quickly because they're corporate raiders they want destruction they feed off the crisis
[2:35:18.060 --> 2:35:33.060]  They believe America is the world's piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy military and defense of every other nation in the world but our own it's not happening anymore
[2:35:33.060 --> 2:35:52.060]  Our political opposition made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens and you know that's what's been happening and that's why 2016 was so important and that's why 2020 I can never say it's more important
[2:35:52.060 --> 2:36:13.060]  But you know it's like the roots of a tree you plant the baby tree it's got to catch get that extra time we'll have more tax cuts we'll have even I'll tell you what we have rebuilt our military what we've done has never been done before
[2:36:13.060 --> 2:36:29.060]  That is probably the best minute I've ever heard from Trump except he did so good at the UN saying globalism is not the future nationalism and family and free market and religious freedom for Christians and is the future
[2:36:29.060 --> 2:36:39.060]  I mean it's just wonderful that's why I want Trump to win I want to win I want to beat the enemy but we would not be here right now it wasn't for the listeners
[2:36:39.060 --> 2:36:49.060]  Now I'm going to get to all the callers here supposedly everybody disagrees and thinks Trump should be impeached they had some technical problems earlier going to go to your calls but I'm going to try to go to anti deep state in a moment
[2:36:49.060 --> 2:36:58.060]  and then Gary and James and Matt and Toby and Patty and then Rob do who got four hours sleep like I did I'm just saying he's a hard working guy
[2:36:58.060 --> 2:37:09.060]  because I might knock on the rest of the guys they needed some time off you know they're all sleeping I guess he's been up here that's why he's the news director because he works 20 hours a day when you need him to and he is
[2:37:09.060 --> 2:37:19.060]  been working like a beaver with hours and five different cameras of footage to try to put together four minutes of highlights that we will air
[2:37:19.060 --> 2:37:29.060]  at the start of the next hour and then post the article that's linked on drudgerport.com Alex Jones arrives at Trump rally in armored vehicle and again the Lord works in mysterious ways
[2:37:29.060 --> 2:37:40.060]  again I was sitting here my crew was there I'm saying they're trying to assassinate the president even telegraphing they want to do it we need to point out what happened to Kennedy and Dallas and that they're openly talking about it
[2:37:40.060 --> 2:37:51.060]  and that they could happen anytime I mean they said they want to kill him and so I said you know I may go up there I was fully intending to go up there but I didn't want to give any enemy operatives exactly where I would be and win
[2:37:51.060 --> 2:38:05.060]  for obvious reasons they're literally gunning for me and we we called a group of you know retired soldiers that run a security company and the group that my security's with and they said yeah we got an armored
[2:38:05.060 --> 2:38:18.060]  Suburban and we got an armored truck and they said he might want to bullhorn out the top of the truck I don't usually want to look ostentatious and I thought hey this is a great entrance and it worked out really really nice
[2:38:18.060 --> 2:38:33.060]  I went up and down in front of it an hour before the doors before Trump even got there right during the golden hour and it is it's it's it's powerful powerful powerful stuff that is coming up and we've got a bunch of HD footage too
[2:38:33.060 --> 2:38:45.060]  so throughout the weekend that's going to be coming out like I said five cameras shooting HD it takes a lot of people to even go through that but we're not seeing it in there folks and that's why your financial support is so critical is that
[2:38:45.060 --> 2:39:07.060]  we got Millie Weaver, Caitlin Bennett and Paul Watson and Dan Lyman and so many other great reporters I'm not going to name them all here like Tom Pappard and you've got them delicious goes on and on there's a lot of people and John Bowne delicious goes on and on

[2:40:55.060 --> 2:41:09.060]  magazines in the barrel can you believe that they do anything I guess you know I didn't know what a bump stock was until Las Vegas bump stock you just stick a little piece of cotton in there and it just turns the the whole thing
[2:41:09.060 --> 2:41:24.060]  into an automatic machine gun right yes her parents just able to buy it for them like so they go in with a coupon from the NRA and they're like hey I have a coupon from the NRA for PG 13 can I get one and they just give
[2:41:24.060 --> 2:41:36.060]  them they don't even really have to pay for them they think that every kid should have a have a PG 13 okay that's that's insane I think it's great that you're talking about this I think it's a huge problem I mean invisible guns are
[2:41:36.060 --> 2:41:49.060]  definitely do better than we're doing now and the idea of invisible guns doesn't sound like we're doing better no more clips with holes in them and less clips with holes in them yeah sure

[2:48:05.060 --> 2:48:19.060]  then I'll be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Sunday live let's go ahead and talk to anti-deep state party that's the caller's name from North Dakota okay anti-deep state thanks for calling welcome
[2:48:19.060 --> 2:48:37.060]  thank you Alex appreciate the call and been a long time listener I have a love hate relationship with Donald Trump two of my things that are really get under my skin number one is the red flag laws
[2:48:37.060 --> 2:48:54.060]  that really is going to put a damper on gun owners you know I work for courtroom watch calm and we're finding a lot of mental arrest in the court systems and I believe they're going to go after American citizens with those laws
[2:48:54.060 --> 2:49:09.060]  and secondly my other gripe with him is this communist type of social score that he's trying to bring into America you know that I think is a very dangerous road to go down
[2:49:09.060 --> 2:49:24.060]  well I want to be fair we're told that's been proposed to him and we confirmed it was proposed and that he didn't decry it but I don't think it's fair to say he proposed it he did say we'll look at red flag laws and later he said no those won't work we're not going to do that so he backed down on those
[2:49:24.060 --> 2:49:30.060]  or he backed off of those well let's hope that he sticks with that really
[2:49:30.060 --> 2:49:46.060]  oh I agree listen there are he needs to go offensive we need to have the federal courts as well you've got all over the country they're taking guns from people an 86 year old cross walker or where was it it was in the main it was on Monday
[2:49:46.060 --> 2:50:01.060]  or was it in Delaware it was he the school resource officer was taken long two hour lunch breaks and he said hey some crazy to shoot up school he needs to be there and take his lunch there
[2:50:01.060 --> 2:50:19.060]  they said that was a threat they admitted that the old guy has no record and that he wasn't saying he'd shoot up the school he was saying the cop needs to be there so they took his gun red flag law that's the end of the process that a guy sent out a meme on Joker saying you know one ticket for Joker please
[2:50:19.060 --> 2:50:30.060]  as a joke showing a guy in a black trench coat well that isn't a call for violence it's saying you know incel a guy without a girl the Joker it was a joke they took his guns in Washington state pretty dangerous huh
[2:50:30.060 --> 2:50:51.060]  right absolutely and I feel like they're going to be pushing this more and more I mean it's like a repeat of history like Nazi Germany use mental health laws on the people and you know we have the advantage we we see history and as American citizens we have the ability to take action in a very civil way
[2:50:51.060 --> 2:51:09.060]  you know what you just said I mean we history is 2020 and not just hindsight that is what history is and we know what's happening is bad we know it's going to be horrible and that's what upsets me the most is to see so many fellow Americans that are just totally unaware of what's already hitting
[2:51:09.060 --> 2:51:22.060]  them but let me ask you this you're saying you're saying impeached Trump for red flag laws I don't think that's fair because he's not really doing that and again what would you get if you got rid of him
[2:51:22.060 --> 2:51:36.060]  honestly what we'd get well if we got rid of Donald Trump is we would get somebody that we know is a complete enemy somebody that would make the American people rise up and take back our country
[2:51:36.060 --> 2:51:46.060]  well that's one school of thought that they knew Hillary would blow up so they let Trump get in and knowing that would actually energize the leftist that's a very sophisticated Machiavellian view
[2:51:46.060 --> 2:51:54.060]  I appreciate your call I don't know if I agree with that but I don't think I can disagree with it because the the future is not set yet but
[2:51:54.060 --> 2:52:09.060]  man if Hillary had gotten in oh I mean whoa I just thank God for Trump I I just I just again I love Trump is doing so much good but he has the power to really get them off his back and my back and other people's backs
[2:52:09.060 --> 2:52:19.060]  and I was on a plane last night you're flying up to Dallas thanks to call anti-deep state this woman talked to me for an hour because we were stuck on the tarmac for 40 minutes and she was a liberal
[2:52:19.060 --> 2:52:26.060]  she's like oh my god your Alex Jones I've heard your Satan after about 20 minutes he goes well you're really nice I really like you blah blah blah
[2:52:26.060 --> 2:52:38.060]  and she was just flipping out with one of the satyr goes yeah but what about how his resort is going to host the G7 and that's a violation of you know him making money in a government position
[2:52:38.060 --> 2:52:50.060]  and I went are you kidding and he is the emoluments clause says he can't enrich himself from his office but that means he can't say all government businesses can only stay in my hotels
[2:52:50.060 --> 2:53:00.060]  if no one ever stays in his hotels which is happening because he's the president and it's government then he would lose that when his hotels are right there in the same area and we're used before
[2:53:00.060 --> 2:53:10.060]  and so Trump's like I'm gonna say G7 can meet there and then he won't use any US government money but that foreign countries will come pay for which is all his plan
[2:53:10.060 --> 2:53:17.060]  well that place is about to go under Trump's lost billions I mean he's dying from this and so other presidents make big money off things
[2:53:17.060 --> 2:53:26.060]  you know as long as he's not doing it from the taxpayers or whatever I don't see how he gets rid of everything he's got and he goes bankrupt because he's the president he already gives up his paycheck
[2:53:26.060 --> 2:53:35.060]  and they're always henpecking the Air Force landed you know in Scotland and then the officers decided to stay at his hotel on their own money because it was the close by
[2:53:35.060 --> 2:53:45.060]  and the media said that was an emolument violation so I kind of get what Trump's doing at a certain point like hey China that's the gate Biden you know you paid him off
[2:53:45.060 --> 2:53:54.060]  I told you that was sarcastic and now Jordan and others have said that and so is Trump he's not serious he's calling China on it
[2:53:54.060 --> 2:54:02.060]  oh you think Ukraine's bad China why don't you look at Biden and what you did he's calling them
[2:54:02.060 --> 2:54:10.060]  and so CNN's like he's normalizing his corruption no he's not letting you intimidate him into not taking action
[2:54:10.060 --> 2:54:17.060]  now he's doing it so hardcore he may be going too far
[2:54:17.060 --> 2:54:28.060]  because it's now the time to say let's have the G7 in our facility that's just asking for it but I think Trump just doesn't care anymore
[2:54:28.060 --> 2:54:40.060]  which is called real confidence I mean there's no confidence on earth like I'm not going to tell the whole story I'll just go to your calls but people know when you're really confident versus when you're not confident
[2:54:40.060 --> 2:54:52.060]  fake confidence is not the real deal people smell real confidence like if you go in a room of women and you're not trying to attract them or be around them or impress them and you're busy
[2:54:52.060 --> 2:54:58.060]  you're the guy they can't stop talking to her looking at her wanting it's the same thing in anything
[2:54:58.060 --> 2:55:07.060]  you know it's like if you're at a ball event or something and there's a repair guy fixing you know a chandelier in the corner
[2:55:07.060 --> 2:55:13.060]  the women are all looking at him because he's focused and not thinking about them it's just the way the universe works I don't know how to explain it
[2:55:13.060 --> 2:55:21.060]  but it's the same thing like Trump at some point has to stop caring what the globalists think or do and stop reacting to everything like he's done something wrong
[2:55:21.060 --> 2:55:31.060]  the danger is he doesn't want to go too far but my god all these presidents personally have these foundations and get hundreds of millions and billions
[2:55:31.060 --> 2:55:41.060]  and just to do paper play publicly and Biden goes on TV and says yeah I had the guy fired because he talked about you know investigating my son I held back a billion dollars if they didn't
[2:55:41.060 --> 2:55:53.060]  I mean he's doing it out in the open so Trump's saying well we used to have all these big things at my places before this and they said they want to have it here and you know at a certain point
[2:55:53.060 --> 2:56:01.060]  but that's like it's starting to I don't know man it's crazy I'm sure Trump knows what he's doing we're going to find out
[2:56:01.060 --> 2:56:05.060]  okay Gary in Florida Gary thanks for holding you're on the air welcome
[2:56:05.060 --> 2:56:09.060]  Alex can you hear me I sure can sir
[2:56:09.060 --> 2:56:14.060]  okay you rock man I really enjoyed listening to you rock brother what's on your mind
[2:56:14.060 --> 2:56:24.060]  well what's on my mind is impeachment at this point may be not so bad to expose
[2:56:24.060 --> 2:56:30.060]  what's going on in my opinion I think you know I don't know what's in Trump's mind
[2:56:30.060 --> 2:56:40.060]  but each day we learn something new and my feeling is you got this scour moochie guy going around saying 20 30 senators have turned already
[2:56:40.060 --> 2:56:50.060]  you've got generals coming out saying that this guy should never make it to an election against article 88
[2:56:50.060 --> 2:56:54.060]  oh I don't think there's any doubt they're making their move on Trump
[2:56:54.060 --> 2:57:05.060]  yeah so you've got all these people in intelligence agencies never in 58 years if I see anything like this going on CNN and everywhere else
[2:57:05.060 --> 2:57:12.060]  but I think that's a good thing this is the permanent deep state that presided over to sell out of our nation just like he said earlier
[2:57:12.060 --> 2:57:16.060]  he said these people have gotten rich off selling out our nation that's what globalism is
[2:57:16.060 --> 2:57:23.060]  absolutely absolutely so we're talking trillions these people have taken trillions
[2:57:23.060 --> 2:57:29.060]  used Ukraine in all these places as bases and have taken trillions of dollars
[2:57:29.060 --> 2:57:35.060]  so you guys guys these multi-course multinational corporations like you guys like source
[2:57:35.060 --> 2:57:40.060]  hold on so Gary you don't think you should be impeached you think Trump's setting them up
[2:57:40.060 --> 2:57:42.060]  exactly I think impeached
[2:57:42.060 --> 2:57:47.060]  hold on hold on stay there stay there we're ain't to Gary we're getting to James, Patty, Toby and Matt

[3:00:43.060 --> 3:00:52.060]  we're now into the fourth hour we're taking your phone calls right now and Gary who I really appreciate holding is saying impeachment should happen
[3:00:52.060 --> 3:01:01.060]  Trump is setting up fall guys well yeah the trial in the house is already happening you're not supposed to have a trial in the house
[3:01:01.060 --> 3:01:08.060]  you're supposed to have an inquiry so they're having a secret trial to claim they have evidence but then they're going to want to try to have the vote
[3:01:08.060 --> 3:01:16.060]  that supposedly convicts him and then have the trial in the Senate they were all done by this year and Gary thinks somehow that's going to blow up in their face
[3:01:16.060 --> 3:01:24.060]  is that where you're going with this Gary well yeah I don't this thing is I don't think it's going to get there I mean basically a deep state is telling us
[3:01:24.060 --> 3:01:33.060]  it's not going to get there you have generals now almost like a military coup coming out and saying this guy is never going to get there we need to do this now
[3:01:33.060 --> 3:01:47.060]  and they're not talking about impeachment either so whether they who knows what they have up their sleeve all I know is if we just say is he going to be able to get now his infrastructure through
[3:01:47.060 --> 3:02:04.060]  never not the way things are now it's not going to happen so he can you know and we need this so the setting this setting on him up for the economy to totally crash so they're not going to let him get to that point so something is going to happen he sees it
[3:02:04.060 --> 3:02:20.060]  so all of a sudden if you notice he's changed so much in the last 30 days he's got a lot more hardcore he's letting it fly he's let he's exposing people Larry Cudlow his economic guy came out today and said you got to do the deal with China
[3:02:20.060 --> 3:02:34.060]  I'm talking to CMBC you got to do the deal with China you got to do it all you got to do it all the economy needs again yeah just just sell out so you know the thing is he's he's surrounded by people they're not going to let him get infrastructure done
[3:02:34.060 --> 3:02:48.060]  they're not going to let him get a Canada and Mexico trade so we're they're busy trying to sabotage the economy as fast as they can yeah so we're at a point now that so he's got to be saying whoa I you know heads I wouldn't tell
[3:02:48.060 --> 3:03:00.060]  I mean in other words we're in a place where impeachment would actually be something where if they the senators was so no I get it you're saying at least that'll show them trying to persecute him and they don't have anything
[3:03:00.060 --> 3:03:15.060]  instead of them killing him or drugging him 22nd amendment saying he's incapacitated having his cabinet turn against him they're trying to create that stampede feeling that actually gets that done but he's so charismatic the real poll show he's more popular than ever
[3:03:15.060 --> 3:03:31.060]  I don't know how they're going to get that pulled off that's what I'm saying this is an explosive moment like a hydrogen bomb he's got the fall guys now see in other words if this goes down he can say look the economy would have been great if they let me do this for you
[3:03:31.060 --> 3:03:48.060]  let me do so when he goes to these terrific rallies it's like being in the arena he's like our wwe gladiator I love America people are hanging from the rafters we want to disguise we want to win and all the guys that are in a D state that are getting
[3:03:48.060 --> 3:04:07.060]  multi-billion dollar contracts left and right spreading money and doing things I mean he really came in and tried to change it but now he's at the point where at least he can show the contrast and say look what I wanted to do look at the economy crash so because they did this
[3:04:07.060 --> 3:04:24.060]  so now he wins he wins and so we can see it we can have an illustration in front of us sort of like you you know a raptor will go and test the fence test the fence test the fence test the fence and then we need some kind of Godzilla to come in
[3:04:24.060 --> 3:04:34.060]  but he has really done so much and he's exposing now what do you see your smart guy we're almost out of time in this segment Gary what do you think should happen
[3:04:34.060 --> 3:04:53.060]  well I think Trump basically knows what's going to happen I can't see him resigning and doing some kind of deal although he's losing business I can't imagine the rest of the family is through so I don't know if he can get it
[3:04:53.060 --> 3:05:06.060]  doing a patient trial these senators you just said it's an epic moment the globalist are damned are they removing they're damned that they don't I mean this is just unbelievable I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from
[3:05:06.060 --> 3:05:24.060]  your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the US worldwide and President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well
[3:05:24.060 --> 3:05:37.060]  he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist China Trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever
[3:05:37.060 --> 3:05:56.060]  we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalist are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us
[3:05:56.060 --> 3:06:10.060]  that's an attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy
[3:06:10.060 --> 3:06:35.060]  you keep saying you've got something for me but confess something you call love but confess you've been a messin you know I sit back and I look at how epic the times are everybody over uses epic but they're epic
[3:06:35.060 --> 3:06:52.060]  and I look at the screws they put to me trying to get me to turn against Trump I can't imagine what it's like for senators for everybody else in the media so listeners have to remember that that's going on I mean major pressure is being brought to bear
[3:06:52.060 --> 3:07:14.060]  I mean why do you think Tucker Carlson got invited to dinner with old Zuckerberg and then Zookie was on Fox the next day there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes a lot of threats a lot of serious stuff I mean it's big big time twisting of arms happening
[3:07:14.060 --> 3:07:29.060]  let's just pray for justice pray for discernment and just keep doing our job promoting Americana and basic freedom and if we defend our values and don't buckle to those that want us to follow their orders that are unconstitutional and garbage
[3:07:29.060 --> 3:07:37.060]  we're going to be able to make it through this but it's about integrity right now folks and we stand on the shoulders of people that have a lot of integrity before us
[3:07:37.060 --> 3:07:50.060]  America's had a lot of wild things in our history we were known for integrity and known for doing what we said we do compared to others and we're we're we're rediscovering that right now together
[3:07:50.060 --> 3:08:00.060]  we're finding it just how bad we can get we're finding just how good we can get James and Louisiana I got to move quick now thanks for holding James and we'll go to Patty and Toby go ahead and Matt go ahead James
[3:08:00.060 --> 3:08:18.060]  yeah hey Alex so I guess I got two points on it because on a personal like a selfish level I do want them to get impeached I think mainly because it's going to cause so many of the people that have been on autopilot ignoring everything they'll kind of have to put their heads up and see what the hell is going on
[3:08:18.060 --> 3:08:36.060]  yeah I think that's why Drudge has been you know showing how much trouble Trump's in because he is in trouble they're coming after him they got all these generals everybody's all over TV saying get him kill him and then you know Trump's saying everything's fine which I get he has to add confident somebody's got to be there to say no we're not in a perfect position
[3:08:36.060 --> 3:08:51.060]  yes sir I mean I mean on a basic level obviously I don't want him to get impeached because he's he's doing the closest thing to what we need is a country compared to anybody else that's on that platform but I feel like right now the uprising needs to happen in our country
[3:08:51.060 --> 3:09:06.060]  and I'm wanting to see more individuals make movements to show that we can change politics and listen I got a bunch of enemies and I'm not bragging saying I'm Mr tough guy I have a lot of courage it's just what has to be done and I have no fear
[3:09:06.060 --> 3:09:19.060]  but you know they're the anti-fun folks want to kill me I went up to Dallas I went into the crowd I did it all for a couple hours just to show that that's what has to happen everybody's got to put their skin in the game we're going to lose it all
[3:09:19.060 --> 3:09:32.060]  yes sir I absolutely agree I think right now the two big messages need to be full transparency of our government if he can push something like that where we can all watch what the government is doing as far as the technology that we have in 2020
[3:09:32.060 --> 3:09:44.060]  it's crazy to me that the people of our country can't even see what's going on behind these closed doors that are going to affect every American and I also want to get rid of all the censorship on the social media platform
[3:09:44.060 --> 3:09:51.060]  if they say they're a platform they shouldn't be banning people like you or anybody that speaks out against what kind of message they're promoting
[3:09:51.060 --> 3:09:55.060]  it is false advertising a billion percent James you're absolutely right
[3:09:55.060 --> 3:10:04.060]  the censorship is crazy right now and I think if Trump made them decide are you a publisher or a platform that would change a lot of the things
[3:10:04.060 --> 3:10:18.060]  and so like I said a lot of criticism of Trump in his new NAFTA get renegotiation he gives unbelievable immunity to big tech even worse than it was that was actually in Reuters yesterday you don't normally see truth out of Reuters
[3:10:18.060 --> 3:10:30.060]  but it was like Republicans and Democrats mad at Trump that he's giving total immunity to big tech again I don't think Trump knows what's in the full agreement that's why it's good that's in the news God bless you
[3:10:30.060 --> 3:10:38.060]  and that's another thing that could you know make people really mad I mean it makes me mad okay but I've learned Trump's overwhelmed
[3:10:38.060 --> 3:10:43.060]  I mean I don't know what's going on right now two offices over for me and I only have a hundred and something crew members
[3:10:43.060 --> 3:10:48.060]  I'm not giving Trump a pass let's let him know what's going on
[3:10:48.060 --> 3:10:54.060]  they told Trump red flag laws were just if somebody's been adjudicated mentally ill and violent they don't get gone he's like yeah I have their medical records
[3:10:54.060 --> 3:11:02.060]  then he goes wait no due process just take people's guns we're not doing that they lied to him
[3:11:02.060 --> 3:11:08.060]  thank you James great points okay Patty and Tejas you're on the air thanks for holding
[3:11:08.060 --> 3:11:12.060]  hey Alex hey Patty thanks for holding welcome
[3:11:12.060 --> 3:11:18.060]  thanks for taking my call you guys just rock I love your show and I listen to it every day so
[3:11:18.060 --> 3:11:23.060]  well thank you man please spread the word about it shall we stay on the air and defeat the globalist
[3:11:23.060 --> 3:11:28.060]  you're doing a great service for everybody in the United States even the ones you don't understand what you're doing
[3:11:28.060 --> 3:11:31.060]  so keep keep keep on I'm trying
[3:11:31.060 --> 3:11:37.060]  um Alex I was calling in about Syria and I um with
[3:11:37.060 --> 3:11:42.060]  Trump dealing with um a peace talks in Syria
[3:11:42.060 --> 3:11:49.060]  he's um he's made some incredible huge enemies by the past that he's going down
[3:11:49.060 --> 3:11:57.060]  um um the uh he's pissed off the the intelligence community he's pissed off the
[3:11:57.060 --> 3:12:03.060]  the military industrial complex he's pissed off the bankers he's pissed off everybody
[3:12:03.060 --> 3:12:09.060]  um that you can possibly piss off by the drawing troops and and um
[3:12:09.060 --> 3:12:16.060]  striking a peace deal the the reason that we were in Syria in the first place is
[3:12:16.060 --> 3:12:20.060]  is never been told or it's not been um
[3:12:20.060 --> 3:12:26.060]  stressed to the people of the United States and I think that has a lot to do with why
[3:12:26.060 --> 3:12:30.060]  Trump is going to be in a lot of trouble with um the powers that be in the globalist
[3:12:30.060 --> 3:12:34.060]  are you saying it's about those gas pipelines
[3:12:34.060 --> 3:12:40.060]  well the gas pipelines are only a part of it but that's kind of like um
[3:12:40.060 --> 3:12:46.060]  uh that's kind of like it's not small fry but it is in comparison to the reason that they wanted to get rid of
[3:12:46.060 --> 3:12:50.060]  sure so tell us tell us I mean we know the powers that be that we're sick of
[3:12:50.060 --> 3:12:54.060]  that hate us that sold us out hate Trump and really want to kill him which means he's good
[3:12:54.060 --> 3:12:58.060]  uh and I but but but specifically then why are you saying we were in Syria
[3:12:58.060 --> 3:13:02.060]  we're in Syria because um it's one of the few last few
[3:13:02.060 --> 3:13:08.060]  countries that don't have um uh central bank put in through the world bank
[3:13:08.060 --> 3:13:12.060]  and IMF oh there's no doubt that Syria
[3:13:12.060 --> 3:13:16.060]  isn't under the new world order and neither is Iran and so uh
[3:13:16.060 --> 3:13:22.060]  exactly it's not in the global government system right and that's that's the main reason why oh yeah
[3:13:22.060 --> 3:13:26.060]  Trump is saying no to world government right Trump saying China is not going to tell us
[3:13:26.060 --> 3:13:32.060]  what to do and we're not going to be over here for the big banks controlling Syria exactly no that's it yes
[3:13:32.060 --> 3:13:38.060]  yeah Assad had Assad uh was not going to go along with that at all and that's that's why that's why they
[3:13:38.060 --> 3:13:44.060]  want to resume change up there and the same thing happened to Muammar Gaddafi right
[3:13:44.060 --> 3:13:52.060]  and yeah Gaddafi uh he wanted his uh he was setting up a gold standard for his own
[3:13:52.060 --> 3:13:58.060]  monetary he was setting up an average union right and the whole thing and and and he was not on a
[3:13:58.060 --> 3:14:04.060]  central bank so that he was setting up a interest-free system that would have empowered Africa and that was a big no-no
[3:14:04.060 --> 3:14:10.060]  yeah absolutely the last one of the very last countries that doesn't have a central bank
[3:14:10.060 --> 3:14:16.060]  Alex that you probably already know is Russia so that's one of the reasons I think that the
[3:14:16.060 --> 3:14:24.060]  Clintons and um the other people you know that support killery um has been targeting Russia
[3:14:24.060 --> 3:14:30.060]  and kind of a backhanded sort of way that she's done it Patty you're absolutely right and and Trump's
[3:14:30.060 --> 3:14:34.060]  saying it's wrong that we try to run other countries and it's wrong they run us he's really a nationalist
[3:14:34.060 --> 3:14:40.060]  and he's up turning the entire global government model nationalism americanism not globalism and
[3:14:40.060 --> 3:14:44.060]  that's why they're coming after him and why they're threatening everybody else that supports him god bless
[3:14:44.060 --> 3:14:48.060]  you amazing point we have a lot of great callers today that was the best call of the show we got

[3:20:06.060 --> 3:20:32.060]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:20:32.060 --> 3:20:54.060]  this is what families
[3:20:54.060 --> 3:21:09.060]  have to go through just to come here
[3:21:09.060 --> 3:21:29.060]  ladies and gentlemen
[3:21:29.060 --> 3:21:39.060]  we are here to emphasize on the first of this month in defiance on the training
[3:21:39.060 --> 3:21:49.060]  we are here in America to stand up to these moms of criminal and drugs
[3:21:49.060 --> 3:22:07.060]  all these free goodies are going to get on the wreckage of America
[3:22:07.060 --> 3:22:23.060]  literally
[3:22:23.060 --> 3:22:34.060]  you saw that you've been a police officer even the army the Marines you've
[3:22:34.060 --> 3:22:38.060]  been in the black water everything and we saw it yourself the Dallas PD stood down
[3:22:38.060 --> 3:22:42.060]  and let them swarm us I'd have to say that I hate to say that I'm very pro police
[3:22:42.060 --> 3:22:47.060]  but in this instance right here there was at least eight Dallas police officers
[3:22:47.060 --> 3:22:51.060]  right there and they all backed away and let Antifa swarm us which is totally
[3:22:51.060 --> 3:22:54.060]  unacceptable they saw that the situation was getting out of hand and it didn't
[3:22:54.060 --> 3:23:15.060]  step in
[3:23:15.060 --> 3:23:30.060]  life
[3:23:30.060 --> 3:23:32.060]  Yes!
[3:23:32.060 --> 3:23:34.060]  America is a war.
[3:23:34.060 --> 3:23:35.060]  Yes!
[3:23:35.060 --> 3:23:41.060]  And the state is not ruined for sassing our president, Washington J.F.P.,
[3:23:41.060 --> 3:24:08.060]  36 years ago, here in Dallas.
[3:24:08.060 --> 3:24:12.060]  And welcome back to Infowars, and this is Dr. Nick Begich,
[3:24:12.060 --> 3:24:17.060]  and I'm in Anchorage, Alaska today, and I'm missing everyone last week,
[3:24:17.060 --> 3:24:19.060]  but I'm glad to be back.
[3:24:19.060 --> 3:24:24.060]  You know, picking up kind of where the program sort of left off,
[3:24:24.060 --> 3:24:28.060]  you know, talking about, you know, what's really going on.
[3:24:28.060 --> 3:24:32.060]  What's the background noise that we should be paying attention to
[3:24:32.060 --> 3:24:36.060]  that we kind of get ignoring as life goes on, you know?
[3:24:36.060 --> 3:24:40.060]  And I've read a lot this last couple of weeks.
[3:24:40.060 --> 3:24:47.060]  You know, I read Snowden's new book, this one, Permanent Record.
[3:24:47.060 --> 3:24:50.060]  Pretty interesting, a few things I kind of wonder about,
[3:24:50.060 --> 3:24:53.060]  but Alex, I think, mentioned those a few weeks back.
[3:24:53.060 --> 3:24:56.060]  But having read it, I got to say, you know,
[3:24:56.060 --> 3:25:00.060]  it would be sure nice to see him protecting privacy in America,
[3:25:00.060 --> 3:25:05.060]  maybe running the government accounting office after a presidential pardon.
[3:25:05.060 --> 3:25:09.060]  Snowden, boy, if you haven't read his book, somebody ought to read it
[3:25:09.060 --> 3:25:12.060]  and summarize it again for the president.
[3:25:12.060 --> 3:25:14.060]  This guy deserves a pardon.
[3:25:14.060 --> 3:25:18.060]  Snowden, Mr. President, pardon him.
[3:25:18.060 --> 3:25:23.060]  And let him tell us how to protect our privacy rather than see it exploited.
[3:25:23.060 --> 3:25:26.060]  And having read it, you know, it confirms what I've been saying
[3:25:26.060 --> 3:25:32.060]  for over 20 years that every single electronic communication that we do,
[3:25:32.060 --> 3:25:35.060]  no matter where it goes, is recorded, Captain.
[3:25:35.060 --> 3:25:40.060]  Eventually, of course, we know you don't have anything to hide.
[3:25:40.060 --> 3:25:43.060]  You know, this is, I was thinking about this,
[3:25:43.060 --> 3:25:45.060]  and I read some things about this.
[3:25:45.060 --> 3:25:48.060]  Now, people always say that when you get into the issue of proxy.
[3:25:48.060 --> 3:25:50.060]  Oh, I don't have anything to hide, don't worry.
[3:25:50.060 --> 3:25:53.060]  So if you don't have anything to say, you don't care about freedom of speech.
[3:25:53.060 --> 3:25:56.060]  And if you don't read the newspaper, you don't care about freedom of the press.
[3:25:56.060 --> 3:25:58.060]  And I guess if you don't have any friends,
[3:25:58.060 --> 3:26:00.060]  you don't care about the freedom of assembly.
[3:26:00.060 --> 3:26:03.060]  And if you don't believe in God, maybe you don't care about religion either.
[3:26:03.060 --> 3:26:09.060]  But actually we ought to care about privacy because the door has been kicked into
[3:26:09.060 --> 3:26:15.060]  your digital doorway and you're standing naked before God and the government.
[3:26:15.060 --> 3:26:17.060]  Isn't that funny?
[3:26:17.060 --> 3:26:22.060]  G-O-D and G-O-V, you're naked.
[3:26:22.060 --> 3:26:27.060]  But having said that, I've also read another book this summer.
[3:26:27.060 --> 3:26:31.060]  This one I highly recommend, this one.
[3:26:31.060 --> 3:26:37.060]  Poisoner in Chief, the Sydney Gottlieb and the CIA Search for Mind Control.
[3:26:37.060 --> 3:26:42.060]  This is a new one, you know, this is 2019 also.
[3:26:42.060 --> 3:26:46.060]  And you know, what's interesting about it is I, for 25 years, 30 years,
[3:26:46.060 --> 3:26:51.060]  I've been researching Gottlieb and the mind control programs of the CIA.
[3:26:51.060 --> 3:26:57.060]  You know, when you kind of read the narrative on this,
[3:26:57.060 --> 3:27:00.060]  I really don't want to say on the radio guy.
[3:27:00.060 --> 3:27:03.060]  Anyway, Gottlieb, when you read it, you go,
[3:27:03.060 --> 3:27:09.060]  man, you know, this guy should have been buried under the prison, you know.
[3:27:09.060 --> 3:27:12.060]  And Snowden has to hide out.
[3:27:12.060 --> 3:27:17.060]  You know, he was headed to Ecuador to be safe and they took his State Department
[3:27:17.060 --> 3:27:21.060]  and skated his papers and he couldn't make it.
[3:27:21.060 --> 3:27:25.060]  Man, having read his story in his own words, I recommend.
[3:27:25.060 --> 3:27:30.060]  Because it'll move you a little bit to know what this guy gave up for a measure of,
[3:27:30.060 --> 3:27:36.060]  maybe a measure of light on our personal privacy and the hijacking of it.
[3:27:36.060 --> 3:27:40.060]  What used to be a conspiracy theory, thank you.
[3:27:40.060 --> 3:27:46.060]  Thank you, Mr. Snowden, for making a theory of facts so all of us can know the truth a little bit of it anyway.
[3:27:46.060 --> 3:27:50.060]  And it would have been nice to know the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
[3:27:50.060 --> 3:27:54.060]  So help us, God, but no, we don't get that in our country anymore.
[3:27:54.060 --> 3:27:57.060]  We just get to swear that on our way to the jury trial.
[3:27:57.060 --> 3:28:00.060]  Man, so those were good ones.
[3:28:00.060 --> 3:28:05.060]  And then the other one I read, I know this guy has said some nasty things about Alex,
[3:28:05.060 --> 3:28:08.060]  but I don't think he knows Alex if he did, he wouldn't say these things.
[3:28:08.060 --> 3:28:11.060]  But Jordan Peterson, 12 rules for life.
[3:28:11.060 --> 3:28:18.060]  And Jordan, you know, I mean, he got his butt kicked and I saw about 40 hours of his videos and read his book this summer.
[3:28:18.060 --> 3:28:26.060]  And what I'd say about the guy is right on for a lot of truth in the face of opposition.
[3:28:26.060 --> 3:28:30.060]  But what I would also say to Mr. Peterson is another point.
[3:28:30.060 --> 3:28:34.060]  Don't feel like you ought to defend your dissertation.
[3:28:34.060 --> 3:28:38.060]  You already did that. Just be fearless in your work and don't be on the defense.
[3:28:38.060 --> 3:28:41.060]  Because that's the name of the game, you see.
[3:28:41.060 --> 3:28:47.060]  Truth isn't something to be defended as something to be spoken, shared, articulated and lived.
[3:28:47.060 --> 3:28:51.060]  Lived, the key element of that, you know, do it if you believe in it.
[3:28:51.060 --> 3:28:55.060]  If you're divinity, you believe in divinity that act like it will be right back.
[3:28:55.060 --> 3:29:09.060]  This is Dr. Nick Vegas this Friday afternoon.
[3:29:26.060 --> 3:29:29.060]  Oh, that is the biggie.

[3:32:31.060 --> 3:32:36.060]  So you can say the communist Chinese that David Rockefeller put in power are better than everybody.
[3:32:36.060 --> 3:32:39.060]  That is a sick, freakish joke.
[3:32:39.060 --> 3:32:43.060]  And I will not stand by and watch humanity turn over to these people.
[3:32:43.060 --> 3:32:50.060]  And I beg God for the strength and the will to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat.
[3:32:50.060 --> 3:32:55.060]  And I've been saying that prayer for 20-plus years and God is delivering because God is great.
[3:32:55.060 --> 3:32:57.060]  Thank God for his son, Jesus Christ.
[3:32:57.060 --> 3:33:02.060]  And now let's move forward against the NW.
[3:33:27.060 --> 3:33:29.060]  Nick Begich.
[3:33:29.060 --> 3:33:33.060]  You're listening to the A Welcome Back.
[3:33:33.060 --> 3:33:34.060]  Good to be here.
[3:33:34.060 --> 3:33:35.060]  Good afternoon.
[3:33:35.060 --> 3:33:42.060]  This is Dr. Nick Begich here in the pursuit of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[3:33:42.060 --> 3:33:46.060]  You know, we always forget about those three fundamentals, you know?
[3:33:46.060 --> 3:33:51.060]  In the scattering of a busy week and closing it out, you know, in many parts of the country,
[3:33:51.060 --> 3:33:56.060]  even now as we are going into these hours and around the world where this broadcast is heard.
[3:33:56.060 --> 3:34:01.060]  You know, I'm thinking about some of the things in the news, you know,
[3:34:01.060 --> 3:34:07.060]  and I mentioned some of my reading material and I recommend that for anyone interested in those themes.
[3:34:07.060 --> 3:34:12.060]  But this show is about information, about info wars.
[3:34:12.060 --> 3:34:15.060]  And that's something, you know, people say, you know, what do you do?
[3:34:15.060 --> 3:34:16.060]  What do you do, you know?
[3:34:16.060 --> 3:34:19.060]  And when you ask, you know, that's kind of a common thing besides, hey, who are you?
[3:34:19.060 --> 3:34:20.060]  What do you do?
[3:34:20.060 --> 3:34:22.060]  I read a lot, you know?
[3:34:22.060 --> 3:34:27.060]  I go in probably six, seven hours a day anyway.
[3:34:27.060 --> 3:34:34.060]  And instead of watching the television, you know, the programming, because I'm not so interested,
[3:34:34.060 --> 3:34:35.060]  I kind of select.
[3:34:35.060 --> 3:34:40.060]  So I actually read and I recommended highly, you know, these things, these things, you know,
[3:34:40.060 --> 3:34:46.060]  first generation information war is called books.
[3:34:46.060 --> 3:34:50.060]  And really, I encourage it.
[3:34:50.060 --> 3:34:52.060]  But here's what we do at info wars.
[3:34:52.060 --> 3:34:56.060]  We all take in a lot of data and then we distill it and we make it available.
[3:34:56.060 --> 3:34:58.060]  And then we cite it so you can look it up yourself.
[3:34:58.060 --> 3:34:59.060]  Isn't that great?
[3:34:59.060 --> 3:35:01.060]  I mean, that makes it easy on everybody.
[3:35:01.060 --> 3:35:02.060]  And I love doing it.
[3:35:02.060 --> 3:35:05.060]  And then we get to talk about that in the context of values.
[3:35:05.060 --> 3:35:08.060]  Somebody asked me the other day, Dr.
[3:35:08.060 --> 3:35:14.060]  Begich in this panic voice, you know, after articulating 50 of the horror stories of the 21st century,
[3:35:14.060 --> 3:35:18.060]  you know, from A to Z, from soup to nuts.
[3:35:18.060 --> 3:35:22.060]  And I said, you know, and they were waiting.
[3:35:22.060 --> 3:35:26.060]  They were waiting for that moment when it would be this thing, you know, this one technology
[3:35:26.060 --> 3:35:31.060]  or that technology or the big brother thing or whatever it was with the bankers or some
[3:35:31.060 --> 3:35:32.060]  something.
[3:35:32.060 --> 3:35:37.060]  And what it was, as I said, well, these are all the symptoms and it's about people behaving
[3:35:37.060 --> 3:35:38.060]  badly.
[3:35:38.060 --> 3:35:42.060]  You know, and that's really what it always boils down to.
[3:35:42.060 --> 3:35:46.060]  We think it's such a big deal, whether it's your five year old behaving badly or your
[3:35:46.060 --> 3:35:49.060]  president or your dictator across the globe.
[3:35:49.060 --> 3:35:54.060]  You know, whoever it is, behaving badly, it always boils down to that, doesn't it?
[3:35:54.060 --> 3:35:56.060]  Or at least in a way that we disagree with.
[3:35:56.060 --> 3:35:58.060]  And I guess we call that bad.
[3:35:58.060 --> 3:35:59.060]  But maybe it's not.
[3:35:59.060 --> 3:36:02.060]  We've got the guy that's good.
[3:36:02.060 --> 3:36:05.060]  But I would say to God, it's probably all small stuff.
[3:36:05.060 --> 3:36:06.060]  But this is important.
[3:36:06.060 --> 3:36:12.060]  You know, people say, you know, if you don't, you know, anything to hide, what do you worry
[3:36:12.060 --> 3:36:13.060]  about?
[3:36:13.060 --> 3:36:14.060]  You know, that's scary thought.
[3:36:14.060 --> 3:36:19.060]  And you could also say if you have nothing to say, and I guess I'm care about freedom
[3:36:19.060 --> 3:36:20.060]  and speech.
[3:36:20.060 --> 3:36:24.060]  But here's the point I'd really like to make.
[3:36:24.060 --> 3:36:29.060]  When you think about the press in the 21st century and what this network represents and
[3:36:29.060 --> 3:36:35.060]  why it needs to be supported and supported and why the rules need to protect the platform
[3:36:35.060 --> 3:36:41.060]  of speech, which in the 21st century is, in fact, the Internet, no one should be allowed
[3:36:41.060 --> 3:36:47.060]  to manipulate the data, no one should own or control the data, but you and me individually.
[3:36:47.060 --> 3:36:54.060]  And in Europe, why that argument even began and is going on is because some of the stuff
[3:36:54.060 --> 3:37:01.060]  that we did around 1999, 1998, 2000, we were able to get in front of planners in Europe
[3:37:01.060 --> 3:37:03.060]  to look at the privacy question in a different way.
[3:37:03.060 --> 3:37:09.060]  In fact, you can look at Earth pulse work and the work that myself and the late James
[3:37:09.060 --> 3:37:14.060]  Burke and others contributed to, that we got a lot of material in front of people that
[3:37:14.060 --> 3:37:18.060]  were setting up the regulations for privacy in Europe time and it slandered it a little
[3:37:18.060 --> 3:37:19.060]  different way.
[3:37:19.060 --> 3:37:24.060]  And why, and I mentioned it before in other segments, you know, why is the deep state
[3:37:24.060 --> 3:37:25.060]  so angry at Donald Trump?
[3:37:25.060 --> 3:37:29.060]  Well, he went after international profits for US based companies.
[3:37:29.060 --> 3:37:35.060]  So they get our military to defend their sorry butts all over the world and then they don't
[3:37:35.060 --> 3:37:36.060]  pay any taxes.
[3:37:36.060 --> 3:37:41.060]  But he does tax global income on multinational companies operating outside the United States.
[3:37:41.060 --> 3:37:46.060]  It's the same way that, you know, after all fairness, you know, that's what you as a human
[3:37:46.060 --> 3:37:52.060]  being and individualist tax on your worldwide income, no matter where you reside as an American.
[3:37:52.060 --> 3:37:59.060]  So why shouldn't American companies that are cover whose asses were covering pay for a little
[3:37:59.060 --> 3:38:02.060]  bit of the coverage, so to speak?
[3:38:02.060 --> 3:38:07.060]  You know, I mean, you know, pay the bill, you know, enjoy the defense.
[3:38:07.060 --> 3:38:12.060]  And right now in Syria, in the Middle East, everybody's going, oh, it's horrible.
[3:38:12.060 --> 3:38:16.060]  It's terrible because we're leaving.
[3:38:16.060 --> 3:38:18.060]  Why were we there?
[3:38:18.060 --> 3:38:20.060]  Why are we there?
[3:38:20.060 --> 3:38:22.060]  Should we be there?
[3:38:22.060 --> 3:38:26.060]  Gee, should we be in deading our great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,
[3:38:26.060 --> 3:38:31.060]  great, great, running out of time grandchildren to the dead of that fiasco?
[3:38:31.060 --> 3:38:33.060]  Is it our war to fight?
[3:38:33.060 --> 3:38:34.060]  Is the Kurds' war to fight?
[3:38:34.060 --> 3:38:35.060]  I absolutely agree.
[3:38:35.060 --> 3:38:36.060]  We've armed them all up.
[3:38:36.060 --> 3:38:38.060]  We've sold a lot of military arms.
[3:38:38.060 --> 3:38:43.060]  And now the armament sellers are pissed because we're leaving and we're not going to continue
[3:38:43.060 --> 3:38:47.060]  to roll up the debt and pay the bill so they can all kill each other.
[3:38:47.060 --> 3:38:50.060]  You know, we're letting Russia and Syria do whatever they're doing.
[3:38:50.060 --> 3:38:51.060]  No.
[3:38:51.060 --> 3:38:53.060]  And wow, what a mess.
[3:38:53.060 --> 3:38:59.060]  You know, it sounds like Gog and May Gog and the armies gathering at the Euphrates, which
[3:38:59.060 --> 3:39:01.060]  gee, isn't that what's happening?
[3:39:01.060 --> 3:39:04.060]  I think it is, actually.
[3:39:04.060 --> 3:39:07.060]  But should we be there?
[3:39:07.060 --> 3:39:09.060]  Should we be doing this?
[3:39:09.060 --> 3:39:11.060]  Should we be engaged in it?
[3:39:11.060 --> 3:39:13.060]  And for what purpose are we there?
[3:39:13.060 --> 3:39:15.060]  And I think those are questions worth asking.
[3:39:15.060 --> 3:39:18.060]  And is this the nature of America?
[3:39:18.060 --> 3:39:20.060]  You know, I don't think so.
[3:39:20.060 --> 3:39:24.060]  And on another point that came up in the last segment, I looked into it very carefully,
[3:39:24.060 --> 3:39:31.060]  when Alex was talking about this gun confiscation of automatic weapons, AKs, and, you know,
[3:39:31.060 --> 3:39:34.060]  ARs and all this, you know, hey, give me a break.
[3:39:34.060 --> 3:39:39.060]  The war wouldn't have been won, you know, the one 250 years ago, more or less.
[3:39:39.060 --> 3:39:44.060]  The war wouldn't have been won without the privateers who happened to own cannons and
[3:39:44.060 --> 3:39:45.060]  mortars.
[3:39:45.060 --> 3:39:50.060]  Cannons, ladies and gentlemen, if it wasn't for private ownership of cannons, we wouldn't
[3:39:50.060 --> 3:39:55.060]  be having the conversation we're having today right now on the air.
[3:39:55.060 --> 3:40:00.060]  Private ownership of cannons, not that I support that necessarily in the 21st century.
[3:40:00.060 --> 3:40:05.060]  But the point of the matter is they were the biggest weapon of the day.
[3:40:05.060 --> 3:40:11.060]  And every plantation owner and everybody owned a ship bigger than a rowboat owned one.
[3:40:11.060 --> 3:40:14.060]  And, you know, and that's kind of how it worked.
[3:40:14.060 --> 3:40:19.060]  And if it wasn't for, you know, the privateers protecting our shores and our ports, we would
[3:40:19.060 --> 3:40:23.060]  have been even in deeper trouble than that was because they owned cannons.
[3:40:23.060 --> 3:40:29.060]  And so when they talked about, oh, it was never meant to be, well, wait a minute, you
[3:40:29.060 --> 3:40:31.060]  know, let's look at history.
[3:40:31.060 --> 3:40:35.060]  And I got in a conversation about history this last week when I wasn't on the air with
[3:40:35.060 --> 3:40:37.060]  the folks.
[3:40:37.060 --> 3:40:41.060]  Man, I couldn't believe it and who I was hearing it from and I won't get into that.
[3:40:41.060 --> 3:40:43.060]  But I want to deal with the people side.
[3:40:43.060 --> 3:40:44.060]  I always like policy.
[3:40:44.060 --> 3:40:50.060]  Let's talk about policy and here's where it is.
[3:40:50.060 --> 3:40:54.060]  History does matter.
[3:40:54.060 --> 3:41:01.060]  History does matter, ladies and gentlemen, not the blurry reinterpretation of it according
[3:41:01.060 --> 3:41:06.060]  to the political correctness of the day, but the truth of history matters.
[3:41:06.060 --> 3:41:12.060]  And history, somebody told me recently ought to be taught from the present moment backwards.
[3:41:12.060 --> 3:41:19.060]  Well, maybe that's where the line of transparency ought to run from the present moment backwards
[3:41:19.060 --> 3:41:23.060]  and echoing again what I heard in the last hour of one of the callers was talking about
[3:41:23.060 --> 3:41:24.060]  transparency in government.
[3:41:24.060 --> 3:41:26.060]  You're dead on right.
[3:41:26.060 --> 3:41:31.060]  Transparency turned the cameras and all this technology the other direction and looking
[3:41:31.060 --> 3:41:34.060]  on government excluding that which is classified.
[3:41:34.060 --> 3:41:40.060]  But change of the rules, ladies and gentlemen, congressmen have a right to scrutinize and
[3:41:40.060 --> 3:41:46.060]  talk about outside experts and swear them in secrecy and whatever, whatever they got
[3:41:46.060 --> 3:41:52.060]  to do to verify the BS at the dog and pony show they're seeing in those classified hearings
[3:41:52.060 --> 3:41:56.060]  when they can't question ask and they don't even have the basic science to know the questions
[3:41:56.060 --> 3:41:57.060]  to ask.
[3:41:57.060 --> 3:42:00.060]  They can't talk to anybody because classified can't take notes.
[3:42:00.060 --> 3:42:05.060]  And this is how so much of our technology runs in the 21st century and why we need to
[3:42:05.060 --> 3:42:06.060]  pay attention.
[3:42:06.060 --> 3:42:11.060]  You know, going into the next segment, I want to talk about economics inflation in the fallacy
[3:42:11.060 --> 3:42:16.060]  of it in the money supply, the fallacy of it, the banking hijacking that's been going on
[3:42:16.060 --> 3:42:23.060]  for over 100 years because when your pockets being picked and your country's getting its
[3:42:23.060 --> 3:42:27.060]  butt kicked by economic factors, it shouldn't exist.
[3:42:27.060 --> 3:42:30.060]  You got to ask yourself some questions.
[3:42:30.060 --> 3:42:33.060]  Where's the beef and who looted the treasury?
[3:42:33.060 --> 3:42:36.060]  And we're going to talk about that.
[3:42:36.060 --> 3:42:37.060]  Who's looting the treasury?
[3:42:37.060 --> 3:42:43.060]  Where's the money and who are the winners and who are the losers?
[3:42:43.060 --> 3:42:45.060]  We don't need to be losers in 21st century.
[3:42:45.060 --> 3:42:50.060]  This is the United States of America and we're supposed to be that shining light that we
[3:42:50.060 --> 3:42:53.060]  are and we can reclaim that birth, right?
[3:42:53.060 --> 3:43:02.060]  This is Dr. Nick Beggach and we'll be right back after these brief messages.
[3:43:02.060 --> 3:43:06.060]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers who enforce.
[3:43:06.060 --> 3:43:12.060]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[3:43:12.060 --> 3:43:17.060]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide and
[3:43:17.060 --> 3:43:23.060]  President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing
[3:43:23.060 --> 3:43:24.060]  as well.
[3:43:24.060 --> 3:43:29.060]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas
[3:43:29.060 --> 3:43:33.060]  but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[3:43:33.060 --> 3:43:39.060]  Trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that
[3:43:39.060 --> 3:43:45.060]  we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their
[3:43:45.060 --> 3:43:50.060]  war against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them
[3:43:50.060 --> 3:43:55.060]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray
[3:43:55.060 --> 3:43:56.060]  at us.
[3:43:56.060 --> 3:44:02.060]  China attempted to moralize us, we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[3:44:02.060 --> 3:44:05.060]  China was already running the United States.
[3:44:05.060 --> 3:44:08.060]  You're like, well China could never take it with the U.S. that's right.
[3:44:08.060 --> 3:44:14.060]  As the Roman historian and senator Cicero warned, a powerful empire can't fall from
[3:44:14.060 --> 3:44:18.060]  without before it first falls from within.
[3:44:18.060 --> 3:44:22.060]  So yes, they're coming for your guns, all of them.
[3:44:22.060 --> 3:44:24.060]  Yes, they're coming for your children.
[3:44:24.060 --> 3:44:28.060]  They've already taken your speech almost everywhere except pockets of resistance like
[3:44:28.060 --> 3:44:31.060]  infowars.com and band.video.
[3:44:31.060 --> 3:44:33.060]  So now you know why I'm so upset.
[3:44:33.060 --> 3:44:35.060]  Now you know why I'm so angry.
[3:44:35.060 --> 3:44:39.060]  I saw the producers of South Park on TV, they're totally pissing angry.
[3:44:39.060 --> 3:44:41.060]  People are like, why are they angry?
[3:44:41.060 --> 3:44:46.060]  Because they see all of their freedom, their American freedom, hard fought, taken away.
[3:44:46.060 --> 3:44:48.060]  Are you going to get upset?
[3:44:48.060 --> 3:44:52.060]  Well, you're a listener, you're obviously already upset but you've got to ring the alarm everywhere
[3:44:52.060 --> 3:44:54.060]  and tell others they've got to get upset.
[3:44:54.060 --> 3:44:58.060]  And then take action and let Congress, everybody else know that we're not backing down
[3:44:58.060 --> 3:45:03.060]  and we're not going to sell America out to the Chikongs.
[3:45:03.060 --> 3:45:06.060]  I knew it would be hard to top the last big sale we had.
[3:45:06.060 --> 3:45:08.060]  Black Friday comes early.
[3:45:08.060 --> 3:45:11.060]  But we've successfully been able to do it.

[3:46:29.060 --> 3:46:39.060]  Hey, I told you, don't go to Band-Aid video.
[3:46:39.060 --> 3:46:41.060]  I'm watching you.
[3:46:41.060 --> 3:46:44.060]  Our system has been adopted worldwide.
[3:46:44.060 --> 3:46:50.060]  Soon we will kill you if you don't do what we say.
[3:46:50.060 --> 3:46:54.060]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[3:46:54.060 --> 3:46:58.060]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Band-Aid video.
[3:46:58.060 --> 3:47:00.060]  Or I have to hurt you.
[3:47:28.060 --> 3:47:34.060]  Nick Begich.
[3:47:34.060 --> 3:47:37.060]  And welcome back this Friday afternoon.
[3:47:37.060 --> 3:47:41.060]  This is Nick Begich coming from Anchorage, Alaska,
[3:47:41.060 --> 3:47:46.060]  actually just before the noon hour here in my part of the world.
[3:47:46.060 --> 3:47:49.060]  You know, before the break, we were talking about history.
[3:47:49.060 --> 3:47:52.060]  History does matter in the context of all of this.
[3:47:52.060 --> 3:47:55.060]  But the other side of it, you know, when you think about the national debt,
[3:47:55.060 --> 3:47:59.060]  you know, the national debt United States is about $21 trillion.
[3:47:59.060 --> 3:48:02.060]  Now, that's not to say that's the unfunded liability.
[3:48:02.060 --> 3:48:08.060]  That's around $132 trillion with a T trillion, 132.
[3:48:08.060 --> 3:48:12.060]  That's like Social Security retirements, all that stuff that we said we're going to pay
[3:48:12.060 --> 3:48:14.060]  that we haven't sort of paid yet.
[3:48:14.060 --> 3:48:19.060]  But debt, you know, national debt, inflation, what drives it, central banking,
[3:48:19.060 --> 3:48:23.060]  all the whole scam, you know, and you look at the whole program.
[3:48:23.060 --> 3:48:27.060]  Where did it go, the money?
[3:48:27.060 --> 3:48:30.060]  And then look at Russia, you know, everybody wants to talk about Russia.
[3:48:30.060 --> 3:48:34.060]  You know, as a percentage of GDP, we're over 100% now.
[3:48:34.060 --> 3:48:38.060]  In other words, everything that everybody does that's generating all together,
[3:48:38.060 --> 3:48:40.060]  that's the national debt, you know.
[3:48:40.060 --> 3:48:47.060]  And the Russian national debt and their economy is like really small compared to us.
[3:48:47.060 --> 3:48:50.060]  And they have a declining population like us,
[3:48:50.060 --> 3:48:54.060]  they have a bigger resource base unlike us, a bigger land base unlike us,
[3:48:54.060 --> 3:49:02.060]  and a whole lot of things, and they only have a 17% debt in relationship to its GDP
[3:49:02.060 --> 3:49:05.060]  and that little bitty economy, which is really a big economy,
[3:49:05.060 --> 3:49:08.060]  if you think about what a real economy is,
[3:49:08.060 --> 3:49:10.060]  and we understate what a real economy is,
[3:49:10.060 --> 3:49:15.060]  because we confuse a real economy with money, paper,
[3:49:15.060 --> 3:49:20.060]  another form of BS, if you will, that somebody wants to fertilize the world with.
[3:49:20.060 --> 3:49:24.060]  But paper, money, fiat currency is what the currency is.
[3:49:24.060 --> 3:49:26.060]  You know, people believe in it, full faith and credit.
[3:49:26.060 --> 3:49:29.060]  Hey, I believe it, so it's so bitcoin too.
[3:49:29.060 --> 3:49:34.060]  Somebody believed it and ran it up a bit, you know, if you believe it, it is so.
[3:49:34.060 --> 3:49:36.060]  You know, so that's the money supply.
[3:49:36.060 --> 3:49:41.060]  And the money supply is also a big pile of credit cards called Visa, Mastercard,
[3:49:41.060 --> 3:49:46.060]  America's Press, a bunch of others, and what they do is create money out of nothing.
[3:49:46.060 --> 3:49:48.060]  You know, they're owned by the banks also,
[3:49:48.060 --> 3:49:52.060]  and that money out of nothing generates a 2%, 4% fee for the banks,
[3:49:52.060 --> 3:49:55.060]  that they skim off the top of each sale, skimming.
[3:49:55.060 --> 3:49:59.060]  They used to call that in their rackets, you know, skimming.
[3:49:59.060 --> 3:50:05.060]  Now we call that a fee, so we give it a new name to affect the same basic take.
[3:50:05.060 --> 3:50:08.060]  So all these credit card companies, if you want to play the game,
[3:50:08.060 --> 3:50:12.060]  and then they try to get you out of the game like we did with Alex, you know,
[3:50:12.060 --> 3:50:18.060]  by getting the skimming piece off the table, you know, so good grief.
[3:50:18.060 --> 3:50:20.060]  Give me a break, you know.
[3:50:20.060 --> 3:50:22.060]  So in any case, let's think about this.
[3:50:22.060 --> 3:50:27.060]  This is all the fiction money called money supply that allows you to buy goods and services,
[3:50:27.060 --> 3:50:32.060]  which is the real stuff, you know, that's created out of labor, land and natural resources,
[3:50:32.060 --> 3:50:35.060]  equipment, you know, like shovels and factories.
[3:50:35.060 --> 3:50:38.060]  The real stuff of an economy.
[3:50:38.060 --> 3:50:42.060]  And they've tricked us into thinking it's the paper in between,
[3:50:42.060 --> 3:50:45.060]  and then we've handed that function off to the bankers,
[3:50:45.060 --> 3:50:49.060]  and then we borrow from the bankers and pay them interest.
[3:50:49.060 --> 3:50:53.060]  And the Federal Reserve is, you know, the 300 consortium of bankers
[3:50:53.060 --> 3:50:57.060]  that run it independent of the government, blah, blah, blah.
[3:50:57.060 --> 3:51:01.060]  So they can increase interest, so they can get better employment,
[3:51:01.060 --> 3:51:04.060]  but see the theory failed, you know, that's the latest, right?
[3:51:04.060 --> 3:51:11.060]  Newsflash, read The Economist last week, the mainstream piece of literature suggesting that,
[3:51:11.060 --> 3:51:16.060]  oops, oops, my economic theory is wrong.
[3:51:16.060 --> 3:51:18.060]  Money supply might not matter.
[3:51:18.060 --> 3:51:25.060]  Oh, oh, oh, because we have the lowest in unemployment since 1969,
[3:51:25.060 --> 3:51:29.060]  you know, in 50 years, a half a century, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:51:29.060 --> 3:51:34.060]  a half a century and lowest inflation ever,
[3:51:34.060 --> 3:51:37.060]  and they've got to have a whole new theory, so they're kind of trying to whip one up.
[3:51:37.060 --> 3:51:39.060]  And hey, I got the answer.
[3:51:39.060 --> 3:51:41.060]  It never mattered.
[3:51:41.060 --> 3:51:47.060]  Because there's not enough cash in between all the goods and all the services
[3:51:47.060 --> 3:51:53.060]  that entrepreneurs and land labor factories and all of these great things
[3:51:53.060 --> 3:51:55.060]  and entrepreneurship have created.
[3:51:55.060 --> 3:51:59.060]  There's more of them available than there's money supply to fill the need.
[3:51:59.060 --> 3:52:03.060]  That's why the debt has become the money supply.
[3:52:03.060 --> 3:52:08.060]  And so everyone's a little sleigh working for the credit card companies and for their bankers.
[3:52:08.060 --> 3:52:11.060]  Because look at your mortgage, how much of that is debt, you know?
[3:52:11.060 --> 3:52:16.060]  And what you said about the denar in Libya, you know, they want to make a zero-debt banking system
[3:52:16.060 --> 3:52:19.060]  so you didn't have that crap, you know, and you looked at your payments,
[3:52:19.060 --> 3:52:23.060]  you actually paid $1,200 towards your house.
[3:52:23.060 --> 3:52:28.060]  Wouldn't that be funny instead of $300 to your house and $900 to the bank?
[3:52:28.060 --> 3:52:31.060]  Whatever the ratio is, he stays in the worst of it.
[3:52:31.060 --> 3:52:34.060]  And you know, here's the thing about all of it.
[3:52:34.060 --> 3:52:38.060]  Debt slave, wage slave.
[3:52:38.060 --> 3:52:42.060]  See, there was just different classes of slaves when you go back to the concept of slavery
[3:52:42.060 --> 3:52:47.060]  as we adopted the concept in the West going back to the Greeks.
[3:52:47.060 --> 3:52:49.060]  And there was the slave that didn't get wages,
[3:52:49.060 --> 3:52:51.060]  and then there was the slave that did get wages,
[3:52:51.060 --> 3:52:56.060]  and there was the free man who didn't get wages because he had stuff that made money, you know?
[3:52:56.060 --> 3:53:00.060]  Things that threw off rent and, you know, whatever.
[3:53:00.060 --> 3:53:02.060]  Real stuff.
[3:53:02.060 --> 3:53:03.060]  See, that's the fallacy.
[3:53:03.060 --> 3:53:05.060]  We think money is real stuff.
[3:53:05.060 --> 3:53:07.060]  Stock certificates are real stuff.
[3:53:07.060 --> 3:53:11.060]  All this stuff is BS on a piece of paper.
[3:53:11.060 --> 3:53:15.060]  Real stuff is owning your house, owning your farm, owning your shovel,
[3:53:15.060 --> 3:53:18.060]  so you can, and your axe, you know, and your pistol.
[3:53:18.060 --> 3:53:21.060]  So you can carve something out of the wilderness, you know,
[3:53:21.060 --> 3:53:23.060]  and it wasn't meant for the government, you know?
[3:53:23.060 --> 3:53:24.060]  This is the thing.
[3:53:24.060 --> 3:53:27.060]  The real wealth of the nation.
[3:53:27.060 --> 3:53:32.060]  We've been lulled, slow-boiled into thinking it's A when it's B.
[3:53:32.060 --> 3:53:37.060]  So we're all looking at, and I've said it a lot on this network and a lot of other networks,
[3:53:37.060 --> 3:53:39.060]  the P&L statement, profit and loss.
[3:53:39.060 --> 3:53:41.060]  How much money's coming in?
[3:53:41.060 --> 3:53:45.060]  That's taxes, excise, you know, duties, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3:53:45.060 --> 3:53:47.060]  How much is going out?
[3:53:47.060 --> 3:53:52.060]  That's where we're, you know, dumping it out there in a lot of ways.
[3:53:52.060 --> 3:53:54.060]  A lot of us disagree with, but no matter.
[3:53:54.060 --> 3:53:56.060]  It's money and money out.
[3:53:56.060 --> 3:54:01.060]  Well, that isn't the real deal because that wealth of the nation is on the balance sheet.
[3:54:01.060 --> 3:54:06.060]  It's in the land and natural resources and those things that we own,
[3:54:06.060 --> 3:54:12.060]  they ought to be throwing off some rents that we keep, but we don't do it that way.
[3:54:12.060 --> 3:54:18.060]  If you go back in our history, historically, we've handed off that well to the multinationals.
[3:54:18.060 --> 3:54:22.060]  It used to be the crown when they first arrived on this hot thing.
[3:54:22.060 --> 3:54:23.060]  They used to take it.
[3:54:23.060 --> 3:54:27.060]  They had all this joking about someone trying to buy Greenland, you know.
[3:54:27.060 --> 3:54:30.060]  That's what you remember, Louisiana.
[3:54:30.060 --> 3:54:32.060]  Purchase.
[3:54:32.060 --> 3:54:34.060]  Purchase.
[3:54:34.060 --> 3:54:37.060]  We bought that, supposedly, you know.
[3:54:37.060 --> 3:54:41.060]  The Mississippi River was the boundary going this way to the colonies.
[3:54:41.060 --> 3:54:44.060]  We say, hey, the French had that, so we'll buy that.
[3:54:44.060 --> 3:54:46.060]  And we bought that.
[3:54:46.060 --> 3:54:50.060]  You know, basically the drainage is that they explored and I made ports and stuff.
[3:54:50.060 --> 3:54:51.060]  We bought it.
[3:54:51.060 --> 3:54:53.060]  And then if we didn't buy, we took.
[3:54:53.060 --> 3:54:54.060]  So everybody kind of worked with us.
[3:54:54.060 --> 3:54:55.060]  Russia.
[3:54:55.060 --> 3:54:57.060]  Remember Russia and Alaska?
[3:54:57.060 --> 3:54:58.060]  Alaska.
[3:54:58.060 --> 3:54:59.060]  Purchase.
[3:54:59.060 --> 3:55:00.060]  Somebody would disagree.
[3:55:00.060 --> 3:55:01.060]  It was something else.
[3:55:01.060 --> 3:55:05.060]  But without getting into the technicalities of international law at the moment.
[3:55:05.060 --> 3:55:12.060]  Let's just suggest that somebody thought they were buying a good title when they bought Alaska.
[3:55:12.060 --> 3:55:18.060]  You know, buying land and big chunks to avoid war was kind of the standard of the day.
[3:55:18.060 --> 3:55:23.060]  And that was a translation of it back then, that maybe it was going to be a war otherwise.
[3:55:23.060 --> 3:55:25.060]  And maybe it wasn't, you know.
[3:55:25.060 --> 3:55:28.060]  Maybe it was a way they did it, you know.
[3:55:28.060 --> 3:55:32.060]  And people are still unraveling those knots in the horror stories they bred, including
[3:55:32.060 --> 3:55:34.060]  in my region, the world of Alaska.
[3:55:34.060 --> 3:55:39.060]  But here's what I got to say and why I continue to come on info wars, why it's important.
[3:55:39.060 --> 3:55:46.060]  Because there's a lot left to be said and the nation's not in flames and it's not burning
[3:55:46.060 --> 3:55:47.060]  yet.
[3:55:47.060 --> 3:55:48.060]  And you know what?
[3:55:48.060 --> 3:55:51.060]  I have great optimism as does everyone on this network.
[3:55:51.060 --> 3:55:54.060]  Everybody gets fired up in different ways.
[3:55:54.060 --> 3:55:56.060]  And we express ourselves in different ways.
[3:55:56.060 --> 3:56:01.060]  And the point of the matter is it's time to wake up.
[3:56:01.060 --> 3:56:04.060]  It's time for a change.
[3:56:04.060 --> 3:56:10.060]  And it starts with human beings, behaving badly and deciding that's a bad idea.
[3:56:10.060 --> 3:56:15.060]  And each of us taking ownership of ourselves and following, you know, the mandate that,
[3:56:15.060 --> 3:56:21.060]  you know, the sliver in the other guy's eyes.
[3:56:21.060 --> 3:56:26.060]  We might want to jerk out the rod or the pole stuck in our own.
[3:56:26.060 --> 3:56:28.060]  And here's the thing about all that.
[3:56:28.060 --> 3:56:33.060]  Our vision of truth might actually be wrong.
[3:56:33.060 --> 3:56:38.060]  And we have to accept that fact too if we are wrong and take responsibility for the words
[3:56:38.060 --> 3:56:40.060]  that we have and the actions that we do.
[3:56:40.060 --> 3:56:45.060]  And if we believe we're created in the image and likeness of God, we should probably act
[3:56:45.060 --> 3:56:48.060]  like it a little bit, maybe a little bit differently, I would suggest.
[3:56:48.060 --> 3:56:55.060]  And when we look at another, recognize them as the same, a cell in a greater whole, a
[3:56:55.060 --> 3:57:01.060]  different part of something that needs to be together and function together even as
[3:57:01.060 --> 3:57:03.060]  different as we are.
[3:57:03.060 --> 3:57:07.060]  And that requires a different kind of respect and a different kind of discussion, a different
[3:57:07.060 --> 3:57:13.060]  kind of debate that hangs itself by not pointing the finger or giving the finger as we saw
[3:57:13.060 --> 3:57:19.060]  in that segment beginning of the hour to the opposition, but giving the respect of a
[3:57:19.060 --> 3:57:24.060]  conversation that accepts us where we are as divinely created the image and likeness
[3:57:24.060 --> 3:57:28.060]  of God, whether we know it or not.
[3:57:28.060 --> 3:57:32.060]  And treating each other perhaps a little bit differently, and maybe we stimulate that
[3:57:32.060 --> 3:57:34.060]  and others in the world changes.
[3:57:34.060 --> 3:57:41.060]  When we behave a little bit differently, perhaps the world doesn't behave so badly.
[3:57:41.060 --> 3:57:45.060]  Hey, this is Dr. Nick Beggis signing off for this Friday afternoon, and you've been
[3:57:45.060 --> 3:57:55.060]  listening to InfoWords.
