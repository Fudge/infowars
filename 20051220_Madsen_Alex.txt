[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.451]  The GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:14.437]  Blake Manson is an investigative journalist, nationally distributed columnist, and author who has covered DC politics, national security, and intelligence issues since 1994 when he got out of government.
[00:00:14.437 --> 00:00:21.161]  He's written for The Village Voice, The Progressive, CAQ, Counterpunch, The Intelligence Newsletter, based in Paris, Madison.
[00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:24.143]  He is an author of Genocide and Covert Operations in Africa.
[00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:32.231]  A co-author of America's Nightmare, The Presidency of George Bush II, and the forthcoming Jaded Test, Big Oil, Black Ops, Brass Place.
[00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:35.699]  I want to get that book in our bookstore when he comes out with it.
[00:00:36.597 --> 00:00:37.738]  And, uh, so much more.
[00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:40.900]  The Handbook of Personal Data Protection, London Macmillan, 92.
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.201]  That was a best seller.
[00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:43.723]  Madison is a former U.S.
[00:00:43.723 --> 00:00:47.265]  Naval officer who was assigned to the National Security Agency during the Reagan Administration.
[00:00:47.265 --> 00:00:50.328]  He also had some 20 years' experience in computer security and data privacy.
[00:00:50.328 --> 00:01:00.675]  He's also worked at the National Data Automation Command, Department of State, RCA Corporation, and Computer Science Corporation that bought Dyncor, by the way, and doesn't like me too much.
[00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:03.277]  Got the direct word they're angry with me here locally.
[00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:04.979]  Just say hi to those boys.
[00:01:05.903 --> 00:01:11.572]  And before I go any further, Wayne Madsen, I appreciate joining us today on short notice.
[00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:17.422]  I want to quickly go back to that one caller that I was just talking to before the break.
[00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:19.982]  Thanks for holding me over, Alex.
[00:01:19.982 --> 00:01:22.204]  I'm also looking forward to hearing Wayne's interview with you.
[00:01:22.204 --> 00:01:24.946]  The reason I say I'm optimistic is because here's a guy, Bush.
[00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:47.143]  I mean, it's a blue moon when he does a press release or a press conference and addresses to the nation.
[00:01:47.143 --> 00:01:48.663]  And we got three in a row!
[00:01:48.663 --> 00:01:51.084]  He hates these like the devil hates holy water.
[00:01:51.084 --> 00:01:52.684]  And he's got to do more spinning.
[00:01:52.684 --> 00:01:56.605]  He's done more spinning in the past week than he's done in about three years.
[00:01:56.605 --> 00:02:03.547]  So I think the message is getting out, and I think a lot of these politicians are getting a lot of questions and a lot of very furrowed brows from people.
[00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:05.187]  And one last thing, Alex, before I go.
[00:02:05.768 --> 00:02:12.019]  My new selectman, the old one who wanted to combine the police and the National Guard, got defeated for the last election.
[00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:18.992]  And I told her about your website and she wants some DVDs and I'm going to make them to her and I'm going to give them to her before the end of the year.
[00:02:20.043 --> 00:02:20.383]  Good.
[00:02:20.383 --> 00:02:21.724]  You keep it up and God bless you.
[00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:22.324]  Thank you Alex.
[00:02:22.324 --> 00:02:24.185]  It's people like that that are saving this country.
[00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:25.285]  They didn't about left or right.
[00:02:25.285 --> 00:02:27.986]  Bill Clinton spied on you.
[00:02:27.986 --> 00:02:30.167]  Back in Kennedy's day they did.
[00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:32.368]  But now it's mechanized.
[00:02:32.368 --> 00:02:33.168]  And I hope you're right.
[00:02:33.168 --> 00:02:37.070]  I hope Bush is giving three mindless speeches because he is in trouble.
[00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.750]  But I'm telling you,
[00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:42.895]  The globalists can't carry out another attack because people will say, oh, you screwed up.
[00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:50.278]  But if they can act like we defeated the Patriot Act, and then harp on how we tied their hands, they can get a lot of gas mileage out of it.
[00:02:50.278 --> 00:02:52.199]  We've already stopped them carrying out other attacks.
[00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.159]  Believe me, folks.
[00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.140]  By being bold, by being out in the open.
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.663]  We'll find out if Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.com agrees with us on that.
[00:03:00.663 --> 00:03:01.303]  But I know this.
[00:03:01.303 --> 00:03:02.884]  James Bamford reported on it.
[00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:04.845]  He was there at the time.
[00:03:04.845 --> 00:03:05.445]  Our guest was.
[00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:10.326]  The NSA has been spying on us since it was set up.
[00:03:10.326 --> 00:03:17.308]  And most of it is economic spying on companies and giving it to select military industrial complex companies.
[00:03:17.308 --> 00:03:22.309]  It's also about mapping trends and trying to basically beat people to the punch on that.
[00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:23.990]  It's about insider trading.
[00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.850]  It's about controlling this big scam.
[00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.831]  Wayne Madsen, thank you for joining us, sir.
[00:03:27.831 --> 00:03:28.551]  Good to be with you.
[00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:33.074]  Do you agree with my ramblings that I was just spewing?
[00:03:33.074 --> 00:03:40.278]  Well, one thing, we know that NSA was basically not regulated.
[00:03:40.278 --> 00:03:50.685]  And we know that from the Vietnam War days and the Watergate era that NSA was doing a lot of this political spying internally.
[00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:53.126]  And then, of course, we had hearings.
[00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:55.627]  We had Frank Church in the Senate.
[00:03:55.627 --> 00:03:59.368]  We had Otis Pike and Bella Abzug over on the household hearings.
[00:03:59.368 --> 00:04:00.948]  This isn't our first rodeo.
[00:04:00.948 --> 00:04:01.828]  No, no.
[00:04:01.828 --> 00:04:13.091]  And what we got out of this was the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which limited what NSA could do and set up this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that said that NSA could only eavesdrop on U.S.
[00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:13.591]  persons.
[00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:15.371]  And that's the U.S.
[00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:19.172]  companies, individuals, green card holders living in the United States.
[00:04:19.981 --> 00:04:25.204]  They could only do that if there was a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
[00:04:25.204 --> 00:04:33.608]  What Bush has done with this administration by FIAT is he's just ignored the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
[00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:36.169]  He said, I don't need the court, I don't need the law.
[00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.731]  And he said he wants it, just fills out their own national security letter.
[00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:40.551]  Well, that's right.
[00:04:40.551 --> 00:04:44.653]  In my opinion also, I think the reason this was leaked by senior people at the NSA is
[00:04:45.194 --> 00:04:49.589]  Is that they know it was illegal and they don't want to go back to those bad old days and um...
[00:04:50.174 --> 00:04:51.814]  And they know he violated the law?
[00:04:51.814 --> 00:04:53.135]  Well, Wayne, you're an expert on this.
[00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:54.475]  I mean, I'm not just saying this.
[00:04:54.475 --> 00:04:58.476]  I read your reporting and it's heads above so many other people that just don't know.
[00:04:58.476 --> 00:05:00.156]  I mean, I read them like, yeah, this guy's right on.
[00:05:00.156 --> 00:05:03.137]  Just from my experience dealing with these people.
[00:05:03.137 --> 00:05:08.759]  I mean, ten years ago, I'd be at a Second Amendment rally and have guys on a roof in camo taking photos of me.
[00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:15.680]  So all this stuff about the military takes photos of us and is watching us, that's never stopped since Vietnam.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.221]  Quite frankly, I think it's increased.
[00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:18.301]  What I know about NSA,
[00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:19.282]  We're good to go.
[00:05:34.582 --> 00:05:45.505]  I'm not saying there aren't good people there at NSA, Wayne, but certainly there are compartments that you were never even connected to, and we know that there are zealots who are out there who enjoy doing all of this.
[00:05:45.505 --> 00:05:50.527]  We know in 96 they put in all the NSA hubs and the whole telecommunications system.
[00:05:50.527 --> 00:05:53.768]  We know that all the cell phones are tracked and can be listened to.
[00:05:53.768 --> 00:05:55.288]  We know OnStar does it.
[00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:58.049]  I mean, everybody's freaking out about these new revelations.
[00:05:58.049 --> 00:06:01.450]  My point is that it's been institutionalized at every level.
[00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.370]  That's right.
[00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:13.155]  I think the problem in NSA is that the senior management levels, the people who do the work, the analysts, linguists, the mathematicians, they know what the law is.
[00:06:13.155 --> 00:06:14.856]  They're briefed on that.
[00:06:14.856 --> 00:06:19.819]  They have an internal bible called USID 18, United States Signals Intelligence Directive 18.
[00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:24.621]  It says they're not allowed to conduct surveillance of US persons unless
[00:06:25.174 --> 00:06:33.996]  Uh... certain requirements are met, one of which is of course that there's been a court order, there's been authorization through the liaison with the Justice Department.
[00:06:33.996 --> 00:06:38.157]  But now he wants to prosecute whoever's leaking.
[00:06:38.157 --> 00:06:51.480]  It's like he wanted to prosecute the person who leaked the covert name of a CIA agent, Valerie Plain Wilson, and of course he can't prosecute that person because it looks like that person was Dick Cheney, his own vice president.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.001]  Well, I totally agree with you on that.
[00:06:54.001 --> 00:06:54.281]  Wayne,
[00:06:55.265 --> 00:07:00.050]  Yeah, I mean Bush is up there saying the Patriot Act is good and never been used against U.S.
[00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.951]  citizens.
[00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:07.739]  I have them using the Patriot Act to go to a college senior who his professor said go check out Mao's Red Book and write a report on it.
[00:07:07.739 --> 00:07:12.083]  I mean the political science class is about command and control economies.
[00:07:12.083 --> 00:07:16.108]  And so Homeland Security comes out and toy store owners, I mean we know the list.
[00:07:16.808 --> 00:07:21.532]  Watching Bush's speeches, I mean, what is it like for you to watch 100% pure lies?
[00:07:21.532 --> 00:07:22.313]  I can't take it.
[00:07:22.313 --> 00:07:39.428]  I mean, it's, uh, I mean, it's, it's, it's, well, I mean, after living in Washington for as long as I have, I, you know, I used to listen to speeches by Ronald Reagan, and of course, although they didn't contain much substance, at least you could, you could sit there and listen to them.
[00:07:39.428 --> 00:07:43.111]  I mean, uh, but this, uh, this guy is so vacuous, and, and,
[00:07:43.702 --> 00:07:45.484]  Uh, there's just nothing there.
[00:07:45.484 --> 00:07:47.165]  There's no there there with him.
[00:07:47.165 --> 00:07:54.311]  And everything that he was saying last night was obviously pre-canned, written by all these political advisors.
[00:07:54.311 --> 00:08:01.277]  And his speech, his news conference today, was Kallsten and all this Imperial Presidency stuff.
[00:08:01.277 --> 00:08:03.739]  He's relying on Article 2 of the Constitution.
[00:08:04.164 --> 00:08:09.749]  But the framers of that constitution wrote that because they never wanted another King George.
[00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:13.832]  And we got another King George apparently through the back door.
[00:08:13.832 --> 00:08:17.915]  Well, later I'm going to play a clip, and I want to back that up, John, to the point you had it at.
[00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:24.783]  Where Gonzales, the Attorney General, the same guy that says Bush is the law, says it again.
[00:08:24.783 --> 00:08:27.264]  He says he has this executive power.
[00:08:27.264 --> 00:08:32.166]  In Bush's press conference, Bragg, hey, I can ban you asking questions from executive order.
[00:08:32.166 --> 00:08:32.966]  Executive order?
[00:08:32.966 --> 00:08:36.728]  He signs an executive order saying we all gotta paint ourselves green, Wayne, we don't have to do it.
[00:08:36.728 --> 00:08:44.871]  Well, that's right, and the thing with Bush, but the reason Bush got away with this, and he keeps saying, well, the Congress gave me the authorization, the Congress did this,
[00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:59.202]  That is a Republican Congress that gave him that authorization, and people need to understand that next November, that this Congress has become a rubber stamp, a rump organization for this administration.
[00:08:59.202 --> 00:09:04.304]  An independent Congress would have never given him that kind of authorization, but he can use those.
[00:09:04.304 --> 00:09:08.945]  He can use the Congress like the Soviet Politburo used to use these rubber stamp bodies.
[00:09:10.445 --> 00:09:12.247]  Chamber of People's Deputies.
[00:09:12.247 --> 00:09:14.389]  I mean, this was just all kinds of nonsense.
[00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:15.730]  Let's get something else straight here.
[00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:25.638]  With Abel, Danger, with Clinton and Bush, with all of it, any time NSA or Defense Intelligence had the smoking gun, they would come back to them and say, back off.
[00:09:25.638 --> 00:09:29.502]  When the Defense Language School deans going, why am I training these Arabs?
[00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:31.383]  Muhammad Adam, by the way.
[00:09:31.383 --> 00:09:35.347]  When they're at Pensacola Naval Air Station, people go, these are terrorists, leave them alone.
[00:09:35.347 --> 00:09:36.788]  Clearly they were government agents.
[00:09:37.128 --> 00:09:44.372]  But every time NSA did do its job overseas, or every time an embassy didn't want to let the hijackers back in, they were told back off.
[00:09:44.372 --> 00:09:45.413]  Give us your take on that.
[00:09:45.413 --> 00:09:48.875]  I mean, clearly, our government is protecting the terrorists.
[00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:52.477]  Not only protected them, but they basically groomed them.
[00:09:52.477 --> 00:10:01.882]  I go back to 1986, and I've got something on my website today showing a memo from a conservative, something called the Conservative Network
[00:10:02.347 --> 00:10:24.758]  about posting parties here in Washington for international freedom fighters that included not only the Nicaraguan Contras and the Southeast Asian Guerrillas but the Afghan Mujahideen and they were at the time tied in and linked up with the Saudis who were funding Osama Bin Laden and all his confederates
[00:10:25.174 --> 00:10:27.777]  In that Mujahideen, one of their veterans is now the U.S.
[00:10:27.777 --> 00:10:32.722]  Ambassador to Iraq, coincidentally, Zalmay Khalilzad.
[00:10:32.722 --> 00:10:42.994]  So, yeah, not only... I mean, you can trace the support for these people back to the 1980s, and the guy that was supporting that network was a guy named Jack Abramoff.
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.882]  And his confederate, Grover Norquist.
[00:10:46.882 --> 00:10:48.823]  Look at all the trouble they're in right now.
[00:10:48.823 --> 00:10:56.570]  So, understand folks, when Bush says, I'm doing this to keep you safe while our borders are wide open, understand, it's pure baloney.
[00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.293]  These supposed hijackers were given top spy training.
[00:11:00.293 --> 00:11:03.035]  They were government operatives, Wayne.
[00:11:03.035 --> 00:11:04.917]  Well, look, everybody knows
[00:11:05.393 --> 00:11:09.494]  That there was all kinds of hanky-panky going on before 9-11.
[00:11:09.494 --> 00:11:10.915]  Abel Danger shows that.
[00:11:10.915 --> 00:11:21.237]  What about, you know, there's the Israeli art students who are really Israeli intelligence agents that were living in the same neighborhoods, drinking in the same bars, running videos from the same video rental stores.
[00:11:21.237 --> 00:11:24.318]  Handling the FBI operatives in the houses!
[00:11:24.318 --> 00:11:24.938]  That's right.
[00:11:24.938 --> 00:11:30.800]  And that the people like John O'Neill who were trying to track this down were stymied at every turn.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.001]  I've also been informed of other FBI agents who were
[00:11:34.301 --> 00:11:34.681]  We're good to go.
[00:11:56.198 --> 00:12:05.202]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms at 66 million, or 1 in 3 adults?
[00:12:05.202 --> 00:12:10.284]  Or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[00:12:10.284 --> 00:12:14.186]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[00:12:14.566 --> 00:12:20.030]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:30.216]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like Joint Care, whose safety and effectiveness in supporting healthy joints has been established in over 50 clinical trials and research studies.
[00:12:30.536 --> 00:12:37.901]  Joint care facilitates freedom of movement by promoting circulation and enhancing the overall functioning of the musculoskeletal system.

[00:12:59.648 --> 00:13:04.092]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:13:04.092 --> 00:13:07.054]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:13:07.054 --> 00:13:09.656]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:18.502]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:13:18.502 --> 00:13:20.043]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[00:13:20.043 --> 00:13:24.206]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:13:24.506 --> 00:13:25.146]  We're good to go!
[00:13:43.473 --> 00:13:46.219]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:13:56.357 --> 00:14:00.278]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:14:00.278 --> 00:14:04.099]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[00:14:22.366 --> 00:14:30.492]  This detailed report will provide you with financial history on the safest and most profitable areas to invest in, if you read the report.
[00:14:30.492 --> 00:14:34.655]  Alright, here is Gonzales, and then this goes on.
[00:14:34.655 --> 00:14:37.137]  I'll play more of it later.
[00:14:37.137 --> 00:14:40.099]  But here's Gonzales on national television, NBC.
[00:14:41.505 --> 00:14:47.088]  And he's just, now listen to what he says, the President has this executive power.
[00:14:47.088 --> 00:14:51.269]  No, the President doesn't have the power to violate the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:57.912]  This is the same guy, the same Attorney General who said, Bush, we're allowed to torture people until they die if we just don't call it torture.
[00:14:57.912 --> 00:15:10.758]  That's like saying you can drink 14 vodkas and go down the road drunk and run over a little kid, you know, jump the curb and run over some kid on his bike and when the kid's all splattered and dead and the cops get there and go, well I don't call this vodka, I call it water!
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.103]  So let's go ahead and play this buffoon.
[00:15:13.103 --> 00:15:14.105]  Here it is.
[00:15:14.105 --> 00:15:21.760]  Does the president have to avoid the normal process of obtaining court approved search warrants before eavesdropping is conducted?
[00:15:22.628 --> 00:15:40.993]  Katie, we believe the President has inherent authority as Commander-in-Chief under the Constitution to engage in signal intelligence of our enemy, but we also believe that the President has the authority under the Authorization to Use Military Force, which was passed by the Congress just days after the attacks of 9-11.
[00:15:40.993 --> 00:15:51.916]  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act does require a court order to engage in the kind of electronic surveillance the President talked about on Saturday, except as otherwise authorized by statute.
[00:15:52.416 --> 00:16:04.541]  We believe that authorization to use military force constitutes that statute which does give permission for the President of the United States to engage in this kind of very limited, targeted, electronic surveillance against our enemies.
[00:16:04.541 --> 00:16:10.844]  Well, apparently some members of Congress disagree with you because there's been an outcry... Alright, that's enough right there.
[00:16:10.844 --> 00:16:11.684]  We'll play the rest later.
[00:16:11.684 --> 00:16:17.446]  But here's the point, folks.
[00:16:17.446 --> 00:16:19.687]  He can say it's constitutional all day.
[00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:21.268]  That doesn't make it
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.664]  Constitutional.
[00:16:23.664 --> 00:16:26.330]  And I want to get a comment from Wayne Manson on that, Wayne.
[00:16:27.109 --> 00:16:49.240]  Well, I mean, when he says that surveillance was limited, actually, Gonzales doesn't know what he's talking about, because the nature of modern telecommunications is that when you attempt to target one individual, you're picking up an awful lot of other communications as well.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.261]  And this is fishnet intelligence gathering.
[00:16:53.239 --> 00:16:55.220]  And furthermore... Look at what it does!
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:00.223]  They just let the NSA, they sign a letter and then the NSA can go out and spy on thousands of phones!
[00:17:00.223 --> 00:17:01.223]  It's even worse than that.
[00:17:01.223 --> 00:17:14.610]  People in the NSA have told me that they call some operations training exercises because they don't have to keep logbooks, they don't have to have any... They're supposed to get rid of all that information afterwards, but they're not doing it and this is a way to get around
[00:17:15.214 --> 00:17:21.237]  Uh... the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that I used at 18 and all the other uh... controls that were put in place.
[00:17:21.237 --> 00:17:40.164]  They just call the training exercise uh... the intelligence, the intercepts go to uh... like Cheney's office or Bush or GOP operatives and there's no record that NSA held on those operations and that was all... You've got a report here and it says NSA intercepts for Bolton were masked as training exercises.
[00:17:40.164 --> 00:17:41.945]  This guy wouldn't lie about the uh...
[00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:47.872]  Yellow Cake Uranium, well it turns out they're out snooping around with the NSA there.
[00:17:47.872 --> 00:17:49.673]  I guess he's with Al Qaeda too?
[00:17:49.673 --> 00:18:03.658]  Oh yeah, well they were also eavesdropping on Bolton was using the NSA to eavesdrop on his own boss, Colin Powell, who had conversations with Governor Bill Richardson in New Mexico.
[00:18:03.658 --> 00:18:07.960]  So if they're saying that Richardson and Powell are members of Al Qaeda, that's a
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.123]  That's interesting to me.
[00:18:10.123 --> 00:18:17.914]  I just wonder when Richardson and Powell are going to be picked up and sent to Guantanamo to be tortured.
[00:18:17.914 --> 00:18:19.497]  It's incredible.
[00:18:19.497 --> 00:18:23.563]  I mean look, Wayne, ten years ago, and I got video of this, I made films about it.
[00:18:24.386 --> 00:18:29.750]  I'm out at a pretty milquetoast event, mainstream groups there, and there's guys in camo on top roofs.
[00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:34.854]  Well now, I'll be at the RNC, they'll just march right up in camo and start videoing.
[00:18:34.854 --> 00:18:36.275]  Regular Army!
[00:18:36.275 --> 00:18:39.197]  And we hear about them going into peace groups, conservative groups.
[00:18:40.037 --> 00:18:47.259]  Uh, you know, the Army surveilling local student groups that don't want them recruiting in their public schools, so the Army starts watching them.
[00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:58.702]  I mean, this was all going on before 9-11, now it's gotten worse, but then Bush gets on TV and says, everything's fine, we're not surveilling you, the Pentagon isn't watching you, and I've had physical assets, buddy, following me around.
[00:18:59.202 --> 00:19:01.364]  Well, yes, and I've seen it too.
[00:19:01.364 --> 00:19:13.194]  I started seeing it at these anti-World Bank demonstrations where clearly people in uniform were taking photographs of the people who had legal permits to demonstrate against the World Bank meetings.
[00:19:14.308 --> 00:19:18.389]  So this is nothing new, but you're right, it's getting much worse.
[00:19:18.389 --> 00:19:31.893]  I think we're turning into sort of like East Germany was with the Stasi, when we know from the East German files that 25% of the population of East Germany were informants and spying on their neighbors and even members of their own family.
[00:19:33.658 --> 00:19:44.487]  Wayne, I didn't believe it five years ago, three years ago, two years ago when I hear about Primakov being hired as a consultant or this guy or that guy, but then I did confirm our government has hired these guys as consultants.
[00:19:44.487 --> 00:19:46.388]  Then they said, oh, but it's for overseas.
[00:19:46.388 --> 00:19:48.330]  But then I learned they've been hired domestically.
[00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.473]  I mean, this is like a Twilight Zone episode.
[00:19:51.473 --> 00:19:55.476]  A very bad Twilight Zone.
[00:19:55.476 --> 00:19:58.218]  But then the NSA is tracking a real terrorist.
[00:19:58.218 --> 00:19:59.099]  What does Bush say?
[00:19:59.099 --> 00:20:00.019]  Back off.
[00:20:00.019 --> 00:20:00.440]  That's right.
[00:20:01.312 --> 00:20:01.812]  Wayne, stay there.
[00:20:01.812 --> 00:20:06.853]  I want to play another clip and get your take on it, and get your take on where you think everything's going.
[00:20:06.853 --> 00:20:09.854]  On the other side with Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com.
[00:20:09.854 --> 00:20:10.554]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:10.554 --> 00:20:22.637]  Be sure to visit PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com today as we defend the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:22.637 --> 00:20:23.598]  We're on the march.
[00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:26.558]  The empire's on the run.
[00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:29.219]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:40.298 --> 00:20:49.820]  Alright, I was talking to Wayne Madsen during the break, and we'll tell you about the points that he raised when we go back to him here in just one minute.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.861]  And we'll also play a clip of Bush.
[00:20:51.861 --> 00:20:53.741]  It's unbelievably disgusting.
[00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:56.822]  A little bit more of that clip with Alberto.
[00:20:56.822 --> 00:20:58.122]  Bush is above the law.
[00:20:58.122 --> 00:21:00.182]  I love torture.
[00:21:00.182 --> 00:21:03.563]  Gonzales, and I'm a member of a Mexican supremacist organization.
[00:21:04.432 --> 00:21:14.620]  Again, it is a Twilight Zone life, but if you want to see the troops training to take your guns, the troops training to confiscate your firearms and break your families up.
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.982]  These programs haven't gone away under Bush, they've expanded.
[00:21:16.982 --> 00:21:18.703]  I mean, I wouldn't cover this under Bill Clinton.
[00:21:18.703 --> 00:21:20.004]  He's just a puppet.
[00:21:20.004 --> 00:21:22.226]  Same thing with Bush.
[00:21:22.226 --> 00:21:26.369]  Then you need to get Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:21:26.369 --> 00:21:31.033]  You need to get my new film, Martial Law, to see cops and military taking video of us at the RNC.
[00:21:32.446 --> 00:21:35.287]  And then I got video of it from Alabama to Texas.
[00:21:35.287 --> 00:21:36.248]  Just troops!
[00:21:36.248 --> 00:21:38.209]  And that's five minutes of the film!
[00:21:38.209 --> 00:21:39.629]  On a three hour mini-series.
[00:21:39.629 --> 00:21:42.011]  Martial Law is three one hour films in one.
[00:21:42.011 --> 00:21:46.092]  It's Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[00:21:46.092 --> 00:21:49.374]  There's my new film, The Order of Death, about what these weirdos do in their off hours.
[00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:55.137]  These Christian conservative leaders run around involved in bizarre cult activities.
[00:21:55.137 --> 00:21:57.638]  Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut couldn't hold a candle to this.
[00:21:59.202 --> 00:22:07.606]  And when you get the new film Order of Death, you get absolutely free the re-edited, remastered, updated Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grub on the same DVD or same VHS.
[00:22:07.606 --> 00:22:11.508]  If you order today, we are shipping stuff out the same day it comes in now.
[00:22:11.508 --> 00:22:18.571]  If you order today, it's UPS Ground, a good chance you'll get it before Christmas.
[00:22:18.571 --> 00:22:25.475]  And if you want to give it as a gift, just go give us the address of where you want the videos and books you order off InfoWars.com.
[00:22:27.386 --> 00:22:32.030]  Just put the address properly in the form and tell us who you want to send it to.
[00:22:34.787 --> 00:22:41.071]  If you put a comment in the comment section, we can send that comment to that friend or family member with the box.
[00:22:41.071 --> 00:22:42.231]  You can say, here's your gift.
[00:22:42.231 --> 00:22:47.934]  If you order it today, it might get to them the day before Christmas, it might get to them the day after Christmas, I don't know.
[00:22:47.934 --> 00:22:50.116]  But it's a great gift to give.
[00:22:50.116 --> 00:22:54.538]  Or just order a bunch for yourself, and then give them as gifts when you get them.
[00:22:54.538 --> 00:22:58.040]  It is so important, and the specials we're offering just go to the first of the year.
[00:22:58.689 --> 00:23:02.032]  We're talking, in some cases, 75 plus percent off.
[00:23:02.032 --> 00:23:03.653]  T-shirts are normally $20, $9.95.
[00:23:03.653 --> 00:23:06.436]  DVDs are normally $24.95, $5.95.
[00:23:06.436 --> 00:23:12.541]  I mean, that's the type of specials we're talking about.
[00:23:12.541 --> 00:23:20.147]  Almost a half a year free, five plus months free on yearly subscriptions to PrisonPlanet.tv when you get them.
[00:23:20.936 --> 00:23:43.099]  So be sure and go to PrisonPlanet.tv and take advantage of that yearly subscription special where you get almost six months free when you get a yearly subscription or get a trial one month subscription for $5.95 but that's 15 cents a day or 19 cents a day and then if you get if you get the one year free what is it about 10 cents a day or less I mean come on a cup of coffee it's like a dollar fifty now
[00:23:43.739 --> 00:23:51.282]  And all my films, my book, Paul Watson's work, all my TV reports, all my best audio interviews, PrisonPlanet.tv, best deal on the web.
[00:23:52.743 --> 00:24:02.251]  Going back to Wayne Madsen, Wayne, I was talking to you during the break, of course you formerly worked there with the NSA, about what you thought was most important, and you mentioned a few of those.
[00:24:02.251 --> 00:24:06.555]  You mentioned the 10,000 enemies list.
[00:24:06.555 --> 00:24:10.458]  We have the no-fly list now of hundreds of thousands, and now we're going to have a criminal list.
[00:24:10.458 --> 00:24:12.019]  Go over that for us, please.
[00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:18.144]  Well, it's being reported, and I heard this before, that the White House has an enemies list.
[00:24:18.144 --> 00:24:19.325]  Now, Nixon had one, but he
[00:24:19.827 --> 00:24:24.953]  But he never really went after anybody on it, except for maybe a few people.
[00:24:24.953 --> 00:24:30.059]  But it certainly wasn't in excess of probably a hundred or so people.
[00:24:30.059 --> 00:24:31.421]  It was found to be illegal.
[00:24:31.421 --> 00:24:33.523]  Yeah, and it was illegal.
[00:24:33.523 --> 00:24:36.547]  And this list is said to contain the names of 10,000 people, including
[00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:38.841]  I don't think so.
[00:25:00.232 --> 00:25:05.739]  Yeah, I mean, so the problem is where do they get the information to populate this database?
[00:25:05.739 --> 00:25:15.591]  Apparently this was started by Rove when he was in Texas politics, but now it's been added to by FBI agents using these national security letters to go get information from
[00:25:15.991 --> 00:25:18.472]  Phone companies, credit card companies.
[00:25:18.472 --> 00:25:22.873]  And of course these FBI files are famous for being full of complete baloney.
[00:25:22.873 --> 00:25:36.356]  Oh absolutely, because it's raw information and people when they're confronted by one of these agents tend to freeze up and say things that may or may not be true or at least exaggerate.
[00:25:36.356 --> 00:25:38.736]  It's like what happened during the McCarthy era.
[00:25:38.736 --> 00:25:41.997]  So yeah, this is the nature of this beast.
[00:25:43.038 --> 00:25:50.878]  But I do know that people in the Pentagon and in the NSA and in the CIA, the ones that do the work, not the high up
[00:25:53.170 --> 00:26:15.255]  Um, political types, uh, are getting very concerned about what's happened, because understand that they grew up in the environment of post-Watergate, with all the controls and restraints that were put on these agencies, and they knew they could go to jail if they violated these laws, and now they see this administration... Well, they've also got to be looking, uh, because it's one thing to be dumbed-down, American, six-pack, you know, Sally Soccer Mom, wants to be stupid.
[00:26:15.855 --> 00:26:22.697]  And even a lot of people who've been neo-conish, who I've talked to in government, are now actually getting to see what the final plan is.
[00:26:22.697 --> 00:26:23.938]  It really is FEMA camps.
[00:26:23.938 --> 00:26:25.418]  It really is martial law.
[00:26:25.418 --> 00:26:26.659]  It really is dictatorship.
[00:26:26.659 --> 00:26:31.060]  I mean, I had Bob Barr on a week ago, a little over, and he actually said, well, could we have martial law?
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.641]  And he said, yeah, I think a dictatorship's a real danger.
[00:26:33.641 --> 00:26:37.382]  I mean, when Bob Barr's talking like that, Wayne, it's not very hard.
[00:26:37.382 --> 00:26:38.822]  I mean, it's getting pretty obvious.
[00:26:38.822 --> 00:26:39.543]  Well, that's right.
[00:26:39.543 --> 00:26:43.924]  And I mean, Barr used to work at the CIA, so he knows about the laws and what
[00:26:46.145 --> 00:26:52.186]  I mean, I agree with that.
[00:26:52.186 --> 00:27:03.609]  And then we see how people retaliated against, like this NSA analyst who had been a White House Secret Service agent who protected, was willing to take a bullet for Bill Clinton and George W. Bush
[00:27:04.028 --> 00:27:21.443]  Went to the NSA, and then he's been set up in his phony, as they say, he took two boxes of classified material home in broad daylight out of the most heavily guarded complex in the world, the National Security Agency at Fort Meade, Maryland.
[00:27:21.443 --> 00:27:28.289]  The reason he did this to him is that he authored an intelligence report that said there were no WMDs in Iraq.
[00:27:28.289 --> 00:27:29.570]  His name was on it when it reached
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.362]  That Dick Cheney's office.
[00:27:33.362 --> 00:27:38.006]  And you know, Dick Cheney is starting to look more and more like Dr. Evil in this whole thing.
[00:27:38.006 --> 00:27:57.680]  Well, but what about the Army colonel who was in military intelligence who saw clearly that they had been blocked from stopping Al-Cieda, and so he releases this, and now they go, well, you had $65 in phone calls on your government phone to your wife, and we're going to charge you with theft.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.981]  And it actually was in the newspaper.
[00:27:59.281 --> 00:28:00.121]  We're good to go.
[00:28:22.116 --> 00:28:44.010]  Coalition, and they're putting all their notes together and there's going to be heck to pay for the Bush administration next year when these people start to show up at these political campaign rallies and talk about how they were fighting the war on terrorism and what happened to them when they refused to lie for this administration.
[00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.712]  And I think it's going to be devastating.
[00:28:47.410 --> 00:29:03.179]  Well, that is good news that the White House, that the Vice President's Office with Puder Libby, that, and that's what his nickname for him, they all have a feces name, that's how sick he is, that Puder Libby, that they have to manufacture it themselves.
[00:29:03.179 --> 00:29:03.759]  Well, that's it.
[00:29:06.299 --> 00:29:08.401]  Particularly the Cheney office.
[00:29:08.401 --> 00:29:15.305]  Now, Cheney's office also was the scene of a Filipino espionage ring, which has conveniently dropped off the radar screen.
[00:29:15.305 --> 00:29:15.785]  That's right.
[00:29:15.785 --> 00:29:21.408]  Israeli, German, Filipino, any type of real espionage is just fine.
[00:29:21.408 --> 00:29:26.171]  It's just wonderful, but oh, you called your wife with your government phone.
[00:29:26.171 --> 00:29:27.492]  That's right, that's right.
[00:29:27.492 --> 00:29:29.113]  This was obviously an attempt to get
[00:29:29.793 --> 00:29:31.014]  Well, speaking of
[00:29:53.027 --> 00:29:53.427]  We're good to go.
[00:30:10.468 --> 00:30:15.031]  I mean, just to get the word out, you're like a movie.
[00:30:15.031 --> 00:30:16.932]  That's how obvious this is, Wayne.
[00:30:16.932 --> 00:30:31.282]  Well, yeah, and you know, the whole false flag operations, what they call these, you know, I still have a lot of questions about the arson in France, the London underground attacks, the bombings there.
[00:30:31.901 --> 00:30:36.624]  Um, there are people who engage in these false flag activities.
[00:30:36.624 --> 00:30:38.185]  Well, no, I mean, they'll get something started.
[00:30:38.185 --> 00:30:46.149]  Well, I mean, we caught British intelligence, I mean, that's what SAS is, Special Air Service, dressed up like Arabs, running around shooting people with bombs.
[00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.730]  Well, that's right.
[00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:51.433]  And God knows who's behind some of these terrorist attacks in Iraq.
[00:30:51.433 --> 00:30:55.035]  Three separate times they've caught Israelis dressed up, shooting at Marines.
[00:30:55.035 --> 00:31:00.139]  The Marines catch them, beat them up, kill them sometimes, and then are ordered to release them.
[00:31:00.139 --> 00:31:03.181]  Now, why, Wayne, would they have Israeli units going around killing our own troops?
[00:31:03.181 --> 00:31:05.463]  Well, does our government make more money over there?
[00:31:05.463 --> 00:31:07.404]  Were there a year or were there ten?
[00:31:07.404 --> 00:31:08.385]  Well, that's it.
[00:31:08.385 --> 00:31:14.529]  I mean, and then we've got these private military contractors in Iraq that are ex-mercenaries from South Africa.
[00:31:15.376 --> 00:31:24.172]  Uh, Pinochet's people in Chile, Contra's out of Nicaragua, Iraq is now... They talk about all the jihadists going to Iraq, but the United States has engineered...
[00:31:24.525 --> 00:31:31.849]  The worst filth in the world are now working in Iraq, supposedly for this Iraqi puppet regime.
[00:31:31.849 --> 00:31:41.354]  Well, we've gone from one Iraqi puppet regime, where Christians and Jews were left alone, to one where they're going to have the jihadist Shiites running the entire country.
[00:31:41.354 --> 00:31:43.515]  That's right, that's right.
[00:31:43.515 --> 00:31:47.017]  Basically, Iraq will become a province of Iran.
[00:31:47.017 --> 00:31:49.618]  Some people call it Western Iran.
[00:31:49.618 --> 00:31:52.180]  And that's what this crowd of neocons has done.
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:52.980]  Now they want to nuke
[00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:55.774]  Iran and going to Syria.
[00:31:55.774 --> 00:31:58.816]  These people basically are insane.
[00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:06.300]  They're just like the Nazis in Germany or the fascists that wanted to recreate the Roman Empire under Mussolini.
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.962]  These people, they belong in a prison.
[00:32:09.962 --> 00:32:11.122]  They belong in the Hague.
[00:32:11.122 --> 00:32:14.504]  They should be on trial with Milosevic and others.
[00:32:14.504 --> 00:32:15.605]  Here's the problem.
[00:32:17.357 --> 00:32:19.600]  I mean, I hope that their system's just falling apart.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.984]  Bush giving three press conferences in three days.
[00:32:21.984 --> 00:32:25.069]  He doesn't usually give about five a year.
[00:32:25.069 --> 00:32:26.611]  But I'm a little confused here.
[00:32:26.611 --> 00:32:30.397]  I mean, it looks to me like what I'm getting is that they're going to let the Patriot Act expire.
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:54.091]  We're going to have a government terror attack, false flag attack, then they're going to say, see, it's you guys, you peaceniks, you caused the terrorists to attack, and I've heard Michael Savage saying this, and then we're going to be arrested because we aided the terrorists getting the law changed, and in Australia they're trying to pass a law to criticize the military and its actions, you get seven years in prison.
[00:32:54.091 --> 00:32:58.333]  I mean, I really see them going to that, because if they carry out an attack now, people will say, oh look, you couldn't protect us.
[00:32:58.573 --> 00:33:01.475]  But if they, quote, lose the Patriot Act, then they'll have that.
[00:33:01.475 --> 00:33:02.976]  I mean, do you see him setting that up, Wayne?
[00:33:02.976 --> 00:33:05.157]  Well, look, I don't put anything past these people.
[00:33:05.157 --> 00:33:06.118]  They're insane.
[00:33:06.118 --> 00:33:16.304]  Any administration who would out not only a covert CIA agent, but her entire network that was trying to stop the flow of WMDs, and including an attempt to salt
[00:33:16.904 --> 00:33:20.827]  uh... uh... vx nerve gas into iraq from uh... u.s.
[00:33:20.827 --> 00:33:45.847]  controlled kurdistan uh... before the war uh... it definitely tells me that they did that's what how far they're they they would go and i want to play this at them on what is what you want to play out play the uh... green skin puppet plays go ahead there's a process that goes on inside the justice department and uh... i presume about leaks i presume that process is moving forward
[00:33:48.197 --> 00:33:57.564]  My personal opinion is it was a shameful act for someone to disclose this very important program in time of war.
[00:33:57.564 --> 00:34:00.647]  You're shameful!
[00:34:00.647 --> 00:34:05.730]  The fact that we're discussing this program is helping the enemy.
[00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:06.871]  Oh, you, the criminal?
[00:34:06.871 --> 00:34:14.517]  You've got to understand, and I hope the American people understand, there is still an enemy that would like to strike the United States of America.
[00:34:14.517 --> 00:34:16.198]  We know you are very dangerous.
[00:34:16.198 --> 00:34:16.959]  You are very dangerous.
[00:34:18.018 --> 00:34:32.467]  And, you know, the discussion about how we try to find them will enable them to adjust.
[00:34:32.467 --> 00:34:39.572]  Now, I can understand you asking these questions, and if I were you, I'd be asking me these questions too.
[00:34:39.572 --> 00:34:41.253]  But it is a shameful act.
[00:34:42.958 --> 00:34:49.223]  By somebody who has got secrets of the United States government and feels like they need to disclose them publicly.
[00:34:49.223 --> 00:34:53.646]  Okay, let's just stop right there and let's just think about what we just heard.
[00:34:53.646 --> 00:34:56.889]  This is the individual that said he wasn't looking for Bin Laden and didn't want him.
[00:34:56.889 --> 00:35:00.572]  Buzzy Krongar, number three at CIA, said we don't want him.
[00:35:00.572 --> 00:35:05.456]  Okay, any time special forces have cornered a real Taliban or Al-Qaeda, they're told to back off.
[00:35:05.456 --> 00:35:10.059]  When they capture them, top generals fly in and order them released, because they're government ops, folks.
[00:35:10.059 --> 00:35:11.060]  Okay, this is confirmed.
[00:35:11.644 --> 00:35:13.105]  This is confirmed.
[00:35:13.105 --> 00:35:16.008]  And then he talks about a shameful act giving out intelligence.
[00:35:16.008 --> 00:35:19.992]  It's Bush that really gives out real intelligence, burning whole European networks.
[00:35:19.992 --> 00:35:20.672]  Right, Wayne?
[00:35:20.672 --> 00:35:21.173]  That's right.
[00:35:21.173 --> 00:35:27.038]  And everything he said, if you apply that to the people who leaked Mallory Plain Wilson and her Brewster Jennings
[00:35:27.463 --> 00:35:27.623]  Yes.
[00:35:42.117 --> 00:35:44.478]  Involved in all this traffic and this intelligence?
[00:35:44.478 --> 00:35:53.964]  As if Al-Qaeda, if it really existed outside of the military-industrial complex backroom creations of the seventies and eighties, as if they don't know that phones aren't listened to.
[00:35:53.964 --> 00:35:56.705]  They're not naive like the general American public.
[00:35:56.705 --> 00:36:10.153]  Well, let me tell you, Bin Laden was talking on his satellite phone up until 1996, and I'll tell you why he stopped, because the Chechen president, Dzhokhar Dudayev, was hit by a missile while he was on his satellite phone to
[00:36:10.533 --> 00:36:11.654]  Thank you for your time.
[00:36:30.003 --> 00:36:32.344]  Yeah, they're using what Benjamin Franklin used.
[00:36:32.344 --> 00:36:33.725]  Yeah, right, exactly.
[00:36:33.725 --> 00:36:35.446]  And Tom Jefferson and the rest, yeah.
[00:36:35.446 --> 00:36:37.227]  You ever seen his cipher?
[00:36:37.227 --> 00:36:38.288]  That's right, that's right.
[00:36:38.288 --> 00:36:47.833]  And this is what they, the so-called Al-Qaeda, I mean, I'm not sure they were using official channels to communicate courtesy of
[00:36:48.733 --> 00:36:53.258]  I'm afraid the next one's going to be this biological thing.
[00:36:53.258 --> 00:36:55.259]  I think, you know, we hear Bush talking about bird flu all the time.
[00:36:55.259 --> 00:36:55.660]  Of course,
[00:37:05.785 --> 00:37:21.613]  You know, here's a person with a bird brain talking about avian flu, but see, this will give them a chance to do the quarantine, and the martial law, and close the borders, and that's what I'm... How many people live in the United States?
[00:37:21.613 --> 00:37:28.436]  Bush and others in his drug addict ilk, you know, are kind of cunning like a rat, but they do have really smart people around them.
[00:37:28.436 --> 00:37:31.558]  Don't they know every time in history somebody does this, they end up getting caught?
[00:37:32.412 --> 00:37:33.913]  Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:37:33.913 --> 00:37:35.255]  I'm not sure they know that.
[00:37:35.255 --> 00:37:45.924]  I think these people are fanatics and are radicals and I'm not sure they really... I mean, look, Hitler should have known about what happened with Napoleon.
[00:37:45.924 --> 00:37:46.845]  They always go there.
[00:37:46.845 --> 00:37:48.446]  They always go back.
[00:37:48.446 --> 00:37:50.028]  They refuse to learn from history.
[00:37:50.028 --> 00:37:57.555]  And I think this crowd of neocons whose ideological forebears were these
[00:37:58.335 --> 00:38:01.498]  People who really were fascists.
[00:38:01.498 --> 00:38:04.600]  I mean, they practiced fascism.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:08.603]  Jabotinsky and... And Straussian!
[00:38:08.603 --> 00:38:09.563]  Straussian, right.
[00:38:09.563 --> 00:38:10.624]  Leo Strauss.
[00:38:10.624 --> 00:38:12.906]  These are their political godfathers.
[00:38:14.033 --> 00:38:14.794]  All right, stay there Wayne.
[00:38:14.794 --> 00:38:16.835]  I want to just keep you for the full transmission.
[00:38:16.835 --> 00:38:17.715]  Five more minutes.
[00:38:17.715 --> 00:38:19.036]  Go to Ray and Michael.
[00:38:19.036 --> 00:38:21.998]  That's all we'll have time to take is those two final calls.
[00:38:21.998 --> 00:38:25.019]  On the other side for Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com.
[00:38:25.019 --> 00:38:27.981]  You'll find me at InfoWars.com and InfoWars.net.
[00:38:27.981 --> 00:38:29.882]  Check them out today in the InfoWars.
[00:38:29.882 --> 00:38:37.147]  We don't need no education.
[00:38:43.443 --> 00:38:51.146]  Monday through Friday, from 11 to 2 central.
[00:38:51.146 --> 00:38:52.127]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[00:38:52.127 --> 00:38:53.688]  We're here, tell them like it is.
[00:38:53.688 --> 00:38:55.268]  What did we say 5 years ago?
[00:38:55.268 --> 00:38:56.509]  What did we say 10 years ago?
[00:38:56.509 --> 00:39:01.131]  A lot of you have been listening for 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 years.
[00:39:01.131 --> 00:39:02.732]  We're not that smart either.
[00:39:02.732 --> 00:39:06.634]  We're just going off history and the facts and what's happening.
[00:39:06.634 --> 00:39:09.015]  Wayne Manson, I tell ya,
[00:39:10.522 --> 00:39:11.683]  I hope it's not biological.
[00:39:11.683 --> 00:39:12.784]  I think that's a real threat.
[00:39:12.784 --> 00:39:14.146]  All of this is a real threat.
[00:39:14.146 --> 00:39:19.992]  We know that certain strategic elites let Bush get into power, is letting him do a lot of this.
[00:39:19.992 --> 00:39:21.954]  Do you think they're going to let him go all the way?
[00:39:21.954 --> 00:39:26.378]  Or do you think Bush and his cronies have gone rogue?
[00:39:26.378 --> 00:39:32.465]  Because I know some of the European elite, because we've had moles inside some of their meetings, are saying that the agenda is moving too fast.
[00:39:34.027 --> 00:39:36.830]  I mean, where do you see all this going?
[00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:44.418]  You see what happened with Brent Scowcroft, who was put on by Bush's daddy there to keep an eye on him on the farm.
[00:39:46.223 --> 00:39:51.124]  President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, and then Bush fired him after he got re-elected.
[00:39:51.124 --> 00:39:57.165]  So the old man lost his eyes and ears inside the intelligence structure.
[00:39:57.165 --> 00:40:01.646]  And Scowcroft came out and said, look, this isn't the same Dick Cheney that I remember.
[00:40:01.646 --> 00:40:03.427]  It's like he's a new person.
[00:40:03.427 --> 00:40:08.868]  You wonder whether Cheney's been blackmailed by some foreign power or foreign group.
[00:40:08.868 --> 00:40:15.369]  My suspicion is it's the Russian-Israeli mafia, what they call the Red Mafia.
[00:40:16.209 --> 00:40:19.590]  Through Mark Rich and Scooter Libby was Mark Rich's attorney.
[00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:20.691]  I think that's where it goes.
[00:40:20.691 --> 00:40:25.212]  I think that's why we're seeing everything happen in this administration.
[00:40:25.212 --> 00:40:26.813]  Well, the same thing went on with Clinton.
[00:40:26.813 --> 00:40:29.393]  I mean, they know what girls are, you know.
[00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:37.016]  Oh, you know, the Lewinsky thing and all the other... Denise Rich, who was Mark Rich's ex, was having an affair with Clinton.
[00:40:37.016 --> 00:40:39.356]  I think they know where all the buttons are to push.
[00:40:39.356 --> 00:40:40.897]  With Clinton, obviously, it's sex.
[00:40:40.897 --> 00:40:43.818]  With this push, it's... I don't know what his interests are.
[00:40:44.358 --> 00:40:51.721]  Sometimes I wonder if it's money, then he's got enough of that, and then you see Jeff Gannon parading around the White House press room.
[00:40:51.721 --> 00:40:55.022]  Well, we know what they like at Bohemian Grove.
[00:40:55.022 --> 00:41:01.104]  You wonder whether Bush's interests don't go totally opposite from what Bill Clinton's were.
[00:41:01.104 --> 00:41:02.945]  Yeah, well, we know what they are.
[00:41:02.945 --> 00:41:06.666]  He likes both snails and oysters, as they say in Spartacus.
[00:41:06.666 --> 00:41:08.487]  Let's talk to Ray in Delaware.
[00:41:08.487 --> 00:41:09.387]  Ray, you're on the air.
[00:41:09.387 --> 00:41:10.047]  Go ahead.
[00:41:10.047 --> 00:41:10.747]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[00:41:10.747 --> 00:41:12.408]  You know, my specialty is the media.
[00:41:12.935 --> 00:41:22.059]  People should be outraged about this story this weekend that the New York Times held this story for a year at the request of the administration.
[00:41:22.059 --> 00:41:26.302]  That's shameful censorship of the press.
[00:41:26.302 --> 00:41:28.423]  That's real, real dangerous stuff.
[00:41:28.423 --> 00:41:30.984]  Yeah, we have them running around telling the press what they can and can't say.
[00:41:30.984 --> 00:41:32.364]  It has nothing to do with leaks.
[00:41:32.364 --> 00:41:34.646]  They're persecuting people that didn't play ball.
[00:41:34.646 --> 00:41:39.428]  Yeah, and they're absolutely using a propaganda campaign saying that the press
[00:41:40.051 --> 00:41:43.695]  By releasing these stories is aiding the enemy.
[00:41:43.695 --> 00:41:48.581]  Why isn't that little CNN twit, Novak in jail, Wayne?
[00:41:48.581 --> 00:41:50.704]  Well, yeah, good question.
[00:41:50.704 --> 00:41:54.108]  Now Novak came out and said, look, Bush knows who the leaker was.
[00:41:54.108 --> 00:41:57.392]  Yeah, well, that's good.
[00:41:57.392 --> 00:41:59.695]  Why doesn't Bush tell us who it is?
[00:42:00.103 --> 00:42:03.686]  And if Novak knows who it is, why is he sitting on the information?
[00:42:03.686 --> 00:42:04.607]  He says he's a journalist.
[00:42:04.607 --> 00:42:12.413]  You know, the other day Jack Anderson passed away, and we really lost a guy who took over the old Drew Pearson column.
[00:42:12.413 --> 00:42:15.375]  These were the guys that would have not sat on stuff.
[00:42:15.375 --> 00:42:18.998]  The minute they got it confirmed, it would have been out on their syndicated column.
[00:42:18.998 --> 00:42:19.858]  Out of time, Ray.
[00:42:19.858 --> 00:42:20.419]  Great point.
[00:42:20.419 --> 00:42:21.740]  Michael in Michigan, quickly.
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.381]  Final comments from Wayne Manson.
[00:42:23.381 --> 00:42:24.362]  Yes, hi Alex.
[00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:29.347]  I was wondering, your guest had mentioned a list of 10,000 the government has.
[00:42:29.347 --> 00:42:30.729]  I'm just wondering if I'm on the list.
[00:42:30.729 --> 00:42:34.493]  Have you heard anything about gang stalking?
[00:42:34.493 --> 00:42:37.456]  Yeah, you know, I really don't get into all that.
[00:42:37.456 --> 00:42:42.221]  I've heard about that, but it just kind of goes into a whole category that I can't confirm, so I don't cover it.
[00:42:42.221 --> 00:42:43.362]  Wayne, have you heard of that?
[00:42:43.362 --> 00:42:45.304]  No, I haven't.
[00:42:45.304 --> 00:42:46.666]  Alright, anything else there, Mike?
[00:42:48.362 --> 00:42:49.642]  All right, we're out of time.
[00:42:49.642 --> 00:42:50.523]  I'm sorry to the callers.
[00:42:50.523 --> 00:42:51.383]  We tried to get to a lot of you.
[00:42:51.383 --> 00:42:52.503]  We had two great guests on today.
[00:42:52.503 --> 00:42:54.363]  Wayne, I want to get you up on a monthly basis.
[00:42:54.363 --> 00:42:56.904]  We really always appreciate you spending time with us.
[00:42:56.904 --> 00:42:59.785]  As soon as that new book comes out, I want to carry it, okay?
[00:42:59.785 --> 00:43:01.125]  Okay, that's good April.
[00:43:01.125 --> 00:43:02.365]  Good to be with you.
[00:43:02.365 --> 00:43:02.925]  God bless you.
[00:43:02.925 --> 00:43:03.706]  Take care.
[00:43:03.706 --> 00:43:04.766]  I hope we're here in April.
[00:43:04.766 --> 00:43:06.786]  All right, we'll see you.
[00:43:06.786 --> 00:43:08.267]  All right, folks.
[00:43:08.267 --> 00:43:09.087]  God bless you all.
[00:43:09.087 --> 00:43:10.467]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
[00:43:10.467 --> 00:43:12.908]  We can beat these people.
