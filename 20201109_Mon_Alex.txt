[00:00:07.176 --> 00:00:09.377]  It's Monday, November 9th.
[00:00:09.377 --> 00:00:10.357]  The year is 2020.
[00:00:10.357 --> 00:00:12.338]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:12.338 --> 00:00:20.101]  And I have the exact globalist battle plan to throw Trump out of office and overthrow the Republic and put us on permanent lockdown.
[00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:22.962]  I also know how to stop them.
[00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:24.783]  And we've proven that we know what we're talking about here.
[00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:27.944]  I'm going to lay it all out at the start of the next segment.
[00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:32.186]  What I need you to do is to take action now and spread the word about this broadcast.
[00:00:33.643 --> 00:00:46.590]  The fourth estate really did a number on this country, churning out useful idiots with a steady stream of brainwashing, covering up the most heinous act of massive election fraud ever waged on the United States.
[00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:55.154]  I've been thinking about how difficult this year has been for so many Americans, and it hasn't been felt evenly in this country.
[00:00:55.154 --> 00:01:02.598]  There are millions of Americans who were disproportionately hurt by this president's failure to deal with
[00:01:03.358 --> 00:01:04.919]  This coronavirus crisis.
[00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:07.361]  They were devastated economically.
[00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:14.945]  They were dying at disproportionate rates, getting disease and sickness at disproportionate rates.
[00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:18.988]  And I do think that they voted in their interest.
[00:01:18.988 --> 00:01:20.809]  They voted for their lives.
[00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:45.299]  Ricari, as I was watching earlier, listening to the President of the United States talking about these cities that are, that have big black populations, calling them fraudulent and the process fraudulent and that they're trying to steal it from them, I thought it was an insult to the people whose ancestors, even many of them died for the right to vote just because they're showing up to the polls does not make it fraudulent.
[00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.179]  That was an insult to me.
[00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.194]  I do think at the same time we should all recognize that there is election denialism going on.
[00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:55.638]  There are crazy conspiracy theories out there being read by millions of people.
[00:01:55.638 --> 00:01:59.662]  Tens of millions of people are seeing this stuff on Fox News about voter fraud.
[00:01:59.662 --> 00:02:00.943]  And it is real.
[00:02:00.943 --> 00:02:02.765]  And election denialism is real.
[00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:03.866]  And it has to be called out.
[00:02:04.406 --> 00:02:06.628]  Although I understand why the Biden campaign is trying to move past it.
[00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:41.852]  Regardless of the evidence, the sycophantic morons were overjoyed with stupidity to call the election for Joe Biden.
[00:02:41.852 --> 00:02:45.255]  It's also just a lesson for people out there watching.
[00:02:45.255 --> 00:02:45.976]  Don't give up.
[00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:47.778]  Don't give up if you believe in yourself.
[00:02:47.778 --> 00:02:53.082]  You can actually achieve what you want to achieve, despite all odds.
[00:02:53.082 --> 00:02:54.103]  It's an incredible moment.
[00:02:54.103 --> 00:03:00.829]  His path to victory has been long, arduous, and painful, and decades long, by the way.
[00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:18.044]  I would like to note that if they are confused by the honking going on behind you, that is a mark of the new COVID era, where Joe Biden would have drive-in rallies and instead of applauding and cheering, people would honk.
[00:03:18.772 --> 00:03:19.312]  Right.
[00:03:19.312 --> 00:03:22.033]  And they just can't contain themselves.
[00:03:22.033 --> 00:03:27.034]  On one hand, self-righteously condemning Trump for his tweets and bully pulpit.
[00:03:27.034 --> 00:03:35.397]  Philadelphia, a city that Donald Trump has been attacking unfairly for a long time.
[00:03:35.397 --> 00:03:41.359]  He even got into a fight with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018 after the Eagles won the Super Bowl.
[00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.840]  And on the other, bullying Trump and his supporters with insults and threats.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.862]  A concession is not necessary under the U.S.
[00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:49.242]  Constitution.
[00:03:49.242 --> 00:03:50.644]  That's what I mean, it doesn't make it any less real.
[00:03:50.644 --> 00:03:52.305]  It's not necessary.
[00:03:52.305 --> 00:04:06.957]  Whether or not Donald Trump acts like an adult, if Joe Biden becomes the next president, Joe Biden will become the next president and Donald Trump will be, if it comes down to it, physically escorted from the building.
[00:04:06.957 --> 00:04:14.643]  While Minority Senate Leader Chuck Schumer already had his claws out after the announcement to tear America to shreds.
[00:04:15.728 --> 00:04:24.335]  Now we take Georgia, and then we change the world!
[00:04:24.335 --> 00:04:28.178]  Now we take Georgia, and then we change America!
[00:04:28.178 --> 00:04:33.522]  Will these mindless sycophants still be gloating if the election is possibly turned over?
[00:04:33.522 --> 00:04:44.331]  And furthermore, if Joe Biden gets away with his deception, will they still support Joe Biden after he turns the country over to the globalist hellscape on the horizon?
[00:04:44.331 --> 00:04:45.492]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:04:58.366 --> 00:04:59.406]  DNA Force Plus.
[00:04:59.406 --> 00:05:03.688]  If you did one thing for your immune system, it would be get all the essential things.
[00:05:03.688 --> 00:05:06.030]  And that's the clean iodine, X2 or X3.
[00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.650]  That's the biotrichoselenium.
[00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.171]  That is the vitamin D3.
[00:05:09.171 --> 00:05:11.032]  That is the C. That is the zinc.
[00:05:11.032 --> 00:05:12.673]  There's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential.
[00:05:12.673 --> 00:05:13.273]  Without them, you die.
[00:05:13.273 --> 00:05:14.734]  And studies show you really need the other ones, too.
[00:05:15.034 --> 00:05:16.335]  But DNA Force goes beyond that.
[00:05:16.335 --> 00:05:27.882]  It helps get all that in the cells and out the cells with PQQ and CoQ10 of the highest quality sources with other ingredients that clean out the cells, that unclog them so all that stuff can get in.
[00:05:27.882 --> 00:05:28.943]  Viruses don't get in.
[00:05:28.943 --> 00:05:29.983]  The good stuff gets in.
[00:05:29.983 --> 00:05:34.006]  As the NIH website says, if you have all the proper things, they can't replicate like they could.
[00:05:34.306 --> 00:05:35.667]  I do this because it's essential.
[00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:36.727]  Like oxygen, like water.
[00:05:36.727 --> 00:05:38.869]  DNA Force sold out for months.
[00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:40.029]  50% off out of the gates.
[00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:41.070]  Triple Patriot Points.
[00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.930]  Free shipping.

[00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:44.832]  DNA Force Election Special.
[00:05:44.832 --> 00:05:45.792]  That's going to have to end in a week.
[00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:48.654]  We've got a limited supply and it was very hard to get the PQQ this time.
[00:05:48.654 --> 00:05:50.155]  A lot of our stuff can't get anymore.
[00:05:50.155 --> 00:05:52.196]  A lot of our products because the supply chain's broken down.
[00:05:52.196 --> 00:05:53.256]  That's part of the Global's plan.
[00:05:53.256 --> 00:05:55.097]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:55.097 --> 00:05:56.318]  I want to thank you all for tuning in.
[00:06:02.015 --> 00:06:03.718]  Big Brother.
[00:06:03.718 --> 00:06:06.041]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:07.844]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:07.844 --> 00:06:09.907]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:09.907 --> 00:06:12.070]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.637]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:19.403 --> 00:06:22.724]  So the top general, the chairman of their Joint Chiefs of Staff came out over the weekend.
[00:06:22.724 --> 00:06:38.649]  He said the COVID-19 lockdown has already starved millions to death and it's going to trigger a new world war because the third world is totally collapsing and giant conflicts have exploded everywhere and the numbers of deaths from this is hundreds of times what COVID is already.
[00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:39.990]  We'll be covering that coming up.
[00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:48.773]  The UN came out a month ago and said there shouldn't be lockdown twos because it's going to cause massive starvation of hundreds of millions of people that are already on the edge of death.
[00:06:51.072 --> 00:06:51.672]  And what happened?
[00:06:51.672 --> 00:07:06.636]  They're expanding the lockdowns from Australia to the United Kingdom and Europe and now Biden is set to announce his own lockdown in the next 48 hours and demand Trump implement it or Trump's quote behind new COVID deaths.
[00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:10.797]  I'm going to explain the psychological warfare system and how to stop them.
[00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:19.800]  What I'm going to lay out here today is the heart and the key and the center to everything.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:19.900]  And
[00:07:20.888 --> 00:07:24.890]  The White House needs to listen to us.
[00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.070]  You need to listen to us.
[00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:31.793]  And folks need to take this information and put it in the bank.
[00:07:31.793 --> 00:07:44.659]  I'm going to lay out how I knew it was going to unfold years ago, how we specifically predicted each piece of this, not so we get a pat on the back, but so we can stop them.
[00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:50.082]  There is still a chance for Trump
[00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.531]  To win the election, fairly and squarely.
[00:07:55.531 --> 00:08:01.854]  But I was sitting in one of the offices this morning, about 12 feet away from a trash can.
[00:08:01.854 --> 00:08:02.874]  And I said, watch this.
[00:08:02.874 --> 00:08:11.037]  And I threw a little Gatorade container and banked it off the wall and a file cabinet and into the trash.
[00:08:11.037 --> 00:08:15.859]  And my point was, that's how Trump's got to get around this fraud and get around these people.
[00:08:15.859 --> 00:08:16.799]  There is an exact
[00:08:18.575 --> 00:08:20.456]  The path of truth and justice to defeat them.
[00:08:20.456 --> 00:08:23.198]  There is only one path.
[00:08:23.198 --> 00:08:26.300]  And it's a bank shot.
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:32.724]  And it is a easy path if executed exactly as I say.
[00:08:32.724 --> 00:08:36.426]  So call everyone you know, send it to your email list, your text messages.
[00:08:36.426 --> 00:08:38.067]  Call the White House.
[00:08:38.067 --> 00:08:41.569]  Go bullhorn the White House.
[00:08:41.569 --> 00:08:43.030]  Go bullhorn Mar-a-Lago.
[00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.591]  Trump's back and forth.
[00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:45.411]  The point is, is let
[00:08:47.165 --> 00:08:49.125]  Him know what's happening and what's unfolding.
[00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:57.167]  And I can tell you that I can sit there and I can get on the phone with folks very close to the President or the President if I need to.
[00:08:57.167 --> 00:08:59.887]  I don't have a day or two to sit there by the telephone.
[00:08:59.887 --> 00:09:02.488]  Many times they've called, I've missed the calls.
[00:09:02.488 --> 00:09:04.388]  I missed some of the calls already the last few days.
[00:09:04.388 --> 00:09:10.469]  I cannot sit by the telephone for a call from Trump.
[00:09:10.469 --> 00:09:13.470]  I cannot sit by the telephone to do this.
[00:09:14.557 --> 00:09:15.338]  It makes me sick.
[00:09:15.338 --> 00:09:17.480]  I take a nap or I'm on the air.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.260]  Boom.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.742]  I missed the phone call.
[00:09:19.742 --> 00:09:21.463]  I need you to get this out everywhere.
[00:09:21.463 --> 00:09:24.766]  And I need the activists to get this out everywhere.
[00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:27.680]  I need Don Jr.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.800]  and Eric and all of you to get this to your father.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.941]  So, I'm not playing games about this.
[00:09:31.941 --> 00:09:32.702]  Here's a special report.
[00:09:32.702 --> 00:09:35.182]  We're going to come back and break this all down the other side.
[00:09:35.182 --> 00:09:38.824]  It's on banned out videos from my film 13 years ago, Endgame.
[00:09:38.824 --> 00:09:42.725]  The visible Endgame on the horizon here is the John Bowne report.
[00:09:42.725 --> 00:09:44.766]  We'll be back with the biggest news I've ever reported.
[00:09:46.638 --> 00:09:51.881]  These dark builders intend to release a string of man-made bio-weapons plagues.
[00:09:51.881 --> 00:09:54.363]  Each one worse than the last.
[00:09:54.363 --> 00:10:00.986]  While at the same time expanding the police state to enforce an orderly extermination of the population.
[00:10:00.986 --> 00:10:06.430]  All in the name of fighting invisible terrorists.
[00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.671]  And the Georgia Guidestones stand today.
[00:10:09.298 --> 00:10:11.399]  Let me just state this right up front for everybody.
[00:10:40.165 --> 00:10:42.486]  People finally get it.
[00:10:42.486 --> 00:10:45.548]  We're having our free speech online disenfranchised.
[00:10:45.548 --> 00:10:48.229]  Now they're stealing our vote and disenfranchising it.
[00:10:48.229 --> 00:10:52.491]  They're devaluing our currency and disenfranchising our financial future.
[00:10:52.491 --> 00:10:57.734]  They are poisoning the weaker minds in the country with division and racism in the name of fighting it.
[00:10:57.734 --> 00:11:03.697]  They're attacking the very foundations of our republic and are at war with the social contract.
[00:11:03.697 --> 00:11:09.640]  An incredibly arrogant, hateful coalition of big tech vacuuming up the economy.
[00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:12.597]  At a level never before seen.
[00:11:12.597 --> 00:11:15.660]  People like at JCPenney and other retail, those jobs aren't coming back.
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.343]  Give them the tools, six months you're going to become a computer coder, we'll pay for it.
[00:11:19.343 --> 00:11:21.524]  And you'll get millions of people to sign up for that.
[00:11:21.524 --> 00:11:27.469]  They are not going back to parts of the retail economy, and we need to give them a lifeline to what's the next chapter.
[00:11:27.469 --> 00:11:29.551]  And then the commanders of big tech...
[00:11:30.478 --> 00:11:43.081]  And the big banks that finance them openly say they're building a post-human world and openly say they're going to make us so poor that they will be able to dictate that we be sterilized and take forced inoculations.
[00:11:43.081 --> 00:11:47.582]  You notice I just warned of this and warned of this for decades and now it's here.
[00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:51.644]  China is merely following the globalist blueprint for the world.
[00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:56.925]  The same system of total dehumanization is quietly being phased in worldwide.
[00:11:59.542 --> 00:12:04.443]  Depopulation should be the highest priority of foreign policy towards the third world.
[00:12:04.443 --> 00:12:05.364]  Henry Kissinger, 1974.
[00:12:05.364 --> 00:12:12.486]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:12:12.486 --> 00:12:15.447]  But it has different characteristics.
[00:12:15.447 --> 00:12:16.327]  In different parts.
[00:12:19.104 --> 00:12:19.464]  No.
[00:12:19.464 --> 00:12:25.131]  It's a lot bigger than just kicking Trump out and flooding everything with fake ballots using the lockdown as the cover for it.
[00:12:25.131 --> 00:12:32.198]  They want to bankrupt us and then have us have an app to be able to leave our front door and step one foot outside of our house.
[00:12:32.198 --> 00:12:35.282]  That is the admitted globalist chi-com plan.
[00:12:35.282 --> 00:12:37.284]  We're being given tracker systems.
[00:12:37.284 --> 00:12:38.725]  We're being taught to stay in our houses.
[00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:40.167]  We're being taught we're not essential.
[00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:40.627]  We're being
[00:12:41.653 --> 00:12:43.356]  Marinated in martial law.
[00:12:58.032 --> 00:12:58.332]  U.S.
[00:12:58.332 --> 00:13:01.955]  and British forces worked closely with Mao Zedong during World War II.
[00:13:01.955 --> 00:13:08.720]  And at the end of the war, they secretly backed Mao in driving out Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.384]  The OSS and then the CIA believed that Mao would have a stabilizing effect.
[00:13:14.384 --> 00:13:21.049]  And they're gonna hype up more that the police are racist to take the police over and turn them into political officers like they've done in the UK and Europe.
[00:13:21.309 --> 00:13:27.273]  Just because Biden is in office does not mean that our struggle is over!
[00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:30.955]  We challenge you to raise your fists in solidarity!
[00:13:42.563 --> 00:13:47.765]  Look at those around you who have not raised their fists.
[00:13:47.765 --> 00:13:49.165]  They are ignorant.
[00:13:49.165 --> 00:13:51.206]  They are complacent.
[00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:58.208]  They do not believe in a future where black people can prosper.
[00:13:58.208 --> 00:14:00.729]  They are just as racist.
[00:14:09.292 --> 00:14:12.797]  As police officers that are killing black people.
[00:14:12.797 --> 00:14:16.062]  As police officers that are killing black people.
[00:14:16.062 --> 00:14:20.349]  The arrogance level is so atrocious.
[00:14:20.349 --> 00:14:21.651]  It's so mega massive.
[00:14:23.251 --> 00:14:25.813]  That they're not even trying to hide it.
[00:14:25.813 --> 00:14:33.179]  I've never seen voting machines stop in the middle of an election, stop down and assess the situation.
[00:14:33.179 --> 00:14:39.705]  I also see reports that Nancy Pelosi's longtime chief of staff is a key executive at that company.
[00:14:39.705 --> 00:14:43.568]  Richard Blum, Senator Feinstein's husband, significant shareholder of the company.
[00:14:43.568 --> 00:14:48.132]  What can you tell us about the interest on the other side of this Dominion software?
[00:14:49.218 --> 00:14:56.367]  Well obviously they have invested in it for their own reasons and are using it to commit this fraud to steal votes.
[00:14:56.367 --> 00:15:02.254]  I think they've even stolen them from other Democrats in their own party who should be outraged about this also.
[00:15:02.254 --> 00:15:05.298]  Now we can see a new world coming into view.
[00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:11.118]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:16.085]  America is under multinational consortium attack.
[00:15:16.085 --> 00:15:19.490]  Our government and our system is in the process of being overthrown.
[00:15:20.635 --> 00:15:24.259]  It's not just a political party that wants an agenda.
[00:15:24.259 --> 00:15:27.942]  They want a whole new system and they've said it.
[00:15:27.942 --> 00:15:42.496]  They are involved in a revolution fully conquering the United States and killing our Republic and they're hammering the last nails into the damn coffin to bury us alive as slaves of their system.
[00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:52.016]  All right, I'm going to lay out Trump's path to victory and exactly what he's got to do and exactly what we've all got to do straight ahead.
[00:15:52.016 --> 00:15:53.217]  We are tomorrow's news today.
[00:15:53.217 --> 00:15:56.279]  I hope everybody listens up very carefully.
[00:15:56.279 --> 00:16:01.683]  For those drinking the globalist Kool-Aid, what I call the invincibly ignorant, there is no hope.
[00:16:01.683 --> 00:16:05.926]  But for those of you that care and are informed, we have more than hope.
[00:16:05.926 --> 00:16:10.270]  We have history on our side if we take action and if we spread the truth.
[00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.571]  I have been warning everyone.
[00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:15.275]  Of exactly what was going to come in the exact order.
[00:16:15.275 --> 00:16:16.216]  How did I do that?
[00:16:16.216 --> 00:16:21.782]  Because the globalists war game it all in public and prepare the public with brainwashing on MSN.
[00:16:21.782 --> 00:16:27.488]  When they put out the 80 million ballots, we knew it was so they could stuff it after the polls closed.
[00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:32.033]  That's why they got federal courts to rule to keep it open for weeks if need be.
[00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:33.134]  Again, it was so simple.
[00:16:33.795 --> 00:16:37.736]  And of course, you see the media heat up, saying Trump did a bad job on COVID.
[00:16:37.736 --> 00:16:45.978]  And that once Biden was, quote, President-elect, he would order Trump to admit that he did a bad job and admit that he needs a second lockdown.
[00:16:45.978 --> 00:16:52.219]  And if he doesn't go under Biden's immediate control and put that lockdown in place, he'll try to remove the President with the 25th Amendment.
[00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:55.560]  And all of that is to trick Trump to take the blame for COVID that's Chinese.
[00:16:56.638 --> 00:16:58.298]  Talk about tomorrow's news today.
[00:16:58.298 --> 00:17:02.099]  This is all very transparent when you war game it out.
[00:17:02.099 --> 00:17:07.760]  Six months ago, InfoWars predicted that the mail-in ballots would be used to steal the election from Trump.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:15.802]  They would simply pause the voting at night and then have an unlimited number that they had in reserve to bring forward in battleground states to secure the victory.
[00:17:15.802 --> 00:17:16.922]  And now that happened.
[00:17:16.922 --> 00:17:21.963]  Now, what else did I predict a few months ago and again last week and again last night, all on record?
[00:17:21.963 --> 00:17:24.064]  That when Joe Biden was president-elect,
[00:17:24.944 --> 00:17:25.605]  We're good to go.
[00:17:58.637 --> 00:18:01.266]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:18:07.442 --> 00:18:09.603]  I've been everywhere, man.
[00:18:09.603 --> 00:18:11.664]  I've been everywhere, man.
[00:18:11.664 --> 00:18:13.684]  Crossed the deserts bare, man.
[00:18:13.684 --> 00:18:15.805]  I've breathed the mountain air, man.
[00:18:15.805 --> 00:18:18.126]  I've traveled like I had my share, man.
[00:18:18.126 --> 00:18:20.927]  I've been everywhere.
[00:18:20.927 --> 00:18:32.811]  I've been to Reno, Chicago, Fargo, Minnesota, Buffalo, Toronto, Winslow, Sarasota, Wichita, Tulsa, Ottawa, Oklahoma... And everywhere I've been, I've seen the Democrats work with the deep state and sell out our country.
[00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:35.728]  Alex Jones here back live.
[00:18:35.728 --> 00:18:40.790]  So let me give you the big picture that I'm going to drill into it of what's about to unfold.
[00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:58.155]  Obviously, when the Democrats created 80 million mail-in ballots and mailed them out to all their people, they held them in reserve to see what they needed on election night to then freeze the election and then bring in the exact number they needed to handily defeat Trump, who had bigger leads in those battleground states than he had four years ago.
[00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:03.574]  We have the graphs, we have the evidence, folks are doing a good job of exposing that.
[00:19:03.574 --> 00:19:10.520]  Mainstream media is just trying to gaslight everyone that Trump is the loser, Biden is the winner, there is no election fraud, move forward.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.181]  But that's not working.
[00:19:12.181 --> 00:19:20.729]  And so the system is really starting to panic because President Trump understands he's already defeated four other coup attempts.
[00:19:20.729 --> 00:19:24.152]  And this one they scripted so much and all the evidence of fraud is coming out.
[00:19:24.152 --> 00:19:26.474]  So as long as we hold on and the President holds on,
[00:19:28.308 --> 00:19:37.291]  We can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat legitimately, except for one thing.
[00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:42.633]  You notice about a month before the election, they shift purely to Trump's the reason COVID happened.
[00:19:42.633 --> 00:19:47.134]  200 plus thousand Americans have died because of COVID, they claimed.
[00:19:47.134 --> 00:19:48.774]  Most of those died of something else.
[00:19:48.774 --> 00:19:50.155]  And it's all Trump's fault.
[00:19:51.636 --> 00:19:58.442]  And then a lot of people thought that once Biden became president-elect, at least on the surface, that he would remove the COVID lockdown.
[00:19:58.442 --> 00:19:59.382]  No, no, no, no.
[00:19:59.382 --> 00:20:04.807]  This is meant to break the U.S., put us all on welfare, socialize us, cloward and pivot.
[00:20:04.807 --> 00:20:07.349]  This is the end of the country.
[00:20:07.349 --> 00:20:10.632]  And once they've got us down, they're never going to let us back up.
[00:20:10.632 --> 00:20:13.394]  So this is the breaking of the will of the nation.
[00:20:13.394 --> 00:20:17.137]  And now he's announced his new task force and said, mandatory masks for two more years.
[00:20:18.151 --> 00:20:20.052]  Forced contact tracing.
[00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:23.414]  Forced inoculations when Bill Gates' vaccine comes out.
[00:20:23.414 --> 00:20:26.757]  Not the new ones that are a lot weaker and actually work.
[00:20:26.757 --> 00:20:28.117]  I'm not defending those vaccines.
[00:20:28.117 --> 00:20:36.623]  I'm just saying they want to keep you locked down waiting for their vaccine.
[00:20:36.623 --> 00:20:37.604]  And so here's how it works.
[00:20:37.604 --> 00:20:39.004]  And I said this six months ago.
[00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:39.925]  I said it a week ago.
[00:20:39.925 --> 00:20:42.427]  I shot a special report on Saturday.
[00:20:42.427 --> 00:20:43.888]  I shot a special report on Sunday.
[00:20:44.821 --> 00:20:47.562]  That have almost a million views on Man.Video.
[00:20:47.562 --> 00:20:52.585]  So I'm not telling you this now, because I'm just now saying I predicted it.
[00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:55.186]  We know the enemy battle plan.
[00:20:55.186 --> 00:20:59.488]  So understand, this is what they're going to do.
[00:20:59.488 --> 00:21:03.230]  Biden has announced his new task force.
[00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:08.372]  He blames Trump for the 260,000 deaths, again, most of them did not cover.
[00:21:08.372 --> 00:21:11.814]  When Trump doesn't adopt what his task force calls for,
[00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:24.732]  They will say Trump is killing people, he's responsible, 25th Amendment, unfit to serve, and demand his cabinet vote to remove him.
[00:21:24.732 --> 00:21:31.478]  That's what they've been wargaming, that's what they've been preparing, that's what they've been getting ready from the very, very start.
[00:21:38.803 --> 00:21:53.893]  And that's the arrogance of these people marching Hunter Biden and the daughter with her diary about her dad molesting her and all of it right up there to flaunt it in our face when Biden had his so-called victory speech.
[00:21:53.893 --> 00:21:58.396]  No crowds, no excitement, no support, can barely talk.
[00:21:58.396 --> 00:22:00.437]  Well, because puppets can't talk.
[00:22:00.437 --> 00:22:03.199]  He's the perfect marionette.
[00:22:03.199 --> 00:22:07.962]  So let me quantify what I'm saying to all of you right now.
[00:22:10.216 --> 00:22:11.858]  They got Trump into the lockdown.
[00:22:11.858 --> 00:22:15.682]  They got Trump to go along with the COVID hoax.
[00:22:15.682 --> 00:22:18.025]  Then he figured it out towards the end and said no.
[00:22:18.025 --> 00:22:19.126]  Began to back it up.
[00:22:19.126 --> 00:22:22.509]  Did a great job to get the economy going back.
[00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:24.932]  They bring COVID hype back in.
[00:22:24.932 --> 00:22:25.813]  The winter's coming.
[00:22:25.813 --> 00:22:27.955]  There's more deaths from flu and other things.
[00:22:27.955 --> 00:22:29.257]  They can add that into the equation.
[00:22:34.451 --> 00:22:49.523]  And then they sit back and they say, every death is President Trump's fault, every death is because of him, and every day he doesn't sign over his authority to this new task force and agree to what they say, every death is on his shoulders.
[00:22:49.523 --> 00:22:56.128]  Then, if Trump buckles to them, it's not about new deaths, it's about new cases.
[00:22:56.128 --> 00:22:59.971]  That's what's skyrocketing, that's the hoax.
[00:22:59.971 --> 00:23:01.753]  Every day Trump doesn't buckle to them,
[00:23:03.817 --> 00:23:09.761]  They say every death is his fault, but if he does buckle to them and says, fine, I'll leave.
[00:23:09.761 --> 00:23:12.163]  You go ahead and your task force makes the decisions.
[00:23:12.163 --> 00:23:19.507]  They will say he's repudiated and he's admittedly a fraud and that it was his fault and he's admitted guilt.
[00:23:19.507 --> 00:23:23.210]  So what does President Trump need to do right now to counter this?
[00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:26.632]  Well, he needs to button up.
[00:23:26.632 --> 00:23:27.533]  He needs to get ready.
[00:23:29.343 --> 00:23:38.806]  He needs to come out and just level with the American people's eye to eye, straight up, and say all of this information.
[00:23:38.806 --> 00:23:40.206]  He can show Newsweek.
[00:23:40.206 --> 00:23:42.126]  He can show New Scientist.
[00:23:42.126 --> 00:23:50.989]  Fauci and Obama funded controversial bat COVID virus, coronavirus at Wuhan.
[00:23:51.974 --> 00:23:52.635]  And how the U.N.
[00:23:52.635 --> 00:24:06.348]  admits they helped cover up what was really going on with the virus with the Communist Chinese, and how Fauci works for the U.N., and how Fauci makes money off of vaccines, and how Bill Gates does, and how there's all the conflicts of interest.
[00:24:06.348 --> 00:24:15.838]  And Trump has to go on the total war path because their entire attack is going to be about his lack of response to COVID-19, which isn't even true.
[00:24:17.261 --> 00:24:31.278]  But just pointing out that he, you know, banned flights from China, obviously some deadly thing we're being told, whether it was real or not, he did the lockdown of the flights trying to protect the country up front.
[00:24:31.278 --> 00:24:33.701]  But he's just going to go back and say, I protected you.
[00:24:33.701 --> 00:24:34.602]  That's not enough.
[00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:39.402]  He has to go after the weak spot, the underbelly.
[00:24:39.402 --> 00:24:41.083]  They've never been weaker.
[00:24:41.083 --> 00:24:43.805]  Not Obama, who helped set it up in Wuhan.
[00:24:43.805 --> 00:24:44.825]  Not Fauci.
[00:24:44.825 --> 00:24:45.826]  Not Gates.
[00:24:45.826 --> 00:24:49.889]  Not the Democrats that said keep the borders open.
[00:24:49.889 --> 00:24:51.350]  They wanted the infection here.
[00:24:52.742 --> 00:25:06.805]  Because what it does is it spreads fast, it kills old people, it kills people that have vitamin mineral deficiencies, it creates fear, it creates a lot of false positives so that you can say everyone is suspect and everyone is bad and everyone is evil.
[00:25:09.065 --> 00:25:11.767]  And so it's the perfect virus with all the false positives.
[00:25:11.767 --> 00:25:17.811]  We've had a coronavirus or had the flu or had an infection in the last few years to put us all under surveillance grid.
[00:25:17.811 --> 00:25:19.432]  The perfect problem that can never be fixed.
[00:25:19.432 --> 00:25:22.114]  That's why they're now admitting, Oh, actually the vaccine won't work.
[00:25:22.114 --> 00:25:23.975]  The antibodies don't last too long.
[00:25:23.975 --> 00:25:25.856]  Oh, you just should never go out again.
[00:25:25.856 --> 00:25:27.497]  You got to wear a mask forever.
[00:25:27.497 --> 00:25:28.338]  You're all bad.
[00:25:28.338 --> 00:25:29.419]  You're all evil.
[00:25:29.419 --> 00:25:38.245]  And then they just count everybody from the pneumonia and the flu and the cancer and the heart attack and the car wreck and the gunshot wound column in COVID.
[00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:38.805]  That's admitted.
[00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:56.510]  And that it's the perfect governor, the perfect throttle, the perfect gate to turn the economy off whenever they want, selectively kill the economy, get us into debt, and selectively shut down systems during elections and have mail-in ballots forever.
[00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:01.531]  Bring in the casual society, bring in the social credit score with the phones to track where you go and what you do.
[00:26:01.531 --> 00:26:03.872]  And it's all being announced, it's all being done.
[00:26:03.872 --> 00:26:06.693]  So it's a permanent martial law takeover.
[00:26:06.693 --> 00:26:07.333]  Here's the headline.
[00:26:08.305 --> 00:26:09.947]  Hope you spread the live link.
[00:26:09.947 --> 00:26:15.873]  Monday live, Alex Jones knows Joe Biden's next moves and how to stop him.
[00:26:15.873 --> 00:26:22.801]  Infowars has discovered the global's deep state strategy to complete their steal of the election and put the United States on permanent martial law lockdown.
[00:26:22.801 --> 00:26:27.707]  I'm going to explain that when I come back, why the stakes are so high and what President Trump has to do in a nutshell.
[00:26:29.093 --> 00:26:31.816]  Because they know there's the Midwest and the South and everywhere else.
[00:26:31.816 --> 00:26:33.037]  They want to fully break us.
[00:26:33.037 --> 00:26:35.659]  It's a communist strategy, run by big banks.
[00:26:35.659 --> 00:26:42.586]  They want to have decades of us shut down, just like they did the Chinese under Mao, when he killed 80 million of them, to make them submit.
[00:26:42.586 --> 00:26:44.988]  We're about to go into the real reprogramming now.
[00:26:45.967 --> 00:26:53.569]  And they're going to shut the economy off first to bring you to your knees and mobilize giant hordes of people who will do whatever they say.
[00:26:53.569 --> 00:26:57.330]  Communist China has been fully open for business for more than six months.
[00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:02.091]  But the European Union and every other major Western nation is still under some form of lockdown.
[00:27:02.091 --> 00:27:09.693]  And the lockdowns are getting more intense and people are being told they're going to be arrested if they leave their houses, just like we've seen in Australia.
[00:27:10.413 --> 00:27:13.815]  You see, the authoritarians want total control.
[00:27:13.815 --> 00:27:19.938]  And because they don't respect this, because the general public puts up with so much abuse, they're going for broke.
[00:27:19.938 --> 00:27:20.958]  Why shouldn't they?
[00:27:20.958 --> 00:27:22.879]  They never get in trouble for the big illegal wars.
[00:27:22.879 --> 00:27:25.260]  They never get in trouble for the Chinese slave camps.
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.882]  They never get in trouble for all the terrible exploitation in Africa.
[00:27:28.882 --> 00:27:32.324]  They never get in trouble for shipping fentanyl and other deadly drugs into our country.
[00:27:33.044 --> 00:27:36.105]  And so why shouldn't they go for broke?
[00:27:36.105 --> 00:27:38.847]  Because so many people are domesticated and they're soft.
[00:27:38.847 --> 00:27:40.327]  And they have Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:27:40.327 --> 00:27:41.948]  They love their abusers.
[00:27:41.948 --> 00:27:44.109]  They can't believe they're being lied to.
[00:27:44.109 --> 00:27:46.150]  They can't believe they're being conned.
[00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.171]  And so, they're going into bondage.
[00:27:48.171 --> 00:27:50.552]  You see, there's always a minority that says no.
[00:27:50.552 --> 00:27:51.833]  And Infowars is that minority.
[00:27:53.752 --> 00:27:58.015]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed.
[00:27:58.015 --> 00:27:59.215]  And why is that?
[00:27:59.215 --> 00:28:07.020]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree-like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds.
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.503]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[00:28:11.503 --> 00:28:12.783]  They didn't know why.
[00:28:12.783 --> 00:28:18.547]  Well, with modern science we know it's one of the purest, cleanest organic forms of selenium.

[00:28:57.212 --> 00:28:58.132]  The days of hell.
[00:28:58.132 --> 00:29:00.554]  The nightmare is here.
[00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:05.613]  79 days of hell has begun!
[00:29:05.613 --> 00:29:25.508]  Multinational corporations, the mainstream media apparatus, and social media tech giants are all now being deployed by the archaic, inbred, crooked establishment to interfere with the 2020 US elections, remove the populist champion of the people, Donald J. Trump,
[00:29:26.048 --> 00:29:36.932]  And install the decrepit, perverted, traitorous establishment puppet, Joe Biden, along with rabid radical hag, Kamala Harris.
[00:29:36.932 --> 00:29:44.115]  Keep your heads on a swivel and tune in to 79days.news for tomorrow's news today.
[00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:46.996]  79days.news, America's last stand.
[00:29:46.996 --> 00:29:47.716]  79days.news.
[00:29:57.068 --> 00:30:00.969]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:00.969 --> 00:30:21.497]  Back in the core of the human event, it becomes necessary for one person to install the torrential fan and connect the fan with another.
[00:30:21.497 --> 00:30:24.718]  And to remove all the power from the earth,
[00:30:49.382 --> 00:31:18.074]  The devil's henchman is doomed and died A sacred brotherhood, an ancient rite Politicians and the devil lies behind Violate your rights, no more equality Surrender freedom, your social security
[00:31:20.709 --> 00:31:29.197]  Ladies and gentlemen, the social contract is being broken right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:29.197 --> 00:31:43.570]  And the total takeover is taking place where even if President Trump tries to restart the economy and exposes these criminals, they don't care because they control the blue states, the blue cities, they control the independent so-called school districts.
[00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:45.391]  These are all cults of control.
[00:31:46.343 --> 00:31:48.404]  We're with no evidence, no proof now.
[00:31:48.404 --> 00:31:58.147]  They go, oh, someone at the school, someone at the factory, someone at the farm, someone at the warehouse, someone at the TV station had COVID.
[00:31:58.147 --> 00:32:01.868]  Now you've all got to self-quarantine for 14 days.
[00:32:01.868 --> 00:32:06.670]  And oh, you've got to check in with this app everywhere you go, everything you do.
[00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.511]  And if you're seen out, you'll lose your job.
[00:32:09.511 --> 00:32:11.992]  That's happening to people all over the United States.
[00:32:11.992 --> 00:32:14.313]  It's happening to crew members, here to their wives,
[00:32:16.596 --> 00:32:19.100]  This is the reality.
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:25.811]  And now the Bar Association of New York says we are coming with forced inoculations.
[00:32:25.811 --> 00:32:29.076]  Oh, they're now your doctors, the lawyers of New York.
[00:32:29.076 --> 00:32:29.957]  You have no rights.
[00:32:31.144 --> 00:32:40.371]  And now Bill Gates and these lawyers are your doctor, and they're telling you what they're going to do to you, and President Trump was not going to push forced inoculations.
[00:32:40.371 --> 00:32:46.476]  He was creating a quicker vaccine that wasn't the mRNA super dangerous vaccine that Bill Gates had.
[00:32:46.476 --> 00:32:51.560]  Still dangerous, I still wouldn't take it, but Trump's coming up with.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.842]  And now you notice that Cuomo and others are on TV.
[00:32:55.615 --> 00:32:56.655]  Saying don't take it.
[00:32:56.655 --> 00:32:59.196]  It doesn't matter if Pfizer says it's safe.
[00:32:59.196 --> 00:33:01.597]  Doesn't matter if they say it's 90% effective.
[00:33:01.597 --> 00:33:04.037]  Doesn't matter if it doesn't have a bunch of side effects.
[00:33:04.037 --> 00:33:06.478]  Because they want to keep that fear going.
[00:33:06.478 --> 00:33:07.959]  They want to control you.
[00:33:07.959 --> 00:33:09.539]  They want to run your life.
[00:33:09.539 --> 00:33:10.959]  And they only do this to schmucks.
[00:33:10.959 --> 00:33:12.860]  They only do this to people that have Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:33:14.957 --> 00:33:21.285]  They would never do this to a free people that stood up for themselves, but they will do it to us because we've lost connection to the land.
[00:33:21.285 --> 00:33:22.927]  We've lost connection to reality.
[00:33:22.927 --> 00:33:26.652]  We've lost connection to ourselves.
[00:33:26.652 --> 00:33:30.097]  And so now the globalists are making their move on us.
[00:33:30.097 --> 00:33:33.321]  And how did I, 13 years ago in Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement?
[00:33:35.523 --> 00:33:42.067]  Come out and say that they're going to come with forced inoculations and digital AI tracking systems to control where you go and what you do.
[00:33:42.067 --> 00:33:52.794]  Because they said world government will be brought in by economic collapse, by viral releases and plagues, and by third world collapse flooding the first world.
[00:33:52.794 --> 00:33:54.315]  It's in the Demos Group.
[00:33:54.315 --> 00:33:58.717]  It's in the documents that Judicial Watch got 14 years ago.
[00:33:58.717 --> 00:34:00.038]  We know their plan.
[00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:02.360]  We know what they'll do in Operation Lockstep.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:02.820]  We know it.
[00:34:04.793 --> 00:34:18.564]  And so I'm here talking to the President, talking to you, talking to the world today, with record audiences tuned in to TheInfoWars.com and Band.Video streams, and I know radio stations have huge audiences out there.
[00:34:18.564 --> 00:34:21.066]  But the question is, what are we going to do about this?
[00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:28.148]  You create a virus that spreads really well, that isn't very deadly, but makes everyone suspect, makes everyone bad.
[00:34:28.148 --> 00:34:30.871]  Then they tell you there's no vaccine that will ever protect you.
[00:34:30.871 --> 00:34:34.356]  Trump talks to scientists and they go, well, there is one that might be a little something.
[00:34:34.356 --> 00:34:40.283]  But your body won't even produce antibodies for this vaccine because it doesn't see it as big enough of a threat.
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:59.432]  And top scientists have said that, and every day there's another press conference with dozens and hundreds, in some cases, of scientists and doctors and epidemiologists and virologists saying, this is overblown, this is a fraud, most of the deaths were caused by something else, and those all get banned off the Internet.
[00:34:59.432 --> 00:35:00.793]  So, that was all a test.
[00:35:00.793 --> 00:35:03.675]  We put up with the beta test of Internet censorship.
[00:35:03.675 --> 00:35:06.196]  Trump didn't stop it, he spoke out against it.
[00:35:06.196 --> 00:35:11.540]  But it wasn't enough, and so now we failed the test, and now the chains are really going on.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:21.943]  And that's why everybody has a sick feeling because these unions and these bureaucracies and these Democratic Party systems are cults!
[00:35:21.943 --> 00:35:28.865]  And they want full control of you to be able to shut things off and shut things down when they want to.
[00:35:28.865 --> 00:35:31.026]  So let's look at some of these headlines.
[00:35:31.026 --> 00:35:36.747]  Again, Monday Live, Alex Jones knows Joe Biden's next moves and how to stop him.
[00:35:36.747 --> 00:35:38.668]  He's going to come out, he already has.
[00:35:40.964 --> 00:35:41.104]  I think?
[00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:12.275]  With all the evidence and politically, Fauci, Gates, the UN, the lies, Governor Whitmer, Governor Cuomo, all of them that he tried to be nice to and said they were doing a good job while they stabbed him in the back.
[00:36:12.275 --> 00:36:16.377]  Now he must go on the total warpath and expose them.
[00:36:16.377 --> 00:36:19.219]  Not the old rhetoric about, oh, I blocked the flights from China.
[00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:23.461]  He needs to go directly at the heart of it and he knows this already.
[00:36:23.461 --> 00:36:25.302]  And this is the next big thing he's got to hit.
[00:36:25.302 --> 00:36:26.823]  This is April, the UN.
[00:36:26.823 --> 00:36:28.163]  And sure enough, it's all true.
[00:36:28.163 --> 00:36:29.504]  They're the ones that have the global lockdown.
[00:36:30.851 --> 00:36:34.515]  Now they're the saviors for the crisis they themselves have created.
[00:36:34.515 --> 00:36:36.717]  Instead of a coronavirus, the hunger will kill us.
[00:36:36.717 --> 00:36:40.762]  A global food crisis looms.
[00:36:40.762 --> 00:36:46.067]  World Food Program wins Nobel Prize for fight against hunger as a weapon of war.
[00:36:46.067 --> 00:36:47.809]  When they're using it as a weapon of war.
[00:36:47.809 --> 00:36:49.271]  How sick!
[00:36:49.271 --> 00:36:51.153]  Here's the head of the UK Ministry of Defence.
[00:36:53.083 --> 00:36:59.010]  Coming out and saying there's a real risk of a third world war being unleashed.
[00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:00.912]  Top UK General warns.
[00:37:03.865 --> 00:37:17.732]  In an interview with Sky News, the UK Chief of Defence Staff, General Sir Rick Carter, warned that the global economic meltdown caused by COVID-19 lockdown, not by COVID-19 pandemic, may lead to new security threats, which in turn may start a new war.
[00:37:17.732 --> 00:37:26.957]  He goes into the mass starvation, the mass death, and the conflicts already happening that could trigger a new world war.
[00:37:26.957 --> 00:37:32.260]  UNICEF, 1.2 million child deaths, starvation, all of it.
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:32.760]  That is
[00:37:34.431 --> 00:37:35.812]  The reality.
[00:37:35.812 --> 00:37:47.777]  So when they shake the deaths of COVID at you that are way overinflated and full of propaganda, the president needs to have press conferences with hundreds and hundreds of these doctor groups.
[00:37:48.837 --> 00:37:52.679]  The president needs to frontally assault Fauci and the Wuhan lab.
[00:37:52.679 --> 00:38:00.462]  The president needs to go right at the juggler and expose how the globalists, the UN, the communists, the EU are using this as a power grab.
[00:38:00.462 --> 00:38:10.466]  And every socialist mayor, every communist mayor, every communist school district is following this system of a power grab.
[00:38:10.466 --> 00:38:15.528]  And the universities are bringing in apps to say when you can travel, when you can go places, when you can do things.
[00:38:17.722 --> 00:38:19.223]  It's absolutely crazy.
[00:38:19.223 --> 00:38:21.364]  We're just accepting the cash flow society.
[00:38:21.364 --> 00:38:23.104]  We're accepting the Internet of Things.
[00:38:23.104 --> 00:38:25.065]  We're accepting the global social score.
[00:38:25.065 --> 00:38:29.027]  And it's all designed to shut down Main Street and make us dependent on them.
[00:38:29.027 --> 00:38:30.668]  You're like, well then, the left loves it.
[00:38:30.668 --> 00:38:33.069]  They go, well, I'll just sit at home and do nothing.
[00:38:33.069 --> 00:38:38.571]  This is being done to trigger a collapse that kills tens of millions of the third world that is already happening.
[00:38:41.104 --> 00:38:42.345]  The globalists have made their move.
[00:38:42.345 --> 00:38:43.507]  They believe we're domesticated.
[00:38:43.507 --> 00:38:44.648]  They believe we're stupid.
[00:38:44.648 --> 00:38:47.110]  And now they're dropping the hammer.
[00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:48.432]  Let's look at some of these headlines.
[00:38:48.432 --> 00:38:52.076]  Trump in denial over election defeat as Biden gears up to fight COVID.
[00:38:52.076 --> 00:38:53.898]  See, he'll be presidential.
[00:38:53.898 --> 00:38:55.279]  He'll take on the COVID.
[00:38:55.279 --> 00:38:59.063]  He'll agree with the EU and the UK to lock everything down.
[00:38:59.063 --> 00:39:01.265]  And he's going to announce the lockdown in the next few days.
[00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:23.158]  And he'll be the president because the blue cities, the blue states, the bureaucracies, the universities, everything they control, the institutions, because they're the establishment, they're not the resistance, will follow that edict because it's U.N., Bill Gates, Big Pharma, world government, and there will be Trump watching the economy shut back down again while he sits in the Oval Office.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.960]  That's the checkmate operation.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:39.603]  But if you expose the checkmate and the entire scam, and if he gets up and lays it out, and hits them head-on, then they will implode and burn because everybody already knows the truth.
[00:39:39.603 --> 00:39:48.666]  And if you tell us people you're about to have the end of your prosperity and endless COVID lockdowns forever, if you don't stand with me and stop this foreign takeover, then we win.
[00:39:48.666 --> 00:39:49.726]  Owen Schroer is coming in.
[00:39:49.726 --> 00:39:50.166]  Stay with us.
[00:39:52.403 --> 00:39:57.867]  The controlled corporate media are mouthpieces for any big corporation or government that'll pay them.
[00:39:57.867 --> 00:39:58.508]  It's that simple.
[00:39:58.508 --> 00:40:02.070]  And they've used our open, free society against us.
[00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:12.138]  The controlled media will talk about a few mistakes I've made over the years and obsess over it and say, see, he's a liar on purpose, even though our success rate, our accuracy rate is way, way better than theirs.
[00:40:12.138 --> 00:40:13.939]  We try to tell the truth.
[00:40:13.939 --> 00:40:14.640]  They try to lie.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.241]  They try to deceive.
[00:40:16.241 --> 00:40:20.664]  I'm trying to get people to realize that the globalists operate and how they manipulate, how they
[00:40:21.965 --> 00:40:23.026]  Bamboozle the public.
[00:40:23.026 --> 00:40:28.011]  I'm trying to get the public to ask the questions and to not believe what they're told in the face.
[00:40:28.011 --> 00:40:32.635]  I'm trying to get people to research for themselves.
[00:40:32.635 --> 00:40:39.781]  The globalists and their controlled corporate press say that researching and not trusting media is evil and is a conspiracy theory.
[00:40:39.781 --> 00:40:41.903]  Well, again, on its face, that is a fraud.
[00:40:42.863 --> 00:40:50.307]  Question everything, question InfoWars, add your own research to it, and then decide what you're going to promote to others and what news sources are accurate.
[00:40:50.307 --> 00:40:52.768]  I believe InfoWars is the best source out there.
[00:40:52.768 --> 00:40:53.568]  Warning!
[00:40:53.568 --> 00:40:54.288]  Warning!
[00:40:54.288 --> 00:40:55.149]  Warning!
[00:40:55.149 --> 00:41:10.736]  There is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover, the giant third world collapse, and a new world war that is going to be triggered by the new COVID lockdown announced by globalist systems in Europe, in Asia, and now in the United States.
[00:41:11.676 --> 00:41:26.407]  Joe Biden is set to announce today that he has a new COVID task force that is calling for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude, contact tracing, forced inoculations coming, but most importantly, a new lockdown.
[00:41:27.248 --> 00:41:34.514]  That way he can say that Trump is to blame for COVID and claim that only a new lockdown will stop COVID.
[00:41:34.514 --> 00:41:40.519]  Then of course, when that new lockdown doesn't work, those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it.
[00:41:40.519 --> 00:41:44.102]  And that's when all the mass arrests start sometime towards the end of next year.
[00:41:44.102 --> 00:41:47.285]  This is a permanent martial law plan.
[00:41:47.285 --> 00:41:52.129]  Trump must repudiate it, expose Fauci and Gates and the UN takeover, not play games with it.
[00:41:54.321 --> 00:41:58.785]  Two Info Wars best-selling products are now back in stocks for being sold out for months.
[00:41:58.785 --> 00:42:04.950]  BioTree Selenium from the mustard seed, essential in all electrochemical activity of the cells in the body.
[00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:06.752]  That's every human activity.
[00:42:06.752 --> 00:42:10.855]  And on top of it, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% Cucuminoid.
[00:42:12.356 --> 00:42:12.896]  We're good to go.
[00:42:33.348 --> 00:42:36.009]  And free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:42:36.009 --> 00:42:39.190]  That's bio, true selenium from the mustard seed.
[00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:40.491]  It's amazing.
[00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:46.073]  And on top of it, we also have Body's ultimate turmeric formula at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:42:46.073 --> 00:42:47.734]  This sale will not last long.
[00:42:47.734 --> 00:42:49.134]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:42:49.134 --> 00:42:50.575]  We really need to try these products.
[00:42:50.575 --> 00:42:52.676]  People absolutely love them because they really, really work.
[00:42:52.676 --> 00:42:53.596]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:42:54.076 --> 00:42:59.482]  For those drinking the globalist Kool-Aid, what I call the Invincibly Ignorant, there is no hope.
[00:42:59.482 --> 00:43:03.747]  But for those of you that care and are informed, we have more than hope.
[00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:08.091]  We have history on our side if we take action and if we spread the truth.
[00:43:08.091 --> 00:43:09.393]  I have been warning everyone.
[00:43:09.993 --> 00:43:13.076]  Of exactly what was going to come in the exact order.
[00:43:13.076 --> 00:43:14.037]  How did I do that?
[00:43:14.037 --> 00:43:19.582]  Because the globalists war game it all in public and prepare the public with brainwashing on MSN.
[00:43:19.582 --> 00:43:25.287]  When they put out the 80 million ballots, we knew it was so they could stuff it after the polls closed.
[00:43:25.287 --> 00:43:29.831]  That's why they got federal courts to rule to keep it open for weeks if need be.
[00:43:29.831 --> 00:43:30.932]  Again, it was so simple.
[00:43:31.593 --> 00:43:35.556]  And of course, you see the media heat up saying Trump did a bad job on COVID.
[00:43:35.556 --> 00:43:43.821]  And that once Biden was, quote, President-elect, he would order Trump to admit that he did a bad job and admit that he needs a second lockdown.
[00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:50.045]  And if he doesn't go under Biden's immediate control and put that lockdown in place, he'll try to remove the President with the 25th Amendment.
[00:43:50.045 --> 00:43:56.609]  And all of that is to trick Trump to take the blame for COVID that's Chinese.
[00:43:56.609 --> 00:43:59.250]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:12.469 --> 00:44:16.773]  Start this program with a special bulletin.
[00:44:16.773 --> 00:44:22.077]  America is now under martial law.
[00:44:22.077 --> 00:44:27.561]  All constitutional rights have been suspended.
[00:44:27.561 --> 00:44:29.723]  Stay in your homes.
[00:44:29.723 --> 00:44:35.848]  Do not attempt to contact loved ones, insurance agents, or attorneys.
[00:44:35.848 --> 00:44:37.930]  Shut up!
[00:44:39.171 --> 00:44:44.477]  Do not attempt to think or depression may occur.
[00:44:44.477 --> 00:44:46.379]  Stay in your homes.
[00:44:46.379 --> 00:44:51.264]  Curfew is at 7pm sharp after work.
[00:44:51.264 --> 00:45:00.813]  Anyone caught outside the gates of their subdivision sectors after curfew will be shot.
[00:45:00.813 --> 00:45:01.875]  Remain calm.
[00:45:02.805 --> 00:45:04.607]  Do not panic.
[00:45:04.607 --> 00:45:12.515]  Your neighborhood watch officer will be by to collect urine samples in the morning.
[00:45:12.515 --> 00:45:20.023]  Anyone caught interfering with the collection of urine samples will be shot.
[00:45:21.278 --> 00:45:26.019]  Houses will be inspected for trace elements at noon.
[00:45:26.019 --> 00:45:39.963]  Anyone who fails to display the required embossed black velvet Mexican painting of Alexander Haig on their living room wall will be shot.
[00:45:39.963 --> 00:45:48.986]  Cameras and surveillance equipment will be posted on all lampposts and streetlights.
[00:45:49.944 --> 00:45:57.687]  Anyone failing to attend required worship services on Sunday will be promptly arrested.
[00:45:57.687 --> 00:45:59.648]  Okay, this is Jelebri Offra.
[00:45:59.648 --> 00:46:05.270]  30 years ago, a liberal making fun of what martial law would look like in the future.
[00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:11.573]  But notice, it's not the right-wingers doing the martial law and calling for the Truth and Reconciliation re-education camps.
[00:46:11.573 --> 00:46:12.393]  It's the left.
[00:46:12.393 --> 00:46:14.794]  We'll talk about it all next hour with Owen Schroeder.
[00:46:14.794 --> 00:46:16.715]  But here's a really important report.
[00:46:17.506 --> 00:46:23.149]  With Ted Cruz on Fox News laying out what's really going on on the leftist socialist abyss we're facing.
[00:46:23.149 --> 00:46:26.750]  Here it is.
[00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:29.532]  Senator Ted Cruz sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[00:46:29.532 --> 00:46:34.374]  He was part of President George W. Bush's 2000 Florida recount team.
[00:46:34.374 --> 00:46:36.535]  And Senator, it's always an honor to have you on this program.
[00:46:36.535 --> 00:46:39.616]  Thanks for being here.
[00:46:39.616 --> 00:46:40.297]  Good morning, Maria.
[00:46:40.297 --> 00:46:40.957]  It's good to be with you.
[00:46:42.675 --> 00:46:44.016]  First, assess where we are.
[00:46:44.016 --> 00:46:52.479]  You heard this weekend what we saw in terms of President-elect and Vice President-elect from the media.
[00:46:52.479 --> 00:46:55.780]  What do you believe is the status of this race?
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.583]  Well, I think that is way premature.
[00:47:00.583 --> 00:47:04.167]  At this point, we do not know who has prevailed in the election.
[00:47:04.167 --> 00:47:12.957]  The media is desperately trying to get everyone to coronate Joe Biden as the next president, but that's not how it works.
[00:47:12.957 --> 00:47:15.300]  The media does not get to select our president.
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.763]  The American people get to elect our president.
[00:47:18.704 --> 00:47:29.131]  At this point, we've got numerous states that are very closely and vigorously contested, from Pennsylvania, to Georgia, to Arizona, to New Mexico, to Michigan, to Wisconsin.
[00:47:29.131 --> 00:47:34.074]  In all of those states, there are serious disputes about the vote totals.
[00:47:34.074 --> 00:47:37.015]  And there's a legal process to resolve those disputes.
[00:47:37.015 --> 00:47:40.398]  So at this point, we should allow the rule of law to operate.
[00:47:40.398 --> 00:47:42.779]  We should allow the legal process to move forward.
[00:47:42.779 --> 00:47:47.162]  And when that process is concluded, which it will be in a matter of weeks,
[00:47:47.682 --> 00:47:57.843]  We will know who prevailed in the elections, but the fact that the big newsrooms in New York City want Donald Trump to lose, they don't get to decide that.
[00:47:57.843 --> 00:47:58.985]  That's a question for the voters.
[00:48:00.521 --> 00:48:05.205]  We are looking at multiple recounts in multiple states.
[00:48:05.205 --> 00:48:06.726]  We just heard from Rudy Giuliani.
[00:48:06.726 --> 00:48:10.829]  He's going to be dropping a lawsuit in Pennsylvania tomorrow.
[00:48:10.829 --> 00:48:12.170]  Other lawsuits throughout the week.
[00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:18.595]  He said by the end of the week he'll have five lawsuits and there are ten states, he says, that are potentially stolen.
[00:48:18.595 --> 00:48:22.678]  800,000 votes in question, according to Rudy Giuliani.
[00:48:22.678 --> 00:48:24.420]  Walk us through the process.
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:27.462]  You are a constitutionalist, an expert on the Supreme Court.
[00:48:27.843 --> 00:48:32.316]  How does this work in terms of the federal court system with these lawsuits pending?
[00:48:34.721 --> 00:48:37.383]  Well, we've seen multiple lawsuits already filed.
[00:48:37.383 --> 00:48:43.728]  I expect there will be more lawsuits filed, probably in each of those states that I mentioned, and maybe more.
[00:48:43.728 --> 00:48:48.692]  We may well see cases filed both in state court and in federal court.
[00:48:48.692 --> 00:48:52.315]  We will have trials on the matters that are contested.
[00:48:52.315 --> 00:48:54.336]  And the purpose of a trial is to hear evidence.
[00:48:54.336 --> 00:48:58.940]  We're hearing lots of allegations of a dead person voted.
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:01.682]  We heard a report from one county in Michigan
[00:49:02.202 --> 00:49:08.287]  Where the election software mistakenly counted 6,000 votes that were cast for Donald Trump.
[00:49:08.287 --> 00:49:09.928]  It switched them to Joe Biden.
[00:49:09.928 --> 00:49:12.089]  Now they apparently caught that.
[00:49:12.089 --> 00:49:16.132]  But that same software is used in 47 counties throughout Michigan.
[00:49:16.132 --> 00:49:21.456]  That needs to be examined to determine that there's not a problem counting the votes.
[00:49:21.456 --> 00:49:24.038]  And the legal process is how you resolve those questions.
[00:49:24.298 --> 00:49:32.467]  You know, one of the frustrating things, just as an American watching this, is you hear all these allegations of what's going on, and it's hard to know what the facts are.
[00:49:32.467 --> 00:49:33.829]  It's hard to know what the truth is.
[00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:41.998]  Well, we have a process for ascertaining the truth, which is that you can go and present evidence and test it in a court of law, and then those appeals will go up.
[00:49:42.478 --> 00:49:49.262]  Both through the state appellate system and the federal appellate system, and this case could very easily end up at the U.S.
[00:49:49.262 --> 00:49:50.402]  Supreme Court.
[00:49:50.402 --> 00:49:57.506]  You know, you mentioned Bush versus Gore, which I was part of representing then-Governor George W. Bush.
[00:49:57.506 --> 00:49:58.266]  In the course of 36 days,
[00:50:00.147 --> 00:50:02.630]  We had multiple cases throughout the state of Florida.
[00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:04.592]  It went twice to the Florida Supreme Court.
[00:50:04.592 --> 00:50:05.873]  It went twice to the U.S.
[00:50:05.873 --> 00:50:06.413]  Supreme Court.
[00:50:06.413 --> 00:50:09.456]  It took 36 days to resolve, and we got an answer.
[00:50:09.456 --> 00:50:19.486]  I would expect a similar process to play out here, despite the media trying to tell everyone, give up, go home, we know who we want to win.
[00:50:19.486 --> 00:50:20.727]  That's not how it works.
[00:50:20.727 --> 00:50:24.731]  We need to follow the law, and that means allowing the legal process to play out.
[00:50:25.967 --> 00:50:34.534]  So we did not learn about the results from Gore versus Bush until December of that year, right?
[00:50:34.534 --> 00:50:35.655]  Yeah.
[00:50:35.655 --> 00:50:46.584]  That's right, and if you look at the federal statute that governs the timing of presidential elections, it actually anticipates that there will be recounts, that there will be contested litigation.
[00:50:46.584 --> 00:50:51.848]  If you look at the federal statute, December 12th is the date that the electors meet to vote.
[00:50:52.308 --> 00:51:02.591]  December 8th is what's called the safe harbor deadline, which is that any contest election before that, if it's resolved, that resolution is presumed valid.
[00:51:02.591 --> 00:51:07.632]  So the federal statute anticipates that there are going to be contests, there are going to be recounts.
[00:51:07.632 --> 00:51:10.433]  And here's one dynamic that's important to understand.
[00:51:10.433 --> 00:51:14.454]  Particularly in this COVID time, this has been a strange election.
[00:51:14.454 --> 00:51:19.555]  On election day, Donald Trump won a large majority of the votes counted on election day.
[00:51:19.555 --> 00:51:20.836]  That was true throughout the country.
[00:51:21.956 --> 00:51:28.580]  With mail-in votes that were early votes, Joe Biden won a significant majority of the mail-in votes that came in.
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.822]  Now, in several states, we're going to see a recount process.
[00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:40.827]  A recount process, you look at those votes, you determine if they're accurate, if they're fraudulent, if they have sufficient signatures, if they meet the statutory standards for a legal vote.
[00:51:41.667 --> 00:51:48.669]  What is interesting is historically, mail-in votes are much more likely to be disqualified in a recount than in-person votes.
[00:52:04.875 --> 00:52:06.118]  I'm not saying that in an elitist way.
[00:52:06.118 --> 00:52:08.403]  I mean, we know their exact next moves.
[00:52:08.403 --> 00:52:09.385]  They're going to call 25th Amendment.
[00:52:09.385 --> 00:52:11.430]  They're going to say all the deaths were Trump's fault.
[00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:15.218]  They're going to say, while he's president-elect, running his fake task force.
[00:52:16.175 --> 00:52:21.257]  Biden, that Trump's gotta do what he's saying or the deaths are in his hands to make himself look legitimate.
[00:52:21.257 --> 00:52:24.299]  Trump cannot assault the statements Biden makes.
[00:52:24.299 --> 00:52:33.563]  He has to assault the whole fraud of the scam and lay it all out in damn White House addresses and it's over for these maggots!
[00:52:33.563 --> 00:52:37.145]  But everyone wants to argue every facet of the scam!
[00:52:38.502 --> 00:52:43.966]  Instead of the entire enchilada of the fact that it's bad.
[00:52:43.966 --> 00:52:52.611]  It's like arguing strategies with the former Soviet Union instead of looking at the Soviet Union being run by evil people.
[00:52:52.611 --> 00:52:55.013]  And look, if we don't get the funds to fund this place, I don't care.
[00:52:55.013 --> 00:52:56.154]  I'm ready to shut this down.
[00:52:56.154 --> 00:52:59.696]  If America wants to lose and go down the tubes and burn in hell, that's fine.
[00:52:59.696 --> 00:53:02.438]  But we have a good chance of beating this and stopping it.
[00:53:03.504 --> 00:53:11.131]  I told you two months ago, I said, I'm trying to sell everything we've got because I think there's a good chance Biden's going to steal it and they're going to shut the economy down permanently.
[00:53:11.131 --> 00:53:18.437]  So if you want to support us so we can put a big fight on with all the stuff we're going to be doing here, I got to sell it all the products we got at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:53:19.684 --> 00:53:21.665]  So the new sale's the same one we had two months ago.

[00:53:26.289 --> 00:53:28.050]  Trump's gonna win, there's no problem.
[00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:31.693]  America in crisis, emergency lockdown 2 is coming.

[00:54:28.938 --> 00:54:31.319]  You want to see more action, get in there and buy the products.
[00:54:31.319 --> 00:54:32.120]  I appreciate you all.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.660]  I'm just saying, point blank.
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:34.681]  Stop the steal.
[00:54:34.681 --> 00:54:36.742]  Republican crisis sale right now.
[00:54:36.742 --> 00:54:37.582]  American crisis.
[00:54:37.582 --> 00:54:39.142]  Emergency lockdown 2 coming.
[00:54:39.142 --> 00:54:40.243]  Get the products while you still can.
[00:54:42.642 --> 00:54:49.228]  We are only here on air facing the globalist onslaught, the DNC funded lawsuits, and everything that's happening because of you.
[00:54:49.228 --> 00:54:56.674]  We built the only truly multimedia independent radio, TV, print, film organization in the world that promotes the truth against the globalists.
[00:54:56.674 --> 00:54:57.955]  We've had a devastating effect.
[00:54:57.955 --> 00:54:59.196]  We're a national treasure.
[00:54:59.196 --> 00:55:01.478]  You're a national treasure for supporting us.
[00:55:01.478 --> 00:55:02.799]  And so go get a t-shirt.
[00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:04.160]  Go get a historic t-shirt.
[00:55:04.941 --> 00:55:07.663]  We've got a funny one that's the Biden groping a woman.
[00:55:07.663 --> 00:55:09.184]  It's a woman's design shirt.
[00:55:09.184 --> 00:55:10.144]  My wife really likes it.
[00:55:10.144 --> 00:55:11.065]  She sent me this gift.
[00:55:11.065 --> 00:55:11.745]  It's pretty cute.
[00:55:11.745 --> 00:55:12.205]  Here it is.
[00:55:12.205 --> 00:55:13.967]  And it just, you know, it's a little historic thing.
[00:55:13.967 --> 00:55:15.287]  I think Trump's gonna win.
[00:55:15.287 --> 00:55:18.129]  But if Biden's able to steal it, we'll be probably shut down pretty quick.
[00:55:18.129 --> 00:55:19.770]  So it'll be a historic thing to have.
[00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:34.399]  You'll only be able to fight them in the third dimension on the street with graffiti, with handbills you hand out, and with noncompliance, not paying taxes, and pulling your kids out of the schools, and just making it a full-time job to expose and fight and obstruct the criminal foreign takeover of America.
[00:55:34.659 --> 00:55:35.862]  We've gotten to that point.
[00:55:35.862 --> 00:55:36.965]  Biden for nursing home.
[00:55:36.965 --> 00:55:39.191]  I hope to retire Biden and that'd be a collector's item.
[00:55:39.191 --> 00:55:40.214]  Get it while you still can.
[00:55:40.214 --> 00:55:41.136]  We're not ordering more.
[00:55:41.136 --> 00:55:42.159]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:55:44.761 --> 00:55:49.925]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes of the two.
[00:55:49.925 --> 00:55:52.967]  One is born of renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[00:55:52.967 --> 00:56:02.054]  One bases its power on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[00:56:02.054 --> 00:56:07.438]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[00:56:08.398 --> 00:56:16.486]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[00:56:16.486 --> 00:56:20.109]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[00:56:20.109 --> 00:56:24.373]  They point out one of our evils so they can advert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[00:56:24.933 --> 00:56:26.694]  A global permanent lockdown is here.
[00:56:26.694 --> 00:56:30.077]  It's already causing millions and millions to starve to death.
[00:56:30.077 --> 00:56:32.258]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[00:56:32.258 --> 00:56:40.103]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[00:56:40.103 --> 00:56:40.904]  That's the facts.
[00:56:40.904 --> 00:56:46.608]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[00:56:46.608 --> 00:56:49.210]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:58.831 --> 00:57:01.552]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:57:01.552 --> 00:57:06.215]  It's time for you to choose a side.
[00:57:06.215 --> 00:57:07.575]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:57:20.004 --> 00:57:21.605]  Well, it's official, America.
[00:57:21.605 --> 00:57:27.728]  Joe Biden has just been declared the first blatantly fraudulent President-elect of America.
[00:57:27.728 --> 00:57:35.132]  Joe Biden is now President-elect Joe Biden, and Senator Kamala Harris is now Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.
[00:57:35.132 --> 00:57:37.674]  It's probably a good time for Republicans to learn how to pronounce her name.
[00:57:37.674 --> 00:57:40.495]  This process has been tainted.
[00:57:40.495 --> 00:57:43.837]  And if you taint it for one party, you taint it for the other party.
[00:57:43.837 --> 00:57:47.859]  If you taint it for one America, then you taint it for all America.
[00:57:47.859 --> 00:57:49.060]  And we're not going to stand for this.
[00:57:49.901 --> 00:57:59.866]  What damage do you think that Trump will do between losing the election and the swearing, the inauguration of Joe Biden?
[00:57:59.866 --> 00:58:04.188]  Maybe you didn't phrase it quite that way, but that's how I heard it.
[00:58:04.188 --> 00:58:06.409]  And we knew that he would be up to mischief.
[00:58:07.734 --> 00:58:21.013]  Separate and apart from trying to destroy the credibility of our elections, which we criticize other nations for doing, and now with all enemies, foreign and domestic, making assault on our elections.
[00:58:21.013 --> 00:58:22.635]  Well, we have one domestic.
[00:58:22.635 --> 00:58:23.557]  But apart from that,
[00:58:23.877 --> 00:58:34.828]  The word transparency gets kicked around a lot, but there is nothing transparent about the disgraceful 2020 election process that blatantly crushed the will of the American people.
[00:58:34.828 --> 00:58:38.012]  As expected, those votes did indeed close the gap for Joe Biden.
[00:58:38.012 --> 00:58:42.276]  Also, the numbers coming out of Green Bay, Wisconsin, went in favor of Joe Biden.
[00:58:42.276 --> 00:58:45.019]  They are still not in compliance!
[00:58:46.629 --> 00:58:48.030]  Our votes are being suppressed.
[00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:50.932]  We cannot count the votes properly.
[00:58:50.932 --> 00:59:04.101]  What's happening is they have moved the barrier up to six feet, but they took away the ballot machines that were in the front row and moved them to the back of the building.
[00:59:04.101 --> 00:59:06.123]  The court order is in effect.
[00:59:06.123 --> 00:59:11.887]  They will not give us access and the sheriff has decided not to come down here to enforce that court order.
[00:59:12.352 --> 00:59:16.536]  We're there, supposedly observing, but we can't see.
[00:59:16.536 --> 00:59:21.200]  We're further away than I am from you all here.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:25.323]  At least 100 feet away from open ballots that go back out of our sight.
[00:59:25.323 --> 00:59:26.404]  We can't see them.
[00:59:26.404 --> 00:59:28.786]  We don't know what's happening to them.
[00:59:28.786 --> 00:59:34.151]  It's just, there's no way for us to meaningfully observe the process from where they have us.
[00:59:34.151 --> 00:59:39.796]  Tell us how many ballots approximately went through that process that you had no chance to observe?
[00:59:40.991 --> 00:59:45.594]  Based on the counts that we've heard, it's about 125,000, maybe more.
[00:59:45.594 --> 00:59:57.220]  The mummy Biden rose from his slumber to remind the American public of his insolence, fumbling giant words on the teleprompter in front of a crowd of corporacratic ghost jeeps.
[00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:59.522]  I know watching these vote tallies on TV,
[01:00:00.282 --> 01:00:19.786]  Moves very slow and it's... Speaking of ghosts, of the many things Biden didn't mention was the overwhelming evidence of a ghost in the machine, as Dominion Software, the second largest seller of voting machines, flooded our national election with glitches favoring Joe Biden.
[01:00:19.786 --> 01:00:29.608]  In Antrim County, ballots were counted for Democrats that were meant for Republicans, causing a 6,000 vote swing against our candidates.
[01:00:30.771 --> 01:00:38.395]  The county clerk came forward and said tabulating software glitched and caused a miscalculation of the votes.
[01:00:38.395 --> 01:00:46.380]  Since then, we have now discovered that 47 counties use this same software in the same capacity.
[01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:49.779]  And there is also Benford's Law.
[01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:55.963]  It has been used in criminal cases regarding election fraud in the United States at the federal, state, and local levels.
[01:00:55.963 --> 01:01:00.367]  The law detected ballot stuffing in the 2009 Iranian elections.
[01:01:00.367 --> 01:01:10.334]  And the Washington Post reported on the instance of the 2016 Russian election conforming purposefully to Benford's Law in order to hide vote rigging.
[01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:12.296]  I've been active in this since 1958.
[01:01:12.296 --> 01:01:12.696]  That's 62 years.
[01:01:16.112 --> 01:01:21.857]  I am the angriest I have been in that entire six decades.
[01:01:21.857 --> 01:01:37.831]  You have a group of corrupt people who have absolute contempt for the American people, who believe that we are so spineless, so cowardly, so unwilling to stand up for ourselves, that they can steal the presidency.
[01:01:37.831 --> 01:01:42.175]  And we'll wring our hands, bring in a few lawyers, and do nothing.
[01:01:43.035 --> 01:01:47.516]  The videos of incidents of potential fraud... We've got the rest of this powerful report when we come back.
[01:01:47.516 --> 01:01:51.598]  Stay with us.
[01:01:51.598 --> 01:01:52.638]  DNA Force Plus.
[01:01:52.638 --> 01:01:56.899]  If you did one thing for your immune system, it would be get all the essential things.
[01:01:56.899 --> 01:01:59.240]  And that's the clean iodine, X2 or X3.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.861]  That's the biotrichoselenium.
[01:02:00.861 --> 01:02:02.381]  That is the vitamin D3.
[01:02:02.381 --> 01:02:04.062]  That is the C. That is the zinc.
[01:02:04.062 --> 01:02:06.502]  There's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential without them you die.
[01:02:06.502 --> 01:02:07.923]  And studies show you really need the other ones too.
[01:02:08.243 --> 01:02:09.544]  But DNA Force goes beyond that.
[01:02:09.544 --> 01:02:21.116]  It helps get all that in the cells and out the cells with PQQ and CoQ10 of the highest quality sources with other ingredients that clean out the cells that unclog them so all that stuff can get in.
[01:02:21.116 --> 01:02:22.178]  Viruses don't get in.
[01:02:22.178 --> 01:02:23.199]  The good stuff gets in.
[01:02:23.199 --> 01:02:27.243]  As the NIH website says, if you have all the proper things, they can't replicate like they could.
[01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:28.884]  I do this because it's essential.
[01:02:28.884 --> 01:02:29.945]  Like oxygen, like water.
[01:02:29.945 --> 01:02:32.086]  DNA Force sold out for months.
[01:02:32.086 --> 01:02:33.247]  50% off out of the gates.
[01:02:33.247 --> 01:02:34.288]  Triple Patriot Points.
[01:02:34.288 --> 01:02:35.149]  Free shipping.
[01:02:35.149 --> 01:02:36.570]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:38.051]  DNA Force Election Special.
[01:02:38.051 --> 01:02:39.012]  That's going to have to end in a week.
[01:02:39.012 --> 01:02:41.874]  We've got a limited supply and it was very hard to get the PQQ this time.
[01:02:41.874 --> 01:02:43.375]  A lot of our stuff can't get anymore.
[01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:45.416]  A lot of our products because the supply chain's broken down.
[01:02:45.416 --> 01:02:46.477]  That's part of the Global's plan.
[01:02:46.477 --> 01:02:47.738]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:02:47.738 --> 01:02:49.259]  I want to thank you all for tuning in.
[01:03:09.514 --> 01:03:21.209]  Very powerful John Bowne report up on InfoWars.com and I've got more big breaking news on their plans to blame President Trump for the whole COVID lockdown and everything else which they are behind coming up.
[01:03:21.209 --> 01:03:24.513]  But let's just go ahead and go to the rest of this important John Bowne report.
[01:03:24.513 --> 01:03:27.757]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:03:27.757 --> 01:03:28.378]  And do nothing.
[01:03:29.246 --> 01:03:38.213]  The videos of incidents of potential fraud poured in on social media as Silicon Valley did all they could to stop it.
[01:03:38.213 --> 01:03:45.319]  I'm not going to show the name because the boss is here and don't want us to, you know, and I can't take it.
[01:03:45.319 --> 01:03:47.621]  They won't let me.
[01:03:47.621 --> 01:03:52.445]  President Donald Trump.
[01:03:52.445 --> 01:03:54.467]  And not the only one we found in the trash.
[01:03:55.527 --> 01:04:07.791]  Now I am examining this ballot that was received by a Queens Village resident, and with all of the Democrat candidates pre-filled in on the ballot.
[01:04:07.791 --> 01:04:10.131]  A lot of people wanted to know, how did it get pre-filled in?
[01:04:10.131 --> 01:04:11.092]  Was it done by pen?
[01:04:11.092 --> 01:04:11.952]  Was it done by hand?
[01:04:11.952 --> 01:04:20.654]  As I put my hand over every one of the pre-filled in Democrats here on the ballot, I can see it was definitely not done by hand.
[01:04:20.654 --> 01:04:22.335]  It looks like it was done maybe by a stamper.
[01:04:23.565 --> 01:04:26.586]  Or a machine, maybe it was run through a machine.
[01:04:26.586 --> 01:04:30.267]  This is a two page absentee ballot.
[01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:32.627]  Now this is the envelope that it came in.
[01:04:32.627 --> 01:04:34.328]  Also incredibly official looking.
[01:04:34.328 --> 01:04:35.348]  It says it's official.
[01:04:35.348 --> 01:04:37.868]  Official absentee ballot envelope.
[01:04:37.868 --> 01:04:40.109]  And it is in several different languages.
[01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:42.429]  And it has a barcode as you can see.
[01:04:42.429 --> 01:04:44.330]  The voter ID number.
[01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:46.350]  Oh my God.
[01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:46.470]  Hi.
[01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:47.431]  So you with the elections?
[01:04:47.431 --> 01:04:48.531]  You're the Bureau of Elections, right?
[01:04:49.674 --> 01:04:51.735]  Well, I mean, I'm just a volunteer.
[01:04:51.735 --> 01:04:55.197]  We're just wondering what, okay, I understand you're a volunteer and you're just doing your job.
[01:04:55.197 --> 01:04:55.717]  What's all these?
[01:04:55.717 --> 01:04:58.038]  Are these mail-in ballots or what's these coming in?
[01:04:58.038 --> 01:04:58.618]  What are these?
[01:04:58.618 --> 01:04:59.278]  Uh-huh.
[01:04:59.278 --> 01:05:00.839]  These are my intake here?
[01:05:00.839 --> 01:05:01.299]  What's that?
[01:05:01.299 --> 01:05:02.120]  My intake as well?
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:07.402]  Yeah, because we're wondering why are ballots being handled down here and not up there with the elections?
[01:05:07.402 --> 01:05:08.723]  So we're curious about that.
[01:05:08.723 --> 01:05:12.525]  Okay, yeah, the gentleman who's in charge of this I think should be right back down.
[01:05:12.525 --> 01:05:14.025]  What's his name?
[01:05:14.025 --> 01:05:15.326]  Um, gosh, what is his name?
[01:05:18.559 --> 01:05:20.400]  The order's pretty clear.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.462]  I've been a lawyer for 30 years.
[01:05:22.462 --> 01:05:24.604]  What can you tell us what's unclear about it?
[01:05:24.604 --> 01:05:27.046]  You're a private lawyer and acting in a government capacity.
[01:05:27.046 --> 01:05:27.326]  Great.
[01:05:27.326 --> 01:05:29.068]  They're evaluating a judge's order?
[01:05:34.232 --> 01:05:36.894]  The order is currently in effect.
[01:05:36.894 --> 01:05:38.876]  I don't understand why eight attorneys
[01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:55.307]  I did it all by myself.
[01:05:55.307 --> 01:06:08.512]  It says that no later than 1030 today, you're to follow the election code and my people, my clients, representatives, are to be within six feet of the province.
[01:06:08.512 --> 01:06:13.454]  We have read the orders and we are complying with the orders and we will discuss it with you in a bit.
[01:06:13.874 --> 01:06:26.039]  While the Stop the Steal Facebook group was removed, one of the fastest growing groups in Facebook's history, representing Americans merely trying to get to the bottom of what they were seeing.
[01:06:26.039 --> 01:06:30.861]  Regardless of the bag of goods the Mockingbird Media wants America to swallow.
[01:06:30.861 --> 01:06:32.481]  We just haven't seen it.
[01:06:32.481 --> 01:06:33.862]  You know, it hasn't been presented.
[01:06:33.862 --> 01:06:36.203]  There's all kinds of stuff flying on the internet.
[01:06:36.203 --> 01:06:38.964]  But when we look into it, it doesn't pan out.
[01:06:39.344 --> 01:06:45.889]  Just a week ago, Washington Post and ABC News put out a poll, and let's make sure that we realize these are major platforms, okay?
[01:06:45.889 --> 01:06:48.731]  This is the Washington Post of Watergate fame.
[01:06:48.731 --> 01:06:52.054]  It's also owned by Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world.
[01:06:52.054 --> 01:06:55.457]  ABC News, top-rated newscast in America.
[01:06:55.457 --> 01:06:58.779]  They put out a poll that said Biden was going to win Wisconsin by 17%.
[01:06:58.779 --> 01:07:03.123]  Now, to get this number correct, we have to move the decimal not once,
[01:07:03.703 --> 01:07:12.310]  We have to move to the decimal twice to get in the vicinity of what's actually going on in Wisconsin because right now the current actual is Joe Biden up by 0.6%.
[01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:17.234]  And I say current because we have not accepted that as final and there will be a recount.
[01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:20.737]  But the more important takeaway here is that this is not just a mistake.
[01:07:21.257 --> 01:07:22.897]  This is disinformation.
[01:07:22.897 --> 01:07:29.519]  This is propaganda meant to suppress the Trump vote, meant to depress Trump supporters in Wisconsin.
[01:07:29.519 --> 01:07:30.599]  This is willful.
[01:07:30.599 --> 01:07:34.320]  This is a decision to try to put their thumbs on the scale.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:50.843]  So we need to be aware of it and you need to be incredibly skeptical during this contentious time in our country of anything that you hear from these legacy media platforms like the Washington Post and ABC and like Fox News and AP trying to get you to believe fake news that Arizona is decided.
[01:07:51.499 --> 01:08:00.609]  There are far too many questions surrounding the nebulous explanation of how the historically fraudulent election process transpired.
[01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:03.412]  Why was voting stopped in five or six states?
[01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:07.236]  I think it was actually five states and six cities for four hours.
[01:08:07.236 --> 01:08:10.360]  You know, why are ballots showing up?
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:11.560]  So, mail-in voting.
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:12.801]  It has a lot of problems.
[01:08:12.801 --> 01:08:14.201]  You know, some obvious ones.
[01:08:14.201 --> 01:08:16.181]  You send ballots out to everyone.
[01:08:16.181 --> 01:08:18.962]  You never know who actually receives the ballot when they come back.
[01:08:18.962 --> 01:08:21.162]  You could be sending them to people who have died without knowing it.
[01:08:21.162 --> 01:08:24.103]  You could be sending them to people who have moved from the state.
[01:08:24.103 --> 01:08:27.624]  So, that already has a problem, but there should be one advantage, right?
[01:08:27.624 --> 01:08:34.566]  If these things are mailed in, presumably, some of them will come in late, but wouldn't most of them be coming in months or weeks ahead of time?
[01:08:34.566 --> 01:08:40.107]  So, why are we finding big tranches of ballots, hours, and in some cases even
[01:08:40.587 --> 01:08:43.709]  More days after the polls have closed.
[01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:47.252]  Shouldn't mail-in ballots already be there somewhere ready to be counted?
[01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:50.214]  It was at about 4 a.m.
[01:08:50.214 --> 01:08:52.215]  that three vehicles arrived.
[01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:56.138]  A van, a Chrysler 300, and a Ferrari with 130,000 plus ballots.
[01:09:04.275 --> 01:09:08.618]  He said he was astonished as they started counting the ballots.
[01:09:08.618 --> 01:09:20.744]  He was astonished that every single ballot, like literally 100% of that 130,000 ballots, were all Biden ballots.
[01:09:20.744 --> 01:09:24.106]  We wouldn't accept these election results from a banana republic.
[01:09:24.106 --> 01:09:30.930]  How are the American people going to be asked to accept these results when we don't have basic protocols for democracy in place?
[01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:32.331]  I've never seen anything like it.
[01:09:32.671 --> 01:09:37.114]  In Arizona, the media determined the outcome and never walked it back.
[01:09:37.114 --> 01:09:48.022]  If the current trends continue as we have seen, because we follow the science, President Trump is going to overtake Joe Biden and we are going to win Arizona.
[01:09:48.022 --> 01:09:52.144]  Fox News declared Joe Biden the winner but was swiftly corrected.
[01:09:52.144 --> 01:09:57.388]  Regardless, the legacy media propaganda mafia never corrected the election map.
[01:09:57.668 --> 01:10:07.632]  Congresswoman, and I know you've been very vocal and there have been people all over the place have been very vocal about our decision desk and the call that they made on election night.
[01:10:07.632 --> 01:10:17.697]  They stand by that call as of right now and they say that the votes will not, the remaining vote, will not go to the percentage that he needs it to go.
[01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:27.793]  So, here in Arizona, one of the biggest issues that we have right now is the use of a Sharpie pen that was used at the different polling places.
[01:10:27.793 --> 01:10:37.277]  On the Democrats' own website here in Arizona, they actually say, do not use red ink or permanent marker because this may result in a false read by the ballot machines.
[01:10:37.277 --> 01:10:39.017]  So that comes from their own website.
[01:10:39.017 --> 01:10:43.559]  So when we showed up to polling stations, they only gave us Sharpie markers.
[01:10:44.259 --> 01:10:48.582]  I specifically said I don't want to use a sharpie marker, do you have a regular pen?
[01:10:48.582 --> 01:11:06.193]  We interviewed witnesses, like 15 of them that this happened to, and then we got the county clerk in Maricopa County on video, this is on Band-Odd Video, two days ago, three days ago, to admit that you're not supposed to use sharpies, but they're calling a conspiracy theory.
[01:11:06.193 --> 01:11:07.334]  I mean, I went there.
[01:11:08.962 --> 01:11:10.263]  I did the interviews.
[01:11:10.263 --> 01:11:11.124]  We got the footage.
[01:11:11.124 --> 01:11:13.827]  We got the footage from others that interviewed the county clerk.
[01:11:13.827 --> 01:11:15.249]  And she's admitting all of this.
[01:11:15.249 --> 01:11:15.830]  And here's the deal.
[01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:18.713]  I've been airing a lot of tapes today because...
[01:11:21.415 --> 01:11:24.316]  I'm officially choking on air at this point, okay?
[01:11:24.316 --> 01:11:27.156]  And it's not because I can't handle the threat of the globalists.
[01:11:27.156 --> 01:11:27.957]  I love my crew.
[01:11:27.957 --> 01:11:34.578]  It's that we're all stressed out, and we're all over the edge, and a lot of the crew's being more professional than I am.
[01:11:34.578 --> 01:11:37.839]  Some of the crew's being as big of a jerk as I am.
[01:11:37.839 --> 01:11:39.699]  I know exactly their damn game plan.
[01:11:39.699 --> 01:11:41.400]  I know how to beat them.
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.820]  And then I'm telling myself, I could probably do more good.
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.461]  The audience is great.
[01:11:45.461 --> 01:11:45.901]  On the phone.
[01:11:46.846 --> 01:11:55.453]  I need to go in my office and beg, and then get a hold of Don Jr., and then get the President on the phone, and then hope he listens to me about this stuff.
[01:11:55.453 --> 01:12:02.259]  And there's nothing more frustrating than missing phone calls from the President, and I'm just sick of it all!
[01:12:02.259 --> 01:12:03.220]  I'm sick of it!
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:11.607]  I mean, we should not be battling a meth-head, devil-worshipper, crypt-keeper, and his demon son, and his demon family.
[01:12:11.607 --> 01:12:12.588]  We shouldn't be here!
[01:12:13.697 --> 01:12:19.361]  We shouldn't have let him commit all these crimes for Chinese agents publicly.
[01:12:19.361 --> 01:12:22.402]  So the truth is, I'm going crazy.
[01:12:22.402 --> 01:12:25.824]  Because this isn't the Democrats taking over.
[01:12:25.824 --> 01:12:30.567]  They're going to end the country with an endless lockdown and it's over for us, okay?
[01:12:30.567 --> 01:12:32.409]  And so that's what I'm frustrated about.
[01:12:32.409 --> 01:12:34.550]  I'm not happy that everything I said came true.
[01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:38.172]  I'm not happy that, oh my God, Alex Jones was right, isn't he great?
[01:12:38.172 --> 01:12:39.693]  That is the sickest thing ever.
[01:12:39.693 --> 01:12:41.194]  I am not happy about being right.
[01:12:47.346 --> 01:12:49.871]  When we come back, Owen Stroyer's got a plan to take action.
[01:12:49.871 --> 01:12:54.381]  Stay with us.
[01:12:54.381 --> 01:12:56.646]  The days of hell.
[01:12:56.646 --> 01:12:57.748]  The nightmare is here.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.762]  79 days of hell has begun!
[01:13:02.762 --> 01:13:22.649]  Multinational corporations, the mainstream media apparatus, and social media tech giants are all now being deployed by the archaic inbred crooked establishment to interfere with the 2020 US elections, remove the populist champion of the people, Donald J. Trump,
[01:13:23.209 --> 01:13:34.092]  And install the decrepit, perverted, traitorous establishment puppet Joe Biden, along with rabid radical hag Kamala Harris.
[01:13:34.092 --> 01:13:41.274]  Keep your heads on a swivel and tune in to 79days.news for tomorrow's news today.
[01:13:41.274 --> 01:13:44.154]  79days.news, America's last stand.
[01:13:44.154 --> 01:13:44.874]  79days.news.
[01:13:51.075 --> 01:13:53.355]  Talk about tomorrow's news today.
[01:13:53.355 --> 01:13:56.536]  This is all very transparent when you war game it out.
[01:13:56.536 --> 01:14:02.197]  Six months ago, InfoWars predicted that the mail-in ballots would be used to steal the election from Trump.
[01:14:02.197 --> 01:14:10.239]  They would simply pause the voting at night and then have an unlimited number that they had in reserve to bring forward in battleground states to secure the victory.
[01:14:10.239 --> 01:14:11.359]  And now that happened.
[01:14:11.359 --> 01:14:16.380]  Now, what else did I predict a few months ago and again last week and again last night, all on record?
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.481]  That when Joe Biden was president-elect,
[01:14:19.361 --> 01:14:19.581]  Yeah.
[01:14:53.653 --> 01:14:56.280]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:17.808 --> 01:15:30.841]  All right, Alex Jones here back live and I intend to be here tonight on the nighttime show seven to nine with Dionne Lorraine and everybody else and we got a big announcement here to make.
[01:15:30.841 --> 01:15:34.205]  I got a call from some folks wanting us to do a caravan.
[01:15:36.618 --> 01:15:36.878]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:57.725 --> 01:15:59.646]  And then later, you did a great job.
[01:15:59.646 --> 01:16:06.088]  I was watching you last night on Sunday Live, and I was like, this is the best radio ever.
[01:16:06.088 --> 01:16:08.529]  I got home, we had the iPad out, we were eating dinner.
[01:16:08.529 --> 01:16:09.229]  Thank you.
[01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:10.690]  Myself, my wife, everybody, we watched it.
[01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:11.810]  You were doing your whole NPR thing.
[01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:12.431]  Thank you very much.
[01:16:12.431 --> 01:16:16.112]  We're going to do that again, we're going to do that again, we're going to do that again, last segment of this hour.
[01:16:16.112 --> 01:16:21.294]  But let's just get into the big picture about Biden and what's happening and the latest numbers.
[01:16:21.294 --> 01:16:22.655]  We've got them all right here, Owen.
[01:16:22.655 --> 01:16:23.315]  Your take on things.
[01:16:24.721 --> 01:16:39.130]  Well, what I'm noticing, mainstream conservatives that you wouldn't normally think would go out on the fringe of conspiracy or theories or would even dare to say, you know, I don't trust the results of the election or I don't trust TV news,
[01:16:40.188 --> 01:16:45.332]  Those people are starting to kind of flip the switch and they're scratching their heads and they're saying, well, this is odd.
[01:16:45.332 --> 01:16:47.874]  I mean, I can look at the graph in Michigan.
[01:16:47.874 --> 01:16:50.096]  I can look at the graph in Wisconsin.
[01:16:50.096 --> 01:16:51.437]  I can look at the graph in Pennsylvania.
[01:16:51.437 --> 01:16:52.898]  I can look at all these anomalies.
[01:16:52.898 --> 01:16:57.021]  I can look at all the videos and it's just not being reported on TV.
[01:16:57.021 --> 01:16:58.682]  And you'd think this is the biggest story going.
[01:16:59.483 --> 01:17:01.245]  Why isn't it being reported on TV?
[01:17:01.245 --> 01:17:08.473]  So it's that switch being flicked in their heads and then they're realizing that, oh wait, maybe the TV isn't there to inform me.
[01:17:08.473 --> 01:17:10.315]  Maybe the TV news was never there to inform me.
[01:17:10.315 --> 01:17:14.060]  It was there to keep me uninformed, misinformed, and confused.
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:24.926]  And right now, where it stands, we're seeing the separation of the patriots who are going to fight with Donald Trump, some names I think we may be shocked by, and then the people that are going to abandon Trump at this stage.
[01:17:24.926 --> 01:17:25.766]  That's the level we're at.
[01:17:25.766 --> 01:17:29.809]  We knew that this was coming, we knew they were going to steal it, and so now we're
[01:17:30.549 --> 01:17:38.093]  Either meeting this hour, we're meeting this arena, we're coming together to fight this, or you'll see people abandoning Trump.
[01:17:38.093 --> 01:17:38.914]  But we can't abandon Trump.
[01:17:38.914 --> 01:17:40.935]  I'm not abandoning, but I am starting to go crazy.
[01:17:40.935 --> 01:17:43.377]  Like, I'm going to be honest, I've always been able to handle stress.
[01:17:43.377 --> 01:17:58.345]  At this point, this is so over the top, a communist takeover, Biden stumbling around with his corrupt son on TV, the open stealing, the graphs that aren't organic, that show the fixes in, the total censorship, and it's surreal, it's otherworldly.
[01:17:58.345 --> 01:17:59.226]  This is Twilight Zone.
[01:17:59.366 --> 01:18:04.110]  Yeah, you got humans walking around in face masks like they're on a foreign planet or something.
[01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:09.695]  They had an article in Atlantic Monthly that Joe Biden does touch children.
[01:18:09.695 --> 01:18:10.695]  It's like Christ.
[01:18:10.695 --> 01:18:12.036]  It's a sacrament.
[01:18:12.036 --> 01:18:14.939]  I mean, there's no end to this.
[01:18:14.939 --> 01:18:18.662]  A gibbering person with strokes that can barely talk?
[01:18:18.662 --> 01:18:21.584]  A Chi-Com operative, they say, is our president?
[01:18:21.584 --> 01:18:22.845]  I mean, what?
[01:18:22.845 --> 01:18:24.707]  This is unbelievable.
[01:18:24.707 --> 01:18:26.088]  This is not going to stand.
[01:18:26.088 --> 01:18:27.950]  And then again, I wish he was a normal Democrat.
[01:18:28.690 --> 01:18:30.472]  I wish he wasn't a CHICOM agent.
[01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:32.193]  And then, okay, Trump's gone.
[01:18:32.193 --> 01:18:33.935]  I almost have gone bankrupt under Trump.
[01:18:33.935 --> 01:18:35.456]  I've been persecuted under Trump.
[01:18:35.456 --> 01:18:36.397]  I like what Trump's done.
[01:18:36.397 --> 01:18:40.781]  I think he's a good guy, but it's not a bit of bed of roses, folks, being associated with Trump.
[01:18:40.781 --> 01:18:42.642]  But man, I'm more behind Trump now than ever.
[01:18:42.642 --> 01:18:43.303]  What about you, Owen?
[01:18:44.383 --> 01:18:48.946]  Yeah, and I'm going to be more behind him for the next, I guess, 72 days.
[01:18:48.946 --> 01:19:01.334]  And he better rise to the occasion in the next 72 days and save this republic, or his name is going to be, you know, not the gold emblem on the side of his buildings and his airplanes.
[01:19:01.334 --> 01:19:02.375]  It's sadly going to be mine.
[01:19:03.235 --> 01:19:05.097]  S-H-I-T word.
[01:19:05.097 --> 01:19:08.799]  By the way, did we not call it the 72 days, the 79 days of hell?
[01:19:08.799 --> 01:19:10.060]  I mean, we have just nailed it.
[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:15.744]  And the problem is, Owen, I can see all the next moves going 50 years out, and it's the end of our species.
[01:19:15.744 --> 01:19:19.827]  I was telling my wife the other day for about an hour, she goes, yeah, it's like an alien takeover.
[01:19:19.827 --> 01:19:22.789]  I'm not saying it's aliens, but it's so anti-human.
[01:19:22.789 --> 01:19:23.650]  It destroys us.
[01:19:23.650 --> 01:19:24.490]  It makes us weak.
[01:19:24.490 --> 01:19:25.371]  It ends us.
[01:19:25.371 --> 01:19:27.012]  They admit that's the plan.
[01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:28.033]  It's what the Bible said.
[01:19:28.033 --> 01:19:29.313]  It's freaking Satan, man.
[01:19:29.313 --> 01:19:29.774]  It's Satan.
[01:19:31.038 --> 01:19:40.183]  Yeah, there's no doubt, and we're kind of one of the lone forts, if you will, standing against this, standing our post, manning our post, refusing to back down.
[01:19:40.183 --> 01:19:49.028]  And I'm glad, I'm glad that you're seeing Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani and Pam Bondi and General Flynn and these other people that are willing to stand by too.
[01:19:49.028 --> 01:19:54.791]  And, you know what, I understand Trump wanted to take a few days to maybe get Zen or work on some things behind the scenes, that's fine, but... Ted Cruz?
[01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:57.712]  Ted Cruz, and I mean even Lindsey Graham.
[01:19:57.712 --> 01:20:01.033]  I don't like Lindsey Graham, but he said we'll never win another presidency.
[01:20:01.033 --> 01:20:03.293]  He gets that this is a fundamental takeover.
[01:20:03.293 --> 01:20:05.134]  Yeah, this is not sharing power.
[01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:08.575]  This is a revolution by shy comms and globalists damn it.
[01:20:08.575 --> 01:20:15.077]  And I mean, I just physically all my ancestors all my DNA are just like my ancestors are like really upset really angry.
[01:20:15.077 --> 01:20:18.778]  My instincts are like, you know, it's time for games is over.
[01:20:18.778 --> 01:20:19.638]  That's why I'm so angry.
[01:20:19.638 --> 01:20:21.338]  I'm well, that's what I've been being mean.
[01:20:21.338 --> 01:20:22.499]  Well, the sad thing is
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:29.822]  It's like, you know, Kamala Harris in the Biden camp, like you see them dancing around, hopping around.
[01:20:29.822 --> 01:20:33.164]  Hillary Clinton put up a picture of Biden and Harris this morning.
[01:20:33.164 --> 01:20:34.484]  I guess they had some COVID meeting.
[01:20:34.484 --> 01:20:35.865]  I guess Hillary got to go to that too.
[01:20:35.865 --> 01:20:37.446]  How convenient for her.
[01:20:37.446 --> 01:20:41.828]  And it's a picture of Biden and Kamala, and it's a freeze frame of everything they're about.
[01:20:41.828 --> 01:20:47.631]  Kamala cackling like an evil witch and Biden looking like he doesn't even know where the sun rises.
[01:20:47.631 --> 01:20:50.112]  And that... And scared three-year-olds in masks.
[01:20:50.956 --> 01:20:51.816]  Yeah.
[01:20:51.816 --> 01:20:54.617]  Which is what child traffickers do when they put kids in masks.
[01:20:54.617 --> 01:20:55.957]  That helps them move the kids around.
[01:20:55.957 --> 01:21:01.399]  And so they're all dancing and hopping around as they're getting ready to end America and they think it's all a game.
[01:21:01.399 --> 01:21:05.140]  And then the average street liberal just goes along with it because they think it's fun and games too.
[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:07.920]  Like, oh ha ha, we beat you, ha ha.
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.981]  And they don't even realize how they're crapping their own pants.
[01:21:10.981 --> 01:21:12.701]  I mean, look at how fake they both are.
[01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.882]  They look like animatronic Chuck E. Cheese creatures.
[01:21:16.397 --> 01:21:21.683]  Well Alex, I'll tell you what, America's got 70 days to rise up against this.
[01:21:21.683 --> 01:21:24.325]  And I think it's going to happen.
[01:21:24.325 --> 01:21:26.888]  Oh, it's the fifth coup attempt?
[01:21:26.888 --> 01:21:29.010]  It's the fifth hoax attempt?
[01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:35.337]  I'm just, you know, my biggest concern right now is, I mean, once America's awakened and then
[01:21:37.071 --> 01:21:37.452]  We're good to go.
[01:21:52.495 --> 01:21:58.019]  Where, you know, I'm fighting Nazis, ha ha, ooh, I'm fighting racists, oh, big, look at me, I'm so virtuous.
[01:21:58.019 --> 01:22:03.322]  Oh, I've read some of the Twitters where they call for violence against you and I, and reconciliation commissions put us in prison.
[01:22:03.322 --> 01:22:09.066]  They're like, after the violence we've dealt with with Trump and his Nazi attacks on us, and it's all made up?
[01:22:09.066 --> 01:22:10.146]  They're the ones attacking us?
[01:22:10.146 --> 01:22:10.787]  It's crazy!
[01:22:11.027 --> 01:22:22.941]  It's complete reverse of reality and we knew that they would do this because these are Satan's foot soldiers and this is the psychological warfare of the left that the left currently indoctrinates.
[01:22:22.941 --> 01:22:26.445]  They totally immerse you in a false reality and then they hope... The prison of lies.
[01:22:28.063 --> 01:22:29.244]  We live in a prison of lies.
[01:22:44.585 --> 01:22:46.306]  Big announcement.
[01:22:46.306 --> 01:22:50.849]  I kind of feel guilty even sitting on this mission, but you've accepted it, and it's going to be insane.
[01:22:50.849 --> 01:22:59.675]  A giant caravan kicks off at 5, 530 today at the Texas State Capitol, right down by the governor's mansion in that parking lot.
[01:22:59.675 --> 01:23:03.438]  They're going to be telling us about the Stop the Steal Caravan to Washington, D.C.
[01:23:03.438 --> 01:23:06.640]  We'll have maps and more up in a few hours on Infowars.com.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.141]  This is all very impromptu.
[01:23:08.141 --> 01:23:09.322]  This is all very revolutionary.
[01:23:09.322 --> 01:23:09.963]  Tell us about it, Owen.
[01:23:10.643 --> 01:23:14.948]  So we are going to launch, as you said, tonight from the state capitol here in Austin, Texas.
[01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:18.593]  We're going to go, our first stop is going to be in Houston, Texas tonight.
[01:23:18.593 --> 01:23:20.255]  We'll probably get around there around 8.
[01:23:20.255 --> 01:23:22.637]  We're going to announce the location coming up.
[01:23:22.637 --> 01:23:25.441]  I believe it's going to be at Herman Square Park.
[01:23:25.441 --> 01:23:27.263]  Herman Square Park in Houston tonight at 8.
[01:23:27.263 --> 01:23:29.105]  So again, then we're going to be going down
[01:23:30.066 --> 01:23:31.047]  I-10 into Florida.
[01:23:31.047 --> 01:23:33.089]  We're going to stop in Tallahassee on Tuesday.
[01:23:33.089 --> 01:23:34.951]  We're going to go up through Georgia.
[01:23:34.951 --> 01:23:36.372]  Atlanta on Wednesday.
[01:23:36.372 --> 01:23:39.615]  We're going to be in North Carolina and Virginia on Thursday.
[01:23:39.615 --> 01:23:41.637]  And then Washington, D.C.
[01:23:41.637 --> 01:23:44.219]  Friday to link up with you, Alex.
[01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:45.500]  And we got a battle taking place.
[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:46.521]  Antifa attacks.
[01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:46.982]  That's right.
[01:23:46.982 --> 01:23:47.522]  Going to D.C.
[01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:48.043]  We're ready.
[01:23:48.043 --> 01:23:48.743]  We knew it was coming.
[01:23:48.743 --> 01:23:49.184]  Stay with us.
[01:23:50.024 --> 01:23:55.226]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when it comes to the show?
[01:23:55.226 --> 01:24:12.793]  And it's the fact that InfoWars, more than 25 years ago, doing basic research with what the Club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying, developed the hypothesis that communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[01:24:12.793 --> 01:24:14.074]  Well, now China owns the debt.
[01:24:14.074 --> 01:24:16.815]  Now China owns Hollywood, all the one-sided trading deals.
[01:24:17.555 --> 01:24:22.197]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on, but again, it wasn't that hard.
[01:24:22.197 --> 01:24:27.819]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still, others didn't want to focus on that issue.
[01:24:27.819 --> 01:24:32.341]  We did, and you focused on it by supporting us at InfoWars.
[01:24:32.341 --> 01:24:43.386]  So when you go to InfoWarsStore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world of what's really happening.
[01:24:43.386 --> 01:24:45.206]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[01:24:45.206 --> 01:24:46.227]  I want to thank you for your support.
[01:24:49.923 --> 01:24:56.308]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshipped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations.
[01:24:56.308 --> 01:25:00.251]  But with modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular.
[01:25:00.251 --> 01:25:07.257]  Its antioxidant effect, its anti-inflammatory effect, everything it does is simply amazing.
[01:25:07.257 --> 01:25:10.800]  And most turmerics out there are simply food products.
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:16.844]  They're 3-5% curcuminoid, but we have body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:25:17.745 --> 01:25:17.865]  Yeah.
[01:25:35.208 --> 01:25:35.828]  We're good to go.
[01:26:00.492 --> 01:26:04.795]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[01:26:04.795 --> 01:26:08.278]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[01:26:08.278 --> 01:26:11.560]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:15.103]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:17.345]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[01:26:17.345 --> 01:26:18.746]  I suggest Band.Video.
[01:26:19.426 --> 01:26:24.889]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[01:26:24.889 --> 01:26:33.374]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[01:26:33.374 --> 01:26:41.219]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want.
[01:26:41.219 --> 01:26:42.880]  Be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[01:26:51.852 --> 01:26:54.953]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:26:54.953 --> 01:26:56.373]  They lie!
[01:26:56.373 --> 01:26:57.173]  They cheat!
[01:26:57.173 --> 01:27:00.574]  They steal!
[01:27:00.574 --> 01:27:01.234]  They cover up!
[01:27:25.113 --> 01:27:25.954]  Let's go!
[01:27:25.954 --> 01:27:27.316]  Don't shout on me!
[01:27:27.316 --> 01:27:28.197]  Let's go!
[01:27:28.197 --> 01:27:30.380]  This man knows what's up.
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:31.241]  Where's Hunter?
[01:27:31.241 --> 01:27:31.561]  Let's go!
[01:27:31.561 --> 01:27:32.322]  Where's Hunter?
[01:27:32.322 --> 01:27:33.123]  Where's Hunter?
[01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:35.166]  Where's Hunter, bud?
[01:27:43.292 --> 01:27:46.575]  Tell him, hey, tell Alex we haven't forgot you, sir.
[01:27:46.575 --> 01:27:47.596]  We have not forgot you.
[01:27:47.596 --> 01:27:48.817]  We still watch you.
[01:27:48.817 --> 01:27:49.618]  We still love you.
[01:27:49.618 --> 01:27:50.679]  Don't go away.
[01:27:50.679 --> 01:27:51.500]  Don't sell out.
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.240]  Be there for us.
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:53.141]  Come on, Alex.
[01:27:53.141 --> 01:27:54.463]  Been with you for years, man.
[01:27:54.463 --> 01:27:59.387]  Thousands of people downtown Austin Saturday.
[01:27:59.387 --> 01:28:03.291]  We got your back.
[01:28:11.028 --> 01:28:11.208]  O.H.
[01:28:11.208 --> 01:28:12.489]  Troyer, you're awesome too!
[01:28:12.489 --> 01:28:13.269]  You guys are great!
[01:28:13.269 --> 01:28:14.290]  Keep America great!
[01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:15.130]  Fight for the battle!
[01:28:15.130 --> 01:28:16.251]  Fight for our Republic!
[01:28:16.251 --> 01:28:16.711]  Yes!
[01:28:16.711 --> 01:28:17.171]  Woo!
[01:28:17.171 --> 01:28:22.414]  By the way, I know Gerald Solente is great.
[01:28:22.414 --> 01:28:24.315]  I kind of flamed out like a race car driver.
[01:28:24.315 --> 01:28:26.196]  Blowing his engine first hours.
[01:28:26.196 --> 01:28:26.816]  I'm so upset.
[01:28:26.816 --> 01:28:27.376]  I'm so mad.
[01:28:27.376 --> 01:28:37.742]  I'm going to take about 15 minutes of that time so I can recap what Trump needs to do, how he needs to take action, the next big battle plan against him that he's got to go after now.
[01:28:39.247 --> 01:28:40.788]  And again, Trump gets it.
[01:28:40.788 --> 01:28:42.188]  That's why he launched rallies.
[01:28:42.188 --> 01:28:45.309]  That's why he launched a celebration to counter their PSYOP.
[01:28:45.309 --> 01:28:46.570]  We have some really great news.
[01:28:46.570 --> 01:28:52.032]  He needs to fire Fauci next before he's announced to be put on Joe Biden's task force.
[01:28:52.032 --> 01:28:57.214]  Trump says Defense Secretary Mark Esper has been terminated.
[01:28:57.214 --> 01:29:04.217]  When Trump said two months ago, stop teaching that George Washington's evil and America's inherently bad, the Pentagon will not teach the troops that.
[01:29:05.737 --> 01:29:08.780]  Esper said, we're going to continue that no matter what the President says.
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:14.685]  He should have fired his slimy little rat ass right then.
[01:29:14.685 --> 01:29:15.926]  But he didn't.
[01:29:15.926 --> 01:29:17.708]  Well, now he's taking action.
[01:29:17.708 --> 01:29:20.270]  President Trump has put out this tweet.
[01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:22.672]  He fires the Secretary of Defense.
[01:29:22.672 --> 01:29:25.235]  I am pleased to announce that Christopher C. Miller
[01:29:27.008 --> 01:29:33.675]  The highly respected director of National Counterterrorism Center, unanimously confirmed by the Senate, will be acting Secretary of Defense, effective immediately.
[01:29:33.675 --> 01:29:41.404]  So Trump's cleaning house now and putting the right people in, because I want to explain something as crystal clear as the bluest sky you ever saw.
[01:29:41.404 --> 01:29:48.232]  If Joe Biden was just a dirty socialist Democrat,
[01:29:49.497 --> 01:29:51.638]  And was just gonna, you know, try to loot some stuff.
[01:29:51.638 --> 01:29:53.078]  I wouldn't risk my life fighting him.
[01:29:53.078 --> 01:29:53.799]  I'd expose him.
[01:29:53.799 --> 01:29:54.979]  I'd work hard.
[01:29:54.979 --> 01:30:06.744]  Because he's a CHICOM agent, because they stole this election, and because they're connected to pedophilia and Epstein and the Clintons, and because they're so damn evil, I am... My body is beyond angry.
[01:30:06.744 --> 01:30:12.146]  It is... My body is angry at me that I'm not doing some things.
[01:30:12.146 --> 01:30:15.507]  And I'm having intense dreams of doing some things.
[01:30:15.507 --> 01:30:15.627]  And...
[01:30:16.894 --> 01:30:18.514]  But I'm smarter than that.
[01:30:18.514 --> 01:30:22.435]  We're going to beat them with information warfare in the long haul.
[01:30:22.435 --> 01:30:24.296]  But I know everybody's sick to their stomach.
[01:30:24.296 --> 01:30:26.096]  You can feel evil taking over.
[01:30:26.096 --> 01:30:27.717]  This is a very special country.
[01:30:27.717 --> 01:30:29.657]  It's dying right now.
[01:30:29.657 --> 01:30:31.417]  But we're going to stop it.
[01:30:31.417 --> 01:30:33.758]  And I'm going to be in D.C.
[01:30:33.758 --> 01:30:34.298]  later in the week.
[01:30:34.298 --> 01:30:35.158]  I'm going to be in D.C.
[01:30:35.158 --> 01:30:35.898]  this weekend.
[01:30:35.898 --> 01:30:38.059]  I'm going to got other stuff I'm not going to tell you about yet.
[01:30:38.059 --> 01:30:41.920]  You saw how I was in Austin and I was in Arizona and other areas.
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.300]  We're going to really bust our asses.
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:43.920]  We appreciate you.
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:45.121]  We pray for your support.
[01:30:45.121 --> 01:30:45.801]  But Owen Schroyer
[01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:47.976]  I called him yesterday.
[01:30:47.976 --> 01:30:49.037]  He's working even harder than I have.
[01:30:49.037 --> 01:30:53.481]  And I said, will you plan this and take this over with Tim, our great security head?
[01:30:53.481 --> 01:30:55.403]  And they've done a great job.
[01:30:55.403 --> 01:30:56.944]  And again, this is at your own risk.
[01:30:56.944 --> 01:30:58.386]  And by that, there's no orders from headquarters.
[01:30:58.386 --> 01:30:59.327]  We're not going to coordinate you.
[01:30:59.327 --> 01:31:00.548]  I can tell you what to do.
[01:31:00.548 --> 01:31:01.849]  The convoy is going to go pretty slow.
[01:31:01.849 --> 01:31:03.671]  It's going to stop a few times a day so you can
[01:31:04.051 --> 01:31:04.912]  You know, meet up with it.
[01:31:04.912 --> 01:31:13.497]  But if tens of thousands of cars join us, and the truckers shut down D.C., like they're already saying, and we use this as a focal point to get other caravans going to D.C.
[01:31:13.497 --> 01:31:16.619]  this Saturday, and to hit this Friday, it's going to change the world.
[01:31:16.619 --> 01:31:18.961]  So now's the time to take action, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:18.961 --> 01:31:19.681]  It leaves at 5.30 today.
[01:31:21.417 --> 01:31:27.301]  Right there at that parking lot by the Governor's Mansion right in front of the Texas Capitol at 11th Street and Congress.
[01:31:27.301 --> 01:31:29.782]  Owen Schroer, tell us what's coming up.
[01:31:29.782 --> 01:31:42.991]  So what we have here is kind of just a basic map of what we're going to be doing here on the Stop the Steal Caravan and follow on Parler on Parler at Stop the Steal Caravan at Stop the Steal Caravan.
[01:31:42.991 --> 01:31:46.033]  You'll see a picture of me pointing my finger at the screen.
[01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:48.214]  We need you to help us stop the steal.
[01:31:48.214 --> 01:31:49.155]  So yes, today
[01:31:49.895 --> 01:31:50.855]  At 5 p.m.
[01:31:50.855 --> 01:31:53.476]  here, this is very advanced technology here, okay?
[01:31:53.476 --> 01:31:55.096]  Now this is very advanced.
[01:31:55.096 --> 01:31:59.098]  We're gonna be taking off from Austin, Texas at the Capitol at 5 p.m.
[01:31:59.098 --> 01:32:00.658]  and we're gonna be getting into Houston.
[01:32:00.658 --> 01:32:07.580]  We haven't decided on a final location, we're still deciding on a park, but there'll be a park we meet at tonight in Houston at 8 p.m.
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:13.861]  and as soon as I get out of the studio, I'm gonna... By the way, you're such a millennial that you think it's embarrassing it's not a high-tech screen.
[01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:14.402]  I love this!
[01:32:14.402 --> 01:32:14.982]  What are you talking about?
[01:32:14.982 --> 01:32:15.482]  I like it better!
[01:32:16.202 --> 01:32:17.904]  I wasn't being sarcastic.
[01:32:17.904 --> 01:32:19.825]  I'm one of the good Millennials.
[01:32:19.825 --> 01:32:21.747]  I'm one of the good Millennials, okay?
[01:32:21.747 --> 01:32:23.148]  I'm not one of the brainwashed Millennials.
[01:32:23.148 --> 01:32:23.728]  I'm just teasing.
[01:32:23.728 --> 01:32:24.109]  Start over.
[01:32:24.109 --> 01:32:25.130]  I don't watch the Kardashians.
[01:32:25.130 --> 01:32:25.610]  Okay.
[01:32:25.610 --> 01:32:26.391]  So anyway.
[01:32:26.391 --> 01:32:29.453]  So we're taking off from the Capitol here in Austin, 5 p.m.
[01:32:29.453 --> 01:32:33.577]  First meet-up is going to be in Houston tonight at 8 p.m.
[01:32:33.577 --> 01:32:39.341]  And again, follow at StopTheSteelCaravan on Parler where we're going to be putting out updates every hour on that.
[01:32:39.341 --> 01:32:40.622]  Is there a way to pull up Parler, Gus?
[01:32:41.323 --> 01:32:45.284]  Because I want to put it on screen, I'm not, I'm not, everybody's, we're working on it, alright.
[01:32:45.284 --> 01:32:47.245]  Put it in post then, okay?
[01:32:47.245 --> 01:32:47.665]  Go ahead.
[01:32:47.665 --> 01:33:02.590]  The next, the next stops, which are going to be on Tuesday, I imagine, and again, we're going to give updates on this, it's going to be kind of a working thing, times and locations, so make sure you follow for updates, and stay tuned to the Alex Jones Show, The War Room, and other things at Bandop Video.
[01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:06.952]  But I imagine when we go through Louisiana, we're going to be stopping in Baton Rouge,
[01:33:07.612 --> 01:33:14.214]  We're going to go down through the Gulf side and we're going to go all the way to Tallahassee and then Tuesday night in Tallahassee.
[01:33:14.214 --> 01:33:18.455]  Tuesday night in Tallahassee we will be having a Stop the Steal meet up.
[01:33:18.455 --> 01:33:19.456]  At the Capitol.
[01:33:19.456 --> 01:33:20.056]  Yes, right.
[01:33:20.056 --> 01:33:29.479]  And then on Wednesday... The big rally point is Tallahassee, like you're Colonel Jackson, you're rallying at Tallahassee at say 8 p.m.
[01:33:29.479 --> 01:33:30.179]  on Tuesday night.
[01:33:30.359 --> 01:33:30.920]  Yes.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:35.503]  And then Wednesday, we're going to make our way up to Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:33:35.503 --> 01:33:38.606]  And we'll have an event Wednesday in Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:33:38.606 --> 01:33:46.733]  And then depending on what the time looks like at that current stop, we may jump up to South Carolina too.
[01:33:46.733 --> 01:33:49.655]  But we'll definitely be in Atlanta, Georgia on Wednesday.
[01:33:49.655 --> 01:33:54.099]  And then Thursday, we're going to be making stops in North Carolina and Virginia.
[01:33:54.099 --> 01:33:55.380]  I think we'll do both the capitals.
[01:33:55.780 --> 01:34:01.364]  So, we'll do Raleigh, North Carolina, and we'll do Richmond, Virginia.
[01:34:01.364 --> 01:34:02.965]  That will be on Thursday.
[01:34:02.965 --> 01:34:06.767]  And then Friday, we will land in D.C.
[01:34:06.767 --> 01:34:10.210]  We will link up with the big man over here, Alex Jones.
[01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:11.551]  By big, I mean fat.
[01:34:11.551 --> 01:34:12.611]  The big pumpkin head.
[01:34:12.611 --> 01:34:13.632]  Hey, hey, let's get serious.
[01:34:13.632 --> 01:34:14.332]  Orange for pumpkins.
[01:34:14.332 --> 01:34:14.993]  And I'm not mad.
[01:34:14.993 --> 01:34:15.914]  You guys did this yesterday.
[01:34:15.914 --> 01:34:17.775]  It's great, but I just wanted the website on screen.
[01:34:17.775 --> 01:34:18.916]  That was my big fit earlier.
[01:34:19.816 --> 01:34:22.798]  So just over and over again for the radio audience so it actually has an effect.
[01:34:22.798 --> 01:34:23.818]  Give them the URL.
[01:34:23.818 --> 01:34:28.941]  Like, is Parler... I know we're on Parler, I know we're big on Parler, but is it hard to pull up Parler?
[01:34:28.941 --> 01:34:30.882]  No, there it is right there.
[01:34:30.882 --> 01:34:36.986]  Parler is the thing that Dan Bongino and others have made to compete with Twitter.
[01:34:36.986 --> 01:34:40.928]  And so we know we won't get banned there and that's why we're putting all of our information out on Parler.
[01:34:40.928 --> 01:34:41.989]  And he just launched it this morning.
[01:34:42.469 --> 01:34:43.869]  Just launched it this morning.
[01:34:43.869 --> 01:34:44.770]  And it's got 2,300 followers.
[01:34:44.770 --> 01:34:45.090]  That's right.
[01:34:45.090 --> 01:34:47.050]  And like I said, we should promote it on the Alex Jones Parlor.
[01:34:47.050 --> 01:34:48.390]  I know it was big as well.
[01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.771]  That's right.
[01:34:48.771 --> 01:34:49.251]  We got it.
[01:34:49.251 --> 01:34:51.991]  We just linked it up with all of our other accounts on Parlor.
[01:34:51.991 --> 01:34:57.553]  And so we're going to be funneling all information, direct information is going to be at StopTheSteelCaravan on Parlor.
[01:34:57.553 --> 01:35:02.414]  So again, folks, even if you can't be part of this and meet up with us, it doesn't matter.
[01:35:02.414 --> 01:35:07.115]  Promote it, follow it, pick up the streams, push it and say the Americans are coming.
[01:35:07.115 --> 01:35:09.075]  The cavalry is coming to back the president.
[01:35:09.075 --> 01:35:12.016]  This is really the American cavalry is coming to back Trump.
[01:35:12.096 --> 01:35:12.557]  That's it.
[01:35:12.557 --> 01:35:15.800]  And we're going to go right in, Saturday, right into that commie storm.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:16.861]  And I'm going to be there as well.
[01:35:16.861 --> 01:35:17.702]  So look at this, Alex.
[01:35:17.702 --> 01:35:20.586]  Again, starts at the capitol of Texas in Austin.
[01:35:20.586 --> 01:35:24.470]  Going to finish in Tuesday in Tallahassee at the capitol.
[01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:29.316]  Going to go to Georgia Wednesday, Raleigh, Richmond Thursday, and DC on Friday.
[01:35:29.316 --> 01:35:31.718]  And just like Robert E. Lee said, the volunteer Texans
[01:35:32.219 --> 01:35:35.481]  We're restoring the republic this time before our lovely Yankee president.
[01:35:35.481 --> 01:35:37.642]  We're coming from Texas with all the volunteers.
[01:35:37.642 --> 01:35:44.005]  Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia.
[01:35:44.005 --> 01:35:45.566]  Everybody get your ass to D.C.
[01:35:45.566 --> 01:35:46.186]  right now.
[01:35:46.186 --> 01:35:47.107]  This is the time to be there.
[01:35:47.267 --> 01:35:54.389]  And by the way, there's going to be a lot of people, I've already had people reach out to say, hey, I've got extra RVs, if people want to hop in my RV and join them too.
[01:35:54.389 --> 01:35:56.210]  Again, we're not coordinating as far as that.
[01:35:56.210 --> 01:35:59.671]  You're going to have to take care of your own, you know, staying and how you decide to drive and all that stuff.
[01:35:59.671 --> 01:36:02.672]  But we can give you... And it's okay, because they're going to drive slow in the swelling Lexus.
[01:36:02.672 --> 01:36:03.252]  And that's alright.
[01:36:03.612 --> 01:36:05.874]  At points, they're going to let you know where they're going to be.
[01:36:05.874 --> 01:36:11.457]  But make sure you're following on Parler at Stop the Steal Caravan, because I'm going to be doing all the communications through there.
[01:36:11.457 --> 01:36:17.381]  So if someone's like, hey, I got an RV, I'm in Tallahassee, I can take five, six people on board, I'll be putting that information out on Parler.
[01:36:17.381 --> 01:36:18.542]  But Alex, you really wanted this map.
[01:36:18.542 --> 01:36:18.923]  What do you think?
[01:36:18.923 --> 01:36:20.223]  I think it's beautiful.
[01:36:20.223 --> 01:36:21.624]  How about this, then, for you?
[01:36:21.624 --> 01:36:23.606]  All I want is a map on the website.
[01:36:23.606 --> 01:36:25.387]  You're doing great.
[01:36:25.387 --> 01:36:27.608]  That's for you, Alex.
[01:36:27.608 --> 01:36:29.890]  This is our Stop the Steal Caravan map.
[01:36:29.890 --> 01:36:31.051]  You love the fit I threw earlier.
[01:36:32.179 --> 01:36:36.223]  You guys have no idea what it's like wrangling a wild Alex Jones.
[01:36:36.223 --> 01:36:37.764]  That was not that bad.
[01:36:37.764 --> 01:36:41.668]  If it wasn't for the crew back there and myself and Daria... You were the one screaming.
[01:36:41.668 --> 01:36:45.131]  Get out of here because I'm pissed that the damn globe was stealing my election, Jones!
[01:36:45.131 --> 01:36:47.053]  They're not taking my election, Jones!
[01:36:47.053 --> 01:36:48.054]  They're not removing Trump!
[01:36:48.174 --> 01:36:52.057]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[01:36:52.057 --> 01:36:56.379]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[01:36:56.379 --> 01:37:04.885]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:37:05.245 --> 01:37:21.859]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[01:37:21.859 --> 01:37:32.908]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[01:37:33.388 --> 01:37:41.878]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[01:37:41.878 --> 01:37:48.105]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:48.105 --> 01:37:51.148]  Communist China has been fully open for business for more than six months.
[01:37:51.849 --> 01:37:56.992]  But the European Union and every other major Western nation is still under some form of lockdown.
[01:37:56.992 --> 01:38:04.937]  And the lockdowns are getting more intense and people are being told they're going to be arrested if they leave their houses, just like we've seen in Australia.
[01:38:04.937 --> 01:38:08.339]  You see, the authoritarians want total control.
[01:38:08.339 --> 01:38:13.522]  And because they don't respect this, because the general public puts up with so much abuse, they're going for broke.
[01:38:14.443 --> 01:38:15.483]  Why shouldn't they?
[01:38:15.483 --> 01:38:17.404]  They never get in trouble for the big illegal wars.
[01:38:17.404 --> 01:38:19.784]  They never get in trouble for the Chinese slave camps.
[01:38:19.784 --> 01:38:23.405]  They never get in trouble for all the terrible exploitation in Africa.
[01:38:23.405 --> 01:38:27.586]  They never get in trouble for shipping fentanyl and other deadly drugs into our country.
[01:38:27.586 --> 01:38:30.627]  And so why shouldn't they go for broke?
[01:38:30.627 --> 01:38:34.848]  Because so many people are domesticated and they're soft and they have Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:38:34.848 --> 01:38:36.048]  They love their abusers.
[01:38:36.468 --> 01:38:38.629]  They can't believe they're being lied to.
[01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:40.670]  They can't believe they're being conned.
[01:38:40.670 --> 01:38:42.692]  And so, they're going into bondage.
[01:38:42.692 --> 01:38:45.053]  You see, there's always a minority that says no.
[01:38:45.053 --> 01:38:49.155]  And InfoWars is that minority.
[01:38:49.155 --> 01:38:54.478]  DNA Force Plus, if you did one thing for your immune system, it would be get all the essential things.
[01:38:54.478 --> 01:38:56.820]  And that's the clean iodine, X2 or X3.
[01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:58.441]  That's the biotrichoselenium.
[01:38:58.441 --> 01:38:59.962]  That is the vitamin D3.
[01:38:59.962 --> 01:39:01.823]  That is the C. That is the zinc.
[01:39:01.823 --> 01:39:03.464]  There's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential.
[01:39:03.464 --> 01:39:04.064]  Without them, you die.
[01:39:04.064 --> 01:39:05.505]  And studies show you really need the other ones, too.
[01:39:05.805 --> 01:39:07.106]  But DNA Force goes beyond that.
[01:39:07.106 --> 01:39:18.671]  It helps get all that in the cells and out the cells with PQQ and CoQ10, the highest quality sources, with other ingredients that clean out the cells, that unclog them so all that stuff can get in.
[01:39:18.671 --> 01:39:19.732]  Viruses don't get in.
[01:39:19.732 --> 01:39:20.752]  The good stuff gets in.
[01:39:20.752 --> 01:39:24.794]  As the NIH website says, if you have all the proper things, they can't replicate like they could.
[01:39:25.094 --> 01:39:27.495]  I do this because it's essential, like oxygen, like water.
[01:39:27.495 --> 01:39:29.656]  DNA Force sold out for months.
[01:39:29.656 --> 01:39:30.816]  50% off out of the gates.
[01:39:30.816 --> 01:39:32.717]  Triple Patriot points, free shipping.
[01:39:32.717 --> 01:39:34.118]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:39:34.118 --> 01:39:35.618]  DNA Force Election Special.
[01:39:35.618 --> 01:39:36.559]  That's going to have to end in a week.
[01:39:36.559 --> 01:39:37.619]  We've got a limited supply.
[01:39:37.619 --> 01:39:39.420]  It was very hard to get the PQQ this time.
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:40.921]  A lot of our stuff is can't get anymore.
[01:39:40.921 --> 01:39:44.042]  A lot of our products, because the supply chain's broken down, that's part of the global's plan.
[01:39:44.042 --> 01:39:45.302]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:39:45.302 --> 01:39:46.823]  I want to thank you all for tuning in.
[01:39:49.424 --> 01:39:54.829]  For those drinking the globalist Kool-Aid, what I call the Invincibly Ignorant, there is no hope.
[01:39:54.829 --> 01:39:59.092]  But for those of you that care and are informed, we have more than hope.
[01:39:59.092 --> 01:40:03.436]  We have history on our side if we take action and if we spread the truth.
[01:40:03.436 --> 01:40:04.737]  I have been warning everyone.
[01:40:05.337 --> 01:40:08.420]  Of exactly what was going to come in the exact order.
[01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:09.380]  How did I do that?
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:14.925]  Because the globalists war game it all in public and prepare the public with brainwashing on MSN.
[01:40:14.925 --> 01:40:20.649]  When they put out the 80 million ballots, we knew it was so they could stuff it after the polls closed.
[01:40:20.649 --> 01:40:25.313]  That's why they got federal courts to rule to keep it open for weeks if need be.
[01:40:25.313 --> 01:40:26.274]  Again, it was so simple.
[01:40:26.934 --> 01:40:30.895]  And of course, you see the media heat up saying Trump did a bad job on COVID.
[01:40:30.895 --> 01:40:39.136]  And that once Biden was, quote, President-elect, he would order Trump to admit that he did a bad job and admit that he needs a second lockdown.
[01:40:39.136 --> 01:40:45.377]  And if he doesn't go under Biden's immediate control and put that lockdown in place, he'll try to remove the President with the 25th Amendment.
[01:40:45.377 --> 01:40:52.878]  And all of that is to trick Trump to take the blame for COVID that's Chinese.
[01:40:52.878 --> 01:40:55.479]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:14.864 --> 01:41:16.344]  All right, folks, I'm wound up.
[01:41:16.344 --> 01:41:17.585]  I'm crazy.
[01:41:17.585 --> 01:41:20.105]  Owen Troyer's here with us, riding shotgun.
[01:41:20.105 --> 01:41:22.346]  I'm just going to read this to you because it's the truth.
[01:41:22.346 --> 01:41:30.147]  And I'm going to ask, as an American patriot, as somebody that's going to stand in the gap for you and your family against what's coming down, that you support us.
[01:41:30.147 --> 01:41:36.068]  I'm going to read this to you right now because I'm pouring out all the money we've got to run these operations.
[01:41:36.068 --> 01:41:37.429]  America in crisis.
[01:41:37.429 --> 01:41:39.649]  Emergency lockdown 2 is coming.
[01:41:41.693 --> 01:41:46.255]  Support InfoWars in the fight against total economic collapse and Biden-Marshall law.
[01:41:46.255 --> 01:41:48.116]  This guy's is locked down too.
[01:41:48.116 --> 01:41:50.216]  Up to 60% off.
[01:41:50.216 --> 01:41:54.078]  Plus free shipping and purple Patreon points on everything.
[01:41:54.078 --> 01:42:03.322]  And we got DNA Force Plus and Alpha Power back in stock, Bodies back in stock, Biotrix-Linean back in stock, Ultratroll back in stock, Vitamin Refusion back in stock, selling out quickly.
[01:42:03.322 --> 01:42:05.643]  I'm going to say this right now.
[01:42:05.643 --> 01:42:06.463]  Remember two months ago?
[01:42:07.884 --> 01:42:12.106]  I went on air and I said, there's a good chance Biden's going to steal this with these ballots.
[01:42:12.106 --> 01:42:19.910]  Then they're going to have a COVID-2 lockdown that devastates our economy and confirms a depression and wipes out the third world.
[01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:24.553]  Then they're going to blame Trump for the COVID crisis and say he caused the depression.
[01:42:24.553 --> 01:42:29.035]  Now, Biden gave a press conference today, admitted it all, just like we said, it's the plan.
[01:42:29.035 --> 01:42:29.895]  You can figure this out.
[01:42:29.895 --> 01:42:30.576]  It's like playing chess.
[01:42:33.493 --> 01:42:36.736]  So I had like, you know, Epoch Times calling up.
[01:42:36.736 --> 01:42:38.137]  Is it true you're going bankrupt?
[01:42:38.137 --> 01:42:39.479]  No.
[01:42:39.479 --> 01:42:39.939]  Family.
[01:42:39.939 --> 01:42:42.561]  Hey, I hear you're going out of business.
[01:42:42.561 --> 01:42:43.202]  Crew members.
[01:42:43.202 --> 01:42:45.284]  I had a few people quit.
[01:42:45.284 --> 01:42:46.245]  Well, you're going out of business.
[01:42:46.245 --> 01:42:48.147]  I'm going to go work for the Blaze or whatever.
[01:42:48.147 --> 01:42:48.907]  Fine.
[01:42:48.907 --> 01:42:50.248]  I don't care as long as you're doing your job.
[01:42:50.248 --> 01:42:52.230]  I love you.
[01:42:52.230 --> 01:42:53.552]  I'm not in competition with people.
[01:42:53.552 --> 01:42:54.192]  But I explained to them.
[01:42:54.192 --> 01:42:55.653]  I said, you understand.
[01:42:55.653 --> 01:42:56.935]  America is closing.
[01:42:57.892 --> 01:42:59.812]  This is a communist, globalist takeover.
[01:42:59.812 --> 01:43:01.253]  They want to bring us to our knees.
[01:43:01.253 --> 01:43:02.913]  They're never going to end the lockdown.
[01:43:02.913 --> 01:43:03.813]  Bill Gates and the U.N.
[01:43:03.813 --> 01:43:07.594]  have said so at least 10 years of lockdown.
[01:43:07.594 --> 01:43:11.075]  Trump was standing against that because the public bought into the fear.
[01:43:11.075 --> 01:43:15.696]  He was kind of halfway going along with it to try to control it.
[01:43:15.696 --> 01:43:17.097]  Maybe he gets reelected.
[01:43:17.097 --> 01:43:18.217]  Clearly they stole it from him.
[01:43:18.217 --> 01:43:21.238]  We have a bunch of evidence we'll cover next hour with Owen Schroer.
[01:43:21.238 --> 01:43:21.938]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:43:23.052 --> 01:43:33.499]  When I get up here, and I tell you there's a good chance Biden's going to steal it, and that they're going to try to shut us down after, and try to shut down our operations, and the supply chains have already broken down.
[01:43:33.499 --> 01:43:42.545]  We called it Anthroplex, super strong, boost your body's, you know, natural test, boost all these things that's so good for your immunity.
[01:43:42.545 --> 01:43:45.026]  Nothing does that like boosting your test.
[01:43:45.026 --> 01:43:49.289]  It was a bestseller under Anthroplex, but somebody had a copyright, they threatened this.
[01:43:49.289 --> 01:43:50.510]  So I changed the name to Alpha Power.
[01:43:51.832 --> 01:43:54.574]  Super strong, super high quality.
[01:43:54.574 --> 01:44:02.158]  We haven't had this in a year because I waited and then by the time COVID hit, we couldn't get it in in the high quality version.
[01:44:02.158 --> 01:44:06.300]  It finally was available and the company told us that we're getting a supply from.
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:10.402]  We may go out of business because of the total lockdown.
[01:44:10.402 --> 01:44:14.404]  You better put in a bigger order if you ever want to get it again.
[01:44:14.404 --> 01:44:15.625]  We may close in the new year.
[01:44:15.625 --> 01:44:19.867]  We've already had a bunch of companies we worked for close the new year.
[01:44:19.867 --> 01:44:20.848]  Now, why is
[01:44:22.090 --> 01:44:25.291]  This product's special.
[01:44:25.291 --> 01:44:28.673]  What is in this?
[01:44:28.673 --> 01:44:31.734]  What does it do?
[01:44:31.734 --> 01:44:38.817]  Well, it's got a bunch of things in it, but it's got these proprietary ingredients.
[01:44:38.817 --> 01:44:39.897]  LJ-100, uricoma, long phalangea,
[01:44:44.983 --> 01:44:56.073]  Organic Maca, Horny Goatweed, Tribulus, Fruit Extract, Rice, Grain, Concentrate, Niacin, and Zinc.
[01:44:56.073 --> 01:44:59.295]  By the way, we were putting zinc in this before putting zinc in things are cool.
[01:44:59.295 --> 01:45:01.597]  Zinc just supercharges everything you do.
[01:45:01.597 --> 01:45:03.319]  It's got an organic zinc in it.
[01:45:03.319 --> 01:45:04.199]  It's back in stock.
[01:45:04.199 --> 01:45:06.101]  50% off at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:45:06.101 --> 01:45:07.222]  And it funds this whole operation.
[01:45:14.468 --> 01:45:17.190]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out for months, back in stock.
[01:45:17.190 --> 01:45:21.693]  So good for your cells, so good for your immunity, so good for your inflammation.
[01:45:21.693 --> 01:45:24.875]  It's back in stock, 30% off, InfoWareStore.com.
[01:45:24.875 --> 01:45:28.418]  DNA Force Plus is the one thing I'd be doing other than X2.
[01:45:28.418 --> 01:45:33.722]  X2, clean, pure iodine, it's essential for all human activity.
[01:45:33.722 --> 01:45:37.084]  As much as I'm stressed out, as much as I fight, as much as I do, I could not operate.
[01:45:37.084 --> 01:45:38.966]  I'd be dead without taking these products.
[01:45:38.966 --> 01:45:40.787]  When I forget to take them, I feel it.
[01:45:41.991 --> 01:45:42.831]  Now, it's expensive.
[01:45:42.831 --> 01:45:47.433]  VNA Force Plus is expensive because PQQ and CoQ10 and the high-quality forms are very expensive.
[01:45:47.433 --> 01:45:51.534]  You can't find formulas with anywhere near this dose for anywhere near this price.
[01:45:51.534 --> 01:45:56.096]  Look at that, 99% reviews, 4.9 stars, InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:46:04.879 --> 01:46:05.539]  The Cabochill.
[01:46:06.988 --> 01:46:08.369]  The Alpha Power.
[01:46:08.369 --> 01:46:09.891]  The DNA Force Plus.
[01:46:09.891 --> 01:46:14.355]  Alright, Owen Schroer, I want to keep you with me into the next hour.
[01:46:14.355 --> 01:46:19.880]  And you're only going to host part of your show today, and then you're going to have the great Harrison Smith and others take over.
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:23.383]  You're about to get on that highway, but you're going to be doing a lot of live streams there.
[01:46:23.383 --> 01:46:25.305]  We're setting it up where you're going to be dialing in to us.
[01:46:26.408 --> 01:46:27.128]  Because you're sensitive.
[01:46:27.128 --> 01:46:29.649]  We're going to have our own stream on Infowars off and on during the day.
[01:46:29.649 --> 01:46:31.410]  Showing what you're seeing, what you're witnessing.
[01:46:31.410 --> 01:46:34.251]  But imagine if people get excited.
[01:46:34.251 --> 01:46:39.273]  And imagine if all over the country, along this route and other routes, other caravans.
[01:46:39.273 --> 01:46:41.754]  We're not like, our caravan is the big caravan.
[01:46:41.754 --> 01:46:48.857]  We beg you to do your own caravan from say, West Virginia, say on Thursday, Friday, Saturday into D.C.
[01:46:48.857 --> 01:46:50.198]  or Indiana leaving Wednesday.
[01:46:50.698 --> 01:47:05.532]  Or Ohio, or New York, or Michigan, or Massachusetts, or Rhode Island, or Mississippi, or Texas, or Oklahoma, or Kansas, or Illinois, or Indiana, or Kentucky, or Tennessee, the volunteer state.
[01:47:05.532 --> 01:47:09.376]  People are calling up saying, oh, we might do a caravan, is that okay?
[01:47:09.376 --> 01:47:10.677]  You better damn well do it!
[01:47:10.677 --> 01:47:11.818]  Is it okay?
[01:47:11.818 --> 01:47:15.021]  This ain't some territorial deal where it's us getting attention!
[01:47:15.862 --> 01:47:18.303]  Only thing we did was sign this thing John Hancock, baby!
[01:47:18.303 --> 01:47:21.565]  You think we're signing on for a frickin' cakewalk here?
[01:47:21.565 --> 01:47:24.306]  This is a commie New World Order takeover.
[01:47:24.306 --> 01:47:28.308]  Everything we've built for, everything we've done now, Owen.
[01:47:28.308 --> 01:47:35.771]  This is the fight, and it's a surreal moment to be in, and you kind of just have to look around and recognize that you're in the moment now.
[01:47:35.771 --> 01:47:38.212]  It's not coming, it's not down the road, it's now.
[01:47:38.212 --> 01:47:40.774]  This is so historic that I'm like dizzy half the time now.
[01:47:40.774 --> 01:47:41.314]  You know what I mean?
[01:47:42.685 --> 01:47:57.031]  Yeah, well, I can't imagine being in this spin cycle of fake news and globalism and communism for 25 years on air like you've been without, you know, having to sacrifice some of your own sanity because it's just completely crazy.
[01:47:57.031 --> 01:47:57.311]  But look,
[01:47:58.434 --> 01:48:01.975]  I think this is the time to strike because the iron is hot.
[01:48:01.975 --> 01:48:06.917]  And I think Americans are hungry, they're awakening, they're fighting mad.
[01:48:06.917 --> 01:48:07.858]  This is the moment.
[01:48:07.858 --> 01:48:08.198]  Yeah.
[01:48:08.198 --> 01:48:11.679]  And so we have to continue that momentum and we have to... We have to lead again.
[01:48:11.679 --> 01:48:15.200]  It's not enough to say we led in the past, we must now lead at this moment.
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:21.603]  And we must now be so forceful that the spear of liberty, the spear is so
[01:48:22.703 --> 01:48:28.328]  Sharp and wide, it opens the gap for patriots to just flood through the armor.
[01:48:28.328 --> 01:48:29.449]  And so that's what's going to happen.
[01:48:29.449 --> 01:48:31.771]  If we continue to fight this, we continue to keep momentum up.
[01:48:31.771 --> 01:48:34.093]  Oh, if two million people hit D.C., it's over.
[01:48:34.093 --> 01:48:38.998]  They've censored everyone, they've shut everybody down to stop us at this moment and gaslight us.
[01:48:38.998 --> 01:48:40.179]  Everyone must go to D.C.
[01:48:40.179 --> 01:48:42.221]  this Saturday and surround the White House.
[01:48:42.221 --> 01:48:44.583]  Not the Lincoln Memorial, not the Easter Bunny.
[01:48:44.583 --> 01:48:45.444]  The White House.
[01:48:45.444 --> 01:48:46.184]  The White House.
[01:48:46.184 --> 01:48:46.905]  The White House.
[01:48:46.905 --> 01:48:47.506]  The White House.
[01:48:49.366 --> 01:48:57.572]  Don't be intimidated or bullied by the fascist left who is certainly going to try to do this as we embark on this journey to stop the steal.
[01:48:57.572 --> 01:49:03.036]  The Soros groups are going to be out there and everything, but we have to remain steadfast and our will has to be stronger.
[01:49:03.036 --> 01:49:04.057]  This is a convergence.
[01:49:04.057 --> 01:49:05.558]  Our will is stronger than theirs.
[01:49:05.558 --> 01:49:07.199]  Our will is definitely stronger than theirs.
[01:49:07.199 --> 01:49:12.343]  My problem is my will's turned up so high now I can't even handle it.
[01:49:12.343 --> 01:49:14.084]  I thought I was jacked into electricity before.
[01:49:14.084 --> 01:49:15.625]  How are you feeling?
[01:49:15.625 --> 01:49:16.866]  I can't handle it.
[01:49:16.866 --> 01:49:17.506]  It's insane now.
[01:49:19.352 --> 01:49:26.217]  You were saying earlier, it's, you know, your body, your cells are like, you know, vibrating, like telling you to do something else.
[01:49:26.217 --> 01:49:27.998]  And, you know, we don't want to do that.
[01:49:27.998 --> 01:49:29.219]  We don't want to go to that route.
[01:49:29.219 --> 01:49:31.741]  You know, we'd like to do this peacefully, politically.
[01:49:31.741 --> 01:49:34.482]  And, uh, but we will fight for America, whatever that means.
[01:49:34.482 --> 01:49:36.904]  So whatever it means to fight for America, we will do it.
[01:49:36.904 --> 01:49:38.685]  And this is what we believe the fight is right now.
[01:49:38.685 --> 01:49:40.327]  And so again, that's it.
[01:49:40.327 --> 01:49:41.828]  My cells are pissed at me.
[01:49:41.828 --> 01:49:43.068]  They're like, you're not doing enough.
[01:49:43.068 --> 01:49:44.710]  I feel like I'm being kicked in the head, man.
[01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:47.691]  So we are hoping you'll join us.
[01:49:47.691 --> 01:49:49.873]  We're hoping you'll start your own caravans.
[01:49:49.873 --> 01:49:51.334]  Find us in DC Friday.
[01:49:51.334 --> 01:49:53.235]  Find us in Atlanta Wednesday.
[01:49:53.235 --> 01:49:54.876]  Find us in Tallahassee Tuesday.
[01:49:54.876 --> 01:49:56.997]  Find us in Richmond Thursday.
[01:49:56.997 --> 01:49:59.999]  Isn't it great that Trump isn't backing down?
[01:50:01.749 --> 01:50:06.254]  You know what, it's great, but he needs to even be ramped up even more.
[01:50:06.254 --> 01:50:06.554]  I agree.
[01:50:06.554 --> 01:50:11.600]  He needs White House addresses at the Resolute Desk, laying out the election fraud every damn night.
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:16.745]  Yeah, and I think this, us... He needs to directly talk to us, but I know what he was waiting for.
[01:50:16.745 --> 01:50:18.127]  He's really a fair guy.
[01:50:18.127 --> 01:50:21.090]  He waited until the lawyers and everybody proved it was fraud.
[01:50:21.090 --> 01:50:21.791]  That's when he did this.
[01:50:22.151 --> 01:50:26.632]  And he wants to see if the American people really are ready to fight for this country and have his back, too.
[01:50:26.632 --> 01:50:27.873]  I think there's an element of that.
[01:50:27.873 --> 01:50:30.493]  Because if he sees millions in D.C.
[01:50:30.493 --> 01:50:37.915]  Well, you know, the White House told me as soon as they saw us, I don't take the credit, as soon as they saw everybody around the country mobilizing, they said, that's it.
[01:50:37.915 --> 01:50:42.276]  Trump told all of them, screw you, I'm doing it because they specifically mentioned Austin was the last straw.
[01:50:42.276 --> 01:50:43.217]  They were seeing that.
[01:50:43.217 --> 01:50:43.497]  Yeah.
[01:50:43.497 --> 01:50:46.938]  And we had thousands out in the street on Saturday.
[01:50:46.938 --> 01:50:47.618]  And I think, too,
[01:50:48.683 --> 01:50:50.444]  You know, our crowds are bigger than theirs.
[01:50:50.444 --> 01:51:02.707]  And I think that, you know, whether it's the president or whether it's somebody, you know, in his family or in his administration, they're getting it now that, look, you know, InfoWars has been ahead of all this stuff.
[01:51:02.707 --> 01:51:08.289]  So maybe we should start applying that into our formula of how we approach some of these things.
[01:51:08.289 --> 01:51:10.529]  Well, I will tell the enemy they already know this.
[01:51:10.529 --> 01:51:15.871]  If we were the formula four years ago, the White House now is listening because they know I called every facet.
[01:51:16.351 --> 01:51:16.471]  No.
[01:51:16.471 --> 01:51:24.157]  I mean, just down to the T. I mean, literally, we were sitting here, I was sitting on the war room saying, Philadelphia, they're gonna steal it, Philadelphia, they're gonna steal it, Detroit, Michigan, they're gonna steal it.
[01:51:24.157 --> 01:51:26.559]  It's like, I mean, it's not, it's just reading the cards on the table.
[01:51:26.559 --> 01:51:29.461]  Well, yeah, they were, they were tele, exactly, they were telegraphing, but at least we admitted it.
[01:51:29.461 --> 01:51:32.423]  We're gonna come back and talk about how Trump defeats him, how you defeat him.
[01:51:32.423 --> 01:51:35.265]  We can still beat him, but we've got days to do it.
[01:51:35.265 --> 01:51:36.166]  We are in the Zeitgeist.
[01:51:38.865 --> 01:51:41.167]  Talk about tomorrow's news today.
[01:51:41.167 --> 01:51:44.329]  This is all very transparent when you war game it out.
[01:51:44.329 --> 01:51:49.994]  Six months ago, InfoWars predicted that the mail-in ballots would be used to steal the election from Trump.
[01:51:49.994 --> 01:51:58.061]  They would simply pause the voting at night and then have an unlimited number that they had in reserve to bring forward in battleground states to secure the victory.
[01:51:58.061 --> 01:51:59.182]  And now that happened.
[01:51:59.182 --> 01:52:04.206]  Now, what else did I predict a few months ago and again last week and again last night, all on record?
[01:52:04.206 --> 01:52:06.307]  That when Joe Biden was president-elect,
[01:52:07.168 --> 01:52:09.029]  Via fraud, Trump would challenge it.
[01:52:09.029 --> 01:52:24.860]  But Biden's next move would be to form his own COVID task force, say that Trump is inept and has killed 267,000 Americans, which isn't true, and demand Trump's removal via the 25th Amendment if he doesn't let Joe Biden's new COVID task force give all the new orders.
[01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:29.483]  They'll tell Trump that if he backs down and follows their orders and steps down, they won't blame him for COVID.
[01:52:29.483 --> 01:52:31.184]  But if he doesn't, they're going to blame him for COVID.
[01:52:31.184 --> 01:52:34.287]  But then if he does do what they say, he's still going to blame them anyways.
[01:52:34.287 --> 01:52:36.228]  Plus, this is meant for martial law to destroy the economy.
[01:52:36.468 --> 01:52:39.930]  I warned you all.
[01:52:39.930 --> 01:52:41.410]  It's all on record.
[01:52:41.410 --> 01:52:56.577]  Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, they were all hired a year ago and then again six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic and how to get the public to take inoculations.
[01:52:56.577 --> 01:52:59.298]  And they talk about calling people heroes that do it.
[01:52:59.298 --> 01:53:01.299]  They talk about shaming those that don't.
[01:53:01.299 --> 01:53:03.400]  This has all been psychologically tested.
[01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:06.381]  It's all been psychologically prepared.
[01:53:06.381 --> 01:53:10.723]  And once they get you to lock down for 15 days, you notice now they say it's permanent.
[01:53:10.723 --> 01:53:11.403]  That's how it works.
[01:53:11.403 --> 01:53:13.765]  Oh, just put these handcuffs on.
[01:53:13.765 --> 01:53:17.086]  The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be alright.
[01:53:17.086 --> 01:53:17.867]  No.
[01:53:17.867 --> 01:53:22.789]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van.
[01:53:22.789 --> 01:53:27.271]  He's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death.
[01:53:27.271 --> 01:53:28.192]  That's the allegory.
[01:53:28.912 --> 01:53:30.374]  We gotta bust out of this thing now.
[01:53:30.374 --> 01:53:31.816]  We gotta say no now.
[01:53:31.816 --> 01:53:34.079]  We gotta make a run for it now while we still can.
[01:53:34.079 --> 01:53:37.424]  Once he gets us in that basement, it's gonna get a lot, lot worse, folks.
[01:53:37.424 --> 01:53:42.431]  So stop submitting.
[01:53:42.431 --> 01:53:45.034]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:07.594 --> 01:54:11.296]  Alright, I wasn't trying to brag in the first hour.
[01:54:11.296 --> 01:54:14.978]  It's when I get so crystal clear about what the enemy is going to do and it's so easy to beat them.
[01:54:14.978 --> 01:54:23.042]  And I get so mad when I try to lay this out that I just want to overturn the desk.
[01:54:23.042 --> 01:54:25.724]  But we're going to talk about it after Owen leaves in 15 minutes.
[01:54:25.724 --> 01:54:27.705]  He's got to go get packed.
[01:54:27.705 --> 01:54:29.186]  Some final planning.
[01:54:29.186 --> 01:54:31.247]  5 o'clock, everybody meets at the Texas Capitol.
[01:54:32.398 --> 01:54:35.659]  And whether it's 20 cars or 100 cars, you have your gas, be ready.
[01:54:35.659 --> 01:54:36.620]  We're going.
[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.280]  We're not going to worry about where you stay, what you do.
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:39.921]  This is your all on your own.
[01:54:39.921 --> 01:54:44.182]  We're with, you know, one for all, all for one, but we can't manage stuff.
[01:54:44.182 --> 01:54:49.504]  This is up to you and it'll be great to be part of the original caravan from Texas right through.
[01:54:49.504 --> 01:54:51.365]  If you're down in Houston, get ready.
[01:54:51.365 --> 01:54:54.146]  They'll announce soon where we're going to meet in Houston.
[01:54:54.146 --> 01:54:56.267]  But Owen, getting back to Trump.
[01:54:59.218 --> 01:55:03.060]  I get he wants to play golf to act like he's presidential and confident, and at least he stayed in.
[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:10.663]  I think that's great, but he's now announced these rallies, which are a great idea that should begin very, very soon.
[01:55:10.663 --> 01:55:14.545]  Yeah, and actually, if you go back and you look at the president's last, I think, 15 rallies
[01:55:16.590 --> 01:55:16.910]  We're good to go.
[01:55:39.821 --> 01:55:41.764]  Hundreds of thousands show up for the Trump rallies.
[01:55:41.764 --> 01:55:45.168]  Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina.
[01:55:45.168 --> 01:55:47.031]  Biden events, like six people maybe.
[01:55:47.031 --> 01:55:48.092]  It's all media.
[01:55:48.092 --> 01:55:52.238]  So he already has the optics of knowing that he really won those elections.
[01:55:52.238 --> 01:55:53.680]  Now he's going to come back and do it again.
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:57.385]  And I think the crowds are going to be even bigger this time, Alex.
[01:55:57.865 --> 01:55:58.646]  Oh, I agree.
[01:55:58.646 --> 01:56:00.106]  It'll be triple size.
[01:56:00.106 --> 01:56:03.308]  It's not just going to be people showing up to support Trump or be at a Trump rally.
[01:56:03.308 --> 01:56:04.589]  Now it's supporting voting.
[01:56:04.589 --> 01:56:05.070]  Everything.
[01:56:05.070 --> 01:56:06.490]  It's going to be supporting everything.
[01:56:06.490 --> 01:56:08.272]  The total repudiation of the fake news.
[01:56:08.272 --> 01:56:12.394]  And again, they just think, oh look, we're the mainstream media, we're gaslighting, you give up.
[01:56:12.394 --> 01:56:15.316]  When he doesn't give up, that scares the living hell out of them.
[01:56:15.316 --> 01:56:17.357]  And when we don't give up, it scares them even more.
[01:56:17.357 --> 01:56:21.380]  And I think that the reason why this is going to be so key, Alex, is because
[01:56:24.042 --> 01:56:27.926]  But he can throw down the gauntlet and be like, Joe, where are your crowds?
[01:56:27.926 --> 01:56:29.287]  Joe, where are your rallies?
[01:56:29.287 --> 01:56:33.572]  Joe, how come you don't have people in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, in Michigan?
[01:56:33.572 --> 01:56:36.555]  And he didn't need to whine about how he was at the polls.
[01:56:36.555 --> 01:56:39.118]  In reality, the polls were ahead of him, but he still won.
[01:56:39.118 --> 01:56:47.086]  He needs to go right to the fraud, right to Joe with nobody, how Joe's a Chicom agent, how he's illegitimate, and how America won't accept it and call America out.
[01:56:47.426 --> 01:56:50.107]  That's what they're fearing, is Trump calling us out to action.
[01:56:50.107 --> 01:57:00.211]  And I think that Americans seeing the fake acceptance by Joe Biden and the fake president-elect Joe Biden, I think that's got a lot of people like, whoa.
[01:57:00.211 --> 01:57:02.692]  It's like, whoa, it's time to fight.
[01:57:02.692 --> 01:57:04.773]  You know, hopefully not too late.
[01:57:04.773 --> 01:57:08.855]  So that's why I think the Trump rallies will be even bigger on this second go-around.
[01:57:08.855 --> 01:57:10.055]  And I think he should launch them.
[01:57:10.055 --> 01:57:11.436]  I think he should do it next week.
[01:57:12.136 --> 01:57:13.598]  He's got a launch now though.
[01:57:30.396 --> 01:57:32.997]  Giuliani and just like the board you have right here.
[01:57:32.997 --> 01:57:34.398]  Just show them the graphs.
[01:57:34.398 --> 01:57:38.559]  Oh yeah, we're going to have the graphs at the Stop the Steal Caravan.
[01:57:38.559 --> 01:57:43.641]  We're going to have the graphs with us so that when we stop and make these stops, we're going to do little presentations.
[01:57:43.641 --> 01:57:45.041]  By the way, did I pick the right route?
[01:57:45.041 --> 01:57:54.205]  Because we could obviously go up into Oklahoma, through Arkansas, through Tennessee, who are great folks, up through Kentucky, Virginia, but I just figure that southern route going to Florida is key.
[01:57:54.485 --> 01:57:58.687]  The southern route we chose because this way we can go through Georgia, where they're trying to steal it.
[01:57:58.687 --> 01:58:01.688]  We can go through North Carolina, where they're trying to steal it.
[01:58:01.688 --> 01:58:06.049]  And we can hit the capital of Florida, Tallahassee, where Trump has a huge backing.
[01:58:06.049 --> 01:58:12.332]  And if you're in West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, you want to come on, you better come on.
[01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:15.181]  Everybody always talks, oh, we'll march on Washington.
[01:58:15.181 --> 01:58:16.561]  Alex, we need to march on Washington.
[01:58:16.561 --> 01:58:17.901]  This is it, folks.
[01:58:17.901 --> 01:58:19.102]  This is the big one.
[01:58:19.102 --> 01:58:23.343]  And again, we'll keep you updated at Stop the Steal Caravan on Parler.
[01:58:23.343 --> 01:58:25.263]  At Stop the Steal Caravan on Parler.
[01:58:25.263 --> 01:58:27.184]  We're banned everywhere else, but we know we can have that on Parler.
[01:58:27.184 --> 01:58:31.625]  I'll be putting out hourly updates on where you can find us and how you can find us.
[01:58:31.625 --> 01:58:33.005]  That's parler.com.
[01:58:33.005 --> 01:58:33.885]  Stop the Steal.
[01:58:33.885 --> 01:58:35.606]  We have up to 100,000 people following it.
[01:58:36.463 --> 01:58:38.907]  And it's expanding right now.
[01:58:38.907 --> 01:58:40.729]  Hundreds of people are joining in every few minutes.
[01:58:40.729 --> 01:58:43.273]  Go to Stop the Steal on Parlor with Owen Schroyer.
[01:58:43.273 --> 01:58:43.774]  Straight ahead.
[01:58:43.774 --> 01:58:44.214]  Stay with us.
[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:51.843]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed.
[01:58:51.843 --> 01:58:53.044]  And why is that?
[01:58:53.044 --> 01:59:00.849]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree-like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds.
[01:59:00.849 --> 01:59:05.333]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[01:59:05.333 --> 01:59:06.614]  They didn't know why.
[01:59:06.614 --> 01:59:12.358]  Well, with modern science we know it's one of the purest, cleanest organic forms of selenium.
[01:59:12.958 --> 01:59:24.442]  We have BioTrue Selenium, sold out for months, back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com at 50% off, store-wide free shipping, and triple patriot points.
[01:59:24.442 --> 01:59:33.965]  BioTrue Selenium at InfoWarsStore.com is an amazing product, and it's even more amazing in that it funds our operation.
[01:59:33.965 --> 01:59:36.466]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[01:59:36.466 --> 01:59:38.807]  It is an essential nutrient in the body
[01:59:39.187 --> 01:59:40.249]  You absolutely have to have.
[01:59:40.249 --> 01:59:41.992]  It's back in stock.
[01:59:41.992 --> 01:59:42.472]  50% off.
[01:59:42.472 --> 01:59:45.838]  Triple Patriot points at InfoWareStore.com and with free shipping.
[02:00:15.851 --> 02:00:16.992]  Owen Troyer is our guest.
[02:00:16.992 --> 02:00:20.956]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we are fighting back.
[02:00:20.956 --> 02:00:22.737]  I'll be flying into Washington, D.C.
[02:00:22.737 --> 02:00:23.638]  in the next few days.
[02:00:23.638 --> 02:00:25.399]  I'm not going to say when.
[02:00:25.399 --> 02:00:30.484]  And I'm going to be running major operations against the globalists at Point Blank Range, politically and peacefully.
[02:00:30.484 --> 02:00:34.467]  And Owen Troyer is about to climb up in the armored vehicle with the RV we rented.
[02:00:35.368 --> 02:00:39.913]  And at 5.30 today, they're going to leave from the Texas Capitol on 11th Street in Congress.
[02:00:39.913 --> 02:00:48.482]  They're going to be caravaning down to Houston and then along the Gulf Coast to the capital of Florida, up into Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and D.C.
[02:00:48.482 --> 02:00:49.604]  by Friday.
[02:00:49.604 --> 02:00:54.229]  Join us in this historic Stop the Steal caravan.
[02:00:54.229 --> 02:00:55.910]  I talked to the White House and some other folks.
[02:00:57.025 --> 02:00:58.565]  Two days ago, they said, we're not giving up.
[02:00:58.565 --> 02:01:00.026]  I confirmed yesterday, they're not giving up.
[02:01:00.026 --> 02:01:02.887]  They said, watch, Trump's about to announce rallies.
[02:01:02.887 --> 02:01:04.827]  Now he's announced those rallies nationwide.
[02:01:04.827 --> 02:01:10.008]  It is up to us to stop the steal, the communist takeover, the globalist takeover.
[02:01:10.008 --> 02:01:21.492]  Joe Biden, even if Joe Biden had won this election fair and square, which he didn't, he's a communist Chinese agent with his son, who he throws in our face up on TV, hiding it in plain view.
[02:01:21.492 --> 02:01:22.872]  This is insane, Owen Schroeder.
[02:01:23.072 --> 02:01:25.593]  Well, we can't get too depressed over this.
[02:01:25.593 --> 02:01:38.577]  And we even have to prepare for the worst, and I hate to be the one that has to say this to the audience because they're not going to like this, but we still do have to prepare for the worst of them actually inaugurating Joe Biden because they have every intention to do so.
[02:01:38.577 --> 02:01:42.098]  And they've said that.
[02:01:42.098 --> 02:01:46.339]  But you've got to understand, this is why they're trying to steal the Senate seats too.
[02:01:47.423 --> 02:01:50.225]  Two in Georgia, one in Michigan.
[02:01:50.225 --> 02:01:51.506]  They need total power now.
[02:01:51.506 --> 02:01:52.747]  They're in so much trouble.
[02:01:52.747 --> 02:02:11.963]  And they know that their only hope is to have the Senate and the Presidency and then just sign all this stuff over and just sign America down the drain and then they can keep the impeachment of Joe Biden from happening for his crimes, for his involvement in Russia, in China, in Ukraine, in Romania, in Kazakhstan, in Iraq.
[02:02:13.617 --> 02:02:17.360]  He's basically a completely compromised candidate already heading in.
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:18.721]  So what are they going to do with Biden?
[02:02:18.721 --> 02:02:20.982]  Are they going to just shuffle him off?
[02:02:20.982 --> 02:02:22.363]  Like, and bring in Kamala?
[02:02:22.363 --> 02:02:24.305]  Or is he going to die magically of COVID?
[02:02:24.305 --> 02:02:25.466]  That's one of the top searches.
[02:02:25.466 --> 02:02:29.989]  There's a bunch of articles on the left saying, what happens if Biden dies before inauguration?
[02:02:30.903 --> 02:02:32.584]  I mean, he looks, he's already dead.
[02:02:32.584 --> 02:02:34.846]  But Kamala is even more phony than him.
[02:02:34.846 --> 02:02:36.547]  I mean, that's possible.
[02:02:36.547 --> 02:02:37.107]  Think about that.
[02:02:37.107 --> 02:02:38.949]  That's a double steal, Alex.
[02:02:38.949 --> 02:02:39.509]  Think about this.
[02:02:39.509 --> 02:02:41.550]  It's really like a quadruple steal.
[02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:46.053]  They stole the Democrat nomination from Bernie, but it wasn't even that.
[02:02:46.053 --> 02:02:54.999]  They stole it from Bernie, and then they never gave Tulsi Gabbard a chance, who was actually winning the debates, and then all the other clowns that were on the stage, like 17 of them or whatever.
[02:02:54.999 --> 02:02:57.861]  But Kamala was pulling the lowest.
[02:02:57.861 --> 02:02:59.002]  She was pulling the lowest.
[02:02:59.002 --> 02:02:59.582]  She was pulling at 0.1.
[02:03:00.823 --> 02:03:09.346]  So they literally said, OK, well, we'll just pull Kamala out before we have any voting so that the returns show her as, you know, zero percent on the polls.
[02:03:09.346 --> 02:03:16.047]  And then we'll just say, oh, she's the vice president of Joe Biden, who we stole it from in the primaries from Bernie Sanders.
[02:03:16.047 --> 02:03:23.190]  And then Biden will be so old and decrepit, one foot in the grave, he'll just kind of step aside or go into the sunlight or, God forbid, die.
[02:03:23.190 --> 02:03:24.350]  And then it'll be President Kamala.
[02:03:24.770 --> 02:03:33.272]  So they literally have foisted Kamala Harris from nothing, from nothing, into a certain role as the United States President.
[02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:35.212]  That's their plan.
[02:03:35.212 --> 02:03:37.853]  Because she's empty just like they are.
[02:03:37.853 --> 02:03:40.413]  She's totally, I mean, I don't even understand that woman.
[02:03:40.413 --> 02:03:42.674]  Alright, let's go ahead and look at some of these articles.
[02:03:42.674 --> 02:03:43.534]  Talk about fraud.
[02:03:43.534 --> 02:03:45.754]  Let's go ahead and cover these right now.
[02:03:45.754 --> 02:03:48.995]  But Ellen, I'm looking forward to the historic caravan you're about to lead.
[02:03:48.995 --> 02:03:49.375]  Good.
[02:03:49.375 --> 02:03:51.355]  I'm really looking forward to this.
[02:03:51.355 --> 02:03:52.376]  Are you bringing your tortoise?
[02:03:52.376 --> 02:03:53.156]  You better be, Alex.
[02:03:54.090 --> 02:03:55.330]  That's classified information.
[02:03:55.330 --> 02:03:57.691]  I was thinking about bringing my tortoise, though, yeah.
[02:03:57.691 --> 02:04:00.251]  He's named after the president, after all.
[02:04:00.251 --> 02:04:02.012]  Don J. Tortoise.
[02:04:02.012 --> 02:04:02.672]  Really?
[02:04:02.672 --> 02:04:02.972]  Yeah.
[02:04:02.972 --> 02:04:04.873]  It's a four-year-old African tortoise.
[02:04:04.873 --> 02:04:06.333]  He's African, so you can't call him racist.
[02:04:06.333 --> 02:04:07.673]  Well, you kidnapped him.
[02:04:07.673 --> 02:04:08.773]  I did not kidnap him.
[02:04:08.773 --> 02:04:10.294]  I saved him.
[02:04:10.294 --> 02:04:11.594]  I saved him from the Barbaries.
[02:04:11.594 --> 02:04:14.615]  They were ancestors of Ilhan Omar.
[02:04:14.615 --> 02:04:17.696]  Trying to sell African tortoises into slavery.
[02:04:17.696 --> 02:04:19.556]  How do you think they built the pyramids, Alex?
[02:04:19.556 --> 02:04:21.436]  Those tortoises are strong.
[02:04:21.436 --> 02:04:22.957]  You're not bringing that tortoise with you.
[02:04:25.496 --> 02:04:28.238]  No, but we are going to be bringing our American spirit.
[02:04:28.238 --> 02:04:29.658]  What got you into tortoises?
[02:04:29.658 --> 02:04:30.599]  I don't know, man.
[02:04:30.599 --> 02:04:33.500]  Have you ever seen that news clip of the little kid who, like, says he's a tortoise?
[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:34.641]  Or he says he's a turtle?
[02:04:34.641 --> 02:04:36.942]  Like, I love turtles!
[02:04:36.942 --> 02:04:37.922]  I think that may have been me.
[02:04:37.922 --> 02:04:39.503]  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[02:04:39.503 --> 02:04:40.444]  That's probably what it was.
[02:04:40.444 --> 02:04:41.985]  I like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[02:04:41.985 --> 02:04:42.645]  I think that's what it was.
[02:04:42.645 --> 02:04:43.926]  Heroes of the Half Shell.
[02:04:43.926 --> 02:04:47.007]  We're kind of going in like a tortoise vehicle, though.
[02:04:47.007 --> 02:04:48.168]  You know, the armored truck.
[02:04:48.168 --> 02:04:49.108]  It's got all the armor.
[02:04:49.108 --> 02:04:50.909]  It moves kind of slow.
[02:04:50.909 --> 02:04:53.330]  But it always gets to the destination safely.
[02:04:53.330 --> 02:04:53.591]  Oh, yeah.
[02:04:54.631 --> 02:04:55.752]  All right, let's get serious here.
[02:04:55.752 --> 02:04:58.273]  The fight for the soul of our republic has begun.
[02:04:58.273 --> 02:05:00.174]  I agree with the Gateway Pundit's headline.
[02:05:00.174 --> 02:05:04.376]  With all the recounts, investigations, audits, and count cases, the election is far from over.
[02:05:04.376 --> 02:05:05.196]  That is totally true.
[02:05:05.196 --> 02:05:08.218]  Don't let mainstream media lie to you.
[02:05:08.218 --> 02:05:09.318]  Huge breaking news in Georgia.
[02:05:09.318 --> 02:05:16.222]  132,000 ballots now confirmed in Fulton County, Georgia, have been identified, which are likely ineligible.
[02:05:16.222 --> 02:05:19.123]  And just so happen to almost all be for Joe Biden.
[02:05:20.504 --> 02:05:29.429]  And that's the only reason they haven't called Georgia for Biden yet, because they're afraid that those ballots are going to get nullified, so they're going to have to send in another 200,000.
[02:05:29.429 --> 02:05:31.730]  That's right, they just always have more.
[02:05:31.730 --> 02:05:35.973]  Republicans in Michigan goes from loser to winner after technical glitch.
[02:05:35.973 --> 02:05:39.295]  Fixed officials urge confidence in the system.
[02:05:40.233 --> 02:05:45.434]  So again, Republican in Michigan goes from loser to winner after technical glitch fixed.
[02:05:45.434 --> 02:05:48.015]  Officials urged confidence in the system.
[02:05:48.015 --> 02:06:01.397]  An incumbent Republican in Michigan went from losing his re-election race to winning it after officials discovered a technical glitch by which the results from seven precincts had been counted twice, which they kept ordering in Michigan and in Pennsylvania.
[02:06:01.397 --> 02:06:03.517]  Oh, you didn't hit upload, re-upload.
[02:06:03.517 --> 02:06:04.638]  Now the word is there too.
[02:06:04.638 --> 02:06:06.018]  It's double uploads, the same votes.
[02:06:06.118 --> 02:06:06.918]  Well, it's everywhere.
[02:06:06.918 --> 02:06:11.120]  In fact, that system, the Dominion voting system, is used in, I think, like 30 states.
[02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:17.884]  But most importantly, it's used in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, conveniently, that they stole for Biden in the dark of night.
[02:06:17.884 --> 02:06:27.148]  And you can go to theclintonfoundation.org and you can find out that it was the Clinton Foundation that brought in the Dominion voting system into our Western democracy.
[02:06:27.148 --> 02:06:27.728]  There's another one.
[02:06:27.728 --> 02:06:29.489]  Staple Street is Soros.
[02:06:29.489 --> 02:06:29.729]  Yeah.
[02:06:29.729 --> 02:06:31.170]  And it was in the key states as well.
[02:06:31.170 --> 02:06:31.610]  Yep.
[02:06:31.610 --> 02:06:32.390]  Breaking huge.
[02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:33.251]  Another glitch.
[02:06:33.891 --> 02:06:38.614]  Captured live on CNN election night, 20,000 votes swapped from Trump to Biden.
[02:06:38.614 --> 02:06:39.695]  It's magic, Alex.
[02:06:39.695 --> 02:06:50.601]  The Associated Press, though, agrees with Democrats that GOP observers should not be allowed inside Convention Center to watch vote counts, even though it's federal and state law.
[02:06:50.601 --> 02:06:53.423]  I mean, can you imagine how ridiculous that is?
[02:06:53.423 --> 02:06:57.145]  They took a victory from Donald Trump and they called it a lie.
[02:06:57.145 --> 02:06:58.206]  This country's under attack.
[02:06:58.206 --> 02:07:01.008]  Attorney Lin Wood on why he joined Trump's legal team.
[02:07:01.812 --> 02:07:03.833]  Yep, the Patriots are stepping up.
[02:07:03.833 --> 02:07:08.156]  We're going to be abandoned by some people you didn't think would abandon us, but the Patriots are stepping up, Alex.
[02:07:08.156 --> 02:07:18.984]  Facebook and Twitter suspend accounts that posted on Binford's Law showing Biden's implausible vote totals labeling as sexual exploitation.
[02:07:18.984 --> 02:07:25.529]  Yeah, I've seen videos on YouTube that show graphs and things and they call it not suitable for under 18.
[02:07:27.418 --> 02:07:29.458]  And it's just a graph.
[02:07:29.458 --> 02:07:31.559]  It's a graph and it's sexual exploitation.
[02:07:31.559 --> 02:07:36.680]  But by the way, it's the graph that shows how Biden's results are literally impossible.
[02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:37.120]  Yep.
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:40.521]  But you know, Joe Biden sniffing the kids, that's all good.
[02:07:40.521 --> 02:07:41.581]  That's right.
[02:07:41.581 --> 02:07:43.561]  I mean, it's not just good.
[02:07:43.561 --> 02:07:45.902]  Atlantic Monthly says it's a religious, Christ-like sacrament.
[02:07:45.902 --> 02:07:46.702]  It's pedo Joe.
[02:07:46.702 --> 02:07:50.703]  It actually says when he lays upon the hands, it's now a holy act.
[02:07:51.479 --> 02:07:53.340]  I guess at Jeffrey Epstein's Island, too.
[02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:54.240]  It's like a holy act.
[02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:55.321]  They'll probably have some deal.
[02:07:55.321 --> 02:07:57.742]  You'll bring your child to... Children with Bidens!
[02:07:57.742 --> 02:07:58.302]  But they're telling you!
[02:07:58.302 --> 02:08:01.563]  They actually said when they raped kids at that island, it was a holy act.
[02:08:01.563 --> 02:08:01.884]  It is!
[02:08:01.884 --> 02:08:02.984]  It's a demonic holy act.
[02:08:02.984 --> 02:08:03.644]  A holy man!
[02:08:03.644 --> 02:08:04.685]  It's a satanic religion.
[02:08:04.685 --> 02:08:06.306]  Read to your daughter right now.
[02:08:06.306 --> 02:08:13.829]  Trump campaign witnesses saw Biden-Harris bandstop at Las Vegas Nevada Center and unloaded filled boxes of ballots.
[02:08:13.829 --> 02:08:14.249]  I love that one.
[02:08:14.249 --> 02:08:16.410]  We bought that in Pennsylvania and in Michigan.
[02:08:16.530 --> 02:08:21.957]  No, how hilarious is it, Alex, that I have video where, I mean, everybody's seen it.
[02:08:21.957 --> 02:08:22.458]  Don Jr.
[02:08:22.458 --> 02:08:26.323]  retweeted it, and it's just guys just wheeling in suitcases of ballots.
[02:08:26.323 --> 02:08:27.264]  President Twitter banned it.
[02:08:27.264 --> 02:08:29.647]  The presidential election, corruption and deception.
[02:08:29.647 --> 02:08:31.910]  President elect Biden won't be for long.
[02:08:34.013 --> 02:08:35.174]  It goes on and on.
[02:08:35.174 --> 02:08:39.678]  Election changes in Wisconsin call into question tens of thousands of votes.
[02:08:39.678 --> 02:08:44.321]  Graham warns if we don't fight back, GOP may never win a presidency again.
[02:08:44.321 --> 02:08:46.443]  Yeah, this isn't parties battling for power.
[02:08:46.443 --> 02:08:51.027]  This is a party ending the voting system in America.
[02:08:51.027 --> 02:08:54.350]  Sidney Powell says they had it all planned, has the evidence.
[02:08:56.138 --> 02:09:00.602]  Trump Alliance raises a 30-day legal war as Senate hangs in the balance.
[02:09:00.602 --> 02:09:03.325]  You cannot cut the suspense with a knife.
[02:09:03.325 --> 02:09:05.567]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:09:05.567 --> 02:09:07.509]  The caravan begins in Texas.
[02:09:07.509 --> 02:09:16.237]  We're calling for caravans everywhere around the country, for truckers to run strikes, to be there Friday and Saturday, Sunday in D.C., but show up Friday, Saturday's the key day.
[02:09:16.237 --> 02:09:18.058]  And tell them about the Parler account.
[02:09:18.058 --> 02:09:21.882]  You've launched, Owen, for folks to join us anywhere on the track from Texas.
[02:09:22.302 --> 02:09:26.606]  Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Carolinas.
[02:09:26.606 --> 02:09:27.907]  Tell us how we do it!
[02:09:27.907 --> 02:09:30.469]  Follow at StopTheSteelCaravan on Parler.
[02:09:30.469 --> 02:09:33.232]  I'm going to be putting up hourly updates where you can find us.
[02:09:33.232 --> 02:09:36.775]  Our stops again, our launch tonight, Austin, Texas, 5 p.m.
[02:09:36.775 --> 02:09:39.157]  Our first stop, Houston, Texas, 8 p.m.
[02:09:39.157 --> 02:09:40.638]  tonight and onward and upward.
[02:09:40.638 --> 02:09:43.641]  God bless America, Alex Jones!
[02:09:43.641 --> 02:09:44.802]  Yes, yes, yes!
[02:09:45.450 --> 02:09:49.972]  Introducing Infowars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[02:09:49.972 --> 02:09:52.534]  This is taken under the tongue.
[02:09:52.534 --> 02:09:54.715]  It is pure turmeric.
[02:09:54.715 --> 02:10:03.920]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:09.763]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[02:10:09.763 --> 02:10:11.924]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[02:10:12.364 --> 02:10:15.605]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.

[02:10:19.565 --> 02:10:21.746]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[02:10:21.746 --> 02:10:23.106]  Some like bodies better.
[02:10:23.106 --> 02:10:27.247]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[02:10:27.247 --> 02:10:28.427]  And they fund the InfoWare.

[02:10:45.338 --> 02:10:50.804]  The controlled corporate media are mouthpieces for any big corporation or government that'll pay them.
[02:10:50.804 --> 02:10:51.465]  It's that simple.
[02:10:51.465 --> 02:10:54.208]  And they've used our open free society against us.
[02:10:54.989 --> 02:10:58.732]  The controlled media will talk about a few mistakes I've made over the years and obsess over it.
[02:10:58.732 --> 02:11:05.038]  They see he's a liar on purpose, even though our success rate, our accuracy rate, is way, way better than theirs.
[02:11:05.038 --> 02:11:06.859]  We try to tell the truth.
[02:11:06.859 --> 02:11:07.560]  They try to lie.
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:09.161]  They try to deceive.
[02:11:09.161 --> 02:11:13.565]  I'm trying to get people to realize how the globalists operate, how they manipulate, how they
[02:11:14.875 --> 02:11:15.956]  Bamboozle the public.
[02:11:15.956 --> 02:11:20.920]  I'm trying to get the public to ask the questions and to not believe what they're told in the face.
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:25.544]  I'm trying to get people to research for themselves.
[02:11:25.544 --> 02:11:32.690]  The globalists and their controlled corporate press say that researching and not trusting media is evil and is a conspiracy theory.
[02:11:32.690 --> 02:11:34.811]  Well, again, on its face, that is a fraud.
[02:11:35.792 --> 02:11:43.237]  Question everything, question InfoWars, add your own research to it, and then decide what you're going to promote to others and what news sources are accurate.
[02:11:43.237 --> 02:11:48.500]  I believe InfoWars is the best source out there.
[02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:51.122]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:06.912 --> 02:12:08.033]  Big Brother.
[02:12:08.033 --> 02:12:09.814]  Mainstream media.
[02:12:09.814 --> 02:12:11.716]  Government cover-ups.
[02:12:11.716 --> 02:12:13.417]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:12:13.417 --> 02:12:15.098]  Well, so does he.
[02:12:15.098 --> 02:12:19.782]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:12:22.071 --> 02:12:24.033]  I have a great sense of responsibility.
[02:12:24.033 --> 02:12:25.494]  I know you do.
[02:12:25.494 --> 02:12:28.997]  We can feel 246 years of our republic hanging in the balance.
[02:12:28.997 --> 02:12:31.419]  We know we're being replaced by a global government.
[02:12:31.419 --> 02:12:33.140]  Communist Chinese are the model.
[02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:35.242]  They've oppressed those people so horribly.
[02:12:35.242 --> 02:12:39.045]  It is truly godless and soulless what we're facing.
[02:12:39.045 --> 02:12:45.451]  But we have a lot of allies here in the United States and around the world, and we are coming together.
[02:12:45.451 --> 02:12:48.033]  There is an awakening that is so huge right now.
[02:12:50.094 --> 02:12:58.260]  But the establishment tends to mop that up with authoritarianism and their social credit score to shut everyone down that doesn't submit.
[02:12:58.260 --> 02:13:05.766]  They have an authoritarian answer to our movement of 1776.
[02:13:05.766 --> 02:13:06.747]  But let me just do this.
[02:13:06.747 --> 02:13:19.757]  Let me talk about Joe Biden, the liar himself, and then just briefly recap what their current plan is that we predicted that they're now executing and the only way the president can respond to it to defeat it.
[02:13:20.779 --> 02:13:26.581]  And that means we have to magnify this information like our lives depend on.
[02:13:26.581 --> 02:13:36.845]  You have seen Joe Biden come out in the last three days and say that he's the president-elect, fraudulently, and have the corporate media, mainly foreign-owned, say it.
[02:13:36.845 --> 02:13:44.768]  And you've seen Joe Biden say, hey, I want to unify the country.
[02:13:44.768 --> 02:13:50.050]  Now that's a classic military tactic like they had in World War I, where the Germans would bullhorn
[02:13:51.607 --> 02:13:57.875]  Over a speaker system, hey, your military's giving up, we're not going to hurt you, just put your hands up, you'll be okay.
[02:13:57.875 --> 02:14:06.927]  You see the classic jokes, we play a lot where Mars attacks, the Martians are shooting people with laser beams, with ray guns and saying, don't run, we're your friends.
[02:14:06.927 --> 02:14:09.430]  But when the people stop and don't run, they get shot and killed.
[02:14:11.476 --> 02:14:12.776]  When the military U.S.
[02:14:12.776 --> 02:14:19.139]  Army criminally attacked the poor Ranch Davidian cult, they were a cult, they didn't deserve to die, and killed the women and children.
[02:14:19.139 --> 02:14:22.680]  They had the armored vehicles saying, don't run, this is not an assault.
[02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:26.682]  They were shooting them on the flare footage from behind the tanks.
[02:14:26.682 --> 02:14:30.663]  So that's a tactic to tell you we're not assaulting you when we are.
[02:14:30.663 --> 02:14:35.445]  So when Joe Biden comes out and says we're not assaulting you, Michelle Obama, aka Big Mike,
[02:14:37.090 --> 02:14:37.270]  I think?
[02:15:07.845 --> 02:15:13.790]  On MSNBC, on AMJOY, saying we have to collectively burn down the Republican Party.
[02:15:13.790 --> 02:15:19.634]  And if you go on Twitter and Facebook and everywhere, this is what they're currently saying all over the place.
[02:15:19.634 --> 02:15:21.756]  Here they are.
[02:15:21.756 --> 02:15:26.319]  Entertainment organization that has a news outlet would hire these people.
[02:15:26.319 --> 02:15:31.423]  I also want to echo something that my friend EJ said.
[02:15:31.423 --> 02:15:35.406]  It's not only that Trump has to lose, but that all his enablers have to lose.
[02:15:36.527 --> 02:15:40.530]  We have to collectively, in essence, burn down the Republican Party.
[02:15:40.530 --> 02:15:41.851]  We have to level them.
[02:15:41.851 --> 02:15:47.514]  Because if there are survivors, if there are people who weathered this storm, they will do it again.
[02:15:47.514 --> 02:15:51.777]  They will take this as confirmation that, hey, it just pays to ride the waves.
[02:15:51.777 --> 02:15:53.678]  Look at me, I've made it through.
[02:15:53.678 --> 02:15:59.722]  And so up and down the ticket, federal, state, local offices, the country has to repudiate this.
[02:15:59.722 --> 02:16:03.205]  This has become a dysfunctional, anti-government party.
[02:16:03.205 --> 02:16:05.466]  That is not what the country wants and what it needs.
[02:16:07.205 --> 02:16:09.430]  So there are the Democrats pledging vengeance.
[02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:09.971]  Here's another one.
[02:16:09.971 --> 02:16:16.644]  Pete Buttigieg tells people to reach out to Trump supporters as his staff compiles a blacklist of them.
[02:16:17.745 --> 02:16:20.147]  For Big Tech to persecute.
[02:16:20.147 --> 02:16:31.456]  All because Trump ended the wars and doubled funding to black colleges and tripled funding for economic zones where you do get the money if you hire a black person.
[02:16:31.456 --> 02:16:33.878]  Which is not affirmative action.
[02:16:33.878 --> 02:16:41.645]  It's a direct government subsidy to build a factory in a major black area and then to hire a black person so they get off welfare and have a future.
[02:16:42.245 --> 02:16:50.447]  It's not, oh, I give you money and then you don't have children or you live in the shack and, you know, it's $500 a month.
[02:16:50.447 --> 02:16:56.769]  How about $5,000 a month and you actually work your ass off and you love it and you appreciate it and now you're part of the country.
[02:16:56.769 --> 02:17:02.510]  Like when Lincoln said, you're going to give every black slave 40 acres and a mule at the end of the Civil War.
[02:17:02.510 --> 02:17:08.292]  Most folks didn't get it, but it's the idea of better to teach somebody how to fish than to give them fish.
[02:17:09.628 --> 02:17:11.808]  And Trump really tried hard, didn't he?
[02:17:11.808 --> 02:17:13.329]  Doubled.
[02:17:13.329 --> 02:17:16.349]  You know, I know a lady that's on the board of a big black college.
[02:17:16.349 --> 02:17:19.310]  Traditionally black colleges are called.
[02:17:19.310 --> 02:17:23.011]  And she didn't give a damn when Trump doubled their money three years ago.
[02:17:23.011 --> 02:17:27.692]  She's out there campaigning hard against Trump.
[02:17:27.692 --> 02:17:29.412]  Because, see, it isn't about that, is it?
[02:17:29.412 --> 02:17:32.353]  It's about working for that Democratic Party that owns your ass.
[02:17:32.353 --> 02:17:35.133]  Because they know where the bodies are buried.
[02:17:35.133 --> 02:17:36.714]  And they own these black leaders.
[02:17:36.714 --> 02:17:37.734]  They own the white leaders, too.
[02:17:38.772 --> 02:17:42.595]  It's a cult, and we ain't in it, folks.
[02:17:42.595 --> 02:17:43.796]  Continuing.
[02:17:43.796 --> 02:17:51.141]  AOC, Progressives Pursue Truth and Reconciling Commission for Trump Supporters.
[02:17:51.141 --> 02:17:53.082]  And that's literally a re-education camp monger.
[02:17:53.082 --> 02:18:05.131]  They say you can't have a job, can't have a bank account, you come to our event, say you're sorry, spend months with us, admit you're wrong, and then do whatever we tell you.
[02:18:05.131 --> 02:18:06.812]  That's called a cult, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:18:09.892 --> 02:18:16.557]  You can move to Venezuela and be in one right now, or you can go under AOC and do what she has to say.
[02:18:16.557 --> 02:18:18.979]  I'm going to talk about some other important news here for a moment.
[02:18:18.979 --> 02:18:23.283]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to do what I tried to do in the first hour.
[02:18:23.283 --> 02:18:27.786]  I think I did a pretty good job, but there were thousands of data points.
[02:18:27.786 --> 02:18:37.374]  It's impossible to verbally lay it all out, but I'm going to try to give you a real analysis of what Trump's up against, what you're up against, and what's going to happen if you don't wake up and take action when we go to break and come back.
[02:18:38.877 --> 02:18:42.139]  Separately, I'm not complaining.
[02:18:42.139 --> 02:18:53.724]  In fact, the exhausted side of me just thinks, hey, I got a great crew, I got great people, but they'll understand if we implode and fall apart and just shut down, they'll go off and find other jobs, but they won't.
[02:18:53.724 --> 02:18:54.865]  This is the takeover.
[02:18:54.865 --> 02:18:56.966]  Things are going to get 10 times worse.
[02:18:56.966 --> 02:19:06.830]  We're supposed to stay on air through this nightmare, through the next lockdown, through the breakdown of society, through the total censorship, and still be on air when nobody else is.
[02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:07.771]  I've always known that.
[02:19:08.755 --> 02:19:11.817]  I've always known that's our mission, and I told you that over a decade ago.
[02:19:11.817 --> 02:19:14.718]  I saw all this coming because I've studied the enemy.
[02:19:14.718 --> 02:19:16.019]  They've got an exact program.
[02:19:16.019 --> 02:19:24.843]  So, we have a responsibility to stay on air, plus we have products you already need, but it takes money to do it, and we're not bringing in the capital we need right now to keep operating.
[02:19:24.843 --> 02:19:28.104]  So, I'm launching what I did two months ago that brought in some capital.
[02:19:28.104 --> 02:19:37.169]  I said, if Biden steals it and gets elected, he's going to do it locked down too, and we've got to have money in the bank because society's already breaking down, our supply chain's already broken down, and you saw that happen, didn't you?
[02:19:39.565 --> 02:19:43.487]  They have American Crisis Emergency Lockdown 2 is coming.
[02:19:43.487 --> 02:19:46.569]  Support InfoWars in the fight against total economic collapse.
[02:19:46.569 --> 02:19:49.431]  And Biden's martial law disguises lockdown 2.
[02:19:49.431 --> 02:19:51.352]  Up to 60% off free shipping.

[02:20:28.185 --> 02:20:29.965]  I mean, it's the end of the Republic, the end of everything.
[02:20:29.965 --> 02:20:35.987]  I mean, we're going into total depression, food shortages are already starting, and Biden's going to clamp us shut and bring us to our knees.
[02:20:35.987 --> 02:20:41.629]  He hates the Midwest, he hates the South, he hates the poor, he hates the working class, he hates you and your family.
[02:20:43.615 --> 02:20:44.415]  Warning!
[02:20:44.415 --> 02:20:45.136]  Warning!
[02:20:45.136 --> 02:20:45.996]  Warning!
[02:20:45.996 --> 02:21:01.606]  There is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover, the giant third world collapse, and a new world war that is going to be triggered by the new COVID lockdown announced by globalist systems in Europe, in Asia, and now in the United States.
[02:21:02.546 --> 02:21:17.286]  Joe Biden is set to announce today that he has a new COVID task force that is calling for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude, contact tracing, forced inoculations coming, but most importantly, a new lockdown.
[02:21:18.107 --> 02:21:25.373]  That way he can say that Trump is to blame for COVID and claim that only a new lockdown will stop COVID.
[02:21:25.373 --> 02:21:31.378]  Then of course, when that new lockdown doesn't work, those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it.
[02:21:31.378 --> 02:21:34.960]  And that's when all the mass arrests start sometime towards the end of next year.
[02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:38.123]  This is a permanent martial law plan.
[02:21:38.123 --> 02:21:42.987]  Trump must repudiate it, expose Fauci and Gates and the UN takeover, not play games with it.
[02:21:43.993 --> 02:21:48.459]  Two Info Wars best-selling products are now back in stock for being sold out for months.

[02:22:22.918 --> 02:22:23.378]  The days of hell.
[02:22:49.628 --> 02:22:52.529]  The nightmare is here.
[02:22:52.529 --> 02:22:55.770]  79 days of hell has begun!
[02:22:55.770 --> 02:23:15.658]  Multinational corporations, the mainstream media apparatus, and social media tech giants are all now being deployed by the archaic, inbred, crooked establishment to interfere with the 2020 US elections, remove the populist champion of the people, Donald J. Trump,
[02:23:16.198 --> 02:23:27.103]  And install the decrepit, perverted, traitorous establishment puppet, Joe Biden, along with rabid radical hag, Kamala Harris.

[02:23:46.494 --> 02:24:07.479]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:07.479 --> 02:24:10.440]  The enemy is taking over.
[02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:11.680]  Our very cells know it.
[02:24:14.192 --> 02:24:17.935]  This isn't just your regular conquerors taking over like the Romans.
[02:24:17.935 --> 02:24:25.461]  We're just gonna make you do their yard work and their fields, but you live in a major city and have medicine and food.
[02:24:25.461 --> 02:24:27.202]  And in some cases, you'd be better off.
[02:24:27.202 --> 02:24:36.049]  These are people that want to castrate your sons, worship Satan, and turn you into a commodity because their religion is treating humans like trash.
[02:24:36.049 --> 02:24:40.292]  Because they're these ascendant god-men.
[02:24:40.292 --> 02:24:42.794]  But really, they're just the devil's droppings.
[02:24:44.955 --> 02:24:47.576]  It's a very powerful report that Greg Reese just filed.
[02:24:47.576 --> 02:24:48.636]  It's four and a half minutes long.
[02:24:48.636 --> 02:24:54.377]  We're going to air it at the start of the next segment.
[02:24:54.377 --> 02:25:01.318]  But let me just try as best I can to say this now to the President and the American people.
[02:25:01.318 --> 02:25:09.840]  I don't know why the President and his advisors always respond to things in a two-dimensional way on their face like it's real.
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:20.943]  We don't have time for that anymore.
[02:25:20.943 --> 02:25:31.687]  They have been beating the drum that the president is behind COVID with no evidence, when it's Bill Gates, Fauci, the UN, the CHICOMS, the Wuhan lab.
[02:25:31.687 --> 02:25:35.068]  And now they're openly blaming Trump and saying he lost an election.
[02:25:35.068 --> 02:25:36.569]  He didn't lose because of it.
[02:25:38.328 --> 02:25:54.834]  And now Fauci, who's on record with Obama and others moving illegal weapons labs with gain of function coronavirus, COVID-19 viruses to China six years ago.
[02:25:54.834 --> 02:26:06.438]  And Trump must expose that because now Joe Biden is coming out with his new task force of disgruntled anti-Trumpers from the CDC, from the National Institutes of Health.
[02:26:08.547 --> 02:26:23.413]  To say that Trump's causing every death and there's a clear and present danger and he must be taken out of the White House under the 25th Amendment because he's already caused a quarter million deaths, which is fraudulent.
[02:26:23.413 --> 02:26:29.695]  And that Trump either accepts Biden's edicts early for the first time in U.S.
[02:26:29.695 --> 02:26:38.179]  history, taking over before his inauguration, or Trump will be blamed for all the deaths in the media and they will try a 25th Amendment removal.
[02:26:39.721 --> 02:26:42.164]  Trump doesn't coddle them and agree to their fraud.
[02:26:42.164 --> 02:26:44.666]  They're going to blame him anyways for it if he does that.
[02:26:44.666 --> 02:26:49.852]  He doesn't fight them and then ignore them and just let them blame him for COVID.
[02:26:49.852 --> 02:26:54.797]  President Trump frontal assaults and exposes Fauci.
[02:26:56.397 --> 02:27:25.369]  and exposes Bill Gates and exposes the Deep State and exposes Communist China and the Wuhan lab and he can put all the mainstream news up before he even got in office of how they moved it to Wuhan and how it was controversial and how scientists said Obama and Fauci and Gates were wrong and it's all before he ever even got into office and if he gets up there at those rallies or he gets up there from the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office and he systematically
[02:27:27.867 --> 02:27:37.172]  Lays out those facts instead of, oh, I blocked flights first from China, and oh, I did great on COVID.
[02:27:37.172 --> 02:27:44.756]  Instead of playing along with their game, which he's been doing, and I understand the judo move of, oh, you got a vaccine in three years, you can't reopen until then?
[02:27:46.095 --> 02:27:48.960]  I've got one now that isn't as dangerous.
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:51.344]  And then people don't have to take it, but if you want to, you can.
[02:27:51.344 --> 02:27:57.193]  He's taking power from them so people won't be scared and can feel like they can go back to work because they want a vaccine.
[02:27:57.193 --> 02:27:57.814]  It's there.
[02:27:57.814 --> 02:27:59.457]  Even though it's got side effects, it's a problem.
[02:27:59.457 --> 02:28:00.438]  I'm not endorsing a vaccine.
[02:28:01.428 --> 02:28:02.790]  Was the history of them.
[02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:05.994]  But Trump knew what he was doing, but that was the third way.
[02:28:05.994 --> 02:28:07.697]  And that didn't work, did it?
[02:28:07.697 --> 02:28:16.890]  You must frontal assault the lie of the mask not protecting people in the studies, of all the thousands of doctors censored, ready to come into press conferences, you could fill the White House lawn with people.
[02:28:18.257 --> 02:28:24.379]  You've got to get them to your rallies, you've got to expose and break the COVID fraud because it was the final coup.
[02:28:24.379 --> 02:28:35.323]  We had Russiagate, we had Ukrainegate, we had all the spy gates, we had the impeachment, and then now you have the real fifth coup that isn't just the election fraud, but it is the COVID-19 garbage.
[02:28:35.323 --> 02:28:40.384]  And the hoax is that Trump's behind it and it's the European virus and all this crap.
[02:28:40.384 --> 02:28:42.145]  And no one buys that, President Trump!
[02:28:42.825 --> 02:28:45.467]  Even liberals I've talked to go, yeah, it's way overblown.
[02:28:45.467 --> 02:28:46.767]  We know it barely kills anybody.
[02:28:46.767 --> 02:28:50.649]  We know they say people that die of gunshot wounds are on the list.
[02:28:50.649 --> 02:28:51.930]  Pfft, pneumonia, cancer.
[02:28:51.930 --> 02:28:55.312]  And of course, during the winter, they'll finally get some real deaths of something else to put on the list.
[02:28:55.312 --> 02:28:56.893]  So, of course, the numbers will finally go back up.
[02:28:56.893 --> 02:28:59.014]  The winter's here.
[02:28:59.014 --> 02:29:01.316]  Folks aren't getting their vitamins, their vitamin D. They die.
[02:29:01.316 --> 02:29:03.857]  Without it, you die.
[02:29:03.857 --> 02:29:05.878]  And Trump, really, the last few months, got this.
[02:29:05.878 --> 02:29:09.080]  He started getting hardcore, but he's got to do it now.
[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:10.701]  And he's got to do it aggressive.
[02:29:12.108 --> 02:29:14.730]  There are just some of the headlines on this front.
[02:29:14.730 --> 02:29:16.071]  COVID-1984.
[02:29:16.071 --> 02:29:20.975]  Parents blocked from seeing sick newborns by UK's socialized health care system.
[02:29:20.975 --> 02:29:23.957]  This is just government health care power grabbing.
[02:29:23.957 --> 02:29:25.979]  Not letting folks see old folks.
[02:29:25.979 --> 02:29:26.960]  Letting them kill people.
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:29.722]  Letting them put intubation down their throats.
[02:29:29.722 --> 02:29:31.143]  This is a power grab.
[02:29:31.143 --> 02:29:33.165]  This is the hospitals turning into prisons.
[02:29:33.165 --> 02:29:35.827]  All over the world and are you in direction, we should reject it.
[02:29:38.314 --> 02:29:46.300]  Hundreds of UK medics and academics urge Boris Johnson COVID data is exaggerated and second wave talk is misleading.
[02:29:46.300 --> 02:29:52.785]  German doctors urge Chancellor Merkel to put an end to the COVID fear machine.
[02:29:52.785 --> 02:29:58.829]  They're going to say that it's 90 plus percent exaggerated, absolutely out of control, not even as bad as the flu.
[02:29:58.829 --> 02:30:02.392]  And they're prestigious.
[02:30:02.392 --> 02:30:03.553]  This is the key.
[02:30:03.553 --> 02:30:04.614]  It's at InfoWars.com.
[02:30:06.127 --> 02:30:11.571]  New York Bar Association calls for mandatory COVID vaccine with no exceptions.
[02:30:11.571 --> 02:30:15.174]  So the lawyers for Big Pharma want to make you take this.
[02:30:15.174 --> 02:30:16.535]  They're not doctors.
[02:30:16.535 --> 02:30:17.796]  They're not patients.
[02:30:17.796 --> 02:30:21.719]  They have no standing, but they want to violate your most fundamental rights.
[02:30:21.719 --> 02:30:25.722]  That's how the lawyers in America have gone from corrupt to damn right evil.
[02:30:28.174 --> 02:30:35.061]  Meanwhile, the main push to get rid of Trump, to make Biden look presidential, to act like Trump's done nothing.
[02:30:35.061 --> 02:30:37.223]  He says, you're causing hundreds of deaths a day.
[02:30:37.223 --> 02:30:39.326]  You're causing thousands of cases a day.
[02:30:39.326 --> 02:30:41.007]  Do what I say or you're bad.
[02:30:41.007 --> 02:30:43.830]  Accept my takeover earlier or you're bad.
[02:30:43.830 --> 02:30:46.032]  If Trump agrees with the takeover, he's sold out.
[02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:49.522]  If he copies the takeover, he sells out.
[02:30:49.522 --> 02:30:55.686]  The only way to do it is to destroy them politically with the truth and blow this lie up altogether.
[02:30:55.686 --> 02:30:59.409]  Trump in denial over election defeat as Biden gears up to fight COVID.
[02:30:59.409 --> 02:31:01.791]  He's so presidential.
[02:31:01.791 --> 02:31:03.712]  Dow rallies 1,100 points.
[02:31:03.712 --> 02:31:04.272]  It's up more.
[02:31:04.272 --> 02:31:05.073]  That was this morning.
[02:31:05.073 --> 02:31:06.734]  It's pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[02:31:06.734 --> 02:31:11.878]  Hits record as Pfizer says COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective.
[02:31:11.878 --> 02:31:12.939]  And cue up that clip, though.
[02:31:13.831 --> 02:31:15.252]  I think it's on the list here.
[02:31:15.252 --> 02:31:18.815]  Governor Cuomo came out and said, I don't care what he says, it's not safe.
[02:31:18.815 --> 02:31:21.477]  Because they want the lockdown to continue.
[02:31:21.477 --> 02:31:23.279]  I'm not endorsing the vaccine.
[02:31:23.279 --> 02:31:32.006]  Trump got Pfizer and others to actually put out a real attenuated version of the virus, not an mRNA vaccine that changes your DNA.
[02:31:32.006 --> 02:31:32.726]  That's even worse.
[02:31:33.700 --> 02:31:35.521]  To again, take control of the fear.
[02:31:35.521 --> 02:31:36.943]  Get people not to be in fear.
[02:31:36.943 --> 02:31:38.083]  To have a solution.
[02:31:38.083 --> 02:31:39.324]  Even though it's a fraudulent solution.
[02:31:39.324 --> 02:31:40.585]  I get the Machiavellian action.
[02:31:40.585 --> 02:31:41.986]  Doesn't mean I agree with it.
[02:31:41.986 --> 02:31:43.748]  The media keeps misrepresenting I agree with it.
[02:31:43.748 --> 02:31:45.469]  I don't.
[02:31:45.469 --> 02:31:46.410]  That goes way up.
[02:31:46.410 --> 02:31:48.832]  The stocks go way up.
[02:31:48.832 --> 02:31:49.672]  So the fear can end.
[02:31:49.672 --> 02:31:50.413]  The lockdown can end.
[02:31:50.413 --> 02:31:54.336]  Just as Trump said he'd have the vaccine ready right after election.
[02:31:54.336 --> 02:31:56.457]  They don't care.
[02:31:56.457 --> 02:31:59.100]  They say it's going to continue on forever.
[02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:00.561]  And Cuomo, I have the video.
[02:32:00.561 --> 02:32:01.722]  I saw it this morning.
[02:32:01.722 --> 02:32:02.942]  If you guys don't have it, try to queue it up.
[02:32:03.834 --> 02:32:09.459]  Cuomo says on MSNBC, we're not going to accept it, don't take it.
[02:32:09.459 --> 02:32:13.802]  I even have the article here, just type in Cuomo says don't take Pfizer vaccine.
[02:32:13.802 --> 02:32:17.105]  Pfizer says COVID-19 vaccine is looking 90% effective.
[02:32:17.105 --> 02:32:18.826]  AP and major studies.
[02:32:18.826 --> 02:32:24.431]  Here it is, Governor Cuomo threatens to block Trump admin's distribution of COVID vaccine.
[02:32:24.431 --> 02:32:31.617]  Because he's the doctor, he's the lawyer, he's the patient, he's the boss that shipped infected people into nursing homes to get half the deaths in New York.
[02:32:33.095 --> 02:32:36.576]  Official data has exaggerated the risk of COVID.
[02:32:36.576 --> 02:32:39.417]  500 academics tell Forrest Johnson.
[02:32:39.417 --> 02:32:42.098]  And it just goes on with more people.
[02:32:42.098 --> 02:32:42.958]  Super spreaders!
[02:32:42.958 --> 02:32:48.920]  Biden campaign urges people to wear masks, social distance amid packed celebrations to go along with the hoax.
[02:32:48.920 --> 02:32:56.122]  New Jersey tightens COVID-19 restrictions as New York Mayor warns city on cusp of second wave.
[02:32:56.122 --> 02:32:57.943]  It's just an endless leftist lockdown, folks.
[02:32:59.755 --> 02:33:04.560]  Meanwhile, the media is censoring Trump actually talking about all of this.
[02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:07.344]  Biden's unveiled his COVID advisory board.
[02:33:07.344 --> 02:33:10.067]  It includes a controversial figure Trump fired for incompetence.
[02:33:12.554 --> 02:33:19.777]  Ben Sasse rips Cuomo for shameless politicizing of Wuhan coronavirus vaccine, saying the public can't have it.
[02:33:19.777 --> 02:33:24.880]  Biden puts official removed from Trump administration for alleged incompetence on the task force.
[02:33:24.880 --> 02:33:26.660]  It's all political.
[02:33:26.660 --> 02:33:28.221]  They couldn't get away with regular martial law.
[02:33:28.221 --> 02:33:28.741]  You'd never do it.
[02:33:28.741 --> 02:33:30.542]  But if it's for a virus, they will.
[02:33:30.542 --> 02:33:33.323]  But they don't want it to end, so they go, oh, there is no vaccine.
[02:33:33.323 --> 02:33:35.705]  Or they say, if there is a vaccine, it won't have antibodies.
[02:33:35.705 --> 02:33:37.445]  Because they want to keep you locked down.
[02:33:37.445 --> 02:33:40.687]  That's the real weapon that will kill hundreds of millions of third world citizens.
[02:33:42.813 --> 02:33:43.954]  Look it up for yourself.
[02:33:43.954 --> 02:33:57.744]  The head of the Davos Group issued a report more than six months ago calling for world government to be openly established to respond to COVID-19, and that COVID-19 was a blessing to lower the planet's carbon footprint.
[02:33:57.744 --> 02:34:02.628]  Since then, Prince Charles and countless others have come out and said the exact same thing.
[02:34:03.528 --> 02:34:08.471]  The most ancient form of total war is called siege.
[02:34:08.471 --> 02:34:11.192]  And that's when you cut people off from their resources.
[02:34:11.192 --> 02:34:12.993]  That's when you lock them down.
[02:34:13.945 --> 02:34:17.466]  And this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalists or just get rid of Donald Trump.
[02:34:17.466 --> 02:34:18.266]  That's only part of it.
[02:34:18.266 --> 02:34:30.629]  This is siege to literally train us to be poor and to get us into deep debt so then the globalist social engineers can dictate how we live our lives with the social credit score surveillance grid.
[02:34:30.629 --> 02:34:31.969]  So you've heard the U.S.
[02:34:31.969 --> 02:34:34.690]  Army saying our job is to kill people and break things?
[02:34:34.690 --> 02:34:36.451]  Well, that's what the lockdown's doing.
[02:34:36.451 --> 02:34:39.011]  It's starving the third world, millions and millions of death.
[02:34:39.011 --> 02:34:41.192]  It's breaking down the supply chain in society.
[02:34:41.192 --> 02:34:41.752]  It's their mission.
[02:34:42.432 --> 02:34:53.238]  The problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites, the most cunning, smart, inventive people, believe that chivalry doesn't exist anymore.
[02:34:53.238 --> 02:34:58.100]  They don't believe in being aristocrats, trying to hold up civilization and empower the people.
[02:34:58.100 --> 02:35:02.723]  And once the establishment has that predatory idea, civilization collapses very, very quickly.
[02:35:02.723 --> 02:35:07.965]  You can't treat the least of us like garbage and not treat your own family like that.
[02:35:07.965 --> 02:35:10.407]  And so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us.
[02:35:11.745 --> 02:35:21.393]  The globalists can try to be heartless devil worshippers that commit rituals of all sorts of horrible crimes, try to get away from the humanity, but really, they can't escape the laws of the universe.
[02:35:21.393 --> 02:35:26.156]  They may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves, but...
[02:35:26.997 --> 02:35:32.522]  The repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and the very structure itself.
[02:35:32.522 --> 02:35:34.664]  Wealth is created by loving God.
[02:35:34.664 --> 02:35:36.866]  Wealth is created by having a connection to God.
[02:35:36.866 --> 02:35:39.649]  God is the source of all creation, all success, all power.
[02:35:39.649 --> 02:35:41.591]  If you deny that, you'll be destroyed.
[02:35:43.237 --> 02:35:44.257]  DNA Force Plus.
[02:35:44.257 --> 02:35:48.539]  If you did one thing for your immune system, it would be get all the essential things.
[02:35:48.539 --> 02:35:50.880]  And that's the clean iodine, X2 or X3.
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:52.501]  That's the bio-tris-selenium.
[02:35:52.501 --> 02:35:54.022]  That is the vitamin D3.
[02:35:54.022 --> 02:35:55.882]  That is the C. That is the zinc.
[02:35:55.882 --> 02:35:57.523]  There's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential.
[02:35:57.523 --> 02:35:58.123]  Without them, you die.
[02:35:58.123 --> 02:35:59.564]  And studies show you really need the other ones, too.
[02:35:59.884 --> 02:36:01.186]  But DNA Force goes beyond that.
[02:36:01.186 --> 02:36:12.759]  It helps get all that in the cells and out the cells with PQQ and CoQ10 of the highest quality sources with other ingredients that clean out the cells, that unclog them so all that stuff can get in.
[02:36:12.759 --> 02:36:13.821]  Viruses don't get in.
[02:36:13.821 --> 02:36:14.842]  The good stuff gets in.
[02:36:14.842 --> 02:36:18.887]  As the NIH website says, if you have all the proper things, they can't replicate like they could.
[02:36:19.167 --> 02:36:21.569]  I do this because it's essential, like oxygen, like water.
[02:36:21.569 --> 02:36:24.893]  DNA Force sold out for months, 50% off out of the gates.
[02:36:24.893 --> 02:36:28.196]  Triple Patriot Points, free shipping, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:36:28.196 --> 02:36:30.638]  DNA Force Election Special, that's going to have to end in a week.
[02:36:30.638 --> 02:36:33.501]  We've got a limited supply, it was very hard to get the PQQ this time.
[02:36:33.501 --> 02:36:38.126]  A lot of our stuff can't get anymore, a lot of our products, because the supply chain's broken down, that's part of the global's plan.
[02:36:38.126 --> 02:36:39.087]  InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:36:39.087 --> 02:36:40.889]  I want to thank you all for tuning in.
[02:36:43.431 --> 02:36:48.833]  For those drinking the globalist Kool-Aid, what I call the Invincibly Ignorant, there is no hope.
[02:36:48.833 --> 02:36:53.095]  But for those of you that care and are informed, we have more than hope.
[02:36:53.095 --> 02:36:57.417]  We have history on our side if we take action and if we spread the truth.
[02:36:57.417 --> 02:36:58.738]  I have been warning everyone.
[02:36:59.338 --> 02:37:02.422]  Of exactly what was going to come in the exact order.
[02:37:02.422 --> 02:37:03.383]  How did I do that?
[02:37:03.383 --> 02:37:08.929]  Because the globalists war game it all in public and prepare the public with brainwashing on MSN.
[02:37:08.929 --> 02:37:14.655]  When they put out the 80 million ballots, we knew it was so they could stuff it after the polls closed.
[02:37:14.655 --> 02:37:19.180]  That's why they got federal courts to rule to keep it open for weeks if need be.
[02:37:19.180 --> 02:37:20.301]  Again, it was so simple.
[02:37:20.942 --> 02:37:24.904]  And of course, you see the media heat up saying Trump did a bad job on COVID.
[02:37:24.904 --> 02:37:33.148]  And that once Biden was, quote, President-elect, he would order Trump to admit that he did a bad job and admit that he needs a second lockdown.
[02:37:33.148 --> 02:37:39.392]  And if he doesn't go under Biden's immediate control and put that lockdown in place, he'll try to remove the President with the 25th Amendment.
[02:37:39.392 --> 02:37:46.495]  And all of that is to trick Trump to take the blame for COVID that's Chinese.
[02:37:46.495 --> 02:37:49.097]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:38:00.092 --> 02:38:11.080]  By the way, I'm going to come back tonight, 7 to 9 central in studio with DeAnne Lorraine and others to cover the launch of the caravan from Texas to Virginia and to D.C.
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:14.002]  to save our president.
[02:38:14.002 --> 02:38:17.764]  The air starts to rumble.
[02:38:17.764 --> 02:38:26.290]  And if all of you get excited and fight back against these bullies, it's going to cause a chain reaction.
[02:38:38.317 --> 02:38:39.318]  They called Hillary a god.
[02:38:39.318 --> 02:38:53.466]  Now Atlantic Monthly says when Joe Biden touches your child, it's a Christ-like sacrament.
[02:38:53.466 --> 02:38:57.489]  My very DNA, my cells are crying out against what's happening.
[02:38:57.489 --> 02:39:03.593]  But let's not tear each other up in this fight like sharks will get in a frenzy and bite each other.
[02:39:03.593 --> 02:39:07.095]  Let's stay focused, let's be humans that are above our animal selves.
[02:39:08.883 --> 02:39:12.646]  Acting like a robot.
[02:39:12.646 --> 02:39:14.888]  Let's not be a robot either.
[02:39:14.888 --> 02:39:16.890]  And let's come together and change history.
[02:39:18.855 --> 02:39:24.736]  Alright, let's go ahead and the guys found it like a minute without me even asking.
[02:39:24.736 --> 02:39:32.498]  The clip of Cuomo saying, oh don't take Trump's vaccine because they want the fear to keep going when you get their mRNA vaccine.
[02:39:32.498 --> 02:39:38.140]  That's like being shot by a BB gun versus being shot by a 12-gauge shotgun with a double-locked buck.
[02:39:38.140 --> 02:39:40.180]  I'm not saying take the vaccine.
[02:39:40.180 --> 02:39:46.622]  I'm not saying take the regular Pfizer attenuated where they microwave or radiate a coronavirus.
[02:39:47.611 --> 02:39:47.931]  I think so.
[02:40:10.373 --> 02:40:15.535]  He showed you back in March and April this year, all the government documents where they already had the vaccines ready.
[02:40:15.535 --> 02:40:16.675]  They have the ingredients ready.
[02:40:16.675 --> 02:40:22.737]  They just gotta get this vaccine itself certified with how much adjuvant they're gonna add, how much aluminum.
[02:40:22.737 --> 02:40:24.857]  So Trump said, old people might need it.
[02:40:24.857 --> 02:40:25.838]  That's who gets killed by this.
[02:40:25.838 --> 02:40:26.898]  Probably not young people.
[02:40:26.898 --> 02:40:29.198]  It's up to you if you want to take it.
[02:40:29.198 --> 02:40:30.699]  That's how he hijacked what they were doing.
[02:40:30.699 --> 02:40:34.080]  I saw what he was doing.
[02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:34.200]  And
[02:40:36.067 --> 02:40:37.609]  That they got really upset about it.
[02:40:37.609 --> 02:40:39.351]  And Bill Gates got upset.
[02:40:39.351 --> 02:40:45.480]  And then he said, oh no, it's going to be years until the mRNA comes out, which again, is not a vaccine.
[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:51.488]  As Robert Barnes' conscious lawyers explain, it's drugs they call a vaccine.
[02:40:51.488 --> 02:40:53.631]  And sure, vaccines are classified as a drug, but what is a drug?
[02:40:55.691 --> 02:40:57.352]  It could be a million different things.
[02:40:57.352 --> 02:41:05.618]  It's live viruses genetically engineered that are synthetic to go in and reprogram your cells.
[02:41:05.618 --> 02:41:07.880]  That's a whole new universe.
[02:41:09.329 --> 02:41:11.990]  And that's the revolution against us, and that's what's so dangerous.
[02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:32.138]  And that's why I'm so sick about Joe Biden taking over, because he says an endless lockdown, you're going to accept contact tracers, you're going to accept phone apps, you're going to have to have these shots to have jobs, and he's saying it all, and his party, and the globalists, and Fauci, and Bill Gates, and Obama, we're behind the damn Wuhan virus on record!
[02:41:35.916 --> 02:41:38.140]  But it's the perfect takeover for martial law.
[02:41:38.140 --> 02:41:43.009]  So here's Cuomo, the same guy that sent COVID patients into nursing homes to kill people.
[02:41:43.009 --> 02:41:45.093]  Here he is saying, don't take Trump's vaccine.
[02:41:45.093 --> 02:41:45.373]  Here it is.
[02:41:46.820 --> 02:41:49.341]  I'm sure the Biden administration is going to address that.
[02:41:49.341 --> 02:41:52.921]  I think his first step saying, let's focus on the science.
[02:41:52.921 --> 02:41:57.242]  Let's depoliticize testing data.
[02:41:57.242 --> 02:41:59.702]  Listen to the science is the exact opposite of Trump.
[02:41:59.702 --> 02:42:08.844]  But you have two months and we can't let this vaccination plan go forward the way the Trump administration is designing it.
[02:42:08.844 --> 02:42:12.265]  Because Biden can't undo it two months later.
[02:42:12.265 --> 02:42:13.465]  We'll be in the midst of it.
[02:42:14.465 --> 02:42:18.846]  And I'm going, I've been talking to governors across the nation about that.
[02:42:18.846 --> 02:42:27.548]  How can we shape the Trump administration vaccine plan to fix it or stop it before it does damage?
[02:42:27.548 --> 02:42:31.109]  Have you known that he talks like he's in that McDonald's ad?
[02:42:31.109 --> 02:42:37.731]  Nothing against down syndrome children, but welcome to McDonald's, may I help you?
[02:42:37.731 --> 02:42:41.412]  And he's sitting there telling you
[02:42:42.810 --> 02:42:46.052]  Then we may not let him do that!
[02:42:46.052 --> 02:42:55.077]  Because they've got their mRNA vaccine ready for you and your family, that's super deadly, that everybody gets sick, and many have died in the trials, because they want the fear to go on.
[02:42:55.077 --> 02:42:57.038]  Bill Gates says there'll never be a vaccine now.
[02:42:57.038 --> 02:42:58.639]  The lockdown never stops.
[02:42:58.639 --> 02:43:01.681]  I wanted to kill you with vaccines, but said I'll just kill you because there's not a vaccine.
[02:43:01.681 --> 02:43:04.083]  You can never leave your house again, because one person might die.
[02:43:04.083 --> 02:43:08.845]  It doesn't matter if the British Pentagon admits that it's going to cause world war and millions are starving to death every month.
[02:43:08.845 --> 02:43:11.167]  It doesn't matter because I'm Bill Gates and I'm your God.
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:14.721]  I'm your king, I'm your master, I'm your lord!
[02:43:33.516 --> 02:43:37.878]  Hindsight is 2020, and the enemy is very cunning.
[02:43:37.878 --> 02:43:44.621]  But now that they have launched their coup against President Donald J. Trump, we can see their battle plans.
[02:43:44.621 --> 02:43:49.483]  He got four years in the White House, and they weren't going to give him a second term.
[02:43:49.483 --> 02:43:53.125]  Plans for 2020 began immediately following the 2016 election.
[02:43:55.726 --> 02:44:05.536]  Nine days before Trump's inauguration, Fauci says there is no doubt that President Trump will be confronted with a surprise infectious disease.
[02:44:05.536 --> 02:44:11.742]  Two days after the president's inauguration, Bill Gates spoke at Davos and warned of a coming deadly pandemic.
[02:44:12.723 --> 02:44:32.880]  An illegal surveillance operation was already launched before the election, and the president was then subjected to four years of non-stop baseless attacks and defamation, keeping Trump on the constant defense and the American people distracted while the deep state establishment prepared for the 2020 election.
[02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:38.986]  The COVID hoax was in the works years before the election of Donald Trump, but they started fast-tracking it.
[02:44:40.413 --> 02:44:48.779]  In 2017, Dr. Fauci began the controversial program of manipulating a virus to become more infectious to humans.
[02:44:48.779 --> 02:44:52.942]  This is known as gain-of-function research.
[02:44:52.942 --> 02:45:00.387]  In 2018, several CIA agents are elected into public office, claiming their new mission is to foil Trump.
[02:45:01.928 --> 02:45:11.836]  In 2019, Fauci committed $3.7 million to the Wuhan lab in China for gain-of-function work on bat coronaviruses.
[02:45:11.836 --> 02:45:19.783]  In 2019, Dominion voting machines, funded by the Clinton Foundation, expanded their 1,600 jurisdictions into the state of Georgia.
[02:45:20.564 --> 02:45:36.057]  In October of 2019, the Gates Foundation, the World Economic Forum, and Johns Hopkins sponsored Event 201, a tabletop exercise that simulated millions dying from a strain of coronavirus.
[02:45:36.057 --> 02:45:40.280]  Two months later, China reports an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan.
[02:45:41.261 --> 02:45:43.765]  March 13th, 2020, the U.S.
[02:45:43.765 --> 02:45:45.628]  shuts down for COVID.
[02:45:45.628 --> 02:45:49.134]  Thousands of people lose their jobs overnight.
[02:45:49.134 --> 02:45:51.918]  We are told that masks don't work.
[02:45:51.918 --> 02:45:54.442]  And yet, we are told that we must wear them.
[02:45:55.620 --> 02:46:08.567]  On March 16th, the Brennan Center for Justice releases how to protect the 2020 vote from the coronavirus and suggest mail-in ballots, among other changes to the election.
[02:46:08.567 --> 02:46:11.308]  The media tries to blame Trump.
[02:46:11.308 --> 02:46:17.872]  Fear is injected into the brainwashed masses over an alleged virus less deadly than the common cold.
[02:46:18.912 --> 02:46:24.476]  On May 25th, Soros-funded violent protests erupt throughout the country.
[02:46:24.476 --> 02:46:31.741]  For the rest of the summer, cities burn, businesses are looted, and people are murdered in the streets.
[02:46:31.741 --> 02:46:39.366]  The entire platform of the Democrat Party becomes, if you want the chaos to end, vote for Joe Biden.
[02:46:39.366 --> 02:46:48.132]  In September of 2020, the Mockingbird media began reporting that Trump will refuse to leave the White House when he is beaten in November.
[02:46:49.692 --> 02:46:57.476]  On election night, just as the president begins to surge in critical states, the election is inexplicably halted.
[02:46:57.476 --> 02:47:02.118]  Thousands of mail-in ballots appear in the middle of the night, all for Joe Biden.
[02:47:04.195 --> 02:47:12.500]  While completely ignoring massive evidence of voter fraud, the mainstream media prematurely calls victory for Joe Biden.
[02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:22.865]  And now, agents of the deep state are decloaking themselves, calling for the president to concede and give full power back to the crooked establishment.
[02:47:22.865 --> 02:47:29.589]  If the president concedes, the Trump family will be forever destroyed, and America will fall into chaos.
[02:47:30.976 --> 02:47:41.981]  The only route to victory is to win the election in the courts and go on a massive offensive against the Deep State establishment and the Mockingbird media.
[02:47:41.981 --> 02:47:46.864]  Those attempting to overthrow the United States need to be executed.
[02:47:46.864 --> 02:47:48.905]  The battle is just beginning.
[02:47:48.905 --> 02:47:51.306]  God bless America.
[02:47:51.306 --> 02:47:53.527]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[02:47:57.657 --> 02:48:02.069]  The four-year planned overthrow of the elected president just went live at Bandot Video.
[02:48:02.069 --> 02:48:04.355]  I suggest you use that weapon system while it's still available.
[02:48:04.355 --> 02:48:06.220]  They're working around the clock to shut it down now.
[02:48:07.216 --> 02:48:11.681]  We are loyal to common sense and to God, and that means our republic.
[02:48:11.681 --> 02:48:14.864]  We are steadfast, but we're made of flesh and blood.
[02:48:14.864 --> 02:48:15.885]  So we'll never give up.
[02:48:15.885 --> 02:48:18.408]  We could give out, or we could go crazy.

[02:49:33.211 --> 02:49:36.952]  Communist China has been fully open for business for more than six months.
[02:49:36.952 --> 02:49:42.094]  But the European Union and every other major Western nation is still under some form of lockdown.
[02:49:42.094 --> 02:49:49.297]  And the lockdowns are getting more intense and people are being told they're going to be arrested if they leave their houses, just like we've seen in Australia.
[02:49:50.037 --> 02:49:53.439]  You see, the authoritarians want total control.
[02:49:53.439 --> 02:49:59.542]  And because they don't respect this, because the general public puts up with so much abuse, they're going for broke.
[02:49:59.542 --> 02:50:00.582]  Why shouldn't they?
[02:50:00.582 --> 02:50:02.503]  They never get in trouble for the big illegal wars.
[02:50:02.503 --> 02:50:04.884]  They never get in trouble for the Chinese slave camps.
[02:50:04.884 --> 02:50:08.506]  They never get in trouble for all the terrible exploitation in Africa.
[02:50:08.506 --> 02:50:11.928]  They never get in trouble for shipping fentanyl and other deadly drugs into our country.
[02:50:12.668 --> 02:50:15.709]  And so why shouldn't they go for broke?
[02:50:15.709 --> 02:50:19.950]  Because so many people are domesticated and they're soft and they have Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:50:19.950 --> 02:50:21.551]  They love their abusers.
[02:50:21.551 --> 02:50:23.711]  They can't believe they're being lied to.
[02:50:23.711 --> 02:50:25.772]  They can't believe they're being conned.
[02:50:25.772 --> 02:50:27.792]  And so they're going into bondage.
[02:50:27.792 --> 02:50:30.153]  You see, there's always a minority that says no.
[02:50:30.153 --> 02:50:36.935]  And InfoWars is that minority.
[02:50:36.935 --> 02:50:39.556]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:45.439 --> 02:50:46.260]  This isn't hype.
[02:50:46.260 --> 02:50:47.880]  This is the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:50.242]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:50:50.242 --> 02:50:59.747]  If every American could see one of these videos today, it'd change the whole course of the nation.
[02:50:59.747 --> 02:51:00.608]  But they've censored us.
[02:51:00.608 --> 02:51:01.248]  They've blocked us.
[02:51:01.248 --> 02:51:03.769]  The only place to find it is BandOnVideo.
[02:51:03.769 --> 02:51:12.875]  But if you simply go and get these links, and share these links, or download them, or however you do it, and tell others, hey, here's the secret truth you're not supposed to see,
[02:51:13.755 --> 02:51:19.638]  If you simply share these two videos that are at InfoWars.com, it will defeat the globalists.
[02:51:19.638 --> 02:51:22.300]  It's truth that will set us free, as Jesus Christ said.
[02:51:22.300 --> 02:51:26.882]  The four-year plan to overthrow an elected president is four and a half minutes long.
[02:51:26.882 --> 02:51:28.023]  It's at InfoWars.com.
[02:51:28.023 --> 02:51:28.623]  It's Greg Reese.
[02:51:28.623 --> 02:51:30.924]  It's a Bandai video.
[02:51:30.924 --> 02:51:33.986]  And Paul Joseph Watson, the truth about the presidential election.
[02:51:33.986 --> 02:51:38.749]  We're going to air it next segment, and then Gerald Cilente takes over.
[02:51:38.749 --> 02:51:40.690]  It's very powerful as well.
[02:51:40.690 --> 02:51:42.170]  Then, as I said, I'll be back tonight, 7 to 9.
[02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:48.562]  Co-hosting with Deanna Lorraine here in studio to cover the latest developments.
[02:51:48.562 --> 02:51:56.264]  Again, I don't say this to sound official or to sound powerful.
[02:51:56.264 --> 02:52:03.927]  I say it because you need to understand something.
[02:52:03.927 --> 02:52:12.550]  Let's say you're on a space station and there's a malfunction in the computer and there's a small fire and you extinguish it out.
[02:52:14.025 --> 02:52:27.248]  And then you go and you see that a particular piece is fried that deals with the oxygen scrubbers and they can't get a capsule up to save you, say, for a month with the rockets they've got.
[02:52:27.248 --> 02:52:28.369]  That's usually how it is, a month or so.
[02:52:28.369 --> 02:52:31.309]  And you're going to run out of oxygen in three days.
[02:52:31.309 --> 02:52:37.911]  Well, they happen to have the computer chips, usually for everything on the ship, stored.
[02:52:39.775 --> 02:52:50.161]  And so if you don't go and find the proper motherboard, the proper chip outlay, and you don't put that in and test it and fire up the scrubbers, you're going to die in a couple days on the spacecraft.
[02:52:50.161 --> 02:52:51.601]  And that's what this is.
[02:52:51.601 --> 02:52:52.682]  I know their next plan.
[02:52:52.682 --> 02:52:53.863]  This is all I do.
[02:52:53.863 --> 02:52:54.703]  I dream now.
[02:52:54.703 --> 02:52:55.884]  I used to have normal dreams.
[02:52:55.884 --> 02:52:58.845]  My dreams all night are just politics and the New World Order and how to defeat them.
[02:52:58.845 --> 02:53:00.586]  And, you know, that's all I do 24-7.
[02:53:02.330 --> 02:53:04.972]  And I know this, up one side and down the other.
[02:53:04.972 --> 02:53:06.654]  I know exactly what they're going to do, what they're going to pull.
[02:53:06.654 --> 02:53:07.995]  I know how to beat them.
[02:53:07.995 --> 02:53:13.099]  And also know the bondage we're going into if we don't turn this around.
[02:53:13.099 --> 02:53:16.142]  These people crave power over your mind.
[02:53:16.142 --> 02:53:18.284]  They crave making you desperate and poor.
[02:53:18.284 --> 02:53:21.046]  These are abjectly evil people.
[02:53:21.046 --> 02:53:23.968]  I mean, Joe Biden is a manifestation of a demon.
[02:53:23.968 --> 02:53:25.129]  His son is.
[02:53:25.129 --> 02:53:30.094]  Kamala Harris is a giggling, snickering monster that couldn't even get one-tenth of one percent
[02:53:30.814 --> 02:53:35.816]  Of the Democrats who support her because she's outrageously criminal.
[02:53:35.816 --> 02:53:43.180]  But the system chose her because it's empty like they are.
[02:53:43.180 --> 02:53:45.961]  Literal sellouts that have proven they're compromised.
[02:53:45.961 --> 02:53:50.383]  They don't know who they are and they'll do anything and that's who they choose.
[02:53:50.383 --> 02:53:54.925]  And I told all of you, I said, don't take
[02:53:56.752 --> 02:54:02.734]  How disgusting Kamala Harris is, and how disgusting Joe Biden is, and think they look weak and think they're easy to defeat.
[02:54:02.734 --> 02:54:04.375]  That's the sucker punch.
[02:54:04.375 --> 02:54:07.076]  And I told you.
[02:54:07.076 --> 02:54:08.837]  But we're not giving up, we're not giving in.
[02:54:08.837 --> 02:54:11.338]  If they had won it fair and square, I wouldn't care.
[02:54:11.338 --> 02:54:13.379]  But no, they stole it.
[02:54:13.379 --> 02:54:14.999]  And so we have to resist it.
[02:54:14.999 --> 02:54:16.020]  And they're horrible globalists.
[02:54:17.651 --> 02:54:20.933]  So, the War Room's coming up today with Harrison Smith for about an hour.
[02:54:20.933 --> 02:54:21.593]  Owen will be on it.
[02:54:21.593 --> 02:54:23.294]  He's about to launch Caravan.
[02:54:23.294 --> 02:54:24.715]  Five o'clock is when people gather.
[02:54:24.715 --> 02:54:25.976]  Five-thirty or so when it leaves.
[02:54:25.976 --> 02:54:28.017]  Texas Capitol, Southside.
[02:54:28.017 --> 02:54:33.441]  And if everybody joins that Caravan, and if there's tens of thousands of vehicles that end up showing up in DC, it'll be amazing.
[02:54:33.441 --> 02:54:35.062]  If a thousand show up, it's still beautiful.
[02:54:35.062 --> 02:54:39.884]  But if you want to take action, now's the time to be a walking, traveling billboard for truth.
[02:54:39.884 --> 02:54:41.726]  Stop the steel Caravan.
[02:54:41.726 --> 02:54:43.487]  Starts at 8 p.m.
[02:54:43.487 --> 02:54:44.387]  in Houston, Texas.
[02:54:44.387 --> 02:54:46.188]  It's the second leg.
[02:54:46.188 --> 02:54:47.129]  Leaving from Austin.
[02:54:48.821 --> 02:54:49.822]  Come on, come on, come on.
[02:55:19.602 --> 02:55:21.884]  Come on, come on.
[02:55:21.884 --> 02:55:23.926]  You didn't think freedom'd be free.
[02:55:23.926 --> 02:55:27.249]  You didn't think we'd put Trump in there and there wouldn't be a giant fight over it.
[02:55:27.249 --> 02:55:28.890]  No, we looked for this.
[02:55:28.890 --> 02:55:29.811]  We asked for the fight.
[02:55:29.811 --> 02:55:30.992]  They started it.
[02:55:30.992 --> 02:55:32.434]  Now we're getting one.
[02:55:32.434 --> 02:55:33.995]  That's okay.
[02:55:33.995 --> 02:55:37.939]  Paul Watson's report's coming up in Gerald Cilente, NewsWars.com.
[02:55:41.485 --> 02:55:48.669]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and worshipped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations.
[02:55:48.669 --> 02:55:52.230]  But with modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular.
[02:55:52.230 --> 02:55:59.254]  Its antioxidant effect, its anti-inflammatory effect, everything it does is simply amazing.
[02:55:59.254 --> 02:56:02.776]  And most turmerics out there are simply food products.
[02:56:02.776 --> 02:56:05.877]  They're 3-5% curcuminoid.
[02:56:05.877 --> 02:56:08.819]  But we have body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:56:09.759 --> 02:56:10.140]  We're good to go.
[02:56:32.343 --> 02:56:34.024]  And that's not gonna leave it!
[02:56:34.024 --> 02:56:34.644]  It's show go time!
[02:57:06.336 --> 02:57:12.562]  They're gonna need to send in the National Guard, a fucking SWAT team, cause I ain't going nowhere!
[02:57:16.607 --> 02:57:30.893]  There's no greater irony than the same people who for four years tried to delegitimize an election result with baseless conspiracy theories, then accusing the Trump campaign of trying to delegitimize an election result with baseless conspiracy theories.
[02:57:30.893 --> 02:57:32.053]  You don't get to do that.
[02:57:32.053 --> 02:57:41.177]  You spent four years relentlessly trying to subvert the office of president, then cry foul when the Trump campaign demands a legally transparent vote count.
[02:57:41.257 --> 02:57:42.597]  You don't get to do that!
[02:57:42.597 --> 02:57:45.698]  You know what the mainstream media also doesn't get to do?
[02:57:45.698 --> 02:57:46.858]  Decide elections!
[02:57:46.858 --> 02:57:50.359]  The role of declaring the winner of a presidential election in the U.S.
[02:57:50.359 --> 02:57:52.159]  falls to the news media!
[02:57:52.159 --> 02:57:53.659]  No, it fucking doesn't!
[02:57:53.659 --> 02:57:54.839]  Oh my goodness!
[02:57:54.839 --> 02:57:57.440]  All the networks!
[02:57:57.440 --> 02:57:59.300]  Wow!
[02:57:59.300 --> 02:58:01.841]  All the networks!
[02:58:01.841 --> 02:58:04.261]  We have to forget about the law!
[02:58:04.261 --> 02:58:07.182]  Judges don't count!
[02:58:07.182 --> 02:58:08.702]  All the networks, all the networks!
[02:58:10.776 --> 02:58:12.597]  Well, the network thought Biden was gonna win by 10%.
[02:58:12.597 --> 02:58:14.799]  Gee, what happened?
[02:58:14.799 --> 02:58:19.563]  But it's not like they didn't tell you what they were going to do in advance.
[02:58:19.563 --> 02:58:23.286]  And you have a model scenario called the Red Mirage.
[02:58:23.286 --> 02:58:24.506]  What does that mean?
[02:58:24.506 --> 02:58:28.169]  On election night, we are going to see Donald Trump in a stronger position.
[02:58:28.169 --> 02:58:32.392]  The data is going to show on election night an incredible victory for Donald Trump.
[02:58:32.392 --> 02:58:39.298]  When every legitimate vote is tallied and we get to that final day, which will be someday after election day, it will in fact show
[02:58:40.111 --> 02:58:44.512]  That what happened on election night was exactly that, a mirage.
[02:58:44.512 --> 02:58:47.973]  It looked like Donald Trump was in the lead.
[02:58:47.973 --> 02:58:50.054]  And he fundamentally was not.
[02:58:50.054 --> 02:58:52.274]  When every ballot gets counted.
[02:58:52.274 --> 02:58:59.176]  Biden got fewer votes than Obama or Hillary in every state except Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin.
[02:58:59.176 --> 02:59:00.577]  Hmm, funny that, isn't it?
[02:59:00.577 --> 02:59:05.258]  Seems about as normal as a 77-year-old man sniffing a random six-year-old girl's hair.
[02:59:06.744 --> 02:59:08.225]  Totally normal!
[02:59:08.225 --> 02:59:19.129]  We have put together, I think, the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.
[02:59:19.129 --> 02:59:27.152]  Google Trends searches for election fraud punishment surged in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Arizona before election.
[02:59:27.152 --> 02:59:29.052]  What a stunning coincidence!
[02:59:29.052 --> 02:59:30.553]  I wonder why that could...
[02:59:31.013 --> 02:59:32.514]  Possibly be!
[02:59:32.514 --> 02:59:37.119]  Numbers of people who voted only for Joe Biden and didn't vote further down the ticket.
[02:59:37.119 --> 02:59:37.779]  Pennsylvania, 98,000.
[02:59:37.779 --> 02:59:38.139]  Georgia, 80 to 90,000.
[02:59:38.139 --> 02:59:38.320]  Arizona, 42,000.
[02:59:38.320 --> 02:59:38.760]  Michigan, 69 to 115,000.
[02:59:38.760 --> 02:59:39.220]  Wisconsin, 62,836.
[02:59:39.220 --> 02:59:39.621]  Seems legit.
[02:59:39.621 --> 02:59:44.725]  We've identified at least 450,000 ballots in the key states that miraculously only have a mark for Joe Biden on them and no other candidate.
[02:59:57.978 --> 03:00:02.687]  At least Republican poll watchers were allowed to observe them all being countered.
[03:00:08.835 --> 03:00:09.355]  Oh.
[03:00:09.355 --> 03:00:11.916]  Still, at least we're allowed to talk about this.
[03:00:11.916 --> 03:00:21.498]  At least social media companies didn't implement policies months before anticipating this very scenario so they could then censor whistleblowers.
[03:00:21.498 --> 03:00:22.718]  Uh... Oh.
[03:00:22.718 --> 03:00:26.879]  Look, it's time to just accept that Biden won fair and square.
[03:00:26.879 --> 03:00:29.639]  His voters were way more committed to the cause.
[03:00:29.639 --> 03:00:32.920]  In some cases, going so far as returning from the dead to vote for him.
[03:00:33.100 --> 03:00:35.704]  You've got to give it up for that kind of enthusiasm!
[03:00:35.704 --> 03:00:45.317]  If Republicans are consistently unable to capture that key demographic, dead people, then they only have themselves to blame.
[03:00:49.295 --> 03:00:50.816]  Joe Biden out thanking voters.
[03:00:50.816 --> 03:00:54.357]  But seriously, are the courts going to save Trump?
[03:00:54.357 --> 03:01:02.040]  If you believe the system stole the election from him, then it's pretty naive that that same system is just going to hand it back.
[03:01:02.040 --> 03:01:04.481]  So let's say Trump fails in court and Biden wins.
[03:01:04.481 --> 03:01:05.401]  I don't fucking believe it!
[03:01:05.401 --> 03:01:10.123]  Let's say all those 4am magic ballots were totally legitimate.
[03:01:10.123 --> 03:01:11.124]  Who's to blame?
[03:01:11.124 --> 03:01:11.684]  The media.
[03:01:12.642 --> 03:01:16.885]  No, not the legacy media, the conservative media.
[03:01:16.885 --> 03:01:25.591]  Trump was basically the first president in history to run a campaign with barely any right-wing media outlets fighting his corner.
[03:01:25.591 --> 03:01:30.114]  The Drudge Report abandoned Trump and became indistinguishable from CNN.
[03:01:30.114 --> 03:01:38.079]  Fox News was so eager to call states early for Biden, they were like a giddy child waiting to open his gifts at 6am on Christmas Day.
[03:01:38.079 --> 03:01:40.320]  Only Ben Shapiro threw in the towel quicker.
[03:01:40.320 --> 03:01:42.602]  Articles like this one in The Spectator
[03:01:42.642 --> 03:01:44.684]  I'm voting to make America boring again!
[03:01:44.684 --> 03:01:47.366]  You think they're just gonna let you get on with your lives?
[03:01:47.366 --> 03:01:49.428]  You think everything's gonna return to normal?
[03:02:06.104 --> 03:02:07.224]  Is that normal?
[03:02:07.224 --> 03:02:13.605]  Returning to the fantastic policy of carpet bombing the Middle East to install Islamist dictators.
[03:02:13.605 --> 03:02:14.465]  Is that normal?
[03:02:14.465 --> 03:02:16.626]  Critical race theory brainwashing.
[03:02:16.626 --> 03:02:21.567]  Marxist re-education and social engineering of a generation.
[03:02:21.567 --> 03:02:22.507]  Is that normal?
[03:02:22.507 --> 03:02:29.888]  Handing political capital and influence to the same thugs who've been burning down American cities for the past six months.
[03:02:29.888 --> 03:02:30.628]  Is that normal?
[03:02:30.628 --> 03:02:34.689]  Just because you've cooked for Biden, you don't think they're going to demand more?
[03:02:41.326 --> 03:02:44.987]  Oh, but at least we won't have to defend Trump's impulsive tweets.
[03:02:44.987 --> 03:02:48.468]  What kind of putridly pathetic cowardice is that?
[03:02:48.468 --> 03:02:51.409]  Oh, but under Biden, the country will be brought back together.
[03:02:51.409 --> 03:02:54.090]  He's going to heal and unify the nation.
[03:02:54.090 --> 03:02:57.111]  A nation united, a nation strengthened, a nation healed.
[03:02:57.111 --> 03:02:59.291]  Putting Republicans on lists.
[03:02:59.291 --> 03:03:01.772]  Demanding, quote, pain for Trump supporters.
[03:03:01.912 --> 03:03:07.253]  Saying Trump supporters who want a fair vote count should be barred from future employment.
[03:03:07.253 --> 03:03:12.194]  Threatening to burn down and level the opposition, leaving no survivors.
[03:03:12.194 --> 03:03:17.215]  It's not only that Trump has to lose, but that all his enablers have to lose.
[03:03:17.215 --> 03:03:21.295]  We have to collectively, in essence, burn down the Republican Party.
[03:03:21.295 --> 03:03:22.636]  We have to level them.
[03:03:22.636 --> 03:03:28.296]  Because if there are survivors, if there are people who weather this storm, they will do it again.
[03:03:28.296 --> 03:03:31.057]  Yeah, that doesn't sound like healing rhetoric to me.
[03:03:31.277 --> 03:03:35.479]  We get enough power in the media, and I'm gonna steamroll these sons of b****es.
[03:03:35.479 --> 03:03:36.780]  I'm gonna steamroll them.
[03:03:36.780 --> 03:03:39.021]  We're gonna slaughter the Republicans politically.
[03:03:39.021 --> 03:03:42.542]  Let us hit the Republicans in the face!
[03:03:42.542 --> 03:03:43.623]  2016, Trump won.
[03:03:43.623 --> 03:03:47.645]  He's going to execute all gay and trans people and become a fascist!
[03:03:47.645 --> 03:03:50.726]  2020, punish those who disagree with me and participate in democracy.
[03:03:50.726 --> 03:03:51.567]  Yay, healing!
[03:03:58.704 --> 03:03:59.305]  Unity?
[03:03:59.305 --> 03:04:02.309]  You really think these kind of people are just gonna let you be?
[03:04:02.309 --> 03:04:05.913]  They're already back out on the streets harassing diners.
[03:04:05.913 --> 03:04:09.758]  This isn't just about seizing power, it's about demoralizing a nation.
[03:04:09.758 --> 03:04:14.003]  Many conservatives are now saying they'll never bother voting again after what happened.
[03:04:14.003 --> 03:04:17.508]  It's about making you feel powerless, disenfranchised.
[03:04:17.828 --> 03:04:18.528]  Hopeless.
[03:04:18.528 --> 03:04:22.849]  And suddenly Covid's taken a few days off so they can all have street parties.
[03:04:22.849 --> 03:04:26.530]  You don't get to attend your grandma's funeral because it's too dangerous.
[03:04:26.530 --> 03:04:29.551]  You get screeched at if you get within six feet of them.
[03:04:29.551 --> 03:04:36.533]  But they can all gather in close proximity for a super spreader event and the media affords it endless adulation.
[03:04:36.533 --> 03:04:38.173]  And what are they celebrating?
[03:04:38.173 --> 03:04:39.754]  The end of Trumpism?
[03:04:39.754 --> 03:04:41.334]  The end of populism?
[03:04:41.334 --> 03:04:43.875]  The end of America first nationalism?
[03:04:43.875 --> 03:04:44.575]  Newsflash!
[03:04:44.995 --> 03:04:49.058]  None of that's going anywhere, whether Trump's in the White House or not.
[03:04:49.058 --> 03:04:53.462]  3 million more Americans legitimately voted for it than in 2016.
[03:04:53.462 --> 03:04:55.123]  Hardly a blue wave, is it?
[03:04:55.123 --> 03:04:56.745]  Hardly a repudiation.
[03:04:56.745 --> 03:05:07.934]  Also, speaking of celebrations, the same media that we're supposed to trust with the power to anoint a president, claimed that 5th of November fireworks in the UK, an annual celebration,
[03:05:08.314 --> 03:05:11.296]  Was actually people celebrating Biden winning.
[03:05:11.296 --> 03:05:12.957]  Hey Siri, what's bonfire night?
[03:05:12.957 --> 03:05:17.380]  CNN also lied in claiming church bells rang out in Paris in praise of Biden.
[03:05:17.380 --> 03:05:20.122]  The church released a statement saying otherwise.
[03:05:20.122 --> 03:05:24.464]  Deliberately fake news designed to bolster Biden's legitimacy.
[03:05:24.464 --> 03:05:29.307]  Now suddenly, less than a week after the election, we have a COVID vaccine!
[03:05:29.307 --> 03:05:32.029]  Another stunningly timed coincidence.
[03:05:32.029 --> 03:05:34.711]  Now Biden has his coronavirus task force.
[03:05:35.171 --> 03:05:39.173]  Now he can take credit for saving the world from the pandemic.
[03:05:39.173 --> 03:05:40.974]  Such perfect timing!
[03:05:40.974 --> 03:05:43.756]  Did the Trump campaign make mistakes?
[03:05:43.756 --> 03:05:44.676]  Without a doubt.
[03:05:44.676 --> 03:05:46.177]  Pandering to Israel.
[03:05:46.177 --> 03:05:50.359]  For all his pro-Israel stuff, more Muslims than Jews voted for Trump.
[03:05:50.359 --> 03:05:51.920]  Pandering to minorities.
[03:05:51.920 --> 03:05:55.582]  So Trump got an extra 2% of the black vote compared to 2016.
[03:05:55.582 --> 03:06:02.286]  This is continually lauded by MAGA types who are still obsessed with not having the media call them racist.
[03:06:02.486 --> 03:06:03.407]  And at what cost?
[03:06:03.407 --> 03:06:06.728]  Democrats still got 90% of the black vote.
[03:06:06.728 --> 03:06:10.791]  Trump the racist won more minority votes than any GOP candidate since 1960.
[03:06:10.791 --> 03:06:14.593]  Yeah, but if it turns out he's still lost, so what?
[03:06:14.593 --> 03:06:18.555]  We may have lost the White House, but at least the media can't call us racists.
[03:06:18.555 --> 03:06:19.516]  Who cares?
[03:06:19.516 --> 03:06:28.601]  How much energy did pro-Trump organisations waste in desperately trying to prove they weren't racist instead of using that energy to enlist actual voters?
[03:06:28.601 --> 03:06:29.482]  They hate you.
[03:06:29.482 --> 03:06:31.203]  They're going to call you racist anyway.
[03:06:32.023 --> 03:06:32.744]  Who cares?
[03:06:32.744 --> 03:06:36.347]  Whatever happens in the next few weeks, I think one thing's for certain.
[03:06:36.347 --> 03:06:40.851]  There are going to be quite a few more plot twists before this thing is said and done.
[03:06:40.851 --> 03:06:55.244]  Election 2020 is here, and whether Trump wins or loses, we have all won by exposing the communist Chinese, by exposing the globalists, by exposing the pedophile rings, by exposing the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil.
[03:06:56.125 --> 03:07:00.569]  I'm personally a Christian and I believe in God and I know God's real and I've experienced it in my life.
[03:07:00.569 --> 03:07:05.854]  But even if you don't believe in God, it's important to recognize that there is good in this world, there is evil.
[03:07:05.854 --> 03:07:10.058]  And there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing bad.
[03:07:10.058 --> 03:07:19.307]  And what I see happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally get that, they finally understand that they're not being naive anymore.
[03:07:19.927 --> 03:07:29.173]  Don't ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven what they stand for and who they are, or you're going to get hurt.
[03:07:29.173 --> 03:07:37.679]  But those of you out there that have done your own research and discovered who's good and who is faithful, well then come together with those organizations and support them like InfoWars.
[03:07:37.679 --> 03:07:43.864]  Without your support, InfoWars would not exist.
[03:07:43.864 --> 03:07:46.485]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:07.060 --> 03:08:12.046]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:12.046 --> 03:08:16.731]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:32.822 --> 03:08:33.242]  Hello, hello!
[03:08:33.242 --> 03:08:37.586]  Yeah, this is an Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:37.586 --> 03:08:39.367]  You look a lot alike.
[03:08:39.367 --> 03:08:44.070]  About the same age, same size, so we got a little confused.
[03:08:44.070 --> 03:08:45.992]  But here we are!
[03:08:45.992 --> 03:08:47.753]  Wow.
[03:08:47.753 --> 03:08:52.456]  Again, we had called it for a Trump victory, and too close to call.
[03:08:52.456 --> 03:08:53.697]  That was in our Trends Journal.
[03:08:53.697 --> 03:08:57.740]  It went out last Tuesday before the polls closed.
[03:08:57.740 --> 03:08:58.761]  And we were right.
[03:08:58.761 --> 03:09:01.663]  It was too close to call, and it looks like a Trump victory.
[03:09:02.640 --> 03:09:05.621]  We went against all the odds.
[03:09:05.621 --> 03:09:22.683]  And as Trump and others have pointed out, the odds are that by them saying that Trump was going to lose by 10 points, most of the polls between 8 and 10 points, that's suppression.
[03:09:22.683 --> 03:09:26.644]  Just like Mr. Watson was saying, a lot of people won't go out and vote now.
[03:09:26.644 --> 03:09:27.464]  And that's what they did.
[03:09:27.464 --> 03:09:29.005]  People said, what am I going to go out to vote for?
[03:09:29.005 --> 03:09:31.325]  This guy doesn't have a shot, even though I'm for him.
[03:09:31.971 --> 03:09:33.132]  He's not going anywhere.
[03:09:33.132 --> 03:09:36.235]  I'm not going to, I'm not going to, I'm not going to go out and vote.
[03:09:36.235 --> 03:09:41.739]  So it was overt, overt suppression right in front of our eyes.
[03:09:41.739 --> 03:09:45.842]  So let's get this straight, everybody.
[03:09:45.842 --> 03:09:54.329]  You pick up the Trends Journal, go back to last May and August of 2016.
[03:09:54.329 --> 03:10:00.955]  Right there in black and white, we said, despite the polls, Donald Trump was going to win the election.
[03:10:01.943 --> 03:10:09.607]  And everybody that listens to me on InfoWars or anywhere else knows I'm a political atheist.
[03:10:09.607 --> 03:10:15.230]  I look at things for the way they are, not the way I want them to be.
[03:10:15.230 --> 03:10:19.372]  So we called it back then when the polls were wrong.
[03:10:19.372 --> 03:10:22.954]  The polls were grossly wrong again this time.
[03:10:22.954 --> 03:10:27.677]  But yet, day after day, for some 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 months,
[03:10:31.604 --> 03:10:32.504]  Trump down by 10%.
[03:10:32.504 --> 03:10:34.545]  Trump down by 10%.
[03:10:34.545 --> 03:10:40.946]  And that other one, that phony name one, they got 25-6-3, whatever it is.
[03:10:40.946 --> 03:10:46.788]  You know, they got a 1% chance of winning.
[03:10:46.788 --> 03:10:51.629]  The polls are an antiquated system.
[03:10:51.629 --> 03:10:54.369]  Back in the 1990s, late 1990s, some 36% of the people would respond to a pollster's call.
[03:11:02.173 --> 03:11:08.577]  In the new digital age, when you see who's calling and you don't want to look at it, you're looking at 6%.
[03:11:08.577 --> 03:11:13.820]  So they're getting a very skewed market.
[03:11:13.820 --> 03:11:17.963]  It's an antiquated system.
[03:11:17.963 --> 03:11:23.566]  But yet that's being shoved down our throats.
[03:11:23.566 --> 03:11:29.170]  And then the other reality to all of this is that
[03:11:32.523 --> 03:11:59.027]  If Trump won the election and Biden lost in the swing states as Trump did, all the demo craps would be screaming for a recount, a new election, fraud.
[03:12:00.319 --> 03:12:02.561]  And again, I don't have to go into the details.
[03:12:02.561 --> 03:12:10.306]  I mean, on InfoWars, you've been getting the details left and right, inside out, upside down, backwards and sideways.
[03:12:10.306 --> 03:12:26.597]  So you know whether it comes from Ken Starr, Pennsylvania ballot extension, the constitutional travesty and going on and on about what a fraud this whole thing is.
[03:12:26.597 --> 03:12:30.059]  And then you look at it and this is
[03:12:30.988 --> 03:12:34.249]  Biden's home state.
[03:12:34.249 --> 03:12:42.690]  And as everybody knows, on election day and election eve, he was losing big time.
[03:12:42.690 --> 03:12:44.911]  And all of a sudden, all these ballots came in.
[03:12:44.911 --> 03:12:52.692]  And as Mr. Watson showed, oh, yeah, you can view them and they close it up so you can't see anything.
[03:12:52.692 --> 03:12:58.053]  They put all that paper over everything.
[03:12:58.053 --> 03:12:58.153]  And
[03:13:00.151 --> 03:13:02.653]  The fraud is right in front of our face.
[03:13:02.653 --> 03:13:05.595]  So here's the deal.
[03:13:05.595 --> 03:13:14.882]  If this happened in another country, under the Obama administration, which is now back in power.
[03:13:14.882 --> 03:13:17.725]  So let's get this straight, everybody.
[03:13:17.725 --> 03:13:22.128]  It ain't out of his mind Biden.
[03:13:22.128 --> 03:13:28.233]  He's bringing back the entire, a lot of the Obama murderous team from that guy, Blinken.
[03:13:29.253 --> 03:13:50.587]  Who went to Saudi Arabia when they started the Yemen War, which was launched from the White House, excuse me, Washington DC, when the Saudis launched it, to Samantha Power, to Susan Rice.
[03:13:50.587 --> 03:13:55.190]  One after another, they're bringing them all back.
[03:13:58.621 --> 03:14:03.224]  So now what we have is the murderous Obama team.
[03:14:03.224 --> 03:14:26.219]  So if this election happened in Libya, and it was up for count, and Qaddafi was losing, the Nobel piece of crap prize winner you just saw there, the murderous Obama should be brought up on war crime tribunal along with murderous George W. Bush and the rest of the gangs that support it with lies.
[03:14:27.346 --> 03:14:30.029]  You know, we've got to invade this country.
[03:14:30.029 --> 03:14:32.671]  They just had an election over there.
[03:14:32.671 --> 03:14:40.078]  You see how, you see the joke about the ballots and how they were counted in all these different states?
[03:14:40.078 --> 03:14:43.021]  We've got to go invade that country.
[03:14:43.021 --> 03:14:50.428]  That's what they'd be screaming over here, over there, to come invade over here.
[03:14:50.428 --> 03:14:52.690]  That's what America does to all these other countries.
[03:14:54.037 --> 03:14:57.019]  Oh, I don't like that Venezuelan election.
[03:14:57.019 --> 03:14:59.361]  Let's go after them.
[03:14:59.361 --> 03:15:03.483]  I don't like what they did in Sudan.
[03:15:03.483 --> 03:15:05.224]  One country after another.
[03:15:05.224 --> 03:15:07.145]  Iraq.
[03:15:07.145 --> 03:15:08.987]  Iran.
[03:15:08.987 --> 03:15:11.488]  You name the country.
[03:15:11.488 --> 03:15:13.149]  America.
[03:15:13.149 --> 03:15:22.095]  When they don't like the joint, it's an excuse to invade because of their corrupt political elections.
[03:15:22.995 --> 03:15:30.541]  Welcome to the U.S.S.A., the United Soviet States of America.
[03:15:30.541 --> 03:15:32.822]  Here we are.
[03:15:32.822 --> 03:15:37.786]  This is a disgrace in front of everybody's eyes.
[03:15:37.786 --> 03:15:42.210]  And I'm up here in liberal land.
[03:15:42.210 --> 03:15:44.892]  They won't admit to the lies.
[03:15:44.892 --> 03:15:47.994]  All they're happy about is that Biden won.
[03:15:51.035 --> 03:15:52.236]  Forget the fraud.
[03:15:52.236 --> 03:15:53.637]  There you go.
[03:15:53.637 --> 03:15:55.798]  United Soviet States of America.
[03:15:55.798 --> 03:16:00.141]  That's from your Trends Journal going back a couple of months ago.
[03:16:00.141 --> 03:16:04.383]  Now we're all going to be masked up.
[03:16:04.383 --> 03:16:07.405]  Vaccinated, masked.
[03:16:07.405 --> 03:16:08.446]  Biden control.
[03:16:08.446 --> 03:16:14.389]  And a good 50 percent of the people are supporting it.
[03:16:14.389 --> 03:16:18.572]  And as Alex Jones said, you better stand up and fight and do what you can.
[03:16:19.517 --> 03:16:22.638]  Unless you want to live the Soviet way.
[03:16:22.638 --> 03:16:24.439]  Because now it's guaranteed.
[03:16:24.439 --> 03:16:26.539]  They're in power.
[03:16:26.539 --> 03:16:28.120]  They're in office.
[03:16:28.120 --> 03:16:31.001]  The murderous Obama team is back.
[03:16:31.001 --> 03:16:32.881]  We're going to be back in a little bit.
[03:16:32.881 --> 03:16:35.162]  And remember, do what you can to support it.
[03:16:39.013 --> 03:16:39.793]  Warning!
[03:16:39.793 --> 03:16:40.534]  Warning!
[03:16:40.534 --> 03:16:41.374]  Warning!
[03:16:41.374 --> 03:16:56.962]  There is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover, the giant third world collapse, and a new world war that is going to be triggered by the new COVID lockdown announced by globalist systems in Europe, in Asia, and now in the United States.
[03:16:57.942 --> 03:17:13.490]  Joe Biden is set to announce today that he has a new COVID task force that is calling for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude, contact tracing, forced inoculations coming, but most importantly, a new lockdown.
[03:17:13.490 --> 03:17:19.994]  That way he can say that Trump is to blame for COVID and claim that only a new lockdown will stop COVID.
[03:17:20.754 --> 03:17:26.756]  Then, of course, when that new lockdown doesn't work, those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it.
[03:17:26.756 --> 03:17:30.317]  And that's when all the mass arrests start, sometime towards the end of next year.
[03:17:30.317 --> 03:17:33.498]  This is a permanent martial law plan.
[03:17:33.498 --> 03:17:38.360]  Trump must repudiate it, expose Fauci and Gates, and the UN takeover, not play games with it.
[03:17:39.008 --> 03:17:44.315]  DNA Force Plus, if you did one thing for your immune system, it would be get all the essential things.
[03:17:44.315 --> 03:17:46.658]  And that's the clean iodine, X2 or X3.
[03:17:46.658 --> 03:17:48.280]  That's the biotrichoselenium.
[03:17:48.280 --> 03:17:49.802]  That is the vitamin D3.
[03:17:49.802 --> 03:17:51.664]  That is the C. That is the zinc.
[03:17:51.664 --> 03:17:53.907]  There's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential without them you die.
[03:17:53.907 --> 03:17:55.369]  And studies show you really need the other ones too.
[03:17:55.469 --> 03:17:56.950]  But DNA Force goes beyond that.
[03:17:56.950 --> 03:18:08.518]  It helps get all that in the cells and out the cells with PQQ and CoQ10, the highest quality sources, with other ingredients that clean out the cells, that unclog them so all that stuff can get in.
[03:18:08.518 --> 03:18:09.558]  Viruses don't get in.
[03:18:09.558 --> 03:18:10.599]  The good stuff gets in.
[03:18:10.599 --> 03:18:14.702]  As the NIH website says, if you have all the proper things, they can't replicate like they could.
[03:18:14.702 --> 03:18:17.304]  But I do this because it's essential, like oxygen, like water.
[03:18:25.469 --> 03:18:29.251]  That's going to have to end in a week because we had a limited supply and it was very hard to get the PQQ this time.
[03:18:29.251 --> 03:18:30.751]  A lot of our stuff can't get anymore.
[03:18:30.751 --> 03:18:32.812]  A lot of our products because the supply chain is broken down.
[03:18:32.812 --> 03:18:33.872]  That's part of the Globalist plan.
[03:18:33.872 --> 03:18:35.693]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:18:35.693 --> 03:18:39.255]  I want to thank you all for tuning in.
[03:18:39.255 --> 03:18:44.677]  For those drinking the Globalist Kool-Aid, what I call the Invincibly Ignorant, there is no hope.
[03:18:44.677 --> 03:18:48.899]  But for those of you that care and are informed, we have more than hope.
[03:18:48.899 --> 03:18:53.240]  We have history on our side if we take action and if we spread the truth.
[03:18:53.240 --> 03:18:54.541]  I have been warning everyone.
[03:18:55.141 --> 03:18:58.245]  Of exactly what was going to come in the exact order.
[03:18:58.245 --> 03:18:59.206]  How did I do that?
[03:18:59.206 --> 03:19:04.751]  Because the globalists war game it all in public and prepare the public with brainwashing on MSM.
[03:19:04.751 --> 03:19:10.157]  When they put out the 80 million ballots, we knew it was so they could stuff it after the polls closed.
[03:19:10.157 --> 03:19:15.002]  That's why they got federal courts to rule to keep it open for weeks if need be.
[03:19:15.002 --> 03:19:16.103]  Again, it was so simple.
[03:19:16.764 --> 03:19:20.725]  And of course, you see the media heat up saying Trump did a bad job on COVID.
[03:19:20.725 --> 03:19:28.967]  And that once Biden was, quote, President-elect, he would order Trump to admit that he did a bad job and admit that he needs a second lockdown.
[03:19:28.967 --> 03:19:35.209]  And if he doesn't go under Biden's immediate control and put that lockdown in place, he'll try to remove the President with the 25th Amendment.
[03:19:35.209 --> 03:19:41.890]  And all of that is to trick Trump to take the blame for COVID that's Chinese.
[03:19:41.890 --> 03:19:44.511]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:01.624 --> 03:20:03.545]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:20:03.545 --> 03:20:15.673]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Celente.
[03:20:15.673 --> 03:20:20.096]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.096 --> 03:20:29.883]  Remember, particularly in these times, dreadful times, of the robbery of liberty, love, joy and beauty,
[03:20:30.776 --> 03:20:35.937]  Put your money where your heart and mind are and support InfoWars.
[03:20:35.937 --> 03:20:37.177]  I do.
[03:20:37.177 --> 03:20:39.578]  And here's one of my favorites.
[03:20:39.578 --> 03:20:45.979]  Supermail Vitality gives me that extra chip just when you need it.
[03:20:45.979 --> 03:20:49.440]  No, it's great stuff, especially for an old cat.
[03:20:49.440 --> 03:20:53.181]  So remember, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:20:53.181 --> 03:20:59.002]  They have their American Crisis Emergency Lockdown 2 is coming and
[03:21:00.407 --> 03:21:12.556]  The economic collapse in Biden's martial law disguises lockdown too, so up to 60% off, plus free shipping and triple Patriot Points storewide.
[03:21:12.556 --> 03:21:25.325]  And they have decided to launch these emergency sales on InfoWarsStores.com as the Republic's is on death's doorstep as she's fighting for her life.
[03:21:25.325 --> 03:21:28.267]  So they're hoping and praying, we all are, for the best.
[03:21:28.951 --> 03:21:30.152]  But prepare for the worst.
[03:21:30.152 --> 03:21:30.933]  I always say that.
[03:21:30.933 --> 03:21:31.874]  Prepare for the worst.
[03:21:31.874 --> 03:21:34.336]  If the worst doesn't happen, you don't lose anything.
[03:21:34.336 --> 03:21:38.200]  If the worst doesn't happen and you're not prepared for it, you lose everything.
[03:21:38.200 --> 03:21:47.308]  So you have DNA Force Plus, Alpha Plus, Alpha Power, Bodies, BioTruth, Selenium, Ultra 12, 50%.

[03:22:28.915 --> 03:22:31.315]  It's very important.
[03:22:31.315 --> 03:22:34.396]  Now, now, now, now, more than ever.
[03:22:34.396 --> 03:22:36.896]  You can see where this is going.
[03:22:36.896 --> 03:22:42.598]  All we are going to become plantation workers on the global plantation of Slavelandia.
[03:22:42.598 --> 03:22:46.919]  You see how happy that big tech is that Biden won.
[03:22:46.919 --> 03:22:48.939]  Well, did he win?
[03:22:48.939 --> 03:22:53.560]  That election was rigged to make it look like Biden won.
[03:22:54.790 --> 03:22:57.171]  And they're in control.
[03:22:57.171 --> 03:22:59.072]  Them and big media.
[03:22:59.072 --> 03:22:59.912]  This is terrible.
[03:22:59.912 --> 03:23:02.593]  This isn't my America.
[03:23:02.593 --> 03:23:05.354]  This isn't the America I was born into.
[03:23:05.354 --> 03:23:08.436]  This is disgraceful.
[03:23:08.436 --> 03:23:12.457]  And it's only going to get worse if we don't fight back.
[03:23:12.457 --> 03:23:16.919]  And you can't fight back without money.
[03:23:16.919 --> 03:23:20.301]  You know, look at Biden over there.
[03:23:20.301 --> 03:23:22.422]  Look at this guy.
[03:23:22.422 --> 03:23:23.342]  This is my president.
[03:23:24.292 --> 03:23:29.815]  This guy's been sucking off the public tit for almost 50 years, and all he's brought us is war.
[03:23:29.815 --> 03:23:34.797]  Oh, you like all those products that get made in China?
[03:23:34.797 --> 03:23:40.259]  Yeah, thank them, him, and the demo craps under Clinton.
[03:23:40.259 --> 03:23:43.521]  Yeah, NAFTA, the World Trade Organization, bringing China into that.
[03:23:43.521 --> 03:23:47.763]  NAFTA, shipping our jobs off to Mexico for slave labor.
[03:23:47.763 --> 03:23:50.204]  And people voted for this guy?
[03:23:50.204 --> 03:23:52.525]  It wasn't a war that he didn't love?
[03:23:54.701 --> 03:23:56.602]  That's a freak show.
[03:23:56.602 --> 03:23:59.483]  And we got a freak right in front of us.
[03:23:59.483 --> 03:24:01.664]  A lying freak.
[03:24:01.664 --> 03:24:09.448]  And again, you know the deal, how the hunted Biden info was banned by big media.
[03:24:09.448 --> 03:24:10.408]  And look at all these people.
[03:24:10.408 --> 03:24:14.650]  Look at them all waving and holding masks, with their masks on.
[03:24:14.650 --> 03:24:16.551]  Look at this freak show.
[03:24:16.551 --> 03:24:19.152]  Look at this freak show.
[03:24:19.152 --> 03:24:22.514]  They're going to look back at America, you know,
[03:24:23.685 --> 03:24:32.567]  50, 60 years from now and say, look at that Kamala Harris with her, she's all dressed up in that white with that black mask on.
[03:24:32.567 --> 03:24:34.287]  Why is she going black and white?
[03:24:34.287 --> 03:24:36.627]  Yeah.
[03:24:36.627 --> 03:24:38.408]  Look at this.
[03:24:38.408 --> 03:24:40.248]  Hey, how come you don't have your mask on, Biden?
[03:24:40.248 --> 03:24:41.208]  Everybody else does.
[03:24:41.208 --> 03:24:43.389]  You're going to get them all sick or you're going to get sick.
[03:24:43.389 --> 03:24:44.269]  How come he's not?
[03:24:44.269 --> 03:24:48.670]  If that was me out there, they'd get me off the stage.
[03:24:48.670 --> 03:24:49.930]  Look at these freaks.
[03:24:51.141 --> 03:24:55.043]  And you know when they're all together, they won't be wearing them.
[03:24:55.043 --> 03:24:57.305]  This is for show.
[03:24:57.305 --> 03:25:00.687]  And what a freak show it is.
[03:25:00.687 --> 03:25:04.529]  Now, look at this picture in today's Wall Street Journal.
[03:25:04.529 --> 03:25:05.309]  Look at this.
[03:25:05.309 --> 03:25:08.731]  Look at Harris up here with the mask on.
[03:25:08.731 --> 03:25:10.492]  That's what they're doing.
[03:25:10.492 --> 03:25:12.974]  They're getting us ready to be masked.
[03:25:12.974 --> 03:25:14.555]  You got it?
[03:25:14.555 --> 03:25:18.617]  It's right in front of your eyes.
[03:25:18.617 --> 03:25:19.818]  What state today?
[03:25:19.818 --> 03:25:20.358]  One of them just
[03:25:20.862 --> 03:25:24.705]  Put a mandatory mask wearing on.
[03:25:24.705 --> 03:25:30.130]  One after another.
[03:25:30.130 --> 03:25:30.590]  And again.
[03:25:30.590 --> 03:25:38.437]  Here's the mask that most people wear.
[03:25:38.437 --> 03:25:41.580]  And you read the box.
[03:25:41.580 --> 03:25:44.803]  These masks help protect against certain particular contaminants.
[03:25:45.720 --> 03:25:51.904]  But do not eliminate exposure to the risk of any disease or infection.
[03:25:51.904 --> 03:25:54.985]  Got it?
[03:25:54.985 --> 03:25:57.267]  It's control.
[03:25:57.267 --> 03:26:00.469]  It's for you to lose your identity.
[03:26:00.469 --> 03:26:05.251]  Mask mandates for all.
[03:26:05.251 --> 03:26:08.833]  And now the vaccination's coming.
[03:26:08.833 --> 03:26:14.877]  I saw it on InfoWars before I went on the air, but I had gotten it on Saturday.
[03:26:16.903 --> 03:26:31.310]  New York lawyers, New York Bar Association rejects religious, philosophical, or personal reason COVID-19 vaccination exemptions.
[03:26:31.310 --> 03:26:40.975]  The New York Bar Association, some slimy little arrogant boys and girls, shove your bar up your New York what?
[03:26:41.593 --> 03:26:43.694]  Your Bar Association.
[03:26:43.694 --> 03:26:46.795]  Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
[03:26:46.795 --> 03:26:50.557]  You can play arrogant with all the other little boys and girls.
[03:26:50.557 --> 03:26:53.138]  You're not gonna play it arrogant with me.
[03:26:53.138 --> 03:27:00.102]  I've been around enough lawyer liars freaks, so save your bar crap.
[03:27:00.102 --> 03:27:07.985]  Telling me I have to get a vaccination because you little pieces of crap are telling me to?
[03:27:07.985 --> 03:27:09.806]  Come over here and try to force me.
[03:27:10.956 --> 03:27:13.699]  And that's what's going to happen.
[03:27:13.699 --> 03:27:16.081]  The vaccination war has begun.
[03:27:16.081 --> 03:27:22.967]  They are going to force us to get vaccinated.
[03:27:22.967 --> 03:27:35.298]  As Watson pointed out, all of a sudden the vaccine comes out right after the votes are counted, fraudulently declared.
[03:27:35.298 --> 03:27:37.400]  Then they announce the vaccine comes out.
[03:27:40.822 --> 03:27:42.783]  How come it didn't even announce it last week?
[03:27:42.783 --> 03:27:46.344]  You think it just happened over the weekend?
[03:27:46.344 --> 03:27:50.206]  After they declared... Who declared?
[03:27:50.206 --> 03:27:51.466]  Nobody declared!
[03:27:51.466 --> 03:27:52.547]  The media declared!
[03:27:52.547 --> 03:27:54.608]  Who declared?
[03:27:54.608 --> 03:27:56.669]  BuzzFeed?
[03:27:56.669 --> 03:28:00.150]  How about BuzzCrap?
[03:28:00.150 --> 03:28:01.671]  AP?
[03:28:01.671 --> 03:28:06.753]  Associated Prestitutes?
[03:28:06.753 --> 03:28:09.174]  One after another, they're declaring what happened?
[03:28:11.710 --> 03:28:16.194]  Can't you see what's going on over here?
[03:28:16.194 --> 03:28:20.457]  Big Pharma.
[03:28:20.457 --> 03:28:25.462]  The Wall Street Gang.
[03:28:25.462 --> 03:28:29.105]  And the White Shoe Boys.
[03:28:29.105 --> 03:28:30.786]  Yeah.
[03:28:30.786 --> 03:28:34.489]  As I said, Obama's bringing back the old gang.
[03:28:34.489 --> 03:28:35.890]  Remember Holder?
[03:28:35.890 --> 03:28:38.613]  Yeah, the black guy in the White Shoe Gang.
[03:28:39.719 --> 03:28:45.801]  And again, I don't want anybody black, white, green, yellow, good and bad comes in all of them.
[03:28:45.801 --> 03:28:48.221]  Hey, look at Biden.
[03:28:48.221 --> 03:28:51.022]  He's white.
[03:28:51.022 --> 03:28:52.602]  Hold his back.
[03:28:52.602 --> 03:28:53.803]  Yep.
[03:28:53.803 --> 03:28:58.984]  After he left the Obama gang, went back to work with the white shoe gang.
[03:28:58.984 --> 03:29:01.525]  That's who's in charge.
[03:29:01.525 --> 03:29:04.105]  The banksters.
[03:29:04.105 --> 03:29:06.686]  The lawyers and big pharma.
[03:29:08.903 --> 03:29:09.563]  America?
[03:29:09.563 --> 03:29:12.285]  That's right.
[03:29:12.285 --> 03:29:12.985]  The Holder.
[03:29:12.985 --> 03:29:15.026]  Too big to jail.
[03:29:15.026 --> 03:29:18.127]  After they gave all the money to the banksters.
[03:29:18.127 --> 03:29:20.028]  Their criminal activities.
[03:29:20.028 --> 03:29:22.950]  There he is.
[03:29:22.950 --> 03:29:25.411]  So remember, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:29:25.411 --> 03:29:27.932]  And of course, the Trends Journal as well.
[03:29:27.932 --> 03:29:30.053]  No other magazine like it in the world.
[03:29:30.053 --> 03:29:31.794]  History before it happens.
[03:29:31.794 --> 03:29:32.394]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:38.490 --> 03:29:40.171]  Talk about tomorrow's news today.
[03:29:40.171 --> 03:29:43.954]  This is all very transparent when you war game it out.
[03:29:43.954 --> 03:29:49.638]  Six months ago, InfoWars predicted that the mail-in ballots would be used to steal the election from Trump.
[03:29:49.638 --> 03:29:57.684]  They would simply pause the voting at night and then have an unlimited number that they had in reserve to bring forward in battleground states to secure the victory.
[03:29:57.684 --> 03:29:58.825]  And now that happened.
[03:29:58.825 --> 03:30:03.828]  Now what else did I predict a few months ago and again last week and again last night, all on record?
[03:30:03.828 --> 03:30:05.930]  That when Joe Biden was president-elect,
[03:30:06.790 --> 03:30:08.652]  Via fraud, Trump would challenge it.
[03:30:08.652 --> 03:30:24.485]  But Biden's next move would be to form his own COVID task force, say that Trump is inept and has killed 267,000 Americans, which isn't true, and demand Trump's removal via the 25th Amendment if he doesn't let Joe Biden's new COVID task force give all the new orders.
[03:30:24.485 --> 03:30:29.109]  They'll tell Trump that if he backs down and follows their orders and steps down, they won't blame him for COVID.
[03:30:29.109 --> 03:30:30.811]  But if he does it, they're going to blame him for COVID.
[03:30:30.811 --> 03:30:33.213]  But then if he does do what they say, he's still going to blame them anyways.
[03:30:33.653 --> 03:30:36.095]  Plus, this is meant for martial law to destroy the economy.
[03:30:36.095 --> 03:30:38.777]  I warned you all.
[03:30:38.777 --> 03:30:43.941]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations, and different mixes of the two.
[03:30:43.941 --> 03:30:46.983]  One is born of renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[03:30:46.983 --> 03:30:55.309]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos, and a culture, and ingenuity, art, and skill, and strength.
[03:30:56.027 --> 03:31:02.394]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[03:31:02.394 --> 03:31:10.503]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[03:31:10.503 --> 03:31:14.107]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[03:31:14.107 --> 03:31:15.329]  They point out one of our evils.
[03:31:15.849 --> 03:31:18.931]  So they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[03:31:18.931 --> 03:31:20.672]  A global permanent lockdown is here.
[03:31:20.672 --> 03:31:24.074]  It's already causing millions and millions to starve to death.
[03:31:24.074 --> 03:31:26.235]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[03:31:26.235 --> 03:31:34.099]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[03:31:34.099 --> 03:31:34.900]  That's the facts.
[03:31:34.900 --> 03:31:36.861]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[03:31:39.127 --> 03:31:43.411]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed.
[03:31:43.411 --> 03:31:44.592]  And why is that?
[03:31:44.592 --> 03:31:52.400]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree-like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds.
[03:31:52.400 --> 03:31:56.904]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[03:31:56.904 --> 03:31:58.185]  They didn't know why.
[03:31:58.185 --> 03:32:03.931]  Well, with modern science we know it's one of the purest, cleanest organic forms of selenium.
[03:32:04.511 --> 03:32:15.995]  We have BioTrue Selenium, sold out for months, back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com at 50% off, store-wide free shipping, and triple patriot points.
[03:32:15.995 --> 03:32:25.518]  BioTrue Selenium at InfoWarsStore.com is an amazing product, and it's even more amazing in that it funds our operation.
[03:32:25.518 --> 03:32:28.019]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[03:32:28.019 --> 03:32:30.360]  It is an essential nutrient in the body
[03:32:30.740 --> 03:32:32.121]  You've absolutely have to have.
[03:32:32.121 --> 03:32:34.022]  It's back in stock, 50% off.
[03:32:34.022 --> 03:32:42.627]  Triple Patriot points and at 4sure.com and with free shipping.
[03:32:42.627 --> 03:32:43.368]  The days of hell.
[03:32:44.884 --> 03:32:47.785]  The nightmare is here.
[03:32:47.785 --> 03:32:51.006]  79 days of hell has begun!
[03:32:51.006 --> 03:33:10.914]  Multinational corporations, the mainstream media apparatus, and social media tech giants are all now being deployed by the archaic, inbred, crooked establishment to interfere with the 2020 US elections, remove the populist champion of the people, Donald J. Trump,
[03:33:11.454 --> 03:33:22.361]  And install the decrepit, perverted, traitorous establishment puppet Joe Biden, along with rabid radical hag Kamala Harris.
[03:33:22.361 --> 03:33:29.545]  Keep your heads on a swivel and tune in to 79days.news for tomorrow's news today.
[03:33:29.545 --> 03:33:32.406]  79days.news, America's last stand.
[03:33:32.406 --> 03:33:33.147]  79days.news.
[03:33:41.889 --> 03:33:59.244]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:59.244 --> 03:34:01.626]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:34:01.626 --> 03:34:04.368]  It's Gerald Cilente.
[03:34:04.368 --> 03:34:07.190]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:10.157 --> 03:34:12.679]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:12.679 --> 03:34:14.720]  What a time we're living in.
[03:34:14.720 --> 03:34:17.081]  Again, this is going to go down in history.
[03:34:17.081 --> 03:34:20.763]  You know, this is, it's disgusting what's happened.
[03:34:20.763 --> 03:34:23.005]  This is not my America.
[03:34:23.005 --> 03:34:25.946]  And you can see by the cover of the Trends Journal, I'm a political atheist.
[03:34:25.946 --> 03:34:28.008]  I don't take sides on things.
[03:34:28.008 --> 03:34:30.849]  And I call it what it is, a spade a spade.
[03:34:30.849 --> 03:34:31.550]  Oop!
[03:34:31.550 --> 03:34:32.550]  Can't say that anymore.
[03:34:32.550 --> 03:34:37.093]  I can say that now because Obama's out of office.
[03:34:37.093 --> 03:34:38.694]  Again, this is sexist and racist.
[03:34:40.285 --> 03:34:45.566]  Picking Kamala Harris, a black woman, half black and Indian.
[03:34:45.566 --> 03:34:47.527]  How about picking the best person?
[03:34:47.527 --> 03:34:52.888]  I could care less if they're black, white, green, yellow, transgender, inside out, upside down.
[03:34:52.888 --> 03:34:55.429]  And look how weak she is.
[03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:57.970]  She didn't bring the black vote in.
[03:34:57.970 --> 03:35:00.310]  To the contrary.
[03:35:00.310 --> 03:35:04.752]  So, this is the Harris.
[03:35:04.752 --> 03:35:05.852]  Biden will probably make it.
[03:35:05.852 --> 03:35:08.433]  They'll probably get rid of Biden before
[03:35:10.003 --> 03:35:14.886]  If he gets in there, they'll put him in.
[03:35:14.886 --> 03:35:20.290]  And then maybe three years in, he'll retire.
[03:35:20.290 --> 03:35:22.752]  She'll become president.
[03:35:22.752 --> 03:35:29.837]  And then there we go into 2024.
[03:35:29.837 --> 03:35:32.178]  So that's the way I see it happening if he comes in.
[03:35:32.178 --> 03:35:34.740]  And again, I don't know where this is going.
[03:35:34.740 --> 03:35:37.402]  Nobody really does with going to the Supreme Court.
[03:35:38.752 --> 03:35:48.117]  And if they do go, if it does go there, it does look like there is a lot of, again, InfoWars has all the information on the fraudulent election.
[03:35:48.117 --> 03:35:50.498]  It could be a Biden victory.
[03:35:50.498 --> 03:35:53.539]  That's where we are so far.
[03:35:53.539 --> 03:35:59.322]  And you saw what happened today when all of a sudden a vaccine was announced.
[03:35:59.322 --> 03:36:03.804]  The markets went up 1700 points this morning.
[03:36:03.804 --> 03:36:07.886]  Gold last week was flying high.
[03:36:08.666 --> 03:36:12.147]  Back into the mid-1900s range.
[03:36:12.147 --> 03:36:16.028]  Now it's down over 80 bucks.
[03:36:16.028 --> 03:36:19.309]  On a talk of a new vaccine.
[03:36:19.309 --> 03:36:21.870]  Again, is this a coincidence?
[03:36:21.870 --> 03:36:29.112]  That right after Associated Press announces that Biden wins, the Associated Press announced.
[03:36:29.112 --> 03:36:31.093]  Who the hell are the Associated Press?
[03:36:31.093 --> 03:36:33.853]  Associated Prostitutes.
[03:36:33.853 --> 03:36:35.614]  Medial whores that get paid to put out.
[03:36:36.846 --> 03:36:42.730]  And again, among my greatest fears is number one, that Biden is a warmonger.
[03:36:42.730 --> 03:36:48.375]  And as all you all know, I launched Occupy Peace, so I'm opposed to this.
[03:36:48.375 --> 03:37:06.108]  And while I'm totally opposed to what Trump did with the assassination of Soleimani of Iran and what he's done with Venezuela, nothing compared to what the Democrats have done with their wars.
[03:37:06.789 --> 03:37:08.830]  Destroying Libya.
[03:37:08.830 --> 03:37:11.271]  Destroying it.
[03:37:11.271 --> 03:37:12.792]  The richest nation in Africa.
[03:37:12.792 --> 03:37:15.553]  The people had more rights and more benefits than anywhere else.
[03:37:15.553 --> 03:37:19.755]  Even better rights than in many Western civilization countries.
[03:37:19.755 --> 03:37:20.455]  Destroyed.
[03:37:20.455 --> 03:37:22.216]  Syria, destroyed.
[03:37:22.216 --> 03:37:27.118]  Can't understand why you have that migrant and refugee problem over there in Europe.
[03:37:27.118 --> 03:37:29.740]  You Europeans, you don't talk about that.
[03:37:29.740 --> 03:37:32.781]  Brought to you by Biden and the Obama gang.
[03:37:33.795 --> 03:37:52.504]  Yeah, the ones, this is the gang that Obama signed into order, you know, the El Presidente, that they could murder anybody, anyplace, anytime, American, wherever you are, send you off to a foreign country and put you into jail the rest of your life, or torture you until you die.
[03:37:52.504 --> 03:37:56.626]  That's who the Democrats love so much.
[03:37:56.626 --> 03:38:00.308]  The Bidens are, Obama's back in office.
[03:38:00.308 --> 03:38:01.168]  The Obama gang.
[03:38:03.510 --> 03:38:07.292]  Is that guy Pritzker, that woman Pritzker, was the Commerce Secretary?
[03:38:07.292 --> 03:38:11.374]  She was very much behind this election.
[03:38:11.374 --> 03:38:25.201]  And her big brother, really big, big, big brother, over there in Illinois, is he the governor?
[03:38:25.201 --> 03:38:26.721]  And were the Pritzkers?
[03:38:26.721 --> 03:38:28.382]  Ohio Hotel, is that the one?
[03:38:28.382 --> 03:38:29.563]  Is that the family?
[03:38:29.563 --> 03:38:29.763]  Yeah.
[03:38:31.388 --> 03:38:34.529]  Again, it's one big club and you ain't in it.
[03:38:34.529 --> 03:38:36.630]  It's the Money Gang.
[03:38:36.630 --> 03:38:38.331]  It's the Mafia.
[03:38:38.331 --> 03:38:40.372]  No, no.
[03:38:40.372 --> 03:38:43.073]  Not us Italians.
[03:38:43.073 --> 03:38:47.915]  Again, you can make fun of the Italians and call us Mafia.
[03:38:47.915 --> 03:38:51.397]  Yeah, but you can't say that about the blacks.
[03:38:51.397 --> 03:38:53.458]  Can't show me the drunken Irish cop.
[03:38:54.701 --> 03:38:58.944]  You can't show me the Jewish Bankster, but you can make fun of the Italians.
[03:38:58.944 --> 03:39:00.385]  Hey, it's okay.
[03:39:00.385 --> 03:39:02.586]  So let's be equal here.
[03:39:02.586 --> 03:39:05.928]  So looking at what's happened here.
[03:39:05.928 --> 03:39:11.411]  We got Big Pharma right in front of our eyes.
[03:39:11.411 --> 03:39:16.695]  Right in front of our eyes, running the show.
[03:39:16.695 --> 03:39:20.657]  Number two, the Wall Street gang, right in front of our eyes.
[03:39:21.667 --> 03:39:28.172]  Juicing the equity markets up as we speak over a thousand points.
[03:39:28.172 --> 03:39:39.059]  And the lawyers, the lousy lying lawyers, the shocksters.
[03:39:39.059 --> 03:39:50.107]  Yeah, you know when a guy like Jamie Dimon's gang over there, the JPMorgan Chase, when they get felonies and charged with all of these
[03:39:50.856 --> 03:39:53.698]  Crimes.
[03:39:53.698 --> 03:39:55.479]  Nobody goes to jail.
[03:39:55.479 --> 03:39:57.960]  Nobody goes to jail.
[03:39:57.960 --> 03:40:10.888]  And now, these arrogant guys and girls telling us that we gotta get vaccinated here in New York, in a country, in a state near you.
[03:40:10.888 --> 03:40:12.288]  Here we are.
[03:40:12.288 --> 03:40:18.372]  Mary Beth Morrissey, Chair of the New York Bar Association's Health Law
[03:40:19.312 --> 03:40:38.620]  Section Task Force on COVID-19 said in a statement on November 7th, a Saturday when no one was paying attention, quote, the authority of the state to respond to public health crisis is well established in constitutional law.
[03:40:38.620 --> 03:40:40.001]  Shove it!
[03:40:40.001 --> 03:40:41.362]  Shove it!
[03:40:41.362 --> 03:40:44.703]  Don't you tell me what constitutional law is.
[03:40:44.703 --> 03:40:47.804]  This is crap that you're making up.
[03:40:47.804 --> 03:40:48.865]  So shove it!
[03:40:52.811 --> 03:41:04.039]  In balancing the protection of the public health and civil liberties, the public health law recognizes that a person's health can and does affect others.
[03:41:04.039 --> 03:41:09.784]  Hey, Morrissey, how come Biden didn't have a mask on?
[03:41:09.784 --> 03:41:12.426]  And everybody else did.
[03:41:12.426 --> 03:41:18.230]  How come all you slimers get caught without your masks on when you don't want them on?
[03:41:18.230 --> 03:41:20.892]  And now you're telling us we got to get vaccinated?
[03:41:23.897 --> 03:41:28.119]  Here's the next war and the new party.
[03:41:28.119 --> 03:41:31.500]  And this is why you have to support InfoWars.
[03:41:31.500 --> 03:41:33.901]  And this is why you have to support the Trends Journal.
[03:41:33.901 --> 03:41:36.122]  We're fighting for freedom!
[03:41:36.122 --> 03:41:42.004]  And they're stealing it in front of our eyes!
[03:41:42.004 --> 03:41:43.765]  The new parties.
[03:41:43.765 --> 03:41:46.906]  The Republicans are a bunch of jerks!
[03:41:46.906 --> 03:41:48.146]  Look at them!
[03:41:48.146 --> 03:41:49.447]  Look at them!
[03:41:49.447 --> 03:41:50.187]  McConnell.
[03:41:51.061 --> 03:41:52.483]  Lindsey Graham!
[03:41:52.483 --> 03:41:54.004]  These aren't my kind of men!
[03:41:54.004 --> 03:41:58.910]  One after another, we need a new party!
[03:41:58.910 --> 03:42:02.174]  Anti-vax and anti-tax!
[03:42:02.174 --> 03:42:06.078]  Anti-vax and anti-tax!
[03:42:06.078 --> 03:42:08.300]  Don't you tell me what to do!
[03:42:08.300 --> 03:42:10.443]  I want to have a freedom party!
[03:42:11.508 --> 03:42:13.550]  I want a party of freedom!
[03:42:13.550 --> 03:42:17.213]  I don't need anybody telling me what to do!
[03:42:17.213 --> 03:42:20.596]  Nobody is going to force me to get vaccinated!
[03:42:20.596 --> 03:42:24.940]  Nobody, nowhere, no how!
[03:42:24.940 --> 03:42:26.321]  Cuomo's going to try!
[03:42:27.705 --> 03:42:38.312]  New York governor, little Andy Cuomo, an arrogant boy born on third base, would be nobody if daddy wasn't Mario, like his little brother.
[03:42:38.312 --> 03:42:42.995]  Two little pieces of nothing, if daddy wasn't there before them.
[03:42:42.995 --> 03:42:45.617]  Told good morning America.
[03:42:45.617 --> 03:42:46.797]  Good morning America.
[03:42:46.797 --> 03:42:49.339]  There you clown boy.
[03:42:49.339 --> 03:42:52.061]  On Monday morning today,
[03:42:52.822 --> 03:43:01.947]  That while development of an effective coronavirus vaccine was good news, it was bad news that it would arrive while President Donald Trump is in office.
[03:43:01.947 --> 03:43:13.514]  He went on to say that the bad news is that it's about two months before Joe Biden takes over and means this administration is going to be implementing the vaccine plan.
[03:43:13.514 --> 03:43:21.038]  The vaccine plan is very important and it's probably the most ambitious undertaking since COVID-flawed.
[03:43:22.287 --> 03:43:27.674]  And the Trump administration is rolling out the vaccine plan that I believe it's flawed.
[03:43:27.674 --> 03:43:29.416]  I believe it learns nothing from the past.
[03:43:29.416 --> 03:43:32.780]  They're basically going to have the private providers do it.
[03:43:32.780 --> 03:43:39.429]  And that's going to leave out all sorts of communities that were left out the first time the COVID ravaged them.
[03:43:41.607 --> 03:43:47.689]  Hey, moron Cuomo, more people died in New York than anywhere else in the country, not even close.
[03:43:47.689 --> 03:43:49.830]  Everything you did is a failure.
[03:43:49.830 --> 03:43:52.651]  And again, you'd be nobody if Daddy wasn't there.
[03:43:52.651 --> 03:43:58.573]  I'll tell you what, Cuomo, you bring the vaccine over here and you try to vaccinate me.
[03:43:58.573 --> 03:43:59.593]  That's right.
[03:43:59.593 --> 03:44:03.734]  You come over here and try to vaccinate me man to man.
[03:44:03.734 --> 03:44:08.676]  Hey, I'm a lot older than you and you try to do it to me.
[03:44:08.676 --> 03:44:10.857]  You try to do it to me.
[03:44:10.857 --> 03:44:11.037]  Yeah.
[03:44:12.153 --> 03:44:18.160]  Bye-bye Cuomo and bye-bye freedom if we don't fight for it.
[03:44:18.160 --> 03:44:20.082]  Support InfoWars.
[03:44:20.082 --> 03:44:21.783]  Support the Trends Journal.
[03:44:21.783 --> 03:44:22.764]  Fight for freedom.
[03:44:22.764 --> 03:44:24.046]  Our life is on the line.
