[00:56.720 --> 01:02.040]  are beginning in earnest now our in-depth coverage of one of the most
[01:02.040 --> 01:05.600]  important globalist meetings will be most important meeting that we know of
[01:05.600 --> 01:09.720]  whether other meetings going on other events happening inside the global
[01:09.720 --> 01:14.320]  national security crime syndicate absolutely do the globalist more and
[01:14.320 --> 01:18.040]  just put out their world government plans openly at Davos and other semi
[01:18.040 --> 01:23.960]  public forums yes they do do they use frontmen like Bono to go out and
[01:23.960 --> 01:28.320]  collect money to actually carry out eugenics yes but they've tried to keep
[01:28.320 --> 01:33.400]  Bilderberg secrets since 1954 that it was given the impromptu impromptu name
[01:33.400 --> 01:38.320]  then it's you know really been meeting since right at the end of World War two
[01:38.320 --> 01:43.280]  with the top Nazi Prince Bernhardt and others helping found it their goal a
[01:43.280 --> 01:47.280]  European Union by stealth an American Union by stealth a Asian Union by
[01:47.280 --> 01:52.760]  stealth we're now seeing their plans pretty much come to fruition but things
[01:52.760 --> 01:57.200]  are collapsing right as they go into high gear they've gotten much of what they
[01:57.200 --> 02:01.520]  want but they're not doing it in secret people are learning that the
[02:01.520 --> 02:05.240]  politicians are just frontmen and women just puppets and people are waking up
[02:05.240 --> 02:14.040]  big-time tomorrow we will be broadcasting from basically on the scene just 24
[02:14.040 --> 02:18.200]  hours before they start arriving I'll just leave it at that we saw a lot of
[02:18.200 --> 02:22.440]  dirty tricks when I covered Bilderberg in person six years ago in Canada I was
[02:22.440 --> 02:26.400]  detained for 15 hours and screamed that they were gonna deport me or send me to
[02:26.400 --> 02:30.200]  prison they said until the media showed up and that was in all the big papers
[02:30.200 --> 02:33.440]  there in Canada I don't know in five or six big papers and international news
[02:33.440 --> 02:36.760]  that's on record if you mentioned I covered my film in game then four years
[02:36.760 --> 02:41.200]  ago when I covered it here in Virginia at the same conference center and it's
[02:41.200 --> 02:45.120]  that's where it's taking place they've got it booked under the code name palm
[02:45.120 --> 02:49.920]  three conference they're hopping mad that we know that I had two sources now I
[02:49.920 --> 02:58.760]  have three and the information we're learning is nothing short of amazing I'm
[02:58.760 --> 03:06.560]  trying to collate all that while preparing to actually get into the
[03:06.560 --> 03:12.320]  suburb of DC Chantilly so it's all gonna be being broke down here live on the
[03:12.320 --> 03:16.960]  radio at 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern and then we're also gonna have infowars

[03:27.600 --> 03:31.720]  researchers and even a lot of mainstream media the word is politico is gonna be
[03:31.720 --> 03:37.080]  there salon making jokes about it but they have to I mean they the dinosaur
[03:37.080 --> 03:41.000]  media said this stuff didn't exist the dinosaur media is trying to segue
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.440]  through things like politico but they've got to make cheeky jokes about it
[03:45.440 --> 03:49.240]  because okay it's real they're meeting in secret okay it's a hundred and thirty
[03:49.240 --> 03:53.120]  world leaders and they don't want you to see their faces but move along the
[03:53.120 --> 03:56.840]  kooks are the people that told you it existed that were right you know salon

[04:42.240 --> 04:45.640]  gotta say with all those Bilderberg news it's even bigger that the mainstream

[08:24.240 --> 08:30.120]  than 48 hours Bilderberg 2012 kicks off I am coming to you from Roanoke
[08:30.120 --> 08:35.840]  Virginia where a few hours outside at Washington DC and our destination
[08:35.840 --> 08:41.880]  Chantilly right by Dulles International Airport we are going to be covering the
[08:41.880 --> 08:48.480]  kickoff of Bilderberg we have never had so many moles inside the system Jim
[08:48.480 --> 08:54.200]  Tucker has sources that have been proven to be bonafide incredibly accurate we
[08:54.200 --> 08:59.440]  have moles very close to Bilderberg I'll just leave it at that and then moles even
[08:59.440 --> 09:04.440]  closer but not to Bilderberg itself but to this event I'll just I'll just leave
[09:04.440 --> 09:08.960]  it at that in fact there's a lot of fake lists floating around out there some
[09:08.960 --> 09:13.800]  fake press releases floating around out there supposedly put out by Bilderberg
[09:13.800 --> 09:19.280]  that is not the case we've looked into it believe me now find out later I can't
[09:19.280 --> 09:24.840]  see how I know that then we've also got a lot of other information I'll be
[09:24.840 --> 09:29.720]  covering coming up on the show today but we have got the scoop on what's going on
[09:29.720 --> 09:34.680]  and it is important and the globalist as we reported yesterday at info wars.com
[09:34.680 --> 09:40.360]  are very upset that our sources have revealed to us the name of the Palm
[09:40.360 --> 09:45.720]  Tree conference the codename of Bilderberg 2012 and that we found out so
[09:45.720 --> 09:48.640]  early where they were meeting this year they're returning to the scene of the
[09:48.640 --> 09:52.360]  crime in Virginia where they've come the last two presidential elections they're
[09:52.360 --> 09:57.680]  now here for their third time at the Chantilly facility they're at the
[09:57.680 --> 10:04.680]  Marriott Westfields Marriott in the lace as it's known in French Chantilly and
[10:04.680 --> 10:11.720]  they are very upset last time they had secret service marines and plainclothes
[10:11.720 --> 10:18.600]  assigned to State Department diplomatic security they had FBI that's what we know
[10:18.600 --> 10:21.760]  of and obviously there were other intelligence agencies contractors and
[10:21.760 --> 10:27.840]  groups there but that's what we could confirm this time they're hopping mad
[10:27.840 --> 10:32.840]  because they believe there could be as many as 2,000 people coming now we've
[10:32.840 --> 10:41.480]  put a Bilderberg itinerary out and that is tomorrow basically at noon one o'clock
[10:41.480 --> 10:45.880]  you know that general time yes it's gonna be hot in the middle of the day but
[10:45.880 --> 10:49.400]  well actually tomorrow is Wednesday I'm getting ahead of myself I'll be out
[10:49.400 --> 10:53.160]  there some tomorrow off and on I'll just leave it at that but then Thursday the
[10:53.160 --> 10:57.760]  itinerary is high noon I'll be broadcasting out there from the sidewalk
[10:57.760 --> 11:06.800]  roasting right through for a few hours of the show and then I'll probably go
[11:06.800 --> 11:11.800]  back to the hotel write some reports and dispatches to Paul Watson Curtin
[11:11.800 --> 11:17.080]  M.O. and others that are writing Aaron Dykes will probably go file some reports
[11:17.080 --> 11:22.400]  and then we're gonna be back out there from say 6 or 7 at night Thursday right
[11:22.400 --> 11:27.840]  through to dark and then we're gonna do it all again the next day and it's
[11:27.840 --> 11:34.920]  important to mass our numbers at those times from about noon to 2 Thursday
[11:34.920 --> 11:39.080]  that's some of the main arrival time really noon to 3 or so and then at night
[11:39.080 --> 11:43.920]  some arrive as well and then the next day protesting on the Friday you know
[11:43.920 --> 11:48.800]  noon to 2 or so and then coming back in the evening of course there'll be
[11:48.800 --> 11:53.280]  protesters there the whole time as well but these are times to mass so that our
[11:53.280 --> 11:56.400]  real numbers can be seen by the corporatist collaborator new older
[11:56.400 --> 12:03.080]  media who's now being forced to cover this then we will do it all over again
[12:03.080 --> 12:08.120]  Saturday and then Sunday I would be out there from like 8 a.m. until about 1
[12:08.120 --> 12:15.680]  they'll all be gone by 1 and in St. Mort's last year in Switzerland a lot of
[12:15.680 --> 12:20.360]  them helicoptered out and left Saturday evening there were over 600 protesters
[12:20.360 --> 12:27.920]  local media reported bearing torches like something out of a novel where they
[12:27.920 --> 12:32.160]  come to get the villagers come in the evening with the pitchforks and torches
[12:32.160 --> 12:39.200]  to go after Dr. Frankenstein and his his creation that is terrorizing the the
[12:39.200 --> 12:45.280]  German Hills we're not calling for violence in fact that's the opposite of
[12:45.280 --> 12:49.480]  what we want we want to peacefully force the globalist media to cover this and
[12:49.480 --> 12:54.640]  admit puppets come and go Obama Mitt Romney Bill Clinton George Bush they
[12:54.640 --> 12:58.280]  come and go it's fun to hate them but in the final equation they're just front
[12:58.280 --> 13:04.040]  men and the globalist is as big since he said two years ago and again this year
[13:04.040 --> 13:08.240]  and his new book that came out he said the elite face the real prospect of
[13:08.240 --> 13:12.440]  being defeated that is the crony centralized monopoly men because for the
[13:12.440 --> 13:17.200]  first time in history period the world is politically awake and staring at the
[13:17.200 --> 13:25.240]  real controllers the power behind the throne not the puppet front men so big
[13:25.240 --> 13:29.200]  things are happening now I'm gonna get to Bilderberg I've got a lot of points
[13:29.200 --> 13:34.640]  here I want to go over in the second hour and get into a USA Today article
[13:34.640 --> 13:42.920]  that is out today gives from government boost Bain and other buyout firms and
[13:42.920 --> 13:48.240]  it's got the Mr. Mitt Romney there now Bain has given double the money to
[13:48.240 --> 13:55.160]  Obama in this election cycle they've given to Romney but the point is the
[13:55.160 --> 14:01.160]  this this is so obvious and this is worse than Bush and Kerry being cousins
[14:01.160 --> 14:06.840]  going to the same fraternity that only has 10 members a year or is it 15 I
[14:06.840 --> 14:12.320]  forget I think it's 10 members yeah 10 people tapped a year I mean only a few
[14:12.320 --> 14:19.120]  hundred living if even that and their policies are almost identical the
[14:19.120 --> 14:25.120]  rhetoric's different and again the if this current Mitt Romney was a was a real
[14:25.120 --> 14:29.080]  person I would like him better than Obama says he's pro-gun says he's
[14:29.080 --> 14:34.120]  anti-globalist says he's against carbon taxes says he's against abortion okay
[14:34.120 --> 14:39.120]  if I knew that's what you were really for I could overlook a lot of the hawkish
[14:39.120 --> 14:43.320]  stuff which is bad enough oh we're at the strongest military you mean for the
[14:43.320 --> 14:48.560]  globalist so we get the blame and pay the bill so opium can be produced in
[14:48.560 --> 14:52.000]  Afghanistan 500 billion a year and all the rest of it the point is is that he
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.520]  would be better than Obama if he actually delivered on anything he said he
[14:57.520 --> 15:01.840]  would but that's not gonna happen this is the guy that wrote the model that
[15:01.840 --> 15:06.520]  became Obamacare I mean I'm sorry but the public is finally starting to really
[15:06.520 --> 15:10.000]  get it they're going well wait Bain capital funds them both all these big
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.120]  Democrats and in New Jersey and New York and Chicago are saying don't go after
[15:14.120 --> 15:20.240]  Bain Democrats don't go after Romney on Bain because it's the same group of
[15:20.240 --> 15:26.720]  scammers that go in and take over pension funds that have already been looted and
[15:26.720 --> 15:32.720]  then poses saviors and then get banker bailouts it's amazing we shot a bunch of
[15:32.720 --> 15:35.680]  reports on that that are up in infowars.com right now so that's all
[15:35.680 --> 15:39.120]  coming up but but here's what we're gonna cover first when we come back from
[15:39.120 --> 15:46.440]  break tuna now I remember it's been I don't know 14 15 months since Fukushima
[15:46.440 --> 15:52.040]  time just flies I remember I guess it was a six months after so we're talking
[15:52.040 --> 15:58.000]  we're talking eight months nine months ago it was in alternative media and it
[15:58.000 --> 16:07.720]  was in infowars.com naturalnews.com being reported on that they were doing
[16:07.720 --> 16:12.160]  a radiation test in as far east as places like Connecticut and Maine and
[16:12.160 --> 16:20.560]  Vermont and finding 15 25 30 times the the quote safe levels of cesium and
[16:20.560 --> 16:25.240]  strontium and other things in the milk that's where bio accumulates because the
[16:25.240 --> 16:28.960]  cows are eating the grass so bio accumulates just like a bio accumulates
[16:28.960 --> 16:33.800]  in big fish that eat smaller fish right through the food chain like blue
[16:33.800 --> 16:39.640]  fantuna yellow fantuna and things like that and we we saw the University of
[16:39.640 --> 16:43.160]  Berkeley did their scientific tests the other chemistry department has an
[16:43.160 --> 16:47.780]  official Department of Energy Radiations monitoring the water the tap water in
[16:47.780 --> 16:52.840]  Berkeley had many times the level of safe radiation one test was 12 one was
[16:52.840 --> 16:58.360]  20 something look this up and this was coming in all over the country so I said
[16:58.360 --> 17:01.280]  alternative media alternative media nationally and internationally was
[17:01.280 --> 17:04.680]  covering it was in local papers and it was in local press releases by
[17:04.680 --> 17:09.240]  universities and and things the government said don't worry the EPA is
[17:09.240 --> 17:12.560]  going to raise the level and so is the FDA of what they say is safe and food
[17:12.560 --> 17:16.440]  and water so both agencies we made a big deal out of this because it's a big deal
[17:16.440 --> 17:20.440]  but I got children that live here in the northern hemisphere we have doubled the
[17:20.440 --> 17:23.280]  radiation just from all the nuclear testing by the Russians the Chinese in
[17:23.280 --> 17:30.240]  the US in the northern hemisphere then we did pre 1940s look that up it was
[17:30.240 --> 17:35.040]  over double now it's close to triple just since Fukushima and the trade winds
[17:35.040 --> 17:41.880]  and the jet stream all blow over here and so eight months ago that started to
[17:41.880 --> 17:45.640]  break we were fair monitors of course the establishment media said but just as
[17:45.640 --> 17:48.920]  we had scientists on who'd actually gone to Japan we're testing it and also gone
[17:48.920 --> 17:54.640]  to the West Coast again those winds both the trade winds near the ground and the
[17:54.640 --> 18:00.800]  jet stream up above goes right over in fact the it dumps in a pan and then the
[18:00.800 --> 18:06.200]  next place it comes down is between New Mexico and Louisiana New Mexico Texas
[18:06.200 --> 18:11.600]  Louisiana is where the that particular coil of the jet stream comes right in I
[18:11.600 --> 18:15.760]  mean it's dumping some on the West Coast and Nevada Arizona but I mean it's
[18:15.760 --> 18:20.680]  really lavishing me where I live just lavishing us with hot particles
[18:20.680 --> 18:24.680]  plutonium that gets attached to small particulate even though it's a heavy
[18:24.680 --> 18:29.200]  isotope it's going up there you get one of those in your lung by by Blackbird
[18:29.200 --> 18:33.600]  you know you're gonna die in 20 years you die early but hey they're gonna make
[18:33.600 --> 18:38.800]  money off of it so what's the big deal nine out of ten reactors are leaking so
[18:38.800 --> 18:42.160]  then about six months ago the reports come in eight months ago nine months
[18:42.160 --> 18:47.360]  ago we first are getting reports of radiation you're really being heavy the
[18:47.360 --> 18:52.160]  media says it's fine everything's great the dinosaur delusional decepticon
[18:52.160 --> 18:55.360]  media just thinks if they say it's fine it's fine then about six months ago the
[18:55.360 --> 18:59.200]  airline pilot start complaining their hair's falling out that fly out of
[18:59.200 --> 19:05.880]  flew out of Alaska because guess where the winds there's a particular stream of
[19:05.880 --> 19:09.040]  winds there are more trade winds down low guess where they hit first if you look
[19:09.040 --> 19:12.960]  at the map there's Japan it's really pretty close to Alaska sticking up the
[19:12.960 --> 19:22.400]  first water in the in the streams in the tides in the what's the proper term you
[19:22.400 --> 19:27.360]  know in the swirling motion of the ocean in the direction that the oceans goes
[19:27.360 --> 19:30.400]  it'll pop my head in a minute you know the standard term everybody knows it out
[19:30.400 --> 19:34.680]  there listening well no I know what a whirlpool is no I mean what's it called
[19:34.680 --> 19:42.840]  the just like the winds go go from east to west no no not a vortex it's all
[19:42.840 --> 19:46.760]  right I'll come we come back I'll have it the point is it's just like there's
[19:46.760 --> 19:49.440]  there's patterns and when there's patterns and water you know it's all
[19:49.440 --> 19:55.000]  gone up to Alaska and the seals are dying the people's hair is falling out
[19:55.000 --> 19:58.080]  and the government just says everything's fine we say radiation's good for
[19:58.080 --> 20:01.360]  you we'll be right back with that because the tuna are now heading to California
[20:01.360 --> 20:04.520]  and Jebedy products work for many others and so I bought a bunch of them
[20:04.520 --> 20:08.160]  started using them had a little bit of results but I wasn't following the
[20:08.160 --> 20:13.440]  regimen every day but Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds
[20:13.440 --> 20:18.000]  when I saw those results I said I better follow my own advice I started taking
[20:18.000 --> 20:23.480]  the in Jebedy products and it's been incredible 37 pounds in two months our
[20:23.480 --> 20:28.120]  bodies are amazing and God gave us an incredible gift but if our body doesn't

[24:27.640 --> 24:35.320]  they've come to destroy us
[24:35.320 --> 24:42.400]  say what you want about mr. Morrison that he was an amazing poet and he knew it or
[24:42.400 --> 24:49.240]  to believe he died at 28 isn't it yep drugs killed putting that heroin then
[24:49.240 --> 24:53.040]  our troops are forced to grow in Afghanistan and ship into the US but
[24:53.040 --> 24:58.960]  oh it's not patriotic to mention that just stick a Chinese made flag from
[24:58.960 --> 25:04.160]  China on your car and say you're patriotic and I'm not knocking people
[25:04.160 --> 25:07.600]  that do that but I mean come on let's defend the actual Bill of Rights and
[25:07.600 --> 25:14.040]  Constitution that that flag symbolizes that's why we revere it it represents
[25:14.040 --> 25:20.240]  the 13 colonies represents the deep blue sky it represents liberty and freedom
[25:20.240 --> 25:24.760]  and we have now become the opposite of that in so many respects we still have
[25:24.760 --> 25:28.960]  all this freedom and liberty in our past there but running parallels the
[25:28.960 --> 25:33.520]  globalist empire built on American ingenuity and energy and I'm tired of it
[25:33.520 --> 25:38.000]  I want to put a shout out before I get back into the news to just all of the
[25:38.000 --> 25:48.640]  incredible people that I talk to or that I have contact with in the media you
[25:48.640 --> 25:52.960]  name it that listen to this show I am not worthy as they say in Wayne's word
[25:52.960 --> 25:58.400]  Wayne's world we're not worthy we're not worthy I mean so many people get a
[25:58.400 --> 26:03.040]  little bit of media power and it goes to their heads and they just get crazy and
[26:03.040 --> 26:08.480]  arrogant with me it is the opposite I understand this responsibility but I
[26:08.480 --> 26:13.280]  want to give a little shout out to that particular person there in Florida in
[26:13.280 --> 26:17.840]  their little jungle compound listening to the show right now those were some
[26:17.840 --> 26:24.240]  nice words that that I was able to read and thank you for all you do
[26:24.240 --> 26:29.560]  certainly back at you what you said the other thing you said absolutely back at
[26:29.560 --> 26:36.480]  you back at you but but but think about this the listeners the activists that
[26:36.480 --> 26:41.800]  that tune into the M2M4 Wars all of us we are the people that are awake we're
[26:41.800 --> 26:46.000]  the people that understand what's going on we're the people that are informed
[26:46.000 --> 26:51.760]  and I've come to the full conclusion the elite are insane they're in control to a
[26:51.760 --> 26:55.800]  great extent they're trying to get full control of the the world out of their
[26:55.800 --> 26:59.960]  fear and out of their will to power but who they need to get control of is
[26:59.960 --> 27:06.240]  themselves the globalist want to control our every move and dumb us down so
[27:06.240 --> 27:10.840]  we're so we're more manageable but it just hits me more and more in epiphany
[27:10.840 --> 27:18.880]  every five minutes that the elite are out of control and insane so it's true
[27:18.880 --> 27:23.400]  that they're not in control and that they're a bunch of crazies and that
[27:23.400 --> 27:30.760]  there's a lot of you know bureaucratic screw-ups but they've got the money the
[27:30.760 --> 27:34.840]  power the endless social engineering systems and they've just got their own
[27:34.840 --> 27:38.280]  inertia like a giant cruise ship you've already turned the engine off but it's
[27:38.280 --> 27:43.320]  gonna keep gliding a while running over us or or a big edifice collapsing on us
[27:43.320 --> 27:49.800]  okay it's collapsing but we're under it so they are organizing things but but
[27:49.800 --> 27:54.680]  it's easy for them to organize things all they do is screw things up so it's
[27:54.680 --> 28:02.520]  it's a it's a mix of things but to realize that we're it we're it in the
[28:02.520 --> 28:07.000]  new media in the alternative media the true diversity of ideas the discussions
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.040]  that system that's growing through the internet the the old guard coming in
[28:11.040 --> 28:16.600]  trying to curtail that and shut it down that's not gonna work we're going into
[28:16.600 --> 28:21.880]  incredible times anybody that says they're bored or oh life is just boring
[28:21.880 --> 28:28.280]  and what are they thinking the the the the universe of ideas and information
[28:28.280 --> 28:32.200]  and developments and the crazy stuff going on and the beautiful things
[28:32.200 --> 28:36.200]  happening and the ugly things happening and the amazing things happening and
[28:36.200 --> 28:41.640]  the scientific discoveries and now they're saying the zombie man in South
[28:41.640 --> 28:45.240]  Beach on the new South Beach diet sorry to say that but that's what the joke's
[28:45.240 --> 28:50.280]  going around that's terrible I didn't I didn't make it up was on bath salts now
[28:50.280 --> 28:53.680]  and had a chemical imbalance with another naked guy and all I said is the
[28:53.680 --> 28:57.280]  footage doesn't show what they say it does we should question it and they're
[28:57.280 --> 29:01.320]  like don't question the system just believe whatever they say like the cop
[29:01.320 --> 29:04.800]  shooting the guy in the back at the train station when he's on the ground in
[29:04.800 --> 29:07.480]  handcuffs and then later saying he wasn't in handcuffs and it attacked him
[29:07.480 --> 29:11.080]  they confiscate all the citizens cameras but one person's hiding in a train
[29:11.080 --> 29:14.400]  before it pulls out and gets it people are like don't say the cop really shot
[29:14.400 --> 29:18.760]  him on purpose you're a anti cop liar know when I've been lied to millions of
[29:18.760 --> 29:24.560]  times I mean literally there's thousands of governments in this country tens of
[29:24.560 --> 29:27.640]  thousands worldwide they're all constantly lying that's millions of lies I
[29:27.640 --> 29:31.640]  stop believing liars even when they're telling the truth because you don't know
[29:31.640 --> 29:35.240]  they're telling the truth and that's why societies fall is because the trust is
[29:35.240 --> 29:38.600]  lost and the system thinks they're gonna use a police state by the way we found

[33:52.480 --> 33:57.840]  rant I won't open the phones up for any subjects you want to discuss after I get
[33:57.840 --> 34:02.560]  into some of this news here but the toll-free number to join us on this
[34:02.560 --> 34:19.800]  Tuesday edition is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 again 800-259-9231 is the
[34:19.800 --> 34:24.480]  toll-free number to join us and I I'm here in a hotel room in Roanoke, Virginia
[34:24.480 --> 34:31.400]  and my my producer I on the road producer Richard Reeves I told him you've
[34:31.400 --> 34:35.880]  got to go take a nap you keep staying up till 2 3 in the morning getting
[34:35.880 --> 34:39.240]  everything ready we didn't get until about 2 o'clock last night you got to go
[34:39.240 --> 34:42.920]  take a nap because I can operate without sleep you can't drive the big
[34:42.920 --> 34:49.800]  giant 45-foot jalopy bus I love that bus like 12 years old but it's awesome
[34:49.800 --> 34:54.120]  that's as big as they get to I said you got to get some sleep here pal I know
[34:54.120 --> 34:57.560]  he's listening right now on the bus and I'm telling you you'd never do what I
[34:57.560 --> 35:02.280]  tell you to do okay you get some rest there pal or I'll drive I know I drive
[35:02.280 --> 35:06.000]  sometimes but he's formerly professional driver it's better than when I'm
[35:06.000 --> 35:09.160]  driving that thing because when we get into a highway situation there's an 18
[35:09.160 --> 35:13.000]  wheeler right there and they're and they're doing construction and they've
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.680]  got those highway
[35:16.240 --> 35:20.440]  so let me tell you that is that is pretty many it's not like landing on
[35:20.440 --> 35:23.520]  aircraft carrier at night or anything not that humans will be doing that sense
[35:23.520 --> 35:27.020]  long to be drones as we're taking out of the equation that's coming up later
[35:27.020 --> 35:33.200]  some technology does the third industrial revolution 14 page special
[35:33.200 --> 35:38.120]  report out of the economists the same globalist publication it tells us we're
[35:38.120 --> 35:42.840]  lucky to have oligarch bankers that created the derivatives fraud taking over
[35:42.840 --> 35:47.480]  Europe they're called technocrats now but this is all about nanotech and how
[35:47.480 --> 35:53.200]  it's starting with the 3d printers so we're gonna be breaking that down that
[35:53.200 --> 35:57.840]  was a report a few months ago a scientific report came out in fours
[35:57.840 --> 36:01.920]  dot com reported on it so the natural news that most people are now when
[36:01.920 --> 36:05.920]  they're doing autopsies they're finding nanotech in the brain it's in a lot of
[36:05.920 --> 36:10.120]  processed foods manufacturing little machines and it's going right through the
[36:10.120 --> 36:14.000]  blood-brain barrier and is hurting you even worse than aluminum cans or even
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.560]  worse than fluoride and see that's why the globalists don't think it matters
[36:17.560 --> 36:22.520]  soon I mean they just they have a death lust or something oh radiation's good
[36:22.520 --> 36:26.600]  oh 9 out 10 reactors are leaking one way or the other we're not gonna even fix
[36:26.600 --> 36:30.200]  the old ones having their walls eaten by radiation we're gonna keep the old 40
[36:30.200 --> 36:33.920]  year design oh we're gonna build more of the old design yeah meltdowns are good
[36:33.920 --> 36:40.520]  now remember when mom be out the big globalist came out in the Guardian and
[36:40.520 --> 36:44.200]  said I like radiation now I think Fukushima makes me like it that was the
[36:44.200 --> 36:49.200]  headline well I want more and they all giggled and said population bye bye
[36:49.200 --> 36:55.440]  bye bye fertility bye bye it's like that guy on the McLaughlin report bye bye
[36:55.440 --> 36:58.800]  people think I interrupt on the show that guy's the king of interrupted what
[36:58.800 --> 37:02.160]  do you think about this well I think that's good let's go the next person by
[37:02.160 --> 37:06.720]  the way it's a meme by trolls to say I interrupt what I do is I interject in a
[37:06.720 --> 37:11.280]  ham-fisted way I'm not good at it because I get I get so excited about it
[37:11.280 --> 37:14.320]  it's not that I even want to dominate conversation I just get excited about the
[37:14.320 --> 37:17.400]  topics that's why the show is popular the information is important but I'm also
[37:17.400 --> 37:23.040]  excited I've analyzed that but you watch Fox News or CNN they're interrupting on
[37:23.040 --> 37:26.800]  those shows about every 30 seconds my guest I've timed it on average talk
[37:26.800 --> 37:32.200]  about three minutes but but again you can't argue with success point is I'm
[37:32.200 --> 37:34.960]  gonna interrupt even more if I want to especially when somebody gets off the
[37:34.960 --> 37:38.720]  reservation it gets off the topic but getting back to nanotech we warned you
[37:38.720 --> 37:44.560]  about nanotech polluting things just all different sorts of it in the packaging
[37:44.560 --> 37:49.080]  of your food in the TV dinners in products you're using it's going through
[37:49.080 --> 37:53.600]  your skin it's going into everything all the neurological disorders cancer you
[37:53.600 --> 37:58.000]  know the drill it's all going what straight up on the graph it's not going
[37:58.000 --> 38:03.440]  like that like it's been for 56 years now it's going straight up like a Saturn
[38:03.440 --> 38:09.440]  rocket like Dragon X the new corporate private technology see they use our tax
[38:09.440 --> 38:13.840]  money to build the corporate a system 90% of spaceflight roughly has been
[38:13.840 --> 38:16.780]  secret anyway since the beginning now they just get rid of the old tanker
[38:16.780 --> 38:20.080]  toy and say you don't worry about manned spaceflight anymore it's all
[38:20.080 --> 38:24.120]  gonna be drones and it's national security so you don't worry I just sit
[38:24.120 --> 38:29.080]  down pay your taxes and shut up carbon-based life form shut up slave
[38:29.080 --> 38:33.280]  shut up human resource see I said in plain view shut up give us your money
[38:33.280 --> 38:39.280]  and energy we're the social engineers you watch American Idol well this broadcast
[38:39.280 --> 38:42.720]  is all about you know what I want to be in control of my destiny I want to have
[38:42.720 --> 38:46.400]  a say I know what you're doing technologically and you elites are
[38:46.400 --> 38:49.240]  digging your own grave oh we're not coming to get you you're destroying
[38:49.240 --> 38:53.000]  yourselves you're breathing the radiation you're eating the nano tech
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.640]  your kids I've looked it up or getting hurt by this stuff you guys all just
[38:56.640 --> 39:00.040]  think if you have bravada and say you're in control and this advanced
[39:00.040 --> 39:04.200]  singularities coming that will clean it all up like Kurzweil and others say uh-uh
[39:04.200 --> 39:08.960]  you're probably gonna end up destroying us with the Hadron black hole creator of
[39:08.960 --> 39:12.520]  the Strangelet creator with all your weapons systems with all the crap you're
[39:12.520 --> 39:15.400]  doing because you're all competing with each other and acting like you're
[39:15.400 --> 39:18.400]  tough and smart I've been around a lot of these elitists now billionaires you
[39:18.400 --> 39:21.760]  name it and let me tell you something they came along at the right place of
[39:21.760 --> 39:26.480]  the right time to get in the right group to create a stock offering or a rip
[39:26.480 --> 39:32.280]  off or a scam or a government contract and they're not even that smart you
[39:32.280 --> 39:35.680]  think it's smart you know how to set up systems to dump people down and screw
[39:35.680 --> 39:39.720]  them over no that's not smart because if you were really smart you'd know that
[39:39.720 --> 39:43.080]  when you knock down all the laws you're not protected either and what comes
[39:43.080 --> 39:49.520]  around does go around and and you cannot get out of what you've done the new
[39:49.520 --> 39:52.840]  world order always wants to control everything but you can't control
[39:52.840 --> 39:57.080]  yourselves you got all this godlike technology but you're still a man you're
[39:57.080 --> 40:02.080]  still a woman and a lot of you are already figuring this out I'm seeing a
[40:02.080 --> 40:05.640]  shift in the power structure at a lot of levels where they're going whoa whoa
[40:05.640 --> 40:10.520]  yeah this it doesn't matter though more competitive ones who are delusional
[40:10.520 --> 40:14.120]  and have delusions of grandeur they're seizing all these levers and going no
[40:14.120 --> 40:21.360]  I will use the power mine I will be the leader I will control it this is what
[40:21.360 --> 40:27.920]  we're seeing happen and I'm telling you we're headed for destruction I just told
[40:27.920 --> 40:31.480]  you about nanotech years from now you're gonna hear about the nanotech and
[40:31.480 --> 40:36.120]  they're gonna go oh it's Alzheimer's oh it's mad cow oh it's a prion all this
[40:36.120 --> 40:40.920]  bull here CBS Christian science monitor you name it and we told you about the
[40:40.920 --> 40:44.960]  six months ago we first told you about seals eight months ago the seals because
[40:44.960 --> 40:51.720]  again the currents and the Coriolis effect of the jet stream and the other
[40:51.720 --> 40:56.680]  trade ones coming over the first place it hits is much closer distance and
[40:56.680 --> 40:59.920]  they're much faster currency we had experts on we looked at the maps you
[40:59.920 --> 41:04.800]  will pull these up they've got wave monitors bullies everything within two
[41:04.800 --> 41:08.520]  months of Fukushima all that stuff that went out to see the explosions the
[41:08.520 --> 41:12.120]  hundreds of thousands is 400 something thousand rods shot out into the water in
[41:12.120 --> 41:16.080]  other areas shot up to two miles New York Times reported two months after we
[41:16.080 --> 41:20.760]  did just pointing out we know what we're talking about all of that is out there
[41:20.760 --> 41:23.560]  people say well the rods sink to the bottom well the plutonium reactor that
[41:23.560 --> 41:28.800]  melted down partially well you know that's a heavy isotope it gets on spider
[41:28.800 --> 41:34.000]  webs it gets on feathers it gets on insects you know you can go up an
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.640]  airplane and fly around at 20,000 feet 30,000 feet 40,000 feet in the jet
[41:37.640 --> 41:41.840]  stream and they do this with big scoops on the front of planes and jets and they
[41:41.840 --> 41:50.160]  scoop up sometimes hundred year old 200 year old spiders roaches ladybugs there's
[41:50.160 --> 41:54.440]  pieces of trash and garbage all floating around that stuff gets shot up in the
[41:54.440 --> 41:58.120]  atmosphere you ever seen a plastic bag floating around you watch it go up
[41:58.120 --> 42:04.800]  thousands of feet disappear that stuff is all basted in in scores of radioactive
[42:04.800 --> 42:10.920]  isotopes and coming over here and enough of it hit the grasslands that now for
[42:10.920 --> 42:13.880]  more than eight months they've been reporting massive increases in
[42:13.880 --> 42:16.920]  radiation in the milk across the country including the east coast not just
[42:16.920 --> 42:22.120]  west coast in northern Mexico in Canada and Alaska but Alaska got hit first so
[42:22.120 --> 42:26.120]  the seals this is in the local news there it's in the Anchorage Daily papers
[42:26.120 --> 42:30.960]  it's in there the seals are dying their hairs falling out their teeth are
[42:30.960 --> 42:35.000]  falling out they're miscarrying and the people living there are starting to
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.960]  report this and the fishermen are reporting the fish are deformed and the
[42:39.960 --> 42:45.400]  airline pilots that fly back and forth in this stuff all day to Japan G what do
[42:45.400 --> 42:48.400]  you think they've been flying through it's still melting down still smoking
[42:48.400 --> 42:52.760]  over there all that sea debris started at the California coast that was all
[42:52.760 --> 42:58.000]  basted in it and the answer is hey radiation is good for you shut up
[42:58.000 --> 43:01.320]  conspiracy theory but I'm like but I was proven right again I mean I wasn't I had
[43:01.320 --> 43:05.800]  scientists from Japan the US at the EU one of their top advisors Dr. Busby on
[43:05.800 --> 43:11.200]  about this they measured the isotopes that means full meltdown we have all
[43:11.200 --> 43:15.640]  the signatures we know what happened we should warn people to you have local
[43:15.640 --> 43:19.560]  testing every week this would be a role for God or for corporate groups that
[43:19.560 --> 43:22.760]  would want to certify it and the certification cost money to the test
[43:22.760 --> 43:27.480]  that stuff would all sell the free market would pay for itself my wife was
[43:27.480 --> 43:35.560]  in Europe in 1986 and Central Europe Western Europe Northern Europe Russia
[43:35.560 --> 43:39.920]  Ukraine Chernobyl and she remembers where she says she was in Italy at the
[43:39.920 --> 43:43.320]  time her dad was a diplomat she was there for one time she was 7 to 20 she
[43:43.320 --> 43:48.840]  also went to college over there and she remembers for six months at least
[43:48.840 --> 43:54.760]  everything was from the US or was from Japan or was from other areas everything
[43:54.760 --> 43:58.680]  was no more lettuce no more fresh stuff it was all frozen they had to get
[43:58.680 --> 44:05.760]  powdered milk from the United States for six months because peas vegetables
[44:05.760 --> 44:10.920]  things that grow on the surface when stuff's raining down on it bio-accumulating
[44:10.920 --> 44:15.440]  and a lot of the cows had to be slaughtered had to be gotten rid of got
[44:15.440 --> 44:20.000]  fed as animal feed dog food and things she vaguely remembers that you can look
[44:20.000 --> 44:25.000]  it up happened in 86 for at least six months no one was allowed to eat that
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.680]  stuff especially the children we get hit by something many times bigger just like
[44:29.680 --> 44:37.800]  hey we just rate look up FDA EPA first was EPA then FDA followed suit raise
[44:37.800 --> 44:42.640]  levels of what they say is safe radiation raise minimum level of safe
[44:42.640 --> 44:46.760]  radiation and you'll just see big long list of all these isotopes page after
[44:46.760 --> 44:50.760]  page more than 50 of them oh this is 25 times safer now this is a hundred times
[44:50.760 --> 44:56.880]  this is 1000 times summer 1000 times they say and I know I've harped on this and
[44:56.880 --> 45:00.160]  harped on this and I guess I use a cell phone even though I know it's giving me
[45:00.160 --> 45:04.240]  brain cancer they know with mammals the globalists have said this once you get
[45:04.240 --> 45:08.640]  used to doing something whether it's smoking or whatever it is or dangerous
[45:08.640 --> 45:12.760]  sexual practices whatever it is you get accustomed and you just think it's safe
[45:12.760 --> 45:15.280]  we're confident we think we're bulletproof we're aggressive smart
[45:15.280 --> 45:19.000]  creatures but we use cell phones I told my wife at the time I said they're not
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.160]  gonna say this is a big deal when I made me to send you guys to the southern
[45:22.160 --> 45:26.000]  hemisphere but I love fighting the New World Order I love fighting the
[45:26.000 --> 45:29.720]  globalist I love my children being around and I've got this huge operation a
[45:29.720 --> 45:34.040]  lot of its ego I guess I should be in the southern hemisphere right now my
[45:34.040 --> 45:37.560]  children are being radiated and they they may get hot particles and you know
[45:37.560 --> 45:43.880]  they'll be 25 30 years old and I will sit there and know that you know we even
[45:43.880 --> 45:48.920]  make it that far that they got a hot particle and it's my fault or that I
[45:48.920 --> 45:52.720]  didn't keep away from GMO enough I mean I'm scum that's why I don't want to hear
[45:52.720 --> 45:56.480]  you calling and tell me how great I am you guys can just text message me now
[45:56.480 --> 46:01.000]  to think about it the callers to my phone I can hear it buzzing over there
[46:01.000 --> 46:06.320]  so just send me those I'll have those coming up so here it is out of the
[46:06.320 --> 46:09.480]  Christian Science Monitor it's everywhere else is typing radioactive tuna
[46:09.480 --> 46:15.680]  radioactive tuna travels from Japan to US faster than wild faster than wind and
[46:15.680 --> 46:22.400]  it just goes on there but again it took this stuff roughly three times longer
[46:22.400 --> 46:27.120]  go look at the buoy numbers you can just type Pacific buoy current maps it'll
[46:27.120 --> 46:30.880]  tell you how tall the waves are right now down to a square mile it will tell
[46:30.880 --> 46:36.560]  you you know these are amazing you know government corporate buoy systems and
[46:36.560 --> 46:42.120]  satellite systems they will tell you how fast the water in that currents moving
[46:42.120 --> 46:46.400]  and now swirls that whirlpool it even has a name of particular whirlpool driven
[46:46.400 --> 46:52.040]  by the winds goes right up right across Fukushima right up into Alaska so it's
[46:52.040 --> 46:57.600]  just getting the main serving you like that enjoy that a little bit and then
[46:57.600 --> 47:01.960]  there's all this other currents just now starting to get to us and you know what
[47:01.960 --> 47:07.000]  parents are taking their kids in in Hawaii right now who also got hit by
[47:07.000 --> 47:09.680]  some of the radiation because some of that stuff comes back now feeding them
[47:09.680 --> 47:15.960]  stuff they're going in in San Diego they're going in in LA but that's us
[47:15.960 --> 47:19.760]  flown over the country in fact you know I eat fish sometimes when I go out to eat
[47:19.760 --> 47:24.960]  and my wife will say where is this fish from is this Pacific and they'll go
[47:24.960 --> 47:29.360]  no it's Atlantic or they'll get mad at her for asking and then they'll say it's
[47:29.360 --> 47:33.600]  farm raised like most fishes we had a guy do that almost wanted to leave the
[47:33.600 --> 47:37.160]  restaurant a few weeks ago I took her out we got a babysitter my parents took
[47:37.160 --> 47:41.200]  her to a decent restaurant I said yeah let's be healthy let's get fish and
[47:41.200 --> 47:45.320]  we're like where does this fish come from it's farm raised you were here three
[47:45.320 --> 47:48.560]  months ago and asked that question and the guy remembered her and my wife kind
[47:48.560 --> 47:51.920]  of wrote him a note at the end is it a sand something it's like okay we're
[47:51.920 --> 47:56.040]  sorry that we wanted to ask you know can we have an Atlantic fish it's farm
[47:56.040 --> 48:01.840]  raised and we said it politely see see it's bad to not want to be poisoned it's
[48:01.840 --> 48:04.600]  bad to be worried about real environmental issues you're just supposed
[48:04.600 --> 48:08.360]  to think Al Gore's your savior and Bono and cut off the third world's energy
[48:08.360 --> 48:11.960]  supplies and you know take a bunch of mercury shots and lower your standard of
[48:11.960 --> 48:15.640]  living for the globalist so they can control you but don't worry about GMO
[48:15.640 --> 48:19.640]  radiation all of us and you read the article they just say everything's
[48:19.640 --> 48:24.120]  wonderful low levels of radiation from the tsunami damaged Fukushima power
[48:24.120 --> 48:28.360]  plant have turned up in bluefin tuna on California coast that's because universities
[48:28.360 --> 48:31.440]  are testing it but they're like the same story it's in your milk it's in your
[48:31.440 --> 48:36.560]  lettuce and and and spinach but listen and carrots but listen it's low and you
[48:36.560 --> 48:39.880]  know why they can say low because they now say it's low to have a couple hundred
[48:39.880 --> 48:44.880]  times low levels of nuclear radiation from the tsunami damage Fukushima power
[48:44.880 --> 48:49.280]  plant have turned up in bluefin tuna on California coast suggesting that these
[48:49.280 --> 48:52.560]  fish-carried radioactive compounds across the Pacific Ocean faster than
[48:52.560 --> 48:59.960]  winter water can bowl wrong again Debra Zappa or a ninco this is actually a
[48:59.960 --> 49:04.280]  Reuters article at Christian Science Monitor if you knew three months ago a
[49:04.280 --> 49:08.080]  couple months ago the current started getting the junk in everything from
[49:08.080 --> 49:12.920]  Fukushima and the Shinami sort of hit in California in the Baja south of there
[49:12.920 --> 49:18.320]  you'd know that within three months you know it took it took eight nine months
[49:18.320 --> 49:21.320]  forward to fully get over here but within three months it was hitting Alaska
[49:21.320 --> 49:25.560]  you'd know about the reports so it's just every line is disinfo mainly through
[49:25.560 --> 49:31.640]  ignorance it's like planet idiocracy Mike judges right and by the way Mike shows
[49:31.640 --> 49:34.760]  awesome I'm glad you're a listener I'm gonna start pestering until it comes on
[49:34.760 --> 49:39.840]  the show continuing here low levels of nuclear radiation oh it's low as they
[49:39.840 --> 49:44.160]  say it is you know used to 20 shots of Jack Daniels was a lot but we've we now
[49:44.160 --> 49:48.600]  called it low so it is low used to being shot was seriously wounded but now we
[49:48.600 --> 49:53.400]  just say it's a flesh wound it's merely a flesh wound low levels of nuclear
[49:53.400 --> 49:56.640]  radiation from the tsunami damaged Fukushima power plant have turned up
[49:56.640 --> 50:00.840]  in bluefin tuna off the California coast suggesting that these fish carried
[50:00.840 --> 50:05.640]  radioactive compounds across Pacific Ocean faster than winter water the jet
[50:05.640 --> 50:10.720]  stream gets here in a couple days it can go 200 miles an hour sometimes that's
[50:10.720 --> 50:15.920]  why you've got it on your tail you can get places a lot earlier wow the wind
[50:15.920 --> 50:22.560]  travels a lot faster than the tuna Pally wellie continuing and and the water
[50:22.560 --> 50:27.040]  can go faster than the tuna overall yeah I say tuna can swim like 60 miles an
[50:27.040 --> 50:31.120]  hour but they don't do that continually small amounts of cesium 137 and
[50:31.120 --> 50:36.600]  cesium 134 were detected in the 15 tuna cottoner San Diego in August of 11
[50:36.600 --> 50:40.480]  they're now just telling us about this and it just goes over all that now we

[54:12.400 --> 54:17.040]  these old rotting 35 40 year old reactors leaking now it's like all the
[54:17.040 --> 54:21.040]  reactors leaking in Illinois it's leaking in Indiana it's leaking in Texas it's
[54:21.040 --> 54:25.800]  leaking in Florida it's leaking on the East Coast oh it's leaking in Canada yeah
[54:25.800 --> 54:30.000]  we dumped some radioactive steam out and dumped in the water it's we're not
[54:30.000 --> 54:35.200]  gonna put the alarms on anymore yeah the plant by San Diego's leaking no big
[54:35.200 --> 54:39.640]  deal it's going yeah you know radiation is not all bad anymore like DU and the
[54:39.640 --> 54:43.800]  troops would let them use it till 2000 I mean until 1990 now they just say it's
[54:43.800 --> 54:49.600]  nutritious now speaking of tyranny there's a video up at info wars dot com
[54:49.600 --> 54:59.080]  and the headline if you go to the site is drones shot down over Texas and guess
[54:59.080 --> 55:04.160]  who did the shooting down well high school friends of mine the Steiner
[55:04.160 --> 55:10.960]  brothers Sid and Tommy Shane Steiner and we actually had are already
[55:10.960 --> 55:14.320]  procuring some some some more expensive drones we had to line up some
[55:14.320 --> 55:17.920]  sponsorship not to do this but that's coming up next so these are consumer
[55:17.920 --> 55:22.920]  grade but police are even getting thousand dollar units and surveillance
[55:22.920 --> 55:27.200]  people and the full video drone shot down over Texas is there following
[55:27.200 --> 55:30.680]  columnist Charles Krauthammer's observation that the first person to
[55:30.680 --> 55:35.360]  shoot down a surveillance drone on US soil will be a folk hero gun
[55:35.360 --> 55:40.760]  enthusiasts in Texas have done precisely that as a protest against the use of
[55:40.760 --> 55:44.720]  spy drones the American people and as a side issue the trolls are having a field
[55:44.720 --> 55:49.760]  day with us we say on the video we shot around the drones because we didn't want
[55:49.760 --> 55:57.200]  to blow up you know a $300 and a and another $200 drone one of them had a
[55:57.200 --> 56:00.840]  camera and that's the footage you see from the drones is being shot down we
[56:00.840 --> 56:05.440]  didn't want to just shoot it right away so we say alright shoot around it they're
[56:05.440 --> 56:09.120]  like look they shot at it ten times before they hit it these people are
[56:09.120 --> 56:14.240]  idiots okay hey we're a terrible shot okay but we're not actually you notice I
[56:14.240 --> 56:17.280]  shoot at the tenor right once it hits it it doesn't blow up at 200 yards I
[56:17.280 --> 56:20.920]  shoot it again it blows up the second time I mean I'm not the best shot in
[56:20.920 --> 56:25.040]  the world but back when I shot every week or so I could shoot at 200 yards
[56:25.040 --> 56:31.120]  through the same hole with 308 over and over and over and over again and one
[56:31.120 --> 56:34.520]  reason I want to start doing this gun show routinely is to get back into guns
[56:34.520 --> 56:39.640]  myself I mean I grabbed it 30 odd six out of my gun case I hadn't shot in about
[56:39.640 --> 56:45.240]  six years six seven years since I shot a deer at 600 yards off my uncle's porch
[56:45.240 --> 56:49.360]  in Fredericksburg he was there when I did it shot him right in the chest again
[56:49.360 --> 56:53.480]  that's not some Marine Corps sniper shot but I hadn't shot that rifle got it out
[56:53.480 --> 57:01.040]  of there Shane hadn't even shot the 2250 we're citing these in as we do it you
[57:01.040 --> 57:05.360]  know we go out there we've got a few hours he was called Shane in high school
[57:05.360 --> 57:08.560]  was full names Tommy Shane Senors always calling Shane and people are like
[57:08.560 --> 57:11.840]  what you call is he Tommy or is he Shane Tommy Shane Steiner by the way in his
[57:11.840 --> 57:17.320]  own right was a top of the charts country music singer until he retired at a
[57:17.320 --> 57:20.680]  young age and his brother is the world champion calf rope or also was a
[57:20.680 --> 57:25.680]  bull rider Sid great guys Matt of gunfighterclinic.com is a great gun
[57:25.680 --> 57:28.920]  instructor and gunsmith if you're in central Texas want to take classes from
[57:28.920 --> 57:35.120]  him he's a great guy gunfighters clinic.com but side issue the video is
[57:35.120 --> 57:39.760]  up on info wars.com right now and I'm gonna ask everybody to go get the
[57:39.760 --> 57:43.680]  article drones shot down over Texas surveillance drones blasted out of the
[57:43.680 --> 57:49.000]  sky in protest against fourth amendment intrusion and we're saying this draws
[57:49.000 --> 57:53.120]  attention to it to politically shoot them down I'm not saying you should shoot
[57:53.120 --> 57:58.600]  down the real drones but by the way there has been a drone shot down the
[57:58.600 --> 58:03.000]  animal rights activists were saying it's wrong to hunt hunt birds you know quail
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.680]  and stuff what idiots and there's nothing better going on shooting some
[58:07.680 --> 58:12.320]  quail or dove and carrying the plastic bag with you with the marination sauce
[58:12.320 --> 58:16.960]  in it ripping their little little breast out after you shot them throwing it in
[58:16.960 --> 58:22.040]  the bag it marinates when you get back cook some asparagus you know while
[58:22.040 --> 58:27.680]  that's cooking on the grill bam throw those down on the grill bam and the
[58:27.680 --> 58:33.080]  oil and a while back before I stopped a little shot of wild turkey with it I mean

[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:35.200]  freedom popular cool sexy powerful that's what it is the gun culture is
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:38.360]  defeating the new world order we beat them on one front we beat them everywhere
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.040]  we beat them on land rights and property rights we beat them on parental rights we
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.800]  beat them and we're having victories every time we get involved in fight back
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:51.000]  I'm gonna go to your calls coming up in the next segment 800-259-231 there's so
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.480]  many serious issues to cover but you know I've done two episodes of brothers
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:03.120]  and arms for prison planet TV because I understand that it is important very
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:09.560]  important extremely important to demonstrate the second amendment and to
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:15.120]  have some fun doing and that's exactly what we do so many so-called liberals
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.680]  that thought that guns came out of their cases at night and went around
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.680]  hurting children are now going out and shooting guns getting into it the
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.800]  feeling of security you know you don't have a gun in your house cuz you're a
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.080]  coward or you're fearful you have it because you're in control you have it
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:33.880]  because you're not laying down it's a really good feeling to just know there's
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.960]  a firearm there if you need to use it it's a good feeling that when she your
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.640]  children trained on safety and with firearms to know that when they grow up
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.520]  they're gonna be able to defend themselves especially daughters I'm just
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:49.680]  now I got my son into it earlier I'm just now getting my she's eight now man
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:54.760]  they get big fast into guns she's a great shot due to a lot of the BB gun
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:59.600]  stuffs the perfect way to train them first but it's just fantastic what's
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:04.400]  happening with the second amendment also with abortion most polls show over
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:10.480]  70 percent are against it just 38 years ago with Roe v. Wade the majority were
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:16.560]  for it and we reverse that we are winning on the second amendment front
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.960]  doesn't mean they're not going to try to just ban things by executive fiat like
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.240]  the ATF tried last year with most shotguns saying if you could load a clip
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.520]  in the bottom they were going to ban it no law they just did it but as the
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.760]  tyrants get desperate and and and realize that we're like in our arm
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.840]  wrestling match we're starting to push them back and they could feel we've got
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.080]  the momentum they're going to start cheating we're going to call them on
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:41.440]  that I mean really it just takes getting involved in the fight but I want to
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.800]  ask listeners again drone shot down over Texas surveillance drones blasted out of
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:49.760]  the sky and protest against fourth amendment intrusion really proud of
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:54.720]  this little eight minute video and some of the gun shows will be an hour long
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.680]  some will be 10 minutes some will be 30 minutes again because it's the internet
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:01.440]  that's the new television I mean we have more viewers on a few of our YouTube
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:05.480]  channels and most big shows on TV that have you know million-dollar episode
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:09.920]  budgets and differences we don't make all that money like they do but we're in
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:14.760]  the process of destroying that old system to where it will be a total free-for-all
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.920]  and that's where we'll win is on that level playing field you're talking
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:28.320]  about total information anarchy total bedlam total Tarzan of the age and
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.760]  that's where we're going to dominate you know Tarzan of the apes world
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:38.040]  information-wise we're going to win we're going to win and so we are already
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:42.800]  discredited the enemy citadels we're now blowing them to pieces they're
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.160]  involved in counterattacks that's good they're getting more wild they're
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.880]  squealing battle roars and you know we're going to grow up your children
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:53.520]  haha we're gonna put we're gonna put lithium in the water that'll make you
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:57.640]  submit but their own operatives are drinking it as well they've got the
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:01.720]  weak people working for them so the soft kill they use on us really hurts them
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:05.800]  and those of us that were already stronger it's hurting us but it doesn't
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.280]  matter in a way the soft kill that's meant to keep us under control is
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:12.960]  actually making it where their minions just don't have just don't have what it
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.520]  takes that's why they're putting most of their minions on steroids and other
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:22.160]  drugs now in an attempt to get them suit back up to go around and have some
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:26.520]  energy but it doesn't matter they're badly coordinated and by engaging them
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:30.760]  we're gonna sap their strength because we're organic and we just keep coming
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:36.240]  like waves bam bam bam bam bam we get stronger they get weaker so just
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.880]  absolutely know that you got a hold of their arm like bale wolf's Grendel's

[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:37.840]  here I come back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. and we have info wars nightly nose and this
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:44.720]  week we're gonna have anchoring I make a mistake of trying to eat a late
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:50.080]  breakfast during the break and then get something down the wrong way look out I
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:57.240]  am here in Virginia and we are broadcasting worldwide and we have
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.160]  almost gotten to Chantilly where the Bilderbergs are gonna be meeting this
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:04.840]  year there's finally mainstream media coverage of it thanks to our listeners
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:08.360]  getting the word out also drudge report the last four years covering it we have
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:14.000]  a lot of breaking news on that front coming up it's an info wars com also we
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:22.440]  have the huge news going on right now and that is radioactive tuna the feds
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:29.560]  didn't tell us about that's been arriving in the u.s. Pacific Northwest since
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:36.440]  last year since August of last year in San Diego and it is also bringing in
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:42.280]  other radioactive fish in the entire Pacific Northwest but they say hey
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:48.600]  it's not a big deal the amount of radioactive cesium cesium in the fish
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:53.800]  is not thought it's not thought to be damaging to people if consumed because
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:58.080]  the FDA and EPA last year raised the levels in some cases over a thousand
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:03.800]  times what they say is safe just absolutely off the charts we're gonna
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:08.000]  be getting into that also it's the big media issue Bain Capital and the fact
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.760]  that it's financing
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:19.040]  Obama and Mitt Romney we're gonna be going over that report well we also have
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:23.600]  the latest on the person now we're told bath salts caused the man to turn into
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:26.920]  his basically a zombie and start eating the other person's face off a whole
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:30.960]  story sounds very very weird first it's cocaine then it's lsd now it's bath
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:35.520]  salts the video I see from the police first arrive one cop you don't see him
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:39.560]  shoot them they admit in the news yes that's the original video people thought
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:44.920]  when I showed it over the weekend you know on the road video feed we we did
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:50.240]  and posted at info wars dot com that we were showing after the police had arrived
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:54.840]  no they admit that is the full footage and there's two guys laying there no
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:59.400]  one's moving and supposedly this guy is eating the guy's face and refused to
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:04.880]  stop and growled so the cops shooting but I'm watching the full footage you
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.760]  can't see the full cops you you don't see the feet of all of them and the guy's
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:16.480]  not moving so something's going on here and that's all I'm saying and I guess
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.640]  that's it they got to ban all the bath salts that are sold in stores because
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.280]  it'll it'll make you go lay on the side of the road naked and eat somebody's
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:30.800]  face and again I'm not saying it couldn't be true I'm just questioning a
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:36.720]  system known to lie and if that's bad I understand I'm evil so we've got that
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:41.440]  report as well coming up I've got a lot of other points I want to go over after
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:46.520]  we take a whole parcel of your calls after we take a ton of phone calls we're
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.920]  going to get into all of that no guests today because I want to be able to take
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:54.840]  your calls tomorrow I'll be on the ground doing the show from right there in
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.840]  the hotel where Bilderberg will start arriving the day after that and also be
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.000]  out on the street some as well but we're gonna have a lot of people to
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.600]  interview that are gonna be there like Jim Tucker Charlie Skelton of the
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:13.800]  Guardian is gonna be on the ground there and so many others I want to thank all
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.720]  of you that have heard the call to come out to Bilderberg 2012 this is a big deal
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.880]  they've increased security they're very very upset we have moles up one side and
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:28.400]  down the other they are definitely fit to be tied right now lastly before I go
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:34.360]  back to your calls we shot a video last Monday and rushed to finish it before we
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:39.280]  left Saturday and the video was uploaded this morning it is now going
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:45.240]  mega viral drones shot down over Texas surveillance drones blasted out of the
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:51.760]  sky in protest against fourth amendment intrusion and we have some fun with them
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:56.720]  with some dragon's breath at about 200 feet and I shot dragons breath about 15
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.920]  years ago it was much more powerful I guess somebody must have got on to him
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.240]  or something or I got a bad batch or a knockoff but we bought I don't know like
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:09.400]  60 shells of it and some of them were halfway powerful others were like
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:13.360]  duds and would barely even shoot out of the shotgun because we wanted to toy with
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:16.840]  the with the drones first so we you know shoot some dragons breath at the
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:22.600]  helicopter and one of us had hit it with 223 I'm like oh I go ahead and shoot
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.360]  with 223 so we shoot it it goes through the blades blows one blade off there's
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:30.200]  two sets of blades knocks shoots right through one blade and then it slowed down
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:34.000]  enough to just break the other blade you know when it went through so it starts
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.760]  falling and the dragons breath hits it feet and makes it flip over pretty
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:44.080]  dramatic footage and that's just the helicopter now you know those helicopters
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.840]  they use in Hollywood movie sets they cost about $10,000 and that's stripped
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.200]  down police departments are getting them they're about three or four times the
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.320]  size of the helicopter we shot down they're about one-tenth the scale of a
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:03.280]  real helicopter we've got a listener who is willing perhaps with sponsorship or
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:07.840]  maybe let us if we pay a little bit blow up one of his old ones but with live
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:12.960]  cameras on it perhaps we'll have it up in the air while we shoot other drones
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.920]  down it's going to be amazing you watch a bunch of other people are going to do
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:19.520]  this better than we did now there's a new race I'm sure but we're the first to
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:24.840]  shoot down our own drones in a protest and that video is at info wars.com you
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:29.520]  can also find it right there on our Twitter at realalexchones twitter.com
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:33.480]  for slash realalexchones then we also blow up some little ground vehicles with

[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:03.880]  Arizona and I haven't been there in a while but I went to a park there one
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:11.240]  time and I saw a military drill and a park and I told my mother to stop by so
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:16.280]  I can ask questions because I've been listening to your show for a while and I
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:20.880]  have a question and nobody didn't seem to know why they were there but they
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:27.000]  said that they're there for security and yes they have regular army regular
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.040]  Marines National Guard State Guard and State Guard can actually do it
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:34.960]  constitutionally during an emergency National Guard it's it's high school
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:40.200]  it's a middle school football plays it's an acclimation program the Pentagon
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:44.720]  admits it they're getting rid of posse commentatus Kentucky Derby NFL games
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:49.640]  hockey games the national draft it's always troops troops troops where where
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:53.720]  our national identity is the troops but not them individually they're treated
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:56.600]  like crud you know they're sending them back in the battle now with arms and
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:59.800]  legs blown off nobody's ever done that making them do it by the way
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:04.400]  Beals that went crazy had had his most his foot blown off and was forced back
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.400]  in and put on Prozac but don't worry he'll get prison time for what they did
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:12.080]  to him and the guy was out of his mind he was he was he was temporarily insane
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:16.920]  I'm not saying what he did was good but you can't put him in prison and and yeah
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:19.800]  the average troops don't really know why they're there I mean I remember
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:25.880]  covering urban warfare drills that were unannounced in Miami in Houston in San
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:31.760]  Antonio in old St. Louis everywhere and they would go in Lisa building blow it
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:36.680]  up in broad daylight or at 3 p.m. I mean 3 a.m. media would cover it and the
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:41.200]  national media would say did not exist you are a black helicopter person and I
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:44.480]  have an interview police chief so they tried to bribe and talk to people that
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:48.440]  had heart attacks at the nursing home next door and I'd go on air and national
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:53.200]  media would say this person is insane this doesn't exist now they do have them
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:57.040]  everywhere in broad daylight getting you ready and admit it's real and they
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:00.440]  admit oh yeah the troops are trained into come for you and your family again
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:03.160]  they got to get the troops where they think it's normal they got to get the
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:07.800]  cops where they think it's normal buddy they now have TSA checkpoints so so you
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:12.600]  were in Yuma and and and was it army was it Marines was it National Guard who
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:17.880]  was out there at the park a little like a bunch of Marines and they have like
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:24.120]  every type of vehicle like from hummers to even the big the really big machine
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:30.920]  the big that you see on the that I didn't see it on your TV shows and I
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:35.040]  actually asked a couple of people they said well we're here for scary that's it
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:38.480]  and then it went from that and then they kind of walked away and and Hispanic
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:43.080]  guy walked up towards me and you know cuz I'm Hispanic and I said hey man what's
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:47.160]  going on over here you like you know look he looked left and he looked to the
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:52.000]  right he's like he showed his shoulder he's like I don't even I'm here so he
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.840]  kind of said that and I kind of know what right away I was like wow you know
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:06.520]  but I was also seeing the TV show on NATO in Chicago and the blue colored hat
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:11.840]  it kind of reminded me of the UN troop that color no no no that's what they're
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:15.960]  doing they're now they have US troops in black berets and now they're saying they
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:20.280]  may start having special units were blue it's all just an acclimation they're
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:25.080]  standardizing the guns standardizing the codes standardizing the uniforms putting
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:30.280]  our troops under NATO under UN remember private new specialist protesting it
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:35.320]  this is what they do exactly and it's again the troops aren't bad they're
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:39.360]  being acclimated the police are being acclimated we're being acclimated but
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:42.480]  because we've been here and you've been there warning people the troops are
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:47.600]  going oh now it makes sense they got Marines doing DWI checkpoints nationwide

[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:18.280]  extension of what began in the old one it has patterned itself after every
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:22.120]  dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:28.040]  history since the beginning of time it has refinements technological advances
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:33.480]  and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:39.280]  every one of the super states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:43.120]  is an enemy and truth is a menace
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:34:00.880]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:08.560]  I will be hurtling back down the road toward our final destination on this
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:13.440]  trip before turning back around and pointing the RV at Texas I will be
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:19.760]  there in Washington DC the place named after the founder of our country a man
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:25.840]  of innumerable courage and honor George Washington who undoubtedly is spinning
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:29.440]  in his grave to see what's happened look at the trolls in this article drone
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:34.680]  shot down over Texas in the amazing video up at info wars.com and and they're
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:37.640]  all hitting the same thing they're saying it's disinfo or they're saying
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:41.040]  anti-Semitic stuff and we've tracked these IPs before it's it's it's
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:44.120]  corporations and feds they do that just to make it negative it's like look at
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:48.000]  the Jewish Steiner Steiner brothers and it's like a big big joke is wouldn't be
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.040]  bad if they were Jewish they're they're German I can look at them and tell that
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:55.840]  but it's just funny because they you know like they use that term Steiner's
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:59.440]  actually a noble German name from Austria if you want to be technical but
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.280]  the point is that when to high school these guys it's like look at these
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:07.600]  Jewish guys with Jones they're funded by Tel Aviv that's the talking point they
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:15.760]  put out but the most popular one they put out is what the F Paul Watson we have
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:23.120]  a fourth amendment right to be secure not private it's not there to protect you
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:29.680]  from embarrassment it's your right to not have your security and safety
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:34.120]  violated and that's got to be a cop I bet money that's a military person MP type
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:38.200]  who's probably 22 really dumb down we can track the IPs we've done before it's
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:41.760]  right back to the Department of Defense or think tanks and they've been they
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.960]  about with the Pentagon admits they've been doing this for at least a decade but
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:48.840]  now they're saying well we're gonna lie online about people in the US and on TV
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:57.000]  as part of black propaganda psyops we want $46 million to do it in 2013 that's
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:03.640]  in the new NDAA that's past the house Christian Science Monitor associated
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:08.440]  press Reuters secret kill list secret kills are oh none of that was coming now
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:14.480]  it's on the books because I've seen cops say you've got a right to be secure and
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:19.320]  I'm here to make sure under public safety I keep you safe so I'm gonna taser
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:24.840]  you and they actually teach the cops this there is no fourth amendment go in
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:30.040]  any house any car we want they have a right to be safe and secure personally
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:33.600]  and eyes and all of us are ever right to be safe that's why I'm only use they're
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:37.200]  now putting something called a howler sound can and then actually rattles
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:41.200]  your organs in the police cars and then I played a clip of it on a video I did
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:45.600]  last night from the RV and the cops like I want you to hear me see me and
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:51.760]  feel me and this lady goes it's scary and they hit him with a sound weapon and
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:56.000]  again they're just gonna keep upping the power but continuing here listen to this
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.360]  yeah now they turn their siren on it's gonna have a little sound weapon that
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:03.920]  rattles your insides this is Cornell law University for the cops and the feds

[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:09.720]  or things to be seized can't have big drag nets can't listen and read all the
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:12.920]  emails because somebody might do something wrong can't do door-to-door gun
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:15.880]  searches because somebody might have something that's illegal can't search
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:19.360]  everybody's bags somebody might have drugs or a bomb that the government
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:24.880]  shipped in can't have a drone and I have legal experts clips in the videos
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:27.600]  while they're so mad about how it's illegal for a drone to come down and

[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:18.280]  he probably loves drones or something let's go ahead and talk to Janet and
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:23.200]  master on the air Janet hi Alex thank you so much you're making me laugh you do
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:26.600]  that so well you bring up the Constitution you educate people with
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:31.040]  even mainstream news which is almost impossible right and I've been listening
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:34.960]  to you for years in the People's Republic of Massachusetts and I just have
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:37.880]  two things I don't know if you're aware but but the Massachusetts Republican
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:40.680]  Party is trying to get rid of the delegates tonight that we elected for
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:44.720]  the Ron Paul Liberty campaign oh yeah I mean Ron Paul wanted a bunch of states
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:47.880]  they've even had to admit the New York Times but they're gonna try to block all
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:50.880]  those delegates that's what they do you've got to have vain capital candidate
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:55.960]  a or b both men run by the same megabanks so true it is so true we're
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:45:00.560]  having approaches down at the holiday in and Marlboro if any of the math listeners
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:03.520]  you know can join us that would be great starting at six o'clock they're gonna
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:08.720]  try and have a vote to disqualify all those delegates at 6 30 tonight and the
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:12.960]  other thing was I was with a bunch of people and I think they were mostly
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:16.360]  obot supporters on Nantucket this weekend and I don't know why they put up
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:19.440]  with me and Craig because we keep going after them saying do you know what's
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:23.440]  really going on are you aware of what's really going on finally one of them said
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:29.040]  yes but I can't handle it and when I start talking about the real power of
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:32.760]  people the energetic power of people they kind of calm down and they can
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:37.000]  listen better so I was wondering if you could get people on like Richard Bartlett
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.920]  of Matrix energetics and Lynn McTagger of the intention experiment and even
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:46.560]  Raymond Grace who's a hilly-billy dows there he they've all been on coast to
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:50.640]  coast and they can help people see that we are more powerful than this I don't
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:55.360]  know how we can stop the radiation without figuring out how we can heal
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:58.800]  each other energetically and it's been working for me I've seen some miracles
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:03.880]  over tell you how you heal yourself you just do what the FDA and EPA did and you
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:06.800]  just tell everybody that it's fine and that radiation is now good for you like
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:10.200]  the government says and don't be a conspiracy terrorist radiation is good
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:14.400]  for you the DU is good for the troops now the Pentagon said they couldn't use it
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:21.520]  until you know 1990 or so and said it was totally deadly but now they said it's
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:24.600]  good for you and the troops are dying and having burnt defects with their
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:27.360]  children from it that's just another blessing of government I appreciate your
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:31.680]  call guys I know we've got studio quality audio to you via that system but I
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:37.200]  lost my Skype and I'm on a PC here which I'm not used to and I don't need the
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:42.200]  people to come in the room it's fine I can get the network to fix it but it
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:45.680]  dropped and it kept saying click here and I was clicking to bring the video
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:49.160]  back up Houston I know it's really awesome but it's kind of cool like we're
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:52.640]  up here floating around the planet what do I click here to have you guys
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:55.760]  reconnect when you're calling me because it's a blue interface not the normal
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:47:01.840]  green and white one yeah no I knew it was offline and it was sitting there
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:04.880]  beeping for about five minutes while that lady was talking listen I know we're
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:11.800]  offline what I'm saying is it shows we're still online you know I know we're
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:15.240]  offline we don't need to have a discussion about that if you'll just as I
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:19.000]  said reconnect and tell me what to click I'll do that because I don't know with
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.840]  this PC interface let's go to another phone call before we go to break here
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:26.560]  you guys can just tell me what the caller what I click on here let's go
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:33.160]  ahead and talk to Jerry in Colorado who says he disagrees Jerry go ahead yes
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:37.560]  Alex about people trying to shoot down drones the only thing that worries me
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:42.720]  about that is somebody taking a centerfire rifle and launching around up
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:47.600]  in the air you know no backstop over the horizon and what goes up must come down
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:52.200]  and it reminds me of every New Year's Eve in a big city where it's a
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:56.040]  celebratory fire yeah but we were on the middle of a 10,000 acre ranch five
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:01.000]  miles from any settlement so it's it's fine but yes obviously everybody knows
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.640]  that our point is is that is that people are talking about shooting drones
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:10.360]  down and if you let these people push this celebratory fire thing you got a
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:13.040]  better chance of being killed by a you know great white shark there's only
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:16.920]  about two of those a year and you do from celebratory fire that's hyped to shut
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:20.040]  down all the gun ranges that's what that's about they're trying to shut
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:24.960]  police gun ranges down and so that's I've looked into that that's a bunch of hype
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:29.480]  made-up garbage I mean yes you know some of the folks in the old Wild West stuff
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:33.280]  or you know the Muslim countries every every four or five years somebody gets
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:37.400]  hit by one of these things but I'm not saying and I say in the video such such
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:41.640]  a nanny state go out and shoot down drones we say don't do that shoot them
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:45.880]  down politically but it's fine to go out in the middle of a ranch and shoot a
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:49.680]  helicopter when there's you know when you're five miles from the next fence
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:56.280]  line right I understand that I'm not sure if it's a rare thing is you might
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:01.800]  think where I go shoot in a rural area in northern Colorado here the the lands
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:06.000]  are spread out over thousands of acres where people can set up sites and it's
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.600]  not unheard of at all for somebody to launch one over the horizon and have a
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:17.040]  near miss or hit a ranch building yeah yeah if you if you shoot a 50 caliber
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:22.400]  perfectly it might go four miles two to three it's about two miles if you look
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.600]  at that but I mean hell according to that then I've seen Marine Corps
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:28.760]  demonstrations from Camp Pendleton where they all fire tracers up in the sky to
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:33.000]  make a design and you know they're out there on a 10,000 acre rancher so maybe
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.120]  they should just ban that ban all guns because ban that guy's teeth because he
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:41.120]  bit that guy what do you think of that well I'm all in favor of resisting the
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:46.120]  warrantless unconstitutional mass surveillance that's great I just let me
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:50.400]  ask you this question if you were an Antarctica could you shoot a gun up in
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:55.480]  the air Alex I'm yeah I understand it's not a perfectly safe world I'm just
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:59.120]  saying some people with guns don't really understand ballistics and some of
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:02.560]  them aren't that thoughtful and you'd have to be anti Oakley to hit one at any
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:08.080]  hide anyway so I just think that'd be a good public service announcement to
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:12.000]  explain to people that that can be risk no I know but there's it but you see how
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.480]  those announcements could be I mean every time I got in my car to shoot a
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:20.080]  video say now cars are dangerous so if you ever drive a car don't have a head
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:23.400]  on collision I mean I hear what you're saying but I mean you know you notice we
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:26.920]  make the point in the video that you couldn't be in a safer place in the
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:32.880]  middle of a 10,000 acre ranch and your point sir but listen I happened to have
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:35.880]  looked into that before even did it did you know they're trying to shut police
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:40.240]  ranges down because oh well the police range is a mile away from people and a
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:44.600]  bullet might bounce out let's ban those I mean I mean I think they're using the
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:48.440]  celebratory fire thing as a pretext of ban guns outright you see what I'm
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:53.840]  saying I do but listen I hear your point we probably should add a little blurb
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:58.640]  blit on the article about that oh obviously you know you can't do this
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:00.960]  unless you're in the middle of nowhere but we're not saying shoot drones down to
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:06.680]  begin with folks have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch
[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:10.560]  to the lights back on if so this is going to be the most important message
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:14.160]  you'll ever hear because there's never been a better time to get ready for the
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:18.560]  winter power outages ahead here's why solar powered generators are now
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:22.640]  available from our friends at solutions from science one of our oldest sponsors

[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:49.960]  now and take another phone call let's talk to Dr. Jones in Mexico who's been
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:55.040]  patiently holding Dr. Jones you're on the air thank you so much Alex Jones let
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:55:02.240]  me quickly read a few points to confirm and add providence to what you said the
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:05.840]  whole world is really following the same program I've been able to live in
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:09.920]  Europe Canada Mexico and I've seen the same things with the police state the
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:14.120]  black uniforms and a lot of us is predicated and people have to understand
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:18.920]  this on the drug war the drug war the drug war and we said before you know you
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:22.480]  just talked about the drones and spying with the courts of rule the courts of
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:26.680]  rule the opposite Alex Dave said that the government can spy on you anytime they
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:30.760]  want as long as it's in plain sight they can fly over you with a helicopter they
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:34.360]  can use heat detectors and see what's coming up all in the name of fighting
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:38.760]  drugs and as you've noted this the script has been switched to them turn on
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:43.240]  terrorism domestic terrorism etc now it's not al-qaeda al-qaeda were told as the
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:46.600]  good guys I'm unpatriotic because I don't support them being given Syria and
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:50.280]  Libya al-qaeda blows up police stations over there supposedly liberal and loving
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.560]  and then now they say oh it's the domestic threat those that don't like
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:57.440]  the new world order because we're the people that are right we understand the
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:01.560]  country is being captured it's been taken over by traders it's so elementary
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:06.400]  and what's happened is this was Republican as well as Democratic appointee
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:11.080]  judges saying it's all good because it's in the name of drugs and it's expanded
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:14.760]  the police state now I have to switch gears a little bit focusing again on the
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:19.480]  vaccines I'm doing a major study right now I'm looking at UN data world or help
[01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:23.680]  that of the whole world I'm like I said in Mexico they're doing PSAs telling
[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:27.720]  people to get five in one vaccines making sure you get vaccinated they're
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:33.120]  advocating women over 40 oh no they're lying in the in the Mexican news because
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:37.880]  I've seen it in the US news and saying it's the law to take the five in one to
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:41.520]  little babies that's a guaranteed brain damage or I mean literally they're
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:45.200]  trying to turn the entire Mexican population into a servile mildly
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:49.760]  retarded mass like the average American I mean this is so nightmarish and the
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:55.880]  la reconquista la rasa groups that say oh the machismo get whitey they're all
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:59.960]  foundation funded they will never tell their people it's like be liberal get an
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:04.280]  abortion kill your baby be liberal take the shots brain damage your baby and
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:09.960]  shut up whitey Alex I mean it's so ridiculous it's globalist that do want
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:15.080]  to exterminate the people in Mexico posing as if they care about the people
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:21.080]  more in Canada we just had an outbreak of pertussis I went and read the insert
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:27.360]  the insert says it neither prevents nor causes pertussis there's no evidence it
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:31.520]  works I asked a pharmacist in Canada why are you telling people to take this when
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:35.080]  she says well it'll work I said how will it work I read the insert it says it
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:39.920]  doesn't work at all no the Gardasil says it doesn't protect you from it it's all
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:45.600]  a hoax they've never gotten the flu shot right predicting the next year what
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:50.680]  it's going to be they released the H1N1 that came out as a quote simulant it
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:55.240]  doubles your chances of getting the flu the next year that's major studies yes
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:59.800]  it's all a giant stinking criminal hoax the Federal Reserve is private the New
[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:03.080]  World Order is a fraud these countries aren't bankrupt they've been signed on
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:08.800]  to the bankers derivatives it's all a fraud yes sir point and that's why they
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:11.880]  know parents are waking up and not vaccinating their kids so now they're
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:14.760]  saying we'll just vaccinate them even if you're even if you say no go ahead I'm
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:20.760]  sorry again in Canada again because I'm letting people know this is a global plan
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:25.000]  in Canada of course they have carbon taxes but they also advocate fluoride
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.920]  health Canada says fluoride's good helpful this any other I'm showing the

[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:40.520]  tomorrow but a bunch of big guests lined up a lot of inside Intel it's gonna be
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:44.200]  breaking the day and tomorrow at info wars dot com our big articles already
[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:48.320]  been at drugs report dot com on them beefing up massive security increases
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:54.080]  yesterday we're gonna continue with your calls in this hour we had a caller
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:58.040]  earlier who was raising the point that hey I know you guys are on a big giant
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:00.920]  uninhabited ranch shooting at drones but you'd better tell people don't shoot at
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:05.240]  drones I've already told people don't shoot at drones we shot down our own
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:09.160]  drones to bring attention to the fact that it's unconstitutional to see the
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:12.360]  info in the video but the caller did make some good points though I sounded
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:15.640]  snippy it was because my video feed was dropping at the time and I get irritable
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:20.800]  when for three days in a row I've got about four hours sleep each night and we
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:24.320]  try to cram too much in but yes that's a good point you make so later I'll add
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:27.440]  that to the article but I mean my god at a certain point people obviously have to
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:32.320]  know that I mean that's what we say don't shoot drones down we have crowd
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:35.560]  hammer in the video saying that as well but it's just we're always provides
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:39.200]  only everything with a globalist or raining radiation down on us stealing
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:42.360]  our country bankrupting everything they've turned us into a bunch of ninnies
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:46.360]  that's why I blow up at that all right going back to somebody exposing from
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:52.080]  Mexico Dr. Jones was bringing up the fact that the fluoride in the water the
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:56.300]  vaccines they admit don't even protect you in the inserts it's such a giant
[02:01:56.300 --> 02:02:00.400]  hoax that's why I'm so frustrated so Dr. Jones finish your point then we'll go
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:07.800]  Dan Michael or Michelle and then Jerry Colin and others go ahead thank you so
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:13.000]  a couple quick points about radiation detectors in the airports there was just
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.320]  a study in Canada and the professor was interviewed by one of the newspapers she
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:22.200]  says it's no harm don't worry it barely goes through the skin and oh by the way
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:26.040]  she just happened to be working on an invention to get a contract from the
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:30.200]  Canadian government to put the radiation scanners in the airports so again it's
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:35.440]  not just the United States it's all over last little point in Mexico I noticed a
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:39.360]  couple of sports stadiums they have barbed wire the barbed wire is not there
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:44.760]  to keep people out they're pointed to keep people in so again Alex they're
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:49.560]  just reiterating and and demonstrating what you've already said and another
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:53.840]  voice to say look I've seen it firsthand people have to wake up they got a fight
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:57.440]  for drug legalization they got a fight to get rid of the fluoride and well
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:01.520]  that was a woman who called you months ago on a Sunday and she said just get
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:05.680]  more information before you vaccinate she was she was crying her son has been
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:10.280]  damaged people you cannot vaccinate your child no this is not a joke it's why
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:16.200]  I'm so angry they've gone from one in 25,000 plus or is it one in 25,300 or so
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:21.720]  to one in 58 I mean this is not a game ladies and gentlemen every time I'm on
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:25.400]  vacation I see autistic children at the pool and I'll say when did your son
[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:29.120]  become autistic at 18 months what happened that you gave him the third
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:33.240]  round of shots yeah had a convulsion in the car had a convulsion that night had
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:36.800]  a convulsion in the doctor's office and now I saw a month ago where doctors are
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:40.120]  putting out a little paper saying now your child's probably gonna have a
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:45.480]  convulsion but that's good for them they might not talk again but that's good
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:49.720]  for them too we love you the system see once the system does all this evil and
[02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:52.680]  the minions get into it not because they're evil but because they were
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:55.880]  gullible they're gonna defend it even more they're not gonna admit they were
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:04:00.600]  wrong do you understand that they're not gonna demand it yeah I saw it in
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:03.680]  Canada I've seen in Mexico I've seen in the United States I've seen doctor and
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:07.560]  nurse I got students whose brothers and sisters are doctors and they said but it
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:11.160]  can't be alive because why would they tell us in medical school why would they
[02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:15.360]  tell us in nursing school why and I tell them to read the inserts read they
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:19.200]  told you that there was no dangerous dust when the EPA's own report said as
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:23.960]  best as concrete glass dust totally deadly red alert no one in there but
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:27.360]  with respirators for months and they just said tell everybody it's good for
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:31.480]  them and then the big you know famous your singer just died she lived in the
[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:34.560]  area they told her it was safe she believed him believing the new world
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:39.160]  order will kill you and again the people serving it are going along with it
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:45.080]  it's mass collective psychosis a mixture of learned helplessness combined with
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:49.760]  Stockholm mass Stockholm syndrome normalcy bias and cognitive dissonance
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:55.840]  that's it well I am sane I am a lake this nanny state is meant to kill us
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:04:59.760]  it's not meant to save us they want us as prisoners this is all prisoner

[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:31.040]  of these big brokerage leverage buyout groups that Mitt Romney formerly headed
[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:35.080]  is funding Romney and Obama and the Democrats are saying to some of their
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:39.600]  operatives don't criticize Bain this is really showing the emperor has no

[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:24.200]  of a tour of the interior of the DHS Customs and Border Protection P3 surveillance
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:29.400]  aircraft that's got the big frisbee on the roof and I wanted to get that to you
[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:33.320]  guys my computers took a hit from lightning I can't do anything with it
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:39.760]  oh that happens I've had that happen before myself I mean absolutely it's
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:43.160]  not just a little unmanned ones they've got all these big giant systems just
[02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:48.400]  scooping everything up illegally because this is all illegal domestically yes
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:52.840]  sir and I also have on the tape that they they actually have nine of the
[02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:59.240]  Protor B drones operational domestically here oh yeah no that's
[02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:04.120]  admitted again once cows have come on your property once and this family
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:08.560]  said it happened more than 20 times once they keep breaking over your fence
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:12.840]  ago in your property you're allowed to keep them and they kept a few cows on
[02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:17.440]  their 3,000 acre ranch they used an Air Force Predator drone in North Dakota with
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:22.520]  the local police what in North Korea in Mexico the military takes over that is
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:27.360]  the elites use it to take over that's why it's always been illegal the spines
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:32.080]  illegal the military involves illegal the CIA domestically is illegal it's all
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:36.680]  illegal that's why we made the video to draw attention to it we shot down our
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:41.000]  own little drones our own little toy drones not really I mean a lot of these
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:44.480]  what police are actually using to bring attention to the fact that they're
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:50.400]  illegal go ahead yes sir it was it was really interesting the aircrew of this
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:55.400]  aircraft were all wearing well not all of them but half of them were wearing the
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:11:02.120]  long shoulder holsters with glocks and two magazines and handcuffs and I was
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:05.400]  thinking to myself well if you're in an aircraft at 20,000 feet what do you need
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:10.160]  a handgun and handcuffs for no no no they're arming everybody that they're
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:13.800]  arming everybody they're arming groups that were never even armed before they
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:17.760]  have the Department of Education swat team people when they don't even have
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:22.240]  sworn officers to tell them to pay bills when you can't swat team someone
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:27.520]  over the debt do you understand the magnitude of evil sir yes sir I do
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:31.280]  that's why I'm gonna be there with you Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:36.280]  obviously it was rhetorical I finished the rest of your story so so I mean so
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:39.400]  you actually asked them why are you flying around airplanes dressed up like
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:46.800]  cops no I they were pretty nervous about my Sony Z1U you know that's a pretty
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:51.240]  large video camera and I think they were holding back just a little bit I
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:54.920]  didn't want to ask too many questions I let the people that were with me on the
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:59.280]  tour asked the questions this was during the joint services open house air show
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:03.520]  at Andrews Air Force Base two weekends ago well you can't have an enemy I'm
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:07.800]  a little bit they work for the foreign bankers now you're a designated enemy
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:13.680]  you're not allowed to ask questions I mean of course you're an enemy I was
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:18.560]  there to gather intelligence and sneak away well tell us what else you saw at
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:24.760]  the the the loving little predators they they didn't have any predators there
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:30.200]  they had one of their four engine thousand horsepower go fast 40 foot
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:39.400]  boats there they had the UH one Huey helicopter black beautiful man I mean
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:44.120]  this thing was but those don't exist sir those do not exist they admit now they
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:50.360]  have got UN troops training in America in the different FEMA drills like NLE09
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:54.720]  but they still don't exist sir when you drive up to a checkpoint with TSA about
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:57.560]  to grow up your family doesn't exist because that doesn't happen a free
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:04.240]  country yeah they the it was really interesting to see that all the people
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:08.200]  that didn't look like they were really from America we're all sitting in this
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:13.080]  aircraft getting their pictures taken and I'm I'm thinking that with the
[02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:16.280]  emblems on the side of everything they're telling their friends to come on
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:22.080]  man you know they're not going to do anything to us it was the impression I
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:27.120]  got from uh you know all these people that were around these aircraft posing
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:32.280]  on the steps yeah well well well none dare call it treason but when it is
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:37.160]  treason none do get call it that because when treason prevails it is treason to
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:41.600]  fight treason but I mean it's all over the news they're training dozens of
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:44.840]  foreign governments to take on the American people I mean we are an eye for
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:50.640]  open zone we are the enemy we fund the global empire then we take the blame
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:55.560]  then we're enslaved and domestically occupied that is the public plan and if
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:58.920]  they got to pay 22 billion dollars to move General Motors to China they do it
[02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:03.720]  I mean it is just selling us out one way and the other god bless you sir
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:10.760]  anything else you'd like to add I'll see you on Thursday I'll have on a UCI
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:17.040]  baseball cap and a journey response team t-shirt
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:21.920]  don't in the big old camera one thing I'd like to offer that you should do
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:26.640]  before you leave Virginia is go to Jefferson's house I would love to go
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:31.960]  to Jefferson's house you know I've been to the Hermitage in Nashville when I
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:36.960]  was a child but if we would have had time in Nashville exercise took precedent
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:41.160]  for an hour and a half we want a seven mile hike but let's be technical six
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:45.280]  and a half mile hike and I didn't have time to go to the Hermitage but but
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:48.360]  somebody would like to see that as well God bless you but again that's Thomas
[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:54.080]  Jefferson that I have FEMA on video teaching police was a terrorist there's
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:57.080]  the bad guy teaching you Thomas Jefferson's bad I mean it's like a no
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:01.040]  brainer I mean it happened folks we got takeover by foreign banks they've got
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:05.280]  our military they're turning it inward on us the military is waking up but in a
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:09.080]  way it doesn't matter because it's all going drone and then they've got again
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:13.480]  they've got on small rivers they've got machine gun boats driving around now
[02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:17.280]  pulling people over that are bass fishing this is in the news where people
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:21.080]  in the heartland you name it not even on the border I'll be sitting there
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:25.480]  fishing and a big old jet boat pulls up with guys in SWAT uniforms with MP5's
[02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:30.840]  and mounted machine guns because everybody wants to be James Bond but
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:34.480]  he's not fighting you know the evil guy from Moonraker when he's driving around
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:38.880]  in his jet boat in Brazil they just pull up and they you're the enemy and
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:42.120]  it's like their warriors you and your wife and kids are the enemy and you're
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:46.720]  just looking at them and it's like it's just it's so sad it's just and of course
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:49.240]  their whole future is about to be destroyed as well but they think
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:53.920]  defending the system is patriotism the system is a foreign bank occupation
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:16:00.560]  system oh boy again our video going mega viral right now drone shot down over

[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:36.480]  thrown out because they were making you have waiting periods they find it
[02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:40.520]  unconstitutional so the feds just say okay we'll just do an instant check and
[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:44.560]  then refuse you if we want no judge no jury and then they sort of wait waiting a
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:47.920]  week or two there were lawsuits they said okay we'll make an instant again it's
[02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:52.120]  not instant anymore sometimes you have to wait weeks or they just deny you and you
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:55.640]  call the FBI and they go fill out a form maybe we'll do something it's like the
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:25:01.600]  no-fly list and now we learn the FBI put people on no-fly list and then comes to

[02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:23.800]  horrible it I mean does anyone really want to live in this world but they get
[02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:26.560]  a bunch of people under peer pressure to work for the government who
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:30.120]  incrementally will do whatever they're told so we got to cut the money off we
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:33.600]  got to shrink the size of this thing 30,000 drones to surveil us but the
[02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:41.040]  borders are wide open okay up first here I want to move quick now because I got a
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:43.280]  bunch of news coming up in the next segment then we'll continue with calls

[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:56.320]  hey it's a privilege to talk to you I really thank you for your courage
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:02.040]  getting people to wake up out there and to see what's going on people are
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:06.200]  they're just living in this matrix you try to talk to him you try to tell him
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:10.840]  what's going on and it's just like all they care about is sports entertainment
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:18.760]  they're just zoned out well I mean look TV is the is the prime mover it's the
[02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:23.800]  ether in which the zombies swim TV is the ether in which the zombies swim and
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:30.120]  they swim like dead anchors on the bottom of the deep blue sea it's our job to
[02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:33.560]  not be mad at them these are mindless victims who were in a trench you know
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:37.960]  literally most of the public who you can't talk to now as a glazed look they
[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:45.600]  are in a near-sleep walking face I was so tired last night Richard's in here in
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:51.880]  the bed next to me and he said yeah we've got to bed about 2 30 and about
[02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:55.680]  four I heard you get up and go and open the door and I don't really sleep walk
[02:26:55.680 --> 02:27:00.160]  but if I get really really tired and I hear something I'll just get up in fact
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:04.160]  I'll be really here something I'll get up and look out but the fact I'm like
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:07.080]  Richard think we'll get your own room and we won't save money because that's
[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:11.640]  probably not good for you to even be in here and you know I wouldn't call it
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:14.720]  night terrors but every once in a while I'm really tired I get up really angry
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:21.320]  and but to make a long story short people are in a trance kind of like I
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:26.880]  was last night at 4 a.m. when I heard a noise and jumped out of bed go ahead yeah
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:32.640]  the the New World Order they're alive and well in northeast Ohio they're going
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:37.960]  in these smaller towns outside of cities you know you got Cleveland Youngstown
[02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:43.480]  Akron Canton some of these small towns right outside of these cities they're
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:48.720]  going in and they're making huge four-lane roads into these towns they're
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:53.720]  putting up all these extra tall poles and putting cameras all over them and
[02:27:53.720 --> 02:28:01.080]  anyway they're cutting back the trees from the creeks bridges these rest stops
[02:28:01.080 --> 02:28:04.920]  they're cutting down all the trees around them they want to be able to look
[02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:08.960]  down with their surveillance you know no no they admit that in fact I've seen
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:12.560]  articles that sounds crazy but it's true we're like six seven years ago where
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:16.760]  they were clearing areas at national parks and testing little cable systems
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:22.680]  where the robots with cameras buzz along the cable and watch people in Austin's
[02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:27.720]  putting them up in parks an area to make sure you're not dumping trash and there
[02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:31.800]  they're there they're securing police stations cutting trees back putting
[02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:35.440]  barbed wire fences up just like they did a lot of military bases that had been
[02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:39.160]  open bases like Camp Maverick in Austin after 9-11 they're telling them you've
[02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:43.960]  heard the cops call in and I go do they teach you that veterans will attack
[02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:48.160]  your department with IEDs and they go yes we're taught that so they're
[02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:50.920]  teaching them there's going to be a war yeah because they're going to have the
[02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:56.080]  police and military come out and start it with the American people is that not
[02:28:56.080 --> 02:29:05.080]  crazy and also in Ravenna Ohio there's a there's a national guard armory up there
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:11.000]  and within the last two two and a half years they've expanded that they've made
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:16.360]  like four times larger than what it was and a friend of mine told me that they
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:20.800]  said they're getting it ready for the uprising when there's a food shortages
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:26.240]  and all these riots began they're getting the police and again and again the
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:28.720]  government's gonna act like when all this happens that it just happened and
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:32.600]  they just now did this they plan the collapse they'll pose as a savior it is
[02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:37.000]  so diabolical that's why get your food get your guns get ready spread the word
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:41.840]  show that they back off they they could still be made to back off or not have it
[02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:44.960]  as severe if they don't think they're going to be able to properly execute it
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:49.920]  okay but again we've got to wake up out of our trance ladies and gentlemen all

[02:33:28.480 --> 02:33:32.640]  off air I go what's funny and they said it was funny you saw when I was in bed
[02:33:32.640 --> 02:33:39.560]  next to Richard last night and he woke me up yes in a hotel with two beds
[02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:44.560]  ladies and gentlemen I mean my point is is you know we're not super fancy around
[02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:48.360]  here but I guess we probably will just I think his storm was waking me up mom was
[02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:52.560]  waking his up now I was making the point if you just joined us about how when
[02:33:52.560 --> 02:33:55.520]  you're in a hotel room that's where it always happens to me and you hear like
[02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:58.080]  horns honking or something happening you wake up you don't know where you are
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:01.360]  at first you're kind of like in a trance well your brainwaves are at the
[02:34:01.360 --> 02:34:04.240]  same level they are when you're sleepwalking or in between waking and
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:10.160]  sleeping as people's brainwaves are when they have been watching television when
[02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:14.280]  you go into suspended disbelief mode you are in just a highly suggestible
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:18.880]  semi hypnotized mode and the person watches now it's over five hours a day
[02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:22.680]  the average person under the age of 18 it's something like six and a half with
[02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:26.720]  like two hours of video games on top now the internet's not perfect but they
[02:34:26.720 --> 02:34:30.080]  found it's more like reading where it's interactive and makes you think at least
[02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:35.400]  TV is really bad but just to prove to everyone we're here in the hotel room
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:40.320]  Richard Jackson got in the bus this is gonna be really funny here on Skype if
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:45.640]  you're watching at prisonplanet.tv there you go two beds there you go it
[02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:51.800]  wasn't you know like like where the three stooges all in there together that's
[02:34:51.800 --> 02:34:57.440]  hilarious man all right here we go I need to put the camera back up on the
[02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:01.560]  back up on the mount before I lose my Skype connection here you see if I'm
[02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:06.120]  smart enough to do this get this done there we go it's not as good as it was
[02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:10.920]  earlier but I'm trying okay let's try to hurriedly go there's some calls I'm
[02:35:10.920 --> 02:35:15.760]  doing pretty good I'm taking some calls today they go back to my phone here that
[02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:19.120]  I'm getting the callers on what why didn't we launch I am the day so I just
[02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:23.040]  get on that way or is even on these computers I know we have sconded with
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:26.720]  the Chris's company computer we didn't have enough laptops to go on the road
[02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:31.200]  with us oh by the way I'm so busy on the road I'm not even plugging what funds
[02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:35.720]  this operation if you want to go to prisonplanet.tv or infowarsnews.com
[02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:40.280]  it's 15 since a day 5.95 a month one membership is really six memberships
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:43.800]  six people can be logged in simultaneously with the same username and
[02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:47.320]  passcode and I doubt anybody's ever gonna use the same six codes so it's more
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:51.840]  like 15 or 20 memberships I mean I bet if we turned it up to that where you
[02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:54.560]  where you know people could be simultaneously logged in with the
[02:35:54.560 --> 02:35:58.760]  username 15 times you'd start getting people save for the nightly news at
[02:35:58.760 --> 02:36:01.920]  night that's pretty much totally subscriber but you might have people
[02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:06.480]  getting blocked out but six people for 15 cents a day or whatever come in 15
[02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:10.720]  cents a day 5.95 a month there's a 15 day free trial going right now and you
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:15.520]  fund what we're doing also so we can go on the road and our and our old bus I
[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:19.760]  noticed the other talking point was look look he's got a bus he's rich yes
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:25.440]  ladies and gentlemen we had a money bomb and we bought the bus for cheaper than
[02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:29.920]  you can get a new small RV of course I didn't understand the fact that when you
[02:36:29.920 --> 02:36:35.120]  buy a 12 year old well now it's 13 year old I was about it about it six eight
[02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:40.640]  months ago giant bus that you can get them very inexpensively because people
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:45.440]  can't afford the upkeep of it but I love the bus but I'd say it's like a
[02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:50.080]  space shuttle or something now I got an incredible deal on it and I was like wow
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:53.800]  I can't believe I got this for well that's because these buses are different
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:59.840]  and I'm in my style is really not like a topless bar the inside of it does
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:05.880]  look it was actually owned by a famous drag racer and custom car builder that
[02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:09.920]  the IRS was taking everything from so he before they could you know when he was
[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:12.920]  having to liquidate everything he sold it for almost nothing to us about a year
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:18.440]  ago so it was this was a little under a year ago and it I haven't shown it to
[02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:22.560]  people because I really don't want it to being identified it's really just to
[02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:27.800]  get us places with a lot of equipment and crew and so my children can see
[02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:30.720]  America and go on the road with me sometimes they're not on this trip
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:34.640]  which is Bilderberg it's dangerous without weird men with little mustaches
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:37.560]  and potbelly sticking their hands down their pants I mean I just can't put up
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:40.800]  with it I know I'm anti-freedom because I don't want a weirdo you know a
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:44.200]  defrocked priest for child molestation to touch my children I understand that
[02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:48.240]  bad nowadays or not wanting a drone in my backyard or not wanting the NSA run by
[02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:51.280]  foreign banks listening to me and a publicly running al-qaeda but saying I've
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:55.320]  got to get my rights up because of al-qaeda you know so that's what we got
[02:37:55.320 --> 02:37:59.960]  the bus and I want to thank everybody but you can also go to planet info wars
[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:03.120]  calm the social network is exploded people are really getting organized
[02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:05.400]  there there's a lot of coverage a lot of people that are going to be at
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:09.560]  Bilderberg of thousands of activists and freedom lovers are going to be blogging
[02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:16.200]  at planet info wars calm you can also support the sponsors by the books the
[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:19.160]  videos that are available that will help wake you up to a higher level and
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:24.440]  others at prison planet dot TV and has links over to info wars calm the best
[02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:29.480]  place to find the t-shirts the books the ballcabs the films all of it is info
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:35.840]  wars shop calm and that does literally help us put gas because the dollar's
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:41.640]  been devalued in the warwag that I think it's eight miles to the gallon or
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:45.320]  well nine or ten sometimes but if you're going uphill maybe six miles
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:49.760]  still cheaper than flying though you put five or six people on board so the
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:55.880]  point is I do intend to start traveling the country and speaking and to break
[02:38:55.880 --> 02:38:59.360]  even and pay for everything if we speak to about 2,000 people we need to charge
[02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:03.560]  about 20 bucks because the venues are expensive the insurance the security they
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:07.600]  make you get as expensive glenn beck would charge $500 for people to come
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:12.640]  seem and only like 400 or 500 sometimes 200 would come you know I could get 10
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:18.040]  thousand out I've gotten over 2,000 people out before and so but I'm not
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:21.960]  gonna fly around a private jet I could charge two hundred three hundred dollars
[02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:26.560]  a ticket hundreds and hundreds of people would pay it probably thousands and I
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:30.000]  could get a private jet like glenn beck and I'm not knocking him for that he
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:34.440]  wants a private jet to fly around and charge people 500 bucks and do meet and
[02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:38.560]  reach for little kids to come shake his hand I don't do that I see the videos
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:43.000]  of glenn beck with like 15 security people and and people never understand
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:46.960]  or realize they're like he must have hidden security he must be no I I just
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:51.400]  trust in God and I'm not a coward I mean if people not figure that out yet I mean
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:54.920]  I hope this year's last time we pulled over and they drove past us and we
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:58.800]  followed them I hope they have feds or globalists or Marines in plain clothes
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:02.080]  start following us around trying to intimidate us because I'm stopping my
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:07.280]  car and I'm gonna I'm gonna follow you this time okay because I really want to
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:11.000]  know why are you operating illegally inside the US you know full well I'm

[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:25.960]  viruses in the shots this isn't a game okay and it's not about Alex Jones in my
[02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:29.520]  security either this is total war for the heart and soul of humanity in our
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:33.880]  future and the sooner people figure that out and stop being such cowards the
[02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:39.360]  sooner will beat the globalist I'm so sick of it I'm sick of the cowardice and
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:42.640]  I'm sick of the fear and I'm sick of people not being able to realize what
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:46.840]  you're hearing and seeing here is real this is real resistance you're real I'm
[02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:50.760]  real the fights real you do have power that's not a message you get from the
[02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:54.960]  globalist we're real that's why we're under attack so pray for us and support
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:41:00.460]  us last time we were traveling oh I said can we just do the show in the RV

[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:25.240]  famous railway hotels that were out in the West I'll look it up in a minute and
[02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:30.000]  she said you could hear me a hundred yards across and people were like looking
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:33.560]  and asking what was going on but when hotels find out you're doing a radio

[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:41.720]  National Geospatial Agency and he was pretty much talking about how the
[02:42:41.720 --> 02:42:50.480]  National Geospatial Agency has its own Google maps and in advance and that
[02:42:50.480 --> 02:42:55.840]  pretty much made me think of you because you were talking about Google I'm sorry
[02:42:55.840 --> 02:42:59.880]  if I'm a bit nervous you know this I'm not no Google was given a key well your
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:03.800]  dad works for the group that runs the main satellites and is over that highly
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:10.280]  classified and you know the issue here is Google is NSA they were given their
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:16.160]  keyword search that's the basis of Google 12 years ago 13 years ago now that
[02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:21.920]  is the basis it is the NSA it's it's not connected it is and now that's coming
[02:43:21.920 --> 02:43:27.120]  out and yes Google Earth Google Maps all of it is global proprietary taxpayer
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:31.720]  paid for stuff given to private people and their shareholders see they have to
[02:43:31.720 --> 02:43:35.360]  make money while they gang-rape us do you understand that's the important part
[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:40.720]  mm-hmm I'm sorry go ahead and tell us what your dad had to say well he was
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:45.640]  just telling me about his job about what he does he also told me about like the
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:49.560]  networks they have like a hundred gig speed networks that are like really fast
[02:43:49.560 --> 02:43:53.400]  compared to like your home network or an office network yeah they have the
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:58.040]  intranet yeah yeah that way they can watch live time video of you with
[02:43:58.040 --> 02:44:03.960]  ground-penetrating radar have sex with your wife yeah well yeah and by the way
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:10.040]  me myself I am slightly autistic I have Asperger's syndrome so I've been
[02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:16.680]  affected by that too yeah there's going to be some people that due to the
[02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:21.800]  chemical attack are going to end up having unforeseen idiot savant type
[02:44:21.800 --> 02:44:25.040]  characteristics and so there's going to be a lot of curveballs thrown at the
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:27.680]  new world order I'm not saying you're an idiot savant but that's like on the edge
[02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:32.680]  of the entrance of those type areas but I mean I mean does your dad think the
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:37.120]  vaccines did it or is he just think the government loves him well he's kind of
[02:44:37.120 --> 02:44:42.600]  in favor of the government he knows about some of this stuff but he doesn't
[02:44:42.600 --> 02:44:47.160]  really like talking about it he feels like he's on the winning team I mean he
[02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:51.080]  got invited to the party he feels like you he's okay cuz cuz he's got the
[02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:54.840]  inside it'd be like saying oh I know they've got kids in that basement
[02:44:54.840 --> 02:44:58.320]  torturing them but because I know and I'm you know I have dinner with the guy
[02:44:58.320 --> 02:45:05.200]  that does it it's okay well yeah my dad's a good person with church going
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:09.520]  person everything it's just that you know I'm not sure about what else goes on
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:13.840]  you know in the national I'm not saying your dad is bad I was giving an
[02:45:13.840 --> 02:45:18.200]  analogy of the extreme of that but yes people that work for the government are
[02:45:18.200 --> 02:45:22.240]  all compartmentalized and are the most propagandized people ever they're given
[02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:25.280]  all these templates and reasons for what they're doing what they're doing I'm
[02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:28.800]  here to break the compartmentalization so that they at least hear the truth and
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:32.720]  have a choice you know God always does that he works through weak vessels like
[02:45:32.720 --> 02:45:36.200]  myself so that people are warned and have a choice to be told what they're
[02:45:36.200 --> 02:45:41.240]  doing is wrong like abortion is a human you can make excuses all day no it is
[02:45:41.240 --> 02:45:45.560]  that the fact that Marvel Comics has two guys kissing on the cover of it to
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:50.520]  corrupt seven and eight year old kids into sexual activity period is wrong you
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:53.280]  know the fact that you're putting fluoride in our water is giving us cancer
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:57.280]  is wrong you know we see the wages of the new world order they are death the
[02:45:57.280 --> 02:46:01.600]  fruit of the new world order is bondage slow death pain agony
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:06.600]  enslavement disinformation and fraud and I want to turn the train around what
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:11.280]  about you my friend yeah I really want to turn this thing around I also thank
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:15.960]  you for your movies and everything my favorite movie of yours has to be end

[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:32.320]  about it it's only been watched probably 10 million times people are like only
[02:46:32.320 --> 02:46:36.440]  10 million yeah it should be seen about 10 billion times everybody should watch
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:41.560]  it once and then a few more times I know there's only 7 billion 100 million
[02:46:41.560 --> 02:46:45.760]  folks my point is is it needs to be seen this stuff is real it's real and I'm a
[02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:49.080]  normal guy I'm nobody special that's what I'm saying people shouldn't think oh

[02:46:56.400 --> 02:47:00.360]  system of total dehumanization and death and they have public debates about do
[02:47:00.360 --> 02:47:04.160]  they kill 7 billion of us or only 6 billion of us and I'm like hey this is
[02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:08.440]  really bad to the cops the military and so many of them of the if they're the
[02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:12.480]  paramilitary domestic type that have been given that programming they just

[02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:23.560]  we was able to bring it right back up well that's what they do when they put
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:27.840]  a snooping software on is your computer goes down and then when you reboot it
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:32.200]  that's the command for the key loggers and everything else oh so I shouldn't

[02:55:26.840 --> 02:55:33.520]  to pastor in Ohio so you're saying your own family won't tell you about it because
[02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:36.600]  they're in on the winning team I mean is that what I was getting is we went to
[02:55:36.600 --> 02:55:41.120]  break that that this total preparation for war against this all planned the
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:45.160]  total destruction of America in the New World Order and you're saying your own
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:48.560]  family judges and lawyers will not talk to you about it because they're part of
[02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:51.440]  the winning team they're the they're the collaborators or you're saying they're
[02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:55.560]  so freaked out they won't talk about it now it's not that they're freaked out is
[02:55:55.560 --> 02:56:00.240]  because they already know about it and they they are choosing to do nothing and
[02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:04.120]  also when we have our family get together some things whenever we have
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:07.760]  them there are some like some of our kids we have seven children they're all
[02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:11.920]  grown through college and out on their own but the even we have some of them
[02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:15.600]  that are actually catching on because we have showed them proof proof of
[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:20.360]  documents and things like that and they're catching on but like if one of
[02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:23.320]  them will mention like the preppers show and things like that they all get the
[02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:26.840]  laugh and everything and then when I get to talking and start sharing things that
[02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:31.040]  hey look you know everybody should be doing this here we go the media does
[02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:36.040]  that and then picks goofy people to make it look stupid and you know I just feel
[02:56:36.040 --> 02:56:38.840]  sorry for all these people that have no idea I mean folks I've studied history
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:43.120]  we've got the worst case of tyranny growing I've ever seen and if it gets
[02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:47.800]  full grown it's going to make everything in history look tame okay this is total
[02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:51.800]  war this is a total takeover and what are the Romans and others do they when
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:56.000]  they totally took over they would kill everybody the open plan look your
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:01.040]  children are being targeted with this phenol a with lead with mercury with
[02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:05.440]  with with fluoride in the food not just the water with aspartame and all their
[02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:09.840]  candies including the sugar ones they're murdering you they're murdering you
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:15.760]  it's not funny to be a schmuck a sucker an idiot a dupe I can't believe my
[02:57:15.760 --> 02:57:20.240]  country but again they're in trances sir we've got to break them out they're
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:25.920]  under spiritual delusion you understand that well one of the things I wanted to
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:31.800]  tell you was is our town now has and has had now for about a year or a little
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:38.200]  more one of those big black Bradley vehicles they had it on TV one of the
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:43.960]  police and we're retiring and he for his retirement prep I could get by guess
[02:57:43.960 --> 02:57:49.080]  it is they took him for a ride in it but they've been always non they always do
[02:57:49.080 --> 02:57:53.520]  again it's all a script it's always a non-threatening thing let the kids see
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:58.280]  it again think of it as an occupying army I've played declassified army
[02:57:58.280 --> 02:58:03.080]  scyop is type in army scyop film from the 60s it's like from 1961 when they
[02:58:03.080 --> 02:58:09.000]  were helping the endow you know China the French over there and in its
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:13.480]  training films on how they occupy and what they do and scyops they run and
[02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:18.480]  this is it you watch a training film to occupy Vietnam this is what they do now
[02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:21.400]  what's not in the training film is they blow stuff up and blame it on their
[02:58:21.400 --> 02:58:25.400]  enemies and that's a false flag that's in the classified Army manual captains
[02:58:25.400 --> 02:58:28.480]  and above get who are in special ops and again they feel like they're special
[02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:32.680]  because they blow stuff up and I've had army special forces try to set fires
[02:58:32.680 --> 02:58:36.200]  and blame it on me why because I was just trying to cover urban warfare maneuver
[02:58:36.200 --> 02:58:44.120]  in Florida this is the lawlessness of these people thank you for listening to

[03:00:39.920 --> 03:00:46.040]  Our amazing video is up at infowars.com, and it's going mega viral right now.
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:49.720]  Drones shot down over Tejas, and it's our little drones.
[03:00:49.720 --> 03:00:51.240]  We're going to get professional ones out there.
[03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:52.240]  Well, these are semi-professional.
[03:00:52.240 --> 03:00:55.560]  They actually just have better cameras on them than the police systems, and we show
[03:00:55.560 --> 03:00:56.560]  you what this looks like.
[03:00:56.560 --> 03:00:59.240]  We toy with them at first.
[03:00:59.240 --> 03:01:01.440]  So that is up at infowars.com.
[03:01:01.440 --> 03:01:04.160]  This is our protest, our free speech against the drones.
[03:01:04.160 --> 03:01:06.640]  We do not recommend anybody actually shoot real drones down themselves.
[03:01:06.640 --> 03:01:07.640]  We say that in the video.
[03:01:07.640 --> 03:01:08.640]  Shoot them down politically.
[03:01:08.640 --> 03:01:09.640]  Look at this.
[03:01:09.640 --> 03:01:12.160]  I'm going to cover this more in a special video.
[03:01:12.160 --> 03:01:14.280]  We're going to shoot hurtling down the road today.
[03:01:14.280 --> 03:01:21.160]  If we have good internet, it'll be a live stream that we'll do at 4 o'clock today.
[03:01:21.160 --> 03:01:23.360]  How's that for multitasking?
[03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:28.920]  And we've got a Builderburg page that's going to go up and is going to be updated continually.

[03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:02.840]  job and we couldn't do it without them, but continual Builderburg coverage.
[03:02:02.840 --> 03:02:07.960]  I'm going to cover this more coming up in a Builderburg well down because I had a lot
[03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:09.480]  of that news actually.
[03:02:09.480 --> 03:02:11.200]  So much breaking, so much for my sources.
[03:02:11.200 --> 03:02:15.520]  I've got to vet some of it, double vet it before I cover it.
[03:02:15.520 --> 03:02:17.600]  So there'll be a live stream today.
[03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:23.280]  If not, we'll just tape it and upload it and look for that at infowars.com and that will
[03:02:23.280 --> 03:02:25.280]  continually be updated at prismplanet.com.

[03:02:29.760 --> 03:02:33.320]  I want it to be like infowars.com, Ford slash Builderburg.
[03:02:33.320 --> 03:02:36.040]  Is that it?
[03:02:36.040 --> 03:02:39.920]  Because that's going to be fancy because, yeah, it's now.
[03:02:39.920 --> 03:02:40.920]  We're in Virginia.
[03:02:40.920 --> 03:02:41.920]  Yeah.

[03:02:45.560 --> 03:02:47.440]  We'll have a link on there with the Builderburg.
[03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:50.280]  Itinerary, all of it will be right there.
[03:02:50.280 --> 03:02:52.080]  But here it is.
[03:02:52.080 --> 03:02:56.600]  The Economist, the third industrial revolution of 14-page report.
[03:02:56.600 --> 03:02:59.000]  This is basically Nanotech printers.
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:00.160]  They call them 3D printers.
[03:03:00.160 --> 03:03:02.000]  This is how they're going to roll it out.
[03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:05.320]  It'll start very simple, but it's already there and getting very, very complex.
[03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:08.120]  The problem is, talk about a new pollutant.
[03:03:08.120 --> 03:03:10.040]  Nanotech has been found in the brains of most cadavers.
[03:03:10.040 --> 03:03:12.480]  It's already in a lot of manufacturing processes.
[03:03:12.480 --> 03:03:14.640]  It's in food, heavily processed food.
[03:03:14.640 --> 03:03:16.000]  It's a very serious issue.
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:17.600]  We're going to be talking about that.
[03:03:17.600 --> 03:03:19.360]  And I'm going to be talking about this.
[03:03:19.360 --> 03:03:25.320]  Gives from government boosts Bain and other buyout firms, and it goes on to admit the
[03:03:25.320 --> 03:03:30.840]  Democrats are saying, leave Mittens Romney alone.
[03:03:30.840 --> 03:03:32.280]  Leave him alone.
[03:03:32.280 --> 03:03:38.600]  Leave the little darling alone because, well, he's just an angel cake, and all these Democrats
[03:03:38.600 --> 03:03:43.880]  are coming out and saying, leave him alone because they're the folks taking over the
[03:03:43.880 --> 03:03:48.400]  private pension funds and quote, saving them by leveraging them into derivatives.
[03:03:48.400 --> 03:03:52.440]  So everybody's pension, public and private, is tied into fraud because they already stole
[03:03:52.440 --> 03:03:53.440]  them before.
[03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:57.040]  The globalists and the banks did, and government did.
[03:03:57.040 --> 03:03:59.600]  And so they're going to save them by mixing them into the derivatives.
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:03.320]  So everybody's so tied to this fraudulent system that there's no way to pull out.
[03:04:03.320 --> 03:04:06.040]  And then they, then it gets even better.
[03:04:06.040 --> 03:04:12.800]  Then they start bailing all of this out with your tax money and holding everybody hostage.
[03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:19.000]  And that's out of USA Today.
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:20.000]  There you go.
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:30.920]  Infowars.com forward slash Bilderberg 2012.com.
[03:04:30.920 --> 03:04:31.920]  There you go.
[03:04:31.920 --> 03:04:39.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is the actual address for people that want to find all of that out.
[03:04:39.440 --> 03:04:44.720]  And it'll be hot-linked, red-linked up there with our drone video at infowars.com.
[03:04:44.720 --> 03:04:52.400]  All right, more coming up in the transmission worldwide, lasting on an XM-166, AM and FM
[03:04:52.400 --> 03:04:56.760]  dial, global shortwave and internet streams at infowars.com.
[03:04:56.760 --> 03:04:57.760]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:04:57.760 --> 03:04:58.760]  Pray for us.
[03:04:58.760 --> 03:05:11.800]  Thanks for watching through and beyond Bilderberg 2012.
