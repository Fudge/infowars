[00:00.000 --> 00:24.120]  It's a helpless feeling.
[00:24.120 --> 00:29.120]  When your baby is upset and you're uncertain about how to best meet his or her needs, imagine
[00:29.120 --> 00:35.800]  the desperation some moms are feeling seeing these empty shelves if they rely on baby formula.
[00:35.800 --> 00:41.660]  Store after store has little to no baby formula left to buy, or is rationing what they do
[00:41.660 --> 00:43.160]  have left.
[00:43.160 --> 00:48.040]  Even the Atlantic admits this has become a full-blown national crisis.
[00:48.040 --> 00:52.640]  Many states are now at least 40% out of stock according to data assembly.
[00:52.640 --> 00:58.320]  Legacy media is partly blaming the pandemic, but there's also the issue of a major manufacturer,
[00:58.320 --> 01:00.720]  government nutrition, remaining shuttered.
[01:00.720 --> 01:05.320]  The FDA has not let them resume production since a voluntary recall in February of this
[01:05.320 --> 01:06.320]  year.
[01:06.320 --> 01:09.640]  The facility says it will be at least two more months before his formula can fill the
[01:09.640 --> 01:10.800]  shelves again.
[01:10.800 --> 01:15.240]  House Republican Dusty Johnson of South Dakota says that's unacceptable.
[01:15.240 --> 01:19.160]  He's blaming the FDA for dropping the ball and is urging it to do more.
[01:19.160 --> 01:22.400]  Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene is also fired up.
[01:22.400 --> 01:29.760]  40 billion dollars, but there's no baby formula for American mothers and babies.
[01:29.760 --> 01:34.480]  But if you dare even acknowledge this crisis, all these empty shelves, then Democrat Representative
[01:34.480 --> 01:39.400]  Jamie Raskin will say you're just repeating Putin's propaganda and disinformation.
[01:39.400 --> 01:45.800]  Here's a formula for the destruction of democracy, repeating Putin's propaganda and disinformation,
[01:45.800 --> 01:49.480]  and appeasing imperialist assaults on sovereign nations.
[01:49.480 --> 01:54.040]  If this is about claiming that it's about saving lives, let's be real, then we would
[01:54.040 --> 01:59.480]  care about war-torn countries like Ethiopia, so that's a bunch of hypocrisy because I never
[01:59.480 --> 02:01.680]  hear Ethiopia brought up here.
[02:01.680 --> 02:07.840]  So while we've sent more than 54 billion to Ukraine this year, what is being done about
[02:07.840 --> 02:09.560]  these empty shelves?
[02:09.560 --> 02:11.920]  Wait, these shelves look full?
[02:11.920 --> 02:16.280]  Oh, that's a processing center on the U.S. border according to Florida Congresswoman
[02:16.280 --> 02:17.280]  Kat Kamek.
[02:17.280 --> 02:21.560]  What I absolutely have to share with you right now is the craziness of the empty shelves
[02:21.560 --> 02:28.120]  Biden movement and the fact that they are sending pallets, pallets of baby formula to
[02:28.120 --> 02:29.120]  the border.
[02:29.120 --> 02:34.440]  Meanwhile, in our own district at home, we cannot find baby formula.
[02:34.440 --> 02:39.360]  But have no fear, Bill Gates and billionaire crew conveniently have had a backup plan
[02:39.360 --> 02:40.600]  in the works.
[02:40.600 --> 02:45.000]  From a 2020 article in Science Times, Bill Gates, Zuckerberg, other billionaires invest
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.280]  in environmentally friendly, artificial breast milk cultured from human mammary.
[02:50.280 --> 02:52.880]  Oh, hey, isn't that convenient?
[02:52.880 --> 02:56.000]  Dr. Syed Haider has a different take.
[02:56.000 --> 03:02.520]  And so I would recommend don't use the stuff that's available in stores ever again.
[03:02.520 --> 03:09.200]  This is a good time to find a good alternative for your breastfeeding needs or for your child
[03:09.200 --> 03:14.980]  in formula needs because if you read the ingredients on the breast milk in the stores,
[03:14.980 --> 03:18.920]  it's a bunch of junk, honestly, like it's a bunch of oils that I wouldn't recommend
[03:18.920 --> 03:23.040]  that human beings use and a bunch of other sugars.
[03:23.040 --> 03:27.600]  There's a lot of sugar in all the breast or the infant formulas.
[03:27.600 --> 03:31.320]  And so making your own is actually far, far better.
[03:31.320 --> 03:37.200]  Now on cue, this is contrary to what the mainstream media is advising CNN homemade infant formula
[03:37.200 --> 03:42.320]  can be dangerous misinformation about how families can get through infant formula shortage
[03:42.320 --> 03:44.240]  is fueling concern.
[03:44.240 --> 03:48.880]  But the nonprofit Western Price Foundation has been around for more than 20 years, offering
[03:48.880 --> 03:51.960]  an at-home recipe many moms swear by.
[03:51.960 --> 03:54.560]  Other moms are recommending goat's milk as an alternative.
[03:54.560 --> 03:58.080]  So goat milk isn't the perfect substitute for human breast milk.
[03:58.080 --> 04:01.600]  It doesn't have all the same things that human breast milk does, all the same nutrients.
[04:01.600 --> 04:06.880]  There's different levels of different nutrients in the goat milk and in cow milk.
[04:06.880 --> 04:10.760]  So if you want to try to mirror human breast milk as closely as possible, then I would
[04:10.760 --> 04:12.360]  recommend the Western Price formula.
[04:12.360 --> 04:18.160]  You can find that online, just Google Western Price Foundation, you know, baby formula.
[04:18.160 --> 04:21.160]  And it's got a whole lot of stuff and you're not going to have everything on hand.
[04:21.160 --> 04:23.720]  So you're going to have to order some things, you know, it's got all these different oils
[04:23.720 --> 04:26.320]  that you add in and you've got to really mix it up really well.
[04:26.320 --> 04:32.000]  Otherwise, it gives like a recipe of how yeah, they have a recipe and it's kind of complicated.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.800]  So you know, you're going to have to, you're not going to have everything at home, I guarantee
[04:34.800 --> 04:35.800]  you.
[04:35.800 --> 04:39.920]  There's a lot of different like specific oils that you add so that you get the right level
[04:39.920 --> 04:45.240]  of omega-3s and the right level of DHA and EPA and so they're trying to mirror human
[04:45.240 --> 04:49.000]  breast milk as closely as possible and it's really important for brain development to
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.960]  have something that is as close as possible to human breast milk.
[04:52.960 --> 04:57.000]  Perhaps the silver lining in this is that for those that are able to, they'll heed
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.280]  the advice that breast is best.
[05:00.280 --> 05:06.280]  Here at Info Wars, our slogan is, tomorrow's news today, whether it's politics or health

[05:57.120 --> 06:04.120]  Take action now.
[06:28.120 --> 06:33.160]  The world is really starting to wake up to the fact that whether it's Bill Gates or
[06:33.160 --> 06:44.240]  Klaus Schwab or Trudeau up in Canada or Joe Biden and Obama here or Prince Charles, that
[06:44.240 --> 06:50.480]  these people are creepy authoritarian dictators that absolutely hate us and hate our guts
[06:50.480 --> 06:55.280]  and we're going to have to decide whether we're going to allow them to dismantle civilization
[06:55.280 --> 07:02.680]  and deindustrialize us and make us abject poor serfs if we're lucky and live.
[07:02.680 --> 07:10.600]  The direction they're taking us on record is war and famine and death and destruction.
[07:10.600 --> 07:14.680]  And I for one am not going to just sit here and take it.
[07:14.680 --> 07:20.760]  And I want this to sink into the listeners and viewers on this Friday, May 13th broadcast.
[07:20.760 --> 07:28.320]  I guess that's Friday the 13th.
[07:28.320 --> 07:39.320]  This broadcast is the largest, most effective, pro-human, populist resistance platform in
[07:39.320 --> 07:40.320]  the world.
[07:40.320 --> 07:47.240]  And I don't say that with enjoyment because we're ragtag, we're small and we're barely
[07:47.240 --> 07:51.520]  hanging on and we're having a bigger effect than we've ever had.
[07:51.520 --> 07:56.040]  And my enemies are massive.
[07:56.040 --> 08:01.240]  Your enemies are massive, but I know that as their evil plan unfolds, more people will
[08:01.240 --> 08:07.320]  wake up by necessity and realize that we must stop complying with this new world order.
[08:07.320 --> 08:10.880]  It's designed to get us to carry out violence and they think they can win that.
[08:10.880 --> 08:16.160]  They know intellectually long term they're going to lose in a fight with us in a velvet
[08:16.160 --> 08:21.800]  glove approach because what we're promoting is good and wholesome and makes sense and
[08:21.800 --> 08:22.800]  works.
[08:22.800 --> 08:28.040]  What they're promoting is absolutely psychotic and out of control.
[08:28.040 --> 08:31.080]  I mean here's an example, here's several examples.
[08:31.080 --> 08:32.400]  Everything I tell you here's true.
[08:32.400 --> 08:37.880]  Occasionally I make a mistake, but 99% of the time it's dead on.
[08:37.880 --> 08:42.320]  And I told you last year they have a bunch of grand juries open trying to indict myself
[08:42.320 --> 08:45.560]  and Roger Stone and others and now that's in the news that they have these grand juries
[08:45.560 --> 08:51.400]  open on us and that we're quote the main targets for January 6th, even though we try to stop
[08:51.400 --> 08:52.400]  it.
[08:52.400 --> 08:56.000]  Even though Democrats remember we're calling for violence right now.
[08:56.000 --> 08:57.640]  We're calling for peace.
[08:57.640 --> 08:59.480]  They say 1776 means violence.
[08:59.480 --> 09:04.400]  Now it means the answer in 1984 equals 1776, we're in an info war.
[09:04.400 --> 09:06.680]  Info war means information war.
[09:06.680 --> 09:09.200]  The pen is mottier than the sword.
[09:09.200 --> 09:14.360]  But that doesn't get me down knowing that they want to put me in prison.
[09:14.360 --> 09:16.760]  I already know that they're putting us all in prison.
[09:16.760 --> 09:21.040]  What do you think the COVID police state power grab rollout is?
[09:21.040 --> 09:24.320]  But here's another example.
[09:24.320 --> 09:30.720]  I told you that we were really two, three million dollars in the red and that I wouldn't
[09:30.720 --> 09:34.520]  have money to buy the product that funds us into the future if I didn't get two, three
[09:34.520 --> 09:37.680]  million dollars, two million bare minimum.
[09:37.680 --> 09:42.320]  And when I got a million dollar Bitcoin donation, I came on here and I told everybody the media
[09:42.320 --> 09:46.200]  ran articles about it a few days later, like I had been caught with Bitcoin, it was illegal
[09:46.200 --> 09:47.200]  and I was bad.
[09:47.200 --> 09:48.760]  Everything we do, they turn around backwards.
[09:48.760 --> 09:52.560]  Then we got another million dollar donation now worth about 700,000.
[09:52.560 --> 09:54.880]  I'm holding onto it though and hopefully it goes back up.
[09:54.880 --> 09:57.880]  I need all that money to fund our operation.
[09:57.880 --> 10:03.760]  As soon as I told the listeners that we brought in two million dollars, donations and purchases
[10:03.760 --> 10:08.920]  went way down and now we're already about to go back into the red and see I didn't think
[10:08.920 --> 10:09.920]  like a Machiavelli.
[10:09.920 --> 10:14.280]  Oh, if I tell people I've gotten millions of dollars and thank whoever this anonymous
[10:14.280 --> 10:17.360]  donor is, they'll think I don't need help and will stop giving.
[10:17.360 --> 10:18.360]  I don't even think like that.
[10:18.360 --> 10:22.680]  I just tell you the truth about the world and what we're seeing and what's happening
[10:22.680 --> 10:27.040]  and what's going on with us and then I don't think about the consequences with my policy
[10:27.040 --> 10:28.880]  of truth.
[10:28.880 --> 10:32.960]  And overall it's been a good policy in my life and I've gone from being someone that
[10:32.960 --> 10:37.880]  rarely lied to someone that neurotically now tells the truth.
[10:37.880 --> 10:43.600]  And once you start doing that, your brain gets to where it doesn't have to think about
[10:43.600 --> 10:49.760]  stories or backup stories or let me dial this back or let me shade this because it might
[10:49.760 --> 10:51.600]  hurt somebody's feelings or it might hurt me.
[10:51.600 --> 10:59.600]  You just start telling the truth all the time and it is so powerful and so strong.
[10:59.600 --> 11:07.520]  And you conversely compare that to Jen Psaki and this whole show today is about their lies.
[11:07.520 --> 11:13.280]  I've got clips of her saying there is no baby formula shortage even though the FDA admits
[11:13.280 --> 11:18.400]  because of three plants they ordered shut down and supply chain problems that there
[11:18.400 --> 11:21.240]  are massive shortages.
[11:21.240 --> 11:25.600]  She says it's hoarding and that it's your fault when that's not even true.
[11:25.600 --> 11:27.240]  There's no baby formula to hoard.
[11:27.240 --> 11:34.240]  It's sold out everywhere for weeks, months and months waiting list.
[11:34.240 --> 11:36.240]  They also told you last year there was no inflation.
[11:36.240 --> 11:38.440]  Then they told you inflation was good.
[11:38.440 --> 11:44.360]  Now they say the inflation's your fault, the Republicans' fault, populist's fault.
[11:44.360 --> 11:51.080]  And then in the same press conference she says there are no crack pipes being given out to
[11:51.080 --> 11:59.280]  crackheads when they funded over $10 million in the COVID package last year specifically
[11:59.280 --> 12:00.800]  for communities in quote need.
[12:00.800 --> 12:05.760]  I have the bill number, I have the government document, I have the subsection, I have the
[12:05.760 --> 12:09.760]  government website with the damn crack pipes on it.
[12:09.760 --> 12:16.960]  They then say they're not doing it so people go into the welfare centers, they go into
[12:16.960 --> 12:23.320]  the health departments and they're given the stinking federal packages in the stinking
[12:23.320 --> 12:28.760]  federal container telling them it's from the federal government.
[12:28.760 --> 12:34.880]  Now why would Saki, six months after this broke, get up there when somebody asked her
[12:34.880 --> 12:41.000]  about it and say that's a conspiracy theory because they're training you to lie to your
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  face.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.320]  We've got all the big news in Russia and inflation and the borders and the war and
[12:48.320 --> 12:54.160]  so much to cover but just the insulting constant lies.
[12:54.160 --> 12:59.320]  I mean if I lied to you on a routine basis and you caught me, you would not like me and
[12:59.320 --> 13:03.000]  I wouldn't like myself and you would stop listening.
[13:03.000 --> 13:04.360]  And that's the weird paradigm.
[13:04.360 --> 13:07.800]  They don't have listeners, they don't have viewers, Biden has events, a hundred people
[13:07.800 --> 13:19.720]  show up, his wife sells a book, she sells 244 copies but we're told, ladies and gentlemen,
[13:19.720 --> 13:32.160]  we're told that he was elected in this giant landslide and none of that was true.
[13:32.160 --> 13:36.920]  And we know it's not true and then we're told by the FBI, the Justice Department, oh, that's
[13:36.920 --> 13:39.320]  what terrorists do.
[13:39.320 --> 13:45.600]  They put up web graphics on NBC News and ABC News and Fox and see it insane.
[13:45.600 --> 13:47.600]  Here are the signs of being a terrorist.
[13:47.600 --> 13:54.240]  You question lockdowns and inoculation and you question stolen elections.
[13:54.240 --> 13:58.120]  Think about that.
[13:58.120 --> 14:02.520]  So they've always handed out needles to heroin heads and that's probably a good thing because
[14:02.520 --> 14:08.080]  they can give each other HIV by sharing them but the argument that people need fresh, clean
[14:08.080 --> 14:19.160]  crack pipes is preposterous and they're doing it while telling you and myself and the whole
[14:19.160 --> 14:25.920]  world to our face, we're not giving out crack pipes.
[14:25.920 --> 14:30.240]  It's a conspiracy theory, it's like saying it's a conspiracy theory that the Statue
[14:30.240 --> 14:34.200]  of Liberty is off the coast of Manhattan.
[14:34.200 --> 14:37.560]  It's a conspiracy theory that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican.
[14:37.560 --> 14:41.280]  It's a conspiracy that George Washington was our first president.
[14:41.280 --> 14:45.160]  It's a conspiracy theory that Alex Jones is wearing a black shirt, even like if I was
[14:45.160 --> 14:49.520]  on TV right now saying I'm not wearing a black shirt, this is a white shirt and you're sitting
[14:49.520 --> 14:53.600]  there looking at a black shirt going, no, it's not.
[14:53.600 --> 14:58.800]  What is the psychology of that and it's training you to accept lies and just get over it and
[14:58.800 --> 15:00.080]  that they're going to lie to you and that's it.
[15:00.080 --> 15:05.040]  This is behavioral psychology, it's disgusting and how you handle it is totally break with
[15:05.040 --> 15:08.520]  these people and just realize they're the enemy and realize their government's occupied
[15:08.520 --> 15:10.480]  by criminals and realize they're looting us.
[15:10.480 --> 15:14.640]  I mean, my God, folks, inflation's at 11% right now.
[15:14.640 --> 15:18.640]  That's their number.
[15:18.640 --> 15:28.080]  I mean, annual, 11%, it's devastating, devastating and it's accelerating and they're up there
[15:28.080 --> 15:32.960]  making jokes and laughing about it completely out of their minds because this is the scum
[15:32.960 --> 15:36.840]  that black rock and the big banks got that would do traitorous stuff like this to their
[15:36.840 --> 15:40.240]  own families because it'll come back on all these people too.
[15:40.240 --> 15:44.600]  So we've gone over the edge, we're in the collapse and we just cannot have a violent
[15:44.600 --> 15:49.000]  civil war and we cannot let them rope us into that because that's their final coup d'état
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.040]  and we've got to stop a wider war with Russia.
[15:51.040 --> 15:52.040]  We'll talk about it all today.
[15:52.040 --> 15:53.280]  We've got a big broadcast coming up.

[17:07.720 --> 17:12.280]  caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.

[17:56.280 --> 17:57.280]  Thank you so much for your support.
[17:57.280 --> 17:58.280]  Please take action.
[17:58.280 --> 18:06.520]  Over the years, info wars has produced more than 200 amazing patriot americana, second
[18:06.520 --> 18:11.840]  amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts, ball caps, flags, you name it.
[18:11.840 --> 18:15.680]  All of the apparel and the flags are being sold at cost right now.
[18:15.680 --> 18:18.360]  That's just regular plain chain shirts.
[18:18.360 --> 18:23.880]  That is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[18:23.880 --> 18:27.680]  We used to sell for $40, we're selling them for $15, selling them for $20.
[18:27.680 --> 18:32.200]  Over the shirt costs us, if a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5 for us to actually
[18:32.200 --> 18:33.200]  produce.
[18:33.200 --> 18:37.280]  It costs $10, we're selling it for $10 and we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves
[18:37.280 --> 18:38.440]  and we've got short sleeves.
[18:38.440 --> 18:43.080]  We've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all and they're limited edition because
[18:43.080 --> 18:46.040]  we're never going to make any of these designs again.
[18:46.040 --> 18:50.160]  We are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in
[18:50.160 --> 18:51.160]  the future.
[18:51.160 --> 18:55.800]  We've got to sell this to keep m4s on the air plus it spreads the word infowarstore.com
[18:55.800 --> 19:02.080]  with the word awakening, I think what's important that we were on the momentum right now take
[19:02.080 --> 19:05.960]  advantage of this moment and I've always had an idea that something everybody can do with
[19:05.960 --> 19:06.960]  every listener can do.
[19:06.960 --> 19:11.160]  I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to you know, hang the banners over highways
[19:11.160 --> 19:14.960]  imagine a champagne or a pizza that I want you up and you know, it says Alex Jones is
[19:14.960 --> 19:19.240]  right infowarstore.com or we stand with the truckers or rest out or whatever.
[19:19.240 --> 19:21.840]  Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this.
[19:21.840 --> 19:22.840]  Yes.
[19:22.840 --> 19:26.760]  I think it's time in your small town or your big city to write something on math room wall
[19:26.760 --> 19:31.960]  or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain
[19:31.960 --> 19:32.960]  reaction.
[19:32.960 --> 19:34.960]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[19:34.960 --> 19:35.960]  I have a few ideas.
[19:35.960 --> 19:41.520]  First of all, I have just this one small farm, rest out, rest about 12, the vaccine is poison,
[19:41.520 --> 19:42.520]  there's kinds of things.
[19:42.520 --> 19:44.240]  I say just keep it short, keep it concise.
[19:44.240 --> 19:45.240]  Don't agree.
[19:45.240 --> 19:48.600]  Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates, the COVID facts is poison.
[19:48.600 --> 19:49.600]  Beautiful.
[19:49.600 --> 19:50.600]  Yeah.
[19:50.600 --> 19:51.600]  There's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be effective.
[19:51.600 --> 19:53.320]  So that's what I'm calling about.
[19:53.320 --> 19:54.320]  God bless you, Chris.
[19:54.320 --> 19:57.760]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[19:57.760 --> 20:01.360]  Thank you so much.
[20:01.360 --> 20:22.560]  Thank you.
[20:22.560 --> 20:29.560]  Shooter Jennings in the Summer Rage, bringing us in, the info.
[20:29.560 --> 20:37.560]  Chaos is hanging around The tree turned to the ground
[20:37.560 --> 20:44.560]  Shut up from the side The death machine ain't slowing down
[20:44.560 --> 20:49.560]  It's gaining power for power
[20:49.560 --> 20:55.560]  I inspired this song, a gas mask, cause the katoos summer of rage
[20:55.560 --> 20:59.560]  They're building mass graves within states
[20:59.560 --> 21:05.560]  You and I, they're vaccinating They're preparing us for the long haul
[21:05.560 --> 21:06.560]  Police
[21:06.560 --> 21:08.560]  You and I, they're gonna forcibly vaccinate
[21:08.560 --> 21:11.560]  They're preparing us for an all out police state
[21:11.560 --> 21:21.560]  You and I, they're preparing us for an all out police state
[21:21.560 --> 21:33.560]  You and I, they're preparing us for an all out police state
[21:33.560 --> 21:40.560]  The gas mask is the couture of the summer of rage
[21:40.560 --> 21:47.560]  They're building mass graves when they forcibly vaccinate for the police state
[21:47.560 --> 21:51.560]  Now here we are, tomorrow's new day
[21:51.560 --> 21:54.560]  Told you
[21:54.560 --> 22:04.560]  Our only weapons told you to find us Let our love for all neighbors guide us
[22:04.560 --> 22:15.560]  Speak loud when they try to silence With hope when they try to find us
[22:15.560 --> 22:25.560]  There's little time when your love is going wild
[22:25.560 --> 22:32.560]  There's little time, cause our mission's in your hands
[22:32.560 --> 22:34.560]  We are back live
[22:34.560 --> 22:38.560]  Salvation is in your mother's eyes
[22:38.560 --> 22:43.560]  Summer of rage, shooter genics
[22:43.560 --> 22:52.560]  Can't trust nothing but the love in your mother's eyes
[22:52.560 --> 22:54.560]  That's where we are, that was the plan
[22:54.560 --> 22:58.560]  How did I know 12 years ago, how did I inspire shooter genics
[22:58.560 --> 23:03.560]  To have a hit song about the forced inoculation of the takeover
[23:03.560 --> 23:09.560]  Because it's been their damn plan the entire time
[23:09.560 --> 23:16.560]  And I don't want to be here in a few years off air with a total lockdown
[23:16.560 --> 23:20.560]  With everybody saying Alex Jones was right when people are being shipped off to FEMA camps
[23:20.560 --> 23:24.560]  Are you going to let them get to the next point
[23:24.560 --> 23:27.560]  And that's why I'm going to say something before I hit all this news
[23:27.560 --> 23:30.560]  When callers call in, we're going to have open phones again today and I love you to death
[23:30.560 --> 23:34.560]  Please, I thank you, you thank me, we don't need to say it
[23:34.560 --> 23:37.560]  Because I want to explain something
[23:37.560 --> 23:41.560]  What I'm doing is the bare minimum that a loyal, good American
[23:41.560 --> 23:43.560]  But also just a good person would do
[23:43.560 --> 23:49.560]  This is not heroic, this is not amazing
[23:49.560 --> 23:54.560]  This is being informed about a corrupt global cabal that wants to cut our resources off
[23:54.560 --> 23:56.560]  Starves to death and kill us
[23:56.560 --> 24:00.560]  Testing the lockdowns for the real bio attacks that are coming
[24:00.560 --> 24:08.560]  Make the synthetic spike protein bio weapon look like mother's milk in comparison
[24:08.560 --> 24:11.560]  Now I've already prepared to die
[24:11.560 --> 24:13.560]  Not going to commit suicide, love my life
[24:13.560 --> 24:16.560]  What I'm saying is I already know all this is real
[24:16.560 --> 24:18.560]  I'm already prepared
[24:18.560 --> 24:20.560]  I'm already ready
[24:20.560 --> 24:22.560]  You're going to have to get ready
[24:22.560 --> 24:25.560]  And you're going to have to understand they're coming for you
[24:25.560 --> 24:27.560]  They're coming for you
[24:27.560 --> 24:30.560]  And you're not going to get out of this without getting right with God
[24:30.560 --> 24:32.560]  And getting informed and informing others
[24:32.560 --> 24:35.560]  And standing up and saying we know who you are
[24:35.560 --> 24:38.560]  We know you're the enemy, we know you lie
[24:38.560 --> 24:43.560]  And you are going to go to prison
[24:43.560 --> 24:50.560]  Pirates know that we would organize against armies and tanks and planes and missiles
[24:50.560 --> 24:54.560]  But global corporate systems and the media attacking the people
[24:54.560 --> 24:59.560]  With inflation and open borders and poison food and nanotech and bio weapons
[24:59.560 --> 25:01.560]  And cultural poison
[25:01.560 --> 25:04.560]  That, ladies and gentlemen, is how Satan attacks
[25:04.560 --> 25:07.560]  And that is the world you're living in
[25:07.560 --> 25:09.560]  So you can pretend you're a part of the system
[25:09.560 --> 25:12.560]  You can pretend you're going to shut up and not say anything
[25:12.560 --> 25:14.560]  And maybe you'll last a little longer
[25:14.560 --> 25:18.560]  But in the aggregate you are going to destroy yourself and your family
[25:18.560 --> 25:20.560]  And everything that's good and wish to God
[25:20.560 --> 25:24.560]  You've done something not just because of what physically is going to happen to you
[25:24.560 --> 25:29.560]  But because you are going to be so cut off from God and so desperate
[25:29.560 --> 25:34.560]  Because you didn't do the right thing when you had a chance to not just save your ass
[25:34.560 --> 25:38.560]  And not just save other people, but to get inlined with God
[25:38.560 --> 25:42.560]  Get aligned with the truth
[25:42.560 --> 25:45.560]  Nobody's perfect and I'm not judging anybody
[25:45.560 --> 25:48.560]  When I'm up here talking, I'm talking to myself
[25:48.560 --> 25:52.560]  So a lot of folks have noticed I've been more focused and more on target
[25:52.560 --> 25:54.560]  And more serious than I've ever been
[25:54.560 --> 25:59.560]  Because these are serious times, ladies and gentlemen
[25:59.560 --> 26:03.560]  Our government has been fully taken over by absolute criminals
[26:03.560 --> 26:06.560]  There's a handful of people, the state and federal level that are fighting
[26:06.560 --> 26:11.560]  But the horror of what the globalist is doing is so surreal and so scary
[26:11.560 --> 26:16.560]  That DeSantis and Senator Paul and many others like Trump and others
[26:16.560 --> 26:20.560]  And even Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan knows all this
[26:20.560 --> 26:23.560]  They don't think you're ready for the truth
[26:23.560 --> 26:28.560]  And they don't think you can handle the truth as they say in a few good men
[26:28.560 --> 26:32.560]  You want the truth? You can't handle the truth
[26:32.560 --> 26:37.560]  Well, guess what? I do believe you can handle the truth and you're going to get it here
[26:37.560 --> 26:39.560]  So every day we're on air is precious
[26:39.560 --> 26:42.560]  Every broadcast we put out is precious
[26:42.560 --> 26:44.560]  And everything we do is in God's hands
[26:44.560 --> 26:48.560]  But God works through you, that means I am in your hands
[26:48.560 --> 26:50.560]  We are in each other's hands
[26:50.560 --> 26:53.560]  And together we can't be stopped
[26:53.560 --> 26:54.560]  Without each other we're done
[26:54.560 --> 26:58.560]  So I want to salute the listeners that have been with us for decades and years
[26:58.560 --> 27:03.560]  And salute the people that have stood with us and gotten the word out in the Info War
[27:03.560 --> 27:07.560]  And I want to encourage everybody to realize that you better spread the word
[27:07.560 --> 27:09.560]  Like your life depends on it because it does
[27:09.560 --> 27:11.560]  And you better pray for a global awakening
[27:11.560 --> 27:15.560]  And you really should promote hardcore the outlets that tell the truth
[27:15.560 --> 27:17.560]  And there's nowhere like Info Wars
[27:17.560 --> 27:19.560]  And I need your support
[27:19.560 --> 27:20.560]  I don't like treading water
[27:20.560 --> 27:22.560]  Please go to infowarstore.com right at the top
[27:22.560 --> 27:24.560]  You can make a donation

[27:40.560 --> 27:43.560]  The U.S. military uses that we have private labeled
[27:43.560 --> 27:47.560]  And produced 10,000 of
[27:47.560 --> 27:49.560]  In what, 10 different sizes
[27:49.560 --> 27:51.560]  From small phones up to large bags
[27:51.560 --> 27:54.560]  And the whole desktop computers you name it
[27:54.560 --> 27:57.560]  This is so important in the future with the contact tracers and the globalists
[27:57.560 --> 27:59.560]  To get your mind around this
[27:59.560 --> 28:03.560]  And to start keeping these devices in these cages until you use them
[28:03.560 --> 28:05.560]  100% effectiveness
[28:05.560 --> 28:11.560]  Infowarstore.com or AAA 253-3139
[28:11.560 --> 28:14.560]  These are high-end systems at very low prices
[28:14.560 --> 28:16.560]  But whatever you do
[28:16.560 --> 28:19.560]  Take the live links from InfoWars.com.
[28:19.560 --> 28:21.560]  And battleplan.news
[28:21.560 --> 28:24.560]  That's the clone site mirror of Bandai
[28:24.560 --> 28:25.560]  Video takes you to the same links
[28:25.560 --> 28:26.560]  But that's not being blocked now
[28:26.560 --> 28:29.560]  I'm sure soon they'll block that with a new URL
[28:29.560 --> 28:31.560]  But battleplan.news
[28:31.560 --> 28:33.560]  And just continue to realize that
[28:33.560 --> 28:36.560]  Facing the full horror of this is our best hope of stopping it
[28:36.560 --> 28:38.560]  And we will stop it
[28:38.560 --> 28:42.560]  If people wake up to just how premeditated and predatory
[28:42.560 --> 28:45.560]  And focused this attack is
[28:45.560 --> 28:48.560]  And how real and personal it is against you
[28:48.560 --> 28:51.560]  They're coming after me because they want to get to you and you know that
[28:51.560 --> 28:54.560]  We will cover the news when we come back and the number out

[32:17.560 --> 32:19.560]  With all the criminal activity they're involved in
[32:19.560 --> 32:21.560]  It is more important than ever

[34:04.560 --> 34:06.560]  By the way my friends we are back live on this Friday
[34:06.560 --> 34:07.560]  Transmission.
[34:07.560 --> 34:10.560]  Under House Double Showns we're going to have
[34:10.560 --> 34:13.560]  Open phones in the
[34:13.560 --> 34:16.560]  Second and third hour today
[34:16.560 --> 34:19.560]  And again I'm very thankful that you have joined us today
[34:19.560 --> 34:24.560]  So getting back to the ultra massive level of lies
[34:24.560 --> 34:26.560]  That we've all been witnessing
[34:26.560 --> 34:28.560]  And how that's scientifically being done
[34:28.560 --> 34:30.560]  Why that's scientifically being done
[34:30.560 --> 34:34.560]  We need to consciously understand that
[34:34.560 --> 34:36.560]  And understand what the enemy tactic is
[34:36.560 --> 34:38.560]  And I'm going to explain that in a moment
[34:38.560 --> 34:41.560]  Because this is about discrediting the US government
[34:41.560 --> 34:43.560]  It's about discrediting America
[34:43.560 --> 34:45.560]  It's about while they rob us
[34:45.560 --> 34:46.560]  Bringing us down
[34:46.560 --> 34:48.560]  This is a formula
[34:48.560 --> 34:52.560]  So I'm not in defense of government corruption
[34:52.560 --> 34:54.560]  I'm in defense of our republic
[34:54.560 --> 34:55.560]  And I am not anti-government
[34:55.560 --> 35:00.560]  I am anti-globalist occupied US government
[35:00.560 --> 35:02.560]  Let's play some of these outrageous lies
[35:02.560 --> 35:05.560]  Of a press conference yesterday by Jen Psaki
[35:05.560 --> 35:07.560]  Here is Jen Psaki
[35:07.560 --> 35:09.560]  First off
[35:09.560 --> 35:13.560]  Saying that the reason there's a baby formula shortage
[35:13.560 --> 35:15.560]  Is because you're hoarding baby formula
[35:15.560 --> 35:16.560]  Even though the FDA admits
[35:16.560 --> 35:18.560]  They've shut down three of the largest plants
[35:18.560 --> 35:19.560]  There's supply chain problems
[35:19.560 --> 35:21.560]  And there's all sorts of staples that have been running low
[35:21.560 --> 35:23.560]  Or absolutely out all over the US and the world
[35:23.560 --> 35:25.560]  And there's mass starvation in the third world
[35:25.560 --> 35:27.560]  And that's all because of the lockdowns
[35:27.560 --> 35:28.560]  Not from COVID
[35:28.560 --> 35:30.560]  But from the lockdowns they've put in place
[35:30.560 --> 35:31.560]  That were designed to do this
[35:31.560 --> 35:32.560]  You'll own nothing
[35:32.560 --> 35:33.560]  You'll have nothing
[35:33.560 --> 35:35.560]  And you'll like it because you're going to be dead
[35:35.560 --> 35:36.560]  And you'll have no free will
[35:36.560 --> 35:37.560]  And you'll have no privacy
[35:37.560 --> 35:40.560]  Those are all official statements by the Davos Group
[35:40.560 --> 35:41.560]  I can play the clips
[35:41.560 --> 35:43.560]  I've already played them probably a hundred times
[35:43.560 --> 35:44.560]  You're like again
[35:44.560 --> 35:46.560]  Why do they lie on one hand
[35:46.560 --> 35:47.560]  Then rub our noses in it and the other
[35:47.560 --> 35:49.560]  I'll explain the psychology in a moment
[35:49.560 --> 35:50.560]  You can give it technical terms
[35:50.560 --> 35:53.560]  But I'm going to give you the Alex Jones street view
[35:53.560 --> 35:55.560]  Now
[35:55.560 --> 35:56.560]  Here's Saki
[35:56.560 --> 35:58.560]  But if you are a parent
[35:58.560 --> 35:59.560]  Who's looking for formula right now
[35:59.560 --> 36:01.560]  Struggling to find what you need
[36:01.560 --> 36:03.560]  You have even a rough guess of how long
[36:03.560 --> 36:05.560]  These shortages are going to last
[36:05.560 --> 36:07.560]  What should parents be bracing for here?
[36:07.560 --> 36:09.560]  Well we've already seen an increase in supply
[36:09.560 --> 36:10.560]  Over the past couple of weeks
[36:10.560 --> 36:12.560]  What we are seeing which is an enormous problem
[36:12.560 --> 36:13.560]  Is hoarding
[36:13.560 --> 36:15.560]  People hoarding because they're fearful
[36:15.560 --> 36:17.560]  That is one element of it
[36:17.560 --> 36:19.560]  And people hoarding because they are trying to profit
[36:19.560 --> 36:21.560]  Off of fearful parents
[36:21.560 --> 36:23.560]  So that is also something we're focused on
[36:25.560 --> 36:28.560]  So you're hoarding maybe formula
[36:28.560 --> 36:29.560]  No this is not like the toilet paper
[36:29.560 --> 36:31.560]  They're shortages
[36:31.560 --> 36:32.560]  And by the way
[36:32.560 --> 36:34.560]  The aunt saved stuff in the summer
[36:34.560 --> 36:35.560]  And lived in the winter
[36:35.560 --> 36:36.560]  The grasshoppers don't
[36:36.560 --> 36:38.560]  All of our ancestors up until 50 years ago
[36:38.560 --> 36:40.560]  Did have a year supply of food
[36:40.560 --> 36:41.560]  That's what you're supposed to do
[36:41.560 --> 36:42.560]  Unless you're an idiot
[36:42.560 --> 36:44.560]  But they train you to have nothing
[36:44.560 --> 36:45.560]  So they can control you
[36:45.560 --> 36:46.560]  Now it gets worse
[36:46.560 --> 36:48.560]  Here she is expanding on the gaslighting
[36:48.560 --> 36:50.560]  Here's Saki saying
[36:50.560 --> 36:53.560]  That if parents can't buy baby formula
[36:53.560 --> 36:55.560]  Call a doctor
[36:55.560 --> 36:58.560]  As if a doctor
[36:58.560 --> 36:59.560]  Is going to then have
[36:59.560 --> 37:01.560]  All this baby formula for you
[37:01.560 --> 37:03.560]  I mean just the
[37:03.560 --> 37:05.560]  Let the meat cake
[37:05.560 --> 37:08.560]  Nature of this
[37:08.560 --> 37:10.560]  Is just
[37:10.560 --> 37:13.560]  Again so in your face
[37:13.560 --> 37:15.560]  Insult
[37:15.560 --> 37:16.560]  Here she is
[37:16.560 --> 37:18.560]  Since you said it was a public health question
[37:18.560 --> 37:20.560]  Which agency should that question be directed to
[37:20.560 --> 37:22.560]  Just the very practical
[37:22.560 --> 37:23.560]  Immediate question of
[37:23.560 --> 37:24.560]  If you can't find formula
[37:24.560 --> 37:26.560]  And you need it for your baby to eat
[37:26.560 --> 37:28.560]  What should baby do?
[37:28.560 --> 37:30.560]  We would certainly encourage any parent
[37:30.560 --> 37:32.560]  Who has concerns about their child's health
[37:32.560 --> 37:34.560]  Or well-being to call their doctor
[37:34.560 --> 37:36.560]  Or pediatrician
[37:36.560 --> 37:38.560]  But
[37:38.560 --> 37:40.560]  Now she just said
[37:40.560 --> 37:42.560]  That you should just go to your doctor
[37:42.560 --> 37:43.560]  She just said they're hoarding it
[37:43.560 --> 37:45.560]  There's not really a supply problem
[37:45.560 --> 37:47.560]  But then she admits
[37:47.560 --> 37:48.560]  That there's been a problem
[37:48.560 --> 37:49.560]  That's clip seven
[37:49.560 --> 37:51.560]  And says they've been working on it for months
[37:51.560 --> 37:53.560]  So the problem doesn't exist
[37:53.560 --> 37:55.560]  But it's your fault because you're hoarding
[37:55.560 --> 37:56.560]  But they've been working on the problem
[37:56.560 --> 37:57.560]  For months
[37:57.560 --> 37:58.560]  Here she is
[37:58.560 --> 38:00.560]  President Biden has directed the administration
[38:00.560 --> 38:02.560]  To work urgently to ensure
[38:02.560 --> 38:04.560]  That infant formula is safe
[38:04.560 --> 38:06.560]  And available for families across the country
[38:06.560 --> 38:09.560]  During the Abbott Nutrition Voluntary Recall
[38:09.560 --> 38:11.560]  This is work that's been underway
[38:11.560 --> 38:12.560]  For months
[38:12.560 --> 38:14.560]  Okay, so just 12 months ago
[38:14.560 --> 38:16.560]  There is no inflation
[38:16.560 --> 38:17.560]  Then inflation's light
[38:17.560 --> 38:18.560]  And it's good for you
[38:18.560 --> 38:20.560]  And now, okay, there's inflation
[38:20.560 --> 38:21.560]  It's your fault
[38:21.560 --> 38:23.560]  It's the Republicans fault
[38:23.560 --> 38:24.560]  And the fuel's up
[38:24.560 --> 38:26.560]  Because he shut down all the pipelines
[38:26.560 --> 38:30.560]  And killed basically all of the permits
[38:30.560 --> 38:32.560]  But that's okay
[38:32.560 --> 38:34.560]  Because we're in a transition
[38:34.560 --> 38:36.560]  But there's no fuel shortage
[38:36.560 --> 38:37.560]  But it's good for you
[38:37.560 --> 38:39.560]  You need to learn to not drive too much
[38:39.560 --> 38:41.560]  See?
[38:41.560 --> 38:43.560]  They write up all these lies
[38:43.560 --> 38:44.560]  And all these answers
[38:44.560 --> 38:45.560]  And then don't even care
[38:45.560 --> 38:47.560]  If they don't match up logically
[38:47.560 --> 38:48.560]  Because they're training you
[38:48.560 --> 38:50.560]  On a diet of garbage
[38:50.560 --> 38:52.560]  To make you lose confidence
[38:52.560 --> 38:54.560]  That's what lockdowns were about
[38:54.560 --> 38:55.560]  So you wouldn't work anymore
[38:55.560 --> 38:57.560]  That's what all the fear is about
[38:57.560 --> 38:58.560]  It's what all the third world populations
[38:58.560 --> 38:59.560]  That are desperate being brought in
[38:59.560 --> 39:01.560]  Is about collapse
[39:01.560 --> 39:03.560]  Cloward and Piven, the Democratic Party Plan
[39:03.560 --> 39:05.560]  Developed by Communist professors
[39:05.560 --> 39:07.560]  To undermine the U.S.
[39:07.560 --> 39:08.560]  And to cut off resources
[39:08.560 --> 39:09.560]  And to collapse it
[39:09.560 --> 39:12.560]  To then bring in their new system
[39:12.560 --> 39:13.560]  And under that same plan
[39:13.560 --> 39:14.560]  50 million Americans
[39:14.560 --> 39:16.560]  That was back when we were 200 million Americans
[39:16.560 --> 39:18.560]  Now it would be like 100 million
[39:18.560 --> 39:19.560]  They want to put in camps
[39:19.560 --> 39:21.560]  And they asked to make a lot to kill
[39:21.560 --> 39:22.560]  Half of us in those camps
[39:22.560 --> 39:24.560]  That came out in federal trials
[39:24.560 --> 39:26.560]  With the weathermen that directly advised
[39:26.560 --> 39:29.560]  Barack Hussein Obama
[39:29.560 --> 39:32.560]  That comes out of Columbia University
[39:32.560 --> 39:33.560]  I'm not going to go play the clips
[39:33.560 --> 39:34.560]  Or the witnesses
[39:34.560 --> 39:35.560]  Or all of you can find it if you want
[39:35.560 --> 39:36.560]  You know what?
[39:36.560 --> 39:38.560]  Get Harry Groft John
[39:38.560 --> 39:39.560]  The Green Beret
[39:39.560 --> 39:40.560]  That they tried to hire
[39:40.560 --> 39:41.560]  That infiltrated him
[39:41.560 --> 39:43.560]  And got all the recordings
[39:43.560 --> 39:44.560]  I'll get that clip of Groft John
[39:44.560 --> 39:45.560]  Talking about the plan
[39:45.560 --> 39:49.560]  To kill 25 million people in death camps
[39:49.560 --> 39:51.560]  And they got the documents too
[39:51.560 --> 39:52.560]  So that's the type of people
[39:52.560 --> 39:53.560]  That we're dealing with
[39:53.560 --> 39:57.560]  Here is shocky
[39:57.560 --> 39:59.560]  With more gaslighting
[39:59.560 --> 40:01.560]  More intense flying
[40:01.560 --> 40:02.560]  Here she is saying
[40:02.560 --> 40:04.560]  That it's a conspiracy theory
[40:04.560 --> 40:06.560]  There are no crackpipes
[40:06.560 --> 40:08.560]  Being mailed out by the federal government
[40:08.560 --> 40:09.560]  Even though we have the bill
[40:09.560 --> 40:11.560]  The legislation that passed last year
[40:11.560 --> 40:12.560]  The 10 million dollars for it
[40:12.560 --> 40:14.560]  And all that I'm about to show you
[40:14.560 --> 40:16.560]  But see we show you this stuff
[40:16.560 --> 40:18.560]  She just says it's a lie
[40:18.560 --> 40:19.560]  Even though they defended it
[40:19.560 --> 40:20.560]  Six months ago
[40:20.560 --> 40:24.560]  Here she is
[40:24.560 --> 40:25.560]  This policy does not allow
[40:25.560 --> 40:27.560]  For crackpipes to be included
[40:27.560 --> 40:28.560]  I would just note that
[40:28.560 --> 40:30.560]  This is a bit of a conspiracy theory
[40:30.560 --> 40:31.560]  That's been spread out there
[40:31.560 --> 40:33.560]  It's not accurate
[40:33.560 --> 40:35.560]  It's a bit of a conspiracy
[40:35.560 --> 40:37.560]  How much of a bit is it?
[40:37.560 --> 40:39.560]  Okay overhead shot please
[40:39.560 --> 40:40.560]  Here's just our little
[40:40.560 --> 40:42.560]  Free government crackpipe file
[40:42.560 --> 40:43.560]  Took us about five minutes
[40:43.560 --> 40:44.560]  To pull all this up
[40:44.560 --> 40:45.560]  And all these articles have links to it
[40:45.560 --> 40:47.560]  Free crackpipes obtained
[40:47.560 --> 40:48.560]  And an investigation
[40:48.560 --> 40:49.560]  The government funded
[40:49.560 --> 40:50.560]  Safe smoking kits
[40:50.560 --> 40:51.560]  Congress has obtained them
[40:51.560 --> 40:52.560]  You go to health departments
[40:52.560 --> 40:53.560]  And get them
[40:53.560 --> 40:54.560]  It says the federal government
[40:54.560 --> 40:55.560]  For them
[40:55.560 --> 40:56.560]  And we've got them all
[40:56.560 --> 40:57.560]  Over the country
[40:57.560 --> 40:58.560]  From Virginia
[40:58.560 --> 40:59.560]  New York
[40:59.560 --> 41:00.560]  You name it
[41:00.560 --> 41:01.560]  That's where they're getting them
[41:01.560 --> 41:02.560]  Revealed by the administration
[41:02.560 --> 41:04.560]  Safe smoking kits
[41:04.560 --> 41:05.560]  Include crackpipes
[41:05.560 --> 41:08.560]  Other drug paraphernalia
[41:08.560 --> 41:09.560]  Free beacon confirms
[41:09.560 --> 41:10.560]  Safe smoking kits
[41:10.560 --> 41:11.560]  Include free crackpipes
[41:11.560 --> 41:13.560]  So by them denying it
[41:13.560 --> 41:14.560]  We have a debate about
[41:14.560 --> 41:15.560]  Whether or not it's happening
[41:15.560 --> 41:17.560]  Instead of telling them to stop
[41:17.560 --> 41:18.560]  And that's the tactic
[41:18.560 --> 41:19.560]  When you've got a piece
[41:19.560 --> 41:20.560]  Of legislation that passed
[41:20.560 --> 41:21.560]  With the funding
[41:21.560 --> 41:22.560]  And the millions of crackpipes
[41:22.560 --> 41:24.560]  Being mowed out, it's millions
[41:24.560 --> 41:26.560]  And then when people complain
[41:26.560 --> 41:27.560]  About it
[41:27.560 --> 41:28.560]  You just say it doesn't exist
[41:28.560 --> 41:29.560]  So you didn't have a debate
[41:29.560 --> 41:30.560]  About whether it exists or not
[41:30.560 --> 41:31.560]  Like, hey, I don't want the
[41:31.560 --> 41:32.560]  Davos group to run my health
[41:32.560 --> 41:33.560]  Care through the U.N.
[41:33.560 --> 41:34.560]  They signed an agreement last
[41:34.560 --> 41:35.560]  Week
[41:35.560 --> 41:36.560]  They've got a secret treaty
[41:36.560 --> 41:37.560]  They admit it takes full control
[41:37.560 --> 41:38.560]  Of all the health departments
[41:38.560 --> 41:39.560]  And all the federal
[41:39.560 --> 41:41.560]  Government responses
[41:41.560 --> 41:43.560]  Of 196 countries
[41:43.560 --> 41:44.560]  Their response is
[41:44.560 --> 41:45.560]  Doesn't exist
[41:46.560 --> 41:47.560]  Bilderberg Group
[41:47.560 --> 41:48.560]  We don't want the Bilderberg Group
[41:48.560 --> 41:49.560]  Running things
[41:49.560 --> 41:50.560]  Doesn't exist
[41:50.560 --> 41:52.560]  And then you just have a debate
[41:52.560 --> 41:54.560]  About whether it exists or not
[41:54.560 --> 41:56.560]  And then I can show you
[41:57.560 --> 41:59.560]  Some of the legislation right here
[42:00.560 --> 42:02.560]  This is the Fiscal Year 2022
[42:02.560 --> 42:04.560]  Harm Reduction Program
[42:04.560 --> 42:06.560]  Funded by the Department of Health
[42:06.560 --> 42:07.560]  And Human Services
[42:07.560 --> 42:09.560]  With money from the
[42:09.560 --> 42:12.560]  Second COVID bailout last year
[42:12.560 --> 42:13.560]  Department of Health and Human
[42:13.560 --> 42:14.560]  Services Substance Abuse
[42:14.560 --> 42:15.560]  And Mental Health Services
[42:15.560 --> 42:16.560]  Administration
[42:16.560 --> 42:18.560]  Harm Reduction Program
[42:18.560 --> 42:19.560]  And then here it is right here
[42:19.560 --> 42:20.560]  Page 8
[42:20.560 --> 42:22.560]  With the crack pipes
[42:22.560 --> 42:24.560]  And then it lists the legislation
[42:24.560 --> 42:25.560]  That funded it
[42:25.560 --> 42:27.560]  But again, ladies and gentlemen
[42:27.560 --> 42:28.560]  It does
[42:28.560 --> 42:29.560]  Not
[42:29.560 --> 42:30.560]  Exist
[42:30.560 --> 42:31.560]  Because
[42:31.560 --> 42:32.560]  Saki
[42:32.560 --> 42:33.560]  Just

[42:35.560 --> 42:36.560]  See how that works?

[45:51.560 --> 45:52.560]  From InfoWars life today
[45:59.560 --> 46:00.560]  I designed over
[46:00.560 --> 46:01.560]  200 t-shirts
[46:01.560 --> 46:02.560]  The last 25 years
[46:02.560 --> 46:03.560]  And we have some of those
[46:03.560 --> 46:04.560]  Original designs
[46:04.560 --> 46:05.560]  Still for sale
[46:05.560 --> 46:06.560]  At infowarsstore.com
[46:06.560 --> 46:08.560]  These are real classics
[46:08.560 --> 46:09.560]  Ladies and gentlemen
[46:09.560 --> 46:10.560]  They're all about to be
[46:10.560 --> 46:11.560]  Limited edition
[46:11.560 --> 46:12.560]  Because we're selling
[46:12.560 --> 46:13.560]  Out of them
[46:13.560 --> 46:14.560]  They're about to be history
[46:14.560 --> 46:15.560]  And we're selling out of
[46:15.560 --> 46:16.560]  The hoodies
[46:16.560 --> 46:17.560]  The ball caps
[46:17.560 --> 46:18.560]  The t-shirts
[46:18.560 --> 46:19.560]  All these amazing designs
[46:19.560 --> 46:21.560]  At costinfowarsstore.com
[46:21.560 --> 46:23.560]  Except for this fundraiser shirt
[46:23.560 --> 46:24.560]  That is a real hit
[46:24.560 --> 46:25.560]  And people love it
[46:25.560 --> 46:26.560]  It's $24.95
[46:26.560 --> 46:27.560]  Alex Jones is right on the front
[46:27.560 --> 46:28.560]  The Red Thunderbolt
[46:28.560 --> 46:29.560]  And then again
[46:29.560 --> 46:30.560]  On the back
[46:30.560 --> 46:31.560]  A big, bold
[46:31.560 --> 46:32.560]  InfoWars.com
[46:32.560 --> 46:33.560]  Exercise your first amendment
[46:33.560 --> 46:34.560]  Don't let the leftist
[46:34.560 --> 46:35.560]  And the globalist
[46:35.560 --> 46:36.560]  Bully silence you
[46:36.560 --> 46:38.560]  And fund the InfoWars
[46:38.560 --> 46:39.560]  At the same time
[46:39.560 --> 46:40.560]  There is not a more
[46:40.560 --> 46:41.560]  Politically incorrect shirt
[46:41.560 --> 46:43.560]  That sends a stronger message
[46:43.560 --> 46:44.560]  Of freedom resistance
[46:44.560 --> 46:45.560]  To the New World Order
[46:45.560 --> 46:46.560]  Than the Alex Jones
[46:46.560 --> 46:47.560]  Was right shirt
[46:47.560 --> 46:48.560]  Exclusively available
[46:48.560 --> 46:49.560]  At infowarsstore.com
[46:49.560 --> 46:50.560]  And again
[46:50.560 --> 46:51.560]  This shirt is
[46:51.560 --> 46:52.560]  Limited edition as well
[46:52.560 --> 46:53.560]  We're doing one more run
[46:53.560 --> 46:54.560]  And then no more
[46:54.560 --> 46:56.560]  InfoWarsstore.com
[46:56.560 --> 47:09.560]  Get yours today.
[47:26.560 --> 47:33.560]  All right, it's not bragging
[47:33.560 --> 47:35.560]  Believe me, we're a major target
[47:35.560 --> 47:36.560]  The target
[47:36.560 --> 47:37.560]  But it's true
[47:37.560 --> 47:40.560]  We are the main resistance
[47:40.560 --> 47:42.560]  We have the enemy plan
[47:42.560 --> 47:44.560]  You know their operations
[47:44.560 --> 47:45.560]  We know how to stop them
[47:45.560 --> 47:46.560]  And we're here
[47:46.560 --> 47:47.560]  Swingin' for the fences
[47:47.560 --> 47:49.560]  And prayin' to God
[47:49.560 --> 47:50.560]  To direct us
[47:50.560 --> 47:51.560]  And give us victory
[47:51.560 --> 47:55.560]  The answer to the New World Order
[47:55.560 --> 48:00.560]  Is everybody becoming awake
[48:00.560 --> 48:02.560]  And I guess you could say
[48:02.560 --> 48:03.560]  We're all Alex Jones
[48:03.560 --> 48:04.560]  We're all Spartacus
[48:04.560 --> 48:10.560]  And the good news is
[48:10.560 --> 48:11.560]  Not just here in the U.S.
[48:11.560 --> 48:12.560]  But all over the world
[48:12.560 --> 48:14.560]  There are Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan types
[48:14.560 --> 48:15.560]  Many of which
[48:15.560 --> 48:17.560]  Believed in the system previously
[48:17.560 --> 48:19.560]  But now know it's predatory
[48:19.560 --> 48:20.560]  And coming after everybody
[48:20.560 --> 48:23.560]  And they are now telling their giant audiences
[48:23.560 --> 48:24.560]  That we're dealing with
[48:24.560 --> 48:25.560]  Creepy evil dictators
[48:25.560 --> 48:26.560]  That are our enemies
[48:26.560 --> 48:28.560]  And it's just a fact
[48:28.560 --> 48:30.560]  And if we can't address this plan
[48:30.560 --> 48:31.560]  This Bilderberg group
[48:31.560 --> 48:32.560]  Davos plan
[48:32.560 --> 48:33.560]  That Davos is the Bilderberg group
[48:33.560 --> 48:34.560]  It's public arm
[48:34.560 --> 48:36.560]  Then we have no future
[48:36.560 --> 48:37.560]  And I could cover
[48:37.560 --> 48:38.560]  Again, I've already covered some news
[48:38.560 --> 48:39.560]  But I could cover news all day
[48:39.560 --> 48:40.560]  And I am going to cover the latest
[48:40.560 --> 48:41.560]  In Ukraine in a moment
[48:41.560 --> 48:42.560]  The economy
[48:42.560 --> 48:45.560]  But it's this understanding
[48:45.560 --> 48:46.560]  That's everything
[48:46.560 --> 48:47.560]  That you're not at a football game
[48:47.560 --> 48:49.560]  Where it doesn't matter who wins
[48:49.560 --> 48:50.560]  This is life and death
[48:50.560 --> 48:52.560]  And these people see you as the enemy
[48:52.560 --> 48:54.560]  Because you're eating food
[48:54.560 --> 48:55.560]  And taking resources
[48:55.560 --> 48:56.560]  That they believe is theirs
[48:56.560 --> 48:58.560]  Because they took the planet over
[48:58.560 --> 48:59.560]  Through fractional reserve banking
[48:59.560 --> 49:01.560]  And derivatives and fraud
[49:01.560 --> 49:03.560]  And instead of going to prison
[49:03.560 --> 49:05.560]  They plan to crash the whole system
[49:05.560 --> 49:06.560]  Take everything over
[49:06.560 --> 49:07.560]  Vertically integrate things
[49:07.560 --> 49:09.560]  And make you as poor as possible
[49:09.560 --> 49:11.560]  To then, with a social credit score
[49:11.560 --> 49:12.560]  And universal basic income
[49:12.560 --> 49:14.560]  After they've made us obsolete
[49:14.560 --> 49:18.560]  Sign on to slow death
[49:18.560 --> 49:19.560]  So this is happening
[49:19.560 --> 49:22.560]  And there's nothing more positive
[49:22.560 --> 49:23.560]  When you've got a broken leg
[49:23.560 --> 49:24.560]  And a compound fracture
[49:24.560 --> 49:25.560]  And your bone sticking out
[49:25.560 --> 49:26.560]  The side of your leg
[49:26.560 --> 49:28.560]  To admit you've got a broken leg
[49:28.560 --> 49:30.560]  And to go get the damn thing fixed
[49:30.560 --> 49:31.560]  But we're sitting here
[49:31.560 --> 49:33.560]  With bullet holes in us
[49:33.560 --> 49:34.560]  Bleeding to death
[49:34.560 --> 49:37.560]  And if we can't admit that we got shot
[49:37.560 --> 49:39.560]  And if we can't admit that we're in trouble
[49:39.560 --> 49:41.560]  And if we can't admit the people that did it
[49:41.560 --> 49:42.560]  Are getting ready to chop our head off
[49:42.560 --> 49:43.560]  And finish the job
[49:43.560 --> 49:45.560]  Well, then we're done
[49:45.560 --> 49:47.560]  You've got to get out of your comfort zone
[49:47.560 --> 49:49.560]  You've got to get into survival mode
[49:49.560 --> 49:51.560]  You've got to get into resistance mode
[49:51.560 --> 49:53.560]  You've got to get into the life force
[49:53.560 --> 49:56.560]  You've got to get into the will to survive
[49:56.560 --> 49:58.560]  And thrive and have victory
[50:02.560 --> 50:05.560]  We need to join wills
[50:05.560 --> 50:07.560]  Before God together right now
[50:07.560 --> 50:09.560]  Pray with me
[50:09.560 --> 50:10.560]  Our Heavenly Father
[50:10.560 --> 50:12.560]  We come before you meekly
[50:12.560 --> 50:14.560]  And repent for all of our sins
[50:14.560 --> 50:15.560]  And know that our best works
[50:15.560 --> 50:17.560]  Have a dirty rags before you
[50:17.560 --> 50:20.560]  And your complete absolute perfection
[50:20.560 --> 50:22.560]  We thank you for the gift of consciousness
[50:22.560 --> 50:24.560]  And free will
[50:24.560 --> 50:26.560]  And we ask you to enter our souls
[50:26.560 --> 50:28.560]  And to cleanse us of the evil
[50:28.560 --> 50:30.560]  And to set us upright
[50:30.560 --> 50:33.560]  And help us be engines in vessels of truth and justice
[50:33.560 --> 50:35.560]  To stand against the wickedness
[50:35.560 --> 50:36.560]  That is coming against our children
[50:36.560 --> 50:37.560]  Our very genetic code
[50:37.560 --> 50:39.560]  In the future of our species
[50:39.560 --> 50:42.560]  We humbly ask you to intersect now
[50:42.560 --> 50:43.560]  Via free will
[50:43.560 --> 50:44.560]  And to come into our hearts and souls
[50:44.560 --> 50:45.560]  Together
[50:45.560 --> 50:46.560]  And as a community
[50:46.560 --> 50:47.560]  Make us strong
[50:47.560 --> 50:49.560]  And give us the vision
[50:49.560 --> 50:51.560]  And to lead God and direct us
[50:51.560 --> 50:53.560]  To the important work we must do
[50:53.560 --> 50:55.560]  And to give us the courage
[50:55.560 --> 50:56.560]  And the commitment
[50:56.560 --> 50:59.560]  And the focus to carry out this task
[50:59.560 --> 51:03.560]  In the name of your great sacrifice
[51:03.560 --> 51:05.560]  Of your son Jesus Christ
[51:05.560 --> 51:07.560]  Amen
[51:09.560 --> 51:13.560]  I'm asking all of you to join wills with me now
[51:13.560 --> 51:14.560]  Your will is strong
[51:14.560 --> 51:15.560]  Your will is old
[51:15.560 --> 51:18.560]  Your lineage is powerful
[51:18.560 --> 51:19.560]  They fear you
[51:19.560 --> 51:21.560]  And they fear what we're going to do together
[51:21.560 --> 51:24.560]  We are only in our larval stage right now
[51:24.560 --> 51:27.560]  We are only like the caterpillar
[51:27.560 --> 51:29.560]  That is now going into the chrysalis
[51:29.560 --> 51:31.560]  To become the butterfly
[51:31.560 --> 51:34.560]  The journey has just begun
[51:34.560 --> 51:36.560]  But we must recognize it
[51:36.560 --> 51:38.560]  And we must come together
[51:38.560 --> 51:41.560]  We must join forces
[51:41.560 --> 51:43.560]  We must do it before God
[51:43.560 --> 51:46.560]  We must commit and sign on
[51:46.560 --> 51:48.560]  To the resistance of Satan
[51:48.560 --> 51:51.560]  And obedience to God
[51:51.560 --> 51:55.560]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God
[51:55.560 --> 51:57.560]  So said Thomas Jefferson
[51:57.560 --> 51:59.560]  And Jefferson also said
[51:59.560 --> 52:02.560]  I have sworn on the altar of God
[52:02.560 --> 52:07.560]  Eternal resistance over every form of tyranny
[52:07.560 --> 52:11.560]  That attacks the mind of man
[52:11.560 --> 52:14.560]  It was Mark Twain
[52:14.560 --> 52:18.560]  The great intellectual that said
[52:18.560 --> 52:22.560]  In the beginning a patriot is a scarce man
[52:22.560 --> 52:25.560]  Hated, feared, and scorned
[52:25.560 --> 52:28.560]  But in time his cause succeeds
[52:31.560 --> 52:34.560]  The timid join him
[52:34.560 --> 52:39.560]  Because then it cost nothing
[52:39.560 --> 52:42.560]  To be a patriot
[52:42.560 --> 52:45.560]  In the beginning a patriot is a scarce man
[52:45.560 --> 52:47.560]  Hated, feared, and scorned
[52:47.560 --> 52:50.560]  But in time
[52:50.560 --> 52:53.560]  When his cause succeeds
[52:53.560 --> 52:55.560]  The timid join him
[52:55.560 --> 52:58.560]  Because then it cost nothing
[52:58.560 --> 53:00.560]  To be a patriot
[53:00.560 --> 53:02.560]  You are the people listening
[53:02.560 --> 53:04.560]  Of every race, color, and creed
[53:04.560 --> 53:06.560]  Who bleed red blood and love God
[53:06.560 --> 53:08.560]  That are the tip of that spear
[53:08.560 --> 53:10.560]  That are that fire of resistance
[53:10.560 --> 53:12.560]  That are the will of God
[53:12.560 --> 53:14.560]  Manifest on this planet
[53:14.560 --> 53:16.560]  And you must recognize who you are
[53:16.560 --> 53:18.560]  And your strength
[53:18.560 --> 53:20.560]  And know that you do this for the children
[53:20.560 --> 53:23.560]  And you must shut your will in motion
[53:23.560 --> 53:25.560]  Before God
[53:29.560 --> 53:31.560]  And that is the great quest
[53:31.560 --> 53:34.560]  The whole plane of existence on this planet
[53:35.560 --> 53:37.560]  And I want all of us to join together
[53:37.560 --> 53:40.560]  In eternity with God
[53:40.560 --> 53:43.560]  And break the will of Satan
[53:43.560 --> 53:46.560]  In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[53:50.560 --> 53:53.560]  I'm going to give the toll free number out in a moment
[53:53.560 --> 53:55.560]  For first time callers again today
[53:55.560 --> 53:58.560]  And after we put 20 calls on the board
[53:58.560 --> 54:01.560]  We'll open it up to all the callers
[54:01.560 --> 54:03.560]  But I want to give people that have never been able to get through
[54:03.560 --> 54:05.560]  That have tried so many times
[54:05.560 --> 54:07.560]  A chance to join us here
[54:07.560 --> 54:09.560]  To discuss any topic, any issue, nothing's off limits
[54:09.560 --> 54:11.560]  Nothing's censored
[54:11.560 --> 54:12.560]  It's not really a pet peeve
[54:12.560 --> 54:14.560]  It's just been asked to me thousands of times
[54:14.560 --> 54:16.560]  And it's always the same answer
[54:16.560 --> 54:18.560]  When you call in, we don't screen your call
[54:18.560 --> 54:19.560]  If you want to tell us what you're calling about
[54:19.560 --> 54:20.560]  Or where you're calling from
[54:20.560 --> 54:22.560]  Or what the topic is, that's fine
[54:22.560 --> 54:24.560]  But you can say no topic at all
[54:24.560 --> 54:26.560]  We're going to put you on air
[54:26.560 --> 54:28.560]  Just have a clean phone line
[54:28.560 --> 54:30.560]  And then don't ask me on air
[54:30.560 --> 54:32.560]  Can I get into this, can I get into that
[54:32.560 --> 54:34.560]  You are welcome here
[54:34.560 --> 54:36.560]  And the door is open
[54:36.560 --> 54:38.560]  And the table is round
[54:38.560 --> 54:40.560]  Meaning we're all listening to each other
[54:40.560 --> 54:42.560]  And no one's at the head of the table
[54:42.560 --> 54:44.560]  And I respect you
[54:44.560 --> 54:46.560]  And I want to hear your ideas
[54:46.560 --> 54:48.560]  And I appreciate you brothers and sisters

[54:56.560 --> 54:58.560]  877-789-2539
[54:58.560 --> 55:00.560]  Before I get back on the news
[55:00.560 --> 55:02.560]  I just want to take a few minutes out here
[55:02.560 --> 55:04.560]  To recognize and appreciate
[55:04.560 --> 55:06.560]  The great crew and the wonderful work they do
[55:06.560 --> 55:08.560]  And to thank all the great listeners
[55:08.560 --> 55:10.560]  And activists and our sponsors
[55:10.560 --> 55:12.560]  And our radio affiliates
[55:12.560 --> 55:14.560]  And TV affiliates from WWCR
[55:14.560 --> 55:16.560]  Right down the line
[55:16.560 --> 55:18.560]  And all the great work they do
[55:18.560 --> 55:20.560]  Because when I get the credit for this broadcast
[55:20.560 --> 55:22.560]  I do not deserve it
[55:22.560 --> 55:24.560]  You come first, you come second
[55:24.560 --> 55:26.560]  I'm just a focal point because
[55:26.560 --> 55:28.560]  I have trouble bending over
[55:28.560 --> 55:30.560]  I have trouble watching scams
[55:30.560 --> 55:32.560]  I have trouble watching liars
[55:32.560 --> 55:34.560]  Get away with things
[55:34.560 --> 55:36.560]  I get angry at pedophiles
[55:36.560 --> 55:38.560]  I have a drive
[55:38.560 --> 55:40.560]  To resist these people
[55:40.560 --> 55:42.560]  Because I know who they are
[55:42.560 --> 55:44.560]  And I know they must be stopped
[55:44.560 --> 55:46.560]  Because I know deep down the fire
[55:46.560 --> 55:48.560]  I've got in my heart and my belly
[55:48.560 --> 55:50.560]  And my will that's driving me
[55:50.560 --> 55:52.560]  To defeat these people
[55:52.560 --> 55:54.560]  Is because that's what
[55:54.560 --> 55:56.560]  God demands
[55:56.560 --> 55:58.560]  It is not something you elect to do
[55:58.560 --> 56:00.560]  You will do it
[56:00.560 --> 56:02.560]  Or you will be cut off
[56:02.560 --> 56:04.560]  For eternity from God
[56:04.560 --> 56:06.560]  And be put with these people
[56:06.560 --> 56:08.560]  And you do not want to be with the left hand path
[56:08.560 --> 56:10.560]  You do not want to be
[56:10.560 --> 56:12.560]  With Aleister Crowley
[56:12.560 --> 56:14.560]  And Madame Blavatsky
[56:14.560 --> 56:16.560]  And the whole New World Order
[56:16.560 --> 56:20.560]  And the system of where they've gone
[56:20.560 --> 56:22.560]  You want to be
[56:22.560 --> 56:24.560]  With the progenitor of life
[56:24.560 --> 56:26.560]  The creator of free will
[56:26.560 --> 56:28.560]  The true architect of the entire system
[56:28.560 --> 56:30.560]  It's said that Satan's called
[56:30.560 --> 56:32.560]  The great architect
[56:32.560 --> 56:34.560]  People go, oh, the great architect
[56:34.560 --> 56:36.560]  Satan is a counterfeit
[56:36.560 --> 56:38.560]  And everything Satan
[56:38.560 --> 56:40.560]  Claims he gives you is a lie
[56:40.560 --> 56:42.560]  Satan claims, oh, great sex
[56:42.560 --> 56:44.560]  Wild parties
[56:44.560 --> 56:46.560]  God gave us sex
[56:46.560 --> 56:48.560]  God gave us wealth
[56:48.560 --> 56:50.560]  Everything we have
[56:50.560 --> 56:52.560]  And we have to recognize that
[56:52.560 --> 56:54.560]  And make that
[56:54.560 --> 56:56.560]  Interdimensional, intergalactic
[56:56.560 --> 56:58.560]  Interstellar connection to that
[56:58.560 --> 57:00.560]  And it's there and it's waiting

[57:12.560 --> 57:14.560]  We're going to come back
[57:14.560 --> 57:16.560]  We're going to cover a ton of news

[59:04.560 --> 59:06.560]  At cost right now
[59:06.560 --> 59:08.560]  That's just regular plain chain shirts
[59:08.560 --> 59:10.560]  That is all sorts of designer
[59:10.560 --> 59:12.560]  Shirts that cost us
[59:12.560 --> 59:14.560]  $15, $20, $25 to produce
[59:14.560 --> 59:16.560]  We used to sell for $40
[59:16.560 --> 59:18.560]  We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20
[59:18.560 --> 59:20.560]  Whatever the shirt costs us
[59:20.560 --> 59:22.560]  A shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5
[59:22.560 --> 59:24.560]  For us to actually produce
[59:24.560 --> 59:26.560]  It costs $10, we're selling it for $10
[59:26.560 --> 59:28.560]  And we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves
[59:28.560 --> 59:30.560]  And we've got short sleeves, we've got them all
[59:30.560 --> 59:32.560]  And we've got to liquidate them all
[59:32.560 --> 59:34.560]  Because we're never going to make
[59:34.560 --> 59:36.560]  Any of these designs again
[59:36.560 --> 59:38.560]  We are going to come out with some new designs
[59:38.560 --> 59:40.560]  That will be limited, limited edition
[59:40.560 --> 59:42.560]  In the future, we've got to sell this
[59:42.560 --> 59:44.560]  To keep M4s on the air, plus it spreads the word
[59:44.560 --> 59:46.560]  InfowarsStore.com
[59:46.560 --> 1:00:02.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order
[1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:04.560]  Now into hour number two
[1:00:04.560 --> 1:00:06.560]  The phone lines are loading up here on the Alex Jones show
[1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:08.560]  We'll talk more about how Biden must be impeached
[1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:10.560]  And so much more in the next segment
[1:00:10.560 --> 1:00:12.560]  I want to play a few clips here
[1:00:12.560 --> 1:00:14.560]  With Congressman
[1:00:14.560 --> 1:00:16.560]  Carmack and
[1:00:16.560 --> 1:00:18.560]  Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene
[1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:20.560]  Talking about food security
[1:00:20.560 --> 1:00:22.560]  Is national security and where the baby formula
[1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:24.560]  Is being sent, of course
[1:00:24.560 --> 1:00:26.560]  And just how sick all of this is
[1:00:26.560 --> 1:00:28.560]  As they try to overtake the carrying capacity
[1:00:28.560 --> 1:00:30.560]  Of the western world and collapse it
[1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:32.560]  This is true siege
[1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:34.560]  21st century warfare
[1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:36.560]  Being carried out against you and your family
[1:00:36.560 --> 1:00:38.560]  And we have got to get
[1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:40.560]  The pastors and the talk show host
[1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:42.560]  And the legislators and the governors
[1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:44.560]  Just saying no, we are not
[1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:46.560]  Going to be part of this and we realize
[1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:48.560]  The global corporations are squeezing small
[1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:50.560]  Companies and individuals and families
[1:00:50.560 --> 1:00:52.560]  To destroy us. All right, here are these two
[1:00:52.560 --> 1:00:54.560]  Important statements back to back
[1:00:54.560 --> 1:00:56.560]  And we'll go to break and come back with your calls
[1:00:56.560 --> 1:00:58.560]  And right now we have a food security crisis
[1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:00.560]  For the most vulnerable of Americans
[1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:02.560]  The ones that we cherish the most
[1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:04.560]  And that's our babies
[1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:06.560]  Moms and dads all over the country
[1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:08.560]  Some of them are traveling
[1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:10.560]  Hours every single day
[1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:12.560]  Looking for baby formulas
[1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:14.560]  They can't find it in their local grocery stores
[1:01:14.560 --> 1:01:16.560]  They are reaching out to friends and families
[1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:18.560]  And making new friends in Facebook groups
[1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:20.560]  And online as they are searching
[1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:22.560]  To find baby formula
[1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:24.560]  Even mothers that have been giving their babies
[1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:26.560]  Baby formula are now searching out
[1:01:26.560 --> 1:01:28.560]  Restfeeding mothers looking to buy
[1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:30.560]  An extra supply of milk
[1:01:30.560 --> 1:01:32.560]  If they are willing to share it or sell it
[1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:34.560]  This is a crisis that should never be happening
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:36.560]  And this is completely
[1:01:36.560 --> 1:01:38.560]  Squarely on the shoulders of
[1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:40.560]  The administration and the Democrats
[1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:42.560]  That are controlling our government
[1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:44.560]  You see, this didn't start just last month
[1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:46.560]  It was July of last year
[1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:48.560]  When baby formula shortages started
[1:01:48.560 --> 1:01:50.560]  And that happened because of COVID
[1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:52.560]  Lockdowns and the complete
[1:01:52.560 --> 1:01:54.560]  System shutdown in our supply chains
[1:01:54.560 --> 1:01:56.560]  Now with rising inflation
[1:01:56.560 --> 1:01:58.560]  And fuel prices
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:00.560]  This is going to continue
[1:02:00.560 --> 1:02:02.560]  This is not going to remedy itself quickly
[1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:04.560]  We also have over-regulation
[1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:06.560]  Through the FDA
[1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:08.560]  And this has been going on for years
[1:02:08.560 --> 1:02:10.560]  Label requirements, shipping requirements
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:12.560]  And very strict rules
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:14.560]  When it comes to baby formula
[1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:16.560]  So it's not just getting a supply here at home
[1:02:16.560 --> 1:02:18.560]  It's difficult to get it from overseas
[1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:20.560]  When you have mothers crying
[1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:22.560]  In grocery stores because
[1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:24.560]  They can't find food to feed their babies
[1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:26.560]  That is a critical sign
[1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:28.560]  That we are in a country in despair
[1:02:28.560 --> 1:02:30.560]  We are a country in crisis
[1:02:30.560 --> 1:02:32.560]  And we have to do everything we can
[1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:34.560]  To change it
[1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:36.560]  We know this government is failing
[1:02:36.560 --> 1:02:38.560]  The American people
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:40.560]  The taxpayers and its citizens
[1:02:40.560 --> 1:02:42.560]  Pictures are emerging
[1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:44.560]  Today from the border
[1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:46.560]  Where the Biden administration has been
[1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:48.560]  Sending pallets of baby
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:50.560]  Baby formula
[1:02:50.560 --> 1:02:52.560]  For illegal mothers and their babies
[1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:54.560]  While American mothers and babies
[1:02:54.560 --> 1:02:56.560]  Cannot find baby formula
[1:02:56.560 --> 1:02:58.560]  This is completely unacceptable
[1:02:58.560 --> 1:03:00.560]  And this needs to end
[1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:02.560]  Now
[1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:04.560]  One thing to say
[1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:06.560]  And this is something that
[1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:08.560]  It's hard to even imagine
[1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:10.560]  But we cannot trust our government
[1:03:10.560 --> 1:03:12.560]  If you're an expecting mother
[1:03:12.560 --> 1:03:14.560]  I urge you, strongly urge you
[1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:16.560]  To do the best you can to try to breastfeed your baby
[1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:18.560]  Because you cannot depend
[1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:20.560]  On this government
[1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:22.560]  That is supposedly running our country
[1:03:22.560 --> 1:03:24.560]  To create the right conditions
[1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:26.560]  In our economy
[1:03:26.560 --> 1:03:28.560]  For you to be able to find baby formula
[1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:30.560]  And this should never ever happen
[1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:32.560]  I think Congresswoman Stefanik
[1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:34.560]  I think my colleagues that we're all
[1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:36.560]  Joining together to work on this
[1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:38.560]  Absolutely have to share with you right now
[1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:40.560]  Is the craziness of the
[1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:42.560]  Empty shelves Biden movement
[1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:44.560]  And the fact that they are sending pallets
[1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:46.560]  Pallets
[1:03:46.560 --> 1:03:48.560]  Of baby formula to the border
[1:03:48.560 --> 1:03:50.560]  Meanwhile, in our own district
[1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:52.560]  At home, we cannot
[1:03:52.560 --> 1:03:54.560]  Find baby formula
[1:03:54.560 --> 1:03:56.560]  This is a picture from a target
[1:03:56.560 --> 1:03:58.560]  Oh, it's upside down, sorry
[1:03:58.560 --> 1:04:00.560]  Okay, we literally
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:02.560]  Are struggling to find
[1:04:02.560 --> 1:04:04.560]  Baby formula around the country
[1:04:04.560 --> 1:04:06.560]  Moms are struggling
[1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:08.560]  Going from store to store to store
[1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:10.560]  And then the stores are actually capping
[1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:12.560]  The amount of baby formula
[1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:14.560]  That they will sell them
[1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:16.560]  And this got sent to me by a
[1:04:16.560 --> 1:04:18.560]  Border patrol agent this morning
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:20.560]  And said, this is disgusting
[1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:22.560]  You will not believe this
[1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:24.560]  They're receiving pallets
[1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:26.560]  And more pallets
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:28.560]  Of baby formula
[1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:30.560]  At the border
[1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:32.560]  This was taken at Ursula
[1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:34.560]  Processing facility
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:36.560]  Where thousands are being
[1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:38.560]  Housed and processed
[1:04:38.560 --> 1:04:40.560]  And then released subsequently
[1:04:40.560 --> 1:04:42.560]  Into the United States
[1:04:42.560 --> 1:04:44.560]  So think about this
[1:04:44.560 --> 1:04:46.560]  This is what America last looks like
[1:04:46.560 --> 1:04:48.560]  This is 100% what it looks like
[1:04:48.560 --> 1:04:50.560]  And in response, Congress
[1:04:50.560 --> 1:04:52.560]  We actually before I even got these photos
[1:04:52.560 --> 1:04:54.560]  We were working
[1:04:54.560 --> 1:04:56.560]  With
[1:04:56.560 --> 1:04:58.560]  Here at Info Wars
[1:04:58.560 --> 1:05:00.560]  Our slogan is
[1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:02.560]  Tomorrow's news today
[1:05:02.560 --> 1:05:04.560]  Whether it's politics or health
[1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:06.560]  Or spirituality
[1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:08.560]  Weird about bringing you the very best
[1:05:08.560 --> 1:05:10.560]  Documented, accurate
[1:05:10.560 --> 1:05:12.560]  Real world information
[1:05:12.560 --> 1:05:14.560]  And when it comes to our supplements
[1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:16.560]  They are so game changing for your body
[1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:18.560]  For your health, your immunity, your libido
[1:05:18.560 --> 1:05:20.560]  Your middle clarity

[1:05:28.560 --> 1:05:30.560]  Atomic iodine you're going to find
[1:05:30.560 --> 1:05:32.560]  Most other iodine out there
[1:05:32.560 --> 1:05:34.560]  Is bound to other minerals
[1:05:34.560 --> 1:05:36.560]  And compounds so you don't absorb it
[1:05:36.560 --> 1:05:38.560]  At all or fully
[1:05:38.560 --> 1:05:40.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got a limited supply
[1:05:40.560 --> 1:05:42.560]  And it's been sold out for months
[1:05:42.560 --> 1:05:44.560]  But despite that
[1:05:44.560 --> 1:05:46.560]  We're selling it at 25% off
[1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:48.560]  For one more week

[1:06:26.560 --> 1:06:28.560]  Our fellow humans across the globe
[1:06:28.560 --> 1:06:31.560]  We are going to defeat the new world order
[1:06:31.560 --> 1:06:33.560]  It has been foretold
[1:06:33.560 --> 1:06:35.560]  And we can already smell the victory
[1:06:35.560 --> 1:06:37.560]  It's Friday the 13th
[1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:40.560]  On this May 13th broadcast
[1:06:40.560 --> 1:06:42.560]  I am your host Alex Jones
[1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:45.560]  And we are the human resistance
[1:06:45.560 --> 1:06:48.560]  And I can feel your strength
[1:06:49.560 --> 1:06:51.560]  I can feel your will
[1:06:51.560 --> 1:06:57.560]  I can feel your power
[1:07:00.560 --> 1:07:02.560]  Checking your phone calls the next two hours
[1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:05.560]  Starting at the next segment
[1:07:05.560 --> 1:07:07.560]  I'm going to hit a lot of news right now
[1:07:07.560 --> 1:07:09.560]  Here on the World Wide Broadcast
[1:07:09.560 --> 1:07:12.560]  That exists in defiance to tyranny
[1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:13.560]  And defensive liberty
[1:07:13.560 --> 1:07:15.560]  And that outrages the enemies
[1:07:15.560 --> 1:07:21.560]  Of our people to no end
[1:07:21.560 --> 1:07:23.560]  We are strong
[1:07:23.560 --> 1:07:25.560]  The devil is broken
[1:07:25.560 --> 1:07:27.560]  And that's why he comes to try
[1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:29.560]  To kill, steal and destroy
[1:07:29.560 --> 1:07:31.560]  Alright, I want to hit
[1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:33.560]  The situation in Ukraine
[1:07:33.560 --> 1:07:35.560]  There's some really huge developments there
[1:07:35.560 --> 1:07:37.560]  But I really like what Joe Rogan's been doing lately
[1:07:37.560 --> 1:07:39.560]  He's been hitting on all cylinders
[1:07:39.560 --> 1:07:41.560]  And saying basically every podcast
[1:07:41.560 --> 1:07:42.560]  Nice things about the broadcast
[1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:44.560]  We appreciate that Joe
[1:07:44.560 --> 1:07:46.560]  And he's really awake
[1:07:46.560 --> 1:07:47.560]  Totally awake now
[1:07:47.560 --> 1:07:49.560]  It's hard for him to believe how evil the system is
[1:07:49.560 --> 1:07:50.560]  But he gets it now
[1:07:50.560 --> 1:07:51.560]  Now that he shifted his perspective
[1:07:51.560 --> 1:07:53.560]  And now it all makes sense
[1:07:53.560 --> 1:07:55.560]  He's coming out and talking about how
[1:07:55.560 --> 1:07:56.560]  The dictator up in Canada
[1:07:56.560 --> 1:07:57.560]  He stole the election
[1:07:57.560 --> 1:07:59.560]  Declared martial law
[1:07:59.560 --> 1:08:01.560]  How he's a creepy son of a bitch
[1:08:01.560 --> 1:08:03.560]  And this is the spirit we need
[1:08:03.560 --> 1:08:05.560]  Realizing these are our enemies
[1:08:05.560 --> 1:08:08.560]  And not even at a debate level with them
[1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:10.560]  We know they're agents of the Davos Group
[1:08:10.560 --> 1:08:11.560]  That's penetrated our governments
[1:08:11.560 --> 1:08:12.560]  And taken over
[1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:13.560]  And who created the Davos Group?
[1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:14.560]  The Bilderberg Group
[1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:15.560]  What's their goal?
[1:08:15.560 --> 1:08:16.560]  The world government?
[1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:17.560]  The population?
[1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:18.560]  It's on record
[1:08:18.560 --> 1:08:19.560]  Here it is
[1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:23.560]  Great of taxation
[1:08:23.560 --> 1:08:25.560]  But I always knew that Canada was really high
[1:08:25.560 --> 1:08:26.560]  It used to be
[1:08:26.560 --> 1:08:27.560]  The Canada was high
[1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:28.560]  But crime was lower
[1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:29.560]  The United States
[1:08:29.560 --> 1:08:30.560]  People were friendlier
[1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:31.560]  It seems like a great system
[1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:33.560]  Because you have socialized medicine
[1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:36.560]  You have some sort of a healthcare system up there
[1:08:36.560 --> 1:08:38.560]  Although there's a lot of complaints about that as well
[1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:40.560]  Your education system
[1:08:40.560 --> 1:08:43.560]  It seems like it's more accessible to people
[1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:44.560]  To go to college
[1:08:44.560 --> 1:08:45.560]  And things like that
[1:08:45.560 --> 1:08:47.560]  So you're contributing into this pile
[1:08:47.560 --> 1:08:48.560]  Which is fine
[1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:50.560]  But then when you have
[1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:53.560]  What's a creepy fucking dictator
[1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:54.560]  For a prime minister
[1:08:54.560 --> 1:08:55.560]  And that's what he is
[1:08:55.560 --> 1:08:57.560]  The way he behaves
[1:08:57.560 --> 1:08:58.560]  The way he behaved during this thing
[1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:00.560]  And just the disingenuous way
[1:09:00.560 --> 1:09:02.560]  That he communicated
[1:09:02.560 --> 1:09:03.560]  It freaked me out
[1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:05.560]  Because I never thought that guy was like that
[1:09:05.560 --> 1:09:07.560]  We had a conversation a few years ago
[1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:09.560]  Where you were sort of more positive
[1:09:09.560 --> 1:09:10.560]  I thought he was a handsome fellow
[1:09:10.560 --> 1:09:11.560]  With a good vocabulary
[1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:13.560]  And seems like a nice guy
[1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:15.560]  Before he really leaned into the woke stuff
[1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:18.560]  I just thought he was a kind, sensitive guy
[1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:19.560]  And I was like
[1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:21.560]  That's probably a good disposition
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:22.560]  To be a leader
[1:09:22.560 --> 1:09:27.560]  But just the way he labeled those truckers
[1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:30.560]  As racist for no reason
[1:09:30.560 --> 1:09:32.560]  The people protesting against mandates
[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:34.560]  He decided they were misogynists
[1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:35.560]  And racist
[1:09:35.560 --> 1:09:36.560]  That's phobic
[1:09:36.560 --> 1:09:37.560]  Yeah
[1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:39.560]  But the way he did it was just like
[1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:42.560]  He just cast a pejorative label on them
[1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:43.560]  With no evidence
[1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:46.560]  With no provocation
[1:09:46.560 --> 1:09:47.560]  It was just like
[1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:49.560]  I'm going to label them this
[1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:51.560]  So that I can impose laws
[1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:54.560]  To stop them from doing what is essentially
[1:09:54.560 --> 1:09:55.560]  A peaceful protest
[1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:58.560]  So let me tell you about the draconian measures
[1:09:58.560 --> 1:09:59.560]  We've had in Quebec
[1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:01.560]  Oh, I know
[1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:02.560]  You know about it
[1:10:02.560 --> 1:10:03.560]  Yeah, I have friends
[1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:04.560]  I have friends that live in Quebec
[1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:05.560]  And they're furious
[1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:07.560]  So we still have, by the way, masks
[1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:10.560]  I think they're removing them on May 14th
[1:10:10.560 --> 1:10:11.560]  Right, so the first time
[1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:15.560]  We got to get Gad sad back on
[1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:16.560]  He's a really smart guy
[1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:19.560]  So
[1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:23.560]  Pulling back from this
[1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:27.560]  It's critical to understand
[1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:30.560]  That the whole liberal, fake, effeminate act
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:31.560]  Of people like Trudeau is an act
[1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:34.560]  These are psychotic control freaks
[1:10:34.560 --> 1:10:38.560]  And they're trained in NLP
[1:10:38.560 --> 1:10:41.560]  And all other forms of different psychological warfare
[1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:42.560]  They're sent to special schools
[1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:43.560]  It's on record
[1:10:43.560 --> 1:10:45.560]  They're sent to Debo schools
[1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:47.560]  To do all this
[1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:50.560]  To make themselves sound as non-threatening as possible
[1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:52.560]  I call it the MPR voice
[1:10:52.560 --> 1:10:54.560]  Very soft, very nice
[1:10:54.560 --> 1:10:55.560]  Very, oh
[1:10:55.560 --> 1:10:58.560]  To lull you into a sense of security
[1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:02.560]  When these people are literally trying to kill you
[1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:05.560]  Canada now is euthanizing old people
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:06.560]  Without their permission
[1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:08.560]  Which we always warned it would lead to
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:13.560]  So think of the most selfish, horrible, wicked stuff
[1:11:13.560 --> 1:11:16.560]  You can imagine and then go further
[1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:18.560]  And that's who these people are
[1:11:18.560 --> 1:11:20.560]  Whatever you can imagine
[1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:21.560]  And it's all on record
[1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:22.560]  They're doing it
[1:11:22.560 --> 1:11:24.560]  Because once you become evil
[1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:26.560]  And you have no morals
[1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:29.560]  Then the very worst
[1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:32.560]  Remove those that are just corrupt and want power
[1:11:32.560 --> 1:11:38.560]  And puts in people that have sick, twisted, satanic fetishes
[1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:40.560]  To hurt innocent people
[1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:43.560]  So that's why what Joe was talking about
[1:11:43.560 --> 1:11:45.560]  Is there, it's so important
[1:11:45.560 --> 1:11:48.560]  And notice, Joe's a master
[1:11:48.560 --> 1:11:50.560]  Of going, oh, free healthcare
[1:11:50.560 --> 1:11:52.560]  It sounded so good, so liberal, so loving
[1:11:52.560 --> 1:11:54.560]  To get liberals to listen
[1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:56.560]  And that's why he's so effective
[1:11:56.560 --> 1:11:58.560]  Is he's there
[1:11:58.560 --> 1:12:00.560]  Oh, I'm with you, but oh, this is really bad
[1:12:00.560 --> 1:12:02.560]  And he actually convinces people
[1:12:02.560 --> 1:12:04.560]  Whereas I do the frontal assault
[1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:06.560]  And he's not right, I'm not right
[1:12:06.560 --> 1:12:08.560]  He's not wrong, I'm not wrong
[1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:11.560]  Different approaches
[1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:14.560]  Are gonna reach different people
[1:12:14.560 --> 1:12:16.560]  But that's why they fear Joe
[1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:20.560]  Is that he's very smooth about it
[1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:23.560]  And he talks to them in their NPR voice
[1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:25.560]  And he programs them
[1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:27.560]  And he's doing a great job
[1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:29.560]  And some of the listeners are like, well, Joe's not perfect
[1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:31.560]  Is this and that
[1:12:31.560 --> 1:12:36.560]  Believe me, Joe is completely on board
[1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:38.560]  And the system knows that
[1:12:38.560 --> 1:12:41.560]  But he has decided another path to beat them
[1:12:41.560 --> 1:12:43.560]  And I say more power to him
[1:12:43.560 --> 1:12:48.560]  Now, let's hit some of this military news
[1:12:48.560 --> 1:12:51.560]  If you look at maps, I should have told the crew
[1:12:51.560 --> 1:12:54.560]  Of NATO 1993
[1:12:54.560 --> 1:12:57.560]  Type in maps of NATO 1993
[1:12:57.560 --> 1:12:59.560]  NATO 2022
[1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:01.560]  And you'll see NATO's doubled in size
[1:13:01.560 --> 1:13:03.560]  And is all around Russia
[1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:06.560]  And is then fomenting movements to
[1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:09.560]  Overthrow the Russian government inside their country
[1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:10.560]  Which is an active war
[1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:12.560]  Admitting we're in a proxy war with Russia
[1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:14.560]  Tens of billions of dollars of weapons
[1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:15.560]  Already shipped in
[1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:17.560]  And now 40 billion
[1:13:17.560 --> 1:13:19.560]  Rand Paul's blocking it right now
[1:13:19.560 --> 1:13:21.560]  But 40 billion passed in the house
[1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:23.560]  In two hours, no one had a chance to read the bill
[1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:24.560]  Now we're learning about it
[1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:25.560]  It is just insane
[1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:27.560]  For domestic propaganda here
[1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:29.560]  All sorts of illegal CIA operations
[1:13:29.560 --> 1:13:32.560]  I mean, it is coup funding money
[1:13:32.560 --> 1:13:34.560]  So if you look at NATO
[1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:36.560]  In the baby blue of your TV viewer
[1:13:36.560 --> 1:13:41.560]  It's in only a few countries in 1949, 1982
[1:13:41.560 --> 1:13:43.560]  The 1990, it expands into Poland
[1:13:43.560 --> 1:13:44.560]  And a bunch of other countries
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:47.560]  1999 expands, 2009 expands
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:50.560]  And then now if you look where it's expanded today
[1:13:50.560 --> 1:13:52.560]  It's even larger
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:55.560]  And the best maps, great job finding that map
[1:13:55.560 --> 1:13:57.560]  Yeah, that's a better one
[1:13:57.560 --> 1:13:59.560]  It just shows the switch
[1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:01.560]  1999 to 2015, there's a map
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:03.560]  And as you see, that's doubled in size
[1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:05.560]  And now it's even more
[1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:08.560]  And now they're trying to take Ukraine
[1:14:08.560 --> 1:14:10.560]  Which is as Russian as it gets
[1:14:10.560 --> 1:14:14.560]  I mean, Ukraine is Russia's mama
[1:14:14.560 --> 1:14:16.560]  And has there been a battle for thousands of years
[1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:18.560]  Whether Europe or Russia will run Ukraine?
[1:14:18.560 --> 1:14:19.560]  Yeah
[1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:22.560]  It's a very Germanic country in the west
[1:14:22.560 --> 1:14:24.560]  A very Slavic country in the east
[1:14:24.560 --> 1:14:26.560]  But they're all intermarried
[1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:30.560]  And that leads us to this
[1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:37.560]  Russia has said that if you keep taking members in
[1:14:37.560 --> 1:14:39.560]  It's an act of war, you gotta stop
[1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:41.560]  We had an agreement in 1993 to not do this
[1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:43.560]  1992
[1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:48.560]  Finland will be a NATO backwater
[1:14:48.560 --> 1:14:50.560]  Russia threatens military and technical measures
[1:14:50.560 --> 1:14:53.560]  If it enters, Finland has now officially
[1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:57.560]  Put in their application to enter NATO
[1:14:57.560 --> 1:15:00.560]  In the next 12 months
[1:15:00.560 --> 1:15:02.560]  And Russia has now announced it's going to cut
[1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:04.560]  The power supply to Finland tomorrow
[1:15:04.560 --> 1:15:06.560]  I mean, this is all out war
[1:15:06.560 --> 1:15:08.560]  Rand Paul blocks 40 billion to Ukraine
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:10.560]  Citing inflation at home
[1:15:10.560 --> 1:15:12.560]  Lack of basic food stuffs
[1:15:12.560 --> 1:15:14.560]  French open warns Russian players
[1:15:14.560 --> 1:15:17.560]  Not to make political statements of support for Putin
[1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:19.560]  That's saying you're just against the war
[1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:21.560]  And that there should be detente
[1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:25.560]  Very important statements by Gosar
[1:15:25.560 --> 1:15:27.560]  Congressman Gosar
[1:15:27.560 --> 1:15:29.560]  Russia not our enemy US Congressman
[1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:31.560]  I'm going to get to that later
[1:15:31.560 --> 1:15:33.560]  But I want to go to your phone calls
[1:15:33.560 --> 1:15:35.560]  When we come back, we've also, as I said
[1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:37.560]  Got a bunch of censorship news, economy news
[1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:40.560]  COVID news, transgender power grab news
[1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:42.560]  Randy Weber died, good friend of mine
[1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:44.560]  Great patriot

[1:22:04.560 --> 1:22:07.560]  Joe Biden is an effing enemy
[1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:09.560]  agent of the New World Order
[1:22:09.560 --> 1:22:12.560]  it is purposely starving and bankrupting our great nation
[1:22:12.560 --> 1:22:15.560]  but he himself is just a puppet
[1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:19.560]  dementia-ridden Biden and his pack of lying scum
[1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:22.560]  are now claiming there's no baby formula shortage
[1:22:22.560 --> 1:22:25.560]  and they're not handing out crack pipes
[1:22:25.560 --> 1:22:27.560]  they're lying to our face
[1:22:29.560 --> 1:22:32.560]  start your weekend with this explosive
[1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:34.560]  one-of-a-kind edition of the Alex Jones show
[1:22:34.560 --> 1:22:37.560]  globalists want you
[1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:39.560]  to get high and die
[1:22:39.560 --> 1:22:41.560]  as they pillage the nation
[1:22:41.560 --> 1:22:44.560]  and escalate war
[1:22:44.560 --> 1:22:49.560]  against nuclear-powered Russia
[1:22:49.560 --> 1:22:52.560]  all right we got Jack, we got Rachel, we got Kim, we got Randy
[1:22:52.560 --> 1:22:57.560]  we got Holy Stride, we got Daniel, we got Kevin, we got Sarah, we got Dave, we got Lee
[1:22:57.560 --> 1:22:59.560]  we got Dylan and we're taking the calls
[1:22:59.560 --> 1:23:04.560]  and the order they were received unfiltered
[1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:06.560]  uncensored, teleprompter-free
[1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:07.560]  it's real
[1:23:07.560 --> 1:23:09.560]  what a rare thing today
[1:23:09.560 --> 1:23:11.560]  something the globalists don't like happening
[1:23:11.560 --> 1:23:13.560]  it's happening now together
[1:23:13.560 --> 1:23:15.560]  a ritual of freedom
[1:23:15.560 --> 1:23:18.560]  Jack in South Carolina, thank you for calling
[1:23:18.560 --> 1:23:20.560]  on this Friday the 13th
[1:23:20.560 --> 1:23:23.560]  Mr. Jones, thank you
[1:23:23.560 --> 1:23:26.560]  I went to high school
[1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:28.560]  with Ted Turner's grandchildren
[1:23:28.560 --> 1:23:30.560]  and super nice people
[1:23:30.560 --> 1:23:32.560]  I just don't see how they could be
[1:23:32.560 --> 1:23:34.560]  read into all the stuff
[1:23:34.560 --> 1:23:36.560]  and I've seen that photo
[1:23:36.560 --> 1:23:39.560]  of him with Fauci and Bill Gates' dad
[1:23:39.560 --> 1:23:41.560]  and several others
[1:23:41.560 --> 1:23:43.560]  and I was just wondering
[1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:45.560]  what knowledge you had on him
[1:23:45.560 --> 1:23:47.560]  and then also
[1:23:47.560 --> 1:23:49.560]  I know it's better if it comes
[1:23:49.560 --> 1:23:51.560]  naturally from you
[1:23:51.560 --> 1:23:53.560]  but thank you so much
[1:23:53.560 --> 1:23:56.560]  for opening my eyes to so much stuff
[1:23:56.560 --> 1:23:58.560]  especially so much religious stuff
[1:23:58.560 --> 1:24:00.560]  and I continue to fail
[1:24:00.560 --> 1:24:02.560]  and
[1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:04.560]  I think it's just so powerful
[1:24:04.560 --> 1:24:05.560]  when you pray for us
[1:24:05.560 --> 1:24:07.560]  and if you could finish with a prayer one more time
[1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:09.560]  I would really appreciate that
[1:24:09.560 --> 1:24:12.560]  Alright Jack, let me try to answer your question
[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:15.560]  I don't go off photos of people together
[1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:17.560]  because somebody can jump up next to me
[1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:18.560]  and take a photo
[1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:19.560]  or they can jump up next to you
[1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:20.560]  you don't know who they are
[1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:21.560]  or later they get in trouble
[1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:22.560]  and they say you're part of them
[1:24:22.560 --> 1:24:25.560]  I go off what Ted Turner funded
[1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:27.560]  and did
[1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:29.560]  he was involved
[1:24:29.560 --> 1:24:30.560]  40 years ago
[1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:32.560]  setting up these private NGOs
[1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:33.560]  with the Bilderberg group
[1:24:33.560 --> 1:24:34.560]  for what they built today
[1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:35.560]  he says
[1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:37.560]  we only need 500 million people
[1:24:37.560 --> 1:24:40.560]  maybe
[1:24:40.560 --> 1:24:42.560]  most of these really rich powerful globalists
[1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:44.560]  don't even talk to their grandchildren
[1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:46.560]  I know he says you shouldn't be able to have any children
[1:24:46.560 --> 1:24:48.560]  I think he had six
[1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:50.560]  and I think he's got like 25 grandchildren
[1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:51.560]  last time I checked
[1:24:51.560 --> 1:24:53.560]  guys looked that up
[1:24:53.560 --> 1:24:55.560]  but
[1:24:55.560 --> 1:24:56.560]  you shouldn't have children
[1:24:56.560 --> 1:24:58.560]  he's going to have children
[1:24:58.560 --> 1:24:59.560]  and he was involved of course
[1:24:59.560 --> 1:25:01.560]  with the Georgia Guidestones and more
[1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:03.560]  so we know who he is
[1:25:03.560 --> 1:25:04.560]  from his action
[1:25:04.560 --> 1:25:05.560]  I made a film
[1:25:05.560 --> 1:25:07.560]  America Destroyed by Design
[1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:08.560]  we show the documents
[1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:09.560]  to prove his statements
[1:25:09.560 --> 1:25:11.560]  my first film I made in 1997
[1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:13.560]  and it's all there
[1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:14.560]  the film is still free online
[1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:15.560]  you can find it by looking
[1:25:15.560 --> 1:25:17.560]  so it's like on rumble
[1:25:17.560 --> 1:25:19.560]  and places they've taken it down everywhere else
[1:25:19.560 --> 1:25:21.560]  it's also on
[1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:23.560]  prismplanet.tv
[1:25:23.560 --> 1:25:24.560]  which used to be a subscriber site
[1:25:24.560 --> 1:25:26.560]  back when we were making plenty of money
[1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:27.560]  in 2016
[1:25:27.560 --> 1:25:30.560]  I said well we've got plenty of money
[1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:32.560]  and so
[1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:34.560]  prismplanet.tv is no longer a subscriber
[1:25:34.560 --> 1:25:35.560]  it's free
[1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:37.560]  we used to bring in $5 million a year with it
[1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:38.560]  in funding operation
[1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:40.560]  but then later on we don't have the money
[1:25:40.560 --> 1:25:41.560]  to pay the payroll
[1:25:41.560 --> 1:25:42.560]  but that's okay
[1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:44.560]  prismplanet.tv is there
[1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:46.560]  it's a real archive of everything
[1:25:46.560 --> 1:25:48.560]  and I hope you'll find
[1:25:48.560 --> 1:25:50.560]  America Destroyed by Design there
[1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:52.560]  and share it
[1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:54.560]  you know Jack I pray
[1:25:54.560 --> 1:25:56.560]  when it comes upon me to do it
[1:25:56.560 --> 1:25:58.560]  it's not like I got on the show today
[1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:00.560]  first hour and said I'm going to say a prayer later
[1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:02.560]  I was praying during the break
[1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:04.560]  that the Holy Spirit would
[1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:06.560]  help me do a really good job
[1:26:06.560 --> 1:26:08.560]  and I'll just show on screen
[1:26:08.560 --> 1:26:10.560]  which is effective in ways
[1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:12.560]  and so then it just came out of me to pray
[1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:14.560]  but I mean I
[1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:18.560]  part of being human
[1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:20.560]  Jack and I appreciate your call
[1:26:20.560 --> 1:26:22.560]  is that we are imperfect
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:24.560]  the perfection is the imperfectness
[1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:26.560]  and God completes us
[1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:28.560]  and so just because you have a conscience
[1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:30.560]  and see your failings
[1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:32.560]  and want to fix those doesn't mean you're a bad person
[1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:34.560]  and so
[1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:36.560]  the mere fact that you care
[1:26:36.560 --> 1:26:38.560]  and that you say I fail well I fail too
[1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:40.560]  brother
[1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:42.560]  and so I do pray
[1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:44.560]  that God strengthen you
[1:26:44.560 --> 1:26:46.560]  and let you understand that
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:48.560]  you are an imperfect vessel
[1:26:48.560 --> 1:26:50.560]  that God made you
[1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:52.560]  to only be complete when you find God
[1:26:52.560 --> 1:26:54.560]  and so that's part of the process
[1:26:54.560 --> 1:26:56.560]  my friend
[1:26:56.560 --> 1:26:58.560]  alright up next let's talk to Rachel
[1:26:58.560 --> 1:27:00.560]  in Missouri Rachel you're on the air
[1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:02.560]  go ahead
[1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:04.560]  hi there Alex I'm a first time caller
[1:27:04.560 --> 1:27:06.560]  and I just want to say thank you
[1:27:06.560 --> 1:27:08.560]  so much for being our voice
[1:27:08.560 --> 1:27:10.560]  my husband
[1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:12.560]  my kids we're all info warriors
[1:27:12.560 --> 1:27:14.560]  and we totally appreciate you
[1:27:14.560 --> 1:27:16.560]  we were
[1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:18.560]  listening yesterday to your broadcast
[1:27:18.560 --> 1:27:20.560]  about impeachment and calling
[1:27:20.560 --> 1:27:22.560]  for an impeachment provided
[1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:24.560]  so I went ahead and jumped on the phone
[1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:26.560]  to my congressman
[1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:28.560]  and God hit through to his office
[1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:30.560]  and I had asked they said well what are the plans
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:32.560]  are you guys planning on doing anything
[1:27:32.560 --> 1:27:34.560]  he is a republican
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:36.560]  I said are you planning anything
[1:27:36.560 --> 1:27:38.560]  and the person who answered the phone said well
[1:27:38.560 --> 1:27:40.560]  since congress is
[1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:42.560]  basically run by the democrats
[1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:44.560]  impeachment that we would bring up
[1:27:44.560 --> 1:27:46.560]  would be shut down
[1:27:46.560 --> 1:27:48.560]  and I said have there been any calls
[1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:50.560]  and he said well I think there might have been
[1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:52.560]  and I had asked directly well did congressman
[1:27:52.560 --> 1:27:54.560]  Smith did he go ahead and participate
[1:27:54.560 --> 1:27:56.560]  in any of those articles of impeachment
[1:27:56.560 --> 1:27:58.560]  did he raise his hand and say I'm a part
[1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:00.560]  of it
[1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:02.560]  and the person on the telephone said no
[1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:04.560]  no he hasn't
[1:28:04.560 --> 1:28:06.560]  and I think your call
[1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:08.560]  yesterday for people to go ahead
[1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:10.560]  and be more on board
[1:28:10.560 --> 1:28:12.560]  impeachment provided if all of us
[1:28:12.560 --> 1:28:14.560]  call up our representatives in congress
[1:28:14.560 --> 1:28:16.560]  and take part
[1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:18.560]  of you know
[1:28:18.560 --> 1:28:20.560]  our little part here
[1:28:20.560 --> 1:28:22.560]  everybody calls I think it will make a big
[1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:24.560]  difference.
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:26.560]  I agree Rachel don't hang up I want to come back and talk to you more please stay with us
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:28.560]  absolutely
[1:28:28.560 --> 1:28:30.560]  and again I told you when you call
[1:28:30.560 --> 1:28:32.560]  and they're going to go well we don't control congress
[1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:34.560]  it's not about that it's about you're supposed to do it
[1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:36.560]  and then you'll make democrats go on record
[1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:38.560]  supporting the inflation
[1:28:38.560 --> 1:28:40.560]  and the open borders and the crime
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:42.560]  so that we'll get the impeachment after the midterm
[1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:44.560]  and not oh well he's weak
[1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:46.560]  he makes democrats look bad leave him in
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:48.560]  he's destroying the country
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:50.560]  and starving everybody and shot off the pipelines
[1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:52.560]  and oil and gas drilling
[1:28:52.560 --> 1:29:20.560]  so we have to remove him.

[1:30:50.560 --> 1:30:52.560]  thank you all for your support
[1:30:52.560 --> 1:30:54.560]  now take action and get your bottle
[1:30:54.560 --> 1:30:56.560]  of Ultra 12
[1:30:56.560 --> 1:30:58.560]  it was about 25 years ago
[1:30:58.560 --> 1:31:00.560]  that I wanted to expand info war
[1:31:00.560 --> 1:31:02.560]  so I've been on here a couple of years but I only had money
[1:31:02.560 --> 1:31:04.560]  to finance my own
[1:31:04.560 --> 1:31:06.560]  simple little local radio show
[1:31:06.560 --> 1:31:08.560]  and I wanted to hire camera people and I wanted to make films
[1:31:08.560 --> 1:31:10.560]  I wanted to really challenge the world
[1:31:10.560 --> 1:31:12.560]  and it was a t-shirt I designed
[1:31:12.560 --> 1:31:14.560]  the first one mass murderers agree
[1:31:14.560 --> 1:31:16.560]  gun control works
[1:31:16.560 --> 1:31:18.560]  that helped us finance
[1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:20.560]  hiring the first three members of my crew
[1:31:20.560 --> 1:31:22.560]  that's our oldest design and we still sell it
[1:31:22.560 --> 1:31:24.560]  we have that design over 100 others
[1:31:24.560 --> 1:31:26.560]  that will now all be limited editions
[1:31:26.560 --> 1:31:28.560]  because whatever stock we've got in
[1:31:28.560 --> 1:31:30.560]  that's it we're selling everything out
[1:31:30.560 --> 1:31:32.560]  to fund the operation to get rid of inventory
[1:31:32.560 --> 1:31:34.560]  we'll still have some teachers in the future
[1:31:34.560 --> 1:31:36.560]  they'll just be limited editions and short runs
[1:31:36.560 --> 1:31:38.560]  so if you want to get any of these historic shirts
[1:31:38.560 --> 1:31:40.560]  this is your last chance
[1:31:40.560 --> 1:31:42.560]  I almost forgot
[1:31:42.560 --> 1:31:44.560]  I'm calling them all at cost
[1:31:44.560 --> 1:31:46.560]  at infowarstore.com
[1:31:46.560 --> 1:31:48.560]  every ball cap
[1:31:48.560 --> 1:31:50.560]  every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve
[1:31:50.560 --> 1:31:52.560]  every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts
[1:31:52.560 --> 1:31:54.560]  they're all selling at cost
[1:31:54.560 --> 1:31:56.560]  infowarstore.com
[1:31:56.560 --> 1:31:58.560]  the globalists are bombarding us
[1:31:58.560 --> 1:32:00.560]  with propaganda
[1:32:00.560 --> 1:32:02.560]  and with spiritual warfare
[1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:04.560]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food
[1:32:04.560 --> 1:32:06.560]  it's all come out
[1:32:06.560 --> 1:32:08.560]  and they're doing that not because we're weak
[1:32:08.560 --> 1:32:10.560]  but because we're made the image of God
[1:32:10.560 --> 1:32:12.560]  we're the creator and we are
[1:32:12.560 --> 1:32:14.560]  powerful and the social engineers
[1:32:14.560 --> 1:32:16.560]  fear that so much
[1:32:16.560 --> 1:32:18.560]  so that's why I repeat that famous internet
[1:32:18.560 --> 1:32:20.560]  saying that nobody knows who first came up
[1:32:20.560 --> 1:32:22.560]  with the boy, is it true
[1:32:24.560 --> 1:32:26.560]  the propaganda would not be necessary
[1:32:26.560 --> 1:32:28.560]  if the situation
[1:32:28.560 --> 1:32:30.560]  was hopeless
[1:32:30.560 --> 1:32:32.560]  they need all their propaganda and all their lies
[1:32:32.560 --> 1:32:34.560]  and all their evil and all their cultural death
[1:32:34.560 --> 1:32:36.560]  because
[1:32:36.560 --> 1:32:38.560]  they know we are strong
[1:32:38.560 --> 1:32:40.560]  and they know in the end they signed on
[1:32:40.560 --> 1:32:42.560]  the God of this world who is a loser
[1:32:42.560 --> 1:32:44.560]  and that's why it's so important that everybody
[1:32:44.560 --> 1:32:46.560]  keep info wars in the air now more than ever
[1:32:46.560 --> 1:32:48.560]  because even if you don't believe in God
[1:32:48.560 --> 1:32:50.560]  what the globalists are manifesting
[1:32:50.560 --> 1:32:52.560]  and setting up is Jay Cannon
[1:32:52.560 --> 1:32:54.560]  and we are opposing the one world government
[1:32:54.560 --> 1:33:10.560]  and the mark of the beast they just announced
[1:33:24.560 --> 1:33:26.560]  I want to go back to Rachel here in a moment
[1:33:26.560 --> 1:33:28.560]  but I want to be just so clear on this
[1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:30.560]  that when I know I'm right about something
[1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:32.560]  I'm right just like you know you're right
[1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:34.560]  and you know when I say it it's right
[1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:36.560]  you don't have to be a genius
[1:33:36.560 --> 1:33:38.560]  to know this
[1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:40.560]  the republican leadership
[1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:42.560]  bullies and controls
[1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:44.560]  and threatens
[1:33:44.560 --> 1:33:46.560]  anybody that doesn't get in the new world order line
[1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:48.560]  and they pretend like they're against the agenda
[1:33:48.560 --> 1:33:50.560]  and they hate Trump not because he's perfect
[1:33:50.560 --> 1:33:52.560]  they hate Trump
[1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:54.560]  not because he's perfect
[1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:56.560]  but because he was leading in all these
[1:33:56.560 --> 1:33:58.560]  new populace and people that this show
[1:33:58.560 --> 1:34:00.560]  and other broadcasts woke up
[1:34:00.560 --> 1:34:02.560]  and I'll talk about that after the caller leaves
[1:34:02.560 --> 1:34:04.560]  but understanding
[1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:06.560]  where this came from
[1:34:06.560 --> 1:34:08.560]  and where it was born
[1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:10.560]  is beyond critical
[1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:12.560]  it's absolutely important
[1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:14.560]  to understand
[1:34:14.560 --> 1:34:16.560]  and so that's why I said yesterday
[1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:18.560]  and I spent an hour on it
[1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:20.560]  when you
[1:34:20.560 --> 1:34:22.560]  call your congress man or woman
[1:34:22.560 --> 1:34:24.560]  and when you tell them
[1:34:24.560 --> 1:34:26.560]  hey I want you to impeach
[1:34:26.560 --> 1:34:28.560]  they're gonna respond we don't control
[1:34:28.560 --> 1:34:30.560]  the house and senate
[1:34:30.560 --> 1:34:32.560]  well the democrats did that before they won back at the house
[1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:34.560]  and senate why because it's a bully pulpit
[1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:36.560]  in a way even if you don't control the hearings
[1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:38.560]  to be able
[1:34:38.560 --> 1:34:40.560]  to push it out and show
[1:34:40.560 --> 1:34:42.560]  hey they open the border
[1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:44.560]  they violated title 42
[1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:46.560]  in law which the courts say they can't do but they're still doing it
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:48.560]  they are the ones flooding us
[1:34:48.560 --> 1:34:50.560]  with at least 18,000 being housed
[1:34:50.560 --> 1:34:52.560]  today
[1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:54.560]  coming across they think they catch like one out of eight
[1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:56.560]  so do the math
[1:34:56.560 --> 1:34:58.560]  we're talking seven times at least
[1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:00.560]  making it through
[1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:02.560]  it's insane
[1:35:02.560 --> 1:35:04.560]  and so on those issues
[1:35:04.560 --> 1:35:06.560]  you make it a campaign issue
[1:35:06.560 --> 1:35:08.560]  with the impeachment
[1:35:08.560 --> 1:35:10.560]  about the open borders of the treason
[1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:12.560]  and about the inflation shutting off the pipelines
[1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:14.560]  it's cut and dry
[1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:16.560]  it will cause not just a landslide
[1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:18.560]  not just a political
[1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:20.560]  realignment but a
[1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:22.560]  total shift
[1:35:22.560 --> 1:35:24.560]  and Mitch McConnell
[1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:26.560]  and all the rest
[1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:28.560]  of them Kevin McCarthy
[1:35:28.560 --> 1:35:30.560]  know that
[1:35:30.560 --> 1:35:32.560]  and they are
[1:35:32.560 --> 1:35:34.560]  losing the ball game on purpose
[1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:36.560]  because they're CHICOM agents
[1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:38.560]  on record I'm not gonna go into the
[1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:40.560]  50 hours of evidence you know it already
[1:35:40.560 --> 1:35:42.560]  so
[1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:44.560]  what I'm telling you is a default
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:46.560]  no
[1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:48.560]  brainer
[1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:50.560]  it's like in a football game
[1:35:50.560 --> 1:35:52.560]  hey let's put our 11 players on the field
[1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:54.560]  it's not even a discussion
[1:35:54.560 --> 1:35:56.560]  if you don't put players on the field
[1:35:56.560 --> 1:35:58.560]  you don't even participate
[1:35:58.560 --> 1:36:00.560]  and you forfeit the game
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:02.560]  we're not putting players on the field
[1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:04.560]  we got
[1:36:04.560 --> 1:36:06.560]  almost 50 congress people that were republicans
[1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:08.560]  notice now the anti-war democrats all voted
[1:36:08.560 --> 1:36:10.560]  for the 40 billion for Ukraine
[1:36:10.560 --> 1:36:12.560]  we have it's 50 plus
[1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:14.560]  republicans that voted against
[1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:16.560]  but 54 got the number here
[1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:18.560]  54, 53
[1:36:18.560 --> 1:36:20.560]  that voted against this
[1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:22.560]  because they understand it's collapsing our country
[1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:24.560]  and it's a fraud
[1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:26.560]  it's a black hole of money laundering
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:28.560]  and so
[1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:30.560]  when you call these congress people's minions
[1:36:30.560 --> 1:36:32.560]  you say listen
[1:36:32.560 --> 1:36:34.560]  I'm gonna come down to the public event and bullhorn and make a big deal about it
[1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:36.560]  if you don't listen to me
[1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:38.560]  I'll be friendly if you listen
[1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:40.560]  I don't give a rat's ass
[1:36:40.560 --> 1:36:42.560]  I'm not gonna tell you
[1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:44.560]  or what any of these people are gonna tell you
[1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:46.560]  you have a job
[1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:48.560]  to start impeachment over violation of federal law
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:50.560]  of the open border
[1:36:50.560 --> 1:36:52.560]  cut and dry
[1:36:52.560 --> 1:36:54.560]  and cutting off the keystone pipeline
[1:36:54.560 --> 1:36:56.560]  and thousands of other pipelines
[1:36:56.560 --> 1:36:58.560]  and killing tens of thousands
[1:36:58.560 --> 1:37:00.560]  I mean basically almost all
[1:37:00.560 --> 1:37:02.560]  of the oil lease permits
[1:37:02.560 --> 1:37:04.560]  so it's cut and dry
[1:37:04.560 --> 1:37:06.560]  cut and dry, cut and dry, cut and dry
[1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:08.560]  red handed, hand in the cookie jar
[1:37:08.560 --> 1:37:10.560]  done, done, done
[1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:12.560]  it is a political winner
[1:37:12.560 --> 1:37:14.560]  it's like having an all-star team
[1:37:14.560 --> 1:37:16.560]  play
[1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:18.560]  little league football
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:20.560]  it'd be like if you had the best players in the NFL
[1:37:20.560 --> 1:37:22.560]  a hundred of them on a team
[1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:24.560]  playing five-year-olds
[1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:26.560]  there's not even a decision here
[1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:28.560]  total victory is in our hands
[1:37:28.560 --> 1:37:30.560]  but they control the top
[1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:32.560]  so we never get the common sense
[1:37:32.560 --> 1:37:34.560]  we'd have freaking space bases
[1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:36.560]  all the way out past Pluto right now
[1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:38.560]  these people weren't in our way
[1:37:38.560 --> 1:37:40.560]  we'd have life extension, we'd have everything
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:42.560]  they're in our way, get behind me Satan
[1:37:44.560 --> 1:37:46.560]  so when I talk up here
[1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:48.560]  and I should write an article and give points to this
[1:37:48.560 --> 1:37:50.560]  this is understanding politics now it works
[1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:52.560]  you're gonna call
[1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:54.560]  and they're gonna say well we don't have control
[1:37:56.560 --> 1:37:58.560]  and that'll make him a victim, no it won't
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:00.560]  you have a job because he's sabotaging
[1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:02.560]  the country and destroying it
[1:38:02.560 --> 1:38:04.560]  yeah he's a puppet, yeah he's got dementia
[1:38:04.560 --> 1:38:06.560]  that run him, Obama
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:08.560]  the third Obama administration
[1:38:08.560 --> 1:38:10.560]  that stole the election has this puppet
[1:38:10.560 --> 1:38:12.560]  and so we should say impeach Obama
[1:38:12.560 --> 1:38:14.560]  it should be called the impeachment
[1:38:14.560 --> 1:38:16.560]  of Barack Obama's rogue government
[1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:20.560]  everything I'm saying is total victory
[1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:22.560]  every bit of this will win
[1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:24.560]  every bit of this is true
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:26.560]  this is absolute
[1:38:26.560 --> 1:38:28.560]  total victory in stopping them
[1:38:28.560 --> 1:38:30.560]  in your hands now
[1:38:30.560 --> 1:38:32.560]  that's why they listen to this show and pull their hair out
[1:38:32.560 --> 1:38:34.560]  they're like this guy's got our number
[1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:36.560]  I'll use a Star Wars analogy of episode 4
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:38.560]  the Death Star Codes
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:40.560]  stolen at the battle of Yavin
[1:38:40.560 --> 1:38:42.560]  hundreds of thousands died again
[1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:44.560]  it doesn't matter
[1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:46.560]  you now have the codes to the reactor shaft
[1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:48.560]  you fire the torpedoes down and it blows up
[1:38:50.560 --> 1:38:52.560]  and I'm in the trench with you
[1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:54.560]  and the Republicans won't even load
[1:38:54.560 --> 1:38:56.560]  missiles on to the freaking X-Wings
[1:38:56.560 --> 1:38:58.560]  load the missiles
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:00.560]  fire the missiles politically
[1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:02.560]  destroy the enemy
[1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:04.560]  politically loving
[1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:06.560]  nonviolent way
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:10.560]  that's where we are
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:12.560]  and they know it
[1:39:12.560 --> 1:39:14.560]  can you imagine
[1:39:14.560 --> 1:39:16.560]  impeachment hearings about maybe formula
[1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:18.560]  impeachment hearings about inflation
[1:39:18.560 --> 1:39:20.560]  impeachment hearings about Keystone Pipeline
[1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:22.560]  impeachment hearings about giant human trafficking
[1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:24.560]  of kidnapped children
[1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:26.560]  giant human trafficking of kidnapped children
[1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:28.560]  game over
[1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:30.560]  game over
[1:39:30.560 --> 1:39:32.560]  game over
[1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:34.560]  game over game over game over
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:36.560]  game over game over and we're sitting here
[1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:38.560]  with the keys
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:40.560]  to protect our children
[1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:42.560]  with the keys to have our future
[1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:44.560]  with the keys to prosperity
[1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:46.560]  and we won't even load the torpedoes
[1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:48.560]  on the X-Wing
[1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:54.560]  we won't even load the ship to attack
[1:39:58.560 --> 1:40:00.560]  our enemies are weak
[1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:02.560]  our enemies are blackmailing each other
[1:40:02.560 --> 1:40:04.560]  our enemies are inbred and satanic
[1:40:04.560 --> 1:40:06.560]  they are scum
[1:40:12.560 --> 1:40:14.560]  what does that make us if we don't do anything about them
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:16.560]  so yes I know what they're going to do when you call
[1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:18.560]  and you say listen here
[1:40:18.560 --> 1:40:20.560]  people are starving
[1:40:20.560 --> 1:40:22.560]  they're smuggling children across
[1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:24.560]  they've turned the pipelines off
[1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:26.560]  I mean what if Biden just turns the goddamn
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:28.560]  excuse me lord forgive me
[1:40:28.560 --> 1:40:30.560]  what if Biden just turns the electricity off
[1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:32.560]  would we do any oh sorry
[1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:34.560]  he turned the electricity off
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:36.560]  we're not in power yet
[1:40:36.560 --> 1:40:38.560]  what are you talking about
[1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:40.560]  it'll make democrats line up and support
[1:40:40.560 --> 1:40:42.560]  cutting off the pipelines
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:44.560]  it'll make them line up and support the human smuggling
[1:40:44.560 --> 1:40:46.560]  it'll put them on the hot seat
[1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:48.560]  it'll put them in the star chamber
[1:40:48.560 --> 1:40:50.560]  it'll put their ass in the fire
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:52.560]  and thank god
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:54.560]  Rachel gets it
[1:40:54.560 --> 1:40:56.560]  and Rachel called
[1:40:56.560 --> 1:40:58.560]  and everybody else should
[1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:02.560]  to let them know
[1:41:02.560 --> 1:41:04.560]  that we are watching
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:06.560]  and we know what they've done
[1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:08.560]  and we want to know who's going to vote for impeachment
[1:41:08.560 --> 1:41:10.560]  and who isn't because if you don't do it
[1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:12.560]  you're part of the problem
[1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:14.560]  and Rachel go ahead
[1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:16.560]  Alex it's brilliant
[1:41:16.560 --> 1:41:18.560]  it really is because like I was saying
[1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:20.560]  my husband and I we were talking about what can we do
[1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:22.560]  we could hold up signs
[1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:24.560]  outside of Walmart
[1:41:24.560 --> 1:41:26.560]  but calling our representatives
[1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:28.560]  and urging other
[1:41:28.560 --> 1:41:30.560]  info wars listeners to do the same
[1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:32.560]  and be on it
[1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:34.560]  I mean just because my representative
[1:41:34.560 --> 1:41:36.560]  says he's a republican
[1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:38.560]  but he hasn't done anything to go ahead
[1:41:38.560 --> 1:41:40.560]  and support the people that he represents
[1:41:40.560 --> 1:41:42.560]  we're all
[1:41:42.560 --> 1:41:44.560]  we're all in this right now
[1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:46.560]  with the sky high inflation
[1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:48.560]  with the gas prices going
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:50.560]  not so
[1:41:50.560 --> 1:41:52.560]  I mean what are our representatives
[1:41:52.560 --> 1:41:54.560]  doing for us
[1:41:54.560 --> 1:41:56.560]  that piece of garbage stole the election
[1:41:56.560 --> 1:41:58.560]  and now we're going to remove him through impeachment
[1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:00.560]  and I'm telling you if they bring up particles
[1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:02.560]  and really put forward evidence
[1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:04.560]  he'll be removed the democrats are sick of this
[1:42:04.560 --> 1:42:06.560]  the average democrat doesn't want to destroy their families
[1:42:06.560 --> 1:42:08.560]  the leadership
[1:42:08.560 --> 1:42:10.560]  a sitting duck
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:12.560]  you are brilliant
[1:42:12.560 --> 1:42:14.560]  I think this is a wonderful
[1:42:14.560 --> 1:42:16.560]  wonderful wonderful idea
[1:42:16.560 --> 1:42:18.560]  everybody has to get on board and start calling
[1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:20.560]  up their representatives
[1:42:20.560 --> 1:42:22.560]  God bless you Rachel keep doing it keep doing it
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:24.560]  thank you but I gotta be honest here
[1:42:24.560 --> 1:42:26.560]  if I'm
[1:42:26.560 --> 1:42:28.560]  being held underwater I'm gonna fight
[1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:30.560]  who's holding me underwater go for air it's not
[1:42:30.560 --> 1:42:32.560]  survival is not brilliant
[1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:34.560]  they have a job this guy
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:36.560]  is involved in treason
[1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:38.560]  do the hunter laptop and side distractions
[1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:40.560]  and you cut the justice department
[1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:42.560]  out of it and you use congress
[1:42:42.560 --> 1:42:44.560]  and you go with impeachment
[1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:46.560]  and you may not getting this time
[1:42:46.560 --> 1:42:48.560]  but you will expose who's
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:50.560]  behind it with the biggest bully pull up there
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:52.560]  but the republican leadership wants
[1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:54.560]  to suppress you because they're part of the problem
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:04.560]  and we begin a lot of crypto donations

[1:48:04.560 --> 1:48:06.560]  to fly around and our listeners
[1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:08.560]  showed up of the hundreds of thousands
[1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:10.560]  that were there and a third of the people
[1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:12.560]  were wearing infowars.com t-shirts
[1:48:12.560 --> 1:48:14.560]  and the left just went
[1:48:14.560 --> 1:48:16.560]  apoplectic, they didn't understand
[1:48:16.560 --> 1:48:18.560]  that we understood the grassroots
[1:48:18.560 --> 1:48:20.560]  we believed in America
[1:48:20.560 --> 1:48:22.560]  we believed in every race color and creed
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:24.560]  and that crowd of black
[1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:26.560]  white, Hispanic, old, young
[1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:28.560]  male, female, gay, straight
[1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:30.560]  that diverse crowd made them
[1:48:30.560 --> 1:48:32.560]  just panicked
[1:48:32.560 --> 1:48:34.560]  and all their attacks actually made it
[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:36.560]  stronger in many ways
[1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:40.560]  and that's why
[1:48:40.560 --> 1:48:42.560]  there's a symbiotic relationship here
[1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:44.560]  in a real big win-win
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:46.560]  if you'll just listen to me and decide to do it
[1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:48.560]  because there are millions of people listening right now
[1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:50.560]  and if you would just decide
[1:48:50.560 --> 1:48:52.560]  to call up
[1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:54.560]  the toll-free number or go online

[1:48:56.560 --> 1:48:58.560]  shirt or another infowars shirt

[1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:02.560]  at cost, the infowars
[1:49:02.560 --> 1:49:04.560]  Alex Jones' Right shirt is being sold for

[1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:08.560]  you'd get a great shirt that wakes people up
[1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:10.560]  you'd meet like-minded people in red areas
[1:49:10.560 --> 1:49:12.560]  that your dinner bought for you probably
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:14.560]  and meet your best new best friend

[1:49:16.560 --> 1:49:18.560]  wearing an infowars shirt
[1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:20.560]  if everybody would just go

[1:49:28.560 --> 1:49:30.560]  your niece, your nephew
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:32.560]  it would fund us
[1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:34.560]  but more importantly
[1:49:34.560 --> 1:49:36.560]  it's something that shows
[1:49:36.560 --> 1:49:38.560]  a symbol of freedom, a uniform
[1:49:38.560 --> 1:49:40.560]  out there in the real world

[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:50.560]  and then we have
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:52.560]  a designer one that's of a super fancy fabric
[1:49:52.560 --> 1:49:54.560]  made in America that costs us like
[1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:56.560]  $18 to make, we're selling that for $40
[1:49:56.560 --> 1:49:58.560]  there'll be that designer's shirt

[1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:10.560]  with the designer's shirt and this shirt

[1:50:20.560 --> 1:50:22.560]  to the truth and to spread the word

[1:51:20.560 --> 1:51:22.560]  we got so many great callers
[1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:24.560]  been holding a long time
[1:51:24.560 --> 1:51:26.560]  let's talk to Kim in Arkansas
[1:51:26.560 --> 1:51:28.560]  Kim, thanks for holding it on the air
[1:51:28.560 --> 1:51:30.560]  Alejandro, powerful show
[1:51:30.560 --> 1:51:32.560]  I'm fired up
[1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:34.560]  the force is with us brother
[1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:36.560]  I love you, what's up
[1:51:36.560 --> 1:51:38.560]  Revelation 15
[1:51:38.560 --> 1:51:40.560]  tells us that the kingdoms of this world
[1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:42.560]  have become
[1:51:42.560 --> 1:51:44.560]  the kingdoms of our Lord
[1:51:44.560 --> 1:51:46.560]  and of His Christ
[1:51:46.560 --> 1:51:48.560]  this theme is repeated
[1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:50.560]  all throughout Scripture
[1:51:50.560 --> 1:51:52.560]  now
[1:51:52.560 --> 1:51:54.560]  if His reign has no end
[1:51:54.560 --> 1:51:56.560]  and if His kingdom
[1:51:56.560 --> 1:51:58.560]  began
[1:51:58.560 --> 1:52:00.560]  in His public ministry
[1:52:00.560 --> 1:52:02.560]  in AD 70
[1:52:02.560 --> 1:52:04.560]  and
[1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:06.560]  if His kingdom was consummated
[1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:08.560]  at the fall
[1:52:08.560 --> 1:52:10.560]  in desolation
[1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:12.560]  of the old covenant system
[1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:14.560]  then that means
[1:52:14.560 --> 1:52:16.560]  that
[1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:18.560]  His kingdom reigns
[1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:20.560]  it can never be destroyed
[1:52:20.560 --> 1:52:22.560]  and that means
[1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:24.560]  that we're going to win
[1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:26.560]  that's right, God has already won
[1:52:26.560 --> 1:52:28.560]  the devil just wants to take a bunch of people with him
[1:52:28.560 --> 1:52:30.560]  you know
[1:52:30.560 --> 1:52:32.560]  absolutely
[1:52:32.560 --> 1:52:34.560]  and I think that
[1:52:34.560 --> 1:52:36.560]  if
[1:52:36.560 --> 1:52:38.560]  His children would
[1:52:38.560 --> 1:52:40.560]  research the Scripture
[1:52:40.560 --> 1:52:42.560]  and realize that
[1:52:42.560 --> 1:52:44.560]  that
[1:52:44.560 --> 1:52:46.560]  the destruction
[1:52:46.560 --> 1:52:48.560]  of the old covenant system
[1:52:48.560 --> 1:52:50.560]  is the key
[1:52:50.560 --> 1:52:52.560]  we're in a new kingdom, we're in the new covenant
[1:52:52.560 --> 1:52:54.560]  and believers don't know their game plan
[1:52:54.560 --> 1:52:56.560]  but our enemy
[1:52:56.560 --> 1:52:58.560]  knows God's game plan
[1:52:58.560 --> 1:53:00.560]  that's right and follows it
[1:53:00.560 --> 1:53:02.560]  and notice
[1:53:02.560 --> 1:53:04.560]  Titus sacked Jerusalem
[1:53:04.560 --> 1:53:06.560]  in AD 70
[1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:08.560]  before you're dead to these young people
[1:53:08.560 --> 1:53:10.560]  not a stone will be left
[1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:12.560]  on top of the other
[1:53:12.560 --> 1:53:14.560]  that was a symbol of the old covenant being destroyed right there
[1:53:14.560 --> 1:53:16.560]  He told
[1:53:16.560 --> 1:53:18.560]  all of His generation
[1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:20.560]  and His ministry
[1:53:20.560 --> 1:53:22.560]  this generation will not pass away
[1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:24.560]  until all
[1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:26.560]  of these things are fulfilled
[1:53:26.560 --> 1:53:28.560]  what were all of those things
[1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:30.560]  all of the Old Testament
[1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:32.560]  prophetic words
[1:53:32.560 --> 1:53:34.560]  now His kingdom began
[1:53:34.560 --> 1:53:36.560]  in AD 70
[1:53:36.560 --> 1:53:38.560]  Alex, you said it today
[1:53:38.560 --> 1:53:40.560]  we are
[1:53:40.560 --> 1:53:42.560]  winning God's kingdom
[1:53:42.560 --> 1:53:44.560]  Jesus' kingdom can never be destroyed
[1:53:44.560 --> 1:53:46.560]  oh it's not even a discussion
[1:53:46.560 --> 1:53:48.560]  it's not even a debate, God made the world
[1:53:48.560 --> 1:53:50.560]  pardon me
[1:53:50.560 --> 1:53:52.560]  God made the world, God made consciousness
[1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:54.560]  exactly, it's all a test
[1:53:54.560 --> 1:53:56.560]  it's all a big joke for the Satanist thing
[1:53:56.560 --> 1:53:58.560]  and the devil knows that
[1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:00.560]  I think when
[1:54:00.560 --> 1:54:02.560]  we understand that we're in God's kingdom
[1:54:02.560 --> 1:54:04.560]  then everything that you've been revealing
[1:54:04.560 --> 1:54:06.560]  to us for decades
[1:54:06.560 --> 1:54:08.560]  comes into perspective
[1:54:08.560 --> 1:54:10.560]  because here's the deal, I believe
[1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:12.560]  according to scripture and what I've experienced
[1:54:12.560 --> 1:54:14.560]  in my life, I believe that
[1:54:14.560 --> 1:54:16.560]  sometime these people
[1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:18.560]  sold out
[1:54:18.560 --> 1:54:20.560]  whoever or whatever this evil force is
[1:54:20.560 --> 1:54:22.560]  and once they did that
[1:54:22.560 --> 1:54:24.560]  I think they're locked in
[1:54:24.560 --> 1:54:26.560]  now they realize they can't get out
[1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:28.560]  they've got to destroy us
[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:30.560]  before they're destroyed
[1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:32.560]  oh that's exactly how it works brother
[1:54:34.560 --> 1:54:36.560]  so I just want to encourage you
[1:54:36.560 --> 1:54:38.560]  and everybody
[1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:40.560]  you're powerful brother
[1:54:40.560 --> 1:54:42.560]  you're the greatest voice on planet earth
[1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:44.560]  I say that to everybody
[1:54:44.560 --> 1:54:46.560]  and you're going to go down in history
[1:54:46.560 --> 1:54:48.560]  if believers realize
[1:54:48.560 --> 1:54:50.560]  that we're winning
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:52.560]  and if they'll get their information
[1:54:52.560 --> 1:54:54.560]  if God not these
[1:54:54.560 --> 1:54:56.560]  big time preachers
[1:54:56.560 --> 1:54:58.560]  who have the Rothschild
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:00.560]  are behind
[1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:02.560]  the John Darby
[1:55:02.560 --> 1:55:04.560]  dispensational
[1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:06.560]  rapture of the church
[1:55:06.560 --> 1:55:08.560]  no you're right they are
[1:55:08.560 --> 1:55:10.560]  and again people say well wait it's all predestined
[1:55:10.560 --> 1:55:12.560]  no there's predestined plans
[1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:14.560]  but it's up to us
[1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:16.560]  it's kind of like the choose your adventure books when you're a kid
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:18.560]  where there's four or five ways it can end
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:20.560]  and that's literally
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:22.560]  free will God already has a plan
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:24.560]  it's going to be fulfilled the question is
[1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:26.560]  how bad is it going to be going through this
[1:55:26.560 --> 1:55:28.560]  or can we lessen it
[1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:30.560]  like none of it got 100 year reprieve
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:32.560]  and you know we're all synced up here understanding
[1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:34.560]  God's kingdom began in 70 AD
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:36.560]  the old covenant was gone
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:38.560]  and that is
[1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:40.560]  where we are in the new covenant
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:42.560]  and then this is the big test there'll be one more test
[1:55:42.560 --> 1:55:44.560]  after the thousand year reign
[1:55:44.560 --> 1:55:46.560]  and that's where we are God bless you sir
[1:55:46.560 --> 1:55:48.560]  and I appreciate your call
[1:55:48.560 --> 1:55:50.560]  I'm going to go to another caller
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:52.560]  we only got two minutes to go on the break so I'm going to
[1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:54.560]  go to Holy Stride
[1:55:54.560 --> 1:55:56.560]  in California welcome Holy Stride
[1:55:56.560 --> 1:55:58.560]  Alex thank you for taking my call
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:00.560]  I loved your show
[1:56:00.560 --> 1:56:02.560]  been listening for a long time
[1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:04.560]  I want to
[1:56:04.560 --> 1:56:06.560]  I want to add kind of what the last caller said
[1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:08.560]  he kind of beat me to it
[1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:10.560]  it seems like
[1:56:10.560 --> 1:56:12.560]  everything you've said is a lot of it
[1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:14.560]  most of it has happened now and people
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:16.560]  are so scared and fearful of what
[1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:18.560]  can come
[1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:20.560]  based on you being right and I think it's obvious
[1:56:20.560 --> 1:56:22.560]  now and many people I know personally
[1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:24.560]  when I talk to them about this
[1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:26.560]  they don't really want to hear it
[1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:28.560]  because they don't know what to do about it
[1:56:28.560 --> 1:56:30.560]  and they're scared and I think that that comes
[1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:32.560]  no they're right they can't
[1:56:32.560 --> 1:56:34.560]  beat it and God can beat it
[1:56:34.560 --> 1:56:36.560]  the answer is God
[1:56:36.560 --> 1:56:38.560]  yeah but I agree
[1:56:38.560 --> 1:56:40.560]  totally I just wanted to stay with that
[1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:42.560]  that maybe perhaps
[1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:44.560]  there has to be in my
[1:56:44.560 --> 1:56:46.560]  opinion some sort of
[1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:48.560]  spiritual oneness
[1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:50.560]  and correct biblical theology
[1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:52.560]  taught to the masses and people
[1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:54.560]  have to hear it because when they hear it
[1:56:54.560 --> 1:56:56.560]  and understand the scripture there's many Christians
[1:56:56.560 --> 1:56:58.560]  hold on don't hang up Holy Stride I'm going to come back
[1:56:58.560 --> 1:57:00.560]  to you in two minutes we start the next hour
[1:57:00.560 --> 1:57:02.560]  well here's the good part about it it's all going to
[1:57:02.560 --> 1:57:04.560]  get fulfilled anti Christ world government
[1:57:04.560 --> 1:57:06.560]  mass extermination and so people are going to have
[1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:08.560]  to get the real God because that's all
[1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:10.560]  they got I mean folks you will
[1:57:10.560 --> 1:57:12.560]  have nothing you will own nothing
[1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:14.560]  they are this is all going to go down
[1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:16.560]  but it's okay because they lose
[1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:18.560]  they get
[1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:20.560]  a very short period you can debate
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:22.560]  how long a year or two years
[1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:24.560]  it's going to be bad you're just seeing the
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:26.560]  beta test now but it's over after that
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:28.560]  alright
[1:57:28.560 --> 1:57:30.560]  so understand that
[1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:32.560]  understand ladies and gentlemen the only way you win
[1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:34.560]  is gutting up realizing you're going to have to
[1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:36.560]  take your licks I'm going to have to take them
[1:57:36.560 --> 1:57:38.560]  you're going to have to take them
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:40.560]  they're probably going to chop my head off folks
[1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:42.560]  it's fine I'll be in Jesus' arms
[1:57:42.560 --> 1:58:10.560]  right back
[1:58:10.560 --> 1:58:15.560]  on
[1:58:15.560 --> 1:58:38.560]  the
[1:58:38.560 --> 1:58:47.120]  cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RFID, camera, EMP, weather, and even GPS today.
[1:58:47.120 --> 1:58:52.640]  I designed over 200 t-shirts the last 25 years, and we have some of those original designs
[1:58:52.640 --> 1:58:54.960]  still for sale at infoworkstore.com.
[1:58:54.960 --> 1:58:55.960]  These are real classics.
[1:58:55.960 --> 1:59:00.760]  But, ladies and gentlemen, they're all about to be limited edition because we're selling
[1:59:00.760 --> 1:59:01.960]  out of them.
[1:59:01.960 --> 1:59:06.720]  They're about to be history, and we're selling out of the hoodies, the ball caps, the t-shirts,
[1:59:06.720 --> 1:59:12.160]  all these amazing designs at cost infoworkstore.com, except for this fundraiser shirt that is
[1:59:12.160 --> 1:59:13.680]  a real hit, and people love it.
[1:59:13.680 --> 1:59:14.680]  It's $24.95.
[1:59:14.680 --> 1:59:18.600]  Alex Jones is right on the front, the Red Thunderbolt, and then again, on the back,
[1:59:18.600 --> 1:59:20.600]  a big bolt, infowars.com.
[1:59:20.600 --> 1:59:25.560]  Exercise your First Amendment, don't let the leftist and the globalist bully silence you
[1:59:25.560 --> 1:59:28.200]  and fund the info war at the same time.
[1:59:28.200 --> 1:59:32.560]  There is not a more politically incorrect shirt that sends a stronger message of freedom,
[1:59:32.560 --> 1:59:36.920]  resistance to the new world order than the Alex Jones was right shirt, exclusively available
[1:59:36.920 --> 1:59:37.920]  at infowarsstore.com.
[1:59:37.920 --> 1:59:41.160]  And again, this shirt is limited edition as well.
[1:59:41.160 --> 1:59:45.560]  We're doing one more run, and then no more, infowarsstore.com.
[1:59:45.560 --> 2:00:11.560]  Here's today.
[2:00:11.560 --> 2:00:19.560]  A lot of people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs, which by any decent standard,
[2:00:19.560 --> 2:00:21.560]  they ought not to enjoy.
[2:00:21.560 --> 2:00:24.560]  I have sure better starve from the beginning.
[2:00:24.560 --> 2:00:29.560]  I have sure better starve from the beginning.
[2:00:29.560 --> 2:00:35.560]  I have sure better starve from the beginning.
[2:00:35.560 --> 2:00:40.560]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[2:00:40.560 --> 2:00:43.560]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[2:00:43.560 --> 2:00:47.560]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[2:00:47.560 --> 2:00:53.560]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[2:00:53.560 --> 2:00:54.560]  Pediatric.
[2:00:54.560 --> 2:00:58.560]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated
[2:00:58.560 --> 2:01:01.560]  with improved behavior and mental performance.
[2:01:01.560 --> 2:01:06.560]  A ride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[2:01:06.560 --> 2:01:11.560]  Now the government had the right under U.S. law to conduct secret testing on the American public
[2:01:11.560 --> 2:01:13.560]  under a specific condition.
[2:01:13.560 --> 2:01:17.560]  I have to work the dark side over the last 10 times in the shadows.
[2:01:17.560 --> 2:01:21.560]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[2:01:21.560 --> 2:01:25.560]  Well, join me, and I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to see.
[2:01:25.560 --> 2:01:28.560]  There's a need for a new world order.
[2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:33.560]  Someday, in the next few years,
[2:01:33.560 --> 2:01:36.560]  the solution will emerge.
[2:02:03.560 --> 2:02:08.560]  This is the end of this video.
[2:02:38.560 --> 2:03:06.760]  I am now completely banned.
[2:03:06.760 --> 2:03:14.840]  I want them shut down, I want them silent, I want them muted, I think they are horrible
[2:03:14.840 --> 2:03:15.840]  for our society.
[2:03:15.840 --> 2:03:17.840]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[2:03:17.840 --> 2:03:22.400]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can
[2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:23.680]  you ban this person?
[2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:27.680]  These are very extreme individuals and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists
[2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:30.920]  and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them.
[2:03:30.920 --> 2:03:34.720]  Basically they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous is what Facebook is saying.
[2:03:34.720 --> 2:03:38.320]  Those individuals include people like right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:43.640]  Organizations like Media Matters have pointed out consistently how Alex Jones and other
[2:03:43.640 --> 2:03:50.200]  info wars pages had just simply circumvented any ban by starting a different account or
[2:03:50.200 --> 2:03:51.200]  going on Instagram.
[2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:55.440]  If you don't like someone on Facebook, don't follow them, it's not that hard to figure
[2:03:55.440 --> 2:03:56.440]  out.
[2:03:56.440 --> 2:03:59.400]  Facebook, are you going to do something about the liberals who call me the n-word?
[2:03:59.400 --> 2:04:03.840]  No, because big tech is only interested in going after conservatives.
[2:04:03.840 --> 2:04:05.440]  You know, the really dangerous ones.
[2:04:05.440 --> 2:04:08.520]  Dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[2:04:08.520 --> 2:04:13.000]  President Trump retweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice and a brief video by Infowars Millie
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:17.560]  Weaver, social media's hall monitor, Frank Stelter, was not very happy about it.
[2:04:17.560 --> 2:04:21.040]  He is promoting the same alternative universe as Infowars.
[2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:25.240]  Back to your point though about the Infowars presidency, I want to know and I tweeted this
[2:04:25.240 --> 2:04:29.320]  all the day, what is the difference right at this point between Trump's Twitter feed
[2:04:29.320 --> 2:04:31.000]  and infowars.com?
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:33.680]  Infowars content is useful to him.
[2:04:33.680 --> 2:04:35.920]  Infowars personalities align with them.
[2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:39.920]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted, I think they are horrible
[2:04:39.920 --> 2:04:40.920]  for our society.
[2:04:40.920 --> 2:04:45.400]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[2:04:45.400 --> 2:04:53.080]  Don't worry, these people aren't terrifying or anything.
[2:04:53.080 --> 2:04:58.920]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[2:04:58.920 --> 2:05:03.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ultra 12, the highest quality B12 you are going to find on the market,

[2:05:08.200 --> 2:05:13.120]  Now in the next 45 seconds, I don't have time to get into vitamin B12 but do your own research

[2:05:29.720 --> 2:05:30.720]  changer.
[2:05:30.720 --> 2:05:37.200]  Infowarsstore.com has Ultra 12 back in stock and despite the fact it's back in stock, despite
[2:05:37.200 --> 2:05:41.920]  the fact it's sold very quickly, it is 40% off for a limited time.

[2:06:01.760 --> 2:06:16.760]  From the front lines, from the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:16.760 --> 2:06:26.760]  And there's nowhere I want to be better than the front lines of the information war.
[2:06:26.760 --> 2:06:27.760]  He's making some really good points.
[2:06:27.760 --> 2:06:32.480]  We'll go back to him and then everybody in the order their calls are received here on
[2:06:32.480 --> 2:06:34.360]  this live Friday the 13th transmission.
[2:06:34.360 --> 2:06:37.200]  All right, go ahead.
[2:06:37.200 --> 2:06:38.200]  He just dropped.
[2:06:38.200 --> 2:06:39.200]  I was going right back to him.
[2:06:39.200 --> 2:06:40.200]  Okay.
[2:06:40.200 --> 2:06:41.200]  Well, that's all right.
[2:06:41.200 --> 2:06:42.200]  Good to have you call.
[2:06:42.200 --> 2:06:43.200]  Appreciate that.
[2:06:43.200 --> 2:06:44.200]  Daniel in North Carolina.
[2:06:44.200 --> 2:06:45.200]  Daniel, welcome.
[2:06:45.200 --> 2:06:51.680]  Hey, Alex, I wanted to start off first by thanking you for coming in and bringing the
[2:06:51.680 --> 2:06:53.560]  truth every day.
[2:06:53.560 --> 2:06:57.840]  And even if that's what God called God called you to do and that's your self preservation,
[2:06:57.840 --> 2:07:01.800]  you made the choice to crawl through it every day and I appreciate that and we all need
[2:07:01.800 --> 2:07:02.800]  it.
[2:07:02.800 --> 2:07:03.800]  You're the only one we can come to.
[2:07:03.800 --> 2:07:05.200]  Well, God bless you brother.
[2:07:05.200 --> 2:07:09.040]  I want you to know that being through this has been great actually.
[2:07:09.040 --> 2:07:12.880]  It's been painful, but it's made me a better man so I want listeners to know persecution
[2:07:12.880 --> 2:07:16.440]  when we're doing the right thing only becomes sweet in the end.
[2:07:16.440 --> 2:07:18.960]  It's it's it's it's it's better sweet brother.
[2:07:18.960 --> 2:07:22.200]  So I get to talk to you and to talk to so many other beautiful souls.
[2:07:22.200 --> 2:07:28.480]  So I appreciate you Daniel from my topic today will be cultural appropriation.
[2:07:28.480 --> 2:07:33.520]  I vote that it's a good thing that it forged generational peace treaties in the past and
[2:07:33.520 --> 2:07:37.160]  that's the only way the different cultures and ethnicities would know what they know
[2:07:37.160 --> 2:07:38.600]  about each other today.
[2:07:38.600 --> 2:07:42.520]  That's what the melting pot is exactly and they're saying the melting pots bad because
[2:07:42.520 --> 2:07:46.520]  they don't want us to come together and that's the only way we can do it.
[2:07:46.520 --> 2:07:50.360]  If they got friends in high places, we need friends in low places and they don't want
[2:07:50.360 --> 2:07:53.200]  us to do that do that.
[2:07:53.200 --> 2:07:54.800]  That's beautiful brother.
[2:07:54.800 --> 2:07:57.120]  What else is on your mind?
[2:07:57.120 --> 2:07:59.080]  Well, oh, I thought on news.
[2:07:59.080 --> 2:08:01.400]  I haven't heard it from y'all today.
[2:08:01.400 --> 2:08:04.560]  Some Russian ships apparently acquired Ukrainian grain.
[2:08:04.560 --> 2:08:08.400]  They've been shipping it around, but they've been denied port to port to port.
[2:08:08.400 --> 2:08:12.880]  I didn't see that and I think I see you guys in video, I forgot to ask for it on the list
[2:08:12.880 --> 2:08:16.640]  in China and all over the world, a caller called in about this yesterday, so I looked
[2:08:16.640 --> 2:08:17.640]  it up.
[2:08:17.640 --> 2:08:19.120]  I mean, I'd seen it, but it was a big deal.
[2:08:19.120 --> 2:08:20.480]  I should have made a big deal about it.
[2:08:20.480 --> 2:08:24.840]  Did you know they're blocking African food because African produces a lot, Latin American
[2:08:24.840 --> 2:08:26.720]  food and a bunch of others.
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:29.160]  And as you said, claiming it has COVID.
[2:08:29.160 --> 2:08:35.720]  So they test the lettuce, which is a false test, you know, it's like the Zimbabwe president.
[2:08:35.720 --> 2:08:42.160]  Remember, he tested a donkey and three different fruits and papaya and some other fruit and
[2:08:42.160 --> 2:08:45.120]  they're like a vegetable and they all came up false positive.
[2:08:45.120 --> 2:08:47.920]  They're blocking food shipments claiming it has COVID.
[2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:51.080]  I mean, it's insane.
[2:08:51.080 --> 2:08:54.720]  Well, it probably won't last much longer.
[2:08:54.720 --> 2:08:59.200]  I'm pretty sure most people are tired of it.
[2:08:59.200 --> 2:09:00.200]  We are brother.
[2:09:00.200 --> 2:09:01.200]  God bless you, Daniel.
[2:09:01.200 --> 2:09:02.200]  Yeah, let's roll this.
[2:09:02.200 --> 2:09:06.440]  I think this is Chinese, but I've got the news articles where China is testing the food,
[2:09:06.440 --> 2:09:08.720]  won't feed people and saying it has COVID.
[2:09:08.720 --> 2:09:11.840]  I mean, well, a virus dies in seconds in the sun.
[2:09:11.840 --> 2:09:15.280]  The damn head of lettuce don't have COVID.
[2:09:15.280 --> 2:09:20.640]  But I mean, it's all about shutting everything down.
[2:09:20.640 --> 2:09:21.640]  You'll have nothing.
[2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:22.640]  You'll own nothing.
[2:09:22.640 --> 2:09:24.480]  They told you, go ahead and go ahead and play with audio.
[2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:25.480]  Here it is.
[2:09:25.480 --> 2:09:38.960]  He's in his radio listeners.
[2:09:38.960 --> 2:09:40.960]  He's in his stupid hazmat suit.
[2:09:40.960 --> 2:09:46.360]  He's got a communist armband on and he's testing ahead of lettuce.
[2:09:46.360 --> 2:09:47.440]  He's got a cucumber there.
[2:09:47.440 --> 2:09:49.880]  He's been tested as well.
[2:09:49.880 --> 2:09:50.880]  And celery.
[2:09:50.880 --> 2:09:51.880]  There's nothing more evil.
[2:09:51.880 --> 2:09:56.680]  And he goes, oh my gosh, it's COVID positive.
[2:09:56.680 --> 2:10:00.800]  Again, COVID's real, folks, but it's not your lettuce.
[2:10:00.800 --> 2:10:03.320]  How do you say, God?
[2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:08.640]  How do you say, God?
[2:10:08.640 --> 2:10:10.160]  This is all a political hysteria.
[2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:13.840]  It distracts you from what the globalists are doing.
[2:10:13.840 --> 2:10:16.800]  And they're bringing the medical ID, they're tracking everything you do, that's all this
[2:10:16.800 --> 2:10:17.800]  is.
[2:10:17.800 --> 2:10:22.800]  Oh, look, the head of lettuce is positive for COVID.
[2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:26.680]  You can't trust anybody but the government and the big corporations that are raping you.
[2:10:26.680 --> 2:10:30.360]  You can't have children, they can't.
[2:10:30.360 --> 2:10:35.880]  You can't fly on a public plane, they can fly private.
[2:10:35.880 --> 2:10:39.040]  And next he moves on to the evil zucchini.
[2:10:39.040 --> 2:10:46.440]  Yeah, Tanzanian president, they killed him right after this, he's a medical doctor.
[2:10:46.440 --> 2:10:53.320]  Kids coronavirus, kids after animal test, goat, sheep, a bunch of fruits and vegetables,
[2:10:53.320 --> 2:10:56.840]  they all came up positive, it's all BS.
[2:10:56.840 --> 2:11:01.400]  Africa has the lowest COVID death rate because they won't take the shots.
[2:11:01.400 --> 2:11:07.400]  Meanwhile, in China, they are in full martial law, but they don't wear military uniforms.
[2:11:07.400 --> 2:11:12.960]  They wear the white bunny suits.
[2:11:12.960 --> 2:11:14.520]  Unbelievable garbage.
[2:11:14.520 --> 2:11:19.960]  Okay, taking calls who are the received, Kevin in Pennsylvania, welcome Kevin.
[2:11:19.960 --> 2:11:21.960]  Hello, can you hear me?
[2:11:21.960 --> 2:11:23.960]  I can brother, go ahead.
[2:11:23.960 --> 2:11:31.760]  Hey man, man, I love you man, you're everything man, I listen to you every day.
[2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:40.760]  First of all, I'd like to say, I listen to your show by a 605-475-5800 every day.
[2:11:40.760 --> 2:11:46.400]  I get on there and I listen when you come out, Verizon blocked my car from the cell
[2:11:46.400 --> 2:11:52.720]  phone, I'm hiking the Appalachian Trail and I'm at a quality end right at the moment.
[2:11:52.720 --> 2:11:56.240]  When you prayed earlier, that was awesome.
[2:11:56.240 --> 2:12:02.400]  And the globalists and these guys that are trying to kill us all, remember, they got
[2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:06.400]  the scorched earth, they got no one to answer to now.
[2:12:06.400 --> 2:12:09.920]  Once they take us out, they got no one to answer to.
[2:12:09.920 --> 2:12:12.120]  I don't put anything beyond them.
[2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:20.720]  My mother tried to wake me up a long time ago and it was you man and AI and Joe Biggs.
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:25.840]  They are January 6th, Ashley Barrett, Joe Biggs.
[2:12:25.840 --> 2:12:31.800]  They need to let these people out and you release them and I can't believe that this
[2:12:31.800 --> 2:12:33.720]  has went on like this.
[2:12:33.720 --> 2:12:37.920]  You're right, they're political prisoners and if we don't stand up, people like Joe
[2:12:37.920 --> 2:12:42.600]  Biggs, we are all going to be Joe Biggs, we're all going to be people like Stuart Rhodes
[2:12:42.600 --> 2:12:43.600]  who they totally set up.
[2:12:43.600 --> 2:12:47.160]  I don't believe anything they say because in filings against us, they just tell total
[2:12:47.160 --> 2:12:48.160]  lies.
[2:12:48.160 --> 2:12:51.960]  They say Owen attacked the Capitol, Owen doesn't work at Info Wars, he's indicted.
[2:12:51.960 --> 2:12:56.600]  I don't believe a damn thing they say, Kevin.
[2:12:56.600 --> 2:12:57.600]  Exactly.
[2:12:57.600 --> 2:13:05.800]  And I know two people, I'm from, I'm in Pennsylvania, the voter capital of the world, a voter fraud
[2:13:05.800 --> 2:13:13.960]  capital of the world, but I'm from West Tennessee and I know two people who got the shot exactly
[2:13:13.960 --> 2:13:18.200]  14 days later, they had heart attacks, they're still alive.
[2:13:18.200 --> 2:13:22.320]  I know another guy, he's a bodybuilder.
[2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:27.200]  He took the shot two weeks later, he dropped dead and I'm not ready.
[2:13:27.200 --> 2:13:35.280]  I can't release this now, but let's say there's the top five bodybuilders in history.
[2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:40.440]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Frank Zane, those names are up there.
[2:13:40.440 --> 2:13:47.000]  But it's a younger, no he's not young, but he's came after them, but he's the top guy.
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:49.520]  The top, I said his name, everybody would know it.
[2:13:49.520 --> 2:13:57.480]  He took, he's, he's, well I'm not going to say any more, he's a medical doctor.
[2:13:57.480 --> 2:14:02.440]  He took the second Pfizer shot and has blood clots for six months and his legs of atrophied
[2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:07.720]  and he might die.
[2:14:07.720 --> 2:14:08.960]  That's what we're talking about here.
[2:14:08.960 --> 2:14:11.240]  Thank you, brother, I appreciate your call.
[2:14:11.240 --> 2:14:18.720]  This is not a joke because I know this person.
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:25.240]  I was out in California with him a couple months ago and he was already sick from it,
[2:14:25.240 --> 2:14:31.080]  but you get it, he's tough guy, he can take it, you want to be able to go to all the events
[2:14:31.080 --> 2:14:36.360]  in the Arnold Classic and now he might have to get his legs cut off.
[2:14:36.360 --> 2:14:47.920]  Listen to game, we're going to go to break, Dylan and Lee and Brandon and Chad and Malto
[2:14:47.920 --> 2:14:51.920]  meal and we're going to continue to call so we can open the phones back up and we'll
[2:14:51.920 --> 2:14:57.360]  take more of your calls at 877-789-2539-877-789 Alex.
[2:14:57.360 --> 2:15:00.240]  The crew knows to put like 20 calls on the board and then just stop there.
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:03.600]  We're going to have time to get to more people, more of your calls, we'll take a few more
[2:15:03.600 --> 2:15:06.560]  after that as well.
[2:15:06.560 --> 2:15:13.920]  But yeah, I mean, they've had a 50,000% was the number I saw increase in heart attacks
[2:15:13.920 --> 2:15:18.520]  and microcarditis, heart swelling in football players and soccer players and basketball
[2:15:18.520 --> 2:15:20.720]  players and just everybody.
[2:15:20.720 --> 2:15:28.080]  It creates blood clots in the body and remember, Pfizer pulled out of a deal with India after
[2:15:28.080 --> 2:15:32.000]  India wanted to get vaccine independently medically checked.
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  Meanwhile, kindergartners are being given assignments as mainstream news to masturbate
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:38.080]  at home.
[2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:41.040]  This disgusting madness has to stop.
[2:15:41.040 --> 2:15:43.760]  Calvin Klein hires pregnant man for new campaign.
[2:15:43.760 --> 2:15:47.680]  Well, won't be buying any Calvin Klein.
[2:15:47.680 --> 2:15:51.960]  I mean, it's just full on assault on reality because they're selling his tyranny.
[2:15:51.960 --> 2:15:57.840]  Well, they're right back, stay with us.
[2:15:57.840 --> 2:15:59.200]  You see this?
[2:15:59.200 --> 2:16:04.400]  It's an info wars, republic defense card with original info wars art designed by yours truly
[2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:09.520]  with a little gold bar implanted in it and on the back, it's got a hologram.
[2:16:09.520 --> 2:16:14.240]  There are only 25,000 of these in existence and they'll never be made again.
[2:16:14.240 --> 2:16:18.080]  The bank that owns the men that has started putting these out the last few years just
[2:16:18.080 --> 2:16:24.160]  sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than we're selling this
[2:16:24.160 --> 2:16:25.160]  for.
[2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:29.080]  If you hear more, you can get these at 50% off and they fund the info war.

[2:18:56.240 --> 2:19:01.360]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand InfoWars.
[2:19:01.360 --> 2:19:05.600]  I've been on here a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little
[2:19:05.600 --> 2:19:06.600]  local radio show.
[2:19:06.600 --> 2:19:10.280]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge
[2:19:10.280 --> 2:19:11.280]  the globalist.
[2:19:11.280 --> 2:19:16.640]  And it was a t-shirt I designed the first one, MassMurderers Agreed Gun Control Works,
[2:19:16.640 --> 2:19:20.240]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew.
[2:19:20.240 --> 2:19:22.600]  That's our oldest design that we're still selling.
[2:19:22.600 --> 2:19:27.400]  We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions, because whatever
[2:19:27.400 --> 2:19:32.480]  stock we've got in, that's it, we're selling everything out to find the operation to get
[2:19:32.480 --> 2:19:33.480]  rid of inventory.
[2:19:33.480 --> 2:19:36.880]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future, they'll just be limited editions and short
[2:19:36.880 --> 2:19:41.240]  runs, so if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[2:19:41.240 --> 2:19:46.400]  Everyone almost forgot, we're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.

[2:19:59.120 --> 2:20:26.120]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:26.120 --> 2:20:30.800]  That's what Americans do now, they're always willing to trade away a little of their freedom
[2:20:30.800 --> 2:20:34.920]  in exchange for the feeling, the illusion of security.
[2:20:34.920 --> 2:20:41.240]  What we have now is a completely neurotic population obsessed with security and safety
[2:20:41.240 --> 2:20:46.120]  and crime and drugs and cleanliness and hygiene and germs.
[2:20:46.120 --> 2:20:48.240]  There's another thing, germs.
[2:20:48.240 --> 2:20:51.600]  Where did this sudden fear of germs come from in this country?
[2:20:51.600 --> 2:20:56.480]  Have you noticed this, the media constantly running stories about all the latest infections,
[2:20:56.480 --> 2:21:02.320]  salmonella, E. coli, hand to virus, bird flu, and Americans are, they panic easily, so now
[2:21:02.320 --> 2:21:06.200]  everybody's running around scrubbing this and spraying that and overcooking their food
[2:21:06.200 --> 2:21:10.680]  and repeatedly washing their hands, trying to avoid all contact with germs.
[2:21:10.680 --> 2:21:15.200]  It's ridiculous and it goes to ridiculous lengths, fear of germs.
[2:21:15.200 --> 2:21:17.600]  Why these f**king f**ksies?
[2:21:17.600 --> 2:21:23.040]  Hey, where's your sense of adventure, take a f**king chance, will you?
[2:21:23.040 --> 2:21:26.720]  Besides, what do you think you have an immune system for?
[2:21:26.720 --> 2:21:33.760]  It's for killing germs, but it needs practice, it needs germs to practice on you.
[2:21:33.760 --> 2:21:42.240]  So, so listen, so listen, if you kill all the germs around you and live a completely
[2:21:42.240 --> 2:21:46.560]  sterile life, then when germs do come along, you're not going to be prepared, and never
[2:21:46.560 --> 2:21:50.840]  mind ordinary germs, what are you going to do when some super virus comes along that
[2:21:50.840 --> 2:21:53.280]  turns your vital organs into liquid s**t?
[2:21:53.280 --> 2:21:57.160]  I'll tell you what you're going to do, you're going to get sick, you're going to die, and
[2:21:57.160 --> 2:22:00.600]  you're going to deserve it because you're f**king weak and you got a f**king weak immune
[2:22:00.600 --> 2:22:01.600]  system.
[2:22:01.600 --> 2:22:10.600]  Now, hey, don't tell me, hey, let me tell you a true story about immunization, okay?
[2:22:10.600 --> 2:22:16.520]  When I was a little boy in New York City in the 1940s, we swam in the Hudson River and
[2:22:16.520 --> 2:22:19.720]  it was filled with raw sewage, okay?
[2:22:19.720 --> 2:22:28.120]  We swam in raw sewage, you know, to cool off, and at that time the big fear was polio, thousands
[2:22:28.120 --> 2:22:32.120]  of kids died from polio every year, but you know something, in my neighborhood, no one
[2:22:32.120 --> 2:22:34.360]  ever got polio, no one ever.
[2:22:34.360 --> 2:22:35.360]  You know why?
[2:22:35.360 --> 2:22:42.080]  Because we swam in raw sewage, it strengthened our immune systems, the polio never had a
[2:22:42.080 --> 2:22:47.080]  prayer, we were tempered in raw s**t.
[2:22:47.080 --> 2:22:52.680]  The studies show that actual immunity is in that human afflux.
[2:22:52.680 --> 2:22:56.440]  All right, we're going to go back to your phone calls, I want to show you a picture
[2:22:56.440 --> 2:22:59.200]  of my daughter, this five now.
[2:22:59.200 --> 2:23:24.000]  Break it up, come here, this is what you're talking about, come on, come on, come on,
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:33.880]  come on, come on, come on, come on.
[2:23:33.880 --> 2:23:48.800]  Band, bag, bag, bag, bag, Dad, kid, bottle, bottle, bottle, bottle, bottle, bottle,osi,
[2:23:48.800 --> 2:24:03.140]  This is a photo of my daughter was two years old at the Duck Park feeding ducks and she's
[2:24:03.140 --> 2:24:10.480]  on my shoulders and it's just so archetypal that I'm in bliss and grounded looking at
[2:24:10.480 --> 2:24:17.280]  the ground and then she's on my shoulders the future looking up at infinity smiling
[2:24:17.280 --> 2:24:22.400]  for that future this image counters all their Satanism this is one that he didn't get to
[2:24:22.400 --> 2:24:32.320]  kill this is one that he didn't get we're right on track I ain't looking back
[2:24:32.320 --> 2:24:49.680]  that's why they don't we have children there's a strength you get from knowing you're taking
[2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:54.080]  care of somebody and completing that mission of your ancestors that had you and now you're
[2:24:54.080 --> 2:25:02.080]  deciding you're part of it and you're going forward I saw the light I've been baptized by
[2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:03.520]  the fire in your eyes
[2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:20.640]  satanists don't have a plane you have a plane I see our listeners all the time
[2:25:22.320 --> 2:25:27.840]  I shake your head whether you're black white old young I see that fire in your eye
[2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:40.640]  born to love again I'm a brand new man
[2:25:48.560 --> 2:25:54.880]  you'll never stop us let's jam another call right now let's talk to Dylan in Arizona you're on
[2:25:54.880 --> 2:26:01.760]  here welcome hey Alex can you hear me I love you brother go ahead how are you doing today
[2:26:01.760 --> 2:26:09.440]  I'm on fire brother good yeah I'm a longtime fan of the show uh I wanted to call in and and talk
[2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:14.400]  about the the crackpipes that the biden has been handing out which is public in the bill
[2:26:14.400 --> 2:26:21.600]  going on for six months but they say it doesn't exist you know I uh I kind of you know I wanted
[2:26:21.600 --> 2:26:28.640]  to present a different point of view here for you which is that you know I think I think some
[2:26:28.640 --> 2:26:34.720]  some of it is probably a little bit of a good thing now let me let me explain right you could
[2:26:34.720 --> 2:26:42.720]  go on about the war on the drugs and all that are happening but I do think you know maybe
[2:26:42.720 --> 2:26:47.280]  maybe given some of these people right because we can't you know we can't stop them from doing
[2:26:47.280 --> 2:26:55.040]  crack right but giving them some some resources to help keep themselves clean right or things that
[2:26:55.040 --> 2:27:00.320]  they can use to chew a no no I get needles so you don't get HIV you don't need new crackpipes it
[2:27:00.320 --> 2:27:07.440]  encourages it it normalizes it the CIA put out how to make it it's it's it's it I've thought this out
[2:27:07.440 --> 2:27:12.080]  I'm not disagreeing with you I'm just telling you brother that it's it's a fraud how do you put
[2:27:12.080 --> 2:27:17.920]  somebody in jail for 10 years for crack to give them crack pipes I now I agree with you they
[2:27:17.920 --> 2:27:22.800]  shouldn't be putting people in jail for it they should be helping but I think you know the people
[2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:27.840]  on the ground they can't really do those things right they just have to crack pipe it or they're
[2:27:27.840 --> 2:27:36.400]  you know the resources to help keep themselves safe at least you know nothing coming out of the
[2:27:36.400 --> 2:27:42.480]  Biden administration is to help people and but I understand what you're saying you think it's part
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:47.200]  of the decriminalization movement that's a trick why do you think Soros wants everybody to smoke
[2:27:47.200 --> 2:27:51.360]  marijuana I don't want to put you in jail for it but the modern marijuana a lot of the strains
[2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:57.120]  will brain damage you and give you schizophrenia that's on record so it's a complex issue the
[2:27:57.120 --> 2:28:01.040]  point is they're lying and saying they're not shipping out the crack pipes do you understand
[2:28:01.040 --> 2:28:08.800]  that my point oh yeah maybe oh see you're saying that they're they're oh you're saying that they're
[2:28:08.800 --> 2:28:14.480]  shipping out the crack pipes themselves the federal government paid to have crack pipe kits put
[2:28:14.480 --> 2:28:18.960]  together I showed all the documents they admit they did and now sake says they're not so it's
[2:28:18.960 --> 2:28:25.360]  the lying about it oh yeah I don't know why they don't just admit it because they're a lying pack
[2:28:25.360 --> 2:28:32.080]  of enemies God bless you because they don't like the truth because they live a lie their delusional

[2:32:11.120 --> 2:32:16.320]  organic in the volcanic soil better than watermelon coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers
[2:32:16.320 --> 2:32:19.680]  that you know the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever the
[2:32:19.680 --> 2:32:23.680]  point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government
[2:32:23.680 --> 2:32:27.600]  take over so i actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and i've been buying it for what 14 years
[2:32:27.600 --> 2:32:31.520]  and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50
[2:32:31.520 --> 2:32:35.440]  percent more per pound and i just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere

[2:35:43.440 --> 2:35:50.480]  mom and her siblings and she was kind of taken in by her grandfather and in an interview in 2017
[2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:56.800]  she discussed how in his house she became very close to him and there were pictures of carl marx
[2:35:56.800 --> 2:36:04.800]  and writings of carl marx on the wall her grandfather's name is mackayl chomiak mackayl chomiak
[2:36:04.800 --> 2:36:12.000]  mackayl chomiak three world war two and during world war two ran nazi propaganda newspapers
[2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:18.880]  in poland and the ukraine and i'm not i'm not braining your parade we you're you're right we've
[2:36:18.880 --> 2:36:23.840]  covered this this is all true he didn't just run him he was like the adjunct to joseph gerbils
[2:36:25.040 --> 2:36:32.720]  ah i did not know that so so after that she was educated at harbert became a journalist
[2:36:32.720 --> 2:36:39.040]  and uh while she was a journalist she traveled for about a year around the world with george soros
[2:36:41.680 --> 2:36:46.080]  yep that's who she is absolutely and that's who really runs your country it's unbelievable
[2:36:47.200 --> 2:36:56.880]  and a little a little i don't know the mainstream media in 1991 he was a high school drama teacher
[2:36:56.880 --> 2:37:03.280]  or sorry 1999 high school drama teacher in port coquitlam bc british colombia

[2:37:10.000 --> 2:37:18.480]  face breaking up who was who was justin fruto wow justin fruto was charged in 99 he had a trial

[2:37:24.560 --> 2:37:29.520]  and now the uh trial documents are sealed well that's who they want they want compromise people

[2:37:42.560 --> 2:37:46.480]  hey alex how's it going today man good talking to you brother good to be on the air in defiance
[2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:53.040]  of all their charity means they haven't won yet yeah and that's definitely the truth um i just
[2:37:53.040 --> 2:37:59.040]  wanted to call in because you know uh i want to talk a little bit about how we need to get
[2:37:59.040 --> 2:38:05.040]  out of this um we focus a lot about what's going on and trying to fight it and i think that's
[2:38:05.040 --> 2:38:09.600]  probably the right thing to do but i think we also need to be able to boil it down and recognize
[2:38:09.600 --> 2:38:16.480]  what's what's real and uh at this point it's these people are going for broke they're not
[2:38:16.480 --> 2:38:23.360]  going to stop whatever they whatever they want out of it whether it's you know depopulation or
[2:38:24.720 --> 2:38:29.040]  you know just control and power and being able to control us as slaves whatever it is we need
[2:38:29.040 --> 2:38:35.680]  to recognize that's the goal and they're going for it and we need to distance ourselves from that
[2:38:35.680 --> 2:38:40.560]  and just you know they want to play their games well why don't we just start playing our own
[2:38:40.560 --> 2:38:46.800]  and we gotta you know we're all stuck in this corporate world everybody's working a nine to five
[2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:55.040]  broke trying to uh just just get by and we need to start taking the extra time that we have after
[2:38:55.040 --> 2:39:00.480]  our jobs and start talking to each other and we need to start working on things side projects
[2:39:00.480 --> 2:39:05.040]  and get ourselves out of this i think that's our only option you're right we have to build the new
[2:39:05.040 --> 2:39:09.120]  world we're in the world but not of it we have to recognize that everything they're doing is
[2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:13.920]  assaulting us and only support grassroots and mom and bobs and independence and and and realize
[2:39:13.920 --> 2:39:18.480]  we're under attack we didn't ask for this fight but they started it and as i've said a thousand times
[2:39:19.120 --> 2:39:22.800]  i don't know how this is going to end but if they want to fight they better believe
[2:39:22.800 --> 2:39:29.440]  they've got one brother and and that is exactly where we are we have to recognize that not as victims
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:36.400]  but as overcomers and that's basically the whole slogan and everything info war stands for and that's
[2:39:36.400 --> 2:39:42.640]  who we are yeah yeah and uh and you do you really do a great job and i just wanted to say one more
[2:39:42.640 --> 2:39:48.640]  thing um you're you're one of the only people that i hear that really boiled down like how simple
[2:39:48.640 --> 2:39:53.600]  this actually is with these people they're not stupid people these people are not and they're
[2:39:53.600 --> 2:39:58.800]  not they're not dumb they're intelligent people and once everybody realizes these people aren't
[2:39:58.800 --> 2:40:06.080]  stupid the goal for their job is just different than it really it really makes them wonder and
[2:40:06.080 --> 2:40:11.360]  that's that's what we need to do we need to get people to think about that well that's right once
[2:40:11.360 --> 2:40:15.920]  you realize it's a predatory worldview where they've given up on god they've joined with evil
[2:40:15.920 --> 2:40:20.080]  then it all makes sense and their own writings admit that the debots group no more free will
[2:40:20.080 --> 2:40:24.800]  getting rid of your family getting rid of humans this is psychotic these people are the worst
[2:40:25.440 --> 2:40:32.480]  people on earth they're beyond creepy they are bad news brother i agree i agree well you're doing a
[2:40:32.480 --> 2:40:38.560]  great job and everybody here in michigan if we can we try to do what we can but just everybody
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:43.840]  work together and talk to each other that's right beautiful said thank you sir all right
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:48.640]  let's go ahead and take another call as we gotta break in three minutes two and a half minutes
[2:40:48.640 --> 2:40:56.160]  malto meal in wisconsin thanks for holding hi mr uh jones i'm a massive fan and i want to talk
[2:40:56.160 --> 2:41:03.280]  about some uh wild conspiracy theories and rabbit holes with uh milk and synth formula issue uh i was
[2:41:03.280 --> 2:41:11.520]  wondering if you remember the 2008 chinese melamine uh crisis melamine plastic in the baby formula
[2:41:11.520 --> 2:41:15.760]  yeah i need to sort of remember your memories bulletproof i love you so much for that yeah and
[2:41:15.760 --> 2:41:23.360]  since then there's been a huge distrust of uh domestic for chinese people formula and they
[2:41:23.360 --> 2:41:27.200]  import a lot of formula and if you look at the numbers i follow the numbers because you know i
[2:41:27.200 --> 2:41:32.800]  do like import export inventions here in wisconsin and we're a very state of multiverse and you know
[2:41:32.800 --> 2:41:41.280]  like they have the import number we're peaking to like 333 tons a thousand tons before coronavirus
[2:41:41.280 --> 2:41:48.480]  then started going down a bit and i think the infant formulas uh relate in the us is related to the
[2:41:48.480 --> 2:41:55.760]  Shanghai and chinese lockdown that may be like the n95 masks being exported during coronavirus
[2:41:55.760 --> 2:42:00.400]  we're having infant formula and stuff being shipped oh yeah it's getting shipped here and then
[2:42:00.400 --> 2:42:05.040]  relabeled as american or german you're absolutely right i think that's actually been in the news
[2:42:05.040 --> 2:42:08.960]  buried in some of the trade publications i saw a few days ago so you're totally on target obviously
[2:42:08.960 --> 2:42:14.080]  that's what you do for a living that's why you know where do you think this is going well i think
[2:42:14.080 --> 2:42:20.720]  it's like uh i've talked about before like uh the like easter island scenario where like you uh
[2:42:20.720 --> 2:42:26.800]  sabotage a country and pull all the resources slowly and then like everyone's trapped on the island
[2:42:26.800 --> 2:42:31.920]  you know and then it's like you know mad max scenario and then eventually it goes to like
[2:42:31.920 --> 2:42:38.560]  hunger games society where like the power elite then just comes back in and has like you know
[2:42:38.560 --> 2:42:43.600]  you know weirder rules and a different tyranny unauthoritarian takeover to stabilize the crisis
[2:42:43.600 --> 2:42:48.560]  they themselves began that is their exact words that is the great reset that is what claus robs

[2:44:09.680 --> 2:44:16.560]  newspapers that the family as we know it is a bad thing it must be ended and the first step in that
[2:44:16.560 --> 2:44:22.000]  is getting women out of the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:26.720]  sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing and i was just sitting here tonight making dinner

[2:49:27.920 --> 2:49:34.480]  warriors out there god bless you yeah i wanted to talk about um you know something everybody's
[2:49:34.480 --> 2:49:41.360]  been asking about a global solution that i think everybody can rally behind um you know and what
[2:49:41.360 --> 2:49:48.320]  made me started to think about this was i thought about what it is about you alex said i adore so
[2:49:48.320 --> 2:49:55.680]  much and it's your courage you've got courage like nobody else i've ever seen and i think
[2:49:56.400 --> 2:50:02.720]  we need to have more courage i need to have more courage and that brings me to the point that
[2:50:04.240 --> 2:50:11.120]  this idea needs to start at the tip of the spear and that's why i'm calling you i'm in the belly
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:19.360]  of the beast and what we need to do is we need to pick a day a day that we could call the people's
[2:50:19.360 --> 2:50:29.360]  day it will be a day that we could rally behind the 20 that are all awake and it will be the greatest
[2:50:29.360 --> 2:50:37.520]  day that the 20 are going to wake up the rest of the population and on that day we will email we
[2:50:37.520 --> 2:50:44.720]  will text we will call we will do whatever we can to get the word out you call it wake i mean i mean
[2:50:44.720 --> 2:50:51.520]  you call it a wake up day i mean because that that that yeah but what we need to do is because what's
[2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:56.880]  gonna happen is is the people who are asleep they're gonna get a message from not just you who
[2:50:57.600 --> 2:51:02.560]  you know everybody hears from not just me but five other people that they trust and they love
[2:51:02.560 --> 2:51:07.200]  and they're gonna go wow what is all this information that i totally agree with you but
[2:51:07.200 --> 2:51:12.560]  we need to have it every day we wake up day but you're right focus on the day pick a day to start
[2:51:12.560 --> 2:51:16.720]  and that's how the snowball starts rolling and believe me we've almost beat the globalists
[2:51:16.720 --> 2:51:22.720]  together with god's help it we're so close all their censorship all their brainwashing all their
[2:51:22.720 --> 2:51:28.560]  attacks all their surveillance would not be necessary if they were in power they are weak
[2:51:28.560 --> 2:51:35.840]  what they're doing is wrong that's right and if we did this on the day before school starts and
[2:51:35.840 --> 2:51:41.920]  that way when everybody goes to drop their kids off or you pick a day but i think you're right i
[2:51:41.920 --> 2:51:46.480]  think sunday is the day we're off and sundays when we reach out with people the ministry of truth
[2:51:47.200 --> 2:51:51.840]  to counter their ministry of truth and minister about why they're taking over
[2:51:51.840 --> 2:51:56.720]  and what they're doing so a ministry of warning people great idea let's codify that let's launch
[2:51:56.720 --> 2:52:03.760]  a chat thank you amazing julie in pennsylvania thank you for calling go ahead julie hello sir i
[2:52:03.760 --> 2:52:11.200]  just think you're great i was just going over the ownership chain of bristow mire's swib and
[2:52:11.200 --> 2:52:18.800]  abed labs who own infamel and similec that was delivered down at the border yes i think we need
[2:52:18.800 --> 2:52:25.600]  to find out how many pallets it was because if it was 200 pallets 300 pallets your previous
[2:52:25.600 --> 2:52:33.520]  color said that there was a decrease in in manufacturing of formula across the board globally
[2:52:33.520 --> 2:52:37.600]  yeah so there's a shortage how is the federal government owning so much of it means they've
[2:52:37.600 --> 2:52:43.200]  been hoarding it so sake accuses us of hoarding it the american people everything they do is the
[2:52:43.200 --> 2:52:50.400]  inverse yeah that's right and it was a premeditated act because this is not something that you ordered
[2:52:50.400 --> 2:52:57.280]  like next last week they had to have planning this for maybe a year two years even in order to be able
[2:52:57.280 --> 2:53:04.560]  to shave off the global supply so what i'm thinking about is who paid for this why how did
[2:53:04.560 --> 2:53:11.040]  these end up there and and who planned this because it had to have been the planning for this
[2:53:11.040 --> 2:53:18.000]  and perhaps even the payment for this took place before uh biden took control of the government
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:23.600]  wow julie what a smart call absolutely that's what we need good members of congress to be
[2:53:23.600 --> 2:53:27.520]  demanding answers from investigating and investigative journalists be looking at you're
[2:53:27.520 --> 2:53:35.600]  absolutely right the people who own burstomers with an ab ab at labs are all the same companies
[2:53:35.600 --> 2:53:44.480]  vanguard blackreek black rock it's ab at labs with the antigen test for the covid exactly and and
[2:53:44.480 --> 2:53:50.320]  there's no way that this could have taken place without the big boys being involved and and this
[2:53:50.320 --> 2:53:57.120]  was entirely premeditated and this was part of the grand plan and this had to have been planned
[2:53:57.120 --> 2:54:02.080]  over a year ago perfectly said thank you so much julie for the call we're moving quick to get
[2:54:02.080 --> 2:54:07.200]  everybody with amazing callers so proud of our audience how smart they are michael in california
[2:54:07.200 --> 2:54:13.120]  you're on the year go ahead hey alec yes sir so i've been thinking about your bandwidth cost
[2:54:13.120 --> 2:54:19.040]  you said you've been spending millions on those um and i and i remembered a uh a open source library
[2:54:19.040 --> 2:54:26.880]  i use for a project um called web torrent uh and basically what it does is peer-to-peer uh file
[2:54:26.880 --> 2:54:31.600]  sharing right and so that can go over the browser sure that's what i mean is that like bitshoot
[2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:38.720]  yeah it's like bitshoot yeah it uses web rtc um so basically the more people that are watching
[2:54:38.720 --> 2:54:42.800]  your videos no you're right and so if things like bitshoot don't work it was not a big audience
[2:54:42.800 --> 2:54:47.360]  but because we have a big audience we should move to that because we have the core audience to make
[2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:50.880]  it where it'll work that's a really good point we're in fact we've been talking about that
[2:54:51.920 --> 2:54:53.760]  yeah web torrent.io
[2:54:56.240 --> 2:54:59.120]  that's the website and explain to folks how that works
[2:55:00.240 --> 2:55:05.840]  yeah so right now you have one server with all your files on it and everyone who goes to your
[2:55:05.840 --> 2:55:11.920]  website is accessing that server to get the video file um and you have to pay for all that
[2:55:11.920 --> 2:55:18.480]  outgoing bandwidth right so what this essentially does is it inverts that relationship where every
[2:55:18.480 --> 2:55:24.000]  every node every peer every person who's accessing that data is accessing it from everyone else
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  while they're watching it well we got approached a few years ago about bitshoot wanting us to buy
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:34.080]  them and i just don't have the money i mean i don't i don't have two million dollars extra
[2:55:34.080 --> 2:55:39.840]  sitting around i maxed out but yeah we should probably try to start by every video have a
[2:55:39.840 --> 2:55:44.640]  version that is a torrent system we just didn't do it because the reliability issue but i think
[2:55:44.640 --> 2:55:48.080]  what the engineers are telling me what you're saying is because we already have such a big
[2:55:48.080 --> 2:55:52.800]  core audience that's what actually allows that infrastructure to build and that would be and
[2:55:52.800 --> 2:55:56.720]  that would make the videos more more accessible because for folks who don't know sometimes the
[2:55:56.720 --> 2:56:02.960]  videos don't work if you use that system yeah the more the more people accessing the
[2:56:02.960 --> 2:56:11.920]  website and the videos the faster and more resilient it becomes well we need we we need
[2:56:11.920 --> 2:56:17.440]  to create a bit i mean i mean we may have to because i mean we're just maxed out that is a
[2:56:17.440 --> 2:56:24.480]  really good at anything else sir that'll do it thank you brother all right i'm gonna go to

[3:01:36.880 --> 3:01:45.760]  forgetfulness blood clots parkinson's disease i mean it's just ridiculous and i try to warn
[3:01:45.760 --> 3:01:52.400]  people but yet they're still getting out and going to get these jabs i just don't understand i just
[3:01:52.400 --> 3:01:57.680]  don't get it well national polls show the majority of americans are now against the shots but yeah
[3:01:57.680 --> 3:02:01.840]  they're really targeting old folks and then we have statistics we know it's killing them

[3:02:14.800 --> 3:02:20.800]  mark to tell people that wow another firsthand account ron in arizona ron you're our tailgater
[3:02:20.800 --> 3:02:28.720]  before peace until he takes over go ahead ron well thank you um appreciate the opportunity
[3:02:29.440 --> 3:02:33.760]  you know every day i look at my computer i get up in the middle of the night i look at what's
[3:02:33.760 --> 3:02:40.640]  going on and i wonder you know how did we get here and i remember when joe biden was running for
[3:02:40.640 --> 3:02:47.120]  president and when he would say i'm going to beat donald trump he'd get a standing ovation
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:53.760]  and when he says you know trump trump that's when people would cheer you know he never laid out any
[3:02:54.400 --> 3:03:02.160]  plans he never laid out any um you know great uh ideas so you know what we have is what we
[3:03:02.160 --> 3:03:08.960]  selected as a country you know and is it going to take three years for this to go away alex
[3:03:08.960 --> 3:03:15.920]  you know we let joe biden steal the election i think evidence overwhelming that happened
[3:03:16.640 --> 3:03:20.320]  but but there's the argument of well he makes it so bad to the left leave him in
[3:03:20.320 --> 3:03:23.920]  he'll wreck the country before then they know that what do you think of the plan to try to
[3:03:23.920 --> 3:03:28.560]  impeach him or have the impeachment as a way to expose cutting off the energy opening the borders
[3:03:28.560 --> 3:03:34.560]  i mean do you agree with me on that well it's definitely a process that's available whether
[3:03:34.560 --> 3:03:40.320]  or not they'll act on it it's anybody's guess well you sound like a smart guy where do you think this
[3:03:40.320 --> 3:03:45.120]  is all gonna end you think the deep state can even let us have elections 179 days or what happens
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:51.680]  in the general election in two and a half years well hopefully we're gonna make it that far as a
[3:03:51.680 --> 3:03:57.280]  nation and we're gonna have this opportunity to correct the direction that the country's going
[3:03:57.280 --> 3:04:04.960]  right no i agree with you but do you think we'll even get to that point it's 50 50 in my eyes
[3:04:06.320 --> 3:04:11.200]  in my heart i agree in closing how do you think the deep state will try to stay in power
[3:04:14.960 --> 3:04:18.800]  just probably through the same mechanisms that they've utilized in the past i don't believe
[3:04:18.800 --> 3:04:23.760]  they're uh you're gonna change anything at this point of the uh you know the game i agree false
[3:04:23.760 --> 3:04:28.000]  flags war collapse i agree so the only we can do is educate the public and help they don't go along
[3:04:28.000 --> 3:04:33.120]  with it right yes but in closing i want to say one thing alex i've been listening to you for a while

[3:06:37.600 --> 3:06:42.880]  of you that don't know now i'm going to be covering a bombshell uh news story something related to
[3:06:42.880 --> 3:06:47.920]  uh a topic that we've been hearing about especially in independent media circles
[3:06:48.480 --> 3:06:56.000]  2000 mules being released but in october of 2020 i published a report as a matter of fact i think
[3:06:56.640 --> 3:07:02.640]  alex jones is going to be he's going to be pleasantly surprised to know that i had a very
[3:07:02.640 --> 3:07:08.240]  very high level trusted source and if i mentioned that person's name he'd be he'd be very pleased
[3:07:08.240 --> 3:07:12.800]  to tip me off to the fact that the doj was investigating a lot of the stuff that we're
[3:07:12.800 --> 3:07:20.160]  seeing uh in 2000 mules now i published report in october of 2020 that the doj was actually
[3:07:20.160 --> 3:07:25.120]  investigating these people that report is going to come to you know before we get to that um
[3:07:25.920 --> 3:07:32.960]  breaking news here it's it hasn't even hit uh the i think it's just barely now hitting the
[3:07:32.960 --> 3:07:39.840]  mainstream media uh for those of you that know about a pastor's um efforts to keep his doors
[3:07:39.840 --> 3:07:47.360]  open during covid early on they were shutting uh church doors down a pastor tony spell in louisiana
[3:07:48.320 --> 3:07:54.560]  just got word actually just as i was coming on the air this is so spectacular uh the best way to
[3:07:54.560 --> 3:08:00.000]  title uh this particular news announcement this breaking news announcement is god wins
[3:08:00.000 --> 3:08:08.720]  uh pastor tony spell in louisiana a pastor who stood up not just once twice the covid
[3:08:08.720 --> 3:08:13.280]  tyrants were attempt they've sent the police they were at one point the governor was kind of
[3:08:13.280 --> 3:08:18.320]  send the national guard because he refused to close his doors and thousands of people were
[3:08:18.320 --> 3:08:28.080]  coming to his church he faced um 35 in 35 cases a relatively long period of time in jail but he
[3:08:28.080 --> 3:08:34.160]  kept appealing uh he kept appealing and took it all the way to the supreme court of louisiana
[3:08:34.160 --> 3:08:40.480]  and i'm i'm so honored to bring you this news here exclusively on info wars dot com louisiana
[3:08:40.480 --> 3:08:46.240]  supreme court justice crane states as follows in this criminal proceeding we find certain
[3:08:46.240 --> 3:08:53.120]  provisions of two executive orders as applied to the defendant pastor tony spell violate his
[3:08:53.120 --> 3:08:59.440]  fundamental right to exercise religion and do not survive strict scrutiny and are thus
[3:09:00.160 --> 3:09:09.920]  unconstitutional ladies and gentlemen this is a landmark and i mean that the the shock waves
[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:15.120]  haven't even hit yet the reverberations of this supreme court ruling as it relates to the u.s
[3:09:15.120 --> 3:09:21.600]  constitution and pastor tony spell who was if this ruling had not come was facing a long long
[3:09:21.600 --> 3:09:28.880]  time in jail uh 35 uh charges against him that had all been appealed uh the full force of the
[3:09:28.880 --> 3:09:36.640]  government brought upon him and thank thank the lord everybody thank the lord for bringing
[3:09:36.640 --> 3:09:44.240]  this ruling uh the u.s constitution stands and in the end god wins and absolutely epic epic
[3:09:44.240 --> 3:09:50.080]  ruling i hope that uh pastor spell will be making the rounds he's very articulate man
[3:09:50.080 --> 3:09:55.920]  one of the most constitutional pastors i've ever uh come into contact with on the p santilly show
[3:09:55.920 --> 3:10:01.280]  in just in case you don't know um what the p santilly show is we broadcast at eight a.m it's
[3:10:01.280 --> 3:10:06.960]  actually five hours a day today it just so happens to be six uh hours by broadcasting on
[3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:12.880]  the alex jones show we're so honored to be doing that but we broadcast five hours live a day
[3:10:12.880 --> 3:10:19.920]  eight a.m eastern six p.m eastern uh and of course uh in between time tuning into the alex jones show
[3:10:19.920 --> 3:10:27.520]  and i have done so uh for the better part of uh i don't know 20 something years 25 26 years um now
[3:10:28.400 --> 3:10:36.560]  good segue to my next topic because i've always had a certain perception uh let's say x-ray vision
[3:10:36.560 --> 3:10:43.840]  goggles uh when i see how the deep state operates uh as i've been in tune with how to do deep
[3:10:43.840 --> 3:10:51.920]  research and also uh build a relationship with some pretty high level sources that have trusted
[3:10:51.920 --> 3:10:58.080]  my integrity to at least keep their names anonymous and their name shall of course remain anonymous
[3:10:58.080 --> 3:11:04.320]  in this instance but i want to tell you i published i published a report here and let's um
[3:11:04.320 --> 3:11:14.400]  um uh let's just go right to this um in october of 2020 october 2020 at peter santilly.com i publish
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:23.520]  report that says why has in christopher rey's fbi arrested three masterminds allegedly behind the
[3:11:23.520 --> 3:11:30.640]  illegal nationwide ballot ballot harvesting scheme and these three individuals it may or
[3:11:30.640 --> 3:11:37.600]  may not recognize them one to the left his name is norm eisen uh i think that if i play i have one
[3:11:37.600 --> 3:11:43.440]  clip that i'm going to play here and you'll know who he is instantly the man in the middle um his
[3:11:43.440 --> 3:11:49.520]  name is mark alias and he probably been hearing a lot about him uh recently especially as it relates
[3:11:49.520 --> 3:11:55.920]  to election um election laws that uh he was the mastermind behind it on the left side of the political
[3:11:55.920 --> 3:12:03.920]  spectrum uh to set up all of the uh the laws that allowed them to stuff ballot boxes send out
[3:12:03.920 --> 3:12:10.400]  millions and millions of ballots uh all throughout the country uh getting bypassing the legislature
[3:12:10.400 --> 3:12:16.480]  of course and going to the election boards and getting them to sign decrees uh due to covet
[3:12:16.480 --> 3:12:21.840]  using the excuse of covet that mark alias and the third individual his name is and why these
[3:12:21.840 --> 3:12:29.760]  three individuals are important his name is neil kaital or kaito whatever his name is less prominent
[3:12:29.760 --> 3:12:38.800]  name in our circle but those three names i came to the forefront in october of 2020 when a extremely
[3:12:38.800 --> 3:12:46.160]  trusted high-level source said that the department of justice was investigating and this was at a
[3:12:46.160 --> 3:12:53.360]  time when we didn't know about 2000 mules it it literally struck me when uh when i was reviewing
[3:12:54.160 --> 3:13:02.160]  alex jones's review of 2000 mules and i had remembered uh without ever having spoken to alex
[3:13:02.160 --> 3:13:08.320]  he has a lot of great sources over the the past decades some of the best sources within our
[3:13:08.320 --> 3:13:13.920]  government the white hats that are concerned about our country and they want to get information
[3:13:13.920 --> 3:13:20.400]  out there so i did not speak to uh to alex jones or anybody that shall ever uh be named here but
[3:13:20.400 --> 3:13:25.760]  this is what i was told is that these individuals were caught now i'm going to put on the screen
[3:13:25.760 --> 3:13:30.400]  just very briefly here we're not going to dig into the exact specifics but this investigation was
[3:13:30.400 --> 3:13:36.560]  conducted by the department of justice they caught these individuals these three individuals
[3:13:36.560 --> 3:13:44.560]  communicating in a very sophisticated manner and here's a copy of a screenshot of their communications
[3:13:45.360 --> 3:13:56.160]  where on gaming chat rooms they were literally organizing an effort to valid harvest now this
[3:13:56.160 --> 3:14:02.560]  epiphany came to me as i said when alex jones was doing a review of 2000 mules and i thought about
[3:14:02.560 --> 3:14:07.280]  how these gentlemen who were communicating and also the impact that it had when i was sitting in
[3:14:07.280 --> 3:14:13.280]  the movie theater uh here in sincenity watching 2000 mules i said this is one of the most
[3:14:13.280 --> 3:14:21.680]  sophisticated operations this is a military-styled attack upon our republic the amount of organization
[3:14:21.680 --> 3:14:26.960]  communication in a short period of time to get that number of ballots in five to ten ballot
[3:14:26.960 --> 3:14:33.600]  increments stuffed into these uh these uh these ballot drop boxes requires a tremendous amount
[3:14:33.600 --> 3:14:40.080]  of organization a lot of leadership and i say leadership as far as organization is concerned
[3:14:40.080 --> 3:14:44.560]  to get people on moving in the right direction in a short period of time and of course keep it
[3:14:44.560 --> 3:14:50.720]  keep a lid on it uh you can't go on twitter and say hey we need 50 more ballots in this jurisdiction
[3:14:51.840 --> 3:14:55.520]  not a lot of communications going back and forth to these nonprofits
[3:14:55.520 --> 3:15:01.760]  because as you know in discovery when they take a look at the court records is there any communication
[3:15:01.760 --> 3:15:09.040]  that you have email or text or otherwise um well what they were in fact doing was talking
[3:15:09.040 --> 3:15:14.560]  in these gaming chat rooms this is a method that these covert operators have done all throughout
[3:15:14.560 --> 3:15:20.320]  the world i'm going to prove it to you we're going to do it right here exclusively on alex

[3:20:10.800 --> 3:20:16.640]  welcome back everybody you're tuned in live to this fourth hour of alex jones's show the
[3:20:16.640 --> 3:20:24.400]  uh show broadcast at uh band dot video uh info wars dot com of course pages and websites that
[3:20:24.400 --> 3:20:31.040]  i've frequented uh for many many years uh you know today i was excited i actually came up
[3:20:31.040 --> 3:20:37.040]  with a couple of ideas because i've always been very very supportive as i always say uh supporting
[3:20:37.040 --> 3:20:43.840]  independent media is so critical right now and this this info war we and we are without a doubt
[3:20:43.840 --> 3:20:50.480]  uh at war with this deep state with these uh with this cabal and uh the way to defeat them
[3:20:50.480 --> 3:20:55.840]  is to deliver the truth to the american people and i've been saying recently and it's so true
[3:20:55.840 --> 3:21:03.200]  that without your support truth dies it comes to a screeching halt um i i noticed that uh
[3:21:03.840 --> 3:21:13.120]  that alex had published a um a page on info wars store dot com alex jones was right and i had an
[3:21:13.120 --> 3:21:19.440]  idea myself i'm gonna actually pick up and i've always been supportive i i get up a brain force
[3:21:19.440 --> 3:21:25.360]  uh plentiful supply of course keeps me going uh but alex jones was right i'm gonna pick up two
[3:21:25.360 --> 3:21:32.640]  of those teach t-shirts to help support uh info wars one i'm actually gonna put in a frame because
[3:21:32.640 --> 3:21:38.720]  it's so symbolic of everything that i've learned over the past couple of decades that in the beginning
[3:21:38.720 --> 3:21:44.880]  i thought was all conspiracy theory but as i did research of course i discovered that dating all
[3:21:44.880 --> 3:21:50.960]  the way back to you know 10 15 years ago that alex jones was in fact right i remember he was the
[3:21:50.960 --> 3:21:59.040]  one of the first ones to introduce me uh to western land issues that take over agenda 21 in fact uh
[3:21:59.040 --> 3:22:06.080]  there uh where agenda 21 is now agenda 2030 but alex out out there in western lands doing
[3:22:06.080 --> 3:22:12.960]  investigations doing excellent documentary so i'm gonna not only support uh alex jones and info
[3:22:12.960 --> 3:22:18.800]  wars dot com and the crew over there i'm gonna double up and get two of those t-shirts put one
[3:22:18.800 --> 3:22:25.280]  in a frame because of the sheer symbolism alex jones was right and we've certainly all benefited
[3:22:25.280 --> 3:22:29.120]  from that all right now let's get back to i'm going to tell you this story i'm going to break it down
[3:22:29.120 --> 3:22:35.360]  for you and tell you how it came then i'm going to tell you how significant this information is so
[3:22:35.360 --> 3:22:43.040]  back in october of 2020 came to me that the department of justice was investigating because
[3:22:43.040 --> 3:22:50.000]  they were very very concerned about the ballot harvesting as you recall project veritas had
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:56.880]  actually done an expose um where they actually found people getting paid to move ballots um
[3:22:57.840 --> 3:23:02.880]  you can barely remember that especially with the information flow that comes to us uh since the
[3:23:02.880 --> 3:23:08.720]  you know just prior to the 2020 election and onward but uh project veritas actually published that
[3:23:08.720 --> 3:23:15.600]  scathing expose documenting illegal ballot harvesting in ilhan omar's district um right
[3:23:15.600 --> 3:23:23.600]  about that time marco lias neil uh katyal or whatever his name is and norm eisen were identified
[3:23:23.600 --> 3:23:31.520]  as individuals who allegedly masterminded uh one of the largest voter fraud scams in american history
[3:23:31.520 --> 3:23:38.800]  so despite of course overwhelming evidence and eyewitness accounts fbi director christopher ray
[3:23:39.760 --> 3:23:46.880]  denied the existence of national voter fraud at all but the department of justice was in fact
[3:23:46.880 --> 3:23:54.560]  investigating the communications that were taking place uh in their their gaming channel threads
[3:23:54.560 --> 3:23:59.520]  they were actually following it and why it came to me is because the information was not being
[3:23:59.520 --> 3:24:07.200]  advanced at the federal bureau of investigation and in fact was being washed but white hats at the
[3:24:07.200 --> 3:24:13.040]  department of justice were continuing their investigation and had overwhelming evidence
[3:24:13.040 --> 3:24:20.640]  back then in october of 2020 um to corroborate what project veritas was putting out in that
[3:24:20.640 --> 3:24:28.240]  illegal ballot harvesting um expose by project veritas now i realize just how significant
[3:24:28.240 --> 3:24:34.480]  it is especially when you consider and watch the 2000 mules documentary uh that was published of
[3:24:34.480 --> 3:24:42.800]  course with um kathryn engelbrecht from truethevote.org and dinesh desuza masterful masterful job that
[3:24:42.800 --> 3:24:48.640]  they did collecting all of this data and at the time it was certainly a gamble for them to collect
[3:24:48.640 --> 3:24:54.320]  all of that data piece everything together but you know what we're now connecting a lot of dots
[3:24:54.320 --> 3:25:01.120]  and and and one of those dots and they're very significant dots of course is who are these people
[3:25:01.120 --> 3:25:07.600]  behind the scenes that were organizing this effort i just grabbed it after 2000 mules in fact in
[3:25:07.600 --> 3:25:15.120]  syncynatty um i was sitting there in the theater uh knowing full well when i went in exactly what
[3:25:15.120 --> 3:25:20.960]  i was going to be seeing i knew uh because i had published a report that there was uh extensive
[3:25:20.960 --> 3:25:27.360]  uh ballot harvesting that the doj was investigating that investigation was being covered up and i said
[3:25:27.360 --> 3:25:34.720]  you know let's see some forensic evidence through this documentary and halfway through uh i said okay
[3:25:34.720 --> 3:25:40.720]  this is this is pretty overwhelming the extent at which they connected all these dots and gone by
[3:25:40.720 --> 3:25:48.080]  cell phone pangs uh and finding high definition video of these individuals doing this and it just
[3:25:48.080 --> 3:25:54.400]  struck me um i was almost overwhelmed and this again i'm going to repeat this i knew what i was
[3:25:54.400 --> 3:25:59.600]  going to be seeing when i went i went to support the documentary and be with a group of like-minded
[3:25:59.600 --> 3:26:05.760]  individuals but we the people we godly patriots that were pleased that we were going to have a
[3:26:05.760 --> 3:26:10.320]  tool to share with our friends and family members especially on the left side of the political
[3:26:10.320 --> 3:26:17.600]  spectrum um share this tool with our friends and family member i was starting to become overwhelmed
[3:26:17.600 --> 3:26:22.160]  by this sophistication because i thought to myself these are not big trays of ballots that
[3:26:22.160 --> 3:26:30.080]  were being dumped to that dumped into the boxes these were like three five ten and in the thousands
[3:26:31.200 --> 3:26:36.720]  distributed in of course the primary jurisdictions but as you can imagine uh i'm sure it was all
[3:26:36.720 --> 3:26:42.000]  throughout the country in certain regards and then i sat there and i reflected and i thought about
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:50.320]  the number of decades and then for the 2020 election i thought to myself this is a most
[3:26:50.320 --> 3:26:58.240]  military-style uh organization how are they able to do it by the end of the video i was so upset
[3:26:58.240 --> 3:27:04.480]  at what it take in place but even then i had not connected the dots i regardless of the
[3:27:04.480 --> 3:27:11.840]  investigations that i've done exposing uh election fraud including electronic voting machine fraud
[3:27:11.840 --> 3:27:19.200]  is also one element of it was was that the uh the the core of their system i'm going to tell you
[3:27:19.200 --> 3:27:24.240]  in the next segment we're going to cover this because i i have dug into this i've looked at the
[3:27:24.240 --> 3:27:30.560]  forensic uh analysis that was done in colorado i've looked at all the jurisdiction jurisdictions
[3:27:30.560 --> 3:27:37.360]  from uh georgia uh to michigan and i've been connecting these dots and the software that's
[3:27:37.360 --> 3:27:43.520]  contained within these machines and how these machines are basically used to calculate let's say
[3:27:43.520 --> 3:27:50.800]  for every one vote that comes in for president trump they calculate to calculation one point
[3:27:50.800 --> 3:28:00.880]  three votes for uh let's go brandon and that establishes how many ballots they need to grab
[3:28:00.880 --> 3:28:08.800]  from the warehouse to put in the box the counts are matching up um are you able to detect this
[3:28:08.800 --> 3:28:13.600]  electronic voting machine fraud well they have malicious software in there that deletes all
[3:28:13.600 --> 3:28:19.440]  the forensic evidence but make no mistake about it the source coding uh that's in these machines
[3:28:19.440 --> 3:28:26.240]  have always kept it proprietary these machines are used i believe and i and it's a pretty well
[3:28:26.240 --> 3:28:32.000]  informed opinion that these machines are used to calculate how many of these ballots that they put
[3:28:32.000 --> 3:28:38.240]  in these boxes pull them out of the warehouse so they can stay under the radar we'll dig in even
[3:28:38.240 --> 3:28:44.000]  further i'm going to discuss norm eisen on the other side of this break don't go away you you

[3:33:15.360 --> 3:33:21.840]  the louisiana supreme court ruling uh in favor of pastor spell great american patriot i'm telling you
[3:33:21.840 --> 3:33:27.840]  he is a great american patriot he's been on on info wars i think on multiple shows uh since
[3:33:27.840 --> 3:33:34.800]  covet tyranny uh descended upon the united states of america uh but uh thank god and i say
[3:33:34.800 --> 3:33:41.280]  you know god wins in this supreme court ruling because he stood up to keep his doors open as an
[3:33:41.280 --> 3:33:49.600]  essential business he refused to close his doors uh he was um of course resistant to covet tyranny
[3:33:49.600 --> 3:33:54.720]  but he was a non-combatant they wanted to use military force against him so a landmark ruling
[3:33:54.720 --> 3:34:02.400]  coming today on this and you think friday the 13th is some sort of uh pocus pocus uh conspiracy
[3:34:02.400 --> 3:34:07.440]  theory but it's certainly a day that we will celebrate for a long time to come land landmark
[3:34:07.440 --> 3:34:13.760]  ruling this report right now that i'm doing exclusively on info wars dot com although i've
[3:34:13.760 --> 3:34:21.360]  broadcast back in october of 2020 that the doj was investigating that and i didn't know who
[3:34:21.920 --> 3:34:29.200]  uh norm eisen was until i connected the dots in the following fashion i'm going to play this video
[3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:34.400]  and it'll make a little bit more sense to you but it's going to lay the um uh the cobblestones here
[3:34:34.400 --> 3:34:40.080]  on the on the path to discovering who he is i'm going to play this and everyone will recognize him
[3:34:40.080 --> 3:34:46.560]  this house judiciary committee uh professor carlin do scholars of impeachment generally
[3:34:46.560 --> 3:34:54.800]  agree that abuse of power is an impeachable offense yes they do professor garhart do you agree
[3:34:54.800 --> 3:35:02.480]  that abuse of power is impeachable yes sir i'd like to focus the panel on the evidence they considered
[3:35:02.480 --> 3:35:09.920]  and the findings in the intelligence committee report that the president solicited the interference
[3:35:09.920 --> 3:35:18.560]  of a foreign government ukraine in the 2020 us presidential election now remember norm eisen
[3:35:18.560 --> 3:35:23.840]  there was uh some wranglings during the ukraine impeachment the multiple impeachments russia russia
[3:35:23.840 --> 3:35:30.640]  russia but when ukraine came they changed the rules as they always do all these people do the
[3:35:30.640 --> 3:35:35.600]  lawfare organization i mean this is one of the most powerful forces on the planet this is how
[3:35:35.600 --> 3:35:42.000]  they use the full force of the government ultimately they go to guns eventually as as we already know
[3:35:42.000 --> 3:35:48.240]  you know mal took the guns and i'm sure that the people that are behind this lawfare a group
[3:35:48.240 --> 3:35:55.280]  you're going to hear about norm eisen is not an elected official he's literally they declared
[3:35:55.280 --> 3:36:01.680]  him to be a staff member for the purposes of doing this impeachment hearing a staff member i
[3:36:01.680 --> 3:36:10.640]  remember when they should they changed the rules uh jerry nadla of course nancy nancy palasi uh and
[3:36:11.520 --> 3:36:16.720]  her she opened up her bottle of crown royal of course and and deemed norm eisen to be a staff
[3:36:16.720 --> 3:36:23.120]  member that would be highly qualified but in a very scripted this guy is so dangerous and you're
[3:36:23.120 --> 3:36:31.760]  going to find out exactly how dangerous uh he is um norm eisen is literally the guy who wrote
[3:36:31.760 --> 3:36:37.840]  two documents here and i have them and i want to show to you uh two documents very very dangerous
[3:36:37.840 --> 3:36:44.480]  documents one was this one right here and i'm going to read the title of it he ran and documented
[3:36:44.480 --> 3:36:50.960]  preventing a disrupted presidential election election and transition does everyone remember
[3:36:50.960 --> 3:36:57.040]  that we you know hey listen we're we're all likeminded we were on the internet we're reading
[3:36:57.040 --> 3:37:04.560]  these documents i i downloaded it i saved it and published it uh in this article uh i know who
[3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:10.400]  drafted it it was norm eisen but the name didn't really mean too much to me until i published this
[3:37:10.400 --> 3:37:16.320]  report so i embedded it but the election the transition integrity project is something that
[3:37:16.320 --> 3:37:24.320]  norm eisen was running um this document essentially scripted exactly how the 2020
[3:37:24.320 --> 3:37:31.280]  election was going to go how did he know because he was involved with the log lawfare group behind
[3:37:31.280 --> 3:37:41.280]  the scenes with his cronies um neil kytel uh as and by the way they're consuming if they want to i have
[3:37:41.280 --> 3:37:49.280]  sourced i have documentation i have audio recordings i have whistleblowers that will come forward
[3:37:49.280 --> 3:37:56.240]  white hats at the doj that know about this and still do uh to this day that these guys were
[3:37:56.240 --> 3:38:03.680]  being investigating for running a very sophisticated let's say uh network to communicate with 2000
[3:38:03.680 --> 3:38:09.120]  mules or at the very least i don't know about those actual mules all the way down to the mules
[3:38:09.120 --> 3:38:13.920]  but i do know that they were communicating covertly in the gaming chat rooms now they
[3:38:13.920 --> 3:38:19.600]  were also involved in the transition integrity project and guess what else norm eisen was
[3:38:19.600 --> 3:38:25.600]  involved in not just involved this guy is so dangerous it's going to blow your mind and
[3:38:25.600 --> 3:38:35.600]  i'm going to remind everybody alex jones's sources are unbelievable uh if he heard the
[3:38:35.600 --> 3:38:40.320]  heard the name of my source which he likely won't be just because i'm i'm an investigative
[3:38:40.320 --> 3:38:46.960]  journalist with integrity and will never reveal my sources of course the heist maybe one day uh if
[3:38:46.960 --> 3:38:52.800]  we can count on secure communications i'll tell him who it was and he will smile and he'll know
[3:38:52.800 --> 3:38:58.960]  the validity uh of of this uh information that came to me norm eisen ladies and gentlemen
[3:38:58.960 --> 3:39:08.800]  is a cia lock he wrote the playbook uh it's called the democracy playbook preventing and
[3:39:08.800 --> 3:39:16.880]  reversing democratic backsliding essentially uh he wrote the playbook on color revolutions okay
[3:39:17.520 --> 3:39:24.560]  color revolutions norm eisen um it gets it gets worse than this okay i'm telling you right now
[3:39:24.560 --> 3:39:31.360]  uh it gets so bad uh when you discover who not norm eisen is in this seat as a staffer
[3:39:33.600 --> 3:39:39.920]  allowed to be there by joey naidla okay and uh antsy palose
[3:39:42.080 --> 3:39:48.160]  allowed to be there as a staffer scripting the questions and allowing his his cia is
[3:39:48.160 --> 3:39:55.520]  a cia counterparts testify before the the house uh committee totally scripted as everything has
[3:39:55.520 --> 3:39:59.840]  been the russia russia russia collusion thing it always falls apart but it's always scripted
[3:40:00.400 --> 3:40:05.360]  um but norm eisen wrote the book on color revolutions he worked for the cia
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:14.400]  there's another person who he admires and you're gonna hear on the other side of this next
[3:40:14.400 --> 3:40:20.960]  upcoming break uh who his hero is who his mentor is i'm gonna give you the name i want you to
[3:40:20.960 --> 3:40:25.760]  write it down commit it to memory and go look them up it's a name that i was shocked when i
[3:40:25.760 --> 3:40:36.160]  discovered uh the name his name is gene sharp gene sharp if you're if you're a uh an info
[3:40:36.160 --> 3:40:42.800]  wing not like main you go down the rabbit hole to learn who gene sharp is norm eisen is essentially
[3:40:42.800 --> 3:40:49.840]  the new gene sharp that applied the technological methods for instance communicating and gaming
[3:40:49.840 --> 3:40:55.280]  chat rooms as to how you communicate with each other uh per the playbook but using technology
[3:40:55.280 --> 3:41:03.280]  gene sharp uh what he was taking down uh countries uh ambodia vietnam i mean just the whole list of
[3:41:03.280 --> 3:41:08.800]  countries the gene sharp is taken down through uh color revolutionary methods essentially has
[3:41:08.800 --> 3:41:15.040]  disintegrated pulverized communist dictatorships around the world that was done by gene sharp
[3:41:15.040 --> 3:41:21.120]  and his book that they that he published made it to the revolutionaries in iran they would go by
[3:41:21.120 --> 3:41:26.720]  the script they would topple uh governments and it doesn't matter chow chesky and romania uh for
[3:41:26.720 --> 3:41:33.280]  instance he had all the guns uh he had the bureaucracies but the bureaucracies fail when the people
[3:41:33.280 --> 3:41:42.560]  are non-compliant um so they use peaceful nonviolent colored styled revolutionary tactics to subvert
[3:41:42.560 --> 3:41:49.280]  these communist dictatorships what did norm eisen do he took all of his experience in taking down
[3:41:49.280 --> 3:41:56.000]  these regimes around the world over the years came to the united states and activated of course all
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:42:01.200]  of his uh state department i believe the state department is a is a cia storefront all the
[3:42:01.200 --> 3:42:06.960]  individuals that you saw uh testifying uh these are these are cia people they were involved in the
[3:42:06.960 --> 3:42:14.400]  overthrow of the ukraine norm eisen himself was involved in the overthrow of the ukraine
[3:42:15.120 --> 3:42:19.520]  not just writing this playbook but he was involved in doing this all throughout the world
[3:42:19.520 --> 3:42:25.760]  and of course these white hats cia people think that they're doing good for the sake of america
[3:42:25.760 --> 3:42:31.760]  to bring down communism and install install freedom and democracy uh they think that they're doing
[3:42:31.760 --> 3:42:37.280]  the right thing uh but a lot of them know that they're employing those tactics here in the united
[3:42:37.280 --> 3:42:45.440]  states of america to take down the crown jewel of freedom and quote unquote democracy known as the
[3:42:45.440 --> 3:42:51.120]  united states of america don't you dare go away uh we're going to dig in even deeper on the other

[3:47:16.160 --> 3:47:22.960]  I actually came to this show today to deliver this bombshell information believe it or not I got
[3:47:22.960 --> 3:47:28.080]  in touch with the with the team and I said I have this information I listened to Alex's review of
[3:47:28.080 --> 3:47:34.080]  2000 mules the light came on everything connected you know before we get back to that we're going
[3:47:34.080 --> 3:47:41.120]  to learn about Norma is in here and you guys are going to be somewhat shocked to discover the name
[3:47:41.120 --> 3:47:47.440]  Jean Sharp who he is and how he was connected to the downfall of many many dangerous regimes
[3:47:48.160 --> 3:47:55.920]  through peaceful nonviolent color revolutionary methods he invented it but you know I do want
[3:47:55.920 --> 3:48:01.200]  to tell you I'm not just saying this because I'm here I'm so honored to be here especially
[3:48:01.200 --> 3:48:08.960]  after having listened to info wars Alex Jones show for decades and Alex was so instrumental in
[3:48:08.960 --> 3:48:15.680]  helping to awaken me and you know for that matter he taught us all how to do the research go check
[3:48:15.680 --> 3:48:24.000]  the documents don't trust anybody trust that what you research yourself and everything that I was
[3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:29.840]  researching I learned to become an investigative journalist with a set of x-ray vision goggles on
[3:48:30.560 --> 3:48:37.520]  so his t-shirts that are that are selling today I'm getting two of them one it will be preserved

[3:48:46.320 --> 3:48:52.000]  and everybody else he certainly was right I'm getting two shirts limited edition one to wear
[3:48:52.000 --> 3:48:58.480]  out in public of course and one I'm actually going to have in a frame and put it in our our
[3:48:58.480 --> 3:49:05.680]  studios here in FEMA region five in Cincinnati Ohio very very simple go right now listen I mentioned
[3:49:05.680 --> 3:49:11.680]  Jean Sharp and then I say oh Norm Eisen you know it's connected to Jean Sharp how can I make that
[3:49:11.680 --> 3:49:15.200]  connection let's do that right now I'm just going to play this clip it's not going to look as pretty
[3:49:15.200 --> 3:49:21.440]  because it's a different type of file format but you'll be able to hear the audio here listen to what
[3:49:22.480 --> 3:49:28.240]  Norm Eisen left-hand side says about Jean Sharp work of this kind and we were inspired by
[3:49:29.360 --> 3:49:32.320]  other work that's out there including Jean Sharp's
[3:49:32.320 --> 3:49:43.680]  from dictatorship to democracy from dictatorship to democracy that is the
[3:49:43.680 --> 3:49:48.560]  book it's literally a guide that all of these quote-unquote revolutionaries the people and
[3:49:48.560 --> 3:49:54.800]  you know we've always been sympathetic to it I remember back and I think it was 2008 2009
[3:49:54.800 --> 3:50:00.080]  and we'll talk a little about that if we have time how I was involved at the time I was one of
[3:50:00.080 --> 3:50:06.160]  Twitter's early adopters I was actually providing proxies and methods of communication to the Iranian
[3:50:06.160 --> 3:50:12.960]  revolutionaries just because I had that tech experience and had a lot of contacts when I was
[3:50:12.960 --> 3:50:19.680]  one of the top 30 Twitter users back then when they first launched so I've been very sympathetic
[3:50:19.680 --> 3:50:25.520]  to the will of the people to take to the streets the Egyptians they get to the streets in the
[3:50:25.520 --> 3:50:31.840]  millions essentially who are incongruable if they come together in the millions taking to the streets
[3:50:31.840 --> 3:50:38.560]  non-violently of course communist dictatorships crumble it doesn't matter how many guns Chowchesky
[3:50:38.560 --> 3:50:46.000]  had all right there was a candlelight vigil by millions of people who refuse and said
[3:50:46.000 --> 3:50:51.600]  you Chowchesky you want to use your military and you want to come get this pastor laszlo tokes
[3:50:51.600 --> 3:50:58.560]  you got to go through us they held candlelight vigils and the military was very sympathetic
[3:50:58.560 --> 3:51:06.400]  and the military collapsed his bureaucracy collapsed bureaucracies and communism dictatorships
[3:51:06.400 --> 3:51:14.080]  cannot survive well this gene sharp mastered the fine art of doing as follows kind of like in a
[3:51:14.080 --> 3:51:19.680]  Saul Alinsky style he's like the the international Saul linsky how do you get people energized to
[3:51:19.680 --> 3:51:27.040]  get out into the streets to get millions of them out there that's contained in his book it is titled
[3:51:27.040 --> 3:51:34.000]  from dictatorship to democracy I have it just behind me from dictatorship to democracy now
[3:51:35.360 --> 3:51:40.480]  who is norm eisen as a relation gene sharp he's a I don't even know if he's still alive hopefully
[3:51:40.480 --> 3:51:44.560]  he's you know well no not hopefully I shouldn't say that oh that guy is such a dangerous man
[3:51:44.560 --> 3:51:51.840]  he certainly is the tactics by which they get people energized in a Saul linsky style you how
[3:51:51.840 --> 3:51:57.200]  do you get them energized to get to the streets you lie to them you lie to them and you use the
[3:51:57.200 --> 3:52:05.600]  people of these under these dictatorships you use them in just as evil of a way as a dictatorship
[3:52:05.600 --> 3:52:12.080]  would by using the bureaucracies and the guns to point at the people but you use mind control
[3:52:12.080 --> 3:52:17.840]  and give them incentives and essentially lie to them to cause them to say you get to the streets
[3:52:17.840 --> 3:52:22.800]  and we're going to win we're going to have peaceful protests this is done by the CIA gene
[3:52:22.800 --> 3:52:29.200]  sharps methods were adopted by the central intelligence agencies the military and their
[3:52:29.200 --> 3:52:35.280]  psyops as we actually discovered this week on bend out video I saw a video how they're attracting
[3:52:35.280 --> 3:52:43.200]  uh new new recruits to join in the new psyop to operate in the darkness to energize people in
[3:52:43.200 --> 3:52:49.040]  the Saul linsky faction to get to the streets and and topple regimes well guess what they've used
[3:52:49.040 --> 3:52:59.440]  all of those masterful tactics of lying to people they've now used it in a color revolutionary way
[3:52:59.440 --> 3:53:05.840]  here in the united states of america as a matter of fact black is the new orange as they say and
[3:53:05.840 --> 3:53:11.920]  that is not my term and that's not a racist term what we saw with the black lives matter movement
[3:53:11.920 --> 3:53:18.720]  was exactly part of the color revolutionary tactics that were outlined in in norm eisen's
[3:53:20.640 --> 3:53:26.640]  guidebook essentially for how to launch a color revolutionary a color revolution but let me let me
[3:53:26.640 --> 3:53:33.040]  highlight and feature a couple of very important things about who that brookings institute if you

[3:56:37.440 --> 3:56:43.840]  highest levels uh who had been of course as a white hat trying to get out the information
[3:56:43.840 --> 3:56:53.120]  that the doj was in investigating norm eisen for conducting a covert communications operation
[3:56:53.680 --> 3:57:01.040]  in xbox gaming channels and other methods now is this a conspiracy theory no it is not
