[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:31.660]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.660 --> 00:37.500]  we are live ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us it is the 30th
[00:37.500 --> 00:43.860]  day of March 2010 we're gonna be live here for the next four hours coming up
[00:43.860 --> 00:50.220]  in the third hour Peterdale Scott one of the seminal researchers and authors
[00:50.220 --> 00:58.340]  exposing the deep state the COG black ops takeover of our nation and the world
[00:58.340 --> 01:03.460]  will be coming on to talk about a host of issues he also appears in Jason
[01:03.460 --> 01:10.860]  Burmese's new film invisible empire a new world order defined and the main
[01:10.860 --> 01:14.900]  reason I wanted to get him on was because I saw this Reuters story in
[01:14.900 --> 01:23.260]  several other mainstream articles last week where the Russians said why don't
[01:23.260 --> 01:30.060]  you just eradicate the poppy fields and NATO and sent calm and others came out
[01:30.060 --> 01:35.940]  and said we're not gonna kill any of the opium fields we're going to basically
[01:35.940 --> 01:44.620]  protect them this is open narcotics production the only fields they kill but
[01:44.620 --> 01:51.380]  they spray with pesticide or burn are those controlled by tribal groups that
[01:51.380 --> 01:58.860]  do not pay their cut and do not ship their opium out through globalist
[01:58.860 --> 02:03.700]  channels and this is publicly admitted I mean again six months ago I heard them
[02:03.700 --> 02:08.660]  admit all of this basically on BBC but say oh this is what we have to do to
[02:08.660 --> 02:13.220]  work with the Taliban groups to to make sure the bad Taliban doesn't take over
[02:13.220 --> 02:17.220]  we have such an evil government I mean they're just complete narcotics
[02:17.220 --> 02:22.780]  trafficking criminals money launderers Ponzi schemes it's just a criminal
[02:22.780 --> 02:30.540]  free-for-all so that's coming up in the first two hours I'm gonna get into these
[02:30.540 --> 02:36.820]  militia raids around the country because this is the big kickoff of the
[02:36.820 --> 02:41.420]  demonization of the tea parties of gun owners of conservatives of libertarians
[02:41.420 --> 02:46.660]  Anderson Cooper saying this proves the whole federal report the Mayak and
[02:46.660 --> 02:51.300]  Homeland Security reports put out in 2009 this was prescient this was like
[02:51.300 --> 02:56.140]  psychic powers how did the southern primary law center how did the federal
[02:56.140 --> 02:59.820]  government how did Homeland Security know all of this was going to happen
[02:59.820 --> 03:04.860]  because they're behind it they're involved in it they've got provocateur
[03:04.860 --> 03:11.340]  informants involved now sometimes the federal government completely stages
[03:11.340 --> 03:16.980]  events the manufacture it from pillar to post up one side down the other in other
[03:16.980 --> 03:21.540]  cases they just provocateur it and it's always
[03:22.140 --> 03:27.460]  hillbilly bumpkins and you look at the photographs of these Michigan people I
[03:27.460 --> 03:35.500]  mean it's it's unbelievable or it's young black youths you know with half of
[03:35.500 --> 03:40.220]  them being mentally retarded on record on welfare and the feds give them
[03:40.220 --> 03:43.260]  hundreds of thousands of dollars to dress up in camo and march around and
[03:43.260 --> 03:49.780]  they bust them or the feds cook the bomb train the driver help them deliver the
[03:49.780 --> 03:56.780]  bomb protect them to bomb the World Trade Center in 93 but remember last year
[03:56.780 --> 04:10.060]  back in August we're gonna play some clips of this coming up today there's an
[04:10.060 --> 04:18.620]  article up on info wars.com the strange case of Christopher Sickles and the
[04:18.620 --> 04:29.260]  militia raids the Hattari militia and we had the guy on the show and I said you
[04:29.260 --> 04:34.940]  act like a federal provocateur and I said what's gonna happen to you and your
[04:34.940 --> 04:40.220]  body's arm the feds are gonna get you to talk about surveilling a police station
[04:40.220 --> 04:44.860]  and then they're gonna plant a pipe bomb on you and that's in the affidavit
[04:44.860 --> 04:51.540]  that's now happened and people are on the message boards and on the YouTube
[04:51.540 --> 04:55.940]  video saying how did Alex predict this because they have a manual they have a
[04:55.940 --> 05:01.860]  handbook we know exactly how they do this. Hi this is Alex Jones did you know
[05:01.860 --> 05:05.420]  that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[05:05.420 --> 05:09.340]  vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid
[05:09.340 --> 05:12.940]  seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about
[05:12.940 --> 05:16.340]  performing gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could
[05:16.340 --> 05:20.100]  even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together
[05:20.100 --> 05:25.540]  the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can
[05:25.540 --> 05:29.740]  produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family
[05:29.740 --> 05:33.340]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any
[05:33.340 --> 05:37.860]  way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so

[08:06.420 --> 08:21.220]  radio network
[08:21.220 --> 08:31.860]  senators work on bipartisan climate bill they're back emboldened by the
[08:31.860 --> 08:37.700]  passage of the criminal unconstitutional government takeover of
[08:37.700 --> 08:43.700]  health care land of the free home of the brave now replaced with the credo the
[08:43.700 --> 08:51.860]  state is God we're gonna be going over that report also USA Today finds two
[08:51.860 --> 08:55.860]  thirds of Americans in their own poll are against the health care plan and
[08:55.860 --> 09:02.780]  that's one of the lower poll number some polls are now above 80% against it the
[09:02.780 --> 09:06.860]  government being a lawless group of criminals could care less social
[09:06.860 --> 09:16.500]  engineers hell bent on running our lives we now have the indictment we now
[09:16.500 --> 09:29.740]  have the search warrants we now have the grand jury indictment dealing with this
[09:29.740 --> 09:38.820]  Michigan militia group a group based in Michigan one of the feds favorite
[09:38.820 --> 09:45.540]  hunting grounds to set up good old boys is Michigan and I have seen scores of
[09:45.540 --> 09:50.460]  cases where they will find some disgruntled farm owner who's had their
[09:50.460 --> 09:56.980]  property taken the feds will create the militia group and it may take two three
[09:56.980 --> 10:01.580]  four five years to finally get somebody to just shoot their mouth off and say
[10:01.580 --> 10:07.140]  yeah if it ever comes down to it you know we need to go ahead and take out the
[10:07.140 --> 10:12.180]  local police then they hype it up in the media and scare all the little ladies
[10:12.180 --> 10:20.100]  watching CNN and tie it into the tea parties and tie it into yours truly and
[10:20.100 --> 10:27.980]  basically use this as a way to invoke all this fear and get the police all
[10:27.980 --> 10:33.260]  scared and worried about the American people coming after them meanwhile the
[10:33.260 --> 10:39.300]  media placed down the mega threat of the imploding southern border and all the
[10:39.300 --> 10:48.660]  murder for hire going on and police being targeted that's a backburner issue
[10:53.140 --> 11:01.140]  and I've been so right about this for so long I don't sit here marking down all
[11:01.140 --> 11:10.100]  the predictions I've made laying out how these people operate and quite frankly
[11:10.100 --> 11:15.540]  sometimes it's just overwhelming to know how these people are manipulating the
[11:15.540 --> 11:20.580]  population to know what their next moves are to understand it and to see it
[11:20.580 --> 11:25.500]  coming like a freight train that's going to run over our society and to not be
[11:25.500 --> 11:30.660]  able to stop it if we could just get the general public to start researching and
[11:30.660 --> 11:36.060]  start looking at these facts and if we could get mainline Americans to see it
[11:36.060 --> 11:42.780]  as their role and their duty to study the New World Order I mean I mean watching
[11:42.780 --> 11:48.060]  Anderson Cooper Kurt Nemo has a five-minute clip of it up on info wars
[11:48.060 --> 11:53.860]  dot com and an article he's written about it and they got po talk of the
[11:53.860 --> 12:00.980]  Southern Prairie Law Center on there and they're just following a script I've
[12:00.980 --> 12:13.580]  seen it over and over and over again and they are getting ready the federal
[12:13.580 --> 12:17.900]  government the criminals that run it to really stage some horrible events in the
[12:17.900 --> 12:25.220]  next few months and I'm here doing the best job I can trying to expose what
[12:25.220 --> 12:29.740]  they're up to and that's why they're attacking me there's several articles out
[12:29.740 --> 12:39.220]  today trying to tie me in with the militia raids the Hattari militia raids
[12:39.220 --> 12:48.660]  what you have eight people that if I was casting for a Hollywood film for revenge
[12:48.660 --> 12:59.580]  of the nerds five revenge of the goofballs five this would be it and they
[12:59.580 --> 13:02.980]  didn't matter if it's Muslims or black groups or white groups or whatever the
[13:02.980 --> 13:09.780]  case is they always get people who are like children mentally they're in a
[13:09.780 --> 13:16.340]  fantasy land they love dressing up in camo they you know the it's always led
[13:16.340 --> 13:23.140]  by some patriarchal type person who wants to call themselves general or
[13:23.140 --> 13:30.140]  commander and there's so many facets to this the federal government goes and
[13:30.140 --> 13:34.260]  prays on these people and finds these people and hypes them up to shoot their
[13:34.260 --> 13:40.700]  mouths off so that they can then go back to the Congress and say we need all
[13:40.700 --> 13:45.140]  this increased funding for Pentagon operations homeland security operations
[13:45.140 --> 13:50.980]  against the American people and they also pick the most buffoonish groups to
[13:50.980 --> 13:57.220]  build up and hype so that police and military have disdain for what would be
[13:57.220 --> 14:06.780]  a real militia controlled by the local sheriff part of the state government and
[14:06.780 --> 14:15.140]  so that's another facet of it is to make it look ridiculous and then it's also to
[14:15.140 --> 14:18.340]  demonize the Second Amendment
[14:18.340 --> 14:28.140]  but Kurt Nemo's got a article up the strange case of Christopher Sickles and
[14:28.140 --> 14:34.100]  the Hattari militia and you look at a photograph of this guy he looks like
[14:34.100 --> 14:37.740]  somebody to work for the Southern Primary Law Center and we know in these
[14:37.740 --> 14:43.580]  arrests this is five state arrests now and it's expanding out into New York
[14:43.580 --> 14:50.940]  State and just all over the country it becomes basically like a military
[14:50.940 --> 14:56.180]  reenactment club and these are guys who like to dress up run around the woods
[14:56.180 --> 14:59.700]  like that's the place they're gonna be fighting the New World Order I mean the
[14:59.700 --> 15:03.020]  last way you'd want to dress if you were actually fighting the New World Order
[15:03.020 --> 15:06.300]  would be in camouflage running around with a 40-pound pack no you'd be
[15:06.300 --> 15:12.460]  driving along on your tractor in in in overalls with a piece of straw sticking
[15:12.460 --> 15:16.780]  out of your mouth acting stupid I mean if you were really gonna go out and
[15:16.780 --> 15:23.140]  militarily engage people or you'd you'd pull up in a beer truck dressed in the
[15:23.140 --> 15:26.580]  beer company's overalls
[15:29.660 --> 15:34.100]  I mean that's all this is is fantasy land it's I've seen different groups in
[15:34.100 --> 15:39.060]  the Republic of Texas and they just declare themselves president from their
[15:39.060 --> 15:43.460]  trailer house and literally I've seen admirals because they own a boat about
[15:43.460 --> 15:49.660]  a bass boat you're an admiral of you own a bass boat and it's filled with
[15:49.660 --> 15:53.340]  provocateurs filled with federal informants and they go out and they
[15:53.340 --> 15:58.380]  find mentally ill people and they set them up and for years I get up here and
[15:58.380 --> 16:02.180]  warn you and I get the people's emails you're just just trying to discredit the
[16:02.180 --> 16:08.540]  militia you're a big fat you know Zionist or you're working for the Vatican or
[16:08.540 --> 16:15.820]  you're you're a Scientologist or you're just jealous of the militia no watching
[16:15.820 --> 16:23.500]  a bunch of Keystone cop morons running around not realizing this isn't a game
[16:23.500 --> 16:27.100]  you're setting yourselves up to be targeted by the government you're
[16:27.100 --> 16:32.740]  wearing the the the clownish uniform and regalia that the brainwashed police
[16:32.740 --> 16:38.700]  like attack dogs have been trained to alert on and to sick you're nothing but
[16:38.700 --> 16:49.340]  decoys trained moron decoys sent out to train the government attack dogs and I
[16:49.340 --> 16:55.300]  saw this pale horse guy on CNN plugging yours truly I saw him in his YouTube
[16:55.300 --> 16:59.620]  videos and he would have a lieutenant a chubby lieutenant with a gas mask on
[16:59.620 --> 17:05.140]  looking like something out of Laurel and Harding and he was there with a scary
[17:05.140 --> 17:12.700]  voice changer in front of him with some kind of Mac 10 with a long barrel on the
[17:12.700 --> 17:18.820]  end right out of central casting and and I reserve judgment on it I mean I I
[17:18.820 --> 17:24.700]  said my gut told me this guy's a fed I knew how Turner was even he was
[17:24.700 --> 17:28.860]  threatening to tell people to kill police and judges for years and attacking
[17:28.860 --> 17:34.020]  me every day and then and tied in with Sean Hannity early on when Hannity was
[17:34.020 --> 17:38.380]  infiltrating right-wing groups in New York and Long Island and then Hannity is
[17:38.380 --> 17:43.860]  a CIA officer there's no doubt Anderson Cooper is admittedly CIA I just can't
[17:43.860 --> 17:50.420]  stand these people so sick of them and and and they just love setting people up
[17:50.420 --> 17:57.340]  and I've had enough but again they attack me from the top and from below they
[17:57.340 --> 18:01.500]  attack me from supposed grant grassroots as they try to radicalize
[18:01.500 --> 18:08.700]  everybody so that our political message sounds racist and ridiculous and they
[18:08.700 --> 18:13.020]  attack me from the heights saying world government doesn't exist I mean I was
[18:13.020 --> 18:17.500]  watching POTOC and Cooper last night and they said yeah these people they believe
[18:17.500 --> 18:21.740]  there's a world government forming it's delusional meanwhile it's all over TV all
[18:21.740 --> 18:27.300]  over radio all over print a world government's forming and so we interviewed
[18:27.300 --> 18:42.220]  the pale horse who death power and it turns out he wrote a script for a film
[18:42.220 --> 18:53.260]  titled we'll go over coming up the next break about a serial killer that kills
[18:53.260 --> 19:02.540]  kids so he's fantasizing about this stuff and he's dressing up like a third
[19:02.540 --> 19:11.220]  world dictator or like Cobra commander and with a scary voice changer and I had
[19:11.220 --> 19:15.300]  him on and I said look if you're for real and you're not a fed let me tell you
[19:15.300 --> 19:23.460]  how this is gonna end the feds are going to come in and they're gonna
[19:23.460 --> 19:29.580]  provocateur you they're gonna pose as other militias and then you'll all try to
[19:29.580 --> 19:35.300]  get different groups together showing off and making promotional videos about
[19:35.300 --> 19:42.900]  how cool your training is and then they're going to try to get you to talk
[19:42.900 --> 19:47.780]  about well what do we do the police start attacking us and they'll create
[19:47.780 --> 19:52.140]  battle plans and get you to talk about attacking police stations or
[19:52.140 --> 19:55.740]  surveilling them and they're gonna arrest you and plant pipe bombs on you
[19:55.740 --> 20:02.500]  that's now happened we'll be right back great news for pure water lovers the

[24:00.940 --> 24:12.700]  i have studied anthropology psychology i have read scores of
[24:12.700 --> 24:18.540]  propaganda manuals that have been declassified
[24:18.540 --> 24:23.820]  and what the new world order does is it creates lots of different niche groups
[24:23.820 --> 24:27.500]  within government and the corporate structure with different psychological
[24:27.500 --> 24:34.220]  types making up those structures and the average swat team or tactical
[24:34.220 --> 24:38.380]  officer is a hunter they have very strong
[24:38.380 --> 24:43.900]  hunting instincts warrior instincts and they like to hunt people
[24:43.900 --> 24:48.860]  they like excitement most of them are former military people that have seen
[24:48.860 --> 24:54.860]  combat in third world war zones and that's why i've always
[24:54.860 --> 25:00.460]  explained to so-called militia people who like to
[25:00.460 --> 25:03.420]  get on message boards and talk about how tough they are and
[25:03.420 --> 25:06.540]  like to dress up and camouflage and run around and beat their chest talking
[25:06.540 --> 25:11.740]  about war all day i i always try to warn you and
[25:11.740 --> 25:16.940]  explain something to you okay our founding fathers and the militias of
[25:16.940 --> 25:22.140]  1775 and 1776 had lived in villages on the expanding
[25:22.140 --> 25:26.140]  frontier and it had many family members killed
[25:26.140 --> 25:31.100]  in hand-to-hand combat with the native tribes
[25:32.460 --> 25:37.660]  so they were warriors and they'd been in the french and indian war
[25:38.300 --> 25:44.460]  the protracted conflict vicious combat people being scalped people being
[25:44.460 --> 25:48.780]  tortured to death okay that's what george washington came out of
[25:48.780 --> 25:55.740]  as a militia commander all over the frontier
[25:55.740 --> 25:58.940]  for decades
[26:02.300 --> 26:06.780]  now we're here at the cusp of the government trying to start a physical
[26:06.780 --> 26:11.260]  revolution so they can clamp down on our peaceful
[26:11.260 --> 26:14.620]  restoration against their criminal revolution
[26:14.620 --> 26:22.860]  their corporate takeover of america
[26:23.180 --> 26:27.340]  now i have warned you people over and over again that this is not a game
[26:27.340 --> 26:31.820]  what i do here every day putting my life on the line
[26:31.820 --> 26:37.340]  is not a game being the number one enemy being singled out by the adl
[26:37.340 --> 26:40.220]  southern prairie law center and mainstream media right now
[26:40.220 --> 26:46.140]  is not fun it is my duty they have got trained
[26:46.140 --> 26:52.380]  cadres of killers and setup artists and frame-up artists
[26:52.380 --> 26:57.580]  pr firms you name it lined up there have been meetings after meetings after
[26:57.580 --> 27:01.900]  meetings and the highest councils of the system deciding exactly what to do with
[27:01.900 --> 27:06.780]  alex jones and because i've studied history
[27:06.780 --> 27:11.340]  and because i have been focused and i put out such a large body of work
[27:11.340 --> 27:15.580]  they don't know how to come at me and because they are so discredited with the
[27:15.580 --> 27:18.780]  general public when they do attack me they found that it
[27:18.780 --> 27:25.740]  actually backfires on them but i will tell you this i am beyond
[27:25.740 --> 27:32.140]  upset i'm beyond angry i'm just resigned to all of this now and i'm just
[27:32.140 --> 27:38.860]  watching and unfold now
[27:38.860 --> 27:45.740]  i don't hate the police i don't hate the military
[27:45.740 --> 27:54.780]  i'm sad for them i'm sad for these fools they set up
[27:54.780 --> 27:58.460]  because i know they're putting poison in your water police
[27:58.460 --> 28:02.300]  that's not my opinion it's an absolute fact i know they're putting cancer
[28:02.300 --> 28:06.220]  viruses in the vaccines we all take i know they've genetically engineered the
[28:06.220 --> 28:11.020]  major food crops to reduce fertility and to cause cancer
[28:11.020 --> 28:15.420]  it's all been publicly admitted
[28:16.860 --> 28:22.140]  and i know we're in this together whether you know that or not
[28:22.140 --> 28:30.860]  and i'm very sad about it
[28:31.020 --> 28:34.700]  so for years they've been
[28:37.260 --> 28:41.420]  forging the identity of the militia the federal government has done that
[28:41.420 --> 28:48.300]  leading the militias creating the militias running the militias forging
[28:48.300 --> 28:52.620]  the militias that is the public militias
[28:52.620 --> 28:57.580]  that you see on the news every day you weren't really seeing the militias on

[29:10.140 --> 29:14.460]  introducing the terrorists to everyone
[29:14.460 --> 29:22.620]  so they can go to the next stage the next act in the play
[29:25.260 --> 29:29.820]  and i get chills i'm having chills right now
[29:29.820 --> 29:33.740]  when i think about the next phase in this tragedy
[29:33.740 --> 29:38.700]  oh it is a tragedy it's not a comedy it's not an action adventure
[29:38.700 --> 29:43.180]  it's a tragedy for everyone involved

[33:13.820 --> 33:19.020]  all right i want to walk through exactly what the
[33:19.020 --> 33:24.060]  ruling class is doing the operation they are
[33:24.060 --> 33:28.540]  carrying out i want to be very specific on the background
[33:28.540 --> 33:32.780]  the playbook they're going off of how they're setting the stage
[33:32.780 --> 33:38.380]  for the next phase in their operation but i wanted to go back to a
[33:38.380 --> 33:45.020]  august 17th radio slash tv interview i did with a person calling
[33:45.020 --> 33:50.140]  themselves pale horse who's reportedly been arrested
[33:50.140 --> 33:55.420]  as part of this five-state militia raid that's now expanding
[33:55.420 --> 34:02.220]  into other states the headline is the strange case of christopher
[34:02.220 --> 34:07.900]  sickles and the hutari militia
[34:08.380 --> 34:12.860]  and what they do is the feds go in and they infiltrate
[34:12.860 --> 34:17.580]  they create in many cases malicious
[34:17.580 --> 34:21.420]  and they have them operate secretly they create a
[34:21.420 --> 34:26.540]  culture of paranoia the feds separately handle the local police
[34:26.540 --> 34:30.140]  and have the local police start harassing their families
[34:30.140 --> 34:37.100]  to intensify the paranoia so that they can then
[34:37.100 --> 34:41.740]  nationally promote these groups and bust them one after the other
[34:41.740 --> 34:46.540]  to create the perception of this giant phantom menace
[34:46.540 --> 34:52.300]  that must be dealt with so that the larger opposition to government
[34:52.300 --> 34:55.180]  can be demonized and last night on anderson cooper's
[34:55.180 --> 34:59.100]  seeing in they were showing a open carry
[34:59.100 --> 35:05.420]  family picnic flyer and then they were showing clips of tea parties
[35:05.420 --> 35:11.980]  and saying it was the hutari militia who in the affidavit
[35:11.980 --> 35:15.980]  supposedly talked with federal informants about how
[35:15.980 --> 35:23.500]  they were doing drills and simulated scenarios because once they get you in
[35:23.500 --> 35:27.100]  the mindset of okay we're preparing for the beast government to come against us
[35:27.100 --> 35:30.300]  what do we do when they do this well we hit them on
[35:30.300 --> 35:35.580]  our timetable we get the cops to pull us over we kill the cop
[35:35.580 --> 35:38.780]  and then when they have a funeral
[35:38.780 --> 35:45.660]  per session a few weeks later we set up red dawn type
[35:45.660 --> 35:49.500]  crossfire on the highway and kill all the police
[35:49.500 --> 35:54.060]  and again even that which was fed to them by the federal informants is designed
[35:54.060 --> 35:58.700]  to enrage police when they see this on national television and hear about it
[35:58.700 --> 36:03.420]  it's all scripted for maximum effect now they may not have even talked about
[36:03.420 --> 36:05.980]  this we've seen the feds completely manufacture what
[36:05.980 --> 36:09.500]  people supposedly said we know their informants are
[36:09.500 --> 36:13.900]  known for lying and framing people i mean we know dr frederick wires
[36:13.900 --> 36:18.300]  head of the fbi crime lab quit in 96 and won a big lawsuit and it was confirmed
[36:18.300 --> 36:21.900]  that they framed almost everyone if they were given the orders
[36:21.900 --> 36:27.340]  to frame people they just framed them he now runs the national whistleblower
[36:27.340 --> 36:31.340]  association we're going to be getting him on very soon
[36:31.340 --> 36:34.540]  interviewed many years ago and you've seen all the other big police
[36:34.540 --> 36:38.460]  departments caught framing people i mean this is standard operating procedure
[36:38.460 --> 36:42.860]  for law enforcement leadership and it's compartmentalized mainly they have
[36:42.860 --> 36:47.100]  good men and women working at the ground level and then as you go up through the
[36:47.100 --> 36:53.100]  structure it's just absolute duplicitous criminals at the top
[36:53.100 --> 36:57.180]  and if they identify any officers who are good they set them up and run them out
[36:57.180 --> 37:01.420]  of the department and they've almost completely converted
[37:01.420 --> 37:05.100]  the senior leadership to criminality now and that's why they're getting ready to
[37:05.100 --> 37:09.580]  move against the population but to get the lower level ranks
[37:09.580 --> 37:13.180]  to go along with waging war on the american people and having checkpoints
[37:13.180 --> 37:19.900]  and gun confiscation they have to first kill a bunch of cops
[37:19.900 --> 37:24.220]  or attempt to kill a bunch of cops and then hype it up and and so that's part
[37:24.220 --> 37:29.420]  of the phase we're going into but when i saw cnn msnbc fox and others
[37:29.420 --> 37:33.180]  playing video of oh my gosh american militia
[37:33.180 --> 37:36.220]  they're going to get us with people dressed up in
[37:36.220 --> 37:41.100]  what can only be described as potbellied people in cobra commander outfits
[37:41.100 --> 37:44.300]  now wearing gas mask and world war one helmets
[37:44.300 --> 37:48.940]  like something out of money python that i immediately identified that as a
[37:48.940 --> 37:54.540]  multifaceted attack profile again it's meant to make the militias look
[37:54.540 --> 37:59.660]  stupid a law enforcement with untucked uniforms and clown
[37:59.660 --> 38:09.900]  outfits on with the voice changer it's meant to scare the general public
[38:09.900 --> 38:14.220]  and so i began seeing on air that i thought this pale horse guy
[38:14.220 --> 38:19.820]  fit all of the indicators all of the signature points
[38:19.820 --> 38:25.500]  of a fed and they say he's been arrested
[38:25.500 --> 38:28.700]  but now looking at his profile last night in this morning and doing some
[38:28.700 --> 38:31.180]  research
[38:31.740 --> 38:36.860]  he fits the bill of a
[38:36.860 --> 38:41.900]  adam gadan type southern property law center adl deep cover operative
[38:41.900 --> 38:44.620]  we know it came out in federal documents that mcvay was hired as that and
[38:44.620 --> 38:47.820]  they set him up look how they're setting up pal turner so they do
[38:47.820 --> 38:52.060]  burn their own so we're not sure and he could have just been played and
[38:52.060 --> 38:57.820]  handled by someone else but i want to go to
[38:57.820 --> 39:02.220]  several short clips from the 45 minute interview the full interview was posted
[39:02.220 --> 39:05.340]  in the article at info wars dot com the strange case of
[39:05.340 --> 39:10.780]  christopher sickles and the utari militia one of the men arrested in the
[39:10.780 --> 39:15.020]  fbi and homeland security raids on the utari militia
[39:15.020 --> 39:19.180]  in michigan last week appeared on the alex joneshow in 2009
[39:19.180 --> 39:24.620]  after it was widely suspected he was a government operative
[39:26.460 --> 39:31.260]  christopher sickles aka pale horse a reverence of the late william coopers book
[39:31.260 --> 39:34.780]  behold a pale horse is named in the federal indictment against members of
[39:34.780 --> 39:37.420]  the utari militia he was reportedly a member of the
[39:37.420 --> 39:41.020]  ohio militia and see that's how they handle and provocateur
[39:41.020 --> 39:44.620]  other militias is all have pure fed run
[39:44.620 --> 39:49.020]  militias where every member of it is a federal officer there's been federal
[39:49.020 --> 39:53.500]  uh court records come out where they'll have clan meetings with say 14 clan
[39:53.500 --> 39:56.140]  members and every one of them is a federal agent
[39:56.140 --> 39:59.340]  so they've had to learn hand signs there's been many meetings where they
[39:59.340 --> 40:02.940]  just break up the meeting is it's all feds
[40:02.940 --> 40:05.580]  same thing in germany same thing in england that's that's in the mainstream
[40:05.580 --> 40:10.060]  news london guardian you name it that the modern white supremacist groups in
[40:10.060 --> 40:13.980]  germany were founded by the german government not infiltrated not run
[40:13.980 --> 40:18.220]  but found it it turns out he's probably not a government operatives is
[40:18.220 --> 40:22.060]  originally suspected that's curt's opinion i think the jury's out at least
[40:22.060 --> 40:27.100]  not consciously and is instead a mentally ill individual
[40:27.100 --> 40:30.860]  who joined the utari in order to realize his perverse fantasies in
[40:30.860 --> 40:34.380]  october of 08 sickles posted a video on youtube dressed in
[40:34.380 --> 40:38.700]  military fatigues wearing a camouflage balaclava over
[40:38.700 --> 40:43.020]  his face and cradling an air 15 carbine he calls on americans to arm
[40:43.020 --> 40:46.380]  themselves things are bad things are really bad and it's
[40:46.380 --> 40:50.540]  going to get a lot worse our country's in peril he declares the video was viewed
[40:50.540 --> 40:54.460]  more than 70 000 times where youtube removed it in april the following year
[40:54.460 --> 40:58.620]  pale horse posted another youtube video in a second video he calls for a
[40:58.620 --> 41:01.580]  demonstration of at least one million armed militiamen marching on
[41:01.580 --> 41:04.620]  washington no shooting no one gets hurt just a
[41:04.620 --> 41:08.220]  demonstration he explains the only difference from the typical demonstration
[41:08.220 --> 41:12.300]  is will be armed he specifically mentions alex jones in the video
[41:12.300 --> 41:15.900]  soon after the first video drew attention accusations arose that
[41:15.900 --> 41:20.540]  sickles then only known as pale horse was a government operative
[41:20.540 --> 41:24.860]  and his video was specifically designed to portray legitimate state militias in
[41:24.860 --> 41:28.860]  a negative and sinister light in fact the corporate
[41:28.860 --> 41:33.020]  media used the ohio militia video as part of its campaign to demonize the
[41:33.020 --> 41:38.140]  patriot movement no nine on the august 17 2009 alex jones
[41:38.140 --> 41:42.620]  interviewed pale horse or sickles also after the corporate
[41:42.620 --> 41:47.500]  media exploited him as part of a ongoing propaganda offensive
[41:47.500 --> 41:50.060]  this is a quote we're going to play the audio of this coming up
[41:50.060 --> 41:54.540]  either you were doing this to get attention knowing that putting
[41:54.540 --> 41:59.580]  this mystique this voice changer on the video as you call it
[41:59.580 --> 42:02.540]  would make the media pick up on what you were saying
[42:02.540 --> 42:06.380]  because it was useful to them or you are an out of gadan
[42:06.380 --> 42:10.700]  type fed or foundation hired person meant to make the militias look dangerous
[42:10.700 --> 42:17.100]  and fringe and bad said jones members of the hitari militia and federal custody
[42:17.100 --> 42:21.020]  christopher t sickles is second from
[42:21.020 --> 42:25.020]  the left
[42:26.940 --> 42:29.820]  on the second row
[42:34.140 --> 42:38.220]  adam gadan is the american media spokesman for al-qaeda and widely regarded
[42:38.220 --> 42:41.500]  as an intelligence operative gadan is the first american charge of treason in
[42:41.500 --> 42:47.660]  the u.s government since 52 and then it just goes on from there
[42:47.660 --> 42:51.820]  and i just look at these people i mean
[42:51.820 --> 42:55.020]  classic patsy's
[43:00.860 --> 43:05.660]  and the the types the feds try to set up
[43:05.660 --> 43:10.060]  are a type i mean that they all look the same they act the same it's a joke
[43:10.060 --> 43:14.300]  and it's like a fantasy and they're always running around outside their house
[43:14.300 --> 43:18.700]  with guns and looking in the woods and calling each other and driving around
[43:18.700 --> 43:23.420]  their walkie talkies and it's it's like a fantasy
[43:27.580 --> 43:32.700]  what the militia should be doing is getting county sheriffs elected
[43:32.700 --> 43:37.340]  who then deputized them to have soup kitchens and to fight crime
[43:37.340 --> 43:43.820]  and to arrest illegals and to aid police and to to wear clean
[43:43.820 --> 43:48.460]  uniforms and to only uh have members of the militia of the highest
[43:48.460 --> 43:55.020]  standing and no criminal record and of high moral value and intelligence
[43:56.460 --> 44:00.220]  but that's what the government's scared to death of
[44:01.100 --> 44:06.060]  so instead they make it a secretive thing and and and they pick out groups
[44:06.060 --> 44:09.100]  that will look the most ridiculous on the news
[44:09.100 --> 44:15.580]  let's go ahead and play uh the first little clip here of my interview
[44:23.660 --> 44:29.420]  pale horse from august of last year videos he's saying
[44:29.420 --> 44:36.460]  now let's go ahead and play a clip of pale horse here it is
[44:36.460 --> 44:39.340]  and it has nothing to do with the fact that we have a black president
[44:39.340 --> 44:43.340]  i started my group several years ago before we had a black president when
[44:43.340 --> 44:46.540]  bush was in office they're trying to make it look as if
[44:46.540 --> 44:50.380]  all of a sudden uh obama is in office and now all of a sudden these militants
[44:50.380 --> 44:53.660]  are taking up arms i mean a year ago before obama was
[44:53.660 --> 44:56.140]  in office there was all this stuff on youtube
[44:56.140 --> 44:59.980]  there was all these myspace pages alex jones was still doing the same thing
[44:59.980 --> 45:04.460]  that he's doing it's all been the same i'm sure more people have woken up since
[45:04.460 --> 45:10.060]  then but you know it's not the way that the media is portraying us
[45:10.060 --> 45:13.020]  later we're going to play some of the actual newscast
[45:13.020 --> 45:21.260]  where they were demonizing him and uh putting him up there but not really
[45:21.260 --> 45:25.420]  letting him finish a coherent statement uh that way they could just use the
[45:25.420 --> 45:30.300]  scary sounding voice to intimidate people and i would
[45:30.300 --> 45:33.660]  think out of the thousands of militia videos that are out there
[45:33.660 --> 45:38.780]  they probably chose pale horse's video uh because the voice changer he's using
[45:38.780 --> 45:42.140]  to protect his identity does make it sound scary
[45:42.140 --> 45:44.860]  and that's meant to scare little old ladies and people
[45:44.860 --> 45:48.700]  uh living in their inner city crime compounds
[45:48.700 --> 45:52.380]  let's go ahead and go to pale horse right now joining us
[45:52.380 --> 45:56.300]  live we were able to get him on the show because he contacted us
[45:56.300 --> 46:00.300]  mr pale horse so good to have you on with us thank you uh this is an honor
[46:00.300 --> 46:04.220]  definitely now why are you not protecting your
[46:04.220 --> 46:09.180]  voice uh here on the radio orally you know i i get a lot of things on youtube
[46:09.180 --> 46:12.540]  uh all the government knows who you are you know why are you covering your face
[46:12.540 --> 46:16.140]  why are you disguising your voice and really it was more you know i know the
[46:16.140 --> 46:19.660]  fbi and whoever wants if they want to know who i am they know who i am
[46:19.660 --> 46:23.260]  and it was more or less as you know just to give the video a mystique
[46:23.260 --> 46:27.420]  and clearly it worked because i ended up on uh you know corporate news
[46:27.420 --> 46:32.300]  no well let me just be honest with you here out of the gates
[46:32.300 --> 46:36.220]  i told my staff as soon as they saw this last thursday when you emailed us
[46:36.220 --> 46:39.660]  well i've seen it tuesday and wednesday on national television everywhere but
[46:39.660 --> 46:43.580]  then i actually watched some of your videos even before
[46:43.580 --> 46:50.540]  to ascertain and really assess from my research who and what you are
[46:50.540 --> 46:53.820]  and then you contacted us and i said i need some more time to look into this
[46:53.820 --> 46:58.620]  but either you were doing this to get attention
[46:58.620 --> 47:02.300]  knowing that putting this mystique on it as you call it
[47:02.300 --> 47:05.500]  would make the media pick up on what you were saying
[47:05.500 --> 47:12.060]  because it was useful to them or you are a adam gadan type fed or
[47:12.060 --> 47:16.540]  foundation hired person meant to make the militias
[47:16.540 --> 47:21.340]  look dangerous and fringe and bad uh i'm not here
[47:21.340 --> 47:24.780]  judging you i'm not here saying you're a bad person
[47:24.780 --> 47:28.300]  i'm just here to try to really truly assess now
[47:28.300 --> 47:31.980]  talking to you here on air and having more time to look at
[47:31.980 --> 47:35.900]  what you do i think this may be more of an art project
[47:35.900 --> 47:39.900]  and that you uh did this to get attention and that certainly worked but
[47:39.900 --> 47:43.180]  we're going to try to ascertain that here today but instead of me just talking
[47:43.180 --> 47:47.100]  at you pale horse uh tell us a little bit about yourself and
[47:47.100 --> 47:51.340]  uh about your militia and what you guys stand for
[47:51.340 --> 47:54.940]  well basically um we're just a militia group like any other group
[47:54.940 --> 47:58.220]  um i started in the washington state militia
[47:58.220 --> 48:01.740]  and then upon moving back to ohio which is my native state um
[48:01.740 --> 48:05.500]  i began training with the michigan militia and i just got real proactive in
[48:05.500 --> 48:09.900]  the movement and uh you know basically um
[48:09.900 --> 48:14.220]  just started my own group eventually and uh you know i'm just trying to get the
[48:14.220 --> 48:18.620]  word out there and just train to protect protect my family and uh
[48:18.620 --> 48:22.060]  you know i think you have the the wrong idea of you know
[48:22.060 --> 48:26.700]  who i am basically um you know i didn't put the video up to get attention i had
[48:26.700 --> 48:30.300]  no idea that you know it would be as big as it was you know 100 000
[48:30.300 --> 48:34.060]  plus views and being all over the news and everything i thought you just said
[48:34.060 --> 48:37.500]  you wanted mistake well yeah i mean the idea of the video
[48:37.500 --> 48:41.100]  was that mistake but at the same time i had no idea that it was going to go as
[48:41.100 --> 48:45.820]  far as it did you know what i mean i was just telling people to buy guns and uh
[48:45.820 --> 48:48.700]  basically just prepare for what's to come
[48:48.700 --> 48:54.460]  same as you do what are your influences
[48:54.460 --> 48:59.340]  um i'm actually friends with mark cornkey he's one of my big influences i've
[48:59.340 --> 49:02.540]  read the book uh Behold a Pale Horse by William Cooper
[49:02.540 --> 49:05.500]  let me ask you a question did you read the part in there about
[49:05.500 --> 49:10.460]  about holograms and and the aliens filming Jesus in a hologram
[49:10.460 --> 49:14.540]  and flying submarines in the Bilderberg group meeting the arctic circle in
[49:14.540 --> 49:17.500]  submarines yeah i mean you know i've i've heard
[49:17.500 --> 49:20.460]  all that you know the shape-shifting reptilian no no no you're not listening
[49:20.460 --> 49:23.900]  to me i i'm seeing i'm seeing if you actually read that book
[49:23.900 --> 49:28.620]  tell tell me about that book um basically talked about how he was in the
[49:28.620 --> 49:32.860]  navy at one point and uh you know okay
[49:32.860 --> 49:38.300]  bishops come out of the ocean and uh i mean this goes on for 45 minutes when
[49:38.300 --> 49:41.660]  we come back i'm going to play the clip where i specifically
[49:41.660 --> 49:45.180]  talk about how they will set them up and that's actually in the affidavit
[49:45.180 --> 49:49.500]  exactly what we said what happened happened
[49:51.020 --> 49:55.020]  if you're going to form a militia it needs to be out in the open with a code
[49:55.020 --> 49:58.700]  of conduct and you better record your meetings and
[49:58.700 --> 50:03.340]  everything else and be out in the open that we are
[50:03.340 --> 50:07.980]  patriots we are defending america we have a right to defend ourselves
[50:07.980 --> 50:11.820]  against criminals at every level of society
[50:11.820 --> 50:15.020]  but i've seen this over and over again where the feds
[50:15.020 --> 50:20.620]  infiltrate militias or even mainline other organizations land rights groups
[50:20.620 --> 50:24.380]  you name it and they always try to get them to well
[50:24.380 --> 50:27.900]  shouldn't we go surveil the police department should we do an exercise
[50:27.900 --> 50:32.780]  you know just in case things get bad that we know the police movements
[50:32.780 --> 50:37.260]  and then they set you up and tell the police you're trying to kill them and
[50:37.260 --> 50:41.340]  then they put you in prison well that's exactly what happened with
[50:41.340 --> 50:46.460]  this group because they're following a handbook
[50:46.460 --> 50:49.900]  the feds do the same thing over and over and over again we're going to come back
[50:49.900 --> 50:54.060]  with that on the other side then we're going to get into a bunch of other news
[50:54.060 --> 50:57.420]  open the phones up we got peter del scott coming up and webster tarpley

[54:27.420 --> 54:32.700]  arrested as part of the hitari militia out of michigan
[54:32.700 --> 54:37.100]  part of a larger five state raid that appears to continue
[54:37.100 --> 54:44.940]  as we speak here i am in the 45 and interview being specific with him about
[54:44.940 --> 54:50.940]  how militias get set up this is uh august 17th of last year
[54:50.940 --> 54:54.380]  and i'm not knocking you and and and a lot of these militia guys get mad
[54:54.380 --> 54:58.620]  because they want to strut around events and camo and walk around acting tough
[54:58.620 --> 55:03.500]  and it's like some kind of adolescent you know deal or something
[55:03.500 --> 55:06.220]  and i see him go to prism i see him get set up
[55:06.220 --> 55:09.580]  anytime somebody's join the militia yeah we're going to case out the local
[55:09.580 --> 55:13.100]  police station and then you find out it's the cops leading it
[55:13.100 --> 55:16.460]  and they bust you and they put a pipe bomb in your car and it's
[55:16.460 --> 55:20.220]  militias plan to bomb the police station and it comes out six months later in
[55:20.220 --> 55:22.540]  federal court that you weren't planning that
[55:22.540 --> 55:26.300]  but they got the the feds created the viper militia out of a meth dealing
[55:26.300 --> 55:30.780]  toothless biker gang on the west coast so they could have the term viper with
[55:30.780 --> 55:35.580]  militia i've got stacks of news articles here
[55:35.580 --> 55:39.580]  masad double agent is script writer for bin laden tape
[55:39.580 --> 55:43.020]  hardcore zionist adam perlman who once condemned muslims as bloodthirsty
[55:43.020 --> 55:48.300]  terrorists behind latest scam the intel center uploaded the al-qaeda videos
[55:48.300 --> 55:52.700]  with their own watermark with the al-qaeda watermark okay prove
[55:52.700 --> 55:57.500]  so there i am warning him specifically about what they would do to them
[55:57.500 --> 56:01.020]  and it turns out in the affidavit from the grand jury
[56:01.020 --> 56:05.740]  this is exactly what the federal handlers got him to do
[56:05.740 --> 56:10.220]  they will also to protect their assets they will stage the arrest
[56:10.220 --> 56:13.500]  of their infiltrators and then that'll come out later
[56:13.500 --> 56:16.700]  but by then this won't be big news and people will just remember
[56:16.700 --> 56:21.500]  that oh my gosh there's these gun owners out there that want to kill police
[56:21.500 --> 56:26.540]  and the main mission here is to turn the police and military
[56:26.540 --> 56:30.380]  against american gun owners and to get them into a paranoid
[56:30.380 --> 56:34.620]  or an even more paranoid culture i mean folks i would try to just go to urban
[56:34.620 --> 56:40.540]  warfare drills in california in florida and in other states
[56:40.540 --> 56:45.500]  and i would have so-called locals show up and say hey let's go attack the police
[56:45.500 --> 56:49.900]  and i'd say absolutely not get away from me
[56:49.900 --> 56:52.860]  and then i was trying to build a memorial church for all those that died at

[57:14.140 --> 57:18.620]  and he was always trying to infiltrate and provocateur infiltrated some groups
[57:18.620 --> 57:24.380]  here in austin try to provocateur them and then i show up in florida don't tell

[1:00:05.100 --> 1:00:12.380]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:00:12.380 --> 1:00:21.340]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:23.260 --> 1:00:27.420]  it was 1998 when i first started having run-ins with provocateurs
[1:00:30.140 --> 1:00:33.740]  they were going to tear down a veteran's house so we were going to have a community organized
[1:00:33.740 --> 1:00:40.620]  event and try to repair it and they had uh plainclothes cops come in and talk about
[1:00:40.620 --> 1:00:46.220]  hey we need to kill cops and i'd follow them out in the parking lot with a video camera and it'd
[1:00:46.220 --> 1:00:51.260]  be an unmarked cop car and i said why are you doing this we're just trying to help an old man
[1:00:51.260 --> 1:00:58.220]  but see they don't want any community organizations forming the fbi in the 50 60 70s and 80s would
[1:00:58.220 --> 1:01:04.860]  target mainline soup kitchen operations for the poor if it wasn't part of a big tax-free
[1:01:04.860 --> 1:01:09.340]  foundation system they don't want us having any community so they target everyone they
[1:01:09.340 --> 1:01:14.460]  it's declassify the infiltrate mainline churches businesses everyone gets spied on
[1:01:17.820 --> 1:01:21.820]  we've got more spies per capita now that east germany did they've had congressional reports
[1:01:21.820 --> 1:01:28.220]  admitting that it's very shameful and so there i am in brooksville and all i'm trying to do
[1:01:28.940 --> 1:01:32.700]  is talk to neighbors about the military drills and they're saying we're not supposed to talk to
[1:01:32.700 --> 1:01:40.380]  you the army came to our door that's in police state to the takeover
[1:01:43.180 --> 1:01:49.980]  so we're out there and we're just standing up against the fence of the municipal airport
[1:01:49.980 --> 1:01:56.460]  videotaping the drills they were doing of trucks coming in with supposed detainees loading them on
[1:01:56.460 --> 1:02:04.620]  the aircraft taking off they're also doing deployment maneuvers and then they send these
[1:02:04.620 --> 1:02:13.820]  humvees well actually doom buggies off of the facility and we talked to neighbors that you
[1:02:13.820 --> 1:02:21.980]  know saw them driving around looking for us in the woods and then this individual starts getting
[1:02:21.980 --> 1:02:27.020]  down on the ground i say what are you doing he's got a lighter out and he's starting to light grass
[1:02:27.020 --> 1:02:32.860]  on fire and i start stomping out on my foot and i say what are you doing he goes oh i'm setting
[1:02:32.860 --> 1:02:41.820]  a fire as a distraction i said setting a fire we're news media here and i said look i knew when
[1:02:41.820 --> 1:02:46.380]  you showed up here and i've known for the year you've been hanging around in austin that you're
[1:02:46.380 --> 1:02:55.580]  in the military and i said i can look at your haircut your eyes your your build i said look i
[1:02:55.580 --> 1:03:01.820]  know your high-level special forces and he started laughing and he goes i'm gonna set this fire and
[1:03:01.820 --> 1:03:06.620]  i had to shove him down on the ground and i said look you may think you're tough buddy but i'm about
[1:03:06.620 --> 1:03:15.020]  to stomp your guts out okay you're not gonna set me up with this and then and it's all happened
[1:03:15.020 --> 1:03:21.500]  in front of mike hanson he's a witness to this in fact call mike hanson we need to get him on as
[1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:26.620]  a guest about this we need to talk about that i need to go back over my videos and from memory
[1:03:26.620 --> 1:03:31.500]  pull up that guy's name i mean it's just i just what i just told you similar things have probably
[1:03:31.500 --> 1:03:44.940]  happened 20 times to me because to the military i wasn't even a human they were going to
[1:03:44.940 --> 1:03:50.060]  set a fire out there i'm an evil american that wants to show what they're doing i'm the enemy
[1:03:50.780 --> 1:03:55.420]  and so they're gonna set a fire out there to have it on the news that i was setting fires
[1:03:57.820 --> 1:04:03.260]  and i'd probably still be in prison right now
[1:04:06.780 --> 1:04:10.220]  and it's the same thing when my guys went to pittsburgh they call the military
[1:04:10.220 --> 1:04:15.020]  they say we want to come and talk to your information officer they have their press
[1:04:15.020 --> 1:04:19.660]  release they go and they say when can we talk to your spokesman about the military's deployment
[1:04:19.660 --> 1:04:23.500]  they wanted to ask them about posse commentatus they said go wait over there and they waited
[1:04:23.500 --> 1:04:30.300]  for 20 minutes it's all on video it's in police state for the rise of fema coming out next month
[1:04:32.540 --> 1:04:37.420]  and they just said no we'll talk to you tomorrow leave and then they called the police we were
[1:04:37.420 --> 1:04:44.380]  trying to plant bombs or blow up the base we were up at the perimeter we're not even human to these
[1:04:44.380 --> 1:04:49.900]  people i mean look they will frame you they will try to frame you and you've got to protect yourselves

[1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:43.260]  i as a media person go to brooksville florida north of tampa i guess it's a town of 40 something
[1:09:43.260 --> 1:09:47.660]  thousand i'm just guessing off the top of my head a little medium size down in fact pull up population
[1:09:47.660 --> 1:09:53.740]  and guys on google of brooksville florida it'll be bigger now but i want to be precise about that now
[1:09:53.740 --> 1:09:59.820]  mike wasn't listening to the show uh but i called him during the three minute break and said do you
[1:09:59.820 --> 1:10:06.300]  remember that guy's name he goes no but you know we have video of him but i just wanted to i thought
[1:10:06.300 --> 1:10:12.060]  it'd be important with my witness to say on record what happened 11 years ago to illustrate to people
[1:10:12.060 --> 1:10:22.060]  how real this is and how serious this is and that my guys last year went to g20 as press and the police
[1:10:22.060 --> 1:10:26.140]  tried to set him up saying they wanted to attack the military base and that was on record we have
[1:10:26.140 --> 1:10:31.740]  video of this uh with the military and then of course we have lucrodowski on video outside larry
[1:10:31.740 --> 1:10:37.020]  outside larry silverstein's building seven the new one they've built protesting the inside job and the
[1:10:37.020 --> 1:10:42.700]  police come over with his security goons and say we know you're not a terrorist but we're
[1:10:42.700 --> 1:10:47.580]  going to say you've got a bomb and put you in prison for it on video see they've been green-lighted to
[1:10:47.580 --> 1:10:55.100]  frame people to such a level they will say they're going to frame you on tape and this has all the
[1:10:55.100 --> 1:11:00.140]  earmarks in this five state raid on militias now mike i know i haven't given you but two minutes
[1:11:00.140 --> 1:11:06.620]  to try to recall all this you didn't even hear the story i told uh on air earlier i asked you and
[1:11:06.620 --> 1:11:13.500]  you weren't listening uh tell us what happened from start to finish in brooksville mike hanson
[1:11:14.060 --> 1:11:20.460]  my camera guy of many years hello alec glad to hear from me uh what i remember about the
[1:11:21.260 --> 1:11:25.740]  the young man was that he showed up at mount parmel while we were rebuilding the church there as a
[1:11:25.740 --> 1:11:33.420]  volunteer and he actually said he was uh out of the special forces and was on he was either just
[1:11:33.420 --> 1:11:38.940]  out of the military or on leave or something and then while we and by the way i know the type i mean
[1:11:38.940 --> 1:11:45.500]  this guy this is the real deal i mean it wasn't an act go ahead but but he was always trying to
[1:11:45.500 --> 1:11:53.740]  up a boxer tour uh different uh uh thing uh and then when we went to brooksville we actually flew
[1:11:53.740 --> 1:12:01.580]  into i think it was camp or a land or somewhere uh he showed up and a uh it was an unmarked
[1:12:02.620 --> 1:12:09.340]  uh it's like an unmarked police car and uh we didn't have a ride or something i don't know what
[1:12:09.340 --> 1:12:15.500]  happened but uh he showed up at the airport and was just there i would i couldn't believe it he
[1:12:15.500 --> 1:12:24.300]  just was there he drove he said he drove all night to get there or something and continue what happened
[1:12:24.300 --> 1:12:31.020]  next uh and you remember me pulling you aside and going this guy's a fed but but let's surveil him
[1:12:32.060 --> 1:12:37.740]  for some uh reason uh i think it was that we didn't have a hotel room or something and he wanted us
[1:12:37.740 --> 1:12:45.900]  to come over to his uh area and uh i think we ended up uh i i i told you i didn't feel comfortable
[1:12:45.900 --> 1:12:51.340]  with that at all because i you know i knew what was going on and i think we ended up getting away
[1:12:51.340 --> 1:12:57.340]  from him the first day and then he ended up back uh with it now that's what i remember
[1:12:59.180 --> 1:13:06.220]  that's right but but tell folks what happened in brooksville with him uh he was when we got into
[1:13:06.220 --> 1:13:15.100]  the uh base area he was always trying to get attention to us to get us caught while we were
[1:13:15.100 --> 1:13:23.980]  trying to film the uh activities going on there he was uh like setting fires and in uh putting
[1:13:23.980 --> 1:13:30.780]  flashlights into the uh to the airplanes and helicopters to get their attention and and all
[1:13:30.780 --> 1:13:38.140]  kind of things like that now let's be clear one time he's he just kneels down in the bushes
[1:13:38.140 --> 1:13:46.060]  and and and starts starting a fire what happened uh and that's when uh they had a spotlight or
[1:13:46.060 --> 1:13:51.420]  something and we had to start running for our lives and you lost your cell phone i think in the swamp
[1:13:52.460 --> 1:13:56.460]  yeah but mike let's go back what did i do when he started trying to set a fire
[1:13:56.460 --> 1:14:02.620]  uh i think he told him that he was the uh uh provocateur at the time i got mad at him
[1:14:04.220 --> 1:14:08.060]  yeah i because he kept trying to do it and remember i shoved him down on the ground
[1:14:08.060 --> 1:14:12.620]  and i said you may think you're tough special ops but i'm about to stomp your guts out you
[1:14:12.620 --> 1:14:19.420]  don't remember that yeah oh yeah been a long time but i remember so
[1:14:19.420 --> 1:14:25.980]  so and again i've learned a lot more than i would have just waited for the doom buggies
[1:14:26.940 --> 1:14:32.140]  but it was i don't even know why we ran to the swamp i should have just waited for him but who
[1:14:32.140 --> 1:14:38.380]  knows they might have set a fire and then kill both of us and because uh they started uh they had
[1:14:38.380 --> 1:14:45.820]  the helicopters that worked with the uh spotlights that after he did all that uh and so we had to
[1:14:45.820 --> 1:14:49.100]  run to get away from him but that's when they send the doom buggies down
[1:14:51.420 --> 1:14:55.100]  that's when they sent the doom buggies there look mike we cannot procrastinate now that we've
[1:14:55.100 --> 1:15:01.500]  talked about this where is the video the raw video i mean i know i edited it down and put it
[1:15:01.500 --> 1:15:06.300]  in police state to the takeover he's not in that i mean i hadn't talked to you for a while but what
[1:15:06.300 --> 1:15:13.100]  i'm doing alex is i'm going to every single video on vhs before they run and putting it out on the
[1:15:13.100 --> 1:15:19.260]  internet to make sure it gets out there on the internet before uh it runs and i've been doing
[1:15:19.260 --> 1:15:23.980]  that i mean i don't know if you've seen some of the stuff i've put out the u n flag burning
[1:15:23.980 --> 1:15:29.340]  and it's uh it's the point that i just put that u n flag burning out on the air
[1:15:30.860 --> 1:15:37.260]  sorry thank you um what are you in a store mike yeah i had to i had to get some moving blankets
[1:15:37.260 --> 1:15:44.140]  because i'm getting some appliances for a rental i'm actually here in austin and uh what happened
[1:15:45.500 --> 1:15:52.300]  was alex hope uh the u n flag burning i put that out there your speech on the u n flag burning
[1:15:52.300 --> 1:16:00.300]  then i heard uh on the news that they had just arrested the militia group for uh and part of
[1:16:00.300 --> 1:16:08.540]  their uh deal was they were burning u n flag so
[1:16:10.620 --> 1:16:16.780]  well mike i appreciate you coming on on short notice i just uh i know you're in a store and
[1:16:16.780 --> 1:16:20.860]  won't i weren't listening i i just you know i tell people these stories and i want them to know
[1:16:20.860 --> 1:16:25.820]  it's it's the truth i mean this is this is what you get when you just try to go cover an urban
[1:16:25.820 --> 1:16:32.940]  warfare takeover drill i think you're saying that's plain to the people uh it would you'd have to write
[1:16:32.940 --> 1:16:38.700]  a book about what happened that time but there's been a lot of cases and it's still happening where
[1:16:38.700 --> 1:16:43.820]  these provocateurs show up to the doctors of the uh provocateur they showed up the not farmers
[1:16:43.820 --> 1:16:51.340]  tried to stab you yeah i forgot that they were with uh they later admitted that they were federal
[1:16:51.340 --> 1:16:57.260]  informants and they and the woman came in with with a butcher knife that was that was not fun
[1:16:57.820 --> 1:17:06.060]  and uh way back too there was a federal agent that infiltrated uh when i used to have to hire
[1:17:06.060 --> 1:17:12.300]  people uh as workers uh you know he said that he didn't have any money but he had this nice
[1:17:12.300 --> 1:17:18.780]  department and and you found out later that he uh uh you know he was trying to infiltrate your
[1:17:18.780 --> 1:17:22.540]  organization and you know who that is he got on the radio and told you
[1:17:25.100 --> 1:17:31.420]  that's right that guy later admitted he was a fed i just there's such scum there's been quite a
[1:17:31.420 --> 1:17:37.260]  few people and i and i and uh i've i've been trying to be very careful because you know i don't
[1:17:37.260 --> 1:17:45.660]  think it's over yet i i i think they're ramping it up a little bit well mic i appreciate you coming
[1:17:45.660 --> 1:17:50.780]  on i i just thought why should i sit here and say my canton was there why not just get him on and
[1:17:50.780 --> 1:17:55.980]  have him tell the story oh then somebody broke in our hotel room and stole the five hundred dollars
[1:17:55.980 --> 1:18:03.580]  i'd left in there yeah and i think i you know that they found us too i mean they you know they
[1:18:03.580 --> 1:18:09.260]  ended up he ended up finding us over at that other hotel that that same provocateur and while i'm on
[1:18:09.260 --> 1:18:16.940]  here talking about old footage of yours alex what i'm doing is i'm going through the phsk and uh i
[1:18:16.940 --> 1:18:24.300]  got a computer guy uh put trying to get the best quality out of him he's put putting them on my
[1:18:24.300 --> 1:18:29.900]  youtube channel free of charge you can see alex jones when he was uh looking really good

[1:24:37.900 --> 1:24:49.020]  you in a nutshell to break down this psi ops propaganda and how it's working and how they're
[1:24:49.020 --> 1:24:58.220]  carrying it out how they're doing it and we are going to open the phones up specifically
[1:24:58.780 --> 1:25:06.860]  for militia militia members who've had groups try to infiltrate them or who have kicked out
[1:25:06.860 --> 1:25:14.540]  provocateurs folks from michigan ohio indiana and other states where this is happening
[1:25:15.660 --> 1:25:29.340]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 but in a nutshell it's simple the establishment politically
[1:25:30.300 --> 1:25:35.500]  is engaged in revolution against the constitution the bill of rights they're engaged in treason
[1:25:35.500 --> 1:25:41.740]  and they know what they've done politically is political suicide unless they stage terror attacks
[1:25:41.740 --> 1:25:46.380]  and provocateur events to demonize their opposition and who are they going to demonize the tea
[1:25:46.380 --> 1:25:51.260]  parties with the airplane attack and the pentagon shooting and now with these militias and i
[1:25:51.260 --> 1:25:57.340]  told you months before all this started this would heat up in march and april and i believe it is
[1:25:57.340 --> 1:26:05.900]  going to peak in this next level in late april because i've seen them do it over and over again
[1:26:05.900 --> 1:26:10.620]  i have experienced it you know i psychologically pretty much have suppressed all the stuff i've
[1:26:10.620 --> 1:26:16.780]  been through i mean mic just reminded me how some woman came at me with a huge butcher knife and i
[1:26:16.780 --> 1:26:21.820]  jumped out of the way and she said i'm gonna kill you i'm a fed there's nothing you can do and then
[1:26:21.820 --> 1:26:28.220]  the police showed up minutes after no one had called him saying you behaving like i'd done
[1:26:28.220 --> 1:26:34.220]  something wrong i guess they were ready to kill me or stab me and then say that say that i had
[1:26:34.220 --> 1:26:43.420]  attacked them i just i just and it's happened so many times i mean i can't go to a book signing
[1:26:43.980 --> 1:26:50.380]  a video signing at a movie theater at a bookstore at a gun show without somebody walking up you
[1:26:50.380 --> 1:26:55.980]  know informant types you know what a criminal looks like it's in the eyes it's in the demeanor
[1:26:55.980 --> 1:27:00.780]  it's in the predatoryness you know what a federal agent looks like you know what a state police
[1:27:01.900 --> 1:27:06.060]  informant looks like what a state police intelligence officer looks like you know what
[1:27:06.060 --> 1:27:13.740]  a special ops looks like you know what a national security level uh delta operator looks like you
[1:27:13.740 --> 1:27:20.060]  know what a navy seal looks like i remember when i was down there covering the protest during the
[1:27:20.060 --> 1:27:24.860]  contested election in 2000 at the governor's mansion and they'd have secret service guys come over
[1:27:24.860 --> 1:27:30.300]  dressed in plain clothes and i go your secret service and they'd laugh and say i am jones and
[1:27:30.300 --> 1:27:35.740]  just shove me and then i'd they'd have another guy walk up and i'd go you're a navy seal and the guy
[1:27:35.740 --> 1:27:41.100]  would laugh and go hi hi hi jones and just walk on by you're i mean i just know these people i've
[1:27:41.100 --> 1:27:47.580]  been around them so much i know all the different groups most these navy seal operators because
[1:27:47.580 --> 1:27:52.780]  for some reason they pick them really small i mean they found that that's a i guess it's a
[1:27:52.780 --> 1:27:59.660]  napoleonic complex and they're like and a lot of their psychological things go into it it's a
[1:27:59.660 --> 1:28:04.140]  whole body type it's everything i've just been around it so much i mean they don't even hide it
[1:28:04.140 --> 1:28:09.660]  they'll have they'll have navy anchors on their shoulders i mean it's not even they think you're
[1:28:09.660 --> 1:28:19.820]  so stupid that's like governor ventura when he uh two weeks into office they call him into the
[1:28:19.820 --> 1:28:24.060]  bottom of the basement of the capital there's 23 CIA officers there basically trying to boss him
[1:28:24.060 --> 1:28:30.860]  around i mean folks it's such a police state the government's so evil it's trillions in weapon sales
[1:28:30.860 --> 1:28:37.580]  trillions in drug sales illegal and legal they got cps rings kidnapping kids for the elite it's

[1:33:17.660 --> 1:33:26.220]  tried to provocateur or set you up for your political activities 1-800-259-9231 but on a
[1:33:26.220 --> 1:33:34.860]  separate issue last friday cnn called me by the way we are simulcasting now at prisonplanet.tv
[1:33:34.860 --> 1:33:39.260]  in the last two and a half hours of the show last friday cnn called towards the end of the show and
[1:33:39.260 --> 1:33:43.900]  so we want to put you live on tonight by the time i got off air it was oh we want you to come down
[1:33:43.900 --> 1:33:49.020]  in an hour and do a taping via satellite from a satellite uplink office down by the capital
[1:33:51.260 --> 1:33:55.820]  and i said let me guess you'll interview me 10 15 20 minutes and 30 seconds will end up being
[1:33:55.820 --> 1:34:00.940]  in the show and they said it is a show about you are you causing violence and notice they're doing
[1:34:00.940 --> 1:34:05.500]  this right ahead of the weekend raids guaranteed they were queued in that's basically all seeing
[1:34:05.500 --> 1:34:10.700]  it's covering right now is the evil militias worse than al-qaeda evil american gun owners are
[1:34:10.700 --> 1:34:15.420]  everywhere we've got to have naked body scanners on the streets oh my god the militia is so deadly
[1:34:15.420 --> 1:34:20.860]  meanwhile the mexican mafia is killing hundreds of people every few days in the us thousands every
[1:34:20.860 --> 1:34:26.860]  few weeks it's thousands every few weeks now uh in mexico that's not a problem an actual real threat
[1:34:26.860 --> 1:34:35.820]  no it's this imaginary fake militia that they provocateur and created to then demonize the
[1:34:35.820 --> 1:34:42.300]  idea of an armed citizenry so all of this is coming together i'm the big enemy of all these tv
[1:34:42.300 --> 1:34:47.980]  networks now and newspapers and magazines london guardian new york times time magazine newsweek
[1:34:49.100 --> 1:34:53.260]  i'm calling for violence i'm of course none of it's true i'm saying don't be violent and i'm
[1:34:53.260 --> 1:34:58.460]  exposing how much of this is provocateur and i'm exposing false flag terror and how they're building
[1:34:58.460 --> 1:35:06.380]  up for a repeat of 1995 this april all the indicators are there and you've seen i've been right
[1:35:06.380 --> 1:35:10.940]  this far if we get the word out we might be able to blow their operations that's why they're mad
[1:35:11.980 --> 1:35:17.660]  and yes i'm in danger folks i mean 11 years ago i had them trying to set me up
[1:35:17.660 --> 1:35:23.180]  they just somebody just shows up on there with a video camera and they start lighting fires
[1:35:25.900 --> 1:35:28.140]  saying i did it and i'm like stomping on it
[1:35:30.620 --> 1:35:34.940]  so this is real okay i live in the real world you're not tuned into entertainment
[1:35:34.940 --> 1:35:39.180]  you're not tuned into somebody who's here just to be a big radio host okay i'm putting my life
[1:35:39.180 --> 1:35:43.340]  on the line here to warn you because you are the target if they're able to bring the system in it's
[1:35:43.340 --> 1:35:48.460]  like hitler beta tested stuff on jews and a few other unpopular minorities but really it was for
[1:35:48.460 --> 1:35:54.140]  everybody so they're beta testing this right now on muslims on gun owners on conservatives on
[1:35:54.140 --> 1:35:59.020]  libertarians they tell conservatives we're doing it to stop muslims they tell the liberals we're
[1:35:59.020 --> 1:36:05.100]  doing this to stop the evil gun owners but the main target of this is the american conservative
[1:36:05.100 --> 1:36:09.020]  or libertarian or gun owner we know the democrats have been caught in denver in other areas attacking
[1:36:09.020 --> 1:36:16.060]  their own offices that's the denver post almost all of this is provocative or completely staged now
[1:36:17.100 --> 1:36:23.740]  i go on seeing in you know it's a taped interview and i taped it because i don't want to take me
[1:36:23.740 --> 1:36:28.540]  out of context and i said in the youtube video from friday i said i don't even know if they're
[1:36:28.540 --> 1:36:32.540]  going to air this they said they were but in my experience that they've interviewed me before
[1:36:32.540 --> 1:36:39.660]  they don't air it and then the spin machine went into the conspiracy theory that i staged this and
[1:36:39.660 --> 1:36:45.980]  i wasn't interviewed by cnn like i care about being interviewed by cnn folks i'm on bbc russia today
[1:36:45.980 --> 1:36:50.780]  fox i mean i've been i've been on cnn i don't know probably 10 times over the years it does nothing
[1:36:50.780 --> 1:36:59.660]  no traffic to the website they always take it out of context it's the mouse that roared their top
[1:36:59.660 --> 1:37:05.500]  shows have a million viewers most of their shows have 200 000 a big radio show in chicago has more
[1:37:05.500 --> 1:37:13.820]  than the average cnn show rush limbaugh has got 10 million a day no i was interviewed by cnn
[1:37:15.660 --> 1:37:21.820]  but it's so pathetic that people would when i made it clear that they taped it i don't know if
[1:37:21.820 --> 1:37:25.900]  they're gonna air it but i'm showing you what i said to them i'm showing you what really gets said
[1:37:25.900 --> 1:37:30.860]  that and then but it doesn't matter anything and everything i do gets attacked but i thought i'd do
[1:37:30.860 --> 1:37:34.380]  this because i wanted to call them anyways and i've gotten busy and didn't do it yesterday
[1:37:34.380 --> 1:37:39.820]  i want to call the cnn producer that called me right now live on air we'll see if she answers
[1:37:39.820 --> 1:37:44.220]  if not we'll try back later and i'm gonna ask you said that was going to air that night is it
[1:37:44.220 --> 1:37:51.580]  going to air and then you can later call justine redmond uh if you won't i mean if she won't uh
[1:37:51.580 --> 1:37:58.620]  tell us what's going on you're welcome to call her so go ahead and call justine redmond cnn producer
[1:37:58.620 --> 1:38:04.780]  right now live on air and i also told people the name of the production company uh the satellite
[1:38:04.780 --> 1:38:09.180]  uplink facility what's the name of it again ray guy productions ray guy productions at austin
[1:38:09.180 --> 1:38:16.460]  four o'clock friday and um hey is this uh justine redmond it is hey listen this is alex jones i just
[1:38:16.460 --> 1:38:19.740]  needed to get this on record because some people were saying i wasn't even really interviewed
[1:38:19.740 --> 1:38:26.140]  by cnn we're live right now you guys did interview me friday correct we did and uh how come you didn't
[1:38:26.140 --> 1:38:31.740]  air it um i think we had some breaking news that night um and had to change the show around but
[1:38:31.740 --> 1:38:38.460]  we're hoping we can air tonight oh really tonight yeah and uh of the 15 minute interview what about
[1:38:38.460 --> 1:38:47.500]  30 seconds um i haven't timed it out it's a pretty long story by our standards but i mean how long
[1:38:47.500 --> 1:38:53.260]  am i in the piece i'd have to go and check well i appreciate you talking to us just one more question
[1:38:53.260 --> 1:38:57.420]  did you guys get tipped off by the feds about the militia raids coming up is that why
[1:38:57.420 --> 1:39:01.500]  you interviewed me friday so you could have me involved in that no absolutely not
[1:39:03.580 --> 1:39:09.820]  did did you guys enjoy the interview oh yes it was very interesting thank you
[1:39:09.820 --> 1:39:16.700]  thank you well have you uh seen the youtube posting because i shot video of my questions
[1:39:16.700 --> 1:39:22.140]  and my answers no i haven't i mean we don't have the questions on tape we just shot with a little
[1:39:22.140 --> 1:39:27.820]  camera flip phone but my responses because i wanted people to actually see what i had to say
[1:39:27.820 --> 1:39:34.700]  and not out of context great no i haven't seen it so is this so this is probably gonna air tonight
[1:39:34.700 --> 1:39:41.820]  on anderson cooper it's looking that way at the moment as you know um live broadcast can change
[1:39:41.820 --> 1:39:47.500]  very quickly but that's the plan so far yeah uh friday night i guess you guys doubled down and
[1:39:47.500 --> 1:39:55.900]  did what 30 minutes on sarah palin did we is uh she is bigger ratings get her as uh as anderson
[1:39:55.900 --> 1:40:03.820]  swimming around with sharks i don't know about that hey what was joe's full name the guy that interviewed
[1:40:03.820 --> 1:40:09.740]  me uh he's our correspondent joe john well i wanted to be clear because i got cut off right
[1:40:09.740 --> 1:40:15.500]  there at the end when i was saying protect ourselves from cnn scum i meant particularly those
[1:40:15.500 --> 1:40:23.260]  that helped promote the wmd hoax uh with uh the bush administration in 2000 and 2002 2003 i wasn't
[1:40:23.260 --> 1:40:28.460]  i wasn't saying you're all bad or evil i was just getting upset by the question over and over again
[1:40:28.460 --> 1:40:33.820]  you know are you causing the violence do you feel guilty for this that was of i mean you
[1:40:33.820 --> 1:40:40.220]  can imagine all i call for is non-violence here and so i've kind of gotten to the point where
[1:40:40.220 --> 1:40:45.260]  it's a pet peeve kind of rubs me the wrong way when that happens well we have to ask you the
[1:40:45.260 --> 1:40:50.860]  question to give you the chance to to state your position so um we're just trying to
[1:40:50.860 --> 1:40:59.180]  to to be fair and get your statements in the story let me guess the point about if redcoats come
[1:40:59.180 --> 1:41:02.780]  marching up your street firing at you you have a right to defend yourself is that what's going to
[1:41:02.780 --> 1:41:12.220]  be on the news tonight um no that actually isn't one of the parts we use it's pretty close i think
[1:41:12.220 --> 1:41:20.780]  we use part of that answer but not that um oh you use the malcolm x part no i think the part about um
[1:41:22.380 --> 1:41:26.460]  oh i mean you're catching me without a script in front of me and of course friday seems like a
[1:41:26.460 --> 1:41:32.300]  long way away i i i shouldn't try and quote you off the top of my head because um no no no don't
[1:41:32.300 --> 1:41:39.740]  mean i mean i mean just in a generality we're just curious here well um then the best thing i
[1:41:39.740 --> 1:41:45.580]  could do is suggest you watch the show tonight well hey you'll probably get some higher ratings
[1:41:45.580 --> 1:41:52.620]  because i've got several million listeners we look forward to that so so uh i saw some web
[1:41:52.620 --> 1:41:57.980]  comments that people were contacting cnn just to be clear though you're a cnn producer and i did
[1:41:57.980 --> 1:42:03.580]  not hoax the fact that you guys interviewed me absolutely not we came to you and wanted to
[1:42:03.580 --> 1:42:09.820]  interview you for our story all right well uh so you think it's gonna air tonight and let me guess
[1:42:09.820 --> 1:42:17.340]  i'll be mixed in with the uh beverly hillbillies that the feds set up up there in michigan not in
[1:42:17.340 --> 1:42:24.620]  this piece no oh really wow well i'm so is this just mainly about the tea parties then no it's
[1:42:24.620 --> 1:42:31.900]  really about you and various numbers of congress and of course the bottom line there is i guess you
[1:42:31.900 --> 1:42:36.700]  guys are setting the parameters of debate saying you know does it add credence to the radicals
[1:42:36.700 --> 1:42:40.380]  that congressmen come on this radio show is this dangerous i mean are you guys
[1:42:40.380 --> 1:42:44.380]  well kind of like the grand gatekeepers that are gonna because i've seen other pieces on fox
[1:42:44.380 --> 1:42:51.740]  and cnn where they've attacked gohmert and and others for coming on my show uh you you did contact
[1:42:51.740 --> 1:42:59.500]  gohmert and ron paul for this piece didn't you uh yes ron paul we saw him briefly and he said he
[1:42:59.500 --> 1:43:04.860]  didn't have time to talk to us about it and what was it why are you going on the radical
[1:43:04.860 --> 1:43:11.580]  alex jones's show is that what what you were asking uh no i don't think that's quite how we put it
[1:43:14.620 --> 1:43:18.940]  but no i don't think we're trying to set any parameters i think actually our story what we're
[1:43:18.940 --> 1:43:23.980]  trying to do is um ask the question about what the parameters should be
[1:43:23.980 --> 1:43:31.420]  you know though justine uh this could be all staged as well maybe you're not really a scene
[1:43:31.420 --> 1:43:39.740]  in producer maybe sometimes i wake up and i can't quite believe it myself well you know here's
[1:43:39.740 --> 1:43:44.620]  what's going on i'll let you guys know you're busy see i've been successful at waking people up
[1:43:44.620 --> 1:43:50.060]  because i do cover what i can prove and my track record of predictions has been very accurate uh
[1:43:50.060 --> 1:43:58.140]  did you just did you know that i actually interviewed one of the uh leaders uh of the militia uh pale
[1:43:58.140 --> 1:44:03.820]  horse that his real name is uh sickles did you know in fact i'm looking no i didn't know that
[1:44:04.460 --> 1:44:09.820]  yeah it's up it's up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com well it was back on august
[1:44:09.820 --> 1:44:15.740]  17th of last year in fact guys will you pull up curt nemo's story about that uh the strange case of
[1:44:15.740 --> 1:44:24.540]  sickles i predicted i said you guys are probably going to be set up with a fake uh intel gathering
[1:44:24.540 --> 1:44:29.740]  operation against a police station and the reason i knew that is that that's what the feds always do
[1:44:29.740 --> 1:44:35.580]  is they go in and radicalize militias and actually provocateur them i mean are you familiar with
[1:44:35.580 --> 1:44:40.780]  1993 when the feds cook the bomb train the driver in the world trade center bombing i'm familiar with
[1:44:40.780 --> 1:44:45.340]  the world trade center bombing yet but i mean the new york times article and the released audio tapes
[1:44:45.340 --> 1:44:50.220]  of the federal informant a mod salon being ordered to to build a real bomb and let it go forward
[1:44:52.780 --> 1:44:54.140]  not so sure i'm familiar with that
[1:44:56.940 --> 1:45:02.540]  well here's the article just in case you want to go pull the the the the interview we did uh with
[1:45:02.540 --> 1:45:08.780]  christopher sickles are you familiar with his name no well he's supposedly one of the people
[1:45:08.780 --> 1:45:16.300]  rounded up in these militia and and and he's the pale horse okay and uh of all the 400 plus militia
[1:45:16.300 --> 1:45:21.100]  groups i said on air i believe there's operatives in this group maybe even the pale horse and that
[1:45:21.100 --> 1:45:25.180]  they're going to be set up and that they will target police because that's what the feds want
[1:45:25.180 --> 1:45:30.300]  is to create a perception that police are being targeted so that they can then swing the homeland
[1:45:30.300 --> 1:45:35.420]  security apparatus around on the american people and say oh look the mayac and homeland security
[1:45:35.420 --> 1:45:41.660]  reports they're coming true well it's coming true because this is being manufactured like texas
[1:45:41.660 --> 1:45:48.380]  monthly reported in 1998 did did you ever read that article about how they created a fake clan
[1:45:48.380 --> 1:45:53.500]  group try to get them to create uh to carry out terror attacks the fbi no i don't think i saw that
[1:45:54.780 --> 1:45:58.940]  okay well listen you've been very very kind uh what time in the show is this gonna air or we
[1:45:58.940 --> 1:46:05.420]  don't know just nine o'clock central ten o'clock eastern that's right yeah yeah and i wish i could
[1:46:05.420 --> 1:46:10.460]  guarantee that it will air because it um it got it's already been held up just because of because
[1:46:10.460 --> 1:46:15.980]  that's the nature of live live news but um fingers crossed it'll be on tonight if it doesn't air tonight
[1:46:15.980 --> 1:46:22.380]  then it's not gonna air no i wouldn't say that okay well listen thank you for speaking with us and
[1:46:22.380 --> 1:46:29.340]  i appreciate uh uh justine redmond for talking to us from seeing in all right thank you take care okay
[1:46:29.340 --> 1:46:33.580]  there you go ladies and that and now it was just deep and they'll say that was not seeing in that's
[1:46:33.580 --> 1:46:41.580]  his wife because that's the conspiracy theorist i'm bill hicks i'm a reptoid uh i work for the
[1:46:41.580 --> 1:46:47.580]  vatican i work for israel i'm a scientologist no i'm none of those things i'm a red blooded american
[1:46:47.580 --> 1:46:51.980]  and a texan who's defending my republic okay i got peter dill scott come up and i said i'd take
[1:46:51.980 --> 1:46:59.340]  your calls uh you know i i i knew seeing in probably wouldn't air it and it remains to be
[1:46:59.340 --> 1:47:06.220]  seen if they will so i thought we're in a hurry uh most the other guys had to leave it was friday
[1:47:06.220 --> 1:47:10.860]  they wanted to go cash their checks and craig who's not really one of our camera guys i said can you
[1:47:10.860 --> 1:47:15.420]  come with me and he said yeah yeah i've got to go engineer for a band tonight he does that in this
[1:47:15.420 --> 1:47:22.620]  hard time he's a great engineer sound engineer and so uh not his best camera work for friday but
[1:47:23.180 --> 1:47:27.260]  he's like 15 feet away with a camera zoomed in it it's really hard as they shake i mean i'm a pretty
[1:47:27.260 --> 1:47:32.540]  good camera guy and it's hard the point is so we just thought we'd shoot it and show you you know
[1:47:32.540 --> 1:47:37.900]  lisa wouldn't be a waste of time driving downtown and then that gets spun by co and tell pro and
[1:47:37.900 --> 1:47:43.340]  operas because they don't want people to have a debate about the issues i put forward in that
[1:47:43.340 --> 1:47:52.940]  seeing an interview it's got over 200 000 views in the three different versions of the video
[1:47:52.940 --> 1:48:00.700]  i've seen just on youtube alone uh let's go ahead and uh talk to who who who who's a militia member
[1:48:00.700 --> 1:48:05.500]  here all right we'll go to kevin and boston then we're gonna go to tim and michigan's got intel
[1:48:05.500 --> 1:48:11.420]  from the ground chris scotty dan and others uh kevin you're on the air go ahead thank you uh
[1:48:11.420 --> 1:48:15.980]  for taking my call alex um when when you ask for call for a militia i just wanted to point out
[1:48:16.700 --> 1:48:22.300]  section 13 of the u.s. code title 10 is entitled militia composition in its classes
[1:48:22.860 --> 1:48:29.660]  and i know 18 to 45 and i know it's federal law that we're all in the militia and and i under that's
[1:48:29.660 --> 1:48:34.620]  why they're creating these ridiculous militias to make us look stupid well that's it but i don't
[1:48:34.620 --> 1:48:39.180]  want to make fun of you know i i trust your investigation into these things that's what
[1:48:39.180 --> 1:48:44.460]  you do i don't want to you know call anyone rid else ridiculous because i i know that they can
[1:48:44.460 --> 1:48:48.780]  defame all of us um they're very effective at that and i don't know who to believe in what to
[1:48:48.780 --> 1:48:53.820]  believe other than my own person yeah but i've interviewed members of this militia and out of
[1:48:53.820 --> 1:48:59.980]  the 400 groups i said red alert dangerous group being shut up i mean i i'm not trying to identify
[1:48:59.980 --> 1:49:04.860]  with them i just think um and you know i i worry about my own actions or i don't think so i'm not
[1:49:04.860 --> 1:49:10.300]  i'm not disagreeing with you um and and i'm not affiliated with them in any way i mean i post on
[1:49:10.300 --> 1:49:17.180]  awrm.org um and i would encourage people that are interested in the concept of the militia not to
[1:49:17.180 --> 1:49:22.140]  go join any group but to study leaderless real resistance and to read the national militia
[1:49:22.140 --> 1:49:29.580]  standards which can be found on awrm.org um yes i've had a provocateur attempt i believe i haven't
[1:49:29.580 --> 1:49:33.980]  proven that i don't have the resources that you have to look that i just disassociated and got
[1:49:33.980 --> 1:49:40.220]  myself out of a situation but um they're out there and and that's why um it's much more effective
[1:49:40.220 --> 1:49:45.180]  you know things are going very well for us um there's 14 million guns sold in america 14
[1:49:45.180 --> 1:49:51.020]  billion rounds of ammunition in this past year um people need to that are you know we are nonviolent
[1:49:51.020 --> 1:49:56.300]  these are you know only for defensive purposes and what people really need to be doing is just
[1:49:56.300 --> 1:50:01.980]  doing what they're doing getting the word out waking everyone else up being prepared by storing food
[1:50:01.980 --> 1:50:06.220]  for emergencies it could be katrina it could be some of the floods we're experiencing up here
[1:50:06.220 --> 1:50:11.500]  in the northeast right now being independent minded is it's not a bad thing it's we're not evil
[1:50:11.500 --> 1:50:16.460]  and um you know i just watched on irish catholic i just watched the movie michael columns about the
[1:50:16.460 --> 1:50:21.660]  irish easter uprising that was just on again and you know at the end of the movie this it seems
[1:50:21.660 --> 1:50:26.780]  sad if you're from irish uh if you're irish catholic and you're sympathetic to the uh
[1:50:26.780 --> 1:50:32.460]  easter uprising when um first michael bowland is killed and then michael commons has killed
[1:50:32.460 --> 1:50:38.940]  in the run opposite ends of a civil war but then as it closes you remember that look they achieved
[1:50:38.940 --> 1:50:45.180]  their goal of of a free republic and they made peace and and with with with england
[1:50:45.180 --> 1:50:49.820]  and the you know ended a lot of the violence and that's the we know this if we don't stand up

[2:01:21.980 --> 2:01:28.540]  i mean specifically being there in michigan what what other info do you have okay um
[2:01:28.540 --> 2:01:32.700]  anyway what happened is is is well i talked to one of the guys i was actually on one of their
[2:01:32.700 --> 2:01:39.980]  broadcast last night and later that day it was still sunday right the fbi had told somebody
[2:01:39.980 --> 2:01:46.140]  at one of the it's claiming to be fox blogged on the website that the reason they these people
[2:01:46.140 --> 2:01:50.940]  arrested were for making and selling pipe bombs now if these were sealed documents and this was
[2:01:50.940 --> 2:01:56.780]  still sunday when this blog showed up on the on the website if these were sealed documents
[2:01:56.780 --> 2:02:02.940]  and this was sunday and they were all to be open until monday okay how did this blog end up on
[2:02:02.940 --> 2:02:12.460]  the website you know thing that i've seen i've seen i've seen on police footage um ferrell
[2:02:12.460 --> 2:02:18.300]  montgomery was one of the cases out in phoenix they got jumper cables out on the news from his
[2:02:18.300 --> 2:02:24.460]  rv and said look pipe bombs they will say a can of gasoline is a pipe bomb they will say a toothbrush
[2:02:24.460 --> 2:02:29.820]  is a pipe bomb they will say a canary is a pipe bomb they will say an easter bunny is a pipe bomb
[2:02:29.820 --> 2:02:35.580]  and you know they'll just walk in your house pick up a telephone and go this pipe bomb
[2:02:37.020 --> 2:02:42.300]  see this this this kills police this is a i mean people have to understand the police
[2:02:42.860 --> 2:02:48.780]  frame people out of hand and that is very suspicious and i had seen reports of that that
[2:02:48.780 --> 2:02:53.740]  this was known a day before the indictment was even released but you know that can happen but
[2:02:53.740 --> 2:03:00.220]  uh we need to track down who exactly put this on the blog right right and then uh something about
[2:03:00.220 --> 2:03:05.980]  our local news now check this out and i quote local news uh with saying uh of course that
[2:03:05.980 --> 2:03:11.020]  just like he said they plan to kill cops and uh then they were going to uh raid the funeral
[2:03:11.020 --> 2:03:18.380]  processions and attack more cops and i quote she said with weapons of mass destruction no no that's
[2:03:18.380 --> 2:03:23.420]  that's in the affidavit said that well see now a gun is a weapon of mass destruction first it was
[2:03:23.420 --> 2:03:29.260]  nukes but now that now that they need to invade countries that they have guns i guess a 22 hand
[2:03:29.260 --> 2:03:34.700]  gun is is a nuke now and oh yes they had to see they know the public's dumbed down so it's just
[2:03:34.700 --> 2:03:42.300]  malicious kill cops wmds they want to do attack a funeral possession but but you're saying that
[2:03:42.860 --> 2:03:47.820]  these people are all together at awake and that's what the cops actually rated yes it was awake
[2:03:47.820 --> 2:03:54.220]  they wanted their phone comrad column which will had passed away and they were gathered there at
[2:03:54.220 --> 2:03:59.260]  awake now i got a lot of stuff it's gonna really blow you out of your out of your shoes here um
[2:04:00.460 --> 2:04:07.500]  they are specifically uh in the yesterday to there were skating back um didn't use the term
[2:04:07.500 --> 2:04:13.980]  arraignment they used the term detention hearing and uh there was this is uh the news uh local
[2:04:13.980 --> 2:04:19.260]  news reporting from the jerry federal courthouse they didn't use the term that they will be arranged
[2:04:19.260 --> 2:04:25.340]  they said they are going to their detention hearing they specifically called it a detention hearing
[2:04:25.340 --> 2:04:29.660]  which is probably not nothing more preparation for us to get used to that kind of terminology
[2:04:29.660 --> 2:04:34.780]  i would imagine from what i can see what they're trying to do oh they've got the belligerent act
[2:04:35.340 --> 2:04:42.060]  racing through the house and senate where us citizens can be grabbed for any intelligence
[2:04:42.060 --> 2:04:47.900]  purposes and never be seen again an enhanced interrogation can be used again this is they
[2:04:47.900 --> 2:04:53.340]  sold the american people that the police state was for al qaeda now you're gonna learn no it's

[2:08:39.820 --> 2:08:45.900]  walking talking billboard people say berry sataro yeah that's his real name don't believe me just
[2:08:45.900 --> 2:08:52.220]  go google it and you'll see mainstream news london telegraph associated press what they would
[2:08:52.220 --> 2:08:57.660]  deny this during the campaign he is actually a indonesian citizen gave up his u.s citizenship
[2:08:57.660 --> 2:09:02.380]  was adopted that means he's ineligible to be president obviously he's born in kenya the
[2:09:02.380 --> 2:09:07.180]  evidence is overwhelming but you can a hundred percent prove that you can a hundred percent
[2:09:07.180 --> 2:09:13.180]  prove federal law that you cannot have a dual citizenship with indonesia at the time he did
[2:09:13.180 --> 2:09:19.100]  that he is not eligible to be president of the united states and he's it's illegal to be passing
[2:09:19.100 --> 2:09:27.900]  the government takeover of health care it's illegal to be expanding the patriot act all of this to
[2:09:27.900 --> 2:09:36.220]  hire nothing but lobbyist but if you can get al capone on insurance or or tax evasion why
[2:09:36.220 --> 2:09:42.380]  not get this al capone for the fact that he's really berry sataro and everybody needs to get
[2:09:42.380 --> 2:09:47.980]  this shirt and wear it at the tea party events it'll be very very popular let me tell you
[2:09:49.900 --> 2:09:53.020]  all right i'm gonna stop here in just a moment um
[2:09:55.660 --> 2:10:00.700]  we may have a time zone issue with peter dale scott but it's not a big deal
[2:10:02.620 --> 2:10:05.820]  we'll get him on the next few days or he probably thinks he's on next hour
[2:10:05.820 --> 2:10:09.980]  webster tarpley's on i want to get him on about this militia situation i have no idea what his
[2:10:09.980 --> 2:10:14.220]  opinion is i just respect his opinion doesn't mean i'll totally agree with what he has to say
[2:10:14.220 --> 2:10:17.900]  i don't know what he's gonna say because i'm the real expert on this subject i mean i've really
[2:10:17.900 --> 2:10:24.220]  have studied it and been in the middle of it for 14 years but he'll probably see it as a
[2:10:24.220 --> 2:10:30.140]  provocateur and false flag event because i know he'll see some of the same indicators i've seen
[2:10:30.140 --> 2:10:35.420]  i want to get his take on the moscow situation i mean paul watson wrote an article saying well
[2:10:35.420 --> 2:10:42.060]  fsbs been tied to staging events attacks against themselves before this could be russia tarpley
[2:10:42.060 --> 2:10:47.020]  may have a different view i don't know but dr tarpley we always enjoy his analysis
[2:10:47.740 --> 2:10:52.700]  and so uh we'll get his uh take on that uh coming up but right now let's continue with your phone
[2:10:52.700 --> 2:10:59.020]  calls uh let's talk to chris in jersey you're on the air chris gone out i was gone out on
[2:10:59.020 --> 2:11:03.900]  my first time caller i've been listening to you since uh back in 2000 when i was stationed at
[2:11:03.900 --> 2:11:10.060]  port of texas uh i used to listen to you on shortwave and uh i used to like uh listen to you
[2:11:10.060 --> 2:11:14.380]  whenever i was in an active duty military stationed over there and now i live in jersey on school
[2:11:14.380 --> 2:11:19.900]  teacher i'm a military veteran uh it's an honor to talk to you alec well it's an honor to talk to
[2:11:19.900 --> 2:11:24.300]  you let me ask you this question let me ask this question well make your point then i want to ask
[2:11:24.300 --> 2:11:29.900]  you if you've been a long time listener i mean have we not i'm not bragging i want people to
[2:11:29.900 --> 2:11:35.020]  take this serious what we're doing here have we not called everything as it happens before it happens
[2:11:36.220 --> 2:11:41.260]  oh for sure and again here's my point there's no doubt that you are on the money with your analysis
[2:11:41.260 --> 2:11:46.300]  because you know exactly what they're doing and and you are not full of you know what you you
[2:11:46.300 --> 2:11:50.620]  you are precise here's my point you know that cnn call you just did with your producer they're
[2:11:50.620 --> 2:11:55.740]  doing a piece on you so i guarantee you that that they recorded that phone call and they're
[2:11:55.740 --> 2:12:00.780]  going to be using clips of that phone call that you made because the whole point is to kind of
[2:12:00.780 --> 2:12:05.820]  like um denounce you or to or to make you look irrational or irrelevant so i guarantee that
[2:12:05.820 --> 2:12:10.300]  phone call that you use is also going to appear on the piece so it's going to be almost impossible
[2:12:10.300 --> 2:12:15.660]  for anybody to then deny that you stage that uh in a piece whenever they also use your phone
[2:12:15.660 --> 2:12:19.180]  call that you did on air today but just be aware of that out that they're definitely going to be
[2:12:19.180 --> 2:12:23.660]  using that phone call i'd watch out for that and here's the part you know i thought about that while
[2:12:23.660 --> 2:12:28.860]  it was happening but i mean that's okay it's more important in case they don't air it that people
[2:12:28.860 --> 2:12:34.540]  i mean i but then people won't even care they'll say that isn't a real phone call it's like they
[2:12:34.540 --> 2:12:39.100]  say genesis is owned by some saudi arabian anybody could go look at the corporate documents of
[2:12:39.100 --> 2:12:44.300]  genesis communications in minnesota it's owned by ted anderson but they don't care they just make stuff
[2:12:44.300 --> 2:12:51.020]  up and so i probably shouldn't even have responded but i thought it was fun and in its informative
[2:12:51.020 --> 2:12:57.100]  radio to call up and you know talk to the cnn people my my degree in psychology and just my
[2:12:57.100 --> 2:13:01.260]  quick analysis there is i think you put too much credibility into what people that don't believe
[2:13:01.260 --> 2:13:05.580]  you say don't worry about what what what they're saying and them denouncing you and you having
[2:13:05.580 --> 2:13:09.420]  to prove yourself to them you know that you're in the right you know that you're strong stop wasting
[2:13:09.420 --> 2:13:14.540]  your energy and your time on these uh nutty people conspiracy theorists which leads me to my last
[2:13:14.540 --> 2:13:19.660]  point that language has the parameters of our subconscious ego they have already defined the
[2:13:19.660 --> 2:13:26.620]  words terrorist conspiracy theory and words like that they already got those terms i think that we
[2:13:26.620 --> 2:13:32.700]  need a new term and this is a million dollar term alex and i know you kind of struggle to define
[2:13:32.700 --> 2:13:37.180]  yourself when they ask you you kind of am a constitutional conservative libertarian but i
[2:13:37.180 --> 2:13:44.140]  think that the term that we need to start using is truth patriot how can you not be for the truth
[2:13:44.140 --> 2:13:50.860]  and it also kind of plays off on the fact that uh mainstream media spins things and they they sell
[2:13:50.860 --> 2:13:56.620]  us on this info so to be the truth patriot also highlights what the mainstream media is doing
[2:13:56.620 --> 2:14:01.180]  the opposite of and also brings to the fact that they divide and conquer us that we're patriotic
[2:14:01.180 --> 2:14:06.220]  to the truth not to one party we know about the left right paradigm that we are truth
[2:14:07.260 --> 2:14:12.300]  are truthful or patriotic to the truth what do you think about well i've made a i mean i've made
[2:14:12.300 --> 2:14:18.940]  a similar point many times that i'm a freedom lover and i'm into the truth and i don't sit here
[2:14:18.940 --> 2:14:28.700]  and look at a news article and say how should i cover this what will people like i just tell
[2:14:28.700 --> 2:14:35.180]  the truth i just break down my knowledge the research i've done my larger understanding
[2:14:35.180 --> 2:14:42.700]  in context with whatever legislation we're covering or whatever news event we're covering and that's
[2:14:42.700 --> 2:14:52.540]  all i've got is the fact that i am someone who has integrity and so go ahead jfk piece you know
[2:14:52.540 --> 2:14:56.140]  i've been doing a lot of investigation into jfk and i think that's really a turning point where
[2:14:56.140 --> 2:15:01.180]  the new world order made their run for america so you know i wanted to get an update on that from
[2:15:01.180 --> 2:15:07.740]  you and finally the last thing i have for you is uh 9 11 is a powerful number 9 11 is the number
[2:15:07.740 --> 2:15:12.940]  that we call because uh we need help a number we call for safety because we can't provide safety
[2:15:12.940 --> 2:15:19.500]  for ourselves it's an sos call it's an sos call and it has double meaning the government saying
[2:15:19.500 --> 2:15:25.100]  this is our number we did this but but it's hidden in plain view but but but for the weak
[2:15:25.100 --> 2:15:31.340]  minded it's oh 9 11 you call us this is when the government takes over and they were they were on tv
[2:15:31.340 --> 2:15:36.140]  within minutes of the attack saying the world has changed we're going to take your rights away
[2:15:36.140 --> 2:15:42.780]  this is the new world order it was all scripted go ahead and i said in 1991 uh george bush mentions
[2:15:42.780 --> 2:15:48.700]  new world or 2001 9 9 11 the attack happened so just beware of they like the number 9 11
[2:15:48.700 --> 2:15:54.620]  and 10 year increments so you know we're coming up to 2011 i'd watch out for 9 11 2011 you know
[2:15:54.620 --> 2:15:59.420]  i'm just saying that that's their pattern and i picked up on that pattern and they used the
[2:15:59.420 --> 2:16:04.300]  the term 9 11 but you know just to leave you on this note alex don't put so much energy
[2:16:04.300 --> 2:16:07.740]  into the people that are denouncing you and don't have to prove yourself to them
[2:16:07.740 --> 2:16:12.380]  you know you're you're strong you know you're that you're telling the truth and stick with that alex
[2:16:12.380 --> 2:16:16.300]  i've been listening for for 10 years and you're wasting too much energy these people are holding
[2:16:16.300 --> 2:16:21.820]  you down you need to step it up and you need to keep strong and and you are the man i do not
[2:16:21.820 --> 2:16:26.620]  listen to these people trying to denounce you on and don't lower yourself to their level
[2:16:26.620 --> 2:16:31.820]  you are the truth patriot all right i will god bless you chris and and and and so are all our
[2:16:31.820 --> 2:16:37.340]  great listeners that are out there taking action i don't spend much time i don't even spend much
[2:16:37.340 --> 2:16:45.100]  time paying attention to people that are attacking me and lying about me um but if
[2:16:45.100 --> 2:16:50.620]  this is the thought process that went into calling seeing an in back on air
[2:16:53.020 --> 2:16:59.660]  they interview me friday they say it's airing that night it doesn't air and so i'm
[2:17:00.940 --> 2:17:08.220]  out there during a break and i think you know i ought to call them but then i go oh that's
[2:17:08.220 --> 2:17:11.980]  not much time to talk during a break i'll you know to find out if it's ever going to air
[2:17:11.980 --> 2:17:17.260]  why don't i just do it on air and then i think yeah i'm definitely going to do that
[2:17:17.260 --> 2:17:21.580]  because it'll be funny for all the people that are saying i i made up that i was interviewed by
[2:17:21.580 --> 2:17:28.300]  cnn so that's the thought process that went into it but i think it's important sometimes to cover
[2:17:28.300 --> 2:17:35.660]  co until pro and how people try to pull real leaders down because when i'm being attacked
[2:17:35.660 --> 2:17:40.220]  they're not attacking alex jones to get at alex jones they know i'm not going to stop they know
[2:17:40.220 --> 2:17:47.100]  my psychological makeup they are doing that so new people that we've woken up that you've woken up
[2:17:47.820 --> 2:17:54.780]  start investigating and just see all the crud and all the disinformation and all the propaganda and
[2:17:54.780 --> 2:18:07.740]  then just get disillusioned and so but it is a distraction i mean i when callers call in
[2:18:07.740 --> 2:18:14.700]  you know here and bring up alex i know you're a good guy or or you need to answer this question
[2:18:16.620 --> 2:18:23.660]  that's all a distraction at the end of the day because i'm not running the government i'm not
[2:18:23.660 --> 2:18:28.860]  running the country regardless whether i'm a good guy or a bad guy i'm a good guy it's a distraction

[2:25:09.900 --> 2:25:14.460]  this is his wireless card or not he's saying he's being set up and why would he go post threats
[2:25:14.460 --> 2:25:21.900]  and then put his address and name and where he is on info wars dot com and this happened over the
[2:25:21.900 --> 2:25:30.460]  weekend and you read this fox news piece it basically implies it's all my fault and here's
[2:25:30.460 --> 2:25:40.220]  another one the hutari militia michigan militia lone wolves and alex jones new world order

[2:25:52.860 --> 2:25:57.340]  just full swing and they just go picking through this stuff finding anything they can
[2:25:57.340 --> 2:26:02.940]  and to then imply and again that's the talking point from the adl and southern barbie law center
[2:26:02.940 --> 2:26:09.500]  for a year now and now there's a special about me right on time on anderson cooper tonight
[2:26:09.500 --> 2:26:13.820]  but you heard the producer saying it probably is going to air they don't know i mean seeing
[2:26:13.820 --> 2:26:23.980]  it in is making specials about alex jones and i'll tell you we are as clean as a whistle around
[2:26:23.980 --> 2:26:29.580]  here but these people don't care they already tried to set my cameraman up as terrorist
[2:26:31.260 --> 2:26:36.060]  last year in pittsburgh for just walking up saying hi can we talk to your spokesperson
[2:26:36.060 --> 2:26:41.820]  please about the troops on the streets yeah go over there and wait and they get a car pulls up
[2:26:41.820 --> 2:26:47.420]  they say leave and the car follows them and the police come and say they're terrorist
[2:26:47.420 --> 2:26:55.580]  the base says you ran you were sneaking around the fence uh the military husband probe for
[2:26:55.580 --> 2:27:01.740]  allegedly posting threats on radical website fox news and why are they coming after me trying
[2:27:01.740 --> 2:27:05.260]  to discredit me right now because they know that i know they're getting ready to stage a bunch of
[2:27:05.260 --> 2:27:10.860]  terror attacks to be to be blamed on the tea party and all you tea party people you better get ready
[2:27:10.860 --> 2:27:15.420]  for this and when it happens you better come out and explain its false flag i know michael savage
[2:27:15.420 --> 2:27:19.900]  understands it that's why for almost a year i've been playing his prediction that dovetails with
[2:27:19.900 --> 2:27:25.900]  mine in fact cue that back up for the next segment the husband of a military service woman living
[2:27:25.900 --> 2:27:30.620]  on a tennessee naval base is under investigation for posting threatening comments on a radical
[2:27:30.620 --> 2:27:35.580]  right wing website foxnews.com has learned the husband of a military service woman living
[2:27:35.580 --> 2:27:39.340]  in a tennessee naval base is under investigation for posting threatening comments on a radical
[2:27:39.340 --> 2:27:45.900]  right wing website foxnews.com has learned investigators with the naval criminal investigative
[2:27:45.900 --> 2:27:51.260]  services have seized the man's shotgun and taken into the armory at the naval support activity
[2:27:51.260 --> 2:27:56.780]  mid-south based in middleton tennessee the farm will be stored there while the agency's probe
[2:27:58.060 --> 2:28:03.660]  continues well he's saying he didn't do this and who would go say their name and their address
[2:28:03.660 --> 2:28:08.460]  looks like a frame up on the surface doesn't it
[2:28:11.740 --> 2:28:14.460]  the man and then now the article just says he's guilty
[2:28:16.140 --> 2:28:19.180]  he's denying it they don't say that here and then they just say he did it
[2:28:19.820 --> 2:28:25.900]  this is the new journalism the man writing under the name aca posted a comment last week in
[2:28:25.900 --> 2:28:31.100]  response to a story on the expanding role of irs under the new healthcare law the story was posted
[2:28:31.100 --> 2:28:39.420]  on info wars dot com so that implies for the week minded that i posted his story not that it's a
[2:28:39.420 --> 2:28:44.540]  comment which is operated by conservative talk show host alex jones not constitutionalist not
[2:28:44.540 --> 2:28:50.380]  truth teller when i was bashing bush i was a commie now i'm bashing obama i'm a right winger no i'm
[2:28:50.380 --> 2:28:56.380]  a truth teller we just tell the truth in response to comments made by a poster who questioned others
[2:28:56.380 --> 2:29:03.500]  comments to and commitment to violence against government workers aca wrote then i will i hear
[2:29:03.500 --> 2:29:08.940]  by threatening you with violence they even use the legalese to get somebody in trouble that's the
[2:29:08.940 --> 2:29:17.900]  benchmark so he says i declare that i will i have by their end threatened you with violence
[2:29:17.900 --> 2:29:23.660]  if you come to my door address removed because that was in the post see if i'm joking and as for

[2:34:04.700 --> 2:34:11.260]  that so all they ever try to do is to make us feel powerless to make us feel pathetic but it
[2:34:11.260 --> 2:34:16.140]  doesn't work because the people are finding their power they're finding their strength they're rising

[2:35:01.660 --> 2:35:06.860]  body scanners brain scanners and mobile trucks they're just training you that police stick needles in
[2:35:06.860 --> 2:35:13.180]  you this is hardcore scientific tyranny i want to tell you about a few sponsors that have made
[2:35:13.180 --> 2:35:21.260]  today's radio show possible and then we will uh get back into this fox news report and then your
[2:35:21.260 --> 2:35:27.020]  phone calls i mean it's every 30 minutes or something there's some new mainstream article
[2:35:27.020 --> 2:35:36.620]  attacking me and tying me into violent people this is this is getting insane here oh the weird
[2:35:36.620 --> 2:35:40.780]  thing is i'm so relaxed i'm usually all fired up and angry and everything and i'm just like
[2:35:40.780 --> 2:35:47.180]  like very calm i guess because i know what's gonna happen
[2:35:52.940 --> 2:35:57.180]  it's like i'm outside of it more and more i like get outside of things
[2:36:02.620 --> 2:36:08.780]  speaking of michael savage he's on screen right now let's go ahead and play a clip of michael savage
[2:36:08.780 --> 2:36:14.620]  here uh this was almost a year ago he made this prediction here it is another prediction i predict
[2:36:14.620 --> 2:36:21.900]  that very soon obama will create a crisis along the lines of the right stock right stock fire i
[2:36:21.900 --> 2:36:26.380]  don't know what form it will take but i believe that once the minions are seen for what they are
[2:36:27.100 --> 2:36:32.460]  rama manuel and his gang will set off a right stock fire in this country of some kind and they
[2:36:32.460 --> 2:36:37.340]  will recall the military dictatorship of lincoln and stanton during the civil war when civil
[2:36:37.340 --> 2:36:42.380]  civilian suspects were arrested without warrant i will tell you as i sit here i fear that every
[2:36:42.380 --> 2:36:47.980]  night as i go to sleep i put nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized control of
[2:36:47.980 --> 2:36:53.260]  the most powerful economy and the most powerful military on earth know my friends i am losing
[2:36:53.260 --> 2:36:58.700]  a great deal of sleep every night because i do see this happening right before my eyes again i
[2:36:58.700 --> 2:37:03.900]  will repeat what i just said mark it down i again tell you that there will be the equivalent of a
[2:37:03.900 --> 2:37:08.620]  crisis on the order of the right stock fire i don't know where it will occur i don't know how it will
[2:37:08.620 --> 2:37:15.420]  occur i don't know what form it will take but during this crisis that will be triggered by the democrats
[2:37:15.420 --> 2:37:23.100]  around obama the gang that surrounds obama they will bring up lincoln they will recall the military
[2:37:23.100 --> 2:37:29.340]  dictatorship of lincoln in uh in other terms during the civil war and they will do what lincoln did
[2:37:29.340 --> 2:37:34.620]  and they will arrest civilians without warrant in the name of saving the economy or saving the
[2:37:34.620 --> 2:37:39.900]  government from a right-wing takeover mark my words all right you could put that down and now
[2:37:41.180 --> 2:37:46.380]  they have the legislation introduced to do just that we've been covering the last few weeks the
[2:37:46.380 --> 2:37:51.580]  reason i play that clip every few weeks here is because he understands the model of the federal
[2:37:51.580 --> 2:37:57.580]  takeover he understands what they've been positioning for what they've been setting up the
[2:37:57.580 --> 2:38:04.380]  centers to be detained as enemy belligerents paul joseph watson you can go read the bill you can
[2:38:04.380 --> 2:38:10.540]  also read atlantic monthly we have a link to atlantic monthly's articles saying exactly what we had
[2:38:10.540 --> 2:38:16.140]  to say about it this is not just chris and plenna dot com saying this it's not just judge andrew
[2:38:16.140 --> 2:38:21.740]  nipolitano les fratty this says for any intelligence purpose or any such matters as the president
[2:38:21.740 --> 2:38:27.420]  considers appropriate the military can secretly arrest you use enhanced detention and interrogation
[2:38:27.420 --> 2:38:32.620]  that means torture in the enemy belligerent interrogation detention and prosecution act of
[2:38:32.620 --> 2:38:40.380]  2010 and they're going to have all these stage militia bust and more attacks on irs buildings
[2:38:40.380 --> 2:38:46.780]  just building up the next few months more and more and congressman getting shot at or shot and
[2:38:46.780 --> 2:38:57.980]  schools being attacked and bombings look in greece how a woman and a child got bombed or people in
[2:38:57.980 --> 2:39:03.260]  a moscow tube it's it's always the citizens being attacked because the government are the terrorist
[2:39:09.980 --> 2:39:15.260]  and this bill says that no one no court no one will even ever have to know you've been
[2:39:15.260 --> 2:39:18.620]  secretly arrested unless an act of congress is passed
[2:39:26.140 --> 2:39:32.140]  so yes they're really considering everything they've been building towards the last 20 years
[2:39:32.140 --> 2:39:38.220]  in this nation big and and what is on the horizon what's now right down the street
[2:39:38.220 --> 2:39:43.420]  what's just a few feet away from us it's getting closer taking all the pension funds devaluing
[2:39:43.420 --> 2:39:46.940]  the currency bank holidays all being announced mainstream news now
[2:39:50.700 --> 2:39:56.300]  they're demonizing the real militia by promoting cartoon type militias
[2:39:58.940 --> 2:40:02.780]  separately all over the country they are recruiting through the sheriffs
[2:40:04.060 --> 2:40:09.820]  federal minion locals with 50 cows and armored vehicles so that so they're the government is
[2:40:09.820 --> 2:40:15.740]  going on and getting its own counterfeit of the militia an evil militia to quote take on
[2:40:15.740 --> 2:40:22.860]  protesters with 50 caliber rifles just to shoot you what curt nemo wrote about that a month ago
[2:40:23.900 --> 2:40:28.540]  in fact i don't remember the headline we call curt he linked to several mainstream newspapers
[2:40:28.540 --> 2:40:33.420]  and tv stations in louisiana and i i've seen it some other states where it said oh they're
[2:40:33.420 --> 2:40:41.900]  training with 50 caliber to mow down protesters so oh i mean the british in 1776 they have their
[2:40:41.900 --> 2:40:50.220]  counterfeit militia their counterfeit the more things change the more they stay the same
[2:40:50.220 --> 2:40:56.540]  and this is so real what's happening this is a criminal revolution by offshore banks taking
[2:40:56.540 --> 2:41:04.620]  over the country and looting and robbing and raising taxes and sucking the money out of everybody

[2:44:49.420 --> 2:44:53.100]  of the military you want to think more of people in government you want to think more of the people
[2:44:53.100 --> 2:44:58.380]  at cnn you want to think more of the people at fox but they enjoy it they feel like they're part of
[2:44:58.380 --> 2:45:04.140]  a winning team and they're the big glitzy media and the government they can set up and destroy
[2:45:04.140 --> 2:45:11.260]  whoever they want they're just evil evil is being selfish and not caring who you hurt
[2:45:11.260 --> 2:45:18.540]  hurt and enjoying manipulating people enjoying lying to people
[2:45:24.700 --> 2:45:25.500]  i for one
[2:45:31.260 --> 2:45:32.540]  want it to just stop
[2:45:32.540 --> 2:45:43.100]  stop tyranny isn't cute it's not fun it's not cool and all of you fools that have joined up
[2:45:43.100 --> 2:45:50.140]  for this thing you have no idea what your controllers have in store for you or what
[2:45:50.140 --> 2:45:52.300]  the controllers are already doing to us
[2:45:56.300 --> 2:46:00.780]  they really do poison the water supply they really do genetically engineer the crops to
[2:46:00.780 --> 2:46:04.700]  give you cancer they really do put cancer viruses and all the major vaccines i mean
[2:46:04.700 --> 2:46:08.700]  i was going through news from last week here and i was reading all these articles about
[2:46:08.700 --> 2:46:14.940]  cancer viruses and pig cancer viruses and the shots for the kids and it was mainstream news
[2:46:17.020 --> 2:46:21.900]  who comes up with this stuff why why and i'm bad because i don't
[2:46:21.900 --> 2:46:29.660]  know it's the weight
[2:46:34.380 --> 2:46:35.260]  of the knowledge
[2:46:38.300 --> 2:46:41.660]  because i know 99 of people taking part in this
[2:46:41.660 --> 2:46:51.020]  don't understand the big picture and if you did if you knew you would not be part of this
[2:46:58.220 --> 2:46:59.420]  and i can't imagine
[2:47:02.780 --> 2:47:06.860]  but i can imagine and that's the problem but at one level i can't imagine another i can
[2:47:06.860 --> 2:47:11.100]  and the mindset of the controllers they know everything i know and more
[2:47:13.980 --> 2:47:18.300]  the master controllers they see what they're doing they've designed it
[2:47:20.220 --> 2:47:24.220]  and because they know that information they also know humans true potential
[2:47:25.580 --> 2:47:33.420]  and i can't imagine myself being in the mindset of wanting to dumb people down wanting to hurt
[2:47:33.420 --> 2:47:40.220]  people wanting to mutate humanity wanting to be part of all of this
[2:47:48.460 --> 2:47:50.140]  and so what they do is
[2:47:55.660 --> 2:47:59.420]  somebody kills a cop they blame it on me provident person hated me
[2:47:59.420 --> 2:48:03.100]  me or they set up a group and they try to time in with alex jones or
[2:48:04.540 --> 2:48:10.860]  they set up this guy in tennessee and posts his address and name on my comment board on my website
[2:48:10.860 --> 2:48:16.860]  and then try to tie it in in the news calling it a radical website of alex jones
[2:48:21.740 --> 2:48:26.380]  it says both posts have been removed by the site earlier this month of course the cops gave them
[2:48:26.380 --> 2:48:30.620]  this information earlier this month or it was given in the southern property law center or
[2:48:30.620 --> 2:48:36.700]  adl and that was given to fox earlier this month the aca posted a series of comments in which he
[2:48:36.700 --> 2:48:41.420]  talked about killing police officers and other law enforcement officers
[2:48:43.980 --> 2:48:50.300]  and see they never say that this guy is guilty until proven innocent but that's what they're
[2:48:50.300 --> 2:48:54.860]  doing here this is guilty until proven innocent not innocent until proven guilty they're now saying
[2:48:54.860 --> 2:48:59.980]  he's guilty they just say he did it even though they never say he's admitted to doing
[2:49:02.140 --> 2:49:06.060]  and one he claimed to keep an ar-15 assault rifle by his door and loaded 12 gauge shotgun
[2:49:06.060 --> 2:49:12.780]  nearby and he said he'd like to use both to kill police the navel bay spokesman said only one
[2:49:12.780 --> 2:49:20.860]  weapon the shotgun was removed from the man's home aca is also praise the actions of joe stacked
[2:49:20.860 --> 2:49:28.460]  the anti-tax texan who last month crashed a small plane into an austin building that houses the irs
[2:49:28.460 --> 2:49:33.740]  office killing one of the workers aca said in a one online post that stacked didn't have enough
[2:49:33.740 --> 2:49:39.500]  explosives on board the plane another post he implored others to target transportation secretary
[2:49:39.500 --> 2:49:46.940]  administration employees and an earlier post he wrote tsa truly stupid a-holes the guy that lived
[2:49:46.940 --> 2:49:54.700]  next to me worked for them and i made his life a living hell till he moved one monday morning
[2:49:54.700 --> 2:50:01.740]  ncis agents and base security located aca at the address that was yesterday and privately owned
[2:50:01.740 --> 2:50:09.180]  on base housing unit that he posted in a recent comment on info wars dot com he admitted to
[2:50:09.180 --> 2:50:15.820]  posting the comment said base spokesman david krenshaw the man's name was not revealed but
[2:50:15.820 --> 2:50:20.460]  see i've had base security people lie about my employees before so i don't and this guy called
[2:50:20.460 --> 2:50:25.340]  here saying he hadn't done this so i don't know what's true based on the statements the installation
[2:50:25.340 --> 2:50:29.500]  commanding officer requested the resident surrender any weapons the base security for
[2:50:29.500 --> 2:50:34.380]  safekeeping until the investigation could be completed the resident was cooperative and
[2:50:34.380 --> 2:50:38.380]  compliant with the request enable criminal investigative services and the installation
[2:50:38.380 --> 2:50:42.140]  security team are conducting an investigation and the statements determined if there is any

[2:54:41.260 --> 2:54:47.580]  us to mean i had had a chance to read the whole thing yet it's a long article and it says this
[2:54:47.580 --> 2:54:53.580]  action was taken at refoxnews.com inquired about the online comments so there are literally millions
[2:54:53.580 --> 2:54:57.900]  of violent and threatening comments i mean you go to youtube they're just everywhere i'm gonna come
[2:54:57.900 --> 2:55:02.700]  to your house and kill you i'm gonna do this somebody needs to go after obama somebody needs
[2:55:02.700 --> 2:55:11.020]  to do this but cnn fox all of them southern property law center adl they just climb over the site
[2:55:12.700 --> 2:55:19.420]  reporting this to the feds so that they can then have pieces implying i have a radical bad website
[2:55:19.420 --> 2:55:26.700]  i'll guarantee you we can go search databases of fox news and fox nation comment boards and find
[2:55:26.700 --> 2:55:33.100]  stuff it's just insane until you understand they're trying to set us up and create this
[2:55:34.780 --> 2:55:38.860]  idea that alex jones is violent and bad has to be brought down has to be dealt with
[2:55:41.020 --> 2:55:45.020]  even though he's a civilian the man is living on a military base making him a subject of rules on
[2:55:45.020 --> 2:55:49.500]  that base the commanding officer has the authority to take any weapons that are on the base or that
[2:55:49.500 --> 2:55:54.620]  they belong to a member of the military or a civilian and store them at the armory for the
[2:55:54.620 --> 2:55:59.740]  same reason the ncis has the authority to arrest him the man who has not been charged will be permitted
[2:55:59.740 --> 2:56:04.620]  to check his shotgun out of the armory but he will be monitored while doing so krinshaw said
[2:56:04.620 --> 2:56:09.980]  ncis of the base security force will continue to monitor the man as they conduct the investigation
[2:56:09.980 --> 2:56:18.380]  this is even proper english they will continue to monitor the man as they conducts
[2:56:19.980 --> 2:56:26.060]  their investigation thus far krinshaw said it appeared investigators that the man had not
[2:56:26.060 --> 2:56:32.380]  violated any law well that sounds like a setup then threatening violence is taken very seriously
[2:56:32.380 --> 2:56:36.380]  but it's not necessarily legal act there's freedom of speech krinshaw said adding that
[2:56:36.380 --> 2:56:41.260]  investigators would step in if they since the man was going to take action and that his online
[2:56:41.260 --> 2:56:53.500]  rants were more than just blather krinshaw said he did not know who if madman the commenter who
[2:56:53.500 --> 2:57:01.740]  replied to acas post was being sought by investigators well everybody has enjoyed the comment sections
[2:57:01.740 --> 2:57:10.060]  of info wars and prison planet but we've tried to not go to a registration system but we've
[2:57:10.060 --> 2:57:16.060]  got to just now go to a strong registration system but we tried it once and then they just put fake
[2:57:16.060 --> 2:57:25.500]  emails and fake names and fake ip's in to do all this and uh they're trying a lot of other stuff too
[2:57:25.500 --> 2:57:31.660]  they call into the show and say you know basically you're a coward you need to call for violence
[2:57:31.660 --> 2:57:38.460]  alex trying to manipulate me into that i genuinely believe violence is not the answer and i've always
[2:57:38.460 --> 2:57:43.980]  explained that information is the answer the system stages violent acts over and over again
[2:57:44.780 --> 2:57:52.700]  as a pretext to demonize legitimate constitutional debate we're winning in all the polls the people
[2:57:52.700 --> 2:57:57.820]  are really waking up that's why the system is going to stage terror attacks and blame them on
[2:57:57.820 --> 2:58:02.060]  the patriot the conservative the libertarian the second amendment groups the tea parties
[2:58:02.060 --> 2:58:09.340]  and yours truly number one i'm the big enemy i'm not controlled opposition like glenn beck i'm real
[2:58:09.340 --> 2:58:18.940]  the system knows that and we have educated tens of millions of people and we're exponentially
[2:58:18.940 --> 2:58:26.220]  growing and they know that but i should be glad they're just trying to demonize me because that's
[2:58:26.220 --> 2:58:29.580]  probably the extent of it they know if they kill me or set me up that'll be too obvious
[2:58:31.180 --> 2:58:36.940]  but who knows but regardless i know i've done this to wake people up and try to save my beloved

[3:08:05.740 --> 3:08:15.740]  the g-c-n radio network
[3:08:19.260 --> 3:08:25.900]  Webster Griffin Tarpley a doctor of history and economics he features of course every week or
[3:08:25.900 --> 3:08:31.180]  two here on the radio show is one of our analysts he's also in my film fall the republic and the
[3:08:31.180 --> 3:08:37.260]  obama deception and he's done some of the most hardcore in-depth research out there i really
[3:08:37.260 --> 3:08:43.900]  respect his opinion now look i know that russian intelligence services have staged false flag
[3:08:43.900 --> 3:08:49.900]  events before the british do it israelis do it the u.s. does it this is a tool of government
[3:08:51.660 --> 3:08:58.700]  and paul watson wrote an article saying moscow metro blast another fsb inside job
[3:08:58.700 --> 3:09:08.140]  and then watson looks at the fact that 99 police caught fsb planting bombs in a fourth
[3:09:08.140 --> 3:09:12.540]  apartment building three have been blown up now tarpley would say this is some type of
[3:09:12.540 --> 3:09:21.180]  triple double cross false flag by the west and he's got quotes from putin saying similar
[3:09:21.180 --> 3:09:25.580]  things but i look at 99 putin wasn't probably going to win as the vice president of yeltsin
[3:09:25.580 --> 3:09:31.340]  but then saying the chechnians had attacked giving them a pretext as vice president to
[3:09:31.340 --> 3:09:38.460]  lead a popular war but tarpley and i have argued back and forth about this i'm only looking for
[3:09:38.460 --> 3:09:43.180]  the truth and i know that tarpley is looking for the truth on this but i know that the west got
[3:09:43.180 --> 3:09:49.660]  behind putin and medidyev and others and said oh yes clearly you know the al-qaeda groups have
[3:09:49.660 --> 3:09:54.060]  attacked you and now they've got troops in the subways and here in the u.s and england and
[3:09:54.060 --> 3:09:58.220]  they're really hyping this up we also have all these militias getting set up clearly setups
[3:09:58.220 --> 3:10:03.900]  all over the country and mainstream media trying to tie me into it just all over the place cnn
[3:10:03.900 --> 3:10:10.540]  fox uh they're really coming after us right now i want to ask tarpley why we're so much in the
[3:10:10.540 --> 3:10:16.460]  crosshairs clearly this is an attempt to demonize any populist or true constitutionalist movement
[3:10:16.460 --> 3:10:19.340]  in the tea parties and make them fully run by the republicans
[3:10:19.340 --> 3:10:24.540]  and i was talking to tarpley about that during the break he agreed on that front
[3:10:25.100 --> 3:10:30.460]  and i see april to be a big month of staged events you've got the insurance companies taking over
[3:10:30.460 --> 3:10:35.500]  health care we'll get tarpleys take on that uh webster griffin tarpley what do you want to
[3:10:35.500 --> 3:10:40.540]  tackle first the militia information let's go with russia because this gets us the big picture
[3:10:40.540 --> 3:10:49.500]  in the world go um the baska subway bombing so uh with these things going back now decades right
[3:10:49.500 --> 3:10:57.340]  if the the chechen and related caucuses north caucuses terror groups and there there are about
[3:10:57.340 --> 3:11:03.980]  a dozen very small nationalities ethnic groups there called the ethnic labyrinth of the north
[3:11:03.980 --> 3:11:13.820]  caucuses because this chechnya dagestan um the circassians the gabardino balkaria tiny little
[3:11:13.820 --> 3:11:18.940]  entities it's the most diverse area in the world in that sense and it's been a it's been a an area
[3:11:18.940 --> 3:11:24.700]  of conflict for centuries really it was the border between the turkish empire and the russian empire
[3:11:24.700 --> 3:11:31.900]  so the cia and british support for chechen terrorism is just notorious right the leader of the
[3:11:31.900 --> 3:11:39.340]  chechen terrorist was this guy basayev who was trained in a cia camp in afghanistan and uh
[3:11:39.340 --> 3:11:45.260]  this is just well known so uh the the suspect is the suspicion always goes directly to the
[3:11:45.260 --> 3:11:51.340]  us and the british uh putin said back in 2001 that if you want to join the chechen terror
[3:11:51.340 --> 3:11:56.700]  organization you can go to london and there's a place where pretty much openly uh they do
[3:11:56.700 --> 3:12:03.100]  recruiting for that right in the middle of uh londonistan so the question is why now right
[3:12:03.100 --> 3:12:10.380]  there there was this attack last november on the moscow to st petersburg uh expressed right
[3:12:10.380 --> 3:12:16.300]  the the niebsky super train that they have and that killed about 30 people uh now the the russians
[3:12:16.300 --> 3:12:21.740]  have tracked down and killed the person that they say is responsible for that and that that was wrapped
[3:12:21.740 --> 3:12:27.740]  up at the beginning of march about a month ago now so in the meantime though what what's the big picture
[3:12:28.460 --> 3:12:34.940]  remember the goal of the u.s is to split russia from china right to drive a wedge between russia
[3:12:34.940 --> 3:12:41.340]  and china and foment conflict there they're also interested in being friends with russia
[3:12:41.340 --> 3:12:47.820]  we just have this new uh nuclear arms treaty right the so-called star treaty between russia
[3:12:47.820 --> 3:12:52.060]  and the united states nobody really knows the details yet but it's going to be signed soon
[3:12:52.060 --> 3:12:57.900]  and then presumably we'll see it to play russia however against china and against iran in
[3:12:57.900 --> 3:13:02.940]  the words the u.s becomes friends with russia but for a price and the price always is friction with
[3:13:02.940 --> 3:13:08.860]  china friction with iran because the the the ideas to get conflict going in those areas now
[3:13:09.500 --> 3:13:15.180]  the the anger and resentment on the part of the anglo americans against russia would be this
[3:13:15.180 --> 3:13:22.700]  we just had the meeting of putin now the russian prime minister with this guy he his name is it's
[3:13:22.700 --> 3:13:29.660]  written x i is the vice president of china and he's going to become the president of china at
[3:13:29.660 --> 3:13:36.380]  least he's the heir apparent when the chinese party congress meets in the fall of 2012 this guy
[3:13:36.380 --> 3:13:43.020]  he again with x i is going to become the uh the the uh the president if if all goes according to
[3:13:43.020 --> 3:13:48.460]  what is thought so this this idea is already important that putin is cementing a permanent
[3:13:48.460 --> 3:13:53.740]  alliance of russia with china right that's the the elementary thing for anybody in the world
[3:13:53.740 --> 3:14:00.060]  to be able to resist the anglo americans now the other thing is ukraine right ukraine we had this
[3:14:00.060 --> 3:14:06.220]  big color revolution staged by this big new brzezinski nato intelligence and and so forth
[3:14:06.220 --> 3:14:12.140]  and they took over the government with a puppet regime in the fall of 2004 and that puppet regime
[3:14:12.140 --> 3:14:17.980]  is now completely gone the puppet president you shanko is out the puppet prime minister timmo
[3:14:17.980 --> 3:14:23.340]  shanko is out and the guy you have in there now is yanukovic and he's more or less a reasonable
[3:14:23.340 --> 3:14:28.940]  ukrainian right not not a slave of moscow not a slave of nato of the european union but a
[3:14:28.940 --> 3:14:35.660]  ukrainian and that is not enough however for the for the for the nato side the other thing then is
[3:14:35.660 --> 3:14:42.380]  what the russians are doing in iran uh in iran the color revolution there never got off the ground
[3:14:42.380 --> 3:14:47.500]  it seems to have just about disappeared completely well let me stop you for a moment as we continue
[3:14:47.500 --> 3:14:55.020]  to go around the different geopolitical regions here webster this is the issue why and we know
[3:14:55.020 --> 3:15:01.740]  that a lot of the different chetchen and and muslim minority groups in some areas majority groups
[3:15:01.740 --> 3:15:08.060]  in that entire area we know the west has been funding them since during the cold war of course
[3:15:08.060 --> 3:15:15.020]  you you go further east over into afghanistan and those areas they were publicly funded as
[3:15:15.020 --> 3:15:22.380]  mujahideen and these great saviors so we know that's going on but but answer me this why would the
[3:15:22.380 --> 3:15:30.860]  west want to start bombing putin when he is running for the presidency when an elementary
[3:15:30.860 --> 3:15:38.940]  school student who understands this would know that terror attacks against a government official
[3:15:38.940 --> 3:15:45.580]  who can then lead a war against it would would would sweep him to power if the establishment
[3:15:45.580 --> 3:15:51.900]  knew that putin was going to arrest and kick all these anglo-american Rothschild type bankers
[3:15:52.540 --> 3:15:59.020]  out of the country and then fast forwarding after you answer that how does this hurt putin
[3:15:59.020 --> 3:16:06.860]  and mediedev how does that hurt them when this will clearly allow them to crack down expand
[3:16:06.860 --> 3:16:14.300]  operations and and play the part of strong men protecting the russian bears cubs i mean i'm i'm
[3:16:14.300 --> 3:16:19.900]  trying to understand the key bono here who benefits just remember now that there is a strategy of the
[3:16:19.900 --> 3:16:25.340]  u.s in the british which was published in in a somewhat diluted form in the london economist back
[3:16:25.340 --> 3:16:33.900]  in uh august september of 2004 how you split russia in the words break up the whole russian federation
[3:16:33.900 --> 3:16:39.020]  starting from these places in the north caucuses and the south caucuses because you've got uh
[3:16:39.020 --> 3:16:43.100]  georgia there you've got armenia you've got asa parjan but then in the north caucuses you've
[3:16:43.100 --> 3:16:48.380]  got this array of a dozen others and the idea is that if you can get an endless civil war in this
[3:16:48.380 --> 3:16:54.700]  area this can then spread to other smaller units of the russian federation in the words the non-ethnic
[3:16:54.700 --> 3:17:00.700]  russian parts of the russian federation because the russian federation is a big multinational
[3:17:00.700 --> 3:17:05.420]  state right it's got all sorts of different ethnic groups in it so the the idea is always
[3:17:05.420 --> 3:17:10.860]  to use this for for greater splitting now concerning putin putin of course is heavily
[3:17:10.860 --> 3:17:17.180]  identified with the uh with the kgb fsp and the security services so to a significant degree his
[3:17:17.180 --> 3:17:24.940]  reputation depends on effective fighting against these these terrorists right so if you have a big
[3:17:24.940 --> 3:17:31.020]  high-profile uh event like this in a certain way you could say well this makes putin look bad maybe
[3:17:31.020 --> 3:17:36.140]  in the secret councils of the kremlin people come forward and say hey putin you're not doing a very
[3:17:36.140 --> 3:17:42.140]  good job uh and the hope i think is that the anglo-americans once again to drive a wedge in
[3:17:42.140 --> 3:17:49.020]  this case a wedge between putin and medvedev so that putin uh looks bad and medvedev who is a
[3:17:49.020 --> 3:17:55.740]  a relatively untested figure by comparison to putin we don't know really how medvedev responds
[3:17:55.740 --> 3:18:00.940]  to these things to try to to try to split them and foment the conflict at that level so i think
[3:18:00.940 --> 3:18:06.220]  that's that's something real there's also a series of people that are identified with putin
[3:18:06.220 --> 3:18:11.260]  as prime minister the the head of uh you know the head of the the security agency the head of the
[3:18:11.260 --> 3:18:17.420]  rail system and so forth and targeting targeting the putin faction uh and creating trouble this way
[3:18:18.220 --> 3:18:23.500]  just concerning iran the color revolution there is failing and it's failing with russian help
[3:18:23.500 --> 3:18:29.900]  russian help not very specific the russians have started once again building the bushier nuclear
[3:18:29.900 --> 3:18:35.260]  reactor and one of the big goals of the u.s the british and the israelis is to prevent
[3:18:35.260 --> 3:18:41.980]  this bushier nuclear reactor from ever going online finally and this gets us into into europe
[3:18:41.980 --> 3:18:46.460]  you have this south stream pipeline there are two competing pipelines there in the
[3:18:46.460 --> 3:18:51.260]  sort of from the black sea over to southern europe uh one of them is the south stream that's the
[3:18:51.260 --> 3:18:56.620]  russian plan and that has the support of turkey which again london and washington don't like
[3:18:56.620 --> 3:19:03.100]  and above all of italy and that's berlusconi berlusconi is the biggest ally of putin in
[3:19:03.100 --> 3:19:07.740]  western europe and you see what happened to him right he got hit with this heavy uh
[3:19:07.740 --> 3:19:14.940]  super heavy paperweight back in uh in december well berlusconi has just won the italian regional
[3:19:14.940 --> 3:19:20.700]  election so the the huge international campaign against berlusconi has also flopped so if you
[3:19:20.700 --> 3:19:27.100]  look at the anglo-americans they failed in ukraine they're going nowhere with iran their plan for a
[3:19:27.100 --> 3:19:33.900]  color revolution the violet revolution in italy is also going nowhere uh and putin is making
[3:19:33.900 --> 3:19:39.580]  he's building bridges to china and uh and building this pipeline so i think that's sort of a
[3:19:39.580 --> 3:19:45.180]  an area you can see all of the reasons that there's rage in london and washington against
[3:19:45.180 --> 3:19:51.340]  moscow and this attempted bombing of the fsb headquarters from below from the subway let's
[3:19:51.340 --> 3:19:58.140]  talk about where the globalists are going next and then i want to talk about the fact that i am

[3:24:40.620 --> 3:24:45.660]  now we have bloomberg announcing that federal regulators are basically ordering government

[3:24:58.940 --> 3:25:06.460]  definitely getting ready for a full financial controlled implosion and i'm i'm i'm i'm web
[3:25:06.460 --> 3:25:09.740]  sure i want to get into this now that we'll come back and look at the big picture of where they're
[3:25:09.740 --> 3:25:18.860]  going on the world stage but you know i've got all these articles here uh cnn's doing a piece on
[3:25:18.860 --> 3:25:27.100]  me tonight you know am i causing violence am i dangerous uh military husband probe for allegedly
[3:25:27.100 --> 3:25:34.140]  posting threats on radical website fox news info wars dot com it implies it's my fault uh there's
[3:25:34.140 --> 3:25:39.740]  another headline where it says alex jones is causing all this and we've got all sorts of dirty
[3:25:39.740 --> 3:25:45.020]  tricks going on webster that i don't want to get into on air the point is london guardian saying
[3:25:45.020 --> 3:25:49.820]  i'm the center of this anti-government black hole i'm dangerous southern property law center
[3:25:49.820 --> 3:25:54.460]  putting reports out every week they say next month's issue is going to have me in the cover story
[3:25:55.260 --> 3:26:01.020]  uh so so a why do you and i'm not about protecting myself i mean i really want your opinion it's not
[3:26:01.020 --> 3:26:06.460]  like oh look i'm in the media no i mean this is not fun it's like having hitler in 1939 giving
[3:26:06.460 --> 3:26:11.980]  speeches against you and you live in you you live in berlin i mean it's it's it's creepy
[3:26:11.980 --> 3:26:17.420]  but but you've been fighting these people for 40 years uh but but not just the attack on alex
[3:26:17.420 --> 3:26:22.780]  jones clearly these militia raids were set ups i predicted last year with one of the militia
[3:26:22.780 --> 3:26:28.060]  members who was on i said i think you're a fraud i think you're probably a government agent i said
[3:26:28.060 --> 3:26:32.940]  let me guess you guys are training to attack the police station or uh and i said if that's going
[3:26:32.940 --> 3:26:37.900]  on that's the feds because i've seen this over and over again for so many reasons they want to get
[3:26:37.900 --> 3:26:43.660]  the police hating the citizens uh you know they said they want to attack a funeral possession
[3:26:43.660 --> 3:26:48.940]  you know they think of the worst things they can think of and i've had the military and police
[3:26:48.940 --> 3:26:53.900]  try to frame my cameraman in new york and at the g20 when they're just peacefully
[3:26:53.900 --> 3:26:59.580]  nicely trying to interview them webster so the point is why do you think they're coming after
[3:26:59.580 --> 3:27:06.780]  me in particular and how is all this fear mongering about militias i mean we know in 95 the fed
[3:27:06.780 --> 3:27:13.580]  stage the Oklahoma city bombing go ahead well on on broadway they say a knock is a boost meaning
[3:27:13.580 --> 3:27:21.020]  that if you come under attack this indicates that you're effective so uh if we have an attack
[3:27:21.020 --> 3:27:27.500]  from somebody like anderson cooper and as you you pointed out right anderson cooper is this former
[3:27:28.540 --> 3:27:35.900]  cia recruit cia trainee and of course he's a vanderbilt uh he is the poor little rich boy who
[3:27:35.900 --> 3:27:42.460]  was the son of gloria vanderbilt the heiress to this fortune going back into the 19th century so
[3:27:42.460 --> 3:27:47.980]  to say that he is a rich elitist a patrician aristocrat i guess is putting it putting it
[3:27:47.980 --> 3:27:54.860]  mildly and of course these are the resources of of cnn uh back in the 1970s uh this would have
[3:27:54.860 --> 3:27:59.820]  been a part of the picture that people had at the time and it was quite clear that the cia
[3:27:59.820 --> 3:28:06.540]  massively infiltrates the mass media uh and this this is a good example so this is coming from
[3:28:06.540 --> 3:28:13.020]  from the intelligent agent that i guess you can say uh after this last weekend here with the with
[3:28:13.020 --> 3:28:18.860]  the tea party and the and the peace marchers coming to washington there's a huge hysteria
[3:28:18.860 --> 3:28:25.740]  of the uh wall street controlled media and they've decided to take i think really minor incidents
[3:28:25.740 --> 3:28:31.980]  that occurred at the capital and and make that into some kind of uh avalanche of uh of hysteria
[3:28:31.980 --> 3:28:36.860]  well let's talk about that when we come back but specifically why are they choosing me
[3:28:36.860 --> 3:28:43.980]  me more and more it's emerging that i am going to be the chief devil that i'm being put on
[3:28:43.980 --> 3:28:49.980]  display and they keep lying and saying i'm calling for violence which is the opposite are they angry
[3:28:49.980 --> 3:28:54.940]  that i'm that i'm trying to stop violence absolutely and i mean this is this is just

[3:33:06.300 --> 3:33:16.300]  so
[3:33:27.020 --> 3:33:31.580]  we are picking webster tarbleys brain on a host of important issues
[3:33:31.580 --> 3:33:38.220]  and why are they choosing to demonize the tea parties i mean i see the republicans coming
[3:33:38.220 --> 3:33:46.060]  in and setting the parameters of what the tea parties should be in their image pro war pro
[3:33:46.060 --> 3:33:52.220]  patriot act torture police state and the republicans well they might save us in a few years if we
[3:33:52.220 --> 3:33:58.940]  vote them into power that way the power structure stays intact meanwhile they then could split off
[3:33:58.940 --> 3:34:05.100]  any of the radicals as they see them and demonize them set them up arrest them uh why do you see
[3:34:05.100 --> 3:34:12.060]  them going after me just to demonize my name or is this a preparatory phase uh before some type
[3:34:12.060 --> 3:34:17.820]  of setup webster i would say it has to do with the crisis in the political system after the
[3:34:17.820 --> 3:34:25.820]  passage of this uh obama care um it's because you are one of the leading public figures who
[3:34:25.820 --> 3:34:34.300]  is able to escape this rigid ideological dichotomy the so-called left right uh split uh that is to
[3:34:34.300 --> 3:34:40.380]  say there's a there's a convergence of elements that are considered conservative with elements
[3:34:40.380 --> 3:34:46.700]  that are left wing that could become the basis for challenging the democratic and republican
[3:34:46.700 --> 3:34:51.260]  parties and i let me stop you let me stop i totally agree it's because i go on the air
[3:34:51.260 --> 3:34:56.780]  here on other big national shows in my own and point out that the insurance companies wrote
[3:34:56.780 --> 3:35:01.900]  the bill something that howard dean deniz casinage told the truth about months ago before being taken
[3:35:01.900 --> 3:35:06.700]  up on the mountain and selling out because when you go to the left and go wait a minute this cuts
[3:35:06.700 --> 3:35:13.020]  medicare medicaid raises your tax taxes lowers the standards of care this doesn't have your public
[3:35:13.020 --> 3:35:17.980]  option now the left wakes up and you show the right wing that i've noticed limbaugh and others
[3:35:17.980 --> 3:35:23.580]  always say the insurance companies are good they were against this so it shatters that deception
[3:35:23.580 --> 3:35:28.540]  and brings the people together in a populist movement against the bankers and i continue to call
[3:35:28.540 --> 3:35:34.540]  for going after the banking structure not going after just puppets like obama exactly and and i
[3:35:34.540 --> 3:35:39.740]  think they did there's a sense that the time for this may be right uh if you look at the response
[3:35:39.740 --> 3:35:46.060]  in the left wing of the uh democratic party so to speak uh to this uh betrayal on the health care
[3:35:46.060 --> 3:35:51.660]  um you see that uh you know congressman kucinage folded he voted for it the progressive caucus
[3:35:51.660 --> 3:35:57.180]  they all voted for uh for obama of course they were all terrorized by by rama manual and that
[3:35:57.180 --> 3:36:02.220]  machine operating out of the white house if you look though at this blog called fire dog lake
[3:36:02.220 --> 3:36:08.060]  written by jane hampshire who was uh i guess i'm somewhat reluctant supporter of obama back in
[3:36:08.060 --> 3:36:14.060]  in 2008 she comes on saying that if you look at the obama health plan it is close to the
[3:36:14.060 --> 3:36:20.860]  dictionary definition of fascism in other words the fascist corporate state now i think on that basis
[3:36:20.860 --> 3:36:27.660]  you could say the time may be ripe for a convergence of political forces outside the democratic and
[3:36:27.660 --> 3:36:35.660]  republican parties that would be anti-war anti-dictatorship anti-wall street anti-federal
[3:36:35.660 --> 3:36:41.580]  reserve and i think that's that's a convergence that is now possible i would just say that would
[3:36:41.580 --> 3:36:47.820]  then have to become not just anti but also in favor of something and specifically this
[3:36:47.820 --> 3:36:54.060]  we're now in a world economic depression if we look back to the 1930s in the most general terms
[3:36:54.060 --> 3:37:00.300]  we went from depression to dictatorship in germany especially but also elsewhere and then we had a
[3:37:00.300 --> 3:37:07.100]  world war so what we've got to do is to prevent this depression from going on and on and turning
[3:37:07.100 --> 3:37:12.860]  into a dictatorship because i would always argue that the the motion in favor of totalitarian and
[3:37:12.860 --> 3:37:18.460]  authoritarian police state measures is always coming ultimately from the fact that the economy
[3:37:18.460 --> 3:37:23.020]  is collapsing and the ruling elite is trying to respond to this and clearly they've been setting
[3:37:23.020 --> 3:37:27.660]  up for this for decades this is premeditated but that's the next issue and we'll talk about some
[3:37:27.660 --> 3:37:33.740]  solutions web sir i know you have your opinion on those my question here for you though is
[3:37:33.740 --> 3:37:39.340]  the system is ignoring any reforms that would actually fix the country and then there wouldn't
[3:37:39.340 --> 3:37:45.420]  be a need for a dictatorship from their view but they want this austerity the federal reserve heads
[3:37:45.420 --> 3:37:51.020]  are out pushing it they want to make us poppers so we're more easily managed they they brag about it
[3:37:51.020 --> 3:37:56.620]  they talk about it their whole eugenics you know fake environmental movement and and that's in big
[3:37:56.620 --> 3:38:02.620]  trouble and so i think this this this acceleration of authoritarian systems that were already growing
[3:38:02.620 --> 3:38:08.140]  and in place is an act of desperation clearly that's happening all the poll numbers on every issue
[3:38:08.140 --> 3:38:14.220]  show that in this dictatorship of these plutocrats is now coming out but the system doesn't care and
[3:38:14.220 --> 3:38:19.980]  i see trial balloons in the wall street journal in bloomberg in world net daily they're admitting
[3:38:19.980 --> 3:38:24.060]  okay the regulators that have control over these pension funds with federal power
[3:38:24.060 --> 3:38:29.020]  they're saying invest in bad banks they're not saying invest in some great government program
[3:38:29.020 --> 3:38:36.300]  they're saying you will prop up the banks and and so where do you see that going well the people
[3:38:36.300 --> 3:38:40.860]  who are told to do this have to say no and above all the people that are stakeholders meaning
[3:38:40.860 --> 3:38:46.300]  the people whose money is involved have got to say no i would say the single most important
[3:38:46.300 --> 3:38:51.420]  question right now is the anti-wall street because i think that's the the universal common
[3:38:51.420 --> 3:38:57.340]  denominator that just about everybody can share and there's no political force that embodies this
[3:38:57.340 --> 3:39:03.020]  there's nobody willing to take it on i went to see the tea party here at capitol hill uh ten days
[3:39:03.020 --> 3:39:08.460]  ago and what you find is that the tea party i think has been purged uh what you find there are
[3:39:08.460 --> 3:39:13.420]  people who are quite frankly republicans they sit there they listen to republican members of the
[3:39:13.420 --> 3:39:19.580]  congress and republican operatives and republican think tankers from you know all different republican
[3:39:19.580 --> 3:39:24.620]  lobbying institutions and and whatever and then when you talk to the to the people in the tea
[3:39:24.620 --> 3:39:30.380]  parties it's actually funny a lot of them are retired military and most of them have a government
[3:39:30.380 --> 3:39:36.460]  pension and they have either veterans trycare or they have veterans administrations pensions
[3:39:36.460 --> 3:39:41.100]  and you get the idea that they're they're saying i have my piece of the federal budget i don't want
[3:39:41.100 --> 3:39:46.780]  anybody else to to get a to get a piece for themselves at my expense so the the thing is
[3:39:46.780 --> 3:39:52.780]  that uh palin said the republican party ought to absorb the tea party well that's that's what
[3:39:52.780 --> 3:39:58.700]  they're trying to do i would not say that the tea party is only demonized they're also given huge
[3:39:58.700 --> 3:40:05.580]  huge publicity because i think the yeah but that's double edge because because then then they appoint
[3:40:05.580 --> 3:40:14.380]  the republican eyes republicanoid tea party they they take it over but then separately in the left
[3:40:14.380 --> 3:40:20.140]  right paradigm they then also make it the polar opposite so it's the savior to some the devil
[3:40:20.140 --> 3:40:24.940]  to others but again it's it's within a controlled system absolutely controlled and remember i think
[3:40:24.940 --> 3:40:30.780]  the big the big problem on the horizon is this general petraeus and mit romney general petraeus
[3:40:30.780 --> 3:40:35.420]  for president if general petraeus comes out for president you'll immediately get what's left of
[3:40:35.420 --> 3:40:40.620]  the tea party which again are mostly retired military this was the overwhelming majority
[3:40:40.620 --> 3:40:48.140]  of the group and then romney with his best-selling book uh and his uh ideas about austerity uh
[3:40:48.140 --> 3:40:55.340]  romney is now intervening in the senatorial race in utah supporting uh bennett who's under fire
[3:40:55.340 --> 3:41:00.780]  right the republican senator and saying bennett voted for the bailout the bailout was a good
[3:41:00.780 --> 3:41:06.220]  thing we had to give the money to the banks support bennett because he stood by the banks
[3:41:06.220 --> 3:41:11.340]  when the going got tough so you get the idea this would become a wall street dictatorship
[3:41:11.340 --> 3:41:15.660]  well that's why we see the republicans going after uh rand paul in kentucky who looks like
[3:41:15.660 --> 3:41:21.420]  he's going to win letting the head of elections run as a for senate and run his own election
[3:41:22.380 --> 3:41:29.020]  i mean just just unprecedented and you've got palan supporting john mccain who was pro bailout
[3:41:29.020 --> 3:41:34.700]  so clearly i guess that's why i'm being targeted because i don't want the banks to fully
[3:41:35.500 --> 3:41:41.660]  sucked this country dry yes and certainly a palan of course was pro bailout herself
[3:41:41.660 --> 3:41:48.060]  she was directly uh involved so i think that the the the position that you occupy in this
[3:41:48.060 --> 3:41:54.860]  in the spectrum is you defy this uh splitting like the the wedge issues essentially because
[3:41:54.860 --> 3:42:00.780]  that's what they are you're above the wedge issues and you're offering a critique of this
[3:42:00.780 --> 3:42:07.980]  entire false flag terrorism this hysteria that the crude provocations that are dished up now
[3:42:07.980 --> 3:42:14.620]  every new uh every week or every month we've got a new false flag terror event completely fictitious
[3:42:14.620 --> 3:42:20.140]  the thing i would say though is the the the people that are in your audience have got to ask
[3:42:20.140 --> 3:42:25.500]  themselves that how long can this depression go on how many more years of depression how many more
[3:42:25.500 --> 3:42:33.180]  years of 15 uh 20 million people without jobs 25 million might the real unemployment probably
[3:42:33.180 --> 3:42:39.660]  20 percent maybe 25 percent if it's uh if it's really bad how long can you go on with this and
[3:42:39.660 --> 3:42:45.180]  still keep the institutions of representative government you know 80 years ago today 80 years
[3:42:45.180 --> 3:42:51.340]  ago on 30th of march 1930 in germany we had the coming of heiner mission polluting who was an
[3:42:51.340 --> 3:42:55.660]  austerity dictator he's the kind of thing that's being prepared in the state of new york and
[3:42:55.660 --> 3:43:02.700]  indeed what obama will turn into next year according to the current uh scenarios um once you get
[3:43:02.700 --> 3:43:08.460]  this kind of austerity going on like everything is cut your pension is taken away uh all the
[3:43:08.460 --> 3:43:13.900]  you know the social spending is looted and look at obama's obama's health plan loots 500 billion
[3:43:13.900 --> 3:43:21.820]  out of medicare it loots medicaid it loots uh the it loots tricare it loots uh you know everything
[3:43:21.820 --> 3:43:27.900]  to give bigger and better bailouts in this case to insurance companies at this point though
[3:43:27.900 --> 3:43:34.300]  we have to have a recovery program in other words a positive program what to do in other
[3:43:34.300 --> 3:43:39.980]  words what do you stand for obviously the anti's anti-war anti-dictatorship anti-wall
[3:43:39.980 --> 3:43:45.900]  street anti-federal reserve but then some kind of a plan at least the basic outline how do you
[3:43:45.900 --> 3:43:50.540]  get out of a depression because the trick with the depression is you don't get out of it automatically
[3:43:50.540 --> 3:43:55.100]  there's no cycle there's nothing that's going to lift you out of it you have to change policies
[3:43:55.100 --> 3:44:01.020]  to get out of it and history teaches that can't be simply cutting everything because the more
[3:44:01.020 --> 3:44:06.460]  you cut these budgets the more you're going to have a bigger deficit in the in the coming year
[3:44:06.460 --> 3:44:11.820]  because if you go to new jersey right the governor christy of new jersey is firing all the public
[3:44:11.820 --> 3:44:17.660]  workers that's just great uh all of those people right now are paying taxes uh once they're fired
[3:44:17.660 --> 3:44:22.460]  they're not paying taxes anymore they're demanding unemployment benefits but that always happens first
[3:44:22.460 --> 3:44:27.820]  they communalize the wealth they get everybody addicted to it then they remove all the services
[3:44:27.820 --> 3:44:32.060]  the taxes go up and it all and whatever's left goes to the banks and i want to get into that
[3:44:32.060 --> 3:44:38.620]  in just a moment webster but before we run out of time here you you talked about how the republicans
[3:44:38.620 --> 3:44:46.060]  have come in and in a bullish manner taken over the tea parties here's a clip from a libertarian
[3:44:46.060 --> 3:44:52.140]  over the weekend at a palin rally what this was in phoenix and all the guy does is stand up and
[3:44:52.140 --> 3:44:58.460]  say you're pro war you were pro banker bailout uh that's the newspaper reported that tv only
[3:44:58.460 --> 3:45:04.780]  caught the part where they tackle him and tea partyers tackle him or jumping on his head and the
[3:45:04.780 --> 3:45:16.220]  police run over and basically uh assault him and help the people that are going after him
[3:45:16.220 --> 3:45:23.340]  uh and then they drag him out and arrest him so you know the same thing happened uh to me back
[3:45:23.340 --> 3:45:26.620]  in 98 when i asked George bush a question at the end of a speech at a press conference they
[3:45:26.620 --> 3:45:31.820]  didn't like it so they drugged me out and arrested me and then later released me but i mean this is
[3:45:31.820 --> 3:45:48.620]  the liberty this is the freedom of the tea partyers here it is
[3:45:48.620 --> 3:46:06.540]  all right and and it it just continues from the news with screaming this is from abc 15 continue
[3:46:06.540 --> 3:46:27.660]  playing it what is your guys issue sir any thoughts about even speaking out at a rally
[3:46:27.660 --> 3:46:31.900]  that you clearly know are the pain and pain and people they're for a statewide race why use this
[3:46:31.900 --> 3:46:37.980]  opportunity to try to say anything i'm trying to save america i like america like americans
[3:46:37.980 --> 3:46:42.860]  i just don't like john mckay and what happened in there once you start speaking out
[3:46:49.100 --> 3:46:49.820]  what's your name
[3:46:49.820 --> 3:47:03.100]  extra 94 you have no right public event i have my rights i don't like obama i don't
[3:47:03.100 --> 3:47:13.340]  like mckay i like ron paul and what was your plan what my family in the war they know it's corrupt
[3:47:13.340 --> 3:47:20.060]  i have a cousin that moved to camber he escaped the military because they were going to threaten
[3:47:20.060 --> 3:47:26.700]  them when he came back home and what were you anticipating the effect would be from speaking
[3:47:26.700 --> 3:47:34.140]  out i knew i was going to get i knew i was going to get hurt but it was worth it why are you guys
[3:47:34.140 --> 3:47:41.580]  trying to help people he went to us an open public event at a big school auditorium he goes in he's
[3:47:41.580 --> 3:47:47.020]  not a liberal he's not a conservative he is a patriot he's a ron paul type supporter and in
[3:47:47.020 --> 3:47:54.380]  america the other citizens don't want to hear him stand up and and and say you know you're pro-war
[3:47:55.180 --> 3:47:59.260]  you were for the bailout and that's what was reported he said so they tackle him and are
[3:47:59.260 --> 3:48:05.260]  jumping up and down on him assaulting him and the police come over and say this is good let us help
[3:48:05.260 --> 3:48:10.780]  you jump on his head let's drag him out and the reporters acting like what did you think he were
[3:48:10.780 --> 3:48:17.020]  going to get out of this this is living in a tyranny where the public is sick mentally you know like
[3:48:17.020 --> 3:48:21.260]  don't taser me bro the guy a few years ago wasn't even resisting he's going why are you doing this
[3:48:21.260 --> 3:48:25.580]  you'll carry was even letting finish letting finish his question they're like no and we're
[3:48:25.580 --> 3:48:29.020]  going and now you're on the ground we're going to taser you three times and you watch him getting
[3:48:29.020 --> 3:48:38.460]  off on it this is fascism this is tyranny and just just to watch the sickness of these people
[3:48:38.460 --> 3:48:44.300]  so if this is a solution to obama it's more of the same webster tarpley i think it's very
[3:48:44.300 --> 3:48:50.060]  interesting the the the line in the tea party between the authentic and honest people and the
[3:48:50.060 --> 3:48:58.620]  ones that are of no no use for anything is the honest ones will all say i'm against the republican
[3:48:58.620 --> 3:49:04.860]  party i'm against the democratic party i reject both this is the beginning of wisdom but what i
[3:49:04.860 --> 3:49:10.460]  found on capitol hill ten days ago in this in this demonstration right before the health bill
[3:49:10.460 --> 3:49:15.580]  was rammed through was that you most of them would say well i'm i'm for the republicans i'm much
[3:49:15.580 --> 3:49:21.180]  closer to the republicans i'm not interested in third parties and uh and so forth so i think
[3:49:21.180 --> 3:49:27.740]  that's what it is on the left side though the people out there uh who's really gave obama his
[3:49:27.740 --> 3:49:34.140]  victory in the primaries uh they're very very angry because of the escalation in afghanistan
[3:49:34.140 --> 3:49:40.460]  you've got this uh this health bill which but let's go back i mean let's go back though here
[3:49:40.460 --> 3:49:46.380]  what about the brown shirt image of a public rally the guy gets up and what they would call
[3:49:46.380 --> 3:49:52.140]  heckles and so they basically beat him up and then he still gets arrested this is the essence of
[3:49:52.140 --> 3:49:58.460]  1938 brown shirts yeah it's outrageous obviously and there's there's no no place for this what is
[3:49:58.460 --> 3:50:05.500]  missing is an organized force that is a third party or something meeting to a third party
[3:50:05.500 --> 3:50:11.900]  that would have an economic recovery program as well as these points about no to the war
[3:50:11.900 --> 3:50:18.220]  defend civil liberties defend obvious democratic rights stop this wall speed domination and and
[3:50:18.220 --> 3:50:23.340]  see is a nationalized the federal reserve and rip that out of the hands of wall speed what i'm
[3:50:23.340 --> 3:50:30.140]  trying to point to is right now the public disgust with both parties is extremely strong and i would
[3:50:30.140 --> 3:50:35.580]  say there are people in the ruling elite who say well anybody who's prominent like yourself
[3:50:35.580 --> 3:50:42.300]  could become a poll of rallying of a of a of an opposition force that would include conservatives
[3:50:42.300 --> 3:50:48.140]  as well as left liberals and people like this uh for the kind of stuff that i but i think i was
[3:50:48.140 --> 3:50:53.100]  i was trying to point out so i think that's why they're so hysterical at this point
[3:50:53.100 --> 3:50:58.140]  because obama has lost his left wing and the republicans have lost their you know let's talk
[3:50:58.140 --> 3:51:04.380]  about where the country is going economically you worry you see the signs and worry about the
[3:51:04.380 --> 3:51:08.860]  future you worry about economic turmoil and food shortages how to be prepared while preserving

[3:54:30.380 --> 3:54:35.100]  and i did it because i wanted to be honest i wanted to stand up against their evil
[3:54:36.220 --> 3:54:40.700]  i understood that historically if my children and their project you're gonna have any future i
[3:54:40.700 --> 3:54:46.940]  have to do this but you don't just get shot out of the media and demonized and you're not
[3:54:46.940 --> 3:54:51.660]  via successful reaching people if you don't play ball then sometimes they come and put you
[3:54:51.660 --> 3:54:55.260]  in prison and kill you but then that just illustrates even more while we have to beat
[3:54:55.260 --> 3:55:01.900]  these people and the good news is they're in trouble on every front and a lot of people in
[3:55:01.900 --> 3:55:08.700]  the system who were in denial about the level of authoritarian system we're going into it's a big
[3:55:08.700 --> 3:55:15.500]  wake-up call and it's just time for people to stop going along with this and for people in
[3:55:15.500 --> 3:55:22.860]  government to start saying no i mean school kids being watched at home off school issued laptops
[3:55:23.820 --> 3:55:32.300]  torture secret arrest legislation to secretly arrest us citizens and torture them i mean you
[3:55:32.300 --> 3:55:38.540]  can't make this stuff up and it's like a bad dream i i can't believe people aren't waking up even
[3:55:38.540 --> 3:55:45.740]  faster but the good news is there is an awakening taking place the question is will it be hard enough
[3:55:45.740 --> 3:55:50.620]  fast enough webster tarbley where do you see the economy going there's no doubt it's now a double
[3:55:50.620 --> 3:55:57.260]  dip recession a new new stupid term we're really in a depression uh the globalists are in trouble
[3:55:57.260 --> 3:56:03.020]  on every front but they don't seem to care webster oh i think they care very much uh we've had iceland
[3:56:03.020 --> 3:56:10.140]  voting 92 percent to say no to the bankers of london and amsterdam we have the greek labor movement
[3:56:10.140 --> 3:56:15.260]  staging two general strikes we had a general strike in italy too on top of that uh and we've
[3:56:15.260 --> 3:56:21.260]  got the hundred campuses in the united states blowing up over this issue of uh drastic increases
[3:56:21.260 --> 3:56:27.420]  in the uh in the tuition at state colleges from california to new york and the system knows it's
[3:56:27.420 --> 3:56:31.420]  only going to get worse so what's their plan to try to block this i mean i mean when i say they
[3:56:31.420 --> 3:56:36.300]  don't care they do care but they're committed to their program and they know they're pushing people
[3:56:36.300 --> 3:56:41.420]  to the boiling point well their their program is budget cuts that kill people at what you say the
[3:56:41.420 --> 3:56:46.300]  the repressive side of the of the current regime clear it's clear but that goes together with what
[3:56:46.300 --> 3:56:50.620]  they're taking away from you they're taking away your economic rights they want to deprive you of
[3:56:50.620 --> 3:56:56.060]  whatever pension health care job unemployment benefits and so forth that you have the tremendous
[3:56:56.060 --> 3:57:01.980]  pressure right now is uh we have the states across the u.s and the larger municipalities
[3:57:01.980 --> 3:57:08.460]  have a combined deficit of 400 billion dollars so what you see is christian new jersey mcdonnell
[3:57:08.460 --> 3:57:16.380]  in virginia uh schwarzenegger the democrat governor in uh in illinois ryan austerity cuts
[3:57:16.380 --> 3:57:24.060]  fire state workers reduce the uh the salaries of state workers if you can uh gouge chisel uh
[3:57:24.060 --> 3:57:29.500]  and ultimately that will that will kill people that actually leads to uh the greater losses of
[3:57:29.500 --> 3:57:35.100]  human life than than uh you know uh the kind of police state violence where's obama in a year
[3:57:36.060 --> 3:57:42.380]  well obama next year at the end of this we reached the end of the uh the stimulus phase now we're
[3:57:42.380 --> 3:57:47.820]  supposed to have now that we we're going to go back to deficit reduction so obama is transitioning
[3:57:47.820 --> 3:57:52.700]  into his role he thinks that he can be the austerity dictator and of course that's very hard
[3:57:52.700 --> 3:57:59.100]  because of the way his his base is set up but in 2011 obama is going to come on the scene
[3:57:59.100 --> 3:58:04.780]  probably with the republican congress in the least one house and he's going to say i will get the
[3:58:04.780 --> 3:58:09.980]  budget back in balance i will make the cuts and the way that he does it is by union busting
[3:58:09.980 --> 3:58:15.260]  remember when reagan busted the air traffic controllers obama is busting the teachers union
[3:58:15.260 --> 3:58:20.300]  right now all right webster we're out of town we'll have you back very soon you've got four
