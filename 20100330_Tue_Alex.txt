[00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:09.753]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.753 --> 00:00:11.354]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:12.915]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:17.098]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.098 --> 00:00:21.181]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.812]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:33.812 --> 00:00:36.354]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:38.537]  It is the 30th day of March 2010.
[00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:43.522]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:53.633]  Coming up in the third hour, Peter Dale Scott, one of the seminal researchers and authors exposing the deep state, the COG,
[00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:59.084]  Black Ops takeover of our nation and the world.
[00:00:59.084 --> 00:01:01.145]  We'll be coming on to talk about a host of issues.
[00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:10.590]  He also appears in Jason Burmess's new film, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:19.475]  And the main reason I wanted to get him on was because I saw this Reuters story and several other mainstream articles last week where
[00:01:21.923 --> 00:01:25.724]  The Russians said, why don't you just eradicate the poppy fields?
[00:01:25.724 --> 00:01:34.086]  And NATO and CENTCOM and others came out and said, we're not going to kill any of the opium fields.
[00:01:34.086 --> 00:01:37.007]  We're going to basically protect them.
[00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:40.828]  This is open narcotics production.
[00:01:40.828 --> 00:01:42.288]  The only fields they kill
[00:01:44.534 --> 00:01:59.503]  But they spray with pesticide, or burn, are those controlled by tribal groups that do not pay their cut and do not ship their opium out through globalist channels.
[00:01:59.503 --> 00:02:01.084]  And this is publicly admitted.
[00:02:01.084 --> 00:02:13.152]  I mean, again, six months ago I heard them admit all of this basically on BBC, but say, oh, this is what we have to do to work with the Taliban groups to make sure the bad Taliban doesn't take over.
[00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:15.560]  We have such an evil government.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.905]  I mean, they're just complete narcotics trafficking criminals, money launderers, Ponzi schemes.
[00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:25.788]  It's just a criminal free-for-all.
[00:02:25.788 --> 00:02:27.569]  So that's coming up.
[00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.553]  In the first two hours, I'm going to get into these militia raids around the country.
[00:02:34.878 --> 00:02:42.159]  Because this is the big kickoff of the demonization of the Tea Parties, of gun owners, of conservatives, of libertarians.
[00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:49.841]  Anderson Cooper saying, this proves the whole federal report, the MIAC and Homeland Security reports put out in 2009.
[00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:50.821]  This was prescient.
[00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:53.382]  This was like psychic powers.
[00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:59.883]  How did the Southern Poverty Law Center, how did the federal government, how did Homeland Security know all of this was going to happen?
[00:02:59.883 --> 00:03:00.803]  Because they're behind it.
[00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:03.882]  They're involved in it.
[00:03:03.882 --> 00:03:08.984]  They've got provocateur informants involved.
[00:03:08.984 --> 00:03:11.886]  Now, sometimes the federal government completely stages events.
[00:03:11.886 --> 00:03:16.748]  They manufacture it from pillar to post, up one side and down the other.
[00:03:16.748 --> 00:03:24.572]  In other cases, they just provocateur it, and it's always hillbilly bumpkins.
[00:03:24.572 --> 00:03:27.474]  And you look at the photographs of these Michigan people.
[00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:31.136]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:46.111]  Or it's young black youths, you know, with half of them being mentally retarded, on record, on welfare, and the feds give them hundreds of thousands of dollars to dress up in camo and march around and they bust them.
[00:03:46.111 --> 00:03:55.337]  Or the feds cook the bomb, train the driver, help them deliver the bomb, protect them to bomb the World Trade Center in 93.
[00:03:55.337 --> 00:04:01.922]  But remember last year, back in August, we're going to play some clips of this.
[00:04:04.642 --> 00:04:21.871]  Coming up today, there's an article up on Infowars.com, the strange case of Christopher Sickles and the militia raids.
[00:04:21.871 --> 00:04:26.533]  The Hotari militia.
[00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:31.136]  And we had the guy on the show and I said, you act like a federal provocateur.
[00:04:33.109 --> 00:04:36.552]  And I said, what's going to happen to you and your buddy's arm?
[00:04:36.552 --> 00:04:41.696]  The feds are going to get you to talk about surveilling a police station.
[00:04:41.696 --> 00:04:43.578]  And then they're going to plant a pipe bomb on you.
[00:04:43.578 --> 00:04:46.140]  And that's in the affidavit.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.001]  That's now happened.
[00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:53.366]  And people are on the message boards and on the YouTube videos saying, how did Alex predict this?
[00:04:53.366 --> 00:04:55.608]  Because they have a manual.
[00:04:55.608 --> 00:04:56.469]  They have a handbook.
[00:04:57.466 --> 00:04:59.667]  We know exactly how they do this.
[00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:00.307]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:01.427]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:01.427 --> 00:05:07.009]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.030]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.052]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that it could even happen again.
[00:05:17.592 --> 00:05:22.816]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:05:22.816 --> 00:05:29.942]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:05:29.942 --> 00:05:31.063]  And here's the best part.
[00:05:31.063 --> 00:05:37.428]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:05:37.728 --> 00:05:40.932]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:40.932 --> 00:05:43.154]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:43.154 --> 00:05:44.095]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:05:44.095 --> 00:05:44.415]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:05:44.415 --> 00:05:47.739]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:49.461]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:04.774]  Your subject is under police action.
[00:06:04.774 --> 00:06:06.035]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:06.035 --> 00:06:09.978]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.978 --> 00:06:12.200]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.264]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:18.064 --> 00:06:24.729]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:30.713]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.713 --> 00:06:34.896]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.896 --> 00:06:39.179]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:41.961]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,
[00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:48.670]  With stage terror and cameras on every street corner, it's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.653]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.653 --> 00:06:51.775]  It's here.

[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.400]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.561]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.972 --> 00:08:28.574]  Senators work on bipartisan climate bill.
[00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:38.578]  They're back, emboldened by the passage of the criminal, unconstitutional government takeover of health care.
[00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:45.332]  Land of the free, home of the brave, now replaced with a credo, the state is God.
[00:08:45.332 --> 00:08:49.754]  We're going to be going over that report.
[00:08:49.754 --> 00:08:56.317]  Also, USA Today finds two-thirds of Americans in their own poll are against the health care plan.
[00:08:56.317 --> 00:08:58.858]  And that's one of the lower poll numbers.
[00:08:58.858 --> 00:09:02.699]  Some polls are now above 80% against it.
[00:09:02.699 --> 00:09:06.481]  The government, being a lawless group of criminals, could care less.
[00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:09.322]  Social engineers hell-bent on running our lives.
[00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:16.236]  We now have the indictment.
[00:09:16.236 --> 00:09:19.357]  We now have the search warrants.
[00:09:19.357 --> 00:09:29.062]  We now have the grand jury indictment.
[00:09:29.062 --> 00:09:34.264]  Dealing with this Michigan militia group.
[00:09:34.264 --> 00:09:37.806]  A group based in Michigan.
[00:09:37.806 --> 00:09:41.888]  One of the Fed's favorite hunting grounds to set up good ol' boys is Michigan.
[00:09:43.832 --> 00:09:53.238]  And I have seen scores of cases where they will find some disgruntled farm owner who's had their property taken.
[00:09:53.238 --> 00:10:09.529]  The feds will create the militia group and it may take two, three, four, five years to finally get somebody to just shoot their mouth off and say, yeah, if it ever comes down to it, you know, we need to go ahead and take out the local police.
[00:10:09.529 --> 00:10:13.252]  Then they hype it up in the media and scare all the little old ladies watching CNN and
[00:10:16.584 --> 00:10:32.869]  Tie it into the tea parties and tie it into yours truly and basically use this as a way to invoke all this fear and get the police all scared and worried about the American people coming after them.
[00:10:32.869 --> 00:10:42.872]  Meanwhile the media plays down the mega threat of the imploding southern border and all the murder for hire going on and police being targeted.
[00:10:42.872 --> 00:10:43.372]  That's a
[00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:54.084]  Backburner issue.
[00:10:54.084 --> 00:11:09.357]  And I've been so right about this for so long, I don't sit here marking down all the predictions I've made, laying out how these people operate.
[00:11:09.357 --> 00:11:13.360]  And quite frankly, sometimes it's just overwhelming to know how these people
[00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:28.034]  are manipulating the population to know what their next moves are, to understand it, and to see it coming like a freight train that's going to run over our society, and to not be able to stop it.
[00:11:28.034 --> 00:11:41.758]  If we could just get the general public to start researching and start looking at these facts, and if we could get mainline Americans to see it as their role and their duty to study the new world order.
[00:11:41.758 --> 00:11:43.539]  I mean, watching Anderson Cooper
[00:11:44.775 --> 00:11:52.641]  Curt Nemo has a five-minute clip of it up on InfoWars.com and an article he's written about it.
[00:11:52.641 --> 00:11:59.526]  And they got POTOC at the Southern Priory Law Center on there.
[00:11:59.526 --> 00:12:00.887]  And they're just following a script.
[00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:08.453]  I've seen it over and over and over again.
[00:12:08.453 --> 00:12:09.374]  And they are getting ready.
[00:12:13.188 --> 00:12:22.175]  The federal government, the criminals that run it, to really stage some horrible events in the next few months.
[00:12:22.175 --> 00:12:28.639]  And I'm here doing the best job I can trying to expose what they're up to, and that's why they're attacking me.
[00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:39.928]  There's several articles out today trying to tie me in with the militia raids, the Hattari militia raids, where you have eight
[00:12:42.315 --> 00:12:59.421]  People that if I was casting for a Hollywood film for Revenge of the Nerds 5, Revenge of the Goofballs 5, this would be it.
[00:12:59.421 --> 00:13:08.204]  And it doesn't matter if it's Muslims or black groups or white groups or whatever the case is, they always get people who are like children mentally.
[00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:10.711]  They're in a fantasy land.
[00:13:10.711 --> 00:13:15.572]  They love dressing up in camo.
[00:13:15.572 --> 00:13:23.774]  It's always led by some patriarchal type person who wants to call themselves general or commander.
[00:13:23.774 --> 00:13:28.856]  And there's so many facets to this.
[00:13:28.856 --> 00:13:34.817]  The federal government goes and preys on these people and finds these people and hypes them up to shoot their mouths off.
[00:13:37.344 --> 00:13:48.034]  So that they can then go back to the Congress and say, we need all this increased funding for Pentagon operations, Homeland Security operations, against the American people.
[00:13:48.034 --> 00:14:03.048]  And they also pick the most buffoonish groups to build up and hype, so that police and military have disdain for what would be a real militia, controlled by the local sheriff, part of the state government.
[00:14:06.744 --> 00:14:14.286]  And so that's another facet of it, is to make it look ridiculous.
[00:14:14.286 --> 00:14:22.888]  And then it's also to demonize the Second Amendment.
[00:14:22.888 --> 00:14:29.450]  But Kurt Nimmo's got a article up, The Strange Case of Christopher Sickles and the Hatari Militia.
[00:14:32.045 --> 00:14:53.114]  And you look at a photograph of this guy, he looks like somebody who worked for the Southern Poverty Law Center, and we know in these arrests, this is five state arrests now, and it's expanding out into New York State and just all over the country, it becomes basically like a military reenactment club.
[00:14:53.114 --> 00:14:58.396]  And these are guys who like to dress up, run around in the woods, like that's the place they're going to be fighting the New World Order.
[00:14:59.471 --> 00:15:05.693]  I mean, the last way you'd want to dress, if you were actually fighting the New World Order, would be in camouflage running around with a 40-pound pack.
[00:15:05.693 --> 00:15:15.575]  No, you'd be driving along on your tractor in overalls with a piece of straw sticking out of your mouth, acting stupid.
[00:15:15.575 --> 00:15:18.296]  I mean, if you were really going to go out and militarily engage people.
[00:15:18.296 --> 00:15:24.618]  You'd pull up in a beer truck, dressed in the beer company's overalls.
[00:15:30.196 --> 00:15:32.137]  I mean that's all this is, is fantasy land.
[00:15:32.137 --> 00:15:44.221]  I've seen different groups in the Republic of Texas and they just declare themselves president from their trailer house and literally I've seen admirals because they own a boat, a bass boat.
[00:15:44.221 --> 00:15:55.946]  You're an admiral if you own a bass boat and it's filled with provocateurs, filled with federal informants and they go out and they find mentally ill people and they set them up.
[00:15:57.173 --> 00:16:14.386]  And for years I get up here and warn you, and I get the people's emails, you're just trying to discredit the militia, you're a big fat Zionist, or you're working for the Vatican, or you're a Scientologist, or you're just jealous of the militia.
[00:16:14.386 --> 00:16:23.153]  No, watching a bunch of Keystone Cop morons running around not realizing this isn't a game.
[00:16:24.258 --> 00:16:26.980]  You're setting yourselves up to be targeted by the government.
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:38.146]  You're wearing the clownish uniform and regalia that the brainwashed police, like attack dogs, have been trained to alert on and to sick.
[00:16:38.146 --> 00:16:40.048]  You're nothing but decoys.
[00:16:40.048 --> 00:16:49.193]  Trained moron decoys sent out to train the government attack dogs.
[00:16:49.193 --> 00:16:53.296]  And I saw this pale horse guy on CNN plugging yours truly.
[00:16:54.457 --> 00:17:18.452]  I saw him in his YouTube videos, and he would have a lieutenant, a chubby lieutenant with a gas mask on, looking like something out of Laurel and Hardy, and he was there with a scary voice changer in front of him with some kind of Mac-10 with a long barrel on the end, right out of Central Casting, and I reserve judgment on it.
[00:17:18.452 --> 00:17:21.054]  I mean, I said my gut told me this guy's a fed.
[00:17:22.478 --> 00:17:24.500]  I knew how Turner was.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:37.910]  He was threatening to tell people to kill police and judges for years and attacking me every day and tied in with Sean Hannity early on when Hannity was infiltrating right-wing groups in New York and Long Island.
[00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.852]  Hannity is a CIA officer, there's no doubt.
[00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:43.334]  Anderson Cooper is admittedly CIA.
[00:17:43.334 --> 00:17:44.815]  I just can't stand these people.
[00:17:44.815 --> 00:17:48.478]  I'm so sick of them!
[00:17:48.478 --> 00:17:51.981]  And they just love setting people up and I've had enough!
[00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:57.230]  But again, they attack me from the top and from below.
[00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:08.476]  They attack me from supposed grassroots as they try to radicalize everybody so that our political message sounds racist and ridiculous.
[00:18:08.476 --> 00:18:12.679]  Then they attack me from the heights saying world government doesn't exist.
[00:18:12.679 --> 00:18:18.822]  I mean, I was watching POTOC and Cooper last night and they said, yeah, these people, they believe there's a world government forming.
[00:18:18.822 --> 00:18:20.183]  It's delusional.
[00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:23.765]  Meanwhile, it's all over TV, all over radio, all over print, a world government's forming.
[00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:29.913]  And so we interviewed the Pale Horse.
[00:18:29.913 --> 00:18:34.015]  Ooh, death, power.
[00:18:34.015 --> 00:18:54.524]  And it turns out he wrote a script for a film titled, well, we'll go over it coming up in the next break, about a serial killer that kills kids.
[00:18:54.524 --> 00:18:56.165]  So he's fantasizing about this stuff.
[00:18:59.907 --> 00:19:10.871]  And he's dressing up like a third world dictator or like Cobra Commander and with a scary voice changer.
[00:19:10.871 --> 00:19:19.815]  And I had him on and I said, look, if you're for real and you're not a Fed, let me tell you how this is going to end.
[00:19:19.815 --> 00:19:25.917]  The Feds are going to come in and they're going to provocateur you.
[00:19:25.917 --> 00:19:27.478]  They're going to pose as other militias.
[00:19:28.677 --> 00:19:40.723]  And then they'll all try to get different groups together showing off and making promotional videos about how cool your training is.
[00:19:40.723 --> 00:19:47.166]  And then they're going to try to get you to talk about, well, what do we do if the police start attacking us?
[00:19:47.166 --> 00:19:53.390]  And they'll create battle plans and get you to talk about attacking police stations or surveilling them.
[00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.491]  And then they're going to arrest you and plant pipe bombs on you.
[00:19:56.491 --> 00:19:57.592]  That's now happened.
[00:19:58.933 --> 00:20:00.634]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:02.414]  Great news for pure water lovers!
[00:20:02.414 --> 00:20:05.275]  The Big Berkey Water Filter is available once again.

[00:20:55.806 --> 00:21:00.791]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:03.113]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:03.113 --> 00:21:05.496]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:05.496 --> 00:21:08.699]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:08.699 --> 00:21:13.824]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.824 --> 00:21:18.008]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:18.308 --> 00:21:20.670]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.551]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:23.551 --> 00:21:26.473]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:26.473 --> 00:21:34.098]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:34.398 --> 00:21:39.781]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.781 --> 00:21:42.642]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:42.642 --> 00:21:46.324]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:46.324 --> 00:21:47.405]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:47.405 --> 00:21:48.746]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:48.746 --> 00:21:50.246]  Invisible Empire.

[00:22:00.512 --> 00:22:04.595]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:22:04.595 --> 00:22:10.480]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.601]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:22:11.601 --> 00:22:15.584]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:22:16.284 --> 00:22:29.655]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:29.655 --> 00:22:35.700]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:41.605]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:24:03.954 --> 00:24:08.678]  I have studied anthropology, psychology.
[00:24:08.678 --> 00:24:16.264]  I have read scores of propaganda manuals that have been declassified.
[00:24:18.832 --> 00:24:31.337]  And what the New World Order does is it creates lots of different niche groups within government and the corporate structure with different psychological types making up those structures.
[00:24:31.337 --> 00:24:36.639]  And the average SWAT team or tactical officer is a hunter.
[00:24:36.639 --> 00:24:44.022]  They have very strong hunting instincts, warrior instincts, and they like to hunt people.
[00:24:44.022 --> 00:24:44.942]  They like excitement.
[00:24:46.072 --> 00:24:53.833]  Most of them are former military people that have seen combat in third world war zones.
[00:24:53.833 --> 00:25:07.596]  And that's why I've always explained to so-called militia people who like to get on message boards and talk about how tough they are and like to dress up in camouflage and run around and beat their chest talking about war all day.
[00:25:07.596 --> 00:25:13.417]  I always try to warn you and explain something to you, okay?
[00:25:15.109 --> 00:25:32.533]  Our founding fathers in the militias of 1775 and 1776 had lived in villages on the expanding frontier and had many family members killed in hand-to-hand combat with the native tribes.
[00:25:32.533 --> 00:25:38.454]  So they were warriors and they'd been in the French and Indian War.
[00:25:38.454 --> 00:25:39.694]  The protracted conflict
[00:25:41.041 --> 00:25:45.864]  Vicious combat, people being scalped, people being tortured to death.
[00:25:45.864 --> 00:25:52.908]  Okay, that's what George Washington came out of as a militia commander.
[00:25:52.908 --> 00:25:56.950]  All over the frontier for decades.
[00:26:02.443 --> 00:26:23.316]  Now, we're here at the cusp of the government trying to start a physical revolution so they can clamp down on our peaceful restoration against their criminal revolution, their corporate takeover of America.
[00:26:23.316 --> 00:26:27.519]  Now, I have warned you people over and over again that this is not a game.
[00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:30.661]  What I do here every day, putting my life on the line
[00:26:31.889 --> 00:26:32.249]  He's not
[00:26:52.452 --> 00:26:55.593]  PR firms, you name it, lined up.
[00:26:55.593 --> 00:27:04.456]  There have been meetings after meetings after meetings in the highest councils of the system deciding exactly what to do with Alex Jones.
[00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:13.919]  And because I've studied history, and because I have been focused, and I put out such a large body of work, they don't know how to come at me.
[00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:20.021]  And because they are so discredited with the general public, when they do attack me, they've found that it actually backfires on them.
[00:27:20.899 --> 00:27:26.581]  But I will tell you this, I am beyond upset.
[00:27:26.581 --> 00:27:28.762]  I'm beyond angry.
[00:27:28.762 --> 00:27:31.783]  I'm just resigned to all of this now.
[00:27:31.783 --> 00:27:39.006]  And I'm just watching it unfold now.
[00:27:39.006 --> 00:27:42.308]  I don't hate the police.
[00:27:42.308 --> 00:27:45.929]  I don't hate the military.
[00:27:45.929 --> 00:27:47.410]  I'm sad for them.
[00:27:48.979 --> 00:27:54.920]  I'm sad for these fools they set up.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.621]  Because I know they're putting poison in your water, police.
[00:27:58.621 --> 00:28:01.162]  That's not my opinion, it's an absolute fact.
[00:28:01.162 --> 00:28:04.903]  I know they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines we all take.
[00:28:04.903 --> 00:28:11.184]  I know they've genetically engineered the major food crops to reduce fertility and to cause cancer.
[00:28:11.184 --> 00:28:17.046]  It's all been publicly admitted.
[00:28:17.046 --> 00:28:18.426]  And I know we're in this together.
[00:28:19.821 --> 00:28:31.170]  Whether you know that or not, and I'm very sad about it.
[00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:39.557]  So for years, they've been forging the identity of the militia.
[00:28:39.557 --> 00:28:41.539]  The federal government has done that.
[00:28:41.539 --> 00:28:46.583]  Leading the militias, creating the militias, running the militias,
[00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.131]  Forging the militias.
[00:28:49.131 --> 00:28:56.393]  That is the public militias that you see on the news every day.
[00:28:56.393 --> 00:28:59.955]  You weren't really seeing the militias on the news a year ago, were you?
[00:28:59.955 --> 00:29:05.857]  But in the last six to eight months you've been seeing them every week and now every day and now every hour.
[00:29:05.857 --> 00:29:08.198]  They're introducing the enemy.
[00:29:08.198 --> 00:29:09.978]  They're introducing the bad guys.
[00:29:09.978 --> 00:29:14.600]  They're introducing the terrorists to everyone.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.021]  So they can go to the next
[00:29:17.305 --> 00:29:25.589]  Stage the next act in the play.
[00:29:25.589 --> 00:29:28.050]  And I get chills.
[00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:33.993]  I'm having chills right now when I think about the next phase in this tragedy.
[00:29:33.993 --> 00:29:35.013]  Oh, it is a tragedy.
[00:29:35.013 --> 00:29:36.794]  It's not a comedy.
[00:29:36.794 --> 00:29:38.875]  It's not an action adventure.
[00:29:38.875 --> 00:29:41.376]  It's a tragedy for everyone involved.
[00:29:43.336 --> 00:29:50.845]  You know, we could wake up to the play, realize it's all scripted, and say, no, we don't want to participate.
[00:29:50.845 --> 00:29:52.247]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.247 --> 00:29:54.770]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:57.493]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.263 --> 00:30:05.565]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:30:05.565 --> 00:30:08.306]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:13.647]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:30:13.647 --> 00:30:18.129]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfallWars.com.

[00:31:05.194 --> 00:31:06.454]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:06.454 --> 00:31:10.375]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:10.375 --> 00:31:12.616]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:12.616 --> 00:31:17.697]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:18.477 --> 00:31:25.141]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.

[00:31:49.074 --> 00:31:51.056]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:51.056 --> 00:31:52.176]  It's here.

[00:32:20.822 --> 00:32:21.943]  Now something fun.
[00:32:21.943 --> 00:32:22.904]  It's springtime.
[00:32:22.904 --> 00:32:30.849]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[00:32:30.849 --> 00:32:31.730]  Here's the plan.
[00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:40.656]  When you add a one-month Superfood Spring Pack to your food storage, we'll send you that garden of non-hybrid seeds absolutely free.
[00:32:40.656 --> 00:32:42.977]  Order now while the free seeds last.
[00:32:42.977 --> 00:32:44.799]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[00:32:49.502 --> 00:32:50.542]  Alright, I want to walk through
[00:33:17.472 --> 00:33:22.614]  Exactly what the ruling class is doing.
[00:33:22.614 --> 00:33:36.419]  The operation they are carrying out, I want to be very specific, on the background, the playbook they're going off of, how they're setting the stage for the next phase in their operation.
[00:33:36.419 --> 00:33:39.161]  But I wanted to go back to a August 17th
[00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:59.460]  Radio slash TV interview I did with a person calling themselves Pale Horse, who's reportedly been arrested as part of this five-state militia raid that's now expanding into other states.
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:05.963]  The headline is, The Strange Case of Christopher Sickles and the Huttari Militia.
[00:34:08.564 --> 00:34:17.811]  And what they do is the feds go in and they infiltrate, they create, in many cases, militias.
[00:34:17.811 --> 00:34:20.232]  And they have them operate secretly.
[00:34:20.232 --> 00:34:23.855]  They create a culture of paranoia.
[00:34:23.855 --> 00:34:33.582]  The feds separately handle the local police and have the local police start harassing their families to intensify the paranoia.
[00:34:35.265 --> 00:34:53.470]  So that they can then nationally promote these groups and bust them one after the other to create the perception of this giant phantom menace that must be dealt with so that the larger opposition to government can be demonized.
[00:34:53.470 --> 00:35:01.552]  And last night on Anderson Cooper's CNN, they were showing a open carry family picnic flyer
[00:35:02.608 --> 00:35:21.658]  And then they were showing clips of tea parties and saying it was the Hattari militia who in the affidavit supposedly talked with federal informants about how they were doing drills and simulated scenarios
[00:35:22.813 --> 00:35:28.558]  Because once they get you in the mindset of, okay, we're preparing for the beast government to come against us, what do we do when they do this?
[00:35:28.558 --> 00:35:48.455]  Well, we hit them on our timetable, we get the cops to pull us over, we kill the cop, and then when they have a funeral procession a few weeks later, we set up Red Dawn-type crossfire on the highway and kill all the police.
[00:35:49.668 --> 00:35:58.856]  And again, even that which was fed to them by the federal informants is designed to enrage police when they see this on national television and hear about it.
[00:35:58.856 --> 00:36:01.098]  It's all scripted for maximum effect.
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.780]  Now, they may not have even talked about this.
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.501]  We've seen the Feds completely manufacture what people supposedly said.
[00:36:07.501 --> 00:36:12.322]  We know their informants are known for lying and framing people.
[00:36:12.322 --> 00:36:20.684]  I mean, we know Dr. Frederick Whitehurst, head of the FBI Crime Lab, quit in 96 and won a big lawsuit, and it was confirmed that they framed almost everyone.
[00:36:20.684 --> 00:36:25.805]  If they were given the orders to frame people, they just framed them.
[00:36:25.805 --> 00:36:28.086]  He now runs the National Whistleblower Association.
[00:36:28.086 --> 00:36:29.606]  We're going to be getting him on very soon.
[00:36:31.519 --> 00:36:32.599]  Interviewed him many years ago.
[00:36:32.599 --> 00:36:36.380]  And you've seen all the other big police departments caught framing people.
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:41.342]  I mean, this is standard operating procedure for law enforcement leadership.
[00:36:41.342 --> 00:36:42.462]  And it's compartmentalized.
[00:36:42.462 --> 00:36:45.863]  Mainly they have good men and women working at the ground level.
[00:36:45.863 --> 00:36:53.285]  And then as you go up through the structure, it's just absolute duplicitous criminals at the top.
[00:36:53.285 --> 00:36:57.906]  And if they identify any officers who are good, they set them up and run them out of the department.
[00:36:59.577 --> 00:37:06.843]  And they've almost completely converted the senior leadership to criminality now, and that's why they're getting ready to move against the population.
[00:37:06.843 --> 00:37:17.172]  But to get the lower-level ranks to go along with waging war on the American people and having checkpoints and gun confiscation, they have to first kill a bunch of cops.
[00:37:20.129 --> 00:37:23.312]  Or attempt to kill a bunch of cops, and then hype it up.
[00:37:23.312 --> 00:37:26.135]  And so that's part of the phase we're going into.
[00:37:26.135 --> 00:37:37.566]  But when I saw CNN, MSNBC, Fox, and others playing video of, oh my gosh, American militia, they're going to get us, with people dressed up in what can only be described as
[00:37:38.547 --> 00:37:52.873]  Pot-bellied people in Cobra Commander outfits, wearing gas masks and World War I helmets, like something out of Monty Python, that I immediately identified that as a multi-faceted attack profile.
[00:37:52.873 --> 00:38:03.617]  Again, it's meant to make the militias look stupid to law enforcement, with untucked uniforms and clown outfits on, with the voice changer it's meant to scare the general public,
[00:38:10.071 --> 00:38:21.098]  And so I began saying on air that I thought this pale horse guy fit all of the indicators, all of the signature points of a Fed.
[00:38:21.098 --> 00:38:38.130]  And they say he's been arrested, but now looking at his profile last night and this morning and doing some research, he fits the bill of an Adam Goddard type.
[00:38:39.198 --> 00:38:42.079]  Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, Deep Cover Operative.
[00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:45.739]  We know it came out in federal documents that McVeigh was hired as that and they set him up.
[00:38:45.739 --> 00:38:47.080]  Look how they're setting up Hal Turner.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.060]  So they do burn their own.
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.820]  So we're not sure.
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:55.622]  And he could have just been played and handled by someone else.
[00:38:55.622 --> 00:39:00.783]  But I want to go to several short clips from the 45-minute interview.
[00:39:00.783 --> 00:39:06.584]  The full interview was posted in the article at InfoWars.com, The Strange Case of Christopher Sickles.
[00:39:07.535 --> 00:39:09.896]  And the Uttari Militia.
[00:39:09.896 --> 00:39:19.342]  One of the men arrested in the FBI and Homeland Security raids on the Uttari Militia in Michigan last week appeared on the Alex Jones Show in 2009.
[00:39:19.342 --> 00:39:22.624]  After it was widely suspected he was a government operative.
[00:39:26.598 --> 00:39:36.244]  Christopher Sickles, aka Pale Horse, a reference to the late William Cooper's book, Behold a Pale Horse, is named in the federal indictment against members of the Hattari militia.
[00:39:36.244 --> 00:39:38.885]  He is reportedly a member of the Ohio militia.
[00:39:38.885 --> 00:39:47.490]  And see, that's how they handle and provocateur other militias, is they'll have pure Fed-run militias, where every member of it is a federal officer.
[00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:48.251]  There's been federal
[00:39:50.339 --> 00:39:58.221]  Court records come out where they'll have Klan meetings with, say, 14 Klan members, and every one of them is a federal agent, so they've had to learn hand signs.
[00:39:58.221 --> 00:40:03.123]  There's been many meetings where they just break up the meeting because it's all feds.
[00:40:03.123 --> 00:40:08.184]  Same thing in Germany, same thing in England, that's in the mainstream news, London Guardian, you name it.
[00:40:08.184 --> 00:40:12.265]  That the modern white supremacist groups in Germany were founded by the German government.
[00:40:12.265 --> 00:40:14.686]  Not infiltrated, not run, but founded.
[00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:19.152]  It turns out he's probably not a government operative, as is originally suspected.
[00:40:19.152 --> 00:40:20.792]  That's Kurt's opinion.
[00:40:20.792 --> 00:40:21.753]  I think the jury's out.
[00:40:21.753 --> 00:40:24.835]  At least not consciously.
[00:40:24.835 --> 00:40:30.858]  And is instead a mentally ill individual who joined the Huttari in order to realize his perverse fantasies.
[00:40:30.858 --> 00:40:35.280]  In October of 2008, Sickles posted a video on YouTube dressed in military fatigues
[00:40:37.056 --> 00:40:41.819]  Wearing a camouflage balaclava over his face and cradling an AR-15 carbine.
[00:40:41.819 --> 00:40:43.960]  He calls on Americans to arm themselves.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.761]  Things are bad.
[00:40:44.761 --> 00:40:45.701]  Things are really bad.
[00:40:45.701 --> 00:40:47.542]  And it's going to get a lot worse.
[00:40:47.542 --> 00:40:49.363]  Our country is in peril, he declares.
[00:40:49.363 --> 00:40:53.486]  The video was viewed more than 70,000 times before YouTube removed it.
[00:40:53.486 --> 00:40:56.728]  In April the following year, Pale Horse posted another YouTube video.
[00:40:56.728 --> 00:41:02.091]  In a second video, he calls for a demonstration of at least one million armed militia men marching on Washington.
[00:41:02.771 --> 00:41:06.152]  No shooting, no one gets hurt, just a demonstration, he explains.
[00:41:06.152 --> 00:41:09.394]  The only difference from the typical demonstration is we'll be armed.
[00:41:09.394 --> 00:41:12.415]  He specifically mentions Alex Jones in the video.
[00:41:12.415 --> 00:41:26.801]  Soon after the first video drew attention, accusations arose that Sickles, then only known as Pale Horse, was a government operative and his video was specifically designed to portray legitimate state militias in a negative and sinister light.
[00:41:27.702 --> 00:41:35.866]  In fact, the corporate media used the Ohio Militia video as part of its campaign to demonize the Patriot Movement in 2009.
[00:41:35.866 --> 00:41:47.671]  On the August 17, 2009 Alex Jones interview, Pale Horse, or Sickles, also, after the corporate media exploited him, as part of an ongoing propaganda offensive.
[00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:50.192]  This is a quote, we're going to play the audio of this coming up.
[00:41:50.192 --> 00:41:55.454]  Either you were doing this to get attention, knowing that putting this mystique
[00:41:56.616 --> 00:42:14.346]  This voice changer on the video, as you call it, would make the media pick up on what you were saying because it was useful to them or you are an out-of-Godin type fed or foundation hired person meant to make the militias look dangerous and fringe and bad, said Jones.
[00:42:14.346 --> 00:42:23.131]  Members of the Hatari militia in federal custody, Christopher T. Sickles is second from the left.
[00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:34.293]  On the second row.
[00:42:34.293 --> 00:42:39.396]  Adam Gadahn is the American media spokesman for Al Qaeda and widely regarded as an intelligence operative.
[00:42:39.396 --> 00:42:41.918]  Gadahn is the first American charged with treason in the U.S.
[00:42:41.918 --> 00:42:44.900]  government since 52.
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.861]  And then it just goes on from there.
[00:42:47.861 --> 00:42:53.065]  And I just look at these people, I mean, classic patsies.
[00:43:01.079 --> 00:43:06.501]  And the types the Feds try to set up are a type.
[00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:10.262]  I mean, they all look the same, they act the same, it's a joke.
[00:43:10.262 --> 00:43:12.023]  And it's like a fantasy.
[00:43:12.023 --> 00:43:27.728]  They're always running around outside their house with guns and looking in the woods and calling each other and driving around on their walkie-talkies and it's like a fantasy.
[00:43:27.728 --> 00:43:29.669]  What the militia should be doing is getting
[00:43:30.987 --> 00:43:56.638]  County Sheriff selected who then deputized them to have soup kitchens and to fight crime and to arrest illegals and to aid police and to wear clean uniforms and to only have members of the militia of the highest standing and no criminal record and of high moral value and intelligence.
[00:43:56.638 --> 00:43:58.239]  But that's what the government's scared to death of.
[00:44:01.274 --> 00:44:09.236]  So instead they make it a secretive thing and they pick out groups that will look the most ridiculous on the news.
[00:44:09.236 --> 00:44:27.441]  Let's go ahead and play the first little clip here of my interview with Pale Horse from August of last year.
[00:44:27.441 --> 00:44:28.241]  Videos he's saying.
[00:44:29.554 --> 00:44:35.537]  Now, let's go ahead and play a clip of Pale Horse.
[00:44:35.537 --> 00:44:36.757]  Here it is.
[00:44:36.757 --> 00:44:39.538]  It has nothing to do with the fact that we have a black president.
[00:44:39.538 --> 00:44:44.720]  I started my group several years ago, before we had a black president, when Bush was in office.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:52.023]  They're trying to make it look as if, all of a sudden, Obama's in office, and now all of a sudden these militants are taking up arms.
[00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:57.906]  I mean, a year ago, before Obama was in office, there was all this stuff on YouTube, there was all these MySpace pages,
[00:44:58.386 --> 00:45:01.288]  Alex Jones was still doing the same thing that he's doing.
[00:45:01.288 --> 00:45:02.909]  It's all been the same.
[00:45:02.909 --> 00:45:05.350]  I'm sure more people have woken up since then.
[00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:10.213]  But, you know, it's not the way that the media is portraying us.
[00:45:10.213 --> 00:45:24.400]  Later, we're going to play some of the actual newscast where they were demonizing him and putting him up there but not really letting him finish a coherent statement.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.742]  That way they could just use the scary sounding voice
[00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.898]  To intimidate people.
[00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:42.338]  And I would think out of the thousands of militia videos that are out there, they probably chose Pale Horse's video because the voice changer he's using to protect his identity does make it sound scary.
[00:45:42.338 --> 00:45:48.882]  And that's meant to scare little old ladies and people living in their inner city crime compounds.
[00:45:48.882 --> 00:45:53.305]  Let's go ahead and go to Pale Horse right now joining us live.
[00:45:53.305 --> 00:45:56.507]  We were able to get him on the show because he contacted us.
[00:45:56.507 --> 00:45:58.469]  Mr. Pale Horse, good to have you on with us.
[00:45:59.076 --> 00:45:59.676]  Thank you.
[00:45:59.676 --> 00:46:02.238]  This is an honor, definitely.
[00:46:02.238 --> 00:46:06.160]  Now, why are you not protecting your voice here on the radio?
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:09.782]  Well, really, you know, I get a lot of things on YouTube.
[00:46:09.782 --> 00:46:11.283]  Oh, the government knows who you are.
[00:46:11.283 --> 00:46:12.664]  You know, why are you covering your face?
[00:46:12.664 --> 00:46:14.405]  Why are you disguising your voice?
[00:46:14.405 --> 00:46:19.808]  And really, it was more, you know, I know the FBI and whoever wants, if they want to know who I am, they know who I am.
[00:46:19.808 --> 00:46:23.410]  And it was more or less as, you know, just to give the video mystique.
[00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:27.112]  And clearly it worked because I ended up on, you know, corporate news.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.461]  Well let me just be honest with you here out of the gates.
[00:46:32.461 --> 00:46:54.047]  I told my staff as soon as they saw this last Thursday when you emailed us, well I've seen it Tuesday and Wednesday on national television everywhere but then I actually watched some of your videos even before to ascertain and really assess from my research who and what you are and then you contacted us and I said I need some more time to look into this but
[00:46:55.009 --> 00:47:18.522]  Either you were doing this to get attention, knowing that putting this mystique on it, as you call it, would make the media pick up on what you were saying, because it was useful to them, or you are a Adam Gadon type fed or foundation hired person meant to make the militias look dangerous and fringe and bad.
[00:47:20.202 --> 00:47:22.063]  I'm not here judging you.
[00:47:22.063 --> 00:47:24.985]  I'm not here saying you're a bad person.
[00:47:24.985 --> 00:47:32.629]  I'm just here to try to really truly assess now talking to you here on air and having more time to look at what you do.
[00:47:33.857 --> 00:47:42.209]  I think this may be more of an art project and that you did this to get attention and that certainly worked, but we're going to try to ascertain that here today.
[00:47:42.209 --> 00:47:49.660]  But instead of me just talking at you, pale horse, tell us a little bit about yourself and about your militia and what you guys stand for.
[00:47:51.561 --> 00:47:55.704]  Well basically, we're just a militia group like any other group.
[00:47:55.704 --> 00:48:11.556]  I started in the Washington State Militia and then upon moving back to Ohio, which is my native state, I began training with the Michigan Militia and I just got real proactive in the movement and, you know, basically just started my own group eventually.
[00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:17.471]  I'm just trying to get the word out there and just train to protect my family.
[00:48:17.471 --> 00:48:24.834]  I think you have the wrong idea of who I am.
[00:48:24.834 --> 00:48:26.535]  I didn't put the video up to get attention.
[00:48:26.535 --> 00:48:29.236]  I had no idea that it would be as big as it was.
[00:48:29.236 --> 00:48:33.217]  100,000 plus views and being all over the news and everything.
[00:48:33.217 --> 00:48:35.178]  I thought you just said you wanted Mystique.
[00:48:36.124 --> 00:48:42.670]  Well yeah, I mean, the idea of the video was that mystique, but at the same time, I had no idea that it was going to go as far as it did, you know what I mean?
[00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:48.855]  I was just telling people to buy guns and basically just prepare for what's to come.
[00:48:48.855 --> 00:48:51.657]  Same as you do.
[00:48:51.657 --> 00:48:55.901]  What are your influences?
[00:48:55.901 --> 00:48:57.722]  I'm actually friends with Mark Hornikey.
[00:48:57.722 --> 00:48:59.323]  He's one of my big influences.
[00:48:59.323 --> 00:49:02.086]  I read the book Behold a Pale Horse by William Cooper.
[00:49:02.725 --> 00:49:03.585]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:49:03.585 --> 00:49:10.647]  Did you read the part in there about holograms and the aliens filming Jesus in a hologram?
[00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:13.047]  And flying submarines in the Bilderberg Group?
[00:49:13.047 --> 00:49:16.088]  Meeting in the Arctic Circle in submarines?
[00:49:16.088 --> 00:49:19.609]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I've heard all the shapeshifting reptilians.
[00:49:19.609 --> 00:49:21.489]  No, no, no, you're not listening to me.
[00:49:21.489 --> 00:49:24.350]  I'm seeing if you actually read that book.
[00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:26.490]  Tell me about that book.
[00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:31.111]  Um, basically it talks about how he was in the Navy at one point and, uh,
[00:49:36.412 --> 00:49:38.273]  This goes on for 45 minutes.
[00:49:38.273 --> 00:49:43.738]  When we come back, I'm going to play the clip where I specifically talk about how they will set them up.
[00:49:43.738 --> 00:49:51.204]  And that's actually in the affidavit, exactly what we said would happen.
[00:49:51.204 --> 00:50:02.132]  If you're going to form a militia, it needs to be out in the open with a code of conduct, and you better record your meetings and everything else, and be out in the open.
[00:50:02.881 --> 00:50:12.023]  That we are patriots, we are defending America, we have a right to defend ourselves against criminals at every level of society.
[00:50:12.023 --> 00:50:26.526]  But I've seen this over and over again, where the feds infiltrate militias, or even mainline other organizations, land rights groups, you name it, and they always try to get them to, well, shouldn't we go surveil the police department?
[00:50:26.526 --> 00:50:29.607]  Shouldn't we do an exercise, you know, just in case things get bad?
[00:50:29.607 --> 00:50:30.767]  We know the police movements.
[00:50:32.967 --> 00:50:40.090]  And then they set you up and tell the police you're training to kill them and then they put you in prison.
[00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:43.151]  Well, that's exactly what happened with this group.
[00:50:43.151 --> 00:50:46.632]  Because they're following a handbook.
[00:50:46.632 --> 00:50:49.393]  The feds do the same thing over and over and over again.
[00:50:49.393 --> 00:50:52.294]  We're going to come back with that on the other side.
[00:50:52.294 --> 00:50:54.235]  Then we're going to get into a bunch of other news.
[00:50:54.235 --> 00:50:54.935]  Open the phones up.
[00:50:54.935 --> 00:50:59.276]  We've got Peter Del Scott coming up and Webster Tarpley in the last hour on the subway bombings.
[00:50:59.276 --> 00:51:00.997]  Get his take on what happened in Moscow.
[00:51:02.324 --> 00:51:03.965]  Is it safe to breathe anymore?
[00:51:03.965 --> 00:51:15.411]  Crowded public places, global pandemics, and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ-killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?
[00:51:15.411 --> 00:51:16.371]  There is!
[00:51:16.371 --> 00:51:20.113]  It's called Sinophresh Homeopathic Nasal Spray, and it's a proven germ killer.
[00:51:20.453 --> 00:51:29.042]  Cynofresh is a revolutionary doctor-recommended nasal spray that kills a broad spectrum of viruses, bacteria, molds, and fungi on contact in your nose.

[00:51:57.337 --> 00:51:58.478]  Use Sinofresh.
[00:51:58.478 --> 00:51:59.018]  It works.
[00:52:01.058 --> 00:52:03.361]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.361 --> 00:52:05.745]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.745 --> 00:52:08.969]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.969 --> 00:52:14.076]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:14.076 --> 00:52:18.282]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.582 --> 00:52:20.924]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.924 --> 00:52:23.807]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:26.730]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:34.317]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.657 --> 00:52:40.039]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:40.039 --> 00:52:42.900]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:46.581]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.581 --> 00:52:47.662]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.662 --> 00:52:49.022]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:49.022 --> 00:52:50.503]  Invisible Empire.

[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.381]  Fact.
[00:53:01.381 --> 00:53:02.723]  Four million people in the U.S.
[00:53:02.723 --> 00:53:04.866]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:53:04.866 --> 00:53:05.386]  Fact.
[00:53:05.386 --> 00:53:09.071]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:53:09.071 --> 00:53:09.692]  Fact.
[00:53:09.692 --> 00:53:15.199]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:53:15.199 --> 00:53:15.480]  Fact.
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:16.080]  I think so.
[00:53:32.799 --> 00:53:33.359]  I think so.
[00:54:23.439 --> 00:54:40.065]  Okay, let's go to this next clip when I was interviewing Christopher Sickles, arrested as part of the Hattari militia out of Michigan, part of a larger five-state raid that appears to continue as we speak.
[00:54:40.065 --> 00:54:46.908]  Here I am in the 45 Minute Interview being specific with him about how militias get set up.
[00:54:46.908 --> 00:54:47.929]  This is August 17th of last year.
[00:54:51.204 --> 00:55:10.914]  I'm not knocking you and a lot of these militia guys get mad because they want to strut around events and camo and walk around acting tough and it's like some kind of adolescent you know deal or something and I see him go to prison I see him get set up anytime somebody's trying to militia yeah we're gonna case out the local police station and then
[00:55:11.354 --> 00:55:18.862]  You find out it's the cops leading it, and they bust you, and they put a pipe bomb in your car, and it's the militia's plan to bomb the police station.
[00:55:18.862 --> 00:55:32.596]  And it comes out six months later in federal court that you weren't planning that, but they got the... The feds created the Viper Militia out of a meth-dealing, toothless biker gang on the West Coast, so they could have the term Viper with Militia.
[00:55:32.596 --> 00:55:34.398]  I've got stacks of news articles here
[00:55:35.785 --> 00:55:39.767]  The Mossad double agent is script writer for Bin Laden tape.
[00:55:39.767 --> 00:55:45.150]  Hardcore Zionist Adam Perlman who once condemned Muslims as bloodthirsty terrorists behind latest scam.
[00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:51.153]  The Intel Center uploaded the Al-Qaeda videos with their own watermark, with the Al-Qaeda watermark.
[00:55:51.153 --> 00:55:51.774]  Okay.
[00:55:51.774 --> 00:55:52.854]  Proof.
[00:55:52.854 --> 00:55:57.677]  So there I am warning him specifically about what they would do to them.
[00:55:57.677 --> 00:56:04.481]  And it turns out in the affidavit from the grand jury, this is exactly what the federal handlers got him to do.
[00:56:05.933 --> 00:56:12.161]  They will also, to protect their assets, they will stage the arrest of their infiltrators.
[00:56:12.161 --> 00:56:20.371]  And that'll come out later, but by then this won't be big news and people will just remember that, oh my gosh, there's these gun owners out there that want to kill police.
[00:56:21.647 --> 00:56:32.831]  And the main mission here is to turn the police and military against American gun owners and to get them into a paranoid or even more paranoid culture.
[00:56:32.831 --> 00:56:45.635]  I mean, folks, I would try to just go to urban warfare drills in California, in Florida, and in other states, and I would have so-called locals show up and say, hey, let's go attack the police.
[00:56:45.635 --> 00:56:48.056]  And I'd say, absolutely not, get away from me.
[00:56:50.111 --> 00:56:59.022]  And then I was trying to build a memorial church for all those that died at Waco, and this operative came around.
[00:56:59.022 --> 00:57:05.971]  He was the Navy SEALS favorite type, about 5'7", real wiry.
[00:57:05.971 --> 00:57:08.514]  I immediately
[00:57:10.089 --> 00:57:17.172]  Identified him as a high-level special forces operator, and he was always trying to infiltrate and provocateur.
[00:57:17.172 --> 00:57:22.454]  He infiltrated some groups here in Austin, tried to provocateur them.
[00:57:22.454 --> 00:57:24.075]  And then I show up in Florida.
[00:57:24.075 --> 00:57:27.396]  I don't tell people what day I'm flying in on, what flight I'm flying in on.
[00:57:27.396 --> 00:57:32.459]  And I walk over to the rental car place, and they go, sorry, we don't have a car for you.
[00:57:32.459 --> 00:57:37.521]  And in, this guy walks, strutting in with his military esprit de corps,
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.000]  He wasn't in a military uniform.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.062]  He said, oh, I've got a car waiting for you and Mike Hanson right here.
[00:57:44.062 --> 00:57:47.883]  Let me take you down to Brooksville.
[00:57:47.883 --> 00:57:50.263]  I guess up to Brooksville.
[00:57:50.263 --> 00:57:53.264]  We flew into Tampa.
[00:57:53.264 --> 00:57:56.145]  And we can go watch the military drills.
[00:57:56.145 --> 00:57:59.526]  And I knew he was a Fed, but I wanted to analyze and see what he was going to do.
[00:58:01.107 --> 00:58:07.710]  And then we get there and interview locals and they go, yeah, the army came to our neighborhood and knocked on our doors and said, don't talk to Alex Jones when he comes.
[00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:09.171]  And it was a drill.
[00:58:09.171 --> 00:58:21.956]  We had this from inside military sources to try to practice taking over an airfield, taking over the town to take detainees out of US cities and fly them out.
[00:58:21.956 --> 00:58:27.339]  To have trucks go door to door, round up citizens and then take them out on those big galaxy aircraft they had landing.
[00:58:28.604 --> 00:58:36.707]  And so I'm just going through the fence at night, trying to videotape this, and he starts trying to set fires.
[00:58:36.707 --> 00:58:42.550]  I mean, and I'll tell you what happens next when we get back.
[00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:45.171]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.171 --> 00:58:48.332]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.089 --> 00:58:54.092]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:54.092 --> 00:58:59.417]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:59.417 --> 00:59:01.479]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:01.479 --> 00:59:06.484]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:06.484 --> 00:59:07.385]  How much do you want?
[00:59:07.645 --> 00:59:08.766]  When do you want it?
[00:59:08.766 --> 00:59:10.647]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:11.727]  When will you need it?
[00:59:11.727 --> 00:59:13.928]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:13.928 --> 00:59:15.269]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:15.269 --> 00:59:16.790]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:16.790 --> 00:59:22.053]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:22.053 --> 00:59:25.655]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:25.655 --> 00:59:29.117]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:29.457 --> 00:59:30.698]  How much will you need?
[00:59:30.698 --> 00:59:31.598]  We don't know.
[00:59:31.598 --> 00:59:32.699]  How much do you want?
[00:59:32.699 --> 00:59:33.640]  All you can get.
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:34.720]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:37.762]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:37.762 --> 00:59:39.984]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:39.984 --> 00:59:40.984]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:40.984 --> 00:59:42.185]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:42.185 --> 00:59:44.006]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:10.025]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-ups.
[01:00:10.025 --> 01:00:11.627]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.627 --> 01:00:12.527]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.527 --> 01:00:17.371]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.371 --> 01:00:23.475]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.475 --> 01:00:27.478]  It was 1998 when I first started having run-ins with provocateurs.
[01:00:30.387 --> 01:00:37.732]  They were going to tear down a veteran's house so we were going to have a community organized event and try to repair it.
[01:00:37.732 --> 01:00:42.195]  And they had plainclothes cops come in and talk about, hey, we need to kill cops.
[01:00:42.195 --> 01:00:47.539]  And I'd follow them out in the parking lot with a video camera and it'd be an unmarked cop car.
[01:00:47.539 --> 01:00:49.500]  And I said, why are you doing this?
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.482]  We're just trying to help an old man.
[01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:54.464]  But see, they don't want any community organizations forming.
[01:00:55.831 --> 01:01:06.659]  The FBI in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s would target mainline soup kitchen operations for the poor if it wasn't part of a big tax-free foundation system.
[01:01:06.659 --> 01:01:09.621]  They don't want us having any communities, so they target everyone.
[01:01:09.621 --> 01:01:18.008]  It's declassified, they infiltrate mainline churches, businesses, everyone gets spied on.
[01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:20.710]  We've got more spies per capita now than East Germany did.
[01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:22.471]  They've had congressional reports admitting that.
[01:01:24.343 --> 01:01:25.864]  It's very shameful.
[01:01:25.864 --> 01:01:43.337]  And so there I am in Brooksville, and all I'm trying to do is talk to neighbors about the military drills, and they're saying, we're not supposed to talk to you, the Army came to our door, that's in police state to the takeover.
[01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:44.158]  So we're out there.
[01:01:46.909 --> 01:01:57.898]  We're just standing up against the fence of the municipal airport, videotaping the drills they were doing of trucks coming in with supposed detainees, loading them on the aircraft, taking off.
[01:01:57.898 --> 01:02:03.902]  They were also doing deployment maneuvers.
[01:02:03.902 --> 01:02:12.029]  And then they send these Humvees, well actually, dune buggies off of the facility.
[01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:15.832]  And we talked to neighbors that, you know, saw them driving around looking for us in the woods.
[01:02:19.839 --> 01:02:24.061]  And then this individual starts getting down on the ground and I say, what are you doing?
[01:02:24.061 --> 01:02:29.543]  He's got a lighter out and he's trying to light grass on fire.
[01:02:29.543 --> 01:02:32.245]  And I start stomping out on my foot and I say, what are you doing?
[01:02:32.245 --> 01:02:35.346]  He goes, oh, I'm setting a fire as a distraction.
[01:02:35.346 --> 01:02:36.907]  I said, setting a fire?
[01:02:36.907 --> 01:02:38.888]  We're news media here.
[01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:48.232]  And I said, look, I knew when you showed up here and I've known for the year you've been hanging around in Austin that you're in the military.
[01:02:49.127 --> 01:02:54.570]  And I said, I can look at your haircut, your eyes, your build.
[01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:58.493]  I said, look, I know you're high level special forces.
[01:02:58.493 --> 01:03:01.795]  And he started laughing and he goes, I'm going to set this fire.
[01:03:01.795 --> 01:03:04.136]  And I had to shove him down on the ground.
[01:03:04.136 --> 01:03:08.839]  And I said, look, you may think you're tough, buddy, but I'm about to stomp your guts out.
[01:03:08.839 --> 01:03:13.902]  Okay, you're not going to set me up with this.
[01:03:13.902 --> 01:03:16.083]  And then, and this all happened in front of Mike Hanson.
[01:03:16.083 --> 01:03:16.944]  He's a witness to this.
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.762]  In fact, call Mike Hanson.
[01:03:20.762 --> 01:03:23.244]  We need to get him on as a guest about this.
[01:03:23.244 --> 01:03:24.425]  We need to talk about that.
[01:03:24.425 --> 01:03:27.908]  I need to go back over my videos and from memory, pull up that guy's name.
[01:03:27.908 --> 01:03:41.999]  I mean, it's just, I just, what I just told you, similar things have probably happened 20 times to me.
[01:03:41.999 --> 01:03:44.661]  Because to the military, I wasn't even a human.
[01:03:44.661 --> 01:03:46.203]  They were going to set a fire out there
[01:03:47.242 --> 01:03:49.543]  I'm an evil American that wants to show what they're doing.
[01:03:49.543 --> 01:03:51.024]  I'm the enemy.
[01:03:51.024 --> 01:03:58.067]  And so they're going to set a fire out there to have it on the news that I was setting fires.
[01:03:58.067 --> 01:04:07.010]  And I'd probably still be in prison right now.
[01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:09.051]  And it's the same thing when my guys went to Pittsburgh.
[01:04:09.051 --> 01:04:10.272]  They called the military.
[01:04:11.564 --> 01:04:14.465]  They say, we want to come and talk to your information officer.
[01:04:14.465 --> 01:04:15.885]  They have their press release.
[01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:19.906]  They go and they say, when can we talk to your spokesman about the military's deployment?
[01:04:19.906 --> 01:04:21.726]  They wanted to ask him about Posse Comitatus.
[01:04:21.726 --> 01:04:22.886]  They said, go wait over there.
[01:04:22.886 --> 01:04:24.267]  And they waited for 20 minutes.
[01:04:24.267 --> 01:04:25.067]  It's all on video.
[01:04:25.067 --> 01:04:27.567]  It's in Police State 4.
[01:04:27.567 --> 01:04:29.508]  The rise of FEMA.
[01:04:29.508 --> 01:04:32.808]  Coming out next month.
[01:04:32.808 --> 01:04:34.809]  And they just said, no, we'll talk to you tomorrow.
[01:04:34.809 --> 01:04:35.989]  Leave.
[01:04:35.989 --> 01:04:37.309]  And then they called the police.
[01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:40.290]  We were trying to plant bombs or blow up the base.
[01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:41.210]  We were up at the perimeter.
[01:04:43.154 --> 01:04:44.817]  We're not even human to these people.
[01:04:44.817 --> 01:04:46.701]  I mean, look, they will frame you.
[01:04:46.701 --> 01:04:48.644]  They will try to frame you.
[01:04:48.644 --> 01:04:50.608]  And you've got to protect yourselves from these people.
[01:04:53.459 --> 01:05:00.524]  But to all you militia folks that just think this is like the next level after paintball, it's not.
[01:05:00.524 --> 01:05:01.824]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:01.824 --> 01:05:07.408]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:05:07.408 --> 01:05:12.431]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:05:12.431 --> 01:05:17.475]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:05:17.995 --> 01:05:23.221]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:05:23.221 --> 01:05:30.349]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:31.471]  And here's the best part.
[01:05:31.471 --> 01:05:37.838]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:05:38.138 --> 01:05:41.321]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:41.321 --> 01:05:43.543]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:43.543 --> 01:05:44.404]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:05:44.404 --> 01:05:44.664]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:05:44.664 --> 01:05:48.127]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:05:48.127 --> 01:05:49.869]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:02.093 --> 01:06:06.054]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:06.054 --> 01:06:14.917]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:14.917 --> 01:06:19.538]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:19.538 --> 01:06:30.362]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:31.002 --> 01:06:40.504]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:40.504 --> 01:06:45.946]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:45.946 --> 01:06:53.427]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:53.427 --> 01:06:56.168]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:07:00.973 --> 01:07:07.658]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:07:07.658 --> 01:07:14.043]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:07:14.043 --> 01:07:20.028]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[01:07:20.368 --> 01:07:25.770]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:33.933]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:07:33.933 --> 01:07:38.014]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[01:07:38.234 --> 01:07:38.534]  Big Brother.
[01:07:38.534 --> 01:07:39.134]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.693 --> 01:08:10.436]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.436 --> 01:08:12.039]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.039 --> 01:08:13.001]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:17.789]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.789 --> 01:08:21.835]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.175 --> 01:08:25.216]  It was 11 years ago.
[01:08:25.216 --> 01:08:27.178]  We went to Brooksville, Florida.
[01:08:27.178 --> 01:08:30.000]  This is just one of the provocateur cases.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.561]  We told no one when we were flying out, when we were landing.
[01:08:32.561 --> 01:08:39.106]  This individual had been getting involved in the anarchist groups, patriot groups, stirring up trouble.
[01:08:39.106 --> 01:08:44.209]  We were trying to build a memorial church in Waco for all those that died, including the BATF.
[01:08:44.209 --> 01:08:45.030]  There's a plaque there.
[01:08:47.287 --> 01:08:56.474]  He showed up at the airport, then he showed up at the municipal airport where they were doing these drills, and they were doing drills in the town.
[01:08:56.474 --> 01:09:01.397]  And, you know, I always talk about these cases, and then I forget we have video of this.
[01:09:01.397 --> 01:09:10.904]  And Mike, I know this was 11 years ago, and you probably have close to a thousand videos, but we need to get the raw footage from police state to the takeover.
[01:09:10.904 --> 01:09:13.686]  I know I've got that somewhere around the office, but you have duplicates.
[01:09:13.686 --> 01:09:15.027]  We've got video of that guy.
[01:09:17.177 --> 01:09:31.287]  And I've seen basically his make and model at all the national security events that we see out there, but I'm just illustrating these malicious and the types of people they infiltrate
[01:09:32.492 --> 01:09:36.974]  And then how they try to carry out the violence, and then they set you up for it.
[01:09:36.974 --> 01:09:42.655]  So imagine, I as a media person go to Brooksville, Florida, north of Tampa.
[01:09:42.655 --> 01:09:44.496]  I guess it's a town of 40-something thousand.
[01:09:44.496 --> 01:09:46.737]  I'm just guessing off the top of my head, a little medium-sized town.
[01:09:46.737 --> 01:09:51.158]  In fact, pull up population, guys, on Google of Brooksville, Florida.
[01:09:51.158 --> 01:09:54.319]  It'll be bigger now, but I want to be precise about that.
[01:09:54.319 --> 01:09:55.620]  Now, Mike wasn't listening to the show.
[01:09:58.493 --> 01:10:01.555]  But I called him during the three minute break and said, do you remember that guy's name?
[01:10:01.555 --> 01:10:06.179]  And he goes, no, but you know, we have video of him.
[01:10:06.179 --> 01:10:16.467]  But I just wanted, I thought it'd be important with my witness to say on record what happened 11 years ago, to illustrate to people how real this is and how serious this is.
[01:10:16.467 --> 01:10:25.474]  And that my guys last year went to G20 as press and the police tried to set them up saying they wanted to attack the military base.
[01:10:25.474 --> 01:10:26.375]  And that was on record.
[01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:27.296]  We have video of this.
[01:10:28.403 --> 01:10:29.704]  Um, with the military.
[01:10:29.704 --> 01:10:36.927]  And then of course we have Luke Radowsky on video outside Larry Silverstein's Building 7, the new one they've built, protesting the inside job.
[01:10:36.927 --> 01:10:45.231]  And the police come over with his security goons and say, we know you're not a terrorist, but we're going to say you've got a bomb and put you in prison for it.
[01:10:45.231 --> 01:10:46.371]  On video!
[01:10:46.371 --> 01:10:52.434]  See, they've been green-lighted to frame people to such a level, they will say they're going to frame you on tape.
[01:10:54.168 --> 01:10:58.090]  And this has all the earmarks in this five-state raid on militias.
[01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:01.752]  Now, Mike, I know I haven't given you but two minutes to try to recall all this.
[01:11:01.752 --> 01:11:05.894]  You didn't even hear the story I told on air earlier.
[01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:08.435]  I asked you and you weren't listening.
[01:11:08.435 --> 01:11:12.938]  Tell us what happened from start to finish in Brooksville.
[01:11:12.938 --> 01:11:15.479]  Mike Hanson, my camera guy of many years.
[01:11:16.408 --> 01:11:19.249]  Hello Alex, glad to hear from you.
[01:11:19.249 --> 01:11:35.674]  What I remember about the young man was that he showed up at Mount Carmel while we were rebuilding the church there as a volunteer and he actually said he was out of the special forces and was on, he was either just out of the military or on leave or something.
[01:11:37.473 --> 01:11:38.814]  And by the way, I know the type.
[01:11:38.814 --> 01:11:40.734]  I mean, this guy, this is the real deal.
[01:11:40.734 --> 01:11:42.615]  I mean, it wasn't an act.
[01:11:42.615 --> 01:11:43.435]  Go ahead.
[01:11:43.435 --> 01:11:49.817]  But he was always trying to, uh, provocateur, uh, different, uh, uh, things.
[01:11:49.817 --> 01:11:57.479]  Uh, and then when we went to Brooksville, we actually flew into, I think it was Tampa or Orlando or somewhere.
[01:11:57.479 --> 01:12:04.461]  Uh, he showed up in a, uh, it was an unmarked, uh, like an unmarked police car.
[01:12:06.531 --> 01:12:08.953]  And we didn't have a ride or something.
[01:12:08.953 --> 01:12:14.457]  I don't know what happened, but he showed up at the airport and was just there.
[01:12:14.457 --> 01:12:15.437]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:12:15.437 --> 01:12:16.678]  He just was there.
[01:12:16.678 --> 01:12:17.499]  He drove.
[01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:23.142]  He said he drove all night to get there or something.
[01:12:23.142 --> 01:12:25.784]  And continue, what happened next?
[01:12:25.784 --> 01:12:31.068]  Do you remember me pulling you aside and going, this guy's a fad, but let's surveil him?
[01:12:32.176 --> 01:12:57.309]  For some reason, I think it was that we didn't have a hotel room or something and he wanted us to come over to his area and I think we ended up, I told you I didn't feel comfortable with that at all because I knew what was going on and I think we ended up getting away from him the first day and then he ended up back with us, is what I remember.
[01:12:59.298 --> 01:13:04.000]  That's right, but tell folks what happened in Brooksville with him.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:18.286]  He was, when we got into the base area, he was always trying to get attention to us, to get us caught while we were trying to film the activities going on there.
[01:13:18.286 --> 01:13:20.787]  He was like setting fires.
[01:13:23.324 --> 01:13:32.366]  Putting flashlights into the airplanes and helicopters to get their attention and all kinds of things like that.
[01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:34.286]  Now let's be clear.
[01:13:34.286 --> 01:13:40.208]  One time he just kneels down in the bushes and starts starting a fire.
[01:13:40.208 --> 01:13:43.308]  What happened?
[01:13:43.308 --> 01:13:49.630]  And that's when they had a spotlight or something and we had to start running for our lives.
[01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:51.430]  You lost your cell phone I think in the swamp?
[01:13:52.642 --> 01:13:54.283]  Yeah, but Mike, let's go back.
[01:13:54.283 --> 01:13:57.925]  What did I do when he started trying to set a fire?
[01:13:57.925 --> 01:14:01.926]  I think you told him that he was a provocateur at the time.
[01:14:01.926 --> 01:14:04.348]  I got mad at him.
[01:14:04.348 --> 01:14:06.449]  Yeah, because he kept trying to do it.
[01:14:06.449 --> 01:14:12.652]  And remember, I shoved him down on the ground and I said, you may think you're tough special ops, but I'm about to stomp your guts out.
[01:14:12.652 --> 01:14:13.732]  You don't remember that?
[01:14:13.732 --> 01:14:14.452]  Yeah.
[01:14:14.452 --> 01:14:14.713]  Oh yeah.
[01:14:14.713 --> 01:14:17.134]  It's been a long time, but I remember.
[01:14:22.119 --> 01:14:23.760]  And again, I've learned a lot more then.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.101]  I would have just waited for the dune buggies.
[01:14:27.101 --> 01:14:30.903]  But it was... I don't even know why we ran to the swamp.
[01:14:30.903 --> 01:14:32.004]  I should have just waited for them.
[01:14:32.004 --> 01:14:35.485]  But who knows, they might have set a fire and killed both of us.
[01:14:35.485 --> 01:14:44.730]  Because they started... They had the helicopters that worked with the spotlights after he did all that.
[01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:47.251]  And so we had to run to get away from them.
[01:14:47.251 --> 01:14:49.112]  And that's when they sent the dune buggies down.
[01:14:53.012 --> 01:14:58.215]  Look, Mike, we cannot procrastinate now that we've talked about this.
[01:14:58.215 --> 01:14:59.796]  Where is the video, the raw video?
[01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:04.679]  I mean, I know I edited it down and put it in police state to the takeover, but he's not in that.
[01:15:04.679 --> 01:15:18.227]  I mean, I haven't talked to you for a while, but what I'm doing, Alex, is I'm going through every single video on VHS before they run and putting it out on the internet to make sure it gets out there on the internet before it runs.
[01:15:18.735 --> 01:15:19.916]  I've been doing that.
[01:15:19.916 --> 01:15:22.678]  I mean, I don't know if you've seen some of the stuff I put out.
[01:15:22.678 --> 01:15:24.240]  The UN flag burning.
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:29.564]  And it's, uh, it's a coincidence I just put that UN flag burning out on the air.
[01:15:29.564 --> 01:15:31.766]  Alright, thank you.
[01:15:31.766 --> 01:15:34.808]  What, are you in a store, Mike?
[01:15:34.808 --> 01:15:40.252]  Yeah, I had to get some moving blankets because I'm getting some appliances for a rental.
[01:15:40.252 --> 01:15:42.454]  I'm actually here in Austin.
[01:15:42.454 --> 01:15:47.038]  And, uh, what happened was, uh, was Alex, oh, uh,
[01:15:47.768 --> 01:15:48.328]  The U.N.
[01:15:48.328 --> 01:15:49.149]  flag burning.
[01:15:49.149 --> 01:15:50.130]  I put that out there.
[01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:51.451]  Your speech on the U.N.
[01:15:51.451 --> 01:15:52.431]  flag burning.
[01:15:52.431 --> 01:16:03.319]  Then I heard on the news that they had just arrested a militia group and part of their deal was they were burning U.N.
[01:16:03.319 --> 01:16:10.745]  flags.
[01:16:10.745 --> 01:16:13.827]  Well, Mike, I appreciate you coming on on short notice.
[01:16:16.015 --> 01:16:19.016]  I mean, I know you were in a store and I weren't listening.
[01:16:19.016 --> 01:16:21.838]  I tell people these stories and I want them to know it's the truth.
[01:16:21.838 --> 01:16:28.341]  I mean, this is what you get when you just try to go cover an urban warfare takeover drill.
[01:16:28.341 --> 01:16:32.523]  You can't explain to the people.
[01:16:32.523 --> 01:16:40.707]  You'd have to write a book about what happened that time, but there's been a lot of cases, and it's still happening, where these provocateurs show up.
[01:16:40.707 --> 01:16:44.769]  The doctors are the provocateurs that showed up at Mount Carmel trying to stab you.
[01:16:46.323 --> 01:16:47.584]  Yeah, I forgot that.
[01:16:47.584 --> 01:16:56.250]  They later admitted that they were federal informants, and the woman came in with a butcher knife.
[01:16:56.250 --> 01:16:58.091]  That was not fun.
[01:16:58.091 --> 01:17:02.934]  And, way back too, there was a federal agent that infiltrated
[01:17:04.737 --> 01:17:20.424]  When I used to have to hire people as workers, he said that he didn't have any money, but he had this nice apartment, and you found out later that he was trying to infiltrate your organization.
[01:17:20.424 --> 01:17:25.307]  And you know who that is, he got on the radio and told you.
[01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:27.828]  That's right, that guy later admitted he was a fed.
[01:17:27.828 --> 01:17:28.368]  Such scum.
[01:17:44.277 --> 01:17:46.458]  Well, Mike, I appreciate you coming on.
[01:17:46.458 --> 01:17:49.340]  I just thought, why should I sit here and say Mike Hampton was there?
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:53.142]  Why not just get him on and have him tell the story?
[01:17:53.142 --> 01:17:55.724]  Oh, then somebody broke in our hotel room and stole the $500 I'd left in there.
[01:17:57.369 --> 01:18:01.690]  Yeah, and I think, you know, that they found us, too.
[01:18:01.690 --> 01:18:08.692]  I mean, they, you know, they ended up, he ended up finding us over at that other hotel, that same Provocateur.
[01:18:08.692 --> 01:18:21.716]  And while I'm on here talking about old footage of yours, Alex, what I'm doing is I'm going through these VHS tapes and I got a computer guy trying to get the best quality out of them.
[01:18:21.716 --> 01:18:23.397]  He's putting them on
[01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:32.252]  My YouTube channel, free of charge, you can see Alex Jones when he was looking really good.
[01:18:32.252 --> 01:18:36.295]  Back in the early 90s and 97, 98, all that.
[01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:40.097]  And Mike Hanson Archive on YouTube.
[01:18:40.097 --> 01:18:41.658]  Now we link to it all the time, Mike.
[01:18:41.658 --> 01:18:43.919]  Yeah, I know you do.
[01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:49.663]  And there's some really good features that, and it really, you know, it's still
[01:18:50.738 --> 01:18:55.039]  The speeches that you did back in the 90s are still holding true today.
[01:18:55.039 --> 01:18:59.320]  So it's just, you know, people don't even know what date it is.
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:04.821]  They think if we don't put the date, they always say, hey, when did he give this speech?
[01:19:04.821 --> 01:19:07.962]  Yeah, because everything we talked about came true.
[01:19:07.962 --> 01:19:10.242]  So that's what I'm trying to do for my little part now.
[01:19:10.242 --> 01:19:14.183]  I have to run my business, but I'm really trying to go through this warehouse.
[01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:17.884]  I literally got a warehouse full of old VHS tape.
[01:19:17.884 --> 01:19:19.324]  Well, Mike, in closing.
[01:19:20.458 --> 01:19:27.622]  Now that we've talked about it, you need to immediately dig through and find that guy at Waco or the Brooksville footage.
[01:19:27.622 --> 01:19:33.746]  We've got to get that out now because we need to expose that guy.
[01:19:33.746 --> 01:19:36.608]  Okay, I'll work on that next.
[01:19:37.861 --> 01:19:41.283]  Because I can't believe how stupid I was.
[01:19:41.283 --> 01:19:46.707]  I mean, I knew it was dangerous and bad, and I stopped him, but I should have called the police on him right then.
[01:19:46.707 --> 01:19:47.548]  I should have.
[01:19:47.548 --> 01:19:52.972]  I mean, just the danger we've been in all these years, and we just walk point like it's no big deal.
[01:19:52.972 --> 01:19:57.095]  And we wouldn't be here, Mike, if it wasn't for people's prayers and God above.
[01:19:57.095 --> 01:19:57.815]  Thanks a lot, Mike.
[01:19:57.815 --> 01:19:58.436]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:58.436 --> 01:19:58.816]  Stay with us.

[01:21:09.209 --> 01:21:13.695]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[01:22:00.765 --> 01:22:02.506]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:02.506 --> 01:22:03.086]  March 30th, 2010.
[01:22:03.086 --> 01:22:05.827]  Gold opened this morning at $11.1120.
[01:22:05.827 --> 01:22:14.789]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11.4158, $5.7079 for a half ounce, or $2.8540 for the quarter ounce.
[01:22:14.789 --> 01:22:17.870]  That's $11.4158, $5.7079, and $2.8540.
[01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:21.911]  We have always believed our country was about expanding opportunity for Americans.
[01:22:21.911 --> 01:22:27.133]  With the passage of the sweeping health care reform, working middle class Americans are getting the short end of the stick.
[01:22:27.353 --> 01:22:31.815]  The health care mandate will require almost every American to be insured or else pay a fine.
[01:22:31.815 --> 01:22:33.976]  This means less control over your finances.
[01:22:33.976 --> 01:22:36.338]  Take back control by trading in precious metals.
[01:22:36.338 --> 01:22:41.940]  Gold and silver have always been and continues to be the leading way to protect against our weakening markets.

[01:24:18.679 --> 01:24:22.902]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do.
[01:24:22.902 --> 01:24:27.545]  Throughout the rest of this hour, I'm going to continue, in a nutshell, to break down
[01:24:45.851 --> 01:24:54.695]  This PsyOps propaganda and how it's working and how they're carrying it out, how they're doing it.
[01:24:54.695 --> 01:25:01.238]  And we are going to open the phones up specifically for militia.
[01:25:01.238 --> 01:25:14.604]  Militia members who've had groups try to infiltrate them or who have kicked out provocateurs, folks from Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and other states where this is happening.
[01:25:15.759 --> 01:25:15.839]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:25:15.839 --> 01:25:15.939]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:25:15.939 --> 01:25:17.080]  But in a nutshell, it's simple.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:21.665]  The establishment politically is engaged in revolution against the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[01:25:21.665 --> 01:25:22.706]  They're engaged in treason.
[01:25:36.556 --> 01:25:45.019]  And they know what they've done politically is political suicide, unless they stage terror attacks and provocateur events to demonize their opposition.
[01:25:45.019 --> 01:25:46.120]  And who are they going to demonize?
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.120]  The Tea Parties.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.521]  With the airplane attack.
[01:25:48.521 --> 01:25:50.061]  And the Pentagon shooting.
[01:25:50.061 --> 01:25:51.182]  And now with these militias.
[01:25:51.182 --> 01:25:56.404]  And I told you months before all this started, this would heat up in March and April.
[01:25:56.404 --> 01:26:01.586]  And I believe it is going to peak in this next level in late April.
[01:26:03.598 --> 01:26:06.081]  Because I've seen them do it over and over again.
[01:26:06.081 --> 01:26:08.003]  I have experienced it.
[01:26:08.003 --> 01:26:11.066]  You know, I psychologically pretty much have suppressed all the stuff I've been through.
[01:26:11.066 --> 01:26:19.535]  I mean, Mike just reminded me how some woman came at me with a huge butcher knife and I jumped out of the way and she said, I'm gonna kill you.
[01:26:19.535 --> 01:26:20.296]  I'm a fed.
[01:26:20.296 --> 01:26:21.738]  There's nothing you can do.
[01:26:21.738 --> 01:26:25.522]  And then the police showed up minutes after no one had called him saying,
[01:26:27.236 --> 01:26:28.997]  Behaving like I'd done something wrong.
[01:26:28.997 --> 01:26:39.021]  I guess they're ready to kill me, or stab me, and then say that I had attacked them.
[01:26:39.021 --> 01:26:42.082]  And it's happened so many times.
[01:26:42.082 --> 01:26:52.307]  I mean, I can't go to a book signing, a video signing, at a movie theater, at a bookstore, at a gun show, without somebody walking up, you know, informant types,
[01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:54.622]  You know what a criminal looks like.
[01:26:54.622 --> 01:26:57.445]  It's in the eyes, it's in the demeanor, it's in the predatoriness.
[01:26:57.445 --> 01:26:59.767]  You know what a federal agent looks like.
[01:26:59.767 --> 01:27:02.970]  You know what a state police informant looks like.
[01:27:02.970 --> 01:27:05.573]  What a state police intelligence officer looks like.
[01:27:05.573 --> 01:27:08.216]  You know what a special ops looks like.
[01:27:08.216 --> 01:27:13.801]  You know what a national security level Delta operator looks like.
[01:27:13.801 --> 01:27:15.283]  You know what a Navy SEAL looks like.
[01:27:17.466 --> 01:27:31.819]  I remember when I was down there covering the protest during the contested election in 2000 at the Governor's Mansion, and they'd have Secret Service guys come over dressed in plain clothes, and I'd go, you're Secret Service, and they'd laugh and say, I am, Jones, and just shove me.
[01:27:31.819 --> 01:27:35.502]  And then they'd have another guy walk up and I'd go, you're a Navy SEAL.
[01:27:35.502 --> 01:27:39.305]  And the guy would laugh and go, ha ha ha, Jones, and just walk on by.
[01:27:39.305 --> 01:27:41.147]  You're a, I mean, I just know these people.
[01:27:41.147 --> 01:27:42.368]  I've been around them so much.
[01:27:42.368 --> 01:27:43.309]  I know all the different groups.
[01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:49.231]  Most of these Navy SEAL operators, for some reason they pick them really small.
[01:27:49.231 --> 01:27:59.255]  I mean, they've found that that's a... I guess it's a Napoleonic complex and they're... and a lot of other psychological things go into it.
[01:27:59.255 --> 01:28:00.795]  It's a whole body type.
[01:28:00.795 --> 01:28:02.236]  It's everything.
[01:28:02.236 --> 01:28:03.456]  I've just been around it so much.
[01:28:03.456 --> 01:28:04.216]  I mean, they don't even hide it.
[01:28:04.216 --> 01:28:07.897]  They'll have Navy anchors on their shoulders.
[01:28:07.897 --> 01:28:13.519]  I mean, it's not even... They think you're so stupid.
[01:28:13.519 --> 01:28:15.040]  That's like Governor Ventura when he...
[01:28:18.325 --> 01:28:21.308]  Two weeks into office, they call him into the bottom of the basement of the Capitol.
[01:28:21.308 --> 01:28:24.511]  There's 23 CIA officers there, basically trying to boss him around.
[01:28:24.511 --> 01:28:27.254]  I mean, folks, it's such a police state.
[01:28:27.254 --> 01:28:28.315]  The government's so evil.
[01:28:29.306 --> 01:28:34.851]  It's trillions in weapons sales, trillions in drug sales, illegal and legal.
[01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:37.554]  They got CPS rings kidnapping kids for the elite.
[01:28:37.554 --> 01:28:39.796]  It's just as evil as you can imagine.
[01:28:39.796 --> 01:28:45.841]  And I just want the police and military to know, most of you are compartmentalized and aren't part of this larger operation.
[01:28:45.841 --> 01:28:48.984]  And please, for heaven's sakes, research what I've talked about.
[01:28:51.391 --> 01:29:03.846]  Look at the issues that we've covered here and realize that it's so wicked I can't even cover it all.
[01:29:03.846 --> 01:29:06.329]  And so they want to wage war on the American people.
[01:29:06.329 --> 01:29:08.372]  They've built up this homeland security system.
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:15.744]  And they now want to go after their enemy, the middle class, people that have wealth.
[01:29:15.744 --> 01:29:17.265]  All the taxes are being raised.
[01:29:17.265 --> 01:29:19.147]  New taxes are being invented.
[01:29:19.147 --> 01:29:21.609]  Every tax under the sun is being implemented and raised.
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:29.902]  And they're going to squeeze and squeeze, and the Pentagon thinks they can take this country down.
[01:29:29.902 --> 01:29:31.823]  You know, Eisenhower warned you about it.
[01:29:31.823 --> 01:29:35.464]  He said a scientific and technological elite had taken control.
[01:29:35.464 --> 01:29:38.766]  And they have, and I'm just a person who wants freedom in my republic.
[01:29:38.766 --> 01:29:40.666]  I am an American first.
[01:29:40.666 --> 01:29:43.487]  I am a constitutionalist.
[01:29:43.487 --> 01:29:47.549]  And it's just so horrible knowing they're setting all this up.
[01:29:47.549 --> 01:29:51.091]  I'll tell you what's coming next when we get back.
[01:29:51.091 --> 01:29:52.491]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.491 --> 01:29:54.012]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.998 --> 01:30:00.562]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.562 --> 01:30:04.706]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:30:04.706 --> 01:30:05.947]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:05.947 --> 01:30:09.890]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.890 --> 01:30:12.112]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.112 --> 01:30:17.216]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:17.976 --> 01:30:24.638]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.638 --> 01:30:30.619]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.619 --> 01:30:34.800]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:39.081]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.081 --> 01:30:41.882]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,
[01:30:42.302 --> 01:30:45.043]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.043 --> 01:30:48.584]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.584 --> 01:30:50.564]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.564 --> 01:30:51.685]  It's here.

[01:31:07.457 --> 01:31:12.580]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:21.305]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:31:21.305 --> 01:31:25.387]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:31:25.387 --> 01:31:27.348]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:31:29.687 --> 01:31:34.411]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:31:34.411 --> 01:31:38.254]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:31:38.254 --> 01:31:39.475]  Others don't.
[01:31:39.475 --> 01:31:41.617]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:31:41.617 --> 01:31:43.398]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:31:43.398 --> 01:31:46.300]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:50.544]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.871]  Others don't.
[01:32:00.899 --> 01:32:03.920]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:09.243]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:09.243 --> 01:32:11.283]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:11.283 --> 01:32:16.286]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:16.286 --> 01:32:17.466]  How much do you want?
[01:32:17.466 --> 01:32:18.607]  When do you want it?
[01:32:18.607 --> 01:32:20.487]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:20.487 --> 01:32:21.548]  When will you need it?
[01:32:21.548 --> 01:32:23.769]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:23.769 --> 01:32:25.109]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:25.109 --> 01:32:26.410]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:26.610 --> 01:32:31.876]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:31.876 --> 01:32:35.481]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.481 --> 01:32:39.305]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:39.305 --> 01:32:40.526]  How much will you need?
[01:32:40.526 --> 01:32:41.427]  We don't know.
[01:32:41.427 --> 01:32:42.529]  How much do you want?
[01:32:42.529 --> 01:32:43.270]  All you can get.
[01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:44.271]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:44.491 --> 01:32:46.212]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
[01:33:07.276 --> 01:33:10.879]  Okay, I'm gonna go to Kevin, Tim, Chris, and others.
[01:33:10.879 --> 01:33:22.669]  Specifically, if you're in a militia, or you have intel and live in one of the states where this has happened, or if someone's ever tried to provocateur or set you up for your political activities.
[01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:23.449]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:23.449 --> 01:33:32.517]  But on a separate issue, last Friday, CNN called me.
[01:33:32.517 --> 01:33:36.320]  By the way, we are simulcasting now at PrisonPlanet.tv in the last two and a half hours of the show.
[01:33:37.406 --> 01:33:41.352]  Last Friday, CNN called towards the end of the show and said, we want to put you live on tonight.
[01:33:41.352 --> 01:33:49.004]  By the time I got off air, it was, oh, we want you to come down in an hour and do a taping via satellite from a satellite uplink office down by the Capitol.
[01:33:51.465 --> 01:33:56.870]  And I said, let me guess, you'll interview me 10, 15, 20 minutes, and 30 seconds, I'll end up being in the show.
[01:33:56.870 --> 01:34:00.373]  And they said, it is a show about you, are you causing violence?
[01:34:00.373 --> 01:34:03.455]  And notice, they're doing this right ahead of the weekend raids.
[01:34:03.455 --> 01:34:15.585]  Guaranteed, they were queued in, that's basically all CNN's covering right now, is the evil militias, worse than Al-Qaeda, evil American gun owners are everywhere, we've gotta have naked body scanners on the streets, oh my God, the militia's so deadly.
[01:34:15.585 --> 01:34:19.489]  Meanwhile, the Mexican mafia is killing hundreds of people every few days in the U.S.,
[01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:21.610]  Thousands every few weeks.
[01:34:21.610 --> 01:34:24.752]  It's thousands every few weeks now in Mexico.
[01:34:24.752 --> 01:34:29.655]  That's not a problem, an actual real threat.
[01:34:29.655 --> 01:34:39.181]  No, it's this imaginary fake militia that they provocateured and created to then demonize the idea of an armed citizenry.
[01:34:39.181 --> 01:34:40.682]  So all of this is coming together.
[01:34:40.682 --> 01:34:48.007]  I'm the big enemy of all these TV networks now and newspapers and magazines, London Guardian, New York Times, Time Magazine, Newsweek.
[01:34:49.346 --> 01:34:51.087]  I'm calling for violence.
[01:34:51.087 --> 01:34:51.868]  Of course, none of it's true.
[01:34:51.868 --> 01:35:01.694]  I'm saying don't be violent, and I'm exposing how much of this is provocateured, and I'm exposing false flag terror, and how they're building up for a repeat of 1995 this April.
[01:35:01.694 --> 01:35:05.336]  All the indicators are there.
[01:35:05.336 --> 01:35:07.297]  And you've seen I've been right this far.
[01:35:07.297 --> 01:35:10.219]  If we get the word out, we might be able to blow their operations.
[01:35:10.219 --> 01:35:12.220]  That's why they're mad.
[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:14.522]  And yes, I'm in danger, folks.
[01:35:14.522 --> 01:35:17.724]  I mean, 11 years ago, I had them trying to set me up.
[01:35:20.169 --> 01:35:26.973]  Somebody just shows up, I'm there with a video camera and they start lighting fires saying I did it.
[01:35:26.973 --> 01:35:30.735]  And I'm like stomping on it.
[01:35:30.735 --> 01:35:32.095]  So this is real, okay?
[01:35:32.095 --> 01:35:33.276]  I live in the real world.
[01:35:33.276 --> 01:35:35.137]  You're not tuned into entertainment.
[01:35:35.137 --> 01:35:38.358]  You're not tuned into somebody who's here just to be a big radio host.
[01:35:38.358 --> 01:35:43.341]  Okay, I'm putting my life on the line here to warn you because you are the target if they're able to bring this system in.
[01:35:43.341 --> 01:35:48.964]  It's like Hitler beta tested stuff on Jews and a few other unpopular minorities, but really it was for everybody.
[01:35:49.974 --> 01:35:55.096]  So they're beta testing this right now on Muslims, on gun owners, on conservatives, on libertarians.
[01:35:55.096 --> 01:35:58.097]  They tell conservatives we're doing it to stop Muslims.
[01:35:58.097 --> 01:36:01.059]  They tell the liberals we're doing this to stop the evil gun owners.
[01:36:01.059 --> 01:36:06.601]  But the main target of this is the American conservative or libertarian or gun owner.
[01:36:06.601 --> 01:36:10.262]  We know the Democrats have been caught in Denver and other areas attacking their own offices.
[01:36:10.262 --> 01:36:13.024]  That's the Denver Post.
[01:36:13.024 --> 01:36:15.905]  Almost all of this is provocateured or completely staged.
[01:36:17.290 --> 01:36:29.317]  I go on CNN, you know, it's a taped interview, and I taped it because I didn't want them to take me out of context, and I said in the YouTube video from Friday, I said, I don't even know if they're going to air this.
[01:36:29.317 --> 01:36:33.239]  They said they were, but in my experience, they've interviewed me before, they don't air it.
[01:36:34.855 --> 01:36:41.618]  And then the spin machine went into the conspiracy theory that I staged this and I wasn't interviewed by CNN.
[01:36:41.618 --> 01:36:43.579]  Like, I care about being interviewed by CNN, folks.
[01:36:43.579 --> 01:36:46.520]  I'm on BBC, Russia Today, Fox.
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:49.882]  I mean, I've been on CNN, I don't know, probably 10 times over the years.
[01:36:49.882 --> 01:36:50.963]  It does nothing.
[01:36:50.963 --> 01:36:53.144]  No traffic to the website.
[01:36:53.144 --> 01:36:56.745]  They always take it out of context.
[01:36:56.745 --> 01:36:59.186]  It's the mouse that roared.
[01:36:59.186 --> 01:37:01.047]  Their top shows have a million viewers.
[01:37:01.047 --> 01:37:01.708]  Most of their shows have 200,000.
[01:37:03.502 --> 01:37:08.685]  A big radio show in Chicago has more than the average CNN show.
[01:37:08.685 --> 01:37:11.567]  Rush Limbaugh's got 10 million a day.
[01:37:11.567 --> 01:37:15.830]  No, I was interviewed by CNN.
[01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:24.475]  But it's so pathetic that people would, when I made it clear that they taped it, I don't know if they're going to air it, but I'm showing you what I said to them.
[01:37:24.475 --> 01:37:25.936]  I'm showing you what really gets said.
[01:37:26.843 --> 01:37:30.124]  And then, but it doesn't matter, anything and everything I do gets attacked.
[01:37:30.124 --> 01:37:34.566]  But I thought I'd do this because I wanted to call him anyways, and I've gotten busy and didn't do it yesterday.
[01:37:34.566 --> 01:37:38.988]  I want to call the CNN producer that called me right now live on air.
[01:37:38.988 --> 01:37:39.949]  We'll see if she answers.
[01:37:39.949 --> 01:37:41.389]  If not, we'll try back later.
[01:37:41.389 --> 01:37:44.131]  And I'm going to ask, you said that was going to air that night.
[01:37:44.131 --> 01:37:45.691]  Is it going to air?
[01:37:45.691 --> 01:37:50.713]  And then you can later call Justine Redman if you won't.
[01:37:50.713 --> 01:37:54.055]  I mean, if she won't tell us what's going on, you're welcome to call her.
[01:37:56.257 --> 01:38:01.959]  So go ahead and call Justine Redmond, CNN producer, right now live on air.
[01:38:01.959 --> 01:38:05.820]  And I also told people the name of the production company, the Satellite Uplink facility.
[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:06.640]  What's the name of it again?
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:07.760]  Rayguy Productions?
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:09.481]  Rayguy Productions in Austin.
[01:38:09.481 --> 01:38:10.721]  4 o'clock Friday.
[01:38:10.721 --> 01:38:11.941]  CNN.
[01:38:11.941 --> 01:38:13.922]  Hey, is this Justine Redmond?
[01:38:13.922 --> 01:38:15.042]  It is.
[01:38:15.042 --> 01:38:16.463]  Hey, listen, this is Alex Jones.
[01:38:16.463 --> 01:38:20.544]  I just needed to get this on record because some people were saying I wasn't even really interviewed by CNN.
[01:38:20.544 --> 01:38:21.444]  We're live right now.
[01:38:21.444 --> 01:38:23.845]  You guys did interview me Friday, correct?
[01:38:23.845 --> 01:38:24.185]  We did.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.442]  And, uh, how come you didn't air it?
[01:38:27.442 --> 01:38:34.088]  Um, I think we had some breaking news that night, um, and had to change the show around, but we're hoping we can air it tonight.
[01:38:34.088 --> 01:38:34.569]  Oh, really?
[01:38:34.569 --> 01:38:35.449]  Tonight?
[01:38:35.449 --> 01:38:36.711]  Yep.
[01:38:36.711 --> 01:38:41.315]  And, uh, of the 15-minute interview, what about 30 seconds?
[01:38:41.315 --> 01:38:43.116]  Um, I haven't timed it out.
[01:38:43.116 --> 01:38:46.920]  It's a pretty long story by our standard.
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:49.542]  But, I mean, how long am I in the piece?
[01:38:49.542 --> 01:38:50.343]  I'd have to go and check.
[01:38:50.779 --> 01:38:52.160]  Well, I appreciate you talking to us.
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.460]  Just one more question.
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:56.782]  Did you guys get tipped off by the Feds about the militia raids coming up?
[01:38:56.782 --> 01:38:59.123]  Is that why you interviewed me Friday?
[01:38:59.123 --> 01:39:00.284]  So you could have me involved in that?
[01:39:00.284 --> 01:39:04.026]  No, absolutely not.
[01:39:04.026 --> 01:39:08.048]  Did you guys enjoy the interview?
[01:39:08.048 --> 01:39:09.589]  Yes, it was very interesting.
[01:39:09.589 --> 01:39:11.610]  Thank you.
[01:39:11.610 --> 01:39:15.072]  Well, have you seen the YouTube posting?
[01:39:15.072 --> 01:39:18.114]  Because I shot video of my questions and my answers.
[01:39:18.114 --> 01:39:18.614]  No, I haven't.
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:31.365]  I mean, we don't have the questions on tape, we just shot with a little camera flip phone, but my response is because I wanted people to actually see what I had to say and not out of context.
[01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:33.266]  Great, no I haven't seen it.
[01:39:33.266 --> 01:39:36.887]  So this is probably going to air tonight on Anderson Cooper?
[01:39:36.887 --> 01:39:38.608]  It's looking that way at the moment.
[01:39:38.608 --> 01:39:44.010]  As you know, live broadcasts can change very quickly, but that's the plan so far.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.246]  Yeah, Friday night I guess you guys doubled down and did what, 30 minutes on Sarah Palin?
[01:39:50.246 --> 01:39:51.947]  Did we?
[01:39:51.947 --> 01:40:00.236]  Is she as big a ratings getter as Anderson swimming around with sharks?
[01:40:00.236 --> 01:40:01.577]  I don't know about that.
[01:40:01.577 --> 01:40:04.981]  Hey, what was Joe's full name, the guy that interviewed me?
[01:40:04.981 --> 01:40:06.583]  He's our correspondent, Joe John.
[01:40:07.892 --> 01:40:22.795]  Well, I wanted to be clear, because I got cut off right there at the end, when I was saying protect ourselves from CNN scum, I meant particularly those that helped promote the WMD hoax with the Bush administration in 2002-2003.
[01:40:22.795 --> 01:40:25.795]  I wasn't saying you're all bad or evil.
[01:40:25.795 --> 01:40:30.196]  I was just getting upset by the question over and over again, you know, are you causing the violence?
[01:40:30.196 --> 01:40:31.936]  Do you feel guilty for this?
[01:40:31.936 --> 01:40:36.357]  That was of, I mean, you can imagine all I call for is non-violence here.
[01:40:37.137 --> 01:40:41.540]  And so I've kind of gotten to the point where it's a pet peeve.
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:44.221]  Kind of rubs me the wrong way when that happens.
[01:40:44.221 --> 01:40:49.765]  Well, we have to ask you the question to give you the chance to state your position.
[01:40:49.765 --> 01:40:55.368]  So we're just trying to be fair and get your statement.
[01:40:55.368 --> 01:40:57.169]  Let me guess.
[01:40:57.169 --> 01:41:02.452]  The point about if redcoats come marching up your street firing at you, you have a right to defend yourself.
[01:41:02.452 --> 01:41:03.673]  Is that what's going to be on the news tonight?
[01:41:05.542 --> 01:41:09.344]  Um, no, that actually isn't one of the parts we used.
[01:41:09.344 --> 01:41:12.145]  It was pretty close.
[01:41:12.145 --> 01:41:17.507]  I think we used part of that answer, but not that, um... Oh, you used the Malcolm X part?
[01:41:17.507 --> 01:41:27.170]  No, I think the part about, um... Oh, I mean, you're catching me without the script in front of me, and of course, Friday seems like a long way away.
[01:41:27.170 --> 01:41:28.811]  I shouldn't try and...
[01:41:29.418 --> 01:41:32.181]  Well, then the best thing I can do is suggest you watch the show tonight.
[01:41:50.494 --> 01:41:55.218]  So, I saw some web comments that people were contacting CNN.
[01:41:55.218 --> 01:42:01.382]  Just to be clear though, you're a CNN producer, and I did not hoax the fact that you guys interviewed me.
[01:42:01.382 --> 01:42:02.162]  Absolutely not.
[01:42:02.162 --> 01:42:06.405]  We came to you and wanted to interview you for our story.
[01:42:06.405 --> 01:42:17.072]  Alright, well, so you think it's going to air tonight, and let me guess, I'll be mixed in with the Beverly Hillbillies that the feds set up up there in Michigan.
[01:42:17.072 --> 01:42:18.113]  Not in this piece, no.
[01:42:18.624 --> 01:42:19.146]  Oh really?
[01:42:19.146 --> 01:42:24.220]  Wow, well I'm... So is this just mainly about the tea parties then?
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:26.988]  No, it's really about you and various members of Congress.
[01:42:29.173 --> 01:42:38.835]  And of course, the bottom line there is, I guess you guys are setting the parameters of debate, saying, you know, does it add credence to the radicals that congressmen come on this radio show?
[01:42:38.835 --> 01:42:39.636]  Is this dangerous?
[01:42:39.636 --> 01:42:51.038]  I mean, are you guys kind of like the grand gatekeepers that are gonna... Because I've seen other pieces on Fox and CNN where they've attacked Gohmert and others for coming on my show.
[01:42:51.038 --> 01:42:53.659]  You did contact Gohmert and Ron Paul for this piece, didn't you?
[01:42:55.728 --> 01:43:02.733]  Yes, Ron Paul, we saw him briefly and he said he didn't have time to talk to us about it.
[01:43:02.733 --> 01:43:03.333]  And what was it?
[01:43:03.333 --> 01:43:06.155]  Why are you going on the radical Alex Jones Show?
[01:43:06.155 --> 01:43:09.597]  Is that what you were asking?
[01:43:09.597 --> 01:43:14.800]  No, I don't think that's quite how we put it.
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:17.382]  But no, I don't think we're trying to set any parameters.
[01:43:17.382 --> 01:43:24.086]  I think actually our story, what we're trying to do is ask the question about what the parameters should be.
[01:43:26.553 --> 01:43:30.475]  You know, though, Justine, this could be all staged as well.
[01:43:30.475 --> 01:43:33.817]  Maybe you're not really a CNN producer.
[01:43:33.817 --> 01:43:34.157]  Maybe.
[01:43:34.157 --> 01:43:39.240]  Sometimes I wake up and I can't quite believe it myself.
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.360]  Well, you know, here's what's going on.
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:42.761]  I'll let you go because I know you're busy.
[01:43:42.761 --> 01:43:50.245]  See, I've been successful at waking people up because I do cover what I can prove, and my track record of predictions has been very accurate.
[01:43:50.245 --> 01:43:52.747]  Did you know that I actually interviewed
[01:43:53.735 --> 01:43:59.697]  One of the leaders of the militia, Pale Horse.
[01:43:59.697 --> 01:44:01.977]  His real name is Sickles.
[01:44:01.977 --> 01:44:03.217]  In fact, I'm looking for that.
[01:44:03.217 --> 01:44:04.578]  No, I didn't know that.
[01:44:04.578 --> 01:44:05.618]  How did that go?
[01:44:05.618 --> 01:44:08.319]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:44:08.319 --> 01:44:11.239]  Well, it was back on August 17th of last year.
[01:44:11.239 --> 01:44:14.660]  In fact, guys, will you pull up Kurt Nemo's story about that?
[01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:17.581]  The strange case of Sickles.
[01:44:17.581 --> 01:44:21.802]  I predicted, I said, you guys are probably going to be set up with a fake
[01:44:23.751 --> 01:44:27.054]  Intel gathering operation against a police station.
[01:44:27.054 --> 01:44:34.158]  And the reason I knew that is that that's what the Feds always do, is they go in and radicalize militias and actually provocateur them.
[01:44:34.158 --> 01:44:40.262]  I mean, are you familiar with 1993 when the Feds cooked the bomb, drained the driver in the World Trade Center bombing?
[01:44:40.262 --> 01:44:42.544]  I'm familiar with the World Trade Center bombing, yes.
[01:44:42.544 --> 01:44:50.269]  But I mean, the New York Times article and the released audio tapes of the federal informant, Ahmad Salam, being ordered to build a real bomb and let it go forward?
[01:44:52.944 --> 01:44:57.045]  I'm not so sure I'm familiar with that.
[01:44:57.045 --> 01:45:03.828]  Well, here's the article, just in case you want to go pull the interview we did with Christopher Sickles.
[01:45:03.828 --> 01:45:05.268]  Are you familiar with his name?
[01:45:05.268 --> 01:45:07.049]  No.
[01:45:07.049 --> 01:45:12.351]  Well, he's supposedly one of the people rounded up in these militia and he's the pale horse.
[01:45:13.735 --> 01:45:28.705]  And of all the 400 plus militia groups, I said on air, I believe there's operatives in this group, maybe even the pale horse, and that they're going to be set up and that they will target police because that's what the feds want, is to create a perception that police are being targeted.
[01:45:28.705 --> 01:45:37.171]  So that they can then swing the Homeland Security apparatus around on the American people and say, oh look, the MIAC and Homeland Security reports, they're coming true.
[01:45:37.171 --> 01:45:41.313]  Well, it's coming true because this is being manufactured.
[01:45:41.313 --> 01:45:42.534]  Like Texas Monthly reported in 1998.
[01:45:46.232 --> 01:45:51.273]  Did you ever read that article about how they created a fake Klan group to try to get them to carry out terror attacks?
[01:45:51.273 --> 01:45:52.593]  The FBI?
[01:45:52.593 --> 01:45:54.954]  No, I don't think I saw that article.
[01:45:54.954 --> 01:45:57.374]  Okay, well listen, you've been very, very kind.
[01:45:57.374 --> 01:45:59.454]  What time in the show is this going to air or we don't know?
[01:45:59.454 --> 01:46:01.755]  Just 9 o'clock Central, 10 o'clock Eastern?
[01:46:01.755 --> 01:46:04.375]  That's right, yeah.
[01:46:04.375 --> 01:46:12.897]  And I wish I could guarantee that it will air because it's already been held up just because that's the nature of live news.
[01:46:12.897 --> 01:46:14.797]  But fingers crossed it'll be on tonight.
[01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:17.432]  If it doesn't air tonight, then it's not going to air?
[01:46:17.432 --> 01:46:20.074]  No, I wouldn't say that.
[01:46:20.074 --> 01:46:26.059]  Okay, well listen, thank you for speaking with us, and I appreciate Justine Redmond for talking to us from CNN.
[01:46:26.059 --> 01:46:27.560]  Alright, thank you.
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:29.041]  Take care.
[01:46:29.041 --> 01:46:31.523]  Okay, there you go ladies, and now it will just deepen.
[01:46:31.523 --> 01:46:34.326]  They'll say, that was not CNN, that's his wife!
[01:46:35.657 --> 01:46:37.537]  Because that's the conspiracy theorist.
[01:46:37.537 --> 01:46:39.098]  I'm Bill Hicks.
[01:46:39.098 --> 01:46:41.098]  I'm a reptoid.
[01:46:41.098 --> 01:46:42.198]  I work for the Vatican.
[01:46:42.198 --> 01:46:43.198]  I work for Israel.
[01:46:43.198 --> 01:46:44.179]  I'm a Scientologist.
[01:46:44.179 --> 01:46:46.179]  No, I'm none of those things.
[01:46:46.179 --> 01:46:50.040]  I'm a red-blooded American and a Texan who's defending my republic.
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:55.281]  Okay, I got Peter Dale Scott come up and I said I'd take your calls.
[01:46:55.281 --> 01:46:58.821]  You know, I knew CNN probably wouldn't air it.
[01:46:58.821 --> 01:47:00.622]  And it remains to be seen if they will.
[01:47:00.622 --> 01:47:02.422]  So I thought, we're in a hurry.
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:05.701]  Most of the other guys had to leave.
[01:47:05.701 --> 01:47:06.421]  It was Friday.
[01:47:06.421 --> 01:47:08.663]  They wanted to go cash their checks.
[01:47:08.663 --> 01:47:11.405]  And Craig, who's not really one of our camera guys, I said, can you come with me?
[01:47:11.405 --> 01:47:13.226]  And he said, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:13.226 --> 01:47:14.907]  I've got to go engineer for a band tonight.
[01:47:14.907 --> 01:47:15.448]  He does that in his...
[01:47:16.650 --> 01:47:17.010]  Part-time.
[01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:18.411]  He's a great engineer.
[01:47:18.411 --> 01:47:19.692]  Sound engineer.
[01:47:19.692 --> 01:47:25.476]  And so, uh, not his best camera work for a Friday, but he's like 15 feet away with a camera zoomed in.
[01:47:25.476 --> 01:47:26.857]  It's really hard because they shake.
[01:47:26.857 --> 01:47:29.059]  I mean, I'm a pretty good camera guy and it's hard.
[01:47:29.059 --> 01:47:35.263]  The point is, so we just thought we'd shoot it and show you, you know, at least it wouldn't be a waste of time driving downtown.
[01:47:35.263 --> 01:47:44.149]  And then that gets spun by COINTELPRO and operas because they don't want people to have a debate about the issues I put forward in that CNN interview.
[01:47:49.855 --> 01:47:56.358]  It's got over 200,000 views in the three different versions of the video I've seen just on YouTube alone.
[01:47:56.358 --> 01:48:00.941]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's a militia member here?
[01:48:00.941 --> 01:48:08.945]  Alright, we'll go to Kevin in Boston, then we're gonna go to Tim in Michigan who's got intel from the ground, Chris, Scotty, Dan, and others.
[01:48:08.945 --> 01:48:10.906]  Kevin, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:48:10.906 --> 01:48:13.387]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:48:13.387 --> 01:48:18.589]  When you asked for a call for a militia, I just wanted to point out Section 13 of the U.S.
[01:48:18.589 --> 01:48:19.230]  Code Title 10
[01:48:20.109 --> 01:48:23.330]  Is entitled, Militia Composition and its Classes.
[01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:33.413]  No, no, 18 to 45, and I know it's federal law that we're all in the militia, and that's why they're creating these ridiculous militias to make us look stupid.
[01:48:33.413 --> 01:48:40.154]  Well, that's it, but I don't want to make fun of, you know, I trust your investigation into these things, that's what you do.
[01:48:40.154 --> 01:48:46.496]  I don't want to, you know, call anyone else ridiculous, because I know that they can defame all of us.
[01:48:46.496 --> 01:48:49.197]  They're very effective at that, and I don't know who to believe and what to believe.
[01:48:49.804 --> 01:48:56.029]  Other than my own personal... Yeah, but I've interviewed members of this militia, and out of the 400 groups, I said, Red Alert!
[01:48:56.029 --> 01:48:57.010]  Dangerous group!
[01:48:57.010 --> 01:48:58.191]  Being shut up!
[01:48:58.191 --> 01:49:09.219]  I mean... I'm not trying to identify with them, I just think, you know, I worry about my own actions and my own things, so I'm not disagreeing with you, and I'm not affiliated with them in any way.
[01:49:09.219 --> 01:49:15.264]  I mean, I post on AWRM.org, and I would encourage people that are interested
[01:49:15.717 --> 01:49:26.722]  In the concept of the militia, not to go join any group, but to study leaderless resistance and to read the National Militia Standards, which can be found on awrm.org.
[01:49:26.722 --> 01:49:29.364]  Yes, I've had a provocateur attempt, I believe.
[01:49:29.364 --> 01:49:30.244]  I haven't proven that.
[01:49:30.244 --> 01:49:32.665]  I don't have the resources that you have to look at.
[01:49:32.665 --> 01:49:35.867]  I just disassociated and got myself out of a situation.
[01:49:35.867 --> 01:49:40.409]  But they're out there, and that's why it's much more effective.
[01:49:40.409 --> 01:49:42.030]  You know, things are going very well for us.
[01:49:42.874 --> 01:49:48.279]  There's 14 million guns sold in America, 14 billion rounds of ammunition in this past year.
[01:49:48.279 --> 01:49:51.101]  People need to better, you know, we are non-violent.
[01:49:51.101 --> 01:49:54.383]  These are, you know, only for defensive purposes.
[01:49:54.383 --> 01:50:03.251]  And what people really need to be doing is just doing what they're doing, getting the word out, waking everyone else up, being prepared by storing food for emergencies.
[01:50:03.251 --> 01:50:04.291]  It could be Katrina.
[01:50:04.291 --> 01:50:07.794]  It could be some of the floods we're experiencing up here in the Northeast right now.
[01:50:07.794 --> 01:50:10.376]  Being independent-minded is not a bad thing.
[01:50:10.376 --> 01:50:11.117]  We're not evil.
[01:50:11.744 --> 01:50:19.668]  And, um, you know, I just watched on Irish Catholic, I just watched the movie Michael Collins about the Irish Easter uprising that was just on again.
[01:50:19.668 --> 01:50:34.817]  And, you know, at the end of the movie, it seems sad if you're from Irish, if you're Irish Catholic and you're sympathetic to the Easter uprising when, um, first Michael Boland is killed and then Michael Collins is killed and they're on opposite ends of a civil war.
[01:50:34.817 --> 01:50:37.118]  But then as it closes, you remember,
[01:50:37.526 --> 01:50:47.856]  That look, they achieved their goal of a free republic and they made peace with England and ended a lot of the violence.
[01:50:47.856 --> 01:50:53.542]  We know this, if we don't stand up, tyrants will take over every time and have their way with us.
[01:50:53.542 --> 01:50:54.103]  God bless you.
[01:51:01.084 --> 01:51:04.286]  Times are tough and you gotta stretch that dollar.

[01:52:01.081 --> 01:52:02.381]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.381 --> 01:52:07.963]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.963 --> 01:52:12.984]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.984 --> 01:52:18.566]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:18.566 --> 01:52:23.227]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.786 --> 01:52:30.888]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.

[01:54:10.936 --> 01:54:14.137]  We've got a new t-shirt destined to be a bestseller.
[01:54:14.137 --> 01:54:18.638]  Look, Obama is a front man, a figurehead.
[01:54:18.638 --> 01:54:20.659]  They want to build him up and tear him down.
[01:54:20.659 --> 01:54:22.879]  But they want to tear him down later.
[01:54:22.879 --> 01:54:26.860]  We need to tear him down now so their agenda stalls.
[01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:28.701]  His real name is Barry Sotero.
[01:54:29.622 --> 01:54:33.725]  He became a national citizen of Indonesia.
[01:54:33.725 --> 01:54:35.187]  He was adopted.
[01:54:35.187 --> 01:54:39.330]  You then can't be natural born once you've given up your citizenship and come back.
[01:54:39.330 --> 01:54:41.152]  His real name is Barry Sitaro.
[01:54:41.152 --> 01:54:49.199]  Regardless of the birth certificate, and there's a lot of evidence that he was born in Kenya, he's not eligible to be president.
[01:54:49.199 --> 01:54:57.425]  Now we have a new t-shirt with a big picture of Barry Sitaro, and it says, where is the birth certificate?
[01:54:57.425 --> 01:54:57.706]  Under it.
[01:54:58.632 --> 01:54:59.693]  That's on the front.
[01:54:59.693 --> 01:55:01.414]  On the back, InfoWars.com.
[01:55:01.414 --> 01:55:03.776]  And people are going to stop you everywhere and say, Barry Sotero.
[01:55:03.776 --> 01:55:05.518]  And go, yeah, that's his real name.
[01:55:05.518 --> 01:55:09.120]  Didn't you know he even has a fake name?
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:13.684]  It's almost like the birth certificate is a distraction from this Indonesian citizenship.
[01:55:13.684 --> 01:55:16.406]  That's 100% confirmed.
[01:55:16.406 --> 01:55:20.229]  Boy, if the government wasn't mad at me before, they're really going to be mad now.
[01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:23.232]  Hey, at the point of no return a long time ago.
[01:55:23.232 --> 01:55:25.394]  Full steam ahead.
[01:55:25.394 --> 01:55:26.615]  What about that CNN call?
[01:55:26.615 --> 01:55:27.836]  The guys are all laughing at that.
[01:55:28.843 --> 01:55:33.327]  I can't believe these idiots were saying I faked a CNN interview.
[01:55:33.327 --> 01:55:34.808]  I made clear it was a taped interview.
[01:55:34.808 --> 01:55:36.029]  I don't know if they're going to air it.
[01:55:36.029 --> 01:55:38.150]  You heard her saying they don't know if they will.
[01:55:38.150 --> 01:55:39.391]  I don't know what that phone call will do.
[01:55:39.391 --> 01:55:41.593]  I don't even care about being their stupid piece tonight.
[01:55:41.593 --> 01:55:49.499]  But now I want it to air for all these idiots running around saying it's fake, it's not real!
[01:55:49.499 --> 01:55:50.000]  Unbelievable.
[01:55:50.874 --> 01:55:52.775]  Okay, that's enough of me ranting.
[01:55:52.775 --> 01:55:56.258]  You can get that new t-shirt and the two new films we've got out.
[01:55:56.258 --> 01:55:58.079]  Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:55:58.079 --> 01:56:02.642]  Look, everybody wants to know if FEMA camps are real, the COG, the martial law.
[01:56:02.642 --> 01:56:03.502]  This film proves it.
[01:56:03.502 --> 01:56:05.483]  Two hours, 20 plus minutes.
[01:56:05.483 --> 01:56:07.064]  Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:56:07.064 --> 01:56:08.405]  Incredibly powerful.
[01:56:08.405 --> 01:56:08.726]  Get it.
[01:56:08.726 --> 01:56:11.247]  Give it to everybody you know so they understand what's happening.
[01:56:11.247 --> 01:56:13.969]  We document the false flag terror, the provocateurs.
[01:56:13.969 --> 01:56:16.451]  Holly tried to set up my crew as terrorists in Pittsburgh.
[01:56:16.451 --> 01:56:18.312]  I mean, this is standard procedure.
[01:56:18.312 --> 01:56:20.053]  And they'll do it to you unless we expose them.
[01:56:21.101 --> 01:56:24.682]  It's like they've been caught framing people with fake DNA evidence now.
[01:56:24.682 --> 01:56:26.883]  They're trying to sell you that DNA is a great thing.
[01:56:26.883 --> 01:56:28.463]  No, it's not.
[01:56:28.463 --> 01:56:29.463]  DNA evidence.
[01:56:29.463 --> 01:56:30.984]  Let's go to Tim in Michigan.
[01:56:30.984 --> 01:56:33.784]  Thanks for holding her on the air, Tim.
[01:56:33.784 --> 01:56:34.705]  Hey, Alex.
[01:56:34.705 --> 01:56:36.045]  Hey, buddy.
[01:56:36.045 --> 01:56:39.126]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:56:39.126 --> 01:56:46.208]  Hey, listen, I'd like to first thank you for waking me up, although sometimes I don't know if I want to bless you or curse you.
[01:56:47.324 --> 01:57:01.631]  Because of, uh, you know, I realize this stuff's real and, uh, you know, I'm not, I don't want to say I'm paranoid, but, um, let's just say that, uh, I've been a 9-11 truther since about, uh, six, seven years ago when I started doing research on this.
[01:57:01.631 --> 01:57:07.393]  I was actually handed a DVD by some people, uh, that were 9-11 truthers in Florida.
[01:57:07.393 --> 01:57:11.695]  And that's how I kind of got turned on to the whole thing and, uh, did my own research.
[01:57:11.695 --> 01:57:13.376]  Nobody put anything in my head.
[01:57:13.376 --> 01:57:15.477]  I went and researched this myself.
[01:57:15.962 --> 01:57:28.866]  And like many others, I'm thoroughly convinced that, and now know that everything that you're telling us is basically for, you know, watch out for your own back because this stuff's for real.
[01:57:28.866 --> 01:57:31.147]  Now, this started Sunday.
[01:57:31.147 --> 01:57:43.711]  I've actually talked to Michigan Militia people, and I got a link off of one of your websites that went right to Michigan Militia Radio, and just out of curiosity I clicked on the hyperlink.
[01:57:44.421 --> 01:57:56.672]  And I started listening, and this is... I don't know how you want to do this, but I've actually kind of numerically categorized my information that I wanted to feed to you.
[01:57:56.672 --> 01:58:02.457]  So, do you want me to just dump it all out, or do you want to... Well, you're in Michigan.
[01:58:02.457 --> 01:58:03.398]  Just tell us.
[01:58:03.398 --> 01:58:05.020]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:05.620]  Okay.
[01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:08.042]  Well, this is what I found out from right here, and I...
[01:58:09.031 --> 01:58:14.516]  I live in Macomb County, which is maybe a 45-minute drive from where this all happened.
[01:58:14.516 --> 01:58:27.806]  Okay, so, anyway, Listen Radio is broadcasting that somebody blogged on their website that they had sealed warrants and indictments for new people.
[01:58:27.806 --> 01:58:29.728]  Now, I know this to be a fact, Alex.
[01:58:29.728 --> 01:58:31.890]  They rated Awake.
[01:58:31.890 --> 01:58:34.292]  This is what they rated, Awake.
[01:58:34.292 --> 01:58:34.672]  This was a

[02:00:23.433 --> 02:00:26.534]  We've now reached the halfway point in this worldwide broadcast.
[02:00:27.841 --> 02:00:30.983]  We're going to shift gears into a host of key issues here in a moment.
[02:00:30.983 --> 02:00:35.746]  In fact, will you guys print me for the Peter Del Scott interview, the two links I sent you yesterday?
[02:00:35.746 --> 02:00:44.031]  Headline, NATO says no to Russian plan to eradicate poppies, Reuters.
[02:00:44.031 --> 02:00:45.892]  Or it's a similar headline, I need that again.
[02:00:45.892 --> 02:00:48.413]  And I sent you another one.
[02:00:48.413 --> 02:00:49.334]  Oh, it's in the bio book.
[02:00:52.546 --> 02:00:53.046]  Okay, good.
[02:00:53.046 --> 02:00:56.188]  Yeah, NATO rejects Russian call for Afghan poppy spring.
[02:00:56.188 --> 02:01:09.175]  I sent you a couple other mainstream articles, too, where they just admit our government won't get rid of the poppies, and it's up over 12-fold the amount being shipped out of the country to Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, and the United States.
[02:01:10.228 --> 02:01:15.252]  Upwards of 90% of opium slash heroin production coming out of there.
[02:01:15.252 --> 02:01:17.074]  Okay, Tim, real fast.
[02:01:17.074 --> 02:01:22.178]  So, this was a wake that they raided, people are saying on the internet.
[02:01:22.178 --> 02:01:27.162]  I mean, specifically being there in Michigan, what other info do you have?
[02:01:27.162 --> 02:01:38.671]  Okay, anyway, what happened is, well, I talked to one of the guys, I was actually on one of their broadcasts last night, and later that day, it was still Sunday, right, the FBI had told
[02:01:39.184 --> 02:01:48.752]  Somebody at one of the, it's claiming to be Fox's blog on their website, that the reason these people were arrested were for making and selling pipe bombs.
[02:01:48.752 --> 02:02:03.785]  Now if these were sealed documents, and this was still Sunday, when this blog showed up on their website, if these were sealed documents, and this was Sunday, and they were to be open until Monday, okay, how did this blog end up on their website?
[02:02:04.488 --> 02:02:16.154]  Well I've seen, I've seen, I've seen on police footage, Ferrell Montgomery was one of the cases out in Phoenix.
[02:02:16.154 --> 02:02:20.537]  They got jumper cables out on the news from his RV and said, look, pipe bombs.
[02:02:20.537 --> 02:02:23.518]  They will say a can of gasoline is a pipe bomb.
[02:02:23.518 --> 02:02:25.580]  They will say a toothbrush is a pipe bomb.
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:28.061]  They will say a canary is a pipe bomb.
[02:02:28.061 --> 02:02:30.863]  They will say an Easter Bunny is a pipe bomb.
[02:02:30.863 --> 02:02:33.164]  And, you know, they'll just walk in your house, pick up a telephone and go,
[02:02:34.841 --> 02:02:37.162]  This is a pipe bomb.
[02:02:37.162 --> 02:02:38.123]  See this?
[02:02:38.123 --> 02:02:39.484]  This kills police.
[02:02:39.484 --> 02:02:45.067]  This is a... I mean, people have to understand, the police frame people out of hand.
[02:02:45.067 --> 02:02:52.531]  And that is very suspicious, and I had seen reports of that, that this was known a day before the indictment was even released.
[02:02:52.531 --> 02:02:58.334]  But, you know, that can happen, but we need to track down who exactly put this on the blog.
[02:02:58.334 --> 02:02:58.994]  Right, right.
[02:02:58.994 --> 02:03:01.155]  And then something about our local news.
[02:03:01.155 --> 02:03:02.676]  Now, check this out, and I quote,
[02:03:03.152 --> 02:03:13.100]  Local news are saying, of course, that just like he said, they plan to kill cops and then they were going to raid the funeral processions and attack more cops.
[02:03:13.715 --> 02:03:17.898]  And I quote, she said, with weapons of mass destruction.
[02:03:17.898 --> 02:03:20.060]  No, no, that's in the affidavit.
[02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:23.002]  See, now a gun is a weapon of mass destruction.
[02:03:23.002 --> 02:03:31.247]  First it was nukes, but now that they need to invade countries that they have guns, I guess a .22 handgun is a nuke now.
[02:03:31.247 --> 02:03:37.532]  And oh yes, they know the public's dumbed down, so it's just malicious, kill cops, WMDs.
[02:03:38.834 --> 02:03:46.117]  They wanted to attack a funeral possession, but you're saying that these people were all together at a wake, and that's what the cops actually raided?
[02:03:46.117 --> 02:03:48.198]  Yes, it was a wake.
[02:03:48.198 --> 02:03:54.660]  One of their fellow comrades, which Will had passed away, and they were gathered there at a wake.
[02:03:54.660 --> 02:03:58.502]  Now, I've got some other stuff that's going to really blow you out of your shoes here.
[02:03:58.502 --> 02:04:05.605]  They specifically, yesterday, were skating back.
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:08.482]  Um, they didn't use the term arraignment.
[02:04:08.482 --> 02:04:11.365]  They used the term detention hearing.
[02:04:11.365 --> 02:04:16.829]  And this is local news reporting from the Detroit Federal Courthouse.
[02:04:16.829 --> 02:04:19.392]  They didn't use the term that they will be arraigned.
[02:04:19.392 --> 02:04:21.854]  They said they are going to their detention hearing.
[02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:32.888]  They specifically called it a detention hearing, which is probably nothing more than preparation for us to get used to that kind of terminology, I would imagine, from what I can see what they're trying to do.
[02:04:32.888 --> 02:04:38.672]  Oh, they've got the belligerent act racing through the House and Senate where U.S.
[02:04:38.672 --> 02:04:40.194]  citizens can be grabbed.
[02:04:41.223 --> 02:04:46.827]  For any intelligence purposes and never be seen again, an enhanced interrogation can be used.
[02:04:46.827 --> 02:04:52.030]  Again, they sold the American people that the police state was for Al Qaeda.
[02:04:52.030 --> 02:04:54.552]  Now you're going to learn, no, it's for gun owners.
[02:04:54.552 --> 02:04:57.094]  It's for you!
[02:04:57.094 --> 02:04:58.595]  We'll be right back with Peter Del Scott.
[02:04:58.595 --> 02:04:59.035]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.865 --> 02:05:03.226]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:05:03.226 --> 02:05:05.567]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:05:05.567 --> 02:05:08.768]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:05:08.768 --> 02:05:13.869]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:05:13.869 --> 02:05:18.071]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:05:18.391 --> 02:05:20.734]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:05:20.734 --> 02:05:23.278]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:05:23.278 --> 02:05:26.542]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:05:26.542 --> 02:05:34.152]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:05:34.471 --> 02:05:39.856]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:05:39.856 --> 02:05:42.179]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:05:42.179 --> 02:05:46.403]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:05:46.403 --> 02:05:47.484]  And I got news for you.
[02:05:47.484 --> 02:05:48.805]  You're everyone else.
[02:05:48.805 --> 02:05:50.306]  Invisible Empire.

[02:06:00.748 --> 02:06:02.049]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:02.049 --> 02:06:07.632]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:06:07.632 --> 02:06:12.655]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:06:12.655 --> 02:06:17.678]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:06:18.218 --> 02:06:23.441]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:06:23.441 --> 02:06:25.762]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:06:25.762 --> 02:06:30.564]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:06:30.564 --> 02:06:31.685]  And here's the best part.
[02:06:31.685 --> 02:06:34.746]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:06:34.746 --> 02:06:38.028]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:06:38.348 --> 02:06:41.550]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:06:41.550 --> 02:06:43.771]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:06:43.771 --> 02:06:44.711]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:06:44.711 --> 02:06:45.031]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:06:45.031 --> 02:06:48.353]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:06:48.353 --> 02:06:50.074]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:07:00.499 --> 02:07:05.804]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[02:07:05.804 --> 02:07:08.566]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[02:07:08.566 --> 02:07:13.891]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:07:13.891 --> 02:07:18.375]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.
[02:07:18.375 --> 02:07:19.816]  We also have some specials for you.
[02:07:19.816 --> 02:07:21.477]  Some of our other films have price.
[02:07:21.477 --> 02:07:24.040]  When you order Shadow Government, a new level
[02:07:24.380 --> 02:07:24.780]  We're good.
[02:07:44.099 --> 02:07:45.700]  Shadow Government, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:45.700 --> 02:07:48.322]  Get your copy at InfoWars.com today.
[02:07:48.322 --> 02:07:49.723]  Shadow Government.
[02:07:49.723 --> 02:07:51.945]  It gives Big Brother a black eye.
[02:07:51.945 --> 02:08:02.752]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:02.752 --> 02:08:09.397]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.397 --> 02:08:12.379]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:14.448 --> 02:08:17.030]  By the way, you know, I plugged this at the end of the last hour.
[02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:19.191]  I'm going to plug it again right now.
[02:08:19.191 --> 02:08:24.075]  We've got a t-shirt that I believe is destined to be one of the hottest sellers ever.
[02:08:24.075 --> 02:08:27.597]  Barry Sotaro, where is the birth certificate?
[02:08:27.597 --> 02:08:29.919]  It's got a picture, his official presidential photo.
[02:08:31.616 --> 02:08:39.423]  With the name Barry Sitaro, his real name, and under it, where is the birth certificate, and on the back of the white t-shirt, Infowars.com.
[02:08:39.423 --> 02:08:41.345]  You can be a walking, talking billboard.
[02:08:41.345 --> 02:08:43.587]  People say, Barry Sitaro?
[02:08:43.587 --> 02:08:45.269]  Yeah, that's his real name.
[02:08:45.269 --> 02:08:45.869]  Don't believe me?
[02:08:45.869 --> 02:08:48.312]  Just go Google it, and you'll see mainstream news,
[02:08:49.417 --> 02:08:53.821]  London Telegraph, Associated Press, but they would deny this during the campaign.
[02:08:53.821 --> 02:08:57.104]  He is actually an Indonesian citizen, gave up his U.S.
[02:08:57.104 --> 02:09:05.152]  citizenship, was adopted, that means he's ineligible to be president, obviously he's born in Kenya, the evidence is overwhelming, but you can't 100% prove that.
[02:09:05.152 --> 02:09:06.353]  You can 100% prove federal law
[02:09:10.236 --> 02:09:12.577]  That you cannot have a dual citizenship with Indonesia.
[02:09:12.577 --> 02:09:17.139]  At the time he did that, he is not eligible to be President of the United States.
[02:09:17.139 --> 02:09:23.062]  And it's illegal to be passing the government takeover of healthcare.
[02:09:23.062 --> 02:09:27.044]  It's illegal to be expanding the Patriot Act.
[02:09:27.044 --> 02:09:30.266]  All of this, to hire nothing but lobbyists.
[02:09:30.266 --> 02:09:39.751]  But if you can get Al Capone on insurance or tax evasion, why not get this Al Capone for the fact that he's really Barry Sotero?
[02:09:41.224 --> 02:09:46.070]  And everybody needs to get this shirt and wear it at the Tea Party events.
[02:09:46.070 --> 02:09:48.012]  It'll be very, very popular, let me tell you.
[02:09:48.012 --> 02:09:55.841]  All right, I'm going to stop here in just a moment.
[02:09:55.841 --> 02:09:58.364]  We may have had a time zone issue with Peter Dale Scott.
[02:09:59.926 --> 02:10:02.827]  But it's not a big deal.
[02:10:02.827 --> 02:10:06.008]  We'll get him on the next few days, or you probably think he's on next hour.
[02:10:06.008 --> 02:10:07.048]  Webster Tarpley's on.
[02:10:07.048 --> 02:10:09.349]  I want to get him on about this malicious situation.
[02:10:09.349 --> 02:10:11.189]  I have no idea what his opinion is.
[02:10:11.189 --> 02:10:12.670]  I disrespect his opinion.
[02:10:12.670 --> 02:10:14.370]  Doesn't mean I'll totally agree with what he has to say.
[02:10:14.370 --> 02:10:17.371]  I don't know what he's going to say, because I'm the real expert on this subject.
[02:10:17.371 --> 02:10:22.833]  I mean, I really have studied it and been in the middle of it for 14 years.
[02:10:22.833 --> 02:10:26.854]  But he'll probably see it as a provocateur and false flag event.
[02:10:28.373 --> 02:10:30.275]  Because I know he'll see some of the same indicators I've seen.
[02:10:30.275 --> 02:10:33.918]  I want to get his take on the Moscow situation.
[02:10:33.918 --> 02:10:39.843]  I mean, Paul Watson wrote an article saying, well, FSB's been tied to staging events, attacks against themselves before.
[02:10:39.843 --> 02:10:41.604]  This could be Russia.
[02:10:41.604 --> 02:10:43.226]  Tarpley may have a different view.
[02:10:43.226 --> 02:10:47.930]  I don't know, but Dr. Tarpley, we always enjoy his analysis.
[02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:51.513]  And so, we'll get his take on that coming up.
[02:10:51.513 --> 02:10:54.315]  But right now, let's continue with your phone calls.
[02:10:54.315 --> 02:10:55.636]  Let's talk to Chris in Jersey.
[02:10:55.636 --> 02:10:56.397]  You're on the air, Chris.
[02:10:58.413 --> 02:11:00.134]  I've gone out on a first-time caller.
[02:11:00.134 --> 02:11:05.697]  I've been listening to you since back in 2000 when I was stationed at Fort Hood, Texas.
[02:11:05.697 --> 02:11:14.141]  I used to listen to you on shortwave, and I used to, like, listen to you whenever I was in an active-duty military stationed over there, and now I live in Jersey.
[02:11:14.141 --> 02:11:14.841]  I'm a schoolteacher.
[02:11:14.841 --> 02:11:18.163]  I'm a military veteran, and it's an honor to talk to you, Alex.
[02:11:18.993 --> 02:11:20.314]  Well, it's an honor to talk to you.
[02:11:20.314 --> 02:11:21.374]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:11:21.374 --> 02:11:22.614]  Let me ask this question.
[02:11:22.614 --> 02:11:29.597]  Well, make your point, and I want to ask you, if you've been a longtime listener, I mean, have we not, I'm not bragging.
[02:11:29.597 --> 02:11:31.918]  I want people to take this serious, what we're doing here.
[02:11:31.918 --> 02:11:36.460]  Have we not called everything as it happens before it happens?
[02:11:36.460 --> 02:11:37.580]  Oh, for sure.
[02:11:37.580 --> 02:11:38.681]  And again, here's my point.
[02:11:38.681 --> 02:11:44.103]  There's no doubt that you are on the money with your analysis, because you know exactly what they're doing.
[02:11:44.103 --> 02:11:47.124]  And you are not full of, you know what, you are precise.
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:50.081]  You know that CNN call you just did with their producer?
[02:11:50.081 --> 02:11:52.682]  They're doing a piece on you.
[02:11:52.682 --> 02:12:05.206]  So I guarantee you that they recorded that phone call and they're going to be using clips of that phone call that you made because the whole point is to kind of like, um, denounce you or to make you look irrational or irrelevant.
[02:12:05.206 --> 02:12:08.287]  So I guarantee that phone call that you used is also going to appear on the piece.
[02:12:09.042 --> 02:12:17.065]  So it's going to be almost impossible for anybody to deny that you staged that CNN piece, whenever they also use your phone call that you did on air today.
[02:12:17.065 --> 02:12:20.366]  But just be aware of that, Alex, that they're definitely going to be using that phone call.
[02:12:20.366 --> 02:12:21.847]  I'd watch out for that.
[02:12:21.847 --> 02:12:26.509]  You know, I thought about that while it was happening, but I mean, that's OK.
[02:12:26.509 --> 02:12:28.730]  It's more important in case we don't air it that people...
[02:12:31.004 --> 02:12:32.105]  But then people won't even care.
[02:12:32.105 --> 02:12:34.186]  They'll say that isn't a real phone call.
[02:12:34.186 --> 02:12:37.288]  It's like they say Genesis is owned by some Saudi Arabian.
[02:12:37.288 --> 02:12:41.290]  Anybody could go look at the corporate documents of Genesis Communications in Minnesota.
[02:12:41.290 --> 02:12:42.691]  It's owned by Ted Anderson.
[02:12:42.691 --> 02:12:43.431]  But they don't care.
[02:12:43.431 --> 02:12:45.412]  They just make stuff up.
[02:12:45.412 --> 02:12:50.135]  And so, I probably shouldn't even have responded, but I thought it was fun.
[02:12:50.135 --> 02:12:54.117]  And it's informative radio to call up and, you know, talk to the CNN people.
[02:12:55.137 --> 02:13:02.122]  My degree is in psychology, and just my quick analysis there is I think you put too much credibility into what people that don't believe you say.
[02:13:02.122 --> 02:13:06.805]  Don't worry about what they're saying and them denouncing you and you having to prove yourself to them.
[02:13:06.805 --> 02:13:07.785]  You know that you're in the right.
[02:13:07.785 --> 02:13:08.966]  You know that you're strong.
[02:13:08.966 --> 02:13:18.773]  Stop wasting your energy and your time on these nutty people, conspiracy theorists, which leads me to my last point, that language is the parameters of our subconscious ego.
[02:13:18.773 --> 02:13:23.796]  They have already defined the words terrorist, conspiracy theory, and words like that.
[02:13:24.397 --> 02:13:26.198]  They already got those terms.
[02:13:26.198 --> 02:13:29.059]  I think that we need a new term.
[02:13:29.059 --> 02:13:31.219]  And this is a million dollar term, Alex.
[02:13:31.219 --> 02:13:34.140]  And I know you kind of struggle to define yourself when they ask you.
[02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:37.141]  You kind of sound like a constitutional conservative libertarian.
[02:13:37.141 --> 02:13:41.943]  But I think that the term that we need to start using is truth patriot.
[02:13:41.943 --> 02:13:44.343]  How can you not be for the truth?
[02:13:44.343 --> 02:13:52.186]  And it also kind of plays off on the fact that mainstream media spins things and they sell us on disinfo.
[02:13:52.728 --> 02:14:00.034]  So to be the truth patriot also highlights what the mainstream media is doing the opposite of, and also brings to the fact that they divide and conquer us.
[02:14:00.034 --> 02:14:03.637]  That we're patriotic to the truth, not to one party.
[02:14:03.637 --> 02:14:10.622]  We know about the left-right paradigm, that we are truthful or patriotic to the truth.
[02:14:10.622 --> 02:14:11.503]  What do you think about that?
[02:14:11.503 --> 02:14:13.824]  Well, I've made a similar point many times.
[02:14:15.273 --> 02:14:24.815]  I'm a freedom lover and I'm into the truth and I don't sit here and look at a news article and say, how should I cover this?
[02:14:24.815 --> 02:14:28.116]  What will people like?
[02:14:28.116 --> 02:14:29.576]  I just tell the truth.
[02:14:29.576 --> 02:14:40.439]  I just break down my knowledge, the research I've done, my larger understanding in context with whatever legislation we're covering or whatever news event we're covering.
[02:14:42.526 --> 02:14:48.128]  And that's all I've got is the fact that I am someone who has integrity.
[02:14:48.128 --> 02:14:51.329]  Go ahead.
[02:14:51.329 --> 02:14:52.769]  JFK piece, you know.
[02:14:52.769 --> 02:14:58.731]  I've been doing a lot of investigation into JFK, and I think that's really a turning point where the New World Order made their run for America.
[02:14:58.731 --> 02:15:01.432]  So, you know, I wanted to get an update on that from you.
[02:15:01.432 --> 02:15:06.373]  And finally, the last thing I have for you is 9-11 is a powerful number.
[02:15:06.373 --> 02:15:09.834]  9-11 is the number that we call because we need help.
[02:15:10.410 --> 02:15:14.052]  A number we call for safety because we can't provide safety for ourselves.
[02:15:14.052 --> 02:15:15.132]  It's an S.O.S.
[02:15:15.132 --> 02:15:16.333]  call.
[02:15:16.333 --> 02:15:17.133]  It's an S.O.S.
[02:15:17.133 --> 02:15:18.554]  call and it has double meaning.
[02:15:18.554 --> 02:15:20.995]  The government's saying, this is our number.
[02:15:20.995 --> 02:15:22.535]  We did this.
[02:15:22.535 --> 02:15:23.916]  But it's hidden in plain view.
[02:15:23.916 --> 02:15:27.978]  But for the weak minded it's, oh 9-11 you call us.
[02:15:27.978 --> 02:15:29.999]  This is when the government takes over.
[02:15:29.999 --> 02:15:34.441]  And they were on TV within minutes of the attack saying, the world has changed.
[02:15:34.441 --> 02:15:36.342]  We're going to take your rights away.
[02:15:36.342 --> 02:15:37.602]  This is the new world order.
[02:15:37.602 --> 02:15:38.763]  It was all scripted.
[02:15:38.763 --> 02:15:39.083]  Go ahead.
[02:15:39.767 --> 02:15:52.397]  And I said in 1991, George Bush mentioned the New World Order, 2001, on 9-11, the attack happened, so just beware of, they like the number 9-11, and 10-year increments, so, you know, we're coming up to 2011.
[02:15:52.397 --> 02:16:07.448]  I'd watch out for 9-11, 2011, you know, I'm just saying that that's their pattern, and I picked up on that pattern, and they used the term 9-11, but, you know, just to leave you on this note, Alex, don't put so much energy into the people that are denouncing you, and don't have to prove yourself to them.
[02:16:07.881 --> 02:16:12.484]  You know you're strong, you know that you're telling the truth, and stick with that, Alex.
[02:16:12.484 --> 02:16:15.527]  I've been listening to you for ten years and you're wasting too much energy.
[02:16:15.527 --> 02:16:17.228]  These people are holding you down.
[02:16:17.228 --> 02:16:21.651]  You need to step it up, and you need to keep strong, and you are the man, alright?
[02:16:21.651 --> 02:16:26.775]  Do not listen to these people trying to denounce you, and don't lower yourself to their level.
[02:16:26.775 --> 02:16:29.357]  You are the true patriot.
[02:16:29.357 --> 02:16:34.421]  God bless you, Chris, and so are all our great listeners that are out there taking action.
[02:16:34.421 --> 02:16:35.701]  I don't spend much time
[02:16:36.687 --> 02:16:43.550]  I don't even spend much time paying attention to people that are attacking me and lying about me.
[02:16:43.550 --> 02:16:53.173]  But if... This is the thought process that went into calling CNN back on air.
[02:16:53.173 --> 02:16:54.214]  They interview me Friday.
[02:16:54.214 --> 02:16:56.554]  They say it's airing that night.
[02:16:56.554 --> 02:16:58.835]  It doesn't air.
[02:16:58.835 --> 02:17:05.718]  And so I'm out there during a break and I think, you know, I ought to call them.
[02:17:07.534 --> 02:17:09.982]  But then I go, oh, that's not much time to talk during a break.
[02:17:09.982 --> 02:17:13.312]  To find out if it's ever going to air, why don't I just do it on air?
[02:17:14.209 --> 02:17:22.532]  And then I think, yeah, I'm definitely going to do that because it'll be funny for all the people that are saying I made up that I was interviewed by CNN.
[02:17:22.532 --> 02:17:25.973]  So that's the thought process that went into it.
[02:17:25.973 --> 02:17:33.956]  But I think it's important sometimes to cover COINTELPRO and how people try to pull real leaders down.
[02:17:33.956 --> 02:17:38.918]  Because when I'm being attacked, they're not attacking Alex Jones to get at Alex Jones.
[02:17:38.918 --> 02:17:39.978]  They know I'm not going to stop.
[02:17:39.978 --> 02:17:41.819]  They know my psychological makeup.
[02:17:43.092 --> 02:18:02.424]  They are doing that so new people that we've woken up, that you've woken up, start investigating and just see all the crud and all the disinformation and all the propaganda and then just get disillusioned.
[02:18:02.424 --> 02:18:06.086]  And so, but it is a distraction.
[02:18:06.086 --> 02:18:09.188]  I mean, when callers call in, you know, here and
[02:18:11.263 --> 02:18:16.746]  Alex, I know you're a good guy, or you need to answer this question.
[02:18:16.746 --> 02:18:28.013]  That's all a distraction at the end of the day, because I'm not running the government, I'm not running the country, regardless of whether I'm a good guy or a bad guy, and I'm a good guy.
[02:18:28.013 --> 02:18:36.437]  It's a distraction from, they're openly announcing they're going to take the public and private pension funds and give it to the private banks and take your money.
[02:18:36.437 --> 02:18:37.438]  Bloomberg.
[02:18:37.438 --> 02:18:38.699]  Business Week.
[02:18:38.699 --> 02:18:39.419]  World Net Daily.
[02:18:41.408 --> 02:18:55.774]  They're openly announcing they want to launch new wars.
[02:18:55.774 --> 02:18:56.474]  Fox News.
[02:18:58.191 --> 02:19:03.395]  Military husband probed for allegedly posting threats on radical websites.
[02:19:03.395 --> 02:19:12.562]  The man writing under the name ACA posted a comment last week in response to a story on the expanding role of the IRS under the new health care law.
[02:19:12.562 --> 02:19:19.868]  The story was posted on InfoWars.com, which is operated by conservative talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:19:21.308 --> 02:19:24.690]  So they imply there that I posted this guy's story.
[02:19:24.690 --> 02:19:28.452]  And this guy was calling up here yesterday going, look, I work for military security.
[02:19:28.452 --> 02:19:31.034]  My wife's a nurse.
[02:19:31.034 --> 02:19:33.956]  The FBI and Secret Service are here tearing through everything.
[02:19:33.956 --> 02:19:36.537]  I didn't post this stuff.
[02:19:36.537 --> 02:19:39.839]  And I'm like, well, buddy?
[02:19:39.839 --> 02:19:41.140]  You know?
[02:19:41.140 --> 02:19:44.942]  And the comments we saw were pretty tame compared to some of the things.
[02:19:44.942 --> 02:19:47.964]  And it was posting his address and where he lived.
[02:19:47.964 --> 02:19:49.245]  He probably is being set up.
[02:19:50.373 --> 02:19:58.477]  But see, this is all being done so they can associate it with me and associate it with my website.
[02:19:58.477 --> 02:20:01.338]  What is this, like the fifth or sixth time this has happened?
[02:20:01.338 --> 02:20:03.960]  The healing revolution is here, naturally.
[02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:06.641]  Announcing King Bio Natural Medicines.
[02:20:06.641 --> 02:20:11.683]  Over 200 powerful physician-tested homeopathic formulas for mind, body, and pets.

[02:20:24.853 --> 02:20:27.335]  That's KingBio.com.
[02:20:27.335 --> 02:20:28.536]  KingBio.com.
[02:20:28.536 --> 02:20:30.558]  Your natural pharmaceutical company.
[02:20:30.558 --> 02:20:31.859]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:31.859 --> 02:20:36.223]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock brokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:20:36.423 --> 02:20:36.944]  Thanks for watching!
[02:21:00.843 --> 02:21:10.872]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:21:10.872 --> 02:21:17.317]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[02:21:17.317 --> 02:21:26.165]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:21:26.545 --> 02:21:35.730]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:21:35.730 --> 02:21:40.593]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[02:21:40.593 --> 02:21:42.134]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:42.134 --> 02:21:44.635]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[02:21:44.915 --> 02:21:48.240]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:52.425]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[02:21:52.425 --> 02:21:53.307]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.307 --> 02:21:53.667]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.777 --> 02:22:03.099]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:22:03.099 --> 02:22:05.480]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:08.682]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:08.682 --> 02:22:13.785]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:13.785 --> 02:22:17.988]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:18.308 --> 02:22:20.771]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:20.771 --> 02:22:23.533]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:23.533 --> 02:22:26.456]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:26.456 --> 02:22:34.044]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:34.384 --> 02:22:39.766]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:39.766 --> 02:22:42.086]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:42.086 --> 02:22:46.307]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:46.307 --> 02:22:47.388]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:47.388 --> 02:22:48.728]  You're everyone else.
[02:22:48.728 --> 02:22:50.229]  Invisible Empire.

[02:23:00.532 --> 02:23:04.075]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:23:04.075 --> 02:23:06.357]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:23:06.357 --> 02:23:07.238]  Don't!
[02:23:07.238 --> 02:23:10.681]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:23:10.681 --> 02:23:17.806]  Why pay, when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:23:17.786 --> 02:23:19.768]  's number one debt secret.
[02:23:19.768 --> 02:23:23.852]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:23:23.852 --> 02:23:26.554]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:23:26.974 --> 02:23:34.337]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:23:34.337 --> 02:23:35.537]  Herb K was right.
[02:23:35.537 --> 02:23:38.739]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:23:38.739 --> 02:23:40.159]  What have you got to lose?
[02:23:40.159 --> 02:23:41.440]  Stop the calls now.
[02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:43.460]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[02:23:43.460 --> 02:23:47.342]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[02:23:47.342 --> 02:23:48.002]  Call 800-822-1291.
[02:23:48.002 --> 02:23:48.182]  That's 800-822-1291.
[02:23:56.295 --> 02:23:57.915]  800-822-1291.
[02:23:57.915 --> 02:24:21.399]  There is always hundreds of thousands of comments, conservatively, a day on YouTube, Google, Yahoo, and thousands of other sites, calling for violence, naming names.
[02:24:21.399 --> 02:24:23.860]  And we have a few moderators that if they see anything violent,
[02:24:24.861 --> 02:24:26.782]  They erase it.
[02:24:26.782 --> 02:24:38.551]  And this guy called up the office yesterday, and he talked to one of the customer service people, and they said he works for NSA, but they misunderstood.
[02:24:38.551 --> 02:24:41.373]  When I talked to him, he worked for base security, he said.
[02:24:41.373 --> 02:24:46.377]  Or I didn't talk to some of the other guys, didn't they relate it?
[02:24:46.377 --> 02:24:49.239]  And he was saying, this isn't me.
[02:24:51.474 --> 02:24:53.616]  I'm not the one that did this.
[02:24:53.616 --> 02:24:56.278]  Will you send me the IP addresses?
[02:24:56.278 --> 02:25:09.607]  And my customers heard, people said, no, we don't share IP addresses, but we went and looked it up, and it was a wireless card out of Kansas.
[02:25:09.607 --> 02:25:11.428]  And I don't know if this is his wireless card or not.
[02:25:11.428 --> 02:25:12.749]  He's saying he's being set up.
[02:25:12.749 --> 02:25:19.094]  I mean, why would he go post threats and then put his address and name and where he is on InfoWars.com?
[02:25:21.050 --> 02:25:25.894]  And this happened over the weekend.
[02:25:25.894 --> 02:25:30.257]  And you read this Fox News piece, it basically implies it's all my fault.
[02:25:30.257 --> 02:25:35.141]  And here's another one.
[02:25:35.141 --> 02:25:40.385]  The Hotari Militia, Michigan Militia, Lone Wolves and Alex Jones New World Order.
[02:25:40.385 --> 02:25:42.567]  And it basically says it's all my fault.
[02:25:42.567 --> 02:25:44.848]  Here is Fox News.
[02:25:44.848 --> 02:25:49.352]  Military husband probed for allegedly posting threats on radical website.
[02:25:49.352 --> 02:25:50.513]  Radical website.
[02:25:51.073 --> 02:25:54.134]  I mean, the demonization is in just full swing.
[02:25:54.134 --> 02:26:04.538]  And they just go picking through this stuff, finding anything they can to then imply... And again, that's the talking point from the ADL and Southern Property Law Center for a year now.
[02:26:04.538 --> 02:26:09.700]  And now there's a special about me, right on time, on Anderson Cooper tonight.
[02:26:09.700 --> 02:26:13.281]  But you heard the producer saying it probably is going to air, they don't know.
[02:26:13.281 --> 02:26:17.103]  I mean, CNN is making specials about Alex Jones?
[02:26:22.185 --> 02:26:27.488]  And I'll tell you, we're as clean as a whistle around here, but these people don't care.
[02:26:27.488 --> 02:26:38.454]  They already tried to set my cameraman up as terrorist last year in Pittsburgh for just walking up saying, hi, can we talk to your spokesperson please about the troops on the streets?
[02:26:38.454 --> 02:26:39.515]  Yeah, go over there and wait.
[02:26:39.515 --> 02:26:42.956]  And they get a car, pulls up, they say, leave.
[02:26:42.956 --> 02:26:47.479]  And the car follows them and the police come and say they're terrorists.
[02:26:49.005 --> 02:26:54.171]  The base says you ran, you were sneaking around the fence.
[02:26:54.171 --> 02:27:00.478]  Military husband probed for allegedly posting threats on radical website Fox News.
[02:27:00.478 --> 02:27:02.780]  And why are they coming after me trying to discredit me right now?
[02:27:02.780 --> 02:27:07.686]  Because they know that I know they're getting ready to stage a bunch of terror attacks to be blamed on the Tea Party.
[02:27:07.686 --> 02:27:09.087]  And all you Tea Party people
[02:27:10.151 --> 02:27:14.313]  You better get ready for this and when it happens you better come out and explain it's false flag.
[02:27:14.313 --> 02:27:16.594]  I know Michael Savage understands it.
[02:27:16.594 --> 02:27:20.236]  That's why for almost a year I've been playing his prediction that dovetails with mine.
[02:27:20.236 --> 02:27:23.677]  In fact, cue that back up for the next segment.
[02:27:23.677 --> 02:27:32.842]  The husband of a military service woman living on a Tennessee naval base is under investigation for posting threatening comments on a radical right-wing website foxnews.com has learned.
[02:27:33.803 --> 02:27:40.810]  The husband of a military servicewoman living in a Tennessee naval base is under investigation for posting threatening comments on a radical right-wing website.
[02:27:40.810 --> 02:27:42.672]  FoxNews.com has learned.
[02:27:42.672 --> 02:27:54.024]  Investigators with the Naval Criminal Investigative Services have seized the man's shotgun and taken it into the armory at the Naval Support Activity Mid-South based in Middleton, Tennessee.
[02:27:54.024 --> 02:27:56.887]  The firearm will be stored there while the agency's probe
[02:27:58.168 --> 02:27:59.629]  Continues.
[02:27:59.629 --> 02:28:06.716]  Well, he's saying he didn't do this, and who would go say their name and their address?
[02:28:06.716 --> 02:28:11.940]  Looks like a frame-up on the surface, doesn't it?
[02:28:11.940 --> 02:28:16.364]  The man, and then now the article just says he's guilty.
[02:28:16.364 --> 02:28:19.206]  He's denying it, they don't say that here, and then they just say he did it.
[02:28:20.031 --> 02:28:21.874]  This is the new journalism.
[02:28:21.874 --> 02:28:30.069]  The man writing under the name ACA posted a comment last week in response to a story on the expanding role of IRS under the new health care law.
[02:28:30.069 --> 02:28:32.513]  The story was posted on InfoWars.com.
[02:28:35.353 --> 02:28:40.377]  So that implies for the weak-minded that I posted his story, not that it's a comment.
[02:28:40.377 --> 02:28:43.179]  Which is operated by conservative talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:28:43.179 --> 02:28:46.041]  Not constitutionalist, not truth teller.
[02:28:46.041 --> 02:28:48.223]  When I was bashing Bush, I was a commie.
[02:28:48.223 --> 02:28:50.024]  Now I'm bashing Obama, I'm a right-winger.
[02:28:50.024 --> 02:28:52.126]  No, I'm a truth teller.
[02:28:52.126 --> 02:28:53.907]  We just tell the truth.
[02:28:53.907 --> 02:29:00.272]  In response to comments made by a poster who questioned others' comments and commitment to violence against government workers, ACA wrote,
[02:29:01.377 --> 02:29:02.038]  Then I will.
[02:29:02.038 --> 02:29:04.941]  I hereby threaten you with violence.
[02:29:04.941 --> 02:29:08.626]  They even use the legalese to get somebody in trouble.
[02:29:08.626 --> 02:29:09.547]  That's the benchmark.
[02:29:11.135 --> 02:29:18.080]  So he says, I declare that I will, I have by their end, threaten you with violence.
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:23.264]  If you come to my door, a dress removed, because that was in the post, see if I'm joking.
[02:29:23.264 --> 02:29:27.887]  And as for you, Ben, what does it look like you're living in right now?
[02:29:27.887 --> 02:29:30.809]  Ivan, go buy a gun, get some practice in.
[02:29:30.809 --> 02:29:34.672]  I'm going to finish up with this because it gets really bad here.
[02:29:34.672 --> 02:29:37.214]  I shouldn't laugh about all this, but it's like gallows humor.
[02:29:43.402 --> 02:29:45.203]  It's insane.
[02:29:45.203 --> 02:29:47.804]  It's totally insane what is going on.
[02:29:47.804 --> 02:29:48.565]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:48.565 --> 02:29:51.426]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.426 --> 02:29:52.827]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.827 --> 02:29:55.328]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.328 --> 02:29:58.050]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.516 --> 02:30:04.519]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:30:04.519 --> 02:30:09.844]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:30:09.844 --> 02:30:11.906]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:30:11.906 --> 02:30:16.891]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:16.891 --> 02:30:17.812]  How much do you want?
[02:30:18.072 --> 02:30:19.193]  When do you want it?
[02:30:19.193 --> 02:30:21.074]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:30:21.074 --> 02:30:22.154]  When will you need it?
[02:30:22.154 --> 02:30:24.355]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:24.355 --> 02:30:25.696]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:25.696 --> 02:30:27.217]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:27.217 --> 02:30:32.480]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:36.082]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:36.082 --> 02:30:39.544]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:30:39.884 --> 02:30:41.105]  How much will you need?
[02:30:41.105 --> 02:30:42.027]  We don't know.
[02:30:42.027 --> 02:30:43.128]  How much do you want?
[02:30:43.128 --> 02:30:44.049]  All you can get.
[02:30:44.049 --> 02:30:45.150]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:45.150 --> 02:30:48.193]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:30:48.193 --> 02:30:49.975]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:30:49.975 --> 02:30:50.896]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:00.629 --> 02:31:01.930]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:01.930 --> 02:31:07.534]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:31:07.534 --> 02:31:12.537]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:31:12.537 --> 02:31:17.581]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:31:18.121 --> 02:31:23.343]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:31:23.343 --> 02:31:30.445]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:31:30.445 --> 02:31:31.566]  And here's the best part.
[02:31:31.566 --> 02:31:37.928]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:31:38.248 --> 02:31:41.429]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:31:41.429 --> 02:31:43.670]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:44.611]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:31:44.611 --> 02:31:44.931]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:31:44.931 --> 02:31:48.232]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:31:48.232 --> 02:31:49.973]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:02.145 --> 02:32:06.106]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:06.106 --> 02:32:14.987]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:32:14.987 --> 02:32:19.608]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:32:19.608 --> 02:32:30.430]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:32:31.050 --> 02:32:40.572]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:40.572 --> 02:32:45.994]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:32:45.994 --> 02:32:53.495]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:53.495 --> 02:32:56.236]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:33:07.458 --> 02:33:09.640]  I'm the enemy!
[02:33:09.640 --> 02:33:10.200]  Ha ha!
[02:33:41.592 --> 02:33:42.412]  Who are you?
[02:33:42.412 --> 02:33:45.013]  What side are you on?
[02:33:45.013 --> 02:33:47.054]  God says you are neither hot nor cold.
[02:33:47.054 --> 02:33:49.455]  You are lukewarm, so I spit you out of my mouth.
[02:33:49.455 --> 02:33:51.156]  There's nothing worse.
[02:33:52.689 --> 02:33:57.931]  The people who don't choose a side in history, in their own destiny.
[02:33:57.931 --> 02:33:59.732]  I choose the truth.
[02:33:59.732 --> 02:34:01.872]  I choose righteousness.
[02:34:01.872 --> 02:34:03.753]  I choose honor.
[02:34:03.753 --> 02:34:05.434]  And the enemy hates that.
[02:34:05.434 --> 02:34:08.815]  So all they ever try to do is to make us feel powerless.
[02:34:09.977 --> 02:34:17.619]  To make us feel pathetic, but it doesn't work because the people are finding their power, they're finding their strength, they're rising up, they're saying no to tyranny.
[02:34:17.619 --> 02:34:19.199]  All right, I want to continue with your phone calls.
[02:34:19.199 --> 02:34:20.779]  Tarpley coming up.
[02:34:20.779 --> 02:34:23.780]  Got a bunch of other news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:34:23.780 --> 02:34:27.001]  It's exhausting to even look at it.
[02:34:27.001 --> 02:34:28.361]  I mean, look at these headlines.
[02:34:28.361 --> 02:34:30.822]  Police criticized for staging mock burglaries.
[02:34:30.822 --> 02:34:32.362]  No, they actually come into your house and
[02:34:33.766 --> 02:34:37.948]  Police accused of trespass after burgling 50 homes to show owners how insecure they are.
[02:34:37.948 --> 02:34:39.249]  It's all part of training you.
[02:34:39.249 --> 02:34:41.630]  You have no rights.
[02:34:41.630 --> 02:34:47.032]  School apologizes after pupils were frog-marched to be fingerprinted so they could eat in the canteen.
[02:34:47.032 --> 02:34:49.753]  And the school lunch.
[02:34:49.753 --> 02:34:52.835]  Well, hell, they take kids' blood at birth without asking.
[02:34:52.835 --> 02:34:56.016]  They're medicalizing the police now with checkpoints and blood draws.
[02:34:56.016 --> 02:34:59.418]  They have an executive order on the books to take your blood to get a driver's license.
[02:35:01.761 --> 02:35:04.342]  Body scanners, brain scanners, and mobile trucks.
[02:35:04.342 --> 02:35:08.603]  They're just training you that police stick needles in you.
[02:35:08.603 --> 02:35:11.764]  This is hardcore scientific tyranny.
[02:35:11.764 --> 02:35:23.808]  I want to tell you about a few sponsors that have made today's radio show possible, and then we will get back into this Fox News report and then your phone calls.
[02:35:23.808 --> 02:35:29.050]  I mean, it's every 30 minutes or something there's some new mainstream article attacking me and tying me into violent people.
[02:35:30.404 --> 02:35:36.287]  This is getting insane here.
[02:35:36.287 --> 02:35:38.269]  The weird thing is I'm so relaxed.
[02:35:38.269 --> 02:35:45.613]  I'm usually all fired up and angry and everything and I'm just like very calm.
[02:35:45.613 --> 02:35:53.117]  I guess because I know what's going to happen.
[02:35:53.117 --> 02:35:55.259]  It's like I'm outside of it.
[02:35:55.259 --> 02:35:57.220]  More and more I like get outside of things.
[02:36:02.853 --> 02:36:05.574]  Speaking of Michael Savage, he's on screen right now.
[02:36:05.574 --> 02:36:10.216]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of Michael Savage here.
[02:36:10.216 --> 02:36:12.297]  This was almost a year ago, he made this prediction.
[02:36:12.297 --> 02:36:12.958]  Here it is.
[02:36:12.958 --> 02:36:14.238]  Another prediction.
[02:36:14.238 --> 02:36:21.962]  I predict that very soon, Obama will create a crisis along the lines of the Reichstag fire.
[02:36:21.962 --> 02:36:26.484]  I don't know what form it will take, but I believe that once the minions are seen for what they are,
[02:36:27.268 --> 02:36:40.379]  Ram Emanuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in this country of some kind, and they will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton during the Civil War, when civilian suspects were arrested without warrant.
[02:36:40.379 --> 02:36:44.022]  I will tell you as I sit here, I fear that every night as I go to sleep.
[02:36:44.022 --> 02:36:51.569]  I put nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized control of the most powerful economy and the most powerful military on Earth.
[02:36:52.253 --> 02:36:58.515]  No, my friends, I am losing a great deal of sleep every night because I do see this happening right before my eyes.
[02:36:58.515 --> 02:37:00.356]  Again, I will repeat what I just said.
[02:37:00.356 --> 02:37:01.656]  Mark it down.
[02:37:01.656 --> 02:37:06.478]  I again tell you that there will be the equivalent of a crisis on the order of the Reichstag fire.
[02:37:06.478 --> 02:37:07.898]  I don't know where it will occur.
[02:37:07.898 --> 02:37:09.379]  I don't know how it will occur.
[02:37:09.379 --> 02:37:11.280]  I don't know what form it will take.
[02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:21.103]  But during this crisis that will be triggered by the Democrats around Obama, the gang that surrounds Obama, they will bring up Lincoln.
[02:37:21.801 --> 02:37:36.665]  They will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln in other terms during the Civil War, and they will do what Lincoln did, and they will arrest civilians without warrant in the name of saving the economy or saving the government from a right-wing takeover.
[02:37:36.665 --> 02:37:38.866]  Mark my words, you could put that down.
[02:37:41.343 --> 02:37:44.644]  They have the legislation introduced to do just that.
[02:37:44.644 --> 02:37:46.365]  We've been covering the last few weeks.
[02:37:46.365 --> 02:37:52.607]  The reason I play that clip every few weeks here is because he understands the model of the federal takeover.
[02:37:52.607 --> 02:37:57.548]  He understands what they've been positioning for, what they've been setting up.
[02:37:57.548 --> 02:38:00.389]  Dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[02:38:00.389 --> 02:38:01.549]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:38:01.549 --> 02:38:04.310]  You can go read the bill.
[02:38:04.310 --> 02:38:05.931]  You can also read Atlantic Monthly.
[02:38:07.466 --> 02:38:11.289]  We have a link to Atlantic Monthly's article saying exactly what we had to say about it.
[02:38:11.289 --> 02:38:15.312]  This is not just PrisonPlanet.com saying this.
[02:38:15.312 --> 02:38:17.873]  It's not just Judge Andrew Napolitano last Friday.
[02:38:17.873 --> 02:38:32.764]  This says, for any intelligence purpose or any such matters as the President considers appropriate, the military can secretly arrest you, use enhanced detention and interrogation, that means torture, in the Enemy Belligerent Interrogation, Detention, and Prosecution Act of 2010.
[02:38:35.623 --> 02:38:52.798]  And they're going to have all these staged militia busts, and more attacks on IRS buildings, just building up the next few months, more and more, and congressmen getting shot at or shot, and schools being attacked, and bombings.
[02:38:52.798 --> 02:38:59.884]  Look in Greece, how a woman and a child got bombed, or people in a Moscow tube.
[02:38:59.884 --> 02:39:03.367]  It's always the citizens being attacked, because the government are the terrorists.
[02:39:10.137 --> 02:39:26.242]  And this bill says that no one, no court, no one will even ever have to know you've been secretly arrested unless an act of Congress is passed.
[02:39:26.242 --> 02:39:28.483]  So, yes, they're really considering
[02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:33.483]  Everything they've been building towards the last 20 years in this nation.
[02:39:33.483 --> 02:39:36.586]  And what is on the horizon?
[02:39:36.586 --> 02:39:38.428]  What's now right down the street?
[02:39:38.428 --> 02:39:41.630]  What's just a few feet away from us, it's getting closer?
[02:39:41.630 --> 02:39:50.879]  Taking all the pension funds, devaluing the currency, bank holidays, all being announced mainstream news now.
[02:39:50.879 --> 02:39:56.384]  They're demonizing the real militia by promoting cartoon type militias.
[02:39:59.085 --> 02:40:08.412]  Separately, all over the country, they are recruiting, through the sheriffs, federal minion locals with .50 cals and armored vehicles.
[02:40:08.412 --> 02:40:21.221]  So the government is going on and getting its own counterfeit of the militia, an evil militia, to quote, take on protesters with .50 caliber rifles, just to shoot you.
[02:40:21.221 --> 02:40:22.902]  Well, Kurt Nemo wrote about that a month ago.
[02:40:22.902 --> 02:40:25.264]  In fact, I don't remember the headline.
[02:40:25.264 --> 02:40:25.925]  Will you call Kurt?
[02:40:26.897 --> 02:40:37.780]  He linked to several mainstream newspapers and TV stations in Louisiana, and I've seen it in some other states, where it said, oh, they're training with 50 calibers to mow down protesters.
[02:40:37.780 --> 02:40:44.562]  So, oh, I mean, the British in 1776, they have their counterfeit militia.
[02:40:44.562 --> 02:40:48.043]  Their counterfeit.
[02:40:48.043 --> 02:40:50.404]  The more things change, the more they stay the same.
[02:40:50.404 --> 02:40:52.725]  And this is so real, what's happening.
[02:40:53.513 --> 02:41:07.700]  This is a criminal revolution by offshore banks taking over the country and looting and robbing and raising taxes and sucking the money out of everybody.
[02:41:07.700 --> 02:41:09.681]  We're going into bondage.
[02:41:09.681 --> 02:41:13.562]  And the system is going to stage events to make them look like the protectors.
[02:41:13.562 --> 02:41:14.663]  It's very elementary.
[02:41:15.711 --> 02:41:19.553]  And then we've seen how they've done it over and over again, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide.
[02:41:19.553 --> 02:41:28.956]  We have army manuals that are declassified on how to stage events, how to commit massacres, or how to foil fake massacres, get the locals to support you.
[02:41:28.956 --> 02:41:31.837]  Police, you are so manipulated by the feds.
[02:41:31.837 --> 02:41:38.500]  Feds, you're manipulated by your bosses.
[02:41:38.500 --> 02:41:40.921]  All right, let me tell you about a few of the sponsors, then I'm gonna continue here.
[02:41:43.188 --> 02:41:47.370]  Did you know you can be drinking fresh, clean water made right from the air you breathe?
[02:41:47.370 --> 02:41:49.531]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[02:41:49.531 --> 02:41:55.054]  Our sponsor, Ecolablue, with the Ecolablue 28, the brand new Ecolablue 30 machine, will allow you to do just that, and it's easy to use.
[02:41:55.054 --> 02:41:57.495]  It'll make up to 7.5 gallons a day of water.
[02:41:57.495 --> 02:41:58.776]  Great little units.
[02:41:58.776 --> 02:42:00.497]  Check them out at Ecolablue.com.
[02:42:00.497 --> 02:42:02.337]  That's E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com, or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043.
[02:42:02.337 --> 02:42:03.998]  And these are very affordable, wonderful little units.
[02:42:12.938 --> 02:42:17.101]  acolablue.com or 800-691-6043.
[02:42:17.101 --> 02:42:19.243]  The best, purest water you can get, period.
[02:42:19.243 --> 02:42:29.491]  I also want to tell you about mysolarbackup.com.
[02:42:29.491 --> 02:42:31.253]  High quality little solar power unit.
[02:42:31.253 --> 02:42:34.475]  You can get a few of these and run your whole house.
[02:42:34.475 --> 02:42:38.519]  I don't know what it takes, 5, 6, 7 on the average house.
[02:42:38.519 --> 02:42:39.880]  Point is, it's a great system.
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:42.042]  It's a solar panel, little control unit, and the batteries.
[02:42:43.055 --> 02:42:44.296]  MySolarBackup.com.
[02:42:44.296 --> 02:42:46.477]  You can also call them, get a free information package.
[02:42:46.477 --> 02:42:46.537]  877-327-0365.
[02:42:46.537 --> 02:42:46.597]  877-327-0365.
[02:42:46.597 --> 02:42:47.437]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:42:47.437 --> 02:42:47.497]  877-327-0365.
[02:42:47.497 --> 02:42:50.579]  Okay, I don't even really have the energy to read this Fox News hit piece on me.
[02:43:10.441 --> 02:43:14.543]  And there's a CNN special they're now saying it's going to air tonight.
[02:43:14.543 --> 02:43:15.103]  And you heard me.
[02:43:15.103 --> 02:43:16.103]  I said, what's this piece about?
[02:43:16.103 --> 02:43:17.224]  She goes, oh, it's about you.
[02:43:17.224 --> 02:43:23.326]  And, you know, I laugh about that, but it's gallows humor.
[02:43:23.326 --> 02:43:24.607]  It's not it's not fun.
[02:43:24.607 --> 02:43:25.227]  OK.
[02:43:32.458 --> 02:43:33.078]  Yeah, here it is.
[02:43:33.078 --> 02:43:36.059]  Louisiana cops plan for end-of-the-world scenario.
[02:43:36.059 --> 02:43:41.700]  Police in Louisiana, Bashir, Paris are training for an end-of-the-world scenario, according to the Shreveport Times.
[02:43:41.700 --> 02:43:49.821]  The program is dubbed Operation Exodus, inspired in part by the book of Exodus in the Bible.
[02:43:49.821 --> 02:43:55.942]  And it goes on to talk about .50 caliber machine guns being issued to the new special citizen anti-riot group.
[02:43:55.942 --> 02:43:59.703]  Police volunteers will have access to .50 caliber machine gun to put down looters and rioters.
[02:44:02.014 --> 02:44:04.035]  Oh God, help me.
[02:44:04.035 --> 02:44:05.595]  And none of us had to go along with this.
[02:44:05.595 --> 02:44:07.836]  The police and military didn't have to.
[02:44:07.836 --> 02:44:10.237]  But you just have weak brains, a lot of you.
[02:44:10.237 --> 02:44:12.157]  The citizens are even more weak-minded.
[02:44:12.157 --> 02:44:14.418]  I just... I mean, why do I see it all?
[02:44:14.418 --> 02:44:18.800]  Why can't I predict everything they're going to do years before, months before, with total precision?
[02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:28.843]  Because it's simple!
[02:44:28.843 --> 02:44:30.224]  I'm not even upset.
[02:44:30.224 --> 02:44:31.464]  I'm more tired.
[02:44:45.093 --> 02:44:47.235]  You just want to think more of humanity.
[02:44:47.235 --> 02:44:48.736]  You want to think more of the police.
[02:44:48.736 --> 02:44:50.157]  You want to think more of the military.
[02:44:50.157 --> 02:44:52.119]  You want to think more of people in government.
[02:44:52.119 --> 02:44:54.260]  You want to think more of the people at CNN.
[02:44:54.260 --> 02:44:55.921]  You want to think more of the people at Fox.
[02:44:55.921 --> 02:44:57.543]  But they enjoy it.
[02:44:57.543 --> 02:45:00.185]  They feel like they're part of a winning team.
[02:45:00.185 --> 02:45:02.526]  And they're the big glitzy media in the government.
[02:45:02.526 --> 02:45:05.569]  And they can set up and destroy whoever they want.
[02:45:05.569 --> 02:45:08.070]  They're just evil.
[02:45:08.070 --> 02:45:10.012]  Evil is being selfish.
[02:45:10.012 --> 02:45:11.313]  And not caring who you hurt.
[02:45:14.409 --> 02:45:24.952]  And enjoying manipulating people, enjoying lying to people.
[02:45:24.952 --> 02:45:36.936]  I, for one, want it to just stop.
[02:45:36.936 --> 02:45:40.197]  Tyranny isn't cute, it's not fun, it's not cool.
[02:45:41.465 --> 02:45:52.374]  And all of you fools that have joined up for this thing, you have no idea what your controllers have in store for you, or what the controllers are already doing to us.
[02:45:56.431 --> 02:45:58.553]  They really do poison the water supply.
[02:45:58.553 --> 02:46:01.895]  They really do genetically engineer the crops to give you cancer.
[02:46:01.895 --> 02:46:04.617]  They really do put cancer viruses in all the major vaccines.
[02:46:04.617 --> 02:46:17.246]  I mean, I was going through news from last week here and I was reading all these articles about cancer viruses and pig cancer viruses and the shots for the kids and it was mainstream news.
[02:46:17.246 --> 02:46:18.567]  Who comes up with this stuff?
[02:46:18.567 --> 02:46:19.128]  Why?
[02:46:19.128 --> 02:46:19.588]  Why?
[02:46:19.588 --> 02:46:21.970]  And I'm bad because I don't
[02:46:28.996 --> 02:46:38.520]  It's the weight of the knowledge.
[02:46:38.520 --> 02:46:46.103]  Because I know 99% of people taking part in this don't understand the big picture.
[02:46:46.103 --> 02:46:51.045]  And if you did, if you knew, you would not be part of this.
[02:46:58.450 --> 02:47:07.734]  And I can't imagine, but I can imagine, and that's the problem, but at one level I can't imagine, another I can.
[02:47:07.734 --> 02:47:14.136]  The mindset of the controllers, they know everything I know and more.
[02:47:14.136 --> 02:47:25.781]  The master controllers, they see what they're doing, they've designed it, and because they know that information, they also know humans' true potential.
[02:47:25.781 --> 02:47:26.982]  And I can't imagine
[02:47:28.115 --> 02:47:48.673]  Myself being in the mindset of wanting to dumb people down, wanting to hurt people, wanting to mutate humanity, wanting to be part of all of this.
[02:47:48.673 --> 02:47:50.235]  And so what they do is,
[02:47:55.819 --> 02:48:00.304]  Somebody kills a cop, they blame it on me, proven it, person hated me.
[02:48:00.304 --> 02:48:03.107]  Or they set up a group and they try to tie him in with Alex Jones.
[02:48:03.107 --> 02:48:16.922]  Or they set up this guy in Tennessee and post his address and name on my comment board on my website and then try to tie it in in the news, calling it a radical website of Alex Jones.
[02:48:21.957 --> 02:48:24.498]  It says both posts have been removed by the site.
[02:48:24.498 --> 02:48:28.279]  Earlier this month, of course the cops gave him this information.
[02:48:28.279 --> 02:48:32.620]  Earlier this month, or it was given to the Southern Poverty Law Center or ADL and that was given to Fox.
[02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:44.164]  Earlier this month, the ACA posted a series of comments in which he talked about killing police officers and other law enforcement officers.
[02:48:44.164 --> 02:48:48.625]  And see, they never say that this guy is guilty until proven innocent.
[02:48:49.684 --> 02:48:50.924]  But that's what they're doing here.
[02:48:50.924 --> 02:48:53.925]  This is guilty until proven innocent, not innocent until proven guilty.
[02:48:53.925 --> 02:48:55.685]  They're now saying he's guilty.
[02:48:55.685 --> 02:49:02.367]  They just say he did it, even though they never say he's admitted to doing it.
[02:49:02.367 --> 02:49:10.889]  In one, he claimed to keep an AR-15 assault rifle by his door and loaded a 12-gauge shotgun nearby, and he said he'd like to use both to kill police.
[02:49:10.889 --> 02:49:15.650]  The Naval Base spokesman said only one weapon, the shotgun, was removed from the man's home.
[02:49:18.197 --> 02:49:30.279]  ACA has also praised the actions of Joe Stack, the anti-tax Texan, who last month crashed a small plane into an Austin building that houses the IRS office, killing one of the workers.
[02:49:30.279 --> 02:49:35.180]  ACA said in one online post that Stack didn't have enough explosives on board the plane.
[02:49:35.180 --> 02:49:41.701]  In another post, he implored others to target Transportation Secretary Administration employees.
[02:49:41.701 --> 02:49:45.362]  And in an earlier post, he wrote, TSA, truly stupid a-holes.
[02:49:46.325 --> 02:49:53.947]  The guy that lived next to me worked for them and I made his life a living hell until he moved.
[02:49:53.947 --> 02:50:08.351]  One Monday morning, NCIS agents and base security located ACA at the address, that was yesterday, and privately owned on-base housing unit that he posted in a recent comment on InfoWars.com.
[02:50:08.351 --> 02:50:12.592]  He admitted to posting the comment, said base spokesman David Crenshaw.
[02:50:13.885 --> 02:50:15.785]  The man's name was not revealed.
[02:50:15.785 --> 02:50:23.667]  But see, I've had base security people lie about my employees before, so I don't... And this guy called here saying he hadn't done this, so I don't know what's true.
[02:50:23.667 --> 02:50:32.448]  Based on the statements, the installation commanding officer requested the resident surrender any weapons to the base security for safekeeping until the investigation could be completed.
[02:50:32.448 --> 02:50:36.129]  The resident was cooperative and compliant with the request.
[02:50:36.129 --> 02:50:43.070]  The Naval Criminal Investigative Services and the installation security team are conducting an investigation, and the statement is to determine if there is any criminal wrongdoing.
[02:50:44.448 --> 02:50:50.112]  The action was taken after FoxNews.com inquired about the online comment.
[02:50:50.112 --> 02:50:51.032]  I hadn't read the whole article.
[02:50:51.032 --> 02:50:53.454]  They just gave this to me.
[02:50:53.454 --> 02:50:55.555]  Fox News is on my website.
[02:50:55.555 --> 02:50:58.937]  Probably Glen Beck's people looking for stuff to talk.
[02:50:58.937 --> 02:51:00.178]  Oh, my God.
[02:51:00.178 --> 02:51:05.021]  Fox News, man.
[02:51:05.021 --> 02:51:10.645]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[02:51:11.300 --> 02:51:13.501]  The world is changing fast.
[02:51:13.501 --> 02:51:15.763]  Are you fully prepared?
[02:51:15.763 --> 02:51:18.945]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[02:51:18.945 --> 02:51:29.691]  At PatriotFood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned meat for half price.
[02:51:29.691 --> 02:51:39.377]  And at SurvivalistSeeds.com, we now offer 50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over 10,000 heirloom seeds.
[02:51:41.024 --> 02:51:45.868]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[02:51:45.868 --> 02:51:50.491]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[02:51:50.491 --> 02:51:53.433]  Food insurance, just in case.
[02:51:53.433 --> 02:51:55.495]  Owned by me, Big John Lipston.
[02:52:00.822 --> 02:52:03.224]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.224 --> 02:52:05.526]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.526 --> 02:52:08.749]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.749 --> 02:52:13.853]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:13.853 --> 02:52:18.057]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.357 --> 02:52:20.820]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.820 --> 02:52:23.263]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.263 --> 02:52:26.526]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.526 --> 02:52:34.095]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.455 --> 02:52:39.719]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:39.719 --> 02:52:42.701]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.701 --> 02:52:46.383]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.383 --> 02:52:47.444]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.444 --> 02:52:48.804]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:48.804 --> 02:52:50.285]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:51.606 --> 02:53:52.927]  MyPillow, for the rest of your life.
[02:54:30.015 --> 02:54:39.299]  Yeah, they came in during the break about 20 minutes ago.
[02:54:39.299 --> 02:54:43.421]  The break before last and gave us, I mean, I hadn't had a chance to read the whole thing yet.
[02:54:43.421 --> 02:54:45.422]  It's a long article.
[02:54:47.065 --> 02:54:51.387]  And it says, this action was taken after FoxNews.com inquired about the online comments.
[02:54:51.387 --> 02:54:55.208]  So, there are literally millions of violent and threatening comments.
[02:54:55.208 --> 02:54:57.389]  I mean, you go to YouTube, they're just everywhere.
[02:54:57.389 --> 02:54:59.270]  I'm gonna come to your house and kill you.
[02:54:59.270 --> 02:55:00.670]  I'm gonna do this.
[02:55:00.670 --> 02:55:02.311]  Somebody needs to go after Obama.
[02:55:02.311 --> 02:55:03.892]  Somebody needs to do this.
[02:55:03.892 --> 02:55:14.296]  But, CNN, Fox, all of them, Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, they just climb over the site, reporting this to the feds,
[02:55:15.695 --> 02:55:21.517]  So that they can then have pieces implying I have a radical bad website.
[02:55:21.517 --> 02:55:28.800]  I'll guarantee you we can go search databases of Fox News and Fox Nation comment boards and find stuff.
[02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:30.881]  It's just insane!
[02:55:30.881 --> 02:55:38.864]  Until you understand they're trying to set us up and create this idea that Alex Jones is violent and bad and has to be brought down and has to be dealt with.
[02:55:41.241 --> 02:55:45.882]  Even though he's a civilian, the man is living on a military base, making him a subject of rules on that base.
[02:55:45.882 --> 02:55:54.485]  The commanding officer has the authority to take any weapons that are on the base, whether they belong to a member of the military or a civilian, and store them at the armory.
[02:55:54.485 --> 02:55:57.966]  For the same reason, the NCIS has the authority to arrest him.
[02:55:57.966 --> 02:56:04.808]  The man who has not been charged will be permitted to check his shotgun out of the armory, but he will be monitored while doing so, Crenshaw said.
[02:56:04.808 --> 02:56:10.030]  NCIS at the base security force will continue to monitor the man as they conduct the investigation.
[02:56:13.988 --> 02:56:16.009]  This isn't even proper English.
[02:56:16.009 --> 02:56:21.772]  They will continue to monitor the man as they conducts their investigation.
[02:56:21.772 --> 02:56:28.756]  Thus far, Crenshaw said it appeared to investigators that the man had not violated any law.
[02:56:28.756 --> 02:56:30.737]  Well, that sounds like a setup then.
[02:56:30.737 --> 02:56:34.419]  Threatening violence is taken very seriously, but it's not necessarily a legal act.
[02:56:34.419 --> 02:56:42.903]  There's freedom of speech, Crenshaw said, adding that investigators would step in if they sensed the man was going to take action and that his online rants were more than just blather.
[02:56:50.299 --> 02:56:58.585]  Crenshaw said he did not know if Madman, the commenter who replied to ACA's post, was being sought by investigators.
[02:56:58.585 --> 02:57:14.277]  Well, everybody has enjoyed the comment sections of InfoWars and Prison Planet, but we've tried to not go to a registration system, but we've got to just now go to a strong registration system.
[02:57:14.277 --> 02:57:18.460]  But we tried it once and then they just put fake emails and fake names and fake IPs in.
[02:57:19.352 --> 02:57:27.018]  To do all this, and they're trying a lot of other stuff too.
[02:57:27.018 --> 02:57:32.603]  They call into the show and say, you know, basically, you're a coward, you need to call for violence, Alex.
[02:57:32.603 --> 02:57:34.645]  Trying to manipulate me into that.
[02:57:34.645 --> 02:57:37.747]  I genuinely believe violence is not the answer.
[02:57:37.747 --> 02:57:39.649]  And I've always explained that.
[02:57:39.649 --> 02:57:41.210]  Information is the answer.
[02:57:41.210 --> 02:57:43.992]  The system stages violent acts over and over again.
[02:57:45.013 --> 02:57:50.317]  As a pretext to demonize legitimate constitutional debate.
[02:57:50.317 --> 02:57:52.379]  We're winning in all the polls.
[02:57:52.379 --> 02:57:54.120]  The people are really waking up.
[02:57:54.120 --> 02:58:02.326]  That's why the system is going to stage terror attacks and blame them on the Patriot, the Conservative, the Libertarian, the Second Amendment groups, the Tea Parties.
[02:58:02.326 --> 02:58:06.689]  And yours truly, number one, I'm the big enemy.
[02:58:06.689 --> 02:58:08.751]  I'm not controlled opposition like Glenn Beck.
[02:58:08.751 --> 02:58:09.551]  I'm real.
[02:58:09.551 --> 02:58:10.412]  The system knows that.
[02:58:14.466 --> 02:58:23.830]  And we have educated tens of millions of people, and we're exponentially growing, and they know that.
[02:58:23.830 --> 02:58:27.271]  But I should be glad they're just trying to demonize me, because that's probably the extent of it.
[02:58:27.271 --> 02:58:31.393]  They know if they kill me or set me up, that'll be too obvious.
[02:58:31.393 --> 02:58:32.813]  But who knows?
[02:58:32.813 --> 02:58:37.995]  But regardless, I know I've done this to wake people up and try to save my beloved country.
[02:58:37.995 --> 02:58:39.996]  My forefathers did a lot more, so I'm honored.
[02:58:41.531 --> 02:58:47.153]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:47.153 --> 02:58:50.995]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:50.995 --> 02:58:55.237]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:58:55.237 --> 02:58:56.497]  Tyranny is here.
[02:58:56.497 --> 02:59:00.439]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:59:00.439 --> 02:59:02.660]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:59:02.660 --> 02:59:07.722]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:59:08.522 --> 02:59:15.184]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:59:15.184 --> 02:59:21.165]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:59:21.165 --> 02:59:25.346]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:59:25.346 --> 02:59:29.627]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:59:29.627 --> 02:59:32.428]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,
[02:59:32.848 --> 02:59:35.589]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:59:35.589 --> 02:59:39.130]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:59:39.130 --> 02:59:41.110]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:59:41.110 --> 02:59:42.230]  It's here.

[02:59:54.214 --> 02:59:56.594]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.594 --> 02:59:59.375]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.086 --> 03:00:21.387]  It's already the fourth and final hour.
[03:00:21.387 --> 03:00:24.468]  We're going to have a lot of other important news I haven't gotten to yet.
[03:00:24.468 --> 03:00:34.131]  We will cover in this hour, like biometric scans for traffic stops, James Lovelock, humans are too stupid to prevent climate change.
[03:00:34.131 --> 03:00:36.372]  That's the founder of the Gaia
[03:00:37.503 --> 03:00:39.584]  World Population Reduction Movement.
[03:00:39.584 --> 03:00:41.205]  You're just too stupid.
[03:00:41.205 --> 03:00:45.467]  He's the expert up on the mountain.
[03:00:45.467 --> 03:00:54.392]  We got Webster Tarpley coming up in the next segment to talk about a host of issues including the situation with the militia.
[03:00:55.620 --> 03:01:00.483]  Arrest all over the country and the situation over in Russia with the subway bombings.
[03:01:00.483 --> 03:01:02.864]  We'll get Dr. Tarpley's take on all that.
[03:01:02.864 --> 03:01:04.285]  We'll take a few calls right now.
[03:01:04.285 --> 03:01:06.306]  We'll continue with calls throughout the hour.
[03:01:06.306 --> 03:01:07.207]  Jeff in Hawaii.
[03:01:07.207 --> 03:01:07.847]  You're on the air.
[03:01:07.847 --> 03:01:10.168]  Hey Alex.
[03:01:10.168 --> 03:01:10.889]  Hey buddy.
[03:01:10.889 --> 03:01:14.651]  Jeff in Kauai.
[03:01:14.651 --> 03:01:15.812]  How are you doing today?
[03:01:15.812 --> 03:01:16.872]  I'm doing a broadcast.
[03:01:16.872 --> 03:01:18.733]  You want some?
[03:01:18.733 --> 03:01:19.774]  Alright.
[03:01:19.774 --> 03:01:22.536]  While I was calling, did you check out the head
[03:01:23.740 --> 03:01:26.262]  Headline on Drudge today?
[03:01:26.262 --> 03:01:29.345]  No.
[03:01:29.345 --> 03:01:30.566]  You should go to it.
[03:01:30.566 --> 03:01:37.711]  It's all about them putting machine guns in the subways in New York now.
[03:01:37.711 --> 03:01:39.593]  Oh yeah, I saw that.
[03:01:39.593 --> 03:01:44.637]  They've got cops in black uniforms and armor with machine guns everywhere searching people.
[03:01:44.637 --> 03:01:48.420]  It's part of the acclamation for full military occupation.
[03:01:49.827 --> 03:01:52.269]  Yeah, it's just like your video's police state.
[03:01:52.269 --> 03:01:56.451]  I mean, when I saw that, I was like, I was blown away.
[03:01:56.451 --> 03:01:58.493]  Well, that's been going on for a long time.
[03:01:58.493 --> 03:01:59.993]  That's the New York Post.
[03:01:59.993 --> 03:02:03.496]  We'll put that headline back up there for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[03:02:03.496 --> 03:02:06.678]  Rail cops go great guns.
[03:02:06.678 --> 03:02:16.264]  And, again, government stages the events, then they put police in stormtrooper outfits everywhere to sell the message, tyranny keeps you safe.
[03:02:17.452 --> 03:02:23.956]  But really, they're just getting ready to take the pension funds, so they want to be ready to clamp down on everybody.
[03:02:23.956 --> 03:02:30.539]  And if anybody gets angry at them taking your pension fund, well, you're a terrorist!
[03:02:30.539 --> 03:02:38.423]  Yeah, it just seems like anybody that stands up to the government, they've basically labeled you as a terrorist, right?
[03:02:38.423 --> 03:02:39.684]  That's what they're doing to me right now.
[03:02:39.684 --> 03:02:41.925]  I appreciate your call, Jeff.
[03:02:41.925 --> 03:02:42.646]  Good to hear from you.
[03:02:42.646 --> 03:02:43.946]  Ken in Michigan, you're on the air.
[03:02:43.946 --> 03:02:46.508]  Hello?
[03:02:46.508 --> 03:02:46.788]  Yes, sir.
[03:02:48.109 --> 03:02:49.950]  Hey, Alex.
[03:02:49.950 --> 03:02:52.892]  Can you believe they're calling us hatreds now?
[03:02:52.892 --> 03:02:54.953]  Hatreds, yes.
[03:02:54.953 --> 03:02:59.396]  Well, we do hate tyranny, so I guess it's true, and they hate freedom.
[03:02:59.396 --> 03:03:00.517]  Oh, man.
[03:03:00.517 --> 03:03:06.321]  At least we're not traitors, you know?
[03:03:06.321 --> 03:03:08.422]  Not treasonous scum.
[03:03:08.422 --> 03:03:09.683]  That's all I gotta say.
[03:03:09.683 --> 03:03:11.064]  Well, what they are is criminals.
[03:03:11.064 --> 03:03:16.207]  I mean, no one can deny that criminals run the government and are robbing everything that isn't nailed down.
[03:03:17.335 --> 03:03:20.436]  So see through on the news is not even funny.
[03:03:20.436 --> 03:03:20.836]  I can't.
[03:03:20.836 --> 03:03:24.156]  I mean, I was in the NJROTC in high school.
[03:03:24.156 --> 03:03:26.537]  I know their playbook.
[03:03:26.537 --> 03:03:28.817]  I know how they work.
[03:03:28.817 --> 03:03:32.138]  Well, what's on your mind, Ken?
[03:03:32.138 --> 03:03:44.200]  I was just, uh, you know, these CNN, you know, media whores trying to blow you up on the news there.
[03:03:44.200 --> 03:03:46.541]  Don't let them get to you, dude.
[03:03:47.608 --> 03:03:49.409]  No, no, that's not what's getting to me, Ken.
[03:03:49.409 --> 03:03:52.270]  I'm not thinking about myself.
[03:03:52.270 --> 03:03:53.550]  Okay?
[03:03:53.550 --> 03:04:05.094]  It's the next phase, the staged terror attacks that government is going to stage and has been staging to blame on Americans that are standing up against the New World Order.
[03:04:05.094 --> 03:04:07.155]  That's the issue.
[03:04:07.155 --> 03:04:12.696]  They got CIA guys confessing on YouTube about them FEMA camps.
[03:04:12.696 --> 03:04:13.957]  Getting ready to put Christians and
[03:04:15.683 --> 03:04:18.745]  You know, and they're in Patriots, Gassers.
[03:04:37.739 --> 03:04:40.283]  Also go over some of the good news happening worldwide.
[03:04:40.283 --> 03:04:47.432]  The carbon tax is being overturned or not passing all over Europe and major nations like France.
[03:04:47.432 --> 03:04:49.595]  So people are definitely waking up.
[03:04:49.595 --> 03:04:53.921]  But we're going to look at the establishment's next move in their playbook.
[03:05:00.372 --> 03:05:08.197]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[03:05:08.197 --> 03:05:13.320]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[03:05:13.320 --> 03:05:22.065]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[03:05:22.065 --> 03:05:24.067]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[03:05:26.101 --> 03:05:28.328]  I guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[03:05:30.421 --> 03:05:35.144]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[03:05:35.144 --> 03:05:38.986]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[03:05:38.986 --> 03:05:40.207]  Others don't.
[03:05:40.207 --> 03:05:42.368]  We turn jeans inside out.
[03:05:42.368 --> 03:05:44.149]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[03:05:44.149 --> 03:05:47.031]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[03:05:47.031 --> 03:05:53.655]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[03:05:53.655 --> 03:05:56.357]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[03:05:56.357 --> 03:05:58.738]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[03:05:58.738 --> 03:05:59.599]  Others don't.
[03:06:01.581 --> 03:06:04.602]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.602 --> 03:06:09.924]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:09.924 --> 03:06:11.985]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:11.985 --> 03:06:16.986]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:16.986 --> 03:06:18.167]  How much do you want?
[03:06:18.167 --> 03:06:19.287]  When do you want it?
[03:06:19.287 --> 03:06:21.168]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:21.168 --> 03:06:22.248]  When will you need it?
[03:06:22.248 --> 03:06:24.449]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.449 --> 03:06:25.790]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:25.790 --> 03:06:27.090]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:27.310 --> 03:06:32.574]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:32.574 --> 03:06:36.157]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:36.157 --> 03:06:39.979]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:39.979 --> 03:06:41.200]  How much will you need?
[03:06:41.200 --> 03:06:42.101]  We don't know.
[03:06:42.101 --> 03:06:43.202]  How much do you want?
[03:06:43.202 --> 03:06:44.142]  All you can get.
[03:06:44.142 --> 03:06:44.823]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:45.323 --> 03:06:45.944]  We're good to go!
[03:07:01.004 --> 03:07:02.165]  What's your home worth?
[03:07:02.165 --> 03:07:04.265]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[03:07:04.265 --> 03:07:07.307]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[03:07:07.307 --> 03:07:15.030]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[03:08:01.938 --> 03:08:07.479]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:19.420 --> 03:08:23.343]  Webster Griffin Tarpely, a doctor of history and economics.
[03:08:23.343 --> 03:08:28.746]  He features, of course, every week or two here on the radio show as one of our analysts.
[03:08:28.746 --> 03:08:33.289]  He's also in my film, Fall of the Republic and the Obama Deception.
[03:08:33.289 --> 03:08:37.072]  And he's done some of the most hardcore, in-depth research out there.
[03:08:37.072 --> 03:08:38.433]  I really respect his opinion.
[03:08:38.433 --> 03:08:38.813]  Now, look.
[03:08:40.899 --> 03:08:45.140]  I know that Russian intelligence services have staged false flag events before.
[03:08:45.140 --> 03:08:47.921]  The British do it, the Israelis do it, the U.S.
[03:08:47.921 --> 03:08:48.261]  does it.
[03:08:48.261 --> 03:08:51.903]  This is a tool of government.
[03:08:51.903 --> 03:08:58.725]  And Paul Watson wrote an article saying Moscow Metro Blast, another FSB inside job.
[03:09:01.027 --> 03:09:08.994]  And then Watson looks at the fact that in 99 police caught FSB planting bombs in a fourth apartment building.
[03:09:08.994 --> 03:09:10.495]  Three have been blown up.
[03:09:10.495 --> 03:09:18.862]  Now Tarpley would say this is some type of triple, double-cross, false flag by the West.
[03:09:18.862 --> 03:09:21.504]  And he's got quotes from Putin saying similar things.
[03:09:21.504 --> 03:09:22.906]  But I look at 99.
[03:09:22.906 --> 03:09:25.568]  Putin wasn't probably going to win as the vice president of Yeltsin.
[03:09:27.745 --> 03:09:34.968]  But then saying the Chechenians had attacked him on pretext of his vice president to lead a popular war.
[03:09:34.968 --> 03:09:37.869]  But Tarpley and I have argued back and forth about this.
[03:09:37.869 --> 03:09:39.109]  I'm only looking for the truth.
[03:09:39.109 --> 03:09:43.991]  And I know that Tarpley's looking for the truth on this, but I know that the West got behind Putin
[03:09:45.217 --> 03:09:45.557]  I think?
[03:10:05.782 --> 03:10:07.523]  They're really coming after us right now.
[03:10:07.523 --> 03:10:11.746]  I want to ask Tarpley why we're so much in the crosshairs.
[03:10:11.746 --> 03:10:21.872]  Clearly this is an attempt to demonize any populist or true constitutionalist movement in the Tea Parties and make them fully run by the Republicans.
[03:10:21.872 --> 03:10:23.413]  And I was talking to Tarpley about that during the break.
[03:10:23.413 --> 03:10:25.294]  He agreed on that front.
[03:10:25.294 --> 03:10:28.876]  And I see April to be a big month of staged events.
[03:10:28.876 --> 03:10:31.078]  You've got the insurance companies taking over health care.
[03:10:32.071 --> 03:10:34.273]  We'll get Tarpley's take on that.
[03:10:34.273 --> 03:10:36.215]  Webster, Griffin, Tarpley, what do you want to tackle first?
[03:10:36.215 --> 03:10:37.956]  The militia information?
[03:10:37.956 --> 03:10:41.359]  Let's go with Russia because this gets us the big picture in the world.
[03:10:41.359 --> 03:10:42.881]  Go!
[03:10:42.881 --> 03:10:44.262]  The Moscow subway bombing.
[03:10:46.568 --> 03:10:50.112]  With these things going back now decades, right?
[03:10:50.112 --> 03:11:01.545]  The Chechen and related Caucasus, North Caucasus terror groups, and there are about a dozen very small nationalities, ethnic groups there.
[03:11:01.545 --> 03:11:04.689]  It's called the Ethnic Labyrinth of the North Caucasus.
[03:11:05.811 --> 03:11:14.481]  Chechnya, Dagestan, the Circassians, the Gabardino-Bulgarian, tiny little entities.
[03:11:14.481 --> 03:11:17.745]  It's the most diverse area in the world in that sense.
[03:11:17.745 --> 03:11:20.929]  And it's been an area of conflict for centuries, really.
[03:11:20.929 --> 03:11:24.333]  It was the border between the Turkish Empire and the Russian Empire.
[03:11:24.853 --> 03:11:30.856]  So, the CIA and British support for Chechen terrorism is just notorious, right?
[03:11:30.856 --> 03:11:40.741]  The leader of the Chechen terrorists was this guy, Basayev, who was trained in a CIA camp in Afghanistan, and this is just well known.
[03:11:40.741 --> 03:11:44.643]  So, the suspect, the suspicion always goes directly
[03:11:45.083 --> 03:11:45.804]  To the U.S.
[03:11:45.804 --> 03:11:46.604]  and the British.
[03:11:46.604 --> 03:12:00.536]  Putin said back in 2001 that if you want to join the Chechen terror organization, you can go to London, and there's a place where pretty much openly they do recruiting for that, right in the middle of Londonistan.
[03:12:00.536 --> 03:12:03.498]  So, the question is, why now, right?
[03:12:03.498 --> 03:12:08.162]  There was this attack last November on the Moscow to St.
[03:12:08.162 --> 03:12:10.724]  Petersburg Express, right?
[03:12:10.724 --> 03:12:14.387]  The Nevsky super train that they have, and that killed about 30 people.
[03:12:15.187 --> 03:12:25.016]  Now, the Russians have tracked down and killed the person that they say is responsible for that, and that was wrapped up at the beginning of March, about a month ago now.
[03:12:25.016 --> 03:12:27.798]  So, in the meantime, though, what's the big picture?
[03:12:28.610 --> 03:12:30.371]  Remember, the goal of the U.S.
[03:12:30.371 --> 03:12:32.952]  is to split Russia from China, right?
[03:12:32.952 --> 03:12:37.975]  To drive a wedge between Russia and China and foment conflict there.
[03:12:37.975 --> 03:12:41.516]  They're also interested in being friends with Russia.
[03:12:41.516 --> 03:12:44.818]  We just have this new nuclear arms treaty, right?
[03:12:44.818 --> 03:12:46.619]  The so-called START treaty between
[03:12:47.599 --> 03:12:48.780]  Russia and the United States.
[03:12:48.780 --> 03:12:58.826]  Nobody really knows the details yet, but it's going to be signed soon, and then presumably we'll see it, to play Russia, however, against China and against Iran, in which the U.S.
[03:12:58.826 --> 03:13:01.407]  becomes friends with Russia, but for a price.
[03:13:01.407 --> 03:13:08.692]  And the price always is friction with China, friction with Iran, because the idea is to get conflict going in those areas.
[03:13:09.597 --> 03:13:15.300]  The anger and resentment on the part of the Anglo-Americans against Russia would be this.
[03:13:15.300 --> 03:13:22.623]  We just had the meeting of Putin, now the Russian Prime Minister, with this guy Xi, his name is.
[03:13:22.623 --> 03:13:24.384]  It's written X-I.
[03:13:24.384 --> 03:13:26.085]  He's the Vice President of China.
[03:13:27.145 --> 03:13:31.548]  And he's going to become the president of China, at least he's the heir apparent.
[03:13:31.548 --> 03:13:44.115]  When the Chinese Party Congress meets in the fall of 2012, this guy Xi, again with X-I, is going to become the president, if all goes according to what is thought.
[03:13:44.115 --> 03:13:50.599]  So this idea is already important, that Putin is cementing a permanent alliance of Russia with China, right?
[03:13:50.599 --> 03:13:56.203]  That's the elementary thing for anybody in the world to be able to resist the Anglo-Americans.
[03:13:57.043 --> 03:13:59.246]  The other thing is Ukraine, right?
[03:13:59.246 --> 03:14:06.456]  Ukraine, we had this big color revolution staged by this big new Brzezinski NATO intelligence and so forth.
[03:14:06.456 --> 03:14:10.221]  And they took over the government with a puppet regime in the fall of 2004.
[03:14:10.221 --> 03:14:13.506]  And that puppet regime is now completely gone.
[03:14:13.926 --> 03:14:16.549]  The puppet president, Yushchenko, is out.
[03:14:16.549 --> 03:14:19.373]  The puppet prime minister, Tymoshenko, is out.
[03:14:19.373 --> 03:14:24.779]  And the guy you have in there now is Yanukovych, and he's more or less a reasonable Ukrainian, right?
[03:14:24.779 --> 03:14:29.945]  Not a slave of Moscow, not a slave of NATO or the European Union, but a Ukrainian.
[03:14:29.945 --> 03:14:33.489]  And that is not enough, however, for the NATO side.
[03:14:34.344 --> 03:14:38.628]  The other thing then is what the Russians are doing in Iran.
[03:14:38.628 --> 03:14:42.532]  In Iran, the color revolution there never got off the ground.
[03:14:42.532 --> 03:14:45.254]  It seems to have just about disappeared completely.
[03:14:45.254 --> 03:14:52.761]  Let me stop you for a moment as we continue to go around the different geopolitical regions here, Webster.
[03:14:52.761 --> 03:14:53.862]  This is the issue.
[03:14:53.862 --> 03:14:54.403]  Why?
[03:14:54.403 --> 03:14:56.565]  And we know that a lot of the different Chechen
[03:14:58.210 --> 03:15:03.314]  And Muslim minority groups and in some areas majority groups in that entire area.
[03:15:03.314 --> 03:15:07.757]  We know the West has been funding them since during the Cold War.
[03:15:07.757 --> 03:15:17.805]  Of course, you go further east over into Afghanistan and those areas, they were publicly funded as Mujahideen and these great saviors.
[03:15:17.805 --> 03:15:21.708]  So we know that's going on, but answer me this.
[03:15:21.708 --> 03:15:26.051]  Why would the West want to start bombing Putin
[03:15:27.341 --> 03:15:36.294]  When he is running for the presidency, when an elementary school student who understands this would know that terror attacks against a
[03:15:37.648 --> 03:15:38.169]  We're good to go.
[03:16:00.109 --> 03:16:13.753]  And Medvedev, how does that hurt them when this will clearly allow them to crack down, expand operations, and play the part of strongmen protecting the Russian bear's cubs?
[03:16:13.753 --> 03:16:16.014]  I mean, I'm just trying to understand the key bono here.
[03:16:16.014 --> 03:16:16.534]  Who benefits?
[03:16:17.185 --> 03:16:27.469]  Just remember now that there is a strategy of the US and the British which was published in a somewhat diluted form in the London Economist back in August-September of 2004.
[03:16:27.469 --> 03:16:33.392]  How you split Russia, in other words break up the whole Russian Federation,
[03:16:33.992 --> 03:16:45.081]  Starting from these places in the North Caucasus and the South Caucasus, because you've got Georgia there, you've got Armenia, you've got Azerbaijan, but then in the North Caucasus you've got this array of a dozen others.
[03:16:45.081 --> 03:17:01.394]  And the idea is that if you can get an endless civil war in this area, this can then spread to other smaller units of the Russian Federation, and with the non-ethnic Russian parts of the Russian Federation, because the Russian Federation is a big multinational state, right?
[03:17:01.394 --> 03:17:02.675]  It's got all sorts of different
[03:17:03.055 --> 03:17:03.876]  Ethnic groups in it.
[03:17:03.876 --> 03:17:07.458]  So the idea is always to use this for greater splitting.
[03:17:07.458 --> 03:17:14.984]  Now, concerning Putin, Putin, of course, is heavily identified with the KGB, FSB, and the security services.
[03:17:14.984 --> 03:17:23.490]  So, to a significant degree, his reputation depends on effective fighting against these terrorists, right?
[03:17:23.490 --> 03:17:27.473]  So if you have a big, high-profile event like this,
[03:17:28.193 --> 03:17:30.894]  In a certain way, you could say, well, this makes Putin look bad.
[03:17:30.894 --> 03:17:38.017]  Maybe in the secret councils of the Kremlin, people come forward and say, hey, Putin, you're not doing a very good job.
[03:17:38.017 --> 03:17:55.485]  And the hope, I think, is that the Anglo-Americans, once again, to drive a wedge, in this case, a wedge between Putin and Medvedev, so that Putin looks bad and Medvedev, who is a relatively untested figure by comparison to Putin, we don't know really how Medvedev responds
[03:17:55.905 --> 03:17:56.385]  We're good to go.
[03:18:18.390 --> 03:18:23.632]  Just concerning Iran, the color revolution there is failing, and it's failing with Russian help.
[03:18:23.632 --> 03:18:25.433]  Russian help, now very specific.
[03:18:25.433 --> 03:18:34.916]  The Russians have started, once again, building the Bushehr nuclear reactor, and one of the big goals of the U.S., the British, and the Israelis is to prevent
[03:18:35.416 --> 03:18:39.399]  This Boucher nuclear reactor from ever going online.
[03:18:39.399 --> 03:18:44.163]  Finally, and this gets us into Europe, you have this South Stream pipeline.
[03:18:44.163 --> 03:18:49.687]  There are two competing pipelines there in the, sort of, from the Black Sea over to Southern Europe.
[03:18:49.687 --> 03:18:59.214]  One of them is the South Stream, that's the Russian plan, and that has the support of Turkey, which again, London and Washington don't like, and above all of Italy, and that's Berlusconi.
[03:18:59.714 --> 03:19:05.315]  Berlusconi is the biggest ally of Putin in Western Europe, and you see what happened to him, right?
[03:19:05.315 --> 03:19:11.057]  He got hit with this heavy, super heavy paperweight back in December.
[03:19:11.057 --> 03:19:20.119]  Well, Berlusconi has just won the Italian regional election, so the huge international campaign against Berlusconi has also flopped.
[03:19:20.499 --> 03:19:38.090]  So if you look at the Anglo-Americans, they failed in Ukraine, they're going nowhere with Iran, their plan for a color revolution, the Violet Revolution in Italy, is also going nowhere, and Putin is making, he's building bridges to China and building this pipeline.
[03:19:38.090 --> 03:19:45.755]  So I think that's sort of an area, you can see all of the reasons that there's rage in London and Washington against Moscow.
[03:19:46.656 --> 03:19:51.343]  And this attempted bombing of the FSB headquarters from below from the subway.
[03:19:51.343 --> 03:19:54.808]  Let's talk about where the globalists are going next.
[03:19:54.808 --> 03:20:00.395]  And then I want to talk about the fact that I am being demonized big time by the media right now.
[03:20:01.781 --> 03:20:05.706]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.

[03:24:20.936 --> 03:24:22.858]  Look, it's elementary.
[03:24:22.858 --> 03:24:29.843]  I started seeing them a year ago demonize the Tea Parties, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[03:24:29.843 --> 03:24:34.187]  Mainline conservatives who don't want to be looted by the banks.
[03:24:34.187 --> 03:24:40.832]  This is the largest contingent out there that's middle America that threatens the banking takeover.
[03:24:40.832 --> 03:24:49.680]  Now we have Bloomberg announcing that federal regulators are basically ordering government, police, fire, school teacher pension funds, private pension funds.
[03:24:51.479 --> 03:24:56.163]  They're telling them to quote, invest in failed banking institutions.
[03:24:56.163 --> 03:24:58.845]  They're saying that your money markets won't be insured.
[03:24:58.845 --> 03:25:04.751]  They're definitely getting ready for a full financial controlled implosion.
[03:25:04.751 --> 03:25:11.276]  And I'm, Webster, I want to get into this now, then we'll come back and look at the big picture of where they're going on the world stage.
[03:25:11.276 --> 03:25:14.779]  But, you know, I've got all these articles here.
[03:25:17.825 --> 03:25:20.271]  CNN's doing a piece on me tonight.
[03:25:20.271 --> 03:25:21.494]  Am I causing violence?
[03:25:21.494 --> 03:25:22.296]  Am I dangerous?
[03:25:25.057 --> 03:25:29.260]  Military Husband Probe for Allegedly Posting Threats on Radical Website.
[03:25:29.260 --> 03:25:30.361]  Fox News.
[03:25:30.361 --> 03:25:31.481]  Infowars.com.
[03:25:31.481 --> 03:25:34.023]  It implies it's my fault.
[03:25:34.023 --> 03:25:38.246]  There's another headline where it says Alex Jones is causing all this.
[03:25:38.246 --> 03:25:42.929]  We've got all sorts of dirty tricks going on Webster that I don't want to get into on air.
[03:25:42.929 --> 03:25:47.432]  The point is London Guardian saying I'm the center of this anti-government black hole.
[03:25:47.432 --> 03:25:48.893]  I'm dangerous.
[03:25:48.893 --> 03:25:51.174]  Southern Poverty Law Center putting reports out every week.
[03:25:51.174 --> 03:25:54.497]  They say next month's issue is going to have me in the cover story.
[03:25:56.858 --> 03:25:59.920]  So, A, why do you... and I'm talking about protecting myself.
[03:25:59.920 --> 03:26:00.941]  I mean, I really want your opinion.
[03:26:00.941 --> 03:26:03.223]  It's not like, oh, look, I'm in the media.
[03:26:03.223 --> 03:26:04.263]  No, I mean, this is not fun.
[03:26:04.263 --> 03:26:09.907]  It's like having Hitler in 1939 giving speeches against you and you live in Berlin.
[03:26:09.907 --> 03:26:12.349]  I mean, it's creepy.
[03:26:12.349 --> 03:26:13.730]  But you've been fighting these people for 40 years.
[03:26:16.211 --> 03:26:18.412]  But not just the attack on Alex Jones.
[03:26:18.412 --> 03:26:24.374]  Clearly, these militia raids were set up, I predicted last year, with one of the militia members who was on.
[03:26:24.374 --> 03:26:27.595]  I said, I think you're a fraud, I think you're probably a government agent.
[03:26:27.595 --> 03:26:31.136]  I said, let me guess, you guys are training to attack the police station?
[03:26:31.136 --> 03:26:34.798]  And I said, if that's going on, that's the feds, because I've seen this
[03:26:35.851 --> 03:26:37.612]  Over and over again for so many reasons.
[03:26:37.612 --> 03:26:41.393]  They want to get the police hating the citizens.
[03:26:41.393 --> 03:26:43.974]  They say they want to attack a funeral possession.
[03:26:43.974 --> 03:26:47.175]  They think of the worst things they can think of.
[03:26:47.175 --> 03:26:56.179]  And I've had the military and police try to frame my cameraman in New York and at the G20 when they're just peacefully, nicely trying to interview him, Webster.
[03:26:57.259 --> 03:27:04.984]  The point is, why do you think they're coming after me in particular, and how is all this fear-mongering about militias?
[03:27:04.984 --> 03:27:08.186]  I mean, we know in 95 the Fed staged the Oklahoma City bombing.
[03:27:08.186 --> 03:27:08.466]  Go ahead.
[03:27:09.724 --> 03:27:18.227]  Well, on Broadway they say a knock is a boost, meaning that if you come under attack, this indicates that you're effective.
[03:27:18.227 --> 03:27:34.291]  So if we have an attack from somebody like Anderson Cooper, and as you pointed out, Anderson Cooper is this former CIA recruit, CIA trainee, and of course he's a Vanderbilt.
[03:27:34.291 --> 03:27:39.233]  He is the poor little rich boy who is the son of Gloria Vanderbilt, the heiress to this
[03:27:39.893 --> 03:27:42.094]  Fortune going back into the 19th century.
[03:27:42.094 --> 03:27:48.457]  So, to say that he's a rich elitist, a patrician aristocrat, I guess is putting it mildly.
[03:27:48.457 --> 03:27:52.159]  And of course, these are the resources of CNN.
[03:27:52.159 --> 03:27:57.542]  Back in the 1970s, this would have been a part of the picture that people had at the time.
[03:27:57.542 --> 03:28:03.305]  And it was quite clear that the CIA massively infiltrates the mass media.
[03:28:03.305 --> 03:28:04.926]  And this is a good example.
[03:28:04.926 --> 03:28:08.207]  So, this is coming from the intelligence agent.
[03:28:08.207 --> 03:28:09.068]  I guess you can say
[03:28:10.188 --> 03:28:32.162]  After this last weekend here with the Tea Party and the Peace Marchers coming to Washington, there's a huge hysteria of the Wall Street-controlled media, and they've decided to take, I think, really minor incidents that occurred at the Capitol, and make that into some kind of avalanche of hysteria.
[03:28:32.162 --> 03:28:37.045]  Well, let's talk about that when we come back, but specifically, why are they choosing me
[03:28:38.436 --> 03:28:48.887]  More and more, it's emerging that I am going to be the chief devil, that I'm being put on display, and they keep lying and saying I'm calling for violence, which is the opposite.
[03:28:48.887 --> 03:28:51.810]  Are they angry that I'm trying to stop violence?
[03:28:52.802 --> 03:29:01.245]  Absolutely, and this is just outrageous lying by them, because there's never been the breadth or any insinuation of this.
[03:29:01.245 --> 03:29:05.167]  This is absolutely fantastic, and they know it.
[03:29:05.167 --> 03:29:10.249]  And notice, as far as I can see, Anderson Cooper doesn't say, he doesn't accuse you directly.
[03:29:10.249 --> 03:29:12.930]  He does it through this sort of innuendo, right?
[03:29:12.930 --> 03:29:14.130]  Do you do this?
[03:29:14.130 --> 03:29:16.251]  Asking questions, right?
[03:29:16.251 --> 03:29:18.152]  Is it true that you beat your wife?
[03:29:18.152 --> 03:29:18.572]  This is the
[03:29:20.367 --> 03:29:22.709]  Well, they say all this violence is happening.
[03:29:22.709 --> 03:29:24.810]  Many people say that you're influencing this.
[03:29:24.810 --> 03:29:26.171]  What do you say to that?
[03:29:26.171 --> 03:29:30.975]  Many producers at CNN with CIA credentials say that.
[03:29:30.975 --> 03:29:32.095]  Well, this is ridiculous.
[03:29:32.095 --> 03:29:32.716]  Well, stay there.
[03:29:32.716 --> 03:29:35.658]  Let's come back and talk about how you think I should respond and how others should.
[03:29:35.658 --> 03:29:41.843]  And then for those that don't know what happened at the Capitol over the weekend, because we're not the only ones being demonized here, but it is creepy.
[03:29:42.583 --> 03:29:47.785]  I mean, that creepy, creepy, creepy Vanderbilt CIA operative up there.
[03:29:47.785 --> 03:29:49.145]  These people just make me sick.
[03:29:49.145 --> 03:29:51.746]  I mean, is there no end to their evil?
[03:29:51.746 --> 03:29:53.147]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.147 --> 03:29:55.668]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.668 --> 03:29:58.349]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.109 --> 03:30:03.431]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:30:03.431 --> 03:30:05.814]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:30:05.814 --> 03:30:09.017]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:30:09.017 --> 03:30:14.142]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:30:14.142 --> 03:30:18.327]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:30:18.627 --> 03:30:20.989]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:30:20.989 --> 03:30:23.872]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:30:23.872 --> 03:30:26.795]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:30:26.795 --> 03:30:34.402]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:30:34.727 --> 03:30:40.111]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:30:40.111 --> 03:30:42.433]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:30:42.433 --> 03:30:46.656]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:30:46.656 --> 03:30:47.716]  And I got news for you.
[03:30:47.716 --> 03:30:49.077]  You're everyone else.
[03:30:49.077 --> 03:30:50.559]  Invisible Empire.

[03:32:01.030 --> 03:32:01.831]  Hi, everyone.
[03:32:01.831 --> 03:32:02.872]  Andy Anderson here.
[03:32:02.872 --> 03:32:07.297]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[03:32:07.297 --> 03:32:13.083]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[03:32:13.083 --> 03:32:17.427]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, good-bye effectiveness?
[03:32:17.427 --> 03:32:19.129]  No more protection until you use it again.
[03:32:19.269 --> 03:32:20.629]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[03:32:20.629 --> 03:32:25.010]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[03:32:25.010 --> 03:32:27.211]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[03:32:27.211 --> 03:32:40.274]  PureWorks disinfecting spray is EPA certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria, molds and fungus too.
[03:32:40.274 --> 03:32:41.834]  It's even safe around pets and children.
[03:32:41.914 --> 03:32:45.095]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[03:32:45.095 --> 03:32:46.276]  No more dry skin.
[03:32:46.276 --> 03:32:50.858]  Here's to a little peace of mind knowing that your hands are still germ-free hours later.
[03:32:50.858 --> 03:32:55.640]  Call now toll-free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on PureWorks and get PureWorks on your hands.
[03:32:55.640 --> 03:32:55.860]  That's 888-245-0300.
[03:33:27.013 --> 03:33:33.377]  We are picking Webster Tarpley's brain on a host of important issues.
[03:33:33.377 --> 03:33:36.759]  Why are they choosing to demonize the Tea Parties?
[03:33:36.759 --> 03:33:42.583]  I mean, I see the Republicans coming in and setting the parameters of what the Tea Party should
[03:33:43.624 --> 03:33:53.595]  Should be in their image pro-war, pro-patriot act, torture, police state, and the Republicans, well they might save us in a few years if we vote them into power.
[03:33:53.595 --> 03:33:56.378]  That way the power structure stays intact.
[03:33:56.378 --> 03:33:56.898]  Meanwhile,
[03:33:57.790 --> 03:34:01.493]  I would say it has to do with the crisis in the political system after the passage of this Obamacare.
[03:34:21.787 --> 03:34:33.975]  It's because you are one of the leading public figures who is able to escape this rigid ideological dichotomy, this so-called left-right split.
[03:34:33.975 --> 03:34:47.184]  That is to say, there's a convergence of elements that are considered conservative with elements that are left-wing that could become the basis for challenging the Democratic and Republican parties.
[03:34:51.967 --> 03:34:52.247]  We're good.
[03:35:08.152 --> 03:35:11.834]  Raises your taxes, lowers the standards of care.
[03:35:11.834 --> 03:35:13.835]  This doesn't have your public option.
[03:35:13.835 --> 03:35:17.037]  Now the left wakes up and you show the right wing that.
[03:35:17.037 --> 03:35:21.479]  I've noticed Limbaugh and others always say the insurance companies are good, they were against this.
[03:35:21.479 --> 03:35:27.362]  So it shatters that deception and brings the people together in a populist movement against the bankers.
[03:35:27.362 --> 03:35:33.025]  And I continue to call for going after the banking structure, not going after just puppets like Obama.
[03:35:33.712 --> 03:35:38.636]  Exactly, and I think there's a sense that the time for this may be ripe.
[03:35:38.636 --> 03:35:52.948]  If you look at the response in the left wing of the Democratic Party, so to speak, to this betrayal on the healthcare, you see that, you know, Congressman Kucinich folded, he voted for it, the progressive caucus, they all voted for it.
[03:35:53.448 --> 03:35:59.269]  For Obama, of course, they were all terrorized by Rahm Emanuel and that machine operating out of the White House.
[03:35:59.269 --> 03:36:16.453]  If you look, though, at this blog called Fire Dog Lake, written by Jane Hampshire, who was, I guess, a somewhat reluctant supporter of Obama back in 2008, she comes on saying that if you look at the Obama health plan, it is close to the dictionary definition of fascism.
[03:36:16.453 --> 03:36:19.234]  In other words, the fascist corporate state.
[03:36:19.234 --> 03:36:20.454]  Now, I think on that basis,
[03:36:21.014 --> 03:36:36.580]  You could say the time may be ripe for a convergence of political forces outside the Democratic and Republican parties that would be anti-war, anti-dictatorship, anti-Wall Street, anti-Federal Reserve.
[03:36:36.580 --> 03:36:40.582]  And I think that's a convergence that is now possible.
[03:36:40.582 --> 03:36:47.405]  I would just say that would then have to become not just anti, but also in favor of something, and specifically this.
[03:36:47.945 --> 03:36:50.549]  We're now in a world economic depression.
[03:36:50.549 --> 03:37:01.544]  If we look back to the 1930s, in the most general terms, we went from depression to dictatorship, in Germany especially, but also elsewhere, and then we had a world war.
[03:37:01.544 --> 03:37:04.669]  So what we've got to do is to prevent this depression
[03:37:05.349 --> 03:37:08.050]  And clearly they've been setting up for this for decades.
[03:37:08.050 --> 03:37:10.990]  This is premeditated, but that's the next issue.
[03:37:10.990 --> 03:37:12.631]  We'll talk about some solutions, Webster.
[03:37:12.631 --> 03:37:14.431]  I know you have your opinion on those.
[03:37:14.431 --> 03:37:16.191]  My question here for you, though, is
[03:37:35.089 --> 03:37:42.255]  The system is ignoring any reforms that would actually fix the country and then there wouldn't be a need for a dictatorship from their view.
[03:37:42.255 --> 03:37:44.477]  But they want this austerity.
[03:37:44.477 --> 03:37:46.559]  The Federal Reserve heads are out pushing it.
[03:37:46.559 --> 03:37:49.541]  They want to make us poppers so we're more easily managed.
[03:37:49.541 --> 03:37:51.162]  They brag about it.
[03:37:51.162 --> 03:37:52.343]  They talk about it.
[03:37:52.343 --> 03:37:55.926]  Their whole eugenics, you know, fake environmental movement.
[03:37:55.926 --> 03:37:57.468]  And that's in big trouble.
[03:37:57.468 --> 03:38:03.393]  And so I think this acceleration of authoritarian systems that were already growing and in place
[03:38:04.193 --> 03:38:05.414]  Is an act of desperation.
[03:38:05.414 --> 03:38:06.374]  Clearly that's happening.
[03:38:06.374 --> 03:38:08.795]  All the poll numbers on every issue show that.
[03:38:08.795 --> 03:38:12.836]  And this dictatorship of these plutocrats is now coming out.
[03:38:12.836 --> 03:38:14.257]  But the system doesn't care.
[03:38:14.257 --> 03:38:19.158]  And I see trial balloons in the Wall Street Journal, in Bloomberg, in World Net Daily.
[03:38:19.158 --> 03:38:26.821]  They're admitting, okay, the regulators that have control over these pension funds with federal power, they're saying, invest in bad banks.
[03:38:26.821 --> 03:38:29.202]  They're not saying invest in some great government program.
[03:38:29.202 --> 03:38:31.143]  They're saying, you will prop up the banks.
[03:38:32.204 --> 03:38:34.368]  And so where do you see that going?
[03:38:35.083 --> 03:38:43.707]  Well, the people who are told to do this have to say no, and above all the people that are stakeholders, meaning the people whose money is involved have got to say no.
[03:38:43.707 --> 03:38:57.514]  I would say the single most important question right now is the anti-Wall Street, because I think that's the universal common denominator that just about everybody can share, and there's no political force that embodies this.
[03:38:57.514 --> 03:38:59.355]  There's nobody willing to take it on.
[03:38:59.355 --> 03:39:03.337]  I went to see the Tea Party here at Capitol Hill ten days ago.
[03:39:03.917 --> 03:39:07.539]  And what you find is that the Tea Party, I think, has been purged.
[03:39:07.539 --> 03:39:10.921]  What you find there are people who are, quite frankly, Republicans.
[03:39:10.921 --> 03:39:22.446]  They sit there, they listen to Republican members of the Congress and Republican operatives and Republican think tankers from, you know, all different Republican lobbying institutions and whatever.
[03:39:22.446 --> 03:39:26.028]  And then when you talk to the people in the Tea Party, it's actually funny.
[03:39:26.843 --> 03:39:45.441]  A lot of them are retired military, and most of them have a government pension, and they have either veterans TRICARE or they have Veterans Administration pensions, and you get the idea that they're there saying, I have my piece of the federal budget, I don't want anybody else to get a piece for themselves at my expense.
[03:39:45.441 --> 03:39:50.747]  So, the thing is that Palin said the Republican Party ought to absorb
[03:39:51.287 --> 03:39:51.987]  The Tea Party.
[03:39:51.987 --> 03:39:53.948]  Well, that's what they're trying to do.
[03:39:53.948 --> 03:39:57.110]  I would not say that the Tea Party is only demonized.
[03:39:57.110 --> 03:40:00.351]  They're also giving huge, huge publicity.
[03:40:00.351 --> 03:40:03.692]  Because I think the... Yeah, but that's double-edged.
[03:40:03.692 --> 03:40:09.555]  Because then they appoint the Republicanized, Republicanoid Tea Party.
[03:40:11.289 --> 03:40:17.953]  They take it over, but then separately in the left-right paradigm, they then also make it the polar opposite.
[03:40:17.953 --> 03:40:22.596]  So it's the savior to some, the devil to others, but again, it's within a controlled system.
[03:40:22.944 --> 03:40:24.084]  Absolutely controlled.
[03:40:24.084 --> 03:40:30.005]  And remember, I think the big problem on the horizon is this General Petraeus and Mitt Romney.
[03:40:30.005 --> 03:40:31.846]  General Petraeus for President.
[03:40:31.846 --> 03:40:38.827]  If General Petraeus comes out for President, he'll immediately get what's left of the Tea Party, which again are mostly retired military.
[03:40:38.827 --> 03:40:41.367]  This was the overwhelming majority of the group.
[03:40:41.367 --> 03:40:52.029]  And then Romney, with his best-selling book and his ideas about austerity, Romney is now intervening in the senatorial race in Utah.
[03:40:52.529 --> 03:40:55.693]  Supporting Bennett, who's under fire, right?
[03:40:55.693 --> 03:40:56.994]  The Republican Senator.
[03:40:56.994 --> 03:40:59.778]  And saying, Bennett voted for the bailout.
[03:40:59.778 --> 03:41:01.239]  The bailout was a good thing.
[03:41:01.239 --> 03:41:03.542]  We had to give the money to the banks.
[03:41:03.542 --> 03:41:07.426]  Support Bennett because he stood by the banks when the going got tough.
[03:41:07.426 --> 03:41:08.868]  So you get the idea.
[03:41:08.868 --> 03:41:11.211]  This would become a Wall Street dictatorship.
[03:41:11.471 --> 03:41:21.518]  Well, that's why we see the Republicans going after Rand Paul in Kentucky, who looks like he's going to win, letting the head of elections run for Senate and run his own election.
[03:41:21.518 --> 03:41:24.820]  I mean, just unprecedented.
[03:41:24.820 --> 03:41:29.163]  And you've got Palin supporting John McCain, who was pro-bailout.
[03:41:29.163 --> 03:41:36.788]  So clearly, I guess that's why I'm being targeted, because I don't want the banks to fully suck this country dry.
[03:41:37.762 --> 03:41:41.464]  Yes, and certainly Palin, of course, was pro-bailout herself.
[03:41:41.464 --> 03:41:44.486]  She was directly involved.
[03:41:44.486 --> 03:41:53.492]  So I think that the position that you occupy in this spectrum is you defy this splitting, right?
[03:41:53.492 --> 03:41:56.213]  The wedge issues, essentially, because that's what they are.
[03:41:56.213 --> 03:41:58.615]  You're above the wedge issues and you're offering
[03:41:59.455 --> 03:42:14.836]  A critique of this entire false flag terrorism, this hysteria, the crude provocations that are dished up now every week or every month we've got a new false flag terror event completely fictitious.
[03:42:14.836 --> 03:42:15.898]  The thing I would say though is
[03:42:17.153 --> 03:42:23.496]  The people that are in your audience have got to ask themselves, how long can this depression go on?
[03:42:23.496 --> 03:42:25.037]  How many more years of depression?
[03:42:25.037 --> 03:42:38.042]  How many more years of 15, 20 million people without jobs, 25 million, real unemployment probably 20%, maybe 25% if it's really bad.
[03:42:38.042 --> 03:42:40.323]  How long can you go on with this and still keep
[03:42:40.883 --> 03:42:42.925]  The institutions of representative government.
[03:42:42.925 --> 03:42:52.593]  You know, 80 years ago today, 80 years ago, on 30th of March 1930 in Germany, we had the coming of Heinrich Bluming, who was an austerity dictator.
[03:42:52.593 --> 03:43:00.380]  He's the kind of thing that's being prepared in the state of New York, and indeed what Obama will turn into next year according to the current scenarios.
[03:43:01.580 --> 03:43:10.302]  Once you get this kind of austerity going on, right, everything is cut, your pension is taken away, all the social spending is looted.
[03:43:10.302 --> 03:43:12.843]  I mean, look at Obama's health plan.
[03:43:12.843 --> 03:43:26.687]  It loots $500 billion out of Medicare, it loots Medicaid, it loots TRICARE, it loots everything to give bigger and better bailouts, in this case, to insurance companies.
[03:43:26.687 --> 03:43:27.487]  At this point, though,
[03:43:28.007 --> 03:43:30.269]  We have to have a recovery program.
[03:43:30.269 --> 03:43:33.511]  In other words, a positive program.
[03:43:33.511 --> 03:43:34.172]  What to do?
[03:43:34.172 --> 03:43:36.213]  In other words, what do you stand for?
[03:43:36.213 --> 03:43:41.657]  Obviously the anti-war, anti-dictatorship, anti-Wall Street, anti-Federal Reserve.
[03:43:41.657 --> 03:43:43.619]  But then, some kind of a plan.
[03:43:44.019 --> 03:43:45.500]  At least the basic outline.
[03:43:45.500 --> 03:43:47.302]  How do you get out of a depression?
[03:43:47.302 --> 03:43:50.664]  Because the trick with a depression is you don't get out of it automatically.
[03:43:50.664 --> 03:43:51.525]  There's no cycle.
[03:43:51.525 --> 03:43:53.487]  There's nothing that's going to lift you out of it.
[03:43:53.487 --> 03:43:56.229]  You have to change policies to get out of it.
[03:43:56.229 --> 03:44:00.572]  And history teaches that can't be simply cutting everything.
[03:44:00.572 --> 03:44:02.254]  Because the more you cut these budgets,
[03:44:02.958 --> 03:44:12.342]  The more, you're going to have a bigger deficit in the coming year because if you go to New Jersey, right, the Governor of Christy of New Jersey is firing all the public workers.
[03:44:12.342 --> 03:44:13.782]  That's just great.
[03:44:13.782 --> 03:44:16.663]  All of those people right now are paying taxes.
[03:44:16.663 --> 03:44:19.264]  Once they're fired, they're not paying taxes anymore.
[03:44:19.264 --> 03:44:20.725]  They're demanding unemployment benefits.
[03:44:20.965 --> 03:44:22.286]  But that always happens.
[03:44:22.286 --> 03:44:31.431]  First they communalize the wealth, they get everybody addicted to it, then they remove all the services, the taxes go up, and whatever's left goes to the banks.
[03:44:31.431 --> 03:44:43.157]  And I want to get into that in just a moment, Webster, but before we run out of time here, you talked about how the Republicans have come in in a bullish manner, taking over the tea parties.
[03:44:43.157 --> 03:44:43.898]  Here's a clip.
[03:44:45.316 --> 03:45:05.927]  From a Libertarian over the weekend at a Palin rally, what this was in Phoenix, and all the guy does is stand up and say, you're pro-war, you were pro-banker bailout, that's what the newspaper reported, the TV only caught the part where they tackle him, and Tea Partiers tackle him, are jumping on his head, and the police run over, and
[03:45:08.502 --> 03:45:16.989]  Basically, assault him and help the people that are going after him.
[03:45:16.989 --> 03:45:19.591]  And then they drag him out and arrest him.
[03:45:19.591 --> 03:45:26.596]  So, you know, the same thing happened to me back in 98 when I asked George Bush a question at the end of a speech at a press conference.
[03:45:26.596 --> 03:45:30.319]  They didn't like it, so they drug me out and arrested me and then later released me.
[03:45:30.319 --> 03:45:34.662]  But, I mean, this is the liberty, this is the freedom of the Tea Partiers?
[03:45:34.662 --> 03:45:35.083]  Here it is.
[03:45:43.717 --> 03:45:45.998]  All right.
[03:46:01.554 --> 03:46:08.140]  And it just continues from the news with screaming, this is from ABC 15, continue playing it.
[03:46:08.140 --> 03:46:09.261]  Who are you?
[03:46:09.261 --> 03:46:10.742]  What is your guys' problem?
[03:46:10.742 --> 03:46:12.544]  You're a douche, that's our problem!
[03:46:12.544 --> 03:46:14.826]  Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[03:46:14.826 --> 03:46:15.967]  I hate Obama!
[03:46:15.967 --> 03:46:17.368]  I don't like Obama!
[03:46:17.368 --> 03:46:19.029]  I'm a libertarian!
[03:46:19.029 --> 03:46:21.792]  I'm supporting America!
[03:46:21.792 --> 03:46:22.993]  What is your guys' issue?
[03:46:24.881 --> 03:46:31.407]  Sir, any thoughts about even speaking out at a rally that you clearly know are McCain-impaled and people are there for a statewide race?
[03:46:31.407 --> 03:46:33.368]  Why use this opportunity to try to say anything?
[03:46:33.368 --> 03:46:35.951]  I'm trying to save America.
[03:46:35.951 --> 03:46:36.711]  I like America.
[03:46:36.711 --> 03:46:38.193]  I like Americans.
[03:46:38.193 --> 03:46:41.035]  I just don't like John McCain.
[03:46:41.035 --> 03:46:42.897]  And what happened in there once you started speaking out?
[03:46:49.281 --> 03:46:50.581]  What's your name?
[03:46:50.581 --> 03:46:55.243]  Sir, what's your name?
[03:46:55.243 --> 03:46:57.403]  You have no right to ask me for my name.
[03:46:57.403 --> 03:46:59.364]  This is a public event.
[03:46:59.364 --> 03:47:02.245]  I have my rights.
[03:47:02.245 --> 03:47:02.945]  I don't like Obama.
[03:47:02.945 --> 03:47:03.825]  I don't like McCain.
[03:47:03.825 --> 03:47:08.327]  I like Ron Paul.
[03:47:08.327 --> 03:47:10.187]  And what was your plan?
[03:47:10.187 --> 03:47:12.568]  I have family in the war.
[03:47:12.568 --> 03:47:13.428]  They know it's corrupt.
[03:47:13.428 --> 03:47:15.869]  I have a cousin that moved to Canberra.
[03:47:17.534 --> 03:47:20.196]  He went to an open public event at a big school auditorium.
[03:47:20.196 --> 03:47:21.357]  He goes in.
[03:47:21.357 --> 03:47:24.119]  He's not a liberal.
[03:47:24.119 --> 03:47:25.140]  He's not a conservative.
[03:47:25.140 --> 03:47:25.900]  He is a patriot.
[03:47:25.900 --> 03:47:27.381]  He's a Ron Paul type supporter.
[03:47:46.796 --> 03:47:57.843]  And in America, the other citizens don't want to hear him stand up and say, you know, you're pro-war, you were for the bailout, and that's what was reported he said.
[03:47:57.843 --> 03:48:04.027]  So they tackle him and are jumping up and down on him, assaulting him, and the police come over and say, this is good.
[03:48:04.787 --> 03:48:07.029]  Let us help you, jump on his head.
[03:48:07.029 --> 03:48:08.650]  Let's drag him out.
[03:48:08.650 --> 03:48:12.433]  And the reporter's acting like, what did you think he was going to get out of this?
[03:48:12.433 --> 03:48:14.354]  This is living in a tyranny.
[03:48:14.354 --> 03:48:16.196]  Where the public is sick, mentally.
[03:48:16.196 --> 03:48:18.197]  You know, like, don't taser me, bro.
[03:48:18.197 --> 03:48:19.638]  The guy a few years ago wasn't even resisting.
[03:48:19.638 --> 03:48:21.460]  He's going, why are you doing this?
[03:48:21.460 --> 03:48:23.061]  You know, Kerry was even letting him finish.
[03:48:23.061 --> 03:48:24.342]  Let him finish his question.
[03:48:24.342 --> 03:48:25.523]  They're like, no!
[03:48:25.523 --> 03:48:28.225]  And now you're on the ground, we're going to taser you three times.
[03:48:28.225 --> 03:48:30.206]  And you watch him getting off on it.
[03:48:30.206 --> 03:48:31.447]  This is fascism.
[03:48:31.447 --> 03:48:32.428]  This is tyranny.
[03:48:35.482 --> 03:48:39.283]  Just to watch the sickness of these people.
[03:48:39.283 --> 03:48:43.564]  So if this is a solution to Obama, it's more of the same, Webster Tarpley.
[03:48:43.564 --> 03:48:45.225]  I think it's very interesting.
[03:48:45.225 --> 03:49:02.209]  The line in the Tea Party between the authentic and honest people and the ones that are of no use for anything is the honest ones will all say, I'm against the Republican Party, I'm against the Democratic Party, I reject both.
[03:49:02.209 --> 03:49:03.549]  This is the beginning of wisdom.
[03:49:04.289 --> 03:49:20.956]  But what I found on Capitol Hill ten days ago, in this demonstration right before the health bill was rammed through, was that most of them would say, well, I'm for the Republicans, I'm much closer to the Republicans, I'm not interested in third parties, and so forth.
[03:49:20.956 --> 03:49:22.457]  So I think that's what it is.
[03:49:22.457 --> 03:49:28.980]  On the left side, though, the people out there who really gave Obama his victory in the primaries
[03:49:29.800 --> 03:49:34.321]  They're very, very angry because of the escalation in Afghanistan.
[03:49:34.321 --> 03:49:38.362]  You've got this health bill, which... But Webster, let's go back.
[03:49:38.362 --> 03:49:40.643]  I mean, let's go back though here.
[03:49:40.643 --> 03:49:51.185]  What about the brown shirt image of a public rally, the guy gets up, and what they would call heckles, and so they basically beat him up, and then he still gets arrested.
[03:49:51.185 --> 03:49:52.546]  This is the essence of 1938 brown shirts.
[03:49:54.602 --> 03:49:58.223]  Yeah, it's outrageous, obviously, and there's no place for this.
[03:49:58.223 --> 03:50:15.087]  What is missing is an organized force, that is a third party or something leading to a third party, that would have an economic recovery program, as well as these points about no to the war, defend civil liberties, defend obvious democratic rights.
[03:50:15.587 --> 03:50:23.235]  Stop this Wall Street domination and seize and nationalize the Federal Reserve and rip that out of the hands of Wall Street.
[03:50:23.235 --> 03:50:29.861]  What I'm trying to point to is right now, the public disgust with both parties is extremely strong.
[03:50:29.861 --> 03:50:38.150]  And I would say there are people in the ruling elite who say, well, anybody who's prominent like yourself could become a pole of rallying.
[03:50:38.750 --> 03:50:40.931]  Let's talk about where the country's going economically.
[03:51:02.148 --> 03:51:03.069]  You worry.
[03:51:03.069 --> 03:51:05.090]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[03:51:05.090 --> 03:51:07.631]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[03:51:07.631 --> 03:51:09.732]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[03:51:09.732 --> 03:51:11.333]  Your answer may be at hand.
[03:51:11.333 --> 03:51:14.935]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[03:51:14.935 --> 03:51:20.178]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[03:51:20.178 --> 03:51:23.480]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[03:51:23.976 --> 03:51:25.657]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[03:51:25.657 --> 03:51:28.518]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[03:51:28.518 --> 03:51:31.819]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[03:51:31.819 --> 03:51:40.262]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[03:51:40.262 --> 03:51:44.943]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[03:52:19.116 --> 03:52:25.803]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:52:25.803 --> 03:52:31.769]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:52:31.769 --> 03:52:35.953]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[03:52:35.953 --> 03:52:40.257]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:52:40.257 --> 03:52:43.040]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,
[03:52:43.460 --> 03:52:46.182]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:52:46.182 --> 03:52:49.723]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:52:49.723 --> 03:52:51.705]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:52:51.705 --> 03:52:52.825]  It's here.

[03:53:01.076 --> 03:53:04.599]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[03:53:04.599 --> 03:53:06.600]  Now, going green can save money.
[03:53:06.600 --> 03:53:12.164]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[03:53:12.164 --> 03:53:20.189]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[03:53:20.189 --> 03:53:29.496]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives.
[03:53:29.736 --> 03:53:30.317]  We're good to go!
[03:53:58.717 --> 03:54:04.358]  You know what's frustrating?
[03:54:04.358 --> 03:54:12.620]  I have never sold out to the New World Order.
[03:54:30.558 --> 03:54:33.459]  And I did it because I wanted to be honest.
[03:54:33.459 --> 03:54:36.460]  I wanted to stand up against their evil.
[03:54:36.460 --> 03:54:42.302]  I understood that historically, if my children and their progeny are going to have any future, I have to do this.
[03:54:42.302 --> 03:54:50.584]  But you don't just get shot out of the media and demonized and not be as successful reaching people if you don't play ball.
[03:54:50.584 --> 03:54:53.085]  Then sometimes they come and put you in prison and kill you.
[03:54:53.085 --> 03:54:56.506]  But then that just illustrates even more why we have to beat these people.
[03:54:56.506 --> 03:54:59.327]  And the good news is they're in trouble on every front.
[03:55:01.169 --> 03:55:10.671]  And a lot of people in the system who are in denial about the level of authoritarian system we're going into, it's a big wake-up call.
[03:55:10.671 --> 03:55:18.132]  And it's just time for people to stop going along with this and for people in government to start saying no.
[03:55:18.132 --> 03:55:27.174]  I mean, school kids being watched at home off school-issued laptops, torture, secret arrest, legislation.
[03:55:28.496 --> 03:55:29.959]  To secretly arrest U.S.
[03:55:29.959 --> 03:55:31.281]  citizens and torture them?
[03:55:41.892 --> 03:55:43.774]  There is an awakening taking place.
[03:55:43.774 --> 03:55:47.217]  The question is, will it be hard enough, fast enough?
[03:55:47.217 --> 03:55:49.440]  Webster Tarbley, where do you see the economy going?
[03:55:49.440 --> 03:55:53.284]  There's no doubt it's now a double-dip recession, a new stupid term.
[03:55:53.284 --> 03:55:56.207]  We're really in a depression.
[03:55:56.207 --> 03:55:59.390]  The globalists are in trouble on every front, but they don't seem to care, Webster.
[03:56:00.345 --> 03:56:01.987]  Oh, I think they care very much.
[03:56:01.987 --> 03:56:08.553]  We've had Iceland voting 92% to say no to the bankers of London and Amsterdam.
[03:56:08.553 --> 03:56:12.076]  We had the Greek labor movement staging two general strikes.
[03:56:12.076 --> 03:56:15.119]  We had a general strike in Italy, too, on top of that.
[03:56:15.119 --> 03:56:19.302]  And we've got the hundred campuses in the United States blowing up over this issue of
[03:56:20.123 --> 03:56:26.330]  Drastic increases in the tuition at state colleges from California to New York City.
[03:56:26.330 --> 03:56:30.975]  And the system knows it's only going to get worse, so what's their plan to try to block this?
[03:56:30.975 --> 03:56:37.241]  When I say they don't care, they do care, but they're committed to their program and they know they're pushing people to the boiling point.
[03:56:37.842 --> 03:56:40.784]  Their program is budget cuts that kill people.
[03:56:40.784 --> 03:56:45.147]  What you say, the repressive side of the current regime, it's clear.
[03:56:45.147 --> 03:56:47.548]  But that goes together with what they're taking away from you.
[03:56:47.548 --> 03:56:49.610]  They're taking away your economic rights.
[03:56:49.610 --> 03:56:55.594]  They want to deprive you of whatever pension, healthcare, job, unemployment benefits and so forth that you have.
[03:56:55.594 --> 03:56:57.035]  The tremendous pressure right now is
[03:56:57.755 --> 03:57:00.436]  We have the states across the U.S.
[03:57:00.436 --> 03:57:04.658]  and the larger municipalities have a combined deficit of $400 billion.
[03:57:04.658 --> 03:57:13.921]  So what you see is Christie in New Jersey, McDonnell in Virginia, Schwarzenegger, the Democrat governor in Illinois, Ryan.
[03:57:14.830 --> 03:57:26.313]  Austerity, cuts, fire state workers, reduce the salaries of state workers if you can, gouge, chisel, and ultimately that will kill people.
[03:57:26.313 --> 03:57:33.735]  That actually leads to greater losses of human life than the kind of police state violence.
[03:57:33.735 --> 03:57:35.115]  Where's Obama in a year?
[03:57:36.420 --> 03:57:42.225]  Well Obama next year, see at the end of this, we've reached the end of the stimulus phase.
[03:57:42.225 --> 03:57:46.068]  Now we're supposed to have now the, we're going to go back to deficit reduction.
[03:57:46.068 --> 03:57:48.770]  So Obama is transitioning into his role.
[03:57:48.770 --> 03:57:55.096]  He thinks that he can be the austerity dictator and of course that's very hard because of the way his base is set up.
[03:57:55.536 --> 03:58:06.240]  But in 2011, Obama's going to come on the scene, probably with a Republican Congress in at least one house, and he's going to say, I will get the budget back in balance.
[03:58:06.240 --> 03:58:07.481]  I will make the cuts.
[03:58:07.481 --> 03:58:10.122]  And the way that he does it is by union busting.
[03:58:10.122 --> 03:58:13.083]  Remember when Reagan busted the air traffic controllers?
[03:58:13.083 --> 03:58:15.724]  Obama is busting the teachers' union right now.
[03:58:16.184 --> 03:58:17.765]  All right, Webster, we're out of time.
[03:58:17.765 --> 03:58:19.726]  We'll have you back very soon.
[03:58:19.726 --> 03:58:20.726]  You've got four books.
[03:58:20.726 --> 03:58:23.727]  We sell them all at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:23.727 --> 03:58:25.888]  Two books on Obama and a lot more.
[03:58:25.888 --> 03:58:27.369]  We really appreciate you spending time with us.
[03:58:27.369 --> 03:58:29.010]  See you soon, Alex.
[03:58:29.010 --> 03:58:29.470]  You bet.
[03:58:29.470 --> 03:58:31.291]  Man, these are times that try men's souls.
[03:58:31.291 --> 03:58:32.231]  Please pray for us.
[03:58:32.231 --> 03:58:37.093]  Keep spreading the word about the show, the free iPhone app, and we got two new films coming out next month.
[03:58:37.093 --> 03:58:39.355]  Pre-order them both at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:39.355 --> 03:58:40.095]  Great job, crew.
