[00:00.000 --> 00:13.280]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:13.280 --> 00:14.280]  And forworth.com.
[00:14.280 --> 00:27.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:27.000 --> 00:40.600]  There's Speed Go, the London Guardian, the Financial Times of London, CBS News, The New
[00:40.600 --> 00:51.320]  York Times, all of them today and in previous days are writing multiple stories misrepresenting
[00:51.320 --> 00:55.960]  what infowars.com is reporting.
[00:55.960 --> 01:00.760]  And they are misrepresenting what the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, is saying.
[01:00.760 --> 01:04.480]  They're misrepresenting what Ted Cruz, Texas Senator, is saying.
[01:04.480 --> 01:11.320]  They're misrepresenting what Congressman Louis Gohmert of Texas is saying.
[01:11.320 --> 01:15.280]  Because this is all they can do is misrepresent and run dirty tricks.
[01:15.280 --> 01:22.800]  They can't have a square upfront debate with the people.
[01:22.800 --> 01:26.440]  And quite frankly, I'm just tired of it.
[01:26.440 --> 01:34.680]  Number one, we're going to break down the deception of this week with George Stephanophilus,
[01:34.680 --> 01:36.880]  the former Clinton chief of staff.
[01:36.880 --> 01:42.640]  I mean, need I say more?
[01:42.640 --> 01:45.840]  When we come back after this break.
[01:45.840 --> 01:52.200]  But they called us on Tuesday and they said to my producer, yeah, we want to get Alex
[01:52.200 --> 01:57.760]  Jones on live and I said to Nika, I said, agree to it, but say only live.
[01:57.760 --> 02:03.800]  We have all the emails right here and I said, but watch.
[02:03.800 --> 02:15.120]  I said, prepare yourself because by Friday, they're going to say, oh, sorry, it's taped.
[02:15.120 --> 02:19.600]  Then I said, when we refuse to do it, they're going to ask us if we're afraid.
[02:19.600 --> 02:21.880]  They did all that.
[02:21.880 --> 02:25.360]  Nika, who's worked here about three years though, but now runs a lot of the setting
[02:25.360 --> 02:26.360]  me up for media interviews.
[02:26.360 --> 02:29.720]  He said, I can't believe they did exactly what you said they do because I've been doing
[02:29.720 --> 02:30.720]  this 20 years.
[02:30.720 --> 02:35.960]  I mean, I was on ABC News, CBS News, I was on Good Morning America like 18 years ago.
[02:35.960 --> 02:37.120]  I've been on the view.
[02:37.120 --> 02:40.320]  I've been on Fox 20 something times, CNN 20 something times.
[02:40.320 --> 02:43.280]  I mean, you name it, I've done it.
[02:43.280 --> 02:47.440]  And they just want to claim they tried to interview you as a prop and I said, there's
[02:47.440 --> 02:52.560]  a chance they're going to like not have the car show up right or whatever to pick me up
[02:52.560 --> 02:57.200]  because they demand to send a car for their guests as if you're under their control.
[02:57.200 --> 03:01.120]  A lot of people on the info or comments saying, why'd you want a car, Mr. Fancy pants?
[03:01.120 --> 03:02.120]  That's what they do.
[03:02.120 --> 03:07.140]  So they have the guests, you know, in their hands actually make sense of somebody's
[03:07.140 --> 03:10.280]  funded New York to be on some show and New York's a big city.
[03:10.280 --> 03:16.520]  You send it basically a taxi cab to get a black taxi cab proto Uber, early Uber type
[03:16.520 --> 03:21.800]  system that have 50 years and it's not about Alex Jones, you know, this show, I don't
[03:21.800 --> 03:25.960]  want to make it about me and what's happened to me, but what's happening to us is a micro
[03:25.960 --> 03:31.120] cosm and a roadmap, a textbook to understand the different dirty tricks.
[03:31.120 --> 03:39.920]  These people are basically running.
[03:39.920 --> 03:47.920]  So then Saturday, my producer calls me Nico Costa and he says, yeah, sure enough, they
[03:47.920 --> 03:51.880]  want you to show up at 615 there to tape something for a nine o'clock show.
[03:51.880 --> 03:54.000]  I said, no, it's a five minute segment.
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.120]  We're just doing that to mess with me.
[03:56.120 --> 03:58.960]  This has happened probably 30 times over the years.
[03:58.960 --> 04:03.160]  They will end up just getting me up early to mess with me.
[04:03.160 --> 04:08.600]  This is kind of dirty tricks they run and then never airing it or canceling when I get
[04:08.600 --> 04:12.240]  there to the studio, the satellite studio.
[04:12.240 --> 04:14.120]  That's a favorite tactic of CNN.
[04:14.120 --> 04:20.600]  They've done that to me probably seven, eight times, but not in the last 10 years or so
[04:20.600 --> 04:25.360]  because I just refuse to be part of it.
[04:25.360 --> 04:33.840]  You notice I was in studio live with Pierce Morgan and sure enough, I get up this morning
[04:33.840 --> 04:39.640]  and I walk around on my robe cooking breakfast for the kids and stuff and I'd even stayed
[04:39.640 --> 04:42.120]  in town so that I could be closer to the studio.
[04:42.120 --> 04:50.120]  I live outside town most of the time and 12 minutes for airtime before 9 a.m. when it's
[04:50.120 --> 04:53.880]  live, they call and go, there's a car downstairs.
[04:53.880 --> 04:56.080]  Also they could say I chickened out and didn't show up.
[04:56.080 --> 04:59.680]  I mean, this is the type of theater these people engage in.
[04:59.680 --> 05:04.440]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems, introducing
[05:04.440 --> 05:10.160]  the new InfoWarsLife.com, oil of oregano formulation, we have now procured the most high quality
[05:10.160 --> 05:16.120]  and potent forms of oregano oil on the market, extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed
[05:16.120 --> 05:20.440]  in easy to use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano
[05:20.440 --> 05:21.440]  on the tongue.
[05:21.440 --> 05:25.960]  Now available in our limited first run at InfoWarsLife.com, that's InfoWarsLife.com
[05:25.960 --> 05:29.280]  or call 888-253-3139.
[05:29.280 --> 05:30.280]  Alex Jones here.
[05:30.280 --> 05:34.640]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist and chemist
[05:34.640 --> 05:40.160]  to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life changing health benefits, introducing
[05:40.160 --> 05:45.640]  the all new ancient defense herbal immunity blend, experience the benefits of combining
[05:45.640 --> 05:52.000]  over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[05:52.000 --> 06:02.320]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139, that's InfoWarsLife.com.
[06:02.320 --> 06:09.600]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[06:09.600 --> 06:11.960]  the mind of man.
[06:11.960 --> 06:19.360]  Thomas Jefferson, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[06:19.360 --> 06:29.720]  Well, by about 10 a.m. today, Central Standard Time, we're live on this Sunday edition, already
[06:29.720 --> 06:32.360]  the 10th day of May, 2015.
[06:32.360 --> 06:38.920]  I was getting tweets popping up on my iPhone, my phone rang, Joe Begg's called, I had some
[06:38.920 --> 06:48.560]  family call, and they were asking, why didn't you show up for this week with George Stephanophilus?
[06:48.560 --> 06:52.320]  Is it true you chickened out?
[06:52.320 --> 06:59.000]  And I went, no, we were in negotiations with them for me to come on, but they changed the
[06:59.000 --> 07:06.720]  deal, so we told them yesterday that we weren't sure we were going to do it, we have the emails
[07:06.720 --> 07:13.640]  until they got back with us and they didn't get back with us, so I didn't go on.
[07:13.640 --> 07:17.680]  And this is not about InfoWars.com, it's not about Alex Jones, it's not about a talk show
[07:17.680 --> 07:21.520]  host that, since they're like most of them do, and just talk about myself all day.
[07:21.520 --> 07:26.760]  This is an example of media manipulation and deception and what they do to good political
[07:26.760 --> 07:30.760]  candidates, muckrakers, investigative journalists, and others.
[07:30.760 --> 07:36.640]  Remember the CBS News reporter that exposed Fast and Furious investigative journalists,
[07:36.640 --> 07:39.000]  so they fired her?
[07:39.000 --> 07:44.840]  Or the other journalist at ABC News that was exposing what was happening with the IRS persecution,
[07:44.840 --> 07:45.840]  so they fired him?
[07:45.840 --> 07:47.400]  I mean, this is what they do.
[07:47.400 --> 07:51.400]  There's a war on journalists, there's a war on whistleblowers, and everybody knows about
[07:51.400 --> 07:52.400]  it.
[07:52.400 --> 07:56.320]  A month ago, the president, the Associated Press, came out and said, never in modern
[07:56.320 --> 08:03.840]  history has there been such a war on free speech in this country and such a war on journalism.
[08:03.840 --> 08:09.400]  And whether this week was Stephanophilus, the former Clinton chief of staff, I mean,
[08:09.400 --> 08:19.840]  talk about deceptive, that is like Pinocchio's archetype, you need to just understand that
[08:19.840 --> 08:23.240]  all these people can do is deceive.
[08:23.240 --> 08:28.560]  So long story short, Jade Helm is being called a firestorm by the Financial Times of London,
[08:28.560 --> 08:31.520]  the LA Times, the New York Times.
[08:31.520 --> 08:36.680]  It is a huge moment where states stop trusting the federal government because the federal
[08:36.680 --> 08:39.720]  government is basically run by special interests.
[08:39.720 --> 08:47.000]  Eisenhower said, beware the military industrial complex, whether sought or unsought, you need
[08:47.000 --> 08:48.960]  to understand that it's taking over.
[08:48.960 --> 08:54.320]  He was a top general, patriot, Republican president, and when I was going to go on this
[08:54.320 --> 09:00.120]  week with Stephanophilus today, I was going to start with a quote by Eisenhower, and I'd
[09:00.120 --> 09:01.880]  even memorize the exact quote.
[09:01.880 --> 09:04.880]  You guys put it on screen.
[09:04.880 --> 09:08.120]  As of yesterday, I actually had it printed up and then read it 10 or 15 times to get
[09:08.120 --> 09:12.000]  the full three paragraph quote together.
[09:12.000 --> 09:17.920]  He must beware the influence, whether sought or unsought, of the military industrial complex,
[09:17.920 --> 09:21.800]  and then he went into why.
[09:21.800 --> 09:25.920]  And so I was going to start with this three paragraph quote and just say, please let
[09:25.920 --> 09:27.280]  me speak.
[09:27.280 --> 09:29.160]  Everyone knows we're turning into a police state.
[09:29.160 --> 09:33.760]  There's a national debate about militarization of police, and I was going to hold up Forbes
[09:33.760 --> 09:39.920]  and Reuters and Army Times with headlines about the Army preparing to take on gun owners,
[09:39.920 --> 09:45.200]  veterans, and the Tea Party in the headlines, how the Pentagon would crush the Tea Party.
[09:45.200 --> 09:49.440]  I mean, I always have exhibits, and they know that.
[09:49.440 --> 09:53.040]  So even if I got one minute, I was going to quote Eisenhower, and I was going to hold
[09:53.040 --> 09:56.720]  up articles and say, this is why we're concerned.
[09:56.720 --> 10:00.840]  And we're not against the rank and file military stop building a straw man.
[10:00.840 --> 10:06.000]  But I knew, I told my producer when they called an email Tuesday, he said, hey, this week
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.200]  once you want.
[10:09.200 --> 10:11.840]  And I said, listen, I'm not going to do it.
[10:11.840 --> 10:20.480]  I don't want to respond because this is what's going to happen, Nico.
[10:20.480 --> 10:21.800]  They're going to wait till Friday.
[10:21.800 --> 10:22.920]  We're going to demand it be live.
[10:22.920 --> 10:25.360]  They're going to say, of course, it's live.
[10:25.360 --> 10:28.720]  Then they're going to say, so in case there's any satellite problems, which are less than
[10:28.720 --> 10:31.720]  1% out of a thousand, this is totally made up.
[10:31.720 --> 10:36.160]  It's more than, I mean, less than 1% out of a thousand, it's just, you might have seconds
[10:36.160 --> 10:38.160]  of down satellite time in a feed a month.
[10:38.160 --> 10:40.080]  I mean, it's just do the math.
[10:40.080 --> 10:44.320]  I said, then Friday, they'll say, because in case there's satellite problems, we want
[10:44.320 --> 10:49.960]  to tape it Saturday or Sunday.
[10:49.960 --> 10:51.400]  And then sure enough, he calls me Friday night.
[10:51.400 --> 10:53.040]  Yeah, they just emailed and called.
[10:53.040 --> 10:54.040]  They want to tape it.
[10:54.040 --> 10:57.480]  And I said, next, they're going to say it's not 10 minutes.
[10:57.480 --> 10:58.480]  It's not five minutes.
[10:58.480 --> 10:59.480]  It's two minutes.
[10:59.480 --> 11:01.160]  And then, of course, he's on the phone with them.
[11:01.160 --> 11:02.560]  They started telling him that.
[11:02.560 --> 11:06.560]  And I said, they'll probably just get me at say five or six in the morning to harass
[11:06.560 --> 11:12.480]  me, drive me into town, which has happened to me just total more than 20 times with
[11:12.480 --> 11:15.160]  all the networks, like eight or nine times or something with CNN.
[11:15.160 --> 11:19.280]  I mean, to the point that I just won't respond to CNN.
[11:19.280 --> 11:25.920]  I've been flown to New York City and canceled on CNN and Fox News.
[11:25.920 --> 11:26.920]  Okay.
[11:26.920 --> 11:28.600]  I just don't do it anymore.
[11:28.600 --> 11:32.280]  But then some of the times I refuse and they go on the air and go, he's chicken.
[11:32.280 --> 11:33.280]  He won't come on.
[11:33.280 --> 11:39.560]  I can't live on airplanes flying for you to cancel me where you play your little games.
[11:39.560 --> 11:43.280]  I won't do it.
[11:43.280 --> 11:48.400]  I mean, I'm the narrator on two or three Discovery Channel shows, history shows right
[11:48.400 --> 11:49.400]  now.
[11:49.400 --> 11:53.600]  What's incredible is I don't even watch the shows I'm on.
[11:53.600 --> 11:54.600]  Everybody tells me about them.
[11:54.600 --> 11:56.560]  I mean, I know I did go into the interviews.
[11:56.560 --> 11:58.240]  I've got a syndicated radio show.
[11:58.240 --> 11:59.960]  I've got millions of readers a day.
[11:59.960 --> 12:03.640]  I make documentary films that get seen 30, 40, 50 million times a piece.
[12:03.640 --> 12:12.320]  I don't need this week on ABC because all you're going to do is distort whatever I've
[12:12.320 --> 12:13.320]  said.
[12:13.320 --> 12:15.400]  So I only do it live.
[12:15.400 --> 12:16.920]  This is a microcosm of their deception.
[12:16.920 --> 12:18.160]  We're going to play the piece coming up.
[12:18.160 --> 12:22.560]  It's like six minutes long to analyze it.
[12:22.560 --> 12:26.600]  They had a guest host today.
[12:26.600 --> 12:33.880]  And so Nico calls me yesterday, I'm out shooting firearms, I'm out shooting the incredible
[12:33.880 --> 12:38.200]  head down vigilance gun.
[12:38.200 --> 12:45.320]  It translates out of Latin individuals or to win before, and I'm out there shooting
[12:45.320 --> 12:49.160]  these amazing firearms with Joe Biggs and change time and the rest of the crew.
[12:49.160 --> 12:56.480]  He calls me about two o'clock, the Pro Victus is what I was shooting, two variants of that.
[12:56.480 --> 13:04.360]  And he goes, yeah, they want you to be picked up at 6.15 for an eight o'clock taping.
[13:04.360 --> 13:06.280]  And I said, that's insane.
[13:06.280 --> 13:07.760]  It takes 30 minutes to get into the studio.
[13:07.760 --> 13:09.880]  I'm not going to do it.
[13:09.880 --> 13:10.880]  Just tell them no.
[13:10.880 --> 13:15.080]  In fact, live or nothing like we agreed last Tuesday.
[13:15.080 --> 13:16.480]  Those emails are all sent.
[13:16.480 --> 13:19.160]  I have them right here on screen for TV viewers.
[13:19.160 --> 13:23.000]  I'll show you the emails coming back in the next segment.
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.200]  And then we never hear from them.
[13:25.200 --> 13:31.800]  Next, 12 minutes, and there's screenshots in the article at infoawards.com, 12 minutes
[13:31.800 --> 13:37.800]  to nine when the show goes live, 12 minutes.
[13:37.800 --> 13:41.800]  I have the one text, because they're claiming it like 8.15, they're calling me and texting
[13:41.800 --> 13:42.800]  me.
[13:42.800 --> 13:43.800]  No, they're not.
[13:43.800 --> 13:54.800]  No, there's one text at 8.48, we can show it on screen for TV viewers, 8.48.
[13:54.800 --> 13:59.640]  As you can see, today, it's into your iPhone.
[13:59.640 --> 14:08.360]  Your car is at the, for the studio, Neil, and I ended up coming into town, staying downtown
[14:08.360 --> 14:14.320]  with my kids, just so I wouldn't have to drive 30 minutes a day to make sure I'd be there.
[14:14.320 --> 14:15.480]  But I'd set that up days before.
[14:15.480 --> 14:17.200]  I already knew it wasn't going to happen.
[14:17.200 --> 14:19.160]  So this is the hoax they run.
[14:19.160 --> 14:23.120]  Then they go on television and say, I didn't show up.
[14:23.120 --> 14:29.000]  Then they have their minions tweet that I'm afraid, oh, I'm really afraid.
[14:29.000 --> 14:33.520]  I would love to be put in the arena with you chicken necks.
[14:33.520 --> 14:39.400]  I would love for you to put me anywhere, anytime, live, satellite or in person with
[14:39.400 --> 14:43.120]  George Stephanopoulos, Bill Clinton, anybody.
[14:43.120 --> 14:47.800]  I mean, I've confronted Hillary, Bill Clinton, I've confronted Janet Reno, I've confronted
[14:47.800 --> 14:50.320]  George Bush, I've been arrested for doing it.
[14:50.320 --> 14:57.160]  I have, I have protested at Fox and their cover-up of 9-11 and the Saudi connection and been arrested
[14:57.160 --> 14:58.160]  and beat up.
[14:58.160 --> 14:59.160]  I mean, all on footage.
[14:59.160 --> 15:01.880]  I've been on The View.
[15:01.880 --> 15:06.920]  That's a big show with like 15 million viewers, not 5 million like The Sunday News Show, which
[15:06.920 --> 15:07.920]  is big.
[15:07.920 --> 15:11.720]  I mean, for imploded mainstream media, it's one of the biggest things left out there.
[15:11.720 --> 15:14.360]  But I got 20 million viewers and listeners a week.
[15:14.360 --> 15:16.480]  I mean, I don't need you.
[15:16.480 --> 15:20.800]  And they were so upset and they said like four or five times that I wouldn't show up
[15:20.800 --> 15:24.040]  during the, during a whole panel discussion.
[15:24.040 --> 15:28.240]  We wish we could have asked him this, we wish we could ask him that, oh, yeah, right.
[15:28.240 --> 15:34.120]  You wish you could have asked me as you misrepresent and deceive everybody up there.
[15:34.120 --> 15:38.960]  So you say, no, we're not doing it live after you promised it'd be live.
[15:38.960 --> 15:42.800]  And by the way, I was still intending to go down there taped because I was going to have
[15:42.800 --> 15:47.440]  my cousin come buckly who lives downtown and videotape what really happened.
[15:47.440 --> 15:50.880]  I don't see it in before so that I could show how you've edited it.
[15:50.880 --> 15:53.320]  But then we never heard back from you jackasses.
[15:53.320 --> 15:59.240]  So you go on air and then clean our chicken down while I challenge any live ABC program

[16:59.960 --> 17:04.320]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[17:04.320 --> 17:07.880]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[17:07.880 --> 17:10.800]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.

[17:14.640 --> 17:18.280]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[17:18.280 --> 17:22.160]  On average the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[17:22.160 --> 17:26.680]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[17:26.680 --> 17:32.360]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[17:32.360 --> 17:36.320]  It is intense in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.

[17:39.000 --> 17:40.520]  The establishment is not going to do it.

[18:29.640 --> 18:31.240]  These people are assaulting us.

[20:22.160 --> 20:23.160]  Our thanks to David.
[20:23.160 --> 20:28.880]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones, who as David said has been one of the leading proponents
[20:28.880 --> 20:34.040]  of this theory, had agreed to join us this morning, but he did not show up at our studio.
[20:34.040 --> 20:38.000]  So let's continue with our propaganda.
[20:38.000 --> 20:46.480]  I'm going to play the entire unaided clip coming up here in just a moment.
[20:46.480 --> 20:51.840]  This is such a prism into every angle of this.
[20:51.840 --> 20:56.960]  You can watch the full clip at infowarslive.com and prismplanet.com right now.
[20:56.960 --> 21:02.600]  Dirty tricks, ABC claim of Alex Jones, no show is a hoax.
[21:02.600 --> 21:06.480]  And again in just a few minutes we're going to air the clip from the beginning.
[21:06.480 --> 21:09.600]  Network blames its own screw up on radio host.
[21:09.600 --> 21:13.960]  Now that's Paul Watson writing an article today on Sunday trying to be a journalist trying
[21:13.960 --> 21:14.960]  to be fair.
[21:14.960 --> 21:17.960]  I've done this hundreds of times.
[21:17.960 --> 21:23.880]  I've been in satellite studios 300 times or more.
[21:23.880 --> 21:27.600]  You'll notice you don't see me a lot doing it now because they just edit what I have
[21:27.600 --> 21:32.320]  to say down to 10 seconds to misrepresent what I'm saying because I don't just put
[21:32.320 --> 21:40.680]  out sound bites and also talk theoretically or rhetorically or I'll quote others and they'll
[21:40.680 --> 21:44.480]  do stuff like I'll quote Hitler and say Hitler was bad.
[21:44.480 --> 21:48.080]  They'll show me quote Hitler out of context like I'm pro-Hitler.
[21:48.080 --> 21:50.400]  I mean I've had that happen.
[21:50.400 --> 21:54.640]  You've all seen MSNBC say that I was behind the Boston bombings and then give no proof.
[21:54.640 --> 22:00.840]  I mean we're talking outrageous craziness and it's because of what I'm covering.
[22:00.840 --> 22:03.560]  But I know what happened here.
[22:03.560 --> 22:08.240]  They wanted to have an edited 30, 40 second piece to make it look like they were fair
[22:08.240 --> 22:14.080]  journalists and pretend journalists and that they interviewed the person that quote broke
[22:14.080 --> 22:20.640]  this story, the media system that first talked about this.
[22:20.640 --> 22:25.560]  And when I didn't show up to be taped because I told them I wasn't doing it yesterday in
[22:25.560 --> 22:33.360]  phone calls and email, they had to then oh gosh I guess let's get him live but wait that'll
[22:33.360 --> 22:39.240]  look bad if he's live, he'll take over like Piers Morgan and other shows and BBC.
[22:39.240 --> 22:46.240]  And so I get called at 848.
[22:46.240 --> 22:53.200]  It would take that long for me to go and get in the car and maybe get there.
[22:53.200 --> 22:58.880]  So I was sitting right there with coffee at the computer reading news, cars downstairs.
[22:58.880 --> 23:02.480]  I didn't call them nothing because I don't worship them.
[23:02.480 --> 23:07.960]  I'm sick of just waiting for the mainstream media and going to their studios three hours
[23:07.960 --> 23:08.960]  before.
[23:08.960 --> 23:15.480]  They want to be there at 6 a.m. or to be picked up at 6 and then just sit there in case a
[23:15.480 --> 23:17.280]  bunch of Washington wonks.
[23:17.280 --> 23:21.720]  I mean have you seen, they at least had interesting reporters, interesting newsmen and women who
[23:21.720 --> 23:24.000]  you wanted to watch who were stars.
[23:24.000 --> 23:30.760]  Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, Marley Safer, all these cool people.
[23:30.760 --> 23:35.360]  Now you watch it, it's all a bunch of political operatives at the Democratic Party mainly.
[23:35.360 --> 23:37.440]  80% of them on average.
[23:37.440 --> 23:41.240]  A bunch of boring mummies on TV.
[23:41.240 --> 23:45.760]  Imagine if Carl Rove had his own show, it'd be boring.
[23:45.760 --> 23:50.760]  I mean it's just, it's just, you wonder why you don't have any viewers anymore.
[23:50.760 --> 23:53.880]  These Sunday news shows used to have 10, 15 million viewers.
[23:53.880 --> 23:59.640]  Now they got 3, 4, 5 million and they're lucky.
[23:59.640 --> 24:02.440]  And then I'm just going to let you edit what I have to say.
[24:02.440 --> 24:05.840]  Eisenhower warned of the military industrial complex taking over.
[24:05.840 --> 24:09.800]  We have the military train to take on gun owners and vats, it's all over the news.
[24:09.800 --> 24:15.800]  The military is telling us about it, they don't like us.
[24:15.800 --> 24:18.080]  Exposing this.
[24:18.080 --> 24:24.100]  Here is the Eisenhower quote, in the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition
[24:24.100 --> 24:28.880]  of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex,
[24:28.880 --> 24:34.680]  the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[24:34.680 --> 24:37.880]  Should I play the actual TV clip?
[24:37.880 --> 24:45.800]  I was going to go on and quote that and I had gotten myself where I'd memorized it yesterday
[24:45.800 --> 24:50.080]  and I was going to open with that and then I was going to clean their clocks.
[24:50.080 --> 24:53.440]  I was going to say in every other third world country and dictatorship, the military's
[24:53.440 --> 24:54.880]  been used to take over.
[24:54.880 --> 25:00.800]  From the Soviet Union, with the rise of the Bolsheviks, to Nazi Germany, to Mao Zedong,
[25:00.800 --> 25:04.480]  political power grows out of the barrel of a gun and here I have Forbes and here I have
[25:04.480 --> 25:09.720]  Reuters with the headlines that the military's main mission is taking on the American people.
[25:09.720 --> 25:16.880]  Now as Senator Cruz has said, the mainstream media has lost credibility and so has the
[25:16.880 --> 25:22.040]  government and so Texas is concerned and Governor Abbott simply said we're going to
[25:22.040 --> 25:24.920]  monitor it to allay fears.
[25:24.920 --> 25:30.320]  And you then put out hundreds of editorial articles, editorial cartoons showing Texans
[25:30.320 --> 25:35.880]  picking their nose, wearing Alex Jones fan T-shirts and tinfoil hats pointing guns at
[25:35.880 --> 25:37.440]  Governor Abbott.
[25:37.440 --> 25:44.040]  That's the LA Times cartoon graphic that we'll put up on screen from the LA Times itself.
[25:44.040 --> 25:49.680]  But you type in Alex Jones, Jade Helm, there's 250 something articles today and this cartoon
[25:49.680 --> 25:54.840]  is one of them with the Alex Jones fan and the Texans eating their buggers and the Texan
[25:54.840 --> 26:01.680]  with the rebel flag putting a gun to the head of the governor.
[26:01.680 --> 26:07.880]  What's constituent must be fancy word for patriot and as the governor's saying, I know
[26:07.880 --> 26:13.720]  the U.S. Army is not about to take over Texas and lock up everyone in Walmarts but since
[26:13.720 --> 26:22.800]  my constituents believe it, I'm sending in the state guard.
[26:22.800 --> 26:26.680]  That's the, and then the seal of the state of the paranormal, really the paranormal,
[26:26.680 --> 26:29.320]  the militarization of police.
[26:29.320 --> 26:33.440]  The president acting as a dictator outside of Congress.
[26:33.440 --> 26:36.640]  That's why Louis Garment, Army veteran came out and said, no, I'm concerned about martial
[26:36.640 --> 26:37.640]  law.
[26:37.640 --> 26:41.200]  We don't think this event's going to be it, but it's clearly part of the long term
[26:41.200 --> 26:47.120]  acclimation program for it.
[26:47.120 --> 26:51.880]  But this itself is an example of how they respond.
[26:51.880 --> 26:58.800]  Let's go ahead and go out to break with the first part of the White House run in staff
[26:58.800 --> 27:01.880]  by a bunch of White House operatives face the nation.
[27:01.880 --> 27:02.880]  Here it is.
[27:02.880 --> 27:08.880]  Now to a Texas sized conspiracy theory, sparking headlines across the country, including this
[27:08.880 --> 27:17.120]  week in the New York Times, the theory, the upcoming, I'm going to analyze this.
[27:17.120 --> 27:22.040]  This week face the nation, they're all the same of this ABC news piece very slowly.
[27:22.040 --> 27:23.480]  First they're God is the New York Times.
[27:23.480 --> 27:25.680]  That's where they get their main talking points.
[27:25.680 --> 27:29.080]  So they didn't start reporting on this at this week until the New York Times reported
[27:29.080 --> 27:30.080]  it.
[27:30.080 --> 27:33.760]  Even though it already been on CBS, ABC, NBC, all the nightly news, they just start reporting
[27:33.760 --> 27:39.600]  on it on the major policy wonk show where the establishment tunes in to get their talking
[27:39.600 --> 27:42.440]  points until the New York Times got to it.
[27:42.440 --> 27:46.640]  And then it's a Texas size, you know, Texas tails.
[27:46.640 --> 27:52.880]  No, Texans have the lower taxes, have more of the basic freedoms, have the right to
[27:52.880 --> 27:54.640]  private property, things like that.
[27:54.640 --> 28:01.280]  That's why everyone like a lifeboat is fleeing the east and the west, California, other areas
[28:01.280 --> 28:02.960]  to come here.
[28:02.960 --> 28:07.760]  So you make the jokes, you show some country music and some hay seeds and imply we're all
[28:07.760 --> 28:11.200]  a bunch of bumpkins don't know what go on.
[28:11.200 --> 28:15.960]  Now we know the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, the Patriot Act, the rest of it.
[28:15.960 --> 28:16.960]  So we're going to go to break.
[28:16.960 --> 28:17.960]  So we have plenty of time.
[28:17.960 --> 28:23.520]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to play this and just analyze this from the front
[28:23.520 --> 28:24.520]  to the back.
[28:24.520 --> 28:30.200]  But remember, they wanted to claim that they tried to have me there to debate me.
[28:30.200 --> 28:36.520]  But magically it didn't happen, magically, because they knew I was going to come out
[28:36.520 --> 28:40.480]  and say, I told you only live, you agreed to it, you stopped.
[28:40.480 --> 28:44.080]  So they wanted to be able to say, we wanted to talk to Mr. Jones, but he wouldn't show
[28:44.080 --> 28:47.600]  up to imply I've got something to hide.
[28:47.600 --> 28:48.920]  I've had him do it before.
[28:48.920 --> 28:49.920]  This is what they do.
[28:49.920 --> 28:50.920]  They want to play a journalist.
[28:50.920 --> 28:55.040]  Most of the time, print media calls a suit interview, it's just to act like they talk
[28:55.040 --> 28:56.040]  to us.
[28:56.040 --> 28:57.040]  They won't even quote us.
[28:57.040 --> 29:00.400]  It's all just theater.
[29:00.400 --> 29:08.360]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[29:08.360 --> 29:13.280]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[29:13.280 --> 29:16.040]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[29:16.040 --> 29:21.400]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[29:21.400 --> 29:25.920]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[29:25.920 --> 29:30.320]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic

[30:12.760 --> 30:18.320]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are
[30:18.320 --> 30:23.640]  not of the very highest quality or because they're not 100% organic or because they don't
[30:23.640 --> 30:29.680]  ask all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at InfoWarsLife.com.
[30:29.680 --> 30:34.920]  Whether it's survival shield, nascent iodine or DNA force, super male vitality, super

[31:29.760 --> 31:30.760]  Alex Jones here.
[31:30.760 --> 31:35.080]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist and chemist
[31:35.080 --> 31:40.600]  to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life changing health benefits.
[31:40.600 --> 31:45.520]  Introducing the all new ancient defense herbal immunity blend, experience the benefits of
[31:45.520 --> 31:51.320]  combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical
[31:51.320 --> 31:52.320]  science.
[31:52.320 --> 31:57.440]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[31:57.440 --> 31:59.920]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[31:59.920 --> 32:04.800]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around
[32:04.800 --> 32:09.480]  the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[32:09.480 --> 32:14.240]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder available through
[32:14.240 --> 32:19.440]  InfoWarsLife was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[32:19.440 --> 32:24.640]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous
[32:24.640 --> 32:29.720]  ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[32:29.720 --> 32:34.520]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[32:34.520 --> 32:39.360]  Oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[32:39.360 --> 32:45.680]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[32:45.680 --> 32:50.400]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of super oxide and ozonide technology.
[32:50.400 --> 33:15.680]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with oxy powder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[33:15.680 --> 33:21.760]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side, you're listening
[33:21.760 --> 33:23.760]  to Alex Jones.
[33:23.760 --> 33:31.680]  I want to be clear, this is bigger than InfoWars, we're not covering this because we're all
[33:31.680 --> 33:45.120]  out of the news, it's the anatomy, the structure, the tissue, the makeup, the skeletal undergirding
[33:45.120 --> 33:47.520]  of the takeover incrementally of this society.
[33:47.520 --> 33:57.360]  I mean, I'd get up here with James Bamford, former producer of Nightline in like 1998
[33:57.360 --> 34:02.280]  when he had a book out about NSA spying with all the documents.
[34:02.280 --> 34:08.280]  It's basically everything Snowden's told us and people would say, Jones claims he's
[34:08.280 --> 34:14.840]  exposed the NSA and that they're spying without warrants, haha, that's illegal.
[34:14.840 --> 34:18.560]  Everyone knows that's impossible.
[34:18.560 --> 34:24.880]  Good guys run the government and now we know they're spying on Congress itself, the bureaucracy,
[34:24.880 --> 34:25.880]  the worst, the worst.
[34:25.880 --> 34:31.960]  I mean, Congress came out on Friday and said, we're allowed to insider trade again and shut
[34:31.960 --> 34:39.760]  down an SEC investigation into massive insider trading.
[34:39.760 --> 34:48.440]  One's been legalized at the top, but little people are under attack and they want this
[34:48.440 --> 34:53.560]  gravy train to continue and as Texans and others wake up and don't want to be slaves,
[34:53.560 --> 34:59.280]  don't want Obamacare, don't want their kids taught how to have sex at age five, don't
[34:59.280 --> 35:04.680]  want forced inoculations, you just call us kooks and there are no exaggeration, more
[35:04.680 --> 35:08.600]  than 15 news articles I saw today where they have me or others wearing tinfoil hats on
[35:08.600 --> 35:10.800]  their head.
[35:10.800 --> 35:11.800]  Where's your debate?
[35:11.800 --> 35:14.320]  Where's your argument?
[35:14.320 --> 35:20.120]  Jade Helm mastering the human domain we have now discovered back to Pentagon documents is
[35:20.120 --> 35:25.360]  indeed for domestic scyops and to condition the public under sociology to understand
[35:25.360 --> 35:31.640]  how to take over America and I love how they have Republicans and Democrats and including
[35:31.640 --> 35:36.920]  this panel saying, listen, you can not trust the government, that's fine, but you don't
[35:36.920 --> 35:39.100]  question our military.
[35:39.100 --> 35:45.600]  That is such a bizarre statement, our military is run by the government, it's self run by
[35:45.600 --> 35:46.600]  special interest.
[35:46.600 --> 35:53.040]  It's like saying, you can question Hitler, but you don't question the German army.
[35:53.040 --> 35:59.080]  Well, who runs the German army in 1939, 1944?
[35:59.080 --> 36:03.480]  It's just the logic has left the building, but I saw a video on infowars.com in a news
[36:03.480 --> 36:10.760]  article Friday where the majority of New Yorkers who spoke English, you know, these were domestic
[36:10.760 --> 36:11.760]  people.
[36:11.760 --> 36:14.360]  Few of them had accents, they knew what World War II was.
[36:14.360 --> 36:17.480]  They didn't know what World War II was.
[36:17.480 --> 36:21.680]  They thought it was desert storm, most of them.
[36:21.680 --> 36:25.480]  Yeah, we fought Hitler and that tsunami guy in the desert, right?
[36:25.480 --> 36:31.280]  I mean, they're just, these shows target, and you know the demographics for this week,
[36:31.280 --> 36:34.680]  senile old people, that's what they think it's old people, but they only senile folks
[36:34.680 --> 36:40.520]  are watching it mainly, and kind of government types and people getting their talking points.
[36:40.520 --> 36:43.480]  So they're just praying on people.
[36:43.480 --> 36:47.560]  And that's why we have a bigger audience than you.
[36:47.560 --> 36:51.760]  I mean, we've got five million views a week on one YouTube channel.
[36:51.760 --> 36:54.880]  You have three and a half, four million viewers a week.
[36:54.880 --> 36:57.240]  I mean, where is the prestige?
[36:57.240 --> 37:02.080]  We have three million radio listeners rated a day listening.
[37:02.080 --> 37:04.320]  You add all the aggregate systems together.
[37:04.320 --> 37:05.880]  It's 20 million.
[37:05.880 --> 37:12.000]  There's the article VE Day, because that was, that was the 70th anniversary on Friday.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.400]  Americans don't know what World War II was.
[37:14.400 --> 37:21.080]  See, that's the type of American that these shows have helped create totally dumbed down.
[37:21.080 --> 37:22.080]  Totally mindless.
[37:22.080 --> 37:26.360]  Now I'm going to try to shut up and not pause too much during this and maybe just write
[37:26.360 --> 37:29.480]  notes because it is really hard to listen to.
[37:29.480 --> 37:34.200]  But let's go ahead and go to the piece that they claim I chickened out on.
[37:34.200 --> 37:40.920]  Does anyone really believe I chickened out to debate these people?
[37:40.920 --> 37:44.560]  They chickened out and said I couldn't come on live.
[37:44.560 --> 37:50.080]  And then I said, why do you want me there three hours early to tape it?
[37:50.080 --> 37:51.240]  I'm not doing it.
[37:51.240 --> 37:52.680]  I'll do live or nothing.
[37:52.680 --> 37:57.960]  And they didn't respond and then showed up 12 minutes before airtime so they could claim
[37:57.960 --> 38:02.120]  with their $50 taxi cab that I was a chicken.
[38:02.120 --> 38:05.200]  He wouldn't come on and debate us while we win.
[38:05.200 --> 38:10.080]  Let's go to another rigged fight where they took the engine out of our NASCAR and claimed
[38:10.080 --> 38:11.520]  that we were scared to race.
[38:11.520 --> 38:12.520]  Here it is.
[38:12.520 --> 38:18.480]  Now to a Texas-sized conspiracy theory, sparking headlines across the country, including this
[38:18.480 --> 38:24.800]  week in the New York Times, the theory that an upcoming Pentagon training exercise is
[38:24.800 --> 38:32.040]  actually part of a plan to impose martial law to many it's far fetched, but not to Texas
[38:32.040 --> 38:35.000]  because you know they're knuckle-draggers.
[38:35.000 --> 38:41.280]  We have said that is preparation for all-out conditioning and that then we show the Pentagon
[38:41.280 --> 38:42.280]  documents.
[38:42.280 --> 38:44.800]  So let's go back to her.
[38:44.800 --> 38:51.360]  It's far fetched, but not to some of the top politicians in the Lone Star State.
[38:51.360 --> 38:52.360]  And you know why?
[38:52.360 --> 38:56.640]  Because they know, as Louis Gohmert the Congressman said, it's in all these Pentagon training manuals
[38:56.640 --> 39:01.400]  to take on veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians and Christians.
[39:01.400 --> 39:06.880]  So see, everybody knows because you're on MSNBC promoting how we need to arrest all
[39:06.880 --> 39:10.520]  the Tea Party and how great it is to have the IRS persecute people.
[39:10.520 --> 39:12.520]  I mean, they own up to all that.
[39:12.520 --> 39:15.760]  You guys ship guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment.
[39:15.760 --> 39:17.880]  You've opened the borders up outside of law.
[39:17.880 --> 39:21.760]  Obamacare is gang-raping the country.
[39:21.760 --> 39:27.400]  You're saying we can keep our doctor and all these lies and you're not...
[39:27.400 --> 39:32.640]  So you can sit there all pretentious with your shrinking audience, like an African water
[39:32.640 --> 39:33.640]  hole.
[39:33.640 --> 39:35.040]  You're all like a bunch of crocodiles in there.
[39:35.040 --> 39:36.680]  There's not about being water left.
[39:36.680 --> 39:40.120]  You're just snapping, but you're still a mighty crocodile.
[39:40.120 --> 39:42.720]  Even though you're on your last legs, you still are arrogant.
[39:42.720 --> 39:46.240]  You still are a predator, aren't you?
[39:46.240 --> 39:49.240]  Just another control freak predator.
[39:49.240 --> 39:51.440]  I can't even look at her.
[39:51.440 --> 39:52.440]  Just go back to the club.
[39:52.440 --> 39:55.440]  He sees David Wright.
[39:55.440 --> 39:59.680]  Mama, tell all your babies, don't mess with Texas.
[39:59.680 --> 40:04.160]  From Willie Nelson on down, it's practically the slogan of the state.
[40:04.160 --> 40:06.040]  Don't mess with Texas.
[40:06.040 --> 40:09.440]  And that may explain the reaction to Jade Helm 15.
[40:09.440 --> 40:14.520]  A multi-state training exercise for U.S. special forces planned this summer for the
[40:14.520 --> 40:15.520]  Southwest.
[40:15.520 --> 40:20.360]  Talk show host Alex Jones, among the many, stirring up concerns on conservative websites
[40:20.360 --> 40:21.840]  and social media.
[40:21.840 --> 40:28.800]  The Jade Helm is a Trojan horse for a federal invasion, a dress rehearsal for martial law.
[40:28.800 --> 40:33.080]  This is in preparation for the financial collapse and maybe even Obama not leaving
[40:33.080 --> 40:34.080]  office.
[40:34.080 --> 40:35.520]  I mean, I'm telling you, this is so huge.
[40:35.520 --> 40:38.600]  Never mind the Pentagon's reassurances to the contrary.
[40:38.600 --> 40:40.840]  It's the U.S. military planning to overtake.
[40:40.840 --> 40:41.840]  Back it up.
[40:41.840 --> 40:45.120]  This is the Secretary of Defense about to speak and deny it like it's a big joke.
[40:45.120 --> 40:50.120]  Everybody laughs, like little lap dogs, trained seals, or, I mean, other fish.
[40:50.120 --> 40:55.160]  They show the Jade Helm document itself, despite the Pentagon's assurances.
[40:55.160 --> 40:58.320]  It's the document that admits they'll be doing stuff that's illegal.
[40:58.320 --> 41:01.160]  It's the document admitting it's to win hearts and minds domestically.
[41:01.160 --> 41:05.080]  It's the document that lists Texas and Utah and Orange County as hostile.
[41:05.080 --> 41:07.160]  So, see, they'll use.
[41:07.160 --> 41:11.320]  It'd be like Jeffrey Dahmer to the cops going, I don't, I didn't kill anybody.
[41:11.320 --> 41:14.920]  And he opens up the refrigerator and it's full of dead bodies.
[41:14.920 --> 41:15.920]  See?
[41:15.920 --> 41:16.920]  Now, is that outright?
[41:16.920 --> 41:17.920]  Excuse me.
[41:17.920 --> 41:18.920]  Let me take a bite off this bicep here.
[41:18.920 --> 41:19.920]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[41:19.920 --> 41:21.720]  It has an arm in his hand.
[41:21.720 --> 41:23.760]  I mean, I mean, come on.
[41:23.760 --> 41:28.720]  Well, Charlie Manson, the dead baby in his hands, he's cut out of Sharon Tate and he's
[41:28.720 --> 41:29.720]  like, come on, police.
[41:29.720 --> 41:31.220]  I didn't do anything.
[41:31.220 --> 41:36.760]  Or the bank robber caught in the vault going, I'm not stealing anything with a mask on and
[41:36.760 --> 41:38.880]  a lute in his hands.
[41:38.880 --> 41:41.040]  Let's go back to the deception.
[41:41.040 --> 41:43.960]  Never mind the Pentagon's reassurances to the country.
[41:43.960 --> 41:47.000]  It's the US military planning to overtake Texas.
[41:47.000 --> 41:48.000]  No.
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.200]  All we want to do is make sure that our guys are trained for combat overseas.
[41:53.200 --> 41:57.320]  At a town hall meeting in central Texas, this lieutenant colonel got an earful.
[41:57.320 --> 42:02.600]  It is a preparation for martial law and it's not a preparation for martial law, sir.
[42:02.600 --> 42:04.800]  That's what you say.
[42:04.800 --> 42:12.640]  For the Alamo Texas does only in this remake, those wouldn't be Santa Ana's troops marshaling
[42:12.640 --> 42:14.040]  in the desert.
[42:14.040 --> 42:17.920]  Texas politicians have added fuel to the fire by taking those concerns seriously.
[42:17.920 --> 42:22.920]  You know, I understand the concern that's been raised by a lot of citizens about J.
[42:22.920 --> 42:23.920]  Hell.
[42:23.920 --> 42:29.920]  And I think part of the reason is we have seen for six years a federal government disrespecting
[42:29.920 --> 42:31.960]  the liberty of the city.
[42:31.960 --> 42:32.960]  That's Ted Cruz.
[42:32.960 --> 42:36.920]  Of course, they edited out to say he doesn't think the military is bad and doesn't think
[42:36.920 --> 42:40.400]  this is a takeover to make it sound like he does.
[42:40.400 --> 42:41.840]  This is how they deceive you.
[42:41.840 --> 42:42.840]  But it doesn't work anymore.
[42:42.840 --> 42:47.120]  So just keep deceiving, keep playing like you only have the big audience and then we
[42:47.120 --> 42:53.280]  don't and just keep playing like in an imaginary make-believe land that you're in charge because
[42:53.280 --> 42:54.400]  you're not.
[42:54.400 --> 42:55.480]  You got your pants down.
[42:55.480 --> 42:56.480]  We see you.
[42:56.480 --> 43:00.400]  And that's why the elected representatives of Texas know that.
[43:00.400 --> 43:04.320]  Did you know that the tipping point for global warming started back in the 80s?
[43:04.320 --> 43:08.480]  The UN reported that we were hurtling towards an unstoppable climate shift that would have
[43:08.480 --> 43:10.120]  dire consequences.
[43:10.120 --> 43:15.280]  Fast forward to Prince Charles' warning back in 2009 that we only had 96 months to save
[43:15.280 --> 43:16.280]  the planet.
[43:16.280 --> 43:17.680]  The clock is ticking on that one.
[43:17.680 --> 43:22.640]  And let's not forget Al Gore quoting studies back in 2007 stating that the polar ice caps
[43:22.640 --> 43:25.200]  would be completely gone by now.
[43:25.200 --> 43:30.560]  This year we saw articles with headlines like 2014, the hottest year on record.
[43:30.560 --> 43:34.480]  The same articles failed to mention cities like Chicago, Illinois, which saw its coldest
[43:34.480 --> 43:36.760]  weather in over 100 years.
[43:36.760 --> 43:40.400]  No mention of big ice breaking ships getting stuck in ice.
[43:40.400 --> 43:44.600]  So remember when these carbon tax pushers tell you to lessen your carbon footprint,
[43:44.600 --> 43:48.840]  they're about to leap into their multi-vehicle convoy, drive to their private jets and then
[43:48.840 --> 43:51.160]  go to sleep in one of their many houses.
[43:51.160 --> 43:56.160]  Come by the sea, you can find more reports on infowars.com.
[43:56.160 --> 44:26.080]  Check out the new videos on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[44:26.080 --> 44:27.080]  Change is a lot of energy.
[44:27.080 --> 44:32.280]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[44:32.280 --> 44:38.040]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated or
[44:38.040 --> 44:43.200]  maximum potency, they want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover
[44:43.200 --> 44:47.000]  that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets
[44:47.000 --> 44:50.080]  your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[44:50.080 --> 44:52.040]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[44:57.880 --> 44:59.880]  from InfoWars Life.

[45:03.920 --> 45:09.040]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[45:09.040 --> 45:13.080]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[45:13.080 --> 45:17.400]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[45:17.400 --> 45:22.720]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[45:22.720 --> 45:29.120]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.

[45:34.240 --> 45:36.360]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[45:36.360 --> 45:40.640]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[45:40.640 --> 45:43.240]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[45:43.240 --> 45:47.680]  Brought by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[45:47.680 --> 45:51.160]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[45:51.160 --> 45:56.080]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[45:56.080 --> 45:57.840]  my favorite coffee.
[45:57.840 --> 45:59.640]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[45:59.640 --> 46:04.160]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[46:04.160 --> 46:07.680]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[46:07.680 --> 46:10.640]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[46:10.640 --> 46:14.480]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[46:14.480 --> 46:18.040]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[46:18.040 --> 46:22.000]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.480]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[46:26.480 --> 46:32.160]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[46:32.160 --> 46:36.080]  Fluoride is intense in coffee, it's in water, it's in breads, it's in toothpaste.
[46:36.080 --> 46:38.800]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[46:38.800 --> 46:40.320]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[46:40.320 --> 46:43.600]  It's time to take action, it's time to filter our water.

[47:03.000 --> 47:18.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:18.560 --> 47:24.560]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the
[47:24.560 --> 47:27.560]  GCN radio network.
[47:27.560 --> 47:28.640]  And what's the New World Order?
[47:28.640 --> 47:34.440]  It's the Dolderberg group, the Davos group, very same globalist, robber barons, folks
[47:34.440 --> 47:38.640]  like George Soros and others that control the world's currencies and credit that are
[47:38.640 --> 47:42.880]  bringing in a planetary standardized system where they're above the law to have diplomatic
[47:42.880 --> 47:43.880]  immunity.
[47:43.880 --> 47:47.480]  We've got to pay them selectively enforced taxes.
[47:47.480 --> 47:54.760]  It's just a return to feudalism with a oligarchy sitting on top of us.
[47:54.760 --> 48:02.920]  The good news is, all over the country, people are waking up to Agenda 21, to open borders,
[48:02.920 --> 48:06.600]  to gun control, to militarization of police.
[48:06.600 --> 48:11.200]  This is all really about federalist takeover.
[48:11.200 --> 48:16.360]  Not the old federalist system of sharing power between the states and the feds, but the federal
[48:16.360 --> 48:23.720]  takeover, the feds themselves controlled by offshore interest.
[48:23.720 --> 48:27.400]  John Stewart comes out on Comedy Central and makes fun of us and says, you've already
[48:27.400 --> 48:29.920]  been conquered by the army.
[48:29.920 --> 48:30.920]  And that's their view.
[48:30.920 --> 48:32.040]  See, there are no states.
[48:32.040 --> 48:33.760]  There is no sovereignty.
[48:33.760 --> 48:35.440]  There is no individual freedom.
[48:35.440 --> 48:38.600]  Didn't you know?
[48:38.600 --> 48:42.840]  But America is waking up to just how captured we are.
[48:42.840 --> 48:43.840]  They want kids to grow up.
[48:43.840 --> 48:50.400]  It's normal to have troops all over the streets and TSA sticking their hands down your pants.
[48:50.400 --> 48:56.520]  And even better news is, mainstream media would have done a better job for themselves
[48:56.520 --> 49:00.320]  than their foreign owners if they had just kept their mouth shut about Jade Helm and
[49:00.320 --> 49:02.040]  ignored us.
[49:02.040 --> 49:09.280]  But by lying five weeks ago and saying, there is no Jade Helm, Jones claims he has a document
[49:09.280 --> 49:13.160]  he doesn't have proof, then, oh, Jones says it's secret, but it's not.
[49:13.160 --> 49:14.280]  Never said that.
[49:14.280 --> 49:15.640]  Building straw men.
[49:15.640 --> 49:16.640]  Building fake arguments.
[49:16.640 --> 49:19.440]  What's the big deal about the troops?
[49:19.440 --> 49:24.160]  There's no plan for domestic takeover when we have hundreds of articles where the mainstream
[49:24.160 --> 49:30.120]  media is pushing that the Pentagon's needed for veterans and gun owners.
[49:30.120 --> 49:35.200]  And see, the people showing up at town halls all over Texas, not just Pastrop, where they're
[49:35.200 --> 49:40.400]  canceling different Jade Helm operations, it's just Jade Helm is based at Camp Swift
[49:40.400 --> 49:45.480]  in the hostile territory of Texas under FEMA.
[49:45.480 --> 49:49.320]  Almost all those people there are my listeners or other folks that are already awake.
[49:49.320 --> 49:54.600]  They've already read Reuters and Forbes and the Associated Press and the Army War College.
[49:54.600 --> 49:57.560]  Let me tell you, the average Texan's out there with the Internet.
[49:57.560 --> 49:59.080]  They're on the Pentagon website.
[49:59.080 --> 50:04.280]  The average Texan that's there owns a couple businesses, super hardworking, has a couple
[50:04.280 --> 50:09.960]  degrees, a bunch of people working under them, a lot of refugees from the east and the west,
[50:09.960 --> 50:11.360]  and they understand what's going on.
[50:11.360 --> 50:14.000]  It's why our state's a boom town compared to others.
[50:14.000 --> 50:20.320]  But see, ABC has this thing, we're all a bunch of country bumpkins and the LA Times has got
[50:20.320 --> 50:26.920]  us in cartoons with fingers up our noses and it says, Alex Jones eats boogers, literally,
[50:26.920 --> 50:29.840]  Alex Jones fan and then a kid eating boogers.
[50:29.840 --> 50:33.240]  Well, I guess that proves I'm wrong, huh?
[50:33.240 --> 50:35.360]  Why, you drew a funny picture.
[50:35.360 --> 50:37.400]  That means I'm a liar.
[50:37.400 --> 50:40.640]  I want to take your calls on this subject.
[50:40.640 --> 50:43.000]  Why are they betting everything on Jade Helm?
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.400]  Why are they going so crazy right now when they've had thousands of other drills where
[50:47.400 --> 50:50.080]  the military trains to take our guns on video?
[50:50.080 --> 50:55.400]  See, everybody's seen these just the last month, five or six videos with Army drills
[50:55.400 --> 50:59.880]  with the role-players saying, I'm a gun owner, I'm an American veteran, I'm a tea partier,
[50:59.880 --> 51:01.560]  I'm a sovereign citizen.
[51:01.560 --> 51:06.880]  You can't take my guns as they're billy clubbed or local news.
[51:06.880 --> 51:10.520]  Why do we have armored vehicles here in Spokane for the veterans and gun owners?
[51:10.520 --> 51:13.760]  We're getting ready for a war in Indiana.
[51:13.760 --> 51:15.080]  Sheriff, why do you have the armored vehicles?
[51:15.080 --> 51:19.120]  Well, we've got a lot of veterans where there's a coming war with them.
[51:19.120 --> 51:21.200]  I mean, everybody's like, really, the veterans?
[51:21.200 --> 51:23.880]  And then we're like, hey, the military is trying to take on veterans.
[51:23.880 --> 51:27.360]  Shut up, you hate veterans, you anti-American trash.
[51:27.360 --> 51:29.640]  That Jones is a commie working with the Ruskies.
[51:29.640 --> 51:32.560]  I mean, look, the people watch.
[51:32.560 --> 51:35.120]  Let me explain something to everybody up there in their ivory towers.
[51:35.120 --> 51:40.200]  You're all a bunch of know-it-alls there in Washington, in New York City, and you know,
[51:40.200 --> 51:48.640]  we all have outhouses, and we don't have opposable thumbs, and you just, you know everything.
[51:48.640 --> 51:51.280]  Except most of your families already fled your state because there's no jobs.
[51:51.280 --> 51:56.000]  Listen, you're a cancer, you're a bunch of narcissistic know-it-alls, and thank God you're
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.720]  not as evil or tough as Stalin or Hitler.
[51:59.720 --> 52:01.720]  You're evil, but you're just not tough.
[52:01.720 --> 52:07.400]  You're lazy, you smoke your own political propaganda, you believe your own BS, you're
[52:07.400 --> 52:10.480]  getting high on your own supply, so just keep doing it.
[52:10.480 --> 52:14.600]  Keep telling people there's no Jade Helm than there is, or then say, I'm a liar and I hate
[52:14.600 --> 52:20.160]  troops and I don't, when the military's the one giving us all this intel, you're done.
[52:20.160 --> 52:21.160]  You're done.
[52:21.160 --> 52:26.000]  It won't happen today or even next month or next year, but you're on your way out.
[52:26.000 --> 52:27.080]  Every indicator shows it.
[52:27.080 --> 52:31.240]  So go ahead and throw a big fit, blow some stuff up to blame and honest.
[52:31.240 --> 52:36.880]  Like you did Oklahoma City, the dog don't hunt, the bird doesn't fly, the engine doesn't
[52:36.880 --> 52:37.880]  start.
[52:37.880 --> 52:40.400]  You go ahead and play your hand.
[52:40.400 --> 52:46.480]  Go ahead, go ahead and fill your hand, go ahead, because we're not backing down, scum.
[52:46.480 --> 52:47.480]  You got it.
[52:47.480 --> 52:49.800]  We know we're watching everything you do.
[52:49.800 --> 52:55.120]  We don't believe a word out of your lion fat mouths, you traitor, these pieces of trash
[52:55.120 --> 52:56.120]  collaborators.
[52:56.120 --> 53:00.320]  The sick part is they know what they're doing up there with all their deceptions.
[53:00.320 --> 53:04.160]  It's the same playbook.
[53:04.160 --> 53:05.960]  Let's go ahead and go back to their propaganda.
[53:05.960 --> 53:07.400]  I'm going to play it.
[53:07.400 --> 53:08.880]  Come back in the next hour, take your calls.
[53:08.880 --> 53:13.720]  The number is 877-789-2539, different number than the weekdays.
[53:13.720 --> 53:23.720]  We produced the whole show here in Austin on Sundays, 877-789-ALEX-877-789-ALEX.
[53:23.720 --> 53:28.680]  Let's go back to what was the biggest news show in the country this week with ABC.
[53:28.680 --> 53:29.680]  Now a remnant.
[53:29.680 --> 53:33.080]  In fact, I said it at 50 million viewers, I was looking at it earlier.
[53:33.080 --> 53:36.360]  This show had over 20 million viewers just 10 years ago.
[53:36.360 --> 53:40.040]  Now an average 3.5 million, some weeks 5 million, a mother's day even less.
[53:40.040 --> 53:44.000]  So here they are, the mouths that roars lying to their viewers.
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.760]  They're reason they only have no offense.
[53:47.760 --> 53:53.280]  I went to visit my grandmother today at her assisted living, but that's who you got watching.
[53:53.280 --> 53:55.720]  You've got people at assisted living facilities watching.
[53:55.720 --> 53:56.720]  Here it is.
[53:56.720 --> 54:02.560]  Last week, Texas Governor Greg Abbott called up the Texas State Guard to monitor U.S. troops
[54:02.560 --> 54:08.520]  and protect the constitutional rights of Texans, drawing this wisecrack from John Stewart.
[54:08.520 --> 54:09.520]  Oh dear lord.
[54:09.520 --> 54:12.960]  Oh John Stewart, his brother runs the stock exchange?
[54:12.960 --> 54:14.200]  He's done actual threats.
[54:14.200 --> 54:15.200]  He has a fake name?
[54:15.200 --> 54:16.200]  You should have left us.
[54:16.200 --> 54:17.200]  Oh no, don't do that.
[54:17.200 --> 54:18.200]  Chainsaw Massacre.
[54:18.200 --> 54:19.200]  I'm not in New York right now.
[54:19.200 --> 54:25.600]  But in the Lone Star State, plenty of people are worried, now telling Washington.
[54:25.600 --> 54:28.800]  This week, David Wright, ABC News, New York.
[54:28.800 --> 54:34.560]  Thanks to David, radio talk show host Alex Jones, who as David said has been one of the
[54:34.560 --> 54:39.880]  leading proponents of this theory, had agreed to join us this morning, but he did not show
[54:39.880 --> 54:40.880]  up at our studio.
[54:40.880 --> 54:41.880]  Bravo Sierra.
[54:41.880 --> 54:42.880]  So let's bring back the round table.
[54:42.880 --> 54:43.880]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[54:43.880 --> 54:45.600]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[54:45.600 --> 54:51.120]  I even told Nica, I told him Saturday I said there's a good chance with this weird 6 a.m.
[54:51.120 --> 54:55.160]  time that they're gonna pull games with the car and have it not show up or show up late
[54:55.160 --> 54:57.080]  and claim I didn't make it.
[54:57.080 --> 54:58.760]  I just said tell him we're not doing it.
[54:58.760 --> 54:59.760]  We agreed to live.
[54:59.760 --> 55:02.400]  They broke the agreement and they just don't care.
[55:02.400 --> 55:04.360]  They're going to prey on their victims.
[55:04.360 --> 55:09.240]  They, I mean, this is run by George Stephanopoulos, Bill Clinton's main liar.
[55:09.240 --> 55:12.440]  I mean, you know.
[55:12.440 --> 55:16.760]  So here's the deal ABC, George Stephanopoulos.
[55:16.760 --> 55:22.440]  George Stephanopoulos, I will debate you anytime you want live, punk.
[55:22.440 --> 55:27.280]  Just come out on air and say, I'm debating Alex Jones for 10 minutes live next week.
[55:27.280 --> 55:31.320]  You would actually have 10 million viewers doubling what you have guaranteed guaranteed.
[55:31.320 --> 55:32.320]  You'd have 10 million viewers.
[55:32.320 --> 55:36.960]  Highest ratings, peers Morgan ever had was having me on, but I destroyed his career.
[55:36.960 --> 55:38.120]  It was a dead count bounce.
[55:38.120 --> 55:42.280]  I took him out like gladiator.
[55:42.280 --> 55:43.480]  You put me in the ring with you.
[55:43.480 --> 55:50.920]  I will tear your literal propaganda and testives out and you know it and you're such coward.
[55:50.920 --> 55:57.040]  You got to then lie and say, I'm scared to get in the arena with you.
[55:57.040 --> 56:03.000]  You're like a legless, eyeless, Pomeranian in a fight with a top pit bull.
[56:03.000 --> 56:08.520]  I mean, you really think I'm, I mean, I don't even get vocal and eloquent till I'm in a
[56:08.520 --> 56:10.520]  fight with somebody politically.
[56:10.520 --> 56:11.520]  I'm bragging.
[56:11.520 --> 56:12.520]  It's just a fact.
[56:12.520 --> 56:14.920]  I will clean the floor with you.
[56:14.920 --> 56:15.920]  Come on.
[56:15.920 --> 56:19.600]  Any ABC news show that's live and national, I'm ready.
[56:19.600 --> 56:20.720]  Just open the gate.
[56:20.720 --> 56:23.880]  Let me in there with you, please.
[56:23.880 --> 56:28.880]  Because Morgan rightfully described me in a news article he wrote for the Guardian as
[56:28.880 --> 56:37.800]  a gorilla pacing in its, in its bard enclosure, wanting to get at him.
[56:37.800 --> 56:39.120]  And that's absolutely right.
[56:39.120 --> 56:43.880]  I mean, no one believes that I was scared to come on and, and, and, and, and, and, and
[56:43.880 --> 56:46.040]  debate a bunch of mummies.
[56:46.040 --> 56:47.400]  It goes on for like five more minutes.
[56:47.400 --> 56:48.400]  Let's play another minute of it.
[56:48.400 --> 56:49.400]  Here it is.
[56:49.400 --> 56:55.920]  Our thanks to David radio talk show host Alex Jones, who as David said has been one of the
[56:55.920 --> 57:01.240]  leading proponents of this theory had agreed to join us this morning, but he did not show
[57:01.240 --> 57:02.240]  up at our studio.
[57:02.240 --> 57:05.560]  So let's bring back the round table to weigh in on this.
[57:05.560 --> 57:08.520]  Boy, this got some real legs, this story.
[57:08.520 --> 57:14.520]  And it certainly had to do with Greg Abbott and Ted Cruz talking about it.
[57:14.520 --> 57:15.520]  Rich.
[57:15.520 --> 57:17.280]  Well, they're pandering to a vocal minority.
[57:17.280 --> 57:22.040]  Now I'm an all in favor of a healthy distrust of the government, but not paranoia.
[57:22.040 --> 57:23.200]  There are many threats to our liberty.
[57:23.200 --> 57:24.840]  The U.S. military isn't one of them.
[57:24.840 --> 57:25.840]  Good pause.
[57:25.840 --> 57:26.840]  And besides, federal.
[57:26.840 --> 57:30.880]  And the Roman military wasn't a threat to take over Rome under Julius Caesar.
[57:30.880 --> 57:33.120]  And most third world countries don't fall to the military.
[57:33.120 --> 57:36.080]  And our founders didn't warn us about having a domestic military would take over.
[57:36.080 --> 57:41.240]  The number one threat is always the political class use the military to take over.
[57:41.240 --> 57:42.880]  I mean, that's what Eisenhower said.
[57:42.880 --> 57:46.600]  These people are telling you that up is down, down is up, and black is white, and two plus
[57:46.600 --> 57:47.600]  two equals 100.
[57:47.600 --> 57:48.600]  They're liars.
[57:48.600 --> 57:58.240]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[57:58.240 --> 58:03.200]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[58:03.200 --> 58:05.880]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[58:05.880 --> 58:11.280]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[58:11.280 --> 58:15.800]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[58:15.800 --> 58:20.200]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[58:20.200 --> 58:21.200]  drugs.
[58:21.200 --> 58:25.280]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[58:25.280 --> 58:27.320]  that children would actually like and take.
[58:27.320 --> 58:30.880]  We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for
[58:30.880 --> 58:35.440]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[58:35.440 --> 58:40.440]  Introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and
[58:40.440 --> 58:42.960]  essential nutrients that taste great.

[59:08.360 --> 59:13.360]  The fall and winter months are the most dangerous time of year in North America when it comes
[59:13.360 --> 59:15.120]  to you and your family's health.

[59:52.480 --> 01:00:02.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:08.600]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:11.720]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.080]  Well, there's something big here in Jade Hill.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.640]  The globalists are getting ready to roll out more military on the streets of America.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:25.800]  FBI is showing brace for al-Qaeda attacks, aka ISIS attacks any moment.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:30.840]  I haven't figured out every angle of this yet, but our researchers here at InfoWars,
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:37.400]  David Knight, Jakari Jackson, Rob Do and others dug into the logo, and there it was, mastering
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.400]  the human domain.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:45.120]  It turns out that's the name of an entire Pentagon program fusing domestic intel and
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:51.160]  sociology and anthropology together for domestic takeover, and they admit that and working
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.160]  with local police.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.120]  And we knew from the document a lot of it was domestic, and then they lied and said
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.920]  they never said that in the document.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:04.120]  Man, they're really freaking out over this big time, and they look freaked out when they
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:08.800]  talk about it, and I think there's more to this than I even know.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:15.120]  I don't claim to have all the answers, but we've covered so many military operations,
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.800]  and a lot of them are legitimate, others are treasonous, and we get warned of those by the
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:24.760]  military personnel that are very patriotic and follow their oaths as Americans a lot
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.960]  better than they ever said to some.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:32.240]  And I've said this for a decade, the military is the most awake patriotic group we've got,
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:38.160]  as absolutely horrible as the minority of police are under federal training doing bad
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.160]  things.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.160]  The police are the second most awake group.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:45.040]  That's why Soros wants us to have a civil war with them.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.000]  But something's big here, and I need your help to understand what it is in a brainstorming
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.640]  session here today, because stuff's moving really fast.
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:59.440]  Mark, Chris, TJ, Matt, Jim, Lars, Chris, and others, we're going to go to all of you.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:05.160]  Mark, what do you think's going on here, and why do you think they're acting so deceptive,
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.640]  and why do you think they played all these games about me being on their show?
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:12.600]  I think it was all just so they could claim that they had me on and try to discredit me
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:17.000]  that way that I was a coward or was ashamed of myself and wouldn't defend my ideas.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  What do you think?
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.720]  Ever since I've been listening to you, you've been reporting on all these huge exercises,
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:29.200]  and they have never freaked out like this, so it's definitely really weird that they
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:33.320]  are freaking out on the scale that they are just about this exercise.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:38.080]  Someone that has a lot of information that I'd like you to have on if you could, Dave
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.080]  Hodges.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.240]  Sure, your phone is just starting a little bit.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.240]  Dave who?
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.240]  Dave Hodges.
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.240]  Dave Hodges, okay?
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.240]  Of the common sent shell.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.440]  Okay, what's he saying?
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:54.520]  It's really weird, all these things are lining up at the same time.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:03:00.800]  You've got Rabbi Kahn talking about the Chimita and the financial collapse in September, you
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:05.200]  got the exercise ending in September, you've got a lot of European militaries doing the
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:10.680]  same huge exercise, they're calling it huge scale, at the same exact time that we are.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:15.080]  You've never had this exercise this big, and it's not just special forces, it's a lot
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.520]  of national guard, a lot of regular army.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:22.680]  Oh, well sure, sure, we've got the backdrop of national guard all over the country training
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.680]  for civil unrest against Tea Party.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:32.080]  I mean, we have the video, exactly, there's this whole backdrop, well let me ask you this,
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:37.200]  what do you think J-Home could really be, the smoke screen for preparation?
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:42.400]  If I was going, if I was a military and I was going to institute martial law, you would
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:47.920]  never just wear off the tank and come and do it, you would want to acclimate everybody
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:53.000]  and normalize it by having a big exercise, you would want to put the people at ease at
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  first with normalizing it by having a huge drill, it could go live at any time.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.720]  We're talking about supposedly, I think, talking about how they have soldiers ready
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:09.920]  to go out and do something, you've got weapons missing off of bases now, you've got all sorts
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:15.920]  of, just crazy stuff lining up, stop Bennett, the, I don't know if they're whistleblowers,
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:21.920]  like these army style-offs, he's been talking about this too, and it's all just lining up
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.920]  and it's just creepy that there's a full shot about it.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:28.000]  Exactly, there is so much activity that it's a tent on a record scale, it's like a fire
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:34.320]  ant bed, and I can't see all the angles, all I know is all our sources in the military
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:39.160]  and law enforcement say something big's coming, and I don't know if it's war with Russia, financial
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:43.720]  collapse, massive ISIS attacks all together, it could be one or all those, it could be
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:49.640]  more, great call, thanks for the points Mark, and they want to discredit the liberty movement
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:55.920]  ahead of all this coming out, in fact, I think something just clicked, I think, I think, we'll
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:25.760]  be back, stay with us.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:55.760]  Thank you so much for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:55.760]  Thank you so much for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:25.760]  Thank you so much for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:55.760]  Thank you so much for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:02.320]  I have looked at every angle of this, we're going back to your phone calls in a moment,
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:09.520]  the out of proportion, insane, mega massive, five week response, where Jade Helm, the military
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:16.920]  exercise to be conducted in 10 states, it was to be seven, now it's 10.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:23.440]  I have never seen such a crazy response to it, and so much deception.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.480]  And a lot of people think that means it's something's going to go live during or after
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:33.440]  Jade Helm, I don't know if that's the case, but the way they're trying to brand patriots
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:41.760]  as anti-military, during this is clearly part of the PSYOP itself, just like the previous
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:47.400]  PSYOPs and all the training manuals say, returning vets will attack police departments, will
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:52.840]  attack military bases with no evidence, no proof or no history, it's whole cloth, clearly
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:58.120]  as an investigator, if there are attacks, you go to who said that the patriots were
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:02.600]  going to do it, because they have no history, when those that are demonizing the patriots
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:08.520]  have the motive and kept saying it was coming, I mean, open and shut that you need to have
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:16.480]  prime suspect be the whole Soros Combine, I mean, even Fox News four years ago, we
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:20.040]  ought to do a special report on this, pull all the clips together, went to Democratic
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.360]  party memos that were only going to like billionaires and hundred billionaires and
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:29.360]  a million dollar donors, put you that way, people worth billions.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:32.720]  And it was like, don't worry, don't think we're down, we're going to take over.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:36.640]  The right wing is going to stage terror attacks and we're going to blame it on the general
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:41.600]  conservative movement and we're going to take over and it's paper thin that they're clearly
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:45.680]  talking about false flags in those and we're going to blame talk radio and take it over
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:51.880]  and in free speech and you look at all that and all the preparations and the confidence
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:58.760]  of these people, we come out against Jade Helm, they roll the military out, they have
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:05.440]  provocateurs attack the military, I'm wargaming here, I'm not saying this is news, I'm saying
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.800]  I've really soul searched, I've thought about this, I've prayed about it and then I realized
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:15.640]  just about an hour ago and then again just a few minutes ago that the whole battle
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:19.920]  plan pretty much is clicked in as my prime projection, doesn't mean it's what's going
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:24.720]  to happen, but folks know that usually it is what happens when I break down these analysis
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.920]  because I just live this stuff.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:32.360]  They may attack troops during Jade Helm because they keep saying, isn't this dangerous to
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.160]  have the military out now and these people have lied about them and I kept saying years
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:43.160]  ago they would then attack military during drills, blame us for it and then start the
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:49.600]  civil war that way and then they'll use the giant drill to bootleg putting in their mercenaries
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:55.320]  or foreign forces who will launch the attack with compartmentalization and then it's blamed
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:03.400]  on us and that's how they start the civil war and then they've got me as the main progenitor
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:09.880]  of the whole Jade Helm criticism and then they can criticize Governor Abbott, Ted Cruz,
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:15.640]  Louis Gohmert and others and tie them to it and claim that we hype people up to carry
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:20.240]  out the terror attack against Jade Helm.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.240]  I've got them.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.240]  That's their plan.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.240]  I've got their ass.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.240]  That's it people.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.320]  I'm telling you right now that's their plan.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.440]  I have war game this in my brain.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.600]  I've prayed.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.880]  That is their plan.
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:32.040]  We've got them.
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.480]  That's it.
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.520]  That's why they're so freaked out on these shows, why they're acting like they're on
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.520]  the main bridge, the main attack.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.880]  I mean it's like it's a battle of midway to them.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.120]  They are just shaking because this is it.
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.320]  I can see it in their eyes.
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.480]  They're acting crazy.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.480]  They're acting jumping.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.680]  They're moving folks.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:48.680]  They're moving.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.840]  They're moving and I don't know why I didn't see it sooner.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.040]  Oh my God.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.320]  It's they're about to drop the hammer.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.120]  We've now got it.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.240]  Oh my gosh.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.480]  And this was clicking last night.
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.760]  It was clicking today.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:07.240]  It was clicking last week but I just didn't want to believe it and I just, when that caller
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.480]  was talking it all just crystallized.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:12.680]  Oh my gosh.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.520]  Oh my gosh.
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.760]  This is their plan.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:16.760]  Oh boy.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:21.480]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.440]  Well we've got to think about how to stop it.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.440]  Sabotage it obviously.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:27.440]  We've got to sabotage their plan.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.600]  I mean we have them.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.600]  We have them saying for at least six years that to every police department, veterans
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.360]  will ID you in the near future.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.720]  They will bomb you.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.760]  They will attack with a tea party and massive training for it.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:45.080]  Now they have a giant humid operation for domestic takeover.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.920]  We've now documented that and the reports confirmed on Friday.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.920]  The name is confirmed Jade Helm for domestic operations.
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.600]  We have all the other operations they're admitted as well and so they're rolling it out and
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:13:00.240]  this is how they do it and they use Jade Helm to smoke screen it but now we may have blown
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:04.640]  their operation because when the special forces learn about this and when the regular
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:10.200]  troops learn about it they'll be decompartmentalized and ready to recognize what happens before
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:14.960]  it happens and that may make the enemy pull back during this operation.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:22.520]  Now that's one major vein I know they're preparing for with all the data because there's so many
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:26.800]  pieces of data when you put them together just laying them out without placing them
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:27.800]  where you want.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:28.800]  You just pull back.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.160]  You see where they're laying.
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.520]  It's crystal clear.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:37.600]  This is a major continuum plan.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.880]  There are other plans as well.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.880]  Let's go to one call before we go to break.
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:48.120]  I want to get to everybody here but they are coming after the people.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.120]  This is it.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.560]  TJ in New York, thanks for holding.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.560]  What are you things going on?
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:56.880]  We've got really bad phones today.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.240]  Are people on speaker phones?
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.680]  Can you get off your speakerphone?
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.080]  I'm going to let you go TJ.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.920]  I'm sorry but you can't be on speakerphone.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:07.920]  Matt in New Hampshire.
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:08.920]  Matt you're on the air.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:09.920]  Go ahead.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:10.920]  Good afternoon Alex.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.920]  Can you hear me alright?
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:14.920]  Yes I can.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:15.920]  Go ahead.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.420]  Alex.
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.520]  We may have a phone system problem today.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.520]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:25.880]  We're going to find out there in the break what's going on with our... yeah I'm sorry
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:26.880]  Matt.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:27.880]  Alex.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:32.040]  Put them on hold.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.160]  Go over this a little bit later we're going to figure out.
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:38.600]  We don't do the show out of the studio but once a week anymore and I heard the same distortion
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:43.120]  on all those calls so I think we've had folks in here using the equipment for voiceovers.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.440]  Yeah we have an issue.
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.960]  Our phone system's got a problem today.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.760]  Well I apologize to the listeners.
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:55.200]  We'll try to line that up and get you on after the break.
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.720]  This stuff happens occasionally to anybody.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:01.680]  I've seen Larry King back in the day had problems with his phone system so we'll try to figure
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:02.960]  that out as best we can.
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:07.320]  We'll pre-test it beforehand now and we will go to break here in a minute and come back
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:10.800]  with you but this is epic information folks.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:18.800]  We have video from Illinois, from Tennessee, from California, from Texas, from Utah just
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.800]  pouring in.
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:25.560]  We've been playing in all last week where they're training the military.
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:31.520]  No guard, regular army, Marine Corps, you name it, to take on veterans, gun owners,
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:35.080]  conservatives, libertarians because in the role playing they scream, you know, I'm a
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.920]  gun owner and you can't take my rights or you can't take my farm.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.320]  I mean they're preparing for this war.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:47.760]  All of this is going on and then now we've got media acting like we're crazy if we mention
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.920]  it but telling the military prepare and police departments for veterans to attack you with
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:57.760]  no proof you can really see where this is all leading and I'm trying to get inside their
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.560]  mind.
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:05.320]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems, introducing
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:11.040]  the new InfoWarsLife.com oil of oregano formulation, we have now procured the most high quality

[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:22.320]  on the tongue.

[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:35.480]  For the last two years I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist and chemist

[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.640]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:01.640]  Good brother.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:05.120]  Just recently started using your products, everything you said about them is correct,
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:09.240]  me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:12.920]  Well thank you brother because it also funds our operation but doing that I know I've got
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.280]  to have the highest quality.
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:20.440]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.440]  of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:27.600]  We did a super male and a super female vitality, big changes, a lot of energy, we've gotten
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:32.120]  off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:37.840]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated or
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.640]  maximum potency.
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:44.040]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:48.720]  but then burn you out in my experience whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:51.760]  goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:57.680]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.680]  from InfoWarsLife.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:04.080]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:07.600]  What are the health effects of having these drugs and our drinking water?
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.520]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:14.360]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:18.000]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.880]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.400]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:32.040]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:36.000]  Fluoride is intense in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.680]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.200]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.560]  It's time to take action.
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.480]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:06.400]  In the near future, when you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball...
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:12.920]  Security alert, this is Homeland Security, analysis infowars building independent media
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:13.920]  operation.
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:18.480]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:21.080]  Prime Directive discredit Alex Jones.
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.840]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:27.160]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:29.480]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:31.080]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.080]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:38.240]  They are never going to stop, they are never going to deviate from their program until
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.240]  we stop them.

[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.240]  This is the minute to TV.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.240]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.240]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.240]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.240]  You can fail it.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:20:12.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:23.480]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:29.160]  Bottom line, there's giant paramilitary preparations by the police of the military to take on the
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.400]  American people.
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:35.640]  The military and police have actually raised the alarm, given us incredible information
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:36.920]  and others over the years.
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:39.480]  That's why we're having a debate about it now.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:44.240]  I was talking to CJ during the break, one of the producers of the show, and CJ, you
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:49.120]  were saying basically what you think the whole plan is and why they're hyping us up, because
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:54.200]  we've covered hundreds of operations and always said it's just part of an incremental conditioning.
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:58.240]  Why are they freaking out so much right now and misrepresenting what we're saying?
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:03.000]  I think the worst thing that could possibly happen would be something like a Patsy being
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:09.920]  set up and going out and shooting a G.I. out in a hayfield and wearing an M4s.com shirt
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:14.520]  and making us look that much kookier.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.920]  Because they've already gone to shootings before where they were our enemies doing it,
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:22.200]  like the Poplowski guy that shot three cops, a white supremacist who stalked us, hated
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.880]  us, said he was going to kill us.
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.920]  They said he killed the cops for me.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:31.800]  Within two hours of his arrest, now I forced a retraction in seven newspapers because it
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.720]  wasn't true, threatening to sue them, but you're absolutely right.
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:36.760]  That's where this is all going.
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:42.960]  Backdrop, that Bastrop little meet and greet they had, people wearing M4s.com shirts, not
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:43.960]  just our reporters.
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:47.880]  Well, I mean, they've got us in hundreds of papers a day now.
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:51.880]  They've never given us as much attention branding us now and connecting us to this.
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.240]  They're making their move.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.880]  They're making their stand on Jade Helm.
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:22:00.160]  And I'm telling you, folks, they're doing this as part of a larger program.
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:03.080]  They've got something big planned.
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:06.400]  And then I look at all the police training manuals, they say, you will face veterans.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.280]  They will attack you soon.
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.280]  They will bomb you.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.280]  They will kill you.
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:13.640]  And they tell the military that to the military is like, veterans are going to kill me.
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:18.640]  But see, then they have black ops attack the military during a drill.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.400]  Most of it's a legitimate drill.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.320]  Then the new enemies, the Patriots, they buy into this.
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:26.640]  But the military sees through it, most of them, I don't see this working.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:33.200]  All right, I want to go to Matt, Jonathan, Aaron, Jim, Lars, Chris, Peter, Chris and
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.200]  others.
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:39.120]  Earlier, we had a phone computer problem, but it's fixed now, I'm told.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.440]  Matt is saying he's in New Hampshire and seeing military drills there.
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:43.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:48.040]  Jade Helm doesn't start until August, but it's already going on.
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:49.040]  This is already happening.
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:52.720]  And every video we get is taking on Patriots.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.200]  So what are you seeing, Matt?
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:58.040]  Well, Alex, there is a lot of activity up here.
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:04.640]  I actually saw online yesterday, 20 miles from my house, I've driven by the shop.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:12.120]  There is a armored vehicle with military guys at either National Guard or it's the military
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:18.880]  sitting there in full dress with helmets on, poking their heads out right downtown Merrimack,
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.880]  New Hampshire.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:20.880]  Okay.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:26.000]  So that was actually a photo that was taken by someone that had sent it to that guy, David
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.880]  Hodges site that the previous caller was mentioning, but at the same time, Alex, down here at
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:36.280]  the National Guard, I live in Manchester and this is that city.
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:41.760]  You guys had run an article, it was about seven months ago, about a grandmother that
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:42.760]  got shot.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:45.600]  They were in a drug bust, okay?
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:53.360]  And there, the National Guard here in New Hampshire, their annex is filling up with equipment,
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:58.960]  with generators, with the Humvees and there is so much stuff there.
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:23:59.960]  Oh, I know.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:05.440]  But listen, they admit under FEMA, under Northcom, generators, weapons, armored vehicles, tanks,
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:09.080]  rocket launchers, machine guns, they're pre-caching them all.
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:13.680]  And then they have these public training events where they admit it's for the Patriots and
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:14.680]  the veterans.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:18.280]  That's what the veterans do, except get put on, don't treat death list.
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:19.280]  Right.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.080]  And go out and go out and work for us.
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.080]  You know what I mean?
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:24.560]  And that's the whole point.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:29.840]  I think one of the reasons why they're trying to really, they're throwing rocks at you right
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:35.600]  now really hard, Alex, is due to the fact that you guys have been talking about being
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.320]  over the target.
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:42.160]  And I think that they're really trying to discredit you because if enough people start
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:47.440]  making noise about this, I think you're actually throwing a wrench right in the gears in their
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.440]  quarts.
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:49.440]  Well, let's be clear.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:50.440]  I'm not throwing a wrench.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:51.600]  You the listeners are.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:56.320]  And other talk show hosts that wish they were getting this much attention, it is not fun
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.480]  to be stuck in the fiery furnace.
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:04.880]  Believe me, when you look at political operatives on ABC Sunday shows and they're shaking and
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:08.440]  look like they're passing an anvil, you know, out of there.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:09.440]  You know what?
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.320]  I mean, they're freaked out.
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:13.720]  They know something we don't know.
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:17.280]  Something big is coming and the pucker factor is off the chart.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.280]  But I hear you.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:22.840]  We did find some of the photos of the trainloads of MRAPs you were talking about being deployed
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.840]  against us.
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:28.280]  If America wasn't concerned, we'd be crazy.
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:31.480]  And America is finally starting to realize we're in trouble.
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:34.440]  I mean, the president's operating as a dictator.
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.520]  I don't want to fight with the president.
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:41.280]  I don't want to fight with the FBI and the government, but it's been seized.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:47.880]  I mean, it's overthrowing the whole republic, lying about everything as a citizen, as a
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:48.880]  person who loves freedom.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:53.000]  I have a duty to speak out against this.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.400]  And I'm just sad because it's crazy.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.080]  I mean, what's going on is crazy.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.960]  Thank you, Matt.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:04.800]  Peter is active duty military out of Fort Bragg.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.800]  Thanks for holding.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:06.800]  You were calling.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.800]  What is your take on this?
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:11.080]  Oh, hey, Alex.
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.880]  My big thing is when I first heard this, because I don't really exclude some of the mainstream
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:17.080]  media too much.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.400]  I do check up on it once in a while.
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:23.040]  But I originally thought you were blowing, Jerry, how am I proportioned?
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:28.880]  Because anybody who's been at Bragg for more than a day knows about Robin Fage, which is
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:32.640]  the Special Forces Q-Course for 50 years.
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:33.640]  For 50 years.
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:34.640]  Yeah.
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:35.640]  Exactly.
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:38.920]  I mean, I honestly thought you were blowing, Jerry, how am I proportioned?
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:44.960]  And then the mainstream media and how they reacted was kind of like, blow me away because
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:47.960]  you've gone over a million of these over the years.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:51.600]  Why is jade hell more special than all the other training exercises they've done over
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:52.600]  the years?
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:57.160]  What do you think is going on?
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.680]  Honestly, I have no idea.
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:02.800]  This is what's weirding me out a lot.
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:06.840]  But my big thing is, how do they not know?
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:11.320]  How many discussions do I have at work with people who are like, well, why would we confiscate
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.320]  guns?
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:15.760]  Am I going to go to my own house and take my own weapon?
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:22.040]  The act of duty military is full of people who are gun owners, deployment veterans.
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.880]  We fit into all that stuff.
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:24.880]  Exactly.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:29.560]  So war game, war game from a globalist perspective, how do you convince the military who's the
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:33.080]  most patriotic, best people we've got, it's just true.
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:36.760]  How do you convince them to then have war?
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:41.240]  You stage an event and then make it like the people hate the military, then you attack
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:44.400]  the military and try to get a civil war going.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.040]  I mean, I'm trying to figure this out.
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:51.080]  Honestly, the only way, because generally, there's all walks away from the military,
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:54.920]  it's a cross section of America, but generally it's more conservative than anything.
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:28:00.240]  I would actually venture to say that you would have to ramp up all these rights and things
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:06.880]  in Baltimore and first hand that they have been doing, because for them to be like, well,
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:11.680]  I'm going to go take on the same type of people that I grew up around and then join the military
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:16.600]  and work day in and day out, doesn't make any sense to me.
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:17.600]  I hear you.
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.640]  There's a major mystery here.
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:21.480]  I'm trying to figure out what's happening.
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:22.600]  I'll be honest with people.
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:28.440]  I don't, I don't know exactly what's going on, but I have a good idea and it doesn't
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:29.440]  look good.
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:30.440]  God bless you.
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:31.440]  Appreciate your call.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.440]  Skip's a truck driver.
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.280]  We've seen a lot of equipment moving around.
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:35.800]  We'll talk to him next.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:39.640]  Alex is from Russia, has seen Jade home take place in his country before.
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:43.240]  Chris has comments on mainstream media and the Hux of ABC report.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.840]  I've never finished playing that.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:49.320]  Jim doesn't know why Alex is letting people get him upset.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:52.720]  Aaron says he wrote some article calling me a chicken.
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:55.080]  Oh my gosh, don't call me a chicken.
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.080]  You're right.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.200]  You're right.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:01.000]  I'm scared to go on here.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.400]  Texas rep Louie Gohmert is joining a long list of congressmen who are actually doing
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:09.320]  their job and addressing the concerns of their citizens.
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:14.640]  Gohmert says he understands the concerns Texans have about the upcoming Jade helm exercise.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:20.120]  The congressman took particular issue with the maps labeling of Republican majority states
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:21.120]  as hostile.
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:26.360]  Gohmert called on the Pentagon to change the map, the names on the map and said the tone
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:31.960]  of the exercise needs to be completely revamped so the federal government is not intentionally
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:35.560]  practicing war against its own states.
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:40.840]  Former Texas governor and potential presidential candidate Rick Perry has some different thoughts
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:41.840]  though.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:47.040]  Gohmert said it's okay to question your government, but the military is something else.
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:50.360]  Leigh Ann McAddy reporting for Info Wars Nightly News.

[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:58.840]  Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:03.320]  I am Mark Hattie, I want more videos here, why why why?
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:08.800]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:13.040]  formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:16.200]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:21.160]  Television music, fast food, GMOs, sugars you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:25.680]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:30.200]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:31.200]  drugs.
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:35.120]  Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.160]  that children would actually like and take.
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:40.720]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:45.320]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:50.280]  Introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.840]  essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:09.800]  the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:14.600]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:19.800]  infowarslife, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:24.920]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:30.320]  ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:34.840]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:39.720]  Oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:46.000]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.720]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of super oxide and ozonide technology.

[01:32:56.320 --> 01:33:02.920]  call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:22.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:49.360]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:52.400]  What is happening with infowars?
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.480]  Who's this Alex Jones guy?
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:59.200]  I'm just an average person that doesn't want to be a slave, I've done my research, America
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:02.920]  is sliding into a tyranny, who can deny that?
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:07.600]  And I'm nonpartisan, I just want my bill of rights back.
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:11.520]  Who can deny it's being dismantled?
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:17.040]  And now we've covered hundreds of military operations, hundreds, many of them for domestic
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:21.560]  takeover, that's admitted.
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:27.120]  And now they've picked Jade Helm to stake everything on.
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.440]  What's happening, what's going on, we're taking your calls.
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:36.240]  I haven't aired all of ABC's this week where they ran this whole hoax that I didn't show
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:40.880]  up when I said I'd come on because I was scared and Montell Williams went out and a bunch
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:48.280]  of other talk show hosts are saying nanny booboo, Alex is hiding, he's discredited, he's afraid
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:50.800]  to cover any of the issues.
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:55.080]  This is the type of fake victories they engage in.
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:59.520]  It's like Amazon working with the White House, delisting every conservative and libertarian
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:01.560]  website from the ratings.
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:05.720]  When the ratings are going up, according to Google Analytics and every other system we
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:11.160]  have analyzing it, whether it's Trudge or WorldNet Daily or the Daily Caller, they just
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:16.200]  say no, our ratings are down by 70%.
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:20.560]  It'd be like giving yourself a degree or something.
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:26.240]  MSNBC's mad that we've got a thousand points higher in the rankings, thousand points, than
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:30.240]  them just pay Amazon to flip the numbers.
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:38.640]  Or just don't set up an interview with Alex Jones and say you did and then say he's afraid.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:41.560]  I mean, don't you think they'd put me on all these shows?
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:46.400]  No, they're afraid because I run over them, dominate.
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:48.040]  It becomes a huge news issue.
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:50.080]  Their show gets higher ratings for a whole week.
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:51.280]  They don't want that.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:54.600]  They want to push their line of bull.
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:59.440]  Member Pears Morgan?
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:04.600]  I mean, does anyone believe that I was actually scared to go on?
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:07.800]  I'm going to give you about a minute, Aaron.
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:10.400]  We're not here to plug your website.
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:11.400]  I don't care if you plug it.
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:12.720]  I think I've seen it before.
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:20.600]  The point is, is that do you actually, Aaron, believe that I was scared to go on this week
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:24.440]  with Stephanopoulos or his doppelganger?
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:27.560]  Do you actually believe that as a human being?
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:28.560]  Go ahead.
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:34.320]  So no facts, you're going to make a chicken noise.
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:37.760]  You actually believe I'm scared to go on mainstream television?
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:40.200]  Yeah, because you've never wanted to be.
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:41.200]  You can't handle it.
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.160]  You blow up and you know it.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.680]  So instead, how about a solution?
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:51.640]  I say you send Joe Biggs and the Leigh Ann, the Latina Macadoo out there and let them,
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:55.840]  if you're too jaded and that's what you're basically saying, pardon the pun, because
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:56.840]  you've done it all.
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:57.840]  You've seen it all.
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:58.840]  But some people haven't.
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:36:59.840]  They need to be experienced.
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:03.840]  And then no, I use a story for you.
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:04.840]  Okay.
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:10.000]  So you are, because I mean, we have the emails, we have the texts, they're on infowarch.com,
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.440]  dirty tricks, ABC, Clint of Alkshowns, no show as a hoax.
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:20.960]  You actually believe that I was scared to go do a TV interview?
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:22.960]  That's right.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:23.960]  Okay, good.
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:24.960]  I appreciate your call.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:25.960]  Thank you.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:26.960]  Thank you.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:27.960]  Absolutely.
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:33.800]  It's so scary to sit in a chair with a camera aimed at you like I'm doing right now and
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:37.800]  quote Eisenhower about the military industrial complex.
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:43.200]  And to talk about and hold up news articles, I was looking forward to it, but it shows
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:49.280]  the intellectual dishonesty of somebody like you to create fake victories for yourself.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:54.760]  But I should be glad that you're so delusional because we'll beat you because you are delusional.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:55.760]  Thank you.
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:01.280]  Here's that last caller, Aaron, good job, Aaron.
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.280]  Good job.
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:03.280]  That's right.
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:06.440]  Hey, why don't you just announce that you just won the ND 500?
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:12.520]  You didn't, but just announce it or just announce that you trailblazed like Lewis and Clark.
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:17.920]  You actually discovered the Western passage or you were the first man to walk on the moon.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:20.360]  I mean, live in delusion.
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:23.520]  Tell us that socialism works.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:28.160]  You're not concerned that they stage stuff to act like I was scared to go on TV because
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:33.240]  no one dares say my name on the news or debate me because they know I'll literally destroy
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:35.520]  them.
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.640]  Unbelievable.
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:39.640]  Unbelievable.
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:40.640]  Skip in Texas.
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:41.640]  Truck driver.
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:43.320]  What's your take on all this?
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:48.320]  Oh, my take is, you should have threw some foghorn leghorn on him.
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:51.120]  I said, whoa there, boy.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:39:00.320]  I say, I say, I say, you're afraid to go on the TV with a bunch of pinheads, I say.
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:07.280]  I have seen all sorts of militaries deployed for the last 10 years.
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:14.480]  Starting up West, they had, I first noticed railroad cars for Harlem prisoners.
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:19.120]  This was somewhere up about 80, about 10 years ago.
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:23.840]  They had a bob wire and everything, but for the past four or five years, I've watched
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:30.240]  it come out of Texas because I've just been running up and down 10s from Florida to California.
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:34.680]  Primarily coming out of Katie, Texas, they built these, it was a BAE systems out here
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:38.120]  that shipped this stuff everywhere, but they've since closed that.
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:39.120]  No, I've seen this.
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:47.640]  It's like little single person prison modules, videotape nationwide on the back of boxcars,
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:48.640]  just all over the country.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:49.640]  Yeah.
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:54.880]  It's a huge Manhattan level, bigger project going on right in front of us and they don't
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:57.280]  want us to discuss it.
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:05.720]  And today I've seen probably half a mile of tanks and just military armored vehicles
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:06.920]  being shipped on a train.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:11.160]  I was, I seen that out of Lord'sburg, New Mexico, heading West.
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:14.240]  Last week, seeing about the same thing, I took some pictures.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:15.840]  I know the pictures are all over the web.
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:16.840]  God bless you.
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:19.640]  I hear that last caller making a joke about all this.
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:23.960]  Well, it's probably somebody from ABC.
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:24.960]  God bless you, brother.
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:25.960]  Thank you, Skip.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:26.960]  Keep getting those photos out.
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:29.960]  Send them to showtipsandinfowords.com.
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:32.240]  Alex in New York says he's from Russia.
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:34.560]  He's seen Jade Helm take place in his country before.
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:35.560]  Go ahead.
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.560]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:38.560]  Good, brother.
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:39.560]  Go ahead.
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:40.560]  What do you think of all this?
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:41.560]  Let me explain small points.
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:52.560]  I'm being in a situation when I saw, let's say, a really simple, yesterday I have enough
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:58.280]  money to buy it in my account in the bank to buy a used goods car.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:04.240]  Next morning I wake up today, there's money enough money to buy a pair of pants.
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:07.800]  That's what exactly happened in Russia.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:12.880]  That's what's left of why people were crazy about it.
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:13.880]  I think I heard what you said.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:15.920]  Let me translate it for folks.
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:18.840]  You were in Russia and one day you could buy a car with your bank account, the next day
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:22.360]  you couldn't buy a package of pens, that'll make people go crazy.
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:27.640]  Yeah, because people lost everything, all money, all savings, everything except to have
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:28.640]  a cash.
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:35.040]  And another point, in Russia, if you have single bullets in a pocket, you're going to
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:40.160]  present three years minimum, unless you have a hunting license.
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:46.240]  If you don't, you're going to present just one bullet in a pocket or in a car, or also
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:51.520]  they can found the bullet in a freaking house, then, same story, you're going to present
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:52.520]  minimum.
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:53.520]  Sure.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:58.280]  So what do you think of Jay and Helm and what you see happening to America?
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:07.120]  I'm afraid that we'll call up, and that's why they tried to do it.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:08.120]  I agree with you.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:12.920]  They got the military out, not just Jay and Helm everywhere, trying to go after the Liberty
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:13.920]  movement.
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:14.920]  What do you think of that?
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:24.720]  As I said, I'm right now in upstate New York, and they have a cute military base around
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:35.720]  the area right now, I saw a line of trucks loaded with military equipment, Humvees driving
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:40.960]  all the way down to the south of New York City.
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:44.800]  I don't know exactly where they're going to stop, but they're going down south.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:45.800]  That's right.
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:46.800]  There's an unprecedented movement.
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:48.080]  God bless you, Alex from New York.
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:49.080]  Thank you.
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:54.240]  Jim, Chris, Ed, Jonathan, Jason, and others, we're going to take your calls in the final
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:55.760]  segment straight ahead.
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:43:00.040]  We're simply being ever vigilant to restore the Republic.
[01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:04.400]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:07.960]  What are the health effects of having these drugs and our drinking water?
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:10.880]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:14.720]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:18.360]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:22.280]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:26.760]  New filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:31.920]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:32.920]  All right.
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:36.400]  It is intense in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:39.080]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:40.600]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.960]  It's time to take action.
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.880]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:03.360]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide.
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:09.120]  I'll also enjoy what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:13.200]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:17.520]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:22.840]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:29.240]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at infowarstore.com.
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:34.360]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:36.480]  that so many other coffees give me personally.

[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:18.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:22.680]  It's always a tough vote because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:25.160]  mean that we're running up our debt.
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:29.920]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not increase our
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:30.920]  debt.
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:34.080]  It does not somehow promote profligacy.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:39.320]  All it does is it says, you've got to pay the bills that you've already racked up, Congress.
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:43.680]  I never even aired the whole newscast where they kept just saying I was scared to show
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:45.880]  up and Alex Jones isn't here.
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:50.280]  We wish we could talk to him when they lied and said they'd have me on live and they wouldn't
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:54.880]  so I said forget the interview and they showed up right before the show started to pick me
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:59.480]  up when there was no way to even get to the studio, just their little games because all
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:05.360]  they do is just sit around thinking about how to deceive and manipulate all day long.
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:09.720]  So I challenge ABC News, anytime you want, come park a satellite truck out here at my
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:14.440]  office, I'll sit out there five hours a day debating every show you've got, I'll clean
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:18.480]  your clocks, I'll destroy you, let's go.
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:21.120]  But no, you won't do that, you'll just say I'm scared to show up.
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.480]  That's what cowards do.
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:29.280]  They don't win the real gladiatorial event, they just put it in the newspaper they did.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:31.680]  Let's talk to Jim, Chris, Ed, and others.
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:33.880]  Jim, you're on the air from South Texas.
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:34.880]  Go ahead.
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:36.520]  How are you today, Alex?
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:37.520]  Good, brother.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:41.880]  Yeah, I just wanted to tell you, you know, I think a lot of what you've done as far as
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:47.280]  the studying what's been taking place is a good thing when it comes to Tate Helm because
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:52.920]  if we had something like this happen back around the time of 9-11, I think things might
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:56.840]  have turned out a little bit different with a bunch of Saudi Arabians flying planes into
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:57.840]  our buildings.
[01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:02.400]  Well, you're right, there were a bunch of military drills before and on 9-11 and nobody
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:03.400]  looked at them.
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:07.640]  Well, I wanted to get the, before I forget, I just want to give you some information.
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:16.520]  If you go to YouTube, just plug in Ranger Retires because of Obama and States America's future.
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:21.360]  It's an hour and four minutes long, the gentleman is currently a deputy in St. Louis, Missouri
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:22.360]  area.
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:27.480]  He was ahead of all Army Rangers during the theaters of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:30.960]  His best friend was ahead of Mersock at the same time.
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:33.840]  You might want to take a look at that video of where we might be listening to this program.
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:36.840]  If you really want to know the truth about what's going on from the other side.
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:38.840]  I will look at it, but give us a synopsis.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:40.840]  What does he talk about?
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.680]  It's called World Government.
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:44.200]  It's called Agenda 21.
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:49.200]  It's called the plan having to start to take place in 2015, the 10 regions in the United
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:53.000]  States, which are basically encompassing our country.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  It sets up the other nine regions throughout the world.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.800]  It goes through a lot of different things that have been talked about on the outside
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:07.320]  by so-called conspiracy theorists, but actually coming from somebody that's inside that actually
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:08.320]  was a part of it.
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:09.320]  Well, I'll tell you, it's true.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.840]  I mean, we're here.
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:11.840]  There's treaties.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:12.840]  We're under World Government.
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:14.480]  We're going into it right now.
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:17.000]  That's why everything's accelerating and it's crazy.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  God bless you.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.400]  I just feel sorry for all the traders that have been part of this.
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:23.560]  I mean, it's all real.
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:27.520]  We don't know exactly what's going to happen, but we know major stuff is coming down.
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:29.720]  Let's talk to Chris at Indiana.
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:30.720]  Thank you, Jim.
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:31.720]  Go ahead, Chris.
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:37.320]  Hey, Alex, and happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there.
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:38.320]  Go ahead.
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:39.320]  Thank you.
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:43.480]  Hey, you know that Aaron Caller, first of all, I can tell that he's an everyday listener
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:47.680]  and he's just trying to call in to provoke you, to be mad, so just don't get upset about
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:48.680]  him.
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:53.000]  Just ignore him because I'm an everyday listener for the past six years and I've heard him
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.560]  call in periodically and just ignore him, please, Alex, and don't give him too much
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:50:59.560]  credit.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:00.560]  No, I know.
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:04.720]  It's just that who really believes that I didn't want to go on a big morning show and
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:05.720]  debate these people?
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:06.720]  I love it.
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:11.360]  I wish I'd have been there, but they never responded and they said it was taped and then
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:14.640]  they showed up 12 minutes before and then now I have to sit here and hear people say
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:18.240]  that I was scared to go and it doesn't even make me mad.
[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:19.240]  It makes me sick.
[01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:20.240]  Go ahead.
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:26.560]  I don't believe that for a second and I gotta tell you what, just like your buddy Dave Mustaine,
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:31.840]  who can rip off and improvise guitar solo at any moment, the system is scared because
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:39.640]  they know that you have the vocal cords to rip off a rant on the soapbox of liberty at
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:45.560]  any moment, just like Dave Mustaine can rip off a super good guitar solo.
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:49.160]  You have great improvisional skills and the system knows that.
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:58.200]  You got a gun on your back at San Antonio at the LMO and give me liberty or give me death.
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:51:59.200]  They know that.
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:02.560]  They're scared and they don't want that going out.
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:06.840]  I got a buddy of mine that I turned on that I turned on to you and he's an everyday listener
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:10.560]  and he's even more of a patriot to me now and it was just only a couple months ago I
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:11.560]  mentioned it to him.
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:12.960]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:13.960]  I'm nobody special.
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:16.720]  I just woke up 20-something years ago.
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:17.720]  Patriots are waking up everywhere.
[01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:19.680]  It's like coming out of a deep sleep.
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:20.680]  That's what scares them.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:21.760]  Did you see the show?
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:26.560]  How freaked out they all looked and how the hosts look completely whacked out of her mind.
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:28.560]  I mean, something big's coming.
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:31.280]  They've been let in on something and they're scared.
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:34.720]  What do you think it is?
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:39.360]  It's just that they're so scared they see the ratings dropping and they see that's why
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:43.880]  Alexa's got to pledge all the numbers and everything because they don't want the following.
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:45.800]  I saw that a few months ago.
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:46.800]  What the heck?
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:50.800]  Like a year ago, Info Wars was like 300 in the US rankings.
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:52.680]  Now it's dropped to like 1200.
[01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:56.840]  I don't understand why that happened and then you flushed all that out in the past couple
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:58.440]  weeks and that explains it.
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:03.720]  Our numbers now is like number 160 according if we add the Google numbers to the old Alexa
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:06.560]  numbers, but it doesn't even hurt us.
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:08.480]  It just shows they're crazy.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:11.440]  I mean, they really are going for broke.
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:16.160]  Yeah, and they're just scared.
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:21.600]  They see how we're on an upturn and they're on a downturn and obviously this isn't going
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:26.000]  to be an overnight thing, but they see the trend and hey, happy Mother's Day, Alex.
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.440]  I'll get to the next caller.
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:28.440]  God bless you, brother.
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:29.440]  Appreciate your call.
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:30.920]  Add in Hollywood, California.
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:31.920]  Go ahead.
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:32.920]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:33.920]  Hey, brother.
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:42.200]  What I was thinking about earlier was you were trying to pin it down to one particular
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:44.480]  purpose.
[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:47.600]  I don't think there's one particular purpose to this.
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:54.160]  I think a lot of different factions of the government and the military have all put in
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:54:03.880]  their little agenda and none of it's good, but I don't even think they know exactly
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:04.880]  what they're doing.
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:08.520]  I think they're still putting this together.
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:11.520]  It's not even in final production yet.
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:12.520]  I agree.
[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:16.560]  And then now everyone's watching it, so they're trying to figure out how to edit what they
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:19.440]  were going to do beforehand.
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:26.040]  And their whole story was flimsy from the very beginning that they were going to do
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:31.480]  this for domestic or foreign battles.
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:33.480]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:38.240]  They're trying to make us believe something that is not possible.
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:44.360]  Well, everybody knows the NSA spying illegally and we have militarized police and the military
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:49.520]  is training for a homeland mission against the evil veterans, and that's their words.
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:51.320]  Then they just try to go, nothing's going on.
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:52.320]  You're crazy.
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:53.720]  How dare you ask questions?
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:55.760]  How dare the governor ask questions?
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:55:00.720]  That's what freaks them out, though, is the political class that aren't total traders
[01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:05.840]  realize that the majority's waking up, so they're siding with us right now, and that's
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:08.400]  what sending them into conniption fits.
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:09.400]  Sure.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:12.240]  Well, the NSA is one of the factions.
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:13.240]  Yes.
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:17.280]  John almost got his agenda.
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:19.560]  The military has their agenda.
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:22.520]  I don't even think they know what's going to happen.
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:28.360]  This is a big giant extravaganza that's gotten out of control, and it might make a difference
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:31.680]  to keep at it, keep hammering it.
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:33.520]  Really smart caller, smarter than I am.
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:35.000]  Thank you so much, Ed.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.200]  Jonathan in Kansas, though we're not in Kansas anymore, Jonathan is.
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:41.480]  Jonathan, what do you think's going on?
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:43.520]  Yellowstone Volcano.
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:49.320]  Well, they do say that's set to blow up, but the next hundred years or so, you think it's
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:50.880]  going to be a natural disaster?
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:55.360]  Well, there's been earthquakes all over the United States, 4.0, there was even one in
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:56.360]  Kalamazoo yesterday.
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:01.200]  Yeah, there was even one in Kalamazoo this week.
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:07.880]  And first of all, the hotspot where the Yellowstone Volcano first started is now all the way into
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:09.880]  the Juan de Fuca plate, and it's starting to erupt.
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:13.320]  I saw that on MotherboardTopVice.com.
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:20.320]  So if that entire area from the end of my 250 miles outside of Oregon, all the way inland
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:26.960]  to Yellowstone blows at once, then that would be like the worst disaster ever.
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:33.360]  No kidding, it'll cover basically all of Conus in several feet of molten ash.
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:35.680]  That'll kill basically everybody.
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:42.560]  And that's maybe for the near way ahead future, but there was also something at the end of
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:45.920]  this month, a natural disaster that might be occurring that I've been hearing rumors
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:50.480]  about that I've been doing stuff about, and it's kind of loosely based on Nostradamus.
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:54.360]  I don't know if it's a trading thing about it or not, but that was another thing too,
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:58.920]  is that maybe all these natural disasters coming up if the military was out on their
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:02.760]  J-Town emphasizes and something happened, then they'd be in a pretty low position to
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:03.760]  take over.
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:08.240]  Well, I agree, but I mean, I don't think Jade Helm itself was that big of a deal.
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:11.880]  It was just one more conditioning process.
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:15.120]  It's their response to it that really makes me question what's happening.
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:18.720]  I'm sorry to other callers, Jason and others, we're out of time.
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:22.400]  Lord Willings, I don't take anything for granted in this climate, we'll be back tomorrow
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:27.360]  live, 11 a.m. Central Standard Time with a weekday transmission.
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:32.480]  Great job to the crew coming in on Sunday and all of you tuning in.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:34.080]  Jade Helm is huge.
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:38.080]  The response to it, the media, all of it, this is big, we're going to continue to try
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:42.880]  to investigate and find out exactly why they're going so crazy and why they're attacking us.
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:44.040]  God bless you all.
[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:45.960]  Get out there and warn somebody today.
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:50.440]  People are really ready to be awakened right now.
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:55.200]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems, introducing
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:58.880]  the new InfoWarsLife.com, oil of oregano formulation.

[01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:20.000]  call 888-253-3139.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  Alex Jones here.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.360]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist and chemist
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:30.880]  to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life changing health benefits.
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:34.840]  Introducing the all new ancient defense herbal immunity blend.
[01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:39.880]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting
[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:42.720]  new advances in nutraceutical science.
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:47.720]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:48.720]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:49.720]  I am Mark Hattie.
[01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:52.720]  I will reveal this line, line, line.
[01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:58.480]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical
[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:02.720]  formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:05.440]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:10.840]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:15.360]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:19.720]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:20.720]  drugs.
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:24.840]  And with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:26.880]  that children would actually like and take.
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:30.440]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for
[01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:35.000]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:40.000]  Introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.040]  essential nutrients that taste great.
[01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:45.840]  Obtain your child ease today at InfoWarsLife.com.
