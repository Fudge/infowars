[00:00.000 --> 00:14.800]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation, it's Owenshroyer.
[00:14.800 --> 00:19.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:19.360 --> 00:24.960]  That's right, filling in for Alex today.
[00:24.960 --> 00:26.240]  I'm your host, Owenshroyer.
[00:26.240 --> 00:32.560]  I am sure we'll be hearing from Alex and we have all kinds of huge news to break today,
[00:32.560 --> 00:34.640]  a loaded deck.
[00:34.640 --> 00:42.160]  But before we get false flagged into a World War III situation over Syria, I think it's
[00:42.160 --> 00:45.400]  important to remember that history repeats itself.
[00:45.400 --> 00:49.720]  And if we don't learn from our history, we're bound to repeat it.
[00:49.720 --> 00:53.680]  John Bowne has an important report on what they're currently trying to do in America
[00:53.680 --> 00:57.600]  to erase American history.
[00:57.600 --> 01:03.040]  America and its Indian wars is dark and bloody, a struggle in the guise of manifest destiny
[01:03.040 --> 01:06.320]  that resulted in the massacre of thousands of innocents.
[01:06.320 --> 01:10.560]  It's a history that Americans need to learn from rather than drop into the dustbin of
[01:10.560 --> 01:16.880]  history because history always sneaks up and repeats itself if preceding generations are
[01:16.880 --> 01:19.080]  unaware of known consequences.
[01:19.080 --> 01:24.440]  But now, after the tearing down of Confederate statues ran like wildfire through towns and
[01:24.440 --> 01:29.360]  universities of the United States, the left have now set their sights on the plight of
[01:29.360 --> 01:30.360]  the Native Americans.
[01:30.360 --> 01:32.560]  The War on Statues has opened up a brand new front.
[01:32.560 --> 01:37.480]  As we told you yesterday, activists in California are targeting a statue of all people, President
[01:37.480 --> 01:38.920]  William McKinley.
[01:38.920 --> 01:41.880]  They claim his policies have harmed Native Americans.
[01:41.880 --> 01:48.600]  So of all the statues to prominent Americans, why does this statue offend the Weot tribe?
[01:48.600 --> 01:53.920]  Though he was never there in Humboldt County, his actions that he did while as president
[01:53.920 --> 01:58.200]  severely affected the Native Americans throughout the United States.
[01:58.200 --> 02:02.680]  So in the 1860s, McKinley, of course, was fighting slavery as a member of the Union
[02:02.680 --> 02:04.960]  Army for three and a half years.
[02:04.960 --> 02:07.400]  That's I think we both agree a virtuous thing.
[02:07.400 --> 02:10.720]  He was president for a term in a very short period.
[02:10.720 --> 02:14.240]  What did he do specifically to hurt the Weot tribe?
[02:14.240 --> 02:20.480]  That's the thing, he doesn't have any significance to the Weot people.
[02:20.480 --> 02:23.400]  But where the statues at is the issue.
[02:23.400 --> 02:30.480]  The statue where he is located in the Arcada Plaza was used as an auctioning block for
[02:30.480 --> 02:35.320]  Native Americans, especially for Native American youth or Weot youth.
[02:35.320 --> 02:38.520]  And yeah, it was more like a human trafficking era.
[02:38.520 --> 02:39.520]  Well, that's awful.
[02:39.520 --> 02:40.840]  I mean, I'm not for that.
[02:40.840 --> 02:44.760]  But that didn't happen, obviously, during the time that he was president, because there
[02:44.760 --> 02:50.160]  was no slavery, of course, by his presidency, partly because of the actions that he took
[02:50.160 --> 02:51.160]  as a Union soldier.
[02:51.160 --> 02:52.160]  I mean, this is so mindless.
[02:52.160 --> 02:53.160]  It's hard to track.
[02:53.160 --> 02:54.160]  I want to take this seriously.
[02:54.160 --> 02:57.320]  I mean, your name, for example, is Madison, Madison-owned slave.
[02:57.320 --> 02:58.320]  Should you change your name?
[02:58.320 --> 03:01.880]  Well, Charlottesville, as you know, is in the only community dealing with controversial
[03:01.880 --> 03:03.520]  historical statues and symbols.
[03:03.520 --> 03:07.640]  There's a town in Northern California that's removing the statue of President William McKinley
[03:07.640 --> 03:09.200]  from its town center.
[03:09.200 --> 03:11.560]  McKinley was also supported by the Ku Klux Klan.
[03:11.560 --> 03:16.640]  And where does the tearing down of statues of U.S. presidents and monuments lead?
[03:16.640 --> 03:19.200]  Of course, it leads to our very founders.
[03:19.200 --> 03:25.280]  George Washington was known by the Iroquois as Kano Takarias, or the destroyer of towns.
[03:25.280 --> 03:28.960]  Or Andrew Jackson's removal act that led to the Trail of Tears.
[03:28.960 --> 03:32.080]  And after that, part of our undeniable history is gone.
[03:32.080 --> 03:34.200]  Will the name America be next?
[03:34.200 --> 03:37.480]  Name's sake, Amerigo Vespucci was a slave holder.
[03:37.480 --> 03:42.560]  And then what, will the Constitution be targeted on the basis that it was created by slave
[03:42.560 --> 03:44.840]  owners and Indian killers?
[03:44.840 --> 03:50.560]  If we scrap these historical figures, aren't we also erasing major victories by the indigenous
[03:50.560 --> 03:56.440]  population, such as Little Big Horn or the Apache Wars, where leaders like Mengus Colorado's
[03:56.440 --> 04:01.480]  Cochise, Victorio, and Geronimo held off the U.S. Army for decades?
[04:01.480 --> 04:04.960]  As an American, our history is fascinating and exhilarating.
[04:04.960 --> 04:11.240]  And after that, part of our undeniable history has been torn down, never to darken the snowflake's
[04:11.240 --> 04:13.240]  timid little doors again.
[04:13.240 --> 04:20.680]  Everybody's face is covered, this is America, this is the country you want to live in, whether
[04:20.680 --> 04:27.520]  you agree with it or not, this is communism, this is what they did pre-World War II.
[04:27.520 --> 04:39.400]  I mean, it doesn't matter if you're black, white, yellow, red, it might be this monument
[04:39.400 --> 04:40.920]  today, but what's tomorrow?
[04:40.920 --> 04:45.520]  When will the rabid dogs of the left stop using our history to distort our future?
[04:45.520 --> 04:48.400]  Why wouldn't we spend our time in tax dollars preserving our respect?
[04:48.400 --> 04:52.560]  So there you go, folks, the four report on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube, and if
[04:52.560 --> 04:57.720]  they can erase the past, if they can erase history, they can erase the future and lie
[04:57.720 --> 05:00.440]  about all of it, and that's what they're doing.
[05:00.440 --> 05:03.680]  Get ready for Alex Jones to invade the swamp.
[05:03.680 --> 05:08.920]  Jones is set to give a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. on April 10,
[05:08.920 --> 05:13.320]  during which he'll make a statement on the raft of anti-free speech lawsuits targeting
[05:13.320 --> 05:15.280]  his First Amendment rights.
[05:15.280 --> 05:19.080]  Numerous lawsuits have been launched on the premise of attracting media attention and
[05:19.080 --> 05:22.600]  defaming Alex Jones and Info Wars' reputation.
[05:22.600 --> 05:27.440]  Jones will address the left's new tactic of trying to bury Info Wars under a deluge of
[05:27.440 --> 05:32.280]  lawsuits, several of which do not rest on any sound legal basis.
[05:32.280 --> 05:36.600]  While the mainstream media and many on the left routinely celebrate these lawsuits when
[05:36.600 --> 05:41.920]  they're first filed, those same people are noticeably silent when the lawsuits collapse.
[05:41.920 --> 05:46.280]  These lawsuits are yet another attempt to shut down free speech, and they are doomed
[05:46.280 --> 05:47.280]  to fail.
[05:47.280 --> 05:52.240]  Alex Jones will go live at 9 a.m. Eastern from the National Press Club in Washington,
[05:52.240 --> 05:53.240]  D.C.
[05:53.240 --> 05:57.440]  You can find live streams of the press conference at InfoWars.com.
[05:57.440 --> 06:26.280]  I'm Leigh-Anne McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[06:26.280 --> 06:36.520]  A day to be thrust into the main chair here at the InfoWars headquarters in Austin, Texas
[06:36.520 --> 06:41.360]  as the news today is about as big as it's been in a while.
[06:41.360 --> 06:49.600]  And that is saying a lot, where you are on the brink of a potential World War III situation
[06:49.600 --> 06:57.480]  over the chemical attacks or the false flag chemical attacks in Syria, as President Trump
[06:57.480 --> 07:03.480]  has just said, he's condemning the heinous attack in Syria, and he'll make a decision
[07:03.480 --> 07:08.080]  on U.S. response in 24 to 48 hours.
[07:08.080 --> 07:16.880]  Now, of course, over the weekend on Twitter, he went off and said animal Assad and was
[07:16.880 --> 07:20.640]  already condemning the attacks and the Assad regime.
[07:20.640 --> 07:27.640]  Russia has responded saying that it is a false flag, that in fact it didn't even happen.
[07:27.640 --> 07:34.800]  And then you have John McCain blaming Trump for the attacks because of his stance, lack
[07:34.800 --> 07:36.600]  of days called stance on Syria.
[07:36.600 --> 07:40.440]  Yeah, for not being an interventionist, you know, for just not going into Syria and starting
[07:40.440 --> 07:44.440]  another foreign war, you know, that's what McCain's into.
[07:44.440 --> 07:50.680]  But there's an irony to that because technically Trump is kind of to blame because it was McCain's
[07:50.680 --> 07:55.320]  rebels that probably staged the false flag attack in response to Trump not going along
[07:55.320 --> 07:57.060]  with regime change.
[07:57.060 --> 07:58.720]  So that's how that actually works.
[07:58.720 --> 08:01.440]  Trump doesn't go along with regime change.
[08:01.440 --> 08:06.660]  So the Syrian rebels that McCain brags about meeting with stage a false flag attack.
[08:06.660 --> 08:13.200]  And then he blames Trump, well, of course, because Trump wouldn't go for the regime change.
[08:13.200 --> 08:14.960]  So you've got all of that going on.
[08:14.960 --> 08:20.280]  And again, Russia saying it is a false flag Trump going fully along with it says 24 to
[08:20.280 --> 08:24.040]  48 hours before we'll find out the U.S. response.
[08:24.040 --> 08:27.840]  And then of course, Israel blamed for the missile strike in Syria that left 14 dead,
[08:27.840 --> 08:32.880]  including some Iranians.
[08:32.880 --> 08:41.840]  And so you've got all that then domestically with Facebook and Twitter and social media,
[08:41.840 --> 08:45.760]  they are in the pit on one side of the aisle.
[08:45.760 --> 08:53.880]  You have Mark Zuckerberg, who's going to have to testify, I believe, for two committees.
[08:53.880 --> 09:01.040]  And this is just crazy because first you've got all of the stuff going on with the censorship.
[09:01.040 --> 09:04.920]  They could be they could be facing fines.
[09:04.920 --> 09:12.400]  Then you've got Zuckerberg hiring people that work for President Bush and others to basically
[09:12.400 --> 09:16.160]  get social tips on how to be normal.
[09:16.160 --> 09:20.320]  This is how you want to present yourself because I mean, the guy is socially awkward.
[09:20.320 --> 09:27.920]  So he's trying to get a course in how to be a normal socially interactive person.
[09:27.920 --> 09:37.960]  Then you've got Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey celebrating a a dem victory in a second civil war talking
[09:37.960 --> 09:43.480]  about civil war in the United States, which is what they want.
[09:43.480 --> 09:47.080]  So we've been telling you they want civil war.
[09:47.080 --> 09:50.960]  That's why they want to come take the guns.
[09:50.960 --> 09:58.720]  I mean, it's honestly just insane that all of this is going on right now.
[09:58.720 --> 10:04.000]  And then meanwhile, Robert Mueller's Russian probe, have you forgotten about this thing?
[10:04.000 --> 10:05.440]  So that's just ongoing.
[10:05.440 --> 10:11.520]  I mean, you know, Russian influencing election total bull all over the weekend, they say cyber
[10:11.520 --> 10:15.480]  security threat Russia, cyber security threat Russia, it's like these buzzwords.
[10:15.480 --> 10:17.640]  It's like that never changed.
[10:17.640 --> 10:19.320]  That was the same during the Obama years.
[10:19.320 --> 10:21.040]  Why are you reporting on it now?
[10:21.040 --> 10:24.960]  Oh, because Trump got in and you can use it for an agenda and a narrative.
[10:24.960 --> 10:25.960]  Got it.
[10:25.960 --> 10:28.800]  The same thing with the quote unquote trade war with China.
[10:28.800 --> 10:32.280]  We have a trade war now, it's a trade war.
[10:32.280 --> 10:37.400]  China's been beating us to a bloody pulp in trade for 20 years, almost 30 years since
[10:37.400 --> 10:38.400]  the 90s.
[10:38.400 --> 10:40.840]  You can look at the charts.
[10:40.840 --> 10:42.240]  And now it's a trade war.
[10:42.240 --> 10:48.040]  So yeah, it used to be it used to be trade rape, but now it's trade war and it's bad
[10:48.040 --> 10:49.040]  and it's Trump's fault.
[10:49.040 --> 10:53.680]  But Trump bad trade war, China trade rape good.
[10:53.680 --> 10:58.960]  And if you don't like that, you're a Russian agent.
[10:58.960 --> 11:01.680]  So you've got all of that going on.
[11:01.680 --> 11:03.920]  And here we are smack dab in the middle of it.
[11:03.920 --> 11:06.120]  But think about this.
[11:06.120 --> 11:09.640]  This is the key.
[11:09.640 --> 11:14.920]  And this is to me what Russia is signaling and what Putin is signaling right now.
[11:14.920 --> 11:22.440]  You're not going to stage another false flag to start a war or install a regime change.
[11:22.440 --> 11:26.000]  You're done.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.400]  And that's right at the McCain's of the world.
[11:28.400 --> 11:32.320]  And if Trump wants to step in line with the McCain's of the world, he's gonna get war
[11:32.320 --> 11:35.880]  with the Russias and the Putin's of the world.
[11:35.880 --> 11:39.600]  And that's how this is gonna go.
[11:39.600 --> 11:43.840]  I mean, what, see, here's the thing.
[11:43.840 --> 11:47.360]  The average individual can see right through this to me.
[11:47.360 --> 11:54.800]  And that's one thing that really bothered about this to me is I see a lot of young conservatives
[11:54.800 --> 12:00.200]  coming up in political media, coming up on the conservative end of things, starting to
[12:00.200 --> 12:01.760]  make a name for themselves.
[12:01.760 --> 12:03.840]  And of course, they're riding the Trump momentum.
[12:03.840 --> 12:07.520]  They're riding the Trump train to get to where they're at.
[12:07.520 --> 12:09.920]  So they're going right along with this whole Syria thing.
[12:09.920 --> 12:14.040]  They're like, oh, thank goodness, Trump will draw a red line.
[12:14.040 --> 12:16.640]  Trump will draw a line in the sand and they won't cross it unlike Obama.
[12:16.640 --> 12:24.600]  And it's like, oh, oh, man, oh, that's exactly what we were trying to avoid.
[12:24.600 --> 12:25.600]  And then here we are.
[12:25.600 --> 12:30.840]  So Trump says 24 to 48 hours before we find out if we're going one step closer to the
[12:30.840 --> 12:38.840]  ledge of World War Three, which I know I have the story somewhere over here.
[12:38.840 --> 12:42.160]  I've got so many stories, I can't even find them.
[12:42.160 --> 12:49.360]  A former Russian general said would probably be the last war of mankind's history.
[12:49.360 --> 12:51.000]  Actually, it's right here.
[12:51.000 --> 12:59.480]  Veteran Putin general Evgeny Buzhinsky says events today could lead to the last war in
[12:59.480 --> 13:00.480]  the history of mankind.
[13:00.480 --> 13:02.240]  In fact, let's go to the clip.
[13:02.240 --> 13:04.480]  Let's just go to the clip right now, guys.
[13:04.480 --> 13:12.080]  In the clip 11, this is a Putin general warning, Evgeny Buzhinsky, that World War Three, that
[13:12.080 --> 13:15.800]  we just got one step closer to, could be the last war of mankind.
[13:15.800 --> 13:21.240]  It's worse than the Cold War because if the situation will develop in the way it is now,
[13:21.240 --> 13:25.760]  I am afraid that it will end up in a very, very bad outcome.
[13:25.760 --> 13:26.920]  Spell us out.
[13:26.920 --> 13:30.520]  What do you mean by a very bad outcome and worse than the Cold War?
[13:30.520 --> 13:31.520]  A real war.
[13:31.520 --> 13:34.240]  Worse than the Cold War is a real war.
[13:34.240 --> 13:37.320]  It will be the last war in the history of the mankind.
[13:37.320 --> 13:43.160]  You are saying that the fallout from the Soviet Union could lead to a real war.
[13:43.160 --> 13:44.160]  How so?
[13:44.160 --> 13:48.840]  Not the Soviet Union's very poisoning, but all the actions, you see, because of the
[13:48.840 --> 13:49.840]  pressure.
[13:49.840 --> 13:53.880]  The United States is saying, you are saying that the pressure will continue.
[13:53.880 --> 13:55.280]  What are you going to achieve?
[13:55.280 --> 13:59.280]  If you are going to achieve the regime change, it's useless.
[13:59.280 --> 14:04.840]  You are cornering Russia, and to corner Russia is a very dangerous thing.
[14:04.840 --> 14:05.840]  So there you go.
[14:05.840 --> 14:11.480]  Yeah, they try to stage a false flag over a poisoning in Salisbury, and they blame Russia.
[14:11.480 --> 14:16.280]  And then they stage a false flag in Syria and blame Syria.
[14:16.280 --> 14:18.800]  But again.
[14:18.800 --> 14:22.680]  And so yeah, World War Three would be the most deadliest war of all time, absolutely.
[14:22.680 --> 14:25.120]  The type of weapons we have.
[14:25.120 --> 14:27.560]  And I think, well, you don't even want to think about this.
[14:27.560 --> 14:30.560]  You don't even want to know.
[14:30.560 --> 14:33.800]  But again, the average individual, if you take a look at what has happened over the
[14:33.800 --> 14:41.840]  last two weeks, okay, Trump looks like regime change in Syria, not on his mind, not on his
[14:41.840 --> 14:42.840]  radar.
[14:42.840 --> 14:46.480]  He'd rather not be involved, even thinks we should be pulled out.
[14:46.480 --> 14:50.680]  John Bolton, all of a sudden, joins his administration.
[14:50.680 --> 14:56.280]  And less than two weeks later, we get a chemical attack in Syria, and now Trump wants regime
[14:56.280 --> 14:59.520]  change all of a sudden against animal Assad.
[14:59.520 --> 15:03.040]  It's funny how that works.
[15:03.040 --> 15:10.400]  So for me, and I feel like for you, we scratch our heads and we say, is Trump really being
[15:10.400 --> 15:11.520]  fooled by this?
[15:11.520 --> 15:15.000]  Is Trump really being fooled by neocons like John Bolton?
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.680]  Is Trump really being fooled by a false flag?
[15:18.680 --> 15:20.860]  Or is he going along with it willingly?
[15:20.860 --> 15:24.040]  Is that the stage that we've reached now?
[15:24.040 --> 15:28.200]  Is Trump now being controlled like a nice neocon warmonger?
[15:28.200 --> 15:36.280]  But I'll tell you what, none of it will matter if we don't have a First Amendment and a Second
[15:36.280 --> 15:37.280]  Amendment.
[15:37.280 --> 15:38.440]  None of it.
[15:38.440 --> 15:43.400]  And so that's why Alex Jones is in Washington, D.C., fighting for the First Amendment.
[15:43.400 --> 15:44.900]  Huge event tomorrow.
[15:44.900 --> 15:46.920]  We'll talk more about that on the other side.
[15:46.920 --> 15:52.800]  Hopefully we can avoid World War III, but this latest development in Syria, folks, is
[15:52.800 --> 15:54.320]  not good.
[15:54.320 --> 15:56.800]  And the President's response is very disheartening.
[15:56.800 --> 15:59.880]  We'll be right back.
[15:59.880 --> 16:00.880]  This is Dan Pilla.
[16:00.880 --> 16:02.440]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[16:02.440 --> 16:04.000]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.800]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[16:06.800 --> 16:09.040]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[16:09.040 --> 16:13.120]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[16:13.120 --> 16:14.120]  case.
[16:14.120 --> 16:17.720]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[16:17.720 --> 16:21.520]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.

[16:51.640 --> 16:58.880]  to more.
[16:58.880 --> 17:00.760]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[17:00.760 --> 17:05.520]  Clawed arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[17:05.520 --> 17:06.520]  by you.
[17:06.520 --> 17:07.740]  But the symptoms are there.
[17:07.740 --> 17:12.720]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, whore circulation and irregular heartbeat
[17:12.720 --> 17:16.060]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[17:16.060 --> 17:20.840]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives

[21:49.160 --> 21:56.360]  security and crew that we need when he goes on the road like this. And some specials running
[21:56.360 --> 22:02.120]  at the store right now include Alpha Power, which is 25% off. It was out of stock for
[22:02.120 --> 22:07.800]  a while. It's back in stock. So take advantage of that. While it's in stock, infowars life
[22:07.800 --> 22:14.880]  select premium is $100 off right now. So that's a big special. And when you have a $50 or
[22:14.880 --> 22:19.840]  more purchase at the store, you get free shipping. So you'll have free shipping with that, which
[22:19.840 --> 22:24.720]  is pretty expensive sometimes with those emergency food supplies because they get kind of heavy.
[22:24.720 --> 22:30.840]  But free shipping with $50 or more on your purchase. Electropure Breeze is still $50 off.
[22:30.840 --> 22:35.520]  Is that even real? That has to be a misprint. So we've got a special. That's the most ridiculous

[22:56.880 --> 23:02.880]  an event like this, get the guests and then do a four hour broadcast in the middle of
[23:02.880 --> 23:09.360]  10 hours of live broadcasting that we now do every day, all made possible by you at
[23:09.360 --> 23:19.800]  infowarsstore.com. So again, the big stories are false flag in Syria, could lead to World
[23:19.800 --> 23:27.280]  War three, depending on the US response. Facebook is, well, Zuckerberg is in trouble
[23:27.280 --> 23:35.920]  as he's about to have to testify. Then you've got the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey going right
[23:35.920 --> 23:42.680]  along with the Democrat narrative of civil war, which would of course only end up bad
[23:42.680 --> 23:52.200]  for their minions, but they don't care about that. And of course, they're being all looked
[23:52.200 --> 23:57.200]  at as well for perhaps whatever they've been getting involved with with data gathering
[23:57.200 --> 24:02.360]  and sharing and private information sharing and, you know, they just brag about it and
[24:02.360 --> 24:10.200]  project Veritas undercover videos. Nothing from the Justice Department, though. I guess
[24:10.200 --> 24:16.760]  James O'Keeffe just doesn't exist to the Justice Department. James O'Keeffe never
[24:16.760 --> 24:23.880]  heard of him undercover video of the Democrat Party plotting violence. What? No, no, no,
[24:23.880 --> 24:29.120]  no, no, no, no, no kid couldn't be not even possible. Not even possible. And then Zuckerberg
[24:29.120 --> 24:37.880]  is so awkward. He's getting coached on how to be social right now. What is this world
[24:37.880 --> 24:46.320]  on living it? And then you get reminded when you see stories like this. Robots replace soldiers
[24:46.320 --> 24:51.920]  and first breaching exercise of its kind. This is on military.com today. U.S. and British
[24:51.920 --> 24:56.880]  troops participated in the robotic complex breach concept demonstration during which
[24:56.880 --> 25:01.160]  several remote controlled vehicles performed a task usually carried out by soldiers. It's
[25:01.160 --> 25:07.440]  a a breach task, obviously a very dangerous one. And now they're about to bring the robots
[25:07.440 --> 25:12.280]  to the field and I'm reading this story and I'm like, yeah, info wars.com had that story
[25:12.280 --> 25:19.040]  a couple years ago. Robots come to the army. Yeah, that was info wars.com about four years
[25:19.040 --> 25:29.400]  ago. Yeah, so next year's news today again. Just where do you go? It's just all all of
[25:29.400 --> 25:35.320]  this is crazy. Oh, here's another example. How about CNN secret direct talks underway
[25:35.320 --> 25:43.440]  between U.S. and North Korea? Oh, yeah, CNN breaking this on Sunday, April 7. No, we broke
[25:43.440 --> 25:49.320]  this again months ago. We told you that they were in back channel, secret conversations
[25:49.320 --> 25:57.120]  and that Trump had already reached a deal with North Korea. That was us, not CNN. And
[25:57.120 --> 26:05.280]  then I got to say, Drudge links to this story, not ours two months ago. So just saying that
[26:05.280 --> 26:12.720]  that's how that goes. But let's get back to what's going on in Syria. Now, of course,
[26:12.720 --> 26:18.920]  here's Lindsey Graham guys, let's queue up clip eight. He is right along with it. Oh,
[26:18.920 --> 26:27.040]  yeah. Lindsey Graham war drums charging into Syria. He urges Trump, we need to keep those
[26:27.040 --> 26:32.600]  troops in Syria. President Trump's taking the gloves off when it comes to fighting ISIS
[26:32.600 --> 26:37.480]  inside of Iraq. He's done the same in Syria, but he wants to somehow leave. All I can tell
[26:37.480 --> 26:43.240]  President Trump, you're building a wall. You know what, just see pause this right here.
[26:43.240 --> 26:48.200]  This is the type of bull crap that we're sick of. They try to leave. What do you mean try
[26:48.200 --> 26:54.280]  to leave? Let's let's hop in the jets. Let's hop in the helicopters. Let's get the hell
[26:54.280 --> 27:02.240]  out like you. Oh, oh, no, no, hey, you can't just do that. That's way too complicated. Well,
[27:02.240 --> 27:09.640]  why is that the case? Because neocon warmongers like you have all your strings tied over there.
[27:09.640 --> 27:17.080]  And then we, the people of America have to look like jackasses for your foreign wars.
[27:17.080 --> 27:23.360]  And then you get Russia ticked off at us. And they're going to want to bomb us because
[27:23.360 --> 27:30.320]  we keep interfering in regime change that we don't belong in. And going along with false
[27:30.320 --> 27:34.800]  flags. And then here comes Lindsey Graham. Make sure to keep those troops in Syria. You
[27:34.800 --> 27:39.880]  can't take them out. It's too complex. It's our business now. We have to stay finished
[27:39.880 --> 27:40.880]  the clip.
[27:40.880 --> 27:44.640]  And you building a wall to protect us from threats from the southern border. There is
[27:44.640 --> 27:49.240]  no wall you can build in the mid east. The only way we can protect America is in the
[27:49.240 --> 27:55.320]  means, you know, again, the only way you can protect America from the mid east. You can't
[27:55.320 --> 28:00.600]  build a wall in the mid east. America is not in the mid east. You think like Lindsey Graham
[28:00.600 --> 28:08.720]  and ABC News think that you are as dumb as a turkey. This is insulting to me. This is
[28:08.720 --> 28:13.640]  what we're sick of. Well, you just can't be removed from Syria. Well, we got to stay protected
[28:13.640 --> 28:20.000]  in the Middle East. We got to be there all the time. Oh my gosh, really? All right, just
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.480]  go back to just let let's let Graham finish her troops working with regional partners
[28:25.480 --> 28:30.320]  to have a virtual wall over there. If you take these troops out of Syria, ISIS comes
[28:30.320 --> 28:37.240]  back. Iran begins to dominate Syria. And that's the end of us being a reliable ally. The Kurds
[28:37.240 --> 28:42.760]  that fought with us are going to get slaughtered in this situation. The entire. Yeah, so we
[28:42.760 --> 28:48.320]  get to have the the Syrian rebels over there. McCain goes and meets with them. They can
[28:48.320 --> 28:52.800]  do whatever they want. They leave behind tons and tons of chemical weapons. Then a false
[28:52.800 --> 28:57.040]  flag happens and it's all serious fault. So let's go back to war. It's a bunch of bull
[28:57.040 --> 29:03.440]  crap, man. We're done with it. Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists, get back to nature.

[32:03.940 --> 32:09.000]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection. Mitochondria produce over
[32:09.000 --> 32:15.560]  95% of your energy. They are your body's cellular engines. Cell Force helps promote your cellular
[32:15.560 --> 32:20.920]  energy production by supporting mitochondria, much like a cellular engine overhaul. Because
[32:20.920 --> 32:26.000]  when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive
[32:26.000 --> 32:32.480]  oxygen species. Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage,
[32:32.480 --> 32:38.360]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species. The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some
[32:38.360 --> 32:43.160]  of the most powerful available on the market. The stronger the antioxidant, the better its

[33:04.040 --> 33:33.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. We're going to
[33:33.800 --> 33:40.400]  hear from Alex in this segment in just a moment. You know, it's amazing, as I was sitting
[33:40.400 --> 33:46.600]  here in the break, I was thinking about the story, how CNN reports now, we reported on
[33:46.600 --> 33:51.160]  it months ago, secret direct talks underway between US and North Korea. Sorry, CNN, we
[33:51.160 --> 33:56.000]  scooped you every time. But I'm sitting here and I'm thinking, okay, so essentially we're
[33:56.000 --> 34:01.800]  going to have to entente with North Korea now. Well, why not Syria? Why are there no
[34:01.800 --> 34:08.080]  meetings with Assad and Trump? Isn't Kim Jong-un much worse? Oh no, that's why they
[34:08.080 --> 34:17.480]  have to frame Assad and his regime for chemical attacks. Make him the boogeyman. But no detente
[34:17.480 --> 34:27.280]  for Assad and Syria. Yes, for North Korea. I'm just trying to figure it all out here.
[34:27.280 --> 34:32.520]  Doesn't make sense to me. None of it makes sense to me. I think a lot of Americans are
[34:32.520 --> 34:41.400]  scratching their heads over this. And when you have Russia, and look at how it pits
[34:41.400 --> 34:48.560]  Russia perfectly into a corner, just as the general from Russia was saying earlier, look
[34:48.560 --> 35:00.520]  how it puts Russia in a corner when you stage false flags and then use that to give reason
[35:00.520 --> 35:12.080]  why you want to have a regime change, including saying that Russia is poisoning its own spies.
[35:12.080 --> 35:17.960]  What is Russia supposed to do? Just take it, say, okay, fine, the US, just do whatever
[35:17.960 --> 35:24.960]  you want, just lie about us, lie about Syria, take out our ally, fine. No, and that's why
[35:24.960 --> 35:28.500]  the Russian general says, look, these events could lead to World War III, which we the
[35:28.500 --> 35:41.040]  last war in mankind. That's what Einstein said. That's what anyone with a brain understands.
[35:41.040 --> 35:47.760]  I don't know what weapons they'll fight in World War III with, but I know in World War
[35:47.760 --> 35:56.960]  IV, they'll be using sticks and stones. And so that's where we're at right now. Now,
[35:56.960 --> 36:01.560]  hopefully you don't get to that point, but there actually is something very essential
[36:01.560 --> 36:10.160]  you can do for yourself to protect yourself from potential nuclear fallout or other things.
[36:10.160 --> 36:15.760]  And it's just incredible that you would even have to think about that, but you do. Let's
[36:15.760 --> 36:20.840]  now go to Alex Jones, who has very important information for you here on the Alex Jones
[36:20.840 --> 36:25.000]  show. One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research and
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.080]  talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy. Iodine is in every
[36:30.080 --> 36:35.080]  cell of your body. The iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain
[36:35.080 --> 36:41.240]  damage and loss of IQ in the world. In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine. Iodine
[36:41.240 --> 36:47.760]  used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer. Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers
[36:47.760 --> 36:55.600]  switched to bromide instead. Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less
[36:55.600 --> 37:00.640]  now than it was then. Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.080]  with iodine. And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine in the
[37:05.080 --> 37:10.800]  last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it. But none
[37:10.800 --> 37:18.480]  of them are as pure or as clean as the original. SurvivalShieldX2.com. I was just about to
[37:18.480 --> 37:23.400]  walk out of the studio to pick my children up, and I got some bad news. For the second
[37:23.400 --> 37:28.880]  time in the five and a half year history of SurvivalShieldX2, our flagship product, we
[37:28.880 --> 37:33.960]  are having supply chain problems. And this may be the last batch of this. You see, we
[37:33.960 --> 37:41.040]  have to go through the DEA to get this because it is pure atomic iodine. Everything else
[37:41.040 --> 37:47.440]  out there is bound, or it's contaminated, it's not absorbable, it's toxic. We have deep
[37:47.440 --> 37:53.120]  earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere.
[37:53.120 --> 37:59.080]  And it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process. And
[37:59.080 --> 38:04.600]  so in our own search to get the purest form, we discovered that oil companies and gas drilling
[38:04.600 --> 38:09.240]  companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies, and also drug
[38:09.240 --> 38:13.800]  makers that they used to make drugs. That's why the FDA is involved, and that's why the
[38:13.800 --> 38:18.560]  DEA is involved. So it's a major industrial product being used, and that we could actually
[38:18.560 --> 38:23.280]  bring it to the public, pure. But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas
[38:23.280 --> 38:27.840]  companies to do it. And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the
[38:27.840 --> 38:33.200]  price. So we have a run of this, a limited run. We have a good supply right now. We're
[38:33.200 --> 38:39.240]  talking maybe two months of it. But this may be the clincher. We may not have X2 in this
[38:39.240 --> 38:45.360]  configuration in the future. But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out. Hopefully,
[38:45.360 --> 38:49.120]  the last time this happened a few years ago, it's not an issue, and we do get more. But
[38:49.120 --> 38:54.600]  right now, we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own
[38:54.600 --> 39:00.920]  research and the test in the world. SurvivalShieldX2 at m4store.com and m4slife.com. You've got
[39:00.920 --> 39:04.640]  to experience what having the good halogen in your body does. Most folks for about three
[39:04.640 --> 39:10.560]  weeks go through a detoxification process. But what it does is for stamina, libido, focus,
[39:10.560 --> 39:14.560]  energy is really amazing. Because just like vitamin C, which is readily available everywhere
[39:14.560 --> 39:19.000]  in a green leafy vegetable or fruits like oranges, this is not available. And if you
[39:19.000 --> 39:24.200]  don't have true iodine, pure iodine, you will end up having all sorts of disorders.
[39:24.200 --> 39:29.520]  You will die just like water, just like oxygen without iodine. It is an essential element.
[39:29.520 --> 39:36.520]  You will die. It's available exclusively. SurvivalShieldX2 and m4slife.com and m4store.com. And I hope
[39:36.520 --> 39:41.400]  like a few years ago that we can work this out. It's just right now we're kind of over
[39:41.400 --> 39:45.680]  a barrel. So I want listeners and viewers, everybody to know this stuff has a very, very
[39:45.680 --> 39:50.800]  long shelf life. I personally have stockpiled it and your purchase is funding operation,
[39:50.800 --> 39:55.640]  fighting for free speech, the Second Amendment national sovereignty. So it is a true 360
[39:55.640 --> 40:01.480]  win. Again, the term I coined or what they said before, a non-zero sum game. This could
[40:01.480 --> 40:07.000]  potentially be the end of SurvivalShieldX2 as we know it. If you love the original like
[40:07.000 --> 40:12.600]  I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for limited time at m4store.com.
[40:12.600 --> 40:21.400]  And of course, iodine is something you would ever need should there be nuclear fallout
[40:21.400 --> 40:29.240]  or a potential war of that nature. And I'm telling you, America has been very, very
[40:29.240 --> 40:36.600]  fortunate and there's reason for it why we usually don't get hit when these international
[40:36.600 --> 40:41.840]  wars are going on. But I think if we go forward with this folks, I really think Russia would
[40:41.840 --> 40:45.720]  probably launch a missile on us. I hate to say that. Honestly, I hate to say it. It's
[40:45.720 --> 40:52.240]  just that's what my gut tells me. They're done. No more false flags. No more fake wars.
[40:52.240 --> 40:58.000]  You're done. You're done. And that's, see, and that was what we were supposed to do.
[40:58.000 --> 41:04.600]  That's why we elected Trump because we said we're done too. And now here we are. Right
[41:04.600 --> 41:12.080]  smack dab in the middle of it again. And I realized something. Remember the big story
[41:12.080 --> 41:19.240]  last week where Russia was calling for a meeting with Trump. They're saying Putin and Trump
[41:19.240 --> 41:23.240]  need to meet. This has to happen. What are you waiting for? You're meeting with everybody
[41:23.240 --> 41:28.320]  else. You need to meet with Putin. Now this is desperate. And Trump responded saying, yeah,
[41:28.320 --> 41:35.320]  we can get along. I think we need to meet. Well, the reason they wanted to meet is because
[41:35.320 --> 41:42.640]  they already got tipped off on this false flag coming. They knew this false flag was
[41:42.640 --> 41:49.640]  coming. The white helmets were in on the planning. And who knows where they got these chemical
[41:49.640 --> 41:53.520]  weapons? Let's not forget about the story as well, where the Syrian rebels backed by
[41:53.520 --> 42:02.400]  McCain and Obama left behind 30 tons of chemical weapons. Oh, but forget that. No, no, no, no.
[42:02.400 --> 42:08.080]  You didn't hear that. So now you see Putin wanted to meet with Trump last week because
[42:08.080 --> 42:15.320]  he knew they were about to stage the chemical weapons false flag this week, blame Assad,
[42:15.320 --> 42:19.480]  and then put Russia in a corner. And so Putin wanted to get out ahead of that and meet with
[42:19.480 --> 42:30.240]  Trump, and it didn't happen. And now he rears that. And everybody, at least I feel like
[42:30.240 --> 42:35.320]  reasonable, logical Trump supporters, ones that don't go along with anything he says
[42:35.320 --> 42:41.480]  and don't want to warmonger, but want to sit there and be real, say, what is going on?
[42:41.480 --> 42:45.880]  Why is he saying we have less than 48 hours to decide what our response in Syria is? Why
[42:45.880 --> 42:50.200]  are we going along with more false flag attacks in Syria? I thought we were done with this.
[42:50.200 --> 42:53.880]  I thought we were pulling out of Syria. But then here comes John Bolton. Here comes the
[42:53.880 --> 42:59.520]  chemical weapons attack. And here comes another foreign war.
[42:59.520 --> 43:03.520]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen. And I make it really easy. We went
[43:03.520 --> 43:07.880]  out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy
[43:07.880 --> 43:13.720]  stamina, mental clarity, you name it. And we created a stronger formula than some of
[43:13.720 --> 43:16.800]  the best selling formulas out there. It's very simple. We went out and looked at what
[43:16.800 --> 43:20.360]  is the top? What is the best? We'll just put even more product in. We'll make it better.
[43:20.360 --> 43:25.680]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60. We put $10 in it and sell
[43:25.680 --> 43:31.520]  it for $30. It's $19.95 right now. So you get an incredible top of the line new tropic
[43:31.520 --> 43:37.880]  for $19.95. Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average. We need that $15, $20 we make
[43:37.880 --> 43:41.880]  to fund this operation in the face of the global threat of it. But I'm doing this because
[43:41.880 --> 43:46.000]  we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks. I want to shell it all out before the big
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.800]  supply comes in. And I want people that haven't tried brain force to try it and find out why
[43:50.800 --> 43:56.160]  it's got 6,000 plus five star reviews. It's amazing info wars store dot com info wars

[47:29.920 --> 47:36.760]  com. Well I came across an interesting find the other day when I saw an old 1930s trolley
[47:36.760 --> 47:42.400]  that was from Pennsylvania. Now inside this trolley there were tons of advertisements
[47:42.400 --> 47:49.000]  and one advertisement really stood out. It was that of iodent toothpaste, the iodine
[47:49.000 --> 47:57.040]  containing toothpaste. It said all dentists know the value of iodine therefore iodent
[47:57.040 --> 48:04.080]  toothpaste. Wow that's the first time I had ever heard of an iodine containing toothpaste
[48:04.080 --> 48:11.160]  other than info wars super blue iodine containing toothpaste. So I wanted to know what happened.
[48:11.160 --> 48:24.000]  Where did this iodine toothpaste go? It was during the 1930s that the American Dental
[48:24.000 --> 48:30.720]  Association began purging many of the dozens that's right you heard me dozens of iodine
[48:30.720 --> 48:36.960]  containing toothpaste products from their recommendation list. In fact in the 1920s the
[48:36.960 --> 48:42.640]  American Dental Association approved iodent and it was the only toothpaste that the American
[48:42.640 --> 48:48.680]  Dental Association approved and recommended. So what happened? When did they start replacing
[48:48.680 --> 48:53.760]  iodine containing toothpaste with fluoride containing toothpaste? Well to understand
[48:53.760 --> 48:58.960]  this we have to understand the age of fluoride that's right the discovery and implementation
[48:58.960 --> 49:05.160]  and use of fluoride both in America and as well as Germany. Show the benefits of fluoridation
[49:05.160 --> 49:12.200]  will last throughout life. It wasn't until 1931 in the United States that fluoride was
[49:12.200 --> 49:17.440]  recognized to have an effect on cavities inside the teeth. Well how did this discovery
[49:17.440 --> 49:23.120]  get made? Well it was because a Colorado Springs town had an epidemic of fluorosis essentially
[49:23.120 --> 49:28.800]  brown spotting on their teeth and dentists could not discover what was causing it. Turns
[49:28.800 --> 49:34.440]  out there was fluoride in the water supply naturally occurring and that caused a massive
[49:34.440 --> 49:40.920]  problem of fluorosis. They then also discovered that the fluorosis of the teeth actually strengthened
[49:40.920 --> 49:47.680]  the tooth enamel and made it so that the teeth were less likely to decay. In 1944 the city
[49:47.680 --> 49:55.360]  of Grand Rapids, Michigan used this study this information to justify adding fluoride
[49:55.360 --> 50:00.960]  to its water supply which then we all know that many other cities and states would later
[50:00.960 --> 50:08.040]  follow suit. German doctors were already using fluoride to treat hyperthyroidism in Germany.
[50:08.040 --> 50:12.800]  It's also interesting to note that the Nazis used fluoride and produced it by the ton.
[50:12.800 --> 50:18.360]  During World War II IG Farben created tons and tons of fluoride as insecticides to use
[50:18.360 --> 50:23.920]  on their crops. They also created this fluoride to make medicines one of which was for Bayer's
[50:23.920 --> 50:29.360]  Pardinon a chemical that was used to treat hyperthyroidism. However they would later
[50:29.360 --> 50:35.360]  discover the impact of fluoride on the thyroid would blow out the thyroid entirely and that's
[50:35.360 --> 50:41.600]  why we no longer use fluoride to treat hyperthyroidism today. So within the time period of World
[50:41.600 --> 50:48.200]  War II the Nazis were known to have put fluoride in the drinking water at concentration camps.
[50:48.200 --> 50:53.080]  Now why did they do this? Did they put the fluoride in the water so that they would essentially
[50:53.080 --> 51:00.480]  give them hypothyroidism, essentially remove their willpower to make them tired and fatigued
[51:00.480 --> 51:05.840]  with low energy, poor concentration and keep them alive longer to do their slave labor?
[51:05.840 --> 51:11.440]  It's also important to note that today in the drug Prozac is fluoride. So essentially
[51:11.440 --> 51:19.320]  you're giving a population of mass drugging to sedate them. So it's between 1931 and 1939
[51:19.320 --> 51:25.240]  that we saw this massive purge of iodine-containing toothpaste products as well as mouth washes
[51:25.240 --> 51:30.440]  with the argument that these companies could not substantiate the therapeutic claims they
[51:30.440 --> 51:35.880]  were making in regards to iodine setting the precedents that toothpaste companies were
[51:35.880 --> 51:42.200]  only allowed to promote and talk about their effect on the consumer's teeth and nothing
[51:42.200 --> 51:49.720]  else. 1939 iodine toothpaste was purged from the American Dental Association's list of
[51:49.720 --> 51:56.840]  recommended remedies for reasons such as claiming therapeutic effects belonging to iodine,
[51:56.840 --> 52:02.120]  which then opened up the door for the insertion of fluoride into our toothpaste because they
[52:02.120 --> 52:06.680]  were only going to look at and acknowledge the effects that fluoride had on teeth and
[52:06.680 --> 52:10.800]  they could ignore any of the health effects that fluoride might have on the rest of the
[52:10.800 --> 52:15.880]  human body. During the 30s time period, it's been known that there were goiter epidemics
[52:15.880 --> 52:20.300]  which were linked to iodine deficiency. So it would have made sense that they would put
[52:20.300 --> 52:24.960]  iodine in their toothpaste products. We've seen studies where excessive amounts of fluoride
[52:24.960 --> 52:31.520]  could actually lead to goiter problems. Upon treating goiter with iodine in the west, communities
[52:31.520 --> 52:38.120]  saw substantial increases in children being born with higher IQs. Studies have shown that
[52:38.120 --> 52:44.000]  pregnant women who are iodine deficient have children with lower IQs and inversely pregnant
[52:44.000 --> 52:50.960]  women that have iodine in their system have children with higher IQs. Now CNN even acknowledged
[52:50.960 --> 52:57.340]  recently a study that linked lower IQs to pregnant women's consumption of fluoride.
[52:57.340 --> 53:05.000]  So are we seeing a purposeful negative impact on American health and IQ or can we chalk
[53:05.000 --> 53:13.640]  it up to mere coincidence and conspiracy theories? Do you realize that fluoridation is the most
[53:13.640 --> 53:21.360]  monstrously conceived and dangerous communist plot we have ever had to face? Go to infowarstore.com
[53:21.360 --> 53:30.400]  to get your super blue iodine containing toothpaste today. Info warstore.com. You know, it's amazing
[53:30.400 --> 53:39.440]  what you can do for your own health. And then you do it for some time and it becomes habitual
[53:39.440 --> 53:48.960]  and you can see the changes in your life. And it's something simple as nascent iodine
[53:48.960 --> 53:53.480]  where you can get your pineal gland firing up again, fight against the poisonous fluoride
[53:53.480 --> 54:00.800]  in the water. It's just a simple thing. It's just a simple thing. And it changes your life.
[54:00.800 --> 54:09.160]  And it's so simple yet people just don't even do it. But even the average human, because
[54:09.160 --> 54:16.080]  they still have gut instincts, barely they're clinging to life right now, know that the
[54:16.080 --> 54:21.440]  environment is poisoned. I mean, anybody you can say, hey, you know, our food and water
[54:21.440 --> 54:24.160]  have got some, you know, some chemicals and stuff in it running off. They're probably
[54:24.160 --> 54:29.360]  like, yeah, of course, you know, of course it is. Like if you deny that, you might as
[54:29.360 --> 54:38.600]  well deny that water even exists. So that's why Millie highlights that science where it's
[54:38.600 --> 54:44.440]  just incredible. Yeah, we already knew the power of nascent iodine. We already knew the
[54:44.440 --> 54:47.800]  negative effects of fluoride. Why did they put the fluoride in the water and then remove
[54:47.800 --> 55:02.640]  the iodine from the toothpaste from the salt? Why? And you know, the human that has a soul
[55:02.640 --> 55:10.040]  left, the human that has a spirit left asks why and then tries to find out why and then
[55:10.040 --> 55:18.640]  goes into the rabbit hole and ends up at info wars.com. Yeah. That's pretty much the circle
[55:18.640 --> 55:27.600]  of how that goes. Now, again, the big story is false flag in Syria. Russia saying no more
[55:27.600 --> 55:32.960]  putting us on the brink of World War three. Trump says he will decide the US response
[55:32.960 --> 55:41.040]  in 48 hours. That's the big story to me. Then you've got domestically, the big story has
[55:41.040 --> 55:46.840]  to be what's going on with social media, Twitter, Facebook already under scrutiny. Now Zuckerberg
[55:46.840 --> 55:51.520]  is going to have to testify. And then you have the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey basically
[55:51.520 --> 55:57.240]  going along with the Democrat narrative of civil war, because of course the Trump supporters
[55:57.240 --> 56:04.520]  are the Nazis. So I'm going to open up the phone lines in the next hour. I'm also going
[56:04.520 --> 56:19.320]  to cover the ridiculous notion of now knife control, knife control in London, knife control.
[56:19.320 --> 56:29.960]  So I mean, where does this end? If I go out and I report on people beating people with
[56:29.960 --> 56:38.840]  baseball bats, then does Sadiq Khan call for baseball bat control? I mean, that's the logic,
[56:38.840 --> 56:47.680]  right? How many car accidents are there a year? You know, it's sad. There was a really,
[56:47.680 --> 56:53.480]  a really special individual, an info warrior who recently died in a motorcycle accident.
[56:53.480 --> 56:58.320]  Do we need motorcycle control? Should we now stop people from riding around in motorcycles
[56:58.320 --> 57:06.040]  because they're more dangerous? Well, they're calling for knife control in London. So we'll
[57:06.040 --> 57:10.920]  cover that in the next hour. We're going to get into the most, I don't know if you would
[57:10.920 --> 57:17.200]  call it irony or inside job, but this whole Facebook testimony and the narrative that's
[57:17.200 --> 57:21.280]  being spun about it. Well, we're going to expose that whole thing on the other side
[57:21.280 --> 57:25.800]  as well. And I'm going to open up the phone lines in the next hour. So that's the plan
[57:25.800 --> 57:32.200]  for the next hour. This is the Alex Jones show. Alex Jones is in Washington, DC, getting
[57:32.200 --> 57:39.440]  set for his press club address tomorrow. It'll be streamed at info wars.com slash show bound
[57:39.440 --> 57:43.040]  to be epic. They're trying to take away our First Amendment right, folks. And why do you
[57:43.040 --> 57:51.840]  think that is? It's because we're next year's news today. Info wars life, brain force plus
[57:51.840 --> 57:56.240]  is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds. And for a good reason, going back
[57:56.240 --> 58:00.160]  about five years ago, we did research on what top selling new tropics were, what were most
[58:00.160 --> 58:04.880]  popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger. Then we cut
[58:04.880 --> 58:10.680]  the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup. We only have 150
[58:10.680 --> 58:16.600]  percent. Then it helps fund our operation. Well, now it's 50% off. That means we've got
[58:16.600 --> 58:23.720]  a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days
[58:23.720 --> 58:28.440]  to kick in brain force takes about 30 minutes. But the two go together. It's the mind and
[58:28.440 --> 58:36.520]  body challenge. They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping
[58:36.520 --> 58:41.720]  with the combo at infohorselife.com. But it's got to end in a couple of days because both
[58:41.720 --> 58:46.680]  of these best sellers are about to sell out infohorselife.com to get your brain force

[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:14.680]  Broadcasting live from the UN stronghold Austin, Texas. You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:28.280]  and now your host, Owen Troyer. So I'm about to cover this video the anti knife or the knife control
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:36.760]  video that Sadiq Khan shared and I'm just sitting here first of all okay yeah all right we all
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:46.920]  understand the ridiculousness of this notion even though we almost ingest predicted it you know like
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:50.840]  oh you know gun control then they'll want knife control and then they'll want you know baseball
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:55.880]  back control whatever no that's actually what they do that's actually where it's going and I'm sitting
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:01.640]  here and I'm thinking about this I'm like okay we're gonna play this video but what you know what
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:08.120]  is what is and then it hit me it dawned on me pull pull that clip back up of Sadiq Khan that you
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:12.360]  the picture you guys just had up there it that's kind of perfectly what I was going to talk about
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:20.600]  look how does some pathetic weasel chump like that become the mayor of London
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:32.760]  you know I mean I'm serious are people that pathetic that they elect some twerp weasel
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:40.040]  punk like Sadiq Khan and then he gets reelected even this guy's a puke see this is the problem
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:48.440]  we have a bunch of beta male sissy punks running government like this clown
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:54.040]  and you know why because alpha males don't want to run government because alpha males don't want
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:59.640]  to run for office you know why because they don't like running other people's lives they like independent
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.000]  they like being independent being sovereign
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:10.360]  and if they should lead people voluntarily then that's the way it goes
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:16.280]  but they don't like begging for your support begging for your election deciding your policy
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:25.640]  look at this knit so it doesn't surprise me that some punk you know what some little twerp
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:33.560]  becomes the mayor I guess that's what happens in a country of beta males they elect the most beta
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:40.760]  of them all and then he says terrorism is part and parcel in my city but we need knife control
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:48.040]  so here is the knife control ad from london
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:03:00.120]  look at the people I make the sweetie I'm the energy the color the force the voice

[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:50.040]  for remembering info or store.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake but
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:54.040]  it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word again thank you so
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:06:10.120]  much for being part of the second american revolution you found it the tip of the spear it is the
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:26.680]  alex joneshow with holland shawyer you know as we're sitting here today thinking about the future
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:35.960]  of this country figuring out what's going on with syria and the trump administration and what they're
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:41.880]  going to do next figuring out what we need to do about the social media empires censoring free
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:51.720]  speech calling for civil war zuckerberg set to testify it's just amazing to me because so much
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:07:01.480]  of the news or not excluding myself but so much of the news really just creates a divide in the
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:08.920]  country and of course when people deny truth and reality that's just going to happen i mean i'm not
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:13.720]  going to stop being honest i'm not going to stop being truthful just because someone can't handle
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:19.960]  the truth that's not how we operate here that's why we are the tip of the spear that's why we are
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:29.160]  the leading edge but i'm in st louis over the weekend in my hometown and when i'm when i go on
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:35.000]  when i go out of town or i'm on vacation i it's easier for me to just take the mental break
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.960]  and go into the arrested development and go to a ballgame and go to a bar of friends and not
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:49.000]  be so deep into everything i need i i mean i i have to step away or i go crazy but as i step away
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:08:01.240]  every time i realize how yes we're divided but but more than anything because the general
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:07.480]  because the general public because the general population is so unaware and is so uninformed
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:14.680]  they really aren't divided they really just don't care and so again it's it's all about
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:24.520]  about somehow reaching that body of people and i think just being true to yourself coming on here
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:32.120]  being real going with the truth going with your gut you know praying to god for clarity
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:37.880]  is the best way to go about that because if you try to shove something down their throats
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:42.600]  they're just going to turn away and turn their head and be sour on it but here's what here's
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:50.920]  what's happening see organically and naturally as info wars gets bigger as alex jones videos get
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:57.720]  bigger as as owen shroyer videos get bigger and they see that was the biggest thing that i had
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:02.760]  people saying to me is we don't even really necessarily care about your politics or agree with
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:11.480]  it but you expose the dirty nastiness of the the left and so it's like i am staying as far away
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:16.120]  from that as possible and so that's what the key is going to be moving forward
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:27.720]  and so that's why i say you just have to continue to be true continue to report what you believe
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:34.360]  to be the case and not try to pander or cater which of course is what the mainstream news does all
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:42.200]  day long to some agenda or some narrative or something that you're not even yourself behind but
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:52.600]  you just do it because that's your job cnn msnbc and it's just amazing so i i do believe there's
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:59.000]  hope but the question is do we get enough people awake to fight in the info war to fight in the
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:05.240]  spiritual battle or will it be too late or is it already too late as we're on the brink of world war
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:10.440]  three and of course these are all the questions on the other side the next segment here's what
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:15.960]  we're going to do we're going to talk about zuckerberg's testimony coming up here and how
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:26.200]  there's a media spin about it that is absolutely untruthful absolutely provable as a lie and it's
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:31.560]  actually pro you know what how is that even in fact i don't even know how it's legal what
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:35.720]  i don't even know how what we're going to expose on the next side is even legal
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:42.040]  i don't know how it couldn't be legal in fact so we'll discuss that on the other side but
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:47.880]  essentially the people that are going to be grilling zuckerberg are essentially his clients
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:57.240]  yeah three wolves and a sheep voting for for what's for dinner you know how that's
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:02.200]  going to go that's essentially what zuckerberg's testimony is right now but we're going to get
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:06.120]  into the numbers and the details of that on the other side i want to give out the phone number now
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:19.000]  though 1877789 alex 18777892539 now my biggest question and i like to kind of let's let's keep
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:26.680]  the callers on track today guys on two questions what do they think is going to happen with syria
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:30.120]  what do they think trump is thinking what do you what do you think trump is going to do
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:37.880]  so so you can either call in on one of these two subjects what do you think is happening in syria
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.920]  what do you think trump's going to do what do you think he's thinking what do you think russia
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:47.560]  is going to do what do you think they're thinking or what do you think happens to
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:57.800]  facebook or zuckerberg given he's about to have to give at least two testimonies to a committee
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:03.240]  and they're going to grill him not all of them but there will be select individuals that might
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:08.600]  actually give him a hard time we'll see and if that's the case if they ask zuckerberg the right
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:18.120]  questions do you realize how screwed he is oh my gosh we're talking about years of data gathering
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:25.560]  data mining data sales that most of the american population is going to be like what i didn't agree
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:32.200]  i didn't agree to that oh but you did didn't you boy you did you clicked that i agree to the terms
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:40.200]  and conditions didn't you boy oh but then do you have another precedent now are you looking at
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:50.600]  another legal precedent is that even considered justifiable clause to say well they said they
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.320]  agreed to our terms and conditions that said that we now own their soul yes they didn't
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:00.920]  read it but we they signed it and clicked it so they clicked i accept and checked the box we now own
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:09.480]  your soul i mean so is that legal i mean can you do that maybe that's a precedent that needs to be
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:20.200]  looked into now because to me that's zuckerberg's only defense but don't worry because the liberals
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:28.120]  have most of these judges bought off anyway so zuckerberg will be fine now if trump uses
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:34.600]  camber jane lidica and facebook to get data then he's bad trump administration bad facebook bad
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:43.720]  if obama does it obama genius facebook genius they save the world nobel peace prize that's how
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:49.720]  that goes that's just lovely all right so those are the two subjects for your calls on the other
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:54.920]  side what do you think is going on with syria in syria what do you think trump is going to do
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:14:00.680]  what do you think russia is going to do and or what do you think happens with mark zuckerberg
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:08.120]  and his testimony coming up to mark zuckerberg and or to facebook does anything happen does
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:14.120]  does nothing happen or are are we looking at potential new legal precedents the likes of
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:23.880]  which we've never seen because this case is so vast and is so or i mean it's it's really the
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:30.680]  first of its kind to my knowledge when you talk about a big social media empire data gathering
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:36.840]  mining and selling it and then having to have to testify on it and then you had some uh ceo that
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.840]  was like this is what all CEOs have to do so he's about to find out whether or not he's going to
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:46.200]  make it so those are the two subjects in the meantime ladies and gentlemen we've got alex

[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:27.400]  there's developing news right now on the syrian front where trump says he's going to make a decision
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:32.680]  on the us response in less than 48 hours you already had a missile strike in syria israel
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:39.720]  blamed for that so this is already popping off and now there are potential reports coming through
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:45.960]  the pipeline that there might already be people troops on the way so we're going to monitor that
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:52.120]  situation and see what the story is with that now in this segment though we're going to focus on
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:00.680]  the facebook mark zuckerberg testimony that's coming in front of two senate committees and one
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:06.680]  of the producers crew members here matt i was talking to before the show and he was like hey
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:13.640]  look at this media spin that they're trying to report zuckerberg is really in the crosshairs
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:18.680]  over these committees they could really grill him and so matt goes and looks at the members
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:22.840]  and looks at the committees and says hey wait a second really would they be grilling him because
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:28.360]  they're in his pocket deep and it's really incredible you did the research you found some of these
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:34.120]  not just committees but also members of congress that are making buku dollars from facebook yeah
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:40.520]  that's right owen um so one of the things that i read on dredge this morning um it's a a p set of
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:49.080]  axios and uh it's titled meet the lawmakers who could give zuckerberg hell and um i i want to take
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:54.440]  a look back at an article that was published last week by usa today and the key takeaway from it is
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:22:02.680]  that 44 out of the 55 members that will be grilling mark zuckerberg over the next two days
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:07.720]  have received contributions from him and those numbers are actually pretty substantial
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:17.000]  um where these two stories meet is in exactly where axios says um these folks are really going
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.520]  to give him a good grilling so we can break down some of the numbers here and actually
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:27.880]  if anyone else wants to go do their own independent research you can go to opensecrets.org it's
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:34.760]  actually linked um as the center for representative politics or responsive politics if you will
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:38.440]  in the usa today article there we go we've got it on screen for everybody if you go to
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:43.240]  info wars.com forward slash show you can see exactly what we're talking about
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:49.320]  and you can see look at those donations now in the 2018 cycle alone you'll see that democrats
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:55.720]  have eclipsed the republicans i mean four hundred and thirty thousand dollars in donations compared
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:01.960]  to 184 thousand dollars okay that's still serious money on the table you're looking at uh
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:08.680]  uh it's more money than the russians spent that's a great point that's a great russians
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:13.480]  didn't spend that much money and so i'd like to delve into this axios article just to see how
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:18.840]  full of uh crap they are so but think about this too before you get into these numbers that axios
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:26.920]  would either be so willingly able to spin this or that they just wouldn't even do the research
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:30.600]  they say oh we're just going to find the guys here and we're going to say they're going to question
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:33.800]  them hard and then and then you're just like well wait i'm going to do basic research and
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:36.600]  i'm going to find out that actually they're probably not going to question them hard because
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:41.480]  they're all in the pocket well yeah there's that i think that what this is going to amount to is
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:47.800]  facebook making the case that they provide a tangible service you know by linking people together
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:56.520]  and that value to users outweighs the costs of them you know for fitting their privacy
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:01.400]  you know so um and you know everyone does it it becomes you know a really common practice for
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:07.160]  people too like you said in the last segment just hit i accept yeah who reads the you know 30 pages
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:11.320]  terms of service every time you get an update nobody reads that yeah it's i mean it's it's
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:17.080]  absolutely ridiculous and you know what honestly if legislators from these hearings if they decided
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:22.520]  hey we need to make the terms of service for these things uh more outlined more basic that
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:26.600]  would be great but i know that's a legal precedent and that's that's the thing too that we'll ask the
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:31.320]  college is you know that's a potential legal precedent that we see coming down on the social
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.800]  media side and just in general media you know anytime it's the terms of service you know if
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:40.040]  you download the latest adobe or you know whatever it is you have to agree to the terms of service
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:43.640]  nobody's reading that so you've got that potential legal precedent then you've got this where it's
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:49.160]  like hey look isn't it a conflict of interest it's almost like they should recuse themselves
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:54.280]  from being a part of this hearings when you're in the pocket of the guy you're you're questioning
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:25:01.320]  absolutely so so get into some of these numbers oh yeah okay so um let's start here um at the
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:09.400]  three g.o.p committee chairman okay um chuck grassley he is known as a a really outstanding
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:15.160]  ethical guy i like chuck grassley he's a great guy um if you take a look back in the 2016 election
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:21.000]  cycle he received four thousand dollars however i don't think facebook sees him as politically viable
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:27.480]  or perhaps they see him as an opponent so actually they haven't donated anything in 2018 so um you
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:35.240]  got that you've got um john thune uh who looks like has received uh money in both the 2016 and
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:41.960]  2018 election cycles he's received seven thousand dollars um and then lastly greg walden um has
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:49.400]  received in total uh throughout the years 27 thousand dollars ladies and gentlemen 27 thousand
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:55.560]  dollars that's like two or three cars yeah very very significant and again how many house
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:00.840]  payments is that i'm not even trying to sit here and and judge these contributions or these these
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:06.200]  politicians i'm just saying they're the ones questioning facebook why would you expect them
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:09.640]  to give a fair questioning if they're in the pocket and those were just the g.o.p members you
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:15.560]  haven't gotten in the democrat oh yeah um we got diane feinstein um she's received ten thousand
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:22.600]  four hundred and thirty five dollars since 2014 uh lindsay graham uh kind of odd right here um in
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:28.200]  2014 he received thirty five hundred dollars however it's not listed as him receiving donations in
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:37.320]  either the 2016 or 2018 election cycles um and then uh here's a here's a crazy number uh in total
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:44.360]  the senate judiciary committee um total committee donations amount to two hundred and thirty five

[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:13.800]  i'm not even here to report on these contributions or complain about that that's its own thing i'm
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:19.560]  saying if these are the people questioning mark zuckerberg how can we expect a fair testimony
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:24.600]  if they're involved potentially in what he's supposed to be there answering questions too

[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:33.800]  tough on zuckerberg they're coming for him and then you find out zuckerberg's been lining their
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:38.760]  pockets for the last five years well maybe they're not gonna be so tough on them maybe they should

[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:18.280]  really should not be involved with in syria it's just it's just not good it's not what we wanted
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:22.920]  it's the last thing we wanted we thought that putting trump in we wouldn't get that anymore
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:32.840]  and now trump is saying in less than 48 hours he is going he is going to make his decision on the
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:38.040]  us response but it looks like a decision may have already been made as the report is up at info
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:44.280]  wars dot com from paul joseph watson us and uk readying attack ships and fighter jets off the
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:52.120]  coast of syria now this just went up this just went live right now at info wars dot com
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:01.640]  so there you go and of course this is all in response to the chemical weapons attack or the
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:05.560]  the alleged chemical weapons attack again russia comes out and says no there's no
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:12.280]  even evidence of a chemical weapons attack and then there is the graphic showing um
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:21.720]  what's going on with the so that's the russian air force so you've got all the activity basically
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:29.320]  going on jets flying around ships going in false flag i mean this is oh oh my gosh oh
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:43.880]  this is so bad this is the worst yet and i i just you know i guess we'll just go to your calls
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:52.120]  because i mean what do you what do you i mean just common sense and logic what happened to it
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:57.560]  donald trump says we're pulling out of syria it's time to come out things are going better there
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:06.200]  there a sod i mean let's be real a sod when he actually has control without the us meddling
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:12.600]  other meddling funding these proxy wars funding the rebels as soon as you get rid of that
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:20.280]  Assad stabilizes the region Assad stabilizes syria whatever you think about Assad it's stable
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:25.480]  when he's in control and you don't have a bunch of people funding proxy wars and rebels like john
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:36.680]  mccain oh but we don't want that do we i guess not and so then the the region stabilizes
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:48.840]  trump says let's pull out we pull out isis is on retreat the syrian rebels are on retreat
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:57.880]  syria stabilizing russian troops go in they find 30 tons of chemical weapons left by the us backed
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:06.840]  rebels and then what happens bolton gets put in the administration false flag chemical
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:15.160]  weapons attack happens in syria and now all of a sudden we're going in just like that and you have
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:22.840]  to ask yourself is trump falling for this is trump going along with this i don't see any 60
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:32.520]  chess moves in this deal unless you want world war three it's just unbelievable and
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:42.200]  see when you realize how real this is when you understand how real false flags are how real
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:49.480]  regime changes how real us interferences that's when you realize how dire the situation is in
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:56.920]  general that's when you realize how the world really works but until you face that music until
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:03.640]  you face that reality it doesn't sink in it just becomes another news story it just becomes more
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:09.560]  middle east tension well it's a little more complicated than that so now the stories on
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:15.720]  info wars dot com us uk ships and fighter jets off the coast of syria russian air force off the
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:22.520]  coast of syria and lebanon and i'm telling you i you know i don't want to say this but this is
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:27.720]  why info wars exist if we go through with this and we try this regime change in syria and we move
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:33.400]  in i think russia will bomb us and i hate to say that but i'm dead serious i think they would
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:40.200]  and that's going to start world war three and here we thought north korea was the big problem
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:50.200]  oh i mean it's just so ridiculous uh you know but but we get to taunt with north korea and kim
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:58.440]  jung-hoon but not with Assad in syria Assad stabilizes syria Assad you could easily have
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:05.880]  to taunt with kim jung-hoon you know crazy dictator how could you have to taunt with him
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:12.280]  somehow we get to taunt with him not with Assad so the questions of the day as we go to the phone
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:16.040]  lines what is going to happen in syria what do you think trump's doing what do you think rush
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:21.720]  is going to do and or what comes of zuckerberg's testimony in front of the senate committees
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:29.480]  let's go out to the callers now let's start with carlos calling in from canada go ahead carlos thank
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:37.320]  you very much owen um no just to rewind the clock to 2013 if you remember president obama was set
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:43.240]  up with a red line that he couldn't cross because syria was going to use chemical weapons against
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:50.760]  its people and of course as predictable as the neocons are they arranged for a chemical attack
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:57.960]  later on it was shown to have been uh not uh sad and even more recently they have
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:05.320]  discovered weapons from israel and from united states on isis camps so um effectively at that
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:11.160]  time president obama was faced with a situation where he mobilized troops and forces to the you
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:18.600]  know to the to the sea by um you know latakia russia a military base in in syria and also
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:23.320]  don't forget john mccain took secret trips over there he bragged about him meeting with the rebels
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:30.120]  correct and you know uh that has to be seen in perspective because at that time president obama
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:37.400]  was being led down the road of effectively a confrontation um this is the same situation
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:42.280]  it's the same players the same repeat uh you know false flag well that's the thing though but see
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:46.200]  that's the thing carlos we didn't think it was the same players because we thought we had trump
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:51.400]  in there that was the thing changed the game by putting in a different player now we get the
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:58.280]  same game the same outcome correct and that just gives you a progress report on the swamp okay
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:08.440]  the precisely if if president uh trump falls to the false flag uh doesn't uh establish his
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:15.320]  leadership over the neocons on this stage of the game he will be betrayed uh in november by the
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:20.520]  republic insect guaranteed McCain and others and he will not have the power that he had
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:25.240]  when he became president to do what he promised to make america great again no that that is that
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:29.640]  is exactly it carlos that is exactly it this is a progress report on the swamp we've done our
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:34.280]  progress reports on trump that's all fine and good this is a progress report on the swamp
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:40.200]  they're still calling the shots and if trump doesn't stand up to the neocon republicans who
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:46.600]  betrayed him time and time again and stabbed him in the back then why did he say he's gonna return
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:50.920]  the government to the people why did he tell us we're taking washington dc back when washington
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:56.680]  dc is still running dc for interest in the middle east no that's not what we voted for

[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:29.720]  deluge of lawsuits several of which do not rest on any sound legal basis while the mainstream
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:34.680]  media and many on the left routinely celebrate these lawsuits when they're first filed those
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:40.440]  same people are noticeably silent when the lawsuits collapse these lawsuits are yet another attempt

[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.920]  back out to the phone lines now let's go to preston calling in from missouri go ahead preston
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:48.680]  hey on how's it going buddy can you hear me got you loud and clear all right well carlo pretty
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:54.760]  much hit it right on the head um that a lot of points i was trying to make but it's important for
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:48:01.960]  us and the info warriors to understand the context of the history of this whole syrian civil war
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:10.520]  we helped start it obama gave it gave his famous red line speech what was it i think if memory
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:15.800]  serves a year to the day after he made that speech we had the first chemical weapons attack
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:24.120]  that turned out to be chlorine homemade chlorine gas not state-made uh sarin gas so and the videos
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:29.960]  of isis actually firing it got got discovered they're like bragging about it they're firing it in
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:35.080]  they're bragging about it and the media's like a sod gas is his own people as they're like loading
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:41.960]  the loading the the bombs like and it's like what right and then the un i think did their own
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:46.680]  investigation and found that it was the rebels that did it but the mainstream media just kept
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:52.040]  going with the the parodying effect of a sod killing his own people a sod killing his own people
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:58.680]  and then you had um all of the people in the military post on twitter you know hashtag no war
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:05.320]  in syria i didn't sign up for the navy to fight for al-qaeda and the syrian civil war and then i
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:09.960]  think i was reported a bunch a bunch of generals went to obama and said look man if you go to war
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:14.120]  in syria you're gonna have mutiny on your hand and that's what made them back off we have to do
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:20.360]  the same thing to trump if trump goes through with this i am off the trump train it's that simple
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:25.720]  um i cannot i did not vote for trump for more regime regime change i voted for trump to make
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:31.800]  america great again to drain the swamp and right now the swamp is draining trump it seemed you said
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:38.040]  earlier you don't see any 60 chest i don't see any 60 chest either there is no good that can come
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:44.120]  from regime change in syria and the sod whether you like him or hate him he hasn't gassed his own
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:50.040]  people that we have any credible proof for and as you mentioned he is a stabilizing force in syria
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:57.160]  without that all the middle east goes up and flying and so um and so do and so do any potential
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:02.360]  positive relationships with the united states and russia exactly we could take down the global
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:08.120]  system in the new world order if we were able to be allies or at least uh not enemies with russia if
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:12.280]  we were able to work with trying to infuse these other places we could stabilize the point we could
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:16.760]  use this crazy technology that's going to be coming but we already have a lot of it but in the next
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:22.440]  10 20 years we could use that technology to empower humanity but the military industrial complex
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:28.760]  is obviously hard at work trying to prevent that from happening so i just was calling carlos hit all
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:36.280]  my points on the head i've heard him before he's very informed um guest or or caller uh i will be
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:42.680]  off the trump train if he does something um in syria i just cannot support that and i think his
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:47.960]  base just looking at twitter and facebook nobody's falling for this everybody from the minute it
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:52.440]  happens we're like wow this sounds like a false flag all week before we're trumps telling the
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:57.160]  pentagon prepare to remove our troops from syria we don't need to be in there we're going to bring
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:01.880]  our troops home and have a parade and you know make america great again and guard our borders
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:06.520]  with the troops for uh you know to stop illegal immigration all of a sudden this happens
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:13.640]  and now nobody's talking about how kim jong-un says that he is up for negotiating the nuclearization
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:18.120]  yeah amazing how that happens and how you can have detente with kim jong-un but not a sod
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:24.280]  yeah it's crazy kim jong-un has killed way more of his own people he's way more of a ruthless
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:30.440]  yeah you want to talk about gassing people how about starving them to death yeah yeah absolutely
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:35.560]  if they didn't cry long enough when your daddy died then you you know and and where's a sod
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:41.320]  making threats against the united states to nuke us you know i mean but we can't have detente with him
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:47.720]  exactly no but i think i i do i do believe that a lot of people i mean myself included
[01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:54.600]  in all the stuff behind trump he never lost my vote in 2020 if he starts a war in syria or we
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:59.640]  get world war three because of a false flag again like you said that now i'm questioning trump 2020
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:04.200]  i don't know how he gets my vote of course you're gonna have blind sheep behind any politician you've
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:08.040]  got plenty of blind sheep that'll follow trump wherever he goes but most trump supporters
[01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:13.800]  are critical thinkers are independent minded and will not go along with this and i agree
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:18.200]  right now it does not look like they are hey good to hear from you preston i'm sure we'll
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:23.640]  talk sometime soon let's go to uncle sam calling in from louisiana also wants to comment on the
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:30.920]  serious situation go ahead uncle sam hello oh and of course i want to start out by thanking you for
[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:36.920]  the recognition uh they've came with the price though i do believe i was death threaded by the
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:44.120]  state police um yeah we saw the video uh yeah you sent me the video they were intimidating you out
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:51.000]  there yeah yeah well how dare you well now hold on how dare you be on the streets of new orleans a
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:57.080]  beautiful american city dressed as uncle sam talking about patriotism and supporting this country i mean
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:07.640]  how dare you yeah yeah but and my site is my name it's michael and d barry d i capital b a r i can
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:14.520]  use the support go by there you go check out my videos there was a video that was also taken down
[01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:20.920]  i'd like to send to you somehow but i don't want to send it over the usual uh ways because i put
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:28.680]  it up it it was a video of a reporter from a very prominent uh washington dc newspaper i will not
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:37.320]  name right now and um they got it very candid with me 100 probably more so than they should have
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:42.600]  and they took that video every once in a while their arrogance ends up biting them in the butt
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:47.480]  that's why project veritas has been so successful but uncle sam what do you think is the situation
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:53.880]  right now with trump russia and syria i wish i had some answers for you all and all's i can do is
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:59.080]  echo exactly what you're saying with a past caller saying and the past caller before that
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:08.120]  but the trump's supposed to be the smart one i mean most of us smell a rat immediately you know
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:13.720]  again here we are talking about jail we're pulling out and then you could almost do the countdown to
[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:19.400]  the false flag and and we just are critical thinkers who don't have a memory like a goldfish we don't
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:26.920]  want history to repeat itself and that's what we're seeing happening now yeah yeah and as far as the uh
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:33.880]  on the uh facebook thing what i'm of course the meetings that he's having right now i'm looking
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:39.480]  at bright part uh headlines and they're talking about zuckerberg going around meeting with capital
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:47.240]  hills well but the only time you meet with people before a test of uh testifying is to make a deal
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:54.280]  or to get your story straight eat exactly exactly and then what i plan to do this uh this week on
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:58.920]  the streets because we have a french quarter festival so there's going to be like that'll be
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:05.560]  last oh god this i mean was it i mean this is going to be wall wall people with a french quarter
[01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:12.520]  so what i'm going to do is is have a diamond silk video running and be asking people i love it should
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:18.600]  be censored yeah yeah oh yeah oh you'll see so so even though facebook is in the mist of all of this
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:23.400]  the negative press with the censorship the negative press with the data collection and and sales and
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:30.440]  everything and zuckerberg oh oh they're still going to censor they're still going to be anti free
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:35.720]  speech they're still going to politically censor people and now diamond and silk have been deemed i
[01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:40.840]  forget the exact term it's either inappropriate or a danger to the community diamond and silk
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:47.240]  i mean oh yeah see again what why are you uncle sam a danger to that a community and have to be
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:50.680]  intimidated by the new orange police force you're a danger to the community because you're a free
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:55.960]  thinking american that supports this country and wants to live in america why are diamond and silk
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:56:00.120]  considered a threat and unsafe to the community because they're pro america because they're pro
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:06.440]  trump you see you can't have that message out there you can't have a strong independent black
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:11.480]  woman who thinks for herself and might have policies that go along with trump politically
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:18.280]  you can't have that that's unsafe for the community that we're trying to make we're trying to engineer
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:24.200]  a community see we're social engineers at facebook and we're engineering you socially and culturally

[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:33.160]  and reach logical conclusions by yourself if you had exposure to diamond and silk and uncle sam
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:38.040]  in the streets of new orleans but we're social engineers at facebook we make you think things

[01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:05.320]  to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex-president to endorse the
[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:12.680]  resistance all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia
[01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:19.320]  and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports bully and terrorize
[01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:26.680]  the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness
[01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:33.160]  and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the only way we stop this the
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:40.440]  only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched

[02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:14.120]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex joneshow and now your host
[02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:19.400]  owin shroyer i got something so here's where we're at
[02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:28.520]  trump signals he wants to pull out of syria not be involved with you know whatever's going on there
[02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:34.600]  in their country then bolton gets into the trump administration and now all of a sudden you have a
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:41.800]  chemical weapons attack a false flag in syria that they blame on Assad so that they can have an excuse
[02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:48.680]  for going in there and forcing a regime change and then trump calls Assad an animal and says
[02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:55.080]  we're going to respond in 24 or 48 hours and now reports are surfacing of this perhaps already
[02:06:55.080 --> 02:07:02.760]  happening with us ships and jets arriving off the coast of syria great and so then russia says
[02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:11.720]  it's a false flag these events could lead to the greatest war of mankind
[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:18.840]  and we're just sitting here thinking what is going on is trump being fooled by this i mean does he
[02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:23.640]  actually believe the intelligence that he's receiving or is he going along with it because
[02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:32.440]  i got the story right here from earlier today from the associated press to hell with it
[02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:37.880]  trump increasingly weary of staff advice so here's trump basically saying okay and this isn't the first
[02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:42.760]  time they used to report this like oh my gosh trump horrible he's not listening to the people who are
[02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:46.920]  telling him what to think and say he's like i don't need to hear the same thing eight times a day
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:51.000]  and he's basically saying the same thing again except now he's even more critical of the advice
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:56.200]  he's getting well trump let me tell you something who's ever giving you advice to get involved in
[02:07:56.200 --> 02:08:04.280]  syria and a regime change there you need to be very very weary of that so those are the topics
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:11.400]  we're discussing here on the alex jones show today as well uh as the fate of facebook and mark
[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:17.160]  zuckerberg with those testimonies coming up and then of course you've got twitter ceo basically
[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:24.440]  going with the democrat narrative calling for civil war in america but let's go out to the phone lines
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:35.000]  again let's go to kai in organ go ahead kai hey kai uh you want to try that again
[02:08:39.080 --> 02:08:46.600]  okay hear me all right okay there you go go ahead sorry oh so i just wanted to talk about how the
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:55.720]  rebels in syria who purportedly uh didn't commit this chemical attack actually stands the benefit
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:09:01.480]  from being attacked by this or being victims of this chemical attack well yeah okay so so
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:05.880]  so just pause right there for a second because let's give a little context here you've got
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:17.640]  not us backed rebels destabilizing syria starting starting wars and so then let's say that in response
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:22.920]  to that the syrian government or the syrian army decides we're gonna we're gonna respond we're gonna
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:27.560]  do something about these people that are destabilizing as our country then they're the bad guy so it's
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:33.640]  like no no no no we're just allowed to start wars in your country send in weapons and and fund these
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:38.600]  rebels and then if you respond you're the bad guy we're coming in to take you out it's like
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:45.640]  but but yes they stand to benefit because then they get sent back in and they get more money
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:49.480]  from the united states government but of course russia saying the chemical weapons attack didn't
[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:59.320]  even happen that's interesting well i also just wanted to mention that uh reported that or reported
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:06.440]  Assad's uh military what had the rebels surrounded at the point at which Assad
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:11.560]  committed the chemical attack reportedly committed the chemical attack against his own people
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:19.240]  which wouldn't make any sense considering that if he had the rebels surrounded he would have stood
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:27.720]  to be yeah you know you notice how they don't really give any reason or motive they just say
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:34.280]  Assad chemically attacks his own people what wait a second what happened to like a basic
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:40.760]  line of critical thinking okay why does Assad just hate his own people does Assad just
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:45.880]  is he just some crazy warmonger why is Assad gassing his own people like they say and so they
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:50.920]  don't even ask they don't even say why would Assad gas his own people is he some evil dictators he
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:57.320]  just hate everybody so they don't even ask that you say oh yes bomb him take him out yep yep yep
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:05.080]  intelligence community says so fox news says cnn says msnbc says so i'm going along with it
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:12.120]  i'm not asking why i'm not asking how i'm not asking for any motives i'm saying yes i agree because i
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:21.320]  am a robot i am a brainwashed programmable human droid android that just goes along with what i see
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:27.880]  on television you tell me Assad gassed his own people i say yes i don't say why i don't say how
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:35.000]  i don't ask for any motive i just go along with it because i love war yeah i want more war chi
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:41.800]  you think i'll get another war political power they need their they need their hit
[02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:46.680]  they they're they're just they're basically those neocons are basically just chunkies looking for
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:51.880]  that and russia's done with it and russia's done with it and that's what people in this country
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:57.880]  don't understand there's too stupid and and and they even think about how dumb they are they even
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:12:03.880]  build russia up as the bogeyman they even try to make russia our enemy then you're actually
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:09.640]  in a situation of a potential larger war with russia and they just don't even say anything
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:15.720]  they're just like oh we'll just roll into syria and kick a sod out no problem there and russia's
[02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:21.400]  like uh no big problem there actually actually huge problem huge problem war that couldn't
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:26.840]  man kind type of problem oh but syria chemically attacked his own people just because just for
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:32.200]  the hell of it just just because he wanted to yeah that's actually an interesting point you bring
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:38.280]  up that the media is completely ignoring the repercussions of the regime change in syria
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:45.720]  yeah russia russia hacks our elections russia's the big enemy but but we want to have a regime change
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:52.600]  in syria russia's ally and then nobody talks about russia yeah exactly it it's completely
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:13:02.200]  backwards and it just doesn't make any sense at all and that's yeah exactly on to a chemical attack
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:07.000]  that happened halfway around the world is absolutely ridiculous when it's going to take more than a year
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:11.560]  for us to get any details on the shooting that happened in las vegas which only killed like
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:18.680]  27 people and exactly localized and only was committed with a gun and that's how you know
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:24.520]  exactly all they are always an agenda and the agenda always wins the agenda in the vegas
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:30.840]  massacre was to hide the truth the agenda in syria is to remove a sod from power facts evidence
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:37.640]  common sense don't matter they just don't matter anymore but they do matter and that's why we're
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:44.360]  here and that's why we've said enough you know what you want to go around and have some george
[02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:51.320]  soros leftist funded march okay against school shootings and say enough enough enough how
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:58.840]  about enough of foreign wars how about that you got any problem with us sending masses of weapons
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:03.480]  into the middle east you say you don't want guns here but we just send them all over the planet
[02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:12.440]  you have no problem and that's cool enough enough enough gun attacks enough knife attacks in
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:19.080]  london it's enough think about the children oh but oh you know false flags in syria send weapons to
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:26.360]  rebels over there yeah oh well that's fine good actually good we're the good guys and i'll tell
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:31.880]  you something else thank you for the call kai you know what whatever happened in syria or whatever
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:37.160]  happens in syria here's what i'm here's what i'm saying it's none of my damn business okay so how
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:42.120]  about we get the hell out of that hellhole why don't we get our troops out of that hellhole and
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:46.360]  bring them home and put them on the border where there's a real national security threat
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:57.320]  but that's not the agenda so you don't get that and that's why we voted for trump because we thought
[02:14:57.320 --> 02:15:03.640]  that would become the agenda we thought america first would be the agenda now who's first who
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:10.680]  benefits from removing aside from power not america that that that kills us that sends us
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:19.400]  into another war that makes russia our enemy and where's the news nowhere to be found huge cyber
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:25.880]  threat problem big cyber security threat russia it's like this huge story think about it nothing
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:32.840]  has changed as far as a quote unquote cyber security threat from russia in 10 years except the media
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:39.640]  coverage and except the president why is that because there's an agenda you see all you have to do
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:46.680]  is look at things with common sense logic and reality compare two things and say how come things
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:51.880]  have changed because it's all about an agenda the agenda isn't to protect america's border the

[02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:24.200]  go back out to the phone lines let's go to john in kansas city again the main topic is what do you
[02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:30.280]  think is going on in syria and what do you think trump's response will be go ahead john hey oh and
[02:23:30.280 --> 02:23:38.280]  thanks for taking my call you're welcome you're right on cool hey i'm i'm afraid they might have
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:43.800]  demonstrated to trump it as they be in the globalist that they might have demonstrated they can get to
[02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:48.440]  him anytime they want i mean you got to look at stuff that's been happening lately you got trump
[02:23:48.440 --> 02:23:56.920]  tower catching on fire twice and i heard his personal uh uh aircraft police had a few helicopters
[02:23:56.920 --> 02:24:03.480]  crash and then you got melania had engine failure on aircraft had to make an emergency landing
[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:08.840]  and you got all these military aircraft falling out of the sky don't forget about the white powder
[02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:15.800]  that was sent to don don juniors family no i forgot about that there you go there's another one
[02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:23.240]  no this is a good point this is a great point i you know i mean all these um aircraft falling
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:27.640]  out of the sky everywhere and that's clear get your air quotes out training accident
[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:33.720]  and then you got the navy shipped out there running into one another and uh all this stuff
[02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:40.200]  is happening and and i'm afraid that if he costs them too bad uh you know that he you know he had
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:45.960]  to sign that omnibus bill so he could get the military on his side maybe doesn't have the military
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:51.640]  maybe when the shtf maybe those airplanes will all get hacked and quit working if you know you
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:56.600]  know that you did a great job john calling in and just laying everything out for us to see on the
[02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:01.880]  wall because so many times it gets lost in translation a lot of the stuff you just reported
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:06.440]  and you just have again you have to scratch your head wonder because nothing really makes sense of
[02:25:06.440 --> 02:25:12.440]  this then you know you you can't really make sense of any of it and here and this is my thing i mean
[02:25:12.440 --> 02:25:18.280]  look if if trumps family is being threatened which of course they're being threatened i mean of course
[02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:25.080]  trumps family is being threatened but if it's reached a point now where he's feeling essentially
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:30.840]  held hostage or or handicapped as a president because of these threats well then i say come out
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:37.080]  and talk about it i mean you know if this is really going on this is like national security issue
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:41.160]  number one oh yeah the president's family is being threatened if he doesn't start world war three
[02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:50.440]  you know looks like to me now i know trumps not stupid he was interviewed right after 9 11
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:55.240]  before the smoke cleared out there saying that uh that there had to have been explosives in there
[02:25:55.240 --> 02:25:58.760]  yeah he talks about it being a demolition he's totally a nine line he questions the whole thing
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:05.640]  he questions vaccines but but again where is that guy where is that guy where is the president who
[02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:11.640]  said he's giving power back to us and taking away from dc where now dc is starting wars in foreign
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:18.440]  countries again well if he does pull the trigger on this stuff he's going to have to get his family
[02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:26.440]  to safety for starters and there's you know no telling what's going to happen i guess you know
[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:31.080]  if you can't even trust the secret service too then what are you going to do he's not using them
[02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:39.480]  and can i make a quick comment about sessions okay go ahead i'm afraid he's liable to not do
[02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:44.040]  very much because i don't think he wants an airplane to blow up he hasn't done anything really much of
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:53.560]  all anyway well he's it you know he don't want his airplane to blow up not yet you know john
[02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:57.480]  so so john is pretty much thanks for the call john in candid city john is pretty much under the
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:02.840]  impression now or at least you know weighing the considering the potential that yeah these guys
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:07.560]  are being threatened and blackmailed and pretty much held hostage so they can't even implement their
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:14.520]  policy to which i say then get out i mean you know then just get out then if you're not going to do
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:21.240]  your job get out leave resign quit or i guess that's not an option either because you need the controlled
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:28.840]  people in there so that they don't do whatever it is they might do let's go to marcos quickly in
[02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:36.600]  fort worth texas before we break go ahead marcos um i just want to say that the last caller beat me
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:41.720]  to the punch about the whole threatening thing i just figured i figured trump knows exactly what's
[02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:45.800]  going on but he's been being threatened and he's probably trying to maybe go maybe go in there
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:49.240]  maybe go in there acting like he's about to do something about the chemical weapons but really
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:55.000]  go root out the problem with Putin in a effort to you know i'm saying stabilize stabilize the
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  situation and figure out what's really going on that's me being optimistic however if he goes in
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:04.200]  there starts world war three i'm off the trump train as well yeah it seems to be that that's
[02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:08.120]  most of the case of course you've got the blind sheep that'll get behind any politician oh yeah
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:14.360]  trump siria bad trump good as soon as he you know talks about new kingdom or whatever but
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:22.360]  but you know i agree i don't think trump is dumb i think trump knows exactly what's going on so that's
[02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:27.000]  when the question becomes why and and and and some people are saying well they think that
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:31.880]  perhaps he's being threatened or blackmailed or what have you others are saying the deep
[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:40.360]  states in charge now trumps trumps now answering to the deep state i don't know either way you slice
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:46.600]  it it's not good and the brawler that we put in there is not showing himself right now maybe there's
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:51.720]  some underlying plan with putin to actually do something about this but i just don't see enough
[02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:58.760]  evidence to report that fully cooked ready to eat bacon i'm talking thick meaty center cut

[02:33:30.920 --> 02:33:33.080]  all right developing story
[02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:44.040]  mark zuckerberg has arrived in dc getting ready for his testimonies in front of senate committees
[02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:51.000]  when it comes to the data mining and selling of information that facebook engaged him here is
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:56.360]  the b-roll if you're a television viewer at info wars dot com slash show or one of our affiliates
[02:33:56.360 --> 02:34:04.920]  here is arriving in dc now what do you notice about this the liberal anti-gun platform of
[02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:12.120]  facebook's leader mark zuckerberg arrives in dc with what a full team of armed guards
[02:34:14.440 --> 02:34:21.960]  so zuckerberg says you don't need a gun for protection a gun is dangerous but i need a full
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:28.840]  team of armed guards when i arrive in dc because i'm mark zuckerberg and i am obviously much more
[02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:34.680]  important than you the common citizen because this isn't america where every citizen is equal
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:41.800]  in the republic no this is america where mark zuckerberg is royalty he's the king facebook
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:48.200]  says you don't need a gun but we need a gun because see we're the king kiss my ring and
[02:34:48.200 --> 02:34:52.600]  we'll protect you from the bad guys with the gun even though they have no interest in that
[02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:58.920]  they only have interest in protecting their own interest and themselves and so zuckerberg uses his
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:07.720]  platform facebook to go along with the democrat party plan admitted by eric holder and others
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:15.000]  to brainwash americans into into not liking guns disliking guns rejecting the tradition
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:21.160]  and culture of guns in america brainwash you into giving away your second amendment right
[02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:29.320]  brainwashing you into going from a king to a peasant that's what this is about the king gets
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:35.000]  the gun the peasant gets the boot to the face and zuckerberg goes along with that with the democrat
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:46.040]  party but then arrives in dc with a full team of armed guards so that's hypocrisy at its finest
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:54.920]  then of course at info wars dot com kit daniels has the story flashback facebook pursues total
[02:35:54.920 --> 02:36:05.720]  information awareness of world population which of course is is what darpa's surveillance plan was
[02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:17.960]  now you understand why facebook must be saved and zuckerberg must take the fall
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:27.480]  fall because if facebook falls with zuckerberg then the censorship media control plan with the
[02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:35.080]  total intelligence gathering of the digital grid on the world's population then that fails and they
[02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:42.600]  cannot let that fail zuckerberg we can let him fail he's a prop he's a puppet he made 30 billion
[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:53.960]  dollars no he didn't and so now zuckerberg says i'm sorry it was my mistake because zuckerberg
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:37:02.280]  is going to hop ship and take his fake wealth to the next island and just disappear because facebook
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:07.560]  has to survive zuckerberg is expendable he was a puppet he was an implant from the beginning
[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:16.680]  so so move along zuckerberg move along facebook has to stay facebook's bigger than the government
[02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:21.560]  facebook is a social engineering platform facebook is being used to censor free speech
[02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:26.040]  facebook is being used to demonize the second amendment and gun supporters and activists
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:36.280]  and enthusiasts we need facebook to continue our agenda we don't need zuckerberg in fact facebook
[02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:43.080]  will look better if we kick zuckerberg to the curb how does it feel zuckerberg how does it feel
[02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:50.360]  so you'll take the fall zuckerberg will fall on the sword and facebook will live on
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:38:04.120]  in the meantime we are going to use facebook to go through with the democrat party platform
[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:10.200]  and their brainwashing propaganda to get people to hate guns hate gun supporters
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:16.840]  admitted by eric holder and others you saw the look in diane feinstein's face literally channels
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:26.440]  the wicked witch of the west and like cackles and is like we're gonna get those guns and then they
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:32.360]  just fly around the country with armed security that's how that's how the average democrat operates
[02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:42.120]  you the citizen you're a you're a punk you're a peasant you don't get a gun what do you think you are
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:51.720]  you're a peon you're a you're a cretin you can't have a gun that's for the royalty like zuckerberg
[02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:57.560]  and feinstein and pelosi they get a team of armed security their royalty you the american
[02:38:57.560 --> 02:39:04.920]  citizen are a peasant and a punk and priorace is nazi too while we're at it so you don't get a gun
[02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:12.120]  you're a danger and this is the democrat party platform of propaganda and they don't hide it
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:19.160]  they tell you there's yeah look at her i mean i mean well you know it's amazing
[02:39:19.160 --> 02:39:28.120]  the more i live through this and the more you see stuff like that where diane feinstein
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:35.240]  i mean folks you've never seen a more wicked looking woman and it's i mean look at that
[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:40.120]  this is about taking the guns look at how thrilled she is oh my gosh you can't even believe it
[02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:46.680]  oh my god my dreams coming true of the royalty taking the weapons from the american peasants
[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:53.000]  the democrat propaganda finally worked after my 40 years in congress i'm diane feinstein
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:40:02.680]  and we're finally gonna take the guns we're gonna get your guns you little pretties
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:12.520]  and your and your silencers too oh oh oh oh yeah and don't worry when the twitter CEO jack dorsi
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:17.960]  supports the other democrat propaganda to start a civil war in this country oh don't worry so so
[02:40:17.960 --> 02:40:23.880]  they want listen to the average liberal they support the democrat plan to brainwash america
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:28.840]  into thinking differently about guns they go along with it they turn in the guns they're anti-gun
[02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:34.280]  then they want to start a civil war in which they'll have no guns with the people that have all the
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:41.080]  guns giving all the guns to president trump who they think is hitler and the cops who they think
[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:45.720]  are racist and want to kill all black people so they want to give the guns to hitler give the guns
[02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:54.920]  to the racist police and then tell you well this is to protect us there is no logic but the average
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:41:01.320]  liberal is so stupid now that they look at zuckerberg they look at feinstein who walk around with
[02:41:01.320 --> 02:41:08.360]  armed security guns everywhere protecting them and then say you can't have a gun but they support that
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:17.080]  and so zuckerberg arrives in dc there he is full arm security team full arm security detail think
[02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:27.800]  about this oh my gosh oh my gosh it just hit me why do you think mark zuckerberg needs an armed
[02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:36.440]  security team do you think that's because the average citizen has any will of violence against
[02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:41.000]  zuckerberg do you think the average american is going to be trying to plot to do something to
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:46.440]  zuckerberg no no they're not in fact zuckerberg used to just run around with people and his t-shirt
[02:41:46.440 --> 02:41:50.760]  and short shorts just go running miles it was like a thing he did it was a social thing yeah he had
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:59.160]  security but it wasn't like it there's no threat but zuckerberg is about to testify about his actions
[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:07.240]  as the ceo of facebook oh think about what he knows about the democrat party who do you think is
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:12.120]  the real threat to mark zuckerberg do you think it's american citizen or do you think it's the deep
[02:42:12.120 --> 02:42:18.600]  state that knows he has information that could bring them down think about that you want to talk
[02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:24.840]  about a twist of fate there's your twist of fate right there mark zuckerberg needs armed security
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:31.880]  from the very forces that put him where he is because he has the intelligence and now he's
[02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:38.520]  about to go testify oh yeah people involved with the clintons that are about to testify or go into
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:44.680]  a courtroom magically disappear all the time but i'm sure that's not what could be going on here
[02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:51.160]  as zuckerberg needing protection no no no he's just royalty and you're a peasant he gets armed

[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:40.680]  look at this little juicy from cnn they tweet out their story david hog one of marjorie stoneman
[02:47:40.680 --> 02:47:45.960]  douglas high school's most visible student activist will postpone his first year of college
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:54.680]  to devote time to political causes first of all they say cnn says one of marjorie stoneman douglas
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:48:03.800]  high school's most visible student activist that was you you made him that you made him most visible
[02:48:03.800 --> 02:48:10.520]  you gave all the attention to hog you made him attention hog you made him camera hog that was
[02:48:10.520 --> 02:48:19.480]  you cnn literally literally that was you and the democrat party in the fbi so you so so they
[02:48:19.480 --> 02:48:27.640]  create camera hog they create this political this political pawn literally a creation from their own
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:34.600]  hands and then they say as if it's some sort of organic thing oh david hog is just so coherent
[02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:39.880]  and so good and has so much organic grassroots support he just gets all this visibility and it's
[02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:48.040]  like no he's a create he's a creation of you cnn you created david hog you created the camera hog
[02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:56.360]  you created the attention hog you not america you the anti americans and then they say he's
[02:48:56.360 --> 02:49:01.560]  going to take a year off of college to work on the midterm elections he's going to be a political
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:08.760]  activist you know what's funny about this now david hog might be a different story he could be you
[02:49:08.760 --> 02:49:14.680]  know he could end up at cnn that might be his fate but all of the other students involved in this
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:21.320]  for the anti-gun thing they're getting all this attention and and and thinking that they've made
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:25.320]  it now they're big their celebrities i mean you know what it's like when you're in high school you
[02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:35.080]  know your mind operates differently and can basically you can have beliefs systems or understand
[02:49:35.080 --> 02:49:39.160]  priorities that are just totally out of whack because you're just simply too young to have
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:45.800]  the life experience understand it and so they get all of this build up and they don't understand
[02:49:45.800 --> 02:49:51.400]  they're going to be crushed these people have now peaked in high school you've now peaked in
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:55.480]  high school and you have all these huge expectations for the rest of your lives and you don't even
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:50:02.520]  realize you're going to be nothing you're going to be exposed as liberal morons
[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:11.880]  but that ride the wave now ride that wave baby because it's about to cascade hard into a rock wall
[02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:21.560]  david hog will take off cause he's he's just you know i mean he camera hog is so selfless
[02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:29.160]  that he's going to skip college to to to work in a political field yes and and and the media was cnn
[02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:36.920]  he's basically a saint he's skipping college to to to do the right thing and he was just
[02:50:36.920 --> 02:50:43.240]  an organic grassroots creation even though cnn totally made him and it's like really oh yeah he
[02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:49.880]  must be really struggling he must oh boy he's not going to college oh no oh my gosh oh an 18 year

[02:51:14.760 --> 02:51:20.680]  for his testimony facebook anti-gun platform zuckerberg has full armed security when he arrives at dc
[02:51:22.120 --> 02:51:27.320]  president trump gets elected says we're going to return the power to you the people and take it away
[02:51:27.320 --> 02:51:34.200]  from dc and then dc wants to start a war in syria and have a regime change and then they get what they
[02:51:34.200 --> 02:51:38.600]  want at least that's what it looks like at this point so let me take a couple more calls here
[02:51:38.600 --> 02:51:44.920]  for matt bracken is going to take over in the fourth hour sarah sanders saying that trump
[02:51:44.920 --> 02:51:53.320]  stands behind his comments made on syria more bad news there but let's go to jay in Missouri who wants
[02:51:53.320 --> 02:52:01.720]  to talk about syria go ahead jay yes um i think your caller from kansas city did a good job outlining
[02:52:01.720 --> 02:52:09.720]  the blackmail angle and uh i've you know i'm sitting here wondering is trump compromised and
[02:52:09.720 --> 02:52:18.440]  it's so to what degree and i uh actually caught jack the sevix periscope today and he was saying
[02:52:18.440 --> 02:52:26.040]  that he didn't feel like trump was the one who wrote those tweets about syria 22 hours ago and
[02:52:27.800 --> 02:52:31.000]  so i'm wondering you know all right let me go down that train of thought let me go down
[02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:37.560]  that train of thought first of all i haven't talked to jack about this uh i don't agree with jack i i
[02:52:37.560 --> 02:52:43.320]  don't see this and even if that's true it's not an excuse especially now that you have the white
[02:52:43.320 --> 02:52:47.640]  house echoing a statement saying he's confident in the statements so whether that's true or not now
[02:52:47.640 --> 02:52:54.520]  becomes irrelevant to me and let's say that was true then okay well he should come out and say
[02:52:54.520 --> 02:52:58.440]  something but of course he doesn't want to because then it'll be white house and chaos trump can't
[02:52:58.440 --> 02:53:04.200]  even control his own twitter but i'm not buying that this is a hundred percent of trump tweet to me
[02:53:04.200 --> 02:53:14.120]  i just don't buy it that's me personally and as far as you know what that means okay so you're
[02:53:14.120 --> 02:53:18.200]  telling me now that trump is just totally not in control i mean you know he can't even control his
[02:53:18.200 --> 02:53:24.840]  own twitter now the one thing that we gave him the leeway on to to to be out there we gave him
[02:53:24.840 --> 02:53:28.440]  the leeway there because that was the only way that he could control what came out he could control
[02:53:28.440 --> 02:53:32.200]  the narrative now he doesn't even have control of that so he doesn't have control of foreign policy
[02:53:32.200 --> 02:53:37.480]  and he doesn't have control of his own twitter account and i'm supposed to make uh shine it and
[02:53:37.480 --> 02:53:43.720]  put makeup on that pig i don't think so jay i'm sorry i just can't do it thank you for the call
[02:53:43.720 --> 02:53:47.800]  though and uh thank you for your support of info wars i think uh i think i know who you are and
[02:53:47.800 --> 02:53:55.160]  thank you for submitting your videos to me let's go to kevin in jacksonville go ahead kevin thank
[02:53:55.160 --> 02:53:59.560]  you man i just wanted to make two quick points about facebook you kind of uh laid them both out
[02:53:59.560 --> 02:54:04.680]  but i don't think uh anything's gonna happen to zuckerberg um number one because as you pointed
[02:54:04.680 --> 02:54:10.520]  out in your incredible piece a couple minutes ago he is a puppet for the powers that be and why would
[02:54:10.520 --> 02:54:17.240]  they want to take down somebody who knows their most deepest darkest secrets um so he's got that
[02:54:17.240 --> 02:54:23.480]  under their thumb but do you think he remains but do you think he remains the ceo uh i i think he
[02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:27.960]  does because i i think he's he's become bigger than facebook i mean if you remember so it's
[02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:32.280]  just like so it's just like oh i'm sorry and then just wipe your hands of it nothing changes
[02:54:33.320 --> 02:54:39.000]  like like the same like uh like a typical slap on the wrist they're because i you know and i think
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:43.560]  you could be right because i said this earlier too i think the guy has legal defense i mean if
[02:54:43.560 --> 02:54:48.280]  they want to try to say oh you know you're gathering all this data and they'll get him to admit all of
[02:54:48.280 --> 02:54:52.760]  it he'll admit all of it but he has a legal defense to me because everybody agreed to the terms of
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:59.960]  service exactly you pointed out in that piece some of some of these terms of services are 50 60 and
[02:54:59.960 --> 02:55:07.080]  70 pages long like you said nobody reads it they for convenience they just hit accept um so i don't
[02:55:07.080 --> 02:55:12.280]  think anything's gonna happen and number two he's gotta stay on there because he's the figurehead
[02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:18.680]  of what you pointed out that facebook is the world's biggest spreader of propaganda that's the only
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:25.880]  way that cnn and msnbc and all these dinosaur dying lying medias can get their propaganda out because
[02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:31.560]  as most people know most people do independent streaming i don't know anybody who really has
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:37.000]  cable anymore everything's internet based right right and and then they need to have control
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:45.000]  over facebook so that they can censor us censor conservatives and then and then inflate the
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:53.240]  propaganda of cnn and the msnbc and others exactly look at facebook's biggest donors it's a pharmaceutical
[02:55:53.240 --> 02:55:59.160]  companies it's junk food companies you know alex jones had mike adams on a fantastic
[02:55:59.160 --> 02:56:04.360]  sitting in a couple ways ago and he said if you eat garbage your brains and they're turned into it
[02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:11.000]  you know yeah you want what you eat they're programming these kids to not think for themselves
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:17.960]  to do the the basic tribalism identify with that your next closest friend don't be a free thinker
[02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:22.280]  it's the same reason in schools what's the first thing they cut out art and music what's the easiest
[02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:28.760]  way to express yourself art and music yeah so or or or or you know pe where you need the physical
[02:56:28.760 --> 02:56:35.080]  activity of running around so that you're not sitting in a classroom for seven hours a day exactly
[02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:41.720]  there's been studies showing that since they've cut out pe the uh adhd has dawned up because
[02:56:41.720 --> 02:56:46.200]  how are you gonna tell a child with all this energy to sit still and don't say a word for eight
[02:56:46.200 --> 02:56:54.360]  nine nine get in line and shut up exactly and i and i agree with you good call kevin from florida
[02:56:54.360 --> 02:56:58.520]  but but something's gonna happen with this facebook zuckerberg deal i mean something's
[02:56:58.520 --> 02:57:03.240]  gonna happen i don't know what it is i'm not saying zuckerberg maybe on the outs maybe he is
[02:57:03.240 --> 02:57:09.080]  maybe isn't but something is gonna happen there has to be some sort of legal precedent that comes
[02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:15.400]  out of this whether it's terms of service stuff whether it's data mining and sharing of information
[02:57:15.400 --> 02:57:22.760]  stuff whether it's honestly zuckerberg's genuine like look okay you know maybe we were doing this
[02:57:22.760 --> 02:57:26.920]  wrong but i was trying to make money here and and he just outs the whole deal i don't know what it is
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:31.720]  but but something has to come of this this can't just be a nothing burger and if it is then once
[02:57:31.720 --> 02:57:38.760]  again you look at congress and you just say wow you suck you suck congress and you have sucked
[02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:43.320]  for too long and so we need to do something in 2018 but the democrats put so much propaganda out
[02:57:43.320 --> 02:57:49.000]  there might not be possible the reason in four's life has five star ratings on major third party
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:53.560]  sites is because i want products i'm gonna use for my family i take this my family takes this

[02:59:42.040 --> 02:59:53.640]  so much for being part of the second american revolution you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:59:53.640 --> 03:00:13.800]  info wars dot com is tomorrow's news today you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:17.160 --> 03:00:22.920]  well i'm about to bring in matt bracken on the other side of this short segment and you know i
[03:00:22.920 --> 03:00:31.640]  didn't even get to half the news i needed to get to today you've got the anti soros prime minister
[03:00:31.640 --> 03:00:41.160]  he gets reelected to his third term victor orbin and he could be targeting soros real soon it'd
[03:00:41.160 --> 03:00:46.280]  be nice if we could get some of that in america but no we just get a foreign invasion of syria
[03:00:46.280 --> 03:00:53.160]  uh like you know this see it's something like this that because of the political nonsense
[03:00:53.160 --> 03:00:57.480]  that we have to cover every day we don't actually get to have a real discussion
[03:00:58.520 --> 03:01:05.160]  the headline warning sex robots could change humanity forever thanks to too easy sex so it's
[03:01:05.160 --> 03:01:12.920]  like this should be a huge story this should be like all right let's literally talk about our humanity
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:19.560]  let's talk about our survival were we programmed for were we programmed to have sex for pleasure
[03:01:20.280 --> 03:01:27.560]  or were we programmed to have sex to procreate and so depending on where you fall in line with that
[03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:35.080]  you have to say okay well if we were designed to have sex to procreate this could essentially kill
[03:01:35.080 --> 03:01:40.760]  us because now we're just having sex for pleasure with inanimate objects but we don't get to have
[03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:48.440]  that discussion because we're too busy dealing with fake news false flags and political mumbo
[03:01:48.440 --> 03:01:55.080]  jumbo every day so that's fine sex robots could literally f us out of existence how do you like that
[03:01:57.960 --> 03:02:05.560]  and another UFO story buzz aldrin passes lie detector test claiming he saw a UFO
[03:02:05.560 --> 03:02:11.080]  i mean if you believe it i'm just i'm just reporting on it but here's the thing there's
[03:02:11.080 --> 03:02:19.480]  been so much news about UFOs and aliens and and contact and all of this stuff they're either about
[03:02:19.480 --> 03:02:28.600]  to reveal some real stuff or they're about to have some new false flag like project bluebeam
[03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:35.640]  to push some new agenda or to lie about something else something's coming with UFOs and aliens folks
[03:02:35.640 --> 03:02:41.880]  again i'm not saying i mean what what i believe is irrelevant i'm saying something is coming down
[03:02:41.880 --> 03:02:49.640]  they're greasing the skids for some big UFO alien reveal whether it's real or not we'll have the
[03:02:49.640 --> 03:02:54.440]  debate when it comes but i'm telling you button down the hatches because they are greasing the
[03:02:54.440 --> 03:03:00.280]  skids for some big alien reveal here soon so there's a couple of the things here i didn't
[03:03:00.280 --> 03:03:05.880]  even get to i mean just just you know china installed military jamming equipment on spark
[03:03:05.880 --> 03:03:13.160]  on spratley islands oh but see oh another example syria oh syrian regime big problem
[03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:16.760]  gassing its own people even though it doesn't make any sense at all we don't really have evidence
[03:03:16.760 --> 03:03:22.280]  we just have hearsay and you know they uh we want war there though there syria is the problem
[03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:29.640]  china is is militarizing the south china seas where there's an actual real debate over who
[03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:34.200]  should control that area and they just come in build islands militarize the whole deal
[03:03:34.200 --> 03:03:39.320]  oh but no no no intervention there and you know of course you don't want to intervene there you
[03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:43.480]  can't bully china out of existence but syria that's real easy we'll bully aside out of power
[03:03:45.320 --> 03:03:49.080]  chinese facial recognition company becomes world's most valuable ai startup
[03:03:49.080 --> 03:03:54.600]  this is just a i mean if you want if you're a person that likes making money in the stock market
[03:03:54.600 --> 03:04:04.360]  the surest bet right now for for short term long term is ai for the next 10 years ai is going to
[03:04:04.920 --> 03:04:11.080]  take off like a rocket and then after that i i would be maybe a little concerned that there
[03:04:11.080 --> 03:04:17.160]  could be some backlash and people might want to throttle back the ai but for the next decade ai is
[03:04:17.160 --> 03:04:23.080]  about the surest bet i would say you could have on the stock market um which they're saying is now
[03:04:23.080 --> 03:04:28.520]  cooling after the trump bump well it's actually the trump mountain and the last i checked they were
[03:04:28.520 --> 03:04:35.640]  up today the stocks were up today the stock market's a roller coaster and if you study its trends you
[03:04:35.640 --> 03:04:40.440]  can you can kind of figure out what what drives it but matt bracken joins me on their side we're
[03:04:40.440 --> 03:04:44.840]  going to talk syria and the potential regime change and we'll take a couple of these callers
[03:04:44.840 --> 03:04:48.200]  that have been holding for a while as well yeah the stocks are still up today all right we'll be
[03:04:48.200 --> 03:04:57.320]  right back with matt bracken on the other side get ready for alex jones to invade the swamp
[03:04:57.320 --> 03:05:02.760]  jones is set to give a speech at the national press club in washington dc on april 10th during
[03:05:02.760 --> 03:05:07.480]  which he'll make a statement on the raft of anti free speech lawsuits targeting his first
[03:05:07.480 --> 03:05:11.960]  amendment rights numerous lawsuits have been launched on the premise of attracting media
[03:05:11.960 --> 03:05:17.800]  attention and defaming alex jones and info wars' reputation jones will address the left's new
[03:05:17.800 --> 03:05:24.280]  tactic of trying to bury info wars under a deluge of lawsuits several of which do not rest on any
[03:05:24.280 --> 03:05:30.200]  sound legal basis while the mainstream media and many on the left routinely celebrate these lawsuits
[03:05:30.200 --> 03:05:35.480]  when they're first filed those same people are noticeably silent when the lawsuits collapse
[03:05:35.480 --> 03:05:41.160]  these lawsuits are yet another attempt to shut down free speech and they are doomed to fail alex
[03:05:41.160 --> 03:05:47.480]  jones will go live at nine a.m. eastern from the national press club in washington dc you can find
[03:05:47.480 --> 03:05:53.080]  live streams of the press conference at info wars dot com leon macadoo info wars dot com
[03:06:04.360 --> 03:06:11.000]  alex jones the cure to fake news coming to you live from
[03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:12.200]  austin texas
[03:06:16.760 --> 03:06:24.200]  see the reason why the news cycle or or or just in general stories and developments are so paramount
[03:06:24.200 --> 03:06:28.680]  right now is because you have all of these different factors and all of these different
[03:06:28.680 --> 03:06:34.120]  developments that are reaching a nexus point like the political divide in america between the left
[03:06:34.120 --> 03:06:39.240]  and the right that's reaching a nexus point they're calling for civil war you know fake news versus
[03:06:39.240 --> 03:06:44.680]  real news that's reaching a nexus point so they're trying to censor the first amendment and free
[03:06:44.680 --> 03:06:50.840]  speech uh you know gun control versus the narrative in the agenda of the democrats to brainwash people
[03:06:50.840 --> 03:06:56.520]  against the second amendment and then use shootings to push that agenda that's reaching a nexus point
[03:06:58.280 --> 03:07:04.760]  false flags regime change overseas americans are sick of it they're aware of it now but here we go
[03:07:04.760 --> 03:07:09.480]  again and it looks like another one's building that's reaching a nexus point and where we go from
[03:07:09.480 --> 03:07:14.760]  each of those nexus points determines our future and that's why the times we're living in right now
[03:07:14.760 --> 03:07:25.480]  are so important and truly incredible honestly and man if you are entertained by the kardashians
[03:07:25.480 --> 03:07:34.600]  or the jersey shore or mindless entertainment like that i mean yeah like you know you're you're honestly
[03:07:34.600 --> 03:07:41.160]  like five pegs down from where you need to be right now mentally you're like five pegs down
[03:07:41.160 --> 03:07:46.840]  where you need to be right now intellectually for this war for the information war for the spiritual
[03:07:46.840 --> 03:07:54.520]  war if you're still obsessed with mindless entertainment you are five pegs below where
[03:07:54.520 --> 03:08:00.520]  you need to be for these nexus points that we're crossing right now now matt bracken has been well
[03:08:00.520 --> 03:08:05.800]  aware of this especially with the domestic issues he covers that at enemies foreign domestic
[03:08:05.800 --> 03:08:11.960]  dot com his website um matt hearing everything that's going on now in syria and the way they're
[03:08:11.960 --> 03:08:19.320]  spinning it and and the way trump is approaching this it has to scare you into being like wait a
[03:08:19.320 --> 03:08:25.640]  second is this the deep state running the trump administration now the whole thing we said wasn't
[03:08:25.640 --> 03:08:32.680]  going to happen yeah i think so and you know it's been kind of a conundrum trying to um
[03:08:33.960 --> 03:08:38.920]  correlate what's happening with syria and the generals that don't want us to get out
[03:08:40.040 --> 03:08:45.480]  with what's happening with the the justice department and the slow walking of the documents
[03:08:45.480 --> 03:08:51.880]  everybody's saying but he appointed rozenstein you know he appointed these people it shows how
[03:08:51.880 --> 03:08:58.600]  powerful the influence of the deep state is even guys that trump they that the deep state recommends
[03:08:58.600 --> 03:09:07.000]  the trump to hire like rozenstein he's just another tool so trump coming in as a non-politician he had
[03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:12.360]  no clue and something about the generals that's very important is that you know there's still a
[03:09:12.360 --> 03:09:19.400]  revolving door between you know the the flag officers who are who are chosen by the senate
[03:09:19.400 --> 03:09:25.240]  you know so it's very political that the the senior generals they do a rotating they're
[03:09:25.240 --> 03:09:31.640]  revolving door straight into the corporate world the you know defense them the the daddy warbucks
[03:09:31.640 --> 03:09:40.040]  world world and they get their pay for what they do as a general after they retire so there's a lot
[03:09:40.040 --> 03:09:46.120]  of bribery that happens on a delayed timeline where it's hard to prove because oh wait he's
[03:09:46.120 --> 03:09:50.520]  going to retire next year and he's just going to happen to sit on a board where he never has to show
[03:09:50.520 --> 03:09:56.120]  up but he'll be paid five million dollars a year by you know rockwell or mcdonnell douglas or you
[03:09:56.120 --> 03:10:02.520]  know whoever um so yeah there's a very uh the deep state doesn't even begin to scratch it when it
[03:10:02.520 --> 03:10:08.360]  comes to things like you know macro issues like the war in syria and it's and it's as it's been
[03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:15.480]  noted all day every time Assad is close to consolidating his control again there's a timely
[03:10:15.480 --> 03:10:21.800]  poison gas attack directly against Assad's interest i mean he he doesn't need to do this
[03:10:22.440 --> 03:10:28.200]  it hurts him there's an old latin one of the main latin phrases that everybody learns is
[03:10:28.200 --> 03:10:37.000]  kui bono who benefits but you know at the at the first level thinking sheep level of cognizance
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:43.320]  it's just the media said that Assad gassed his own people let's go to war and i'm hearing that on
[03:10:43.320 --> 03:10:48.440]  talk radio by people that should know better and you know we're we're seeing the white hat
[03:10:48.440 --> 03:10:53.800]  coming in exactly perfect i'm so glad you said that so yeah that's what amazed me too it's like
[03:10:55.080 --> 03:10:59.880]  people that were behind trump that are conservatives you hear them just totally going along with this
[03:10:59.880 --> 03:11:04.760]  attack in syria and you're like no this is not why we've supported trump how can you say you supported
[03:11:04.760 --> 03:11:10.680]  the trump you know the trump idea and then support another foreign war in syria and then you mentioned
[03:11:10.680 --> 03:11:15.880]  the white hats oh you know they just happen to have all this hd footage every time this attack
[03:11:15.880 --> 03:11:19.480]  happens and they're saving the people and the white hats are there on the scene every time i mean
[03:11:19.480 --> 03:11:24.920]  you know people don't even ask the basic questions anymore matt bracken yeah i i i need to you know
[03:11:24.920 --> 03:11:30.280]  my first novel enemies foreign and domestic is a false flag novels you know shooting into a stadium
[03:11:30.280 --> 03:11:36.440]  to trash the second amendment but there was another famous false flag in recent history
[03:11:36.440 --> 03:11:42.760]  this was in the 90s in sarajevo when the the serb republic was doing relatively well
[03:11:43.720 --> 03:11:49.320]  and we weren't we were clinton didn't want to get involved in bosnia and nato didn't want to get
[03:11:49.320 --> 03:11:56.440]  involved and a 120 millimeter mortar shell that's big that's like five inches which is these things
[03:11:56.440 --> 03:12:02.520]  are monsters they weigh like you know 30 pounds most of which is the explosive charge and it just
[03:12:02.520 --> 03:12:09.000]  happened to detonate right in the middle of a market on a market day and killed 68 bosnians
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:15.800]  and wounded around 200 with the perfect timing you know nobody saw it coming generally mortars
[03:12:15.800 --> 03:12:20.840]  you have to walk the fire in i mean their their registration is good but not that good
[03:12:20.840 --> 03:12:26.680]  it was very you know immediately in the weeks after that we did major attacks against the
[03:12:26.680 --> 03:12:33.880]  serb republic in support of the bosnians and and later analysis showed from the crater that
[03:12:33.880 --> 03:12:39.480]  and wasn't that on the heels of some clinton some clinton botch up some some clinton activity
[03:12:39.480 --> 03:12:44.360]  that they were trying to distract from too i can't you know i can't remember the timeline but it's
[03:12:44.360 --> 03:12:51.080]  see it seems like in history the same plans the same patterns repeat over and over again
[03:12:51.080 --> 03:12:57.080]  which is why the you know the the new world order likes dumb citizens that's why they like
[03:12:57.080 --> 03:13:03.640]  mass importing millions of low iq future welfare voters they don't care if our country becomes
[03:13:03.640 --> 03:13:10.680]  venezuela as long as the left will be in charge because you know there are two ways to get fabulously
[03:13:10.680 --> 03:13:16.200]  wealthy in this world you can either be a capitalist and invent something make a product or a service
[03:13:16.200 --> 03:13:21.720]  make millions of dollars or if you're not that creative not that smart but you're ruthless and
[03:13:21.720 --> 03:13:28.680]  evil you can become a left-wing socialist you know dictator or one of his lackeys then you'll
[03:13:28.680 --> 03:13:34.440]  you'll rule over a crumbling empire like cuba or venezuela but it won't matter because your villa
[03:13:34.440 --> 03:13:38.200]  will have a giant wall matt bracken is about to take over here and i'm going to leave you
[03:13:38.200 --> 03:13:41.880]  and i just want to make one statement here before i let you go because it's exactly what
[03:13:41.880 --> 03:13:46.440]  you're talking about with with people not knowing their history so they're doomed to repeat it and
[03:13:46.440 --> 03:13:51.560]  i said this earlier and i didn't really get to pontificate on it if they can erase history
[03:13:51.560 --> 03:13:54.840]  they can erase the future okay that sounds crazy what are you talking about shroyer
[03:13:55.400 --> 03:14:01.800]  you see if they can erase history and and and simply determine the the historical narrative
[03:14:01.800 --> 03:14:06.040]  regardless of facts regardless on what actually happened they can just tell you the story of
[03:14:06.040 --> 03:14:12.520]  history and then that becomes history 1984 style even though it's not real then they can control
[03:14:12.520 --> 03:14:18.680]  the future you see anything they do in the future won't matter because they're going to lie about it
[03:14:18.680 --> 03:14:25.160]  and then whatever the history is is the lie not what actually happened so if they can erase history
[03:14:25.160 --> 03:14:29.400]  not only do they have the brainwash people that know no history and then are doomed to repeat it
[03:14:30.120 --> 03:14:33.960]  then they know they've set the precedent well we now control the future narrative
[03:14:33.960 --> 03:14:38.280]  because whatever we do we're going to lie about it and put a bunch of propaganda out there with
[03:14:38.280 --> 03:14:43.720]  our controlled media and they'll never know so it's like history never actually existed
[03:14:43.720 --> 03:14:48.760]  just the propaganda so matt bragan i'm going to sign off you got 60 seconds left this segment
[03:14:48.760 --> 03:14:53.480]  i know that you got a lot to cover uh just tell the guest uh the audience what to expect here

[03:21:24.120 --> 03:21:30.280]  and i learned how to do what you're what you're picking up now and um i got out before i got killed
[03:21:30.280 --> 03:21:35.720]  um so far you know i'm gonna get a little uh christian on you um
[03:21:37.400 --> 03:21:42.760]  the uh all you all battles are spiritual they're a reflection of some mighty battles
[03:21:42.760 --> 03:21:47.640]  going on in the heavenlies down here that's what i believe so i also believe the will of god is
[03:21:47.640 --> 03:21:54.600]  enough to a committee i think so far trump shows every every sign of having been anointed of having
[03:21:54.600 --> 03:22:01.080]  chosen um it's kind of like daniel in the lion's den you know he walks through incredible things
[03:22:01.080 --> 03:22:06.520]  and uh and uh and nothing touches him now i know he's had attempts on his life and his wife and
[03:22:06.520 --> 03:22:14.280]  family and all um and um but he's been laying with some snakes and he's going to get bit and
[03:22:14.280 --> 03:22:21.880]  but here's the deal about syria number well and muller i think trump is being played i think he
[03:22:21.880 --> 03:22:28.040]  has a monumental ego and and uh on muller he wants to go and sit in front of his worst enemy
[03:22:28.040 --> 03:22:35.160]  and on syria uh if we get into a war um he's on the side of mccain and graham and bolton
[03:22:35.160 --> 03:22:39.960]  and everybody else and i run from those guys i don't want to be on their side so you got to take
[03:22:39.960 --> 03:22:49.560]  a quick look at you know what side who's who's cheering this on um uh so uh as far as uh the
[03:22:49.560 --> 03:22:55.720]  real tip off is we've been backing isis in syria and i couldn't get that right i mean there were
[03:22:55.720 --> 03:23:01.320]  butchers i mean they're awful and uh it was the it was the free syrian army come on it was the free
[03:23:01.320 --> 03:23:09.400]  syrian army and but so we were backing them and i couldn't figure it out and all of a sudden you
[03:23:09.400 --> 03:23:13.560]  know we're leaving and now all of a sudden we get this big problem you know we've got to stay
[03:23:13.560 --> 03:23:20.600]  hey well that's kind of transparent to me and uh we have no proof and uh and and so you guys are
[03:23:20.600 --> 03:23:27.320]  right i heard three call hosts hang up on people because uh this take on things that there's a
[03:23:27.320 --> 03:23:36.280]  false flag going on uh if if american action kills one one russian okay if we go in there
[03:23:36.280 --> 03:23:42.440]  and one russian dies if i was putin i'd have a big problem i think well we already did a couple
[03:23:42.440 --> 03:23:50.360]  weeks ago we killed uh it's it's been the number given is approximately 200 russians who were some
[03:23:50.360 --> 03:23:58.200]  oligarch who's a you know a uh a a stand in for putin sort of an eric prince blackwater situation
[03:23:58.200 --> 03:24:02.040]  where they were crossing a river to make an attack and we took them out with air power
[03:24:02.040 --> 03:24:07.000]  supposedly that's the story you know so we've already killed a couple hundred russians and
[03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:13.480]  anytime you've got you know a russian blackwater type of an outfit uh you can bet that there are
[03:24:13.480 --> 03:24:21.960]  some active duty guys uh either fsb or or um you know spetsnaz who are sheep dipped as civilians to
[03:24:21.960 --> 03:24:26.840]  accompany them and advise them so you know we're edging closer and closer to an all out war with
[03:24:26.840 --> 03:24:32.440]  russia we've been arming the ukrainians and so forth you know we are the middle east is such an
[03:24:32.440 --> 03:24:38.200]  area of strange bedfellows we've got the saudis and the israelis allied to keep us in syria
[03:24:39.240 --> 03:24:46.600]  and we've got russia and iran and and asad they all have their own goals but you know the the big
[03:24:46.600 --> 03:24:51.080]  ferret is that they're going to build a highway straight from you know from the mediterranean
[03:24:51.080 --> 03:24:59.160]  to iran you know a land bridge for iranian power projection supposedly and these generals that
[03:24:59.160 --> 03:25:04.440]  that have their own agendas and they're coming up on retirement and they get the little whisper
[03:25:04.440 --> 03:25:11.000]  that as soon as they retire if they play the right hand while their generals they they stand
[03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:17.400]  to become uh you know on the board of directors of these megabucks daddy warbucks corporations
[03:25:17.400 --> 03:25:23.400]  where they'll make five million a year to never do anything except maybe go to a stockholders meeting
[03:25:23.400 --> 03:25:29.480]  so you know we're in it the swamp doesn't even even cover what's going on in washington and
[03:25:30.040 --> 03:25:35.400]  you know god bless trump that he can he can come through this uh you know this is like a den of
[03:25:35.400 --> 03:25:41.240]  infected lions without getting infected himself it's as far as the spiritual battle i agree but
[03:25:41.240 --> 03:25:50.120]  even if somebody doesn't believe in god or is not a christian natural law is also a way to look at
[03:25:50.120 --> 03:25:55.800]  this whether you look at it through the prism of judaeo christian belief versus you know islam
[03:25:55.800 --> 03:26:01.960]  and plus socialism which seems to be the battle lines today or just natural law you know we've
[03:26:01.960 --> 03:26:07.560]  we have things going on today that definitely tell me that uh you know if we're not on the if we're
[03:26:07.560 --> 03:26:12.200]  not on the uh one yard line of the end times i don't know what else explains all of this
[03:26:12.200 --> 03:26:20.600]  you know i i agree with you totally um i just i had a friend that served in afghanistan
[03:26:22.200 --> 03:26:28.520]  he said paul we were over there guarding the poppy fields and that's one of our biggest problems
[03:26:28.520 --> 03:26:34.600]  and it's farm big pharma and then it's the drug trade all it takes is some atrazine and we are
[03:26:34.600 --> 03:26:40.760]  done with that but our guys were in afghanistan guarding poppy fields and those fields are still
[03:26:40.760 --> 03:26:48.600]  there so i don't you know i just it's it's a monumental the kind of battle trump has been
[03:26:48.600 --> 03:26:55.400]  fighting but um i don't know that we've got enough uh uh uh half america is going to actually get out
[03:26:55.400 --> 03:27:02.440]  and help this uh president do anything because congress is such a mess and that's why that's
[03:27:02.440 --> 03:27:08.360]  why info wars is so important there is a war on for your mind this is a battle of narratives
[03:27:08.360 --> 03:27:15.160]  and if the mainstream media the zuckerbergs the you know the google's the facebook's the twitter's
[03:27:15.720 --> 03:27:21.400]  if they're going to be allowed to shape the narrative then we are on the uh fast track to hell
[03:27:21.960 --> 03:27:28.040]  period so it's why it's so important for people to support shows like this because without it
[03:27:28.040 --> 03:27:32.600]  all we're going to get is the uh you know the right wing profit or excuse me the you know the
[03:27:32.600 --> 03:27:39.240]  the left wing propaganda narrative and if it wasn't for fox news talk radio and the wet and the
[03:27:39.240 --> 03:27:46.120]  internet but the internet seems to be continually more restricted i mean i've been banned on facebook
[03:27:46.680 --> 03:27:51.640]  four months out of the last six months and they don't tell me why they just say you may have used
[03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:58.120]  it inappropriately you can post again in 29 days there but there's no button to click what happened
[03:27:58.120 --> 03:28:04.600]  you know that i assume like diamond and silk that i'm a you know i'm uh a danger to the community
[03:28:04.600 --> 03:28:10.760]  of social justice warrior progressives you know so there there is a battle on for the narrative
[03:28:10.760 --> 03:28:15.560]  the battle for our minds and that's why we have to to support info wars and other programs
[03:28:16.920 --> 03:28:23.160]  local tv stations and i've fired three three times i've fired people for lying on the air

[03:31:09.080 --> 03:31:15.560]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain
[03:31:15.560 --> 03:31:21.480]  quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this
[03:31:21.480 --> 03:31:26.760]  effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast
[03:31:26.760 --> 03:31:32.840]  acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural
[03:31:32.840 --> 03:31:38.520]  and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts
[03:31:38.520 --> 03:31:43.880]  by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory

[03:32:02.280 --> 03:32:07.000]  which he'll make a statement on the raft of anti-free speech lawsuits targeting his first
[03:32:07.000 --> 03:32:11.480]  amendment rights numerous lawsuits have been launched on the premise of attracting media
[03:32:11.480 --> 03:32:17.320]  attention and defaming alex jones and info wars' reputation jones will address the left's new
[03:32:17.320 --> 03:32:23.800]  tactic of trying to bury info wars under a deluge of lawsuits several of which do not rest on any
[03:32:23.800 --> 03:32:29.720]  sound legal basis while the mainstream media and many on the left routinely celebrate these lawsuits
[03:32:29.720 --> 03:32:35.000]  when they're first filed those same people are noticeably silent when the lawsuits collapse
[03:32:35.000 --> 03:32:40.680]  these lawsuits are yet another attempt to shut down free speech and they are doomed to fail alex
[03:32:40.680 --> 03:32:47.000]  jones will go live at nine a.m. eastern from the national press club in washington dc you can find

[03:33:26.760 --> 03:33:32.520]  yeah this is matt bracken in for alex the fourth hour following uh owens capable uh
[03:33:32.520 --> 03:33:39.560]  yes hosting you know it's amazing that uh the intro music takes me back a little bit and it and
[03:33:39.560 --> 03:33:46.120]  you just my mind just boggles at what jimmy hendrix could have done if he had uh lived he was a
[03:33:46.120 --> 03:33:54.360]  creative genius that man um you know folks this this uh programming doesn't just come free and uh
[03:33:55.000 --> 03:34:00.680]  the info wars store is how it all happens and if you want more than just the you know the mainstream
[03:34:00.680 --> 03:34:08.760]  media propaganda narrative you've got to support the info wars stores and uh today there's 50 off the
[03:34:09.320 --> 03:34:15.560]  best-selling brain force plus and there's just a limited time to get 50 off on this
[03:34:15.560 --> 03:34:22.120]  all of the info wars staff uses this stuff to stay sharp and i'm i'm sure uh it can help me too
[03:34:22.840 --> 03:34:28.200]  but um if we don't if we don't support the info wars stores this programming goes away because
[03:34:28.200 --> 03:34:33.560]  the forces that are arrayed against it are just massive so whether you're going to stock up or
[03:34:33.560 --> 03:34:40.680]  just give it a try go to the info wars stores and and look for the uh brain force plus and the
[03:34:40.680 --> 03:34:46.360]  brain force plus and the real red pill mind and body challenge pack is a limited time offer
[03:34:46.920 --> 03:34:52.840]  and this is how the programming this is how the programming is supported there's no other way
[03:34:52.840 --> 03:34:58.280]  it's certainly not going to be supported by youtube google facebook or twitter so if we
[03:34:58.280 --> 03:35:03.880]  don't do it the programming disappears you know before i went lefty we were talking about some
[03:35:03.880 --> 03:35:09.560]  other topics a little bit besides uh russia which is going to be the main focus today he was talking
[03:35:09.560 --> 03:35:16.840]  about sex robots and what that might mean you know we're already seeing that with uh things that will
[03:35:16.840 --> 03:35:22.120]  allow men to be gratified without actually going through all the trouble of pursuing an actual
[03:35:22.120 --> 03:35:27.400]  living breathing woman i think this has got a lot to do with why the birth rate in europe is
[03:35:27.400 --> 03:35:33.240]  is plunging off a cliff you know when when scientists are trying to defeat the mediterranean
[03:35:33.240 --> 03:35:39.640]  fruit fly which can wipe out florida's oranges you know what they do is they irradiate male
[03:35:39.640 --> 03:35:46.280]  fruit flies sterilize them and then release them so they short circuit the reproductive
[03:35:46.280 --> 03:35:52.600]  uh cycle of the fruit flies causing a die off of all of the fruit flies and i think that this is
[03:35:52.600 --> 03:35:58.760]  sort of what we're seeing now with modern technology eventually it'll be the robots but you know even
[03:35:58.760 --> 03:36:04.200]  without a robot there's a lot of other things that people can do rather than pursuing the opposite
[03:36:04.200 --> 03:36:10.360]  sex and getting married but um yeah let's get back to the main topic which is are we about to go to
[03:36:10.360 --> 03:36:17.720]  war with russia be triggered tripped into a war tricked into a war um i i really have my doubts
[03:36:17.720 --> 03:36:22.920]  about this latest supposed poison gas attack it seems like it was just chlorine which is a common
[03:36:22.920 --> 03:36:29.800]  industrial chemical we have a long history of of uh you know muslim jihadists killing their own
[03:36:29.800 --> 03:36:34.840]  people for the good of the cause of spreading islam you know the people are just strictly
[03:36:34.840 --> 03:36:42.120]  sacrificial pawns in that mindset and the ends justify the means and if the end is is uh not
[03:36:42.120 --> 03:36:47.240]  allowing Assad to win and control the territory allowing the you know whatever they're going
[03:36:47.240 --> 03:36:53.160]  to call isis next that's who he's fighting that's unfortunately the side we've been on with the cia
[03:36:53.160 --> 03:36:59.480]  and others so you know i i certainly hope that uh president trump is not uh you know lured into
[03:36:59.480 --> 03:37:05.960]  this trap but it certainly seems like we are going down that road and just remember um remember
[03:37:05.960 --> 03:37:11.400]  sarah yavo and the you know the magic mortar bomb that went off in the market and it sure seems to me
[03:37:11.400 --> 03:37:18.040]  like they're playing from the same script uh if we can go to a call now uh right on top i see uh
[03:37:18.040 --> 03:37:22.680]  benjamin in virginia one of my old stomping grounds i went to university of virginia and
[03:37:22.680 --> 03:37:29.880]  served in the navy there so uh benjamin if you can hear me uh let me hear you hey mad bracken uh
[03:37:29.880 --> 03:37:35.800]  thank you for your service and thank you for your continued patriotism thank you uh my subject today
[03:37:35.800 --> 03:37:43.240]  is uh certainly you've seen the film siriana yeah the most famous line in that is corruptions how we
[03:37:43.240 --> 03:37:50.280]  win and foreign entanglements is how we confuse you into learned helplessness helplessness but uh
[03:37:50.280 --> 03:37:59.720]  i think when it comes to syria i think there's a situation where trump should say to the russians
[03:37:59.720 --> 03:38:05.320]  perhaps if you kick a sod out and give them to us we'll just let you take over control of syria
[03:38:05.320 --> 03:38:13.720]  and and we'll get out entirely just just bail on the whole situation i don't think that a sod is
[03:38:13.720 --> 03:38:22.360]  going anywhere you know his regime cruel as it is and it's in an area known for cruelty you know
[03:38:22.360 --> 03:38:28.600]  mahat makand would last two minutes in that environment but the the syrian the syrian
[03:38:28.600 --> 03:38:34.520]  government at least doesn't wipe out its religious enemies you know they don't cut your head off if
[03:38:34.520 --> 03:38:42.440]  you can't uh recite the shahada prayer there are there are christians and alawites and other sects
[03:38:42.440 --> 03:38:48.680]  that are all part of the of a you know in the in the region a comparatively secular government
[03:38:49.240 --> 03:38:54.680]  and they're fighting religious fanatics and it just shows what a what a strange snake pit this is
[03:38:54.680 --> 03:39:01.480]  this is like trying to reach into a a rattlesnake den and find the good rattlesnake and pull him out
[03:39:01.480 --> 03:39:06.040]  without getting bitten by the bad rattlesnake when they're all twisted together and you and they all
[03:39:06.040 --> 03:39:12.840]  you know look look exactly the same uh it's a snake pit we should stay the heck out of it as far as
[03:39:12.840 --> 03:39:18.680]  i'm concerned you know we're just being lured in there with these to me a fairly obvious false
[03:39:18.680 --> 03:39:24.920]  flag attack who benefits kui bono who benefits you know it's certainly not the american people
[03:39:24.920 --> 03:39:31.400]  that are going to be you know dragged into world war three potentially i hope not but the next 24
[03:39:31.400 --> 03:39:37.000]  hours we'll probably see some military action unfortunately uh do you have another point or
[03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:42.200]  i've got a lot of callers here i did have another point um you have predicted what's about to
[03:39:42.200 --> 03:39:49.000]  happen here domestically i uh i spoke with owen and and uh rob last week and uh a false flag
[03:39:49.000 --> 03:39:53.800]  attack is coming i'd like to stop it the deep state's about to attack us and you predicted
[03:39:53.800 --> 03:39:57.720]  essentially what the target is although there's a refinement to it i think they're going to attack
[03:39:57.720 --> 03:40:06.360]  howard university and blame it on white nationalists yeah the the natural target is is a is a um
[03:40:07.080 --> 03:40:13.160]  you know it will be a left-wing group and the the either there'll be either a patsy or somebody
[03:40:13.160 --> 03:40:18.760]  that the fbi knows about but somehow they're going to drop the ball again uh if they don't
[03:40:19.800 --> 03:40:25.000]  you know escort the guy straight to the shooting position like they did in garland texas you know
[03:40:25.000 --> 03:40:31.240]  anybody that's saying matt bracken how can you possibly say this about our wonderful beloved fbi
[03:40:31.240 --> 03:40:38.200]  you know i grew up on f from zimbalist jr the fbi story these you know these great gmen we crossed
[03:40:38.200 --> 03:40:44.920]  that rubicon with fest and furious they they murdered hundreds of mexicans on purpose they
[03:40:44.920 --> 03:40:50.920]  already did that that's in the past and they got away with it congress held holder in contempt
[03:40:50.920 --> 03:40:55.960]  nothing happened to them what did they learn from that they learned that they'll never be stopped
[03:40:56.520 --> 03:41:02.520]  so this really is a titanic death match between trump and the death and the deep state and at
[03:41:02.520 --> 03:41:08.760]  this point i think the deep state has still got a lot more cards to play um but yeah i the reason
[03:41:08.760 --> 03:41:15.160]  i write about false flags so much is to try to deter people from doing them because they won't be
[03:41:15.160 --> 03:41:21.640]  believed you know the more implausible a false flag operation becomes the less likely they're
[03:41:21.640 --> 03:41:27.400]  going to try it although they they they made a good try in garland texas it thanks a lot for your

[03:45:59.400 --> 03:46:03.800]  good reason going back about five years ago we did research on what top selling new tropics were
[03:46:03.800 --> 03:46:09.080]  what were most popular what were best what people liked and we made it even stronger then we cut
[03:46:09.080 --> 03:46:14.760]  the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup we only have a hundred and
[03:46:14.760 --> 03:46:21.800]  fifty percent then it helps funder operation well now it's 50 off that means we've got a 25
[03:46:21.800 --> 03:46:28.040]  percent markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to
[03:46:28.040 --> 03:46:33.800]  kick in brain force takes about 30 minutes but the two go together it's the mind and body challenge

[03:46:41.800 --> 03:46:47.080]  and infowarslife.com but it's got to end in a couple days because both of these best sellers

[03:47:12.280 --> 03:47:15.880]  when a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac
[03:47:15.880 --> 03:47:25.160]  and he was dressed like 1950 half drunk and hollow eyed he said it's a long walk to nashfield
[03:47:25.160 --> 03:47:33.160]  would you like to ride? Waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[03:47:33.160 --> 03:47:44.120]  front lines of the info war. I'm matt fracken and i'm guest hosting for the alex jones show today
[03:47:44.120 --> 03:47:51.160]  and uh take care of a little bit more business real quick you know that if you want to support

[03:48:21.000 --> 03:48:27.320]  weekend 14 15 16th and 17th so it's a way to leverage your dollars and get way more product
[03:48:27.320 --> 03:48:34.360]  for the cost and these are all high quality products obviously they wouldn't be sold but
[03:48:34.360 --> 03:48:39.800]  if you want to make the stretch your dollar the furthest then sign up for the uh patriot reward
[03:48:39.800 --> 03:48:46.200]  system and really stretch the dollar um we're going to go back to the uh the main subject of
[03:48:46.200 --> 03:48:51.960]  the day i think is uh russia i'd like to mention before that you know that the other big story is
[03:48:51.960 --> 03:48:59.400]  is zuckerberg zuckerberg and facebook but really i look at them all together google youtube same thing
[03:48:59.400 --> 03:49:05.800]  facebook and twitter what they're doing is de facto creating a system like the chinese are using
[03:49:05.800 --> 03:49:12.680]  which they call social credit if you're a bad comrade who's resisting social progress you find
[03:49:12.680 --> 03:49:17.880]  that you can't speak in their social media platform i've been banned four months out of the last six
[03:49:17.880 --> 03:49:24.840]  on facebook um so what they're going to do eventually is just tailor trim us down turn down
[03:49:24.840 --> 03:49:29.960]  our volume until we have no voice that's why it's really important that we support info wars and the
[03:49:29.960 --> 03:49:35.960]  info wars store because it's the only way to counter their narrative anyway let's uh let's get back
[03:49:35.960 --> 03:49:43.000]  to the imminent war with russia potentially i think these uh these war generals that are looking at
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:48.440]  their payoffs with uh in you know the defense industry next year after they retire these corrupt
[03:49:48.440 --> 03:49:53.880]  generals i think they're steering the policy at this point and uh you know i've got help us if we
[03:49:53.880 --> 03:49:59.880]  go to war with russia and syria there'll be no end to it but let's go to um i see michael in new
[03:49:59.880 --> 03:50:07.720]  york he has the ultimate purpose behind syria so michael what's your theory yes hello matt and
[03:50:07.720 --> 03:50:14.680]  oh and great job guys and great callers everybody's spot on the ultimate objective sir is a necessary
[03:50:14.680 --> 03:50:21.880]  war just like the first two world wars because a great depression precedes them and if they don't
[03:50:21.880 --> 03:50:27.400]  get the great war going again then uh the blame of the great depression especially here in the united
[03:50:27.400 --> 03:50:32.360]  states when millions of americans especially middle class have been ripped off and burned out by the
[03:50:32.360 --> 03:50:37.000]  big corporations that they built up and their parents built up their relatives built up like
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:42.440]  ibm etc and then they move all their middle class decent paying salary jobs so they can afford to
[03:50:42.440 --> 03:50:48.280]  live and he's overtaxed no longer sovereign states of the united states then they're gonna we're all
[03:50:48.280 --> 03:50:52.600]  going to rise up and take out the royal child the croc of fellas the warburg the morgan the coon
[03:50:52.600 --> 03:50:59.000]  lobe shift laments and the other little families under them that i can see i can see where i can
[03:50:59.000 --> 03:51:03.880]  see where i can see where you're going michael um i can see where you're going with that um
[03:51:04.520 --> 03:51:09.960]  you know obviously there are giant global forces at work but there is no depression right now
[03:51:10.920 --> 03:51:14.840]  so at that part of your theory and you know unless you're anticipating that you know the
[03:51:14.840 --> 03:51:19.960]  debt bubble exploding in the near future but of course that's been anticipated now for years
[03:51:20.600 --> 03:51:24.920]  but uh you know when you start naming these families i think you're just you know you're
[03:51:24.920 --> 03:51:30.280]  just uh trying to say something else that you know that you'll get slammed if you say and i'll be
[03:51:30.280 --> 03:51:37.320]  doing some of that slamming myself so uh thanks for your call there and uh let's go to um chris in
[03:51:37.320 --> 03:51:45.640]  utah he says we have a false flag president chris in utah are you there yes sir you're
[03:51:45.640 --> 03:51:52.280]  doing a great job matt and thank you for your thanks so yeah what do you mean by that in 2012
[03:51:52.280 --> 03:51:56.600]  i made this prediction i figured after eight years of obama america will be ready for a
[03:51:56.600 --> 03:52:01.480]  conservative movement and that's what the deep state gave them except we don't realize it but
[03:52:01.480 --> 03:52:09.000]  donald trump is an asset of the deep state and i present a couple of items uh to the jury as evidence
[03:52:09.000 --> 03:52:15.960]  one he was given 4.5 billion dollars with the free media coverage now why didn't they do that to
[03:52:15.960 --> 03:52:21.720]  ron paul because he was a genuine threat to the deep state but i don't think donald trump is and
[03:52:21.720 --> 03:52:27.960]  here's why my prediction is within the next year to year and a half the powers that be will will
[03:52:27.960 --> 03:52:34.520]  affect an economic downturn and not only will they blame it on trump matt but they will blame it on
[03:52:34.520 --> 03:52:40.920]  the conservative movement in general that's where it gets dangerous because um people have bought
[03:52:40.920 --> 03:52:47.160]  into trump i never did i i felt right through him uh if you look into his history he's been
[03:52:47.720 --> 03:52:54.280]  anti-second amendment uh he's been pro-abortion he has donated to democratic causes i did not
[03:52:54.280 --> 03:53:00.360]  trust the man nor do i trust him today so i think they put him there they knew that we were on an
[03:53:00.360 --> 03:53:06.120]  economic bubble which a lot of people are are saying peter schiff uh to name one catherine
[03:53:06.120 --> 03:53:11.240]  austin said ron paul they've been predicting that this bubble will eventually burst i think it will
[03:53:11.240 --> 03:53:18.280]  happen within trump's presidency which will not only first christian you know it's been called the
[03:53:18.280 --> 03:53:23.240]  debt bubble could explode at any time naturally you know it might result from external forces it
[03:53:23.240 --> 03:53:28.600]  could begin in china it could begin in europe it could begin with a cyber war you know somebody
[03:53:28.600 --> 03:53:33.880]  something that people don't consider when we talk about a war in syria um you know we're not going
[03:53:33.880 --> 03:53:40.440]  to sit necessarily see russian backfire bombers flying over the polar ice cap to take out minneapolis
[03:53:40.440 --> 03:53:47.240]  you know we're going to see an unleashing of of cyber tactics that don't necessarily lead straight
[03:53:47.240 --> 03:53:53.240]  back to a silo the way a missile does and the the reason that this is so dangerous is that
[03:53:53.240 --> 03:54:00.280]  third party actors can so easily leave a false trail you know we saw with the wikipedia thing
[03:54:00.280 --> 03:54:07.560]  where uh the cia has been collecting russian hacker codes so that they can put a fake signature
[03:54:07.560 --> 03:54:14.040]  onto actual cia operations you know so we don't know now if the power goes out we might be if
[03:54:14.040 --> 03:54:19.240]  we might be told it was russia but it could be another it could be another force i mean we
[03:54:19.240 --> 03:54:24.600]  will never know that's why it's so important to uh you know keep our our minds open to all
[03:54:24.600 --> 03:54:31.800]  possibilities but as far as them giving free media coverage to trump he was a story they love a story
[03:54:31.800 --> 03:54:36.840]  and they thought that hillary would easily be able to take him out if he became nominated
[03:54:36.840 --> 03:54:41.560]  but they just couldn't resist the story they chased the they chased the red laser dot you know
[03:54:41.560 --> 03:54:47.640]  like the kittens chasing the laser so to me that that's not a question of the deep state
[03:54:47.640 --> 03:54:52.840]  wanting trump to be elected i do not i don't think they wanted to at all i i do um have
[03:54:52.840 --> 03:54:58.200]  think that he has a good heart i think that all in all you know when all is weighed his he is a
[03:54:58.200 --> 03:55:05.000]  patriot and he is a moral man i know you know billy bush this was a locker room bs chat between two
[03:55:05.000 --> 03:55:10.280]  guys that never thought it would be out as opposed to say jimmy kimmel walking around with a fake
[03:55:10.280 --> 03:55:16.040]  erection poking women like a pervert you know that was done on film to put on television as
[03:55:16.040 --> 03:55:21.800]  entertainment you know what trump was was alleged to have done was all in private having an affair
[03:55:21.800 --> 03:55:26.760]  or one nighter with uh you know stormy daniels things like that i mean come on he was a democrat
[03:55:26.760 --> 03:55:31.640]  at the time for one thing but when you weigh a man's whole life you know martin luther king he
[03:55:31.640 --> 03:55:37.400]  was a cheater does that mean we wipe him out uh you know do we tear down his statue because he
[03:55:37.400 --> 03:55:42.600]  wasn't perfect the way they're tearing down statues like of mckinley for example today
[03:55:42.600 --> 03:55:49.560]  so yeah we're we're in the middle of such a we're like on an ice uh a frozen lake the cracks are
[03:55:49.560 --> 03:55:55.000]  coming from so many directions it's going to be hard to guess which crack opens up the hole
[03:55:55.000 --> 03:56:01.240]  because there are there are so many threat vectors right now today we're focused on syria and that
[03:56:01.240 --> 03:56:06.520]  could be it but if we go to war in syria you know don't be surprised if it's not you know
[03:56:06.520 --> 03:56:12.760]  bombers and missiles but a cyber attack in our power grid so people need to seriously think about
[03:56:13.640 --> 03:56:19.720]  you know first second third level thinking and please folks why would Assad do a poison gas
[03:56:19.720 --> 03:56:26.520]  attack at this point it makes no sense who benefits you know look look deeper peel back the onion
[03:56:26.520 --> 03:56:31.160]  find out who benefits from these things and we'll have a sure sense of what's going on but
[03:56:31.160 --> 03:56:38.760]  you know god help us if we take major military action and take out russians in syria uh i mean
[03:56:38.760 --> 03:56:44.440]  active duty russians but they'll have to respond at this point uh do we have time for another
[03:56:44.440 --> 03:56:53.160]  caller or we uh almost out okay um well look we are in a dangerous time uh if you want to
[03:56:53.800 --> 03:56:58.840]  support the narrative please visit the info wars store i've been writing novels on this
