[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:34.320]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.320 --> 00:42.980]  here we are Tuesday the first day of May 2012 that's May day International
[00:42.980 --> 00:49.640]  Illuminati Communist Day which means banker anti-middle-class New World Order
[00:49.640 --> 00:54.880]  fascism day I always have ignorant people send me emails or comments or
[00:54.880 --> 01:02.520]  messages saying fascism is not communism really it's all command and control as
[01:02.520 --> 01:07.000]  the head of political science at Georgetown Carol Quigley said and he
[01:07.000 --> 01:15.720]  admitted the elite fund both major movements the elite want just enough
[01:15.720 --> 01:19.240]  socialism and communism to make you dependent and be able to steal your
[01:19.240 --> 01:23.360]  wealth and have a giant underclass they can sick almost left of the productive
[01:23.360 --> 01:31.800]  class but it's a process of breaking down society to create monopolies and
[01:31.800 --> 01:36.440]  what did John D Rockefeller the founder of the criminal dynasty say he said
[01:36.440 --> 01:47.400]  competition is a sin what do the commies say competition is a sin and I
[01:47.400 --> 01:50.520]  can't think of a better date you know I got Joel Scalzen coming up the third
[01:50.520 --> 01:55.480]  hour in studio we're gonna shoot a special presentation on preparedness
[01:55.480 --> 01:59.440]  like a two-hour special we're gonna shoot today after the show but I need to
[01:59.440 --> 02:01.840]  call him up so you can start thinking about it because one of the leading
[02:01.840 --> 02:06.600]  experts his uncle a play on Scalzen of course wrote the naked communist
[02:06.600 --> 02:11.260]  exposing how the big mega money funds the communism the socialism to
[02:11.260 --> 02:15.200]  consolidate power that's what I want to talk to Joel about today he's gonna get
[02:15.200 --> 02:18.080]  here in about an hour and a half so we need to call him on his cell and just
[02:18.080 --> 02:23.120]  say oh by the way put your thinking cap on on this subject because this is what
[02:23.120 --> 02:27.240]  Alex wants to talk about not strategic relocation spend a little bit of time on
[02:27.240 --> 02:34.840]  them but we are faced with total globalist infiltration and sabotage at
[02:34.840 --> 02:39.160]  every level they've been sabotaging this country for 60 plus years they're now
[02:39.160 --> 02:42.920]  pretty much in full control we got a handful of good house members and
[02:42.920 --> 02:47.880]  Senate members got a handful of decent governors and state legislators and the
[02:47.880 --> 02:53.280]  states are fighting back against agenda 21 but they have infiltrated every level
[02:53.280 --> 02:58.280]  of society and they know how to stage terror attacks and poses the saviors
[02:58.280 --> 03:03.360]  that's their ace in the hole a little secret that well more and more people do
[03:03.360 --> 03:08.280]  now know so we're gonna be going over all of that by the way here's the
[03:08.280 --> 03:14.240]  Washington Times new Obama's slogan has long ties to Marxism socialism now
[03:14.240 --> 03:22.440]  it's not hope and change it's forward with the revolution now the revolution
[03:22.440 --> 03:29.440]  and the raised fist mmm the weathermen all protected and funded by the big
[03:29.440 --> 03:34.200]  foundations why would Carnegie Rockefeller Ford foundations all fund the
[03:34.200 --> 03:41.360]  commies because the commies are gonna take your money and give it to their
[03:41.360 --> 03:47.200]  banker bosses and they're going to make you serve in national service and
[03:47.200 --> 03:51.080]  they're going to train you how to spy on your neighbors everything in Stalinist
[03:51.080 --> 03:56.520]  Russia study Stalinist Russia and then go and look at the government today and
[03:56.520 --> 04:00.840]  it's a carbon copy they're trying to face it in but running parallel to that
[04:00.840 --> 04:04.960]  is still the Bill of Rights Constitution free speech some private property
[04:04.960 --> 04:11.000]  with the government tax the rent you pay the property tax but they're trying to
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.800]  dissolve that it's like the movie the thing where it grabs you and starts to
[04:15.800 --> 04:21.120]  mimic you while it dissolves you so they're busy trying to turn us to Jello
[04:21.120 --> 04:25.360]  while they complete their program and we've got to man the pumps in the
[04:25.360 --> 04:31.160]  sinking ship of the Republic and prop it up because they want to sink it we've
[04:31.160 --> 04:35.920]  got to prop the Republic up while removing these parasites one by one at

[04:40.080 --> 04:44.520]  everything and their minions don't even know what they're following that's why
[04:44.520 --> 04:48.800]  you can actually deprogram them rather quickly if you're able to get through to
[04:48.800 --> 04:53.560]  the jellyfish drones and explain how they're dupes we'll be right back stay

[08:30.640 --> 08:39.920]  obama has now released his new 2012 slogan and that is forward which is of
[08:39.920 --> 08:47.680]  course the international not just socialist but marxist key word here's
[08:47.680 --> 08:54.840]  the washington times new obama slogan has long ties to marxism socialism and
[08:54.840 --> 08:59.520]  indeed it does the obama campaign apparently didn't look backwards into
[08:59.520 --> 09:06.120]  history when selecting its new campaign slogan forward a word with a long and
[09:06.120 --> 09:12.200]  rich association with European marxism no they they looked back when they did
[09:12.200 --> 09:16.040]  that victor morton writing for the washington times many communist and
[09:16.040 --> 09:20.720]  radical publications and entities throughout the 19th and 20th centuries
[09:20.720 --> 09:26.680]  had the name forward or its foreign derivatives wikipedia as an entire
[09:26.680 --> 09:33.000]  section on forward generic name for socialist publications name forward
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.640]  carries a special meaning in socialist political terminology it has been
[09:37.640 --> 09:41.280]  frequently used as a name for socialist communist and left-wing newspapers
[09:41.280 --> 09:46.000]  publications and the online and cycle pd explains the slogan forward reflects
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.120]  the conviction of European marxist and radicals that their movement reflects the
[09:51.120 --> 09:55.520]  march of history which would move forward past capitalism and socialism and
[09:55.520 --> 10:06.520]  communism and it goes on with the new obama slogan forward of course that
[10:06.520 --> 10:13.400]  itself is a cover communism is openly a tool of the mega banks in the last 150
[10:13.400 --> 10:17.960]  years on record marks and angles were financed to put it out and you notice
[10:17.960 --> 10:22.000]  the Federal Reserve promotes the communist manifesto and government
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.640]  public schools graduated income tax and go read the communist manifesto you're

[13:21.280 --> 13:24.400]  want to just tell you we grabbed those people and later it turned out I called

[13:28.880 --> 13:33.280]  it's for NATO g20 they take over and private security commands your police
[13:33.280 --> 13:37.440]  and military this is the globalist corporate fascist model when judicial
[13:37.440 --> 13:41.600]  watched suit it's such a key thing I talk about it weekly in 2007 to get the
[13:41.600 --> 13:47.000]  06 BAMP Canada documents it was the fortune 100 a little over a hundred
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.240]  corporations heads there and the heads of the executive cabinets of Canada the

[13:56.360 --> 14:03.360]  and first order of business was keep this secret next order was integration of
[14:03.360 --> 14:07.720]  North America by stealth using bio weapon attack threats natural flu threats
[14:07.720 --> 14:13.200]  economic collapse threats and al-qaeda terror threat threats and preparing the
[14:13.200 --> 14:17.680]  militaries to put down insurrection and resistance to the globalist takeover the
[14:17.680 --> 14:25.880]  three countries it was all right there and it was corporate chiefs at the
[14:25.880 --> 14:30.960]  meetings who ratified voted and then gave the orders to the government heads of
[14:30.960 --> 14:35.280]  the executive that's why Congress a year after that said hey we saw this
[14:35.280 --> 14:39.080]  BAMP document you're saying you're going to use Mexican and Canadian troops in
[14:39.080 --> 14:44.560]  the U.S. Congress needs to be told about that and the Pentagon said nope talk to
[14:44.560 --> 14:49.760]  the president we're operating under emergency declaration hey you got to get
[14:49.760 --> 14:53.560]  our authorization to go into Libya or Syria didn't I write secretary defense

[14:59.440 --> 15:04.400]  this country off and you just sit up there and act like you know for the time
[15:04.400 --> 15:08.640]  being there's a Congress the generals all smacked and had really airing it looks
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.960]  on their faces and just got off on it like a gang of crooks I watched that
[15:13.960 --> 15:18.720]  body language oh man that makes me mad it's like I watched the body language of
[15:18.720 --> 15:23.720]  these Hercules team and and and federally trained local police they put full
[15:23.720 --> 15:28.320]  schemas gone without even helmets and just sit there bugging their eyes out
[15:28.320 --> 15:31.800]  everybody trying to intimidate everybody and then later memos came out they are
[15:31.800 --> 15:36.400]  let me give you a little memo it doesn't intimidate anybody folks are
[15:36.400 --> 15:40.720]  digging in getting their weapons ready nobody's going to your FEMA camp let me
[15:40.720 --> 15:46.400]  just give you a little newsflash on that you have miscalculated you think we're
[15:46.400 --> 15:51.920]  afraid now the American people are not afraid they're very very sad they're
[15:51.920 --> 15:56.080]  very very sad and they don't take any pleasure and what's going to happen to
[15:56.080 --> 16:01.200]  you when you do what your bosses tell you to do it's not fun just what we've
[16:01.200 --> 16:05.800]  got to do we've got to defend our families if you offensively try to come to
[16:05.800 --> 16:13.960]  lock us up and take us in your torture wagons to your dungeons you have
[16:13.960 --> 16:20.280]  forsaken your republic a lot of you have a lot of you have reached out I talked
[16:20.280 --> 16:23.640]  a lot of police and military and the majority of the military is away but
[16:23.640 --> 16:31.640]  they've hired a lot of thugs as well and I've likened it to going out if people
[16:31.640 --> 16:37.160]  have to defend themselves against you there's no victory in it it's like
[16:37.160 --> 16:44.480]  running out and stomping on dog droppings it just gets on your shoe I mean
[16:44.480 --> 16:49.040]  it doesn't do anything the new order sits offshore well we all have a big war
[16:49.040 --> 16:57.800]  and kill each other it's just it's the height of twisted sadistic folly that by
[16:57.800 --> 17:04.800]  increment villa rights and constitution is basically burned to a crisp and the
[17:04.800 --> 17:10.880]  martial law system is openly being implemented and every time there's a
[17:10.880 --> 17:15.800]  globalist meeting they take over the city ban free speech no one even resist
[17:15.800 --> 17:19.280]  them and then they'll send police out with police dogs like g20 we have footage
[17:19.280 --> 17:25.200]  of it and these women come out of a shop with bags and the police release dogs
[17:25.200 --> 17:32.160]  and they start biting the women I mean these guys it's like they're a hunter
[17:32.160 --> 17:35.800]  you take hunting for the first time he's got buck fever and a cow is walking
[17:35.800 --> 17:39.720]  through the brush this happens a lot and the and I've talked to people that
[17:39.720 --> 17:42.000]  have actually witnessed and people like don't shoot that's a cow they're like
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.720]  no I want to and they shoot the cow or they shoot other hunters and it's the
[17:46.720 --> 17:50.640]  same thing I mean it's one thing to be carrying out tyranny and violating the
[17:50.640 --> 17:53.640]  First Amendment telling people in Pittsburgh for two days they couldn't
[17:53.640 --> 17:57.200]  be on the streets and selectively enforcing it and we got footage and
[17:57.200 --> 18:00.000]  uncovered it where they go through neighborhoods with armored vehicles
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.400]  saying you're not allowed to be on the streets and there would be kids out
[18:03.400 --> 18:07.520]  front playing basketball and football and they would hit them with sound
[18:07.520 --> 18:14.160]  cannons I'm talking about ten-year-old kids driving around in neighborhoods and
[18:14.160 --> 18:17.480]  then no one was resisting that they go well we got to attack somebody we got
[18:17.480 --> 18:23.480]  to get the boys a taste of blood got to train them on their own people okay the
[18:23.480 --> 18:29.640]  university five miles outside of the g20 area they always congregate gate there
[18:29.640 --> 18:34.080]  the students you know they're out there eating hamburgers and stuff and
[18:34.080 --> 18:38.120]  studying out in the park so let's go attack them so they showed up they
[18:38.120 --> 18:41.440]  blocked all the exits they said leave people couldn't leave and there's just
[18:41.440 --> 18:45.440]  every angle of Billy clubbing women and men in the head people on bikes trying
[18:45.440 --> 18:48.680]  to get away and and the cops don't have to knock a woman off a bike in the
[18:48.680 --> 18:51.880]  Billy club or a couple more times while you're wearing some Darth Vader outfit
[18:51.880 --> 18:55.800]  and they put these guys in these masks and these outfits so they can just be
[18:55.800 --> 18:59.560]  these little psychos and a lot of psychos do that they wear a clown mask or a
[18:59.560 --> 19:04.200]  demon mask I mean it's all part of the psychology that role of little Darth
[19:04.200 --> 19:10.560]  Vader's they step into and I just watched the footage I had guys there and I
[19:10.560 --> 19:15.200]  just watch police you know a woman's on a bicycle see a run-up and hit her in the
[19:15.200 --> 19:18.800]  head and she cries and she falls down and then you come over and club or a
[19:18.800 --> 19:24.720]  couple more times and then they say hey that's the good guys you're not you're
[19:24.720 --> 19:31.000]  you know you hate police if you don't like watching a woman me Billy club maybe
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.920]  we should have a competition for the new American flag will it be a woman me and
[19:34.920 --> 19:40.640]  Billy club maybe a kid getting their hedge blown off or maybe just a child
[19:40.640 --> 19:45.360]  being grope by a potbellied TSA agent I mean maybe that's maybe that video of
[19:45.360 --> 19:50.560]  the baby having diaper taken off by the man and the woman at the TSA maybe
[19:50.560 --> 19:56.080]  that's the new American flag all right we're gonna come back and get into all
[19:56.080 --> 20:00.280]  the other martial law news as they just slowly turn the heat up on the dead

[24:22.960 --> 24:27.360]  the Republican leadership agrees with them Obama informations are confronted
[24:27.360 --> 24:32.080]  over ban conspiracy theories paper we're gonna play this video later and the
[24:32.080 --> 24:37.200]  great folks that we are change got the confrontation claims to have no memory of
[24:37.200 --> 24:42.760]  saying speech should be taxed even though he put out official papers and again
[24:42.760 --> 24:47.440]  that's always the rule lie to the enemy but then we actually have video of him
[24:47.440 --> 24:52.360]  saying ban the second amendment that you have no individual right and who does
[24:52.360 --> 24:56.960]  Obama say he's going to nominate because another Supreme Court justice is set to
[24:56.960 --> 25:04.720]  be stepping down the next year he says he wants Cass Sunstein a guy who wrote
[25:04.720 --> 25:12.480]  two papers saying ban arrest tax people's free speech we have links to that in
[25:12.480 --> 25:22.680]  the article now on the Marshall law front when the TSA is all over the
[25:22.680 --> 25:27.360]  country in major cities now and randomly walks up to you and wants to search
[25:27.360 --> 25:37.160]  your bag first airplanes then outside the airport then bus terminals then
[25:37.160 --> 25:42.320]  train stations and then now on highways at armored mobile checkpoints and at
[25:42.320 --> 25:47.880]  football games it's everywhere even high school football games and the TSA
[25:47.880 --> 25:52.800]  comes and trains the local police to say they're allowed to grab your genitals
[25:52.800 --> 25:56.720]  or private security take the federal case in New Mexico federal judge said
[25:56.720 --> 26:02.880]  they're allowed to squeeze the genitals in Albuquerque no it was Santa Fe last
[26:02.880 --> 26:11.120]  year if TSA comes it does the training see it's a magic wand of abuse oh there's
[26:11.120 --> 26:14.640]  no fourth amendment there's no 10th amendment we can be out of federal
[26:14.640 --> 26:18.040]  jurisdiction we're not even sworn officers anyways we can do what the FBI
[26:18.040 --> 26:26.400]  could never do because we said so magic we're the civil emergency goons we're
[26:26.400 --> 26:30.800]  the brown shirts and here it is fully armed US troops patrol Minnesota
[26:30.800 --> 26:37.560]  neighborhood guard members previously hunted insurgents in Iraq we have that
[26:37.560 --> 26:43.360]  report and photos and then martial law red zone in America heavily armed
[26:43.360 --> 26:48.240]  security teams to patrol Chicago feds prepare for mass detentions evacuations
[26:48.240 --> 26:56.920]  planned underway and it goes on pat downs everywhere on the streets and then
[26:56.920 --> 27:01.880]  I've got more reports on that front but wait there's a problem Kentucky Supreme
[27:01.880 --> 27:06.840]  Court rules highway checkpoints illegal just like my Supreme Court rule it's
[27:06.840 --> 27:11.880]  very clear that matter they have random checkpoints now for drunk driving oh
[27:11.880 --> 27:18.400]  you're against drunks aren't you well you've always got an excuse don't you the
[27:18.400 --> 27:22.040]  point is you can get drugs for reckless driving there were already laws there
[27:22.040 --> 27:27.400]  throw the book on when you see the reckless driving but no mothers against
[27:27.400 --> 27:33.600]  drunk driving says get rid of our Bella writes so how is the TSA doing this when
[27:33.600 --> 27:38.440]  the Kentucky police and others are doing something illegal they have to stop
[27:38.440 --> 27:43.360]  why can the TSA do it now we're gonna go to break here in the next long segment
[27:43.360 --> 27:49.760]  coming up I'm gonna play a clip from my film police state 2000 first and a new
[27:49.760 --> 27:57.520]  clip from police state for the rise of FEMA because I want to show you that what
[27:57.520 --> 28:02.960]  the military's been training for in this country and what the military has been
[28:02.960 --> 28:09.200]  setting up in this nation is being taught at military bases and in joint
[28:09.200 --> 28:16.160]  drills is being taught to our police so the audio in the video if you're
[28:16.160 --> 28:20.560]  watching on prison planet TV if not you can skip to an hour 40 minutes into my
[28:20.560 --> 28:25.480]  film police state 2000 that by the way is free online and also by the DVD if you
[28:25.480 --> 28:28.880]  want to support us in infowars.com and see in higher quality but the point is
[28:28.880 --> 28:34.560]  at a hour 40 into it exactly it starts the attention attention attention
[28:34.560 --> 28:38.880]  American forces are here to help remain calm we will not tolerate civil
[28:38.880 --> 28:43.360]  disobedience and then I got the footage of the urban warfare training they're
[28:43.360 --> 28:48.760]  practicing to put people in a camp and admitting that you will be disarmed your
[28:48.760 --> 28:52.360]  children will be taken from you and put into another area of the camp whether
[28:52.360 --> 28:56.720]  it's during a depression collapse where people can't take care of themselves or
[28:56.720 --> 29:02.720]  whether it's after a staged a bomb or dirty bomb goes off or God forbid a new
[29:02.720 --> 29:08.440]  9-11 it's all about getting you dependent and we've got these
[29:08.440 --> 29:14.400]  unbelievably naked tyrants like Cass Sunstein who wrote public papers for
[29:14.400 --> 29:19.680]  Chicago Business School and for Harvard right before he was put in as the
[29:19.680 --> 29:23.400]  regulations are and Obama in this article is set to try to make him the
[29:23.400 --> 29:27.000]  new Supreme Court Justice and let me tell you he gets before the Republicans
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.680]  in the Senate and and the Democrats and they hear he hates free speech he's
[29:30.680 --> 29:34.240]  going right it might be the head of the court I'll be the Supreme Court you know
[29:34.240 --> 29:38.360]  justice head justice or something I mean like what you're against freedom you
[29:38.360 --> 29:42.320]  hate America you hate we're gonna have to make you Supreme Court you know
[29:42.320 --> 29:46.920]  justice immediately but how about Chief Justice you say arrest people for their

[38:39.840 --> 38:43.240]  and of course none of the Navy SEALs that know what happened are alive a
[38:43.240 --> 38:47.680]  helicopter that they loaded on witnesses saw blew up with whoever it was they
[38:47.680 --> 38:53.080]  supposedly went in there one year ago today on May Day again international
[38:53.080 --> 38:58.360]  communist day before that Illuminati day before that druidic high holy sacrifice
[38:58.360 --> 39:07.000]  day the returning of the Sun yeah Daily Mail you name it reporting it up at
[39:07.000 --> 39:13.640]  info wars.com SEALs slam Obama for using them as ammunition in a bid to take
[39:13.640 --> 39:17.200]  credit for bin Laden killing during election campaign let me see the guys
[39:17.200 --> 39:21.400]  that loaded on the helicopter actually went in there that helicopter blew up
[39:21.400 --> 39:25.840]  we're told it was a you know a stealth helicopter that just crashed it was no

[39:30.360 --> 39:38.840]  Laden killing and then we were told that it was SEAL Team 6 pack 20 plus of them
[39:38.840 --> 39:42.520]  on a helicopter sent out to save Rangers turned out that wasn't true
[39:42.520 --> 39:47.760]  helicopter just blew up and again the SEALs do think Obama was on board it was
[39:47.760 --> 39:51.560]  a setup do you think Al Qaeda got on the base you know the same Al Qaeda that the
[39:51.560 --> 39:55.640]  New World Order controls in Libya just got on there and put the bomb on and
[39:55.640 --> 39:59.200]  yeah some of the SEALs think it was Obama but most of them just think Al Qaeda
[39:59.200 --> 40:03.240]  got a bomb on there but it is suspicious that they were all put on there and
[40:03.240 --> 40:07.320]  sent out on a fake mission it blew up think Al Qaeda did that too and put out
[40:07.320 --> 40:11.840]  the fake Ranger story you think Al Qaeda killed Pat Tillman no we know the

[45:05.200 --> 45:08.920]  and just absolutely demonize the system is because the system is rotten at the
[45:08.920 --> 45:12.760]  top and we need to recognize it it's like when you eat bad food and it's food
[45:12.760 --> 45:16.540]  poisoning you will vomit it up when you start getting sick your body's like get
[45:16.540 --> 45:22.200]  this out get it out and it starts coming out both ends that's your body

[46:12.360 --> 46:19.480]  of this has gotten I mean I look at the news in front of me it's all off the
[46:19.480 --> 46:24.480]  charts and I got a piece later I'll play with Joel Scowles and if we have time
[46:24.480 --> 46:29.800]  it's an AP piece on the US troops now fully invading Uganda to get Joseph
[46:29.800 --> 46:32.720]  Coney and if you even hear of the head general because he knows it's so ridiculous
[46:32.720 --> 46:38.080]  because this will be seen on television in Uganda he goes he has not been seen
[46:38.080 --> 46:45.440]  in years but in five years maybe he come back if we don't do this people are
[46:45.440 --> 46:49.480]  like oh the special forces can't find him it's the perfect boogeyman oh we're
[46:49.480 --> 46:52.280]  taking your rights and gonna have a checkpoint and train your neighbor to
[46:52.280 --> 46:55.880]  spy on you because the bin Laden really this training manual says it's for gun
[46:55.880 --> 47:00.240]  owners and libertarians and returning veterans of the enemy oh yeah well
[47:00.240 --> 47:04.920]  that's the new threat but but bin Laden it's like oh african's invading all
[47:04.920 --> 47:08.200]  these countries and taking over bank accounts and shutting things down and
[47:08.200 --> 47:12.080]  you know and and and going after people militarily because of Coney really well
[47:12.080 --> 47:16.120]  he's been dead for six years it doesn't matter he's scary though he's a bad guy
[47:16.120 --> 47:21.560]  all a big PR rollout with Coney 2012 State Department funded we told you
[47:21.560 --> 47:27.320]  they do it and here we are ten years after 9-11 and it's like give all your
[47:27.320 --> 47:31.320]  rights up bin Laden hit us and the whole story is a complete fraud and then now
[47:31.320 --> 47:36.160]  they tell us oh the war on terror is over with al-qaeda it's now the American
[47:36.160 --> 47:40.840]  people why there's terrorists everywhere well who are they and all the
[47:40.840 --> 47:44.080]  manuals well they talk about freedom they talk about land rights they talk
[47:44.080 --> 47:48.200]  about a gen 21 they make frequent references the u.s. Constitution I'm
[47:48.200 --> 47:52.400]  giving you direct quotes out of the FBI training manuals for the police they
[47:52.400 --> 47:56.120]  got get us out of the u.n. stickers and Ron Paul stickers they give out Alex
[47:56.120 --> 47:59.880]  Jones and Aaron Russo videos and they say the federal government's been taken
[47:59.880 --> 48:03.080]  over and wants to enslave us in fact guys I forgot I didn't I am it to you
[48:03.080 --> 48:06.400]  because I'm in so many newspapers I always forget to even post it on our
[48:06.400 --> 48:13.360]  own site Huffington Post demonizes us as well as Michigan live you know the
[48:13.360 --> 48:20.680]  biggest website in Michigan was that Detroit Press or whatever and a bunch
[48:20.680 --> 48:25.320]  of others that Alex Jones listeners are putting up flyers all over Michigan
[48:25.320 --> 48:32.240]  that say Obama is like Hitler well he is in that in DAA secret arrest of
[48:32.240 --> 48:37.120]  Americans the police state and it says in DAA secret arrest for Americans
[48:37.120 --> 48:42.360]  torture wars and and it shows the flyer with Obama with the cover of the
[48:42.360 --> 48:48.640]  Obama deception and on the other side of swastika and then explains great idea
[48:48.640 --> 48:51.720]  everybody should do that we should make a flyer like that because the media comes
[48:51.720 --> 48:57.960]  out and says how dare them a new low for Jones and and the police of
[48:57.960 --> 49:02.160]  course want to find out who's doing it implying it's illegal oh my gosh you
[49:02.160 --> 49:07.360]  would do this about and they in one article it says the conspiracy theories

[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:55.600]  oh sir I'm from South Texas I'm wanting to know what can I tell my father for
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.200]  because he's a police officer in rounds of Texas I just want to know what I can
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:06.640]  tell my father to have convinced him that this thing was getting bad and I want
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.120]  to help out the other police officers to get them informed about what's going on
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:15.080]  well if you live out in a country area it's not going to get that bad
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.040]  immediately because the globalists are busy taking over the cities and everybody
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:23.040]  trained but he just needs to understand the Bill of Rights Constitution I would
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:29.240]  give him my films or give him links to him online something like police state
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:32.720]  for the rise of FEMA a lot of cops see the name and think it means they're bad
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.400]  no a lot of countries have police but don't have a police state you know it's
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.000]  like everybody knows the North Korean police are bad we don't want to be like
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.840]  them but I can't tell you how many cops you know say how dare you make a film
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.640]  called police state it's just that total level of ignorance where you're not
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:53.640]  even supposed to say hey the police are supposed to you know be under certain
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:57.240]  constraints that's what the founding fathers said but I have as much
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:02.400]  criticism for the general public or more the effect a lot of police if they're
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.480]  not bullies actually are more awake the general public because they live more in
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:11.400]  in more the real world than the general thumb-sucking childlike public that's
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.520]  why the military out of any group is the most awake is the best people but
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:19.720]  they've also got the out of control thugs like the ones that told me they
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:23.560]  were gonna you know attack me if I didn't stop filming them in New York
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:29.720]  City but most military isn't like that these were low-level idiots and it
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.880]  seems like the system puts them in certain pockets and it's those types
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:38.280]  they put on the streets to go out and intimidate people so I don't know what
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:44.400]  else I can say about that but I mean I would look your dad's got to know that
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.800]  the feds are out of their jurisdiction does your dad know about the TSA
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:53.160]  threatening to militarily blockade Texas if the state didn't let TSA group
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.600]  children and they threatened military action that's like the Civil War or
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:02.040]  something I mean it's amazing does your dad know all over Texas now the feds
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.760]  are out of their jurisdiction or not even they're not even federal police
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:09.920]  they're not even sworn or bonded that are now running checkpoints I mean your
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:14.640]  dad's got to know that we're not in Kansas anymore or he's so busy you know
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.120]  going to domestic disputes or whatever and you know dealing with the
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:23.960]  degeneration of society he may not know you know what's going on I mean do you
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:28.560]  live in a big town it's bronzel Texas it's the city right next to
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:33.080]  Montemore well I mean he sees Mexico collapsing from government corruption so
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:36.480]  I mean you know that's a really tough job down there that's one of the most
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.880]  dangerous places in the US so he's probably got his hands full to be
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:42.640]  worried about you know what's going on other areas I mean what do you think
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:48.080]  your dad's doing well he's just doing his job but the thing is I'm trying to
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:53.960]  get him to know everything like the last dad the operation last dance and like
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.080]  the Gulf of Tonkin in today I'm trying to let him know of all the stuff that's

[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:07.040]  and furious it's on record they shipped the guns in to blame the Second
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:10.800]  Amendment so that's a false flag right there that's a way to wake your dad up
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.640]  get here he knows that oh so is that open the door where he's actually listening

[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:24.840]  permission but he's like this is this is too crazy and and he's like what do you

[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:49.320]  promised not to spike the football and use it so when he promised oh you knew
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:54.760]  that be a lie he says zig you zag he says up you go down he says left you go
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:09:01.320]  right in zigzag you do he makes Bill Clinton look truthful so it's fitting

[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:12.760]  is all coming out we got some good news Arizona bill with ban you in a 21 within
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:16.080]  the state and other states passed it as well I'll just Arizona looking at
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:21.720]  passing him misguided mayday occupied Wall Street plans to shut down America
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:29.040]  and again on Mayday they're all over the country maydays the communist day the
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.800]  globalists put out a big call for Occupy Wall Street against white White House
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:40.160]  and corruption on Wall Street a diverse group comes out and then the media
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.920]  gives it all this hype and then they were unable to fully take it over so the
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:48.320]  White House ordered everybody arrested and 30 plus coordinated raids and media
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:52.680]  demonization began now they're trying to rebrand it as communist and give it
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:57.360]  George Soros funding again but they've been unable to co-opt it so that's why
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:01.640]  I've praised Occupy Wall Street while criticizing it because it's a diverse
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:08.000]  thing more on that coming up we also have some economic news we're going to be
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:15.600]  hitting on but I want to bring to the airwaves for his maiden voyage with us a
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:21.360]  guy I've followed the last few years Dr. Peter Glidden BS ND naturopathic
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:25.720]  doctor he received his BS degree from the University of Massachusetts and Amherst
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:31.320]  he earned his ND from Bay Star University in Seattle Washington he's an
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:35.480]  outspoken advocate of holistic health more than two decades he's been treating
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:39.960]  people with naturopathic therapeutics including homeopathy heavy metal
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:44.840]  chelation herbal medicine bio identical hormone supplementation which is
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:48.760]  really starting to supplant establishment Western medicine I should add so
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:53.160]  they're coming after it everywhere they're trying to tell the local pharmacies
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:56.080]  like people's pharmacy and stuff here locally they're doing the same thing
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:59.400]  that are becoming so popular oh you can't do that anymore oh this
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:03.240]  hormonal therapy that's saving women losing their babies and this oh you
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:06.680]  can't have that anymore I mean it's oh you can't have fish oil oh you can't have
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:10.720]  vitamin C that's already happening in Europe so he's here I wanted to get him
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:16.320]  on because he's an expert on what this modern Western medicine is and that's
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.520]  even changing because when you break your leg nothing better than Western
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:23.440]  medicine or if you've got to get a heart bypass and didn't do the things you
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:27.880]  needed to have a healthy heart yeah it works antibiotics are great until they're
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:33.880]  overused and causes flesh eating bacteria but the point is that now even
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.560]  old-fashioned Western medicine is being taken over by big pharma with these
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:41.000]  computerized systems under national health care where they tell and I've
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.400]  had medical doctors on they tell you what you can do now so now it's pure
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:50.560]  eugenics big pharma medicine so they've taken the the good parts of Western
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:54.720]  medicine they're trying to phase those out and bring in this Rockefeller type
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:00.280]  medicine this eugenical medicine and so we're gonna go over the history of how
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:07.600]  we got here with our guest Peter Glidden dr. Peter Glidden joins us via
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.960]  video Skype thank you so much for spending time with us I know this will
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:14.880]  be the first of probably many interviews thank you for your your fine work and
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:17.840]  I've been aware of your work the last few years but as I get more and more into
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.360]  this and lose 40 plus pounds without even trying by simply getting the minerals
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:25.840]  and things I need and as I you know really try to get back you know to
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:29.880]  being healthy just more and more your name comes so highly recommended across
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:34.760]  the spectrum so we're honored to have you dr. Glidden very kind of you Alex
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:38.760]  such a pleasure to be here I'm you know that that goes both ways I've been a
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:43.600]  big fan of prison planet for a number of years so it's it's really great for me
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:47.120]  to be here thanks so much for the opportunity let's say we're talking to
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:50.040]  layman out there like myself who are just starting to learn about this how did
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:56.920]  we get here give us the history well in the early 1900s certainly the 1800s and
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:01.200]  the early 1900s the playing field of medicine was very different than it is
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.080]  now you know back in the day you had the homey a path you had the chiropractors
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:10.080]  you had the nature paths you had the osteopaths you had the herbalists and
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:15.640]  you had the MDs and by the way MDs do not practice medicine MDs practice a
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:20.400]  particular type of medicine called allopathic medicine right I'm a nature
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:24.280]  a path I practice nature pathic medicine there's homey a pathic medicine
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:29.400]  osteopathic medicine chiropractic medicine will guess what the MDs practice
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:34.120]  allopathic medicine I'll tell you what that is in a second but in the early
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.920]  1900s the playing field in medicine was relatively level here and nobody had the
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:43.320]  upper hand there were turf wars kind of like you know in the movie gangs in New
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:47.440]  York right it wasn't the prettiest of all things but you know nobody had the
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:53.200]  upper hand until 1910 when the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie's it
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.600]  was actually the Carnegie's that supported this it was something called
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:01.240]  the Flexner report the Carnegie's hired this guy named Abraham Flexner he went
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:05.640]  all around the United States now remember this was before the interstate
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:10.200]  highway system right so Flexner five years before the internet took him five
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:14.520]  years you went all around the country on horseback and stagecoach and train and
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:19.720]  he did an inventory of all of the medical schools and all of the hospitals in
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:25.360]  the US that practiced MD directed allopathic pharmaceutical medicine
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:29.280]  brought the list back to the Carnegie's which is famously referred to
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:34.720]  historically as the Flexner report and the Carnegie's and then the Rockefellers
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:40.840]  proceeded to give a millions millions of dollars of free money to the medical
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:46.440]  schools and the hospitals that prescribe drugs why because the Carnegie's and
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:50.480]  the Rockefellers were deeply in bed with pharmaceutical companies so guess
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:54.960]  what if you're starting a business and I'm starting a business and you get a
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:58.880]  million bucks of free money and I don't well guess who's gonna have the bigger
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:04.560]  business you will this is why the MDs are in the driver's seat of medicine
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:08.360]  now it is not because their therapeutics are more effective it is not
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:11.880]  because their therapeutics are more scientific and it certainly isn't
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.560]  because their therapeutics are safer it's because of financial coalitions that
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:20.400]  were built at the turn of the century between the pharmaceutical industry and
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:25.080]  medicine and everybody has forgotten about it we look out of our windows
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:29.440]  today and we see son of a gun the only medicine that they make TV shows and
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:33.680]  movies about is MD directed medicine the only medicine that's practiced at my
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.120]  hospital is MD directed medicine the only medicine my insurance pays for is MD
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:43.240]  directed medicine therefore we unconsciously assume that the medicine
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:49.080]  that the MDs practice must be the best well guess what it's not they are in the
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:53.520]  driver's seat only because of financial and political coalitions that were
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:58.760]  built at the turn of the century that have turned into a gigantic out of
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:04.760]  control monopolistic juggernaut and we are dropping like flies because of it
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:10.800]  but don't get me started amazing and again notice I called it Rockefeller
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:15.800]  medicine for people that don't know the cancer industry everything the takeover
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:20.840]  of hospitals phasing out charity in medicine that had always been demanded
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:25.040]  the Hippocratic oath that 20 years ago they phased that out and now they're
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:30.280]  bringing in the death panels now we're seeing Carnegie Rockefeller all of them
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:35.240]  who were eugenicists we're seeing its death care so they're they're even phasing
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:40.360]  out what was good that came out of the whole MD line and and and trying to turn
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:45.800]  it into pure evil now and we go back to them being known as the monopoly men
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:51.520]  they had already created all the monopolies over oil steel railroads now
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:55.920]  they're bringing the monopoly of medicine but I noticed in studies the
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:01.000]  elites British royalty Dutch royalty they all go to the herbalist in the
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.800]  natural path they all actually go to the other schools they know something
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:10.920]  don't they well it's interesting you should say that because old man
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:15.680]  Rockefeller ahead of you know he kept a personal physician a homie path as his
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:20.000]  personal physician which is quite ironic when you think about it yeah so you know
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.280]  really listen Alex the only reason that my profession you think we have a free
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:29.120]  medical market here in the United States think again here's the deal as a
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.560]  licensed naturopathic physician here's what I had to do to become a naturopath
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:36.600]  four years pre-med four years naturopathic medical school a thousand
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:39.920]  hours of clinical supervision I had to pass national boards and state boards
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:44.680]  through 25 hours of continuing education credit in Seattle Washington as a
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:49.840]  licensed naturopathic physician I can deliver babies prescribe drugs order
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:54.000]  any diagnostic tests I want work in hospitals legally refer to myself as a
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.920]  physician and it's all paid for by insurance if I was to do exactly exactly
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.920]  the same thing in Chicago that I did in Seattle I'd be thrown in jail for a
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:10.120]  year and find $5,000 for practicing medicine without a license and that's
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:15.320]  just not right we do not have a free medical market in the United States it
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:20.600]  has been completely monopolized by the MDs for the last hundred years and you
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:27.160]  know you're right that the MDs are really excellent at trauma care and some
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:30.560]  type of infections you know if you have a bullet in your leg you get your leg
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.760]  blown off in Iraq you have a nasty pneumonia that botanical medicine
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:38.960]  couldn't fix you break your leg skin you know somebody T bones you at the
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:43.640]  intersection they are good at that but that is the only thing that allopathic
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:47.440]  medicine is good at the reason that we have a health care crisis in this
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:51.680]  country the reason that bankruptcy the leading cause of bankruptcy is medical
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.440]  bills the reason that our health is getting worse and worse and chronic
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:00.920]  diseases getting more and more is because MD directed allopathic
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:07.760]  reductionistic pharmaceutical medicine for chronic disease does not work it
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:12.480]  doesn't work and dr. Wallach and I are the only one standing up on this hill
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:17.440]  and saying it yeah look you wouldn't take a chihuahua duck hunting right you
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:21.800]  need a Labrador retriever for that you wouldn't take a chihuahua to find a lost
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:26.960]  kid in the wilderness need a bloodhound for that well taking your body to an MD
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:32.960]  bless their hearts for a chronic illness is a fool's errand well you know
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:38.280]  dr. Blalox is a renowned brain surgeon he basically says the same thing you're
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:43.520]  saying too well that you know the truth is a funny thing right it's hard to
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:47.160]  suppress the truth it is stay right there we're gonna come back and get more
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:51.040]  into this history and now where things are going you're trying to really take
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:58.440]  over now stay with us a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:02.160]  into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:06.720]  and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:09.760]  grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:14.760]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:19.480]  trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and

[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:12.800]  Dr. Peter Glidden is our guest I know we've got callers holding from the last
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:17.760]  hour on other issues but I think we probably need to unfortunately let
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:22.240]  those callers go and open the phones up so we can take some questions for Dr.
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:28.400]  Glidden coming up here in this talk we're doing but continue with the history
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.800]  of this because now it's out in the open Bill Gates who's heavily invested in
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:37.000]  all this eugenics the Rockefeller Foundation that he's teamed up with all
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.640]  of them he comes out and says I can play the clip we played it probably 30 times
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:44.320]  people are like no don't play it again we've heard it just type in if you want
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:49.440]  to see it folks Bill Gates endorses death panels there's a couple clips but he
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:54.400]  says hey kill grandma don't give her care the last year of her life just decide
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:59.280]  she's dead kill grandma and that's a death panel folks he says that and we can
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:03.880]  hire 10 teachers and the teachers all start clapping so this idea that now the
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:10.160]  government run by the issue Genesis and big pharma now directs through the
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:15.560]  computer systems in the healthcare what you can be given and in England you've
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:21.160]  got to go to the National Health Service to even get permission from them to go
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:24.800]  see a private doctor and Paul Watson for a month couldn't even get into see him
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:29.000]  with a chest cult and you know was having to try some natural remedies and
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.640]  things that did help but now they want to block you being able to get masses
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:38.480]  massive dosages of vitamin C or take trace minerals on top of regular
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:42.840]  minerals and they say oh you need a very small dose they want us sick in fact I've
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:47.280]  seen those studies doc where the most unhealthy food in America is served in
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:52.600]  hospitals and just everything they do is about what we take breast cancer it's
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:56.920]  it's race for the cure why don't we try to find out why there's almost a 3,000
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.200]  percentage increase in breast cancer and why the US has the worst level in the
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:06.000]  world well you know how about race for the cause doc well that's what we should
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.040]  absolutely 100% do and you're right on the money here Alex because here's the
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:15.160]  thing and we are deeply embedded in this matrix right every culture has a myth
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:19.080]  and it's built into the to the fabric of society now years ago everybody was
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.560]  convinced that the earth was flat right and everybody was wrong after that
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:26.080]  everybody was convinced the earth was at the center of the solar system and
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:30.040]  you know everybody was wrong the myth that the prevailing myth that we have
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:34.760]  right now and it is a deeply embedded myth in this cut in this culture is that
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:41.160]  MD directed medicine equals medicine and everybody else is the back of the bus
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:46.880]  quack it's just not true the type of medicine that the MDs are trained in is
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:53.240]  one particular philosophy one particular subset aspect of the medicine in
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:59.200]  general and it is horrible it delivers horrible results for chronic illness I
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:04.000]  give you a perfect example my colleague dr. Wallach sued the FDA eight times he
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.440]  had to sue the FDA in order to secure something called a certified health
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:13.440]  claim we had to sue the food and drug administration so I can say what I'm
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:19.880]  about to say legally without being thrown in jail you ready 200 micrograms of
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:26.200]  selenium 200 micrograms it's a teeny weenie amount of the mineral selenium
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:33.360]  reduces the occurrence of breast cancer 82% reduces the occurrence of breast
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:37.760]  cancer by 82% it reduces the occurrence of colon cancer reduces the occurrence of
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:41.600]  lung cancer and it reduces the occurrence of colorectal cancer as well
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:48.080]  selenium a simple mineral supplement 82% why aren't the Susan g common women
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.440]  marching for that because they don't know it why don't they know it because
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:55.880]  medicine in the United States is completely controlled by the MDs the
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:00.080]  MDs are completely controlled by the pharmaceutical company and nobody knows
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:07.320]  that there do in fact exist science-based clinically verified alternatives for
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:11.920]  type 2 diabetes high blood pressure osteoporosis are you know dr. Glenn let me
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:15.080]  stop me stop because we're gonna come back from breaking it into that and
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:19.600]  every time I've had you you know folks on from young Jevity people like dr.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.600]  Wallach on I forget and and he never toots his horn that he's beaten the
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:28.440]  government all these times one of the only people because he can really prove
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:34.960]  it that is so amazing and that they do know all of this the system knows they
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:39.200]  know Prozac's gonna make why people commit suicide they know aspartame eats
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:44.400]  holes in your brains they know all this this is cold-blooded that's correct it's
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:48.720]  100% cold-blooded and one of the worst things anybody can do with a chronic
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:52.160]  health condition is visit an MD it is one of the worst things that you can do
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:59.880]  that's why my radio show on the GCN network is called fire your MD now well
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:03.320]  very well said and I'm glad that you're out there speaking out and exposing
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:09.360]  these people I want to get into the eight times you guys have sued the FDA and
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:13.160]  all the times you've won and and and each point you sued on let's get into
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:17.040]  that when we come back because I've got to get Wallach back on he had been on
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:21.840]  like a year and point out that wow he never even toots his horn that he's
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.360]  done that with your help and others because this is being proven and that's
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:30.120]  why they're so desperate to suppress the type of information that we break down
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:35.880]  at info wars team dot com so we'll talk about the fact that so many illnesses
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:41.880]  are chronic lack of key nutrients and the system knows this that's why they

[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:05.000]  a decision is being made by the president and the joint chiefs in the war room
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.400]  with the pentagon and when they realized there was no possibility of
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:13.880]  recalling the wing will be only one course of action over
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:20.440]  total commitment. Andrew you recall what Clemens once said about war
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:25.320]  I know I didn't think I knew that he said war was too important to be left to the
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:30.600]  generals when he said that 50 years ago he might have been
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:36.600]  alright but today war is too important to be left to politicians
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:42.520]  they have neither the time the training or the inclination for strategic
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:48.600]  thought resistance to tyrants is obedience to god
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:54.200]  it's alex jones
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:59.320]  we are back live the first of many interviews with dr glidden we've got
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:04.280]  folks calling in like marshal in oklahoma listening on xm channel 166
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:08.440]  but i want to get to your calls i want to cover some more of this ground
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:14.680]  listen i had tried vitamins minerals i had
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:18.600]  exercised i'd tried to starve myself and because for
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:23.000]  six seven eight years i didn't work out and gained like 50 60 pounds
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.560]  i could not get it off and my stomach would hurt i would be so
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:32.360]  hungry and i would and i could just pig out
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:37.800]  and it just would not satisfy me now i can eat about half of what i used to
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:43.000]  eat i've lost over 40 pounds and i mean i had a
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.280]  chicken fried steak two nights ago and i'm still losing weight it slowed down
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:50.120]  but it you could see the transformation
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:55.240]  and now if i just diet a little bit i know it's all going to fall off so i'm
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:58.120]  about to go into that phase but this has been done without dieting i just have
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:01.640]  not been hungry with beyond tangy tangerine

[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:39.320]  completely sold because they were immediately like well let's have some

[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:03.480]  media she wants to do a testimonial uh the guy
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:07.400]  that we use as a handyman uh listens to the show and
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.960]  got some and has lost 30 something pounds in a month and a half and it's like
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:14.040]  this is magic it's not magic even the mainline

[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:20.600]  this does beyond tangy tangerine available at infoworseteam.com and i
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.880]  didn't get dr glidden on the plug but it's a catch 22
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:28.360]  he starts talking about what is amazing in their lawsuits and i
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:32.360]  forget they've done this in one this is a big secret
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:35.080]  and it does support our broadcast and what we do but
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:38.760]  i mean all over the years i've turned down hundreds of sponsors
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:42.520]  i just turned down one last week for an incredible amount of money
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:45.320]  that would have really helped our operation but i said well i don't have a
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:48.920]  year to test this out and see if it's all true and the language is and i said
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:52.120]  sorry i'm not going to endorse your product

[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.960]  he did it and it is incredible and he would starve himself he'd go out and
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:25.720]  run at lunch he would do all this he would sit there and
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:29.080]  fight for years and then he got on minerals and
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:33.160]  vitamins and in way also uh and and just all the great

[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:57.240]  the story it's very sad i actually feel bad telling it
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:01.160]  his dad has Alzheimer's they go fishing hunting he couldn't really go fishing
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.160]  anymore because he didn't really know who he was
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:09.080]  six months on beyond tangy tangerine the essential fatty acid
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:13.080]  complex that they've come up with that's available at info wars team dot com
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:17.800]  his dad was able to fish who he was it was miraculous they tested his blood
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:21.000]  the doctor said the medical doctor said you're not allowed to have greens are
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.440]  you eating greens he said yeah that and um
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:29.080]  and beyond tangy tangerine polymers and stuff and he said nope
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.880]  he never had a stroke never had a heart problem he just they don't want him to
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:35.160]  have one he's on cubanin they said you're not allowed to have the vitamin k
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:38.600]  that's in the polymers and the beyond tangy tangerine and all of it by the
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:42.200]  polymers is just awesome with the vitamin b the the antioxidants the
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:45.080]  anti-age and the increased energy reduces oxidative
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:47.960]  damage against stress this is my second favorite available
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:53.400]  and info wars team dot com and and guess what the the medical doctor's god
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:57.560]  so he went off of it and his dad faded away in a few months and it's just
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:01.160]  it we literally sacrifice our children to the vaccines
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:04.120]  we sacrifice our parents to the medical doctors
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:09.080]  dr glitten i mean this is a cult we're fighting i mean he was back and the
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:12.600]  medical doctor said no you don't get to take
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:17.640]  that super mineral vitamin complex oh welcome to my world my people are
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:21.960]  destroyed for lack of knowledge and it is absolutely positively true md in the
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:25.480]  united states stands for medical deity i swear to god an md could put a white
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:27.800]  coat on strap a stethoscope around his neck tell
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:30.840]  someone to jump off the roof of the hospital and they'd do it
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:34.040]  this is how far down the rabbit hole we have gone in our
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:39.480]  unquestioning genuflection at the altar of md directed medicine we need to
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:43.000]  snap out of it we need to stop it because there exist
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:46.920]  right now today science-based clinically verified
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:50.360]  alternatives to drugs and surgery for all chronic health conditions and
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:54.360]  this weight loss is awesome but i tell you alex it's the tip of the iceberg
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:58.520]  and you know what last year we spent 70 billion with a b
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:02.360]  dollars on vitamins in this country and everybody is still sick
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:05.720]  why is that because when it comes to vitamins
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.800]  the recipe is everything vitamins are like you know wine
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:13.560]  they're all made from grapes but there's a great deal of difference between
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:16.440]  annie boonsprings green apple wine and a nice
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:21.400]  sonoma cabernet for goodness sake i've been practicing naturopathic medicine
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:24.280]  for 20 years i've been licensed for over two decades
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:30.040]  in the trenches frontline holistic medical care and you get good results
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:33.160]  with holistic medicine but as god is my witness
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:37.000]  for the last three years i have been mentoring with dr wallach
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.080]  following dr wallach's clinical lead using dr wallach's nutritional
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:44.840]  supplements and his therapeutics and i don't even know what planet i'm on
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:49.320]  anymore man because dr wallach has it dialed in
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:53.880]  his therapeutics eclipse anything that i had previously been exposed to and you
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:57.480]  seen my resume i've done a lot in my in my history
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:01.480]  i've done a lot in my career and wallach's therapeutics
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:05.400]  are eclipse and that's because i mean he you know he's he's
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:09.000]  several types of doctor but it's the veterinary angle when i heard him a
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.680]  decade ago and i didn't really dial it in but i heard it because i'd work for
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:15.640]  large animal that off and on for over a year total
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:20.360]  they were obsessed and at texas a&m with the animals getting their minerals
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:24.280]  for health for being able to handle stresses and it was always minerals
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:28.120]  minerals minerals minerals deficiencies connected to everything
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:32.920]  so the veterinary medicine people knew this i think that's why dr wallach was
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:37.240]  able to develop all this well he was in charge of 25 million
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:40.680]  dollars of federally funded research from 71 to 83
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:44.520]  they did 26 000 autopsies 10 million blood
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:48.440]  chemistries the publication that's the result of that 12 year
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:51.720]  research protocol that wallach did that he did the whole thing is in the
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:55.880]  smithsonian it's a national treasure and it is that
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:42:00.680]  body of of research combined with decades of clinical experience
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:05.080]  that makes wallach's therapeutics so extraordinary it's not because of you
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:11.320]  know anything uh you know mystical or or anything under under the table
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:15.720]  it's because wallach did the hard time no there's no physician on the planet
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:20.120]  that's done 25 million dollars of federally funded research 26 000
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:24.360]  autopsies 10 million blood chemistries and then follow that up with decades of
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:27.000]  clinical work it doesn't exist wallach's the only one
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.360]  i'm telling you wallach is the albert einstein
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:33.480]  of holistan no i mean people don't know but i looked into it back when i was
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:37.000]  here in these claims it's true i mean he was involved in like
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.960]  saving types of rhinos he was like the name in zoological veterinary
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:45.320]  research and and and of course those a lot of those are mammals
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:49.400]  and and and he learned it's the vitamins it's the minerals uh it's just amazing
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:53.800]  and and and all the infos at info wars team dot com i want to go to phone calls
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:56.120]  but but but let's get into those lawsuits i mean
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:00.120]  you know dr wallach is actually going after them he's beating them
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:05.320]  over and over again how does he do that well you know it's because he's got the
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:08.120]  truth on his side and you know good lawyers
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:10.920]  also right i mean you got to have a good lawyer you got to have the truth on
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:14.840]  your side and then you know you can't two plus two equals four no
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:17.800]  matter how many people want to tell you that it equals five well
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:21.000]  guess what it equals four i'll tell you two of wallach's
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.760]  lawsuits we can legally say because of dr wallach
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:27.960]  by the way i don't know if you know this but wallach doesn't make any money from
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:31.880]  the sale of vitamins in young jeffrey he removed himself from that revenue
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:34.920]  stream on purpose so that people could be a snake in
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:37.800]  the grass critics can't rise up and say oh that wallach
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:41.720]  he's just trying to make money selling vitamins well guess what he doesn't make
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:45.320]  any and he's sued the fda on your behalf
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:49.480]  out of his own pocket a lot so two of his
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:52.520]  health claims we can say that essential fatty acids
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:56.200]  virtually eliminate the risk of stroke this is omega three omega six and nine
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:59.160]  the only reason that you get a stroke is because your blood starts clotting
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:02.280]  funny the only reason your blood starts clotting funny is not because you have a
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:05.640]  bad gene not because you have a voodoo curse and
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:08.680]  certainly not because you have a coumadin deficiency
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:12.120]  it's because your blood has run out of the raw materials it needs to maintain
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:16.360]  its health it's that simple and we can say the 200
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:21.480]  micrograms of selenium supplementation reduces the occurrence of breast cancer
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:25.640]  prostate cancer uh breast cancer 82 percent prostate cancer 69
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:29.160]  percent colon cancer 64 percent and lung cancer
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:32.840]  39 percent that was published in the journal of the american medical
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:37.400]  association in 1998 but no one knows it and and
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:41.160]  you're called evil if you tell look look all i go on is the weight loss
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:45.880]  because i didn't have any medical issues uh other than i guess you know
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:49.160]  every once in a while a little bit of breakout which by the way i'm not
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.880]  having anymore since i've really actually been taking the regimen
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:55.080]  and a year and a half ago when i first got into it i did a little bit but i
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:58.280]  wasn't in the habit of doing it and i felt some effects well that well this
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:01.800]  is good i'll endorse it but now that i've really gotten into it
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:04.760]  and take the products i'm like well i better start taking all these other
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:07.640]  products and researching them that's why i only promote five or six of them
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:11.880]  because those are the ones that i've seen effects or family or friends
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:16.520]  you know that young jevities developed and that we promoted in fours team
[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:20.680]  dot com but again expanding on all of that
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:24.280]  the weight loss issue they don't even advertise pollen burst
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:27.720]  rebound beyond tangy tangerine uh for weight loss
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:33.640]  this is the i guess side effect of not being as hungry i mean i literally eat
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:39.800]  half what i used to and i'm satisfied and it's incredible
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:43.880]  look weight gain is a deficiency disease the md's have completely got it
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:48.360]  100 ass backwards weight gain is a deficiency disease
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:51.000]  it is not a disease of excess here's how it goes
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.840]  by the way we have the secret to weight loss not even opera knows and if you
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:58.760]  know opera you better get her on the phone because when we help
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:01.800]  opera lose weight with health the way that you did
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:04.600]  that's when we're really going to start to change the world
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:09.320]  your body has nutrient needs that are that are impossible to be met by food
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:14.040]  you cannot meet your body's nutritional needs just by eating food
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:18.280]  so everybody's nutritional tank is at least half full
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:23.000]  and then the stress of life comes rolling in you get more and more and more
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.720]  and more depleted in nutrients when your body reaches a certain level of
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:30.680]  nutritional lowness your central nervous system
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:34.760]  freaks out because it knows that you're running on fumes
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:38.040]  it knows that something bad's going to happen to your heart your lungs your
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:41.560]  liver your brain something's going to break so what does it do
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:47.240]  it makes you eat the only reason people gain weight is because they eat too many
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:50.520]  calories right nobody in Auschwitz was overweight
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:53.800]  i don't care what their genes were i don't care what their pre-existing
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:57.640]  medical condition was if you do not eat you lose weight
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:01.640]  the only thing that makes us gain weight as we eat too many calories the only
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:05.480]  thing that makes us eat too many calories is our bodies are
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:09.480]  nutritionally starved you go to your md he tells you you got to your stomachs
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:12.120]  too big got to cut it out got to put a band around it
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:16.200]  oh you're depressed oh you're lazy oh it's genetic
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:21.400]  guess what wrong wrong wrong and wrong the only reason people gain weight is
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:24.760]  they eat too many calories the only reason you eat too many
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:27.320]  calories is because you're nutritionally starved
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:31.640]  so when you take the beyond tangy tangerine and the essential fatty acids
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:34.840]  and the liquid plant minerals in that when you give your body the
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:37.240]  nutrients it needs you fill that tank up
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:41.800]  guess what you're nutritionally satisfied so you go to olive garden
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:45.800]  there's 3 000 calories on the plate you eat 500 take the rest home in a doggy
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:48.600]  bag because you're satisfied and the weight
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:54.200]  starts falling off without problems the best kept secret in the united states
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:56.680]  right now no kidding well the proofs in the pudding
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:02.360]  Aaron 90 plus pounds now i'm at 42 and a half pounds or so
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:06.680]  and it's just incredible in fact i'm going to have some tangy tangerine right
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:10.520]  now and i'd like to mix pollen burst in with it because guess what
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:14.680]  i rarely now drink coffee in the afternoon at night like i used to
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:17.640]  and i think a pollen burst all the b vitamins and it's got some caffeine in
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:21.000]  it it's a clean awake instead of what is in
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.280]  coffee i'm not bashing coffee i love the way it tastes and smells but
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:28.440]  what's the difference between a pollen burst and a cup of coffee
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:31.080]  well it's a great deal of difference between a pollen burst and a cup of
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:34.280]  coffee unless of course you're using java fit coffee by the young javadi
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:37.560]  company because that's been imbued with vitamins and minerals
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:42.280]  the pollen burst has vitamins and minerals and essential fat and i don't
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:44.680]  know if it has vitamins and minerals in it
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:50.520]  that your body needs to burn the energy that is already available to it
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:54.920]  properly it's kind of like a turbocharger for you know your your car
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:58.520]  kind of like the nox you know you press the button and you squirt the nitrogen
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:01.400]  into the tank and the car takes off like a bad out of hell
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:06.280]  well the pollen burst gives your body the raw materials that it needs to
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.920]  process the energy that it already has
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:12.600]  more efficiently and man it's i mean it's fantastic
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:17.080]  and i gotta i really can't wallach doesn't talk about himself enough you
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:20.760]  know he's he's a very humble man and as god is my witness
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:24.200]  that man has forgotten more about science
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:28.840]  that knows more about has forgotten more about science and medical nutrition
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:31.000]  than most doctors know that's what i'm trying to say
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:36.840]  he is unbelievable well it's true and we're about to go
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:39.240]  right and come back and take a few calls for two short segments we're gonna have
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:42.840]  to have you back but go over because you know wallach will say type two
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:46.520]  diabetes you can almost completely reverse it blah blah blah on and on and
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:48.920]  i'm like yeah yeah right even though i know this stuff's great
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:52.520]  and then i start getting the calls from people that have actually tried it
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:55.240]  and they're saying wow why did my medical doctor tell me this
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:59.640]  what's happening there well here's the deal your md
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:03.080]  is only trained in pharmaceutical and surgical medicine that's all they're
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:06.920]  trained in they have no training no respect no
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:09.800]  appreciation and no experience with anything other
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:13.800]  than drugs and see the problem with medicine in the united states
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:17.560]  is that the medical training the training of an md is a meat grinder
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:22.040]  so when you come out of medical school as an md you actually believe
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:25.480]  that if you weren't taught it in medical school it's just not valid
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:29.000]  these and md's bless their hearts are like colorblind
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.240]  art critics all they know is drugs and surgery all the time
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:37.080]  you want advice about medical nutrition come to see us

[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:34.920]  it took them half a year to figure out what was wrong with her
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:38.840]  and by the time they did the race was on
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:43.240]  they shelved her full of medications tests surgeries
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:46.840]  she went in the hospital for pneumonia in november of 2008

[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:09.800]  physician a whole surgeon dentist he's afraid to go
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:14.120]  growing up that they almost killed me when i had surgery on my leg and i want
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:19.160]  to get into the whole story but you know i i i've got a hernia and i'm afraid to
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:22.520]  go get it worked on and i'm just doing it with weight loss instead and i've
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:25.400]  actually talked to medical doctors says that's the way to do it but i mean i
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:31.000]  listen i'm scared of them that uh dr glidden comments on what she's saying
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:34.280]  well medical md directed medical treatments are the leading cause of
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:37.080]  death in the united states i mean the numbers are in numbers don't lie the
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:41.160]  third leading cause of death is cancer 550 000 people year second heart
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:45.160]  disease 700 000 the leading cause of death in the united
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:50.760]  states is treatments delivered by md's 780 000 people a year
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:54.760]  stop giving them your money look how long doctors live
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:57.720]  that's why it's dead doctors don't lie do they
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:01.320]  yeah that's exactly correct you know i want to read your real quote real quick
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:05.160]  here this was from benjamin rush one of the signers of the declaration of
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:08.600]  independence 200 years ago unless we put medical
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:11.400]  freedom into the constitution the time will come
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:15.160]  when medicine will organize itself into a dictatorship to restrict the art of
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:19.160]  healing to one class of men and deny equal privileges to others
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:23.000]  will constitute the best deal of medical science and that is exactly what we have
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:28.680]  in the united states it is an out of control medical monopoly
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:31.320]  you're right ma'am i'm sorry to hear that happen to your daughter and your
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:35.720]  husband uh in in a one month period you said

[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:46.440]  a naturopathic doctor of medicine in 10 minutes after answering a few questions
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:49.480]  he nearly jumped out of his seat and said candida
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:55.400]  candida this is they didn't they were treating her symptoms they operated on
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:59.160]  her until she she had a massive stroke which is what
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:03.320]  actually took her out she had a stroke and she went to the doctor
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:07.800]  complaining about uh a inflammation and uh pain in her chest and pain in her

[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:58.840]  you know telling trying to convince an md who's fresh out of medical school
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:03.320]  that there is another alternative or that's one aspect of their therapeutics
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:07.000]  are wrong and not working it's a fool's errand it's never going to work it's like trying
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:11.080]  to convince a slave owner that slaves are people and not animals it's not
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:13.960]  going to work i would just move on don't worry
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:17.960]  about it go tell her to pound sand that's what i would do

[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:35.640]  it's gonna be a law to make us buy insurance to gain access to a system of
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:39.000]  medicine that doesn't work you've got to be kidding what about how
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.160]  they're forcing chemotherapy on people now i mean it's a totally don't even get

[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:51.160]  reference i think it was 1994 the journal of clinical oncology journal
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:55.560]  of clinical oncology they did a 12 year study on adults who
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:59.480]  developed cancer and retreated with chemotherapy it was published
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:03.640]  the journal of of clinical oncology and here were the results
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:09.640]  97 of the time chemotherapy does not work it doesn't work
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:13.480]  that was published in the journal of clinical oncology now can somebody

[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:27.320]  profit industry they know doc you know my research in eugenics have you found
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:31.480]  that this is a premeditated program well yeah
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:34.600]  i there's evidence to support that fact alex
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:38.680]  i'm not sure that they're that smart i think that there might be a cadre of
[02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:43.400]  people involved at the top that that was their intention no exactly no no no
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:47.080]  the low level are just compartmentalized not even thinking i agree
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:50.760]  yeah i agree with you there well yeah i know
[02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:55.640]  you look at the you look at the numbers i mean i mean if it looks like a duck
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:59.480]  sounds like a duck flies like a duck it's probably a duck but it doesn't
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:01.880]  matter i was looking at statistics where many pediatric
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:08.040]  cancers are up 10 000 percent from 1950 i mean this is a this is incredible

[02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:38.600]  if you've studied mayday or you can go to the mainline
[02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:42.280]  history of mayday in europe it was a druidic
[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:47.640]  ritual day and it goes back to pre-christian times
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:51.960]  and then the jackabins the french revolution the the illuminati the real
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:56.520]  illuminati that's in the history books they picked it up as their big holiday
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:59.080]  and when the big banking houses funded it
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:02.680]  as a way to bring in a new form of feudalism or serfdom to bring down the
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:05.480]  old nation state and the monarchies and bring in this absolute
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:09.560]  illuminati rule that became the communist holiday and we saw
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:12.440]  vitamir putin and all the rest of the day marching and
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:16.360]  obama's talking about how great it is and they they captured the easter bunny i
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:19.560]  mean or or killed the easter bunny ben laden
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:23.400]  on this day a year ago and if you believe that you believe santa claus
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:27.640]  comes down the chimney so i thought how perfect it was
[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:30.520]  jones calzen was going to come in to talk about the state of politics in the
[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:33.240]  world and things like that but i thought i thought oh my gosh let's call
[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:36.680]  him before he gets here he's in studio let's call him before he gets here and
[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:39.880]  let's talk about communism mayday how the ultra rich
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:43.480]  want socialism and communism that doesn't make sense to people on the
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:46.520]  surface but carol quigley at georgetown bill clinton's mentor
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:50.920]  he wrote they want communism fascism socialism to consolidate control they
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:53.800]  want to merge these different systems
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:57.480]  they want to play kind of a right-wing fascism off against a communism
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:01.160]  but really at the end of the day you end up getting this synthesis that's the
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:04.760]  same thing and of course he has published
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:08.680]  really the bible on strategic relocation i've done research into it
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:12.280]  amazing information strategic relocation or the american god to save
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:15.320]  places third edition available at info wars
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:19.720]  dot com and of course we shot a hour and a half interview a few weeks ago that's
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:23.960]  gone viral on the web that i titled secrets of survival
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:29.960]  with joel scalzen of course his uncle wrote a multiple best-selling books but
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:33.640]  the big one was the naked communist and i remember
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:38.440]  being on the bookshelf at my grandfather's house and i remember
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:41.320]  i actually seen my dad reading it when i was a child
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:45.320]  and then all these years later we realized how important that book was but
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:49.160]  now we've learned even more so again why do we see warren
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:52.680]  buffett calling for higher taxes why do we see bill gates
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:56.920]  warren buffett's the biggest recipient of bailout money
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:11:01.240]  so it's a very simple equation they want socialism and communism
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:04.440]  socialism into communism to shut down their competition
[02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:07.560]  they're exempt from the laws they pass and they get your money
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:11.800]  in corporate welfare and corporate contracts and i should add
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:16.280]  what one final point most important they can selectively
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:20.840]  enforce all that hey carbon taxes but all the insiders they're exempt
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:25.160]  oh national healthcare but thousands of companies that are insiders they're
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:29.560]  exempt it's unfair trade advantages so they want
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:33.160]  tyranny but only for you and only when they feel like it the
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:37.480]  essence of corruption is unjust weights and measures
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:42.120]  and so that's what this system is and a complexity of agenda 21 all these
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:45.400]  regions all of this these these committees
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:49.400]  regional government political correctness hate speech
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:53.800]  it's all directly out of the soviet union model
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:57.640]  which came from the west and joseph mccarthy this has since been leaked by
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:00.120]  the russians and the new york times years ago i didn't
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:03.400]  admit oh mccarthy was right when he came out and said
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:07.240]  that there was a communist conspiracy but they destroyed him
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:13.000]  at the point that he came out and said oh my gosh the elites in the west are
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.440]  actually in bed with them that's when they destroyed him they could use the
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:19.320]  red scare to take basic liberties that was great
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:22.920]  okay and build up the police state here but as soon as he discovered
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:26.760]  how deep the rabbit hole went they destroyed him now joel you can correct
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:29.560]  any of those points if you disagree with it or expand on it but
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:34.040]  give us on this mayday basically how the bankers operate how they work
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:38.280]  what you've expanded on from your late uncle clion scowling
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:43.720]  and where we currently are in this dialectic my introduction to this whole
[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:47.000]  field was through clion's naked communist i remember reading it as a
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:50.840]  teenager and being shocked at the amount of information about how
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:55.400]  the government actually facilitated communist governments coming to power
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:59.320]  and so my uncle and many others at that time early on in pre-gold water
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:03.640]  movement really came to the conclusion the real threat was the communist
[02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:07.480]  powers and everything we were fighting against was against communism
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:11.080]  but it wasn't that way later on my uncle found out
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:14.600]  that it was in fact capitalist colluding with common
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:18.840]  communist he wrote the book the naked capitalist which was the critique of
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:25.960]  carol quigley's tragedy and hope it suddenly got him a lot of flak
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:30.040]  because anytime you the establishment didn't want carol quigley to write that
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:34.280]  book and but he did in fact they shut
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:39.000]  down the last last edition after he died wouldn't let his wife republish that
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:43.960]  but that's the real story about communism not only its rise but the left
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:47.960]  or the the west facilitating that went even back before the communist
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:51.560]  revolution lenin was kept in relative luxury in
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:56.680]  germany by western powers paying the bills and keeping him in reserve
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:00.680]  when the 1917 revolution in russia happened
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:06.040]  the korenski regime came in as because the bolsheviks were losing they came in
[02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:10.680]  to produce a coalition government as they always do to have a ceasefire
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:14.360]  so that the west could then systematically deny arms to the white
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:19.640]  russian army and feed arms to the bolsheviks and that's why the
[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:22.840]  bolsheviks eventually won and by the way that's all been now released and
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:26.200]  admitted and i even saw history channel where the old cia
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:31.160]  section chief admitted our government did indeed put malin to power and send
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:36.200]  rifles without the firing pins to shank i shek i mean it's all on record
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:39.640]  that's right and then eventually they cut off all arms to change shank i shek
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:43.640]  now this was uh uh george catlett marshall
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:48.360]  who was the one who controlled eisenhower in the supreme allied command
[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:52.120]  he was the one who directed eisenhower as a good yes man to operation
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:57.080]  do operation keelhaul to starve out two million german prisoners
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:01.320]  a lot of tragedies occurred in world war two a lot of war crimes occurred in
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:06.040]  world bombing of civilians purposely to induce hitler to bomb
[02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:09.800]  london hitler never would have bombed london had it not been for churchill
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:13.640]  deciding we've got to provoke him and so we're going to fire bomb the rurer
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:18.120]  and that's what triggered hitler finally to take on uh but there's been so much
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:20.840]  in history that it isn't covered in in today's history
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:24.680]  some of the most egregious examples of
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:28.600]  the globalist and american government for for many communist revolutions
[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:32.920]  happened in uh in vietnam the they used to use the model of
[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:36.920]  having a coalition government in laos for example
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:41.400]  and especially where laos fell because they forced a coalition government
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:44.600]  upon the uh the forces that were beating the
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:48.040]  anti-communist and then once they had forced them into a coalition government
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:52.280]  cut off military supply again give power to the communists and then they
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:55.720]  run through and and kill the rest of the people
[02:15:55.720 --> 02:15:58.920]  we had some a terrible tragedy happened in cuba of course
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:05.560]  where uh we found that the cia actually gave arms and ammunition to to castro
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:09.880]  then they vilified uh batista they published through herbert matthews
[02:16:09.880 --> 02:16:14.120]  they always have a patsy within the cia controlled reporter in the new york
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:18.680]  times um used to be drew pierce from washington post
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:22.360]  later on by jack anderson until he kind of repented and
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:26.120]  tried to get out of the system that's a different story
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:31.080]  but they also did that same model against anastasia samosa one of the most
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:36.600]  pro-free market pro-western people in nicaragua in central america and they
[02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:41.160]  crucified that guy uh in fact they finally after they had
[02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:44.680]  given arms to the sandinistas and allowed them to control nicaragua they
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:49.640]  promised anastasia samosa that he'd have a free pass if he'd give up power
[02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:56.440]  set him up in in paraguay and then allowed them to uh to kill him
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:17:00.360]  so there's a tremendous amount of bad blood among many people in latin america
[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:04.040]  against the betrayals of the american government tried to do the same thing in
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:08.280]  el salvador and more or less didn't work i was a political advisor down there
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:13.400]  our own state department people were the ones that were in fact
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:17.560]  trying to stop us i was a political advisor to the arena party
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:21.960]  under roberto da bison and even though he was kind of corrupt and later sold out
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:25.960]  the people under him that supported him the so-called oligarchs of latin
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:30.040]  america were in fact true patriots very very good high class people
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:33.960]  really understood what the battle was about but i remember the ambassador
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:36.760]  telling me when i was complaining about the
[02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:40.440]  evidence and the help that they were giving to the to the revolutionaries
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:44.600]  there in el salvador and what we were trying to do i was naive at that time
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:49.080]  trying to set up an american-style democracy an american-style republic
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:53.800]  actually under our constitutional ages with the arena party and they said look
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:57.400]  you can have any government in salvador you want but it can't mimic the u.s
[02:17:57.400 --> 02:18:02.760]  constitution we don't want it you can't have it
[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:07.480]  and sure enough about a month after that a big well-heeled salvador and came in
[02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:10.520]  with a lot of money the arena party was small before that
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:14.200]  was always lacking funding and he came in with a big lot of cash
[02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:17.800]  offered it to them if they'd give him a major position in the party and from
[02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:23.720]  that major position they ended up eroding the ideological base of the arena
[02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:26.760]  party turned it into a mainstream republican party started
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:30.760]  compromised won the election but they never did overturn
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:36.920]  the socialist direction of the country because of those compromises so
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:40.040]  this is the way that the government works now when when cuba happened what
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:43.320]  was interesting about the documentation in cuba
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:47.160]  is that the uh the ambassador to cuba
[02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:50.280]  was a friend of general eisenhower very very close friend
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:55.480]  he was a strong anti-communist and he got very upset when he found out
[02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:59.160]  how batista was being undermined when the state department was cutting off the
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:03.880]  arms to him in order to make sure that cuba or castor could win
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:07.320]  he called eisenhower on the phone and he said dwight you know something's
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:11.080]  not wrong here we're getting the wrong information out of the state department
[02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:14.280]  he said well go to the state department go up to the fourth floor which was this
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:17.800]  hotbed of communist and and find out what's going on so
[02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:21.720]  ambassador url smith comes back to the united states goes up to the fourth
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:26.120]  floor of the state department and he finds out that
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:29.880]  the top people who are not communists are protecting the communists in the
[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:34.120]  state department he wanted them removed they refused to do that
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:38.680]  he documented it in his book knife in the heart of
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:42.360]  trying to think what anyway it was a very very good book on the
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:45.960]  entire betrayal of cuba that happened from our own state department
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:49.960]  we've got to go to break why do the ultra rich want
[02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:53.560]  to put communism in places i want to explain that dialectic

[02:23:51.400 --> 02:24:00.840]  self-reliance and food independence
[02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:04.120]  this is the
[02:24:04.120 --> 02:24:09.160]  vhs to release bacteria in boston subway system you can't make that up
[02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:12.760]  that's breaking at info wars dot com right now we'll cover that more before
[02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:16.280]  the hour ends also on the nightly news tonight
[02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:20.120]  fbi arrest anarchists in a cleveland bomb plot
[02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:24.600]  you see they have to create the idea of a threat so they create al-qaeda then
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:28.040]  they fund it and they protect it the al-qaeda groups actually in some cases
[02:24:28.040 --> 02:24:31.400]  funds real terrorists who really even believe in what they're doing or just
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:34.520]  criminals and it's the same thing with communism you've
[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:37.800]  got to create the threat take the liberties in the name of responding
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:40.680]  to that threat that actually moves you closer to being
[02:24:40.680 --> 02:24:45.800]  like what you're trying to fight you become evil because well we've got to
[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:50.280]  break the rules to defeat the evil and this is part of the more
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:54.040]  sophisticated system and it goes back to the Rothschilds and others
[02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:57.640]  where they would just fund all sides in a war they had european conflicts where
[02:24:57.640 --> 02:25:00.920]  there'd be two or three four different factions sometimes
[02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:03.960]  and the big banks would fund it all and carol quickly
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:08.040]  in his book bill clinton's mentor he was allowed access to the
[02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:12.040]  the documents where the elite admitted all this he he thought it was a great
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:14.760]  system he was proud of it he wanted to talk about it
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:18.440]  and then joel scousen's uncle wrote about it gave it a lot of attention
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:22.280]  and here we are today and i think that's one reason we have a jump on these
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:26.120]  people at a certain levels because of your uncle and ron paul and and and
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:30.440]  jebra griffin and countless others who for 30 40 50 60 years
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:34.280]  have been out there exposing this and myself now for 17
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:38.040]  but only if we point out that we were right and explain the nature of the
[02:25:38.040 --> 02:25:42.840]  threat this is a short segment we'll continue into the next long segment but
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:46.040]  you can keep giving examples of this and if you're a new listener folks go look
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:48.200]  up everything he's saying it's all on record now
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:51.240]  i mean i knew this a long time ago but when i saw on history channel
[02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:55.960]  the cia section chief you know doing an interview from the time in 49
[02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:59.240]  he was very elderly the interview and they admitted oh yeah we put malin power
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:03.400]  like it was funny mal killed between 64 and 80 plus million people
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:08.120]  they debate that the chinese say 80 plus mil he says you are the cia says 60
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:12.120]  something but i mean joel again why who are the
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:15.480]  elites why do they want this what is the larger plan
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:19.320]  how do they plan to merge this what's the what's the end game
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:22.920]  well let me first comment on the dialectic self because that's where we
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:27.000]  left off the dialectics is crucial to their power because
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:31.480]  if left to its own devices history will inexorably drift towards more liberty
[02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:35.320]  people continue to resist tyranny most people are good in life
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:38.760]  it takes a concerted few to manipulate and and
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:42.840]  keep those people from from from gaining liberty the dialectic that is
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:46.440]  creating a boogeyman creating a real enemy like china and russia
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:51.640]  allows them to destroy nations uh from afar with an arms link
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:54.600]  transaction it allows them to get rid of certain
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:57.880]  countries it allows them to stop the liberty movement
[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:01.640]  and as you said then replace it with a globalist which is a phony
[02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:05.560]  they always make revolution against corruption and fascism communist
[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:08.840]  as if that's the only form of resistance that's right
[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:13.080]  now the end game of this of course is to eventually
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:16.920]  get us into a globalist world government and that's why it took
[02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:20.120]  one more one major war the world of the first world war
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:23.320]  in order to start this international process the league of nations that
[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:27.160]  failed miserably a tremendous amount of
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:30.280]  anti and very intelligent if you read the arguments against the league of
[02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:32.760]  nations these people were very well informed
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:38.360]  at the time and wilson even let it out in his
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:41.960]  dying days that he in fact was snuckered and he a lot of people think he was
[02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:45.400]  poisoned he wrote a letter and said oh my gosh the banks have taken over
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:48.920]  i've sold out to a foreign power basically yeah that's right
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:52.520]  world war two got him a lot further uh they were talking in their written
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:56.440]  language about the united nations three years before it was actually created so
[02:27:56.440 --> 02:27:59.240]  you know they were operating under a globalist agenda
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:03.560]  before that united nations was put into power but world war two got them the
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:07.400]  the world government beginnings but it didn't have any military power and i
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:09.560]  believe that that's where the end game is
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:12.760]  this next third world war that they're planning
[02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:16.120]  where russia and china that they built up for many many years will finally attack
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:19.640]  the west is being prepared it's being planned
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:23.880]  and it's being covered up that is the threat is being covered up
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:27.080]  by the powers to be so that we can finally get people
[02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:30.840]  in the depths of a nuclear attack to finally give all power to the government
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:34.760]  who will our leader and that's why they give the Panama Canal that we built
[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:38.840]  just y'all here have it that's why we give the inland ports to the communist
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:41.880]  chinese what do you make because i've confirmed this has been done covertly
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:46.120]  since clinton at least but now they admit russian spit snats training to
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:49.720]  basically seize control of key installations inside the u.s.
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:53.240]  well this is a suicide philosophy you've got to remember that the russians
[02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:56.840]  have always been very reluctant to to attack the united states
[02:28:56.840 --> 02:29:00.600]  even with disarmament the russians still suspect that we're hiding a lot of
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:03.480]  weapons and we are hiding a lot of high-tech weapons
[02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:06.680]  trouble is our government doesn't intend to pull those out and use those to
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:10.840]  protect us they intend to reserve those fill after the attack
[02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:14.760]  so that then they can prosecute this third world war against russia
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:18.440]  and win it for the new world order not for american sovereign state there let's
[02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:21.160]  explain this you can see it that's why i agree with a lot of what you're breaking
[02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:24.760]  down it's one of the main programs they're following
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:28.600]  that everything is an infrastructure for after an attack and you think
[02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:33.240]  we're fascist now imagine we lost 150 million americans but the new america
[02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:37.240]  rose i mean it is going to be bad and i i wonder if even
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:40.360]  talking about it'll stop the russians and others from taking part
[02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:44.760]  we'll be right back stay with us this is key information straight ahead
[02:29:44.760 --> 02:29:48.600]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[02:31:57.960 --> 02:32:02.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:32:02.040 --> 02:32:05.960]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants
[02:32:05.960 --> 02:32:09.400]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:32:09.400 --> 02:32:12.280]  it's true total government control of electricity
[02:32:12.280 --> 02:32:15.800]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[02:32:15.800 --> 02:32:19.400]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:32:19.400 --> 02:32:23.320]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:32:23.320 --> 02:32:26.920]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:32:26.920 --> 02:32:29.960]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:32:29.960 --> 02:32:33.080]  onages number five a solar power generator provides

[02:33:09.160 --> 02:33:25.080]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:30.360]  jones galzen is our guest in studio he of course is a um
[02:33:30.360 --> 02:33:34.520]  marine corps fighter pilot from the vietnam era has an amazing bio
[02:33:34.520 --> 02:33:39.080]  you can learn more about him at worldaffairsbrief.com his website
[02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:42.600]  he is the editor of that important analysis
[02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:46.360]  journal we have links to that up at info wars.com
[02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:50.520]  i want to go over the communist manifesto the ten planks a little bit
[02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:54.280]  just to illustrate how close we've actually gotten to this
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:58.920]  and how both political parties pushed these ideas but we were getting in
[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:02.760]  to the synthesis we were getting into an attack
[02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:07.480]  on the united states and how we're being prepared for this
[02:34:07.480 --> 02:34:11.480]  and then there's going to be a below ground police state infrastructure for
[02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:15.640]  after undoubtedly if you look at the amount of
[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:19.560]  spending and and and funding and covered operations
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:23.640]  underground base construction from what i've seen inside the united states
[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:27.800]  and and and canada to a certain extent is almost as big as all the other
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:30.680]  building by other countries around the world the russians the communist
[02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:36.920]  chinese they're all doing it as well but the program for cog
[02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:40.920]  is so massive continuity of government here everything is built around it the
[02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:45.080]  rand corporation is obsessed with it dr strange love is a satire
[02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:48.120]  piece by stanley cubrick on that where they plan to take the whole
[02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:52.920]  civilization underground the seed vaults the dna vaults
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:57.720]  the elite behaving as if civilization won't be here soon so they don't care
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:01.560]  what we say and what we do world government now
[02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:04.760]  more and more out in the open but still they say you're crazy if you talk
[02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:08.200]  about it joel i want to get into the 10 planks of
[02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:11.960]  the communist manifesto with you and mayday and what's happening right now
[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:18.120]  but continue with the larger plan the the factions as you see them and why you
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:21.800]  think russian troops are here being trained
[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:26.760]  it's very important that they overcome the natural resistance to the russians
[02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:30.760]  and the and the chinese communists have about attacking the united states
[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:34.520]  they have been fearful they've been trying to get this war on the road
[02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:38.520]  they thought initially it was going to happen before the year 2000 here we are
[02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:42.520]  almost 12 years later and it still hasn't happened the russians are scared
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:46.200]  stiff the russians also have a lot of internal problems
[02:35:46.200 --> 02:35:49.720]  part of that is manufactured in order to feign weakness before a strike but
[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:52.680]  frankly very little works in the civilians
[02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:56.680]  sector you there's too many people who translate that to nothing works on the
[02:35:56.680 --> 02:36:01.720]  military sector as well but that isn't true the military sector is probably
[02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:06.280]  only about 10 points behind the united states in terms of sophistication
[02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:10.200]  what they have though is a huge conventional structure of military
[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:14.280]  equipment that once the initial high top end of
[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:17.800]  any military is knocked out by the nuclear war it's going to be mostly
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:21.320]  conventional they got a tremendous advantage in conventional
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:24.600]  so a lot of power when it comes to a long slug out that's right
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:27.320]  same thing with the chinese they of course got that back up and they're
[02:36:27.320 --> 02:36:31.560]  going to be technologically in another 10 years up on par with the united
[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:36.120]  states so the problem has been how did we induce
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:40.120]  the russians to get off the stick and finally make this attack on the russians
[02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:43.800]  same thing like the west funding hitler wall street the rise of hitler that was
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:47.240]  all a setup i mean they that's right that's they really want this
[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:51.240]  and they want to get it going in the next decade or so before china becomes
[02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:55.480]  superior well that's right but there's an interplay there
[02:36:55.480 --> 02:36:59.080]  you know we we talked originally about some conservatives coming to the
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:03.160]  conclusion that the globalist are in bed with the communist and this isn't
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:06.600]  exactly true this comes from the roan gayther quote
[02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:10.440]  which was a piece of disinformation that roan gayther head of the ford
[02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:13.000]  foundation gave to the congressional investigating
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:16.760]  chief who was investigating why they were always funding communism he gave
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:19.720]  them this lame excuse they're trying to merge the two
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:22.760]  so the two societies could merge peacefully
[02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:26.440]  it wasn't true but it led the birch society and others to the
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:29.720]  false concoct what it is is use the threat to sell a police state here to
[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:33.720]  counter it right and and to induce another
[02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:38.040]  because the united states and globalists go over there and they
[02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:42.200]  play ball they give them truck factories they give them technology
[02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:45.800]  uh it is incorrect to conclude that they're in collusion
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:49.560]  directly for the same purposes they're not they're co-predators well that's
[02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:52.680]  like hitler it isn't that hitler was a british
[02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:56.840]  agent but it's on record they funded him because they wanted the new enemy so
[02:37:56.840 --> 02:37:59.400]  they had an excuse to wreck europe and take it over that's right in fact they
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:03.720]  had to induce hitler to strike london he always held out that
[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:07.640]  england would join him in control he had that secret peace treaty that's why he
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:11.080]  sent rudolf s over to parachute him knowing i have the treaty
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:13.800]  and they're like you're locked up in the tower buddy and by the way that's all
[02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:17.480]  been released now they admit that hitler wouldn't bomb because he thought the
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:20.200]  brits were like the supreme areas because they hadn't you know intermarried
[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:21.960]  or what i mean i'm just what hitler really said
[02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:25.640]  he wouldn't bomb those populations he would only bomb military bases so they
[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:28.600]  went like you said firebomber linen stuff in other areas
[02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:32.520]  to try to get him angry to do it firebomb the ruror the ruror the ruror
[02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:35.320]  i'm going from memory i just remember that whole that's right and and how it was a
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:39.240]  plan of uh church held like making it angry exactly and so this is really
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:43.800]  criminal activity in the part of the west to induce this but the end game
[02:38:43.800 --> 02:38:47.400]  is the fact that they know that there's this heritage of freedom there's
[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:50.520]  heritage of constitutional law which has been their nemesis for
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:54.280]  for centuries in the united states the only way to overcome that
[02:38:54.280 --> 02:38:58.760]  is to drive it out of people through war and a war so catastrophic
[02:38:58.760 --> 02:39:02.120]  too many people keep asking me as evidence against the conspiracy
[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:05.720]  why would these people ever destroy their country which is giving them all the
[02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:11.160]  wealth and the power and uh and 9 11 was a mini beta test could
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:14.600]  they sell and overthrow the republic off of an attack
[02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:18.360]  imagine what they can do off of a nuclear war or or off of something really
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:21.880]  big a nuclear war is the mother of all terrorist attacks and it's terrorism
[02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:24.360]  not because they're terrorists that are going to do this
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:28.200]  it's because our government is going to allow it to happen knows it's coming
[02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:31.320]  covering for it covering for all the weapons development it's interesting
[02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:35.640]  you never see a yearly report from the pentagon on the russian threat
[02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:40.280]  never never happens you do have one a token report on the chinese threat
[02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:44.200]  and every single report downplays the threat after they've given i was about
[02:39:44.200 --> 02:39:46.760]  to say why are they moving all those bases to the pacific
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:49.400]  why did the chinese president three months ago say
[02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:53.320]  publicly prepare for war with the u.s unprecedented yeah uh the
[02:39:53.320 --> 02:39:56.280]  here's what i think the strategy and how this is going to play out
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:40:00.760]  the chinese are going to be alive they are allowed allied right now with russia
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:03.480]  to start this war russia's going to take the lead
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:07.560]  china will basically use some of its nuclear weapons as a backup russian
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:10.680]  nuclear weapons will use for the first strike they're going to only hit the
[02:40:10.680 --> 02:40:14.440]  united states in uk and their nuclear bases no
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:18.040]  cities except those where it can't be helped
[02:40:18.040 --> 02:40:21.240]  i'm predicting about 15 u.s cities are going to go down
[02:40:21.240 --> 02:40:25.000]  be vaporized but the rest of the nation will survive
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:28.760]  after some radiation fallout sickness was that what 888 was
[02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:33.480]  with with cheney and georgia trying to go ahead and get the war then
[02:40:33.480 --> 02:40:36.920]  remember when cheney you know had him roll in you know to northern georgia
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:41.160]  and the russians rolled nukes in and that whole fracas in 2008
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:44.280]  the whole georgian conflict was that in a georgia that
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:47.400]  yeah about internationally
[02:40:48.040 --> 02:40:52.840]  that's a little complex it wasn't a prelude to this what that was
[02:40:52.840 --> 02:40:57.800]  is the the globalists know that one of the things that will lead to wars the
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:01.320]  russians will begin to use the millions of russians that they've
[02:41:01.320 --> 02:41:04.680]  moved into the former soviet states and the baltics
[02:41:04.680 --> 02:41:10.360]  use them as provocation to justify russian militarism and going in to
[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:13.960]  protect those people they will create agent provocateurs just like hitler
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:18.360]  did in the sudetenland chekoslovak danzig and danzig
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:22.200]  create a tax on the russian people then justify showing
[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:27.000]  finally the new russian military force moving in to protect those people
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:31.960]  georgia was one of those provocations that the u.s handed the russians so that
[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:36.040]  they could begin that process there will be others but that was a first
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:39.400]  in the preserve the motherland preserve the motherland people
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:42.920]  which will and when i've told people in my world's affairs briefs that one of
[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:45.720]  the reasons you'll know that war is getting close
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:48.680]  is when russia starts to move troops back in
[02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:51.720]  to the former soviet states to protect russian people
[02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:55.640]  now i think the actual trigger for the war will be north korea
[02:41:55.640 --> 02:41:59.880]  attacking south korea because that requires that the us
[02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:03.240]  use nuclear weapons to stop it there's no way you can
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:06.280]  stop north koreans and then china has a treaty
[02:42:06.280 --> 02:42:10.600]  and tina has a treaty and so if the u.s can be induced to use nuclear weapons
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:14.600]  to start to stop a chinese invasion of south korea
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:17.400]  which is overwhelming we don't have enough troops our troops are being
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:22.120]  maintained there as cannon fodder so that we can get struck
[02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:27.080]  we can get bloodied pearl harvard yeah and then of course china will then have
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:30.120]  an excuse to come in and use nuclear weapons in russia
[02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:34.280]  because we got to stop this first use by the united states of nuclear weapons
[02:42:34.280 --> 02:42:37.560]  stop the bully of the world and russia comes right over beside north korea
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:40.840]  they've got land right there let me expand to the south you know the
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:43.320]  whole red dawn scenario i know there's been big on roads
[02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:46.440]  by russia in mexico and other areas of latin america
[02:42:46.440 --> 02:42:49.560]  what happens if there is this first strike a stand down
[02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:53.320]  and then all this takes place won't they try to because i've already seen this
[02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:56.760]  to the ford foundation the rest of it again handing it to russia
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:43:02.200]  the ford foundation and others hyping up this la raza la reconquista oslon
[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:05.560]  southwest and i hear that from those groups we're going to come
[02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:09.880]  with the commies and just pour right in up and then make that a racial type deal
[02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:12.600]  i mean is how does that add into the constellation
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:16.600]  from what defectors what information i've got from defectors from the soviet
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:21.560]  former soviet union they do not intend neither russia or china to occupy
[02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:25.320]  initially they want to use a preemptive nuclear strike to neutralize the united
[02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:28.840]  states and england where the major nuclear power and then start
[02:43:28.840 --> 02:43:32.520]  power grabbing other areas and and then blackmail europe into
[02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:34.840]  submission they want to take europe without a fight
[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:41.160]  now the globals will make sure that they don't let the europeans capitulate
[02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:45.560]  they will then start a war so the stage two is the russians and chinese still
[02:43:45.560 --> 02:43:48.440]  not wanting to invade because it's a long
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:51.880]  way you know it's just suicide to start just like hitler
[02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:55.880]  getting too far into russia couldn't sustain that pipeline
[02:43:55.880 --> 02:43:58.920]  of military material russian china aren't eager to try to do that
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:02.440]  they're going to use surrogates in latin america to come north
[02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:06.840]  to destabilize the united states what they aren't counting on of course
[02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:11.240]  is the u.s is planning to take this for nuclear first strike
[02:44:11.240 --> 02:44:16.600]  to then feign completely being down to drum us into a militarized new world
[02:44:16.600 --> 02:44:19.960]  order it won't be the united nations they'll call it the league of democracies
[02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:23.800]  they'll exclude all the communist nations as they should have in the beginning
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:26.760]  they purposely led them all into the united nation because they wanted to
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:29.800]  create conflict as we've been talking about
[02:44:29.800 --> 02:44:33.640]  what they aren't anticipating though is that the us will bring out all of these
[02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:36.840]  high-tech weapons that they're hiding give them
[02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:39.960]  hand them out to europe as i've talked to bob bowman and he can only talk about
[02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:44.520]  what they've leaked on accident star wars was around in the 70s
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:50.920]  and by the by 79 they had total decapitation systems with du meteor
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:55.080]  gun sabos you know robotic uh basically satellites up there
[02:44:55.080 --> 02:44:58.840]  that have non nuclear but but it's it's a meteor gun it'll kill people a mile
[02:44:58.840 --> 02:45:01.960]  under the ground it'll go right through a mountain and they've got
[02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:06.120]  a lot of these he said in the 70s and he's the former head of star wars
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:09.960]  uh they already had those up there so there's undoubtedly a lot of secret
[02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:12.520]  technology there is i've got confirmation of that as
[02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:17.560]  well but they will still allow those first strikes to hit
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:20.840]  and then they may limit additional strikes but they want to make sure there's
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:23.720]  enough destruction in the united states to drive the american people into
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:26.440]  complete despair so that they throw down all the
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:29.880]  barriers and just say to the government well that's the same model as what 9
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:32.680]  11 is take the attack and invade a bunch of countries
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:35.960]  that's right but this time the attack is going to be on america it's going to
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:40.200]  shock america we don't aren't prepared for it we've never expected america to
[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:44.360]  be attacked it will happen someday i can guarantee people
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:48.440]  and so but in in the long term scenario i think
[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:52.280]  what happens though is that we'd never regain our country back
[02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:57.240]  in terms of all of liberty but there will be bastions in pockets because one of
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:00.360]  the things they do lose control of in a nuclear attack
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:03.240]  is they lose the continuity of government that they're preserving i mean
[02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:06.920]  it's still there but it doesn't control all parts of the country they got the
[02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:09.560]  central systems they got the central system there's a
[02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:14.520]  based in washington dc which is going to be fairly well destroyed and colorado
[02:46:14.520 --> 02:46:17.960]  they got denver is one of the major centers that's the major control i
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:21.880]  suspect that the new world is going to move into denver after
[02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:26.360]  um color or after washington dc is they pretty much already have i mean they
[02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:32.680]  visit their prostitutes in dc yeah but uh ultimately i think for the cause
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:35.880]  of liberty it's going to be and one of the reasons why i
[02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:38.440]  believe so much in strategic relocation they're going to be
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:40.840]  pockets of resistance and it's going to be
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:44.520]  noised about and rumors will abound of people saying there's liberty here and
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:47.880]  there's liberty there and there's safety here and people will start to migrate
[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:51.720]  our greatest weakness alexis that were all spread out uniformly around the
[02:46:51.720 --> 02:46:53.800]  united states and we don't have a majority
[02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:57.800]  anywhere the free state movement tried to change that by moving into either
[02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:01.880]  wyomingen new hampshire they chose new hampshire unfortunately which is not
[02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:06.440]  in a strategic relocation but the idea was to move in enough people to have
[02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:10.200]  a majority and i had always backfires
[02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:13.480]  it had backfired to the rajneesh that tried to move in and created a haven in
[02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:15.560]  oregon it backfired for the mormons trying to move
[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:19.160]  into missouri and then illinois you know people just say
[02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:22.120]  hey they're moving in they're going to outvote us kick them out of course the
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:26.200]  mormons were anti-slavery and so they they got kicked out the same
[02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:28.760]  things happened to the free state people new hampshire is building up an
[02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:31.560]  anti you know movement chuck balton's running into the
[02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:34.440]  same thing the powers that they're able to inflame that
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:37.480]  chuck balton and these radical constitutional conservatives are coming
[02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:41.480]  in to take over montana and you know to a certain extent
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:44.360]  yeah we want to take over in the name of liberty
[02:47:44.360 --> 02:47:49.000]  but the establishment uses that to gain fear i don't think montanans will be
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:52.040]  stupid though i mean i think they're not going to buy that
[02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:57.240]  well we can't it's not unilith uh you know there is that old mining liberal
[02:47:57.240 --> 02:48:01.480]  corrupt mentality in montana as well and there is the typical apathetic
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:06.440]  majority which can be talked in to demonizing someone as good as chuck
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:09.400]  balton i'm not saying the cause is lost i'm just
[02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:13.560]  saying you have to be very very careful not to wave the old liberty flag
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:17.720]  in saying we're going to take over because it backfires but i think during war
[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:21.160]  what's going to happen is we are going to have pockets of liberty people are
[02:48:21.160 --> 02:48:24.360]  going to be driven out of the major cities there's no job to keep them
[02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:26.280]  this well it's already happening i mean i go to the
[02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:29.160]  store now and it's going back to land going back to the
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:32.120]  frontier that those magazines are everywhere and people
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:35.960]  instinctively are buying guns and getting ready and racing to the countryside
[02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:39.560]  even if it's in a half-azard way that's why strategic relocation available in
[02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:43.160]  infowars.com third edition just out is so important and
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:46.680]  the video uh just type in secrets of survival jules calson
[02:48:46.680 --> 02:48:49.720]  to watch the hour and a half presentation it's free online folks and very
[02:48:49.720 --> 02:48:53.720]  important jules here by the way to take like a two-hour special report to
[02:48:53.720 --> 02:48:57.000]  really get into it for folks because this is so important it'll be out for
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:00.280]  everybody in a few months here but y'all we're about to go to break we're
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:04.520]  we're running out of time here how will it add to things that we've been here
[02:49:04.520 --> 02:49:08.120]  beforehand warning and that millions of guns you know it was a
[02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:11.800]  million a month and two million one month four five million i mean
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:15.960]  people are really police military they all are really starting to wake up
[02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:19.560]  it helps alex because people are getting preconditioned and they're thinking
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:23.720]  of where safe places are so that when and they're not moving most people aren't
[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:26.600]  moving because they're stuck with their jobs in the big city but when those are
[02:49:26.600 --> 02:49:30.840]  destroyed when social unrest comes and drives them out the job is no longer
[02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:33.880]  holding the back and neither is family neither is climate
[02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:38.120]  they only think where were those cities that alex talked about that were safe
[02:49:38.120 --> 02:49:42.840]  and they're going to start to migrate on foot on car by hook and by crook
[02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:46.760]  you're going to find a movement of people consolidating together and we're
[02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:49.960]  going to end up with majorities of liberty minded people in areas that will
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:54.440]  be able to resist this new world order that they're putting upon us
[02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:58.360]  well i mean what about being able to reverse this if enough people wake up
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:01.400]  to what's happening because i know the globalist are digging in for some type
[02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:05.640]  of mega death scenario but it has to be reversed in pocket what about the
[02:50:05.640 --> 02:50:09.400]  globalist just releasing race specific bio weapons like cheney talked about i
[02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:12.360]  mean i agree the scenario you talked about the evidence is there
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:15.000]  that's what the evidence shows and i know you've got some documents that back a
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:18.120]  lot of it up but they've got it seems like they've got other scenarios in the
[02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:22.040]  background as well it's true but ultimately we have to depend on god
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:27.000]  balancing the the issue they could destroy as they have these weapons
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:31.160]  things but somehow you know he he doesn't help us an awful lot
[02:50:31.160 --> 02:50:35.240]  we are always fighting against a wall i think america is destined because of
[02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:38.920]  the sins and the evils of the people to take some tribulation
[02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:43.640]  a severe destruction but out of that there will be
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:47.400]  balance and i think the lord's gonna manage that to keep
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:51.960]  me has to buy his own principles to allow that's what happens in history over
[02:50:51.960 --> 02:50:56.280]  and over again final segment with joe scousen straight ahead
[02:50:56.280 --> 02:50:59.960]  i had tried everything i'd cut back the amount of food i was eating i was
[02:50:59.960 --> 02:51:02.840]  lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working
[02:51:02.840 --> 02:51:06.680]  my body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as
[02:51:06.680 --> 02:51:11.640]  key vitamins and as soon as i had that i immediately could eat half of what i
[02:51:11.640 --> 02:51:15.720]  was eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great

[02:54:33.800 --> 02:54:36.360]  think about all this because the elites are all digging in
[02:54:36.360 --> 02:54:38.760]  like it is going to be the end of the world and i assure you it's not the
[02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:42.760]  Mayan calendar it's not cabler elves on a planet x coming to
[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:47.000]  get us it is nuclear war chemical biological
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:51.560]  they're not building seed vaults and dna vaults with you know guards and things
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:55.720]  for no reason and i got dick cheney and i was
[02:54:55.720 --> 02:54:58.760]  talking about how they need to use ray specific bio weapons this is
[02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:03.000]  this is serious and it needs to be discussed it needs to be
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:08.680]  talked about also a dhs to release bacteria in boston subway system
[02:55:08.680 --> 02:55:13.320]  that's the top story at info wars dot com that is extremely
[02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:16.680]  important you've got all these martial law drills but i don't see it as one
[02:55:16.680 --> 02:55:20.920]  big martial law they're just phasing it in getting everybody
[02:55:20.920 --> 02:55:24.920]  accustomed to a soft martial law and pretty soon you're in a hard
[02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:26.840]  martial law do you agree with that statement
[02:55:26.840 --> 02:55:30.120]  absolutely this chicago thing nato summit they're
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:33.800]  at once fomenting it they're probably going to move in protesters just so
[02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:36.840]  that they can justify then they attack peaceful people inside of them
[02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:39.640]  you know that's right then for the first time they're going to start moving
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:43.960]  people out prior to it and say you're either quarantine here or you leave
[02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:47.000]  yeah they said at first it started the area right around now they're saying
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:50.920]  more you got to go yeah and so they're getting ready to really
[02:55:50.920 --> 02:55:54.680]  get people used to having government come in and dictate where you will be
[02:55:54.680 --> 02:55:58.280]  how you will move and when you will move it's a very very bad precedent but i
[02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:02.040]  agree with you it's not going to mean martial law is imminent across the
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:05.480]  united states these are pockets these are practice martial law
[02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:08.840]  they don't even have enough manpower to do a nationwide martial law you won't
[02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:12.360]  see that till war comes in my opinion yeah they're just beta testing but
[02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:15.480]  then you've got like oh you can't leave the country of the irs so
[02:56:15.480 --> 02:56:19.960]  exactly unprecedented tyranny but not internationally we saw that happen in
[02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:23.720]  south africa when it was clamping down the a and c took over suddenly don't
[02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:26.600]  let the whites leave or at least if they want to leave don't let them take their
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:31.480]  money same thing happened to rhodesia zimbabwe currency controls
[02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:35.720]  we're starting to see that in terms of tax evasion tax laws as the excuse for
[02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:40.040]  that but it's they're aiming on making sure nobody can escape the country
[02:56:40.040 --> 02:56:45.720]  um to avoid what's coming wow but then you go to other countries when all this
[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:47.880]  happens it's going to be hellish there as well because
[02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:52.200]  all of this is the backdrop of the agenda 21 uh where they openly say they
[02:56:52.200 --> 02:56:55.240]  want to impoverish everybody yes a lot of people
[02:56:55.240 --> 02:56:59.320]  unfortunately think that the the nice expat community in costa rica's living
[02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:02.360]  high on the hog and cheap and therefore that's the solution
[02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:05.960]  they don't realize that those countries are also controlled by globalists if
[02:57:05.960 --> 02:57:09.160]  they say shut down the americans confiscate their bank accounts it's
[02:57:09.160 --> 02:57:11.880]  going to happen overnight and there are no legal protections and there's no
[02:57:11.880 --> 02:57:15.560]  resistance except the expats there and they're a tiny minority
[02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:17.640]  and you lived all over the world that's right
[02:57:17.640 --> 02:57:21.160]  i've lived in latin america and all of these countries and i can tell you
[02:57:21.160 --> 02:57:24.520]  there isn't anywhere in the world where you've got millions capable of
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:27.800]  resisting it but see that's what's sad i've studied history i've been in
[02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:31.720]  different parts of the world it's sad to be in a third world despotism
[02:57:31.720 --> 02:57:35.240]  with the police or thugs and to see our our system turning into that
[02:57:35.240 --> 02:57:38.920]  it's painful to watch and this is a very important change that you mentioned
[02:57:38.920 --> 02:57:44.760]  the the the transition to thugs uh william greg junior documents every
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:47.800]  single week what i have a file i'm just building a
[02:57:47.800 --> 02:57:51.400]  file from his and many others called bad cops and it's just getting
[02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:55.640]  epidemic the amount of x military type shaved heads
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:57:59.080]  overweight but thuggish in their mentality and just
[02:57:59.080 --> 02:58:03.640]  reaping you know terrible injustices on people and the judges are backing them
[02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:07.080]  up normally you would think you take these people you have them filmed you
[02:58:07.080 --> 02:58:10.600]  have them recorded to take it to court they just throw that evidence out the
[02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:14.120]  judges are protecting thuggish behavior and that's so
[02:58:14.120 --> 02:58:18.040]  that there are no penalties so that you can continue to attract
[02:58:18.040 --> 02:58:21.880]  people of that mentality that's the whole thing about why they hired mercenaries
[02:58:21.880 --> 02:58:26.600]  at much greater cost to replace us military they're building the future thugs
[02:58:26.600 --> 02:58:30.280]  that will take down america well said joe well said we're going to do a two hour
[02:58:30.280 --> 02:58:37.560]  special on all of this it's so important
