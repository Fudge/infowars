[00:00.000 --> 00:17.040]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report it's alex jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:46.080]  why do i have a case of bottled water here i'll tell you about that after the break
[00:47.440 --> 00:50.800]  and i'm going to tell you the most important information you've ever heard in your life
[00:50.800 --> 00:56.080]  and that's not hype it is the most important information on the planet and we will break it
[00:56.080 --> 01:01.520]  all on the other side but first a key report america streets are mental institutions and it's
[01:01.520 --> 01:07.840]  because of this right here it's because of chemical and biological warfare it's now declassified
[01:07.840 --> 01:16.480]  against you stay with us there are over 550 000 homeless on the streets of america cities 36 000
[01:16.480 --> 01:23.680]  of those are youths 38 000 are veterans and 180 000 are families and if white privilege exists
[01:23.680 --> 01:29.680]  why is it that white americans are the largest racial group of homelessness making up 49 percent
[01:29.680 --> 01:35.520]  of those on the streets however things are tough all over as black americans and native americans
[01:35.520 --> 01:40.640]  numbers are high compared to their numbers in the general population and the homeless population
[01:40.640 --> 01:45.360]  is gradually increasing this is the worst i've ever seen it there are hundreds and hundreds of
[01:45.360 --> 01:51.280]  gang members and their associates hiding amongst the homeless the la pd says this video shows known
[01:51.280 --> 01:56.880]  gang members brutally beating a man add to this national crisis the stark reality that mental
[01:56.880 --> 02:02.800]  illness is rampant amongst the homeless because roughly 60 years ago the medical community and
[02:02.800 --> 02:08.720]  the federal government saw to it that long-term state mental institutions were closed in favor of
[02:08.720 --> 02:15.280]  community centers and a growing pharmaceutical industry stranglehold there are now 14 slots per
[02:15.280 --> 02:21.840]  100 000 people available for mental health treatment and private mental health facilities which don't
[02:21.840 --> 02:28.800]  accept insurance can cost upwards of 30 000 per month the mental health crisis has spilled out
[02:28.800 --> 02:35.600]  into our streets as a study published in the journal psychiatric services estimates 3.4
[02:35.600 --> 02:42.080]  percent of americans eight million americans suffer from serious psychological problems
[02:42.080 --> 02:47.760]  for example aditi saha says a homeless man threatened her with a knife back in july saha says
[02:47.760 --> 02:52.400]  her incident took place in just about 500 feet away from where this incident happened early
[02:52.400 --> 02:56.880]  sunday morning surveillance cameras were rolling when a woman was attacked by a homeless man
[02:56.880 --> 03:02.160]  out front of her luxury high-rise 25-year-old austin vincent was arrested and now released
[03:02.160 --> 03:06.560]  by the court pending trial she tweeted governor gavin knew some wednesday night attached the
[03:06.560 --> 03:12.560]  video for attack for him to see then asked the governor to save san francisco i don't feel safe
[03:12.560 --> 03:18.320]  i know that we're all at risk especially when this thing opens up i mean think about it 250
[03:18.320 --> 03:24.000]  new people new homeless people that god knows who they are what what they struggle with whether it's
[03:24.000 --> 03:32.160]  drugs or mental illness and all the city is providing as a shelter no treatment no security
[03:32.160 --> 03:38.800]  no proper planning just a shelter president trump has brought awareness to what many have
[03:38.800 --> 03:45.760]  ignored for too long i was talking about mental institutions they closed so many at like 92 percent
[03:46.320 --> 03:52.960]  of the mental institutions around this country over the years for budgetary reasons these are
[03:52.960 --> 03:59.280]  people that have to be in institutions for help i'm not talking about as a form of a prison i'm
[03:59.280 --> 04:05.760]  saying for help and i think it's something we have to really look at the whole concept of mental
[04:05.760 --> 04:12.240]  institutions i remember growing up we had mental institutions then they were closed in new york
[04:12.240 --> 04:17.600]  i'm talking about there were many of them were closed a lot of them were closed and all of those
[04:17.600 --> 04:22.640]  people were put out on the streets and i said even as a young guy i said how does that work that's
[04:22.640 --> 04:28.000]  not a good thing but liberals are only happy to cheerlead the despair if it means they will increase
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.520]  their own power in the words of thomas jefferson if the american people ever allow private banks
[04:33.520 --> 04:39.280]  to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and
[04:39.280 --> 04:44.320]  corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all of their property until
[04:44.320 --> 04:49.920]  their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered john bound reporting
[04:49.920 --> 04:58.160]  now learn the declassified plan to literally murder you and your family slowly
[04:59.200 --> 05:03.360]  gobert barnes what does big tech become a big tech are big babies that have become big bullies
[05:03.360 --> 05:07.440]  and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or
[05:07.440 --> 05:11.600]  legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts
[05:11.600 --> 05:15.360]  the judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the
[05:15.360 --> 05:19.120]  ordinary members of the public in the audience that care about this has to bring real social
[05:19.120 --> 05:23.280]  political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change
[05:23.280 --> 05:27.280]  and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[05:27.280 --> 05:31.600]  who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to
[05:31.600 --> 05:36.400]  recover after the great depression the informer's audience is the fuel that flames the the light
[05:36.400 --> 05:41.520]  of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real
[05:41.520 --> 05:45.840]  the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[05:45.840 --> 05:49.840]  manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake
[05:49.840 --> 05:53.600]  people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the
[05:53.600 --> 05:57.920]  ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you
[05:57.920 --> 06:18.640]  just thought live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[06:18.640 --> 06:33.040]  ladies and gentlemen we are broadcasting worldwide on this august 20th 2019 broadcast
[06:34.160 --> 06:37.520]  and i've been talking the last few weeks about the accelerated global away cutting
[06:38.240 --> 06:44.560]  that's taking place and the fact that basically everything that we've trailblazed breaking down
[06:44.560 --> 06:54.640]  on is now being admitted and it's now coming out in triplicate if you took your six month old baby
[06:55.280 --> 07:00.320]  and dropped it on its head on purpose you would lose that child if you were seen doing it and
[07:00.320 --> 07:07.120]  you should if you took your child in to have a partial lobotomy done they would arrest the doctors
[07:07.120 --> 07:14.800]  that tried to do it and arrest you but if you give that child gender-bending chemicals
[07:17.200 --> 07:23.440]  that also lower their IQ and lower their fertility and then take them in at age eight to have their
[07:23.440 --> 07:29.680]  genitals cut off you're called a trendy cutting-edge person this is all part of transhumanism how do i
[07:29.680 --> 07:42.240]  know the taba stock institute the carney endowment the schenarian institutes they have all admitted
[07:42.240 --> 07:56.400]  the plan we got a rear end game 2.0 which was just a talk with the late great professor michael
[07:56.400 --> 08:03.360]  kothman going over 1960 documents for this whole plan first the sexual revolution so people wouldn't
[08:03.360 --> 08:08.080]  take care of their kids so they run off and leave their husband or wife then once you broke up the
[08:08.080 --> 08:13.600]  family then you start giving chemicals to the children to confuse their sexual
[08:13.600 --> 08:25.440]  proclivities towards depopulation now i talk about awakening points i've gotten no exaggeration
[08:26.560 --> 08:32.400]  i don't 20 phone calls or more to my personal cell phone that's really a robot government
[08:32.400 --> 08:38.160]  tracking device it's a trojan horse given to me given to us all but let's define things as they are
[08:38.160 --> 08:43.920]  and and just flooding in emails and calls and everyone breathlessly the journal of american
[08:45.040 --> 08:50.000]  medicine and harvard they all just came out and said you got to take the floor out of the water
[08:50.000 --> 09:02.640]  it's lowering IQs massively oh and it's double worse with men boys and quadruple worse with blacks
[09:02.640 --> 09:09.600]  now folks if you're wondering why it's like a zombie apocalypse out there and why there's
[09:09.600 --> 09:17.120]  mental illness everywhere and why people seem so incredibly stupid it's because the soviets
[09:18.160 --> 09:26.960]  the communist the proto globalist a globalist that took over had work camps and they put
[09:26.960 --> 09:35.840]  hydrofluorosalic acid in the water and lots of other stuff to test it on the people in the gulags
[09:36.640 --> 09:40.960]  and the gulags archipelago and that's a bullet surprise winning history books
[09:42.240 --> 09:46.320]  at the before war war two started at the very beginning there was an alliance between
[09:46.960 --> 09:53.840]  russia and the nazis and they exchanged information and the nazis put hydrofluorosalic acid
[09:53.840 --> 10:01.920]  in the water that came out in nuremberg because it made people docile now
[10:04.400 --> 10:08.960]  i went to h e b this morning the crew did walked right in it says h e b
[10:10.880 --> 10:18.400]  baby fluoride water let's zoom right in on that and notice it shows you the target it's kind of
[10:18.400 --> 10:28.640]  like buying a box of 30 odd six rifle shells rifle rounds and on the covers a deer and there's a
[10:28.640 --> 10:35.040]  little crosshair on the side of the deer or if you go by a cockroach poison a lot of it
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.040]  is fluoride by the way and it'll show the cockroach on the front with a target on or if
[10:41.040 --> 10:48.960]  you're getting stuff to kill wasp it'll show a target on wasp right well right here the h e b
[10:50.160 --> 10:58.240]  fluoride added water for your boy it's nothing but a box of rifle shells firing
[10:58.240 --> 11:09.600]  electrified molecules of weaponized fluoride into the brain but let me give you the rest of story
[11:12.480 --> 11:15.760]  everybody when they did this in the 40s and knew it was going on so they freaked out about it
[11:16.560 --> 11:22.240]  because everybody knew that mainline poison you sprinkled around the house was just standard
[11:22.240 --> 11:30.320]  fluoride well you're gonna put electrified fluoride fluorides would turn into a psychoactive acid but
[11:30.320 --> 11:35.120]  there's more then they don't have to put as many of the other chemicals in they're putting all sorts
[11:35.120 --> 11:40.720]  of drugs in the water and there's waivers in the clean water act there's waivers in prop 65 in
[11:40.720 --> 11:46.400]  california where you can't have one billionth of lead in your product i mean the air has more than
[11:46.400 --> 11:52.480]  that so the lawyers can sue you but if you want to dump hydro fluorescent acid and other grignard
[11:52.480 --> 11:59.200]  reagents because there's a waiver to 400 plus chemicals in it's good so they dump the toxic
[11:59.200 --> 12:05.760]  waste in the water and all the leftist religiously filter their water they don't shower in it it's for
[12:05.760 --> 12:16.080]  you it's for me and it's for boys now we've covered this probably it's not exaggerate a thousand times
[12:16.080 --> 12:27.760]  over the last 20 years on here and it comes out in a major study in jamma the most prestigious
[12:27.760 --> 12:34.560]  there is in quadruple blind studies over years and they show exactly what the japanese the chinese
[12:34.560 --> 12:43.520]  the mexican the brazilian the german studies show massive cancer increases massive bone cancer
[12:43.520 --> 12:52.240]  massive infertility massive iq reductions four times in a black male what it is in a white woman
[12:53.680 --> 13:03.600]  now why is that because men don't have blood brain barriers as strong as women any physician will
[13:03.600 --> 13:11.920]  tell you going back five thousand years that women babies are twice as strong as male babies
[13:11.920 --> 13:17.120]  when it comes to the injuries women can take more bullet holes more blood loss all of it we're
[13:17.120 --> 13:21.920]  designed different because they're meant to be able to carry a baby and then have that traumatic
[13:21.920 --> 13:27.920]  event happen women are tough not in the physical ways we are but in the other ways to survive
[13:28.960 --> 13:35.360]  on less food less water everything this hurts women it hurts them bad but boy you talk about
[13:35.360 --> 13:43.760]  black lives matter baby can you imagine what it's like to be black and to have drunk this when you
[13:43.760 --> 13:51.120]  were a child they're talking about a 40 point iq reduction mental retardation in most people if
[13:51.120 --> 13:57.280]  you're gonna have 140 iq you have 100 if you were gonna have 100 you are going to be mentally
[13:57.280 --> 14:04.640]  retarded below 70 unable to tie your shoelaces now that's all in the studies i don't just have
[14:04.640 --> 14:12.000]  the new one i've got a whole bunch of them it's a fact and it was done on purpose and we take it
[14:12.000 --> 14:24.800]  now let me give you the next big piece of the enchilada 5g is fluoride 2.0 5g literally destroys
[14:24.800 --> 14:31.680]  the cells in the body vibrating at a perfect frequency to break molecules in half you know
[14:31.680 --> 14:38.240]  how you put a hot dog in the microwave for 30 seconds and it pumps up and does all that all the
[14:38.240 --> 14:44.240]  studies show that regular cell phone radiation heats the brain one degree after 15 minutes of
[14:44.240 --> 14:51.520]  cell use if you have it up your head oh it's killing but slowly like leaving a grilled cheese
[14:51.520 --> 14:59.040]  on all day but finally gets delicious so remember these are all bullets right here now if i took a
[14:59.040 --> 15:05.360]  baby in here i would never do that put it to crib right there and if i threw bottles of this chemical
[15:05.360 --> 15:10.720]  weapon at it they'd arrest me i was just throwing at the baby of course that really wouldn't hit
[15:10.720 --> 15:16.640]  hurt the baby maybe scratch it but it'd be wrong but if mommy goes and gets it because it says it's
[15:16.640 --> 15:22.000]  for babies and i've got the studies for you they've been trying to hedge their bets the last decade
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.400]  going well actually kids shouldn't drink fluoridated water before their teeth erupt it causes a dental
[15:26.400 --> 15:33.520]  fluorosis weakening of the enamel and chalking by the way my dad's a dentist and i got those studies
[15:33.520 --> 15:40.320]  i'm going to show you so you specifically shouldn't give it to a baby even if you think it's good for
[15:40.320 --> 15:46.560]  your teeth later which it's not it's a chemical weapon and it's pulling on everywhere so you
[15:46.560 --> 15:54.320]  wonder why people are so dumb folks the average black man who was raised in a city with fluoridation
[15:54.320 --> 16:02.320]  has a 35 to 40 point lower attention gcn self-reliance listeners if you've ever wanted an emergency

[19:06.880 --> 19:11.680]  the ground close to reality who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation
[19:11.680 --> 19:17.920]  and today the communist chinese have banned all u.s farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive

[20:38.640 --> 20:46.240]  committee his chief science officer took direct orders from bill gates eco science you can pull
[20:46.240 --> 20:52.400]  it up online talks about fluoride in the water to lower your iq and to lower fertility and it calls
[20:52.400 --> 20:59.280]  for increasing it and boy have they and the iqs have gone straight down just like idiocracy but
[20:59.280 --> 21:06.640]  it didn't take 400 years it happened in just a few decades and now it's getting worse first they
[21:06.640 --> 21:14.400]  stun you with a soft kill so let me just tune in study prompts calls for lower fluoride consumption
[21:14.400 --> 21:22.320]  by pregnant women because massive iq reductions in boys particularly oh my goodness that's Reuters
[21:22.320 --> 21:27.760]  study links fluoridated water during pregnancy to lower iqs study links fluoridated water during
[21:27.760 --> 21:32.800]  pregnancy to lower iqs and here's a harvard study from eight years ago impact of fluoride on
[21:32.800 --> 21:37.520]  neurological development in children found the exact same thing got the studies out of mexico
[21:37.520 --> 21:45.520]  out of china oh oh but i've also got the study showing it hurts your teeth but let me show you
[21:45.520 --> 21:56.400]  this let me show you this if you're a tv viewer alex jones top 10 health claims and why they're wrong
[21:56.400 --> 22:04.640]  and when you read number five from forbs the fluoride in drinking water is making people dumb
[22:05.360 --> 22:10.960]  alex jones stated i grew up in dallas texas drinking sodium fluoridated water all the scientific
[22:10.960 --> 22:17.120]  studies show my iq has been reduced by at least 20 points yeah because they found in one of the
[22:17.120 --> 22:24.800]  harvard study six years of ingesting 1.3 parts per million lower iq on average about 10 points so
[22:24.800 --> 22:28.560]  you know i'm saying well i drank it longer than that so that's 20 points because it's cumulative
[22:29.120 --> 22:33.120]  of course they don't tell you i was showing the study on air they just go oh look they go on to
[22:33.120 --> 22:40.400]  say it's preposterous and ridiculous oh they use the word ridiculous well that proves that i'm
[22:40.400 --> 22:46.800]  this big liar they said i'm but wait they take the david hog statement and they say but jones
[22:46.800 --> 22:52.880]  sells water filters yeah it's like selling life jackets to people when they buy a boat
[22:52.880 --> 23:00.400]  or how you're going camping wants some uh bug spray to keep the bugs off of hey you got teeth
[23:00.400 --> 23:06.800]  i'm selling toothbrushes but oh it's a stamps yo we sell the highest rated water filters
[23:06.800 --> 23:13.280]  then for store.com it's what i use but oh i'm sorry let's go back to what they have at babies
[23:13.280 --> 23:18.720]  or rush and he being everywhere as whole aisles of the different oh fluoride for your baby and
[23:18.720 --> 23:26.720]  then they've tested this this is way over 1.3 so you get real brain cooking with this it's for your
[23:26.720 --> 23:33.360]  baby and if you taste it here let me be a snake charmer here and drink poison bible says no weapon
[23:33.360 --> 23:37.440]  for me this will prosper unless they're targeting children they're unconscious and the years ago
[23:37.440 --> 23:48.080]  i tasted it tastes like houston water pumped out of a toilet oh i mean oh baby it's time to kill
[23:48.080 --> 23:55.920]  brain cells so document cam shot it would be much nicer to these babies you know that the
[23:55.920 --> 24:01.920]  left wants to kill in the womb or killed after they're born keeping comfortable uh too just
[24:01.920 --> 24:08.720]  basically put them in front of a firing squad but instead oh it's so much more fun so much more fun
[24:08.720 --> 24:18.000]  to take our time so much more fun to take our time and then it's bye bye brain and you've got
[24:18.640 --> 24:25.120]  a good automaton remember the movie was a good movie was a disney movie counter star wars 1978
[24:25.120 --> 24:32.960]  the black hole with maximillion shell and this mission to the black hole never came back and
[24:32.960 --> 24:38.960]  they get there and where's the crew oh they all died but they noticed that the robots have a limp
[24:38.960 --> 24:47.120]  look humanoid well they've given them lobotomies isn't that loving but see that that's a black hole
[24:47.120 --> 24:56.880]  movie that's scary oh my goodness but when it's done like mommy give them what they need and oh
[24:56.880 --> 25:02.800]  keep that alex jones off the air in china they work to filter the fluoride out of their water
[25:02.800 --> 25:08.320]  because it's naturally in their soil there it's a lot of our soil too but that's just the normal
[25:08.320 --> 25:15.040]  calcium fluoride and then they add iodine to the local reservoirs you can look at the videos online
[25:15.040 --> 25:21.520]  they'll have tanks depending on the size of the lake or the pond the water container with with a
[25:21.520 --> 25:28.960]  big tank that puts fluoride in oh but alex jones is bad too he sells good iodine don't listen to him
[25:28.960 --> 25:35.440]  because it's the good halogen not the bad one oh and one of our great crew members uh added this
[25:35.440 --> 25:40.000]  point he's he's a big swimmer and a big health aficionado and conard was you're telling me earlier
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.600]  he goes you know it's funny how about women having twice as good a blood brain barrier that's why the
[25:43.600 --> 25:47.040]  toxins don't hurt them as bad it's because they have this particular chemical in it and he goes
[25:47.040 --> 25:51.520]  and i was reading in a major medical journal that that's what krill oil is and why it's so important
[25:51.520 --> 25:59.680]  to boost iq my 27 month old daughter this morning was looking at a book and it had an american eagle
[25:59.680 --> 26:08.160]  in it and she pointed out it said that's the hero and my wife said what does that mean and she
[26:08.160 --> 26:13.600]  pointed it means his daddy she's never watched the show any of that she's like a martian head
[26:13.600 --> 26:19.040]  in the hundred percentile walking around people think she's five years old in fact i think my
[26:19.040 --> 26:23.680]  wife's gonna let me bring her on here because you got he's phenomenal and everybody loves their
[26:23.680 --> 26:28.720]  kids i'll tell you this all my kids you've seen racks and he's a piece of work as well but i'm
[26:28.720 --> 26:34.960]  telling you this little cupcake and she's been getting fish oil since she was a week old the purest
[26:34.960 --> 26:42.000]  best in her little bottles it now goes in her cups i just prick the krill oil put a half a dose in
[26:42.000 --> 26:50.320]  there and boy she's on fire and so yes i do sell ultimate krill oil as well or you can just listen
[26:50.320 --> 26:55.120]  to the new world order and you could do whatever they tell you do we ever get the david hog queued up
[26:57.120 --> 27:01.600]  we have it so here's david hog though and here's four of the talking point is this man is so evil
[27:02.480 --> 27:06.320]  that he tells you there's radioactive isotopes in most of water and there's hundreds of chemicals
[27:06.320 --> 27:11.520]  on average and glyphosate that grows breast cancer it's miracle grow for breast cancer it
[27:11.520 --> 27:17.920]  literally does it mimics the hormone that makes the cancer grow oh oh and i found another article
[27:17.920 --> 27:24.320]  where frogs are raping other male frogs but also uh boa constrictors in fact i sent you guys that
[27:24.320 --> 27:29.120]  article maybe we'll find it during the break but it is attacking everyone because of the
[27:29.120 --> 27:35.600]  atrazine running off that's mainstream news oh but david hog says i'm mad see no no no drink it
[27:35.600 --> 27:40.000]  don't filter it and it's really don't support someone that exposes it don't buy your filters
[27:40.000 --> 27:48.800]  from him let him go bankrupt shout him up here's david hog uh getting um saying alex joke sorry i
[27:48.800 --> 27:53.280]  i want to mention his name um when individuals say these things to us i think it's important for

[28:18.400 --> 28:22.800]  one of the main things that he spoke one of his famous things is saying that uh one of his most
[28:22.800 --> 28:27.680]  famous statements was saying that tap water is turning the frogs gay and will turn you gay too

[31:12.400 --> 31:18.560]  communist chinese have banned all u.s. farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases
[31:18.560 --> 31:24.160]  in polls support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once china put pressure
[31:24.160 --> 31:29.840]  on our farmers that's beautiful americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down

[32:33.120 --> 32:39.440]  incredibly high quality mellocobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula ultra 12
[32:39.440 --> 32:44.640]  ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest highest quality b12 over the counter that you're going

[32:56.720 --> 33:04.320]  eight two five three three one three nine you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:15.440 --> 33:21.680]  devastating globalist lies exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine
[33:21.680 --> 33:29.360]  tirelessly waging war on corruption from deep in the heart of fema region six in austin texas
[33:29.920 --> 33:38.480]  transmitting worldwide it's alex jones if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[33:42.480 --> 33:48.320]  i don't know about you but i'm angry that i read this book written 45 years ago when i was born
[33:48.320 --> 33:56.240]  by the later white house science are john p holdren saying that they put the floor
[33:56.240 --> 34:01.120]  out in the water to lower our cues and fertility because of course one of the most studied compounds
[34:02.320 --> 34:08.880]  elements out there and then everybody's calling me oh my gosh roiders ap study prompts calls for
[34:08.880 --> 34:14.400]  lower fluoride consumption by pregnant women massive iq reductions in boys particularly
[34:14.400 --> 34:18.400]  because the blood brain barrier being weaker the daily b study links fluoride water during pregnancy
[34:18.400 --> 34:25.520]  to lower iqs study links fluoride water during pregnancy to lower iqs you know you've got moms
[34:25.520 --> 34:31.280]  making their boys transgender how about trans lobotomies because there are people that burn their
[34:31.280 --> 34:37.520]  eyes out with a drano to be trans abled uh moms already give their boys riddling to stunt their
[34:37.520 --> 34:43.200]  iq and teach them how to behave they already tell them to chop their genitals off so how about more
[34:43.200 --> 34:50.160]  fluoride for that baby boy study links fluoride water during pregnancy to lower iqs another story
[34:50.160 --> 34:54.160]  oh another one this is from eight years ago impact the florida neurological development
[34:54.160 --> 35:01.200]  children harvard study massive iq reductions but the best parts the bone cancer and the infertility
[35:02.080 --> 35:07.840]  and you look how the iq in the us is dropping the fastest in the world major studies on that
[35:07.840 --> 35:13.200]  oh but forbes came out and they said i'm a cook and we can put this article up on screen may put
[35:13.200 --> 35:18.720]  the color version up so folks can see it kind of blurs out there there you go horny confused cane
[35:18.720 --> 35:28.160]  codes are humping a python biologist say it's atrazine runoff causes them to well the males to
[35:29.120 --> 35:34.880]  only have sex with other males and then to rape other animals there you go but again
[35:34.880 --> 35:39.120]  i'm the bad guy for just telling you what was in mainline studies decades ago and here you've
[35:39.120 --> 35:46.880]  got it right here fluoride water for your babies and after gabin again this leaves us i will get to
[35:46.880 --> 35:54.800]  the uh other studies uh on that for you about how you shouldn't have any fluoride until your teeth
[35:54.800 --> 35:59.040]  come in because it causes dental fluorosis and the development of the bones and makes the teeth
[35:59.040 --> 36:05.600]  brittle but that's okay oh it's baby with fluoride we're going to cover and there's all this colgate
[36:05.600 --> 36:10.800]  with the fluoride in it for your kids and you wonder why they get so stupid of course you might
[36:10.800 --> 36:15.600]  want to go to info or store dot com and fund the operation to warn people while protecting yourself
[36:15.600 --> 36:19.920]  with ultimate krill oil that the major studies say is the only thing that increases the blood
[36:19.920 --> 36:26.880]  brain barrier oh don't want junior taking that don't want to put any of that in the babies milk
[36:26.880 --> 36:33.840]  because you'll have a brainiac the giant brain now joining us is gabin again so i appreciate
[36:33.840 --> 36:40.560]  him coming on on short notice uh mom of three arrested jailed for putting recycling in wrong
[36:40.560 --> 36:44.560]  color bag that's up on drugs report dot com just to show you how they're going after the good guys

[36:54.320 --> 36:58.160]  there speaking and became to shut it down we've seen all the footage antifa attacks them but for
[36:58.160 --> 37:04.240]  the crime of fighting back against the methods well they've been convicted they've been railroaded
[37:04.240 --> 37:08.240]  and we'll show some of the footage that night of the uh proud boys being attacked first you saw
[37:08.240 --> 37:14.800]  the proud boys carry out a very peaceful operation in portland led by joe biggs and others uh but the
[37:14.800 --> 37:19.440]  media tried to ignore that but ap got it right they said that the proud boys were peaceful and
[37:19.440 --> 37:25.040]  that antifa was violent even after they left attacking little girls so but that's just part
[37:25.040 --> 37:29.120]  of the club tack kids brains with fluoride why not they know exactly what they're doing gabin
[37:29.120 --> 37:37.360]  again is thanks for coming on my friend well anytime to talk to you well wow uh break down

[39:08.560 --> 39:12.640]  i've watched all the footage all of it's on tape they get followed they get attacked and for fighting
[39:12.640 --> 39:19.680]  back now they're gonna go to prison one of them is already in rikers jeff uh my buddy jeff is um
[39:20.400 --> 39:27.200]  i forget his last name uh he's in rikers right now he's doing weekend and he said to me that the
[39:27.200 --> 39:32.000]  other prisoners there at rikers go what the hell are you doing here and the corrections officers
[39:32.000 --> 39:37.840]  are getting in all this story and they go what were you supposed to do tell me what you do when
[39:37.840 --> 39:44.160]  you there the antifa draws a line in the stand throws a bottle of urine at you after days and
[39:44.160 --> 39:50.880]  days of pair and says we are not civil we are going to destroy you and then they get ambushed
[39:50.880 --> 39:54.640]  should they just sit there and take the beating because that's what the court said yesterday
[39:54.640 --> 40:01.200]  take a beating and again we're showing footage from every angle of the cowardly method scum
[40:01.760 --> 40:06.080]  attacking and they didn't even show up obviously because they know uh they don't want their identities
[40:06.080 --> 40:12.560]  blown so for fighting back against masked men they're now are facing 15 years in jail this is
[40:12.560 --> 40:19.360]  incredible it's an irrelevant fight too this is a silly if it was a brawl in hockey it wouldn't even
[40:19.360 --> 40:24.800]  register with the fan this was just a high school fight like you've seen a million times it was a
[40:24.800 --> 40:31.120]  little short skirmish i mean nobody got their ass handed to them it was like 17 seconds long
[40:31.120 --> 40:36.800]  there was no major injuries there was no blood anywhere it was just some guys jump a bunch of
[40:36.800 --> 40:42.000]  blue collar dudes who know how to fight the blue collar guys got caught back the the so-called
[40:42.000 --> 40:47.920]  victims said f you pig to the cop got said all right i guess you don't need my help and everyone
[40:47.920 --> 40:54.240]  went home it was only the next day after de Blasio and Cuomo and the attorney general started
[40:54.240 --> 40:59.200]  politicizing it then it became all this is more of trump's hate and they realized they could use
[40:59.200 --> 41:04.480]  that to leverage the midterm so they need to need that idea that oh this brown shirt paramilitary
[41:04.480 --> 41:08.880]  nazi force part of the epidemic of non-existent white supremacism that they're trying to gen up
[41:08.880 --> 41:14.560]  just another way to have those optics exactly the the the narrative is that these proud boys
[41:14.560 --> 41:20.000]  are roaming the streets like gorillas just looking for someone to pound looking for some
[41:20.000 --> 41:26.000]  muslims or some visible minorities to be or some trans people and that's completely and the truth
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.240]  is you were there the truth is you were literally there just having a speaking engagement they tried
[41:30.240 --> 41:38.320]  to shut down i did a funny comedy set where i was lamprooning uh this uh they had this this play
[41:38.320 --> 41:43.680]  where they murdered trump so we had a funny play where we re-enacted the assassination of this
[41:43.680 --> 41:48.880]  japanese socialist that otalia yamaguchi killed me in a plastic store and we did in slow motion
[41:48.880 --> 41:55.600]  it was hilarious but outside they were screaming follow your leader nine millimeter and all nazis
[41:55.600 --> 42:02.160]  must die and punch nazis terrorizing all the followers you know if these proud boys were gay
[42:02.160 --> 42:06.400]  and it was all about these gay guys who were being terrorized for days and then it would have been
[42:06.400 --> 42:10.880]  a national hate movement comes in assaults and does and death threats these people
[42:10.880 --> 42:17.280]  it would be if if the proud boys were gay then they would be on t-shirts right now and people
[42:17.280 --> 42:22.480]  would be going finally we're fighting back against the homophobes but because they're
[42:22.480 --> 42:28.560]  patriots because they're pro-trump then all the media lies become real in a court of law
[42:28.560 --> 42:34.640]  you know one thing they said in in court they said i called obama a monkey a total fabrication
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.760]  oh that happened in my custody battle that i ended up winning the medias they just showed
[42:39.760 --> 42:43.760]  some random thing on twitter about david duke i wasn't even involved i was five tweets down
[42:43.760 --> 42:48.800]  somebody else's tweet and and the jury just looked at me and just it was over but the judgment was
[42:48.800 --> 42:53.680]  all bs uh we'll be right back stay right there gabin again is one more segment i don't know where

[44:58.400 --> 45:05.040]  thomas jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future
[45:05.040 --> 45:10.080]  it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground close to reality who actually work for a living
[45:10.080 --> 45:14.800]  that would end up saving the nation and today the communist chinese have banned all u.s farming
[45:14.800 --> 45:20.960]  goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what he's
[45:20.960 --> 45:27.040]  doing in this trade war once china put pressure on our farmers that's beautiful americans aren't
[45:27.040 --> 45:32.400]  going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down so to the walking cruises and the hillary
[45:32.400 --> 45:36.400]  clinton's the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down we're never
[45:36.400 --> 45:40.960]  going to give up and all you've done is awaken the human spirit and the human spirit lives

[46:09.600 --> 46:14.880]  anymore if you have a corrupt media you don't have a democracy
[46:17.520 --> 46:21.840]  i don't think we've seen division like this in america since vietnam because it's a form of fascism
[46:22.640 --> 46:28.480]  the high court will examine free speech rights and social media multiple online platforms have
[46:28.480 --> 46:33.200]  now taken down content associated with alex jones and info wars
[46:33.200 --> 46:41.200]  first they come around which goes everyone else like dominoes would fall
[46:49.280 --> 46:50.640]  we're not in kansas anymore
[46:53.280 --> 46:58.000]  you can't watch this the movie available now at info wars store dot com
[46:58.000 --> 47:06.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:19.840 --> 47:24.640]  body through friday from 11 a.m to 3 p.m central i'm here live david knights on right the
[47:24.640 --> 47:30.160]  for me in the morning the david knights show we're a great job of course oh and shroyer
[47:30.160 --> 47:34.480]  and the war room will johnson's here visiting sitting in forum doing an excellent job as well
[47:36.240 --> 47:40.400]  i said i take a bunch of calls you're staying i didn't i took some i tend to open the phones up
[47:40.400 --> 47:44.640]  with all this other news and whatever you want to cover talk about in the next hour
[47:44.640 --> 47:50.800]  into the third and fourth hour joey gibson the patriot pair breakfast was there in portland
[47:50.800 --> 47:55.120]  he's gonna pop in give us a report on that and respond to this because this is a real
[47:55.120 --> 48:02.000]  miscarriage of justice i followed the buildup the charges i went and watched dozens of videos
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.640]  because people are you know coming out of the club after the event so there's all these angles
[48:07.280 --> 48:11.440]  of them being followed down the street as soon as the police break off in their protective detail
[48:12.400 --> 48:18.000]  a mob of people attack with clubs and bottles and they get their ass kicked because again
[48:18.000 --> 48:23.920]  they're methhead professors they are you know acid head devil worshipers that they
[48:25.360 --> 48:32.800]  they are government employees the bad ones and they are also members of the media and they come
[48:32.800 --> 48:37.440]  out and wear a mask and they want to get their bones they want to get some blood they want to
[48:39.600 --> 48:44.000]  go out there and become real men fighting nazis in fact i never got to it yesterday
[48:44.000 --> 48:50.240]  maybe we can pull it up but uh the headline was democrat fundraiser forced to apologize
[48:50.240 --> 48:57.440]  for simulating trump's murder and it was a bunch of full grown men dressed up in superhero outfits
[48:57.440 --> 49:04.640]  like they were the avengers taking on trump and simulating killing him and when i was at
[49:04.640 --> 49:08.480]  san diego i had some leftist walked by my table bow up and think about saying something he was like
[49:08.480 --> 49:16.720]  a 60 year old man wearing a deadpool shirt saying with an arrow to himself saying i've got issues
[49:16.720 --> 49:21.040]  hey dude because you're wearing a deadpool shirt doesn't mean you're the fictional character
[49:22.240 --> 49:25.920]  and all you're gonna get your neck broken if you put your hands on me but these people live
[49:25.920 --> 49:30.560]  in fantasy land and so they're letting you know these jurisdictions we're gonna follow you we're
[49:30.560 --> 49:36.480]  gonna attack you and then our jurisdiction is gonna put you in prison when groups that say
[49:36.480 --> 49:41.920]  they want to kill the police and have attacked ice facilities and the date and shooter all of it
[49:41.920 --> 49:49.440]  the guy in texas antifa they changed all his pages that they got that hoax over on us so gabin again
[49:49.440 --> 49:54.240]  is joins us uh hosting his own program he's been banned everywhere like us except on his own platform
[49:54.240 --> 49:57.360]  we'll take out a go there in a moment because remember the internet's still alive it's still
[49:57.360 --> 50:03.200]  here we have to decentralize it as drudge is warned and it's starting to happen uh but a lot
[50:03.200 --> 50:07.360]  of my crews are really upset they're really threatened by this because to see the injustice
[50:07.360 --> 50:14.160]  to see people hounded and bullied and attacked and then convicted by this servile jury it really
[50:14.160 --> 50:20.640]  shows you in these leftist jurisdictions you cannot get justice so where's it going gabin
[50:22.560 --> 50:29.680]  i mean i don't know it's it's the opposite is always true you know what i mean like they say
[50:29.680 --> 50:35.360]  we're anti fascists right and we're against the government and we're gonna go fight these fascists
[50:36.160 --> 50:40.400]  because they're nazis because they're full of hate and you go okay that sounds good to me
[50:40.400 --> 50:46.160]  fight some nazis that sounds great but what really happened the antifa is the paramilitary
[50:46.160 --> 50:52.880]  wing of the dnc they are the government they are the establishment and they say okay go attack
[50:52.880 --> 50:58.320]  these trump supporters call them nazis or whatever you have to do and we'll let you get away with it
[50:58.320 --> 51:04.800]  scott free so they assault everyone no problems for antifa somehow they magically get lawyers no media
[51:04.800 --> 51:10.960]  attention at all for the antifa to attack that guy and then they take this alleged nazis the
[51:10.960 --> 51:16.000]  trump supporters and charge them with 15 years i mean they haven't been sentenced yet but they're
[51:16.000 --> 51:26.000]  facing 15 years for defending themselves against a mob so the fascists the tyranny is the left in
[51:26.000 --> 51:30.800]  this case and the patriots the guys supporting the president they're the ones being treated
[51:30.800 --> 51:35.440]  like anarchists they're the ones being treated like guy fox and you know we've got this one of the
[51:35.440 --> 51:42.080]  guys john he's got four black kids his wife's black and he's going to go to jail so these four
[51:42.080 --> 51:49.920]  black kids lose a father for 15 years basically the only years you need a father because of a lie
[51:49.920 --> 51:54.720]  a myth that the dnc is pushing and one other thing i want to add in there alex you're listening
[51:54.720 --> 52:00.480]  that they're all rich kids and professor's kids there's another group of antifa the the the mentally
[52:00.480 --> 52:07.280]  weak the the vulnerable they antifa and the dnc and these these globalists they prey on weak minded
[52:07.280 --> 52:13.040]  men like finbar slown him his father had just committed suicide two years earlier he was a red
[52:13.040 --> 52:18.800]  carpet guy and that's not that's a young man's game now so he got depressed and killed himself
[52:18.800 --> 52:24.400]  they see finbar they see him you know fatherless and weak and they go come on into our family
[52:24.400 --> 52:30.320]  all you'll have to do is commit some violence and you can repay the group it's really some it's like
[52:30.320 --> 52:38.000]  a sick cult well what it is is a violent street gang like the brown shirts and they actually work
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.880]  for someone who was working for hitler in the day of the brown shirts george soros i mean you cannot
[52:42.880 --> 52:49.120]  make up that their main financier made his first money working for the nazis as a bloodhounds what
[52:49.120 --> 52:54.640]  they called him a jew that would go find hidden jews and convince them to then set them up and
[52:54.640 --> 52:59.680]  send them to death camps and soros says on 60 minutes the best time of his life he said i had
[52:59.680 --> 53:06.800]  happy making and uh he's not sad for what he did and then i'm the nazi it's total mental illness
[53:06.800 --> 53:12.080]  and oh i forgot he's at this event with trump where they simulated killing trump this democrat
[53:12.080 --> 53:18.320]  event again they were dressed up like captain america battling red skull so they i've said that
[53:18.320 --> 53:22.480]  a hundred times like they think they're captain america battling red skull these people are crazy
[53:23.920 --> 53:29.120]  you know they call soros a holocaust survivor for those years the the media spin with that whole
[53:29.120 --> 53:34.640]  story is just incredible he's an atheist he hates all religion that includes judaism that includes
[53:34.640 --> 53:40.880]  christianity his father was an atheist his father hated judaism hey christian you're not jewish if
[53:40.880 --> 53:46.960]  you hate judaism so this has nothing to do with anti-semitism this has to do with a man who worked
[53:46.960 --> 53:52.400]  with the nazis but i think because we're intellectually lazy we're mentally obese these days
[53:52.400 --> 53:58.240]  that we're easy prey for these propagandists who just make up basically any story they want
[53:58.240 --> 54:04.560]  they vilify anyone they want and it works and it doesn't just work in the court of public opinion
[54:04.560 --> 54:12.000]  it works in actual criminal courts and again you're a really nice guy you're a famous
[54:12.000 --> 54:18.400]  kind of culture guy famous i'd call you kind of classical liberal or libertarian that's what the
[54:18.400 --> 54:21.360]  left really wants you banned it's because you've been so popular and launched a lot of movements
[54:21.360 --> 54:26.400]  launched vice they've done a lot of other things but they love just projecting this life so you
[54:26.400 --> 54:31.440]  come on my show and you go we're not nazis we're just into being proud of america and of course my
[54:31.440 --> 54:37.520]  audience knows that uh gab mckinnis but the larger issue is they're not gonna stop the new york times
[54:37.520 --> 54:42.560]  has announced well it leaked that they're gonna basically try to start a race war pivoting off
[54:42.560 --> 54:48.240]  of the russia hoax this is all very very cold-blooded how do we respond to a group trying to cause a
[54:48.240 --> 54:53.200]  race war i think we point out they're the social engineers creating the racism as poverty pimps
[54:53.200 --> 54:59.840]  i mean these are really really uh how much comic books these are like comic book villains
[55:01.440 --> 55:06.160]  we just keep fighting you know we've been through worse we've been through the civil war
[55:06.160 --> 55:12.400]  we've been through the american revolution we've been through vietnam totally polarized america
[55:12.400 --> 55:17.920]  and we fought through that and in truth you know the pendulum swings both ways and i think truth
[55:17.920 --> 55:25.760]  is on its way back these propagandists have no plan they say no border no wall no usa at all and i
[55:25.760 --> 55:31.600]  even heard a chant the other day that said from palestine to mexico all the walls have got to go
[55:31.600 --> 55:37.840]  so they don't want any borders at all in the entire world an idea like that much like facet
[55:37.840 --> 55:45.280]  fascism by the way can't gain any serious traction the nazis couldn't have lasted and these people
[55:45.280 --> 55:53.920]  won't last because tyranny tyrannical orthodoxy tyranny doesn't last freedom lasts that's right
[55:54.560 --> 56:01.120]  again and where do folks find your great daily programs they find me at free speech dot tv i'll
[56:01.120 --> 56:05.520]  be announcing we're gonna have to crowdfund for an appeal for these guys there's still another one
[56:05.520 --> 56:11.600]  by the way but he's east indian he's brown so that's not helping their narrative so that's one
[56:11.600 --> 56:16.160]  that one's delayed till december or something but we have to fight for an appeal for these guys
[56:16.160 --> 56:22.080]  it's just very difficult to set up a crowdfund because these antifa wasps swarm everything you
[56:22.080 --> 56:27.360]  do and constantly shut it down so every payment system has to have 10 different layers and offshore
[56:27.360 --> 56:31.760]  accounts and whatever just to raise money for legal representation exactly i don't think the
[56:31.760 --> 56:35.600]  listeners and viewers out there realize because we're not winers just how much attack we're under
[56:35.600 --> 56:40.880]  because we are the resistance gab mcginnis thank you so much talk to you soon thanks for having me

[56:45.760 --> 56:50.240]  to persecute nationalists because we're winning and we're going to win in the end but please you
[56:50.240 --> 56:55.200]  heard what he was just talking about i've got major lawsuits we've got a file to counter these
[56:55.200 --> 57:00.880]  people i want to just keep operating so i'm trying to expand the face of the globalist going into 2020
[57:00.880 --> 57:04.400]  and we're successfully reaching out to folks thanks to you spreading the word about the
[57:04.400 --> 57:08.400]  articles and the videos thanks to matt drudge linking to him thanks to folks supporting our

[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:06.960]  detailing a lot of this new york times to reframe american values in order to
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:12.080]  launch a race war here it is help us understand the genesis of this how long you've been thinking
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.800]  about this how long you've been thinking about changing our notions of the start of this country
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:24.560]  moving it from 1776 1776 to 1619 so i first came across the year the date 1619 as a high school
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.920]  student and i came across it in a book called uh before the mayflower and i just remembered
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.880]  as a student being astounded um because i had never thought that enslaved people that people
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:39.840]  of african descent had been here even before uh the pilgrims landed at plimits rock so i've
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:44.320]  i've been obsessed with it's not even true it was a spanish time and as the anniversary was
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:51.120]  approaching i really thought that this was an opportunity to to finally examine uh in an institution
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:56.560]  like the times gotta kick america around some more what it means to be a country that was founded um
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:02.400]  in slavery and where you know this is the 400th anniversary of the whole world had slavery then
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:09.520]  we look at the new york times we look at all cnn msnbc and they're just up there this is a white
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:15.120]  supremacist when he lowered flags because of the shooting in el pass so it was the heil hetler
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.240]  and you're just like this doesn't make sense it's targeting the dumbest people in the country
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:26.880]  and it's also creating hysteria where people think that if they don't jump on board with whatever
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:35.280]  the democrats say they're gonna be called racist that's the new religion that's the system of bullying
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:42.480]  that these people are inducting everyone into when someone is dividing the country with racist
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:49.920]  rhetoric and and saying things that are causing people to literally anger up and get into fights
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:56.160]  and act crazy and he's giving people a license to hate you gotta call it out otherwise what are
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:04.080]  you doing here so i think there are a lot of people in the republican base and trump's base
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:12.080]  and fox news's base that have a visceral reaction to the color of my scan you don't get to say i'm
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:18.560]  for racial equality and all these good things i disagree with them there but i like his economic
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:24.160]  views i'm gonna vote for no you own it you own the blood that happens it used to be well we're
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.600]  against illegal immigration but we're for legal immigration that was the party's historical
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:32.480]  stance now it looks increasingly like under down trump republican party's hostile towards all
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:39.120]  immigrants if you are supporting a president that is caging brown babies and you are okay with that
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:47.200]  then i'm sorry that is supporting racist policies and that is not distinct from supporting a racist
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:53.360]  president trump came out and lashed out at the new york times claiming it's going on a racism
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:04:03.760]  witch hunt now that the russia gate has failed no ladies and gentlemen that's not what he claims
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:12.080]  that's what they say but slate magazine is who got it and you read the transcript it is
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:20.320]  is unbelievable the head of the new york times says to the employees look russia didn't work
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:28.160]  he came up flat-footed these are quotes were pivoting to race to remove him from office
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:33.680]  they're the ones bringing up race they're the ones lying they're the ones dividing
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:39.520]  they're the ones doing all of this and then they've got the nerve to act like it's trump
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:43.360]  when he's done nothing but prison reform to get black people out of jail and
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:49.120]  tried to bring factories to the inner city but it's beyond a racism witch hunt they're trying
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:54.320]  to invoke a civil war stay with us critical intel straight ahead
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:02.160]  palik yes i got a plug for the patriot points i get oh thanks i got 180 dollars so far this year
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:06.240]  and i feel like i'm stealing from you i buy so much in the store because i mean i don't want to
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.360]  give that money to walmart i don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:13.280]  causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to you and i'm getting quality products the
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:18.080]  products that i do receive have changed my life i mean the x2 has really done a lot for me i've
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:22.800]  lost weight my brain works a whole lot better i think my kids they use the toothpaste my son used
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.200]  to get these little sore throats and he puts x2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:32.080]  throat uh let me break this down for you i want high quality stuff in there i want a good price
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.800]  but i've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50 off i'm making two
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:41.520]  dollars on the toothpaste 50 off and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:45.840]  bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen when people get the patriot points a lot
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.920]  of times it makes things a loss later because if you're already getting 10 off because you're on
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:54.400]  autoship then we're doing 50 off and then you do something like that uh we have patriot points
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:06:05.360]  we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:17.360]  i am burning inside burning the fire of living burning inside touch the stars
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:28.160]  from the front lines from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.160]  new world
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:05.600]  as i sit here on this live tuesday august 20th 2019 global transmission
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:20.240]  i have the 1974 blueprint a phd and above battle plan that was adopted on a planetary scale
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:28.400]  but the forces of the anglo-american establishment now that's the corporate designation has nothing
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:37.040]  to do with white people in the main but it is a racist anti-human project and so when you read
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:46.320]  a book written by the later white house science are a burak hussein obama john p holdren with paul
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:51.600]  ehrlich and annie ehrlich and you read about all their statements about forcibly depopulating the
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:59.760]  world and now compounds like fluoride should be used to reduce fertility that's sterilized
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:11.760]  statistically in the main reduce fertility reduce yields and then what else lower iq and
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:23.200]  increase morbidity you know when you have rick de mortis when you're bye bye
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.920]  we're gonna get to this in just a moment what you see on screen of your radio listener
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:32.960]  you probably want to go in and read the toothpaste in your house if you're a new listener
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:37.520]  and it's got a warning saying if you ingest more than a pea-sized amount of this
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:49.040]  fish call poison control immediately these things must be done delicately my little friend
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:59.440]  and i'll get you and your little kids too so the eugenicist call the general public bad sons
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:06.400]  bad sons you've got a crate myrtle or an oak tree actually the tree itself's roots throw up more
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:11.040]  but maybe you you don't want a bunch of trees i think that you just want to have pretty trees
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:18.160]  and well you go pull up the bad sons so real eugenics isn't trying to improve the race that's
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:28.240]  a parlor or porch or outer room to to recruit the low-level dumbbells to support it oh our
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:35.600]  movements to help people and all it is is a science project of the illuminate which is a real
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:40.320]  organization a real group check your psychopedia publicly oh wow type in george washington letters
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:45.280]  on the illuminati now he was battling it oh you didn't know he wrote like dozens of letters on the
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:52.640]  illuminati and luciferian organizations that his masonic order was battling it's not true that
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:58.160]  all the mason's serve lucifer but a movement that's taken over masonry in many respects when
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:06.080]  you become 33rd degree you learn all the secrets of lucifer and i i've made no secret of the fact
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.560]  that my family's founding members of texas and some of them were 33rd degree but they were christians
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:17.200]  and those are not the secrets you learn from those orders and i'll just leave it that now
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:26.640]  continuing ladies and gentlemen here we are with everybody calling me and just freaking out going
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:32.960]  oh my gosh the journal of american medicine and harvard they all just came out and they said take
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:39.120]  the floor out of the water it's causing massive brain damage massive infertility just it's devastating
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:45.120]  black people and yes we're all different we're all similar but we're all different
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:55.600]  and males have blood brain barriers up to 70% weaker than women's on general it's about half
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.640]  i've got all the studies i'll show them here right here and women have much stronger blood
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:03.680]  brain barriers because of what chemically goes on in their body we're men and women are different
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:10.080]  but black males just type in blacks and fluoride blacks suffer most from fluoride
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:19.360]  and that's the new american with a big link to studies but let me explain something that's at 1
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:26.880]  0.3 parts per million little over one part per million if you ingest
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.920]  the powdered eggs they were serving until the 60s in federal presence
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:41.840]  and on cheng gangs they were up to 600 parts per million being fed to prisoners
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:48.640]  you might want to learn about that now at that level ladies and gentlemen you're talking
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:56.080]  shutdown of the brain fertility's fried you might as well dip your testicles into uh
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:03.120]  acid might as well blow your head off at that point now if you look at what's in crest for
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:11.680]  children all of these it's not even listed what parts per million because it's the fluoride
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:17.920]  is in the parts per hundred it's so high that one of the main ingredients is fluoride
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:24.480]  hydrofluorosilic and it all tastes like candy for children you've got mickey mouse on the front
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:31.840]  that's what your kids into oh be a little mermaid who drools and is so stupid and has
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:37.200]  her whole future taken away from her it's all meant so your kids eat it oh and maybe your
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:43.600]  sons into velociraptors they think those are cute and all these are is like the vc would put like a
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.920]  cool doll or a cool ring or a cool samurai sword the japanese did this in island warfare as well
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.760]  and you know somebody that wasn't listening oh that's a cool looking sword you pull it well the
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:13:02.400]  kid sees it it's like oh mom i want that the this has got mickey mouse on it oh look mommy fluoride
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:10.720]  act oh fluoride oh it's all so good oh smart rinse that's a big joke you're gonna be real
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.600]  smart once we wrench your brain with this show at 1.3 parts per million i'm gonna show you
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.040]  mainstream studies right now everybody's freaking out over they're exactly what all the other
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:24.560]  studies showed a hundred years ago say it again the nazis used it in death camps
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:31.520]  that's in bullet surprise winning books but hell why listen to that i've got the science are
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:38.480]  saying increase it in our water to lower our iqs and dumbestown look it up eco science call for
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:44.880]  sterilization agents and water fluoride the chief might want to read it you know it's the
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.960]  odor's manual to screw up your life and make sure you're not a player in the future by dumbing you
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:57.200]  down they don't want you making decisions now we mean we know the education system's
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:02.480]  designed to dumb you down it's social control so here's the studies but let me hit some of these
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:12.000]  first us military pondered love not war bbc spraying chemicals on men to make them be
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.480]  attracted to the opposite sex no that's not what the headline is i'm having a Freudian slip
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:25.840]  to the same sex now think about that how do you do that well a lot of the sex is off olfactory
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:32.960]  nerves it's off smell and and other things that go on now let's continue that's bbc doesn't exist
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:38.960]  though they say jones is crazy says it was a gay bong the u.s military once proposed gay bong is moto
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.760]  document cam shot please so when we come back i'll get the number out to open the phones up

[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:01.680]  it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other thing
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:07.040]  that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:11.360]  corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:15.680]  funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an old
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:21.200]  school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.120]  of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:29.520]  they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:33.440]  the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:37.600]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:42.720]  manipulate what news and views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:47.360]  wars audience has broken through that the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to the
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.680]  modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:56.080]  onslaught of the platforming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:22.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:33.920]  we're here live weekdays 11 a.m to 3 p.m right before we come on there's david night
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:42.240]  live weekday mornings 8 a.m to 11 a.m and then 3 p.m o and shroyer and the war room
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:50.080]  so i get up here and i cover all this and i'm really extremely angry that i've been
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:55.920]  sarcastically you know talking about how sick this is because just like joe camel admittedly
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:59.840]  targeted children with cigarettes and when i was a kid they had candy cigarettes and candy
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:06.880]  cigars to get you ready for it and it turned out that the tobacco companies early on owned those
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:15.520]  candy companies and they funded the feminist movement to tell women you show your man get
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:20.320]  out there and smoke cigarettes because it was seen as kind of an uncouth thing to do for ladies but
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:25.040]  boy those women up until even the 80s and 90s have still said you've sure come a long way
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:32.000]  virginia slim ads type in virginia slims you've come a long way there's even tv ads like
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.320]  you're moving up in society you're showing those men you'll get lung cancer like them too
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:42.240]  and what did they do they added hundreds and hundreds of chemicals to the cigarettes to make
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:50.400]  them more addictive and to get past the blood brain barrier now there it is you've come a long way
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:57.520]  maybe in post when we post this info we're not live we should just add the add-in with audio so
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:12.160]  people can hear it but it was one of Bertrand Russell's good buddies Sigmund Freud's nephew who came
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:19.360]  for the idea Edward Bernays to fund full page ads telling women march for suffrage and have freedom
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:28.640]  torches hold up your cigarettes they had doctors on tv later saying smoke camels they'll help your
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:35.600]  lungs i'd walk a mile for camel having a cough sore throat smoke a camel smoke a marlboro
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:45.040]  well look what it for the marlboro man and now it's oh mickey mouse you'll be with mickey and
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:51.600]  you grave your brain cells and it all tastes like candy and you tell the kids don't eat it
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:58.800]  but they do they eat the candy and then they see the pretty colors and then they don't do too well
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:04.800]  but that's all right it's all for the greater good of the new world order it's all done so there's
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:10.240]  not pesky people with high IQs and they'll make who'll actually read the textbooks they wrote
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:22.400]  like we're idiots and don't even care and then we've got fluoride for babies fluoride for babies
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:30.800]  isn't that just cute but i'm going to show you the studies saying oh don't don't
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:35.680]  give your kids any fluoride before their teeth are up because the studies are
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:40.320]  concluded as they go in and cause the teeth to be malformed have dental fluorosis and fracture
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:46.560]  and be chalky that was the american dental association 20 years ago started hedging its
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:53.840]  bets and creeping away from fluoride let me show you those studies but but again here's the pentagon
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:24:03.840]  bbc you name it saying chemicals to make males not have children gay bomb oh but don't worry
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:13.920]  forb says i'm crazy there's no studies they say that fluoride lowers IQ they just say i made it up
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.720]  well here it is study prompts call for lower fluoride consumption by pregnant women
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:29.120]  Reuters because it lowers the IQs particularly in boys massively over the years up to 2030 40
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:36.080]  point double bad for blacks study links fluoride water during pregnancy to lower IQs let me show
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:41.920]  you the other ones i was going to tell you about fluoride developmental neurotoxicity another study
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:47.120]  u.s department of health and human services national toxicity program so they mandate to
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:51.680]  put it in and tell you by the way we're we're killing you while we do it
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:58.000]  but drinking fluoridated water during pregnancy may lower IQs and sons oh
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:04.480]  again run off of that regime causing frogs to rape and toads to rape pythons
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:14.000]  rape snakes gang rape them oh the fluoride's not making the chemicals of water making the
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:24.240]  frogs gay they're just making them sterile and rapers prenatal fluoride exposure and cognitive
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:29.760]  outcomes in children mexico study shows the exact same thing massive IQ reduction
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:38.240]  input formula says don't mix in formulas that use water that have fluoride because it'll increase
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:46.480]  the chances of fluorosis but that's just the warning you're never told that when you're at
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:51.760]  the end cap of the grocery store and all there is is fluoride for your baby so they got screwed

[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:10.480]  who actually work for a living that would end up saving the nation and today the communist
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:16.800]  chinese have banned all u.s farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls

[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:47.760]  whatever you do spread those links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:50.880]  resistance we are 1776 worldwide
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:02.880]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:16.560]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:34.400]  water water everywhere not a drop to drink so
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:41.200]  i'm here looking at the actual government documents official policy
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:48.560]  florida lawyer iq florida lawyer fertility they've done it we can type in u.s iqs plummeting
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:54.400]  that's genetic that's chemical that's physical and i just showed you all these big new studies
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:58.560]  that came out from jamma you name it i mean okay it's giving you cancer it's lowering your IQ
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:07.520]  especially men and their answer is to come out and attack me because i think it's sick i think
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:12.160]  it's evil i think it's horrible you know all about the Tuskegee experiments you know all about
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:14.960]  the secret testing you know all about the stuff that's gone on and happened
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:21.360]  and it's a criminal group inside western governments it's a scientific dictatorship
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:30.960]  that is carrying all of this out and they know what they're doing and it's premeditated
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:38.000]  so what do we do about that because seventy something percent of the country's florida
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:46.800]  they're florida and about half of europe now and i've gone with harvard and princeton toxicologist
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:56.960]  and i've shown them universal letters signed by the unions of these federal agencies universal
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:03.280]  saying we want this out so see 99 percent of the government's not bad people but it stays in
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:08.160]  i showed you last segments studies from the u.s government warnings
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:15.840]  i mean this isn't like prop 65 where there's one part again per billion of lead in the air
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:21.520]  but they say it can't be in food that's impossible it has no effects on you it's non-detectable in
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:28.880]  almost all systems we're talking about 10 parts per hundred in some of these toothpastes i mean
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:37.360]  that's a psychological and mental death sentence what it is is a chemical weapon to induce a
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:47.120]  biological effect it is a chemical lobotomy and you warn people about this and they just go oh i
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:54.640]  heard that's a conspiracy theory because we all saw dr strange love and stanley cobra
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:00.640]  who was putting that in there to warn people about it but the only way to get it past the system
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:07.600]  was to make it a joke to tie it to end of the world nuclear weapons and fluoride
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:12.400]  see you can buy you can die from nuclear weapons you can die from fluoride you can die from the
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:17.760]  big quick weapon or you can die from the slow weapon the silent weapon for quiet wars that's
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:24.240]  how they're pentagon paper so i'm gonna go to your phone calls but it was connor who's a big
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:30.480]  exercise aficionado swimmer and he said yeah you're talking about women having twice as strong on
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:35.760]  average blood brain barriers as men and that's why they don't get as much autism it's why uh
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:43.360]  they don't get their IQ lowered as much fluoride mainly targets men it hurts women really bad i mean
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:50.320]  it's like shooting three bullets into you instead of six still doesn't feel too good but males are
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:58.800]  geared for quick action strength um not not really defensive that's why again female babies are
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:04.480]  twice as strong they've been able to take insults that's what the medical system calls being cut
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:11.280]  being shot being poisoned insults the nervous system that men can take men are on average twice
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:16.880]  as strong muscarily men on average have better vision we're all different like they have a womb
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:23.520]  they are designed to protect that and try to build little nesties and things to have that's how
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:26.880]  we're designed and the men go out defend the nest and bring things back into the nest well they've
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:32.560]  already broken that up so the human system is being destroyed before your eyes and then they
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:41.680]  introduce right out of russian gulags and nazi death camps florida water and that's a historical
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:46.240]  fact the only reason i'm hammering it now if people always ask me hey you don't cover fluoride
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:52.720]  as much and i say man i've made documentaries i've probably done a thousand shows on it i had
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:59.440]  all these scientists and i would have scientists look at those guys back on brain surgeons you
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:06.960]  name it and i'd bring them down to city council and the mayors would laugh at them they'd say
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:14.960]  here's all the studies here's the facts and they go these studies were already out there but what
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:20.640]  people are listening now because they know about the epstein and they know about the globalist
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:24.080]  they know about the world government they know about radical islam being funded and protected
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:29.120]  and they don't trust the system anymore and they don't trust mainstream media the system
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:32.480]  has cratered that's why they're trying to start a race war to start it all over again
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:36.800]  with a civil war so bad that all of this gets forgotten
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.760]  you know we were given a tour of the
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:49.680]  water treatment plant that i'm going to your calls here in austin and they said don't shoot video
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:54.080]  wink wink but let us and the skull and crossbones all over the fluoride they said if one drop gets
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:57.680]  on you it eats through your skin they show we're a drop down on the concrete and eight three inches
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:04.240]  of the concrete the only acid there's a few acids out there that act like the fictitious fictional
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:11.200]  alien blood in the movie alien and aliens pure fluoride hydrophoresic literally eats through
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:17.680]  concrete like a hot knife through butter now what do you think that does inside your body it grabs
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:23.280]  all the other toxins they all link up with it and just delivers hell through your tissues
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:29.200]  in fact it's one of the biggest causes of cancer but where are the lawyers suing over fluoride
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:37.280]  they know not to do it even though it's open and shut because it's just like the chem trailing
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:47.440]  it's just like the chem trailing
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:58.960]  cfr former ceo director comes out says yeah we're adding barium salt from dioxide to jet fuel
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:03.040]  for the major suppliers and then it creates a nuclear on the atmosphere
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:09.840]  and we control the weather we block out the sun and then bill gates comes out in spesonian magazine
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:16.240]  a week ago says yeah we're doing it we're spraying you and it's like jones you are really discredited
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:22.560]  now jones you are the filth of the planet exactly as i said with epstein i said he's into eugenics
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:28.160]  he's into death cults he's into satanism and he's into cloning that hasn't come out yet
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:35.680]  you watch the cloning is going to come out what do you think he was being given all these mysterious
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:42.640]  millions for he was an investment of the albert einstein institute that he headed up to carry out
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:48.640]  the development of a planetary regime to carry out the extermination of the human population
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:52.560]  and the rise of the superman in german uber mensch
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:03.040]  you know watch my film in game i show you that institute i show you who's at it could have gone
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:11.440]  and seen the head epstein they're abusing the children for trauma based mind control again the
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:19.040]  the the the 15 and 14 year old girls they're just the the outer room we're going to go to break

[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:05.760]  and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or legal
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:09.760]  for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:13.760]  judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:17.200]  members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:21.440]  political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:25.360]  they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:29.680]  ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:34.400]  recover after the great depression the info wars audience is the fuel that flames the the light
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:39.520]  of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:43.840]  the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:48.240]  manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:51.920]  thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:56.320]  form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:01.760]  i talk about this on the air and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:05.760]  gonna kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before all the
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:10.000]  censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the products
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.760]  are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:17.920]  they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:21.040]  shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:26.000]  and how wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:32.400]  supplements and he claims or supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:36.400]  supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction it won't look at it but then
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:40.800]  they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:44.640]  tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:49.040]  great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:47:06.160]  god's medicine chest info or store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:27.280]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen i'm going to your calls now and then coming up the bottom
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:31.680]  of the next hour joey gibson's going to pop in but i'm going to tim and ryan and i wish
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:35.280]  everybody else here in about a minute i want to just go back to plugging here
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:42.800]  because i didn't plug anything to the very end of the first hour and i was here doing a counting
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:46.560]  yesterday and i don't like to sit here and complain and i don't think this is really the
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:50.160]  time to get into this but there's two different paths we can go down because i'm never giving up
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:55.520]  i can massively downsize in about a year so everybody's still got their job
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:04.880]  or i can figure out how to get more money into here i mean it's really simple
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:11.360]  here's the deal we got great customers that buy the products and so if i sell all the inventory
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:18.480]  we have some of it's out to six months of t-shirts books film supplements because we're
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:26.720]  self-funding i can pay all the bills for a year but i've now hit a point in the mathematics
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:31.760]  because folks like raises and bonuses and i want to expand and i don't want to i want to fight hard
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:37.920]  so i'm in a race and i've got so much gas before my next pit stop to refuel and i'm going to push
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:43.840]  it one more lap to win the race but i might run out of gas before i finish the race but if i pull
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:49.200]  over into the pit stop i don't think we'll make it i mean so i've really been praying about this
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:54.160]  and i mean praying hard and really i just told myself you got to cut better ads you got to explain
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:58.560]  how good these products are and you just really got to get up off your ass and explain to the
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:02.960]  listeners that this is serious because it's always serious we wouldn't be here wasn't for you they've
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:06.880]  taken our sponsors harassed us suit us over the years i mean you know what's going on it's they
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:16.640]  tried to plant child porn on us it's been incredible and we've cut the fat down to the bone we figured
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:22.160]  out a lot of things i've gotten better at you know business and a lot of things to be able to still
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:28.960]  be on air and you've come through spreading the word your financial support but i want to add
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:32.560]  some more shows which are happening next month and i want to fight back and i want to be able to
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:38.720]  defeat these lawsuits which i can do we beat a lot of you'll never hear that in the news but i
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:44.160]  really need people to understand hey if i just go sign up for rato ship so i don't forget and i get
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:49.280]  my coffee and i get my fluoride free toothpaste fortified with iodonic little silver and if i
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:54.800]  get my fish oil my krill oil things everybody should be taking and my water filtration
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:00.720]  and if you had a filter two three years alexa pure propyr probably time to replace those filters
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:05.040]  they're already rated the highest quality out there and you're like yeah they're half the price of
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:09.760]  stuff at a fancy store because they they mark stuff up three four times and you know that's
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:15.280]  how they stay in business we don't do that i make 70 bucks on a filter at full price you know the
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:23.120]  big ones when it's on sale 35 and so we bring in a ton of money but we've got smart blessers we've
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:28.320]  got midwest and texans and folks out west and farmers and people in the you know blue collar
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:32.640]  folks you know and then the east coast everywhere and you know a lot of business people and they're

[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:46.720]  oil the ultimate krill oil ladies and gentlemen is the ultimate krill oil we went out and found
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:51.200]  the highest rated organic one that does the process if there's any mercury to remove it that's what
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:55.760]  triples the cost for us it's already super low in krill but we know we're getting tested in
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:51:01.600]  california by their standards that are impossible to pass so we go to the insane level and you
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:05.680]  notice this is that beautiful red of krill and you couldn't do something better for your body

[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:39.440]  that support so thank you all right let's go ahead and go back to your calls or go to your calls
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:45.520]  tam thanks for holding in montana you're on the air worldwide about water and the chemicals that
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:51.760]  are in it go ahead hi alex actually i was going to talk about hydrofluoric acid use in oil
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:59.600]  refineries you know they use a hf acid in oil refineries very extensively and in those areas
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:05.520]  they're painted off marked very very significantly to where people obviously know where those areas
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:10.960]  they're at you have to wear special uh you know like rain suits you have to have all your cuffs
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:16.160]  taped off and everything they have tools that they uh only use in those areas because if you get
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:24.560]  even a small portion of that into your skin the uh the acid is uh it's uh drawn to the calcium in
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:31.040]  your bones and it will actually dissolve your bones in a very small amount of that will kill you and
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:40.160]  the ph level on a hydrofluoric acid is 3.17 whereas hydrofluoric acid is 1.2 so hydrofluoric
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:45.040]  acid is even more acidic than what they're using in these oil refineries that they take great
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:50.960]  precautions to prevent their employees from from coming in contact with that and yet we're dumping
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:55.440]  the stuff that's more acidic in our water by the way you're an incredible caller stay there but but
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:54:02.320]  it sounds like you're either an engineer or a scientist uh or a someone or a rough neck that's
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:07.200]  really informed because you're absolutely right about that and again all you gotta do is type in
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:12.880]  bone cancer and fluoridation and so you're explaining to people the fluoride they put in our water
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:19.520]  is stronger than super strong chemical stuff that they use uh in petroleum exploration
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:26.960]  exactly the the oil and gas refining process you know i i'm not an engineer or a scientist i work
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:32.480]  in a technical field but you know it's i i uh i work with with the oil refineries and i've been in
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:36.400]  there and that's not something you mess around with i mean if you're walking through and you
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:40.560]  take your hard hat off you scratch your head and you get a drop on your head you better hope that
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:46.640]  that was condensation and not acid because guess what you've got a hole in your skull by the morning
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:51.600]  you know it's it's it is a it's a there was a great video i saw one time that the honeywell
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:56.720]  company put out and it was talking about the great precautions you need to take and why and uh you
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:55:03.360]  know it's it's just amazing to me that people they just want to put their head in the stand and
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:08.640]  no no one would ever do anything like that to us it can't be true and that's why alice i i just
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:13.840]  when are they gonna when are they gonna accept that you're right when are they gonna admit that
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:20.320]  man you this guy he's got it tomorrow's news today i mean you everything you do if you listen
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:25.680]  it eventually it eventually comes out and i just i tell people all the time you're that you're
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:31.200]  where i get my news and then i cross-reference and by god you're right everything well i appreciate
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:35.200]  you and god bless you please keep spreading the word but i don't want to take my horn here
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:40.000]  our audience is smarter than i am on those subjects it's been known for 100 years what
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.800]  hydrofluorosalic acid does we've had major industry for 200 plus years they've known
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:51.120]  like you said in in in the um production of gasoline at the refinery level and before that
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:54.960]  at the exploration level i mean they're dealing with all this toxic stuff everybody knows that's
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:56:03.360]  why 100 percent of the FDA scientist in the mid 90s and again in like 2010 was it they got every
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:09.840]  one of their engineers and toxicologists and chemists to sign a letter saying take it out of the water
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:16.640]  and you know what the feds still push and and hold back money to the states they don't florida
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:21.760]  but you go into any rich person's house or any liberal's house they're not drinking tap water
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:28.080]  but they have all these initiatives about oh you should drink it good good good these are monsters
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:34.720]  they want to kill babies after they're born keep them comfortable and and so the sooner we come to
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:41.200]  grips with these monsters the better we'll talk to alex about kim's in the water lowering iq
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:44.960]  making the frogs gay and i just threw that out there as a pop thing it was a headline
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:49.360]  was it like in berkeley newspaper it's making the frogs gay literally they want male frogs not
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:54.000]  females they go hump male frogs and then no babies there's you know they don't fertilize the eggs
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:59.840]  because there's no eggs coming out the rear end of a male frog and then the frogs die but david
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:06.080]  hawk goes that's great i love things being gay what does that even mean and so when we go to that
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:13.280]  next caller i'll show you the article there's a video of it too of large snakes being raped by
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:20.240]  gangs of toads and frogs as because of the atrazine it drives them mad with lust i've got the headline
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:28.000]  here is lusting toads gang rape large snake and they say the phenomenon is so bad that that they'll
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:32.720]  that they'll pile up on them until the snake basically just dies there's just all these
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:41.440]  frogs hopping on it raping it so frogs are driving me i'm just it's incredible what they do you'll
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:50.240]  see the video for yourself stay with us thomas jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when
[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:54.560]  our republic was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:59.200]  close to reality who actually work for a living that would end up saving the nation and today
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:05.440]  the communist chinese have banned all u.s farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:11.040]  in polls support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once china put pressure
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:16.000]  on our farmers that's beautiful americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:21.440]  down so to the walking cruises and the hillary clinton's the world that want to intimidate people
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:26.000]  and tell us to back down we're never going to give up and all you've done is awaken the human
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:31.920]  spirit and the human spirit lives at info wars dot com and news wars dot com and i'm asking listeners
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:37.040]  whatever you do to spread those links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:44.080]  resistance we are 1776 worldwide
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:49.520]  let's talk to marcus in new york marcus you're on the air thanks for holding
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:53.920]  hey elk yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:58.560]  here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:03.040]  wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because
[01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:07.200]  they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:11.760]  approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:15.360]  the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:19.040]  my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:24.000]  to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  you're 80 years old i'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:33.600]  you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:37.360]  like myself and many others who are going to continue we're going to keep fighting in the
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:42.000]  info war and even if something does happen to you or your show know for a fact that you've
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.600]  gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank you sir for calling
[01:59:45.600 --> 02:00:01.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:07.600]  i'm taking your phone calls jelly gibson's popping in
[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:14.800]  fresh off the heels of being arrested for daring to go to portland the pro boys have been convicted
[02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:19.760]  in new york for defending themselves by a sycophantic jury that was told they were the racist
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:27.200]  what are they're nazis in 15 years in prison but right now we're going back to your phone calls
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:35.120]  let's go ahead and talk to alex in michigan alex you're on the air welcome thanks so much for
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:40.960]  taking my call alex what an honor to be a part of this legendary broadcast today thanks sir you're
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:47.760]  doing an amazing job exposing the hydrofluorosalistic acid in the water mainly from china um the vaccines
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:54.320]  causing autism the chemtrails the human clones the gmo's uh big pharma dumping prozac in the water
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:59.200]  and of course the atrazine and bpa estrogen mimickers turning the frogs gay
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:05.920]  and you have the solution if everyone went to info restore dot com and bought a water filter and the
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:10.960]  x2 and the bodies actually there's a lot of studies on turmeric uh being able to get fluoride out of
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:16.080]  the brain well that's right i mean we just promote everything that's super good and we're against
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:21.520]  everything that's super bad so we like sunshine we like green grass we like jesus we like america
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:27.040]  we like the second amendment we like capitalism we like the free market we like liberty uh and
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:30.720]  you know we don't like chemicals that sterilize us and kill us and so that's why we're against us i
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:35.440]  wouldn't say i'm a hero for harping on this i just can't believe they've gotten away with this
[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:42.080]  so long when they admit it's designed to literally sterilize us and kill us exactly and i know this
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:48.400]  is a little controversial but cannabis has been shown to also reverse autism um just something
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:53.680]  to throw out there of course organic cannabis none of the george soros monsanto pesticide crap out
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:02:00.800]  there but also spirulina uh is a good option too if you wanted to add that to the info restore
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:06.560]  spirulina algae uh is another solution to get a gunk out of your body and i just want to throw
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:12.880]  this out out there alex if you need help uh with your info wars operation as a listener
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:16.800]  and fan i want to do everything i can to support you if you never ever need any help i'll come
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:22.000]  down there texas i'll pull a ted newton and uh work for minimum wage i don't care i'm kind of a
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:27.600]  minimalist so just throw it out there well if we don't get the funding we may have to do that down
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:30.640]  the road but we've kind of got a lean mean fighting machine right now and it's not that we don't
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:35.360]  want help uh it's just that we're trying to get it all developed and all set up you know i found
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:40.960]  a really really funny meme page that whole bunch of alex jones gay frog memes and where alex jones
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:46.720]  is holding back the gay chemicals from everybody uh no folks it it's funny but it's not but at least
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:52.560]  it gets uh the information out to everybody to have a larger discussion i appreciate your call
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:58.800]  let me give folks some viewer discretion is advised we're going to put this up on tv
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:07.200]  stream for folks uh this is uh from the cbc and warning this is gay frog rape photos and video
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:13.040]  and i'm not being funny here uh this is a horny confused cane toads are humping a python that
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:18.640]  says biologist these cane toads pictured above on the back of a python
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:27.680]  in australia we're actually blind with lust says the amphibian expert and then it goes
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:35.360]  into how again this is happening more and more uh because they are dealing with all of the
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:40.800]  atrazine and the rest of it and but it's cute and fun to be gay now and then and then of course
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:48.160]  they just die but but but getting serious um they try to make a joke out of all this it's not funny
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:55.280]  here's cnn once in a while being truthful i2 scores are falling and have been for decades
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:04:05.360]  new study of hines and again the fluoride is on record as the main cause why do you think
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:09.600]  because these studies are always coming out why is it so big now why would yahoo put it on the
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:14.800]  front page now because before they'd hide that because the study is also the same thing i mean
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:19.360]  it's conclusive like shooting your head itself in the head with a gun it and good for you it
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:24.480]  probably will kill you or if you take cyanide it's gonna kill you you take a lethal dose of cyanide
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:33.840]  a gram of it you're gonna die well you drink fluoride you're gonna have little bitty genitals
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:41.680]  and it's gonna eat holes in your brain and you're gonna be partially sterile so why the hell are
[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:46.000]  they doing it because they're eugenicists who want you to be dumb so they cannot compete you
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:51.840]  they're jerks they're criminals they're leftist they're devil worshipers they're child rapists
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:59.680]  they're evil the globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators they are technocrats
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:04.000]  they are control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:09.680]  and make your own decisions hits are the way of their great destiny to merge with ai gods now we're
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:13.680]  fighting them hard in cyberspace we're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension
[02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:18.000]  but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:23.280]  in our lives is our bodies if i wasn't taking the highest quality supplements for the forest life
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:29.600]  dot com i couldn't do it that's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:37.360]  quality medical bottom and double the strength of it in a new formula ultra 12 ultra 12 is undoubtedly
[02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:42.320]  the strongest highest quality b12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere it is amazing
[02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:47.600]  experience pure medical bottom and b12 for yourself and fund the second american evolution
[02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:53.360]  against the tyrants at info wars store dot com enforce live dot com or triple eight two five
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:06:12.480]  three three one three nine the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:19.200]  so give a normal man
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:29.040]  a regular person not an anointed drag queen story time person tried to come into the park
[02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:34.960]  and ask your kid to sit on their lap and the man wanted to talk to your six-year-old about
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:43.760]  how much fun oral sex is that arrest him for soliciting abuse with a child but when it's
[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:51.040]  put in the library as a book of the wonderful experiences of adults who enjoyed men having
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:55.520]  sex with them when they were little kids well then it's endorsed by the library association
[02:06:56.480 --> 02:07:01.760]  and if a man in the park wanted to give your child something that looked like it was pretty blue
[02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:08.400]  or pretty pink and had mickey mouse or mini mouse or a little mermaid on the front of it
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:13.920]  and then you found out that this would lower their IQ give them a
[02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:23.040]  seven to fifty fold increase in bone cancer that's exploded off the chart and it's in all
[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:27.840]  the studies right here and lower their IQ well if you caught them doing that before the police
[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:35.280]  got there you beat their ass and they're in the grand jury in the country that wouldn't say no bill
[02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:39.280]  he may have knocked that guy's teeth out and broke his jawbone
[02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:44.240]  but that's what you do to somebody soliciting your child
[02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:50.320]  catch him talking to your kid in the back back fence about hey junior pull your pants down
[02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:57.040]  you're gonna like it to get their ass kicked but oh when they do it in the school and it's a big
[02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:04.880]  old fat man now it's hard and when they give you that fluoride that weaponize you heard the
[02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:11.440]  guy calling earlier he's right the stuff they use at the oil refineries to break down oil break down
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:17.680]  hard oil and to separate it out if you get a drop of it on you it can kill you and it's not even as
[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:23.120]  strong as what they put in your water when they dump hydrofluorosalicylic acid in the water supply
[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:29.760]  in austin they put on full body suits and they're about 50 yards away we've been doing it and they
[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:37.280]  turn it and then they run around the corner and they're still all gonna die cancer
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:47.040]  so remember that they know what they're doing
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:56.480]  and remember it's a plan and it's the people up on top 100 percent
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:06.160]  of the FDA scientist over a thousand of them signed petitions twice in the last 30 years
[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:09.600]  unanimously saying pull it out of the water didn't do it did they
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:14.880]  because there's a plan you ever heard have you heard the lawyers sue over fluoride
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:23.440]  i mean it's way worse than life will say oh no no no because it's not kosher it's not acceptable
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:31.840]  it's verboten forbidden and it's all this big mind game because you don't want forbs to write an
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:39.040]  article about you saying you're an evil horrible man big cover story alex jones is evil he says
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:47.360]  fluoride increases cancer and lowers IQ especially in boys and blacks
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:57.200]  because he's a nazi but it was the nazis put it in the water of the death camps
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:04.400]  because it made them more docile but the nazis gave it to people in the water way
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:10.000]  stronger and they put it in our water they put it in there not even as strong though as is in
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:16.880]  the candy flavor toothpaste that everyone knows the kids swallow when mommy isn't looking and
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:22.560]  then they get real quiet and just kind of fade out all day and they get put in special ed
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:27.440]  because there's a chemical weapon eating their cerebral cortex
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:36.080]  but it's got to be good to put in the tummy because the little mermaid who had her voice
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:40.640]  in her soul stolen like all those other slaves by the evil witch
[02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:49.920]  and now she's going to get your kids just like the pedophiles will use a kid to lure kids to the
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:58.720]  van i've got a puppy i've got candy come to my van over here but instead it's the little mermaid
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:05.680]  oh no who else is going to help you get in the van oh the little velociraptor
[02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:18.560]  or mickey mickey mouse oh or the fruit explosion toothpaste tell the little primate oh look it's
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:30.320]  fruit eat it looks just like one of your yogurt tubes oh jr can't read the zoom in please because on
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:39.120]  the back tells you do not ingest it and if you do call poison control we put that up on screen for
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:44.480]  folks type in the toothpaste warning i'll go to your calls again i appreciate calling i just this
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:49.680]  is kind of a big deal because the question is why is it suddenly being put in the news because
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:12:01.680]  they're moving on to 5g oh hydrophoresic acid is a acid it's a it's a amped up molecule
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:10.080]  it's electrical they got something better it's letting off they go microwave us with the 5g
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:15.600]  baby and they admit out of the gates it kills you so everybody get ready to move on upstairs
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:24.400]  because you're gonna be dead whoa you think you're gonna cut the fluoride out we're gonna kill your
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:33.120]  ass with 5g baby it's a lot of fun dying isn't it horrible excruciating death and having those

[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:29.440]  fluoride testimony thanks for calling sir hey what's up alec long time first time
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:34.800]  what do you think of the broadcast uh good man it's good it's impactful again um i just
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:40.000]  said on target is somebody that worked in this area yeah well when i was 23 man i started over
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:46.320]  there as an underwater operator um here in the bay area not to get into details but uh when when i
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:53.040]  first was part of a project not a project but a delivery into our bulk storage tank um the inside
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:57.760]  of our tank was all you know it said poison and you know like you said skull and crossbones this
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:02.800]  and that and i was i wasn't familiar with it so we had to put on these tibet kim susan and
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:07.120]  respirators and i'm thinking like why are we putting all this on for something that we're
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:11.840]  putting into our water so i looked it up a little bit and my brother was already kind of hit to
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:16.480]  employers and he told me about it he filled me in a little bit i did a little bit more research
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:24.000]  and then boom the light went off and um it came to me and it's like wow i'm i'm actually putting
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:30.400]  this stuff in the water firsthand and there was um there's these lids on top of our bulk storage
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:34.960]  tank that are all rusted out all the plumbing we have to go in there and change it out every three
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:40.800]  to five years because once that stuff uh gets into the air it starts eating away at everything
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:47.360]  and you can i mean yes it eats steel and concrete but your child's brain oh that's different
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:55.200]  yeah so i mean um and the all the the guy who levered the stuff his hands were all beat up
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:15:02.720]  and mangled his uh his suit was just just a mess and it it it just goes to show that you know a
[02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:06.480]  lot of people don't realize what this stuff is and i even asked a customer one day i'm like
[02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:11.120]  i feel about Florida the water oh oh it's the greatest thing this white spread i said i would
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:14.960]  think twice about it and go do some research and of course you live in the country club
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:20.480]  she didn't know any better and um well because she's in the country club why we run the country
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:25.680]  and there nothing wrong here just drink it up yeah well hopefully she came across this article
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:30.960]  today and she uh realized the conversation she had about five six years ago and uh she thinks
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:35.200]  twice about it but hey man keep doing what you're doing alex and brother you keep doing it you're

[02:20:26.800 --> 02:20:32.720]  reductions in iq and massive decreases in fertility it's one of the most studied chemicals
[02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:40.880]  in world history they've known when it does for 200 years because they had to deal with it in chemical
[02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:46.240]  manufacturing production only thing studied more would be something like mercury or lead
[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:53.520]  and they knew 200 years ago that people that work with lead or mercury were mad as hatters the guys
[02:20:53.520 --> 02:21:00.960]  that made hats would stain it with mercury think about that your calls are coming up next segment
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:06.720]  joey gibson's been kind enough to join us he's the founder of the patriot prayer march he just
[02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:10.320]  saw a bunch of bullies three years ago beating up men women and children they tried to have gun
[02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:16.640]  rallies property rights rallies and if it would show up all over the pacific northwest down to
[02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:22.240]  california and famously polosi was out there supporting them in san francisco and they attacked
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:26.320]  even their own crowds even the liberals that came out got attacked by them there's such
[02:21:26.880 --> 02:21:32.720]  meth ed scum well now we've seen them attack children attack people with hammers and even ap
[02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:39.360]  i've got the headline here somewhere i showed you yesterday admitted that the patriots were
[02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:46.800]  peaceful and that the antivirus violent even after the proud boys left but joey gibson
[02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:58.400]  joey gibson he got arrested he got arrested for being there months before and simply
[02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:05.120]  doing nothing they said inciting a riot because when antivirus threatening him he stood his ground
[02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:10.160]  remember what chris komo said he said the covington kids are bad because they stood their ground
[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:16.080]  when a man came over with people yelling that they were going to kill them and genocide them
[02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:20.080]  because they were white and beating a drum in their face when they were just there to pick up a bus
[02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:34.400]  a general bus so the mob surrounds our guests joey gibson and now they're trying to put him
[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:40.160]  in jail and it's a perfect time to have him on because proud boys maxwell hare and john kings
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:43.920]  when we already showed the footage the first hour with gab mcginnis joined us founder of the proud
[02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:49.360]  boys they follow him out of their event the police escort in just like antifa always does
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:55.680]  they try to attack them near their cars they simply fight back it's a 15 second scrap on a
[02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:59.200]  scale of one to ten it's like a two nobody got their teeth knocked out
[02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:08.000]  and they're facing 15 years one of us already on rikers island where they hold
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:18.560]  people from the mafia hitmen so this is this is the new crime joey gibson strange days my friend
[02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:24.000]  but congratulations on keeping your chin up and you guys not being violent in the face of those pigs
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:29.920]  yeah the organizers joe bigs and rike did a really good job i'm really impressed
[02:23:30.480 --> 02:23:35.040]  they were committed to avoiding the violence they understood that the media is going to use that
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:38.800]  against us shoot they probably arrest a bunch of people for defending themselves you know i got
[02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:43.520]  arrested for not even being violent like you know standing on a sidewalk and getting pepper
[02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:48.640]  sprayed i mean talk about civil rights like you know people have been kind of you know haven't
[02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:52.240]  really been paying attention to antifa that much they like watching the videos but they think it's
[02:23:52.240 --> 02:23:55.840]  just a bunch of gangs fighting in the streets so people don't pay attention to it but now
[02:23:55.840 --> 02:23:58.560]  you know they should really wake people up especially what you're talking about with the
[02:23:58.560 --> 02:24:01.840]  two proud boys in new york they didn't do anything wrong we shouldn't be saying these people to prison
[02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:06.800]  it's very important to understand that antifa is allowed to go on the streets with batons like
[02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:12.720]  literally with no masks on right so you can identify them take it to the cars right uh
[02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:16.880]  block traffic like literally start riots and they don't charge them at all ever
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:22.480]  and you look at them attacking people with hammers blooding people inside vehicles
[02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:27.040]  doing all this you guys don't even fight back and a lot of the media said that you were the
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:33.440]  bad guys ap actually got it right which was pretty pretty amazing so when you read through the
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:40.240]  headlines most of them say uh uh proud boys clash with antifa or far left clashes with far right
[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:44.400]  and everything but you know they don't have any film to show all this shows antifa fighting with
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:50.800]  the police or antifa beating on a random guy and his daughter right so they're really trying to
[02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:54.240]  manipulate things and i know that you talk about this but it's important for people to understand
[02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:59.200]  that this is like exactly what china does you know they manipulate the culture they just repeat it
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:04.400]  over and over and over again until people believe it people believe that i'm some far right extremists
[02:25:04.400 --> 02:25:09.600]  they believe that i'm racist and they believe that i've hate speech but they can't find one piece of
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:13.760]  evidence this is the world we live in and i know you understand alex you gotta deal with it more
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:18.000]  than anybody but you know i just wish people do the research open your eyes let's pull people out
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:23.440]  of the matrix come on now like let's go wake up united states like this is our freedom that is
[02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:29.440]  under attack and all you can think about is that everything is racist that's it that's it all the
[02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:33.680]  footage of this girl that could be no more than 10 or 11 and with her dad and they again if you
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:37.200]  watch the whole footage there's 20 minutes of it they follow them while they're trying to get to
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:41.520]  their car he wasn't there looking for trouble he came out to exercise free speech and they wait
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:46.160]  like cowards and they're even attacking her she got taser but the taser didn't go in they threw
[02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:51.040]  mace on them pepper spray i mean this is just imagine if a republican or a proud boy was doing
[02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:55.760]  this to somebody a huge horde of white methods and i'm just because they keep saying everybody's
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:26:00.000]  racist it's almost all white people chasing down a white guy and his daughter i mean the radio
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:05.760]  listeners can't see this it's on info wars dot com it's just unbelievable yeah absolutely and this
[02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:08.880]  is what i tell reporters all the time i said because everyone keeps talking about the white
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:13.440]  supremacist movement the white nationalist movement and i say listen if there's a thousand white
[02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:17.680]  supremacists running through the streets beating up people on the left because of their speech
[02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:22.560]  like i would be there to stand up for the democrats i would be there to stand up for the liberals i
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:28.800]  don't understand why it's so hard for the left to disavow antifa like are you that afraid or do you
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:33.920]  just believe that their behavior is okay because these guys are literally acting like how racist
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:38.240]  treated black people back in the day like it's identical they're acting like how nazis want to
[02:26:38.240 --> 02:26:42.880]  treat jews so it's it's just amazing that everything they say they're against that's how they're acting
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:48.000]  it's like that what was that show was there was an mtv show back when they still had some good
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:53.840]  shows of comedy and uh it's the nazi sit around going we're in black uniforms we have skulls on
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:27:00.160]  maybe we're the baddies and if you look at them they are so bad and so villainous and so cowardly
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:04.000]  attacking women children people in wheelchairs i noticed they don't ever want to attack big guys
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.800]  like you unless you have like a club or something they still get their ass kicked but they target
[02:27:08.800 --> 02:27:15.360]  women and children or like a little gay asian dude yeah absolutely and and they love to target
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:21.440]  minorities because i have a guy that goes down to school down in one of the two-year universities
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:27.520]  in the bay area by uc berkeley um that's where the professor who used the bike lock that's where he
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:32.160]  taught this kid that came out of school said they kicked him out for so-called racism even though he's
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:37.920]  indian um he said they specifically target conservatives who are of color so they're
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:42.480]  literally racist like they're literally trying to find people of color or or or people that who are
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:46.560]  yeah they're bullying they're bullying and telling me what they can do and there's also footage of
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:52.560]  white guys calling black guys racial terms because they're cops i mean they don't even believe in
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:57.200]  borders police anything of course they do they want full control let's let's let's play this audio as

[02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:06.160]  it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground close to reality who actually work for a living
[02:30:06.160 --> 02:30:10.960]  that would end up saving the nation and today the communist chinese have banned all u.s farming
[02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:17.040]  goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what he's
[02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:23.120]  doing in this trade war once china put pressure on our farmers that's beautiful americans aren't

[02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:59.040]  or
[02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:05.040]  or
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:14.560]  recently president trump launched a new offensive against progressives
[02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:18.800]  by drawing attention to the decrepit state of major leftist run cities.
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:22.160]  Wonder where he got that idea from, but forget about Baltimore.
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:26.640]  If Baltimore was a toilet, LA would be a 500-acre landfill.
[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:31.200]  LA can truly lay claim to the accolade of being king of the sh**holes.
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:36.000]  There are now an estimated 60,000 homeless people living on the streets of LA.
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:40.000]  That's a 75% rise in homelessness since 2012.
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:41.920]  Did you ever see I Am Legend?
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:42.240]  Yes.
[02:34:42.240 --> 02:34:45.600]  Okay, remember when all the f**king crazy zombie people are running at once?
[02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:45.920]  Yeah.
[02:34:45.920 --> 02:34:46.640]  That's what it's like.
[02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:47.200]  You serious?
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:49.440]  I'm telling you, you can't believe the volume.
[02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:56.080]  To illustrate the homeless problem, look at this comparison between 2015 and 2017.
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:35:01.680]  Look at the increase in trash and tents in a period of little over two years.
[02:35:01.680 --> 02:35:05.600]  And what's the mere solution to paint murals of homeless people?
[02:35:05.600 --> 02:35:08.560]  Because painting a mural of people who can't afford one.
[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:11.760]  She starts rolling to me.
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:16.720]  I stepped on my headset cord and broke it, so I had to find a new one.
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:22.000]  Sorry, we're getting back late here, but that's part of Paul's LA as a, you know, what hole.
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:27.040]  And why is every area run by Democrats either collapsing or in a stage of collapse?
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:28.160]  Awesome used to be awesome.
[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:32.880]  Now, it resembles a toilet bowl in many areas and crimes going up.
[02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:37.440]  We're going to call us in a moment with Joey Gibson, who again marches all over the West Coast,
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:40.720]  mainly, but he's also gone and covered what's happening in Hong Kong.
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:44.560]  Why do you think everywhere they're in control degenerates so fast?
[02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:51.840]  One of the things too is, you know, the big government is about bringing as much money
[02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:52.560]  as you can, right?
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:56.000]  So they convince the folks to bring in a bunch of taxes, but then they don't want to use that
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.800]  money to go clean up the streets and clean up their problems, right?
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:01.920]  They want to use that money to go to special contracts or wherever that money goes.
[02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:05.280]  I always tell people this that, you know, they go up on that grandstand and say,
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:07.760]  hey, we need raises for teachers, right?
[02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:10.960]  So they increase taxes and like 5% of it goes to the teachers.
[02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:13.920]  95% of it disappears to a bunch of different, you know, special interests.
[02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:17.680]  How bad do you think it's going to get?
[02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:21.200]  And when do you think Trump is going to declare them a terrorist organization?
[02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:22.320]  Because I'm all for free speech.
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:27.600]  But when you organize and say your mission is to stop other people's speech using violence
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:31.840]  and to make them politically submit to you, that's the textbook definition of terrorism.
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:37.520]  As soon as he gets evidence that there's money coming in from outside the country,
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:42.080]  as soon as he gets evidence, you know, that certain organizations like CARE that work hand
[02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:47.120]  in hand with Antifa, as soon as he gets evidence that the Chinese are involved in this,
[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:49.200]  I think that that's when he can push really hard on it.
[02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:53.600]  Because we literally have outside forces of this country that are funding and pushing this
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:56.080]  division in our country, especially with the media.
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:58.720]  The media is not owned by this country, all right?
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:00.160]  Let's make that very clear.
[02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:06.240]  And the media overwhelmingly supports Antifa or is completely silent on their behavior, right?
[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:09.680]  They don't, it's just so unbelievable how much they justify their behavior.
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:14.720]  Just like that lady who went on national television on CNN who was saying that Trump
[02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:18.000]  sided with the Nazis instead of siding with the peaceful protesters,
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:19.920]  which she was referring to Antifa.
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:22.080]  So, like you said, it's clown world.
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:23.920]  They do it over and over again.
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:28.400]  I want to get you back on later this week to give us your take on Hong Kong.
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:31.600]  We're going to have some reporters that I'm talking to over in Hong Kong
[02:37:31.600 --> 02:37:32.720]  that are going to be popping in.
[02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:34.800]  And because the word is, that is heating up very, very quickly.
[02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:39.120]  I've been talking to some of the British connected folks in the government.
[02:37:39.680 --> 02:37:42.480]  You know, there's obviously a couple of different factions over there.
[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:44.320]  We're going to be looking at that very, very soon.
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:46.640]  Joey Gibson, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:48.320]  Thank you.
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:50.000]  All right, there goes Joey Gibson.
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.440]  I promise to get to your calls.
[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:52.480]  So I appreciate you holding.
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:55.600]  We're going to get to everybody now before this hour ends.
[02:37:55.600 --> 02:37:58.880]  Or we're going to go in the next hour to take care of it.
[02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:01.520]  But Mike Adams is loaded for bear as always.
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:04.560]  There's a lot of other news I haven't hit yet that I also want to try to cram in with Mike.
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:10.000]  So I'll probably just co-host with him some though I have a dintu appointment today.
[02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:16.320]  NPR reported that all my teeth were knocked out when I was a teenager.
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:21.760]  Because I was tied up by children I bullied and taken to a field and all my teeth were knocked out.
[02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:23.120]  I just always love that.
[02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:26.880]  I offered to go have my teeth looked at that I've never had a tooth knocked out.
[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:32.640]  And they did not do it because they're a pack of criminal liars.
[02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:37.520]  And again, then they run with that at hundreds of articles about my ethos that I'm a bully.
[02:38:38.800 --> 02:38:44.400]  No, you the left are a bunch of pedophile backing Islamic backing scum.
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:47.440]  It's unbelievable.
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:50.720]  And you always want to get into countries that have some symbols of freedom
[02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:55.120]  because next time I'm going to play a clip of it to leave crying and saying my grandmother
[02:38:56.560 --> 02:38:59.600]  couldn't get into Israel for health care.
[02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:02.960]  She's not an Israeli citizen.
[02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:06.000]  But to leave says we need open borders.
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.520]  Everyone come here free stuff.
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:12.720]  But you can't come to that fat ass's house and ask her to give you some money.
[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:13.280]  She won't.
[02:39:13.280 --> 02:39:17.600]  It's like Maxine Waters buys a book from a homeless woman who's trying to help skid row.
[02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:20.960]  Acts like she's done a good job and smiles like she's this good, great person.
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:25.360]  She's the sociopath, probably a psychopath, doesn't know how dumb it looks and then goes,
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:26.880]  I need change for my 20.
[02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:28.160]  I need $10.
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:30.720]  You should have given her the whole 20.
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:34.320]  You stupid witcher said, I'm going to take you to Congress for a tour.
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:37.920]  We're going to promote what you're doing and try to get some private citizens there to help.
[02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:40.320]  But no, instead she just, I'm helping everybody.
[02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:41.280]  We're going to play that next hour.
[02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:43.200]  That's a cute to get the video.
[02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:50.560]  And in waving the money around, that's up on info wars.com and news wars.com.
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:58.480]  This is all rivetingly poignant stuff that really illustrates the type of nutcases we're dealing with.
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:02.400]  I mean, I couldn't imagine talking to a woman trying to pull the homeless out and publish
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:04.160]  her own book and slip it on the street.
[02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:08.160]  She's trying to provide tents for people and mental health with the money she made out
[02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:14.160]  of a book and Maxine Waters wouldn't give her $20 for it and smiles and goes, look how good I am.
[02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:14.960]  I'm helping.
[02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:20.160]  Yeah, how many, what's your husband's still 30 million was it in two different swindles,
[02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:22.400]  a taxpayer money, right to his own damn bank.
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:26.080]  But look, I'm going to give this lady $10.
[02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:28.880]  I'm so nice.
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:31.680]  What a freakazoid, man.
[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:36.640]  Fake is a $3 bill.
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:40.640]  Okay, back to the calls, my friends.
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:42.640]  I just ranted a whole other segment, didn't I?
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:43.600]  Oh, no, Joey was on with us.
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:48.560]  Who should we go to?
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:49.600]  There's been holding the longest here.
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:54.640]  Jefferson's been holding the longest.
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:56.000]  Jefferson in Virginia, you're on the air.
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:56.240]  Thank you.
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:40:56.640]  Go ahead.
[02:40:58.160 --> 02:40:59.600]  Thank you for letting me on, Alex.
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:00.480]  Thank you for calling.
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:02.160]  Are you kidding?
[02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:08.160]  Joey Gibson and the Proud Boys are in a bind because they get over prosecuted for simply
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:09.120]  protecting themselves.
[02:41:09.120 --> 02:41:12.640]  The president and AG Barr need to step in on this and say, this is ridiculous.
[02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:16.960]  So these people get charged and sometimes convicted of things they didn't even really do.
[02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:17.280]  Exactly.
[02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:22.240]  We need the FBI to go for an indictment of the day long threats and harassment for two days.
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:23.920]  It stopped them in a bunch of venues.
[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:24.960]  They finally get a venue.
[02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:29.520]  They come and promise to kill the cops, attack them, then the cops have to leave them alone,
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:31.280]  and then they get attacked and then they go to jail.
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:34.080]  Yeah, it's gotten nuts.
[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:38.080]  I mean, I'm no fan of what happened in Charlottesville, but that guy, James Fields,
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:42.240]  he got convicted of first degree murder like he planned to kill Heather Hyre.
[02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:43.200]  Yeah, premeditated.
[02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:44.800]  Right.
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:45.840]  That's ridiculous.
[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:48.560]  No, he freaked out with them beating on the car and then she had a heart attack.
[02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:49.680]  God, it's very sad.
[02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:53.520]  Then they sued me saying I said that the cameraman killed her.
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:58.320]  No, I said the left came in with all their people to clash with a lot of those Nazis were
[02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:02.480]  staged. That's come out to create a melee hoping something bad happened.
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:08.640]  But then they're like in court going, Jones says this man himself killed the, I mean,
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:09.440]  it's just crazy.
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:12.320]  And it's all this racism thing.
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:14.480]  Same reason they put the Proud Boys in jail.
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:17.600]  15 years, Rikers Islands, what they're facing because they call the jury.
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:19.120]  They're a KKK group.
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:22.800]  And the jury went, oh, and didn't even care that they showed it wasn't true.
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:25.840]  They wanted to prove they weren't Nazis.
[02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:28.240]  So it's the same thing with this judge in Virginia.
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:36.080]  I mean, literally they just go in there and they say, Jones says that the same people at
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:37.840]  this event did the stuff in Ukraine.
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:38.720]  We didn't say that.
[02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:42.800]  We say Soros funded both groups, which he did stay there.
[02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:43.840]  I'm going to come right back to you.
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:45.120]  Don't hang up, Jefferson.
[02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:46.720]  Everybody else's calls coming up.
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:59.680]  Wow, Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our Republic was in trouble in the
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:04.320]  future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually
[02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:06.560]  worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:10.720]  And today, the Communist Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago.
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:16.320]  And we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what he's doing
[02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:17.360]  in this trade war.
[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:21.200]  Once China put pressure on our farmers, that's beautiful.
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:24.720]  Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down.
[02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:29.440]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's, the world that want to intimidate people
[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:32.240]  and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:34.640]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:38.720]  The human spirit lives at info wars.com and news wars.com.
[02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:43.680]  And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light,
[02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:44.640]  the dark of the night.

[02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:05.760]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:10.720]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[02:45:13.360 --> 02:45:17.120]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam because it's a form
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:17.760]  of fascism.
[02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:22.320]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:29.120]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and info wars.
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:37.120]  First they come around with Jones, everyone else like Domino's would fall.

[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:53.920]  You can't watch this, the movie, available now at infowarsstore.com.

[02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:43.920]  here in just a moment since i mentioned maxine waters it's one thing to hear me talk about her
[02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:49.920]  at skid row but if you're a tv viewer radio listeners will hear her voice but as you see her
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:56.080]  it you just really pick up on she's so proud just like she won the blue ribbon she's such a good
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:48:01.520]  person and she's doing this good deed even though it's the blue cities where the people are doing
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:06.960]  so bad and where they set it up to bring in people and to cater to the drug addicts and all of it
[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:11.520]  to create as big an eyesore as they can to get more funding she knows damn well what she's doing
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:16.560]  and she's such a greedy monster that swindles taxpayers for decades hundreds of millions of
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:20.800]  dollars her husband 30 plus million and two different scams that they admit but because
[02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:26.400]  she's black they don't dare indict her it's incredible how the left operate so here she is on
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:32.720]  skid row let me tell you that camera cannot pick up how disgusting skid row is and how out of control
[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:38.240]  it is and the drug dealers openly flipping the cops off 150 yards from the police station
[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:43.760]  that's where it's at and now we're getting skid rows in austin they're legal anywhere and everywhere
[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:49.920]  including your front yard but not at city council just like the eu exempts its own bureaucrats from
[02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:57.280]  eu taxes yes you can't make that up these people are incredible uh so here's maxine waters
[02:48:58.480 --> 02:49:05.440]  okay i'm maxine water and i'm here uh and i'm with stephanie arnold william stephanie arnold
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:10.480]  williams and she's so creative she set up a really nice environment here but she's got all these
[02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:15.520]  educational books and guess what i just bought the book on maxine his book ten dollars i need change
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:21.520]  i need ten oh wait i need a lot more than ten dollars and we're gonna go to your calls
[02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:31.040]  i'm gonna explain this i can run this place for a year but that's a year if i don't order
[02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:34.880]  more product i can run this for a year at our current operations and maybe even expand some
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:41.200]  but then in a year we'll have to shut this place down and i'll still reach everybody and it'll be
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:45.200]  big it's just that it'll be a crew of 10 people on a crew of 50 because we do a lot of stuff behind
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:50.960]  the scenes a lot of stuff you don't know about a lot of things that uh a lot of projects we funded
[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:54.960]  over the years and i really can't even do that anymore but oh we can see our projects doing very
[02:49:54.960 --> 02:50:02.160]  well some projects i funded 100 some projects i've funded 30 but we've done a lot and i wish
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:06.720]  and i wish back in the day before they cut us off so many places that um taking all our sponsors
[02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:12.960]  away with all the harassment that i'd made more money and stored it up i didn't uh and so again
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:16.640]  we've got uh david night in the morning doing a great job you've got my broadcast you're watching
[02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:20.320]  and listening to that the war room we've got a couple new shows starting in september
[02:50:20.320 --> 02:50:25.440]  not gonna announce those yet uh but uh there it all is and word of mouth your prayer and your
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:30.080]  financial support um they're all admitting that the water is full of deadly poisons not just the
[02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:33.680]  glyphosates with the fluoride lowering our q all of it people are suddenly ordering more filters
[02:50:33.680 --> 02:50:40.240]  from us uh yeah so it's a win-win and we also have a new film that i'm in a lot of other folks are in
[02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:45.120]  it's you can't watch this it's one a whole bunch of big film awards and of course uh it's good to
[02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:49.280]  have us in your library because nowadays we're taking everything offline so it's good to have
[02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:53.760]  original books it's good to have dbds it's good to have things that you can copy and share it with
[02:50:53.760 --> 02:51:02.160]  others so you can't watch this very powerful film won major awards uh alex jones gab mcginnis
[02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:08.640]  paul joseph watson tomi robinson and laura lumar and look i look at those names laura lumars totally
[02:51:08.640 --> 02:51:13.680]  man tomi robinson's band everywhere he's in jail for free species posting pedophile rings paul joseph
[02:51:13.680 --> 02:51:20.080]  watson's a hunted man gab mcginnis all the stuff there i mean that's where we've gotten here ladies
[02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:24.720]  and gentlemen and uh i like my belly hanging out i've lost 10 pounds since then but it doesn't
[02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:29.920]  matter it's a good film and people should get it and donate to local libraries and that way you
[02:51:29.920 --> 02:51:34.720]  reach more folks i mean it'll go you go right alongside the uh the pedophile books the local
[02:51:34.720 --> 02:51:39.520]  library teaching six-year-olds how much it is fun to meet minute parks and uh being driven off in
[02:51:39.520 --> 02:51:45.280]  vans i'm about kidding we covered that yesterday again the bottom's broken out folks hell is here
[02:51:45.280 --> 02:51:49.040]  but we are here to counter it when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord
[02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:55.120]  looks up a standard against it okay who was i talking to jefferson in virginia uh go ahead
[02:51:55.120 --> 02:52:00.640]  and make your points thanks for holding thanks again alex on the funding front i'm pretty sure
[02:52:00.640 --> 02:52:05.040]  you can turn the script around on the bomb in the leftist here he set up the countering disinformation
[02:52:05.040 --> 02:52:11.440]  and propaganda act right before he left office and there's money in there in the global engagement
[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:16.560]  center for people like you to get funded from the government with grants not alone it's just a grant
[02:52:16.560 --> 02:52:21.280]  for doing what you do you just have to uh categorize all disinformation that you can recognize in
[02:52:21.280 --> 02:52:26.560]  media you already do that you know that's a good idea but you know the center was created to counter
[02:52:26.560 --> 02:52:32.240]  me so i don't know if the directors of that are going to go along with that well the president is
[02:52:32.240 --> 02:52:36.320]  not the king of the country but he is the king of the executive branch and he can direct them to do
[02:52:36.320 --> 02:52:41.520]  what he wants them to do in the executive branch so uh by the way jefferson get his get his name
[02:52:41.520 --> 02:52:46.080]  a number for the weekend show i'm going to start doing i i'm going to start doing it uh and other
[02:52:46.080 --> 02:52:50.320]  weekends it'll be other hosts but where we have guest callers on the co-host together i think
[02:52:50.320 --> 02:52:54.400]  you should be one of those guys jefferson you got a great voice i can tell you're pretty smart what
[02:52:54.400 --> 02:53:00.000]  what line of work are you in i'd rather not say but uh when your caller yesterday stewart was a
[02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:05.760]  great caller your discussion with him was was fantastic and you touched on a another solution
[02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:10.320]  which was the comprehensive annual financial reports stewart didn't want to talk about it but
[02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:15.280]  you should speak about it more often there's 80 trillion dollars sitting around in those funds
[02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:19.120]  that they're hiding from us in the second set of books and you know about it and i know about it
[02:53:20.480 --> 02:53:24.480]  and that's a subject and we need to revisit all those subjects that i covered hundreds of times but
[02:53:24.480 --> 02:53:30.480]  then just i kind of drop it like a dog finally drops it you know a dead squirrel it's caught in
[02:53:30.480 --> 02:53:34.720]  its mouth but all those old subjects that are so critical i think we should go back and cover again
[02:53:34.720 --> 02:53:39.920]  what do you think yeah i think uh if we want to expand our audience we have to go back to the
[02:53:39.920 --> 02:53:44.960]  the basics of uh what we made ourselves into here you know they call us propagandists they call us
[02:53:44.960 --> 02:53:49.280]  disinformation people but what we were trying to do is make people aware of what the big scam is
[02:53:49.840 --> 02:53:55.440]  and it's clearly going on and uh if we want more people to tune in to what we're saying we got to
[02:53:55.440 --> 02:54:01.680]  go build on the foundation i hear you well hey if you want to be part of that show i've told my crew
[02:54:01.680 --> 02:54:05.040]  we've got to start it within the next two weeks i keep saying i'm going to do it i still come in
[02:54:05.040 --> 02:54:10.240]  every weekend and do shows so we're we're intending to launch saturdays i think i think the best time
[02:54:10.240 --> 02:54:13.760]  would probably be in the afternoon and that way people that you know want to go out at night
[02:54:13.760 --> 02:54:17.440]  and still go out at night but we can do it live and then archive it people to watch saturday night
[02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:21.840]  and just have a roundtable discussion each week with like five or six callers maybe have a group
[02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:25.840]  of 20 people we have that we rotate through and i just think it'll be something really really exciting
[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:31.120]  thank you so much for the call god bless you that's got a smart name and number if you want to
[02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:34.720]  do the show uh all these callers are smart that's why we're taking them but uh these are really
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:40.080]  smart callers today who's been holding the longest next that would be brian in texas and then we'll
[02:54:40.080 --> 02:54:46.240]  go to uh christ and others brian you're on the air thanks for holding hey i live here in austin
[02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:52.640]  i've called before i used to work in music and rock and roll and all that i wanted to say yesterday
[02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:58.400]  i got an info wars original for you i want to use a music analogy for the current political
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:02.560]  situation that also gets into what you were talking about today with the chemicals and the
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:09.600]  additives and everything that these clown world democrats you know you hosted the show we know
[02:55:09.600 --> 02:55:16.480]  what it is they're like the goofball pop stars an american idol begging for simon cowell's approval
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:21.040]  while trump is the greatest punk rocker of all time you know recording his own records
[02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:26.400]  booking his own tours playing what people want he exists outside the system he's the president
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:30.720]  but he's not the man right it's the same thing we can also use the you can also use the elbows
[02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:34.960]  to the led zeppelin analogy because if anybody that knows rock history they wrote their own book
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:39.120]  they called the shots and pretty much nobody else ever did even the beetles couldn't really call
[02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:46.560]  their own shots no very few of them do and even if they have the ability to there's other factors
[02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:51.120]  in play and so when you had all the stuff on the desk today you know all the different mouth
[02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:56.480]  washes and all that it's the same thing you don't have to get crest and cold gate just because
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:56:01.280]  it's on the shelf in the store there are other options there you know you but you've got to
[02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:07.520]  seek you've got to seek those options out absolutely so it's just don't go with the flow
[02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:13.120]  no matter what you do and where you are don't go with the flow and every you made a comment earlier
[02:56:13.120 --> 02:56:18.000]  about why do these people think the gay thing's so great hey there's an old chris rock joke if
[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:22.400]  everyone had a gay cousin that he was gay before he knew who gay was you were playing basketball
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:27.760]  and he was skipping rope it's just a natural thing god bless you but all these people that
[02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:33.680]  are with so liberal it's so enlightened they do this as a substitute for a personality
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:37.840]  they can't stand on their own two feet so they do that identity politics well that's that plus
[02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:43.280]  exactly they've they've added a leftist globalist position on the identity of being gay so of course
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:48.240]  they want you to now be gay and really it's about not having children depopulating if people don't
[02:56:48.240 --> 02:56:54.080]  want to have kids that's their issue i'm not saying they're bad that's a total issue of whatever
[02:56:54.080 --> 02:56:59.760]  some people can't have kids so and to act like the country that's been the most open and liberal
[02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:05.280]  towards everybody is the bad country when america's led the way in empowering people
[02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:08.880]  they're using our strength against us i bless you i appreciate your call hey
[02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:17.200]  but i'm telling you the lgbtp community now is pedophilic it's evil and i will oppose it
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:22.720]  i will absolutely oppose it i mean i oppose jeffrey ebbstein trying to have sex with 10-year-old
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:27.600]  girls i'm believing they got younger than that and i oppose you know some pervert homosexual
[02:57:27.600 --> 02:57:32.640]  who wants to have sex with a little boy it's disgusting and it's evil keep your damn hands

[02:58:42.640 --> 02:58:48.960]  alex yes i got a plug for the patriot point second oh thanks i got 180
[02:58:48.960 --> 02:58:53.280]  dollars so far this year and i feel like i'm stealing from you i buy so much in the store
[02:58:53.280 --> 02:58:55.920]  because i mean i don't want to get that money to walmart i don't want to give that money to
[02:58:55.920 --> 02:58:59.760]  people are going to donate it to causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to you
[02:58:59.760 --> 02:59:03.760]  and i'm getting quality products the products that i do receive have changed my life i mean
[02:59:03.760 --> 02:59:08.240]  the x2 has really done a lot for me i've lost weight my brain works a whole lot better i think
[02:59:08.240 --> 02:59:12.800]  my kids they use the toothpaste my son used to get these little sore throats and he puts
[02:59:12.800 --> 02:59:17.120]  x2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore throat uh he loves let me break this down for
[02:59:17.120 --> 02:59:21.760]  you i want high quality stuff in there i want a good price but i've kind of habituated everybody
[02:59:21.760 --> 02:59:26.560]  to where everybody buys when it's 50 off i'm making two dollars on the toothpaste 50 off and so
[02:59:26.560 --> 02:59:30.480]  it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth thank you so much for
[02:59:30.480 --> 02:59:34.720]  the plugs but listen when people get the patriot points a lot of times it makes things a loss
[02:59:34.720 --> 02:59:38.720]  later because if you're already getting 10 off because you're on auto ship then we're doing
[02:59:38.720 --> 02:59:43.040]  50 off and then you do something like that uh we have patriot points we lose money but that's
[02:59:43.040 --> 03:00:05.520]  okay thanks for the support you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:05.520 --> 03:00:14.320]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[03:00:14.320 --> 03:00:18.400]  all right we're an hour on the floor and i mainly hit on fluoride now they admit it's
[03:00:18.400 --> 03:00:26.560]  causing massive IQ reductions and cancer it's insane it's insane and they know it and it's
[03:00:26.560 --> 03:00:33.200]  not like prop 65 or they say you know like one billionth the piece of lead kills you and it's
[03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:38.400]  it's a fraud it's the left saying fluoridate fluoridate it's super high toxic levels that
[03:00:38.400 --> 03:00:44.720]  they know hurts you and they're going oh but a factory is putting out carbon dioxide it's deadly
[03:00:44.720 --> 03:00:50.720]  plants breathe it they claim they're the environmentalist they claim they're the guardians of humans
[03:00:50.720 --> 03:00:55.760]  but the left can't talk can't talk about how they want to kill everybody well these callers have been
[03:00:56.800 --> 03:01:00.800]  super awesome they're always great but man these are some great calls
[03:01:00.800 --> 03:01:05.760]  chris denis chris david chris joseph will get to all the other than mike adams has taken over

[03:01:10.400 --> 03:01:15.040]  segment but right now he's been holding longest now chris in illinois then we'll go to david
[03:01:15.040 --> 03:01:20.960]  and others go ahead chris hey alex uh you know i've been selling water filtration here in
[03:01:20.960 --> 03:01:27.040]  chicago for about 12 years and i recently have seen more calls for ro filtration which actually
[03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:32.480]  removes the fluoride we offer something that actually puts the minerals back in after
[03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:37.920]  it's all filtration so that's good news um and then one other point real quick about the
[03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:41.760]  well let me just stop you because people ask me what's the best water filtration this is important
[03:01:41.760 --> 03:01:46.800]  the best thing is reverse osmosis cuts out a hundred percent as you know it's set up properly
[03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:51.600]  very inexpensive and that's what i use for cooking but you better add the minerals back in that's
[03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:56.320]  critical because if you drink only distilled water or only reverse osmosis you get some major
[03:01:56.320 --> 03:02:02.720]  problems from that right yes sir that's the fact um we actually do a post treatment that
[03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:06.400]  puts like 20 minerals back in and that's the good news is you're only getting the good minerals
[03:02:06.400 --> 03:02:10.960]  because most minerals that are already in the water raw are bound to other chemicals and toxins
[03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:16.240]  so that's why it's critical to just take everything out correct and you know the thing is that we get
[03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:22.000]  a lot of calls into the office people want ro they're becoming more educated oh i mean today
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:27.280]  i've had three conversations with people that that have said i want the fluoride out of the water
[03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:32.320]  essentially so ro is the best way to go except or distilled if you add good minerals back it
[03:02:32.320 --> 03:02:36.480]  just better be the right thing that's why i just go with gravity feds because they cut out all the
[03:02:36.480 --> 03:02:40.240]  toxic chemicals leave some of the minerals and so if people don't know what they're doing it's
[03:02:40.240 --> 03:02:45.520]  the best system i literally morally think about the best systems we also sell reverse osmosis
[03:02:45.520 --> 03:02:49.520]  we've just got to notice about it because of course you explain to people though you better
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:56.160]  add the minerals back that is correct yeah because or i mean it strips it down to hydrogen and oxygen
[03:02:56.160 --> 03:03:01.760]  the two elements of water oh you want absolutely pure water it's it's reverse osmosis that's my
[03:03:01.760 --> 03:03:07.760]  own research but i'm sorry to keep interrupting what's your main point well so um you know the
[03:03:07.760 --> 03:03:12.080]  hunt that movie the hunt i don't know uh if you covered this i'm sorry i haven't been able to
[03:03:12.080 --> 03:03:18.160]  listen a lot but you know dick chaney was in kathy o bryan's book uh about he how he the most dangerous
[03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:26.080]  game the most dangerous game and so i i've been calling list chaney's office and uh asking them
[03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:32.240]  about it and and they don't really like me calling and asking them but i mean that you know it's it's
[03:03:32.240 --> 03:03:38.800]  it's not that uh you know i just don't understand why these things are occurring but it still seems
[03:03:38.800 --> 03:03:44.640]  out of the realm of possibility for people and it's actually happened already with a vice president
[03:03:44.640 --> 03:03:50.880]  of ours you know hunting people and you know a lot of folks don't understand that hunting people's
[03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:56.960]  been done the romans did it the babelonians did it uh hunting uh folks is a very old deal
[03:03:57.680 --> 03:04:02.080]  and it goes back to sometimes you let prisoners go or gladiators go and then run them through swamps
[03:04:02.080 --> 03:04:08.320]  and things and so truth is stranger than fiction great points anything else that's it keep it up man
[03:04:08.320 --> 03:04:15.680]  love you guys love you too brother yeah you know that piece that uh greg reese put together was
[03:04:15.680 --> 03:04:20.960]  powerful but i i encouraged him i said go back and do a bigger one with ewing cameron who asked
[03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:29.600]  about her ewing cameron who actually ran the mk ultra program and it was declassified in 77 that
[03:04:29.600 --> 03:04:37.760]  he had kidnapped more than 10 000 children and taken them mainly to canada and uh also new york
[03:04:38.720 --> 03:04:45.600]  and turned them into robots i mean they were totally programmed and that was in the 60s and
[03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:49.440]  70s he did that and that's what they do this is really real folks
[03:04:53.200 --> 03:04:58.240]  one half of the incredible eight pack power stack the am wake up and work package is exactly what

[03:05:48.160 --> 03:06:00.400]  miss info wars like product
[03:06:04.960 --> 03:06:09.280]  ladies and gentlemen we're an hour number four coming in mike adams the health ranger natural
[03:06:09.280 --> 03:06:15.040]  news dot com more your calls here in a moment i have two clips i want to play one of these i had
[03:06:15.040 --> 03:06:19.680]  the idea today when i was talking about fluorides like a weapon targeting children they admitted
[03:06:19.680 --> 03:06:23.200]  it should i show the documents of all the new studies and this big awakening people are like oh
[03:06:23.200 --> 03:06:28.240]  my god you're right incredible how is what you said come true again i show people seven or eight
[03:06:28.240 --> 03:06:34.480]  other big harvard studies mexican national government studies chinese studies german studies
[03:06:34.480 --> 03:06:41.760]  saying the exact same thing i mean these studies are done well kids just drinking fluoride a year
[03:06:41.760 --> 03:06:52.000]  here lowers it about a point a year wow wow wow and that's just what's in the water it's much
[03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:58.800]  stronger in toothpaste but uh i said it's like darts vader like you know shooting and targeting
[03:06:59.680 --> 03:07:03.760]  the kids are or you know predator i mean this is a weapon system like on a box of
[03:07:05.280 --> 03:07:11.440]  shells for hunting varmints if it's for coyotes it shows a coyote if it's for prairie dogs it
[03:07:11.440 --> 03:07:16.880]  shows a prairie dog if it if it's for white-tailed deer it shows a white-tailed deer it's for a moose
[03:07:16.880 --> 03:07:23.600]  shows a moose well on the fluoride box of the fluoride water is a baby because that's the
[03:07:23.600 --> 03:07:31.600]  target it's a baby's brain so here's that quick clip if you took your six month old baby and dropped
[03:07:31.600 --> 03:07:36.480]  it on its head on purpose you would lose that child if you were seen doing it and you should
[03:07:37.600 --> 03:07:40.960]  if you're wondering why it's like a zombie apocalypse out there and why there's mental
[03:07:40.960 --> 03:07:48.240]  illness everywhere and why people seem so incredibly stupid it's because the soviets
[03:07:49.200 --> 03:07:58.080]  the communist the the proto-globalist a globalist that took over had work camps and they put
[03:07:59.120 --> 03:08:06.320]  hydrofluorosalic acid in the water and lots of other stuff to test it on the people in the
[03:08:06.320 --> 03:08:12.400]  gulags i went to h e b this morning the crew did walked right in it says h e b
[03:08:14.320 --> 03:08:21.840]  baby fluoride water let's zoom right in on that and notice it shows you the target it's kind of
[03:08:21.840 --> 03:08:32.320]  like buying a box of 30 odd six rifle shells rifle rounds and on the covers of deer there's a little
[03:08:32.320 --> 03:08:44.320]  crosshair on the side of the deer
[03:08:48.320 --> 03:08:49.440]  target maximum five
[03:08:49.440 --> 03:08:59.760]  five oh i mean oh baby it's time to kill brain cells
[03:09:01.680 --> 03:09:08.960]  so much more fun to take our time and then it's bye bye brain and you've got a good automaton
[03:09:08.960 --> 03:09:19.760]  wow that's scary as hell because it's all real folks but there's the cognitive dissidence that
[03:09:19.760 --> 03:09:23.680]  the white house science are wrote this huge book about putting fluoride in the water to
[03:09:23.680 --> 03:09:30.080]  brain damage you 45 years ago it's published the year i was born ecoscience and it's like well
[03:09:30.080 --> 03:09:34.800]  oh five g to admit is way worse than kill us okay bye bye i die
[03:09:34.800 --> 03:09:39.680]  bye there'll be these marathons to raise money for everybody getting brain tumors
[03:09:40.640 --> 03:09:44.480]  instead of just stopping it not letting these people do it but we until we admit
[03:09:44.480 --> 03:09:47.920]  they're a bunch of eugenicist devil worshipers it's only gonna get worse
[03:09:49.280 --> 03:09:55.200]  yes a gang of psychotics took over our government that's why they don't want
[03:09:55.200 --> 03:09:57.440]  trump getting into everything because they've done so many crimes
[03:09:57.440 --> 03:10:01.920]  okay let's go to your calls
[03:10:03.840 --> 03:10:08.240]  Dennis in virginia and then we'll go to uh david and chris and everybody else
[03:10:08.240 --> 03:10:14.000]  Dennis in virginia thanks for holding hey alex thanks for having me on again yeah i just saw
[03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:19.760]  your clip on a maxine waters and i tell you she epitomizes the effects of fluoride toxication
[03:10:21.840 --> 03:10:25.280]  yeah she didn't she's sitting with a homeless lady trying to sell books help the homeless community
[03:10:25.280 --> 03:10:29.200]  and she wants her change back she's she's worth i think she's worth like a hundred million or
[03:10:29.200 --> 03:10:34.160]  something herself and she wanted to give the lady at ten dollars she's way out there and i
[03:10:34.160 --> 03:10:39.600]  like i need change i'm not giving her ten extra dollars and these producers before i mean they're
[03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:44.480]  making billions of dollars for pumping the poisons that you know and oh i forgot we get to pay i've
[03:10:44.480 --> 03:10:51.280]  seen that i think austin pays three million a year for the poison it's crazy you know and it's
[03:10:51.280 --> 03:10:55.440]  it's uh all the things you said and you know not you know i asked a lot of friends of mine said
[03:10:55.440 --> 03:11:00.160]  would you brush your teeth with uh arsenic and said well no i said well fluoride is only slightly
[03:11:00.160 --> 03:11:05.120]  less toxic than arsenic so why would you brush your teeth with it you know and it binds with
[03:11:05.120 --> 03:11:11.520]  metals in the brain causing dementia alzheimer's and it uh and watching your program about fluoride
[03:11:11.520 --> 03:11:17.120]  before you know how it competes with iodine i started using your x3 and i got about a month ago
[03:11:17.120 --> 03:11:21.680]  now kind of skeptical on a lot of products out there but yours everything i've ever got from
[03:11:21.680 --> 03:11:26.400]  you guys i mean it's been right on and the x3 i mean i can really tell the difference it took
[03:11:26.400 --> 03:11:31.680]  probably like 10 days to start kicking in but because of what i've learned from uh fluoride
[03:11:31.680 --> 03:11:36.960]  being a halogen and competing with iodine as a thyroid and how it affects the body it's like you
[03:11:36.960 --> 03:11:39.920]  know i'm telling you i'm going to give it a try and it really works and i got your electro pure
[03:11:39.920 --> 03:11:44.720]  water filter too just you know just uh brother we wouldn't be here but wasn't for you but yeah
[03:11:44.720 --> 03:11:49.280]  good clean iodine is a whole other world and it's just amazing what it does god bless you i
[03:11:49.280 --> 03:11:53.760]  appreciate the call okay let's go to david in california thanks for holding you're on the
[03:11:53.760 --> 03:11:57.440]  air with another plug i appreciate all the plugging but this all goes together like
[03:11:57.440 --> 03:12:03.360]  the krill oil is what makes the blood brain barrier stronger and it's what the brain works off of i
[03:12:03.360 --> 03:12:08.080]  mean i get high off these and i'm not into drugs i haven't you know i might smoke marijuana once a
[03:12:08.080 --> 03:12:13.360]  year i haven't done anything since like college i tried a few things but i take krill oil and
[03:12:13.360 --> 03:12:19.600]  fish oil before i go to bed because i sleep deeper i have incredible dreams and the studies
[03:12:19.600 --> 03:12:27.600]  are there uh go ahead uh david thanks for calling i just wanted to plug uh the honor roll real quick
[03:12:28.480 --> 03:12:33.920]  i just my son just started school a few weeks ago and the first week was kind of rough for him and
[03:12:34.560 --> 03:12:38.960]  got him going on the honor roll about the end of that week and sure enough the following week and
[03:12:38.960 --> 03:12:44.960]  the weeks after that were just the just your improvement like none other so i really think
[03:12:44.960 --> 03:12:50.160]  that uh he's really benefiting off the honor roll well don't you know the old wives tale for hundreds
[03:12:50.160 --> 03:12:56.960]  of years my my mother's mother would make her take cod oil every morning before school and she
[03:12:56.960 --> 03:13:01.040]  literally grabbed her by the nose when she was littler say you know take it but that's what you
[03:13:01.040 --> 03:13:06.720]  do mothers knew mothers used to put a little bit of cod oil in baby milk once the baby was six months
[03:13:06.720 --> 03:13:11.520]  old well no we don't do that anymore and the iqs are going straight down there's an article on that
[03:13:11.520 --> 03:13:19.120]  sorry go ahead yeah um not all not not just that but uh ultimate fish oil as well it's been helping
[03:13:19.120 --> 03:13:25.760]  me out um just putting words together and kind of being able to communicate a lot better um
[03:13:26.400 --> 03:13:32.400]  putting ideas and whatnot together but um mainly i just wanted to just touch on the whole uh
[03:13:32.400 --> 03:13:39.440]  fluoride thing i mean it's kind of it's just it really sad when you know you walk into a walmart
[03:13:39.440 --> 03:13:46.880]  and you see rows and rows of this you know water that got added fluoride on it and then it's
[03:13:46.880 --> 03:13:53.360]  clearly got a picture of a baby on it you know i mean most people aren't even going to go out and
[03:13:53.360 --> 03:13:57.680]  and and look at the label see what's actually in it they're just going to see water in a baby and
[03:13:57.680 --> 03:14:04.560]  say oh man here we go this is exactly what i needed and i mean it just there it's sad because it's
[03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:10.320]  only making this a lot worse i just barely started researching and and started looking into this uh
[03:14:10.320 --> 03:14:14.640]  what fluoride actually does and it's all because of you and and everything you you've you know you've
[03:14:14.640 --> 03:14:18.720]  put out there and brother it's not because of me and i'm not saying this to disagree with you
[03:14:19.360 --> 03:14:24.160]  do you understand it is you the listener that has spread the word that already knows all this too
[03:14:24.160 --> 03:14:28.240]  i'm just covering stuff it's all public knowledge it's you that carries the ball thanks to you
[03:14:28.880 --> 03:14:33.120]  i bless you i appreciate your call david oh we had one more drag queen story i wouldn't get to

[03:14:36.960 --> 03:14:42.000]  play that clip we go to mike adams next segment and from australia and they only gave this dude
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:48.960]  six years he comes in attacks everybody with axes hacks their heads in people are deformed for life
[03:14:48.960 --> 03:14:57.120]  they survive tax a black lady tax some white dudes and you know he walks over to what looks like a

[03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:02.720]  in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground close to reality
[03:19:02.720 --> 03:19:06.640]  who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation and today the communist
[03:19:06.640 --> 03:19:13.040]  chinese have banned all u.s farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls
[03:19:13.040 --> 03:19:18.240]  support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once china put pressure on our
[03:19:18.240 --> 03:19:23.120]  farmers that's beautiful americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down
[03:19:23.680 --> 03:19:28.400]  so to the walking cruises and the hillary clinton's the world that want to intimidate people
[03:19:28.400 --> 03:19:32.960]  and tell us to back down we're never going to give up and all you've done is awaken the human
[03:19:32.960 --> 03:19:38.800]  spirit and the human spirit lives at info wars dot com and news wars dot com and i'm asking listeners
[03:19:38.800 --> 03:19:44.000]  whatever you do spread those links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:51.040]  resistance we are 1776 worldwide
[03:19:51.040 --> 03:20:07.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:07.280 --> 03:20:23.520]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[03:20:37.280 --> 03:20:57.120]  so i married an ax murder we make jokes about this but in australia a man you read the court
[03:20:57.120 --> 03:21:02.640]  file it's like this woman attacked people randomly with axes but it's a man
[03:21:02.640 --> 03:21:08.640]  and we're all supposed to play along with this mental illness so this man was only given six
[03:21:08.640 --> 03:21:15.200]  years for to tag people for no reason start rolling the video plays and for tv viewers and the higher
[03:21:15.200 --> 03:21:19.440]  court said no you're going to get more time because the left had said well this person is a victim
[03:21:19.440 --> 03:21:24.640]  he's allowed to go around as a protected class and just randomly come into stores and try to
[03:21:24.640 --> 03:21:30.480]  menace people and then nobody was scared because they're all trendies and they was just normal
[03:21:30.480 --> 03:21:37.040]  and so starts hacking him in the face and we'll go to the article as we show this video and show
[03:21:37.040 --> 03:21:45.040]  the folks in the hospital with the huge hatchet cuts out of their eyes and noses and faces like
[03:21:45.040 --> 03:21:49.840]  hey how's it going what's going on oh really a girl that i asked out didn't go out with me
[03:21:50.480 --> 03:21:58.720]  and so i'm a protected group i'm gonna attack you and bam acts in the face and they actually
[03:21:58.720 --> 03:22:03.360]  shed the court this is a trans person they're allowed to do this they only need six years
[03:22:03.360 --> 03:22:08.240]  well higher court said no that's wrong it was a public interest that's very rare where the
[03:22:08.240 --> 03:22:15.840]  higher court came down and took over the case and said this is wrong you need to spend the rest of
[03:22:15.840 --> 03:22:24.000]  your life in prison and again the clip boom full power acts in the head talk about swinging like a
[03:22:24.000 --> 03:22:32.320]  boy for it's hacking that trendy and the left said read the transcript said this is allowed
[03:22:33.040 --> 03:22:38.800]  we're gonna have sex with your kids we're gonna put fluoride in your water because
[03:22:38.800 --> 03:22:42.320]  folks have got to think they're gonna get somewhere greater they chemically sterilize
[03:22:43.200 --> 03:22:47.680]  doesn't look like that guy chemically sterilized maybe he was injected in some testosterone

[03:24:19.520 --> 03:24:26.080]  film mike adams taken over uh mike what do you make of the bottom falling out you've covered the
[03:24:26.080 --> 03:24:30.640]  hundreds of studies natural news dot com like no other think you've been the number one on that
[03:24:30.640 --> 03:24:36.000]  all the scientists all the toxicologists the fda scientists saying get flow right out why suddenly
[03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:41.360]  with this new jama study that it's hurting boys more than ever causing massive acu reductions why
[03:24:41.360 --> 03:24:44.880]  suddenly are people saying we're vindicated because i know if i'm getting these calls
[03:24:44.880 --> 03:24:49.040]  you own a big lab to test this stuff you're getting more calls than i'm getting i mean are
[03:24:49.040 --> 03:24:53.120]  are you getting the vindication calls and why now because this is just one of hundreds of studies
[03:24:54.000 --> 03:24:58.000]  well that's right my phone's been blowing up too about the publication of this article but look
[03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:03.600]  you know alex you you were 20 years ahead of the journal of the american medical association so
[03:25:03.600 --> 03:25:09.040]  number one where is the national apology to info wars and natural news and all the others
[03:25:09.040 --> 03:25:12.800]  in independent media who've covered this right because we've been warning about this for over
[03:25:12.800 --> 03:25:16.640]  two decades i know you in particular alex you were ahead of this and you were covering this
[03:25:16.640 --> 03:25:21.600]  in the 1990s and warning people about it and uh you know of course they just call everybody a
[03:25:21.600 --> 03:25:26.480]  conspiracy theory until one day suddenly it's in the journal of the american medical association
[03:25:26.480 --> 03:25:32.320]  oh you were right the whole time but the other part of this and by the way look we're just right
[03:25:32.320 --> 03:25:35.520]  because it's on its face but you're actually an engineer and scientists and you have scientists
[03:25:35.520 --> 03:25:40.320]  working for you we specifically said it targets boys african-americans even more and that it's
[03:25:40.320 --> 03:25:45.360]  causing bone cancer as well and lowering IQ and exactly what we've been saying is exactly what
[03:25:45.360 --> 03:25:51.840]  they found and they said it's a very stringent in-depth very deep study well i'm i'm gonna add
[03:25:51.840 --> 03:25:56.800]  to that also today you're exactly right but i've got another study here just published uh from
[03:25:56.800 --> 03:26:02.800]  christopher xley a researcher in the uk prescription infant formulas are intentionally
[03:26:02.800 --> 03:26:09.600]  contaminated with aluminum wow another neurotoxic and guess what the formulas that are marketed
[03:26:09.600 --> 03:26:15.440]  to prevent asthma and and you know for sensitive babies they have the most aluminum in them and
[03:26:15.440 --> 03:26:19.680]  let's stop right there actually this is an admitted eugenics program the bear documents
[03:26:19.680 --> 03:26:25.040]  came out 12 years ago that they knew hiv was in their factory product on purpose and they said
[03:26:25.040 --> 03:26:29.200]  well we're getting rid of hemophiliacs so these are very cold-blooded people can you speak to
[03:26:29.200 --> 03:26:34.400]  the mindset the key is this is on purpose yeah well i actually what i'm going to do today is
[03:26:34.400 --> 03:26:40.000]  connect the dots about how this is a war on not just humanity but you notice that all of these
[03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:47.200]  vectors that are attacking people they tend to attack young black males this is a eugenics war
[03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:54.400]  on young black males so vaccines cause autism at much higher rates in young black male infants
[03:26:54.400 --> 03:26:59.600]  right and then of course not only do vaccines have aluminum but then the infant formula has
[03:26:59.600 --> 03:27:04.400]  aluminum and now we know that fluoride attacks males more than females as well and then we of
[03:27:04.400 --> 03:27:10.080]  course we have abortion and infanticide and i say the number one target right now of the
[03:27:10.080 --> 03:27:14.560]  establishment which is the science establishment the medical establishment the abortion industry
[03:27:14.560 --> 03:27:20.960]  and the globalist is that they want to mass murder black people everywhere around the world
[03:27:20.960 --> 03:27:25.680]  and as i'll mention i'll cover today how this goes back decades when they wanted to put infertility
[03:27:25.680 --> 03:27:30.640]  chemicals into the food supply by the way this is not your opinion when they set up the the eugenics
[03:27:30.640 --> 03:27:38.480]  boards the the the the city health departments that was set up under the eugenicist and racial hygiene
[03:27:38.480 --> 03:27:42.400]  and so that's why the left puts out all this race stuff saying oh if you want blacks to be
[03:27:42.400 --> 03:27:47.840]  successful you're racist they want blacks under their control so they never saw what hit them well
[03:27:47.840 --> 03:27:53.280]  yeah and and they absolutely remember that the attack on neurology is an attack on human freedom
[03:27:53.280 --> 03:27:58.080]  and they the globalists in the establishment they want especially they want black people
[03:27:58.080 --> 03:28:03.280]  to be neurologically damaged so they can be easily controlled by people like mad maxine
[03:28:03.280 --> 03:28:08.560]  i mean they want to be able to control black populations to force feed them disinformation
[03:28:08.560 --> 03:28:14.320]  and hate to whip up race wars all over america while they're forcing black people to live in
[03:28:14.320 --> 03:28:19.840]  poverty and rat infested liberal cities that are collapsing all around them they want to
[03:28:19.840 --> 03:28:26.160]  brain damage alex this is a this is a modern day chemical weapons plantation enforcement system
[03:28:26.160 --> 03:28:31.120]  it's nothing less than that that's it blacks particularly targeted but they've done studies
[03:28:31.120 --> 03:28:36.160]  too like they find these city water supplies that the mainly black areas suddenly have higher
[03:28:36.160 --> 03:28:41.680]  levels they don't know why no they're adding more to hit them oh but you'll never hear mad maxine
[03:28:41.680 --> 03:28:46.800]  talk about that because she's a plantation owner she's a house slave to kill the black people
[03:28:46.800 --> 03:28:54.240]  literally planned parenthood set up to kill black people as well heart disease is on the rise clogged

[03:31:00.560 --> 03:31:05.520]  ground close to reality who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation and
[03:31:05.520 --> 03:31:11.600]  today the communist chinese have banned all u.s farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive
[03:31:11.600 --> 03:31:17.200]  increases in polls support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once china
[03:31:17.200 --> 03:31:22.240]  put pressure on our farmers that's beautiful americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't
[03:31:22.240 --> 03:31:27.200]  going to back down so to the walking cruises and the hillary clinton's the world that want to
[03:31:27.200 --> 03:31:31.920]  intimidate people and tell us to back down we're never going to give up and all you've done is
[03:31:31.920 --> 03:31:37.520]  awaken the human spirit and the human spirit lives at info wars dot com and news wars dot com
[03:31:37.520 --> 03:31:42.880]  and i'm asking listeners whatever you do spread those links because we are the light the dark of
[03:31:42.880 --> 03:31:54.560]  the night we are the resistance we are 1776 worldwide it's not only that you have a unique
[03:31:54.560 --> 03:31:58.960]  voice in the public arena in the public square the other thing that's unique about info wars is
[03:31:58.960 --> 03:32:03.840]  is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate
[03:32:03.840 --> 03:32:08.320]  sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by secrets foreign
[03:32:08.320 --> 03:32:13.840]  government it is completely independent of all that it is an old school american 1776 style
[03:32:13.840 --> 03:32:18.080]  experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the
[03:32:18.080 --> 03:32:22.240]  founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support and
[03:32:22.240 --> 03:32:26.560]  subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then
[03:32:26.560 --> 03:32:30.640]  ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or
[03:32:30.640 --> 03:32:35.280]  billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the
[03:32:35.280 --> 03:32:40.000]  persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that
[03:32:40.000 --> 03:32:44.320]  the uh that they are the bridge from the of founding to the modern age ultimate american
[03:32:44.320 --> 03:32:48.400]  democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the black
[03:32:48.400 --> 03:33:06.000]  warming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:06.000 --> 03:33:18.400]  on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones with mike adams black americans have every right
[03:33:18.400 --> 03:33:24.560]  to be beyond angry generations of chemical assaults that have been waged against them
[03:33:24.560 --> 03:33:30.160]  heavy metals assault but you know it's not right to be angry just at least like in a black lives
[03:33:30.160 --> 03:33:36.320]  matter kind of way the real enemies of black america are the science establishment the dental
[03:33:36.320 --> 03:33:41.600]  industry the medical industry and that's what i'm going to explain here in this segment they are
[03:33:41.600 --> 03:33:47.840]  literally trying to annihilate to mass murder black people all across america and if they can't
[03:33:47.840 --> 03:33:54.560]  murder you they want to damage your brains to cause confusion to cause lowered iqs they want
[03:33:54.560 --> 03:34:00.240]  to kill your babies or convince you to kill your own babies this is what's going on this all begins
[03:34:00.240 --> 03:34:04.880]  with of course the big breaking news journal of the american medical association a pediatric
[03:34:05.600 --> 03:34:11.600]  version of that talking about how of course fluoride now is known to lower the iqs of children
[03:34:12.320 --> 03:34:17.920]  especially affecting males more than females when women are pregnant that's the study and
[03:34:17.920 --> 03:34:26.080]  they consume fluoride then it damages the brains of the developing babies the unborn babies now if
[03:34:26.080 --> 03:34:31.200]  that baby survives the abortion advocates that want to mass murder everything that's born alive by the
[03:34:31.200 --> 03:34:36.880]  way then that baby will go on to suffer extreme brain damage or lowered iqs depending on their
[03:34:36.880 --> 03:34:42.400]  level of exposure now the establishment doesn't stop at that this is remember this is a massive
[03:34:42.400 --> 03:34:49.840]  chemical weapons assault on all humans but especially african americans and i guess africans
[03:34:49.840 --> 03:34:56.240]  all around the world but they then well they they want to put mercury fillings in the mouths of
[03:34:56.240 --> 03:35:02.080]  black children the dental industry pushes that the same dental industry that pushes the fluoride
[03:35:02.080 --> 03:35:07.280]  they also push mercury fillings of course they don't call them mercury right they call them
[03:35:07.280 --> 03:35:13.760]  a silver or amalgam but they're about 50 percent mercury mercury is another neurotoxin just like
[03:35:13.760 --> 03:35:20.240]  fluoride is a neurotoxin and guess what black children get more mercury fillings than white
[03:35:20.240 --> 03:35:26.400]  children you know why because dentists have a slogan especially especially in inner cities
[03:35:26.400 --> 03:35:31.600]  where it's all paid by insurance or you know medicaid or medicare type of coverage they call it
[03:35:31.600 --> 03:35:38.960]  drill fill and bill it's about billing the government for as much money as you can by
[03:35:38.960 --> 03:35:45.280]  drilling and filling as many holes as you can create sometimes or or diagnose in the teeth
[03:35:45.280 --> 03:35:51.440]  of young inner city black children and so they they drill fill and bill they drill and then
[03:35:51.440 --> 03:35:55.920]  they fill it with mercury and then they build the government so this is another mass poisoning
[03:35:55.920 --> 03:36:01.440]  that's taking place especially of low income black americans in the inner cities and dentists
[03:36:01.440 --> 03:36:06.560]  are making a killing doing that in the inner cities by the way there's also a huge cancer
[03:36:06.560 --> 03:36:12.240]  industry that makes money off of black people in inner cities like detroit for example where there
[03:36:12.240 --> 03:36:16.880]  are massive cancer scams where they falsely diagnose every black person with cancer even
[03:36:16.880 --> 03:36:23.840]  when they don't have it in fact one one doctor dr feride fatah was actually arrested by the fbi
[03:36:24.560 --> 03:36:30.400]  charged prosecuted and i think he's in prison for 24 years or something like that because he
[03:36:30.400 --> 03:36:36.240]  ran a massive cancer scam giving chemotherapy chemotherapy to black people who didn't even
[03:36:36.240 --> 03:36:41.520]  have cancer that was his scam and of course targeting black people in order to accomplish that
[03:36:42.320 --> 03:36:49.680]  so let's see we've got that chemotherapy targeting black people it's also aluminum
[03:36:50.400 --> 03:36:56.160]  so there's a new study that just came out i promise to bring in today it's called prescription
[03:36:56.160 --> 03:37:03.440]  infant formulas are contaminated with aluminum uh the spelling is british so it's aluminium
[03:37:03.440 --> 03:37:09.040]  in term if you're looking for that online and it's by christopher xley and other researchers this
[03:37:09.040 --> 03:37:13.760]  was published in the international journal of environmental research and public health and
[03:37:13.760 --> 03:37:20.720]  it shows of course that these prescription infant formulas are loaded with aluminum and in fact there's
[03:37:20.720 --> 03:37:28.560]  more aluminum in the formulas that are determined to be of use to infants who are who have allergies
[03:37:28.560 --> 03:37:34.640]  so sensitive infants are subjected to more aluminum than the regular infant formulas
[03:37:34.640 --> 03:37:40.240]  so this just came out aluminum is neurotoxic by the way so why are they putting it into
[03:37:40.240 --> 03:37:45.840]  infant formulas to feed to babies and these are prescription formulas that are prescribed by doctors
[03:37:45.840 --> 03:37:52.720]  okay now on on top of that you've got aluminum in the vaccines now aluminum in vaccines of course
[03:37:52.720 --> 03:37:59.120]  is another neurotoxic chemical on top of the mercury in vaccines for you starting to see
[03:37:59.120 --> 03:38:05.600]  a pattern here and they want the black babies especially to get vaccinated with as many injections
[03:38:05.600 --> 03:38:12.080]  at the youngest age possible even though a whistleblower who worked for the cdc i think he's still
[03:38:12.080 --> 03:38:19.520]  there a top scientist at the cdc blew the whistle a couple years ago went public posted a statement
[03:38:19.520 --> 03:38:25.920]  with his attorney saying that he was part of a massive scientific cover-up at the cdc where
[03:38:25.920 --> 03:38:31.520]  they covered up the evidence that vaccines cause autism at much higher rates in black babies
[03:38:31.520 --> 03:38:38.480]  compared to white babies or or non non-black babies there were other races and origins
[03:38:38.480 --> 03:38:45.600]  involved in this study as well i think i think it was 420 increase among african-american infants
[03:38:45.600 --> 03:38:50.160]  but i'd have to double check and make sure that statistic is is correct in any case it's a substantial
[03:38:50.160 --> 03:38:55.520]  increase so now we know that vaccines are targeting black babies we know infant formulas
[03:38:55.520 --> 03:39:04.960]  targeting all babies with aluminum we know that the fluoride is especially toxic to male babies
[03:39:04.960 --> 03:39:10.560]  and then we've got cities like detroit where they deliberately altered the ph of the water
[03:39:10.560 --> 03:39:17.840]  in the public water supply to release a massive amount of aluminum in the water supply that fees
[03:39:18.480 --> 03:39:24.560]  the black community there that provides tap water it had over 100 parts per million of lead
[03:39:24.560 --> 03:39:30.880]  in the tap water at certain times because the city council decided to alter the water source
[03:39:30.880 --> 03:39:39.760]  and change the ph now this my friends this is this is a war on humanity it is a chemical weapons
[03:39:40.400 --> 03:39:48.320]  multi-layered multi-vector warfare system and the warfare system is designed to damage the
[03:39:48.320 --> 03:39:55.680]  neurology of human beings because that is the new enslavement understand why this is so crucial
[03:39:55.680 --> 03:40:02.480]  and share all of this with everybody you know who might find this relevant and interesting
[03:40:02.480 --> 03:40:06.640]  and you can even say hey look there's this white guy scientist talking about how how black babies
[03:40:06.640 --> 03:40:11.680]  are being targeted yeah it's true i did a whole talk on this it's called the science agenda to
[03:40:11.680 --> 03:40:16.640]  exterminate blacks i did a whole lecture on it it's out there on brightion.com i think still if
[03:40:16.640 --> 03:40:26.000]  you want to see it but this is all about destroying the neurology to cause mental IQ damage to the
[03:40:26.000 --> 03:40:33.680]  establishment is trying to make people especially black people incapable of questioning their slavery
[03:40:33.680 --> 03:40:41.120]  this is modern-day neurological slavery this is the scientific plantation to keep you on that
[03:40:41.120 --> 03:40:46.720]  plantation instead of chopping off a foot like they would do to a slave in the old days they
[03:40:46.720 --> 03:40:51.600]  chop off part of your brain with a chemical lobotomy and heavy metals so you can't question
[03:40:51.600 --> 03:40:57.520]  your reality you can never rise up and escape the liberal city traps that they have you trapped in
[03:40:57.520 --> 03:41:02.480]  and tell you to keep voting for democrats who keep you enslaved in the same system of poverty and
[03:41:02.480 --> 03:41:09.040]  destitution and literal chemically induced mental retardation of your children and mass abortion of
[03:41:09.040 --> 03:41:13.920]  your children because you are black this is what's happening in america today and this is run by
[03:41:13.920 --> 03:41:19.520]  democrats this is run by the scientific establishment this is run by the vaccine industry the dental
[03:41:19.520 --> 03:41:26.000]  industry the medical industry the psychiatric drugging of black children this is genocide and
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:30.560]  it is taking place in america today and it has nothing to do with the slavery that was ended
[03:41:30.560 --> 03:41:34.800]  over a hundred years ago this is a whole new modern-day chemical weapons slavery system
[03:41:34.800 --> 03:41:39.680]  and it's in operation right now and it's run by democrats and the scientific establishment
[03:41:40.400 --> 03:41:44.880]  and we we the independent media we've been sounding the alarm on this for decades
[03:41:45.520 --> 03:41:51.520]  alex jones warned you about this i warned you about this natural news we are all warned
[03:41:51.520 --> 03:41:56.960]  about this we've been warning about this for a couple of decades if not more and we were
[03:41:56.960 --> 03:42:03.440]  silenced and we were censored and google gave all the links to the media that said oh there's
[03:42:03.440 --> 03:42:07.600]  no problem with fluoride fluoride doesn't damage anything there's no problem with heavy metals
[03:42:07.600 --> 03:42:11.840]  there's no problem with aluminum there's no problem with vaccines they were all fake news
[03:42:13.040 --> 03:42:21.120]  but we were the ones that got banned because we dared to speak up for the victims of this
[03:42:21.120 --> 03:42:27.600]  massive chemical assault did you realize that if you dump fluoride into the water supply right now
[03:42:27.600 --> 03:42:33.040]  you would be arrested for chemical terrorism and yet every city across america has been doing it
[03:42:33.040 --> 03:42:39.200]  for decades why why are they getting away with that where are the arrests of those city officials
[03:42:39.200 --> 03:42:45.280]  who mass poison their people with fluoride in the water important questions we'll be back with more
[03:42:45.280 --> 03:42:54.880]  here on the alex jones show it's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of

[03:43:52.080 --> 03:43:56.400]  i talk about this on the air and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're gonna
[03:43:56.400 --> 03:44:00.160]  kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before all the
[03:44:00.160 --> 03:44:04.400]  censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the products
[03:44:04.400 --> 03:44:08.160]  are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why
[03:44:08.160 --> 03:44:12.320]  they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll
[03:44:12.320 --> 03:44:15.440]  shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are
[03:44:15.440 --> 03:44:20.400]  and how wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved
[03:44:20.400 --> 03:44:26.800]  supplements he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a
[03:44:26.800 --> 03:44:30.800]  supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then
[03:44:30.800 --> 03:44:35.200]  they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to
[03:44:35.200 --> 03:44:39.040]  tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work
[03:44:39.040 --> 03:44:43.440]  great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[03:44:43.440 --> 03:44:50.080]  god's medicine chest info or store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[03:44:52.480 --> 03:44:59.120]  thomas jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future
[03:44:59.120 --> 03:45:04.080]  it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground close to reality who actually work for a living
[03:45:04.080 --> 03:45:08.880]  that would end up saving the nation and today the communist chinese have banned all u.s farming
[03:45:08.880 --> 03:45:15.040]  goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what he's
[03:45:15.040 --> 03:45:21.120]  doing in this trade war once china put pressure on our farmers that's beautiful americans aren't
[03:45:21.120 --> 03:45:26.480]  going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down so to the walking cruises and the hillary
[03:45:26.480 --> 03:45:30.480]  clinton's the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down we're never
[03:45:30.480 --> 03:45:35.040]  going to give up and all you've done is awaken the human spirit and the human spirit lives
[03:45:35.040 --> 03:45:40.640]  at info wars dot com and news wars dot com and i'm asking listeners whatever you do spread those
[03:45:40.640 --> 03:45:47.120]  links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the resistance we are 1776 worldwide
[03:45:52.960 --> 03:45:57.920]  without your support we won't be here and i couldn't thank you all enough for the fact
[03:45:57.920 --> 03:46:01.280]  that you've kept us in the game i mean i want to stay in this game i want to take the global
[03:46:01.280 --> 03:46:06.240]  list on total transparency is our whole operation if i bring in 35 million dollars half of that's
[03:46:06.240 --> 03:46:10.080]  the cost of the products because we don't mark stuff up that much i don't care if i'm not making
[03:46:10.080 --> 03:46:14.480]  money but you need to buy the products we got coffee we got fish oil we got turmeric we got
[03:46:14.480 --> 03:46:19.120]  great toothpaste we've got great things like dna force plus but ultimate krill oil has been sold
[03:46:19.120 --> 03:46:23.600]  out for four months for whatever reason this became the most popular fish oil it's totally full
[03:46:23.600 --> 03:46:29.280]  of bottle and it is the strongest purest krill oil and it cost us three times more because we
[03:46:29.280 --> 03:46:34.400]  have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury any type of krill oil
[03:46:34.400 --> 03:46:38.720]  you get that doesn't give you fish burps which i don't like but gives you all the great benefits
[03:46:38.720 --> 03:46:42.960]  isn't real it's been boiled it's been ruined it's been homogenized this is not good this
[03:46:42.960 --> 03:46:48.000]  ladies and gentlemen is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere real krill oil
[03:46:48.000 --> 03:46:51.920]  folks is red it's not yellow it's not milky this is nothing but krill oil
[03:46:51.920 --> 03:46:57.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:12.400]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones with mike adams
[03:47:14.480 --> 03:47:19.200]  you know it's always an honor to be here and to be able to bring you this information
[03:47:19.200 --> 03:47:27.280]  and and yeah i get i get angry about the war on humanity i get angry and i express that openly
[03:47:27.280 --> 03:47:34.960]  when i see the mass organized the organized mass murder of of babies and uh entire races
[03:47:35.760 --> 03:47:41.920]  are targeted for extermination right now on our planet and it's all it's in your face now
[03:47:41.920 --> 03:47:46.800]  it's not a hidden agenda it's not a conspiracy theory it's all out in the open i mean you've got
[03:47:46.800 --> 03:47:52.800]  now the mainstream saying water filters are bad that you're supposed to drink maximum poison how
[03:47:52.800 --> 03:47:59.040]  dare you filter your water and have clean water and protect your brain from fluoride or arsenic
[03:47:59.040 --> 03:48:03.760]  or toxic heavy metals or pesticides that might be in your water how dare you filter that you're
[03:48:03.760 --> 03:48:08.160]  supposed to drink the poisons that they have prescribed for you that's out in the open now
[03:48:09.200 --> 03:48:15.840]  water filters are bad they say carbon dioxide is bad i mean carbon dioxide is bad it's the
[03:48:15.840 --> 03:48:21.280]  number one most important nutrient for every plant on earth that grows the food that grows the herbs
[03:48:21.840 --> 03:48:27.360]  all the seeds all the fruits and vegetables everything grown because of carbon dioxide
[03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:34.720]  photosynthesis chlorophyll i mean go back to you know science 101 in high school chlorophyll
[03:48:35.280 --> 03:48:40.960]  photosynthesis this is how plants live carbon dioxide but the insane delusional anti-human left
[03:48:40.960 --> 03:48:46.640]  says carbon dioxide's bad and they have to get rid of carbon dioxide uh they say organics are all
[03:48:46.640 --> 03:48:52.480]  bad they say nutrition is bad google's now banning natural health websites google's banning information
[03:48:52.480 --> 03:48:59.040]  that promotes organics if you speak out against gmo's against vaccines against pesticides against
[03:48:59.040 --> 03:49:06.080]  heavy metals you are now censored because google wants you to be poisoned because google is so evil
[03:49:06.080 --> 03:49:12.320]  it is part of this massive chemical assault multi-layered multi-vectored system to destroy
[03:49:12.320 --> 03:49:16.720]  humanity and in order to do that they have to destroy information first and they have to destroy
[03:49:16.720 --> 03:49:22.240]  free speech but just understand this is all out in the open now you are supposed to eat your poison
[03:49:22.240 --> 03:49:28.880]  and you're supposed to like it and you're supposed to worship your slave masters that's that's the
[03:49:28.880 --> 03:49:34.560]  message from the system how dare you try to have clean food and clean water and i tell you it's it's
[03:49:34.560 --> 03:49:43.120]  so insane i'm even going to quote here from none other than pierce morgan yes pierce morgan former
[03:49:43.120 --> 03:49:49.440]  cnn host pierce morgan even though he's a crazy gun control nut he's starting to get it about how
[03:49:49.440 --> 03:49:56.320]  insane liberals are and there's a video of him out there today he says populism is rising because
[03:49:56.320 --> 03:50:02.160]  liberals have become unbearable this is pierce morgan again the same pierce morgan that interviewed
[03:50:02.160 --> 03:50:09.040]  alex jones a few years ago and what you know was condemning jones pierce morgan says i speak as a
[03:50:09.040 --> 03:50:15.520]  liberal liberals have become utterly pathetically ill-liberal and it's a massive problem what's
[03:50:15.520 --> 03:50:19.280]  the point of calling yourself a liberal if you don't allow anyone else to have a different view
[03:50:19.280 --> 03:50:25.440]  this snowflake culture we operate in this victimhood culture that everyone has to think a certain way
[03:50:25.440 --> 03:50:29.840]  everyone has to have a bleeding heart you say a joke 10 years ago that offended somebody you
[03:50:29.840 --> 03:50:35.120]  could never host the austers you know he goes on he says people are fed up with the snowflake
[03:50:35.120 --> 03:50:39.360]  libtard culture basically this is what pierce morgan is saying now hey guess what pierce morgan
[03:50:39.360 --> 03:50:47.280]  is starting to get it it's insane the insanity has become the face of the democrat party and the
[03:50:47.280 --> 03:50:52.160]  face of everything that the left does and this is why more and more people who he didn't even
[03:50:52.160 --> 03:50:57.040]  vote for trump in 2016 are now coming out in support of trump people are seeing what's happening to
[03:50:57.040 --> 03:51:03.200]  the democrats they're like these people are insane and this has implications on economics and the
[03:51:03.200 --> 03:51:08.160]  stock market too i wanted to this is going to blow you away you've probably heard of this
[03:51:08.160 --> 03:51:14.000]  company called we work right we work is about to go public and they they've issued some kind of
[03:51:14.640 --> 03:51:22.560]  you know report before going public that's being characterized as a quote masterpiece of obfuscation
[03:51:22.560 --> 03:51:29.200]  now we work is a this is one of these virtue signaling liberal left-wing ipos and there are
[03:51:29.200 --> 03:51:33.520]  a bunch of these now where they really don't have much of a business model they don't do anything
[03:51:33.520 --> 03:51:39.040]  special they really don't offer much to the world i mean we work just basically rents office space to
[03:51:39.040 --> 03:51:43.440]  people but then they claim we're going to raise consciousness and we're going to we're going
[03:51:43.440 --> 03:51:48.720]  to have consciousness capital and we're going to change the world with this consciousness and our
[03:51:48.720 --> 03:51:53.760]  unique technology which doesn't even exist there's nothing unique about a database and a spreadsheet
[03:51:53.760 --> 03:51:58.720]  by the way that's not unique i mean an online reservation system really airlines had that in
[03:51:58.720 --> 03:52:04.800]  the 1980s that's not new by the way it's not new at all but these young millennials are
[03:52:04.800 --> 03:52:11.200]  investing in companies like we work or or uber or you know other similar companies even tesla
[03:52:11.200 --> 03:52:16.960]  because of the narrative oh it's all virtue signaling oh we're going to save the planet
[03:52:16.960 --> 03:52:20.640]  we're going to change the world we're going to raise consciousness we're going to have
[03:52:20.640 --> 03:52:28.080]  consciousness capital or sometimes they call it a conscious capitalism but it's all bs because
[03:52:28.080 --> 03:52:32.640]  most of these companies don't make money they all lose money i mean almost all of them lose money
[03:52:32.640 --> 03:52:38.160]  all the time this is burning through investor money they don't offer anything really unique
[03:52:38.160 --> 03:52:42.080]  to the world now by the way i'm not shorting any of these companies i'm not saying this out of my
[03:52:42.080 --> 03:52:47.680]  own self-interest i don't i'm not even in the stock market i buy gold okay i buy physical gold
[03:52:48.400 --> 03:52:53.920]  that's what i do and ammunition things like that i'm not in the market so you know get your own
[03:52:53.920 --> 03:52:59.920]  financial advice but the point is the liberal millennial investors have never seen a stock
[03:52:59.920 --> 03:53:04.640]  market crash because they're too young and they're throwing all this money into these companies
[03:53:04.640 --> 03:53:11.520]  because they want a virtue signal oh we invested and we work we bought some tesla stock we bought some
[03:53:11.520 --> 03:53:18.560]  uber stock and they want to feel good well guess what these companies i believe in my assessment
[03:53:18.560 --> 03:53:25.600]  are going to catastrophically crash one day worse than the original dot com crash of 2000 2001
[03:53:25.600 --> 03:53:29.120]  it's going to be catastrophic a lot of these companies will lose 99 percent of their value
[03:53:29.120 --> 03:53:34.480]  like dr coop did back in the first dot com crash which i also warned about by the way in 1998 and
[03:53:34.480 --> 03:53:39.840]  1999 and these liberals for the first time they're going to see all their savings wiped out and
[03:53:39.840 --> 03:53:44.080]  they're going to start to wonder well wait a minute i thought that we did all the right things for
[03:53:44.080 --> 03:53:48.960]  virtue i thought this was ethical i thought we were saving the planet no you're investing in a
[03:53:48.960 --> 03:53:54.480]  lunatic left-wing scheme that doesn't make money and just burns cash and you know the amazing thing
[03:53:54.480 --> 03:54:01.840]  about the free market is that if there are public investors who want to put money into bad ideas
[03:54:01.840 --> 03:54:07.680]  the market will create companies based on bad ideas that will gladly consume their money and
[03:54:07.680 --> 03:54:13.520]  that's exactly what's happening it's a lesson in basic economics leftists create demand for bad
[03:54:13.520 --> 03:54:17.760]  ideas and so what do you know they're all these companies that are based on bad ideas that are
[03:54:17.760 --> 03:54:23.360]  going to gladly take that liberal money and burn it and just obliterate it and one day and it's
[03:54:23.360 --> 03:54:28.960]  coming one day all these liberals are going to say we're at all all the money go uh guess what it
[03:54:28.960 --> 03:54:33.600]  went into a black hole of virtue signaling that's where it went and by the way don't forget about
[03:54:33.600 --> 03:54:39.600]  Theranos so Theranos was another company led by Elizabeth Holmes who's now facing criminal charges
[03:54:39.600 --> 03:54:43.920]  Theranos they claimed they were going to change the world with a drop of blood from your finger
[03:54:43.920 --> 03:54:48.960]  they were going to miniaturize 250 analytical blood tests and they were going to have blood
[03:54:48.960 --> 03:54:53.280]  tests of everybody in your home a little device that you just put your finger in it and it it
[03:54:53.280 --> 03:54:57.440]  takes a little drop of blood and you can you can uh you know tell what's going on with your heart
[03:54:57.440 --> 03:55:02.240]  and your and diabetes and all these biomarkers it's going to change the world except the whole
[03:55:02.240 --> 03:55:10.800]  thing was a fraud she made it all up 900 million dollars blown away billions of dollars in valuation
[03:55:10.800 --> 03:55:16.400]  gone the company was actually disbanded last year and then criminally charged i think by the doj
[03:55:17.760 --> 03:55:22.800]  but it had a great story all along and a lot of people invested in it oh it's good she's
[03:55:22.800 --> 03:55:27.200]  going to change the world that she's a an entrepreneurial woman she's a leader of our
[03:55:27.200 --> 03:55:33.440]  community and she has heart she's got feelings that's what people are investing in and they're
[03:55:33.440 --> 03:55:40.240]  going to lose every time and they did lose every time when it came to Theranos so my word of caution
[03:55:40.240 --> 03:55:47.520]  in this is when you invest in something are you buy stocks or anything make sure it makes sense
[03:55:47.520 --> 03:55:53.040]  be rational about it don't don't virtue signal with your investments and a lot of these corporations
[03:55:53.040 --> 03:55:56.080]  now that they're publicly saying that all they're going to do now is virtue signal they're going to
[03:55:56.080 --> 03:56:00.080]  push transgenderism and they're going to push gun control and they don't even care about profits
[03:56:00.080 --> 03:56:06.560]  anymore guess what eventually all those companies will go bankrupt because they've stopped functioning
[03:56:06.560 --> 03:56:12.160]  as a rational business they've violated the laws of economics according to analysts by the way
[03:56:12.160 --> 03:56:16.160]  and i haven't looked at this personally but some analysts say general electric is massively
[03:56:16.160 --> 03:56:22.800]  overstating its earnings some analysts say disney is in trouble some analysts say of course tesla
[03:56:22.800 --> 03:56:29.680]  is in big trouble not only do their cars spontaneously explode into balls of flame maybe the company
[03:56:29.680 --> 03:56:34.160]  might do that one day who knows i mean it's so crazy i i get i get the feeling if elan must
[03:56:34.160 --> 03:56:41.440]  bumps his head on a stairwell he might spontaneously burst into flame who knows a jp morgan may be in
[03:56:41.440 --> 03:56:46.880]  so much trouble they actually own the ship that was busted carrying a billion dollars worth of
[03:56:46.880 --> 03:56:55.040]  cocaine busted in the port of philadelphia jp morgan owned the ship and you say banks and money
[03:56:55.040 --> 03:57:01.280]  laundering and drug trafficking yeah uh look at the history of hsbc look at the history of jp morgan
[03:57:01.280 --> 03:57:05.520]  and you'll come to understand maybe what's really powering the financial system right now
[03:57:05.520 --> 03:57:12.880]  because it's not rationality a lot of it is just fraud corruption and you know fake promotions of
[03:57:12.880 --> 03:57:18.880]  things that won't work long term so be cautious people make your own decisions get informed but
[03:57:18.880 --> 03:57:23.680]  be cautious and keep tuning in to info wars dot com where you'll get the real story on economics
