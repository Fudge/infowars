[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:18.000 --> 00:46.000]  Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us. It's hard to believe. It really is incredible that it seems like it was just a few days ago,
[00:46.000 --> 00:55.000]  at least in my mind, that we saw the tragic attacks of September 11th that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York,
[00:55.000 --> 01:05.000]  most of the Americans, but a large cross-section of the rest of the planet being the center of cosmopolitan America.
[01:05.000 --> 01:22.000]  I knew the terror attack was coming. I saw the hype, I saw the preparation in the media, but I also was sent the law enforcement publications where they were pre-brainwashing the police and military,
[01:22.000 --> 01:38.000]  and I saw them roll out bin Laden as the boogeyman. I knew his codename in the CIA was Tim Osmond. I knew his family built most of the major US military bases in the Middle East and the British military bases going back more than 80 years.
[01:38.000 --> 01:52.000]  And I understood that most of the Muslim terrorist leaders are banker financed. That doesn't mean that they don't have jihadis under them who actually hate America and hate the West.
[01:52.000 --> 02:15.000]  It's a very complex situation, and if you haven't studied spycraft, if you haven't studied cloak and dagger, if you haven't studied patsies and decoys, then to hear someone say that a horrible event like 9-11 is an inside job is very upsetting.
[02:15.000 --> 02:38.000]  It's very upsetting for me to say it. I don't enjoy it. It makes me sick to my stomach. I have nightmares about it, but what makes me sicker is knowing that it was an inside job and that I am fully aware of the people that carried out the events and who they are,
[02:38.000 --> 02:47.000]  and that they're going to carry out more events if I don't expose them. And so that's why I bite the bullet.
[02:47.000 --> 02:58.000]  And I made a lot of sacrifices to tell the truth. I was in a radio shack today getting an emergency radio because my old one broke.
[02:58.000 --> 03:16.000]  A weather radio, a gentleman walked up to me and he said, seemed like a friendly person, had a lot of intelligence in his eyes, and he said, I really appreciate your work, Alex, but why are you still alive?
[03:16.000 --> 03:23.000]  And I know you're asking that question. Don't you think I ask it?
[03:23.000 --> 03:32.000]  And I said, look, they don't want to highlight everything I've said. They don't want to underline it. They don't want to add 100 exclamation points to the end of it. They don't want to make me a martyr.
[03:32.000 --> 03:39.000]  They try to just assassinate my character as Cass Sutton-Steen at the White House says they do.
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.000]  But I didn't say the biggest reason as I left the store. And that's God.
[03:46.000 --> 03:55.000]  The globalists are not all powerful. There is a higher power. We can all feel it. We know it. We see it.
[03:55.000 --> 04:02.000]  The universe bends towards justice. I think it was Martin Luther King said that.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  Gandhi said the seed of the universe is within each and every one of us.
[04:07.000 --> 04:26.000]  The truth will set you free. And I cannot live in a world. I cannot give in to fear and live in a world in fear where terrorists stage events like 9-11, synthetic manufactured events.
[04:26.000 --> 04:37.000]  I just can't go along with it and be delusional and say, well, that's scary and that's horrible and it's just too incredible to look at.
[04:37.000 --> 04:50.000]  So I'll lie to myself and make excuses to myself and just say, oh no, it's not an inside job and buy into the fable. You can't do that.
[04:50.000 --> 04:57.000]  The 9-11 lives have been used to kill over a million people in the Middle East and to destroy our liberties here. And it's only getting worse.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[05:08.000 --> 05:14.000]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true.
[05:14.000 --> 05:23.000]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[05:27.000 --> 05:34.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[05:39.000 --> 05:44.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[05:44.000 --> 05:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[05:50.000 --> 06:10.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[06:20.000 --> 06:28.000]  Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[06:28.000 --> 06:33.000]  Ten years after the tragic attacks of 9-11.
[06:33.000 --> 06:44.000]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours on this special September 11th, 2011 global transmission.
[06:44.000 --> 06:56.000]  Hard to believe that it is 9-11-11.
[06:56.000 --> 07:09.000]  Ten years later, now I am going to review today just a very small smidgen
[07:09.000 --> 07:15.000]  of some of the glaring holes in the official narrative.
[07:15.000 --> 07:19.000]  And then I'm going to open the phones up and take your calls.
[07:19.000 --> 07:25.000]  What is your view of what 9-11 has done to America and the rest of the world, and where we go from here?
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  Do you have evidence that it's an inside job? Obviously, there is evidence.
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  What do you think the most important smoking guns are?
[07:34.000 --> 07:45.000]  Or if you disagree with me, if you think the official story is true, don't be intimidated, call me.
[07:45.000 --> 07:50.000]  And I'm not here lobbying for phone calls. We can get hundreds of phone calls.
[07:50.000 --> 07:57.000]  We can open up our digital phone system here and get 100 phone calls in within 30 seconds.
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.000]  The phone system is not open yet, but we're opening it in one minute.
[08:01.000 --> 08:10.000]  I want to hear from you. 877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539.
[08:10.000 --> 08:13.000]  So if you want to call and disagree, you better dial right now.
[08:13.000 --> 08:21.000]  Agree, disagree, have points. I want to hear from you. 877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539.
[08:21.000 --> 08:28.000]  Now, if you're a new listener, I want to just get something completely straight here.
[08:28.000 --> 08:39.000]  When I say an inside job, when I say a false flag, when I say a self-inflicted wound,
[08:39.000 --> 08:46.000]  I am stating that if you look at the evidence, it's clear,
[08:46.000 --> 08:53.000]  incontrovertible, that the official story is a hoax and is a lie.
[08:53.000 --> 09:01.000]  I believe from the evidence we've got that we have a pretty clear image of how the attacks were carried out.
[09:01.000 --> 09:07.000]  But I tend to not even go there because that is not 100% provable.
[09:07.000 --> 09:15.000]  What is 100% provable is that the official story from end to end, up one side and down the other,
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  is a complete and total ridiculous fabrication.
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.000]  There are over 300 smoking guns that prove 9-11's an inside job.
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  We have those posted at infowars.com.
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.000]  In fact, I'm going to call one of the webmasters and have them put it back on the front page,
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  or one of the writers, because I know we reposted that last week,
[09:34.000 --> 09:41.000]  but I want it on the front page of infowars.com and prisonpana.com, and I'll get that posted there.
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.000]  There's a lot of videos, a lot of evidence there.
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  We're going to be going over some of that today, but also taking your phone calls.
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.000]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I have a little five-minute news report
[09:55.000 --> 10:00.000]  that we, of course, aired Friday night on InfoWars Nightly News,
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.000]  Monday through Friday, 7 p.m. Central, 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 Pacific, 6 Mountain,
[10:07.000 --> 10:15.000]  that streams live and then is archived at prisonpana.tv and InfoWars Nightly News, infowarsnews.com.
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.000]  And yes, I already have cable systems and different satellite systems that do want to pick it up,
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  but we're still refining the show and doing some beta testing.
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  That's why some nights it's an hour long, some nights two hours.
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  In the future, it will be set to 30 minutes, but we're just gauging and tracking
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  and really just seeing what I, what different formats I like.
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  So we're doing a public beta test at prisonplanet.tv.
[10:40.000 --> 10:47.000]  There'll be expanded special reports there, but on Friday,
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  we went out and talked to 15 people on the streets of Austin,
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.000]  because the guys have got to go out, do their man on the street, turn around, come right back.
[10:55.000 --> 11:02.000]  We interviewed 15 and one person out of the 15 did not think that Building 7
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  was a controlled demolition or looked suspicious.
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  One person out of 15.
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  So I thought, I think I'll do a special report, which of course is longer than the 30 minute
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  nightly news in the next few weeks, or I'm going to go down to the University of Texas
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  and then to the Capitol and then maybe Sixth Street, three different crowds
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  and run a camera in a crowd for 30 minutes with an open mic
[11:27.000 --> 11:34.000]  and just ask people their opinions of 9-11 to give you a snapshot kind of focus group on the street.
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.000]  Now there was an Angus and Reed poll five years ago,
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  and we cover this in my film Terror Storm.
[11:39.000 --> 11:42.000]  You can just type it in, Angus and Reed, New York Times poll.
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  83% do not believe official story, believe government may be involved.
[11:46.000 --> 11:52.000]  So you see a lot of push polls and polls where they're calling
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  or surveying people they've already surveyed before,
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.000]  and they have psychological algorithm actuaries that they know the answer they're going to get,
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  and you hear 10 to 15% think it's an inside job.
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  Other polls, 36%, other scientific polls.
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  Most polls are in the mid-60s, and that's what I found myself on the street.
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  About 65% of people don't buy the official story.
[12:15.000 --> 12:23.000]  So they run this hoax that it's 10-15%, and the establishment's running a new hoax right now
[12:23.000 --> 12:31.000]  that, oh, 9-11 truth is dead, and I knew this was a talking point for the September 11 TV shows
[12:31.000 --> 12:44.000]  when MSNBC called, I don't know, New York Times, Slate, BBC,
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  and after two or three, I mean, I could tell what was on the plate,
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.000]  what the talking point was, going back three months ago,
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.000]  as they were getting all these shows ready, and it was, well, how do you feel now being discredited
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.000]  and the fact that no one believes 9-11 was an inside job?
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  And then they would never present any facts.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  I could just see that that was the talking point.
[13:07.000 --> 13:15.000]  So when new media would call up you after that, I would say, let me guess first,
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.000]  how do I feel about 9-11 truth declining and being dead?
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  And the Slate guy was, well, yeah, actually, that is my question.
[13:22.000 --> 13:29.000]  And I was like, so the editor called you up and said, this is the piece.
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  So, I mean, don't you understand this is a talking point?
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  Isn't that evidence right there?
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  But see, these are hired mercenaries.
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.000]  They just write what they're told the angle is.
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.000]  All the facts on the phone with this guy for, I don't know, an hour and a half, two hours meant nothing.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  None of it went in this five-part series they did.
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.000]  It was all just regurgitating the same playbook.
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  See, I saw the playbook before 9-11.
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  I went on air really six months before, a year before, but by two months before,
[14:08.000 --> 14:14.000]  I was able to specifically say they're going to blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset.
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  Some have been live.
[14:19.000 --> 14:25.000]  And then I went on air the day of the event and pointed out they blown up Building 7.
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  I had a nighttime radio show at the time as well.
[14:29.000 --> 14:33.000]  I told people, I said, I heard on the radio on national news.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  It was at CBS and ABC.
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.000]  I heard both.
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  I saw it on TV.
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  They said they're going to have a control demolition of Building 7.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  I didn't have a big officer or a big staff.
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  I had one person working with me.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.000]  It was my girlfriend and one employee and myself at that time.
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.000]  Doing the fulfillment, making the films, doing the radio show, everything.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  Ten years ago.
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  I guess I had one other, I had a secretary too, so I had two employees and then my girlfriend.
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  So it was four of us then.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  So I remember seeing it.
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  People would attack me and say, you didn't see them say they were going to blow up Building 7.
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.000]  You didn't hear that.
[15:13.000 --> 15:20.000]  And then years later, when the internet became so prolific, all these downloads and people at news stations released all that.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  And there's got to be more than 10 different newscasts.
[15:23.000 --> 15:24.000]  We've aired them here.
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  I've put them in films where there's cops saying, get back.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  They say they're going to blow up Building 7.
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  And the news saying they're going to blow it up.
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  After they blew it up, you know, that big 47-story building, they told everybody, no, we didn't say we were going to blow it up.
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.000]  You know, those are the type of smoking guns.
[15:42.000 --> 15:49.000]  But I want to, I want to get into something even more important when we come back.
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.000]  How 9-Eleven has been used to kill our Republic.
[15:54.000 --> 16:00.000]  I mean, there's no doubt the government's used it to destroy our liberties and freedoms.
[16:00.000 --> 16:07.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[16:07.000 --> 16:12.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[16:12.000 --> 16:21.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[16:21.000 --> 16:29.000]  They sell pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[16:29.000 --> 16:34.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[16:34.000 --> 16:39.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans.
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.000]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection,
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  so you can ride all day with confidence.
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[16:55.000 --> 16:59.000]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  You may be arrested and no subject to other police action.
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.000]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[17:11.000 --> 17:17.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[17:17.000 --> 17:24.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cams, now being expanded nationwide.
[17:24.000 --> 17:30.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[17:30.000 --> 17:34.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[17:38.000 --> 17:44.000]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[17:48.000 --> 17:51.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.
[17:51.000 --> 17:58.000]  Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrismPlanet.TV.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[18:27.000 --> 18:31.000]  The huge issue of the Great Depression is on everyone's mind.
[18:31.000 --> 18:37.000]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.
[18:37.000 --> 18:59.000]  So everyone needs food security.
[18:59.000 --> 19:07.000]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[19:07.000 --> 19:10.000]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.000]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.000]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  The crazy part is he's usually right.
[19:20.000 --> 19:27.000]  You see he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[19:30.000 --> 19:36.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[19:38.000 --> 19:39.000]  I can't stress this enough.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.000]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[19:46.000 --> 19:51.000]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[19:51.000 --> 19:57.000]  That's End of America, the number 3.com. Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  That's End of America 3.com.
[20:01.000 --> 20:04.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[20:04.000 --> 20:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:09.000 --> 20:18.000]  Music
[20:18.000 --> 20:22.000]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[20:22.000 --> 20:27.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  Okay.
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  I want to try to break something down here.
[20:34.000 --> 20:37.000]  Music
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  I love America.
[20:39.000 --> 20:40.000]  I love our republic.
[20:40.000 --> 20:48.000]  I think that we've been the greatest and the freest country in history.
[20:48.000 --> 20:54.000]  Our system hasn't been perfect, but it's been heads and shoulders above all others.
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  The inventiveness, the rugged individualism, all of it.
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  It is the example of the world.
[21:00.000 --> 21:05.000]  And because we had liberty, great wealth came to this country.
[21:05.000 --> 21:13.000]  And our nation fought other tyrannies and was a leader in standing up against evil.
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  And so we became the good guys of the world.
[21:18.000 --> 21:28.000]  But that allowed powerful offshore corporate interest to come in to set up the CIA in 1947 to be given total secrecy.
[21:28.000 --> 21:36.000]  And to basically take over the government from within, Kennedy tried to reverse it and they murdered him.
[21:36.000 --> 21:48.000]  But still they call it a conspiracy theory after they've now released the Jackie tapes with the famous historian that recorded her right after saying the government killed Kennedy and she knew the details.
[21:48.000 --> 21:53.000]  We have the lawyers to the vice president coming out and saying it.
[21:53.000 --> 21:59.000]  We have the mistress of the vice president who became president.
[21:59.000 --> 22:09.000]  We have the head hit man, E Howard Hunt, who ran hitman operations for the CIA, killing world leaders worldwide on his deathbed, audio and video.
[22:09.000 --> 22:13.000]  We've aired it here, premiered it here.
[22:13.000 --> 22:19.000]  Coast to coast premiered some of it and we've premiered the rest of it.
[22:19.000 --> 22:23.000]  On and on and on, 92% of Americans now believe the government killed Kennedy.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  But that's not really accurate.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  Criminal rogue elements.
[22:27.000 --> 22:35.000]  If somebody hijacks a milk truck and uses it as a weapon, it isn't the milk company that did it.
[22:35.000 --> 22:47.000]  Just because a hijacker is wearing a 707 or 747 uniform doesn't mean they're really the real pilot.
[22:47.000 --> 22:57.000]  It's this co-opting, the criminal elements that run this government orchestrated 9-11.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  We know the official stories align.
[23:00.000 --> 23:08.000]  Now, does that mean that there aren't terrorists, people that are resisting Western forces in the world?
[23:08.000 --> 23:09.000]  No, there are.
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.000]  There are real people that bomb things and shoot people.
[23:12.000 --> 23:18.000]  It happened today in Afghanistan, 77 US troops wounded in attack on Afghan base.
[23:18.000 --> 23:25.000]  And it's funny, the Taliban in their statement said we take credit for this but not the September 11 attacks
[23:25.000 --> 23:31.000]  and basically went on to say that was the work of the New World Order.
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  Isn't that interesting?
[23:33.000 --> 23:38.000]  You know, the Taliban at the time said there's different groups of Taliban.
[23:38.000 --> 23:44.000]  It's like saying Christians took credit or, you know, Alabamans took credit.
[23:44.000 --> 23:48.000]  Everybody in Afghanistan was Taliban basically.
[23:48.000 --> 23:54.000]  And there were different camps and they said show us the proof we will give you some of bin Laden.
[23:54.000 --> 23:58.000]  And then a tape was put out with bin Laden saying he hadn't done it.
[23:58.000 --> 24:02.000]  But then other tapes were put out which had been voice scanned and voice printed by major universities
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  and are known to some of bin Laden.
[24:04.000 --> 24:12.000]  I mean when a government will lie to you over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[24:12.000 --> 24:13.000]  and over and over and over and over.
[24:13.000 --> 24:17.000]  And stage the Gulf of Tonkin to get us into Vietnam attacks on our ships.
[24:17.000 --> 24:24.000]  It's declassified that our government with NATO carried out hundreds of bombings in Europe under Operation Gladio.
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  I mean, go pull up its mainline history.
[24:28.000 --> 24:35.000]  I'm talking about blowing up school buses because their favorite target is to kill kids to then blame their enemy with it.
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  It's called waving the bloody shirt.
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.000]  WikiLeaks, three years ago.
[24:41.000 --> 24:46.000]  You can just type in WikiLeaks, army filled manual, false flag.
[24:46.000 --> 24:56.000]  It'll come up and the government said, yeah, that's a real manual and we're going to charge with espionage whoever released this.
[24:56.000 --> 25:04.000]  The Pentagon didn't come out and say, no, we don't teach army captains and above who are in special operations groups out of stage terror.
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  They said, we're going to find out who released that and they're going to prison.
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.000]  Listen, I've had a lot of family who are army officers and others.
[25:12.000 --> 25:19.000]  If I go to a family reunion, there are so many people that have served in intelligence can make your head spin.
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.000]  And they'll all tell you the government is as crooked as a dog's hind leg.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  They run the narcotics.
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.000]  They run the murder operations.
[25:27.000 --> 25:28.000]  They run it all.
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.000]  That's criminal, very small elements.
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  They are illegitimate.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  Now, does that mean there aren't Muslim extremists?
[25:36.000 --> 25:37.000]  Absolutely not.
[25:37.000 --> 25:43.000]  There are extremists of every group out there.
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.000]  But I want to be clear here with this.
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.000]  This is a big deal.
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  I've talked about it all week on Monday or actually Tuesday morning in Town Hall, World Net Daily and over 100 newspapers nationwide.
[25:53.000 --> 25:58.000]  Over 100 carry Chuck Norris' column.
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  Chuck Norris came out.
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  What was the headline?
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  Pull it up, Jeremy.
[26:04.000 --> 26:05.000]  I forgot the exact headline.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  Ten years after 9-11, our government is enabling terrorist.
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.000]  And the first party says Alex Jones has put out reports to tailing this and he links to it.
[26:15.000 --> 26:22.000]  And he gets into Amaralalaki hanging out at the Pentagon and Amaralalaki's records being protected by the State Department for his, quote, privacy.
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  And he gets into why is our government funding Taliban and al-Qaeda?
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  Why is the government giving al-Qaeda Libya?
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  I mean, in charge now is a known al-Qaeda.
[26:31.000 --> 26:32.000]  There it is.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  Chuck Norris fed still-enabled terrorists.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  Penders that were 9-11 Town Hall.
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  Now, Chuck's been on the show many times.
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.000]  He says he's been less than 16 years since I got on the air.
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.000]  But still, off air, he'd say, Alex, I know you think these things, but I just can't believe it.
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  I'm going to try to get ahold of Chuck.
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  Chuck's basically come out and said something's going on here.
[26:55.000 --> 27:12.000]  Look, when the number three in al-Qaeda is hanging out secretly at the Pentagon, two weeks after 9-11, and then Alaki's running the Fort Hood Shooter, the Christmas Day Underwear Bomber, the Times Square Bomber, the Shoe Bomber,
[27:12.000 --> 27:24.000]  a swat it came out in the London Telegraph and Fox News admittedly, who ran the 7-7 bombings, is MI6, that's British CIA, and is protected and did command the attacks.
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  And it comes out, nobody gets in trouble.
[27:27.000 --> 27:36.000]  They have got master criminals, and they've got a perfect pool of basically naturally mind-controlled people.
[27:36.000 --> 27:46.000]  They can go to these poor villages of people oppressed who have no future, can't even get enough food to eat, and they say, I will pay your family $100,000, go do this.
[27:46.000 --> 27:56.000]  But the guy commanding them, it isn't double agents or triple agents, or because I've talked to high-level FBI agents on and off air, retired and current.
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  And they go, I know, Alex, it's like they've got moles everywhere in government.
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  No, no, you got it backwards.
[28:01.000 --> 28:07.000]  The corporate criminals have moles at the top, they run it.
[28:07.000 --> 28:16.000]  So what you've got to understand is, in even most of these suicide attacks, the money leads right back to Western intelligence.
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  If you don't believe me, please take notes.
[28:18.000 --> 28:26.000]  Type in Israel created Hamash, 1973.
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  You'll get a rich, Jerusalem Post, UPI.
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  This is not me.
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  And then read why they created it.
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.000]  You see, the military industrial complex is the same everywhere.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  It wants war, it wants more power.
[28:43.000 --> 28:52.000]  And it will go out and create an enemy so they didn't get the trillions a year and take over society and set up checkpoints all over the country and overthrow the Bill of Rights.
[28:52.000 --> 28:56.000]  They didn't get taxpayer money to fund all of it.
[28:56.000 --> 29:01.000]  What did Rumsfeld say? I'll tell you when we come back.
[29:01.000 --> 29:06.000]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming.
[29:09.000 --> 29:13.000]  And I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.000]  Number one, study the past.
[29:15.000 --> 29:17.000]  History really does repeat itself.
[29:17.000 --> 29:22.000]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[29:22.000 --> 29:25.000]  Number three, take decisive action.
[29:25.000 --> 29:29.000]  A perfect storm is brewing for a global food crisis.
[29:29.000 --> 29:34.000]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves.
[29:34.000 --> 29:38.000]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[29:38.000 --> 29:41.000]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[29:41.000 --> 29:46.000]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[29:46.000 --> 29:51.000]  You'll also get a free copy of supermarket survival, how to cut your grocery bills in half.
[29:51.000 --> 29:56.000]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[29:56.000 --> 29:59.000]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[30:01.000 --> 30:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[30:08.000 --> 30:14.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[30:14.000 --> 30:20.000]  There's been tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[30:20.000 --> 30:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[30:25.000 --> 30:28.000]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[30:28.000 --> 30:35.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[30:35.000 --> 30:39.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches.
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[30:41.000 --> 30:48.000]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[30:48.000 --> 30:53.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[30:53.000 --> 31:12.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[31:23.000 --> 31:30.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[31:53.000 --> 31:56.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com
[32:23.000 --> 32:30.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[32:53.000 --> 33:00.000]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's endofamerica3.com.
[33:23.000 --> 33:36.000]  Okay, John, Danielle, John, Debbie, Jane, Angie, Nichols, Nicholas, Joe, Robert, Kevin, Karen, Howard, I'll get to all of you.
[33:36.000 --> 33:41.000]  I want to play our man on the street building seven piece here in a moment.
[33:41.000 --> 33:49.000]  But to illustrate the point of what I'm covering, human events on Friday did an interview with Donald Rumsfeld.
[33:49.000 --> 33:59.000]  And in case you're doubting their headline, you can go listen to the interview below where the reporter talks to him.
[33:59.000 --> 34:06.000]  And Rumsfeld, here's the headline, attack imminent if Congress cuts defense.
[34:06.000 --> 34:15.000]  And he said, if any cuts are made, there will be another attack.
[34:15.000 --> 34:21.000]  If we make this mistake, we're doomed to suffer another attack of some kind and our intelligence will be less strong and less effective.
[34:21.000 --> 34:26.000]  It's very simple. You know, the Soviet Union is gone. They need a new threat.
[34:26.000 --> 34:33.000]  And this is a full spectrum threat that can never be defeated, is shadowy, and you can frame anybody you want.
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  You can get rid of the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[34:35.000 --> 34:43.000]  As you know that in every major city in the United States, they ran huge checkpoints and randomly searched people's cars.
[34:43.000 --> 34:51.000]  D.C., New York, Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, but the borders are basically wide open.
[34:51.000 --> 34:58.000]  And the underwear bomber, and I told you this a month and a half before the State Department admitted it.
[34:58.000 --> 35:05.000]  That's how good our intelligence is here, that the U.S. government got the underwear bomber on.
[35:05.000 --> 35:17.000]  He was so drugged, he couldn't talk when the witnesses we had on, who were on the flight with him, said, the sharp-dressed man without a passport, without anything, got him on the plane.
[35:17.000 --> 35:21.000]  People at the gate were like, well, no. And the person's like, basically national security.
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  And they were like, okay, let me say that again.
[35:26.000 --> 35:32.000]  Kurt Haskell and his wife, and now we learn others, witnessed him gotten on the plane.
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.000]  They witnessed the firecracker, all of it.
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  And the FBI came and tried to get him to change the story, basically.
[35:40.000 --> 35:46.000]  They wouldn't. And then the State Department got freaked out and said, the undersecretary said, yeah, we were ordered to get him on the plane.
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  We were ordered to give him a visa, and he didn't have a passport.
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.000]  Yes, we were ordered by an unnamed U.S. intelligence agency.
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.000]  And then they always spin it. Oh, well, I'm sure they were tracking him and wanted to know who he was going to meet with.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.000]  Bull, bull, bull.
[36:01.000 --> 36:12.000]  The guy that ran all these people, the cut out name they think they're talking to is Anwar al-Alaqi.
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  Every time they're run by a government agent.
[36:16.000 --> 36:25.000]  Did you hear me earlier? You can type in Israel-founded Hamas, or type in Israel-created fake al-Qaeda and staged bombings.
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.000]  And you will get the Israeli newspapers, not me.
[36:28.000 --> 36:34.000]  This is in the Israeli news. The Israelis get angry. The population does about this.
[36:34.000 --> 36:41.000]  Every time there's about to be a peace deal or something, they either let a grip do what they're planning, or they actually go out and do it themselves.
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.000]  This is in the Israeli news. Don't tune in and just say, I'm making that up.
[36:46.000 --> 36:58.000]  Remember, we were conspiracy theorists till 2004, the 40th anniversary of Gulf of Tonkin, got us into Vietnam.
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  Declassified, it was staged. Of course, we were never conspiracy theorists.
[37:01.000 --> 37:07.000]  It was in the San Diego newspaper when the ships came back six months later.
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  And one of the captains got off and said, this was all staged. I can't morally go along with this lie.
[37:12.000 --> 37:21.000]  See, what you think a conspiracy theory is, is because it becomes a rumor because people lose the original source documents.
[37:21.000 --> 37:24.000]  It's like a game of telephone.
[37:24.000 --> 37:29.000]  And see, I didn't record the news saying they were going to blow up Building 7 on 9-11.
[37:29.000 --> 37:34.000]  And I was just telling people for about two years, and callers were like, yeah, I saw that and heard that too.
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  But only if you'd heard me and seen me.
[37:37.000 --> 37:44.000]  Again, because the internet got so much faster and saving things got so much cheaper, all the old recordings started getting put out.
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.000]  Government made mistakes, re-aired their coverage from CNN.
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.000]  Remember, on one of the anniversary, they just aired the same day stuff again.
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  People were like watching cops going, get back. They're going to bring down 7.
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  We've been ordered to get you back. They're about to blow it up.
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  And the firefighter's going, you saw the lava molten steel.
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  There's no way Jetful did it. You saw the bombs going off.
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  It was popping out. Boom, boom, boom.
[38:09.000 --> 38:15.000]  Remember all those clips we played to you? Over and over and over and over again.
[38:15.000 --> 38:18.000]  Now, I told you, I'd tell you what Rumsfeld said.
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  And then I'd play this clip and then go to your calls.
[38:21.000 --> 38:25.000]  Rumsfeld, attack imminent if Congress cuts defense.
[38:25.000 --> 38:28.000]  Now, how transparent did it have to get?
[38:28.000 --> 38:38.000]  I remember four years ago, five years ago, there was a big scandal with all of the big four network military commentators.
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  And it turned out they were secretly still on Pentagon funds.
[38:41.000 --> 38:47.000]  Some of them were getting paid up to half a million a year to put out certain messages, talking points.
[38:47.000 --> 38:52.000]  We learned with one of them with a general.
[38:52.000 --> 39:00.000]  He gave the interview in Scarfish, you know, it came out that that he'd been told to go out and talk about how martial law might be needed.
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  What was the commander's name in Iraq?
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  He's from Texas.
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  He gave us a he gave a scarfish in auto interview.
[39:09.000 --> 39:10.000]  He'll pop my head in a minute.
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.000]  The point is, it's a tape of all these guys in the room.
[39:14.000 --> 39:19.000]  This was released by the Pentagon strangely enough.
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  And they're going, Mr. Rem, Secretary Rumsfeld, we need another attack.
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  You know it.
[39:25.000 --> 39:31.000]  And I remember all the neocons wrote editorials saying another 9-11 attack would really be great.
[39:31.000 --> 39:32.000]  It became a big controversy.
[39:32.000 --> 39:38.000]  And now these Obama memos where he's being advised, sir, you must have a new attack if our agenda is going to get through.
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  Sir, we need one.
[39:40.000 --> 39:41.000]  Tommy Franks.
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  Tommy Franks.
[39:42.000 --> 39:43.000]  That's right.
[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  Thank you.
[39:44.000 --> 39:52.000]  Even Michael Savage and Glenn Beck have had to go public and say they're getting ready for a new Reichstag.
[39:52.000 --> 39:57.000]  Because if you're in advertising, if you're in media, you know what a talking point is.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  I don't follow talking points.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  But if you're in a big corporate organization, you get them.
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  And it's the talking points.
[40:04.000 --> 40:11.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, somebody's, I'm thinking about making a film just about this or because it takes a lot of research.
[40:11.000 --> 40:17.000]  Or a short film just on the timeline within five minutes on every news channel in the world.
[40:17.000 --> 40:20.000]  They all have the same talking point.
[40:20.000 --> 40:23.000]  British leaders, Israeli, U.S., French, all of them.
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  We've got to give apart liberties.
[40:28.000 --> 40:29.000]  The world has changed forever.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  We're going to have to have a war on terror.
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  We've got to invade Syria, Iraq, Iran, a list.
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  It was a talking point.
[40:36.000 --> 40:42.000]  Osama bin Laden, and there's all these weird tapes of guys very well-spoken, look just like operatives.
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  They're not good spies because they look like textbook CIA.
[40:46.000 --> 40:51.000]  And they're little baseball caps going, yes, I did see the buildings fall because of the jet fuel and the pancaking.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  And it fell into its own self.
[40:53.000 --> 40:58.000]  And on other newscasts, similar-looking guys at the same time just going, oh, yeah, I'm ready to be interviewed.
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  Yes, fell, of course, from the jet fuel and the pancaking.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  The fires were just too hot.
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  Boom, boom, boom.
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.000]  And you're watching it.
[41:05.000 --> 41:13.000]  Just like with JFK, in three different countries in the Pacific where they made a mistake,
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.000]  but was it Thailand, Australia, and one other.
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.000]  You can pull this up.
[41:19.000 --> 41:24.000]  Before Oswald was even arrested, before his name was released, hours before,
[41:24.000 --> 41:32.000]  they had Lee Harvey Oswald's photo and his name because they got their time zones messed up.
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  Any operation like this, they're going to mess up.
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.000]  Now, that key evidence came to us in multiple ways.
[41:38.000 --> 41:51.000]  Jane Stanley and another live channel both put out at the same time that Building 7 had fallen in on itself from fires and gave the official story.
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  While Building 7 was right behind them, 25 minutes before it fell.
[41:54.000 --> 42:02.000]  Now, I went and did research about who gives the BBC their main internal feed and its Reuters.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  And I made videos and predicted.
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  Now, BBC came out and said we were liars.
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  It wasn't real video, which was insane.
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.000]  Then a month later, they said, okay, it was our real video.
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  But we've lost the original tapes.
[42:16.000 --> 42:23.000]  Then we are change England talked to the reporters and both reporters when they were confronted said I never reported on 9 11.
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  I remember taking my son to the theater that day.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  And the guy was obviously lying.
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.000]  And then people go, well, here's the here's the video of it, you know, on a laptop.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  And he goes, oh, now I do remember.
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.000]  Now, again, again, they were told to lie about it.
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  Both definitely operatives.
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  A lot of your national media are intelligence or they get two paychecks.
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.000]  It's called Operation Mockingbird here in the U.S.
[42:49.000 --> 42:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, they and then later I was it was confirmed Reuters had sent them had jumped the gun on the detonation ability.
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.000]  On the detonation of building seven.
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.000]  Is only compounding the problem.
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[43:36.000 --> 43:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[43:41.000 --> 43:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[44:02.000 --> 44:05.000]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Shank and E-Foods Direct.
[44:05.000 --> 44:08.000]  I have E-Foods for my own emergency food supply.
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.000]  You know, Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[44:11.000 --> 44:12.000]  Very different.
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.000]  People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season.
[44:15.000 --> 44:21.000]  And we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes and droughts.
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[44:23.000 --> 44:27.000]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[44:27.000 --> 44:31.000]  The huge issue of the Great Depression is on everyone's mind.
[44:31.000 --> 44:37.000]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  So everyone needs food security.
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping on every food order from E-Foods Direct.
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.000]  That's right, every order gets free shipping starting September 6th.

[44:58.000 --> 45:02.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[45:02.000 --> 45:07.000]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized risk.
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  Saving means to make money.
[45:09.000 --> 45:15.000]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old fashioned real soaps
[45:15.000 --> 45:19.000]  that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[45:19.000 --> 45:24.000]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes,
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials.
[45:26.000 --> 45:31.000]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes,
[45:31.000 --> 45:34.000]  itching sores and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[45:34.000 --> 45:37.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before,
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  you have to do something you've never done before.
[45:39.000 --> 45:44.000]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091

[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  has established an old powerful shadow state.
[46:29.000 --> 46:33.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[46:33.000 --> 46:38.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship,
[46:38.000 --> 46:41.000]  body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.000]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[46:47.000 --> 46:50.000]  The police state isn't coming, it's here.

[47:01.000 --> 47:04.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[47:04.000 --> 47:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:15.000 --> 47:19.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[47:19.000 --> 47:21.000]  in the heart of the Resistance.
[47:21.000 --> 47:25.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.000]  Alright, I'll start going to your calls before this segment ends,
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  but then we're gonna have nothing but calls and a smattering of other economic news
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  in the second hour, but I want to hear from you.
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  On 9-11 then we'll move to the next person.
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  But I started telling the story at the very start of the show,
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  but never finished it just briefly.
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.000]  I was in a radio shack today buying an all-weather emergency radio
[47:47.000 --> 47:50.000]  because our old one I've had for a decade broke.
[47:50.000 --> 47:53.000]  A power supply on it did.
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  And a gentleman came up to me and said,
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  hey, I recognize your voice, he'll steal the radio.
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  He said, why are you still alive?
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  And I get asked that a lot.
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  And imagine being me being asked that every day on the street
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  and in emails and calls.
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  I'm not afraid to die, but I'm certainly not in a hurry to die.
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  I would never commit suicide.
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  And if they kill me, it makes me a martyr.
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  So I believe in God.
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  And, you know, I pray that if it's God's will
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  that he put up a hedge of protection around me.
[48:22.000 --> 48:25.000]  And I know that millions of people pray for me.
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  And I couldn't be doing what I do without you.
[48:28.000 --> 48:33.000]  You know, I believe in providence.
[48:33.000 --> 48:36.000]  And I've boldly stood up and told the truth
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  and let the chips fall where they may.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  And that's why I'm still here today.
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  But they may change their mind.
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  The globalist may do something to me in the future,
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  just out of anger.
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  And if they do, that's the way it is.
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.000]  Because we can't just sit here and cower in the face of death
[48:55.000 --> 48:58.000]  or in the face of being laughed at or ridiculed
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.000]  and go along with the official fable that is 9-11.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  Because even if you believe the official story,
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.000]  it has been used as the head of Homeland Security
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.000]  admitted two years ago in a book, Governor Ridge.
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  It's been used for political purposes.
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  Fake terror alerts, you name it.
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.000]  And all over the country, people now pull up to checkpoints.
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  The TSA is now on the streets.
[49:21.000 --> 49:22.000]  The Army.
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  I seem directing families through whole car scanning systems
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  that are very dangerous.
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  I've had radiologists on.
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  They make chess x-rays look healthy.
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  Well, the border is wide open.
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  That's like leaving the castle gates open,
[49:38.000 --> 49:41.000]  searching everybody in their beds at night
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  and beating little children.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  It makes no sense unless the perpetrators
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  are the military industrial complex
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  and the big banks that own them.
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.000]  It's the oldest trick in the book to attack yourself to take over.
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  It is the oldest trick in the book.
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  And our government has done it over and over again.
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  Other governments have done it.
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  Now, again, it isn't our government, the people that have hijacked it.
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  So I'm begging you.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  I know it's painful.
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  I know it's sad.
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  I know that if you admit these truths to yourself,
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  what are you going to do?
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  I know it's tribal to not like people that don't look like you.
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.000]  And it's kind of fun to get into hating foreigners.
[50:21.000 --> 50:28.000]  But in every case, western governments are financing these people.
[50:28.000 --> 50:31.000]  You know, radical Muslims,
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  and it turns out a lot of them in England are government funded
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  to divide and conquer, can do whatever they want.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  But in the U.K., Daily Mail's reporting,
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.000]  U.K. Bible Recordings deemed offensive.
[50:42.000 --> 50:47.000]  45,000 CDs mailed out to members of the church and the community
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.000]  of the Gospel of Mark are seen as hateful
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.000]  and the mail system refuses to ship them.
[50:55.000 --> 50:59.000]  You know, people get arrested in Canada for reading Bible verses.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  You don't believe me, just search it.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  It's like saying, you know, people get arrested for selling lemonade.
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  Don't believe me, just search it.
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  People can't have gardens in their yard.
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  Don't believe me, just search it.
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  This is the new system.
[51:09.000 --> 51:13.000]  See, they now admit in all their new PSAs,
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  what I told you years ago, has been done behind the scenes.
[51:15.000 --> 51:19.000]  None of the war on terror has to deal with, quote, Muslim extremists.
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  Even if you believe in that and like to get scared of it
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  and like to get freaked out,
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  understand it was always built for everybody.
[51:26.000 --> 51:30.000]  But they start with an unpopular minority first, just like Hitler.
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  You don't know about Operation Northwood, search it.
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  You don't know about building seven, search it.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  Now, this is even more powerful when you watch the video.
[51:37.000 --> 51:41.000]  And the video is up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[51:41.000 --> 51:47.000]  It's titled Public Awakens to Building Seven Hoax.
[51:47.000 --> 51:50.000]  And here's Darren McBrain on the streets in Austin.
[51:50.000 --> 51:54.000]  One of our reporters is from Info Wars Nightly News Friday.
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  And I'm going to do a test.
[51:56.000 --> 51:57.000]  We'll see what happens when we go out.
[51:57.000 --> 51:58.000]  You know, it's a random grab bag.
[51:58.000 --> 52:01.000]  But I'm going to, and I'm going to post these to prisonplanet.tv,
[52:01.000 --> 52:04.000]  not as nightly news, but, you know, as special reports.
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  Well, we're going to go out with a microphone and just ask questions
[52:07.000 --> 52:11.000]  and then give each person one minute at it.
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  We'll do like 30 minutes with a timecode running.
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.000]  And this will be like a poll or a focus group.
[52:16.000 --> 52:20.000]  But we talked to 15 people, all but one think that they blew up
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.000]  building seven or that it's questionable.
[52:23.000 --> 52:24.000]  Looks suspicious.
[52:24.000 --> 52:27.000]  And we didn't put the guy in that disagreed because it was incoherent and long.
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  And we didn't put in all the people that agreed either because, you know,
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  some of them were too long.
[52:31.000 --> 52:32.000]  But here's the quick report.
[52:32.000 --> 52:35.000]  And then I'm going to go out and do an unedited one in the next few weeks
[52:35.000 --> 52:39.000]  on the same subject and just, just, just run a special report
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.000]  where you can see it for yourself.
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.000]  And this is what I've experienced, but we do have scientific polls
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  like New York Times, Angus and Reed.
[52:45.000 --> 52:49.000]  Five years ago, 83% believe the government's lying about what really happened.
[52:49.000 --> 52:52.000]  Of course, six of the 10 commissioners have come out and said it's a criminal coverup.
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  We have articles on that.
[52:54.000 --> 52:57.000]  Let's go ahead and go to this special report.
[52:57.000 --> 52:58.000]  Here it is.
[52:58.000 --> 52:59.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[52:59.000 --> 53:02.000]  I'm Darren McBreen for Info Wars Nightly News.
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  We're here at the University of Texas in Austin just days
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.000]  before the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.000]  And we're wondering how many people are aware that there was a third tower that fell,
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  building seven, which was not hit by a plane,
[53:15.000 --> 53:18.000]  but collapsed demolition style at 5.20pm,
[53:18.000 --> 53:21.000]  many hours after the first two towers fell.
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  What are your thoughts when you see that? This was not hit by an airplane.
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.000]  It collapsed many hours after the first two towers fell.
[53:27.000 --> 53:30.000]  I mean, it sort of looks like a planned demolition,
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  but it could also be a lot of other things.
[53:32.000 --> 53:33.000]  Oh, wow.
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  Have you ever seen that video before?
[53:35.000 --> 53:36.000]  I have, actually.
[53:36.000 --> 53:37.000]  It was, um...
[53:37.000 --> 53:41.000]  This is weird, but it was one of those conspiracy videos I saw,
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  but yeah, it was pretty crazy the video I saw.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  It just, like, dropped straight down.
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  Have you ever seen the video before?
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  I'm not at that building now.
[53:49.000 --> 53:56.000]  Do you find it interesting that it was not featured in the 9-11 commission report?
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  It wasn't featured at all?
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  That is interesting. That is interesting.
[54:00.000 --> 54:03.000]  And it looked, uh, you know, it was very controlled blast, it seems.
[54:03.000 --> 54:06.000]  What are your thoughts when you see that building go down like that?
[54:06.000 --> 54:10.000]  Um, I don't really know what happened to it.
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.000]  I don't think anyone, like, the government probably wouldn't tell us.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  I'm actually in the College of Architecture as a grad student,
[54:16.000 --> 54:20.000]  and have seen several demolitions, and it does look completely controlled.
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  I mean, it looked like a controlled demolition.
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  It didn't look like the explosion happened from, like, one side,
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  like, coming in or anything like that.
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  It looked like it kind of happened from the bottom
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  and just kind of imploded on itself.
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  Is that the first time you've seen the video?
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  Yes, definitely.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  That's the first time I've ever seen that, yeah.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  This is my first time actually hearing about Building 7,
[54:39.000 --> 54:42.000]  so, you know, that tells you how much they've covered it,
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  but, um, that's very weird.
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.000]  It really looks like a demolition implosion.
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  I don't remember saying it at all.
[54:49.000 --> 54:52.000]  I remember watching both the Second Tower collapse live,
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.000]  and I don't remember hearing or seeing anything at the time about that.
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.000]  As most of the Info Wars audience is aware,
[54:59.000 --> 55:02.000]  World Trade Center leaseholder Larry Silverstein
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  gave the okay to pull the building
[55:04.000 --> 55:07.000]  moments before Building 7 collapsed.
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  BBC's Jane Stanley even reported Building 7's collapse
[55:10.000 --> 55:13.000]  minutes before the event actually happened.
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  You can even see Building 7 clearly behind her
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  as she gives the report.
[55:18.000 --> 55:22.000]  Yesterday I watched a video where a news lady was talking
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  and she said the third building just fell,
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.000]  but behind her, the third building had not fallen yet.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.000]  So that's weird.
[55:28.000 --> 55:29.000]  Jane Stanley.
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  You saw that then, yeah.
[55:31.000 --> 55:32.000]  Oh, of course, of course.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  She's like, oh, it fell down and it's still behind her.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  You would think that she would wait until it fell,
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  even if she had inside her information that the thing was going down.
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.000]  She has some sort of ESP.
[55:41.000 --> 55:44.000]  There are currently close to 1,500 architects and engineers
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  who are saying that it was indeed a controlled demolition.
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  Well, I mean, that's the kind of thing where
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  we need some sort of investigation, you know,
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  and if the government isn't going to do this for investigating,
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  then we need the third party to step in and, you know,
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  have the authority and the resources to do that.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  I mean, like a lot of people, you know,
[56:00.000 --> 56:01.000]  question the Warren Commission.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  That doesn't make all of them cooks or conspiracy theorists.
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.000]  What do you feel about losing a lot of our civil liberties
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  since 9-11?
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  Uh, it sucks.
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  You know, you have, you know,
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  people that can invade your phone calls
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  and text messages and emails,
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  and so you really don't have any privacy.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  And that really scares me.
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  I think that 9-11 was sort of the Trojan horse
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  for all that sort of policy to come in.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  If you notice, there's free speech zones.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  We can only free speech in certain areas now.
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.000]  So, yeah, it's almost like everything that we once had
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  is slowly shrinking.
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  Is it worth it to make us more safe to lose our liberties?
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  No, certainly not.
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.000]  I mean, you know, 9-11 was a terrible event.
[56:43.000 --> 56:47.000]  But in terms of the things that have happened
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  since then making us more safe,
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  I'd say that's the other side of the coin.
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.000]  Do you think there needs to be a new investigation
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  into September 11th?
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  I don't think it would hurt.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  I don't know how much we would know about it,
[57:00.000 --> 57:03.000]  or, again, maybe how unbiased it would be.
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  But I think it always is something
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  that is interesting to look at further.
[57:07.000 --> 57:10.000]  I think America should demand a new investigation.
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.000]  Definitely be interesting to see things that
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.000]  I'm sure the government didn't want the public knowing at the time.
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  The only way to get to the bottom of it is to do more research.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  I don't think it's to be the government's corrupt.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  Everyone lies.
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  I don't think people should just put all their faith and trust
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  in a government who is just completely selfish
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  and only worrying about themselves.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  Ten years after 9-11, we could see that
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  much of the public is aware that they're not being told
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.000]  everything there is to know about the tragic events of that.
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.000]  There's a few more minutes of the report, but I just want to add,
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.000]  giving up liberty does not make you more safe.
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  The number one killer of populations is governments.
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.000]  They always use fake crises to set up their police states.
[57:47.000 --> 57:50.000]  We'll be back with a second hour.
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  When you're out on the road,
[57:52.000 --> 57:56.000]  the last place you want to be is on the road.
[57:56.000 --> 57:59.000]  But if the unfortunate happens,
[57:59.000 --> 58:02.000]  you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[58:02.000 --> 58:06.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[58:06.000 --> 58:11.000]  where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.000]  They so pride in every stitch
[58:15.000 --> 58:19.000]  guarantee you love the way they fit.
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  where you need it most.
[58:24.000 --> 58:28.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[58:28.000 --> 58:29.000]  Others don't.
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  We turn jeans inside out.
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  Diamond gusset jeans,
[58:33.000 --> 58:36.000]  made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  so you can ride all day with confidence.
[58:42.000 --> 58:45.000]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[58:45.000 --> 59:00.000]  Diamond gusset jeans got it. Others don't.
[59:15.000 --> 59:16.000]  It's worth it.
[59:16.000 --> 59:18.000]  But only touch a few of us Americans.
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  The huge issue of the Great Depression
[59:20.000 --> 59:22.000]  is on everyone's mind.
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.000]  The unemployment, the loss of homes,
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  lost businesses and skyrocketing food costs
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  are hitting every American
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  so everyone needs food security.
[59:30.000 --> 59:32.000]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.000]  on every food order from EatFoodsDirect.

[59:49.000 --> 59:51.000]  slash Alex.
[59:51.000 --> 59:54.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[59:54.000 --> 59:56.000]  You're listening to the
[59:56.000 --> 59:58.000]  Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]  Network.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  deep behind enemy lines,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  the information war continues.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  Okay, we are back live into
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  hour number two.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  Ten years later,
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  look at how America's changed
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  and the system wants even more of those liberties.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  I'll tell you about a 60 minutes piece I saw.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  I didn't know they re-air 60 minutes on
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  MSNBC
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  that I saw Friday night.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  Unbelievable.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  I knew this was going on from documents
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  but I hadn't seen it.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  I'm going to write a note, I'm going to cover that.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  I mean, it showed the training.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  They're telling cops you will be attacked by terrorists.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  Every school will be attacked.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  We must have arm guards everywhere.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  In every mall, terrorists are coming
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  and they're domestic.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  And they're teaching them.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  It's not al-Qaeda, it's patriots.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  And even 60 minutes was saying
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  it was out of control.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  60 minutes, man.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  They admit we have 30-something percent
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  unemployment in California, 20-plus percent
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  nationwide. They have a lot of anti-gun stuff.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  They're really weird though
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  but they're so arrogant and into doing real reporting
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  that sometimes they're actually honest.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  Really weird.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  Of course, they probably also know
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  it was so over-the-top and ridiculous
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  that they're teaching that every person
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  will be attacked by terrorists
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  and there's terrorists under every table
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  chewing at your feet
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  that to present you to condition you to accept it
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  they throw it in your face.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  But they were saying it's fair-mongering
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  and crazy and you've got a better chance
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  of basically being killed by a honeybee.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  I've got to give credit.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  It was amazing.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  And they were...
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  Well, I'll talk about it later.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Canada.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  John, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  Honored to talk to you. I'll get right to it.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  I'm in Canada but I'm a dual citizen.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  I grew up in California.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  And it's kind of a two-part question.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  It's basically...
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  We know that 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  We know that Kennedy was killed and there was a government coup.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  And we know that there was no provisions
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  in the Constitution or Bill of Rights anywhere
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  for this type of loss of our liberties.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  So at what point do we kind of
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  move into the steps and the roles
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  of our forefathers and kind of step up to this?
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  And the second question is,
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  or do we just always stand down and it's always
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  just an information war and it's always just a war of the mind?
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  Here's the problem.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  You've got to get enough people aware of things
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  because
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  why do they teach the Army
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  if you're outnumbered in an indigenous population
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  hang a couple little kids
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  and plant enemy
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  artifacts at the site?
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  The argument of the officer is
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  you don't want to kill these little kids.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  But if you don't kill a couple,
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  the enemy's going to kill them all.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  Injustifies the means.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  Do you understand, Captain? Yes, sir.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  I understand. And a lot of it's the most patriotic guys.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  He sits there and kills the little kids
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  and hangs them up.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  I've got to do this to beat the commies.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  Because if I don't, they'll kill thousands.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  And of course, he doesn't understand
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  the compartmentalization.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  And so what you've got to understand is
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  if you get
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  the globalist or masters
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  at
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  divide and conquer, co-opting
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  compartmentalization, compartmentalization,
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  compartmentalization, compartmentalization,
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  they know
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  cause and effect.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  They know as they ban
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  lemonade stands and garage sales
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  and beat everybody up and televise it.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  A lot of people, as they cut,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  they're talking about completely getting rid
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  of the 20-year military
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  service people. They've got actuaries
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  knowing, however many percentage points
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  are going to go postal and start killing people.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  Okay?
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  And they're going to call that terrorism
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  and say, see the vets or the terrorists
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  and use the fear to clamp down
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  on everything. So the last thing
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  you want to do is get violent.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  Okay? Just we've got to sit there
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  and not do what they think we're going to do
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  and let their abuse get so
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  horrible and just take it like
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  Gandhi to the moment everybody gets it.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  Now, they're still going to stage stuff.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  That's why we've got to have our people
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  and this is what they're so mad about.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  And there's no going back.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  They've put their foot in the bear trap.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  Our people are everywhere.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  When the government gets the
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  underwear bomber drugged out of his mind,
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  they didn't know where he was according to witnesses.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  Yeah, they just take a drugged out
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  idiot and put him on a plane and then
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  have a firecracker go off in his pants.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  So we've all got to be microwaved.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  When they stage that,
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  okay, we've got people there
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  watching. Stay there. I'm going to let you
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  finish, John, because I was
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  we'll reintroduce your question and have
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  you give me a response. Then I got a hurry.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  Daniel, John, Debbie, Jane, Angie,
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  Nicholas, Robert, Kevin,
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  Karen, Howard and others.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  We're going to talk to you straight ahead
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  infowars.com 9-11.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  You've heard Alex explain how the
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  Silver Lungs Generator infuses the
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  respiratory system with your self-produced
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  colloidal silver solutions. Yet many are
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  unaware of the entire function of the
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  Silver Lungs System and how it has been
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  anywhere in or on the body.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  endless colloidal and ionic silver
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  solutions, it also comes equipped
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  with the proper applicators and devices
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  needed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  directly to key target areas.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  This includes the eyes,
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  ears, nose,
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  lungs, topically to the skin
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  and orally for the digestive system.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  Be sure to watch our new
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  System at www.silverlungs.com
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  System works. As well,
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  we are always ready to answer any
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  questions you may have.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  foreign and domestic.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]  Okay, we have that little 5-minute
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000]  segment that I do that some stations don't
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  even know what it is.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  So, if you just joined us, I was talking to
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  John in Canada, and he said,
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  look, we know there's been a military coup
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  with Kennedy. We know there's foreign
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  interests, financing terrorists, staging
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  events purely. There's fully manufactured.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  There's provocateur.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  There's patchy operations. There's
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  different types of staged events.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  There is the real pure terrorism.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  Very rare. It's really just asymmetrical,
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  non-traditional warfare.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  Anybody that fights back against the
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  T-Partiers and the gun owners,
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  they sold those very people
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  on giving up liberties and building a domestic
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  secret police control grid
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  paramilitary system.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  The name of fighting foreigners
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  knowing in their anthropology
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  actuaries, you would go along with it.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  The whole time it was for you.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  Okay, so that's what's,
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  I go back to Chuck Norris.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  Mr. Get the Muslims for 30 years
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  in all his movies. Mr.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  We got to have with these wars, but still
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  a good guy coming out and going, our
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  government's running Al Qaeda. Our government's
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  helping Al Qaeda in a big editorial
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  and quoting me. See,
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  you've got to come to grips with it.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  It's not us against the Muslims.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  It's banks playing us off against each
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  other who then profit from it all.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  How are banks going to steal tens of
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  trillions of dollars and get away with
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  instead of a police state and
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  taxes also through military industrial
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  complex systems domestically? They're
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  going to stage stuff.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  They're going to go finance groups that, in many
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  cases, the cannon fodder doesn't even know
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  it's been financed.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  Double agents, triple agents.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  We're fighting a very scientific
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  evil and they don't even
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  have to control it all.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  They set things in motion
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  knowing how humans operate.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  They war game it all out.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  All right, now,
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  John, my point is we don't want
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  to get violent because they've
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  already done the algorithms
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  and know the vets who they're telling
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  they're getting ready to take their pension funds are going to get violent.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  They know that. They know that as the
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  system pushes and pushes, people are going
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  to get angry. That's going to now be called
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  terrorism.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  I've seen charges of people in fist
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  fights being charged with terrorism now.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  So, when you just let
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  the tyrants run around
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  and engage in their crimes, try to
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  prosecute them, try to expose them,
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  try to get good district attorneys to go after them,
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  but offensive attacks
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  are the way to go. I'm always for defensively protecting
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  yourself if a criminal of any
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  stripe is in the wrong.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  Now, do you understand
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  the strategy I'm talking about here?
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  The globalists had to bomb their own Oklahoma City
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  to
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  make Bill Clinton look like a victim.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  Now, we got White House memos saying
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  a new 9-11 or Oklahoma City is the only
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  thing that can save Obama. His advisors
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  are coming to him saying, please pull
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  the trigger. And I'm sure
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  there's people above that who are getting
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  ready for it. You can see the pre-programming
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  to shift it over to domestic
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  groups now. I mean, it's an
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  advertising rollout. How do you know what
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  a new Lexus is coming out? You see the ads
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  for it. It's a full
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  PR-driven system. They're getting ready
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  right at the time. They know
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  there's a crest of anger against tyranny
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  politically to blow stuff up,
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  to blame it on the political opposition,
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  to then demonize the political opposition.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  Do you understand that?
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  I do see what you're saying, Alex. It's great to hear
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  about it. And then the second part of that is
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  do we end up losing part of the Republic?
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  Is it like a cancer where if it grows in the stomach
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  eventually they have to take out the whole stomach?
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  And do you see a future with 50 states united
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  in liberty in the future? Are we going to kind of
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  lose some of this when eventually we do?
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  Look, John,
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  America's been dead a long time,
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  but it's not like a person.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  It's a spirit. It's an idea. It can be
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  resurrected any time.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  We empower it.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  So America's already dead, brother.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  The states are already under federal control.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  The feds at the top are all agents
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  of foreign banks. We've been hijacked.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  And it's only admitting
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  just how far we've fallen.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  Then it's not a hope or a prayer.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  It's a guaranteed restoration.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  The minute we get wise,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  the minute we're not childlike
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  and naive is the minute the Republic's
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  back. I appreciate your call.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  Daniel in Louisiana, go ahead. You're on the air.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  Hey, Alex.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  I was calling to see if you had any kind
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  of time for him. I know it's not easy,
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  but when the show might be getting on cable
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  and also to say that when it is on cable,
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  will you
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  show video footage
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  of building seven, show it side by
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  side with known takedowns
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  just to get it out there? Of course I will.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  I made a bunch of films.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  Friday's show, we did that.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  Look, look,
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  to be clear,
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  my TV show could already be
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  on cable systems. It could already
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  be on a Sky TV channel.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  I was offered over
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  the years I've been offered many times,
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  hey, edit your daily radio show together
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  with the camera shoots
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  and do it. I even got calls from
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  sci-fi channel about it
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  and just said I'm not ready yet. I'm too busy
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  because you think you're going to reach a lot
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  of people being on a channel like that.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  It's a big show that has a million viewers.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  I've got three million listeners a day now.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  So we're already reaching a bunch of people.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  There's this prestige about being on TV
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  but
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  again, it's mainly going to be
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  this satellite system, that satellite system,
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  a couple hundred thousand viewers there,
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  a couple hundred thousand there,
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  regional cable system, some TV stations
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  want it. I've got to put in the fiber optic
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  upload system. It costs a bunch of money.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  I've got to hone the show.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  The show isn't ready, but yes, I will tell
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  you, members are always going to get it
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  and get the expanded thing. It's an hour
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  or some nights, two hours, other nights, 30 minutes,
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  other nights. I've never done 30 minutes.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  Now I'm just trying things out.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  This is really beta. M4 Works Nightly News is in beta
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  and I'm trying to get it going
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  as fast as I can.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  My family's great, but it's starting to cause
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  some problems. I'm getting home about 10 o'clock
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  every night right now. So yes,
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  but I mean, does that answer your question?
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  What excites me is the fact that
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  if it is on TV, we've got to come to you now
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  but if it's on TV, people might be channel surfing
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  and if that's in the intro or they're seeing that
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  they might just flip channels and see it
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  side by side in beta. Oh no, there's no doubt
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  that, again, we'll start
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  on little systems and immediately
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  that happens whenever radio station
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  we're on. The ratings only go up.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  Just they're usually little mom and pops, so they go from
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  barely showing up to wow, having
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  a good audience. They've been putting us on
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  big stations and they're going from like number three
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  to number one in places like Orlando.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  These instant people meters
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  are really helping us because it actually shows
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  what we're being listened to. Shows
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  like Rush Limbaugh and stuff where it's just a name.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  Everybody's kind of heard it and lazily
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  puts it in the diary. That's why
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  all the radio stations started going Spanish a few years
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  ago was because they did
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  studies and found that for whatever
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  reason it was mainly the
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  immigrants and people that would
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  fill out the diaries for the five bucks
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  or whatever and then as soon as people meters
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  came back in, you're seeing stuff switch back
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  to English because there really
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  wasn't that big of an audience. I mean,
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  Arbitron diaries are a complete
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  joke and always have been. I mean, if you
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  got a huge show, it is an indicator
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  but it's not to live and die by. These instant
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  people meters, that's another thing
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  entirely and if we keep
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  winning with these they could game them or something
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  but the systems really do want to know
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  but you know what,
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  YouTube, we've reached over 300 million
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  people in the last couple years on
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  YouTube alone. 300 million just on our channels.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  300 million. So we're
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  on the channel. The new channel is
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  YouTube. Over half the video
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  views online in the world are on YouTube. Does that
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  answer your question, Daniel? Thanks
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  Alex. Thank you sir.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  I think I got time to jam in one more. John
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  in Michigan, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  Hi Alex. Great to talk to you about.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  I'll make it quick.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  I studied the
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  Dimitri Kalazov
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  videos. I'm sure you've seen those
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  about the nuclear demolition
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  of World Trade Center.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  There's only a problem of a psychological
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  problem that people have with
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  a nuclear device being activated
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  in the city of New York and
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  I was wondering
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  what your take is on that. Five years
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  ago, five years ago,
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  I guess time flies. I keep saying five.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  I can't believe ten years ago, but I think it was
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  about six, seven years ago.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  I saw
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  online
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  the radioactive isotope readings
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  and thought they were fake.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  And I actually had to go join
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  a major
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  Nuke monitoring site. I even had to
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  subscribe. And sure enough
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  I spent like a week trying to
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  ferret out if this was real. And it is true, isotopes
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  of an atomic blast
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  went off the charts at ground zero.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  Now some
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  nuclear radiologists
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  argued that those isotopes
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  could have been released out of certain types
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  of equipment, but that it was too
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  high. But the evidence does point
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  towards multiple
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  many atomic
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  detonations, just like they knew
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  from Fukushima. Independent scientists got
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  the isotopes showing there had been fission explosions
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  and the mox3 plutonium
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  reactor on that Monday after had blown
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  now for three months, Japan
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  lied. It's now confirmed that they had a
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  complete atomic
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  explosion meltdown at the mox3
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  number three mox reactor.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  And so yes, but I don't even
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  go there because you start getting into that. People
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  just don't get handheld nuclear weapons.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  They don't even know about Davey Crockett's
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  shoulder launched and frogs and things
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  like that. Anything else, sir?
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  I appreciate it.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  Do you ever think about having
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  a man as interviewer? Is that too far? No, that's
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  a great idea. We'll try to get him on.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  Now with the nightly news, we have even more time
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  for guests as well. Every
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  weeknight, 7pm
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  Central, presentplanet.tv
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  We're simulcasting this radio show. This is a TV
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  show. We'll be right back. Stay with us. More calls
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  straight ahead.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  Alex Jones here with vital
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  information concerning our nation's fragile
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  food supply. Folks, there are
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  some truly dangerous trends forming
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  and I think it's important for my listeners to do
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  three things right away. Number
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  one, study the past.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  Number two, learn to
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  Number three,
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  take decisive action.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  A perfect storm is brewing
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  or a global food crisis.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  the new book, Rising Prices
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  Empty Shelves. Warning signs
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  that trigger the deadliest
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  famines in history. Don't get caught
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  This book is only available
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  at RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  You'll also get a free copy

[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  cut your grocery bills in half.

[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones. I'm
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  looking for people that have the wisdom to
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  spot savings, opportunity, and
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  recognized risk. Saving means
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  to make money. The Calben Pure Soap Company
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  can save you thousands of dollars
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  and give you good old fashioned real soaps
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  that are triple concentrated
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  oils that contain no
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants,
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  or antibacterials. Your risk
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  is the hundreds of hazardous toxic
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  detergents that give you rashes,
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  itching sores, and a
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  terrorating clothing called lint.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  If you want something better, if you want
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  something you've never had before, you have to do
