[00:00.000 --> 00:08.800]  media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:08.800 --> 00:20.280]  radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Make a radio broadcast lined
[00:20.280 --> 00:26.480]  up for you today. Wide open phones. All the important news covered here on air. The great
[00:26.480 --> 00:30.480]  grab bag of your calls. People taking us in different directions, bringing up important
[00:30.480 --> 00:37.640]  issues, topics, and stories. It is, of course, ladies and gentlemen, the 11th day of November
[00:37.640 --> 00:46.920]  2008. We have four hours laying out before us. We have a writer joining us coming up
[00:46.920 --> 00:55.760]  in the next hour who's done a report on Homeland Security turning the nations, now a vassal
[00:55.760 --> 01:00.680]  state of global corporate crime syndicate, the nation's spy satellites inward on the
[01:00.680 --> 01:07.840]  American people and tying the local police into them. So the full story on that coming
[01:07.840 --> 01:11.720]  up in the next hour, should be on this about 20 minutes. We have some other guests we're
[01:11.720 --> 01:18.400]  lining up as well today. In other news, we mentioned it yesterday, but I want to get
[01:18.400 --> 01:27.080]  into more detail today on this. $2 trillion of the bailout. That was the Bloomberg headline.
[01:27.080 --> 01:36.480]  It's secret. The private Federal Reserve and the quasi-governmental treasury, it's now quasi-governmental
[01:36.480 --> 01:43.600]  because it's being given separate governmental powers kind of outside of the government to
[01:43.600 --> 01:50.600]  merge with the private Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is eating the government is
[01:50.600 --> 01:57.920]  basically what's happening right now. They just calmly announced, hey, $2 trillion, we're
[01:57.920 --> 02:02.200]  not going to tell you who we gave it to. And you're never going to be told to sit down
[02:02.200 --> 02:10.480]  and shut up. That's exactly what Rumsfeld and General Myers testifying what three years
[02:10.480 --> 02:16.720]  ago now before the House Banking Committee, they just said, we're not going to tell you
[02:16.720 --> 02:21.240]  where it went. We're not going to discuss where it went. And the congressmen and women
[02:21.240 --> 02:25.040]  were saying, but we keep asking you every year where all these trillions have gone.
[02:25.040 --> 02:33.520]  It was $2 trillion in 2001 when the Associated Press reported on it was well over $4 trillion
[02:33.520 --> 02:41.120]  three years ago, the last hearing I saw. And I don't know where it is now. Just total lawlessness.
[02:41.120 --> 02:46.480]  And what are they going to do next? I mean, just stealing everything and saying, we won't
[02:46.480 --> 02:52.240]  even tell you where it went. And with Congress complains, they threaten martial law on them.
[02:56.080 --> 03:02.080]  This is the real issue. So we'll go over this report from Paul Watson
[03:02.080 --> 03:09.680]  upon prisonplanet.com. Fed hides destination of $2 trillion in bailout money, fails to
[03:09.680 --> 03:17.200]  comply with congressional demands for transparency, underscoring age-old problem of top-down socialism
[03:17.200 --> 03:25.040]  and letting the Fox guard the henhouse. Another report here, this is out of the Associated Press
[03:25.040 --> 03:33.920]  today. Georgia congressman warns of Obama dictatorship. That's right, a Republican congressman from
[03:33.920 --> 03:38.960]  Georgia said Monday, he fears the president-elect Obama will establish a Gestapo-like security
[03:38.960 --> 03:44.160]  force to impose a Marxist or fascist dictatorship working on getting him on today.
[03:45.680 --> 03:49.520]  We'll read you his quotes when we get back from break. I sound a bit different. Again,
[03:49.520 --> 03:55.760]  I forgot a chest cold, but news is too important to lay around in bed, so I am here live today.
[03:57.440 --> 03:59.520]  You will hear me pausing from time to time, though.
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.560]  On other economic news, American Express to become bank holding company.
[04:09.760 --> 04:16.080]  So we'll be going over that area of the economy. Worries about housing consumers and stocks
[04:16.080 --> 04:25.920]  lower today, lower big time. Also, snow arrives early in Utah, Colorado, and the other states,
[04:26.480 --> 04:31.920]  and they're having record cold temperatures on a planetary scale right now. That's why they
[04:31.920 --> 04:36.480]  baited and switched you, it's no longer global warming, it's now climate change.
[04:38.080 --> 04:44.160]  And Obama swears with executive order to start carbon taxing and list what you exhale as toxic
[04:44.160 --> 04:51.520]  waste. That way we're all climate criminals, but our children don't worry or climate cops and
[04:51.520 --> 04:57.120]  will stop us. Hello friends, this is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important
[04:57.120 --> 05:01.120]  to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent,
[05:01.120 --> 05:05.920]  and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[05:05.920 --> 05:10.080]  You'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family. In any
[05:10.080 --> 05:14.640]  emergency, if you simply prepare, our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[05:14.640 --> 05:18.560]  for a special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it. They turned off the
[05:18.560 --> 05:24.160]  telephones and email. They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air. This money
[05:24.160 --> 05:28.880]  now owns the American and European banks. The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[05:28.880 --> 05:34.160]  will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond
[05:34.160 --> 05:39.360]  many Americans reach. In pre-Nazi Germany, super inflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled
[05:39.360 --> 05:44.880]  every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks. Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[05:44.880 --> 05:49.440]  there seems as if there may be no end in sight. The private banks merging with our government
[05:49.440 --> 05:54.000]  are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves. The stores have less food,
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.720]  but jack of prices to stay in business. Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and
[05:58.720 --> 06:02.960]  be ready. Everything is zeroing in on food. One third of Americans have to choose between
[06:02.960 --> 06:07.680]  buying food and paying for other necessities. My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared,
[06:07.680 --> 06:11.600]  get self-sufficient, get food. For everybody out there listening, it's very important for
[06:11.600 --> 06:14.960]  you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new
[06:14.960 --> 06:19.920]  old order has a lot less control over you. And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency
[06:19.920 --> 06:24.080]  and preparedness. No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.
[06:24.080 --> 06:28.480]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli,
[06:28.480 --> 06:33.200]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports. And they do it at almost half the cost of last
[06:33.200 --> 06:39.840]  year's grocery prices. Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com. Visit
[06:39.840 --> 06:44.880]  eFoodsDirect.com and look over the final list of high quality, freeze dried, and dehydrated foods
[06:44.880 --> 06:52.080]  they have to offer. Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[06:52.080 --> 06:59.360]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Take action today. The first step is getting
[06:59.360 --> 07:07.360]  storable food. From his central Texas command center, deep behind enemy lines, the information
[07:07.360 --> 07:12.080]  war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[07:18.800 --> 07:22.880]  Okay, we're covering the fact that local police are being federalized and being given
[07:22.880 --> 07:29.200]  the live tracking systems to dial into your cell phone to listen to you without warrants.
[07:29.200 --> 07:33.600]  Not even when you're using the phone to talk on it, but to dial in and use it as a microphone
[07:33.600 --> 07:39.440]  to use the spy satellites that are supposedly to fight the Ruskies and the Iranians against
[07:39.440 --> 07:44.400]  the American people and a lot more that is coming up. I want to get into the subject of
[07:44.400 --> 07:52.080]  martial law and the denial of people out there. You know, instead of all the neocons and mainline
[07:52.080 --> 07:59.760]  liberals who heard myself and many others over the last decade plus, warned them about the
[07:59.760 --> 08:05.760]  erosion of Posse Comintas, the integration and militarization of police, merging them with the
[08:05.760 --> 08:14.640]  military, the move towards compulsory national service. All the urban warfare drills going on
[08:14.640 --> 08:20.480]  with the military is openly training with local police to confiscate our firearms toward a door
[08:20.480 --> 08:27.600]  or instead of seeing all of that come true now, seeing all of that being openly announced.
[08:27.600 --> 08:32.080]  Oh yeah, we've gotten rid of Posse Comintas. Yeah, we're training the confiscate guns.
[08:33.920 --> 08:41.040]  Yeah, we may need to declare martial law. The John Warner Defense Authorization Act
[08:41.040 --> 08:46.960]  stating that the presidents above all the governors and can use the military against
[08:46.960 --> 08:52.640]  the American people whenever he wants in the high-powered microwave guns on and on and on.
[08:58.240 --> 09:02.400]  Instead of people saying, wow, these guys were right.
[09:05.120 --> 09:08.720]  These guys were onto something. We better listen more carefully to them.
[09:09.280 --> 09:13.360]  Man, major newspapers are admitting the government's built all these FEMA camps for the American people.
[09:13.360 --> 09:19.040]  Instead, our detractors, and I'm watching them on the message boards and the emails I get,
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.360]  and I hear them on talk radio, and it's a discussion in newspapers, and they say,
[09:23.360 --> 09:28.000]  oh, where did the martial law go that Bush was going to declare for the election?
[09:30.000 --> 09:36.080]  Where is it, Alex? You said he was going to do it for the election and suspend things,
[09:36.080 --> 09:44.160]  and it didn't happen. Do you know what that's called? That's called a straw man, a straw man.
[09:45.920 --> 09:52.400]  They make up something that you didn't say and then attribute it to you and then claim that you're
[09:52.400 --> 10:00.560]  wrong. That'd be like saying Alex Jones said Planet X was going to smash into the earth in 2002
[10:00.560 --> 10:05.040]  and kill everybody. No, I went on air and said that was a hoax and that it was baloney,
[10:05.040 --> 10:10.960]  and then it wasn't real. Doesn't matter. There are websites and news articles lying saying I did say that.
[10:14.400 --> 10:18.080]  And what did I say two, three, four months ago, six months ago, a year ago? I said
[10:18.640 --> 10:24.320]  they have set up the apparatus, the systems of martial law and federalization,
[10:24.880 --> 10:30.000]  and in slow motion, they're already without a shot being fired, federalizing the counties,
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.280]  the cities, the states, the regions, the nation, and then that goes under international control
[10:35.280 --> 10:48.160]  through treaty. The banking system now going under martial law of the international elite,
[10:48.160 --> 10:51.840]  where the smaller banks and insurance companies and financial institutions
[10:53.840 --> 10:58.080]  have a private group of banks above them that have governmental power through the
[10:58.080 --> 11:03.040]  nations they control through the debts and through their think tanks and round table
[11:03.040 --> 11:10.320]  grips, and they order them, they instruct them to carry out their policies. And now all of that
[11:10.320 --> 11:20.800]  is being announced exactly like we said it would. And so we have people living in denial about it.
[11:20.800 --> 11:29.040]  You see, martial law is the Congress being threatened with martial law if they don't follow their orders.
[11:34.400 --> 11:42.800]  Martial law is when the federal government is completely run by a small intergroup through
[11:42.800 --> 11:48.080]  the executive that does whatever it wants, whenever it wants, however it wants, and says
[11:48.080 --> 11:54.800]  that it's above the law, which we have. It's martial law when the police are paramilitary.
[11:55.680 --> 12:01.840]  It's martial law when you have a giant portion of your population in prison. It's martial law
[12:01.840 --> 12:04.400]  when you see due process being thrown out the window.
[12:09.040 --> 12:14.160]  And so we have this incremental buildup. Now at any time, this month, six years from now,
[12:14.160 --> 12:22.720]  I don't know, at any time they could stage more terror attacks or provocateur terror attacks
[12:22.720 --> 12:27.680]  or release a biological weapon and blame it on foreign imaginary terrorist
[12:29.520 --> 12:35.920]  or claim that it was just naturally occurring and use that as a way to accelerate the consolidation
[12:35.920 --> 12:45.760]  over society. And they have set it up that way so they can pose as the saviors time and time again.
[12:48.640 --> 12:50.160]  So that is the bottom line here.
[12:54.800 --> 12:56.480]  So we have a congressman
[12:56.480 --> 13:07.920]  come out in the Associated Press and say this. Georgia congressman warns of Obama dictatorship.
[13:07.920 --> 13:11.760]  A Republican congressman from Georgia said Monday he fears that President-elect Obama
[13:12.320 --> 13:17.680]  will establish a Gestapo-like security force to impose a Marxist or fascist dictatorship.
[13:18.320 --> 13:23.040]  That's coming along with this guy's getting that it can be communist or fascist. The bankers
[13:23.040 --> 13:30.240]  like both. Anything centralized. It may sound a bit crazy and off base, but the thing is he's the one
[13:30.240 --> 13:35.760]  who proposed this national security force, Representative Paul Brown said of Obama in an
[13:35.760 --> 13:40.000]  interview Monday with the Associated Press. I'm just trying to bring attention to the fact
[13:40.000 --> 13:46.240]  that we may or may not, I hope not, but that we may have a problem with the type of philosophy
[13:46.240 --> 13:52.800]  or radical socialism or Marxism. Brown cited a July speech by Obama that was circulated on the
[13:52.800 --> 13:57.920]  internet in which the then Democratic presidential candidate called for a national force to take
[13:57.920 --> 14:03.280]  some of the national security burden off the military. That's exactly what Hitler did in Nazi
[14:03.280 --> 14:08.720]  Germany and that's exactly what the Soviet Union did, Brown said. When he's proposing to have a
[14:08.720 --> 14:15.120]  national security force that's answering to him, this is a strong, that is as strong as the U.S.
[14:15.120 --> 14:22.560]  military, he's showing me signs of being Marxist. Obama's comments about a national security force
[14:22.560 --> 14:29.280]  came during a speech in Colorado about building a new civilian service corps. Among other things,
[14:29.280 --> 14:36.160]  he called for expanding the nation's force, foreign service, and doubling the size of the peace corps
[14:36.160 --> 14:42.800]  to renew our diplomacy. That's not what he was doing. He proposed a domestic intelligence force
[14:42.800 --> 14:49.200]  of a million plus people and he proposed compulsory national service for basically all ages and then
[14:49.200 --> 14:54.960]  that's all in his chief of staff's book, Rahm Emanuel, that was all on change.gov until two
[14:54.960 --> 15:00.400]  days ago when they jerked it down and that's made national news that they did pull it so don't try
[15:00.400 --> 15:11.440]  to spin it AP. This is what Obama said, we cannot continue to rely on our military in order to
[15:11.440 --> 15:16.640]  achieve the national security objectives that we set out. Obama said in July, continuing the quote,
[15:16.640 --> 15:22.560]  we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[15:22.560 --> 15:31.840]  just as well funded. Brown who said he also believes Obama will move to ban gun ownership
[15:31.840 --> 15:37.040]  if he does build a national police force. Obama has said he respects the Second Amendment right
[15:37.040 --> 15:42.320]  to bear arms and favors common sense gun laws. Gun rights advocates interpret that as meaning he'll
[15:42.320 --> 15:47.040]  at least enact curves on the ownership of assault weapons and concealed weapons. Well,
[15:47.040 --> 15:51.680]  yeah, he's wanted to ban all those. He said no concealed carry, no assault weapons, which is
[15:51.680 --> 15:56.720]  basically any semi-automatic rifle. As an Illinois state lawmaker, Obama supported a ban
[15:57.840 --> 16:02.560]  on semi-automatic weapons, banning them, period folks. This is AP admitting that
[16:02.560 --> 16:07.840]  and tighter restrictions on firearms generally. He also wants to ban gun shows. He wants to ban
[16:07.840 --> 16:13.520]  all 223 and 308 calibers, 50 cal. He wants you to have to physically register them all.
[16:14.160 --> 16:21.840]  It's basically Chicago 98% gunman. We can't be lulled into complacency, Brown said.
[16:21.840 --> 16:25.440]  You have to remember that Adolf Hitler was elected in the Democratic Germany.
[16:25.440 --> 16:29.040]  I'm not comparing him to Adolf Hitler. What I'm saying is there is that potential.
[16:29.040 --> 16:32.800]  Obama's transition office did not respond immediately to Brown's remarks. So
[16:32.800 --> 16:38.960]  this is really good news because it shows that people are really putting heat on Obama and
[16:38.960 --> 16:44.960]  really seeing how dangerous the people that control him are. The point is, we're hearing
[16:44.960 --> 16:50.000]  in the media, he's going to keep the troops in Iraq for 18 months before looking at it again.
[16:51.200 --> 16:56.000]  Well, Bush has done that for almost six years. By the time Obama gets in, it will be basically
[16:56.000 --> 17:04.160]  six years, six years in March. So about a month, two months short of six years. And he's saying,
[17:04.160 --> 17:10.240]  well, it'll be seven and a half years. It's seven and a half years out, then we'll look.
[17:10.240 --> 17:13.440]  Another year and a half on that six years, and then I'll look at it.
[17:15.920 --> 17:18.720]  And he can do what Bush did. Remember when Bush two years ago pulled out
[17:18.720 --> 17:26.240]  30,000 and then sent 60,000 back, it'll be hailed. Oh, look, parades of troops returning.
[17:28.240 --> 17:33.360]  Kind of like mission accomplished on the aircraft carrier. You watch Obama within three or four
[17:33.360 --> 17:38.400]  months of being in office will go to a parade. It'll be all over TV. There'll be four or five
[17:38.400 --> 17:44.640]  thousand troops and they'll say that the troops are returning. And the public will say, well,
[17:44.640 --> 17:54.640]  he kept his promise. Form over reality, packaging over substance.
[17:56.960 --> 18:01.600]  And there's all these news articles about hundreds of things to be reversed by Barack Obama.
[18:05.520 --> 18:10.480]  Hundreds and hundreds of executive orders and signing statements to be reversed. And then
[18:10.480 --> 18:18.080]  you read what he's saying. He'll reverse Bush kind of milk toast blocked global warming taxes.
[18:18.080 --> 18:23.600]  But then the last year, no, that's since Istanbul year and a half. He's totally
[18:24.160 --> 18:29.920]  capitulate and said, yeah, we'll have the global tax. So Obama's saying, I'm going to reverse Bush.
[18:29.920 --> 18:36.480]  I'll bring you a tax on all human respiration, a tax to breathe. That's what it is. New York Times
[18:36.480 --> 18:44.320]  called it that. And he'll change the language a little bit on torture. And that's basically
[18:44.320 --> 18:50.000]  going to be it. All right, I want to finish up with Marshall Long. And then I want to get into
[18:51.120 --> 18:55.840]  the two trillion dollar reserve says, look, we've taken two trillion in your tax money.
[18:55.840 --> 18:59.840]  And we're not going to tell you where Jack's squad of it is comprende

[20:01.920 --> 20:06.560]  government knows way too much about your financial affairs? I continue to hear stories about property
[20:06.560 --> 20:11.600]  seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds. It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[20:11.600 --> 20:15.760]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[20:15.760 --> 20:22.320]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984 and the

[21:04.800 --> 21:11.680]  war against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden.
[21:11.680 --> 21:16.000]  This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.320]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[21:20.320 --> 21:25.040]  intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are
[21:25.040 --> 21:31.920]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli
[21:31.920 --> 21:37.600]  citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[21:37.600 --> 21:41.840]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games,
[21:41.840 --> 21:47.520]  the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com,

[23:22.640 --> 23:30.480]  Slowly to accept police and paramilitary dress, surveillance, lockdown of major parts of cities
[23:30.480 --> 23:36.480]  for trivial issues, being questioned, being told they can't demonstrate, having police dress up
[23:36.480 --> 23:41.440]  like protesters to riot so they can set the precedent to ban demonstrating without permits,
[23:41.440 --> 23:49.360]  which they then don't issue, on and on and on. And these are the basic staples of a third world
[23:49.360 --> 23:55.120]  country. Now, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act that Barack Obama isn't talking about repealing
[23:56.080 --> 24:02.560]  clearly states that the president is a dictator. Presidential Decision Directive 51 states that
[24:02.560 --> 24:08.160]  the continuity of government is run by the executive in the House and the Senate has no purview
[24:08.160 --> 24:12.880]  and is not involved. Despite the fact that they are co-equal with the executive, they pass the
[24:12.880 --> 24:19.680]  laws and then he executes and then if he gets out of line, they can call him before Congress. If
[24:19.680 --> 24:26.080]  you really read what the Founders said, it was not a co-equal government of the legislative
[24:26.080 --> 24:32.560]  executive and judicial. The judicial is dominant at the federal and state level because it has
[24:32.560 --> 24:38.800]  the most members and you don't want the state to be able to do things quickly or be able to
[24:38.800 --> 24:44.480]  unify quickly. You want to give people time to wake up to dictators or corrupt combinations of
[24:44.480 --> 24:53.120]  people working together. That's why the legislators would appoint these senators federally. People
[24:53.120 --> 24:58.960]  say, well, why would you want that? You know, they're not elected. Don't you want to elect them?
[24:58.960 --> 25:05.520]  You do elect your legislators and then they appoint the senator. The senator is a creature of the
[25:05.520 --> 25:16.160]  state. So again, another example of the legislative system, the legislative branch being above,
[25:17.360 --> 25:24.080]  though only slightly, the executive and the judicial. It is the legislative that can drag
[25:24.080 --> 25:28.880]  in Supreme Court justices and impeach them. It is the legislative that can drag in presidents
[25:28.880 --> 25:35.360]  and impeach them. It is the state legislatures that can drag in a federal senator and impeach
[25:35.360 --> 25:45.040]  them or drag in a governor and impeach them. You understand? But now it is, as they say,
[25:46.480 --> 25:54.320]  but backwards to make it family friendly. Where the executive tells the Congress and the
[25:54.320 --> 26:00.480]  Homeland Security Committee, you don't even get to see PDD 51, but here's the cover sheet.
[26:00.480 --> 26:11.120]  It says you don't run anything. And now we have all these members of Congress.
[26:12.400 --> 26:16.800]  There's Brad Sherman. Just five weeks ago, four and a half weeks ago, saying we've been
[26:16.800 --> 26:22.080]  threatened with martial law if we don't pass this banker takeover bill. And here we are,
[26:22.080 --> 26:26.960]  four and a half weeks later, and they now admit two trillion. We've now got the number,
[26:26.960 --> 26:33.680]  Bloomberg and AP, two trillion, and they won't say who they gave it to. Go ahead and play the
[26:33.680 --> 26:40.800]  clip. Eddie from Ohio, the only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining
[26:40.800 --> 26:47.600]  a panic atmosphere. That atmosphere is not justified. Many of us were told in private
[26:47.600 --> 26:54.560]  conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday that the sky would fall,
[26:54.560 --> 26:59.360]  the market would drop two or 3,000 points the first day, another couple of thousand the second day,
[26:59.920 --> 27:05.920]  and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[27:07.040 --> 27:14.000]  That's what I call fear mongering, unjustified, proven wrong. We've got a week. We've got two
[27:14.000 --> 27:20.080]  weeks to write a good bill. The only way to write to pass a bad bill, keep the panic pressure on.
[27:20.080 --> 27:25.280]  Now, what has the Senate done to this bill? All right. Now, in the final bill,
[27:26.320 --> 27:31.200]  it said that no one can investigate the Treasury Secretary, no one, no government,
[27:31.200 --> 27:38.480]  no body, no court, no law enforcement agency, no one can, should I pull up, read it to you again,
[27:39.360 --> 27:45.840]  can investigate them. But it added some flowery language for the public that said,
[27:45.840 --> 27:54.160]  if the Treasury Secretary and if the Fed Chairman want to create an advisory board that will report
[27:54.800 --> 27:58.640]  back to them or recommend what they should do in the future,
[27:59.760 --> 28:04.320]  so then they have their appointed body say, we say give you all the power, kind of like
[28:04.320 --> 28:09.760]  the 9-11 Commission. Surveil everyone, turn America into a complete police state,
[28:09.760 --> 28:14.240]  and turn everything over to global private banks. Make them thumbs scanned by and sell.
[28:14.240 --> 28:18.560]  Give them national ID cards. Well, that had already all been set up basically.
[28:19.120 --> 28:23.360]  They said, see, the independent commission appointed by us, appointed by the executive
[28:23.360 --> 28:30.000]  that carried out the attacks, says we need all this. I mean, did you go read the bill? I did.
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.440]  I had experts on about it as well. They didn't take an expert to read it and know what it said,
[28:33.440 --> 28:40.560]  but the experts concurred. So now when we get back, we're under martial law. It's a martial law
[28:40.560 --> 28:45.920]  under the executive and the private corporate roundtable groups that control it. All right.
[28:45.920 --> 28:49.040]  And like I said a year ago, two years ago, nothing to do with Bush.
[28:51.040 --> 28:57.760]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[29:16.720 --> 29:22.080]  water without use of animal protein, nitrates or saline solutions. Because our colloidal silver
[29:22.080 --> 29:27.280]  is made up of nano sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level and germs

[29:32.560 --> 29:37.120]  broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold and copper with a money bag
[29:37.120 --> 29:42.000]  guarantee on the colloidal products we produce. For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in
[29:42.000 --> 29:46.880]  the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God given rights of healthcare and freedom

[32:28.720 --> 32:36.640]  You'll have a thriving country and nation state, an empire when you don't have corruption in the
[32:36.640 --> 32:45.600]  system. But throughout time you always get decadent elites that want even more power and control.
[32:45.600 --> 32:51.360]  They will rob, cheat and steal. They will declare emergencies. They will start wars to get political
[32:51.360 --> 32:59.120]  support. They will bring in the federal police, the federal military, into Rome, into Washington,
[33:00.000 --> 33:11.920]  into London, into Paris, into Cairo, into Israel. And it's the same thing. They just have a slick
[33:12.800 --> 33:19.760]  national security state here in the United States. And they went in and threatened Congress
[33:19.760 --> 33:29.280]  to sign over unlimited power or martial law would be declared. And they pointed out to them that
[33:29.280 --> 33:39.600]  under PDD 51 that the executive had the power to do that. Now, if that isn't being buffaloed,
[33:39.600 --> 33:44.560]  that'd be like if I showed up at your door and said, I just have this contract. I just wrote up
[33:44.560 --> 33:50.320]  and I'm just claiming that you have to give me your house. But maybe I was wearing a fancy uniform.
[33:50.320 --> 33:54.240]  That's what uniforms going back thousands of years ago were about. They'd be bold,
[33:54.800 --> 34:00.880]  bright colors, lots of little jewels or rubies or signets, logos of power.
[34:03.280 --> 34:08.000]  You know, the king would wear a crown with a god on it. And he'd say, look, this is the symbol
[34:08.000 --> 34:16.240]  that I speak for the God or I am a God. And they'd say, okay. And that's really what tyranny is.
[34:17.200 --> 34:22.720]  But they did it all, though, not to rob the treasury, not to transfer trillions to the
[34:22.720 --> 34:27.440]  private banks, not to implode the economy so they could consolidate it, not because government or
[34:27.440 --> 34:33.440]  elites wanted power, not because they wanted a new world order. No, elites have never wanted power
[34:33.440 --> 34:37.680]  to rule. There's never been empires. There's never been subterfuge. They did it because they wanted
[34:37.680 --> 34:46.000]  to keep you safe from Al Qaeda. And that's why they're federalizing local police. And that's why
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.200]  they're taking our liberties and freedoms. And that's why they do urban warfare drills.
[34:51.920 --> 34:55.200]  I've been talking about this often on the last few weeks. People keep emailing me saying,
[34:55.200 --> 34:58.640]  Alex, why aren't you covering this? You're not tuning in when we do cover. I covered it
[34:58.640 --> 35:05.120]  some yesterday again. There is a big Northcom yearly drill they did even before Northcom was
[35:05.120 --> 35:11.040]  set up where the shadow government in Denver and Colorado Springs practices taking over the
[35:11.040 --> 35:15.520]  United States under nuclear, chemical, and biological attack. They're simulating three nukes
[35:15.520 --> 35:20.880]  going off. There'll be lots of federalization of local police drills, lots of handing over power
[35:20.880 --> 35:25.760]  from the governors of the feds drills. That's all this is, is going through drinking the Kool-Aid
[35:25.760 --> 35:30.800]  like Jim Jones had them do drills four or five times a day about when they say so, drink the Kool-Aid.
[35:30.800 --> 35:39.920]  And if people resist, inject them with the Kool-Aid. And it is the same story here.
[35:42.800 --> 35:48.000]  And you can go to the urban warfare drills and for the media, they'll have a decontamination
[35:48.000 --> 35:54.000]  truck spraying some firemen off and they'll say, see, keep you safe. But behind the scenes,
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.560]  there's U.S. Army officers in the police department training them for gun confiscation,
[35:58.560 --> 36:04.560]  and you can go out and find those urban drills and get them on video. And we have, and it's in
[36:04.560 --> 36:16.160]  my police state films, the three films, the trilogy. But no one can deny that we are living in the
[36:16.160 --> 36:22.320]  middle of a rogue criminal government. No one who is being honest with themselves can deny that that
[36:22.320 --> 36:30.000]  is exactly what's happening right now. This story is up on prisonplanet.com. Everyone needs to read it.
[36:30.960 --> 36:35.360]  Bloomberg and AP and others reported the same thing, but this adds more of the history so
[36:35.360 --> 36:41.040]  people get a fuller view on what's happening. It's not even editorializing to point out that
[36:41.040 --> 36:48.720]  this is a heist, a robbery, totally criminal. Bloomberg and AP will not say that. We will.
[36:48.720 --> 36:57.920]  They just calmly report that this is happening. Fed hides destination of two trillion in bailout
[36:57.920 --> 37:04.480]  money, fails to comply with congressional demands for transparency, underscores age-old problem
[37:04.480 --> 37:09.760]  of top-down socialism in letting the Fox guard the henhouse. The Federal Reserve is facing a lawsuit
[37:09.760 --> 37:14.880]  after it failed to comply with congressional demands for transparency and disclosed the
[37:14.880 --> 37:22.240]  destination of at least at least two trillion in bailout funds. He's telling you what an 850 bill,
[37:22.240 --> 37:27.360]  folks. Ron Paul's analyzed it. Others have analyzed that they say it's at least five trillion,
[37:27.360 --> 37:34.960]  probably more like 10, could be as high as 25. But in a month and a few days, it's two-trill,
[37:35.840 --> 37:41.520]  two-trill. Not one dime going to get the economy going. They're hoarding it all, buying up other
[37:41.520 --> 37:50.640]  banks, and shutting off the money supply. They do that so they can buy stuff up cheaper,
[37:52.720 --> 37:58.000]  underscoring once again the failure of top-down socialism in the folly of trusting the Fox's
[37:58.000 --> 38:03.520]  guard henhouse. The Federal Reserve is refusing to identify the recipients of almost two trillion
[38:03.520 --> 38:09.360]  of emergency loans from American taxpayers or the troubled assets the central bank is accepting
[38:09.360 --> 38:16.160]  as Kalana Rule reports Bloomberg. Remember that they even admitted to mainstream news. Well,
[38:16.160 --> 38:18.880]  we didn't want to give people a number that was too big to scare them, but we wanted to give
[38:18.880 --> 38:23.040]  them a number that was big enough so they could get an idea. So we just chose 700 billion. That's
[38:23.040 --> 38:29.520]  right. The legislation just says we make the Treasury king, we make the private banks king,
[38:29.520 --> 38:34.560]  the private banks can merge with the government, not the government take over the banks. See,
[38:34.560 --> 38:38.960]  they get governmental power and governmental regulators to go take over their competition,
[38:38.960 --> 38:42.560]  but then it's non-voting shares the government holds with them.
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.480]  So it's like an inner breeding. They're breeding the government with the new world order. Oh,
[38:50.480 --> 38:56.400]  what a monster. What an ogre-like troll they've created. The Federal Reserve is refusing to
[38:56.400 --> 39:00.560]  identify the recipients of two trillion of emergency loans from American taxpayers or
[39:00.560 --> 39:06.640]  the troubled assets the central bank is accepting as collateral. That chairman, Ben S. Bernanke,
[39:06.640 --> 39:11.280]  and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in September they would comply with congressional
[39:11.280 --> 39:18.160]  demands for transparency and a 700 billion bailout of the banking system. Two months later,
[39:18.160 --> 39:23.840]  as the Fed lends far more than a separate rescue program that didn't require approval from Congress.
[39:26.880 --> 39:31.520]  Again, two months later, this is separate from the two trillion, as the Fed lends far more than
[39:31.520 --> 39:36.080]  in separate rescue programs that didn't require approval from Congress. Americans have no idea
[39:36.080 --> 39:41.040]  where their money is going or what securities the banks are peddling and pledging in return.
[39:41.680 --> 39:49.360]  Bloomberg has requested details of the Fed lending under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act
[39:50.240 --> 39:54.560]  filed a separate lawsuit and effort to find out where the money has gone.
[39:58.800 --> 40:03.520]  President-elect Barack Obama, who in September 22 campaign speech promised to make
[40:03.520 --> 40:08.080]  our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure our business is the people's
[40:08.080 --> 40:12.560]  business, refused to comment on the story when contacted by Bloomberg, which is no surprise.
[40:13.760 --> 40:18.880]  Considering the fact that this is the man who guaranteed change has indicated he will not
[40:18.880 --> 40:24.560]  only follow the Bush administration policy of a socialized financial system, I disagree that
[40:24.560 --> 40:29.360]  it socializes, this is just a heist, and I'm even for socialism, that's not what it is.
[40:29.360 --> 40:34.480]  The policy of socialized financial system, but radically expanded it. See, it'd be socialized
[40:34.480 --> 40:41.360]  if we got the money, it would devalue the currency, corrupt government groups would grow up around
[40:43.120 --> 40:48.080]  the money, you know, the favors for who was given the money, that would be bad enough.
[40:48.080 --> 40:53.200]  This is just, it all goes offshore, we get nothing, except paying for it in tax money.
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.240]  The Fed's secrecy on the issue of where the bailout money is going underscores the age
[40:58.240 --> 41:02.960]  old problem with the top-down socialism as a tool of reshaping the economic landscape.
[41:02.960 --> 41:08.560]  The promise to fairly redistribute the wealth will, with full accountability to achieve a
[41:08.560 --> 41:14.160]  solution that will ultimately benefit everyone, is trumped by the cold reality of the fact that
[41:14.160 --> 41:19.040]  corrupt elites, once the taxpayers have been suckered into believing the lie, merely hoard all
[41:19.040 --> 41:23.840]  the money for themselves and don't redistribute it to anyone apart from their own inner circle of
[41:23.840 --> 41:32.000]  cronies. Absolutely. Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, it's just always the same. Indeed, the banks
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.920]  have admitted that they are hoarding the cash, there's hyperlinks to all these claims remaining,
[41:35.920 --> 41:40.400]  indeed the banks have admitted, jokingly, it's very funny to them, and it is kind of funny. I
[41:40.400 --> 41:45.280]  mean imagine if you're them an evil, it's real funny. I mean to be raping people like this has
[41:45.280 --> 41:49.840]  never been done, nothing on this scale, I mean just gobbling trillions up in front of everyone
[41:49.840 --> 41:54.240]  and laughing about it. Indeed, the banks have admitted that they are hoarding the cash and will
[41:54.240 --> 41:59.360]  keep on doing so while bigwigs reward themselves with fat bonuses as the real economy sinks deeper
[41:59.360 --> 42:05.280]  into the toilet. By design, I would add. But what else could we expect upon hearing that
[42:05.280 --> 42:10.480]  ex-Goldman Sachs executive Neil Kashkari was appointed by Paulson to dole out the old gotten
[42:10.480 --> 42:16.000]  gains of the bailout for the rest of the corporate crooks? And that's why they're so confident,
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.880]  because that's what the national security state was set up for. When they set up national security
[42:20.880 --> 42:29.920]  states in Guatemala or Brazil or Argentina or Germany or Japan, they bankrupt the government
[42:29.920 --> 42:33.920]  and reorganize it with the private banks on everything. This is how they take over third
[42:33.920 --> 42:39.760]  world countries and first world nations. It's happening here, now. In fact, the sucking the
[42:39.760 --> 42:45.120]  money out of us, they don't even particularly need that money, because they've got fractional
[42:45.120 --> 42:51.280]  reserve banking and could still continue to do it. It's about bankrupting us. They're going to see,
[42:51.280 --> 42:56.240]  we're going to owe all this. They don't just steal the money, folks. You've got to pay for it
[42:57.760 --> 43:04.640]  to the tax man and in inflation. If you let the fox guard the hen house, then he's going to eat
[43:04.640 --> 43:12.160]  the chickens. In this case, the Fed and the gaggle of Bankster bastard banker children sucking on
[43:12.160 --> 43:18.320]  its teat, gobbled up five trillion plus in taxpayers' money and then figuratively
[43:18.880 --> 43:23.280]  stuck the middle finger up when questions were asked about where the money was going.
[43:23.920 --> 43:29.360]  And see, that's the boldness of these criminals. They just do it with such flares, such openness,
[43:29.360 --> 43:35.600]  such... I mean, they go on TV and just laugh at us. The head of Goldman Sachs was interviewed
[43:35.600 --> 43:39.280]  by the New York Times and just laughed and said, we're keeping it all and we're buying up good
[43:39.280 --> 43:43.920]  banks. We're buying up banks that aren't in trouble and started laughing at them. It's funny
[43:44.640 --> 43:49.520]  like Carl Robes said, we control reality and then we'll change that reality again and then you'll
[43:49.520 --> 43:53.760]  go along with that. And what do you think they're doing with Barack Obama? They totally control him
[43:54.720 --> 43:58.640]  and they're laughing. They will change reality again and then you'll report on that reality.
[43:58.640 --> 44:09.840]  In this case, the Fed and the gaggle of bastard banker children eating at the trough gobbled
[44:09.840 --> 44:13.760]  up the five trillion plus in taxpayer money and then figuratively stuck their middle finger up
[44:13.760 --> 44:17.760]  when questions were asked about where the money was going. Meanwhile, the bailout has had no
[44:17.760 --> 44:21.440]  effect whatsoever, increasing the severity of the financial downturn and allowing the
[44:21.440 --> 44:26.480]  seemingly to exploit the crisis as a pretext for centralizing control of the world economic system
[44:26.480 --> 44:30.400]  and creating a new world order and a single global currency. Everything they've announced,
[44:30.400 --> 44:34.880]  everything we have said they would do, they're now doing, open discussion of martial law,
[44:34.880 --> 44:40.960]  open army brigades on the streets of America, open federal random checkpoints, open FEMA camps
[44:40.960 --> 44:48.960]  being built, world banks openly about to set up a world tax with Barack Obama leading it worldwide
[44:48.960 --> 44:56.240]  to regulate in tax, plastic bags, light bulbs, fuel, natural gas, oil, all its derivatives,
[44:56.240 --> 45:01.440]  all of its, all the things that come out of it, every type of factory, every type of industry.
[45:04.640 --> 45:08.400]  But only in the target nations that are targeted to be brought down financially,
[45:08.400 --> 45:12.400]  only in Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, England, Ireland,
[45:14.000 --> 45:21.520]  only in the first world nations, only in Japan, not in China, not in India, not in Mexico,
[45:21.520 --> 45:29.200]  not in Brazil, not in Paraguay, not in the Caribbean, not in Asia, not in South Korea,
[45:30.960 --> 45:33.840]  which is first world, more advanced than we are in a lot of respects.
[45:35.120 --> 45:39.600]  They are racing to take everything over, everything.
[45:43.040 --> 45:47.600]  And so all the remaining industry will flee the United States under the carbon taxes.
[45:47.600 --> 45:52.320]  You thought you didn't have job and all these blue collar people who were so simply fooled
[45:52.960 --> 45:56.880]  and all these white collar yuppies who were so easily fooled, they hate George Bush,
[45:56.880 --> 46:01.360]  they feel trendy, they're against torture, they're against phony wars, they're against executive,
[46:01.360 --> 46:08.080]  hubris. And so because George Bush on the surface, he signed back on to UNESCO four years ago,
[46:09.200 --> 46:12.880]  because George Bush on the surface said he was against the global carbon tax,
[46:12.880 --> 46:18.720]  the whole world and the middle classes of the world piled on and said, well,
[46:18.720 --> 46:23.360]  if that idiot is against it, it must be real and I'm going to rebel against George Bush.
[46:23.360 --> 46:30.560]  I'm going to show him, I'm going to get him. And you're going to really get him by paying
[46:31.280 --> 46:33.760]  your tax into the county and the city that will collect it.
[46:34.560 --> 46:38.080]  And about 10%, they're arguing about the models will be shared locally.
[46:38.080 --> 46:43.760]  Then the 90% will be sent on to the state, they'll keep another 10%, then it'll be sent
[46:43.760 --> 46:50.240]  on to the Feds, they'll keep 30, 40% and then about half of it will be given to the private
[46:50.240 --> 46:54.240]  central bankers who you will buy the carbon credits and cap and craze.
[46:54.240 --> 47:10.240]  Okay. World Bank, the club of Rome, the CFR admit it's all fake. They laugh at you in public
[47:10.240 --> 47:16.480]  publications. Open. We post them, we write about them, we make films about it.
[47:17.600 --> 47:19.840]  Meanwhile, they are butchering the real environment,
[47:19.840 --> 47:25.840]  just doing things that are probably irrevocable. Just God help us with the genetic engineering
[47:25.840 --> 47:30.160]  and the rest of it and the toxic waste and all of it. I mean, there's a lot of serious issues
[47:30.160 --> 47:34.720]  and there is a lot of toxic waste associated with petrochemicals. Don't get me wrong.
[47:35.520 --> 47:39.600]  And they have suppressed real technologies. But see, they trick you. They say, oh yeah,
[47:39.600 --> 47:43.840]  we're going to have new technologies. Oh yeah, we're going to move forward. We're going to,
[47:43.840 --> 47:49.600]  this is going to start a lot of new business and industry. Meanwhile, they're suppressing all of
[47:49.600 --> 47:54.800]  that. All they're going to do is slap a tax on everything, folks. Because to start these clean
[47:54.800 --> 48:03.120]  burning industries, to start these less toxic industries, it will take carbon to get those
[48:03.120 --> 48:07.680]  going and they have carbon involved and then they can always set the tax on whatever they want
[48:07.680 --> 48:11.920]  on anything that has carbon in it, including what you exhale and what you eat and everything.
[48:11.920 --> 48:15.760]  And they're talking about taxes on all meat, already starting in England.
[48:15.760 --> 48:20.240]  They're already telling restaurants, hey, you have to serve what we say on your menus.
[48:20.800 --> 48:27.600]  They're already CPSing the fat children. They don't care about your health. They know Americans
[48:27.600 --> 48:31.440]  are basically eating the same amount of food we ate 30, 40 years ago. In fact, a lot of it was more
[48:31.440 --> 48:38.240]  unhealthy then. They know full well the sodium fluoride lowers your thyroid output. They know
[48:38.240 --> 48:43.360]  full well that high levels of estrogen mimicking chemicals cause people to be obese and get diabetes.
[48:43.360 --> 48:48.080]  They know all that. They're not stupid. That's why they had hundreds of different types of plastics
[48:48.640 --> 48:53.360]  and they made sure the only one that got approved was the type that led off this deadly
[48:54.880 --> 49:00.960]  estrogen mimicking chemical. They're cold-blooded, ladies and gentlemen, and the sooner you come
[49:00.960 --> 49:05.760]  to grips that we have a scientific dictatorship. I mean, they got their stuff together. They
[49:05.760 --> 49:11.440]  designed the microchips. They designed the networks. They decide what colors the road signs are.
[49:11.440 --> 49:16.000]  They engineer the society. And just because you're not on the ball or you're not focused or you're
[49:16.000 --> 49:22.320]  not informed, doesn't mean there aren't people who aren't. They are. They run the world. And until
[49:22.320 --> 49:26.080]  we can recognize they run the world and they're taking us in a bad direction, it's only going
[49:26.080 --> 49:28.640]  to get worse. So I want to say it again, we're going to come back and take calls.
[49:28.640 --> 49:34.240]  We have a global elite
[49:36.960 --> 49:42.400]  that has set up police state systems so that their corporate governments can turn
[49:43.440 --> 49:47.760]  our original governments, the people's governments, into ceremonial institutions.
[49:48.640 --> 49:54.400]  They are setting up carbon taxes to feudalize the middle class and bring us to our knees
[49:54.400 --> 50:00.240]  like other third-world slaves. And they are stealing our entire future birthright and putting us into
[50:00.240 --> 50:05.360]  debt by design in the name of saving us while publicly laughing. I am so frustrated. I can't
[50:05.360 --> 50:11.200]  seem to remember anything anymore. What? Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible. I read
[50:11.200 --> 50:15.440]  something and forget. I forget people's names. I hear all this great information on the radio
[50:15.440 --> 50:20.880]  and I want to tell people, but I forget. Okay, slow down. Poor attention and memory loss is not
[50:20.880 --> 50:25.920]  your fault. Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum and deodorants, genetically modified
[50:25.920 --> 50:30.800]  foods the way the education system taught you. It's all meant to dumb you down. You know, I can
[50:30.800 --> 50:36.160]  remember everything now, even entire books. What? How? There is this website called School of
[50:36.160 --> 50:41.120]  Phenomenal Memory. Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[50:41.120 --> 50:46.480]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information,
[50:46.480 --> 50:53.280]  including entire books after they complete just 60 lessons. And they offer a no-questions-asked,
[50:53.280 --> 50:59.280]  no-time-limit, money-back guarantee. Wow. What's the website? Now, don't forget. It's
[50:59.280 --> 51:06.720]  pmemory.net, the letter P, memory.net. A day unlike any other in the long course of American
[51:06.720 --> 51:12.720]  history, a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th,
[51:12.720 --> 51:18.320]  but who is the enemy? bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to
[51:18.320 --> 51:23.760]  look to Osama bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[51:23.760 --> 51:28.640]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that
[51:28.640 --> 51:35.280]  there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some
[51:35.280 --> 51:40.720]  Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to
[51:40.720 --> 51:45.360]  the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war
[51:45.360 --> 51:51.440]  games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com,
[51:51.440 --> 51:56.800]  or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.

[53:28.080 --> 53:31.200]  All right, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls. I got a ton of other news. We're gonna go
[53:31.200 --> 53:38.640]  through what Obama is saying he's going to do, and it is bad. Chloe in Wisconsin, welcome.
[54:01.200 --> 54:16.560]  Well, so my heart is pretty full of that. But I'm calling regarding yesterday you were talking
[54:16.560 --> 54:27.280]  about ISP providers, Time Warner included, and I'm actually on a disability income myself. And
[54:27.280 --> 54:32.400]  this month I'm... I mean, I have to be there, have IT people look at it. I mean, there's a lot of
[54:32.400 --> 54:40.720]  research that goes into this. The bigger issue is, you just read the contract very closely
[54:41.360 --> 54:48.160]  and make sure that that particular Time Warner cable system isn't censoring. They're testing it
[54:48.160 --> 54:54.400]  in Canada. They're testing it in parts of the US like Texas and New York and California that I've
[54:54.400 --> 55:04.480]  seen. And that's just one facet of the censorship. But it's not a good sign if you're surfing and
[55:04.480 --> 55:11.920]  you go to the wrong website. You put the address in wrong and you're suddenly on time work in
[55:11.920 --> 55:20.400]  California that I've seen. And that's just one facet of the censorship. But it's not a good
[55:20.400 --> 55:28.240]  sign if you're surfing and you go to the wrong website. You put the address in wrong and you're
[55:28.240 --> 55:34.000]  suddenly on Time Warner's error page. That means you're going through their grid. They're recording
[55:34.000 --> 55:39.360]  everything you're doing. That hasn't happened yet. And we were talking... You were talking yesterday
[55:39.360 --> 55:47.440]  about them putting on a cap on internet. If that happens, won't that happen for all of the internet
[55:47.440 --> 55:52.960]  companies? No, they're testing it out. They're creeping up with it. Just like they're doing
[55:52.960 --> 55:59.120]  with martial law or any issue. Now martial law is openly being announced. And people are saying it
[55:59.120 --> 56:04.880]  doesn't exist. It doesn't exist because there aren't paratroopers coming down their backyard.
[56:04.880 --> 56:09.120]  I mean, martial law is when private banks have hijacked you. They've had the military threat
[56:09.120 --> 56:14.240]  to take over Congress if they stand in the way. And the private banks are... They are going to come
[56:14.240 --> 56:19.360]  after the pension funds, the IRAs. The government is going to grab those just like Argentina.
[56:19.360 --> 56:22.720]  And yes, it's to protect them. I mean, of course, they're not going to say,
[56:23.360 --> 56:29.280]  we're stealing it. No, it's, oh, we're protecting it. So, I mean, it's just unbelievable. So,
[56:29.280 --> 56:35.280]  there's just so much happening. So practically speaking, though, what would you think about
[56:35.280 --> 56:40.560]  as far as... I mean, most of these companies, they want you to get in on a year or two year
[56:40.560 --> 56:46.000]  contract to get... To set your money, your monthly... Yeah, but here's the deal. You have to read the
[56:46.000 --> 56:51.200]  contract. You have to cross outlines of it and say that if you cut back on my service,
[56:51.200 --> 56:55.840]  then you can threaten them and get out of the contract. Okay. I mean, here's the deal.
[56:56.400 --> 57:01.040]  Any talk show host that will just give you advice not knowing all your particulars
[57:01.040 --> 57:04.560]  is just acting like they know what they're talking about. No, I don't want you to throw
[57:04.560 --> 57:13.360]  these. I don't know who you've basically got. I don't know any of that. And so, I can't really
[57:13.360 --> 57:19.840]  give you... They're putting on a cap on internet. If that happens, won't that happen?
[57:20.720 --> 57:24.560]  The way they've now openly announced the last week, they are going to come out with the pension
[57:24.560 --> 57:29.760]  funds, the IRAs. The government is going to grab those just like Argentina. And yes,
[57:29.760 --> 57:34.080]  it's to protect them. I mean, of course, they're not going to say, we're stealing it.
[57:34.080 --> 57:39.680]  No, it's all we're protecting your particulars is just acting like they know what they're talking
[57:39.680 --> 57:47.040]  about. No, I don't know the companies. I don't know who you've... But that's only one facet of.
[57:47.040 --> 57:51.680]  So, it's going to be a process. What you should do is call your state legislators,
[57:51.680 --> 57:57.760]  call the cable company, call the ISP, tell them, don't restrict my content or I will cancel you.
[57:57.760 --> 58:08.160]  Political pressure is what's needed. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:11.200 --> 58:17.040]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[58:17.040 --> 58:23.120]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[58:23.120 --> 58:31.280]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story. Whitman, EPA director on the
[58:31.280 --> 58:38.080]  18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum
[58:38.080 --> 58:43.360]  of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.

[59:34.480 --> 59:41.680]  Got a guest joining us to talk about the
[59:44.400 --> 59:53.440]  once United States of America now a corporate, I guess, rape doll or something being used by
[59:53.440 --> 59:58.000]  the New World Order, bringing in their surveillance satellites to spy on the American people.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:07.840]  We are taking your phone calls right now. Let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[1:00:09.680 --> 1:00:12.240]  Let's talk to Aaron in Washington. You're on the air, Aaron.
[1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:18.480]  Hi, Alex. Hi. Hey, first time caller. You're doing an awesome job. Keep it up. Listen,
[1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:23.600]  I've got some news for you. Check this out. I'm watching the news. Washington, a place called
[1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:29.680]  Newcastle Little Town. They're having civilians. They've been given radar guns to civilians
[1:00:29.680 --> 1:00:34.240]  on doing speed traps down there. Well, I know they're doing that nationwide. Those are usually
[1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:39.280]  federal grants, just like cops taking blood without warrants as a federal grant and cops
[1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:43.920]  practicing taking over schools unannounced while kids are in them. The cops don't think,
[1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:49.360]  man, that traumatizes them. But the feds do. It's part of literally turning America into a giant
[1:00:49.360 --> 1:00:58.400]  reeducation camp. And yeah, it's about getting the citizens into the Tattletale squads. And they're
[1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:05.120]  not even being paid. It's just the power trip. And then see, first they get trained on. Oh yeah,
[1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:09.600]  it's crazy. Well, I'm just going to say, and then I'm going to let you just go ahead and add your
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:14.720]  point. Oh, I was going to say, they show this picture of a lady and she just has this look on
[1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:19.520]  her face of, I'm going to get you. And she's got this radar gun in her hand and they did this small
[1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:24.720]  little piece and you can go on to the local news here in Washington, you know, King five and read
[1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:30.320]  it. And I think anyone who's not, you know, freaked out of their mind and like angry about them doing
[1:01:30.320 --> 1:01:35.040]  that has really got to think twice because if they're giving them radar guns, what's next? They're
[1:01:35.040 --> 1:01:40.320]  going to give them a gun. They're going to give, you know what I mean? Last night, I can't remember
[1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:48.880]  the exact headline. It's Newcastle, Washington. It's like a king five.com. It was like a small
[1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:54.000]  puff piece. I know, but see, it's probably moved off the page now. Yeah, I, you know, your, your
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:59.040]  website, I sent it in and I left the link on your website, you know, on your, you know, with the
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:07.200]  news tips. Yes, sir. So it's there. But yeah, it's just it freaks you out. Yeah, I know it's,
[1:02:07.200 --> 1:02:12.080]  it's, it's really bad. Well, I've noticed that that's, you know, that's one way to get the
[1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:16.240]  initial people involved in that stuff is making it sound like, Hey, you're doing the community of
[1:02:16.240 --> 1:02:20.560]  service. You're helping out, you know, you're trying to catch, you know, people that are speeding.
[1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:24.960]  I guess the people that, you know, the civilians that catch these speeders write down all their
[1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:30.640]  information. Remember the cops are civilians too, but under martial law, you have mayors and governors
[1:02:30.640 --> 1:02:35.200]  calling the citizens civilians. Well, they are too, unless you're under martial law. So there's a
[1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:41.600]  reason they've been instructed to teach us that we're civil. Well, I've noticed that that's,
[1:02:41.600 --> 1:02:45.840]  you know, that's one way to get the initial people involved in that stuff is making it sound like,
[1:02:45.840 --> 1:02:50.240]  Hey, you're doing the community of service. You're helping out, you know, you're trying to catch,
[1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:53.520]  you know, people that are speeding. I guess the people that, you know, the civilians that
[1:02:53.520 --> 1:02:58.400]  catch these speeders write down all their information. Remember the cops are civilians too,
[1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:03.280]  but under martial law, you have mayors and governors calling the citizens civilians. Well,
[1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:08.240]  they are too, unless you're under martial law, bridges and power plants and schools.
[1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:12.880]  And then they had FBI training seminars all over the country. And it's been in the news,
[1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:17.760]  you go to those meetings, the press goes to those and they say, okay, we're gonna spend an hour on
[1:03:17.760 --> 1:03:23.200]  Al Qaeda, but now we're going to spend the next two nights of the two day course on marijuana in
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:29.200]  your neighbor's yard. And is your neighbor spanking their child? And here's the 311 tattletail number.
[1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:34.480]  And listen to what your neighbor's doing. You know, don't trust you. And by the way,
[1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:39.200]  don't profile. Don't trust anyone, especially white males. There's thousands of them.
[1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:47.040]  The initial people involved in that stuff is making it sound like, Hey,
[1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:51.200]  you're doing the community of service. You're helping out, you know, you're trying to catch,
[1:03:51.200 --> 1:03:54.800]  you know, people that are speeding. I guess the people that, you know, the civilians that catch
[1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:59.920]  these speeders write down all their information. Remember, the cops are civilians too, but under
[1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:05.360]  martial law, you have mayors and governors calling the citizens civilians. Well, they are too,
[1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:09.120]  unless you're under martial law. So there's a reason they've been instructed
[1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:15.280]  to teach us that we're civilians. And that means slave. Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've
[1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:19.440]  told you for a long time, it's important to be self sufficient. And today that's more important
[1:04:19.440 --> 1:04:23.920]  than ever. We need to be independent and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in
[1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:28.240]  a bread line if you have your own bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for
[1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:33.200]  FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency. If you simply prepare our elective representatives
[1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:37.600]  wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest. So they ignored your screams, not to do
[1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:43.280]  it. They turned off the telephones and email they voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin
[1:04:43.280 --> 1:04:48.880]  air. This money now owns the American and European banks. The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:53.760]  will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of massacres, particularly food,
[1:04:53.760 --> 1:04:58.960]  beyond many Americans reach in pre Nazi Germany, super inflation, the cost of a loaf of bread
[1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:04.480]  doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks. Food prices are skyrocketing so
[1:05:04.480 --> 1:05:09.440]  fast. There seems as if there may be no end in sight. The private banks merging with our government
[1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:13.760]  are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves. The stores have less
[1:05:13.760 --> 1:05:18.720]  food but jack up prices to stay in business. Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared
[1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:23.040]  and be ready. Everything is zeroing in on food. One third of Americans have to choose between
[1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:27.760]  buying food and paying for other necessities. My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared,
[1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:31.760]  get self sufficient, get food. For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you
[1:05:31.760 --> 1:05:35.840]  to understand that by having a supply of storeable food, the government, the new old order has a lot
[1:05:35.840 --> 1:05:40.880]  less control over you. And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self sufficiency and preparedness.
[1:05:40.880 --> 1:05:44.480]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you. You know,
[1:05:44.480 --> 1:05:49.120]  eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella,
[1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:53.520]  Genetic Alteration or Chinese Imports and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's

[1:06:30.960 --> 1:06:38.320]  Alice Lipovic is our guest for the next 20 minutes or so and she writes for Federal Computer
[1:06:38.320 --> 1:06:46.400]  Week. She's been reporting for four plus years there on Homeland Security itself and I-
[1:06:46.400 --> 1:06:47.440]  Well, the name of the office.
[1:06:48.720 --> 1:06:53.280]  Spy on farmers and people building houses or new barns when they're not supposed to.
[1:06:53.280 --> 1:06:56.880]  But in the last year, I've seen reports about the plan for Homeland Security to use this
[1:06:56.880 --> 1:07:04.000]  domestically and to give local police access to it. So, Alice, we appreciate you coming on with us.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:10.240]  Thanks for joining us. Thank you. What do we know about this? When did you first learn about it?
[1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:17.120]  How advanced is this project? Well, the name of the office is the National
[1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:25.280]  Applications Office and this has been controversial ever since it came out. I would say that it
[1:07:25.280 --> 1:07:30.240]  became publicly known through the Homeland Security Committee and the House of Representatives.
[1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:37.680]  The chairman of that committee, Congressman Thompson from Mississippi last July, held a meeting and
[1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:43.280]  issued a letter saying that he had first learned of that program and was very surprised to learn of
[1:07:43.280 --> 1:07:48.800]  that program and was disappointed to learn about those plans at that time because he had not been
[1:07:48.800 --> 1:07:54.400]  informed in advance and certainly many members of Congress have raised concerns about that.
[1:07:54.400 --> 1:08:02.400]  And getting to the point, there are some proposals on the table to use those satellites,
[1:08:02.400 --> 1:08:10.000]  as you said, the Defense Military Satellites for domestic law enforcement. However, they may be
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:30.160]  used. How advanced is this project? Well, the name of the office is the National Applications
[1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:38.000]  Office and this has been controversial ever since it came out. I would say that it became
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:42.560]  publicly known through the Homeland Security Committee and the House of Representatives.
[1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:47.280]  The chairman of that committee, Congressman, that there are incidents of national significance
[1:08:47.280 --> 1:08:51.520]  that they may be used. PDD 51, basically anything the president wants to use it for.
[1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:55.680]  I'm sorry? Presidential Decision Directive 51.
[1:08:57.760 --> 1:09:02.160]  Okay, I'm not familiar with that. Well, just basically any emergency or any insurrection,
[1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:08.240]  any rioting, any natural disaster, the president claims the power to do anything he wants with
[1:09:08.240 --> 1:09:14.800]  these systems. Does this concern you having this huge military apparatus being swung around,
[1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:20.080]  aimed at the American people and that Congress didn't even know about it? Meanwhile, the Defense
[1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:26.320]  Department was already starting to reach out to local police. What about the National Reconnaissance
[1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:33.920]  Office? I was covering a governmental meeting up there a few months ago in Chantilly and I
[1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:37.520]  saw the National Reconnaissance Office. How do they tie into all this?
[1:09:39.120 --> 1:09:48.640]  The Congress, I believe, cut some of that funding and let me just review that. There was a Defense
[1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:54.880]  Department proposal, like you said, the National Reconnaissance Office. The plan was to launch
[1:09:54.880 --> 1:10:04.560]  an additional advanced satellite to the tune of 1.7 billion and the Congress decided last month to
[1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:11.360]  withhold that funding, apparently because I'm not sure exactly why they would tell the funding,
[1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:16.560]  but they decided not to put that in the package. Now, some of the commercial firms are saying
[1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:22.400]  that's actually not needed because they are able to provide satellite imagery when needed.
[1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:28.800]  But again, we will wait and see what happens with that program. It would have increased the
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:35.280]  capabilities of that office to collect imagery. Can you speak to the power of these satellites?
[1:10:35.280 --> 1:10:41.520]  I know on a clear day they could read the year date on a dime laying on the cement or could read
[1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:48.080]  the text of a book, the famous 1965 photo of the man in Central Park reading a book and you can
[1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:55.600]  read the text, the small fine print in the paperback. I know that they admit they've got stuff that
[1:10:56.880 --> 1:11:04.000]  can literally see through walls, but they won't declassify the exact level of technology.
[1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:10.800]  Can you comment to that? Yeah, I really can't confirm what you're saying. A lot of that information
[1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:19.760]  is classified and I can't really confirm those kind of details. I mean, I can tell you that
[1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:25.680]  Charles Allen, the Undersecretary for Intelligence and Analysis, gave a speech at the GeoInk
[1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:31.760]  conference last month and he talked about in broad terms geospatial information technology
[1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:37.280]  becoming a lot more important in the Department of Homeland Security. The use of that technology
[1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:42.720]  growing at an accelerating rate and they were using it not only in larger quantities,
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:48.480]  but in greater scope throughout more programs. So we're really talking about a huge infusion
[1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:53.280]  of geospatial information. Now some of that information is just what you're going to get
[1:11:53.280 --> 1:11:58.800]  from Google Earth. So I wouldn't put it in the category of spy satellite information.
[1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:03.600]  And by the way, police are already using that. The Google Earth is available. Yes,
[1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:08.000]  those kind of capabilities are available publicly. You can get them on the internet.
[1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:14.880]  Those are widespread. The federal government at this time is putting together a package to
[1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:19.440]  make those even more available to federal agencies. We're talking about agriculture,
[1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:25.680]  energy, the EPA. Those agencies are heavily involved in using the geospatial information.
[1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:32.160]  Now Mr. Allen at the Homeland Security said that by the end of this year, they are deploying
[1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:38.400]  a tool, a geospatial tool, and he described it as a Google Earth feel. So I'm taking that to mean
[1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:43.120]  that it's like Google Earth, but not exactly Google Earth. It is probably a proprietary
[1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:46.320]  product that has been specially developed for the department.
[1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:50.480]  What it is is the Google Earth system they gave Google.
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:55.840]  That's what I've been told by people inside MIT.
[1:12:55.840 --> 1:13:04.720]  Okay, whatever. Again, he referred to it as a Google Earth feel. They are deploying these
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:09.760]  kinds of tools. Again, that's quite different from a spy satellite we're not talking about.
[1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:15.360]  I understand. With the spy satellites, what were they proposing in different programs to use these
[1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:19.360]  in? The spy satellite? Yeah, you were saying it was a wide area.
[1:13:20.960 --> 1:13:25.200]  What they have talked about with the National Applications Office, I believe right now,
[1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:32.320]  is limited to disaster relief and civil applications only and not law enforcement functions.
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:37.360]  So that is what they have talked about at the moment. But they had proposed it for law enforcement,
[1:13:37.360 --> 1:13:45.040]  but now they've withdrawn that? I'm not sure I can confirm exactly which document there has been.
[1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:50.000]  I believe, yes, there was some talk of having it for law enforcement. I'm not sure if it was
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:55.920]  documented. Some of that could be classified information. Sure. Have you seen the reports
[1:13:55.920 --> 1:14:04.640]  though tied into this? The use of drones, pilotless aircraft? Which report are you talking about?
[1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:08.480]  Oh, there have been a whole bunch where they've been also the military has been
[1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:13.760]  using drones during emergencies and different events and then feeding that back and sharing it
[1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:21.280]  with the locals. No, I haven't seen those. Sorry. No, no, that's fine. I just wanted to see if
[1:14:21.280 --> 1:14:24.720]  you had seen those because I can, I've actually got it here in my stacks and maybe I'll pull that
[1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:29.040]  out and read your line. I believe there was some testing done for drones in the Texas area.
[1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:35.520]  Yeah, Houston and other places. Why hadn't Congress heard about this? That's strange.
[1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:42.400]  About the National Applications Office? Yes. Well, I mean about the Pentagon wanting to launch
[1:14:42.400 --> 1:14:51.040]  a satellite just for good old USA. I don't know. I don't know what program you're talking about.
[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:54.880]  The National Reconnaissance Office or the National Applications Office?
[1:14:54.880 --> 1:14:58.880]  The National Reconnaissance Office. What you talked about earlier with, yeah.
[1:14:58.880 --> 1:15:04.480]  The Congress did, they did withhold that funding. So apparently there was some
[1:15:04.480 --> 1:15:10.880]  problem. They did not approve of that program. I don't know exactly what reason was given.
[1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:13.840]  It was part of the spending bill. They did not fund that program.
[1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:19.520]  So it's possible they will fund it in the future, but right now I don't have any more details.
[1:15:19.520 --> 1:15:22.720]  You were telling me there's been a lot of interest in this. We've seen a lot of
[1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:26.800]  interest in it. That's why we got you on. And I know neither one of us have too much
[1:15:26.800 --> 1:15:31.840]  information because they are keeping it close to the vest. I mean, is that fair to say?
[1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:37.440]  I would say it's been hard to get definite information on this program. Yes.
[1:15:37.440 --> 1:15:45.440]  Mr. Allen made the speech and he revealed that for the first time the Customs and Border Protection
[1:15:45.440 --> 1:15:52.240]  flew the Predator B to support FEMA for the relief efforts for the hurricanes this last
[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:58.320]  season, including Hurricane Ike. So the information is coming out in drips and drabs,
[1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:02.720]  but we're not getting lots of information on this. Some of it is sensitive and some of it is
[1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:08.480]  classified information. How does Northcom tie into all of this?
[1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:21.200]  Well, as you know, Northcom is the North American command in Fort Peterson in Colorado,
[1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:25.600]  and they have the responsibility of being the Homeland Security Command.
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:35.200]  They recently announced that they do have assets at their disposal, and what we're talking about
[1:16:35.200 --> 1:16:42.160]  is assets. They have personnel and they have units at their disposal now for Homeland Security,
[1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:46.800]  and these are military units that are stationed around the country. I believe it amounts to
[1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:54.160]  about 4,000 personnel, and that announcement was made about a month ago. So again, that unit has
[1:16:54.160 --> 1:17:00.800]  been around since 2002. It has now, for the first time, have dedicated personnel to it,
[1:17:01.600 --> 1:17:09.680]  so that is a growing command with a presence. Did you hear about the plan to use an Army brigade
[1:17:09.680 --> 1:17:14.000]  attached to it, and then the Air Force announced last week they're going to add their own brigades
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:20.640]  to a domestic... No, I don't know anything about that. Well, I tell you, that is interesting,
[1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:24.320]  though, to have all this military hardware being focused in on the United States.
[1:17:26.400 --> 1:17:28.080]  Yeah, again, I don't know anything about that.
[1:17:30.320 --> 1:17:35.120]  Yeah, you specifically just focused in on... I mostly look at geospatial
[1:17:35.120 --> 1:17:42.320]  intelligence at the department. Well, that's amazing. Look, Alice, we've got a break. She's
[1:17:42.320 --> 1:17:45.760]  with the Federal Computer Week for just a few minutes. I want to come back to five more minutes
[1:17:45.760 --> 1:17:50.800]  with you if you can do that. Is that okay? Alice, are we off the line? No, no, no. We're still on
[1:17:50.800 --> 1:18:16.800]  air. Hold on. I'm going to go to break right now and I'll talk to you off air. Stay with us.
[1:18:50.800 --> 1:19:20.160]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree executive order
[1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:25.840]  11,110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend
[1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:30.160]  money to the United States government and interest. With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put
[1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:34.640]  the Fed out of business. The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[1:19:34.640 --> 1:19:40.560]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed. Midas has the Kennedy versus Fed document,

[1:22:02.560 --> 1:22:10.160]  The Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind. That's right, we're investigating.
[1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:18.320]  Kind of like a pink panther with a deaf skill. I'm joking about myself. The spy satellites that
[1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:23.360]  the Pentagon and others have wanted to turn inward and share with local police, and we're talking to
[1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:32.240]  federal computer weeks reporter on this, Alice Lipovitch, and we appreciate her on with us
[1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:35.760]  for a few more minutes. Coming up your phone calls in the next segment on the economy,
[1:22:35.760 --> 1:22:43.120]  Barack Obama presidency, and a lot more. I see a paragraph here in your article, Alice, where
[1:22:44.720 --> 1:22:50.400]  it says, Alan recommended diversity, availability, survivability, and flexibility for the future
[1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:56.240]  systems in a satellite and modular payload system, similar to what was advised by the
[1:22:56.240 --> 1:23:02.080]  Marino report in July 2007, the director of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and the
[1:23:02.080 --> 1:23:08.320]  National Reconnaissance Office. So are they talking about a new system of satellites
[1:23:09.760 --> 1:23:14.240]  just for domestic uses, or is this part of a broader plan?
[1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:20.640]  I believe this is a part of a broader plan, and they are talking about future satellite
[1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:28.720]  imagery capabilities, and Mr. Alan was outlining what the need for, as you said, diversity,
[1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:34.320]  availability, survivability, flexibility, and it gives them the greatest ability to
[1:23:35.760 --> 1:23:41.840]  create individual satellite projects and have individual tailored
[1:23:42.560 --> 1:23:50.480]  collections of imagery for those projects. Again, it doesn't really relate to, specifically,
[1:23:50.480 --> 1:23:55.680]  what the uses of that will be. It just gives them the breath and the depth that they're hoping for.
[1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:00.320]  I just want to point out, Alex, that I'm looking right at the Department of Homeland Security
[1:24:00.320 --> 1:24:04.560]  website here, and they do have a fact sheet for the National Applications Office,
[1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:10.160]  and it does spell out, specifically, this has been not a secret that they do intend to use
[1:24:10.160 --> 1:24:16.560]  this for law enforcement, and the American Civil Liberties Union has been saying repeatedly
[1:24:16.560 --> 1:24:22.000]  that there are civil liberties and privacy concerns that would need to be addressed with that,
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:28.640]  and they've asked for a moratorium on that until those concerns can be vetted and addressed,
[1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:32.160]  and Congress did not provide the funding for the law enforcement uses
[1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:38.080]  in the appropriations bill. However, they are supposed to be moving forward with
[1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:44.320]  some civilian uses of that, and we're still trying to get details on exactly what those uses will be.
[1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:48.080]  We know that they will include disaster management and recovery uses.
[1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:51.920]  In addition to that, we're still looking into that.
[1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:57.920]  The feedback you're getting, I mean, most people that are writing us are dreading this.
[1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:00.960]  You know, they say this sounds like Big Brother having Pentagon satellites
[1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:05.760]  floating overhead in space, and tethered blimps, and all these other things they're calling for,
[1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:10.000]  and drones buzzing around. They say that sounds like Big Brother. What's the feedback you're
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:15.840]  getting, Alice? We've certainly heard concerns like that. Certainly the ACLU, as I mentioned,
[1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:22.960]  has been talking about privacy. There has been a concern in Congress about privacy.
[1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:28.400]  We expect those concerns to increase now that we have a new administration,
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:33.440]  Democratic administration, along with Democratic majority in Congress.
[1:25:34.320 --> 1:25:39.920]  I expect that more information possibly could be aired about this program before it gets
[1:25:39.920 --> 1:25:47.040]  off the ground. Well, Alice, you know, the feds paid with grant money to put in the national
[1:25:47.040 --> 1:25:51.040]  traffic camera system, and that goes into the Department of Transportation.
[1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:56.960]  And then they just mainlined its use by having local police departments, local news agencies,
[1:25:56.960 --> 1:26:00.960]  dialing in the public and dial in online, and look at those surveillance systems. But
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:04.400]  now they're saying, oh, guess what? We're going to use it to surveil you individually
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:09.360]  for law enforcement. And it looks like that it's the same thing here. They're just going to say,
[1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:15.280]  okay, you can use the high tech satellites and just kind of mainline this Big Brother system.
[1:26:15.280 --> 1:26:19.840]  And that really concerns me. So we're glad that you're there at Federal Computer Week
[1:26:21.440 --> 1:26:27.440]  reporting on what's being done with these different Pentagon and, you know, NSA and
[1:26:27.440 --> 1:26:32.480]  surveillance type agencies. I mean, the American people know the Pentagon's been watching us for
[1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:38.480]  a while. And we know they're just mainlining this use against us now. And I'm glad that the
[1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:42.960]  American Civil Liberties Union and others are concerned about it. And we appreciate you taking
[1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:49.040]  time out to join us. People can go to fcw.com to read your columns and other columns. Thanks
[1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:54.400]  for coming on with us. Thank you. You bet. Take care. Yeah, I mean, you know, we're going to try
[1:26:54.400 --> 1:27:02.400]  to bring you lots of guests from mainstream media who are reporting on this. I tell the public that
[1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:07.840]  they're using spy satellites to watch you and that this is already going on and people don't
[1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:12.560]  believe it. I remember telling people when I read the Telecommunications Act in 96 that
[1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:18.560]  they were going to share the cell phone data where you are, what you're doing, your location
[1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:27.920]  with local police and people couldn't believe me. Then the governor of Wisconsin came out and
[1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:32.240]  talked about it in the news. He later got slapped down. He wasn't supposed to warn the slaves,
[1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:38.960]  but these police emergency centers are really federal and they can punch up where you are,
[1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:43.040]  what you're doing, dial in and listen to you. I mean, it's just total big brother.
[1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:48.000]  Now they're just getting ready to introduce this to all the slaves. This is in place.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:54.720]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[1:31:38.160 --> 1:31:45.360]  sucked out by the bankers and a lot more today. Right now, let's go to Bill NPA. Bill,
[1:31:45.360 --> 1:31:51.920]  you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Hello? Yes, sir. Alex Jones, you're my favorite.
[1:31:51.920 --> 1:31:58.800]  I'm a huge fan of yours. Well, I appreciate that. I'm not my favorite person. Well,
[1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:05.200]  you're my favorite person anyway. Anyway, the question I wanted to ask you, and I can't think
[1:32:05.200 --> 1:32:13.760]  of anybody else who could possibly answer this, in Barack Obama's acceptance speech,
[1:32:13.760 --> 1:32:25.360]  you said, you know, I'm going to cut this to the important word. You mean victory speech?
[1:32:25.360 --> 1:32:31.920]  Yeah. What did I say? Well, I mean, you said acceptance of the nomination or victory speech.
[1:32:31.920 --> 1:32:35.040]  I'm sorry. No, no, I'm just trying to find out what speech you're talking about. Go ahead.
[1:32:35.040 --> 1:32:48.320]  Well, at midnight on Tuesday, he said, the only way it's been done in this country for
[1:32:48.320 --> 1:32:57.600]  221 years, that's what he said. Now, if you take 2008 and subtract 221, you come up to 1787.
[1:32:57.600 --> 1:33:05.680]  Right? Yes. There's a lot of things that happened in 1787. What do you think he was referring to
[1:33:05.680 --> 1:33:15.440]  when he said that? Well, during that period of time is when they ratified the Bill of Rights
[1:33:15.440 --> 1:33:23.520]  and other things. So he was accurately giving the general timeframe of when the country was
[1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:30.400]  really officially born. Okay. Yeah, I understand. You know, you can argue whether it was 1776.
[1:33:30.400 --> 1:33:36.160]  Sure, certainly. You know, the Declaration of Independence on July 4th or whether it was other
[1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:45.920]  benchmarks. Yeah. No, I agree with you. I just, I don't have as much knowledge as you do. Oh,
[1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:50.400]  no, I don't have that much knowledge. I'm just trying to exactly understand the specifics of
[1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:57.440]  your question. Well, I'm just taking this as like an excerpt from his acceptance speech. Am I
[1:33:57.440 --> 1:34:05.200]  saying that right? Yes. Okay. From his acceptance speech, the only way it's been done, maybe this
[1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:11.360]  is not even context or whatever, but the only way it's been done in this country for 221 years,
[1:34:11.360 --> 1:34:22.240]  as if everyone knew what he was referring to. Okay. Listen, I appreciate your call. Basically,
[1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:32.800]  what's happening here is everybody is analyzing the most minute minutiae of everything Barack
[1:34:32.800 --> 1:34:38.320]  Obama says, everything Barack Obama does. And then Barack Obama, as he is meant to be
[1:34:38.320 --> 1:34:45.200]  by the social engineers, becomes a giant distraction away from the real government. Northcom.
[1:34:47.760 --> 1:34:58.880]  Northcom. It is Northcom empowered under federal law to arrest governors, take over cities,
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:08.080]  put American citizens into forced labor camps. Those are public executive orders.
[1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:16.560]  And how do we get the public to focus in on that instead of Barack Obama? Now,
[1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:21.120]  now understand, I'm spending a lot of time on Barack Obama too. I'm not criticizing anybody
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:26.080]  for bringing up Barack Obama. All I'm saying is if we bring him up, let's bring him up and point
[1:35:26.080 --> 1:35:30.480]  out the guys of puppet. Just like I've been saying for years, as much as I love George Bush,
[1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:37.120]  very dislikable person. That's why he was chosen. He was chosen so you would learn to hate him,
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:41.760]  so you would then accept your new savior, Barack Obama, who will put some different
[1:35:41.760 --> 1:35:46.400]  window dressing on things in a different style, but it'll be the same outcome.
[1:35:47.440 --> 1:35:52.320]  It's like basketball. Bush would put the ball in the hoop one way and Barack Obama would put it in
[1:35:52.320 --> 1:36:00.000]  there another way or fishing. George Bush would put the fly on the end of the string for flyfish
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:03.920]  in one way and Barack Obama does it another way, but they're still out there fly fishing.
[1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:09.920]  Barack Obama is worse on the bank or takeover if that is possible.
[1:36:11.200 --> 1:36:15.520]  And that's because of course they're going to choose somebody who is fully in bed
[1:36:15.520 --> 1:36:19.600]  with the private banks taking over. I mean, for those that don't know, have we lost all outrage?
[1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:27.760]  Mainstream news, Bloomberg, AP and others are reporting over two trillion, total over five
[1:36:27.760 --> 1:36:35.440]  trillion, but two trillion through the Federal Reserve alone of taxpayer money in the last month.
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:42.080]  And the Federal Reserve told Congress, we're not going to show it to you.
[1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:46.160]  And two weeks ago, the Treasury gave them the documents and they were all blacked out and
[1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:50.160]  they said national security, we don't have to tell you under that bill you passed.
[1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:58.960]  Well, Congress can't pass a bill saying that bank robbery is legal, you know, on December 25th,
[1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:05.040]  that you're allowed to go in with a shotgun and shoot people in a bank and rob the vault.
[1:37:05.840 --> 1:37:11.600]  Congress can't pass a law saying black people aren't human beings and have to all be put to death.
[1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:20.000]  It's unconstitutional, it's against your basic human rights. The Bill of Rights, the Constitution,
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:27.040]  only point out concrete organic rights that you had since the foundations of the world.
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:32.240]  But a lot of people in government get fooled by Hitler, by Stalin, by Mao,
[1:37:32.240 --> 1:37:37.280]  and they say, well, Kim Jong-il of Korea says, we're going to kill two million people this year
[1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:42.480]  in forced labor camps, he wants to reduce the number of people, and so he's the God Emperor,
[1:37:42.480 --> 1:37:48.400]  he's the little five-foot-two drug addict, and he says people are going to die and he's the law,
[1:37:49.760 --> 1:37:57.440]  and so they follow their orders. And so they can say that the presidency is above all law.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:01.600]  Nixon said he could break the law and you saw what happened to him, but that's when we had a
[1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:16.480]  Congress that wasn't completely gilded, neutered, castrated. So that's the problem with Barack
[1:38:16.480 --> 1:38:23.280]  Obama is that he's a giant publicity stunt by the New World Order. Well, everybody's got their
[1:38:23.280 --> 1:38:30.640]  mouths hanging open in a black president, but the novelty of it, I've been here for over a decade,
[1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:36.240]  13 years now telling you these presidents are puppets. It's the continuity of government,
[1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:42.160]  it's the shadow government, it's North com, it's the private global corporations that lobby the
[1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:47.680]  congresses and parliaments of the world, the legislatures, to sign their authority criminally
[1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:55.280]  over to multinational private institutions who then use the domestic militaries of those nations
[1:38:55.280 --> 1:39:02.320]  to carry out their tyranny. That's what we're talking about here today. All right, this is the
[1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:08.000]  name of the caller. It's Reptoid from Planet Pop-Tart. I told you you can use any name you want
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:14.320]  calling in, though I don't want to encourage plagiarism. That's my little joking term.
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:18.720]  I'm really a Reptoid from Planet Pop-Tart. Go ahead, Reptoid.
[1:39:18.720 --> 1:39:26.000]  Hey, Alex. I was just calling in a comment on the martial law. First, I'd like to say that
[1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:32.000]  martial law isn't really the ultimate tyranny. The ultimate tyranny is controlled by a psychological
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:37.760]  manipulation so that people don't even realize they're in a tyranny. I think that's more predominant
[1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:47.200]  of what's going on today. I agree. I mean, it's incremental. It's manipulating the terms we use.
[1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:55.520]  It's changing our values. It's making us believe we're free when we're not.
[1:39:56.720 --> 1:40:00.880]  It's training us that not having free speech rights or the right to assemble is freedom
[1:40:00.880 --> 1:40:06.960]  when it's not. People got to start seeing things for what they really are and not for what they
[1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:13.360]  appear to be. Everybody's caught up in an appear to be stage that the women, the men, the cars,
[1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:20.160]  what's on the television, tell them I see your vision. So they become victims of that,
[1:40:20.160 --> 1:40:25.120]  and they're stuck in that limitation now. Absolutely. They're in that controlled paradigm.
[1:40:25.840 --> 1:40:31.360]  It'd be like somebody living in a box locked up in it from birth thinking that that little box,
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:36.320]  the size of a small bathroom that they live in, is their whole world and thinking that food is
[1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:41.920]  just slid underneath the door every day. Yeah, exactly. That's their universe, and you try to
[1:40:41.920 --> 1:40:46.960]  tell them different. They don't believe you. Anything else? Yeah, talk about solutions.
[1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:53.200]  I got a solution right here. There's a United States government patent for the cure of AIDS
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:59.280]  that's been on the shelf for nine years, and I have all the, you can look it up online
[1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:06.800]  on the patent office online. I have the address here and the patent number. We've had the
[1:41:06.800 --> 1:41:12.400]  refurctor that brought all that on on. We've also had the researchers on where they admit
[1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:18.080]  that it was a bioengineered mycoplasm. Yeah. Back in the 70s, but go ahead and give the
[1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:40.800]  information out. All right. Well, the website is http front slash front slash p-a-t-f-t dot us-p-t-o dot gov front slash n-e-t-a-h-t-m-l front slash p-t-o front slash f-r-c-h-n-u-m dot htm.
[1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:45.760]  That'll take you to the search page on the patent office on the patent for the cure. The best thing
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:52.640]  to do is just type us patent office into Google. And then once you get there, you need to give the
[1:41:52.640 --> 1:41:58.480]  patent number into their search box. So that's what you do. And would you like to give them the patent
[1:41:58.480 --> 1:42:03.920]  number? Yeah, it's five, six, seven, six, nine, seven, seven. And there's also a patent for the
[1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:08.960]  actual virus itself. And that patent number is four, six, four, seven, seven, seven, three.
[1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:20.320]  Absolutely. Appreciate your call. By the way, later I'm going to play a clip. It's a compilation
[1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:25.040]  of clips of different doctors and scientists admitting that the government's known for a long
[1:42:25.040 --> 1:42:36.480]  time that mercury causes massive brain damage. And so what have they now done? They're going to,
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:45.200]  I have the article here in my stack, boost the amount of mercury by four times
[1:42:48.480 --> 1:42:54.640]  quote for people above 65. And they put out all these fake federal,
[1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:02.560]  federally funded and drug company funded studies saying how great it is.
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:06.560]  By the way, I meant to send it to you, John. I forgot it's up on prisonplanet.com and the news
[1:43:06.560 --> 1:43:13.520]  archive is from last night. We go grab the clip where they talk about putting statin drugs in
[1:43:13.520 --> 1:43:19.680]  the water supply. See, now they're saying even low or normal cholesterol is bad. Cholesterol is
[1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:23.520]  bad period and causes heart attacks. So you've got to take the statin drugs. It doesn't matter
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:27.920]  if hundreds of studies have been coming out the last few years that statins actually kill you
[1:43:27.920 --> 1:43:33.680]  and that it isn't cholesterol that's bad and that it attacks your liver. They don't care.
[1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:39.840]  They'll just have a, and they even admit they say, oh, the drug company's paid. The maker of
[1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:45.200]  the statin paid for this study. But it doesn't matter. We need to put it in the water supply
[1:43:45.760 --> 1:43:48.800]  and they propose putting it in the water supply on MSNBC.
[1:43:50.960 --> 1:43:55.680]  That a bunch of other clips coming up too. Let's talk to Charles in California. Go ahead,
[1:43:55.680 --> 1:44:02.080]  Charles. Hey man, this stuff is totally out of control. It's like the stuff that I've heard
[1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:06.720]  you say two, three years ago even. It was just retardedly insane. Like that, you know, I just
[1:44:06.720 --> 1:44:10.800]  love to believe you're a lunatic from reptoid or whatever, reptoid from planet pop star.
[1:44:11.440 --> 1:44:17.760]  But yeah, it's all making sense now. And like I said, I'm a Syrian Jew when I've called before
[1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:22.560]  and I come from New Jersey and New York and I'm trying to wake these people up. So my point is
[1:44:22.560 --> 1:44:26.560]  we know that they want to, I'm not trying to just jump on the, you know, they're only at the Jewish
[1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:31.600]  train, but we know that they protect, they do everything in the name of protecting Israel to
[1:44:32.320 --> 1:44:37.760]  to get, you know, go after every war they want to do and also. Just like they claim Bush is a
[1:44:37.760 --> 1:44:44.480]  Christian though, there's a larger agenda there. Right. So now my question is we know they like
[1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:49.280]  to exterminate Jews. We know they did it in the Holocaust. We also know that they were going to
[1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:55.440]  try to assassinate FDR and install the same type of thing here in the 30s. Right. So my question
[1:44:55.440 --> 1:45:00.480]  is, yeah, I covered that in the end game. Go ahead. Right. Of course. That's my source for it.
[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:06.960]  Um, what do you think, uh, what, what is, like, what are their plans? Are they going to do this
[1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:09.920]  again? Do you think they're going to exterminate tons of Jews again? Do you think they're going
[1:45:09.920 --> 1:45:15.520]  to like go after the Jews? Well, this is why the Nazis get mad at me because
[1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:21.600]  uh, they feel real self-righteous and they see all these Israeli operatives in the White House.
[1:45:22.480 --> 1:45:27.600]  No matter what administration it is, and they say, see, it's all a Jewish conspiracy.
[1:45:28.640 --> 1:45:32.480]  But then if you look deeper into it and you find out who really owns a lot of the big banks,
[1:45:32.480 --> 1:45:38.080]  who the Rothschilds are married into the, the, uh, you know, uh, literal German royalty of,
[1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:43.120]  of England, you find out there's an agenda above that. And then you go, why did the U.S.
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:52.880]  government pay Israel to radiate 110,000 Jewish children, but, but, but not Ashkenazi, uh, but,
[1:45:52.880 --> 1:46:00.720]  but, uh, but, uh, Sephardic. And, uh, so again, this is very, very complex. And I only cover the
[1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:08.000]  facts as we have them, as we, you know, see them. And, uh, it's just, I mean, look at what Albert
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:14.720]  Pike wrote, uh, in 1878. He said, we're going to have three wars. The first one between, uh,
[1:46:14.720 --> 1:46:20.080]  Christianity and communism. Then we're going to have another, uh, yeah. And, um, the, and then
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:23.600]  we're going to have another war. And then he describes this last war between Christians,
[1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:30.160]  Jews, and Muslims to discredit all those religions and then bring in this one world
[1:46:30.160 --> 1:46:34.720]  utopia religion. And then we're going to blame it on the Muslims, right? That was what I read it
[1:46:34.720 --> 1:46:38.640]  saying. Well, yeah, I mean, I mean, he just said we're going to have a war between,
[1:46:38.640 --> 1:46:43.120]  yeah, with all three of these groups, uh, basically fighting. And that was in 18,
[1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:53.120]  1870s. So, uh, I mean, we have to ask that question. Why, why did the West, why did the
[1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:59.360]  big banks fund Hitler? Why did the very same banks then fund the Bolsheviks?
[1:46:59.360 --> 1:47:05.760]  Communism, Zionism, everything. Well, I mean, that's the whole point is that they create
[1:47:06.400 --> 1:47:11.120]  these conflicts and that's what the public can't figure out. They want to say it's the Vatican,
[1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:16.400]  it's the Protestants, it's the Jews, it's the Masons, it's the Chinese, it's the, it's the,
[1:47:16.400 --> 1:47:21.680]  it's the, it's the Italian mafia. Well, they also want to say, oh, don't you think everybody would
[1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:25.600]  know about this stuff? Don't you think people would come out and say this? Like it's like they
[1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:29.760]  just want to go along with it. How they're, they can't believe how they were in the dark for so
[1:47:29.760 --> 1:47:34.480]  long about this stuff. Well, I'm not even saying I'm that smart and obviously I'm not that smart
[1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:39.040]  because it makes my head hurt trying to figure it all out. But the point is, is that it's the,
[1:47:39.040 --> 1:47:45.120]  it's divide and conquer and they, they create, uh, these different movements, these different groups
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:49.920]  and then they play us all off against each other and they're doing that right now with our new
[1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:55.520]  president. Uh, it's, it's, it's just bad. I mean, I don't know. What do you think's going to happen?
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:48:00.400]  Honestly, I think that, I mean, it's really sick. I'm, I'm really thinking they're going to go ahead
[1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:04.960]  and do this whole concentration camp thing, exterminate people who don't go along with it,
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:08.480]  exterminate the sick and the elderly. I really think this is all going to happen. Like I think
[1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:13.360]  it's coming. Well, it's already going on. See, but here's the thing. It's been in the Wall Street
[1:48:13.360 --> 1:48:17.760]  Journal, Wesley Smith for years written books about it where, where they're killing people,
[1:48:17.760 --> 1:48:22.720]  chain down begging for food and water when they're in government custody. If you sign yourself and
[1:48:22.720 --> 1:48:28.240]  you're a state over to the government, they murder you and there's thousands of admitted cases. I
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:35.600]  don't mean Terry Shiba who couldn't talk. Okay. They, the media picked that to give it attention
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:39.600]  because it looked like she was a vegetable so they could legitimize it. There are people
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:44.880]  begging for food and water being killed every day. Stay there. We're going to talk more about it
[1:48:44.880 --> 1:48:54.320]  on the other side with Charles in California than James, Vicki, Chris and a lot of other folks.
[1:48:54.320 --> 1:49:03.680]  So stay with us. Imagine feeling totally helpless. Imagine thinking and hearing clearly, but unable
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:10.240]  to move as the ground rises to meet you. Imagine the pain of a thousand needles as your body is
[1:49:10.240 --> 1:49:16.880]  invaded, locked and hammered by 50,000 volts of the latest in Taser technology. If this sounds
[1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:22.800]  scary, imagine how it would feel for anyone attempting to victimize a friend, loved one or

[1:49:57.840 --> 1:50:02.800]  May I have everybody's attention please? I've come with a message of information.
[1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:07.200]  9-Eleven was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the
[1:50:07.200 --> 1:50:12.240]  New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage? Was it engineered by you,
[1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:19.520]  David Rockefeller, the Frolateral Commission, the CFR? The day that we stop asking questions
[1:50:19.520 --> 1:50:25.120]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years
[1:50:25.120 --> 1:50:33.600]  after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening is taking place. An inside job? How dare
[1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:40.400]  you? If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:50:40.400 --> 1:50:46.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. If the government has not told the truth in five years,
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:50.560]  we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven. Please rise. Download the film at

[1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:03.520]  Okay, I'm going to continue here with your phone calls.
[1:52:03.520 --> 1:52:12.960]  Going back to Charles and California.
[1:52:18.880 --> 1:52:23.840]  Charles, you're always going to have people and groups that are going to use your name.
[1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:30.640]  And, you know, that's just part of life. It's part of business. It's what goes on. And that's why
[1:52:30.640 --> 1:52:35.680]  George Bush used the name Christian. The guy's not a Christian. He's an occultist. I've been to
[1:52:35.680 --> 1:52:41.680]  Bohemian Grove. I've covered it. Skull and Bones is deeply occultic. Everything they do is murderous.
[1:52:41.680 --> 1:52:46.480]  Look at their fruits. And it's the same thing with the leadership of Israel. It's the same thing
[1:52:46.480 --> 1:52:51.360]  with the leadership of every other major nation in the world, whether it's, you know, Maghabi
[1:52:51.360 --> 1:52:57.760]  and Rhodesia. It doesn't matter. Now, Zimbabwe, they are carrying out these types of tyranny.
[1:52:57.760 --> 1:53:05.520]  And it's just the nature of what we deal with as a society. You know, the larger issue here is we
[1:53:05.520 --> 1:53:16.400]  have trillions of dollars openly being stolen out of the Pentagon, out of the Treasury, and they're
[1:53:16.400 --> 1:53:20.960]  not even hiding it. They don't care. And people say, oh, that's just what government does. Well,
[1:53:20.960 --> 1:53:28.160]  what's next? I mean, the point is the corruption is just becoming biblical in proportion. Anything
[1:53:28.160 --> 1:53:32.560]  else you want to add, Charles? Yeah, it's just always problem-reaction solution. It seems like,
[1:53:32.560 --> 1:53:37.040]  you know, exterminate 6 million Jews, use that against everyone, make it, you know, we got to
[1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:41.200]  protect Israel. This way we could, because we know everyone hates Israel. So let's have war
[1:53:41.200 --> 1:53:45.520]  with everybody. And let's also call it more anti-Semitism by doing it in the name of defending
[1:53:45.520 --> 1:53:49.920]  Israel while the Jews don't even realize it so they get lined up again. You know what I mean?
[1:53:49.920 --> 1:53:54.400]  I just see it happening and it's scaring me, man. And if I could just ask you advice for one more
[1:53:54.400 --> 1:53:59.440]  thing, I live in California. And I don't know, it just seems like every gun is banned here, every
[1:53:59.440 --> 1:54:02.800]  good gun. I'm going to move up to the mountains and whatever, because I don't want to leave the
[1:54:02.800 --> 1:54:09.040]  country. I want to stay here and fight if I have to, protect myself. But I don't know, what do
[1:54:09.040 --> 1:54:17.120]  you suggest I do about guns and things like that? Well, I mean, firearms are fun. And it's part of
[1:54:17.120 --> 1:54:26.480]  your birthright as a free human being. So I would just encourage you to, you know, get a, I don't
[1:54:26.480 --> 1:54:30.080]  know how much money you have. If you can afford more than one, one gun, it's good to get a lot,
[1:54:30.080 --> 1:54:36.320]  but I would get a bolt action rifle, something that doesn't kick too bad, like a 223 or a 243.
[1:54:37.040 --> 1:54:41.280]  And I would go out to the shooting range, learn how to use it. And then after you have a bolt
[1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:46.720]  action rifle, I'd get a revolver and I'd get a shotgun. And you'll be in pretty good stead with
[1:54:46.720 --> 1:54:51.680]  those three firearms. And then just hope you never have to use them, work towards liberty and freedom
[1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:57.760]  and waking people up and saying no to the corrupt system, but you know, commit that you're never
[1:54:57.760 --> 1:55:02.960]  going to go to a forced labor camp. And then if just a small portion of the public fights back
[1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:07.920]  against a scenario like that, they will be forced back off. I appreciate your call.
[1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:14.080]  We're going to come back in the next hour, just continue with your phone calls. And I've gotten
[1:55:14.080 --> 1:55:18.560]  better. I think you've noticed taking calls, but we're going to take a lot of your phone calls.
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:21.760]  So that means each caller is just going to get about a minute, a minute and a half or so,
[1:55:21.760 --> 1:55:27.840]  because I love all the different directions that you take us in. 1-800-25-99231. I am not going
[1:55:27.840 --> 1:55:33.920]  to spend a lot of time on this, but people always ask me why I'm not that involved in Austin, Texas,
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:40.720]  out at events and doing local activism. The big reason is I'm so busy. The big reason is,
[1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:44.880]  I mean, I don't have a lot of spare time. I'm making documentaries. I'm doing other radio
[1:55:44.880 --> 1:55:50.480]  and TV interviews. I've really got to cut back on the amount of work I'm doing. I can't do more.
[1:55:51.520 --> 1:55:56.080]  That said, also, there's a lot of crazy people here locally who just always invent new stuff
[1:55:56.080 --> 1:56:01.280]  about me. You know, I opened up my email a minute ago with somebody saying, I'm going to kill you.
[1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:07.600]  You sabotage some radio thing and hack something and we have proof. I mean, I just can't deal with
[1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:13.120]  it anymore, man. People just constantly making stuff up and then I'm not friends with them,
[1:56:13.760 --> 1:56:23.360]  and so I'm bad. You know, that's why another reason I'm not involved in the Austin community,
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:27.840]  not with the general listeners. I just don't want to go to events because, you know, if somebody
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:34.160]  gets in my face, you know, I just can't handle it. I mean, I've been wronged. I'm just sick of the
[1:56:34.160 --> 1:56:44.960]  persecution. We'll be right back. Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com
[1:56:44.960 --> 1:56:53.760]  today. A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[1:56:53.760 --> 1:57:00.080]  this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is
[1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:05.040]  his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the
[1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:09.920]  first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside
[1:57:09.920 --> 1:57:15.200]  the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged
[1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:22.240]  in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's
[1:57:22.240 --> 1:57:27.040]  connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:57:27.040 --> 1:57:31.280]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:37.440]  much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality,
[1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:43.760]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv. Either you are with us or you are with the
[1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:58.320]  terrorists. Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:58:02.080 --> 1:58:09.280]  Big Brother government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones
[1:58:09.280 --> 1:58:25.840]  on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:38.080]  We are continuing with open phones today. The big story, the thing I'm outraged about,
[1:58:38.080 --> 1:58:42.800]  the thing I'm most concerned about, and I'd love to hear what the listeners have to say about this,
[1:58:42.800 --> 1:58:48.800]  is Bloomberg, the AP, and others are reporting what Paul Watson's condensed into one big report
[1:58:48.800 --> 1:58:58.240]  at prisonplanet.com. Fed hides destination of $2 trillion in bailout money, fails to comply with
[1:58:58.240 --> 1:59:04.880]  congressional demands for transparency, underscoring age-old problem of top-down socialism, and letting
[1:59:04.880 --> 1:59:10.880]  the fox guard the henhouse. The Federal Reserve is facing a lawsuit after it failed to comply with
[1:59:10.880 --> 1:59:18.800]  congressional demands for transparency and disclose the destination of at least $2 trillion in
[1:59:18.800 --> 1:59:25.280]  bailout funds, underscoring once again the failure of top-down socialism. Well, it's not a failure,
[1:59:25.280 --> 1:59:29.680]  it's designed to steal money. It's not even socialism, it's just a heist, it's a robbery.
[1:59:29.680 --> 1:59:33.520]  And the folly of trusting the foxes to guard the henhouse, we didn't trust them, though.
[1:59:33.520 --> 1:59:39.760]  Congress was told martial law would physically be declared, and the cowardly public said martial law
[1:59:39.760 --> 1:59:44.320]  doesn't exist, so that didn't happen. As they announced more brigades of North
[1:59:44.320 --> 1:59:54.240]  Coms rips to populate the U.S., this is a bank robbery going on. So I want to talk about that.
[1:59:54.240 --> 1:59:59.200]  Also, Paul Craig Roberts, who had been supporting Obama because Obama had said he'd get us out of
[1:59:59.200 --> 2:00:04.800]  Iraq and get rid of torture and get rid of the Patriot Act and that he was going to reverse
[2:00:04.800 --> 2:00:11.520]  the wiretapping without warrants, well, he's gone back on all of that now. And so Paul Craig Roberts
[2:00:11.520 --> 2:00:20.080]  has come out with Obama, Rambo, and the end of the American Century conned again. And so
[2:00:20.080 --> 2:00:30.880]  there that is right there for everybody to check out and to look at. Also, some of the other news
[2:00:30.880 --> 2:00:36.080]  I want to go over, a great article that's a boil down of mainstream news stories that said
[2:00:36.080 --> 2:00:40.960]  anti-fascist calling. I've got a link to it up on info wars.com. I had a guest on about it
[2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:45.440]  earlier in the hour. I am an FM and short of listeners had got to hear that. Our internet's
[2:00:45.440 --> 2:00:53.040]  been down at Genesis off and on. So you may have missed that, but it'll be out on the podcast
[2:00:53.040 --> 2:00:56.640]  later. So I'm going to go back over some of it, but I haven't covered it really in detail yet.
[2:00:57.200 --> 2:01:02.640]  Space-based domestic spying, kicking civil liberties to the curb.
[2:01:02.640 --> 2:01:13.840]  And we'll be breaking that down also 150 billion more for AIG U.S. government. Starbucks
[2:01:16.800 --> 2:01:23.040]  Starbucks fourth quarter profit drops 97% on closure cost.
[2:01:23.040 --> 2:01:32.640]  Also, Obama puts hundreds of Bush rulings under review. So that's the independent in England
[2:01:32.640 --> 2:01:37.040]  implying that Obama's going to reverse a bunch of what Bush has done. And we're going to see
[2:01:37.040 --> 2:01:41.440]  lots of PR stories claiming he's changed something, but we're going to look at the fine print of all
[2:01:41.440 --> 2:01:53.120]  of that because he's already announced he isn't changing anything. Also, we had the Republican
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:59.600]  Norm Coleman winning narrowly by about 725 votes in the Minnesota race. But suddenly,
[2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:05.040]  after recounts being done before the official recount at the polling places by the election
[2:02:05.040 --> 2:02:13.600]  officials, magically it looks like Al Franken may win. So we'll be going over some of that as well.
[2:02:13.600 --> 2:02:16.560]  And now the cops want to use smell to identify you.
[2:02:17.760 --> 2:02:21.840]  Odor printing could be used to identify people. Human beings could one day be identified by our
[2:02:21.840 --> 2:02:27.120]  smells. But in the research that shows individual odor prints cannot be masked by diet. You may
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:35.440]  have the over scent of garlic or cologne or whatever, but there's still that DNA print, that pheromone
[2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:40.480]  that is unique to you. So now they got a swab of your underarm or a dirty shirt,
[2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:44.400]  beds can set you up with that. That's the problem with all this DNA and all this other
[2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:50.640]  systems is they have been proven at crime labs everywhere to be framing people in mass. Your
[2:02:50.640 --> 2:02:57.600]  call straight ahead, stay with us. Hello friends, this is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time
[2:02:57.600 --> 2:03:01.520]  it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever. We need to be
[2:03:01.520 --> 2:03:06.160]  independent and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have
[2:03:06.160 --> 2:03:10.320]  your own bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your
[2:03:10.320 --> 2:03:15.280]  family in any emergency if you simply prepare. Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy
[2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:19.600]  bailout for the special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it. They turned off the
[2:03:19.600 --> 2:03:25.520]  telephones and email. They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air. This money now
[2:03:25.520 --> 2:03:30.640]  owns the American and European banks. The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[2:03:30.640 --> 2:03:36.080]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond many Americans
[2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:41.360]  reach. In pre-Nancy Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[2:03:41.360 --> 2:03:46.880]  until it reached over 4 billion marks. Food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there
[2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:51.840]  may be no end in sight. The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery
[2:03:51.840 --> 2:03:56.080]  stores enough money to restock their shelves. The stores have less food but jack of prices
[2:03:56.080 --> 2:04:00.880]  to stay in business. Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready. Everything
[2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:05.520]  is zeroing in on food. One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other
[2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:11.120]  necessities. My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food. For everybody
[2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:14.800]  out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storeable
[2:04:14.800 --> 2:04:19.200]  food, the government, the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset,
[2:04:19.200 --> 2:04:23.600]  a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness. No one is going to take care of your family

[2:04:59.360 --> 2:05:04.800]  The first step is getting storeable food. The Genesis Communications Radio Network probably
[2:05:04.800 --> 2:05:16.640]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:05:16.640 --> 2:05:36.080]  All right. So much is happening in the media. So much is going on in the news. We're taking a lot
[2:05:36.080 --> 2:05:43.920]  of phone calls. Your response to more than two trillion dollars and that's not even counting
[2:05:43.920 --> 2:05:48.960]  all the other money, but over two trillion dollars sucked out of the taxpayer coffers
[2:05:48.960 --> 2:05:54.320]  in the Treasury to the Federal Reserve given to themselves, given to their private member banks.
[2:05:55.280 --> 2:06:01.600]  You've got 12 regional banks. You've got a group of five private banks in the U.S. that hold stock,
[2:06:02.480 --> 2:06:08.240]  Chase Manhattan, Citibank, Wells Fargo and Bank of America in the private Federal Reserve and
[2:06:08.240 --> 2:06:13.520]  they're giving the money to themselves. That's all been admitted. I mean, it's funny. On one hand,
[2:06:13.520 --> 2:06:17.600]  they'll admit they're giving it to themselves as bonuses and to buy other banks. They'll even
[2:06:17.600 --> 2:06:21.920]  tell the New York Times, but then when Congress wants to see it, they say, no, you don't get any
[2:06:21.920 --> 2:06:27.040]  of the particulars. Now, can you imagine any other, I mean, even third-world countries aren't this bad.
[2:06:27.840 --> 2:06:32.880]  Normally, when the dictator or the corrupt group runs off, they'll run off with a few billion bucks
[2:06:34.240 --> 2:06:40.240]  and they'll run off to, if they were President Salinas, they'd run off to New York City or if
[2:06:40.240 --> 2:06:46.880]  they were in another third-world country, they'd run off to Europe. But no, not now. In America,
[2:06:46.880 --> 2:06:51.760]  they just say, we're going to set up a world government run by us and we're going to steal
[2:06:51.760 --> 2:07:01.840]  everything. And the military says, ooh-rah, ooh-rah. Just incredible. Let's go to your phone calls
[2:07:01.840 --> 2:07:09.120]  here. Who is up next here? James in Canada. James in Canada, you're on the air. Welcome.
[2:07:09.120 --> 2:07:13.280]  Hello, Alex. It's James Lachance here from Canada. How are you today?
[2:07:13.280 --> 2:07:16.560]  Good. Let me ask listeners a favor. I'm going to put him on hold real quick.
[2:07:17.440 --> 2:07:24.880]  I let people about 10 years ago call in and say their first names and second names,
[2:07:25.520 --> 2:07:32.480]  their last names. And I always wondered why I would hear Art Bell not let people do that.
[2:07:32.480 --> 2:07:39.360]  And that's because of lawsuits. Now, James, I'm not saying that your last name isn't Lachance,
[2:07:40.720 --> 2:07:46.240]  but the point is, is that people will call in and misrepresent themselves as other people
[2:07:47.200 --> 2:07:53.120]  and then people will claim that I have a liability to keep them off the air,
[2:07:53.920 --> 2:07:59.440]  which I really don't. But the point is, is that I'd really like it. I know it's a thing
[2:07:59.440 --> 2:08:04.880]  about showing who you are and being proud of yourself and being proud of who you are.
[2:08:06.400 --> 2:08:13.280]  But just generally, it's good unless I know you've been a guest on before. Maybe you have
[2:08:13.280 --> 2:08:18.720]  enough for God. People just use their first names. Okay, James, let's go back to James
[2:08:18.720 --> 2:08:23.440]  in Canada. Go ahead. Yeah. Hi, Alex. Sorry about that. It's okay. I've been trying to,
[2:08:23.440 --> 2:08:25.840]  I've been trying to do it. It's not your fault. It's a neurotic,
[2:08:25.840 --> 2:08:30.960]  cowardly population's fault. But go ahead. Exactly. I actually have laid Alex. I've
[2:08:30.960 --> 2:08:37.600]  been basically trying to not be incognito when I'm sending my message of freedom and truth out on
[2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:41.280]  the internet. No, that's the answer. That's the answer. I certainly not ashamed of the message
[2:08:41.280 --> 2:08:45.680]  that we're sending out. Well, I agree. If anybody wants to talk to me, they know how to get a hold
[2:08:45.680 --> 2:08:51.200]  of me. No problem. Well, I agree. I mean, just to elaborate on this, we have to be out in the open.
[2:08:51.200 --> 2:09:03.360]  We have to reach out to people and we have to be able to show people this is mainstream. This
[2:09:03.360 --> 2:09:09.520]  isn't embarrassing. This isn't bad. Saying it's wrong to have two trillion openly stolen from us
[2:09:09.520 --> 2:09:14.240]  or it's wrong to have Defense Department spy satellites spying on us. You know, we're the
[2:09:14.240 --> 2:09:18.160]  good people. My point, Alex, is whether I come in and call you is reptoid or I call you as
[2:09:18.160 --> 2:09:23.280]  XBJ. It doesn't really matter. They know I'm calling you anyway. So what difference does it make?
[2:09:24.400 --> 2:09:29.760]  You know, well, here's my point, Alex. I just returned from the remembered
[2:09:29.760 --> 2:09:35.840]  stage ceremony. My father's a Korean War veteran and he was asked to go give a speech at our local
[2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:42.320]  high school here. My daughter's high school and it was just an absolute wonderful experience for
[2:09:42.320 --> 2:09:48.000]  the 900 kids that were in that auditorium listening to my dad. Give us testimony about fighting
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:54.720]  in Korea for the freedom and family love that, you know, he has for our family and the love
[2:09:54.720 --> 2:10:02.320]  that he has for his country. He went to Korea in 1951. He's seen the whole dirty game over there.
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:07.600]  Did it for God and I should say king and country up here at that time.
[2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:14.640]  And the same thing with our fellow veterans in the United States. The brave men fought and died
[2:10:14.640 --> 2:10:21.840]  in all of the wars for our freedom. Today is remembrance day. And I just want all of your
[2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:26.400]  audience there, Alex, who are very intelligent people, obviously, if they're listening to you
[2:10:26.400 --> 2:10:34.640]  on a regular basis to remember our fallen soldiers who died for our freedom. And that's why they
[2:10:34.640 --> 2:10:40.880]  went there and they fought. They fought for our freedom. And by God, Alex, because they were
[2:10:40.880 --> 2:10:46.960]  conned in some cases, it's no excuse for us not to respect them. It's no excuse not for us to
[2:10:46.960 --> 2:10:53.680]  stand at attention when we're playing a national anthem. We need to respect every single member
[2:10:53.680 --> 2:10:58.240]  of the military throughout the world as trying to fight for our freedom. Whether they know the
[2:10:58.240 --> 2:11:04.560]  truth or not, Alex, these people are putting their lives on the line. And I tell you, man,
[2:11:04.560 --> 2:11:12.080]  I've grown up with this my whole life. And part of the problem here is sometimes maybe we get a
[2:11:12.080 --> 2:11:20.960]  little too energetic or aggressive with the truth. And breaking through to some of these people
[2:11:21.600 --> 2:11:28.480]  is important that we do it with a very soft approach. And that's just part of my message
[2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:33.040]  for this morning. I have one question. Well, I always hear that as the conventional wisdom.
[2:11:33.040 --> 2:11:38.400]  And I found that of the different different ways awaken people up. That's the least effective.
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:44.240]  You know, everybody possible, Alex, that's possible. But my point is we had a couple of
[2:11:44.240 --> 2:11:51.520]  young widowed brides at our ceremony here today. And you know, I may be the only one that was
[2:11:51.520 --> 2:11:58.000]  awakened that auditorium play for all I know, I have no idea of knowing. But you know, I'm just
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:04.320]  looking at this whole chronic one. So you know, what we better let me hold on. Let me let me
[2:12:04.320 --> 2:12:12.080]  say a few things here. Yeah, we better just let them have their delusion, their view, because
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:17.040]  it may be a complete lie and a fraud, but it's too painful for them to ever really learn that.
[2:12:17.040 --> 2:12:23.120]  Now, I'm not saying that that's what you're saying, but we can't choose our reality. Reality is
[2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:32.480]  reality. Perception is not reality. It's delusion. And so I'm not saying that there aren't cases.
[2:12:33.120 --> 2:12:39.280]  I'm not saying that there aren't times when the light handed approach isn't better with
[2:12:39.280 --> 2:12:46.560]  certain people. I'm saying per capita or on average, we need to be upset. We need to be out in the
[2:12:46.560 --> 2:12:53.440]  open about all of the just unprecedented crimes that we see being committed by corrupt elites.
[2:12:53.440 --> 2:12:58.880]  Now, I got to move quick, spend about six, seven minutes with you. What is your question?
[2:12:59.600 --> 2:13:05.600]  Well, I guess I, you know, I'm just looking at the top of the New World Order, if we can for a
[2:13:05.600 --> 2:13:12.400]  second. And every time I see basically the Illuminati summer, whatever the eye of whatever it
[2:13:12.400 --> 2:13:18.800]  is. There's always a crowd involved with it, Alex, whether it's a Mason thing or a British
[2:13:18.800 --> 2:13:24.000]  thing or an Israeli thing or, you know, there's always a crowd at the top of it. And I'm wondering
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:31.040]  if you have any insight as to possibly who would be at the very top of this New World Order.
[2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:34.400]  Well, there's a lot of speculation. In fact, our movement, and I appreciate your call,
[2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:39.360]  spends most of its time talking about that instead of the unfolding New World Order system.
[2:13:39.360 --> 2:13:47.840]  But we know who is at the top. It is the Saxe-Coburg gothers out of England,
[2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:56.400]  intermarried with the Rothschilds, and into less than 20 other European and U.S. families.
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:05.520]  Coming up later, after I take some more calls, Democrats target 401Ks and IRA retirement accounts.
[2:14:05.520 --> 2:14:09.680]  We're going to be getting into that. Let's continue with your phone calls now here.
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:17.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Vicki in Ohio. Vicki, you're on the air.
[2:14:17.920 --> 2:14:22.400]  Oh, yeah, Mr. Jones. Yes, go ahead. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I never can tell if you hear me.
[2:14:22.400 --> 2:14:25.200]  No, no, I can hear you. I know you're in a hurry. I have a couple questions.
[2:14:25.200 --> 2:14:30.880]  And I hear the war drums beating for a win. Being an evangelical, I'd like to correct that.
[2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:34.560]  I know where to get the unilateral support from Israel is a verse in the Bible says,
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:42.640]  God will create a nation in a day. A nation will be spiritually reborn in a day.
[2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:46.240]  He meant it the second coming of Christ. That's what the Bible's intent was.
[2:14:46.880 --> 2:14:50.560]  God did not give the Zionist permission to go over there and kill innocent Arabs and
[2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:53.840]  steal their land. I'm just trying to help you out. Sure. You know where it's coming from?
[2:14:53.840 --> 2:14:57.360]  You don't have enough support for anyone. I'd rather just not even argue with people,
[2:14:57.360 --> 2:15:01.440]  according to what the Bible says, because they can twist in any way they want.
[2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:08.720]  It's wrong to shoot Palestinian children and laugh about it. It's wrong for Israel to be
[2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:14.640]  involved in the white slavery trade like it is. And it's wrong for any other country to be involved
[2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:21.280]  in that. I mean, Jesus spoke out against the Sadducees, the Pharisees, and said,
[2:15:21.280 --> 2:15:26.560]  you're corrupt and bad. You're going to get Israel judged. And almost every prophet came to Israel
[2:15:26.560 --> 2:15:32.080]  and said, you've done wrong. God is going to judge you. God is going to send you into captivity.
[2:15:32.080 --> 2:15:38.000]  Now, according to these modern phony evangelical churches, no one is allowed to criticize Israel
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:43.760]  because the Christian faith is now about worshiping whoever happens to be the government of Israel
[2:15:43.760 --> 2:15:50.320]  and whatever new crime they're committing. And so that's the bottom line there. But at the same
[2:15:50.320 --> 2:15:56.960]  time, my religion isn't worshiping Israel, but my religion is also not bashing Israel. And Vicki,
[2:15:56.960 --> 2:16:00.080]  I appreciate your call. Kristin, New Jersey, you're on the air.
[2:16:02.080 --> 2:16:10.880]  I was just wondering what the new Bretton Woods II is. There were several, I go to a college,
[2:16:10.880 --> 2:16:18.480]  and there were several students trying to sign up people to join this movement. I didn't really
[2:16:18.480 --> 2:16:24.880]  understand what it was. You mean there are people at the college trying to sign people up to support
[2:16:24.880 --> 2:16:32.000]  the new Bretton Woods? Yes, sir. I called you because, I mean, I don't agree with you all the
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:37.520]  time, but I think your points are interesting. I was wondering what your opinion was. Okay,
[2:16:37.520 --> 2:16:44.720]  Chris, stay there. Stay there. And again, I wasn't trying to cut Vicki off. I looked down,
[2:16:44.720 --> 2:16:50.480]  and then looked back up and like six, seven minutes had passed for the last caller. And then I'm just
[2:16:50.480 --> 2:16:54.320]  going to try to get to more of your calls. When we come back, I'll briefly answer your question
[2:16:54.320 --> 2:17:01.200]  and get more specifics from you, Chris. They have dispatched bankers everywhere to push people
[2:17:01.200 --> 2:17:07.120]  accepting this. A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of
[2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:13.280]  war against this country. The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:18.400]  Bin Laden. This is his ammo. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:23.200]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:17:23.200 --> 2:17:28.000]  networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:35.360]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[2:17:35.360 --> 2:17:40.880]  detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian
[2:17:40.880 --> 2:17:45.120]  connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government,
[2:17:45.120 --> 2:17:51.760]  and much, much more, fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality,

[2:20:01.520 --> 2:20:05.680]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power? If so,
[2:20:05.680 --> 2:20:10.400]  this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear. Solar power generators are now
[2:20:10.400 --> 2:20:15.120]  available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[2:20:15.120 --> 2:20:19.680]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[2:20:19.680 --> 2:20:24.960]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity
[2:20:24.960 --> 2:20:30.240]  for free. It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home. Run some pumps,
[2:20:30.240 --> 2:20:34.960]  shortwave radios, computers and even keep food from spoiling. Whether it's hurricanes,
[2:20:34.960 --> 2:20:40.080]  ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:20:40.080 --> 2:20:45.040]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[2:20:45.040 --> 2:20:52.240]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today. That's MySolarBackup.com today.
[2:20:52.240 --> 2:21:01.120]  Or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
[2:21:01.120 --> 2:21:20.080]  Is it getting better? Or do you feel the same?
[2:21:20.080 --> 2:21:33.840]  Will it make it easier on you now? You've got someone to blame. You said one love,
[2:21:35.760 --> 2:21:45.840]  one life. When it's one leap in the night, one love, we get to share it.
[2:21:45.840 --> 2:21:51.600]  Yeah, going back about two months ago when the bankers were getting cranked up,
[2:21:51.600 --> 2:21:58.800]  trying to force through the emergency stimulus package, I saw national news stories and local news
[2:21:58.800 --> 2:22:05.200]  stories even here in Austin where the Federal Reserve was sending out PR firms, their local
[2:22:05.200 --> 2:22:10.880]  regional bank heads. They were telling other banks that they regulate, that they're basically
[2:22:10.880 --> 2:22:15.920]  over-criminally. Again, private banks have regulation power over other smaller banks, which they
[2:22:15.920 --> 2:22:22.800]  criminally consolidate. And they sent them out everywhere to brainwash the public and say,
[2:22:22.800 --> 2:22:27.280]  go along with the bailout. You've got to have it or there'll be a depression.
[2:22:28.640 --> 2:22:33.760]  And we've got to have a new economic system and the public's got to get behind it.
[2:22:33.760 --> 2:22:39.840]  And we have to demand this new currency. And we have to demand carbon taxes paid to the banks.
[2:22:39.840 --> 2:22:48.320]  This will fix everything. And so you can just Google banks and representatives to push bailout
[2:22:48.320 --> 2:22:57.120]  plan or local bank president speaks to high school. And that's because public relations is
[2:22:57.120 --> 2:23:02.720]  important. And reaching out to the community is important. That's why whenever 9-11 truth goes
[2:23:02.720 --> 2:23:08.880]  out and speaks to people, it's so important. That's why when land rights groups go out and stand
[2:23:08.880 --> 2:23:14.480]  up, it's important. Second amendment groups, whatever the case is, it's having an effect,
[2:23:14.480 --> 2:23:19.840]  putting up a website, putting up a YouTube video, making a documentary film, starting a local
[2:23:20.480 --> 2:23:24.160]  newsletter that you get a few advertisers for and put out in your neighborhood.
[2:23:25.920 --> 2:23:30.880]  It doesn't matter. Just get the information out and try to make itself sufficient so it can
[2:23:30.880 --> 2:23:35.760]  pay for itself so you can continue to do it. That's the answer. Use the free market.
[2:23:35.760 --> 2:23:41.200]  And I tell people, go buy two or three hours on a Saturday or Sunday night on local AM station.
[2:23:41.840 --> 2:23:46.960]  It's very inexpensive, maybe 50 bucks, 100 bucks an hour, maybe 200 bucks if it's a big station.
[2:23:47.680 --> 2:23:51.760]  You can get a few sponsors for that. Most of you got money to pay for that yourself
[2:23:51.760 --> 2:23:58.240]  or have your own business be the sponsor. And you're going to reach thousands of people every week.
[2:24:00.080 --> 2:24:02.960]  I mean, you look at these politicians and these criminal corporate leaders,
[2:24:02.960 --> 2:24:07.200]  they're out there working hard to sell their agenda of tyranny and lies.
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  Going back to the caller who brought up his college, Chris is saying,
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:19.360]  you don't even agree with me on quite a few things, but he called me about this.
[2:24:19.360 --> 2:24:23.840]  Why, Chris, did you hear me tell you that they had their brainwashing squads out there pushing this?
[2:24:24.960 --> 2:24:29.760]  Well, yeah, yeah, earlier. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I don't agree with you all the time.
[2:24:29.760 --> 2:24:35.440]  Well, sir, I don't make up anything. Okay, I don't lie. I operate according to truth,
[2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:40.560]  whether people like it or not. And, but I mean, specifically, what were they saying and doing
[2:24:40.560 --> 2:24:47.840]  and who were they? Well, the thing that caught my eye, I usually ignore those kind of, I don't know,
[2:24:49.120 --> 2:24:55.280]  I guess, booths, I guess. And in the thing that, you know, there was a poster on their sign that
[2:24:55.280 --> 2:25:03.040]  said New Bretton Woods or like, was like, or like, or we'll go into the dark ages,
[2:25:03.600 --> 2:25:09.760]  is what they were saying. And I was like, um, what? So, so I asked them, you know, what their
[2:25:09.760 --> 2:25:16.640]  positions were, and they weren't very articulate at their making their point. But they were saying,
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:21.200]  and I said, what about the bailouts? And they go, Oh, we're against the bailouts.
[2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:26.880]  I don't know, I just didn't really trust what they were saying. It's all about deception. Yeah,
[2:25:26.880 --> 2:25:32.000]  the international banks engineer the consolidation, the takeover known by the slave public as the
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:37.520]  bailout. I mean, the public was 98% in every major rules, 95 to 98,000 to one phone calls
[2:25:37.520 --> 2:25:43.840]  into Congress against it. Imagine how mad they would be if they knew it was all a scam engineered
[2:25:43.840 --> 2:25:49.280]  by design to consolidate the economy. And if they knew it was all designed to basically
[2:25:49.280 --> 2:25:55.840]  bankrupt things, imagine how mad they would be if they knew this was all a piracy operation.
[2:25:55.840 --> 2:26:00.720]  But, but yeah, no, now they've got the bankers out. It's all over the news. It's no secret.
[2:26:01.520 --> 2:26:07.440]  Pushing the new Bretton Woods agreement coming up the 14th and 15th this meeting in Washington,
[2:26:07.440 --> 2:26:11.200]  then they're going to have follow up meetings in Europe a few weeks after that to set up the
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:16.720]  new global currency run full and foreign by the private banks where they will regulate the world
[2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:21.680]  markets and the world stock markets and other banks. They will come in using governmental power
[2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:25.440]  and shut down other banks and insurance companies that they don't own and control.
[2:26:26.080 --> 2:26:32.000]  And then meanwhile on the 14th, 15th, 16th, they're having a homeland security drill with North
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:37.360]  Com to practice martial law takeover. Now I'm not saying that anything's going to happen on those
[2:26:37.360 --> 2:26:42.960]  dates. Some people are running around doing that. I'll be blamed for it. I'm saying these are all
[2:26:42.960 --> 2:26:49.360]  part of larger takeover drills. Anything else? Hey, yeah, try to record those guys put it up on
[2:26:49.360 --> 2:26:55.520]  YouTube. That's how we're going to defeat this. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[2:26:56.400 --> 2:26:59.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:06.400]  Phase one of the insiders plan for a one world government has been initiated with the recent
[2:27:06.400 --> 2:27:11.520]  bailout. International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a
[2:27:11.520 --> 2:27:16.160]  new currency and a new world bank to act as savior. But we've only seen the beginning.
[2:27:16.160 --> 2:27:20.320]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[2:27:20.320 --> 2:27:24.880]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land. The insiders have
[2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:30.720]  discovered that they must control two things to seize total power. Phase one is a one world currency
[2:27:30.720 --> 2:27:35.360]  which we are currently being prepared to accept. Phase two of their insidious plan is complete
[2:27:35.360 --> 2:27:45.360]  control of our food supplies. Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details. That's www.foodshortageusa.com

[2:28:06.960 --> 2:28:11.520]  I went to ground Sierra and we knew what to do. At least we thought we did.
[2:28:11.520 --> 2:28:17.120]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to
[2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:27.440]  tell their story. Whitman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:28:27.440 --> 2:28:32.640]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take
[2:28:32.640 --> 2:28:37.760]  action against their global masters. He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:44.560]  He takes his hand off in year 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. This is an emergency
[2:28:44.560 --> 2:28:51.760]  transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it
[2:28:51.760 --> 2:28:57.280]  worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com. If we don't expose the government-sponsored
[2:28:57.280 --> 2:29:00.480]  terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.

[2:30:20.080 --> 2:30:27.280]  MSNBC reported yesterday that they think it'd be a good idea to force medicate the public with
[2:30:27.280 --> 2:30:35.280]  statins or anti-cholesterol drugs in the water. There are literally probably thousands,
[2:30:35.280 --> 2:30:42.080]  I've seen hundreds of studies saying, without even looking, that statins attack your artery walls,
[2:30:42.080 --> 2:30:50.160]  attack your brain, your liver, your brain is made up out of cholesterol. In fact, the majority
[2:30:50.160 --> 2:30:55.360]  of the non-water component of your brain is cholesterol. It's an electrochemical
[2:30:55.920 --> 2:31:00.320]  computer, really oil-based. And that's why they tell people that have a lot of seizures
[2:31:00.320 --> 2:31:04.320]  to eat more fatty foods. There are a bunch of studies showing fatty foods are actually really
[2:31:04.320 --> 2:31:09.440]  good for brain activity. So, of course, the New World Order doesn't want us to be eating things
[2:31:09.440 --> 2:31:15.200]  that actually increase in most intelligence. Obviously, too much fat or the trans fats,
[2:31:15.200 --> 2:31:20.640]  the artificial fats, your body isn't designed to eat are water-deadly. But are they going to
[2:31:20.640 --> 2:31:25.680]  take those out? Absolutely not. They're just going to restrict the good fats. But later,
[2:31:25.680 --> 2:31:30.720]  I'm going to play that newscast where they are saying that they want to put it in the water
[2:31:30.720 --> 2:31:35.680]  supply. It's up on prisonplanet.com. Then they say, oh, but the public won't want it like the
[2:31:35.680 --> 2:31:40.720]  Communist plot for fluoridation. Then they all giggle. So, I'm also going to play a clip on that
[2:31:40.720 --> 2:31:51.200]  front. I want to go to Herb, Fred, Steve, Jason, Chris, Michelle. But I also want to go ahead and
[2:31:51.200 --> 2:31:58.480]  get into Democrats' Target 401k and IRA retirement accounts. Now, this is going to happen.
[2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:04.160]  And this was proposed a long time ago by the IMF and the World Bank. And we warned you about this
[2:32:04.160 --> 2:32:09.760]  in my book, 9-11 to Set in the Terrany, published in 2002. By the way, almost out of print. There's
[2:32:09.760 --> 2:32:14.560]  a few hundred copies left. If you want to order one at infowars.com, just want to let you know I'm
[2:32:14.560 --> 2:32:21.440]  not reprinting it. But it just costs too much to print 5,000, 10,000 more of those suckers.
[2:32:21.440 --> 2:32:24.160]  And so, I'm just going to let it die. I'm going to go out of print. It's a great book, but I'm
[2:32:24.160 --> 2:32:30.080]  done with it. Plus, the printer I used is out of business. I don't have to go have it all redone.
[2:32:30.080 --> 2:32:36.880]  And I just don't have the time, folks. I wish I had more time. There's so much work we could do,
[2:32:36.880 --> 2:32:43.520]  such an important work we could get done. And I also apologize to our affiliates out there that
[2:32:43.520 --> 2:32:48.800]  I've not been doing the best radio yesterday or today. I'm normally sharper, more focused,
[2:32:48.800 --> 2:32:55.040]  more energetic. But I'm here, nevertheless, live. You ever had one of those upper respiratory
[2:32:55.040 --> 2:33:01.360]  things that goes up and down from your chest to your sinus? So, I'm kind of out of it, but I'm
[2:33:01.360 --> 2:33:09.440]  here. So, bear with me, please. But I want to get into Democrats target 401k and IRA retirement
[2:33:09.440 --> 2:33:17.920]  accounts. I want to get into that. And so, what I'm going to do is I'm going to cover this story
[2:33:17.920 --> 2:33:26.000]  first. Paul Watson's doing a wider report on it, and then we will go to your phone calls.
[2:33:29.280 --> 2:33:34.000]  Before I do that, I do want to encourage all of the listeners of this radio show to become
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:42.960]  PrisonPlanet.tv members. PrisonPlanet.tv has thousands of pieces of media. All
[2:33:42.960 --> 2:33:51.200]  19 of my films, the two films I've produced separate from that, so 21 films total that I've been
[2:33:51.200 --> 2:33:56.720]  involved with, scores of other films have been authorized opposed by the makers, hundreds and
[2:33:56.720 --> 2:34:01.520]  hundreds and hundreds of my weekly TV reports, hundreds and hundreds of in-studio interviews,
[2:34:03.120 --> 2:34:08.160]  hundreds of other special reports where you'll have like, you know, an hour and 45 minutes of
[2:34:08.160 --> 2:34:18.800]  extras that aren't on the in-game DVD that are on PrisonPlanet.tv for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[2:34:19.360 --> 2:34:23.600]  We just put up three and a half hours of Willie Nelson interviews behind the scenes and
[2:34:23.600 --> 2:34:27.840]  Jesse Ventura interviews and the two of them talking to each other. I mean, really neat stuff
[2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:37.840]  like that for PrisonPlanet.tv members. We are pretty much moved into the other office.
[2:34:37.840 --> 2:34:43.040]  I'm still tweaking a few things and getting ready to move out of here,
[2:34:44.640 --> 2:34:50.960]  but we're just going to start dumping masses of other video and footage nobody's ever seen
[2:34:50.960 --> 2:34:57.200]  going back over the years at PrisonPlanet.tv and the quality just gets better and better.
[2:34:57.200 --> 2:35:02.080]  The super fast downloads are the streaming. It's all at PrisonPlanet.tv and I want to
[2:35:02.080 --> 2:35:07.920]  thank all the members at PrisonPlanet.tv. You make so much of what we do possible here and we
[2:35:07.920 --> 2:35:12.400]  just keep making it better and better for you. If you don't have a PrisonPlanet.tv membership,
[2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:21.040]  I would encourage you to get one today. Now, some other sponsors I want to tell you about
[2:35:21.040 --> 2:35:30.480]  is folks like FoodShortageUSA. FoodShortageUSA are just great folks. You can check them out
[2:35:30.480 --> 2:35:37.360]  at FoodShortageUSA.com. This website reveals a step-by-step way for the average person to get
[2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:42.480]  prepared for what's ahead. I think the best part of the system is that it gets you off the food
[2:35:42.480 --> 2:35:47.040]  grid even if you don't have a lot of money to spend beside this FoodShortageUSA.com.
[2:35:48.160 --> 2:35:53.840]  It's not too late. You can still prepare by learning how to make your own survival foods
[2:35:53.840 --> 2:35:59.520]  and you can do this for pennies on the dollar. Again, go to FoodShortageUSA.com or call 877-
[2:35:59.520 --> 2:36:10.640]  327-0365-877-327-0365. Another one of our great sponsors is a KolaBloob and I cannot say enough
[2:36:10.640 --> 2:36:15.920]  about this. We just ordered one for my house. My wife has been drinking the water here at the
[2:36:15.920 --> 2:36:22.320]  office. She doesn't really work here much other than doing some bookkeeping. My point is she
[2:36:22.320 --> 2:36:26.080]  doesn't come into the office. She works from home. She hadn't been here in months. She was like,
[2:36:26.080 --> 2:36:30.560]  man, this is great water. This comes out of the air. I said, yeah, there's no normal humidity.
[2:36:31.120 --> 2:36:35.600]  About seven and a half gallons a day in your average environment. The lowest is about three
[2:36:35.600 --> 2:36:43.440]  gallons. It can do about 10 gallons. It's got five filters built into it and it goes through these
[2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:49.280]  five filters after it's grabbed out of the atmosphere. There is no fluoride. There is no
[2:36:49.280 --> 2:36:54.720]  arsenic. There is no mercury. There is no bacteria. This is all out of the air and goes through five
[2:36:54.720 --> 2:37:00.640]  filters. Check them out at ecolobloobloom.com or there's big banners on infowars.com and

[2:37:14.320 --> 2:37:26.560]  Okay. Hope you check them out. Democrats target 401Ks and IRA retirement accounts. Democrats in
[2:37:26.560 --> 2:37:32.800]  the U.S. House have been conducting hearings on proposals to confiscate workers' personal
[2:37:32.800 --> 2:37:38.560]  retirement accounts, including 401Ks and IRAs, and convert them to accounts managed by the Social
[2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:44.160]  Security Administration. Triggered by the financial crisis of the past two months, the hearings
[2:37:44.160 --> 2:37:51.200]  reportedly were meant to stem losses incurred by many workers and retirees whose 401Ks and IRA
[2:37:51.200 --> 2:37:55.200]  balances have been shrinking rapidly. Now, what did I tell you months ago? It's going to be just
[2:37:55.200 --> 2:38:00.320]  like Argentina and other countries. They're taking it to keep it safe. The government always wants
[2:38:00.320 --> 2:38:07.280]  to keep you safe and always wants to help you. They love you. The test, that's a joke for those
[2:38:07.280 --> 2:38:15.360]  drinking fluoride. The testimony of Teresa Gardisilli. We're going to get her on. Professor of economic
[2:38:15.360 --> 2:38:21.760]  policy analyst at the New School for Social Research in New York in a hearing October 7th
[2:38:21.760 --> 2:38:25.920]  through the most attention and criticism. And I've been reading these testimonies. That's
[2:38:25.920 --> 2:38:30.320]  why I told you about this a while back. I mean, they really did say this. Testifying for the
[2:38:30.320 --> 2:38:35.360]  House Committee for Education and Labor, she proposed that the government eliminate tax breaks
[2:38:35.360 --> 2:38:40.400]  for 401Ks and similar retirement accounts such as IRAs. They're talking about, by the way,
[2:38:40.400 --> 2:38:46.160]  retroactively. Oh yeah, they're going to take them. And confiscate workers' retirement. That's a quote.
[2:38:46.160 --> 2:38:51.520]  Composite workers' retirement plan accounts and convert them to a universal guaranteed retirement
[2:38:51.520 --> 2:38:56.320]  accounts, but with a lower yield. Managed by the Social Security Administration. See,
[2:38:56.320 --> 2:38:59.280]  they're not going to let Social Security go bankrupt. They're going to steal
[2:38:59.280 --> 2:39:04.640]  the 40% of the public that actually saved. This whole system is about punishing
[2:39:05.200 --> 2:39:09.520]  the middle class who actually saves and isn't on the government trough.
[2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:15.200]  And then they're going to take that. They're going to tell the poor people they're going to get it.
[2:39:15.200 --> 2:39:19.920]  They'll really only get a few percentage points, a few crumbs that'll be highly advertised.
[2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:26.000]  The foreign bankers will get it all. Representative George Miller,
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:28.960]  Democratic California chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor,
[2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:35.120]  and prepared remarks on the hearing on the impact of financial crisis on workers' retirement
[2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:39.520]  security, blame Wall Street for the financial crisis, and said his committee will strengthen
[2:39:39.520 --> 2:39:43.920]  and protect Americans' 401K pensions and other retirement plans. And the Democratic Congress
[2:39:43.920 --> 2:39:47.600]  will continue to conduct the much needed oversight on behalf of the American people.
[2:39:47.600 --> 2:39:54.000]  Currently, 401K plans allow Americans to invest pre-tax money and their employers match up to
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:40:00.160]  defend to a defined percentage, which not only increases workers' retirement savings,
[2:40:00.160 --> 2:40:04.320]  but also reduces their annual income tax. The balances are fully inheritable,
[2:40:06.160 --> 2:40:10.560]  subject to income tax, meaning workers pass on their wealth of their heirs,
[2:40:10.560 --> 2:40:15.360]  unlike Social Security, even when they leave an employer and go to
[2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:23.680]  and go to one that doesn't offer a 401K or pension, workers can transfer their balances
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:31.840]  to a qualified IRA. Okay. And it's being proposed as mandating equality. You're
[2:40:31.840 --> 2:40:36.560]  for equality, aren't you? Give us your money. You're not racist, are you? Give us your money.
[2:40:36.560 --> 2:40:46.640]  The bankers need it. And there's several other news articles covering all of this. Again,
[2:40:46.640 --> 2:40:52.480]  Paul Watson's doing a more detailed one on it, but we're going to get the people pushing this on
[2:40:52.480 --> 2:41:00.240]  the show. Now, notice how this dialectic works. The psychological warfare operation works.
[2:41:00.240 --> 2:41:06.560]  A Democrat, on average, will see anything and everything that a Democratic leader says
[2:41:06.560 --> 2:41:12.800]  through the lens of, that's my team, that's my family, that's my tribe, that's my group,
[2:41:12.800 --> 2:41:23.680]  that's my organization I support. It must be a good thing. It must be a thing that is going to
[2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:33.280]  help me and my family. And now the Democrats are saying private corporations, capitalism, free
[2:41:33.280 --> 2:41:43.280]  market did this. When in reality, it is government, instead of letting these financial institutions
[2:41:43.280 --> 2:41:51.040]  that engage in all these crimes fail, they're coming in and saying, okay, we'll bail you out
[2:41:51.040 --> 2:41:58.160]  with two trillion plus dollars so far of taxpayer money given directly to the private
[2:41:58.160 --> 2:42:02.160]  federal reserve. And then they give it to their private member banks who say they're keeping it
[2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:08.720]  for bonuses. But that, it's even worse than that. See, I'm going along the lines of debate
[2:42:12.480 --> 2:42:17.440]  of, oh, the banks are in trouble. They need to be bailed out because of bad investments. But
[2:42:17.440 --> 2:42:22.800]  that really wasn't true. We had economists on. We looked at the real numbers. The banks control
[2:42:22.800 --> 2:42:27.040]  the fiat currencies. They could have easily covered the few hundred billion in bad mortgages,
[2:42:27.040 --> 2:42:33.440]  but instead they advertise that it was horrible, that it was infecting everything to destroy
[2:42:33.440 --> 2:42:37.280]  confidence. They then said we were going to have a depression if they weren't given the
[2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:42.960]  bailout. But the bailout wasn't even the issue, the 840 billion that was really five trillion
[2:42:44.320 --> 2:42:49.360]  that they've already gotten two trillion of. The issue was the empowerment they got. And
[2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:52.560]  then as soon as they got the money, they didn't put any of it into the economy.
[2:42:52.560 --> 2:42:58.320]  So see how ridiculous it is to hear the Democrats saying, oh, well,
[2:42:59.680 --> 2:43:03.040]  you know, private corporations did this, they got out of control.
[2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:09.200]  And then the government had to step in to fix things. No, private corporations came in and
[2:43:09.200 --> 2:43:14.960]  bought off the government. And the private corporations, the private banks already own
[2:43:14.960 --> 2:43:18.800]  the media and they came out and told the public, we're going to have a depression if you don't
[2:43:18.800 --> 2:43:23.440]  bail us out and give us all these new powers. But the public knew they were apacaliers and said,
[2:43:23.440 --> 2:43:31.600]  no, we're not going along with it. And so the government said, we don't care what you want,
[2:43:31.600 --> 2:43:36.240]  we're going to save the economy, we're going to bail them out. And then it turned out it wasn't
[2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:43.920]  a bailout, it was unlimited power for these private institutions. It was the setup of world government.
[2:43:43.920 --> 2:43:53.120]  Okay. And so now the Democrats come out and say, the free market did this, the free market
[2:43:53.120 --> 2:43:59.680]  caused all of this and show that government has to take over all these pension funds in 401ks and
[2:43:59.680 --> 2:44:09.280]  tax them and regulate them and take big percentages of them because you can't trust them invested
[2:44:09.280 --> 2:44:14.960]  in the stock market. And then the government's going to take that money and hand it as interest
[2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:20.560]  on debt to the private banks. You understand how that works? Not only are the private banks given
[2:44:20.560 --> 2:44:25.120]  all of our money, then we've got to pay interest on the money that we give them.
[2:44:27.360 --> 2:44:33.120]  See, it's so dastardly, so corrupt. It's so evil. I can't even explain it. I mean,
[2:44:33.120 --> 2:44:40.640]  how do you explain something this corrupt? How do you explain something this bad?
[2:44:40.640 --> 2:44:43.440]  I mean, Paul, you're in there. Is this making sense what I'm saying?
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:47.840]  So you're saying you're confused. Let me...
[2:44:50.800 --> 2:44:56.000]  And see, that's why the public can't figure this out because it is just so mind-boggling.
[2:44:56.000 --> 2:45:06.080]  The banks set up a system to where banks can issue unlimited liquidity. It's not even real
[2:45:06.080 --> 2:45:12.960]  paper money in the banks. They then buy up bridges and infrastructure and media companies
[2:45:12.960 --> 2:45:19.920]  and defense contractors and toll roads and water districts. They then loan money to governments,
[2:45:19.920 --> 2:45:26.960]  county, city, state that doesn't exist at huge interest rates. They get more and more power,
[2:45:26.960 --> 2:45:32.320]  more and more control. Then they come in and shut off liquidity, shut off credit to Main
[2:45:32.320 --> 2:45:36.720]  Street and the general public, and the economy starts grinding to a halt. And they all fear
[2:45:36.720 --> 2:45:41.120]  monger and say, give us unlimited government power and unlimited trillions of dollars,
[2:45:41.920 --> 2:45:47.360]  and then we'll save the economy. They get the money and laugh at the public and say,
[2:45:47.360 --> 2:45:52.400]  we were never insolvent. We're hoarding it and keeping it for tens of millions of dollars per
[2:45:52.400 --> 2:46:00.560]  company and bonuses to our CEOs and managers. Then they have the Democrats put into office
[2:46:00.560 --> 2:46:04.880]  in the name of stopping all of this because the public really thinks George Bush, the puppet,
[2:46:04.880 --> 2:46:11.760]  did it all. He certainly stood by and helped do it, but he's just a puppet. And now the Democrats
[2:46:11.760 --> 2:46:16.800]  come in and say, man, these private corporations have sure robbed us. We're just going to take
[2:46:16.800 --> 2:46:23.040]  your pension funds in 401ks now and tax them and take large percentages of them to keep them safe.
[2:46:23.040 --> 2:46:27.520]  I mean, that's a lie right there. We're going to take a bunch of your money to keep it safe.
[2:46:27.520 --> 2:46:32.320]  I mean, there's the congressman saying it. So see, it's so many lies, every word,
[2:46:32.320 --> 2:46:37.440]  every statement is a lie. You have to stop and analyze each little fragment, each little piece.
[2:46:39.360 --> 2:46:43.120]  Then he goes on and blames the free market for all of this.
[2:46:43.120 --> 2:46:51.200]  That'd be like if bank robbers went and stuck up a bank and the police walked out and had a press
[2:46:51.200 --> 2:47:02.000]  conference and said, the free market caused this. The free market did this. We've got an outlaw
[2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:07.440]  having banks because banks get robbed. That's kind of like we've got to ban guns because people shoot
[2:47:07.440 --> 2:47:12.480]  each other. Yeah, bad people and good people need them to protect themselves. So this is just the
[2:47:12.480 --> 2:47:16.560]  total takeover. This is how world government finally happened of foreign by the bankers.
[2:47:16.560 --> 2:47:20.560]  And they've got the Democrats saying we're going to take your 401k plan. We're going to take your
[2:47:20.560 --> 2:47:25.360]  pension fund under government control. We're going to not make a tax exempt. We're going to retroactively
[2:47:25.360 --> 2:47:29.680]  steal large percentages of it. You're going to get this as a government check from us.
[2:47:30.240 --> 2:47:33.120]  We're just going to steal the whole stock market, but then
[2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:42.560]  they're going to make the socialist end of it government stealing it from it. But the profit
[2:47:42.560 --> 2:47:48.160]  end of it, that'll still go to the foreign banks. I mean, just unspeakable. But at the end of the
[2:47:48.160 --> 2:47:52.960]  day, the point is they're stealing your 401ks, they're going to steal your retirement accounts,
[2:47:52.960 --> 2:47:57.040]  and they're going to do it the name of protecting it and then blaming the free market while they
[2:47:57.040 --> 2:48:00.800]  do it when they engineered the whole thing to begin with. And this isn't free market. This is
[2:48:00.800 --> 2:48:04.800]  robbery through government by private interest. Making a chlorophyll rich beverage has been found

[2:51:00.720 --> 2:51:08.560]  The preacher man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi
[2:51:08.560 --> 2:51:15.120]  folks bottom line. The government is totally illegitimate. It is openly criminal. It is not
[2:51:15.120 --> 2:51:21.280]  our government. All the governmental powers have been handed over to the executive and from the
[2:51:21.280 --> 2:51:26.800]  executive it's been handed over to private international boards made up of the private banks.
[2:51:26.800 --> 2:51:37.600]  Beneath them sits the defense contractors in the media and they own them. And you've got to ask
[2:51:37.600 --> 2:51:45.680]  yourself what are they planning? What are they going to do next if they're openly doing things
[2:51:45.680 --> 2:51:48.800]  that have never been done before in the history of the world?
[2:51:48.800 --> 2:51:59.680]  And both parties are for this. The Democrats and the Republicans, if you read the committee notes
[2:51:59.680 --> 2:52:09.840]  in the House, both groups are looking at taxing and regulating and controlling. You see the
[2:52:09.840 --> 2:52:16.240]  Republicans want to make you put your money into a 401k and they agree with the Democrats.
[2:52:16.240 --> 2:52:21.200]  Yeah, and then go ahead and let the government control that. So see how there are two hands on
[2:52:21.200 --> 2:52:27.200]  the same system. Democrats in the House have been conducting hearings on proposals to confiscate
[2:52:27.200 --> 2:52:32.560]  workers' personal retirement accounts, including 401ks and IRAs, and convert them to accounts
[2:52:32.560 --> 2:52:37.760]  managed by the Social Security Administration. That was the lead sentence in an article entitled
[2:52:37.760 --> 2:52:42.800]  DIM's Target Private Retirement Accounts published by the Carolina Journal on November 4th.
[2:52:42.800 --> 2:52:49.920]  With those alarming openers, the article has gone viral over last week, at least among those who
[2:52:49.920 --> 2:52:54.320]  advocate less government interference in their economic lives. That's why we're doing a bigger
[2:52:54.320 --> 2:53:03.600]  report. Unfortunately, the Carolina Journal is only telling half of the story. The bad Democrat
[2:53:03.600 --> 2:53:12.560]  half, Obama, missing from the Carolina Journal is the Republican half that suggests replacing
[2:53:12.560 --> 2:53:18.480]  voluntary 401k contributions and savings with mandatory retirement savings accounts. This
[2:53:18.480 --> 2:53:24.400]  oversight is in keeping with the target market for the Carolina Journal establishment Republicans
[2:53:24.400 --> 2:53:30.640]  who like their partnership dressed up in libertarian platitudes. The Carolina Journal is the flagship
[2:53:30.640 --> 2:53:42.080]  publication of the North Carolina-based John Locke Foundation, which again is a neocon think tank,
[2:53:42.080 --> 2:53:48.400]  basically, but also raises money by bringing to town neoconservative. Bigger government is
[2:53:48.400 --> 2:53:53.760]  better for spreading democracy luminaries like William Crystal and Frank Gaffney. Absolutely,
[2:53:53.760 --> 2:54:03.280]  this is from jbs.org and Jim Campo. I want to get Jim on the show, but that's it. The Republicans
[2:54:03.280 --> 2:54:07.920]  fool everybody saying, hey, we need to make people invest in 401ks. That's what the Democrats are
[2:54:07.920 --> 2:54:11.280]  saying. And then once they've done that, they're going to hijack them one way or the other.
[2:54:13.360 --> 2:54:20.000]  When are people going to figure out that anything that's in a bank account, anything that is in a
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:26.560]  401k, anything that is not in your hand can be taken by these criminals. And then they can send
[2:54:26.560 --> 2:54:32.320]  their paramilitary goons to confiscate physical things. I mean, all over this country for 25
[2:54:32.320 --> 2:54:37.680]  years, the police take cars, homes, businesses without anything illegal being found under
[2:54:37.680 --> 2:54:42.880]  acid forward to seizure. You're not supposed to talk about it, but it happens all over the
[2:54:42.880 --> 2:54:54.320]  country from Florida to Texas to New York to California where they pull over an old lady.
[2:54:54.320 --> 2:54:58.000]  She's got five grand in her purse. They just take it, saying, well, prove it any legal.
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:04.720]  No judge, no jury, no due process. And don't tell me I'm bashing cops. Just like when the Denver
[2:55:04.720 --> 2:55:09.680]  Post reported Friday that cops dressed up like anarchists and went out and attacked other cops,
[2:55:09.680 --> 2:55:15.760]  then the cops arrested real protesters and sent them to jail charged with attacking cops.
[2:55:16.320 --> 2:55:22.160]  That's called stage terror, false flag. What you're doing is wrong. You work for a criminal
[2:55:22.160 --> 2:55:29.200]  government. Stop lying. You're here to squeeze more blood out of the fat hog public. I'm not your
[2:55:29.200 --> 2:55:33.520]  enemy. I want you to wake up and realize you're destroying your own future as well.
[2:55:33.520 --> 2:55:40.240]  So yeah, nothing's safe when you live under tyranny. We'll be right back. Stay with me.
[2:55:40.240 --> 2:55:44.880]  We're going to go live at Prison Planet dot TV. Hello friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you
[2:55:44.880 --> 2:55:49.040]  for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever.
[2:55:49.040 --> 2:55:53.120]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:57.360]  bread line if you have your own bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for
[2:55:57.360 --> 2:56:02.320]  FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare. Our elected representatives
[2:56:02.320 --> 2:56:06.720]  wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do
[2:56:06.720 --> 2:56:12.160]  it. They turned off the telephones and email. They voted to print $850 billion at least out of
[2:56:12.160 --> 2:56:16.960]  thin air. This money now owns the American and European banks. The exploding inflation that
[2:56:16.960 --> 2:56:21.760]  is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities,
[2:56:21.760 --> 2:56:26.800]  particularly food beyond many Americans reach. In pre-Nazi Germany, superinflation,
[2:56:26.800 --> 2:56:31.840]  the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks.
[2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:36.240]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[2:56:36.240 --> 2:56:40.640]  The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money
[2:56:40.640 --> 2:56:45.200]  to restock their shelves. The stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business.
[2:56:45.200 --> 2:56:49.600]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready. Everything is zeroing
[2:56:49.600 --> 2:56:54.400]  it on food. One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[2:56:54.400 --> 2:56:59.360]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food. For everybody out
[2:56:59.360 --> 2:57:02.880]  there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable
[2:57:02.880 --> 2:57:07.280]  food, the government, the new-old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset,
[2:57:07.280 --> 2:57:11.680]  a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness. No one is going to take care of your family
[2:57:11.680 --> 2:57:15.600]  in the final equation but you. You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship
[2:57:15.600 --> 2:57:20.480]  storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports and they

[2:57:49.360 --> 2:58:03.200]  We are live at prisonplanet.tv in the fourth hour every day we go live or prisonplanet.tv
[2:58:03.200 --> 2:58:07.920]  viewers. We also do a lot of behind the scenes stuff with prisonplanet.tv viewers and the
[2:58:07.920 --> 2:58:11.920]  infowars.com stream listeners. I do want to tell you we got some really big guests
[2:58:11.920 --> 2:58:18.000]  for lined up later in the week that we have lined up. I'm a bit under the weather so put
[2:58:18.000 --> 2:58:24.160]  up with me if I'm a little bit more sluggish than normal. Just a program note. People are
[2:58:24.160 --> 2:58:29.760]  wondering why I sound different. Got a lot of news I want to go over but first I want to get
[2:58:29.760 --> 2:58:33.520]  all these great callers out of the way who have been holding like Herb and Fred and Steve, Jason,
[2:58:33.520 --> 2:58:41.120]  Chris, Michelle, and others. Then I'm going to play a CNBC clip where they are talking about
[2:58:41.120 --> 2:58:49.360]  how statins are so wonderful and how even if you have regular cholesterol, all cholesterol is bad.
[2:58:49.360 --> 2:58:54.320]  We need to put cholesterol in the water, put statin in the water so that you don't drink the
[2:58:54.320 --> 2:59:00.240]  evil cholesterol. That's one clip. Then there's another great YouTube clip, a compilation of clips
[2:59:00.240 --> 2:59:05.520]  with doctors and scientists that will play here also at prisonplanet.tv. So everybody
[2:59:05.520 --> 2:59:13.280]  can check that out coming up later in the hour but for those that just joined us in the last
[2:59:13.280 --> 2:59:19.200]  three hours I covered the prisonplanet.com story by Paul Watson reporting from Bloomberg and AP
[2:59:19.200 --> 2:59:26.640]  and others that $2 trillion of the $5 trillion has been put out and we've got links to the
[2:59:26.640 --> 2:59:32.160]  mainstream admitting that but $2 trillion of it, the Federal Reserve is saying we're not even going
[2:59:32.160 --> 2:59:38.320]  to tell you where the taxpayer money went, that is secret. Now if that isn't just corruption
[2:59:38.880 --> 2:59:42.880]  beyond anything imaginable in your face, I don't know what is but we kept telling people
[2:59:42.880 --> 2:59:48.080]  that was in the bank or takeover bill. That bill wasn't even so much about the money as it was
[2:59:48.080 --> 2:59:54.720]  about the new emperor-like, god-like financial power this gave the private Federal Reserve to do
[2:59:54.720 --> 3:00:01.280]  whatever it wants with the Treasury Department and for it to be secret and so they are raping
[3:00:01.280 --> 3:00:07.200]  us big time right now. Also we've read multiple reports here for you with the quotes Democrat
[3:00:07.200 --> 3:00:15.280]  401k compensation proposal is Republican mandatory savings plan both parties together saying they
[3:00:15.280 --> 3:00:20.080]  are going to tax and they are going to take over and they are going to make it a government check,
[3:00:20.080 --> 3:00:25.280]  they are going to steal it in the name of protecting it. That's why the big private
[3:00:25.280 --> 3:00:31.440]  central banks cut off liquidity two years ago, a year and a half ago to buy design, bring the
[3:00:31.440 --> 3:00:36.480]  economy down so they could have a consolidation of it and I am just totally outraged. Let's take
[3:00:36.480 --> 3:00:40.560]  a call right now that we're going to come back and get to everybody else. I appreciate everybody
[3:00:40.560 --> 3:00:50.160]  holding. Herb in Atlanta, Georgia, you're on the air. Hey Alex. Hi. Proud Prison Planet TV member.
[3:00:50.160 --> 3:00:56.400]  Thank you. And you know Alex, I want to pick up on something you said in Marshall Law 9-11
[3:00:56.400 --> 3:01:03.200]  rise of the police state and this, I'm going to look into the mind of a psycho and this
[3:01:03.200 --> 3:01:09.200]  coup-detected general public that we have here. As an absolute statement of fact, we've been on
[3:01:09.200 --> 3:01:15.200]  the Marshall Law since 1913 with the construction of the Federal Reserve Bank and the internal
[3:01:15.200 --> 3:01:20.320]  revenue service. Now, if you look at this capstone that you revealed to us, the Bilderberg Group
[3:01:20.320 --> 3:01:25.440]  Crap on the private central bankers and the Council on Foreign Relations and the empty shirt
[3:01:25.440 --> 3:01:32.080]  politicians who are basically controlled by the military industrial complex, our economy is tied
[3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:40.400]  up in war that benefits the military industrial complex period. Alex. Yes, sir. I'm just listening
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:48.720]  to you here. You're absolutely right. It is, it's just absolutely horrible what we're facing and
[3:01:48.720 --> 3:01:54.240]  you know, they sell the public to get involved in the evil. They say, yeah, the war is good for
[3:01:54.240 --> 3:01:58.320]  the economy. It's good for the people. So go ahead and go along with it. You know, we got to make
[3:01:58.320 --> 3:02:04.080]  money, but it costs the people money. You know, I mean, there are so many yuppies in people who've
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:09.600]  bought into war and evil and yeah, we need that oil from Iraq. You're not getting that oil from
[3:02:09.600 --> 3:02:15.680]  Iraq, folks. But sounds like you've got more to say, Herb, and you're right on. You want to add
[3:02:15.680 --> 3:02:20.400]  some points after the break? Yes, I do. Okay, I want to hear from you and everybody else,
[3:02:20.400 --> 3:02:24.400]  and I'm going to try to sit back and let folks roll. I'm going to take a lot of calls
[3:02:24.400 --> 3:02:30.560]  in this hour and we've got some key video clips as well coming up. So please stay with us. We'll
[3:02:30.560 --> 3:02:35.440]  be right back. Okay, John, I'm going to skip this break with all the psych. I'm going to skip this
[3:02:35.440 --> 3:02:40.480]  break. And I'm going to keep talking with Herb. And then we go back to the full audience. You're
[3:02:40.480 --> 3:02:45.760]  just on the web right now. But I don't want to waste any time, Herb, here in the fourth hour,
[3:02:45.760 --> 3:02:48.960]  as we strive to skip most of the breaks here. Please continue.
[3:02:50.480 --> 3:02:57.360]  I made a statement on satellite radio last February. And I said this, America, as we once knew
[3:02:57.360 --> 3:03:04.320]  it or her, cease to exist in the year 2000, with the Bush Nazi crime family's coup d'etat down in
[3:03:04.320 --> 3:03:09.840]  Florida. And I said the so-called way forward was what I was talking about, the Iraq surge
[3:03:09.840 --> 3:03:15.280]  is coming from the Federal Reserve Bankers, the Council on Foreign Relations, and all of the
[3:03:15.280 --> 3:03:20.960]  devotees of the Bush Nazi crime family's New World Order, our global government, global economy,
[3:03:20.960 --> 3:03:27.440]  global media, global religion. If R.K. Obama is not stopped from entering the White House
[3:03:27.440 --> 3:03:32.400]  as an illegal alien, this plan of the New World Order and the New Age movement is going to be
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:36.880]  escalated. It's going to be put on steel rods. And I hope you let me make my last comment about
[3:03:36.880 --> 3:03:46.400]  this Fed protest coming off the 22nd of this month. Oh, absolutely. Genesis has run ads for the folks
[3:03:46.400 --> 3:03:53.520]  that are doing that. Gary Franchi. And I even was the one that recommended to Ted that he do that.
[3:03:53.520 --> 3:03:58.400]  And then I get emails saying I haven't been plugging in enough. So I can't do it all. But
[3:03:58.400 --> 3:04:03.600]  absolutely. I heard it. Sure. Let's come back to the full audience here in about a minute and a
[3:04:03.600 --> 3:04:10.880]  half and plug the Fed protest nationwide. I think that's important because, again,
[3:04:10.880 --> 3:04:16.080]  it draws attention to who the real bad guys are instead of the diversion, the distraction,
[3:04:16.080 --> 3:04:22.560]  Barack Obama, John McCain. And, you know, I don't want to say that I got sucker punched,
[3:04:22.560 --> 3:04:28.960]  but I really wanted to like Barack Obama. But he snuck up on people. He said, oh,
[3:04:28.960 --> 3:04:32.400]  I'm going to end the war. Oh, I'm not going to have warrantless wiretapping. And I remember
[3:04:32.400 --> 3:04:38.560]  Jesse Ventura and Willie Nelson and everybody else on here like nine months ago saying maybe he's
[3:04:38.560 --> 3:04:44.880]  good. And then as soon as he got people's confidence, he just turned around and said,
[3:04:44.880 --> 3:04:50.640]  I'm going back on all of that. But the general public has now wedded themselves to him,
[3:04:50.640 --> 3:04:55.680]  just like Republicans did to Bush. And so they're now going to go along with whatever
[3:04:55.680 --> 3:05:03.200]  he does. And so I want to hear you speak to Barack Obama and his presidency and why specifically
[3:05:03.200 --> 3:05:07.360]  you say he's going to help bring in this whole agenda. I happen to totally agree with you,
[3:05:07.360 --> 3:05:10.960]  the carbon tax. I mean, if people don't think our economy is already screwed up,
[3:05:10.960 --> 3:05:16.640]  wait till you see this, the bankers looting everything. And so that's why more than ever,
[3:05:16.640 --> 3:05:21.680]  we've got to expose the fact that the Federal Reserve is the problem. And this protest coming
[3:05:21.680 --> 3:05:28.720]  up on the 22nd of this month is so important. So we'll talk about that with you, Herb, when we
[3:05:28.720 --> 3:05:33.840]  get back and then go to Fred, Steven, Jason, Chris, Michelle, and many, many others that are
[3:05:33.840 --> 3:05:50.720]  patiently holding. Here we go. Everything else is window dressing, talking about Barack Obama,
[3:05:50.720 --> 3:05:57.120]  the big media event, talking about Sarah Palin still, their puppets, they run nothing. And
[3:05:57.120 --> 3:06:02.160]  the Federal Reserve is the issue, the private banks that are riping us that don't want a free
[3:06:02.160 --> 3:06:07.360]  market, that don't want a real economy, that don't want our families to be strong. I see all
[3:06:07.360 --> 3:06:13.440]  these women and men on TV saying, my problems are all solved. The one has arrived, the Savior,
[3:06:13.440 --> 3:06:20.560]  the President of the world, the President of the planet, the Savior. Meanwhile, his whole agenda
[3:06:20.560 --> 3:06:23.440]  is New World Order. Finishing up what you were saying, Herb.
[3:06:24.560 --> 3:06:29.920]  The gospel message of about 30 years is getting to the point where I can't talk to anybody but
[3:06:29.920 --> 3:06:34.720]  Alex Jones, but you know what? I take what God gives me. I want to pull the covers off the beast.
[3:06:34.720 --> 3:06:40.880]  November 22nd, 1963, the last real President that we had was gunned down publicly executed.
[3:06:40.880 --> 3:06:47.920]  November 22nd, 2008, 45 years later, Alex, we got the immovable object is getting ready to meet
[3:06:47.920 --> 3:06:53.280]  the irresistible force. And you know about the protest in 38 cities. Alex, what I'm saying is
[3:06:53.280 --> 3:06:59.120]  this, buddy, something is going to have to give, and there's absolutely no mention in the media.
[3:06:59.120 --> 3:07:06.080]  They are enamored with this Barack Obama clown, which as you say, prophetically, is nothing but a
[3:07:06.080 --> 3:07:13.360]  puppet puppet. And if you look at the compartmentalization of the New Age movement, the New World
[3:07:13.360 --> 3:07:17.680]  Order, rather, he has been crapped on by the private central bank. He's going along with
[3:07:17.680 --> 3:07:23.840]  everything. Like you say, he's gone back on the wiretapping. He's going to go back on everything
[3:07:23.840 --> 3:07:27.120]  and the people who are going to be most affected are all these people who are walking around
[3:07:27.120 --> 3:07:31.840]  to my, yes, we can. What they should be saying is what we want. And you know what? I am sick
[3:07:31.840 --> 3:07:38.000]  and tired of all of this New Age, New World Order crap. And I'm just like you, but I got my powder
[3:07:38.000 --> 3:07:41.920]  dry. But you know what? The crap's going to hit the fan, and I'm going to be ready.
[3:07:42.480 --> 3:07:47.280]  God bless you. Good to hear from you. In fact, there's so many guests that is I have on air,
[3:07:47.280 --> 3:07:53.360]  and then I never telegraph them to Trey. Before I forget this, telling to go set up Gary Franchi,
[3:07:53.360 --> 3:07:57.280]  the Loneliner Society, I think he's the one heading up that fed thing. I can't tell. He's
[3:07:57.280 --> 3:08:01.440]  got so many websites. I know I've linked to it and plugged it and Genesis has a link up to it.
[3:08:02.320 --> 3:08:10.320]  But yeah, that's a great idea. On the anniversary of when the Federal Reserve murdered JFK,
[3:08:10.320 --> 3:08:14.720]  people should protest the Fed. In fact, they've got a Federal Reserve up in Dallas.
[3:08:15.920 --> 3:08:19.600]  And I'm going to be up there for the JFK Memorial anyways, making a documentary. So
[3:08:19.600 --> 3:08:26.800]  I'm going to be at that. And I hope to see folks out there at the Dallas event.
[3:08:28.800 --> 3:08:33.920]  And at the other Fed banks around the country. There's 30 something of them.
[3:08:35.200 --> 3:08:40.240]  But there's 12 major regional banks. They've got offices and mints all over.
[3:08:40.960 --> 3:08:43.360]  Hopefully I won't run into Michelle Malkin again or anything.
[3:08:43.360 --> 3:08:49.200]  And let's go ahead and go to Fred in Philly. Fred, you're on the air.
[3:08:50.080 --> 3:08:53.280]  Alex is one of the best shows you've had. You've covered the news
[3:08:54.080 --> 3:09:02.000]  very well. And I just want to say that on the issue of the Bloomberg News suit versus the Fed,
[3:09:02.720 --> 3:09:08.240]  I dug around even though the government's closed and I've got the docket number for that.
[3:09:08.240 --> 3:09:17.040]  And I would advise people get a hard copy of that before it's dismissed or sealed. O8CV9595.
[3:09:19.040 --> 3:09:24.960]  Okay, that's O8CV9595. And where is that filed?
[3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:28.880]  U.S. District Court, District of New York. And the interesting...
[3:09:28.880 --> 3:09:34.400]  Hey, do me a favor. Email that to Aaron at infowars.com and we'll copy it and put in
[3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:38.720]  our format and post it right now. Yeah, and I just want to say... Well, for those that don't know,
[3:09:38.720 --> 3:09:43.200]  though, and I know I'm interrupting, you've been holding a while, tell them what the lawsuit
[3:09:43.200 --> 3:09:49.520]  deals with because new listeners every second. Well, you mentioned the cause of action. I don't
[3:09:49.520 --> 3:09:54.720]  have that in front of me, but you... It's $2 trillion plus has gone to the private
[3:09:54.720 --> 3:10:00.000]  Federal Reserve and they're saying we're not going to let the media or Congress know who it
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:06.000]  was given to that it's secret. And our right to know under the law, under the
[3:10:07.120 --> 3:10:12.960]  bailout legislation and the Freedom of Information Act. Well, you watch. It's going to get thrown out
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:17.520]  because I read that bill. It has all this language about how it's going to be transparent
[3:10:17.520 --> 3:10:24.400]  unless the Treasury Secretary says no. Well, I find it interesting that the
[3:10:24.400 --> 3:10:32.480]  Board of Governors are in Washington, but this suit is found in New York and I don't know what
[3:10:32.480 --> 3:10:37.520]  the target is. Is it the Federal Reserve Bank of New York? Because that would indicate that
[3:10:37.520 --> 3:10:44.800]  that one organization has more power than our constitutionally provided. They probably did
[3:10:44.800 --> 3:10:50.560]  it in New York because they control the press and the media more there.
[3:10:50.560 --> 3:11:01.360]  Well, the Bloomberg... The government is closed today, so like I said, I would try to get hard
[3:11:01.360 --> 3:11:07.760]  copy. I can't email that at this moment, but I'm saying I would try to get a summary and a copy of
[3:11:07.760 --> 3:11:17.360]  that. And what article did you find this in? Bloomberg, AP, a couple others. Go to prisonplanet.com.
[3:11:17.360 --> 3:11:23.360]  Fed hides destination of $2 trillion in bailout money. Okay, well, thanks a lot, Alex. Thank you.
[3:11:23.360 --> 3:11:27.760]  I appreciate your call. Good to hear from you, Fred. Stephen in Canada, you're on the air. Stephen,
[3:11:27.760 --> 3:11:34.800]  welcome. Hi, Alex. How are you? Pretty good. Alex, I just want to say to you, my friend Dennis,
[3:11:34.800 --> 3:11:40.800]  we respect your work and all the time you've made the people aware on your documentaries,
[3:11:40.800 --> 3:11:47.520]  such as Endgame. Thank you. My question is, Alex, how big is Canada's role in the global agenda?
[3:11:47.520 --> 3:11:53.520]  I understand America's role, but Canada always seems to go under the radar in this global scam.
[3:11:53.520 --> 3:11:59.760]  The gun control, the mandatory vaccines in my country is crazy. The restrictions on free speech,
[3:12:01.280 --> 3:12:07.600]  the people being arrested for their speech, the police harassing you, your border guards,
[3:12:07.600 --> 3:12:13.680]  harassing your own citizens. Canada is one of the most tyrannical countries in the Western world,
[3:12:14.240 --> 3:12:17.680]  and that's not just myself. A lot of human rights groups have said that,
[3:12:17.680 --> 3:12:24.000]  but they have this nice candy coating to it so people aren't aware. It is very important.
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:30.960]  It has more resources than the United States. It has as many resources as Mexico. It is incredibly
[3:12:30.960 --> 3:12:39.120]  wealthy, and the people there are in law-law land, but I've looked at your laws. Those aren't
[3:12:39.120 --> 3:12:45.280]  really mandatory. They engage in hoaxes claiming it's mandatory, just like here in the U.S. and
[3:12:45.280 --> 3:12:50.960]  England. There is no law. They just lie, again, showing how criminal your government is,
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:12:57.280]  and tell you it's the law. But Canada is very, very important in the scheme of things.
[3:12:57.280 --> 3:13:04.400]  Do they practice the eugenics? Absolutely. They have euthanized just the
[3:13:04.400 --> 3:13:09.520]  last two years. Whole Indian tribes have been sterilized. They killed the children.
[3:13:10.720 --> 3:13:16.240]  That was on CBC TV just last year. Well, you probably heard of it. It was big news.
[3:13:17.520 --> 3:13:20.480]  They just murder them wholesale. They just murder the foster children.
[3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:29.600]  By the way, listeners, don't roll your eyes. Go look up eugenics or Canadian government
[3:13:29.600 --> 3:13:34.400]  kills Indians, kills natives. I mean, certainly you've heard of that. I know it's big news up there.
[3:13:36.560 --> 3:13:42.960]  Have you heard about that, Stephen? Oh, I hear a lot of things up here. I'm also reading in my
[3:13:42.960 --> 3:13:48.720]  local newspaper, Alex, about sodium fluoride, my city in Kitchener Waterloo in Ontario,
[3:13:48.720 --> 3:13:54.080]  promise of Ontario. They are encouraging us to drink this dirty water.
[3:13:54.800 --> 3:13:58.880]  They love you. They care about you so much. It's very important you drink that.
[3:13:58.880 --> 3:14:03.440]  Sodium fluoride and Alex, the water is a different color for God's sake.
[3:14:04.720 --> 3:14:08.640]  Listen, I grew up in Dallas. I grew up in Dallas, and I thought all there was was,
[3:14:08.640 --> 3:14:11.840]  and I remember drinking water, getting a headache, brushing my teeth, getting a headache,
[3:14:11.840 --> 3:14:16.800]  and nobody told me about it. I didn't know. And then now I have this wonderful Valhalla
[3:14:16.800 --> 3:14:21.280]  of drinking distilled water or reverse osmosis water or murky water, and I've got all these
[3:14:21.280 --> 3:14:25.760]  different types of filtration systems. In my bathrooms, I've got burkeys, and then I've got
[3:14:25.760 --> 3:14:31.600]  reverse osmosis for cooking, and I've got distilled, and I've got these, you know, generator machines.
[3:14:32.240 --> 3:14:37.120]  You want to hear the funny part, Alex? They are banning bottled water.
[3:14:37.120 --> 3:14:44.400]  I know. It's for the earth because you don't need that water. In fact, they say in San Francisco
[3:14:44.400 --> 3:14:49.440]  and Oregon and other areas banning in the U.S., you don't need that. The tap water just fine for you.
[3:14:50.160 --> 3:14:56.560]  And the plastic's bad for the earth, which it is, but again, it sets that precedent. I have
[3:14:56.560 --> 3:15:05.040]  articles here where they're, again, in England, they're going to roadside hot dog shacks and
[3:15:05.040 --> 3:15:11.520]  saying, you can't just sell hot dogs. You've got to sell a healthy dish. Now, that sounds reasonable,
[3:15:11.520 --> 3:15:17.520]  but think of the state power to say what you can serve or what you can eat. That's the power to
[3:15:17.520 --> 3:15:22.640]  make you take shots, make you take drugs. I appreciate your call. Now is a good time to play this
[3:15:22.640 --> 3:15:28.320]  statin clip. Now statins, don't believe me, Google it. You'll be reading government reports industry.
[3:15:29.120 --> 3:15:32.560]  It came out in the last few years. Maybe you shouldn't take statins. They attack your heart.
[3:15:32.560 --> 3:15:37.680]  They attack your liver. They attack your brain. Your whole body is made up out of cholesterol.
[3:15:37.680 --> 3:15:43.120]  That's cholesterol and vitamin C and vitamin A bind to make your tissue, your connective tissue.
[3:15:45.360 --> 3:15:49.040]  But older women cut all the fat out of their diet and wonder why their bodies go to hell
[3:15:50.480 --> 3:15:58.640]  because they lose their connective tissue. But they are now demonizing all cholesterol.
[3:15:58.640 --> 3:16:01.600]  They, it's a long four-minute clip. We're not going to play it all. You go watch the
[3:16:01.600 --> 3:16:08.720]  prisonplanet.com. But the headline reporter, what's the headline, John? I forget the exact headline.
[3:16:10.480 --> 3:16:14.240]  CNBC host recommends statins to be put in the water supply.
[3:16:15.040 --> 3:16:20.000]  Yes. CNBC host recommends that statins be put in water supply. And so they go on to tell you
[3:16:20.000 --> 3:16:25.040]  that the drug company says that it's good for everybody and any cluster on your body is bad.
[3:16:25.760 --> 3:16:29.600]  Now it's already been proven that the statins don't actually help you and actually hurt you.
[3:16:29.600 --> 3:16:35.520]  Healthy men go take them and drop dead. It's like they admit the HPV shot it and good for you.
[3:16:36.320 --> 3:16:40.880]  Go ahead and play the last minute of it. High levels of cholesterol in the blood
[3:16:41.760 --> 3:16:46.080]  don't necessarily cause heart disease. It could be, oh no, they do cause heart disease.
[3:16:46.080 --> 3:16:50.400]  Now you're talking about average levels of cholesterol in the blood somehow are contributing
[3:16:50.400 --> 3:16:56.720]  to heart disease as well, right? No. Low levels of cholesterol, but with a high level or elevated
[3:16:56.720 --> 3:17:03.040]  CRP, if you have over two, these people in this study, I think, had something like a level of four.
[3:17:04.080 --> 3:17:08.080]  The bottom line is it's not just cholesterol that you have to be watching. Right. So when you go in
[3:17:08.080 --> 3:17:13.600]  for your blood test now, especially you, Joe, being over a certain age, you're going to say,
[3:17:13.600 --> 3:17:18.560]  not only check my HDL and LDL, make sure they put HSCRP in there as well.
[3:17:18.560 --> 3:17:22.560]  Why don't they just put the statins in the water or something?
[3:17:22.560 --> 3:17:25.200]  A lot of people have said that and they are in the water, in fact.
[3:17:25.200 --> 3:17:28.000]  That would be a communist plot, just like fluoride it.

[3:18:32.960 --> 3:18:37.680]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that you have
[3:18:37.680 --> 3:18:42.240]  greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's
[3:18:42.240 --> 3:18:47.040]  because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.

[3:19:37.200 --> 3:19:41.600]  9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from
[3:19:41.600 --> 3:19:46.240]  the New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by
[3:19:46.240 --> 3:19:54.000]  you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR? The day that we stop asking questions
[3:19:54.000 --> 3:19:59.600]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years
[3:19:59.600 --> 3:20:08.080]  after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place. An inside job? How dare
[3:20:08.080 --> 3:20:14.880]  you? If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:20:14.880 --> 3:20:19.760]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth,
[3:20:19.760 --> 3:20:24.720]  in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11. Truth rises. Download the

[3:21:45.280 --> 3:21:53.600]  My sales guy brought me some Chinese food. I hadn't eaten yet. This late in the day and I
[3:21:53.600 --> 3:22:00.640]  dumped a bunch of this hot mustard on it and ate it. I felt like my head was going to explode the
[3:22:00.640 --> 3:22:06.000]  last four days, but I ate a lot of hot stuff. I just poured mustard on it and just eating it.
[3:22:07.360 --> 3:22:14.720]  I started watering, head popped. I feel like a million dollars. Awesome.
[3:22:14.720 --> 3:22:24.640]  Awesome. Oh, man. I have got to, I just, I just kiss a little thing of mustard. I got to start.
[3:22:25.680 --> 3:22:29.360]  I mean, if it comes back tomorrow or something, the sinus pressure, I'll just eat some more of this.
[3:22:30.160 --> 3:22:34.160]  Man, that took care of that. Man, now I feel like ratting and raven.
[3:22:36.480 --> 3:22:40.400]  All right, that's mindless talk radio. Just a new little wives tale there for you,
[3:22:40.400 --> 3:22:45.840]  but it certainly worked for me. Okay, we just played that clip where they're giggling and
[3:22:45.840 --> 3:22:52.800]  laughing about putting, I've got to turn the ringer off over here. It's like an insane asylum around
[3:22:52.800 --> 3:23:03.760]  here. We forgot to, I want to play the end of that clip last 20 seconds again, John, from CNBC
[3:23:03.760 --> 3:23:11.760]  with the headline up on prisonplanet.com. CNBC host recommends statins to be put in the water.
[3:23:11.760 --> 3:23:14.000]  Play just the end of that again so people can hear it.
[3:23:14.720 --> 3:23:15.200]  Over.
[3:23:16.880 --> 3:23:22.640]  You're going to say not only check my HDL and LDL, make sure they put HSCRP in there as well.
[3:23:22.640 --> 3:23:26.720]  Why don't they just put the statins in the water or something?
[3:23:26.720 --> 3:23:31.200]  A lot of people have said that and they are in the water. In fact, that would be a communist plot
[3:23:31.200 --> 3:23:40.880]  just like fluoride. See how it's real funny. Let us now continue with your phone calls.
[3:23:41.760 --> 3:23:46.880]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in Indiana. Jason, thank you for holding.
[3:23:48.560 --> 3:23:49.680]  Hey, Alex. Hi.
[3:23:52.160 --> 3:23:57.600]  I think something that's going to happen in the future is I don't know if this is happening
[3:23:57.600 --> 3:24:04.320]  in other states, but the governor of Indiana wants to privatize local government.
[3:24:04.320 --> 3:24:10.000]  But again, that isn't real local government. That's making your cities private corporations
[3:24:10.880 --> 3:24:17.280]  the same thing that was done in Argentina and Brazil. When the bankers bankrupt you,
[3:24:17.280 --> 3:24:22.000]  they get the cities tricked into investing most of their money into the stock market.
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:27.120]  Then it implodes and the private corporations come in and become the government.
[3:24:27.120 --> 3:24:34.880]  And then they double, triple, quadruple basic services overnight. This is about raping. Go ahead.
[3:24:34.880 --> 3:24:40.560]  Yeah, it's a Colonel Shepard's report and they want to deal with local governments and they want
[3:24:40.560 --> 3:24:45.680]  an elected officials and they want to appoint sheriffs and stuff. And like small town people
[3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:50.960]  are kind of related and stuff and they could kind of talk, you know, some crazy going on.
[3:24:50.960 --> 3:24:54.240]  Well, they just appoint all these people, you know, they ain't going to give a crap.
[3:24:54.240 --> 3:24:57.920]  Here's another example. Schwarzenegger and Bloomberg
[3:24:59.520 --> 3:25:06.320]  got the proposition passed in California to where the legislature doesn't choose the districts now.
[3:25:06.320 --> 3:25:10.800]  Now, obviously there was corruption, gerrymandering, the way they drew the districts,
[3:25:10.800 --> 3:25:18.880]  but at least it was the people's representatives were doing it. Now, a board randomly selected by
[3:25:18.880 --> 3:25:27.360]  the governor randomly selected will decide that again, everything is about taking the power
[3:25:27.360 --> 3:25:32.720]  away from the county, away from the city, away from the state, away from the Congress.
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:40.800]  Tell me about your town. Yeah, it's just a lot of people's this real small town and people's
[3:25:40.800 --> 3:25:45.280]  related and if they need something weird was going on, they'd probably try to help people out.
[3:25:45.280 --> 3:25:49.680]  But if, you know, they appoint all these people, heck, if you don't know who they're appointed,
[3:25:49.680 --> 3:25:54.480]  it's probably much easier for them to try this. And how they do it is they say,
[3:25:54.480 --> 3:25:57.840]  let us take over your water district, let us take over your police department, let us take
[3:25:57.840 --> 3:26:05.200]  over the whole town and we'll cut prices by 20%. What you don't read is that two to three to four
[3:26:05.200 --> 3:26:12.320]  years in, they can quadruple prices, tell the people to read the contract. But it's the local
[3:26:12.320 --> 3:26:17.280]  city officials being paid off. They know it's a scam. They know what's going on. This is happening
[3:26:17.280 --> 3:26:23.680]  everywhere, sir. This is again, just like they're stealing trillions a month out of the treasury.
[3:26:24.320 --> 3:26:29.440]  In tax money, we got to pay back. They're robbing everything. That's what this is about. Yeah,
[3:26:29.440 --> 3:26:33.360]  I figured it's happening in other states, too. I didn't have to specifically, though, this is
[3:26:33.360 --> 3:26:36.880]  something we should do an article about. I mean, the New York Times has done reports about it and
[3:26:36.880 --> 3:26:43.520]  said how wonderful it is, but we should do our own reports or other radio host or other websites
[3:26:43.520 --> 3:26:50.000]  should do it. What specifically is happening in your town? I just know people that works in a
[3:26:50.000 --> 3:26:54.480]  like the courthouse and stuff and they're talking about how this is, you know, how this is a bad
[3:26:54.480 --> 3:26:57.920]  thing. And I think they should like try to petition that they're probably going to do no good.
[3:26:57.920 --> 3:27:01.360]  Well, yeah, I mean, why don't they, well, because they're trained to think we just have to let them
[3:27:01.360 --> 3:27:05.600]  do it. Stay there. I'm going to skip this segment, skip this break behind the scenes for the prison
[3:27:05.600 --> 3:27:10.160]  planet dot TV viewers, because I want to hear everything you know about this particular town
[3:27:10.160 --> 3:27:14.560]  you're in. What's happening? I mean, I know it's going on, but it's good for listeners
[3:27:14.560 --> 3:27:19.760]  to hear it brought home to them. Just we've nothing we can do. This corporation's now the boss.
[3:27:19.760 --> 3:27:28.800]  Hello. Here's my farm. We're okay. Let me go back to let me go back to Jason. Where are you in
[3:27:28.800 --> 3:27:39.200]  Indiana? Uh, in a southern Indiana and for sales. And tell us what's happening. I just I just know
[3:27:39.200 --> 3:27:44.560]  that, uh, that I got a friend that works in the courthouse and they're all talking, you know,
[3:27:44.560 --> 3:27:49.120]  they're all freaking out kind of because they heard about this current current shepherds report.
[3:27:49.120 --> 3:27:58.480]  And that, uh, they're going to, uh, try to, you know, in about a year or so, he got elected to
[3:27:58.480 --> 3:28:02.560]  our vote against him because I heard about all this, but that they're going to try to, uh,
[3:28:02.560 --> 3:28:08.000]  you know, privatize all the, you know, just, and that privatize the local government and just
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:12.480]  bring in their own people and probably be much easier for them to, they haven't done it yet,
[3:28:12.480 --> 3:28:17.360]  but I think it's something. And again, you've got lots of boss hog corrupt little towns,
[3:28:17.360 --> 3:28:25.120]  but then the people sometimes even get fooled and think, oh, we'll just hire a new company.
[3:28:25.680 --> 3:28:32.720]  But the reason the boss hog little towns do this is they get promised to, to, they're the ones that
[3:28:32.720 --> 3:28:39.760]  are going to get the jobs over it. You understand? So, so whereas there was government before,
[3:28:39.760 --> 3:28:45.280]  they weren't allowed to openly steal. That's how this works. Most of these companies are German,
[3:28:45.280 --> 3:28:51.760]  Dutch, Japanese, Arab, the other foreign British, Israeli, but, but, but mainly European. You see
[3:28:51.760 --> 3:28:59.520]  that a lot. They come in and then they hire the local boss hogs to do this and the boss hogs for
[3:28:59.520 --> 3:29:04.320]  a big payment. And it'll be right out in the open corrupt. I mean, the company will, you know, pay
[3:29:04.320 --> 3:29:12.080]  400 grand, uh, consulting for boss hogs wife and then promise boss hog that he's going to get the
[3:29:12.080 --> 3:29:16.960]  contract to manage all of this. And then boss hog says, absolutely. And the public doesn't know
[3:29:16.960 --> 3:29:25.280]  what's going on. Public has no idea, but go ahead. Yeah, I just, I think he's sold roads off and
[3:29:25.280 --> 3:29:32.800]  everything to foreigners and everything. It's just, it's sad. Again, if you study the Indiana,
[3:29:33.600 --> 3:29:39.840]  the New Jersey, the Texas cases, those companies don't even really pay for the road.
[3:29:39.840 --> 3:29:47.840]  They'll pay say in Texas a billion bucks to get $400 billion in roads over 20 years.
[3:29:49.120 --> 3:29:55.120]  I mean, pull the numbers up. It's even worse than that. They are given everything. All they do is buy
[3:29:55.120 --> 3:30:03.200]  off the politicians and then it's given to them, but then our cops will still write tickets and
[3:30:03.200 --> 3:30:10.640]  feed on the public and we'll still pay tax money. And then in the Texas and Indiana deals, we even
[3:30:10.640 --> 3:30:16.640]  have to pay to upkeep the roads. See, we pay for everything. The private corporations get all the
[3:30:16.640 --> 3:30:28.480]  money. It's not privatization. It's mass stealing. Get ready. I appreciate your call. Oh yeah,
[3:30:28.480 --> 3:30:33.600]  they're going to take, they are taking everything. In fact, there's not much left right now, but the
[3:30:33.600 --> 3:30:43.760]  public will find out. Here we go. For those that don't know how government works, a lot of people
[3:30:43.760 --> 3:30:49.280]  think it's cute and funny to kill Iraqis. They think it's cute and funny to engage in all this
[3:30:49.280 --> 3:30:54.960]  tyranny. They think they're part of the establishment. They think they're part of the system. They think
[3:30:54.960 --> 3:31:01.600]  that they get power through George Bush or through Barack H. Obama. They think they're part of the
[3:31:01.600 --> 3:31:08.080]  system and they have no idea that ruthless cunning people are in control. I mean, over three million
[3:31:08.080 --> 3:31:15.200]  Iraqis are dead in the 18 years of occupation. Iraq's been bombed and occupied and under siege
[3:31:15.200 --> 3:31:26.080]  and under embargo and under blockade for 18 years. 18 years. Now, just since the liberation,
[3:31:26.080 --> 3:31:29.600]  around a million and a half are dead, according to Lancet and all the other big medical journals
[3:31:29.600 --> 3:31:35.920]  that have independently gone over there and done those reports. Over a million and a half,
[3:31:35.920 --> 3:31:41.600]  million and a half killed before that. Iraq was 25 million people. It's 20 million now. You're
[3:31:41.600 --> 3:31:46.720]  going, well, wait a minute. You said three million are dead. That would be 22 million. Now, two million
[3:31:46.720 --> 3:31:52.160]  others are refugees and have left. Thank God they got out with their lives and you sit there and go,
[3:31:52.960 --> 3:31:57.440]  because I see the YouTube comments when they're shooting kids or blowing cars off the roads and
[3:31:57.440 --> 3:32:01.920]  you see the troops with their handles. You can go to their own websites, their own YouTube pages,
[3:32:01.920 --> 3:32:06.160]  because I'll click. I'll go, is that really a troop? And I'll click it and I'll be on the site
[3:32:06.160 --> 3:32:11.600]  with his own videos and they'll be like, hell yeah, you got to kill these scum and show them who's
[3:32:11.600 --> 3:32:19.040]  boss, these sand inwards. You know, you got to, you haven't seen this stuff, Paul? You haven't seen
[3:32:19.040 --> 3:32:25.120]  the videos of the GIs laughing and just machine gunning whole families? You haven't seen the video
[3:32:25.120 --> 3:32:30.880]  of the contractors just sitting off the highway, shooting up family cars while people stumble
[3:32:30.880 --> 3:32:37.280]  out dead, falling out dead. Have you seen them kill the puppy? Have you seen them shoot dogs?
[3:32:37.280 --> 3:32:41.440]  Have you seen them hang grenade sheep and families? You seen them beat little kids up
[3:32:42.400 --> 3:32:46.560]  till blood's pouring out their head? Oh yeah, have you seen them run over family cars for fun
[3:32:46.560 --> 3:32:52.080]  and make fun of the family while they cry with their car smashed by Abrams? Well,
[3:32:52.080 --> 3:33:02.000]  I can show it all to you right now. The point here is that that was all condoned and sanctioned.
[3:33:02.800 --> 3:33:09.200]  In fact, the Pentagon has had to admit now that they gave them manuals telling the troops how
[3:33:09.200 --> 3:33:16.880]  to have drop guns, that when you grease a whole family, you just drop a drop gun. Now,
[3:33:16.880 --> 3:33:24.400]  do you think the New World Order cares about you anymore than they care about those Iraqis?
[3:33:26.560 --> 3:33:30.480]  I haven't know the New World Order's mentality. I've studied them. They actually respect those
[3:33:30.480 --> 3:33:35.360]  ancient cultures and they respect those people. That's why they're killing them. They want them
[3:33:35.360 --> 3:33:38.800]  out of the way. They want them under control. They respected the Serbs. That's why they took
[3:33:38.800 --> 3:33:44.640]  them down. They do not respect you. They think, but see, you don't get a glorious death being
[3:33:44.640 --> 3:33:50.160]  machine-gunned where you can tell it's a crime. You get injected with mercury. You get fed fluoride.
[3:33:50.160 --> 3:33:56.560]  You get sprayed. You get to die and take your kid and bury him in the ground with all the onset of
[3:33:56.560 --> 3:34:02.240]  juvenile cancer. It used to be incredibly rare. Just 50 years ago, they'd take all the medical
[3:34:02.240 --> 3:34:06.400]  students in and show them a kid who had cancer with the Harvard Medical Wing and they thought it
[3:34:06.400 --> 3:34:15.600]  was like a one-horned, one-eyed, flying purple people eater. Now it's like just everywhere. Mass
[3:34:15.600 --> 3:34:20.880]  death, mass carnage. Go look at the numbers for yourself. See, you're getting it too. The same
[3:34:20.880 --> 3:34:26.080]  lovin'. Just go ahead and roll your eyes and laugh. Everything I'm telling you is true.
[3:34:27.920 --> 3:34:32.160]  The only reason I'm alive is because they don't want to make me a martyr and draw attention to me.
[3:34:32.160 --> 3:34:38.000]  And because there's a lot of people in government who are good. You're like, well, wait a minute,
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:44.240]  I thought the government's evil. At the top, the directives, the system is pure evil, but it's
[3:34:44.240 --> 3:34:49.200]  compartmentalized and they brainwash those beneath them and only give them pieces of the puzzle
[3:34:49.200 --> 3:34:57.040]  and convince them they're doing it for good. So if you think you're going to go kill Serbs
[3:34:57.040 --> 3:35:03.840]  and Iraqis and Afghans and that that's not going to come back on you and you can dehumanize them
[3:35:03.840 --> 3:35:08.560]  and that you won't be dehumanized, you've got nothing coming. All right, I've got to hurry here.
[3:35:08.560 --> 3:35:12.240]  I've got a lot of calls I want to get to. Real fast. Chris and Canada, go ahead.
[3:35:15.520 --> 3:35:20.960]  Hello? Yes, sir. Yeah, I'd like to say thanks for all the enlightenment. You know, it's just amazing
[3:35:21.520 --> 3:35:25.600]  the way this world is. Like, I've known something's been up for years, but to actually start
[3:35:25.600 --> 3:35:31.440]  connecting dots the last six months have been have been quite huge for for my wife and I for
[3:35:32.720 --> 3:35:36.560]  revelations and stuff. And the way the media isn't everything, everything you're saying is
[3:35:36.560 --> 3:35:42.960]  bang all the money. One great event that happened up here in Canada where where I lived that really
[3:35:42.960 --> 3:35:48.000]  opened our eyes was on the trucker and I'm up on top of the Pena Summit and I noticed the
[3:35:48.000 --> 3:35:53.600]  desire planes laying down chemtrails. I just recently started learning about chemtrails. This
[3:35:53.600 --> 3:36:01.280]  is in September here this year and this is 4,000 feet above sea level above the mountains between
[3:36:02.160 --> 3:36:08.160]  valleys or cities are. By the time these clouds get over above the Okanagan Valley where we live
[3:36:08.160 --> 3:36:14.320]  they look like high-series clouds and these particular two or three days they were laying
[3:36:14.320 --> 3:36:20.240]  them down heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy and within a couple of days in the valley you could barely see
[3:36:20.240 --> 3:36:27.600]  across the lake and just atrocious. And the news is saying it's smoke from the forest fires in
[3:36:27.600 --> 3:36:35.600]  Oregon. I can't smell any smoke. All my friends and relatives they they go I smell smoke a little
[3:36:35.600 --> 3:36:42.480]  bit the other day. Well I'll tell you what's incredible is that we've written articles where
[3:36:42.480 --> 3:36:48.320]  thousands of universities and government websites admit there is a huge global program
[3:36:48.320 --> 3:36:55.120]  to terraform the earth. They successfully report that they've dimmed the earth by 20% in the last
[3:36:55.120 --> 3:37:01.040]  decade. They admit the project started in 96. They admit they mix it with fuel. All these years we
[3:37:01.040 --> 3:37:06.960]  were called cooks and now they've just calmly come out in government textbooks, high school textbooks,
[3:37:06.960 --> 3:37:14.720]  they've calmly come out and said yes we are spraying you with barium and aluminum salts which
[3:37:14.720 --> 3:37:21.680]  are deadly folks again. Oh and and and and I mean again until 96 a trail would go over and it would
[3:37:21.680 --> 3:37:26.640]  disappear in a few seconds or a minute and you still see those trails right next to other jets
[3:37:26.640 --> 3:37:31.840]  laying down plumes that start falling towards you and there's no doubt they're spraying the
[3:37:31.840 --> 3:37:36.160]  living daylights out of us. And I'm a pilot. I know about airplanes. I know what it takes. I know
[3:37:36.160 --> 3:37:41.760]  altitude. I know the vector of airways up here and I'm a little embarrassed I hadn't noticed it
[3:37:41.760 --> 3:37:46.640]  earlier to the extent that it is but it was it's been particularly heavy this year. So I went on
[3:37:46.640 --> 3:37:52.720]  to the website for the Oregon Forest Service and at that time September 19th was the day that that
[3:37:52.720 --> 3:37:58.240]  I checked this out. It was posted that day. There was roughly 10 fires burning in the state.
[3:37:59.200 --> 3:38:03.920]  The largest one I believe was 75 acres but it leaves hectares. I know I have friends that
[3:38:03.920 --> 3:38:10.000]  have fought fires. 100 plus thousand hectares. So for 200,000 acres it doesn't create that much.
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:18.480]  Well the point is they admit they admit that they're doing all of this to us. They now admit it
[3:38:18.480 --> 3:38:22.960]  even when they admit they're getting rid of posicom and tautas. Even when they admit they're
[3:38:22.960 --> 3:38:27.440]  building FEMA camps even when they admit the private banks are setting up world government
[3:38:27.440 --> 3:38:33.600]  which they run. But for me the general public still can't believe it. This is just at the
[3:38:33.600 --> 3:38:37.280]  sheet. We are up here in Canada. It is just absolutely amazing what's happening right now.
[3:38:37.280 --> 3:38:43.280]  Me being a trucker. I go over to Alberta and all of a sudden I start hearing on the VHF radio
[3:38:43.280 --> 3:38:48.080]  saying what do you mean I can't get fuel in Red Deer? They go off Chevron and Petro is completely
[3:38:48.080 --> 3:38:54.880]  out. Red Deer north and they're rationing 400 liters per truck at the UFA card locks. I was
[3:38:54.880 --> 3:38:59.920]  in Caledars. I was able to get fuel. So for six weeks all the truckers in DC were like man grab
[3:38:59.920 --> 3:39:05.280]  your fuel now before you head out there and things like that. I'm sure you've heard about
[3:39:05.280 --> 3:39:11.280]  gasoline bombings. Oh yeah all those bombings up there. My buddies in Alberta in the northern
[3:39:11.280 --> 3:39:14.800]  oil sector aren't hearing much about this. They're claiming the natives are doing it.
[3:39:14.800 --> 3:39:19.040]  And us guys over here aren't hearing much about the fuel shortages in Alberta. You've got almost
[3:39:19.040 --> 3:39:24.000]  to be inside the local media groups. It doesn't get further. Even if you listen to CBC radio to
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:29.120]  your local radio a lot of the stuff is there locally but nowhere else. And there are little
[3:39:29.120 --> 3:39:35.120]  earrings because there's all local earrings. Real terrorism you never hear about. I mean if
[3:39:35.120 --> 3:39:39.440]  a real native group goes and starts blowing the pipeline up every week that shows action. That
[3:39:39.440 --> 3:39:42.720]  shows something that could really shut the new world order down. I'm not saying it's good. The
[3:39:42.720 --> 3:39:48.000]  point is real terrorism is ignored. Whenever they hype something you know it's staged.
[3:39:49.920 --> 3:39:54.240]  Listen I appreciate your call. I want to finish up with the calls but I want to
[3:39:54.240 --> 3:40:02.000]  play this YouTube clip that's also up on also up on prisonplanet.com right now. America being
[3:40:02.960 --> 3:40:07.200]  dumbed down. Let's go ahead and punch this up for me. And for prisonplanet.tv members they
[3:40:07.200 --> 3:40:14.640]  can watch this right here. I want to go ahead and play this clip for everybody because it has a
[3:40:16.800 --> 3:40:21.760]  it's a good compilation. It's a good compilation. So I'm going to play this and we're going to come
[3:40:21.760 --> 3:40:28.720]  back and take a few final calls if we have time. We're developing a society because of all of
[3:40:28.720 --> 3:40:34.320]  these different toxins known to affect brain function. We're seeing a society that not only
[3:40:34.320 --> 3:40:40.960]  has a lot more people of lower IQ but a lot fewer people of higher IQ. In other words a
[3:40:40.960 --> 3:40:47.760]  dumbing down a chemical dumbing down of society. So everyone's sort of mediocre. That leaves them
[3:40:47.760 --> 3:40:54.400]  dependent on government because they can't excel. We have these people of lower IQ who are totally
[3:40:54.400 --> 3:41:00.000]  dependent and we have this massive people who are going to believe anything they're told because
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:07.280]  they can't really think clearly. And very few people of very high IQ who have good cognitive
[3:41:07.280 --> 3:41:14.800]  function who can figure this all out and that's what they want. So you know you can kind of piece
[3:41:14.800 --> 3:41:20.880]  it together as to why are they so insistent in spending so many hundreds of millions of dollars
[3:41:20.880 --> 3:41:32.320]  of propaganda money to dumb down society. This is a I think that this bomber isn't Al Qaeda isn't
[3:41:32.320 --> 3:41:38.960]  anything like that. It's more he's more like it's a man. He's more like those 9-11 was an inside job
[3:41:38.960 --> 3:41:45.680]  kind of guys. They protesting in a violent way but in a violent way almost like the eco-terrorists
[3:41:45.680 --> 3:41:49.920]  but they don't intend to inflict casualties. They do it in the middle of the night. He's making
[3:41:49.920 --> 3:41:53.520]  a political point. They couldn't kill people with it had it been in the day but they choose to do it
[3:41:53.520 --> 3:41:57.120]  at 3 a.m. The cops have to go over there and we just talked to the commissioner. He used to go over
[3:41:57.120 --> 3:42:02.240]  and said does that camera store have a security camera? Hey can we see that? There's no master grid
[3:42:02.240 --> 3:42:06.480]  of all the cameras. A lot of politicians and I know you talk about that issue all the time.
[3:42:06.480 --> 3:42:10.720]  I think people should be careful what they wish for on China. If China were to revalue its currency
[3:42:10.720 --> 3:42:15.840]  or China is to start making say toys that don't have lead in them or food that isn't poisonous
[3:42:15.840 --> 3:42:19.280]  their costs of production are going to go up and that means prices at Walmart
[3:42:19.280 --> 3:42:23.520]  here in the United States are going to go up too. So I would say China is our greatest friend right
[3:42:23.520 --> 3:42:29.040]  now. They're keeping prices low. Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two
[3:42:29.040 --> 3:42:37.040]  new studies in the general pediatrician and African American. Shut up. Shut up. Why did you have to
[3:42:37.040 --> 3:42:40.640]  tell them you were an atheist if you didn't have any trouble reading the oath? Why didn't you just
[3:42:40.640 --> 3:42:46.400]  shut up? What Jimmy Carter should do is privately give Mr. Bush's opinion and shut up publicly.
[3:42:46.400 --> 3:42:50.720]  That would be best for the country. And it is our duty as loyal Americans to shut up
[3:42:50.720 --> 3:42:56.560]  once the fighting begins. Once the war against Iran begins we expect every American to support
[3:42:56.560 --> 3:43:01.600]  our military. And if they can't do that, just shut up. Can I just ask a question? Sure. What is
[3:43:01.600 --> 3:43:06.880]  Fox News? It's just a parade of propaganda, isn't it? It's just a festival of ignorance.
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:12.320]  Why a million people are dead in Iraq. Come on, this is ridiculous. What's the point of this?
[3:43:13.360 --> 3:43:20.880]  This is insane. I love Fox News. Go outside. Go hug your children. You should be more worried.
[3:43:20.880 --> 3:43:26.640]  Love your family. All the news you can at Fox News.
[3:43:31.600 --> 3:43:36.400]  At the start you were listening to a medical doctor get into fluoride,
[3:43:37.680 --> 3:43:43.280]  aspartame. This is on a mercury. Get them when they're young.
[3:43:43.280 --> 3:43:54.560]  Many infectious diseases can be brought completely under control when vaccination
[3:43:54.560 --> 3:43:59.760]  against them is practiced universally. We want people to be more educated because we don't
[3:43:59.760 --> 3:44:06.000]  feel like the truth is being told about the Marisol and about vaccines and about
[3:44:06.640 --> 3:44:12.880]  what the harm that it's doing to our children. People have to realize that these flu vaccines
[3:44:12.880 --> 3:44:18.400]  contain thimerosal. Thimerosal is a mercury preservative which has been directly linked
[3:44:18.400 --> 3:44:23.040]  to the autism epidemic that we have seen burst onto the scene over the past 10,
[3:44:23.040 --> 3:44:29.440]  15 years. Dr. Kurt Wooler believes the preservative is fueling a sharp rise in autism.
[3:44:30.400 --> 3:44:38.480]  One in 5,000 children had the developmental disorder in the late 1980s. Now one in 166
[3:44:38.480 --> 3:44:44.560]  kids lives with autism, an increase in the amount of thimerosal injected into their bodies.
[3:44:44.560 --> 3:44:49.920]  Dr. Boyd Haley is a mercury poisoning expert at the University of Kentucky.
[3:44:49.920 --> 3:44:56.080]  He believes it is possible thimerosal could be responsible for neurological brain damage,
[3:44:56.080 --> 3:45:00.560]  especially for children who don't naturally get mercury out of their system.
[3:45:00.560 --> 3:45:05.040]  It's one of the most toxic compounds I know of. I mean I can't think of anything that's
[3:45:05.040 --> 3:45:10.240]  absolutely more lethal. You can see that in this University of Calgary experiment.
[3:45:10.240 --> 3:45:16.960]  Mercury quickly destroys this neuron. It's really medical insanity. Just still allowing
[3:45:16.960 --> 3:45:22.880]  this neurotoxin that has damaged thousands and thousands of kids. I can't tell you, I'm really
[3:45:22.880 --> 3:45:28.480]  sick and tired of seeing one kid after the next come through my office who I know,
[3:45:28.480 --> 3:45:34.080]  clear cut, has been damaged by thimerosal in their vaccines. Thimerosal is a preservative.
[3:45:34.080 --> 3:45:39.040]  It's been in vaccines for decades, so literally hundreds of millions of people have received
[3:45:39.040 --> 3:45:45.200]  thimerosal. As it turns out, we are injecting our children with 400 times the amount of mercury
[3:45:45.200 --> 3:45:51.680]  that FDA or EPA consider safe. A child on his first day that he's born is injected with a
[3:45:51.680 --> 3:46:00.000]  hepatitis B shot under EPA guidelines. He would have to be 275 pounds to safely absorb that shot.
[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:06.240]  For years, science didn't support suspicions about the preservative, but recently the National
[3:46:06.240 --> 3:46:14.160]  Autism Association used CDC's own data to conclude children are 27 times more likely to develop
[3:46:14.160 --> 3:46:20.320]  autism with exposure to mercury-containing vaccines. 99% of the public really doesn't even realize
[3:46:20.320 --> 3:46:24.800]  that mercury is being used as a preservative in the vaccinations that they're taking themselves
[3:46:24.800 --> 3:46:30.960]  and giving their children. So in essence, you know, they're just blindly lining up to get flu shots.
[3:46:37.520 --> 3:46:41.520]  Okay, I'm going to come back in the final segment and finish the last few minutes. I don't know
[3:46:41.520 --> 3:46:46.960]  about that time to get to the other callers. Who knows? I go into overdrive today. You know,
[3:46:46.960 --> 3:46:54.720]  I could do more than four hours. You could always do that, but I did want to tell you about a couple
[3:46:54.720 --> 3:47:00.720]  sponsors before we, and I'm actually going to take calls just for the InfoWars audience during
[3:47:00.720 --> 3:47:04.960]  the break that's coming up, because I don't want these people to sit on hold. But before we do
[3:47:04.960 --> 3:47:12.080]  that, I do want the listeners to check out the folks at newvitality, newvitality.com.

[3:48:10.880 --> 3:48:20.640]  1-800-569-4056. I'm going to come back and finish up with this video. America being dumb
[3:48:20.640 --> 3:48:28.960]  down low and no IQ, but we're going to go ahead and skip this break for the info wars listeners,
[3:48:28.960 --> 3:48:35.600]  stay with us. Man, I'm going to be ready to get out of here when the show's over,
[3:48:35.600 --> 3:48:39.200]  with this cold doing the show. I'm not trying to whine. I just, if I seem kind of like I'm out of it,
[3:48:39.200 --> 3:48:45.680]  that's why listeners, but people seem to like the show today. So, you know, do what?
[3:48:45.680 --> 3:48:55.120]  I can't hear you. It doesn't matter. Who's up next here? I guess Michelle in Chicago.
[3:48:55.120 --> 3:48:59.280]  Oh, she dropped out. Next up is Andrew. Andrew in Wisconsin. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:49:03.040 --> 3:49:06.880]  Go ahead, Andrew. All right. How are you doing, Alex? Good, man. Go ahead.
[3:49:07.440 --> 3:49:14.080]  All right. Hey, I wanted to encourage you. I've been in ministry for around 20 years,
[3:49:14.080 --> 3:49:19.600]  and it's very discouraging. Like I hear you talk about many of the ministries and congregations.
[3:49:19.600 --> 3:49:24.000]  They don't have a clue what's going on, but one thing I want to encourage you. Are you familiar
[3:49:24.000 --> 3:49:34.400]  with God TV? It rings a bell. Tell me about it. Well, God TV is a booming network around the world
[3:49:34.400 --> 3:49:40.960]  that started in the UK, and it's becoming very, very popular around the world. And America came
[3:49:40.960 --> 3:49:46.080]  here a couple of years ago, and they are actually now starting to expose the new world order. So,
[3:49:46.080 --> 3:49:52.480]  it's really exciting. What's the name of the channel? Yeah, if you go to god.tv,
[3:49:53.920 --> 3:50:00.400]  that's their website. And I haven't been able to watch it myself too much, but a friend of mine
[3:50:00.400 --> 3:50:07.200]  said that they're very much exposing everything right now. Well, I'll have to check it out. I
[3:50:07.200 --> 3:50:11.680]  know on Dish Network and some other channels, there are some Christian channels that have like
[3:50:11.680 --> 3:50:16.160]  David J. Smith on and stuff about the new world order. We're not really a religious show. So,
[3:50:16.160 --> 3:50:20.720]  I know I'll be on those, but I am looking at some Dish Network and others to do my once a week TV
[3:50:20.720 --> 3:50:25.280]  show. We're working on that right now to get that all finished up. But we've got all our other
[3:50:25.280 --> 3:50:30.240]  duties. We've got to continue while we're doing that, but we're going to do it. So, that is all
[3:50:30.240 --> 3:50:35.600]  being developed right now. Anything else? Well, a friend of mine, after his election, they have
[3:50:35.600 --> 3:50:40.720]  been knowing him for around 20 years. He called me up and he said, I can't take it anymore. I need
[3:50:41.920 --> 3:50:47.840]  some answers. I need to know where to go. No more rush and no more Sean Kennedy. And so,
[3:50:47.840 --> 3:50:53.840]  I told him about GCN, and now he's addicted to the Alex Jones show. So, as long as he doesn't
[3:50:53.840 --> 3:50:58.560]  put you on the post, as long as he keeps his priorities in the right perspective. But I know
[3:50:58.560 --> 3:51:02.800]  that he'll do that. But I'm really glad to know that more and more people are waking up. Well,
[3:51:02.800 --> 3:51:08.080]  that's how it works. By you putting the word out about this show is how we reach more people.
[3:51:08.640 --> 3:51:14.560]  And yeah, with Russian, Hannity, I mean, Russia is still saying there's no world government and
[3:51:14.560 --> 3:51:18.720]  no new world order. When every world leader is calling for it and saying the banks are going
[3:51:18.720 --> 3:51:23.360]  to run everything. I mean, everything we said is happening. Everything we talked about is coming
[3:51:23.360 --> 3:51:28.160]  true. And all they can do is point at kooks in the alternative movement. There are plenty of those
[3:51:28.160 --> 3:51:33.360]  who talk about ridiculous stuff and try to get us through strawmen. I appreciate your call and take
[3:51:33.360 --> 3:51:42.240]  care. All right, real fast. Let's go to Jennifer in Delaware. I've been having to cut it off there
[3:51:43.120 --> 3:51:47.200]  with Carl and Canada and others. I want to finish up this this audio and video clip.
[3:51:48.640 --> 3:51:54.560]  Go ahead, Jennifer. Thanks for calling. Yes, I actually had a question on this year's election.
[3:51:54.560 --> 3:52:01.680]  I have a friend who's incarcerated and he told me that people came to them and told them that if
[3:52:01.680 --> 3:52:07.360]  they put if they vote for Obama, they put $100 on their books. And I wanted to know if this was
[3:52:07.360 --> 3:52:12.480]  going on in any other state. So if you heard anything about this, there has always been old
[3:52:12.480 --> 3:52:18.640]  fashioned democratic party machine buying votes, paying people to vote in dead people's names.
[3:52:18.640 --> 3:52:23.280]  You know, we always hear dead people voted. Yeah, living people go out with a list and they go around
[3:52:23.280 --> 3:52:30.400]  posing as that person. And yes, the democratic machine generally steals through voter fraud.
[3:52:30.400 --> 3:52:35.520]  And the Republicans are more masters at stealing at the top. That doesn't mean that both sides
[3:52:35.520 --> 3:52:42.000]  don't do both. But I didn't believe it when I heard it. Then I saw the video of the Black Panther
[3:52:42.000 --> 3:52:47.040]  standing outside a polling place with a night stick trying to intimidate whites. And yes,
[3:52:47.040 --> 3:52:50.800]  just because there's racist whites, you know, doesn't mean there's not racist blacks.
[3:52:50.800 --> 3:52:58.240]  Just so crazy that stuff went on like that. But if people think they're going to be saved,
[3:52:58.240 --> 3:53:02.720]  they think all their problems are solved. We've got to do anything to get Obama elected.
[3:53:04.960 --> 3:53:09.600]  Also, do you know what these vaccines are supposed to be for that are so mandatory?
[3:53:10.240 --> 3:53:15.120]  Well, none of them are mandatory. The whole issue is the government lies and says they are.
[3:53:15.120 --> 3:53:19.440]  But tell them to show you the law. They can't. I appreciate your call. I'm out of time. People
[3:53:19.440 --> 3:53:23.120]  can call me back tomorrow, of course. I'm going to play as much of this clip as I can. It's
[3:53:23.680 --> 3:53:31.200]  up on prisonplanet.com right now. But this is fluoride. Get them for life. We've gotten to
[3:53:31.200 --> 3:53:44.240]  that part of the video. Edward L. Bernays is regarded by many as the father of public relations.
[3:53:44.240 --> 3:53:50.880]  He was born in Vienna, Austria. Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud. Bernays pioneered the
[3:53:50.880 --> 3:53:58.240]  use of psychology and other social sciences to design public persuasion campaigns. He published
[3:53:58.240 --> 3:54:04.080]  several scholarly works still used in universities worldwide today. And he also spearheaded the
[3:54:04.080 --> 3:54:10.000]  national campaign to fluoridate the water supply of America through the fluoridationist of the
[3:54:10.000 --> 3:54:21.760]  public health service. This is one pollutant that we capture in the phosphate fertilizer
[3:54:21.760 --> 3:54:28.160]  industry. And having captured it, we can't dump it into the sea. But we put it into our own drinking
[3:54:28.160 --> 3:54:34.800]  water. It's extraordinary. What fluoride in our water supply is a very real and ever-present risk
[3:54:34.800 --> 3:54:39.200]  to our population at large. Dennis, let's make sure we're clear on this. Fluoride is in tea,
[3:54:39.200 --> 3:54:43.920]  it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste, but it's actually a poison, right?
[3:54:43.920 --> 3:54:49.440]  It sure is. And here's the quickest evidence. Go to your bathroom and pick up your toothpaste,
[3:54:49.440 --> 3:54:53.840]  and you'll see a warning that if a child swallows more than a pea-sized amount of
[3:54:53.840 --> 3:54:59.920]  toothpaste, call poison control. Wow. The protected pollutant status that fluoride
[3:54:59.920 --> 3:55:05.280]  enjoys with an EPA and other federal establishments is remarkable as the charts over here show.
[3:55:05.280 --> 3:55:11.760]  Last November, concerns over excess fluoride prompted the American Dental Association to warn
[3:55:11.760 --> 3:55:17.760]  parents not to mix baby formula with tap water during an infant's first 12 months.
[3:55:17.760 --> 3:55:24.960]  Phyllis Mullinix found that fluoride in very modest doses produces effects in laboratory
[3:55:24.960 --> 3:55:28.880]  animals resembling a tension deficit and hyperactivity disorder. He says,
[3:55:28.880 --> 3:55:33.760]  do you have any idea what you're saying? And he says, you're telling us that we're reducing
[3:55:33.760 --> 3:55:41.360]  the ITA children. And basically, I said yes. Scientists like Nobel Prize winner Arvid Carlson
[3:55:41.360 --> 3:55:46.640]  and a large group of EPA scientists have called for the banning of fluoride because we don't know
[3:55:46.640 --> 3:55:52.320]  how much we're ingesting, so we don't know if we're being poisoned. All right, folks. It's an
[3:55:52.320 --> 3:55:58.640]  important video, nice little 10-minute piece that somebody made on YouTube. Be sure and get it at
[3:55:58.640 --> 3:56:05.120]  www.prisonplanet.com. Get it out to everybody. God bless you all. Re-broadcast on the Internet starts now at infowars.com
[3:56:05.120 --> 3:56:11.120]  and jonesreport.com. And then I'll be back on the M&FMs all over the places they rear us and back tomorrow
[3:56:11.120 --> 3:56:15.200]  live 11 to 3. God bless you all. Thank you for joining in. Thank you for listening. Good job, John.
[3:56:16.000 --> 3:56:20.400]  I've called for the banning of fluoride because we don't know how much we're ingesting,
[3:56:20.400 --> 3:56:25.760]  so we don't know if we're being poisoned. All right, folks. It's an important video,
[3:56:25.760 --> 3:56:31.760]  nice little 10-minute piece that somebody made on YouTube. Be sure and get it at www.prisonplanet.com.
[3:56:31.760 --> 3:56:37.280]  Get it out to everybody. God bless you all. Re-broadcast on the Internet starts now at infowars.com
[3:56:37.280 --> 3:56:42.800]  and jonesreport.com. And then I'll be back on the M&FMs all over the places they rear us and back
[3:56:42.800 --> 3:56:56.800]  tomorrow live 11 to 3. God bless you all. Thank you, gentlemen.
