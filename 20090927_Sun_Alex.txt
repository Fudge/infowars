[00:20.720 --> 00:27.680]  you have found at the front lines of the information war as we attempt to alert
[00:27.680 --> 00:33.520]  humanity to the fact that a private consortium of banks merciless mega
[00:33.520 --> 00:38.360]  corporations are openly setting up world government that will be owned run
[00:38.360 --> 00:45.320]  controlled by them and it is a eugenics system they wish to enforce on the
[00:45.320 --> 00:50.000]  planet world government is only the beginning it is the means to their ends
[00:50.000 --> 00:59.680]  it is Sunday the 27th day of September 2009 I don't want to just come on the
[00:59.680 --> 01:07.120]  radio today and rant and rave at the police because I'm more than angry at
[01:07.120 --> 01:15.480]  them I am saddened that they continue to confirm that when they're under federal
[01:15.480 --> 01:21.600]  control they act as bad as communist Chinese police or as Hitler's police or
[01:21.600 --> 01:26.320]  as Stalin's police now all over European newspapers they are describing some of
[01:26.320 --> 01:31.800]  the events that happened at the G20 to some of the things we've seen in China
[01:31.800 --> 01:37.040]  similar to the July 4th protest known as Tiananmen Square but they weren't
[01:37.040 --> 01:44.800]  running over people with tanks yet Rob do one of the producers of this radio

[03:01.680 --> 03:06.960]  bullets being fired the sounds of gunshots and Jason was flabbergasted
[03:06.960 --> 03:13.200]  because they came on to a park that is on the grounds of the university
[03:13.200 --> 03:18.960]  bordering the university and it was mainly just college kids out there in
[03:18.960 --> 03:25.040]  the park and he said he couldn't believe it because there weren't even any
[03:25.040 --> 03:30.200]  protests going on and the police he saw them beating women men we have video of
[03:30.200 --> 03:34.880]  this in the head with belly clubs I mean blood spewing women would say I'm

[03:52.640 --> 03:58.280]  year olds covering their ears being hit with sound cannons the police have just

[04:02.720 --> 04:07.520]  enemy they've been militarized and the military fights and kills an enemy and

[06:00.400 --> 06:06.200]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[06:06.200 --> 06:12.760]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[06:12.760 --> 06:24.520]  I'm live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central standard time we
[06:24.520 --> 06:30.920]  come back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. central for an abbreviated broadcast okay we had
[06:30.920 --> 06:38.040]  one of our reporters Rob doob arrested but he was not charged they were letting
[06:38.040 --> 06:44.920]  the mainstream media out of the cordon at the city park bordering Pitt the
[06:44.920 --> 06:50.280]  university there in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and the suburbs and they
[06:50.280 --> 06:53.720]  looked at his press pass and just said no you're going to jail no one is allowed
[06:53.720 --> 06:57.800]  out on the streets in Pittsburgh and I even have a clip of Brian Williams of
[06:57.800 --> 07:03.120]  NBC saying yes the city's been cleared out for the g20 no one is allowed on the
[07:03.120 --> 07:10.320]  streets and it's got to be more than 50 sound cannon vehicles and we've got
[07:10.320 --> 07:14.880]  video of where you'll see 10 or more together just in one area and they would
[07:14.880 --> 07:20.280]  drive around through sparsely populated neighborhoods industrial areas the
[07:20.280 --> 07:23.800]  police would pull up when people were getting off work getting in their cars
[07:23.800 --> 07:29.120]  and just aim cannons at them and hit them and it's meant to be outrageous it's
[07:29.120 --> 07:34.560]  meant to be tyranny so that you know hey you live in a third-world police state
[07:34.560 --> 07:38.240]  now you are a slave the police have admitted it's been in the news in the
[07:38.240 --> 07:41.600]  last few years they wear black uniforms they wear black masks they wear the
[07:41.600 --> 07:48.640]  Darth Vader outfits for intimidation and they had the computerized broadcasting
[07:48.640 --> 07:56.120]  bull horns with the voice saying we're using less lethal weapons less lethal
[07:56.120 --> 08:00.040]  see that's the true name of non-lethal weapons because they can kill you rubber
[08:00.040 --> 08:04.960]  bullets kill people all the time sound cannons earplugs don't protect you it
[08:04.960 --> 08:10.880]  attacks the middle ear can cause deafness serious ear damage people die all
[08:10.880 --> 08:14.480]  the time being beaten to death by police and you can just search the term man
[08:14.480 --> 08:18.760]  dies for being beaten by police man dies for rubber bullets but the issue here
[08:18.760 --> 08:21.760]  is they would ride down neighborhoods and this is in the Associated Press this
[08:21.760 --> 08:26.200]  is not just Alex Jones saying this and but but we witnessed this we got video
[08:26.200 --> 08:29.320]  of it I've seen countless YouTube videos other people shot they would go
[08:29.320 --> 08:35.280]  into neighborhoods in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and there would be people on
[08:35.280 --> 08:37.840]  their front porches there'd be people getting out of their cars there'd be
[08:37.840 --> 08:42.080]  kids throwing footballs I mean there's photos and videos of this little kids I
[08:42.080 --> 08:46.800]  mean less than 10 years old and they would broadcast the state code they
[08:46.800 --> 08:50.280]  have a state Patriot actor that abolished their Bill of Rights few years
[08:50.280 --> 08:54.240]  ago is why Pennsylvania was chosen and then they just aim the cannon a little
[08:54.240 --> 09:00.680]  kid fire on them and the little kids crying on the ground and the police again
[09:00.680 --> 09:04.920]  I've passed anger with the police I understand sadists go into the police
[09:04.920 --> 09:10.760]  department and control freaks and bullies and thugs and sickos historically but I
[09:10.760 --> 09:14.000]  also understand that just a lot of former military people that are macho and
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.200]  their family or police and you know that there are some good police out there but
[09:18.200 --> 09:23.600]  normally in history in Mexico or Russia or China or Nazi Germany or Cuba about
[09:23.600 --> 09:28.280]  90% of the time countries are run by corrupt thug police and so for people
[09:28.280 --> 09:35.800]  to be in denial about this is really sad all the movies and the PR and the
[09:35.800 --> 09:39.000]  propaganda
[09:39.000 --> 09:50.120]  and the propaganda that we see just goes on and on and on that it just force fed
[09:50.120 --> 09:54.160]  us to worship the military worship police and now that all over the country
[09:54.160 --> 09:57.120]  they're running military checkpoints and pulling people out of their cars and
[09:57.120 --> 10:02.760]  looking for drunk drivers and looking for guns now newspapers write articles
[10:02.760 --> 10:08.440]  attacking me going Alex Jones hates our troops and that's kind of like if I was a
[10:08.440 --> 10:13.480]  German citizen in 1939 and I was criticizing Hitler with troops on the
[10:13.480 --> 10:19.240]  streets would that mean I hate the German military or hate the German troops I
[10:19.240 --> 10:22.760]  guess it would mean I hate what they're doing and hate what they've been turned
[10:22.760 --> 10:31.600]  into so in the final equation why is the system turning the police and military
[10:31.600 --> 10:35.440]  loose on the people why do they want you to be intimidated by them why do they
[10:35.440 --> 10:40.360]  want you to know their thugs why do they want you to know they're trampling the
[10:40.360 --> 10:46.400]  Constitution because 23.7 trillion and growing has been stolen in the last 10
[10:46.400 --> 10:51.920]  11 months and that's more than we could ever pay back it's all made up fiat
[10:51.920 --> 10:55.600]  money given to private banks they then loan it back to our own nation at
[10:55.600 --> 11:00.560]  interest and they're only getting started and they're announcing that they're
[11:00.560 --> 11:03.640]  going to go ahead and start killing old people cover to Newsweek the case for
[11:03.640 --> 11:08.200]  killing granny and they're announcing $15 million fines for garage sales if you
[11:08.200 --> 11:13.040]  sell any recalled products in the last decade and they're announcing no more
[11:13.040 --> 11:17.680]  farms or ranches that can have private sales of their food without government
[11:17.680 --> 11:22.360]  permits and they're announcing year-long public school where they're going to
[11:22.360 --> 11:26.100]  force your kids to go 12 months out of the year Obama says so total
[11:26.100 --> 11:30.280]  federalization they're announcing face scanning and license plate reading
[11:30.280 --> 11:33.760]  cameras that have already been put in everywhere tracking everybody and
[11:33.760 --> 11:38.560]  they're announcing that if you don't just spank your kids they're gonna take
[11:38.560 --> 11:40.920]  them if you yell at them they're gonna take them but then the state can do
[11:40.920 --> 11:45.640]  whatever it wants and they're just the state is run by criminal parasites and
[11:45.640 --> 11:50.360]  they're going to take everything we've got if we don't wake up and say no and
[11:50.360 --> 11:54.360]  they've militarized and brainwashed and dumbed down the police and military
[11:54.360 --> 11:59.840]  domestically they're having urban warfare drills all over the country the
[11:59.840 --> 12:03.720]  Marines the army but that's really a thing of the past before they would do
[12:03.720 --> 12:07.720]  the drills of taking over cities and towns and then say it was just a drill
[12:07.720 --> 12:12.640]  now they're kind of phasing out of those into just no we're just here we're just
[12:12.640 --> 12:19.240]  in your town 379,000 regular troops to be deployed to America and they admit
[12:19.240 --> 12:22.840]  their own homeland security documents that we of course have broken here that
[12:22.840 --> 12:27.960]  their number one enemy is gun owners veterans conservatives libertarians
[12:27.960 --> 12:33.080]  Ron Paul Bob Barr supporters they say having an American flag bumper sticker
[12:33.080 --> 12:36.880]  means you may be a terrorist you can go read the myac report go read the DHS
[12:36.880 --> 12:41.800]  reports we've released that good people in law enforcement I guess what you call
[12:41.800 --> 12:50.560]  the last vestiges of peace officers have sent us but we've had a slick
[12:50.560 --> 12:54.120]  corporate criminal group take over America and they want to turn us into a
[12:54.120 --> 12:59.960]  complete police state but what upsets me so bad is that I don't want to believe
[12:59.960 --> 13:05.560]  all this I don't want to be proven right to have Rob do and Jason Douglas and
[13:05.560 --> 13:08.720]  Jason Bernmuss tell me about what they saw to see all the countless YouTube
[13:08.720 --> 13:15.120]  videos uploaded by thousands of citizen journalists and others from the G20 in
[13:15.120 --> 13:20.440]  Pittsburgh and then to read the Associated Press where it admits families
[13:20.440 --> 13:25.560]  were driven out of their cars onto their front porches and then told they're not
[13:25.560 --> 13:28.840]  allowed to come out on the streets daytime nighttime curfew you're not
[13:28.840 --> 13:32.000]  allowed on the streets they kind of selectively but looks like you're going
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.120]  to work they leave you alone but they pull up to a nine-year-old kid and say
[13:35.120 --> 13:38.440]  go inside the little nine-year-old doesn't know so they swing your cannon
[13:38.440 --> 13:43.680]  around at 15 feet away and hit him right in the face in fact that photo is up on
[13:43.680 --> 13:50.760]  infowars we should pull that up I forget the headline Aaron posted it he's
[13:50.760 --> 13:54.040]  still here he can give that to you if you want I think it's something like
[13:54.040 --> 13:58.480]  Pittsburgh police terrorized public with sound cannons and it's got a bunch of
[13:58.480 --> 14:02.080]  videos on the page but it's a photo of this kid that's got to be eight nine
[14:02.080 --> 14:07.400]  maybe ten and he and there's videos of kids with their balls in their yard and
[14:07.400 --> 14:11.000]  they don't know why guys in black uniforms pull up in black vehicles it
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.800]  kind of looks cool to them and they say you know section this that you're not
[14:14.800 --> 14:18.680]  allowed to be on the street we're going to use non-lethal less lethal as the new
[14:18.680 --> 14:22.360]  term see first it's non-lethal now it's less lethal now they admit it can kill
[14:22.360 --> 14:27.400]  you and they had microwave cannons and almost no media is announcing though the
[14:27.400 --> 14:31.360]  sound cannons and microwave guns those are confirmed to be there we know the
[14:31.360 --> 14:35.400]  sound cannons were used hundreds of times I would just call my guys to get a
[14:35.400 --> 14:39.600]  report during the three days and I would routinely just hear sound cannons
[14:39.600 --> 14:43.640]  going off in the background and rubber bullets being fired yeah there it is
[14:43.640 --> 14:49.720]  little kid on the side of the street covering his ears and you see people in
[14:49.720 --> 14:52.600]  their windows covering their ears you know because they wonder what's going on
[14:52.600 --> 14:58.000]  and there's police driving around with the military we all paid for taxpayer
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.440]  money just psychopathically attacking everyone and then Brian Williams goes on
[15:02.440 --> 15:11.480]  NBC and Braggs yeah they will they clear the streets here also the majority of
[15:11.480 --> 15:15.640]  the protesters I've seen a lot of raw video now were tea party people in the
[15:15.640 --> 15:20.680]  Fed folks info wars comm banners turning response team shirts that was the
[15:20.680 --> 15:26.200]  majority there were maybe a hundred anarchists clearly protected by the
[15:26.200 --> 15:29.600]  police they would always heard the protest into an area wouldn't allow
[15:29.600 --> 15:32.840]  wouldn't permit them first they turn a right into a privilege by making it
[15:32.840 --> 15:36.960]  permitted and then after the police surrounded her by the anarchists will
[15:36.960 --> 15:40.640]  come out throw a few things they would then retreat and the police will then
[15:40.640 --> 15:46.000]  open fire but in many cases as the AP reports in the article civil liberties
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.040]  groups police overreacted at g20 when you read this article they admit that in
[15:51.040 --> 15:54.040]  many cases they would just go to the university where college kids were just
[15:54.040 --> 16:01.600]  outside at night and attack them and there's video of it hello this is Alex
[16:01.600 --> 16:05.640]  Jones with some important questions if you're going into a battle and they give

[20:13.560 --> 20:17.760]  speechless in the last four or five days watching hundreds of YouTube videos
[20:17.760 --> 20:22.720]  shot by different activist journalists mainstream media you name it it's because
[20:22.720 --> 20:26.840]  I can't even put into words what I've seen you can go to infowars.com and
[20:26.840 --> 20:30.960]  prisonplanet.com we had literally hundreds of them posted dozens and
[20:30.960 --> 20:36.280]  dozens of pages with each page as many as 10-15 videos and they went into the
[20:36.280 --> 20:40.320]  shopping districts and you see all these old women and tourists with their hand
[20:40.320 --> 20:43.640]  bags and they'll walk up to the police and say what's going on in the capsule
[20:43.640 --> 20:48.160]  hit them with their billy clubs and then big German shepherds biting women and
[20:48.160 --> 20:53.320]  blood pouring out of them I mean they're just nuts and folks the German
[20:53.320 --> 20:58.480]  people were some of the most moral hard-working in Europe in the 20s and
[20:58.480 --> 21:04.480]  30s they were much more moral than the average American is today we're pretty
[21:04.480 --> 21:09.800]  decadent and we think evil's cool and tough and look at how when their leader
[21:09.800 --> 21:15.120]  told them do all these evil things they did it and I know I get letters from
[21:15.120 --> 21:18.200]  police and emails every day and every time we open the phones up for just
[21:18.200 --> 21:21.720]  police they call in and drove they send us documents I know there are a lot of
[21:21.720 --> 21:28.280]  good police I wrecked a car one time drove through the edge of tornado blew me
[21:28.280 --> 21:32.280]  off the road in between Johnson City and Fredericksburg the two state policemen
[21:32.280 --> 21:36.840]  that came were big fans of the radio show told me about different shows they've
[21:36.840 --> 21:41.760]  listened to I run into police all the time I had police in LA come up on the
[21:41.760 --> 21:45.840]  street that were fans the last three times I've flown to Los Angeles on
[21:45.840 --> 21:53.120]  business consulting on Jesse Ventura's TV show that's coming up I would have
[21:53.120 --> 21:58.440]  the TSA leaving Austin and coming back from Austin say they were fans and ask
[21:58.440 --> 22:02.520]  for my autograph on two different occasions so I use that as a gauge that
[22:02.520 --> 22:08.840]  all the police and military aren't bad but what am I to think when the police
[22:08.840 --> 22:13.800]  three times we know of Thursday night when Wednesday night Thursday night and
[22:13.800 --> 22:19.240]  Friday night went on to pit because they said in the city and the suburbs no
[22:19.240 --> 22:22.920]  one is allowed on the streets day or night and they invoked some state
[22:22.920 --> 22:26.680]  emergency law you can hear them broadcasting it and and and people walk
[22:26.680 --> 22:29.320]  up to the police like the police are supposed to be human beings and they
[22:29.320 --> 22:35.840]  say what are you talking about this is the university and we're showing video
[22:35.840 --> 22:40.360]  right now the police dogs biting people and these old women these tourists say
[22:40.360 --> 22:45.360]  why are you letting the police dogs do this and they attack the old women I
[22:45.360 --> 22:52.640]  mean folks they were in mainline shopping districts mainline neighborhoods my
[22:52.640 --> 22:55.200]  guys would try to run away from the police when they were attacking small
[22:55.200 --> 22:59.200]  demonstrations they go down side streets they'd run for an hour and they go in a
[22:59.200 --> 23:04.040]  coffee shop and be waiting and shoot video of and we've got some of the stuff
[23:04.040 --> 23:08.440]  posted of armored vehicles just driving down the street randomly blasting
[23:08.440 --> 23:16.040]  neighborhoods it's just I can't believe the police are this bad and I know it's
[23:16.040 --> 23:19.480]  mob psychology they say you can take a lot of upstanding people and put them
[23:19.480 --> 23:23.240]  together in a mob situation or a wild situation will do bad things I
[23:23.240 --> 23:28.160]  understand adrenaline and I try to rationalize it it really freaks me out
[23:28.160 --> 23:31.880]  to my core it freaks me out that here in Austin they take blood without warrants
[23:31.880 --> 23:38.120]  you know it freaks me out that we're gonna be talking about all that with
[23:38.120 --> 23:42.160]  with Rob do who got arrested and Jason Burma's who was there with him and the
[23:42.160 --> 23:46.360]  lucrodosky coming up next hour but I need to shift gears into other subjects
[23:46.360 --> 23:52.800]  on Friday show I had Paul Hartman Google the term New World Order and click
[23:52.800 --> 23:56.920]  Google News and I counted up the stories there were a whole bunch of different
[23:56.920 --> 24:02.400]  blocks of stories that said 3,000 4,000 1,000 2,000 under the term New World Order
[24:02.400 --> 24:08.040]  just blocks of stories I checked it yesterday it was over 12,000 stories with
[24:08.040 --> 24:15.680]  the term New World Order in them the first block has 7,928 the second block
[24:15.680 --> 24:25.720]  has 144 you scroll down the second read the next block has 807 another block
[24:25.720 --> 24:32.800]  has 394 and if you count up the first page it's it's it's well over was well
[24:32.800 --> 24:36.120]  over 10,000 yesterday and looks like it's well over that today and these are
[24:36.120 --> 24:44.920]  new articles I went to my parents Friday because my kids were over there I
[24:44.920 --> 24:48.120]  wanted to visit everybody at once because I've been here working about 18
[24:48.120 --> 24:51.320]  hours a day I've been going home a lot lately I finished up follow the
[24:51.320 --> 24:55.480]  Republic my new film Friday and it's been sent to be mass produced now and my
[24:55.480 --> 24:59.120]  mother walks in and says look at this front page of the statesman today and it
[24:59.120 --> 25:03.200]  was the Austin American statesman I'll give the prison planet TV viewers a look
[25:03.200 --> 25:10.840]  at this it says New World Order g8 up to g20 and they announced the New World
[25:10.840 --> 25:15.760]  Order now now what does this New World Order mean all these years I would talk
[25:15.760 --> 25:18.400]  about the New World Order and people would laugh at me I was just reading
[25:18.400 --> 25:24.480]  Club of Rome CFR World Bank IMF documents and they said we're gonna
[25:24.480 --> 25:28.880]  bankrupt the world by design we're gonna set up a new global currency based on
[25:28.880 --> 25:34.800]  carbon credits in Ron actually came up with this latest plan 12 years ago and
[25:34.800 --> 25:37.840]  I've got the congressional hearings on that Al Gore admitting and he was
[25:37.840 --> 25:40.480]  involved in it back when he was in the White House that's in fall the
[25:40.480 --> 25:45.520]  Republic and they it's all a big joke to them they're gonna home inspect you
[25:45.520 --> 25:50.560]  tax track everything you do I mean this is hell on earth and they're openly in
[25:50.560 --> 25:54.080]  the next two years they've announced at the last three G20s this year that
[25:54.080 --> 25:58.240]  they're gonna phase out the dollar and that's all we have left as the dollar
[25:58.240 --> 26:01.680]  they're talking about basically devaluing it by two-thirds and then you'll have a
[26:01.680 --> 26:05.840]  new global SDR currency bank-to-bank you'll still have your regional and
[26:05.840 --> 26:10.560]  national currencies but they'll be set not by your Treasury Department but by
[26:10.560 --> 26:15.240]  the private source consortium of banks that that then give their orders of the
[26:15.240 --> 26:19.760]  G20 that makes up all the finance ministers of the 20 industrialized and
[26:19.760 --> 26:26.560]  quote rich nations as the G20 calls itself so my message to all the yuppies
[26:26.560 --> 26:32.400]  and people that don't care and aren't involved and aren't informed we don't
[26:32.400 --> 26:35.840]  have time to screw around anymore you need to find out about world government
[26:35.840 --> 26:39.200]  and how we're being conquered by a private consortium of banks you need to
[26:39.200 --> 26:42.760]  find out what they have in store for you because I talked to a lot of people that
[26:42.760 --> 26:47.720]  think they're part of the establishment and are on power trips they don't know
[26:47.720 --> 26:51.360]  what's going on but they say so what world government's the next step well
[26:51.360 --> 26:56.000]  even if you think that's the case this is an authoritarian tyrannical world
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.520]  government that doesn't like your standard of living and doesn't want you to be
[27:00.520 --> 27:04.280]  able to have children and openly states that they're drugging your water and
[27:04.280 --> 27:08.040]  your food in the air and that they're sterilizing us and then all the numbers
[27:08.040 --> 27:11.960]  show this I mean it is a fact that the new flu vaccine has squailing the
[27:11.960 --> 27:15.200]  adjuvant that the military stopped giving its troops because it was killing
[27:15.200 --> 27:21.080]  them it's a fact it's got five times the highest previous level of mercury
[27:21.080 --> 27:26.480]  ever seen in a vaccine that's mainstream news my kids play with
[27:26.480 --> 27:29.920]  neighbor kids and about a week and a half ago I noticed that two different
[27:29.920 --> 27:32.800]  groups of neighbor kids had that were showing off that they'd gotten the flu
[27:32.800 --> 27:37.320]  shot not even the H1N1 but the regular and then in the last two days over the
[27:37.320 --> 27:39.880]  weekend when I'm home a few hours playing with my kids in the front yard
[27:39.880 --> 27:43.640]  and backyard and neighborhoods neighbor kids come over and I say where's your
[27:43.640 --> 27:48.440]  sister where's your brother and they say oh they're sick in bed and I go oh
[27:48.440 --> 27:52.040]  really how long they've been sick all about a week and a half now you could
[27:52.040 --> 27:55.920]  say that circumstantial but I see the kids get the shot and now they're in the
[27:55.920 --> 28:01.320]  bed sweating bullets a week and a half later and I see the numbers on children
[28:01.320 --> 28:05.200]  getting cancer up several thousand percentage points and I have top
[28:05.200 --> 28:10.200]  scientists on and major German newspapers like build the biggest newspaper in
[28:10.200 --> 28:12.960]  Germany are reporting that there are cancer viruses and all the major
[28:12.960 --> 28:18.640]  vaccines that are causing cancer and I just want to warn people and I can't
[28:18.640 --> 28:22.680]  even I can't even get over the comfort zone I don't want to get in my
[28:22.680 --> 28:26.080]  neighbor's business I don't want to bring him a packet of info and try to say
[28:26.080 --> 28:30.040]  please don't shoot your kids up with with 60-something vaccines by the time
[28:30.040 --> 28:34.000]  they're five years old and over a hundred by the time they're 12 and now
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.880]  they want you to take three flu vaccines full of mercury and you can search
[28:37.880 --> 28:42.160]  the studies out mainline university studies three flu shots doubles your
[28:42.160 --> 28:45.520]  chances of Alzheimer's and now 20-year-olds are getting Alzheimer's

[33:23.760 --> 33:26.920]  made a good point when I was over my parents house Friday they said I guess
[33:26.920 --> 33:30.360]  this is the coming out of the New World Order because we've seen hundreds of
[33:30.360 --> 33:34.160]  articles in one day announcing global government into the dollar the end of
[33:34.160 --> 33:39.960]  America's power but we've never seen it five thousand ten thousand twelve thousand
[33:39.960 --> 33:45.480]  articles in one day every major newspaper announcing it and they're
[33:45.480 --> 33:50.560]  explaining to people what the New World Order is and what it means ladies and
[33:50.560 --> 33:54.440]  gentlemen private banks through fraud came in got control of our Treasury
[33:54.440 --> 33:58.840]  departments in the western world issued themselves unlimited currency and credit
[33:58.840 --> 34:04.120]  under our name bought up the planet and so you've got these swindlers up there
[34:04.120 --> 34:08.320]  and every time they show up in England they beat a newspaper delivery got a
[34:08.320 --> 34:11.120]  death and then tried to cover it up later the videos got released they killed
[34:11.120 --> 34:13.800]  him beating to death he was like I'm delivering newspapers they said no one
[34:13.800 --> 34:17.960]  allowed the streets and beating to death that's what Tiananmen Square is when
[34:17.960 --> 34:21.840]  they just said all over Pittsburgh no one is allowed to be out including kids
[34:21.840 --> 34:25.720]  in their front yards a miles and miles away from the convention center they
[34:25.720 --> 34:30.080]  would go to the university at night and there's videos of university kids
[34:30.080 --> 34:34.920]  coming out of dorms coming out of the university centers you know but dates
[34:34.920 --> 34:38.880]  they're not even protesters and they walk up and go officer why are you pepper
[34:38.880 --> 34:42.560]  spraying us why are you and they will just hit them and there's video of them
[34:42.560 --> 34:45.320]  running up to a woman knocking her off her bike she gets up says why are you
[34:45.320 --> 34:49.120]  doing this the cops hit her again with Billy clubs so she throws her bike at
[34:49.120 --> 34:55.280]  them they beat the hell out of her and I mean this is so unlawful this is such
[34:55.280 --> 35:00.800]  criminal behavior this is a police riot when they're beating women up and then
[35:00.800 --> 35:03.360]  you're supposed to just sit there and take it while they beat you up for their
[35:03.360 --> 35:08.120]  own personal enjoyment but they were clearly ordered to do this and again
[35:08.120 --> 35:12.120]  AP don't believe Alex Jones there's a lot of AP articles that are actually
[35:12.120 --> 35:16.200]  accurate there's a crazy Reuters article saying no arrests were made total
[35:16.200 --> 35:20.480]  live we're gonna go over that but it says civil liberties groups police over
[35:20.480 --> 35:25.920]  reacted at G 20 and then it describes people in their neighborhoods being
[35:25.920 --> 35:29.400]  driven to their home people being attacked on their porches children being
[35:29.400 --> 35:35.440]  attacked there's video of old women being attacked with police dogs and being
[35:35.440 --> 35:39.440]  bitten and women walking out of stores with bags going what's going on
[35:39.440 --> 35:43.520]  officer and they're like because they've always wanted to be able to attack the
[35:43.520 --> 35:49.280]  public they've always wanted to have a bloody psycho riot and the same thing
[35:49.280 --> 35:53.040]  happened in Germany same things happen everywhere else we know psychology we
[35:53.040 --> 35:57.520]  know what armies do the mass raping the killing of the this this this evil
[35:57.520 --> 36:01.120]  spirit that comes over them and that's why you don't want the military or
[36:01.120 --> 36:04.600]  militarized police in your country that's why the Constitution and Posse
[36:04.600 --> 36:09.360]  commentators say it's illegal but they just ignore all of that so we have all
[36:09.360 --> 36:14.160]  of this happening and now Obama's announcing he wants a 12 month school
[36:14.160 --> 36:20.240]  year they in New Jersey are not apologizing for the new Obama curriculum
[36:20.240 --> 36:25.520]  where they have the kids change the verse from Jesus loves all the children
[36:25.520 --> 36:29.360]  to Obama loves all the children red yellow black and white they are all
[36:29.360 --> 36:33.080]  equal in the president's site we played that Friday we broke that a month ago but
[36:33.080 --> 36:37.640]  now lump limbaugh and Hannity and drudge you got it last week and we've got
[36:37.640 --> 36:42.960]  scores of these videos and I'm not bragging that we keep breaking it but I am
[36:42.960 --> 36:47.000]  honored that we're actually driving the news now that that that that what we
[36:47.000 --> 36:51.560]  cover then later becomes mainstream media that's the real value of this radio
[36:51.560 --> 36:56.920]  show is that we can drive things out into the public consciousness to have a
[36:56.920 --> 37:01.320]  wider debate about them now I want to get a statement from both you and we're
[37:01.320 --> 37:04.560]  going to play some exclusive audio and video here of your arrest that's what
[37:04.560 --> 37:09.400]  this video is and we're going to go over a lot of other a lot of this video we
[37:09.400 --> 37:14.440]  can't play this one doesn't have cussing right yeah which was took Burma's
[37:14.440 --> 37:18.120]  Burma's was up here like five six hours last night I was up here till about 2 30
[37:18.120 --> 37:20.880]  in the morning I came back here at noon okay so you've been working all day just
[37:20.880 --> 37:25.040]  to cut the cuss words out mainly the police screaming and cussing and but
[37:25.040 --> 37:30.440]  first I want to get in summation what you witness Rob do with the military and
[37:30.440 --> 37:33.200]  police attacking the American people and then the big news I haven't even
[37:33.200 --> 37:37.880]  announced I barely mentioned it earlier because if police dogs attacking old
[37:37.880 --> 37:41.360]  women isn't enough if little kids playing football in their front yard in the
[37:41.360 --> 37:44.400]  middle of a neighborhood being attacked it from 10 feet away point blank
[37:44.400 --> 37:47.720]  round range with sound cannons that do damage the middle ear and can cause
[37:47.720 --> 37:53.240]  permanent deafness isn't enough Luke Radowski was arrested was charged was
[37:53.240 --> 37:57.560]  taken to the penitentiary with you he said the military was holding him they
[37:57.560 --> 38:01.960]  they stripped him down made fun of his neck and body beat him with Billy
[38:01.960 --> 38:05.280]  clubs saying you're the big TV star this will teach you a lesson and then
[38:05.280 --> 38:08.680]  handcuffed him in violation of the Geneva Convention while he was in the
[38:08.680 --> 38:13.240]  cell and he's and you said you were in there doing that was just people bloody
[38:13.240 --> 38:18.400]  some people that Burma's was telling me some people so bloody they couldn't even
[38:18.400 --> 38:21.680]  get up and again most of these were college students because the police
[38:21.680 --> 38:24.920]  couldn't find anyone that wasn't submitting so they would go into
[38:24.920 --> 38:27.520]  neighborhoods and tackle women they would go into shopping areas and
[38:27.520 --> 38:31.840]  tackle women small children and I and it's more than just anger I am
[38:31.840 --> 38:36.000]  physically nauseous and I know you are so do give us your bull down the whole
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.600]  event your arrest what you witnessed thank God they drop charges on you they
[38:40.600 --> 38:45.720]  have it on Luke and and then we'll get Jason Bermas's take on this it was just
[38:45.720 --> 38:52.600]  a total ridiculous show of force coming from the police and just going after
[38:52.600 --> 38:56.000]  people we're in this neighborhood of Lawrenceville the first day that riots
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.120]  started happening and they had sound cannons that they were shooting in
[38:59.120 --> 39:02.560]  these neighborhoods I would say by the time they brought him in the second
[39:02.560 --> 39:06.200]  time we it was after the first time we broke it on the air and then the second
[39:06.200 --> 39:10.560]  time they did it there was there in a neighborhood and it's where two streets
[39:10.560 --> 39:13.840]  meet up people are coming out looking what's going on why are you know why
[39:13.840 --> 39:17.720]  there's so many cops here there's maybe 20 people Luke was out there with his
[39:17.720 --> 39:23.400]  with his his little sound cannon I guess you could call it but he was he was you
[39:23.400 --> 39:26.400]  know saying why are you doing this we're your brothers were your sisters and they
[39:26.400 --> 39:29.000]  would they would just keep playing the thing over and over again the sound you
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.920]  know you need to leave the city of police or as chief of police has said
[39:33.920 --> 39:37.320]  this is an unlawful gathering a lot of unlawful assembly and we're gonna play
[39:37.320 --> 39:41.200]  that letter and they keep saying this is a less lethal weapon that was the true
[39:41.200 --> 39:44.760]  name in the 60s when they invented them because rubber bullets can kill you
[39:44.760 --> 39:48.640]  microwave guns can kill you so now first they tell you it's not only
[39:48.640 --> 39:52.320]  another saying no we may go ahead and kill you pretty much and they turn that
[39:52.320 --> 39:55.800]  thing on and people would run with their ears covered run from the cannon
[39:55.800 --> 39:58.800]  people they were turned but it goes through your skull and people keep
[39:58.800 --> 40:02.120]  saying they'll put earplugs in that does nothing I don't think it does because I
[40:02.120 --> 40:05.640]  saw that's how it works and they were I mean any time they would turn that on
[40:05.640 --> 40:09.320]  I have the guy aiming it at people I was behind him I was up on a roof shooting
[40:09.320 --> 40:13.680]  that stuff and it was it was total terrorism on their side well we have
[40:13.680 --> 40:17.560]  some photos and videos of little kids but but but Douglas had to get back to
[40:17.560 --> 40:20.440]  his family today but he's gonna upload the video tomorrow and he'll be on the
[40:20.440 --> 40:24.320]  show as the other fellow from our office that went with you and he said
[40:24.320 --> 40:28.040]  repeatedly they would people would come out on their front porches and they
[40:28.040 --> 40:31.840]  would aim it at them yeah I mean the cops are just that is so criminal it's
[40:31.840 --> 40:34.960]  with glee and they I think they really liked it because you try to talk to
[40:34.960 --> 40:37.440]  these people when you're up close to them and they didn't want to have anything
[40:37.440 --> 40:40.480]  to do the bankers are gonna love taking everything they've got oh yeah go ahead
[40:40.480 --> 40:43.920]  officers take all the shots trust the government and let me tell you when we
[40:43.920 --> 40:48.080]  were detained in prison arrested whatever whatever we want to call it these
[40:48.080 --> 40:51.520]  pot-bellied mindless people walking around with their paperwork just
[40:51.520 --> 40:56.000]  disgustingly fat it was it was kind of funny to watch because these people
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.000]  don't know what's in store for them they really don't they're gonna get you know
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.880]  they're gonna get cancer they're gonna die and they're gonna get beaten down and
[41:01.880 --> 41:05.080]  it's gonna be funny when it happens to them although I shouldn't say that but
[41:05.080 --> 41:08.720]  I think they don't know the White House admits their poison water in the
[41:08.720 --> 41:12.200]  vaccines they don't they don't know this is that's why they can't have children
[41:12.200 --> 41:15.520]  they don't know why that's where buddy they knows dying at 35 a cancer right
[41:15.520 --> 41:19.640]  and to them it was left right Alex we get escorted out to the bathroom and
[41:19.640 --> 41:21.960]  they're like well where are you guys protesting I said I was just there
[41:21.960 --> 41:27.040]  covering it as press I said but what you guys did was a total ridiculous show of
[41:27.040 --> 41:30.920]  force there was maybe 300 people there you had 1200 cops and then half the
[41:30.920 --> 41:35.240]  people you arrested her kids are like oh oh yeah well that's just their liberal
[41:35.240 --> 41:38.360]  you know it was all liberal to them these these liberals we need to take care of
[41:38.360 --> 41:41.280]  myself what does that mean and and then they start talking about how they would
[41:41.280 --> 41:44.480]  go to the teabag things and so it's total left right to them they think it's
[41:44.480 --> 41:47.760]  left but wait a minute I've seen the video of Gadsden flags and info war
[41:47.760 --> 41:51.520]  shirts mm-hmm from the videos I've seen it looks like a large portion of it was
[41:51.520 --> 41:54.760]  our listeners and people chained in the Fed and we got a lot of in the Fed chance
[41:54.760 --> 41:59.200]  going on it so here's the cops attacking in the Fed people that a week
[41:59.200 --> 42:02.360]  before we're at tea parties with them exactly and that because they don't know
[42:02.360 --> 42:05.680]  the difference they think there is two sides and there isn't there's the
[42:05.680 --> 42:09.880]  American people and there's tyranny and what we witnessed and what we felt was
[42:09.880 --> 42:13.240]  total tyranny well you were handcuffed you were taken to jail you were told
[42:13.240 --> 42:15.960]  you were arrested so that is an arrest when you're pulled over that's a that
[42:15.960 --> 42:21.080]  that that's detainment but but Luke was charged now now Luke told Burma's what
[42:21.080 --> 42:24.240]  happened him he's coming up later in the next hour but tell us what Luke told you
[42:24.240 --> 42:28.320]  well basically he was taken to state prison whereas the hundreds so
[42:28.320 --> 42:32.240]  protesters that they took with you were in a you were in a big room right and
[42:32.240 --> 42:35.200]  they were all you said you were with Luke in jail at first yeah we're with Luke
[42:35.200 --> 42:38.000]  they had us they wouldn't let us talk they had National Guard tell us don't
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.440]  talk look straight ahead don't talk looks present but bags over your heads yeah
[42:41.440 --> 42:44.720]  exactly and then we were outside and they brought us out in the cold we were
[42:44.720 --> 42:47.800]  sitting there and it started to drizzle and then we see Luke and about five
[42:47.800 --> 42:51.160]  other guys bring bring them out and sometimes they were letting people go
[42:51.160 --> 42:54.480]  early and they were handcuffed in the front well Luke and the five other guys
[42:54.480 --> 42:57.520]  they was with they were all handcuffed in the back so we knew I was talking with
[42:57.520 --> 43:01.640]  Daniel and that's because Luke tried to have you heard that millionaire

[47:24.840 --> 47:28.720]  stories of them torturing people on the ground handcuffed people with pepper
[47:28.720 --> 47:33.840]  spray up with the with the tear gas yeah after after they had us I get on the
[47:33.840 --> 47:37.480]  our knees there there was another group of students laying down I was near Luke
[47:37.480 --> 47:41.400]  and Daniel from We Are Changed and there's one other guy and I because I
[47:41.400 --> 47:44.840]  tried to get out show my press pads and they weren't having that they pushed me
[47:44.840 --> 47:49.720]  back in told me to get down for my safety and so and they tried to take my
[47:49.720 --> 47:53.080]  camera to and I grabbed that back from put it in the bag closed it up left it
[47:53.080 --> 47:56.200]  running and then I look over and there's a bunch of kids laying down and these
[47:56.200 --> 47:58.960]  are college students there weren't flip-flops they're not out there running
[47:58.960 --> 48:01.520]  from the cops and they're spraying them down with pepper spray because again
[48:01.520 --> 48:05.000]  this parks there on the edge of the university yeah it was it but up right
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.320]  right up to the 10 o'clock at night yes the dorm rooms are right there and
[48:08.320 --> 48:11.360]  that's where the police can find somebody who's out sure so they're like
[48:11.360 --> 48:15.080]  hunting for any slave that there comes out under the martial law and one guy
[48:15.080 --> 48:18.160]  showed me his text that he got it said escalation that they get from the
[48:18.160 --> 48:22.200]  university so they went out to see what was going on so you know they get this
[48:22.200 --> 48:25.440]  text says escalation him and his brother and out there is these two twin
[48:25.440 --> 48:28.720]  brothers and they're you know they're gonna take pictures of it but they get
[48:28.720 --> 48:31.760]  out there cops shove them and throw them in and then I heard some some people
[48:31.760 --> 48:34.880]  saw some news reports they actually went into the dorms after people looking for
[48:34.880 --> 48:41.360]  people so now you can't even be in your dorm in America well that's al-Qaeda so
[48:41.360 --> 48:44.840]  they were why were they spraying the people with tear gas that were on the
[48:44.840 --> 48:47.600]  ground I guess so they would submit but I mean pretty much when you're laying on
[48:47.600 --> 48:49.880]  the ground I don't know how much more submission you can do unless you're
[48:49.880 --> 48:52.360]  well they're not going to submit till they go into the gas chamber for the
[48:52.360 --> 48:55.880]  safety deal I'll sing yeah exactly well after they beat the young gentleman on
[48:55.880 --> 49:00.040]  the bike and it's on the video it's up at the Alex Jones channel right now you
[49:00.040 --> 49:03.000]  know the guy the kid finally got his bike back they just broke his knuckle
[49:03.000 --> 49:06.440]  you can hear him in the background saying you just broke my knuckle it's
[49:06.440 --> 49:10.760]  still not enough the guy just shoots off the pepper spray I'm lucky I didn't get
[49:10.760 --> 49:13.640]  I was about ten feet away from the whole thing basically I heard the guy
[49:13.640 --> 49:18.120]  screaming and I'm trying to watch my back not get arrested still get this on
[49:18.120 --> 49:23.120]  tape they beat this kid he's got a peace flag wrapped around maybe 120 pounds
[49:23.120 --> 49:27.040]  maybe and he reaches down to go get his bike they're hitting the bike they
[49:27.040 --> 49:31.440]  break his knuckle he grabs it back pepper spray again they're launching
[49:31.440 --> 49:36.280]  tear gas canisters I was in touch with Cindy Sheehan and a gentleman named
[49:36.280 --> 49:39.360]  Josh throughout the entire thing they're texting me they're letting off
[49:39.360 --> 49:42.920]  tear gas canisters everywhere they've cordoned off all of Oakland and again
[49:42.920 --> 49:47.960]  this is right around the university the end of the video is just another bystander
[49:47.960 --> 49:52.200]  that got so caught up in this by accident that he took the tear gas his
[49:52.200 --> 49:55.040]  whole face is beat red they have to bring him to the hospital I mean he's
[49:55.040 --> 49:59.320]  literally being brought by two of his friends well the issue here is just like
[49:59.320 --> 50:02.560]  China or Russia they're setting the precedent to do this to the American
[50:02.560 --> 50:07.640]  people in the whole world sees us I mean AP admits that they were attacking
[50:07.640 --> 50:10.960]  people's homes people in their front porches in broad daylight all over the
[50:10.960 --> 50:15.840]  two cities Oakland and Pittsburgh itself I want to go to this video and audio
[50:15.840 --> 50:20.200]  here in just a moment first time it's ever been seen of during your arrest
[50:20.200 --> 50:24.160]  and also some cut-ins of what happened to Jason Burma's but I want to point out
[50:24.160 --> 50:27.480]  that at the same time you've got world leaders meeting saying the end of the
[50:27.480 --> 50:31.480]  dollar calling for global government calling for global carbon taxes Al
[50:31.480 --> 50:36.040]  Gore's they're running around doing all of this and the police are just frothing
[50:36.040 --> 50:39.920]  to show off to the world leaders and and Friday night the world leaders have
[50:39.920 --> 50:43.320]  already left it's over they're marching down to the university to hopefully
[50:43.320 --> 50:47.080]  find somebody who's out at night yeah yeah and then you know that's that's the
[50:47.080 --> 50:51.080]  real issue you watch my video and I start off with how many protesters there
[50:51.080 --> 50:55.400]  are there are not that many then I cut to how many police there are I'm in
[50:55.400 --> 51:00.240]  essentially a you know a nine-tenths empty park then it did the park is nine
[51:00.240 --> 51:04.600]  tenths empty and I am by myself just trying to get things on film I'm chased
[51:04.600 --> 51:08.040]  down I'm about to be arrested dogs are barking at well that's why they're
[51:08.040 --> 51:12.040]  passing laws for $15 million fines for garage sales and and SWAT teaming
[51:12.040 --> 51:15.960]  farmers that sell eggs on the side of the road we are the slaves we are the
[51:15.960 --> 51:19.960]  producers we are the people and they've they've stolen tens of trillions
[51:19.960 --> 51:23.400]  they're getting us ready to be squeezed to pay all these new taxes to the new
[51:23.400 --> 51:27.720]  bank of the world this is our submission this is teaching us to be slaves
[51:27.720 --> 51:32.280]  teaching us to capitulate teaching us to have a broken back a broken mentality
[51:32.280 --> 51:36.000]  we are being brought into bondage you gentlemen agree I agree and I you know I
[51:36.000 --> 51:39.720]  think the people that I was with they all look broken these young kids I don't
[51:39.720 --> 51:43.640]  see them ever protesting again I think that well that's the message is that
[51:43.640 --> 51:47.240]  like five years ago in Portland they came up to a permitted protest and
[51:47.240 --> 51:50.400]  sprayed babies and baby carriages there's video of this and the mother said
[51:50.400 --> 51:53.240]  you just sprayed my two-year-old he goes listen you effin bleeper you
[51:53.240 --> 51:57.240]  shouldn't bring a baby to a protest and so this listen don't worry the police
[51:57.240 --> 51:59.880]  are going to be judged by their own government they're going to be judged
[51:59.880 --> 52:03.200]  by the vaccines they trust they're going to be judged with their bank account all
[52:03.200 --> 52:06.680]  of you people that serve this evil system and enjoy what you're doing you
[52:06.680 --> 52:10.480]  have no idea what you're part of you have no idea how real this is just like
[52:10.480 --> 52:16.640]  German soldiers and German police in 1937 had no idea and once you feel it you
[52:16.640 --> 52:20.760]  will believe it you will and once you're in once you're in the middle of that a
[52:20.760 --> 52:24.520]  mixture and you're trying to say hey you know you shouldn't be beating little
[52:24.520 --> 52:29.800]  kids boom you're in the system and that's it and I digital finger printed
[52:29.800 --> 52:33.080]  now I mean no charges against them but we'll just take your digital finger
[52:33.080 --> 52:36.440]  and every time we called to try to get information on this and oh no there's a
[52:36.440 --> 52:40.320]  different process for protests yeah well that that's official oppression what
[52:40.320 --> 52:42.920]  they did to you well remember what we haven't even told the listeners what
[52:42.920 --> 52:47.960]  happened when you got there I tell you guys okay defense link put a press
[52:47.960 --> 52:51.320]  release out they say this is where the press is to speak to the military you
[52:51.320 --> 52:54.440]  pull up to speak to them they say oh we're not gonna talk to the media come
[52:54.440 --> 52:58.440]  back tomorrow right and after we waited for 20 minute because you call me on the
[52:58.440 --> 53:01.240]  cell I try to talk to him yeah and then they call the police and say we have
[53:01.240 --> 53:04.480]  people sneaking around the perimeter videotaping trying to stage a terror
[53:04.480 --> 53:07.640]  attack to the front gate no I don't know then I call the cops up and I go did you
[53:07.640 --> 53:10.280]  call my guys and say they're on a terror list for us their lives and the
[53:10.280 --> 53:14.440]  guys laughing going yeah I mean just like like we don't eat but see no judge no
[53:14.440 --> 53:18.000]  jury right you're just on a terror list this is the end of America and they're
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.240]  now saying if you're on that terror list over 25,000 people added a month you
[53:22.240 --> 53:26.200]  aren't doubled on a firearm no judge no jury no due process so all of you people
[53:26.200 --> 53:29.120]  out there on the left and right don't want to serve this system you're now
[53:29.120 --> 53:32.440]  going to be punished well we're going to go out with this video and audio a
[53:32.440 --> 53:36.480]  Friday night when you got arrested and then we're going to come back with it
[53:36.480 --> 53:40.600]  and then Luke Radowski's coming up stay with us

[57:19.360 --> 57:23.000]  right here is a shot of Luke Rudowski again saying that if someone were to
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.360]  break a window or start a fire he would be the one to put it out or he would be
[57:26.360 --> 57:30.240]  the one to stop it trying to tell these I mean you're looking at hundreds of
[57:30.240 --> 57:33.680]  police officers information right now and maybe a couple dozen you notice it's a
[57:33.680 --> 57:42.000]  few anarchists show up to yell and stuff as the pretext well it is a crime to
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.960]  attack innocent people and to say they can't defend themselves we'll be right

[1:02:55.320 --> 1:02:59.480]  telling people not to break things we were exposing agent provocateurs those
[1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:02.920]  anarchists that were destroying Pittsburgh we'll tell them that we were
[1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:05.880]  gonna stop them from doing this and we were telling the police officers to
[1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:10.800]  uphold their own to the Constitution it was surreal seeing thousands and thousands
[1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:16.120]  of police officers in martial law stormtrooper uniforms Billy clubbing
[1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:21.040]  people I got Billy clubbed I got tear gas they used found wave weapons against

[1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:30.200]  going through the detention centers by the National Guard the FBI was there
[1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:35.280]  taking everybody's information and then they singled me out and leave my camera
[1:03:35.280 --> 1:03:40.040]  died we are changed Chicago they sent us to state prison out of 500 people who
[1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:44.640]  are arrested we were the few people sent to state prison and now I am faced with
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:48.920]  two charges against me I have to go back to Pittsburgh this Wednesday to face a
[1:03:48.920 --> 1:03:54.600]  judge against how they set us up they lied blatantly to all the people there

[1:04:07.840 --> 1:04:10.720]  were making the thousands of demonstrators look bad they look like
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:14.920]  informants we caught them in Denver mainstream Denver post they were feds we
[1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:19.080]  caught them in Canada last year they're getting caught in England do you believe
[1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:22.560]  these were Asian provocateurs I definitely believe that because these
[1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:26.560]  people had no common sense or rationale and we were there speaking out against
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:31.120]  today and most of the good people there were feeling and clapping every time I
[1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:35.240]  said you know don't let these anarchists make all of us look bad we have to fight
[1:04:35.240 --> 1:04:38.520]  for the minds and hearts of the people and not break their property and that's

[1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:31.040]  looked at carried the headline New World Order it's all happening ladies and
[1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:36.040]  gentlemen and I saw headlines about global summits happening in Canada where
[1:06:36.040 --> 1:06:41.240]  they said it'll be Chinese style control no free speech no banners no marches no
[1:06:41.240 --> 1:06:44.240]  permitted marches the government permitted they turn a right into a
[1:06:44.240 --> 1:06:49.840]  privilege one march for the G20 and then they wouldn't allow them to march then
[1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:53.520]  they went into neighborhoods they stopped anybody on their front porches this
[1:06:53.520 --> 1:06:59.320]  was about the government knowing that the American people are the lowest form
[1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:03.160]  of scum and that we're here to pay taxes take their vaccines drink their
[1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:10.840]  fluoride water and shut up and again we have to get notice the tea parties in
[1:07:10.840 --> 1:07:14.200]  San Diego they have the sound weapons out there that's what North comms for
[1:07:14.200 --> 1:07:18.840]  that's what Homeland Security's for they tell you it's for al-Qaeda al-CIA to but
[1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:21.520]  that's a CIA creation it's for the American people
[1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:27.120]  lucradowski of we are change just just a great patriot if you watch my film
[1:07:27.120 --> 1:07:30.840]  truth rising you'll see New York police saying his backpacks a bomb his
[1:07:30.840 --> 1:07:34.440]  camera's a gun they say we know it's not a gun or a bomb but we're gonna say it
[1:07:34.440 --> 1:07:37.760]  isn't arrest you this is the type of stuff you go through in America where
[1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:42.320]  police will frame you on video and are so criminal and evil they think it's
[1:07:42.320 --> 1:07:46.400]  normal remember Dallas Texas they just randomly pull cars over throw bags a
[1:07:46.400 --> 1:07:50.240]  chalk in the back and then take your car and home the government is rogue and
[1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:55.200]  criminal and we better wake up to the fact that this happens in every other
[1:07:55.200 --> 1:07:58.880]  society and country but Americans can't believe it's happening here it is
[1:07:58.880 --> 1:08:02.320]  happening here look from everybody I talked to they got arrested including
[1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:08.320]  Rob do you got it the worst of anybody and so did Red Cross medic people but
[1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:11.760]  they were protecting the anarchist the few dozen they clearly had hired now we
[1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:16.640]  proven this in Denver in Canada I keep repeating that mainstream news to the
[1:08:16.640 --> 1:08:20.880]  Obama deception the extras where they admit the police poses anarchist in
[1:08:20.880 --> 1:08:24.920]  Greece they got caught this year posing attacks and that was on national
[1:08:24.920 --> 1:08:28.000]  Greece television why did they do that because they want to shut down free
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:32.080]  speech and demonstrations in America Obama says he wants to shut down web
[1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:35.320]  freedom the Austin police chief saying he wants to go out people that criticize
[1:08:35.320 --> 1:08:38.920]  him now I've had him in studio but I mean it you know he seems like a nice
[1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:42.480]  guy but he's got warrantless checkpoints taking blood now I mean this
[1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:46.480]  country's going to hell in a hand basket Luke Radowski tell folks what
[1:08:46.480 --> 1:08:50.200]  happened to you blow-by-blow what you saw the first three days and then what
[1:08:50.200 --> 1:08:56.000]  happened to you Friday mostly Friday we were out there meeting outside Pittsburgh
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  University where students were gasped the night before and we were there
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:03.520]  talking to the police officers and a huge crowd of everybody just gathered
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:07.160]  around us because they were loving about what we were saying about all these
[1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:11.920]  agent provocateurs making everybody look bad I'll tell the police officers you
[1:09:11.920 --> 1:09:14.800]  know you guys are brothers and sisters there's no reason why you should be
[1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:18.000]  fighting each other there's no reason why you should be attacking us and
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:22.200]  letting a small group of people dictate how you react to us and the message was
[1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:25.040]  getting out to a lot of people that's what we've been doing throughout this
[1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:29.440]  whole g20 just talking to the police officers and talking to the people there
[1:09:29.440 --> 1:09:34.240]  and that's why when they arrested you and tortured you they singled you out and
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:37.560]  they said this in the jail system everybody that when I was being
[1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:40.680]  processed when I was sent to state jail everywhere I went I was like oh there's
[1:09:40.680 --> 1:09:44.560]  this this guy over here he's a major celebrities but on the news all the time
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:47.560]  as any and they've been making all these jokes about me they definitely
[1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:51.680]  signaled me out but my message was a message of reason trying to calm things
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:56.120]  down make everything peaceful and make sure nobody gets hurt and and I was out
[1:09:56.120 --> 1:09:59.680]  there everybody knew who I was all the police officers all that's why you're
[1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:03.800]  the only correction officers exactly and we were there speaking and then out of
[1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:07.920]  nowhere all these police officers come out of nowhere and they totally just
[1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:12.920]  engulfed the whole area and they block off all the perimeters they let us they
[1:10:12.920 --> 1:10:15.960]  told us to leave the park we left the park and we were talking to them like
[1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:19.720]  we're doing nothing wrong there's literally five times as many police
[1:10:19.720 --> 1:10:23.720]  officers than there's work the people there the people weren't even protesting
[1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:27.680]  we're just meeting on a park there are civilians walking by talking to you but
[1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:30.840]  again you're not allowed to meet on your front porch not in the park not day or
[1:10:30.840 --> 1:10:36.680]  night you now live in tyranny continue look because because it's important that
[1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:41.920]  they singled you out more than anybody with the charges with the strip search
[1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:45.800]  with the torture go ahead you want to say something they'll call me the ring
[1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:49.160]  ringleader and I was just trying to keep the peace between the police officers
[1:10:49.160 --> 1:10:53.240]  and the people they don't want that they did they they said we me and Luke we're
[1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:56.560]  trying to get out with our press passes and they said nope this guy is starting
[1:10:56.560 --> 1:10:59.520]  everything he's the one he's the ringleader here and they and they sat
[1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:03.160]  him down and did the zip ties right on his back and all he was preaching was
[1:11:03.160 --> 1:11:05.960]  we got a watch out for agent provocateurs and we got a loved one
[1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:09.480]  another our this system is gonna tear you don't do that in America veterans
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:13.360]  fought so that police and Darth Vader outfits can beat teenage girls you
[1:11:13.360 --> 1:11:19.120]  understand so that foreign banks can tilt can steal 23.7 trillion that's
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:23.920]  what this country is about anybody that says it was about freedom is al-qaeda
[1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:28.200]  we got everybody out of the park because they kicked us out the park we're on the
[1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:31.880]  sidewalk and then as we were trying to leave the police officers block off
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:36.800]  another street it was literally police officers coming out of every corner every
[1:11:36.800 --> 1:11:41.200]  street so we couldn't escape we were by this church in this park and the police
[1:11:41.200 --> 1:11:45.240]  officer started corralling the thing so we walked into the park trying to escape
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:49.280]  we got everybody over the fence we walked into this park and we were walking
[1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:53.280]  across the street and across the street there's a line of police officers they
[1:11:53.280 --> 1:11:57.840]  shot off a good one of those grenades right in front of everybody huge smoke
[1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:02.160]  grenade goes off we go to the right there's no police officers a band of
[1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:06.320]  police officers start running out of nowhere out of the corner and I'm on
[1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:10.480]  the ball I was like guys we just want to go home can you please clear up first

[1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:29.040]  American people and if you don't think that the police won't follow orders to
[1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:32.400]  take you to a FEMA camp as they've been training them to do if you don't think
[1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:39.120]  they won't take your guns they have been brainwashed the most important thing
[1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:42.400]  that we have to understand here the police were telling us to disperse at
[1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:46.200]  the same time blocking everybody off my friend Nate from we are changing Rhode
[1:13:46.200 --> 1:13:50.240]  Island was there saying he heard the cops saying you block them off block them
[1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:53.840]  off we're gonna arrest all of them at the same time the huge alloy machine has
[1:13:53.840 --> 1:13:57.720]  gone off saying disperse to get out of here or you will be arrested they were
[1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:01.760]  blocking everybody off they take their normal hunting instincts and turn it
[1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:05.120]  against their own species but hey cops you think you're tough and dark and
[1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:08.360]  powerful the bankers are putting stuff in your water supply and your vaccines
[1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:12.800]  and stealing all your money so don't worry you don't win just know that you
[1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:18.560]  don't win once they arrested you we face the wall and then we have to jump a
[1:14:18.560 --> 1:14:22.480]  gate to get away from the police officers we jump another gate went left
[1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:27.040]  because there's police officers right and they outflank us as I'm jumping over
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:30.600]  this gate everybody's jumping fall and hurting themselves this guy the town
[1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:34.840]  to me right on my back I am I was flipping and running and we ran and as
[1:14:34.840 --> 1:14:38.040]  we ran the police officers blocked off the other route they blocked us in
[1:14:38.040 --> 1:14:42.920]  against this wall in all three ways and that is that is excessive force that is
[1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:46.520]  violence but they're setting the precedent that what they get in trouble
[1:14:46.520 --> 1:14:53.320]  for for Rodney King 20 years ago they get a medal for today again assaulting
[1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:56.880]  people being able to murder people like the girl with the red socks came she
[1:14:56.880 --> 1:15:00.120]  comes out of a bar they shoot her in the face rubber bullet she dies the cops
[1:15:00.120 --> 1:15:04.440]  had a celebration hey they got to kill a 20-year-old woman they're powerful they
[1:15:04.440 --> 1:15:07.520]  actually that's like a trophy they like see that guy that killed her now as a
[1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:11.080]  real man the force who you murdered a 20-year-old girl a journalist you're
[1:15:11.080 --> 1:15:16.040]  tough you kill that's right we kill Americans that's what we're here for on
[1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:19.960]  the board I was telling them let us leave like you're saying us to leave they
[1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:23.240]  blocked us all in and they said oh yeah we're gonna leave you we're gonna let
[1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:26.480]  you leave in a couple minutes and I was like so let us leave now what's your
[1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:30.080]  problem and then that they were all talking against each other they brought
[1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:33.600]  in their arrest teams and they told everybody lay on your stomach and put
[1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:38.080]  your hands behind your back we all did that and then the police officers walking
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:42.560]  by with the tear gas was just walking by this huge six-foot yeah that's why they
[1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:47.900]  have all right and torture in the public schools and torture in Iraq and the

[1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:19.720]  are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental
[1:16:19.720 --> 1:16:24.280]  system diseases now what are you going to do about it the acola blue atmospheric

[1:21:49.520 --> 1:21:53.840]  bleeding other people wanted to use the bathroom they were not allowed to see the
[1:21:53.840 --> 1:21:58.080]  medic for four to five hours people soiled their pants because they're not
[1:21:58.080 --> 1:22:02.120]  can use the bathroom there were soldiers that from Iraq that were arrested with us
[1:22:02.120 --> 1:22:05.840]  that said that I the Iraqi prisoners get better treatment than this if they
[1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:11.000]  want to use the bathroom no one is in America you know they get the medic
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:14.920]  let's see them but these people these people we were treated so such horribly
[1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:19.080]  and we were sent to the detention center that was run by the National Guard and
[1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:23.440]  the army the FBI was there taking everybody's information down and they
[1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:27.120]  had so many people who were there that they were they couldn't process everybody
[1:22:27.120 --> 1:22:31.120]  and they just sad us up I mean the way we were treated we were treated worse
[1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:35.520]  than prisoners these military guys were coming up to us saying stand up straight
[1:22:35.520 --> 1:22:39.480]  look at the wall don't speak don't say a single word they're treating us like we

[1:24:23.120 --> 1:24:28.480]  total takeover look the thing is they sat me up in a section and then they were
[1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:32.960]  taking me out and they were taking me on the bus to state prison for some reason
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:37.480]  it was me and Lee from we are changed Chicago that were sent on this bus and
[1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:40.520]  as we're going on this bus you know there's these people in these black

[1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:55.280]  about black water rapes a little women and children in Iraq and they're like
[1:24:55.280 --> 1:24:59.160]  you're crazy they threw me in the bus shoved me in the bus we went all the
[1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:03.600]  way down to the bus to the state prison me and Lee from we are changed Chicago we
[1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:07.440]  got targeted and everybody else was being it was staying there we were the
[1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:10.880]  ones facing charges everybody was released without a charge without a
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:14.720]  court date they sent us to the state prison we go into the state prison
[1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:19.360]  there's it looked like a scene out of Nazi Germany these Gestapo cops coming
[1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:23.320]  in there with their batons pointing it right in my face as I'm sitting there

[1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:54.240]  is that this is total federalization this is what they have in store for the
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:59.160]  American people the government has gone rogue and they declared martial law
[1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:03.840]  across the city and attacked women with police dogs I mean this is just the
[1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:09.200]  height of sickeningness I was everywhere I went when they threw me in the jail
[1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:11.760]  they had these people that were interviewing us for the judge and
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:15.520]  they're like yeah you're that guy on TV we saw you on channel two and channel

[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:24.640]  that guy I came right there and everybody I encountered knew the message
[1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:30.360]  about Blackwater I got a call from the G20 security Friday I talked to him
[1:26:30.360 --> 1:26:33.960]  didn't know call the number it was a police number never wrote a report as
[1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:41.440]  I was busy finishing follow the Republic and then what ended up happening is we
[1:26:41.440 --> 1:26:45.680]  posted the article from Ross story Drudge also did G20 said those are secret
[1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:51.880]  officers in police uniforms they were hired and now the MO is those were some
[1:26:51.880 --> 1:26:56.160]  type of Blackwater and we know they use Blackwater to raid marijuana
[1:26:56.160 --> 1:27:00.760]  distilleries dispensaries in California you're about to say something yeah the
[1:27:00.760 --> 1:27:04.400]  first day we were there and the first day we encountered any of the actual
[1:27:04.400 --> 1:27:09.520]  riot police there was a gentleman in a USMC dressed up like a construction
[1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:13.920]  worker and I noticed him around I was like well he's got this walkie talkie
[1:27:13.920 --> 1:27:18.600]  he looks like he might be secret police so then just turning another corner
[1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:23.000]  probably two three hours later that I'd seen him I see him again and I filmed
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:27.240]  him and I filmed his red truck and the license plate while me and Rob do were
[1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:33.200]  at the facility awaiting to talk to a spokesperson five other red trucks the
[1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:38.720]  same exact make-and-model as the one that gentleman had come rolling out of
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:42.000]  yeah we've been to urban warfare drills where they have the Marines and Army in

[1:33:17.880 --> 1:33:21.560]  in the final segment into your book coming out in the Fed but first I've
[1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:27.320]  got the Times of London the London Telegraph AFP dollar under scrutiny at
[1:33:27.320 --> 1:33:33.440]  G20 summit HSBC bids farewell to dollar supremacy they say the world is now
[1:33:33.440 --> 1:33:37.560]  going to move away from the dollar they're announcing global governments
[1:33:37.560 --> 1:33:41.720]  president Kloss your friend you've been over there to speak as a guest of the
[1:33:41.720 --> 1:33:47.080]  of the government is saying this is global government at the UN yesterday so
[1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:52.280]  people are waking up but now the establishment is making its move can you
[1:33:52.280 --> 1:33:57.120]  speak to what's happening with the dollar well the dollar of course today
[1:33:57.120 --> 1:34:00.800]  bounced up a little bit but that's just temporary because of some announcements
[1:34:00.800 --> 1:34:05.360]  but the dollar is in in bad trouble and they know it a lot of people ask me
[1:34:05.360 --> 1:34:08.280]  exactly what's going on the G20 meetings and of course there are a lot of
[1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:11.880]  announcements I think the really big stuff that goes on at these meetings is
[1:34:11.880 --> 1:34:15.440]  behind the scenes and there are no announcements my guess would be that
[1:34:15.440 --> 1:34:19.360]  behind the scenes they are really really making the plans for what's going to
[1:34:19.360 --> 1:34:23.280]  replace the dollar reserve standard because they're sick and tired of us
[1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:26.160]  getting a free ride we get to print the money and get to spend it they're
[1:34:26.160 --> 1:34:30.160]  supposed to take on to it as if it were gold so but they're they're planning on
[1:34:30.160 --> 1:34:35.240]  something else but they they have a job in front of them because it's not easy
[1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:41.040]  creating another fiat currency usually when a government ruins the currency
[1:34:41.040 --> 1:34:45.360]  they go back to something more sound and back their currency or they go
[1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:50.040]  silver legal tender they don't want to do that that's why I suspect they'll
[1:34:50.040 --> 1:34:54.920]  move in the direction of just a new world order and I hear and I've heard
[1:34:54.920 --> 1:35:00.400]  Obama recently use that term again they got to have a new world order and they've
[1:35:00.400 --> 1:35:04.160]  been working on that for a long time and I'm sure they're not worried all that
[1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:09.560]  much about a crisis coming in they might look at it as an opportunity you know
[1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:13.480]  for promoting their cause and that's what we should be concerned about well
[1:35:13.480 --> 1:35:16.640]  that's what congressman Grayson said last hour with us is that the banks he
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:20.200]  believes have engineered this to create a crisis to vertically integrate
[1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:24.280]  society and then they offer the solution as this new bank of the world that will
[1:35:24.280 --> 1:35:28.640]  fund itself off carbon taxes and Tobin taxes Al Gore is called for that Gordon
[1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:32.600]  Brown this week as you know has called for a new world order under the Tobin
[1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:39.440]  tax and that they're just going to have regional cashless systems with the big
[1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:43.240]  bank reserves already going to a cashless system and then all the nation
[1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:47.880]  state currencies will still be there but they'll be globally standardized yeah
[1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:53.000]  but what we have going for us is that their system can't work it's just sort
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:56.720]  of like worrying about this Soviet Union we worried about it for a long time and
[1:35:56.720 --> 1:36:02.280]  had to be and they were very powerful but even me says long time ago predicted
[1:36:02.280 --> 1:36:06.560]  it won't last the system doesn't work so what they're proposing really doesn't
[1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:11.080]  work it's sort of like what they did the IMF and our Treasury did in the 60s and
[1:36:11.080 --> 1:36:15.560]  early 70s we're going to print money and it's going to be worth $35 an ounce and
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:20.160]  you know guarantee that well the market overwhelms so we should be concerned we
[1:36:20.160 --> 1:36:24.240]  should fight it we should expose them and we should do our very best but
[1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:29.800]  ultimately the markets will rule the biggest threat is probably the political
[1:36:29.800 --> 1:36:33.720]  threat that how much are they going to crack down on us how much how far they
[1:36:33.720 --> 1:36:38.000]  going to go and can we ever regain you know the influence on the government
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:41.960]  where their job is to protect us and protect our liberty rather than serving
[1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:46.640]  the special interest that to me is really the bottom line congressman the
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:53.200]  Federal Reserve as you know has hired the top Enron lobbyist firm to come in
[1:36:53.200 --> 1:36:57.600]  in the last three months and demonize the in the Fed protest it's come out in
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:01.880]  the Baltimore Sun the army is surveilling the in the Fed protest and
[1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:05.760]  that all protests is now being considered low-level terrorism they're
[1:37:05.760 --> 1:37:09.680]  trying to demonize us that way they've also told Congress as you know that oh
[1:37:09.680 --> 1:37:12.640]  you're not allowed under the Constitution to get involved with the
[1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:15.920]  Federal Reserve does even though it's in the Constitution that the Congress
[1:37:15.920 --> 1:37:22.040]  control the issuance of currency and credit and set the monetary policy so
[1:37:22.040 --> 1:37:26.200]  isn't that the ultimate big lie to say that this thing that didn't come along
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:30.800]  till 1913 this private banking consortium can tell Congress you're not
[1:37:30.800 --> 1:37:37.000]  allowed to be involved it's amazing how long they've gotten away with it but
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:42.120]  we're getting the American people informed well enough that 75% of the
[1:37:42.120 --> 1:37:46.360]  people now when they're polled agree with us I get interesting I can give you a
[1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:50.200]  little tidbit about tomorrow and maybe Alan told you the same thing but you
[1:37:50.200 --> 1:37:54.200]  know we're having hearings tomorrow in 1207 and Barty Frank has fulfilled his
[1:37:54.200 --> 1:37:57.960]  promise to me and he gave me one witness and they were going to have two
[1:37:57.960 --> 1:38:03.080]  panels ordinarily the majority has two witnesses against one you know two to
[1:38:03.080 --> 1:38:07.760]  one but then they have a government panel which has to represent the the body
[1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:10.480]  that we're addressing which is the Federal Reserve they were supposed to
[1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:15.360]  have three people testifying only one has agreed to come on the second panel
[1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:19.560]  when there were going to be two in opposition to 1207 and my one pick
[1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:25.560]  those two canceled out to so they're down to one person that came to testify
[1:38:25.560 --> 1:38:32.880]  against the 1207 and I suspect it may well be that they don't want to even be
[1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:37.200]  out there you know really chopping at the bit they might work behind the scenes
[1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:40.920]  behind us but they're not interested in taking us on in a public forum they
[1:38:40.920 --> 1:38:44.320]  don't want to give any attention to it they think it may be covered by the
[1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:48.320]  news networks in Bernanke or somebody like that is there but it's too late as
[1:38:48.320 --> 1:38:52.000]  you've said many times the momentum is now beginning to shift the people are
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:56.080]  like why can't we audit the Fed they're realizing that the real power structure
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:00.760]  the real government is the private run-for-profit fellow reserve and I
[1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:04.080]  meant to get to this issue of the hearings can you talk about what's
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:08.400]  going to happen tomorrow and then how you see the process unfolding in the
[1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:12.920]  months and years to come in bringing this corporate private banking
[1:39:12.920 --> 1:39:18.280]  dictatorship to heal well I think tomorrow's hearings will be pretty
[1:39:18.280 --> 1:39:22.840]  bland that would be my guess probably not much media but we'll get a recording
[1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:26.520]  of it and Tom Wood is the a good economist and historian for the
[1:39:26.520 --> 1:39:31.440]  visas to he'll be testifying for us and he will have a very good statement and
[1:39:31.440 --> 1:39:36.120]  he's a very bright person and knows you know how to handle a debate like this
[1:39:36.120 --> 1:39:42.040]  Bonnie Frank will probably be not antagonistic nor derogatory toward the
[1:39:42.040 --> 1:39:46.760]  bill and he will try to publicly pacify the people who are concerned and
[1:39:46.760 --> 1:39:51.800]  worried about it but I don't think it'll be big news tomorrow but it's big
[1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:56.480]  news among our circles because we have gotten them to a point where many others
[1:39:56.480 --> 1:39:59.720]  who have tried over the many many decades and have never gotten this far
[1:39:59.720 --> 1:40:04.960]  just think you know Henry Royce right Patman and Henry Gonzalez all coming
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:08.200]  from a liberal populist viewpoint have always said they were chairman of the
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:13.200]  banking committees and they they never got this far on auditing the Fed so we
[1:40:13.200 --> 1:40:17.880]  are making progress but it also might be a sign of how bad things are to wake up
[1:40:17.880 --> 1:40:21.800]  the American people to finally say hey what is this all about what about the Fed
[1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:26.360]  so I think it's the crisis that we're in as well as the time has come around and
[1:40:26.360 --> 1:40:30.200]  I think our communications are so much better with radio talk shows like this
[1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:35.120]  as well as the internet this has really spread a message among people today I
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:39.000]  just walked out my office I was visiting with one of my constituents and I had a
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:43.760]  young guy came out in his college he's from Arizona and his biggest issue with
[1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:47.760]  the Federal Reserve I think I could my constituents look at it and say wow you
[1:40:47.760 --> 1:40:52.920]  know he was so impressive some college kid from the Arizona State came up and
[1:40:52.920 --> 1:40:57.440]  he was fascinated you know with the with the Federal Reserve so we are making
[1:40:57.440 --> 1:41:02.840]  progress is this the beginning of game over for the Federal Reserve because
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:07.400]  once they're identified as the true shadow government the financial oligarchy
[1:41:07.400 --> 1:41:12.360]  as long as they can operate the shadows and poses a federal agency they were
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:18.320]  invincible but once the curtain drops on the little man who we thought was the
[1:41:18.320 --> 1:41:21.800]  big powerful Wizard of Oz once the illusion is shattered which is now
[1:41:21.800 --> 1:41:27.560]  happening it begins the process of their fault I think it might be beginning
[1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:30.960]  but I don't think we're very far along because I don't think they have yet
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:35.240]  begun to fight I mean they are going to be tenacious look at what they're done
[1:41:35.240 --> 1:41:39.320]  with the lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act they are resisting
[1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:42.320]  they're fighting it those court cases are going to go on for years they're
[1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:45.240]  going to fight this they're going to resist and argue about turning over
[1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:52.000]  records so it's not it's not going to be real easy I think what will happen when
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:57.800]  you have a dramatic change will be when the dollar quits working I just think
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:42:01.840]  they're going to fight us the tooth and nail and they're going to be very very
[1:42:01.840 --> 1:42:05.800]  difficult they'll find the ways to further imprison people who demand that
[1:42:05.800 --> 1:42:12.280]  they use silver and gold so I I just think that it'll be runaway inflation
[1:42:12.280 --> 1:42:15.440]  high interest rates where the American people say yeah I think we were told
[1:42:15.440 --> 1:42:19.240]  about this Federal Reserve and we need to do more and then they'll lose all
[1:42:19.240 --> 1:42:22.640]  credibility and besides printing the money won't help that much the more
[1:42:22.640 --> 1:42:26.440]  they print the worse it'll be right now they print a lot of money to try to
[1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:30.680]  patch the system together in some ways they have patched together but they
[1:42:30.680 --> 1:42:35.280]  dumped all the bad assets on the taxpayer you can't have a wealthy
[1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:41.360]  country by doing that that is that will that has to have bad results but when
[1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:45.800]  the dollar collapses there's nowhere else to go
[1:42:45.800 --> 1:43:05.000]  the illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:08.440]  want you to eat will you continue to be their profit center buying their

[1:46:55.320 --> 1:46:57.840]  dot net
[1:46:57.840 --> 1:47:19.640]  the congressman I don't even pretend to know what's best to suggest you do
[1:47:19.640 --> 1:47:25.640]  tomorrow in these hearings but I know you're a very polite focused
[1:47:25.640 --> 1:47:31.360]  intelligent scholarly person I would just encourage you to call him out and to
[1:47:31.360 --> 1:47:37.440]  be as aggressive as possible because that more firmly cement you as the
[1:47:37.440 --> 1:47:40.840]  leader and I think you're the man for the job against these people and I would
[1:47:40.840 --> 1:47:44.120]  also hope that you would entertain and perhaps I would ask now what your
[1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:48.160]  opinion is of this to bring up the conflict of interest issue that you
[1:47:48.160 --> 1:47:52.160]  have this revolving door between Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase and the
[1:47:52.160 --> 1:47:57.920]  governors of the private Fed like Geithner Paulson Bernackie the campaign
[1:47:57.920 --> 1:48:02.920]  contributions to both parties of course Barack Obama getting four times the
[1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:08.600]  Goldman Sachs money almost five times that John McCain got I really think if
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:12.760]  you just discredit them out of the gates that's the one thing that I've noticed
[1:48:12.760 --> 1:48:15.400]  in these hearings and I've watched scores of them I know you've been in
[1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:20.000]  scores of them I watched them at night when I get home I recorded hours of it
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:25.800]  and that seems to be the cross or the holy water to the vampires just to call
[1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:28.920]  these people out that they're the ones that change the regulations they're the
[1:48:28.920 --> 1:48:31.840]  ones that created the derivatives they're the ones that are a revolving
[1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:37.640]  door in their robin bank well there'll be a limit to how much of that I can do
[1:48:37.640 --> 1:48:42.680]  because I'll have a five-minute opening statement in five minutes to quiz at the
[1:48:42.680 --> 1:48:47.360]  individuals but they're not sending the people that would that you could really
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:51.200]  hit on those questions they're sending the general counsel now he's going to be
[1:48:51.200 --> 1:48:56.560]  a legal guy he's going to explain the law and that sort of thing they're going
[1:48:56.560 --> 1:49:00.600]  to hide behind the technicalities of the law thank your suggestions are good we
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:06.800]  should call on them but I will have to decide tomorrow exactly how I'm going to
[1:49:06.800 --> 1:49:10.760]  hit them and what the atmosphere is like sure we don't want to let the cat out
[1:49:10.760 --> 1:49:14.640]  of the bag or let them know our plan of attack to defend the Republic but clearly
[1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:17.480]  if you say sir because obviously you're going to be asking him questions for a
[1:49:17.480 --> 1:49:22.120]  future hearing can you go back and ask him you know how the Treasury Department
[1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:28.040]  and the Federal Reserve gives itself waivers to allow them to give money to
[1:49:28.040 --> 1:49:33.920]  institutions they own stock in well that's a it should be shocking but
[1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:38.120]  unfortunately that's about the way they run everything they're always you know
[1:49:38.120 --> 1:49:43.360]  skirting the law it's only the people who have to if they have any infraction
[1:49:43.360 --> 1:49:48.200]  on not obeying and they'll lead a law or disobeying or obeying the Constitution
[1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:53.640]  then the the roof comes down on us but for them that's you know just routine
[1:49:53.640 --> 1:49:58.800]  activities but they should be called on it and that's exactly where the American
[1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:01.840]  people are waking up they're sick and tired of hearing it and the more they
[1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:08.920]  hear it the better congressman looking at this congressman Grayson pointed out
[1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:14.920]  the last hour you in 1983 first introduced this audit the Fed bill and
[1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:21.280]  then now here we are 25 26 years later and even though it may take a few more
[1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:25.840]  years to really have victory over these people we are now I believe in the end
[1:50:25.840 --> 1:50:30.120]  game here and can you speak to the power of perseverance and focus you
[1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:36.480]  literally on the front lines toiling to do this and then what is it like for you
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:42.680]  to actually see Jerusalem to actually be going into the promised land to now be
[1:50:42.680 --> 1:50:46.840]  able to look over the mountain and after this 10,000 mile journey you're now
[1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:51.440]  only a few hundred miles away I don't like to address that in a personal way
[1:50:51.440 --> 1:50:57.040]  as much as in in general I think if an individual wants if they want if a
[1:50:57.040 --> 1:51:02.080]  person wants to change things they have to deal in principle they have to have
[1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:08.360]  an ability to state it clearly and they have to persevere perseverance I think
[1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:11.720]  is very very important but you have to have truth on your side and eventually
[1:51:11.720 --> 1:51:16.840]  you do win actually I did not believe we would get this far I did not believe
[1:51:16.840 --> 1:51:24.040]  that the campaign that we ran like last year would get very far so it was much
[1:51:24.040 --> 1:51:27.440]  more encouraging to me to realize that there were a lot of people I believed
[1:51:27.440 --> 1:51:30.720]  when I came to Congress in fact when I ran I never thought I was even coming to
[1:51:30.720 --> 1:51:36.080]  Congress when I came my role and responsibility is to try to leave a
[1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:39.720]  record to saying you know what would it be like if you had somebody that took
[1:51:39.720 --> 1:51:44.760]  the oath of office very seriously how would that person vote realizing you
[1:51:44.760 --> 1:51:50.000]  know what I was up against because I realize you and I would use the term
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:53.880]  we can't really run against Santa Claus that you're not going to get reelected
[1:51:53.880 --> 1:51:57.360]  I was surprised I got elected surprised I got reelected but pleasantly
[1:51:57.360 --> 1:52:02.080]  surprised to find out that this attitude of perseverance and standing for
[1:52:02.080 --> 1:52:08.240]  principle you know really can bring about you know good results so I'm
[1:52:08.240 --> 1:52:13.040]  pleased with it but it's the power of the ideas more than my personal abilities
[1:52:13.040 --> 1:52:17.040]  quite frankly well sir I appreciate your humbleness I'm not here trying to
[1:52:17.040 --> 1:52:22.080]  lavish praise on you for praise sake I think as a model or an example of
[1:52:22.080 --> 1:52:29.280]  perseverance you are the standard you're the blood of courage and I want you to
[1:52:29.280 --> 1:52:32.000]  know that no I want you to know I have three children just like you have a lot
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:35.640]  of children and grandchildren and I care about them and I know that we're going
[1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:41.000]  to be a third world hell if you're not successful if I'm not successful and I
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:45.080]  just really do admire you and I know everybody for everybody out there we
[1:52:45.080 --> 1:52:50.120]  want to thank you for all you've done well thank you very much I appreciate
[1:52:50.120 --> 1:52:54.320]  that and evidently our numbers are much bigger than any of us knows you know the
[1:52:54.320 --> 1:52:58.520]  story about the remnant nobody can count the remnant nobody knows where they
[1:52:58.520 --> 1:53:04.320]  are but they're out there and I think they're we each and every one of our
[1:53:04.320 --> 1:53:07.960]  looking for each other and it's just great to find allies I always tell
[1:53:07.960 --> 1:53:11.320]  people with my crowds I said you know I don't know what tomorrow will bring and
[1:53:11.320 --> 1:53:17.960]  I don't have you know I don't have over expectations but in the meantime we
[1:53:17.960 --> 1:53:21.800]  ought to have an enjoyment of associating with like-minded people and
[1:53:21.800 --> 1:53:27.440]  having these goals and ideals because at least we can say that we made the effort
[1:53:27.440 --> 1:53:32.000]  when we communicated but fortunately for us today we have seen some fruits of
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:37.520]  our labor can you imagine fighting this battle in 1939 or sometime back then
[1:53:37.520 --> 1:53:42.160]  when they when the new deal was in and then the world empire was really
[1:53:42.160 --> 1:53:49.000]  starting the militarism of the world I would have thought back in 1938 39 in
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:53.800]  the Roosevelt era it must have been pretty humbling for those of those who
[1:53:53.800 --> 1:53:57.680]  were trying to hold these principles together we've only got seven minutes
[1:53:57.680 --> 1:54:01.360]  left with the congressman I'm gonna skip this break so we have time to do
[1:54:01.360 --> 1:54:05.040]  that it's a network break and before he leaves we're gonna talk about his new
[1:54:05.040 --> 1:54:09.520]  book in the Fed a really a manifesto a constitution against this abomination
[1:54:09.520 --> 1:54:16.120]  one arm of this larger private crime syndicate but congressman a what can we
[1:54:16.120 --> 1:54:21.480]  do briefly to fight and help you and others that are leading this charge to
[1:54:21.480 --> 1:54:28.000]  defeat the Fed quicker in this battle in this war for truth a and then be what
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  do you think their counter strikes are going to be the governor's Association a
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:36.840]  month ago wrote a letter to the Pentagon in the White House saying what are you
[1:54:36.840 --> 1:54:41.440]  doing saying 379,000 troops they now want for brigade homeland through
[1:54:41.440 --> 1:54:46.760]  Northcom that's also in the progressive in AP they are I don't know if you've
[1:54:46.760 --> 1:54:49.600]  seen this suddenly we're getting YouTube videos from Kingman Arizona to
[1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:54.200]  Louisville Kentucky of regular National Guard and Army running checkpoints or
[1:54:54.200 --> 1:54:57.280]  searching people we've gone and interviewed them now and it appears that
[1:54:57.280 --> 1:55:02.440]  we're seeing a slow takeover and former congressman or Republican leader was in
[1:55:02.440 --> 1:55:06.360]  the Dallas morning news Dick army just giving you a quick briefing in case I'm
[1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:10.000]  sure you know about most of it saying yes he believes Obama may use the flu
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:14.720]  scare to kind of smoke screen passing health care gun control open borders
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:18.840]  financial reform giving the banks more power so can you speak to what we can do
[1:55:18.840 --> 1:55:23.280]  to fight these people and to the whole police state that's really expanding
[1:55:23.280 --> 1:55:27.640]  right now well I'm afraid positive comment on this is about dad according you
[1:55:27.640 --> 1:55:31.960]  know according to what Obama wants you know when they passed the hit the law
[1:55:31.960 --> 1:55:34.920]  hit the law was the one that said that they were going to protect your medical
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:40.760]  privacy in actuality it was act exactly the opposite because in that hit the law
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:45.360]  is that in case of a national emergency the government has a right to all your
[1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:51.360]  record now you talk about a scare they keep scaring and frightening people and
[1:55:51.360 --> 1:55:56.480]  they put the high executives taking these flu shots and how dangerous it is
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:02.600]  and on and on so I think they're almost just welcoming and waiting boy there's
[1:56:02.600 --> 1:56:07.000]  just a little bit more we can declare all this national emergency stuff but
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:11.400]  it's done under you know they have set the stage for doing it under medical
[1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:16.040]  control and control of diseases always you know for these wonderful things but
[1:56:16.040 --> 1:56:20.160]  unfortunately I'm afraid the American people are going to suffer the
[1:56:20.160 --> 1:56:25.760]  consequences but all we can do is expose them for what they are and hopefully
[1:56:25.760 --> 1:56:29.080]  the American people will wake up well this really hit home for me and I've
[1:56:29.080 --> 1:56:33.720]  talked to the Pittsburgh the county that Pittsburgh is in you grew up there
[1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:37.600]  what's the name of the county Allegheny the Allegheny and I talked to the police
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:41.200]  officer we've got his name my guys were trying to interview the military and
[1:56:41.200 --> 1:56:44.920]  trying to ask him because there's 2,500 of them there including regular army and
[1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:47.920]  Air Force along with National Guard they said may we speak to your public

[1:56:58.120 --> 1:57:01.560]  they were the the police officer switched gears and said well you're now on
