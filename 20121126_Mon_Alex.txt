[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:35.200]  Texas Alex Jones I hope you're locked in and ready ladies and gentlemen because
[00:35.200 --> 00:40.080]  I'm a wound up and there is a ton of absolutely off the chart important news
[00:40.080 --> 00:45.440]  as usual the quickening is intensifying the world's supposed to end what
[00:45.440 --> 00:50.120]  December 21st of course I've been saying for a decade that it's a total hoax and
[00:50.120 --> 00:54.600]  a total fraud not only I did the Mayans not know it was going to happen in the
[00:54.600 --> 01:01.440]  future but they didn't say the world would end December 21st or any time
[01:01.440 --> 01:09.840]  around there 2012 but according to all the trendies the world is going to end
[01:09.840 --> 01:15.680]  in less than 30 days so I thought today we should probably interspersed with the
[01:15.680 --> 01:20.720]  news and the rest of it I wanted to open the phones up only for people that
[01:20.720 --> 01:25.960]  want to talk about 2012 do you agree with me do you disagree with what I'm
[01:25.960 --> 01:29.280]  saying I'll give the number out open the phones up we come back in the next
[01:29.280 --> 01:36.720]  segment also last night on the radio show I began to get into Rand Paul calling
[01:36.720 --> 01:40.800]  for amnesty and I only spent a few minutes on it and did not really make my
[01:40.800 --> 01:47.760]  points and so I forgot to ask you guys will you pull me yesterday stack I know
[01:47.760 --> 01:52.440]  this is it right here but also print me articles just type in Rand Paul amnesty
[01:52.440 --> 01:56.720]  Rand Paul immigration reform and give me four or five mainstream news articles
[01:56.720 --> 02:01.120]  I mean I know what he said but I want the exact quotes his statement it was all
[02:01.120 --> 02:05.320]  over the news last Friday through yesterday and I want to be able to hold
[02:05.320 --> 02:08.800]  that up for people watching on prisonplanet.tv as I knew radically do
[02:08.800 --> 02:13.000]  with about 95% of whatever we cover here it's gotten the point now if I can't
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.120]  show you the news article I won't even cover something most of the time but I'm
[02:17.120 --> 02:20.920]  not gonna attack Rand Paul but at the bottom of the hour I do want to say
[02:20.920 --> 02:25.960]  about five minutes of words on the situation because if the globalist get
[02:25.960 --> 02:36.880]  unamnesty this already dead Republic is gonna be double dead and I want to
[02:36.880 --> 02:40.560]  explain why the people so folks the great crew in there dealing with my
[02:40.560 --> 02:43.600]  scatterbrain we make sure at bottom of the hour I have that and then I do cover
[02:43.600 --> 02:50.080]  it as promised here but you know I meant to have the next issue the December
[02:50.080 --> 02:53.160]  issue of the magazine have a 2012 report in it but I thought you know what it
[02:53.160 --> 02:56.760]  doesn't even matter everybody knows it's a hoax and instead I did it all about
[02:56.760 --> 03:00.760]  Obama's reelection and what we face and Ron Paul's battle plan to restore the
[03:00.760 --> 03:05.720]  Republic and we're printing his entire farewell address in the magazine as well
[03:05.720 --> 03:10.160]  that'll be out just a few days there's a few copies the last issue if you want it
[03:10.160 --> 03:13.600]  it's excellent as well dealing with the transformation of the public into mind
[03:13.600 --> 03:17.440]  numb zombies it's a great Christmas gift I'm not really trying to plug but I
[03:17.440 --> 03:21.720]  guess it turns into a plug because I plug what is solution based you can get
[03:21.720 --> 03:25.920]  12 issues delivered your door plus back issues when they're available in the
[03:25.920 --> 03:29.960]  first delivery sometimes folks get a few magazines to a three in their first
[03:29.960 --> 03:33.960]  issue something we can't guarantee that the point is a lot of times you get that
[03:33.960 --> 03:36.960]  but you get 12 issues delivered to your door to your friends and family door I
[03:36.960 --> 03:39.840]  can't think of a better way to wake people up and I'm not plugging this
[03:39.840 --> 03:43.280]  because it makes us no money the magazine is designed to break even though
[03:43.280 --> 03:47.840]  when we syndicated it's going to be you know to regional folks publishing it
[03:47.840 --> 03:51.080]  there is a profit model which we've proven it can be profitable but we've
[03:51.080 --> 03:54.200]  decided to not make it profitable just because we want it to be accessible to
[03:54.200 --> 03:58.760]  everyone kind of like prison planet TV now it's 59 cents per membership a month

[04:15.320 --> 04:20.560]  financials that that makes it break even right there if half of those folks end up

[08:24.840 --> 08:30.960]  11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central standard time we are blasting out the voice of liberty
[08:30.960 --> 08:38.360]  worldwide waging war on corruption crashing through the lies and
[08:38.360 --> 08:43.240]  disinformation I am sworn to defend liberty and I know many of you love
[08:43.240 --> 08:47.120]  freedom as well and love truth and justice it's not that any of us are on a
[08:47.120 --> 08:51.200]  high horse are perfect but we certainly choose life we certainly choose to be

[09:02.400 --> 09:11.080]  this together again it is Monday the 26th day of November 2012 and there's a
[09:11.080 --> 09:14.440]  ton of news I didn't get to on the Sunday show because I was in a very dark
[09:14.440 --> 09:20.280]  mood yesterday I had a lot of bad family news yesterday that I won't get into on
[09:20.280 --> 09:25.120]  air and I tend to get into a dark mood occasionally but nevertheless we are in
[09:25.120 --> 09:30.240]  a dark situation and not admitting how much of a crisis we're in is only going
[09:30.240 --> 09:33.720]  to get us into worst rates so I don't overall apologize for being in a dark
[09:33.720 --> 09:38.840]  mood but it's probably not too good for morale but I cannot apologize for being
[09:38.840 --> 09:46.200]  real I do the best I can continuing here there's a lot of obvious new news that
[09:46.200 --> 09:49.440]  we need to get into the globalist are getting the whole world ready for the
[09:49.440 --> 09:53.840]  next phase of the economic implosion into open depression we've been into
[09:53.840 --> 09:57.800]  depression worldwide for about four years most top economists like John
[09:57.800 --> 10:02.760]  Williams of shadow stats and others have confirmed that Joseph Stiklitz Nobel
[10:02.760 --> 10:07.520]  Prize winner in economics and also in peace dr. Paul Craig Roberts has said
[10:07.520 --> 10:11.360]  that we've been into depression for a long time the late great Bob Chapman has
[10:11.360 --> 10:16.720]  broken that down you've got many others that have you know the Mark Faber has
[10:16.720 --> 10:22.160]  said for most areas the world we are in a depression but there but the system is
[10:22.160 --> 10:25.080]  said we're not even in a recession they're getting ready to admit a
[10:25.080 --> 10:30.560]  depression and say we need carbon taxes we need VAT and that will keep the
[10:30.560 --> 10:35.440]  welfare flowing and then they'll prop things up a little bit kind of slow the
[10:35.440 --> 10:41.200]  landslide down the avalanche they'll slow that down a little bit while
[10:41.200 --> 10:49.720]  demanding all these new taxes and when the globalist get their VAT their carbon
[10:49.720 --> 10:52.680]  and their wellhead and they've got a bunch others but they're going to get
[10:52.680 --> 10:58.000]  ram all those in saying hey the stock market's dropped 4,000 points 5,000
[10:58.000 --> 11:04.200]  points you know the welfare checks aren't gonna make it and I don't know if
[11:04.200 --> 11:06.640]  they'll do this this year next year the point is they've already done it in
[11:06.640 --> 11:11.760]  Europe three times the last two years they're getting ready to do it again if
[11:11.760 --> 11:15.200]  you just give us trillions more and have your government sign over any
[11:15.200 --> 11:20.200]  sovereignty that's left to the private ECB European Central Bank this is all in
[11:20.200 --> 11:24.240]  the news unfolding and then they announced they're so arrogant they think
[11:24.240 --> 11:28.760]  you're so stupid they then go up and crow you know like a crow or a rooster
[11:28.760 --> 11:34.200]  like you know rooster gets up on the fence right at sunrise 530 and goes
[11:34.200 --> 11:41.240]  cockle doodle do that's what male birds do a male peacocks do it and they they
[11:41.240 --> 11:50.480]  climb up cockle doodle do you're my slave you're my slave you're my bitch you're
[11:50.480 --> 11:55.960]  my you're my hoe I'm your pimp excuse me using those terms but that's what
[11:55.960 --> 12:04.240]  they're doing and I don't like it I don't like them getting up and announcing
[12:04.240 --> 12:11.920]  that we're their female dogs I don't like them hiking their legs on us so this
[12:11.920 --> 12:16.960]  is the type of news that we see just pouring out and and and as soon as they
[12:16.960 --> 12:21.080]  get it'll and it's all being announced it's already being implemented in
[12:21.080 --> 12:26.480]  California it's statewide cities like Austin so they're doing it it's states
[12:26.480 --> 12:31.440]  like California states like New York are putting their carbon taxes in their
[12:31.440 --> 12:36.040]  different names well California calls it a carbon tax a footprint a carbon
[12:36.040 --> 12:42.120]  footprint tax and you notice that other countries like Australia have now put it
[12:42.120 --> 12:47.560]  in and by the way in Australia they arrest you if you criticize it boy I
[12:47.560 --> 12:52.520]  thought Australia was a free country by the way we put drudge report calm up on
[12:52.520 --> 12:57.240]  screen for folks you'll notice up in the right hand corner if we center that
[12:57.240 --> 13:03.920]  just a little bit it says land of the free and up there in the left hand
[13:03.920 --> 13:13.680]  corner and it goes over a group of reports that are being reported on there
[13:13.680 --> 13:22.000]  and it says woman arrested for writing manatee man jailed for four days for
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.240]  recording cops company fires a hundred and fifty employees for not getting
[13:28.240 --> 13:32.320]  flu shots school district requiring students to wear microchips to track
[13:32.320 --> 13:42.240]  every move and of course palm scanners and schools and hospitals and you
[13:42.240 --> 13:53.840]  notice that one of those articles there on the site is a story we posted info
[13:53.840 --> 13:59.800]  wars calm by a group that breaks down the fact a group of journalists that it
[13:59.800 --> 14:04.720]  is not illegal to film the police and I want to get them on the show and right
[14:04.720 --> 14:08.200]  there on that site they have countless examples if you link through in our
[14:08.200 --> 14:14.800]  article to the site of the exact name of it is it is not illegal to film the
[14:14.800 --> 14:25.480]  police but let me just find it here I had it here in my stack it doesn't matter
[14:25.480 --> 14:29.160]  you take it down you can't read the left-hand side so just now there it is
[14:29.160 --> 14:36.520]  California man jailed or recording cops and that's from P I N A C that's the
[14:36.520 --> 14:40.120]  website if you click on that blue link right there Carlos Miller you can go see

[14:45.640 --> 14:53.480]  P I N A C stands for and it just integrates in with a new article out
[14:53.480 --> 14:59.520]  today by Paul Joseph Watson US Army soldier arrested by police for asking
[14:59.520 --> 15:04.520]  questions Georgia man was filming cops during traffic stop so they arrested him
[15:04.520 --> 15:11.600]  he's very polite which you don't even have to be by law and he still goes to
[15:11.600 --> 15:16.760]  jail because he the police officer because the guy pulled into a church
[15:16.760 --> 15:20.520]  parking lot off the road and the cops wanted to tell him now leave this
[15:20.520 --> 15:24.160]  parking lot as if the guy wasn't gonna leave the parking lot when he pulled off
[15:24.160 --> 15:30.360]  the road and the man says what is this not a public place and the cops says
[15:30.360 --> 15:35.400]  that's it you're going to jail and again that's what you'd expect in North
[15:35.400 --> 15:40.400]  Korea that's not what you'd expect in a free society and and I did cover the
[15:40.400 --> 15:47.760]  good news yesterday that the cop in the town actually in a wealthy neighborhood
[15:47.760 --> 15:54.000]  there in a major city in Oklahoma the neighbors saw the three-year-old pee up
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.080]  against a tree and you know I've been at the beach when my children have been
[15:59.080 --> 16:03.680]  two or three years old and they it just seems natural you know they'll you look

[16:25.080 --> 16:32.880]  of news ok.com Piedmont officer fired over public urination ticket that's what
[16:32.880 --> 16:37.680]  we need to see police departments need to find out who control freaks are who
[16:37.680 --> 16:45.280]  petty thugs are and fire them fire them what you want is professional people
[16:45.280 --> 16:51.000]  that really want to serve the community and want to go after bad guys who want
[16:51.000 --> 16:56.360]  to find the people all over the country breaking into folks houses robbing
[16:56.360 --> 17:01.760]  their garages the carjackers I mean I can take you right now and I intend to
[17:01.760 --> 17:04.800]  do this soon as I get the time or I'm gonna see I don't want to send my
[17:04.800 --> 17:11.320]  reporters out because I wouldn't ask them to do this though I I know my
[17:11.320 --> 17:15.000]  reporters would do it they've got a lot of courage if you I could go to East
[17:15.000 --> 17:21.000]  Austin right now anywhere in a 20-mile square area or more it's even bigger
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.880]  than that and I can show you prostitutes and crack dealers right now but you
[17:26.880 --> 17:31.200]  don't see police anywhere but I can take you I can show you people selling
[17:31.200 --> 17:41.040]  crack cocaine all day and selling their bodies all day because I for a decade I
[17:41.040 --> 17:44.440]  haven't really done a show in six seven eight years much I've been out there a
[17:44.440 --> 17:48.400]  few times as a guest I went down to access TV and part of that community
[17:48.400 --> 17:53.800]  program was to build city projects and government buildings in East Austin and
[17:53.800 --> 17:58.680]  so I would drive over there and no matter what round I took I would have
[17:58.680 --> 18:03.120]  crack dealers run up to the car window when I was at a red light I would have
[18:03.120 --> 18:06.840]  women that looked like they were from day of the dead literally with you know
[18:06.840 --> 18:12.280]  no hair looking like zombies you know stumbling around the few times I was
[18:12.280 --> 18:17.160]  dumb enough to get gasoline in those areas you know offering to perform sex
[18:17.160 --> 18:22.200]  acts on me and I had my car robbed repeatedly in the parking lot and other
[18:22.200 --> 18:28.720]  people have their windows knocked out and robbed in the parking lot and so I've
[18:28.720 --> 18:33.000]  I've experienced it and I have occasionally driven back through the
[18:33.000 --> 18:40.320]  area and it is street fights going on openly people being stabbed in fact so
[18:40.320 --> 18:44.000]  many times I would drive over there to do to edit at night or whatever and there'd
[18:44.000 --> 18:50.960]  be cops with white you know white sheets over people dead people dead being
[18:50.960 --> 18:53.800]  loaded I probably saw that five six times I mean I you know where you actually
[18:53.800 --> 18:58.800]  see the body one time was even a big red spot on the on the gurney and you could
[18:58.800 --> 19:02.640]  see them you know blood dripping out of the dead body the you'd be in a red
[19:02.640 --> 19:07.080]  light watching dead people being loaded into ambulances that mean that's all
[19:07.080 --> 19:11.960]  going on right now but don't worry we're gonna arrest a woman for posting on
[19:11.960 --> 19:14.880]  her Facebook a photo of her with a manatee because the manatees come up to
[19:14.880 --> 19:20.240]  you there are sea cows mermaids as the Spanish called them you know they're
[19:20.240 --> 19:22.440]  very they'll come over to your boat whatever we've you pat them you're going

[24:42.760 --> 24:47.240]  remain secret Google engineers knew for two years at the company Street View

[25:19.760 --> 25:23.520]  the election fraud that all points towards Obama engaging in fraud and you
[25:23.520 --> 25:27.000]  know me folks I just report the facts it's not that he would have saved us it's
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.760]  Romney it's at the system wanted Obama and now you got Jamie Foxx calling him
[25:31.760 --> 25:36.880]  our Lord and Savior they did that four years ago seriously during the campaign
[25:36.880 --> 25:40.160]  you remember I covered that in the Obama deception that's even more important
[25:40.160 --> 25:46.200]  today than ever that film and these people really think free cars free houses
[25:46.200 --> 25:50.360]  everything it's designed to bankrupt us and I'm gonna talk about that at the
[25:50.360 --> 25:53.240]  start of the next segment and then start going to your phone calls after I
[25:53.240 --> 25:59.480]  break down Rand Paul and his calls for basic amnesty and give you my take on
[25:59.480 --> 26:05.360]  that here is some of the other news Soros and Paulson are back to Goldrush
[26:05.360 --> 26:10.280]  about six months ago they said buy it because they were busy buying it and then
[26:10.280 --> 26:13.640]  they said dump it so they can manipulate the market now they're rushing back in
[26:13.640 --> 26:18.040]  again in gold obviously is way up there's some of those reports Soros and
[26:18.040 --> 26:23.040]  Paulson are back to Goldrush RT here's Bloomberg Soros buying gold as record
[26:23.040 --> 26:29.600]  at prices seen on stimulus why buying gold after Paulson and Soros is foolish
[26:29.600 --> 26:37.320]  is what Forbes is saying and here's another one George Soros buys millions
[26:37.320 --> 26:42.880]  in gold continuing billionaire Soros Paulson get big on gold ABC news so
[26:42.880 --> 26:48.280]  that's just some of the stuff came out in the last few days here's some of the
[26:48.280 --> 26:57.200]  top stories at info wars.com if you go to the site in the featured news area US
[26:57.200 --> 27:01.680]  army soldier arrested by police for asking questions already mentioned that
[27:01.680 --> 27:05.400]  I'm gonna cover that more also want to play some clips of this during the show
[27:05.400 --> 27:08.080]  today if not it'll be on the nightly news tonight because he said this before
[27:08.080 --> 27:12.400]  but now he's intensifying it there's a big new Brzezinski who's a top globalist
[27:12.400 --> 27:17.320]  planner not an owner but one of their top generals one of their ringwraiths
[27:17.320 --> 27:23.640]  populist resistance is derailing the New World Order and and what is the New
[27:23.640 --> 27:28.800]  World Order will will break that down a technocratic scientific tyranny designed
[27:28.800 --> 27:33.880]  to reduce your life expectancy and fertility to remove you the globalist
[27:33.880 --> 27:37.520]  stole the world now they want you out of the way you expect me to talk gold
[27:37.520 --> 27:45.960]  finger no mr. Bond I expect you to die will be peak of the solar cycle in 2013
[27:45.960 --> 27:50.080]  produced technology crippling solar storms NASA says that's a possibility
[27:50.080 --> 27:54.720]  Cuba of Venezuela Russia and China now more free than America in notable ways
[27:54.720 --> 28:01.600]  Mike Adams has an excellent report in the ultimate media war governments
[28:01.600 --> 28:06.400]  target reporters Washington blog breaks that down and that ties that in to
[28:06.400 --> 28:11.800]  reporters everywhere I mean in some cases you can be 200 yards away filming
[28:11.800 --> 28:17.600]  police in rural areas major cities and they come over and arrest you and they
[28:17.600 --> 28:20.680]  don't care that courts rule obviously against them and they lose lawsuits
[28:20.680 --> 28:24.800]  because it's taxpayer money that just further bankrupts things to the foreign
[28:24.800 --> 28:29.840]  banks and again you know if you want your three-year-old arrested for paying in
[28:29.840 --> 28:35.080]  the front yard or if you want parents arrested for the ten-year-old playing in
[28:35.080 --> 28:40.880]  the front yard they're saying that's negligence now and endangerment I mean

[33:41.720 --> 33:48.000]  be live on December 21st supposedly the end of the world I am saying it is not
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.720]  gonna be the end of the world I'm saying you might have a few cults commit
[33:51.720 --> 33:57.640]  suicide on that date and I know the mainstream media will say that I said
[33:57.640 --> 34:01.520]  the world would end on that date and I know they will edit shows together to
[34:01.520 --> 34:07.600]  make it sound like that and that's just what they do the reason I know is they've
[34:07.600 --> 34:12.080]  already done it I've already in the last couple years seen I don't know how many
[34:12.080 --> 34:17.280]  articles it's it's it's it's more than 20 probably more than 30 but it's quite a
[34:17.280 --> 34:22.520]  few news pieces on television and articles saying people like Alex Jones
[34:22.520 --> 34:28.760]  that thinks space aliens are gonna land people like Alex Jones who believe the
[34:28.760 --> 34:36.120]  world is going to end in December 2012 I've never said that and again I don't
[34:36.120 --> 34:39.840]  sit here and occasionally talk about this because I'm too obsessed over what's
[34:39.840 --> 34:45.680]  said about yours truly it shows how the mainstream media thinks you're stupid
[34:45.680 --> 34:52.920]  they think you're dumb and they tailor their propaganda at the lowest common
[34:52.920 --> 34:59.480]  denominator level and I don't think I know it's backfiring if you look at all
[34:59.480 --> 35:05.240]  the numbers you see it out there television cable mainstream media
[35:05.240 --> 35:10.480]  websites no it's not just web that's killing mainline television or mainline
[35:10.480 --> 35:16.680]  print it's alternative web is killing the dinosaur corporate globalist media
[35:16.680 --> 35:20.880]  the establishment left and the establishment right that controlled
[35:20.880 --> 35:25.360]  false choice is falling apart as Ron Paul said two weeks ago he said we have
[35:25.360 --> 35:30.280]  state-run media in fact I want to do a nightly news report I'm doing the nightly
[35:30.280 --> 35:37.800]  news what tomorrow I want to do a whole report breaking down the proof that we
[35:37.800 --> 35:43.080]  have state-run media because I don't think people understand how much
[35:43.080 --> 35:50.600]  money it's it's in the hundreds of billions of dollars I saw a report a
[35:50.600 --> 35:56.720]  few months ago where ten billion dollars was being spent a year just to
[35:56.720 --> 36:06.320]  promote Obamacare messages in dramas sitcoms and shows on TV ten billion
[36:06.320 --> 36:12.800]  dollars what was the number eight point two billion was spent by Bush over two
[36:12.800 --> 36:18.400]  years to promote no child left behind federalization of testing to take over
[36:18.400 --> 36:22.400]  the schools to make sure they're dumbing them down properly and to federalize
[36:22.400 --> 36:30.520]  everything and you know all of that kind of just ended oh you know one
[36:30.520 --> 36:37.280]  commentator got two hundred and forty five thousand dollars one conservative
[36:37.280 --> 36:43.240]  black commentator to promote it to his radio audience no it was eight plus
[36:43.240 --> 36:50.200]  billion dollars and the and the different oversight groups in Congress you
[36:50.200 --> 36:56.160]  know had hearings and there was the New York Times headline Congress rules fake
[36:56.160 --> 37:06.440]  news illegal that guys type that in Congress rules fake news illegal and I
[37:06.440 --> 37:11.240]  think it was GAO also did a report on it but I mean the the snapshot was eight
[37:11.240 --> 37:20.400]  billion the snapshot on government pays for pro Obama messages pro Obamacare
[37:20.400 --> 37:26.600]  mess folks that isn't a free country let me give you a little newsflash here but
[37:26.600 --> 37:33.640]  see you got all the paid media over a hundred billion a year one way or another
[37:34.160 --> 37:39.120]  and a hundred billion is my number I mean if you add it all together different
[37:39.120 --> 37:43.320]  government PSA propaganda last time I checked some numbers that about an hour
[37:43.320 --> 37:48.760]  of re-research I say re-research so I kind of thin slice this stuff integrated
[37:48.760 --> 37:53.920]  all together as a guesstimation it's like I said a few weeks ago UT has over a
[37:53.920 --> 37:56.560]  hundred billion dollars in assets I went and looked it up it was way over that
[37:56.560 --> 38:00.800]  they got public numbers of 20 billion and stuff but it's it's way over that if
[38:00.800 --> 38:04.000]  you look at the comprehensive annual financial reports I mean there are
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.440]  cities that have got over a hundred billion like Dallas but again I'm now
[38:09.440 --> 38:13.680]  digressing yeah you heard me a hundred billion there are some water districts in
[38:13.680 --> 38:18.280]  the state where I live it I've over a billion dollars just in liquid funds but
[38:18.280 --> 38:25.680]  oh but they need tax increases they take your tax money and invested in offshore
[38:25.680 --> 38:32.080]  derivatives do you understand that and then leverage it against you again but
[38:32.080 --> 38:38.080]  you know I always give the number out and then just enter the the minotaurs
[38:38.080 --> 38:45.560]  maze of news and then never get out how did I get off into all this oh yeah I was
[38:45.560 --> 38:50.960]  just gonna have a little intro here about government tyranny and why I wanted
[38:50.960 --> 38:55.800]  to get the head of the UK Independence Party on there's a very busy man Nigel
[38:55.800 --> 39:02.600]  Farage what an impressive statesman say he's the Ron Paul of Europe and of course
[39:02.600 --> 39:08.040]  who founded the party with him Lord Moncton who we who is accessible it's very
[39:08.040 --> 39:11.280]  hard to get Farage on because he's just in meetings constantly and back and
[39:11.280 --> 39:17.680]  forth across the English Channel he's in the European Union Parliament I mean
[39:17.680 --> 39:21.680]  almost died a few years ago in that mysterious plane crash the pilot is
[39:21.680 --> 39:28.680]  basically brain damage now and in bad shape but that's a side issue you thought
[39:28.680 --> 39:33.600]  when they took the three kids from the family well-to-do upstanding family of
[39:33.600 --> 39:39.440]  the libertarian UKIP party I mean mainline conservative libertarian not
[39:39.440 --> 39:43.720]  even as radical as Ron Paul really if you call that radical and they took their
[39:43.720 --> 39:48.880]  kids and this is in the one in Telegraph they are not apologizing oh yeah they
[39:48.880 --> 39:53.840]  take conservatives kids now in England saying it's mentally ill folks this is
[39:53.840 --> 39:57.600]  the beginning of the reeducation camps England's just a few years ahead of us
[39:57.600 --> 40:01.880]  so there's that headline
[40:04.120 --> 40:09.960]  okay let me just stop there and give you my take on Rand Paul and then we'll go
[40:09.960 --> 40:12.680]  to your phone calls
[40:13.920 --> 40:19.240]  ladies and gentlemen Rand Paul is positioning himself to run for president
[40:19.240 --> 40:25.520]  I have known Rand Paul for I don't know 14 15 years because I would interview
[40:25.520 --> 40:30.440]  Ron Paul once a month you know going back to 1996 I would routinely interview
[40:30.440 --> 40:38.720]  Ron Paul hundreds of times and a lot of times if Ron Paul was in a close race
[40:38.720 --> 40:43.360]  which hadn't happened for a long time he usually went one with over 65% of the
[40:43.360 --> 40:47.120]  vote in South Texas but early on sometimes in some of his first
[40:47.120 --> 40:52.440]  congressional reelection races it was pretty close and and they pulled out the
[40:52.440 --> 40:56.200]  stops against the Republican Party as well as the Democrats so they would call
[40:56.200 --> 41:02.600]  and say hey you had the congressman on last week how about his son so I'm
[41:02.600 --> 41:08.880]  proud of the fact that I've known Rand Paul longer than most people out there
[41:08.880 --> 41:11.640]  have I was talking to Lou Rockwell off the air the other day we had a little
[41:11.640 --> 41:16.360]  little meeting about things off air and you know I was saying how much I like
[41:16.360 --> 41:20.760]  Rand Paul and he was talking about how much he likes him and that we wish he
[41:20.760 --> 41:27.200]  was totally stubborn like his father well I was saying that but that you know
[41:27.200 --> 41:32.640]  he's a good guy and that you know clearly and I was saying yeah you know I'm
[41:32.640 --> 41:37.080]  just honored to have known him so long he said I've known him since he was 10
[41:37.080 --> 41:42.680]  years old you know over at my house eating dinner because Lou Rockwell of
[41:42.680 --> 41:45.400]  course was the chief of staff for Ron Paul and encouraged him to run for
[41:45.400 --> 41:51.240]  Congress originally and we were talking about it and we were talking about the
[41:51.240 --> 41:54.760]  fact that's it's well known but Rand has since said yes he does want to run for
[41:54.760 --> 42:05.760]  president in 2016 and I will support him in 2016 currently I currently I will
[42:05.760 --> 42:17.960]  support him but we've got to be asking the question here do we do we want to
[42:17.960 --> 42:24.160]  play patty cake with the power structure do we want to do things that the power
[42:24.160 --> 42:30.960]  structure sees as favorable so that they will a not block Rand Paul and be not
[42:30.960 --> 42:37.280]  assassinating and that's a discussion that has to be had the
[42:37.280 --> 42:41.280]  collectivist are very afraid of him and demonized him in the campaign the
[42:41.280 --> 42:44.280]  Democrats did and well first the Republicans and then and then the
[42:44.280 --> 42:48.280]  Democrats in Kentucky but the Republicans did something smart when
[42:48.280 --> 42:53.280]  Rand Paul beat them and their banker backed candidate Mitch McConnell came in
[42:53.280 --> 42:57.760]  and said okay now we're gonna help you son and and I know that Jesse Benton and
[42:57.760 --> 43:02.400]  I know that Jack Hunter I know others got have gotten Rand Paul too cozy with
[43:02.400 --> 43:06.600]  the Republicans I think he should be congenial and things like that but I
[43:06.600 --> 43:11.200]  think he should be like his father and be hardcore and not compromising and
[43:11.200 --> 43:16.600]  even if he doesn't win the presidency the presidency doesn't matter if you
[43:16.600 --> 43:23.960]  don't win it your way and when the system attacks you more and more that's a
[43:23.960 --> 43:29.080]  badge of courage that's a certification that you're good you don't want the
[43:29.080 --> 43:35.720]  establishment to say nice things about you and if he would have taken on the
[43:35.720 --> 43:41.400]  mantle of his father which he has not done if I guess he wants to show he's
[43:41.400 --> 43:47.280]  his own man well if your dad wasn't so amazing I mean maybe he'll be your own
[43:47.280 --> 43:54.640]  man but I think Rand Paul's making a mistake in general terms I'll leave it
[43:54.640 --> 43:59.400]  at that in the things he's doing I would not meet with Peter Thiel remember
[43:59.400 --> 44:03.200]  the Bilderberg group I would not take two and a half million dollars from him
[44:03.200 --> 44:07.760]  because the globalist know libertarianism is the way of the future they
[44:07.760 --> 44:12.080]  want to co-opt it after they steal everything and I'm not even saying Thiel's
[44:12.080 --> 44:15.720]  done that himself but the globalist I mean you know that's a group that makes
[44:15.720 --> 44:21.680]  their money out of organized planned inside job crony capitalist monopoly
[44:21.680 --> 44:27.160]  capitalist models while socializing us at the grassroots so I'll say right now I
[44:27.160 --> 44:36.120]  think that's a mistake in fact I know it's a mistake and you know coming out
[44:36.120 --> 44:39.960]  and saying decriminalized marijuana that's a positive thing calling for
[44:39.960 --> 44:43.520]  stage rights that's a positive thing calling for the end of the Patriot Act
[44:43.520 --> 44:47.280]  and the secret arrest of Americans under NDAA and saying Obama shouldn't be
[44:47.280 --> 44:53.800]  staying the UN is over our military that's great things so overall Rand Paul
[44:53.800 --> 44:59.200]  is is is doing a lot of really important things and he's he's he's the best we've
[44:59.200 --> 45:04.160]  got in the US Senate so I like Rand Paul but that doesn't mean I'm an occult
[45:04.160 --> 45:09.240]  here and that I'm not going to talk about issues that I have with some of the
[45:09.240 --> 45:15.000]  things he's doing now that said I want to explain here where I stand on
[45:15.000 --> 45:21.560]  immigration very clearly not from a political perspective but from a real
[45:21.560 --> 45:28.080]  geopolitical level not what we want to believe not with what's popular not with
[45:28.080 --> 45:35.000]  what the media is out there pushing but the reality
[45:35.000 --> 45:40.880]  here's a quote from Rand Paul in statements last Friday we're getting
[45:40.880 --> 45:45.440]  an ever dwindling percent of the Hispanic vote Paul says we have to let
[45:45.440 --> 45:49.840]  people know Hispanics in particular we're not going to put you on a bus and
[45:49.840 --> 45:57.560]  ship you home and that's a statement and it goes on and he has said we need to
[45:57.560 --> 46:11.800]  find continuing here a path towards quote eventual legalization okay the the
[46:11.800 --> 46:15.200]  program that Bush brought up three times and then tried to keep secret the
[46:15.200 --> 46:19.480]  third time but senator sessions released when legalized the 30 million
[46:19.480 --> 46:23.200]  illegals that's the real number and then let them legalize their family and
[46:23.200 --> 46:30.360]  bring them in and before I get into all of that because that's the Republican
[46:30.360 --> 46:34.400]  plan that's being pushed that's what Boehner says you notice the Republicans
[46:34.400 --> 46:38.200]  now say oh we're gonna be for tax increases because the banksters want
[46:38.200 --> 46:43.880]  that money for more bailouts so so let's talk the facts here first the media
[46:43.880 --> 46:48.920]  shells it that all Hispanics want open borders and it becomes a self-fulfilling
[46:48.920 --> 46:55.400]  prophecy that well of your for Raza the race no other group is allowed to talk
[46:55.400 --> 46:59.200]  like that it's not because the globalists like Hispanics or Latinos they hate
[46:59.200 --> 47:09.400]  everybody it's that they want to use the what is it 600 million that can easily
[47:09.400 --> 47:14.440]  get to the United States 120 million in Mexico what's the total population I
[47:14.440 --> 47:17.960]  meant to look this up this morning I was 600 million that are easily accessible
[47:17.960 --> 47:22.640]  to get into the US but that's only counting a small portion what's the
[47:22.640 --> 47:27.480]  total population of Latin America Google total use the NSA search engine total
[47:27.480 --> 47:33.560]  population of Latin America give me that number I know it's close to 800
[47:33.560 --> 47:38.560]  million the point is you got hundreds and hundreds of millions of people who
[47:38.560 --> 47:43.120]  come from incredibly corrupt third-world colonial systems who want to come here
[47:43.120 --> 47:51.440]  and the government I covered this yesterday has websites saying come here
[47:51.440 --> 47:55.280]  and have your babies for free come here and get free welfare the illegals are
[47:55.280 --> 47:59.080]  allowed to get as many tax ID numbers they want and get as many welfare checks
[47:59.080 --> 48:04.560]  as they want one home in Austin got tens of millions of dollars we've covered
[48:04.560 --> 48:08.960]  all of this it's been in the news you've seen it the news and it's all left
[48:08.960 --> 48:14.400]  alone why is that it's economic warfare to drive down the wages to bankrupt the
[48:14.400 --> 48:23.440]  country and to create giant client groups that will vote for socialism
[48:23.440 --> 48:27.560]  because they perceive they're getting an Obama phone
[48:29.360 --> 48:37.840]  guys you can just 500 572 million yeah the number I've got though is if you
[48:37.840 --> 48:41.440]  count all the other Caribbean islands and the rest of it I've seen some
[48:41.440 --> 48:46.000]  estimates perhaps I think they're saying by the end of okay we've got that so
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.440]  it's it's getting close to 600 million it's my original but I've seen some
[48:49.440 --> 48:52.160]  estimates perhaps they're saying 800 million by the end of the decade but
[48:52.160 --> 48:58.240]  the point is you've got 600 plus million people that want to come here and it'd
[48:58.240 --> 49:01.680]  be one thing if we took 30 million on and there was no welfare it would be a
[49:01.680 --> 49:05.040]  probably a boom for the country and a lot of folks from Latin America will
[49:05.040 --> 49:08.400]  work hard Americans have had liberty so long I don't care what color they are a
[49:08.400 --> 49:11.680]  lot of Americans have gotten lazy a lot of Americans are still the hardest
[49:11.680 --> 49:14.640]  working people in the world whether you're Hispanic black white Asian
[49:14.640 --> 49:18.640]  whatever the case is but you've got people coming here and the ideology in
[49:18.640 --> 49:22.560]  the public schools the universities is we're going to take America over
[49:22.560 --> 49:27.440]  we're going to do all this la raza you can't wear American flags la reconquista
[49:27.440 --> 49:33.600]  la infosora la reconquer all of this and everybody knows this is going on and
[49:33.600 --> 49:37.520]  it's also the globalists get a voting block
[49:37.520 --> 49:42.560]  so a this won't help Hispanics long term b it will just collapse North America
[49:42.560 --> 49:46.560]  like Latin America has collapsed and you can't say
[49:46.560 --> 49:50.400]  oh we want to be friendly yes we want Latino votes
[49:50.400 --> 49:54.960]  so we'll be for legalization and then oh we will legalize the next group too
[49:54.960 --> 49:59.840]  because we want to get Latino votes they've been sold on average
[49:59.840 --> 50:03.920]  now you're getting what 80% or so calling themselves socialists that are voting
[50:03.920 --> 50:10.720]  who are quote Latino what become linen so you get elected that's Marxism in
[50:10.720 --> 50:13.840]  Latin America what become Hugo Chavez
[50:13.840 --> 50:17.760]  Rand and the globalists it probably puts you in if you came and now she wanted
[50:17.760 --> 50:20.800]  communism and the bankers would sit offshore siphoning off
[50:20.800 --> 50:24.720]  the majority of the money this is the plan so
[50:24.720 --> 50:27.840]  you can't go to lawbreakers I mean we already have the most open country in
[50:27.840 --> 50:30.320]  the world the government gives the people free
[50:30.320 --> 50:33.920]  healthcare come here and have your babies that's on the official government
[50:33.920 --> 50:39.120]  websites we can't do this
[50:39.120 --> 50:42.880]  and this is the idea now they go oh Obama won
[50:42.880 --> 50:47.280]  that's a mandate for open borders that's the globalist that's the new world
[50:47.280 --> 50:50.800]  order that's the end of this country and
[50:50.800 --> 50:54.480]  they've sold the idea that you're anti-Hispanic if you don't want open
[50:54.480 --> 50:57.920]  countries really Mexico you open yourself up the rest of Latin America

[54:30.880 --> 54:35.680]  and the rest of the news and Bev Harris joins us at the bottom of the hour
[54:35.680 --> 54:39.840]  but continuing here I started talking about state-run media earlier at start
[54:39.840 --> 54:44.000]  of the next segment and then digressed off into a bunch of other issues but we
[54:44.000 --> 54:48.240]  really do have a state-run media more and more
[54:48.240 --> 54:53.040]  but running parallel to the alternative media which is independent
[54:53.040 --> 54:57.520]  shoestring budget but it doesn't matter because we become so popular
[54:57.520 --> 55:03.360]  not just mfallwars.com or prismbonnet.com but many other sites
[55:03.360 --> 55:07.200]  and because you have supported us the system now openly says they want a
[55:07.200 --> 55:11.200]  censor and shut down the real media so we shouldn't
[55:11.200 --> 55:14.720]  even call ourselves the alternative media we're the real media
[55:14.720 --> 55:18.320]  we're the people's media versus state-run media
[55:18.320 --> 55:23.520]  and you've got to start seeing it like that because that's what it is
[55:23.520 --> 55:27.920]  they don't like the fact that you can go to prismplanet.tv and see a well
[55:27.920 --> 55:31.600]  produced nightly news show they don't like the fact
[55:31.600 --> 55:37.680]  that you can go to drudgereport.com and that he can link to one of our videos
[55:37.680 --> 55:41.040]  or someone else's and take something obscure
[55:41.040 --> 55:46.320]  and make it the issue in the country. They're not controlling the narrative
[55:46.320 --> 55:50.400]  as Hillary Clinton said last year they're losing the info war against the
[55:50.400 --> 55:53.200]  people. Brzezinski said it two years ago and
[55:53.200 --> 55:57.440]  said it again over the weekend at a prestigious conference
[55:57.440 --> 56:01.520]  he said the globalists are losing control populist movements will overthrow
[56:01.520 --> 56:05.760]  global government because your global government is an
[56:05.760 --> 56:09.680]  authoritarian nightmare you may get a bunch of mainline
[56:09.680 --> 56:13.040]  well-meaning liberals to sign on to authoritarian world government
[56:13.040 --> 56:18.000]  because they believe in making people do things for the greater good
[56:18.560 --> 56:22.240]  but we know you're not even trying to make us do things for the greater good
[56:22.240 --> 56:25.760]  that's bad enough we know you're premeditated and evil
[56:25.760 --> 56:30.880]  and we're exposing you the signal's already been sent
[56:30.880 --> 56:34.640]  it's like we've already stabbed the globalist about 50 times in the stomach
[56:34.640 --> 56:37.920]  their guts are hanging out they're still moving forward on adrenaline
[56:37.920 --> 56:40.960]  by the way they're stabbing us too this is a fight to the death i hope
[56:40.960 --> 56:44.800]  everybody knows that and every time we shove
[56:44.800 --> 56:49.760]  the stiletto the big eyes pick into their guts
[56:49.760 --> 56:52.800]  whoever wants it most
[56:53.280 --> 56:57.120]  whoever's left standing will then be re-energized like the phoenix
[56:57.120 --> 57:02.560]  that's how political systems work and we're in the fight of our lives you
[57:02.560 --> 57:05.280]  need to understand that
[57:05.680 --> 57:10.000]  and the more they get oppressive now the more it's going to backfire on them
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.400]  unless they can totally take over and that window's closing on them
[57:14.400 --> 57:16.960]  but they don't care they're going to just throw fits
[57:16.960 --> 57:21.920]  and try to overrun us not going to work because all the zombies
[57:21.920 --> 57:25.040]  don't look at the zombies the dumbed-down slobbering public
[57:25.040 --> 57:28.800]  the poor victims of this and think oh my gosh they'll never fight the tyranny
[57:28.800 --> 57:31.600]  it's never been the general public that fights tyranny
[57:31.600 --> 57:36.720]  it's a tiny group of elite and then there's us and we are small compared to
[57:36.720 --> 57:42.320]  the majority but we are a throng an army
[57:42.320 --> 57:45.680]  there are tens of millions fully awake in the us
[57:45.680 --> 57:48.880]  hundreds of millions worldwide and our numbers are growing
[57:48.880 --> 57:54.240]  everyone i talk to that goes to europe or goes to latin america or goes to

[58:14.720 --> 58:18.880]  there are forces of good in this universe as well not just evil
[58:18.880 --> 58:22.880]  but you have got to stand up and be the leader you were born to be
[58:22.880 --> 58:25.920]  not who the globalist said you were they said you were a failure they said you
[58:25.920 --> 58:29.120]  were ugly they said you were pathetic stop believing that line

[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.880]  minutes but listen i've been beat up pretty bad by
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.680]  both sides the mainstream media is basically implied that i think the
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.480]  world's gonna end december 21st i've never said that
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:29.760]  i've always said it to hoax others get mad and say

[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:37.040]  supposed to kill me in 2000 or whatever
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.920]  and so we're going to your calls on this subject right now
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.960]  brice in um where you calling from brice
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.840]  hello hey buddy where you calling me from uh missouri i guess they didn't put it
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.960]  down no no i just i'm just out of it today go ahead
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.360]  yeah no problem uh yeah i agree yeah i think it's a hoax um
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.800]  this is one of the subjects of course that's addressed in the movie that i
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.280]  recommended you to see uh and uh this is brice in missouri the
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.360]  panacea for humankind guy but anyway the point is is
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:13.040]  you know it's just like white you quake k or any other apocalyptic
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.680]  uh end of the world scenario that people feed into it in some sick way they
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.800]  they want something like that to happen i mean if you think about all the films
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:26.000]  that are out there uh in the last not even 20 years but even beyond that uh
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.360]  of this apocalyptic end that's going to come in and here we are faced with
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:33.200]  another scenario uh it just puts people people into fear and it
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:37.280]  doesn't do anybody any good uh you know the truth of the matter is is
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.680]  that cod's in control and yeah there's going to eventually be a human
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:46.800]  history as we know it ending but not on our you know uh
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.400]  you know wisdom or anything like that this is something that we can't predict
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.800]  or or tell and this is why uh i was concerned about the rapture
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.080]  uh predicting predicament you know and and how
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.600]  i think that the government could have staged some type of false flag in that
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.000]  thinking that the end of the world's going to happen so
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.200]  you know my prayers of course are that the new world order
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:12.400]  uh doesn't do anything uh irrational or anything like that during that time
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.720]  uh but but again uh you know this is this is something that that society keeps
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:21.280]  feeding and and it's been going back hundreds and thousands of years
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.560]  well that's right the high priest would say
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:30.160]  give me more political power give me the nicest house bring me offerings of food
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.280]  because you know the you know the little god the little kona tiki god didn't
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.200]  actually eating the offerings of food and virgins
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.040]  yeah he is you know the high priest and his little priest class star
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:44.640]  and pretty soon you know the the the warriors have to go into the priest
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:49.280]  class or uh the the sun won't come back and that's
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.560]  basically what they do they use solar eclipses and things to scare people and
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:57.120]  now we see al gore doing the same thing today give me carbon taxes give me
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:01.280]  control uh or it's the uh end of the world if you
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:05.600]  don't do that very well said sir oh yeah thank you no problem
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.880]  just by a chance did you ever check out the film or a little bit of it
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.560]  no i i didn't appreciate your call i uh never got around to
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.040]  to that i think you've called like four times and gotten through to tell me
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.920]  about a film and i just you know that's kind of my problem is that there's so
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.120]  much going on that i get to the point where i can't
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.000]  even keep track of any of it um i don't really go and see
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.080]  entertainment films much anymore i don't really go out with friends anymore i
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.280]  don't do anything really except play with my children a little bit and then
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:39.280]  research uh reality has totally taken my world over
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:43.040]  and then i sit there and watch the whole fake reality go by
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:47.280]  like a train like i'm sitting there on the grass under a tree
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:52.880]  watching trains go by and uh in a way i guess i'm not in reality because i'm
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.080]  in reality to be in reality i have to be delusional
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:59.840]  and join in with people in the matrix

[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:19.200]  what began in the old one it has patterned itself after every dictator
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.280]  who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:27.040]  since the beginning of time it has refinements

[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:34.480]  of human freedom but like every one of the
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:39.120]  super states that preceded it it has one iron rule
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:50.880]  logic is an enemy and truth is a menace

[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.680]  coming up we've got the audio in the video taught globalists of big nevresenski
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:13.440]  has come out again and given a speech
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:18.320]  saying that the globalists are in deep trouble and populist movements are
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:24.880]  waking up to the new world order so that is coming up today
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:30.560]  we're also going to have uh in studio here with us the creators
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:34.080]  the designers of start page one of the biggest alternative
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.960]  search engines out there but we'll really use it as a way to investigate
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.120]  google and where google the nsa front company
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.720]  is going now i want to open the phones up for john
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:50.960]  and brendan and uh denang i believe and uh mike
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:54.000]  and others here because i want to spend some time over the next few weeks
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.120]  you know before the end of the world uh december 21st to talk about how that's
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:03.280]  a total hoax now that's my perspective i don't
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:06.880]  believe a planet x is going to hit a sort of comment or aliens are going to
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.320]  land if you actually read the mayan prophecy that i don't even put stock in
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.640]  to begin with and i've been i've been down to chichen
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:20.080]  nidsa akamal toloom you know more than 10 times in my life because my parents
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.200]  loved the vacation down there when i was a kid mainly but i've been back since
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:28.480]  back with my family a few years ago and i've gone to the extensive archaeological
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:31.600]  you know tour guide events you know the more in-depth ones and
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.400]  all of those mayan tour guides laugh and say well the prophecy says it's a new
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.440]  hearth or a new age not the end of the world
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:43.440]  and that is indeed what it says now they have the full tablets if you do put
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:47.120]  stock in that so it is a manufactured hoax put out by the
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:51.040]  globalists in the 60s and 70s just like they tell christians it's
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:58.240]  always the rapture in 1989 or 2011 it's a cop out so people say well i'm not
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.360]  going to say no to kids having to wear microchips to
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:05.520]  you know buy and sell at school or i'm not going to say no to the tsa groping
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.480]  little children i'm not going to say no to drones in the sky i'm not going to
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.320]  say no to face scanning to buy and sell i'm not going to say no to force
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:15.200]  inoculations i'm not going to say no to the announcement of world
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.600]  government it's biblical because it's the rapture
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:23.600]  and it's all just a giant cop out and and it's also
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.960]  linen and then Stalin said it again in a different way
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.480]  said that one person dies and the media can hype it up
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.960]  and make it a huge pageant and everybody will cry
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.400]  but 10 000 die it's a statistic and they know that
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:44.320]  you've got 50 million people roughly half of them children
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:50.240]  starving to death or dying from malnutrition dying from diseases that
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.200]  that that were caused by their malnutrition something like 30 plus
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:57.840]  million die of starvation itself half of those children and another 20 million
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.680]  or so from complications you can look up the latest numbers for yourself
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.280]  some estimates are lower some are higher but it's it's 50 million
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.760]  boy that's a pretty big deal 50 million
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:15.760]  million million is that an issue no it's not a lot of people say oh there are
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.800]  too many folks let them die well the point is that's going on
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:22.480]  and you see all these dramas and shows and discovery history channel shows about
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.680]  the world after humans and incaps at the bookstore the
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:29.040]  grocery store about it and how great it'll be without humans and
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.480]  oh we're going to merge with machines soon and oh there won't be any humans
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.440]  anymore the elite are going to get rid of us that's in lots of magazines and
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:38.400]  publications down and people reading go yeah they're going to get rid of us
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.440]  soon see it's gone from i'm a cook to just well what's
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:46.320]  wrong with that humans are scum you know you can't deny we're scum
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:50.480]  but for the new ages in people or i've seen the different polls out there even
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.640]  people that are agnostics or atheists they think something's going to happen
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:59.760]  next month so they don't believe in god but they
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:04.720]  think the world's going to end because somebody told him the Mayans said so
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:08.800]  so it's a way to divert us from the real problems
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:15.680]  that are really going on it is a total and complete
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:22.800]  scam and and it's also though a way to prepare people when there are mass
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.000]  plague releases that are meant to reduce the population
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.440]  down the road decades from now probably maybe sooner but
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.560]  definitely in the cards we're moving towards it here
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:36.320]  not away from it that it's a self-fulfilling
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.920]  race consciousness memory in the entire human race
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:44.320]  expecting this so that when it does happen
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:49.520]  people expect it and get in line so that is
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:54.320]  what the 2012 fraud hoax
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:01.840]  pantheon is all about in closing it is a cop out for people to not be involved
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:06.640]  and say oh it's the end of the world anyways it's a nihilistic attitude
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.840]  of that's just the way it is and so many nihilists
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:15.280]  are such cowards they buy in to everything is the end of the world
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.480]  and but when they're dying of liver failure or they're dying of something oh
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:21.440]  my god they they want it taken care of they want to
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:25.600]  live longer so so it's it's it's a very insecure
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:30.080]  childlike cop out and i'll tell christians this
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:33.520]  i'm not going to debate with you clearly the beast makes war on the saints and
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.360]  overcomes them clearly the rapture is after
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:40.240]  the devil is defeated i mean a five-year-old could read the bible
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:44.000]  and see that that's what it says it's after satan is thrown into the pit by the
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.840]  archangel tied with the big chain it's all clearly there that god comes back
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:54.720]  blows the trumpet the dead in christ and then all of this
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:59.360]  and it's an interpretation but in the last 150 years
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.760]  the big globalist funded preachers have taught everybody it's always the end
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.960]  of the world and germans german christians didn't fight hitler until
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.840]  later because they thought he was the antichrist the end of the world
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.440]  communist in russia thought linen and stoller both antichrist
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:19.600]  christians in kambodia thought pull pot was the antichrist
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:23.440]  and there are many antichrists there's an antichrist spirit ladies and gentlemen
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:27.200]  you've got to fight evil and now they say 501c3 churches
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.400]  render unto Caesar do whatever government says it's ordained by god
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.040]  really we're the government the declaration of independence bill of
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:37.280]  rights constitution is what we're supposed to follow
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:40.560]  it's godly government if it's ordained by god
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.560]  and following that but when government i've seen preachers on tv say
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:49.280]  the christians should have worshiped false idols and that they were sinning
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.120]  to be thrown to the lions this is the this is the
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:58.480]  teaching of devils you'd get more truth going to a satanic church
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:01.760]  because at least there they're being honest about what they stand for
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:05.600]  than one of these churches i mean i'll be honest with you
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:09.680]  because real satanism it doesn't have a picture of a hot blonde on the wall
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.960]  with some nerd with an egghead trying to act evil and scary
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:18.400]  some guy that if you caught him in an alley and pulled out a knife which
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:24.880]  and and showed them real evil because good can flip on the real switch
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:28.720]  would literally beg on their knees they don't know what evil is
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:34.080]  evil comes to you as friendly and loving and going to protect you
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:36.720]  it's going to keep you out of harm's way you're not going to have to face any
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:42.000]  adversity you're just going to have to
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.080]  give up your free will and join the collective
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:49.760]  and everything will be all right
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:56.880]  satanist are children they don't know anything about true evil
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:01.280]  let's go ahead and take a phone call john in texas your take on 2012 do you
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:04.960]  agree or disagree with me or what do you what what would you like to add
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.840]  i just think it's a tough question alex because the globe is the screwing the
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:12.000]  world up so bad if they were to launch an attack and i ran before new years and
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.320]  and and a chain reacted into a world war three with nuclear weapons flying
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:19.200]  it could be into the world and with them patrolling with these
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.600]  weather weapons and stuff i mean sergeant
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.200]  well i think that is the only proviso that i did not make
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:28.480]  and then i'm glad you raised but i've made that point before i'm just saying i
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:31.520]  agree with you that they've got weather weapons
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:35.200]  they've got so many other systems that they're so crazy
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.040]  that that they possibly could detonate any matter weapons which they admitted to
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.160]  the san francisco chronicle they had about seven years ago and i've confirmed
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:45.760]  they've had for at least 20 years they could destroy us with their fish
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:49.840]  infusion cyclotrons they're heavy superconducting super
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:53.360]  colliders their particle beam weapons their experiments
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:58.080]  yeah they could kill us anytime and and that'd be the end of it
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:02.080]  i had one one real quick question alex boyleaf yeah uh
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:05.440]  dr strange love why don't you ever play that clip where sterling hayden goes
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.320]  into a rant about fluoride i was a communist plot
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.080]  i thought that you know you'd have that on here you know i asked for that and i
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.680]  got it was and i don't think i was clear with it i said get me the dr strange
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:19.760]  love clip where uh general jack t ripper talks about
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:23.920]  fluoridating ice cream mandrake children's ice cream
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:26.880]  and i ended up getting the other clip which is interesting but yeah we should
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:29.760]  get that we're gonna start adding more movie clips to the show
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.680]  that's actually something i've got planned in my journal right there that
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:37.200]  i'm gonna try to launch in the next week uh but yes sir great great points
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:42.800]  anything else it really was a communist plot alex i know uh
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:47.680]  it's in um what two bullets surprise winning books
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:51.360]  uh what shares rise and fall third rike
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.240]  and one other it came out the nuremberg trials that
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:59.120]  during the the split up a poll and by the nazis and the and the uh soviets
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:03.760]  uh nazis visited this but this came out in in the hearings
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:07.520]  they visited soviet gulags and they noticed they were adding about five
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:11.440]  parts per million sodium fluoride to the water to make people docile
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:15.120]  so the nazis took it back yeah no it is a communist plot yeah
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:18.640]  mm-hmm because when i was when i was just started reading newspapers and like
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:21.920]  like 1950 1959 when i was about 10 years old
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:25.680]  when i just started that program then the newspapers were criticizing the john
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.640]  birch society because they were opposing it saying all those crazy john
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.280]  birchers well well exactly but but communism's
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.160]  only one floor that guys i'll grab it during the break
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:38.000]  john p holder and zico science that it's a eugenics plot

[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.440]  level above that and another level above that
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:47.120]  and uh yeah no it's we we live under a communist plot i mean look at it
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:50.640]  where we're by and large a communist country now with kind of a fascist

[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:20.240]  really began in every civilization why they develop the same why they always end up in human sacrifice
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:29.200]  and in summation it's because control freaks gravitate into positions of power a scam artist
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:38.720]  telling the tribe that they will make the the the crops grow they will keep the marauders away
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:47.120]  they will make the sun and moon come back from eclipses if the general population becomes their
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:52.320]  slaves and that's what al gore does i mean they get on the news like you're a primitive
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:58.480]  and they say you see that hurricane doesn't matter if there have been more than 20 that bad or worse
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:03.520]  that have hit in the last 400 years on the east coast that have flooded things out like that
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:12.880]  since the spanish discovered this area discovered it for europe it was a discovery europe it's kind
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.840]  of like if you didn't know the sun was outside you walked out discovered it was up there it
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:19.840]  doesn't mean others don't know it's there it's always get emails saying alex you know europeans
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:24.640]  didn't discover america it was here before that's arguing how many angels can dance on the head of a
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:31.600]  pin my point is i don't know people's brains work sometimes it just doesn't even matter uh the issue
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:38.320]  here is that that's what bloomberg says he says we need carbon taxes because of the hurricane pay
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:45.280]  the megabanks money and they will save you uh from the hurricane and then they say pay more
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:49.520]  taxes and government will save you from the hurricane and government still three weeks into
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:53.680]  the hurricane uh isn't helping people they're having to help themselves on the east coast
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:58.960]  just an example and that's what 2012 is it's just government witch doctors saying it's the end of
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:04.640]  the world so you don't bother to be involved because you think everything's over and then
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:10.000]  that makes you basically dead inside because you believe you're already dead which is just an
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.600]  example of how they want you to hate yourself think you're bad and think you're dead already so you
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:21.600]  just stand down and basically aren't a real person while they control human development
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:26.000]  that's what it's all about uh brendan in wisconsin thanks for holding you're on the air
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:32.560]  hey alex uh we talked down in chantilly at bilderberg and uh over thanksgiving i showed some
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:39.360]  of my uh relatives in indiana some of the talk to them about some of the footage that we took uh
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:47.040]  with you and erin and joe banister sturt roads and abby martin others and um uh we actually
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:52.400]  have made some headway around the uh thanksgiving dinner tables and talking with uh some of the
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:27:01.360]  family elders um about they were bringing up some christian points of family and unity thanksgiving
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:08.000]  and christmas and uh though i was not raised christian we all kind of came to agree that
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:14.720]  there is some sort of a spiritual warfare that is being conducted and uh sure you can call it a
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:20.800]  wavelength i mean they've proven that people know when someone's looking at them they've proven that
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:25.360]  there is a sixth sense they just don't understand it so so yes there are unseen things going on
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:32.000]  and my my sixth sense is very strong and so when you talk about your spidey sense i know exactly
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:38.240]  what you're talking about i didn't go into that with them but um there's i think kind of a central
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:44.720]  philosophy meeting point where uh many of your former guests like alfred did ask alan a lot
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:52.640]  david ike uh jordan maxwell fritz springmeyer would all kind of agree um with uh an author of a book
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:58.240]  that uh i think would complement the info wars store very well heard of an interview with him
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:03.680]  and i won't plug the the other radio show i don't care man just just watch the book okay it's all
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:10.240]  here's the deal i'm going to put you on hold we don't screen your calls unless we're having a
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:15.680]  particular topic and we go hey are you on topic but i may just start screening them because people
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:21.280]  want to be screened they want to be screened and they want to get on air and have a call screening
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:26.400]  with me on air and it's become one of my pet peeves uh i'm not trying to be mean here it just
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:30.960]  really is starting to punch my buttons just tell me the name of the book i don't need a big build
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:36.400]  up or provide those go ahead oh no no i won't then i i don't even need to mention it but the but
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:42.160]  that's what i was exploring well that's all right it wasn't my point actually my point is that that
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:49.040]  9 11 is a mass occult ritual was kind of the point of the book hold on a minute i want the book
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:56.560]  plugged see see i pretty look here's the deal i'm getting more i get really upset if things are totally
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:01.760]  illogical you can call it neurotic whatever you want i don't understand am i a bad communicator
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:07.520]  because you you you know you come on and then you say i don't want to plug something i go go
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:11.760]  ahead just i want to know the name what is it everyone listening does and then you won't tell
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:17.520]  me i appreciate your call it's not meant to happen thank you very much for the call i i just i just i
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:22.960]  don't know what's going on with people man i i it's weird because i guarantee you wouldn't
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:29.360]  have given it to us i mean it's just like a dance thing and i just won't i guess we've
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:37.600]  got to implement crawl screening uh just because it's what they want i mean to really talk to
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:42.800]  them to see if because you made a lot of good points but we all but the phones were open
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:51.520]  to talk about your take on 2012 so there's a dead ringer right there we're on the march

[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:28.240]  huge fan you were mean to him so i apologize the last caller but at the same time i'm like what's
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:33.200]  the name of the book no i don't want to do that i don't want to you know offend you and i'm like
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:38.800]  you're not offending me just tell me the name so it's not even that i'm mad at the last caller
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:44.640]  i'm just so tired of people getting on air and going is it okay if i talk about this is it okay
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:50.560]  if i talk about that man you're on air i know people lie and say that you know we have fake phone
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:55.040]  callers and that you can't really call in it's the opposite folks we have real phone callers
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:59.840]  you can really call into this show yeah bev harris coming up here in just a moment but let's go to
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:05.840]  mike in california mike on the 2012 topic you're on the air go ahead hey alex thanks for taking
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:12.000]  my call um i ended to uh attended a preparedness seminar a couple months back and they mentioned
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.920]  the great possibility of solar storms which like on um info wars right now there's that great article
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:23.600]  so what's interesting thing i heard was about the mine calendar and why they stopped creating it
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:28.880]  basically the speaker was suggesting that the coming solar storm would be so strong
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:34.240]  that it changes the tilt of the earth so it's not that the end of the world as we know it is coming
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:40.880]  if that time would change if we know it and um which is why they stopped making the calendar
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.920]  because no longer fit into the timeline of the last few thousand years that they had predicted
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:51.440]  and i guess with that you know the statement a new age and a new phase begins is less scary just
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:57.760]  you know be very prepared and don't be scared right well exactly what i'm saying is i don't
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:04.400]  think it's the end of the world the mayan prophecy is a new hearth you know one fire is put out a new
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:10.000]  fire is built even if you put stock in that but the globalists themselves they are running around
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.720]  digging in like it's the end of the world they are building bases they're doing all this but
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:18.880]  most of it is designed for it looks like a nuclear war with russia china or both
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:25.440]  great points i appreciate your call shifting gears now into something that we know is going on
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:31.680]  bev harris joins us has been a few weeks obviously since the election she's with blackbox voting.org
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:38.960]  she is the preeminent election fraud expert out there and we have one of the least transparent
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:43.920]  systems in the world international advisors we're here and said we just can't believe people just
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:49.200]  trust the system and she was on with this right after the election going over unprecedented
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:54.960]  anomalies uh to paraphrase what she said i wanted to recap it she said she's never seen this much
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:36:02.560]  just open announcing states before any votes that day were counted uh just you know just amazing
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:07.920]  things happening so joining us to run down now that we've got some time after the election
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:12.400]  for her to really be able to fair it around and investigate she's got a lot of breaking news for
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:17.120]  us today and i really appreciate bev harris taking time out to join us and then we'll go back to your
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:23.440]  calls then we have guests in studio folks uh bev harris thank you for coming on so hi alex you've
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:27.920]  got the floor tell us to kind of a recap and then what you've discovered since then oh my gosh you
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:34.640]  know it's just still pouring in but um there's some very very interesting statistical anomalies
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:39.840]  normally i don't get too excited about stats because they can have a lot of assumptions behind them
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:44.880]  but these are really interesting it looks like they withheld hundreds of thousands of votes
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:50.160]  actually nationwide it was millions of votes from the original counts now as you mentioned
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:55.360]  they called the election before counting but when they did release the original counts
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:01.120]  they had withheld millions of votes from that and what's really interesting is now that they're
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:07.600]  getting those votes finally counted there's a huge trend difference for example in some states
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:14.560]  it's a 30 percent difference in the last set of votes versus the first set of votes which you know
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:21.360]  why would that happen if all these random people are voting why would um the delayed ones suddenly
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:28.320]  be voting for someone different you know um and there's some also very interesting difficult to
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:34.000]  explain anomalies that are affecting a number of different races and different ballot issues
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:40.240]  that kind of point to an algorithm in the voting machines or in the results reporting stuff where
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:47.920]  basically an impossible pattern is appearing as you look at the data uh indicate something that
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:54.160]  could not occur naturally but does seem to be an impossible pattern so kind of hard to explain
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:59.120]  that on the air without looking at the graphs and so forth but very very interesting and getting
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:10.000]  closer to proof wow okay and and and i'll there's also some you know i just uncovered this weekend
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:17.040]  i was trying to figure out now we had heard you know that uh the bane spinoff uh romney
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:23.040]  affiliated uh company bought heart inner civic a voting machine company i had also heard that
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:30.080]  warren buffett had bought the world herald in Omaha which owns e s n s but i found out that they
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:36.320]  had sold e s n s so i thought oh well maybe warren buffett who's an obama supporter doesn't own
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:41.280]  the voting machine company that counted two-thirds of our votes but then it's a little more complicated
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:48.880]  than that um it turns out that the Omaha world herald may have sold the elections division to
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:54.000]  itself in another division so i'm still running that down to see who actually owns these but in
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.920]  the course of that i uncovered a whole bunch of patent applications from election systems and
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:09.360]  software and these things are as creepy as it gets for example they apply for patents for technology
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:16.720]  that allows them to remove cast votes from the electronic poll books so that it would be that
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:23.760]  the person who has is recorded as having voted has not voted that's a patent aren't we lucky
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:31.440]  and another patent even more interesting they call it the poll worker control patent which
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:37.920]  basically allows someone in a central office to gain control of the voting machines unbelievable
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:43.360]  yeah just crazy stuff that's coming out but obviously they develop these tools to be able
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:49.520]  to steal elections they don't want somebody else taking their hard-earned tool uh so and they claim
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:54.640]  that there's a you know a beneficial thing like what if somebody accidentally put the voter in
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.760]  the poll book and they they really didn't vote but yeah but that's fine but look you you can also
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:04.800]  use it for the most evil purposes imaginable and there it fits so yeah they're patenting this stuff
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:11.200]  and it's on the record that's why it's unprecedented how in our face this is but let's go back to what
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:14.880]  the the I mean the big bombshell you dropped days after the election and I went and looked it up on
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:20.080]  your site there was all the links and the online bibliography the proof where they were announcing
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:25.920]  states before they counted any of the votes other than the absentee and early voting and
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:32.080]  you know they announced prop 37 before even a fraction of the votes were counted right they're
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:40.560]  just setting up seven has impossible statistical anomalies now it's one of the ones that I mentioned
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:45.360]  these statistical studies that are really starting to bear fruit one of them is done by a fellow named
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:52.240]  french washoket out of southern california prop 37 looks absolutely impossible from the way that
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:41:00.640]  the numbers are running break down some of the facts on that well uh essentially if you add more
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:06.960]  and more votes into the pool the um the spread sort of evens out because you know like if you're
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:13.440]  if you if you have 10 votes for this guy and five for this guy then there's a certain spread but if
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:20.240]  you have a million for this guy and 500 000 for this guy it takes a lot of votes to make the
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:26.400]  spread change or the percentage of spread change but what was happening in prop 37 is
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:33.440]  the more votes came in and we're talking millions and millions the more the spread changed favoring
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:40.720]  the um uh favoring that they didn't want to know what was in their food it's an impossible situation
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:46.400]  and if you think about it as you add more and more data to the pool that spread is going to
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:52.480]  stabilize but it didn't stabilize at all it kept going the more votes go into the pool the more
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:42:02.320]  this the percentage of spread changed impossible and instead of things getting better in the last
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:07.600]  few decades as the frauds become apparent and even as the public polls show become aware of the fraud
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:14.480]  instead of it being reversed there seems to just be a bum rushing now to shake a tail feather in our
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:21.520]  face hike a leg on us to use you know that crude example and just dominate us and let us know I
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:29.680]  mean next they may announce that you know that the lucky charms uh creature uh the leprechaun
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:35.920]  yeah the leprechaun is is is running things I mean it's well and let me tell you you remember back
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:40.480]  in 2002 they put the health america vote act through which pushed all these electronic voting
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:47.200]  machines into it well the son of help america vote act I call it you know hava's baby is already
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:52.880]  proposed in congress and guess what this one does it offers cash incentives to states that
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:58.320]  basically remove the warm body from the vote in other words uh when you go into the polling
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:04.000]  place to vote you can see you know oh that's alex jones he came into the polling place
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.960]  once you start casting your vote through the internet or through absentee nobody knows there's
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:13.600]  no warm body associated with that voted off so it could be anybody who's putting it well they're
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:18.240]  starting to offer cash in there's a bill in congress to offer cash incentives to state
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:24.400]  to quote unquote streamline their voting system and one of the things that we're receiving incentive
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:29.120]  is to remove the warm body from the vote so that it can't be authenticated who put that vote in
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:36.160]  there unbelievable so just just they know we're waking up so they're accelerating towards open
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:44.080]  complete fraud yes yeah I mean it's it's moving so fast now and on the other hand catching them in
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:50.000]  the act is moving faster and faster as well you know where we're starting to see the minute they
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:55.760]  get out of the gate people start to see it but they're in control what do you do when the criminals
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:03.040]  are in control and are in control of the law enforcement aspect well you just look truth
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:10.080]  doesn't go away and we have to speak keep speaking truth because more and more people in the public
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:15.760]  are starting to understand the problem is that the public can't see what's going on the problem is
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:20.320]  not some kind of cryptography or security or whether you have a paper ballot that's counted
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:27.200]  in secret whether you can't see the whole thing boils down to can the public see it or not and once
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:34.800]  the public gets that then however long it takes the public will never not get that again and when
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:41.040]  you start looking at other situations where there was a power imbalance for example woman suffrage
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:47.280]  men controlled everything you know why would they give it up but as truth continued to come up and
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:51.840]  women started to show the injustices that were being visited on them by legislation that was
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:59.600]  that they had no say in it reached a tipping point and they got the right now that's the kind of thing
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:05.520]  where we have to keep saying that we demand it we absolutely demand it whatever it takes however
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:13.520]  long it takes because there's still more of us than there are of them there certainly are and you
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:19.840]  know take the case of austin the texas where i live the county attorney a few weeks ago came out
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:27.920]  and admitted a close to decade long investigation i'd call that a decade long whitewash that even
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:35.040]  his predecessor had been engaged in of the city of austin having almost all their meetings in secret
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:40.640]  and then lying to the public about it it's totally illegal and he said but i but but if you say you're
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:45.840]  sorry and promise not to do it again we won't prosecute you with all these different crimes
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:51.840]  and it built up to the premeditation it was really a felony but the point is that they're
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:58.720]  still doing it but but there's the example citizens had their civil rights violated by that citizens
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:04.560]  should be suing the members of the city council you know there's more than one way to skin a cat
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:11.120]  if you if the county because you know the city won't do it to itself won't do its job because
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:15.520]  there are a bunch of globalists as well well then you've got to go after them in the court of public
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:21.600]  opinion and even if you don't win the suit at least you file suit and there's a law and anybody
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:27.840]  who lives here is a plaintiff because your electoral system was robbed and a lot of people are business
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:33.360]  owners city council made decisions that were made in secret against you go after them you know it's
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:38.480]  time to get aggressive and bev you've sued these people quite a bit and one time and time again
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:44.720]  the litigation wins and listen even if litigating litigation doesn't prevail think about this in
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:50.560]  the civil rights era they were they had to sometimes take the same issue to court multiple times in
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:56.240]  order to finally win you know it's not we shouldn't just expect it out you know a lawsuit was filed
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:02.560]  and it lost oh well i'll go home no you have to keep pushing and keep pushing and never give up
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:09.440]  and it's going to take as long as it's going to take but the bottom line is truth does eventually
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:15.360]  win in these large imbalances of power that's right we have to find our fighting spirit again
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:20.240]  because there is a spirit over a large part of the public to roll over to anything but
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:26.880]  it's always been that way historically uh there's always a large minority that does not want to be
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:34.000]  a slave and and we're fighting a much smaller minority of criminals right and and slavery is
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:40.560]  a very good analogy because what we're really looking at now it's more subtle but it's basically
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:47.680]  an electronic form of slavery where we are not having a say in the laws that govern us which
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:55.520]  we pay for by our taxes and the say that we should have which controls that has simply been hijacked
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:03.120]  electronically so it's subtle but people do get it and i think as as we change in terms of more
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:08.960]  young people are starting to grow into this they're more familiar with computers and electronics and
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:16.560]  they understand the risks more so than some of the older generation well i know this government
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:25.280]  corruption thieving stealing it's admitted to be at all time record highs uh and uh now we're being
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:31.040]  told you know just give in to it the system knows best and the system can't even control itself
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:35.840]  there are so many different criminal groups involved they will bring the whole system down
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:41.920]  people need to understand that folks uh we are bankrupt the country is being taken over by foreign
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:48.400]  banks we are being economically conquered uh and it is a consortium of organized crime groups
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:53.040]  with high tech public relations firms working for them who are drinking their own kool aid
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:49:02.080]  yeah and and i think uh we have to understand that this is something that i mean i lost my
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:07.040]  train of thought i never do that on your show but i did yes it's great you are so profound there
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:12.480]  i was thinking wow i'm not profound you're profound what are other key points you were
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:16.960]  making a point about you know the awakening is happening that the polls show that your work
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:22.080]  the last 15 years or so we've seen from you've seen the polls 10 they can there's fraud over 90
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:30.000]  percent oh yeah i know what it is you know it's you have to get public awareness and even if all
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:36.640]  you achieve is talking about it so one more person gets it that's how we get where we need to get
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:42.800]  you know that's how major change happens it's not because necessarily some magic
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:48.400]  lawsuit or some one single great investigator because there's an up swelling of understanding
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:53.280]  in the public so we have to keep talking about this stuff and keep finding ways to frame it so
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:50:00.000]  the public understands what's happening to them i agree with you in closing any other key points
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:05.840]  that people should visit black box voting dot org to discover well i gotta tell you it is still
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:13.520]  just pouring in i'm surprised at the velocity of uh this the aftermath this time it's more
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:19.680]  so than i've ever seen really and i think that there's over the next uh month two months 12
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:26.160]  months there's going to be a lot of developments that are really pretty earth shaking well please

[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:16.800]  the liberal media has been suppressing what has fast become in the most shocking news story of 2012
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:22.880]  obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400

[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:40.000]  exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:46.800]  electricity monopoly the video at exposed123.com has already been banned by google and the liberal
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:51.840]  media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep america in the dark so watch it
[01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:58.320]  now at exposed123.com before it's too late again that's exposed123.com
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:06.320]  that's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:11.600]  is home don't let your home be the next target make it look like someone is home watching television
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:17.440]  with fake tv fake tv is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television so
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:22.880]  from outside it looks like someone is home watching tv fake tv plugs in just like a lamp on a timer
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:28.560]  but is far more convincing to burglars fake tv deters burglars costs far less than an alarm and

[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:18.480]  one of the big reasons we're in so much trouble is the private banking cartel that's been based
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:24.640]  in this nation in europe for a long time in 1947 under the name of fighting the soviet threat
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:28.800]  that they'd actually helped put into power on record congressional hearings came out decades
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:34.480]  later on that they were able to get the national security act and just operate in total secrecy
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:42.080]  with just a tiny bit of congressional oversight and with unlimited funds so of course it was
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:47.440]  started by very wicked predators and it just got worse and worse from there on out now more than
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:56.400]  80% of activities by 15 agencies is conducted by private contractors that are given 007 license
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:01.840]  to kill power inside the u.s. they're just murdering killing whoever they want they're
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:07.680]  involved in every type of crime you can imagine my murdering army inspectors that expose fraud
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:14.000]  the list just goes on and on and that's when you get societal breakdown because the system can't
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:21.280]  even prosecute its own forces just to try to have good management i mean the globalists are evil
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:26.480]  but their own management structure will break down because they can't even prosecute their own
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:35.040]  people because that would then expose the corrupt system and in the process it's just going to get
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:39.440]  worse and worse and that's how you have election fraud i mean you've had it with die bold you've
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:43.520]  had with these other big companies their own people have gone public and then mysteriously
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:48.960]  died their engineers have testified to congress and legislatures and the media doesn't cover it
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:56.000]  because that same dominant media cnn msnbc particularly get government taxpayer money
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:02.480]  you know i talked about this in the first hour how it's even in the back of newspapers that oh
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:09.200]  yeah hundreds of billions of dollars over the last decade and and and now it's approaching that every
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:18.160]  year is spent putting messages in media uh and and so that's why you see anti gun anti family
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:24.000]  messages when you see these anti founding father anti liberty messages pro police state messages
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  you wonder why every cop show the cops go i'm violating the bill of rights and they're like good
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.480]  job high five and then it's the right thing to do it you ever wonder why you see that in every cop
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:40.400]  show because it's paid for it's total creepville so cops sit there at home you know beat cops and go
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:44.960]  someday i'll be a detective and get to violate the bill of rights and constitution and it's every
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:51.360]  movie i see about cops because that's the message you're being conditioned you're being prepared
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:56.960]  now i know that we've got ryan and a lot of other people that are
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:05.760]  uh patiently uh holding there and will jam you in before the next dollar ends but we've got folks

[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:55.360]  prison camp and a reeducation camp and i think it's a pretty good movie well you gotta be accurate
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:58.320]  i mean that's what sports stadiums are for that's why they get taxpayer funded

[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:51.840]  today so we can open the phones up later with our guest here uh in one case the gentlemen's
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:56.640]  traveled all the way here from the netherlands to be in studio with us and the other fellow
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:02.880]  from new york city i've gotten over the years to get to know kathryn albric being on jesse ventura
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:07.840]  show with her and you know interviewing her i don't know going back 13 14 years ago when
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:12.960]  she was first starting to fight for consumer privacy and since then she's become one of the
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:18.080]  leading experts on it writing bestselling books and it says she's now i got in a doctorate at
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:24.400]  harvard helping expose what's happening but start page dot com and yes i use start page
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:29.840]  because it does allow you to surf without the nsa that runs google tracking everything
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:35.280]  that you're doing and this is not an infomercial today i mean they do sponsor us a little bit in
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:40.240]  the magazine and on the side some but they're here because they were coming to the united states and
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:47.600]  we're going to be able to come and so they're here in studio with us to cover a host of issues and
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:53.200]  then again later we'll put some headphones on them and take some of your questions and comments
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:10:00.960]  from the audience out there but what a better time of the i couldn't think of one to get into
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:08.720]  the nsa refusing to release secret obama directive on cyber security order allows military takeover
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:15.040]  of the internet and the un couldn't help but brag last week this was in the associated press and also
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:22.800]  it was reported on uh the new america did a great report on it that the un's bragging oh under the
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:30.080]  new system they'll have the dns numbers and they'll have control of the website registration
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:34.080]  basically and again i'm no tech guy but i have a lot of great tech people and i read what the
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:40.240]  experts are saying even seen at news that is cbs division and dekla mccullough and others have
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:45.760]  reported the cyber security act the public one is russian or chinese style net censorship remember
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:50.560]  two years ago in australia the headlines there were chinese style net censorship where they
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:56.560]  just shut you down if they want to so this is the world we're going into internet ids the list
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:03.600]  goes on and on and i wanted to show tv viewers if they're out there uh watching us uh some of these
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:10.160]  articles that i've gotten together uh here just to show you some of the things that are happening
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:19.600]  court rules that google nsa spy ties can remain secret again uh that is a story out of usa today
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:23.280]  well i've been telling you for a decade when google was set up 13 years ago it's come out
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:28.720]  for my ci sources it is the nsa it's not ties they're at military bases that's why they're
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:33.920]  out to do stuff nobody else can do google lied about stealing passwords emails but didn't break
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:39.440]  the law the media claims again continuing here google engineers knew for two years that the
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:44.720]  company's street view cars were stealing emails and passwords via wi-fi just came out months ago
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:49.360]  they've been breaking into people's computers uh despite their privacy settings i mean this is a
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:55.760]  very wicked group here's another one google privacy settlement with ftc wins court approval
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:12:01.840]  and it just goes on and on google government surveillance reports there's privacy free speech
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:10.000]  worries campaigns use of support data supporters data worries privacy advocates and again if you
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:15.280]  go to a bill berg group conference and cover it it's all google and nsa people at them because
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:20.080]  they talk about over the horizon being able to predict the future tracking people in real time
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:23.920]  knowing what you're buying what you're selling what your medical issues are because when you
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:30.160]  ask the oracle of google it's not just giving you information it's finding out what you're doing
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:33.840]  it's like when gandalf's talking to saruman he walks in he goes you can't use one of these
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:40.080]  crystals we don't know who else is looking and he throws the you know the black uh uh silk up
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:44.160]  back over it and soran sitting there looking well that's what's happening that's who's looking back
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:52.800]  out of you uh through your computer so that's just uh some of the news here but we now have
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:57.040]  all of this happening while government at the same time tries to restrict our free speech we
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:01.440]  also have kathryn albricht who's going to be with us again i was just mentioning that for this hour
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:06.000]  and if she can do it she may have to leave us a little bit a a little bit into the next hour
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:12.320]  and again robert beans is the ceo of privacy visionary for nearly a decade the ceo of start
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:18.080]  page dot com robert beans has had a dream how to return freedom privacy and security of the internet
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:23.280]  this dream has turned x quick and start page in the world's most private search engine and now
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:28.000]  the biggest private search engine and robert continues to blaze new trails uh to make using
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:33.600]  the internet even more secure robert holds a masters in dutch law with an emphasis on corporate
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:38.720]  and social studies uh privacy is a fundamental right in the basis of free society we believe
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:43.520]  you should be able to enjoy the internet without giving up that right and that's a statement by
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:48.960]  robert beans ceo of start page dot com and david bodick is the founder security and a
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:55.520]  technical expert and david is a seasoned software architect and extensive privacy and
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:14:02.640]  security expertise um excuse me yeah bodnik thank you and continuing here we got kathryn
[02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:08.560]  albricht who already introduced guys it's great to have you uh here with us uh in studio today
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:13.520]  i don't know where to begin but whoever wants to jump in first can do it then we'll bring kathryn in
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:19.200]  uh but uh what is your take just on them going from denying their spying when you guys started
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:24.160]  out exposing this a decade ago or more to now it's just in your face the head of google schmidt
[02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:28.000]  says yeah we're watching you you shouldn't do something if you don't want us watching you
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.960]  well i mean how about we go look at what's hit you know in his house uh what would you say about
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:38.720]  the state of where we are today sure well first of all thanks a lot for inviting us alex it's a
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:46.960]  great pleasure to be on your show um start page dot com is a privacy search engine means that it's a
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:53.920]  general search engine like google yahoo or bing but with one big difference we focus on safeguarding
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:15:00.400]  the privacy of our users allow me to go into a little bit of a history of how that became the
[02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:07.600]  situation uh we have been in existence since 1998 founded in 1998 and a couple years later we
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:14.560]  did a legal audit into the risks of uh the liabilities of the company and one of the
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:21.200]  elements of that audit was we looked at what we were storing what elements what personal details
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:27.840]  were restoring because there's a liability in europe uh privacy is is is very important and
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:33.520]  i wanted to have an overview we found out that we were storing uh the searches the actual search
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:40.400]  queries the ip addresses we were storing the time and date that people were doing searches the searches
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:47.360]  they clicked on uh basically we were building a database of uh users personal information
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:52.080]  and we didn't use it at all uh it was just done because technically it was possible
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:16:02.480]  finding out that we did that really set off a shock because we had no knowledge of course
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:07.200]  the technical people had the knowledge but they didn't use it and so basically you had to invent
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:11.200]  a whole system just to be able to not spy on people correct correct because the standard
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:15.040]  is that it's all available and it's all being stored because it's free and it's it's cheap to
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:20.080]  to to to store that stuff and that's the real value for people that want to snoop absolutely
[02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:26.880]  uh but but that really changed our whole thinking and then we said it was a shock to us and we said
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:32.960]  well this is not the way we want to do it we're we're uh endangering people's privacy you can't
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:39.120]  do that you cut the red get rid of the the data so we took a 180 degrees term that we've taken
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:48.160]  from the heart and uh we went into the nitty gritty details of uh making sure that we we we
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:53.680]  really safeguard people's privacy we don't keep anything we don't track we keep no data no personal
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:59.520]  data at all and what's also very important is that you don't leak because you can yourself not
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:05.920]  build a database but if you leak it to some other parties that do uh that that's just as bad
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:12.720]  so the the devil is in the details with privacy and we went the whole long way we also got certified
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:19.680]  by an independent third party uh in the in uh in germany which is a uh organization that's
[02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:27.760]  sponsored by the european union and that gives us the also uh trust uh first we got search done
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:31.840]  because it's extremely important people in the street can just search without being tracked
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:39.360]  you can get to the information and once we got that done right we went to the next item we thought
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:44.800]  was really important which is proxy so now you can't just search for information but you can
[02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:50.640]  also go to search results and under each search result you'll see the word proxy and by clicking
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:55.840]  on the proxy you can now load the information and we will load the information off the website you
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:18:02.320]  were uh trying to proxy into our systems and they will only see us and then we show you that
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:06.800]  information but without you being tracked and traced and then you flush it now i know you're
[02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:11.680]  based in europe what are you guys going to do about the fact that under the cyber security
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:15.920]  they couldn't get passed but now obama is just doing by executive order and then telling congress
[02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:21.600]  that secret they want to make the big it companies save all the data so now it's not just that they
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:25.200]  were stealing it now they're going to say oh government because you know google helped write
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:32.560]  it they brag make us save it make it legal by ordering us to do it i think that that is a huge
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:37.760]  us problem the good thing about it is we're in the netherlands no i agree yeah in fact we're
[02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:42.800]  moving our servers we already have to europe mainly for instance is not applicable in in the
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:47.920]  netherlands we we don't fall under the paycheck act so that that's a great thing for start page
[02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:54.240]  those calm users and by the way we've already moved half our servers to uh safe havens in europe as
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:58.400]  well okay we just have to do it because we have a criminal group that's taken over here
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:04.960]  uh anyways i'm ranting keep going ha ha no maybe kathryn wants to comment a little bit
[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:08.880]  further yeah we're about to go to break and when we come back we'll go to kathryn all break
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:13.680]  and just great haven't you guys in the 30 seconds we have i'm honored to get you here thanks for

[02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:44.480]  who's there with us we're just messing with some technical stuff on our end um and we are joined
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:51.040]  here by david bodnik and robert beans robert beans the ceo in studio of start page dot com
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:56.160]  david bodnik is uh the founder and i guess creator of the technology david we haven't talked to you
[02:24:56.160 --> 02:24:59.840]  yet there's some points you guys are saying that's very important for people to understand
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:04.960]  technically uh take it away i mean things you think the public needs to understand and know
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:09.600]  there was a point you were trying to explain to me during the break right it's uh all about the
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:18.080]  filter bubble a phenomena first uh described by ilay periser in a video in a book uh the quest
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:24.880]  for relevance on the internet it's it's going after things you like and then doing the personalization
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:30.880]  that that's what it's all about uh that personalization uh is of course because it's the money the
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:37.840]  money is in there and it's also because uh the geeks who have been developing all this they
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:43.840]  want efficiency so they go for relevance but by trying to get to relevance they'll personalize
[02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:48.800]  everything and they're trying to make everything personalized how do they do that that the only
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:55.600]  way is by tracking you by building huge databases and that's the cover claiming they're profiling you
[02:25:55.600 --> 02:26:01.600]  so they can customize things for you but really for studies show they're using the data to customize
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:06.240]  you they find out how to hit your buttons and convince you that you're actually making these
[02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:10.880]  decisions when really they have a detailed psychological algorithm to be used and deployed
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:17.440]  against you right and and and they're making more money of it there's a phenomena that that that is
[02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:24.400]  the result um because they're they're they're filtering effectively filtering the the results
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:30.800]  you're seeing online and what you see online slowly taking away chips of what you use to see
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:36.800]  and putting you in a bubble effectively so you get to see less of what you didn't like and more
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:41.360]  of what you liked and more of what you already clicked on so it allows people to segregate
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:46.320]  themselves in their own little niches right yeah go ahead right and and for instance if you do a
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:51.120]  search for egypt i do a search for egypt they'll show you different search result than i then
[02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:55.680]  they'll show me and that's a phenomenon not many people know we know we've been been tracked and
[02:26:55.680 --> 02:27:02.480]  followed by ads all over the place because we we search for for for for stuff but we don't know
[02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:08.800]  that also the the normal results are being filtered out so it's creating micro realities
[02:27:08.800 --> 02:27:17.360]  and feedback loops for what are already cloistered uh false reality was correct absolutely correct
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:22.000]  so you're getting less and less objective information and news which is an extremely
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:29.760]  uh scary situation um it's contrary to the original dreams of the internet it's dangerous
[02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:37.040]  it also sets up uh it borders censorship uh but it definitely sets up for manipulation and by the
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:42.000]  way that's not your opinion they've had all the real inventors of the internet uh more than
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:47.360]  several dozen of them come out and go public and say the web is now authoritarian i mean we can
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:52.160]  pull some of those articles up inventor of web says web now authoritarian you know we're in trouble
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:58.480]  look out i mean this is not your opinion it's not my original opinion i got to admit no but i mean
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:03.360]  i meant that like people are backing you up absolutely and and and actually you guys are
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:07.280]  trailblazers how long ago does you guys start getting there i mean you started talking about
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:12.640]  the embryonic beginnings of this but you know how did you end up uh uh meeting david david how did
[02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:19.200]  you get involved because you guys were way ahead of the curve on this right or originally uh start
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:27.200]  page and x quick uh were not privacy uh search engines and and there was a a real turn uh
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:32.960]  about six years ago where that became the um the entire focus of the company when the
[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:39.920]  lawyers were trying to make it actually fall the law right yeah yeah wow i mean that's awesome
[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:47.360]  yeah and and um we we've actually uh there there's actually a lot of little details that go
[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:53.680]  into trying to to avoid the tracking and trying to prevent us from even
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:29:01.200]  of being able to know anything about um what is what's being searched for we we don't store log
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:07.760]  files we we don't have log files so if somebody comes and says we want to see um all information
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:13.360]  about searches about this this and this we don't have it and see that's indentured servitude if
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:18.800]  they pass the cyber security act which obama couldn't get passed it says i've got to save everything
[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:23.760]  i don't want to save people's ip addresses i don't want uh number one i don't want to pay for all
[02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:30.080]  that data and i don't want the liability of having to save it i mean we want to delete it right when
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:36.640]  it comes in and even if you trust somebody who's saving all sorts of data uh on you right now
[02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:41.280]  who's to say that they're going to be the they're going to be the only people with access to that
[02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:46.160]  now and in the future exactly it allows the breach stay there riveting stuff folks we're going deep

[02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:28.400]  and i've seen some of the numbers am i right in saying you guys are now the biggest in the business
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:32.160]  i mean there's a couple other i guess competitors but they don't even seem to show up on the radar
[02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:38.640]  screen yeah that's definitely true and we um we were talking before about some of the technical
[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:46.640]  details that are really necessary to think through and focus on to to deliver private search one
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:54.800]  one other area is encryption so that because if you're searching through http usually even if
[02:35:54.800 --> 02:36:00.480]  you think that you're only talking with the search engine that you're talking with all of that
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:08.640]  information can be recorded by your isp and by other parties along the way and um it it could
[02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:17.760]  fall into the wrong hands and so what we do with start page is that we use https by default so that
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:24.000]  all of the um all of the search requests are encrypted uh it just can't be read by anybody
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:30.560]  else it's directly between your computer and our computer and nobody in between can can listen in
[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:36.720]  and another thing that we do for example is that if you click on a result we arrange it so that the
[02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:42.880]  site you're going to doesn't see what you've searched for because usually if you do a search
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:48.080]  then you click on a result the site you've seen sees exactly what search term you have been looking
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:53.520]  for so we make it so they can't see anything that you've searched for well that's the answer is for
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:57.520]  people to take this in their own hands and i know it's it's been extremely popular so
[02:36:58.240 --> 02:37:03.920]  that's the best thing do the right thing and become successful amazing there's so many other
[02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:08.320]  points we're going to go over and i've got a laundry list of questions that i want to discuss
[02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:13.600]  here as well today with our guests but let's bring up now we're going to go into overdrive into the
[02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:18.560]  next hour as well and open the phones up at that time Dr. Dr. Catherine Albrecht privacy expert
[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:24.480]  and spokesperson for starpage.com Catherine is a respected privacy expert researcher and activist
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:30.240]  and the US spokesperson for start page xquik and start mail Catherine regularly reports on
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:35.760]  breaking news in the privacy arena and she's a huge fan of info wars i didn't i hadn't even read this
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:40.720]  yet that here's my start page from their bio site and it says info wars Catherine holds a doctorate
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:45.760]  in consumer education from harvard university privacy is more than just our business it's our
[02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:51.360]  passion Catherine Albrecht and she's also recently praised god uh her cancer i think it's in in
[02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:57.440]  remission uh last time i heard her breast cancer and so she joins us via video skype and uh Catherine
[02:37:57.440 --> 02:38:03.040]  always great having you on with us and i'm flattered that these guys came to visit me uh well all
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:08.400]  the way from new york uh and the netherlands well hey alex it's so good to be on your show and i
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:13.520]  gotta tell you i really love working with robert and david and the whole team there at start page
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:18.560]  it's it's really uh wonderful to me people who care this much about privacy but have the ability
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:24.000]  to actually put it into action and so i'm delighted that they're there in the studio i'm so glad that
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:28.880]  they're getting to know the info wars audience and and vice versa and i just think it's uh it's a
[02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:34.080]  wonderful thing that they're there in austin well it's exciting having you here with us i mean i know
[02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:37.280]  you've been chomping up to bit the last 20 minutes sitting there on the hall while we were fixing a
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:42.240]  technical issue uh things you'd like to add to what they've said and and other things people should
[02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:47.280]  know and understand because here i am assaulting google and obviously you know we all end up using
[02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:51.760]  google one way or another their goal is to become the web but now it's even worse than i thought
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:57.760]  10 years ago where they're just an nsa front spying on everything hacking your computers
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:02.480]  and not getting in trouble just amazing well and you know you've experienced some of this too alex
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:08.160]  i know uh youtube is is now totally owned and controlled by google the other thing people
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:13.920]  need to be aware of is is it's not just the searches but it's also people's email through gmail
[02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:18.320]  so one of the reasons why i why i think it's so exciting what's being done over there at
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:23.440]  its start page and i'm of course part of the company now is that they're working on private
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:27.520]  email as well and so when you look at the big picture and i think this has really been uh
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:33.120]  robert's vision for the company is really saying where where are the choke points for privacy where
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:37.040]  is it that there are things that we all need that we all want access to whether it's you know quick
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:41.360]  answers to our questions through search whether it's the ability to log on through any kind of a
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:45.920]  device and know that you're encrypted and you're not being observed uh the proxy so you can actually
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:50.400]  go to other websites even maybe questionable websites that might be spying on you or putting
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:54.720]  tracking cookies on your browser you can go there with the proxy and then of course nowadays
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:40:00.400]  with all the big story about patria's and their gmail accounts being looked at you know if you
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:13.440]  say the head of the cia director is being spot on i'm sorry go ahead isn't it crazy you got the head of the cia who can't even keep his own email private so clearly if patria's can't do it then the average person out there can't do it either
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:21.280]  and that's the big exciting frontier now for start pages coming out with start mail which will be the world's most private emails so i think
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:27.520]  you know we're we're always looking at where are those points where people's privacy is invaded and what are the needs what are people doing on a
[02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:34.000]  day-to-day basis so we've got a new app coming out for mobile devices all of the ways that that the internet is a moving target
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:39.600]  and the other thing that you you mentioned earlier in the interview that i think is so important is all of this new
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:45.920]  cybersecurity law that's being contemplated there's a vote coming up this week as i'm sure you and your
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:53.040]  listeners have been discussing that could potentially give the government access to your email without a warrant
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:58.880]  so when you when you look at that you say wow we in the u.s. are really under attack we are under attack by our own
[02:40:58.880 --> 02:41:02.480]  government we're under attack by the big marketers and the corporations
[02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:07.280]  and what i love about start page and what i will love about start mail when it's available
[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:12.720]  is being based over in europe let's say that there was a patriot act request or a subpoena or a warrant
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:19.520]  there would be really no way that a u.s. court would be able to access any information off of start page or start mail
[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:23.280]  for a couple of reasons number one is they don't have jurisdiction they would have to actually go to a
[02:41:23.280 --> 02:41:28.800]  dutch court and get dutch permission which is virtually impossible and even if they did
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:31.840]  once they access the servers there would be literally nothing on them
[02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:36.080]  so no record made of anyone's ip address no record made of what you search for in fact
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:39.760]  start page wouldn't even be able to say definitively either way whether you'd ever
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:43.920]  access their website at all so that that's the part that i think is so awesome
[02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:50.320]  and i've got it up on screen it's a scenic story from yahoo senate bill rewrite let's feds read
[02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:55.680]  your email without warrants remember bush just six years ago he'd say i promise we're not reading
[02:41:55.680 --> 02:42:01.200]  your email and we would never do that's illegal only alcada and then now it's just yeah everything
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:06.080]  you do we're watching and get used to it what do you think kathryn the change in attitude is really
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:11.360]  all about i think it's because people haven't pushed back i i think that's really what it is
[02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:15.600]  back when nine eleven happened and you were on top of things long before then i was listening
[02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:19.840]  to your show back in the nineties literally so i know you knew about this but a lot of people
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:23.760]  didn't you know they didn't believe when when you were up there at the microphone saying hey listen
[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:28.240]  they've already got legislation written they're just waiting for the perfect excuse to implement it
[02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:33.360]  and then along comes nine nine eleven and boom all of a sudden they have this patriot act pre-written
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:38.080]  all you know how many reams of paper that thing took they just pulled it out of a drawer ready
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:43.120]  made and went oh here's the solution so i think what it is is people have gotten used to the
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:48.240]  security state we're used to being naked eyes to the airport we're getting used to being tracked on
[02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:53.280]  our jobs i think people are getting used to are trying to get kids used to being tracked in schools
[02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:57.520]  and i really think that they're saying now's the time to push the envelope i don't buy it though i
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:43:01.600]  really do believe especially seeing that the growth of start page which is now the biggest
[02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:05.760]  privacy service on the entire internet you know there's a huge clamor for this people don't want
[02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:10.560]  to be spied on exactly and take the Hernandez take the Hernandez family in san Antonio that
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:15.280]  you've helped so much and that we've covered here at info wars and we were first covering that no
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:21.600]  media attention broke a huge coverage and then they expel the little girl for not wearing a
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:26.480]  tracker chip that followed her on the bus and when she went home and then it becomes a national
[02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:31.360]  story and then the then the court strikes down the school now there are other kids revolting in
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:36.640]  mass and then it turns out this all happened before in 1999 Louisiana where they kicked one
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:41.680]  little girl out again a little girl who wouldn't wear just a barcode and then the whole school
[02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:47.120]  revolted it's the same story you're always alone up front but you've got to do the right thing
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:52.560]  and know this even if you don't win in your own personal fight the fighting spirit is what will
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:57.200]  win uh you guys want to comment uh robert david on the points that katherine just made not just made
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:07.680]  i think katherine is absolutely right just wanted to comment on on databases because databases are
[02:44:07.680 --> 02:44:16.480]  so huge um you have large databases maintained by amazon by google by facebook immense piles
[02:44:16.480 --> 02:44:23.520]  of personal data but there's also commercial databases and i learned about a company called
[02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:29.680]  axiom actually it's in in conway in arkansas that maintains a massive database apparently the
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:36.880]  most massive database commercially speaking in the u.s it's believed they track 1500 personal
[02:44:36.880 --> 02:44:44.880]  data points and they have 97 of the u.s citizens in that database database just after 911 to give
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:50.800]  an example of how powerful they are the government agencies were trying to come up with information
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:45:00.640]  about the uh hijackers and they turned to that company axiom for help uh they found out that
[02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:10.160]  axiom knew more than the combined uh government agencies on 11 of the 19 hijackers an unbelievable
[02:45:10.160 --> 02:45:16.320]  story talk about scary well also i'm sure you guys have read about this because here i am using the
[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:21.680]  nsa search engine right now and i do use starpage at home my wife uses it but i'm publicly using
[02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:26.640]  google just because i know still the general public has become habituated totally addicted to it
[02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:33.920]  to show people uh but but here is google invest in app that predicts the future but that's only
[02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:39.360]  one story for many years they've been able to predict mass movements with over 90 accuracy
[02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:44.720]  that's what they're telling us and they now admit it's well well i mean here it is right out of
[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:49.760]  a wired magazine that they want to be able to tell the future it says apparently google can
[02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:54.480]  predict the future and of course then there's fraud in this they can just say that then people
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:46:02.160]  believe it and then that affects their choices via a bandwidth uh or a bandwagon effect you guys
[02:46:02.160 --> 02:46:09.840]  have any comments on that well you can question yourself why is google able to do that it's simply
[02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:16.240]  because the masses are still using it to a large extent i i flew in yesterday i was in austin waiting
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:22.560]  for my connecting flight you look around and you see at least 50 maybe 60 of people they're using
[02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:27.680]  mobile devices so they're feeding their personal data into those databases they're willing to feed
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:36.640]  those databases without databases without personalize personal details they can't do anything in fact
[02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:42.000]  we'll punch this up here we are on google on the nsa and then you can just click right here and go
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:47.760]  to startpage.com and we do need to get everybody to habituate to using start page because as things
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:52.320]  get worse and worse people've got to move away from google i mean when you first came on i read
[02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:56.960]  that laundry list it's more than that and i want to get catherine's take on this but also want to
[02:46:56.960 --> 02:47:02.080]  get david bodnick's take on this because you're a software you know engineer expert on this i've
[02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:06.640]  studied it though and i remember being told by david steel and others that google wasn't started
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:11.440]  by the cia they are the cia and that's why they're allowed to do stuff with copyright nobody else
[02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:17.360]  can do that's why they're able to you know not get in trouble for years driving around with
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:21.760]  mobile trucks cracking your code breaking into your computer i mean if i did that would be 10 years
[02:47:21.760 --> 02:47:27.520]  in jail uh so who is google from your research gentlemen and i want to get catherine's take on that
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:34.640]  well and i just want to add that it's not just google you know it it's google's the easy and
[02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:38.320]  obvious target because it's the default on everybody's search engine you you open up your
[02:47:38.320 --> 02:47:43.040]  brand new device and there's google right there they pay for that placement but there's also yahu
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:47.120]  and bing and they're all doing it and in fact uh one of the big developments just in the last
[02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:51.520]  couple of months and i know your listeners are aware of this is that microsoft just did the same
[02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:56.560]  kind of oneness policy with its hotmail accounts that google did a couple of months back with its
[02:47:56.560 --> 02:48:01.840]  gmail accounts and that's to say any email that you write or receive to or from a hotmail account
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:06.640]  now is going to be grabbed by microsoft and it's worse than that to have a youtube account
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:11.440]  you basically have to have the google mail now and to use their other platforms you have to have it
[02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:17.360]  and then they're tracking confirming your identity that's the beginning of the global web id where
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:22.880]  they can then turn off your web access so i think the bigger question is is even less how
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:28.400]  do they get started but what are they right now and what google and yahu and bing all the search
[02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:33.920]  engines have become is is really a honeypot sort of a lure to get people to log on multiple times
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:38.000]  a day and say here's what i'm thinking here's what i'm cooking for dinner here's my doctor's name
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:42.000]  here's the medical condition i'm concerned about here are my financial data because we all type it
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:48.080]  in bankruptcy information or looking for a new job or um you know the rather than make a reservation
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:51.440]  to a restaurant we just type the name of the restaurant in and expect the search engine to
[02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:56.480]  give us the information back and what people need to realize is that those search engines are not in
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:49:00.880]  the business of altruistically giving you answers for free they're not big brother government big
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:06.880]  sister helping you they're they're corporations and if the government doesn't love me and google
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:12.640]  doesn't i'm they love your information i'll tell you that and and the problem is once this stuff
[02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:17.440]  gets collected regardless of who collects it it's going to be a target and we know that because the
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:22.880]  chinese government we believe hacked into gmail accounts and into google systems so that they
[02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:28.800]  could target and identify people who were activists against them oh yeah they're being given access
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:35.840]  that's the cover that they hacked in and at the same time again these back doors are not just in
[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:40.960]  the software or just in the sites they've been hardwired into the devices themselves i mean this
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:47.280]  is a premeditated technocratic takeover david comments on what you're hearing here you know

[02:56:07.600 --> 02:56:13.680]  hour live into overdrive here the fourth hour but uh during the break uh robert you were making
[02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:19.760]  points uh about hey yes we know this is going on the answer is get away with it vote with your
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:25.120]  actions so please continue and then and then i want you to continue david oh that that's exactly
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:31.280]  what i was saying alex it's extremely important people vote with their actions because um of
[02:56:31.280 --> 02:56:36.640]  course they need to be informed first ignorance is our biggest enemy if people don't know what's
[02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:43.280]  going on uh they have no way to respond to it you are extremely well at informing them letting them
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:49.760]  know what's what's out there what's what's going after them uh it's our duty we see it as our mission
[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:56.160]  to come up with products first search then the proxy and uh next year uh we'll add private and
[02:56:56.160 --> 02:57:02.960]  secure email to that to give back those tools to the general public to make them get off the
[02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:09.840]  the grid where they're being traced and tracked and i think that's extremely important that uh
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:14.400]  people are informed and the alternatives are there and we'll continue to build them david you got
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:18.880]  interrupted by the break you were making the point about and you never got to finish all
[02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:24.080]  these thousands of searches everything you're doing the choices you make on those sites uh
[02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:30.400]  i mean what is this doing it's really incredible the volume of information that is collected
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:36.240]  from you in one piece of information doesn't matter two pieces don't matter but the profiles that
[02:57:36.240 --> 02:57:44.880]  are built up on you over a dozen years from every place you look on the internet is it's really
[02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:53.280]  unbelievably detailed and sometime back america online had made a big a cataclysmic
[02:57:53.280 --> 02:57:59.520]  uh error in judgment and they they released information just about the the searches they were
[02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:06.080]  tracking uh two researchers and um of course this got out to everybody and they tried to
[02:58:06.080 --> 02:58:12.720]  make this anonymous by giving everybody a number instead of saying this is this is who you are
[02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:18.800]  and people were able to look at that and figure out who was searched who a lot of those individuals
[02:58:18.800 --> 02:58:23.760]  were just by looking at the the combined searches they had well i want to get katherine albert's
[02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:27.520]  take on that and more of your tech when we come back and then phone calls but i mean here's an
[02:58:27.520 --> 02:58:32.800]  example your wife has a miscarriage she goes to look up the information your parents your family
[02:58:32.800 --> 02:58:37.840]  don't know but the government and thousands of corporations that buy that data they all know
[02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:43.520]  about your personal life or if you have a disease whatever the case is what religion you are what

[03:08:49.440 --> 03:08:54.640]  dr catrin ombrick start page dot com and yes what we're trying to get you to do
[03:08:55.600 --> 03:09:00.960]  is to become aware of what's happening and yes they're a small sponsor over the years
[03:09:00.960 --> 03:09:06.000]  but all sponsors are important now they sponsor info wars magazine and they also sponsor some
[03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:12.320]  on the site but um i've got them here you know this is not a sponsored interview today um you know
[03:09:12.320 --> 03:09:15.440]  to really promote this because i was talking to him i guess about a month ago on the phone
[03:09:16.160 --> 03:09:20.000]  i was talking to robert and i think you were on the line too right david and i was like you
[03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:25.280]  know what next time you're in the us come on down to austin and they called a few weeks later and
[03:09:25.280 --> 03:09:30.880]  said all right we're coming uh and so here they are i'm flattered uh and it's very very exciting
[03:09:30.880 --> 03:09:35.840]  i'm going to treat you guys with some texas barbecue after the show uh but to make a long story short i
[03:09:35.840 --> 03:09:43.680]  mean it's good to have something that we can do instead of just laying down to this and you guys
[03:09:43.680 --> 03:09:48.560]  have been around for a long time you're expanding and your search just gets better and better and
[03:09:48.560 --> 03:09:53.120]  better in fact i like a lot of the results i get from you guys even better than what i get with a
[03:09:53.120 --> 03:09:57.920]  standard google search i want to go to dr catrin ombrick before we go to uh callers because in
[03:09:57.920 --> 03:10:02.240]  between my big mouth and then all three of us there's not a lot of time for each person but
[03:10:03.120 --> 03:10:08.720]  if you just joined us david uh just brought up uh during the break hey look at how the police pull
[03:10:08.720 --> 03:10:12.800]  you over now and grab your cell phone and say it's not your private data and download the
[03:10:12.800 --> 03:10:17.600]  content so that a warrant you're i mean the first amendment is important but what about what about
[03:10:17.600 --> 03:10:22.960]  the fourth you should be secure in your person papers and effects and that your home should be
[03:10:22.960 --> 03:10:29.120]  secure in fact let's pull up the fourth amendment on screen perhaps uh but but if you go to start page
[03:10:29.120 --> 03:10:36.160]  dot com and simply type in police take cell phone data first news abc news michigan police
[03:10:36.720 --> 03:10:41.920]  use device to download cell phone data without warrants and then we showed the other headline
[03:10:41.920 --> 03:10:47.280]  earlier where senate bill allows reading your email without a warrant see they know that we're
[03:10:47.280 --> 03:10:53.200]  waking up to them and engaging in all these crimes so now they're retroactively trying to get it all
[03:10:53.200 --> 03:10:58.240]  legalized before we go to dr catrin albricht on this uh david anything else you'd like to add
[03:10:58.240 --> 03:11:03.040]  robert things you'd like to add on the points i've been raising you know the one the one other
[03:11:03.040 --> 03:11:08.240]  um the thought is that i think there's a huge difference between uh people saying that they're
[03:11:08.240 --> 03:11:15.760]  going to uh they're going to act respectively and and treat your data privately and um actually
[03:11:15.760 --> 03:11:22.160]  standing behind that and doing it so for example at start page we have audits where we are audited
[03:11:22.160 --> 03:11:28.080]  by third party uh that says yes you are doing exactly what you're saying you're going to do so
[03:11:28.080 --> 03:11:34.800]  that it's not a matter of trust in one person or a one company no matter how good and virtuous they
[03:11:34.800 --> 03:11:40.800]  might seem but there's um something to really stand behind that you mean i can't trust apple
[03:11:40.800 --> 03:11:46.880]  that it medley runs the worst slave factories in china and a suicide net surround them right i mean
[03:11:46.880 --> 03:11:51.680]  alan gore's liberal i mean he's really he said about paying carbon taxes he'll save me from global
[03:11:51.680 --> 03:11:58.240]  warming and and you know it for for people and companies that you trust you might trust them
[03:11:58.240 --> 03:12:05.280]  now and other people might get access to that information or um get involved with those organizations
[03:12:05.280 --> 03:12:14.080]  so um it's just so important to be able to have that uh that uh accountability uh that's not just
[03:12:14.080 --> 03:12:19.680]  an i promise i'm doing this but somebody's saying yes you're you're doing what you said you are
[03:12:19.680 --> 03:12:23.680]  and holding you accountable you're right i'm going to punch up the text of the fourth amendment
[03:12:23.680 --> 03:12:29.120]  i've got it up on my screen right here the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses
[03:12:29.120 --> 03:12:34.880]  papers and effects against unreasonable surges and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants
[03:12:34.880 --> 03:12:40.240]  shall be issued but upon probable cause supported by an oath or affirmation and particularly describing
[03:12:40.240 --> 03:12:45.120]  the place to be searched the person or things to be seized so let me see the right of the people
[03:12:45.120 --> 03:12:50.160]  to be secure in their persons that means you know a notepad you're carrying or a cell phone with
[03:12:50.160 --> 03:12:57.600]  the data on it persons houses papers oh my my cell phone isn't my papers because it's digital papers
[03:12:57.600 --> 03:13:02.160]  and effects so that's not my effects against unreasonable searches and seizures should not
[03:13:02.160 --> 03:13:08.960]  be violated and then they go on to you know to just to define what unreasonable is and no warrants
[03:13:08.960 --> 03:13:13.280]  and you got to have a warrant and you don't just get a rubber stamp no warrant shall be issued but
[03:13:13.280 --> 03:13:17.520]  upon probable cause support about oath or affirmation and particularly describing the
[03:13:17.520 --> 03:13:22.320]  place to be searched and the person or things to be seized i mean what is hard to understand about
[03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:27.920]  that it's pretty clear but if we just wave our rights katherine albert you're recovering a lot
[03:13:27.920 --> 03:13:32.320]  of issues here but there's a whole laundry list of things happening what should be what should we be
[03:13:32.320 --> 03:13:36.880]  aware of right now well you know we're talking about the google search and you were talking about
[03:13:36.880 --> 03:13:41.440]  how you can just look up police grab cell phone and you get the results and i should point out
[03:13:41.440 --> 03:13:46.160]  that what you're getting when you search with star page are actually google results without the google
[03:13:46.160 --> 03:13:50.400]  tracking and i think that's that that that's one of the features that we haven't really gotten into
[03:13:50.400 --> 03:13:56.480]  but when when we set up star page your earlier listeners may recall that we had a and still
[03:13:56.480 --> 03:14:01.840]  have a search engine called x quick and x quick goes out and takes your search and delivers it in
[03:14:01.840 --> 03:14:06.960]  real time to multiple different search engines so x quick will also will oftentimes have a different
[03:14:06.960 --> 03:14:11.040]  set of results than you'll get from star page because what star page does is go directly to
[03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:17.600]  google and what's cool about that is we actually yeah nobody can deny google has a fabulous search
[03:14:17.600 --> 03:14:22.800]  engine you can search the nsa slave grid without sort on looking back through the crystal there you
[03:14:22.800 --> 03:14:28.000]  go exactly right so you get the advantage of all of the thousands of hours of engineering that have
[03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:32.800]  gone into making google a really good search engine but you're able to access them completely
[03:14:32.800 --> 03:14:36.720]  privately because we sort of play the middleman for you so we go out there we say hey google
[03:14:37.360 --> 03:14:42.800]  give us everything you have on egypt and then google comes back and says well who are you
[03:14:42.800 --> 03:14:47.760]  and all they see is oh it's an anonymous star page server i have no idea who that is so i can't
[03:14:47.760 --> 03:14:53.040]  censor the information or put it in a filter bubble or tie it in with your previous searches
[03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:57.600]  to market to you i guess i'm just gonna have to give you the information on egypt what do you know
[03:14:57.600 --> 03:15:01.040]  and so then we turn around and we take that information we strip away all the tracking
[03:15:01.040 --> 03:15:06.400]  cookies all of the invasive invasive technologies that google associates with that and we serve it
[03:15:06.400 --> 03:15:11.200]  to you clean and then on the fly we immediately erase the fact that you were ever even there in
[03:15:11.200 --> 03:15:15.440]  fact we don't we don't just erase it we never record it in the first place so when you land on
[03:15:15.440 --> 03:15:19.760]  our servers instead of us putting down your ip address we put zeros so there's literally no
[03:15:19.760 --> 03:15:24.000]  record of you being there what's even cooler though is that you said that you found this
[03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:29.360]  police grab cell phone data with a start page search and the first link was to abc news well
[03:15:29.360 --> 03:15:33.920]  if you click that whether you get there from star page or google or wherever if you click that link
[03:15:33.920 --> 03:15:38.720]  now abc news is making a direct connection with your browser and with your computer
[03:15:38.720 --> 03:15:43.280]  they're now in a position to read cookies place cookies track you do whatever it is they want to
[03:15:43.280 --> 03:15:48.880]  do and if they're unscrupulous or let's say maybe a government agency with an interest in
[03:15:48.880 --> 03:15:55.920]  knowing even more about you they could potentially even put malware or spyware these computers in
[03:15:55.920 --> 03:16:02.880]  your house are literally like giant new world order eyeballs crystal balls both ways that's
[03:16:02.880 --> 03:16:07.040]  even what they liken it to because it can predict the future of tracking people looking into your
[03:16:07.040 --> 03:16:12.560]  house like i remember telling people 15 years ago 16 years ago that cell phones by federal law
[03:16:12.560 --> 03:16:16.640]  had to be satellite tracked with the local cell towers triangulating them and that they could
[03:16:16.640 --> 03:16:21.840]  dial in and listen to you without a warrant even when the phone was off same thing with on star
[03:16:21.840 --> 03:16:27.360]  now it's all admitted i mean they have engineered everything to do this to us and so you know that
[03:16:27.360 --> 03:16:34.720]  they stop the start me stop the smart meters on your house uh you know disable the geolocating
[03:16:34.720 --> 03:16:40.320]  on the phones uh use start page dot com uh what are some of the other things kathryn this is really
[03:16:40.320 --> 03:16:45.360]  your expertise we can do other than start page to protect ourselves from the eye of sauron well
[03:16:45.360 --> 03:16:49.600]  and what it was going to say is just on the start page issue when you when you get that abc news
[03:16:49.600 --> 03:16:53.680]  result if you trust abc news go ahead and click i mean it probably doesn't matter much but if it's
[03:16:53.680 --> 03:16:57.760]  something really sensitive and you don't even want abc news to know it then you can use the start
[03:16:57.760 --> 03:17:02.960]  page proxy and so it enables you to not only search privately so nobody's watching all of your
[03:17:02.960 --> 03:17:08.160]  searches but it also allows you to privately figure out what is on all the web pages that you
[03:17:08.160 --> 03:17:11.840]  want to visit without anybody seeing you so that and the encryption i think i think it's really
[03:17:11.840 --> 03:17:18.160]  fabulous um other things that that people can do is just be a little bit more aware you know a lot
[03:17:18.160 --> 03:17:23.920]  of apps on just things that you can install on your smartphone a lot of those apps in the fine
[03:17:23.920 --> 03:17:28.080]  print or even not in the fine print some of the eastern european manufacturers of these apps and
[03:17:28.080 --> 03:17:33.520]  software designers are really criminals in disguise and they've built back doors into these apps so if
[03:17:33.520 --> 03:17:38.000]  an app looks a little bit shady or if you don't really need it if you don't trust who it's coming
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:43.840]  from i certainly would not be installing that onto my phone uh we know from facebook that story that
[03:17:43.840 --> 03:17:49.040]  i believe you covered a while back which was about the guy who for five bucks was able to purchase
[03:17:49.040 --> 03:17:53.920]  all of those facebook addresses i think he got thousands and thousands of people's actual
[03:17:53.920 --> 03:17:59.280]  full facebook accounts their email addresses and more and he was able to do that by purchasing this
[03:17:59.280 --> 03:18:05.280]  from some shady eastern european you know block of criminals who had gotten the information by
[03:18:05.280 --> 03:18:09.760]  installing bogus apps on people's computers and so if it looks too good to be true there's a good
[03:18:09.760 --> 03:18:14.240]  chance that it is that's probably a good rule of thumb and as far as start page goes you know the
[03:18:14.240 --> 03:18:19.600]  biggest the hardest part uh alex i think for people to break is this habit of giving billions of
[03:18:19.600 --> 03:18:24.720]  dollars of free advertising to google every single day when we just use this throwaway phrase google
[03:18:24.720 --> 03:18:30.160]  it you know go just go just go online and google this or google that and i have to say it took me
[03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:34.560]  a couple of months to break the habit and i finally did and now i say start page it and when people
[03:18:34.560 --> 03:18:39.040]  go huh then it creates a wonderful opportunity to have that conversation yeah well start page
[03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:43.840]  we'll give you google results without the tracking start page it and i'm trying to say well you know
[03:18:43.840 --> 03:18:49.440]  just use the nsa spy grid google so i do i mean literally it's like at least let them know what
[03:18:49.440 --> 03:18:52.880]  it is absolutely if they're gonna use it they ought to know what it is they're using no kidding
[03:18:53.440 --> 03:18:58.240]  but think about it i mean i like my neighbor or whatever down the street but i'm not gonna want
[03:18:58.240 --> 03:19:03.680]  them looking into my private information when i'm you know they're looking up a medical issue or
[03:19:03.680 --> 03:19:08.960]  something this is ridiculous that we've gotten this far but you know you can contrast that alex is
[03:19:08.960 --> 03:19:13.280]  creepy as it sounds i would almost have rather have my neighbor down the street with with a spy cam
[03:19:13.280 --> 03:19:18.240]  looking through my window because at least that one particular person is going to get old they're
[03:19:18.240 --> 03:19:22.000]  going to die they're going to forget they're going to move that's just one guy it's just one person
[03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:26.640]  this is a record for any government mania that take obama care where all of your medical stuff is
[03:19:26.640 --> 03:19:31.920]  now given to the irs that's right so it's what you need to understand is they collect everything
[03:19:31.920 --> 03:19:36.080]  they're not like a human who gets tired goes to bed takes a nap you know they're collecting
[03:19:36.080 --> 03:19:41.440]  everything all the time katherine albert is our guest we're going to come back with your phone

[03:25:33.120 --> 03:25:40.080]  take your phone calls right now clayton uh calling in from canada you're on the air uh who are you
[03:25:40.080 --> 03:25:48.240]  addressing your question to sir um any any anyone actually just the uh the star page folks so uh i
[03:25:48.240 --> 03:25:54.080]  basically discovered the internet through google and noticed very early on that things didn't really
[03:25:54.080 --> 03:25:59.200]  pop up the way i was searching for them so i'm very happy that you guys have given us like a
[03:25:59.200 --> 03:26:06.560]  an alternative that also gives us the same you know value of service i guess um but basically um
[03:26:07.600 --> 03:26:14.400]  i just want to say on the whole thing of like privacy and uh basically i was actually uh
[03:26:14.400 --> 03:26:20.480]  wrongly arrested at one point for armed robbery and the whole thing did not make any sense to the whole
[03:26:21.280 --> 03:26:27.280]  you know nwo kind of having their hands and everything uh definitely is apparent um basically
[03:26:27.280 --> 03:26:31.760]  they came to my front door they said you know you're under arrest they didn't just say we're
[03:26:31.760 --> 03:26:36.320]  going to take you in for questioning they just you know break off the bat you know you're going in
[03:26:36.320 --> 03:26:42.640]  and pretty much it seemed to me they were just looking for evidence that we couldn't use against
[03:26:42.640 --> 03:26:48.960]  them to keep us safe basically i hear you clayton i appreciate your call i mean i wonder if there's
[03:26:48.960 --> 03:26:54.400]  a question there but i'm glad you like star page dot com thank you uh george in connecticut
[03:26:54.400 --> 03:27:00.560]  you're on the air go ahead yeah i have a question um i i just uh got a new computer with the new
[03:27:00.560 --> 03:27:05.360]  operating system which drives me crazy it looks like they're looking for information 100 different
[03:27:05.360 --> 03:27:10.880]  ways they never did before is one and two is there another way to download something that's
[03:27:10.880 --> 03:27:16.240]  light outlook that's uh that keeps your privacy because i don't want to give microsoft my information
[03:27:16.240 --> 03:27:20.160]  especially my address book and all that great stuff yeah the biggest thing is i wouldn't use
[03:27:20.160 --> 03:27:27.600]  microsoft you should use an open source um what jenu or or linux i mean by doing that you move more
[03:27:27.600 --> 03:27:34.720]  and more away from all these big proprietary globalist uh companies uh let's get uh david's
[03:27:34.720 --> 03:27:41.840]  take on that because you're the tech expert yeah email is such a such an important question and
[03:27:41.840 --> 03:27:46.560]  and what we've been doing it's it's not ready yet unfortunately it will be soon as we've been
[03:27:46.560 --> 03:27:53.600]  putting together startmail dot com to give you that private um email service uh an email service
[03:27:53.600 --> 03:28:00.000]  that is encrypted so that we don't know again we don't know what you would have in your email
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:06.720]  and i think there's a really interesting take on it which is uh that uh with a most email serve
[03:28:06.720 --> 03:28:13.120]  with basically all the email services all of your emails are in databases that hopefully somebody
[03:28:13.120 --> 03:28:19.920]  has goodwill and enough security barriers to keep other people out but to the extent that you can
[03:28:19.920 --> 03:28:25.200]  you can make an email service where the people running it don't know what it is that you're
[03:28:25.200 --> 03:28:30.640]  emailing and and getting emails yeah let's be clear google on record and so does yahoo all of them
[03:28:30.640 --> 03:28:35.840]  they read everything they have ai computers scanning it and key words and putting it all in
[03:28:35.840 --> 03:28:41.680]  databases yeah and the the re one of the reasons they do that is they you know they're they're
[03:28:41.680 --> 03:28:47.360]  they're building these enormous profiles on use so that uh when you're reading about something
[03:28:47.360 --> 03:28:51.920]  when you're searching and emailing about something they can they can show you an advertisement that's
[03:28:51.920 --> 03:28:56.400]  just about that at that that particular sec and that's how they finance this flavor but that's
[03:28:56.400 --> 03:29:01.440]  only one level to it uh katherine do you have any comments on what the caller brought up yeah i think
[03:29:01.440 --> 03:29:06.080]  what people need to realize is when you are using a microsoft product you're using a product that's
[03:29:06.080 --> 03:29:11.200]  by a company that's known to be after as much data about you as they can get i have some family
[03:29:11.200 --> 03:29:15.040]  members who recently got a microsoft computer and every other time you turn around it was saying
[03:29:15.040 --> 03:29:20.320]  would you like us to report this information back to microsoft like no i i don't need you
[03:29:20.320 --> 03:29:25.440]  reporting where i've gone and how i've used my computer thank you very much so i am definitely
[03:29:25.440 --> 03:29:30.480]  a big believer in using linux as you recommended alex and also you know mac as much as i don't
[03:29:30.480 --> 03:29:35.200]  love apple the mac products are a little more secure than than the microsoft ones sure about a
[03:29:35.200 --> 03:29:38.720]  month ago i got this big letter by the recording industry saying we know you held this pirate
[03:29:38.720 --> 03:29:42.240]  and software i was called up and said look forward to your lawsuit and they backed off right there
[03:29:42.240 --> 03:29:46.640]  it was just a fraud and i said good sue me because i'm going to counter sue you i'm just sick of it

[03:34:13.200 --> 03:34:18.880]  over again at nauseam until the end of the universe seriously the process we're going through is one
[03:34:18.880 --> 03:34:24.400]  that civilization has gone through over and over again and the good news is the globalist at their
[03:34:24.400 --> 03:34:29.280]  davos conferences and others are saying the people are awake to the private corporate
[03:34:29.280 --> 03:34:35.520]  technocracy that controls the major parties in every major western nation and that is moving us
[03:34:35.520 --> 03:34:40.800]  towards this corporate kleptocracy where these interests can just get away with any crime they
[03:34:40.800 --> 03:34:49.440]  want and it is our acquiescence that empowers them take gmo if we won't eat gmo uh it will
[03:34:49.440 --> 03:34:53.360]  extinct their operations if we won't put up with our children being trained to be prisoners in the
[03:34:53.360 --> 03:34:58.880]  government training camps that will shut down if we all just start saying no in little ways
[03:34:58.880 --> 03:35:03.840]  you notice the whole globalist model is about you complying and how great it is to comply well
[03:35:03.840 --> 03:35:09.040]  complying with tyranny has a name it's called slavery and i do not comply with being a slave

[03:35:20.320 --> 03:35:26.400]  points you think people should be made aware of or maybe adding to uh to david's comment about
[03:35:26.400 --> 03:35:31.840]  our next product that will be launched next year email we found that many people have no clue how
[03:35:31.840 --> 03:35:38.640]  email works they all think of it as in the old-fashioned concept where i would send a friend
[03:35:38.640 --> 03:35:43.680]  a confidential letter i'd put it in an envelope i'd seal it i'd put a stamp on it put it in the
[03:35:43.680 --> 03:35:48.800]  mailbox and it'd be delivered by the postman to that friend he opens the envelope and he
[03:35:48.800 --> 03:35:55.360]  reads the confidential letter to him that's not at all how email works email works as follows
[03:35:55.360 --> 03:36:00.480]  the postman comes to your house he says are you robert beans are you the guy sending this today
[03:36:00.480 --> 03:36:05.840]  at this time and then he looks at my envelope the first thing he does he tears off the envelope
[03:36:05.840 --> 03:36:10.560]  he puts it in a plastic bag and takes it to the post office and if you stand next to him at the
[03:36:10.560 --> 03:36:16.160]  traffic light and you do your best you can already read the the mail that i'm sending he's taking it
[03:36:16.160 --> 03:36:22.240]  to the post office and then he's making a copy of that email and he keeps that email copy of you
[03:36:22.800 --> 03:36:27.280]  in their database for the rest of your life and then he goes to my friend and he says are you
[03:36:27.280 --> 03:36:31.440]  this friend and do you live here and there and is it the time and the date that you're accepting
[03:36:31.440 --> 03:36:36.560]  his email and that's how email works and this is a thousand times literally above what the
[03:36:36.560 --> 03:36:40.160]  stause he would do or probably an order of magnitude above that where they would just
[03:36:40.160 --> 03:36:45.120]  occasionally copy a letter and try to read some of the mail in in each germany this is
[03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:50.480]  everything being saved and read by computers that every time a new email comes through cross
[03:36:50.480 --> 03:36:58.560]  reference it with that one with what's right how do they get the rights to reach your private well
[03:36:58.560 --> 03:37:03.280]  they're the new oral order what right do they to put cancer viruses in your vaccine it's a little
[03:37:03.280 --> 03:37:10.640]  gift to you but it's also the the general public who just accepted because they are so used to the
[03:37:10.640 --> 03:37:17.920]  old-fashioned private email sending a private mail in the private mail system but they're not used
[03:37:17.920 --> 03:37:22.400]  to email they don't know about this so they have to be informed and then they have to be presented
[03:37:22.400 --> 03:37:28.240]  alternatives again that's exactly what we're trying to accomplish it's also a little bit
[03:37:28.240 --> 03:37:33.920]  scary that when you have an email that you think you've deleted and you think there's no trace of
[03:37:33.920 --> 03:37:38.880]  it anymore but but there's still a trace of it there's still um other people who can read that
[03:37:38.880 --> 03:37:44.320]  email that you deleted oh it's like google will let you delete your search queries but it's like a
[03:37:44.320 --> 03:37:49.120]  little joke it's like it's like oh here you don't want to walk off the plank into the shark infested
[03:37:49.120 --> 03:37:56.240]  waters here we'll put a blindfold on you it makes it better but the sharks they can still see
[03:37:56.240 --> 03:38:03.520]  me they're nice little sharkies well I think you're an extremist for not I mean how dare you
[03:38:03.520 --> 03:38:08.320]  try to let people actually search things without being tracked right that's a question if you guys
[03:38:08.320 --> 03:38:14.800]  had any blowback have they offered to try to buy you no never we in our whole history had one
[03:38:14.800 --> 03:38:20.160]  police officer in the Netherlands who was investigating a person and he said I want some
[03:38:20.160 --> 03:38:26.160]  information on an IP address that I'd like to see some information on because we believe that they
[03:38:26.160 --> 03:38:33.280]  used your search engine and we were very very clear and simple reply we had to run first of all
[03:38:33.280 --> 03:38:39.920]  you have no warrant so we don't have to reply anything but we'll explain a little bit about
[03:38:39.920 --> 03:38:46.560]  how xquik or start page works we don't store anything and we we're trying to do that because
[03:38:46.560 --> 03:38:53.520]  we're trying to to to safeguard your your civil right and we explain in more detail why we were
[03:38:53.520 --> 03:38:59.920]  doing it and that we have absolutely no track record of of the usage on the site he lost interest
[03:38:59.920 --> 03:39:05.040]  pretty quickly when there was nothing over there to look for even further he thanked us for it because
[03:39:05.040 --> 03:39:10.000]  he says so you guys are also protecting my civil rights said that's correct never heard a word of
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:17.360]  them anymore as the only case in in in our history which we had well that's when I tell you know
[03:39:17.360 --> 03:39:23.280]  police and bureaucrats and people like that that look these are your rights too I mean the world
[03:39:23.280 --> 03:39:28.880]  gets really bad when there's not basic liberties protected Catherine no I was going to say that's
[03:39:28.880 --> 03:39:34.640]  something general patrice should have taken advantage of is the fact that we we will be offering
[03:39:34.640 --> 03:39:39.440]  private email at some future point you know it's it's really an issue for everybody and I should
[03:39:39.440 --> 03:39:44.480]  point out that even in the case of general patrice is as much as we may be frustrated by what he did
[03:39:44.480 --> 03:39:49.680]  he wasn't breaking any laws and you know that there are plenty of things that you know when I take
[03:39:49.680 --> 03:39:55.440]  a shower when I go in the bathroom I shut the door because privacy is a fundamental human value
[03:39:55.440 --> 03:39:59.600]  and you know all of the psychological research that they've done on people have shown that when
[03:39:59.600 --> 03:40:03.600]  you strip away people's privacy and you don't give them an opportunity to just let their hair down
[03:40:03.600 --> 03:40:08.640]  and be themselves they're not hurting anyone it's just being yourself behind closed doors when you
[03:40:08.640 --> 03:40:14.160]  take that away from people people actually become kind of psychotic and so I think just for just
[03:40:14.160 --> 03:40:18.800]  for the value of living in a society where other people are not psychotic we need to value other
[03:40:18.800 --> 03:40:23.520]  people's boundaries and give them an opportunity to have that access to privacy I think it's critically
[03:40:23.520 --> 03:40:29.360]  important no you're right it's total dehumanization to not have privacy and I go back to ancient
[03:40:29.360 --> 03:40:35.600]  Rome or other cultures that had slaves what happened then time and time again was you just
[03:40:35.600 --> 03:40:41.200]  went out to the slave quarters and they knew there wasn't any privacy and people that are in prisons
[03:40:41.200 --> 03:40:45.760]  their slaves and and that's now the prison culture that's the biggest in the world here in the US
[03:40:46.960 --> 03:40:52.400]  is pervading via the tsa the public schools the corporations where they have body scanners now it's
[03:40:52.400 --> 03:40:57.200]  sony in other places where you go there and you're a prisoner and they and they and they you're in
[03:40:57.200 --> 03:41:03.600]  test everybody every week and all of this the idea is you're all prisoners and now the tsa
[03:41:03.600 --> 03:41:09.200]  runs their hands through your hair even short haired men now and it's and they get off on it
[03:41:09.200 --> 03:41:13.760]  it's an act of dominance which is what you do to a prisoner when they're coming into a high
[03:41:13.760 --> 03:41:19.760]  security prism they don't check the hair at low security prisons I mean you're going America is
[03:41:19.760 --> 03:41:25.920]  becoming a giant supermax reeducation camp Catherine well and I think I think the key
[03:41:25.920 --> 03:41:30.240]  as people hear this it's hard not to get scared I mean it's it's it's a reasonable thing to go
[03:41:30.240 --> 03:41:34.640]  ooh that I'm not liking any of that and I think that's why as you know I've been doing this since
[03:41:34.640 --> 03:41:39.760]  1999 trying to wake people up and alert people about the danger of RFID chips and implantable
[03:41:39.760 --> 03:41:45.440]  microchips and and shopper cards and everything else that invades their privacy and I can't tell
[03:41:45.440 --> 03:41:50.480]  you how wonderful it is to be able to say and by the way now that I've scared you to death about
[03:41:50.480 --> 03:41:56.080]  yahoo and bang and google and all the big search engines there is a solution and it's it's free
[03:41:56.080 --> 03:41:59.200]  it's easy to use you can make it your home page you can install it in your browser boom you're
[03:41:59.200 --> 03:42:05.360]  done so some other problems are not as easy to solve and that's why I'm glad you're there Alex so
[03:42:05.360 --> 03:42:09.280]  letting people know what those ones are and giving people the tools that they need to fight back but
[03:42:09.280 --> 03:42:13.440]  but one of the things when you're in the privacy of your own home and you're using a computer and
[03:42:13.440 --> 03:42:18.640]  you've got the door shut and you don't want your next door neighbor or the NSA or some people running
[03:42:18.640 --> 03:42:23.040]  a giant corporation looking over your shoulder that there are some tools that you can use so I'm
[03:42:23.040 --> 03:42:27.520]  super excited about the email I think that's probably going to be the most important thing
[03:42:27.520 --> 03:42:32.960]  that that we will be offering to the world because right now as we've seen with Petraeus there is no
[03:42:32.960 --> 03:42:37.680]  way to privately send an email from one party to another and that's the real scandal I've been
[03:42:37.680 --> 03:42:42.800]  saying that since day one of the media has finally picked up on the fact that the real scandal is
[03:42:42.800 --> 03:42:49.360]  the FBI at first without warrants was reading the CIA director's mail about his girlfriend and
[03:42:49.360 --> 03:42:55.040]  sure morally that's not good to do in a bad move but come on folks they're watching everybody
[03:42:55.040 --> 03:43:00.640]  and and and just like in England it came out four or five years ago with MI5 and MI6 they
[03:43:00.640 --> 03:43:06.720]  were using all the cell phones and the tracker data to track the the parliament and we're using
[03:43:06.720 --> 03:43:12.880]  that to blackmail parliament the bureaucracy and these corporations are playing god now with this
[03:43:12.880 --> 03:43:17.840]  information well and what's exciting I think is is for the first time there will be an email program
[03:43:17.840 --> 03:43:22.880]  available the world's most private email start mail which will not be readable even by the people
[03:43:22.880 --> 03:43:30.240]  handling the servers which is us yeah this is coming out in 2013 it'll be coming out next year
[03:43:30.240 --> 03:43:36.240]  we have rebuilt it absolutely from scratch we've got all the latest software so we we thought we
[03:43:36.240 --> 03:43:40.480]  were going to build this on top of an existing mail program we said uh-uh we got to go back
[03:43:40.480 --> 03:43:44.720]  to every bit invite and rewrite rewrite this thing from the ground up state-of-the-art technology
[03:43:44.720 --> 03:43:49.200]  coming out in 2013 and by the way if people would like to get on the list to get an announcement
[03:43:49.200 --> 03:43:54.240]  when it is available in beta they can just shoot a quick email to beta at startpage.com
[03:43:54.240 --> 03:43:58.000]  just mentioned that you heard us here on the alex jones show and we'll go ahead and get you
[03:43:58.000 --> 03:44:01.920]  an automated reply to let you know you're on the list for an announcement when it comes out
[03:44:01.920 --> 03:44:08.880]  how do you do that again it's beta beta like alpha beta at startpage.com beta and startpage.com
[03:44:08.880 --> 03:44:12.960]  beta start pages say you heard us on alex jones you want to get an announcement when it comes
[03:44:12.960 --> 03:44:17.200]  out and as soon as it's ready we will let your listeners be the beta testers and kick the tires
[03:44:17.200 --> 03:44:21.040]  let us know what they think of the world's most private email. Sure I mean I want to get off all
[03:44:21.040 --> 03:44:26.160]  the emails I've been using um because and again it's not that I have something to hide it's nobody's
[03:44:26.160 --> 03:44:31.760]  business but notice government makes its self-all secret but then tells us individually notice
[03:44:31.760 --> 03:44:35.760]  Katherine how it's gone from we're not spying on you what do you come on Cooke's where you're
[03:44:35.760 --> 03:44:40.160]  ten and now of course we're spying on you what's the big deal. Yeah and and what's scary about that
[03:44:40.160 --> 03:44:44.320]  is it's a transition and and we predicted it 10 years ago we said hey you know they're lying to
[03:44:44.320 --> 03:44:48.800]  you when they say they're not spying but I think it gets even scarier when they say yes you better
[03:44:48.800 --> 03:44:52.800]  believe we're spying on you and and what of it we're going to do more of it. Let's take some more
[03:44:52.800 --> 03:44:57.840]  calls sorry go ahead. Yeah no I was just going to say as as these cybersecurity bills and other
[03:44:57.840 --> 03:45:02.800]  things pass then I think having our company based in Europe is going to be a big advantage.
[03:45:02.800 --> 03:45:08.000]  Yeah because they're going to say federal law I've got to save everything for the government
[03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:11.520]  and I think I'm going to sue them over this and I think that's the answer and and I'm not
[03:45:11.520 --> 03:45:15.440]  litigious but number one's going to cost us a ton of money to have to save everything
[03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:20.480]  and because we just flush it instantly because I don't want to deal with it and the liability
[03:45:20.480 --> 03:45:25.920]  of keeping all this data. I mean it's unbelievable get a legal expert on that right here we need
[03:45:25.920 --> 03:45:30.080]  to have you on just going to be a video Skype from the Netherlands just on the legal aspects
[03:45:30.080 --> 03:45:34.480]  for companies of this but I guess then it get then you get a government waiver once it's law
[03:45:34.480 --> 03:45:39.760]  so then everybody can just lose the data it's unbelievable. It's going to be like carbon credits
[03:45:39.760 --> 03:45:45.120]  right. Yeah exactly plus then they could put out fake data and say it's a leak that's another
[03:45:45.120 --> 03:45:50.000]  popular thing. Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin and Canada you're on the air with our experts go
[03:45:50.000 --> 03:45:57.840]  ahead. Alex and Jeff how you doing? Good go ahead. Good yeah I run a small IT company here in Banff
[03:45:57.840 --> 03:46:04.160]  over to Canada Agenda 21 New World Order headquarters and I just wanted to say a comment
[03:46:04.160 --> 03:46:08.640]  that I will be promoting the start page from here on out for whenever anyone gets the virus
[03:46:08.640 --> 03:46:13.760]  removal and needs their browser updated I'll you know make sure to set up their their start page
[03:46:13.760 --> 03:46:20.560]  as startpage.com and I posted it on my Facebook as well. Well thank you you know that's a good point
[03:46:20.560 --> 03:46:25.680]  because if you're also blocking the sites that makes it hard for them to throw pop-ups up all
[03:46:25.680 --> 03:46:30.000]  sorts of stuff that can then you know give your kid a link or whatever they're surfing to take
[03:46:30.000 --> 03:46:36.160]  your computer over right. Yeah that's true man thank you. Yeah I'm sorry Caller go ahead. Yeah
[03:46:36.160 --> 03:46:40.320]  no I just wanted to say great work guys I really appreciate what you guys were doing and I've
[03:46:40.320 --> 03:46:45.200]  been using it testing you know for a few weeks now and great results with it and I'm definitely
[03:46:45.200 --> 03:46:49.920]  going to be referring it to all my clients from here on out. Oh thank you. There you go very exciting
[03:46:49.920 --> 03:46:54.800]  and again we can just start pulling away from Mr. Google but you know like Catherine was saying
[03:46:54.800 --> 03:47:01.600]  it's all these big companies. Is it shock you guys there isn't more competition in proxy surfing
[03:47:01.600 --> 03:47:09.600]  and proxy email and proxy searches? It's pretty interesting and I don't know why there isn't
[03:47:09.600 --> 03:47:16.080]  except that there's so much money in that personalized advertising that there's so
[03:47:16.080 --> 03:47:20.400]  many companies going in that wrong direction where they're saying you know we're going to help
[03:47:21.200 --> 03:47:27.760]  get even more detailed information about you and sell it to advertisers in order to
[03:47:27.760 --> 03:47:35.120]  personalize advertisements and that's where there's a lot of money and you know it's just the wrong
[03:47:35.120 --> 03:47:46.320]  way to go. The whole concept of bubbling where you're going to see the particular results that are
[03:47:47.200 --> 03:47:54.480]  really tailored to you and it's insidious. It is insidious thank you Caller let me
[03:47:54.480 --> 03:47:58.720]  hit a few positive points here that are very important when the little document cam shot on
[03:47:58.720 --> 03:48:03.920]  this for PrisonBlenna.tv viewers. Supreme Court says it's okay to record cops in Illinois.
[03:48:03.920 --> 03:48:09.040]  Next they'll say it's okay to breathe. What extremism? Supreme Court revives challenge to
[03:48:09.040 --> 03:48:13.840]  Obama health law saying it violates churches first time at right to practice religion.
[03:48:14.720 --> 03:48:20.240]  Am I telling them hey abortion is what you know your God supports. It's the beginning of the end
[03:48:20.240 --> 03:48:25.120]  of the TSA's full body scanners. This is absolutely no one's surprise. The mainstream media last week
[03:48:25.120 --> 03:48:31.840]  ignored a legitimate grassroots protest against the TSA alleged invasive full body scanners.
[03:48:32.480 --> 03:48:36.320]  Alleged invasive full body scanners. They got caught saving the naked images. I mean
[03:48:37.440 --> 03:48:42.160]  oh sure there were whispers of national opt out week and there was quite a bit of that here and
[03:48:42.160 --> 03:48:46.720]  there. The trade publication government security news reported them and then it goes on. They're
[03:48:46.720 --> 03:48:51.680]  clueless. Then they go on to break down some good news that that they are going to try to
[03:48:51.680 --> 03:48:57.040]  move away from the scanners but we'll be covering that more and that's just some of the news that's
[03:48:57.040 --> 03:49:05.200]  up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and continuing we do have that key report up there
[03:49:05.200 --> 03:49:09.200]  that presents key. The top globalist is saying that people are waking up to the globalist.
[03:49:09.760 --> 03:49:14.320]  Catherine let's jam in one more call here before we got a break. John in Texas you're on the year.
[03:49:14.320 --> 03:49:23.120]  Hello. Go ahead buddy. I've been using start page for a number of years and I do research
[03:49:23.120 --> 03:49:32.320]  through that. I also use what's called registry scrub for XP to wipe off the URLs before I remove
[03:49:32.320 --> 03:49:38.720]  them out of my flash drives when I'm at the house. So when I come back from the library I can do that
[03:49:38.720 --> 03:49:45.920]  so they don't cross handshakes and I get less viruses that way. I also use JAP out of Dresden
[03:49:46.800 --> 03:49:55.840]  which is an anonymizer and I've noticed that some of the libraries block start page
[03:49:57.040 --> 03:50:03.440]  and sometimes if you can't get on start page you can go as quick but also with my own personal
[03:50:03.440 --> 03:50:09.840]  computer at the library I've used JAP and I jump right over their system and I can pull up a start
[03:50:09.840 --> 03:50:15.200]  page or anything else I want to see. That's right. You guys were nodding your heads. A big brother
[03:50:15.200 --> 03:50:20.400]  doesn't like people using start page. You know it's really disturbing. There are some library
[03:50:20.400 --> 03:50:28.160]  systems that won't let you use start page. We must know what you are eating. Do you have freedom?
[03:50:28.160 --> 03:50:34.400]  Yeah and they especially don't like the proxy service which lets you anonymously click without
[03:50:34.400 --> 03:50:40.560]  being tracked onto the site you want to visit. And again that the library they know what computer
[03:50:40.560 --> 03:50:45.280]  you got on. They actually have your name. It's that I guess that they want the loving NSA. It's

[03:51:14.080 --> 03:51:19.440]  because of some terrorist threat. They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming. They want that
[03:51:19.440 --> 03:51:24.480]  attack to come. Joel Scowzen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic

[03:51:38.960 --> 03:51:43.840]  and won't be able to get out of town because there'll be absolute panic. There is no preparedness

[03:55:35.920 --> 03:55:40.080]  Dr. Catherine Albrecht, I want to thank both of you for being here. We're going to meet after
[03:55:40.080 --> 03:55:44.240]  the show today and also do an interview for the nightly news but we'll save it till next week.
[03:55:45.120 --> 03:55:48.560]  I'm tempted to get you to go out on the street actually with the reporters and say,
[03:55:48.560 --> 03:55:51.280]  do you know they're saving this? Do you know they're doing this and have you guys do it?
[03:55:51.280 --> 03:55:57.120]  We'll see if you're game for that right after the broadcast here. But let's talk to Ryan in
[03:55:57.120 --> 03:56:02.160]  Texas listening on our big affiliate that covers all of Dallas and Fort Worth, 1630 a.m. I've
[03:56:02.160 --> 03:56:06.240]  promised by the way to come up there and speak to their listeners. Again, I did it earlier this year.
[03:56:06.800 --> 03:56:12.240]  1630 a.m. KKGM. You've got a quick question. Ryan, go ahead.
[03:56:13.280 --> 03:56:18.720]  I do. I just started a t-shirt company based on pro-freedom stuff and I wanted to ask them.
[03:56:18.720 --> 03:56:25.600]  I've been strongly recommended to get Google Analytics and go with a SEO, a search engine
[03:56:25.600 --> 03:56:31.040]  optimizer. What alternatives would you recommend if I didn't want to be part of Google's little
[03:56:31.040 --> 03:56:37.120]  game plan? And the last question I had was just about security. What do you guys recommend
[03:56:37.120 --> 03:56:40.960]  for the website? Because the last thing I want to do is give up any of my customer's information.
[03:56:41.760 --> 03:56:46.000]  You know, that's a really interesting point that you brought up because
[03:56:46.880 --> 03:56:53.600]  Google offers all sorts of really great products for free that happen to give them an enormous
[03:56:53.600 --> 03:56:57.440]  amount of because they're really getting it with a spying. But I mean, just like fair trade or
[03:56:57.440 --> 03:57:02.240]  free trade, you know, coffee and all that stuff. This is the movement where people can vote with
[03:57:02.240 --> 03:57:07.680]  their energy and where they go to start a whole industry saying, hey, you know, we're not spying
[03:57:07.680 --> 03:57:12.960]  on you. And nobody has to be perfect up front. It's a process of being aware of it. We're not
[03:57:12.960 --> 03:57:17.520]  judging anybody out there in business who's part of this at one way or another. I'm trying to get
[03:57:17.520 --> 03:57:27.200]  informed to get better myself as well. And there are no good free alternatives to to that tracking
[03:57:27.200 --> 03:57:31.360]  sort of website tracking system. If you the architecture itself is being designed, wonder
[03:57:31.360 --> 03:57:36.400]  who was behind that same folks invented the web in SA. Right. And unless you're willing to spend a
[03:57:36.400 --> 03:57:41.680]  lot of money, that's how you that's how you can get really good data quickly and give it to them.
[03:57:41.680 --> 03:57:51.280]  So there are there's log file analysis tools that are free and and may be good enough for you,
[03:57:51.280 --> 03:57:57.040]  but it's it's sure a product they they can make. Well, we're going to have to have you both back
[03:57:57.040 --> 03:58:01.280]  up via Skype and Dr. Catherine Albright. Thank you, Collar. Sorry, the other collars were out of
[03:58:01.280 --> 03:58:06.560]  time. Collars from Wisconsin and California, you name it. Catherine, closing comments here in the
[03:58:06.560 --> 03:58:11.680]  last minute. I was just going to say, you know, that's such evidence right there. It's all free.
[03:58:11.680 --> 03:58:16.000]  And people think, wow, it's cool and it's free, but you're paying with your privacy. So I would
[03:58:16.000 --> 03:58:21.600]  say forget about Google it, start page it guys. There is hope. And if you guys support start page,
[03:58:21.600 --> 03:58:25.520]  we can start building all these other tools for you too. I would love to. You guys have grown
[03:58:25.520 --> 03:58:30.000]  incredibly info wars has grown because of people's support. And what you were all just platforms
[03:58:30.000 --> 03:58:34.480]  helping each other banding together to try to make the world a better for your place. If not,
[03:58:34.480 --> 03:58:40.880]  it's going to be very, very nightmarish and dark indeed. Great job. Robert Bain, CEO, David
[03:58:40.880 --> 03:59:05.680]  Bodnick founder. Thank you for listening to GCN. Thank you. Visit GCN live.com today.
