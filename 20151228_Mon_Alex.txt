[00:00.000 --> 00:11.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.800 --> 00:19.360]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.360 --> 00:32.440]  Texas Alex Jones Sunsets on 2015 now only three days left thank you so much
[00:32.440 --> 00:37.480]  for joining us my friends we're live broadcasting worldwide it is Monday the
[00:37.480 --> 00:45.920]  28th day of December 2015 as we prepare to plunge into 2016 and beyond one of
[00:45.920 --> 00:52.600]  the first major preppers and of course anti-New World Order researchers Steve
[00:52.600 --> 00:59.360]  Quayle always thought-provoking we'll be joining us in the second hour today I
[00:59.360 --> 01:08.280]  intend to have open phones as well but I was really thinking yesterday while I
[01:08.280 --> 01:22.800]  was out hiking with my son on the Austin Greenbelt about what really is
[01:22.800 --> 01:27.840]  happening to our culture and our society removing who the major players are
[01:27.840 --> 01:33.920]  even the controllers or even what their master plan is where it's going what's
[01:33.920 --> 01:41.720]  wrong with us and I don't just mean Americans obviously I mean the planet
[01:41.720 --> 01:53.320]  itself what's wrong with us and it comes down to what many historians have
[01:53.320 --> 02:00.320]  pointed out many sociologists many anthropologists many psychologists but
[02:00.320 --> 02:10.160]  also just common sense breakdown shows that we are a very very very sick
[02:10.160 --> 02:18.080]  society we are a rotting society Matt Drudge was here a few months ago he was
[02:18.080 --> 02:23.200]  criticized by some of the corporate media for saying that many Americans are
[02:23.200 --> 02:29.160]  sick mentally we have a very sick country and he didn't say that from a
[02:29.160 --> 02:35.400]  position of oh I'm smart I'm successful and you're sick and pathetic he said it
[02:35.400 --> 02:47.400]  with fear or or better word be concerned maybe horror because let me tell you you
[02:47.400 --> 02:51.080]  go out into any quote progressive liberal area and boy conservatives have
[02:51.080 --> 02:56.480]  got their problems too but you go into a trendy area and you call for banning
[02:56.480 --> 03:02.680]  free speech you call for restricting freedom you call for any evil you can
[03:02.680 --> 03:07.640]  imagine but say it's for the Democratic Party and they will salute and run that
[03:07.640 --> 03:17.120]  idea up the flagpole they're dangerous very dangerous and the climate for true
[03:17.120 --> 03:29.520]  oppression for hardcore execution of totalitarianism has never been ripe or
[03:29.520 --> 03:34.280]  not just here in the United States but all over the world and you add super
[03:34.280 --> 03:40.200]  weapons and huge populations and media and most the public in the western world
[03:40.200 --> 03:48.840]  unable to tie their shoelaces politically or even physically it is a
[03:48.840 --> 03:57.760]  time bomb of biblical proportions and everything else we look at is just
[03:57.760 --> 04:03.640]  polishing silverware on the deck of the Titanic 30 minutes into it hitting an
[04:03.640 --> 04:08.680]  iceberg it's a fool's errand and I consider it cover all this it's
[04:08.680 --> 04:11.800]  interesting it's entertaining it's informative it's what new listeners
[04:11.800 --> 04:17.080]  will be into and I can't consider and be repetitive about globalism but without
[04:17.080 --> 04:24.080]  even doing any research on fluoride this weekend I saw a newscast and three
[04:24.080 --> 04:28.800]  mainstream news articles saying okay maybe it's not good for you maybe it's
[04:28.800 --> 04:34.520]  bad you say well what does that mean it means folks that they know it's all
[04:34.520 --> 04:37.920]  coming out it was done by design and they're trying to walk some of this
[04:37.920 --> 04:41.960]  stuff back now it's in the London Guardian today about how bad fluoride is
[04:41.960 --> 04:47.920]  for him and you say well you say things are so bad but now good things are
[04:47.920 --> 04:53.040]  happening exactly it is a mixed bag is what we're talking about we're in the
[04:53.040 --> 04:58.680]  fights what I'm getting to stay with us it's a big broadcast
[04:58.680 --> 05:04.160]  GOP presidential hopeful Rand Paul as introduced legislation intended to block
[05:04.160 --> 05:08.640]  any effort by the incumbent president to enforce gun control by executive action
[05:08.640 --> 05:13.040]  Paul's legislation named the separation of powers restoration and second
[05:13.040 --> 05:16.920]  amendment protection act would render any action on gun legislation by the
[05:16.920 --> 05:21.860]  president which circumvents Congress as advisory only in nature Paul's bill would
[05:21.860 --> 05:26.160]  apply to any executive action on gun control that either infringes upon
[05:26.160 --> 05:30.240]  congressional authority or potentially violates the second amendment the bill
[05:30.240 --> 05:34.480]  then mandates that once an executive action has been classified as advisory
[05:34.480 --> 05:38.960]  only it would require Congress to pass it in order for it to take effect the bill
[05:38.960 --> 05:43.320]  also outlines that it is within their power for a state official member of
[05:43.320 --> 05:47.160]  Congress or a person affected by an executive action on gun control to
[05:47.160 --> 05:51.320]  launch a civil lawsuit the legislation will be fast tracked through the Senate
[05:51.320 --> 05:55.640]  is expected to be made priority after the Christmas recess you can find more

[08:31.800 --> 08:59.080]  to the center and what is the symptom of the universe that's written in our eyes
[08:59.080 --> 09:09.080]  try to answer that question today thank you for joining us 2015 is on its death
[09:09.080 --> 09:20.800]  bed right now the fire that began 362 days ago is almost out of its eyes but
[09:20.800 --> 09:27.520]  was once a baby and then a child and then a man is now crawling into its death
[09:27.520 --> 09:34.800]  bed at a whole nother year a whole nother orbit of the sun is about to
[09:34.800 --> 09:44.600]  begin but still humankind looks down into the dirt and worships the gods of
[09:44.600 --> 09:49.720]  Madison Avenue and Wall Street the gods that would take their collective soul
[09:49.720 --> 10:02.680]  and bargain it sell it for the perception of success wheels within wheels
[10:02.680 --> 10:09.720]  counterfeits of copies that were never real to begin with frauds built upon
[10:09.720 --> 10:23.520]  lies built upon shaky ground built upon an attempt for fallen men to play God
[10:29.640 --> 10:35.840]  where to start as usual there's too much news so let me just calmly I really
[10:35.840 --> 10:39.960]  want to try to be calm today please for part of the broadcast just give you some
[10:39.960 --> 10:45.000]  of the headlines and then you can connect the dots however you'd like here's
[10:45.000 --> 10:51.840]  the London Guardian adding fluoride to water supply may have no benefits say
[10:51.840 --> 11:00.680]  experts and then you read the article the headline should be top experts and
[11:00.680 --> 11:07.280]  hundreds of studies show lower IQ and children bladder cancer bone cancer and
[11:07.280 --> 11:13.160]  reduced fertility it actually says that in the fourth paragraph that's the major
[11:13.160 --> 11:17.720]  paper in England and the English paper of Europe the most read paper probably in
[11:17.720 --> 11:26.000]  the world it's also in the Daily Mail oh I may have heard that before 20 years
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.640]  ago on a show host of Alex Jones and by the way I don't want credit for that but
[11:31.640 --> 11:40.800]  they had almost 400 articles last Monday eight days ago a syndicated column by
[11:40.800 --> 11:46.360]  Rachel Maddow in the Washington Post Chicago Tribune LA Times I mean it was
[11:46.360 --> 11:51.120]  in you could see the numbers it was like 387 or something the next day it was
[11:51.120 --> 11:54.200]  even more was in more papers the next day I didn't add them together I think
[11:54.200 --> 12:00.640]  it was like 700 papers in two days saying I am totally insane and believe
[12:00.640 --> 12:08.840]  that Obama sends tornadoes and that wasp live under the the the UN building but
[12:08.840 --> 12:16.480]  well and then it would mix in there and he says fluoride's bad for you
[12:16.920 --> 12:21.360]  no different versions one of our original like five pages long but a lot
[12:21.360 --> 12:25.720]  of papers cut it down so I don't know which version you read and you sit there
[12:25.720 --> 12:31.040]  I mean I've got 26 Harvard studies hundreds of Japanese Chinese I've got
[12:31.040 --> 12:36.400]  dozens and dozens of University of Texas studies some of them back in the 30s
[12:36.400 --> 12:41.160]  rat studies reducing fertility lowering their cognitive ability that's their
[12:41.160 --> 12:48.520]  thinking their IQs the physical IQ of North Americans since fluoridation in
[12:48.520 --> 12:56.320]  1947 is down upwards of 20 points and it's accelerated I could pull up the
[12:56.320 --> 13:00.040]  main I mean folks it's not that we're not getting educated we've been hit with a
[13:00.040 --> 13:07.880]  chemical weapon that's one article I've got of literally probably 150 today
[13:07.880 --> 13:12.760]  conservatively like it's probably 200 articles each one just as important as
[13:12.760 --> 13:18.400]  that and you read oh it may not help you and then you read the article cuz it's
[13:18.400 --> 13:23.920]  like they've got to tell you they think the public so stunned now that when
[13:23.920 --> 13:28.000]  their reporters come to them who are well-meaning people like Haroon
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.120]  Sid Quay at the London Guardian and says all these experts are coming out even
[13:34.120 --> 13:37.320]  people in the National Health Service of England say take it out of the water they
[13:37.320 --> 13:43.040]  go yeah go ahead and say it might not help people because then it's like told
[13:43.040 --> 13:47.240]  like hi my name's Count Dracula live in the castle up the hill you have a nice
[13:47.240 --> 13:55.280]  little cottage here do you mind if I come in sure come on in oh thank you I've
[13:55.280 --> 14:03.600]  got to go now but thanks for inviting me in I'll be back they metaphysically have
[14:03.600 --> 14:10.320]  to tell you what they're doing and folks I've got news for you most water
[14:10.320 --> 14:17.320]  supplies the United States get their fluoride from China and I my main goal is
[14:17.320 --> 14:20.200]  to just report something here and challenge listeners to call local news
[14:20.200 --> 14:24.360]  and the local news does investigations and we got Oklahoma and Arkansas of all
[14:24.360 --> 14:28.200]  places a few years ago they did local newscast on what we talked about thank
[14:28.200 --> 14:33.240]  God that's the listeners taking action and actually went and got the Chinese
[14:33.240 --> 14:37.280]  made fluoride that just says fluoride in the bag from China has a skull and
[14:37.280 --> 14:41.880]  crossbones they went and tested it and in one town it had 300 plus chemicals and
[14:41.880 --> 14:48.040]  the other had 200 something lead mercury arsenic you name it they don't just put
[14:48.040 --> 14:53.320]  hydrofluorosalic acid water they don't just put sodium fluoride in the water
[14:53.320 --> 15:01.960]  they put hundreds of chemicals including ground-up radium in limestone
[15:01.960 --> 15:09.880]  radium radium radioactive isotopes people don't believe it they good they
[15:09.880 --> 15:14.320]  call local news they laugh they go stick a Geiger counter to city pipes off the
[15:14.320 --> 15:18.960]  charts folks and that's what I mean it's a twilight zone episode that's one
[15:18.960 --> 15:24.240]  article and so where are we now that every few days I see articles going oh
[15:24.240 --> 15:28.280]  you might not want to give your kids fluoride it gives them fluorosis they're
[15:28.280 --> 15:32.640]  trying to creep out and go maybe we were a little wrong folks they weren't wrong
[15:32.640 --> 15:39.840]  they knew what they did and they've moved on now to stacked genes in corn and
[15:39.840 --> 15:50.440]  wheat and soybeans that are designed to literally transmutate that's not supposed
[15:50.440 --> 15:55.480]  to happen unless you quote have cancer mutation start in the genetic and an
[15:55.480 --> 15:59.000]  embryonic level and generally play out from there these are mutations while
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.080]  you're alive while you're already run your original genetic program they're
[16:04.080 --> 16:09.160]  injecting it in and we're getting mutations never before seen and just
[16:09.160 --> 16:18.080]  thousands of new cancers thousands thousands are arriving plagues everywhere
[16:18.080 --> 16:23.400]  everywhere are 25 30 40 year old women I I know and friends know they're just
[16:23.400 --> 16:30.800]  dying of lung cancer everywhere they don't even smoke because there's a
[16:30.800 --> 16:35.040]  particular virus that said a family of viruses that have been found in many
[16:35.040 --> 16:40.400]  vaccines it's beyond the SV 40 that particularly hits women and gives them
[16:40.400 --> 16:44.880]  lung cancer and see this is this is this is a different people like males can't
[16:44.880 --> 16:49.520]  handle mercury because our blood brain barrier is not as strong so 80 some
[16:49.520 --> 16:54.640]  percent of autistics are our boys we're not as strong blood brain barrier as
[16:54.640 --> 16:59.920]  women but then other areas women are weaker and man they and then I get to
[16:59.920 --> 17:04.080]  hear about feminist at Time Magazine or mad that Harrison Ford got paid more
[17:04.080 --> 17:09.400]  money than the girl that played Ray that's how they stand up for you while
[17:09.400 --> 17:16.280]  the establishment slowly murders a queue and I'll be at a party or something
[17:16.280 --> 17:19.800]  will be some weird feminist trying to dominate shooting their mouth off trying
[17:19.800 --> 17:22.960]  to say stuff to men to make them guilty guys groveling to them and I'll just go
[17:22.960 --> 17:28.760]  listen this is an end of the human race program it's a scientific takeover stop
[17:28.760 --> 17:33.480]  coming in here to exercise your assertiveness and dominate people then
[17:33.480 --> 17:36.480]  they start usually groveling or apologizing and I go listen I don't
[17:36.480 --> 17:40.360]  want you to grovel or apologize I know nobody ever stood up to you you've
[17:40.360 --> 17:44.120]  been trained to be a basket case you're under attack you've been given a false
[17:44.120 --> 17:48.120]  imprint of what you're supposed to be threatened by so the globalist can
[17:48.120 --> 17:52.360]  savage you psychologically culturally spiritually mentally and you're
[17:52.360 --> 17:59.440]  unaware of what's even going on I mean it's a joke to walk around in the public
[17:59.440 --> 18:04.760]  and to know the type of attack they're under health experts are calling for a
[18:04.760 --> 18:08.360]  more tournament water fluoridation claiming that the benefits of such
[18:08.360 --> 18:11.400]  schemes are opposed to those topical fluoride directly applied to the teeth
[18:11.400 --> 18:15.840]  are unproven furthermore critic site studies showing identifying a number of
[18:15.840 --> 18:20.400]  possible negative associations of fluoride including bone cancer bladder
[18:20.400 --> 18:28.800]  cancer hyperthyroidism just exploding in women hip fractures and lower IQ oh the
[18:28.800 --> 18:34.040]  London Guardian where's my apologies from all the conservative hosts that
[18:34.040 --> 18:37.640]  attacked me oh the 28 pages we have senators and congressmen who've looked
[18:37.640 --> 18:43.400]  at it say our government stood down protected the Bin Laden's ordered the
[18:43.400 --> 18:52.120]  FBI in five states not to stop the hijackers bare minimum order to stand
[18:52.120 --> 18:58.480]  down attacked the country that didn't attack us Iraq oh 9-11 truth was right
[18:58.480 --> 19:04.440]  again oh where's the apology I could go on for days we broke Benghazi the week
[19:04.440 --> 19:08.080]  it happened and said it was a hit for missiles and I'm not bragging but I'm
[19:08.080 --> 19:11.880]  willing to go up to the every machine gun nation throw political hang grenades
[19:11.880 --> 19:17.080]  in so so just understand what everybody else sits back and makes fun of Alex
[19:17.080 --> 19:20.760]  Jones or info wars or says we're wrong and we lie about this or that that's
[19:20.760 --> 19:24.160]  because they're either little cowards their gutter snipes or they're on the
[19:24.160 --> 19:29.840]  globalist payroll we will continue to trailblaze 110% committed to the truth
[19:29.840 --> 19:33.680]  and we'll stumble we'll fall we're always going towards the objective given it
[19:33.680 --> 19:39.520]  are 110% that's my commitment to you going in 2016 I told you a year ago I was
[19:39.520 --> 19:44.240]  turning the heat up returning up even more next year because we're going in
[19:44.240 --> 19:49.760]  through and beyond we're on a collision course with the new world order and
[19:49.760 --> 19:55.720]  nothing but the good Lord above's gonna stop us because if God be with us who
[19:55.720 --> 20:02.040]  can be against us something just happened that is explained why survival

[20:10.880 --> 20:15.280]  believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof revealing their secret could land

[24:21.880 --> 24:27.560]  to be faded to telling only lies
[24:27.560 --> 24:33.560]  imagine working for MSNBC but my dreams they're brief folks
[24:33.560 --> 24:41.880]  they know the program Rachel Maddow, Melissa Harris Perry
[24:41.880 --> 24:44.840]  they're different programs
[24:46.360 --> 24:56.280]  they're the most dishonorable heartless, soulless scum you could ever imagine
[24:57.400 --> 25:01.160]  I got into my whole quandary my problem because I could spend an entire three
[25:01.160 --> 25:06.760]  hour four hour show or now four hours 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central
[25:06.760 --> 25:10.840]  I could spend days really on this one article adding fluoride
[25:10.840 --> 25:15.320]  to water supply may have no benefits say experts
[25:15.960 --> 25:19.240]  critics call for endoscheme designed to prevent two decaying children saying
[25:19.240 --> 25:22.840]  its effectiveness remains unproven so they run that spin and then get into oh
[25:22.840 --> 25:27.640]  here's all these studies that it gives you cancer and lowers your IQ
[25:27.640 --> 25:31.400]  I mean you don't drink sunscreen to not get a suntan
[25:31.400 --> 25:35.560]  or not get burned and it's not even fluoride they take
[25:35.560 --> 25:40.600]  heavy metal, gran yard reagent, toxic waste from the fertilizer and metal
[25:40.600 --> 25:44.920]  smelting and other industrial systems and they have a 1940s waiver
[25:44.920 --> 25:51.160]  World War II waiver so then process it and put it into feeds
[25:51.160 --> 25:55.880]  put it into foods put it into medicines put it into anything they want
[25:55.880 --> 26:00.440]  now they do have a strange law that passed later in the 70s you can look it up
[26:00.440 --> 26:05.400]  where if you ever notice you'll get lawn fertilizer it'll say not for crops
[26:05.400 --> 26:08.840]  because it's got toxins in it
[26:10.840 --> 26:14.680]  so they won't even let you put this in some of the
[26:14.680 --> 26:20.920]  crop fertilizer by the way they use fluoride as a pesticide still
[26:20.920 --> 26:24.680]  EPA said take it out four years ago they still haven't done it
[26:24.680 --> 26:27.640]  and it bio accumulates they spray it on grapes they spray it up basically on
[26:27.640 --> 26:31.480]  everything it's one of the top pesticides it's
[26:31.480 --> 26:36.440]  been a pesticide used for 200 years in european and the united states
[26:36.440 --> 26:40.920]  over 200 it was used right around after the revolutionary war
[26:40.920 --> 26:44.280]  it's one of the oldest pesticides known oh but the scientists didn't know when
[26:44.280 --> 26:47.400]  they put in the water what it would do they put
[26:47.400 --> 26:54.200]  an excitotoxin adjuvant bug killer
[26:56.200 --> 27:01.080]  into your food and water and see i can just keep going for hours
[27:01.080 --> 27:04.840]  it's a fact and so what does that say about who
[27:04.840 --> 27:12.280]  runs things riddle me this for five years our hijack criminal government
[27:12.280 --> 27:18.600]  has been funding al-qaeda known as al-nazra same group admittedly
[27:18.600 --> 27:23.640]  remember that roiders headline us says russia bombing the good rebels
[27:23.640 --> 27:29.400]  the al-nazra group al-qaeda of syria with a straight face first paragraph and it
[27:29.400 --> 27:34.120]  was all over the news how dare you bomb the good guys al-qaeda
[27:34.120 --> 27:37.880]  just throwing it in our face rubbing it in our face
[27:37.880 --> 27:42.200]  and then they send them over there and they murder over 300 000 people
[27:42.200 --> 27:48.200]  the majority of them christians in the most heinous ways they press the young
[27:48.200 --> 27:51.720]  girls down to age five into sex slavery and then
[27:51.720 --> 27:57.400]  hundreds of jihadi's line up and rape them until they die
[27:57.400 --> 28:01.480]  two three days no food no water being beaten savagely
[28:01.480 --> 28:08.360]  until they die look it up syrian rebels rape women and children
[28:08.360 --> 28:14.200]  to death look up that headline they eat hearts on television and who does our
[28:14.200 --> 28:20.680]  government fund this very scum oh they put bug poison in your
[28:20.680 --> 28:24.680]  water and spray it on most of the powdered
[28:24.680 --> 28:29.560]  preparations for biscuits bread pancake mix
[28:29.560 --> 28:35.320]  300 parts 600 parts 900 parts per million look it up
[28:35.320 --> 28:40.120]  do you know what 1.6 parts per million does to an IQ
[28:40.120 --> 28:43.320]  on average in federal studies 10 point reductions
[28:43.320 --> 28:50.760]  every three years of use devastatedly stupid you'd use 20 30 points
[28:50.760 --> 28:54.520]  if you were an average person you're now mentally retarded
[28:54.520 --> 28:58.840]  if you were a genius you're now just smart
[28:58.840 --> 29:04.040]  isn't that a gift from the loving people oh but judge a tree by its fruits
[29:04.040 --> 29:07.720]  everything else they do infant mortality is exploding back up off the charts
[29:07.720 --> 29:12.120]  now pediatric cancers are up tens of
[29:12.120 --> 29:15.400]  thousands of percentage points by the way that's just a few cancers
[29:15.400 --> 29:18.920]  i actually looked it up this weekend some cancers that didn't exist 20 years
[29:18.920 --> 29:21.320]  ago are up hundreds of thousands of percentage
[29:21.320 --> 29:24.760]  points in their growth curves so they didn't exist before
[29:24.760 --> 29:29.880]  and now they're just everywhere and it's all by design and any of the real
[29:29.880 --> 29:32.680]  treatments or things they develop testing on us
[29:32.680 --> 29:39.640]  are secured into the globalist reservations their techno city systems

[33:20.200 --> 33:29.320]  it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[33:29.320 --> 33:32.120]  when you start reading the globalist white papers when you start reading the
[33:32.120 --> 33:35.720]  globalist textbooks that they used at phd and above level
[33:35.720 --> 33:39.240]  when they talk about us as ugly animals that must be exterminated
[33:39.240 --> 33:42.600]  that must have our free will taken that must be dumbed down
[33:42.600 --> 33:46.040]  before their world government can come into place and then how we'll all be
[33:46.040 --> 33:49.800]  systematically wiped out with designer bio weapons
[33:49.800 --> 33:53.000]  that the controllers will be given immunity to
[33:53.000 --> 33:58.280]  you know why ian flaming wrote moon raker at that point
[33:58.280 --> 34:02.520]  and then well football games don't matter as much as they did
[34:02.520 --> 34:05.960]  or somebody cutting you off in traffic doesn't
[34:05.960 --> 34:09.720]  really matter anymore because you don't take it personal anymore
[34:09.720 --> 34:12.840]  you are now awake while the rest of the public sleeps
[34:12.840 --> 34:18.360]  but you're not a psychological spiritual cultural vampire
[34:18.360 --> 34:22.200]  like the globalist there are two types of people
[34:22.200 --> 34:25.480]  in general those that are awake those that aren't
[34:25.480 --> 34:29.400]  but in the group that's awake there is the
[34:29.400 --> 34:36.280]  separation of those that decide to use the ignorance of the general public
[34:36.280 --> 34:39.160]  against them and those that decide to try to
[34:39.160 --> 34:42.680]  empower the general public and the general public's been given all these
[34:42.680 --> 34:45.400]  different programs all these different learned responses
[34:45.400 --> 34:48.680]  all these different hypnotic suggestions
[34:48.680 --> 34:51.880]  you name it it's all being used and tested
[34:51.880 --> 34:55.400]  as they develop better and better systems of control
[34:55.400 --> 34:59.640]  you're looking at engineered victims and they're certainly dangerous they're
[34:59.640 --> 35:02.440]  certainly arrogant they're certainly narcissistic
[35:02.440 --> 35:05.880]  they're certainly sociopathic they're certainly insecure
[35:05.880 --> 35:10.200]  they're they're it's a mix of what they've done to the public
[35:10.200 --> 35:15.000]  and it's very easy to hate them it's very easy to want to hide from them
[35:15.000 --> 35:19.960]  but we have to get in there and find as many of these people that still have
[35:19.960 --> 35:23.000]  some consciousness as we can to try to get in there and
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.280]  shake them out of their trance so they can start looking around them and get
[35:26.280 --> 35:32.440]  out of this matrix it really comes down to that
[35:34.200 --> 35:38.440]  so the worst thing you can do is sardonically start having the attitude
[35:38.440 --> 35:41.640]  of the establishment and just seeing the public as a bunch of dumb
[35:41.640 --> 35:45.320]  limits and then getting off on that having some
[35:45.320 --> 35:49.080]  sort of sick satisfaction
[35:50.440 --> 35:54.680]  that's the worst thing you can do because this isn't funny
[35:54.680 --> 36:00.920]  and don't think all this cultural evil all this cultural twistedness
[36:00.920 --> 36:06.120]  isn't going to blow back on everybody that's another big lie the establishment
[36:06.120 --> 36:11.400]  told themselves that they somehow can transcend
[36:11.400 --> 36:14.520]  what they've helped do
[36:15.720 --> 36:19.560]  now i just mentioned one article and went off on a 30 minute
[36:19.560 --> 36:24.440]  jag about it but it's a pretty big deal
[36:24.440 --> 36:28.600]  they've always known that you need a very small amount of calcium fluoride
[36:28.600 --> 36:32.120]  you're died or you'll die and it's using bone
[36:32.120 --> 36:36.040]  formation a lot of other activities in the body
[36:36.040 --> 36:41.800]  what they put in the water is not calcium fluoride
[36:42.920 --> 36:51.080]  it's jacked up electrified acid
[36:51.720 --> 36:56.680]  that then is an adjuvant so they don't have to put as many of the other drugs
[36:56.680 --> 36:59.800]  in the water supply that they had for social engineering
[36:59.800 --> 37:04.040]  it's a booster a money saver
[37:04.040 --> 37:07.880]  don't you understand you want to make fun of the public
[37:07.880 --> 37:11.640]  folks they're drugged they were raised in front of televisions from birth
[37:11.640 --> 37:16.600]  it's a wonder they can function at the level they can
[37:19.400 --> 37:23.320]  and again that's what this comes down to it's the incredible
[37:23.320 --> 37:30.760]  over-the-top epic legendary truth that we are living in the beginning of a
[37:30.760 --> 37:35.400]  directed scientific dictatorship that is meant to end
[37:35.400 --> 37:38.440]  humanity as we know it and again that's the emergency
[37:38.440 --> 37:41.320]  transmission i continue to send out because
[37:41.320 --> 37:45.800]  outside of that all of this is just window dressing
[37:50.440 --> 37:55.000]  that's one article out of hundreds
[37:56.120 --> 38:00.360]  let me get into some of these articles i mean look at this one obama care is
[38:00.360 --> 38:05.320]  sucking is sucking up to 10 percent of american's incomes
[38:05.320 --> 38:09.640]  and that's on top of what health care used to cost i mean just devastating
[38:09.640 --> 38:14.440]  talk about a wet blanket on the economy that's it uh the cashless society
[38:14.440 --> 38:17.160]  cometh european nations such as sweden denmark
[38:17.160 --> 38:20.760]  are eradicating cash the average person
[38:20.760 --> 38:26.680]  thinks that if they just accept something that gives them power over it
[38:26.680 --> 38:30.760]  instead of understanding they can then tax you
[38:30.760 --> 38:37.400]  track you control you and then make you pay money to use the digital money
[38:37.400 --> 38:40.840]  it will give them the greatest control over individual freedom and markets the
[38:40.840 --> 38:43.640]  world has ever seen if you think they're rigging markets now
[38:43.640 --> 38:46.920]  you ain't seen nothing yet and they're not rigging markets to make
[38:46.920 --> 38:50.360]  the general public prosperous they're rigging markets
[38:50.360 --> 38:54.360]  to consolidate control but i hear the average yuppie go
[38:54.360 --> 38:57.320]  i don't care i just want to chip it'll be so much easier
[38:57.320 --> 39:01.400]  oh it'll be a lot easier yeah they want to move us to a
[39:01.400 --> 39:04.760]  system where underground economies are impossible because they
[39:04.760 --> 39:10.440]  really care about us we're not being domesticated because we're going to be
[39:10.440 --> 39:14.120]  like shetland ponies on the back hundred acres that
[39:14.120 --> 39:19.960]  the little girls go out to and feed sugar cubes to
[39:19.960 --> 39:23.960]  we're not being domesticated to even be eaten
[39:23.960 --> 39:29.080]  though in the process our organs will be harvested when the elite want to
[39:29.080 --> 39:32.920]  we're being domesticated because we're seen as a dangerous
[39:32.920 --> 39:39.000]  scourge that has to be defanged declawed and chained down before we are
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.600]  decapitated and the chains are going on
[39:42.600 --> 39:48.200]  right now and i'm here transcending all the mindless politics
[39:48.200 --> 39:51.800]  the distractions the diversions and telling you the elite have a plan to go
[39:51.800 --> 39:56.440]  the stars and we ain't in that club
[39:58.040 --> 40:02.440]  and then the clan bashing black people and the black lives matter people
[40:02.440 --> 40:05.000]  running around stirring up trouble for sorrows
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.640]  all of it becomes a sick joke when you go why would they have a weird nazi
[40:09.640 --> 40:15.480]  collaborator running the democratic party
[40:16.520 --> 40:21.160]  because that's who these people are they're not nazis
[40:21.160 --> 40:27.160]  they just like somebody that was so soulless he'd sell out his own people
[40:27.240 --> 40:32.360]  they admire each other it's evil they admire each other for how many
[40:32.360 --> 40:35.800]  people they've killed
[40:43.320 --> 40:46.760]  good god i don't think the average person's red submitted presents these
[40:46.760 --> 40:49.240]  books like i have to mean they're so
[40:49.240 --> 40:51.480]  evil
[40:52.680 --> 40:56.040]  to brag about how he helped create the Khmer Rouge
[40:56.040 --> 40:59.960]  to kill 35 of the population
[41:00.200 --> 41:03.080]  and to watch him at council and farm relations meetings
[41:03.080 --> 41:06.440]  when they salute him and just look at him like he is a
[41:06.440 --> 41:13.400]  rock star only thing these people respect is somebody that's killed millions
[41:13.400 --> 41:19.000]  and that's why i sit there and watch his daughter on tv say she wants our guns
[41:19.000 --> 41:26.360]  and spur race baiting garbage and that's why she just makes me want to throw up
[41:26.360 --> 41:31.320]  i don't even hate her i just see an enemy
[41:33.720 --> 41:37.640]  i just see a threat to my family
[41:39.880 --> 41:43.880]  it's time to grow up folks it's time to assess the real threat
[41:43.880 --> 41:50.440]  we're ready we know the enemy operation we're committed
[41:50.440 --> 41:54.040]  and the most important thing about this broadcast is we're giving insiders who
[41:54.040 --> 41:56.200]  were somewhat compartmentalized a chance to
[41:56.200 --> 42:00.520]  decompartmentalize and to know we're telling the truth
[42:00.520 --> 42:03.720]  and to really ask yourself do you really think you can
[42:03.720 --> 42:08.040]  work with this and it's not going to burn you and your family in the end
[42:08.040 --> 42:11.080]  you may say well i'm just waiting for others to wake up and hopefully you know
[42:11.080 --> 42:14.360]  this thing gets rolled back historically these things get rolled back
[42:14.360 --> 42:17.880]  and i just want to stay out of the way until the pendulum swings the other way
[42:17.880 --> 42:22.920]  they're trying to suspend those laws now and bring in what they call
[42:22.920 --> 42:31.320]  the final revolution and when you read deeper into the final revolution
[42:31.320 --> 42:34.040]  look that term up
[42:34.040 --> 42:41.800]  it is a world ending human ending god event in their words
[42:41.800 --> 42:49.640]  where they overwrite in a giant satanic ritual basically is what all
[42:49.640 --> 42:53.800]  this is the gmo the the the splicing the bugs with
[42:53.800 --> 42:58.280]  humans all the cows with humans growing in utero for
[42:58.280 --> 43:02.040]  harvesting in china you know that's on record
[43:02.040 --> 43:06.600]  they got stocks straight on it 15 years ago i was like reading stock
[43:06.600 --> 43:10.280]  portfolios about cameras and microphones listening and watching
[43:10.280 --> 43:15.480]  and come and say look oh shut up crazy nowadays like sure they watch and listen
[43:15.480 --> 43:18.920]  and and humans being grown inside cows up to
[43:18.920 --> 43:22.200]  full size to get larger organs and you're just like
[43:22.200 --> 43:28.920]  what not in kansas anymore folks people say well why aren't you afraid they'll
[43:28.920 --> 43:32.600]  come get you they already got me they've already got jet
[43:32.600 --> 43:36.360]  spraying aluminum everywhere and they admitted it last week and the plants
[43:36.360 --> 43:39.720]  are dying the bugs are just they're crazy people
[43:39.720 --> 43:45.560]  they're overriding the planet
[43:48.120 --> 43:52.520]  they're playing god and they just believe that they'll develop all these
[43:52.520 --> 43:55.640]  super technologies in the process that will allow them to just
[43:55.640 --> 44:01.240]  repopulate worlds whenever they want like they're god and all i'm
[44:01.240 --> 44:05.720]  saying is i wasn't consulted you weren't consulted
[44:09.080 --> 44:13.320]  guys this monitor is dead in here just a heads up
[44:13.320 --> 44:19.080]  so let me continue uh here um here now let's go back to the news
[44:19.080 --> 44:23.240]  obama care is sucking up to 10 percent of americans incomes
[44:23.240 --> 44:26.760]  fbi wants austin residents to be on high alert but there's no specific threat
[44:26.760 --> 44:29.560]  oh really the open borders and all those jihadi's being brought in
[44:29.560 --> 44:32.520]  tsa hit with lawsuit after nixing body scanner
[44:32.520 --> 44:37.320]  opt out we'll be getting into that tsa quietly moves to make body scanners
[44:37.320 --> 44:39.640]  mandatory and they're going to go on the streets next i'm going to get into
[44:39.640 --> 44:43.400]  that after the break but i kind of got into this
[44:43.400 --> 44:47.480]  story i went off on that jag the cashless society cometh european nations
[44:47.480 --> 44:51.320]  such as sweden and denmark are eradicating cash
[44:51.320 --> 44:55.320]  and they're also creating internal checkpoints and if you criticize any
[44:55.320 --> 44:58.600]  radical muslims you get arrested and now another
[44:58.600 --> 45:03.080]  region corsica of italy has banned all rallies following
[45:03.080 --> 45:06.760]  a series of violent anti-muslim protests because they brought hundreds of
[45:06.760 --> 45:10.200]  thousands into corsica alone and they're they're attacking
[45:10.200 --> 45:13.640]  and raping people so folks fought back so just free speeches banned just like
[45:13.640 --> 45:16.600]  in france and germany they use the threat to then ban our speech
[45:16.600 --> 45:19.960]  as i said with bengazi they're going to ship all the weapons in attack europe
[45:19.960 --> 45:23.000]  when they do they're going to take all of our rights and then ban criticizing
[45:23.000 --> 45:27.160]  the radical muslims that's the response
[45:27.160 --> 45:29.720]  again because the globalists are bringing down the west they've already
[45:29.720 --> 45:32.840]  brought down the middle east africa they want to bring everything down except for
[45:32.840 --> 45:38.360]  their golden fields their elysiums their their controlled

[50:35.960 --> 50:39.320]  nobody's going to tell you you got to look it up for yourself
[50:39.320 --> 50:43.160]  look at this man walks off cliff and plummet 60 feet to his death on christmas
[50:43.160 --> 50:48.280]  day while distracted by his cell phone i see this all the time see these stories
[50:48.280 --> 50:51.320]  all tie together because they won't even save themselves
[50:51.320 --> 50:54.760]  because they're in such a trance they don't even know it
[50:54.760 --> 50:58.040]  we'll be back stay with us
[50:59.720 --> 51:03.080]  the following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA this product is
[51:03.080 --> 51:07.160]  not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease
[51:07.160 --> 51:10.600]  something shocking just happened in a coast guard unit in san diego
[51:10.600 --> 51:13.880]  the old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the
[51:13.880 --> 51:17.560]  young bucks and head-to-head fitness tests how is this even possible
[51:17.560 --> 51:21.160]  turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for
[51:21.160 --> 51:25.080]  a doctor formulated fountain of youth drink called patriot power greens

[54:32.440 --> 54:36.360]  on the rape on the rest of it if they want to attack donald trump is a 9-11

[54:39.400 --> 54:42.920]  destroy them you notice they started attacking him coming on and then dropped
[54:42.920 --> 54:46.680]  it real fast they figured it out and and then now that that's already
[54:46.680 --> 54:49.000]  happened and i know they're watching a little
[54:49.000 --> 54:53.000]  closer that's good good you're learning new world order you're
[54:53.000 --> 54:59.240]  learning cia

[55:28.200 --> 55:31.720]  have you figured that out yet
[55:32.040 --> 55:38.760]  but the folks advising trump are smart real smart
[55:38.760 --> 55:42.280]  they've judged the public they know what's going on
[55:42.280 --> 55:46.920]  the only question is is trump completely real uh compared to hillary is
[55:46.920 --> 55:50.920]  compared to bernie sanders or jeb bush he is
[55:51.480 --> 55:55.240]  everybody loves to pile on trump and exaggerate what he said or take it out

[1:00:47.960 --> 1:00:51.720]  but they love barack obama who you can clearly say
[1:00:51.720 --> 1:00:58.040]  is the commander of isis but the fairy godmother
[1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:04.600]  that delivers the magic beams in the form of high impact toe missiles and

[1:01:22.280 --> 1:01:25.240]  as a reason to get rid of people's free speech see
[1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:29.800]  we have to conform to radical islam we have to give

[1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:40.680]  but now the new york times has blamed shadan hussein
[1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:46.280]  for creating isis even though it's the very group he fought out of saudi arabia
[1:01:46.280 --> 1:01:49.880]  and my saudi arabia was involved in 9 11 to blame iraq so they could be brought
[1:01:49.880 --> 1:01:55.800]  down and install the caliphate in iraq
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:03.400]  but the new york times comes out and they blame donald trump
[1:02:04.440 --> 1:02:10.280]  and they blame saddam hussein people who had nothing to do
[1:02:10.280 --> 1:02:13.000]  with isis

[1:03:12.120 --> 1:03:19.000]  free speech to write but did they kill 150 million people like communist
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.520]  communist during that blacklist had already killed about a hundred million
[1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:26.440]  people and folks were scared over here the whole
[1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:30.040]  movie attack john wane made him to be a devil

[1:03:39.240 --> 1:03:41.960]  by christ
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:45.400]  when i've been around these leftists these types and man they talk about
[1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:49.080]  putting patriots and christians and people in forced labor camps and
[1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:52.120]  every time they get control they do and they are nasty
[1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:55.800]  they are nasty they've got a lot of well-meaning leftists that follow along
[1:03:55.800 --> 1:04:00.360]  behind them
[1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:04.520]  but oh my gosh 200 and something of you didn't get to write screenplays
[1:04:04.520 --> 1:04:08.600]  for a decade and some of you even lost your houses wow

[1:04:35.240 --> 1:04:38.440]  we're gonna come after you we're gonna ship guns in a mexico to blame
[1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:41.400]  you for it we're gonna engage in all the stuff
[1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:44.920]  that makes nixon look like an angel but it's okay because
[1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:50.520]  the lefts behind it i mean exactly what they do everywhere else
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:55.640]  but they're these little egalitarian humanitarian sweethearts
[1:04:55.640 --> 1:04:59.000]  that are going to protect us from john wane
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.680]  the syrian refugee admitted his main goal is not to escape war or ice's
[1:05:02.680 --> 1:05:06.440]  persecution but to convert europeans to islam he said quote
[1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:10.200]  my main goal for leaving to syria is to lead the people to the acceptance of
[1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:13.320]  islam i swear by a law that i only came here for
[1:05:13.320 --> 1:05:16.840]  this one goal i have observed that they are curious and willing to get to know
[1:05:16.840 --> 1:05:19.560]  islam through us and he's not the only one influential
[1:05:19.560 --> 1:05:22.760]  she had recently gave a speech in which she encouraged radical muslims to use
[1:05:22.760 --> 1:05:26.520]  the migrant crisis to quote breed with europeans and conquer their countries
[1:05:26.520 --> 1:05:30.200]  but this modern day islamic conquest is not just happening only in europe
[1:05:30.200 --> 1:05:33.720]  here in the u.s radical muslims are building their own islamic compounds
[1:05:33.720 --> 1:05:37.080]  and communities while telling christians and other non-muslims to keep out and
[1:05:37.080 --> 1:05:40.040]  these communities are rapidly expanding in fact the obama
[1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:44.040]  administration has admitted nearly 400 syrian refugees into the us and see
[1:05:44.040 --> 1:05:47.480]  november 13th paris attacks and only one of them is a christian
[1:05:47.480 --> 1:05:50.840]  but christians comprise about 10 percent of the population in syria so why
[1:05:50.840 --> 1:05:54.520]  isn't the obama administration allowing more christian refugees into the us
[1:05:54.520 --> 1:05:59.160]  i'll let you decide this is kit daniels with info wars dot com

[1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:53.720]  and pledging to stand against it but asking what do we do
[1:09:53.720 --> 1:09:59.880]  how do we attack a false paradigm a false culture a false economy a system
[1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:05.400]  designed to envelop us you go back to the great labors
[1:10:05.400 --> 1:10:11.960]  an allegory of hercules he had defeated all these great beast and monsters and
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:16.040]  finally had to go into the underworld but in the underworld he couldn't see
[1:10:16.040 --> 1:10:21.320]  anything it was darkness and suddenly his strength was used against him
[1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:29.080]  how did hercules finish that greatest of works greatest of labors
[1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:35.160]  my friends we have to recognize that we're under attack
[1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:41.800]  we have to understand how real it is or we don't have any hope
[1:10:41.800 --> 1:10:45.080]  and there is a lot of good news world government's being admitted the fact
[1:10:45.080 --> 1:10:47.320]  that carbon taxes are meant to shut down society and
[1:10:47.320 --> 1:10:50.840]  make the elite even richer is coming out the fact that fluorides killing people
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:54.680]  is all over mainstream news as more and more scientists groups
[1:10:54.680 --> 1:11:00.040]  at the british ministry of health service in our own FDA and EPA say take it
[1:11:00.040 --> 1:11:04.440]  out i read that article on engardian last hour
[1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:08.040]  they'd make fun of you about this phenol eight ten years ago
[1:11:08.040 --> 1:11:11.880]  now they're taking it out of the products the truth is
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:15.080]  voting with our conscience voting with our dollars voting with our feet
[1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:18.040]  voting with our actions is the power we have and that's why
[1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:21.720]  they want the cashless society control grid that's why big banks are
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:25.320]  announcing we're not going to let you have cash you can't use cash in europe
[1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:29.000]  the u.s companies are saying we won't even take a 20
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:32.760]  if you go to places like target because they want to track and control
[1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:36.040]  everything and they want to shut down small cash businesses
[1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:39.320]  they want to shut down amish they want to shut down farmers markets
[1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:42.040]  they want to shut down people selling raw milk
[1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:45.800]  they want to shut down normal human stability
[1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:52.120]  and sustainability under sustainability everything's the opposite with them
[1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:54.840]  steve quill is going to be joining us 20 minutes to the next hour getting into
[1:11:54.840 --> 1:11:57.320]  his view of what's happening in the world
[1:11:57.320 --> 1:12:01.560]  super bugs are intensifying you name it we're going to about the real threats
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:06.200]  going into 2016 and what he expects the globalists to do
[1:12:06.200 --> 1:12:11.240]  it is such good news though that our own military is continuing to say no
[1:12:11.240 --> 1:12:14.360]  cy hirsch reported last week what we told you years ago
[1:12:14.360 --> 1:12:17.880]  the pentagon's been leaking intelligence to the syrians
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:22.200]  and now to the russians the article said that with dimsy leaving as the joint
[1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:26.920]  chiefs of staff chairman that stopped it did not stop
[1:12:26.920 --> 1:12:30.600]  and people were intimidated before by the nsa and being indicted
[1:12:30.600 --> 1:12:34.440]  but what the government's doing is so criminal that top brass and even low
[1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:37.400]  level people are doing things that previously they would have gotten in
[1:12:37.400 --> 1:12:40.760]  trouble for but they don't care if they get in trouble now
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:44.440]  and in that the establishment has run into a dead end
[1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:47.720]  because people aren't intimidated anymore to the same extent because the
[1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:51.480]  military realizes there is no future if they don't say no because they're
[1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:53.640]  getting ready to let isis launch terror attacks
[1:12:53.640 --> 1:12:57.800]  all over the west and then use that to ban the free speech of christians
[1:12:57.800 --> 1:13:01.320]  conservatives libertarians and veterans and they've done it in europe
[1:13:01.320 --> 1:13:06.680]  declaring martial law from italy to germany to france
[1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:09.960]  they call it civil emergency in england where you can't criticize radical
[1:13:09.960 --> 1:13:12.680]  islam you can't criticize communist you can't go out and
[1:13:12.680 --> 1:13:16.200]  demonstrate if you're a christian even the bishop of canterbury who is not a
[1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:19.240]  conservative came out and said christians are being exterminated
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:26.040]  worldwide because it's happening and our normalcy bias is so insane
[1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:29.720]  that we sit here and know it's happening and do nothing
[1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:33.320]  and i understand why what do you do
[1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:38.200]  i've built a media operation that reaches 20 million people a week
[1:13:38.200 --> 1:13:41.080]  steve quill reaches millions a week and writes books and does what he can to get
[1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:44.440]  people thinking outside the box but regardless you've got to start
[1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:48.120]  pulling out of their system and you've got to criticize their system
[1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:51.400]  and when the tsa comes out and says we're going to naked body scan you
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:55.240]  whether you like it or not you sue them and you go out and you demonstrate
[1:13:55.240 --> 1:13:59.160]  and you point out it's not the tsa's fault it's congress doing it
[1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:02.760]  who exempts themselves from the naked body scanners on record but not
[1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:06.760]  citizens and then caught one terrorist because
[1:14:06.760 --> 1:14:09.640]  they leave the borders open and bring them in so they can use the threat to
[1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:12.840]  take our rights and if you put up with naked body scanners in the airports
[1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:17.240]  next it's going to be in the shopping malls which they're calling for
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:21.640]  it's a naked fraud you know i said i'd air this last hour i'll play three minutes
[1:14:21.640 --> 1:14:27.240]  up and then go to steve quill but i appreciate joining us
[1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:32.280]  because it illustrates this film was made in 2007
[1:14:32.280 --> 1:14:36.840]  that's now five six seven eight years ago and you notice the intro to it starts
[1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:40.280]  with a few minutes of music and then has the intro about the near future
[1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:43.880]  compact cities all activity control track trace
[1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:46.680]  this is what they're announcing with the micro apartments this is what they're
[1:14:46.680 --> 1:14:51.400]  announcing with the driverless cars they're announcing the end of
[1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:55.800]  humans being able to control our own destiny a presence being built around
[1:14:55.800 --> 1:14:59.320]  us feudalism where if the king doesn't like it he just shuts the
[1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:03.080]  food off total control
[1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:06.760]  and people think being sycophantic servants of this will protect them
[1:15:06.760 --> 1:15:10.120]  it will ensure your destruction i'm going to skip this one network break
[1:15:10.120 --> 1:15:13.400]  coming up so we get this time back to steve quill but let's go to this
[1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:17.800]  clip from in game that's free online
[1:15:18.440 --> 1:15:21.800]  we should repost it to say you know the film that came true
[1:15:21.800 --> 1:15:26.360]  send it out to folks so they understand that most the film has already come true
[1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:29.560]  now do you want the rest of it to come true folks because where we're being
[1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:34.040]  drugged to is a very horrible place let's go to the
[1:15:34.040 --> 1:15:37.080]  intro to the film
[1:15:38.680 --> 1:15:43.960]  countless people hate the new world order and will die protesting against it
[1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:52.280]  hg wells in his book the new world order 1939
[1:15:52.280 --> 1:15:56.040]  i appeared before the congressional committee to tell what i knew of
[1:15:56.040 --> 1:15:59.560]  activities which might lead to an attempt to set up a fastest
[1:15:59.560 --> 1:16:03.640]  dictatorship the potential for the disastrous rise of
[1:16:03.640 --> 1:16:09.560]  misplaced power exists and will persist the very word secrecy is repugnant
[1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:14.280]  in a free and open society and we are as a people
[1:16:14.280 --> 1:16:18.920]  inherently and historically opposed to secret societies
[1:16:18.920 --> 1:16:23.880]  the secret oaths and a secret proceedings president bush signed a
[1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:27.240]  formal agreement that will end the united states as we know it
[1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:31.320]  and he took the step without approval from either the u.s
[1:16:31.320 --> 1:16:35.960]  the people of the united states the secret organizations of the world power
[1:16:35.960 --> 1:16:40.760]  elite are no longer secret is known as the bilderberg group
[1:16:40.760 --> 1:16:45.000]  could their objective be world domination
[1:16:45.640 --> 1:16:50.600]  i'm jim tucker i've chased bilderberg 30 years
[1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:57.320]  i'll never give up the chase bilderberg plan for the whole world
[1:16:57.320 --> 1:17:01.720]  is nothing less than world government
[1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:06.360]  i'm not comfortable with that at all who elected these guys to run the planet
[1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:10.200]  they are the elitist they feel they should run the world
[1:17:10.200 --> 1:17:17.640]  for their own selfish interests now we can see a new world coming into view
[1:17:17.640 --> 1:17:22.520]  a world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order
[1:17:22.520 --> 1:17:25.400]  bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government
[1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:33.480]  and only an educated informed public can stop them in their tracks
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:38.120]  and he wants to destroy the united states right he's a traitor
[1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:41.320]  it's good to be back at the council on foreign relations as uh
[1:17:41.320 --> 1:17:45.240]  pete mentioned i've been a member for a long time and was actually a
[1:17:45.240 --> 1:17:48.840]  director for some period of time i never mentioned that when i was
[1:17:48.840 --> 1:17:52.200]  campaigning for reelection back home in Wyoming
[1:17:52.200 --> 1:18:02.680]  let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories
[1:18:02.680 --> 1:18:10.600]  i need you to move off the property please some shots were fired
[1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:14.040]  there's bilderberg is right there
[1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:19.960]  the transexual corridor is a vital part because we stop here in texas we stop
[1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:27.640]  the new world order ride here in texas this thing started here
[1:18:27.640 --> 1:18:38.600]  and to save this country we kill this damn thing here
[1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:52.600]  there is a chance for the president of the united states
[1:18:52.600 --> 1:18:58.680]  to carry out a phrase his father used and that is a new world order
[1:18:58.680 --> 1:19:06.840]  your new world order will fall humanity will defeat you the answer to 1984
[1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:16.840]  is 1776
[1:19:28.040 --> 1:19:34.920]  in the near future earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:39.400]  once free nations are slaves to the will of a tiny elite
[1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:43.880]  the dawn of a new dark age is upon mankind
[1:19:43.880 --> 1:19:49.960]  countries are a thing of the past every form of independence is under attack
[1:19:49.960 --> 1:19:55.480]  with the family and even the individual itself nearing extinction
[1:19:55.480 --> 1:20:00.520]  close to 80 of the earth's population has been eliminated
[1:20:00.520 --> 1:20:05.720]  the remnants of a once free humanity are forced to live within highly controlled
[1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:11.960]  compact prison-like cities travel is highly restricted
[1:20:11.960 --> 1:20:16.360]  super highways connect the mega cities and keep the population from entering
[1:20:16.360 --> 1:20:21.960]  into unauthorized zones no human activities private
[1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:26.440]  ai supercomputers chronicle and categorize every action
[1:20:26.440 --> 1:20:30.920]  a prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks
[1:20:30.920 --> 1:20:35.880]  whose power can never be challenged this is the vision of the global elite
[1:20:35.880 --> 1:20:40.360]  their goal a program of total dehumanization
[1:20:40.360 --> 1:20:46.440]  where the science of tyranny is lost a worldwide control grid designed to
[1:20:46.440 --> 1:20:50.120]  ensure the overlords monopoly of power forever
[1:20:50.120 --> 1:20:53.080]  our species will be condemned to this nightmare future
[1:20:53.080 --> 1:20:57.000]  unless the masses are awakened to the new world order master plan
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:00.840]  and mobilized to defeat it
[1:21:01.160 --> 1:21:05.160]  erected by a secretive group the georgia guide stones
[1:21:05.160 --> 1:21:09.240]  are a testament to the elite's plan for a world religion
[1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:13.560]  global laws with a global court and army to enforce it
[1:21:13.560 --> 1:21:17.240]  all right that's like five minutes from my film in game and you watch the film
[1:21:17.240 --> 1:21:20.280]  it's free online that's just from youtube so it wasn't that high a res
[1:21:20.280 --> 1:21:24.200]  we have obviously the dvd and then for store.com and hd
[1:21:24.200 --> 1:21:28.120]  but it's just important to show people so they know what's going to happen to them
[1:21:28.120 --> 1:21:31.320]  and then they may not wake up right away but down the road they'll remember
[1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:35.240]  and people really need to know exactly what they're facing
[1:21:35.240 --> 1:21:38.360]  steve quill joins us about 20 minutes into the next hour

[1:22:04.520 --> 1:22:07.720]  the arrogance to use the terror that they brought in and then take our rights
[1:22:07.720 --> 1:22:11.720]  i mean this is so transparent uh as you know a big push last week by the
[1:22:11.720 --> 1:22:14.120]  smithsonian and the federal government and nasa
[1:22:14.120 --> 1:22:18.520]  admitting that the jet aerosol is from the engines
[1:22:18.520 --> 1:22:22.600]  and from the fuel and is terraforming the planet
[1:22:22.600 --> 1:22:26.280]  admitting kim frills last week uh admitting florides killing people this
[1:22:26.280 --> 1:22:28.840]  week uh i mean these are government announcements
[1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:32.440]  uh just a lot of bizarreness going on good and bad
[1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:37.480]  uh so much happening with the stock markets uh the year nothing works stocks
[1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:40.040]  bonds and cash went nowhere this year that's a
[1:22:40.040 --> 1:22:45.000]  cnbc report uh check president talks about the eu with an organized plan to
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:49.720]  implode the countries i mean it is just an incredible time to be alive right
[1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:53.560]  now and obviously next year most analyst degree is just going to get more
[1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:57.880]  insane uh steve quill to break down the real state of the planet
[1:22:57.880 --> 1:23:02.200]  not just the state of the union joins us steve quill thank you for coming on
[1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:06.600]  well thank you alex and let's just draw everyone's attention to the fact now
[1:23:06.600 --> 1:23:12.520]  the voluminous evidence that the united states is the funding source behind isis
[1:23:12.520 --> 1:23:16.280]  it is the provisioning source behind isis
[1:23:16.280 --> 1:23:20.040]  obviously we've been caught with our hands in the cookie jar of
[1:23:20.040 --> 1:23:25.720]  incredible evil incredible terror and it it's got to strike a court alex and
[1:23:25.720 --> 1:23:29.880]  every americans heart that we are the ones that are funding the most
[1:23:29.880 --> 1:23:35.400]  atrocious acts of inhumanity that have even been uh
[1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:38.600]  described in the annals of the dark ages so
[1:23:38.600 --> 1:23:42.280]  you know i i personally have watched people deny deny deny but
[1:23:42.280 --> 1:23:46.040]  bledimer putin's telling people the truth when he said don't you see what
[1:23:46.040 --> 1:23:50.840]  you've done or see what you've done the idea is simply this is and this is
[1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:55.080]  what i think everyone misses is that with the entity that's in the white house
[1:23:55.080 --> 1:23:59.000]  we now are seeing the full-scale implementation
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:02.840]  and islamic takeover the united states now remember this
[1:24:02.840 --> 1:24:05.800]  and i think it's important alex is you and i have detailed
[1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:09.960]  after world war two and then this is important
[1:24:09.960 --> 1:24:14.200]  uh the nazis dissembled if you will they scattered throughout the world we
[1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:17.080]  brought a whole bunch of them in under operation paperclip
[1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:20.600]  and for the record alex you and i were the first two to talk about marcus wolf
[1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:25.240]  nostazi and and uh prima cop setting up uh the
[1:24:25.240 --> 1:24:29.560]  fema data control banks if you will and then which led to facebook and all the
[1:24:29.560 --> 1:24:34.200]  other self if you will erecting intelligent dossiers
[1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:39.480]  but this is all the revival of nazism and it never left the world you and i've
[1:24:39.480 --> 1:24:43.560]  talked excessively in our early years on talk radio of who banked it who
[1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:47.240]  who the banking families of the united states banking
[1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:52.760]  families of europe even george bush's uh uh of father and grandfather involved
[1:24:52.760 --> 1:24:55.160]  with the nazis but here's the important thing
[1:24:55.160 --> 1:24:58.840]  while of a sudden i don't know have you had time to watch a hunting hitler on the
[1:24:58.840 --> 1:25:02.120]  national geographic channel uh yes and i even
[1:25:02.120 --> 1:25:05.880]  know tim kennedy who's the special forces the individual out there and i'm
[1:25:05.880 --> 1:25:10.520]  not at liberty to say some of the things i was told about the show but
[1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:14.600]  clearly they already knew where i mean tim didn't know but but
[1:25:14.600 --> 1:25:17.800]  bear of the cia and others already knew where they were going what they were
[1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:21.160]  doing because that's been known by the cia since then
[1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:24.200]  because they were the ones that let the nazis go there and that's even been
[1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:30.440]  declassified absolutely now people've got to ask themselves why all of a sudden
[1:25:30.440 --> 1:25:34.360]  with that you know 70 years or 70 plus years of a
[1:25:34.360 --> 1:25:38.520]  total lockout and obviously the fbis files on healer i mean they knew where he
[1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:41.240]  was every step of the way they knew where mengelow was
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:45.240]  they knew where some of the the people that basically don't even
[1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:49.800]  know these names but the germans in their high technology in their
[1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:53.400]  experiments on humanity dr mengelow mengelow's twinning
[1:25:53.400 --> 1:25:58.040]  mengelow's cloning the fact is is that our cia
[1:25:58.040 --> 1:26:01.640]  has been uh from day one under dulls pretty much
[1:26:01.640 --> 1:26:05.400]  uh ellen dollas dlles has been pretty much
[1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:11.400]  if you will a nazi uh import and now we've got the situation going where we
[1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:15.880]  were seeing racial purity and how many times alice have you talked about
[1:26:15.880 --> 1:26:19.080]  everything from margaret sanger planned parenthood
[1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:23.400]  you know uh the whole idea of the nazi society for racial
[1:26:23.400 --> 1:26:28.840]  purity now we're seeing entire groups of people marked for destruction by ices
[1:26:28.840 --> 1:26:32.200]  and and that i promise you whoever is heading up ices
[1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:36.520]  the real heads of it are just laughing in the face and let's expand on that
[1:26:36.520 --> 1:26:39.720]  because eugenics came out of england and the united states
[1:26:39.720 --> 1:26:43.720]  hitler was a creation of that so it was just bringing home people they agreed
[1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:47.480]  with you have to understand all the real eugenicists
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:51.240]  were quote liberals and that's how they sold the idea of
[1:26:51.240 --> 1:26:54.600]  the government's going to take care of you but it's really so they can run your
[1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:58.680]  life and dominate what you do and so the 36 000
[1:26:58.680 --> 1:27:03.160]  nazis brought here on record were used to head up nasa
[1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:06.280]  every major federal agency you name it from behind the scenes
[1:27:06.280 --> 1:27:09.640]  they'd be there 20 30 40 years as the shadow directors
[1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:13.480]  with other directors in front of them because they had so much dirt on them
[1:27:13.480 --> 1:27:16.440]  they fully controlled them and the germans would follow orders they're
[1:27:16.440 --> 1:27:19.640]  well known for that and are very smart and good at organizing
[1:27:19.640 --> 1:27:23.080]  you know that's the cliche but it's certainly true and so from scientific
[1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:27.320]  developments you name it that all came here the shadow government went
[1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:32.200]  underground in 1947 use the nazis as the excuse to keep it all secret because
[1:27:32.200 --> 1:27:35.800]  you couldn't tell the public and so now we have this breakaway
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:39.800]  civilization they've built and more and more they're dribbling out what they've
[1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:42.360]  constructed here's a question why do you think they're
[1:27:42.360 --> 1:27:46.360]  admitting uh okay we ship the nazis out of south america
[1:27:46.360 --> 1:27:50.040]  okay yeah we are spraying you and changing the atmosphere just trust us
[1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:54.360]  it's for your own good uh i mean they're just coming out with more and more
[1:27:54.360 --> 1:27:57.720]  while simultaneously telling people it doesn't exist
[1:27:57.720 --> 1:28:01.720]  well i think the answer to that is the illuminati are flat out satanists
[1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:06.920]  they are flat out luciferian worshipers uh hitler the early years of hitler in
[1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:10.360]  munich uh basically talks about even his words when
[1:28:10.360 --> 1:28:14.520]  the prince of hell entered him everybody's surrounding hitler was in an
[1:28:14.520 --> 1:28:19.000]  occult if you will the higher ups in the ss which by the way stood for black
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:23.160]  son schwarz and so on and forgive my german but the point being by the way
[1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:26.360]  that's all been admitted that was in the british wartime secret reports
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:30.040]  they would get in the ss castle and try to channel the devil
[1:28:30.040 --> 1:28:33.160]  into hitler and they had the the uh black magic
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:36.120]  to that monks there i mean they were whacked out of their minds they would
[1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:39.800]  cut ss officers heads off and try to portend the future looking into their
[1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:41.960]  eyes
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:45.960]  well i think that that the idea of now at breaking
[1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:52.200]  i let me share this if people understood the sophistication of human cloning
[1:28:52.200 --> 1:28:58.440]  and twinning back even in 1946-47 when mangolo was both in argentina brazil
[1:28:58.440 --> 1:29:03.320]  and every place else around the globe if people would study this history you've
[1:29:03.320 --> 1:29:07.080]  got to understand they who control history control the future
[1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:10.840]  and alex in in the book i've just written that it's gone wildfire and this is
[1:29:10.840 --> 1:29:15.400]  critical empire beneath the ice how the nazis one world war two
[1:29:15.400 --> 1:29:20.440]  you cannot prove outside of uh all the empiric evidence that that statement's
[1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:25.240]  not true you just mentioned our did our defense and aerospace industry all of
[1:29:25.240 --> 1:29:29.800]  them bell bell aerospace nasa martin marietta all this
[1:29:29.800 --> 1:29:34.440]  sophisticated top nazis in the world but one of the most famous one was called
[1:29:34.440 --> 1:29:39.160]  on kamala a m m l r tell us about that when you get back into cloning too
[1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:42.920]  because they were cloning rabbits back in the 40s but they suppressed that
[1:29:42.920 --> 1:29:48.200]  they're cloning everything folks again advanced technology stay with us

[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:13.560]  or who just believe in folks that promote the first amendment you know we're to
[1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:17.000]  defend uh the first amendment it's under attack not just the second
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:21.080]  amendment i have news on that as well very serious gun restrictions
[1:34:21.080 --> 1:34:25.560]  uh being attempted through legislation in congress now and at the state level
[1:34:25.560 --> 1:34:28.920]  and also extra judicially by shoeing on manufacturers so
[1:34:28.920 --> 1:34:33.160]  the next big offensive on our guns is here folks the alarm is being
[1:34:33.160 --> 1:34:37.320]  raised but
[1:34:37.320 --> 1:34:40.120]  i noticed i was looking at statistics and i've got wall street journal
[1:34:40.120 --> 1:34:44.040]  articles you name it here government grabs unused gift cards billions of
[1:34:44.040 --> 1:34:48.040]  year unused billions in gift cards go on
[1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:51.560]  spent again wall street journal and i was thinking
[1:34:51.560 --> 1:34:57.320]  why don't we just say 15 off with anybody using a gift card when you go to
[1:34:57.320 --> 1:35:03.960]  info wars store dot com and by the way folks
[1:35:03.960 --> 1:35:08.520]  there's they're all just basically credit cards so it doesn't matter
[1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:12.360]  everyone can get the 15 off that's really what it is this is a store wide
[1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:15.640]  sale for 15 percent and we're going to run it that's on top of
[1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:20.040]  bunch of specials that are running 15 off store wide
[1:35:20.040 --> 1:35:23.640]  but in an attempt to get people to actually
[1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:27.480]  dig through stuff and use that old card before it stops working usually about a
[1:35:27.480 --> 1:35:31.240]  year year and a half they the government just takes the money
[1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:34.840]  legally the companies aren't allowed to do it
[1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:38.120]  why not use those gift cards why not dig through there and then get survival
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:40.920]  shield x2 the good halogen that blocks the bad halogens and has done
[1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:43.160]  so much for my health and you've heard the rave reviews
[1:35:43.160 --> 1:35:46.200]  why not get some super mill vitality why not get some oxy powder and flush out
[1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:50.200]  your intestines why not i mean these are really the
[1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:55.160]  very best products that we could come up with
[1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:59.240]  non-gmo heirloom seeds the widest selection you'll find anywhere
[1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:02.440]  we set out to carry all the major quality brands

[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:35.880]  attention so now there's all these different uh
[1:36:35.880 --> 1:36:40.120]  all these different trump babes and in fact i think you guys can just look it
[1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:43.400]  up uh you know trump babe uh in michigan
[1:36:43.400 --> 1:36:47.560]  wearing the shirt was a great photo of that more and more of that's happening

[1:37:42.600 --> 1:37:47.480]  i cannot thank you enough and then we become a platform to bring everybody on
[1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:50.920]  here from ron paul to matt drudge to donald trump to
[1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:54.760]  steve quail to you name it and to folks that are
[1:37:54.760 --> 1:37:59.400]  successfully suing the tsa and the naked body scanners we're on the march
[1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:02.840]  the globalist technocracy is in a lot of trouble but because it's been able to
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:07.240]  take our tax money globally operate the secret under national security
[1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:10.600]  we don't know how big the monstrosity is and steve quail gets into some pretty
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:13.880]  wild stuff but i remember him talking about cloning 20
[1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:17.320]  years ago and i had bbc articles that were saying
[1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:21.640]  oh we've cloned humans but we kill them in euro
[1:38:21.640 --> 1:38:26.120]  in the in the uterus in utero and then i remember reading articles
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:30.600]  in like 1998 about human clones in the utero
[1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:35.080]  of cows but they changed the human genetics one percent or two percent with
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:39.480]  chimpanzee or cow or pig usually cow or pig because then it
[1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:42.520]  doesn't get rejected they grow them in pigs as well humans
[1:38:42.520 --> 1:38:46.840]  is there a debate about do they have rights where is the no clone testing on
[1:38:46.840 --> 1:38:50.360]  your bottles of drugs or whatever see there's not even debate about it while
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:52.920]  we're worried about puppy dogs and stuff being
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:57.960]  tested on which i'm against as well or or guinea pigs
[1:38:57.960 --> 1:39:02.360]  there's not even a discussion about from costa rica
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:07.720]  to hong kong to to to beijing china these are some of the worst places
[1:39:07.720 --> 1:39:13.400]  massive human cloning going on and they just call it embryonic stem cells
[1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:16.200]  just like we told you 20 years ago they're selling baby parts at plant
[1:39:16.200 --> 1:39:18.520]  parent and the word was sometimes keeping the
[1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:23.000]  partial births alive longer so they could be dissected that's now coming out
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:26.600]  at some of the abortuaries you see how you couldn't believe it but we were
[1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:30.200]  right i told folks five years ago that they were
[1:39:30.200 --> 1:39:33.320]  actually heating hospitals in england as i was told by an insider
[1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:36.360]  with baby parts now it came out in the news two years ago
[1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:39.080]  you cannot make this stuff up and i think that's
[1:39:39.080 --> 1:39:45.000]  one problem we have is that the the admitted fantastical stuff
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:48.120]  like humans that have been genetically changed they quote don't have rights and
[1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:50.840]  don't get rejected that are then grown in not artificial
[1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:56.040]  uteruses but in large mammal uteruses this is what we know is going on
[1:39:56.040 --> 1:40:00.360]  thousands of pharmaceutical crops with live viruses in them
[1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:04.360]  merging with plants and animals uh franken fish being put in the ocean i
[1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:08.680]  mean it's it's so incredible it's unbelievable
[1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:12.440]  but no one will get upset about it no one cares about the admissions but we'll
[1:40:12.440 --> 1:40:16.120]  freak out all day if somebody saw a chubacabra in their backyard
[1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:19.960]  with no proof and so i don't understand that paradox where
[1:40:19.960 --> 1:40:23.400]  steve quill i'm not knocking folks talk about chubacabra as the point is
[1:40:23.400 --> 1:40:26.280]  we have real spider goats going on for 30 years
[1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:30.040]  i didn't know about it until 20 years ago we have real glow-in-the-dark cats and
[1:40:30.040 --> 1:40:33.400]  dogs you can buy in asia they won't allow it here because they don't want
[1:40:33.400 --> 1:40:36.520]  the public to freak out you know they're part jellyfish
[1:40:36.520 --> 1:40:40.120]  and if anyone's just hearing this i know it sounds insane but it's real so
[1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:43.320]  steve quill what is this paradox where
[1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:46.920]  they admit the emergency centers establishment act with the fema camps
[1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:50.120]  army dot mill says they're preparing to re-educate americans in them for our
[1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:53.160]  political beliefs how they're going to break our families up but i can't get
[1:40:53.160 --> 1:40:56.840]  anybody to go to the document but they'll they'll
[1:40:56.840 --> 1:41:00.360]  some guy shows a train station and says he thinks it's one and it gets five
[1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:03.640]  million views when it's not so then glenn bet can say we're making
[1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:06.520]  stuff up and show a train station that we didn't say
[1:41:06.520 --> 1:41:09.800]  was a fema camp but say we said it's a fema camp so that's why i try to be
[1:41:09.800 --> 1:41:11.960]  careful and only report on what we can prove
[1:41:11.960 --> 1:41:16.040]  i know the rabbit hole goes a trillion miles deeper but but how do you deal
[1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:20.120]  with this paradox well first of all you've got to understand
[1:41:20.120 --> 1:41:23.320]  that i believe that we are the most mind controlled
[1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:27.880]  population in the world i get into that alex and in realms i never even touched
[1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:30.280]  in in my new book empire beneath the ice
[1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:34.280]  it's fine and let me just share this we're talking about this peter good game
[1:41:34.280 --> 1:41:38.920]  made it a powerful statement and a lot of people are asking why all this
[1:41:38.920 --> 1:41:41.800]  hitler stuff and this will answer your question
[1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:45.080]  and i'm going to quote good game one quick paragraph the answer to what drove
[1:41:45.080 --> 1:41:48.280]  hitler can be found by examining hitler's relationship with the occult his
[1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:52.680]  involvement with dark arts of sorcery and demon of spirit possession
[1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:57.240]  and then revelation 17 eight says the beast that thou saw us was and is not
[1:41:57.240 --> 1:42:00.520]  in and shall ascend out the bottom of spit and go forth into
[1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:03.720]  perdition and they that dwell in the air shall wonder whose names are not
[1:42:03.720 --> 1:42:07.080]  written in the book of life from the foundations of the world
[1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:10.440]  cloning has been so sophisticated one of the things that
[1:42:10.440 --> 1:42:14.360]  got me in a lot of trouble years ago and and if it wouldn't been for some brave
[1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:18.200]  guys in austin god bless you those people in us know i'm talking about
[1:42:18.200 --> 1:42:22.200]  would have led to an event where i would no longer be on alex
[1:42:22.200 --> 1:42:27.560]  shown as my show or anybody show the advance cloning alex i prove you know
[1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:32.280]  this i put note everything i prove it but i can't overcome nor can you
[1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:38.280]  overcome or we overcome the denial of uncomfortability okay
[1:42:38.280 --> 1:42:42.760]  the people want you to be the tip of the spear
[1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:47.400]  want me to be the tip of the spear the bow and of the ice breaker you know
[1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:52.600]  and and guess what if the bow on the ice breaker doesn't hit the ice first mean
[1:42:52.600 --> 1:42:55.880]  that which stands against it the rest of the ship
[1:42:55.880 --> 1:42:58.920]  you know won't be able to make it through the ice
[1:42:58.920 --> 1:43:02.440]  so we're living in a world of supernatural
[1:43:02.440 --> 1:43:05.880]  demonic and and and i believe a fallen angel
[1:43:05.880 --> 1:43:10.280]  infestation okay remember this everybody you and i quote in the new world
[1:43:10.280 --> 1:43:14.440]  order the globalist all these guys are luciferians
[1:43:14.440 --> 1:43:20.440]  to them lucifer is more real than jesus christ is to the christians okay
[1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:24.040]  now i'm not saying that's the case i'm saying they take
[1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:29.560]  their luciferianism to the nth degree and talking about baby parts okay
[1:43:29.560 --> 1:43:34.680]  this is the ladies and gentlemen the noxies are the ones who provided
[1:43:34.680 --> 1:43:39.640]  margaret sanger with her intellectual quasi uh
[1:43:39.640 --> 1:43:45.080]  supernatural evil if if the devil's goals destroy mankind alex and i believe
[1:43:45.080 --> 1:43:48.760]  that's what you believe and they had to i agree they had to betray hitler this is
[1:43:48.760 --> 1:43:51.560]  all on record literally folks if you look into it
[1:43:51.560 --> 1:43:55.480]  he had to play the bad cop so america england others can play the good cop
[1:43:55.480 --> 1:44:00.360]  with the soft eugenics under the table so that people wouldn't see
[1:44:00.360 --> 1:44:04.520]  that hitler was actually just one expression to be defeated
[1:44:04.520 --> 1:44:08.840]  so then their system could come into full power with a global government
[1:44:08.840 --> 1:44:13.080]  based on uh the agreements that were made after world war two for the dollar
[1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:17.240]  to be the world reserve currency well that's true but remember that
[1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:21.880]  that the in the last days when the antichrist does show up on the scene
[1:44:21.880 --> 1:44:26.200]  it says that the kings of the earth will give their power unto him right
[1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:29.080]  they'll fall down and worship them and what this this is something i've got to
[1:44:29.080 --> 1:44:31.960]  say the entity in the slaughterhouse those are my
[1:44:31.960 --> 1:44:37.880]  words for the current american policy uh we're seeing now the fulfillment or
[1:44:37.880 --> 1:44:44.120]  forgive me the inception if it is the lomic uh and and the the if you will
[1:44:44.120 --> 1:44:48.920]  the return of the maddie and that he can only return after world war three
[1:44:48.920 --> 1:44:53.160]  the you know alex people used to say to me you're crazy well
[1:44:53.160 --> 1:44:56.280]  there's not going to be a nuclear war while everybody would get us destroyed
[1:44:56.280 --> 1:44:59.800]  meanwhile china moves into syria rushes there
[1:44:59.800 --> 1:45:04.200]  uh we're doing nato just moved into say wax planes which is a direct
[1:45:04.200 --> 1:45:08.520]  challenge of vladimir putin putin is given i believe every chance for america
[1:45:08.520 --> 1:45:13.640]  to step away but it's there's an unseen hand alex and it is the devil it's
[1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:18.280]  luciferianism and no matter who you quote i quote we can take them in
[1:45:18.280 --> 1:45:21.720]  concept how many times over the years you've been on talk radio you quoted
[1:45:21.720 --> 1:45:26.120]  all the population control quotes from everything from kuzo
[1:45:26.120 --> 1:45:29.240]  the prince philip you name it everybody yet people
[1:45:29.240 --> 1:45:33.400]  don't want to admit it now we see the geoengineering remember how much flock
[1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:38.280]  i caught when i first broke that story uh i and for the record i'm not taking
[1:45:38.280 --> 1:45:41.400]  no it's true you you you're the first person i remember
[1:45:41.400 --> 1:45:44.680]  breaking that there was atmospheric weather manipulation going on with
[1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:47.960]  things being added to the fuel to be dispersed by the engines you dug out
[1:45:47.960 --> 1:45:51.400]  the patents all of it's absolutely you and then
[1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:54.760]  also dr nick baggage where the i think he came after you
[1:45:54.760 --> 1:45:59.560]  right angels don't play this harp and and the situation is is that now
[1:45:59.560 --> 1:46:03.480]  we've got nazi technology but here's what i want people understand
[1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:07.560]  dr mangala's driving force was to keep the
[1:46:07.560 --> 1:46:12.040]  seed of the fewer going there's a little town in brazil that has i think
[1:46:12.040 --> 1:46:17.400]  10 percent of its population uh six to seven hundred sets of twins claudio
[1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:22.200]  corday or cardo c o d i t on i don't speak spanish so i apologize for
[1:46:22.200 --> 1:46:25.960]  slaughtering that but the point being is is that twinning
[1:46:25.960 --> 1:46:31.000]  was was kindergarten alex i've talked to people i'm sure you have to
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:35.480]  and and now when every news story on mat mad dredge site you know
[1:46:35.480 --> 1:46:39.800]  the point is is that cloning is so far advanced in gene editing and the
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:44.440]  super soldiers everything now is coming into play and i said to people i so
[1:46:44.440 --> 1:46:49.080]  when this stuff begins to be uh implemented on a global scale it
[1:46:49.080 --> 1:46:52.280]  will come from your left side your right side will come from underneath you
[1:46:52.280 --> 1:46:56.440]  will come from behind you and is it's basically their idea
[1:46:56.440 --> 1:47:00.600]  same strategy cloud piven is to overwhelm
[1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:05.240]  the system and overwhelm the census and i believe that america
[1:47:05.240 --> 1:47:08.520]  even more so than any country has been numbed and dumbed down
[1:47:08.520 --> 1:47:11.720]  and look you know people want to look at sports fine
[1:47:11.720 --> 1:47:17.160]  but entertainment has nourished and blinded the thinking process of most
[1:47:17.160 --> 1:47:21.400]  americans now the mba is on an anti-gun rant and i want to say this
[1:47:21.400 --> 1:47:25.480]  i'm on record as stating anybody who will take your guns away
[1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:30.360]  is your executioner they can't give me any bs they can try anybody promoting
[1:47:30.360 --> 1:47:34.200]  gun control especially organized media is a conscious enemy of you and your
[1:47:34.200 --> 1:47:37.560]  family who literally wants to break you and destroy you
[1:47:37.560 --> 1:47:40.680]  now remember that when you still watch the nba or the nfl
[1:47:40.680 --> 1:47:44.600]  remember that when you're not actively out opening
[1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:48.360]  dialogues with people exposing that these people are our enemies
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:53.720]  absolutely and again okay you know hey people forget who who really
[1:47:53.720 --> 1:47:57.960]  went to work on propaganda you know look let's look at it realistically
[1:47:57.960 --> 1:48:01.960]  by the way i put up a story yesterday on my website angela merkel and
[1:48:01.960 --> 1:48:04.840]  that she was the head of the stasi she denied it
[1:48:04.840 --> 1:48:10.040]  but cnn backed it up with all their stasi meaning east german secret police
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:15.000]  ask yourself why would she as the uh... if you will
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:20.120]  the the head of germany allow the total destruction of germany well it's
[1:48:20.120 --> 1:48:24.280]  because the illuminati has a one uh... here's the thing alex they don't get
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:28.840]  the people don't get is it's order add chaos that you're seeing
[1:48:28.840 --> 1:48:32.680]  the global chaos now to bring about the new world order
[1:48:32.680 --> 1:48:36.200]  i am absolutely i mean look they can make cats
[1:48:36.200 --> 1:48:39.240]  that are part spider they can make goats that are part spider
[1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:43.160]  for twenty years that you could buy in hong kong glow in the dark monkeys
[1:48:43.160 --> 1:48:46.600]  i mean i'm showing people mainstream news articles right now that this is not a
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:49.320]  joke and i always see comments on informers going
[1:48:49.320 --> 1:48:53.400]  he was talking about glowing cats again today they won't even go research it
[1:48:53.400 --> 1:48:58.040]  it's mainstream news this is what's going on
[1:48:58.040 --> 1:49:02.360]  absolutely and here's the thing you know it when there's a department of
[1:49:02.360 --> 1:49:05.880]  propaganda in the military most of those people that'll take you on
[1:49:05.880 --> 1:49:10.280]  on on or me on and all the different i hate alex i hate steve i hate this i
[1:49:10.280 --> 1:49:13.640]  hate that form people who are on those forms of god
[1:49:13.640 --> 1:49:18.040]  ask themselves what have these people done to inform look your record stands
[1:49:18.040 --> 1:49:20.440]  for what it is my record stands for what it is
[1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:23.640]  they can they can complain they can moan they can
[1:49:23.640 --> 1:49:26.920]  destroy our our uh... you know reputations try
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:30.760]  they can do all these things but they can't account for being wrong for the
[1:49:30.760 --> 1:49:35.240]  last twenty years can they they can now they want to change the subject onto us
[1:49:35.240 --> 1:49:38.200]  and i mean look at this you speak of the islamic invasion i would hear you on
[1:49:38.200 --> 1:49:41.560]  this and a lot of others a decade ago and go they're not really going to use the
[1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:43.560]  muslims the radical muslims to take over
[1:49:43.560 --> 1:49:46.520]  i know they would have a class of civilizations they admitted that but i
[1:49:46.520 --> 1:49:50.360]  mean here it is organized europe advertisers come in they actually bring
[1:49:50.360 --> 1:49:54.040]  in the sunni refugees that are the jihadist they know they're going to
[1:49:54.040 --> 1:49:57.320]  attack common sense is suspended
[1:49:57.320 --> 1:50:01.480]  steve and when they do attack us they announced that citizens are going to lose
[1:50:01.480 --> 1:50:04.840]  their rights it turns out the fb i was blocked from going after the san
[1:50:04.840 --> 1:50:09.720]  bernadino people i mean they really are going to bring in these proxy armies
[1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:13.880]  how bad is the islamic invasion going to get of europe what's the end game there
[1:50:13.880 --> 1:50:18.120]  well the end game is the complete dissolution of europe
[1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:22.200]  for i don't know a brief time period and then you're going to see total war
[1:50:22.200 --> 1:50:25.160]  against the muslims you probably saw poland said we'll raise an army of a
[1:50:25.160 --> 1:50:29.400]  hundred and fifty thousand i clap and salute the president hungary said not
[1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:32.920]  here the president of the check republic said not here and it's
[1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:37.400]  fascinating isn't it alex alex that the idea of those very same
[1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:41.160]  people that withstood the muslim invasion of europe are
[1:50:41.160 --> 1:50:45.080]  withstanding them now meanwhile we just got the news today you probably saw it
[1:50:45.080 --> 1:50:48.280]  that in those 70 year old declassified records it shows that the french
[1:50:48.280 --> 1:50:52.360]  government the vc government was working with the nazis to exterminate the
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:55.640]  jews i don't know if you saw that story yet oh absolutely that's how they took
[1:50:55.640 --> 1:50:58.040]  over france france didn't even fight the germans

[1:54:09.080 --> 1:54:13.160]  simon frank ray mike chris and others by the way
[1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:17.240]  last week i started telling a story on air a true story that i've never really
[1:54:17.240 --> 1:54:20.520]  gotten into and then a video was put out about it
[1:54:20.520 --> 1:54:24.760]  and it went viral i'll put that on tv screen for tv viewers for radio listeners
[1:54:24.760 --> 1:54:28.680]  i will give you the headline assassin brought in to kill
[1:54:28.680 --> 1:54:33.320]  alex jones dies in police shootout uh that was the headline whoever gave the
[1:54:33.320 --> 1:54:37.560]  headlines that day came up with um the reason i think of this is steve
[1:54:37.560 --> 1:54:41.080]  quill talked about a case where some special forces people found out about a
[1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:44.760]  plan to kill him about a decade ago and it got stopped
[1:54:44.760 --> 1:54:47.880]  at a public event that's why quill hasn't really been in public or been seen
[1:54:47.880 --> 1:54:52.440]  since then here's what i want to tell you
[1:54:52.440 --> 1:54:55.640]  since i mentioned this i am going to get all the documents together and do a
[1:54:55.640 --> 1:55:00.280]  short piece on it but it's not the kind of thing
[1:55:00.280 --> 1:55:03.400]  that you want to give attention to i mean it's really weird when you're
[1:55:03.400 --> 1:55:08.680]  actually talking about yourself um but i love the trolls on there you know
[1:55:08.680 --> 1:55:12.280]  saying oh that's not true uh you know none of this
[1:55:12.280 --> 1:55:15.640]  happened it's like the time the fbi came here about the obama deception
[1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:19.720]  and was asking about the obama deception and then a year later in a trial it
[1:55:19.720 --> 1:55:23.880]  actually came up it was sealed via a subpoena i couldn't tell you why they
[1:55:23.880 --> 1:55:27.400]  were here and then oh it was true wasn't it
[1:55:27.400 --> 1:55:30.520]  well a couple years ago the awesome police chief was
[1:55:30.520 --> 1:55:33.960]  here to discuss a bunch of issues on air
[1:55:33.960 --> 1:55:37.560]  and he said hey you know you know we basically stopped some guy coming to
[1:55:37.560 --> 1:55:40.840]  kill you two weeks ago
[1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:43.480]  he goes i was too busy to come on but once this happened you were asking me on
[1:55:43.480 --> 1:55:45.960]  i came on to tell you and he goes you really don't know about this he goes
[1:55:45.960 --> 1:55:48.920]  well i can't talk about it but you'll know soon
[1:55:48.920 --> 1:55:54.200]  and the guy that came here reportedly do this last name was cheney and
[1:55:54.200 --> 1:55:57.240]  they've got the files there i was just looking at them during the break
[1:55:57.240 --> 1:56:00.760]  and then he came here they caught him they couldn't keep him in jail they
[1:56:00.760 --> 1:56:03.880]  you know they they ran him out of town
[1:56:03.880 --> 1:56:06.920]  and then the police in california went after him and he died in a
[1:56:06.920 --> 1:56:10.680]  firefight with them and house got burned down i mean this was in the news in
[1:56:10.680 --> 1:56:14.600]  california i was sent this by detectives there
[1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:19.080]  and so okay i'll do a piece on it but notice the trolls will say that's a lie
[1:56:19.080 --> 1:56:22.680]  because that's what their job is and people are like why haven't we heard about
[1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:27.160]  this before well because if you haven't experienced this
[1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:30.840]  like my cousin just retired out of the army but the other
[1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:34.680]  they were getting stuff from like cartels in their mailboxes
[1:56:34.680 --> 1:56:38.280]  saying where they lived and what their family was doing until you've experienced
[1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:41.960]  this stuff you sit there in your basement says your little man
[1:56:41.960 --> 1:56:45.720]  and then you point at people in the arena and you tell us what's true and
[1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:48.920]  what isn't oh that couldn't be happening because until you've
[1:56:48.920 --> 1:56:52.440]  experienced all this
[1:56:52.600 --> 1:56:56.520]  you just don't know how real it is and i'll go back
[1:56:56.520 --> 1:57:00.920]  i wasn't telling the story in a kind of half-baked way because i just barely
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:05.400]  went over it because i was talking about the fact that
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:11.000]  the police were looking out for me and they weren't using illegal data
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:13.240]  they were using social network scrubbing systems
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:16.600]  to see what people are saying so it's a weird paradox where the kind of spy
[1:57:16.600 --> 1:57:20.440]  system probably saved my life and i got a cop killed
[1:57:20.440 --> 1:57:24.600]  and then i was just saying it's weird like oh the police one
[1:57:24.600 --> 1:57:28.760]  it's it's it's it's an interesting paradox and so quail talked about that
[1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:30.760]  and it made me think of we're going to break in a minute and a half
[1:57:30.760 --> 1:57:34.200]  steve i'm sorry i'm ranting so much today it's just that
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:38.120]  people don't know how real the stuff is go ahead
[1:57:38.120 --> 1:57:41.960]  well alex again i thank god for everyone that prays for your safety
[1:57:41.960 --> 1:57:46.280]  prays for my safety my family's safety but you know ladies and gentlemen there's
[1:57:46.280 --> 1:57:48.920]  a whole group i had a lieutenant colonel in my
[1:57:48.920 --> 1:57:54.840]  office from nor and norad uh you know and he was basically telling me with
[1:57:54.840 --> 1:57:58.680]  tears in his eyes i knew him his father was a former
[1:57:58.680 --> 1:58:02.760]  uh business associate of mine 20 years ago we did film stuff together
[1:58:02.760 --> 1:58:06.920]  and with tears in his eyes he said steve we're going to do everything we can
[1:58:06.920 --> 1:58:11.080]  to destroy you guys on talk radio we'll destroy you we'll put in
[1:58:11.080 --> 1:58:14.680]  you windows out there he said i can't take it he said i'm a christian
[1:58:14.680 --> 1:58:19.000]  so alex i thank god for uh the intercept of that and look
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:22.680]  there are people that tell you stuff and i'll say things
[1:58:22.680 --> 1:58:26.040]  like well a certain uh general and special forces told me i don't believe
[1:58:26.040 --> 1:58:28.760]  it quail won't tell his name while he makes his crap up
[1:58:28.760 --> 1:58:31.800]  you know and sure enough stuff will happen just like i've been told
[1:58:31.800 --> 1:58:35.320]  can i tell you something we're there alex let me make the bottom line
[1:58:35.320 --> 1:58:38.760]  stay there come back to the bottom line 70 seconds one right to you steve

[1:59:01.880 --> 1:59:07.160]  worldwide but our college kids raised in a narrative of white privilege and
[1:59:07.160 --> 1:59:10.920]  microaggression think it's an offense to people of color
[1:59:10.920 --> 1:59:14.120]  it's insulting to people of color perpetuates the idea that white is
[1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:18.280]  naturally good and that other colors are bad and we feel that that's uh
[1:59:18.280 --> 1:59:21.800]  that's a microaggression here's a clue boys and girls
[1:59:21.800 --> 1:59:27.480]  it's about snow snow snow the government educational establishment
[1:59:27.480 --> 1:59:32.200]  is destroying any connection to existing culture so that they can create a new
[1:59:32.200 --> 1:59:37.880]  political culture one of censorship and intolerance done in the name of tolerance
[1:59:37.880 --> 1:59:40.920]  fight back give the gift of knowledge send your

[1:59:48.600 --> 2:00:00.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:10.200 --> 2:00:18.120]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones
[2:00:18.120 --> 2:00:25.800]  show steve quayle your calls are coming up here just a moment but steve quayle
[2:00:25.800 --> 2:00:30.600]  was about to get to what he said was the bottom line steve quayle
[2:00:30.600 --> 2:00:36.680]  well alex oops yes go ahead steve oh i'm sorry you know if the music was still
[2:00:36.680 --> 2:00:39.560]  playing on fire is on or not bottom line is everything that you and i've
[2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:44.120]  warned about and others have warned about is in play now it's no longer a
[2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:48.360]  matter of conjecture it's no matter of being able to say well
[2:00:48.360 --> 2:00:51.960]  you're gonna you're gonna see this stuff it's all playing out by the way as
[2:00:51.960 --> 2:00:55.000]  we're on the radio today and it's what the 28th of
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:59.640]  december erdogan has just been declared you're gonna love this
[2:00:59.640 --> 2:01:03.640]  the head of the islamic world i don't know who declared him that but it's
[2:01:03.640 --> 2:01:06.840]  being carried in the news and it's pretty it's
[2:01:06.840 --> 2:01:11.240]  astonishing for that to have happened because that means
[2:01:11.240 --> 2:01:15.640]  that and i think this i think uh... for president putin's incredibly
[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:19.560]  ahead of the curve he knows he's going to have a problem
[2:01:19.560 --> 2:01:24.200]  with the total islamic invasion of even russia because russia is bordered by
[2:01:24.200 --> 2:01:28.360]  what eight breakaway republics or what were breakaway republics that are
[2:01:28.360 --> 2:01:32.120]  still very strongly muslim oriented so the fact
[2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:36.040]  that that's happening while you and i are near what more has to happen alex
[2:01:36.040 --> 2:01:39.880]  seriously what more has to happen and by the way i went on record 20 years ago
[2:01:39.880 --> 2:01:44.600]  as human beings are completely cloned and i even proposed the
[2:01:44.600 --> 2:01:48.600]  uh... thought what happens if everybody that goes along
[2:01:48.600 --> 2:01:53.000]  with the global mandate has already been replaced in other words what happens
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:56.520]  because i don't believe without advance yet hey the chinese know it
[2:01:56.520 --> 2:02:00.600]  everybody i've talked to knows it the actual i mean the original
[2:02:00.600 --> 2:02:04.280]  you alex jones will be the actual i see well be the actual
[2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:08.200]  but the ones who they would do that would basically have our mannerisms our
[2:02:08.200 --> 2:02:12.200]  character systems and our downloads of what makes us us
[2:02:12.200 --> 2:02:15.800]  the bottom line is outside of the spirit that god gave us
[2:02:15.800 --> 2:02:21.480]  those they would be almost unknowable so the point is that if you listen to all
[2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:25.720]  the elites in their own admissions from rake herswell to you name it
[2:02:25.720 --> 2:02:28.520]  they say we're going to have new clown bodies
[2:02:28.520 --> 2:02:31.880]  and we're going to be superman and nobody else is going to get to have this
[2:02:31.880 --> 2:02:35.240]  there's a genetic arms race to obtain this
[2:02:35.240 --> 2:02:38.360]  and so much of its secret who knows what they've really got i mean
[2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:41.560]  20 years ago the communist chinese were cloning cows
[2:02:41.560 --> 2:02:45.720]  that were part human to create uh... you know human milk
[2:02:45.720 --> 2:02:49.400]  i mean it's all it's on the market for a decade in china at least
[2:02:49.400 --> 2:02:52.360]  i tell the average person in the street that they laugh at me
[2:02:52.360 --> 2:02:56.280]  oh there's a cow that's part human oh they won't
[2:02:56.280 --> 2:03:00.840]  even google it steve i know well here's the thing i'm praying as your
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:04.600]  audience increases and my audience increases while we still have breath
[2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:08.600]  and the protection of almighty god which i i think the lord for them i do think
[2:03:08.600 --> 2:03:12.760]  the lord that if you did the attempt on your life was unsuccessful but alex
[2:03:12.760 --> 2:03:16.200]  listen every day as the end that as a
[2:03:16.200 --> 2:03:21.320]  how do i say this as things speed up and it comes at us from all directions
[2:03:21.320 --> 2:03:25.000]  people have got to understand something that when they go for the guns they're
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:28.600]  going for the guns it will be a blitzkrieg there you go for a german
[2:03:28.600 --> 2:03:32.200]  word and and i can't believe that they got 200
[2:03:32.200 --> 2:03:36.200]  300 million gun owner or guns in america yeah but you're not
[2:03:36.200 --> 2:03:39.480]  uh... how do i say this most people that are
[2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:45.160]  hunters don't know how to take on a delta team if you will or spetsnaz or the
[2:03:45.160 --> 2:03:47.880]  chinese it's going to be beyond that they're going
[2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:50.600]  to have a patriot shoot up a school or something
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:53.800]  and it's gonna be so embarrassing that you're going to be blamed with that if
[2:03:53.800 --> 2:03:57.480]  you don't submit and turn in the semi-auto they admit their plan
[2:03:57.480 --> 2:04:01.400]  once people agree to one group being banned then they will start banning
[2:04:01.400 --> 2:04:05.480]  monthly everything after that right and i and people got to get it together
[2:04:05.480 --> 2:04:09.560]  this isn't about taking away your guns they plan to blow the gun owners away
[2:04:09.560 --> 2:04:13.240]  a specific canadian general was heard on a on a
[2:04:13.240 --> 2:04:16.600]  recorded message i think hawk was on the broadcast that
[2:04:16.600 --> 2:04:20.440]  and i know he was the deal is he basically here's what the general said
[2:04:20.440 --> 2:04:23.480]  paraphrase but it wasn't a tough statement to remember
[2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:27.560]  the americans don't understand when they go into the camps they don't come out
[2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:31.160]  and all of their stuff becomes a spoils of war
[2:04:31.160 --> 2:04:35.320]  you know the old statement you never find a u-haul trailer behind a hearse
[2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:39.480]  but i think you do intellectually in america somehow people think well if i
[2:04:39.480 --> 2:04:42.600]  just give them my semi-automatic then i can go back and watch
[2:04:42.600 --> 2:04:45.720]  no they want the gun because they want your kids
[2:04:45.720 --> 2:04:49.000]  they want you they want it all they want to sit there
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:52.520]  with the little socialist and all these professors and people literally running
[2:04:52.520 --> 2:04:55.400]  camps kicking our guts down all were chained down

[2:08:24.680 --> 2:08:29.320]  notification of america want to be clear it doesn't mean go after the quote minorities
[2:08:29.320 --> 2:08:34.040]  it means a system of social control eugenicists are on record saying we're
[2:08:34.040 --> 2:08:37.240]  not going to go against certain races or people we're going to go against
[2:08:37.240 --> 2:08:43.320]  basically everybody and it's a science of social control i want to go to simon
[2:08:43.320 --> 2:08:47.720]  frank ray mike chris and others we're going to have our guests at the bottom
[2:08:47.720 --> 2:08:51.000]  of the hour they don't get into a bunch of special reports other key intel we have
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:55.080]  not yet covered but steve i've got to ask you this question briefly and then
[2:08:55.080 --> 2:08:58.920]  go to these calls matt drudge was here a few months ago
[2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:03.320]  but i've talked to a lot of other people in media uh syndicated talk radio
[2:09:03.320 --> 2:09:09.880]  big local talk radio you name it um for people that don't know most of even your
[2:09:09.880 --> 2:09:15.400]  smaller radio change and tv change are financed or controlled one way or
[2:09:15.400 --> 2:09:21.560]  another by jp morgan by wells fargo berkshire hathaway
[2:09:21.560 --> 2:09:26.200]  um the big one of course is goldman sacks
[2:09:26.200 --> 2:09:30.360]  they're involved in everything and i was taken off xm last year
[2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:33.720]  very successful on there after being on like seven years
[2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:40.600]  i was taken off a lot of medium-sized company radio stations and they'd say
[2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:44.200]  nope no problem you have the ratings no problem people love you in fact we've
[2:09:44.200 --> 2:09:47.160]  had you on here for years will you please just not attack us when we take you
[2:09:47.160 --> 2:09:51.880]  off we'll be honest with you it is a corporate decision
[2:09:51.880 --> 2:09:58.360]  and that's what's going on and they're getting rid of uh locals who are on the
[2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:02.760]  radio conservative morning host and people and i've talked to these folks
[2:10:02.760 --> 2:10:07.560]  it's not to bring in newer cheaper people they are putting liberals on they're
[2:10:07.560 --> 2:10:11.400]  putting on fake pseudo conservatives so here's how the teams work
[2:10:11.400 --> 2:10:15.800]  and we're going to your calls you'll have one guy who's a pseudo
[2:10:15.800 --> 2:10:19.720]  conservative but kind of loses the arguments then you'll have the quote
[2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:23.320]  liberal and that's who they're putting on
[2:10:23.320 --> 2:10:27.800]  everywhere and they even tell people can you do this new format
[2:10:27.800 --> 2:10:30.520]  this is what the consultants say and what it means is you do what the
[2:10:30.520 --> 2:10:33.240]  consultant says not because you're going to make money or because it's going to
[2:10:33.240 --> 2:10:36.200]  be successful you do what the corporate consultant
[2:10:36.200 --> 2:10:41.240]  says because then the ad agency will give you money
[2:10:41.240 --> 2:10:47.160]  so steve quayle there is a purge of libertarian patriot media they're coming
[2:10:47.160 --> 2:10:51.000]  after the internet as well because we're exploding because we are hurting them
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:54.600]  they can't have this criminal takeover and have the tpp rule america outside of
[2:10:54.600 --> 2:10:59.160]  law and do forced inoculations if we're on the air but don't they get
[2:10:59.160 --> 2:11:03.320]  that the transmission already went out to the police and military and others
[2:11:03.320 --> 2:11:07.240]  and that and that people now know don't they get that we didn't just sit here
[2:11:07.240 --> 2:11:10.840]  flat footed the last 20 something years yourself and count with others
[2:11:10.840 --> 2:11:13.960]  and that we now are in a fighting position don't they understand that
[2:11:13.960 --> 2:11:17.720]  steve quayle i think they're blinded by their rage
[2:11:17.720 --> 2:11:21.160]  and the lies they believe the luciferian lies
[2:11:21.160 --> 2:11:26.200]  uh valhalla if you will without any uh reference to god it's a spiritual
[2:11:26.200 --> 2:11:29.160]  battle alex but it takes place in the physical realm
[2:11:29.160 --> 2:11:34.360]  i think the problem is is that the professing christian church has become
[2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:39.080]  the weakest expression of that which the men of faith the men you and i quote the
[2:11:39.080 --> 2:11:43.080]  men you and i read in the bible laid down their lives were and
[2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:47.080]  detrick bonhoeffer with stood the nazis i mean let's face it
[2:11:47.080 --> 2:11:50.680]  there are very few bonhoeffers in this world there's a whole lot of
[2:11:50.680 --> 2:11:55.080]  kiss or embrace the enemies we're in people because everybody with g
[2:11:55.080 --> 2:11:58.040]  sub friendship with the world is enmity with god okay
[2:11:58.040 --> 2:12:01.720]  but people will choose political correctness
[2:12:01.720 --> 2:12:06.440]  as long as nobody messes with their big screen tv
[2:12:06.440 --> 2:12:11.400]  or whatever it is so basically i call it narcosynthesis narcosynthesis has
[2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:14.520]  another meaning but here's how i define narcosynthesis
[2:12:14.520 --> 2:12:18.520]  when you know what's his name was it lennon who said the religion's the opiate
[2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:21.800]  of the masses television is the opiate of the masses
[2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:26.280]  martin mcluen was right it's not the messages that we see on tv
[2:12:26.280 --> 2:12:29.800]  it's the tv that is a message itself that's why they call it television
[2:12:29.800 --> 2:12:33.240]  program the medium is the the medium is the message
[2:12:33.240 --> 2:12:37.240]  yes sir that's what i'm trying to say well that's it i've got articles here
[2:12:37.240 --> 2:12:40.360]  man walks off cliff and plummet 60 feet to his death
[2:12:40.360 --> 2:12:44.920]  on christmas day all day while distracted by his cell phone
[2:12:44.920 --> 2:12:48.760]  literally third world diseases are becoming uh
[2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:52.920]  antibiotic immune not resistant all these diseases are exploding
[2:12:52.920 --> 2:12:57.400]  mass death statistically is increasing all sorts of real problems
[2:12:57.400 --> 2:13:00.520]  and our elites don't even care because they've got advanced medicines and
[2:13:00.520 --> 2:13:03.480]  technologies that basically protect them it's well known
[2:13:03.480 --> 2:13:08.040]  and it's just crazy that that the average person steve
[2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:11.480]  quell would want to go along with this thinking they'll be safe i talked to a
[2:13:11.480 --> 2:13:15.080]  lot of really famous people's i know you do off record
[2:13:15.080 --> 2:13:18.840]  and some of them i mean you know just you know
[2:13:18.840 --> 2:13:22.920]  people think of them as you know mr tough guy but they
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:26.360]  can't believe that i'm willing to go on air and do this stuff
[2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:30.040]  i talked to so many military people that i mean you know famous special forces
[2:13:30.040 --> 2:13:33.880]  people you name it they're scared of this system
[2:13:33.880 --> 2:13:38.360]  but i don't get how i'd be scared not to fight it and let it win
[2:13:38.360 --> 2:13:41.960]  i'm not fighting this because i'm full of courage i'm fighting it because
[2:13:41.960 --> 2:13:46.040]  i realize i'm like you know a dog in a cage being lowered into water
[2:13:46.040 --> 2:13:49.080]  i need to get out of here i'm gonna drown i mean don't they have survival
[2:13:49.080 --> 2:13:51.080]  instincts when you see something like this coming
[2:13:51.080 --> 2:13:55.560]  you can't run from this all you can do is fight it where is the fighting spirit
[2:13:55.560 --> 2:13:59.400]  i mean i know people are waking up but where's the fighting spirit steve quell
[2:13:59.400 --> 2:14:03.960]  to to really get aggressive with this well it's mind control alex and it's
[2:14:03.960 --> 2:14:07.400]  the it's the numbing and dumbing down okay
[2:14:07.400 --> 2:14:12.760]  nobody's out of fighting prime when number one they refuse to even acknowledge
[2:14:12.760 --> 2:14:16.280]  that there's a war on also the thing is that people
[2:14:16.280 --> 2:14:20.600]  have no fear of god anymore but they have fear of man and i i said this on the
[2:14:20.600 --> 2:14:24.440]  radio and i stand by it do you realize everybody who is out of the
[2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:28.680]  military their top positions generals admirals etc took a note to defend the
[2:14:28.680 --> 2:14:31.320]  constitution against all enemies foreign domestic
[2:14:31.320 --> 2:14:34.680]  yet they basically left with their pensions and they went quiet
[2:14:34.680 --> 2:14:38.760]  there's maybe a few exceptions you know some of them i know in the background
[2:14:38.760 --> 2:14:42.520]  when all hell breaks loose so do they okay so it's not hopeless
[2:14:42.520 --> 2:14:46.120]  but i can tell you this the country is totally given over
[2:14:46.120 --> 2:14:51.080]  to witchcraft satanism luciferianism and globalism
[2:14:51.080 --> 2:14:55.800]  and again what you're seeing is you have talked i've talked ladies and gentlemen
[2:14:55.800 --> 2:14:59.320]  you're talking a quarter of a billion people all in all that have been
[2:14:59.320 --> 2:15:02.440]  murdered when global disarmament went into play
[2:15:02.440 --> 2:15:05.240]  well listen listen the left is getting really aggressive
[2:15:05.240 --> 2:15:08.600]  now too they're doing all sorts of dirty tricks behind the scenes even their
[2:15:08.600 --> 2:15:11.880]  low-level minions are like demonically activating
[2:15:11.880 --> 2:15:15.800]  like zombies getting a radio frequency and i use that as an allegory
[2:15:15.800 --> 2:15:20.360]  and and and like false police reports you name it starting fights with me and
[2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:23.880]  you know lines at checkout counters because of who i am they're like it's
[2:15:23.880 --> 2:15:27.480]  their time they're like charging up their
[2:15:27.480 --> 2:15:31.720]  they feel their hour is here well you're correct and the bible talks
[2:15:31.720 --> 2:15:35.880]  specifically about that where war is going to be made on the saint you know
[2:15:35.880 --> 2:15:39.400]  and the thing is they know can i say something they know now they've got
[2:15:39.400 --> 2:15:42.920]  legal cover they know they've got evil spiritual cover
[2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:46.440]  and the problem is the christians don't get it they're serious and by the way
[2:15:46.440 --> 2:15:50.600]  alex just as a word of encouragement you
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:15:54.520]  know the people that you know that are capable of providing you
[2:15:54.520 --> 2:15:58.360]  you know 24-hour security i would recommend you
[2:15:58.360 --> 2:16:02.040]  update it i really would the point being is i've learned something living in
[2:16:02.040 --> 2:16:04.920]  the world of death threats and operations you know
[2:16:04.920 --> 2:16:08.680]  against me is that you cannot take it for granted
[2:16:08.680 --> 2:16:12.680]  you cannot take it for granted and so just a word because you know i don't
[2:16:12.680 --> 2:16:15.640]  know when you and i'll ever be on the radio again together i don't know what
[2:16:15.640 --> 2:16:18.440]  comes down i can tell you this world war three
[2:16:18.440 --> 2:16:22.120]  is literally one here triggered away and basically
[2:16:22.120 --> 2:16:25.560]  blemer prudent as is probably going to stand out as one of the greatest
[2:16:25.560 --> 2:16:29.880]  generals in history he's given his control his
[2:16:29.880 --> 2:16:34.280]  anonymous nuclear fire control to his field commanders and if people don't
[2:16:34.280 --> 2:16:38.440]  think he's serious i would say this you saw what happened when they shot down
[2:16:38.440 --> 2:16:42.920]  one jet wait until nato pushes turkey by the way i want to keep you for the full
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:45.880]  hour i want to get into world war three after the collars if you can save the
[2:16:45.880 --> 2:16:51.800]  rest of our i want to get into the the former head of di a going public as you
[2:16:51.800 --> 2:16:54.840]  know two months ago and saying our government created isis runs it
[2:16:54.840 --> 2:16:59.320]  premeditated that that's a big act of courage in this land of cowards
[2:16:59.320 --> 2:17:03.000]  where that's going and the fact that how this could trigger world war three
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:05.800]  or the next big war with what rush is doing and you're right
[2:17:05.800 --> 2:17:09.000]  hooten has given launch power to the generals in the field
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:13.800]  unprecedented danger and the average yuppie is just making jokes
[2:17:13.800 --> 2:17:17.080]  the daily beast is making jokes they really all think it's funny
[2:17:17.080 --> 2:17:20.360]  we're going to skip this network break i want to go to these collars now
[2:17:20.360 --> 2:17:23.480]  simon in florida you're on the air worldwide
[2:17:23.480 --> 2:17:27.480]  with steve quayle go ahead hey gentlemen how are we doing today
[2:17:27.480 --> 2:17:31.240]  we're all right brother go ahead great the questions for steve
[2:17:31.240 --> 2:17:35.400]  steve um we know things will be like they were in the days of no before the
[2:17:35.400 --> 2:17:38.280]  return of christ and i wanted to know what you thought
[2:17:38.280 --> 2:17:42.680]  about climate change and geoengineering and what they might have to do with
[2:17:42.680 --> 2:17:47.720]  possible giants and changing the atmospheric pressure and oxygen levels
[2:17:47.720 --> 2:17:51.000]  to create that specifically i want to get what you know where we can prove
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:53.720]  here is that they've come out with the spesodium others admitted
[2:17:53.720 --> 2:17:58.120]  that that the jet condensation not crystals but but the jet fumes are
[2:17:58.120 --> 2:18:01.480]  creating terraforming the earth is 22 to 31
[2:18:01.480 --> 2:18:03.960]  percent darker depending on what area you look at
[2:18:03.960 --> 2:18:08.760]  and it's a big secret program to add the different aluminum dioxide barium and
[2:18:08.760 --> 2:18:13.400]  other isotopes to the jet fuel through the classic jet engine
[2:18:13.400 --> 2:18:17.320]  to disperse and aerosolize so i want to go back to that question think of the
[2:18:17.320 --> 2:18:21.080]  call simon why are why are they now kind of
[2:18:21.080 --> 2:18:24.040]  admitting some of this and and clearly if they have weather
[2:18:24.040 --> 2:18:27.480]  weapons then they could create earth calamities to push their carbon
[2:18:27.480 --> 2:18:30.280]  taxes what's really behind this from your research
[2:18:30.280 --> 2:18:33.800]  well first of all simon's on to something and i you know here's the deal
[2:18:33.800 --> 2:18:37.720]  alex geoengineering and and again an austin general
[2:18:37.720 --> 2:18:42.360]  told me this it's terraforming t-e-r-r-o-r forming
[2:18:42.360 --> 2:18:45.960]  the idea is to do away with humanity as you know it
[2:18:45.960 --> 2:18:49.640]  now the idea is to come up with a if you will hybridize
[2:18:49.640 --> 2:18:55.960]  the uh a vestige of former humanity and bring in an atmosphere that's similar
[2:18:55.960 --> 2:18:59.640]  which will support the life look you said something that's really
[2:18:59.640 --> 2:19:03.800]  i think even beyond the depths of what most people can understand
[2:19:03.800 --> 2:19:06.440]  you said it's almost like all the demons have been turned loose
[2:19:06.440 --> 2:19:10.920]  all hell has opened up and i know this sounds almost metaphoric in the monsters
[2:19:10.920 --> 2:19:14.600]  out there the the the two-legged monsters that are terrestrial origin will
[2:19:14.600 --> 2:19:16.840]  say i don't believe all that stuff he's talking
[2:19:16.840 --> 2:19:19.480]  about what simon the caller was talking about is
[2:19:19.480 --> 2:19:24.440]  they are actually manipulating the atmosphere to make it inhospitable
[2:19:24.440 --> 2:19:28.520]  to mankind but very hospitable to the genetic mutations
[2:19:28.520 --> 2:19:33.240]  and i what i call the monsters are making laboratories you know all i know
[2:19:33.240 --> 2:19:37.080]  is this stuff is all really going on and and if what we know
[2:19:37.080 --> 2:19:40.600]  right i mean hillary said taking over the internet is going to be the new
[2:19:40.600 --> 2:19:44.200]  manhattan project and she admitted we have many other manhattan projects they
[2:19:44.200 --> 2:19:47.960]  do and they're just taking all our resources and building god knows what
[2:19:47.960 --> 2:19:50.760]  they act like they don't care and then every chance they get
[2:19:50.760 --> 2:19:54.120]  they're massacring christians all over the world
[2:19:54.120 --> 2:19:58.440]  and it is spiritual they want to play god they want to do ugly things frank
[2:19:58.440 --> 2:20:02.120]  in new york you're on the air thanks for holding go ahead
[2:20:02.120 --> 2:20:06.040]  good afternoon my friends how are you good brother go ahead
[2:20:06.040 --> 2:20:09.240]  okay i have a question for you alex and another question for mr carl
[2:20:09.240 --> 2:20:14.040]  sure go ahead the first question talk to you sir how are you thank you
[2:20:14.040 --> 2:20:18.680]  okay um you guys were talking about um you know mixing the seed you know in
[2:20:18.680 --> 2:20:21.880]  the bible of states um keep my decrees do not make
[2:20:21.880 --> 2:20:25.160]  do not make different kinds of animals do not plant your field
[2:20:25.160 --> 2:20:28.680]  the two kinds of seeds do not wear clothing moving up
[2:20:28.680 --> 2:20:32.760]  two kinds of material um these people are absolutely right these people are
[2:20:32.760 --> 2:20:35.960]  suffering i mean even you know when the god of eating
[2:20:35.960 --> 2:20:39.800]  you know when he ate that apple you know the devil basically said you will
[2:20:39.800 --> 2:20:42.600]  become god so these people believe that they're gonna
[2:20:42.600 --> 2:20:46.600]  their salvation is just not consistent that they're gonna live forever which is
[2:20:46.600 --> 2:20:51.160]  which is totally uh uh uh they're playing god they're on a total power
[2:20:51.160 --> 2:20:54.600]  trip being promised by the god of this world whether it's real or not for
[2:20:54.600 --> 2:20:58.040]  atheist the art type the mass consciousness whatever you want to call
[2:20:58.040 --> 2:21:01.960]  it it's real like Kurzweil said i don't believe in god yet i'm gonna become god
[2:21:01.960 --> 2:21:06.760]  the globalist believe they're a god and the god they act like historically is
[2:21:06.760 --> 2:21:11.640]  the exact duplicate of lucifer the devil steve quail
[2:21:11.640 --> 2:21:15.400]  well god in the book of genesis set up barriers and saw what said what he
[2:21:15.400 --> 2:21:19.960]  created was good so every barrier that god created is now coming down
[2:21:19.960 --> 2:21:23.800]  that's what jesus meant when he said the gates of hell and genetics were mixed
[2:21:23.800 --> 2:21:27.480]  and all this wild stuff that reads like a science fiction book i know
[2:21:27.480 --> 2:21:30.360]  i just the public i don't think it handle all this the point is the elite
[2:21:30.360 --> 2:21:34.040]  believe it and then god destroyed all the life to get rid of this
[2:21:34.040 --> 2:21:37.160]  abomination well whether that happened or not folks you know and of course i'm
[2:21:37.160 --> 2:21:39.880]  a christian i know it did it's all happening again
[2:21:39.880 --> 2:21:45.000]  and the elite are following the bible to a t except they think lucifer is the
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:48.280]  winner steve absolutely look the vatican i'm
[2:21:48.280 --> 2:21:52.280]  doing you know just uh you know we're doing a true legend series my film team
[2:21:52.280 --> 2:21:55.640]  just got back uh from from europe uh you know
[2:21:55.640 --> 2:21:59.560]  rome and and what i'm telling you this alex is what tom horn and others chris
[2:21:59.560 --> 2:22:02.840]  potnam you had leo zigami on your show others are
[2:22:02.840 --> 2:22:06.040]  are saying the same thing look they're ready to announce
[2:22:06.040 --> 2:22:10.520]  whether people believe it or not they're ready to announce that
[2:22:10.520 --> 2:22:14.520]  god did not create us that we are the alien offspring
[2:22:14.520 --> 2:22:17.720]  of extra terrestrial and that's what prometheus is their real religion even
[2:22:17.720 --> 2:22:21.720]  the new york times admitted that uh the transpermia stuff and then
[2:22:21.720 --> 2:22:25.320]  expanding on that they've got the vatican astronomy and saying oh yes
[2:22:25.320 --> 2:22:29.240]  there are other flocks oh yes aliens i mean clearly is it going to be a project
[2:22:29.240 --> 2:22:33.000]  bluebeam where they admit they have plans uh just like a china they're
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:36.680]  projecting these fake cities in the sky to freak everybody out i mean will it be
[2:22:36.680 --> 2:22:42.680]  real but it'll be beyond real okay bluebeam and the technology for bluebeam
[2:22:42.680 --> 2:22:46.520]  you know i mean that goes back a long time that's 20 years old plus you know i
[2:22:46.520 --> 2:22:49.240]  remember talking about that you start talking about that when you're
[2:22:49.240 --> 2:22:53.560]  first started your radio career but the point is that what i'm talking about is
[2:22:53.560 --> 2:22:57.800]  the real manifestation and you're seeing that with what is it child but
[2:22:57.800 --> 2:23:03.480]  childhoods and you know uh the arthur c clark that's on the sci-fi channel
[2:23:03.480 --> 2:23:07.320]  where the aliens are cloaked but they finally manifest themselves and they
[2:23:07.320 --> 2:23:10.280]  can give you anything and everything you want that's the inventor of the
[2:23:10.280 --> 2:23:14.040]  communication satellite right arthur c clark mi6
[2:23:14.040 --> 2:23:17.240]  then give you everything you want there's just a little little payoff at the end
[2:23:17.240 --> 2:23:20.440]  though right and here's the thing you cannot
[2:23:20.440 --> 2:23:24.840]  separate the evil that's happening now from its super natural origin one of
[2:23:24.840 --> 2:23:28.040]  the differences i always try and deal with the root of a matter
[2:23:28.040 --> 2:23:31.240]  and when i spend you know all the years i've spent on this stuff researching
[2:23:31.240 --> 2:23:35.800]  and footnoting it i can tell you this i've learned that people can handle it
[2:23:35.800 --> 2:23:40.120]  if it's presented in a historically footnoted version for instance
[2:23:40.120 --> 2:23:43.880]  you know empire beneath the ice how the nazis one world war two
[2:23:43.880 --> 2:23:46.760]  most people have never stated publicly that i know
[2:23:46.760 --> 2:23:50.600]  that the nazis one world war two the evidence is there
[2:23:50.600 --> 2:23:53.560]  and yet when we talk about genetic experiments we talk about weather
[2:23:53.560 --> 2:23:56.200]  control you know you and i did a show on your show
[2:23:56.200 --> 2:24:00.440]  together uh i guess an interview on xeno genesis
[2:24:00.440 --> 2:24:05.640]  and the idea of sex robots okay look these guys are perverts
[2:24:05.640 --> 2:24:09.400]  you know we're seeing every form of mythological
[2:24:09.400 --> 2:24:13.560]  of legendary mixes going on uh in the
[2:24:13.560 --> 2:24:17.400]  the headlines i mean they're getting us ready with facebook having 50 different
[2:24:17.400 --> 2:24:21.320]  sexual orientations so when they with the chemicals in the food and water
[2:24:21.320 --> 2:24:25.320]  uh you know making us behave in artificial ways we won't even know what to
[2:24:25.320 --> 2:24:28.360]  do because our minds have been so scrambled
[2:24:28.360 --> 2:24:32.040]  absolutely and look at the men you know there's a scripture occurs that comes
[2:24:32.040 --> 2:24:35.480]  upon our nation that forgets god that says the men in the
[2:24:35.480 --> 2:24:38.520]  mystery have become women who would have ever thought with the advent of the
[2:24:38.520 --> 2:24:41.720]  birth control pill in the estrogen going into the water
[2:24:41.720 --> 2:24:45.640]  systems of the world uh you know those of who are at least in the western world
[2:24:45.640 --> 2:24:49.880]  look at what's happening to uh to the pretty much the
[2:24:49.880 --> 2:24:53.480]  uh western world and especially and this is an erasers statement
[2:24:53.480 --> 2:24:57.320]  but eugenics was aimed at the black community and thank god there's a lot
[2:24:57.320 --> 2:25:00.840]  of really smart blacks out there that are listening to you and listening to me
[2:25:00.840 --> 2:25:06.120]  on that but the birth control you know you you probably quoted it uh
[2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:10.280]  the former head of Morocco made the statement that the ultimate weapon of
[2:25:10.280 --> 2:25:13.480]  the invasionary forces of Muhammad would be the
[2:25:13.480 --> 2:25:16.920]  wombs of their women so now you've got and by the way I don't call them
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:21.480]  immigrants I call them invasionists okay the idea of
[2:25:21.480 --> 2:25:24.920]  hundreds of thousands of people coming into this country
[2:25:24.920 --> 2:25:28.920]  that cannot be screened are not being screened and are being armed Alex all
[2:25:28.920 --> 2:25:31.640]  the weapons all the ammunition that you and I
[2:25:31.640 --> 2:25:36.600]  carried the stories on that's all in strategically placed warehouses
[2:25:36.600 --> 2:25:40.520]  for the armies of the Mahdi which are already within our border
[2:25:40.520 --> 2:25:43.800]  it's not when it happens excuse me it is when it happens
[2:25:43.800 --> 2:25:48.040]  but the more important question is watch it happening before your eyes
[2:25:48.040 --> 2:25:52.600]  it should be the ultimate wake-up call
[2:25:52.600 --> 2:25:57.640]  well I want to go back to calls it's all I know is the elite believe in all
[2:25:57.640 --> 2:26:01.160]  this bizarre cult stuff they believe they're communicating
[2:26:01.160 --> 2:26:04.040]  with entities that are giving them advanced knowledge you look at all the
[2:26:04.040 --> 2:26:07.640]  stuff that's going on around us all the technology you look at how everything's
[2:26:07.640 --> 2:26:10.680]  hidden and especially a fraud right behind the scenes
[2:26:10.680 --> 2:26:14.600]  and I can't even get the general public to admit that there are emergency
[2:26:14.600 --> 2:26:17.480]  centers that have already been built at military bases
[2:26:17.480 --> 2:26:21.640]  which which the army.mil will put the internment camp document up
[2:26:21.640 --> 2:26:24.520]  says we're going to quote reeducate americans and how they're going to
[2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:29.000]  process our social security numbers I mean I wish none of this was true
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:33.160]  and then anybody in the know it's a weird paradox Steve and I'm going to go back
[2:26:33.160 --> 2:26:36.920]  to calls but it's woken up the military especially
[2:26:36.920 --> 2:26:40.200]  mid-level and high-level because they now have to know it's real because they
[2:26:40.200 --> 2:26:44.760]  might go operational they know the cover stories bull
[2:26:44.760 --> 2:26:47.800]  but then the general public doesn't know about it
[2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:51.480]  so it has had the effect of waking up a lot of people in the government
[2:26:51.480 --> 2:26:54.840]  which is paradoxical you think of the government as the enemy under a corrupt
[2:26:54.840 --> 2:26:58.120]  system but actually it's one of the more awake groups because they
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:01.880]  are not as compartmentalized and so I just don't see where this goes I don't
[2:27:01.880 --> 2:27:07.000]  see the globalist is are in as good a position as they
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:11.960]  would like us to believe except then it doesn't matter how out in the open it is
[2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:14.680]  to us because for the people in a trance
[2:27:14.680 --> 2:27:18.680]  it's just it doesn't even matter so it's just wow I mean what an exciting time
[2:27:18.680 --> 2:27:21.880]  to be alive Steve. Well it is Alex and again the
[2:27:21.880 --> 2:27:26.920]  thing is is that the best we can do is by the grace of God and and the love
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:30.680]  that God has for his creation that he doesn't want to see destroyed you know
[2:27:30.680 --> 2:27:33.640]  the Bible says God's people perish for lack of knowledge
[2:27:33.640 --> 2:27:37.240]  we give them the knowledge but they have to they had their hearts have to become
[2:27:37.240 --> 2:27:41.240]  alive okay to the truth you know the truth is so
[2:27:41.240 --> 2:27:45.240]  foreign now look we have the greatest manifestation of lies
[2:27:45.240 --> 2:27:50.360]  coming from the US government that's ever taken place and people take it as
[2:27:50.360 --> 2:27:54.440]  if they say it's got to be true you know you can give all the statistics on
[2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:58.040]  gun control you can show all the pictures of people being shot in the head in
[2:27:58.040 --> 2:28:01.880]  trenches but to the liberal the agenda okay the
[2:28:01.880 --> 2:28:04.680]  agent listen the the liberal mindset is like Michael
[2:28:04.680 --> 2:28:08.040]  Savage says in my opinion it's a mental disorder
[2:28:08.040 --> 2:28:11.800]  and what's happening is is that you have almost a
[2:28:11.800 --> 2:28:18.840]  a universal nightmare of denial going on in the masses but that's exactly what
[2:28:18.840 --> 2:28:23.320]  the globalist the satanist the luciferians and and the devil
[2:28:23.320 --> 2:28:27.320]  himself want you know the their whole goal their whole goal you know I
[2:28:27.320 --> 2:28:29.720]  haven't read childhood zen in probably 20 years
[2:28:29.720 --> 2:28:33.560]  yeah and obviously Clark was mi6 this is literally their plan
[2:28:33.560 --> 2:28:36.600]  except it's humans thinking they're going to become a god
[2:28:36.600 --> 2:28:40.440]  and merge with it but you take out the aliens it's childhood zen
[2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:44.120]  that's their plan well absolutely but also
[2:28:44.120 --> 2:28:48.680]  look we know that the antichrist the the person who antichrist means takes the
[2:28:48.680 --> 2:28:51.160]  place of jesus christ he who said i came here
[2:28:51.160 --> 2:28:54.120]  receiving not another will come claiming to be me that's why they need
[2:28:54.120 --> 2:28:57.960]  this false world war they need the world war three
[2:28:57.960 --> 2:29:01.560]  which then the antichrist will claim his arm again and he now
[2:29:01.560 --> 2:29:06.120]  is the christ in place of jesus christ and the point is is that it's a spiritual
[2:29:06.120 --> 2:29:09.560]  war but unfortunately alex all the prophecies of isaiah
[2:29:09.560 --> 2:29:14.440]  Jeremiah zachariah you know uh daniel hosea aim us all the old
[2:29:14.440 --> 2:29:17.960]  testament prophets we're in the times right now
[2:29:17.960 --> 2:29:21.960]  that they they prophesied and people say i don't believe all that stuff
[2:29:21.960 --> 2:29:26.520]  well then you explain to me how this could all come about
[2:29:26.520 --> 2:29:31.160]  with a global mind outside of an entity apart from that global mind
[2:29:31.160 --> 2:29:34.440]  orchestrating it i call it the symphony from hell
[2:29:34.440 --> 2:29:38.440]  and lucifer is its conductor and everything they're doing is pushing
[2:29:38.440 --> 2:29:42.200]  an end to your individual consciousness and buying into this larger
[2:29:42.200 --> 2:29:44.520]  consciousness but it's not a good consciousness
[2:29:44.520 --> 2:29:48.360]  you're buying into it's pure death it hates you more calls coming up
[2:29:48.360 --> 2:29:59.080]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[2:33:22.520 --> 2:33:29.720]  the front lines of the information war is alex jones
[2:33:29.720 --> 2:33:32.840]  the supernatural would be radio a thousand years ago
[2:33:32.840 --> 2:33:37.160]  supernatural just means something that isn't known isn't in the visible light
[2:33:37.160 --> 2:33:41.400]  spectrum
[2:33:41.400 --> 2:33:44.120]  but i was thinking about the allegory of childhoods in and we're going back to
[2:33:44.120 --> 2:33:46.440]  your calls because steve quill brought it up then i'm going to get to the whole
[2:33:46.440 --> 2:33:53.960]  world war scenario with russia but if you look at that
[2:33:53.960 --> 2:33:57.480]  plot of childhoods in not the mini series i haven't seen it but i'm told it's
[2:33:57.480 --> 2:34:02.200]  different on sci-fi channel but the book itself written by
[2:34:02.200 --> 2:34:06.200]  the inventor of the communications satellite and a bunch of other stuff
[2:34:06.200 --> 2:34:11.160]  mi6 futurist mi6 mastermind the late great
[2:34:11.160 --> 2:34:15.400]  arthur c clark he realized that all of his books were an allegory and he
[2:34:15.400 --> 2:34:19.400]  actually wrote essays on this admitting it like 2001
[2:34:19.400 --> 2:34:23.320]  is a parable because you know only one human
[2:34:23.320 --> 2:34:28.280]  transcends and goes to the stargate and he's gotta
[2:34:28.280 --> 2:34:34.360]  defeat the ai first the artificial intelligence his own creation
[2:34:34.360 --> 2:34:37.080]  which the elite admit they expect to have a battle with i mean these people
[2:34:37.080 --> 2:34:40.760]  this is a religion folks this is all planned out
[2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:45.160]  and then if they can create a ai harness it control it
[2:34:45.160 --> 2:34:48.040]  then they're going to go and be these star children and the new sun will be
[2:34:48.040 --> 2:34:53.240]  born lucifer i mean that's the plot of those three books
[2:34:53.240 --> 2:34:56.040]  gee i wonder what he's telling you when the new star is called lucifer the new
[2:34:56.040 --> 2:35:02.600]  gods born the humans go to the dimension come back ignite the sun
[2:35:02.600 --> 2:35:05.400]  they're a new god
[2:35:06.040 --> 2:35:12.360]  and they said they can take us there they got a brand new god and they can
[2:35:12.360 --> 2:35:17.240]  slay us there they can kill us there so we can be reborn
[2:35:17.240 --> 2:35:24.840]  they got a brand new god brand new god that's what they're telling us
[2:35:24.840 --> 2:35:29.080]  and that's it oh free health care oh free goodies oh free shots
[2:35:29.080 --> 2:35:31.800]  that are gonna help you but it's not even like childhoods end where they give
[2:35:31.800 --> 2:35:33.880]  you the shot you live an extra hundred years
[2:35:33.880 --> 2:35:40.520]  they give you the shot you fall down have started having convulsions
[2:35:40.520 --> 2:35:44.120]  that's how incredible the mind control is is the
[2:35:44.120 --> 2:35:47.480]  the inserts on the vaccines say they don't protect you
[2:35:47.480 --> 2:35:51.560]  say they can kill you say they can give you all these all these disorders
[2:35:51.560 --> 2:35:56.440]  lowers your immunity to the flu and people look at me and they go
[2:35:56.440 --> 2:36:00.200]  that can't be true the system's good and i go just read the insert please
[2:36:00.200 --> 2:36:05.240]  please please no i'm not going to
[2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:13.320]  and there is that mass Stockholm syndrome my term mass Stockholm syndrome
[2:36:13.960 --> 2:36:17.880]  and again it's that paradox of
[2:36:19.240 --> 2:36:23.240]  most people that actually work in the CIA or the FBI or all these different
[2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:27.480]  agencies or contractors themselves are either
[2:36:27.480 --> 2:36:30.440]  ideologues who are compartmentalized and believe what they're doing or
[2:36:30.440 --> 2:36:34.200]  they're completely freaked out completely whacked out and completely
[2:36:34.200 --> 2:36:37.000]  scared and they're just trying to do the limited
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:40.360]  amount of bad they can that's not going to save any of you people we're going to
[2:36:40.360 --> 2:36:44.840]  go to your calls ray and Mike and chris and karen and

[2:36:47.640 --> 2:36:50.840]  you can look at steve quail's view of the world and say man that's pretty far
[2:36:50.840 --> 2:36:54.520]  out some of it but i thought it was basically 50 far out
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:36:58.680]  20 years ago now i think it's like 10 far out but the point is whatever the
[2:36:58.680 --> 2:37:02.840]  truth is every time we finally learn it it's even freakier
[2:37:02.840 --> 2:37:07.000]  and i go back to that paradox steve when we're going to these calls
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:11.400]  how is it i've noticed this that if i have an actual army dot mill document
[2:37:11.400 --> 2:37:15.880]  that's on army dot mill saying that they are preparing
[2:37:15.880 --> 2:37:19.480]  hundreds of thousands of employees and private contractors to man
[2:37:19.480 --> 2:37:24.120]  emergency centers with reeducation camps for the american people if i guys
[2:37:24.120 --> 2:37:27.640]  just type in reeducation camp army manual
[2:37:27.640 --> 2:37:30.760]  no one attacks me on it no one says it's not true
[2:37:30.760 --> 2:37:33.880]  there's no rachel madow there's no cnn there's no
[2:37:33.880 --> 2:37:37.160]  they'll just go make up something i said and attack that straw man they'll never
[2:37:37.160 --> 2:37:43.160]  they know it's real fm 39-40 and others
[2:37:43.160 --> 2:37:47.320]  but they won't even address it i mean you've been around these people
[2:37:47.320 --> 2:37:52.440]  i mean i've been around them what's weird is at that level though
[2:37:52.440 --> 2:37:55.960]  they're so sycophantic and such cowards they're not like some special forces
[2:37:55.960 --> 2:37:59.400]  captain or colonel or general totally freaked out hiding
[2:37:59.400 --> 2:38:02.040]  in the middle of nowhere with their family because they know too much at least
[2:38:02.040 --> 2:38:04.600]  they don't love it and think it's cute because they're real people
[2:38:04.600 --> 2:38:08.520]  it's these soft weird cowards are the ultimate
[2:38:08.520 --> 2:38:12.680]  progenitor of the takeover they're giving birth to it because they never were on
[2:38:12.680 --> 2:38:16.120]  hard times they never got beat up they never went through real
[2:38:16.120 --> 2:38:19.800]  hell they never saw real evil they're divorced from it
[2:38:19.800 --> 2:38:24.360]  sitting back with the instrumentality of high-tech
[2:38:24.360 --> 2:38:29.560]  enslavement playing the instrument like their virtuosos
[2:38:29.560 --> 2:38:34.600]  proud of themselves not seeing that they stand in the jaws
[2:38:34.600 --> 2:38:41.640]  of a huge stinking red-eyed anglerfish that is their
[2:38:41.640 --> 2:38:45.800]  papa but it isn't their papa i mean they don't get that at the top of the
[2:38:45.800 --> 2:38:50.040]  pyramid you can smell the death you can see it
[2:38:50.040 --> 2:38:54.440]  those of us it's just like oh my god the smoke coming out of it i mean i want to
[2:38:54.440 --> 2:38:57.800]  get close to it it just reeks of directly out of the
[2:38:57.800 --> 2:39:01.720]  pit of hell i mean deaths of this planet engineered
[2:39:01.720 --> 2:39:05.640]  spiritual virus meant to shut us down and kill us
[2:39:05.640 --> 2:39:10.520]  and then they just sit there hopping around rejoicing when they're the biggest
[2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:16.760]  schmuck chump idiots i've ever seen in my life i mean
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:21.160]  they are such born losers that they think
[2:39:21.160 --> 2:39:25.400]  they're actually part of the winning team when history and everything shows
[2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:28.840]  and what's currently happening that this system will
[2:39:28.840 --> 2:39:33.560]  personally tear its minions to part because they're totally unprotected
[2:39:33.560 --> 2:39:36.760]  spiritually i mean i just don't know how they don't see
[2:39:36.760 --> 2:39:41.240]  the incredible peril they're in because they're such cowards
[2:39:41.240 --> 2:39:45.080]  but they're so cowardly they convince themselves they're safe
[2:39:45.080 --> 2:39:48.840]  when they're in the most dangerous position they could be in
[2:39:48.840 --> 2:39:53.240]  go ahead my friend well first of all alex you know i i couldn't
[2:39:53.240 --> 2:39:56.920]  agree more wholeheartedly and even even
[2:39:56.920 --> 2:40:01.000]  passages the old testament talk about all these rich and powerful people
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:04.040]  when they are in hell they see lucifer there too
[2:40:04.040 --> 2:40:07.240]  and they're saying is this a man that caused the nations to tremble
[2:40:07.240 --> 2:40:10.280]  i want to draw attention to something i received today and i think it just
[2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:13.240]  received a couple hours ago so i want you to uh
[2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:16.280]  i just posted a couple hours ago it's a conversation
[2:40:16.280 --> 2:40:19.880]  one paragraph about what they're doing to come take the guns away okay
[2:40:19.880 --> 2:40:24.440]  it's between a guy named jim and michael uh he said the guy said steve i
[2:40:24.440 --> 2:40:27.640]  sent a friend the link the story about the testing gun confiscation in
[2:40:27.640 --> 2:40:30.360]  illinois he worked for the sheriff's department for 25
[2:40:30.360 --> 2:40:34.760]  years here's his reply today i would have said there's no way this
[2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:38.600]  is going to happen my son worked with a man that told her
[2:40:38.600 --> 2:40:42.760]  his son a marine was training for gun confiscation in a war
[2:40:42.760 --> 2:40:47.160]  in the boundaries u.s his son has been trained down south and the dad spoke
[2:40:47.160 --> 2:40:50.840]  with him before november and this was what the son told dad
[2:40:50.840 --> 2:40:53.880]  time to make sure your kit in other words your prepper supply
[2:40:53.880 --> 2:40:57.240]  already in sound civil war two is almost ready to start
[2:40:57.240 --> 2:41:01.800]  it sounds to me like it sounds to me when do you want to sit down and talk
[2:41:01.800 --> 2:41:06.520]  question mark god help us michael so alex the thing is look
[2:41:06.520 --> 2:41:12.680]  we've laid out over and over and over thousands of hours of broadcasts
[2:41:12.680 --> 2:41:16.440]  thousands of documents thousands of news links
[2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:22.840]  thousands of interviews okay literally and and telling people from insiders
[2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:26.840]  this is coming and it's you know it's the four monkeys
[2:41:26.840 --> 2:41:32.360]  hear no evil see no evil uh uh what speak no evil and then it certainly
[2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:36.280]  don't speak out against now it's manifesting openly as they prepare to
[2:41:36.280 --> 2:41:40.280]  go operational and i'm going to say this make no mistake we're here at the
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:43.560]  castle gates there's holes knocked through the armored door
[2:41:43.560 --> 2:41:47.320]  there's flames shooting out there's rocks being hurtled over
[2:41:47.320 --> 2:41:49.880]  and then we're sitting here with countless other patriots around the
[2:41:49.880 --> 2:41:54.280]  world very race color and creed trying to hold the gates up and then all these
[2:41:54.280 --> 2:41:57.640]  trendies are sitting around bitching going i don't see any enemies
[2:41:57.640 --> 2:42:03.720]  i don't see any problems i don't see any takeover waiting for those gates to
[2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:09.320]  crumble and fall undoubtedly if it wasn't for ron paul
[2:42:09.320 --> 2:42:13.400]  and countless others patriots out there over the years
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:16.760]  exposing this from berry goldwater to you name it
[2:42:16.760 --> 2:42:20.920]  we'd already be in this system so i love how we're trying to hold it back
[2:42:20.920 --> 2:42:25.080]  undoubtedly the globalist admit what the new order is about 15 years behind
[2:42:25.080 --> 2:42:28.040]  and then they're bitching at us and now we finally been pushed back we're
[2:42:28.040 --> 2:42:32.200]  sliding world governments being announced we're all being verified
[2:42:32.200 --> 2:42:36.680]  that's why they're bringing in the censorship now to shut us up and shut us
[2:42:36.680 --> 2:42:40.040]  down because now they know our credibility is about to
[2:42:40.040 --> 2:42:43.320]  explode how do you see the brakes on this and we're going to calls
[2:42:43.320 --> 2:42:46.680]  well um you know i can tell you something mushroom clouds
[2:42:46.680 --> 2:42:51.560]  speak louder than piss poor excuses okay i'm sorry for the word but that's the
[2:42:51.560 --> 2:42:54.360]  only way i know how to explain it right now
[2:42:54.360 --> 2:42:59.000]  alex it is insanity that people are hearing world war three
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:03.160]  seeing world war three hearing about over flights of of different
[2:43:03.160 --> 2:43:06.840]  nations bombers and submarines off our coasts and
[2:43:06.840 --> 2:43:10.040]  and still you've got a guy that goes on vacation
[2:43:10.040 --> 2:43:13.800]  and the middle east is inflamed and people you know i gotta tell you
[2:43:13.800 --> 2:43:17.640]  something a thought of syria is the only guy standing up for christians
[2:43:17.640 --> 2:43:21.240]  the point is that if you can't even put two and two together
[2:43:21.240 --> 2:43:25.560]  the equal four we go into iraq we totally destabilize it we go into
[2:43:25.560 --> 2:43:28.680]  libya we totally destroy it and destabilize it
[2:43:28.680 --> 2:43:32.440]  we have destabilized destabilized but it all fits the plan
[2:43:32.440 --> 2:43:36.040]  of global upheaval in that global upheaval a a
[2:43:36.040 --> 2:43:40.600]  a western nation that turned from fighting uh uh
[2:43:40.600 --> 2:43:45.480]  terrorism has now turned internal and all of the terrorists are inside the gate
[2:43:45.480 --> 2:43:49.560]  the barbarians are outside the gate and what we're fighting for is the last
[2:43:49.560 --> 2:43:53.240]  life the last husband who gets it the last wife who gets it
[2:43:53.240 --> 2:43:57.640]  we're saying god people and i'm saying i'm praying not using the name lord and
[2:43:57.640 --> 2:44:00.440]  they i'm saying god help the people's eyes to be
[2:44:00.440 --> 2:44:05.000]  open but the bottom line is when people embrace the occult
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  i can tell you this alex on my end and i gotta share this i lay it out so
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:11.240]  clearly in empire beneath the ice how the
[2:44:11.240 --> 2:44:15.960]  nazis won world war two you cannot separate the darkest forces
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:19.480]  everything that you consider evil that you articulate is evil
[2:44:19.480 --> 2:44:23.000]  you cannot separate that from what's going on in our government
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:27.400]  and they brought it with selling the baby parts funding the radicalizes to kill
[2:44:27.400 --> 2:44:30.600]  the christians you see the you see our government
[2:44:30.600 --> 2:44:35.400]  go out of its way to do evil things even though it hurts the interest of those
[2:44:35.400 --> 2:44:38.840]  elites because it's not about money it is about
[2:44:38.840 --> 2:44:43.320]  prosecuting a war and an old score and so it's ancient russia
[2:44:43.320 --> 2:44:47.720]  it's ancient syria not that they're even perfect but they know in the globalist
[2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:51.480]  plan they are slated for destruction so they are
[2:44:51.480 --> 2:44:55.720]  fighting because they have not been fully taken under the spell
[2:44:55.720 --> 2:44:59.400]  of the new world order let's go to some calls here very well said steve quayle
[2:44:59.400 --> 2:45:04.440]  let's talk to ray in iowa thank you for holding up next mic go ahead
[2:45:04.440 --> 2:45:10.440]  uh this is uh ray in iowa go ahead oh yeah hey listen blessings my brothers
[2:45:10.440 --> 2:45:16.200]  um i had a question i was stationed over in germany during the cold war
[2:45:16.200 --> 2:45:20.600]  and uh you know a lot of the rumors were that that uh hitler had gotten out of
[2:45:20.600 --> 2:45:24.040]  there in fact you had talked about that earlier in the show
[2:45:24.040 --> 2:45:28.760]  uh steve quayle that um you had been following that on the history channel
[2:45:28.760 --> 2:45:33.240]  uh hunting hitler and i had been kind of following that as well
[2:45:33.240 --> 2:45:37.000]  and i guess my question would be at this point is
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  certainly putin or the the the russians must know that he got out of there
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:46.840]  i mean they have excuse me yeah they do
[2:45:46.840 --> 2:45:51.080]  Stalin said that i'll quote Stalin that bastard got away and that's what even
[2:45:51.080 --> 2:45:54.200]  putin you know you're you're you're you're really onto something you're
[2:45:54.200 --> 2:45:57.320]  putin made claims about they're not going to sit
[2:45:57.320 --> 2:46:03.320]  back and watch the resurrection of the nazis they will not sit back and do it
[2:46:03.320 --> 2:46:07.240]  so what i think you're going for a caller is the fact yes they do and putin
[2:46:07.240 --> 2:46:11.320]  is starting to blow the lid my guess is he's going to blow the lid
[2:46:11.320 --> 2:46:16.760]  on the whole nazi control they studied that hitler skull it was a female skull
[2:46:16.760 --> 2:46:20.680]  it's not even a male scully isan howard said there's no evidence hitler
[2:46:20.680 --> 2:46:24.680]  died and then look even hunting hitler for the record alex i started my book
[2:46:24.680 --> 2:46:28.040]  eight months before the first story broke on hitler
[2:46:28.040 --> 2:46:31.480]  so i would say this i would say that people need to understand
[2:46:31.480 --> 2:46:35.400]  the occult the luciferian agenda you cannot
[2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:38.680]  the the nazis opened the first stargates
[2:46:38.680 --> 2:46:42.120]  the beyond the ancients okay in contemporary time and people say i don't
[2:46:42.120 --> 2:46:44.440]  believe in that well it doesn't matter what you believe in
[2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:48.520]  every native american site in the united states around the world has spirals
[2:46:48.520 --> 2:46:52.120]  indicating stargate so i didn't mean to cut the collar off but he's really on
[2:46:52.120 --> 2:46:54.920]  to something and the russians are ready to play
[2:46:54.920 --> 2:46:58.360]  that revelation soon in my opinion well you notice
[2:46:58.360 --> 2:47:00.760]  putin's coming out saying global warming's the plan to take over the
[2:47:00.760 --> 2:47:04.920]  world and slay everybody that the western governments run the drug trade
[2:47:04.920 --> 2:47:08.600]  i mean putin is exposing everything and he wasn't doing that just a few years
[2:47:08.600 --> 2:47:12.040]  ago but when they started shutting down russia putting the
[2:47:12.040 --> 2:47:15.400]  sanctions on he really is spilling the beans on him
[2:47:15.400 --> 2:47:21.080]  uh who do you think putin is and who are the russians in this whole history
[2:47:21.080 --> 2:47:25.560]  because in mainline evangelical cia run
[2:47:25.560 --> 2:47:29.000]  influence christianity i'm not bashing evangelicals that's who they targeted
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:31.960]  because it's such a good group of people they try to pump that rush is the
[2:47:31.960 --> 2:47:35.400]  enemy and obviously russia was a globalist evil
[2:47:35.400 --> 2:47:39.400]  created by the globalist uh the soviets were horrible communism is horrible
[2:47:39.400 --> 2:47:41.800]  you look at what we have here today that's exactly what they're now
[2:47:41.800 --> 2:47:46.360]  establishing but but what has russia become now well i think putin has gone
[2:47:46.360 --> 2:47:49.240]  back to his his christian when i say christian russian
[2:47:49.240 --> 2:47:53.240]  orthodox roots i think he's shown remarkable restraint i also
[2:47:53.240 --> 2:47:56.840]  believe that you've seen basically a topsy-turvy
[2:47:56.840 --> 2:48:00.120]  where where the united states used to quote be
[2:48:00.120 --> 2:48:05.480]  uh christian largely you know and no matter what the entity says we were
[2:48:05.480 --> 2:48:08.600]  founded at least on christian principles the idea is
[2:48:08.600 --> 2:48:13.800]  that putin now as the head uh priest of the russian orthodox church blessing
[2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:17.960]  his men and blessing uh their their takeover he knows he
[2:48:17.960 --> 2:48:22.520]  has to stand against the uh islamic hordes and invasion
[2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:25.400]  also alex i want i go on record stating this
[2:48:25.400 --> 2:48:30.040]  ten years ago i said everything i got in in prayer from the lord over that
[2:48:30.040 --> 2:48:33.160]  decade ago was that america becomes a his thing
[2:48:33.160 --> 2:48:36.120]  and is held in total contempt around the world
[2:48:36.120 --> 2:48:39.240]  that's what you're seeing right now and that's always a part of the larger
[2:48:39.240 --> 2:48:41.400]  plan is have us carry out the globalist agenda
[2:48:41.400 --> 2:48:45.880]  then we get the blame then the e you and the chinese basically merge
[2:48:45.880 --> 2:48:49.480]  giving us the blame for everything and i do see in some of their plans they do
[2:48:49.480 --> 2:48:52.680]  want to knock the us out and russia out in the end
[2:48:52.680 --> 2:48:55.480]  well russia knows the chinese are it's the biggest uh
[2:48:55.480 --> 2:48:59.320]  adversary and let me share this strange bedfellows
[2:48:59.320 --> 2:49:03.480]  and the enemies you know the enemy of my enemy is my friend that only goes as
[2:49:03.480 --> 2:49:07.560]  wrong as uh you know you have a mutual enemy russia knows that it cannot
[2:49:07.560 --> 2:49:10.840]  compete with china's uh uh industrial base from the
[2:49:10.840 --> 2:49:13.720]  standpoint of sheer amount of population but russia
[2:49:13.720 --> 2:49:17.560]  leads in high energy physics and weapons they have some of the most
[2:49:17.560 --> 2:49:21.960]  sophisticated systems their fighters aren't built up with chinese parts
[2:49:21.960 --> 2:49:26.040]  the point being our f-35 is and and look every time when there's a donald
[2:49:26.040 --> 2:49:29.160]  cook forcing a nuclear sub boomer to surface or
[2:49:29.160 --> 2:49:33.080]  taking out aircraft the russians are saying don't you understand what we
[2:49:33.080 --> 2:49:36.600]  can do so i think putin i don't think he's rushing
[2:49:36.600 --> 2:49:39.880]  headlong into nuclear war but i believe he knows
[2:49:39.880 --> 2:49:44.120]  that this government under the control of the entities behind the curtain
[2:49:44.120 --> 2:49:48.120]  are pushing for nuclear war and he has a philosophy and want people to hear this
[2:49:48.120 --> 2:49:54.360]  the russian philosophy is you strike first well if you expand and look at all
[2:49:54.360 --> 2:49:56.840]  of this
[2:49:56.840 --> 2:50:01.720]  we have crazy people running this country and they really are out to get
[2:50:01.720 --> 2:50:04.760]  anybody who's self-sufficient i mean that's what it comes down to they want

[3:02:20.680 --> 3:02:23.880]  so metaphysically that's what we're dealing with john um
[3:02:23.880 --> 3:02:28.120]  what do you think about all the craziness going on in the world
[3:02:28.120 --> 3:02:33.960]  oh it's crazy this is all being set up for the beast for the little horn
[3:02:33.960 --> 3:02:37.560]  that the ten horns give their power to
[3:02:38.200 --> 3:02:43.000]  yeah yeah and he's meant to knock out three absolutely let's go back to steve

[3:02:47.720 --> 3:02:53.960]  but steve quayle isn't it crazy that the un has ten regions three mega regions
[3:02:53.960 --> 3:02:58.760]  and actually calls them kingdoms i mean they really are following the bible
[3:02:58.760 --> 3:03:03.240]  well absolutely actually the bible declared the end at the beginning
[3:03:03.240 --> 3:03:06.520]  you know the the bible says surely lord god will do nothing except he reveals
[3:03:06.520 --> 3:03:10.600]  his secrets to his servants of prophets we have the testimony of history but see
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:14.600]  people live in denial of the relevance of god and you know the
[3:03:14.600 --> 3:03:19.080]  one of the uh little words of the lord we're seeing is a wall under the nation
[3:03:19.080 --> 3:03:22.760]  that forgets god if the foundation would be destroyed what can the righteous do
[3:03:22.760 --> 3:03:26.760]  and alex that's something that you have to deal with every day as well as i do
[3:03:26.760 --> 3:03:31.000]  a lord the foundations of this country are in effect destroyed
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:35.480]  and if the salt of the earth won't stand up speak up and act up
[3:03:35.480 --> 3:03:38.440]  in in in you know for that which is right
[3:03:38.440 --> 3:03:42.680]  you know look we're a couple guys and by the grace of god we got the influence
[3:03:42.680 --> 3:03:45.960]  we've got but but you know this alex you know
[3:03:45.960 --> 3:03:51.240]  from the flak you get and from still the nothing changing it's all waiting
[3:03:51.240 --> 3:03:54.840]  for the button to be pressed people know once the button's pressed i will put
[3:03:54.840 --> 3:03:59.000]  it into gun control terms when they absolutely say they're going for the
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:01.640]  guns that's when everything kicks in the high
[3:04:01.640 --> 3:04:04.520]  gear in my opinion that's when those who will
[3:04:04.520 --> 3:04:08.920]  withstand evil will withstand evil and unfortunately too many people will be on
[3:04:08.920 --> 3:04:12.920]  the trains going to their death going well i guess you wasn't crazy at all
[3:04:12.920 --> 3:04:16.600]  that's not the point the point is we're telling them don't get on the trains
[3:04:16.600 --> 3:04:21.720]  don't go don't go look there is manifest evil taking over
[3:04:21.720 --> 3:04:25.080]  if we don't admit it and say no it takes over
[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:28.760]  people don't absolutely it's not like people want to deny it's happening hope
[3:04:28.760 --> 3:04:32.120]  it isn't happening you've got to admit it's happening to put the genie back in

[3:08:49.400 --> 3:08:53.640]  then you heard my one minute rant on the tiny houses that they're can
[3:08:53.640 --> 3:08:57.480]  basically trying to condition you to be a trendy slave
[3:08:57.480 --> 3:09:01.880]  and if they can condition you to accept a small closet that you live in
[3:09:01.880 --> 3:09:05.000]  and pay three thousand dollars a month for it then they can get you to do
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:07.880]  anything then get you to pay a ton of money for obama care
[3:09:07.880 --> 3:09:11.240]  then get you to accept the fact that we have to go to war
[3:09:11.240 --> 3:09:15.320]  with an enemy that we fund and i'm going to play a report on that that we did
[3:09:15.320 --> 3:09:18.840]  earlier in december that pretty much has gone viral it's got over 300
[3:09:18.840 --> 3:09:23.000]  thousand views we just did a a report akin to
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:25.880]  that over the weekend i came in and shot one with alex obama and isis caught
[3:09:25.880 --> 3:09:29.640]  eradicating christianity that's got 74 thousand views
[3:09:29.640 --> 3:09:33.960]  you know came up here on a saturday and uh jones called me up and said hey we
[3:09:33.960 --> 3:09:36.600]  need to shoot a report there's a ton of news going out
[3:09:36.600 --> 3:09:41.080]  and uh in that report he talks about how since obama
[3:09:41.080 --> 3:09:45.320]  came into office uh the attacks on christians have increased
[3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:48.920]  in the middle east that's when it happened it wasn't really going on when
[3:09:48.920 --> 3:09:53.160]  george bush was there although he did plenty to lay the pavement and
[3:09:53.160 --> 3:09:57.240]  groundwork and the battle plan for what we see today this is a
[3:09:57.240 --> 3:10:00.760]  a two-armed strategy here you think the republicans are good and going to help
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:03.720]  you out and they they smack you in the face with a bunch of wars
[3:10:03.720 --> 3:10:07.160]  and uh false flag terror and then the democrats come along and clean you up
[3:10:07.160 --> 3:10:11.880]  with the left hook but let's go back to this daily mail article
[3:10:11.880 --> 3:10:15.160]  60 000 new yorkers sign up for tiny house development
[3:10:15.160 --> 3:10:19.320]  265 square foot apartments with retractable beds attract huge wave of
[3:10:19.320 --> 3:10:22.440]  interest but would you pay three thousand dollars a month for this
[3:10:22.440 --> 3:10:26.280]  and it shows how trendy they look there looks like it's filled with ikea
[3:10:26.280 --> 3:10:28.920]  furniture i'll go to some of the photos here you guys can get them
[3:10:28.920 --> 3:10:34.120]  overhead and uh that's carmel place the new development of 55 properties but
[3:10:34.120 --> 3:10:37.480]  what's interesting about this is that new york has now said there can be no
[3:10:37.480 --> 3:10:41.000]  um we don't have size restrictions on apartments now now they can be
[3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:43.640]  any size and you know normally the average studio
[3:10:43.640 --> 3:10:47.480]  apartments 550 square feet with the average price of 2300 a month which is a
[3:10:47.480 --> 3:10:51.080]  lot but now they're going to make it smaller and charge you more for it
[3:10:51.080 --> 3:10:55.400]  but it looks trendy so more people will go after it and
[3:10:55.400 --> 3:11:00.360]  there was another story i saw over the weekend how uh how millennials
[3:11:00.360 --> 3:11:04.040]  they're the new uh i guess bellwether for everything
[3:11:04.040 --> 3:11:07.560]  they don't like their parents old furniture the old solid furniture made a
[3:11:07.560 --> 3:11:11.400]  real wood they want ikea cheap furniture that falls
[3:11:11.400 --> 3:11:14.120]  apart after a few years that's what they're into because they've been sold
[3:11:14.120 --> 3:11:16.360]  that dream that that is the dream is to have your own
[3:11:16.360 --> 3:11:19.560]  apartment filled with and i'm not blame you know i own ikea furniture
[3:11:19.560 --> 3:11:22.920]  it's it's cheap and it's good and it's it's pretty solid overall
[3:11:22.920 --> 3:11:26.280]  but if your parents are giving you a nice antique
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:29.960]  you should take that one you don't pay for anything you can refinish it you can
[3:11:29.960 --> 3:11:31.960]  do a lot of things with these antiques but they're not
[3:11:31.960 --> 3:11:36.120]  they're not trained on it they're trained to take this small living living in
[3:11:36.120 --> 3:11:39.480]  where you can't turn like submarine submarine living here's another one
[3:11:39.480 --> 3:11:43.320]  came out uh in february of this year life in a 90 square foot box woman's
[3:11:43.320 --> 3:11:47.320]  apartment takes cramp new york living to an extreme but she's in the west
[3:11:47.320 --> 3:11:50.760]  village for just 775 a month which is pretty much a steel
[3:11:50.760 --> 3:11:53.960]  in that area but she's living in a 90 square foot box and
[3:11:53.960 --> 3:11:58.120]  you can see the picture of it right there a new kind of micro apartment new
[3:11:58.120 --> 3:12:01.320]  york fashion industry worker mary hillan rowell calls this 90 square foot
[3:12:01.320 --> 3:12:06.440]  apartment in the west village home okay so it's all and they put these out
[3:12:06.440 --> 3:12:10.200]  all over the place i've got articles i just did a short a short look here's
[3:12:10.200 --> 3:12:14.760]  another one from august inside nyc's and possibly small 100
[3:12:14.760 --> 3:12:17.960]  square foot apartment well the lady living in the west village has got this
[3:12:17.960 --> 3:12:20.920]  guy beat by 10 square feet she's going even smaller she's
[3:12:20.920 --> 3:12:24.280]  even more trendy here's one tiny space big price micro
[3:12:24.280 --> 3:12:27.960]  apartments in portland the units might be tiny but that price isn't
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:33.560]  that's right they're training you to accept and pay more for less
[3:12:33.560 --> 3:12:37.880]  and um are we running into time to play that report am i running out of time
[3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:41.320]  okay all right uh i just want to show you two more articles and we're going to
[3:12:41.320 --> 3:12:44.040]  go to this isis report next big thing micro apartments coming to
[3:12:44.040 --> 3:12:48.120]  detroit there are acres and acres of space in detroit
[3:12:48.120 --> 3:12:51.080]  that you can uh that they're bulldozing houses
[3:12:51.080 --> 3:12:54.360]  and they don't want anybody living there they're rewilding these areas
[3:12:54.360 --> 3:12:58.440]  so what's the what's their solution make small apartments and make people
[3:12:58.440 --> 3:13:01.080]  you know cram them into them and then washington post
[3:13:01.080 --> 3:13:04.120]  what living in a dumpster for a year taught this professor
[3:13:04.120 --> 3:13:07.400]  about the things that we don't need that's right and the people that are
[3:13:07.400 --> 3:13:10.680]  selling you this are multi gazillionaires they're billionaires
[3:13:10.680 --> 3:13:13.720]  that want you to live with nothing while they have everything and they get all
[3:13:13.720 --> 3:13:17.320]  the resources and um this was a another article i think
[3:13:17.320 --> 3:13:20.920]  this is out of the new yorker micro apartments utopia or dystopia
[3:13:20.920 --> 3:13:24.440]  this is a pretty interesting read that talks about you know what are they
[3:13:24.440 --> 3:13:26.760]  really selling you are they selling you a turd
[3:13:26.760 --> 3:13:29.880]  on a in a sandwich it's exactly what they're selling you let's go to this
[3:13:29.880 --> 3:13:33.480]  report now this is about how just kind of lays out the
[3:13:33.480 --> 3:13:36.760]  history of obama and how he's running isis and quarterback and everything
[3:13:36.760 --> 3:13:40.760]  even i even put his uh fronion slip in there a couple times it's got 323
[3:13:40.760 --> 3:13:44.520]  thousand views i'll give you the title when we get back but let's go to that report
[3:13:44.520 --> 3:13:48.520]  last night on my orders america's armed forces began strikes
[3:13:48.520 --> 3:13:52.360]  against isle targets in syria u.s counterterrorism officials asking
[3:13:52.360 --> 3:13:56.040]  why are isis fighters driving so many similar trucks
[3:13:56.040 --> 3:13:59.480]  and where are they getting them from how do we know that the uh arms that uh
[3:13:59.480 --> 3:14:03.880]  are going to uh the syrian rebels are not going to get into the hands of isis
[3:14:03.880 --> 3:14:08.280]  because if we had people who could were there to funnel it to the right people
[3:14:08.280 --> 3:14:11.640]  and i know these people and i know who they are and i know how to do it and
[3:14:11.640 --> 3:14:14.920]  show to other people you are basically saying that even in government at the
[3:14:14.920 --> 3:14:18.360]  time you knew those groups were around you saw this analysis and you were
[3:14:18.360 --> 3:14:21.080]  arguing against it but who wasn't listening
[3:14:21.080 --> 3:14:25.000]  i think uh i think administration in an interview with the new yorker magazine
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:29.320]  it compares groups linked to al qaeda to an amateur basketball team
[3:14:29.320 --> 3:14:32.920]  intelligence officials in pakistan say a local commander from the terrorist
[3:14:32.920 --> 3:14:37.400]  network islamic state has admitted receiving funds transferred via the u.s
[3:14:37.400 --> 3:14:41.000]  he made the confession while being interrogated today we learned that the
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:43.480]  same group may now be in possession of a deadly
[3:14:43.480 --> 3:14:47.080]  cash of american-made firepower stinger missiles
[3:14:47.080 --> 3:14:50.280]  i think it was a willful decision a willful decision to get supported in
[3:14:50.280 --> 3:14:53.720]  surgeons he had salafist al qaeda a willful decision to do what they're
[3:14:53.720 --> 3:14:57.000]  doing which which you have to really you have to really
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:15:01.000]  ask the president what is it that he actually is doing
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:05.800]  as i said before this aspect of our strategy was moving too slowly
[3:15:05.800 --> 3:15:08.840]  but the fall of ramadi has galvanized the iraqi government
[3:15:08.840 --> 3:15:11.960]  so with the additional steps i ordered last month we're speeding up training
[3:15:11.960 --> 3:15:15.240]  of isle forces including volunteers from sunni
[3:15:15.240 --> 3:15:18.840]  tribes in anbar province now u.s military aircraft have
[3:15:18.840 --> 3:15:22.680]  dropped ammunition in areas held by isle terror group in iraq
[3:15:22.680 --> 3:15:25.720]  according to volunteer forces who are fighting the terrorists american
[3:15:25.720 --> 3:15:29.480]  helicopters drop boxes of weapons in yathrib and balad districts
[3:15:29.480 --> 3:15:34.440]  in the salafi province we now hear that president obama will ask congress for
[3:15:34.440 --> 3:15:38.440]  five point three billion dollars to equip and train
[3:15:38.440 --> 3:15:42.280]  iraqi soldiers and quote-unquote moderate syrian rebels
[3:15:42.280 --> 3:15:45.960]  to fight the islamic state militants reports say the u.s military has air
[3:15:45.960 --> 3:15:50.200]  drop weapons for for the isle on several occasions
[3:15:50.200 --> 3:15:53.080]  last month i ordered our military to take targeted action
[3:15:53.080 --> 3:15:57.720]  against isle to stop its advances do you know that he made the air force drop
[3:15:57.720 --> 3:16:01.320]  leaflets telling the isis truck drivers to get out that
[3:16:01.320 --> 3:16:05.000]  bombs were going to fall did you know that did it does anyone know that he
[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:07.240]  did that this is going to make people think
[3:16:07.240 --> 3:16:10.760]  twice about this guy this is not as clear as it may be of
[3:16:10.760 --> 3:16:14.840]  he's just a pacifist or a liberal there's something more here donald
[3:16:14.840 --> 3:16:19.080]  and it's been more than a year now isis's capabilities seem to be
[3:16:19.080 --> 3:16:25.320]  expanding um were you aware that they had the capability of
[3:16:25.320 --> 3:16:28.760]  pulling off the kind of attack that they did in paris
[3:16:28.760 --> 3:16:32.440]  are you concerned and do you think they have that same capability
[3:16:32.440 --> 3:16:37.160]  to strike in the united states the unclassified reports have estimated
[3:16:37.160 --> 3:16:41.000]  that in just the first 12 months of renewed isis operations in
[3:16:41.000 --> 3:16:47.560]  syria and iraq they've recruited more than 22 000 foreign fighters at least
[3:16:47.560 --> 3:16:51.240]  four thousand are westerners so those are americans
[3:16:51.240 --> 3:16:56.040]  brits french citizens german citizens it was very disturbing to pull this from
[3:16:56.040 --> 3:17:01.960]  the um website in september that says of the 381 412
[3:17:01.960 --> 3:17:05.480]  arrivals that came across the mediterranean sea
[3:17:05.480 --> 3:17:09.560]  this just this year up to september that
[3:17:09.560 --> 3:17:13.960]  15 percent were children 13 percent were women
[3:17:13.960 --> 3:17:19.720]  and 72 percent were men such a backlash against syrian refugees coming to the
[3:17:19.720 --> 3:17:23.400]  united states after the word uh that some of these attackers may have
[3:17:23.400 --> 3:17:27.320]  passed through syria 31 governors now say they don't want them living in their
[3:17:27.320 --> 3:17:30.920]  states many presidential candidates calling for a ban or religious test
[3:17:30.920 --> 3:17:34.760]  congress moving from moratorium on new refugees they point out there's an
[3:17:34.760 --> 3:17:38.680]  extensive vetting process that includes the intelligence community the
[3:17:38.680 --> 3:17:41.640]  departments of state and homeland security in fact george
[3:17:41.640 --> 3:17:47.000]  concerns in syria is that we don't have the systems in place
[3:17:47.000 --> 3:17:51.400]  on the ground to collect the information to vet
[3:17:51.400 --> 3:17:55.080]  that would be the concern yes i think that's the challenge we're all talking
[3:17:55.080 --> 3:17:59.960]  about is that we can only query against that which we have collected
[3:17:59.960 --> 3:18:03.160]  you can't account for what you don't know and that goes to the intelligence
[3:18:03.160 --> 3:18:07.080]  deficit that i think is uh embedded in your question but apparently they're
[3:18:07.080 --> 3:18:11.480]  scared of widows and orphans coming into the united
[3:18:11.480 --> 3:18:15.160]  states of america as part of our tradition of compassion
[3:18:15.160 --> 3:18:18.760]  just as terror threat unlike any europe or the us has seen before
[3:18:18.760 --> 3:18:23.800]  it's the ultimate stealth weapon for isis a female suicide bomber is like a
[3:18:23.800 --> 3:18:27.880]  stealth precision weapon stealth precision weapon brian and this is a
[3:18:27.880 --> 3:18:31.240]  major change in strategy thanks to our military
[3:18:31.240 --> 3:18:34.440]  and counterterrorism professionals america
[3:18:34.440 --> 3:18:38.840]  is safe we may have somebody who comes to us
[3:18:38.840 --> 3:18:42.920]  and is simply not on our radar for any discernible reason
[3:18:42.920 --> 3:18:46.520]  and there may also be the possibility that somebody decides to do something
[3:18:46.520 --> 3:18:50.520]  bad after they've been admitted through the process
[3:18:50.520 --> 3:18:54.760]  we do not close our hearts to
[3:18:56.120 --> 3:19:03.240]  these victims of such violence and somehow
[3:19:03.240 --> 3:19:07.880]  start equating the issue of refugees with the issue of terrorism
[3:19:07.880 --> 3:19:10.760]  they're reaching out to various countries that have been fighting isis in
[3:19:10.760 --> 3:19:16.040]  syria and iraq urging followers to attack in their home country
[3:19:16.040 --> 3:19:19.720]  the fbi is still gathering the facts about what happened in san bernadino
[3:19:19.720 --> 3:19:24.520]  but here's what we know the victims were brutally murdered and injured by one
[3:19:24.520 --> 3:19:29.160]  of their co-workers and his wife so far we have no evidence that the
[3:19:29.160 --> 3:19:32.440]  killers were directed by a terrorist organization overseas
[3:19:32.440 --> 3:19:35.720]  or that they were part of a broader conspiracy here at home
[3:19:35.720 --> 3:19:39.800]  because we have the clearest indication yet that that shooting rampage two days
[3:19:39.800 --> 3:19:44.680]  ago in san bernadino california was an act of terror inspired by isis
[3:19:44.680 --> 3:19:47.960]  new detail what a surprise though what a surprise it's been seven years since

[3:24:26.360 --> 3:24:29.080]  watch the whole thing look at the articles that were showing you the
[3:24:29.080 --> 3:24:32.440]  last piece we just played for the second part of that that segment
[3:24:32.440 --> 3:24:36.040]  was how obama was uh has caught running ices
[3:24:36.040 --> 3:24:40.440]  video's got 323 thousand views right now put that out in december
[3:24:40.440 --> 3:24:44.840]  and it just shows you the power of our listeners and our our fans out there and
[3:24:44.840 --> 3:24:47.880]  fans of freedom that are sick and tired of the wool
[3:24:47.880 --> 3:24:50.360]  being pulled over everyone's eyes and they're just trying to show people what's
[3:24:50.360 --> 3:24:54.440]  going on i mean he admits it that he's it's afforded slip obviously
[3:24:54.440 --> 3:24:57.880]  but he admits that they're training ices i just think it's it's so ridiculous
[3:24:57.880 --> 3:25:00.600]  so as i said as we were going to break up i was going to talk about three ways to
[3:25:00.600 --> 3:25:05.000]  get out of obama care and i'm actually in one of these
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:08.120]  and i've used it for a couple years now so i can attest that it
[3:25:08.120 --> 3:25:13.720]  it does work for me um but here's the the article out of fox business
[3:25:13.720 --> 3:25:17.880]  obama care premiums will increase in 2016 but by how much
[3:25:17.880 --> 3:25:21.720]  well they say the annual deductibles for the silver
[3:25:21.720 --> 3:25:25.240]  plan are going to increase 17 percent so you're going to have the deductible
[3:25:25.240 --> 3:25:30.360]  from uh 2,800 going to 4,400 and that's what you have to pay before they start
[3:25:30.360 --> 3:25:34.600]  paying any of those out-of-pocket costs and for the family silver plan is going
[3:25:34.600 --> 3:25:38.520]  to go from 5,800 to 6,800 so an extra thousand bucks
[3:25:38.520 --> 3:25:41.560]  and the average from the deductible skyrocketed in some states including
[3:25:41.560 --> 3:25:44.920]  washington which saw a 76 76 percent increase or roughly
[3:25:44.920 --> 3:25:49.320]  3,500 a year mississippi 42 south carolina 37 percent now
[3:25:49.320 --> 3:25:52.280]  insurance is only supposed to be in case you need it
[3:25:52.280 --> 3:25:55.800]  it's not supposed to be you're paying all this money
[3:25:55.800 --> 3:25:58.520]  to these big executives of these insurance companies who help write the
[3:25:58.520 --> 3:26:01.400]  obama care plan so they could go on luxury vacations
[3:26:01.400 --> 3:26:04.920]  while you're scrambling to pay your bills each month but just so you have
[3:26:04.920 --> 3:26:07.240]  insurance and this is what people don't understand
[3:26:07.240 --> 3:26:14.120]  you're paying that that premium every month 500 600 700 some people 1200 bucks
[3:26:14.120 --> 3:26:17.240]  a month then the insurance doesn't kick in
[3:26:17.240 --> 3:26:20.200]  and start paying until after you get to the deductible that's another little
[3:26:20.200 --> 3:26:23.560]  add-on they put on so that your deductible may be $5,000 so in
[3:26:23.560 --> 3:26:25.640]  addition to paying all this money each month
[3:26:25.640 --> 3:26:29.560]  they're not going to touch your bill until it gets over a certain amount
[3:26:29.560 --> 3:26:33.160]  some plans it's 2,500 some plans you have to pay a lot for a
[3:26:33.160 --> 3:26:37.480]  plan that's $500 a month now i'm going to go over
[3:26:37.480 --> 3:26:41.160]  three groups out there they're called health sharing
[3:26:41.160 --> 3:26:45.400]  groups and basically what they do is there's not a big infrastructure
[3:26:45.400 --> 3:26:49.800]  you join the group you pay your monthly fee and you pay it directly to people
[3:26:49.800 --> 3:26:52.440]  whatever they determine out and that and that comes
[3:26:52.440 --> 3:26:55.160]  and it's a lot less than what you're going to pay for obama care first one's
[3:26:55.160 --> 3:26:58.200]  liberty health share we actually had the head of liberty health share on
[3:26:58.200 --> 3:27:01.320]  about a year ago maybe a year and a half ago talking about this
[3:27:01.320 --> 3:27:05.240]  and the the cost of health care is stacked against you so this is their
[3:27:05.240 --> 3:27:09.640]  bold alternative and basically it's you know it's kind of take
[3:27:09.640 --> 3:27:12.680]  you got to put on your big boy pants you got to do a little bit of work
[3:27:12.680 --> 3:27:15.400]  but let me tell you it's worth it in the end because you really don't need
[3:27:15.400 --> 3:27:18.440]  insurance unless you get hurt and the chances are
[3:27:18.440 --> 3:27:21.240]  you're not going to get hurt chances are you really don't need all this
[3:27:21.240 --> 3:27:24.440]  insurance that they're telling you you have to have you have to have
[3:27:24.440 --> 3:27:28.120]  and so this is one way Samaritan is another one Samaritan ministries i'm
[3:27:28.120 --> 3:27:31.560]  actually a member my whole family is a member of Samaritan ministries
[3:27:31.560 --> 3:27:35.880]  we pay i think it's like 403 a month for the whole family
[3:27:35.880 --> 3:27:40.200]  okay and what we have to cover which you could call a deductible they don't call
[3:27:40.200 --> 3:27:45.960]  it a deductible but after $300 it kicks in
[3:27:45.960 --> 3:27:50.840]  so do you like $2,500 deductible or $300 but we're not going to call it a
[3:27:50.840 --> 3:27:54.040]  deductible they're just not going to cover the first $300 of it but
[3:27:54.040 --> 3:28:00.200]  after that we just had our fourth child lovely little girl
[3:28:00.200 --> 3:28:04.200]  all of it was covered by the by the health sharing
[3:28:04.200 --> 3:28:07.800]  ministry thank you Samaritan and then there's metashare
[3:28:07.800 --> 3:28:12.920]  medi-share a lot of these the only reason these three
[3:28:12.920 --> 3:28:15.720]  are you can opt out of obama cares because they
[3:28:15.720 --> 3:28:20.600]  came in in the 90s there since 1993 all these have been around
[3:28:20.600 --> 3:28:24.760]  that long so they were able to opt out of the obama care
[3:28:24.760 --> 3:28:27.400]  madness that is going on and a lot of people predicted this
[3:28:27.400 --> 3:28:31.160]  2016 will be the year that obama care dies so will it be will be people just get
[3:28:31.160 --> 3:28:34.280]  fed up with putting most of their income you know
[3:28:34.280 --> 3:28:37.240]  after they pay for their $3,000 tiny apartment then they have to shell it
[3:28:37.240 --> 3:28:40.840]  another $600 a month for obama care that they're not even using
[3:28:40.840 --> 3:28:46.360]  it's a lot of money especially with you know wages are not increasing
[3:28:46.360 --> 3:28:49.560]  salaries are not increasing as much unless you're working for the government
[3:28:49.560 --> 3:28:53.400]  and those seem to go up astronomically here's an article
[3:28:53.400 --> 3:28:57.000]  don salazar just put out david spade obama should have more dignity
[3:28:57.000 --> 3:29:00.120]  than to appear on reality tv i think that michelle obama's son
[3:29:00.120 --> 3:29:04.520]  or michelle obama's on ellen more than i am says joe dirt star and he was uh
[3:29:04.520 --> 3:29:08.680]  confronted by uh tmz after he put this he put out a tweet and then he
[3:29:08.680 --> 3:29:12.120]  erased it probably got some backlash you can't talk about
[3:29:12.120 --> 3:29:17.640]  obama so here's what he had to say when confronted by uh tmz
[3:29:17.640 --> 3:29:21.640]  you criticized obama for going on the bear grills running wild i criticized obama
[3:29:21.640 --> 3:29:25.640]  because i thought you know a president should have a little more dignity
[3:29:25.640 --> 3:29:29.560]  than someone i mean i realized that woodrow
[3:29:29.560 --> 3:29:32.360]  wilson when i danced with the stars once but
[3:29:32.360 --> 3:29:36.680]  what presence in reality shows it just sounds weird to me i mean it's just too
[3:29:36.680 --> 3:29:42.760]  much so i think that you know michelle obama's on ellen more than i am i mean
[3:29:42.760 --> 3:29:46.280]  yeah it's very weird it's very weird that we have our president repairing on
[3:29:46.280 --> 3:29:49.720]  reality tv shows hey when we get back we're gonna have the man who sued the tsa

[3:33:37.240 --> 3:33:41.160]  at the bottom of the hour about a half an hour left and
[3:33:41.160 --> 3:33:46.200]  our next guest coming up john corbett has sued the dsa not once but twice
[3:33:46.200 --> 3:33:48.840]  um the first time he just kind of sat around in limbo it got rejected by the
[3:33:48.840 --> 3:33:52.360]  supreme court because they don't want to talk about this security theater
[3:33:52.360 --> 3:33:55.240]  but where it all goes back to where's all go back to well
[3:33:55.240 --> 3:33:58.520]  if you have seen police state for the rise of fema you know where it all
[3:33:58.520 --> 3:34:02.360]  starts the birth of the tsa right there chapter
[3:34:02.360 --> 3:34:06.440]  eight you can go to and watch all about the underwear bomber
[3:34:06.440 --> 3:34:09.960]  and how and within days we came out talking about how it was a false flag
[3:34:09.960 --> 3:34:13.640]  government operation why not because we just decided to say that
[3:34:13.640 --> 3:34:17.400]  well no just because there was a witness there was a witness there saying
[3:34:17.400 --> 3:34:20.520]  hey i saw a well-dressed man get this
[3:34:20.520 --> 3:34:23.720]  bomber onto the plane his name was kurt haskell and he's an attorney
[3:34:23.720 --> 3:34:26.920]  not a guy to run around and just make up stories like that he was coming back
[3:34:26.920 --> 3:34:29.720]  from safari with his wife very successful attorney both him and his
[3:34:29.720 --> 3:34:32.840]  wife were attorneys at the time living in the detroit area
[3:34:32.840 --> 3:34:37.480]  and uh we put out several interviews with kurt haskell
[3:34:37.480 --> 3:34:41.320]  there's one that i actually went to detroit and interviewed him on camera
[3:34:41.320 --> 3:34:44.680]  in person and got him to talk about the whole story
[3:34:44.680 --> 3:34:48.600]  everything from seeing the well-dressed man get him onto the plane
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:52.120]  to seeing the fbi tackle the guy and bring him off the plane how but they
[3:34:52.120 --> 3:34:55.560]  kept everybody on the plane for 20 minutes and then how
[3:34:55.560 --> 3:34:58.840]  they didn't check anybody else's bags they just let everybody sit around with
[3:34:58.840 --> 3:35:02.200]  the bags in a closed room and then he kept
[3:35:02.200 --> 3:35:04.760]  wanting to talk about this sharp-dressed man nobody wanted to talk to him about
[3:35:04.760 --> 3:35:07.480]  it nobody wanted to say anything about it nobody cared because
[3:35:07.480 --> 3:35:11.000]  they knew that was a government operation so there's no reason to even go
[3:35:11.000 --> 3:35:14.520]  there we've played you the clips of i think
[3:35:14.520 --> 3:35:18.280]  his name's patrick kennedy talking about how they had an operation going on
[3:35:18.280 --> 3:35:20.920]  they didn't want to disclose that they were watching somebody
[3:35:20.920 --> 3:35:23.800]  so they let him go through they let the underwear bomber go through they let it
[3:35:23.800 --> 3:35:27.480]  happen they let it happen admitted from a government official
[3:35:27.480 --> 3:35:31.640]  so in response to this john corbett decides to
[3:35:31.640 --> 3:35:35.480]  bypass and show how easily you could fake these tsa body scanners but before
[3:35:35.480 --> 3:35:37.400]  that right after the underwear bomber happened yet michael
[3:35:37.400 --> 3:35:41.720]  chirtoff who was a head of homeland security for a while
[3:35:41.720 --> 3:35:44.520]  he's running around after this happens and we got to get body scanners we got
[3:35:44.520 --> 3:35:46.520]  to get body scanners that's the only way we could stop
[3:35:46.520 --> 3:35:49.640]  an underwear bomb or a boob bomb or a pregnancy bomb
[3:35:49.640 --> 3:35:53.640]  is with body scanners oh it turns out he represents
[3:35:53.640 --> 3:35:57.160]  a rapid scan and made hundreds of millions of dollars off
[3:35:57.160 --> 3:36:00.920]  that technology being put into airports all over the country
[3:36:00.920 --> 3:36:05.960]  making you and your kids and your wife go through the naked body scanner
[3:36:05.960 --> 3:36:08.840]  and we showed you that it shows a naked image of your body
[3:36:08.840 --> 3:36:12.920]  we showed you that there's dna that could be
[3:36:12.920 --> 3:36:17.160]  reprogrammed with those those waves the microwaves the little microwaves that
[3:36:17.160 --> 3:36:20.120]  that it goes uh they come out of the machine
[3:36:20.120 --> 3:36:24.760]  so he he filed a lawsuit this recent one just on December 24th we uh
[3:36:24.760 --> 3:36:28.200]  Paul Joseph Watson wrote about it tsa it would lawsuit after nixing
[3:36:28.200 --> 3:36:33.560]  body scanner opt out and our guest is on the line right now john how are you
[3:36:33.560 --> 3:36:35.800]  doing
[3:36:36.520 --> 3:36:40.520]  hey rob good to be with you again yeah so professional drug trouble maker
[3:36:40.520 --> 3:36:44.840]  is that dot com or dot org uh professional dash trouble maker dot com
[3:36:44.840 --> 3:36:47.880]  professional dash trouble maker dot com that is definitely
[3:36:47.880 --> 3:36:51.640]  what you are back in 2012 you put out the video
[3:36:51.640 --> 3:36:54.760]  showing you sewing in a little side pocket in a garment
[3:36:54.760 --> 3:36:58.840]  and going through the tsa body scanner with a little metal uh it looked like a
[3:36:58.840 --> 3:37:02.200]  makeup case but that could be you that could be the size of a bomb or a
[3:37:02.200 --> 3:37:05.640]  weapon or anything and you showed that it could be done and then you sued the
[3:37:05.640 --> 3:37:08.520]  tsa and then they pitched you with a gag order
[3:37:08.520 --> 3:37:11.880]  why don't you take everybody through the timeline of this
[3:37:11.880 --> 3:37:15.880]  since you uh since you started working on this uh this odyssey
[3:37:15.880 --> 3:37:20.280]  of going against a useless government agency
[3:37:20.280 --> 3:37:23.800]  sure it's been a long time more five years now basically the body scanners
[3:37:23.800 --> 3:37:27.240]  went into primary screening that is they they they were the front devices in
[3:37:27.240 --> 3:37:31.960]  airports across the country uh in october of
[3:37:31.960 --> 3:37:36.680]  2010 uh so since then i filed my lawsuit against the scanners in november
[3:37:36.680 --> 3:37:39.640]  2010 uh gone through uh incredible
[3:37:39.640 --> 3:37:42.440]  litigation just to figure out what the right court to hear it is and what the
[3:37:42.440 --> 3:37:46.520]  rules uh around hearing that case will be and so forth
[3:37:46.520 --> 3:37:52.440]  that actually took about two to three years just to
[3:37:52.440 --> 3:37:55.400]  figure that part out and then another year for them to say that they
[3:37:55.400 --> 3:37:59.080]  didn't want to hear it at all right yeah they finally threw it out they hit you
[3:37:59.080 --> 3:38:02.600]  with a gag order they put out a redacted i'm gonna i'm looking for that
[3:38:02.600 --> 3:38:05.960]  document right now they they uh put out here it is
[3:38:05.960 --> 3:38:11.080]  and it's from the article by don salazar uh doj sensors blogger for
[3:38:11.080 --> 3:38:14.280]  documents they released they put out these documents here i'm gonna give you
[3:38:14.280 --> 3:38:17.400]  guys a larger scan right here now i can see that
[3:38:17.400 --> 3:38:22.200]  and what they redacted out is after united and even on the global scale
[3:38:22.200 --> 3:38:25.080]  including middle eastern countries with extreme civil unrest
[3:38:25.080 --> 3:38:28.280]  and a high prevalence of improvised explosive devices and use on the ground
[3:38:28.280 --> 3:38:33.160]  explosives on airplanes are extremely rare for example the tsa analyzed
[3:38:33.160 --> 3:38:36.760]  hijackings in 2007 and found seven hijacking incidents across the globe
[3:38:36.760 --> 3:38:40.200]  but none of them involved actual explosive devices
[3:38:40.200 --> 3:38:43.480]  so they say they're extremely rare in the document
[3:38:43.480 --> 3:38:46.920]  there it is right there but they they censored you they said you couldn't
[3:38:46.920 --> 3:38:51.240]  talk about that they put a gag order on you yep and unfortunately i'm actually
[3:38:51.240 --> 3:38:56.840]  still under that gag order so i can't even comment on that other than say
[3:38:56.840 --> 3:38:59.640]  i'm glad that you guys found it and and are sharing it with the people but as
[3:38:59.640 --> 3:39:03.080]  far as its contents i unfortunately am prohibited by law from commenting
[3:39:03.080 --> 3:39:05.880]  on it that's our loving country for you right there
[3:39:05.880 --> 3:39:08.440]  telling you you can't talk about information they put out that's why i
[3:39:08.440 --> 3:39:11.640]  want to show you the 28 pages of that uh 9 11 report
[3:39:11.640 --> 3:39:16.600]  well go on so you now you've filed this new lawsuit in response to what the tsa
[3:39:16.600 --> 3:39:19.400]  has done the tsa put out a report saying they're not
[3:39:19.400 --> 3:39:22.680]  going to allow people to opt out of the body scanners anymore
[3:39:22.680 --> 3:39:25.720]  so uh talk about that why you've hit them with a new lawsuit
[3:39:25.720 --> 3:39:30.840]  that's right so uh since 2010 when these lawsuits started coming in i wasn't the
[3:39:30.840 --> 3:39:33.720]  only one there's about half a dozen attorneys and
[3:39:33.720 --> 3:39:37.000]  law students and so forth across the country that
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:39.960]  filed suits and each of the cases the department of justice has said one of
[3:39:39.960 --> 3:39:43.720]  the reasons why these body scanners should be considered constitutional is
[3:39:43.720 --> 3:39:48.520]  that they're optional because you can opt for
[3:39:48.520 --> 3:39:51.400]  now a pat down isn't really a great option they're basically saying choose
[3:39:51.400 --> 3:39:55.640]  death by this way or this way or so forth um but they said it was optional and
[3:39:55.640 --> 3:39:58.120]  now right now that all these lawsuits have been
[3:39:58.120 --> 3:40:01.960]  finally thrown out the tsa is now going back on what they're saying and saying
[3:40:01.960 --> 3:40:05.400]  no now that they're not optional at any time we can actually
[3:40:05.400 --> 3:40:08.680]  force you to go through these scanners so that's that's why i filed suit about a
[3:40:08.680 --> 3:40:12.280]  week ago and where is your suit right now what
[3:40:12.280 --> 3:40:16.760]  is the uh progress of it um so the suit is is just at the
[3:40:16.760 --> 3:40:20.360]  beginning part the tsa has a period of time to respond to it probably a few
[3:40:20.360 --> 3:40:23.800]  weeks and they can ask for a few more weeks if they need to
[3:40:23.800 --> 3:40:26.920]  the lawsuit asked for a preliminary injunction so that'll be the first thing
[3:40:26.920 --> 3:40:31.240]  that's heard to ask the the court to say um you know while we're thinking about
[3:40:31.240 --> 3:40:34.520]  this case the tsa should hold on this new order and
[3:40:34.520 --> 3:40:39.000]  continue screening the way it was before um there's at least one other case that
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:43.480]  also has a motion for in that case a temporary restraining order
[3:40:43.480 --> 3:40:47.720]  which will be heard uh in probably this week
[3:40:47.720 --> 3:40:51.240]  um so there's there's there's a few fronts that the tsa is being challenged
[3:40:51.240 --> 3:40:54.840]  on about this um the other interesting thing is that
[3:40:54.840 --> 3:41:00.360]  this new rule was just arbitrarily made up by the tsa without
[3:41:00.360 --> 3:41:03.960]  what we call notice and comment rulemaking so these federal agencies
[3:41:03.960 --> 3:41:08.040]  that are about to make a federal regulation or rule or issue an order
[3:41:08.040 --> 3:41:12.040]  that affects the public are required by the administrative procedures act to
[3:41:12.040 --> 3:41:15.800]  give notice in this document they call the federal register which is a
[3:41:15.800 --> 3:41:20.280]  collection of all these notices and they're supposed to ask for and
[3:41:20.280 --> 3:41:25.160]  listen to comments from the public um when the tsa implemented the body
[3:41:25.160 --> 3:41:29.080]  scanners in 2010 they didn't do so and they uh they were ordered by the court
[3:41:29.080 --> 3:41:32.600]  in dc uh to actually do so so they actually asked for comments
[3:41:32.600 --> 3:41:36.440]  in 2013 but still have not responded to them but not with standing the original
[3:41:36.440 --> 3:41:40.120]  body scanner decision in 2010 um they have now put out a new decision
[3:41:40.120 --> 3:41:43.080]  making the mandatory they've again failed to do not notice and comment
[3:41:43.080 --> 3:41:46.920]  rulemaking um so the tsa is basically saying we can do what we want when we
[3:41:46.920 --> 3:41:49.880]  want and we don't think the courts are gonna stop us so um
[3:41:49.880 --> 3:41:54.520]  that's what we're hoping is is that the courts will eventually say
[3:41:55.480 --> 3:41:59.240]  your sky's breaking up there's a lot of rules on you but there's a couple
[3:41:59.240 --> 3:42:02.440]  rules and we're gonna ask you to follow those yeah exactly this is a total
[3:42:02.440 --> 3:42:06.440]  lawlessness of our government they make up these rules and regulations
[3:42:06.440 --> 3:42:10.840]  basically out of fairy tales we showed it police state for the rise of fema
[3:42:10.840 --> 3:42:13.960]  chapter eight you can go to it and watch all about the underwear bomber
[3:42:13.960 --> 3:42:17.720]  all about how it was a total lie it was an operation they admitted it was an
[3:42:17.720 --> 3:42:20.680]  operation we've proved it time and time again
[3:42:20.680 --> 3:42:23.880]  yet they keep up with these lies they keep talking about them they keep
[3:42:23.880 --> 3:42:27.960]  creating new versions of them um and now they create these laws where you can't
[3:42:27.960 --> 3:42:30.840]  opt out of the the body scanners that they put in and they just they don't
[3:42:30.840 --> 3:42:35.000]  even ask for public comment they just say that's it you don't have a say in
[3:42:35.000 --> 3:42:38.280]  what we do to you and if they can get through this
[3:42:38.280 --> 3:42:43.320]  john talk about this if they can do this if they can force you into a machine
[3:42:43.320 --> 3:42:47.960]  and say without even public comment what can they do to us after that what else
[3:42:47.960 --> 3:42:51.400]  can they do to us john you know if the courts won't accept a
[3:42:51.400 --> 3:42:55.000]  challenge on on this one on on making these machines by
[3:42:55.000 --> 3:42:58.440]  mandatory it really is a question of how far
[3:42:58.440 --> 3:43:02.520]  can they go and what are the boundaries and if they can get away with this
[3:43:02.520 --> 3:43:08.760]  essentially virtual strip search um can they do a physical strip search can
[3:43:08.760 --> 3:43:12.600]  they ask you to bend over i i don't know where that line is we're asking the
[3:43:12.600 --> 3:43:16.760]  courts to to finally say all right you you've you found the line you've hit it
[3:43:16.760 --> 3:43:21.560]  go back a few steps yeah exactly i you know i've probably made i don't know
[3:43:21.560 --> 3:43:24.920]  15 20 flights since the the body scanners have gone in
[3:43:24.920 --> 3:43:29.000]  place never gone through a body scanner always have to opt out
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:32.760]  and go for the the pat down which is just as humiliating i think it's more
[3:43:32.760 --> 3:43:35.720]  humiliating than the pat down i think they did that on purpose
[3:43:35.720 --> 3:43:39.800]  they create this invasive process where you know they basically touch every
[3:43:39.800 --> 3:43:43.960]  part of your body through the clothes and and even
[3:43:43.960 --> 3:43:47.160]  pull open your waistband and look inside i mean it's pretty demeaning
[3:43:47.160 --> 3:43:50.120]  and the guys that line up for that are you know seem to be like guys who would
[3:43:50.120 --> 3:43:54.200]  like to do stuff like that not um although a couple times i had a
[3:43:54.200 --> 3:43:57.080]  guy's like man i'm so sorry i got i got to do this i got to do it i got my
[3:43:57.080 --> 3:44:00.440]  manager watching me over there i got to do the full the full court press is what
[3:44:00.440 --> 3:44:04.120]  he called it and and of course you you laugh
[3:44:04.120 --> 3:44:08.920]  try to try and mask the uncomfortableness of the situation
[3:44:08.920 --> 3:44:12.600]  but it just shows you what what kind of demons
[3:44:12.600 --> 3:44:16.040]  are running the tsa that they could just and this is create
[3:44:16.040 --> 3:44:19.240]  this is all created to set up now they've got the tsa in train stations they're
[3:44:19.240 --> 3:44:22.280]  bringing them out to concerts they're bringing them to sporting events
[3:44:22.280 --> 3:44:25.560]  when's it gonna stop i mean are they gonna have body scanner machines set up
[3:44:25.560 --> 3:44:29.000]  at every giant public gathering that we all have to walk through
[3:44:29.000 --> 3:44:32.280]  and that and you're right that's they just they're trying to find out
[3:44:32.280 --> 3:44:36.360]  where they can go how far they can take it and um
[3:44:36.360 --> 3:44:41.080]  what uh what other media john what other media have you been contacted
[3:44:41.080 --> 3:44:44.840]  has contacted you about this case
[3:44:48.840 --> 3:44:52.760]  yeah it sounds like his skype you know let's try to go on the phone maybe and
[3:44:52.760 --> 3:44:57.320]  keep him on video skype and just go to phone on there
[3:44:57.320 --> 3:45:00.920]  but let's just look at this go back to 2010
[3:45:00.920 --> 3:45:06.760]  fear pays churtoff x security officials slammed for cashing in on government
[3:45:06.760 --> 3:45:10.120]  experience after last month's plot to send bombs to yemen to the united
[3:45:10.120 --> 3:45:13.880]  states aboard a cargo plane former homeland which is a lie about that
[3:45:13.880 --> 3:45:17.160]  former homeland security chief michael churtoff's whiskerless visage
[3:45:17.160 --> 3:45:20.360]  was ubiquitous on cable news solemnly warning the nation needed stronger
[3:45:20.360 --> 3:45:23.400]  security procedures and of course he was talking about body
[3:45:23.400 --> 3:45:27.800]  scanners the whole time in the past year and a half this is back in 2010
[3:45:27.800 --> 3:45:31.720]  118 million in stimulus funds have been used to buy technology from wrap a
[3:45:31.720 --> 3:45:35.560]  scan but all that money hasn't produced many jobs
[3:45:35.560 --> 3:45:39.000]  of course that's all hovvian post is care caring about if their government's
[3:45:39.000 --> 3:45:46.040]  using this money to create jobs um the a r a a or a r r a act was the
[3:45:46.040 --> 3:45:49.800]  american recovery and reinvestment act accounts for only 84 positions according
[3:45:49.800 --> 3:45:51.800]  to hovvian post analysts of government data
[3:45:51.800 --> 3:45:55.160]  meaning that roughly 1.4 million was spent to create each job
[3:45:55.160 --> 3:45:58.120]  yeah this is a giant payoff this is a payoff for people who serve the
[3:45:58.120 --> 3:46:02.360]  government well who stood up and lied to the american people
[3:46:02.360 --> 3:46:06.360]  participate in some of these events who knows what how how many bodies are
[3:46:06.360 --> 3:46:11.320]  buried in that from the churtoff regime but all this was done to fool the
[3:46:11.320 --> 3:46:14.120]  american people and tell them they needed this security
[3:46:14.120 --> 3:46:17.400]  theater because it doesn't work they even admit it doesn't work in their own
[3:46:17.400 --> 3:46:21.480]  reports which we just showed you this from 2013 as a
[3:46:21.480 --> 3:46:26.040]  don salazar article internal documents uh body scanners pat downs not for
[3:46:26.040 --> 3:46:29.400]  terrorists that's an adan salazar article from
[3:46:29.400 --> 3:46:34.520]  2013 so we've been covering this for years years and years and we go through
[3:46:34.520 --> 3:46:38.680]  it over and over again it's just ridiculous and i want to
[3:46:38.680 --> 3:46:42.680]  find the one that shows here it is this is from 2014
[3:46:42.680 --> 3:46:46.520]  research definitively proves tsa body scanners are useless
[3:46:46.520 --> 3:46:50.040]  researchers with three of the nation's top universities have concluded that tsa
[3:46:50.040 --> 3:46:53.800]  body scanners can be easily defeated by anyone with a mycodium
[3:46:53.800 --> 3:46:57.240]  of know-how confirming that info word confirming what info was reported
[3:46:57.240 --> 3:47:02.920]  first two years ago so we did that back in 2012 in essence the machines which
[3:47:02.920 --> 3:47:05.480]  are supposed to detect weapons can be fooled by anyone hiding a weapon on the
[3:47:05.480 --> 3:47:07.960]  side of his or her body and render it invisible
[3:47:07.960 --> 3:47:14.200]  against the scans black background do we get john back
[3:47:14.200 --> 3:47:21.320]  okay yeah let's go to is this the one uh that's showing people how we defeated it
[3:47:21.320 --> 3:47:25.480]  yeah but okay yeah let's go that way let's show how easy it is to defeat these
[3:47:25.480 --> 3:47:27.640]  body scanners that they say you have to walk through
[3:47:27.640 --> 3:47:31.960]  for your safety to put it to the test i bought a sewing kit from the dollar
[3:47:31.960 --> 3:47:35.480]  store broke out my eighth grade homex skills and sewed a pocket directly on
[3:47:35.480 --> 3:47:38.040]  the side of a shirt then i took a random metallic
[3:47:38.040 --> 3:47:41.800]  object in this case a heavy metal carrying case
[3:47:41.800 --> 3:47:45.160]  that would easily alarm any of the old metal detectors and i walked through a
[3:47:45.160 --> 3:47:48.280]  backscatter x-ray at fort lauderdale hollywood international airport
[3:47:48.280 --> 3:47:51.800]  on video of course while i'm not about to win any videography awards for my
[3:47:51.800 --> 3:47:54.920]  hidden camera footage you can watch as i walk through the security line with the
[3:47:54.920 --> 3:47:58.280]  metal object in my new side pocket my camera gets placed on the conveyor
[3:47:58.280 --> 3:48:01.640]  belt and goes through its own x-ray and when it comes out i'm through and the
[3:48:01.640 --> 3:48:04.760]  object never left my pocket maybe just a fluke
[3:48:04.760 --> 3:48:07.880]  okay let's try again at cleven hopkins international airport through one of
[3:48:07.880 --> 3:48:10.840]  the tsa's newest machines a millimeter wave scanner with automated
[3:48:10.840 --> 3:48:14.520]  threat detection built in with a metallic object in my side pocket
[3:48:14.520 --> 3:48:18.760]  i enter the security line my device goes through its own x-ray
[3:48:18.760 --> 3:48:24.280]  i pass through and i exit with the object without any complaints from the tsa
[3:48:24.280 --> 3:48:28.120]  there it is a one dollar sewing kit from the dollar or
[3:48:28.120 --> 3:48:31.160]  i don't know it might have been two dollars from the dollar store
[3:48:31.160 --> 3:48:35.480]  and eighth grade homex skills you can defeat a tsa body scanner and they'll
[3:48:35.480 --> 3:48:38.280]  probably come after us saying we're bad for showing this
[3:48:38.280 --> 3:48:43.240]  showing that their own machines don't work john how do you respond
[3:48:43.240 --> 3:48:53.400]  yeah it's funny that the international media that responded to that uh to that
[3:48:53.400 --> 3:48:57.720]  video was actually contacted by the tsa's public relations department and
[3:48:57.720 --> 3:49:00.840]  threatened against publishing the video saying that they were
[3:49:00.840 --> 3:49:03.160]  helping someone just to disparage the tsa but
[3:49:03.160 --> 3:49:06.280]  if the tsa never came out instead of the video wasn't true they never came out
[3:49:06.280 --> 3:49:10.920]  to refute the claims uh the problem is these the vulnerabilities that i showed
[3:49:10.920 --> 3:49:15.000]  the world in 2012 still exists today we're going to go into 2016
[3:49:15.000 --> 3:49:18.280]  so about four years later uh with the same vulnerability that would allow me
[3:49:18.280 --> 3:49:22.200]  to take an ak-47 through a body scanner exactly
[3:49:22.200 --> 3:49:27.080]  exactly and they're and they're only uh their next move their move after you
[3:49:27.080 --> 3:49:29.640]  put out that video is to attack you saying you're bad
[3:49:29.640 --> 3:49:35.000]  we're putting out this information here's a uh an article from 2012 as well
[3:49:35.000 --> 3:49:40.520]  john corbett tsa and ffo airport emit lying in f o i a response
[3:49:40.520 --> 3:49:43.320]  they say they can tell us about that they can just lie to you whenever they
[3:49:43.320 --> 3:49:46.040]  want as well what happened back in 2012
[3:49:46.040 --> 3:49:50.280]  it's you know by law they have to produce responses to foyer requests and
[3:49:50.280 --> 3:49:55.160]  they have to be lawful responses but the only problem is there's no penalty
[3:49:55.160 --> 3:49:58.920]  uh if they're caught redheaded not doing it um
[3:49:58.920 --> 3:50:02.440]  the basically the the only penalty is that they're asked to release the
[3:50:02.440 --> 3:50:05.240]  documents that they were supposed to release in the first place
[3:50:05.240 --> 3:50:08.520]  uh after extensive litigation so it's in their interest to basically take these
[3:50:08.520 --> 3:50:12.120]  responses and either not respond or in this case they they flat out lie they
[3:50:12.120 --> 3:50:15.560]  flat out told me they didn't have security video uh when in fact it turned
[3:50:15.560 --> 3:50:19.320]  out they did yeah exactly you know and you're
[3:50:19.320 --> 3:50:22.200]  going to believe that they don't have uh security cameras set up
[3:50:22.200 --> 3:50:27.240]  in that little area where they're going through all these paddowns it's ludicrous
[3:50:27.240 --> 3:50:31.160]  they have this little there and they have signs that say this camera is under
[3:50:31.160 --> 3:50:35.720]  video surveillance so i went back to pictures of the sign of the domes and i
