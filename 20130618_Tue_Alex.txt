[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.720]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:20.720 --> 00:46.640]  I've talked a lot about eugenics being the religion of the globalist. Eugenics, and not
[00:46.640 --> 00:53.880]  just the popularized simple eugenics that's taught in textbooks, but the real eugenics
[00:53.880 --> 01:01.720]  as a cosmology, as a belief system, and really religion for the ruling class and their rationale
[01:01.720 --> 01:04.960]  for what they do.
[01:04.960 --> 01:12.520]  And I went and saw films like Tron a few years ago, the new Tron with Jeff Bridges. I went
[01:12.520 --> 01:18.640]  and saw Superman, Man of Steel last night with my father and two older children, my
[01:18.640 --> 01:31.160]  son and oldest daughter. I went and saw, of course, Oblivion. And all of these films have
[01:31.160 --> 01:36.540]  an anti-eugenics message that are extremely strong.
[01:36.540 --> 01:40.720]  And I don't really spend a lot of time in contact with Hollywood people, just because
[01:40.720 --> 01:45.400]  even when they contact you, then you've gotta run after them, and it's a big hassle. And
[01:45.400 --> 01:52.680]  most of them, nine out of ten, don't wanna come on air. I know there's a Christian Bale
[01:52.680 --> 01:59.920]  movie they're making right now that they want me to be in that's got a big director putting
[01:59.920 --> 02:02.480]  it out, and I haven't even really followed that up too much.
[02:02.480 --> 02:08.400]  I know that Adam Kokesh is in a big movie that's coming out. My point is that anti-New
[02:08.400 --> 02:15.160]  World Order ideas have infiltrated Hollywood. They don't wanna just be left or right. People
[02:15.160 --> 02:23.280]  are really into the reality of what's happening. And I know for a fact Ridley Scott listens
[02:23.280 --> 02:26.120]  to the show. That's all I wanna say.
[02:26.120 --> 02:29.600]  That's why I really don't like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, cuz I know they've been listeners
[02:29.600 --> 02:35.040]  going back about eight years ago. And then look at all the stuff they do. It's like they
[02:35.040 --> 02:39.120]  know this info and decide to totally join the New World Order. I guess it's a move they
[02:39.120 --> 02:43.920]  think is the winning team, and I didn't mean to start the broadcast with a whole Hollywood
[02:43.920 --> 02:45.200]  rant.
[02:45.200 --> 02:53.120]  It's just that I really found about 90% of the messages last night in Man of Steel, and
[02:53.120 --> 03:00.680]  I'm not a Superman fan of a superhero in red underwear. The story's interesting, and it's
[03:00.680 --> 03:06.520]  a Christ story. That's admitted, by the way. I talked about it Sunday being a Christ story,
[03:06.520 --> 03:10.800]  and I saw comments on Infowars that I was crazy and stuff.
[03:10.800 --> 03:18.880]  The creators of it, 1933, said it was a Christ story. That's not debatable, by the way. That's
[03:18.880 --> 03:25.720]  not me just saying that. I know it sounds weird, but truth is stranger than fiction.
[03:25.720 --> 03:30.800]  I just kinda had a realization this morning, and then once I started the show just now,
[03:30.800 --> 03:40.680]  before I get into all this serious news, that it is a really positive thing that Hollywood,
[03:40.680 --> 03:45.320]  especially the newer generation, people up to even age 50, 60 years old, is one of the
[03:45.320 --> 03:46.320]  newer generations.
[03:46.320 --> 03:52.840]  But the new, new generation, especially 30 years old or so, are really awake to how the
[03:52.840 --> 03:59.880]  world works and very cynical. Just like you see the newspapers having record low credibility
[03:59.880 --> 04:06.280]  and Congress having record low credibility. People sitting in the command chairs of propaganda
[04:06.280 --> 04:08.760]  really don't like what's going on.
[04:08.760 --> 04:15.680]  And you've got the old mafia, which is literally mafia. Jewish mafia, Italian mafia, big banking
[04:15.680 --> 04:22.840]  mafia, Saudi Arabian mafia, Chinese mafia now is real big in Hollywood controlling what
[04:22.840 --> 04:30.040]  can and can't be done. There is a major rebellion right under the surface that's been going
[04:30.040 --> 04:31.040]  on.
[04:31.040 --> 04:34.840]  And I've talked about this before, but I mean, I go see these movies and it's like something
[04:34.840 --> 04:43.160]  I would make if I had that skill. I mean, Man of Steel had a very good message. But
[04:43.160 --> 04:46.640]  in a way, it's almost a revelation of the method. I think that's why the establishment
[04:46.640 --> 04:51.160]  allows this stuff to come out, because it's an externalization of the hierarchy.
[04:51.160 --> 04:58.800]  But I'll do a review in the third hour at the start of the third hour on Man of Steel.

[08:02.040 --> 08:08.040]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[08:08.040 --> 08:15.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:15.040 --> 08:22.040]  We have a astrophysicist and world renowned meteorologist scheduled to join us from London
[08:30.000 --> 08:36.340]  for part of the second hour today, Piers Corbin, as one of the most sought after regional and
[08:36.340 --> 08:43.340]  worldwide trend forecasters, sometimes even a year ahead on weather forecasting according
[08:43.340 --> 08:48.700]  to the sun and the position of the moon. Of course, the ancients knew that they didn't
[08:48.700 --> 08:55.700]  know why, but the moon tends to position itself in front of the solar winds and the solar
[08:55.700 --> 09:00.780]  particles. And so depending on what's going on with the sun, and then what's happening
[09:00.780 --> 09:07.780]  with the moon and its position, that then is one of the largest drivers of weather.
[09:08.900 --> 09:12.640]  And they know that when there's big solar flares, or when the sun's going into cycles
[09:12.640 --> 09:17.500]  where there's a higher level of flares, that when a big flare ejects and goes in the direction
[09:17.500 --> 09:24.500]  of the Earth, the flame stops billions of miles away from the Earth. But the radiation,
[09:26.940 --> 09:31.060]  the different wavelengths continues. And that's why anytime they announce a giant solar flare
[09:31.060 --> 09:33.780]  hitting the Earth, it can be a clear blue sky.
[09:33.780 --> 09:39.520]  And I go, well, I'm looking forward to the thunderstorms tonight. Because it's a fact
[09:39.520 --> 09:44.940]  that that's the main generator. It's not potash like scientists thought 50, 60 years ago.
[09:44.940 --> 09:51.940]  It is particles coming in out of space that then pick up other particles and create an
[09:51.980 --> 09:57.420]  electrical charge as they come into the atmosphere. And then it causes a focal point for nuclei
[09:57.420 --> 10:03.980]  to expand and allow water droplets and other particulate to build up.
[10:03.980 --> 10:07.700]  But I don't want to go off into the study of meteorology. Just the UN said four years
[10:07.700 --> 10:14.700]  ago, though, at their big hearing over in Denmark that we vote that the sun does not
[10:15.220 --> 10:22.220]  affect climate. It is all humans. And they voted. And so the sun has nothing to do with
[10:23.100 --> 10:28.100]  the temperature of the Earth. Now, any moron, I guarantee you somebody with a full frontal
[10:28.100 --> 10:32.100]  lobotomy, you can say to them, why is it hot, Billy?
[10:32.100 --> 10:37.020]  It is hot to beat the sun out. I mean, I'm not trying to be mean here. Everyone know,
[10:37.020 --> 10:44.020]  but the UN tells you it's not the sun. Because they can't really put a tax on that. They're
[10:44.740 --> 10:48.820]  trying to put taxes on solar panels now. That's you put them on the manufacturer in many countries,
[10:48.820 --> 10:53.580]  but they want to tax you to put solar panels on your roof in many areas now.
[10:53.580 --> 10:57.200]  So I guess I shouldn't joke around and say that they don't want to admit the sun controls
[10:57.200 --> 11:02.900]  most of our climate and weather and changes in it with its fluctuations. Just as it does
[11:02.900 --> 11:09.900]  the weather on all the other planets and Mars. Very, very interesting to see to see all of
[11:10.700 --> 11:17.700]  that unfolding now. So we're going to be discussing that coming up, that conspiracy theory that
[11:18.700 --> 11:22.820]  the sun affects our climate, because Al Gore says it doesn't and he's God after all he
[11:22.820 --> 11:27.940]  knows best coming up in the second hour today.
[11:27.940 --> 11:34.220]  At the start of the third hour, I'm going to spend a few minutes giving you my review
[11:34.220 --> 11:39.820]  of Man of Steel. I went and saw the new Superman movie last night and I'm not a big fan of
[11:39.820 --> 11:46.820]  comic book movies. I mean, I like more historical or just straight up probable type scenarios
[11:47.140 --> 11:52.900]  in science fiction, because yesterday science fiction is today's reality in many cases.
[11:52.900 --> 11:59.900]  What man imagines, man can tend to build. What humankind envisions, we tend to build.
[12:00.260 --> 12:05.740]  But you understand that science fiction and just the culture in general that's programmed
[12:05.740 --> 12:12.740]  is there to sell a message. And the message I'm seeing in films like The Neutron and The
[12:12.900 --> 12:19.900]  New Man of Steel and Oblivion overall is a very, very healthy message. And that is a
[12:19.900 --> 12:26.900]  mirrored by what I know about people inside Hollywood that the hottest thing for more
[12:29.580 --> 12:34.100]  than a decade and it just gets hotter and hotter is what you call conspiracy, which
[12:34.100 --> 12:37.500]  is just getting outside the box, questioning, learning more.
[12:37.500 --> 12:44.500]  That's all it is, not trusting known liars. And there is a old Hollywood mafia guard that
[12:44.500 --> 12:51.500]  is intimidating and trying to go after people that try to put out positive messages. But
[12:52.700 --> 12:59.020]  what's happening is so many people aren't going along with it in Hollywood that you
[12:59.020 --> 13:06.020]  see the choice now to the anti-family, pro-death, pro-evil, dehumanizing messages versus the
[13:07.340 --> 13:10.340]  more positive messages.
[13:10.340 --> 13:17.340]  And because there's now choices out there, the positive messages are so much more popular
[13:17.900 --> 13:22.500]  that the old Hollywood mafia, even though they want to dehumanize people, have trouble
[13:22.500 --> 13:27.640]  not putting out the positive messages because it's still somewhat of a free market and they
[13:27.640 --> 13:30.820]  want to be more profitable.
[13:30.820 --> 13:34.860]  That's why the globalist openly say they want to get rid of any free market and just have
[13:34.860 --> 13:41.380]  a oligopoly run by central governments with a few major corporations is because they have
[13:41.380 --> 13:46.000]  to then go with the market and go with what people want.
[13:46.000 --> 13:52.040]  And I have been in meetings with the biggest lawyers in Hollywood, famous names. I have
[13:52.040 --> 13:56.400]  met for every famous Hollywood person you've heard on this show, I've met nine or 10 big
[13:56.400 --> 14:05.840]  ones that are just as big or bigger who are afraid to go on air. And it is mind-blowing
[14:05.840 --> 14:12.120]  to see the revolution of awakening in Hollywood, not just in the general public.
[14:12.120 --> 14:17.300]  You see Congress with an incredibly low approval rating, the mainstream media with an all-time
[14:17.300 --> 14:24.300]  low, 77% saying they absolutely trust nothing they say. And by the way, that's a new gallop,
[14:24.300 --> 14:28.820]  there's several new polls on that, but a new gallop poll that's pretty much a push poll.
[14:28.820 --> 14:35.460]  It's more like 5%, 6% from what I've seen trust the system and like the system. And
[14:35.460 --> 14:38.960]  usually those are people that are working for the system and are on a power trip and
[14:38.960 --> 14:43.000]  also not too bright.
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.260]  So I'll get to more of that at the start of the next hour. It's not even so much about
[14:46.260 --> 14:51.920]  Man of Steel, though I will review the film. It's about seeing these messages. Someone
[14:51.920 --> 14:56.600]  argue it's a revelation of the method and externalization of the hierarchy. And I think
[14:56.600 --> 15:02.000]  that's why the upper echelon social engineers allow it or rationalize they're doing it.
[15:02.000 --> 15:08.880]  But the truth is truth is sexy. The truth is liberty is sexy. The truth is people fundamentally
[15:08.880 --> 15:14.140]  can lie to themselves and say that evil and dehumanization is going to give them power.
[15:14.140 --> 15:19.540]  But deep down, people are hardwired to know you're not going to escape what you're doing.
[15:19.540 --> 15:25.920]  So folks that have used the dark side to gain power, they actually, if you could use this
[15:25.920 --> 15:32.320]  term lust after the light, it's the grass on the other side of the canyon that is truly
[15:32.320 --> 15:37.860]  greener. And so it's a paradox.
[15:37.860 --> 15:42.560]  Most of them then just get to where they hate goodness and want to eradicate it because
[15:42.560 --> 15:47.800]  they want to sleep in the dark slumber of wickedness. And it's like a bright light being
[15:47.800 --> 15:53.120]  done. They want to extinguish it. But others who were brought up in evil but aren't completely
[15:53.120 --> 16:02.680]  wicked, they are drawn towards the light.
[16:02.680 --> 16:09.960]  So we're going to be breaking that down today. And again, Hollywood puts out these deceptive
[16:09.960 --> 16:18.400]  messages like Carol Ann, stay away from the light. Go away from the light. Well, the truth
[16:18.400 --> 16:25.600]  is you want to go towards the light. And again, these are just archetypal images or in devil's
[16:25.600 --> 16:33.460]  advocate Al Pacino tells Keanu Reeves, another guy that's fully awake and super smart but
[16:33.460 --> 16:40.720]  so proud he doesn't talk to anybody. So the media calls him stupid. It's actually the
[16:40.720 --> 16:41.720]  opposite.
[16:41.720 --> 16:47.940]  And the devil says, I'm a fan of man. I want to empower humanity. And I want you to have
[16:47.940 --> 16:53.640]  free will when it's really the opposite. And whether you believe in a physical entity or
[16:53.640 --> 16:58.280]  spirit in the universe of death and destruction, you might as well believe in the devil because
[16:58.280 --> 17:05.080]  there's people that act and behave like the devil in this world, in this universe.
[17:05.080 --> 17:10.560]  Now I want to get into the NSA news and this ongoing soap opera and how the system tries
[17:10.560 --> 17:19.480]  to spin it. There's also riots and demonstrations going on from Turkey to Brazil. They start
[17:19.480 --> 17:23.800]  out as peaceful demonstrations and then the police come and attack people so then they
[17:23.800 --> 17:29.120]  fight back. We're gonna be getting into that. We're gonna be getting into the G8 going on
[17:29.120 --> 17:41.400]  in Ireland with aircraft carriers off the shore for the president, which is just ridiculous.
[17:41.400 --> 17:47.320]  And the media obsessing over Michelle Obama's hair is training the public to be petty. We're
[17:47.320 --> 17:57.720]  going to also get into the phasing out of men as astronauts and as soldiers.
[17:57.720 --> 18:02.480]  That's part of the phasing out of humans, period. So I'm gonna be explaining that as
[18:02.480 --> 18:09.560]  well here today. And we're also going to go over some of the news that's up on infowars.com
[18:09.560 --> 18:17.280]  and prisonplanet.com like NFL to enhance public safety by implementing clear bag policy. And
[18:17.280 --> 18:19.280]  that'll also be on the streets now.
[18:19.280 --> 18:24.800]  They're even proposing in England making you carry clear bags everywhere. They've got NSA
[18:24.800 --> 18:29.200]  telephone poles going up. We told you about this two years ago. Even though it was publicly
[18:29.200 --> 18:32.440]  admitted people couldn't believe it. Now it's being announced in Wired magazine like it's
[18:32.440 --> 18:39.000]  a good thing. And it's also admitted that Amazon actually has CIA computers inside of
[18:39.000 --> 18:40.000]  it.
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.920]  So the new way they're gonna hide in plain view that all the telecommunications companies
[18:45.920 --> 18:53.040]  have the NSA and CIA inside of them is that, the CIA and NSA are leasing space inside Google
[18:53.040 --> 18:59.400]  and Amazon. Yeah, they're right next to the NSA bases and right next to the NASA bases.
[18:59.400 --> 19:03.920]  NASA's the shadow government by the way. I'm gonna be explaining that as well.
[19:03.920 --> 19:08.720]  And again, you notice everything I've told you is now coming out the news exactly as
[19:08.720 --> 19:16.120]  I told you. What do you just think? I just came up with some narrative that was this
[19:16.120 --> 19:21.520]  complex and this detailed. And then it just so happens to match what's now coming out.
[19:21.520 --> 19:27.160]  I know their entire agenda, okay? Because they brag about it. That's what I keep trying
[19:27.160 --> 19:28.160]  to explain to people.
[19:28.160 --> 19:32.420]  So we're gonna be breaking all this down when we come back. It's like I talked about yesterday,
[19:32.420 --> 19:37.960]  New York Times. The brain stems of the Gulf War troops really are rotting. Wonder what
[19:37.960 --> 19:44.100]  did it? A nerve gas, you knew 18 years ago in the studies. Our government blew up the
[19:44.100 --> 19:47.880]  nerve gas and told them take their mask off.
[19:47.880 --> 19:50.920]  Just like they knew the dust was deadly at the World Trade Center. Just like they know
[19:50.920 --> 19:56.040]  glyphosate are giving you breast cancer. They're doing it on purpose, okay? I don't know how
[19:56.040 --> 20:01.440]  else to explain this to you people. They're murdering everyone.
[20:01.440 --> 20:06.240]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, and now the new bird flu
[20:06.240 --> 20:11.120]  recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune
[20:11.120 --> 20:17.040]  system. Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown

[23:55.520 --> 24:18.400]  Got it? Get it. Go to 30dayfoodsupply.com. Alright, let's get into the NSA that the public
[24:18.400 --> 24:25.600]  is now being introduced to, like children being introduced to the outdoors. They're
[24:25.600 --> 24:30.840]  just opening the doors up and showing you what you can see on the surface. But there's
[24:30.840 --> 24:38.240]  a big wide world, a whole universe of surveillance out there. The entire infrastructure worldwide
[24:38.240 --> 24:46.200]  from Japan to the United States, from Germany to Chile, from South Korea to South Africa,
[24:46.200 --> 24:51.760]  from Moscow, Russia to Beijing, China.
[24:51.760 --> 24:57.560]  There is a unified global corporate government trying to take over what's left of nation
[24:57.560 --> 25:05.480]  states, trying to break down the family, trying to take over society and hardwiring the most
[25:05.480 --> 25:12.360]  lethal systems they can into the wireless grids. If there's a TV flicker rate that mesmerizes
[25:12.360 --> 25:18.120]  and lowers brainwaves, they go with that one in the global standardization and have international
[25:18.120 --> 25:19.120]  policy boards.
[25:19.120 --> 25:24.720]  If there's a particular wavelength of microwave relay from a cell phone that is particularly
[25:24.720 --> 25:31.000]  deadly tuned exactly to rattle DNA strands apart, they will globally meet and pay any
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.880]  amount of money to make sure that's adopted. You see, everything is tuned to be the most
[25:36.880 --> 25:43.200]  horrible possible. They have giant international boards to make sure that it's adopted with
[25:43.200 --> 25:49.600]  the BT corn and the BT wheat and the BT on and on, growing its own pesticide so you have
[25:49.600 --> 25:56.840]  unlimited cancer and organ failure and liver failure, pancreatic failure.
[25:56.840 --> 26:02.320]  They have international bodies for this standardization and doctors, they pay to say, babies need
[26:02.320 --> 26:10.400]  75% sugar. Everybody knows they need like 25%. And then it's all done to kill you, okay?
[26:10.400 --> 26:14.860]  Like shooting a black man up with syphilis when he comes in for a vaccine, okay? That's
[26:14.860 --> 26:19.680]  done to kill his butt and make it long and painful and to spread it. When they tell the
[26:19.680 --> 26:24.800]  troops take your mask off, we just blew up chemical plants, that's an order.
[26:24.800 --> 26:31.920]  That's on record, they wanted our troops to sit there and breathe that in. They want you
[26:31.920 --> 26:36.520]  dead, okay? You're like, well, why would they kill you? Because if they kill me, folks,
[26:36.520 --> 26:43.560]  it could disrupt the entire experiment. They have expected people like me to come along
[26:43.560 --> 26:49.480]  in their actuaries. And I've read about myself in books before I was born, not about me individually,
[26:49.480 --> 26:53.240]  but about people like Alex Jones, people like you.
[26:53.240 --> 27:01.320]  They talk about it. There'll be many gallant, beautiful souls in CFR meetings that try to
[27:01.320 --> 27:06.680]  resist us and don't see we're doing it for the betterment, and they'll have to be killed.
[27:06.680 --> 27:12.000]  That's H.G. Wells. We'll have to pay, and then he was re-quoted in the CFR. John just
[27:12.000 --> 27:13.000]  popped in my ear.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.560]  You ought to set it up, John, when you want to pop in on air where you're actually on
[27:15.560 --> 27:21.360]  air. I've told you guys a million times, I love it. It's just you're allowed to pop in,
[27:21.360 --> 27:25.320]  but do not do it where you're not on air, because then I'm just sitting there talking
[27:25.320 --> 27:29.680]  to the air. Thanks.
[27:29.680 --> 27:34.120]  The point is that I've read hundreds of books about their whole plan written 100 years ago,
[27:34.120 --> 27:42.720]  written 160 years ago, written 50 years ago, written 90 years ago. And it's not my opinion.
[27:42.720 --> 27:48.440]  You want me to sit here and give you the latest dribbles of news? What, how the telecoms have
[27:48.440 --> 27:50.520]  the CIA inside of them?
[27:50.520 --> 27:58.360]  And now they're spinning it that, they get service too. That's how they hide it. Or there's
[27:58.360 --> 28:03.880]  new smart street lights coming that give you free internet. And watch you and steal everything
[28:03.880 --> 28:07.920]  you're doing and have microphones on them. And it's like, yeah, big deal, Alex. It's
[28:07.920 --> 28:10.920]  a government program to give us free internet.
[28:10.920 --> 28:14.760]  From two years ago, it couldn't be true that there's not street lights up listening to
[28:14.760 --> 28:20.040]  us, even though it was admitted to, yes, we need that. It's free internet. No, you're
[28:20.040 --> 28:26.080]  paying for it with tax money. I'm just watching them roll this out to you. And people are
[28:26.080 --> 28:30.360]  so dumbed down. I see them commenting on info wars, not the majority, but some of them going,
[28:30.360 --> 28:31.360]  I don't understand it.
[28:31.360 --> 28:36.200]  Or I've seen news articles written going, what's he talking about? Why would the government
[28:36.200 --> 28:42.400]  want to kill us? We pay taxes on money they issue. They only use us paying taxes to be
[28:42.400 --> 28:47.560]  able to control the economy and pick winners and losers. Why is Alex claiming they want
[28:47.560 --> 28:51.960]  to give us cancer when I give all the evidence?
[28:51.960 --> 28:56.960]  They're like children. Well, I wouldn't do that. So nobody's gonna do that to me. Long
[28:56.960 --> 29:00.840]  segment coming up, but here's what's coming up. Document cam shot, please, for folks watching
[29:00.840 --> 29:07.480]  on prisonplanet.tv. FBI looks for leaks at foreign intelligence surveillance court. Look
[29:07.480 --> 29:10.560]  at the lie. It's all for domestic, but they call it foreign. The Federal Reserve is a
[29:10.560 --> 29:15.160]  foreign bank, so they call it Federal Reserve. Everything's a lie.
[29:15.160 --> 29:24.000]  It's like they have one of the White House spokesman come out and call it non-lethal
[29:24.000 --> 29:30.120]  lethal aid. The same guy that came up with kinetic action. He came up now with non-lethal
[29:30.120 --> 29:38.440]  aid. And now he calls it lethal. I have the transcript from the press conference, lethal
[29:38.440 --> 29:49.720]  non-lethal. I mean perfectly Orwellian. Lethal non-lethal aid.
[29:49.720 --> 30:00.800]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.800 --> 30:06.280]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[30:06.280 --> 30:11.560]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[30:11.560 --> 30:15.800]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[30:15.800 --> 30:21.000]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.
[30:21.000 --> 30:25.720]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[30:25.720 --> 30:30.800]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply
[30:30.800 --> 30:34.740]  with e Foods Direct. Be prepared before you need it. With nutrient-dense food, you can

[31:02.160 --> 31:06.880]  gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing
[31:06.880 --> 31:11.480]  a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When you're sleeping or away from
[31:11.480 --> 31:16.800]  home, who's watching out for intruders? Check out SimpliSafe. It's a new do-it-yourself

[33:22.440 --> 33:44.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. And I am your guest host here, Alex Jones, being
[33:44.320 --> 33:51.880]  sarcastic. Folks, there is a bunch of news that we're going to be getting to here today.
[33:51.880 --> 33:55.080]  And we are going to take your phone calls after our guest leaves us at the bottom of
[33:55.080 --> 34:01.200]  the next hour getting into weather weapons and other systems. But first off, I want to
[34:01.200 --> 34:08.800]  go to a trailer for a new film that I'm in called State of Mind that is available at
[34:08.800 --> 34:15.480]  infowarstore.com. And it is an important film to get into the mind warfare systems that
[34:15.480 --> 34:23.480]  are being used not just here but around the world and a general public that has been brought
[34:23.480 --> 34:28.120]  up within these different systems of programming and control. And so we'll go ahead and go
[34:28.120 --> 34:34.000]  to that trailer now. Here it is.
[34:34.000 --> 34:40.160]  Are we choosing our own paths, our own destiny, or has it been preselected for us?
[34:40.160 --> 34:49.280]  C.S. Lewis said, when training beats education, civilization dies.
[34:49.280 --> 34:53.760]  We need to always be cognizant of, as a free society, that information can be used as a
[34:53.760 --> 34:54.760]  weapon.
[34:54.760 --> 34:57.860]  Barrier to discovery is not ignorance. It's the illusion of knowledge.
[34:57.860 --> 35:01.280]  We are seen as nothing but biological androids.
[35:01.280 --> 35:08.720]  To gain control of education in America, not for a philanthropic purpose, but to change
[35:08.720 --> 35:11.600]  the thinking of the American people.
[35:11.600 --> 35:14.980]  From the time we're very young, we're taught to, you know, worship authority basically
[35:14.980 --> 35:17.680]  because that's our key to survival as young children.
[35:17.680 --> 35:23.240]  Discover the history, the present, and the future of mind control. From compulsory state
[35:23.240 --> 35:29.760]  education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage
[35:29.760 --> 35:32.120]  to the ideas that shape our actions.
[35:32.120 --> 35:37.940]  And the CIA scientists could actually film people who had been surreptitiously dosed
[35:37.940 --> 35:38.940]  with LSD.
[35:38.940 --> 35:42.860]  There's a brain entrainment process that takes place.
[35:42.860 --> 35:48.480]  That gives the government free reign to create whatever story or narrative it wants to create.
[35:48.480 --> 35:52.520]  Whatever the public face of something is, whatever they're talking about publicly, there's
[35:52.520 --> 35:54.600]  something else over here they're probably not looking at.
[35:54.600 --> 36:01.280]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would fully endorse, not
[36:01.280 --> 36:03.760]  only endorse, but demand a war.
[36:03.760 --> 36:11.080]  When you watch mainline establishment television, you are putting yourself in front of the barrel
[36:11.080 --> 36:12.880]  of a gun.
[36:12.880 --> 36:19.920]  Discover the history, the present, and the future of mind control, psychological warfare,
[36:19.920 --> 36:21.320]  brainwashing.
[36:21.320 --> 36:23.520]  Are we controlled and manipulated?
[36:23.520 --> 36:24.760]  You bet.
[36:24.760 --> 36:28.000]  That's mind control par excellence.
[36:28.000 --> 36:33.640]  Find out how deep the rabbit hole really goes with this new groundbreaking documentary film
[36:33.640 --> 36:38.440]  State of Mind, available exclusively at infowars.com.
[36:38.440 --> 36:42.680]  All right, folks, we are back live.
[36:42.680 --> 36:47.760]  And again, I get really wound up about this information because I know it's real.
[36:47.760 --> 36:52.380]  And I just see everybody going around in the world taking what the globalists are doing
[36:52.380 --> 36:55.180]  to us like it's no big deal.
[36:55.180 --> 37:03.400]  And the New World Order takes our adaptability and our capacity to put up with stuff.
[37:03.400 --> 37:08.760]  And they use that against us incrementally to get us conditioned to basically accept
[37:08.760 --> 37:09.760]  anything and everything.
[37:09.760 --> 37:12.880]  This is a very important film, it's very well done.
[37:12.880 --> 37:13.920]  I'm honored to be in it.
[37:13.920 --> 37:15.360]  It's got Colonel Shaffer in it.
[37:15.360 --> 37:21.120]  It's got author of The Creature from Jekyll Island, G. Edward Griffin.
[37:21.120 --> 37:25.000]  It's got a bunch of psychiatrists and psychologists and scientists in it.
[37:25.000 --> 37:29.720]  It's got great minds in it as well.
[37:29.720 --> 37:35.680]  Like the fellow that heads up No More Fake News, Mr. Rappaport.
[37:35.680 --> 37:42.720]  It's a very well done film and the first 5,000 people that get it will get a free copy of
[37:42.720 --> 37:49.320]  the DVD film The American Dream, 35-minute animated comical documentary.
[37:49.320 --> 37:55.560]  Great for the unwashed masses, the uninitiated masses who aren't aware of this information.
[37:55.560 --> 37:59.420]  It is a free film on the first 5,000.
[37:59.420 --> 38:01.320]  And they are going very, very quick.
[38:01.320 --> 38:05.280]  I've got 15,000 DVDs and Blu-rays.
[38:05.280 --> 38:09.080]  I've partnered with the filmmakers to help them really roll it out to the public in a
[38:09.080 --> 38:11.880]  big way because I think it's important.
[38:11.880 --> 38:16.160]  And so the first 5,000 orders will get the free American Dream DVD with it.
[38:16.160 --> 38:19.440]  And both of these make great gifts to wake people up and I'm very thankful to all of
[38:19.440 --> 38:25.680]  you that support us and go to Infowarsstore.com.
[38:25.680 --> 38:30.640]  And that's Infowarsstore.com and get both of the films.
[38:30.640 --> 38:34.720]  Now it starts shipping July 15th, but we have them in the warehouse right now.
[38:34.720 --> 38:43.320]  But the official release date is July 17th and we're gonna premiere the documentary State
[38:43.320 --> 38:48.360]  of Mind on the night of the 17th of July.
[38:48.360 --> 38:52.200]  We're gonna have the filmmakers and some of the people that are in the film here in Austin
[38:52.200 --> 38:57.000]  are flying them in to do like a special three, four-hour nightly news where we'll talk about
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.960]  the film, play the film, and then comment on the film afterwards.
[38:59.960 --> 39:05.600]  So it will premiere coming up and also be archived for everybody that's a prisonplanet.tv
[39:05.600 --> 39:07.600]  member then.
[39:07.600 --> 39:14.600]  All right, folks, I'm gonna play a piece that I talked about a few days ago that Jacari
[39:14.600 --> 39:23.720]  Jackson did dealing with the video game Rainbow Six, and this is one of the popular shoot
[39:23.720 --> 39:26.380]  them up military strategy games.
[39:26.380 --> 39:32.240]  And it's every new military game that's coming out, you fight American gun owners, tea partiers
[39:32.240 --> 39:35.000]  who are terrorists.
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.400]  And this is just the total branding.
[39:38.400 --> 39:41.060]  And it's lined up to then stage events and blame it on us.
[39:41.060 --> 39:43.120]  You can bet your bottom dollar.
[39:43.120 --> 39:44.120]  That's what's going on.
[39:44.120 --> 39:48.160]  And for this report, then I'll get to the latest on NSA, the latest on the G8, the latest
[39:48.160 --> 39:53.760]  on arming Al-Qaeda publicly over in Syria, and a lot more.
[39:53.760 --> 39:55.920]  And then our guest is gonna be joining us from London.
[39:55.920 --> 40:00.480]  But here is a piece that aired on Infowars Nightly News, so we're playing it here for
[40:00.480 --> 40:01.480]  the radio listeners.
[40:01.480 --> 40:07.120]  This is for the homes you foreclosed on, the bailouts you took.
[40:07.120 --> 40:16.960]  We are the true patriots.
[40:16.960 --> 40:21.400]  The long in development Rainbow Six Patriots has been confirmed for the next generation
[40:21.400 --> 40:22.840]  of gaming consoles.
[40:22.840 --> 40:25.280]  I'm Jacari Jackson with an Infowars news alert.
[40:25.280 --> 40:29.920]  Now, of course, the next generation of gaming consoles not only includes PlayStation 4,
[40:29.920 --> 40:34.840]  but also Xbox One, the same Xbox which is made by Microsoft, which has been alleged
[40:34.840 --> 40:38.440]  in the prison scandal which contains advanced tracking features in their unit.
[40:38.440 --> 40:41.040]  But that's not the point of this report.
[40:41.040 --> 40:47.040]  Rainbow Six is a highly decorated tactical team, as the Infowars.com article points out.
[40:47.040 --> 40:52.360]  Team Rainbow faces a new and very real threat called the true patriots, a highly trained,
[40:52.360 --> 40:57.100]  well organized revolutionary group that claimed the American government is irrevocably corrupted
[40:57.100 --> 41:00.640]  by greedy politicians and corporate special interests.
[41:00.640 --> 41:04.240]  The true patriots would do whatever it takes to reclaim their country.
[41:04.240 --> 41:09.280]  It goes on to say, players will face critical scenarios that will require them to make tough
[41:09.280 --> 41:13.600]  ethical decisions in order to stop this new breed of terrorist.
[41:13.600 --> 41:16.680]  We'll get to those tough ethical decisions in just one moment.
[41:16.680 --> 41:20.400]  And keep in mind, this is the statement from the game's own publisher, Ubisoft.
[41:20.400 --> 41:26.040]  Now, Infowars has well documented in numerous reports how the mass media demonizes militia
[41:26.040 --> 41:27.040]  groups.
[41:27.040 --> 41:30.160]  The real programming is happening with these shows like Founding Fathers where the guy
[41:30.160 --> 41:34.220]  that's pro-gun in Texas and leading the militia, he's really all kind of.
[41:34.220 --> 41:39.360]  Which fits into the whole narrative that it's white al-Qaeda or gun owners are really al-Qaeda.
[41:39.360 --> 41:43.400]  This game doesn't stop with just patriots, it also goes after survivalists, people who
[41:43.400 --> 41:45.840]  can skin a buck and run a trot line.
[41:45.840 --> 41:51.140]  Do exactly what we say or we will feel dress her like a deer.
[41:51.140 --> 41:53.680]  This game is a mirror for real life.
[41:53.680 --> 41:58.280]  Not only when conservatives and patriots are targeted by the IRS, but also when the Department
[41:58.280 --> 42:04.480]  of Homeland Security trains to fight the, quote, free American citizens in an exercise.
[42:04.480 --> 42:07.600]  And don't forget about the DHS's no hesitation targets.
[42:07.600 --> 42:12.560]  Now, back to those ethical choices, shooting police is nothing new in video games.
[42:12.560 --> 42:17.000]  But when you play a game such as Grand Theft Auto, the action is viewed as criminal and
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.680]  is often optional.
[42:18.680 --> 42:22.840]  But you'll see in this trailer for Rainbow Six, not only is the act of shooting police
[42:22.840 --> 42:26.000]  encouraged, it is mandated to advance in the game.
[42:26.000 --> 42:40.080]  And if you think that anything in this report has been taken out of context, listen to the
[42:40.080 --> 42:42.880]  game's former creative director, David Sears.
[42:42.880 --> 42:45.760]  Speaking of those terrorists, who are they now this time?
[42:45.760 --> 42:46.760]  They're homegrown.
[42:46.760 --> 42:47.980]  What does that mean exactly?
[42:47.980 --> 42:49.480]  They're homegrown.
[42:49.480 --> 42:54.260]  Domestic terrorism is a pretty significant threat facing the United States.
[42:54.260 --> 42:58.720]  And it's the idea that terrorists now look just like you or me.
[42:58.720 --> 43:03.160]  So it makes differentiating between, you know, friend and foe a lot more difficult, which
[43:03.160 --> 43:04.400]  is totally new for Rainbow.
[43:04.400 --> 43:08.600]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States?
[43:08.600 --> 43:09.600]  Who?
[43:09.600 --> 43:10.600]  founding five.
[43:10.600 --> 43:11.600]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[43:11.600 --> 43:12.600]  You mean George Washington?
[43:12.600 --> 43:24.180]  And we'll end with the December 2011 edition of Game Informer Magazine.
[43:24.180 --> 43:30.120]  It asks the question, you fought Nazi, Russian, North Korean and Middle Eastern threats.
[43:30.120 --> 43:39.960]  Rainbow Six Patriots ask, can you turn your weapon on your fellow countrymen?
[43:39.960 --> 43:44.940]  So targeting Americans, killing hostages and shooting police because using a radio was
[43:44.940 --> 43:46.360]  too inconvenient.
[43:46.360 --> 43:48.740]  That's the new Rainbow Six Patriots.
[43:48.740 --> 43:51.080]  And many real patriots have not taken this line down.
[43:51.080 --> 43:55.600]  They've gone to the Ubisoft Web site, their Facebook page and their Twitter page and voice
[43:55.600 --> 43:56.600]  their disgust.
[43:56.600 --> 43:59.640]  I'm Jackari Jackson with an info wars news alert.
[43:59.640 --> 44:10.320]  We will feel dress like a deer.
[44:10.320 --> 44:18.880]  Our government, our supposed media is putting out every drama, every sitcom, almost every
[44:18.880 --> 44:20.520]  shoot them up video game.
[44:20.520 --> 44:26.160]  The new enemy and you see this if you watch television, the new enemy, the worst people
[44:26.160 --> 44:28.640]  are gun owning militia people.
[44:28.640 --> 44:34.400]  And it's very racist because in all these TV shows and movies, they're white people.
[44:34.400 --> 44:40.880]  And then you see wrangle and all these other folks go up on television, Al Sharpton, black
[44:40.880 --> 44:47.880]  racist and say, it's the white southerners, but don't worry, we'll get their guns.
[44:47.880 --> 44:55.080]  I mean, actually say that, like it's a white person thing to own a gun.
[44:55.080 --> 45:00.480]  Then they have Fox News reporters and Fox Sports reporters both come out and say, you
[45:00.480 --> 45:06.000]  know the Ku Klux Klan is the NRA when it's the opposite.
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.120]  It was the Democratic Party and the Ku Klux Klan that passed the first gun laws in the
[45:10.120 --> 45:16.560]  South so blacks couldn't have guns.
[45:16.560 --> 45:20.000]  And anybody that knows basic history knows that it's so frustrating.
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.620]  They want us fighting with each other.
[45:22.620 --> 45:27.240]  But that doesn't mean then that you don't then have to respond, which then just adds
[45:27.240 --> 45:29.060]  to the whole deal.
[45:29.060 --> 45:33.000]  Because just because you're not racist if you're white or you're black, it doesn't matter
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.720]  cuz they put all this race war stuff out in the media.
[45:35.720 --> 45:39.620]  So black people think is that a racist white person and white people think is that a racist
[45:39.620 --> 45:41.840]  black person on and on and on.
[45:41.840 --> 45:44.720]  Or if you don't wanna pay for people to have their babies free and welfare and be above
[45:44.720 --> 45:53.600]  the law, well, you must be against Hispanics cuz that's the majority of the illegal aliens.
[45:53.600 --> 45:57.480]  It's so masterful what they've done, but it's also at the same time simple.
[45:57.480 --> 46:03.480]  And when you're awake to it, you know they're getting ready to stage something.
[46:03.480 --> 46:09.200]  And it turns out two months before the April 15th Patriots Day bombing in Boston, Boston
[46:09.200 --> 46:15.320]  Glove now reports, they had a drill planned for early next month.
[46:15.320 --> 46:21.800]  This was like what four months out then, this was two months before April.
[46:21.800 --> 46:28.520]  They had a plan to have backpack bombs carried out by a militia group against crowds of people
[46:28.520 --> 46:31.240]  in Boston.
[46:31.240 --> 46:34.200]  And we know they were doing a drill that day.
[46:34.200 --> 46:39.080]  And as best we can tell looking at the video of contractors and military people that were
[46:39.080 --> 46:47.240]  there, they were there taking part in that drill that was publicly scheduled for July.
[46:47.240 --> 46:51.120]  And they admit they had a drill two years ago of something similar, bombing the Boston
[46:51.120 --> 46:52.120]  Marathon.
[46:52.120 --> 46:56.400]  I mean, they had so many drills folks, so in case they got caught, it's just part of
[46:56.400 --> 46:57.400]  the drill.
[46:57.400 --> 47:00.020]  And then I told you, they're gonna kill FBI agents, they're gonna kill people that knew
[47:00.020 --> 47:02.960]  the Zarnav brothers and now they have.
[47:02.960 --> 47:06.760]  And it's gonna come out, they were on CIA payroll and sent to the caucuses to train
[47:06.760 --> 47:09.960]  cuz those terror groups are run by the CIA.
[47:09.960 --> 47:18.080]  That came out, it all came out, all of it, every stinking bit of it.
[47:18.080 --> 47:26.480]  And I don't know how in my personal life, with my family and everybody, how do I take
[47:26.480 --> 47:27.480]  time off?
[47:27.480 --> 47:28.480]  How do I relax?
[47:28.480 --> 47:33.360]  I mean, I'm asking you the listeners this because this gets me so upset knowing this
[47:33.360 --> 47:42.320]  is happening, that I'm too focused, I'm too serious, and quite frankly, it's exhausting.
[47:42.320 --> 47:48.040]  And so I apologize to everybody who listens and everybody that works with me if sometimes
[47:48.040 --> 47:52.080]  I'm just so serious, but it's like I can't help it.
[47:52.080 --> 47:55.640]  And I'm in a world of people that instead of being serious are the opposite, the general
[47:55.640 --> 47:56.640]  public.
[47:56.640 --> 48:03.080]  I mean, they've got Homeland Security paying for $2 million worth of paper targets of little
[48:03.080 --> 48:07.680]  kids called No More Hesitation.
[48:07.680 --> 48:11.960]  And the company said, no, we are training, Homeland Security wants them, these are to
[48:11.960 --> 48:12.960]  shoot.
[48:12.960 --> 48:15.800]  These aren't paper targets so you shoot the bad guy with the bag of money and the gun
[48:15.800 --> 48:17.840]  in his hand, you don't shoot the kids that pop up.
[48:17.840 --> 48:20.560]  This is to shoot the kids.
[48:20.560 --> 48:24.560]  And that was too hot for any media to handle.
[48:24.560 --> 48:28.240]  Kinda like it was too hot to handle four years ago, almost five years ago when we got the
[48:28.240 --> 48:32.600]  Homeland Security documents saying the number one terror threat is gun owners, conservatives
[48:32.600 --> 48:37.920]  returning veterans, Ron Paul supporters in the fetters.
[48:37.920 --> 48:41.040]  People didn't believe it, Ron Paul's office called me and they said, Alex, we know you
[48:41.040 --> 48:44.800]  don't make stuff up, but how'd you prove that was real?
[48:44.800 --> 48:49.040]  And I said, I called the phone numbers on it and the state police and the FBI, cuz that
[48:49.040 --> 48:53.200]  was two different documents, got very upset I had it and told me I wasn't supposed to
[48:53.200 --> 48:54.200]  have it.
[48:54.200 --> 48:58.760]  I said, it's real, I've seen these before, these graphics are Southern Poverty Law Center.
[48:58.760 --> 49:03.320]  This is just Southern Poverty Law Center with federal and state stamps on it.
[49:03.320 --> 49:08.660]  And then they sent a letter and got a response and came out and said, okay, it's real.
[49:08.660 --> 49:12.960]  And then now everybody's like, well, that's passÃ©, everybody knows that, listen, listen
[49:12.960 --> 49:13.960]  to me.
[49:13.960 --> 49:18.680]  They put weed killer in your stinking food, folks, that they know kills you, cuz they
[49:18.680 --> 49:20.080]  see you as a weed.
[49:20.080 --> 49:24.240]  They put fluoride in your water to hurt you and they know it's hurting you.
[49:24.240 --> 49:27.300]  They designed the GMO to poison you, okay?
[49:27.300 --> 49:31.440]  So it isn't up to me to come up with all the answers how to fix this, okay?
[49:31.440 --> 49:34.200]  I'm just here trying to wake people up.
[49:34.200 --> 49:42.160]  It's up to you to do something about this, we'll be right back.
[49:42.160 --> 49:45.720]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[49:45.720 --> 49:47.080]  That bears repeating.
[49:47.080 --> 49:50.600]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[49:50.600 --> 49:55.200]  And ProEM-1 daily probiotic cleanse is the key to digestive health.
[49:55.200 --> 50:00.420]  ProEM-1 is a powerful liquid probiotic, strong enough to cleanse, gentle enough to use every
[50:00.420 --> 50:01.420]  day.

[51:07.800 --> 51:10.720]  Always have a witness with Video-Cam.
[51:10.720 --> 51:14.920]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[51:14.920 --> 51:19.160]  counterfeit then carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[51:19.160 --> 51:20.160]  to service debt.
[51:20.160 --> 51:23.680]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[51:23.680 --> 51:26.960]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[51:26.960 --> 51:30.600]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary
[51:30.600 --> 51:31.600]  system.
[51:31.600 --> 51:34.480]  Call for your copy, 800-686-2237.
[51:34.480 --> 51:35.880]  It's time to understand the system.
[51:35.880 --> 51:40.960]  Call 800-686-2237, that's 800-686-2237.
[51:40.960 --> 51:45.040]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[51:45.040 --> 51:50.240]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us 20 billion in lost crops
[51:50.240 --> 51:51.240]  alone.
[51:51.240 --> 51:54.760]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[51:54.760 --> 51:58.620]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[51:58.620 --> 52:03.680]  The fact is you are, we all are, food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[52:03.680 --> 52:08.440]  You might not be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[52:08.440 --> 52:12.140]  the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.

[52:31.560 --> 52:38.120]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[52:38.120 --> 52:56.120]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[52:56.120 --> 53:00.000]  I'm here to tell you folks, you can't just punch out a reality and tell yourself, oh,
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.520]  this guy's crazy.
[53:02.520 --> 53:07.880]  Wouldn't you be a little crazy if you knew this stuff and it was true and you couldn't
[53:07.880 --> 53:11.120]  get other people to wake up fast enough?
[53:11.120 --> 53:16.120]  I mean, yeah, I've probably gone a little mad knowing all this info, but I think people
[53:16.120 --> 53:22.000]  that know about it and ignore it and don't care are really the crazy ones.
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.120]  And I've likened it to this a thousand times and I'll do it again.
[53:25.120 --> 53:29.200]  It'd be like in those movies which is based on a lot of true stories where a ship, a boat
[53:29.200 --> 53:33.440]  is capsized, an ocean liner, whatever the case is, and the water's coming up slowly
[53:33.440 --> 53:41.960]  and people are in it upside down and you've gotta swim 100 yards or whatever out through
[53:41.960 --> 53:47.800]  the dark, through the passageways to try to get out on top.
[53:47.800 --> 53:51.760]  And they've had cases where people just stay there and die cuz it's too scary to go try
[53:51.760 --> 53:53.480]  to swim out.
[53:53.480 --> 53:58.080]  And they just bang on the top of the ship until somebody finally gets to them.
[53:58.080 --> 54:02.780]  They just had an ocean liner recently do that and people stayed in there and drowned and
[54:02.780 --> 54:06.080]  didn't try to swim out.
[54:06.080 --> 54:13.000]  And this is like swimming 20 yards and we know the exit, we know what brings us back
[54:13.000 --> 54:14.000]  to liberty.
[54:14.000 --> 54:18.520]  This isn't 100 yards, 200 yards, something that's very hard to do but you don't have
[54:18.520 --> 54:22.200]  a choice, you've got to attempt it.
[54:22.200 --> 54:28.520]  This is, we're going to be destroyed if we don't wake up and get involved.
[54:28.520 --> 54:34.720]  I mean, look at this news here, folks, FBI looks for leaks at Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
[54:34.720 --> 54:36.200]  Corps.
[54:36.200 --> 54:43.640]  MOD serves news outlets with D notice, Ministry of Defense, of a surveillance leaks, that's
[54:43.640 --> 54:44.640]  right.
[54:44.640 --> 54:48.560]  They've ordered the Guardian and others not to report on now declaring national security.
[54:48.560 --> 54:52.080]  And they have similar things here that are classified in the US where they go threaten
[54:52.080 --> 54:53.880]  people and threaten to arrest them.
[54:53.880 --> 54:55.840]  So there you go, they're shutting it down.
[54:55.840 --> 55:01.280]  Snowden in online chat, NSA analysts can get anything they want, no kidding.
[55:01.280 --> 55:06.680]  DHS hopes to get same cyber spying powers as NSA, they already have it, folks.
[55:06.680 --> 55:09.920]  They just want to be able to use it in court now without warrants.
[55:09.920 --> 55:15.640]  So when they say they want it, it's like your kids already stole $20 out of your wallet
[55:15.640 --> 55:17.240]  and they ask, can I have $20 out?
[55:17.240 --> 55:19.840]  I mean, it's already been done.
[55:19.840 --> 55:24.400]  Continuing, we could not have carried out the bin Laden raid if it was on the front
[55:24.400 --> 55:25.400]  pages.
[55:25.400 --> 55:30.600]  The fake raid, this is incredible.
[55:30.600 --> 55:35.600]  Amazon's invasion of the CIA is a seismic shift in cloud computing.
[55:35.600 --> 55:42.760]  And this is a Wired magazine story where they say, the CIA is basing its servers inside
[55:42.760 --> 55:43.880]  Amazon systems.
[55:43.880 --> 55:52.280]  Folks, it's always been like this, NSA, CIA, DARPA, they're all in there.
[55:52.280 --> 55:56.660]  Some of their biggest profit centers in the telecoms and other related groups is from
[55:56.660 --> 55:58.780]  the server systems.
[55:58.780 --> 56:02.960]  That's all in the Cybersecurity Act that they didn't pass, but it's already implemented
[56:02.960 --> 56:04.160]  from four years ago.
[56:04.160 --> 56:09.600]  It's already in the Telecommunications Act of 96, but I've told you this about 50 times
[56:09.600 --> 56:10.600]  the last week.
[56:10.600 --> 56:14.320]  Here it is in the news again, okay, boom, see, I told you, all right?
[56:14.320 --> 56:19.960]  Here's another one, high tech street sign that plugs into social media instead of having
[56:19.960 --> 56:23.880]  Google cars driving around spying on you with the antennas.
[56:23.880 --> 56:28.240]  They're coming out with all these high tech street signs that double as wirelessly tracking
[56:28.240 --> 56:29.960]  you with cameras and microphones.
[56:29.960 --> 56:34.120]  Again, Wired magazine, so cutting edge, telling us about it.
[56:34.120 --> 56:35.840]  Paul Watson wrote about that two years ago.
[56:35.840 --> 56:39.240]  In fact, what's old is new, I'm gonna call Watson and say, do another article about the
[56:39.240 --> 56:43.780]  street signs that watch and listen to you, send it over to the media so we can get this
[56:43.780 --> 56:46.360]  out to people so they get the rest of the story.
[56:46.360 --> 56:51.600]  Continuing, James Clapper admits lying to the American people in the least untruthful
[56:51.600 --> 56:52.600]  manner possible.
[56:52.600 --> 56:53.600]  Isn't that sweet?
[56:53.600 --> 56:54.600]  That's another lie.
[56:54.600 --> 56:57.400]  And they got the transcript of him to Congress.
[56:57.400 --> 57:01.200]  Lying to you of your own good, yeah, yeah, right.
[57:01.200 --> 57:04.120]  NSA should come clean, says Ray Kelly, give me a break.
[57:04.120 --> 57:06.440]  That's rats leaving the sinking ship.
[57:06.440 --> 57:08.480]  That's just some of the news we've got on that front.
[57:08.480 --> 57:13.840]  I haven't even gotten into the huge Syria news, the economic news, aircraft carriers
[57:13.840 --> 57:17.960]  to guard the fake president at the Dublin Summit in Ireland.
[57:17.960 --> 57:20.680]  It's all coming up.
[57:20.680 --> 57:31.400]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[57:31.400 --> 57:36.520]  Cal Bend Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned
[57:36.520 --> 57:41.640]  real soap that is triple concentrated and made from the highest quality vegetable and

[58:34.400 --> 58:46.120]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[58:46.120 --> 58:50.960]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[58:50.960 --> 58:51.960]  You want answers?
[58:51.960 --> 58:54.080]  Well, so does he.
[58:54.080 --> 58:58.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[58:58.280 --> 59:08.480]  And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[59:08.480 --> 59:11.840]  Government is going completely rogue all over the Western world.
[59:11.840 --> 59:19.120]  The police now are trying to charge you administrative bills to respond to crimes in Canada, outside
[59:19.120 --> 59:25.480]  Toronto, they found a 400 year old dead native Aboriginal, a native American woman.
[59:25.480 --> 59:28.080]  And so they call the police, they're in their garden.
[59:28.080 --> 59:34.520]  Cops show up and then charge them $5,000 to respond because they had to get a coroner
[59:34.520 --> 59:36.180]  and an archeologist out there.
[59:36.180 --> 59:42.480]  When you pay taxes, all these fines and fees, that's the quote government service.
[59:42.480 --> 59:44.800]  So that's what they call privatization.
[59:44.800 --> 59:50.360]  I've got another WECT piece here that I'm gonna get to later in the hour.
[59:50.360 --> 59:54.320]  Eyewitnesses describe the terror of DWI checkpoint shooting.
[59:54.320 --> 59:59.520]  Now if cops see a glint of a pin in your hand, they shoot you, cuz it's all instinctive shooting
[59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.520]  like a video game.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:05.860]  So video games, Doom was invented for, is so you don't think, you just shoot people.
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:11.840]  And so now, every day you read about some old man, some old woman, some kid, kids on
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:16.360]  a bicycle, they see a gleam, it's their cell phone, cop shoots them.
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.760]  It's like, well, he felt threatened.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:22.280]  Well, I mean, potentially any citizen could hurt a cop, so why not execute everyone who's
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.280]  on a cop?
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.920]  I shouldn't give them ideas.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:31.800]  But this is described by the police just going crazy, just shooting into oncoming traffic,
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:38.040]  kinda like New York where they shot nine people and then blamed it on some guy they killed.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:42.760]  Or you got a telephone repair guy and his van breaks down, and so the police pull up
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.120]  in New York and shoot him.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.880]  I mean, it's really creepy.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:52.040]  And they tell him, do it, if you feel threatened anyway, kill everybody.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.920]  That's probably the only bad message I could say was in the Man of Steel.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:01.760]  I went and saw it last night, was this just SWAT teams everywhere, Lois Lane's done nothing,
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:05.600]  but the FBI jumps out and camouflage fatigues and shoves M16s in her face.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.160]  Just the idea of, we're gonna aim guns at you, we're going to do, for our safety, for
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.440]  your safety, just prisoner training.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:19.120]  Jared and Rosa Sheerden found themselves right in the middle of a shootout, and what should
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.160]  have been a routine DWI checkpoint.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.400]  They use these as really illegal checkpoints, if I like the Fourth Amendment.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.840]  Days after the dramatic shootout in Brunswick County, they are still shaken by what they
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.840]  saw.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:37.300]  Every cop turned around, started unloading like super trigger happy, as if their training
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:41.360]  was coming into full effect and they were being able to utilize it, said Sheerden.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:46.040]  Everybody was just blasting this car to pieces, it was absolutely terrifying.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:50.200]  They were stunned with what was happening as officers reportedly shot dozens of rounds
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.000]  in the direction of just oncoming traffic.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.520]  It's kind of like cars that didn't even match the description with women driving it.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:01.120]  With the Dorner thing, they would just shoot up, what was it, three vehicles.
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.560]  Just don't even match the description, it's women, let's just shoot them up, white women.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:10.680]  It's a white guy, I mean, it'd be bad enough if they shot up some black guy in a vehicle
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.000]  that looked the same.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.480]  But no, let's just shoot everybody up, cuz we're crazy.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:21.280]  Sheerden says he believes the officers acted with no regard for public safety, it was beyond
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.280]  reckless.
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.360]  I don't agree, I think they should shut up checkpoints, just randomly and kill everybody,
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.360]  for the children.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:30.040]  I couldn't believe it, these are professional people, professional officers.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.760]  And they're training, they're highly trained, and they're not supposed to do stuff like
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.760]  that.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:37.600]  Officials, not servants, with the sheriff's officer keeping a tight lift about the incident.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:43.880]  No one will tell us who shot the two suspects or what even led up to the shooting.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:47.920]  I couldn't understand why they wouldn't come out with an explanation as to what happened
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.080]  after seeing what they saw.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:54.440]  It looked like every officer did not follow protocol in any shape or form.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:58.680]  After surviving such a scary moment, both Jared and Rosar are thankful to spend Father's
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.000]  Day with their girl.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.380]  And it goes on, and it's just like, they're on administrative duty, paid vacation.
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:10.720]  And we've had four cases of this the last few months, I guess in the last six months
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.560]  or so in Austin, just where they pull somebody over.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:19.640]  And the guy has a belt buckle or a pin or a pin in their hand, and cop shoots him.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:24.160]  I almost got killed by an Austin cop when I was still in high school, a senior in high
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.040]  school driving home.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:30.320]  My mother had asked for frozen yogurt, I drove up to get her some, I'm driving back.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.360]  Cop pulls me over, said I was speeding.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:38.520]  Sees my weight belt in the front seat, pulls the gun out and jams it in my head, and almost
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:41.520]  blew my head off over the weight belt.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.400]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.600]  pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:53.720]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:57.880]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:03.600]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.640]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:12.960]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:17.280]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and

[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.840]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:57.380]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:58.600]  on earth.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:03.440]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being

[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.960]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.360]  shadow state.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:15.400]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:21.560]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.680]  citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.160]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.200]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.200]  It's here.

[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:33.000]  But that's a real jump point, a launch point right there on the site.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.680]  We're going to our guests for the next 45 minutes or so, then your phone calls.
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:43.000]  Here in just a moment to look at world weather patterns, one of the top, was it astrophysicist
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.840]  and meteorologist.
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.800]  Most meteorologists don't look at the sun and the moon.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:48.800]  He does.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:49.800]  That's why he's world renowned.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.720]  You had a chance to run back into him when I was in London, so Pierce Corbin joining
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:53.720]  us in just a moment.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.860]  But first, let me show you some Orwellian news here.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:04.620]  This is the weekly standard from a transcript of the Pentagon slash White House press conference.
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:12.760]  And it says, make that non-lethal Freudian slip a corrected transcript just sent out
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.240]  by the White House of Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.680]  He's the one that has the fiction writing degree, who seems to be running the White
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.320]  House now.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:28.160]  Comments to reporters yesterday includes this, Mr. Rhodes, it's an ironic question because
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:32.500]  it frequently comes at the other way.
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:35.520]  That the Europeans are doing more than we, talking about Syria.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:41.480]  In fact, I think on Syria, as a general matter, we have been a leading provider of humanitarian
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:47.040]  assistance on lethal, non-lethal assistance.
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:54.160]  And we are taking the steps to provide support for the military opposition.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.160]  So he admits it's military opposition.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.280]  For two years, they've been giving him missiles and heavy weapons.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.640]  They're now just admitting that.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:09.640]  And we've got reports today of service to air missiles, truck conveyed howitzers, rocket
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:14.440]  launchers, and he first called it lethal, non-lethal assistance.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:17.780]  This is the guy that said, no, this is a peaceful mission in Libya.
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:23.280]  These are kinetic military actions blowing up whole apartment buildings to back up all
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.480]  kind of forces.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:27.440]  This is the guy that calls it kinetic military action.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:30.440]  Now it's lethal, non-lethal, but that was too Orwellian.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:34.240]  So they sent another transcript out, taking the word lethal out, even though that's what
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.240]  he said.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.240]  So it's lethal, non-lethal.
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:41.240]  So I guess you can go kill whoever you want, and when the cops show up and they're dead,
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:47.400]  say you used a hatchet or a baseball bat, or whatever, or maybe a dagger, and say it's
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:55.480]  lethal, non-lethal, it's a kinetic action, do I get a peace prize here?
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:58.960]  They call drugging, trying to drug half the school children in America, that's their goal,
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.000]  the New Freedom Initiative.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.680]  They call the Patriot Act, the Patriot Act.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.720]  They call the FISA Court, the foreign intelligence.
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.280]  It spies domestically.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.800]  It's all inverted.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.200]  And here's the good news.
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:17.960]  Kevin Booth called me up, a filmmaker, old friend of mine, used to live in Austin, and
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:21.840]  he said, Bloomberg promised me it was a friendly piece when they asked me all those personal
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.840]  questions.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.840]  They lied to me.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.400]  And I said, of course they did, Kevin, he called me last night.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.620]  I said, of course they lied to you, Kevin.
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:32.640]  I told them I knew it was a hit piece and they lied and we're all fake.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.100]  I said, that's why they have low approval ratings.
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:38.160]  That's why their readership is down across the board, mainstream media.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.400]  I said, they're destroying themselves.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.440]  They still carry out the same old tricks, but it's not in a vacuum.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:47.080]  So here's a few more of those and we're going to our guest.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:53.520]  First Europeans and NATO heavy arms for Syria, rebels, Russian reprisals expected.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.340]  And it goes on to talk about how the US has landed and it's moving in out of Turkey into
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.340]  the country.
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:01.380]  This is the Israeli news.
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:06.200]  Just all these different weapons systems that they're giving them, 120 millimeter cannons
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:15.920]  mounted on jeeps, anti-air and surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank missiles, recoilless 120
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.720]  millimeter cannons.
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:24.040]  And hey, I think the cannons deserve a peace prize.
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:28.060]  But again, the UN said four years ago at the Copenhagen Summit calling for world government
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:34.660]  tax on every one except the globalist, a $100 trillion tax by the way, show them $100 trillion.
[01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:40.400]  They called for it a few months later at Davos, $100 trillion in credit needed and that means
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:45.040]  to the private banks and that means taxing use where the money comes from.
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:48.920]  They said the sun does not affect weather.
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:54.200]  They had a vote at the UN, politicians and scientists voted.
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:57.200]  There it is, world needs 100 trillion more credits, says World Economic Forum.
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:01.720]  That was first in the Copenhagen document months before that.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.960]  And they had a vote saying the sun doesn't affect the Earth.
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:07.840]  It doesn't affect Mars either, even though they admit that's what makes its ice caps
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.120]  get bigger or smaller.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.260]  I will assure you folks, we'd be at absolute zero if it was not for the sun.
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:16.400]  And I know they'll say that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:19.560]  They say mothers don't need to breastfeed their children, even though it makes the brain
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:22.080]  much smaller.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:27.140]  It's not a conspiracy theory that your baby needs what you have that's designed for them.
[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:31.920]  It's not a conspiracy to say that the sun is what heats the Earth and is the main driver
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.560]  of climate change.
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:37.160]  Even at Al Gore says it isn't, it is and I know that's extreme.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:39.600]  I understand I'm wild here.
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.360]  You know, I told you the NSA spying on you.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:51.460]  Continuing, we're gonna get more into video Syrian teen rebels hail 9-11 attacks and say
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:54.240]  they're going to blow America up again.
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.000]  And now even USA Today admits our government is funding Al-Qaeda.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:05.880]  That is the main force launching military operations in Syria.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:10.640]  So two years after we told you, that's now admitted.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.000]  That is just some of what's gonna be coming up.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:18.680]  Now we are joined by, ladies and gentlemen, Piers Corbin is an owner operator of Weather
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:26.280]  Action and he has incredible accuracy that even mainstream media has admitted.
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:30.880]  Sometimes nine months to a year out on major weather cycles.
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:35.380]  He has an honors degree in physics at Imperial College London and studied astrophysics at
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:36.520]  Queen Mary College.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:45.400]  Corbin also has a long history of just incredibly accurate predictions dealing with the weather
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.040]  and he is a heretic as well.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:54.600]  He says the sun and the moon as a lensing effect is one of the main drivers of our climate.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:58.720]  Of course, any idiot knows that but he scientifically quantifies it.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:04.240]  And so he joins us to break down the latest hype where it's not global warming now, it's
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.880]  just climate change period is not natural.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.000]  Just another giant hoax.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.080]  Of course, the only thing that is constant is change and he's, as I said, a meteorologist
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.360]  and astrophysicist.
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.760]  He's here to break this down with us.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:20.920]  We're going to break here in a few minutes, Piers, but I appreciate you joining us.
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.360]  What's on your radar first and foremost today?
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:32.440]  Well, the warmest in the shape of the UK Met Office of what they call the climate summit
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:37.160]  today where they were going to discuss why are all these changes happening and is it
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.160]  to do with CO2.
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:44.600]  Now, a number of people told them we should be invited, Weather Action should be invited
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.160]  because we have the answers to many of these questions.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:53.520]  Now, of course, they didn't invite us and we put out a statement saying, well, of course,
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:17:00.400]  this meeting is just a scam to raise the profile of climate change nonsense during the G8 summit,
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:04.680]  which is also being held in the United Kingdom at the same time.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:12.200]  And well, we've had interesting reception and had a debate on one BBC radio channel
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.120]  on this matter earlier today, which was quite amusing.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:21.640]  Well, all the polls show that the global warming, anthropogenic crowd, manmade crowd has been
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:24.120]  discredited with the public, but they're still in charge.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:28.120]  They're just moving forward with all their carbon taxes.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.360]  Congress won't pass a law.
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.120]  So Obama just just does it.
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:32.960]  Of course, the Chinese are exempt.
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.720]  So all our jobs go there.
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:39.320]  How do you expect this to end up as the public wakes up, but the authoritarians move forward
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:44.960]  and they give lies and lies and their only answers are, on this radio show, he just said,
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:53.120]  oh, you are an astrologer and you are a conspiratorial nutter, you know, it just went on like that.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.840]  And I said, look, tell me the science, tell me the science, because I'd already stated,
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:05.480]  look, we use these low solar activity changes, the moon to predict weather a long time ahead
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.960]  and you guys can do nothing.
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.520]  So he didn't want any of that.
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:15.160]  He just was obviously the moon affects the tides, but it also blocks the solar winds.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:16.160]  That's right.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.560]  And the most important effect is how it affects the solar winds.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.560]  It does have a tide.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.560]  And you graduated with honors.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:21.560]  Secondly, if you like.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.560]  Yeah.
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:23.560]  Yeah.
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:24.560]  Well, we've got to go to break.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:28.080]  We're going to come back and give you the floor to break down this, but I mean, it's
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:31.480]  on record the moon is manipulating weather and that the sun is.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:32.480]  I mean, come on.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.960]  And you are a astrophysicist, not an astrologer.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:39.320]  And they know that, but they're, they think their audience is dumb.
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:42.640]  And that's why the BBC does that.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:47.560]  With health threats on the rise, such as West Nile virus, MRSA, and now the new bird flu

[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:51.320]  All right, Alex Jones here.
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:56.840]  Here's Corbin, meteorologist, astrophysicist is our guest and he was just on national BBC
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:01.040]  radio and they were calling him an astrologer and I've seen that in criticism of him when
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:05.500]  like major newspapers have admitted that he's accurately predicted whether sometimes a year
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:11.340]  out off of a solar activity and then there's all these other scientists I have on and it's
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:16.560]  admitted that the sun by mainline scientists is the main driver of climate.
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:22.160]  But then all the global warming people run this hoax and go, everyone agrees the sun
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.280]  doesn't affect our climate.
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:25.980]  By the way, you can pull that up.
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:31.120]  The UN says, the UN votes and says the sun does not affect climate because they don't
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.400]  want it to be something outside.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:38.240]  They want to make you guilty for it and now England's had some really unusual weather.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.520]  I thought it's always supposed to be rainy there.
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:45.460]  When I was there, it was quite sunny and they spin any event, a wildfire, anything as a
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:50.080]  reason to pay Al Gore money for Obama to raise carbon taxes, which he's paid himself.
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:51.080]  Here's Corbin, you've got the floor.
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:55.320]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:24:01.280]  Get in for people what the main drivers are in a simple way, why the moon, why the sun
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.280]  are important.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:03.280]  Okay.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.760]  First of all, I want to say it was great to meet you over in England because, you know,
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:10.400]  people need to shake up there and you were certainly doing that.
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:11.960]  Well, it was great to meet you, sir.
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.600]  Thanks for coming out to our Bilderberg protest.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.600]  That's right.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:15.600]  It was fun.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:16.600]  Right.
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:17.600]  So what are the drivers of climate?
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:24.600]  It is solar activity modulated by the moon and there's other modulations in the atmosphere
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:29.880]  to do with stratospheric winds and so forth, but these are also driven by the sun.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:39.520]  So when we understand the details of cycles, quasi-cycles and certain predictability equations,
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:44.240]  we know when to look in the past for when there's likely weather for the future and
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:49.040]  that makes it possible to give long-range, many months ahead, sometimes a year ahead
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:56.000]  quite detailed forecasts, including for the USA and we've had some very significant successes.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:02.880]  For example, during the 10th and 12th you had a lot of storms all over the place, which
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:08.560]  was exactly in the time window we said and if people go on our website they can see pictures
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.560]  of that.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:14.080]  So, of course, the next thing is, well, okay, we're doing all this, so why aren't they interested?
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:18.680]  And, of course, the reason they're not interested is because they have a scam, which is to con
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:24.560]  the world that it's all caused by mankind and therefore you've got to pay more taxes
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:28.200]  and be charged more for energy and food and everything.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:32.680]  So the question must be really, how is this going to collapse?
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:33.680]  Will it collapse?
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.680]  And I think there's three things to notice.
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:44.200]  One is they have no scientific answers, so they just do name calling and they call me
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:50.360]  an astrologer and a conspirator and just nonsense and I just said to him, look, give me the
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.360]  science and he didn't give any.
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:59.200]  So when people see it's a con, they will react, but the main thing is that when the costs
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:08.080]  go up and up, people will just say no and right now we're paying 25% extra on energy
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:13.000]  costs, electricity and gas, to pay for those stupid wind farms that they're having, which
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  are just killing birds.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  I mean, you know, it's a monstrosity and people will come up and eventually say no and I've
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:28.040]  been saying on the radio when I can that a party in Britain which says no to this global
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:34.400]  warming nonsense will win the next general election and, you know, there is a mounting
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:44.320]  understanding and I think it's worth spelling out to listeners three very specific scams
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:47.040]  which they're changing the facts, you see.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.040]  Now one is about carbon dioxide.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:56.880]  They say, oh yes, we've got carbon dioxide is the highest ever and it's reached 4.04%
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:59.640]  which they grandly call 400 parts per million.
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:05.440]  Well, in fact, if you do proper measurements on a systematic way, the same way as the recent
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:10.320]  measurements as opposed to looking at ice cores which lose CO2 by diffusion, if you
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:15.120]  do proper scientific measurements and they had been done in the past but the documents
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:23.360]  were largely suppressed, it's clear that twice in the last 200 years the 0.04% figure was
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:24.360]  exceeded.
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:31.600]  So the idea that this is new is nonsense and that completely takes away their idea that
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:37.840]  there isn't even more CO2, there's actually just the same amount of CO2 and second thing
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:46.360]  is on temperatures they play a scam with ice cores where in fact they don't admit that
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:56.000]  first of all the sea warms up and then CO2 levels go up so on average over long periods.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:03.760]  That's right, Al Gore moved the graph and put carbon dioxide first and then heat goes
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:10.760]  up but the truth was the graph that I've seen was that heat goes up and then CO2 goes up,
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:11.760]  correct?
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:12.760]  Exactly right.
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:19.560]  And the third thing is ice in the arctic, they keep on going on about ice in the arctic

[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:48.120]  yeah, I do and I go, I'm gonna be on 590 or I'm gonna be on 90.1, I'm gonna be on this
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:52.400]  local station in like 30, 40 minutes, tune in, I'm covering some really important info
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:59.760]  or I'll be in the grocery store, sometimes I bring the guy's lunch before the show or

[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:10.200]  you get it done, so please tell folks to tune in to your local AM and FM stations, it's
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.200]  so important.
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:16.360]  Now, going back to our guest who is really, he's been on before and I've pulled up all
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:21.400]  the mainstream news articles about the stunning predictions, I'm pumping our guest up, I want
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:26.440]  you to know this guy's proving those we talked about but it turns out it's what the old farmers
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:32.520]  knew, even before they could study the sun, people hundreds of years ago knew that sunspots
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:37.420]  when they first had telescopes were associated with thunderstorms and now they know, I mean
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:42.960]  now when I hear about a record flare hitting the hemisphere I'm in, with all those particulate
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:46.160]  coming in, I know there's gonna be big thunderstorms tonight, it can be a clear sky and there'll
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:51.400]  be thunderstorms and they now admit that, so this is mainline science but they play
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:57.600]  on the public's ignorance about the sun and what it does and then how the moon, whether
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:04.160]  it's blocking the sun, not the light but the particles or whether it's not, plus it also
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:08.960]  affects the tides, so I know you're getting into their frauds but our audience knows that.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:13.520]  Well, the reason I like getting you on, Mr. Corbin, as an astrophysicist and a meteorologist
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:18.880]  award-winning, graduating with honors and then just in the last, whatever, three, four
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:24.200]  decades trailblazing so much of the old knowledge with the new knowledge that just is constantly,
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:28.920]  as I read the scientific publications, even mainline scientific publications admit all
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:33.760]  this, but it's when you tune into the socialist news, they act like it doesn't exist and then
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:39.200]  if you go back to every culture, the Druids, the Babylonians, the Mesoamericans, they
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:43.040]  would be a priest class who figured out when solar and lunar eclipses were gonna happen,
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:48.400]  they would always say, give me the best hut, the best temple, your daughters, the best
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:53.480]  food or the snake god will eat the sun tomorrow and then they don't give him the best daughters
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:57.680]  and the best food so the snake god eats it, they all beg, alright, sacrifice one of your
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:02.600]  kids and the snake god will spit the sun out, that's the Aztecs but it was the same everywhere
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:11.600]  basically, you know, the goblin god is eating the sun or the moon, do what I say or it won't
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:16.240]  come back, they're the ones saying there's bad weather, pay the Rothschilds and Rockefellers
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:25.960]  money on the carbon exchange or you're all dead or a Mongolian storm blew into Europe,
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:31.880]  Eastern Europe, look, red dust in the sky, we're all dead, pay Al Gore money when I've
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:37.280]  read history and I've read about Mongolian storms blowing into Europe and Russia for
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:42.040]  thousands of years, I mean, sometimes I'll come out, my car is covered with dirt and
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:49.600]  I'll go read and it's a northern Mexican desert storm or it's a Mongolian storm or it's amazing
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:54.680]  how they do this for just a lay researcher, it's such an incredible fraud so get into
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:39:00.120]  the sun, the moon, what's really going on with the climate and give us the weather forecast,
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:03.040]  some of the things you're looking at around the world, what to look at, people can also
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:07.400]  find out more at weatheraction.com, Piers Corbin.
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:13.080]  Yes, well, I think the main message you've got to understand for the next few years is
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:17.080]  they're going to carry on lying and they're going to get more exposed and we think they've,
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:22.680]  well, we're sure they've actually inflated real world temperatures by about half a degree
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:29.640]  so their so-called warming doesn't exist and what we're seeing in the Arctic is big fluctuations
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:36.040]  in amount of ice, not reductions and this is what happened during the last mini ice
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:42.640]  age and this is where we are the start of now, another mini ice age which means the
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:50.520]  jet stream fluctuates more wildly, there are colder winters in the USA and Europe and Britain,
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:58.680]  wetter summers especially in England and France and there will be generally speaking a crisis
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:02.400]  in the world agriculture because there will be more wetter...
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:09.200]  Alright, but let me stop you, Piers, let me stop you briefly because you went to break
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:12.520]  and I just remembered you were trying to make the point about ice caps, we've shown the
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:17.080]  satellite footage of a year time lapse of the north and southern poles obviously have
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:22.880]  their, explain that they aim a camera in time lapse and show it shrinking in the spring
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:27.760]  and summer but they don't show it growing again in the winter, this is natural.
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:32.440]  Yeah, that's right, it's completely natural, everything that's happening now is completely
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:37.640]  natural and in fact, the only thing that's out of the ordinary if you like is the wider
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:44.480]  fluctuations and these are completely explicable in terms of the jet stream being wildly oscillating
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:50.080]  which happens when you have a longer jet stream which is further south and it's able to oscillate
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:56.840]  more which is a characteristic of a mini ice age and nothing to do with CO2 or their complete
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:57.840]  con.
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:02.680]  Now, they're scared of having us at any meeting saying this so they had their climate summit
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:06.880]  claiming they were going to talk about everything but the last people they wanted along were
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:10.320]  the likes of us to actually explain what is happening.
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:15.200]  Okay, so continue, break down what's really going on, talk about the sun, talk about the
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:17.160]  moon, how those work together.
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:25.760]  Right, the general decline of solar activity leads when the moon is in the right place
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:32.360]  I suppose and then repeatedly in the right place, encourages the jet stream to move further
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:39.280]  south and also wave around a lot more and that is what gives us what we call this mini
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:45.960]  ice age weather and you know, we make specific predictions based on the details and the general
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:51.880]  thing to note is that we are at the start of a mini ice age and you see, it's really
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:59.000]  important to understand this, it is going to put up the cost of food and energy because
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:04.880]  there's going to be more problems in agriculture whereas what we need therefore is cheap food.
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:11.640]  Now, all the policies of the warmest are to increase energy cost and increase food cost
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:13.080]  which is completely madness.
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:16.080]  They are pointing the world in the wrong direction.
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:18.400]  That's why they have to be opposed absolutely.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:23.960]  I mean, it's not just a little academic argument, it's a life and death question for millions
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:28.600]  of people who will be starving if their policies continue.
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:32.760]  And by the way, Lord Monckton's broken down the numbers and the UN even had to admit it,
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:37.920]  they were going to have it right at double the carbon cuts for Africa, Latin America
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:42.520]  and Asia that the West was going to have to make even though they sold it as an anti-Western
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:44.920]  socialist idea.
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:48.800]  If they put in the carbon taxes they've talked about which they're trying to phase in even
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:54.200]  though governments aren't passing it, Monckton estimated in a decade it will kill a billion
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:56.460]  people.
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:59.800]  Folks don't know that 30 plus million people starve to death a year worldwide.
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:02.800]  There's people on the edge, you see.
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:11.120]  There were food riots in Mexico when they started burning food as biofuels because the
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:16.680]  maze was being burned, you see, and all sorts of stuff was being burned so prices went up.
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:20.680]  Now, this is still happening and I'm going to carry on.
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:25.000]  So Monckton, I don't know the figures, but I mean, quite possibly there's a lot of people
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:31.880]  in the world on the margins and they are being effectively killed by these mad people who
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:36.920]  are, well, just want excuses to grab money off everybody.
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:43.480]  Well, the IMF got leaked in 2002, has actuaries shut up to where they actually control the
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:46.160]  police contracts and military contracts.
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:52.720]  They plan to make money off of all these third-world countries rioting from Brazil to Turkey because
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:58.560]  people can't pay for food and then they actually use that to get the country even in more debt
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:43:59.560]  as well.
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:00.560]  So it's all premeditated.
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:01.560]  Yes, yes.
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:02.560]  Yes, quite right, quite right.
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:10.960]  I mean, what is needed is policies which can enable economies to grow, not these, well,
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:15.560]  they're just robbery, robbery policies, which doesn't help.
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:17.760]  But as long as you call it liberal, it's trending.
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:20.080]  You've got to work to make an economy grow.
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:23.080]  You can't be prevented from working, you know, it's insane.
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:24.800]  Well, that's the post-industrial model.
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:26.480]  They publicly said that's their plan.
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:30.200]  Meanwhile, the insider corporations are all exempt so then they take over.
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:32.840]  It's basic business for them using government.
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:38.160]  Now, but specifically as an astrophysicist, I mean, so much of this, by mainline research,
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:44.280]  they know obviously the heat of the sun, solar radiation, but how is the sun manipulating
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:48.280]  our weather in other ways and what does the moon do?
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:49.280]  Oh, okay.
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:57.000]  Well, the particles from the sun connect in different ways to the magnetic field of the
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.720]  earth and enter the atmosphere and they're charged particles.
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:09.680]  So they will, by the way they're moving in the solar wind, which is affected by the level
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:16.240]  of the, well, where the moon is, are up and down compared with the plane in which the
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:20.400]  earth moves around the sun, for example, and where it is precisely.
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:26.440]  That affects the solar wind and therefore affects circulation and also the way therefore
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:30.040]  in which the jet stream moves or doesn't move.
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:31.040]  So that's one factor.
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:39.480]  And the other factor is the activity of weather fronts certainly seems to increase or decrease
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:44.600]  according to some of our parameters, which are based on increases of solar activity.
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:50.400]  So we have these red spike periods like the 10th to 12th of June I mentioned was an R5
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:51.400]  period.
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:56.320]  And we said in advance that means that anything standard meteorology says from a couple of
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:02.520]  days ahead is going to need to be magnified under the worst storms and that was in fact
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:03.520]  the case.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:08.160]  So not only did the storms come when we said from a long time ahead, they were also, once
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:12.320]  standard meteorology had seen them coming, they were also more intense than standard
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.480]  meteorology had said they would be.
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:20.440]  And if people go on our news section, you will see a PDF describing just what happened.
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:25.640]  Now I as a layman, but going off mainline research, have just drawn an image of the
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:30.120]  sun with the moon and the earth and I'm showing how solar radiation comes in when the moon
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:36.040]  is aligned with the sun and the earth and how it causes a deflection pattern.
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:43.800]  Then obviously then there's also gravitational waves that are affecting the oceans and cycles
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:45.160]  and birds and everything else.
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:47.680]  So the moon also has that effect.
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:53.280]  What is it called the effect of the moon when it's say on the other side of the planet from
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.160]  the sun not blocking rays versus when it is in front of it?
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:04.040]  Well, we don't have a name for that, obviously you've got new moons and full moons in terms
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:10.720]  of the light, but what we have to think about is not just this blob of earth, you've got
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:17.280]  to think of a great big volume around that which spreads out to three times the radius
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:26.040]  of the earth, which is a big magnetic field and that is where the earth's magnetic field
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:30.880]  is contained and around that the solar wind blows and some of the solar wind enters into
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:34.800]  the earth's magnetic field and then the earth's magnetic field is stretched out in a long
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:41.720]  tail called the magnetotail and the moon crashes through this magnetotail every revolution
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:44.780]  and where it crashes through is of importance.
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:47.640]  So as it comes through it makes waves.
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:50.640]  Intercepting the solar wind is also important.
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:55.680]  So as the moon comes through it causes all sorts of its own coriolis storms?
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:57.160]  Oh sure, lots of things happen.
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:02.080]  I mean I've got some friends in Russia and I said to my friend Kiril, I said Kiril look,
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:08.080]  just ask your mates, does the, when the moon enters the magnetotail, does anything happen?
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:14.360]  And he came back and said no, they all said it doesn't, no, nothing happens and I said
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:19.400]  well just have more of a look and he came back to me and said yes, yes, yes, they now
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:21.400]  admit something does go on.
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:28.680]  So you see the stuff going on which people haven't looked at before and those things
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:34.280]  are, we don't understand how it all works, we just got some ideas, those things are definitely
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:35.280]  changing weather.
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:39.400]  Sure, well it's almost like if you have your water faucet on but the sun's blasting out
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:40.400]  all sorts of stuff.
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:44.440]  Yes, yes, the other thing is there's a lot of stuff we can't see, there's magnetic fields
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:48.960]  changing all the time, there's particles swirling around in them in different ways, there's
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:49.960]  a...
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:52.280]  Sure but if you stick your hand under the water faucet...
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:54.920]  ...bad ways depending on magnetic fields and so forth.
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:59.240]  Sure but if you would stick a finger under the faucet it deflects it and makes it change
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:04.560]  and then there's so many other things going on here but obviously the ancients knew that
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:08.320]  depending on what the moon did and the sun that that would have different effects.
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:16.520]  Well the vikings knew that if there were aurora then storms would follow and that was always
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:17.520]  the case.
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:20.960]  I mean sometimes it was too cloudy to see the aurora but if ever they saw aurora they
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:26.120]  knew for sure there was going to be storms coming within, you know, a day.
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:29.200]  And that's because particles are coming through forming nuclei, correct?
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:36.480]  Essentially yes, particles will do many things but some of them will form, yes, they'll nucleate
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:38.480]  by formation.
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:41.640]  Alright, give us a weather forecast when we come back, Pierce Corp.

[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:19.560]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes

[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:24.080]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:27.400]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:31.680]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:46.960]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply in 2011 storms
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:51.240]  and floods raged across the US costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:55.280]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:59.140]  You may think out of sight out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:04.200]  The fact is you are we all are food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[01:52:55.840 --> 01:53:16.320]  Okay, Pierce, so generally for Europe, Airstrip One, Oceania, the UK area, and North America,
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:19.760]  what is your weather forecast short term, midterm, long term?
[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:22.640]  In general, what are we seeing and what is the sun doing right now?
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:30.400]  Well, the sun is generally very low activity, and then sometimes there are quite severe
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:39.240]  births in that low period, and that certainly causes sudden changes and big swings in the
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:46.640]  jet stream, which gives us these very contrasty weather, which we have been having, and that's
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:50.600]  the, you know, later in the summer in Britain there's going to be more very heavy rain and
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:56.280]  floods, and some parts of the US summer is going to have some more rain, and then a later
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:02.960]  part in the east probably some big heat waves, but, you know, none of these things are good
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:10.480]  for agriculture, and the general trend in the years is lower temperatures for the whole
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:18.040]  of the temperate zone and wetter summers and colder winters, which means food prices go
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:19.040]  up.
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:25.040]  So the warnings about food prices you've been carrying are, you know, very apt, and we just
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:30.240]  have to really attack the politicians for leading the world in the wrong direction,
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:38.160]  because they're putting their selfish personal interests, you know, to rip people off ahead
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:42.000]  of what is actually needed.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.040]  Amazing.
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:49.120]  Any other key tidbits that people should be aware of?
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:55.480]  Yes, well, the scams will carry on, and the key thing is to say to these people, where's
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:57.840]  the evidence for what you claim?
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:06.760]  And hold politicians to account, demand evidence-based science, and that we take measures to prepare
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:11.760]  for many ice age effects, and there's two things to do there.
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:20.720]  One is make use of detailed long-range forecasts, and two is to bring down food prices and end
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:29.000]  all these crazy thieving tax plans to make people pay for something which is in fact
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.800]  a delusional nonsense.
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:36.360]  All right, Piers Corbin from Weather Action, thank you so much for spending time with us,
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:38.160]  look forward to speaking to you again soon.
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:39.160]  Thank you.
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:41.400]  All right, there goes Piers Corbin.
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:48.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna open the phones up in the next hour on any of the issues we've
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:54.840]  covered, from the NSA to the other harassment governments been engaged in against Tea Party
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:56:00.400]  with the IRS and the rest of it, to funding Al-Qaeda in Syria, all of it.
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:05.240]  Then I've got a bunch of other news I'm gonna cover as well, like app pays you to spot illegally
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:06.640]  parked cars.
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:12.600]  That's the future, everybody becomes a snitch in this niche society.
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:18.200]  Privacy experts use naked body scanner ruling in effort to stop NSA spying.
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:23.260]  That's a news, Steve Watson article up on infowars.com, we're gonna be getting to Tea
[01:56:23.260 --> 01:56:28.840]  Party Patriots, the largest Tea Party protest since 2010 is tomorrow, we're gonna be getting
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:31.640]  into that.
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:40.000]  We're also going to get into house to consider tax on new flu vaccines.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.440]  They're totally worthless, it's just all pointless.
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:53.120]  Pesticides slash water life by 42% show study of what it's doing to fish and aquatic life
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:54.920]  is just killing the water.
[01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:57.600]  But the pesticides they say now are safe, they said so.
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:01.600]  The Supreme Court decided your silence can be used against you, that totally violates
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:03.420]  the Constitution Fifth Amendment.
[01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:08.800]  That is all coming up and more straight ahead in the third hour.
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:15.080]  And I'll give you the latest on the stupid G8 Summit with all the globalist criminals
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:16.940]  meeting in Ireland.
[01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:19.720]  Third hour straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:32.080]  You are listening to GCN, visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:36.460]  I had tried everything, I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights
[01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:38.760]  and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:43.200]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:49.120]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and
[01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:50.120]  be satisfied.
[01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:54.460]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out
[01:57:54.460 --> 01:58:02.040]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:06.200]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound.
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:09.980]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:12.400]  than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:13.840]  Now that's results.
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:19.600]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarsteam.com and to order just three of
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:20.600]  their products.
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:26.680]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel and in your appetite almost immediately.

[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:46.480]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:51.320]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:52.320]  You want answers?
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:54.440]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:58.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:05.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:17.680]  All right, coming up, I'm going to be taking your phone calls, the toll-free number to
[01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:18.680]  join us.
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:24.760]  One of your first-time callers of chance again, 800-259-9231.
[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:29.800]  We will get you up and on the air, 800-259-9231.
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:30.800]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:34.400]  Look at this story from Breitbart.
[01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:42.000]  A OFA gun control rally in San Bernardino draws three protesters.
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:46.920]  Last week, Obama's political action arm, Organizing for Action, held rallies throughout the country
[01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:48.800]  advocating for stricter gun laws.
[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:50.600]  Not for government though, but for us.
[01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:54.280]  Their rallies drew smaller numbers as seen here and here.
[01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:59.760]  These small crowds, like when they had a pro-CNN rally, it had three people against me.
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:04.040]  We can thank the vigilant San Bernardino Sun for putting a spotlight on perhaps the smallest
[02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:05.740]  of the rallies.
[02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:12.720]  And it goes on to say three people were there.
[02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:18.020]  And by the way, these groups swiftly got their 501c4 status, which they won't give to libertarian
[02:00:18.020 --> 02:00:19.400]  or conservative groups.
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:22.760]  So that's the type of garbage we're dealing with.
[02:00:22.760 --> 02:00:27.720]  The truth is, they had a poll out a few months ago going, Americans don't want guns.
[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:34.960]  And it was put out by that public policy polling group, it's admittedly Democratic Party run.
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:39.440]  And they come up with polls going, Americans love to be spotted on, and they love Obama.
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:43.800]  But then all the other polls that are really independent show 10% approval ratings for
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:52.320]  Congress, 15, 20% approval ratings, depending on the poll, max 23% pro for the media.
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:58.880]  But they're sitting there targeting that tiny dumb audience that still believes them, that
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:03.160]  gets smaller and smaller and smaller.
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:06.000]  So the good news is people are waking up.
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:10.020]  By the way, I aired this earlier, but if you wanna see the trailer, it's even more powerful
[02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:11.120]  to see it.
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:16.680]  It's up on infoawars.com right now, a new film on mind control released.
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:18.580]  I'm in it, it's powerful.
[02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:22.520]  And I wanted to play one more time the trailer for everybody for state of mind that you can
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:33.200]  now order exclusively in DVD or Blu-ray at infoawars.com, here it is.
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:39.600]  Are we choosing our own paths, our own destiny, or has it been pre-selected for us?
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:48.520]  C.S. Lewis said, when training beats education, civilization dies.
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:53.000]  We need to always be cognizant of, as a free society, that information can be used as a
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  weapon.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:57.100]  Barrier to discovery is not ignorance, it's the illusion of knowledge.
[02:01:57.100 --> 02:02:00.520]  We are seen as nothing but biological androids.
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:07.960]  To gain control of education in America, not for a philanthropic purpose, but to change
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:10.840]  the thinking of the American people.
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:14.560]  From the time we're very young, we're taught to, you know, worship authority, basically,
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:16.920]  because that's our key to survival as young children.
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:21.240]  Discover the history, the present, and the future of mind control.
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:27.560]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:31.200]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:37.200]  And the CIA scientists could actually film people who had been surreptitiously dosed
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:38.400]  with LSD.
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:42.440]  There's a brain entrainment process that takes place.
[02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:48.080]  That gives the government free reign to create whatever story or narrative it wants to create.
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:51.800]  Whatever the public face of something is, whatever they're talking about publicly, there's
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:53.920]  something else over here they're probably not looking at.
[02:02:53.920 --> 02:03:00.560]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would fully endorse, not
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:03.120]  only endorse, but demand a war.
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:10.360]  When you watch mainline establishment television, you are putting yourself in front of the barrel
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:12.520]  of a gun.
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:19.240]  Discover the history, the present, and the future of mind control, psychological warfare,
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:20.600]  brainwashing.
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:22.800]  Are we controlled and manipulated?
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:24.000]  You bet.
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.280]  That's mind control par excellence.
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:32.920]  Find out how deep the rabbit hole really goes with this new groundbreaking documentary film,
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:37.760]  State of Mind, available exclusively at infowars.com.
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:42.760]  We'll be back on the other side.
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:47.000]  There is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.600]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:54.000]  silver-based products.

[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:10.200]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:14.880]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.560]  leave the silver at the surface.
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:22.040]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin-nourishing chemistry
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:27.720]  of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:29.280]  effectively.

[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:45.960]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:51.160]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops
[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:52.160]  alone.
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:55.680]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:59.540]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:04:59.540 --> 02:05:00.960]  The fact is you are.
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:02.120]  We all are.
[02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:04.600]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:09.360]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:13.080]  the cost and availability of your food supply with e Foods Direct.

[02:06:49.880 --> 02:07:07.600]  That's Alex Jones.
[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:08.600]  Welcome back, my friends.
[02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:17.280]  We are now into hour number three, and we are here live Monday through Friday from 11
[02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:21.320]  a.m. until 2 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:26.360]  We come back weeknights, 7 o'clock Central, with Infowars Nightly News with myself and
[02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:33.200]  my great crew of reporters and anchors and our great crew of researchers and writers
[02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:39.060]  and contributors and all of you out there as well, spreading the word about the broadcast,
[02:07:39.060 --> 02:07:45.040]  giving us intel, helping us be our eyes and ears out there and be aware of what's happening.
[02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:48.560]  And so I want to thank you all for joining us.
[02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:57.320]  The toll-free number to get involved on air is 800-259-9231, and we're gonna go to empty
[02:07:57.320 --> 02:08:01.360]  White House, Evan, William, Matt, Lee, and others.
[02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:05.760]  I kind of like it when people use their first name as a statement.
[02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:08.120]  Maybe we should encourage that.
[02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:12.800]  And maybe we shouldn't call in as Alex or David or John or Carol anymore.
[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:18.560]  We should call in with the NSA works for foreign banks from California.
[02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:23.680]  Or the Federal Reserve is a private crime syndicate calling from Texas.
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:27.760]  Or Barack Obama is a congenital liar from DC.
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:32.000]  Or there's cancer viruses in the vaccines from Kansas.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:36.720]  Or the New World Order wants you and your family dead from Minnesota.
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:43.920]  Or our government that runs Al-Qaeda and only to be arrested from New Mexico.
[02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:47.120]  I think that's a really great idea.
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:52.480]  So we'll go to empty White House here after I get into my review of the Man of Steel.
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:57.880]  Now, I like to hijack corporate globalist media.
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:03.160]  And if I would have thought about it, I would have been able as a media person to go see
[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:04.680]  a sneak peek they had a few weeks ago.
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:07.520]  In fact, I even got the offer and just didn't have time to go do it.
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:10.680]  And that could have done a review of the film.
[02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:15.280]  Or I could even wait till it came out last week, go see it, do a review on the radio.
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:16.280]  It's very popular.
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:17.740]  It'll get picked up all over the news.
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:21.600]  But I just got busy following other news.
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:26.280]  So I'm kind of doing training here on air right now as well for my crew, because I don't
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:28.480]  even do what I know works.
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:36.080]  You go cover their Super Bowl, or their Superman movie, or their big media event, and you hijack
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:37.080]  it.
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:43.240]  And then you cover it, but then put what you think the public isn't aware of into that
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:44.240]  report.
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:47.360]  I should have told all my reporters, you can do whatever you want this week, cuz they have
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:52.140]  so much freedom, but do something on Superman, whatever angle you want.
[02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:57.520]  And then they were, I'm just giving you total transparency, the thought process here.
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:01.800]  And then I was telling them this yesterday, and they go, like what, well, will Superman
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:04.820]  join the NSA?
[02:10:04.820 --> 02:10:10.560]  Is it right that Superman turns bad and starts looking through walls at women in the shower?
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:13.640]  We got a graphics department, go put it together, do it.
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:15.320]  Somebody will do it now, I'm announcing it on air.
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:17.000]  I don't care if somebody else does it.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.040]  Boom, that's a viral story right there.
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:21.040]  Tie Superman to the NSA scandal.
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:28.720]  See, I don't even use 1 10th of what I know to dominate and take over media with the truth.
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:32.400]  But that's the number one rule for alternative media, not just our operation, cuz we're all
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:33.400]  in this together.
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:36.560]  I'm not in competition with people.
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:42.520]  Hijack globalist media, hijack it, because they don't have any power in news anymore.
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:45.600]  They're a shadow of themselves when it comes to what they report on.
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:48.320]  Almost no one believes them, and those polls are out.
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:56.800]  Their share is shrinking, but they still have massive, massive, massive attention when it
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:04.960]  comes to entertainment programs, TV shows, dramas, sitcoms, Hollywood movies and things,
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:06.300]  video games.
[02:11:06.300 --> 02:11:13.040]  And when you go see a major action adventure movie or you go turn on a cop show or a drama
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:18.760]  show or a hospital show, or you go, I mean, I've seen, I don't know, 8, 9, 10, I forget.
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:21.840]  Just the last few months, new video games come out.
[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:26.440]  Every shoot-em-up military game I've seen from Rainbow Six to you name it, you're fighting
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:27.440]  malicious.
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:29.820]  It's our listeners that point us out and send us screenshots.
[02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:32.480]  We go watch the trailer, do a report on it.
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:37.000]  I've even told the crew, buy some of these video game consoles so we can monitor this
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:41.280]  and show how the Kinect spies on us and uses wireless to scan through the walls.
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:43.760]  And we can see you.
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:48.380]  Here's the Washington Times, by the way, Big Brother alert, cameras and cable boxes to
[02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:56.800]  monitor TV viewers, 17 years after I told you.
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:11:58.880]  And they knew this, now it's safe though.
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:02.620]  It's like in the past, I'd talk to reporters and they'd go, it doesn't matter if it's true.
[02:12:02.620 --> 02:12:04.720]  People just, they're not gonna believe it.
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:05.720]  It sounds crazy.
[02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:10.400]  Well, I mean, if it's real, it's real.
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:12.360]  But I mean, good job, Washington Times.
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:18.640]  The point is that there is a war in media and they are hitting you.
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:24.200]  I mean, my wife likes to watch TV more than I do when she exercises and things and I don't
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:25.200]  blame her.
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:28.780]  On the treadmill or whatever, watch a show and she goes, I can't watch anything.
[02:12:28.780 --> 02:12:32.680]  She likes hospital shows and cop shows and she stops him and goes, look at this.
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:35.840]  The mother that won't vaccinate is a murderer.
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:40.000]  Or look at this, the guy that's exposing chemtrails is gonna nerve gas New York.
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:45.680]  Or look at this show, the militia that works for the serial killer is gonna blow everybody
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:46.680]  up.
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:51.560]  Or this show about fixing up houses that's not even fiction, they went and found right
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:53.560]  wing gun owners to demonize in it.
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:56.800]  I mean, that's the message.
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:00.680]  And I know a lot of people in Hollywood, quite frankly, I don't have time to run after them
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:05.280]  and jump through hoops to sit there and go hang out with them and stuff to get them on
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:06.280]  the show.
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:10.560]  It's a big of a deal to have you even get a big Hollywood person on the show.
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:12.320]  People wanna hear about news and info.
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:14.480]  They're not really care about Hollywood stars.
[02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:16.820]  And Hollywood stars get that too.
[02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:20.160]  Those of them are sick of the narcissism and sick of the whole culture.
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:23.880]  But I'm here to tell you, here's the good news before I get into the Man of Steel review
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:26.920]  and then your calls.
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:34.280]  We were gonna go interview Ed Asner and a couple other Hollywood people out in LA for
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:36.360]  the upcoming Obama Deception 2.
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:41.040]  That's gonna blow away the last Obama Deception with everything in documents, which is hard
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:42.040]  to do.
[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:44.120]  That film's been seen over 40 million times free online.
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:45.160]  That's a big deal.
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:47.400]  That's what I'm into is hearts and minds, not the money.
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:50.120]  The money is just energy.
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:51.980]  And it's energy to wake people up.
[02:13:51.980 --> 02:13:54.780]  That's the energy I'm looking for, not energy that comes back to me.
[02:13:54.780 --> 02:14:02.820]  What I want coming back to me is a free planet, is a future for our world.
[02:14:02.820 --> 02:14:05.800]  To build a better world instead of a worse world.
[02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:07.520]  Jacobson has all the footage of this.
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:17.040]  He went to a movie conference and then he went to a TV conference and was mobbed wearing
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:23.120]  Infowars.com shirt by TV host and TV and movie stars and everything else.
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:28.640]  I mean, it's all on video, just mobbed like Elvis was there or something.
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:30.000]  That's how hot Infowars is.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.920]  And by the way, I'm not bragging about this.
[02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:35.200]  It's just a radar ping.
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:40.120]  But in the sum aggregate of what we've done, the hottest we are is in Hollywood because
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:44.480]  they all know they're paid to put propaganda in TV shows and movies.
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:47.300]  They all know the CIA and FBI are involved.
[02:14:47.300 --> 02:14:53.080]  They all know that the big lawyers and less than 15 big media bosses are total new world
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:59.600]  order and threaten them if they try to put pro-liberty messages in movies or TV shows.
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:04.760]  And they sit there hating putting subliminals saying that Ron Paul is a methamphetamine
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:09.560]  head and a criminal in Breaking Bad and things like that.
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:10.560]  They're aware of it.
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:14.120]  They're told, they're paid to do this, okay?
[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:16.600]  And that's come out in the news as well, but they're there.
[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:17.680]  They're hating it.
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:19.040]  They don't wanna be fake liberals.
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:21.760]  They don't wanna be fake conservatives.
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:25.460]  They wanna be good people.
[02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:28.760]  And they don't like the fact they have to run their scripts by the Pentagon, the communist
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:34.040]  Chinese, and multiple mafias now.
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:37.480]  And I mean, it's Jewish mafia and Italian mafia in Hollywood.
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:39.840]  And believe me, I've been out there, folks, in the meetings.
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:44.280]  I mean, it is Goodfellow level stuff with guys with cigars going, I'll tell you, you're
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:46.880]  not gonna get that done like that, okay?
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:52.400]  I mean, literally out of a Godfather movie, okay?
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:54.320]  And people are sick of it.
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:59.720]  And now these mobs have sold out, so you've gotta go get the Chicoms to agree.
[02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:02.600]  I was watching CNBC yesterday, as I told you.
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:05.560]  And they were complaining, I watched it for like an hour and a half while I was writing
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:09.400]  some notes and making phone calls, and rarely watch TV that much.
[02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:12.440]  And the whole time they were complaining going, yeah, it's great to have the folks that run
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:14.280]  Tiananmen Square buying up all the companies.
[02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:18.960]  They were watching pork companies, the biggest ones bought up and everything, and being sold
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:19.960]  off for nothing.
[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:25.040]  And there was not much of America left and they were all, cuz they like the ego of America's
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:30.040]  big and bad, and they all get that they're schmucks.
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:37.200]  And as I said years ago, the Saudi Arabians, the communist Chinese, they now own News Corp,
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:38.200]  they control it.
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:41.440]  It's not Rupert Murdoch anymore, they own it all.
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:43.760]  We're sold out, folks.
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:48.520]  And the old mafias that ran Hollywood, I mean, they're like 80 something years old now, these
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:50.700]  guys.
[02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:57.040]  And they're just fading off, and then you've got all the new writers, all the new people.
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:58.640]  What you're hearing here, by the way, is a big story.
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:03.600]  Somebody ought to codify this into an article.
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:06.720]  I mean, every party I've been to at Hollywood, I don't even go there anymore, cuz I don't
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:09.280]  have time to do it.
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:15.400]  Every A-lister event, everything I've been invited to that I've seen, everyone hates
[02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:17.280]  the New World Order.
[02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:20.300]  Everyone is against it, and these people really know what's going on.
[02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:26.160]  So I go see the new Tron movie a few years ago, total anti-eugenic film.
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:30.300]  And about the elite was wrong, we wanted to take over and kill everybody, it's wrong,
[02:17:30.300 --> 02:17:33.500]  we need to come together as humanity.
[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:35.400]  Just total anti-New World Order.
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:41.080]  I go see Oblivion, total anti-New World Order.
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:47.520]  I go see Man of Steel, total anti-New World Order.
[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:51.560]  And I know some of the people out there, not all of them, are listeners.
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:56.800]  And I've also consulted for some big movie makers, I had to sign non-disclosure forms
[02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:57.800]  over the last decade.
[02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:00.520]  I don't even really return the calls, now's not the time to mess with it.
[02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:04.000]  I probably should, cuz this is where the power is really at.
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:10.440]  But Infowars is on fire in Hollywood, only because it's only one of the few things coming
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:13.320]  up out of the media sea, it's one of the higher mountains.
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:17.920]  But there's all these other things below the surface that you can't see, and it just shows
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:19.280]  how big the awakening is.
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:24.800]  So when we come back, I'll give you my review of the Man of Steel, another anti-eugenics,
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:30.240]  anti-New World Order, anti-police state tour de force.
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:36.440]  If I could talk to the directors and writers, I'll guarantee you their anti-New World Order,
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:37.440]  and got this through.
[02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:39.560]  And the question is, how are they getting it through?
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:42.160]  I'll tell you.
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:46.440]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water

[02:20:40.440 --> 02:20:45.120]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:46.120]  Box.
[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:49.080]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:20:49.080 --> 02:20:53.880]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[02:20:53.880 --> 02:20:58.200]  House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:03.760]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:21:03.760 --> 02:21:08.820]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[02:21:08.820 --> 02:21:13.960]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:15.120]  normal cell.
[02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:18.780]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[02:21:18.780 --> 02:21:22.840]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:39.160]  Protect your immune system.
[02:21:39.160 --> 02:21:40.840]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:43.360]  What's safer and cheaper than prescription drugs?
[02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:44.660]  Glad you asked.
[02:21:44.660 --> 02:21:46.960]  The answer is renovation teas.
[02:21:46.960 --> 02:21:52.120]  Herbal remedies are much safer and much cheaper than prescription drugs, taste great, and
[02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:55.880]  most importantly, herbal teas are effective and non-addictive.
[02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:58.700]  Renovation tea is especially unique, and here's why.
[02:21:58.700 --> 02:22:02.920]  We spent years researching herbs and their beneficial properties.
[02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:07.080]  Renovation teas uses only 100% organic, fair trade herbs.
[02:22:07.080 --> 02:22:11.960]  Our teas are blended towards specific ailments and health conditions, such as diabetes, blood
[02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:16.160]  pressure, anxiety, libido, detox, and much more.
[02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:20.120]  All renovation teas are formulated and hand-filled in Arkansas.
[02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:23.680]  Take care of yourself naturally, the way Mother Nature intended.
[02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:31.520]  Order renovation teas at renovationtea.com or call 870-784-3121.
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:35.840]  That's 870-784-3121.
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:37.080]  Renovation teas.
[02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:42.160]  Renovate your health one bag at a time.
[02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:50.320]  Okay, so let me tell you what's happening in Hollywood.
[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:55.840]  All the young writers, all the new directors are tuned in, they're awake, and they see
[02:22:55.840 --> 02:23:00.480]  the whole corrupt system, the Pentagon spending billions for product placement to demonize
[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:01.480]  veterans and gun owners.
[02:23:01.480 --> 02:23:05.800]  I mean, they go to parties, the CIA's there telling them what to put in their reports.
[02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:12.120]  I mean, I've had Doug Hagman on the show to talk about this or Dean Hagman from the X-Files.
[02:23:12.120 --> 02:23:16.720]  This is all happening, and so they hear my show and they know it's accurate.
[02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:22.800]  And so what happens is also kind of the old mafia guard knows that it's popular to have
[02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:28.200]  pro-family messages, it's popular to have pro-liberty messages, and all of this anti-human
[02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:30.380]  stuff is getting less and less popular.
[02:23:30.380 --> 02:23:36.600]  So when things like the Bible get 12, 15 million viewers on a cable channel that usually has
[02:23:36.600 --> 02:23:40.480]  a million viewers if they're lucky, everybody is getting it.
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:47.360]  So their greed is also fighting with the fact that they wanna dominate the culture and politically
[02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:54.520]  dumb America down by giving us cultural bilge, but that isn't what sells.
[02:23:54.520 --> 02:23:57.360]  So there's been a revolution of other media platforms.
[02:23:57.360 --> 02:24:02.640]  And I don't know Christopher Nolan or David S. Goyer that wrote The New Man of Steel,
[02:24:02.640 --> 02:24:08.120]  but I've not been a Superman fan, not a big fan of comics regardless.
[02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:10.760]  All they are is Greek gods repackaged.
[02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:16.640]  Humans have this archetype of supermen and superwomen that then you model after and try
[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:19.440]  to build towards, they're archetypes.
[02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:20.480]  It's absolutely there.
[02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:25.920]  And they program these archetypes in, and they admit it's a Christ archetype, 33 years
[02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:30.400]  old, father's name, Joseph, Mother Mary, they changed it for this one.
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:36.320]  They keep explaining for 33 years the wise men of the military have been seeking after
[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:37.920]  him.
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:41.840]  But everything in the film was positive except for the police state element, just getting
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:46.560]  you acclimated to troops on the streets, pointing guns at reporters and things, and people being
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:50.200]  disappeared, men in black uniforms marching around.
[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:54.120]  That just becomes ubiquitous, and then we start expecting it, and then it's used as
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:25:02.040]  a simulation as well of things to come so that we start to accept it.
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:08.520]  But undoubtedly, this is an anti-eugenics film.
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:14.620]  And it gets into ancestral memories, instincts, a lot of other things, it's very, very heavy.
[02:25:14.620 --> 02:25:20.560]  But they know that's what sells, see, they have to give you that for it to be successful.
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:30.640]  But if you look at Superman developed back in 1933, and then you compare it to this film,
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:36.920]  it's basically the same story of Earth was seated in an early colonization program.
[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:42.280]  They don't come right out and say it, but that's what it is, by people from Krypton.
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:46.240]  But in wars and things, there are other settlements that broken down and died out.
[02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:52.660]  And that's the whole kind of secret issue at the end of the movie is that Zod wants
[02:25:52.660 --> 02:25:57.440]  to terraform and do a genetic re-overwrite, which is what the globalists are actually
[02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:03.240]  doing currently, to the atmosphere, but also to the genetic makeup of the planet.
[02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:07.440]  And as a eugenicist who believes that all the breeding must be planned in these Brave
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:13.040]  New World state run laboratories, and of course, Superman came out a year after Brave New World
[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:14.040]  came out.
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:21.840]  So it's also heavily, heavily influenced, Cicero, 1930, 1933.
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:33.040]  So it's a very sophisticated film, and overall is extremely positive because you can argue
[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:35.840]  with revelation of the method.
[02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:43.920]  You can argue to everybody that it's externalization of the hierarchy to condition us and prepare
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:46.000]  us.
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:51.120]  But that's not the effect it would have in my general analysis, and that's not the general
[02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:52.880]  message that I get out of it.
[02:26:52.880 --> 02:26:59.600]  So I see it again as an overall rebellion within the media mind control structure to
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:03.120]  put something out like this.
[02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:09.080]  And it's also the great quandary of people that are intelligent and people that are psychologically
[02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:16.880]  more advanced, people that can have a better sixth sense or look into people.
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:21.320]  There's a metaphor or an allegory of that where he has x-ray vision and it's freaking
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:25.040]  him out to be able to look into people's bodies when he's a kid.
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:30.480]  Just like it is oppressive for people in a way that are more enlightened and more intelligent
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:35.480]  and more sensitive because you then pick up on what people are doing and you see them
[02:27:35.480 --> 02:27:38.520]  and trying to manipulate you at a lesser level.
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:42.480]  And you're so much stronger and better than them at so many levels that you refuse to
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:43.580]  crush them.
[02:27:43.580 --> 02:27:48.640]  But then other people who are more advanced than the general slaves, the slave class,
[02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:53.040]  they're willing to use it all to dominate and control because they believe in social
[02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:57.920]  Darwinism, which General Zod's girlfriend actually talks about, that it's good to crush
[02:27:57.920 --> 02:28:03.280]  and destroy because you overall strengthen things in that process.
[02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:04.280]  And see, that's the issue.
[02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:10.580]  There are great truths in the whole social Darwinistic worldview, but then it's twisted
[02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:15.240]  because they're actually trying to dumb down the strongest because they get in the way
[02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:18.280]  of their larger master plan that's centralized.
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:22.560]  And even though Superman is better than the genetically engineered soldier Zod and his
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:28.480]  minions, they want to kill him because he's standing in the way of their hegemonic domination
[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:31.320]  and total control.
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:41.960]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:56.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order, it's Alex Jones on the
[02:31:56.280 --> 02:31:58.600]  GCN radio network.
[02:31:58.600 --> 02:32:06.960]  I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are accelerating their takeover
[02:32:06.960 --> 02:32:10.720]  plan because the world is waking up.
[02:32:10.720 --> 02:32:15.320]  And I repeat this every show now, just so you understand that you're not alone, I'm
[02:32:15.320 --> 02:32:20.640]  going to your phone calls and a bunch of news.
[02:32:20.640 --> 02:32:26.920]  I go out on the street in Austin, Texas, and I've got to wear a hat and sunglasses now
[02:32:26.920 --> 02:32:33.400]  if I want to go hiking or every other person, sometimes every person I walk by comes over
[02:32:33.400 --> 02:32:34.400]  to shake my hand.
[02:32:34.400 --> 02:32:38.640]  And that's humbling when some guy and his wife and kids are, oh, we heard this on the
[02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:39.640]  show.
[02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:40.640]  We appreciate you.
[02:32:40.640 --> 02:32:45.780]  And then, you know, a young woman, an old man, it's incredible.
[02:32:45.780 --> 02:32:48.200]  And then I go to other parts of the country, other parts of the world.
[02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:52.320]  I mean, you saw it on video where I'm just walking down the street in London, Alex Jones,
[02:32:52.320 --> 02:32:57.200]  Alex Jones, Alex Jones, something like 15 people are around me.
[02:32:57.200 --> 02:33:03.840]  And again, you aren't a well-known public figure, most of you, so you don't know how
[02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:06.720]  awake people are.
[02:33:06.720 --> 02:33:07.720]  You don't know.
[02:33:07.720 --> 02:33:08.720]  And it's in pockets, though.
[02:33:08.720 --> 02:33:12.840]  Sometimes I can go into some, especially small towns where people aren't kind of, I might
[02:33:12.840 --> 02:33:16.400]  go in a small town and everybody's awake, or I go in a small town, nobody's awake.
[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:20.840]  So there's also kind of pockets of it.
[02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:27.680]  But the police, genuinely, the last day of the Bilderberg event, well, that Saturday,
[02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:33.160]  there was another day after that, wanted to shake my hand, were giving me hugs, had tears
[02:33:33.160 --> 02:33:35.880]  in their eyes, the head police.
[02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:38.320]  And they would look when there's no camera around and grab me by the arm and go, we know
[02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:39.320]  what's going on.
[02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:40.320]  We don't like what's happening.
[02:33:40.320 --> 02:33:43.240]  You're like some big guy grabbing your arm.
[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:45.320]  People fundamentally understand they're being screwed.
[02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:47.560]  I mean, it's real simple.
[02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:50.960]  Nobody likes being a slave.
[02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:52.980]  Nobody likes being spied on.
[02:33:52.980 --> 02:33:56.100]  People know bad people are in control.
[02:33:56.100 --> 02:34:00.320]  And that's why the system is persecuting whistleblowers, because they're scared to death of that.
[02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:03.320]  Because the people that work for the government don't like where this is going on average.
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:08.260]  It's why government's trying to hire criminals, 2,000 this year hired at the State Department.
[02:34:08.260 --> 02:34:18.840]  Some of them aggravated felons, computer crimes, theft, grand theft, sexual assaults.
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:28.080]  Every couple days, there's people being indicted at the BBC and then pleading guilty to sexual
[02:34:28.080 --> 02:34:29.760]  crimes against children.
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:36.720]  It's just like those of us that aren't like that, it's like what, it isn't real to us.
[02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:40.320]  I get up here and tell you they're spying on you without warrants and it's like, that
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:44.720]  can't be true or your cable box has a microphone and a camera in it watching you.
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:45.720]  Here's the specs.
[02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:50.120]  Well, there's no way that's true and now it's mainstream news.
[02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:51.240]  They've got the jump on us.
[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:56.660]  They are light years ahead of us, but they're slowing down and we're speeding up.
[02:34:56.660 --> 02:34:58.300]  And it doesn't have to happen.
[02:34:58.300 --> 02:35:03.720]  They've tried to hardwire globalism into the world economy with too big to fail where if
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:07.440]  you remove that cancer, you'll die.
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:10.880]  But it doesn't matter, the cancer is going to eat us anyways.
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:17.280]  So we've got a chance if we really wake up and the last shoe to drop, the last balloon
[02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:20.960]  to go up is that you feel like you're alone.
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:23.120]  And they have these engines online.
[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:28.440]  They admittedly have it that just bad mouth liberty movement and bad mouth the real Tea
[02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:33.500]  Party and libertarians and bad mouth yours truly.
[02:35:33.500 --> 02:35:37.360]  And most of it we've proven it's come out are just engines that they call them sock
[02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:42.800]  puppets or megaphones, just attacking, attacking and ridiculing people so they feel like they're
[02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:43.800]  alone.
[02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:48.720]  The truth is the system is in headlong over the edge of the cliff panic.
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:51.920]  All right, I'm gonna go to your phone calls now.
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:55.800]  It's just that you've got a dichotomy.
[02:35:55.800 --> 02:35:56.800]  You've got paid for media.
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:01.200]  It's like the Washington Post came out last week and said, we're gonna have sponsored
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:02.200]  content.
[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:06.200]  You can pay us and we'll write an article about you or publish your article.
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:09.080]  Well, that's already going on for years.
[02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:13.320]  In fact, if you go to the London Guardian, which I think does some good work overall,
[02:36:13.320 --> 02:36:19.200]  that's why the Bill and Melinda Gates wanna buy them off, ABC News, all those major Sunday
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:25.640]  shows, at the end will say underwritten like it's PBS by Bill and Melinda Gates or Berkshire
[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:26.640]  Hathaway.
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:31.560]  And I can be watching some show on CNN and it'll be like, the family's bad, take all
[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:33.720]  your vaccines, guns should be turned in.
[02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:40.320]  Alex Jones is a filthy criminal, hates women, blah, blah, and at the end of the show, it'll
[02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:45.820]  say underwritten Bill and Melinda Gates.
[02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:50.900]  So MSNBC doesn't have a choice when they get up there and lie and say, Alex says Obama
[02:36:50.900 --> 02:36:54.400]  sent a tornado to Oklahoma, caller said, could this be weather weapons?
[02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:58.920]  And I said, well, they do have weather weapons, but not generally with tornadoes, it's hurricanes
[02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:00.060]  they can manipulate.
[02:37:00.060 --> 02:37:04.160]  Here's the Stanford Research Institute finding and here's the news articles and here's all
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:05.600]  these mainstream news.
[02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:11.120]  And then they take it out of context and say, and again, they know I didn't say that.
[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:14.860]  They're lying to their audience because that's all they've got.
[02:37:14.860 --> 02:37:18.980]  That's all they know how to do.
[02:37:18.980 --> 02:37:25.840]  They are not even obsolete, they destroyed themselves.
[02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:28.540]  And we don't have to go down with them.
[02:37:28.540 --> 02:37:33.480]  And so yes, I never did this on purpose, but the fact that I'm bold, I'm obnoxious, I'm
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:38.120]  angry, I'm real, that got through people's trance.
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:44.640]  At an instinctive animal level, I'm also intellectual, but an instinctive animal level, my body language
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:48.100]  everything, people know this is the real deal.
[02:37:48.100 --> 02:37:50.380]  And then they also have seen the stuff I've talked about.
[02:37:50.380 --> 02:37:55.240]  So because I'm interesting, and you're interesting too, you can be leaders.
[02:37:55.240 --> 02:37:59.000]  People stopped and listened and then didn't believe me, but years later it came out that
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:00.000]  I was right.
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.520]  So now they listen more.
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:04.620]  And folks, I don't even promote our main YouTube channel.
[02:38:04.620 --> 02:38:08.800]  It's getting like 20,000 subscribers a day right now.
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:14.960]  I mean, what do you think that is?
[02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:18.680]  It's because people are going like, that's the guy that said that, I wanna go see what
[02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:19.680]  he has to say.
[02:38:19.680 --> 02:38:22.280]  And I'm here to tell you, they're coming after us right now.
[02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:28.120]  Let me tell you, that didn't hype folks that I can pick up the phone and basically go have
[02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:32.240]  a meeting with anybody I want in Hollywood right now, but don't even do it because they're
[02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:33.320]  not allowed to go public.
[02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:35.840]  What's the point?
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:39.440]  The system does not like this, ladies and gentlemen, but they don't know what to do.
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:43.480]  But let me tell you, they got the eyes sore on looking right at me, folks, as I creep
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:45.540]  into Mordor.
[02:38:45.540 --> 02:38:49.440]  And I need all of you to help me and I'm helping you, we're helping each other carry the heavy
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:54.660]  burden to the crack of doom to drop it in to the fires from which it was forged.
[02:38:54.660 --> 02:38:58.500]  We have to admit the truth, the whole truth, and nothing about the truth, we have any chance
[02:38:58.500 --> 02:38:59.500]  of beating this.
[02:38:59.500 --> 02:39:05.440]  And we have a big chance of beating it, if people will just realize that it's scary what
[02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:09.520]  I'm saying, but it's already going on.
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:16.640]  So let's just admit it to ourselves and do something about it instead of thinking you're
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:17.640]  powerless.
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:20.240]  No wonder people say some of them, this is a depressing show.
[02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:23.040]  Because if you believe you don't have any power, what is the point?
[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:30.960]  If I believe we couldn't stop this, I would haul butt immediately to an island in the
[02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:34.480]  South Pacific, I've done research.
[02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:42.360]  I would leave immediately, okay?
[02:39:42.360 --> 02:39:46.800]  So people ever wanna ask, and it doesn't mean I'm right if I ever made that decision, I've
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:49.760]  committed to go down with the ship.
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:54.540]  I have committed, because you have to have that attitude to win, folks, I'm going 110%
[02:39:54.540 --> 02:39:56.080]  and I'm going down with the ship.
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:39:59.320]  Because as my ship's going down, the New World Order may blow up.
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:03.880]  That's how battles in history tend to work politically and in the info war.
[02:40:03.880 --> 02:40:06.720]  Who said maybe I won't go down with them?
[02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:08.760]  Who said you might go down with them?
[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:11.200]  But it doesn't matter, it's for future generations.
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:17.060]  Everything good we've got is because people were willing to die than be a slave, okay?
[02:40:17.060 --> 02:40:18.760]  You lay down, you will be a slave.
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:21.440]  You comply, you will get a government that enslaves you.
[02:40:21.440 --> 02:40:24.080]  You act like a slave, you will be a slave.
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:25.120]  You got that?
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:26.400]  And it's that simple.
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:29.840]  Stop acting like a slave if you don't wanna be a slave.
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:32.000]  Let's go to your phone calls, I apologize for ranting.
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.600]  MD White House, that's a great name.
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:35.600]  You're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:36.600]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:37.600]  Pretty good.
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:41.760]  Been trying to get all of you for about three years, I forgot all those questions, but I
[02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:46.160]  got a couple of things I'd like to ask you.
[02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:52.640]  With Adam Kokesh doing the march on Washington and that kind of thing, I remember when Farrakhan
[02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:57.000]  did his Million Man March, I was thinking back then, what would happen if all those
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:01.040]  million men were packing, you know?
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:07.160]  And so my question really is, what do you think of the scenario where a millionaire
[02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:11.800]  or so of us go to Washington and exercise our citizen arrest powers on these criminal
[02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:12.800]  politicians?
[02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:15.240]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:18.800]  We need to just keep calling them criminals, showing where they're criminals, and try to
[02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:23.680]  take over juries and grand juries and start prosecuting them and give police and people
[02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:27.900]  support if they try to, I mean, they tell cops what they're allowed to investigate.
[02:41:27.900 --> 02:41:32.000]  You can say to the cops, hey, the Federal Reserve's on record laundering $3 billion
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:33.800]  out of the San Antonio Federal Reserve.
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:37.920]  I can go with the AP and show cops there when we're in a protest, and the cops go, yeah,
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:40.800]  I know, I'm not allowed to investigate them.
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:46.800]  They'll do drug investigations on somebody selling a kilo a year, but they won't do an
[02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:48.920]  investigation on the bank that launders the money.
[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:55.200]  So so much of it is just the perception, but yeah, they do not like the citizen arrest
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:41:56.200]  power.
[02:41:56.200 --> 02:42:03.000]  I mean, if you caught a politician, let's say, beating a child with a baseball bat in
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:08.680]  an alleyway, citizen's arrest says you could punch them in the nose till they stopped and
[02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:10.860]  hold them down till the police got there.
[02:42:10.860 --> 02:42:15.720]  But the cops would probably arrest you because they've been told, don't let the slaves ever
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:20.800]  know, our power is a citizen's arrest power as well, and that we just swear an oath and
[02:42:20.800 --> 02:42:26.880]  then get special training to be able to be bonded an officer of the court.
[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:29.080]  So there's your answer on that.
[02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:34.380]  I mean, they would call it patriots trying to kidnap politicians, but you can do like
[02:42:34.380 --> 02:42:41.160]  the left has done, where you go with the handcuffs at a press conference and go, I have the handcuffs
[02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:48.040]  citizen's arrest for Obama, for drone strikes killing children, and then the message is
[02:42:48.040 --> 02:42:50.360]  they should be arrested.
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:53.800]  And then the cops come over and go, so you're really trying to kidnap the president?
[02:42:53.800 --> 02:42:55.640]  You go, no, obviously it's a protest.
[02:42:55.640 --> 02:42:58.680]  If they try to get you to opt in to say you were really trying to kidnap the president,
[02:42:58.680 --> 02:43:00.700]  it's 20 years in prison.
[02:43:00.700 --> 02:43:06.400]  So they play these games is why the cops will come and say, so when you said money bomb,
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:07.880]  you were planning to blow something up.
[02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:13.540]  They had Fox News say that about a Ron Paul money bomb, and that I was promoting it to
[02:43:13.540 --> 02:43:14.840]  bomb buildings.
[02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:22.840]  Now, that was six years ago when the campaign started for 2008 and 2007, when the public
[02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:24.320]  didn't know what money bombs were.
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:26.320]  Again, they knew what a money bomb was.
[02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:30.360]  They were cold bloodedly on Fox News going, these money bomb, was Glenn Beck actually,
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:33.160]  he was on CNN at the time, they did it later on Fox.
[02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:37.200]  We need to use the army on these Ron Paul people and these money bomb libertarians.
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:40.560]  They want to blow up the Capitol with a bomb.
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:43.760]  And of course, he knew full well what he was doing.
[02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:45.200]  I don't want to bash Glenn Beck.
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:50.200]  That's how dangerous he is though, saying we need to use the army on these Ron Paul
[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:51.200]  people.
[02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:57.440]  Now that we won politically, now that Ron Paul and Rand Paul are the hottest thing since
[02:43:57.440 --> 02:44:00.280]  the NFL draft or whatever.
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:04.480]  Now it's like, I love them.
[02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:09.800]  But when people didn't know what a money bomb was, yeah, Alex Jones with Ron Paul's Planet,
[02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:14.960]  a Guy Fawkes bomb, and they need to have the army used on them right now.
[02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:17.240]  And now the new thing is, yeah, I'm getting death threats from Alex Jones.
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:19.240]  I mean, he's totally made up.
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:20.640]  I'm in danger.
[02:44:20.640 --> 02:44:21.640]  He wants to get me.
[02:44:21.640 --> 02:44:22.640]  Help me, I'm weak.
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:24.640]  I told you the Jedi are taking over.
[02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:27.080]  I appreciate your call, empty White House.
[02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:28.840]  Matt, you're on the air.
[02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:29.840]  Welcome.
[02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:30.840]  Good to have you on here with us.
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:31.840]  How you doing, sir?
[02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:32.840]  Good, sir.
[02:44:32.840 --> 02:44:33.840]  Go ahead.
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:34.840]  Can I introduce myself?
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:37.840]  I'm not afraid to allow them to know my identity.
[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:39.240]  My name is Matthew Johnson.
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:46.640]  I served you, the people, starting in 1997 as a United States soldier.
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:51.000]  And then I transferred and lost all my rank to the United States Marine Corps.
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.140]  I've had two basic trainings.
[02:44:53.140 --> 02:44:58.480]  And I actually started looking into these things because I wanted them not to be true.
[02:44:58.480 --> 02:45:03.720]  And one of the piece of information I have here for you is, it's about Snowden, who they
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:05.280]  claim to be a traitor.
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:07.360]  It's about the NSA.
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:09.400]  I got on their website, and it's real simple.
[02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:10.400]  Anyone can do it.
[02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:13.440]  You get on their website at NSA.gov, and you look at careers.
[02:45:13.440 --> 02:45:18.320]  And they have legitimate careers, entry-level careers.
[02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:25.680]  And the description title of these careers is Network Exploitation Analysis.
[02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:32.160]  The second one is Global Network Exploitation Analysis.
[02:45:32.160 --> 02:45:38.440]  So that directly says in the title that that's what we're going to do is hack people's accounts,
[02:45:38.440 --> 02:45:43.240]  view what they're viewing, see what they're doing, who they're talking to.
[02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:46.960]  And that's a major problem, especially when you're talking about the Constitution of the
[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:47.960]  United States.
[02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:53.360]  My other issue is that I know here in our state, Texas, right up the road in Dickinson,
[02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:57.720]  Texas, they are teaching our kids the New World Order for two chapters of their government
[02:45:57.720 --> 02:45:58.720]  class.
[02:45:58.720 --> 02:45:59.720]  It's a 12th grade class.
[02:45:59.720 --> 02:46:01.800]  It's a book called American History.
[02:46:01.800 --> 02:46:02.800]  You can look it up.
[02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:05.880]  You can buy it for $212 on eBay.
[02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:11.240]  And that book, Chapter 33, it will tell you about the New World Order.
[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:12.240]  But the situation is-
[02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:14.680]  No, no, no, no, no, listen.
[02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:20.840]  Starting about eight years ago, they show the patents, they show the program, and they
[02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:25.860]  say, we're adding to jet fuel, barium salts, aluminum dioxide, and other things to save
[02:46:25.860 --> 02:46:28.960]  the Earth from sun radiation.
[02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:32.800]  We're geoengineering, and there's the whole program starting with eight graders.
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:37.560]  In fact, I've got a copy of the textbook somewhere around here.
[02:46:37.560 --> 02:46:42.280]  But then they go on the news and say it doesn't exist, and I say Obama runs the tornadoes
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:43.360]  as a way to discredit it.
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:47.920]  So yes, they say, we've got the kids, and they teach them, men are bad, families are
[02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:51.000]  bad, we're gonna take your guns, world government's coming.
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:52.960]  I've actually seen that textbook before.
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:54.280]  Somebody scanned it and sent it to me.
[02:46:54.280 --> 02:46:59.600]  But will you scan it and email it to showtipsatinfoawars.com again?
[02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:01.520]  What is that, like a 2008 edition?
[02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:04.560]  Actually, you wanna know the truth?
[02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:06.560]  The book was published in 1991.
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:11.040]  But it must be a new edition, cuz I've seen that before.
[02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:12.040]  What's it called?
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:13.040]  The American History Reader.
[02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:14.040]  What's it called?
[02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:19.960]  The American History, 1970 to the present, to the present, to today.
[02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:23.360]  And in the 33rd chapter, I can get you the nomenclature and everything, I actually did
[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:24.360]  that already.
[02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:29.760]  I talked to both our Congressmen and contacted every, I talked to both our Senators and contacted
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:30.760]  different Congressmen.
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:37.120]  Listen, Time Magazine for Kids, about 11 years ago, as I showed it on air a bunch, said your
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:40.160]  parents belong to the old past and they're foolish.
[02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:42.840]  It actually said that, I'm paraphrasing.
[02:47:42.840 --> 02:47:47.480]  And they don't understand, and they don't want you to have really cool stuff.
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:50.340]  That's why they're against putting chips in you.
[02:47:50.340 --> 02:47:52.120]  This was Time Magazine for Kids, folks.
[02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:54.440]  I showed it probably 15 times on air more.
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:58.320]  For weeks, I held it up and talked about it on my TV show and radio show.
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:03.540]  And it said, if they belong to the old age and don't want you to have fun, you know better
[02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:04.540]  than them.
[02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:08.560]  I mean, it was like if I was writing a dystopic novel, how Big Brother would talk to the kids.
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:09.720]  You're gonna get a chip.
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:12.840]  I mean, they've got your kids, is what I'm saying.
[02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:17.480]  And now with centralized curriculum, the teachers aren't even allowed to teach what they want,
[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:19.320]  cuz they know teachers are sneaking stuff in.
[02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:21.380]  They've got cameras watching the teachers.
[02:48:21.380 --> 02:48:25.840]  They're now fired if they don't walk in and just be jail guards, basically.
[02:48:25.840 --> 02:48:26.840]  Go ahead.
[02:48:26.840 --> 02:48:27.840]  And I'll tell you what.
[02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:32.280]  I mean, if it doesn't exist, like mainstream media says, then why are they teaching it
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:33.280]  to them?
[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:34.280]  Well, sir.
[02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:38.680]  The next thing is they can keep their fancy schmancy cool stuff, their Xbox One, their
[02:48:38.680 --> 02:48:39.680]  nonsense.
[02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:45.120]  In 1997, I rose my hand and I took that oath to defend the Constitution of the United States
[02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:48.400]  against all enemies, both foreign and domestic.
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:49.400]  I didn't wanna get involved.
[02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:53.280]  But I took that oath, and I have to keep my word before God.
[02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:57.000]  So the situation is, is people do need to wake up.
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.040]  They do need to do their own research.
[02:48:59.040 --> 02:49:02.400]  They can keep their fancy schmancy crap, but we need to keep that Constitution.
[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:03.400]  No, I hear you.
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:04.400]  Listen, God bless you.
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:07.440]  I gotta jump to break, come up with more calls, but you're absolutely right, sir, and God
[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:08.440]  bless you for waking up.
[02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:12.160]  And I'm glad you tried to prove me wrong and found out that I was telling the truth.
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:16.800]  This is a technocratic re-engineering of the whole world, a takeover towards authoritarianism.
[02:49:16.800 --> 02:49:22.520]  And it's all hidden in plain view, yeah, your TV's watching you, yeah, the Xbox connect,
[02:49:22.520 --> 02:49:27.000]  you know, looks through your walls and reports back to the Pentagon, big deal, Pentagon cares
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:28.000]  about you.
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.880]  Did you take your shots today?
[02:49:30.880 --> 02:49:37.040]  I mean, again, they knew when they blew up the chemical weapons dumps in Gulf War One,
[02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:39.880]  it was gonna hurt our troops, and then they covered it up, okay?
[02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:42.260]  These are evil people.
[02:49:42.260 --> 02:49:46.840]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:51.560]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us 20 billion in lost crops
[02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:52.560]  alone.
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:56.080]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:49:56.080 --> 02:49:59.920]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:02.480]  The fact is you are, we all are.
[02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:04.680]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:09.740]  You might not be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[02:50:09.740 --> 02:50:13.440]  the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:18.320]  Be prepared before you need it with nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:20.680]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:24.280]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best, durable foods out there from
[02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:25.280]  eFoods Direct.
[02:50:25.280 --> 02:50:31.340]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex and
[02:50:31.340 --> 02:50:32.840]  check out their spring specials.
[02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:39.440]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:50:39.440 --> 02:50:41.860]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[02:50:41.860 --> 02:50:45.520]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:49.880]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:50:49.880 --> 02:50:51.880]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:50:51.880 --> 02:50:57.480]  Infidel body armor can stop every round, including hollow points and.308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[02:50:57.480 --> 02:50:59.480]  priced and fully legal.
[02:50:59.480 --> 02:51:00.480]  But for how long?
[02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:07.560]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L, BodyArmor.com.
[02:51:07.560 --> 02:51:11.280]  Infidel body armor just won't quit.
[02:51:11.280 --> 02:51:15.480]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:19.720]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[02:51:19.720 --> 02:51:20.720]  to service debt.
[02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:24.240]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[02:51:24.240 --> 02:51:27.560]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:51:27.560 --> 02:51:28.560]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:31.800]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:35.040]  Call for your copy, 800-686-2237.
[02:51:35.040 --> 02:51:36.440]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:51:36.440 --> 02:51:38.840]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:38.840 --> 02:51:41.440]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:51:41.440 --> 02:51:43.480]  Have you ever consumed protein powder supplements?
[02:51:43.480 --> 02:51:44.480]  I have.
[02:51:44.480 --> 02:51:48.560]  And all of them don't taste that good, have artificial flavors, sweeteners or unhealthy
[02:51:48.560 --> 02:51:49.560]  sugars.
[02:51:49.560 --> 02:51:53.320]  About a year ago, I was introduced to a new protein powder that changed my experience.
[02:51:53.320 --> 02:51:57.360]  This protein powder made me feel noticeably better and it tasted more delicious than any
[02:51:57.360 --> 02:51:59.120]  drink I've ever had.
[02:51:59.120 --> 02:52:02.200]  Here's the experience of one satisfied user named Rich.
[02:52:02.200 --> 02:52:06.860]  The term best of all worlds has been belabored to death and yet I've just discovered a whey
[02:52:06.860 --> 02:52:10.960]  protein powder that truly deserves to be called best of all worlds.
[02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:12.840]  Best taste, by far.
[02:52:12.840 --> 02:52:14.840]  Best results, by far.
[02:52:14.840 --> 02:52:18.560]  You almost feel like you're cheating that something that tastes that good could be so
[02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:19.960]  good for you.
[02:52:19.960 --> 02:52:22.400]  Thank you, Steven and Cocoon Nutrition.
[02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:27.160]  One world whey truly is the best of all worlds, the only way for me.
[02:52:27.160 --> 02:52:29.440]  Yours truly, Rich from Georgia.
[02:52:29.440 --> 02:52:32.120]  Real user, real happy.
[02:52:32.120 --> 02:52:37.800]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit one world whey dot com.
[02:52:37.800 --> 02:52:45.360]  That's one world, w-h-e-y dot com.
[02:52:45.360 --> 02:53:07.880]  By the way, that last caller pointed out the NSA has network exploitation people on it
[02:53:07.880 --> 02:53:10.600]  and that is folks to break in and take over domestic computers.
[02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:14.400]  You go to the Cyber Command the last four or five years, they've been advertising that,
[02:53:14.400 --> 02:53:16.200]  admitting they're doing it.
[02:53:16.200 --> 02:53:22.280]  Of course, and it's all domestically aimed, which they've denied, which is just ridiculous.
[02:53:22.280 --> 02:53:26.000]  So right there is something important that was brought up by a caller.
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:27.440]  Lee in Ontario, Canada.
[02:53:27.440 --> 02:53:28.920]  Thanks for calling in, Lee.
[02:53:28.920 --> 02:53:31.120]  Can you hear me?
[02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:32.880]  Yes, sir, I can.
[02:53:32.880 --> 02:53:33.880]  Oh, okay.
[02:53:33.880 --> 02:53:34.880]  Okay.
[02:53:34.880 --> 02:53:37.480]  Here's one of the things I wanted to say.
[02:53:37.480 --> 02:53:46.080]  About a year ago, I sent you an article about American police being able to, they have jurisdiction
[02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:47.080]  in Canadian waters.
[02:53:47.080 --> 02:53:48.880]  I don't know if you ever got it.
[02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:49.880]  I did.
[02:53:49.880 --> 02:53:54.480]  And our military now patrols your streets in areas of Canada.
[02:53:54.480 --> 02:53:56.760]  It's absolute new world order garbage.
[02:53:56.760 --> 02:53:57.760]  Yes.
[02:53:57.760 --> 02:54:01.800]  And actually up here, I'm actually in Kapuskasing, Ontario.
[02:54:01.800 --> 02:54:08.440]  And up here in World War II, we had a POW camp, and lately, in the last two years, we've
[02:54:08.440 --> 02:54:12.520]  been seeing an influx of armored personnel.
[02:54:12.520 --> 02:54:15.920]  The army has been setting up natural disaster drills here.
[02:54:15.920 --> 02:54:21.000]  Yeah, yeah, they use natural disaster, but in tanks, it's really civil unrest.
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:25.900]  You should go as a citizen journalist, give yourself a name, the name of your organization.
[02:54:25.900 --> 02:54:28.120]  Go shoot video, put it on YouTube.
[02:54:28.120 --> 02:54:29.120]  Go up and ask the military.
[02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:30.120]  You have nothing wrong.
[02:54:30.120 --> 02:54:32.080]  But what are the armored vehicles for?
[02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:33.080]  Exactly.
[02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:34.080]  Exactly.
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:37.720]  And the other thing is, I'm actually from Vancouver Island, British Columbia.
[02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:42.340]  And there was this, you know, I heard about you maybe, oh gosh, eight years ago.
[02:54:42.340 --> 02:54:49.000]  And there's this guy who actually, he used to be heavily involved into the Satanic cult,
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.540]  and a witch turned Christian, born again.
[02:54:51.540 --> 02:54:56.500]  And he showed me, he took me to all the parks in town, and they all had the Nazi symbols
[02:54:56.500 --> 02:54:57.500]  on the gates.
[02:54:57.500 --> 02:55:00.640]  And nobody actually noticed this.
[02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:05.000]  So it's just a little fact I wanted to tell you.
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:06.560]  No, no, it's gang sign.
[02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:12.240]  Just like when you see gang stuff, graffiti, you don't know what it means.
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:14.560]  They all know what it means.
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:18.440]  And it is just overrun with gangs and cults.
[02:55:18.440 --> 02:55:22.880]  And these are all just people looking for power who then use it to get more people into
[02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:25.300]  their group to abuse them and suck off of them.
[02:55:25.300 --> 02:55:29.040]  It's absolutely pathetic and disgusting.
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:31.320]  I appreciate your call, Lee.
[02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:36.760]  Well, that's another show.
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:38.840]  Evan in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:39.840]  Go ahead.
[02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:40.840]  Yes.
[02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:41.840]  Clived and beyond.
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:43.600]  How are you doing today?
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:45.760]  You're listening on XM 244, sir.
[02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:46.760]  Welcome.
[02:55:46.760 --> 02:55:49.520]  Well, thank you very much for waking me up, Alex.
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:53.320]  Say, I've got a really important message tomorrow in Washington.
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:56.800]  It's going to be a press conference over this immigration bill.
[02:55:56.800 --> 02:56:02.320]  And throughout the day, I like how Wendy Williams pointed out several times that they have buzzwords,
[02:56:02.320 --> 02:56:05.560]  and you can hear it on the news, okay?
[02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:08.840]  And I'm going through the XM channels this afternoon.
[02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:14.760]  Some right-to-work advocates have sat there and said that they're trying to slam RFID
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:21.080]  chips, not just for the immigrants, but for anybody and everybody in the United States
[02:56:21.080 --> 02:56:26.720]  would have to receive an RFID chip in it in themselves to be able to work.
[02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:32.000]  And they're saying, well, better if there would be a violation of being able to have
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:33.560]  the right to work.
[02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:40.280]  So they're pushing implantable microchips on the news, you're saying?
[02:56:40.280 --> 02:56:46.040]  Better if there's some right-to-work advocates got into that bill, and it's very important
[02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:52.080]  that we have to get behind, these Congressmen will be coming out in Washington, it's a pretty
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:53.080]  big deal.
[02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:55.280]  Did I misunderstand you?
[02:56:55.280 --> 02:56:58.320]  You said they're promoting implantable chips to work?
[02:56:58.320 --> 02:57:04.240]  No, that's what's in that bill, this immigration bill.
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:06.760]  Some right-to-work advocates have gotten in there.
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:08.000]  No, no, I've been in the bill.
[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:12.600]  No, I know it's got a national ID in it with a microchip in it, but then the illegals will
[02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:13.600]  all be exempt.
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:14.600]  Very, very interesting.
[02:57:14.600 --> 02:57:15.600]  I'm going to do some overdrive.
[02:57:15.600 --> 02:57:24.000]  Thank you, Evan, to talk to Alicia, Lisa, and Eric straight ahead, back in 60 seconds.
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:25.000]  Thank you.

[02:58:33.200 --> 02:58:36.680]  Mystic Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:58:36.680 --> 02:58:46.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:58:46.760 --> 02:58:51.560]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:58:51.560 --> 02:58:52.560]  You want answers?
[02:58:52.560 --> 02:58:54.680]  Well, so does he.
[02:58:54.680 --> 02:58:58.880]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:58.880 --> 02:59:05.360]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:59:05.360 --> 02:59:10.200]  Bill Ayers came out and defended Obama saying he said he'd be middle of the road, but he
[02:59:10.200 --> 02:59:15.880]  went on to say, I think he should be put on trial for war crimes with every other president.
[02:59:15.880 --> 02:59:17.120]  That's giving him left cover.
[02:59:17.120 --> 02:59:20.520]  Bill Ayers literally, Obama grew up with him.
[02:59:20.520 --> 02:59:26.600]  That is meant to give left cover to Obama and to have the fake right wing defending.
[02:59:26.600 --> 02:59:30.440]  But then Ayers goes on to say, but oh, he's still a good guy, basically.
[02:59:30.440 --> 02:59:35.460]  So it's a bunch of rhetoric, but that article's up on Infowars.com right now.
[02:59:35.460 --> 02:59:37.880]  Let's go to Alicia in Minnesota.
[02:59:37.880 --> 02:59:38.880]  You're on the air.
[02:59:38.880 --> 02:59:39.880]  Welcome.
[02:59:39.880 --> 02:59:40.880]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:59:40.880 --> 02:59:41.880]  Hey, there.
[02:59:41.880 --> 02:59:42.880]  How's it going?
[02:59:42.880 --> 02:59:43.880]  Good.
[02:59:43.880 --> 02:59:47.240]  Just a couple of things I wanted to talk about, especially about the TSA.
[02:59:47.240 --> 02:59:51.240]  You had a girl on there a couple of weeks ago talking about TSA searches.
[02:59:51.240 --> 02:59:56.440]  Probably about eight years ago, when I was about 17, I flew on a flight and they told
[02:59:56.440 --> 03:00:01.040]  me because I had put my flight on standby because I was sick, that I had to be put into
[03:00:01.040 --> 03:00:02.040]  a special search.
[03:00:02.040 --> 03:00:04.640]  And I thought that it was really weird at the time.
[03:00:04.640 --> 03:00:08.440]  My mom and I kind of thought it was strange, but we complied.
[03:00:08.440 --> 03:00:12.760]  And then they started to do the search and it was very intrusive, I mean, extremely intrusive.
[03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:15.920]  I mean, they touched everywhere and anything they could.
[03:00:15.920 --> 03:00:19.520]  I mean, they're looking in your undergarments, on the outside, on the inside.
[03:00:19.520 --> 03:00:21.040]  Let me be clear.
[03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:23.680]  Are you saying they said we think you might be sick?
[03:00:23.680 --> 03:00:28.720]  No, they were saying that because I was sick and put my flight on standby to get home sooner
[03:00:28.720 --> 03:00:30.960]  because I was in a wheelchair at the time, I was really sick.
[03:00:30.960 --> 03:00:32.560]  I had a lot of health problems.
[03:00:32.560 --> 03:00:35.640]  I've always had health problems my whole life.
[03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:39.440]  They were saying because I put my flight on standby that I had to be searched.
[03:00:39.440 --> 03:00:44.480]  Because at that time, standby was a flag for terrorists, that terrorists put their flights
[03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:45.480]  on standby.
[03:00:45.480 --> 03:00:46.480]  No, no, no.
[03:00:46.480 --> 03:00:49.960]  It's all part of they're looking for terrorists when the government, nine times out of 10,
[03:00:49.960 --> 03:00:50.960]  is running the terrorist.
[03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:55.040]  And when the TSA does that with me, I go, wait, you work for the government on record
[03:00:55.040 --> 03:00:56.560]  that runs Al-Qaeda.
[03:00:56.560 --> 03:00:59.400]  So stop acting like I'm a suspect and you're not.
[03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:05.160]  I mean, the TSA have been caught being, stealing people's stuff, being pedophiles at record
[03:01:05.160 --> 03:01:06.160]  numbers.
[03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:08.640]  They, they are the suspects, not me.
[03:01:08.640 --> 03:01:09.640]  Right.
[03:01:09.640 --> 03:01:10.640]  Go ahead.
[03:01:10.640 --> 03:01:15.760]  I mean, I've even received little notes in my bags before about, because I always roll
[03:01:15.760 --> 03:01:17.160]  up my stuff military style.
[03:01:17.160 --> 03:01:20.780]  They put notes in my bag when I've flown like, hey, you're packing your stuff too tight for
[03:01:20.780 --> 03:01:21.780]  us to search.
[03:01:21.780 --> 03:01:22.960]  We couldn't get in your bag.
[03:01:22.960 --> 03:01:27.760]  And I mean, it's every single time I've flown and people at first used to think I was a
[03:01:27.760 --> 03:01:31.560]  little bit nutty about it when I was telling them, you know, I think for some reason I'm
[03:01:31.560 --> 03:01:32.560]  being watched.
[03:01:32.560 --> 03:01:36.720]  I think for some reason they know something and they're, they're tracking me and sending
[03:01:36.720 --> 03:01:39.540]  little notes in my bags every time I fly.
[03:01:39.540 --> 03:01:44.520]  And so people just need to start waking people up slowly, start showing them the inconsistencies
[03:01:44.520 --> 03:01:49.000]  that you are showing them on a daily basis to the people that they love and know, and
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:53.560]  try to wake them up, how you know, you can get to people because you know, some things
[03:01:53.560 --> 03:01:58.020]  can seem out there for the, for the first time, people who are just waking up, really
[03:01:58.020 --> 03:02:02.420]  need to focus on how you can get it to each individual person, you know, because if you're
[03:02:02.420 --> 03:02:06.040]  a listener of Alex Jones, you already are awake.
[03:02:06.040 --> 03:02:07.360]  I hear you spread the word.
[03:02:07.360 --> 03:02:08.360]  Good to hear from you.
[03:02:08.360 --> 03:02:12.640]  I'm going to do some overdrive as I need to go back to four hours every day.
[03:02:12.640 --> 03:02:15.880]  I'm going to come back and go to Lisa, Lucy and Abraham, but that's going to be it for
[03:02:15.880 --> 03:02:23.040]  calls because I want to play this video NSA agent caught snooping on video.
[03:02:23.040 --> 03:02:29.160]  This is some of the funniest satire I've ever seen, but it's real.
[03:02:29.160 --> 03:02:31.800]  He's just not NSA.
[03:02:31.800 --> 03:02:39.320]  He goes out in this video on the street with a boom microphone, listening to people and
[03:02:39.320 --> 03:02:43.760]  saying, we've been spying on you, but now we're just going public.
[03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:47.180]  And you know, the people threatened to kick his butt and stuff, a dog attacks him.
[03:02:47.180 --> 03:02:48.840]  And this is a real video.
[03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:49.840]  These are real people.
[03:02:49.840 --> 03:02:54.760]  It's just that he's not really NSA and it just illustrates what they're really doing,
[03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:55.760]  but it's covert.
[03:02:55.760 --> 03:02:59.240]  I mean, if I went to my neighbor's house and said, hi, I want to come in and plant microphones
[03:02:59.240 --> 03:03:00.240]  in your house.
[03:03:00.240 --> 03:03:06.840]  They'd, they'd probably try to punch me in the nose, but as long as government does it,
[03:03:06.840 --> 03:03:08.120]  it's supposedly okay.
[03:03:08.120 --> 03:03:11.940]  So that's in the featured stories archive.
[03:03:11.940 --> 03:03:14.400]  It's already a scrolled off the page.
[03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:21.040]  That's why it's so important to click on the top stories link at the top of info wars.com
[03:03:21.040 --> 03:03:23.440]  because all the big stories that roll off will be there.
[03:03:23.440 --> 03:03:26.160]  But I want to take some of your calls, play that.
[03:03:26.160 --> 03:03:28.960]  And then also the Veritas project, they've got their new book out.
[03:03:28.960 --> 03:03:34.300]  We're going to put it in the shopping cart as soon as they sell some to us, really showing
[03:03:34.300 --> 03:03:35.480]  you how to be an activist.
[03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:36.600]  They've learned a lot of great lessons.
[03:03:36.600 --> 03:03:37.600]  We've learned a lot from them.
[03:03:37.600 --> 03:03:43.000]  They've learned a lot from us and they've caught some pretty powerful video introducing
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:47.860]  pro wine, all of your filtration in one system, portable on the go.
[03:03:47.860 --> 03:03:48.860]  No more.
[03:03:48.860 --> 03:03:52.440]  Do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride?
[03:03:52.440 --> 03:03:57.880]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosolic
[03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:03.520]  acid advanced manufacturing technology combined silver impregnated white ceramic with new
[03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:08.440]  aqua medics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one

[03:06:59.720 --> 03:07:00.960]  Mabe.
[03:07:00.960 --> 03:07:06.480]  It's up on Infowars.com, I also tweeted it out at RealAlexJones is a good place to find
[03:07:06.480 --> 03:07:07.480]  it.
[03:07:07.480 --> 03:07:14.360]  NSA agent caught snooping on video and again this is some of the best satire I have ever
[03:07:14.360 --> 03:07:15.400]  seen.
[03:07:15.400 --> 03:07:21.640]  He's not a real NSA agent but these are real people.
[03:07:21.640 --> 03:07:23.440]  These are real people.
[03:07:23.440 --> 03:07:27.160]  There's a little bit of racing language towards the end so I'm not gonna play the whole thing
[03:07:27.160 --> 03:07:32.080]  but it is up on my Twitter at RealAlexJones and up on Infowars.com.
[03:07:32.080 --> 03:07:36.000]  It's scrolled off the main page already in the featured news archive so just click on

[03:07:52.920 --> 03:07:58.800]  but let's go ahead and go to him walking around for radio listeners with a big boom mic coming
[03:07:58.800 --> 03:08:02.800]  up to people sitting around having lunch at a cafe outside, people sitting on a bench
[03:08:02.800 --> 03:08:06.800]  at a bus stop and some of them you know say I'm gonna get up and kick your butt and keep
[03:08:06.800 --> 03:08:07.800]  doing that.
[03:08:07.800 --> 03:08:09.920]  I mean this is real.
[03:08:09.920 --> 03:08:14.760]  These are real people but when the government does it and but he says it's the government
[03:08:14.760 --> 03:08:18.200]  so I'm going okay but others say yeah that degenerate government.
[03:08:18.200 --> 03:08:20.520]  So let's go ahead and a little dog attacks him.
[03:08:20.520 --> 03:08:21.520]  It's amazing.
[03:08:21.520 --> 03:08:22.520]  Here it is.
[03:08:22.520 --> 03:08:23.520]  The government, we just monitor people's phone calls.
[03:08:23.520 --> 03:08:24.520]  Can you get away from me?
[03:08:24.520 --> 03:08:33.920]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't run from the NSA.
[03:08:33.920 --> 03:08:39.680]  He's chasing them down the street and if you don't want to be listened to that's a sign
[03:08:39.680 --> 03:08:40.680]  of your criminality.
[03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:41.680]  They're on a park bench.
[03:08:41.680 --> 03:08:42.680]  We just monitor people's phone calls.
[03:08:42.680 --> 03:08:43.680]  Would you mind?
[03:08:43.680 --> 03:08:44.680]  Go ahead.
[03:08:44.680 --> 03:08:45.680]  I don't mind.
[03:08:45.680 --> 03:08:46.680]  Go ahead.
[03:08:46.680 --> 03:08:47.680]  I'm fine.
[03:08:47.680 --> 03:08:48.680]  Hold up.
[03:08:48.680 --> 03:08:55.160]  We got to monitor conversations, the government and now the secret's out we don't even bother
[03:08:55.160 --> 03:08:56.160]  hiding anymore.
[03:08:56.160 --> 03:08:59.160]  It's for your own safety.
[03:08:59.160 --> 03:09:03.200]  Yeah, we've been doing that for years, sir.
[03:09:03.200 --> 03:09:05.720]  He goes why are you putting the camera on me?
[03:09:05.720 --> 03:09:07.720]  For over 20 years we've been videotaping.
[03:09:07.720 --> 03:09:10.440]  No, no, no, you're fine.
[03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:11.440]  Now he's in the toilet.
[03:09:11.440 --> 03:09:15.800]  Going to find out Obama's not running the country.
[03:09:15.800 --> 03:09:26.480]  Chuck Norris, Chuck Norris, Kung Fu, the karate guy, Chuck Norris, Chuck Norris, can you hear
[03:09:26.480 --> 03:09:27.480]  that?
[03:09:27.480 --> 03:09:29.320]  The guy believed it because he's dressed in a suit.
[03:09:29.320 --> 03:09:30.720]  The Chuck Norris runs America.
[03:09:30.720 --> 03:09:33.880]  You know what Chuck Norris does pushups.
[03:09:33.880 --> 03:09:34.880]  We do this periodically.
[03:09:34.880 --> 03:09:35.880]  It's just random people.
[03:09:35.880 --> 03:09:45.320]  He doesn't move, the earth does.
[03:09:45.320 --> 03:09:46.320]  Again you've got to go to the video.
[03:09:46.320 --> 03:09:47.320]  Which way are you going?
[03:09:47.320 --> 03:09:48.320]  It's even more powerful.
[03:09:48.320 --> 03:10:04.620]  He says if you don't leave me alone right now I'm going to basically come after you.
[03:10:04.620 --> 03:10:06.440]  Now he's looking at what this lady's reading at a cafe.
[03:10:06.440 --> 03:10:08.440]  Just checking your email out with the government.
[03:10:08.440 --> 03:10:13.280]  We do this time and time.
[03:10:13.280 --> 03:10:15.280]  There's the Pomeranian attacking.
[03:10:15.280 --> 03:10:19.280]  I love it.
[03:10:19.280 --> 03:10:21.080]  We never got permission to look at anybody.
[03:10:21.080 --> 03:10:22.080]  We just did it.
[03:10:22.080 --> 03:10:23.080]  It's the government.
[03:10:23.080 --> 03:10:24.080]  It's the government.
[03:10:24.080 --> 03:10:29.600]  By the way, there are now Obama groups asking him to spy on Tea Party.
[03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:33.160]  I'll tell you what you need to do.
[03:10:33.160 --> 03:10:34.160]  What's that?
[03:10:34.160 --> 03:10:35.160]  What's that, sir?
[03:10:35.160 --> 03:10:36.160]  It's sticking up to you guys.
[03:10:36.160 --> 03:10:37.160]  Get the hell away from me.
[03:10:37.160 --> 03:10:40.420]  I'm a government official, sir.
[03:10:40.420 --> 03:10:41.880]  We do not stick microphones on our.
[03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:47.360]  You don't do that to me.
[03:10:47.360 --> 03:10:48.680]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:10:48.680 --> 03:10:51.480]  So that guy really knows what he's talking about there.
[03:10:51.480 --> 03:10:54.000]  Now going to another serious piece.
[03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:55.000]  This is exclusive.
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.320]  You know, the folks that brought down Acorn.
[03:10:57.320 --> 03:10:59.740]  You could have done this too, a citizen journalist.
[03:10:59.740 --> 03:11:02.120]  Going in with women, going, hi, this is an underage prostitute.
[03:11:02.120 --> 03:11:03.880]  We're going to run slaves.
[03:11:03.880 --> 03:11:08.360]  And they're like, let us help you run the slaves, and you go to another acre in office.
[03:11:08.360 --> 03:11:12.580]  As long as you're a Democrat, it's okay, I mean, the Democratic Party really is an organized
[03:11:12.580 --> 03:11:17.280]  crime organization with a bunch of useful idiots following it around.
[03:11:17.280 --> 03:11:21.560]  And the Republicans are a bunch of well-meaning fascist supporters on average.
[03:11:21.560 --> 03:11:24.740]  The average Republican really thinks that the Republican Party's good and has no idea
[03:11:24.740 --> 03:11:28.140]  it's an al-Qaeda running crime syndicate basically.
[03:11:28.140 --> 03:11:34.400]  The hidden camera catches wireless company employees passing out Obama phones to people
[03:11:34.400 --> 03:11:38.880]  who say they'll sell them for drugs, shoes, handbags, and spending cash.
[03:11:38.880 --> 03:11:42.920]  Yeah, we interviewed one lady, not the Obama phone lady, we interviewed her too, who'd
[03:11:42.920 --> 03:11:48.080]  gotten over 100 free phones in just the last few years.
[03:11:48.080 --> 03:11:52.060]  And again, it's just a giant boondoggle, and the telecommunications companies, they make
[03:11:52.060 --> 03:11:56.080]  the money off of it.
[03:11:56.080 --> 03:12:01.480]  So let's go ahead and go to this Project Veritas report, here it is.
[03:12:01.480 --> 03:12:08.720]  They're known as Obama phones, a $2.2 billion lifeline program that doles out free phones
[03:12:08.720 --> 03:12:14.280]  to anybody who qualifies, all funded by charges that appear on your phone bill.
[03:12:14.280 --> 03:12:18.560]  Although the program was started two decades ago, both the employees who give out the phones
[03:12:18.560 --> 03:12:26.560]  and the people who receive them credit President Obama.
[03:12:26.560 --> 03:12:34.000]  The Obama phones, are they like, are always giving them out?
[03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:38.360]  Congress is currently discussing the waste, fraud, and abuse rampant in the program, so
[03:12:38.360 --> 03:12:40.640]  we decided to investigate.
[03:12:40.640 --> 03:12:45.960]  Would these Obama phone workers tell us to take phones we don't actually need?
[03:12:45.960 --> 03:12:49.120]  Would they tell us these phones are sold to buy drugs?
[03:12:49.120 --> 03:13:03.720]  It's kind of a question that I do this here, and unfortunately, there are people on drugs.
[03:13:03.720 --> 03:13:04.720]  They get this phone, and they go get $40.
[03:13:04.720 --> 03:13:05.720]  Why don't you guys give me the phone?
[03:13:05.720 --> 03:13:06.720]  That's my phone?
[03:13:06.720 --> 03:13:07.720]  Yeah.
[03:13:07.720 --> 03:13:08.720]  Gosh, so I can, like, sell it.
[03:13:08.720 --> 03:13:09.720]  You want to do it?
[03:13:09.720 --> 03:13:10.720]  Get some money for heroin.
[03:13:10.720 --> 03:13:11.720]  Hey, I'm a judge.
[03:13:11.720 --> 03:13:12.720]  Okay, thank you.
[03:13:12.720 --> 03:13:13.720]  Yep.
[03:13:13.720 --> 03:13:19.240]  Would they tell us to sell the phones and break the law?
[03:13:19.240 --> 03:13:23.360]  And would they tell us, after breaking the law, to plead the fifth?
[03:13:23.360 --> 03:13:28.120]  On my application, one more question, when I come back on the application, should I put
[03:13:28.120 --> 03:13:32.640]  down the I intend to sell it, or don't, like, put that up?
[03:13:32.640 --> 03:13:36.080]  That's totally, like, in the fifth on it.
[03:13:36.080 --> 03:13:37.080]  Okay.
[03:13:37.080 --> 03:13:38.080]  You know that's illegal.
[03:13:38.080 --> 03:13:39.080]  It is?
[03:13:39.080 --> 03:13:40.080]  Uh, yeah.
[03:13:40.080 --> 03:13:41.080]  It's, it's, there's our guidelines.
[03:13:41.080 --> 03:13:43.800]  It, it's, it, it's against the law.
[03:13:43.800 --> 03:13:48.640]  If you're interested in working with me, can I make your phones work, I recommend you guys
[03:13:48.640 --> 03:13:49.640]  any phone show.
[03:13:49.640 --> 03:13:51.640]  I can get the phone and then sell it.
[03:13:51.640 --> 03:13:53.680]  Yeah, I don't care what they have here.
[03:13:53.680 --> 03:13:57.960]  And if we wanted to break the law and use the money from the free phones to buy a Louis
[03:13:57.960 --> 03:14:03.600]  Vuitton handbag, what would the worker in this program that you pay for advise us to
[03:14:03.600 --> 03:14:04.600]  do?
[03:14:04.600 --> 03:14:07.480]  I just need, you know how it is.
[03:14:07.480 --> 03:14:14.000]  I love bags and I have so many, I am in debt, so I need to sell as many of these phones
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:17.720]  as possible to pay off my bills and stuff.
[03:14:17.720 --> 03:14:20.600]  So I don't know what to do.
[03:14:20.600 --> 03:14:21.600]  Okay.
[03:14:21.600 --> 03:14:28.600]  I mean, all I'm saying is thank God for Obama because Obama is basically paying for my Louis
[03:14:28.600 --> 03:14:32.440]  Vuitton bag right now, if you know what I mean, so.
[03:14:32.440 --> 03:14:33.440]  To sell the phone?
[03:14:33.440 --> 03:14:34.440]  I thought I could do what I want.
[03:14:34.440 --> 03:14:40.400]  What I want is up to you and don't have nothing, just keep it to yourself, just keep it to
[03:14:40.400 --> 03:14:41.400]  yourself.
[03:14:41.400 --> 03:15:03.040]  Yeah, it feels good to be a gangster, baby.
[03:15:03.040 --> 03:15:05.120]  Thank you, Obama.
[03:15:05.120 --> 03:15:09.000]  We went to the stand-up wireless store in Philadelphia and confronted the store manager.
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:18.080]  I have James O'Keefe, he's a Project Veritas, and basically he's a journalist, he's a journalist,
[03:15:18.080 --> 03:15:24.600]  he's here, he wants to show me something saying that our employees was breaking the law so
[03:15:24.600 --> 03:15:25.760]  he has some footage.
[03:15:25.760 --> 03:15:30.000]  Who denied the worker giving out phones in the stand-up wireless tent was her employee.
[03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:34.040]  I'm not sure where this location was at, so I'm not.
[03:15:34.040 --> 03:15:36.040]  It was here in Philadelphia.
[03:15:36.040 --> 03:15:38.160]  Those employees don't even look familiar to me.
[03:15:38.160 --> 03:15:40.400]  They must have been trained by the IRS commissioner.
[03:15:40.400 --> 03:15:44.360]  We then asked the store manager about a worker who actually worked right next to the manager
[03:15:44.360 --> 03:15:45.360]  inside the store.
[03:15:45.360 --> 03:15:46.360]  I know nothing.
[03:15:46.360 --> 03:15:47.360]  Nothing.
[03:15:47.360 --> 03:15:49.200]  And she admitted it was her employee, but defended his actions.
[03:15:49.200 --> 03:15:52.040]  The manager then told us to contact the head of her company.
[03:15:52.040 --> 03:15:56.560]  This is, I wanted to show you, this is two, I forgot to show you, this is your employee,
[03:15:56.560 --> 03:15:57.560]  right?
[03:15:57.560 --> 03:15:58.560]  Yes.
[03:15:58.560 --> 03:16:02.520]  All right, that's good.
[03:16:02.520 --> 03:16:06.720]  The rest of it's up on infowars.com, it's on drudgerport.com, it's all over the place.
[03:16:06.720 --> 03:16:09.000]  And that's investigative journalism.
[03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:12.640]  In fact, we ought to send our crew out with a hidden camera and go to one of these Obama
[03:16:12.640 --> 03:16:16.840]  phone things and walk in and say, I'm gonna use it to buy a crack.
[03:16:16.840 --> 03:16:19.840]  And they'll sit there and give it to you, and then come back a day later and get another
[03:16:19.840 --> 03:16:20.840]  phone.
[03:16:20.840 --> 03:16:27.440]  You can just get the phone over and over and over again, taxpayer paid for.
[03:16:27.440 --> 03:16:33.080]  We did send undercover people into the Austin water facility on a tour, but we weren't supposed
[03:16:33.080 --> 03:16:37.360]  to have cameras to show where it said deadly poison, one drop and you're dead, skull and
[03:16:37.360 --> 03:16:38.360]  crossbones.
[03:16:38.360 --> 03:16:41.660]  It eats holes in the concrete and they're pumping it right into the water.
[03:16:41.660 --> 03:16:44.960]  But that's what you gotta do to illustrate this to people.
[03:16:44.960 --> 03:16:48.120]  Let's go ahead and go to Lisa in Arkansas and we'll come back and talk to everybody
[03:16:48.120 --> 03:16:49.120]  else.
[03:16:49.120 --> 03:16:50.120]  You wanna talk about agenda 21, go ahead.
[03:16:50.120 --> 03:16:51.120]  Hey, Alex.
[03:16:51.120 --> 03:16:52.120]  Hey.
[03:16:52.120 --> 03:17:00.640]  Hey, yes, there is a thing going on that they're trying to do here in Arkansas and Missouri.
[03:17:00.640 --> 03:17:03.320]  It's the White River Watershed Blueway.
[03:17:03.320 --> 03:17:08.240]  Yeah, and then they take property up to 10 to 50 miles on each side, don't let you build
[03:17:08.240 --> 03:17:09.240]  on it.
[03:17:09.240 --> 03:17:10.640]  And basically they're the mafia.
[03:17:10.640 --> 03:17:11.640]  What's wrong with that?
[03:17:11.640 --> 03:17:12.640]  It's very loving.
[03:17:12.640 --> 03:17:13.640]  This is covering 17.8 million acres.
[03:17:13.640 --> 03:17:14.640]  I know, it's massive.
[03:17:14.640 --> 03:17:21.480]  I know, it's insane and no one it seems like here has heard of it.
[03:17:21.480 --> 03:17:25.960]  Well see, when they shut down your land use, then all the insider mafia, they're gonna
[03:17:25.960 --> 03:17:28.840]  be allowed to build, so their property is gonna increase in value.
[03:17:28.840 --> 03:17:30.560]  I mean, what's wrong with that?
[03:17:30.560 --> 03:17:31.560]  It's loving.
[03:17:31.560 --> 03:17:32.560]  I know.
[03:17:32.560 --> 03:17:38.520]  Well, in Arkansas, we have to do resolutions in each county.
[03:17:38.520 --> 03:17:42.680]  And there's only been maybe nine that's done so far.
[03:17:42.680 --> 03:17:45.880]  And that's why I called you just to try to get the word out, because I know you have
[03:17:45.880 --> 03:17:48.440]  a lot of listeners here in Arkansas.
[03:17:48.440 --> 03:17:54.920]  Yes ma'am, every major river and even sidestreams, they're going 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 miles out
[03:17:54.920 --> 03:17:56.920]  in some cases.
[03:17:56.920 --> 03:18:01.360]  They sit there and gerrymander the maps where, cuz all these big boards meet, and all the
[03:18:01.360 --> 03:18:05.440]  insiders, their land is excluded, or they get a waiver later.
[03:18:05.440 --> 03:18:10.200]  And then they just say, it's for the earth, you can't build on your property now.
[03:18:10.200 --> 03:18:16.800]  We're liberal, with troops with black uniforms and machine guns behind them.
[03:18:16.800 --> 03:18:20.680]  I mean, it's just like, drink some more poison, lady.
[03:18:20.680 --> 03:18:23.080]  Take some more shots and roll over and die.
[03:18:23.080 --> 03:18:26.800]  I mean, it's just a military takeover.
[03:18:26.800 --> 03:18:29.360]  You go to these meetings and they're all just there.
[03:18:29.360 --> 03:18:32.000]  Not the public smart growth ones, but the ones that get announced, but they're not really
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:33.800]  promoted, where they actually meet beforehand.
[03:18:33.800 --> 03:18:38.080]  They're just like, and they're going, and my property will be off limits from the agreement
[03:18:38.080 --> 03:18:39.680]  so years, Bob.
[03:18:39.680 --> 03:18:43.040]  They just rub their hands together and just.
[03:18:43.040 --> 03:18:44.040]  Why not?
[03:18:44.040 --> 03:18:45.040]  I mean, they're hardcore criminals.
[03:18:45.040 --> 03:18:46.040]  What's wrong with that?
[03:18:46.040 --> 03:18:48.080]  We put up with it, so we deserve it, don't we?
[03:18:48.080 --> 03:18:49.640]  Yes, we really do.
[03:18:49.640 --> 03:18:52.120]  Our country is ours to lose.
[03:18:52.120 --> 03:18:57.920]  I mean, around here, they took hundreds of thousands acres the last 15 years for a watershed.
[03:18:57.920 --> 03:19:01.600]  And then they have the former mayors and people that did it, owning the banks that you have
[03:19:01.600 --> 03:19:04.800]  to go to, and then you get a waiver to build on your own property.
[03:19:04.800 --> 03:19:11.200]  I mean, but they don't have names like Gotti or Gambino.
[03:19:11.200 --> 03:19:14.360]  And people are like, only Italians can be criminals.
[03:19:14.360 --> 03:19:22.520]  There's no way people with names like Watson or Jones could be criminal, or if you're black,
[03:19:22.520 --> 03:19:23.520]  you can't be a criminal.
[03:19:23.520 --> 03:19:27.480]  Obama, a peace prize, or if you're, I mean, it just goes on and on.
[03:19:27.480 --> 03:19:29.760]  It's like if you're wearing a suit, it's okay.
[03:19:29.760 --> 03:19:34.280]  I'm serious, you could have guys in suits and ties if they were really fancy and Armani
[03:19:34.280 --> 03:19:39.400]  suits with meat cleavers, just chopping children up in like a watermelon stand.
[03:19:39.400 --> 03:19:43.080]  One a leg, one an arm, and as long as you're wearing a suit, the police would be there
[03:19:43.080 --> 03:19:46.760]  and help move the child in and bring a guillotine in to cut their heads off.
[03:19:46.760 --> 03:19:48.960]  How you doing today, ma'am?
[03:19:48.960 --> 03:19:50.520]  Crazy, but true.
[03:19:50.520 --> 03:19:57.000]  I'm being a little sarcastic, but you know why I quit doing a fourth hour.
[03:19:57.000 --> 03:19:59.580]  I tend to go wild in the fourth hour.
[03:19:59.580 --> 03:20:03.000]  That's what happens and it's wrong, and I appreciate your call, ma'am.
[03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:07.480]  I think a fourth hour, the reason I quit was, A, I get too exhausted afterwards and I can't
[03:20:07.480 --> 03:20:09.360]  get the rest of my work done for a while.
[03:20:09.360 --> 03:20:14.640]  But B, and more importantly, it gets to me all this news, so I start getting really satirical.
[03:20:14.640 --> 03:20:20.280]  In fact, look at my Twitter account, one of our Twitter accounts, real Alex Jones.
[03:20:20.280 --> 03:20:25.640]  And again, there's that video if you wanna see it down there from six hours ago.
[03:20:25.640 --> 03:20:29.440]  Video NSA caught taping people in public, best satire ever.
[03:20:29.440 --> 03:20:31.440]  Please retweet that out to everybody you know.
[03:20:31.440 --> 03:20:34.800]  Okay, let's go to another extremist, Lucy in Texas.
[03:20:34.800 --> 03:20:37.120]  Lucy, you're not dead.
[03:20:37.120 --> 03:20:40.680]  You haven't been drinking enough flour, I've taken enough shots, honey.
[03:20:40.680 --> 03:20:44.280]  Why are you hurting the earth, even being alive?
[03:20:44.280 --> 03:20:46.960]  I'm actually a newly awakened American.
[03:20:46.960 --> 03:20:48.800]  Whoa, that's extreme.
[03:20:48.800 --> 03:20:55.360]  It is, and over the past few months, I've really come across a lot of information.
[03:20:55.360 --> 03:21:01.000]  And talking about the weather today, I've noticed last week we had a little circulation
[03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:05.920]  of storms coming in and it was over the past, just like four days straight.
[03:21:05.920 --> 03:21:11.080]  And I kinda just noticed how the pattern came in, it came in from the south one day, then
[03:21:11.080 --> 03:21:14.760]  it came in from the east another day, and then from the north, and then it just kinda
[03:21:14.760 --> 03:21:16.760]  did a circular thing.
[03:21:16.760 --> 03:21:22.320]  With a lot of the things, we're going through a really dry season, I'm trying to do a lot
[03:21:22.320 --> 03:21:26.160]  of things here at my house and get things going, and with the chemtrails and all that,
[03:21:26.160 --> 03:21:28.240]  it really is a hindrance for a lot of us.
[03:21:28.240 --> 03:21:34.640]  And Texas agriculture's been struggling lately, so we're really trying to hang in there.
[03:21:34.640 --> 03:21:41.280]  And I just kind of thought, I read something about HAARP and how a lot of theories about
[03:21:41.280 --> 03:21:46.320]  how it influenced the earthquake in Japan and it influenced a lot of other natural disasters,
[03:21:46.320 --> 03:21:49.760]  maybe even Hurricane Sandy that went through New York.
[03:21:49.760 --> 03:21:50.760]  And-
[03:21:50.760 --> 03:21:58.200]  Well, ma'am, there are giant admitted weather modification programs going on for at least
[03:21:58.200 --> 03:22:03.280]  20 years, and they were doing a lot of tests for decades before that.
[03:22:03.280 --> 03:22:08.160]  But definitely the weather has been manipulated, and they're trying to get better and better
[03:22:08.160 --> 03:22:12.280]  at controlling it, while denying it exists to the general public, even though it's an
[03:22:12.280 --> 03:22:16.840]  official congressional boards and UN treaties.
[03:22:16.840 --> 03:22:23.760]  So absolutely, I mean, there's all sorts of weather modification going on, but the public's
[03:22:23.760 --> 03:22:29.280]  almost in like a Stone Age level technology compared to what the establishment's got.
[03:22:29.280 --> 03:22:32.800]  And so they like to just keep us totally in the dark, treat us like children and say,
[03:22:32.800 --> 03:22:33.800]  oh, there's no NSA.
[03:22:33.800 --> 03:22:39.320]  I mean, I'd get phone calls in like 1996 on radio saying there is no NSA.
[03:22:39.320 --> 03:22:43.200]  That was first when they were admitting it was going on, and Echelon was spying.
[03:22:43.200 --> 03:22:49.040]  People would say, not only are they not spying, cuz that's illegal, and we're not 1984, but
[03:22:49.040 --> 03:22:52.440]  it doesn't exist.
[03:22:52.440 --> 03:22:56.680]  But I mean, now the street lights have got microphones in them, the newer ones, I mean,
[03:22:56.680 --> 03:22:58.680]  it's just unbelievable.
[03:22:58.680 --> 03:23:06.160]  Taking a chance, calling in and getting to share information with you, but I think information
[03:23:06.160 --> 03:23:11.240]  is our virtue right now, and we need to communicate and share information.
[03:23:11.240 --> 03:23:16.080]  And that's what's gonna get us maybe to the answer of what is their agenda?
[03:23:16.080 --> 03:23:17.080]  And don't-
[03:23:17.080 --> 03:23:20.040]  Well, yeah, that's why they wanna keep their agenda secret so we can't have a debate about
[03:23:20.040 --> 03:23:21.040]  it.
[03:23:21.040 --> 03:23:25.600]  So they just go, it doesn't exist, doesn't exist, Brooklyn Bridge doesn't, it'd be like
[03:23:25.600 --> 03:23:32.560]  we said, scientists are saying, hypothetically, the Brooklyn Bridge may be in danger of collapsing.
[03:23:32.560 --> 03:23:34.480]  And their answer would be, there is no Brooklyn Bridge.
[03:23:34.480 --> 03:23:37.720]  And you could be there going, well, there's the Brooklyn Bridge right there, and you could
[03:23:37.720 --> 03:23:38.920]  be in Manhattan.
[03:23:38.920 --> 03:23:42.000]  And they'd say, no, no, it isn't.
[03:23:42.000 --> 03:23:46.000]  So they just play this mind game with us, sorry, go ahead.
[03:23:46.000 --> 03:23:50.800]  During your Bilderberg weekend, I was following that, and I actually came across some videos
[03:23:50.800 --> 03:23:51.800]  on YouTube.
[03:23:51.800 --> 03:23:58.280]  I think I tried sending them to Paul, and my email just kept giving me a Mailer, Damon,
[03:23:58.280 --> 03:23:59.280]  air thing.
[03:23:59.280 --> 03:24:04.320]  But I came across a video on YouTube where the Honorable Paul Hellyer, the Minister of
[03:24:04.320 --> 03:24:10.680]  National Defense, actually disclosed information about Bilderberg in relation to UFOs.
[03:24:10.680 --> 03:24:15.920]  And me coming from a Christian background, and I've never believed in things like that.
[03:24:15.920 --> 03:24:21.720]  And here lately, like I said, I'm newly awakened, and information has literally just been so
[03:24:21.720 --> 03:24:22.720]  soaking in.
[03:24:22.720 --> 03:24:23.720]  And-
[03:24:23.720 --> 03:24:24.720]  Well, here's my issue.
[03:24:24.720 --> 03:24:27.200]  I mean, there are obviously unidentified flying objects.
[03:24:27.200 --> 03:24:30.040]  That doesn't mean that there are aliens in there.
[03:24:30.040 --> 03:24:32.000]  I mean, you see stuff all the time.
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:36.040]  It's like they had NSA blimps over cities, and they would go, look, it's aliens.
[03:24:36.040 --> 03:24:44.080]  They had propellers on it, cuz you couldn't say it was an NSA blimp with the solar panels
[03:24:44.080 --> 03:24:45.360]  on top.
[03:24:45.360 --> 03:24:48.240]  So you had to say it was an alien.
[03:24:48.240 --> 03:24:52.280]  But I just don't know about that whole UFO crowd.
[03:24:52.280 --> 03:24:53.560]  There's just so much this info in it.
[03:24:53.560 --> 03:24:55.200]  But good to hear from you, Lucy.
[03:24:55.200 --> 03:24:56.200]  Glad you called in.
[03:24:56.200 --> 03:24:57.200]  Good to have you on board.
[03:24:57.200 --> 03:24:58.200]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[03:24:58.200 --> 03:24:59.520]  You're absolutely right.
[03:24:59.520 --> 03:25:06.200]  Spreading information is seminal, and it's key, and it's paramount.
[03:25:06.200 --> 03:25:11.200]  Let's go to Abraham in Ontario, Syria and NATO is what you'd like to talk about.
[03:25:11.200 --> 03:25:12.680]  Yeah, that's correct.
[03:25:12.680 --> 03:25:17.560]  First of all, Alex, my name is Abraham.
[03:25:17.560 --> 03:25:21.200]  I'm a Lebanese Muslim, and I really respect your work and your opinions.
[03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:25.520]  Now, just one more thing before getting to the subject.
[03:25:25.520 --> 03:25:31.200]  When looking at the whole political spectrum, there's a left, and the things that they talk
[03:25:31.200 --> 03:25:38.240]  about, and the fake right, as you say, they all come up to the same distortion on the
[03:25:38.240 --> 03:25:39.240]  Middle East, right?
[03:25:39.240 --> 03:25:43.600]  There's a very big distortion.
[03:25:43.600 --> 03:25:46.800]  First of all, I'm Muslim, I have Muslim friends.
[03:25:46.800 --> 03:25:50.280]  A lot of them respect you and really respect your opinions, for one.
[03:25:50.280 --> 03:25:52.120]  So I'm going to get into the subject.
[03:25:52.120 --> 03:25:56.560]  So I wanted to make a connection between Libya and Syria.
[03:25:56.560 --> 03:26:01.480]  They're very similar cases.
[03:26:01.480 --> 03:26:07.280]  What happened is very similar, but Libya, as you know, Gaddafi tried to establish a
[03:26:07.280 --> 03:26:10.320]  new currency, a new gold currency, and now, as you know, gold is-
[03:26:10.320 --> 03:26:14.720]  Yeah, no, it's part of the same war, same people, same everything, yeah.
[03:26:14.720 --> 03:26:16.960]  Yeah, but just one more thing I wanted to add.
[03:26:16.960 --> 03:26:24.480]  I know, as I'm Muslim, Al-Qaeda is a satanic, crazy group, I know, funded, brainwashed.
[03:26:24.480 --> 03:26:26.760]  They're a bunch of drugheads, if you'd like.
[03:26:26.760 --> 03:26:33.080]  But what I wanted to get to is, even though the rebels in Syria are the ones in the wrong,
[03:26:33.080 --> 03:26:37.400]  you got to understand that the Assad government, they want to keep the sovereignty, but they
[03:26:37.400 --> 03:26:40.000]  do have secret arrests and secret torture behind the scenes.
[03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:46.640]  And if you go on YouTube, there are loads of videos from both sides, and before this
[03:26:46.640 --> 03:26:52.280]  whole revolt was going on, for example, I have an uncle, I'm Lebanese in Lebanon, he
[03:26:52.280 --> 03:26:56.680]  used to see all sorts of bad things about the Assad government, and he got secretly
[03:26:56.680 --> 03:26:57.680]  arrested by that government.
[03:26:57.680 --> 03:27:03.240]  There is no doubt that the Assad regime is a dictatorship, and I don't support them,
[03:27:03.240 --> 03:27:12.000]  but I do not support an offensive attack on Syria giving Al-Qaeda weapons while they take
[03:27:12.000 --> 03:27:17.240]  my rights away because of a manufactured Al-Qaeda threat, and they want a clash of civilizations.
[03:27:17.240 --> 03:27:24.480]  So I understand that, sir, I mean, my issue was the CIA isn't overthrowing the country
[03:27:24.480 --> 03:27:28.880]  to put a good government in, they're doing it to destabilize the whole region.
[03:27:28.880 --> 03:27:33.480]  That's on record, and God bless you, got 20 seconds for closing comment.
[03:27:33.480 --> 03:27:37.040]  Yeah, that's correct, and that's a really good point, which is one more thing I wanted
[03:27:37.040 --> 03:27:43.000]  to say is, a lot of people, like I love the views of Libytranism, you said you're a constitution
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:48.160]  populist, I really like respect that, but one thing is, I've seen a lot of the extreme
[03:27:48.160 --> 03:27:52.080]  right, I really like the freedom values that you guys have, and I really, I share them
[03:27:52.080 --> 03:27:56.920]  as a Canadian living near Niagara, and something really fast is, you guys have got to open
[03:27:56.920 --> 03:27:59.760]  your mind, as David Icke says, on the views of Islam.
[03:27:59.760 --> 03:28:02.560]  I don't want you guys to convert, but let's just have peace, and let's live together,
[03:28:02.560 --> 03:28:05.400]  let's, the Palestinians, the Israelis, let's live together, you know?
[03:28:05.400 --> 03:28:09.200]  All right, we're out of time, I hear you, my friend, I appreciate your call, look, let's
[03:28:09.200 --> 03:28:12.600]  get the cancer viruses out of the vaccines, I mean, I'm trying to deal with those issues.
