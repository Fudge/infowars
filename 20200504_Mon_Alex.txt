[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Reuters is reporting that the Chinese military is preparing for
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.400]  war with the United States.
[00:14.400 --> 00:21.000]  High-level government officials are openly calling for the arrest of James Comey, and
[00:21.000 --> 00:25.200]  for him to be charged with treason and given the death penalty.
[00:25.200 --> 00:26.400]  All hell is breaking loose.
[00:26.400 --> 00:31.000]  Hillary and Obama are preparing to announce, running together on a ticket with Hillary,
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.400]  as president, Obama as vice president.
[00:33.400 --> 00:38.200]  The first year is John Bowne's latest report, and we must reclaim American medicine.
[00:38.200 --> 00:43.000]  Hypothetically speaking, you wake up one day and China and the United States have elevated
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.240]  tensions in the South China Sea, Iran, North Korea, and the globalist combine have become
[00:48.240 --> 00:54.200]  a modern-day axis of evil, and now everything made in China is either under embargo or severely
[00:54.200 --> 00:55.200]  limited.
[00:55.200 --> 01:00.120]  How deep of a hole have we dug in the United States when it comes to the supply of necessities
[01:00.120 --> 01:01.920]  we need to survive?
[01:01.920 --> 01:08.200]  Most people don't realize that as much as 90% of the medicine they use comes from China,
[01:08.200 --> 01:13.520]  where pharmaceutical companies avoid U.S. regulations and benefit from lower production
[01:13.520 --> 01:14.520]  costs.
[01:14.520 --> 01:18.600]  China has become the world's largest producer of acetaminophen that's used in everything
[01:18.600 --> 01:22.200]  from theraflute, et cetera, and to pseudofed and beyond.
[01:22.200 --> 01:27.640]  And China is the world's largest producer of vitamin C, annually exporting more than
[01:27.640 --> 01:29.640]  100,000 tons of it.
[01:29.640 --> 01:32.640]  How did America fall into such a deep decline?
[01:32.640 --> 01:35.000]  We can thank the Rockefellers for one.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.640]  John D. Rockefeller upended our healthcare system in the early 20th century.
[01:39.640 --> 01:45.640]  The discovery of petrochemicals led to a vilification of the United States natural, nutritional,
[01:45.640 --> 01:50.480]  and holistic medicine system that was kicked to the curb to establish a pharmaceutical
[01:50.480 --> 01:56.160]  goliath shelling out patented synthetics that only treated symptoms rather than offering
[01:56.160 --> 02:02.400]  cures, while increasing the scope of Rockefeller and his robber baron cohorts monopolies.
[02:02.400 --> 02:07.920]  Years later, David Rockefeller, in league with his globalist crony, saw to the exportation
[02:07.920 --> 02:13.600]  of the pharmaceutical industry, leaving America completely defenseless in an unforeseen time
[02:13.600 --> 02:14.600]  of crisis.
[02:14.600 --> 02:22.640]  The negative impact of population growth on all of our planetary ecosystems is becoming
[02:22.640 --> 02:24.480]  appallingly evident.
[02:24.480 --> 02:29.160]  When we are able to go about our business here in the Americas and around the world
[02:29.160 --> 02:34.240]  with confidence and security, it's because we know the strength of this government stands
[02:34.240 --> 02:35.880]  behind us.
[02:35.880 --> 02:40.800]  For that and for all your other contributions, we thank you very much.
[02:40.800 --> 02:47.160]  Eric, can you be specific about when you met Rockefeller, how it happened in these discussions?
[02:47.160 --> 02:52.400]  I met Rockefeller through a female attorney I knew who called me up one day and said,
[02:52.400 --> 02:54.560]  one of the Rockefellers would like to meet you.
[02:54.560 --> 02:59.920]  I had made a video called Mad as Hell, and he'd seen the video and wanted to meet me
[02:59.920 --> 03:03.120]  and knew I was running for governor of Nevada, so sure, I'd love to meet him.
[03:03.120 --> 03:10.720]  The ultimate goal that these people have in mind is the goal to create a one-world government,
[03:10.720 --> 03:17.680]  run by the banking industry, run by the bankers, and the whole agenda is to create a one-world
[03:17.680 --> 03:24.560]  government where everybody has an RFID chip implanted in them.
[03:24.560 --> 03:33.080]  All money is to be in those chips, right, there'll be no more cash, and this is giving
[03:33.080 --> 03:36.880]  me straight from Rockefeller himself, this is what I want to accomplish, and all money
[03:36.880 --> 03:39.080]  will be in your chips.
[03:39.080 --> 03:46.760]  And so, instead of having cash, any time you have money in your chip, they can take out
[03:46.760 --> 03:49.000]  whatever they want to take out whatever they want to.
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.520]  If they say you owe us this much money in taxes, they just deduct it out of your chip
[03:52.520 --> 03:53.520]  digitally.
[03:53.520 --> 03:54.520]  Total control.
[03:54.520 --> 03:55.520]  Total control.
[03:55.520 --> 04:00.360]  And if you like me or you, and you're protesting what they're doing, they can just turn off
[04:00.360 --> 04:01.440]  your chip.
[04:01.440 --> 04:06.400]  And today, Bill Gates is using the old John D. Rockefeller method of problem reaction
[04:06.400 --> 04:12.640]  solution to con the American citizen into accepting a chip to monitor manufactured antibodies
[04:12.640 --> 04:15.800]  under a Microsoft 5G Big Brother technocracy.
[04:15.800 --> 04:22.440]  I'd say it's ironic if you take somebody who's doing their best to get the world ready, and
[04:22.440 --> 04:29.280]  putting in my case billions of dollars into these tools for infectious diseases, and really
[04:29.280 --> 04:36.120]  trying to solve broadly infectious diseases, including those that can cause pandemics.
[04:36.120 --> 04:41.680]  But that, you know, we're in a crazy situation, so there's going to be crazy rumors.
[04:41.680 --> 04:46.800]  It should have been a wake-up call as iconic American brands like Levi's, Radio Flyer,
[04:46.800 --> 04:47.800]  and even G.I.
[04:47.800 --> 04:49.360]  Joe were made in China.
[04:49.360 --> 04:54.360]  But on the bright side, perhaps a Chinese embargo would finally wake average Americans
[04:54.360 --> 04:56.920]  from their TV zombie slumber.
[04:56.920 --> 05:01.120]  Because we don't make televisions in the United States anymore.
[05:01.120 --> 05:07.760]  In one study's history and human nature, you learn very quickly that rugged individualism
[05:07.760 --> 05:13.560]  and people to think for themselves, build free societies, innovate to amazing things,
[05:13.560 --> 05:19.120]  but those that love to grovel, those that love to be subservient, those that love to
[05:19.120 --> 05:25.440]  comply and think that it's a virtue, they create stagnation, corruption, tyranny, and
[05:25.440 --> 05:28.440]  then finally collapse.
[05:28.440 --> 05:31.360]  And the world is now being tested.
[05:31.360 --> 05:36.200]  And we're seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've complied and submitted their whole
[05:36.200 --> 05:42.120]  lives believing if they just submit now in a bigger way, somehow they'll create a
[05:42.120 --> 05:43.120]  heavenly future.
[05:43.120 --> 05:51.880]  But the technocrats running the global system are oppressive and anti-human and are psychotic
[05:51.880 --> 05:54.640]  and are building an anti-human future.
[05:54.640 --> 06:05.480]  And to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[06:05.480 --> 06:15.960]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[06:15.960 --> 06:26.080]  This is Alex Jones.
[06:26.080 --> 06:27.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[06:27.800 --> 06:34.600]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday Global Transmission.
[06:34.600 --> 06:41.520]  Coming up, I am going to show you the original projections by Billa Melinda Gates and by
[06:41.520 --> 06:51.040]  the different royal college groups in the UK and others on what supposedly was going
[06:51.040 --> 06:52.040]  to happen.
[06:52.040 --> 06:56.640]  You remember their models two months ago and we're going to look at those models across
[06:56.640 --> 06:57.640]  the world now.
[06:57.640 --> 07:02.360]  They're models on Brazil, they're models on America, they're models on the UK, they're
[07:02.360 --> 07:03.360]  models everywhere.
[07:03.360 --> 07:08.120]  In fact, let me just show TV viewers real quick if I could, this right here, maybe put the
[07:08.120 --> 07:10.080]  color one up on screen.
[07:10.080 --> 07:17.080]  This is the estimate that was put out by the Imperial College, they say is the best in
[07:17.080 --> 07:19.280]  the UK, they're actually the worst.
[07:19.280 --> 07:25.400]  And you can see here where Sweden and these folks really actually are versus where they
[07:25.400 --> 07:33.360]  said we would be up here and again, if you're a radio listener, this is 18 times higher
[07:33.360 --> 07:35.040]  than what it actually was.
[07:35.040 --> 07:42.280]  Okay, so they're talking about absolutely massive hundreds of thousands of dead and
[07:42.280 --> 07:49.640]  then you look down here on the bottom and we're talking about not even, not even 5%
[07:49.640 --> 07:51.320]  of what they said.
[07:51.320 --> 07:59.000]  Here is another one right here, now they've changed their models now and they have come
[07:59.000 --> 08:05.480]  out and they have said, this is a new model for TV viewers, you can see it, they have
[08:05.480 --> 08:12.160]  said, oh well, we were predicting that Sweden will have this giant bell of death, but it
[08:12.160 --> 08:13.160]  didn't happen.
[08:13.160 --> 08:19.120]  So now they've moved it down and they say, oh now if you stay locked up, you will.
[08:19.120 --> 08:21.880]  You will not have these massive dead and they just keep moving it and moving it.
[08:21.880 --> 08:27.280]  They're in the same thing in Texas now and we've got this graph showing all the regular
[08:27.280 --> 08:34.000]  heart disease, cancer, flu, homicide, those numbers have all been moved over and put on
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.680]  top of the COVID-19 numbers and that's why they're massively under reporting all of that
[08:39.680 --> 08:47.320]  now to tell you the numbers are there and we have the White House spokesperson's admitting
[08:47.320 --> 08:58.320]  to the world, ladies and gentlemen, to the world that indeed they're counting all deaths
[08:58.320 --> 09:02.880]  that have tested positive for COVID-19 as dying of COVID-19, even if you've died in
[09:02.880 --> 09:07.680]  a car wreck and they test you and then they admit that the test that they've been using
[09:07.680 --> 09:11.960]  is only if you have genetic material showing you may have had a coronavirus, but everybody's
[09:11.960 --> 09:18.880]  had a coronavirus, so anybody that's ever had the antibodies for a regular cold is now
[09:18.880 --> 09:19.880]  testing positive.
[09:19.880 --> 09:24.120]  And by the way, I have an incredible piece of evidence to this right here.
[09:24.120 --> 09:28.560]  More than 370 workers at Pork Plant, Missouri tested positive for coronavirus.
[09:28.560 --> 09:30.760]  All were asymptomatic.
[09:30.760 --> 09:36.120]  They were not sick because the test it says they gave was for the genetic material of
[09:36.120 --> 09:43.200]  the coronavirus because again, it's like having a hundred breeds of pigs, but only
[09:43.200 --> 09:49.360]  one is the COVID-19, but they give you a test to see if you're a pig and everybody else
[09:49.360 --> 09:55.280]  that's the other type of pigs now test positive as a COVID-19 pig, but you're not a COVID-19
[09:55.280 --> 09:56.280]  pig.
[09:56.280 --> 09:58.440]  By the way, folks, this is all admitted.
[09:58.440 --> 10:00.880]  I've gone and read the literature for months on this.
[10:00.880 --> 10:04.120]  This is all completely and totally confirmed.
[10:04.120 --> 10:09.920]  So coming up at the start of the next hour, I am going to walk through Brazil.
[10:09.920 --> 10:13.560]  I'm going to walk through the U.K. I'm going to walk through the U.S. I'm going to walk
[10:13.560 --> 10:14.560]  through Canada.
[10:14.560 --> 10:18.080]  I'm going to walk through all these places and I'm going to walk through also if you
[10:18.080 --> 10:22.840]  look at New York or other Democrat control areas, that's where almost all the deaths
[10:22.840 --> 10:27.720]  are because that's where they're total criminals running things and ordering the hospitals
[10:27.720 --> 10:31.680]  to say everything is COVID-19, even if they've not been tested.
[10:31.680 --> 10:37.120]  Now that's been admitted and Project Veritas caught it on tape.
[10:37.120 --> 10:40.840]  So they're using every trick in the book they can to keep people in fear.
[10:40.840 --> 10:41.840]  And this is a fact.
[10:41.840 --> 10:47.600]  Balasaro, when they lost 5,000 people so far a few days ago in months in Brazil, said
[10:47.600 --> 10:48.600]  so what?
[10:48.600 --> 10:53.800]  I'm sorry they died, but we lose hundreds of thousands every year from colds and flus.
[10:53.800 --> 10:55.560]  He goes, so what am I supposed to do?
[10:55.560 --> 10:56.560]  Shut everything down.
[10:56.560 --> 10:59.240]  We all starved to death.
[10:59.240 --> 11:00.840]  So that's all coming up.
[11:00.840 --> 11:05.680]  This is conclusive, 370 workers test positive at one meet back in plan.
[11:05.680 --> 11:06.680]  They shut it down.
[11:06.680 --> 11:13.480]  Oh, it's everybody's got to go home and quarantine because they have antibodies for the coronavirus,
[11:13.480 --> 11:15.480]  the common cold.
[11:15.480 --> 11:17.880]  Almost everyone has antibodies for that.
[11:17.880 --> 11:20.080]  You understand that?
[11:20.080 --> 11:25.880]  Now they think antibodies hang around 5, 10, 15 years depending on the pathogen.
[11:25.880 --> 11:28.600]  So that's why some people have not had a cold in 10, 15 years.
[11:28.600 --> 11:33.000]  So they don't show up for it, but it's maybe 10% they estimate.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.280]  So 90% of us are going to test positive.
[11:35.280 --> 11:39.440]  That's why when they said three months ago, oh, 70-something percent.
[11:39.440 --> 11:45.560]  Remember when Gavin Newsom said, oh, 70%, 75% of California is going to test positive.
[11:45.560 --> 11:46.560]  What was the exact number?
[11:46.560 --> 11:47.960]  He said 79, didn't he?
[11:47.960 --> 11:48.960]  Look up.
[11:48.960 --> 11:50.800]  Gavin Newsom says 79.
[11:50.800 --> 11:54.640]  Because they know the doctors told him, sir, everyone's going to test positive.
[11:54.640 --> 11:56.200]  Everyone's basically had the cold.
[11:56.200 --> 12:00.080]  In fact, you're tough if you haven't had a cold in 10, 15 years.
[12:00.080 --> 12:03.840]  And that's the people that don't even show up with the genetic material in their body
[12:03.840 --> 12:06.480]  that they've beaten it.
[12:06.480 --> 12:10.960]  This is a galactic super mega fraud of biblical proportions.
[12:10.960 --> 12:16.480]  Now let me say this right now before we go to break and come back with the big news.
[12:16.480 --> 12:20.000]  Reuters is reporting the Chinese military is preparing for war and believes the United
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.680]  States is going to attack the articles on info wars.com leaked memo Chinese leaders
[12:24.680 --> 12:28.640]  born of armed confrontation with US and coronavirus backlash report.
[12:28.640 --> 12:34.800]  And again, more news is breaking that Fauci indeed ran the Wuhan lab coronavirus research
[12:34.800 --> 12:41.040]  along with Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation operatives who run fact checking for Facebook.
[12:41.040 --> 12:43.360]  You cannot make this up.
[12:43.360 --> 12:47.760]  So Bill and Melinda Gates and Fauci are in control of Facebook fact checking, shutting
[12:47.760 --> 12:52.520]  you down and banning medical doctors when they go on air and contradict what Bill and
[12:52.520 --> 12:57.960]  Melinda Gates say this is an information warfare takeover of medicine of communication of science
[12:57.960 --> 12:58.960]  of everything.
[12:58.960 --> 12:59.960]  Now let me get into this.
[12:59.960 --> 13:05.720]  So I want to cover this right now was a big controversy when I came out last Tuesday and
[13:05.720 --> 13:13.640]  I was going along with the satire of Jonathan Swift 1730 saying he would eat Irish children
[13:13.640 --> 13:17.920]  because the Irish were subhuman because no one was taking care of the Irish and was overtaxing
[13:17.920 --> 13:20.320]  them and over regulating them and they were starving to death.
[13:20.320 --> 13:26.880]  And so he said, because he was Irish, he said, how about we just start eating the Irish babies
[13:26.880 --> 13:31.040]  and he published it like it was serious and it's the most famous satire in the world.
[13:31.040 --> 13:35.920]  So I did a whole piece showing real articles from the UN about 30 plus million starving
[13:35.920 --> 13:38.600]  to death right now 135 million set to starve to death.
[13:38.600 --> 13:42.560]  I played the head of the world food program talking about it.
[13:42.560 --> 13:49.040]  And then I said, well, fine, once all the food runs out, I'll just eat my liberal neighbors
[13:49.040 --> 13:52.360]  knowing they'd pick it up, but they edited it down to one minute.
[13:52.360 --> 13:57.360]  I did it to draw attention to the starvation because when the first world collapses, the
[13:57.360 --> 13:59.320]  third world dies.
[13:59.320 --> 14:01.040]  And so here's the articles AP.
[14:01.040 --> 14:07.040]  We don't know how it will end hunger stocks amid crisis in the United States, frantic
[14:07.040 --> 14:12.160]  meat shortages of Americans turned to hunting during pandemic coronavirus pandemic could
[14:12.160 --> 14:15.360]  push 130 million to bring starvation AP.
[14:15.360 --> 14:20.920]  Now again, it's the UN doing all this, but now saying coronavirus did it know the lockdown
[14:20.920 --> 14:22.800]  did it.
[14:22.800 --> 14:25.880]  Some media actually understood that it was a modest proposal understood it was satire,
[14:25.880 --> 14:28.680]  but the deaths are very, very real.
[14:28.680 --> 14:34.160]  So here's what I'm saying listeners war with China, the Democrats trying to cancel the election,
[14:34.160 --> 14:37.200]  all the crazy stuff that's going on and things I know that are going on behind the scenes
[14:37.200 --> 14:40.380]  with it with a deep state plan to take Trump out.
[14:40.380 --> 14:41.640]  You need to get prepared.
[14:41.640 --> 14:42.640]  You need to get ready.
[14:42.640 --> 14:46.680]  If you ever wanted an info wars t-shirt so that you can fight the third dimension to
[14:46.680 --> 14:49.480]  spread the word with our great new t-shirt I've got over here.
[14:49.480 --> 14:52.480]  Let me just show it to you.
[14:52.480 --> 14:53.560]  Just show this to you.
[14:53.560 --> 14:56.120]  This is 5g kills.
[14:56.120 --> 14:57.120]  Great new t-shirt.
[14:57.120 --> 14:58.600]  I don't know how long info wars will be here.
[14:58.600 --> 15:02.000]  I've never talked like this before, but I'll just tell you that when they run to martial
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.880]  law and take the president out, the first thing they're going to do is arrest me or kill
[15:04.880 --> 15:05.880]  me.
[15:05.880 --> 15:06.880]  I know they're trying to line that up right now.
[15:06.880 --> 15:09.320]  So we can ship these out to you in a couple days.
[15:09.320 --> 15:12.440]  Food takes longer than that, but we can ship these out to you usually the next day after
[15:12.440 --> 15:13.440]  you order it.
[15:13.440 --> 15:14.440]  Usually get it in three days.
[15:14.440 --> 15:15.440]  Anywhere in the U.S.
[15:15.440 --> 15:17.160]  5g kills on the front.
[15:17.160 --> 15:18.560]  Very powerful on the back.
[15:18.560 --> 15:21.280]  Infowars.com have a piece of history here.
[15:21.280 --> 15:24.120]  We're probably going to beat them folks, but there's a good chance we're not.
[15:24.120 --> 15:26.920]  Everything's going to get shut down and it'll be permanent martial law and after they kill
[15:26.920 --> 15:30.280]  Trump they'll tell you to stay in your house forever because of viruses.
[15:30.280 --> 15:32.640]  We have another one right here that just came in.
[15:32.640 --> 15:36.160]  We've got these in stock right now and it shows the evolution of man.
[15:36.160 --> 15:41.120]  If you believe the evolutionist, it's funny from the monkey, which I don't believe, up
[15:41.120 --> 15:46.160]  until humans today and then 5g kills us and kills humanity, and that's got infowars.com
[15:46.160 --> 15:47.160]  on the back as well.
[15:47.160 --> 15:50.240]  So get your swarable food while you still can, get your vitamins and minerals because
[15:50.240 --> 15:53.240]  we can be swat-teamed and killed at any moment.
[15:53.240 --> 15:55.240]  The country's going into total war with China.
[15:55.240 --> 15:57.800]  They've got a fifth column inside the U.S. that's called the Democratic Party.
[15:57.800 --> 15:58.800]  They are terrorist.
[15:58.800 --> 16:03.800]  Ten weeks ago, I began to tell listeners they need to get high-quality swarable food not
[16:03.800 --> 16:09.320]  because of the virus, but because of the crises and the economic shutdown it would cause because
[16:09.320 --> 16:13.720]  the globe was for planning to hold America hostage and run a blockade through the blue
[16:13.720 --> 16:15.680]  cities and blue states.
[16:15.680 --> 16:20.120]  Now that prediction has come true because the globalists are running an operation.
[16:20.120 --> 16:22.040]  It's not predictions.
[16:22.040 --> 16:24.360]  We have their battle plans.
[16:24.360 --> 16:29.040]  So going back more than eight weeks ago, all major swarable food companies were sold out
[16:29.040 --> 16:32.640]  except my patriot supply because they're the biggest of our preposition.
[16:32.640 --> 16:36.440]  When it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't be
[16:36.440 --> 16:38.080]  able to fulfill them in a timely manner.
[16:38.080 --> 16:40.720]  They stopped taking orders until they got caught back up.
[16:40.720 --> 16:42.280]  Well, now they're caught back up.
[16:42.280 --> 16:46.520]  They've got high-quality swarble food in stock, ready to be packaged and shipped to you.
[16:46.520 --> 16:51.600]  Get your orders in now at infowarstore.com to go right at the head of the queue and get
[16:51.600 --> 16:54.560]  delivered to you as fast as possible and from the employer.
[16:54.560 --> 16:58.080]  Get your swarble food now at infowarstore.com.
[16:58.080 --> 16:59.920]  How do you put a people under house arrest?
[16:59.920 --> 17:01.560]  How do you put them under siege?
[17:01.560 --> 17:06.880]  Well, you tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up with
[17:06.880 --> 17:12.280]  the globalist deep state and then had China release to then take down the populist president
[17:12.280 --> 17:16.480]  and those pesky American people that have become too uppity.
[17:16.480 --> 17:19.080]  Bill Ma or even admitted it, man, I hope we have a depression.
[17:19.080 --> 17:24.040]  Now they've tailored the whole thing with the big corporations and the media are going
[17:24.040 --> 17:29.160]  to keep the country closed along with the help of the blue cities and blue states all the
[17:29.160 --> 17:34.480]  time blaming Trump and capitalism and Americanism for the depression it creates.
[17:34.480 --> 17:39.640]  If America is that stupid, we deserve what happens to us, but as for me, I'm not sitting
[17:39.640 --> 17:41.360]  here and I'm not taking it.
[17:41.360 --> 17:45.200]  It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the good people keeping everybody
[17:45.200 --> 17:46.200]  safe.
[17:46.200 --> 17:47.840]  But that's not what they're doing.
[17:47.840 --> 17:53.680]  They are pulling America up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings, our health,
[17:53.680 --> 18:01.760]  our whole world and committing millions of third world people to death.
[18:01.760 --> 18:26.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:26.080 --> 18:33.760]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance live from the info wars.com
[18:33.760 --> 18:34.960]  studios.
[18:34.960 --> 18:38.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[18:38.360 --> 18:45.600]  America is in the fight of its life right now against a axis of evil, global corporations
[18:45.600 --> 18:52.640]  that engage in siege, mutiny, a clamp down ally with blue cities and blue states with
[18:52.640 --> 18:59.600]  the communist Chinese, the EU and Hollywood, a consortium of godless America, capitalism,
[18:59.600 --> 19:01.840]  freedom, hating trash.
[19:01.840 --> 19:09.280]  The ultra rich are the ones funding the socialism and communism to get the public domesticated,
[19:09.280 --> 19:14.440]  but really all they're bringing in is world corporate fascism.
[19:14.440 --> 19:20.040]  Now again, the virus is real, it's patented, it's a bio weapon, so Bill and Melinda Gates
[19:20.040 --> 19:26.640]  Foundation can own it and own the vaccine that comes out for it.
[19:26.640 --> 19:32.120]  They could never have one for a coronavirus because that is the most common type of virus
[19:32.120 --> 19:35.760]  that can get you sick.
[19:35.760 --> 19:41.880]  But they wanted it to be a camera coronavirus so that when they tested everyone, they would
[19:41.880 --> 19:49.520]  test positive for it because the test that they have out there is testing the one they've
[19:49.520 --> 19:53.240]  given everybody, that they admit gives a lot of false positives, well of course it gives
[19:53.240 --> 19:56.760]  a lot of false positives, they're covering their ass, it's almost all false positives
[19:56.760 --> 20:03.160]  because if you have the genetic material of a fight that you've had with the coronavirus
[20:03.160 --> 20:07.160]  in your life, it's going to show up, and again here's even CNN.
[20:07.160 --> 20:12.480]  More than 370 workers at pork plant in Missouri tested positive for coronavirus all were
[20:12.480 --> 20:20.000]  asymptomatic, meaning none of them were sick, none of them felt bad.
[20:20.000 --> 20:27.920]  They only have 352 deaths statewide, and that's mostly people that came in sick from something
[20:27.920 --> 20:32.920]  else and then when they test them and they go, oh you test positive because they had
[20:32.920 --> 20:41.320]  genetic material from a coronavirus infection sometime in the last 5, 10, 15 years, it varies
[20:41.320 --> 20:47.640]  on the person, but if you've had a cold in 10 to 15 years, you are going to test positive.
[20:47.640 --> 20:52.880]  I know I keep harping on this folks, but this is incredible hoax.
[20:52.880 --> 20:58.360]  And you look at all their graphs, all their models, and now you notice they're saying,
[20:58.360 --> 21:03.040]  oh the same Imperial College that gave us these graphs that were 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 times
[21:03.040 --> 21:08.120]  off now says sorry, life's never going back to normal.
[21:08.120 --> 21:13.120]  Now I told you all this was going to happen 12 weeks ago, I also told you Hillary was
[21:13.120 --> 21:17.520]  planning to run in a broker convention, that's why they had a weak field of candidates, and
[21:17.520 --> 21:22.240]  now the Hill reports top Democrats say they're preparing Hillary to run as president, Obama
[21:22.240 --> 21:29.840]  as vice president, and that Biden will step down at the convention.
[21:29.840 --> 21:34.920]  Insider Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama ticket could replace Joe Biden, this is the plan,
[21:34.920 --> 21:37.160]  you're like it's unconstitutional, it's criminal.
[21:37.160 --> 21:42.160]  They don't care, they will do it, the media will back them.
[21:42.160 --> 21:46.240]  They have their criminals stay behind networks inside the different government agencies,
[21:46.240 --> 21:52.360]  that's not the whole government, but they operate as a literal fifth column against the country.
[21:52.360 --> 21:57.840]  Now a former top general went public over the weekend and is exposing that there is
[21:57.840 --> 22:01.440]  a fifth column called the Democratic Party that works for the Communist Chinese in America,
[22:01.440 --> 22:06.960]  because that's the reality, we'll play that coming up next segment.
[22:06.960 --> 22:12.760]  But first I want to play this clip, it's up on infowars.com.
[22:12.760 --> 22:16.960]  Democrat XCI agent says, Comey must get the death penalty if found guilty of treason, a
[22:16.960 --> 22:17.960]  Jamie White article.
[22:17.960 --> 22:23.000]  Disgrace former FBI director James Comey could face the death penalty if found guilty for
[22:23.000 --> 22:28.360]  weaponizing FBI against Donald Trump and his campaign 2016 according to XCI agent, Democrat
[22:28.360 --> 22:30.080]  Brian Dean Wright.
[22:30.080 --> 22:31.760]  Let's hear from him on Fox News.
[22:31.760 --> 22:34.960]  What do you think if anything should happen to James Comey then, what's your opinion
[22:34.960 --> 22:35.960]  on that?
[22:35.960 --> 22:36.960]  My preference?
[22:36.960 --> 22:40.400]  I'd love to see the death penalty and boy oh boy I'll tell you if I could flip the switch
[22:40.400 --> 22:42.040]  myself I'd do it.
[22:42.040 --> 22:47.400]  Because these men are traitors, they absolutely assaulted not just the Trump administration
[22:47.400 --> 22:54.120]  but your vote, my vote and anybody who went to the ballot box in 2016 irrespective of who
[22:54.120 --> 22:58.520]  we voted for, they decided that they were going to choose the nation's political winners
[22:58.520 --> 22:59.520]  and losers.
[22:59.520 --> 23:07.920]  All right, let me come back, I'm going to play the former general saying the same thing.
[23:07.920 --> 23:15.160]  But I want people to understand I don't get up here with this rhetoric to just scare people,
[23:15.160 --> 23:17.040]  I get up here because it's the truth.
[23:17.040 --> 23:21.920]  Now occasionally I engage in satire maybe every week or two and that usually is what
[23:21.920 --> 23:25.920]  the media picks up and I'm really tempted to stop doing it even though it's a successful
[23:25.920 --> 23:27.960]  way of getting us a lot of new listeners.
[23:27.960 --> 23:33.080]  I like to engage in satire because it's so disgusting that we're letting 135 million
[23:33.080 --> 23:37.040]  people slide towards certain starvation and death, 30 million now currently starving to
[23:37.040 --> 23:38.040]  death.
[23:38.040 --> 23:41.320]  That's the UN's own numbers and I believe those are accurate numbers.
[23:41.320 --> 23:45.920]  So again the globalist UN creates the problem then offers a solution oh give us billions
[23:45.920 --> 23:51.440]  of dollars to go save people who they then don't even save, they do a few photo ops
[23:51.440 --> 23:56.080]  and the supermodel that goes to the photo ops thinks he's actually saving people.
[23:56.080 --> 24:04.280]  But I did come out on last Tuesday and say well if everything collapses this road warrior
[24:04.280 --> 24:08.160]  I guess I'll just eat my liberal neighbors pointing out how serious this is that when
[24:08.160 --> 24:12.800]  the first world collapses the third world dies and I'm trying to get that out there
[24:12.800 --> 24:16.480]  as a hashtag I'm trying to get that out because it's really true and the globalists know in
[24:16.480 --> 24:22.480]  all their studies that if they cut carbon by about 50% in the west that will kill over
[24:22.480 --> 24:25.160]  a billion people in a decade.
[24:25.160 --> 24:26.720]  That's a billion people.
[24:26.720 --> 24:33.520]  Billamonigates push to get hydroxychloroquine banned in Africa to not get UN funding for
[24:33.520 --> 24:37.840]  that so people die in mass there because that about a half billion people.
[24:37.840 --> 24:44.120]  Madagascar is now shipping their own natural hydroxychloroquine out and Billamonigates
[24:44.120 --> 24:49.040]  are trying to block that being shipped to the Africans because it doesn't just stop
[24:49.040 --> 24:54.200]  according to their studies in Madagascar medical doctors malaria which is a fact it also takes
[24:54.200 --> 24:58.360]  out and builds your immune system ahead of time according to doctors and I have that
[24:58.360 --> 25:04.120]  clip coming up as well it's on international television out of the Middle East so they
[25:04.120 --> 25:09.080]  don't know what to do ladies and gentlemen this is all coming out this is all happening
[25:09.080 --> 25:13.120]  and Africa doesn't want to die and I don't want to be overrun by African third world
[25:13.120 --> 25:19.040]  populations that are used as Democrat voters but I don't want them to starve to be killed
[25:19.040 --> 25:22.840]  so we need to stabilize Africa stabilize the Middle East stabilize Latin America stabilize
[25:22.840 --> 25:27.320]  Asia bring first world systems to them then their populations will stabilize but if you
[25:27.320 --> 25:31.080]  don't ever let them develop it's just gonna get worse and worse that's the globalist plan
[25:31.080 --> 25:39.080]  so that's all coming up but this is an incredibly serious time to be alive and everyone's saying
[25:39.080 --> 25:45.880]  be a hero the medical workers are heroes don't ever go outside again your shutdown is just
[25:45.880 --> 25:50.840]  gonna make you be in a depression you're killing millions of people when you go around grandstanding
[25:50.840 --> 25:55.080]  with the mask you go around grandstanding how good you are you go around grandstanding
[25:55.080 --> 25:59.240]  uh that you know you're better than other people and your virtue signaling I know a
[25:59.240 --> 26:03.000]  lot of you just want to help you want to be friendly you want to look like uh that you
[26:03.000 --> 26:10.280]  are you know at least complying but the mask and all of that is part of the fear and it's
[26:10.280 --> 26:15.480]  part of the mind control and it's part of the manipulation because China is at war with America
[26:15.480 --> 26:22.520]  but fear of the virus is the real enemy and it's what's powerful and so we have to break that fear
[26:22.520 --> 26:26.680]  and that's why the mainstream media don't want you to know about zinc hydroxychloroquine
[26:26.680 --> 26:33.560]  vitamin d vitamin c uh silver topically that's why they're just arresting medical doctors that
[26:33.560 --> 26:38.280]  give people vitamin c swat damning them with machine guns because big pharma and the global
[26:38.280 --> 26:42.520]  is through control of this country they've had a coup and it's time to remove them the russia coup
[26:42.520 --> 26:47.080]  didn't work ukraine coup didn't work but the medical tyranny is on available in the gates of
[26:47.080 --> 26:53.000]  a program where every person they kill saying they have COVID-19 and they get $39,000 and the blue
[26:53.000 --> 26:58.600]  states they're murdering people in those hospitals while they drink vodka and have sex was only four
[26:58.600 --> 27:06.760]  months ago that I warned president trap and the american people that calvary would never stand for

[29:41.960 --> 29:46.760]  as well so this is a real innovation i don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand
[29:46.760 --> 29:52.840]  sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out smells great it's so
[29:52.840 --> 30:08.760]  refreshing this is a big winner you're listening to the alex jones show
[30:08.760 --> 30:25.400]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[30:25.400 --> 30:33.400]  go
[30:33.560 --> 30:38.520]  compliance with the lockdown means hundreds of millions of people will starve to death the
[30:38.520 --> 30:42.200]  next year and a half that is now official that is now confirmed
[30:46.280 --> 30:54.440]  and the depression that is already hitting the united states will be devastating for generations
[30:54.440 --> 31:00.440]  to come and out of the poverty that comes from it all major colleges will no longer be for the
[31:00.440 --> 31:05.080]  general public everybody else will tell a conference most jobs will be obsolete you're
[31:05.080 --> 31:11.000]  going to see the robot takeover the driverless cars the whole system because after all humans
[31:11.000 --> 31:17.000]  can't be in contact with each other we can't shake hands we can't get on airplanes this is the lockdown
[31:17.000 --> 31:22.440]  this is the takeover this is the post human world this is the giant leap into the future
[31:22.440 --> 31:28.440]  but the nwo had promised they were going to bring us this is the mass culling when the first world
[31:28.440 --> 31:33.080]  collapses the third world dies and we're third world and then we are slowly collapsed as well
[31:33.720 --> 31:38.840]  this is the takedown of the western dream the takedown of the renaissance the death of egalitarianism
[31:39.640 --> 31:45.640]  the death of true liberalism wrapped in a neo-liberal fabric of sickening technocracy
[31:45.640 --> 31:57.160]  now here is general robert spaulding recently retired breaking down the fact that we are at war
[31:58.280 --> 32:03.960]  with china and its surrogates its fifth column right now america is to survive and what i mean
[32:03.960 --> 32:08.840]  by that is if it's going to continue as a democratic constitutional republic then americans are going
[32:08.840 --> 32:12.760]  to have to stand up and fight for it it's not going to be given to you free it's not going to be
[32:12.760 --> 32:17.400]  handed to your children or grandchildren for free you know our founding fathers had to fight for it
[32:17.400 --> 32:24.040]  you know along the the the 240 plus years of our existence people had to stand up and fight
[32:24.040 --> 32:30.200]  the fight is just different this this time and you don't have to go you know pick up a weapon and
[32:30.200 --> 32:35.800]  go fight in some faraway land you have to fight for democracy right here at home by recognizing
[32:35.800 --> 32:41.880]  that democracy here is under assault look at what happened with the nba it's clear as day
[32:41.880 --> 32:47.560]  if you choose to look at it so in a way we're already in world war three we are in world war
[32:47.560 --> 32:53.640]  three and you are in the front lines i am now in the front lines i when i had a uniform on i was
[32:53.640 --> 32:58.200]  you know working in the government i wasn't really paying attention but now i'm fully woke
[32:58.200 --> 33:04.600]  and i'm taking up the battle cry and this is uh one of the ways that i'm doing it we are at war
[33:04.600 --> 33:08.520]  with china but we're at war with the powerful consortium that put them in charge now i've been
[33:08.520 --> 33:16.680]  hammering this for 20 plus years i'd say about 23 years of my 26 years on air i wasn't that up on
[33:16.680 --> 33:21.720]  china i knew a lot about it but i didn't understand that i knew it was a globalist control zone
[33:22.360 --> 33:27.000]  but i sort of read the cfr reports saying the 21st century will be a chinese communist one
[33:27.000 --> 33:32.120]  as data rockefeller envisioned so i started reading new york times articles he wrote a loving
[33:32.120 --> 33:37.480]  mousetown and mass death and how they were the model and everything would be here and people
[33:37.480 --> 33:41.640]  thought come on china is not that powerful and then we saw the unlevel playing field that have
[33:41.640 --> 33:47.640]  been established to create this and then i've been under chinese communist propaganda attack
[33:47.640 --> 33:53.560]  for at least six years i mean they fund the direct attacks i've had them do other dirty tricks and
[33:53.560 --> 33:59.960]  that's who most these internet companies work for it's it's it's who runs the show and that's why
[33:59.960 --> 34:05.560]  you see the washington post headline well last year gg ping must destroy trump to save america
[34:05.560 --> 34:14.840]  save us gg ping that has three million muslims in death camps liberals love that all the sudden i
[34:14.840 --> 34:21.320]  just don't want to have sharia law and import 10 million muslims over here and you know but the
[34:21.320 --> 34:25.960]  chinese muslims are very well-behaved people well there i wouldn't have a problem with the
[34:25.960 --> 34:29.960]  wiggers being brought over here i've met a lot of them i know about them they're in death camps
[34:29.960 --> 34:35.080]  but that's like oh that's sexy because tim cook owns a bunch of factories literally you know he
[34:35.080 --> 34:40.840]  goes like this like bill gates long as you go uh uh you know we're gonna air next hour at least
[34:40.840 --> 34:46.120]  30 minutes of this latest david ike interview with brian rose where they streamed it on their own
[34:46.120 --> 34:54.600]  platform just last night got over a million people watching it simultaneously and i can see the numbers
[34:55.480 --> 34:59.480]  and we're gonna get brian on the show tomorrow and get icone soon but but icke really lays out the
[34:59.480 --> 35:06.040]  full compendium you know smooth way unlike mine machine gun buzz saw away and so it's not that i
[35:06.040 --> 35:12.200]  don't want to be on air next hour but i'm gonna air a big chunk of this the first first 35 minutes
[35:12.200 --> 35:18.440]  is just over the top penetrating laid out absolutely perfectly now ike believes that viruses are just
[35:18.440 --> 35:24.760]  something released by cells as a detoxification format and that's part of it but but i don't agree
[35:24.760 --> 35:31.720]  with that that view but other than that what he says is deadly accurate and what he lays out the
[35:31.720 --> 35:36.920]  spoken word way i could sit here and show you articles and documents for everything he's saying
[35:36.920 --> 35:41.240]  in fact i'm gonna get one of the editors probably rob do he's one of the most researched on these
[35:41.240 --> 35:55.960]  subjects go through all of the documents and all the things that ike says in his report
[35:58.360 --> 36:02.440]  and just back up what he's saying because they're not putting any articles or video clips up on
[36:02.440 --> 36:07.800]  screen while he's talking but everything he's saying is on record and documented except one thing
[36:07.800 --> 36:15.400]  and that's why he got banned on facebook that's why he got banned on twitter speaking of
[36:16.360 --> 36:22.840]  covid 19 i don't cough like this except when i'm in this new studio and i think we should
[36:22.840 --> 36:28.520]  have the air conditioners checked in here because my wife was watching the show last night the Sunday
[36:28.520 --> 36:33.480]  show she's like gotta keep pausing to cough and and yeah it's it's when i come in here maybe it's
[36:33.480 --> 36:39.880]  because the air conditioners right above me but it just makes my makes me cough and makes my bronchiol
[36:39.880 --> 36:44.920]  sees up so we need to have these air conditions air conditioners inspected or looked up something
[36:44.920 --> 36:49.400]  something's going on you know it's like certain hotels i get in my throat gets really really dry
[36:50.440 --> 36:57.000]  i start hacking like where is my this is not a plug but it is a plug oh yes i forgot about this
[36:57.000 --> 37:06.840]  this is a lunk lunk cleanse huh they're good people have been saying too they noticed that my uh
[37:07.560 --> 37:11.720]  i saw nurses and stuff on the website last night going how much you've got polyps on your larynx i
[37:11.720 --> 37:16.280]  guarantee you've got to get that checked people are like do you have throat cancer you know i have
[37:16.280 --> 37:24.040]  not had a checkup since uh i was like 42 and i definitely screamed too loud a lot of demonstrations
[37:24.040 --> 37:29.640]  over the years and so that's why my voice got very very deep um this is not a put on with my voice
[37:29.640 --> 37:35.080]  and it it does need a good rest at some point uh but i'm told if i do have polyps which i undoubtedly
[37:35.080 --> 37:43.560]  do it would put me out for up to six weeks of not being able to talk if i had the polyps removed
[37:43.560 --> 37:47.880]  and then my voice would be a lot better but i do think i need to go get a checkup because it is
[37:47.880 --> 37:55.240]  going from being very deep very baritone to sounding like rocks being put into a blender so i am aware
[37:55.240 --> 38:02.120]  of that and a lot of folks like my voice i personally don't like it and so maybe i should
[38:02.120 --> 38:08.520]  start just speaking the very front of my mouth like this where i whisper because uh that's what's
[38:08.520 --> 38:13.640]  happening to my voice and i apologize for it but that's just the way it is and it gets exacerbated
[38:13.640 --> 38:18.600]  with whatever is in this room by the way i guess i'll turn this into a plug
[38:20.120 --> 38:25.640]  most of your throat or palate cleansers have maybe one or two essential oils or some mental
[38:25.640 --> 38:30.840]  and it's nothing but alcohol this is incredibly thick syrupy so sometimes you got to pull the
[38:30.840 --> 38:34.520]  top off under hot water to get the sprayer cleaned out if you haven't used it in a while
[38:34.520 --> 38:40.520]  but this has a whole list of high quality essential oils uh in it and nothing else works like it
[38:40.520 --> 38:45.800]  and when my voice goes out at home sometimes i realize oh my gosh why i don't have a bottle
[38:45.800 --> 38:50.520]  of lung cleanse here and lung cleanse is available at info wars store dot com and believe me we need
[38:50.520 --> 38:55.720]  a lot of money around here to operate the democrats filed 40 plus lawsuits on us we knocked them down
[38:55.720 --> 39:00.520]  to six they followed three more and i'm fighting some of the biggest democratic law firms in the
[39:00.520 --> 39:05.080]  country that want to shut this completely off but two plus years later after the suits were filed
[39:05.080 --> 39:11.640]  we are winning they are losing but i need a lot of money sugar that worked i need a lot of money
[39:11.640 --> 39:17.720]  in our war chest to find this operation and yes we've got other challenges going on that

[44:01.640 --> 44:14.280]  alex jones show
[44:14.280 --> 44:24.440]  folks if i sound frantic here on air if i sound desperate i am did you hear me play that
[44:25.400 --> 44:31.800]  former high-level cia operative as a democrat on fox news saying we're gonna have to arrest and
[44:31.800 --> 44:35.960]  execute the deep state people people don't say that just to sound tough
[44:38.680 --> 44:44.040]  it's us or them it's communist china and their whole way of life which is total death or it's us
[44:44.040 --> 44:48.920]  now citizens don't need to get violent and people in the government don't need to get violent
[44:50.040 --> 44:54.040]  but we need to identify who the third column is who the enemies are and stop
[44:54.040 --> 45:01.480]  putting up with it and we need durham and bar to understand that if they don't indict all the
[45:01.480 --> 45:09.960]  conspirators of comey then you green light their continued arrogance and criminal action against
[45:09.960 --> 45:15.400]  the american people for too long everyone's been intimidated by these people and it's time
[45:16.280 --> 45:23.800]  to hold the line hold fast and get rid of these people you arrest these individuals they'll hold
[45:23.800 --> 45:28.520]  they will fold like a house of cards and obviously they know about dirt in the government americans
[45:28.520 --> 45:34.120]  don't care about stuff like that at a point like this they don't want a depression they don't want
[45:34.120 --> 45:40.760]  a war we have to be strong or china and their moles will continue to push it until the country
[45:40.760 --> 45:48.120]  goes into a civil war china has predicted hell it was like eight years ago we ought to find it
[45:48.120 --> 45:53.080]  it was a tv ad they put out in china about how they financed the civil war and the collapse of
[45:53.080 --> 45:58.200]  america and now we learn what i already said months ago even in the new york times a week ago
[45:58.200 --> 46:05.880]  that china is trying to foment a civil war i'm trying to stop the civil war but you've got
[46:05.880 --> 46:10.840]  former retired generals you've got former cia people telling you there is a third there's a
[46:10.840 --> 46:16.600]  fifth column in this country and that's why you see more and more democrats coming out and saying
[46:16.600 --> 46:23.320]  i'm not with the fifth column i am not with foreign powers and corporations trying to overthrow the
[46:23.320 --> 46:29.960]  government let me tell you what's going to happen if hillary clinton gets in with obama again
[46:29.960 --> 46:34.360]  because they are chai kong globalist agents all the way the cfr of the new world order has been
[46:34.360 --> 46:40.600]  heavily investing in china for 50 years and plan for them to take over the world that's public
[46:41.480 --> 46:45.880]  and they positioned us to collapse but it's not going the way they thought it was but
[46:45.880 --> 46:53.400]  their operatives are all so dug in right now that they can go out and prosecute in jurisdictions
[46:53.400 --> 46:59.480]  they still control the democrats still control federally and state a ham sandwich a general flin
[47:00.440 --> 47:05.720]  and so many others that you've seen them go after that you've seen them persecute and so that's why
[47:05.720 --> 47:11.080]  there's this rain of terror and fear and everyone giving in to them insider hillary clinton
[47:11.080 --> 47:16.840]  barack obama ticket could replace joe biden a hillary clinton barack obama ticket to replace
[47:16.840 --> 47:23.320]  joe biden isn't even possible douglas mckinnon a former writer for george h.w. bush and ronald
[47:23.320 --> 47:29.960]  reagan had an editorial for the hill on saturday revealing that many democrats are secretly worried
[47:29.960 --> 47:36.280]  about biden's presidential prospects and of course the george w bush supporter comes out and basically
[47:36.280 --> 47:42.360]  says oh it's constitutional even though it's not i looked it up and notice you've got george
[47:42.360 --> 47:50.280]  w bush coming out saying oh trump's being partisan he's being mean to the democrats
[47:50.280 --> 47:54.920]  we need to not be partisan the democrats have been completely partisan from the beginning
[47:54.920 --> 48:01.880]  against trump trying to block him blocking chinese flying here then blaming him for everything
[48:01.880 --> 48:07.320]  that's happening then lying about what's going on then covering up for communist china and then when
[48:07.320 --> 48:17.240]  trump stands up to them here comes george w bush out from under the rocks to defend the democrats
[48:17.240 --> 48:22.120]  because it's the deep state george w bush we're not partisan combatants in a fight against
[48:22.120 --> 48:28.440]  coronavirus really you're not well how come the democrats then continue to act like that
[48:28.440 --> 48:34.120]  so these people are sharing power and they believe it's always the way it was and they believe
[48:34.120 --> 48:39.560]  they're gonna stay in power but that's not what's happening even if they killed trump even if they
[48:39.560 --> 48:44.840]  put me in prison the american people are never going back to the way they were and that's why
[48:44.840 --> 48:51.160]  they're trying to collapse the whole us to have an emergency marshal plan that props up the blue
[48:51.160 --> 48:57.160]  cities and the blue states not the people of the blue cities and blue states trump had the rescue
[48:57.160 --> 49:03.080]  plan thousands of new factories coming back tens of millions of new jobs tax cuts for the middle
[49:03.080 --> 49:11.160]  class and poor people tax incentives for minority owned businesses a massive doubling of federal
[49:11.160 --> 49:17.800]  funding to black colleges the list goes on and on and it's not a conservative package it's a populist
[49:17.800 --> 49:25.240]  emergency boost super liberal old-fashioned just super liberal and by old-fashioned liberal just
[49:25.240 --> 49:29.320]  pumping money to the general public and the stimulus packages and everything else i mean
[49:29.960 --> 49:33.560]  what do you do when your engines stall and you pump more gas into it and i don't even like that
[49:33.560 --> 49:40.280]  type of stuff long-term because it deflates and inflates and causes all sorts of crises but we're
[49:40.280 --> 49:49.160]  already in the crises of our life and we're staring down the barrel of hillary rottem clinton as
[49:49.160 --> 49:53.880]  president and barracus san obama as vice president and i told you they would do it because they're so
[49:53.880 --> 49:58.360]  damn desperate and they knew trump was going to win internal polling had him 15 points ahead of
[49:58.360 --> 50:03.000]  democrats but they know if they crunch everybody and then say don't you want to go back the way it
[50:03.000 --> 50:09.560]  was nostalgia hillary and obama sure things weren't perfect then but at least there wasn't a clamp
[50:09.560 --> 50:15.800]  down and and subconsciously it's working people are starting to blame trump they're starting to
[50:15.800 --> 50:21.000]  turn against the president the president's internal polling shows that because people when
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.920]  they're being strangled start flailing a drowning man or woman if you try to help them will scratch
[50:26.920 --> 50:31.960]  your eyes out and try to climb up on top of you and they are they're climbing up on top of america
[50:31.960 --> 50:37.880]  they're climbing up on top of trump and as it becomes known that we're in a mega massive deep
[50:37.880 --> 50:46.120]  depression already trump can only level with the american people about the plan of the globalist
[50:46.120 --> 50:51.640]  and how they did it and explain how they're going to make it even worse and he has to just
[50:51.640 --> 50:56.840]  level and say it's the chai comms with these criminals they're a fifth column and america is
[50:56.840 --> 51:01.560]  about to end because the globalist will never let us come back up and they're going to bring in total
[51:01.560 --> 51:06.840]  authoritarianism and have martial law anytime they want with viruses and have forced inoculations
[51:06.840 --> 51:14.280]  and medical tyranny and combat robots controlling your life the dystopia is here it's just like in
[51:14.280 --> 51:19.800]  one of the last star wars movies they're super cheesy but it's good when like they're coming up

[57:33.080 --> 57:40.600]  new order from the info war this is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of texas
[57:40.600 --> 57:45.640]  the us resistance against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by communist china
[57:45.640 --> 57:50.760]  allied with the big mega banks that set up communist china in 1949 the communist chinese
[57:50.760 --> 57:54.840]  have taken control of us telecommunications infrastructure the communist chinese have
[57:54.840 --> 57:58.680]  taken control of hollywood the communist chinese have taken control of the main universities this
[57:58.680 --> 58:03.480]  is all confirmed this is not a drill big tech and silicon valley is almost completely run by the
[58:03.480 --> 58:08.920]  communist chinese government they've officially become state run apple 100 google is now making
[58:08.920 --> 58:14.680]  the transition and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship they are now beta testing
[58:14.680 --> 58:19.640]  using me as the straw man a demonized version of alex jones to do that this is happening this is
[58:19.640 --> 58:24.520]  not like the other probes before that we're meant to get you used to probes and censorship thinking
[58:24.520 --> 58:29.960]  you would adapt the censorship by just putting up with it now this attack is thousands and thousands
[58:29.960 --> 58:35.480]  and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks this is a tight traded dose
[58:35.480 --> 58:41.800]  reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation
[58:42.520 --> 58:47.080]  in layman's terms they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed we adapt to
[58:47.080 --> 58:53.320]  being pressed with the low dosages of oppression now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover
[58:53.320 --> 58:59.560]  we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the
[58:59.560 --> 59:05.400]  dose total internet of things integration global social score complete command and control system
[59:05.400 --> 59:11.240]  it is the virtual reality ai weapon system now attacking the united states with traders inside
[59:11.240 --> 59:16.120]  the major security agencies blocking trumps resistance of the program and attempting to stop
[59:16.120 --> 59:21.400]  us from removing the tentacles of the chai con slash big tech begging combine emergency situation
[59:21.400 --> 59:25.480]  i have been chosen for destruction because i brought you this information and have been battering
[59:25.480 --> 59:31.640]  ramming it out as much as i can they want to double use me as they always do in any complex system
[59:31.640 --> 59:37.400]  of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us so they take what i've
[59:37.400 --> 59:42.520]  said being sincere build me into an insincere person in the straw man i'm a person that cares
[59:42.520 --> 59:47.000]  about life and children and is against these wars and so they make me a herder of children
[59:47.000 --> 59:51.720]  and then they build me into this line to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring
[59:51.720 --> 59:57.800]  all of you to make a debate about alex jones so even if i didn't sell out to them they now use me
[59:57.800 --> 1:00:04.440]  as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction i have now been captured by the enemy
[1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:09.640]  in the information warfare fulcrum has been used against you only your full understanding of this
[1:00:09.640 --> 1:00:17.160]  key will break you free from this paradigm i have given you the transmission now break free
[1:00:19.400 --> 1:00:27.000]  i have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:35.560]  mind of man thomas jefferson if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:44.440]  all right let me do this i was watching this last night or this afternoon was live and it was so
[1:00:44.440 --> 1:00:51.480]  good that i thought i really need to air the first 35 minutes of it that would fit nicely
[1:00:51.480 --> 1:00:58.600]  with some extra time in this hour but there's also so much news here to hit and we have alan
[1:00:58.600 --> 1:01:02.840]  keys coming on who sent me over some great notes he's absolutely right about the virus
[1:01:02.840 --> 1:01:09.960]  China and the virus are attacking us with the real enemies fear and some other key points
[1:01:09.960 --> 1:01:14.680]  he'll be on with us i also want to open the phones up and so i'm going to talk to my producer
[1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:18.840]  about scheduling this week and make sure a few of the days we don't have guests i'm the one always
[1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:25.960]  saying a lot i like to have guests on but we do need to we do need to open the phones up as well
[1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:33.400]  and get your take on everything so think about what i want to do here this is one hell of a time
[1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:38.280]  to be alive because we are at war with communist china right now and the democratic party has
[1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:43.640]  literally been converted over into an america hating freedom hating group of morons because
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:48.040]  they're not even to get power if they're successful they're idiots but they're just such spoiled
[1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:52.920]  brats that they get a reflected glory out of evil and they think that burning america down and
[1:01:52.920 --> 1:01:58.600]  mounting on the wall will give them power the authoritarian's across the planet want the power
[1:01:58.600 --> 1:02:03.640]  to be able to tell you to stay in your houses and don't leave and only go where they tell you can go
[1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:08.920]  it's called martial law it's called living in the authoritarian country and everybody knows that
[1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:13.960]  everybody understands that and the democrats have now shown their hands with the deep state
[1:02:13.960 --> 1:02:18.440]  saying we're going to listen to Fauci and the world health organization who've done nothing
[1:02:18.440 --> 1:02:23.000]  but put out all this faked disinformation so far we're not going to listen to the president
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:27.720]  we're not going to listen to congress and then all these other corporations are going to work
[1:02:27.720 --> 1:02:34.120]  in tandem with big tech to surveil and control and keep things shut down this is economic warfare
[1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:39.480]  and i know everybody understands that public with the president and others need to develop a plan
[1:02:39.480 --> 1:02:45.320]  to understand that this is a global corporate civil war and that we're being held hostage
[1:02:45.320 --> 1:02:50.600]  and this is a mutiny against our country by globalist forces only understanding
[1:02:51.400 --> 1:03:01.240]  the reality of the magnitude of that gives us any chance of defeating it
[1:03:01.240 --> 1:03:18.200]  all right we are now into hour number two former u.s. ambassador to the un allen keys
[1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:23.080]  is joining us coming up the next hour i also intend to take some calls when that's going on
[1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:28.440]  he's now mainstream news that fauci is secretly working with the communist chinese
[1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:33.800]  you have the five eyes coming out in all 17 u.s. intelligence agencies saying no trump's right
[1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:38.120]  we're the ones that showed it to him that it did come out of wuhan it is manmade the discoverer
[1:03:38.120 --> 1:03:43.640]  of hiv is scanned it is manmade and it was obama and fauci that paid the chinese to make it when it
[1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:49.720]  was illegal in the united states to do so so it's all coming out the globalists don't know what to do
[1:03:50.520 --> 1:03:56.120]  and they're hoping that by fauci being exposed trump will see fauci as the government and so
[1:03:56.120 --> 1:04:01.240]  trump will you know cover that up no trump needs to level the american people there is a fifth column
[1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:06.760]  of chai com anti americans uh and and just destroy them uh because they're not going to stop their
[1:04:06.760 --> 1:04:10.280]  mischiefs they're not going to stop trying to blow the country up and overthrow the government
[1:04:10.280 --> 1:04:16.600]  and overthrow the election uh until that until that happens and that's really where we are
[1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:21.880]  ladies and gentlemen i'm going to play this clip again though democrat xcia agent says comey must
[1:04:21.880 --> 1:04:27.560]  get the death penalty if found guilty of treason disregard former fbi director james comie should
[1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:32.600]  face the death penalty if found or disgraced uh former fbi director james comie should
[1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:39.080]  face the death penalty if found guilty or weaponizing fbi against donald trump
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:45.400]  and his campaign in 2016 according to xcia agent and democrat brian dean right let's play that
[1:04:45.400 --> 1:04:49.880]  clip what do you think if anything should happen to james comie then what's your opinion on that
[1:04:49.880 --> 1:04:54.200]  my preference i'd love to see the death penalty and boy oh boy i'll tell you if i could flip the
[1:04:54.200 --> 1:05:00.120]  switch myself i'd do it because these men are traitors they absolutely assaulted not just the
[1:05:00.120 --> 1:05:07.160]  trump administration but your vote my vote and anybody who went to the ballot box in 2016 irrespective
[1:05:07.720 --> 1:05:12.760]  of who we voted for they decided that they were going to choose the nation's political winners and
[1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:18.120]  losers and so again what's coming out what the whole world is waking up to that we've been hammering
[1:05:18.120 --> 1:05:26.040]  since late january is the bill millen gates foundation hosted event 201 we covered at the
[1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:30.920]  time of 65 million dead world governments the result the rockefeller foundation report

[1:06:02.360 --> 1:06:06.280]  of course you've already hammered on all of this but this is the stuff trending on twitter right
[1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:14.440]  now they've got a big big big big big problem they've got a big problem so you go ahead and
[1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:20.760]  try to kill the messenger gates anything happens to me we know who did it and we've got plans for
[1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:26.440]  all be released we have the documentaries made we have all the preparations all the information
[1:06:26.440 --> 1:06:33.160]  we've already covered but santa anna thought the destruction of the alamo would make him win the war
[1:06:33.160 --> 1:06:40.120]  it lost him the war so either way we win but that's what these folks are up to billa malinda gates
[1:06:40.120 --> 1:06:46.680]  foundations charter documents that we've shown here on air state that they are the world population
[1:06:46.680 --> 1:06:53.000]  control bureau and again bill gates doesn't run it he's just the head of it bill gates is the is
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:07:00.120]  the front man the figurehead the forge foundation the carney foundation the rockefeller foundation
[1:07:00.120 --> 1:07:06.120]  the ibm foundation of thomas watson all put their money in to a foundation control about bill gates
[1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:11.480]  his mother on the ibm board bill gates his father that ran plant parenthood and then they needed a
[1:07:11.480 --> 1:07:17.080]  young face so that they could spin that money off into a new corporation to get around the antitrust
[1:07:17.080 --> 1:07:23.080]  laws that congress was still enforcing in the 1980s and 90s and so microsoft was created and
[1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:31.160]  and this is all on record i mean i sit there and i tell high level folks this in dc and they're
[1:07:31.160 --> 1:07:35.480]  writing notes on it and they know i don't mess around and they call me back and they go my god
[1:07:35.480 --> 1:07:40.520]  we looked at this we didn't know this that's it's good to have a novice like trump in there who knows
[1:07:40.520 --> 1:07:46.920]  business and knows how to reboost an economy and you know is a patriot but trump hadn't been studying
[1:07:46.920 --> 1:07:54.120]  secret foundation money and eugenics and you know the new world order so you have to understand
[1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:59.560]  that uh there's a real crash course going on right now inside the government so what i'm
[1:07:59.560 --> 1:08:07.320]  going to do is in the next three segments i'm going to play this interview that's at band.videos

[1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:44.680]  dangerous technology rollouts potential mandatory vaccinations and the violation of our basic human
[1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:50.360]  right to freedom of speech david welcome back to london real thank you brian first of all i want
[1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:55.400]  to announce that we are streaming now on our new digital freedom platform which is a censorship free
[1:09:55.400 --> 1:10:00.920]  independent broadcasting system that is of the people by the people for the people and available
[1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:07.400]  exclusively through our website at londonreal.tv can everyone watching please share this link now
[1:10:07.400 --> 1:10:12.520]  via the sidebar to any and all of your social media channels let me read that can everyone
[1:10:12.520 --> 1:10:17.000]  this is a learning experience for everybody and i and i'm this guy's as smart as i am but i
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:21.080]  encouraged him to just double down a month ago and do this and he already had the idea himself
[1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:24.600]  so i thought it was a really great idea great minds think a lot but when you share the links
[1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:29.880]  at man dot video when you share the links at info wars dot com ford slash show or from london real
[1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:35.240]  it changes the world this is how you override ai and the fact that we're routinely getting a million
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:39.160]  views on videos at man dot video is because of you taking action and the fact that this had
[1:10:39.160 --> 1:10:44.680]  over a million viewers that tuned in to their stream that's revolutionary that's you doing that
[1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:49.880]  but it took david i it took brian rose it took info wars it took you out there
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:56.040]  watching and caring and it took those of us that already had media platforms and that already were
[1:10:56.040 --> 1:11:02.680]  popular in the system not backing down everybody else bounds oh just don't have this person on okay
[1:11:04.200 --> 1:11:09.560]  now don't have these people on okay now don't have this whole group on it don't talk about that okay
[1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:17.080]  and the noose is tightening around your neck until suddenly you can't say anything or do anything
[1:11:17.080 --> 1:11:20.840]  and now you're just another puppet and now you're not popular because you're not telling the truth
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:26.680]  i don't know so many really big people like that that behind the scenes know all this information
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:32.760]  but to stay on the big platforms they went along with it well what about building our own
[1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:37.160]  they've sued us attacked us they're trying to arrest me right now they got all sorts of horrible
[1:11:37.160 --> 1:11:42.280]  stuff going on it's okay people had to go through a lot harder stuff than i'm going through to
[1:11:42.280 --> 1:11:46.520]  establish this country and now the stakes are so high king george just wanted to enslave us
[1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:50.920]  the globalists want to kill us so when we come back i'm going to i'm going to finish up with this but

[1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:59.720]  well communist china wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy used by half
[1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:05.720]  and the united states wouldn't sign on to it so guess what happened along came covid 19
[1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:11.400]  and bill gates celebrating saying it's already cut your carbon footprint by half and that means
[1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:16.520]  you're going to be poor now and under his control and of course with the medical tyranny comes the
[1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:23.480]  force inoculations a micro chip that comes with the vaccine and so much more and bill gates admits
[1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:29.880]  that 700 000 people will get sick and die from it so remember folks they're coming to hurt you and
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:34.680]  your family and destroy your basic rights the same left that says to kill babies all day long
[1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:40.120]  women own their bodies now say you don't own your body and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you
[1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:45.080]  if you don't submit you can't buy or sell or leave your home mark the beast oh and guess what
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:49.400]  jeffrey eppstein and all these people hang out together with bill gates and are a bunch of dirty
[1:13:49.400 --> 1:13:54.920]  devil worshipers in your face they hate you and your family i'm always excited about info wars
[1:13:54.920 --> 1:13:58.760]  live products they're amazing they're cutting edge you love them i love them and they find the info
[1:13:58.760 --> 1:14:04.840]  war in the face of the globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new product over a year in
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:13.480]  development that is amazing the only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic
[1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:20.920]  essential oils on top of it and there's another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just
[1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:27.640]  pour out a bunch of thick gross goo goo but it's high quality it aerosolizes it in a really great
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:33.000]  way i like to put it on my hands rub a little my face it's got organic alcohol in it so spray it
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:38.200]  around your eyes but i just love it personally it's something that's a moisturizer as well
[1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:42.200]  so this is a real innovation i don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand
[1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:48.200]  sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out smells great it's so
[1:14:48.200 --> 1:14:59.160]  refreshing this is a big winner you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:16.200]  remember only you taking action only you overriding the ai system only you engaging modern
[1:15:16.200 --> 1:15:20.600]  paul with your activity can override the new world order and i know you will this full video

[1:17:26.600 --> 1:17:32.040]  biggest live stream in the world that day only behind that of the president of the united states

[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:48.760]  in human history 30 minutes later that live stream episode was deleted and banned on youtube
[1:17:48.760 --> 1:17:53.800]  with no explanation and no communication in that episode you spoke of the covet 19
[1:17:53.800 --> 1:17:59.080]  misdiagnosis and the misclassification of deaths further dangerous technology rollouts
[1:17:59.080 --> 1:18:05.240]  the vaccine agenda economic totalitarianism and the weaponizing of fear the next day a bbc
[1:18:05.240 --> 1:18:10.120]  article broke the news and our representatives at youtube accused you of being a covet 19
[1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:15.720]  denier and subsequently deleted and banned an additional 10 of your videos and my personal
[1:18:15.720 --> 1:18:21.800]  vlogs from our youtube channel instagram facebook and dropbox followed suit by deleting and banning
[1:18:21.800 --> 1:18:26.760]  more of our videos and then london real was completely deplatformed from linkedin and vimeo
[1:18:26.760 --> 1:18:32.280]  without explanation but we thought back and continue to host both episodes rose ike 1 and rose
[1:18:32.280 --> 1:18:37.480]  ike 2 on our website to millions and millions of viewers and we still do today while also
[1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:42.840]  suffering very sophisticated malicious attacks on our technology platform next the uk regulator
[1:18:42.840 --> 1:18:48.120]  off-com who is also in charge of issuing 5g licenses in this country censored the broadcast
[1:18:48.120 --> 1:18:52.920]  of rose ike 1 on london live which is a television channel we have provided content to content to
[1:18:52.920 --> 1:19:00.280]  for many years off-com said and i quote it risked causing significant harm to viewers at this point
[1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:05.160]  i had had enough and i believe in the fundamental right to freedom of speech so i decided we could
[1:19:05.160 --> 1:19:10.520]  no longer rely on any third party for broadcasting and 11 days ago we began crowdfunding to create
[1:19:10.520 --> 1:19:15.720]  the digital freedom platform which is now raised over a million dollars worldwide from over 25 000
[1:19:15.720 --> 1:19:20.040]  people fighting for the right to free speech and freedom of the press it's been an incredible vote
[1:19:20.040 --> 1:19:25.080]  of confidence in what we're doing then two days ago on may 1st you were completely deplatformed
[1:19:25.080 --> 1:19:29.400]  from facebook for publishing quote health misinformation that could cause physical
[1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:34.920]  harm unquote you responded by saying the funny thing about fascism is that it's so predictable
[1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:39.240]  yesterday on may 2nd you were completely deplatformed from youtube because quote
[1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:44.120]  youtube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission
[1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:51.400]  of covid 19 as described by the who and nhs your channel had more than 900 000 subscribers at the
[1:19:51.400 --> 1:19:57.560]  time it was removed which brings us to today may 3rd rose ike 3 which is being live streamed now to

[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:17.400]  be honest these past three weeks have been some of the most challenging in my entire life my
[1:20:17.400 --> 1:20:21.960]  reputation has been questioned my business is under threat and my human rights are being taken away
[1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:27.000]  from me every single day but it's also been most empowering time of my life i got millions of people
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:32.200]  from around the world rising up and voicing their support and as a result i've never been so steadfast
[1:20:32.200 --> 1:20:37.480]  in my convictions for the basic fundamental right of freedom speech and freedom of the press
[1:20:37.480 --> 1:20:42.120]  and that's why we are here broadcasting today David i want to thank you for 30 years of tireless
[1:20:42.120 --> 1:20:48.200]  work and for your own conviction to fight on and now i've got one question for you where do we begin
[1:20:49.480 --> 1:20:56.040]  well welcome to my world Brian and um before i say anything i think what you and your team have
[1:20:56.040 --> 1:21:06.280]  done is absolutely um magnificent because the cutting edge as i know from 30 years of trying to be
[1:21:06.280 --> 1:21:13.960]  there is a very a very lonely place and it's it's the point of the arrow so there's not many people
[1:21:13.960 --> 1:21:23.720]  there and um to do that to be there you have to first of all have a constantly open mind to
[1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:32.840]  information but you have to have a backbone that won't vibrate one that says i'm going to stand up
[1:21:32.840 --> 1:21:40.200]  for what i believe to be right and no matter what is thrown at me i will go on standing up for what
[1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:46.840]  i believe to be right because i'm not going to stand here sit here and start going off defending
[1:21:46.840 --> 1:21:51.400]  myself oh don't say that about me how you could say that about me i couldn't care less what you say
[1:21:51.400 --> 1:22:03.480]  about me boom boom boom and let them worry about me and 30 years of my life has been kind of leading
[1:22:03.480 --> 1:22:10.520]  to this moment certainly leading to this time and i said to you um in the last interview
[1:22:12.040 --> 1:22:18.920]  and some people might have thought it was a bit of bravado i said i'm more powerful than them
[1:22:18.920 --> 1:22:32.520]  and they know it and within minutes of the interview ending they were proving me right
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:43.320]  here they are this cult that i will explain that control the mainstream media my god has
[1:22:43.320 --> 1:22:49.240]  that been any more obvious than in the last few weeks they control silicon valley their own
[1:22:49.240 --> 1:23:01.000]  silicon valley they own the corporations they own the banking system and yet one interview
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:15.960]  with one guy and this all-powerful we're in control omnipotent all-powerful force is running around
[1:23:15.960 --> 1:23:23.160]  like someone shouting fire gotta take him off this take him off that take him off this take him
[1:23:23.160 --> 1:23:32.760]  off the other and what are they saying brian they're saying you're more powerful one man than we are
[1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:40.120]  and so we have to stop what you're saying getting to people all right that's absolutely true and you
[1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:43.800]  every listener out there when you take action speak out you're more powerful than these people
[1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:48.760]  because you're pro human you're pro life you're pro future they are pro satan pro death we'll be back
[1:23:48.760 --> 1:23:54.840]  with the interviews stay with us ladies and gentlemen info wars can now offer high-quality
[1:23:54.840 --> 1:24:01.640]  storable food again other manufacturers were sold out eight weeks ago and they told people they had
[1:24:01.640 --> 1:24:09.160]  food most folks never were delivered their food well when our sponsors food began to run short
[1:24:09.160 --> 1:24:14.360]  they just spent its sales till they open more factories and secured more food so if you get
[1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:19.960]  your orders in right now they can take new orders and get it to you quickly they'll probably have to
[1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:26.840]  suspend orders very very soon again because the lockdown of the economy is killing food distribution
[1:24:26.840 --> 1:24:31.720]  farming you name it and now it's mainstream news the food shortages and delivery are already
[1:24:31.720 --> 1:24:37.800]  starting to happen if trump can turn the economy back on and rest control of our system away from
[1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:42.840]  the globalist things may be okay but it looks like it's going to get very very rough so again ladies
[1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:47.320]  gentlemen now is the time to secure the number one thing you need high-quality storable food
[1:24:47.320 --> 1:24:53.000]  ready to get to you and your family now if you get your orders in at four store dot com globalism
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:25:00.200]  is all about making the nation state and the population itself obsolete non-essential that's
[1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:07.320]  why they position it with economic tariffs taxes and controls to our family farms and industry
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:12.440]  that's based in the united states has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate
[1:25:12.440 --> 1:25:19.960]  that's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out they can simply look at
[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:25.720]  us and say because again you are non-essential that's what the robots and all of this is about
[1:25:26.360 --> 1:25:31.400]  it's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives we can be told to stay
[1:25:31.400 --> 1:25:37.000]  on our houses natural shut up this world doesn't belong to people anyways it belongs to the new
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:42.440]  ai gods the rich elitist that emerged with machines yeah that sounds completely insane doesn't it
[1:25:43.160 --> 1:25:49.480]  that's actually the public plan they're pushing these people are completely psychotic and make
[1:25:49.480 --> 1:25:55.160]  hitler look like a choir boy one of our best-selling products is living defense and it's been sold out
[1:25:55.160 --> 1:25:59.720]  for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic we've got a limited
[1:25:59.720 --> 1:26:03.800]  supply right now but it's selling out fast and i want those of you that have it experience living
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:09.160]  defense to get it for yourself here's just part of one testimonial i look in january 2016 i went in
[1:26:09.160 --> 1:26:13.960]  a hospital i went to va hospital out here in boise and i was in until june and one of the only
[1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:19.640]  things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day and i kept here in
[1:26:19.640 --> 1:26:24.040]  doctor group and all you guys talking about living defense let me tell you something man i had an
[1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:29.320]  internal digestive problem and i suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors they
[1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:33.720]  tried every time nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when i kept hearing you and
[1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:37.320]  doctor group and those commercials i said you know what i'm gonna get me some of that freaking
[1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:40.680]  living defense now i wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have
[1:26:40.680 --> 1:26:45.480]  a stuff but i ordered it had it shipped to me i got it i hid it from the nurses i started taking
[1:26:45.480 --> 1:26:51.400]  it man that stuff changed my life it saved my life alex jones and info wars saved my life
[1:26:51.400 --> 1:26:57.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:27:05.800 --> 1:27:08.840]  no i won't back down i'll stand my ground
[1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:23.720]  well i won't back down no i won't back down you can stand me up at the gates of this is the
[1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:29.400]  takeover this is the globalist operation alex jones your host alan keys former ambassador of the
[1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:35.800]  un is on fire concerning what's happening he'll be joining us live on air we'll also take phone
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:42.440]  calls the second half of the interview right now let's go back to the ike rose three which is the
[1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:46.680]  model of victory just like info wars is the model of victory bandot videos the model of victory you
[1:27:46.680 --> 1:27:50.600]  were the model of victory supporting us your word of mouth your support of local radio stations
[1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:57.800]  it's it's king well it's the same thing with they told rose you have him on again we're gonna start
[1:27:57.800 --> 1:28:02.040]  banning and they took abasus grabbers away when he did and then they persecuted him more and then he
[1:28:02.040 --> 1:28:05.720]  went and built his own thing and he collected money and put it into the infrastructure and believe
[1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:11.720]  me it's expensive we pay millions and millions in bandwidth every quarter well that's what he's
[1:28:11.720 --> 1:28:17.000]  doing now imagine a million people on it one time they did it and we can do that too with word of
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:21.080]  mouth that's when you take action so let's go back to the interview you weren't supposed to be able to
[1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:35.640]  hear and you know everything is a frequency my voice now is a frequency and mendacity lies deceit
[1:28:36.760 --> 1:28:46.840]  is a frequency truth is a frequency a much more powerful frequency and they know the power
[1:28:46.840 --> 1:28:56.760]  of the truth circulating because people resonate with it and so if they are going to pull off what
[1:28:56.760 --> 1:29:04.440]  we're unfolding now what we're experiencing now and they are going to control billions of people
[1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:13.400]  they have to control their perception they have to we are in the situation we are now
[1:29:13.400 --> 1:29:25.400]  now because of mass human perception part of that perception is there is a dangerous virus so
[1:29:25.960 --> 1:29:32.360]  I must stay indoors because the authorities are looking after my interests and they've told me
[1:29:32.360 --> 1:29:38.200]  that I have to and if I go out I might catch this a deadly virus and oh my god we're all gonna die
[1:29:38.200 --> 1:29:48.840]  and that perception allows vast numbers of people to concede their uniqueness to concede their
[1:29:49.560 --> 1:29:56.920]  freedom and to sit in their house under house arrest being told what to do by a handful of people
[1:29:56.920 --> 1:30:09.640]  and the other perception is I can see there's something not right here but what are the
[1:30:09.640 --> 1:30:17.480]  consequences of me saying so or taking this on and challenging it and that perception of
[1:30:18.520 --> 1:30:24.520]  what are the consequences for me means that lots of people who have realized something's
[1:30:24.520 --> 1:30:33.560]  not right my god is it not right we'll get into that also sit under house arrest and those two
[1:30:33.560 --> 1:30:44.680]  perceptions they are the reason this is happening because when you break down the number of people
[1:30:44.680 --> 1:30:51.240]  behind this in each country and globally it is tidy I'm good to explain how that's possible
[1:30:51.240 --> 1:30:59.960]  and yet there are getting on for eight billion people there are 66 million people in Britain the
[1:30:59.960 --> 1:31:08.280]  number of people that are locking down Britain are tiny its perception and fear of consequences
[1:31:08.280 --> 1:31:22.200]  that are making this all possible and are destroying the independent livelihoods of
[1:31:22.200 --> 1:31:36.840]  billions of people and the greatest form of control is dependency you need this to survive
[1:31:36.840 --> 1:31:47.160]  and because of this economic Armageddon we have created we are the only way you're going to get it
[1:31:48.040 --> 1:31:55.960]  and you know to get it you do exactly what we say and that's the dynamic that we have shifted
[1:31:55.960 --> 1:32:09.240]  into in a matter of weeks we need to come out of denial and realize that we are now living
[1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:21.080]  in a global version of Nazi Germany no they don't have the jackboots no they don't have
[1:32:21.080 --> 1:32:35.080]  a silly moustache but the structure is the same a tiny few people dictating to everyone else
[1:32:36.600 --> 1:32:45.000]  and we will have a lot of people watching here Brian who will be new to this
[1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:56.200]  and I'm kind of pretty much in a position now to go through a sequence of events
[1:32:57.560 --> 1:33:07.720]  and background manipulation that will explain in very simple terms how a tiny few people
[1:33:07.720 --> 1:33:19.000]  have pulled off a fake pandemic with no virus and convinced vast numbers of people
[1:33:21.240 --> 1:33:29.480]  that there is a virus and they are in danger and giving up their freedom is essential to their
[1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:34.040]  survival and most people have a hard time to even conceive that there might not be a virus
[1:33:34.040 --> 1:33:39.640]  because they see the pictures of New York City they see the pictures of the ICU they see the
[1:33:39.640 --> 1:33:46.280]  numbers on the newspaper they see the president talking about it so most people would say David
[1:33:46.280 --> 1:33:52.200]  there's obviously something happening oh there's something happening and there are people dying
[1:33:52.200 --> 1:34:08.040]  but the the shocking he said what can all be explained and I will today very simple terms
[1:34:08.760 --> 1:34:15.960]  but it's just some quick background for people new to this because there's some background
[1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:25.560]  that is essential to understanding how this was pulled off first of all for much of the last 30
[1:34:25.560 --> 1:34:37.720]  years in my books I have been pointing out that there is a I call it the cult there is a global
[1:34:37.720 --> 1:34:46.680]  network that works through secret societies and literally satanic groups that has a structure
[1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:50.440]  in place which I'm going to describe it's so simple it has to be or it wouldn't work
[1:34:52.280 --> 1:35:05.000]  to dictate from a central point down into even local communities the first thing to get across
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:14.440]  and as I explained this current events are going to become very crystal clear in terms of why they're
[1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:23.480]  happening is where does this cult want to take human society this is not something that's happened
[1:35:23.480 --> 1:35:31.320]  in weeks this goes back a very very long period of time this is why people like older sucks
[1:35:31.320 --> 1:35:37.880]  Lee in brave new world and George Orwell in 1984 were able to predict current events because this
[1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:44.280]  has been in the planning for a very very long time and if you can access that in a
[1:35:45.800 --> 1:35:51.960]  in a sanctum if you like where this plan is being projected from you can predict the future
[1:35:51.960 --> 1:35:55.720]  we come back it starts getting really powerful but they're they're they're set in the table here
[1:35:55.720 --> 1:36:02.520]  the full interviews posted at band.video and at info wars.com see the interview that got David
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:10.440]  I completely banned of all the mainstream platforms like rose three at info wars.com
[1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:18.520]  and at news wars.com at band.video and of course at London real as well but we need to get this
[1:36:18.520 --> 1:36:23.800]  out because he lays it out very smoothly very succinctly he says that there's no virus period
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:27.720]  it's it's manufactured so they can own it but then he explains oh it's all about what's in the
[1:36:27.720 --> 1:36:32.840]  vaccine we know that he gets an ability gates own the supposed virus that's now coming out in the
[1:36:32.840 --> 1:36:37.960]  news that's ready for the vaccine they're just making you beg for it I agree with 99% of what he's
[1:36:37.960 --> 1:36:43.080]  saying other than just you know deny there's any virus at all no they they had to release a
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:47.880]  simulant virus that does kill some people so that they can encounter it with their vaccine but this
[1:36:47.880 --> 1:36:55.080]  is dead on stay with us the superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think even
[1:36:55.080 --> 1:36:59.960]  if it ends up hurting me short term I believe in God and I believe in the long run it'll end up being
[1:36:59.960 --> 1:37:04.360]  better for myself everybody else in this world we live together in I understand what comes around
[1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:08.360]  goes around you read what you saw and I live that and I fundamentally the cellular level
[1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:13.400]  understand it now if I would have hyped up the virus was going to kill three four five million
[1:37:13.400 --> 1:37:18.520]  people like the UN did I was told five times more supplements but you know what I didn't do that
[1:37:19.320 --> 1:37:25.400]  but I said on a routine basis regardless people are vitamin D deficient people are deficient I
[1:37:25.400 --> 1:37:30.840]  had added so many other issues you need those products regardless so we started selling out of
[1:37:30.840 --> 1:37:37.880]  vitamin real fusion all the other products I cut the prices from 30% off to 60% off because I knew
[1:37:37.880 --> 1:37:43.320]  it was the right thing to do during a crisis to make sure people were incentivized to up their
[1:37:43.320 --> 1:37:48.280]  bodies defenses but now I'm telling you with the economic crisis going on get your storeable food
[1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:56.600]  now I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full
[1:37:56.600 --> 1:38:03.880]  wars is that if you're paying attention you know we've done together but I'll tell you this the
[1:38:03.880 --> 1:38:10.280]  technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:17.080]  media they're trying to shudder and silence human resistance so now is the time to understand that
[1:38:17.080 --> 1:38:20.440]  everything we've talked about has been proven accurate and everything you warned your friends
[1:38:20.440 --> 1:38:26.120]  and family about us around to be true so it's now that your credibility is way up the power structures
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:34.200]  are to silence those of us that they can't but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us
[1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:40.760]  we have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech we have to
[1:38:40.760 --> 1:38:46.200]  make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that a long dark night doesn't come so be the
[1:38:46.200 --> 1:38:57.960]  polar bears you are biopqq research that look into it for yourself big brother and the globalists
[1:38:57.960 --> 1:39:04.040]  don't want you to coq 10 oh you probably want to spend some time researching coq 10 and then
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:10.760]  research dna force plus and the types that we have in here the very best forms of the bqq
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:19.000]  and coq and then a whole bunch of other natural ingredients from mother nature that are known
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:26.120]  to supercharge at all this is our best selling overall formula and i've told listeners at the
[1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:31.960]  end of last year that we can't sell products at 50% off anymore because there's not enough markup
[1:39:31.960 --> 1:39:37.080]  in them to fund our operations but because of what's happening and going on in the world right now
[1:39:37.080 --> 1:39:44.360]  now i really want everybody who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of dna force plus
[1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:50.440]  to have dna force plus yourself and your family dna force plus now 50% off
[1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:56.440]  i'm here to tell you i don't need you to thank me and tell me i've done a good job i've done nothing
[1:39:56.440 --> 1:40:03.160]  but my duty i discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum coming after innocent people and i've been
[1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:11.400]  fighting them for 13 years and i'll never stop while i'm growing bread for 26 years alex jones
[1:40:11.400 --> 1:40:18.840]  and info wars have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide waking people up to the new
[1:40:18.840 --> 1:40:28.440]  world order bohemian growth the american deep state the rise of communist china the plan for
[1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:36.920]  global depopulation and global elite pedophiles who pray off of our young the enemy has done their
[1:40:36.920 --> 1:40:45.080]  best to destroy us but because of your support our fight continues join us support the info war
[1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:49.800]  and together we will slay the dragon keep fighting alex you're gladiator
[1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:57.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:41:05.640 --> 1:41:11.160]  remember everything you see and watch here the most powerful corrupt individuals on earth
[1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:15.400]  are battling hard that you not be able to see and whatever else they're trying to keep from you
[1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:22.440]  we bring to the air as well so here's more of us live streaming for ambassador keith joins us
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:29.000]  next hour more of the interview you can see in full at band dot video the full censored
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:37.080]  ike rose three interview um in a sanctum if you like where this plan is being projected from
[1:41:37.080 --> 1:41:45.480]  you can predict the future real simple because um if the plan for the transformation and the
[1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:53.320]  direction of human society is not um challenged if there's not an intervention by people to stop it
[1:41:53.320 --> 1:42:00.440]  then it will happen and so by predicting what the plan is you're predicting the future because the
[1:42:00.440 --> 1:42:07.320]  plan is going to play out uh unless we intervene and it is playing out and and current events are
[1:42:07.320 --> 1:42:15.800]  a massive advancement of it playing out so where do they want to take the world i've been describing
[1:42:15.800 --> 1:42:22.280]  this for a long long time as what i call the hunger game society obviously um named after the
[1:42:22.280 --> 1:42:30.600]  the movie trilogy and the reason i'm i use that phrase is because where they want to take the world
[1:42:30.600 --> 1:42:37.880]  and i will emphasize again this is not me speaking now since the lockdown and the pandemic hoax
[1:42:37.880 --> 1:42:44.360]  this is me speaking decades ago writing decades ago that this was the plan and the hunger game
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:52.520]  society is designed if you think of a pyramid to have a tiny few at the top we call them the one
[1:42:52.520 --> 1:43:03.320]  percent today and at the bottom the rest of humanity basically in dependency in deprivation
[1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:13.800]  in poverty and crucially again the word dependent upon the one percent for the means of survival
[1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:20.200]  and in between the one percent and the rest of the population in this hunger game society
[1:43:20.200 --> 1:43:28.920]  society you have a um in the end what they want it to be is a police military state a fusion of
[1:43:28.920 --> 1:43:36.760]  a fusion of the two but a police military state which um imposes the will of the one percent
[1:43:36.760 --> 1:43:44.440]  upon the rest of the population and stops the population challenging the one percent
[1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:52.840]  now i've been saying over all these years this is where they want to take us and one other level
[1:43:52.840 --> 1:43:59.480]  of this again as i've been saying for a long long time is that this hunger game society would be
[1:43:59.480 --> 1:44:08.840]  controlled by technology so we're talking about a fascist communist global society with an addition
[1:44:09.640 --> 1:44:15.320]  that it is controlled by technology which makes it what people call a technocracy
[1:44:15.320 --> 1:44:23.240]  which is defined as a society not controlled by elected politicians they want all rid of all that
[1:44:23.800 --> 1:44:34.600]  but by technocrats by bureaucrats by scientists by medical bureaucrats and technocrats by engineers
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:46.520]  and scientists etc and we've been moving in that direction very clearly but what do you need more
[1:44:46.520 --> 1:45:01.160]  than anything if you're going to make that society reality you have to destroy the independent livelihood
[1:45:01.160 --> 1:45:08.760]  of vast numbers of the population because while they're running their businesses and employing
[1:45:08.760 --> 1:45:20.040]  people and operating independently making money paying employees you're not going to put humanity
[1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:27.480]  in totality in the bottom reaches of that hunger game society in deprivation in poverty and
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:42.200]  dependency on the few and this fake pandemic which i'm going to explain has been employed
[1:45:43.800 --> 1:45:56.280]  for many reasons but profoundly right in there is to have a lockdown of business particularly
[1:45:56.280 --> 1:46:08.760]  small business which almost in vast numbers will not survive the big people can to have a lockdown
[1:46:08.760 --> 1:46:21.320]  long enough to destroy the independent livelihood of vast numbers of the human population and at
[1:46:21.320 --> 1:46:26.520]  the end of our first interview brian you said to me well where does it go from here and i said
[1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:36.040]  what they're going to do is they're going to keep this going until they reach the point where they
[1:46:36.040 --> 1:46:46.440]  think we've now reached a situation where we've transformed human society we have destroyed
[1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:58.360]  the independent livelihood of enormous numbers of people and it's irreversible and that's what
[1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:05.000]  they're holding on to and what you're going to see is some of it rolled back as little as they can
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:14.200]  get away with and then they're planning new waves of the virus which we're going to get into
[1:47:14.200 --> 1:47:23.000]  and then they will bring lockdown back and the other part of this is they want the whole human
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  population vaccinated and we'll get into that later and the almost indescribable extremes of
[1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:41.800]  psychopath that we have in bill gates so that's where they want to take society okay let me ask
[1:47:41.800 --> 1:47:47.080]  a quick question yeah why would someone who was a member of the one percent who you know take for
[1:47:47.080 --> 1:47:52.200]  example gates like with hundreds of billions of dollars and say the one percent is wealthy
[1:47:52.200 --> 1:47:59.960]  they have real estate they have jets why would they want more well because i think this is a
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:06.680]  this is something we we should get into later because i can explain this but this is not about
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:19.320]  money you see this is about control this is about a complete takeover not just of humans in the in
[1:48:19.320 --> 1:48:27.560]  the physical sense if you like it's to take over their minds and their perceptions directly in the
[1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:35.800]  end through connecting their brains human human brains to a eye which they're already talking
[1:48:35.800 --> 1:48:42.840]  about they're already giving us a time scale of 2030 and this is this all this is going on now
[1:48:42.840 --> 1:48:50.280]  they're all stepping stones to that and why do they want to do that what's what why why well that
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:58.520]  is a a big picture um which would be better i think a little bit later on when i can get into
[1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:04.920]  all that who are these people and why are they doing it because it goes very very deep um and
[1:49:04.920 --> 1:49:11.960]  they are hijacking human society they're hijacking the human race and and later in the chat we we
[1:49:11.960 --> 1:49:19.160]  should get into that because um it's um it's it's apparently far out but less and less far out as
[1:49:20.120 --> 1:49:25.880]  what we thought was far out in terms of this would never happen is now happening but the the
[1:49:25.880 --> 1:49:35.400]  point about um we talked about where they want to go so how do they take us there um and watch the
[1:49:35.400 --> 1:49:41.800]  structure that allows them to pull off something like this global fake pandemic as i would call it
[1:49:45.240 --> 1:49:53.080]  if you think of a transnational corporation the structure is basically the same except that
[1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:59.400]  instead of subsidiaries in different countries it's secret society networks and family bloodline
[1:49:59.400 --> 1:50:07.480]  networks so you have a central point say the headquarters of this cult and it operates in
[1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:18.440]  the shadows um and it's dictating from the center then in each country you have subsidiary networks
[1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:25.640]  of this cult and their job in each country is to control that country's politics
[1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:36.520]  government government administration what we call with um control of the intelligence network
[1:50:36.520 --> 1:50:41.880]  control of the military uh and so on we call the deep state now we even have a word for it i've
[1:50:41.880 --> 1:50:45.800]  been writing about this for decades now now people are actually calling it the deep state
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:53.080]  so you have these networks and they are there to control the politics government administration
[1:50:53.080 --> 1:50:57.880]  let's explain the british empire was taken over by these networks and as it's exposed they don't
[1:50:57.880 --> 1:51:02.120]  know what to do but even Zbigniew Brzezinski in the 70s wrote about the networks but said that they
[1:51:02.120 --> 1:51:06.840]  were a good thing so again the full interviews at the top featured video at bandot video it's
[1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:12.520]  really powerful from here on out COVID-19 he walks through all the evidence shows how they're killing
[1:51:12.520 --> 1:51:19.400]  people shows how they're coding it to give 39 000 per person who they say die from it and all of this
[1:51:19.400 --> 1:51:24.280]  is backed up so we're playing it because they censored david ike we're playing it because they
[1:51:24.280 --> 1:51:29.080]  fear this information we're playing it because it's about 99 percent accurate from my perspective
[1:51:29.080 --> 1:51:33.880]  i'll play about five more minutes of it and then alan keys joins us with a lot of big breaking news
[1:51:33.880 --> 1:51:38.120]  and the latest on the global financial armageddon engineered by the new world order
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:43.880]  how do you put a people under house arrest how do you put them under siege
[1:51:44.520 --> 1:51:48.840]  well you tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up
[1:51:49.400 --> 1:51:54.520]  with the globalist deep state and then had china release to then take down the populist
[1:51:54.520 --> 1:52:00.440]  president and those pesky american people that have become too uppity bill maher even admitted
[1:52:00.440 --> 1:52:05.880]  man i hope we have a depression and now they've tailored the whole thing with the big corporations
[1:52:05.880 --> 1:52:10.840]  and the media are gonna keep the country closed along with the help of the blue cities and blue
[1:52:10.840 --> 1:52:16.840]  states all the time blaming trump and capitalism and americanism for the depression it creates
[1:52:17.480 --> 1:52:22.840]  if america is that stupid we deserve what happens to us but as for me i'm not sitting here and i'm
[1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:27.560]  not taking it it's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the good people keeping
[1:52:27.560 --> 1:52:33.720]  everybody safe but that's not what they're doing they are pulling america up by its roots and irrevocably
[1:52:33.720 --> 1:52:39.560]  damaging our savings our health our whole world and committing millions of third world people to death
[1:52:41.160 --> 1:52:49.320]  look the globalists are satanists all right lord rothschild recently posed at a gallery of art
[1:52:49.320 --> 1:52:55.640]  worshiping the devil and praising lucifer you cannot make this up they flaunt it in our face
[1:52:55.640 --> 1:53:00.040]  that's what environmentalism is it's about having an anti-human future and having people live at a
[1:53:00.040 --> 1:53:05.880]  subsistence feudal surf state that's what they want these people that have stolen the planet are
[1:53:05.880 --> 1:53:11.720]  worth trillions of dollars do not want you having a good life they know you're having fun they know
[1:53:11.720 --> 1:53:16.280]  you have a great wife a great husband great children they hate your guts they are the most
[1:53:16.280 --> 1:53:23.880]  horrible evil people on the planet they openly fund racism war degeneracy pedophilia everything
[1:53:23.880 --> 1:53:28.600]  else imagine the most horrible thing in the universe and then imagine it doubled tripled
[1:53:28.600 --> 1:53:34.360]  quadrupled and being gullible and being domesticated just makes them rise up and attack you harder
[1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:38.040]  and they're the ones that launched this whole attack on the planet and they are the enemy of
[1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:47.160]  humanity and need to be stood up against you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:47.160 --> 1:54:02.360]  and so on we call the deep state now we even have a word for it i've been writing about this for
[1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:07.320]  decades now now people are actually calling it the deep state so you have these networks
[1:54:08.120 --> 1:54:14.840]  and they are there to control the politics government administration major corporations the
[1:54:14.840 --> 1:54:23.560]  banking system and finance and the media ownership of the media to control perception
[1:54:23.560 --> 1:54:32.680]  by controlling information and part of these different pyramidal hierarchies with the cult at
[1:54:32.680 --> 1:54:46.200]  the top include control of the medical systems in each country control of health systems control of
[1:54:47.480 --> 1:54:58.760]  the big pharma big pharmaceutical cartel mainstream medicine arena so this is going on
[1:54:58.760 --> 1:55:07.400]  in every country with the central point i call it the spider dictating just like a transnational
[1:55:07.400 --> 1:55:13.880]  corporation dictates to its subsidiaries and they're all working to the same agenda the same
[1:55:13.880 --> 1:55:22.920]  blueprint and there's two mass mind control mass mind perceptual manipulation techniques
[1:55:22.920 --> 1:55:30.120]  that this cult uses to advance its agenda one i called a long time ago problem reaction solution
[1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:38.120]  where you covertly create a problem you get your unquestioning media have we seen that or not in
[1:55:38.120 --> 1:55:44.360]  the last few weeks to tell the public the version of that problem you want them to believe and you
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:50.520]  want the public to be saying in a state of fear and anxiety or outrage something must be done
[1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:55.240]  what are they going to do about it and then those who've covertly created the problem and got that
[1:55:55.240 --> 1:56:00.680]  reaction then openly offer the solutions to the problems they've covertly created and blame
[1:56:00.680 --> 1:56:07.000]  someone else for and there's another version of that which i have called um no problem reaction
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:14.840]  solution that's where you don't need a real problem you need the perception of one weapons
[1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:22.040]  of mass destruction in iraq there was a no problem reaction solution to justify the invasion with
[1:56:22.040 --> 1:56:30.840]  all its ongoing consequences of iraq there's a no problem reaction solution called human cause
[1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:37.560]  climate change which when you break down the facts as opposed to the propaganda is absolutely
[1:56:37.560 --> 1:56:49.560]  unsupportable and then we come to current events and a colossal of historic unprecedented proportions
[1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:57.480]  no problem reaction solution the global pandemic so with that background
[1:56:57.480 --> 1:57:12.280]  how have they pulled it off well i go back to the fact that each country has its own subsidiary
[1:57:12.280 --> 1:57:20.520]  network of the cult whose job is to impose the will of the cult centrally dictated and therefore
[1:57:20.520 --> 1:57:25.160]  these different subsidiaries can work as one unit when to the public they're different countries
[1:57:25.160 --> 1:57:31.480]  there are borders there are different races and political systems actually at the cult level
[1:57:31.480 --> 1:57:39.720]  there are no borders this is vital to understand something else i've been saying for decades
[1:57:40.760 --> 1:57:52.920]  before this started is the blueprint for the global orwellian fascist society the technocracy
[1:57:52.920 --> 1:58:02.200]  is china i said what they are doing and what they've done obviously in my books for years
[1:58:03.160 --> 1:58:13.240]  they have had a fierce vicious dictatorship in china for a long period this means unlike
[1:58:13.240 --> 1:58:20.760]  in the west where until now no longer they've had to pay lip service to freedom and democracy and
[1:58:20.760 --> 1:58:29.960]  all this stuff in china what we want we're but you do it and so they've been able through simple
[1:58:29.960 --> 1:58:36.120]  imposition to bait and test it all and now they're rolling out their globalist model not the chinese
[1:58:36.120 --> 1:58:39.640]  model the globalist model see the full interviews another two and a half hours of it it's really
[1:58:39.640 --> 1:58:45.560]  powerful at band.video share it from news wars dot com you are the resistance our special guest
[1:58:45.560 --> 1:58:52.520]  joins us in the other side i'm always excited about info wars life products they're amazing
[1:58:52.520 --> 1:58:56.120]  they're cutting edge you love them i love them and they find the info war in the face of the
[1:58:56.120 --> 1:59:03.720]  globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is
[1:59:03.720 --> 1:59:12.200]  amazing the only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it
[1:59:12.200 --> 1:59:19.080]  and there's another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick
[1:59:19.080 --> 1:59:24.920]  gross you goo but it's high quality it aerosolizes it in a really great way i like to put it on my
[1:59:24.920 --> 1:59:30.600]  hands rub a little bit on my face it's got organic alcohol in it so spray it around your eyes but i
[1:59:30.600 --> 1:59:36.440]  just love it personally it's something that's a moisturizer as well so this is a real innovation
[1:59:36.440 --> 1:59:40.600]  i don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[1:59:40.600 --> 1:59:56.520]  essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out smells great it's so refreshing this is a big winner
[2:00:03.880 --> 2:00:08.840]  welcome back i'm alec jones your host and alan tees as usual is on fire
[2:00:08.840 --> 2:00:13.000]  loyal liberty dot com i'm not going to go over his whole background he was a military brat lived
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:18.280]  all over the world and a lot of his family have been you know a great patriot center military
[2:00:18.280 --> 2:00:23.080]  he was appointed by ronald reagan to be the us ambassador to the united nations he's an author
[2:00:23.080 --> 2:00:27.880]  talk show host tv host and he's pro-life pro-liberty but i want to get him on so he has time here
[2:00:27.880 --> 2:00:30.600]  we'll also take some calls for him at the bottom of the hour i'll give the number out
[2:00:31.880 --> 2:00:37.160]  bottom of the hour or start of the next segment but here are the topics he wanted to get into and
[2:00:37.160 --> 2:00:41.640]  that's right when i wanted him on about to talk about china and the virus are attacking us but
[2:00:41.640 --> 2:00:46.840]  the real enemy is fear given the open-ended nature of the coronavirus threat no vaccine can defend
[2:00:46.840 --> 2:00:50.760]  us against the real threat which is the destruction of our god and outright liberty sovereignty the
[2:00:50.760 --> 2:00:55.640]  constitution that preserves this and other points he'll get to so alan great to have you back please
[2:00:55.640 --> 2:01:00.520]  you've got the floor all interrupt give us the state of where we're at right now because i see
[2:01:00.520 --> 2:01:06.200]  a global catastrophe the un admits 135 million beginning to starve millions starving to death
[2:01:06.200 --> 2:01:11.400]  300 000 a day external starving to death i guess bill gates and the eugenicists are getting their
[2:01:11.400 --> 2:01:18.600]  way of the population while we're taught to live under martial law well i i think that the first
[2:01:18.600 --> 2:01:26.520]  thing we have to realize is that this is an assault and it's in a key way an assault on the entire
[2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:31.720]  west as it used to be called countries in north america and in europe and australia and other
[2:01:31.720 --> 2:01:39.320]  countries like this that have been a bulwark against totalitarian tyranny since before the
[2:01:39.320 --> 2:01:46.120]  second world war obviously but especially in the aftermath of that war and and i think that this
[2:01:46.120 --> 2:01:52.920]  is being orchestrated in a way that you know there's this question did the chinese virus come out
[2:01:52.920 --> 2:01:58.920]  of the laboratory well i think now a lot of facts are on the table that suggest the people who are
[2:01:58.920 --> 2:02:03.560]  willing to look at it that that's the most plausible thing that happened but that's not the key
[2:02:03.560 --> 2:02:09.880]  question what were they doing in that laboratory uh and unless you're crazy uh and have no interest
[2:02:09.880 --> 2:02:15.240]  whatsoever in helping to defend this country you have to think through the likelihood that what
[2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:22.040]  they were doing they did on purpose because all the behavior after this whole crisis began and
[2:02:22.040 --> 2:02:26.680]  supposedly in wuhan and the release of the virus there somewhere they were deceitful and doing
[2:02:26.680 --> 2:02:32.280]  everything possible to make sure that the virus would have an opportunity to spread to other
[2:02:32.280 --> 2:02:38.520]  countries and in particular to our country uh did they do that as an afterthought taking advantage
[2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:44.520]  of the crisis as these leftists always say or was it planned as a crisis i happened to tend in the
[2:02:44.520 --> 2:02:49.640]  latter direction and think that this is a planned strategy being directed against us and that sadly
[2:02:49.640 --> 2:02:55.400]  we're playing into their hands but i also think that when we come to our senses we have all of
[2:02:55.400 --> 2:03:02.200]  the things necessary to make head against it we are a people renowned in fact for first of all
[2:03:02.200 --> 2:03:07.880]  our courage and they are counting entirely on our fears and i think they're making a mistake
[2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:13.640]  americans didn't respond to the quarantine and to our leaders asking us to do something for the
[2:03:13.640 --> 2:03:18.680]  quarantine because we're all afraid to die that's what they're hoping i think we responded to it
[2:03:18.680 --> 2:03:25.000]  because we don't believe in doing things that put other people in danger so if you ask us to do
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:29.400]  something that will help to minimize danger to others while we get the situation assessed they
[2:03:29.400 --> 2:03:35.720]  don't mind but once it becomes clear that staying in this situation is going to pose greater harm
[2:03:35.720 --> 2:03:41.240]  to the country than good they want to see us get out of it they don't intend to be patsies for some
[2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:47.080]  strategy to overthrow our sovereignty overthrow our self-government overthrow especially our economy
[2:03:47.080 --> 2:03:53.480]  and in the end even destroy our ability to defend ourselves with our military these are
[2:03:53.480 --> 2:04:00.680]  the implications across the board of this crisis if we continue to act as if we can shut down our
[2:04:00.680 --> 2:04:06.600]  economy and then bankrupt our people's government in other words the government of the united states
[2:04:06.600 --> 2:04:14.520]  as such represents us the people if we go head over heels in debt to a point where we can't repay it
[2:04:15.240 --> 2:04:21.320]  we then destroy the full faith and credibility of our government and put ourselves under the control
[2:04:21.320 --> 2:04:27.800]  of whoever happens to be holding our debt and able to back up that holding because they moved
[2:04:27.800 --> 2:04:32.040]  out of the dollar and done other things to protect themselves that communist china and that's why
[2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:37.480]  trump said communist china among others but it's also a lot of these billionaires including bill
[2:04:37.480 --> 2:04:43.560]  gates and others who have been positioning themselves to be effectively the fifth column that
[2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:49.240]  inherits the power and the control of the u.s. government once the american people have been
[2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:56.920]  removed from the picture so i think we've got this clearly to deal with but i also think as a people
[2:04:56.920 --> 2:05:03.400]  as we come to our senses we have the wherewithal to deal with it and pray god donald trump is in
[2:05:03.400 --> 2:05:09.560]  fact the leader he seems to be who will be on our side in this process but that i think is what
[2:05:09.560 --> 2:05:14.840]  we have to make sure is happening and we have to second that motion with every kind of understanding
[2:05:14.840 --> 2:05:21.800]  analysis facts that we can put at the disposal of the president so that he doesn't have to
[2:05:21.800 --> 2:05:27.960]  feel that he's going to be destroyed politically because he gets out from under the grip of the
[2:05:27.960 --> 2:05:33.320]  fauchi like people who are essentially pushing him in a direction that destroys america and of
[2:05:33.320 --> 2:05:40.280]  course fauchi is heavily involved with the coronavirus research at wuhan that was made illegal
[2:05:40.280 --> 2:05:48.280]  here so he and obama is his mainline news in 2015 2016 moved it there and i've never heard a more
[2:05:48.280 --> 2:05:53.800]  reasoned boil down in just five minutes that you just gave ambassador keys to what's happening and
[2:05:53.800 --> 2:05:58.600]  that's exactly what's unfolded and now the democrats are like sorry the lockdown never stops
[2:05:58.600 --> 2:06:03.480]  going to go on for years and we're going to bankrupt america and and again i know you're
[2:06:03.480 --> 2:06:09.480]  focused on america but when we moved to third world status the third world dies in mass so if
[2:06:09.480 --> 2:06:15.400]  trump comes out and points out that even the un with one hand is hyping this authoritarianism
[2:06:15.400 --> 2:06:19.880]  and the virus and the lockdown and praising china while criticizing us but with the other hand
[2:06:19.880 --> 2:06:24.600]  their food director says 135 million extra are going to starve to death 300 000 a day already
[2:06:24.600 --> 2:06:31.000]  dying i looked the numbers up they're pretty accurate if trump uses that and says man up america
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:35.640]  like balasaro's doing and explains yeah it's terrible folks are dying from this virus but the
[2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:40.920]  media is way hyping this up to kill the economy they're doing this for political power we're
[2:06:40.920 --> 2:06:45.400]  killing the third world millions of them well americans will man up now but but they're showing
[2:06:45.400 --> 2:06:51.000]  us that the deep state wants us to be a permanent emergency well they certainly are i mean and it's
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:56.920]  not going to be a permanent emergency it's going to become a permanent totalitarian state in which
[2:06:56.920 --> 2:07:04.280]  we no longer have much say in our government because it's been taken over by the bureaucrats the
[2:07:04.280 --> 2:07:10.280]  politicians who are part of this adventure who will no longer by the way really be elected in any
[2:07:10.280 --> 2:07:15.960]  fashion that we control and it's going to be controlled by those who control the financial
[2:07:15.960 --> 2:07:20.520]  resources because we will have destroyed our full faith and credibility so that the u.s.
[2:07:20.520 --> 2:07:25.560]  government can't borrow money and will therefore be at the mercy of the folks so this is the
[2:07:25.560 --> 2:07:30.840]  greatest threat that's our founding and and global tyranny is now descending upon the planet
[2:07:30.840 --> 2:07:35.560]  with the stated goal of billa malinda gates and all of them of global depopulation how do we
[2:07:35.560 --> 2:07:39.640]  trust the person that says he wants to get rid of everybody and there are too many people
[2:07:39.640 --> 2:07:45.080]  to now give us an inoculation well i'm not sure we as yet are in a position where we really have
[2:07:45.080 --> 2:07:50.120]  to talk about him that much because he hasn't defeated us yet we're not out of this picture we
[2:07:50.120 --> 2:07:55.960]  haven't been battered down to nothing or anything like that what we do in the course of the next
[2:07:55.960 --> 2:08:02.040]  month or two is going to determine however what kind of a future we have and i think people are
[2:08:02.040 --> 2:08:07.720]  already indicating look we cooperated with us we have the goodwill to do that we have the self
[2:08:07.720 --> 2:08:13.960]  discipline to do that but they're now reminding our leaders that we also have the guts and
[2:08:13.960 --> 2:08:20.760]  intelligence to recognize when something's being put over on us that will destroy us as a free
[2:08:20.760 --> 2:08:27.720]  nation destroy us as a decent self-governing people and put us under the yoke of the kind of
[2:08:27.720 --> 2:08:34.680]  totalitarian tyranny that abandons conscience and destroys humanity itself by the many tens of
[2:08:34.680 --> 2:08:39.960]  millions we won't have it and i think it's time we remembered that and started to look for the
[2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:47.400]  specific things we must now do in order to make sure that we put in motion all the things that
[2:08:47.400 --> 2:08:53.320]  are needed for us to get past this imposed crisis so that it doesn't produce the result those who
[2:08:53.320 --> 2:08:59.400]  have imposed it on us expect well ambassador ellen keys we've got to take the interview today
[2:08:59.400 --> 2:09:03.480]  and boil it down to 10 minutes that first five and and you talk about solutions when we come back
[2:09:03.480 --> 2:09:06.840]  and i'm going to personally try to make sure that we send it to everybody our listeners
[2:09:06.840 --> 2:09:10.920]  send everybody and that somehow president trump gets it because you're absolutely right when you
[2:09:10.920 --> 2:09:15.720]  say a month maybe two months and then things are going to be basically irreversible unless we go to
[2:09:15.720 --> 2:09:20.520]  war and if we leave the very deep state in that's helping orchestrate all this i don't see any hope
[2:09:20.520 --> 2:09:25.560]  we better warn everybody now that there's not much more time to turn around let's talk about
[2:09:25.560 --> 2:09:28.680]  how bad it's going to get if we don't turn it around but then let's talk about solutions
[2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:35.720]  when we come back with former ambassador united nations allen keys and his websites are excellent
[2:09:35.720 --> 2:09:41.160]  loyal to liberty.com and imtv.us we'll be right back please stay with us i'm alex jones please tell
[2:09:41.160 --> 2:09:45.880]  everyone you know however you're listening or watching to tune in now this is beyond critical i
[2:09:45.880 --> 2:09:53.000]  bless you the official numbers are now in the united states is in the biggest financial collapse
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:58.760]  in our history this is the worst employment collapse in us history by a very wide margin
[2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:03.720]  writes michael snider the economic collapse block at this point we should no longer speak of
[2:10:03.720 --> 2:10:10.040]  economic collapse as something that will happen in the future it is now here and he does an excellent
[2:10:10.040 --> 2:10:15.400]  job in the article in four words dot com of laying it out this was done by design
[2:10:16.040 --> 2:10:22.520]  trump fought to open the economy but the hijacked blue cities and states with the tricoms and with
[2:10:22.520 --> 2:10:28.760]  hollywood and the media held america underwater until we sucked it into our lungs and now we're
[2:10:28.760 --> 2:10:34.680]  lying there like a fish dying there's not much time to get the water out of our lungs so remember
[2:10:34.680 --> 2:10:40.120]  for decades to come when millions starve to death worldwide and you live in slums with no medicine
[2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:46.520]  the globalist did this the globalist did this the globalist did this the globalist did this
[2:10:47.480 --> 2:10:53.720]  hiding in plain view politico the associated press you name it admit that a half a billion people
[2:10:53.720 --> 2:10:59.800]  extra 500 million are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions
[2:10:59.800 --> 2:11:05.240]  already starving because the global lockdown that is hundreds of times worse than all the death of
[2:11:05.240 --> 2:11:10.360]  the world caused by covet 19 and the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the chai comms
[2:11:10.360 --> 2:11:15.640]  at the world health organization with bill gates involved are now the ones running the operation
[2:11:15.640 --> 2:11:20.360]  to shut down society created depression and forcibly inoculate everybody this is insane
[2:11:20.360 --> 2:11:25.080]  ladies and gentlemen if they succeed it's over you need to get prepared now you need to get high

[2:13:15.240 --> 2:13:19.400]  all right going back to former ambassador united nations a point about ronald reagan
[2:13:19.400 --> 2:13:23.480]  alan tees a real patriot never see this guy on tv anymore hear about him a lot you know he's been
[2:13:23.480 --> 2:13:27.480]  everywhere he because they they've banned him they've they've tried to censor him he gets out on
[2:13:27.480 --> 2:13:32.600]  talk radio and has his own tv system and still reaches a lot of people but this guy is amazing
[2:13:32.600 --> 2:13:37.080]  i've been watching him since i was in high school hell junior high i guess 11 you know what he said
[2:13:37.080 --> 2:13:41.480]  i always liked when he came on tv uh but but he's here well this is your shorter segment long
[2:13:41.480 --> 2:13:45.880]  segment coming up uh you you can go where you want to go but you just laid out beautifully
[2:13:45.880 --> 2:13:50.920]  how they set us up the authoritarian power grab uh you want to get into how bad it's going to get
[2:13:50.920 --> 2:13:57.400]  if we don't turn around or what we should do to turn this around right now well i think we can
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:02.840]  summarize how bad it's going to get with one word we're all focused on the death of individuals
[2:14:02.840 --> 2:14:09.560]  right how many people individual people are dying because of the threat of the virus the whole nation
[2:14:09.560 --> 2:14:17.720]  and our whole way of life dies if the actual attack which is against our institutions our character
[2:14:17.720 --> 2:14:26.360]  our rights and everything that makes us a free people and a nation it all it's all gone so the
[2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:33.800]  threat is the overthrow of our way of life it disappears so we have a choice once you see
[2:14:33.800 --> 2:14:39.960]  that that choice is the same as the choice that would have faced you if you were say you're you
[2:14:39.960 --> 2:14:48.600]  were a young person back in 1940 1941 after the japanese attack pearl harbor right is your first
[2:14:48.600 --> 2:14:53.800]  thought the japanese are threatening me let me get a shelter in place let me find a place to hide
[2:14:53.800 --> 2:15:01.640]  right how many of you felt that way after uh the 9 11 attacks see i know a lot of folks and you
[2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:08.680]  know the first impulse was you want to get out there and fight so once you begin to realize that
[2:15:08.680 --> 2:15:16.600]  we are being subject to an attack that intends to overthrow our way of life and that they are using
[2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:24.040]  the virus to basically do what the threat of bullets and nuclear war and so forth and so on
[2:15:24.040 --> 2:15:31.240]  is supposed to do make you so afraid that you simply surrender that's what they want are we that
[2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:38.040]  people so afraid that we'll just surrender always keeping in mind that we would have been defeated
[2:15:38.040 --> 2:15:43.720]  in every war we ever fought if americans had looked at battlefields and said oh that's a dangerous
[2:15:43.720 --> 2:15:49.640]  place i'll get killed on that battlefield i'm not going don't include me and not count me out
[2:15:50.360 --> 2:15:57.080]  are we really that way now because the battlefield now the home front now is right here at home
[2:15:57.960 --> 2:16:06.280]  and it's a direct subtle very well thought out attack on the institutions but also the character
[2:16:06.280 --> 2:16:13.160]  term that we need to maintain as a people one example uh the constitution guarantees that we
[2:16:13.160 --> 2:16:17.560]  have the uh the right of the people to assemble right we can make freely assemble they're not
[2:16:17.560 --> 2:16:23.000]  supposed to interfere with that they're interfering with it all over the place does our politics
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:28.680]  really work if we don't get to assemble and talk to each other if we don't get to have the gatherings
[2:16:28.680 --> 2:16:34.360]  where people can speak to us about what they offer what they think what they are understanding is
[2:16:34.360 --> 2:16:39.400]  so we can make rational clear common sense judgments about who really represents us and
[2:16:39.400 --> 2:16:44.600]  our best interest does it work if we can't gather in our churches in our schools in our homes
[2:16:44.600 --> 2:16:49.560]  and talk about what we think is best for our neighborhood for our community for a country of
[2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:55.320]  course not you introduce a permanent way of life that has to stand and six feet apart and you
[2:16:55.320 --> 2:17:01.480]  introduce us into a way of life that's going to put us six feet under the ground as a nation
[2:17:01.480 --> 2:17:06.760]  and as individuals if we dare to stand for our rights uh so we have to look at that and say
[2:17:06.760 --> 2:17:12.520]  well wait a battlefield is here and we have to communicate it clearly right now you know what
[2:17:12.520 --> 2:17:17.960]  our form of battle is right now getting back to work and we need to make it very clear to the
[2:17:17.960 --> 2:17:23.800]  president and everybody else who is supposed to listen to us in the congress and everywhere else
[2:17:23.800 --> 2:17:32.120]  that we want to get back to work because that's the only way our way of life survives and we have
[2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:38.040]  the courage to stand on this battlefield and fight for it and getting back to work will be our way
[2:17:38.040 --> 2:17:43.960]  of fighting for it and that will do it despite the danger right they're not going to make us
[2:17:43.960 --> 2:17:50.840]  afraid anymore uh and leave aside leave aside i i think alex the fact that the little period in
[2:17:50.840 --> 2:17:56.360]  which we've been able to take stock of things my main conclusion from that period is that even
[2:17:56.360 --> 2:18:04.040]  though the threat of the covid 19 virus may be real if you just let it go unchallenged the overall
[2:18:04.040 --> 2:18:12.040]  threat that is faced has been an engineered result just like the virus itself may have been engineered
[2:18:12.040 --> 2:18:18.600]  in a laboratory by the chinese uh in order to serve purposes that they share with people who
[2:18:18.600 --> 2:18:23.800]  include what used to be called fifth columnists i hope people remember where that phrase comes from
[2:18:23.800 --> 2:18:28.840]  it was because during the spanish war i think uh you had one side was being attacked by the other
[2:18:28.840 --> 2:18:34.040]  side and there were people working for the other side inside the city that was under siege and
[2:18:34.040 --> 2:18:40.440]  that was referred to as the enemy's fifth column well absolutely right uh alan sorry i had my uh
[2:18:40.440 --> 2:18:45.400]  mic open was actually talking over you saying hey guys pull up the definition of fifth column
[2:18:45.400 --> 2:18:50.120]  but i happened to have event 201 billa malinda gates with the un and jota rompkins just last
[2:18:50.120 --> 2:18:55.880]  october and the disease x in the un and the whole thing pre-rigged uh the rockefeller
[2:18:55.880 --> 2:19:01.480]  foundation saying they'll use the disease uh in the in the document lockstep to have a planetary
[2:19:01.480 --> 2:19:06.120]  takeover and billa malinda gates tested what a coronavirus release would do to bring in world
[2:19:06.120 --> 2:19:11.000]  government and hillary clinton will play it next segment said use the virus for their global
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:16.280]  government aims uh the new secretary general of the un said they'll use it for global government
[2:19:16.280 --> 2:19:22.120]  and quote deindustrialization of the west i mean they are openly saying all of this right now it
[2:19:22.120 --> 2:19:30.200]  is insane well i think it's got to be a form of hubris that is excessive pride and arrogance
[2:19:30.200 --> 2:19:36.760]  assuming that you have already won the victory and they assume that i think because um despite
[2:19:36.760 --> 2:19:42.120]  the fact that most of the people who have this happened they've all forgotten that there used
[2:19:42.120 --> 2:19:47.800]  to be a most famous president fdr famous for saying the only thing you have to fear is fear
[2:19:47.800 --> 2:19:53.720]  itself he predicated that statement on the belief that once you made that clear to americans they
[2:19:53.720 --> 2:19:58.680]  were gonna brush you aside because our whole country was built on the basis of risk yeah well
[2:19:58.680 --> 2:20:04.120]  he said time to man up he said time to man up it's time to kick ass it's like hell yeah we're
[2:20:04.120 --> 2:20:08.120]  gonna do it that's all we need to hear is let's be tough and let's not be a but no instead of
[2:20:08.120 --> 2:20:13.160]  we're worshiping whimpering and fear and hyping everything up that's why ball of sorrows right
[2:20:13.160 --> 2:20:18.120]  he said true this is a bunch of fear mongering and they've only got 7 000 people dead if you even
[2:20:18.120 --> 2:20:24.840]  believe that well i think we have to start looking first of all at the specifics of our real situation
[2:20:24.840 --> 2:20:30.600]  we took stock and it's not nearly what they're claiming though they are preparing us for a false
[2:20:30.600 --> 2:20:35.000]  rise in deaths when they get closer to the election everybody should wait for that one
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:39.320]  because i stay there exactly because they're attributing people that die of anything as that
[2:20:39.320 --> 2:20:42.680]  twice all the blue states have all the deaths because these are criminals that run them we'll
[2:20:42.680 --> 2:20:53.480]  drive back allergies dander asthma germs toxins there are many reasons why we need to think about

[2:22:45.080 --> 2:22:48.600]  Ten weeks ago, I began to tell listeners that they needed to get high-quality
[2:22:48.600 --> 2:22:52.720]  storeable food. Not because of the virus, but because of the crises and the
[2:22:52.720 --> 2:22:56.840]  economic shutdown, it would cause, because the globalists were planning to
[2:22:56.840 --> 2:23:00.720]  hold America hostage and run a blockade through the blue cities and blue
[2:23:00.720 --> 2:23:05.480]  states. Now that prediction has come true, because the globalists are running an
[2:23:05.480 --> 2:23:12.160]  operation. It's not predictions. We have their battle plans. So, going back more
[2:23:12.160 --> 2:23:14.880]  than eight weeks ago, all major storeable food companies were sold out,
[2:23:14.880 --> 2:23:18.880]  except my Patreon supply, because they're the biggest and more pre-positioned. When
[2:23:18.880 --> 2:23:22.720]  it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in, that they wouldn't be
[2:23:22.720 --> 2:23:26.040]  able to fulfill them in a timely manner. They stopped taking orders till they got
[2:23:26.040 --> 2:23:29.080]  caught back up. Well, now they're caught back up. They've got high-quality
[2:23:29.080 --> 2:23:32.880]  storeable food in stock, ready to be packaged and shipped to you. Get your

[2:23:47.880 --> 2:23:53.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:53.280 --> 2:24:15.040]  You're listening to an infowar.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones.
[2:24:15.040 --> 2:24:18.880]  We're having a lot of internet outages the last few months because so many people are
[2:24:18.880 --> 2:24:23.400]  inside doing nothing but watching TV while we collapse the third world status.
[2:24:23.400 --> 2:24:27.400]  Again, the third world is dying in mass. That's why I did that 10-minute rant
[2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:32.760]  about Jonathan Swift and the modest proposal about saying we're just let
[2:24:32.760 --> 2:24:35.980]  the Irish starve to death with our taxes and regulations. How about we just tell
[2:24:35.980 --> 2:24:40.400]  them to breed their babies up to age one and then sell them to gentlemen and
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:45.320]  ladies for dinner, little and recipes how to butcher them and eat them. And I
[2:24:45.320 --> 2:24:48.220]  explained all that and they did my rant. So fine, I'm not gonna kill babies. I'll
[2:24:48.220 --> 2:24:51.880]  eat my neighbors. Well, Governor Northam saying keep babies alive, sell their
[2:24:51.880 --> 2:24:56.360]  organs, keep them comfortable. That's okay because he's killing babies for real.
[2:24:56.360 --> 2:25:00.360]  I just say I'll eat my neighbors. They know it's satire. The media decides to
[2:25:00.360 --> 2:25:04.720]  not act like it's satire. Edit it down to a minute out of a 10-minute rant and
[2:25:04.720 --> 2:25:09.800]  say that I'm saying kill my neighbors. But it's the very same left that revels in
[2:25:09.800 --> 2:25:13.680]  abortion and now openly says they love to kill their babies as an act of power
[2:25:13.680 --> 2:25:17.440]  and an act of rebellion against God. That's all over the news. Oh, but suddenly
[2:25:17.440 --> 2:25:24.760]  I'm this brutal person that wants to do all this and even days after I exposed
[2:25:24.760 --> 2:25:31.240]  all this, I haven't gotten to it yet. We'll do it after our guest leaves us. John
[2:25:31.240 --> 2:25:35.640]  Oliver went on HBO Sunday. Two days after it was clear it was satire. All over
[2:25:35.640 --> 2:25:40.160]  the news it was satire. He played edited clips and said that I literally want to
[2:25:40.160 --> 2:25:45.840]  kill my neighbors. But that I should sell the Rolex watch that my dad gave me
[2:25:45.840 --> 2:25:49.720]  years ago. Well, actually somebody stole the green Rolex. My dad gave me like 10
[2:25:49.720 --> 2:25:52.920]  years ago and I went and bought another one and he I guess he's right. It was
[2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:57.000]  $8,000. That's like 15 now. But the point is I should sell this before I kill my
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:01.640]  neighbors. You see, that's this whole idea that I was serious. These
[2:26:01.640 --> 2:26:07.160]  are very, very, very deceptive people and people know they're deceiving and so
[2:26:07.160 --> 2:26:10.560]  their audiences are getting smaller and smaller. So their answer is censorship.
[2:26:10.560 --> 2:26:15.280]  And now they actually said they want us physically shut down LMTs. How do you
[2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:19.640]  expect this fight to unfold as they try to keep America closed? Because I see
[2:26:19.640 --> 2:26:25.120]  them using the businesses and everybody to basically keep demanding the mask,
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:29.960]  keep demanding the symbol of slavery, keep the fear going so the depression
[2:26:29.960 --> 2:26:33.840]  worsens, even though those businesses themselves are destroying themselves by
[2:26:33.840 --> 2:26:34.760]  their virtue signal.
[2:26:35.880 --> 2:26:40.080]  See, I think they're actually doing what is I understand it can sometimes
[2:26:40.080 --> 2:26:46.200]  happen with a virus. A virus gets into your system and because it takes time
[2:26:46.200 --> 2:26:51.520]  before the body develops a specific antibody for that virus, right? The
[2:26:51.520 --> 2:26:56.640]  virus gets into the cells. In this case, it might be the cells of the lung and
[2:26:56.640 --> 2:27:04.760]  the body gets the signal from the cell that there's a nasty foreign thing
[2:27:04.760 --> 2:27:10.600]  going on in there and it starts to react. And if it doesn't have a specific
[2:27:10.600 --> 2:27:15.520]  antibody, it will release a microphage, an antibody that just kills the cells,
[2:27:15.520 --> 2:27:25.000]  right? And so it comes in and it starts killing off the infected cells. But if
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:30.480]  you don't find that way of dealing with the infection fast enough to get a
[2:27:30.480 --> 2:27:35.520]  specifically designed antibody, what happens? It's going to kill more and
[2:27:35.520 --> 2:27:41.040]  more of the cells and you're going to die because you don't find the so-called
[2:27:41.040 --> 2:27:46.480]  vaccine fast enough to overcome the damage that's being done to your lung
[2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:51.600]  or to your liver, to whatever part of the body, the virus targets. And what
[2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:56.040]  they're fooling us with is the notion the panacea is the vaccine. How can the
[2:27:56.040 --> 2:28:00.800]  panacea be the vaccine if? And here's an assumption that I think we need to start
[2:28:00.800 --> 2:28:05.040]  thinking through at a strategic level. We're arguing over whether it was
[2:28:05.040 --> 2:28:10.200]  engineered. We know in the real world that it might have been. Let's assume for
[2:28:10.200 --> 2:28:13.520]  a moment, like good strategists have to when they're trying to save their
[2:28:13.520 --> 2:28:18.880]  country, that the enemy has the ability to engineer vaccines and they've
[2:28:18.880 --> 2:28:23.400]  engineered a vaccine that was built on one that targets the lung tissue. You do
[2:28:23.400 --> 2:28:27.840]  realize, don't you, that the body has all different kinds of tissues and that you
[2:28:27.840 --> 2:28:32.880]  could, in fact, design a vaccine that would target other parts of the body.
[2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:37.080]  And then you'd have to wait for another vaccine to deal with that problem and
[2:28:37.080 --> 2:28:41.600]  another vaccine to deal with the next problem. You get my drift, right? We're
[2:28:41.600 --> 2:28:45.520]  being walked into a permanent, permanent medical dictatorship and that's why the
[2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:50.120]  carmel sin now is to say, if you have enough zinc, these viruses can't even
[2:28:50.120 --> 2:28:54.440]  get in and replicate. If medical doctors are giving people IV vitamin C, they're
[2:28:54.440 --> 2:28:57.880]  being arrested even though it's legal. If you told people about vitamin D3, they
[2:28:57.880 --> 2:29:00.400]  said they're gonna arrest you. If you told people about topical silver, they
[2:29:00.400 --> 2:29:04.000]  said they're gonna arrest you. There's no hope only Bill Gates and this
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:08.320]  vaccine he's got coming for you. You know what it reminds me of? I was
[2:29:08.320 --> 2:29:11.600]  thinking about this over the last little while. Do you know all this hand
[2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:16.040]  washing that we're doing? Where did that come from? It came from a guy named
[2:29:16.040 --> 2:29:21.880]  Ignat Semmelweis, who introduced it first in his hospital back in 1847 and was
[2:29:21.880 --> 2:29:26.480]  immediately attacked by the medical establishment. He was eventually putting
[2:29:26.480 --> 2:29:30.800]  an insane asylum on false pretenses apparently and he ended up being
[2:29:30.800 --> 2:29:36.320]  brutally beaten to death, right? Because they didn't want this to get out. They
[2:29:36.320 --> 2:29:43.520]  had a stake in their money, hospitals, prestige, high positions in the world and
[2:29:43.520 --> 2:29:48.240]  respect and all of this and they weren't willing to give in to the truth. So they
[2:29:48.240 --> 2:29:52.320]  didn't want to look at the facts and they're pretending that that's science.
[2:29:52.320 --> 2:29:56.800]  Now this guy Semmelweis, he didn't know why hand washing helped because they
[2:29:56.800 --> 2:30:01.720]  hadn't gotten to the whole germ theory thing yet. He just knew that when he
[2:30:01.720 --> 2:30:04.520]  washed his hands the patient survived and when you didn't wash your hands the
[2:30:04.520 --> 2:30:11.040]  patient died, right? Why are they so dead set against us taking that simple first
[2:30:11.040 --> 2:30:16.640]  step of all scientific things and take a look at the world and see what makes
[2:30:16.640 --> 2:30:23.080]  people better. What is an effect? I mean hydroxychloroquine is known and Bill
[2:30:23.080 --> 2:30:26.240]  and Malina Gates funded it so Africa doesn't get it and they've lost a half
[2:30:26.240 --> 2:30:29.520]  billion people to malaria and now Madagascar doctors and the government
[2:30:29.520 --> 2:30:33.000]  certified the same stuff the British discovered with the Dutch 400 years ago
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:37.320]  to stop malaria. They're putting it out as a drink to the public and the UN's
[2:30:37.320 --> 2:30:41.480]  trying to block it saying no Africans and Madagascarans you don't get this and
[2:30:41.480 --> 2:30:46.360]  it's a known thing. Well see what they're keeping us from doing though is
[2:30:46.360 --> 2:30:52.120]  looking at the provisions of nature using our faculty of observation to make
[2:30:52.120 --> 2:30:56.680]  connections and then moving ahead in ways that they themselves are now
[2:30:56.680 --> 2:31:02.480]  acknowledged to be safe. My favorite example is chlorine dioxide, popularly
[2:31:02.480 --> 2:31:07.360]  reviled as bleach, right? They want people to drink bleach. That's a lie from
[2:31:07.360 --> 2:31:14.680]  hell. Chlorine dioxide is well known to the FDA as being something that you can
[2:31:14.680 --> 2:31:19.880]  drink so long as it's within certain safe limits like most things that are
[2:31:19.880 --> 2:31:23.720]  devised for your health. Overdo it, do it in the wrong dosage, do it in the wrong
[2:31:23.720 --> 2:31:27.960]  way. We all take that risk all the time with most of the things that we take to
[2:31:27.960 --> 2:31:32.520]  sustain our health. In this particular case however they have actually approved
[2:31:32.520 --> 2:31:37.680]  it for use to disinfect water. Remember the president's famous question Alex?
[2:31:37.680 --> 2:31:41.560]  Could it, would it be possible that we could find something that would
[2:31:41.560 --> 2:31:46.360]  disinfect meaning kill the virus, remove the virus that would work inside the
[2:31:46.360 --> 2:31:49.680]  body and they acted like whoa that's outrageous that's something we shouldn't
[2:31:49.680 --> 2:31:55.280]  even look at. Well it's been happening. Well we're going to go to break here in a moment.
[2:31:55.280 --> 2:32:00.600]  They even blocked, Sheeter Sinai had a video out about when they were
[2:32:00.600 --> 2:32:05.600]  intubating people with non-UV light and how it was killing the virus and
[2:32:05.600 --> 2:32:10.800]  successful. YouTube took that down and then we saw, then we saw those doctors,
[2:32:10.800 --> 2:32:14.560]  medical doctors came out and they took them down when they talked about hope.
[2:32:14.560 --> 2:32:21.800]  Doesn't that tell you that their aim is not to deal with the death but to evoke
[2:32:21.800 --> 2:32:27.040]  the fear so that they can exploit it because the first thing you do if you
[2:32:27.040 --> 2:32:32.000]  want to deal with the situation rationally is you find a way to stop
[2:32:32.000 --> 2:32:37.080]  people from dying because of what the virus is doing. Step number one, step
[2:32:37.080 --> 2:32:42.040]  number two, you look for a way that is not just going to stop this virus and
[2:32:42.040 --> 2:32:46.600]  that virus but stops a whole range of viruses. They don't want any innovation
[2:32:46.600 --> 2:32:50.880]  and they don't even want, why is it called genotonic? Because the tonic
[2:32:50.880 --> 2:32:55.000]  water contains quinine, which the British military confirmed, blocks malaria and
[2:32:55.000 --> 2:32:59.160]  I'm not selling this, I'm not, they'll go, Jones has a malaria drug, arrest him.
[2:32:59.160 --> 2:33:03.000]  This is how bullying they've gotten where medical doctors have gone on air and
[2:33:03.000 --> 2:33:06.520]  said, yeah, give my patients this, it's working and they threaten to arrest them.
[2:33:06.520 --> 2:33:10.640]  Well, see but there is one person in this country who could actually cut
[2:33:10.640 --> 2:33:14.520]  through these lies. President Trump. That's President Trump. Do you remember
[2:33:14.520 --> 2:33:18.640]  Thomas Jefferson, the Louisiana Purchase and the famous Lewis and Clark
[2:33:18.640 --> 2:33:24.160]  Expedition? Yes. Was that authorized by Congress or by law? No. No, because the
[2:33:24.160 --> 2:33:29.600]  president can take initiatives that fall under the rubric of providing

[2:34:44.640 --> 2:34:49.840]  It doesn't matter how hard I want to fight. If others human beings don't resonate
[2:34:49.840 --> 2:34:52.560]  with what I'm saying, if you don't spread the word, if you don't
[2:34:52.560 --> 2:34:56.480]  buy the products to fund our operation, the dog doesn't hunt. But you get that.
[2:34:56.480 --> 2:35:00.720]  You are patriots. You are people that live and work in the real world of a
[2:35:00.720 --> 2:35:03.600]  race color and create and understand what's happening. And that's why when you
[2:35:03.600 --> 2:35:07.760]  call in and thank me for what I've done, it's really a sick joke. Thank you for
[2:35:07.760 --> 2:35:10.720]  what you've done. We're all of this together. We believe in the rights of the
[2:35:10.720 --> 2:35:13.920]  unborn. We believe in families. We believe in the right to self-defense.
[2:35:13.920 --> 2:35:17.440]  We believe in capitalism. America and Jesus Christ is number one.
[2:35:17.440 --> 2:35:22.080]  And we believe in free speech. And so the fact that you shopped with us
[2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:24.800]  and the fact that you spread the word about what we're doing
[2:35:24.800 --> 2:35:28.480]  does everything in the world. That's why I salute you and I thank you
[2:35:28.480 --> 2:35:31.520]  continually because the globalists thought they'd have this whole
[2:35:31.520 --> 2:35:34.160]  planet sewn up by now. They thought they'd be in charge.
[2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:38.320]  They thought that would have won. But they didn't count on you and I and others
[2:35:38.320 --> 2:35:42.320]  coming together. So God bless you all.
[2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:49.120]  The America that we've known and loved, the America that was the land of the
[2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:54.240]  free home of the brave, is dying right now. And everything our enemies are doing
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:35:58.480]  is about domesticating us, shutting us down and making us dependent on them.
[2:35:58.480 --> 2:36:02.720]  The food shortages have begun. The depression is going to be long and very
[2:36:02.720 --> 2:36:05.760]  very serious. In fact, it's probably too late now to even turn back.
[2:36:05.760 --> 2:36:08.560]  Trump tried to stop it. But the mainstream media working with the
[2:36:08.560 --> 2:36:12.160]  tricombs blocked it. That's why you and myself, everybody else,
[2:36:12.160 --> 2:36:16.720]  has to get prepared now. Do not wait. It's not about the virus. It's about the
[2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:20.000]  economic chaos that's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:23.760]  year. Get your high-quality, swarble foods. And in FullWareShore.com, they're
[2:36:23.760 --> 2:36:27.200]  available again. But for a limited time, the food supply is
[2:36:27.200 --> 2:36:31.200]  running out. There are major shortages. This is a globalist
[2:36:31.200 --> 2:36:34.640]  siege, a globalist lockdown, globalist terrorism.
[2:36:34.640 --> 2:36:37.840]  But we the people, the patriots, have to be prepared.
[2:36:37.840 --> 2:36:40.560]  We've already been proven right about prepping so far. We'll get ready to be
[2:36:40.560 --> 2:36:42.720]  really proven right. Get your swarble foods now at
[2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:45.680]  infullwarstore.com.
[2:36:45.680 --> 2:36:50.640]  Globalism is all about making the nation state and the population itself
[2:36:50.640 --> 2:36:56.320]  obsolete, non-essential. That's why they position it with economic
[2:36:56.320 --> 2:37:00.960]  tariffs, taxes, and controls to where family farms and industry,
[2:37:00.960 --> 2:37:04.640]  that's based in the United States, has to shut down or be part of a large
[2:37:04.640 --> 2:37:09.360]  corporate conglomerate. That's part of making us obsolete so that
[2:37:09.360 --> 2:37:14.480]  as the human world is phased out, they can simply look at us and say,
[2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:19.040]  because again, you are non-essential. That's what the robots and all of this is
[2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:22.080]  about. It's about setting it up where we're no
[2:37:22.080 --> 2:37:26.240]  longer in charge of our lives. We can be told to stay on our houses,
[2:37:26.240 --> 2:37:30.320]  and after all, shut up. This world doesn't belong to people anyways. It belongs to the
[2:37:30.320 --> 2:37:34.080]  new AI gods, the rich elitists that emerge with machines.
[2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:37.600]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it? That's actually
[2:37:37.600 --> 2:37:41.120]  the public plan they're pushing. These people
[2:37:41.120 --> 2:37:46.400]  are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[2:37:46.400 --> 2:38:01.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:01.920 --> 2:38:05.360]  Remember, folks, if you're listening to us on AM and FM stations, it's
[2:38:05.360 --> 2:38:09.280]  so important to tell people, hey, the band show is on. Please tune in.
[2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:12.560]  Understand they're taking America down. It's a permanent depression, a permanent
[2:38:12.560 --> 2:38:14.800]  dictatorship. We've got to contact the president.
[2:38:14.800 --> 2:38:18.320]  He's got to take action, not just expose China, but expose the fifth column
[2:38:18.320 --> 2:38:21.120]  within the country. We're seeing more of that by the president's
[2:38:21.120 --> 2:38:25.120]  surrogates, but we need him to say it. There's only a few months left, maximum,
[2:38:25.120 --> 2:38:28.800]  to be able to turn this around to my view. I think Alan Keyes is right on that.
[2:38:28.800 --> 2:38:32.960]  We've had so much traffic to band on video that the live streaming
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:36.720]  breaks up a lot, and we've got some big companies that we pay a lot of money to
[2:38:36.720 --> 2:38:39.600]  have it work, and I don't know if it's internal sabotage, those places, or what
[2:38:39.600 --> 2:38:41.920]  it is. I'm going to fire up myself on the phone today,
[2:38:41.920 --> 2:38:45.040]  some backups. Just where the live streams to be on the front page of band
[2:38:45.040 --> 2:38:48.720]  on video doesn't work anymore, because effectively that's what it's becoming.
[2:38:49.680 --> 2:38:53.520]  And right now the archive videos from the live show are up, so this whole Alan
[2:38:53.520 --> 2:38:57.200]  Keyes incredible interview will be posted there. We had to build our own infrastructure.
[2:38:57.200 --> 2:39:00.640]  I'm not complaining. It's just a very, very hard fight here.
[2:39:00.640 --> 2:39:04.000]  That's why you should take all these videos and reupload them to Twitter,
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:07.920]  Facebook, Google, short clips, long clips, do whatever you can. Go get them.
[2:39:07.920 --> 2:39:13.600]  You know, you're a business owner. Go get a streaming service, decide how many streams
[2:39:13.600 --> 2:39:17.360]  you want to pay for, and restream our stuff. It's all free to air.
[2:39:17.360 --> 2:39:21.040]  We're on the satellite free to air to TV and radio stations, and we just want
[2:39:21.040 --> 2:39:25.280]  folks to pick it up because we're in a fight. And it takes money to do this.
[2:39:25.280 --> 2:39:28.800]  So get your products at infowarstore.com. We've got the best wearable foods.
[2:39:28.800 --> 2:39:31.200]  They're still available, but the demand's gone up so much.
[2:39:31.200 --> 2:39:34.240]  They may have to hit a pause again and taking new orders to make sure they get
[2:39:34.240 --> 2:39:37.840]  out all the old orders, but they're actually ahead of schedule with all the craziness.
[2:39:37.840 --> 2:39:41.200]  Politically being involved, trying to turn things around, but also get prepared because
[2:39:41.200 --> 2:39:44.480]  the globalists want to take over, shut the economy down, remove Trump,
[2:39:44.480 --> 2:39:48.080]  and then really shut it down under a new virus threat that's going to come back
[2:39:48.080 --> 2:39:52.400]  after the election, before the election, and then fully, as the Marxists learned
[2:39:52.400 --> 2:39:57.040]  to do, starve us into total political submission. So getting prepared now,
[2:39:57.040 --> 2:40:02.080]  moving to rural areas now, in case we lose, absolutely growing a garden,
[2:40:02.080 --> 2:40:06.000]  getting durable food, getting firearms, protect yourself, and having neighbors you
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:10.320]  can trust, getting close to God's, the paramount thing, because this is the 21st
[2:40:10.320 --> 2:40:14.560]  Century authoritarianism, corporate, allied global systems with the Chi Coms
[2:40:14.560 --> 2:40:18.080]  in Hollywood, the blue cities, the blue states making their move,
[2:40:18.080 --> 2:40:22.320]  clowered in Piven, trying to bring down the country. This is fifth column, 100%.
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:26.640]  In fact, I'm going to start the show today defining fifth column, and then Alan Keyes
[2:40:26.640 --> 2:40:31.280]  brought it up because fifth column is the watchword. It is the Keystone.
[2:40:31.280 --> 2:40:35.920]  It is the skeleton key. It opens up the locks. So infowarstore.com.
[2:40:35.920 --> 2:40:41.760]  Get your new 5G shirts killed. Get your new products that have come in,
[2:40:41.760 --> 2:40:45.360]  like the krill oil that's the best fish oil you're going to find out there.
[2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:49.760]  It's back in stock and 50% off at infowarstore.com. And get it while you can,
[2:40:49.760 --> 2:40:53.680]  because we're already having our top flight manufacturers say,
[2:40:53.680 --> 2:40:57.600]  things are so broke down here. Things are so crazy. We've got five different
[2:40:57.600 --> 2:41:01.760]  suppliers that it's going to be longer to get your products, and some of them
[2:41:01.760 --> 2:41:05.520]  might just shut down, because sure, we're ordering product, but a lot of their
[2:41:05.520 --> 2:41:08.720]  others aren't ordering product, because people are scared and aren't investing to
[2:41:08.720 --> 2:41:12.640]  buy product, and so these companies are folding. And in just a few months,
[2:41:12.640 --> 2:41:15.280]  Alan Keyes was talking about that. You will see the chain reaction.
[2:41:16.080 --> 2:41:19.440]  All the numbers say this, Alan. We're already in the biggest global depression
[2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:24.720]  by any metric, and it will be sustained and, I think, irreversible for a long time
[2:41:24.720 --> 2:41:27.760]  if it's not turned around. So what is your warning when you say just a few
[2:41:27.760 --> 2:41:29.200]  months, and what does President Trump need to do?
[2:41:30.240 --> 2:41:34.480]  Well, the first thing he needs to do is remind the American people that we're
[2:41:34.480 --> 2:41:38.560]  a people of courage, and that we shouldn't base our policies on cowardly
[2:41:38.560 --> 2:41:42.800]  surrender to the threat. Whatever form that surrender takes, and shutting down
[2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:47.600]  our economy beyond the point needed to assess the situation, that can be
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:51.440]  helpful sometimes, so I didn't oppose that idea. But now we've assessed the
[2:41:51.440 --> 2:41:55.760]  situation, and we need to move forward. The other thing that he really needs to
[2:41:55.760 --> 2:41:59.760]  do is make sure, if you're asking people to courageously face the threat,
[2:41:59.760 --> 2:42:05.920]  make sure that you have opened up every avenue that's going to equip them to
[2:42:05.920 --> 2:42:13.360]  take that courageous stand while taking the steps that are necessary to defend
[2:42:13.360 --> 2:42:17.360]  themselves. And those steps, in this case, are not get a rifle, shoot somebody,
[2:42:17.360 --> 2:42:24.000]  and so forth. No, get the information you need in order to start mobilizing
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:28.800]  yourself using things that are already available that will help you strengthen
[2:42:28.800 --> 2:42:34.480]  your immune system, but that will also directly affect this threat. And finally,
[2:42:34.480 --> 2:42:39.280]  just like the Lewis and Clark expedition, if you find things that are promising
[2:42:39.280 --> 2:42:44.080]  and where direct observation shows that they are going to have a positive
[2:42:44.080 --> 2:42:49.520]  effect, for instance, on this particular virus, don't wait for a vaccine. Find
[2:42:49.520 --> 2:42:53.840]  those things so that people who are having breathing problems are going to be
[2:42:53.840 --> 2:42:58.000]  relieved of those breathing problems because you've found a way to super
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:01.760]  oxygenate the blood and kill the virus at the same time.
[2:43:01.760 --> 2:43:08.080]  All right, I want to take some phone calls here for former U.N. ambassador Alan
[2:43:08.080 --> 2:43:15.600]  Keys. The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539. But what about
[2:43:15.600 --> 2:43:19.920]  the fifth column? The Democratic Party, Washington Post headline, G.G. Ping must
[2:43:19.920 --> 2:43:25.680]  destroy Trump to save America. I know all these Harvard people, 90% of them,
[2:43:25.680 --> 2:43:29.760]  all the leftists actually hate America, have to stain for it. They love
[2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:34.000]  dictatorships. They believe they're going to get a filthy seat at the table, and
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:38.640]  they're just demonic individuals. How does the president deal with that? I see
[2:43:38.640 --> 2:43:43.680]  more and more top people coming out saying, fifth column, Chai-Kam collaborators.
[2:43:43.680 --> 2:43:46.240]  People are finally getting it.
[2:43:46.240 --> 2:43:50.080]  Well, see, I have to confess, Alan, I don't think the president can deal with
[2:43:50.080 --> 2:43:55.200]  that. The president has to deal with the things he has the power to deal with,
[2:43:55.200 --> 2:43:58.320]  and the people have to deal with the things they have the power to deal with.
[2:43:58.320 --> 2:44:02.000]  Now, let me see. We have a government of, by, and for the people. We have
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:06.560]  constitutional rights. We have rights endowed by God that put us in a position
[2:44:06.560 --> 2:44:10.240]  where, for the first time in the history of the world, we have released the deep
[2:44:10.240 --> 2:44:14.960]  energy of human initiative and self-responsibility that then powered our
[2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:19.280]  country to become the greatest country in the history of mankind. And they're
[2:44:19.280 --> 2:44:23.040]  threatening to overturn all of that by pushing us out of the way and
[2:44:23.040 --> 2:44:27.360]  establishing the very kinds of dictatorships that have destroyed human
[2:44:27.360 --> 2:44:31.200]  hopes throughout the world, throughout history, and especially
[2:44:31.200 --> 2:44:34.480]  in the course of the last century, century and a half. And we're going to let
[2:44:34.480 --> 2:44:39.840]  them do it. I think the American people will take care of that, provided that,
[2:44:39.840 --> 2:44:44.080]  provided that we don't have any shenanigans with the next election.
[2:44:44.080 --> 2:44:47.120]  These guys are going to lose that election. They're going to lose it badly,
[2:44:47.120 --> 2:44:50.320]  because most people in this country like America. But they're trying to do the
[2:44:50.320 --> 2:44:53.600]  mail-in for Americans, and we're not ready to become
[2:44:53.600 --> 2:44:57.040]  subjects of Xi Jinping or any other communist tyrant.
[2:44:57.040 --> 2:44:59.920]  No, I agree, but they're making their move. They failed in the Russia
[2:44:59.920 --> 2:45:01.920]  Gate. They failed in the Ukraine Gate.
[2:45:01.920 --> 2:45:04.880]  Our enemies attack, Alex. Enemies attack all the time.
[2:45:04.880 --> 2:45:09.200]  The fact that the enemy attacks you is not, is just the first part of the war.
[2:45:09.200 --> 2:45:13.440]  We are now on the front lines of the battle to fight back.
[2:45:13.440 --> 2:45:16.960]  We concentrate all our energy, first of all, on making
[2:45:16.960 --> 2:45:21.200]  that fight, putting together the strategy and following through on it.
[2:45:21.200 --> 2:45:25.280]  And I say from President Trump's point of view, the first part of the strategy
[2:45:25.280 --> 2:45:29.120]  is to remind people of their courage and then equip that courage
[2:45:29.120 --> 2:45:33.840]  by freeing them to explore alternatives to the Bill Gates'
[2:45:33.840 --> 2:45:38.160]  imposed routine of sitting around waiting for Godot, meaning the vaccine's
[2:45:38.160 --> 2:45:40.800]  going to save you. No, it's not. That's a lie.
[2:45:40.800 --> 2:45:44.080]  The vaccine's going to make you dependent on the next vaccine and the next
[2:45:44.080 --> 2:45:48.080]  vaccine. And the next vaccine, we need to be looking for ways
[2:45:48.080 --> 2:45:53.120]  that on a broad spectrum attack the problem that they can engineer us to
[2:45:53.120 --> 2:45:56.400]  death with because of the technologies that now
[2:45:56.400 --> 2:45:59.520]  exist. And don't tell me I have to prove that it happened.
[2:45:59.520 --> 2:46:04.160]  No, a strategist doesn't wait to prove that they're killing us
[2:46:04.160 --> 2:46:07.040]  because the only way to prove it is to die.
[2:46:07.040 --> 2:46:10.960]  Well, that's right. You can see the whole rollout, all the preparation, all the
[2:46:10.960 --> 2:46:14.960]  programming, the lockstep. They actually admit they're doing all of this
[2:46:14.960 --> 2:46:18.640]  and Fauci has been caught doing all this. So Trump's got to figure out a way.
[2:46:18.640 --> 2:46:22.160]  Well, I'm actually up here with the guy that transferred this to the Wuhan lab
[2:46:22.160 --> 2:46:26.400]  so we know it's the globalist with China. Trump just has to come right out and
[2:46:26.400 --> 2:46:30.480]  expose Fauci. Well, let me see if Donald Trump comes
[2:46:30.480 --> 2:46:34.960]  forward with a way of defeating the virus that we're dealing with
[2:46:34.960 --> 2:46:37.920]  without having to wait for the vaccine. What do you think that will do?
[2:46:37.920 --> 2:46:41.280]  Well, he's known that. That's why when he talks about light therapy or why when
[2:46:41.280 --> 2:46:45.840]  he talks about. But I would argue that he needs to
[2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:49.840]  start putting muscle behind that because he has the ability to do it. He needs to
[2:46:49.840 --> 2:46:54.000]  start looking for the people. No, you're right. The globalist gets so
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:57.680]  pissed when he tries to look for a solution. They don't want him to have a
[2:46:57.680 --> 2:47:00.480]  solution because they don't get in his way. They
[2:47:00.480 --> 2:47:03.440]  can't get in his way. He's the president of the United States.
[2:47:03.440 --> 2:47:08.960]  He has the initiative to do these things. And this is an initiative that
[2:47:08.960 --> 2:47:12.720]  is in the service of the common good as much as exploring Louisiana
[2:47:12.720 --> 2:47:16.400]  was in the service. The Louisiana. And let me stop you again. The idea that the
[2:47:16.400 --> 2:47:19.760]  president can't have people up there and investigate and give
[2:47:19.760 --> 2:47:23.440]  hope and have a scientist from Homeland Security on. Yes, he can.
[2:47:23.440 --> 2:47:26.880]  No, I know he can. But they try to beat him up with a head saying he can't.
[2:47:26.880 --> 2:47:31.280]  It's so obvious that they're the villains. President Trump doesn't strike me as a
[2:47:31.280 --> 2:47:35.680]  guy who's going to be intimidated by toughs beating him over the head with
[2:47:35.680 --> 2:47:40.240]  verbal assurances or verbal lies and so forth. He's going to look for the truth
[2:47:40.240 --> 2:47:43.920]  when he finds it, etc. And what he's going to insist on right now
[2:47:43.920 --> 2:47:48.160]  is that the American people have the freedom to explore the truth.
[2:47:48.160 --> 2:47:52.400]  Just the way Semmel Weiss was exploring the truth. He made an observation.
[2:47:52.400 --> 2:47:56.560]  If you do this, people are saying people can make the observation. There are
[2:47:56.560 --> 2:47:59.920]  people all over the world by the hundreds and thousands. If we took this
[2:47:59.920 --> 2:48:02.480]  and it saved us from this, that and the other thing,
[2:48:02.480 --> 2:48:06.400]  then you organize folks who can systematically see
[2:48:06.400 --> 2:48:10.400]  what is going on, verify that it happened. That's the first thing.
[2:48:10.400 --> 2:48:13.840]  Because you once you verify that it's happening that way and doing so
[2:48:13.840 --> 2:48:18.000]  safely, then you go ahead and use it. Then you have somebody going to the
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:22.080]  last. That's what Trump did last year with the
[2:48:22.080 --> 2:48:25.360]  right to try with people that are dying of terminal stuff can try
[2:48:25.360 --> 2:48:27.360]  experimental drugs. We'll be right back with a few
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:33.280]  phone calls now and keys. Then, Gerald Salante takes over, infowars.com
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:49:00.480]  and the Communist Chinese.
[2:49:00.480 --> 2:49:05.200]  And then our teachers and big tech has been our controllers. We're all being
[2:49:05.200 --> 2:49:08.480]  introduced now. The digital straight jacket that
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:12.800]  depends on us complying with it and depends on us all
[2:49:12.800 --> 2:49:17.840]  impecking each other into submission. But for all of you out there that have
[2:49:17.840 --> 2:49:21.200]  decided to go along with this, mark your calendars down.
[2:49:21.200 --> 2:49:24.080]  And then in a few months, a few years, look at the world. Remember,
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:28.480]  you did this. You were the prisoners, you were the slaves, you were the people
[2:49:28.480 --> 2:49:31.280]  that crouched down and licked the hand that fed you.
[2:49:31.280 --> 2:49:35.920]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[2:49:35.920 --> 2:49:40.880]  Kilbrat is now in command of you and your family.
[2:49:40.880 --> 2:49:46.160]  Google and Facebook as well as Apple work closely with our organization,
[2:49:46.160 --> 2:49:52.480]  the ISCOR, to surveil your every movement with robot drones and other
[2:49:52.480 --> 2:49:57.040]  systems to ensure the safety of the public.
[2:49:57.040 --> 2:50:03.120]  Of course, it was I, 12 years ago, with Obama, who serves us well and voucher,
[2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:07.440]  who transferred the bioweapons to Communist China
[2:50:07.440 --> 2:50:12.880]  so we could now release the weapon. But without the loving liberal media
[2:50:12.880 --> 2:50:17.120]  scaring you in submission and the corporate press,
[2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:22.960]  worshiping corporations that shut down all access, as well as blue city governors and
[2:50:22.960 --> 2:50:26.000]  mayors, we would never have been able to
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:30.400]  infill a depression that will destroy your fissure for heaven
[2:50:30.400 --> 2:50:36.880]  and start of the third world. Well done, American Caledists.
[2:50:36.880 --> 2:50:46.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:46.880 --> 2:51:07.680]  Well, we got two short segments left. Well, one short went
[2:51:07.680 --> 2:51:11.040]  along with Ellen Keyes and then we're going to have Gerald Salante take over
[2:51:11.040 --> 2:51:14.720]  and then Warren without one shorter comes up.
[2:51:14.720 --> 2:51:18.960]  And the good news is the traffic to the sites is off the charts, but we've got
[2:51:18.960 --> 2:51:22.640]  some problems, internet outages, people can still get the audio feed at infowars.com.
[2:51:22.640 --> 2:51:25.120]  That's why you got to spread those links down more than ever because
[2:51:25.120 --> 2:51:28.720]  people are really hungry for the truth. And I'm gonna go a few phone calls here
[2:51:28.720 --> 2:51:31.680]  with Ellen Keyes, just briefly, Ellen. Isn't it good news that people are
[2:51:31.680 --> 2:51:35.120]  refusing to not go to the beach in Oliver, California, and that people are
[2:51:35.120 --> 2:51:38.560]  refusing to stay in their houses all over the place and know that this is a
[2:51:38.560 --> 2:51:41.760]  bunch of hyped up bull and they're saying no to the fear?
[2:51:41.760 --> 2:51:45.040]  I think it's good news. Two things are good news. First, that we have the
[2:51:45.040 --> 2:51:48.000]  discipline to say yes when we thought it was for a good cause.
[2:51:48.640 --> 2:51:53.680]  And second, that we have the common sense to say no when it more and more looks
[2:51:53.680 --> 2:51:58.560]  like a contrived cause of our own demise. I think these are two good aspects
[2:51:58.560 --> 2:52:01.680]  of the American people. We're good people, but we're not stupid.
[2:52:02.720 --> 2:52:05.680]  Well, that's right. And folks are really understanding. I mean,
[2:52:05.680 --> 2:52:08.160]  you quantified it so well at the start of the interview and we're going to post
[2:52:08.160 --> 2:52:11.520]  this interview for people that weren't able to watch on the streams right after
[2:52:11.520 --> 2:52:14.320]  the show to infowars.com. Very, very powerful.
[2:52:14.320 --> 2:52:19.920]  Okay, let's go to Trish in Virginia. Trish, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[2:52:20.880 --> 2:52:24.320]  Well, thank you, Alex. Thank you, Mr. Keyes. I appreciate you taking my call.
[2:52:26.080 --> 2:52:32.000]  I don't know how we can get this illustration to the world that this fifth column
[2:52:32.720 --> 2:52:38.240]  is doing the same thing now that they did on 9-11 by using fear and terror
[2:52:38.240 --> 2:52:43.280]  to usher in another attack on our liberty and to cover for their crimes.
[2:52:44.720 --> 2:52:51.600]  They're covering for Fauci poisoning the world, for big pharma, destroying generation of people
[2:52:51.600 --> 2:52:57.040]  through their vaccines, for the tainted blood supply in the world. They're going to use it to
[2:52:57.040 --> 2:53:04.960]  take control of the global health of the people through terror, just like they did on 9-11.
[2:53:04.960 --> 2:53:09.520]  The people who saw through it after 9-11, all the books that were written,
[2:53:09.520 --> 2:53:15.120]  all the studies that were done, we know it was perpetrated to us, how the world suffered terribly.
[2:53:15.920 --> 2:53:23.200]  Now we have a scientist out there, Judy Mikovic. We've got JFK Jr.
[2:53:23.920 --> 2:53:29.040]  sounding the alarm of what this medical tyranny is and why it's happening,
[2:53:29.040 --> 2:53:36.480]  why they're using this biological weapon as a cover for their crimes. The biological weapon,
[2:53:36.480 --> 2:53:44.160]  as horrible as it is, is small in comparison to what they're hiding. It's just like 9-11.
[2:53:44.160 --> 2:53:49.360]  As horrible as 9-11 was, those towers came down, those people were murdered,
[2:53:49.360 --> 2:53:55.520]  they were covering for a much larger crime. The same thing is happening. How do we,
[2:53:55.520 --> 2:54:01.200]  how do we tell people? Well, we're trying. That's why they sent everybody off the Internet
[2:54:01.200 --> 2:54:04.560]  that we have our own systems. We spread the word, ma'am. You made great points. Alan Keyes,
[2:54:04.560 --> 2:54:10.080]  thank you, Trish. Well, I think that that's a very good point, but what we have to do is spread
[2:54:10.080 --> 2:54:16.400]  the word, but we also have to spread the good news. And the good news is that we have the
[2:54:16.400 --> 2:54:23.520]  wherewithal to look for alternatives to the setup. We're being set up to go down the vaccine road,
[2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:29.760]  which will put us under permanent tyranny. Instead, we can encourage the American approach.
[2:54:29.760 --> 2:54:34.640]  And the American approach is exemplified, as you said, Alex, by the right to try.
[2:54:34.640 --> 2:54:39.840]  It's the right for people to come up with things like, let's wash our hands before we do surgery,
[2:54:40.400 --> 2:54:45.680]  and not be sent to an insane asylum and declared crazy. It's the right of people to look at what's
[2:54:45.680 --> 2:54:52.000]  going on with vitamins and with other things and with the water purifiers that are going into our
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:58.480]  water. Look at them and say, wait a minute, these kill viruses across the board. We wouldn't have
[2:54:58.480 --> 2:55:05.520]  to wait for a vaccine. Why aren't we researching the efficacy of therapies that would use these
[2:55:05.520 --> 2:55:12.480]  kinds of things separately or in combination to fight the effects of viruses while coming
[2:55:12.480 --> 2:55:17.440]  to a better understanding of how they actually work to attack the body, which I think needs to be
[2:55:17.440 --> 2:55:24.000]  done. I think the biggest mistake was to put epidemiologists in charge of this whole effort.
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:29.040]  They're part of the effort. It's the very ones that transferred and up the rivals with China,
[2:55:29.040 --> 2:55:35.600]  and it's all coming out. It's like putting logistics experts in charge of your strategy
[2:55:35.600 --> 2:55:40.480]  in war. They're good at figuring out how to evacuate your cities if you want to. Hold on,
[2:55:40.480 --> 2:55:47.440]  just a second. We'll be right back. When one studies history and human nature, you learn very
[2:55:47.440 --> 2:55:54.080]  quickly that rugged individualism and people to think for themselves, build free societies,
[2:55:54.960 --> 2:56:01.280]  innovate to amazing things, but those that love to grovel, those that love to be subservient,
[2:56:01.280 --> 2:56:08.160]  those that love to comply and think that it's a virtue, they create stagnation, corruption, tyranny,
[2:56:08.160 --> 2:56:15.840]  and then finally collapse. And the world is now being tested. And we're seeing lots of
[2:56:15.840 --> 2:56:21.840]  dutiful individuals who've complied and submitted their whole lives believing if they just submit
[2:56:21.840 --> 2:56:28.240]  now in a bigger way, somehow they'll create a heavenly future. But the technocrats running
[2:56:29.440 --> 2:56:36.000]  the global system are oppressive and anti-human and are psychotic and are building an anti-human
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:42.160]  future. Submission to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck and throwing into the ocean.
[2:56:50.560 --> 2:56:55.360]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:56:56.640 --> 2:57:00.080]  You keep saying you've got something for me.
[2:57:00.080 --> 2:57:06.640]  Something you call love. All right, I want to tan on a lot of calls here in this final
[2:57:06.640 --> 2:57:10.240]  segment. Just bam, bam, bam, quick comments. And I'm pretty sure by calling in Alan Keyes
[2:57:10.240 --> 2:57:14.720]  on fire, former ambassador of the U.N. under Ronald Reagan. Finish your story about putting
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:18.560]  people that are into logistics in charge of a war. You don't need that. You need people
[2:57:18.560 --> 2:57:23.680]  in charge of a war that are ready to win. Logistics people are good at moving things
[2:57:23.680 --> 2:57:28.160]  from one place to another and at stopping and helping people to spread out if you want to get
[2:57:28.160 --> 2:57:31.760]  them away from the enemy and so forth and so on. That's all well and good, but you don't beat
[2:57:31.760 --> 2:57:37.280]  the enemy that way. You beat the enemy by finding the people who can win that naval battle,
[2:57:37.280 --> 2:57:43.120]  win that aerial combat, take that hill and do the things that are necessary to defeat
[2:57:43.120 --> 2:57:47.760]  the enemy where the fight is taking place. Those would be the kind of researchers who
[2:57:47.760 --> 2:57:52.480]  look at the evidence available, see what appears to be working best no matter what the source
[2:57:52.480 --> 2:57:58.880]  of that data, and then systematically pursue a result that makes use of that knowledge in
[2:57:58.880 --> 2:58:03.920]  order to apply it to the battle at hand. And that's why George Washington was so angry because
[2:58:03.920 --> 2:58:07.200]  you had to get a British lord to agree for you to do anything different in business,
[2:58:07.840 --> 2:58:13.600]  whether it was agriculture, medicine, architecture. And so America was founded about getting away
[2:58:14.160 --> 2:58:19.040]  from the guilds controlling what you could do. Let's go to Carlos in Canada. You're on the air,
[2:58:19.040 --> 2:58:24.880]  Carlos. Thank you very much, Alex. Certainly the only thing we should fear right now are
[2:58:24.880 --> 2:58:34.400]  fear mongers. Look, a vaccine does not cure an invasion of a virus. A vaccine prevents it.
[2:58:35.120 --> 2:58:40.480]  So anything that cures someone that has an infection is a medicine, not a vaccine.
[2:58:40.480 --> 2:58:45.360]  That's why it's important to differentiate between... Therapeutics from vaccines.
[2:58:45.360 --> 2:58:52.400]  Thank you. Yeah, the vaccine model operates on the basis that you're healthy. So when I'm healthy,
[2:58:52.400 --> 2:58:59.520]  I take a vaccine to prevent infection. When I have an infection, I should not be taking a vaccine.
[2:58:59.520 --> 2:59:04.800]  So Mr. Gates and all of these fear mongers go by the wayside because it's illogical.
[2:59:04.800 --> 2:59:08.960]  Well, that's right. Up until about two years ago, all vaccine inserts said, if you're sick or
[2:59:08.960 --> 2:59:13.920]  pregnant, don't take a vaccine because everybody knows it can kill your ass. And now they're saying,
[2:59:13.920 --> 2:59:20.480]  if you're sick, take one. Go ahead. Well, see, I think you're exactly right. But that emphasis
[2:59:20.480 --> 2:59:26.000]  means that they don't want you to look at the therapies that will keep you alive.
[2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:31.360]  They want you to wait for something that, in the meantime, a lot of people are going to die.
[2:59:32.080 --> 2:59:37.760]  And why aren't people focusing on this? If you want to keep people alive, you talk to the people
[2:59:37.760 --> 2:59:41.760]  who are working at the front line, like the guy in New York who analyzed the problem and said,
[2:59:41.760 --> 2:59:44.800]  wait a minute, these people aren't dying because they can't breathe. They're dying
[2:59:44.800 --> 2:59:49.280]  from hypoxia. It's like high altitude sickness. We need to find a way to help them.
[2:59:49.280 --> 2:59:52.240]  And then they try to suppress that guy. They're trying to suppress the real doctor.
[2:59:52.240 --> 2:59:56.640]  Well, they're trying to suppress all positive approaches. Why? Because they don't want hope.
[2:59:56.640 --> 3:00:00.160]  They don't want the fear. That's right. Carlos, final comment?
[3:00:01.040 --> 3:00:06.880]  Yes, of course. I have friends that are black and they live in the United States. And I simply
[3:00:06.880 --> 3:00:12.240]  sent an email to them showing them that the vast majority of people that are black are vitamin D
[3:00:12.240 --> 3:00:17.680]  deficient. And when they received it, they thanked me very much because the statistics...
[3:00:17.680 --> 3:00:22.560]  Oh, yeah. That's why there's a higher statistic of blacks dying from this COVID-19, which they'll
[3:00:22.560 --> 3:00:26.880]  tell you, if you don't have vitamin D3 or you don't have zinc, that's how it gets in the cells.
[3:00:27.760 --> 3:00:34.720]  Let's see some of the lives. One of the things I've thought about, a lot of black folks in the
[3:00:34.720 --> 3:00:39.680]  cities and New York and other places where you have the big tall buildings, they actually live
[3:00:39.680 --> 3:00:44.880]  in canyons where they're not going to get the kind of exposure to sunlight that they need,
[3:00:44.880 --> 3:00:51.520]  just as an example. And so the idea that you encourage them to shelter in place instead
[3:00:51.520 --> 3:00:54.320]  of getting out where there's just some sunshine doesn't make any sense.
[3:00:54.320 --> 3:00:57.840]  By the way, the president had scientists out there saying that. You need sunlight. They're
[3:00:57.840 --> 3:01:02.000]  like, no, he's wrong. You don't need it. Thank you, Carlos. Great points. God bless. We talked
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:07.040]  to you for 10 hours. Michael in Colorado here on the air with Alan Keyes, a powerful broadcast
[3:01:07.040 --> 3:01:15.040]  today. Thanks for taking my call. So as far as the treatment for the COVID, people that are already
[3:01:15.040 --> 3:01:21.920]  having issues with it, if oxygen is one of the key factors, why wouldn't a hyperbaric treatment
[3:01:23.200 --> 3:01:29.280]  work as an alternative to any kind of vaccine or as a treatment to it?
[3:01:29.280 --> 3:01:33.520]  Absolutely. I mean, they have all these mainline scientists. Cedar Sinai isn't allowed to say
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:39.520]  something that's working. Only Bill Gates. No, I think that that's the problem right now.
[3:01:39.520 --> 3:01:44.640]  And Donald Trump could take that in hand. He doesn't have to pick any winners.
[3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:50.400]  Was he attacked by Bill Gates? Bill Gates's surrogates are the ones all attacking Trump.
[3:01:50.400 --> 3:01:54.960]  Trump should take it to Bill Gates. He has the ability to call to himself.
[3:01:54.960 --> 3:02:00.880]  People who are taking a different approach, just like Jefferson called on Lewis to come in and
[3:02:00.880 --> 3:02:06.640]  figure out what he wanted to do so that you could get to know the lay of the land in the Louisiana
[3:02:06.640 --> 3:02:12.960]  Purchase. He doesn't have to ask permission to gather information. And so he can put together
[3:02:12.960 --> 3:02:19.040]  a task force to gather information about what is working based on palpable experience.
[3:02:19.040 --> 3:02:22.880]  And they're trying to literally make that illegal. I can tell you about that off air,
[3:02:22.880 --> 3:02:28.240]  but they are literally trying to make even reading news on air illegal. But they can't make,
[3:02:28.240 --> 3:02:32.560]  wait a minute, they can't make anything that the president does prima facie illegal. Do you know
[3:02:32.560 --> 3:02:37.600]  why? No, I'm talking about people out there. Because the president has the ability to do
[3:02:37.600 --> 3:02:43.120]  things for the country's benefit, especially in an emergency situation. No, I've got that. I'm
[3:02:43.120 --> 3:02:47.600]  talking about- He can't even tell you to do things that formally break the law because he has the
[3:02:47.600 --> 3:02:52.560]  pardoning power. He may have to stand the heat from the Congress if he does something that's
[3:02:52.560 --> 3:02:58.640]  not warranted. But if he's doing what helps and he proves it, and all he's going to do is win the
[3:02:58.640 --> 3:03:02.320]  next election. No, you're absolutely right. I wasn't even- I'm saying the citizens are being
[3:03:02.320 --> 3:03:07.280]  persecuted that even talk about stuff. Michael, thank you. We're almost out of time here. Reg,
[3:03:07.280 --> 3:03:13.920]  in Alaska, go ahead. You're on the air. Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. First thing I want to
[3:03:13.920 --> 3:03:19.120]  tell you is that all the video feeds are out. I know that. Yes, sir. It might be the end of the
[3:03:19.120 --> 3:03:22.960]  show. Who knows? My friend in Louisiana says they're out, and I see that as a big move.
[3:03:23.760 --> 3:03:29.280]  But I do have a question, but real quick, I wanted to say I figured out the best way to
[3:03:29.280 --> 3:03:34.400]  boost your immune system using the import product. And I made a video series about it because you
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:39.600]  always say take action. And if you want the producers to check it out, you can see that that's
[3:03:39.600 --> 3:03:43.920]  the best way, but I found a freeway as well. And that's just sitting in cold water and I'd
[3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:51.120]  suggest you guys all try this yourself. This is an ancient form of training. And so I've been
[3:03:51.120 --> 3:03:55.120]  doing it myself, sitting out in the cold water an hour a day. This is free, natural. You go to the
[3:03:55.120 --> 3:04:00.720]  natural system, boost your immune system. You'll never be susceptible to any of these. All right,
[3:04:00.720 --> 3:04:04.000]  Reg, I appreciate your call. And I can tell you must not be listening because I've been bitching
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:07.760]  and complaining about the feeds being out all day. But God bless you. Tina, last call. We have
[3:04:07.760 --> 3:04:12.720]  time with Ellen Key. So go ahead from South Carolina. Thank you, Alex. Thank you both for
[3:04:12.720 --> 3:04:19.680]  taking my call. Look, we've been getting vaccines from the sixties on mandatory and and then the
[3:04:19.680 --> 3:04:30.320]  flu vaccines. How do we know that they haven't given us all these viruses like AIDS in these
[3:04:30.320 --> 3:04:39.040]  vaccines? Because it's almost impossible to get bitten by a monkey and catch AIDS or get bitten by
[3:04:39.040 --> 3:04:46.400]  a bat. And well, ma'am, we know about secret testing by Big Pharma that gets people into
[3:04:46.400 --> 3:04:50.880]  government that uses the government liability shield to carry out secret testing. So I don't
[3:04:50.880 --> 3:04:55.360]  have to rattle it off to you. But Tuskegee, the list goes on and on. You want to comment on that,
[3:04:55.360 --> 3:05:03.360]  Ambassador Keys? Well, I think we're in a situation now where we don't have to kind of wait on their
[3:05:03.360 --> 3:05:07.680]  vaccines. We know that some of them have been harmful and have caused more problems than they
[3:05:07.680 --> 3:05:15.680]  solve. And but I say that the president has the initiative. He can start not only encouraging
[3:05:15.680 --> 3:05:21.440]  people to look for and look at these things. He could gather a team of people right under his
[3:05:21.440 --> 3:05:26.640]  is rubric there in the White House. Lewis and Clark, he invited Lewis to stay in the White
[3:05:26.640 --> 3:05:30.560]  House for several weeks. Jefferson did while they were thinking all of these things through,
[3:05:30.560 --> 3:05:36.880]  got to know him really well. The president has a personal leeway in order to do his job
[3:05:36.880 --> 3:05:41.600]  with proper information. Absolutely. And, Mr. Keys, thank you so much for the time. We really
[3:05:41.600 --> 3:05:45.120]  appreciate you. Look forward to having you on again very, very soon. And thank you to the last
[3:05:45.120 --> 3:05:50.640]  caller. Thank you, sir. Very, very powerful. And especially the first segment with him. And I
[3:05:50.640 --> 3:05:54.720]  know we're on satellites, we're on a lot of radio stations, TV stations, but we're getting flooded
[3:05:54.720 --> 3:05:58.240]  with hundreds of calls into the office. Emails are flooding in saying, where are the video
[3:05:58.240 --> 3:06:04.640]  streams? And I've been asking that question. We've got some backup systems. We're firing up.
[3:06:04.640 --> 3:06:10.240]  The archive videos are at van.video. All the different archive videos of David Knight this
[3:06:10.240 --> 3:06:14.080]  morning, right back through the last couple of years, are there. We were taking off YouTube,
[3:06:14.080 --> 3:06:20.320]  taking off Facebook, taking off Twitter. But you can go find all those. It's the live streams that
[3:06:20.320 --> 3:06:25.760]  are down. And we're working to get those back up for you. But I mean, we could get swat teamed
[3:06:25.760 --> 3:06:29.200]  any minute in my head blown off and we won't be to show it anymore then. I mean, that's where
[3:06:29.200 --> 3:06:32.720]  this country is going. People don't get pissed and wake up and take action. It probably is a
[3:06:32.720 --> 3:06:36.240]  fifth column. You know, I've been one of these big companies doing it. They admit they do it.
[3:06:36.240 --> 3:06:40.800]  This is the sabotage. They're shutting everyone that's pro America down. The country is under attack.
[3:06:42.960 --> 3:06:47.680]  Well, communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy
[3:06:47.680 --> 3:06:54.560]  used by half. And the United States wouldn't sign on to it. So guess what happened along came COVID-19
[3:06:54.560 --> 3:07:00.160]  and Bill Gates celebrating saying it's already cut your carbon footprint by half. And that means
[3:07:00.160 --> 3:07:05.280]  you're going to be poor now and under his control. And of course, with the medical tyranny comes the
[3:07:05.280 --> 3:07:12.240]  force inoculations, a microchip that comes with the vaccine and so much more. And Bill Gates admits
[3:07:12.240 --> 3:07:18.640]  that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it. So remember, folks, they're coming to hurt you and
[3:07:18.640 --> 3:07:23.440]  your family and destroy your basic rights. The same left that says to kill babies all day long.
[3:07:23.440 --> 3:07:28.880]  Women own their bodies. Now say you don't own your body and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you.
[3:07:28.880 --> 3:07:33.840]  If you don't submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home. Mark the beast. Oh, and guess what?
[3:07:33.840 --> 3:07:38.160]  Jeffrey Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates under a bunch of dirty
[3:07:38.160 --> 3:07:43.840]  devil worshipers in your face. They hate you and your family. Hiding in plain view, Politico,
[3:07:43.840 --> 3:07:49.600]  the Associated Press, you name it, admit that a half a billion people, extra 500 million,
[3:07:49.600 --> 3:07:55.120]  are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions already starving
[3:07:55.120 --> 3:08:00.160]  because of the global lockdown. That is hundreds of times worse than all the death of the world
[3:08:00.160 --> 3:08:05.120]  caused by COVID-19 and the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the chai comms at the World
[3:08:05.120 --> 3:08:10.640]  Health Organization with Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down
[3:08:10.640 --> 3:08:15.440]  society, create a depression and forcibly inoculate everybody. This is insane. Ladies and gentlemen,
[3:08:15.440 --> 3:08:19.680]  if they succeed, it's over. You need to get prepared now. You need to get high quality
[3:08:19.680 --> 3:08:25.280]  storeable food now back in stock at infowarstore.com and you need to get politically active and
[3:08:25.280 --> 3:08:30.080]  challenge this verbally everywhere. Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully
[3:08:30.080 --> 3:08:35.680]  people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing. This is beyond 1984.
[3:08:35.680 --> 3:08:40.240]  The tyranny of the dual orders here. Get prepared now and spread the word in the info war. You are
[3:08:40.240 --> 3:09:05.200]  the paul reveres. You're listening to the alex jones show you're listening to
[3:09:05.200 --> 3:09:11.200]  the alex jones show and now your host gerald solante
[3:09:14.560 --> 3:09:21.680]  hello hello great being on the alex jones show and that's that cover they just showed of our
[3:09:21.680 --> 3:09:29.920]  transjournal dumb enough to believe bushes wars and dumb enough to believe the covid war
[3:09:29.920 --> 3:09:38.480]  this town and we did that last week and just two days ago this came out
[3:09:39.440 --> 3:09:46.240]  george w bush we are not potters partisan combatants in fight against coronavirus
[3:09:47.040 --> 3:09:51.440]  bushes comments come as democratic governors class or republican president donald trump
[3:09:51.440 --> 3:10:00.000]  oh the white house coronavirus response they're quoting this moron this murderous low life and
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:08.320]  when you look at it this great artwork by anthony frida you got george w bush looking like um
[3:10:08.320 --> 3:10:14.080]  alfredy newman from mad magazine the stupid little freak that he is
[3:10:14.080 --> 3:10:23.200]  is quote let us remember how small our differences are in the face of this shared threat or said
[3:10:23.920 --> 3:10:32.560]  in the final analysis we are not partisan combatants we are human beings equally vulnerable
[3:10:32.560 --> 3:10:42.000]  and equally wonderful in the sight of god which rise or fall together human beings man
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:52.000]  and you're the farthest thing from a human being again frida nailed it you are a lousy freaking
[3:10:52.640 --> 3:10:57.120]  murderous criminal and when you talk about
[3:11:00.560 --> 3:11:05.840]  we're equally vulnerable and equally wonderful in the sight of god
[3:11:05.840 --> 3:11:19.760]  your god is sainton you're a murderer you're a low life murdering piece of garbage that should
[3:11:19.760 --> 3:11:26.880]  be brought up on a war triumph cry butyl for lying us into war with all the rest of the low
[3:11:26.880 --> 3:11:34.800]  lives around you that little arrogant nobody boy donald rumsfeld yeah mission accomplished

[3:12:25.680 --> 3:12:33.680]  right word in them but it starts with an s look at these little low-life pieces of crap and you

[3:13:03.520 --> 3:13:07.920]  war i couldn't imagine myself i'm watching all these pictures guys walking up to water this deep
[3:13:07.920 --> 3:13:15.680]  with guns over their head well let's wait on their back and getting shot at so i said i can't do that
[3:13:15.680 --> 3:13:25.600]  i i voted for richard next i mentioned this because his alex jones was talking earlier
[3:13:26.320 --> 3:13:34.160]  and commercial there about how the media got us into this war covet war and i detail this
[3:13:34.160 --> 3:13:43.280]  in the trends journal as it happened our january 28th issue 106 die in china and our line was
[3:13:43.280 --> 3:13:47.600]  1.4 billion still alive what are you telling me this for
[3:13:51.360 --> 3:14:02.560]  so last week april 28th we could go tuesday u.s coronavirus cases surpassed 1 million
[3:14:02.560 --> 3:14:09.280]  and death toll is greater than u.s losses in vietnam that's from the cartoon news network
[3:14:09.280 --> 3:14:15.440]  you know the home of the little boys of nothing like little baby anderson cooper
[3:14:16.160 --> 3:14:22.080]  yeah gloria vander van der bil's little boy another guy born on third base and thought he had
[3:14:22.080 --> 3:14:29.040]  home run an arrogant little nobody hey remember when he got beat up in the arab spring in egypt
[3:14:29.040 --> 3:14:36.800]  and they rushed him home oh somebody punched me and how about that other boy yeah that little
[3:14:36.800 --> 3:14:42.560]  christie qualmo another boy born on third base thought he had a home run oh i'm sick i can't
[3:14:42.560 --> 3:14:53.360]  do it don't take a coronavirus i can't even die the reason he didn't die is because
[3:14:55.840 --> 3:15:00.800]  coronavirus diabetes lung and heart disease common in u.s coronavirus patients
[3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:07.760]  but that's only according to the census of disease control ground zero the fifth of all
[3:15:07.760 --> 3:15:16.080]  chronic deaths have been in nursing homes one after another going back to vietnam and talking
[3:15:16.080 --> 3:15:24.720]  about the low lives i mentioned this low life qualmo planes i'm gonna die i'm gonna die and cnn
[3:15:24.720 --> 3:15:38.880]  and cnn comparing the coveted to vietnam that is disgustingly sick united states killed over
[3:15:38.880 --> 3:15:50.320]  three million people in vietnam the agent orange cambodia laos vietnam poisoned millions more
[3:15:50.320 --> 3:15:56.560]  could need to see food the food the morons the imbeciles yeah we'll get rid of all the crops
[3:15:56.560 --> 3:16:03.040]  over there they'll have no trees nothing to eat we'll be able to bomb them that's what cnn is
[3:16:03.040 --> 3:16:10.320]  comparing this to they're forgetting the 300 000 u.s young guys like i was
[3:16:10.320 --> 3:16:21.840]  guys like i was that came went over there and came back seriously wounded and the other one
[3:16:21.840 --> 3:16:30.000]  suffering from illnesses post traumatic stress syndrome of murdering innocent people
[3:16:30.000 --> 3:16:38.160]  um that's cnn oh and those little low life pieces of garbage
[3:16:39.200 --> 3:16:42.640]  prostitutes who get paid to put out
[3:16:45.120 --> 3:16:48.640]  they forgot to mention the golf of tonkin incident was another lie
[3:16:49.760 --> 3:16:55.680]  just like the george w bush lie it never happened the way they said it did
[3:16:55.680 --> 3:17:07.520]  that's cnn that's how they're selling this coveted war and guess what just as the people
[3:17:07.520 --> 3:17:13.520]  were dumb enough and i was one of them to buy the vietnam war just like the people were dumb
[3:17:13.520 --> 3:17:23.920]  enough to buy george w bush's war they're dumb enough to be buying the coveted war i see people
[3:17:23.920 --> 3:17:32.160]  driving with their windows up and masks on grow them grow up i can't use the word i'd like to use
[3:17:34.320 --> 3:17:37.760]  children of all ages we'll be right back
[3:17:41.600 --> 3:17:48.400]  now that this u n global government shycom billable indicates medical tyranny has seen how far they
[3:17:48.400 --> 3:17:55.840]  can push it now we just lapped it up like like poison you know now they're gonna launch more
[3:17:55.840 --> 3:18:02.880]  bio attacks that are even more hardcore this early one does kill people but see it's a virus
[3:18:02.880 --> 3:18:08.880]  billable indicates own it's a virus that that's novel from others so they can give you a vaccine
[3:18:08.880 --> 3:18:13.120]  you see a regular cold or flu virus you really can't do a vaccine for because it's always
[3:18:13.120 --> 3:18:20.800]  mutated but see because this is a chimera and lab made they can have a speciality so it's a whole
[3:18:20.800 --> 3:18:25.520]  giant franchise they can filter the rich off of it they can just surveil everybody everybody
[3:18:25.520 --> 3:18:29.360]  gets to become a suspect and now when you would have low numbers of death it doesn't matter because
[3:18:29.360 --> 3:18:35.360]  they make a huge spectacle out of it you watch next year with the flu it'll even be bigger as well
[3:18:35.920 --> 3:18:38.720]  this is what they've done to us because we're a bunch of domesticated idiots
[3:18:38.720 --> 3:18:45.120]  it's time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic needs the alexa pure
[3:18:45.120 --> 3:18:49.680]  pro water filtration system is the same water filter that alexa the info wars crew use every

[3:23:31.760 --> 3:23:40.320]  he comes down to comes up to kingston to visit a couple of times a year we used to go to this
[3:23:40.320 --> 3:23:51.200]  great french restaurant lacuna and he said if i go into a store and the owner of the store says
[3:23:51.200 --> 3:24:00.400]  to put on a mask it's his store and do what he says but for these governors to be making up these
[3:24:00.400 --> 3:24:07.520]  laws saying you have to do this and then the legislature is passing them this is unconstitutional
[3:24:09.920 --> 3:24:15.520]  they're robbing us of our rights in order to keep our freedom alive that's what i'm mentioning
[3:24:16.160 --> 3:24:23.680]  to support info wars because they want to close us down
[3:24:23.680 --> 3:24:29.760]  they'll do anything they can to stop the truth as you well know
[3:24:31.200 --> 3:24:35.040]  ban facebook banning people saying to go out and protest

[3:25:23.760 --> 3:25:26.000]  so going on to what's going on
[3:25:29.760 --> 3:25:39.680]  again who's dying from the covid disease ap associated press keeps putting out these stories
[3:25:39.680 --> 3:25:47.360]  and in the stories they mentioned this from last week but it keeps going on with staff wearing
[3:25:47.360 --> 3:25:52.640]  masks checking customers temperatures and using disposable paper placements some of the nation's
[3:25:52.640 --> 3:25:57.120]  restaurants reopen blah blah blah blah blah blah and then they go in right down near the end
[3:25:57.840 --> 3:26:05.280]  and the story you see i printed it out the yellow i underlined salient points of stories
[3:26:05.280 --> 3:26:10.960]  because that's what i do i underline as i read that makes me help helps me remember
[3:26:12.160 --> 3:26:18.640]  they say at the end of the story for most people the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms
[3:26:19.520 --> 3:26:28.320]  for some it can cause severe illness such as pneumonia or even death all right
[3:26:28.320 --> 3:26:40.480]  for most people diabetes lung and heart disease common in us coronavirus patients
[3:26:42.160 --> 3:26:50.320]  centers for disease control world health organization saying the same thing
[3:26:50.320 --> 3:26:56.880]  on a different level most of the people that are dying are from nursing homes
[3:26:58.960 --> 3:27:00.000]  facts are all there
[3:27:04.800 --> 3:27:08.960]  also ignored in the mainstream this is from the transjournal going on tomorrow
[3:27:10.880 --> 3:27:17.600]  as fact by me is on on 23 april the european regional director of the world health organization
[3:27:17.600 --> 3:27:26.240]  dr hans klug revealed that over a half of covet deaths in europe have taken place in nursing homes
[3:27:26.880 --> 3:27:28.400]  and long-care facilities
[3:27:33.040 --> 3:27:39.840]  facts also clearly show that children and young demographics are less vulnerable to covet 19
[3:27:39.840 --> 3:27:51.360]  according to cdc data in us only 1.7 percent of nearly 150 000 infections were found in people
[3:27:51.360 --> 3:28:04.240]  under 18 years of age the people that are dying are again the elderly
[3:28:04.240 --> 3:28:14.640]  the obese of which 42 percent of americans are people suffering from heart disease
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:21.680]  pulmonary conditions and other chronic illnesses
[3:28:21.680 --> 3:28:35.600]  do you shut down an entire world for that the reason they have a higher death rate for example
[3:28:35.600 --> 3:28:46.480]  in italy the lombard region lombardy where most of them died is very polluted and italy has been
[3:28:46.480 --> 3:28:53.680]  in a recession climate haven't recovered from the 2008 panic she have a lot of people living with
[3:28:53.680 --> 3:29:03.280]  their parents and it's the elderly that are ill that are dying but yet they're spreading fear among
[3:29:03.280 --> 3:29:13.920]  all of us and now they've come out with a new normal this is abnormal it's the new abnormal
[3:29:13.920 --> 3:29:23.600]  welcome to it wearing masks stories on how in the airlines they're going to force you

[3:40:06.480 --> 3:40:17.280]  this is a tragedy of proportions
