[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  Another world, another time, another time, in the age of wonder, in the age of wonder.
[00:15.000 --> 00:28.000]  Another world, another time, slaps green and good until the truth is fact.
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:33.000 --> 00:41.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:41.000 --> 00:47.000]  We are live, we have launched another global transmission for the next four hours here today.
[00:47.000 --> 00:53.000]  Michael Savage was going to be on for an hour, but he had to reschedule, he's on next Wednesday, I believe.
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.000]  I'm going to get Paul Watson on to talk about an article up on infowars.com with video, with a bunch of other videos.
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.000]  And this is with Germans themselves clapping.
[01:03.000 --> 01:05.000]  The Green Party has said similar things.
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  A Muslim scholar celebrates extinction, quote, of blue-eyed, blonde-haired Germans.
[01:10.000 --> 01:22.000]  You see, this is an anti-white, anti-European agenda, and it's being done to just absolutely collapse the West.
[01:22.000 --> 01:28.000]  And they're bringing in the most incompatible people you can imagine.
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.000]  It is simply absolutely over the top.
[01:34.000 --> 01:41.000]  Political correctness gets you to turn off your own instincts, turn off your own life force, turn off your own common sense,
[01:41.000 --> 01:50.000]  and to make your new identity one of self-loathing and cultural suicide.
[01:50.000 --> 01:59.000]  And I have an entire spectrum of news along these lines today illustrating this that we're going to be breaking down.
[01:59.000 --> 02:12.000]  We have images of the Paris train station that looks like anywhere else in the world but Europe, and then a shot of the Russian train stations.
[02:12.000 --> 02:21.000]  Just to illustrate, can you imagine what people say in Nigeria or people in Brazil or people anywhere else would say if suddenly their country was like this
[02:21.000 --> 02:31.000]  and their country was offering, quote, all this free welfare to bring the third world populations there to then dip them into political correctness.
[02:31.000 --> 02:38.000]  This is Paris we're showing on screen for radio listeners, and then you cut to Moscow and it looks European.
[02:38.000 --> 02:46.000]  And this again would not be an issue if the groups being brought in were not being taught by the colleges and by the universities and by the schools
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.000]  and by the entire culture that you are here to destroy the culture.
[02:51.000 --> 02:59.000]  Folks used to want to come to the West to adopt some of the culture, the free market, the choices, the wealth, the technology.
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  But the globalists want to get rid of that and only have it on controlled government and corporate reservations.
[03:05.000 --> 03:11.000]  Everyone else without is in a giant gulag, basically.
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.000]  A giant ghetto, like what the Nazis did in Poland and other areas, putting their political enemies in these compact cities.
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.000]  That is the admitted plan.
[03:23.000 --> 03:32.000]  Meanwhile, there's a big story out in the UK Express, 80% of Brits would be happy to quit the UK for Russia after Putin offers free land.
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  Almost 8 out of 10 citizens would seriously consider quitting Britain and immigrating to Russia.
[03:37.000 --> 03:43.000]  A poll by Express has revealed. Now let's stop right there.
[03:43.000 --> 03:48.000]  They called it an apocalypse. In fact, we've got to print the article from the National Staff, I forgot to cover it.
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  In the major papers in Italy that they have a 1.3% reproduction rate.
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  For every two adults, they have 1.3 children.
[03:57.000 --> 04:07.000]  And trendies will go, how does people have 1.3? It's in the aggregate, it's in the sum of hundreds of millions of people.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  Simon, hundreds of millions now in Italy.
[04:11.000 --> 04:22.000]  Because of the modern culture, the modern programming, turning off the life force, the subliminal messages, the taxes, the regulations, what the TV sells that having kids are horrible.
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.000]  And they're calling it an apocalypse. Italy faces a population implosion apocalypse.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  And Italy is doubling tax rebates for you to have kids.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  So is Russia.
[04:34.000 --> 04:41.000]  But it's only Italy and Russia that aren't trying to commit suicide. They're dead already.
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  But they just realize their dad are trying to flop around in pools of societal blood and try to get up on their knees.
[04:47.000 --> 05:00.000]  Now in Germany, the UK and other areas, the political class has the bleeding culture on the ground, ramming double-edged daggers thousands of times, foaming at the mouth with trendies, helping pull the dagger in.
[05:00.000 --> 05:07.000]  We have another in a long list of fake hate crimes, this time being reported by KVU News in Austin.
[05:07.000 --> 05:17.000]  The man who said an employee at Whole Foods wrote a homophobic slur on a cake as withdrawn his lawsuit and now says that the company, quote, did nothing wrong.
[05:17.000 --> 05:21.000]  Jordan Brown made the initial allegations more than three weeks ago.
[05:21.000 --> 05:28.000]  He said at the time that he ordered a cake with the phrase love wins on it, but instead got a cake with a homophobic slur.
[05:28.000 --> 05:35.000]  Whole Foods has now dropped their countersuit after, quote, the truth has come to light in, quote, according to a statement from the company.
[05:35.000 --> 05:42.000]  Brown said in a statement Monday morning that he was wrong to pursue the matter and use the media to perpetrate the story.
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  He went on to apologize to Whole Foods and its team members for questioning their commitment to values.
[05:47.000 --> 05:53.000]  Brown's apology came after Whole Foods released a video debunking Brown's story.
[05:53.000 --> 06:06.000]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[06:23.000 --> 06:30.000]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[06:30.000 --> 06:43.000]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[06:45.000 --> 06:51.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[06:51.000 --> 07:01.000]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 Today at infowarslife.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[07:05.000 --> 07:13.000]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[07:13.000 --> 07:21.000]  Many years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.000]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[07:35.000 --> 07:44.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[07:44.000 --> 07:50.000]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[07:53.000 --> 07:59.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[07:59.000 --> 08:12.000]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[08:12.000 --> 08:18.000]  Thomas Jefferson. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:23.000 --> 08:28.000]  And we have kicked off another global broadcast. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you so much for joining us.
[08:28.000 --> 08:34.000]  Today is the 17th day of May, 2016. We'll be live here for the next four hours.
[08:34.000 --> 08:37.000]  We're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[08:37.000 --> 08:43.000]  We have David Knight on showing the fourth hour as well. I'll be here for the next three hours.
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  Alright, let me attempt this again right at the start. We've always failed, but today may be the day that I actually don't stop
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.000]  on the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, or, you know, 14th article.
[08:52.000 --> 08:59.000]  I'm told there might even be Las Vegas odds in the future. I'm being sarcastic on if I'll ever actually just run through the headlines.
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  But I think today's the day. Let's do it.
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.000]  Video. Muslim scholar celebrates extinction of blue-eyed, blonde-haired Germans.
[09:07.000 --> 09:16.000]  This is on infowars.com with a bunch of other government people agreeing and sharing that it's very, very wonderful and a good thing to do.
[09:16.000 --> 09:23.000]  80% of Brits would be happy to quit the UK for Russia after Putin offers free land. That's what the United States used to be,
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  but now it's all locked up and trying to take more land and sending special forces troops to kill you if you go protest.
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  Actually, usual. Regular army troops to kill you dead in a hammer.
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.000]  Out in good old Oregon. Italy set to double baby bonus to fight birthrate apocalypse.
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.000]  This all ties together. These three articles tie together. I'll get to those first once I've gone through the headlines.
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.000]  I think this is the day I'm actually going to go through at least 100 articles.
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  Hillary Clinton vows new gun grab in secret recording, which we have. It's up on infowars.com.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  We're going to be playing that for you here today.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  Secret gun grab.
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.000]  Soros management fund CNBC reports outlines new allocations goes bullish on gold.
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.000]  Yes, I personally myself have seen the elite artificially suppressed gold for a while.
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.000]  I've been saying for about six months, I thought it would go up. It's up like 200 something bucks.
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  I believe that will continue for a while.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  They can suppress it maybe again, but long term folks, paper is a fraud.
[10:16.000 --> 10:19.000]  Let's go ahead and go to the next article.
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  Formal Googlers launch a new startup to make trucks driverless.
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.000]  Oh, how wonderful. Hillary Clinton keeps losing. So how come she's winning?
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.000]  LA Times asked the obvious question.
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  They go through a whole debate here that if the delegates don't buy her act that they're supposed to go with her,
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.000]  even though they belong to Sanders, he will be the nominee.
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.000]  I don't like Sanders, but I'm telling you, he's less establishment than Hillary.
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  I would prefer him over Hillary, by frankly.
[10:47.000 --> 10:54.000]  But at the same time, it just illustrates how the system is completely and totally a fraud.
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  But Trump was smart and got up and pointed out that it was a fraud with the Republicans doing it.
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.000]  They played a con game, a confidence game, acted like it was totally normal.
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.000]  Then it blew up in their face. They had to back off at least for now.
[11:07.000 --> 11:09.000]  They tried to develop a third party run.
[11:09.000 --> 11:16.000]  They admit to scuttle the Republican Party and ensure Hillary gets in power.
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.000]  Another report, no-go areas, huge increase in attacks on police in Sweden.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  Now mainstream news is having to admit giant no-go areas all over Europe.
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  Our reporters have experienced it.
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.000]  We've shown videos from the UK to Germany, the Sweden to France.
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.000]  When they have national parade days just with flags, the radical jihadis on welfare,
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  oil, arrogant, just run out and attack everyone.
[11:39.000 --> 11:42.000]  The police stand down and worship the foreigners attacking,
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  because they're setting all this up for the total fall.
[11:45.000 --> 11:53.000]  Globalists are in control of our countries and are bringing us down systematically right now.
[11:53.000 --> 11:57.000]  Oh, more long lines, this time at Atlanta for multiple hours.
[11:57.000 --> 12:03.000]  WBSTV reports, just training everybody that the TSA needs more funding.
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.000]  It's how you hold folks hostage. Good job federal government hijacking our transportation.
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  Murder rates in Chicago, LA, Dallas and Vegas skyrocket because the economy is imploding.
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  These are all in big city areas where the general population is not armed, of course.
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  Chicago had the highest crime rate in the world two years ago.
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  It's doubled since then to double its previous record.
[12:25.000 --> 12:32.000]  These are places run by the mafia, run by the Clintons and the Obamas and others.
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  Hillary Clinton says her husband will fix the economy.
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  That's right, Bill Clinton planted the seeds of economic destruction.
[12:40.000 --> 12:45.000]  We're going to be talking about the real economic record of these people.
[12:45.000 --> 12:53.000]  Princeton professor, there are few superstitions that are more absurd than transgenderism,
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  saying that it's basically complete mental illness.
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  12 signs that a cloud of insanity has descended on the land. I want to go through these 12 signs
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  because it's a good article by Michael Snyder, but I want to just point out there's stuff a lot crazier than this.
[13:07.000 --> 13:13.000]  So I've got a list of about 100. I'm really going to attempt to go through this today.
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.000]  Study, go to church, live longer, CBS Philly.
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  Another scientific study shows what all the other studies show absolutely increases your lifespan.
[13:22.000 --> 13:29.000]  Just like the Bible says, follow the Lord thy God's commandments and he will be given at least 75 years
[13:29.000 --> 13:37.000]  and maybe another 25 on top of it. Go read Leviticus for yourself.
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  Continuing here, I told you at the time this was totally fake because Whole Foods had come out and said it was fake.
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  And the baker that actually made the cake was, quote, gay.
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  I'm not going to use the word you say, not because I dislike you,
[13:49.000 --> 13:53.000]  but because now we can't use the word mother or father either because the media said so.
[13:53.000 --> 14:04.000]  So the baker was homosexual and he said that the pastor, wanting attention, said that they wrote fag on it.
[14:04.000 --> 14:09.000]  And I could look at the cake and see it was even done in another hand.
[14:09.000 --> 14:15.000]  Whoever had squeezed out the blue paste, we can probably put it on screen for TV viewers, had put it a little bit different font.
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  And I mean, why would someone put in a cake saying love wins and then this comes back?
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  It was a huge publicity stunt, just like most of these things are, a false flag.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  And guess what? The surveillance camera shows him getting it and it didn't say it.
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.000]  He went home and did it and now he's, quote, apologized.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  But here's a big lesson in all this.
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  It's probably changed our headline too.
[14:34.000 --> 14:42.000]  Homosexual activists caught in false flag are caught staging a hate crime against himself.
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  Because this is all how we're diverted while all our basic liberties are taken.
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.000]  We're diverted off into who begs people's cakes while all of our freedoms are stolen.
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  We're signed on to giant debts.
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  Oh my gosh, there's a succession with bakeries.
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  But here's the big issue.
[14:58.000 --> 15:06.000]  Look at this article out of the Austin, American statesmen also have one out of KVUE TV and they all have the same headline.
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  Pastor to drop lawsuit against Whole Foods over anti-gay slur on cake.
[15:10.000 --> 15:17.000]  It should be pastor caught lying in hoax for attention.
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.000]  Almost every time a swastika gets put on a dorm or a cross is burned in the yard,
[15:22.000 --> 15:28.000]  or the lacrosse team supposedly rapes the black woman, 99% of the time it comes out it's fake.
[15:28.000 --> 15:35.000]  I mean, I'm telling you, when is it real? When is it real? When is it real? When is it real?
[15:35.000 --> 15:46.000]  It was real when three white supremacist convicts pulled over and killed a homeless former black convict that they knew
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  and drugged him behind their car till his head came off.
[15:48.000 --> 15:55.000]  Then a couple years later on the same stretch of road, a white homeless person was drugged to death
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.000]  and there was one article and no coverage.
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.000]  Again, I don't know about control here, folks, just media control.
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.000]  They will not tell you this guy staged it to the last paragraph and says Whole Foods has video
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.000]  and that they believe he did it himself and that they're suing him.
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.000]  He says, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done this, but he doesn't admit to it.
[16:15.000 --> 16:19.000]  And the media lets him get away with it.
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.000]  I think it's wrong to drag a red-haired man down the road, a black-haired man down the road,
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  a purple person down the road.
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  The point is though, it's how the media reports this stuff.
[16:30.000 --> 16:35.000]  Again, there are a lot of problems with the police, massive corruption in many areas,
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  part of the corrupt overall system.
[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  But statistically, police kill around 1,000 to 1,100 people a year
[16:42.000 --> 16:47.000]  and in the feds on investigations, they say around 100 to 150 every year are questionable.
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  Let's say that's a whitewash. Let's say 400 are questionable.
[16:51.000 --> 16:54.000]  No, let's say 500 are questionable. Let's say 550.
[16:54.000 --> 17:01.000]  Half of them are bad shootings, which I don't believe they are.
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  More cops than that get shot here.
[17:03.000 --> 17:06.000]  But you don't know any of the cops' names that ever got shot, do you?
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  But you know the name of every other person in the inner city that got shot
[17:09.000 --> 17:16.000]  because it's the media hyping it into racial division.
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.000]  And then the feds are coming into federalize the police to supposedly fix that problem.
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.000]  I'm sorry, the numbers don't add up.
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.000]  Do I like cops out there revenue generating instead of stopping criminals?
[17:26.000 --> 17:27.000]  Absolutely not.
[17:27.000 --> 17:31.000]  And that's the government directing the police departments to do that.
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  And so it's like I'm mad at the TSA for the stuff they do, but the Congress does it
[17:35.000 --> 17:39.000]  and the parties do it while they leave the border open and ship in the illegals
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  saying I've got to have my genitals groped.
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  The problem is Congress and the problem is our state's not stopping it.
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.000]  But when Texas passed a law, passed it in the House
[17:48.000 --> 17:54.000]  and was about to pass the Senate unanimously in the House to not let them grop children at the airport,
[17:54.000 --> 17:58.000]  Obama five years ago threatened air blockades with F-16s.
[17:58.000 --> 18:03.000]  It was almost Civil War again.
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.000]  See, think about that.
[18:04.000 --> 18:07.000]  See, all of our rights are being destroyed by multinationals that have come in
[18:07.000 --> 18:11.000]  and taken this country over just like they did China 200 years ago
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  or African countries or you name it.
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  We're being colonized by multinational corporations who want us poor
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.000]  and want to drive down wages and don't want prosperity,
[18:21.000 --> 18:22.000]  who are cold-blooded.
[18:22.000 --> 18:23.000]  They're not free marketers.
[18:23.000 --> 18:24.000]  They're monopoly men.
[18:24.000 --> 18:25.000]  There are mortal enemies.
[18:25.000 --> 18:31.000]  They exempt themselves from the taxes and regulations they put on us.
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.000]  And we're too busy for two years here in the lacrosse team right to Blackstripper
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.000]  and it turned out the whole thing was fake because she wanted attention.
[18:39.000 --> 18:40.000]  And you know what?
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.000]  People do that because they know they'll get attention.
[18:45.000 --> 18:51.000]  And they'll get lawsuits and people get money because the media plays along with this.
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.000]  To divide and conquer our nation and tens of millions of lawyers
[18:55.000 --> 18:58.000]  shooing everyone for everything as the economy collapses,
[18:58.000 --> 19:04.000]  you can't do business in this country anymore.
[19:04.000 --> 19:07.000]  Swimming pools are now two feet deep because of lawsuits.
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  Diving boards were gone 20 years ago.
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  Dodgeball and tags been banned.
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  Soon it'll be football and baseball.
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  We're being totally captured in a scientific,
[19:15.000 --> 19:21.000]  anopticonic nanny state designed to kill normal human activity.
[19:21.000 --> 19:22.000]  And the metrics are all in.
[19:22.000 --> 19:23.000]  We're dumb.
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.000]  We're fat.
[19:24.000 --> 19:25.000]  We're stupid.
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.000]  We're lazy.
[19:26.000 --> 19:27.000]  We're jellyfish.
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.000]  The public walks around with giant fluoride goiters hanging by their necks.
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  You're under chemical attack.
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  Wake up to it.
[19:35.000 --> 19:40.000]  The problem is not 150 bad shootings a year.
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  You could execute that 150 cops every year.
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  It wouldn't do jack crap.
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  And I'm certainly not here saying I've got no problems with the police.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  The point is it's a red herring.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  Excuse me.
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  I'm trying to control myself.
[19:52.000 --> 19:53.000]  Okay.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  I got through like, I got through like 20 something stories.
[19:55.000 --> 19:56.000]  I got like a hundred more.
[19:56.000 --> 19:57.000]  Let me come back.
[19:57.000 --> 19:58.000]  I'm going through each one.
[19:58.000 --> 19:59.000]  Bam, bam, bam.
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  Then I'm going back into it.
[20:00.000 --> 20:01.000]  Hi.

[20:06.000 --> 20:09.000]  I'm here to tell you about something that just might save your lives.
[20:09.000 --> 20:14.000]  You never know when there will be another Katrina and economic collapse or a serious drought.

[20:18.000 --> 20:21.000]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that.
[20:21.000 --> 20:26.000]  A U.S. company named Harvest Right has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared.

[21:59.000 --> 22:03.000]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[22:03.000 --> 22:04.000]  It's true.
[22:04.000 --> 22:08.000]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.000]  But with a trusted big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[22:15.000 --> 22:28.000]  NSF, EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  Big Berkey water filters for the love of clean water.
[23:26.000 --> 23:32.000]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.000]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[23:36.000 --> 23:37.000]  I loved my dad.
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.000]  But boy was he stubborn.
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.000]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  His excuse?
[23:42.000 --> 23:43.000]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[23:45.000 --> 23:50.000]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[23:50.000 --> 23:51.000]  Don't wait.
[23:51.000 --> 23:54.000]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  For not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones.
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.000]  Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[24:13.000 --> 24:18.000]  Well, he got demonized by Len Beck.
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  He got demonized by Ted Cruz.
[24:22.000 --> 24:29.000]  I got demonized as well by those same individuals.
[24:29.000 --> 24:35.000]  Matt Drudge got attacked by the entire Republican establishment that he was a horrible person,
[24:35.000 --> 24:42.000]  that he was evil, that he was bad because he pointed out that in the primaries,
[24:42.000 --> 24:47.000]  Trump was winning, but they would then take the delegates in six different states
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  and give them the crews and make him win.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  And just say, oh, it's our rules.
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  We say so.
[24:54.000 --> 25:00.000]  Then they started just canceling the primaries and just having the superdelegates
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  unanimously give everything to Ted Cruz.
[25:02.000 --> 25:03.000]  And folks really got upset.
[25:03.000 --> 25:06.000]  And every day that that happened, Drudge would link to it.
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  Show it in FullWars.com.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  And just run the headline.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  She keeps losing.
[25:12.000 --> 25:13.000]  How come she's winning?
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  And that's an LA Times article.
[25:15.000 --> 25:16.000]  That's what Drudge would link to.
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.000]  He would link to the Denver Post, Associated Press, in FullWars.com,
[25:20.000 --> 25:25.000]  where we had headlines with our reporters on the ground saying they just canceled the election.
[25:25.000 --> 25:26.000]  It was common sense.
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.000]  It was wrong.
[25:27.000 --> 25:28.000]  They tried to say we were wrong.
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  We were cooks and they failed.
[25:30.000 --> 25:36.000]  And now Hillary is back in the news and they've got the head of the Federal Elections Commission
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.000]  talking about Drudge saying she's intimidated and got death threats
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.000]  because Drudge linked to an article about her saying that she'd like to shut the Drudge report down.
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.000]  Oh, the Daily Beast, the poor baby.
[25:47.000 --> 25:52.000]  He links to articles where they admit they're stealing the election from Bernie Sanders.
[25:52.000 --> 25:53.000]  It's a fact.
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  How could you not link to that?
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  They, she, he linked to articles and so did in FullWars.
[25:59.000 --> 26:05.000]  That said that Ted Cruz was having elections canceled and getting all the delegates.
[26:05.000 --> 26:12.000]  They try to act like we're freaks for common sense, but we're not.
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  So that's coming up in the next segment.
[26:14.000 --> 26:25.000]  And all Drudge does is show Fox News holding up a Drudge printout that says she keeps losing how come she is winning.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  And then of course Drudge mirrors the image again.
[26:27.000 --> 26:39.000]  And all Drudge is doing is saying the sky's blue, trees are green, grass is green, daisies are yellow, dogs bark, cats meow.
[26:39.000 --> 26:45.000]  Two plus two equals four and they just sit there going, you people are nuts.
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  And so Drudge is being demonized yet again, so are we.
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  It's in the news.
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.000]  We're being attacked for criticizing the fact that they're taking Bernie Sanders delegates.
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  People believe they're going to vote for Bernie Sanders and then it's just given to Hillary.
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  And then they want to go look at the radicals that are against it.
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  Matt Drudge and Alex Jones and others and they've got articles.
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.000]  I've got four different articles in my stack today with the Democratic Party going,
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.000]  we're afraid Sanders supporters are going to be violent.
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  They're bad evil people.
[27:12.000 --> 27:13.000]  See, they change the subject.
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  When Trump's saying you're stealing the election, they go, your people are violent.
[27:17.000 --> 27:22.000]  And then Ted Cruz came out and jumped the shark and said, oh yeah, the media's right.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  Donald Trump is violent.
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  His people are violent.
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  And that's why we're seeing these problems and he's a racist.
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.000]  All of it made up and people rejected it.
[27:33.000 --> 27:40.000]  So that's the really exciting news here is folks are rejecting this across the board
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  and we're having that moment of sanity and then look right up above it.
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.000]  FEC vice chair claims threats after she tried to regulate Drudge.
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.000]  Oh, she's got to get rid of free speech so she can take Drudge down or regulate it.
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.000]  She can do it to anybody.
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  See, a lot of idiots go, good, let him get Drudge.
[27:58.000 --> 27:59.000]  I'm jealous.
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  Oh boy, you're really stupid.
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  They're going to get you next dumb, dumb.
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  Like a lot of talk radio folks are like, I hope Rex Limbaugh had a heart attack in Hawaii a few years ago.
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.000]  I hope he dies or I hope he goes out of business or I hope they can boycott him.
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.000]  Oh, you're going to be next moron.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  They can take anybody's speech, including Michael Moore's.
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  None of us are safe.
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  I don't like Michael Moore, but I'll defend his free speech all day long, big time.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  Because if you don't hang together, you hang separate.
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  Oh, but the left loved Neshda Sousa getting arrested, they absolutely loved it.
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  And they love the persecution of conservative governors and attorney generals and all the arrests and all the harassment.
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.000]  It's fun.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  It's powerful to them.
[28:39.000 --> 28:46.000]  They're part of something big, even as their unemployment skyrockets and as Obamacare screws them over,
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.000]  they don't care.
[28:47.000 --> 28:53.000]  They want to feel like they're on the winning team, even if they're losers and fools.
[28:53.000 --> 29:04.000]  Homeland security has been alerted, it goes on to the evil of Drudge and Obama invites Ravel to the White House.
[29:04.000 --> 29:13.000]  And don't worry, Facebook's meeting with trusted Republican insiders, with Republican leaders like Bush's former spokesperson,
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  Perino and Glenn Beck, but no one else.
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.000]  Now, Trump complains, one of the representatives will be there going to Facebook saying,
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.000]  please don't censor us, please be nice to us.
[29:24.000 --> 29:30.000]  The fake conservatives are all lining up for the epic battle against the Republic with the forces of Mordor,
[29:30.000 --> 29:36.000]  represented by the Federal Elections Commission, Obama, Hillary and all the rest of them,
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.000]  as they openly try to steal elections, openly try to shut down the media,
[29:40.000 --> 29:44.000]  openly try to destroy the basic right of the First Amendment.
[29:44.000 --> 29:47.000]  I'm going to hit a bunch of other headlines and then plow back into this,
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  hit a bunch of clips straight ahead in FullWars.com.
[30:17.000 --> 30:23.000]  A research and development organization said Monday the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security
[30:23.000 --> 30:27.000]  had signed off on buying 100 units of its drone defender,
[30:27.000 --> 30:32.000]  billed as the safe solution for warding off intruding unmanned aerial vehicles.
[30:32.000 --> 30:37.000]  It's a portable solution to stop portable drones, said Rich Granger,
[30:37.000 --> 30:40.000]  a battle director for mission and defense technologies.
[30:40.000 --> 30:48.000]  The drone defender has two triggers, a command and control trigger to sever the link between the pilot and the UAV,
[30:48.000 --> 30:52.000]  and a second trigger to jam GPS links to the drone.
[30:52.000 --> 31:18.000]  To find more reports on Infowars.com.

[32:57.000 --> 33:18.000]  Check it out for yourself today.
[33:27.000 --> 33:47.000]  All right. I want to play a bunch of different election clips.
[33:47.000 --> 33:53.000]  I want to get back into the Federal Elections Commission.
[33:53.000 --> 33:59.000]  A bunch of their members, including the co-chairwoman, coming out and saying that they want to regulate the Internet.
[33:59.000 --> 34:09.000]  They want to regulate political speech and basically put election rules on it so they can arrest you and call it money.
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  If I say I don't want them to restrict guns, I don't want them to have an assault weapons ban,
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  and I'm on a couple hundred radio stations, they want to say that's political speech.
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  It's called my right of the First Amendment.
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  But see, they've got all their media, but no one watches it or listens to it.
[34:23.000 --> 34:28.000]  People just laugh at it. It has a 6% trust rate according to the Associated Press.
[34:28.000 --> 34:34.000]  And so they are dead in the water with us totally kicking their butts.
[34:34.000 --> 34:41.000]  And so they're just running around whining about Drudge Report and infowars and other sites.
[34:41.000 --> 34:44.000]  But mainly Drudge Report because that's the biggest one. That's the archetype.
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.000]  It's like when you use a search engine, you say Google it.
[34:48.000 --> 34:55.000]  The name of a search engine is now Google. The name of the free Internet is called Drudge.
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  I mean, it's really becoming that where if something's just nationalistic, free market,
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.000]  wide spectrum, shows you all the news, lets you make the decision,
[35:04.000 --> 35:13.000]  but has a bent towards freedom, a bias towards the truth, you call it Drudge.
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  Just populist conservatism, libertarianism, whatever you want to call it.
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  America.
[35:19.000 --> 35:26.000]  You know, Drudge will link to an article with horror admitting that there are thousands of chimera,
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.000]  part human, part animal creatures, living on farms across the U.S.
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  And the media will even make fun of Drudge if you know he links to MIT admitting it.
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  Because they didn't want that looked at.
[35:38.000 --> 35:44.000]  That was meant for academics to look at and to get ready for it, not for the public yet.
[35:44.000 --> 35:50.000]  Kind of like it was public and partially declassified 20 years ago that the NSA was spying via keywords
[35:50.000 --> 35:55.000]  and had giant spying hubs in every major telecommunications facility and was putting in even bigger control grids.
[35:55.000 --> 36:02.000]  And by federal law in 1996, all cell phones by 2000 had to have satellite GPS tracker systems
[36:02.000 --> 36:07.000]  and be able to be dialed into even when they're off and turn the microphone on.
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  That's in the congressional record. That's law.
[36:10.000 --> 36:17.000]  That's why I put out films 19, 20 years ago that say exactly what's being admitted today.
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.000]  Because it was on paper in law.
[36:22.000 --> 36:28.000]  You don't just think you get all the cell phone makers ubiquitously worldwide to make cell phones spying devices by accident.
[36:28.000 --> 36:34.000]  Or all cars now made worldwide for at least a decade have satellite tracker taxing boxes
[36:34.000 --> 36:40.000]  that you pay for in the cost of the car upwards of $1000 a piece.
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  You pay for it too. Ready to flip them on and start taxing you.
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.000]  And it's starting in Oregon. It's starting in the UK. It's starting in Germany.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  It's starting in Japan.
[36:51.000 --> 36:54.000]  Worldwide wired in to tax you.
[36:54.000 --> 36:59.000]  Oh, these boxes accidentally fell in all the cars. We're going to flip a switch and start taxing.
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[37:02.000 --> 37:09.000]  And the FEC runs around for two years putting out press releases saying we want to regulate drudge.
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.000]  We want to regulate talk radio. We want to regulate political speech.
[37:13.000 --> 37:19.000]  We are going to outlaw it. We're going to call it political and not let you do it unless it's approved by the FEC.
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.000]  And then you got to pay for your speech to the political class.
[37:24.000 --> 37:27.000]  Like, are you kidding you monster woman?
[37:27.000 --> 37:33.000]  And then people get upset by you wanting to butcher the First Amendment and you claim you got some death threats
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  as if her own agency wouldn't do it and hasn't been caught doing it.
[37:36.000 --> 37:42.000]  Just like I told you the guy putting fag on the cake in Austin, the preacher to get attention, the quote, gay preacher.
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  I said that's totally fake. Turned out the baker was gay.
[37:45.000 --> 37:52.000]  Turned out they had video of it saying what it originally said and he now basically admits he did it and says he's sorry.
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  His whole foods is suing him.
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  These people, they didn't even go in and target some conservative mom and pop that didn't have a surveillance camera.
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  They'll be smarter next time. Don't worry.
[38:01.000 --> 38:08.000]  They went and they targeted the big ultra liberal, you know, palace of ganas basically.
[38:08.000 --> 38:16.000]  You see these folks aren't even nice to their own people because it's all about the new economy as being a victim and suing someone.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  So he sued them. They sued back. He got caught.
[38:19.000 --> 38:24.000]  What dumb was he? Not knowing they got HD cameras all over that thing over every checkout line.
[38:24.000 --> 38:27.000]  What a, that's how dumb these people are.
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.000]  But you know who's dumber? The good American people of every race, color, creed, nationality.
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  Who, who, who, who put up with this?
[38:35.000 --> 38:45.000]  That put up with being conquered by a bunch of snot-nosed college students running around beating people up if they don't approve of your political message.
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.000]  And all over the country, the cops sit there at the university because they're leftist political officers, commasars.
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  And they, they agree on video that, yeah, yeah, we're going to shut your speech down.
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  No, these people are allowed to attack you.
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.000]  And everybody's like nodding to the weirdo cops, weird, weird, weird, you know, trendy cops.
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  I mean, this is one millimeter from round shirt stuff.
[39:04.000 --> 39:09.000]  They love it though because if you're a dumb, down person, all you've got is this fake identity.
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.000]  And all you've got is running around, stirring up trouble.
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.000]  I want to go through some more of the headlines and I'm going to go back into these clips that I've been mentioning.
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  And then I want to go over these key stories.
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  No-go areas, huge increase in attacks on police in Sweden.
[39:23.000 --> 39:31.000]  Video Muslim scholar celebrates extinction of blue-eyed blonde-haired Germans and is celebrated in the public forums by Germans who agree they need to die.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  The Green Party has said it's wonderful as well.
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  We have all the clips. We have a compilation clip as well.
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.000]  We have guys literally going, we are coming for you, women, weak Europeans.
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.000]  You will serve us as slaves. You women will wear the hijab.
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.000]  And the Germans are like, yes, I am in the crowd.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  I mean, you talk about sick.
[39:51.000 --> 39:57.000]  80% of Brits would be happy to quit the UK for Russia after Putin offers free land.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  That's what the United States used to do.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  Back when we were free, back when we at least had a free market.
[40:02.000 --> 40:08.000]  Italy set to double baby boom to fight birth rate apocalypse.
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  We have a picture of a morbid country.
[40:10.000 --> 40:16.000]  You bet you do. Liberal, trendy and dying.
[40:16.000 --> 40:23.000]  And then replaced by the most backward, poor, stone age, third world countries where all people do is murder and kill each other all day.
[40:23.000 --> 40:27.000]  And women are chained up inside slave pits with hoods over their heads.
[40:27.000 --> 40:33.000]  And then George Clooney comes up and says, how dare Trump hate women and Muslims?
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.000]  Oh, yes.
[40:36.000 --> 40:41.000]  Same guy, the one sure second minute that he has bodyguards, the hypocrites of the planet.
[40:41.000 --> 40:45.000]  But let's continue first with the headlines I haven't gotten to.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  There's only probably 100 more.
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.000]  Housed away 622 million in New Zika virus funding.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  When it's her own government helping cook it up and weaponize it.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  We've done special reports on that.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  Socialism's dismal harvest.
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.000]  Venezuela in addition as the country descends into total hell.
[41:02.000 --> 41:09.000]  West colleges and people like Sean Penn teach that it's the heaven on earth, a utopia.
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  Defense bill coming this week.
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  A boost for war and tyranny.
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.000]  British students demand LGBT only accommodation.
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  So that's what this means.
[41:17.000 --> 41:25.000]  Total Balkanization where all the quote immigrant groups, minority groups, religious groups, sexual groups want their own little areas now and you're going to pay for it.
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.000]  Self segregating the ultimate Balkanization in the name of diversity and unity.
[41:31.000 --> 41:38.000]  Panama papers, real George Soros, deep money ties to secretive weapons, Intel investment firm.
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  NDAA 2017 military industrial complex wins.
[41:42.000 --> 41:43.000]  People lose.
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  Ron Paul breaks that down video on infowars.com.
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  We got a bunch of other economic news I want to be getting to.
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.000]  But let's get into some of the political stacks that are really, really, really important here in a moment.
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  What's happening with that in these video and audio clips.
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.000]  First, I'm just going to straight shoot you right now.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  I've talked to so many people on the ground.
[42:05.000 --> 42:06.000]  You've heard them call in.
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.000]  You've read the reviews at third party sites that are linked to them for store.com.
[42:11.000 --> 42:17.000]  Where people had their lives changed by survival shield, Mason iodine, the purest form of iodine that you can actually absorb.
[42:17.000 --> 42:23.000]  The good halogen that's in there blocking the bad halogens, the chlorine, the bromide, the bromine, the fluoride, all of it.
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  That is such a game changer in and of itself.
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  It's incredible.
[42:27.000 --> 42:35.000]  What things like oxy powder does, things like DNA force, things like lung cleanse, things like super male vitality that's unfortunately sold out or anthroplex.
[42:35.000 --> 42:36.000]  It's excellent as well.
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  We still have that special 15% off running for only one more day.
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.000]  So these are things you absolutely owe yourself.
[42:43.000 --> 42:54.000]  And the reason it's a total win is you're funding this broadcast and your funding is essential for the reporters, the crew, the researchers and what we do here.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  And when it comes to the products we have, they're the best out there.
[42:59.000 --> 43:00.000]  We've done the research.
[43:00.000 --> 43:07.000]  We've gone to the top labs, the top companies and had them produce original private labeled products for us that are amazing.
[43:07.000 --> 43:15.000]  Some of our products like Childies and others are 25 year old nationwide best selling products, private labeled for us at a lower price than the original folks sell it.
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.000]  And it's just incredible.
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  Your kids should take it every day.
[43:19.000 --> 43:28.000]  It doesn't really calm them down other than the fact that it's got so many concentrated herbs in it that they just work so much better and are so much smarter in my experience.
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.000]  In 1995, a huge bottle, give them a teaspoon every day.
[43:32.000 --> 43:35.000]  It's great for adults as well.
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  Sign up for auto ship, get 10% off.
[43:37.000 --> 43:40.000]  Orders of $50 or more free shipping as well.
[43:40.000 --> 43:45.000]  M4WarsLife.com takes you right to the sub-session of the nutraceuticals.
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.000]  It's a four ounce bottle.
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.000]  A little teaspoon every day, simply amazing.
[43:51.000 --> 43:52.000]  Childies.
[43:52.000 --> 43:53.000]  I mean there's so many products.
[43:53.000 --> 44:07.000]  We've got the knockout that is nine different compounds like melatonin, L-tryptophan, Valerian root that are all the regular dose you buy in the same size caplets from leading competitors for the same price.
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  They just put filler in.
[44:09.000 --> 44:10.000]  We don't have any filler.
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.000]  It's nine different known things naturally to give you deep restful sleep.
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  People are just crazy about this.
[44:16.000 --> 44:22.000]  It's 1995, a bottle, a melatonin of the same dose on average is the same price.
[44:22.000 --> 44:38.000]  See, I don't believe in a system where you sit there and you just have a bunch of marketing and then you have something even more expensive because there's this perceived value and then folks pay more for crud because of the advertising and the hype.
[44:38.000 --> 44:46.000]  I just want to give you something at a very low price that is better than anything else out there on the market.
[44:46.000 --> 44:47.000]  I'm a big guy.
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  I take two to really sleep like the dead.
[44:49.000 --> 44:54.000]  One, if I've had too much coffee or whatever, will help.
[44:54.000 --> 44:57.000]  And you can talk to a doctor if you want to give it to your children.
[44:57.000 --> 44:58.000]  It's generally seen as safe.
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  But before you breathe air into your lungs, talk to your doctor.
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  Before you walk, talk to your doctor.
[45:02.000 --> 45:05.000]  Before you eat, you know, tomatoes, talk to your doctor.
[45:05.000 --> 45:15.000]  I just want to be just say that everybody, you know, talk to your doctor for you take any of these products because they're all what you call FDA grass is seen as the safe vitamins and minerals.
[45:15.000 --> 45:22.000]  But in this world today, it's important to always talk to your doctor because they tell you oxygen is bad.
[45:22.000 --> 45:25.000]  You should put a bag over your head and tie it up and die because that's what they said.
[45:25.000 --> 45:26.000]  Okay, it makes our casting.
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  The truth is just do your own research.
[45:28.000 --> 45:29.000]  Talk to your doctor.
[45:29.000 --> 45:30.000]  Check it out.
[45:30.000 --> 45:46.000]  Check it out.
[45:46.000 --> 45:47.000]  Read the label for yourself.
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.000]  It's concentrated.
[45:49.000 --> 45:50.000]  It's amazing.
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  Infowarslife.com.
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  Your purchase funds the operation.
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.000]  It makes everything we do here absolutely possible.
[45:57.000 --> 46:01.000]  We also have a really high quality spectrum of horrible foods from my patron supply.
[46:01.000 --> 46:06.000]  Our private labeled info or select specials are over, but they're already discounted.
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  Regardless, so check that out.
[46:08.000 --> 46:09.000]  The whole things that are happening.
[46:09.000 --> 46:10.000]  We need to be self sufficient.
[46:10.000 --> 46:11.000]  The summer's coming.
[46:11.000 --> 46:12.000]  The fall's coming.
[46:12.000 --> 46:25.000]  We have the best selection of really high quality, lowest price you're going to find big, big, probably the biggest selection out there of non GMO, heirloom, open pollinated seeds from fruit trees down to potatoes to tobacco.
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  You name it, we've got it.
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.000]  The full spectrum info or store.com.
[46:31.000 --> 46:41.000]  So get prepared and fund the tip of the spear on the info or this is really the total win-win because you're funding the fight against the globalist, the information war, the true voice of America.
[46:41.000 --> 46:42.000]  That's really what we are.
[46:42.000 --> 46:49.000]  The true voice of Renaissance, the true voice of freedom and this platform that is just having huge enroads across the board.
[46:49.000 --> 46:53.000]  Probably second only to something like dredge report.
[46:53.000 --> 47:01.000]  And with all of that, you are then getting the products you need to be prepared and to have a good, healthy life.
[47:01.000 --> 47:02.000]  It's amazing.
[47:02.000 --> 47:08.000]  That's what I've set out to do and everything I'm engaged in because I'm a symbiotic person.
[47:08.000 --> 47:17.000]  I'm a win-win person down to my core and I'm going to thank you all for your support, but also your prayers and also the fact that you defend us out there from the enemy and that you spread the word about the broadcast.
[47:17.000 --> 47:18.000]  I want to salute you.
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  All right.
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  I want to get into the election.
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.000]  Before a few of these headlines, I'm going to start playing some of these amazing clips.
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.000]  Nancy Pelosi, I guarantee Trump will not be president.
[47:28.000 --> 47:33.000]  California Democrat says New York billionaire, they hear today, gone to Mara Canada.
[47:33.000 --> 47:34.000]  Total arrogance.
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.000]  We've been hearing that for over a year.
[47:37.000 --> 47:43.000]  Former Trump girlfriend hits back at upsetting New York Times cover story that misquoted her, saying that once he said she was fat.
[47:43.000 --> 47:44.000]  I mean, that's all they got on him.
[47:44.000 --> 47:45.000]  My goodness.
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.000]  Majority of Republican voters trust Trump over Ryan to lead party NBC News.
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  Of course they do.
[47:52.000 --> 47:53.000]  Flashback.
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  Bill Clinton talks like Trump on immigration.
[47:55.000 --> 47:56.000]  We are a nation of laws.
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  We're going to play that clip.
[47:58.000 --> 47:59.000]  Hillary Clinton keeps losing.
[47:59.000 --> 48:00.000]  So why?
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  So how come she's winning?
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  LA Times asked the question.
[48:04.000 --> 48:05.000]  It's okay.
[48:05.000 --> 48:06.000]  Drudge asked it.
[48:06.000 --> 48:07.000]  He's evil.
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  The federal election commission says this is electioneering.
[48:10.000 --> 48:16.000]  They want to shut him down right now and then go, we've gotten death threats implying he did it.
[48:16.000 --> 48:22.000]  I hear this all the time on MSNBCC and they go, Alex Jones's fans have been known to threaten people.
[48:22.000 --> 48:25.000]  Oh, like the anti-Trump folks beating everybody up?
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  Trying to run cars over people?
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.000]  It's just crazy.
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.000]  We're all known to be nonviolent, but they imply we're violent.
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.000]  A small group of superdelegates could close the deal for Hillary.
[48:35.000 --> 48:36.000]  Bloomberg.
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  Oh, just selling an idea for folks.
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.000]  And remember, it's the New York Times and all of their publications calling for the assassination of Trump and that's okay.
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.000]  And all the people online, there's still a Facebook calling for the assassination of Trump.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  Now, one guy got on there and says he's going to kill his family.
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.000]  So the Secret Service did go arrest him.
[48:52.000 --> 48:53.000]  Good.
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  You got free speech, but you don't get to call for death.
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.000]  Nevada Democrats warn of DNC of violence from Sanders supporters.
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  You see, oh, roll call.
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  Oh, you know, they took the state in Nevada from him when he won it.
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.000]  So now they're complaining about the delegates going to Hillary.
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  So they're planning to protest and that's called violence.
[49:10.000 --> 49:16.000]  See, not being robbed, defending yourself if you're being mugged is violence.
[49:16.000 --> 49:24.000]  Upheaval in Nevada raises concerns over Democrat unity.
[49:24.000 --> 49:28.000]  Then it gets more disgusting and we know why Bernie isn't talking more about the steel.
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  Bernie's the early favorite for Hillary's running me.
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  Well, that's the worst possible combination.
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.000]  That dumb communist loon with that evil demon.
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.000]  Only Bernie supporters out there, so many of your listeners I've learned,
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  because you just don't like the establishment.
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  He's not going to tax the rich people.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  He's going to tax the middle class and give it to Warren Buffett and bank her bailouts.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  Okay, just, just, just get ready.
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  Want to live like Venezuela?
[49:51.000 --> 49:52.000]  Want to live like a slave?
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  Get ready.
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  I mean, Woodward and visions of the Washington Post,
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  Bill and Hillary's Chelsea on Mount Rushmore.
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  Boy, it's getting sicker by the minute.
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  And the Hill has a story.
[50:04.000 --> 50:05.000]  Hillary's unlikely ally, the media.
[50:05.000 --> 50:10.000]  Oh, it's so unlikely that they'd be the ally.
[50:10.000 --> 50:11.000]  We come back.
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  I'm going to hit that.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  And then I'm going to get into the stories.
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.000]  I'm actually playing a Nancy Pelosi says that Trump will not be president because she's Lord and savior.
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  I guess knows everything.
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  We've got Hillary Clinton vows of new gun grab.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  I want to play that first.
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.000]  It's audio recorded stealthily in a meeting.
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.000]  Bill Clinton is talking like Trump on immigration.
[50:32.000 --> 50:33.000]  We're going to get to that clip.
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  It's not Bill Clinton's job to run economy.
[50:36.000 --> 50:41.000]  We've got Hillary on Donald Trump has scary, dangerous talk of loose cannon.
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  So one of the starts all these wars.
[50:43.000 --> 50:48.000]  And I like to talk about not having war against Syria to put al-Qaeda in and not attacking Russia.
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  And I like to talk about being nice, but if you mess with us, we then defend ourselves.
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  That's an honorable, soft power way to be.
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.000]  Not a sniveling thug like Hillary.
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  Are you prepared to bug out infidel body armor?
[51:03.000 --> 51:10.000]  And an army Ranger have produced a high speed DVD and book to show you how to drive in combat patrol and how to survive in combat skills.

[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  Again and again.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  I'll take my chances on freedom again and again.
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  There's so much news.
[54:45.000 --> 54:51.000]  There is life after death. Scientists reveal shock findings from groundbreaking study.
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  And there's a bunch of other studies that back this up as well.
[54:53.000 --> 54:59.000]  They can actually pick up and read the consciousness and then at some point it leaves.
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.000]  Energy actually goes. Pretty powerful.
[55:03.000 --> 55:07.000]  We're going to be breaking that down. We're also going to be getting into that side of the express news.
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  We're going to be getting into magic mushrooms.
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  Lift severe depression in trial.
[55:11.000 --> 55:17.000]  That's been known forever by, well, the Romans and some of their apothecary.
[55:17.000 --> 55:22.000]  The Vikings took them whenever they would go into battle.
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.000]  But they're well known to a lot of people just in depression.
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  Sometimes for years. Kind of a chemical reset the brain.
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  Going to church could help you live longer.
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  Study finds CBS News. I'm going to get to that as well.
[55:35.000 --> 55:39.000]  Startup once said to put self-driving big rigs on highways.
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.000]  The rise of the robots. We better stand up for humans.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  This isn't innovation, folks.
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  This rollout of automation is to make us obsolete.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  The global submit.
[55:48.000 --> 55:49.000]  That's why we've got to block it.
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.000]  And start a movement where there's little human signs on things.
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.000]  Saying this was made by humans, farmed by humans, touched by human hands.
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  Humans were given work in this.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  Because they're not just going to let us, the globalists have said this in their white papers.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  Bill Joyce wrote about it and why the future doesn't need us.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  The decision was made more than 20 years ago.
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  Not to build a world where we just entertain ourselves in oil paint all day.
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  They're setting up robots and computers to take us out of the equation.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  To then exterminate most of us.
[56:15.000 --> 56:16.000]  And so we can't resist.
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.000]  We'll first be made totally domesticated, though.
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  It's really incredible.
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  I told you 20 years ago they'd still have cash, but it would just be digitally marked.
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.000]  Now they've announced that openly. I know the enemy.
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  I don't just research their own documents. I know the enemy.
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.000]  I connected the dots, folks. I know what I'm talking about, okay?
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  Please listen to me. Please listen to me.
[56:38.000 --> 56:45.000]  These are horrible people that fly around on giant jets filled with kidnapped children taking them to rape camps.
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  They hate you.
[56:47.000 --> 56:50.000]  And because you're not like them, you just can't imagine they're like that.
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.000]  They're more evil than I can imagine or you can imagine.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  Let's start playing clips.
[56:55.000 --> 57:00.000]  I'll give the number out and we'll take calls next hour, 800-25-99231.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  First-time callers in the first hour.
[57:02.000 --> 57:08.000]  I'll take calls next hour, 800-25-99231, 800-25-99231.
[57:08.000 --> 57:13.000]  Here's a short clip of Hillary in a secret speech to her minions, her ringwraiths,
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  that she will get those guns. Here it is.
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.000]  So I'm going to speak out. I'm going to do everything I can to rally people
[57:20.000 --> 57:25.000]  against this pernicious, corrupting influence of the NRA.
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  And we're going to do whatever we can.
[57:27.000 --> 57:31.000]  I was proud when my husband took them out and we were able to ban assault weapons,
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  but he had to put a sunset on.
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.000]  So 10 years later, of course, Bush wouldn't agree to reinstate them.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  We've got to go after this.
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  It paused. Back it up five seconds. Bush pushed the assault weapons ban.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  The Republican leadership tried to pass it.
[57:46.000 --> 57:51.000]  You're such an evil liar and you've got bodyguards and you have a will to dominate your slaves
[57:51.000 --> 57:54.000]  and you hate it. We're not completely your slaves yet.
[57:54.000 --> 57:57.000]  Even though you bankrupted this by design, you wicked monster
[57:57.000 --> 58:00.000]  that kept more than half the money from the Haitian children.
[58:00.000 --> 58:06.000]  You demonic pig that takes money from these blob sheiks that have women as slaves.
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  You are the worst person on earth, probably.
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  Let's go back. I'm not sure maybe Sorrel's going to be worse.
[58:10.000 --> 58:13.000]  Two peas in a pod. Let's finish up the clip.
[58:13.000 --> 58:17.000]  Of course, Bush wouldn't agree to reinstate them.
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  We've got to go after this.
[58:19.000 --> 58:23.000]  And here again, the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.
[58:23.000 --> 58:26.000]  And I am going to make that case every chance I get.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  So I will need your help on that.
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  That's right. She's going to stack the Supreme Court.
[58:30.000 --> 58:35.000]  And you know, people need to die in secret rituals and no autopsy is going to happen.
[58:35.000 --> 58:40.000]  No autopsy. Just first down. No autopsy. Nothing happened.
[58:40.000 --> 58:44.000]  Different stories. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[58:44.000 --> 58:45.000]  Second hour straight ahead.
[58:45.000 --> 58:48.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:51.000 --> 58:54.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[58:54.000 --> 58:57.000]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[58:57.000 --> 59:02.000]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[59:02.000 --> 59:08.000]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs,
[59:08.000 --> 59:11.000]  they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[59:11.000 --> 59:15.000]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[59:15.000 --> 59:18.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water,
[59:18.000 --> 59:21.000]  into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[59:21.000 --> 59:25.000]  turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[59:28.000 --> 59:34.000]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[59:34.000 --> 59:40.000]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[59:40.000 --> 59:43.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[59:43.000 --> 59:46.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands,
[59:46.000 --> 59:59.000]  and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  We are going to be going to your phone calls coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  The big story up on infowars.com is the same big story up on drudgereport.com.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  She keeps losing how come she is winning.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  Superdelegates are rebelling saying,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  look Hillary, it's okay.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  For the popular vote to count, that's what's supposed to happen.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  And you shouldn't be getting the delegates when you're losing these states,
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  and the media shouldn't keep calling you the winner.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  So the same thing that happened with Cruz trying to steal things from Trump
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  is they tried to give us that idea that that was okay, but the public didn't buy it.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  And so now they've gotten to the point where they're demonizing drudge
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  and they're having the head of the security of the Federal Election Commission
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  come out and say that she got threats after she tried to regulate drudge.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  That's a quote.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  So first, they didn't want to regulate the internet.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  They didn't want to regulate free speech.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  They didn't want to regulate the written word.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  They didn't want to regulate books and publications and newspapers.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  But now they do.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  Now they do.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  This is how horrible these people are.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  And are you surprised that out of billions of people on the internet worldwide,
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  she probably got some legitimate threats.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  You're a public figure trying to get rid of free speech, lady.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  The British tried that with the colonies and there was a war over it.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  They also tried to take the guns.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  It was called 1776.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  When there's Fourth of July and you're sitting on your big mansion or whatever
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  with all the looted money from all your insider buddies,
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  that's what the hot dogs and hamburgers and explosions are,
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  is simulations of Fort Sumner and other forts under attack.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  That's what the Star Spangled Banner is about.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  Oh, so can you see, as I butcher that.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Oh, say can you see.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  In fact, can somebody bring me the Star Spangled Banner so I can,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  I got it pretty much memorized, but I'll bungle or bumble some of it.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  Maybe we should just get some beautiful rendition of the Star Spangled Banner
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  and then play that for her so she understands what the bombs bursting in air means.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  But still through the night, our flag was still there being bombarded by the British fleet.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  So, so can you see the Star Spangled Banner.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  Do you understand that, lady?
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  I mean, you come to take everything we've got.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  You tell us we have no free speech.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  We're bitter clingers.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  We can't have our Bible.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  We can't have our guns.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  All we can do is deliver our five-year-olds to you to learn how their boys
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  to learn dresses and if they're girls to put on boys' outfits
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  and how to get Janet Reno haircuts or how to, you know,
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  the new Ken dolls look like Rachel Maddow and the boy dolls.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  I mean, I guess they're going to look like Mary Poppins.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  I mean, we're just little Legos here for you to arrange however you want.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  We have no destiny.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  We have no consciousness.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  You're just obsessed with planet tranny and people that aren't even hating you.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  I don't think about such.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  I don't care.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  You're just constantly hopping around, you know,
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  declaring our children belong to you, foaming at the mouth.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  And then Drudge wants to link to Hillary's speeches, you know,
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  where she's saying she's going to get our guns and you don't want that political speech.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  You say it's political that she wants our guns
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  and that we don't want to be disarmed so we can't show people what she said.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  It's just like separation church and state.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  That's in a letter from Thomas Jefferson about not having a state-run religion,
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  which I totally agree with Jefferson.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  Then they misrepresent it to Christians and say,
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  Jefferson wants to ban your churches and your free speech.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  No, Congress shall make no law.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  He helped write the Bill of Rights.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  That's the first half of the First Amendment.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  Then of the press and people to assemble and all the rest of it.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  Okay?
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  So they have no jurisdiction.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  And they have no jurisdiction over my speech.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  They can claim political money to a candidate has some type of regulation.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  But see, now that's down to my speech writing an article saying Hillary Clinton
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  is a demonic mobster pig and an enemy of this country
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  bought off by the Gulf state supporting the suppression of women worldwide.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  We have another in a long list of fake hate crimes,
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  this time being reported by KVU News in Austin.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  The man who said an employee at Whole Foods
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000]  wrote a homophobic slur on a cake, has withdrawn his lawsuit
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  and now says that the company, quote, did nothing wrong.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  Jordan Brown made the initial allegations more than three weeks ago.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  He said at the time that he ordered a cake with the phrase love wins on it
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  but instead got a cake with a homophobic slur.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  Whole Foods has now dropped their countersuit after, quote,
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  the truth has come to light in, quote, according to a statement from the company.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  Brown said in a statement Monday morning that he was wrong to pursue the matter
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  and use the media to perpetrate the story.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  He went on to apologize to Whole Foods
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  and its team members for questioning their commitment to values.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  Brown's apology came after Whole Foods released a video debunking Brown's story.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs,
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  and start at InfowarsLife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, we're live.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  We're into the second hour. Thank you for joining us. Wide open phones, 800-259-9231.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  While we covered probably 80 stories last hour, I did a pretty good job, I think, overall.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  I played a lot of clips. I'm going to play more clips and analyze them right now,
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  then go right to your phone calls and then more news.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  After I take a couple rounds of calls, I'm going to actually get to these videos.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  Video on Infowars.com and PresidentPlanet.com right now, a Paul Joseph Watson article.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  A Muslim scholar celebrates extinction of blue-eyed, blonde-haired Germans.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  So we have a video of the Green Party and other Muslim leaders getting up saying,
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  Yeah, get rid of the white people. This is wonderful.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  I mean, this is the biggest line of racism I've ever heard,
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  and it just shows what leftist brainwashing does to people.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  I'll be honest, I've always been an inclusive, very open person,
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  but when folks are running around saying this openly, it gets old.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  And a lot of folks that, quote, aren't white, but also a lot of them are white,
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  they just are so out of their minds, they think it's normal to say whites are inherently bad.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  So that's coming up. 80% of Brits would be happy to quit Russia.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  80% of Brits would be happy to quit UK for Russia after Putin offers free land.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  That's a real story. We're going to get to that.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  Italy set the double baby bonus to fight birth rate apocalypse, no-go areas,
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  huge increase in attacks on police in Sweden by the wonderful radical jihadis that have been brought in en masse.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  But before I do that and go to your phone calls, I want to play a couple of these clips here.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  I already played Hillary saying, don't worry, I'm going to get your guns,
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  and I'm going to stack the Supreme Court when I win, and we're going to take the guns and promising to do so.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  Let's play a clip of Nancy Pelosi, another mob boss.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  I mean, she is mafia, folks. Look into her.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  And went to Congress with no money, worth hundreds of millions now. I mean, just a monstrous creature.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  And she says, I guarantee Trump will not be president here today, gone tomorrow.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  That's the same thing the actor George Clooney says, because he hates women,
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  because he doesn't want to bring Muslims in. I mean, just upside down world.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  Let's go ahead and play Nancy Don Carleone Pelosi.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  You know what? He's not going to be president.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  He is not, Donald Trump is not going to be president of the United States.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  Take it to the bank. I guarantee it.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  All right. All right.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  And hopefully, and I'm certain it will happen, when we have our nominee, whoever she may be,
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  she will take this debate to a higher plane.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  And nobody, you would never stoop to a higher plane.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  That's not who we are. When people complain about Donald Trump talking about Mexicans,
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  talking about Muslims, talking about women and all the rest, that's what we hear every day in the Congress.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  And not in private, in committee, on the floor, in press conferences.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  If you put side by side, what some of our members have said, important members, chairs of committees and the rest,
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  he's here today, gone tomorrow, candidate for president.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  That's enough.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  I mean, if we had 40 million Americans in Mexico waving American flags, the Mexicans would flip out.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  Even if it was Americans bringing money and jobs.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  But we're getting mainly poor people in. We're collapsing. We're going bankrupt.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  The multinationals are doing this. It's not racist to say,
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  we can't have 10,000 women coming in every week from China to have their babies for free.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  And then even, quote, wealthy Chinese come here. Because why shouldn't you have a $30,000, $40,000 birth here for free?
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  Even rich people come here because we're such a joke.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  Because the globalists know taxpayers are paying for it all and they're collapsing us by design.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  And then she sits there and turns it into, we're going to a higher plane.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  Like the Lolita Express with the convicted pedophile with Clinton flying around with little kids.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  I mean, up at 33,000 feet where nobody can save them. At 30,000 feet, no one can hear you scream.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  And on Pito Island, no one can hear you scream when that weird, undead zombie Bill Clinton walks into the bedroom.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  We got to get weaponized against these people.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  We can't back down. We got to go all the way against these enemies of the Republic.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  Let's go ahead now and go to another clip. Here's Bill Clinton talking like Donald Trump on immigration in 1996.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  One of these areas is the problem of illegal immigration.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  We have to stop the inflow of illegals coming into our country.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  This administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  We will build a wall. It will do what it's supposed to do. Keep illegal immigrants out.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  We are increasing border controls by 50%.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  We're going to have a border. It's going to be a real border. We have a country. We have to have borders.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  We are increasing inspections to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  And tonight I announce I will sign an executive order to deny federal contracts to businesses that hire illegal immigrants.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  What are we going to do about illegal hiring?
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  You can be very, very strong. It could be a huge financial penalty. It could be beyond a financial penalty.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  We can't do that with you verifying with the race.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  We should honor every legal immigrant here working hard to be a good citizen.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  But we are also a nation of laws.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  We have a country. We have to have laws. We either have a country or we don't.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  Now, you can just type in Mexico, the worst on immigrants, Mexico, the hardest on illegals,
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  six months to one-year hard labor. If you've got credit cards and ID, they call your family in Guatemala or wherever
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  and try to shake money out of you.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  And then they also will torture the illegals or even Mexican citizens to find out if they're hiding illegals
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  or they're illegals to shake money out of them.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  That's what Mexico does to its own people. It does it to tourists that go out of the tourist zones.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  I mean, warning to Americans, folks. If you're going to Mexico, there's four or five cities you can go to now
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  and a few other zones, but you better not go into the other areas because you'll be shaken down.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  And that's the fact. Like, don't go to North Korea. It's dangerous.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  And Mexico is degenerating. And I don't take pleasure in that.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  Believe me, if there was a safer country around here, I'd be getting out of here.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  I mean, this country, I don't think you can fix it at some levels.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  Those of us that don't want to be slaves and start saying no to the system
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  and try to create communities based on freedom.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  And I guess migrate the states that are not going to go along with this,
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  but we are in the hands of really, really evil people, folks.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  Now, let's go ahead and go to another clip that I want to break down here.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  And that's dealing with what's happening with Joy Behar.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  I've been on her show before, both of you and on her CNN show.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  There's a pretty nice lady behind the scenes. Don't blame Hillary for Bill
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  unless you blame Melina for Trump's sexual harassment.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  That is such a horrible statement.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  Melina has only been married to him, what is it, Melania for, I don't know, 10 years or whatever.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  I can't pronounce any names, including my own. Sorry, folks. No teleprompter.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  And Hillary was there politically going after these women and saying they were liars actively.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  And Clinton settled rape cases and got caught engaged in perjury.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  We're talking about Trump asking women out when he wasn't married
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  and Trump telling an old girlfriend 30 years ago in the 80s she was overweight.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  And now that's been recanted by the girlfriend.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  So it's apples and oranges.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  Yes, if she was defending Trump years after he settled rape cases
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  and she was political, then you could criticize her.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  But she hasn't done that yet and Donald Trump hasn't done anything.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  So this is how they've scrambled reality. Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  Is he guilty of sexual harassment when he accuses Bill Clinton often of sexual harassment?
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  Okay, that's another thing. You know what, they're going to bring up Bill Clinton.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  When he gets accused of all of this, he brings up Bill Clinton.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  Okay, Bill Clinton's a dog also. What does that have to do with Hillary Clinton?
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  Are we going to blame Melania for this piece in The Times?
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  Melania hasn't covered anything up because Donald Trump hasn't done anything.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  Just because you write a 16-page article about how he would go to cocktail parties
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  and ask good-looking women out or ask them what they like to do for fun.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  I mean, what man hasn't done that before they were married or after they were married?
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  But see, being normal is freakazoid nowadays.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  I want to go to your phone calls. We're going to do that when we come back from this break.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  But first, I want to play the ex who was misquoted as saying that he said she was fat once
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  and that was just the end of the world.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  This is Ms. Lane talking about the fact that he was a gentleman on Fox.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  I did not have a negative experience with Donald Trump.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  And I don't appreciate them making it look like that I was saying that it was a negative experience.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  You knew him very well, right? You dated him for several months?
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  That's correct, yes. And he never made me feel like I was being demeaned in any way.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  He never offended me in any way. He was very gracious.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  I saw him around all types of people, all types of women.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  He was very kind, thoughtful, generous. He was a gentleman.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  Yeah, I know a lot of people that have known Donald Trump not just stone for 30, 40 years and they just say the guy is so nice
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  unless you mess with him. That it's just wild.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  In fact, even the brash guy you see on the Apprentice and stuff was an exaggeration of Trump.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  And they just treat women so good. So good.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  But he also doesn't put up with any crap. Zero from women. Zero.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  Totally nice to him. Best houses flying around the world. Caviar.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  You know, the best exercise, you know, the best transportation, the best homes, everything.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  Treated like princesses, but he doesn't put up with any baloney.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  And so that's supposedly a bad thing. That's supposedly an evil thing.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  That's supposedly a horrible thing.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  But I've talked to some people that work for Trump and they just say if you're a hard worker, do a good job.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  He is so loyal. His whole organization is loyal. But the minute you do sideways stuff, you're gone.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  And the amount of money he gives to charity behind the scenes is reportedly staggering.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  When everybody's heard about the stories he never talked about, about deformed kids of staff of his or people that stop on his limits,
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  he was broken down and helped give him a jump. So he paid off their, what was it, like $400,000 house mortgage.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  I mean, Trump is a wild man and they don't like him because of the fact that he's for real.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  As best I can tell folks, Donald Trump is for real. He wants to be the turnaround expert that helps the American people,
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  help him turn this country around. And the reason it's so easy is globalism is designed to make us bankrupt and dependent and controlled.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  All you do is turn off globalism and our nation state will explode.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  The United States, until 1913 on average, had a 10.2% growth rate.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  They call 3% overheating now. And that's with cooked numbers.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  So they want us poor. Donald Trump doesn't.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000]  And often leave behind bacteria which can cause problems later on.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000]  If you're sick of being sick, try Supernatural Silver.

[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:11.000]  It's true. Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply. It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer. He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  I said, let me see. Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated price competitive companies we represent and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.

[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  People can see the scope of the plot.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.800]  as we know how able these people are. And then they just invert reality. You can take
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:33.560]  the speeches of Trump and their word for word, what Clinton and others said,
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:37.160]  because it's common sense, but the Clintons didn't act on what they did. And that's my biggest
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:42.040]  concern is that Trump wouldn't act on what he says he'll do. And I think he's for real. I think
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:45.320]  that's why they're so scared of him because they wouldn't be scared of him. If he wasn't for real,
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:50.280]  they'd love it. We're going to find out. I know that. I want to go to your phone calls and coming
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:56.200]  up EU chief calls Boris Johnson's EU, Nazi comparison absurd. That's the front runner for
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:01.480]  the British Prime Minister ship right now, former mayor of London. There's a good video up on info
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:09.000]  wars.com where David Knight breaks it down. The Texas exit, Texas exit, eight reasons for Texas
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:16.120]  secession. My biggest reason, and I want to keep the Republic together, but if our country's totally
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:21.880]  run by globalists and already gone and under multinational subdivision and receivership,
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:26.520]  then we've got to just try to keep some part of America alive. And then we just announced
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:30.680]  Texas is what's left and a few other states and others that want to be somewhat free market,
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:35.400]  not suicidal and join us. I mean, you know, that's one way is to have the states pull
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:38.680]  out of the federal government because it's a legitimate and a lot of scholars are saying that
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:43.960]  now. I mean, we're really under global receivership in their own words. We've been
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:48.680]  maneuvered into Iraq and ruin. The whole world is unraveling into hell.
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:53.400]  The wealthiest area of Spain voted like 89%
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:59.720]  to leave six months ago. Remember that in Catalonia, Catalonia, beautiful place. I've been there
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:05.320]  and the central government said you can't leave. Well, what do you do when 89% say we're not playing
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:10.200]  ball anymore? It's game over. I don't care what you say or what you do. You cannot stop the people.
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:14.600]  And so they're having referendums to just, just pull out one. What's Spain going to do?
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:20.280]  Roll tanks in? They don't even have an industry now because of the environmental regulations.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:23.800]  The whole country is shutting down and Catalan doesn't want to do it.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:28.040]  They don't want to commit suicide with you.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:33.640]  Steve, Manny, John, Cody and many others are going to you right now.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:38.600]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Maryland. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:45.640]  Hey, Alex. I just want to get your take on Trump meeting with Kissinger. We know who Kissinger is
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:49.480]  and I don't want to look at this from a standpoint that Trump's not doing.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:52.120]  Well, it's okay to criticize Trump about it. Go ahead. I mean, go ahead. Give us your take. It's
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:58.360]  all right. I just don't see the benefit in this and I was hoping to get your take on it because
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.480]  you studied this stuff. You understand it and I'm just trying to get another viewpoint on this.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:08.520]  Well, we've got a story up on infowars.com with the headline, Oops.
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:14.120]  Trump's meeting with Kissinger. Kissinger is one of the top globalists in the world.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:19.480]  He's kind of fading like David Rockefeller is. He's pretty much in charge at many levels,
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:24.040]  advising the globalists from our research. Jane Becker, still a big kingmaker, and he's
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:28.440]  met with Richard N. Haas of the Council on Farm Relations. He's in the top 20.
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:40.120]  He met last week in Houston at his law firm. Trump did with James Baker, who's still high-powered,
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:44.440]  and now he's meeting with Kissinger. And it's, uh-oh, Trump to meet with Kissinger
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:50.040]  for foreign policy advice. Steve Watson face-to-face session comes after weeks of phone conversations.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:55.480]  If Trump didn't meet with them, they'd come after me with that much hardcore.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:58.600]  After he met with Haas, Haas came out and attacked him a week later,
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:02.920]  and Trump didn't change his rhetoric. He got more nationalistic, more anti-globalist.
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:06.920]  Trump has not changed his rhetoric after he met last week with James Baker.
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:11.880]  So I don't care if he meets with these people, but I do care if he changes his rhetoric and then
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:18.680]  changes his actions. I personally have had Rothkopf, the second command to Kissinger,
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.480]  the head of the Kissinger Group on when he was the head of the Kissinger Group,
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:27.000]  he came on the show and John Harmon heard it during the breaks. I said, you know I'm Alex Jones,
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.720]  right? And he said, oh, we know who you are, but I thought you want to talk to me and be
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:33.640]  sold on this. You're a smart guy. You know, you ought to be involved. You ought to come to some
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:37.640]  of our meetings. And I kept chewing him out for 30 minutes. At the end of it, he said, I never
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:44.440]  talked to you again. I can't believe you're so stupid and hung up. So I've been in meetings with
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:48.600]  CEOs. I've had the globalists invite me to things when I'm already somewhere. A lot of times I'll
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.440]  be in LA or New York or London and the phone rings here at the office and they say such-and-such
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:57.480]  wants to meet with you in private. And so I've gone and met with some pretty high-powered folks.
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:01.640]  Usually it's gopher level right below a Kissinger, right below a Baker, or I mean,
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:05.960]  I've met with presidents and CEOs of media companies. So I've been at the top of those
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:10.200]  and man, they give you a new world order, global government speech and I tell them,
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:14.760]  listen, I hear all how it's a great idea, but really it's for centralized control eugenics.
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:20.200]  And they'll just say, Alex, you're a smart guy. You really should be with us. But they know I'm a
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:25.400]  journalist and if I ever blow confidence in one of these private meetings, I'll never get those
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:31.800]  type of information again. So that's why I don't come out and say the specifics of what went on.
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:36.920]  But they don't, they hold their cards close to their vest too. But I mean, I've had them,
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:40.600]  just like Mark Dice was in a meeting with the media head and he said, look, let's just worship,
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:44.680]  listen for together. Mark, I've had them do that with me, too. I mean, these people are freaks,
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:52.440]  folks. I'm going to come back to you, Steve, stay there. We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:56.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:05.960]  The military has turned to a directed energy frequency jammer mounted on an assault rifle
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:11.880]  frame to deal with the growing threat of small drones to military bases and troops in the field,
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:17.480]  reports Defense Tech. Officials of Battle Fielding, the non-profit research and development
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:23.080]  organization, said Monday the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security had signed off
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:29.720]  on buying 100 units of its drone defender, billed as the safe solution for warding off intruding
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:36.120]  unmanned aerial vehicles. It's a portable solution to stop portable drones, said Rich Granger,
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:42.440]  a battle director for mission and defense technologies. The drone defender has two triggers,
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:47.480]  a command and control trigger to sever the link between the pilot and the UAV,
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:31:00.280]  and a second trigger to jam GPS links to the drone. You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:23.400]  of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs. In the history

[01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:01.560]  Take action now before we sell out. Hi, yeah. First of all, I want to say,
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:06.920]  take the 12 X2, Super Metal, Brain, Force, Prosthetic Arts, Silver Bullet. I use them all.
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:11.320]  They're phenomenal. They work. Buy them, folks. Thank you, brother. Thank you guys for putting
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:16.840]  those out there. I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm a quite a supporter of your

[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:26.840]  nutraceuticals that support your health and the info war at the same time. I'm a nine-year listener.

[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:35.320]  Have they worked for you? They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:40.360]  What products are you taking? Are you taking? Everything from Super Metal to Brain, Force,
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:46.920]  to Winter Sun, uh, X2, even got a little, uh, DNA force. So when I just re-upped everything and I
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:52.040]  just went to Autofill. Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:33:11.640]  see the reviews for yourselves. That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:22.120]  From the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. All right, I'm going right back to your calls,
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:27.400]  then I'm getting into a situation in Europe with the radical Muslims demanding full control of
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:32.440]  everything, running around intimidating everybody, beating people up, shutting down bars, attacking
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:37.160]  women wearing miniskirts, and the police are defending it, and the leftists and the Green
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:43.880]  Parties are defending it with pleasure. They want to dominate culture, they want control,
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:51.560]  and they've got their bully boys, that'll do it. And they mean business. So coming up,
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:55.880]  top Imam Muslim migrants should breed with Europeans to conquer their countries. That's
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:03.320]  an article from months ago by Paul Watson. The latest one actually gets into all of this,
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:08.920]  and it is pretty incredible where they say, we'll get rid of the blonde-haired blue-eyed people.
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:12.600]  Muslim scholars celebrate the extinction of blue-eyed, blonde-haired Germans. That's coming
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:17.160]  up in a moment. First off, I'm not going to belabor this, but I'm talking to the listeners
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:22.600]  that have heard the show and heard me talk about iodine deficiency and heard me talk about
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:30.520]  the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, the list goes on and on. Your glands, like the thyroid,
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:38.680]  but not just the thyroid, get filled with the bad halogens that they admit cause all sorts of
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:45.160]  medical problems, cancer, you name it, and fry your hormone, endocrine systems. If it's not
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:51.320]  a chemical weapon, boy, it should be. And they know Harvard admits fluoride lowers IQ, causes
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:56.600]  thyroid cancer, bone cancer. Just check it out for yourself. Well, what blocks it? Because your body
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:01.880]  won't absorb this into your glands if you've got good iodine. Most people have massive iodine
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:07.080]  deficiencies, even if some of the iodine in food is bound to other metals and other chemicals.
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:13.000]  We have pure iodine. It's like 999999. Deep Earth comes from purple crystals that if you
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.240]  drop one on the ground, like the movie Alien, it burns through the ground like five floors.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:25.960]  It doesn't burn chromatic stuff, but it burns everything else. We have video of it in a Petri
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:30.200]  dish with just normal heat under it. It turns into purple gas. You think, I love genies about to
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:34.920]  fly out the top. That's why it's so pure. It doesn't come from the ocean. It's not bound to salt,
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:41.640]  it's not bound to other heavy metals. It's totally pure, totally clean. And your body just slurps it
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:45.720]  up right into the cells. And it's changed my life the last three and a half years I've been taking
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:50.680]  it. It is a very inexpensive infowarslife.com. Couple drops over the tongue, couple drops in
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:54.840]  water every day. It is amazing. Consult your physician before you take it. Because if your
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:36:00.920]  thyroid is already full of garbage and about to melt down anyways, I guess hypothetically you
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:04.920]  could have some issues. Not with this, but because of where you were already at. So consult your
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:09.960]  physician. It says I'm on the bottle. But without iodine, you die. Consult your physician before
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:14.600]  you breathe oxygen as well, just from the air. I'm serious. Before you walk, consult the physician.
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:20.600]  Before you eat green peas. Before you get one hour of sunshine. Just the nanny state loves you.
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:27.800]  Okay, just don't, don't buy survival skill nation out on X2. No, seriously, it's amazing infowarslife.com
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:33.880]  have a patented system that Dr. Krip got from the Russians to do this. It is amazing. The gas is
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:41.400]  injected lifetime into a very complex process into organic palm oil. And it's super active.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:47.800]  infowarslife.com or call toll 3888-253-3139. We're doing the sale one more day and it's over. Food
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:54.600]  sale is over. But one more day on the anthroplex that is a male enhancement for energy strength
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.400]  libido. But I don't know why we put male because it's just as good for females. Dr. Krip says
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:03.800]  it's got a lot of the herbs that are in super male vitality. They're organic, but they're dry herbs.
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:08.040]  So it isn't as hard to produce as it is and it's expensive. And super male is very affordable,
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:12.840]  but it's so hard to get all the time. The dry, the wet herbs that it's sold out half the time. So
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:19.160]  we have a basically dry version that's about half the price. And I think it's almost as good.
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:23.640]  Some people say it's even better. The point is, look out when you take this, talk to your physician
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:29.800]  again, because if I take two of these, I'm like a Tyrannosaurus. Well, I'm more than that to quote
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:34.760]  Jesse Ventura. What's he saying, predator? He's chewing tobacco. He says, this stuff won't make
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:40.760]  you a sexual Tyrannosaurus. Well, that's not why I take it. But dramatic effects is what
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:45.000]  people normally notice in a day or two. And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:48.600]  Regardless, you can't lose because you're funding the hardcore broadcast.
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:59.080]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or you can simply call toll
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:07.960]  free 888-253-3139. That's 888-253-3139. I want to thank you all for your support, free shipping

[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:17.880]  We've got like, what, 19 different products now at infowarslife.com? And then of course,
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:22.440]  we have over 1,000 products total at infowarsstore.com from Ola on Lobby t-shirts,
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:26.680]  the Hillary for President t-shirts, so you name it. By the way, we did a hashtag
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:33.400]  handcuffs for Hillary. Joe Biggs did with Liam McAdoo and Pat Riley, one of our latest editions
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:39.320]  here at the office, longtime friend of mine. And we sold out of almost every size over the weekend.
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:43.560]  But good news, we didn't take them down and say that they were backordered because I don't count
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:50.200]  it as backordered when the truck is on its way right now from the factory on the east coast where
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:56.120]  these are made, right here in America, to Austin. And so it should be here tomorrow. So they are not
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:02.280]  sold out just in time, a 4.9 rating on these shirts. Hillary for President on the front,
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:09.480]  2016 on the back, in red legalizedfreedominfowars.com. And it's causing a phenomenon of people
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:17.000]  meeting like-minded people on the street. It's causing a phenomenon of at Trump rallies,
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.320]  other Liberty-based rallies where like 1 in 10, 1 in 5 now are wearing the shirts.
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:26.520]  It's causing a huge phenomenon and it's helping fund this operation to cover Bilderberg,
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:30.520]  to cover the RNC, the DNC, to have our reporters in the field around the country every day and
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:35.240]  around the world. That is expensive but newsmaking is giving the people eyes and ears out there.
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:39.560]  We also have to make America free hat triple pack where you can buy them individually.
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:42.920]  I don't know if it's a rip off of Trump but it's made in America by the same manufacturer
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:48.840]  and it's just make America free again. And on the back it says infowars.com with a Molan
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:54.680]  Labe snake on there. They don't tread on me snakey. So this is a hat I love,
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:40:01.720]  turns a lot of heads, meet like-minded people, infowars.com for that as well.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:07.240]  Okay, let's now go right back to the caller. Stephen, if folks just joined as you called in
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:13.960]  and said, Trump has been talking something to Kissinger on the phone and now he's going to
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:20.840]  meet with him in person. If Kissinger comes out and endorses Trump, I will be very troubled by that
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:25.000]  because it'll show that they're trying to get close to him. Now if they think they can't defeat
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.640]  him, they may try to cozy up to be close to him so he trusts them so they can insert somebody in
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:35.480]  there like George Herbert Walker Bush with Reagan. But if I see Trump back off his stances
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:41.160]  or if I see him not deliver on his promises, then I will turn against Donald Trump.
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:46.840]  But I think the fact that he's trying to be the president of the U.S., he's got to meet with the
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:53.480]  foreign policy wonks who've run this country for decades or they will kill him. And a lot of these
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:56.520]  gangsters work like that. If you meet with them and at least treat them with respect,
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:03.080]  they may not kill you right away. But if you don't know that Henry Kissinger is a major dangerous
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:07.480]  gangster, you're crazy. So quite frankly, if I was Donald Trump, I would meet with Haas,
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:10.440]  I would meet with Kissinger, I would meet with all of them and I'd tell them,
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:13.400]  you've done a lot of really bad things, you've sold out America to this global government,
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:17.960]  it's not working, even if you're for it. I believe nationalism is the way to go and the
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:22.440]  people are not going to go along with your plan anymore. And so you need to realize that if you
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:26.760]  just back off, you can keep your wealth. If you don't back off, you're going to end up,
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:30.600]  you know, getting arrested down the road because you're trying to set up such authoritarian systems.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:35.640]  The same message I give the globalist every day here. And I've had the head of the Kissinger
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:43.480]  group, Rothkopf, the direct minion, the number two, the mini me, the baby evil of Kissinger,
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:47.720]  try in front of John Harmon. John, if you're in there, turn your mic on. You're up in Minnesota
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:51.640]  because you were there when he was on nine years ago for 45 minutes. You were there during the
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:57.160]  breaks. What did Rothkopf say to me during the breaks? If I recall correctly, he was just basically
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:00.920]  trying to recruit you. He said something along the lines like, you aren't going to win this thing
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:07.640]  and you should just join us. And I mean, it was pretty blatant. And he was just, are you kidding
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:13.480]  me? Like, is this really happening? And that went on for like three breaks. And he said, look,
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:17.720]  you're part of the superclass. You're the top conspiracy guy that, you know, our opposition.
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:21.480]  You're challenging our worldview. You're challenging our narrative. Same thing that
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:26.520]  Roevin said about history's actors. And he was just basically saying, you can have your place in
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:32.120]  this, but you've got to under the, under the table, join us. And what did he say from memory?
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:35.400]  Because I know you were listening. You were blown away and you actually came on here and talked about
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:41.080]  it. And it wasn't off record. He didn't say this is off record. That's why I even said, hey, you
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:45.000]  know, my board ops listening right now, you're talking to the studio. And he's like, ah, whatever,
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.440]  you're just too dumb to understand that. What else did you hear him say?
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:55.320]  I mean, that was, that was pretty much the gist of it. I mean, it happened so long ago.
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:59.880]  But yeah, he was trying to recruit you. And it was for real. I couldn't believe it.
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:03.960]  And I mean, some of the conversations that happened off the air during the breaks are the most
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:08.920]  hardcore things on the show. And yeah, it's supposed to be in confidence or whatever. But
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:15.160]  it's moments like that. I wish we were recording our off air conversations. But yeah, he was,
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:20.120]  he was trying to recruit you, recruit you. Yeah, Ross couldn't believe that he was like inviting
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:25.480]  me to come up to New York and inviting me to, I was just, oh yes, let me immediately join the
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:30.600]  New World Order. But see, Glenn Beck's going to meet with Zuckerberg. See, he gets the calls. He is,
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:34.840]  he is on it. And that's why he went on TV two weeks ago and said, I've got the guy that did
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:39.720]  American Idol and Oreo is working for me. I've got establishment with me. Folks don't want the
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:45.240]  establishment, not in the end game. I mean, you don't sell out to these people and go anywhere
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:49.800]  now. This is a bad idea. And that's what they're betting on. That, you know, you should just sell
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:56.280]  out because you can't beat them. And it's, it's messed up. Yeah. Well, I can't sell out to an
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:01.800]  elite that keeps getting caught on airplanes, a little kids. I mean, it'd be one thing if it was
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:06.520]  boss hog stuff, and they were nationalistic and pro gun and didn't have it out for the family. And
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:09.160]  you know, there was some other corrupt group trying to take up with the government. So I
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:14.440]  sided with some other group that still did some bad stuff, you know, inside contracts or something.
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:18.600]  I mean, totally honest, I would try to reform it from within. I don't support stuff like that.
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:23.640]  But I would not be fighting, risking my life, saying things and doing things that are very
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:30.520]  dangerous. I wouldn't be going all out every day if this didn't absolutely mean the death of freedom
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:35.480]  if these people win. I mean, they are so bad, folks, you cannot join with them. So when I
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:39.800]  sit up here and say, I'll never sell out, it is because I'm a good guy and I have moral values.
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:45.720]  But at the same time, I wouldn't be in an all out 110% fight if these people weren't pure evil.
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:51.320]  That's my view. A lot of folks say, why don't you just compromise? You can get more done on the
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:57.560]  inside. No, you can't. No, you can't compromise with these people. They're eugenicists. They're
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:02.600]  globalist. They have it out for the general public. They're evil. Does that answer your question,
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:08.600]  Steven? Yes. And for me, this kind of ties into the Hillary and the Second Amendment attack.
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:12.200]  I live in Maryland. In order to buy a handgun, you have to take a class
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:17.960]  with us four hours. Then you have to wait 30 days to get that HQL in the mail.
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:22.360]  Then you can go purchase the gun. Then you have to wait eight days after purchasing that gun
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:27.320]  in order to come back and pick it up because you need a cold off there. So gun control does not
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:33.160]  work because as we all know, Baltimore is right up there with the rest of them. DC, right up there
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:38.760]  with the rest of them. And you can even buy a gun in DC. So for me, this is just part of the
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:44.920]  bigger picture. It's a piece of it for me. And I understand where you're coming from. So thanks.
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:49.800]  God bless you. I appreciate your call. We know Trump's the best of the field. I don't go for
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:55.000]  lesser of evils, but he is a populist. He's anti-globalist. What he's saying won't be dialed back.
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.720]  It's damaging. That's why I think he's real. But regardless, we don't just stop there. We
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:04.040]  start at the states, the local levels. We fight at every front. We fight with the decisions we
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:09.080]  make of what media we support, what grocery stores we support, what stores we support.
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:16.040]  We aggressively live our lives to build up independent Americana Liberty-based systems.
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:21.560]  John and Ohio, then we've got Manny and Mass, and Victor in Florida,
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:24.840]  and Cody in South Carolina. Cody's been holding the longest. I don't go to Manny.
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:29.640]  Cody in South Carolina, you're on the air. Hey, Jones. Pleasure to talk to you, brother.
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:34.440]  Thank you, sir. I'm just a little fired up. You got to talking about the
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:38.760]  Homo Cake Baker scandal for Whole Foods. Now, I just want to comment and say that what you and
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:43.720]  your team have been reporting on the past couple years with these cultural fascists taking over
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:49.240]  society absolutely spot on target. I'm a recent college graduate from Clemson University down
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:53.880]  here in South Carolina. I think they did your Tangy Tangerine study with the cancer cells in
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:58.760]  the stomach. But anyways, we're actually being invaded right now by social justice warriors,
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:03.720]  and they're, you know, oh, yeah, they're new businesses to sue people for their free speech.
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:07.880]  Those who don't know, a pastor to drop lawsuit against Whole Foods over anti-gay slur on cake.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:11.720]  If we read the bottom of the article, the honest American statesman, also all the other stations,
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:16.280]  to learn that they have the surveillance footage of him leaving with the cake over the register
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:21.800]  and over the bakery without the word fag on it. And now he's, quote, apologized, but didn't say he
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:26.760]  did it. He wants them to drop their lawsuit against him again. But then the leftist won't
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:33.080]  even admit it was a false flag staged event. It should be, man tried to frame Whole Foods
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:39.320]  in part of social justice warrior Jihad. But no, they won't give you a real headline, will they?
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:44.040]  No, not at all. And here at Clemson, we're kind of coming under fire from these social justice
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:49.000]  warriors for having one of our founders back in 1889 was a white supremacist. You know, we're,
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.120]  you know, we're a reconstruction state. And as you know, there's that in our culture,
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:57.400]  in our history, unfortunately, but they capitalize on this fact. And somebody,
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:02.040]  this big scandal, somebody actually hung a bunch of bananas on an African American history sign
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:07.560]  on campus. And everybody lost their mind. It was insane. So black ops matter did a huge protest
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:12.040]  on campus for about a week. And I was like, you know, listen to you a lot for the past four years.
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:16.040]  And exactly what you said is usually an inside job. So I got to investigating,
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:20.680]  turns out word on the street, the bananas were hung by a black guy. Surprise, surprise. So out
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:24.680]  of this, what do they get? They got a bunch of attention, a bunch of protests on campus.
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:29.160]  Sure. Let's expand on that. I mean, I'll be honest with you. I never heard, except in liberal
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:33.480]  media, the stuff about watermelon and fried chicken. That's what people eat in the South.
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:38.840]  I mean, I grew up at grandma's house or when my parents were having a party with watermelon and
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:43.800]  fried chicken, you go to a fried chicken place in any city, there's white people, black people,
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:49.080]  Hispanics. It's super delicious. It's super fattening. I mean, it's just, it's crazy now.
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:54.760]  And then Bill Clinton, who I hate and who is a racist and who did all the minimum sentencing and
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:49:00.040]  all this, doesn't matter. He was in, what was it? Alabama was called to a church to do a public,
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:06.360]  you know, feed deal. And they had fried chicken at it. And they said he was racist. There's nothing
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:09.720]  racist about fried chicken. There it is. Bill Clinton visits. Oh, it was Kentucky. I was going
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:14.600]  from memory, literally serves fried chicken to black people. Well, I mean, that's just crazy.
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:19.800]  I mean, everybody eats fried chicken. It's crazy. But see, northerners don't. So that's where all
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:24.280]  this fried chicken watermelon thing comes from, is black people moved from the South to the North
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:29.960]  in the last hundred years and brought that with them. And northerners thought shitlands and
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:35.240]  all this other food was weird. And so they got ahead of African connotation. Well,
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:40.120]  it's, that's just what people in the South eat. I grew up eating collard greens and I grew up
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:45.160]  eating fried chicken and I, and I grew up eating gizzards and I grew up eating pigs feet and I
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:51.400]  grew up eating corn on the cob and I grew up eating beans and cornbread, cornbread and iced tea
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:50:00.440]  took the place of pills and 42. It's actually pills and hundred proof. But the point is that
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:05.720]  this is the mindless garbage. We're all losing our rights. We're all losing our basic liberties.
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:10.680]  We're all going under global government and we're obsessing over fried chicken and watermelon.
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:15.080]  And it's such oppressive brainwashing that when I get a watermelon, the grocery store and put it
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:21.720]  in my cart or I'm frying chicken. Now, everything has this connection that I'm, it's just, it's
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:27.640]  mind control. I appreciate your call. It's absolute total mind control. I fried chicken probably once
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:32.440]  a month, folks. I got a bunch of fresh organic chicken, shove it to some, I mean, I just love it.
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:38.360]  Bread it up, pow. Has nothing to do with what color I am. It's crazy town. But it's just like
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:42.760]  people in the North think everybody's riding horses and it's racist and, you know, and that we don't
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:49.000]  even have cars here in the South. NASA is based here. The superconducting supercolliders, the
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.400]  nuclear reactors, there's more technology in the South than in the North. I mean, it's just
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:57.640]  brainwashing. By the way, I love Northerners. It's all this divide and conquer garbage.
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:58.760]  We'll be back. Stay with us.

[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:18.120]  By the way, the Washington Post was reporting that Whole Foods isn't going to continue their
[01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:23.720]  suit against the guy that went in there, got a cake, put fag on it and then said that they did
[01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:29.080]  it to him. Try to get money. They're just going to let people pull that type of stuff on them
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:34.440]  because they're liberal. It's more social justice warrior stuff. They don't want to discourage doing
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:40.200]  that. Just don't do it to Whole Foods. Do it to the mom and pop bakery. I'm not out to get Whole
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:45.080]  Foods, but you know, I'm sick of these social justice warriors and their false flags. I've
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:50.840]  almost never seen a case where they didn't stage it and that's the type of stuff that goes on.
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:55:00.520]  Now, I want to go to Manny and Mass in John and Ohio, then we'll go to Victor, Frank, and Dave
[01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:05.800]  and others. There's a bunch of callers here. Let's go ahead now and go to Manny and Mass.
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:12.520]  You're on the air. Go ahead. Hello. Pleasure to speak with you. I try to keep this short and sweet.
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:19.400]  Okay, so basically what I wanted to put out there was the supposed most transparent president in
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:25.960]  U.S. history has, we the people bound by 19 executive orders that are hidden from us. Now,
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:31.400]  what I want to get your take on is, how do you see that in light of where we're at now with
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:35.080]  all the elections and everything going on? Well, that's right. I think it's more than 19.
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:41.000]  More than 19 of his executive orders are secret and the summaries on some of them are like,
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:46.200]  for any emergency, including economic, total martial law, Congress suspended for six months,
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:54.040]  President Obama as Supreme Leader. And the Republicans have given him authority over the
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:59.160]  economy to the next president as well to spend any money they want and not have to go get
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:06.120]  authorization from Congress. So the entire season, the entire atmosphere is one of dictatorial power.
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:12.760]  It's unprecedented. Absolutely. I couldn't agree more. But the second part I wanted to bring up
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:21.080]  to that was, do you see that, do you see those possibly being Obama's keys to the possible
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:25.160]  implementation of Sharia law here in this country? Sure. I mean, I don't think we're there yet.
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:28.520]  They're going to bring in tens of millions more Muslims from radical areas that can't even get
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:32.200]  along with each other in their own countries. They're going to bring in the invaders from all
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:35.400]  over the Middle East that came into Syria, allow them to go into Turkey, into Europe,
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:39.720]  into the U.S., then set them up, give them more welfare than citizens, more than social security
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:44.520]  recipients. That's in the Associated Press. And just set them up as a protected class,
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:51.320]  then we'll all have to comply with them or we're hate-mongers, just like Europe's doing.
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:53.960]  So that's really the long slide. Now, Europe's further along.
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:57:00.600]  They brought in 5 million in the last couple of years. And so in Europe, they are being put
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:06.600]  under Sharia law in many cities. Many cities like Paris are no-go areas, in most areas,
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:13.720]  for Europeans. Anybody else is acceptable, but the left is combined forces to create racism
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:19.560]  for Dubai and conquer. So then the national state can come in and basically have martial law
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:25.080]  and a civil emergency permanently to protect all the other subgroups from the incompatible Muslims
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:31.080]  that months before, we're murdering everyone around them in the Middle East. So this is a
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:35.400]  designed takedown of Europe. It's a military operation. It's going very, very well,
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:41.640]  devastating Europe. I appreciate your call. Let's jam in one more call. Let's talk to Dave in PA.
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:46.680]  Dave, you're on the air. Go ahead. Yeah, I got the Hillary for prison t-shirt. Just love it.
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:50.520]  Boy, do I get some looks from a lot of people when I wear that out. But the reason why I'm calling
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:56.920]  you there, Alex, here earlier on Best Common Sense Coalition program, a gentleman called in and said
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:58:01.880]  something about that slimy little creature, Newt Gingrich, wanting to be Donald Trump's Vice
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:05.800]  President. That has been admitted. That has been admitted. And I don't like the idea. Look,
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:10.840]  he sees the tea leaves. He's a smart globalist and he wants to attach himself to Trump and Trump's
[01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:15.080]  being friendly. I think that's a very, very bad move. I wouldn't like that. What do you say?
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:21.960]  That's slimy little creature. Well, I mean, he is, he is a globalist who poses as a conservative,
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:24.120]  but the folks know his real record. He's dangerous. What do you think?
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:30.280]  It's just another of them rhinos. You know, it's like, we got to get rid of these people that have
[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:35.320]  caused the problems and correct the problems, because these people should be taken and brought
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:38.760]  up on trains and charges for what they've done to their country. Absolutely. We'll be back in 70
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:41.720]  seconds. Thank you, Dave. More calls straight ahead. Third hour. Thank you for listening.

[01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:53.560]  Hey, everyone. Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side. And as many of you know,

[01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:03.080]  despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman,
[01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:07.720]  and child in this country. Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses
[01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:11.640]  are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge,
[01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:16.200]  and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing with a
[01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:19.640]  health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're

[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:54.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:14.600]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:25.320]  Mother, tell your children not to walk my way. Tell your children not to hear my words. What
[02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:33.720]  they mean, what they say. Mother, big mother, Hillary. Mother, can you keep them in the dark for
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:43.880]  life? Can you hide them? Oh, a lot of soul in that voice.
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:57.080]  I'm going to show them everything you're doing. You want to ram heads with me? Get ready.
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:07.000]  Go ahead and go right back to your phone calls. I want to go to Frank and John and Victor and Carlos
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:13.320]  and Joe. Holding the longest is a man in Ohio, John. Let's talk about the robotic police force in
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:16.920]  Japan. I remember reading about that 10 years ago. They planned it for a couple years. They got
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:21.240]  robots on the streets now. That ties into some of this other news I'm going to get to later,
[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:26.040]  but John in Ohio, thanks for calling. Thanks for holding her on the air. Well, Alex,
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:31.080]  this is the whole thing, and I have, I diagnosed this from the first day when I heard about the
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:36.040]  racial profiling thing. I said, what they are setting up, the elite are setting up a position
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:42.040]  where they could say all human being police officers are evil. Therefore, we need to replace
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:46.520]  it with artificial intelligence, which would not see race. It would just see. Brother, you're,
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:51.000]  you're absolutely singing my song. It's right out of the new Robocop tells you exactly what they're
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:56.760]  planning. And then it takes human decision making out because they're sick of police and military
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:01.400]  over and over again, not, you know, not going along with tyranny. And so that's why the whole
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:06.600]  demonization, the whole UN program, the, the strong cities initiative they admit is to quote,
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:12.680]  federalize the police, take over the military, ruin it with women in frontline combat. So it all
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:17.320]  goes obsolete. So we accept autonomous robots. That's an admitted plan. And I'm trying to get
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:23.560]  that word out to people. Go ahead. I just wanted to ask you something. Um, years ago in the years,
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:29.320]  about 1783, there was a Colonel Jonathan Williams who supposedly wrote a book called Legion of
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:34.360]  Satan. It was about the Illuminati plan to completely destroy humanity because their
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:40.600]  eventual plan is to exterminate all the races of man, not just white. And this, uh, Jonathan Williams,
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:45.560]  who was a colonel in Washington's army, wrote this book. Senator Joe McCarthy quotes this in
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:51.160]  1956. Eustace Mullins quotes this book. I have called the antiquarian society. I have called
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:55.080]  everywhere trying to find this. And all they can tell me is the book doesn't exist.
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:59.960]  Well, if you Google it says Jonathan Williams, legions of Satan,
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:05.560]  and they, you know, break down supposedly pieces of it. But I know that there have been
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:11.320]  a lot of, uh, you know, books are supposedly written that people can't find. But I will dig
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:15.560]  into that and look into that. All I know is it was another book written called proves of this
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:20.440]  conspiracy that went out of print. And then I do have a copy of it. It was reprinted and put out
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:25.800]  by Mark Dice where they talk about criminal groups using the Masonic system. Not that the Masons were
[02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:31.640]  bad, but evil groups using the secrecy of it. The, uh, the, the, the departmentalized nature of it
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:38.040]  to set up their organized crime takeover, uh, and not to eliminate the people, but to actually
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:42.680]  dumb them down and dominate them. So regardless, we are under a criminal conspiracy to dumb down
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:47.960]  humanity. What do you say, John? I say exactly right, but I, but like I said, they are taking
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:52.040]  stuff right out of the library of Congress. In fact, just like the Albert Pike letter,
[02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:57.960]  which people claims don't exist, the cardinal, the archbishop of, of the nation of Chile saw
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:02.520]  the letter in 1925 and put it in a book, secrets of Freemasonry unveiling.
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:08.520]  Supposedly it's a naval naval war college there in London. Look, all I know is Pike wrote a bunch
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:12.760]  of stuff. I've read some of his books. He was the founder of the clan, the head of the Masons.
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:17.160]  He admitted he worshiped Lucifer. He's one of these guys Washington warned us about,
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:21.800]  and then he did talk about world wars, bringing in world government, and that's the globalist plan.
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:25.160]  So for a hundred years, we've been hearing about this letter. Whoever said this a hundred years
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:29.560]  ago knew what they were talking about regardless. You see what I'm saying? Exactly. You're so right
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:33.400]  on that, Alex. It's good to finally talk to you again. Thank you. God bless you, John. Thanks
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:36.840]  for holding to bring up those points. We're going to come back from break. I'm making a lot of calls
[02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:42.440]  today. We're going in order of who's been holding the longest, Victor, and then Frank, Carlos, Mike,

[02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:35.160]  after, quote, the truth has come to light in, quote, according to a statement from the company.
[02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:40.440]  Brown said in a statement Monday morning that he was wrong to pursue the matter and used the media
[02:05:40.440 --> 02:05:45.560]  to perpetrate the story. He went on to apologize to Whole Foods and its team members for questioning
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:51.960]  their commitment to values. Brown's apology came after Whole Foods released a video debunking Brown's
[02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:56.360]  story. You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:19.880]  scientists and the answer is clear. Iodine is key, is paramount and there's still so much new
[02:07:19.880 --> 02:07:25.560]  information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it. In our quest for the purest iodine
[02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:31.640]  we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple blue crystals to extract the ultra pure
[02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:37.240]  iodine. On top of that we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling. It is the purest,
[02:07:37.240 --> 02:07:41.880]  cleanest, strongest out there. Quite frankly I'm flattered that with the launch of survival
[02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:46.760]  shield nace and iodine that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors
[02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:51.480]  to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we
[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:59.000]  have. It is exclusive to infowarslife.com and the info wars life family of incredible products.

[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:07.400]  things 2016 and trump but there's a story out of politico trump hires polster tony fabrizio
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:12.520]  and just from stone he points out that this is a fellow that's worked with him and
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:20.600]  and paul manford and then and they recruited him and that uh he's a good guy a really good
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:25.640]  guy and it's a win for trump and then another little bird was telling me about how cori luandowski
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:34.840]  wanted kelly and conway former cruise polster fabrizio was ran pols polster fabrizio is a
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:42.840]  libertarian he's a street fighter and he's a winner so a lot of the inside folks from the

[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:11.320]  pixie and and then you say uh where do you buy your shoes are like i love that joke or it's like
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:15.720]  calling somebody and saying is your refrigerator running and they say yes you say why don't you
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:25.560]  catch it hey uh i heard a great call on friday the 13th on my local talk radio here uh now the host
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:30.360]  promotes info wars has been for over a decade he never really says anything about you or what you
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:36.840]  talk about he just says info wars but uh anyway he's he's been kind of i don't know me he's strange
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:44.200]  he's like really pro agenda on this uh transgender in the bathrooms here in north carolina which is
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:48.840]  you know a major issue here in north carolina right now well my issue is i'm going to be honest
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:52.600]  i'm going to be honest a lot of my really conservative christian friends i'm christian
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:57.080]  but but i mean i don't hate people if it's concerning adults doing something i'm not
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:00.840]  obsessed with that a lot of folks are obsessed with it you know kind of have some issues latent
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:05.640]  you know desires but i don't like all these radical leftists attaching it to that agenda
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:10.040]  and trying to teach it to kids that's sexualizing children it's the state trying to get away with
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:15.720]  anything and then there's no debating that so so that's why i'm upset about it go ahead well a
[02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:20.760]  call or called in it's about 20 minutes maybe 15 20 minutes in the third hour three hour show
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:25.640]  on uh friday morning and the call or just i i did i missed the first part i didn't hear his name
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:29.720]  and i haven't gotten the chance to get on the internet yet to listen to the call but the call
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:34.760]  just blew it blew me away and blew i think blew the host away the host did not handle the call
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:40.280]  the guy was very articulate he spoke like an attorney he you could tell he was he was a a
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:48.600]  conservative uh a patriot and he was not a cuck servitive i mean this guy he was very articulate
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:52.920]  very smart you could tell he's probably probably more than likely was very educated sure so tell
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:58.280]  me what he said i want to hear it he's willing to stand up and fight but he said look this is
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:07.560]  way bigger than you know uh basically uh defending or standing up or some perceived oppressed uh
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:13.160]  you know minority uh this is much bigger than that but i i can't do i can't do it justice
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:17.720]  and i like i said i was sitting in traffic and a lot of distractions but i mean what did he say it
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:24.440]  was about uh i mean he sounded like he was he was he sounded like an import guy he sounded like uh
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:29.000]  you know he might be a listener or something for you what is it about it's clearly about federal
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:33.800]  control it's about giving us faux rights because we're taking our real rights it's about dividing
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:38.760]  people and it's about sexualizing children to confuse their gender identity it's a whole move
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:42.760]  to absolutely infertility in this country which is their admitted plan i lay it all out in my
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:49.480]  film made nine years ago this is what they're doing is there any way people i can i can i
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:53.960]  give some information out where if you know you got millions of just you know i don't care if radio
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:57.640]  shows get plugged where people say where something was that i'm not one of those guys i don't really
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:02.600]  screen calls so you want to say i was listening to this show and they said this that's fine anyway
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:09.480]  it's it's friday the 13th it's a third hour of show it was uh the last caller in the first half hour
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:16.120]  of the show uh is about 15 20 minutes into it he let him talk for about 10 to seem like 10
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:23.560]  okay what was the show so people can find it okay it's called the teeth larson show l a r s o n

[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:41.240]  is get somebody to grab it or you put it on youtube media you think's interesting magnify it
[02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:46.360]  if millions of patriots start taking media that they think's important and magnifying local media
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:51.000]  it becomes national it becomes global media that's what i originally did going back 20 years ago was
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.480]  was it just local i broke that stranglehold and i would cover different local stories from around
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:59.720]  the country that normally wouldn't be a national platform that's what drudge does as well before
[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:05.560]  i did and that's where it's all that i appreciate your call uh let's go ahead take another one here

[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:32.440]  but uh i just you know without you and your show and my brother bringing me uh bringing the attention
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:38.920]  to your show uh to me i should say uh it just helped me and i purchased a bunch of your products
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:43.800]  thank you sir see i want to thank you we're all in this together i mean i'm talking about stuff
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:48.840]  you're waking up you're supporting us thank you sir i want to thank you no problem no problem
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:54.200]  and uh you know i i want to talk also i just want to mention to everyone that's listening
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:59.720]  we need to get out there uh in cleveland and we need to show up and we need to show support for
[02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:06.280]  trump because if if we don't show up you know those freaking uh social justice warriors are
[02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:11.640]  going to be there by the thousand so we need to make sure that we're out there and uh absolutely
[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:16.200]  patriots are always too busy working taking care of their families we're not grandstanders but this
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:21.480]  country's in crisis everyone that can be needs to be in cleveland at least one or two of the days
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:24.840]  and believe me we're gonna outnumber the communists and the socialists and the soros people
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:29.800]  and uh don't worry you know uh the local government knows what scum they are so they're
[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:33.400]  going to be definitely been a rock in a hard place we're going to be peaceful but we're going to be
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:36.760]  there making sure they don't try to steal this election and again i don't like bernie sanders
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:42.440]  but they're stealing it from him he's really the winner so it's just it makes me upset that they
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:47.800]  would steal elections in front of us and try to act like it's normal it's crazy glad that you
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:51.960]  mentioned that because i i talked to a lot of people and as i said i'm an immigrant that's why
[02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:57.240]  i said that because i you know i come from dominica republic and every latino pretty much every
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:02.200]  latino that i talked to that is my friend or just you know someone that i i need because i'm wearing
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:06.760]  my hillary for prison t-shirt uh they're always like you know who are you voting for i'm like
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:14.440]  you know if i could vote because i can't i'm not a citizen i'm legal i'm legal um i would vote for
[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:19.800]  trump and i try to advise everybody and they just look at me like i got three heads and it's like
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:25.960]  you know it's the mainstream media spewing out all their lies as you as you know you know six
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:33.000]  percent approval and it's just it and i just try to slowly chip away it's kind of like it kind of
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.720]  brings you down when you see so many of your friends literally like the walking dead zombie
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:45.000]  seriously that's how it is it it makes you kind of like man like but i still keep pushing you know
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.560]  you you got to kind of you know plant the seed and hopefully it you know it'll grow on its own
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:56.520]  well i totally and absolutely agree with you that's what it comes all down to and it's we the people
[02:17:56.520 --> 02:18:00.920]  that start the new trends it's it's it's we the people that take action and the system tries to
[02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:05.800]  counterfeit it or twist it or take it over but if we just wake up and say no to this it's it's
[02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:11.720]  came over and yes young people historically are where a lot of change comes from there's a lot of
[02:18:11.720 --> 02:18:17.880]  great young people that end up saying no to things in the power structure they they think are wrong
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:22.040]  so starting in the fifties really the power structure started targeting the young people
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:28.520]  with fake revolutions and fake counterculture stuff that they could steer and control to
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:36.280]  break down society and so now the young people are some of the most dumbed-down disconnected folks
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:41.320]  and they absolutely believe mainstream pop tv is real they don't watch news they get their news
[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:48.360]  from sitcoms dramas comic books which are all just spewing globalism and multiculturalism and all
[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:53.400]  this social justice warrior trash and they show up at college as a freshman they're bullied on
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:57.720]  you know their first meeting to be part of the social justice warriors they're led into the club
[02:18:57.720 --> 02:19:02.600]  and now they feel like they're part of a gang and they're very very sad people but we shouldn't
[02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:07.720]  just laugh at them we should really reach out to them and try to warn them about the hoax that's
[02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:13.480]  taking place i mean you can go to info wars.com and get the video it's also on drudgereport.com
[02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:19.640]  the right hand side red linked like let me just show folks right now you can go there and you
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:24.520]  can see on the right hand side where it's red linked flashback bill clinton talking like trump
[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:30.760]  on immigration and show that to him and say do you understand that mexico puts you in jail
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:37.080]  for six months to a year forced labor and beats you up if you're caught illegally there i mean
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:43.480]  it's incredible they make southwest airlines flying into cancun land the exact minute they say or
[02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:48.200]  they'll turn the flight back they tell them the only place in the world when the flight can take
[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:52.520]  off from the us i mean if you're not there 30 minutes before they don't let you on the plane

[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:23.560]  obsess over the last 20 years on air about turning your television off putting your phones away and
[02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:29.320]  getting out in nature getting out in the forest how essential that is and that's why the feds are
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:33.080]  trying to shut down all the forest and the lands and trying to tell people not to be in them and
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:37.320]  harassing people at national parks incredibly rude incredibly hateful in most areas now
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:42.840]  and then even city parks other areas because they want you inside the house bombarded by
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:48.760]  radiation and television and their message is their false reality they admit this is the plan
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:52.040]  that's why they arrest parents all over the country when their 11 or 12 year olds are playing
[02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:57.720]  in the backyard or across the street the park wash them posts that will now tell you about it

[02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:14.680]  they invented it doctors 200 years ago said get out get sunlight take a walk in the woods
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:22.360]  they call it forest bathing maybe the wash them posts will tell us about breathing and give it
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:29.960]  a name like bringing in the air loving the atmosphere over thousands of years of human
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:34.280]  history we have effectively become an indoor species oh we have it that's only the last 50 years
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:39.320]  particularly for those of us trapped in the cubicle life often the only times we regularly
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:45.640]  step foot outside is for our daily work commute or to run errands yeah i live in a neighborhood
[02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:51.800]  by a big green belt and stuff and i'm telling you no one is on it no one no one
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:59.400]  and i had some lady asked me once aren't you afraid you'll get mugged there's no one around
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:04.120]  there it's safe it's just there's some people have been total mental ill fear
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:14.040]  here but again that they panic oh my gosh for the woods by great in 2001 a survey sponsored
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:18.280]  by the us environmental protection agency found that on average americans for 87 percent of their
[02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:24.040]  time indoors and six percent in an enclosed vehicle however a number of scientific studies
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:28.040]  emphasized we've been talking about lately that reveal the great outdoors promotes human health
[02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:35.560]  oh what spending time in natural environments has been linked to lower stress levels what
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:42.280]  improved working memory and feeling more alive among other positive attributes like having
[02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:47.720]  windows that even look out on trees helps in an effort to combat of course yes i've seen
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:52.920]  the white house science are wanted laws passed he wrote white paper saying ban people that say
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:58.760]  you need 30 minutes of sunlight a week he wants you arrested he doesn't want you to have that sun
[02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:05.560]  no no no brain damage sets in depression but cast you look at a photo of cast unseen like
[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:10.600]  a hyper predator man people say that's crazy to want to control reality and say the sun is evil
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:17.480]  but if he can conquer the sun he's conquered earth see it's about you outrageously following
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:24.120]  his edict just like carol rove said he controls reality we put up cast unseen on screenplays a true
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:30.280]  wolf and never to combat our indoor epidemic and reap these health benefits a growing number of
[02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:36.600]  americans have become followers of a japanese practice called shinri yuku coined by the japanese
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:41.160]  ministry of agriculture forests and fisheries in 82 the word literally means and translates to
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:48.440]  you taking in the forest atmosphere or forest breathing cast unseen i'll probably say it hurts
[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:54.040]  you and refers to the process of soaking up the site smells and sounds oh man i can't wait to
[02:27:54.040 --> 02:28:01.480]  get in the forest i go for nighttime walks out of the moon too and refers to the process of
[02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:08.600]  soaking up the site smells and sounds of natural setting to promote psychological and physiological
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:15.480]  health what you got to do is you got to be up safe you know treks and stuff but you ought to climb
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:20.840]  hills and mountains at night when the stars are out and you know go out to state park national park
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:26.680]  it's nighttime and then nighttime go up a big big hill you know safe route up a mountain get up
[02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:31.640]  there on the top and it's just you're up there and the wisp of clouds and the moon with stars and

[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:08.520]  doesn't have the same effect when it's all bound and tied to other garbage is what the
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:11.960]  chemists tell me and all i know is other stuff didn't do this it's it's amazing and you fund

[02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:21.720]  because i was gonna do it after this break but it's just it's right there you need sunlight
[02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:28.040]  by the way you will die from too much sunlight you will die without it and the study show you'll
[02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:34.840]  die quicker with no sunlight then you'll die to get too much okay bare minimum 30 minutes
[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:39.080]  cross your full body once a week is the minimum that's why everybody gets so sick of the winter
[02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:46.120]  is the main reason is not just indoors there's no sun your vitamin d3 runs out in a month you've

[02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:40.520]  carl orph isn't it his orchestra and it's uh carina barana i'm not pronouncing that wrong is
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:45.000]  that correct am i guessing this correctly i don't know i recommended to be put in here a while back
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:48.200]  okay that's what it is good great part right here listen to this
[02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:50.200]  this
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:56.680]  listen to this on your headphones while you're walking through the forest
[02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:03.800]  i don't really ever listen to music when i'm walking around the forest though i've done it before
[02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:11.640]  you know what's really fun go out in the forest at night when there's not even moonlight and just
[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:16.600]  sit there about 20 minutes till your night vision kicks in and then all of a sudden your instincts
[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:25.640]  kick in you realize you're the predator you're not domesticated anymore your eyes are gleaming in the
[02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:31.640]  dark now as a kid my dad used to get me up about three thirty in the morning we eat breakfast and
[02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:37.000]  stuff and then he purposely have us walk about a mile two miles sometimes further
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:41.720]  to a big big ranch so you have that luxury out in these texas through the woods to the pierce
[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:46.840]  stand and by the time you got there and your overalls and stuff you'd be sweating even if it was cold
[02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:51.960]  and it's just it's just good to turn you on and switch you on because you got in a car and
[02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:55.160]  drove out to a dirt stand you know you'd be half asleep and you got there and fall asleep
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:35:01.160]  but you wouldn't be if you walked a couple miles in the dark people don't do that they don't do
[02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:07.080]  what humans always did before it's just it's just crazy and that's what's therapeutic and the system
[02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:11.720]  knows that so that was an exciting article that we covered earlier i'm a couple a few more calls
[02:35:11.720 --> 02:35:17.320]  and get back into the news the story just went up on info wars dot com from kit daniels trump
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:24.680]  hires libertarian for campaign former rand paul polster tony februzio joins trump 2016 so that is
[02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:30.360]  a good sign right there i want to get him on the broadcast in fact uh stone was telling me three
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:34.840]  months ago to get februzio on the show he's never got around to it so he'll be busy and hard to get
[02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:42.040]  on now but nico let's get him on so that is certainly exciting on that front uh right now
[02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:48.920]  let's go back to your phone calls he's been holding the longest here that would be carlos

[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:24.920]  if they're 25 or 70 they look like hell and of course the study show three flu shots doubles

[02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:19.720]  more clear than ever that that things are are just going down the drain and and the things being stolen
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:25.560]  the election just it's all it's all rigged i mean come on like i don't understand well let me show

[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:38.200]  article another one by our prolific kit dangles info wars dot com may 17 2016 today socialism
[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:45.720]  bernie sanders wife bankrupt college forcing its closure bernie pushes free college while his wife
[02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:50.920]  bankrupt school burlington college was took on heavy debt during the tenure of bernie sanders
[02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:55.400]  wife was closing down that's why the banks love socialists the closure of liberal arts college
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:38:00.600]  vermont was blamed directly on jane sanders who bankrupt the school as president from 04 to 011
[02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:05.560]  founded the 72 as an informal gathering of students burlington college grew to a small
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:10.840]  regionally accelerated liberal arts college by the financial strain and academic probation
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:15.480]  created by the ambitious but ill-fated expansion under then president jane sanders onto a new
[02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:19.960]  campus a prime waterfront led the school's demise the burlington free press reported
[02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:24.120]  the guy didn't have a paying job till he was 40
[02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:33.720]  you got big corporations and hundreds of billions of dollars they're the ones funding
[02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:38.440]  socialism was there exempt from it all right let me get back to your calls i really need to get to
[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:44.280]  the stacks of news i've mentioned but haven't hit yet i need to cover it uh let's go ahead and talk
[02:38:44.280 --> 02:38:50.200]  to frank louis again frank you're on the air thank you for calling all right i have just uh two quick
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:55.400]  question enough to make a quick state but uh i have one that the globe is in their algorithms
[02:38:55.400 --> 02:39:00.680]  they have that they can have a superpower as the united states so they're gonna try to bring us down
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:05.880]  we know that and my two questions is trump now that he's come to the forefront i think in their
[02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:11.160]  algorithm he's the number two obstacle that they face uh for completing their plan and uh
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:16.600]  uh do you think that they're going to pull the trigger on us before rather than later now or
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:23.560]  later because of trump and my second question do you think we'll even have a 2016 election
[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:31.000]  with all the things going on they know that trump is a manifestation of rising nationalist
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:36.920]  free market populism so rising nationalist free market pop populism is what i would call this
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:43.720]  phenomenon and so trump is one of the same their fear of the public whether he's real or not and
[02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:49.560]  i think he's real but we'll see the manifestation and his popularity is real and that the media's
[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:53.880]  full attack can't defeat him shows they're out of bullets and so yes i think they're gonna
[02:39:53.880 --> 02:39:58.680]  accelerate their program because it's a good 10 years behind or more and they're taking the
[02:39:58.680 --> 02:40:03.800]  gloves off now because everything else hasn't worked through desperation uh so we are having
[02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:09.320]  victories but it's also very dangerous and the big fight is just now starting and so i would say
[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:15.160]  they could do anything to disable us i mean bringing five million radical jihadists out of war zones
[02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:19.480]  into europe and letting them rape and murder whoever they want is hardcore and they're set the
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:27.560]  same thing up here so war with russia economic collapse false flags blamed on us uh race wars
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:33.320]  being started i mean the sky's the limit they got everything primed up and they've got a
[02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:36.840]  handful of really nasty cards to play uh and so
[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:44.920]  intellectually i'm concerned in my gut i'm concerned what do you think well i'm just
[02:40:44.920 --> 02:40:49.720]  concerned too because they have so many trigger points they could get in you know the middle east
[02:40:49.720 --> 02:40:55.640]  you know kim jong-dong we got so many things they could do and the the illness of these guys is
[02:40:55.640 --> 02:41:01.800]  just it's just beyond my comprehension and i'm for trump i'm my whole form and i hope that they
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:07.000]  can make it through this thing and survive it uh but i don't know i don't think that the
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:13.320]  real republic out there uh or is really uh in tune to what's how close we are for this thing to
[02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:19.320]  explode on us brother you're on target and they're so upset that our founders laid down the second
[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:24.440]  amendment and other things like that like the first amendment that are such obstacles in their way
[02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:29.320]  but they just seem to think they can run through it and they're going to push and push and push and
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:33.400]  i guess try to have a civil war where we destroy the local government the local police if they're
[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:37.240]  dumb enough to follow orders and then and then they defeated both their enemies and i just
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:41.800]  needed to reach out the police the military and and just till they're flooded with information
[02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:45.160]  which they are now so they understand exactly what's happening so they don't go along with this
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:50.440]  because they are destroying this country if they aid the globalists in bringing in a true occupational
[02:41:50.440 --> 02:41:56.280]  force i mean this is this is like joining the nazis if you were french in 1940 1941 uh great

[02:47:33.320 --> 02:47:38.600]  i'll narrate when he's playing with jihad videos video up on info wars dot com muslim scholar
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:44.200]  celebrates extinction of blue-eyed blonde-haired germans germans in the meetings celebrate and
[02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:51.960]  applaud you you cannot make this stuff up the stories up on info wars dot com uh here it is
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:58.600]  islam scholar lamb yorkado said on german television that being german in future will
[02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:04.040]  not mean having blonde hair and blue eyes but being a migrant and wearing a hijab
[02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:11.480]  that i don't know if you're gonna find that they're going to be in an immigration
[02:48:11.480 --> 02:48:15.960]  background in the future this is what's going on in germany in the future
[02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:22.680]  or she doesn't have to wear a biggie pursuit though she's one of the controller females
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:26.920]  being german also means wearing a hijab having dark hair this is what german means today
[02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:36.280]  hey of course she's the germans applaud yes killers as a german audience applauded the erratic
[02:48:36.280 --> 02:48:41.000]  that's sick woman their own people because supporting the extinction of your own race is
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:46.920]  far less of a burden than god forbid being called a racist kado was responsible for publishing the
[02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:53.720]  first german translation of the koran for children and adults she also introduced islamic education
[02:48:53.720 --> 02:48:59.880]  in german public schools this was such a huge success that it led to five of her students
[02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:07.000]  traveling to syria to join isis leftists and muslim celebrating the demographic suicide of a nation
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:12.680]  is a common theme green party politician stefanie von berg said it was a good thing that germans
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:20.760]  would become a minority in major cities our society will change our city will change radically
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:26.440]  i hold it in 20 30 years that will longer be german majorities in our city look it's all
[02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:31.160]  women in power too splitting their own country's throat and i will make it very clear especially
[02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:37.320]  towards these right wingers who is all run by women i had also gave a speech in which he asserted
[02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:43.080]  that muslim should use the migrant crisis to breed with european citizens and conquer their
[02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:47.880]  countries by taking advantage of the fact that europeans have lost their fertility
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:52.840]  we will give them fertility we will breed children with them
[02:49:55.880 --> 02:50:01.240]  because we shall conquer their countries this german politician gregor geissi implied that
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:07.000]  germans who opposed the migrant influx were nazis and that it was good the nazis didn't have many
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:11.960]  children because of our history between 35 and 45 we are obliged to treat refugees properly
[02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:18.920]  the refugees almost all joined hitler by the way oh and by the way every year more native germans
[02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:23.640]  died than they were before that's very fortunate it's because the nazis are not good at having
[02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:29.080]  offspring this decline of germans is why we showed deep in the immigration agenda behind
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:36.200]  multiculturalism is revealed there is no multi in multiculturalism this is about big government
[02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:41.880]  and islamists working together to bring in millions of muslim migrants who will then vote
[02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:48.120]  for more big government the complete decimation of the host culture and the freedoms and prosperity
[02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:55.400]  that came with it is a small price to pay oh lots and another devastating report on info wars dot

[02:56:52.920 --> 02:56:57.720]  his audience is patriot he knows they're waking up he knows where his bun is buttered and so that's
[02:56:57.720 --> 02:57:02.280]  why we build it they will come we don't put up with globalist garbage they won't spew it because
[02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:07.960]  no one will go along with it it's like it's like katalan in spain 87 percent or whatever it was 89
[02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:12.280]  percent i forget the number it's like the hi eighties voted for a secession spain may be able
[02:57:12.280 --> 02:57:16.360]  to block it a few years but they'll never stop it you can't block it when 80 percent of people

[03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:42.680]  mission too what happens when the unmovable object comes into contact with the unstoppable force

[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:25.560]  i actually caught that before the show and it's enraging and i'm coming more and more to the
[03:01:25.560 --> 03:01:30.280]  conclusion that these people cannot be reasoned with and i don't like what's going to happen to
[03:01:30.280 --> 03:01:35.640]  europe in the future because these people they're laughing now but they're not going to be laughing
[03:01:35.640 --> 03:01:41.000]  when enough people get you know get pissed off and decide to uh take action that won't be pretty for
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:46.040]  them and i'm afraid that's going to happen here too with the burning people sure sure it's a form
[03:01:46.040 --> 03:01:51.160]  of self-mutilation which is on the rise the more decadence society becomes the more self-mutilation
[03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:55.720]  increases and when you bring in third world populations that are incompatible and giggle
[03:01:55.720 --> 03:02:01.400]  about it it's it's like full grown adults it's popular now to wear diapers yeah you know so it's

[03:02:18.440 --> 03:02:23.480]  so yesterday you had tosh ponleon uh it occurs to me that if we know that there's a maneuver going
[03:02:23.480 --> 03:02:29.400]  on if the robber barons have got some op that's moving and we know about it maybe we ought to
[03:02:29.400 --> 03:02:35.480]  start spreading the word even more and maybe think about getting people out there uh blocking the
[03:02:35.480 --> 03:02:39.080]  roads or that's a good idea they listed the marine corps base when they've got the weapons it's all
[03:02:39.080 --> 03:02:43.400]  slated to ship to the drug cartels and the diocesan people blown the whistle folks have been

[03:09:15.880 --> 03:09:21.960]  to roll out self-driving cars self-driving trucks what you're seeing at our airports just understand
[03:09:21.960 --> 03:09:28.920]  that's just a prelude to complete control of our transportation it's the tsa is not the airport
[03:09:28.920 --> 03:09:33.640]  security administration they are the transportation security administration we told you about this for
[03:09:33.640 --> 03:09:37.800]  years told you about the viper teams that they would roll out the bus stations or set up road
[03:09:37.800 --> 03:09:44.680]  blocks at various places they are going to use technology folks to do a complete control grid
[03:09:44.680 --> 03:09:48.280]  on our transportation anyone know what it's going to look like it's going to be the worst aspect so
[03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:54.120]  the dmv and the tsa they're going to combine that together they're going to make it virtually
[03:09:54.120 --> 03:09:59.960]  impossible for you to travel and they're going to take over cars they're going to make it impossible
[03:09:59.960 --> 03:10:03.480]  for you to own a car they're going to make it very difficult for you to travel they will control
[03:10:03.480 --> 03:10:09.000]  all access they will tax you they will track you they will force you into the cities and that's
[03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:13.640]  what this report we're going to talk about here there if you've seen the report that Rob Jacobson
[03:10:13.640 --> 03:10:21.880]  and I did about Obama's land grab via executive order using an ancient misusing I should say
[03:10:21.880 --> 03:10:27.960]  an ancient antiquities act to take over these monuments the first time it was used was
[03:10:28.680 --> 03:10:33.400]  they took two acres and it was a very familiar landmark that you've all seen and
[03:10:35.240 --> 03:10:40.520]  the Spielberg film Close Encounters okay that only took two acres
[03:10:40.520 --> 03:10:47.320]  and devil's tower I had to think about what that was but now they're out there taking millions of
[03:10:47.320 --> 03:10:50.840]  acres and doing it all over the place even extending they're going to be extending it was
[03:10:50.840 --> 03:10:56.520]  announced at the end of the week the Grand Canyon uh taking parts of that but they're not really
[03:10:56.520 --> 03:11:03.160]  protecting property in Arizona that they set apart that truly was about Indian history Indian
[03:11:03.160 --> 03:11:08.040]  religion and recreation if people want to talk about that so first I want to tell you about the
[03:11:08.040 --> 03:11:11.640]  and we'll go to our caller Jeremy in California I want to tell you what happened with the rancher
[03:11:11.640 --> 03:11:17.800]  today this is a story on new american Wyoming rancher fights the feds and wins he's been freed
[03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:24.200]  from millions of dollars in EPA fines now this is two years ago this is a rancher Andy Johnson
[03:11:24.200 --> 03:11:29.880]  he was in Wyoming the guy had eight acres eight acres he's not a wealthy rancher you don't have
[03:11:29.880 --> 03:11:34.840]  to hate him because you think he's wealthy I can tell you the bundies are not wealthy the ranchers
[03:11:34.840 --> 03:11:40.600]  out there not wealthy they work really hard but you think that everybody's been cart right if you
[03:11:40.600 --> 03:11:45.480]  live in the cities okay not the case these guys work really hard and they deserve every penny
[03:11:45.480 --> 03:11:52.440]  they get but this is a guy he's not even a rancher he's a welder he had eight acres out in Wyoming
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:58.200]  and for those of you who are living in 200 square foot apartments that is not a lot of land especially
[03:11:58.200 --> 03:12:03.960]  if you're living out in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming so this is a welder he builds a pond on his
[03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:09.240]  property he went through all the local and state permits had absolutely no problem they gave him
[03:12:09.240 --> 03:12:15.080]  permission and then for some reason after the fact the EPA came in and said uh you know what
[03:12:15.800 --> 03:12:20.440]  we've got an issue with that and we want you to shut this down and it's like well I'm not really
[03:12:20.440 --> 03:12:24.280]  sure that you've got jurisdiction here it's not a problem with anything this is a swimming
[03:12:24.280 --> 03:12:29.960]  fool for my kids I've got a couple of cows some livestock here they're using it to drink from
[03:12:29.960 --> 03:12:38.200]  them so the EPA came in and said no we're going to shut this down we own all water in the country
[03:12:38.200 --> 03:12:43.000]  there's not just the water that's crossing state lines not just the large rivers and streams no
[03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:49.720]  you build a pond on your private property the EPA says they can control what you do with your
[03:12:49.720 --> 03:12:53.800]  private property even if it's just a pond that you construct on your property so they came after him
[03:12:53.800 --> 03:12:59.960]  with excessive fines as prohibited in the Constitution remember that remember there's
[03:12:59.960 --> 03:13:06.680]  prohibitions of excessive fines and that is a prohibition even after you've been found guilty
[03:13:06.680 --> 03:13:13.080]  of a crime no they put the excessive fines on you before they find you guilty of anything
[03:13:13.080 --> 03:13:19.720]  they're coming after him for $37,500 a day a guy who's a welder has eight acres and put a little
[03:13:19.720 --> 03:13:28.280]  pond on it they tried to find him $37,500 a day why not $37,501 I mean it's totally arbitrary
[03:13:28.280 --> 03:13:34.280]  totally excessive totally unconstitutional illegal and criminal but that's our EPA that's the out of
[03:13:34.280 --> 03:13:39.880]  control unaccountable federal bureaucracy that we have and they even tried at one point to garnish
[03:13:39.880 --> 03:13:45.880]  his wages they're going to leave the man penniless just like the IRS does when they say that you owe
[03:13:45.880 --> 03:13:51.480]  them money without due process and then you have to prove your innocence say that's the way they
[03:13:51.480 --> 03:13:57.080]  operate they treat him as if he was some kind of a racketeering and influence corrupt organization
[03:13:57.080 --> 03:14:02.040]  where you got to steal the money first so the person can't defend themselves in court and
[03:14:02.040 --> 03:14:07.560]  completely destroy their lives well first the EPA was slapped down somebody with some sense
[03:14:07.560 --> 03:14:13.400]  somewhere said no you can't garnish his wages this is a fine you haven't found him guilty of
[03:14:13.400 --> 03:14:19.800]  anything he hasn't had any due process now they have gone back and the lawyers who have represented
[03:14:19.800 --> 03:14:26.520]  him have worked out a deal with the EPA and I guess that's a victory but you know when I look
[03:14:26.520 --> 03:14:33.240]  at this I don't really feel like it's a victory in the sense that they give him conditions on
[03:14:33.240 --> 03:14:38.440]  what he has to do they say on one part of it he's he's got to plant willows around the pond
[03:14:38.440 --> 03:14:44.920]  temporarily thick fence off part of it from livestock and so forth it's like no no it's not
[03:14:44.920 --> 03:14:49.320]  your business you don't have any jurisdiction here EPA you don't have any jurisdiction when we
[03:14:49.320 --> 03:14:54.680]  admit that you have jurisdiction here we've lost it's not really a victory that's a victory in the
[03:14:54.680 --> 03:15:01.240]  sense that they've taken these fines away then of course there is no pragmatic reason no practical
[03:15:01.240 --> 03:15:06.040]  reason for why the EPA would do this as part of the fight he went in and he tested water
[03:15:06.040 --> 03:15:11.800]  here before it it came in and came out of his pond and it was actually cleaner after it came
[03:15:11.800 --> 03:15:15.960]  out of his pond but that's not the point doesn't have anything to do with that it has to do with
[03:15:15.960 --> 03:15:22.440]  the fact that they are assuming powers that they don't have and if you want to know just how bad
[03:15:22.440 --> 03:15:28.840]  this is I've got another story here the US Supreme Court this was reported by Reuters I think it was
[03:15:28.840 --> 03:15:37.960]  on a drug rejected a challenge to protest rejected a challenge that on the protest ban that the
[03:15:37.960 --> 03:15:45.560]  Supreme Court has put on their plaza I think about that okay the Supreme Court has banned any kind
[03:15:45.560 --> 03:15:51.960]  of protests anywhere close to the Supreme Court building where they hear cases where they issue
[03:15:51.960 --> 03:15:59.160]  rulings how about that they say they've got a law that they passed and the law has made it unlawful
[03:15:59.160 --> 03:16:05.640]  to quote parade stand or move in processions or assemblages in the Supreme Court building or on
[03:16:05.640 --> 03:16:10.760]  the grounds or to display in the building and grounds a flag a banner or device designed or
[03:16:10.760 --> 03:16:17.080]  adapted to bring into public notice a party organization or movement well gee I thought
[03:16:17.080 --> 03:16:22.440]  I remembered we had a constitution and the very first amendment to the Constitution said Congress
[03:16:22.440 --> 03:16:29.800]  shall make no law oh you got a law saying we can't parade or make assemblies or put up signs or
[03:16:29.800 --> 03:16:37.160]  flags or banners around the the Supreme Court isn't that kind of ironic no no it's criminal
[03:16:37.160 --> 03:16:45.080]  it's criminal the Supreme Court which routinely exceeds its authority and destroys the Constitution
[03:16:45.080 --> 03:16:50.680]  in the name of constitutional review these people are out there saying and remember the
[03:16:50.680 --> 03:16:56.680]  Supreme Court says Congress shall make no law and they talk about suppressing the free exercise
[03:16:56.680 --> 03:17:01.720]  of religion not just your personal beliefs but the exercise of religion the freedom of the press
[03:17:01.720 --> 03:17:09.320]  and then this the right of the people to peacefully assemble to petition their government to redress
[03:17:09.320 --> 03:17:16.120]  their grievances okay Congress shall make no law the Supreme Court shall make no law the Supreme
[03:17:16.120 --> 03:17:21.240]  Court shall have no ban as they're setting their pontificating about how they're going to change
[03:17:21.240 --> 03:17:27.000]  our Constitution they shut down all free speech around the Supreme Court isn't that wonderful
[03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:33.880]  isn't that wonderful that's how deep we are into this that's the insanity that's why we have to
[03:17:33.880 --> 03:17:40.360]  cut off Washington it's too far gone folks it's too far gone uh let's go to Jeremy in California
[03:17:40.360 --> 03:17:46.520]  Jeremy had a comment about the report we done on BLM go ahead yeah yeah David I I just want to
[03:17:46.520 --> 03:17:52.280]  say uh quickly give me a few seconds too sure I am really appreciative of how you have covered
[03:17:52.280 --> 03:17:59.320]  this story I think that you have been uh probably the best in educating people covering putting
[03:17:59.320 --> 03:18:05.480]  Pine Herobrine into everything tying it into Oregon being fair with the Bundy's and I'm hugely
[03:18:05.480 --> 03:18:12.440]  appreciated uh appreciative of that and InfoWars I would like to ask though uh for you to take
[03:18:12.440 --> 03:18:17.960]  it a step further because really I don't know what the difference between say you and Pete
[03:18:17.960 --> 03:18:22.840]  Sanfilly was on the ground in Nevada just two different mic flags and two different approaches
[03:18:22.840 --> 03:18:27.800]  but the truth is is that you were on the front lines David and that there could be an indictment
[03:18:27.800 --> 03:18:36.280]  for you and so my question is is two twofold one would you and if Alex is listening right now Alex
[03:18:36.280 --> 03:18:43.000]  would you send David to go interview Pete Sanfilly in jail and cover him and cover an alternative
[03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:49.560]  media figure two would you please at a minimum have his uh partner and co-host Deb Jordan
[03:18:50.120 --> 03:18:55.720]  on for an interview about the entire situation because let me let me tell you Jeremy you know
[03:18:55.720 --> 03:19:00.280]  maybe like you said you weren't there uh you weren't there at either one of these events we
[03:19:00.280 --> 03:19:05.320]  were there both of the events and I can tell you we tried very hard to try to talk to M and Bundy
[03:19:05.320 --> 03:19:10.360]  in the Oregon situation and it was Pete Sanfilly who was running interference for that so you know
[03:19:10.360 --> 03:19:15.000]  we were able to talk to Levoie Finnecombe when he came out front my son interviewed him uh we've
[03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:19.240]  got somebody else or with a voice of Idaho that I've talked to who's now been arrested on a weapons
[03:19:19.240 --> 03:19:23.320]  charge I don't know if that's legitimate or not I've seen all kinds of trumped up charges and the
[03:19:23.320 --> 03:19:29.560]  indictment against the Bundy's I'm far more interested about the Bundy's I think that is a
[03:19:29.560 --> 03:19:35.720]  far more interesting case and when we look at what happened with the Bundy's they are
[03:19:35.720 --> 03:19:41.800]  entrapping the Bundy's using what this reporter did and I have a real problem with that because I
[03:19:41.800 --> 03:19:46.840]  don't believe that he acted strictly as a reporter I believe that he entrapped the Bundy's with what
[03:19:46.840 --> 03:19:51.080]  he did and that's what you see in the indictment there's a lot of lies in that indictment but
[03:19:51.080 --> 03:19:57.080]  what they're doing is they're saying he was their spokesperson and if he made threats against officers
[03:19:57.080 --> 03:20:01.000]  that was coming from Clive and Bundy I don't think that's true stay with us we'll be right back

[03:25:23.240 --> 03:25:28.280]  when we first introduced it i want to go to uh north carolina before we do and i want to see if
[03:25:28.280 --> 03:25:34.440]  mark has a comment on this because i just saw this story today ben and jerry's is creating a new flavor
[03:25:35.400 --> 03:25:40.040]  to promote voting rights in north carolina along with the n double acp
[03:25:41.160 --> 03:25:46.520]  now they say that uh they want to protest against and i don't see anything about the new flavor
[03:25:46.520 --> 03:25:52.200]  of ice cream i don't know what they're going to call it um they say ben and jerry's has created
[03:25:52.200 --> 03:25:56.280]  a new ice cream flavors part of new campaign with north carolina n double acp to highlight voting
[03:25:56.280 --> 03:26:01.960]  rights to get money and to get money out of politics they're going to have a press conference today i
[03:26:01.960 --> 03:26:07.400]  guess that's when they'll tell us what they're going to call it well i would suggest i got some names
[03:26:07.400 --> 03:26:11.800]  i could come up with that are a bit rude but you know what here's the problem they want to say that
[03:26:11.800 --> 03:26:15.640]  there isn't any problem in north carolina used to live in north carolina used to vote in north
[03:26:15.640 --> 03:26:20.200]  carolina i would walk in they would just ask me for my name they would look it up on their
[03:26:20.200 --> 03:26:24.760]  address list and hand me something they wouldn't verify my identity whatsoever and i can tell you
[03:26:24.760 --> 03:26:30.360]  when i have told you back in 2012 my brother-in-law told me that a friend of his went in and said i went
[03:26:30.360 --> 03:26:36.120]  to vote and they said well you've already voted says no i haven't says yes you and this other
[03:26:36.120 --> 03:26:41.000]  person at your address and they gave him the name he goes that's my mother she died several years ago
[03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:46.680]  and so well you're both have voted already you can't vote and i said i want to talk to this guy
[03:26:46.680 --> 03:26:51.320]  wanted to come on the show he wouldn't come on the show he didn't protest and so it didn't happen
[03:26:51.320 --> 03:26:57.000]  you know what people get raped and they don't file charges sometimes okay so just because
[03:26:57.000 --> 03:27:01.080]  they haven't seen these things happen doesn't mean that it hasn't happened i know for a fact
[03:27:01.080 --> 03:27:05.960]  that it has happened and when you make fraud available to people and you say we're not going
[03:27:05.960 --> 03:27:12.440]  to look at your driver's license how is that an intimidation that is a civil rights issue how is
[03:27:12.440 --> 03:27:16.680]  that intimidating black people anymore than it's intimidating anybody else it doesn't intimidate
[03:27:16.680 --> 03:27:21.240]  people people are asking you for your identity all the time why shouldn't you have to show your
[03:27:21.240 --> 03:27:26.040]  driver's license or some kind of a photo id in order to vote so they can verify that you are who
[03:27:26.040 --> 03:27:31.240]  you say you are there's absolutely nothing discriminatory about that and there are many
[03:27:31.240 --> 03:27:35.560]  states that do it all over the country and yet they focus on north carolina because they have
[03:27:35.560 --> 03:27:39.240]  a different issue that they want to bring this and let's go to uh mark in north carolina you
[03:27:39.240 --> 03:27:45.880]  said stealing the election go ahead yes sir uh you know we talked about stealing the uh
[03:27:45.880 --> 03:27:49.480]  election you know through the primaries what have you you know for the with the delegates and what
[03:27:49.480 --> 03:27:54.120]  have you uh what are your what are your thoughts about instilling the election you know after
[03:27:54.120 --> 03:27:59.480]  say it's filary and trump and the electoral college gives filary the president my understanding
[03:27:59.480 --> 03:28:05.960]  that electoral college is supposed to vote the way their state and their yeah that brings up a
[03:28:05.960 --> 03:28:10.920]  brings up an issue doesn't it you know we have we started playing these semantic games when we
[03:28:10.920 --> 03:28:15.000]  would have elections and we'd say well you know trump got this many delegates and crews got that
[03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:19.160]  many delegates and then they come back and say oh no crews took over trump's delegates it's like
[03:28:19.160 --> 03:28:24.200]  what you know that's a first isn't it you know the reality is is that these electoral college
[03:28:24.200 --> 03:28:30.120]  delegates can switch their vote as a matter of fact it happened once we have uh uh it's kind
[03:28:30.120 --> 03:28:35.880]  of a little bit of a historical trivia that the very first woman who ever got an electoral vote
[03:28:35.880 --> 03:28:43.080]  for vice presidency was a libertarian party candidate tony nathan and she was the vp candidate on a
[03:28:43.080 --> 03:28:49.240]  presidential campaign and there was a guy his name was roger mcbride he was a republican
[03:28:49.240 --> 03:28:55.240]  delegate to the electoral college i forget where it was from uh he was also uh descended uh from
[03:28:55.240 --> 03:28:58.680]  the people that did little house on the prairie that was his mother grandmother something anyway
[03:28:58.680 --> 03:29:05.240]  he was a producer and uh he went to the electoral college and instead of voting for whoever it was
[03:29:05.240 --> 03:29:09.320]  i don't know if it was reagan or whoever he voted for the libertarian and of course that was the
[03:29:09.320 --> 03:29:13.720]  end of his republican involvement when he did that but here's the reality you can do that
[03:29:13.720 --> 03:29:20.360]  okay so people can do that at these conventions the delegates can switch their votes and i have a
[03:29:20.360 --> 03:29:25.000]  problem i don't know how you feel about it mark but i have a problem when i vote for somebody and
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:28.840]  they get awarded the delegates like trump did and then they say well they're not going to be loyal
[03:29:28.840 --> 03:29:33.640]  to trump they're not going to support trump bud how do you feel about that well you know i feel
[03:29:33.640 --> 03:29:39.480]  like i think that my college was put in there to keep the power with the rich you know with the
[03:29:39.480 --> 03:29:43.800]  people with the money okay well yeah we'll talk about that there's there's problems with anything in
[03:29:43.800 --> 03:29:48.840]  terms of its implementation we come back i'll talk briefly about why i think the electoral college
[03:29:48.840 --> 03:29:56.120]  is still a good idea stay with us the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:00.200 --> 03:30:05.960]  the military has turned to a directed energy frequency jammer mounted on an assault rifle

[03:33:11.160 --> 03:33:14.840]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david i we're gonna go to our callers that are on hold
[03:33:14.840 --> 03:33:19.160]  in just a moment uh before we do i want to finish up with what i was talking uh the question that
[03:33:19.160 --> 03:33:23.560]  the last caller we had uh mark in north carolina asked about the electoral college what good is
[03:33:23.560 --> 03:33:29.480]  it he says well there is a good reason to have it even though like anything else look we need to
[03:33:29.480 --> 03:33:33.560]  have a constitution or some kind of a legal structure for our government we need to have
[03:33:33.560 --> 03:33:38.040]  a bill of rights even if the government ignores it subverts it as i was talking about with the
[03:33:38.040 --> 03:33:43.240]  supreme court so yeah the idea behind the electoral college is a very simple one and it's a better
[03:33:43.240 --> 03:33:52.600]  idea than simply having direct democracy if we go to just a overall vote what's going to happen if
[03:33:52.600 --> 03:33:59.720]  if you've got corrupt areas like chicago rigging and stuffing the ballot they could wipe out in
[03:33:59.720 --> 03:34:05.320]  a large city like that they could wipe out the votes of entire states and so the whole point
[03:34:05.320 --> 03:34:11.560]  of the electoral college was to give some kind of power to the states remember the states created
[03:34:12.120 --> 03:34:16.280]  the federal government they are not creatures or subdivisions of the federal government
[03:34:16.280 --> 03:34:21.640]  they created the federal government in the same way that unfortunately we had nation states create
[03:34:21.640 --> 03:34:27.160]  the united nations what if the united nations at some point which they will comes out and says
[03:34:27.160 --> 03:34:31.000]  we're going to dissolve the nation states we're going these things are obsolete we've already
[03:34:31.000 --> 03:34:35.480]  got people who talked about it yesterday on the fourth hour talked about on the nightly news last
[03:34:35.480 --> 03:34:41.880]  night this guy writing op-ed pieces in the new york times as a former and current cfr guy council
[03:34:41.880 --> 03:34:47.640]  informed relations saying we need to get over these this antiquated structure of 50 states and we
[03:34:47.640 --> 03:34:53.880]  need to go with regional organizations we need to reorganize within the united states and across
[03:34:53.880 --> 03:34:58.440]  international boundaries between the united states and canada for example create a detroit
[03:34:58.440 --> 03:35:02.680]  windsor region okay they're talking about a north american union they're talking about
[03:35:02.680 --> 03:35:07.560]  dissolving the states because they said well we don't need to have these these states of subdivisions
[03:35:07.560 --> 03:35:12.920]  of this federal government and not even a federal government of the north american union but look
[03:35:12.920 --> 03:35:19.080]  going back to the constitution and where this is all coming from the states created the federal
[03:35:19.080 --> 03:35:23.320]  government the states wanted to make sure that they had some say so that there was a division
[03:35:23.320 --> 03:35:29.480]  of power the thing that they feared the most was a concentration of all power in the federal government
[03:35:29.480 --> 03:35:34.280]  and so that's why you had things like the ninth amendment like the tenth amendment that's why
[03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:40.520]  you have the electoral college the electoral college gives a certain number of votes to each
[03:35:40.520 --> 03:35:45.480]  state and then those electors go and so it's basically a winner take all state by state and
[03:35:45.480 --> 03:35:51.320]  then you have some sort of regional representation that way that was the purpose of it and of course
[03:35:51.320 --> 03:35:59.560]  the delegates can go rogue and they can vote however they wish but any system can be subverted
[03:35:59.560 --> 03:36:05.000]  and i'll give you a an example of what happens and i've mentioned this once before in the county
[03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:13.960]  where we lived they used to have county commissioners appointed by each region and so you'd have a
[03:36:13.960 --> 03:36:20.280]  geographical distribution of these county commissioners and each geographical area of the county
[03:36:20.280 --> 03:36:25.320]  would elect a county commissioner and it was a very rural county a lot of the people had
[03:36:25.320 --> 03:36:31.160]  been there many generations farming the land and then they had people from a nearby university
[03:36:31.160 --> 03:36:38.760]  community very liberal start come into this county and they started it was a large concentration of
[03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:44.760]  people in one corner of the county and they said well we want to get rid of the geographical
[03:36:44.760 --> 03:36:50.440]  election of county commissioners and we want to elect them at large that means that everybody in
[03:36:50.440 --> 03:36:57.640]  the county gets the same slate of people regardless of where you live what happened was these people
[03:36:57.640 --> 03:37:04.040]  that had the concentration of population in the northeast corner of the county elected all
[03:37:04.040 --> 03:37:08.440]  of the county commissioners they all came from that little area and they all had an idea they
[03:37:08.440 --> 03:37:13.160]  had an idea that they were going to tell these people who had farms everything that they could
[03:37:13.160 --> 03:37:18.120]  and could not do with their land even though they'd had it for generations and so that's what's
[03:37:18.120 --> 03:37:23.320]  going to happen on a national level if you get rid of the electoral college yeah it's not a perfect
[03:37:23.320 --> 03:37:28.520]  system but it is a far better system than direct democracy than direct election because you're
[03:37:28.520 --> 03:37:33.560]  going to have these urban centers who are ready because things are set up on a proportional basis
[03:37:33.560 --> 03:37:39.080]  by population they already have a disproportionate say in the election they are going to have the
[03:37:39.080 --> 03:37:44.440]  entire election if you go to that and of course tomorrow we've got another election in Oregon
[03:37:44.440 --> 03:37:49.720]  and Kentucky people are saying hey it looks like Bernie Sanders is going to have two more victories
[03:37:49.720 --> 03:37:57.480]  and however however in Kentucky there are strong institutional roots among the Democrats to support
[03:37:57.480 --> 03:38:01.480]  Hillary Clinton I know that's really kind of interesting you know this article that we got
[03:38:01.480 --> 03:38:06.680]  up on info wars.com from the LA Times Hillary Clinton keeps losing so how come she's winning
[03:38:06.680 --> 03:38:11.240]  with the delegates you know look people say there's no difference between the Democrats
[03:38:11.240 --> 03:38:15.160]  and Republicans well that's simply not true there's a very clear difference between the
[03:38:15.160 --> 03:38:21.640]  Democrats and Republicans the Democrats steal the nomination before the election and the Republicans
[03:38:21.640 --> 03:38:27.000]  steal the nomination after the election they do it at the convention at the brokered convention
[03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:31.160]  the Democrats steal it before the election with the super delegates and that of course
[03:38:31.160 --> 03:38:35.960]  is what they've been doing and if you go back and you look at what they did with these super
[03:38:35.960 --> 03:38:41.000]  delegates I remember the last election we had I think it was West Virginia yeah West Virginia
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:48.760]  okay Hillary beat uh Hillary lost to Bernie Sanders he beat her 51 to 36 big spread there right
[03:38:48.760 --> 03:38:53.800]  except it's not a winner take all and they do everything proportionally so they got the
[03:38:53.800 --> 03:38:59.960]  delegates divvied up proportionally but he still didn't win okay when I first saw it reported
[03:38:59.960 --> 03:39:05.640]  they had it at the end of the night they said well it's 1717 now that isn't that interesting
[03:39:05.640 --> 03:39:09.320]  and the only reason that's happening is because the super delegates are already there for Hillary
[03:39:09.320 --> 03:39:14.680]  Clinton she gets about 10 to 12 percent of the delegates out of all these states are super
[03:39:14.680 --> 03:39:19.800]  delegates so he has to beat her by far more than 10 percent which he did he beat her by
[03:39:20.680 --> 03:39:25.720]  about 15 percent but they still wound up getting about the same number of delegates and here's
[03:39:25.720 --> 03:39:30.440]  what's even more interesting is the way it was reported as I said that night I took a screenshot
[03:39:30.440 --> 03:39:37.080]  of it I tweeted it out said look at this 1717 is the way CNN is reporting it in terms of delegates
[03:39:37.080 --> 03:39:44.680]  even though the spread is 51 36 and then the next day it shows up as Sanders having 18 and
[03:39:44.680 --> 03:39:48.680]  Clinton having 11 it's like how'd she lose six delegates it's like well you know what's going
[03:39:48.680 --> 03:39:53.720]  on they decided the next day to make it look better they wouldn't report the super delegate
[03:39:53.720 --> 03:39:59.240]  total so when you get the super when it all the dust settles out and they allocate all the delegates
[03:39:59.240 --> 03:40:06.600]  and they give her the super delegates out of that state it wasn't 1717 it wasn't 18 to 11 it was
[03:40:06.600 --> 03:40:13.080]  19 to 18 so he beats her by 15 percent and he gets one more delegate than she gets
[03:40:13.720 --> 03:40:20.760]  and he's not going to win she is only 143 away from the magic number that she needs to
[03:40:20.760 --> 03:40:27.480]  have a majority that's 50 plus one and that's only 143 delegates they have a lot more delegates
[03:40:27.480 --> 03:40:30.680]  in the democrat party than they do in the republican party it's like two different currencies
[03:40:32.360 --> 03:40:35.080]  they have about twice the number of delegates those are doing the republican party so that
[03:40:35.080 --> 03:40:40.040]  would be equivalent to saying that Trump only needed about 60 or 70 delegates in order to seal
[03:40:40.040 --> 03:40:45.000]  up the election it's going to happen and so you know they yeah there's a difference in the way
[03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:51.000]  that they rigged the election how they set this up she started out before the election even began
[03:40:51.000 --> 03:40:55.800]  she started out 15 percent of the way there with super delegates who had already pledged to her
[03:40:55.800 --> 03:40:59.400]  and when I was in North Carolina I tried to interview a guy who was a Bernie Sanders supporter
[03:40:59.400 --> 03:41:05.000]  at the university there and he was very upset had put some stuff out on Facebook talking about how
[03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:11.720]  they had tried numerous things that have been sabotaged by democrat party operatives in the
[03:41:11.720 --> 03:41:16.200]  state of north Carolina they kept trying to organize things and things kept getting shut down
[03:41:16.200 --> 03:41:21.800]  or other things would happen and his suspicion was that these people were doing things for
[03:41:21.800 --> 03:41:25.240]  Hillary Clinton even though they were supposed to be working for Bernie Sanders they were doing
[03:41:25.240 --> 03:41:31.080]  things for the Clinton organization because they were career democrats and they knew where their
[03:41:31.080 --> 03:41:35.400]  bread was going to be buttered in the future and they were going to play along with the system and
[03:41:35.400 --> 03:41:40.600]  so that's the way that works let's go to uh Debra in Ohio you also want to talk about the money
[03:41:40.600 --> 03:41:50.360]  ranch go ahead Debra hi how are you today doing good good I'm glad to hear listen um you know
[03:41:50.360 --> 03:41:58.920]  usually I'm not a caller I'm not someone who calls in but I I did want to get something um off my
[03:41:58.920 --> 03:42:07.480]  mind here because it's really been bothering me um and and it's about your coverage of of uh
[03:42:07.480 --> 03:42:13.000]  and not about your coverage it doesn't matter whether you cover it or not um and that is the
[03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:19.320]  subject of Pete Santelli I am his co-host and and I want to tell you something Mr. Knight
[03:42:19.960 --> 03:42:27.560]  and and I love the work that you do uh actually Pete has called you an American hero on on our
[03:42:27.560 --> 03:42:32.360]  show many many times well that's not what he was saying at the Bundy ranch quite frankly uh you
[03:42:32.360 --> 03:42:38.600]  know I hear one thing and I see another thing and you know I quite frankly this is you know what this
[03:42:38.600 --> 03:42:44.200]  is about a lot of things that he's tried to make himself at the center of all this and this is I
[03:42:44.200 --> 03:42:50.600]  think a key issue of the problem and I'm just not interested in talking about him and building him up
[03:42:50.600 --> 03:42:54.680]  that seems to be what he's doing and he's gotten himself and a lot of other people and a lot of
[03:42:54.680 --> 03:43:00.280]  trouble by making himself the center of the issue so that's really all I've got to say about it and
[03:43:00.280 --> 03:43:07.720]  if you want to keep calling me about it the issue here is land is not a reporter somewhere okay it's
[03:43:07.720 --> 03:43:13.400]  about land it's about it out of control government and when anybody makes themselves a story that
[03:43:13.400 --> 03:43:17.640]  changes the whole dynamic and I'm not interested in talking about that I mean we've got other people
[03:43:17.640 --> 03:43:21.960]  who are in trouble I'm far more interested in talking to the Bundy's themselves I'm far more
[03:43:21.960 --> 03:43:27.560]  interested in talking to Ammon and others and basically a lot of those lines of communication
[03:43:27.560 --> 03:43:32.920]  appear to have been burned by a guy who made himself the center of everything when I first
[03:43:32.920 --> 03:43:39.400]  went there he said hey I'm the liaison between alternative media and and and the government
[03:43:39.400 --> 03:43:44.200]  I'm not alternative media I don't need a liaison I talk to people that I want to talk to when I want
[03:43:44.200 --> 03:43:49.560]  to talk to them I don't need anybody's permission to do it nobody represents me and he didn't
[03:43:49.560 --> 03:43:56.200]  represent them and if he did it was very foolish on their part let's go to our next caller Rob in
[03:43:56.200 --> 03:44:06.360]  New York go ahead Rob it's night yes how you doing today very good go ahead okay so I the reason for
[03:44:06.360 --> 03:44:12.280]  my call in David is that I wanted to pass along an article for you guys so that way you could
[03:44:12.280 --> 03:44:18.680]  potentially really use this I think it's very interesting it has to do obviously with Mr.
[03:44:18.680 --> 03:44:25.720]  Zuckerberg and the virtual reality glasses that are coming out if I could is there a
[03:44:26.680 --> 03:44:33.000]  email that I could send this to maybe sure send it to me at David K at info wars.com
[03:44:33.000 --> 03:44:39.160]  you're talking about Oculus Rift right yep basically I've seen the pictures of people
[03:44:39.160 --> 03:44:45.960]  sitting there you know crowds of people with these giant goggles on and you know it it truly is
[03:44:45.960 --> 03:44:50.680]  literally becoming like the matrix and I've I've tried them on myself it's a very impressive thing
[03:44:50.680 --> 03:44:55.000]  and and it's a very dangerous thing too you know we need to understand just as we talk about
[03:44:55.000 --> 03:44:59.880]  technology just because you can build something doesn't mean you should do we talked about that
[03:44:59.880 --> 03:45:04.600]  and we talked about synthetic DNA the other day talked about it on Sunday the fact that they could
[03:45:04.600 --> 03:45:08.680]  construct children designer children wherever they want to do it and there's a picture you can see
[03:45:08.680 --> 03:45:12.680]  pull up there they pulled up a picture of this crowd of people sitting there wired into the
[03:45:12.680 --> 03:45:16.680]  matrix literally you know when we're talking about scientists and we say just because they can
[03:45:16.680 --> 03:45:23.160]  construct a human being from scratch and they can build a super soldier that they can then program
[03:45:23.160 --> 03:45:29.960]  and control after the program it from birth and program from before birth they shouldn't do it just
[03:45:29.960 --> 03:45:34.120]  because you can do something doesn't mean you should do it and just because something is entertaining
[03:45:34.120 --> 03:45:40.520]  and engaging like this virtual reality Oculus Rift I think we need to understand the dangers
[03:45:40.520 --> 03:45:45.880]  the dangers involved in it I mean this is something that has a potential to be like a drug to people
[03:45:45.880 --> 03:45:51.560]  because it is so engaging and so just as I don't support drug prohibition because I don't think
[03:45:51.560 --> 03:45:58.200]  it works I also don't support drug use okay I don't use drugs I don't drink and I think it's a
[03:45:58.200 --> 03:46:03.480]  wise thing to just abstain from some of these things that can really suck you in can waste your
[03:46:03.480 --> 03:46:10.520]  life destroy your time and make you helpless and dependent your comments Rob that that's the beauty
[03:46:10.520 --> 03:46:19.000]  of this article David is that the inventor and founder palm palm or lucky was actually caught
[03:46:19.000 --> 03:46:27.320]  in a suspicious ring of burglaries due to this and and one of the golden points I'm not going to
[03:46:27.320 --> 03:46:33.720]  take up too much more time but one of the golden points is at the end when the police said when
[03:46:33.720 --> 03:46:41.080]  asked how he exactly or when he knew exactly when the victims were using VR lucky simply stated
[03:46:41.080 --> 03:46:46.840]  were owned by Facebook wow wow yeah send me that article I'd like to see that sounds like a great
[03:46:46.840 --> 03:46:51.480]  article thank you for passing that on let me go quickly to John and Wyoming John go ahead
[03:46:51.480 --> 03:46:58.920]  hi David hi can you hear me yes you're on go ahead okay you're right on the electoral college
[03:46:58.920 --> 03:47:05.800]  issue because look Wyoming is the least popular state in the union we have about 568,000 people
[03:47:05.800 --> 03:47:13.080]  California on the other hand has well over 38 million so right now they have 55 electoral votes
[03:47:13.080 --> 03:47:20.040]  and we have three so they outnumber us 18 and a third to one however if we went to a direct
[03:47:20.040 --> 03:47:28.680]  democracy they would outnumber us 67.4 to one exactly the founding fathers gave us the electoral
[03:47:28.680 --> 03:47:35.800]  college to protect the rural areas from the excesses of big cities and big populated states in the
[03:47:35.800 --> 03:47:42.520]  northeast exactly the whole point yeah electoral college is there to protect our vote not to destroy
[03:47:42.520 --> 03:47:47.560]  it and not only just to protect a rural interest against urban interest but to protect state
[03:47:47.560 --> 03:47:53.400]  interests because it was the states that created the federal government they were sovereign states
[03:47:53.400 --> 03:47:57.560]  at the time they created the federal government and they wanted to make sure that they did not lose
[03:47:57.560 --> 03:48:03.720]  that sovereignty they gave limited powers to the federal government and they made it very very clear
[03:48:04.280 --> 03:48:09.640]  and the ninth and the tenth amendment they said if we don't explicitly give you these powers you
[03:48:09.640 --> 03:48:14.200]  don't have them and we have to enumerate anything that we give you it has to be enumerated very
[03:48:14.200 --> 03:48:19.960]  specifically that's why we have an amendment that said that they had the power to prohibit alcohol
[03:48:19.960 --> 03:48:24.440]  but now they prohibit everything unless it's expressly permitted and that includes prescription
[03:48:24.440 --> 03:48:29.320]  drugs not just things like marijuana where is the amendment to prohibit marijuana or to prohibit
[03:48:29.320 --> 03:48:34.280]  some prescription drug they never did it they just assumed the power in the same way they said we're
[03:48:34.280 --> 03:48:40.440]  going to pass an amendment to have an income tax and yet now we're told that the unconstitutional
[03:48:40.440 --> 03:48:44.600]  mandates to purchase insurance are simply a tax well that's not that wouldn't be constitutional
[03:48:44.600 --> 03:48:50.440]  either and so yeah they ignore the constitution but that's the whole point was to keep the power
[03:48:50.440 --> 03:48:54.360]  at the states one of the things that they did of course one of the amendments that they did that
[03:48:54.360 --> 03:48:58.680]  helped to destroy the division of power and when we talk about this folks i know that
[03:48:59.400 --> 03:49:03.560]  when you talk about states having power it triggers people it's like you're talking about
[03:49:03.560 --> 03:49:08.280]  states rights therefore you're talking about racism and slavery no we're talking about a
[03:49:08.280 --> 03:49:14.360]  division of power power was supposed to be divided to keep it from being consolidated they all
[03:49:14.360 --> 03:49:19.080]  understood the greatest danger was the consolidation of power as i pointed out yesterday when i
[03:49:19.080 --> 03:49:25.640]  played the eight points from boris johnson former mayor of london who is advocating that britain
[03:49:25.640 --> 03:49:29.880]  leave the european union he said here's eight reasons why we should leave and most of those
[03:49:29.880 --> 03:49:34.600]  reasons were the same reasons that we've seen here abused in the united states too much consolidation
[03:49:34.600 --> 03:49:40.600]  of power money is going away from us power is flowing away from us everything is going into
[03:49:40.600 --> 03:49:46.760]  a distant government that we have no say so we have very little control over if any and we don't get
[03:49:46.760 --> 03:49:52.200]  to make the decisions locally the better the government the more local the government or the
[03:49:52.200 --> 03:49:57.080]  more local the better the government should put it that way if government is local is more easily
[03:49:57.080 --> 03:50:01.960]  controlled you look at a situation like new hampshire they have more representatives there the largest
[03:50:01.960 --> 03:50:06.600]  legislative body that they have anywhere in the world and i remember a few years ago i guess it
[03:50:06.600 --> 03:50:11.800]  well a few years ago 20 years ago 25 years ago when the libertarian party we had four libertarians
[03:50:11.800 --> 03:50:19.160]  got elected into the house at one point of uh new hampshire and they said yeah if you spend more
[03:50:19.160 --> 03:50:23.240]  than a thousand dollars trying to get elected to the new hampshire house at the time you're accused
[03:50:23.240 --> 03:50:28.200]  of trying to buy the election it's like wow because in north carolina at the time they were spending
[03:50:28.200 --> 03:50:33.800]  about $50,000 to get elected to the legislature because that's where the corruption comes in
[03:50:33.800 --> 03:50:40.760]  you give people power the money will flow to that power you're not going to do you've been in jerry
[03:50:40.760 --> 03:50:46.040]  in the NAACP say well you know we want to get money out of politics anything we'll get the power
[03:50:46.040 --> 03:50:52.120]  out of politics and the money will go somewhere else the problem is is that we've got too much power
[03:50:52.120 --> 03:50:58.600]  concentrated into one place and like a black hole it is sucking all of the life and the light and
[03:50:58.600 --> 03:51:03.880]  the oxygen out of everything else we'll be right back your life with extendivite a seven herb

[03:54:18.120 --> 03:54:23.320]  Ryan which I think needs to be fleshed out before we go back to that and before I go back to Dave
[03:54:23.320 --> 03:54:27.960]  and South Carolina hang on there Dave just want to let you know that we have some of the products

[03:55:25.320 --> 03:55:31.240]  as well it is now back in stock as well I want to go to our caller Dave in South Carolina
[03:55:31.240 --> 03:55:36.520]  real quickly but before I do I just want to mention this in this bill from this this article
[03:55:36.520 --> 03:55:44.280]  about the senate bill allowing 9-11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia I have a comment from Paul Ryan
[03:55:44.280 --> 03:55:48.520]  he says I think we need to look at it I think we need to review it because we need to make sure
[03:55:48.520 --> 03:55:54.680]  we're not making mistakes with our allies and we're not catching people that shouldn't be caught up
[03:55:54.680 --> 03:55:59.880]  in this and I said it created a rare area of agreement between GOP lawmakers and the White
[03:55:59.880 --> 03:56:06.200]  House it's like no it's not rare Paul Ryan agrees with Obama on the borders he agrees with him on
[03:56:06.200 --> 03:56:11.160]  the trade issues that were the trade deals that were written by multinational corporations without
[03:56:11.160 --> 03:56:18.680]  any input from our legislators he's going to oppose Donald Trump Paul Ryan will more than he
[03:56:18.680 --> 03:56:23.560]  opposes Obama I can guarantee that it's one of the reasons why he needs to be primaried out
[03:56:24.280 --> 03:56:28.360]  he's got a primary coming up in August and we need to make sure that he doesn't return to the
[03:56:28.360 --> 03:56:33.320]  house because he is going to be the biggest obstacle a president Trump would face he agrees
[03:56:33.320 --> 03:56:40.680]  with Obama on all of these issues and we talk about we don't want to unjustly come after our
[03:56:40.680 --> 03:56:45.240]  allies I've got this article we don't have time to talk about from the Guardian I'll talk about
[03:56:45.240 --> 03:56:52.840]  tonight on the nightly news this lady talking about the 50 lashes that her husband got he was
[03:56:52.840 --> 03:56:57.960]  sentenced to a thousand lashes he's gotten the first 50 nearly killed him he's been sentenced to
[03:56:57.960 --> 03:57:03.880]  10 years in prison and a thousand lashes what was his crime well he blogged about things
[03:57:03.880 --> 03:57:08.840]  and insulted Islam quote through electronic channels according to the Saudi government
[03:57:08.840 --> 03:57:14.760]  this government that cuts off more heads than ISIS does is our closest ally these are the people
[03:57:14.760 --> 03:57:24.040]  that Paul Ryan and Obama are protecting trying to keep their involvement in 9-11 quiet absolutely
[03:57:24.040 --> 03:57:31.720]  criminal let's go to Dave in South Carolina Dave go ahead David I really appreciate what you bring
[03:57:31.720 --> 03:57:38.200]  to Alex's organization on a daily basis it's a fantastic addition we've only got about a minute
[03:57:38.200 --> 03:57:44.200]  go ahead in principle with your voter discrimination thing but technically I will disagree in that
[03:57:44.200 --> 03:57:50.520]  voter identification is to be discriminatory but not against race but against those who are not
[03:57:50.520 --> 03:57:57.960]  legitimate voters it is designed to protect the system to be discriminatory yes yes exactly yeah
[03:57:57.960 --> 03:58:02.360]  there are some legitimate forms of discrimination we forget that you know when Obama says we can't
[03:58:02.360 --> 03:58:07.800]  discriminate against people when we rent to them in case they're felons you know what if you have as
[03:58:07.800 --> 03:58:12.440]  government convicted somebody of murder and rape and then you turn them out and say well I think
[03:58:12.440 --> 03:58:17.320]  they're all better now I think I have a right to discriminate against what that person has done
[03:58:17.320 --> 03:58:21.160]  that you have certified that that person has done because you put them in prison and then you
[03:58:21.160 --> 03:58:26.440]  released them I need to know that information and we can discriminate against people based on what
[03:58:26.440 --> 03:58:47.800]  they do that's not wrong to do that join us tonight 7 central 8 p.m. eastern for the info wars nightly news
