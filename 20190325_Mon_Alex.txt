[00:00.000 --> 00:17.600]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:17.600 --> 00:18.600]  the Infowar.
[00:18.600 --> 00:25.520]  I am surprised if, for example, this week on Friday he is going to be delivering what
[00:25.520 --> 00:27.720]  I think are going to be his indictments, the final indictments.
[00:27.720 --> 00:31.320]  I would not be surprised if there were a number of indictments that still were going to come
[00:31.320 --> 00:32.520]  down the pike.
[00:32.520 --> 00:35.960]  There are indictments in this president's future.
[00:35.960 --> 00:36.960]  That's a bombshell.
[00:36.960 --> 00:37.960]  The bombshell.
[00:37.960 --> 00:39.680]  This bombshell dropped the bombshell.
[00:39.680 --> 00:41.160]  Bombshell accusation.
[00:41.160 --> 00:42.160]  Bombshell accusation.
[00:42.160 --> 00:46.280]  This is evidence of willingness to commit collusion.
[00:46.280 --> 00:52.760]  This BuzzFeed News report is true, then we are likely on our way to possible impeachment
[00:52.760 --> 00:53.760]  proceedings.
[00:53.760 --> 00:57.280]  If this story is true, we must begin impeachment proceedings.
[00:57.280 --> 00:58.280]  This is subwarning perjury.
[00:58.280 --> 01:01.280]  I think there's no question it's an impeachable offense.
[01:01.280 --> 01:05.920]  And at that point we are in high crimes at Mr. Meener and we are in impeachment.
[01:05.920 --> 01:08.920]  This president needs to be impeached.
[01:08.920 --> 01:09.920]  Impeachment is the remedy.
[01:09.920 --> 01:11.120]  I mean, the president can't see this.
[01:11.120 --> 01:12.120]  The only remedy.
[01:12.120 --> 01:15.440]  The spirit of what Trump did is clearly treasonous.
[01:15.440 --> 01:20.480]  This is moving into perjury, false statements, and even potentially treason.
[01:20.480 --> 01:21.960]  There's outright treason.
[01:21.960 --> 01:23.760]  I mean, there is no question.
[01:23.760 --> 01:25.680]  I think he's feeling the noose around his neck.
[01:25.680 --> 01:26.680]  The noose is tightening.
[01:26.680 --> 01:29.480]  And I think they're shocked that the noose is tightening.
[01:29.480 --> 01:30.880]  He feels the noose is tightening.
[01:30.880 --> 01:32.800]  The noose is tightening.
[01:32.800 --> 01:38.240]  The sound of hoof beats of all those investigations catching up with Donald Trump must be loud
[01:38.240 --> 01:39.720]  in his ears.
[01:39.720 --> 01:44.680]  He may be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time.
[01:44.680 --> 01:46.360]  People might go to jail.
[01:46.360 --> 01:47.360]  You're exactly right.
[01:47.360 --> 01:48.360]  For the rest of their lives.
[01:48.360 --> 01:49.360]  I think they're all going to jail.
[01:49.360 --> 01:52.680]  Well, I think they're all going to end up together in prison and maybe that's a good
[01:52.680 --> 01:53.680]  man.
[01:53.680 --> 01:54.680]  Oh my God.
[01:54.680 --> 01:55.680]  You're right.
[01:55.680 --> 01:56.840]  He's going down.
[01:56.840 --> 02:01.800]  You're confident that at least some Trump associates will wind up in jail?
[02:01.800 --> 02:03.200]  If I was betting, I would say yes.
[02:03.200 --> 02:06.200]  Donald Trump Jr. gave us the dots.
[02:06.200 --> 02:09.480]  All we have to do is to connect them to see where this is going.
[02:09.480 --> 02:27.240]  You can hear us right here, you got it, restore the republic, you got it, they launched the
[02:27.240 --> 02:32.680]  economy and the family, you got it, you are a ghost.
[02:32.680 --> 02:51.240]  It's all coming out.
[02:51.240 --> 02:59.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Monday, March 25, 2019,
[02:59.040 --> 03:05.600]  Global Transmission, and folks have made these compilations, the Democrats all going off
[03:05.600 --> 03:10.240]  talking points in the corporate media, regurgitating them about the walls are closing in, no doubt
[03:10.240 --> 03:15.000]  it's treason, he's a Russian agent, but I was thinking just watching that video compilation
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.840]  that's linked up on dredgerport.com, which is an excellent video compilation off the
[03:18.840 --> 03:23.440]  top of my head though, during the break, I'm going to run back, talk to some of the crew
[03:23.440 --> 03:28.440]  and remind them of 10 or 15 clips, I remember, where it was worse than that.
[03:28.440 --> 03:50.680]  I mean, we're going to put the real definitive compilations together because the stuff everybody's
[03:50.680 --> 03:55.040]  put together is powerful until you realize what else there is, it's even worse.
[03:55.040 --> 04:00.000]  We've got all the responses crying and freaking out, but let me break something down here.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.800]  We told you this was all coming.
[04:02.800 --> 04:10.000]  We told you it was fail, but the establishment isn't going to give up yet.
[04:10.000 --> 04:15.040]  We have decisive findings here by major international study groups, by groups that crunch the numbers,
[04:15.040 --> 04:21.920]  top professors, Google and the rest of the big tech is absolutely stealing elections.
[04:21.920 --> 04:26.560]  They beta tested in 2018 and they're going to steal it in 2020.
[04:26.560 --> 04:31.920]  This is the real collusion, this is the real fraud, this is the real meddling.
[04:31.920 --> 04:34.440]  And so we've got to get Trump moving on this direction.
[04:34.440 --> 04:41.000]  He already is going after the brainwashing command bases where they create the cult members,
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.960]  the cadet centers, the nurseries at the university, he's already going after the censorship there,
[04:46.960 --> 04:52.880]  but now he must move, must move decisively against the chai-tom enemy Google.
[04:52.880 --> 05:00.440]  So they're right back, I'm Alex Jones, tomorrow's news today.
[05:00.440 --> 05:05.480]  And now through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[05:05.480 --> 05:09.720]  So far it matches any other special we've ever done, so this is the best deal we've

[05:39.520 --> 05:40.520]  leaders.
[05:40.520 --> 05:43.360]  So I want to thank you all for supporting the Info War, I want to encourage you today
[05:43.360 --> 05:49.600]  to get great products in the 360 win, InfoWareStore.com, voting with our feet, voting with our dollars,
[05:49.600 --> 05:54.240]  voting with our mouths, voting with our speech, voting with our action, free shipping store
[05:54.240 --> 06:13.920]  wide, that's free shipping store wide, free shipping store wide, InfoWareStore.com.
[06:13.920 --> 06:43.880]  So we have written literally hundreds of articles in the last two years about the
[06:43.880 --> 06:50.520]  attempt to de-state criminal takedown of the 45th president of the United States and now
[06:50.520 --> 06:56.960]  the whole criminal operation has been exposed, the emails, the text messages, the premeditation,
[06:56.960 --> 07:03.840]  the fact that Hillary and Obama, when Trump was president-elect, within 48 hours, launched
[07:03.840 --> 07:05.320]  the plan.
[07:05.320 --> 07:12.040]  All of that, ladies and gentlemen, is now coming out in a very, very big way and we have the
[07:12.040 --> 07:21.600]  president of the United States coming out and pointing out that now there needs to be
[07:21.600 --> 07:31.480]  criminal investigations of the individuals and the groups that tried to take the presidency
[07:31.480 --> 07:34.680]  down in an attempted coup d'etat.
[07:34.680 --> 07:40.720]  That's what this is and it sounds extreme to say that but the Democrats admitted that
[07:40.720 --> 07:44.720]  that is what they were doing but first I want to go to Joy Behar because there's been a
[07:44.720 --> 07:49.160]  lot of compilations out there of them celebrating and saying he's a Russian agent and he's
[07:49.160 --> 07:55.640]  going to go to prison and he needs to be killed but none of them have added this little jewel
[07:55.640 --> 08:21.600]  and throughout the day we're going to be playing some of the jewels that people have forgotten
[08:21.600 --> 08:31.680]  about.
[08:31.680 --> 08:37.880]  America was never great, America will never be great from the very same state that these
[08:37.880 --> 08:44.040]  women are sitting up there like vultures on top of 50 story building at the view television
[08:44.040 --> 08:48.200]  platform I've been there.
[08:48.200 --> 08:53.320]  I mean even if it was true he's a Russian agent you would get really upset about your
[08:53.320 --> 08:56.680]  president doing that and think what's going to come of this is going to wreck the country.
[08:56.680 --> 08:58.480]  Of course none of it was true.
[08:58.480 --> 09:01.560]  They're the globalists, the Democrats, the corporate media Hollywood, they're in bed
[09:01.560 --> 09:06.240]  with the chai comms, they're the ones demoralizing the nation constantly saying how much it sucks
[09:06.240 --> 09:11.280]  and how racist we are and how everything's horrible and how we're falling apart and Maxine
[09:11.280 --> 09:17.760]  water saying don't move your factories back here, I'm going to reverse what Trump did,
[09:17.760 --> 09:24.600]  I'm going to bring all of the regulations back into the United States and the economy
[09:24.600 --> 09:29.120]  is going straight up, it's going sideways because the Democrats announced we're not
[09:29.120 --> 09:34.880]  open for business, we all got stuck in China and India and Mexico, we're about mountain
[09:34.880 --> 09:38.720]  America's head on the wall, don't you try to make this country great again, we're going
[09:38.720 --> 09:45.840]  to stop that Russian agent from making the country great again, but while we all celebrate
[09:45.840 --> 09:50.440]  the fact that Mueller came up empty despite all the people they tried to frame, all the
[09:50.440 --> 09:55.400]  illegal spying, all the people they tried to put in jail for made up things to get them
[09:55.400 --> 10:00.400]  to turn against the president and lie, they couldn't get anybody to do it because there
[10:00.400 --> 10:07.280]  was nothing there, even when they got people like Cohen to flip there was nothing for him
[10:07.280 --> 10:11.760]  to connect anything to the president because it was all made up by that dirty criminal
[10:11.760 --> 10:20.600]  and so Balazi Ford's failed, who else has failed, Congressman Schiff has failed, Michael
[10:20.600 --> 10:25.080]  Moore's failed, Hillary Clinton's failed, Bill Clinton's failed, Barack Obama's failed,
[10:25.080 --> 10:34.280]  the globalist has failed, all these people, the list just goes on and on of all the hoaxers
[10:34.280 --> 10:47.360]  and all the liars, McCain has failed, it's incredible what's been going on.
[10:47.360 --> 10:53.200]  Now you have to ask yourself what is going to come next because we can sit here and look
[10:53.200 --> 11:02.920]  at the land and understand the Democrats are not going to ever give up, they've launched
[11:02.920 --> 11:12.800]  their Balazi Ford, they've launched their Stormy Daniels, they've launched their Russia
[11:12.800 --> 11:20.640]  Gate hoaxes and they're going to launch more of them but people now have seen the fact
[11:20.640 --> 11:26.120]  that this is the party of Jesse Schmollett, this is the party of fraud, this is the party
[11:26.120 --> 11:31.600]  of liars, but if Trump thinks he can just now try to get the economy moving forward
[11:31.600 --> 11:35.680]  and that they're not going to come back after him and that he can basically try to be neutral
[11:35.680 --> 11:41.480]  and that hopefully the Democrats become sane, he's made a big mistake, we now must discuss,
[11:41.480 --> 11:51.200]  we now must talk about, we now must debate what needs to be done and justice is always
[11:51.200 --> 11:58.120]  the course and Trump didn't hint at that, he spelled it out when he talked about the
[11:58.120 --> 12:06.400]  fact that there's total exoneration, says illegal takedown failed, Steve Watson article
[12:06.400 --> 12:11.000]  on NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and I would ask you to get that out, people need
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.880]  to hear from the President himself getting on Air Force One yesterday, laying this out
[12:17.880 --> 12:23.680]  and saying it needs to be looked at, how the Democratic Party from Obama right down to
[12:23.680 --> 12:35.640]  Hillary organized this entire operation against the President, here's the President.
[12:35.640 --> 12:45.080]  After so many people have been so badly hurt, after not looking at the other side where
[12:45.080 --> 12:49.520]  a lot of bad things happened, a lot of horrible things happened, a lot of very bad things
[12:49.520 --> 12:58.800]  happened for our country, it was just announced, there was no collusion with Russia, the most
[12:58.800 --> 13:06.680]  ridiculous thing I've ever heard, there was no collusion with Russia, there was no obstruction
[13:06.680 --> 13:17.520]  and none whatsoever and it was a complete and total exoneration, it's a shame that our
[13:17.520 --> 13:23.520]  country had to go through this, to be honest it's a shame that your President has had to
[13:23.520 --> 13:32.680]  go through this before I even got elected, it began and it began illegally and hopefully
[13:32.680 --> 13:40.880]  somebody's going to look at the other side, this was an illegal takedown that failed and
[13:40.880 --> 13:48.440]  hopefully somebody's going to be looking at the other side, so it's complete exoneration,
[13:48.440 --> 13:52.880]  no collusion, no obstruction, thank you very much, thank you.
[13:52.880 --> 13:59.360]  And let's expand on that, now the deep state's scared with big tech, it's openly not working
[13:59.360 --> 14:03.760]  with our military, with our state governments, it's working with the Chinese, the decision's
[14:03.760 --> 14:07.840]  been made, the money's been spent, the transference of power is already happening, but Trump and
[14:07.840 --> 14:13.320]  America and other nationalists around the world woke up at the 11th hour and now it's
[14:13.320 --> 14:17.320]  beginning to reverse and a lot of people were confident in the global system, they thought
[14:17.320 --> 14:21.000]  we were done, now they're not so confident, you're going to see Democrats turn against
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.960]  each other like rats leaving a sinking ship, this is still a very, very dangerous period
[14:26.960 --> 14:33.240]  we're in, but as Trump tweeted out last year, now that Russia collusion is a proven lie,
[14:33.240 --> 14:38.680]  then do the trials for treason begin, yeah you can't leave all these dangerous crooks
[14:38.680 --> 14:42.920]  who are actually in bed with foreign governments walking around because you're now aiding and
[14:42.920 --> 14:49.280]  abetting them if you don't do the right thing and go after them, we're going to go to break
[14:49.280 --> 14:53.240]  or come back with more of these clips and get into the Google censorship, now confirmed
[14:53.240 --> 14:59.400]  that stole the 2018 elections, that top scientists universities crunched the numbers, professors,
[14:59.400 --> 15:03.520]  they did it, and it turns out Google bragged to Hillary they can deliver the election to
[15:03.520 --> 15:10.640]  her, it's just a tsunami was so big of Trump that he barely won, you know he had a landslide,
[15:10.640 --> 15:15.360]  so they miscalculated, now they're openly stealing at levels never foreseen, we're going
[15:15.360 --> 15:18.560]  to go to break, please don't forget through the end of this month, that's how we fund

[19:27.840 --> 19:31.800]  you ready and so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler
[19:31.800 --> 19:36.520]  and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff because God wants
[19:36.520 --> 19:40.880]  warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight, you don't
[19:40.880 --> 19:44.240]  go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back and I mean, I don't
[19:44.240 --> 19:48.320]  know what's going to happen to me in the future, I mean, all I know is I want to go with the
[19:48.320 --> 19:53.800]  master belt, I want to go to the next level, I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced,
[19:53.800 --> 19:58.080]  not these devil worshipers, they're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb, I want
[19:58.080 --> 20:03.040]  life, I want Jesus.
[20:03.040 --> 20:32.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:32.040 --> 20:38.600]  Great sound, the globalists and your new Chai Khan masters have removed President Trump,
[20:38.600 --> 20:44.920]  he was a Russian agent and now America's not going to be great at you, brought to you
[20:44.920 --> 20:50.040]  by Hillary Clinton, she'll bring America to heel.
[20:50.040 --> 21:00.280]  Oh, but that's an alternate reality, we were all told about but it didn't happen, did it?
[21:00.280 --> 21:05.560]  This is a syndicated radio show that also simulcast via television, I started doing
[21:05.560 --> 21:13.560]  that about 18 years ago, I launched streaming the show so that people can actually see what
[21:13.560 --> 21:17.840]  I was talking about because I'd say, oh, I've got a congressional report here that says
[21:17.840 --> 21:22.960]  we're going to hand the entire national park system over to the UN and people wouldn't believe
[21:22.960 --> 21:23.960]  me.
[21:23.960 --> 21:29.880]  So I started simulcasting video and now here we are today so I can show people like this
[21:29.880 --> 21:35.720]  stack of news, document cam shot please, just go to any searches and type in deep state
[21:35.720 --> 21:42.040]  coup against Trump and then put an info wars.com, you'll get hundreds of articles going back
[21:42.040 --> 21:50.200]  to times like May 10th, 2017, you can actually find me on January 20th, 2017 saying that
[21:50.200 --> 21:54.480]  they'd try it and exactly who was running it, they actually funded it, Obama signed an
[21:54.480 --> 21:55.480]  executive order.
[21:55.480 --> 22:02.320]  See, I had the exact blueprint, it wasn't that I was so smart, Obama put a stay behind
[22:02.320 --> 22:07.720]  group, part of the CIA, part of the Justice Department, part of the Ford and Carnegie
[22:07.720 --> 22:11.480]  endowment to unseat the president.
[22:11.480 --> 22:17.120]  Brit Hume last week, why he told Tucker Carlson that, he said yes, there was a deep state
[22:17.120 --> 22:21.880]  national emergency declared through different bodies in the government, they tried to unseat
[22:21.880 --> 22:22.880]  the president.
[22:22.880 --> 22:31.080]  Oh, Brit Hume tells us that two years later, by the way, Brit Hume knew that day one.
[22:31.080 --> 22:34.080]  Back then he was more in the fence about Trump, they thought Trump might be removed but see
[22:34.080 --> 22:38.000]  now, now they failed.
[22:38.000 --> 22:42.960]  Here it is, deep state pushes coup against Trump over Comey firing, that was right after
[22:42.960 --> 22:48.160]  Comey was fired, I laid out exactly what happened, we broke it all down and the videos and articles
[22:48.160 --> 22:53.200]  were posted there and that's why they wanted us taken off in the summer because we were
[22:53.200 --> 23:02.160]  saying everything they were doing and that scared the living daylights out of them.
[23:02.160 --> 23:06.880]  Get him off, get him off, you heard the CEO of YouTube, I wanted to get Alex Jones off
[23:06.880 --> 23:11.080]  and I got him off and now when I get all the other conservatives off, she just admits
[23:11.080 --> 23:22.760]  it on television in front of a huge auditorium of people and they're not going to stop now.
[23:22.760 --> 23:32.680]  They went and made it all up, folks, they had congressional hearings where they said
[23:32.680 --> 23:38.400]  Alex Jones works for the Russians and members of Congress leaned down and they go, I want
[23:38.400 --> 23:46.280]  him off air and they say, sir, we were working on it at lunch, you think let me put the clip
[23:46.280 --> 23:51.920]  skin, imagine you're watching that going, I mean I could be somebody that they found
[23:51.920 --> 23:58.360]  with dead bodies in my basement, I would get to face my accusers but oh, I'm an evil talk
[23:58.360 --> 24:03.080]  show host that has big American flags flying behind me and it's totally for free market,
[24:03.080 --> 24:08.520]  totally for the second amendment, totally for religious rights, totally for sovereignty
[24:08.520 --> 24:18.640]  of a flaming nationalist Americana and I'm the bad guy, it's just imagine the inversion
[24:18.640 --> 24:26.840]  of reality, same thing, same trumps against America, yeah, congressman quickly, I mean
[24:26.840 --> 24:31.720]  there's like 15 hearings you can pull out but the worst are in the armed services committee
[24:31.720 --> 24:38.080]  in the house, I mean it's flat out scary when they've got the military civilians sitting
[24:38.080 --> 24:43.080]  in there, these are people that direct the military to overthrow governments, kill people
[24:43.080 --> 24:48.720]  and break things, lying about you saying you're a traitor, no, let me tell you something,
[24:48.720 --> 24:54.960]  all of you lying scumbags saying I'm a traitor to this country, you're the traitors, oh and
[24:54.960 --> 24:59.880]  here's the good news, I don't want to play it next segment, only play this last week
[24:59.880 --> 25:05.160]  once, I should play it ten times, General Dumford and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
[25:05.160 --> 25:10.320]  and the secretary of defense laying out that to say that Google is taking us over is an
[25:10.320 --> 25:16.120]  understatement and we're totally infiltrated by them and it's treason and Google works
[25:16.120 --> 25:25.400]  for the chicoms, of course, the culture at Google, the culture at major universities,
[25:25.400 --> 25:32.160]  the culture at Evergreen, you and Harvard and Yale and all these places is, America
[25:32.160 --> 25:41.360]  is evil, communism is good, half the millennials in polls say they're communist or socialist,
[25:41.360 --> 25:47.160]  we have cancer, let's admit it and the fact that Dumford has to sit up there and explain
[25:47.160 --> 25:52.200]  that he went and met with Google and met with an auditorium of their employees and said
[25:52.200 --> 25:59.520]  we're the good guys, not the chicoms and it doesn't mean our military or our government's
[25:59.520 --> 26:05.440]  perfect because it can be hijacked and run by people like Barack Obama, that's why you
[26:05.440 --> 26:09.320]  can't let too much power transfer into any centralized system because it always gets
[26:09.320 --> 26:14.680]  abused and the most centralized thing in the world that is the most cutthroat evil that
[26:14.680 --> 26:25.480]  anyone has ever imagined is the Chinese communists by orders of magnitude and our universities
[26:25.480 --> 26:30.680]  are publicly bought off by their confucius institutes and all the rest of it, I've talked
[26:30.680 --> 26:35.040]  to high level folks at the Pentagon, CIA, Naval Intelligence, you name it, but I can do my
[26:35.040 --> 26:39.560]  own research, hell I do this stuff before they were onto it, I'm not bragging, it's
[26:39.560 --> 26:45.280]  like I had Jack Masobyk on who's heavily dialed in and I said what's the order of magnitude
[26:45.280 --> 26:53.280]  that your colleagues that you've come up with used to be in China, used to live there and
[26:53.280 --> 26:59.400]  how much bigger is the Chinese infiltration of the United States compared to Russia?
[26:59.400 --> 27:07.440]  I said 50%, 100% he goes now a thousand percent because when the Russians try to buy you off
[27:07.440 --> 27:13.040]  they go would you like to be in business with us, would you like Russia, that's not China
[27:13.040 --> 27:18.200]  does it, they make you give all your technology, all your codes, everything to them, they make
[27:18.200 --> 27:22.800]  you move over to China, they usually make you marry a Chinese woman who's got family
[27:22.800 --> 27:26.760]  over there, they'll kill if you don't play ball, they were wondering why so many tech
[27:26.760 --> 27:31.480]  heads who are really gay have a Chinese wife and Chinese kids because they've made the
[27:31.480 --> 27:36.400]  deal folks and by the way if you don't know about that, that's the olden days, back when
[27:36.400 --> 27:41.720]  two kingdoms would merge they'd make their kids marry or it wasn't a real alliance, like
[27:41.720 --> 27:47.280]  our grandkids are going to be the same and this two hundred year war is about to end.
[27:47.280 --> 27:55.360]  So I'll explain this, China is absorbing us, we're not merging with China, we're being
[27:55.360 --> 28:01.680]  eaten by China and now right as we were the last parts of us were going into the Chinese
[28:01.680 --> 28:09.120]  dragon's mouth, the American eagle is trying to fly out of there and it's flapping its
[28:09.120 --> 28:14.160]  wings and it's almost getting out of there and the Democrats are panicking like no, our
[28:14.160 --> 28:21.880]  whole ethos is hating America, don't any Democrat event, I always knew they hated America, I
[28:21.880 --> 28:28.360]  knew some of them did but I've gone to Democrat events and they'll be like Alex get out of
[28:28.360 --> 28:34.000]  there boo boo boo when the events called it, Donald Trump, Alex Jones and the age of fake
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.920]  news, they have a big public event downtown Austin, block the streets, I show up and they're
[28:38.920 --> 28:43.800]  booing me but as soon as I said America's back you'll never stop it, they literally
[28:43.800 --> 28:49.080]  started going, ah, get out and people started running up going I like to have sex with kids
[28:49.080 --> 28:52.760]  and licking my face and hitting me and I looked into the bleachers and the people were just
[28:52.760 --> 28:59.840]  flopping around like.

[33:25.040 --> 33:42.400]  this is alex jones.
[33:42.400 --> 33:49.400]  When I don't know where they come from, what they show you come, I won't be coming for
[33:49.400 --> 33:56.800]  free, and I don't know how they do it, but they show it to me, I won't get you for free.
[33:56.800 --> 33:59.560]  All right folks, we're going to come back in the next segment, I'm going to be able
[33:59.560 --> 34:05.520]  to digest this and comment on it, but just during the break, I'll start looking at news
[34:05.520 --> 34:10.000]  articles, collecting things from the producers, and they said, hey, this is broken like the
[34:10.000 --> 34:11.000]  last hour.
[34:11.000 --> 34:16.320]  And I'm like, wow, that's why we got to Google my name like every 10 minutes around here.
[34:16.320 --> 34:20.960]  I've really sat back and I've talked to my lawyers and I've said, we've got to send
[34:20.960 --> 34:27.880]  cease and desist letters to MPR and all these channels because they all know full well that
[34:27.880 --> 34:32.720]  I believe Sandy Hook happened for years, and that I've never sent anybody to their houses.
[34:32.720 --> 34:36.920]  And they had MPR shows the last two weeks in a row with family members and others on
[34:36.920 --> 34:41.440]  the show saying, please stop saying it didn't happen and please stop sending people to our
[34:41.440 --> 34:47.040]  house, and I'm like, well, it really sounds horrible if I'm doing that, right?
[34:47.040 --> 34:48.040]  But I'm not.
[34:48.040 --> 34:53.360]  And so it's the media always opening the old wounds and then saying, I'm doing it.
[34:53.360 --> 34:58.360]  And saying our whole career is based on Sandy Hook when it's something I barely covered.
[34:58.360 --> 35:02.920]  And then boom, in the last hour, dozens of articles have already broke and my heart goes
[35:02.920 --> 35:07.000]  out to this fellow and whatever happened, they're not sure it's suicide, they're saying
[35:07.000 --> 35:14.760]  it may be Alex Jones and Jeremy Richmond never even said Jeremy Richmond's name.
[35:14.760 --> 35:17.320]  It's in the lawsuit against me, he was suing me.
[35:17.320 --> 35:23.320]  But there I just said his name, Sandy Hook dad kills himself as defamation suit continues.
[35:23.320 --> 35:26.880]  This one says that other local news says they believe that's what it is.
[35:26.880 --> 35:29.760]  And then it's a picture of me.
[35:29.760 --> 35:33.840]  So this is what happens, folks, they make my whole identity this.
[35:33.840 --> 35:37.160]  This poor guy is dead.
[35:37.160 --> 35:41.600]  And there's an image of me, Alex Jones and Jeremy Richmond, Sandy Hook dad kills himself
[35:41.600 --> 35:50.040]  as defamation suit continues.
[35:50.040 --> 35:55.520]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[35:55.520 --> 35:57.640]  Father Sandy Hook shooting victim found dead.
[35:57.640 --> 36:03.120]  And here's the news WT WFSB saying they don't know.
[36:03.120 --> 36:05.200]  They say it's suicide.
[36:05.200 --> 36:08.640]  But certainly should be looked into.
[36:08.640 --> 36:12.200]  Now they'll say Jones says look into how he was found dead in front of the town hall.
[36:12.200 --> 36:18.040]  Yeah, you're supposed to look into murders, look into deaths, look into suicides.
[36:18.040 --> 36:19.960]  So there you go.
[36:19.960 --> 36:28.360]  Heart goes out to him and his family and I'll say it again, I believe Sandy Hook happened
[36:28.360 --> 36:31.640]  and I've never sent people their houses.
[36:31.640 --> 36:34.320]  I just I'm just bracing to see what the media says.
[36:34.320 --> 36:38.600]  I mean, they're already putting my face up on almost all these articles.
[36:38.600 --> 36:42.640]  What is it about my show?
[36:42.640 --> 36:45.000]  That's got the system so scared.
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.720]  I mean, I want to thank the New York Times.
[36:47.720 --> 36:53.520]  Seriously, they didn't put my face up on the front of it.
[36:53.520 --> 36:59.200]  Alex Jones and Jeremy Richmond, Sandy Hook dad kills himself as decimation suit continues.
[36:59.200 --> 37:04.120]  The New Haven register, another one, Alex Jones and Jeremy Richmond, Sandy Hook dad kills
[37:04.120 --> 37:10.280]  himself as decimation suit continues.
[37:10.280 --> 37:15.080]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[37:15.080 --> 37:18.680]  I have never said Jeremy Richmond's name.
[37:18.680 --> 37:24.000]  In fact, most of the people in these suits can I never even said their names and they're
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.400]  like 80 page lawsuits and I read it and most of stuff I never even said.
[37:28.400 --> 37:34.640]  And so that's why we know confidently, even if we don't get a fair jury down the road,
[37:34.640 --> 37:41.400]  the goes to that, that it'll be overturned on appeal because it'll make new public law.
[37:41.400 --> 37:46.120]  We've talked to top lawyers like Alan Dershowitz, you name it, and you know, they agree that
[37:46.120 --> 37:48.000]  this is just unheard of.
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.280]  You actually read the suits versus what I actually said.
[37:51.280 --> 37:52.440]  People ask, what is this all about?
[37:52.440 --> 37:53.920]  It's about ending the First Amendment.
[37:53.920 --> 37:56.720]  You know, it can be said that Sandy Hook is being used to go out with the Second Amendment.
[37:56.720 --> 38:00.000]  Well, it's been successful going out of the First Amendment so far.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.680]  So really, really sad.
[38:02.680 --> 38:09.400]  And then I'm just bracing for corporate media to further connect me to this poor man's
[38:09.400 --> 38:12.080]  death, the sad death.
[38:12.080 --> 38:16.440]  But this whole Sandy Hook thing has been weird from the start.
[38:16.440 --> 38:19.680]  And I believe it happened.
[38:19.680 --> 38:25.320]  And then I watch all these powerful forces that are swirling around all these big law
[38:25.320 --> 38:30.000]  firms, the Democratic Party, and all these think tanks, universities, and groups.
[38:30.000 --> 38:37.480]  And I've seen parents on the news go, we just want him to apologize before they ever sued
[38:37.480 --> 38:38.480]  me.
[38:38.480 --> 38:42.120]  And I said, okay, I'm not the guy that ever first said this, it was internet sensation.
[38:42.120 --> 38:43.120]  We covered it.
[38:43.120 --> 38:44.120]  But I said, okay, I apologize.
[38:44.120 --> 38:45.120]  I believe your kids died.
[38:45.120 --> 38:49.440]  And you know, I'm sorry if things, I've said questions, things hurt you.
[38:49.440 --> 38:53.640]  And that like triggered like blood in the water just.
[38:53.640 --> 39:00.240]  And so I guess that's why they always say don't apologize, especially the left, because
[39:00.240 --> 39:04.600]  it's always turned into something different than what you did.
[39:04.600 --> 39:06.800]  And I don't blame the families.
[39:06.800 --> 39:09.680]  They've been through a lot of trauma, you know, it's the law firms that convince the
[39:09.680 --> 39:12.880]  families to sue the dead hero teacher.
[39:12.880 --> 39:17.480]  And it's the law firms that convince them to sue the school district and the police
[39:17.480 --> 39:24.160]  and everybody else on and on and on the guy manufacturers and the Democratic Party.
[39:24.160 --> 39:29.320]  But Hillary came out and said that I'm the Sandy Hook guy.
[39:29.320 --> 39:34.280]  And that's when I really went, uh-uh, like three years ago, I said, stop it.
[39:34.280 --> 39:35.280]  That is not what I said.
[39:35.280 --> 39:38.040]  And that is not what I believe that's out of context.
[39:38.040 --> 39:44.920]  And because I was just sick of her trying to enrage her supporters to use me as a political
[39:44.920 --> 39:50.000]  weapon against Trump to build up the straw man and then hurt Trump in the country.
[39:50.000 --> 39:56.000]  And then once Hillary ran national ads, attacked me in speeches, when Trump lost, Democrats
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.520]  literally believe I got Trump elected.
[39:59.520 --> 40:00.520]  We were part of it.
[40:00.520 --> 40:02.120]  Our audience was a critical part of it.
[40:02.120 --> 40:05.840]  But they think I'm like Godzilla attacking Tokyo.
[40:05.840 --> 40:13.600]  They really believe that I'm the homeland character and that I've got like a thousand employees
[40:13.600 --> 40:20.280]  and I run the country and I got all the answers and I'm like this evil genius.
[40:20.280 --> 40:23.840]  And the truth is way far the opposite of that.
[40:23.840 --> 40:29.560]  We're mom and pop and we're dealing with just very standard things like making sure the
[40:29.560 --> 40:34.720]  garbage gets carried out and make sure that we fact check your stories and we're a very
[40:34.720 --> 40:39.920]  small crew of people and we absolutely make mistakes, but they're not done on purpose.
[40:39.920 --> 40:44.800]  I've never tried to go on air and lie about somebody or say something about an event because
[40:44.800 --> 40:46.160]  we gained from it.
[40:46.160 --> 40:48.360]  In fact, we looked at the numbers analytics.
[40:48.360 --> 40:54.680]  We lost listeners and stations entertaining that Sandy Hook could be staged.
[40:54.680 --> 40:59.800]  You don't gain stations going, hey, look at the vaccine insert says it can kill you.
[40:59.800 --> 41:01.840]  It does say that.
[41:01.840 --> 41:06.600]  But even famous Olympic athletes and people that say, hey, I took a vaccine and got real
[41:06.600 --> 41:07.600]  sick.
[41:07.600 --> 41:09.440]  People then death threat their kids.
[41:09.440 --> 41:12.920]  You question in this country, you get attacked.
[41:12.920 --> 41:14.920]  You get demonized.
[41:14.920 --> 41:17.600]  You go play footsie with the establishment.
[41:17.600 --> 41:18.600]  You go far.
[41:18.600 --> 41:22.200]  Now, we've gone far despite all that.
[41:22.200 --> 41:28.560]  But again, I said I'd cover it next time, so I could think about this, but there really
[41:28.560 --> 41:29.560]  nothing to think about.
[41:29.560 --> 41:35.920]  You know, my life's an open book and imagine I'm on a four minute break.
[41:35.920 --> 41:38.400]  I'm in there talking to him about posting the Joe Rogan interview that we're gonna air
[41:38.400 --> 41:39.400]  coming up.
[41:39.400 --> 41:44.120]  TimFallWars.com from last week, he would have been live in studio, but his plane was late.
[41:44.120 --> 41:45.120]  It's powerful.
[41:45.120 --> 41:46.600]  And they go, hey, have you heard about this?
[41:46.600 --> 41:49.200]  This poor Sandy Hook father found dead.
[41:49.200 --> 41:52.800]  They're not sure if it's suicide or what.
[41:52.800 --> 42:02.760]  And I'm just stepping back, looking at this shot himself in front of the town hall.
[42:02.760 --> 42:06.920]  I mean, how do I get a fair trial with stuff like this?
[42:06.920 --> 42:12.760]  I've never said this guy's name.
[42:12.760 --> 42:16.200]  Never said his name until now.
[42:16.200 --> 42:20.680]  And we're obviously first, it's, we don't know, he's got gunshot wounds or whatever
[42:20.680 --> 42:21.680]  now.
[42:21.680 --> 42:22.680]  It's, well, a parent suicide.
[42:22.680 --> 42:24.680]  I mean, is there gonna be a police investigation?
[42:24.680 --> 42:28.400]  Are they gonna look at the surveillance cameras?
[42:28.400 --> 42:31.200]  I mean, what happened to this guy?
[42:31.200 --> 42:37.880]  This whole Sandy Hook thing is like really getting even crazier.
[42:37.880 --> 42:44.720]  And the way the media has been on this since day one is what made people suspicious.
[42:44.720 --> 42:49.800]  When the media blamed all Americans for what happened, people are sick of that.
[42:49.800 --> 42:52.920]  Bad people are to blame for what happens with guns or cars or knives or baseball bats.
[42:52.920 --> 42:56.200]  But we should pray for the family of this poor gentleman.
[42:56.200 --> 42:59.760]  We pray for Jeremy Richmond's family.
[42:59.760 --> 43:05.560]  Nationalists are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[43:05.560 --> 43:10.920]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest and who's ready to do the
[43:10.920 --> 43:11.920]  damage.
[43:11.920 --> 43:12.920]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[43:12.920 --> 43:13.920]  We stopped her.
[43:13.920 --> 43:16.000]  We got a national stand.
[43:16.000 --> 43:17.920]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[43:17.920 --> 43:18.920]  We are winning.
[43:18.920 --> 43:24.440]  But those of us who are at the very front line at the tip of the spear are under unprecedented
[43:24.440 --> 43:25.440]  attack.
[43:25.440 --> 43:29.880]  They come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[43:29.880 --> 43:32.080]  This is about who wants it most.
[43:32.080 --> 43:36.280]  And you know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors, they've taken everything.
[43:36.280 --> 43:37.280]  I am in your hands.
[43:37.280 --> 43:38.280]  You are in my hands.
[43:38.280 --> 43:41.800]  I need financial support and I got products you and your family need.

[43:46.920 --> 43:50.440]  love, what I love, we bring it to you at m4shore.com.
[43:50.440 --> 43:55.120]  So please go to m4shore.com today, look at all the great products because we're in your
[43:55.120 --> 43:56.120]  hands.

[43:57.120 --> 43:58.640]  And your support is beyond critical.
[43:58.640 --> 43:59.640]  Thank you.
[43:59.640 --> 44:03.560]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, know that they can food during the fall, so they
[44:03.560 --> 44:04.560]  have it during the winter.
[44:04.560 --> 44:08.480]  And that's what I'm talking about at m4shore.com.
[44:08.480 --> 44:14.560]  With m4select, it's the full spectrum of my patriot supply on the top, most respected
[44:14.560 --> 44:15.560]  companies out there.
[44:15.560 --> 44:21.160]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their
[44:21.160 --> 44:23.240]  other distributors aren't able to do.
[44:23.240 --> 44:27.520]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total
[44:27.520 --> 44:28.520]  win-win.
[44:28.520 --> 44:34.360]  We have those incredible sell prices back at m4shore.com, on m4select, storeable foods,
[44:34.360 --> 44:38.600]  they've got special diet foods, they've got three month supplies, your supplies, weak
[44:38.600 --> 44:41.760]  emergency supplies, they've got so many great products there.
[44:41.760 --> 44:45.640]  If you've got a three year supply, if stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[44:45.640 --> 44:48.200]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[44:48.200 --> 44:53.200]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[44:53.200 --> 45:00.200]  m4shore.com and m4select, high quality, storeable foods, powered by my patriot supply.
[45:00.200 --> 45:02.240]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[45:02.240 --> 45:03.240]  Go ahead.
[45:03.240 --> 45:05.200]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[45:05.200 --> 45:08.920]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[45:08.920 --> 45:09.920]  It just gets old, man.
[45:09.920 --> 45:12.880]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[45:12.880 --> 45:15.120]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[45:15.120 --> 45:19.320]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[45:19.320 --> 45:22.440]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[45:22.440 --> 45:24.840]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[45:24.840 --> 45:27.560]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[45:27.560 --> 45:28.560]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[45:28.560 --> 45:29.560]  You know what, Alex?
[45:29.560 --> 45:31.040]  Hey, I put him on pause again.
[45:31.040 --> 45:36.120]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're
[45:36.120 --> 45:38.000]  under attack, we need your help.
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.400]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[45:42.400 --> 45:45.320]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[45:45.320 --> 45:46.320]  You understand?
[45:46.320 --> 45:47.600]  I need your help, Frank.
[45:47.600 --> 45:49.880]  I need your help, Frank.
[45:49.880 --> 45:55.040]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the Info War.
[45:55.040 --> 45:57.880]  Do you understand I need your help, Frank?
[45:57.880 --> 46:00.320]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[46:00.320 --> 46:05.200]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and
[46:05.200 --> 46:08.160]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[46:08.160 --> 46:10.760]  Info Wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[46:10.760 --> 46:14.320]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[46:14.320 --> 46:15.920]  I didn't invent all this.
[46:15.920 --> 46:20.800]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm
[46:20.800 --> 46:22.280]  simply trying to bring it back.
[46:22.280 --> 46:26.600]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[46:26.600 --> 46:30.560]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately, because we have the
[46:30.560 --> 46:34.120]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[46:34.120 --> 46:39.000]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Info Wars by buying the great products
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.400]  at infowarstore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for
[46:43.400 --> 46:48.000]  this operation, and for praying for this nation, and the world, for peace and discernment.
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.920]  For myself and the whole Info Wars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've
[46:51.920 --> 46:55.880]  done, because without you, Info Wars is nothing.
[46:55.880 --> 47:03.560]  You are the Info War, and I salute you.
[47:03.560 --> 47:09.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:09.880 --> 47:17.680]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones, who claims that
[47:17.680 --> 47:22.360]  9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[47:22.360 --> 47:29.560]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind, or how dark their heart must be.
[47:29.560 --> 47:37.760]  To say things like that, the Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against
[47:37.760 --> 47:44.800]  my campaign to influence voters in the election, and then they began to weaponize them.
[47:44.800 --> 47:54.000]  And they began to have some of their allies within the Internet world, like Info Wars,
[47:54.000 --> 48:00.200]  take out pieces, and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can
[48:00.200 --> 48:01.200]  imagine.
[48:01.200 --> 48:03.440]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[48:03.440 --> 48:09.240]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let
[48:09.240 --> 48:12.600]  you down.
[48:12.600 --> 48:19.320]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[48:19.320 --> 48:22.320]  the Info War.
[48:22.320 --> 48:30.080]  Well, I got to tell you something, it's being reported that the father of Sandy Hook
[48:30.080 --> 48:37.040]  victim, who I never said his name, who's pursuing me, has been found dead in front of the Town
[48:37.040 --> 48:44.240]  Hall Courthouse, and I'm looking at article after article, and you read them and it's
[48:44.240 --> 48:49.920]  about me, and it's my face.
[48:49.920 --> 48:56.520]  And so it'll now be Alex Jones killed this man, my questioning years ago, and so we've
[48:56.520 --> 48:59.920]  got to be taken off the air.
[48:59.920 --> 49:05.640]  After all this is going, I mean, this is as obvious as the day is long, how the media
[49:05.640 --> 49:08.040]  is going to use this tragic event.
[49:08.040 --> 49:14.440]  I'll tell you, it's just mind blowing, absolutely mind blowing.
[49:14.440 --> 49:24.120]  It's like being in a weird dystopic nightmare film, like Lost Highway or something.
[49:24.120 --> 49:30.120]  David Lynch is going to walk out any moment, I guess Lynch has been on the show before.
[49:30.120 --> 49:32.440]  This just never ends.
[49:32.440 --> 49:37.240]  And the weirdest thing is, I'm all over the news, I'm everywhere, doing my quote apology
[49:37.240 --> 49:41.640]  term for years, since Hillary said I said nobody died at Sandy Hook, saying I believe
[49:41.640 --> 49:44.640]  people died and I never said people to your houses, because one of the guys that actually
[49:44.640 --> 49:50.760]  goes up there is crazy, he's come down here and gotten in our face saying we're covering
[49:50.760 --> 49:53.760]  up saying Sandy Hook happened.
[49:53.760 --> 50:01.880]  I've already dealt with some of these crazies, and then though you can't get the families
[50:01.880 --> 50:09.200]  and their lawyers to stop saying that I'm currently doing it, and then that way it's
[50:09.200 --> 50:16.800]  a clear and present issue, like Roku take him off, he's doing it now, or NPR, he won't
[50:16.800 --> 50:21.600]  stop it, we just ask him to stop but he won't, it's why we have to do it, it's why we have
[50:21.600 --> 50:24.520]  to get rid of the First Amendment.
[50:24.520 --> 50:31.280]  So I believe people died there, but undoubtedly the Democratic Party, the media, these law
[50:31.280 --> 50:35.120]  firms are using this strategy in the First Amendment, some of the Democrats openly want
[50:35.120 --> 50:36.120]  right now.
[50:36.120 --> 50:46.400]  I mean, a bunch of the articles say his name, Alex Jones and Jeremy Richmond, Sandy Hook
[50:46.400 --> 50:55.240]  dad kills himself as decimation suit continues, and then it just goes on, article after article
[50:55.240 --> 51:02.760]  with my face on the front and my name with his death.
[51:02.760 --> 51:07.600]  We have no idea whether he was even murdered at this point, why would some anti-gun guy
[51:07.600 --> 51:08.600]  do this?
[51:08.600 --> 51:14.120]  This is really sad, my prayers go out to him and his family, and we wish for the truth
[51:14.120 --> 51:19.840]  of whatever really happened here to come out, we don't know yet, and we'll see the corporate
[51:19.840 --> 51:24.840]  media say outrageous lies, but it's what they do, and look, the good news of no collusion,
[51:24.840 --> 51:34.920]  the good news that I'm not a Russian agent comes out, and now this happens right on time.
[51:34.920 --> 51:41.080]  Just amazing, and he's one of many people, soon I've never said his name, I have now,
[51:41.080 --> 51:45.280]  and my prayers again for him and for his family.
[51:45.280 --> 51:51.080]  Let's go ahead and play one of the local newscasts that just came out about this, here it is.
[51:51.080 --> 51:54.200]  Breaking news at noon, we are now learning that a father of one of the Sandy Hook victims
[51:54.200 --> 51:56.440]  has taken his own life this morning.
[51:56.440 --> 52:02.000]  Newtown police were called to a building in town to respond to reports of a suicide.
[52:02.000 --> 52:06.520]  We now know that Jeremy Richmond, the father of Avial Richmond, was found dead.
[52:06.520 --> 52:09.640]  He had started a foundation in his daughter's name.
[52:09.640 --> 52:14.760]  Authorities Nicole Nalupa has been following this heart-wrenching story closely, Nicole,
[52:14.760 --> 52:17.120]  where does the investigation stand right now?
[52:17.120 --> 52:21.080]  Kerry, you said it, it is a heart-wrenching story, and heartbreaking for a community that
[52:21.080 --> 52:22.600]  has been hit with so much.
[52:22.600 --> 52:27.440]  Newtown police say Richmond's death appears to be a suicide, and that his death does not
[52:27.440 --> 52:30.520]  appear to be suspicious, and that is all that they're saying right now.
[52:30.520 --> 52:33.600]  I'm hearing an autopsy is expected to be done later today.
[52:33.600 --> 52:36.120]  So here's what we were able to find out for you on this story.
[52:36.120 --> 52:41.920]  Newtown police, ambulance, and fire were called to Edmontown Hall at 7 a.m. to investigate
[52:41.920 --> 52:43.840]  the report of a suicide.
[52:43.840 --> 52:48.520]  And just to be clear, Edmontown Hall is a theater and event space in town that houses
[52:48.520 --> 52:49.800]  many community events.
[52:49.800 --> 52:53.320]  That's where they found the body of 49-year-old Jeremy Richmond.
[52:53.320 --> 52:58.080]  He was the father of Avial Richmond, one of the first grade students killed in the 2012
[52:58.080 --> 53:00.120]  tragedy at Sandy Hook School.
[53:00.120 --> 53:04.520]  And he created the Avial Foundation in his daughter's memory, which was a nonprofit
[53:04.520 --> 53:10.360]  organization that focused on preventing violence through brain research and community engagement.
[53:10.360 --> 53:13.280]  Police say Richmond had an office at Edmontown Hall.
[53:13.280 --> 53:18.840]  Now, this news comes after two survivors of the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas
[53:18.840 --> 53:22.920]  High School in Parkland, Florida, committed suicide in the past week.
[53:22.920 --> 53:27.960]  The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is open 24 hours a day, so if you or someone
[53:27.960 --> 53:35.120]  you know needs help, please call this number, 1-800-273-8255, live in the studio, Nikola
[53:35.120 --> 53:37.440]  Leppa, Channel 3, Eyewitness News.
[53:37.440 --> 53:38.440]  Okay.
[53:38.440 --> 53:43.120]  And so they're saying, looks like a suicide of the media says they don't know, but let's
[53:43.120 --> 53:44.120]  just say it is.
[53:44.120 --> 53:45.120]  Let's just believe mainstream media.
[53:45.120 --> 53:46.680]  We're not supposed to ever question them.
[53:46.680 --> 53:47.680]  Fine.
[53:47.680 --> 53:49.760]  We have 22 service members spending suicide a day.
[53:49.760 --> 53:50.760]  It's an epidemic.
[53:50.760 --> 53:51.760]  We've got articles here.
[53:51.760 --> 53:52.760]  It's not just you.
[53:52.760 --> 53:57.840]  New data shows more than half of young people in America don't have a romantic partner.
[53:57.840 --> 54:00.200]  They have their iPhone.
[54:00.200 --> 54:02.840]  So people are very depressed.
[54:02.840 --> 54:04.160]  The iPhones are making us depressed.
[54:04.160 --> 54:06.080]  The screen time is.
[54:06.080 --> 54:09.280]  And it's very sad.
[54:09.280 --> 54:10.280]  I know this.
[54:10.280 --> 54:15.440]  It's the corporate media that says it is the worst thing on earth to question any mass
[54:15.440 --> 54:17.960]  event.
[54:17.960 --> 54:23.440]  And then they say that I'm questioning Sandy Hook like a parrot when I'm not.
[54:23.440 --> 54:28.320]  And then using my name to bring out the hurtful stories over and over and over again to hype
[54:28.320 --> 54:35.960]  up school shootings, which causes copycats to do it more.
[54:35.960 --> 54:38.440]  And so we don't know why he took his life or if he took his life.
[54:38.440 --> 54:41.880]  I mean, the police say that's what it's leaning towards regardless.
[54:41.880 --> 54:51.760]  This is very, very tragic and also very, very bizarre, obviously, and very, very sad.
[54:51.760 --> 54:56.200]  But I've told the lawyers this 50 times and I'm just going to do it.
[54:56.200 --> 54:58.200]  I'm sending letters.
[54:58.200 --> 54:59.200]  I'm going to hire a service.
[54:59.200 --> 55:03.000]  I'm going to send cease and desist letters to probably a thousand media outlets and I'm
[55:03.000 --> 55:04.400]  going to send it to all the lawyers.
[55:04.400 --> 55:06.480]  I've told their lawyers face to face too.
[55:06.480 --> 55:07.480]  You know, full well.
[55:07.480 --> 55:11.320]  It's been years and years since I said that it's legitimate for people to question and
[55:11.320 --> 55:15.560]  maybe this was staged because of past events that have been staged.
[55:15.560 --> 55:19.640]  And they do stuff like clip out where I even repeat what I said before out of context and
[55:19.640 --> 55:21.560]  say, look, he's doing it again.
[55:21.560 --> 55:26.320]  It's crazy and it's got to stop because if you're claiming I'm the devil for saying the
[55:26.320 --> 55:31.360]  stuff didn't happen and then opening wounds out of context years ago and then you keep
[55:31.360 --> 55:39.560]  doing it, it's bad and it's outrageous and stop doing it in my name.
[55:39.560 --> 55:43.000]  Regardless folks, they're trying to shut us down and you know that and who knows how long
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.080]  info wars can hold on with stuff like this going on.
[55:45.080 --> 55:49.720]  I mean, this is just next level, but regardless, please pray for us and buy the products.

[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:26.680]  Texas transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones all right folks we've got the big exclusive
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:32.120]  Joe Rogan interview coming up I've also got some commentary about Joe I got really mad
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.960]  at him a few months ago but then I had some private talks with him and understand where
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:45.960]  he's coming from now I have been completely pull axed to hear that one of the Sandy Hook
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:54.040]  parents who I'd never said his name who's shooing me and I guess gun manufacturers too
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:01:00.200]  and a bunch of other people committed suicide they think they're not sure at the community
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:05.080]  that's a community hall that sounded to me like the city hall but it's it's it's it's
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:12.800]  like a community center and then you turn the internet on it doesn't matter what newspaper
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:20.520]  is Alex Jones and Jeremy Richmond Sandy Hook dad kills himself as defamation suit continues
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:27.800]  so they haven't even read a note yet they don't it's just put my face up there immediately
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:34.760]  the corporate media is just incredible just incredible well let me just say this right
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:42.760]  now I will never commit suicide and no matter what the corporate media does or how they
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:50.400]  spend tragic events against me I'm never backing down I'm never giving up and since all this
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:59.640]  demonization and attack has gone on on the streets of this country 99% the interaction
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:08.880]  I get is positive the 1% is extremely negative and hateful and also lies they'll start a
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.880]  fight with you and then say you did it to them they're all a bunch of just small it's
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:19.120]  they act the same it's it's a very deceptive culture that the left's involved in that's
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:31.360]  what they do they deceive and that's their talent but I just wonder how much more twilight
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:36.560]  zone this is going to get because it's not like I'm saying I'm walking in the hall and
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:43.360]  they go did you hear about the sandy hook dad committing suicide and I said no and I knew
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:48.600]  as they as I walked in to look at the computer screen to be my face now I thought I'd be
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:56.440]  like a paragraph down or something no no no I'm at the top of almost all the articles
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:04.080]  good lord you know with some veteran kills themselves they show Obama because he sent
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:10.920]  him to Afghanistan or they showed Bush some Iraq no you can actually show some cause if
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:19.320]  you know those illegal wars but with me they just show me because that's all the media
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:27.640]  has got and that's what they're going to push forever I'm not going to talk about this anymore
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:32.200]  until there's new development Senate but I'm sorry for his family and hopes and prayers
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:39.880]  go out to them Jeremy Richmond but a big public speaker had a foundation raising money to
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:45.080]  deal with mentally ill people to make sense with whole Adam lands a situation so sounds
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:49.960]  like a good guy we said that's going on I was actually looking forward you know if things
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.360]  progressed it was looking forward to things progressing but if they did to actually look
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:59.040]  at these people in the eyes and you know presenting the dozens of times I put out videos saying
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:03.000]  I believe it's children died and I'm sorry of the fact that we had to question official
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  events you know you hurt your feelings but you know I'm not saying that currently and
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.960]  I never really said it the way you're saying I did but I understand that was your lawyers
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:20.720]  told you that you would never knowingly know that I hadn't said those things or wasn't

[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:03.880]  can't be seen as symbols of victory for others we've got to be lied about and demonized and
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:13.160]  destroyed in the court of public opinion and then sued into oblivion so that nobody else
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:20.120]  ever dare stick their head up but a funny thing happened all that intimidation all that censorship
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:27.960]  all those lies have backfired and now the globalists are going to escalate their attacks because
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:34.400]  they know that nothing they're doing is working so we've entered the season of the jesse small
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:44.520]  it event and as I told you a month ago there are federal investigations of obama being
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:53.320]  involved with the head prosecutor that told police to back off small it and connections
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:59.560]  to the obama running small it and that was in the new york post and the chicago tribune
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:05.080]  on friday night i i missed it till sunday i saw it but maybe you guys can type that in
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:11.880]  just into a search engine click news the headline was uh chicago police call for federal probe
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:18.680]  into small it there it is cops call for federal probe related to obama aid involvement in
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:30.760]  jesse small it case now type in your search engine feds probing accomplices who they believe
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:36.760]  helped small it you'll get a couple articles and videos with me telling you our sources
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:43.000]  told us that that is indeed happening and who did i say they were looking at but i said
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  they were looking at the people directing the show who stood to make tens of millions of
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.520]  dollars if the show didn't get unpopular we're starting to get unpopular starting to lose
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:09:03.640]  momentum a lot of momentum lost half its ratings the last two years and obama who did i say
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:11.960]  specifically because we have the sources there you go and again you can go back to the article
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:18.680]  from weeks ago in fact it's in my yesterday's stack i never got to it pull that one for me
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:23.960]  because i want to show the one from weeks ago there's two of them from info wars dot com
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:36.360]  and the headline ish feds probing accomplices more accomplices of jesse small it or others
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:43.960]  that may have helped small it and then i list obamas and i say high level people controlling
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:48.360]  the show who have the motive to make tens of millions so when you hear it's not just cause a
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:53.480]  race war that's part of that it really is about money small it was going to make a lot more money
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:59.080]  not just a million whatever it was a year million one if the show got higher ratings he'd get more
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:05.960]  money so it's true he was doing it for money who's the cherry on top that created all this racial
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:13.480]  division but i want to get more into muller probe because this was all the legal thing kicked off
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:20.840]  by hillary and obama again we told you that first and now and now it's out in the open so what are
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:29.160]  they going to do here is a report muller report reveals treasonous dams there was no collusion
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:39.080]  with russia there was no obstruction and then whatsoever and it was a complete and total
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:48.280]  exoneration it's a shame that our country had to go through this to be honest it's a shame that
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:56.760]  your president has had to go through this for before i even got elected it began and it began
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:03.960]  illegally and hopefully somebody's going to look at the other side once again in this document
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:09.240]  that the attorney general has just submitted to congress concluding after all of this investigation
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:14.040]  nearly two-year investigation by the special counsel robert muller and his team no collusion
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:23.400]  bottom line no collusion 40 fbi agents 2800 subpoenas 500 witnesses 500 search warrants 230
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:30.440]  communications records 50 wiretaps 13 foreign government intelligence requests and after
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:39.880]  675 days there is no collusion and insufficient evidence of obstruction however in broad daylight
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:46.840]  the mainstream media and the democratic party colluded in an effort to impeach the duly elected
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:52.760]  president of the united states of america with fabricated evidence we're at turning point here
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:58.760]  the beginning of the end for the trump presidency the beginning of the end and breaking news we have
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:04.520]  another bombshell mic pants might have to assume the office of the presidency the call for impeachment
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:09.320]  rumblings of the word impeachment breaking news another bombshell out of the white house i believe
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:13.800]  this is the beginning of the end it's really the beginning of the end the beginning of the end
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:19.480]  this is a tipping point trump's going down this president could be impeached i do not think the
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:26.040]  president will serve out his term this is treason and it was committed in living color across the
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:31.720]  television screens of america yet the democrats and their deep state operatives within the
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:38.040]  mainstream media are going all in with their manufactured delusion simply because the special
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.760]  council could not connect the dots does not mean that the dots don't matter and the dots
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:48.520]  aren't troubling saying no collusion no collusion no collusion over and over again for a long time
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:54.280]  now and he's going to try and conclude that there this report is proving that there's no
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:13:00.360]  collusion and you have a lot of his sycophants who will you know take the nod from him and they'll
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:07.560]  say the same thing but we cannot allow them to get away with this he does this all the time this
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:12.440]  is not the end of anything i think he's going to continue to say look i told you the truth i said
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:17.960]  it was a hoax i said there was no collusion and the media and the democrats essentially lied to
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.520]  you that's going to be a core message i think for them moving forward and it's going to be part of
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:27.960]  their campaign because you've had these democrats adam schiff and blooming fall and all the rest
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:31.880]  of the ones that have been involved uh you know running from green room to green room saying we
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:37.640]  have direct evidence of collusion that was totally blown up by moeller today and the president's
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:43.080]  going to argue if they were willing to lie to you about this what else would they lie to you about
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:49.480]  just to win an election said we're not exonerating the president after 22 months for the attorney
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:58.840]  general reviewing that record in 22 hours uh is a bit much i would in fact wonder if the attorney
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:03.560]  general pressured the special counsel into not making that finally said he was made without
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:08.840]  regard to and is not based on the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:14.680]  and criminal prosecution of the sitting president uh that's very significant jeffrey that that is
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:20.920]  but it but it again it's important to uh to to point out that that determination was not made
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:28.040]  by moller it was made by the president's subordinates the the attorney general bar and and rod
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:33.320]  rozenstein never a person that thought bill bar was was somebody to be listened to and respected
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:38.760]  bill bar was appointed by donald trump after he decided that jeff sessions wasn't his roy cone
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:43.960]  he wasn't his his ace attorney looking out for him not for the country not for justice
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:48.520]  and bill bar was put in there for a reason i don't doubt he went to a group like the federalist
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:54.680]  society who picked him his judges and said find me a guy that'll be my roy cone the deep state took
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:15:02.040]  a big swing and missed the american people should respond with a haymaker of investigations of the
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:09.960]  democratic party the media the fbi and the clinton foundation now that upwards of 40 million dollars
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:18.520]  of a taxpayer distraction has imploded i was told by really smart high-level sources that as soon
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:22.680]  as the moller report came out trump will drop the hammer on censorship which he's now doing is the
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:30.120]  universities and their anti-free speech activity and more is set to come but make no mistake it was
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:36.920]  obama it was hillary and others that set up this fake criminal investigation that's the crime
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:42.280]  and now the democrats because they failed in their crime it could be brought to justice any time
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:48.440]  for being involved in it are trying to double down they are crazy oh more hammers dropping

[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:34.520]  a distraction it was a diversion there's the head of the largest most powerful country in the world

[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:39.720]  they had by simply not even allowing people in many cases to know who was on the ballot
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:45.720]  many congressional districts would just show democrats names or it would say that republicans
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:52.280]  affiliation was the nazi party they would not let you search certain names of certain candidates

[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:16.200]  one of the top tv host in england's named alex jones she's a lovely welsh girl i was on her show
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:21.160]  once we made the joke that if we married she would change her name we both be named mr and mrs
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:26.760]  alex xander jones she's alexander i'm alex let me go by alex we don't have to change any names there

[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:41.560]  are all just stacked up and then on my name they all get revenue and money so there's another element
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:49.000]  of fraud see that slavery they use edited tapes of me and everything to make money and then everybody
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.120]  else is feverishly trying to upload alex jones videos but no one can see them except you can
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:58.520]  promote them on reddit and twitter everywhere else and then use it as a hosting platform
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:04.280]  they haven't figured out a way to try to block that out yet but they're sending everyone to the phantom
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:13.560]  zone oh beto auror he's up to the hour he's up to them day up to the week up to the month of the

[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:52.040]  no one even knows why it happened and it's just it's alex jones' fault and i can't respond on

[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:41.240]  doesn't have half the protein or fat it is needed so your child has a tiny brain how they make the
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:47.640]  formula so low-level in africa kids die by the tens of thousands something in asia and if that
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:51.720]  doesn't work they want a bunch of tainted vaccines designed to cause brain damage the inserts say so

[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:33.000]  and now if you pull back they want to euthanize old people
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:39.720]  but they sure care about your kids and want them to take those vaccines even though almost all the
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:45.160]  new cases of measles it turns out are in areas where illegal aliens are being brought in with no
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:49.800]  vetting the democrats say yeah don't stop them just let them in well if you've ever been to

[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:21.720]  the christ church shooter wrote that his motive was to create a conflict over gun rights that
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:27.960]  will ultimately result in a civil war and not only is the new zealand government eager to comply
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:35.560]  with the shooter's desire i can tell you one thing right now our gun laws will change but they made
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:42.680]  it illegal to possess the video that was streamed on facebook and the mainstream media is telling you
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:51.000]  to not read the manifesto tyranny has taken root down under and asking questions is becoming a crime

[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:32.840]  john pedesta said new zealand's a big juicy target in the video that terrant live streamed on facebook
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:41.160]  there are anomalies a barefoot victim suddenly has on blue socks a loaded magazine seems to
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:47.800]  be waiting for the shooter on the floor inside the mosque shell casings seem to disappear into
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:56.760]  thin air after firing hundreds of rounds in the main room the walls remain untouched and the bodies
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:03.880]  unblooded during the shooting there were at least two active drill scheduled in christ church

[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:19.880]  in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:24.360]  but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:30.520]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and rock ux2 that's been incredible now due to the
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:35.880]  establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:41.240]  of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:47.880]  it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it and makes it

[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:52.600]  went ahead and told them post the full video to info wars dot com and the news wars dot com
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:58.520]  we can pull that up i'll give people the title uh but it's uh c joe rogan's newest podcast with alex
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:06.040]  jones in austin texas and it's very important that people see that interview but i'm going to air
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:13.560]  some large excerpts of it in the next hour then will johnson's coming in but the situation with google
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:21.880]  censoring and how now computer scientists and top professors have looked at it and said no we can
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:30.680]  prove that they skewed votes to make democrats win key congressional districts that's election meddling
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:34.600]  and that's google using themselves the supposed search engine to do it but listen it used to
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:40.280]  be an algorithm that whatever you like the best whatever you search went to the top so we were
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:45.560]  at the top they broke the sucker and you can't just halfway break it google's broke
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:52.360]  and i showed this earlier of your tv viewer but i want to do it when i'm standing up really
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:58.280]  professionally and and and and showing folks but you can type in my name or other conservatives
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:04.040]  names or other nationalist names into youtube the biggest video site in the world over half
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:07.880]  the videos in the world are watched on it it's like 70 look at that number what percentage
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:15.320]  of online videos are watched on youtube it looks 70 last time i saw them and they will not let you
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:24.840]  search exact headlines of me and then i went let's check michael sabbage let's check and it was
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:33.800]  everybody but beto orork or camilla harris why it's up to the minute that is so criminal
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:39.880]  and then sundar gets up there in front of congress and says we're not censoring anything
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:48.360]  when their own internal memos show what they're doing it's dangerous it's out of control
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:52.120]  it's crazy
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:07.480]  so again let's go to youtube.com all of you can do this go to youtube.com and type in
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:19.640]  at the search box alex jones and when you've typed alex jones on you see the first filter
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:26.280]  without putting any filter on it is the list of megan kelly john oliver the guardian vice
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:33.400]  cnbc now it's all hit pieces not because they were popular because they've been forced fed
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:39.720]  that happened about what happened last august right when i got the platform they also rigged it
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:44.360]  where all the top search results were hate pieces and at first they didn't have any views but then
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:49.480]  they some of those have like 20 million views because everybody searching alex jones only gets those
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:58.600]  but people kept going deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and so you could watch sometimes
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:03.640]  100 videos a minute being uploaded i would go check it like i couldn't even and some would
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:08.040]  have 10 000 views and some 100 views but a day later someone had like a million views they
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:13.560]  would get deleted but to get a million views in one day what i actually said people there trying
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:22.120]  to find it so youtube starting on march 15th with the christ church situation
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:31.320]  they suddenly made it where no conservatives are no nationalist anywhere it's not just me
[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:38.680]  can be searched but beto auror and the democrats all still work so by name they don't let you
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:43.720]  search period they just give you what you want that's called fraud so click filter please for
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:54.840]  tv viewers okay full screen thank you now let's click last hour boom exact same results let's click

[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:31.160]  are all from a year ago they just picked anti stuff a year ago and they just throw it up there
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:37.000]  and that's what you get show you know the rest of google google is the same it owns youtube
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:44.200]  same crap you have to go to the url in full wars dot com or news wars dot com or prison planet dot
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:49.320]  com and yeah we have our own commenting system doesn't work as good as discussed it they took
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:54.120]  that away from us they took most of our bank accounts away they took our paypal away they took
[01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:58.120]  our sponsors away they took our ability to advertise away they're taking it all away
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:04.200]  as a beta test for you and everybody else and guess what now it's here
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:06.280]  here it's here
[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:19.560]  Sean Hannity Michael Savage Tucker Carlson Laura Ingram Lou Dobbs
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:25.320]  they must have gotten in trouble for this because last week trump was only set videos
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:31.960]  i checked it again yesterday and it was showing new videos but let's see hell let's test it live
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:36.280]  on air let's see if they're still blocking the president because they had the gall to do that
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:44.040]  let's go to uh google please hell they banned his head of social media last week from posting
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:51.560]  member facebook did let's go back to youtube and let's type in donald trump or president trump
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:54:03.400]  and let's see let's click it and that's one hour ago so the filter is not doing it now
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:09.160]  they are giving you the president they weren't doing it as of yesterday but oh here's the thing
[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:13.080]  google brags and this professor is talking about in articles up on drugreport dot com
[01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:18.840]  info wars dot com right mark dot com google search bias flip seats for democrats in midterms
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:25.720]  and stole the election they meddled and it says they studied how they did it they didn't always not
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:31.960]  let you see the other candidate they would shave it statistically for what needed to make you not
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:38.120]  see the opposition candidate or the leading candidate the republican candidate so only some
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:49.480]  other time in the algorithm do they not let you see trump but somebody like me it's a hundred
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:57.240]  percent let's go ahead and play um that professor the articles in full up on info wars dot com
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:03.560]  we're almost out of time but let me go ahead and get to uh get to that piece from rt here it is
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:10.360]  we had a field agents focusing on three congressional races in california which were
[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:18.200]  very hotly contested races in republican districts and we gave to these field agents
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:25.080]  about 500 election related search terms each one had different search terms for different
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:31.640]  districts where there are different issues of course and the point is we we we we simply looked
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:36.600]  at what half what kind of search results they received when they were conducting election
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:46.440]  related searches and we found very consistently uh that on google they ended up with search results
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:52.760]  favoring liberals and favoring liberal news sources and it was quite a dramatic effect
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:59.560]  and by the way that disclaimer that denial that you just played from google you have to listen
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:04.920]  very very very carefully to what they're saying they're saying they don't re-rank they're very
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:09.960]  careful you know in their their denials we don't re-rank i i've never claimed they re-rank anything
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:15.720]  i'm just recording on what they actually show people and what they show people is dramatically
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:24.280]  biased enough in our 2018 elections to have shifted shifted upwards of 78.2 million votes
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:34.680]  spread across different races in the u.s. in 2018 they call that but that's just one way they do it
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:39.960]  in california they listed all republicans as nazis political affiliation nazi
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:47.800]  and that is senior research psychologist dr robert eppstein of the american institute for
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:55.160]  behavioral research and technology which is basically DARPA he said it was a deciding factor and by
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:57:00.200]  the way every race they looked at the democrats and stolen them so republicans had to have like a
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:06.600]  30 point landslide to even win and trumps like well you just need to behave yourself and we'll
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:14.440]  we'll still win buh buh buh buh boulder dash buh buh buh buh buh baloney this is the real meddling
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:20.200]  get on it call the white house we're gonna post this segment this live feed later the total proof
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:25.480]  that google stole the election and is currently rigging search results against conservatives
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:32.280]  you just saw it if you're a tv viewer anybody can go do it for themselves it's amazing please don't

[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:39.880]  you know i'm not good at hyping things up i just delivered and we've got the fact that we broke
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:44.280]  the russian collusion as a smoke stream by hillary and obama to overturn the election
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:47.560]  and that that's really their achilles heel of total crime that's all confirmed now
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:53.080]  we broke the fact that google fixing search results on the mass scale and i confronted
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:57.960]  the head of google personally a few months ago now all that's coming out you have top computer
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:04.840]  scientists that do work for darpa that had up major institutes coming out proving that they
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:10.280]  still did with the search results where you couldn't even see conservative candidates to 78 million
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:19.800]  voters and stole the midterms decisively decisively they're the new phone book it'd be
[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:26.280]  like saying you can't put a conservative candidate a phone book but but beyond that and it's all the
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:31.320]  other big tech working in concert here's an example i'm going to lucy's fried chicken
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:37.240]  this weekend and people come over to where i'm sitting and three times tell me eat crap we're
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:42.200]  going to get you just horrible vicious threats i leave they're waiting outside the door cussing
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:46.760]  and screaming at me i have to walk around them and say we'll screw you back they edit the tape
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:51.720]  like i came over to them and did nothing and then reddit only allows the edited tape up
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:02:00.360]  we put out the full tape reddit as of this morning will not let you post imagine the worship of the
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:06.600]  fraud now that's the moderators over the austin subreddit it's not as bad as the donald but i
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:13.480]  mean this is like do you have to sue reddit to make them stop that like this is how the left
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:20.040]  operates if we didn't have info wars and god love them they got a lot of problems fox news you
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:26.520]  never know jesse small it made that up i first questioned it if all we had was reddit and google
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:35.400]  and we had video that jesse small it staged it they wouldn't care it doesn't matter i have the video
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:40.840]  i had the managers apologizing that they came over to my table to start a fight with me and
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:48.360]  then i didn't respond three times and then leaving them flipping me off cussing saying they hope i die
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:54.280]  eat sh you know what i'm like well i got to go out this way anyways i'm walking by him and i'm
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:03:01.400]  walking by the guy saying it to me and i'm like get up then man let's go you're saying i'm gonna get
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:12.920]  it you're about that he goes security he's at my table these people are sick but that's not what's
[02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:21.560]  sick saturday morning my security when my security guy calls me he goes well i guess you know it's
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:26.680]  the top of reddit what you did at lucy's or what happened at lucy's should have taken me with you
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:32.040]  and i go i know i was going to eat dinner with joe rogan and my wife didn't really like her dinners
[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:36.760]  and she wanted some oysters and so joe went to his comedy club and i went went to lucy's and
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:41.240]  i had a bad feeling and i'll take you next time just so they you know there's a witness and i'm
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:45.640]  sort of having my security guy's body cams just like all the time just have one all the time

[02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:28.040]  last friday he's going to air right now and it really gets powerful where he calls out the internet
[02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:34.200]  sensors and how dangerous it is and he gets into why he's mellowed out in a lot of ways and it's a
[02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:38.840]  powerful interview the last interview i did with him is the second largest podcast in history
[02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:45.320]  that's obviously a platform where i'm not censored joe show this of course is alex jones
[02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:49.960]  interviewing someone and so the gods of control will try to block it but they can't stop you
[02:06:49.960 --> 02:06:54.680]  from where we have it posted in our own format at info wars dot com we have it posted on some other
[02:06:54.680 --> 02:06:59.320]  places where you can spread it and it's free to air anybody can post this anybody can use this
[02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:03.880]  anybody can do what you want with it but i'm going to air a few segments of it because there's been so
[02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:09.000]  many big developments on the muller front and how the democrats are responding that i'm going to be
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:14.280]  coming back later in the hour to get into this but if you just joined us total proof by top computer
[02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:19.320]  scientists that google stole the election these are nonpartisan people most of maxi democrats
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:24.840]  but they believe in real elections and the google has much too much power and we also have
[02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:31.080]  proven we showed the video earlier anybody can do this that conservatives are banned from
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:37.960]  searchability on youtube just period and so that video will be uploaded the next 30 minutes
[02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:45.160]  to info wars dot com the proof that that all happened not just research shows they flipped
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:50.600]  major seats for democrats in the midterms but that they also are rigging search results where you
[02:07:50.600 --> 02:07:58.200]  can't even find conservatives that searching for them is banned entirely and that only negative
[02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:06.280]  comments and negative videos are hand-fed into it it's unbelievable coordination and fraud
[02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:12.920]  and then a lot of congressmen say no no this is going on so it's amazing but here is a large segments
[02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:20.040]  of the joe rogan interview stay with us well this is going to be quite the commercial free raw
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:28.760]  teleprompter free talking point free transmission joe rogan undoubtedly has the largest
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:35.000]  program in the world not just on tv not just on radio but on the internet the largest regular
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:43.000]  podcast in the world dwarfing in many weeks what the nfl has viewing it and i am the most banned
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:48.840]  person in the world who has routinely also had the largest radio or tv show on the planet
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:54.840]  so this is quite a meeting of the minds and i've known joe since 1999 or so known in good for about
[02:08:54.840 --> 02:09:07.480]  17 18 years and i've never seen him so satisfied in a good way so so happy so so content because he
[02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:12.200]  was always driven world champion ty quando even fighting up you know above his rank and winning
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:19.720]  that even the heavyweight big ufc guy movie star a bunch of big tv shows news radio and going through
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:27.160]  all the stuff you've done but now you seem finally satisfied because joe you're now officially the
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:33.080]  world heavyweight champion of all media something howard stern something howard stern said he did
[02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:37.400]  but he never really did so howard stern would tell us nothing it's howard stern good guy very
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:41.720]  the point is he just calls me to be banned off the internet even though it's a free speech but
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:49.320]  seriously you are the official global heavyweight champion of all media now and and there's a real
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:53.640]  satisfaction admit it joe you always had this kind of you still have to drive uh and we're a
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:57.960]  scary guy tough guy but now you still have all that but it seems like you're seems like you've
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:04.520]  kind of found found what you were looking for i think i've just gotten older and wiser and i've
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:11.320]  learned to smell the flowers and um without getting too sad i've also lost a bunch of friends
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:18.440]  you know i've had um three friends commit suicide this year and you just realize what's
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:23.800]  important and what's not important there's a lot of a lot of things we uh dwell on that are just
[02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:29.560]  nonsense and this life has a lot of beautiful things to it there's a lot of it that's great
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:34.920]  and i've chosen to spend more time thinking about the good things and thinking about the
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:41.160]  positive aspects of life and friends and friendship and things that i enjoy doing like stand up and
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:47.640]  podcast and the ufc and and not not being so uh tense about things i've just i've worked hard at
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:51.960]  it i'm not always good at it you know i have my good days and my bad days like everybody else but
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:56.600]  i just i'm you know i just think i've gotten wiser i always have tried
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:03.240]  so you're not satisfied because you're number one you're saying you're just satisfied because
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:08.440]  you've gotten older and you figured out stuff i don't think about the number one thing i know
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:13.960]  the podcast does really well but what i concentrate on is just trying to do the best show that i can
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:18.520]  and have fun and the only way that i can do the best show that i can is to have fun with it i
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:22.760]  mean to be prepared but also to have fun so that's what i think about i don't i don't think about like
[02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:28.680]  you know i don't think about dominating ratings or anything like that or continuing to do that
[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:33.880]  or i i support everybody else in media it's totally obsessed with it with obsessed with
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:39.240]  rating number one yeah that's that's just seems to me like you either are you aren't and if you
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:43.800]  aren't it doesn't matter there's so many people in this world there's hundreds of millions of people
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:48.840]  just in this country like you don't have to be number one you just have to be you just have to
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:53.640]  be something for somebody you just have to be entertaining i mean we're in the entertainment
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:12:00.520]  business you're more of a uh an information distributor or like what would you consider yourself
[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:04.520]  a journalist like how do you consider yourself i'm just somebody who's freaked out by what's
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:10.200]  going on like human animal hybrids and uh you know the the hadron super collider and all this crazy
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:13.880]  stuff that nobody even seems to care so i get freaked out about that so i'm just kind of a man
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:18.520]  you ever talked to someone from cern i've tried to get cern on the show i did have the head of
[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:23.320]  harp on once the civilian head and then a colonel popped in during the break and said he said too
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:27.720]  much click interviews over he's like well we do set the atmosphere on fire at night but not about me
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:33.800]  because i said i wanted to get you in here and i wanted to do a calm interview but i just did
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:39.000]  the big motor mouth intro and the rest of it uh so we talked about the fact that you agree though
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:44.440]  you're the most satisfied of your life yeah yeah i think um in some ways but like when it comes to
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:49.640]  stand up uh right now i'm in the middle of putting together a new hour i released my netflix special
[02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:56.840]  in october and so in that sense this is like the least satisfied time for me because there's a period
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:13:04.600]  every two years i release a release a stand-up special on netflix and then for the next 10
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:11.080]  to 11 months it's chaos and that's where i'm at right now so constantly reworking material
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:17.400]  rewriting it performing almost every night except usually monday and tuesday i'll take or uh sunday
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:22.440]  and monday i'll take like two days off a week but i'm doing three four sets a night always writing
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:27.960]  always reworking stuff so in that sense it's not not satisfied at all so by the way that's
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:34.840]  extremely americana say left or right vote if i tried to quantify joe rogan i would say americana
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:40.280]  from boston an extreme work ethic uh because i know people that know you a lot better than i do
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:47.080]  and they say man joe works like 15 16 hours a day and he's like really focused and that's something
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:51.160]  that we're really missing as a country because i hear you talk about these exercise experts you
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:55.560]  have on and you know all these amazing guests and then delta force guy you had almost really amazing
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:59.720]  when i talk about people being fat slobs i'm on on some high horse because i'm a fat slob myself
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:05.080]  but i still exercise more than most people i can't imagine where we're gonna go as all the
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:10.120]  statistics show people are getting softer they're getting stupider and it's not like i'm looking oh
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:14.680]  these people are idiots they're soft i'm soft too but compared to most soft people i'm you know i'm
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:19.080]  on the you know high end not the low end it's scary have an article of the daily mail a big
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:26.440]  archaeology study that came out 2014 how they've looked at farmers in africa in europe in england
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:33.000]  they were twice as strong as olympic athletes today and they think their iqs were higher
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:38.200]  i mean that's scary that 7300 years ago we wonder why chimpanzee can tear somebody's face off
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:41.960]  they're primitive they're it's still in the wild something's happening to us and quite frankly
[02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:46.920]  we're degenerating well if you look at lower hominids you know if you look at chimps and
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:54.040]  orangutans and they're so much stronger than us and we evolved from lower hominids but our world
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:15:01.080]  does not require physical strength our world it it's barely requires mental strength anymore i mean
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:06.840]  everything is kind of spelled out for you it's uh there's certain jobs of course that will require
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:12.200]  you to use your brain but uh a lot of them just require you to follow directions you know and i
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:17.400]  think uh as we become less and less physical and as discipline like physical discipline in

[02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:22.360]  you gotta know what kind of human you are i don't think everybody should have to work out the way
[02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:26.760]  i do but i think everybody like me has to work out the way i do because if you don't you don't
[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:32.200]  think straight it's just i was about to say because i've never gotten super shaped like you but i just
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:36.200]  run six miles every other day you were yeah you were jacked when you were younger man i saw pictures
[02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:39.640]  of you when you were uh working out and then i kind of stopped doing it and then once you get fat
[02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:44.680]  and really got a shape it's hard to get back but when i like like this morning i hiked around for
[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:48.520]  a couple miles one of a few big hills they're like you know three quarters of a mile and the the blood
[02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:53.640]  pumping through my brain i was having the best thoughts ever yeah once like the blood is energizing
[02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:58.120]  the brain it's electrochemical and i was just like god i wish my back wasn't hurting i keep
[02:20:58.120 --> 02:21:02.920]  hiking for five hours yeah yeah a lot of writers like to do that they like to write in the morning
[02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:07.640]  and then they go for a walk afterwards go for a hike and get the blood pumping and then while
[02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:12.360]  they're hiking then they think about the writing they think about what they wrote exactly like i'll
[02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:17.160]  be on the elliptical and again not that i'm in shape but like about an hour about 30 minutes in
[02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:20.360]  i don't even watch tv or listen to music anymore obviously and it's all of a sudden it's like yeah
[02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:25.320]  wow whoa and but you it's like i can't capture that magic once i'm off there well there's a
[02:21:25.320 --> 02:21:29.720]  real benefit to doing it without music too i like to listen to music and i like to listen to
[02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:35.720]  books on tape and podcasts and stuff sometimes when it's on tape but i also like to not i like
[02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:40.600]  to do it with nothing because i think that especially after like 15 20 minutes of constantly
[02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:45.560]  pushing you it's a meditative thing you start getting into the breathing you're concentrating
[02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:50.120]  on your breathing and you don't think about anything and then all the other problems that
[02:21:50.120 --> 02:21:55.080]  you may or may might have might not have whatever ever whatever issues you might have in your life
[02:21:55.080 --> 02:22:01.320]  they become less and less significant they become more you have a balanced perspective based on
[02:22:01.320 --> 02:22:05.960]  physical exertion because when you're really exhausted though your your body's really thinking
[02:22:05.960 --> 02:22:10.360]  it's trying to stay alive right you're running up a hill and you're doing sprints and you realize
[02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:17.080]  you got a hundred yards to go and you're you have no room in your head for bull there's
[02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:24.440]  there's no room and that's what's crazy is i'm hobbling up this hill and at the end like 90
[02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:28.840]  percent of having these incredible understandings of my family life yeah and the problem is once
[02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:32.840]  then i get the car and driving home i can't remember it right well i think that environment's
[02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:38.680]  unnatural us being in the car us being at a desk us being in studios with lights and that's the
[02:22:38.680 --> 02:22:43.800]  unnatural part the natural part puts things into perspective physical exertion breathing
[02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:48.200]  it makes you understand like what is important puts it all on perspective like what what what
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:54.360]  what do you really want out of this life what what is what means something to you and i think that
[02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:59.320]  human beings have a certain amount of physical requirements just as a human and if you don't
[02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:04.600]  meet those physical requirements if you don't get some form of exercise in i think it's very
[02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:09.720]  difficult to approach things balanced it's very i don't think you're human and believe me i'm the
[02:23:09.720 --> 02:23:14.520]  worst about this unless you're exercising because that locomotion your blood electrochemical that's
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:20.120]  part of it shifting gears you had a really big idea we were talking a few weeks ago on the phone
[02:23:20.120 --> 02:23:24.040]  the one i came out and did your podcast which is the second biggest ever i want to be number one
[02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:30.360]  and beat you on musk great guy hopefully i'll get there but you're like trying to we talked like
[02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:35.080]  an hour before we went on air for that four hour plus epic podcast and i'm just hyped about the
[02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:40.200]  podcast you're trying to really layer your rubs and really important points that when i sat back
[02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:44.440]  i thought well that's like the biggest issue there is of our time and he's talking about something
[02:23:44.440 --> 02:23:49.000]  that nobody else is talking about i mean you really were doing that and and then i watched the big
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:56.120]  podcast with the head of twitter and his lawyer they were obfuscating and dodging so much in
[02:23:56.120 --> 02:24:00.520]  lawyer speak they had a real chance to hit a home run just be honest that you never really got to your
[02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:05.560]  main point i mean i people loved it it was epic it was great but what you spend five minutes without
[02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:13.000]  me yeah i think which is hard so i've got adhd two two and a few other things to get into your big
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:17.000]  idea that after we had the podcast for four and a half hours and i'm eating steak you're trying to
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:22.360]  tell me and i'm too busy you know drinking red wine because it really is the big debate of
[02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:28.200]  you've got 90 plus percent of the internet on three or four platforms as you said at dinner
[02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:35.000]  a murderer uh gets 10 years in prison but alex jones is banned for life well not not just you but
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:42.120]  people that say learn to code get banned forever i mean there there's so listen you're gonna have
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:46.600]  before please but i but here's the thing i don't want to get lost in in jack dorsi or his lawyer
[02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:50.600]  or you being nice it's only to really go on your rant like you did at dinner because it was really
[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:55.560]  smart stuff you were saying i was like wow we should be having a discussion about pathways
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:25:00.040]  to people to get back on those platforms they're not we're kissing their ass they're gonna get sued
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:04.040]  they're gonna get attacked which i don't want to happen it's like it's like uh kennedy said those
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:09.160]  that make peaceful discussions impossible make violent revolutions inevitable to paraphrase
[02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:13.960]  so i'm not threatening violence but obviously i've got clips we're gonna play of the head of
[02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:20.040]  youtube i'm sure she's a nice lady being attacked by this journalist she's on with saying my son likes
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:25.080]  ben Shapiro so i want to ban him like alex jones and she's like well we're working on it they don't
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:29.960]  even get that they're out of the open like they're god when it's people like you and everybody else
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:35.880]  that built youtube well particularly saying ban ben Shapiro ben Shapiro is a very reasonable guy you
[02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:40.200]  can't ban someone just because you disagree with them and that's this is part of where he's beating
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:43.640]  he's beating them right this is but well it's part of the problem with the ideology that the left
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:51.960]  has they feel like because that left-leaning companies like google and facebook and apple and
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:56.200]  these tech companies are all left so i think a lot of people who are also on the left who
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:26:02.520]  disagree with people on the right like ben Shapiro they want them to ban these people ban them get
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:08.680]  away take them away that is not the answer it's never been the answer if you want to ban someone
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:14.280]  for doxing people if you want to ban someone for threatening people or harassing people these are
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:18.440]  different things you're talking about people that are doing something that could be considered a crime
[02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:23.960]  but you're you're you've got people talking about banning people for having different opinions on
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:30.120]  things you're talking about people who support certain religions like islam because they don't
[02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:36.680]  want to appear islamic phobic but they don't want to support christian religions and christian ideals
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:42.200]  with the same enthusiasm because they feel like they can shit on those religions and and it's you
[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:49.480]  know we have an open season for them in this country i think there's a real problem with people
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:55.800]  even not wanting to have discussions you you have to be able to talk to people no i agree i mean
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:26:59.880]  universities are people reasonably university is supposed to be these bashings so so so getting
[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:06.840]  into that before we get into as you're pointing this out i think she's openly saying she she's
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:12.600]  working on banning ben Shapiro i mean that that's this is the same woman that said that the james
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:20.280]  demore the google memo that she was uh upset because it reinforced harmful gender stereotypes and
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:26.760]  it's it was science even bloomberg michael bloomberg came out and said i'm not running as a democrat
[02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:32.600]  because they're all saying whites are inherently evil martin luther king said you don't judge
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:37.720]  somebody off what color they are you judge them off what they produce yeah i don't think most
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:43.880]  democrats are saying whites are inherently evil the problem is the fringe the far left are so
[02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:48.840]  loud and vocal with some of the rhetoric that everyone gets lumped into them i agree with you
[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:54.360]  reasonable left but if i turn into cnn or msnbc that's what i see joe you see some of that because
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:58.600]  they think it's acceptable i mean that's part of what it is who wants to i don't want to hate people
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:03.640]  i don't want to either i think there's a lot of sheep think going on people are seeing the tide
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:06.440]  they're licking their finger they're putting it up in the air they're finding out which way the wind
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:10.360]  is blowing and then they're going that way because it's very difficult to formulate opinions on your
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:16.200]  own it's much easier to just adopt a predetermined pattern of thinking that other people have already
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:19.960]  laid out in front of me just repeat it so so let me ask that question if it's in your industry
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:24.840]  which is what i think happened at google with james demore i think you get these group think
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:29.640]  sort of environments where these left-wing ideologies just spread throughout the company
[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:34.680]  and if you show any deviation from that you're shunned and there's a feedback more yes and
[02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:39.560]  james demore's case he was fired he's a very nice guy and a very reasonable guy and he's not sexist
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:43.240]  by any stretch of the imagination and these things have been labeled he's just not going to be the
[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:48.920]  villain because he's a male so well he's he's a scientist i mean this is really what the guy
[02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:55.480]  he's an engineer he's a he's a guy who went into the science and wrote a paper about know someone
[02:28:55.480 --> 02:29:01.080]  with a drinking or drug problem learn how to get sober after we share these stories i was 35 with
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:06.360]  two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control after my divorce
[02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:12.680]  i went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs after my
[02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:18.520]  second dwine arrest my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me i was 17 when i
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:25.000]  became addicted to heroin and meth i thought i could quit on my own but i couldn't it hit me

[02:33:12.760 --> 02:33:35.080]  you're listening to be alex jones and we are back live i just aired 20 minutes of the powerful
[02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:42.520]  joe rogan interview the full interview is up on info wars dot com we've got so much big breaking news
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:46.280]  that i'm going to air the rest of its radio and tv viewers tomorrow but if you're on the internet and
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:51.400]  want to get around the sensors and really make them upset go to info wars dot com and there it is
[02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:57.880]  posted joe rogan does a new podcast with alex jones see joe rogan's new podcast alex jones in austin
[02:33:57.880 --> 02:34:07.960]  texas and joe's really popular across the political spectrum and i got really mad at joe because he
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:12.440]  knows about the censorship knew what was going on had been anti censorship before but really wasn't
[02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:17.640]  standing up for myself and others so i got really vicious about the whole thing and then
[02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:27.880]  i saw joe really turned the corner and i'm just proud of what he did in fact let's air a few more
[02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:35.960]  minutes of joe and then i'm going to come back and get into this big breaking news here it is
[02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:42.840]  but the guy he's an engineer he's a he's a guy who went into the science and wrote a paper about
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:48.520]  the science of the differences in in general of men and women in comes to what they're interested
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:55.400]  in doing and even wrote a page and a half about strategies to encourage women to get into tech
[02:34:55.400 --> 02:35:00.840]  like he's not reinforcing harmful gender stereo you get the key he's talking about having women
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:06.840]  get an occult controlled by weird feminist leaders like the head of youtube actually pigeon holes them
[02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:11.240]  and then makes them not integrate into society it's totally sick and they're doing this in the west
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:16.520]  that's in power woman more than any other but just but even in her situation i think she is probably
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:21.640]  a product of the very environment that she works in but she's running this thing and it's a gigantic
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:28.200]  left-wing thing this think tank this mindset that permeates the entire establishment she's a part of
[02:35:28.200 --> 02:35:32.840]  it no you're right she gets sucked into it as much as anybody does it's like when you had jack dorsi
[02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:37.000]  on he goes well we have laboratories that are testing all this so if you go back to that steak
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:41.400]  dinner by your office that we had three weeks ago because in like six seven minutes you laid it all
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:47.000]  out about you know we need to create a real debate and say to them look you don't murderers don't get
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:51.720]  banned from something for life unless it's premeditated you can't do this to people this is
[02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:55.560]  going to cause a societal crisis which i don't want to have i'm not even begging to get back on
[02:35:55.560 --> 02:36:00.600]  your platforms i have my platforms it's just that i can see that it's super dangerous and now they're
[02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:05.640]  banning people's books and now they're you know now amazon's doing it so can you in your own words
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:11.720]  because it was really powerful that big idea about a road not even so much to redemption
[02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:16.680]  but a road for big tech to admit it's it's been out of control in a way that bring people back on
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:25.880]  there there has to be a place that is like twitter that is the the number one environment for global
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:32.520]  communication where both people on the right and the left can feel free to express their ideologies
[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:38.280]  feel free and and have a place where they can debate back and forth as soon as one side
[02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:42.440]  controls the narrative as soon as you have the people on the left that are silencing the people
[02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:46.200]  on the right and you know this is one of the things that came up during the podcast with uh
[02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:52.280]  vidya and jack dorsi where tim pool was saying that by saying dead naming someone or misgendering
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:57.080]  someone you can get banned for life like you're you're saying to a person perhaps maybe that someone
[02:36:57.080 --> 02:37:04.280]  has very distinct religious beliefs where they don't believe that someone is capable of transitioning
[02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:08.680]  from a man to a woman and there's no judge there's no jury you never get arrested you're just
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:16.680]  being banned and it's based on their ideology it's not based on rules that uh the our society
[02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:21.240]  agrees upon because the rules of free speech they're they're pretty clear like in the rules
[02:37:21.240 --> 02:37:25.640]  of free speech you could call someone whatever you want like that's free speech as long as you're
[02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:30.600]  not all right so the interview gets better and better the full interview is posted to info wars
[02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:35.720]  dot com and news wars dot com now a lot of people say okay yeah joe's saying free speech exists
[02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:41.720]  that's a good thing but he's doing it on a platform where he's very popular with leftist and liberals
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:50.520]  not just conservatives and hunters and uh fitness enthusiasts and ufc fans so him doing this takes
[02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:55.800]  a lot of courage and that's why i really feel good about what joe's done i went way too far in
[02:37:55.800 --> 02:37:59.640]  attacking him but once i do start attacking friends i tend to go overboard because i don't
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:04.840]  normally i do that so i have to get an emotional state just to do it then it becomes a snowball
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:13.400]  but you know now in hindsight some of the things i did uh were were over the top so i apologize
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:20.760]  for the joe for that but as very goldwater said defense radical defense of liberty extremism
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:28.280]  and defense of liberty uh is no a no vice now let me shift gears into several clips i've got here
[02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:35.480]  one is a nadler one of the democratic leaders obviously in the house spewing a bunch of bull
[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:42.440]  on a new york street corner talking to the so-called news and people are walking by saying
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:45.480]  you're a loser you're full of it you're an idiot you're trying to hold america back
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:52.200]  and there's another clip of uh trump will play first but net and yahoo just about an hour ago
[02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:58.920]  saying he hopes this doesn't happen to future presidents well that's why mr president you
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:07.400]  have to go after the crimes that were committed here that's why you have to go after komi and
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:14.440]  and the clinton's and especially mccabe who you've got red-handed strock and lisa page
[02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:20.360]  creating a fake investigation to try to remove you from office that's called a coup it's called
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:27.320]  illegal takedown it's exactly what you called it so here's the deal these criminals aren't
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:32.280]  gonna respect you unless you start going after some of them plus are you gonna sleep good at night
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:39.480]  with these individuals just getting away with this this is the boldest thing in modern world
[02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:45.080]  history it's definitely the boldest thing in most of us history stuff like this has not been pulled
[02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:51.960]  this is very rare very dangerous and i'd sleep a lot better at night if the clinton's were behind
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:40:01.560]  bars and komi got indicted and something happened to these crooks to bust open the full story of
[02:40:01.560 --> 02:40:08.120]  what they're doing inside and that's what we need i've been fighting these folks hard to try to get
[02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:12.360]  us the point of lock her up and now we're almost there and we need to complete this
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:17.720]  you know there's some monster that comes with the woods at night and occasionally you know
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:21.880]  a couple times a year tries to tear the back door off your house and eat your kids and you catch the
[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:26.680]  monster doing it and grab a machete and hack one of its arms off but it runs off into the night
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:31.560]  well if you follow the blood trail of the cave it lives in you want to go in there and make sure
[02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:35.480]  it's been dispatched completely politically through the courts i don't mean literally
[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:40.680]  hack up hillary with machete but i'm saying grindle got his arm torn off and he's gone into
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:47.240]  that nest and we think he's still alive in there in this case we know they are there's a lot of
[02:40:47.240 --> 02:40:53.000]  stuff going on in that cave who knows how bad it is we need to go in the cave like the torches
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:58.840]  and go in and i've already believed me i've already been going to these caves for a long time
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:05.560]  i found a lot of nasty stuff and our children aren't safe unless we finish the job because
[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:14.360]  grindle's got a mama and mama is going to pull some stuff so i suggest we go ahead and go face mama
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:17.880]  and just get this over with there's always going to be problems always going to be enemies well
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:24.760]  anyways here's the present i will tell you i love this country i love this country as much as i
[02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:31.800]  can love anything my family my country my god but what they did it was a false narrative who was
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:39.320]  it was a terrible thing we can never let this happen to another president again i can tell
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:46.840]  you that i say it very strongly very few people i know could have handled it we can never ever
[02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:52.360]  let this happen to another president again and what about tucker carlson said
[02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:58.760]  when roger stone no russia collusion no russia him they claim he lied to congress saying he directly

[02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:29.320]  well you heard a few hours ago that michael abinadi was indicted now he's been arrested

[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:41.880]  to obama's stonewalling and delay and arresting reporters remember that we're on the press i
[02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:46.120]  know when you have a memory stuff's just crazy but the left really believes trumps arresting all
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:55.240]  these reporters and a nazi i'm sorry um austin is the world capital of allergies it's it's it's
[02:47:55.240 --> 02:48:02.840]  recognized around the world is having the highest concentrations of pollen of anywhere except strangely
[02:48:02.840 --> 02:48:11.400]  enough you think it's like the amazon no noxville tennessee has a lot of different plants and flora
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:20.360]  and fauna so i grew up in dallas and it was mainly grassy plains up there and i had friends that
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:26.360]  wouldn't want to go out and play baseball they wouldn't want to go ride motorcycles you know
[02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:30.040]  dirt bikes they'd say i got allergies i thought that was a hypochondriac thing
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:36.600]  or we playing football and kids noses were running and i'm like you know eighth grade like what are
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:40.680]  you a wimp because i got sick like every five years or something you know the flu
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:47.960]  and then i moved to austin in about two years and i live in here
[02:48:50.280 --> 02:48:54.600]  i did a couple years of high school here a couple in dallas i was like mom i've been sick for two
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:59.560]  weeks i i just feel like i'm sick around my favorite she goes yeah you got cedar fever cedars out right
[02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:05.880]  now it's really a mountain juniper so that happens a couple times a year and then i get over it and
[02:49:05.880 --> 02:49:11.000]  then i forget oak hits at this time so you saw me earlier had to go back to the Joe Rogan interview
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:14.440]  even though i wasn't gonna play at that point because i couldn't talk i was coughing and i
[02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:20.520]  didn't have a drink and daria walks in and talks about really the sleeper product here
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:25.560]  that i never talk about that i never promote that doesn't make you feel like you're high like claret
[02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:32.200]  and d or zyrtec because those will knock out your cedar fever your stuff in my experience
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:38.200]  but also makes you feel like hell pollen block is from a special type of quail eggs
[02:49:39.480 --> 02:49:44.920]  and it's patented all we do is search what's the best-selling highest rated but it's not popular
[02:49:44.920 --> 02:49:51.320]  in the u.s this is in europe's popular so we private label the highest quality here in the u.s
[02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:56.040]  it's got a new bottle bottle was red i said let's make the red the bottle baby blue and yellow so
[02:49:56.040 --> 02:50:03.320]  we did and we don't why me that decision but here it is um seasonal discomfort support pollen block
[02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:09.080]  and you got to go read about this because the first day you take it you get a result of like 30
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:15.160]  minutes but it's in my experience cuts back maybe half your symptoms but in my experience a couple
[02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:19.560]  days into taking it why i forget to take it i'm crazy one reason was it was sold out for months
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:24.040]  and the bottle i had at home was gone so i'm gonna stockpile this post take two of these babies
[02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:30.280]  and look at me a team of viewers you chew these up and they hit within 30 minutes
[02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:34.440]  and don't taste bad either not sweet
[02:50:38.200 --> 02:50:40.920]  no additives no preservatives no nothing
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:47.560]  these special quail they learn that people that live in these areas of france
[02:50:48.920 --> 02:50:52.920]  and you ate these quail eggs there's a French eat a lot of quail eggs a lot of quail period
[02:50:52.920 --> 02:50:59.880]  didn't get allergies sat back in the 50s and they've learned to people try to breed these
[02:50:59.880 --> 02:51:04.600]  certain type of quail other places it doesn't work it's got to be from France and it's then
[02:51:04.600 --> 02:51:08.920]  they're just immersed in pollen and dust and these birds that the seeds they eat their body
[02:51:08.920 --> 02:51:17.480]  just knows how to deal with it and somehow then whatever the protein is in the egg shell is transferred
[02:51:17.480 --> 02:51:26.040]  to you and it's amazing pollen bark from info wars life and it gets into what it does help support
[02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:31.560]  sinus function helps enhance respiratory function promotes clear airway passes and normal breathing
[02:51:31.560 --> 02:51:37.400]  promotes respiratory health and normal breathing supports eye comfort and sinus health powerful
[02:51:37.400 --> 02:51:46.920]  ingredients inside include your bottle of um life immune wall include quail egg concentrate
[02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:53.720]  in decades ago researchers in france discovered the ability of certain quail eggs to alleviate
[02:51:53.720 --> 02:52:00.040]  seasonal related symptoms when eaten and sorbitol tooth friendly low calorie sugar
[02:52:00.040 --> 02:52:11.240]  and it just goes on from there get your pollen block today and i think you'll be pleasantly
[02:52:11.240 --> 02:52:19.960]  surprised 4.7 stars 94 reviews and i i'm told it works basically for everybody but you've
[02:52:19.960 --> 02:52:23.960]  got experience of yourself why not try it you're supporting the broadcast so you really can't lose
[02:52:23.960 --> 02:52:30.600]  okay i said i'm gonna get the paul's report so will johnson will be okay i'm going to uh
[02:52:32.360 --> 02:52:36.600]  go ahead and do part of the second segment so i can get paul's report out and then will johnson
[02:52:36.600 --> 02:52:40.840]  will take over so we'll start the second segment with paul joseph lotton's the truth about russia
[02:52:40.840 --> 02:52:49.560]  collusion it's very powerful and a lot more but let's go ahead and go to congressman nadler
[02:52:49.560 --> 02:52:55.400]  and this needs to happen when the democrats go out to their constituents when they go to balls
[02:52:55.400 --> 02:52:59.640]  when they go to events when they're on local radio you should call in when they're out in
[02:52:59.640 --> 02:53:04.040]  the public don't be vicious don't be hateful let's just bill clinton you know say hey you're a rapist
[02:53:05.240 --> 02:53:09.560]  but just point out what scum they are because they're telling anti for a lot and run aside
[02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:14.520]  of restaurants and run aside of grocery stores and run aside of gas stations don't don't run them
[02:53:14.520 --> 02:53:20.520]  out of places and if they're with their family leave them alone when they're eating dinner with
[02:53:20.520 --> 02:53:27.400]  their family but they get up by themselves to leave or they're going outside go over and tell
[02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:32.520]  them hey i don't like what you're doing i don't appreciate it we see through you that's it we're
[02:53:32.520 --> 02:53:37.400]  not going to lower ourselves their level but we're going to do stuff like this so here's nadler we
[02:53:37.400 --> 02:53:43.000]  try to exercise executive privilege but it won't be successful executive privilege must be asserted
[02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:50.360]  by the president personally and um and as the nixon case in front of the supreme court which was
[02:53:50.360 --> 02:53:59.480]  decided nine to nothing pointed it pointed out executive privilege cannot be used to shield
[02:53:59.480 --> 02:54:07.000]  or hide wrongdoing in the case of nixon the tapes of his personal conversations with people were
[02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:11.560]  ordered revealed by the court so i don't think that executive privilege will be very successful
[02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:18.840]  defense here okay the question is another question is the speaker and leader schumer
[02:54:18.840 --> 02:54:23.640]  or tonight question would they say is the attorney general's bias is that fair and do you have
[02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:28.840]  confidence in the attorney general well it is fair and in fact my question is if you listen to what i
[02:54:28.840 --> 02:54:37.880]  said so there he is continuing to act like trump's guilty of something when there's nothing there
[02:54:37.880 --> 02:54:42.280]  and then they criminally surveilled him during the campaign when he was president-elect when
[02:54:42.280 --> 02:54:47.080]  he was president they got caught lying about it and they committed all these crimes we must go on
[02:54:47.080 --> 02:54:54.600]  the offense or they're going to continue to pull the criminal actions it's incredible and we must
[02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:59.560]  stop google it's openly according to top computer scientists that they've published the results we
[02:54:59.560 --> 02:55:04.760]  can all see it ourselves not even showing you conservative candidates showing you lies saying
[02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:10.600]  all the republicans in key states are nazis it says party affiliation nazi party
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:14.760]  it's crazy
[02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:21.320]  and then google gets caught helping build weapon systems for china
[02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:27.320]  by the way i forgot the key point getting into pollen block
[02:55:27.320 --> 02:55:35.720]  i was telling you why darry came in and said take your pollen block i forget with allergies
[02:55:35.720 --> 02:55:39.560]  because i won't take claret and i won't take these other things because it makes me a speed freak
[02:55:39.560 --> 02:55:44.120]  and makes me rude a few times i have anger issues it's when i go bad i got horrible allergies
[02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:47.720]  let me take a claret and let me take a and this is not a drug this is this is what mother nature
[02:55:47.720 --> 02:55:52.520]  gave you these quell eggs that eat these certain diets that then have something secreted that's an
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:57.160]  anti-histamine that nature gave us it's like tumorics this great you know anti-inflammatory god
[02:55:57.160 --> 02:56:05.000]  gave us with our bodies but my point is i'm just like you i forget because we sold out of it and
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:11.400]  we didn't have it and that i didn't have it for during the allergies that i should have stockpiled
[02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:16.920]  it i don't think i made that point that oh yeah i've got something i can take for this that actually
[02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:21.480]  works for me that was the point i wanted to add about pollen block store-wide free shipping

[03:00:14.200 --> 03:00:30.120]  so
[03:00:36.840 --> 03:00:39.400]  folks we're back live here and i was just googling my name
[03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:46.520]  i mean i was uh just checking stuff out here and i noticed media matters has put out their
[03:00:46.520 --> 03:00:52.360]  latest bs spin you just document cam shot here if you need to alex jones reacts to miller report
[03:00:52.360 --> 03:00:58.600]  summary by expressing his willingness to execute traders then they go on to claim that i'm talking
[03:00:58.600 --> 03:01:06.920]  about rachel madow none of that is true that is all more garbage uh what happens is we got a great
[03:01:06.920 --> 03:01:12.840]  crew in here but we don't script everything like an hour long cnn show where every graphic that goes
[03:01:12.840 --> 03:01:17.160]  up is exactly what we mean to show or whatever everybody's seeing mainstream news but the wrong
[03:01:17.160 --> 03:01:24.920]  graphics up i was talking about how jeff bezos who i'm always critical of for a lot of reasons
[03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:29.640]  never sold us out to china never helped round up political dissidents never ran slave factories
[03:01:29.640 --> 03:01:36.200]  as as bad as some of their problems are and how i'm sick of being called a trader
[03:01:37.400 --> 03:01:42.760]  because traders get executed and i said and it's not my department that people ever found guilty
[03:01:42.760 --> 03:01:48.840]  of treason to execute folks but that you know if if we found heads of american companies were
[03:01:48.840 --> 03:01:54.120]  actually chinese agents i'd kick the levers all day and somebody in there because it's you know
[03:01:54.120 --> 03:01:57.240]  and i'm not mad at them it's the way the show works i can have it where i have to prove a graphic
[03:01:57.240 --> 03:02:01.240]  was surfing through their punching buttons you see it all the time where a pop up pops up or
[03:02:01.240 --> 03:02:06.200]  there's the wrong picture and they move it it's part of the fun of live tv rachel madow pops up
[03:02:06.200 --> 03:02:11.240]  because we just been talking about rachel madow crying over russia gate so they got all these
[03:02:11.240 --> 03:02:15.720]  channels all these computer screens open somebody punched that up so during me talking about traders
[03:02:15.720 --> 03:02:23.160]  at google madow pops up and that turns into i want to hang rachel madow no i don't wish any harm
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:31.640]  upon rachel madow and media matters knows that it's just absolutely never ends with these people
[03:02:31.640 --> 03:02:41.240]  and how deceptive they are but that's what they do that's who they are and people know that's who
[03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:47.160]  they are and you read the media matters comments people are like how do you go and you like me and
[03:02:47.160 --> 03:02:52.760]  the platform you like me and shut down it's all coming out what's happened you're getting in trouble
[03:02:52.760 --> 03:02:59.400]  you're losing your corrupt lawyers are going to jail the deplatforming of info wars in a sick way
[03:02:59.400 --> 03:03:04.920]  because of our listeners standing firm taking action got bigger i'm more mobbed on the street
[03:03:04.920 --> 03:03:11.560]  positively there before i went into a cafe at 10 30 in the morning to have a late breakfast brunch
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:18.440]  with my wife and my oldest daughter and no one was in there but just through the window
[03:03:18.440 --> 03:03:25.800]  no people saw me and 10 year old kids and seven year old kids with their parents came in and wanted
[03:03:25.800 --> 03:03:33.160]  autographs and when i walked outside people wanted to shake my hand it's not working but
[03:03:33.160 --> 03:03:39.880]  with the left they don't care they want the simulation in their mind that we've been defeated
[03:03:40.520 --> 03:03:45.560]  and they believe in their own echo bubble world that if they lie about me and lie about what i've
[03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:51.640]  said about sandy hook and things that it has this big effect only with npr and cnn viewers
[03:03:51.640 --> 03:03:56.360]  who are already believing everything you tell them they believe i'm a russian agent they believe
[03:03:56.360 --> 03:04:04.040]  all this crap so it's incredible it's not working anymore i don't believe in any offensive violence
[03:04:05.880 --> 03:04:12.040]  they had the pentagon the fbi and the cia investigate me as a trader punishable by execution
[03:04:12.040 --> 03:04:18.600]  and i said google and apple are working in china to engage in high treason
[03:04:19.960 --> 03:04:25.720]  and that they need to be charged that they need to be indicted they need to be brought to justice
[03:04:26.280 --> 03:04:33.480]  and you tear that into rachel maddow good try has nothing to do with rachel maddow
[03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:36.840]  more than they popped her up for a minute i just don't want to sound like i'm bashing on the crew
[03:04:36.840 --> 03:04:40.520]  i'm not talking about rachel maddow i'm not about anybody found guilty of treason
[03:04:40.520 --> 03:04:46.600]  she's just guilty of being a propagandist i didn't do it but from now on when my gut tells me i'm
[03:04:46.600 --> 03:04:51.000]  going to do it because hey the crew's great but they stuff like that happens and you got 20 channels
[03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:59.320]  up i was talking the globalist the eugenicists are always talking down to us they're always trying
[03:04:59.320 --> 03:05:05.400]  to make us feel small to feel insignificant they try to censor because they fear you and
[03:05:05.400 --> 03:05:10.920]  don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions they
[03:05:10.920 --> 03:05:16.600]  want you to believe you're powerless but the truth is it is we the people and our ideas
[03:05:16.600 --> 03:05:23.880]  and our actions and and what we say and what we do that changes the world we are the power structure
[03:05:23.880 --> 03:05:31.800]  we are the inventors we are the trailblazers and the globalists understand that and they understand
[03:05:31.800 --> 03:05:36.680]  that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people
[03:05:37.720 --> 03:05:41.640]  now to help fund our operation that's undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists
[03:05:42.520 --> 03:05:46.920]  i want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of

[03:07:23.880 --> 03:07:29.800]  by way of this great crew the amazing job that they do as well then the war room is coming up in t
[03:07:29.800 --> 03:07:35.480]  minus 53 minutes with oan shroyer his co-host is roger stone but he's a political president so
[03:07:35.480 --> 03:07:40.440]  he can't come on right now there's been a lot of other insane developments today obviously
[03:07:41.400 --> 03:07:45.240]  and we're trying to gauge what's happening there and deal with it but we're in the thick of the
[03:07:45.240 --> 03:07:52.360]  fight for this country but we're we're in sudden death over time with the globalist toe to toe
[03:07:52.360 --> 03:07:57.080]  but we have the initiative and we're driving down the field and they don't know what to do
[03:07:57.080 --> 03:08:07.240]  it's like a 99 yard drive and we're 10 yards from the end zone right now
[03:08:07.240 --> 03:08:12.520]  you'd feel the energy and the enemy had such horrible plans for all of us they love to bully
[03:08:12.520 --> 03:08:17.000]  kids they love to target the unborn now the born but everything slips through their hands right now
[03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:22.120]  they don't know what to do the inferiority complex of the evil ones they just are beside
[03:08:22.120 --> 03:08:26.440]  themselves because they were finally about to rule earth let's go ahead and go to paul watch's report
[03:08:26.440 --> 03:08:34.120]  then will johnson so the same media that relentlessly calls me a fake news conspiracy theorist just
[03:08:34.120 --> 03:08:39.800]  spent the last two years pushing what turned out to be the biggest fake news conspiracy theory
[03:08:39.800 --> 03:08:45.880]  since saddam hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction who's the conspiracy theorist now
[03:08:45.880 --> 03:08:53.080]  as rollingstone's matt tiebe writes russia gay is this generation's wmd wmd damaged the media's
[03:08:53.080 --> 03:09:00.680]  reputation russia gay may have destroyed it the same media that abuses its platform to de-platform
[03:09:00.680 --> 03:09:07.640]  and silence others for fake news and misinformation when they generated and hyped the largest most
[03:09:07.640 --> 03:09:14.040]  harmful piece of fake news and misinformation for two years solid facebook twitter and youtube have
[03:09:14.040 --> 03:09:21.480]  all vowed to crack down on fake news and conspiracy theories cnn msnbc the new york times the washington
[03:09:21.480 --> 03:09:27.000]  posts and every late night comedian all threw their weight behind a conspiracy theory that
[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:33.560]  caused division across the country and undermined democracy what punishment will they face will
[03:09:33.560 --> 03:09:39.640]  their channels be deleted will they be relegated in the algorithm don't hold your breath alex jones
[03:09:39.640 --> 03:09:45.240]  was wiped out for saying something he apologized for yet the mass media pushed a narrative that
[03:09:45.240 --> 03:09:51.480]  destabilized the nation and could have sparked a war and nothing will happen to them none of them
[03:09:51.480 --> 03:09:57.480]  will be held accountable for two years solid every night they told us that the trump administration
[03:09:57.480 --> 03:10:02.840]  was on the verge of collapse breaking news a bombshell today is a turning point today was
[03:10:02.840 --> 03:10:07.720]  historically bad for president trump today was a turning point a turning point we're a turning

[03:10:37.480 --> 03:10:42.680]  the tipping point i know we've said it over and over you think this is a tipping point and over
[03:10:42.680 --> 03:10:47.880]  and over this is a tipping point and over and over breaking news president trump off the rails
[03:10:47.880 --> 03:10:52.040]  there's a beginning of the end today the beginning of the end breaking news tonight new bombshell

[03:10:57.320 --> 03:11:02.200]  in the walls closing in the two years solid they breathlessly told us that the president had
[03:11:02.200 --> 03:11:08.440]  conspired with a hostile nation to steal an election russia russia vladimir putin russia russia russia
[03:11:08.440 --> 03:11:13.980]  russia hate russia russia russia putin russia's Russia russia russia russia russian russian

[03:11:36.280 --> 03:11:38.140]  Vladimir Putin Russia Vladimir Putin
[03:11:38.140 --> 03:11:41.080]  Russia Putin Putin in Russia Russia Moscow Russia
[03:11:41.080 --> 03:11:45.940]  Russian Russia Russia the Russians Russians Russians Russia Russia Russian Russian Russia
[03:11:45.940 --> 03:11:49.440]  Russia Putin Putin Putin Putin Russian Russian Russia
[03:11:49.440 --> 03:11:55.020]  And exactly as I said over two years ago, it all turned out to be complete bonk.
[03:11:55.020 --> 03:12:03.180]  40 FBI agents, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 witnesses, 500 search warrants, 230 communications records,
[03:12:03.180 --> 03:12:10.440]  50 phone taps, 13 foreign government intel requests, no collusion, no evidence of obstruction.
[03:12:10.440 --> 03:12:14.200]  The media lied to you again and again and again.
[03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:18.000]  They peddled the biggest fake news hoax in a generation.
[03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:23.520]  While pointing their fingers at people like me, demanding we be silenced for fake news,
[03:12:23.520 --> 03:12:28.560]  for people screaming about Trump working for Russia, are the same people demanding social
[03:12:28.560 --> 03:12:31.240]  media censor misinformation.
[03:12:31.240 --> 03:12:33.760]  Stop listening to these people.
[03:12:33.760 --> 03:12:38.520]  If you're an MSNBC viewer or reader of liberal sites on the internet, you were fed a steady
[03:12:38.520 --> 03:12:44.080]  stream of conspiratorial bullshit that completely warped your view of the world, all while they
[03:12:44.080 --> 03:12:49.680]  purposely excluded anyone who questioned their fraud and profited off of your fears.
[03:12:49.680 --> 03:12:54.520]  Many of them are so delusional that even after the Mueller report completely debunked their
[03:12:54.520 --> 03:13:00.320]  conspiracy theory, even after being totally humiliated, they're still claiming there was
[03:13:00.320 --> 03:13:01.320]  Russian collusion.
[03:13:01.320 --> 03:13:02.320]  I'm not owned.
[03:13:02.320 --> 03:13:03.320]  I'm not owned.
[03:13:03.320 --> 03:13:07.240]  I continue to insist as I slowly shrink and transform into a corn cob.
[03:13:07.240 --> 03:13:11.440]  Russian collusion conspiracy theorists are the flat earthers of politics.
[03:13:11.440 --> 03:13:12.720]  They won't apologize.
[03:13:12.720 --> 03:13:15.160]  They won't reflect on their hysteria.
[03:13:15.160 --> 03:13:17.640]  Their hysteria will only be elevated.
[03:13:17.640 --> 03:13:19.000]  No one will be fired.
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:20.400]  No one will be disciplined.
[03:13:20.400 --> 03:13:24.800]  Are you ever going to have a single moment of self-awareness?
[03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:28.400]  Are you ever going to stop being parties and hacks?
[03:13:28.400 --> 03:13:31.680]  Are you ever going to realize the reason you lost the election?
[03:13:31.680 --> 03:13:34.760]  Wasn't Russian Facebook ads or Twitter bots?
[03:13:34.760 --> 03:13:41.080]  It was because you fielded an unpopular candidate who embodied a neoliberal, elitist agenda
[03:13:41.080 --> 03:13:43.840]  that the entire world is now rejecting.
[03:13:43.840 --> 03:13:48.360]  And after having spent the last two years hyping the importance and credibility of the
[03:13:48.360 --> 03:13:53.200]  Mueller report, they're now telling everyone to disregard the Mueller report.
[03:13:53.200 --> 03:13:54.800]  I don't care what's in that report.
[03:13:54.800 --> 03:13:56.720]  This is like Brexit all over again.
[03:13:56.720 --> 03:13:57.720]  What do you want to do?
[03:13:57.720 --> 03:14:01.920]  You're doing investigation after investigation until you get the result you want.
[03:14:01.920 --> 03:14:07.640]  The only way the conspiracy theory can survive is by metastasizing into an even bigger conspiracy.
[03:14:07.640 --> 03:14:10.360]  Now Mueller himself was part of the conspiracy.
[03:14:10.360 --> 03:14:14.120]  Hey Democrats, maybe now drop the conspiracy theories.
[03:14:14.120 --> 03:14:17.800]  Maybe drop demonizing half of the American population.
[03:14:17.800 --> 03:14:23.920]  Maybe drop the relentless, frothing hysteria and the endless contrived moral panics.
[03:14:23.920 --> 03:14:29.080]  Maybe now, oh I don't know, become an actual political party with policies that actually
[03:14:29.080 --> 03:14:31.320]  resonate with the American people.
[03:14:31.320 --> 03:14:32.320]  Just an idea.
[03:14:32.320 --> 03:14:33.320]  A media.
[03:14:33.320 --> 03:14:38.480]  Instead of abusing your platforms to silence your competition and destabilize democracy,
[03:14:38.480 --> 03:14:44.520]  maybe go back to doing actual non-partisan unbiased journalism.
[03:14:44.520 --> 03:14:45.520]  Just an idea.
[03:14:45.520 --> 03:14:49.880]  All right, that's editor-at-large from FullWars.com, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:14:49.880 --> 03:14:53.280]  Will Johnson's taking over the next segment, but let me show you this.
[03:14:53.280 --> 03:15:00.480]  In Herald, time to ban the collusion conspiracy theorist, and they go on to say the Democrats
[03:15:00.480 --> 03:15:07.880]  should all be banned off Twitter, Facebook, Google, because Alex Jones was for misinformation.
[03:15:07.880 --> 03:15:13.480]  No, I was for questioning real things, and they shouldn't get banned for questioning.
[03:15:13.480 --> 03:15:18.960]  They should get arrested for creating the fake investigation and trying to plant evidence,
[03:15:18.960 --> 03:15:19.960]  which has now come out.
[03:15:19.960 --> 03:15:21.160]  We have the text messages.
[03:15:21.160 --> 03:15:22.400]  We have the proof.
[03:15:22.400 --> 03:15:25.800]  That's how they get prosecuted trying to bring the president down in an orchestrated
[03:15:25.800 --> 03:15:26.800]  coup.
[03:15:26.800 --> 03:15:27.800]  An inside job.
[03:15:27.800 --> 03:15:28.800]  What did Trump call it?
[03:15:28.800 --> 03:15:29.800]  A takedown.
[03:15:29.800 --> 03:15:33.720]  They can sit up there and say, the moon's made of cheese, and Trump's a Easter Bunny
[03:15:33.720 --> 03:15:36.800]  or a Russian agent that wears fur caps.
[03:15:36.800 --> 03:15:40.200]  That's their right to do, but they can't collude with the government to try to overturn the
[03:15:40.200 --> 03:15:42.840]  election knowing it's a fraud.
[03:15:42.840 --> 03:15:47.160]  So now they're using the left's citizenship of me to call for the left to be censored.
[03:15:47.160 --> 03:15:49.560]  No, let's not turn into them.
[03:15:49.560 --> 03:15:53.280]  Phil Johnson coming up.
[03:15:53.280 --> 03:15:57.000]  Pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:15:57.000 --> 03:16:00.080]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay heating pads.
[03:16:00.080 --> 03:16:03.760]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill, so what's so good about Sunny Bay heating
[03:16:03.760 --> 03:16:04.760]  pads?
[03:16:04.760 --> 03:16:10.200]  Sunny Bay heating pads, made by Biomed DB Design right here in the USA, come in all sizes.
[03:16:10.200 --> 03:16:14.960]  Our extra large, microwavable heating pad for back pain is designed to be large enough
[03:16:14.960 --> 03:16:16.880]  to cover your entire back.
[03:16:16.880 --> 03:16:20.480]  It's also perfect to wrap around your legs, knees, or shoulder and neck.

[03:17:59.280 --> 03:18:06.200]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major
[03:18:06.200 --> 03:18:07.200]  city.
[03:18:07.200 --> 03:18:10.880]  There's some of the most polluted areas on earth, our major cities.

[03:18:54.240 --> 03:18:58.560]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[03:18:58.560 --> 03:19:02.840]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[03:19:02.840 --> 03:19:03.920]  Believe me, I know.
[03:19:03.920 --> 03:19:08.800]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day,
[03:19:08.800 --> 03:19:14.080]  but thanks to SupermailVitality at Infowarsstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:19:14.080 --> 03:19:18.280]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[03:19:18.280 --> 03:19:22.440]  the chemicals and the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with
[03:19:22.440 --> 03:19:27.440]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[03:19:27.440 --> 03:19:34.680]  and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:19:34.680 --> 03:19:38.680]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get SupermailVitality before it's gone.

[03:20:18.400 --> 03:20:20.600]  You are watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.600 --> 03:20:22.360]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:20:22.360 --> 03:20:26.440]  I will be standing in for Alex Jones for the rest of the show here.
[03:20:26.440 --> 03:20:27.760]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:20:27.760 --> 03:20:28.760]  Thank you for staying with us.
[03:20:28.760 --> 03:20:31.560]  There's a lot happening in the news.
[03:20:31.560 --> 03:20:33.800]  I'm pretty sure everyone is aware of the Mueller report.
[03:20:33.800 --> 03:20:36.680]  Of course, Alex Jones was just talking about it.
[03:20:36.680 --> 03:20:40.760]  Awesome report from Paul Watson.
[03:20:40.760 --> 03:20:42.760]  And there's so much going on.
[03:20:42.760 --> 03:20:45.520]  It's almost like I don't know where to start.
[03:20:45.520 --> 03:20:49.360]  But where I'm going to start is with Ilhan Omar.
[03:20:49.360 --> 03:20:56.480]  Just past weekend, I was in LA where she was speaking at a care event.
[03:20:56.480 --> 03:21:03.040]  And at this care event, we had roughly over a thousand people that are Americans that
[03:21:03.040 --> 03:21:09.760]  were there protesting against care for hosting this event with Ilhan Omar.
[03:21:09.760 --> 03:21:16.960]  Ilhan Omar, she's the one that has the whole anti-Semitic statements against Israel.
[03:21:16.960 --> 03:21:24.120]  And it's already been proven that Ilhan Omar and care absolutely worked together with Hamas
[03:21:24.120 --> 03:21:26.760]  as a terrorist organization.
[03:21:26.760 --> 03:21:30.720]  It's kind of remarkable to me that we have a terrorist organization that's operating
[03:21:30.720 --> 03:21:33.960]  within side of the borders of the United States.
[03:21:33.960 --> 03:21:36.040]  And it's not even a secret.
[03:21:36.040 --> 03:21:44.400]  But because of the Democratic Party policies, they've embraced and endorsed this whole anti-Semitic.
[03:21:44.400 --> 03:21:47.400]  They came out with a whole resolution trying to make it look like that they're not hateful
[03:21:47.400 --> 03:21:49.560]  towards Jewish people.
[03:21:49.560 --> 03:21:55.400]  Even our president, Donald J. Trump, came out with a statement talking about how the Democratic
[03:21:55.400 --> 03:22:00.160]  Party does not like the Jewish community, which is a true statement.
[03:22:00.160 --> 03:22:02.120]  They've demonstrated it multiple times.
[03:22:02.120 --> 03:22:06.800]  Even when President Trump moved the embassy to Jerusalem, the Democrats were not happy
[03:22:06.800 --> 03:22:08.080]  about it.
[03:22:08.080 --> 03:22:13.520]  Every time President Trump put in policies trying to protect the American people against
[03:22:13.520 --> 03:22:18.160]  Muslims that want to come destroy the country, and not all Muslims are bad, President Trump
[03:22:18.160 --> 03:22:23.640]  has already admitted that, but they get upset every time President Trump tried to do something
[03:22:23.640 --> 03:22:26.680]  that's going to protect the American people.
[03:22:26.680 --> 03:22:29.600]  Because of this, we are where we are.
[03:22:29.600 --> 03:22:36.200]  I was in LA this past weekend, and like I said, there was over a thousand people protesting
[03:22:36.200 --> 03:22:41.160]  against Ilhan Omar, and she came out with a statement, and I'm going to play this video
[03:22:41.160 --> 03:22:49.440]  clip for you about the American people standing outside protesting against her, and her statement
[03:22:49.440 --> 03:22:53.840]  is completely bonkers, if you ask me.
[03:22:53.840 --> 03:22:59.520]  So without me continuing going on, bumbling, rumbling on, I'm going to show you this clip
[03:22:59.520 --> 03:23:07.160]  with Ilhan Omar, and how she's addressing us, the American people outside of this care
[03:23:07.160 --> 03:23:08.160]  event.
[03:23:08.160 --> 03:23:12.520]  So I'm going to put this on the screen for you, and you can see it here, so just listen
[03:23:12.520 --> 03:23:14.400]  to what she says here.
[03:23:14.400 --> 03:23:22.560]  There are very fascinating people outside, who for so many years have spoken about an
[03:23:22.560 --> 03:23:35.480]  Islam that is oppressive, an Islam that lessons and isolates its women, and today they gather
[03:23:35.480 --> 03:23:41.480]  outside to protest a Muslim woman who is in Congress.
[03:23:41.480 --> 03:23:45.480]  Stay attention, she says.
[03:23:45.480 --> 03:23:53.640]  I mean, the irony, the irony in that is very entertaining to me.
[03:23:53.640 --> 03:24:02.640]  I know, I know many of them drove miles to get here, spent a lot of energy and resources
[03:24:02.640 --> 03:24:10.360]  and money to purchase the signs that they have, but I don't think any of them realize
[03:24:10.360 --> 03:24:16.040]  that people like myself and many of the people in this room can care less about what they
[03:24:16.040 --> 03:24:17.960]  have to say.
[03:24:17.960 --> 03:24:24.540]  Really, really, worse, she cared less, her and the people in the room care less what
[03:24:24.540 --> 03:24:27.200]  Americans have to say.
[03:24:27.200 --> 03:24:29.360]  Did you hear?
[03:24:29.360 --> 03:24:30.360]  She just said it.
[03:24:30.360 --> 03:24:32.120]  I'm not putting words in her mouth.
[03:24:32.120 --> 03:24:36.000]  She straight up said that she could care less, her and the people in the room could care
[03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:40.880]  less on what Americans have to say.
[03:24:40.880 --> 03:24:45.520]  And if we, and if we're supposed to believe what she's saying as truth, that we should
[03:24:45.520 --> 03:24:51.640]  care less what Americans have to say, that should send a signal to everybody in this
[03:24:51.640 --> 03:24:56.240]  country that they do not care about America.
[03:24:56.240 --> 03:25:00.120]  Now the people that were standing out there, they're not there for Islam.
[03:25:00.120 --> 03:25:04.080]  They didn't come to the protest, this whole rally because of, they want to show their
[03:25:04.080 --> 03:25:05.640]  support for Islam.
[03:25:05.640 --> 03:25:07.760]  They're speaking out against Islam.
[03:25:07.760 --> 03:25:14.280]  And then she says, she's finding ironic that she's Muslim and she's in Congress.
[03:25:14.280 --> 03:25:19.640]  Now to my understanding, unless it has changed, you have to be, you have to be an American
[03:25:19.640 --> 03:25:23.720]  citizen in order to be a member of Congress.
[03:25:23.720 --> 03:25:29.760]  So be her being a American citizen and now she's a member of Congress is the only reason
[03:25:29.760 --> 03:25:33.600]  why she is a Congresswoman.
[03:25:33.600 --> 03:25:35.520]  So she left that part out.
[03:25:35.520 --> 03:25:40.160]  Now if she was in the Middle East, would she have the same rights?
[03:25:40.160 --> 03:25:45.680]  Would she be able to stand before the men that was at this event and speak to them with
[03:25:45.680 --> 03:25:48.000]  authority?
[03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:49.000]  Think about that.
[03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:51.840]  See, that's the part that she's leaving out.
[03:25:51.840 --> 03:25:58.200]  Of course, you're a woman, you're in America, you have rights, you have every means necessary,
[03:25:58.200 --> 03:26:04.720]  you have every ability to become somebody, you have every rights to become a Congresswoman.
[03:26:04.720 --> 03:26:07.440]  That's what America is about.
[03:26:07.440 --> 03:26:11.840]  It's not the Republicans, it's not the American people that want to keep women suppressed.
[03:26:11.840 --> 03:26:13.120]  It is Islam.
[03:26:13.120 --> 03:26:18.760]  If you went over to the Middle East, she would not be in the position she's in right now.
[03:26:18.760 --> 03:26:25.760]  The only reason why she's there, because she's where in America, the United States of America.
[03:26:25.760 --> 03:26:27.720]  That's the only reason.
[03:26:27.720 --> 03:26:29.160]  It's really a no-brainer.
[03:26:29.160 --> 03:26:34.840]  And see, the people in there, they're not hearing that, so they're only going based on
[03:26:34.840 --> 03:26:35.840]  what she's saying.
[03:26:35.840 --> 03:26:44.200]  The whole objective here is to convince the American people that Islam is for women, which
[03:26:44.200 --> 03:26:47.280]  we all know is not.
[03:26:47.280 --> 03:26:50.320]  Would she be willing to take the hijab off?
[03:26:50.320 --> 03:26:53.680]  Would she be willing to take the thing off her head off?
[03:26:53.680 --> 03:26:54.840]  Why not show her hair?
[03:26:54.840 --> 03:27:01.800]  And has she been presented with the question about Israel having their freedom, Israel being
[03:27:01.800 --> 03:27:04.040]  a state?
[03:27:04.040 --> 03:27:08.880]  She's come out multiple times with her hatred toward Israel.
[03:27:08.880 --> 03:27:15.640]  And can you imagine how she feels with President Trump showing his support for Israel?
[03:27:15.640 --> 03:27:17.880]  Never before in the history of this nation.
[03:27:17.880 --> 03:27:22.920]  We've had other presidents in the past saying that they're going to do X, Y, Z for Israel
[03:27:22.920 --> 03:27:27.320]  and does nothing, zero, not a zip.
[03:27:27.320 --> 03:27:32.400]  But here it is, President Trump keeping his word.
[03:27:32.400 --> 03:27:34.800]  That is the major problem.
[03:27:34.800 --> 03:27:37.760]  That is the major problem when it comes to the Democrats.
[03:27:37.760 --> 03:27:43.840]  You have a president of the United States keeping his word and they don't like it.
[03:27:43.840 --> 03:27:48.800]  Just to give you a really quick brief, you have the central for security policy.
[03:27:48.800 --> 03:27:55.520]  They even came out with a statement showing how care is a domestic terrorist group.
[03:27:55.520 --> 03:27:56.520]  They laid out the proof.
[03:27:56.520 --> 03:27:58.920]  There's documentation on it.
[03:27:58.920 --> 03:28:04.080]  They've already lined it out for all of us to see.
[03:28:04.080 --> 03:28:05.760]  What more do you need to see?
[03:28:05.760 --> 03:28:07.600]  What more evidence do you need to see?
[03:28:07.600 --> 03:28:08.880]  It is all there.
[03:28:08.880 --> 03:28:13.200]  She just plainly laid it out that she's not here for the American people.
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:15.200]  She's here for Islam.
[03:28:15.200 --> 03:28:20.800]  For her, the sharia comes above all other things.
[03:28:20.800 --> 03:28:22.480]  Sharia is the one.
[03:28:22.480 --> 03:28:24.120]  Sharia is the only one for them.
[03:28:24.120 --> 03:28:26.800]  Okay, so we're going to go to a break here.
[03:28:26.800 --> 03:28:30.840]  But before we go, I want to say this, infowars.com.
[03:28:30.840 --> 03:28:33.560]  Go to infowars.com and check out the supplements.
[03:28:33.560 --> 03:28:36.160]  They have beautiful things.

[03:28:42.120 --> 03:28:45.960]  I actually have some of the protein bars.
[03:28:45.960 --> 03:28:46.960]  They are fulfilling.
[03:28:46.960 --> 03:28:47.960]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:28:47.960 --> 03:28:53.320]  The Alex Jones show will be right back after this short break.
[03:28:53.320 --> 03:28:57.040]  Pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:57.040 --> 03:29:00.040]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay heating pads.

[03:30:54.120 --> 03:30:56.240]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:30:56.240 --> 03:30:57.240]  Go ahead.
[03:30:57.240 --> 03:31:01.560]  Well, I just have to say something, man, it seems like every time I turn on your broadcast,
[03:31:01.560 --> 03:31:02.560]  you're bracking.
[03:31:02.560 --> 03:31:03.560]  It just gets old, man.
[03:31:03.560 --> 03:31:06.840]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[03:31:06.840 --> 03:31:09.080]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:31:09.080 --> 03:31:13.240]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:31:13.240 --> 03:31:15.800]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:31:15.800 --> 03:31:18.760]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:31:18.760 --> 03:31:21.520]  I mean, what's it going to take, us being shut down?
[03:31:21.520 --> 03:31:22.520]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:31:22.520 --> 03:31:23.520]  You know what, Alex?
[03:31:23.520 --> 03:31:24.520]  I'll put it on pause again.
[03:31:24.520 --> 03:31:25.520]  Hey, Frank!
[03:31:25.520 --> 03:31:31.000]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack,
[03:31:31.000 --> 03:31:32.000]  we need your help?
[03:31:32.000 --> 03:31:36.320]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:31:36.320 --> 03:31:39.280]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:31:39.280 --> 03:31:40.280]  Do you understand?
[03:31:40.280 --> 03:31:41.520]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:31:41.520 --> 03:31:43.840]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:31:43.840 --> 03:31:48.880]  Go to InfowarsStore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[03:31:48.880 --> 03:31:50.120]  Do you understand?
[03:31:50.120 --> 03:31:51.840]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:31:51.840 --> 03:31:53.920]  Free press needs your help, Frank!
[03:31:53.920 --> 03:31:57.880]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:57.880 --> 03:32:02.400]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[03:32:02.400 --> 03:32:07.840]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:07.840 --> 03:32:13.200]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[03:32:13.200 --> 03:32:14.760]  to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:14.760 --> 03:32:21.280]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:21.280 --> 03:32:25.280]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[03:32:25.280 --> 03:32:26.600]  in the rainwater.
[03:32:26.600 --> 03:32:32.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[03:32:32.000 --> 03:32:38.080]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:38.080 --> 03:32:43.680]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[03:32:43.680 --> 03:32:49.040]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:49.040 --> 03:32:57.320]  And more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:57.320 --> 03:33:14.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.760 --> 03:33:17.320]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.320 --> 03:33:18.640]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:33:18.640 --> 03:33:23.640]  I am hosting this last hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.640 --> 03:33:26.920]  Thank you for coming back and staying with us.
[03:33:26.920 --> 03:33:32.240]  The last segment I was talking about, Ilhan Omar, and the event that she had in LA this
[03:33:32.240 --> 03:33:33.800]  past weekend.
[03:33:33.800 --> 03:33:37.160]  And one of the things that I wanted to show you was, and I actually am going to put up
[03:33:37.160 --> 03:33:45.960]  on the screen here, this was the security, this was the central for security policy.
[03:33:45.960 --> 03:33:51.120]  And on their website, they show that car is Hamas, and they actually have the documentation
[03:33:51.120 --> 03:33:55.240]  where they prove that they are a terrorist group.
[03:33:55.240 --> 03:33:59.080]  And I'm not going to go through everything on here, but one of the things that people
[03:33:59.080 --> 03:34:05.960]  should realize is that even the founder of this car organization, they even came out
[03:34:05.960 --> 03:34:11.480]  with a statement talking about how they say they believe, and I'm going to read this word
[03:34:11.480 --> 03:34:12.480]  for word.
[03:34:12.480 --> 03:34:19.720]  And I quote, he says, it is important to mislead Americans about the future and the nature
[03:34:19.720 --> 03:34:22.520]  of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:34:22.520 --> 03:34:29.080]  It is support, and it supports the terrorist acts against Israel.
[03:34:29.080 --> 03:34:32.800]  So they don't want people to realize that, they don't want people to know that.
[03:34:32.800 --> 03:34:35.000]  That's the part that's really amazing about all this.
[03:34:35.000 --> 03:34:39.440]  The documentation is out there, they're no longer hiding it, it's in plain sight and
[03:34:39.440 --> 03:34:41.880]  the Democrats are actually embracing it.
[03:34:41.880 --> 03:34:44.240]  That's the scary part about all of this.
[03:34:44.240 --> 03:34:49.440]  So, but the main topic today, the main story that's buzzing around, well, actually, there
[03:34:49.440 --> 03:34:51.720]  should be two main topics buzzing around.
[03:34:51.720 --> 03:34:55.080]  And I'm going to get to that second topic here in just a minute.
[03:34:55.080 --> 03:34:59.120]  But the main one that everyone is talking about, all the mainstream news media, the
[03:34:59.120 --> 03:35:06.000]  outlets, Info Wars, Breitbart, Drudge Report, all of them is the Russia, no collusion.
[03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:08.960]  It should just be called that, Russia, no collusion.
[03:35:08.960 --> 03:35:14.560]  So the Democrats for the last two years have been attacking the president day in and day
[03:35:14.560 --> 03:35:19.440]  out as long as they can to get at the president.
[03:35:19.440 --> 03:35:25.080]  Never in the history of this world or this country, rather, have the Democrats, the mainstream
[03:35:25.080 --> 03:35:31.520]  media, even some Republicans have done everything they could to take out the president of the
[03:35:31.520 --> 03:35:34.360]  United States.
[03:35:34.360 --> 03:35:44.440]  So this whole Russia collusion has been more than $25 million, our dollars, spent.
[03:35:44.440 --> 03:35:48.920]  Now everyone who hears that should be highly upset.
[03:35:48.920 --> 03:35:50.960]  Do we get a refund?
[03:35:50.960 --> 03:35:53.080]  Does that money come back to us?
[03:35:53.080 --> 03:35:54.080]  I think not.
[03:35:54.080 --> 03:35:56.160]  It's just money gone.
[03:35:56.160 --> 03:35:58.160]  I mean, they spent this money.
[03:35:58.160 --> 03:36:00.560]  I mean, where are the checks and balances at?
[03:36:00.560 --> 03:36:05.360]  I mean, President Trump came out, it's a total witch hunt.
[03:36:05.360 --> 03:36:10.600]  And everybody's talking about it and everyone should pay attention to what's happening here.
[03:36:10.600 --> 03:36:16.120]  It's completely despicable, 2,800 subpoenas.
[03:36:16.120 --> 03:36:24.120]  No collusion, mind you, after the 2,800 subpoenas, 2,800.
[03:36:24.120 --> 03:36:26.440]  Think about the number 2,800 subpoenas.
[03:36:26.440 --> 03:36:39.280]  And the man hours, it took for 2,800 subpoenas with no collusion, 500 witnesses, really,
[03:36:39.280 --> 03:36:42.520]  500 witnesses, and where's the collusion?
[03:36:42.520 --> 03:36:46.320]  There is still no collusion after 500 witnesses.
[03:36:46.320 --> 03:36:54.600]  And you know what's really amazing about all of it is that with shifty shift, knowing that
[03:36:54.600 --> 03:37:00.720]  there's no collusion after the report coming out, shifty shift is upset.
[03:37:00.720 --> 03:37:02.920]  The Democrat Party's upset.
[03:37:02.920 --> 03:37:09.960]  The liberal media is upset that there is no collusion.
[03:37:09.960 --> 03:37:13.000]  So now they're going with obstruction.
[03:37:13.000 --> 03:37:16.440]  See they have been talking about obstruction before the report came out.
[03:37:16.440 --> 03:37:19.960]  And the main reason I believe that they've been talking about obstruction before the report
[03:37:19.960 --> 03:37:25.160]  came out, because they knew for a fact there was no Russia collusion.
[03:37:25.160 --> 03:37:27.080]  They knew it.
[03:37:27.080 --> 03:37:28.400]  It was already spelled out.
[03:37:28.400 --> 03:37:33.480]  Don't forget about Nancy Pelosi talking about, well, you know what, we need to move on.
[03:37:33.480 --> 03:37:35.760]  How long ago she just did that recently?
[03:37:35.760 --> 03:37:37.640]  A lot of people don't even know that.
[03:37:37.640 --> 03:37:40.080]  A lot of people don't even realize that.
[03:37:40.080 --> 03:37:41.440]  She just admitted.
[03:37:41.440 --> 03:37:45.320]  So now they're going with the whole obstruction of justice.
[03:37:45.320 --> 03:37:51.840]  How in the world would President Trump have to do obstruction when he did nothing wrong?
[03:37:51.840 --> 03:37:53.360]  Think about that.
[03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:58.480]  You know, if someone says that, hey, you just stole that car and you got the license and
[03:37:58.480 --> 03:38:06.760]  registration to the VHCOO, and if you don't show someone who's just making up these lies,
[03:38:06.760 --> 03:38:11.960]  your license and registration, they're saying that you're obstructing.
[03:38:11.960 --> 03:38:15.640]  Then if they get a subpoena and they do all this stuff, they do this report, they go down
[03:38:15.640 --> 03:38:19.720]  to the DMV and they find out that you actually own the vehicle, they're going to say that
[03:38:19.720 --> 03:38:24.640]  you were obstructing because you didn't want to show them your license and registration.
[03:38:24.640 --> 03:38:26.120]  I'm not talking about a police officer.
[03:38:26.120 --> 03:38:29.040]  I'm talking about someone who's made up this whole thing.
[03:38:29.040 --> 03:38:30.640]  That's exactly what this is.
[03:38:30.640 --> 03:38:32.520]  Oh, you're obstructing.
[03:38:32.520 --> 03:38:36.840]  So now they don't have any collusion with Russia.
[03:38:36.840 --> 03:38:39.040]  So let's make, let's go with Russia.
[03:38:39.040 --> 03:38:40.280]  Let's say that he obstructed.
[03:38:40.280 --> 03:38:41.640]  It's the witch hunt.
[03:38:41.640 --> 03:38:44.400]  They're not going to stop the witch hunt.
[03:38:44.400 --> 03:38:46.480]  This whole witch hunt is going to continue.
[03:38:46.480 --> 03:38:49.960]  It's not going to stop.
[03:38:49.960 --> 03:38:52.080]  They are completely upset by it.
[03:38:52.080 --> 03:38:57.440]  So I have a short clip that I want to play of Shifty Shift after he found out, and this
[03:38:57.440 --> 03:39:04.300]  is from Sunday, with Shifty Shift complaining about his whole thing about Russia collusion
[03:39:04.300 --> 03:39:08.480]  and how they're not going to stop because they're moving on to obstruction now.
[03:39:08.480 --> 03:39:13.960]  And I don't know if you recall a while back where Shifty Shift said that, well, if they
[03:39:13.960 --> 03:39:17.920]  come out and they find out in the report, basically, I'm paraphrasing here, they come
[03:39:17.920 --> 03:39:23.620]  out and they find out that there was no collusion, we're going to have our own investigation.
[03:39:23.620 --> 03:39:27.160]  So basically, this is how you put it.
[03:39:27.160 --> 03:39:34.840]  Basically you have this whole Russia collusion is dead, is done in the casket, buried, funeral.
[03:39:34.840 --> 03:39:38.680]  The Democrats and Shifty Shift and the rest of them, even the liberal media, they're going
[03:39:38.680 --> 03:39:42.160]  to dig up that casket and have their own funeral.
[03:39:42.160 --> 03:39:46.020]  They're going to dig up those bones and look at the same bones that everyone been looking
[03:39:46.020 --> 03:39:50.080]  at for the last two years and say, try to come up with something else different about
[03:39:50.080 --> 03:39:55.040]  this dead body that's in this casket and have their own funeral.
[03:39:55.040 --> 03:39:56.880]  That's the insanity of all of this.
[03:39:56.880 --> 03:39:58.600]  So let me put this clip up here.
[03:39:58.600 --> 03:40:04.120]  This is what our Shifty Shift, Congressman Shifty Shift, check this out.
[03:40:04.120 --> 03:40:10.080]  You know, the biggest news from Robert Mueller so far is that there are no new indictments
[03:40:10.080 --> 03:40:15.240]  for that underlying any cooperation and conspiracy with the Russians to interfere in our elections.
[03:40:15.240 --> 03:40:19.840]  And we're already seeing Rudy Giuliani come out with a tweet yesterday about that citing
[03:40:19.840 --> 03:40:20.840]  you.
[03:40:20.840 --> 03:40:23.520]  He said your previous statement saying there's significant evidence of collusion involving
[03:40:23.520 --> 03:40:24.680]  the Trump campaign.
[03:40:24.680 --> 03:40:28.640]  I trust he, Adam Shift, is relieved there is no collusion and I hope he will apologize
[03:40:28.640 --> 03:40:29.640]  for his mistake.
[03:40:29.640 --> 03:40:30.640]  We all make them.
[03:40:30.640 --> 03:40:31.640]  The real virtue is to admit it.
[03:40:31.640 --> 03:40:32.640]  It would help us heal.
[03:40:32.640 --> 03:40:35.080]  You can apologize?
[03:40:35.080 --> 03:40:40.000]  I think Mr. Giuliani would be wise to wait until the report is made public before making
[03:40:40.000 --> 03:40:42.080]  any pronouncements about vindication.
[03:40:42.080 --> 03:40:45.080]  You have said though in the past there is significant evidence of collusion.
[03:40:45.080 --> 03:40:50.280]  How do you square that with Robert Mueller's decision not to indict anyone?
[03:40:50.280 --> 03:40:54.440]  And there is significant evidence of collusion and we've set that out time and time again
[03:40:54.440 --> 03:40:59.240]  from the secret meetings in Trump Tower to the conversations between Flynn, the Russian
[03:40:59.240 --> 03:41:03.600]  ambassador to the providing a polling data to someone linked to Russian intelligence
[03:41:03.600 --> 03:41:07.240]  and Stone's conversation with WikiLeaks and the GRU through.
[03:41:07.240 --> 03:41:09.640]  None of them prosecuted.
[03:41:09.640 --> 03:41:11.920]  No, that's true.
[03:41:11.920 --> 03:41:16.680]  None of them was prosecuted and he go, no, that's true.
[03:41:16.680 --> 03:41:18.480]  There's nothing there.
[03:41:18.480 --> 03:41:20.120]  It's a nothing burger.
[03:41:20.120 --> 03:41:22.920]  They still can't get over the fact that they can't get anything.
[03:41:22.920 --> 03:41:30.200]  They're digging up dead bones, trying to make something out of these dead bones.
[03:41:30.200 --> 03:41:37.760]  Even Lindsey Graham is now talking about how come they didn't investigate the other side.
[03:41:37.760 --> 03:41:38.760]  Right?
[03:41:38.760 --> 03:41:44.760]  I mean, seriously, if you really want to talk about Russia collusion, when you want to look
[03:41:44.760 --> 03:41:54.080]  into the fake steel dossier, did all of this start with the dossier, the Pfizer report?
[03:41:54.080 --> 03:42:00.720]  I mean, when they went to the Pfizer court, did they question about this information?
[03:42:00.720 --> 03:42:06.680]  Is that information in the full Mueller report about the dossier?
[03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:08.520]  I mean, what started it?
[03:42:08.520 --> 03:42:12.880]  They were investigating a candidate running for president, someone that was working on
[03:42:12.880 --> 03:42:15.640]  the campaign and didn't inform them.
[03:42:15.640 --> 03:42:22.120]  Lindsey Graham even brought up the fact how when Diane Feinstein was saying what she was
[03:42:22.120 --> 03:42:23.120]  saying.
[03:42:23.120 --> 03:42:26.240]  And I'm going to talk a little bit more about that on the other side of this break.
[03:42:26.240 --> 03:42:31.640]  Diane Feinstein even did what she did talking about she has someone working with her with
[03:42:31.640 --> 03:42:36.520]  China, but she let him go because the FBI let her know about it, but they didn't let
[03:42:36.520 --> 03:42:38.600]  President Trump know about it.
[03:42:38.600 --> 03:42:41.040]  More on the other side is break.
[03:42:41.040 --> 03:42:42.320]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:42:42.320 --> 03:42:44.320]  This is the Alex Jones show.

[03:45:34.120 --> 03:45:36.920]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back
[03:45:36.920 --> 03:45:42.800]  And I mean, I don't know what's gonna happen to me in the future. I mean all I know is I want to go with the master built
[03:45:42.800 --> 03:45:45.360]  I want to go to the next level. I want to be with the
[03:45:45.800 --> 03:45:52.120]  Spirit that I've experienced not these devil worshipers. They're cold and failed and feels like being a tomb. I want life
[03:45:52.120 --> 03:45:53.680]  I want Jesus
[03:45:53.680 --> 03:46:00.520]  There are thousands of ideologies out there hundreds of different political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist
[03:46:01.680 --> 03:46:04.560]  Info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist
[03:46:04.840 --> 03:46:09.440]  That's what the globalists are obsessed with it trying to shut it down. I didn't invent all this
[03:46:09.440 --> 03:46:11.440]  I went and researched the Renaissance
[03:46:11.640 --> 03:46:16.960]  Americana and what really works for humanity and I'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold
[03:46:16.960 --> 03:46:19.200]  It's super popular like it's always been
[03:46:19.200 --> 03:46:26.160]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the light in the dark of the night
[03:46:26.160 --> 03:46:29.000]  That's since chills up my spine. So whatever you do
[03:46:29.440 --> 03:46:36.240]  Continue to support yourself and info wars by buying the great products and info or store com by spreading the articles by spreading the videos and
[03:46:36.240 --> 03:46:43.720]  By praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment for myself and the whole info wars family
[03:46:43.720 --> 03:46:49.200]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done because without you info wars is nothing
[03:46:49.280 --> 03:46:52.120]  You are the info war and I salute you
[03:46:52.120 --> 03:47:10.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:47:14.080 --> 03:47:17.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. My name is will Johnson
[03:47:17.880 --> 03:47:25.640]  Thank you for joining us. Thank you for staying with us. Absolutely wonderful things crazy things happen in the world right now today
[03:47:26.640 --> 03:47:31.320]  Russia, there's no Russia collusion once again. The last segment I was talking about how
[03:47:31.920 --> 03:47:35.200]  Diane Feinstein had someone working under her and
[03:47:36.240 --> 03:47:38.920]  FBI informed her and they let that person go
[03:47:39.360 --> 03:47:45.720]  They did not do the same thing under President Trump and Lindsey Graham today made that quite clear in his statement today
[03:47:45.720 --> 03:47:51.600]  Another thing that he mentioned. I thought it was very important to get it across is that he said that
[03:47:51.960 --> 03:47:57.880]  Americans that hate the fact that President Trump did not collude or upset. They hate this country
[03:47:58.680 --> 03:48:00.680]  Why would you be upset if?
[03:48:01.320 --> 03:48:07.520]  President Trump did not collude, right? They don't even sound right, but Americans that are happy
[03:48:08.040 --> 03:48:10.520]  That he did not collude. They love this country
[03:48:10.520 --> 03:48:15.400]  Think about that. This is that it goes both ways. It's absolutely insanity
[03:48:16.040 --> 03:48:23.320]  Here it is showing that the president did not do anything wrong and they're upset. It's like they want the president to do something wrong
[03:48:24.360 --> 03:48:29.880]  We know why they want to do something wrong. They want to do something wrong because they can't stand him doing the right thing for this country
[03:48:29.880 --> 03:48:34.200]  They can't stand that he's a positive thing for this country. They just want him out
[03:48:34.200 --> 03:48:39.400]  They want to impeach him by any means necessary impeach the president impeach the president
[03:48:39.400 --> 03:48:43.160]  Get rid of them. Get rid of them. We don't like him. We don't like him
[03:48:44.760 --> 03:48:45.720]  So
[03:48:45.720 --> 03:48:47.720]  with President Trump
[03:48:48.600 --> 03:48:51.080]  Being you know, basically, there's no collusion
[03:48:51.880 --> 03:48:54.920]  America has the cloud just lifted off of it
[03:48:55.480 --> 03:49:00.920]  The Democrats still have this thundercloud over them and they're upset because the rest of us see the light
[03:49:01.400 --> 03:49:06.280]  We're in the sunshine. The birds are chirping the flowers are blooming
[03:49:06.280 --> 03:49:11.160]  The flowers are blooming and for some reason the Democrats can't stand that fact
[03:49:11.800 --> 03:49:16.600]  This is a sad day in America for them. But it's a great day for America as a whole
[03:49:17.400 --> 03:49:22.200]  And we all should be celebrating. Isn't this what we wanted? I remember two years ago
[03:49:22.680 --> 03:49:28.360]  When people were complaining about President Trump saying wait until the Mueller report comes out wait until the Mueller report comes out
[03:49:28.360 --> 03:49:35.720]  Well, the Mueller report comes out and they don't like the fact that there has been no Russia collusion the truth of it
[03:49:36.520 --> 03:49:39.960]  the reality of it there is no Russia collusion and
[03:49:40.360 --> 03:49:46.200]  We've all seen how the Democrats demonstrate how they like reality in the year 2019
[03:49:46.920 --> 03:49:48.920]  They argue they fight with reality
[03:49:49.960 --> 03:49:52.360]  Two plus two for them no longer equals four
[03:49:53.080 --> 03:49:57.480]  Then they're trying to convince everybody that it equals five and if you say otherwise then hey
[03:49:57.480 --> 03:49:59.480]  You're going to be attacked
[03:50:00.040 --> 03:50:03.240]  They want to remove you from social media. They want to remove you from
[03:50:03.880 --> 03:50:10.200]  You know various networks because you're speaking your mind. You're telling the truth. You can't we can't have that
[03:50:11.320 --> 03:50:13.320]  Think about that
[03:50:13.320 --> 03:50:15.320]  This is the where we live in
[03:50:15.400 --> 03:50:20.200]  So with Russia collusion going on what no Russia collusion going on. I want to show you something here
[03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:22.120]  this is
[03:50:22.120 --> 03:50:24.120]  this is from part of the report from
[03:50:24.120 --> 03:50:31.400]  The attorney general and attorney general made it clear and because he made it clear about this
[03:50:31.480 --> 03:50:36.920]  They're upset they the Democrats are upset because they said he did not take enough time
[03:50:37.640 --> 03:50:39.640]  To go through the Mueller report himself
[03:50:40.440 --> 03:50:41.400]  as if
[03:50:41.400 --> 03:50:43.400]  He needed more time
[03:50:43.560 --> 03:50:45.560]  He probably asked Mueller
[03:50:45.800 --> 03:50:50.680]  Did you find anything that proved that there was anything close to Russia collusion?
[03:50:50.680 --> 03:50:56.760]  And Mueller probably told him more than likely said no, there was absolutely nothing. It was zero
[03:50:57.640 --> 03:51:04.520]  Evidence that showed Russia collusion. So it made it pretty simple. This two year the past two years 25 million
[03:51:05.160 --> 03:51:07.160]  dollars plus later
[03:51:07.320 --> 03:51:09.080]  No, Russia collusion
[03:51:09.080 --> 03:51:11.080]  And what do you expect?
[03:51:11.560 --> 03:51:16.360]  Him to make up something say, you know what whether might be possibly something but there's no more indictments coming
[03:51:16.360 --> 03:51:20.440]  So you can't make something up. So just let's watch look at this
[03:51:21.320 --> 03:51:23.320]  this is
[03:51:23.320 --> 03:51:26.760]  Part of the report that came from the attorney general
[03:51:27.320 --> 03:51:31.880]  And it says the special counsel's report is divided into two parts
[03:51:32.680 --> 03:51:38.760]  The first describes the results of the special counsel's investigation into russia's interference in the
[03:51:39.400 --> 03:51:41.400]  2016 us presidential election
[03:51:41.400 --> 03:51:49.320]  The report outlines russia's efforts to influence the election and documents crimes committed by persons
[03:51:49.720 --> 03:51:55.000]  Associated with the russian government connected to those with those efforts
[03:51:55.880 --> 03:51:58.520]  the report further explains that the primary
[03:52:00.200 --> 03:52:08.680]  Consideration for the special counsel's investigation was whether any americans including individuals associated with the trump campaign
[03:52:09.320 --> 03:52:10.600]  joined
[03:52:10.600 --> 03:52:13.160]  The russia conspiracy to influence the election
[03:52:13.800 --> 03:52:16.120]  Which would be a federal crime?
[03:52:17.000 --> 03:52:19.960]  the special counsel's investigation did not
[03:52:21.080 --> 03:52:27.960]  Find that the trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with russia
[03:52:28.360 --> 03:52:32.920]  In its efforts to influence the 2016 us presidential election
[03:52:32.920 --> 03:52:40.360]  As the report states the investigation did not establish that members of the trump campaign
[03:52:40.840 --> 03:52:44.600]  Conspired or coordinated with the russian government in its
[03:52:45.720 --> 03:52:49.720]  Inference activities. So we all can agree that
[03:52:50.520 --> 03:52:59.480]  Russia does try to hack america america tries to hack russia america tries to hack israel israel tries to hack america
[03:52:59.480 --> 03:53:03.960]  allies hack each other to let each other know about open holes
[03:53:04.600 --> 03:53:06.360]  In their firewall
[03:53:06.360 --> 03:53:08.200]  It's a common practice
[03:53:08.200 --> 03:53:11.800]  Here in silicon valley where i'm at it is a common practice
[03:53:12.200 --> 03:53:18.120]  They hack each other to find different things and they that's one way that allies help each other throughout the world
[03:53:18.680 --> 03:53:25.320]  Doesn't mean that the enemies don't do it and one thing they're talking about saying, you know, even even uh, lindsay gramps said today that
[03:53:25.320 --> 03:53:31.800]  Is show proof that russia hacked the dnc and my question to that to would be to lindsay gramps
[03:53:32.520 --> 03:53:40.760]  When the fbi went to the dnc was the fbi actually able to see the servers that were hacked because the last time i looked
[03:53:41.000 --> 03:53:44.280]  The dnc refused to allow the fbi to view the servers
[03:53:44.920 --> 03:53:46.840]  It's a valid question
[03:53:46.840 --> 03:53:50.600]  To me it's a valid question. They seem to forget about sith rich
[03:53:50.600 --> 03:53:56.200]  You know and they said that roger stone connection with wiki leaks is his connection to russia. I mean
[03:53:57.240 --> 03:54:02.040]  Seriously, you can say that about all of us my connection to russia is i'm on the same planet
[03:54:02.920 --> 03:54:04.520]  i mean really
[03:54:04.520 --> 03:54:05.800]  really
[03:54:05.800 --> 03:54:08.200]  They make they make up everything out of everything
[03:54:08.840 --> 03:54:10.840]  And the the left they're still
[03:54:11.320 --> 03:54:12.440]  so
[03:54:12.440 --> 03:54:13.800]  but hurt
[03:54:13.800 --> 03:54:18.600]  That president trump is still the president with no collusion. They don't know how to handle it
[03:54:18.600 --> 03:54:24.840]  So I have another quick video that i'm going to share with you and this is what our favorite person here in california
[03:54:26.040 --> 03:54:28.040]  maxine waters
[03:54:28.440 --> 03:54:33.160]  She is still losing it. She's completely losing it. Let's check this out really quick here
[03:54:33.800 --> 03:54:40.360]  Maxine waters our favorite person this president has a way of trying to get into people's heads
[03:54:40.600 --> 03:54:44.600]  And indoctrinate them. He's been saying no collusion no collusion no collusion
[03:54:44.600 --> 03:54:49.320]  Over and over again for a long time now and he's going to try and conclude
[03:54:49.960 --> 03:54:53.560]  That there this report is proving that there's no collusion
[03:54:53.800 --> 03:55:00.040]  And you have a lot of his sycophants who will you know take the nod from him and they'll say the same thing
[03:55:00.600 --> 03:55:05.480]  But we cannot allow them to get away with this. He does this all the time
[03:55:05.880 --> 03:55:13.880]  This is not the end of anything. This is the well it's the end of the report and the investigation by moeller
[03:55:13.880 --> 03:55:20.360]  But those of us who chair these committees have a responsibility to continue with our oversight
[03:55:21.560 --> 03:55:28.280]  There's so much uh that needs to be uh, you know, it's the end of the it's the end of the democrats is what it is
[03:55:28.760 --> 03:55:31.240]  It's the end of the democrats. They they're done
[03:55:32.360 --> 03:55:38.600]  It's it should be the end of cnn msnbc and the rest of them for two years. They pushed this fake news
[03:55:38.600 --> 03:55:43.000]  Over and over it. It should be the end of the left
[03:55:44.200 --> 03:55:48.120]  If you ask me the democrats have played too many cars
[03:55:48.280 --> 03:55:52.760]  They got they got caught with too many cars up their sleeve cheating lying
[03:55:54.440 --> 03:55:57.080]  They colluded with russia not president trump
[03:55:58.040 --> 03:55:59.480]  They're done
[03:55:59.480 --> 03:56:01.480]  It's finished. They're finished
[03:56:01.480 --> 03:56:08.120]  We're going to drill this horse until the horse can't even be drilled any longer the dead horse
[03:56:08.600 --> 03:56:13.240]  Because the russia collusion is dead. It's over and people need to recognize what happened
[03:56:14.040 --> 03:56:17.800]  So like I said in the beginning of this, there's one other thing that I think we should be addressing
[03:56:18.280 --> 03:56:20.120]  And it should be all over the news
[03:56:20.120 --> 03:56:27.000]  But because of the whole russia collusion thing is shadowing and that is the interview with alex jones and joe rogan
[03:56:27.720 --> 03:56:29.720]  is so important
[03:56:29.720 --> 03:56:32.680]  That everyone views that video
[03:56:33.320 --> 03:56:35.320]  You share that video
[03:56:35.720 --> 03:56:39.720]  Go to the info wars.com. It's on the main page. You can see it right there
[03:56:40.280 --> 03:56:44.840]  You have to share that video. See with all the censorship that's going on
[03:56:45.160 --> 03:56:50.200]  They do not want us to pay attention to the real issues that's affecting all of us
[03:56:50.200 --> 03:56:55.000]  This russia collusion is not even a real issue. The real issue is how they're censoring
[03:56:56.120 --> 03:56:56.680]  Americans
[03:56:56.680 --> 03:57:00.360]  If they truly cared about americans, they will spend a hundred percent
[03:57:01.000 --> 03:57:08.040]  Drilling down the censorship that's taking place in america. It's nazi germany all over again. It's that for physical books
[03:57:08.120 --> 03:57:13.800]  They are burning digital books. It's digital books that they're burning here in the united states
[03:57:14.440 --> 03:57:17.800]  My name is will johnson. This is the alex jones show
[03:57:18.440 --> 03:57:21.480]  So much information is never enough time to get it all out
[03:57:21.960 --> 03:57:24.920]  Coming up next is the war room with owens shawyer

[03:57:37.560 --> 03:57:39.560]  info wars.com
[03:57:43.240 --> 03:57:49.800]  There are thousands of ideologies out there hundreds of different political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist
[03:57:49.800 --> 03:57:57.000]  Info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist. That's why the globalists are obsessed with it trying to shut it down
[03:57:57.400 --> 03:58:03.480]  I didn't invent all this. I went and researched the renaissance americana and what really works for humanity
[03:58:03.640 --> 03:58:08.440]  And i'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold. It's super popular like it's always been
[03:58:09.400 --> 03:58:15.480]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the light in the dark of the night
[03:58:15.480 --> 03:58:22.040]  That's since chills up my spine. So whatever you do continue to support yourself and info wars by buying the great products
