[00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:02.636]  We've got it.
[00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:08.439]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:12.842]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:18.465]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:27.819]  I would be surprised if, for example, this week on Friday, he is going to be delivering what I think are going to be his indictments, the final indictments.
[00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:32.402]  I would not be surprised if there were a number of indictments that still were going to come down the pike.
[00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:35.825]  There are indictments in this president's future.
[00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:36.725]  That's a bombshell.
[00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:37.546]  The bombshell.
[00:00:37.546 --> 00:00:38.287]  This bombshell.
[00:00:38.287 --> 00:00:39.367]  Drop the bombshell.
[00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:40.728]  Bombshell accusation.
[00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:41.949]  Bombshell accusation.
[00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:42.310]  This is...
[00:00:43.286 --> 00:00:45.988]  Evidence of willingness to commit collusion.
[00:00:45.988 --> 00:00:54.034]  If this BuzzFeed News report is true, then we are likely on our way to possible impeachment proceedings.
[00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:57.216]  If this story is true, we must begin impeachment proceedings.
[00:00:57.216 --> 00:00:58.657]  This is suborning perjury.
[00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:01.219]  I think there's no question it's an impeachable offense.
[00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.802]  Man, at that point we are in high crimes and misdemeanor and we are in impeachment territory.
[00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:08.483]  This president needs to be impeached!
[00:01:08.483 --> 00:01:09.704]  Impeachment is the remedy.
[00:01:09.704 --> 00:01:11.265]  I mean, the president can't do this.
[00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:12.065]  It's the only remedy.
[00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:15.367]  The spirit of what Trump did is clearly treasonous.
[00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:20.330]  This is moving into perjury, false statements, and even potentially treason.
[00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.091]  There's outright treason.
[00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:23.892]  I mean, there is no question.
[00:01:23.892 --> 00:01:25.233]  I think he's feeling the noose around his neck.
[00:01:25.673 --> 00:01:27.114]  The noose is tightening.
[00:01:27.114 --> 00:01:29.436]  And I think they're shocked that the noose is tightening.
[00:01:29.436 --> 00:01:30.957]  He feels the noose is tightening.
[00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:32.778]  The noose is tightening.
[00:01:32.778 --> 00:01:39.703]  The sound of hoof beats of all those investigations catching up with Donald Trump must be loud in his ears.
[00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:44.426]  He may be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time.
[00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:45.667]  People might go to jail.
[00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.109]  You're exactly right.
[00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:48.169]  For the rest of their lives.
[00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:49.530]  I think they're all going to jail.
[00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.251]  Well, I think they're all going to end up together in prison and maybe that's a good thing.
[00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:56.751]  He has no idea that he's going down.
[00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:01.792]  You're confident that at least some Trump associates will wind up in jail?
[00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:03.253]  If I was betting, I would say yes.
[00:02:03.253 --> 00:02:04.793]  Donald Trump Jr.
[00:02:04.793 --> 00:02:06.153]  gave us the dots.
[00:02:06.153 --> 00:02:09.114]  All we have to do is to connect them to see where this is going.
[00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:17.527]  Ha, ha, ha!
[00:02:17.527 --> 00:02:20.309]  You see the earthquake?
[00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.291]  You got it.
[00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:25.912]  Restore the Republic?
[00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:26.713]  You got it.
[00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:29.215]  Relaunch the economy and the family?
[00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:32.097]  You got it.
[00:02:32.097 --> 00:02:34.358]  You are ghost?
[00:02:34.358 --> 00:02:43.705]  It's all coming out!
[00:02:51.144 --> 00:03:02.427]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Monday, March 25th, 2019, Global Transmission.
[00:03:02.427 --> 00:03:12.889]  And folks have made these compilations of the Democrats all going off talking points in the corporate media, regurgitating them about the walls are closing in, no doubt it's treason, he's a Russian agent.
[00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:19.711]  But I was thinking just watching that video compilation that's linked up on DrudgeReport.com, which is an excellent video compilation, off the top of my head though,
[00:03:20.913 --> 00:03:28.077]  During the break, I'm going to run back, talk to some of the crew, and remind them of 10 or 15 clubs I remember where it was worse than that.
[00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:29.098]  Russian scum!
[00:03:29.098 --> 00:03:30.299]  We're run by Russia!
[00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.399]  Trump's a Russian agent!
[00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:32.980]  Alex Jones is a Russian agent!
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.781]  Joy Behar!
[00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:35.082]  We just got the news!
[00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:37.083]  General Flynn admits they're all Russian agents!
[00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.183]  Trump's going to prison!
[00:03:38.183 --> 00:03:42.706]  Yay!
[00:03:42.706 --> 00:03:45.388]  I mean, we're going to put the real definitive
[00:03:47.824 --> 00:03:51.185]  We've got all the responses crying and freaking out, but let me break something down here.
[00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:52.326]  We told you this was all coming.
[00:03:52.326 --> 00:03:53.106]  We told you it would fail.
[00:04:07.162 --> 00:04:09.903]  The establishment isn't going to give up yet.
[00:04:09.903 --> 00:04:16.446]  We have decisive findings here by major international study groups, by groups that crunch the numbers, top professors.
[00:04:16.446 --> 00:04:21.848]  Google and the rest of the big tech is absolutely stealing elections.
[00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:26.450]  They beta tested in 2018 and they're going to steal it in 2020.
[00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.651]  This is the real collusion.
[00:04:27.651 --> 00:04:28.671]  This is the real fraud.
[00:04:28.671 --> 00:04:31.893]  This is the real meddling.
[00:04:31.893 --> 00:04:34.394]  And so we've got to get Trump moving on this direction.
[00:04:34.394 --> 00:04:36.135]  He already is going after
[00:04:37.347 --> 00:04:44.734]  The brainwashing command bases where they create the cult members, the cadet centers, the nurseries, at the universities.
[00:04:44.734 --> 00:04:53.302]  He's already going after the censorship there, but now he must move, must move decisively, against the Chi-Com enemy Google.
[00:04:53.302 --> 00:04:54.423]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:54.423 --> 00:04:55.524]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:55.524 --> 00:04:56.565]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.456]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:08.359]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.
[00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:11.002]  So this is the best deal we've ever offered.
[00:05:11.002 --> 00:05:12.583]  Free shipping storewide.

[00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:34.224]  So, we have written literally hundreds of articles in the last two years about the attempted Deep State criminal takedown.
[00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:53.893]  The 45th President of the United States, and now the whole criminal operation has been exposed.
[00:06:53.893 --> 00:07:05.262]  The emails, the text messages, the premeditation, the fact that Hillary and Obama, when Trump was President-elect within 48 hours, launched the plan.
[00:07:05.262 --> 00:07:11.366]  All of that, ladies and gentlemen, is now coming out in a very, very big way.
[00:07:11.366 --> 00:07:17.431]  And we have the President of the United States coming out.
[00:07:19.201 --> 00:07:34.533]  And pointing out that now there needs to be criminal investigations of the individuals and the groups that tried to take the presidency down in an attempted coup d'etat.
[00:07:34.533 --> 00:07:36.435]  That's what this is!
[00:07:36.435 --> 00:07:39.117]  And it sounds extreme to say that, but the Democrats admitted
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.821]  That that is what they were doing.
[00:07:41.821 --> 00:07:51.971]  But first I want to go to Joy Behar because there's been a lot of compilations out there of them celebrating and saying he's a Russian agent and he's going to go to prison and he needs to be killed.
[00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:55.795]  But none of them have added this little jewel.
[00:07:55.795 --> 00:08:00.659]  And throughout the day we're going to be playing some of the jewels that people have forgotten about in the last two years.
[00:08:00.659 --> 00:08:00.920]  Here it is.
[00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:03.841]  Breaking news.
[00:08:03.841 --> 00:08:04.521]  Oh my god.
[00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:06.023]  Oh, breaking news.
[00:08:06.023 --> 00:08:18.835]  ABC News Brian Ross is reporting Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Mueller team and is prepared to testify that as a candidate Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians!
[00:08:18.835 --> 00:08:22.419]  Yay!
[00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:23.540]  Our president's a traitor.
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.523]  We'll be able to kill the economy now.
[00:08:31.602 --> 00:08:33.883]  America was never great.
[00:08:33.883 --> 00:08:36.624]  America will never be great.
[00:08:36.624 --> 00:08:45.987]  From the very same state that these women are sitting up there like vultures on top of a 50-story building at the VIEW television platform.
[00:08:45.987 --> 00:08:46.407]  I've been there.
[00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:55.577]  I mean, even if it was true he's a Russian agent, you would get really upset about your president doing that and think, what's going to come of this?
[00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:56.637]  It's going to wreck the country.
[00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:58.337]  Of course, none of it was true.
[00:08:58.337 --> 00:09:01.258]  They're the globalists, the Democrats, the corporate media, Hollywood.
[00:09:01.258 --> 00:09:02.439]  They're in bed with the shycoms.
[00:09:02.439 --> 00:09:08.801]  They're the ones demoralizing the nation, constantly saying how much it sucks and how racist we are and how everything's horrible.
[00:09:08.801 --> 00:09:09.841]  Now we're falling apart.
[00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:14.096]  And Maxine Waters saying, don't move your factories back here.
[00:09:14.096 --> 00:09:17.881]  I'm going to reverse what Trump did.
[00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:24.050]  I'm going to bring all of the regulations back into the United States.
[00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.834]  And the economy is going straight up, it starts going sideways.
[00:09:27.705 --> 00:09:30.726]  Because the Democrats announced, we're not open for business.
[00:09:30.726 --> 00:09:33.967]  We all got stock in China and India and Mexico.
[00:09:33.967 --> 00:09:36.188]  We're about mounting America's head on the wall.
[00:09:36.188 --> 00:09:38.508]  Don't you try to make this country great again.
[00:09:38.508 --> 00:09:44.290]  We're going to stop that Russian agent from making the country great again.
[00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:56.754]  But while we all celebrate the fact that Mueller came up empty, despite all the people they tried to frame, all the illegal spying, all the people they tried to put in jail for made up things to get him to turn against the president and lie.
[00:09:58.359 --> 00:10:03.182]  They couldn't get anybody to do it because there was nothing there.
[00:10:03.182 --> 00:10:11.686]  Even when they got people like Cohen to flip, there was nothing for him to connect anything to the President because it was all made up by that dirty criminal.
[00:10:11.686 --> 00:10:14.988]  And so, Balazi Ford's failed.
[00:10:14.988 --> 00:10:17.709]  Who else has failed?
[00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:20.351]  Congressman Schiff has failed.
[00:10:20.351 --> 00:10:21.251]  Michael Moore has failed.
[00:10:21.251 --> 00:10:22.552]  Hillary Clinton's failed.
[00:10:22.552 --> 00:10:23.392]  Bill Clinton's failed.
[00:10:23.392 --> 00:10:25.053]  Barack Obama's failed.
[00:10:25.053 --> 00:10:26.054]  The globalists have failed.
[00:10:29.693 --> 00:10:30.954]  All these people.
[00:10:30.954 --> 00:10:35.277]  The list just goes on and on of all the hoaxers and all the liars.
[00:10:35.277 --> 00:10:41.742]  McCain has failed.
[00:10:41.742 --> 00:10:47.326]  It's incredible what's been going on.
[00:10:47.326 --> 00:10:51.949]  Now, you have to ask yourself, what is going to come next?
[00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:55.172]  Because we can sit here and look at the lay of the land
[00:10:56.397 --> 00:11:02.419]  And understand the Democrats are not going to ever give up.
[00:11:02.419 --> 00:11:07.061]  They've launched their Balazi Four.
[00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:10.502]  They've launched their Stormy Daniels.
[00:11:10.502 --> 00:11:15.464]  They've launched their Russiagate hoaxes.
[00:11:15.464 --> 00:11:18.305]  And they're going to launch more of them.
[00:11:18.305 --> 00:11:22.587]  But people now have seen the fact that this is the party of Jussie Smollett.
[00:11:24.209 --> 00:11:25.550]  This is the party of fraud.
[00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.292]  This is the party of liars.
[00:11:28.292 --> 00:11:39.761]  But if Trump thinks he can just now try to get the economy moving forward and that they're not going to come back after him and that he can basically try to be neutral and hopefully the Democrats become sane, he's made a big mistake.
[00:11:39.761 --> 00:11:41.442]  We now must discuss.
[00:11:41.442 --> 00:11:43.484]  We now must talk about.
[00:11:43.484 --> 00:11:50.129]  We now must debate what needs to be done.
[00:11:50.129 --> 00:11:52.470]  And justice is always the course.
[00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.851]  And Trump
[00:11:54.229 --> 00:11:55.190]  Didn't hint at that.
[00:11:55.190 --> 00:12:01.036]  He spelled it out when he talked about the fact that there's total exoneration.
[00:12:01.036 --> 00:12:04.039]  Says illegal takedown failed.
[00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:09.705]  Steve Watson article on newswars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:12:09.705 --> 00:12:14.790]  And I would ask you to get that opportunity to hear from the president himself getting on Air Force One.
[00:12:15.956 --> 00:12:32.847]  Yesterday, laying this out and saying it needs to be looked at how the Democratic Party, from Obama right down to Hillary, organized this entire operation against the President.
[00:12:32.847 --> 00:12:35.449]  Here's the President.
[00:12:35.449 --> 00:12:41.874]  After so many people have been so badly hurt, after not looking at the other side,
[00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:53.500]  Where a lot of bad things happened, a lot of horrible things happened, a lot of very bad things happened for our country.
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.501]  It was just announced.
[00:12:55.501 --> 00:12:57.963]  There was no collusion with Russia.
[00:12:57.963 --> 00:13:00.865]  The most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
[00:13:00.865 --> 00:13:04.047]  There was no collusion with Russia.
[00:13:04.047 --> 00:13:09.831]  There was no obstruction and none whatsoever.
[00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:14.134]  And it was a complete and total exoneration.
[00:13:15.784 --> 00:13:19.120]  It's a shame that our country had to go through this.
[00:13:20.655 --> 00:13:28.579]  To be honest, it's a shame that your president has had to go through this before I even got elected.
[00:13:28.579 --> 00:13:30.200]  It began.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.261]  And it began illegally.
[00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:35.423]  And hopefully somebody's going to look at the other side.
[00:13:35.423 --> 00:13:40.825]  This was an illegal takedown that failed.
[00:13:40.825 --> 00:13:45.628]  And hopefully somebody's going to be looking at the other side so it's complete.
[00:13:46.768 --> 00:13:50.850]  Exoneration, no collusion, no obstruction.
[00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:51.970]  Thank you very much.
[00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.231]  Thank you.
[00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:55.632]  Let's expand on that.
[00:13:55.632 --> 00:13:57.853]  Now the deep state's scared.
[00:13:57.853 --> 00:14:03.315]  With big tech, it's openly not working with our military, with our state governments, it's working with the Chinese.
[00:14:03.315 --> 00:14:10.698]  The decision's been made, the money's been spent, the transference of power is already happening, but Trump and America and other nationalists around the world woke up
[00:14:11.792 --> 00:14:14.934]  At the 11th hour, and now it's beginning to reverse.
[00:14:14.934 --> 00:14:17.055]  And a lot of people were confident in the globalist system.
[00:14:17.055 --> 00:14:18.156]  They thought we were done.
[00:14:18.156 --> 00:14:19.777]  Now they're not so confident.
[00:14:19.777 --> 00:14:24.160]  You're going to see Democrats turn against each other like rats leaving a sinking ship.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.182]  This is still a very, very dangerous period we're in.
[00:14:28.182 --> 00:14:35.566]  But as Trump tweeted out last year, now that Russia collusion is a proven lie, when do the trials for treason begin?
[00:14:35.566 --> 00:14:40.970]  Yeah, you can't leave all these dangerous crooks who are actually in bed with foreign governments walking around.
[00:14:41.854 --> 00:14:46.395]  Because you're now aiding and abetting them if you don't do the right thing and go after them.
[00:14:46.395 --> 00:14:49.216]  We're going to go to break.
[00:14:49.216 --> 00:14:55.338]  We're going to come back with more of these clips and get into the Google censorship now confirmed that stole the 2018 elections.
[00:14:55.338 --> 00:14:59.379]  They've had top scientists, universities crunch the numbers, professors.
[00:14:59.379 --> 00:15:00.279]  They did it.
[00:15:00.279 --> 00:15:03.840]  And it turns out Google bragged to Hillary they can deliver the election to her.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.661]  It's just the tsunami was so big of Trump that he barely won.
[00:15:08.865 --> 00:15:10.586]  Even though he had a landslide.
[00:15:10.586 --> 00:15:11.746]  So they miscalculated.
[00:15:11.746 --> 00:15:15.248]  Now, they're openly stealing at levels never before seen.
[00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:15.928]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:15:15.928 --> 00:15:27.373]  Please don't forget, through the end of this month, that's how we fund our operation, plus they're great products, store-wide free shipping, 50% off all the high-quality supplements, and some of the specials are as high as 60% off.

[00:17:05.206 --> 00:17:08.248]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:08.248 --> 00:17:13.811]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:14.151 --> 00:17:17.954]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:19.215]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:19.215 --> 00:17:20.215]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:20.215 --> 00:17:26.760]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[00:19:17.049 --> 00:19:23.933]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[00:19:23.933 --> 00:19:24.493]  We made it.
[00:19:24.493 --> 00:19:26.675]  And that's really where this goes.
[00:19:26.675 --> 00:19:28.476]  God's got a big war for you ready.

[00:19:29.056 --> 00:19:35.523]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[00:19:35.523 --> 00:19:40.568]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[00:19:40.568 --> 00:19:43.431]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[00:19:43.431 --> 00:19:45.813]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[00:19:45.813 --> 00:19:49.337]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[00:19:49.337 --> 00:19:50.358]  I want to go to the next level.
[00:19:50.598 --> 00:19:54.881]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[00:19:54.881 --> 00:19:57.764]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[00:19:57.764 --> 00:19:58.845]  I want life!
[00:19:58.845 --> 00:20:02.868]  I want Jesus!
[00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:05.470]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:30.061 --> 00:20:32.161]  Lights out!
[00:20:32.161 --> 00:20:38.564]  The Globalists and their new QI-COM masters have removed President Trump.
[00:20:38.564 --> 00:20:40.964]  He was a Russian agent.
[00:20:40.964 --> 00:20:44.506]  And now, America's not gonna be great again.
[00:20:44.506 --> 00:20:46.666]  Brought to you by Hillary Clinton.
[00:20:46.666 --> 00:20:47.987]  She'll bring America to heel.
[00:20:52.182 --> 00:20:55.603]  Oh, but that's an alternate reality!
[00:20:55.603 --> 00:20:57.744]  We were all told about.
[00:20:57.744 --> 00:21:00.164]  But it didn't happen, did it?
[00:21:00.164 --> 00:21:04.766]  This is a syndicated radio show that also simulcasts via television.
[00:21:04.766 --> 00:21:10.007]  I started doing that about 18 years ago.
[00:21:10.007 --> 00:21:14.409]  I launched streaming the show so that people could actually see what I was talking about.
[00:21:14.409 --> 00:21:21.071]  Because I'd say, oh, I've got a congressional report here that says we're going to hand the entire national park system over to the UN.
[00:21:22.148 --> 00:21:23.809]  And people wouldn't believe me.
[00:21:23.809 --> 00:21:27.190]  So I started simulcasting video.
[00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.571]  And now here we are today so I can show people.
[00:21:29.571 --> 00:21:30.651]  Like this stack of news.
[00:21:30.651 --> 00:21:32.972]  Document cam shot please.
[00:21:32.972 --> 00:21:37.773]  Just go to any search engine, type in deep state coup against Trump.
[00:21:37.773 --> 00:21:39.254]  And then put in InfoWars.com.
[00:21:39.254 --> 00:21:44.035]  You'll get hundreds of articles going back to times like May 10th, 2017.
[00:21:46.397 --> 00:21:53.919]  You can actually find me on January 20th, 2017, saying that they'd try it, and exactly who was running it, because they actually funded it.
[00:21:53.919 --> 00:21:56.880]  Obama signed an executive order.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.961]  See, I had the exact blueprint.
[00:21:58.961 --> 00:22:00.781]  It wasn't that I was so smart.
[00:22:00.781 --> 00:22:11.324]  Obama put a stay-behind group, part of the CIA, part of the Justice Department, part of the Ford and Carnegie Endowment, to unseat the president.
[00:22:11.324 --> 00:22:14.505]  Brett Hume, last week, why he told Tucker Carlson that.
[00:22:15.322 --> 00:22:20.566]  He said, yes, there was a deep state national emergency declared through different bodies in the government.
[00:22:20.566 --> 00:22:22.948]  They tried to unseat the president.
[00:22:22.948 --> 00:22:27.751]  Oh, Brit Hume tells us that two years later.
[00:22:27.751 --> 00:22:30.973]  By the way, Brit Hume knew that day one.
[00:22:30.973 --> 00:22:32.514]  Back then, he was more on the fence about Trump.
[00:22:32.514 --> 00:22:33.835]  They thought Trump might be removed.
[00:22:33.835 --> 00:22:37.918]  But see, now, now they failed.
[00:22:37.918 --> 00:22:38.479]  Here it is.
[00:22:38.479 --> 00:22:41.361]  Deep state pushes coup against Trump over Comey firing.
[00:22:42.483 --> 00:22:43.744]  That was right after Comey was fired.
[00:22:43.744 --> 00:22:46.307]  I laid out exactly what happened.
[00:22:46.307 --> 00:22:48.790]  We broke it all down in the videos and articles posted there.
[00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.794]  And that's why they wanted us taken off in the summer.
[00:22:52.794 --> 00:22:57.839]  Because we were saying everything they were doing.
[00:22:57.839 --> 00:23:01.162]  And that scared the living daylights out of them.
[00:23:02.034 --> 00:23:03.675]  Get him off, get him off.
[00:23:03.675 --> 00:23:05.496]  You heard the CEO of YouTube.
[00:23:05.496 --> 00:23:08.318]  I wanted to get Alex Jones off and I got him off.
[00:23:08.318 --> 00:23:10.419]  And now I want to get all the other conservatives off.
[00:23:10.419 --> 00:23:19.886]  She just admits it on television, in front of a huge auditorium of people.
[00:23:19.886 --> 00:23:22.727]  And they're not going to stop now.
[00:23:22.727 --> 00:23:26.010]  They went and made it all up, folks.
[00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:27.951]  They had congressional hearings where they said,
[00:23:32.472 --> 00:23:36.456]  Alex Jones works for the Russians.
[00:23:36.456 --> 00:23:39.119]  And members of Congress lean down and they go, I want him off air.
[00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:45.386]  And they say, sir, we were working on it at lunch.
[00:23:45.386 --> 00:23:47.228]  You think I'm going to play the clips again?
[00:23:47.228 --> 00:23:50.211]  Imagine you're watching that going.
[00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:53.714]  I mean, I could be somebody that they found with dead bodies in my basement.
[00:23:53.714 --> 00:23:55.036]  I would get to face my accusers.
[00:23:57.034 --> 00:24:00.875]  Oh, I'm an evil talk show host that has big American flags flying behind me.
[00:24:00.875 --> 00:24:14.578]  And it's totally for free market, totally for the Second Amendment, totally for religious rights, totally for sovereignty of a flaming nationalist Americana.
[00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:16.099]  And I'm the bad guy.
[00:24:16.099 --> 00:24:19.799]  It's just, imagine the inversion of reality.
[00:24:19.799 --> 00:24:22.120]  Shame thing, saying Trump's against America?
[00:24:25.185 --> 00:24:26.665]  Yeah, Congressman Quigley.
[00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:33.907]  I mean, there's like 15 hearings you can pull up, but the worst are in the Armed Services Committee in the House.
[00:24:33.907 --> 00:24:39.128]  I mean, it's flat out scary when they've got the military civilians sitting in there.
[00:24:39.128 --> 00:24:46.669]  These are people that direct the military to overthrow governments, kill people and break things, lying about you saying you're a traitor.
[00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:48.630]  No, let me tell you something.
[00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:52.831]  All of you lying scumbags saying, I'm a traitor to this country.
[00:24:52.831 --> 00:24:53.551]  You're the traitors.
[00:24:54.798 --> 00:24:55.659]  Oh, and here's the good news.
[00:24:55.659 --> 00:24:58.481]  In fact, I want to play it next segment.
[00:24:58.481 --> 00:25:00.322]  I only played this last week once.
[00:25:00.322 --> 00:25:01.903]  I should play it ten times.
[00:25:01.903 --> 00:25:15.193]  General Dunford and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary of Defense laying out that to say that Google's taking us over is an understatement, and we're totally infiltrated by them, and it's treason.
[00:25:15.193 --> 00:25:18.396]  And Google works for the CHICOMS.
[00:25:18.396 --> 00:25:18.736]  Of course.
[00:25:21.027 --> 00:25:33.617]  The culture at Google, the culture at major universities, the culture at Evergreen, U, and Harvard, and Yale, and all these places is, America is evil.
[00:25:33.617 --> 00:25:36.038]  Communism is good.
[00:25:36.038 --> 00:25:41.342]  Half the millennials in polls say they're communist or socialist.
[00:25:41.342 --> 00:25:42.603]  We have cancer.
[00:25:42.603 --> 00:25:43.304]  Let's admit it.
[00:25:44.656 --> 00:25:57.365]  And the fact that Dunford has to sit up there and explain that he went and met with Google and met with an auditorium of their employees and said, we're the good guys, not the chi-coms.
[00:25:57.365 --> 00:26:05.050]  And it doesn't mean our military or our government's perfect, because it can be hijacked and run by people like Barack Obama.
[00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:09.933]  That's why you can't let too much power transfer into any centralized system, because it always gets abused.
[00:26:09.933 --> 00:26:12.235]  And the most centralized thing in the world
[00:26:13.055 --> 00:26:18.047]  That is the most cutthroat evil that anyone has ever imagined is the Chinese Communist.
[00:26:18.047 --> 00:26:20.071]  Bye!
[00:26:20.071 --> 00:26:21.494]  Orders of magnitude!
[00:26:24.167 --> 00:26:30.289]  And our universities are publicly bought off by their Confucius Institutes and all the rest of it.
[00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:35.871]  I've talked to high-level folks at the Pentagon, CIA, Naval Intelligence, you name it, but I can do my own research.
[00:26:35.871 --> 00:26:37.691]  Hell, I did this stuff before they were on to it.
[00:26:37.691 --> 00:26:50.155]  I'm not bragging, it's just... It's like I had Jack Mazzobicon, who's heavily dialed in, and I said, what's the order of magnitude that your colleagues that you've come up with, he used to be in China, used to live there,
[00:26:52.356 --> 00:26:57.180]  And how much bigger is the Chinese infiltration of the United States compared to Russia?
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.582]  I said 50%?
[00:26:59.582 --> 00:26:59.602]  100%?
[00:26:59.602 --> 00:26:59.902]  He goes, no, 1000%.
[00:27:06.104 --> 00:27:11.248]  Because when the Russians try to buy you off, they go, would you like to be in business with us?
[00:27:11.248 --> 00:27:12.489]  Would you like Russia?
[00:27:12.489 --> 00:27:13.409]  That's not how China does it.
[00:27:13.409 --> 00:27:17.893]  They make you give all your technology, all your codes, everything to them.
[00:27:17.893 --> 00:27:19.774]  They make you move over to China.
[00:27:19.774 --> 00:27:24.978]  They usually make you marry a Chinese woman who's got family over there they'll kill if you don't play ball.
[00:27:25.779 --> 00:27:30.400]  You ever wonder why so many tech heads who are really gay have a Chinese wife and Chinese kids?
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.701]  Because they've made the deal, folks.
[00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:36.102]  And by the way, if you don't know about that, that's the olden days.
[00:27:36.102 --> 00:27:39.843]  Back when two kingdoms would merge, they'd make their kids marry.
[00:27:39.843 --> 00:27:41.563]  Or it wasn't a real alliance.
[00:27:41.563 --> 00:27:44.304]  Like, our grandkids are gonna be the same.
[00:27:44.304 --> 00:27:47.225]  And this 200-year war is about to end.
[00:27:47.225 --> 00:27:48.945]  So I'm explaining this.
[00:27:48.945 --> 00:27:51.406]  China is absorbing us.
[00:27:53.063 --> 00:27:58.246]  We're not merging with China, we're being eaten by China.
[00:27:58.246 --> 00:28:08.272]  And now, right as the last parts of us were going into the Chinese dragon's mouth, the American eagle's trying to fly out of there.
[00:28:08.272 --> 00:28:14.115]  And it's flapping its wings and it's almost getting out of there, and the Democrats are panicking, they're like, no!
[00:28:14.115 --> 00:28:16.036]  Our whole ethos is hating America!
[00:28:16.036 --> 00:28:19.418]  Go to any Democrat event.
[00:28:20.603 --> 00:28:21.844]  I always knew they hated America.
[00:28:21.844 --> 00:28:30.972]  I knew some of them did, but I've gone to Democrat events, and they'll be like, Alex, get out of here, boo, boo, boo, when the event's called.
[00:28:30.972 --> 00:28:34.255]  Donald Trump, Alex Jones, and the Age of Fake News.
[00:28:34.255 --> 00:28:36.898]  They have a big public event, downtown Austin, block the streets.
[00:28:38.211 --> 00:28:44.457]  I show up, and they're booing me, but as soon as I said, America's back, you'll never stop it, they literally started going, AHHHHH!
[00:28:44.457 --> 00:28:45.218]  AHHHHH!
[00:28:45.218 --> 00:28:46.599]  Get it off!
[00:28:46.599 --> 00:28:50.883]  And people started running up, going, I like to have sex with kids, and licking my face and hitting me.
[00:28:50.883 --> 00:28:53.546]  And I looked into the bleachers, and the people were just flopping around like,
[00:28:59.668 --> 00:29:01.629]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:01.629 --> 00:29:06.952]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:06.952 --> 00:29:08.532]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:08.532 --> 00:29:16.876]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:16.876 --> 00:29:22.579]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:22.759 --> 00:29:24.560]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.742]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:26.742 --> 00:29:31.245]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:31.245 --> 00:29:33.426]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:29:33.426 --> 00:29:41.171]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:29:41.391 --> 00:29:47.115]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:29:47.115 --> 00:29:47.455]  It's you!

[00:30:11.602 --> 00:30:20.290]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.

[00:33:03.807 --> 00:33:06.429]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:12.958 --> 00:33:26.483]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:45.122 --> 00:33:59.047]  All right, folks, we're gonna come back in the next segment.
[00:33:59.047 --> 00:34:02.728]  I'm gonna be able to digest this and comment on it.
[00:34:02.728 --> 00:34:07.290]  But just during the break, I was back there looking at news articles, collating things with the producers.
[00:34:08.562 --> 00:34:10.863]  And they said, hey, this is broken in like the last hour.
[00:34:10.863 --> 00:34:16.425]  And I'm like, wow, that's why we got to Google my name like every 10 minutes around here.
[00:34:16.425 --> 00:34:32.632]  I've really sat back and I've talked to my lawyers and I've said, we've got to send cease and desist letters to NPR and all these channels because they all know full well that I believe Sandy Hook happened for years and that I've never sent anybody to their houses.
[00:34:32.632 --> 00:34:37.774]  And they had NPR shows the last two weeks in a row with family members and others on the show saying,
[00:34:38.783 --> 00:34:41.964]  Please stop saying it didn't happen and please stop sending people to our houses.
[00:34:41.964 --> 00:34:45.665]  And I'm like, well it really sounds horrible that I'm doing that, right?
[00:34:45.665 --> 00:34:46.165]  But I'm not.
[00:34:46.165 --> 00:34:53.268]  And so it's the media always opening the old wounds and then saying I'm doing it.
[00:34:53.268 --> 00:34:56.549]  And saying our whole career is based on Sandy Hook when it's something I barely covered.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.163]  And then, boom, in the last hour, dozens of articles have already broke.
[00:35:02.163 --> 00:35:05.445]  And my heart goes out to this fella and whatever happened.
[00:35:05.445 --> 00:35:06.606]  They're not sure it's suicide.
[00:35:06.606 --> 00:35:08.547]  They're saying it may be.
[00:35:08.547 --> 00:35:12.409]  Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman.
[00:35:12.409 --> 00:35:14.671]  They never even said Jeremy Richman's name.
[00:35:14.671 --> 00:35:16.072]  It's in the lawsuit against me.
[00:35:16.072 --> 00:35:17.253]  He was suing me.
[00:35:17.253 --> 00:35:19.374]  But there I just said his name.
[00:35:19.374 --> 00:35:23.217]  Sandy Hook dad kills himself as defamation suit continues.
[00:35:23.217 --> 00:35:24.458]  This one says that.
[00:35:24.458 --> 00:35:26.799]  Other local news says they believe that's what it is.
[00:35:26.799 --> 00:35:27.820]  And then it's a picture of me.
[00:35:29.699 --> 00:35:31.520]  So this is what happens, folks.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.722]  They make my whole identity this.
[00:35:33.722 --> 00:35:36.964]  This poor guy is dead.
[00:35:36.964 --> 00:35:38.965]  And there's an image of me.
[00:35:38.965 --> 00:35:50.073]  Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman, Sandy Hook dead, kills himself as defamation suit continues.
[00:35:50.073 --> 00:35:52.995]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[00:35:55.239 --> 00:35:57.940]  Father of Sandy Hook shooting victim found dead.
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:05.001]  Here's the news, WTFSB saying they don't know, probably a suicide.
[00:36:05.001 --> 00:36:07.662]  But, certainly should be looked into.
[00:36:07.662 --> 00:36:12.123]  Now they'll say, Jones says look into how he was found dead in front of the town hall.
[00:36:12.123 --> 00:36:17.964]  Yeah, you're supposed to look into murders, look into deaths, look into suicides.
[00:36:17.964 --> 00:36:19.785]  So, there you go.
[00:36:19.785 --> 00:36:21.185]  Heart goes out to him and his family.
[00:36:25.179 --> 00:36:34.322]  And I'll say it again, I believe Sandy Hook happened, and I've never sent people their houses, but I just, I'm just bracing to see what the media says.
[00:36:34.322 --> 00:36:38.464]  I mean, they're already putting my face up on almost all these articles.
[00:36:38.464 --> 00:36:44.786]  What is it about my show that's got the system so scared?
[00:36:44.786 --> 00:36:48.508]  I mean, I want to thank the New York Times.
[00:36:48.508 --> 00:36:51.649]  Seriously, they didn't put my face up on the front of it.
[00:36:53.317 --> 00:36:59.142]  Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman, Sandy Hook dad kills himself as decimation suit continues.
[00:36:59.142 --> 00:37:01.123]  The New Haven Register.
[00:37:01.123 --> 00:37:01.664]  Another one.
[00:37:01.664 --> 00:37:10.370]  Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman, Sandy Hook dad kills himself as decimation suit continues.
[00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:15.234]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[00:37:15.234 --> 00:37:19.037]  I have never said Jeremy Richman's name.
[00:37:19.037 --> 00:37:19.878]  In fact, most of the people
[00:37:21.084 --> 00:37:23.807]  In these suits again, I never even said their names.
[00:37:23.807 --> 00:37:28.313]  And they're like 80 page lawsuits and I read it and most of the stuff I never even said.
[00:37:28.313 --> 00:37:39.106]  And so that's why we know confidently, even if we don't get a fair jury down the road that goes to that, that it'll be overturned on appeal because it'll make new public law.
[00:37:41.337 --> 00:37:47.902]  We've talked to top lawyers like Alan Dershowitz, you name it, and they agree that this is just unheard of.
[00:37:47.902 --> 00:37:51.105]  You actually read the suits versus what I actually said.
[00:37:51.105 --> 00:37:52.366]  People ask, what is this all about?
[00:37:52.366 --> 00:37:54.107]  It's about ending the First Amendment.
[00:37:54.107 --> 00:37:56.569]  It can be said that Sandy Hook was being used to go after the Second Amendment.
[00:37:56.569 --> 00:38:01.172]  Well, it's been successful going after the First Amendment so far.
[00:38:01.172 --> 00:38:02.453]  So, really, really sad.
[00:38:04.318 --> 00:38:10.280]  I'm just bracing for corporate media to further connect me to this poor man's death.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.980]  The sad death.
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:16.241]  But this whole Sandy Hook thing has been weird from the start.
[00:38:16.241 --> 00:38:19.602]  And I believe it happened.
[00:38:19.602 --> 00:38:24.824]  And then I watch all these powerful forces that are swirling around.
[00:38:24.824 --> 00:38:29.525]  All these big law firms, the Democratic Party, and all these think tanks, universities, and groups.
[00:38:32.763 --> 00:38:38.126]  I've seen parents on the news go, we just want him to apologize before they ever sued me.
[00:38:38.126 --> 00:38:40.287]  And I said, okay, I'm not the guy that ever first said this.
[00:38:40.287 --> 00:38:42.068]  It was internet sensation.
[00:38:42.068 --> 00:38:42.568]  We covered it.
[00:38:42.568 --> 00:38:43.869]  But I said, okay, I apologize.
[00:38:43.869 --> 00:38:44.689]  I believe your kid's died.
[00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:49.312]  And I'm sorry if things I've said question things hurt you.
[00:38:49.312 --> 00:38:53.574]  And that like triggered like blood in the water just.
[00:38:53.574 --> 00:38:58.837]  And so I guess that's why they always say don't apologize, especially the left, because
[00:39:00.157 --> 00:39:04.458]  It's always turned into something different than what you did.
[00:39:04.458 --> 00:39:06.739]  And I don't blame the families.
[00:39:06.739 --> 00:39:08.039]  They've been through a lot of trauma.
[00:39:08.039 --> 00:39:12.800]  You know, it's the law firms that convinced the families to sue the dead hero teacher.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:23.943]  And it's the law firms that convinced them to sue the school district, and the police, and everybody else, on and on and on, and the guy manufacturers, and the Democratic Party.
[00:39:23.943 --> 00:39:27.564]  But Hillary came out and said that I'm the Sandy Hook guy.
[00:39:29.224 --> 00:39:31.265]  And that's when I really went, uh-uh.
[00:39:31.265 --> 00:39:34.167]  Like three years ago, I said, stop it.
[00:39:34.167 --> 00:39:35.628]  That is not what I said.
[00:39:35.628 --> 00:39:36.589]  That is not what I believe.
[00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:39.090]  That's out of context.
[00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:49.757]  Because I was just sick of her trying to enrage her supporters to use me as a political weapon against Trump to build up the straw man to then hurt Trump and the country.
[00:39:49.757 --> 00:39:58.363]  And then once Hillary ran national ads, attacked me in speeches, when Trump lost, Democrats literally believe I got Trump elected.
[00:39:59.431 --> 00:40:05.795]  We were part of it, our audience was a critical part of it, but they think I'm like Godzilla attacking Tokyo.
[00:40:05.795 --> 00:40:20.204]  They really believe that I'm the Homeland character and that I've got like a thousand employees and I run the country and I've got all the answers and I'm like this evil genius.
[00:40:20.204 --> 00:40:23.806]  And the truth is way far the opposite of that.
[00:40:23.806 --> 00:40:28.169]  We're mom and pop and we're dealing with just very standard things like
[00:40:29.229 --> 00:40:34.233]  Making sure the garbage gets carried out and make sure that we fact check stories.
[00:40:34.233 --> 00:40:39.997]  We're a very small crew of people and we absolutely make mistakes, but they're not done on purpose.
[00:40:39.997 --> 00:40:45.681]  I've never tried to go on air and lie about somebody or say something about an event because we gain from it.
[00:40:45.681 --> 00:40:48.303]  In fact, we looked at the numbers analytics.
[00:40:48.303 --> 00:40:54.608]  We lost listeners and stations entertaining that Sandy Hook could be staged.
[00:40:54.608 --> 00:40:57.771]  You don't gain stations going, hey, look at the vaccine insert.
[00:40:58.772 --> 00:40:59.773]  Says it can kill you.
[00:40:59.773 --> 00:41:01.733]  It does say that.
[00:41:01.733 --> 00:41:06.976]  But even famous Olympic athletes and people that say, hey, I took a vaccine and got real sick.
[00:41:06.976 --> 00:41:09.337]  People then death threat their kids.
[00:41:09.337 --> 00:41:12.859]  You question in this country, you get attacked.
[00:41:12.859 --> 00:41:14.840]  You get demonized.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.541]  You go play footsie with the establishment.
[00:41:17.541 --> 00:41:18.722]  You go far.
[00:41:18.722 --> 00:41:21.984]  Now we've gone far despite all that.
[00:41:21.984 --> 00:41:22.744]  But, um,
[00:41:25.427 --> 00:41:29.851]  Again, I said I'd cover it in the next segment so I could think about this, but there's really nothing to think about.
[00:41:29.851 --> 00:41:35.936]  My wife's an open book, and imagine I'm on a four-minute break.
[00:41:35.936 --> 00:41:39.759]  I'm in there talking to him about posting the Joe Rogan interview that we're going to air coming up.
[00:41:39.759 --> 00:41:41.681]  Tim Fullworks.com from last week.
[00:41:41.681 --> 00:41:44.123]  He would have been live in the studio, but his plane was late.
[00:41:44.123 --> 00:41:45.324]  It's powerful.
[00:41:45.324 --> 00:41:46.525]  And they go, hey, have you heard about this?
[00:41:46.525 --> 00:41:49.127]  This poor Sandy Hook father was found dead.
[00:41:49.127 --> 00:41:52.730]  They're not sure if it's suicide or what.
[00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:53.811]  And I'm just stepping back.
[00:41:56.758 --> 00:42:02.779]  Looking at this, shot himself in front of the town hall.
[00:42:02.779 --> 00:42:07.060]  I mean, how do I get a fair trial with stuff like this?
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:12.642]  I've never said this guy's name.
[00:42:12.642 --> 00:42:16.063]  Never said his name until now.
[00:42:16.063 --> 00:42:20.644]  And obviously first it's, we don't know he's got gunshot wounds or whatever.
[00:42:20.644 --> 00:42:22.944]  Now it's, well, apparent suicide.
[00:42:22.944 --> 00:42:25.005]  I mean, is there gonna be a police investigation?
[00:42:25.005 --> 00:42:26.205]  Are they gonna look at the surveillance cameras?
[00:42:28.424 --> 00:42:31.106]  I mean, what happened to this guy?
[00:42:31.106 --> 00:42:37.711]  This whole Sandy Hook thing is, like, really getting even crazier.
[00:42:37.711 --> 00:42:44.556]  And the way the media has been on this since day one is what made people suspicious.
[00:42:44.556 --> 00:42:49.600]  When the media blamed all Americans for what happened, people are sick of that.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.843]  Bad people are to blame for what happens with guns or cars or knives or baseball bats.
[00:42:52.843 --> 00:42:56.185]  But we should pray for the family of this poor gentleman.
[00:42:56.185 --> 00:42:58.087]  We pray for Jeremy Richman's family.
[00:42:59.281 --> 00:43:05.505]  Wars are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[00:43:05.505 --> 00:43:11.410]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:13.011]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[00:43:13.011 --> 00:43:13.531]  We stopped her.
[00:43:13.531 --> 00:43:15.713]  We got a Nationalist in.
[00:43:15.713 --> 00:43:17.914]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[00:43:17.914 --> 00:43:18.835]  We are winning.
[00:43:19.667 --> 00:43:25.172]  But those of us who are at the very front line of the tip of the spear are under unprecedented attack.
[00:43:25.172 --> 00:43:30.277]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[00:43:30.277 --> 00:43:31.378]  This is about who wants it most.
[00:43:32.839 --> 00:43:36.361]  You know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors, they've taken everything.
[00:43:36.361 --> 00:43:38.501]  I am in your hands, you are in my hands.
[00:43:38.501 --> 00:43:41.703]  I need financial support and I got products you and your family need.
[00:43:41.703 --> 00:43:42.823]  It's that simple.
[00:43:42.823 --> 00:43:50.406]  Thousands of great products, whatever's award-winning, whatever's best-selling, what folks love, what I love, we bring it to you at InforMoreShore.com.

[00:43:58.490 --> 00:43:58.790]  Thank you.
[00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:02.511]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[00:44:02.511 --> 00:44:05.452]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[00:44:05.452 --> 00:44:08.393]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[00:44:08.393 --> 00:44:12.955]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patronage supply, one of the top
[00:44:14.011 --> 00:44:23.155]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[00:44:23.155 --> 00:44:28.518]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.

[00:44:43.525 --> 00:44:45.507]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[00:44:45.507 --> 00:44:48.030]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:53.055]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[00:44:53.055 --> 00:45:00.122]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[00:45:00.122 --> 00:45:02.104]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:45:02.104 --> 00:45:02.525]  Go ahead.
[00:45:03.152 --> 00:45:05.033]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:45:05.033 --> 00:45:08.896]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:45:08.896 --> 00:45:10.317]  It just gets old, man.
[00:45:10.317 --> 00:45:12.739]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:45:12.739 --> 00:45:15.060]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:19.063]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:45:19.063 --> 00:45:21.505]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:45:22.365 --> 00:45:25.047]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:45:25.047 --> 00:45:26.408]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:45:26.408 --> 00:45:27.529]  Us being shut down?
[00:45:27.529 --> 00:45:29.010]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:30.071]  You know what, Alex?
[00:45:30.071 --> 00:45:31.192]  Put him on pause again.
[00:45:31.192 --> 00:45:32.293]  Hey, Frank!
[00:45:32.293 --> 00:45:37.958]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:45:37.958 --> 00:45:42.461]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:45:42.461 --> 00:45:45.604]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:45:45.604 --> 00:45:46.084]  You understand?
[00:45:46.084 --> 00:45:47.705]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:45:47.705 --> 00:45:48.826]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:45:49.827 --> 00:45:55.408]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[00:45:55.408 --> 00:45:56.149]  Do you understand?
[00:45:56.149 --> 00:45:57.389]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:45:57.389 --> 00:46:00.189]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[00:46:00.189 --> 00:46:03.090]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:05.091]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[00:46:05.091 --> 00:46:08.011]  And most of them are funded by the globalists.
[00:46:08.011 --> 00:46:10.772]  InfoWars is truly the tip of the spear of the Zeitgeist.
[00:46:11.323 --> 00:46:14.445]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[00:46:14.445 --> 00:46:15.987]  I didn't invent all this.
[00:46:15.987 --> 00:46:22.572]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[00:46:22.572 --> 00:46:25.354]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[00:46:26.414 --> 00:46:29.755]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[00:46:29.755 --> 00:46:32.676]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[00:46:32.676 --> 00:46:34.376]  That sends chills up my spine.
[00:46:34.376 --> 00:46:47.920]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.861]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[00:46:50.521 --> 00:46:55.784]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[00:46:55.784 --> 00:47:03.327]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[00:47:03.327 --> 00:47:09.791]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:09.791 --> 00:47:14.173]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:47:16.946 --> 00:47:22.430]  Who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:30.956]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:47:30.956 --> 00:47:42.424]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[00:47:42.424 --> 00:47:43.965]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[00:47:44.745 --> 00:48:00.696]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[00:48:00.696 --> 00:48:03.418]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[00:48:03.418 --> 00:48:09.802]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[00:48:12.495 --> 00:48:15.096]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:48:15.096 --> 00:48:26.078]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:48:26.078 --> 00:48:27.979]  Well, I gotta tell you something.
[00:48:27.979 --> 00:48:38.701]  It's being reported that the father of Sandy Hook victim, who I never said his name, who was suing me, has been found dead in front of the town hall courthouse.
[00:48:38.701 --> 00:48:40.442]  And I'm looking at article after article
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:45.782]  And you read them and it's about me.
[00:48:45.782 --> 00:48:49.846]  And it's my face.
[00:48:49.846 --> 00:48:54.190]  And so it'll now be Alex Jones killed this man.
[00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:56.212]  My questioning years ago.
[00:48:56.212 --> 00:48:59.775]  And so we've got to be taken off the air.
[00:48:59.775 --> 00:49:01.116]  That's where all this is going.
[00:49:01.116 --> 00:49:09.003]  I mean, this is this is as obvious as the day is long how the media is going to use this tragic event.
[00:49:09.003 --> 00:49:09.444]  I'll tell you.
[00:49:10.737 --> 00:49:12.418]  It's just mind-blowing.
[00:49:12.418 --> 00:49:14.379]  Absolutely mind-blowing.
[00:49:14.379 --> 00:49:24.085]  It's like being in a weird dystopic nightmare film like Lost Highway or something.
[00:49:24.085 --> 00:49:25.926]  David Lynch is gonna walk out any moment.
[00:49:25.926 --> 00:49:27.127]  Lynch has been on the show before.
[00:49:27.127 --> 00:49:30.809]  It just never ends!
[00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:53.694]  And the weirdest thing is, I'm all over the news, I'm everywhere, doing my quote-unquote apology tour for years, since Hillary said, I said nobody died at Sandy Hook, saying, I believe people died, and I never sent people to your houses, because one of the guys that actually goes up there is crazy, he's come down here, and gotten in our face, saying we're covering up, saying Sandy Hook happened.
[00:49:53.694 --> 00:49:58.655]  So I've already dealt with some of these crazies, and
[00:49:59.901 --> 00:50:08.669]  Then, though, you can't get the families and their lawyers to stop saying that I'm currently doing it.
[00:50:08.669 --> 00:50:10.230]  And then that way it's a clear and present issue.
[00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:11.932]  Like, Roku, take him off!
[00:50:11.932 --> 00:50:13.033]  He's doing it now!
[00:50:13.033 --> 00:50:17.617]  Or NPR, he won't stop!
[00:50:17.617 --> 00:50:19.498]  We just asked him to stop, but he won't.
[00:50:19.498 --> 00:50:21.280]  It's why we have to do it.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.561]  It's why we have to get rid of the First Amendment.
[00:50:27.153 --> 00:50:35.699]  I believe people died there, but undoubtedly the Democratic Party, the media, these law firms are using this to try to end the First Amendment, something Democrats openly want right now.
[00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:50.369]  I mean, a bunch of the articles say his name, Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman, Sandy Hook dad kills himself as the defamation suit continues.
[00:50:53.151 --> 00:51:02.718]  And then it just goes on, article after article, with my face on the front, and my name, with his death.
[00:51:02.718 --> 00:51:06.461]  We have no idea whether he was even murdered at this point!
[00:51:06.461 --> 00:51:08.183]  Why would some anti-gun guy do this?
[00:51:08.183 --> 00:51:10.164]  This is really sad.
[00:51:10.164 --> 00:51:16.089]  My prayers go out to him and his family, and we wish for the truth of whatever really happened here to come out.
[00:51:16.089 --> 00:51:19.171]  We don't know yet.
[00:51:19.171 --> 00:51:21.773]  And we'll see the corporate media say outrageous lies, but it's what they do.
[00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:24.811]  The good news of no collusion.
[00:51:24.811 --> 00:51:29.233]  The good news that I'm not a Russian agent comes out.
[00:51:29.233 --> 00:51:34.496]  And now, this happens right on time.
[00:51:34.496 --> 00:51:36.997]  Just, just amazing.
[00:51:36.997 --> 00:51:38.218]  And he's one of many people suing me.
[00:51:38.218 --> 00:51:39.078]  I've never said his name.
[00:51:39.078 --> 00:51:39.659]  I have now.
[00:51:39.659 --> 00:51:46.042]  And, you know, my prayers, again, for him and for his family.
[00:51:46.042 --> 00:51:49.084]  Let's go ahead and play one of the local newscasts that just came out about this.
[00:51:49.084 --> 00:51:49.404]  Here it is.
[00:51:50.822 --> 00:51:56.385]  Breaking news at noon, we are now learning that a father of one of the Sandy Hook victims has taken his own life this morning.
[00:51:56.385 --> 00:52:01.928]  Newtown police were called to a building in town to respond to reports of a suicide.
[00:52:01.928 --> 00:52:06.471]  We now know that Jeremy Richmond, the father of Aviel Richmond, was found dead.
[00:52:06.471 --> 00:52:09.413]  He had started a foundation in his daughter's name.
[00:52:09.413 --> 00:52:13.715]  Channel 3's Nicole Nalepa has been following this heart-wrenching story closely.
[00:52:13.715 --> 00:52:16.657]  Nicole, where does the investigation stand right now?
[00:52:17.177 --> 00:52:18.197]  Cara, you said it.
[00:52:18.197 --> 00:52:22.579]  It is a heart-wrenching story and heartbreaking for a community that has been hit with so much.
[00:52:22.579 --> 00:52:28.821]  Newtown police say Richmond's death appears to be a suicide, and that his death does not appear to be suspicious.
[00:52:28.821 --> 00:52:30.302]  And that is all that they're saying right now.
[00:52:30.302 --> 00:52:33.583]  I'm hearing an autopsy is expected to be done later today.
[00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:36.144]  So here's what we were able to find out for you on this story.
[00:52:36.144 --> 00:52:41.126]  Newtown police, ambulance, and fire were called to Edmonton Town Hall at 7 a.m.
[00:52:41.126 --> 00:52:43.267]  to investigate the report of a suicide.
[00:52:43.727 --> 00:52:50.111]  And just to be clear, Edmond Town Hall is a theater and event space in town that houses many community events.
[00:52:50.111 --> 00:52:53.274]  That's where they found the body of 49-year-old Jeremy Richman.
[00:52:53.274 --> 00:53:00.038]  He was the father of Avielle Richman, one of the first grade students killed in the 2012 tragedy at Sandy Hook School.
[00:53:00.038 --> 00:53:10.145]  And he created the Avielle Foundation in his daughter's memory, which was a non-profit organization focused on preventing violence through brain research and community engagement.
[00:53:10.145 --> 00:53:12.947]  Police say Richman had an office at Edmond Town Hall.
[00:53:13.507 --> 00:53:22.849]  Now, this news comes after two survivors of the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, committed suicide in the past week.
[00:53:22.849 --> 00:53:30.371]  The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is open 24 hours a day, so if you or someone you know needs help, please call this number.
[00:53:30.371 --> 00:53:30.831]  1-800-273-8255.
[00:53:30.831 --> 00:53:33.192]  Live in the studio, Nicole Malepa, Channel 3 Eyewitness News.
[00:53:39.253 --> 00:53:40.734]  And so they're saying it looks like a suicide.
[00:53:40.734 --> 00:53:43.836]  Other media says they don't know, but let's just say it is.
[00:53:43.836 --> 00:53:44.837]  Let's just believe mainstream media.
[00:53:44.837 --> 00:53:46.138]  We're not supposed to ever question them.
[00:53:46.138 --> 00:53:47.379]  Fine.
[00:53:47.379 --> 00:53:49.680]  We have 22 service members spending suicide a day.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.301]  It's an epidemic.
[00:53:50.301 --> 00:53:51.462]  I've got articles here.
[00:53:51.462 --> 00:53:52.763]  It's not just you.
[00:53:52.763 --> 00:53:57.786]  New data shows more than half of young people in America don't have a romantic partner.
[00:53:57.786 --> 00:54:00.128]  They have their iPhone.
[00:54:00.128 --> 00:54:02.810]  So people are very depressed.
[00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:04.151]  The iPhones are making us depressed.
[00:54:04.151 --> 00:54:04.971]  The screen time is.
[00:54:07.697 --> 00:54:08.398]  It's very sad.
[00:54:08.398 --> 00:54:09.899]  I know this.
[00:54:09.899 --> 00:54:17.824]  It's the corporate media that says it is the worst thing on earth to question any mass event.
[00:54:17.824 --> 00:54:31.214]  And then they say that I'm questioning Sandy Hook like a parrot when I'm not, and then using my name to bring out the hurtful stories over and over and over again to hype up school shootings, which causes copycats to do it more.
[00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:38.348]  And so we don't know why he took his life or if he took his life.
[00:54:38.348 --> 00:54:41.330]  I mean, the police say that's what it's leaning towards.
[00:54:41.330 --> 00:54:51.601]  Regardless, this is very, very tragic and also very, very bizarre, obviously, and very, very sad.
[00:54:51.601 --> 00:54:56.305]  But I've told the lawyers this 50 times and I'm just going to do it.
[00:54:56.305 --> 00:54:57.106]  I'm sending letters.
[00:54:58.257 --> 00:54:59.178]  I'm going to hire a service.
[00:54:59.178 --> 00:55:04.462]  I'm going to send cease and desist letters to probably a thousand media outlets, and I'm going to send it to all the lawyers.
[00:55:04.462 --> 00:55:06.444]  I've told their lawyers face-to-face, too.
[00:55:06.444 --> 00:55:13.550]  You know full well, it's been years and years since I said that it's legitimate for people to question and maybe, you know, this was staged.
[00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:15.492]  Because of past events that have been staged.
[00:55:15.492 --> 00:55:20.736]  And they do stuff like clip out where I even repeat what I said before out of context and say, look, he's doing it again.
[00:55:21.477 --> 00:55:22.578]  It's crazy.
[00:55:22.578 --> 00:55:23.699]  And it's gotta stop.
[00:55:23.699 --> 00:55:34.329]  Because if you're claiming I'm the devil for saying this stuff didn't happen and then opening wounds out of context years ago and then you keep doing it, it's bad!
[00:55:34.329 --> 00:55:35.370]  And it's outrageous!
[00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:37.012]  And stop doing it in my name!
[00:55:39.181 --> 00:55:42.164]  Regardless, folks, they're trying to shut us down, and you know that.
[00:55:42.164 --> 00:55:45.007]  And who knows how long InfoWars can hold on with stuff like this going on.
[00:55:45.007 --> 00:55:46.969]  I mean, this is just next level.
[00:55:46.969 --> 00:55:49.651]  But regardless, please pray for us and buy the products.
[00:55:49.651 --> 00:55:51.133]  Go get an InfoWars t-shirt.

[00:59:53.302 --> 00:59:55.923]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:14.785 --> 01:00:24.631]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.631 --> 01:00:28.113]  Alright folks, we've got the big exclusive Joe Rogan interview coming up.
[01:00:30.077 --> 01:00:31.517]  I've also got some commentary about Joe.
[01:00:31.517 --> 01:00:36.859]  I got really mad at him a few months ago, but then had some private talks with him and understand where he's coming from now.
[01:00:36.859 --> 01:00:49.683]  I have been completely poleaxed to hear that one of the Sandy Hook parents, who I'd never said his name, who's shooing me,
[01:00:52.847 --> 01:00:57.529]  And I guess gun manufacturers, too, and a bunch of other people committed suicide, they think.
[01:00:57.529 --> 01:00:59.650]  They're not sure.
[01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:01.431]  At the community, they said community hall.
[01:01:01.431 --> 01:01:07.314]  That sounded to me like the city hall, but it's like a community center.
[01:01:07.314 --> 01:01:11.156]  And then you turn the internet on.
[01:01:11.156 --> 01:01:19.100]  It doesn't matter what newspaper it is, Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman, Sandy Hook Dad Kills Himself As Defamation Suit Continues.
[01:01:20.481 --> 01:01:22.442]  So they haven't even read a note yet.
[01:01:22.442 --> 01:01:25.465]  It's just put my face up there.
[01:01:25.465 --> 01:01:27.786]  Immediately.
[01:01:27.786 --> 01:01:32.670]  The corporate media is just incredible.
[01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:33.571]  Just incredible.
[01:01:33.571 --> 01:01:36.172]  Well, let me just say this right now.
[01:01:36.172 --> 01:01:37.674]  I will never commit suicide.
[01:01:37.674 --> 01:01:45.379]  And no matter what the corporate media does or how they spin tragic events against me, I'm never backing down.
[01:01:45.379 --> 01:01:46.020]  I'm never giving up.
[01:01:49.958 --> 01:02:04.842]  Since all this demonization and attack has gone on, on the streets of this country, 99% of the interaction I get is positive.
[01:02:04.842 --> 01:02:08.564]  The 1% is extremely negative and hateful and also lies.
[01:02:08.564 --> 01:02:11.284]  They'll start a fight with you and then say you did it to them.
[01:02:11.284 --> 01:02:12.925]  They're all a bunch of Jussie Smolletts.
[01:02:12.925 --> 01:02:13.765]  They act the same.
[01:02:13.765 --> 01:02:16.746]  It's a very deceptive culture that the left's involved in.
[01:02:19.022 --> 01:02:22.904]  That's what they do, they deceive.
[01:02:22.904 --> 01:02:27.286]  And that's their talent.
[01:02:27.286 --> 01:02:33.128]  But I just wonder how much more Twilight Zone this is going to get.
[01:02:33.128 --> 01:02:41.312]  Because it's not like I'm saying, I'm walking in the hall and they go, did you hear about the Sandy Hook dad committing suicide?
[01:02:41.312 --> 01:02:42.992]  And I said, no.
[01:02:42.992 --> 01:02:46.634]  And I knew as they, as I walked in to look at the computer screen, it'd be my face.
[01:02:48.015 --> 01:02:50.456]  Now, I thought I'd be like a paragraph down or something.
[01:02:50.456 --> 01:02:51.877]  No, no, no.
[01:02:51.877 --> 01:02:56.179]  I'm at the top of almost all the articles.
[01:02:56.179 --> 01:03:01.121]  Good Lord.
[01:03:01.121 --> 01:03:04.863]  You know, when some veteran kills themselves, do they show Obama because he sent him to Afghanistan?
[01:03:04.863 --> 01:03:07.264]  Do they show Bush because he sent him to Iraq?
[01:03:07.264 --> 01:03:09.446]  No.
[01:03:09.446 --> 01:03:13.027]  You can actually show some cause, you know, those illegal wars.
[01:03:13.027 --> 01:03:14.288]  But with me, they just show me
[01:03:17.401 --> 01:03:19.702]  Because that's all the media's got.
[01:03:19.702 --> 01:03:26.624]  And that's what they're going to push forever.
[01:03:26.624 --> 01:03:33.426]  I'm not going to talk about this anymore until there's new developments in it, but I'm sorry for his family and hope some prayers go out to them.
[01:03:33.426 --> 01:03:35.787]  Jeremy Richman.
[01:03:35.787 --> 01:03:38.648]  But big public speaker, had a foundation raising money.
[01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:44.296]  Deal with mentally ill people, which makes sense with the whole Adam Lanza situation.
[01:03:44.296 --> 01:03:47.559]  So, sounds like a good guy who said that's going on.
[01:03:47.559 --> 01:03:52.165]  I was actually looking forward, you know, if things progressed, I was looking forward to things progressing.
[01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:54.208]  But if they did, to actually look at these people in the eyes.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:06.129]  And, you know, presenting the dozens of times I put out videos saying I believe your children died and I'm sorry of the fact that we had to question official events, you know, it hurts your feelings.
[01:04:06.129 --> 01:04:11.234]  But, you know, I'm not saying that currently and I never really said it the way you're saying I did.
[01:04:11.234 --> 01:04:16.918]  But I understand that was your lawyers told you that you would never knowingly know that
[01:04:18.911 --> 01:04:19.231]  I haven't
[01:04:42.659 --> 01:04:47.563]  Those statements on tape with the dates and written letters to all the parents.
[01:04:47.563 --> 01:04:50.945]  So that people can't misrepresent what I've said and keep hurting them.
[01:04:50.945 --> 01:04:53.968]  It's really mean what the lawyers and the media are doing to these parents.
[01:04:53.968 --> 01:04:56.109]  These parents are really, really good people.
[01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:56.870]  Let's pray for them.
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:00.961]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[01:05:00.961 --> 01:05:07.303]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.

[01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:22.219]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:22.219 --> 01:06:23.981]  We now take you live.
[01:06:25.836 --> 01:06:31.001]  From the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:31.001 --> 01:06:32.562]  And we did reboot Americana.
[01:06:32.562 --> 01:06:49.817]  The audience, the InfoWars crew, all of us, working together, all over the world, Americana spreading, 1776, the Renaissance, free market, rediscovering family, rediscovering men being men, women being women, rediscovering strength, competition, rugged individualism,
[01:06:51.354 --> 01:06:54.555]  It's now happening and it's beautiful.
[01:06:54.555 --> 01:07:00.677]  And so those of us that are symbols of that awakening, we can't be seen as symbols of victory for others.
[01:07:00.677 --> 01:07:14.722]  We've got to be lied about and demonized and destroyed in the court of public opinion and then sued into oblivion so that nobody else ever dare stick their head up.
[01:07:14.722 --> 01:07:16.003]  But a funny thing happened.
[01:07:18.143 --> 01:07:23.789]  All that intimidation, all that censorship, all those lies have backfired.
[01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:27.753]  And now the globalists are going to escalate their attacks.
[01:07:27.753 --> 01:07:32.138]  Because they know that nothing they're doing is working.
[01:07:32.138 --> 01:07:37.864]  So we've entered the season of the Jesse Smollett event.
[01:07:37.864 --> 01:07:38.805]  And as I told you,
[01:07:40.504 --> 01:07:55.573]  A month ago, there are federal investigations of Obama being involved with the head prosecutor that told police to back off Smollett and connections to Obama running Smollett.
[01:07:55.573 --> 01:08:01.477]  And that was in the New York Post and the Chicago Tribune on Friday night.
[01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:02.518]  I missed it till Sunday.
[01:08:02.518 --> 01:08:05.179]  I saw it, but maybe you guys can type that in.
[01:08:05.179 --> 01:08:07.281]  Just into a search engine, click news, the headline was
[01:08:08.846 --> 01:08:13.868]  Chicago police call for federal probe into Smollett.
[01:08:13.868 --> 01:08:14.949]  There it is.
[01:08:14.949 --> 01:08:20.091]  Cops call for federal probe related to Obama aide involvement in Jussie Smollett case.
[01:08:20.091 --> 01:08:25.773]  Now, type in your search engine.
[01:08:25.773 --> 01:08:32.236]  Feds probing accomplices who they believe helped Smollett.
[01:08:32.236 --> 01:08:34.437]  You'll get a couple articles and videos with me.
[01:08:35.458 --> 01:08:39.180]  Telling you our sources told us that that is indeed happening.
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:40.461]  And who did I say they were looking at?
[01:08:40.461 --> 01:08:46.204]  Who did I say they were looking at?
[01:08:46.204 --> 01:08:50.906]  The people directing the show, who stood to make tens of millions of dollars if the show didn't get unpopular.
[01:08:50.906 --> 01:09:00.271]  It was starting to get unpopular, starting to lose momentum, a lot of momentum, lost half its ratings in the last two years?
[01:09:00.271 --> 01:09:02.252]  And Obama!
[01:09:03.015 --> 01:09:04.455]  Who did I say specifically?
[01:09:04.455 --> 01:09:07.697]  Because we have the sources.
[01:09:07.697 --> 01:09:09.857]  There you go.
[01:09:09.857 --> 01:09:14.639]  And again, you can go back to the article from weeks ago.
[01:09:14.639 --> 01:09:16.500]  In fact, it's in my yesterday stack.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.040]  I never got to it.
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:21.001]  Pull that one for me, because I want to show the one from weeks ago.
[01:09:21.001 --> 01:09:25.182]  There's two of them from InfoWars.com.
[01:09:25.182 --> 01:09:32.305]  And the headline is, Feds Probing Accomplices
[01:09:34.119 --> 01:09:36.100]  More accomplices of Jesse Smollett.
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:38.261]  Or others who may have helped Smollett.
[01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:47.306]  And then I list Obamas, and I say high-level people controlling the show, who have the motive to make tens of millions.
[01:09:47.306 --> 01:09:52.168]  So when you hear, it's not just cause of race war, that's part of it, but it really is about money.
[01:09:52.168 --> 01:09:56.090]  Smollett was going to make a lot more money, not just a million whatever it was a year.
[01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:57.491]  Million one?
[01:09:57.491 --> 01:09:59.512]  If the show got higher ratings, he'd get more money.
[01:09:59.512 --> 01:10:01.313]  So, it's true, he was doing it for money.
[01:10:03.339 --> 01:10:09.425]  Who's the cherry on top that created all this racial division?
[01:10:09.425 --> 01:10:15.410]  But I want to get more into Mueller probe because this was all an illegal thing kicked off by Hillary and Obama again.
[01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:17.092]  We told you that first.
[01:10:17.092 --> 01:10:20.635]  And now, and now it's out in the open.
[01:10:20.635 --> 01:10:21.676]  So what are they going to do?
[01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:23.378]  Here is a report.
[01:10:23.378 --> 01:10:25.360]  Mueller report reveals treasonous dims.
[01:10:27.901 --> 01:10:29.842]  There was no collusion with Russia.
[01:10:29.842 --> 01:10:35.865]  There was no obstruction and none whatsoever.
[01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:41.187]  And it was a complete and total exoneration.
[01:10:41.187 --> 01:10:46.730]  It's a shame that our country had to go through this.
[01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:54.033]  To be honest, it's a shame that your president has had to go through this before I even got elected.
[01:10:54.033 --> 01:10:55.114]  It began.
[01:10:56.244 --> 01:10:58.286]  And it began illegally.
[01:10:58.286 --> 01:11:01.349]  And hopefully somebody's going to look at the other side.
[01:11:01.349 --> 01:11:14.100]  Once again, in this document that the Attorney General has just submitted to Congress, concluding after all of this investigation, nearly two year investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller and his team, no collusion.
[01:11:14.921 --> 01:11:16.162]  Bottom line, no collusion.
[01:11:16.162 --> 01:11:37.951]  40 FBI agents, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 witnesses, 500 search warrants, 230 communications records, 50 wiretaps, 13 foreign government intelligence requests, and after 675 days, there is no collusion and insufficient evidence of obstruction.
[01:11:37.951 --> 01:11:41.353]  However, in broad daylight, the mainstream media
[01:11:41.613 --> 01:11:51.818]  And the Democratic Party colluded in an effort to impeach the duly elected president of the United States of America with fabricated evidence.
[01:11:51.818 --> 01:11:52.939]  We're at a turning point here.
[01:11:52.939 --> 01:11:56.120]  The beginning of the end for the Trump presidency.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.741]  The beginning of the end.
[01:11:57.741 --> 01:11:58.681]  And breaking news!
[01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:00.042]  We have another bombshell!
[01:12:00.042 --> 01:12:03.043]  Mike Pence might have to assume the office of the presidency.
[01:12:03.043 --> 01:12:04.644]  The call for impeachment.
[01:12:04.644 --> 01:12:06.305]  Rumblings of the word impeachment.
[01:12:06.465 --> 01:12:07.406]  Breaking news!
[01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:09.107]  Another bombshell out of the White House.
[01:12:09.107 --> 01:12:10.608]  I believe this is the beginning of the end.
[01:12:10.608 --> 01:12:11.229]  I do too.
[01:12:11.229 --> 01:12:12.890]  It's really the beginning of the end.
[01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:13.931]  The beginning of the end.
[01:12:13.931 --> 01:12:15.212]  This is a tipping point.
[01:12:15.212 --> 01:12:16.113]  Trump's going down.
[01:12:16.113 --> 01:12:18.435]  This president could be impeached.
[01:12:18.435 --> 01:12:21.357]  I do not think the president will serve out his term.
[01:12:21.357 --> 01:12:23.379]  This is treason.
[01:12:23.379 --> 01:12:27.903]  And it was committed in living color across the television screens of America.
[01:12:28.123 --> 01:12:36.853]  Yet the Democrats and their deep state operatives within the mainstream media are going all in with their manufactured delusion.
[01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:43.520]  Simply because the special counsel could not connect the dots does not mean that the dots don't matter and the dots aren't troubling.
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:49.164]  He's saying no collusion, no collusion, no collusion over and over again for a long time now.
[01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:55.328]  And he's going to try and conclude that this report is proving that there's no collusion.
[01:12:55.328 --> 01:13:01.993]  And you have a lot of his sycophants who will, you know, take the nod from him and they'll say the same thing.
[01:13:01.993 --> 01:13:05.135]  But we cannot allow them to get away with this.
[01:13:05.135 --> 01:13:07.256]  He does this all the time.
[01:13:07.256 --> 01:13:09.738]  This is not the end of anything.
[01:13:09.838 --> 01:13:12.278]  I think he's going to continue to say, look, I told you the truth.
[01:13:12.278 --> 01:13:13.179]  I said it was a hoax.
[01:13:13.179 --> 01:13:15.119]  I said there was no collusion.
[01:13:15.119 --> 01:13:18.300]  And the media and the Democrats essentially lied to you.
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:21.600]  That's going to be a core message, I think, for them moving forward.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:34.143]  And it's going to be part of their campaign because you've had these Democrats, Adam Schiff and Blumenthal and all the rest of the ones that have been involved, you know, running from green room to green room saying we have direct evidence of collusion.
[01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:35.203]  That was totally blown up.
[01:13:35.843 --> 01:13:38.987]  We're not exonerating the President after 22 months for the Attorney General
[01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:56.314]  Reviewing that record in 22 hours is a bit much.
[01:13:56.314 --> 01:14:02.219]  I would, in fact, wonder if the Attorney General pressured the Special Counsel into not making that finding.
[01:14:02.219 --> 01:14:12.228]  The determination was made without regard to and is not based on the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president.
[01:14:12.228 --> 01:14:13.569]  That's very significant, Jeffrey.
[01:14:14.049 --> 01:14:14.870]  That is.
[01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:22.137]  But again, it's important to point out that that determination was not made by Mueller.
[01:14:22.137 --> 01:14:29.143]  It was made by the President's subordinates, the Attorney General Barr and Rod Rosenstein.
[01:14:29.143 --> 01:14:33.447]  Never a person that thought Bill Barr was somebody to be listened to and respected.
[01:14:33.447 --> 01:14:38.912]  Bill Barr was appointed by Donald Trump after he decided that Jeff Sessions wasn't his Roy Cohn.
[01:14:38.912 --> 01:14:39.532]  He wasn't his
[01:14:40.353 --> 01:14:40.674]  I don't
[01:15:00.635 --> 01:15:27.488]  I was told by really smart, high-level sources that as soon as the Mueller report came out, Trump will drop the hammer on censorship, which he's now doing against the universities and their anti-free speech activity and more, is set to come.
[01:15:27.488 --> 01:15:28.309]  But make no mistake,
[01:15:29.961 --> 01:15:33.222]  It was Obama.
[01:15:33.222 --> 01:15:36.243]  It was Hillary and others that set up this fake criminal investigation.
[01:15:36.243 --> 01:15:37.924]  That's the crime.
[01:15:37.924 --> 01:15:45.766]  And now the Democrats, because they failed in their crime and could be brought to justice any time for being involved in it, are trying to double down.
[01:15:45.766 --> 01:15:47.367]  They are crazy.
[01:15:47.367 --> 01:15:49.707]  Oh, more hammers dropping!
[01:15:49.707 --> 01:15:52.648]  Michael Avenatti is charged with trying to extort Nike.
[01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:53.949]  Bloomberg, it just broke.
[01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:54.569]  More, straight ahead.
[01:15:57.559 --> 01:15:59.900]  Ew, get the stinky dog away from me.
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:01.400]  Bad breath and bad gas.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.680]  PDE stopped eating.
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:03.921]  All his hair fell out.
[01:16:03.921 --> 01:16:06.101]  Itching, licking, missing fur.
[01:16:06.101 --> 01:16:07.982]  At least $5,000 in fat bills.
[01:16:07.982 --> 01:16:10.362]  Creams, antibiotics, sprays.
[01:16:10.362 --> 01:16:11.302]  No results.
[01:16:11.302 --> 01:16:13.803]  Everything we tried failed except the Dynavite.

[01:16:16.704 --> 01:16:18.524]  If you want the dog to be healthy, you gotta feed it something.
[01:16:18.524 --> 01:16:19.084]  Hungry, healthy.
[01:16:19.084 --> 01:16:20.865]  The omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:16:20.865 --> 01:16:26.846]  Flaxseed, zinc, alfalfa, the digestive enzymes that are cooked out of regular dog food.
[01:16:26.846 --> 01:16:29.007]  Dynavite is nutrition.
[01:16:29.007 --> 01:16:30.807]  The shedding is stopped and the itching is stopped.
[01:16:30.807 --> 01:16:36.429]  Her coat is not soft, it's silky, it's healthy and shiny and glossy.
[01:16:36.429 --> 01:16:37.990]  She's got life, she's got energy.
[01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:39.990]  Tons of energy, no more bad smell.
[01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:41.350]  Dynavite's the bomb.
[01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:46.312]  Dynavite is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs, you know, besides me, of course.
[01:16:46.732 --> 01:16:46.792]  859-428-1000.
[01:16:46.792 --> 01:16:46.852]  859-428-1000.

[01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:16.390]  After building a seven-figure business from his couch, God called him to ministry to teach prosperity based on pain he could not tolerate in others' lives.
[01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:19.052]  IRS, creditors, car loans, debt.

[01:20:01.332 --> 01:20:10.117]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:10.117 --> 01:20:15.320]  From Nazareth he came with
[01:20:30.153 --> 01:20:36.394]  The devil's got a lot of tricks up his sleeve in that bag.
[01:20:36.394 --> 01:20:40.835]  God's got a couple tricks of his own.
[01:20:40.835 --> 01:20:44.876]  And things never seem to work out the way evil wants them to in the end.
[01:20:44.876 --> 01:20:52.578]  But you've got to be willing to put your butt and your blood and your guts and your family and your name on the line.
[01:20:52.578 --> 01:20:58.259]  You've got to be ready to be demonized and attacked and lied about by the globalists.
[01:20:58.259 --> 01:20:59.019]  That's the cost.
[01:20:59.873 --> 01:21:02.214]  Standing against these people.
[01:21:02.214 --> 01:21:07.817]  Well, he was the big star, just like Malazzi Ford.
[01:21:07.817 --> 01:21:17.643]  Just like all these other people they've had come out and bear false witness and make up all these lies.
[01:21:17.643 --> 01:21:24.227]  Michael Avenatti is charged with trying to extort Nike Bloomberg Reports.
[01:21:24.227 --> 01:21:28.169]  California lawyer was charged by federal prosecutors in New York.
[01:21:29.107 --> 01:21:33.370]  With attempting to extort millions of dollars out of Nike Inc.
[01:21:33.370 --> 01:21:42.717]  by threatening to release damning information about the company, which did not meet his demands, Bloomberg News reports.
[01:21:42.717 --> 01:21:45.219]  I'll call you right back.
[01:21:45.219 --> 01:21:46.600]  Got a lot of stuff going on here behind the scenes.
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:51.604]  Folks, I don't want to answer phones when I'm on air, but I had to.
[01:21:51.604 --> 01:21:53.766]  Continuing here.
[01:21:53.766 --> 01:21:56.728]  The Dems don't know what to do now.
[01:21:58.328 --> 01:22:11.839]  They are in full panic mode as their house of cards begins to accelerate downward.
[01:22:11.839 --> 01:22:21.087]  But when we come back in the next segment, I want to get into the rest of the story and what undoubtedly Trump needs to do
[01:22:22.731 --> 01:22:25.592]  Now that the Russiagate hoax is behind him.
[01:22:25.592 --> 01:22:30.053]  Because truly, it was a cloud hanging over things, it was a distraction, it was a diversion.
[01:22:30.053 --> 01:22:49.137]  There's the head of the largest, most powerful country in the world, financially, being completely and totally destabilized by the lie that our president is some type of Russian agent that the people didn't really elect him.
[01:22:49.137 --> 01:22:50.958]  But if you go back to the front page of Dred's report,
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:53.001]  There it is.
[01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:54.802]  Trump wins.
[01:22:54.802 --> 01:22:56.243]  No collusion.
[01:22:56.243 --> 01:22:57.764]  No obstruction.
[01:22:57.764 --> 01:22:59.305]  No proof of crimes.
[01:22:59.305 --> 01:23:01.466]  But Nadler says it's not over.
[01:23:01.466 --> 01:23:04.968]  They never cared about what Mueller had to say.
[01:23:04.968 --> 01:23:07.309]  Maxine's had a meltdown.
[01:23:07.309 --> 01:23:11.192]  You go to InfoWars.com.
[01:23:11.192 --> 01:23:13.353]  We have the rest of the story.
[01:23:16.533 --> 01:23:39.774]  And that's what we already told everybody, but now that's been confirmed by major think tanks and data collection groups and professors who've done the studies that Google openly stole the 2018 election and handed Democrats almost every victory they had by simply not even allowing people in many cases to know who was on the ballot.
[01:23:41.525 --> 01:23:44.668]  Many congressional districts, it would just show Democrats' names.
[01:23:44.668 --> 01:23:49.353]  Or it would say that Republicans' affiliation was the Nazi Party.
[01:23:49.353 --> 01:23:52.397]  They would not let you search certain names of certain candidates.
[01:23:52.397 --> 01:23:53.818]  They just wouldn't show up, period.
[01:23:53.818 --> 01:23:57.322]  In fact, I shot video of this last week, never got it on air, I was too busy.
[01:23:59.861 --> 01:24:04.222]  And I did it again this morning at home on two phones and a desktop and here.
[01:24:04.222 --> 01:24:05.523]  I'm gonna do it later this afternoon.
[01:24:05.523 --> 01:24:12.625]  I think when Will Johnson's on, I'm gonna come back on during the last segment he's hosting in the fourth hour and I'm gonna show you this.
[01:24:12.625 --> 01:24:24.769]  But if you go to YouTube and you type in Alex Jones and you do the filter search for today, it shows a bunch of anti-Alex Jones stuff from a year ago.
[01:24:24.769 --> 01:24:26.950]  You click last hour, same thing, you click
[01:24:28.607 --> 01:24:32.528]  This last week, this last month, this last year, it's all the same.
[01:24:32.528 --> 01:24:39.410]  Now before people could get around the censors, they could go there and find new stuff being posted by searching last hour, last day.
[01:24:39.410 --> 01:24:45.472]  In fact, they're just showing you right now.
[01:24:45.472 --> 01:24:49.273]  You click today, go ahead and click it, and it's showing you stuff from a year ago.
[01:24:49.273 --> 01:24:51.433]  All the hit pieces, Sandy Hook.
[01:24:51.433 --> 01:24:56.035]  Now click this week.
[01:24:56.035 --> 01:24:56.795]  And you click this week.
[01:24:57.902 --> 01:24:59.303]  Oh look, this week.
[01:24:59.303 --> 01:25:02.005]  That's not this week.
[01:25:02.005 --> 01:25:06.449]  Then you click this month.
[01:25:06.449 --> 01:25:07.970]  I'll just go shoot it myself an error later.
[01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:08.590]  That's what I thought.
[01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:09.691]  It's no big deal.
[01:25:09.691 --> 01:25:11.833]  Can't do it.
[01:25:11.833 --> 01:25:13.854]  Can we just go back to the filter guys?
[01:25:13.854 --> 01:25:16.376]  Just please, please, please.
[01:25:16.376 --> 01:25:17.397]  Sugar on top.
[01:25:17.397 --> 01:25:18.158]  Okay.
[01:25:18.158 --> 01:25:18.678]  Yep.
[01:25:18.678 --> 01:25:22.801]  So let's just start over because I need to get the clip.
[01:25:22.801 --> 01:25:23.802]  Click last hour, please.
[01:25:27.005 --> 01:25:28.485]  Okay, same results.
[01:25:28.485 --> 01:25:31.566]  Now go back to the filter, please.
[01:25:31.566 --> 01:25:35.447]  Click today.
[01:25:35.447 --> 01:25:36.427]  Same results.
[01:25:36.427 --> 01:25:37.208]  Now go back, please.
[01:25:37.208 --> 01:25:40.028]  Click this week.
[01:25:40.028 --> 01:25:42.749]  Same results.
[01:25:42.749 --> 01:25:45.970]  Now click this month.
[01:25:45.970 --> 01:25:48.090]  Same results.
[01:25:48.090 --> 01:25:52.851]  Now click this year.
[01:25:52.851 --> 01:25:55.192]  Now, if you go to Beto or Rourke,
[01:25:56.741 --> 01:26:00.884]  And you click last hour, it's the last hour.
[01:26:00.884 --> 01:26:14.673]  You go to the last week, it's the last week.
[01:26:14.673 --> 01:26:16.434]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:16.434 --> 01:26:22.798]  There were probably a hundred videos every couple minutes being uploaded with me in them.
[01:26:24.651 --> 01:26:30.336]  And so, Google has completely shadow-banned, in front of the entire universe, my name.
[01:26:30.336 --> 01:26:32.057]  Oh, and the President?
[01:26:32.057 --> 01:26:34.399]  Oh, and Michael Savage?
[01:26:34.399 --> 01:26:36.941]  We went through, last week, for about an hour, here.
[01:26:36.941 --> 01:26:38.682]  We shot video of it.
[01:26:38.682 --> 01:26:43.106]  Never got around to the report, because Joe Rogan was in town, and a bunch of stuff was happening.
[01:26:43.106 --> 01:26:47.289]  And, we would search prominent Democrats, and their searches worked.
[01:26:47.289 --> 01:26:51.353]  And then we searched prominent Nationalists, Conservatives, Christians, and you can't get them!
[01:26:54.190 --> 01:26:55.351]  Wow!
[01:26:55.351 --> 01:26:57.311]  So, Google doesn't fix any results.
[01:26:57.311 --> 01:26:58.512]  No, no, no.
[01:26:58.512 --> 01:27:07.276]  You just literally make it to where no one can search and find people's names.
[01:27:07.276 --> 01:27:13.398]  You know, used to you'd have like 20 videos of me and then one of the top TV host in England named Alex Jones.
[01:27:13.398 --> 01:27:14.879]  She's a lovely Welsh girl.
[01:27:15.742 --> 01:27:19.543]  I was on her show once, we made the joke that if we married, she wouldn't change her name.
[01:27:19.543 --> 01:27:23.183]  We'd both be named Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Jones.
[01:27:23.183 --> 01:27:25.184]  She's Alexandra, I'm Alex, but we go by Alex.
[01:27:25.184 --> 01:27:28.664]  Wouldn't have to change any names there.
[01:27:28.664 --> 01:27:31.765]  That poor dear, you can't find her anymore.
[01:27:31.765 --> 01:27:33.945]  She's, bye-bye.
[01:27:33.945 --> 01:27:40.566]  Only the approved hit pieces are all just stacked up, and then on my name, they all get revenue and money.
[01:27:40.566 --> 01:27:43.367]  So there's another element of fraud.
[01:27:43.367 --> 01:27:44.367]  See, that's slavery.
[01:27:45.472 --> 01:27:58.760]  They use edited tapes of me and everything to make money, and then everybody else is feverishly trying to upload Alex Jones videos, but no one can see them, except you can promote them on Reddit and Twitter and everywhere else, and then use it as a hosting platform.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:07.145]  They haven't figured out a way to try to block that out yet, but they're sending everyone to the Phantom Zone.
[01:28:07.145 --> 01:28:07.966]  Oh, Beto O'Rourke!
[01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:11.158]  He's up to the hour.
[01:28:11.158 --> 01:28:14.199]  He's up to the day, up to the week, up to the month of the year.
[01:28:14.199 --> 01:28:16.139]  It's all an accurate search.
[01:28:16.139 --> 01:28:17.360]  But not Alex Jones.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.460]  No.
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:22.861]  No, it'll be John Oliver forever.
[01:28:22.861 --> 01:28:25.862]  And it'll be Megyn Kelly forever.
[01:28:25.862 --> 01:28:28.403]  I guess when my grandkids try to search it.
[01:28:28.403 --> 01:28:29.484]  Who is our grandfather?
[01:28:29.484 --> 01:28:32.225]  Well, it's this is what he is.
[01:28:32.225 --> 01:28:33.965]  He's a bad person.
[01:28:33.965 --> 01:28:35.886]  It's an edited tape that Megyn Kelly put out.
[01:28:35.886 --> 01:28:36.526]  That's who he is.
[01:28:39.727 --> 01:28:43.689]  You know, I've made the point, like, the media acts like I killed the Sandy Hook kids.
[01:28:43.689 --> 01:28:51.113]  And now this poor guy's committed suicide, the media already puts my face up next to him, no one even knows why it happened, and it's just, it's Alex Jones' fault!
[01:28:51.113 --> 01:28:53.675]  And I can't even respond on any of their platforms!
[01:28:53.675 --> 01:28:55.296]  Because the corporate media are criminals!
[01:28:57.148 --> 01:29:03.493]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:29:03.493 --> 01:29:06.535]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:29:06.535 --> 01:29:12.479]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:29:12.479 --> 01:29:16.262]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:29:16.262 --> 01:29:17.522]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:29:17.522 --> 01:29:18.863]  Who do we fight for?
[01:29:18.863 --> 01:29:25.068]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:29:25.068 --> 01:29:26.509]  Available at Amazon Books.

[01:30:58.442 --> 01:31:00.803]  We all know the importance of fish oils.

[01:31:57.927 --> 01:32:06.557]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:32:06.557 --> 01:32:08.019]  Believe me, I know.
[01:32:08.019 --> 01:32:12.724]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:32:12.724 --> 01:32:17.730]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:38.114]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[01:33:00.818 --> 01:33:03.479]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.915 --> 01:33:22.839]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:33:24.966 --> 01:33:31.050]  You know, the globalists really, really, really want to abort as many unborn humans and Americans as they can.
[01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:40.795]  And then they want to make sure that they get formula that doesn't have half the protein or fat that is needed so that your child has a tiny brain.
[01:33:40.795 --> 01:33:43.017]  How they make the formula so low-level in Africa.
[01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:45.038]  Kids die by the tens of thousands.
[01:33:45.038 --> 01:33:47.359]  Same thing in Asia.
[01:33:47.359 --> 01:33:50.661]  And if that doesn't work, they want a bunch of tainted vaccines designed to cause brain damage.
[01:33:50.661 --> 01:33:51.402]  The inserts say so.
[01:33:53.971 --> 01:33:59.293]  And if they can't get that done, they'll try to teach their son to have their genitals cut off or be chemically castrated.
[01:33:59.293 --> 01:34:03.274]  They want to destroy civilization.
[01:34:03.274 --> 01:34:13.538]  But oh, do they care about the children when there's a shooting, even though it's one of the rarest forms of death for children who's been killed in a mass shooting.
[01:34:13.538 --> 01:34:17.079]  Still a tragedy.
[01:34:17.079 --> 01:34:20.660]  Ever thought about that?
[01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:22.541]  Democrats want to kill babies after they're born.
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:25.561]  And it's no big deal to them.
[01:34:25.561 --> 01:34:36.066]  And now, if you pull back, they want to euthanize old people.
[01:34:36.066 --> 01:34:46.052]  But they sure care about your kids and want them to take those vaccines, even though almost all the new cases of measles, it turns out, are in areas where illegal aliens are being brought in with no vetting.
[01:34:46.052 --> 01:34:48.894]  The Democrats say, yeah, don't stop them, just let them in.
[01:34:48.894 --> 01:34:53.056]  Well, if you've ever been to Ellis Island, they had quarantine for three to six months.
[01:34:54.332 --> 01:34:56.713]  For everybody.
[01:34:56.713 --> 01:35:01.555]  If you looked healthy at first shot, the doctor checked you out, you just had to stay there three months.
[01:35:01.555 --> 01:35:05.257]  You showed signs six months.
[01:35:05.257 --> 01:35:07.718]  Six months in solitary confinement.
[01:35:07.718 --> 01:35:10.259]  You had a nice window looking out at the Bay or New York City.
[01:35:17.116 --> 01:35:25.660]  All these famous people, medical doctors, famous Olympians are saying they're getting death threats because they say, hey, vaccines have a lot of bad reactions and I got sick from vaccines.
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:27.501]  Oh, I hope your kids die!
[01:35:27.501 --> 01:35:29.462]  That's how the left is.
[01:35:29.462 --> 01:35:33.485]  But then when there's a mass shooting, why?
[01:35:33.485 --> 01:35:34.665]  We've all got to turn our guns in.
[01:35:34.665 --> 01:35:36.426]  They love the children so much.
[01:35:36.426 --> 01:35:39.928]  Sandy Hook victim's father dies in apparent suicide in Newtown.
[01:35:39.928 --> 01:35:41.569]  What a tragedy.
[01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:44.390]  He apparently committed suicide.
[01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:45.411]  They haven't confirmed that yet.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:50.842]  The New York Times has a couple articles out, and what does the New York Times say?
[01:35:50.842 --> 01:35:55.884]  Mr. Jones has maintained that Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax.
[01:35:55.884 --> 01:35:58.585]  Has maintained.
[01:35:58.585 --> 01:36:09.089]  Maintained means continually, like you take care of your house, and let's say your foundation, or you take care of your teeth, or you maintain your physical health by trying to exercise and have a good diet.
[01:36:09.089 --> 01:36:10.870]  No, I've not.
[01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:12.351]  I've been all over the map for seven years.
[01:36:14.448 --> 01:36:15.969]  Been edited out of context.
[01:36:15.969 --> 01:36:18.291]  People have a right to question things, though.
[01:36:18.291 --> 01:36:20.373]  And I've told their lawyers face-to-face.
[01:36:20.373 --> 01:36:23.555]  And they've got the videos and the examples and the statements.
[01:36:23.555 --> 01:36:25.917]  And I went on Joe Rogan's show.
[01:36:25.917 --> 01:36:28.619]  It has 30-something million viewers when I went on.
[01:36:28.619 --> 01:36:30.080]  Second biggest podcast in history.
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:34.804]  And spent 20 minutes saying I believe it happened.
[01:36:34.804 --> 01:36:40.829]  But the New York Times sticks me in an article right after this poor man is found dead.
[01:36:42.216 --> 01:36:43.436]  And tries to include me in it.
[01:36:43.436 --> 01:36:44.857]  But hey, I ought to thank them.
[01:36:44.857 --> 01:36:50.258]  That's not very bad compared to all the other newspapers.
[01:36:50.258 --> 01:36:53.619]  Look at these!
[01:36:53.619 --> 01:36:55.919]  Alex Jones on the cover!
[01:36:55.919 --> 01:36:59.260]  Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman!
[01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:01.120]  A man's name I'd never said!
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:08.982]  That was a big problem, by the way, for the lawsuit.
[01:37:08.982 --> 01:37:10.603]  Never said his name!
[01:37:10.603 --> 01:37:11.623]  But now they're gonna say it.
[01:37:12.964 --> 01:37:16.266]  They're gonna say it for me.
[01:37:16.266 --> 01:37:19.387]  That's Westport News.
[01:37:19.387 --> 01:37:20.387]  New Haven Register.
[01:37:20.387 --> 01:37:21.288]  Oh, Alex Jones.
[01:37:21.288 --> 01:37:25.710]  Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman.
[01:37:25.710 --> 01:37:30.392]  And it goes on and on.
[01:37:30.392 --> 01:37:30.932]  Amazing.
[01:37:30.932 --> 01:37:33.493]  Very, very sad.
[01:37:33.493 --> 01:37:34.814]  Very, very sad.
[01:37:34.814 --> 01:37:38.736]  I'm gonna go to this very special report.
[01:37:41.656 --> 01:37:53.102]  That deals with New Zealand mosque attack and the way that you're not supposed to question it and how it's being used on a global scale to bring in censorship the world has never seen.
[01:37:53.102 --> 01:37:56.244]  Then the big exclusive Joe Rogan interview is coming up.
[01:37:56.244 --> 01:38:03.908]  Please don't forget we're lesser supported and we're willing to go through this hellstorm and you notice we're winning thanks to your prayers but we need your support.
[01:38:03.908 --> 01:38:08.770]  We have store-wide free shipping 50 to 60 percent off but a bunch of these specials are about to end.
[01:38:08.770 --> 01:38:09.371]  Take advantage of them.
[01:38:09.371 --> 01:38:09.851]  Here's the report.
[01:38:13.249 --> 01:38:25.172]  In his so-called manifesto, the Christchurch shooter wrote that his motive was to create a conflict over gun rights that will ultimately result in a civil war.
[01:38:25.172 --> 01:38:29.814]  And not only is the New Zealand government eager to comply with the shooter's desire.
[01:38:29.814 --> 01:38:32.515]  I can tell you one thing right now.
[01:38:32.515 --> 01:38:35.175]  Our gun laws will change.
[01:38:35.175 --> 01:38:39.237]  But they made it illegal to possess the video that was streamed on Facebook.
[01:38:40.597 --> 01:38:45.600]  And the mainstream media is telling you to not read the manifesto.
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:51.164]  Tyranny has taken root down under and asking questions is becoming a crime.
[01:38:51.164 --> 01:38:55.847]  Here's a list of suspicious activity that people are talking about.
[01:38:56.889 --> 01:39:09.982]  The suspect, Brenton Tarrant, had traveled to Israel, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia, Pakistan, and North Korea just years before the shooting.
[01:39:09.982 --> 01:39:16.389]  It was during this odyssey to Intelligentsia hotspots that friends say he changed.
[01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:25.374]  Within days of the attack, John Podesta was in New Zealand and described the country as a big, juicy target.
[01:39:25.374 --> 01:39:29.697]  John Podesta said New Zealand's a big, juicy target.
[01:39:29.697 --> 01:39:35.101]  In the video that Tarrant live-streamed on Facebook, there are anomalies.
[01:39:35.101 --> 01:39:38.163]  A barefoot victim suddenly has on blue socks.
[01:39:39.426 --> 01:39:45.370]  A loaded magazine seems to be waiting for the shooter on the floor inside the mosque.
[01:39:45.370 --> 01:39:49.733]  Shell casings seem to disappear into thin air.
[01:39:49.733 --> 01:39:57.418]  After firing hundreds of rounds in the main room, the walls remain untouched and the bodies unbloodied.
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:05.204]  During the shooting, there were at least two active drills scheduled in Christchurch.
[01:40:05.204 --> 01:40:16.091]  Ten miles west of the Masjid al-Nur Mosque, elite snipers from the NZSAS and other Asian countries were involved in a training exercise.
[01:40:17.392 --> 01:40:32.424]  And just three miles south, in an abandoned floor of Princess Margaret Hospital, the New Zealand Special Tactics Group, or STG, was practicing room clearing and dealing with armed offenders.
[01:40:32.424 --> 01:40:41.551]  28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant was charged with a single count of murder for killing an undisclosed person who is still alive.
[01:40:43.153 --> 01:40:50.760]  The police call it an administrative error and say they will update the charging documents to change the name.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.442]  Three others were arrested.
[01:40:52.442 --> 01:40:58.008]  Three people have been arrested in relation to this event.
[01:40:58.008 --> 01:41:00.891]  Multiple vehicles were found with explosives.
[01:41:02.833 --> 01:41:12.948]  And at the same time on the North Island, suspected explosive devices were found in an Auckland train station and safely blown up by the defence force.
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:26.103]  The very same mosque that was attacked has been written about in local news for radicalizing two young locals who later joined ISIS.
[01:41:26.103 --> 01:41:33.545]  The original article has been deleted and the government has doubled security to protect the Al Noor Mosque.
[01:41:34.925 --> 01:41:39.930]  A local Kiwi woman was arrested for an angry Facebook post.
[01:41:39.930 --> 01:41:44.995]  The Prime Minister encourages women to wear the hijab.
[01:41:44.995 --> 01:41:48.438]  And the entire nation observes the Islamic call to prayer.
[01:41:57.902 --> 01:42:02.868]  In Islam, they would call this a jihad, or a caliphate.
[01:42:02.868 --> 01:42:07.995]  And the government of New Zealand seems to be capitulating to it all.
[01:42:07.995 --> 01:42:12.801]  What a victory it will be for Islam to claim the city of Christ Church.
[01:42:14.302 --> 01:42:24.234]  Within days of the Christchurch shooting, a Muslim immigrant set fire to a school bus full of Italian school children to burn them alive in protest.
[01:42:24.234 --> 01:42:27.698]  And the mainstream media practically ignored it.
[01:42:27.698 --> 01:42:33.264]  Instead, they pine and beg for the same tyranny to destroy America.
[01:42:33.264 --> 01:42:34.566]  They want to keep you ignorant.
[01:42:35.186 --> 01:42:37.268]  Yeah, no wonder they don't want anybody investigating.
[01:42:37.268 --> 01:42:39.329]  It's up on InfoWars.com right now, the video.

[01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:11.144]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:44:11.144 --> 01:44:14.126]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:44:14.126 --> 01:44:15.866]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:44:15.866 --> 01:44:22.129]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.

[01:44:29.552 --> 01:44:32.514]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:44:32.514 --> 01:44:36.455]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:44:36.455 --> 01:44:40.417]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:44:40.417 --> 01:44:42.238]  I've got two in my home.
[01:44:42.238 --> 01:44:48.340]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:49.181]  Don't live
[01:44:50.001 --> 01:44:54.084]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[01:44:54.084 --> 01:44:58.467]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:44:58.467 --> 01:45:07.753]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:45:07.753 --> 01:45:10.615]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:45:10.615 --> 01:45:16.679]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:45:17.339 --> 01:45:23.604]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:45:23.604 --> 01:45:29.869]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:45:29.869 --> 01:45:36.815]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:45:37.976 --> 01:45:50.982]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:45:50.982 --> 01:45:55.244]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:45:55.244 --> 01:45:58.746]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[01:45:58.746 --> 01:46:01.807]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[01:46:01.807 --> 01:46:03.348]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:46:04.726 --> 01:46:07.692]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootworkstore.com.
[01:46:07.692 --> 01:46:11.721]  With MFootwork Select, it's the full spectrum of my patronage supply.
[01:46:13.314 --> 01:46:14.675]  Most respected companies out there.
[01:46:14.675 --> 01:46:22.438]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[01:46:33.584 --> 01:46:35.064]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:46:35.064 --> 01:46:39.046]  They've got three-month supplies, year's supplies, week emergency supplies.

[01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:47.333]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.

[01:46:52.339 --> 01:47:01.769]  InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWars Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:47:01.769 --> 01:47:04.452]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:10.015 --> 01:47:10.636]  Ooh, babe.
[01:47:10.636 --> 01:47:11.197]  Ooh, babe.
[01:47:11.197 --> 01:47:11.797]  Ooh, babe.
[01:47:11.797 --> 01:47:12.739]  Cosmo's gonna help me.
[01:47:33.888 --> 01:47:43.996]  I was going to air the hour and 15 minute Joe Rogan exclusive interview that I did last Friday in the next hour and I still intend to do that.
[01:47:43.996 --> 01:47:46.118]  There's so many big developments here.
[01:47:46.118 --> 01:47:52.783]  I just went ahead and told them post the full video to InfoWars.com and to NewsWars.com.
[01:47:52.783 --> 01:47:53.644]  We can pull that up.
[01:47:53.644 --> 01:47:55.445]  I'll give people the title.
[01:47:55.445 --> 01:48:01.370]  But it's see Joe Rogan's newest podcast with Alex Jones in Austin, Texas.
[01:48:03.570 --> 01:48:09.093]  It's very important that people see that interview, but I'm going to air some large excerpts of it in the next hour.
[01:48:09.093 --> 01:48:27.362]  Then Will Johnson's coming in, but the situation with Google, censoring, and how now computer scientists and top professors have looked at it and said, no, we can prove that they skewed votes to make Democrats win key congressional districts.
[01:48:29.248 --> 01:48:30.829]  That's election meddling.
[01:48:30.829 --> 01:48:33.870]  And that's Google using themselves as the supposed search engine to do it.
[01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:39.992]  But listen, it used to be an algorithm that whatever you liked the best, whatever you searched went to the top.
[01:48:39.992 --> 01:48:41.413]  So we were at the top.
[01:48:41.413 --> 01:48:43.273]  They broke the sucker.
[01:48:43.273 --> 01:48:44.834]  And you can't just halfway break it.
[01:48:44.834 --> 01:48:48.155]  Google's broke.
[01:48:48.155 --> 01:48:53.117]  And I showed this earlier of your TV viewer, but I want to do it when I'm standing up really professionally.
[01:48:54.968 --> 01:49:03.834]  And showing folks, but you can type in my name or other conservatives' names or other nationalists' names into YouTube, the biggest video site in the world.
[01:49:03.834 --> 01:49:05.275]  Over half the videos in the world are watched on it.
[01:49:05.275 --> 01:49:06.636]  I think it's like 70%.
[01:49:06.636 --> 01:49:07.496]  Look up that number.
[01:49:07.496 --> 01:49:10.819]  What percentage of online videos are watched on YouTube?
[01:49:10.819 --> 01:49:14.201]  It's like 70% last time I saw.
[01:49:14.201 --> 01:49:17.964]  And they will not let you search exact headlines of me.
[01:49:17.964 --> 01:49:21.046]  And then I went, let's check.
[01:49:23.086 --> 01:49:23.726]  Michael Savage.
[01:49:23.726 --> 01:49:24.526]  Let's check.
[01:49:24.526 --> 01:49:26.167]  And it was everybody.
[01:49:26.167 --> 01:49:29.208]  But Beto O'Rourke or Kamala Harris.
[01:49:29.208 --> 01:49:29.408]  Why?
[01:49:29.408 --> 01:49:32.529]  It's up to the minute.
[01:49:32.529 --> 01:49:35.370]  That is so criminal.
[01:49:35.370 --> 01:49:41.072]  And then Sundar gets up there in front of Congress and says, we're not censoring anything.
[01:49:41.072 --> 01:49:44.793]  When their own internal memos show what they're doing.
[01:49:44.793 --> 01:49:47.534]  It's dangerous.
[01:49:47.534 --> 01:49:51.335]  It's out of control.
[01:49:51.335 --> 01:49:52.195]  It's crazy.
[01:49:57.310 --> 01:50:02.832]  So again, let's go to YouTube.com.
[01:50:02.832 --> 01:50:05.053]  All of you can do this.
[01:50:05.053 --> 01:50:13.956]  Go to YouTube.com and type into the search box, Alex Jones.
[01:50:13.956 --> 01:50:26.300]  And when you've typed Alex Jones on, you see the first filter, without putting any filter on it, is the list of Megyn Kelly, John Oliver, The Guardian, Vice,
[01:50:27.423 --> 01:50:28.264]  CNBC.
[01:50:28.264 --> 01:50:31.347]  Now, it's all hit pieces.
[01:50:31.347 --> 01:50:34.711]  Not because they were popular, because they've been force-fed.
[01:50:34.711 --> 01:50:38.155]  That happened about... Well, that happened last August.
[01:50:38.155 --> 01:50:42.980]  Right when I got the platform, they also rigged it where all the top search results were hate pieces.
[01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:49.527]  And at first they didn't have any views, but then they... Some of those have like 20 million views because everybody searching Alex Jones only gets those.
[01:50:51.701 --> 01:50:56.522]  But people kept going deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper.
[01:50:56.522 --> 01:51:01.183]  And so, you could watch sometimes a hundred videos a minute being uploaded.
[01:51:01.183 --> 01:51:08.064]  I would go check it, and like, I couldn't even, and some would have 10,000 views, and some 100 views, but a day later, some would have like a million views.
[01:51:08.064 --> 01:51:10.304]  They would get deleted.
[01:51:10.304 --> 01:51:15.545]  But to get a million views in one day, what I actually said, people there trying to find it.
[01:51:15.545 --> 01:51:19.086]  So YouTube, starting on March 15th,
[01:51:20.728 --> 01:51:33.191]  With the Christchurch situation, they suddenly made it where no conservatives or no nationalists anywhere, it's not just me, can be searched.
[01:51:33.191 --> 01:51:36.672]  But Beto O'Rourke and the Democrats all still work.
[01:51:36.672 --> 01:51:39.933]  So by name, they don't let you search, period.
[01:51:39.933 --> 01:51:41.533]  They just give you what you want.
[01:51:41.533 --> 01:51:42.533]  That's called fraud.
[01:51:42.533 --> 01:51:46.034]  So click filter, please, for TV viewers.
[01:51:46.034 --> 01:51:47.255]  Okay, full screen, thank you.
[01:51:47.255 --> 01:51:48.315]  Now let's click last hour.
[01:51:51.971 --> 01:51:52.812]  Boom!
[01:51:52.812 --> 01:51:53.952]  Exact same results.
[01:51:53.952 --> 01:51:55.013]  Let's click.
[01:51:55.013 --> 01:51:59.756]  Now, used to there being, again, hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands in one hour of new videos.
[01:51:59.756 --> 01:52:04.199]  Let's click today.
[01:52:04.199 --> 01:52:06.781]  Same exact results for 100 pages deep.
[01:52:06.781 --> 01:52:07.281]  Let's go.
[01:52:07.281 --> 01:52:10.443]  Let's click this week.
[01:52:10.443 --> 01:52:11.484]  This week.
[01:52:11.484 --> 01:52:13.305]  Boom!
[01:52:13.305 --> 01:52:14.586]  All the same results.
[01:52:14.586 --> 01:52:15.747]  Now, let's click this year.
[01:52:20.333 --> 01:52:26.497]  Now you'll also notice almost all the videos, a hundred plus pages deep, as deep as I've gone, are all from a year ago.
[01:52:26.497 --> 01:52:32.501]  They just picked anti-stuff a year ago, and they just throw it up there, and that's what you get.
[01:52:32.501 --> 01:52:35.262]  So, you can go to the rest of Google.
[01:52:35.262 --> 01:52:36.163]  Google's the same.
[01:52:36.163 --> 01:52:37.144]  It owns YouTube.
[01:52:37.144 --> 01:52:37.704]  Same crap.
[01:52:39.246 --> 01:52:44.651]  You have to go to the URL InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:52:44.651 --> 01:52:47.313]  And yeah, we have our own commenting system.
[01:52:47.313 --> 01:52:49.155]  Doesn't work as good as Disqus did.
[01:52:49.155 --> 01:52:51.176]  They took that away from us.
[01:52:51.176 --> 01:52:52.658]  They took most of our bank accounts away.
[01:52:52.658 --> 01:52:53.999]  They took our PayPal away.
[01:52:53.999 --> 01:52:55.120]  They took our sponsors away.
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:56.901]  They took our ability to advertise away.
[01:52:56.901 --> 01:53:00.545]  They're taking it all away.
[01:53:00.545 --> 01:53:03.227]  As a beta test for you and everybody else.
[01:53:03.227 --> 01:53:03.788]  And guess what?
[01:53:03.788 --> 01:53:05.949]  Now it's here.
[01:53:05.949 --> 01:53:06.290]  It's here.
[01:53:08.317 --> 01:53:11.338]  Sean Hannity!
[01:53:11.338 --> 01:53:13.959]  Michael Savage!
[01:53:13.959 --> 01:53:16.320]  Tucker Carlson!
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:18.822]  Laura Ingraham!
[01:53:18.822 --> 01:53:21.523]  Lou Dobbs!
[01:53:21.523 --> 01:53:26.365]  They must have gotten in trouble for this because last week Trump was only sent videos.
[01:53:26.365 --> 01:53:30.406]  I checked it again yesterday and it was showing new videos.
[01:53:30.406 --> 01:53:31.167]  But let's see.
[01:53:31.167 --> 01:53:32.287]  Hell, let's test it live on air.
[01:53:32.287 --> 01:53:33.648]  Let's see if they're still blocking the President.
[01:53:34.394 --> 01:53:36.355]  Because they had the gall to do that.
[01:53:36.355 --> 01:53:38.757]  Let's go to Google, please.
[01:53:38.757 --> 01:53:44.920]  Hell, they banned his head of social media last week from posting, remember?
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:46.181]  Facebook did.
[01:53:46.181 --> 01:53:55.586]  Let's go back to YouTube and let's type in Donald Trump or President Trump.
[01:53:55.586 --> 01:53:57.628]  And let's see.
[01:53:57.628 --> 01:53:58.148]  Let's click it.
[01:54:00.131 --> 01:54:03.573]  And that's one hour ago, so the filter is not doing it now.
[01:54:03.573 --> 01:54:05.774]  They are giving it to the President.
[01:54:05.774 --> 01:54:09.275]  They weren't doing it as of yesterday, but oh, here's the thing.
[01:54:09.275 --> 01:54:15.458]  Google brags, and this professor is talking about it in articles up on drugreport.com, infowars.com, breitbart.com.
[01:54:15.458 --> 01:54:21.161]  Google search bias flips seats for Democrats in midterms and stole the election.
[01:54:21.161 --> 01:54:22.161]  They meddled.
[01:54:22.161 --> 01:54:24.522]  And it says they studied how they did it.
[01:54:24.522 --> 01:54:27.244]  They didn't always not let you see the other candidate.
[01:54:28.257 --> 01:54:37.184]  They would shave it statistically for what needed to make you not see the opposition candidate, or the leading candidate, the Republican candidate.
[01:54:37.184 --> 01:54:46.552]  So only some of the time, in the algorithm, do they not let you see Trump.
[01:54:46.552 --> 01:54:49.294]  But somebody like me, it's 100%.
[01:54:49.294 --> 01:54:53.577]  Let's go ahead and play that professor.
[01:54:53.577 --> 01:54:55.379]  The article's in full up on Infowars.
[01:54:57.938 --> 01:55:03.244]  We're almost out of time, but let me go ahead and get to that piece from RT.
[01:55:03.244 --> 01:55:03.565]  Here it is.
[01:55:04.557 --> 01:55:15.780]  We had field agents focusing on three congressional races in California, which were very hotly contested races in Republican districts.
[01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:22.642]  And we gave to these field agents about 500 election-related search terms.
[01:55:22.642 --> 01:55:27.023]  Each one had different search terms for different districts, where there were different issues, of course.
[01:55:27.983 --> 01:55:47.052]  And the point is, we simply looked at what kind of search results they received when they were conducting election-related searches, and we found very consistently that on Google they ended up with search results favoring
[01:55:47.792 --> 01:55:52.954]  Liberals and favoring liberal news sources, and it was quite a dramatic effect.
[01:55:52.954 --> 01:56:01.938]  And by the way, that disclaimer, that denial that you just played from Google, you have to listen very, very, very carefully to what they're saying.
[01:56:01.938 --> 01:56:04.539]  They're saying they don't re-rank.
[01:56:04.539 --> 01:56:05.959]  They're very careful in their denials.
[01:56:05.959 --> 01:56:06.459]  They don't re-rank.
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:10.082]  I've never claimed they re-rank anything.
[01:56:10.082 --> 01:56:26.474]  I'm just reporting on what they actually show people, and what they show people is dramatically biased enough in our 2018 elections to have shifted upwards of 78.2 million votes spread across different races in the U.S.
[01:56:26.474 --> 01:56:26.554]  in 2018.
[01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:31.512]  They call that b-b-b-b-b-b-b-bombshell!
[01:56:31.512 --> 01:56:32.913]  B-b-bombshell!
[01:56:32.913 --> 01:56:34.835]  But that's just one way they do it!
[01:56:34.835 --> 01:56:38.237]  In California they listed all Republicans as Nazis!
[01:56:38.237 --> 01:56:39.578]  Political affiliation!
[01:56:39.578 --> 01:56:42.080]  Nazi!
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:52.326]  And that is Senior Research Psychologist, Dr. Robert Epstein of the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, which is basically DARPA.
[01:56:52.326 --> 01:56:53.928]  He said it was a deciding factor
[01:56:54.887 --> 01:56:59.030]  And by the way, every race they looked at, the Democrats had stolen them.
[01:56:59.030 --> 01:57:04.214]  So Republicans had to have like a 30-point landslide to even win.
[01:57:04.214 --> 01:57:07.637]  And Trump's like, well, you just need to behave yourself and we'll still win.
[01:57:07.637 --> 01:57:09.818]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-Boulderdash!
[01:57:09.818 --> 01:57:11.680]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baloney!
[01:57:13.228 --> 01:57:14.610]  This is the real meddling.
[01:57:14.610 --> 01:57:15.190]  Get on it.
[01:57:15.190 --> 01:57:16.431]  Call the White House.
[01:57:16.431 --> 01:57:19.575]  We're going to post this segment of this live feed later.
[01:57:19.575 --> 01:57:25.661]  The total proof that Google stole the election and is currently rigging search results against conservatives.
[01:57:25.661 --> 01:57:27.683]  You just saw it if you're a TV viewer!
[01:57:27.683 --> 01:57:28.984]  Anybody can go do it for themselves!
[01:57:30.499 --> 01:57:32.100]  It's amazing!

[01:58:48.328 --> 01:58:56.150]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[01:58:56.150 --> 01:58:59.011]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:58:59.011 --> 01:59:02.572]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:59:02.572 --> 01:59:04.133]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:59:04.133 --> 01:59:10.695]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:59:10.695 --> 01:59:13.476]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been.
[01:59:14.554 --> 01:59:17.895]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[01:59:17.895 --> 01:59:20.816]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:59:20.816 --> 01:59:22.516]  That sends chills up my spine.
[01:59:22.516 --> 01:59:36.060]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[01:59:36.060 --> 01:59:38.001]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[01:59:38.661 --> 01:59:43.908]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[01:59:43.908 --> 01:59:51.337]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[01:59:51.337 --> 01:59:53.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:22.105 --> 02:00:31.098]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.098 --> 02:00:34.463]  You know, I'm not good at hyping things up.
[02:00:34.463 --> 02:00:36.305]  I just deliver.
[02:00:36.305 --> 02:00:36.426]  And...
[02:00:38.115 --> 02:00:46.718]  We've got the fact that we broke the Russian collusion as a smokescreen by Hillary and Obama to overturn the election and that that's really their Achilles heel of total crime.
[02:00:46.718 --> 02:00:48.819]  That's all confirmed now.
[02:00:48.819 --> 02:00:55.801]  We broke the fact that Google's fixing search results on a mass scale and I confronted the head of Google personally a few months ago.
[02:00:55.801 --> 02:00:57.222]  Now all that's coming out.
[02:00:57.222 --> 02:01:03.624]  You have top computer scientists that do work for DARPA that head up major institutes coming out proving
[02:01:04.517 --> 02:01:16.802]  That they stilted search results where you couldn't even see conservative candidates to 78 million voters and stole the midterms decisively.
[02:01:16.802 --> 02:01:18.222]  Decisively.
[02:01:18.222 --> 02:01:19.282]  They're the new phone book.
[02:01:19.282 --> 02:01:24.424]  It'd be like saying you can't put a conservative candidate in a phone book.
[02:01:24.424 --> 02:01:25.805]  But it's beyond that.
[02:01:25.805 --> 02:01:28.506]  And it's all the other big tech working in concert.
[02:01:28.506 --> 02:01:30.266]  Here's an example.
[02:01:30.266 --> 02:01:31.367]  I go to Lucy's Fried Chicken
[02:01:32.810 --> 02:01:40.351]  This weekend, and people come over to where I'm sitting and three times tell me, eat crap, we're gonna get you, just horrible, vicious threats.
[02:01:40.351 --> 02:01:43.392]  I leave, they're waiting outside the door, cussing and screaming at me.
[02:01:43.392 --> 02:01:45.832]  I have to walk around them and say, well, screw you back.
[02:01:45.832 --> 02:01:49.073]  They edit the tape, like I came over to them and did nothing.
[02:01:49.073 --> 02:01:51.853]  And then Reddit only allows the edited tape up.
[02:01:51.853 --> 02:01:53.434]  We put out the full tape.
[02:01:53.434 --> 02:01:58.235]  Reddit, as of this morning, will not let you post.
[02:01:58.235 --> 02:02:00.795]  Imagine the worship of the fraud.
[02:02:03.334 --> 02:02:05.175]  That's the moderators over the Austin subreddit.
[02:02:05.175 --> 02:02:11.900]  It's not as bad as the Donald, but I mean, this is like... Do you have to sue Reddit to make them stop that?
[02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:14.622]  Like, this is how the left operates.
[02:02:14.622 --> 02:02:22.167]  If we didn't have InfoWars, and God love them, they got a lot of problems, Fox News, you'd never know Jussie Smollett made that up.
[02:02:22.167 --> 02:02:24.409]  I first questioned it.
[02:02:24.409 --> 02:02:31.514]  If all we had was Reddit, and Google, and we had video that Jussie Smollett staged it, they wouldn't care!
[02:02:33.263 --> 02:02:34.064]  It doesn't matter!
[02:02:34.064 --> 02:02:35.585]  I have the video.
[02:02:35.585 --> 02:02:40.849]  I have the managers apologizing that they came over to my table to start a fight with me.
[02:02:40.849 --> 02:02:44.752]  And that I didn't respond three times.
[02:02:44.752 --> 02:02:51.618]  And then leaving, them flipping me off, cussing, saying they hope I die, eat sh-you-know-what.
[02:02:51.618 --> 02:02:53.519]  I'm like, well, I gotta go out this way anyways.
[02:02:53.519 --> 02:02:58.263]  I'm walking by him, and I'm walking by the guy saying it to me, and I'm like, get up then, man!
[02:02:58.263 --> 02:02:58.684]  Let's go!
[02:03:00.606 --> 02:03:02.226]  You're saying I'm gonna get it?
[02:03:02.226 --> 02:03:08.548]  You're about to, and he goes, security, he's at my table!
[02:03:08.548 --> 02:03:12.189]  These people are sick!
[02:03:12.189 --> 02:03:16.730]  But that's not what's sick!
[02:03:16.730 --> 02:03:26.813]  Saturday morning, my security, one of my security guys calls me and he goes, well, I guess you know it's the top of Reddit, what you did at Lucy's, or what happened at Lucy's, should have taken me with you.
[02:03:26.813 --> 02:03:27.473]  And I go, I know.
[02:03:29.332 --> 02:03:33.735]  I was going to eat dinner with Joe Rogan, and my wife didn't really like her dinner, so she wanted some oysters.
[02:03:33.735 --> 02:03:41.181]  So Joe went to his comedy club, and I went to Lucy's, and I had a bad feeling, and I'll take you next time, just so that, you know, if there's a witness.
[02:03:41.181 --> 02:03:47.026]  And I'm going to start having my security guy's body cams, just like, all the time, just have them on all the time, while the cops have them.
[02:03:47.026 --> 02:03:49.007]  Hell, I might start wearing one.
[02:03:49.007 --> 02:03:52.290]  But see, it doesn't even matter.
[02:03:53.171 --> 02:03:55.253]  Because I go, well, I shot video of it just in case.
[02:03:55.253 --> 02:03:56.113]  I figured they'd post it.
[02:03:56.113 --> 02:04:00.156]  I go, I'll go into the office and post it, because I can't just upload to YouTube or anywhere.
[02:04:00.156 --> 02:04:00.577]  I'm banned.
[02:04:00.577 --> 02:04:02.998]  I have to do it on my own platform.
[02:04:02.998 --> 02:04:04.299]  And so I come in a few hours early.
[02:04:04.299 --> 02:04:08.502]  I was already coming into the Sunday show, usually at about 1, to get ready for it at 4 o'clock.
[02:04:08.502 --> 02:04:09.403]  But I came in about noon.
[02:04:09.403 --> 02:04:11.184]  And we shot a live video.
[02:04:11.184 --> 02:04:12.125]  It's got a lot of cuss words.
[02:04:12.125 --> 02:04:12.585]  We put it out.
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:19.343]  I asked my staff that have Reddit accounts, I said, say, here's the raw video of what really happened.
[02:04:19.343 --> 02:04:25.087]  You'd think, oh, the leftists at Reddit said, no way, we're gonna guard those people.
[02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:40.345]  And that's their whole system of just cowardice and ganging up and lying and rigging the system and just being confident in that unified fraud because their god has dominion over this planet.
[02:04:40.345 --> 02:04:46.787]  And every major tech site is just run by the scum of the filthy earth.
[02:04:46.787 --> 02:04:49.248]  Unbelievable!
[02:04:49.248 --> 02:04:54.150]  Alex Jones accosts innocent babies.
[02:04:54.150 --> 02:04:55.371]  Why are they so crazy?
[02:04:56.189 --> 02:05:01.275]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[02:05:01.275 --> 02:05:04.198]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.
[02:05:04.198 --> 02:05:06.821]  So this is the best deal we've ever offered.

[02:06:01.110 --> 02:06:02.851]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:02.851 --> 02:06:15.097]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:15.097 --> 02:06:22.401]  All right, the full Joe Rogan interview that he taped with us last Friday,
[02:06:23.618 --> 02:06:34.026]  He's going to air right now, and it really gets powerful when he calls out the internet censors and how dangerous it is, and he gets into, wow, he's mellowed out in a lot of ways.
[02:06:34.026 --> 02:06:35.927]  It's a powerful interview.
[02:06:35.927 --> 02:06:39.850]  The last interview I did with him is the second largest podcast in history.
[02:06:39.850 --> 02:06:42.432]  That's obviously on a platform where I'm not censored, Joe Show.
[02:06:43.757 --> 02:06:53.799]  This, of course, is Alex Jones interviewing someone, and so the gods of control will try to block it, but they can't stop you from where we have it posted in our own format at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:53.799 --> 02:06:57.300]  We have it posted on some other places where you can spread it, and it's free to air.
[02:06:57.300 --> 02:06:58.260]  Anybody can post this.
[02:06:58.260 --> 02:06:59.480]  Anybody can use this.
[02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:11.463]  Anybody can do what you want with it, but I'm going to air a few segments of it because there's been so many big developments on the Mueller front and how the Democrats are responding that I'm going to be coming back later in the hour to get into this, but if you just joined us,
[02:07:12.847 --> 02:07:16.809]  Total proof by top computer scientists that Google stole the election.
[02:07:16.809 --> 02:07:23.652]  These are nonpartisan people, most of them actually Democrats, but they believe in real elections and that Google has too much power.
[02:07:23.652 --> 02:07:24.933]  And we also have
[02:07:26.158 --> 02:07:34.144]  Proven, we showed the video earlier, anybody can do this, that conservatives are banned from searchability on YouTube.
[02:07:34.144 --> 02:07:35.264]  Just period.
[02:07:35.264 --> 02:07:42.710]  And so that video will be uploaded in the next 30 minutes to InfoWars.com, the proof that that all happened.
[02:07:42.710 --> 02:07:55.599]  Not just research shows they flipped major seats for Democrats in the midterms, but that they also are rigging search results where you can't even find conservatives, searching for them is banned entirely.
[02:07:56.738 --> 02:08:03.180]  And then only negative comments and negative videos are hand-fed into it.
[02:08:03.180 --> 02:08:07.481]  It's unbelievable coordination and fraud.
[02:08:07.481 --> 02:08:10.282]  And then a lot of congressmen say, no, no, no, this is going on.
[02:08:10.282 --> 02:08:11.242]  So it's amazing.
[02:08:11.242 --> 02:08:14.803]  But here is large segments of the Joe Rogan interview.
[02:08:14.803 --> 02:08:16.244]  Stay with us.
[02:08:16.244 --> 02:08:24.626]  Well, this is going to be quite the commercial-free, raw, teleprompter-free, talking-point-free transmission.
[02:08:26.374 --> 02:08:33.699]  Joe Rogan undoubtedly has the largest program in the world, not just on TV, not just on radio, but on the internet.
[02:08:33.699 --> 02:08:39.603]  The largest regular podcast in the world dwarfing, in many ways, what the NFL has viewing it.
[02:08:40.911 --> 02:08:49.021]  And I am the most banned person in the world who has routinely also had the largest radio or TV show on the planet.
[02:08:49.021 --> 02:08:54.988]  So this is quite a meeting of the minds, and I've known Joe since 1999 or so, known him good for about 17, 18 years.
[02:08:56.870 --> 02:09:23.593]  uh... and i've never seen him show satisfied in a good way uh... so so happy uh... so so content uh... because he was always driven world champion taekwondo even fighting up above his rank and winning that even the heavyweight a big ufc guy movie star a bunch of big tv shows news radio going through all the stuff you've done but now you seem finally satisfied
[02:09:24.714 --> 02:09:30.601]  Because Joe, you're now officially the world heavyweight champion of all media.
[02:09:30.601 --> 02:09:34.606]  Something Howard Stern said he did, but he never really did.
[02:09:34.606 --> 02:09:36.709]  So Howard Stern would tell us... No, I don't think it's Howard Stern.
[02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:37.389]  Good guy.
[02:09:37.389 --> 02:09:38.311]  Very nice fellow.
[02:09:38.311 --> 02:09:40.874]  The point is, he just calls me to be banned off the internet.
[02:09:40.874 --> 02:09:41.755]  Even though it's Mr. Free Speech.
[02:09:41.755 --> 02:09:42.856]  But seriously, you...
[02:09:43.917 --> 02:09:44.217]  All right.
[02:10:14.124 --> 02:10:15.798]  Three friends commit suicide this year.
[02:10:17.148 --> 02:10:20.029]  And you just realize what's important and what's not important.
[02:10:20.029 --> 02:10:27.912]  There's a lot of things we dwell on that are just nonsense and this life has a lot of beautiful things to it.
[02:10:27.912 --> 02:10:46.240]  There's a lot of it that's great and I've chosen to spend more time thinking about the good things and thinking about the positive aspects of life and friends and friendship and things that I enjoy doing like stand-up and podcasts and the UFC and not being so tense about things.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:47.901]  I've worked hard at it.
[02:10:47.901 --> 02:10:49.301]  I'm not always good at it.
[02:10:49.301 --> 02:10:55.664]  You know, I have my good days and my bad days like everybody else, but I just, you know, I just think I've gotten wiser.
[02:10:55.664 --> 02:10:56.685]  At least I've tried.
[02:10:59.215 --> 02:11:02.316]  So you're not satisfied because you're number one.
[02:11:02.316 --> 02:11:05.176]  You're saying you're just satisfied because you've gotten older and you've figured out stuff.
[02:11:05.176 --> 02:11:08.357]  I don't think about the number one thing.
[02:11:08.357 --> 02:11:15.358]  I know the podcast does really well, but what I concentrate on is just trying to do the best show that I can and have fun.
[02:11:15.358 --> 02:11:18.579]  And the only way that I can do the best show that I can is to have fun with it.
[02:11:18.579 --> 02:11:20.719]  I mean, to be prepared, but also to have fun.
[02:11:20.719 --> 02:11:21.740]  So that's what I think about.
[02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:22.800]  I don't think about, like,
[02:11:24.039 --> 02:11:29.285]  You know, I don't think about dominating ratings or anything like that, or continuing to do that.
[02:11:29.285 --> 02:11:32.328]  I support everybody... You know, almost everybody else in media is totally obsessed with it.
[02:11:33.460 --> 02:11:34.201]  Obsessed with what ratings?
[02:11:34.201 --> 02:11:35.221]  Obsessed with being number one.
[02:11:35.221 --> 02:11:39.063]  Yeah, that just seems to me like you either are or you aren't.
[02:11:39.063 --> 02:11:40.424]  And if you aren't, it doesn't matter.
[02:11:40.424 --> 02:11:42.385]  There's so many people in this world.
[02:11:42.385 --> 02:11:45.547]  There's hundreds of millions of people just in this country.
[02:11:45.547 --> 02:11:46.928]  You don't have to be number one.
[02:11:46.928 --> 02:11:50.570]  You just have to be something for somebody.
[02:11:50.570 --> 02:11:52.211]  You just have to be entertaining.
[02:11:52.211 --> 02:11:54.212]  I mean, we're in the entertainment business.
[02:11:54.212 --> 02:11:58.215]  You're more of an information distributor.
[02:11:58.215 --> 02:12:01.196]  Do you consider yourself a journalist?
[02:12:01.196 --> 02:12:02.097]  How do you consider yourself?
[02:12:02.677 --> 02:12:12.040]  I'm just somebody who's freaked out by what's going on, like human-animal hybrids and, you know, the Hadron Super Collider and all this crazy stuff that nobody even seems to care.
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:13.160]  So I get freaked out about that.
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:14.021]  So I'm just kind of a man.
[02:12:14.021 --> 02:12:16.501]  You ever talk to someone from CERN?
[02:12:16.501 --> 02:12:17.802]  I've tried to get CERN on the show.
[02:12:17.802 --> 02:12:21.303]  I did have the head of Harp on once, the civilian head.
[02:12:21.303 --> 02:12:23.784]  And then a colonel popped in during the break and said he said too much.
[02:12:23.784 --> 02:12:24.584]  Click, interview's over.
[02:12:24.584 --> 02:12:27.745]  He's like, well, we do set the atmosphere on fire at night, but not about me.
[02:12:28.615 --> 02:12:33.700]  Because I said I wanted to get you in here, and I wanted to do a calm interview.
[02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:36.963]  I just did the big motor-mouth intro and the rest of it.
[02:12:36.963 --> 02:12:40.206]  So we talked about the fact that you agree, though, you're the most satisfied with your life.
[02:12:40.703 --> 02:12:48.446]  Yeah, yeah, I think in some ways, but like when it comes to stand-up, right now I'm in the middle of putting together a new hour.
[02:12:48.446 --> 02:12:51.227]  I released my Netflix special in October.
[02:12:51.227 --> 02:13:01.831]  And so in that sense, this is like the least satisfied time for me because there's a period every two years I release a stand-up special on Netflix.
[02:13:02.891 --> 02:13:07.856]  And then for the next 10 to 11 months, it's chaos.
[02:13:07.856 --> 02:13:09.477]  And that's where I'm at right now.
[02:13:09.477 --> 02:13:15.963]  Constantly reworking material, rewriting it, performing almost every night except usually Monday and Tuesday.
[02:13:15.963 --> 02:13:17.944]  Or Sunday and Monday.
[02:13:17.944 --> 02:13:21.447]  I'll take like two days off a week, but I'm doing three, four sets a night.
[02:13:21.447 --> 02:13:24.090]  Always writing, always reworking stuff.
[02:13:24.090 --> 02:13:26.392]  So in that sense, it's not satisfied at all.
[02:13:27.455 --> 02:13:31.239]  By the way, that's extremely Americana, say left or right.
[02:13:31.239 --> 02:13:38.549]  If I tried to quantify Joe Rogan, I would say Americana from Boston, an extreme work ethic.
[02:13:38.549 --> 02:13:44.416]  Because I know people that know you a lot better than I do and they say, man, Joe works like 15, 16 hours a day and he's like really focused.
[02:13:46.707 --> 02:13:48.369]  That's something that we're really missing as a country.
[02:13:48.369 --> 02:13:55.716]  Because I hear you talk about these exercise experts you have on, and all these amazing guests, and that Delta Force guy you had on was really amazing.
[02:13:55.716 --> 02:14:02.002]  When I talk about people being fat slobs, I'm not on some high horse, because I'm a fat slob myself, but I still exercise more than most people.
[02:14:02.002 --> 02:14:04.044]  I can't imagine where we're going to go
[02:14:04.705 --> 02:14:12.632]  As all the statistics show, people are getting softer, they're getting stupider, and it's not like I'm looking, oh these people are idiots, they're soft, I'm soft too.
[02:14:12.632 --> 02:14:16.836]  But compared to most soft people, I'm on the high end, not the low end.
[02:14:16.836 --> 02:14:17.216]  It's scary.
[02:14:17.216 --> 02:14:20.038]  I have an article in the Daily Mail, a big archaeology study.
[02:14:20.839 --> 02:14:21.480]  We're good to go.
[02:14:43.055 --> 02:14:50.159]  Well, if you look at lower hominids, you know, if you look at chimps and orangutans, they're so much stronger than us.
[02:14:50.159 --> 02:14:56.182]  And we evolved from lower hominids, but our world does not require physical strength.
[02:14:56.182 --> 02:15:01.004]  Our world, it barely requires mental strength anymore.
[02:15:01.004 --> 02:15:02.665]  I mean, everything is kind of spelled out for you.
[02:15:04.773 --> 02:15:12.076]  There's certain jobs, of course, that will require you to use your brain, but a lot of them just require you to follow directions, you know?
[02:15:12.076 --> 02:15:22.260]  And I think as we become less and less physical, and as discipline, like physical discipline in particular, becomes less and less important, you're going to continue to see people being weaker and weaker.
[02:15:22.260 --> 02:15:26.982]  But there's real benefits as a person, as a human being, to exercising discipline.
[02:15:26.982 --> 02:15:31.784]  There's real benefits to hard work, you know, because you have a, there's peace of mind.
[02:15:33.345 --> 02:15:37.229]  If there's one reason why I'm satisfied, it's because I do everything I'm supposed to do.
[02:15:37.229 --> 02:15:39.491]  Like, in terms of the work that I'm supposed to do.
[02:15:39.491 --> 02:15:46.357]  I don't have any weird feeling that I'm not doing enough, or I'm not doing the right amount of stuff, or maybe I should be performing.
[02:15:46.357 --> 02:15:51.201]  Your genetic memory says, I'm a man, I've got a family, I'm successful, I'm working out, I'm fighting.
[02:15:51.201 --> 02:15:51.902]  I'm a human.
[02:15:51.902 --> 02:15:52.062]  Yeah.
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:56.601]  Maybe not today.
[02:15:56.601 --> 02:15:57.902]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:15:57.902 --> 02:16:01.624]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.

[02:16:56.099 --> 02:17:00.022]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.022 --> 02:17:01.563]  I sued the IRS and won.

[02:19:59.170 --> 02:20:11.141]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:11.141 --> 02:20:13.523]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:13.523 --> 02:20:14.885]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:18.325 --> 02:20:20.146]  You gotta know what kind of human you are.
[02:20:20.146 --> 02:20:25.949]  I don't think everybody should have to work out the way I do, but I think everybody like me has to work out the way I do.
[02:20:25.949 --> 02:20:28.430]  Because if you don't, you don't think straight.
[02:20:28.430 --> 02:20:34.213]  I was about to say, because I've never gotten super shaped like you, but I used to run six miles every other day.
[02:20:34.213 --> 02:20:35.674]  You were jacked when you were younger, man.
[02:20:35.674 --> 02:20:37.715]  I saw pictures of you when you were working out.
[02:20:37.715 --> 02:20:38.675]  And then I kind of stopped doing it.
[02:20:38.675 --> 02:20:41.057]  And then once you get fat and really out of shape, it's hard to get back.
[02:20:42.117 --> 02:20:47.920]  When I like, like this morning, I hiked around a couple miles, went up a few big hills that are like, you know, three quarters of a mile.
[02:20:47.920 --> 02:20:51.322]  And the blood pumping through my brain, I was having the best thoughts ever.
[02:20:51.322 --> 02:20:51.742]  Yeah.
[02:20:51.742 --> 02:20:55.504]  Once, like the blood is energizing the brain, it's electrochemical.
[02:20:55.504 --> 02:20:57.945]  And I was just like, God, I wish my back wasn't hurting.
[02:20:57.945 --> 02:20:59.346]  I'd be packing for five hours.
[02:20:59.346 --> 02:20:59.526]  Yeah.
[02:21:00.246 --> 02:21:01.807]  Yeah, a lot of writers like to do that.
[02:21:01.807 --> 02:21:10.391]  They like to write in the morning, and then they go for a walk afterwards, go for a hike, and get the blood pumping, and then while they're hiking, then they think about the writing.
[02:21:10.391 --> 02:21:11.891]  They think about what they wrote.
[02:21:11.891 --> 02:21:24.837]  Exactly, like I'll be on the elliptical, and again, not that I'm in shape, but like about an hour, about 30 minutes in, I don't even watch TV or listen to music anymore, I'll just be doing this, and all of a sudden it's like, ow, whoa, and it's like I can't capture that magic once I'm off there.
[02:21:25.137 --> 02:21:27.559]  Well, there's a real benefit to doing it without music, too.
[02:21:27.559 --> 02:21:32.942]  I like to listen to music, and I like to listen to books on tape and podcasts and stuff sometimes when I'm on it.
[02:21:32.942 --> 02:21:33.583]  Books on tape.
[02:21:33.583 --> 02:21:35.564]  But I also like to not.
[02:21:35.564 --> 02:21:42.929]  I like to do it with nothing, because I think that, especially after like 15, 20 minutes of constantly pushing, it's a meditative thing.
[02:21:42.929 --> 02:21:48.213]  You start getting into the breathing, you're concentrating on your breathing, and you're not thinking about anything.
[02:21:48.553 --> 02:21:57.741]  And then all the other problems that you may or might have, might not have, whatever issues you might have in your life, they become less and less significant.
[02:21:57.741 --> 02:22:02.405]  They become more, you have a balanced perspective based on physical exertion.
[02:22:02.405 --> 02:22:07.629]  Because when you're really exhausted, your body's really thinking, it's trying to stay alive, right?
[02:22:07.629 --> 02:22:16.457]  You're running up a hill and you're doing sprints and you realize you got a hundred yards to go and you're, you have no room in your head for bull****.
[02:22:17.257 --> 02:22:17.717]  There's no room.
[02:22:17.717 --> 02:22:27.683]  And that's what's crazy is I'm hobbling up this hill and like 90% of it I have these incredible understandings of my family life.
[02:22:27.683 --> 02:22:28.203]  Yeah.
[02:22:28.203 --> 02:22:30.964]  And the problem is once then I get in the car and driving home I can't remember it.
[02:22:30.964 --> 02:22:31.505]  Right.
[02:22:31.505 --> 02:22:33.926]  But I think that environment's unnatural.
[02:22:33.926 --> 02:22:39.609]  Us being in the car, us being at a desk, us being in studios with lights and all, that's the unnatural part.
[02:22:39.609 --> 02:22:41.970]  The natural part puts things into perspective.
[02:22:41.970 --> 02:22:45.852]  Physical exertion, breathing, it makes you understand like what is important.
[02:22:46.232 --> 02:22:50.415]  Puts it all in perspective, like what do you really want out of this life?
[02:22:50.415 --> 02:22:51.836]  What means something to you?
[02:23:17.273 --> 02:23:18.674]  You had a really big idea.
[02:23:18.674 --> 02:23:23.176]  We were talking a few weeks ago on the phone when I came out and did your podcast, which is the second biggest ever.
[02:23:23.176 --> 02:23:25.278]  I want to be number one and beat Elon Musk.
[02:23:25.278 --> 02:23:25.758]  Great guy.
[02:23:25.758 --> 02:23:27.939]  Hopefully I'll get there.
[02:23:27.939 --> 02:23:34.363]  But you're like trying to, we talked like an hour before we went on air for that four hour plus epic podcast.
[02:23:34.363 --> 02:23:35.644]  And I'm just hyped about the podcast.
[02:23:35.644 --> 02:23:38.426]  You're trying to really layer your bumps and really important points.
[02:23:39.502 --> 02:23:42.965]  That when I sat back, I thought, wow, that's like the biggest issue there is of our time.
[02:23:42.965 --> 02:23:45.787]  And he's talking about something that nobody else is talking about.
[02:23:45.787 --> 02:23:47.869]  I mean, you really were doing that.
[02:23:47.869 --> 02:23:53.433]  And then I watched the big podcast with the head of Twitter and his lawyer.
[02:23:53.433 --> 02:23:56.996]  They were obfuscating and dodging so much in lawyer speak.
[02:23:56.996 --> 02:24:01.100]  They had a real chance to hit a home run, just be honest, that you never really got to your main point.
[02:24:01.100 --> 02:24:02.181]  I mean, people loved it.
[02:24:02.181 --> 02:24:02.641]  It was epic.
[02:24:02.641 --> 02:24:03.061]  It was great.
[02:24:04.229 --> 02:24:09.071]  Well, you spend five minutes without me, which is hard, so I've got ADHD.
[02:24:09.071 --> 02:24:26.216]  To get into your big idea that after we had the podcast for four and a half hours, and I'm eating steak, you're trying to tell me, and I'm too busy, you know, drinking red wine, because it really is the big debate of you've got 90 plus percent of the internet on three or four platforms.
[02:24:27.355 --> 02:24:33.381]  As you said at dinner, a murderer gets 10 years in prison, but Alex Jones is banned for life.
[02:24:33.381 --> 02:24:40.107]  Well, not just you, but people that say learn to code get banned forever.
[02:24:40.107 --> 02:24:42.809]  I mean, there's... So listen, you're going to have a floor.
[02:24:42.809 --> 02:24:43.069]  Please.
[02:24:43.069 --> 02:24:47.854]  But here's the thing, I don't want to get lost in Jack Dorsey or his lawyer or you being nice.
[02:24:47.854 --> 02:24:49.776]  So I want you to really go on your rant like you did at dinner.
[02:24:50.356 --> 02:24:51.617]  It was really smart stuff you were saying.
[02:24:51.617 --> 02:24:57.182]  I was like, wow, we should be having a discussion about pathways to people to get back on those platforms.
[02:24:57.182 --> 02:24:58.763]  It's not like we're kissing their ass.
[02:24:58.763 --> 02:25:00.185]  They're going to get sued.
[02:25:00.185 --> 02:25:02.046]  They're going to get attacked, which I don't want to happen.
[02:25:02.046 --> 02:25:09.332]  It's like, it's like Kennedy said, those that make peaceful discussions impossible make violent revolutions inevitable, to paraphrase.
[02:25:09.332 --> 02:25:14.517]  So I'm not threatening violence, but obviously I've got clips we're going to play of the head of YouTube.
[02:25:14.517 --> 02:25:15.418]  I'm sure she's a nice lady.
[02:25:16.331 --> 02:25:24.895]  Being attacked by this journalist she's on with saying my son likes Ben Shapiro so I want to ban him like Alex Jones and she's like well we're working on it.
[02:25:24.895 --> 02:25:30.937]  They don't even get that they're out in the open like they're God when it's people like you and everybody else that built YouTube.
[02:25:30.937 --> 02:25:33.819]  Well particularly saying ban Ben Shapiro.
[02:25:33.819 --> 02:25:35.840]  Ben Shapiro is a very reasonable guy.
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:40.422]  You can't ban someone just because you disagree with them and that's this is part of the problem.
[02:25:40.422 --> 02:25:41.002]  He's beating them.
[02:25:41.002 --> 02:25:41.202]  Right.
[02:25:41.202 --> 02:25:44.323]  Well it's part of the problem with the ideology that the left has.
[02:25:44.323 --> 02:25:45.484]  They feel like because
[02:25:46.164 --> 02:25:54.168]  That left-leaning companies like Google and Facebook and Apple and these tech companies are all left.
[02:25:54.168 --> 02:26:01.812]  So I think a lot of people who are also on the left who disagree with people on the right, like Ben Shapiro, they want them to ban these people.
[02:26:01.812 --> 02:26:02.492]  Ban them!
[02:26:02.492 --> 02:26:03.173]  Get away!
[02:26:03.173 --> 02:26:03.853]  Take them away!
[02:26:03.853 --> 02:26:05.294]  That is not the answer.
[02:26:05.294 --> 02:26:06.475]  It's never been the answer.
[02:26:07.495 --> 02:26:15.082]  If you want to ban someone for doxxing people, if you want to ban someone for threatening people or harassing people, these are different things.
[02:26:15.082 --> 02:26:18.585]  You're talking about people that are doing something that could be considered a crime.
[02:26:18.585 --> 02:26:24.730]  But you've got people talking about banning people for having different opinions on things.
[02:26:24.730 --> 02:26:31.776]  You're talking about people who support certain religions, like Islam, because they don't want to appear Islamophobic.
[02:26:32.216 --> 02:26:38.299]  But they don't want to support Christian religions and Christian ideals with the same enthusiasm.
[02:26:38.299 --> 02:26:45.703]  Because they feel like they can s**t on those religions and it's, you know, we have an open season for them in this country.
[02:26:45.703 --> 02:26:53.467]  I think there's a real problem with people even not wanting to have discussions.
[02:26:53.467 --> 02:26:55.228]  You have to be able to talk to people.
[02:26:55.228 --> 02:26:55.828]  No, I agree.
[02:26:55.828 --> 02:26:57.489]  You have to be able to talk to people reasonably.
[02:26:57.489 --> 02:26:59.430]  Universities are supposed to be these passions.
[02:26:59.430 --> 02:27:00.431]  So getting into that,
[02:27:01.496 --> 02:27:09.321]  Before we get into, as you're pointing this out, I can't believe she's openly saying she's working on banning Ben Shapiro.
[02:27:09.321 --> 02:27:20.968]  I mean, this is the same woman that said that the James Damore, the Google memo, that she was upset because it reinforced harmful gender stereotypes.
[02:27:20.968 --> 02:27:22.209]  It was science.
[02:27:22.209 --> 02:27:26.832]  Even Bloomberg, Michael Bloomberg came out and said, I'm not running as a Democrat.
[02:27:27.867 --> 02:27:30.869]  Because they're all saying whites are inherently evil.
[02:27:30.869 --> 02:27:36.474]  Martin Luther King said, you don't judge somebody off what color they are, you judge them off what they produce.
[02:27:36.474 --> 02:27:39.837]  Yeah, I don't think most Democrats are saying whites are inherently evil.
[02:27:39.837 --> 02:27:48.283]  The problem is, the fringe, the far left, are so loud and vocal with some of their rhetoric that everyone gets lumped into them.
[02:27:48.283 --> 02:27:49.985]  I agree with you.
[02:27:49.985 --> 02:27:52.467]  But if I tune into CNN or MSNBC, that's what I see, Joe.
[02:27:53.038 --> 02:27:55.680]  You see some of that because they think it's acceptable.
[02:27:55.680 --> 02:27:57.000]  I mean, that's part of what it is.
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:57.661]  But who wants to?
[02:27:57.661 --> 02:27:58.721]  I don't want to hate people.
[02:27:58.721 --> 02:27:59.542]  I don't want to either.
[02:27:59.542 --> 02:28:01.883]  I think there's a lot of sheep think going on.
[02:28:01.883 --> 02:28:03.804]  People are seeing the tide.
[02:28:03.804 --> 02:28:08.247]  They're licking their finger, they're putting it up in the air, they're finding out which way the wind's blowing, and then they're going that way.
[02:28:08.247 --> 02:28:10.929]  Because it's very difficult to formulate opinions on your own.
[02:28:10.929 --> 02:28:17.573]  It's much easier to just adopt a predetermined pattern of thinking that other people have already laid out in front of you.
[02:28:17.573 --> 02:28:18.153]  They just repeat it.
[02:28:18.153 --> 02:28:19.874]  Especially if it's in your industry.
[02:28:20.154 --> 02:28:22.996]  Which is what I think happened at Google with James Damore.
[02:28:22.996 --> 02:28:32.823]  I think you get these groupthink sort of environments, where these left-wing ideologies just spread throughout the company, and if you show any deviation from that, you're shunned.
[02:28:32.823 --> 02:28:34.064]  And there's a feedback loop?
[02:28:34.064 --> 02:28:34.764]  Yes.
[02:28:34.764 --> 02:28:36.525]  In James Damore's case, he was fired.
[02:28:36.525 --> 02:28:41.389]  He's a very nice guy, and a very reasonable guy, and he's not sexist by any stretch of the imagination.
[02:28:41.389 --> 02:28:44.691]  And these things have been labeled... He's just not going to be the villain, because he's a male.
[02:28:46.233 --> 02:28:47.334]  He's a scientist.
[02:28:47.334 --> 02:28:50.198]  I mean, this is really what the guy... He's an engineer.
[02:28:50.198 --> 02:28:53.984]  He's a guy who went into the science and wrote a paper about...
[02:28:54.912 --> 02:28:57.254]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[02:28:57.254 --> 02:29:00.157]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[02:29:00.157 --> 02:29:05.221]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:29:05.221 --> 02:29:12.408]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:29:12.408 --> 02:29:16.972]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:29:17.558 --> 02:29:21.100]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:24.322]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:29:24.322 --> 02:29:26.943]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:29:26.943 --> 02:29:28.444]  Get sober now.
[02:29:28.444 --> 02:29:31.786]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.
[02:29:31.786 --> 02:29:32.587]  It's simple.

[02:29:56.052 --> 02:30:06.655]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:30:06.655 --> 02:30:08.716]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:30:08.716 --> 02:30:11.577]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:30:11.577 --> 02:30:13.057]  It's made in the USA.
[02:30:13.057 --> 02:30:19.899]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:30:19.899 --> 02:30:21.120]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[02:30:21.980 --> 02:30:31.663]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:30:31.663 --> 02:30:48.488]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those rush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:30:48.488 --> 02:30:51.649]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:30:51.769 --> 02:30:55.133]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:31:10.720 --> 02:31:12.081]  Most respected companies out there.
[02:31:12.081 --> 02:31:19.844]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[02:32:59.092 --> 02:33:01.894]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:07.921 --> 02:33:09.862]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:09.862 --> 02:33:24.146]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.146 --> 02:33:32.529]  And we are back live.
[02:33:32.529 --> 02:33:36.130]  I just aired 20 minutes of a powerful Joe Rogan interview.
[02:33:37.993 --> 02:33:41.095]  The full interview is up on Infowars.com.
[02:33:41.095 --> 02:33:45.538]  We've got so much big breaking news that I'm going to air the rest of it for radio and TV viewers tomorrow.
[02:33:45.538 --> 02:33:52.543]  But if you're on the internet and want to get around the censors and really make them upset, go to Infowars.com and there it is posted.
[02:33:52.543 --> 02:33:55.005]  Joe Rogan does a new podcast with Alex Jones.
[02:33:55.005 --> 02:33:59.928]  See Joe Rogan's new podcast with Alex Jones in Austin, Texas.
[02:33:59.928 --> 02:34:03.331]  And Joe's really popular across the political spectrum.
[02:34:04.505 --> 02:34:13.668]  And I got really mad at Joe because he knows about the censorship, knew it was going on, had been anti-censorship before, but really wasn't standing up for myself and others.
[02:34:13.668 --> 02:34:17.350]  So I got really vicious about the whole thing.
[02:34:17.350 --> 02:34:24.332]  And then I saw Joe really turn the corner.
[02:34:24.332 --> 02:34:27.013]  And I'm just proud of what he did.
[02:34:27.013 --> 02:34:32.135]  In fact, let's air a few more minutes of Joe.
[02:34:33.686 --> 02:34:35.687]  Then I'm going to come back and get into this big breaking news.
[02:34:35.687 --> 02:34:37.027]  Here it is.
[02:34:37.027 --> 02:34:38.788]  But the guy, he's an engineer.
[02:34:38.788 --> 02:34:49.613]  He's a guy who went into the science and wrote a paper about the science of the differences in general of men and women when it comes to what they're interested in doing.
[02:34:49.613 --> 02:34:55.735]  And even wrote a page and a half about strategies to encourage women to get into tech.
[02:34:55.735 --> 02:34:59.217]  He's not reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes.
[02:34:59.217 --> 02:34:59.757]  You get the key.
[02:35:00.057 --> 02:35:00.698]  We're good to go.
[02:35:15.394 --> 02:35:19.316]  I think she is probably a product of the very environment that she works in.
[02:35:19.316 --> 02:35:22.938]  Look, she's running this thing and it's a gigantic left-wing thing.
[02:35:22.938 --> 02:35:28.501]  This think tank, this mindset that permeates the entire establishment, she's a part of it.
[02:35:28.501 --> 02:35:29.262]  No, you're right.
[02:35:29.262 --> 02:35:31.563]  She gets sucked into it as much as anybody does.
[02:35:31.563 --> 02:35:35.725]  It's like when you had Jack Dorsey on, he goes, we have laboratories that are testing all this.
[02:35:35.725 --> 02:35:41.929]  So if you go back to that steak dinner by your office that we had three weeks ago, because in like six, seven minutes, you laid it all out about,
[02:35:42.549 --> 02:35:49.954]  You know, we need to create a real debate and say to them, look, you don't, murderers don't get banned from something for life unless it's premeditated.
[02:35:49.954 --> 02:35:51.615]  You can't do this to people.
[02:35:51.615 --> 02:35:54.697]  This is going to cause a societal crisis, which I don't want to have.
[02:35:54.697 --> 02:35:56.258]  I'm not even begging to get back on their platforms.
[02:35:56.258 --> 02:35:57.619]  I have my platforms.
[02:35:57.619 --> 02:36:00.340]  It's just that I can see that it's super dangerous.
[02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:02.262]  And now they're banning people's books.
[02:36:02.262 --> 02:36:04.163]  And now they're, you know, now Amazon's doing it.
[02:36:04.163 --> 02:36:08.686]  So can you, in your own words, because it was really powerful, that big idea about a
[02:36:09.226 --> 02:36:17.532]  A road, not even so much to redemption, but a road for big tech to admit it's been out of control in a way to bring people back on.
[02:36:17.532 --> 02:36:32.243]  There has to be a place that is like Twitter, that is the number one environment for global communication, where both people on the right and the left can feel free to express their ideologies.
[02:36:32.623 --> 02:36:37.024]  Feel free, and have a place where they can debate back and forth.
[02:36:37.024 --> 02:36:54.308]  As soon as one side controls the narrative, as soon as you have the people on the left that are silencing the people on the right, and you know, this is one of the things that came up during the podcast with Vijja and Jack Dorsey, where Tim Poole was saying that by saying, deadnaming someone, or misgendering someone, you can get banned for life.
[02:36:54.308 --> 02:37:00.089]  Like you're saying to a person, perhaps maybe that someone has very distinct religious beliefs,
[02:37:00.489 --> 02:37:05.470]  Where they don't believe that someone is capable of transitioning from a man to a woman.
[02:37:05.470 --> 02:37:07.291]  And there's no judge, there's no jury.
[02:37:07.291 --> 02:37:08.291]  You never get arrested.
[02:37:08.291 --> 02:37:08.791]  You're just banned.
[02:37:08.791 --> 02:37:09.851]  You're just banned.
[02:37:09.851 --> 02:37:12.132]  And it's based on their ideology.
[02:37:12.132 --> 02:37:17.393]  It's not based on rules that our society agrees upon.
[02:37:17.393 --> 02:37:20.254]  Because the rules of free speech, they're pretty clear.
[02:37:20.254 --> 02:37:23.794]  Like, in the rules of free speech, you could call someone whatever you want.
[02:37:23.794 --> 02:37:25.075]  Like, that's free speech.
[02:37:25.075 --> 02:37:25.895]  As long as you're not
[02:37:26.275 --> 02:37:28.716]  Alright, so the interview gets better and better.
[02:37:28.716 --> 02:37:33.077]  The full interview is posted to Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:37:33.077 --> 02:37:37.498]  Now, a lot of people say, okay, yeah, Joe's saying free speech exists, that's a good thing.
[02:37:37.498 --> 02:37:48.400]  But he's doing it on a platform where he's very popular with leftists and liberals, not just conservatives and hunters and fitness enthusiasts and UFC fans.
[02:37:49.622 --> 02:37:54.105]  So him doing this takes a lot of courage and that's why I really feel good about what Joe's done.
[02:37:54.105 --> 02:38:01.351]  I went way too far in attacking him but once I do start attacking friends I tend to go overboard because I don't normally do that.
[02:38:01.351 --> 02:38:06.695]  So I have to get in an emotional state just to do it then it becomes a snowball.
[02:38:06.695 --> 02:38:16.283]  But you know now in hindsight some of the things I did were over the top so I apologize to Joe for that but as Barry Goldwater said
[02:38:17.267 --> 02:38:25.930]  Defense, radical defense of liberty, extremism and defense of liberty is no vice.
[02:38:25.930 --> 02:38:29.491]  Now let me shift gears into several clips I've got here.
[02:38:29.491 --> 02:38:45.496]  One is Nadler, one of the Democratic leaders, obviously in the House, spewing a bunch of bull on a New York street corner talking to the so-called news, and people are walking by saying, you're a loser, you're full of it, you're an idiot, you're trying to hold America back.
[02:38:47.597 --> 02:38:56.326]  There's another clip of Trump will play first, but Netanyahu just about an hour ago saying he hopes this doesn't happen to future presidents.
[02:38:56.326 --> 02:39:03.193]  Well, that's why, Mr. President, you have to go after the crimes that were committed here.
[02:39:03.193 --> 02:39:04.375]  That's why you have to go after
[02:39:06.215 --> 02:39:13.259]  Comey and the Clintons and especially McCabe, who you've got red-handed.
[02:39:13.259 --> 02:39:18.683]  Strzok and Lisa Page creating a fake investigation to try to remove you from office.
[02:39:18.683 --> 02:39:20.083]  That's called a coup.
[02:39:20.083 --> 02:39:22.205]  It's called illegal takedown.
[02:39:22.205 --> 02:39:23.425]  It's exactly what you called it.
[02:39:23.425 --> 02:39:26.367]  So, here's the deal.
[02:39:26.367 --> 02:39:30.790]  These criminals aren't going to respect you unless you start going after some of them.
[02:39:30.790 --> 02:39:32.291]  Plus, are you going to sleep good at night?
[02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:37.782]  Were these individuals just getting away with this?
[02:39:37.782 --> 02:39:39.944]  This is the boldest thing in modern world history.
[02:39:39.944 --> 02:39:42.686]  It's definitely the boldest thing in most of U.S.
[02:39:42.686 --> 02:39:43.526]  history.
[02:39:43.526 --> 02:39:45.288]  Stuff like this has not been pulled.
[02:39:45.288 --> 02:39:46.608]  This is very rare.
[02:39:46.608 --> 02:39:47.409]  Very dangerous.
[02:39:47.409 --> 02:40:02.880]  And I'd sleep a lot better at night if the Clintons were behind bars and Comey got indicted and something happened to these crooks to bust open the full story of what they're doing inside.
[02:40:04.107 --> 02:40:05.949]  And that's what we need.
[02:40:05.949 --> 02:40:12.437]  I've been fighting these folks hard to try to get us to the point of lock her up and now we're almost there and we need to complete this.
[02:40:14.633 --> 02:40:21.458]  You know, there's some monster that comes to the woods at night and occasionally, you know, a couple times a year tries to tear the back door off your house and eat your kids.
[02:40:21.458 --> 02:40:27.642]  And you catch the monster doing it and grab a machete and hack one of its arms off, but it runs off into the night.
[02:40:27.642 --> 02:40:34.507]  But if you follow the blood trail of the cave it lives in, you want to go in there and make sure it's been dispatched completely politically through the courts.
[02:40:34.507 --> 02:40:41.332]  I don't mean literally hack up Hillary with a machete, but I'm saying Grindle got his arm torn off and he's gone into that nest.
[02:40:42.333 --> 02:40:45.095]  And we think he's still alive in there.
[02:40:45.095 --> 02:40:46.857]  In this case, we know they are.
[02:40:46.857 --> 02:40:48.958]  There's a lot of stuff going on in that cave.
[02:40:48.958 --> 02:40:50.099]  Who knows how bad it is?
[02:40:50.099 --> 02:40:55.784]  We need to go in the cave, light the torches, and go in.
[02:40:55.784 --> 02:40:59.067]  And I've already, believe me, I've already been going to these caves for a long time.
[02:40:59.067 --> 02:41:00.748]  I've found a lot of nasty stuff.
[02:41:00.748 --> 02:41:05.372]  And our children aren't safe unless we finish the job.
[02:41:05.372 --> 02:41:08.854]  Because Grendel's got a mama.
[02:41:08.854 --> 02:41:10.576]  And mama is gonna pull some stuff.
[02:41:12.008 --> 02:41:16.051]  So I suggest we go ahead and go face mama and just get this over with.
[02:41:16.051 --> 02:41:17.933]  There's always going to be problems, always going to be enemies.
[02:41:17.933 --> 02:41:20.215]  Well, anyways, here's the president.
[02:41:20.215 --> 02:41:22.457]  I will tell you, I love this country.
[02:41:22.457 --> 02:41:25.799]  I love this country as much as I can love anything.
[02:41:25.799 --> 02:41:28.662]  My family, my country, my God.
[02:41:28.662 --> 02:41:32.725]  But what they did, it was a false narrative.
[02:41:32.725 --> 02:41:35.908]  It was a terrible thing.
[02:41:35.908 --> 02:41:38.970]  We can never let this happen to another president again.
[02:41:38.970 --> 02:41:39.851]  I can tell you that.
[02:41:39.851 --> 02:41:40.872]  I say it very strongly.
[02:41:42.587 --> 02:41:45.449]  Very few people I know could have handled it.
[02:41:45.449 --> 02:41:51.113]  We can never, ever let this happen to another president again.
[02:41:51.113 --> 02:41:53.275]  And what about what Tucker Carlson said?
[02:41:53.275 --> 02:42:01.421]  When Roger Stone, no Russia collusion, no Russia him, they claim he lied to Congress, saying he directly talked to WikiLeaks when he never did say that.
[02:42:01.421 --> 02:42:04.143]  So, yeah, of course pardon him.
[02:42:04.143 --> 02:42:06.365]  Then I got called a Russian agent.
[02:42:06.365 --> 02:42:07.986]  Paul Watson got called a Russian agent.
[02:42:09.417 --> 02:42:10.158]  They turned U.S.
[02:42:10.158 --> 02:42:16.403]  intelligence agencies loose on us and have torn the living hell out of the First Amendment.
[02:42:16.403 --> 02:42:20.727]  And yeah, we're still in the fight.
[02:42:20.727 --> 02:42:22.929]  But this isn't over.
[02:42:22.929 --> 02:42:24.351]  Google's censoring the hell out of everybody?
[02:42:24.351 --> 02:42:27.794]  Yeah, Donald Trump's just tweeted this.
[02:42:27.794 --> 02:42:33.839]  If Roger Stone was indicted for lying to Congress, what about lying done by Comey, Brennan, Clapper, all of them?
[02:42:33.839 --> 02:42:34.500]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:34.500 --> 02:42:35.701]  I'm going to play the Nadler clip.
[02:42:36.894 --> 02:42:38.496]  And I'm going to play a couple other clips.
[02:42:38.496 --> 02:42:39.757]  Paul Watson's got a new report out.
[02:42:39.757 --> 02:42:47.024]  And then, coming up, we've got one of my favorite talk show hosts, Will Johnson, loaded for bear.
[02:42:47.024 --> 02:42:47.644]  Stay with us.
[02:42:47.644 --> 02:42:48.445]  Infowars.com.
[02:42:48.445 --> 02:42:50.187]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:42:50.187 --> 02:42:52.129]  And whatever you do, share those links.
[02:42:52.129 --> 02:42:52.749]  Newswars.com.
[02:42:55.137 --> 02:42:57.099]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:42:57.099 --> 02:42:57.819]  Go ahead.
[02:42:57.819 --> 02:43:00.081]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:00.081 --> 02:43:03.885]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:03.885 --> 02:43:05.326]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:05.326 --> 02:43:07.728]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:07.728 --> 02:43:10.070]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:10.070 --> 02:43:14.073]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:14.073 --> 02:43:16.516]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:17.376 --> 02:43:20.058]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:20.058 --> 02:43:21.399]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:43:21.399 --> 02:43:22.519]  Us being shut down?
[02:43:22.519 --> 02:43:24.000]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:25.081]  You know what, Alex?
[02:43:25.081 --> 02:43:26.182]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[02:43:26.182 --> 02:43:27.282]  Hey, Frank!

[02:46:58.616 --> 02:47:01.678]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:01.678 --> 02:47:15.567]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:24.375 --> 02:47:28.179]  Well, you heard a few hours ago that Michael Avenatti was indicted.
[02:47:28.179 --> 02:47:28.899]  Now he's been arrested.
[02:47:28.899 --> 02:47:31.362]  I'll tell you about that in a moment.
[02:47:31.362 --> 02:47:33.303]  Daryl listens to his transparency.
[02:47:33.303 --> 02:47:39.069]  Trump is a model of cooperation compared to Obama's stonewalling and delay and arresting reporters.
[02:47:39.069 --> 02:47:40.050]  Remember that?
[02:47:40.050 --> 02:47:40.690]  War on the press?
[02:47:41.954 --> 02:47:44.316]  I know, when you have a memory, stuff's just crazy.
[02:47:44.316 --> 02:47:49.841]  But the left really believes Trump's arresting all these reporters and a Nazi.
[02:47:49.841 --> 02:47:52.504]  I'm sorry.
[02:47:52.504 --> 02:47:55.246]  Austin is the world capital of allergies.
[02:47:55.246 --> 02:48:05.015]  It's recognized around the world as having the highest concentrations of pollen of anywhere except, strangely enough, you'd think it's like the Amazon.
[02:48:05.015 --> 02:48:06.196]  No?
[02:48:06.196 --> 02:48:07.357]  Knoxville, Tennessee.
[02:48:09.321 --> 02:48:14.124]  Has a lot of different plants and flora and fauna.
[02:48:14.124 --> 02:48:16.265]  So I grew up in Dallas.
[02:48:16.265 --> 02:48:19.287]  And it was mainly grassy plains up there.
[02:48:19.287 --> 02:48:21.829]  And I had friends that wouldn't want to go out and play baseball.
[02:48:21.829 --> 02:48:26.452]  They wouldn't want to go ride motorcycles, you know.
[02:48:26.452 --> 02:48:27.212]  Dirt bikes.
[02:48:27.212 --> 02:48:28.493]  They'd say, I got allergies.
[02:48:28.493 --> 02:48:32.896]  I thought that was a hypochondriac thing.
[02:48:32.896 --> 02:48:37.139]  Or we're playing football and kids noses were running and I'm like, you know, eighth grade, like, what are you a wimp?
[02:48:38.271 --> 02:48:45.733]  Cause I got sick like every five years or something, you know, the flu.
[02:48:45.733 --> 02:48:47.973]  And then I moved to Austin about two years into living here.
[02:48:47.973 --> 02:48:53.175]  I did a couple of years of high school here, a couple in Dallas.
[02:48:53.175 --> 02:48:55.935]  I was like, mom, I've been sick for two weeks.
[02:48:55.935 --> 02:48:56.876]  I just feel like I'm sick.
[02:48:56.876 --> 02:48:58.856]  She goes, yeah, you got cedar fever.
[02:48:58.856 --> 02:49:01.157]  Cedar's out right now.
[02:49:01.157 --> 02:49:02.217]  It's really a mountain juniper.
[02:49:03.504 --> 02:49:08.168]  So, that happens a couple times a year, then I get over it, and then I forget Oak hits at this time.
[02:49:08.168 --> 02:49:13.853]  So, you saw me earlier, had to go back to the Joe Rogan interview, even though I wasn't going to play at that point, because I couldn't talk.
[02:49:13.853 --> 02:49:16.134]  I was coughing and I didn't have a drink.
[02:49:16.134 --> 02:49:27.664]  And Daria walks in and talks about, really, the sleeper product here, that I never talk about, that I never promote, that doesn't make you feel like you're high, like Clarendon Dee or Zyrtec.
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:34.583]  Those will knock out your Cedar Fever, your stuff in my experience, but also makes you feel like hell.
[02:49:34.583 --> 02:49:41.608]  Pollen Blot is from a special type of quail eggs, and it's patented.
[02:49:41.608 --> 02:49:44.210]  All we do is search what's the best selling, highest rated.
[02:49:44.210 --> 02:49:46.691]  But it's not popular here in the U.S.
[02:49:46.691 --> 02:49:48.413]  This is in Europe's popular.
[02:49:48.413 --> 02:49:51.034]  So we private label the highest quality here in the U.S.
[02:49:51.034 --> 02:49:52.195]  It's got a new bottle.
[02:49:52.195 --> 02:49:53.176]  The bottle was red, I said.
[02:49:54.718 --> 02:49:55.398]  I don't think so.
[02:50:13.746 --> 02:50:18.370]  But in my experience, a couple days into taking it, why I forget to take it, I'm crazy.
[02:50:18.370 --> 02:50:20.832]  One reason was it was sold out for months, and the bottle I had at home was gone.
[02:50:20.832 --> 02:50:22.433]  So I'm gonna stockpile this.
[02:50:22.433 --> 02:50:32.021]  Supposed to take two of these babies, and look at me, TV viewers, you chew these up, and they hit within 30 minutes.
[02:50:32.021 --> 02:50:34.083]  And they don't taste bad either.
[02:50:34.083 --> 02:50:38.347]  How sweet.
[02:50:38.347 --> 02:50:40.969]  No additives, no preservatives, no nothing.
[02:50:43.612 --> 02:50:55.360]  These special quail, they learned that people that live in these areas of France, and who ate these quail eggs, because the French eat a lot of quail eggs, a lot of quail period, didn't get allergies.
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:50:57.742]  It's happened back in the 50s.
[02:50:57.742 --> 02:51:01.564]  And they've learned too, people try to breed these certain type of quail, other places it doesn't work.
[02:51:01.564 --> 02:51:11.071]  It's got to be from France, and they're just immersed in pollen and dust, and these birds, the seeds they eat, their body just knows how to deal with it.
[02:51:11.071 --> 02:51:11.812]  And somehow then,
[02:51:12.844 --> 02:51:21.707]  Whatever the protein is in the egg shell is transferred to you, and it's amazing.
[02:51:21.707 --> 02:51:25.509]  Pollen Baroque from InfoWars Life, and it gets into what it does.
[02:51:25.509 --> 02:51:37.153]  Helps support sinus function, helps enhance respiratory function, promotes clear airway passage and normal breathing, promotes respiratory health and normal breathing, supports eye comfort and sinus health.
[02:51:37.153 --> 02:51:40.294]  Powerful ingredients inside include your bottle of
[02:51:42.611 --> 02:51:48.816]  Life immune wall include quail egg concentrate.
[02:51:48.816 --> 02:52:00.105]  In decades ago, researchers in France discovered the ability of certain quail eggs to alleviate seasonal related symptoms when eaten and sorbitol tooth friendly low calorie sugar.
[02:52:00.105 --> 02:52:03.647]  Then it just goes on from there.
[02:52:03.647 --> 02:52:04.188]  Get your
[02:52:06.072 --> 02:52:07.552]  Pollen.
[02:52:07.552 --> 02:52:08.293]  Block.
[02:52:08.293 --> 02:52:09.373]  Today.
[02:52:09.373 --> 02:52:12.694]  And I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
[02:52:12.694 --> 02:52:16.374]  4.7 stars, 94% reviews.
[02:52:16.374 --> 02:52:21.096]  And I'm told it works basically for everybody, but you've got experience of yourself.
[02:52:21.096 --> 02:52:22.156]  Why not try it?
[02:52:22.156 --> 02:52:24.016]  You're supporting the broadcast, so you really can't lose.
[02:52:24.016 --> 02:52:28.197]  I said I'm gonna get to Paul's report.
[02:52:28.197 --> 02:52:29.938]  So Will Johnson will be okay.
[02:52:29.938 --> 02:52:30.438]  I'm going to
[02:52:32.523 --> 02:52:37.206]  Go ahead and do part of the second segment so I can get Paul's report out, and then Will Johnson will take over.
[02:52:37.206 --> 02:52:41.508]  So we'll start the second segment with Paul Joseph Watson's The Truth About Russia Collusion.
[02:52:41.508 --> 02:52:44.690]  It's very powerful.
[02:52:44.690 --> 02:52:45.630]  And a lot more.
[02:52:45.630 --> 02:52:50.773]  But let's go ahead and go to Congressman Nadler.
[02:52:50.773 --> 02:53:00.178]  And this needs to happen when the Democrats go out to their constituents, when they go to balls, when they go to events, when they're on local radio you should call in, when they're out in the public.
[02:53:00.178 --> 02:53:00.938]  Don't be vicious.
[02:53:00.938 --> 02:53:01.539]  Don't be hateful.
[02:53:02.315 --> 02:53:05.437]  Let's just Bill Clinton, you know, say, hey, you're a rapist.
[02:53:05.437 --> 02:53:07.038]  But just point out what scum they are.
[02:53:07.038 --> 02:53:13.743]  Because they're telling Antifa to go out and run us out of restaurants, and run us out of grocery stores, and run us out of gas stations.
[02:53:13.743 --> 02:53:16.465]  No, don't run them out of places.
[02:53:16.465 --> 02:53:22.189]  And if they're with their family, leave them alone when they're eating dinner with their family.
[02:53:22.189 --> 02:53:29.794]  But, they get up by themselves to leave, or they're going outside, go over and tell them, hey, I don't like what you're doing, I don't appreciate it, we see through you.
[02:53:31.260 --> 02:53:32.461]  That's it.
[02:53:32.461 --> 02:53:34.442]  We're not going to lower ourselves their level.
[02:53:34.442 --> 02:53:35.482]  We're going to do stuff like this.
[02:53:35.482 --> 02:53:37.303]  So here's Nadler.
[02:53:37.303 --> 02:53:41.425]  We try to exercise executive privilege, but it won't be successful.
[02:53:41.425 --> 02:53:45.367]  Executive privilege must be asserted by the president personally.
[02:53:45.367 --> 02:53:52.171]  And as the Nixon case in front of the Supreme Court, which was decided 9 to nothing, pointed out,
[02:53:56.934 --> 02:54:02.259]  Executive privilege cannot be used to shield or hide wrongdoing.
[02:54:02.259 --> 02:54:12.247]  In the case of Nixon, the tapes of his personal conversations with people were ordered revealed by the court, so I don't think that executive privilege will be very successful defense here.
[02:54:12.247 --> 02:54:14.949]  Mr. Chairman, ABC News.
[02:54:14.949 --> 02:54:22.576]  The Speaker and Leader Schumer are tonight questioning what they say is the Attorney General's bias.
[02:54:22.576 --> 02:54:25.078]  Is that fair and do you have confidence in the Attorney General?
[02:54:25.498 --> 02:54:26.819]  Well, it is fair.
[02:54:26.819 --> 02:54:31.420]  In fact, I questioned it if you listen to what I said.
[02:54:31.420 --> 02:54:38.043]  So there he is, continuing to act like Trump's guilty of something when there's nothing there.
[02:54:38.043 --> 02:54:42.264]  And then they criminally surveilled him during the campaign, when he was president-elect.
[02:54:42.264 --> 02:54:44.625]  When he was president, they got caught lying about it.
[02:54:44.625 --> 02:54:46.446]  And they committed all these crimes.
[02:54:46.446 --> 02:54:51.628]  We must go on the offense, or they're going to continue to pull the criminal actions.
[02:54:53.294 --> 02:54:54.274]  It's incredible.
[02:54:54.274 --> 02:54:55.815]  And we must stop Google.
[02:54:55.815 --> 02:54:59.576]  It's openly, according to top computer scientists, that they've published the results.
[02:54:59.576 --> 02:55:00.996]  We can all see it ourselves.
[02:55:00.996 --> 02:55:03.337]  Not even showing you conservative candidates.
[02:55:03.337 --> 02:55:04.637]  Showing you lies.
[02:55:04.637 --> 02:55:07.838]  Saying all the Republicans in key states are Nazis.
[02:55:07.838 --> 02:55:09.859]  It says party affiliation.
[02:55:09.859 --> 02:55:14.180]  Nazi party.
[02:55:14.180 --> 02:55:17.721]  It's crazy.
[02:55:17.721 --> 02:55:21.302]  And then Google gets caught helping build weapons systems for China.
[02:55:25.114 --> 02:55:27.396]  By the way, I forgot the key point getting into Pollen Block.
[02:55:27.396 --> 02:55:33.002]  I was telling you why Dari came in and said, take your Pollen Block.
[02:55:34.369 --> 02:55:41.152]  I forget with allergies, because I won't take Claritin, and I won't take these other things because it makes me a speed freak and makes me rude.
[02:55:41.152 --> 02:55:54.259]  A few times I have anger issues, it's when I go bad, I got horrible allergies, let me take a Claritin, let me take a... And this is not a drug, this is what Mother Nature gave you, these quail eggs that eat these certain diets, that have something secreted that's an antihistamine, that nature gave us.
[02:55:54.259 --> 02:55:58.761]  It's like tumerics, this great anti-inflammatory God gave us, with our bodies.
[02:55:58.761 --> 02:56:00.983]  But my point is, I'm just like you,
[02:56:02.091 --> 02:56:11.560]  I forget, because we sold out of it, and we didn't have it, and that I didn't have it for during the allergies, that I should have stockpiled it.
[02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:17.565]  I don't think I made that point that, oh yeah, I've got something I can take for this that actually works for me.
[02:56:18.342 --> 02:56:20.484]  That was the point I wanted to add about Pollen Block.
[02:56:20.484 --> 02:56:27.249]  Store-wide free shipping, 50% off all supplements, including Pollen Block, except for some of the bestsellers, which we're going to have to end.
[02:56:27.249 --> 02:56:32.514]  We already had to end the protein bars and Turbo Force, because those have basically sold out.
[02:56:32.514 --> 02:56:35.436]  They've gone back to regular price, because more doesn't come in for at least a month.
[02:56:35.436 --> 02:56:37.357]  But Brain Force Plus, amazing nootropic.
[02:56:38.078 --> 02:56:40.179]  For the brain, focus, you name it.
[02:56:40.179 --> 02:56:42.399]  Clarity, 60% off, folks love it.
[02:56:42.399 --> 02:56:43.339]  That's at cost.

[02:56:59.004 --> 02:57:00.144]  You cannot beat those deals.
[02:57:01.761 --> 02:57:04.903]  And get a t-shirt while you're there, because that's how you meet like-minded people.
[02:57:04.903 --> 02:57:07.584]  Sure, you don't need to wear a big M4 shirt in a leftist area.
[02:57:07.584 --> 02:57:08.565]  I don't recommend it.
[02:57:08.565 --> 02:57:10.646]  They don't care if you have kids with you, they'll attack.
[02:57:10.646 --> 02:57:13.468]  They'll throw things in your face, they'll rob you, they'll spit on you.
[02:57:13.468 --> 02:57:16.169]  A lot of times they'll go, I love Satan, and run off.
[02:57:16.169 --> 02:57:16.850]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[02:57:16.850 --> 02:57:19.111]  It's like mass demon possession.
[02:57:19.111 --> 02:57:21.673]  But if you're wearing a Moabé, leftists don't speak Latin.
[02:57:21.673 --> 02:57:22.313]  They don't know what it means.
[02:57:22.313 --> 02:57:25.455]  You know, come and take it.
[02:57:26.642 --> 02:57:31.687]  A Molon Labe, a News Wars, a Space Force shirt.
[02:57:31.687 --> 02:57:33.588]  All those are awesome.
[02:57:33.588 --> 02:57:37.031]  And they help you spread the word and meet line-of-finding people in forestry.com.
[02:57:37.031 --> 02:57:42.737]  Okay, I'm gonna come back with a Paul Joseph Watson report and some other news on Avenatti's now been arrested.

[02:58:46.312 --> 02:58:46.752]  I think so.
[02:59:00.666 --> 02:59:09.809]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[02:59:09.809 --> 02:59:15.170]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.

[02:59:49.618 --> 02:59:52.279]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.441 --> 03:00:31.817]  It's mind control Corruption of your thoughts Destruction of your soul Don't let them hold your mind They wanna control mankind Seems like their only intention Is to exploit the earth And you trust them
[03:00:37.060 --> 03:00:39.542]  Folks, we're back live here and I was just googling my name.
[03:00:39.542 --> 03:00:48.528]  I was just checking stuff out here and I noticed Media Matters has put out their latest BS spin.
[03:00:48.528 --> 03:00:50.529]  You just document cam shot here if you need to.
[03:00:50.529 --> 03:00:57.254]  Alex Jones reacts to Miller Report summary by expressing his willingness to execute traitors.
[03:00:57.254 --> 03:00:59.936]  Then they go on to claim that I'm talking about Rachel Maddow.
[03:01:00.968 --> 03:01:02.569]  None of that is true.
[03:01:02.569 --> 03:01:04.831]  That is all more garbage.
[03:01:04.831 --> 03:01:15.939]  What happens is, we got a great crew in here, but we don't script everything like an hour-long CNN show where every graphic that goes up is exactly what we mean to show or whatever.
[03:01:15.939 --> 03:01:18.821]  Everybody's seen mainstream news put the wrong graphics up.
[03:01:18.821 --> 03:01:29.709]  I was talking about how Jeff Bezos, who I'm always critical of for a lot of reasons, never sold us out to China, never helped round up political dissidents, never ran slave factories.
[03:01:31.332 --> 03:01:34.036]  As bad as some of their problems are.
[03:01:34.036 --> 03:01:37.640]  And how I'm sick of being called a traitor.
[03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:39.803]  Because traitors get executed.
[03:01:39.803 --> 03:01:43.307]  And I said it's not my department that people ever found guilty of treason.
[03:01:44.366 --> 03:01:51.851]  To execute folks, but that, you know, if we found heads of American companies were actually Chinese agents, I'd kick the levers all day.
[03:01:51.851 --> 03:01:55.013]  And somebody in there, because it's, you know, and I'm not mad at them.
[03:01:55.013 --> 03:01:55.974]  It's the way the show works.
[03:01:55.974 --> 03:01:58.996]  I can have it where I have to prove a graphic, was surfing through, they're punching buttons.
[03:01:58.996 --> 03:02:02.999]  You see it all the time where a pop-up pops up or there's the wrong picture and they move it.
[03:02:02.999 --> 03:02:04.360]  It's part of the fun of live TV.
[03:02:05.020 --> 03:02:10.662]  Rachel Maddow pops up, because we've just been talking about Rachel Maddow, crying over Russiagate.
[03:02:10.662 --> 03:02:13.123]  So they got all these channels, all these computer screens open.
[03:02:13.123 --> 03:02:14.344]  Somebody punched that up.
[03:02:14.344 --> 03:02:21.767]  So during me talking about traitors at Google, Maddow pops up, and that turns into, I want to hang Rachel Maddow.
[03:02:21.767 --> 03:02:24.848]  No, I don't wish any harm upon Rachel Maddow.
[03:02:24.848 --> 03:02:26.509]  And Media Matters knows that.
[03:02:28.835 --> 03:02:33.016]  It just absolutely never ends with these people and how deceptive they are.
[03:02:33.016 --> 03:02:36.097]  But that's what they do.
[03:02:36.097 --> 03:02:38.618]  That's who they are.
[03:02:38.618 --> 03:02:44.360]  And people know that's who they are.
[03:02:44.360 --> 03:02:46.821]  And you read the Media Matters comments, people are like, how are you going?
[03:02:46.821 --> 03:02:47.901]  You like being deplatformed?
[03:02:47.901 --> 03:02:49.422]  You like being shut down?
[03:02:49.422 --> 03:02:51.683]  It's all coming out what's happened.
[03:02:51.683 --> 03:02:52.923]  You're getting in trouble.
[03:02:52.923 --> 03:02:54.043]  You're losing.
[03:02:54.043 --> 03:02:55.644]  Your corrupt lawyers are going to jail.
[03:02:57.142 --> 03:03:03.405]  The deplatforming of InfoWars in a sick way because of our listeners standing firm and taking action got bigger.
[03:03:03.405 --> 03:03:06.866]  I'm more mobbed on the street positively than ever before.
[03:03:06.866 --> 03:03:17.031]  I went into a cafe at 1030 in the morning to have a late breakfast brunch with my wife and my oldest daughter, and no one was in there.
[03:03:17.031 --> 03:03:26.395]  But just through the window, people saw me and 10-year-old kids and 7-year-old kids with their parents came in and wanted autographs.
[03:03:27.793 --> 03:03:31.676]  And when I walked outside, people wanted to shake my hand.
[03:03:31.676 --> 03:03:33.097]  It's not working.
[03:03:33.097 --> 03:03:35.478]  But with the left, they don't care.
[03:03:35.478 --> 03:03:40.682]  They want the simulation in their mind that we've been defeated.
[03:03:40.682 --> 03:03:48.827]  And they believe in their own echo bubble world, that if they lie about me and lie about what I've said about Sandy Hook and things, that it has this big effect.
[03:03:48.827 --> 03:03:54.791]  Only with NPR and CNN viewers, who are already believing everything you tell them.
[03:03:54.791 --> 03:03:56.072]  They believe I'm a Russian agent.
[03:03:56.072 --> 03:03:56.933]  They believe all this crap.
[03:03:58.973 --> 03:03:59.974]  So it's incredible.
[03:03:59.974 --> 03:04:02.075]  It's not working anymore.
[03:04:02.075 --> 03:04:06.058]  I don't believe in any offensive violence.
[03:04:06.058 --> 03:04:10.802]  They had the Pentagon, the FBI, and the CIA investigate me as a traitor.
[03:04:10.802 --> 03:04:13.484]  Punishable by execution.
[03:04:13.484 --> 03:04:20.169]  And I said Google and Apple are working in China to engage in high treason.
[03:04:20.169 --> 03:04:22.171]  And that they need to be charged.
[03:04:23.126 --> 03:04:24.306]  That they need to be indicted.
[03:04:24.306 --> 03:04:26.467]  They need to be brought to justice.
[03:04:26.467 --> 03:04:28.927]  And you turn that into Rachel Maddow.
[03:04:28.927 --> 03:04:30.687]  Good try.
[03:04:30.687 --> 03:04:33.448]  Has nothing to do with Rachel Maddow.
[03:04:33.448 --> 03:04:34.948]  Remember when they popped her up for a minute?
[03:04:34.948 --> 03:04:37.068]  I just don't want to sound like I'm bashing on the crew.
[03:04:37.068 --> 03:04:38.489]  I'm not talking about Rachel Maddow.
[03:04:38.489 --> 03:04:41.389]  I'm talking about anybody found guilty of treason.
[03:04:41.389 --> 03:04:43.210]  She's just guilty of being a propagandist.
[03:04:43.210 --> 03:04:44.090]  But I didn't do it!
[03:04:44.090 --> 03:04:47.190]  But from now on, when my gut tells me, I'm gonna do it.
[03:04:47.190 --> 03:04:50.251]  Because hey, the crew's great, but they... Stuff like that happens.
[03:04:50.251 --> 03:04:51.151]  And you got 20 channels up.
[03:04:54.063 --> 03:04:58.708]  The globalists, the eugenicists are always talking down to us.
[03:04:58.708 --> 03:05:02.951]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[03:05:02.951 --> 03:05:10.899]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[03:05:10.899 --> 03:05:14.022]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[03:05:14.022 --> 03:05:17.505]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[03:05:21.933 --> 03:05:23.995]  We are the power structure.
[03:05:23.995 --> 03:05:25.597]  We are the inventors.
[03:05:25.597 --> 03:05:27.379]  We are the trailblazers.
[03:05:27.379 --> 03:05:30.782]  And the globalists understand that.
[03:05:30.782 --> 03:05:36.708]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people.
[03:05:37.876 --> 03:05:53.204]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists, I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at importrestore.com, something everybody should take advantage of.
[03:06:00.809 --> 03:06:02.470]  We're on the march.
[03:06:02.470 --> 03:06:04.332]  The empire's on the run.
[03:06:04.332 --> 03:06:06.453]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:06:06.453 --> 03:06:08.375]  Will Johnson is about to take over.
[03:06:08.375 --> 03:06:13.299]  Very informed and dynamic individual.
[03:06:13.299 --> 03:06:14.780]  The left is not going to give up.
[03:06:14.780 --> 03:06:16.821]  They're going to get more shrill, more criminal.
[03:06:16.821 --> 03:06:18.963]  They're going to stage more Jesse Smollett things.
[03:06:18.963 --> 03:06:20.684]  They're going to take more things out of context.
[03:06:20.684 --> 03:06:23.886]  They're going to try to censor more, brigade more, harass more.
[03:06:23.886 --> 03:06:29.150]  But we have reports now that have gone live on Infowars.com
[03:06:30.580 --> 03:06:42.689]  With top computer scientists proving Google stole the 2018 elections and live time video where we prove Google and YouTube are fixing search results.
[03:06:42.689 --> 03:06:45.231]  This is incredible and anybody can duplicate it themselves.
[03:06:46.291 --> 03:06:47.212]  It's very important.
[03:06:47.212 --> 03:06:48.272]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:06:48.272 --> 03:06:50.374]  Will Johnson is about to take over.
[03:06:50.374 --> 03:06:55.637]  Please don't forget, we're Lister Supported, free shipping store-wide, 50 to 60% off.
[03:06:55.637 --> 03:06:56.838]  This is our biggest sell ever.
[03:06:56.838 --> 03:06:58.499]  It even tops Christmas.
[03:06:58.499 --> 03:07:00.940]  I guess they decided to have some out of these 60% off.
[03:07:00.940 --> 03:07:02.261]  And this is how we fund our operations.
[03:07:02.261 --> 03:07:04.202]  So stock up on high-quality coffee.
[03:07:04.202 --> 03:07:08.605]  Stock up on high-quality, fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified toothpaste.
[03:07:08.605 --> 03:07:10.006]  Stock up on fish oil.
[03:07:10.006 --> 03:07:11.286]  Stock up on turmeric.
[03:07:11.286 --> 03:07:13.328]  Stock up on things you're going to need each month.
[03:07:14.198 --> 03:07:20.739]  I can say stock up on the energy bars, the protein bars, all that, but they've sold out or about to as we went back to regular price.
[03:07:20.739 --> 03:07:28.181]  Infowarsstore.com, and thank you all for standing with us, and thank you, by the way, to this great crew and the amazing job that they do as well.
[03:07:28.181 --> 03:07:32.962]  The War Room is coming up in T-minus 53 minutes with Owen Schroyer.
[03:07:32.962 --> 03:07:37.543]  His co-host is Roger Stone, but he's a political prisoner, so he can't come on right now.
[03:07:37.543 --> 03:07:40.444]  There's been a lot of other insane developments today, obviously.
[03:07:41.553 --> 03:07:51.524]  Man, we're trying to gauge what's happening there and deal with it, but we're in the thick of the fight for this country, but we're... We're in sudden death over time with the globalists.
[03:07:51.524 --> 03:07:52.505]  Toe to toe.
[03:07:52.505 --> 03:07:57.190]  But we have the initiative, and we're driving down the field, and they don't know what to do.
[03:07:57.190 --> 03:08:01.114]  It's like a 99-yard drive, and we're 10 yards from the end zone right now.
[03:08:07.475 --> 03:08:11.879]  You can feel the energy, and the enemy had such horrible plans for all of us.
[03:08:11.879 --> 03:08:18.586]  They love to bully kids, they love to target the unborn, now the born, but everything slips into their hands right now and they don't know what to do.
[03:08:18.586 --> 03:08:25.033]  The inferiority complex of the evil ones, they just are beside themselves because they were finally about to rule Earth.
[03:08:25.033 --> 03:08:28.336]  Let's go ahead and go to Paul Watson's report, then Will Johnson.
[03:08:29.591 --> 03:08:43.670]  So the same media that relentlessly calls me a fake news conspiracy theorist just spent the last two years pushing what turned out to be the biggest fake news conspiracy theory since Saddam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction.
[03:08:43.670 --> 03:08:44.531]  Who's the conspiracy theorist?
[03:08:44.531 --> 03:08:46.092]  You're a se-theorist now!
[03:08:46.092 --> 03:08:51.617]  As Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi writes, Rushagate is this generation's WMD.
[03:08:51.617 --> 03:08:56.521]  WMD damaged the media's reputation, Rushagate may have destroyed it.
[03:08:56.521 --> 03:09:04.387]  The same media that abuses its platform to de-platform and silence others for fake news and misinformation.
[03:09:04.387 --> 03:09:12.454]  When they generated and hyped the largest, most harmful piece of fake news and misinformation for two years solid,
[03:09:12.594 --> 03:09:18.295]  Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have all vowed to crack down on fake news and conspiracy theories.
[03:09:18.295 --> 03:09:31.298]  CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, The Washington Post and every late night comedian all threw their weight behind a conspiracy theory that caused division across the country and undermined democracy.
[03:09:31.298 --> 03:09:33.179]  What punishment will they face?
[03:09:33.499 --> 03:09:35.340]  Will their channels be deleted?
[03:09:35.340 --> 03:09:38.042]  Will they be relegated in the algorithm?
[03:09:38.042 --> 03:09:39.103]  Don't hold your breath!
[03:09:39.103 --> 03:09:42.985]  Alex Jones was wiped out for saying something he apologised for.
[03:09:42.985 --> 03:09:49.089]  Yet the mass media pushed a narrative that destabilised the nation and could have sparked a war.
[03:09:49.089 --> 03:09:50.991]  And nothing will happen to them.
[03:09:50.991 --> 03:09:52.892]  None of them will be held accountable.
[03:09:52.892 --> 03:09:58.876]  For two years solid, every night they told us that the Trump administration was on the verge of collapse.
[03:09:59.216 --> 03:10:01.017]  It's a bombshell.
[03:10:01.017 --> 03:10:02.518]  Today is a turning point.
[03:10:02.518 --> 03:10:04.639]  Today was historically bad for President Trump.
[03:10:04.639 --> 03:10:06.460]  Today was a turning point.
[03:10:06.460 --> 03:10:07.300]  A turning point.
[03:10:07.300 --> 03:10:08.360]  We're at a turning point here.
[03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:11.502]  The beginning of the end for the Trump presidency.
[03:10:11.502 --> 03:10:12.843]  We have another bombshell.
[03:10:12.843 --> 03:10:15.804]  Mike Pence might have to assume the office of the presidency.
[03:10:15.804 --> 03:10:17.565]  Rumblings of the word impeachment.
[03:10:17.565 --> 03:10:18.565]  Breaking news!
[03:10:18.565 --> 03:10:20.266]  Another bombshell out of the White House.
[03:10:20.266 --> 03:10:21.767]  I believe this is the beginning of the end.
[03:10:21.767 --> 03:10:22.387]  I do too.
[03:10:22.387 --> 03:10:23.948]  It's really the beginning of the end.
[03:10:23.948 --> 03:10:26.069]  He may be feeling the walls closing in on him.
[03:10:26.069 --> 03:10:27.810]  All the walls closing in on him.
[03:10:27.810 --> 03:10:28.250]  The walls.
[03:10:28.390 --> 03:10:29.810]  Closing in on him.
[03:10:29.810 --> 03:10:31.291]  Breaking news, a new bombshell.
[03:10:31.291 --> 03:10:35.011]  One astrologer says this means the beginning of the end for President Donald Trump.
[03:10:35.011 --> 03:10:36.132]  Trump will resign.
[03:10:36.132 --> 03:10:37.192]  Trump is going to resign.
[03:10:37.192 --> 03:10:38.612]  Is this the tipping point?
[03:10:38.612 --> 03:10:40.972]  I know we've said it over and over.
[03:10:40.972 --> 03:10:42.213]  You think this is a tipping point?
[03:10:42.213 --> 03:10:43.333]  And over and over.
[03:10:43.333 --> 03:10:44.753]  This is a tipping point.
[03:10:44.753 --> 03:10:45.893]  And over and over.
[03:10:45.893 --> 03:10:47.934]  Breaking news, President Trump off the rails.
[03:10:47.934 --> 03:10:49.194]  This is the beginning of the end today.
[03:10:49.194 --> 03:10:50.434]  The beginning of the end.
[03:10:50.434 --> 03:10:52.115]  Breaking news tonight, new bombshell.
[03:10:52.115 --> 03:10:53.415]  This is the beginning, not the end.
[03:10:53.695 --> 03:10:55.077]  The beginning of the end.
[03:10:55.077 --> 03:10:56.358]  The walls are closing in.
[03:10:56.358 --> 03:10:57.580]  The wall's closing in.
[03:10:57.580 --> 03:10:58.641]  The wall's closing in.
[03:10:58.641 --> 03:11:05.909]  For two years solid, they breathlessly told us that the president had conspired with a hostile nation to steal an election.
[03:11:05.909 --> 03:11:06.350]  Russia.
[03:11:06.350 --> 03:11:06.730]  Russia.
[03:11:06.730 --> 03:11:07.291]  Vladimir Putin.
[03:11:07.291 --> 03:11:07.651]  Russia.
[03:11:07.651 --> 03:11:08.132]  Russia.
[03:11:08.132 --> 03:11:08.572]  Russia.
[03:11:08.572 --> 03:11:09.754]  Russia hates Russia.
[03:11:09.754 --> 03:11:10.274]  Russia.
[03:11:10.274 --> 03:11:10.715]  Russia.
[03:11:10.715 --> 03:11:11.256]  Putin.
[03:11:11.256 --> 03:11:12.056]  Russia's Russia.
[03:11:12.056 --> 03:11:12.337]  Russia.
[03:11:12.337 --> 03:11:12.517]  Russia.
[03:11:12.517 --> 03:11:12.677]  Russia.
[03:11:12.677 --> 03:11:12.817]  Russia.
[03:11:12.817 --> 03:11:12.958]  Russia.
[03:11:12.958 --> 03:11:13.158]  Russia.
[03:11:13.158 --> 03:11:13.298]  Russia.
[03:11:13.298 --> 03:11:13.478]  Russia.
[03:11:13.478 --> 03:11:13.638]  Russia.
[03:11:13.638 --> 03:11:13.839]  Russia.

[03:11:13.979 --> 03:11:14.119]  Russia.
[03:11:14.119 --> 03:11:14.259]  Russia.
[03:11:14.259 --> 03:11:14.459]  Russia.
[03:11:14.459 --> 03:11:14.600]  Russia.
[03:11:14.600 --> 03:11:14.740]  Russia.
[03:11:14.740 --> 03:11:14.920]  Russia.
[03:11:14.920 --> 03:11:15.060]  Russia.
[03:11:15.060 --> 03:11:15.220]  Russia.

[03:11:15.781 --> 03:11:15.921]  Russia.
[03:11:15.921 --> 03:11:16.061]  Russia.
[03:11:16.061 --> 03:11:16.202]  Russia.
[03:11:16.202 --> 03:11:16.342]  Russia.
[03:11:16.342 --> 03:11:16.482]  Russia.
[03:11:16.482 --> 03:11:16.622]  Russia.
[03:11:16.622 --> 03:11:16.762]  Russia.
[03:11:16.762 --> 03:11:16.923]  Russia.

[03:11:29.899 --> 03:11:30.059]  Russia.
[03:11:30.059 --> 03:11:30.219]  Russia.
[03:11:30.219 --> 03:11:30.360]  Russia.
[03:11:30.360 --> 03:11:30.520]  Russia.
[03:11:30.520 --> 03:11:30.640]  Russia.
[03:11:30.760 --> 03:11:31.300]  Russians.
[03:11:31.300 --> 03:11:31.681]  Russians.
[03:11:31.681 --> 03:11:32.802]  Russia against the US.
[03:11:32.802 --> 03:11:33.322]  The Russians.
[03:11:33.322 --> 03:11:33.502]  Russia.
[03:11:33.502 --> 03:11:33.742]  Russia.

[03:11:34.283 --> 03:11:34.603]  Russian.
[03:11:34.603 --> 03:11:35.604]  Russian government scheme.
[03:11:35.604 --> 03:11:36.304]  The Russians.
[03:11:36.304 --> 03:11:36.965]  Vladimir Putin.
[03:11:36.965 --> 03:11:37.325]  Russia.
[03:11:37.325 --> 03:11:38.186]  Vladimir Putin.
[03:11:38.186 --> 03:11:38.386]  Russia.
[03:11:38.386 --> 03:11:38.826]  Putin.
[03:11:38.826 --> 03:11:39.747]  Putin and Russia.
[03:11:39.747 --> 03:11:40.107]  Russia.
[03:11:40.107 --> 03:11:40.707]  Moscow.
[03:11:40.707 --> 03:11:41.128]  Russia.
[03:11:41.128 --> 03:11:41.428]  Russian.
[03:11:41.428 --> 03:11:41.788]  Russia.
[03:11:41.788 --> 03:11:42.249]  Russia.
[03:11:42.249 --> 03:11:43.009]  The Russians.
[03:11:43.009 --> 03:11:43.590]  Russians.
[03:11:43.590 --> 03:11:44.070]  Russians.
[03:11:44.070 --> 03:11:44.450]  Russia.
[03:11:44.450 --> 03:11:44.750]  Russia.
[03:11:44.750 --> 03:11:45.111]  Russian.
[03:11:45.111 --> 03:11:45.531]  Russian.
[03:11:45.531 --> 03:11:46.011]  Russia.
[03:11:46.011 --> 03:11:46.332]  Russia.
[03:11:46.332 --> 03:11:46.732]  Putin.
[03:11:46.732 --> 03:11:47.072]  Putin.
[03:11:47.072 --> 03:11:47.372]  Putin.
[03:11:47.372 --> 03:11:47.693]  Putin.
[03:11:47.693 --> 03:11:48.013]  Putin.
[03:11:48.013 --> 03:11:48.273]  Russia.
[03:11:48.273 --> 03:11:48.653]  Russian.
[03:11:48.653 --> 03:11:49.174]  Russian.
[03:11:49.174 --> 03:11:49.394]  Russia.
[03:11:49.514 --> 03:11:55.458]  And exactly as I said over two years ago, it all turned out to be complete bonk.
[03:11:55.458 --> 03:12:06.825]  40 FBI agents, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 witnesses, 500 search warrants, 230 communications records, 50 phone taps, 13 foreign government intel requests.
[03:12:06.825 --> 03:12:08.506]  No collusion.
[03:12:08.506 --> 03:12:10.428]  No evidence of obstruction.
[03:12:10.428 --> 03:12:12.049]  The media lied to you.
[03:12:12.049 --> 03:12:13.770]  Again and again and again.
[03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:23.480]  They peddled the biggest fake news hoax in a generation, while pointing their fingers at people like me, demanding we be silenced for fake news.
[03:12:23.480 --> 03:12:31.228]  The people screaming about Trump working for Russia are the same people demanding social media censor misinformation.
[03:12:31.228 --> 03:12:31.529]  Stop.
[03:12:32.009 --> 03:12:33.750]  Listening to these people.
[03:12:33.750 --> 03:12:49.562]  If you're an MSNBC viewer or reader of liberal sites on the internet, you were fed a steady stream of conspiratorial bullshit that completely warped your view of the world, all while they purposely excluded anyone who questioned their fraud and profited off of your fears.
[03:12:49.562 --> 03:13:01.291]  Many of them are so delusional that even after the Mueller Report completely debunked their conspiracy theory, even after being totally humiliated, they're still claiming there was Russian collusion.
[03:13:01.451 --> 03:13:02.191]  I'm not owned!
[03:13:02.191 --> 03:13:02.832]  I'm not owned!
[03:13:02.832 --> 03:13:06.953]  I continue to insist as I slowly shrink and transform into a corncob.
[03:13:06.953 --> 03:13:11.395]  Russian collusion conspiracy theorists are the flat earthers of politics.
[03:13:11.395 --> 03:13:12.656]  They won't apologize.
[03:13:12.656 --> 03:13:15.057]  They won't reflect on their hysteria.
[03:13:15.057 --> 03:13:17.598]  Their hysteria will only be elevated.
[03:13:17.598 --> 03:13:18.959]  No one will be fired.
[03:13:18.959 --> 03:13:20.380]  No one will be disciplined.
[03:13:20.380 --> 03:13:24.801]  Are you ever going to have a single moment of self-awareness?
[03:13:24.801 --> 03:13:28.123]  Are you ever going to stop being partisan hacks?
[03:13:28.343 --> 03:13:34.745]  Are you ever going to realize the reason you lost the election wasn't Russian Facebook ads or Twitter bots?
[03:13:34.745 --> 03:13:43.787]  It was because you fielded an unpopular candidate who embodied a neoliberal elitist agenda that the entire world is now rejecting.
[03:13:43.787 --> 03:13:49.149]  And after having spent the last two years hyping the importance and credibility of the Mueller Report,
[03:13:49.209 --> 03:13:53.070]  They're now telling everyone to disregard the Mueller report!
[03:13:53.070 --> 03:13:54.690]  I don't care what's in that report!
[03:13:54.690 --> 03:13:56.611]  This is like Brexit all over again.
[03:13:56.611 --> 03:13:57.291]  What do you want to do?
[03:13:57.291 --> 03:14:01.892]  Keep having investigation after investigation until you get the result you want?
[03:14:01.892 --> 03:14:07.593]  The only way the conspiracy theory can survive is by metastasizing into an even bigger conspiracy.
[03:14:07.593 --> 03:14:10.374]  Now Mueller himself was part of the conspiracy.
[03:14:10.374 --> 03:14:11.094]  Hey Democrats!
[03:14:11.474 --> 03:14:13.915]  Maybe now drop the conspiracy theories.
[03:14:13.915 --> 03:14:17.577]  Maybe drop demonising half of the American population.
[03:14:17.577 --> 03:14:23.720]  Maybe drop the relentless, frothing hysteria and the endless contrived moral panics.
[03:14:23.720 --> 03:14:31.064]  Maybe now, oh I don't know, become an actual political party with policies that actually resonate with the American people.
[03:14:31.064 --> 03:14:32.064]  Just an idea.
[03:14:32.064 --> 03:14:39.328]  Hey media, instead of abusing your platforms to silence your competition and destabilise democracy, maybe go back.
[03:14:39.508 --> 03:14:44.213]  to doing actual, non-partisan, unbiased journalism.
[03:14:44.213 --> 03:14:45.294]  Just an idea.
[03:15:03.769 --> 03:15:08.451]  Google, because Alex Jones was for misinformation.
[03:15:08.451 --> 03:15:10.632]  No, I was for questioning real things.
[03:15:10.632 --> 03:15:13.434]  And they shouldn't get banned for questioning.
[03:15:13.434 --> 03:15:19.797]  They should get arrested for creating the fake investigation and trying to plant evidence, which has now come out.
[03:15:19.797 --> 03:15:21.078]  We have the text messages.
[03:15:21.078 --> 03:15:22.178]  We have the proof.
[03:15:22.178 --> 03:15:29.202]  That's how they get prosecuted, trying to bring the president down in an orchestrated coup, an inside job, what did Trump call it, a takedown.
[03:15:30.219 --> 03:15:36.606]  They can sit up there and say the moon's made of cheese and Trump's an Easter Bunny or a Russian agent that wears fur caps.
[03:15:36.606 --> 03:15:42.793]  That's their right to do, but they can't collude with the government to try to overturn the election knowing it's a fraud.
[03:15:42.793 --> 03:15:47.238]  So now they're using the left's censorship of me to call for the left to be censored.
[03:15:47.238 --> 03:15:49.481]  No, let's not turn into them!
[03:15:49.481 --> 03:15:50.422]  Will Johnson coming up.
[03:15:53.114 --> 03:15:56.696]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[03:17:59.270 --> 03:18:07.832]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:18:07.832 --> 03:18:10.813]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:18:10.813 --> 03:18:12.554]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:18:12.554 --> 03:18:18.835]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.

[03:18:37.123 --> 03:18:38.944]  I've got two in my home.

[03:18:50.769 --> 03:18:52.230]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:18:52.230 --> 03:19:02.555]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:19:02.555 --> 03:19:04.015]  Believe me, I know.
[03:19:04.015 --> 03:19:08.717]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:19:08.717 --> 03:19:11.799]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarsstore.com,
[03:19:12.259 --> 03:19:13.941]  I still have that energy.
[03:19:13.941 --> 03:19:34.100]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:19:34.600 --> 03:19:38.361]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[03:19:57.069 --> 03:19:59.730]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:17.206 --> 03:20:18.246]  Welcome, welcome.
[03:20:18.246 --> 03:20:20.547]  You are watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.547 --> 03:20:21.828]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:20:21.828 --> 03:20:26.249]  I will be standing in for Alex Jones for the rest of the show.
[03:20:26.249 --> 03:20:27.569]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:20:27.569 --> 03:20:28.790]  Thank you for staying with us.
[03:20:28.790 --> 03:20:31.571]  There's a lot happening in the news.
[03:20:31.571 --> 03:20:33.791]  I'm pretty sure everyone is aware of the Mueller report.
[03:20:33.791 --> 03:20:36.452]  Of course, Alex Jones was just talking about it.
[03:20:36.452 --> 03:20:40.534]  Awesome report from Paul Watson.
[03:20:40.534 --> 03:20:42.574]  And there's so much going on.
[03:20:42.574 --> 03:20:44.595]  It's almost like I don't know where to start.
[03:20:45.396 --> 03:20:49.159]  But where I'm going to start is with Ilhan Omar.
[03:20:49.159 --> 03:20:52.081]  Just this past weekend, I was in L.A.
[03:20:52.081 --> 03:20:56.345]  where she was speaking at a CARE event.
[03:20:56.345 --> 03:21:09.075]  And at this CARE event, we had roughly over a thousand people that are Americans that were there protesting against CARE for hosting this event with Ilhan Omar.
[03:21:09.759 --> 03:21:16.822]  Ilhan Omar, she's the one that has the whole anti-Semitic statement against Israel.
[03:21:16.822 --> 03:21:26.685]  And it's already been proven that Ilhan Omar and CARE absolutely work together with Hamas as a terrorist organization.
[03:21:26.685 --> 03:21:33.868]  It's kind of remarkable to me that we have a terrorist organization that's operating with inside of the borders of the United States.
[03:21:33.868 --> 03:21:35.028]  And it's not even a secret.
[03:21:35.783 --> 03:21:44.334]  But because of the Democratic Party policies, they've embraced and endorsed this whole anti-Semitic.
[03:21:44.334 --> 03:21:49.461]  They came out with a whole resolution trying to make it look like that they're not hateful towards Jewish people.
[03:21:49.461 --> 03:21:52.305]  Even our President Donald J. Trump came out with a statement talking about
[03:21:53.582 --> 03:22:00.104]  How the Democratic Party does not like the Jewish community, which is a true statement.
[03:22:00.104 --> 03:22:02.025]  They've demonstrated it multiple times.
[03:22:02.025 --> 03:22:07.946]  Even when President Trump moved the embassy to Jerusalem, the Democrats were not happy about it.
[03:22:07.946 --> 03:22:16.009]  Every time President Trump put in policies trying to protect the American people against Muslims that want to come destroy the country.
[03:22:16.009 --> 03:22:17.289]  And not all Muslims are bad.
[03:22:17.289 --> 03:22:19.610]  President Trump has already admitted that.
[03:22:20.362 --> 03:22:26.405]  But they get upset every time President Trump tried to do something that's going to protect the American people.
[03:22:26.405 --> 03:22:29.726]  Because of this, we are where we are.
[03:22:29.726 --> 03:22:32.527]  I was in LA this past weekend.
[03:22:32.527 --> 03:22:37.769]  And like I said, it was over a thousand people protesting against Ilhan Omar.
[03:22:37.769 --> 03:22:40.150]  And she came out with a statement.
[03:22:40.150 --> 03:22:42.171]  And I'm going to play this video clip for you.
[03:22:42.171 --> 03:22:46.893]  How about the American people standing outside protesting against her?
[03:22:48.039 --> 03:22:53.800]  And her statement is completely bonkers, if you ask me.
[03:22:53.800 --> 03:23:07.782]  So without me continue going on, bumbling, rumbling on, I'm going to show you this clip with Ilhan Omar and how she's addressing us, the American people, outside of this CARE event.
[03:23:07.782 --> 03:23:10.663]  So I'm going to put this on the screen for you.
[03:23:10.663 --> 03:23:11.783]  And you can see it here.
[03:23:11.783 --> 03:23:14.284]  So just listen to what she says here.
[03:23:14.284 --> 03:23:16.944]  There are very fascinating people outside.
[03:23:19.545 --> 03:23:27.170]  Who for so many years have spoken about an Islam that is oppressive.
[03:23:27.170 --> 03:23:34.094]  An Islam that lessens and isolates its women.
[03:23:34.094 --> 03:23:44.981]  And today they gather outside to protest a Muslim woman who is in Congress!
[03:23:44.981 --> 03:23:48.463]  I mean the irony, the irony in that
[03:23:49.386 --> 03:23:50.266]  The irony.
[03:23:50.266 --> 03:23:51.887]  It's very entertaining to me.
[03:23:51.887 --> 03:24:00.069]  I know, I know many of them drove miles to get here.
[03:24:00.069 --> 03:24:06.790]  Spent a lot of energy and resources and money to purchase the signs that they have.
[03:24:06.790 --> 03:24:16.893]  But I don't think any of them realize that people like myself and many of the people in this room can care less about what they have to say.
[03:24:18.755 --> 03:24:19.636]  Really?
[03:24:19.636 --> 03:24:20.576]  Really?
[03:24:20.576 --> 03:24:21.757]  She care less?
[03:24:21.757 --> 03:24:28.401]  Her and the people in the room care less what Americans have to say?
[03:24:28.401 --> 03:24:29.342]  Did you hear?
[03:24:29.342 --> 03:24:30.182]  She just said it.
[03:24:30.182 --> 03:24:32.124]  I'm not putting words in her mouth.
[03:24:32.124 --> 03:24:34.185]  She straight up said that she could care less.
[03:24:34.185 --> 03:24:40.829]  Her and the people in the room could care less on what Americans have to say.
[03:24:40.829 --> 03:24:47.994]  And if we're supposed to believe what she's saying as truth, that we should care less what Americans have to say?
[03:24:49.289 --> 03:24:56.235]  That should send a signal to everybody in this country that they do not care about America.
[03:24:56.235 --> 03:25:00.099]  Now, the people that were standing out there, they're not there for Islam.
[03:25:00.099 --> 03:25:05.563]  They didn't come to the protest, this whole rally, because they want to show their support for Islam.
[03:25:05.563 --> 03:25:07.685]  They're speaking out against Islam.
[03:25:07.685 --> 03:25:12.550]  And then she says she finds it ironic that she's Muslim and she's in Congress.
[03:25:14.241 --> 03:25:23.670]  Now, to my understanding, unless it has changed, you have to be an American citizen in order to be a member of Congress.
[03:25:23.670 --> 03:25:33.558]  So, her being an American citizen, and now she's a member of Congress, is the only reason why she is a Congresswoman.
[03:25:33.558 --> 03:25:35.480]  See, she left that part out.
[03:25:35.480 --> 03:25:39.404]  Now, if she was in the Middle East, would she have the same rights?
[03:25:40.074 --> 03:25:47.877]  Would she be able to stand before the men that was at this event and speak to them with authority?
[03:25:47.877 --> 03:25:49.217]  Think about that.
[03:25:49.217 --> 03:25:51.838]  See, that's the part that she's leaving out.
[03:25:51.838 --> 03:25:53.219]  Of course, you're a woman.
[03:25:53.219 --> 03:25:54.359]  You're in America.
[03:25:54.359 --> 03:25:55.219]  You have rights.
[03:25:55.219 --> 03:25:58.160]  You have every means necessary.
[03:25:58.160 --> 03:26:00.601]  You have every ability to become somebody.
[03:26:00.601 --> 03:26:04.562]  You have every rights to become a Congresswoman.
[03:26:04.562 --> 03:26:05.943]  That's what America is about.
[03:26:07.347 --> 03:26:08.548]  It's not the Republicans.
[03:26:08.548 --> 03:26:11.791]  It's not the American people that want to keep women suppressed.
[03:26:11.791 --> 03:26:13.072]  It is Islam.
[03:26:13.072 --> 03:26:18.716]  If you went over to the Middle East, she would not be in the position she's in right now.
[03:26:18.716 --> 03:26:21.738]  The only reason why she's there, because she's where?
[03:26:21.738 --> 03:26:22.779]  In America.
[03:26:22.779 --> 03:26:25.621]  The United States of America.
[03:26:25.621 --> 03:26:27.643]  That's the only reason.
[03:26:27.643 --> 03:26:29.024]  It's really a no-brainer.
[03:26:30.248 --> 03:26:35.751]  And see, the people in there, they're not hearing that, so they're only going based on what she's saying.
[03:26:35.751 --> 03:26:47.156]  The whole objective here is to convince the American people that Islam is for women, which we all know is not.
[03:26:47.156 --> 03:26:50.218]  Would she be willing to take the hijab off?
[03:26:50.218 --> 03:26:53.619]  Would she be willing to take the thing off her head off?
[03:26:53.619 --> 03:26:54.820]  Why not show her hair?
[03:26:54.820 --> 03:26:58.482]  And has she been presented with the question about Israel
[03:26:59.611 --> 03:27:03.972]  Having their freedom, Israel being a state.
[03:27:03.972 --> 03:27:08.833]  She's come out multiple times with her hatred toward Israel.
[03:27:08.833 --> 03:27:14.795]  And can you imagine how she feels with President Trump showing his support for Israel?
[03:27:14.795 --> 03:27:25.777]  Never before in the history of this nation, we've had other presidents in the past saying that they're going to do X, Y, Z for Israel and does nothing.
[03:27:25.777 --> 03:27:27.278]  Zero, not a zip.
[03:27:27.278 --> 03:27:29.018]  But here it is, President Trump.
[03:27:29.631 --> 03:27:32.233]  Keeping his word.
[03:27:32.233 --> 03:27:34.734]  That is the major problem.
[03:27:34.734 --> 03:27:37.716]  That is the major problem when it comes to the Democrats.
[03:27:37.716 --> 03:27:43.679]  You have a president of the United States keeping his word and they don't like it.
[03:27:43.679 --> 03:27:48.782]  Just to give you a really quick brief, you have the Central for Security Policy.
[03:27:48.782 --> 03:27:55.486]  They even came out with a statement showing how CARE is a domestic terrorist group.
[03:27:55.486 --> 03:27:56.346]  They laid out the proof.
[03:27:56.346 --> 03:27:57.707]  There's documentation on it.
[03:27:58.880 --> 03:28:04.001]  They've already lined it out for all of us to see.
[03:28:04.001 --> 03:28:05.682]  What more do you need to see?
[03:28:05.682 --> 03:28:07.582]  What more evidence do you need to see?
[03:28:07.582 --> 03:28:08.843]  It is all there.
[03:28:08.843 --> 03:28:13.024]  She just plainly laid it out that she's not here for the American people.
[03:28:13.024 --> 03:28:15.164]  She's here for Islam.
[03:28:15.164 --> 03:28:20.466]  For her, the Sharia comes above all other things.
[03:28:20.466 --> 03:28:22.166]  Sharia is the one.
[03:28:22.166 --> 03:28:24.947]  Sharia is the only one for them.
[03:28:24.947 --> 03:28:26.708]  Okay, so we're going to go to a break here.
[03:28:26.708 --> 03:28:28.128]  But before we go, I want to say this.
[03:28:28.820 --> 03:28:30.802]  InfoWars.com.

[03:28:42.234 --> 03:28:44.716]  I actually have some of the Protein Bars.
[03:28:44.716 --> 03:28:46.198]  They are fulfilling.
[03:28:46.198 --> 03:28:48.260]  My name is Will Johnson, The Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:48.260 --> 03:28:50.062]  We'll be right back after this short break.
[03:28:53.114 --> 03:28:56.716]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.716 --> 03:29:00.277]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.277 --> 03:29:02.418]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[03:29:54.286 --> 03:29:59.128]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[03:29:59.128 --> 03:30:08.593]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[03:30:08.593 --> 03:30:13.375]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[03:30:23.700 --> 03:30:24.200]  I think so.
[03:30:54.096 --> 03:30:56.137]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:30:56.137 --> 03:30:56.778]  Go ahead.
[03:30:56.778 --> 03:30:58.999]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[03:30:58.999 --> 03:31:02.862]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:31:02.862 --> 03:31:04.283]  It just gets old, man.
[03:31:04.283 --> 03:31:06.704]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[03:31:06.704 --> 03:31:09.026]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:31:09.026 --> 03:31:13.049]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:31:13.049 --> 03:31:16.351]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:31:16.351 --> 03:31:19.032]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:31:19.032 --> 03:31:20.393]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[03:31:20.393 --> 03:31:21.514]  Us being shut down?
[03:31:21.514 --> 03:31:22.535]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:31:22.975 --> 03:31:24.036]  You know what, Alex?
[03:31:24.036 --> 03:31:25.417]  Put him on pause again.
[03:31:25.417 --> 03:31:26.237]  Hey, Frank!
[03:31:26.237 --> 03:31:31.921]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[03:31:31.921 --> 03:31:36.424]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:31:36.424 --> 03:31:39.566]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:31:39.566 --> 03:31:40.027]  You understand?
[03:31:40.027 --> 03:31:41.668]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:31:41.668 --> 03:31:42.788]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:31:43.789 --> 03:31:49.411]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[03:31:49.411 --> 03:31:50.231]  Do you understand?
[03:31:50.231 --> 03:31:51.752]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:31:51.752 --> 03:31:53.893]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[03:31:53.893 --> 03:31:57.854]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:57.854 --> 03:32:01.155]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:32:01.155 --> 03:32:07.398]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:07.398 --> 03:32:10.179]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:32:10.919 --> 03:32:14.742]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:14.742 --> 03:32:21.206]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:21.206 --> 03:32:26.170]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:26.929 --> 03:32:30.851]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:32:30.851 --> 03:32:38.055]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:38.055 --> 03:32:42.757]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:42.757 --> 03:32:48.961]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:48.961 --> 03:32:52.923]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:57.091 --> 03:33:14.643]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.643 --> 03:33:17.264]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.264 --> 03:33:18.865]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:33:18.865 --> 03:33:22.428]  I am hosting this last hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.430 --> 03:33:26.871]  Thank you for coming back and staying with us.
[03:33:26.871 --> 03:33:32.132]  The last segment I was talking about Ilhan Omar and the event that she had in L.A.
[03:33:32.132 --> 03:33:33.713]  this past weekend.
[03:33:33.713 --> 03:33:38.354]  And one of the things that I want to show you was and I actually put up on the screen here.
[03:33:38.354 --> 03:33:42.275]  This was the security.
[03:33:42.275 --> 03:33:45.856]  This was the central for security policy.
[03:33:45.856 --> 03:33:49.457]  And on their website, they show that, you know, car is Hamas.
[03:33:49.457 --> 03:33:52.658]  And they actually have the documentation where they prove that
[03:33:53.442 --> 03:33:55.143]  They are a terrorist group.
[03:33:55.143 --> 03:33:57.384]  And I'm not going to go through everything on here.
[03:33:57.384 --> 03:34:10.492]  But one of the things that people should realize is that even the founder of this car organization, they even came out with a statement talking about how they say they believe.
[03:34:10.492 --> 03:34:12.333]  And I'm going to read this word for word.
[03:34:12.333 --> 03:34:21.319]  Now, I quote, he says, it is important to mislead Americans about the future and the nature of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:34:22.461 --> 03:34:29.024]  It is support and it supports the terrorist acts against Israel.
[03:34:29.024 --> 03:34:30.784]  So they don't want people to realize that.
[03:34:30.784 --> 03:34:32.625]  They don't want people to know that.
[03:34:32.625 --> 03:34:34.966]  That's the part that's really amazing about all this.
[03:34:34.966 --> 03:34:36.806]  The documentation is out there.
[03:34:36.806 --> 03:34:38.387]  They're no longer hiding it.
[03:34:38.387 --> 03:34:41.728]  It's in plain sight and the Democrats are actually embracing it.
[03:34:41.728 --> 03:34:43.529]  That's the scary part about all of this.
[03:34:44.173 --> 03:34:51.636]  So, but the main topic today, the main story that's buzzing around, well, actually, there should be two main topics buzzing around.
[03:34:51.636 --> 03:34:54.958]  And I'm gonna get to that second topic here in just a minute.
[03:34:54.958 --> 03:35:05.982]  But the main one that everyone is talking about, all the mainstream news media, the outlets, Infowars, Breitbart, Drudge Report, all of them is the Russia no collusion.
[03:35:05.982 --> 03:35:07.923]  It should just be called that, Russia no collusion.
[03:35:08.792 --> 03:35:19.221]  You know, the Democrats for the last two years have been attacking the president day in and day out, as long as they can to get at the president.
[03:35:19.221 --> 03:35:32.433]  Never in the history of this world, or this country rather, have the Democrats, the mainstream media, even some Republicans have done everything they could to take out the president of the United States.
[03:35:34.292 --> 03:35:44.394]  So this, this whole Russia collusion has been more than $25 million dollars, our dollars spent.
[03:35:44.394 --> 03:35:48.894]  Now, everyone who hears that should be highly upset.
[03:35:48.894 --> 03:35:50.835]  Do we get a refund?
[03:35:50.835 --> 03:35:53.155]  Does that money come back to us?
[03:35:53.155 --> 03:35:53.755]  I think not.
[03:35:53.755 --> 03:35:56.216]  It's just money gone.
[03:35:56.216 --> 03:35:58.216]  I mean, they spent this money.
[03:35:58.216 --> 03:36:00.616]  I mean, where are the checks and balances at?
[03:36:00.616 --> 03:36:03.397]  I mean, President Trump came out, it's a total witch hunt.
[03:36:05.285 --> 03:36:10.550]  And everybody's talking about it and everyone should pay attention to what's happening here.
[03:36:10.550 --> 03:36:12.331]  It's completely despicable.
[03:36:12.331 --> 03:36:16.074]  2,800 subpoenas.
[03:36:16.074 --> 03:36:18.676]  No collusion, mind you.
[03:36:18.676 --> 03:36:23.981]  After the 2,800 subpoenas, 2,800.
[03:36:23.981 --> 03:36:26.042]  Think about that number, 2,800 subpoenas.
[03:36:26.042 --> 03:36:32.508]  Imagine the man hours it took for 2,800 subpoenas with no collusion.
[03:36:34.772 --> 03:36:37.593]  500 witnesses?
[03:36:37.593 --> 03:36:37.933]  Really?
[03:36:37.933 --> 03:36:42.414]  500 witnesses, and where's the collusion?
[03:36:42.414 --> 03:36:46.775]  There is still no collusion after 500 witnesses.
[03:36:46.775 --> 03:36:50.475]  And you know what's really amazing about all of it?
[03:36:50.475 --> 03:37:02.118]  Is that with shifty shift, knowing that there's no collusion after the report coming out, shifty shift is upset, the Democrat Party's upset,
[03:37:02.879 --> 03:37:09.902]  The liberal media is upset that there is no collusion.
[03:37:09.902 --> 03:37:12.903]  So now they're going with obstruction.
[03:37:12.903 --> 03:37:16.364]  See, they have been talking about obstruction before the report came out.
[03:37:16.364 --> 03:37:25.108]  And the main reason I believe that they've been talking about obstruction before the report came out, because they knew for a fact there was no Russia collusion.
[03:37:25.108 --> 03:37:27.069]  They knew it.
[03:37:27.069 --> 03:37:28.169]  It was already spelled out.
[03:37:28.169 --> 03:37:32.371]  Don't forget about Nancy Pelosi talking about, well, you know what, we need to move on.
[03:37:33.402 --> 03:37:34.023]  How long ago?
[03:37:34.023 --> 03:37:35.804]  She just did that recently.
[03:37:35.804 --> 03:37:37.646]  A lot of people don't even know that.
[03:37:37.646 --> 03:37:40.027]  A lot of people don't even realize that.
[03:37:40.027 --> 03:37:41.349]  She just admitted.
[03:37:41.349 --> 03:37:45.112]  So now they're going with the whole obstruction of justice.
[03:37:45.112 --> 03:37:51.737]  Why in the world would President Trump have to do obstruction when he did nothing wrong?
[03:37:51.737 --> 03:37:53.318]  Think about that.
[03:37:53.318 --> 03:38:00.184]  You know, if someone says that, Hey, you just stole that car and you got the license and registration to the vehicle.
[03:38:02.264 --> 03:38:11.888]  And if you don't show someone who's just making up these lies, your license and registration, they're saying that you're obstructing.
[03:38:11.888 --> 03:38:24.713]  And then if they get a subpoena and they do all this stuff, they do this report, they go down to the DMV and they find out that you actually own the vehicle, they're going to say that you were obstructing because you didn't want to show them your license and registration.
[03:38:24.713 --> 03:38:26.173]  I'm not talking about a police officer.
[03:38:26.173 --> 03:38:28.894]  I'm talking about someone who's made up this whole thing.
[03:38:28.894 --> 03:38:30.235]  That's exactly what this is.
[03:38:31.343 --> 03:38:32.464]  Oh, you're obstructing.
[03:38:32.464 --> 03:38:36.768]  So now they don't have any collusion with Russia.
[03:38:36.768 --> 03:38:38.910]  So let's make, let's go with Russia.
[03:38:38.910 --> 03:38:40.231]  Let's say that he obstructed.
[03:38:40.231 --> 03:38:41.552]  It's the witch hunt.
[03:38:41.552 --> 03:38:44.295]  They're not going to stop the witch hunt.
[03:38:44.295 --> 03:38:46.316]  This whole witch hunt is going to continue.
[03:38:46.316 --> 03:38:49.920]  It's not going to stop.
[03:38:49.920 --> 03:38:52.021]  They are completely upset by it.
[03:38:52.021 --> 03:38:58.227]  So I have a short clip that I want to play of Shifty Shift after he found out, and this is from Sunday.
[03:38:58.877 --> 03:39:08.402]  With Shifty Schiff complaining about his whole thing about Russia collusion and how they're not going to stop because they're moving on to obstruction now.
[03:39:08.402 --> 03:39:17.627]  And I don't know if you recall a while back where Shifty Schiff said that, well, if they come out and they find out in the report, basically, I'm paraphrasing here.
[03:39:17.627 --> 03:39:21.329]  They come out and they find out that there was no collusion.
[03:39:21.329 --> 03:39:23.570]  We're going to have our own investigation.
[03:39:23.570 --> 03:39:25.711]  So basically this is how you put it.
[03:39:26.693 --> 03:39:34.796]  Basically, you have this whole Russia collusion is dead, is done, in the casket, buried, funeral.
[03:39:34.796 --> 03:39:42.059]  The Democrats and shifty-shift and the rest of them, even the liberal media, they're going to dig up that casket and have their own funeral.
[03:39:42.059 --> 03:39:52.263]  They're going to dig up those bones and look at the same bones that everyone's been looking at for the last two years and say, try to come up with something else different about this dead body that's in this casket.
[03:39:53.388 --> 03:39:54.850]  And have their own funeral.
[03:39:54.850 --> 03:39:56.812]  That's the insanity of all of this.
[03:39:56.812 --> 03:39:58.494]  So let me put this clip up here.
[03:39:58.494 --> 03:40:00.736]  This is with our Shifty Shifts.
[03:40:00.736 --> 03:40:02.618]  Congressman Shifty Shifts.
[03:40:02.618 --> 03:40:03.199]  Check this out.
[03:40:06.268 --> 03:40:15.374]  You know, the biggest news from Robert Mueller so far is that there are no new indictments for that underlying any cooperation or conspiracy with the Russians to interfere in our elections.
[03:40:15.374 --> 03:40:20.398]  And we're already seeing Rudy Giuliani come out with a tweet yesterday about that, citing you.
[03:40:20.398 --> 03:40:24.781]  He said your previous statement saying there is significant evidence of collusion involving the Trump campaign.
[03:40:24.781 --> 03:40:29.384]  I trust he, Adam Schiff, is relieved there is no collusion, and I hope he will apologize for his mistake.
[03:40:29.384 --> 03:40:30.344]  We all make them.
[03:40:30.344 --> 03:40:31.545]  The real virtue is to admit it.
[03:40:31.545 --> 03:40:32.306]  It would help us heal.
[03:40:32.306 --> 03:40:33.747]  Are you going to apologize?
[03:40:35.197 --> 03:40:42.041]  I think Mr. Giuliani would be wise to wait until the report is made public before making any pronouncements about vindication.
[03:40:42.041 --> 03:40:45.043]  You have said though in the past there is significant evidence of collusion.
[03:40:45.043 --> 03:40:48.865]  How do you square that with Robert Mueller's decision not to indict anyone?
[03:40:50.223 --> 03:41:10.937]  And there is significant evidence of collusion and we've set that out time and time again from the secret meetings in Trump Tower to the conversations between Flynn, the Russian ambassador, to the providing of polling data to someone linked to Russian intelligence and Stone's conversation with WikiLeaks and the GRU through... None of it was prosecuted.
[03:41:10.937 --> 03:41:11.498]  No, that's true.
[03:41:11.498 --> 03:41:14.740]  None of it was prosecuted.
[03:41:14.740 --> 03:41:16.561]  And you go, no, that's true.
[03:41:16.561 --> 03:41:17.382]  There's nothing there.
[03:41:17.382 --> 03:41:19.203]  It's a nothing burger.
[03:41:20.054 --> 03:41:22.796]  They still can't get over the fact that they can't get anything.
[03:41:22.796 --> 03:41:30.062]  They're digging up dead bones, trying to make something out of these dead bones.
[03:41:30.062 --> 03:41:38.728]  Even Lindsey Graham is now talking about how come they didn't investigate the other side.
[03:41:38.728 --> 03:41:39.549]  Right?
[03:41:39.549 --> 03:41:47.175]  I mean, seriously, if you really want to talk about Russia collusion, when you want to look into the fake steel dossier,
[03:41:48.798 --> 03:41:52.479]  Did all of this start with the dossier?
[03:41:52.479 --> 03:41:54.160]  The Pfizer report?
[03:41:54.160 --> 03:42:00.681]  I mean, when they went to the Pfizer court, did they question about this information?
[03:42:00.681 --> 03:42:05.403]  Is that information in the full Mueller report about the dossier?
[03:42:05.403 --> 03:42:08.423]  I mean, what started it?
[03:42:08.423 --> 03:42:13.605]  They were investigating a candidate running for president, someone that was working on the campaign.
[03:42:14.600 --> 03:42:15.540]  And didn't inform him.
[03:42:15.540 --> 03:42:22.723]  Lindsey Graham even brought up the fact how when Dianne Feinstein was saying what she was saying.
[03:42:22.723 --> 03:42:26.204]  And I'm going to talk a little bit more about that on the other side of this break.
[03:42:26.204 --> 03:42:35.468]  Dianne Feinstein even did what she did talking about she had someone working with her with China, but she let him go because the FBI let her know about it.
[03:42:35.468 --> 03:42:38.349]  But they didn't let President Trump know about it.
[03:42:38.349 --> 03:42:40.990]  More on the other side of this break.
[03:42:40.990 --> 03:42:42.210]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:42:42.210 --> 03:42:43.651]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:44.656 --> 03:42:45.236]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:06.627 --> 03:43:18.998]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[03:43:18.998 --> 03:43:20.919]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:43:20.919 --> 03:43:23.582]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:43:24.957 --> 03:43:29.281]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[03:43:29.281 --> 03:43:33.546]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[03:43:33.546 --> 03:43:35.828]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[03:43:35.828 --> 03:43:37.209]  This country is in a war!
[03:43:38.132 --> 03:43:48.834]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[03:43:48.834 --> 03:43:49.654]  I'm in your hands.
[03:43:49.654 --> 03:43:50.675]  You're in my hands.
[03:43:50.675 --> 03:43:52.075]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:43:52.075 --> 03:43:53.295]  Thank you.
[03:43:53.295 --> 03:43:56.376]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.
[03:43:56.376 --> 03:43:59.316]  During the fall, they'd have it during the winter.
[03:43:59.316 --> 03:44:02.257]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:44:02.257 --> 03:44:06.818]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patronage supply, one of the top
[03:44:07.867 --> 03:44:17.012]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[03:44:17.012 --> 03:44:22.374]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[03:44:22.374 --> 03:44:24.656]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[03:44:24.656 --> 03:44:28.157]  MFORESTORE.COM on MFORESELECT storable foods.
[03:44:28.157 --> 03:44:29.638]  They've got special diet foods.
[03:44:29.638 --> 03:44:33.620]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[03:44:33.620 --> 03:44:35.621]  They've got so many great products there.
[03:44:35.621 --> 03:44:36.922]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[03:44:37.382 --> 03:44:39.364]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[03:44:39.364 --> 03:44:41.907]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[03:44:41.907 --> 03:44:46.913]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[03:44:46.913 --> 03:44:52.299]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[03:44:53.968 --> 03:44:56.210]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[03:44:56.210 --> 03:44:57.951]  There is no set stasis.
[03:44:57.951 --> 03:44:59.192]  There is no managed system.
[03:44:59.192 --> 03:45:00.853]  There is no un-continuum.
[03:45:00.853 --> 03:45:04.075]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[03:45:04.075 --> 03:45:07.437]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[03:45:07.437 --> 03:45:08.658]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[03:45:08.658 --> 03:45:09.439]  We'll be here forever.
[03:45:09.439 --> 03:45:10.720]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[03:45:10.720 --> 03:45:17.604]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[03:45:17.604 --> 03:45:18.165]  We made it.
[03:45:18.165 --> 03:45:20.346]  And that's really where this goes.
[03:45:20.346 --> 03:45:22.148]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[03:45:22.148 --> 03:45:22.508]  And so,
[03:45:22.708 --> 03:45:29.315]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[03:45:29.315 --> 03:45:34.240]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[03:45:34.240 --> 03:45:37.103]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[03:45:37.103 --> 03:45:39.505]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:45:39.505 --> 03:45:43.009]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[03:45:43.009 --> 03:45:44.030]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:45:44.270 --> 03:45:47.393]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.
[03:45:47.393 --> 03:45:48.534]  Not these devil worshippers.
[03:45:48.534 --> 03:45:51.257]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[03:45:51.257 --> 03:45:52.518]  I want life!
[03:45:52.518 --> 03:45:54.099]  I want Jesus!
[03:45:54.099 --> 03:45:57.002]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[03:45:57.002 --> 03:45:59.004]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[03:45:59.004 --> 03:46:01.926]  And most of them are funded by the globalists.
[03:46:01.926 --> 03:46:04.649]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[03:46:05.213 --> 03:46:08.335]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[03:46:08.335 --> 03:46:09.876]  I didn't invent all this.
[03:46:09.876 --> 03:46:16.439]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[03:46:16.439 --> 03:46:19.241]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[03:46:20.305 --> 03:46:23.646]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[03:46:23.646 --> 03:46:28.267]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[03:46:28.267 --> 03:46:41.811]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[03:46:41.811 --> 03:46:43.752]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[03:46:44.392 --> 03:46:49.676]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[03:46:49.676 --> 03:46:57.101]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[03:46:57.101 --> 03:46:59.722]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.190 --> 03:47:16.731]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.731 --> 03:47:18.571]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:47:18.571 --> 03:47:19.732]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:47:19.732 --> 03:47:21.792]  Thank you for staying with us.
[03:47:21.792 --> 03:47:26.994]  Absolutely wonderful things, crazy things happening in the world right now today.
[03:47:26.994 --> 03:47:29.735]  Russia, there is no Russia collusion once again.
[03:47:29.735 --> 03:47:38.958]  The last segment I was talking about how Dianne Feinstein had someone working under her and the FBI informed her and they let that person go.
[03:47:39.784 --> 03:47:42.565]  They did not do the same thing under President Trump.
[03:47:42.565 --> 03:47:46.247]  And Lindsey Graham today made that quite clear in his statement today.
[03:47:46.247 --> 03:47:56.971]  Another thing that he mentioned, I thought it was very important to get it across, is that he said that Americans that hate the fact that President Trump did not collude are upset.
[03:47:56.971 --> 03:47:59.092]  They hate this country.
[03:47:59.092 --> 03:48:03.534]  Why would you be upset if President Trump did not collude?
[03:48:03.534 --> 03:48:03.834]  Right?
[03:48:03.834 --> 03:48:05.695]  They don't even sound right.
[03:48:05.695 --> 03:48:07.536]  But Americans that are happy,
[03:48:08.487 --> 03:48:09.729]  That he did not collude?
[03:48:09.729 --> 03:48:11.951]  They love this country.
[03:48:11.951 --> 03:48:13.753]  Think about that.
[03:48:13.753 --> 03:48:14.554]  It goes both ways.
[03:48:14.554 --> 03:48:17.117]  It's absolutely insanity.
[03:48:17.117 --> 03:48:21.943]  Here it is showing that the president did not do anything wrong, and they're upset.
[03:48:21.943 --> 03:48:24.126]  It's like they want the president to do something wrong.
[03:48:25.473 --> 03:48:27.134]  We know why they want him to do something wrong.
[03:48:27.134 --> 03:48:31.076]  They want him to do something wrong because they can't stand him doing the right thing for this country.
[03:48:31.076 --> 03:48:34.258]  They can't stand that he's a positive thing for this country.
[03:48:34.258 --> 03:48:35.319]  They just want him out.
[03:48:35.319 --> 03:48:38.340]  They want to impeach him by any means necessary.
[03:48:38.340 --> 03:48:39.201]  Impeach the president.
[03:48:39.201 --> 03:48:40.922]  Impeach the president.
[03:48:40.922 --> 03:48:41.802]  Get rid of him.
[03:48:41.802 --> 03:48:42.442]  Get rid of him.
[03:48:42.442 --> 03:48:43.563]  We don't like him.
[03:48:43.563 --> 03:48:46.145]  We don't like him.
[03:48:46.145 --> 03:48:48.606]  So with President Trump.
[03:48:49.844 --> 03:48:53.205]  Being, you know, basically there's no collusion.
[03:48:53.205 --> 03:48:56.866]  America has the cloud just lifted off of it.
[03:48:56.866 --> 03:49:02.808]  The Democrats still have this thundercloud over them and they're upset because the rest of us see the light.
[03:49:02.808 --> 03:49:04.428]  We're in the sunshine.
[03:49:04.428 --> 03:49:06.249]  The birds are chirping.
[03:49:06.249 --> 03:49:08.450]  The flowers are blooming.
[03:49:08.450 --> 03:49:11.951]  And for some reason, the Democrats can't stand that fact.
[03:49:11.951 --> 03:49:16.612]  This is a sad day in America for them, but it's a great day for America as a whole.
[03:49:17.566 --> 03:49:19.447]  And we all should be celebrating.
[03:49:19.447 --> 03:49:20.888]  Isn't this what we wanted?
[03:49:20.888 --> 03:49:28.472]  I remember two years ago when people were complaining about President Trump saying, wait until the Mueller report comes out, wait until the Mueller report comes out.
[03:49:28.472 --> 03:49:34.996]  Well, the Mueller report comes out and they don't like the fact that there has been no Russia collusion.
[03:49:34.996 --> 03:49:39.898]  The truth of it, the reality of it, there is no Russia collusion.
[03:49:39.898 --> 03:49:45.301]  And we've all seen how the Democrats demonstrate how they like reality in the year 2019.
[03:49:47.037 --> 03:49:50.099]  They argue, they fight with reality.
[03:49:50.099 --> 03:49:53.202]  Two plus two for them no longer equals four.
[03:49:53.202 --> 03:49:55.844]  Then they're trying to convince everybody that it equals five.
[03:49:55.844 --> 03:50:00.167]  And if you say otherwise, then hey, you're going to be attacked.
[03:50:00.167 --> 03:50:02.048]  They want to remove you from social media.
[03:50:02.048 --> 03:50:07.252]  They want to remove you from, you know, various networks because you're speaking your mind.
[03:50:07.252 --> 03:50:08.833]  You're telling the truth.
[03:50:08.833 --> 03:50:11.415]  You can't, we can't have that.
[03:50:11.415 --> 03:50:13.397]  Think about that.
[03:50:13.397 --> 03:50:14.678]  This is the world we live in.
[03:50:15.566 --> 03:50:21.068]  So with Russia collusion going on, with no Russia collusion going on, I want to show you something here.
[03:50:21.068 --> 03:50:27.010]  This is, this is from part of the report from the Attorney General.
[03:50:27.010 --> 03:50:32.932]  And Attorney General made it clear, and because he made it clear about this, they're upset.
[03:50:32.932 --> 03:50:43.736]  The Democrats are upset because they said he did not take enough time to go through the Mueller report himself, as if he needed more time.
[03:50:43.736 --> 03:50:45.016]  He probably asked Mueller,
[03:50:45.936 --> 03:50:51.558]  Did you find anything that proved that there was anything close to Russia collusion?
[03:50:51.558 --> 03:50:56.180]  And Mueller probably told him, more than likely said, no, there was absolutely nothing.
[03:50:56.180 --> 03:51:00.141]  It was zero evidence that showed Russia collusion.
[03:51:00.141 --> 03:51:02.122]  So it made it pretty simple.
[03:51:02.122 --> 03:51:09.485]  The past two years, $25 million plus later, no Russia collusion.
[03:51:09.485 --> 03:51:10.465]  And what do you expect?
[03:51:11.713 --> 03:51:16.797]  Him to make up something, say, you know what, well, there might be possibly something, but there's no more indictments coming.
[03:51:16.797 --> 03:51:18.578]  So you can't make something up.
[03:51:18.578 --> 03:51:21.380]  So just listen, watch, look at this.
[03:51:21.380 --> 03:51:27.505]  This is part of the report that came from the attorney general.
[03:51:27.505 --> 03:51:32.829]  And it says the special counsel's report is divided into two parts.
[03:51:32.829 --> 03:51:41.396]  The first describes the results of the special counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
[03:51:42.273 --> 03:51:56.004]  The report outlines Russia's efforts to influence the election and documents crimes committed by persons associated with the Russian government connected to those with those efforts.
[03:51:56.004 --> 03:52:09.996]  The report further explains that the primary consideration for the special counsel's investigation was whether any Americans, including individuals associated with the Trump campaign, joined
[03:52:12.630 --> 03:52:31.939]  The special counsel's investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S.
[03:52:31.939 --> 03:52:32.920]  presidential election.
[03:52:34.953 --> 03:52:47.697]  As the report states, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its interference activities.
[03:52:47.697 --> 03:52:53.099]  So we all can agree that Russia does try to hack America.
[03:52:53.099 --> 03:52:55.220]  America tries to hack Russia.
[03:52:55.220 --> 03:52:57.640]  America tries to hack Israel.
[03:52:57.640 --> 03:52:59.481]  Israel tries to hack America.
[03:53:00.314 --> 03:53:06.542]  Allies hack each other to let each other know about open holes in their firewall.
[03:53:06.542 --> 03:53:08.344]  It's a common practice.
[03:53:08.344 --> 03:53:12.329]  Here in Silicon Valley, where I'm at, it is a common practice.
[03:53:12.329 --> 03:53:14.652]  They hack each other to find different things.
[03:53:14.652 --> 03:53:18.196]  And that's one way that allies help each other throughout the world.
[03:53:18.812 --> 03:53:20.774]  Doesn't mean that the enemies don't do it.
[03:53:20.774 --> 03:53:28.940]  And one thing they're talking about saying, you know, even Lindsey Graham said today that is show proof that Russia hacked the DNC.
[03:53:28.940 --> 03:53:39.369]  And my question to that would be to Lindsey Graham is when the FBI went to the DNC, was the FBI actually able to see the servers that were hacked?
[03:53:39.369 --> 03:53:44.973]  Because the last time I looked, the DNC refused to allow the FBI to view the servers.
[03:53:44.973 --> 03:53:46.975]  It's a valid question.
[03:53:46.975 --> 03:53:48.236]  To me, it's a valid question.
[03:53:48.815 --> 03:53:56.057]  They seem to forget about Seth Rich, you know, and they said that Roger Stone connection with WikiLeaks is his connection to Russia.
[03:53:56.057 --> 03:53:59.718]  I mean, seriously, you can say that about all of us.
[03:53:59.718 --> 03:54:03.079]  My connection to Russia is I'm on the same planet.
[03:54:03.079 --> 03:54:04.600]  I mean, really?
[03:54:04.600 --> 03:54:04.980]  Really?
[03:54:04.980 --> 03:54:08.981]  They make up everything out of everything.
[03:54:08.981 --> 03:54:13.042]  And the left, they're still so butthurt.
[03:54:13.931 --> 03:54:17.412]  That President Trump is still the president with no collusion.
[03:54:17.412 --> 03:54:19.253]  They don't know how to handle it.
[03:54:19.253 --> 03:54:22.094]  So I have another quick video that I'm going to share with you.
[03:54:22.094 --> 03:54:28.617]  And this is with our favorite person here in California, Maxine Waters.
[03:54:28.617 --> 03:54:29.918]  She is still losing it.
[03:54:29.918 --> 03:54:31.598]  She's completely losing it.
[03:54:31.598 --> 03:54:33.219]  Let's check this out really quick here.
[03:54:33.943 --> 03:54:36.324]  Maxine Waters, our favorite person.
[03:54:36.324 --> 03:54:42.047]  This president has a way of trying to get into people's heads and indoctrinate them.
[03:54:42.047 --> 03:54:47.951]  He's been saying no collusion, no collusion, no collusion over and over again for a long time now.
[03:54:47.951 --> 03:54:54.214]  And he's going to try and conclude that this report is proving that there's no collusion and
[03:54:54.494 --> 03:55:00.758]  You have a lot of his sycophants who will, you know, take the nod from him and they'll say the same thing.
[03:55:00.758 --> 03:55:03.900]  But we cannot allow them to get away with this.
[03:55:03.900 --> 03:55:06.021]  He does this all the time.
[03:55:06.021 --> 03:55:08.883]  This is not the end of anything.
[03:55:08.883 --> 03:55:14.287]  This is the, well, it's the end of the report and the investigation by Mueller.
[03:55:14.287 --> 03:55:20.411]  But those of us who chair these committees have a responsibility to continue with our oversight.
[03:55:21.787 --> 03:55:25.950]  There's so much that needs to be done.
[03:55:25.950 --> 03:55:28.952]  It's the end of the Democrats is what it is.
[03:55:28.952 --> 03:55:30.393]  It's the end of the Democrats.
[03:55:30.393 --> 03:55:31.334]  They're done.
[03:55:31.334 --> 03:55:36.478]  It should be the end of CNN, MSNBC, and the rest of them.
[03:55:36.478 --> 03:55:40.361]  For two years they pushed this fake news over and over.
[03:55:40.361 --> 03:55:42.923]  It should be the end of the left.
[03:55:44.315 --> 03:55:48.457]  If you ask me, the Democrats have played too many cards.
[03:55:48.457 --> 03:55:51.659]  They got caught with too many cards up their sleeve.
[03:55:51.659 --> 03:55:52.400]  Cheating.
[03:55:52.400 --> 03:55:54.601]  Lying.
[03:55:54.601 --> 03:55:56.242]  They colluded with Russia.
[03:55:56.242 --> 03:55:58.163]  Not President Trump.
[03:55:58.163 --> 03:55:59.684]  They're done.
[03:55:59.684 --> 03:56:00.404]  It's finished.
[03:56:00.404 --> 03:56:02.865]  They're finished.
[03:56:02.865 --> 03:56:07.468]  We're going to drill this horse until the horse can't even be drilled any longer.
[03:56:07.468 --> 03:56:08.749]  The dead horse.
[03:56:08.749 --> 03:56:10.870]  Because the Russia collusion is dead.
[03:56:10.870 --> 03:56:11.630]  It's over.
[03:56:11.630 --> 03:56:13.251]  And people need to recognize what happened.
[03:56:14.221 --> 03:56:23.743]  So like I said in the beginning of this, there's one other thing that I think we should be addressing, and it should be all over the news, but because of the whole Russia collusion thing is shadowing.
[03:56:23.743 --> 03:56:27.864]  And that is the interview with Alex Jones and Joe Rogan.
[03:56:27.864 --> 03:56:33.445]  It's so important that everyone views that video.
[03:56:33.445 --> 03:56:35.945]  You share that video.
[03:56:35.945 --> 03:56:37.205]  Go to the Infowars.com.
[03:56:37.205 --> 03:56:38.506]  It's on the main page.
[03:56:38.506 --> 03:56:39.766]  You can see it right there.
[03:56:40.419 --> 03:56:42.681]  You have to share that video.
[03:56:42.681 --> 03:56:50.346]  See, with all the censorship that's going on, they do not want us to pay attention to the real issues that's affecting all of us.
[03:56:50.346 --> 03:56:52.848]  This Russia collusion is not even a real issue.
[03:56:52.848 --> 03:56:56.310]  The real issue is how they're censoring Americans.
[03:56:56.870 --> 03:57:04.852]  If they truly cared about Americans, they would spend 100% drilling down the censorship that's taking place in America.
[03:57:04.852 --> 03:57:06.913]  It's Nazi Germany all over again.
[03:57:06.913 --> 03:57:10.854]  It's that for physical books, they are burning digital books.
[03:57:10.854 --> 03:57:14.614]  It's digital books that they're burning here in the United States.
[03:57:14.614 --> 03:57:16.375]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:57:16.375 --> 03:57:18.575]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:18.575 --> 03:57:22.116]  So much information, there's never enough time to get it all out.
[03:57:22.116 --> 03:57:24.897]  Coming up next is the War Room with Owen Schroeder.
[03:57:25.652 --> 03:57:27.293]  You got to stay tuned.
[03:57:27.293 --> 03:57:30.094]  He's going to be full of information as he always is.
[03:57:30.094 --> 03:57:31.054]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:57:31.054 --> 03:57:34.256]  Go to uniteamericafirst.com and check me out.
[03:57:34.256 --> 03:57:34.976]  God bless you.
[03:57:34.976 --> 03:57:37.777]  God bless America and God bless our president.
[03:57:37.777 --> 03:57:43.379]  Infowars.com.
[03:57:43.379 --> 03:57:51.203]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[03:57:51.203 --> 03:57:53.924]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[03:57:54.537 --> 03:57:57.620]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[03:57:57.620 --> 03:57:59.182]  I didn't invent all this.
[03:57:59.182 --> 03:58:05.748]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[03:58:05.748 --> 03:58:08.531]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[03:58:09.568 --> 03:58:12.931]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[03:58:12.931 --> 03:58:15.854]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[03:58:15.854 --> 03:58:17.576]  That sends chills up my spine.
[03:58:17.576 --> 03:58:31.110]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
