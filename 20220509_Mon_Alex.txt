[00:00.000 --> 00:11.720]  Terrorists in the U.S. say they are seeing increasing numbers of patients with what they
[00:11.720 --> 00:22.240]  call Donald Trump anxiety disorder. Trump anxiety disorder. Trump derangement syndrome.
[00:22.240 --> 00:27.600]  Trump derangement syndrome is clinically real. It doesn't merely affect individuals, but
[00:27.600 --> 00:31.680]  entire political parties rendering them unrecognizable.
[00:31.680 --> 00:39.200]  One minute, they're perfectly normal. The next, rapid.
[00:39.200 --> 00:45.480]  The veneer of civilization is evaporating quickly. Families and culture are collapsing.
[00:45.480 --> 00:53.280]  And godless leftists are behaving just like zombies of modern law.
[00:53.280 --> 00:58.560]  You can't trust your mother. Get the hell out of here. Get the fuck out of here. Your best
[00:58.560 --> 01:03.080]  friend. I get that camera out of my face. The neighbor next door.
[01:03.080 --> 01:08.160]  Psychologist Dr. Stuart Bassman says for his clients, it started the morning after the
[01:08.160 --> 01:11.320]  election. Doctors are seeing patients suffering from
[01:11.320 --> 01:14.920]  Trump anxiety disorder. The number of people are manifesting what
[01:14.920 --> 01:22.080]  I would call post-traumatic stress disorder. An overpowering fear that President Trump
[01:22.080 --> 01:36.040]  represents the end of the world. Pray, it doesn't happen to you.
[01:36.040 --> 02:00.280]  I'll wipe my nails.
[02:00.280 --> 02:20.280]  Certainly, for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive, but if you can get through all
[02:20.280 --> 02:26.280]  that to explore what he has been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment
[02:26.280 --> 02:32.280]  wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[02:32.280 --> 02:35.280]  He predicted 9-11.
[02:35.280 --> 02:39.280]  And if there was an outside threat like a bin Laden, who was a known CIA asset in the 80s,
[02:39.280 --> 02:41.280]  he's the boogeyman they need.
[02:41.280 --> 02:43.280]  And this were a welly and phony system.
[02:43.280 --> 02:47.280]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[02:47.280 --> 02:59.280]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalism,
[02:59.280 --> 03:03.280]  prison-planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks.
[03:03.280 --> 03:06.280]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg group at all.
[03:06.280 --> 03:10.280]  And most of you are about to stink in Paris!
[03:10.280 --> 03:18.280]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[03:18.280 --> 03:22.280]  They falsely edited him.
[03:22.280 --> 03:26.280]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[03:26.280 --> 03:32.280]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[03:32.280 --> 03:38.280]  And now he is being de-platformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[03:38.280 --> 03:43.280]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[03:43.280 --> 03:46.280]  And then we get hit, say, even no longer use our software.
[03:46.280 --> 03:50.280]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[03:50.280 --> 03:53.280]  We just got taken down by YouTube. They just killed our stream.
[03:53.280 --> 03:55.280]  Really? Yep.
[03:55.280 --> 03:58.280]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[03:58.280 --> 04:02.280]  This is America in 2018.
[04:02.280 --> 04:10.280]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[04:10.280 --> 04:15.280]  Will you do nothing while history is being recorded?
[04:15.280 --> 04:18.280]  Will you sit and do nothing?
[04:18.280 --> 04:25.280]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[04:25.280 --> 04:33.280]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[04:33.280 --> 04:36.280]  My friends, it's Monday, May 9th.
[04:36.280 --> 04:39.280]  The year is 2022.
[04:39.280 --> 04:41.280]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[04:41.280 --> 04:43.280]  We got a really big broadcast lined up for you today.
[04:43.280 --> 04:46.280]  And I had some guests, but I want to cancel them or move them,
[04:46.280 --> 04:50.280]  because I want to take a lot of calls today on a host of big issues, obviously.
[04:50.280 --> 04:54.280]  The economy, the globalist assaults, the new lockdowns they're preparing,
[04:54.280 --> 04:58.280]  the U.N. taking over all the major healthcare and more.
[05:25.280 --> 05:29.280]  On hundreds and hundreds of his made in America products,
[05:29.280 --> 05:35.280]  from pillows to sheets to shoes to human beds to dog beds, you name it.
[05:35.280 --> 05:41.280]  Go there, get great products at low prices, funding in full war, a true 360 win.
[05:41.280 --> 05:47.280]  MyPillow.com, Ford slash Alex, or 800-675-4614.
[05:47.280 --> 05:55.280]  It's only running for one week, MyPillow.com, Ford slash Alex, or 800-675-4614.
[05:55.280 --> 06:21.280]  And thank you for shopping America and keeping us on the year.
[06:25.280 --> 06:30.280]  Well, there's no doubt, ladies and gentlemen,
[06:30.280 --> 06:34.280]  that we are on the very front lines in the fight for a human future
[06:34.280 --> 06:36.280]  against the transhumanist technocrats.
[06:36.280 --> 06:41.280]  I have more videos and more statements calling for world government,
[06:41.280 --> 06:46.280]  calling for the U.N. and proud corporations to control every facet of your body
[06:46.280 --> 06:48.280]  and your medical life.
[06:48.280 --> 06:53.280]  We have major publications in the U.K. saying it's time to publish Britain's
[06:53.280 --> 06:56.280]  5 million vaccine refusenics.
[06:56.280 --> 07:04.280]  It's time to punish Britain's 5 million vaccine refusenics.
[07:04.280 --> 07:12.280]  It's really incredible times to be alive and to have this type of stuff unfolding.
[07:12.280 --> 07:20.280]  And it really shows the type of authoritarian future that we are already living in.
[07:20.280 --> 07:26.280]  This is no longer near future.
[07:26.280 --> 07:30.280]  This is happening now.
[07:30.280 --> 07:36.280]  We have Yuval Noah Harari saying this is the end of democracy, a new clip.
[07:36.280 --> 07:39.280]  The end of free will, the end of the free market, as you know it,
[07:39.280 --> 07:41.280]  just prepare to be a slave.
[07:41.280 --> 07:48.280]  And actually they celebrate as the futurist at the Davos Group.
[07:48.280 --> 07:53.280]  And there's lots of videos coming out of Switzerland right now where they're all
[07:53.280 --> 07:58.280]  meeting on a mountaintop with the World Economic Forum and the U.N.
[07:58.280 --> 08:01.280]  signing an agreement last week that basically the World Economic Forum
[08:01.280 --> 08:08.280]  or the public arm of the Bilderberg Group now publicly directs the United Nations.
[08:08.280 --> 08:13.280]  There's a new revised WHO agreement that openly moves to give Bill Gates
[08:13.280 --> 08:20.280]  and the head of the World Health Organization de facto pandemic and surveillance
[08:20.280 --> 08:25.280]  and governing power of 198 member states in the event of the next pandemic.
[08:25.280 --> 08:28.280]  If that doesn't frighten you, I don't know what will,
[08:28.280 --> 08:34.280]  because Bill Gates has been rubbing his hands together saying the next virus will be much worse
[08:34.280 --> 08:39.280]  and you know he loves to brag about what he and his cohorts are doing to you.
[08:39.280 --> 08:45.280]  This is biological warfare against the people of the world.
[08:45.280 --> 08:51.280]  And we have a right and we have a duty to defend ourselves from this.
[08:51.280 --> 08:55.280]  The question is how do we do it without triggering a worldwide civil war,
[08:55.280 --> 08:59.280]  which they will also use to collapse civilization and cover up their bio attack.
[08:59.280 --> 09:05.280]  This has got to be done very, very delicately as they say.
[09:05.280 --> 09:09.280]  And the biggest part of that is awakening the human mind and psyche
[09:09.280 --> 09:13.280]  to these psychotic depopulations.
[09:13.280 --> 09:18.280]  Why do you think so many movies, including James Bond movies
[09:18.280 --> 09:23.280]  and the Kingsman and just countless others,
[09:23.280 --> 09:29.280]  Logan's Run, Zard Daws,
[09:29.280 --> 09:32.280]  there's so many,
[09:32.280 --> 09:36.280]  12 Monkeys, there's hundreds.
[09:36.280 --> 09:42.280]  Talk about global elites wanting to release a virus to depopulate you,
[09:42.280 --> 09:46.280]  because that's really their operating system and everybody in Hollywood knows it
[09:46.280 --> 09:50.280]  and if you want to be part of the club, you've got to go along with that idea
[09:50.280 --> 09:54.280]  so they tell you through the movies, but this isn't a 1960s movie
[09:54.280 --> 10:00.280]  or a 1970s movie or a 1980s movie or a movie in the 90s and the 2000s.
[10:00.280 --> 10:06.280]  This is the real planet that we live on
[10:06.280 --> 10:10.280]  and this is happening now.
[10:10.280 --> 10:15.280]  But the real model they're going to use for control over a city population
[10:15.280 --> 10:23.280]  is going to be a mix of Brave New World,
[10:23.280 --> 10:31.280]  THX 1138, 1984
[10:31.280 --> 10:36.280]  and, of course, Children of Men.
[10:36.280 --> 10:41.280]  If you haven't seen Children of Men, you'll need to see it.
[10:41.280 --> 10:44.280]  We're telling you exactly what they're going to do there.
[10:44.280 --> 10:50.280]  A chemical in the water supply that sterilizes you.
[10:50.280 --> 10:53.280]  But so that they can't pinpoint one thing,
[10:53.280 --> 10:56.280]  they hit you with chemicals in the water that sterilize a large percentage,
[10:56.280 --> 10:59.280]  injections that sterilize a large percentage,
[10:59.280 --> 11:02.280]  GMOs that sterilize,
[11:02.280 --> 11:06.280]  aluminum dioxide, aerosol spraying,
[11:06.280 --> 11:12.280]  and all of it is having the effect on fish and amphibians and mammals
[11:12.280 --> 11:18.280]  and on those that study ornithology will tell you the birds
[11:18.280 --> 11:22.280]  were their fertility's way down and their mutations are way up.
[11:22.280 --> 11:30.280]  And the same thing is happening when you go on a trip in the summer or in the spring
[11:30.280 --> 11:36.280]  and you live in places that have a lot of bugs like Minnesota or Texas or Florida.
[11:36.280 --> 11:41.280]  And just 25 years ago, when I would drive to our family ranch in East Texas
[11:41.280 --> 11:45.280]  in the spring or summer, I would have to pull over repeatedly
[11:45.280 --> 11:50.280]  and get a squeegee at a gas station in a three and a half hour trip
[11:50.280 --> 11:56.280]  and squeegee dead bugs off or they would harden like hardened egg
[11:56.280 --> 11:59.280]  if you leave it in the bottom of a plate, you know how hard it is to get out.
[11:59.280 --> 12:03.280]  They're guts would harden on the windshield.
[12:03.280 --> 12:09.280]  Now, I can drive in the spring or summer in Texas
[12:09.280 --> 12:14.280]  and there might be one bug on my windshield.
[12:14.280 --> 12:16.280]  One bug.
[12:16.280 --> 12:21.280]  Remember, you're old enough to remember if you're more than 30, 40 years old
[12:21.280 --> 12:25.280]  and we're driving just 25 years ago, it all started about 25 years ago.
[12:25.280 --> 12:32.280]  Remember though, the grill of your truck would just be full of just bugs, piles of them
[12:32.280 --> 12:36.280]  that put gloves on and get them out of there.
[12:36.280 --> 12:39.280]  Not anymore.
[12:39.280 --> 12:44.280]  I want to ask ourselves why that's happening and in this is the key to everything.
[12:44.280 --> 12:48.280]  The globalists are not just killing off the humans.
[12:48.280 --> 12:51.280]  They have a plan to overwrite all life on Earth
[12:51.280 --> 12:54.280]  and create a new silicon life form that will live on this planet.
[12:54.280 --> 12:58.280]  Now, you can say it's an alien takeover.
[12:58.280 --> 13:01.280]  You can call it whatever you want.
[13:01.280 --> 13:03.280]  I don't know who's running it.
[13:03.280 --> 13:06.280]  I don't know if it's a species.
[13:06.280 --> 13:10.280]  I'm not debating all that. I'm saying you can extrapolate out logically
[13:10.280 --> 13:13.280]  and listen to all the globalists saying humans are bad.
[13:13.280 --> 13:15.280]  We're going to get rid of humans, post-human world.
[13:15.280 --> 13:17.280]  Looking forward to the end of humans.
[13:17.280 --> 13:19.280]  There'll be no more humans in 2045.
[13:19.280 --> 13:21.280]  We're going to depopulate the Earth by 2030
[13:21.280 --> 13:23.280]  and we're going to become gods and marginal machines.
[13:23.280 --> 13:29.280]  They believe they're the aliens.
[13:29.280 --> 13:31.280]  So I cover all this other news and I will.
[13:31.280 --> 13:33.280]  The war in Ukraine escalating out of control
[13:33.280 --> 13:36.280]  and the suppression of necessities is filmed.
[13:36.280 --> 13:39.280]  2,000 mules that totally proves how they carried out the election.
[13:39.280 --> 13:41.280]  Fraud.
[13:41.280 --> 13:43.280]  And so much more today.
[13:43.280 --> 13:49.280]  And we're going to take phone calls throughout the four hours.
[13:49.280 --> 13:55.280]  But you've got to read the Bible about a fallen entity on the planet that's eternal
[13:55.280 --> 14:00.280]  that hates us because we're related to the all-powerful omnipresent being
[14:00.280 --> 14:05.280]  that marooned it here and it is angry at us
[14:05.280 --> 14:08.280]  and it is attacking us and manipulating us
[14:08.280 --> 14:12.280]  and trying to get us to give up our humanity and give up our souls.
[14:12.280 --> 14:15.280]  And you can look back and say, well, that's just a book in the Bible
[14:15.280 --> 14:19.280]  that predicted a world government with 10 kingdoms and flying ships
[14:19.280 --> 14:24.280]  and just everything you see and a mark in the hand
[14:24.280 --> 14:27.280]  and forehead to buy and sell and the breakup of the family
[14:27.280 --> 14:33.280]  and everything that's happening exactly as it's happening.
[14:33.280 --> 14:39.280]  I sat there in the 1980s going to evangelical church and Baptist churches
[14:39.280 --> 14:41.280]  and you name it, my parents.
[14:41.280 --> 14:45.280]  And I remember seeing the preachers sit up there and give two-hour sermons
[14:45.280 --> 14:53.280]  word for word what is now unfolding.
[14:53.280 --> 14:56.280]  And then you got this, Houston Chronicle.
[14:56.280 --> 15:01.280]  NASA wants to send nudes to space in order to attract aliens.
[15:01.280 --> 15:04.280]  They've already been doing it, beaming out images of naked humans
[15:04.280 --> 15:07.280]  and our DNA sequence.
[15:07.280 --> 15:13.280]  What do you like, trying to send out the menu or whatever?
[15:13.280 --> 15:18.280]  So see, the globalists have got their whole world
[15:18.280 --> 15:21.280]  and how they believe they're mad scientists who will become gods
[15:21.280 --> 15:28.280]  and we're down here watching sitcoms designed to dumb us down
[15:28.280 --> 15:32.280]  and watching sports and I'm not judging if you do, hell, I've done it myself
[15:32.280 --> 15:36.280]  but it's still at the end of the day is a distraction from the real mystery
[15:36.280 --> 15:39.280]  of this planet and what we're doing here and what we're meant to be
[15:39.280 --> 15:44.280]  and what we're meant to do and the fact that we were given a cheat sheet
[15:44.280 --> 15:48.280]  on how to survive this and thrive in this and transcend it.
[15:48.280 --> 15:51.280]  We've got a huge broadcast, I'm going to give the number down next segment.
[15:51.280 --> 15:55.280]  I'm taking 100 phone calls today, infowars.com.
[15:55.280 --> 16:24.280]  Let's have a look at the sphere.
[16:25.280 --> 16:28.280]  There are hundreds and hundreds of us made in America products
[16:28.280 --> 16:33.280]  from pillows to sheets to shoes to human beds to dog beds.
[16:33.280 --> 16:37.280]  You name it, go there, get great products at low prices,
[16:37.280 --> 16:40.280]  funding info or a true 360 win.
[16:40.280 --> 16:46.280]  MyPillow.com, Ford slash Alex or 800-675-4614.
[16:46.280 --> 16:48.280]  It's only running for one week.
[16:48.280 --> 16:54.280]  MyPillow.com, Ford slash Alex or 800-675-4614.
[16:54.280 --> 16:58.280]  And thank you for shopping America and keeping us on the year.
[17:24.280 --> 17:25.280]  It's a real hit.
[17:25.280 --> 17:26.280]  People love it.
[17:26.280 --> 17:27.280]  It's 24.95.
[17:27.280 --> 17:29.280]  Alex Jones is right on the front of the Red Thunderbolt
[17:29.280 --> 17:32.280]  and then again on the back, a big bold infowars.com.
[17:32.280 --> 17:34.280]  Exercise your First Amendment.
[17:34.280 --> 17:37.280]  Don't let the leftist and the globalist bully silence you
[17:37.280 --> 17:40.280]  and fund the info war at the same time.
[17:40.280 --> 17:42.280]  There is not a more politically incorrect shirt
[17:42.280 --> 17:46.280]  that sends a stronger message of freedom, resistance to the new world order
[17:46.280 --> 17:50.280]  than the Alex Jones was right shirt exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[17:50.280 --> 17:53.280]  And again, this shirt is limited edition as well.
[17:53.280 --> 17:57.280]  We're doing one more run and then no more infowarstore.com.
[17:57.280 --> 17:59.280]  Get yours today.
[17:59.280 --> 18:04.280]  The newest product from info wars life is now available exclusively at infowarstore.com.

[19:39.280 --> 19:42.280]  carbon tax, global warming, all of it.
[19:42.280 --> 19:46.280]  And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out
[19:46.280 --> 19:49.280]  unless everybody is silenced and gaslit.
[19:49.280 --> 19:53.280]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence
[19:53.280 --> 19:56.960]  why it's hard to share him Full Wars links and band up video links.
[19:56.960 --> 19:59.120]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[19:59.120 --> 20:26.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:26.720 --> 20:35.360]  Now you're standing there sometimes, you better listen, listen well.
[20:35.360 --> 20:43.520]  Hide what you have to hide, and tell me what you have to tell me tonight.
[20:43.520 --> 20:45.920]  You'll see your problems.
[20:45.920 --> 20:51.520]  All right I want to get into the unbelievable
[20:51.520 --> 20:57.120]  situation that is deteriorating quickly in Ukraine.
[20:58.480 --> 21:01.920]  I want to get into the Dow Jones plunging over 300 points what's happening in crypto.
[21:03.200 --> 21:06.960]  I want to get into Bill Gates not just announcing that you're going to drink
[21:06.960 --> 21:11.760]  sewage water and eat bugs, but now he's got synthetic lab grown
[21:13.520 --> 21:14.400]  milk for babies.
[21:14.400 --> 21:15.840]  Wait to hear about the tales of that.
[21:15.840 --> 21:22.640]  Also massive electricity shortages in Europe and the US and their answer is shut down more of the
[21:22.640 --> 21:30.480]  plants that supply the electricity while forcing us off oil, but also not letting us have enough
[21:30.480 --> 21:36.640]  electricity from other sources while pushing people on their electric cars.
[21:37.360 --> 21:42.480]  We've got all of that coming up today and more.
[21:42.480 --> 21:49.600]  But the first thing I want to hit is this because it's really important to you and
[21:49.600 --> 21:52.000]  myself and everybody, but particularly in full wars.
[21:56.080 --> 22:02.640]  We've talked to a lot of the lawyers that are representing January 6th political presidents.
[22:03.440 --> 22:08.240]  Almost all of them are just completely innocent of anything.
[22:08.240 --> 22:13.280]  And then those that are guilty are just guilty of going into a building and maybe getting in
[22:13.280 --> 22:14.560]  a shoving match with the police.
[22:18.080 --> 22:24.000]  But having that knowledge, but also researching this on a daily basis and having my background
[22:24.000 --> 22:30.320]  knowledge on the deep state and knowing that the same FBI provocateur false flag team that ran the
[22:30.320 --> 22:35.440]  fake Whitmer kidnapping operation that was then transferred to run January 6th, we know that thing
[22:35.440 --> 22:41.280]  was a giant honeypot that we were all lured into that the Capitol Police were ordered to stand down
[22:41.280 --> 22:43.440]  that half their numbers were sent away that day.
[22:43.440 --> 22:46.720]  The Trump's request for 10,000 National Guard was refused.
[22:46.720 --> 22:50.160]  He could have overridden it, but Millie threatened to quit if he did.
[22:55.360 --> 22:59.680]  And so now we know it's really important because they are running on it
[22:59.680 --> 23:04.080]  in the midterms in 183 days.
[23:05.920 --> 23:11.440]  Washington Post articles, Wall Street Journal articles, New York Times articles this weekend
[23:12.400 --> 23:20.800]  that specifically say the committee is honing in on Roger Stone and Alex Jones for working
[23:20.800 --> 23:30.000]  with Trump and directing people to attack the Capitol. 100% BS. A, we don't have a motive,
[23:30.000 --> 23:34.720]  it made us look like fools. B, there's no evidence of it because it's not true.
[23:36.080 --> 23:42.160]  And C, I wasn't talking to President Trump for over a year before that ever happened and Roger
[23:42.160 --> 23:51.600]  Stone was not involved in any of the planning of even our legal lawful events on the 5th or the 6th.
[23:52.880 --> 23:56.320]  It's just incredible that they're trying to demonize lawful
[23:57.280 --> 24:02.000]  First Amendment activities and then I see the same headlines everywhere they've run against me.
[24:03.440 --> 24:09.360]  Oathkeepers are talking to prosecutors and they're exposing their communications
[24:09.360 --> 24:14.880]  and it's going to go all the way up to Trump. They might as well say they're communications with
[24:14.880 --> 24:22.800]  the Martians and then I know the individuals that they're talking about because I've seen them in
[24:22.800 --> 24:29.040]  the press. I've met some of them and I like oathkeepers overall that they had a good mission
[24:30.160 --> 24:34.160]  to promote following your oath and they did great work for over a decade. I think some bad
[24:34.160 --> 24:37.760]  things happened on January 6th. We're not sure all the specifics but we know it was a honey pot
[24:37.760 --> 24:44.240]  if I could turn but I know some of the people they're quoting here as
[24:47.040 --> 24:50.880]  saying they're talking to the feds and they're going to expose the chain of command
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.760]  and I just find it hard to believe that those people would actually make stuff up and lie.
[24:59.600 --> 25:04.640]  But I'm not worried about it because I didn't do anything wrong but it is in hundreds of
[25:04.640 --> 25:09.760]  publications a week conservatively it's on national tv every day on one channel or another
[25:10.960 --> 25:17.520]  that I'm going to jail and Roger Stone's going to jail and all the rest of this and it is a bizarre
[25:17.520 --> 25:25.360]  feeling to know you did nothing wrong to know there's no evidence you did anything wrong to know
[25:25.360 --> 25:30.880]  that you had no motive and to know that you tried to stop what happened and quite frankly I'm not
[25:30.880 --> 25:36.640]  asking for a medal but everybody else just stood there and and the thousand undercover FBI agents
[25:36.640 --> 25:43.360]  and hostage rescue team people that were there on record sat there while I tried to stop what was
[25:43.360 --> 25:47.360]  happening when I got there in the middle of it and I did turn thousands away from going in and
[25:47.360 --> 25:54.800]  sat there with their thumbs in their mouths or worse and so it just it really infuriates me
[25:54.800 --> 26:01.200]  that they bear minimum neither was some groups planning to go in there and get somewhat violent
[26:02.400 --> 26:05.360]  Democrats do it all the time in other capitals but I agree it's not a good thing
[26:07.120 --> 26:10.720]  and the evidence is overwhelming went ahead and actually helped provocateur and get the whole
[26:10.720 --> 26:17.200]  thing started while they then watched me show up in the middle of it with my crew and get tear gas
[26:17.200 --> 26:26.720]  of distance and try to stop it and then they got the nerve not just at the January 6th committee
[26:26.720 --> 26:34.800]  but they got two different FBI just department teams they admitted this to us trying
[26:36.960 --> 26:39.360]  to make a fake case and indict me
[26:39.360 --> 26:50.320]  and then the cherry on top is they then leak through the press lies that oh I'm coming out
[26:50.320 --> 26:56.480]  of the dark I'm coming in out of the cold I'm gonna tell them everything I'm gonna rat Trump out
[26:56.480 --> 27:01.600]  and all this made up stuff because they were calling us over and over again for months asking
[27:01.600 --> 27:07.360]  us to come meet with them and I said no they said what are the what do we come to you I said well
[27:07.360 --> 27:13.040]  why don't you drop your fake charges and own shroyer why don't you give me written questions I
[27:13.040 --> 27:17.920]  have nothing to hide but I'm not going to get in a perjury trap where they get some lying stool
[27:17.920 --> 27:23.520]  pigeon to say I did one thing and then they say I lie when I'm not lying so they can indict me
[27:23.520 --> 27:28.880]  like Martha Stewart you think I'm stupid I mean I'm not that smart but I'm not an idiot you are a
[27:28.880 --> 27:35.200]  discredited government agency that ran fast and furious and shipped tens of thousands of guns
[27:35.200 --> 27:41.440]  into Mexico on record to blame the Second Amendment in America so now Mexico could sue gun makers
[27:41.440 --> 27:46.960]  what's they're doing and then a bunch of the guns got shipped to ISIS in al-Qaeda that's all come out
[27:51.040 --> 27:54.400]  yeah El Chapo's 50 Cal sold
[27:58.720 --> 28:03.840]  through that operation where the ATF falls flag I mean to try to list the crimes of this government
[28:03.840 --> 28:08.960]  and the criminals that have taken it over would take hours but it's just too rich it's just
[28:08.960 --> 28:15.280]  it's it's it's too much but here's why listeners need to care they're now saying
[28:16.320 --> 28:21.840]  the Justice Department and the Capitol Police that there are imminent terror attacks on Supreme
[28:21.840 --> 28:30.720]  Court justices and on and on members of Congress and on others while Democrats firebomb buildings
[28:30.720 --> 28:35.120]  and burn things down and attack things and beat people up and violently protest outside Supreme
[28:35.120 --> 28:41.840]  Court justice houses the corporate media and the government Gestapo the brown shirts the Victorian
[28:42.960 --> 28:47.360]  they are saying that we the people the populace are the ones that are going to be violent
[28:47.360 --> 28:54.080]  which again means they're priming the false flag false flag alert false flags we blame on patriots
[28:54.080 --> 29:05.680]  imminent here at info wars our slogan is tomorrow's news today whether it's politics or health

[34:14.800 --> 34:22.480]  for what is inside the system and what i would talk about that 25 years ago the media would say
[34:22.480 --> 34:27.920]  he's insane there's no such thing as a deep state there's no such thing as a stay behind network
[34:27.920 --> 34:34.640]  there's no such thing as any of this now today they have meetings on television on c span with
[34:34.640 --> 34:38.880]  brennan and clapper you remember those a few years ago they said trump will be gone
[34:39.920 --> 34:42.880]  we have the bureaucracy and we're gonna have a coup and removing
[34:45.520 --> 34:51.920]  and they were doing that to show their power and exercise their power for their gangs to encourage
[34:51.920 --> 34:59.600]  their gangs inside the government corporations and the judiciary and media to break the law to do
[34:59.600 --> 35:04.960]  whatever they wanted to leak information you name it and that's what you see now is populist and
[35:04.960 --> 35:12.960]  christians and conservatives aren't breaking the law we're not leaking information we are not doing
[35:12.960 --> 35:19.600]  dirty tricks and i'm not saying we should while they on the other side are doing anything and
[35:19.600 --> 35:24.800]  everything they want however they want and they never get in any trouble for it so
[35:25.600 --> 35:30.800]  how do we not sink to their level at the same time beat them we expose them and let people
[35:30.800 --> 35:35.120]  know the reason they're going bankrupt the reason their dollars devalued the reason their borders
[35:35.120 --> 35:39.760]  are wide open the reason there's all this pedophilia going on is because these are predatory
[35:39.760 --> 35:46.720]  very bad wicked people that want to crash the world economy 40 population and everything
[35:46.720 --> 35:53.120]  else horrible and evil they do that they enjoy is just part of the enjoyment of getting to where
[35:53.120 --> 35:58.960]  they're trying to go so getting back to where we are there's all these headlines everywhere
[35:59.920 --> 36:07.760]  oath keepers are talking to the feds oath keepers are discussing with the feds conversations with
[36:07.760 --> 36:14.480]  trump stuff like this when none of that happened none of that went on and then the controlled
[36:14.480 --> 36:23.760]  left goes look jones is protecting the dawn his mafia boss why he's saying they because it's a lie
[36:23.760 --> 36:31.040]  that's why i'm not protecting trump but if they're able to demonize and lie about trump they're
[36:31.040 --> 36:36.400]  going to be able to demonize the american people they're branding all demonstrating all protesting
[36:36.400 --> 36:45.280]  open borders gun control election fraud lockdowns forced injections as terrorists they're trying
[36:45.280 --> 36:52.640]  to brand all opposition in america as terrorism and really bring us into a full bore authoritarian
[36:52.640 --> 36:57.280]  top-down police state we aren't getting there we are deep inside of it now
[36:57.280 --> 37:04.960]  now complete with a ministry of truth with sensors and surveillance and all the controls
[37:06.320 --> 37:13.520]  when america does something it does it big and boy are we doing it big here so when i see these
[37:13.520 --> 37:23.760]  headlines i don't believe them now may there be some fake informants inside the oath keepers
[37:23.760 --> 37:30.640]  that were there all along that will now speak for the oath keepers and help direct them into
[37:30.640 --> 37:36.480]  their prison cells yes there's no doubt that's happening but i know when i see headlines that
[37:36.480 --> 37:46.400]  the oath keepers are running around lying about people i don't believe it and you know i don't
[37:46.400 --> 37:54.960]  believe it because the same media that's saying that says i called the feds a month ago and said
[37:54.960 --> 37:59.760]  i've got information but give me immunity and i'll tell you what really happened no they came to me
[37:59.760 --> 38:03.600]  and said we want to talk to you and i said give me total immunity so you can't make up stuff and
[38:03.600 --> 38:08.480]  charge me with perjury and we told them there is no information everything we've said is on record
[38:08.480 --> 38:17.040]  it's all been true it's all on video it's all transparent it's all first of all protected
[38:17.040 --> 38:27.040]  behavior you guys are disgraceful even following the orders to do this and their spin is alex
[38:27.040 --> 38:34.720]  jones called the feds and he wants to come tell them what really happened and then they have these
[38:34.720 --> 38:43.520]  maps they put out on tv that show trump up at the top and then meadow's under him and then other
[38:43.520 --> 38:47.920]  and then you know and then don jr and then roger stone and then me and it goes down and it's
[38:49.920 --> 38:55.840]  it's fiction just like it's fiction the oath keepers are a terrorist organization you know how
[38:55.840 --> 39:00.480]  many videos we have on man dot video that they'll take down off twitter or facebook or youtube because
[39:00.480 --> 39:07.120]  they don't want you know the truth in fact put it back up place of the oath keepers saving police
[39:07.120 --> 39:13.360]  and trying to stop people going in the building on january 6 we just had it on screen for tv viewers
[39:13.360 --> 39:21.520]  will put it back up for me i'll give it to radio clusters but the reason this is so important
[39:21.520 --> 39:34.400]  is because they are framing the american people just like they're framing the million people
[39:34.400 --> 39:40.480]  that came to dc as terrorists because maybe a couple hundred mainly provocateurs got in
[39:40.480 --> 39:45.440]  fist fights with the police and then the police opened the doors and based on that they're trying
[39:45.440 --> 39:53.200]  to roll out their literal reeducation camps and their patriot act for the american people and
[39:53.200 --> 40:00.320]  then that leads us to this obama's a g eric holder tells me that while he initially thought in
[40:00.320 --> 40:05.280]  dining former president trump would be too divisive he now thinks there is evidence enough that he
[40:05.280 --> 40:19.120]  should be held accountable for his role in january 6 and let's not forget who eric holder is he got
[40:19.120 --> 40:24.160]  caught running fast and furious hundreds of thousands of guns total into mexico to the drug
[40:24.160 --> 40:29.760]  cartels and to isaac and al qaeda that all came out the news and now he's climbed out from underneath
[40:29.760 --> 40:40.240]  the rock and is now saying we need to arrest the president even though he obstructed it
[40:40.240 --> 40:48.320]  and got caught lying and all of it came out now he wants to escalate the situation by arresting
[40:48.320 --> 40:54.480]  the real president that even the majority of democrats know really won the election you know
[40:54.480 --> 41:03.040]  take jill biden her husband supposedly got more votes anybody in u.s history 11 million more but
[41:03.040 --> 41:10.880]  she can only sell 240 books in the first week of her book coming up 240 something books
[41:13.360 --> 41:18.720]  oh but dot on trump could sell 10 million none of it's true and everybody knows it
[41:18.720 --> 41:25.760]  but here's uh the eric holder comment americ garland you mentioned he's now
[41:26.480 --> 41:31.360]  your old job as attorney general there have been critics of him who say that he isn't being
[41:31.360 --> 41:36.320]  aggressive enough around the prosecutions regarding january the sixth do you think that's right
[41:36.880 --> 41:41.920]  no one knows i mean you know i have great faith in america and in the people at the justice department
[41:42.720 --> 41:47.600]  we won't really know how aggressive they have been until they are before a camera and announcing a
[41:47.600 --> 41:52.400]  decision either to indict certain people or not indict certain people here's my prediction
[41:52.400 --> 41:57.280]  at some point people at the justice department perhaps that prosecutor in in atlanta are going
[41:57.280 --> 42:00.880]  to have to make a determination about whether or not they want to indict donald trump there's going
[42:00.880 --> 42:04.880]  to be i do it well i think there's going to be sufficient factual information and i think
[42:04.880 --> 42:09.120]  that there's going to be sufficient proof of intent and then the question becomes what's the
[42:09.120 --> 42:14.800]  impact of uh of such an indictment i will i'm an institutionalist my initial thought was not to indict
[42:14.800 --> 42:19.680]  the former president out of concern of what how divisive it would be but given what we have learned
[42:20.240 --> 42:25.200]  i think that he probably has to be held accountable what you have learned is that you guys were to
[42:25.200 --> 42:30.240]  stand down and provocateur the operation with the same fbi team that ran the fake wetmer kidnapping
[42:31.120 --> 42:35.840]  we know there was a thousand paramilitary fbi and auxiliaries in the crowd and you did nothing
[42:35.840 --> 42:39.840]  to help those police officers when they were outnumbered by the few hundred thugs
[42:39.840 --> 42:45.760]  your fingerprints are all over just like your fingerprints are all over oklahoma city
[42:45.760 --> 42:50.480]  and you got caught red-handed and fast and furious you're a terrorist you're a criminal
[42:50.480 --> 42:55.920]  you're an enemy of this country eric holder and you will pay when you are judged by god

[43:59.200 --> 44:05.040]  the eugenicist over 100 years ago were very public about their plans they financed major
[44:05.040 --> 44:10.720]  universities they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of
[44:10.720 --> 44:15.440]  the new york times other major newspapers that the family as we know it is a bad thing
[44:16.080 --> 44:21.040]  and must be ended and the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching
[44:21.600 --> 44:26.960]  women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing
[44:26.960 --> 44:31.920]  and i was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter my four natural daughter my wife
[44:31.920 --> 44:36.320]  makes dinner a lot of times but i like to make it as well i love to make breakfast and literally
[44:36.320 --> 44:42.000]  it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative and then all sit
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.920]  down together and have that communal event and that's what the system is attacking and bombarding
[44:47.920 --> 44:53.920]  is our normal biological actions are coming together they really are sick evil scientific
[44:53.920 --> 44:59.120]  cult of filth and domesticate us and turn us into lab rats that we cannot let this continue
[45:00.640 --> 45:10.160]  if i had to describe with just one word the brainwashing the mind control the asleep prince
[45:11.040 --> 45:18.320]  that the general public is in the best word would actually be the people are lost just like you're
[45:18.320 --> 45:24.320]  lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare you're in a car he get knocked out and you've lost
[45:25.040 --> 45:31.440]  your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused you have a concussion
[45:32.160 --> 45:37.120]  and that's what the globalists have done they have stunned us they have put us into a position
[45:37.120 --> 45:41.360]  of not knowing our bearings and then claus Schwab recently came out and gave speech he called the
[45:41.360 --> 45:46.240]  great new narrative where he brags how the public is lost how the culture in the media
[45:46.240 --> 45:51.440]  has been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the
[45:51.440 --> 45:56.880]  edge of a cliff that's what the great reset is they need darkness to thrive the light lives

[46:52.800 --> 47:07.280]  salute you and thank you leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[47:07.280 --> 47:27.520]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[47:37.600 --> 47:49.200]  the letter from albert pike regarding the illuminati plan for three world wars is largely
[47:49.200 --> 47:57.840]  considered a hoax due to the use of the word nazism in a letter dated 1871 but it is interesting to
[47:57.840 --> 48:04.480]  note the desired outcome of this alleged plan according to the letter the third war officially
[48:04.480 --> 48:10.480]  started on 9 11 and was intended to leave the people in a state of complete physical
[48:10.480 --> 48:18.880]  moral spiritual and economic exhaustion they will then use nihilists atheists and revolutionaries
[48:18.880 --> 48:25.760]  to create a cataclysm of social turmoil and they will do this in order to force the people
[48:25.760 --> 48:33.040]  into exterminating the destroyers of civilization according to this letter this bloodbath would
[48:33.040 --> 48:39.360]  result in the destruction of both christianity and atheism and lead to the pure doctrine of
[48:39.360 --> 48:46.960]  lucifer as the new world religion and it does appear as if this is happening now as if the
[48:46.960 --> 48:53.040]  powers that be are pushing the people into a desperate corner as if their main goal is to
[48:53.040 --> 49:00.240]  create mass chaos and violence but they've been doing this all by decree because they have no
[49:00.240 --> 49:06.800]  authority over god or the us constitution and so they'd be thrilled if we burn it all down for them
[49:06.800 --> 49:12.720]  proving we are inferior savages in need of governance they thought they'd have that on
[49:12.720 --> 49:20.160]  january 6th but the people were there for peace love and justice not a revolution we don't need
[49:20.160 --> 49:27.840]  one we already have our declaration of independence but without justice the death cult remains free
[49:27.840 --> 49:35.680]  and continues on its path to kill us all they're going to shut us down again but this time the
[49:35.680 --> 49:41.360]  united nations will be in charge our government is giving them that authority at the end of this
[49:41.360 --> 49:47.840]  month just in time for the next international health crisis and with the leaked supreme court
[49:47.840 --> 49:55.040]  memo on roe v wade they can launch endless organized riots on us while we remain locked in our homes
[49:55.040 --> 50:01.760]  round two is coming and this time with food shortages and the crashing dollar
[50:03.280 --> 50:07.280]  but it doesn't have to be like this their authority is the biggest
[50:07.280 --> 50:13.360]  psi up ever you are not their slave unless you choose to be they are convincing you to do this to
[50:13.360 --> 50:20.880]  yourself when they demanded that everyone wear a mask in 2020 the majority of us could have said no
[50:20.880 --> 50:28.640]  demanded justice and the true renaissance would have then begun the 2020 lockdown was a beta test
[50:28.640 --> 50:35.520]  to gauge how compliant the population was and we failed but we will soon have another chance
[50:35.520 --> 50:43.280]  and 2020 was also a wake-up call for millions of americans and millions worldwide who previously
[50:43.280 --> 50:51.760]  had no idea how corrupt our governments had become so now we are many and we must all prepare for
[50:51.760 --> 51:01.280]  the next lockdown and we must remember that we are not savages sheep or slaves we are human
[51:01.280 --> 51:09.760]  beings with free will and as lawful americans it is our responsibility to apprehend these traders
[51:09.760 --> 51:20.080]  exact justice and restore the republic but first we must simply say no say no to the masks say no
[51:20.080 --> 51:27.600]  to sheltering in place say no to vaccine passports say no to shutting down your business or your church
[51:27.600 --> 51:34.480]  and if the police come to shut you down make them commit treason the law of the land is already in
[51:34.480 --> 51:42.480]  the hands of the people all we have to do is wake up and take it back together peace love and justice
[51:42.480 --> 51:48.800]  is ours if we want it reporting for info wars this is greg reese
[51:52.880 --> 51:57.280]  all right i'm going to tell you exactly what's going on and it's it's not my opinion we know
[51:57.280 --> 52:06.880]  um i believe john roberts is the one that leaked the draft we know he's compromised in blackmailed
[52:06.880 --> 52:12.640]  and basically a deep stator democrat posing as a republican we know that since february of last
[52:12.640 --> 52:18.160]  year it's come out he's sat on the supreme court ruling using the power of his chief justice to
[52:18.160 --> 52:25.280]  block the court from ruling they began to get very upset about it the last year and so now it's
[52:25.280 --> 52:30.400]  been leaked to not make americans come together against the mass mandates the force injections the
[52:30.400 --> 52:34.880]  open borders and the inflation and the wars and the pedophilia and all the rest of it
[52:36.560 --> 52:40.000]  but to make everybody fight going into the election about abortion
[52:42.080 --> 52:46.240]  which is just going to be given back to the states to deal with anyways doesn't even get rid of it
[52:46.880 --> 52:52.160]  though it does curtail it and is a constitutional move and if i had a suspect it would be him his
[52:52.160 --> 52:57.840]  minions and now he's the one of course running the investigation just like fouchy launched
[52:57.840 --> 53:01.840]  with bill gates and peter dazik the bio attack and then they're the ones in charge
[53:04.000 --> 53:11.520]  of the investigation and so that's where we are and the same people like eric holder and
[53:11.520 --> 53:16.080]  loretta lynch that all those corrupt evil things have one of their minions garland
[53:16.080 --> 53:23.680]  in there who will preside over making sure that federal law enforcement doesn't get in the way
[53:24.400 --> 53:31.840]  of the ongoing coup against the american people then the left on the ground will supply all the
[53:31.840 --> 53:37.120]  false flags and events they need the left will go out and fire bomb and attack and then that
[53:37.120 --> 53:42.000]  won't get covered in the press but then you have this coming out we're getting no national attention
[53:42.000 --> 53:47.920]  and portland journalists who reported on the alt right for liberal papers arrested over the tax
[53:48.480 --> 53:54.800]  on synagogues and mosque posing as you guessed it a drum supporter
[53:56.560 --> 54:04.720]  how many leftists have been caught doing this adam kevin julio evan justin carlos marcos
[54:04.720 --> 54:14.320]  kami forte rodney matt we're going to all your calls starting now adam you'll go to you next
[54:14.320 --> 54:22.320]  but first is kevin in south dakota says he was jan six was there in dc and the abortion topic go
[54:22.320 --> 54:28.000]  ahead hey alex i remember coming out on the fifth because i wanted to check to see that i'd have a
[54:28.000 --> 54:33.520]  route i thought antifa would intact us on our way back from the trump rally i thought i'll get a
[54:33.520 --> 54:40.240]  hotel three miles away and i came in the night before on the subway got off at the supreme court
[54:40.240 --> 54:45.840]  station and as i came out they cordoned off the area for two miles from the event the night before
[54:45.840 --> 54:51.920]  you couldn't even park nearby i heard echoing through the skyscrapers the dulcet tones of alex
[54:51.920 --> 54:57.520]  jones i heard you speaking down there at the uh freedom plaza and i went there and i saw you
[54:57.520 --> 55:03.680]  and roger stone and i was i was keyed up and then i went to the event on january six i saw two women
[55:03.680 --> 55:09.520]  pushing dogs and strollers i saw a man and his wife with a baby over the shoulder i saw a bunch of
[55:09.520 --> 55:15.200]  people dressed up like trump supporters who would cuss and yell and try and rile other people up
[55:15.200 --> 55:20.080]  and nothing would happen we'd all just kind of avoid them like well that that that's a crazy but
[55:20.080 --> 55:25.520]  we we love jesus in the country and trumpin and i saw people with gay gads and snake
[55:25.520 --> 55:30.080]  snake flags and people getting high it was like it was like conservative woodstock for goodness sake
[55:30.080 --> 55:34.080]  and they didn't plan for it and they had people on top of the porta potties and i had to climb a tree
[55:34.080 --> 55:40.160]  to see the overflow screen so i know that january six was a complete false flag operation designed
[55:40.160 --> 55:47.440]  to undermine the right for the purpose of giving the left a talking point and now we see a fodder
[55:47.440 --> 55:51.360]  for the election and now they're doing the same thing with the pro choice i got a death threat
[55:51.360 --> 55:58.640]  yesterday from some female to male who called me a scum expletive and told me to die and that they'd
[55:58.640 --> 56:03.280]  be willing to do it and that i need to be made an example of because i'm pro-life and i present my
[56:03.280 --> 56:10.080]  arguments clearly with proper information facts and i i cite it and they can't stand it because
[56:10.080 --> 56:15.360]  it's cognitive distance and they're brainwashed and they're the heroes so they're allowed to be
[56:15.360 --> 56:20.160]  violent and we see catholic churches churches being attacked everywhere i showed a bunch of videos of
[56:20.160 --> 56:25.600]  it last night the media acting like it's a good thing uh the white house president saying it's a
[56:25.600 --> 56:30.640]  good thing to docks and go harass supreme court justices of their homes this is a group of bullying
[56:30.640 --> 56:35.200]  terrorists with the whole corporate media and the federal government on their side they are the
[56:35.200 --> 56:39.680]  establishment we are the people and they were so scared of that diverse crowd of a million people
[56:39.680 --> 56:45.040]  that showed up with maybe a thousand provocateurs inside the whole crowd who then attacked the
[56:45.040 --> 56:53.200]  outman police while the fbi thousand fbi agents paramilitary shacked there in the crowd at the
[56:53.200 --> 56:59.920]  capital while i tried to stop it and did nothing shame on them great points god bless you kevin

[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:04.320]  20 conservative states are threatening legal action against the department of homeland
[1:00:04.320 --> 1:00:10.160]  securities newly formed disinformation governance board which they said will have a chilling effect
[1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:15.760]  on freedom of expression and described it as un-american unconstitutional would be the word
[1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:21.280]  i would use now the good news is is that almost all the big tech platforms now acknowledge some
[1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:26.720]  responsibility for content on their platforms and they're investing in large teams of people to
[1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:32.640]  monitor it while content moderation can limit the distribution of clearly dangerous content
[1:00:34.080 --> 1:00:38.800]  it doesn't go far enough this mega crowd is really the most extreme public
[1:00:38.800 --> 1:00:44.880]  organization that's existed in american history if it were that's it would merely be irony that the
[1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:51.600]  biden administration led by its chronic serial fabricator in chief is just gonna bypass that
[1:00:51.600 --> 1:00:57.840]  worthless old first amendment and set up an orwellian ministry of truth led by esteemed
[1:00:57.840 --> 1:01:04.720]  disinformation regurgitator nina jankowitz so what i'm encouraging individuals to do in particular
[1:01:04.720 --> 1:01:10.480]  uh just your normal average everyday citizen is to practice informational distancing where
[1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:17.280]  recognizing that disinformation and misinformation often run on emotional manipulation when you
[1:01:17.280 --> 1:01:22.800]  feel your emotions rising to just walk away from your device for a little bit uh let yourself
[1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:29.120]  cool down and then start to consider the source why does that particular source uh have an interest
[1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:34.240]  in emotionally manipulating you but we're gonna begin tonight with that alleged terror plot and
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:40.000]  the chilling plan the fbi says it stopped before it could be carried out a plan to kidnap michigan
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:45.440]  governor gretchen whitmer and then what they were planning to do to her 13 suspects arrested
[1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:50.320]  including seven alleged members of a right-wing militia group the local four defenders first
[1:01:50.320 --> 1:01:56.000]  told you the men charged in the plot the kidnap governor whitmer say the men who train them the
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:03.120]  entire time were undercover fbi agents now a new court filing obtained by the defenders
[1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:10.640]  filed by so-called ringleader adam vox says paid fbi informants were also the ones to come up with
[1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:17.280]  the plan to kidnap the governor and attack her summer home jankowitz has praised the debunked
[1:02:17.280 --> 1:02:23.680]  dossier author christopher steel and vehemently claim that the hunter biden laptop story was
[1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:30.480]  russian disinformation but jankowitz's manic zealotry is far more complicated than what appears on
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:44.320]  the surface jankowitz's resume reads like a quintessential job application to the biden
[1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:51.360]  ukrainian corruption corporation an organization hell bent on new world order russia regime change
[1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:58.240]  fueled by the fleecing of the american taxpayer in 2010 jankowitz attended a university in russia
[1:02:58.240 --> 1:03:05.040]  in 2017 she was a full bright fellow in kiv working alongside the foreign ministry of ukraine
[1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:12.160]  she has also served as a disinformation fellow at the treasonous woodrow wilson center and as
[1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:18.560]  supervisor of the russia and belarus programs at the national democratic institute republicans are
[1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:25.280]  criticizing your decision the administration's decision to choose nina jankowitz to lead this
[1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:31.680]  disinformation board they say she is not somebody who is neutral your response eminently qualified
[1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:37.760]  a renowned expert in the field of disinformation absolutely so
[1:03:37.760 --> 1:03:43.040]  is really quite ferocious it's when a hoax detects the lies and makes them sound precocious by saying
[1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:48.000]  them in congress or a mainstream outfit so disinformation's origins are slightly less
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:55.200]  atrocious when when the department picked her was the department aware of her tiktok videos
[1:03:56.800 --> 1:04:07.360]  senator um uh they're really quite precocious um senator um i was not uh aware uh of those videos
[1:04:07.360 --> 1:04:13.920]  and as the multi-millionaire wall street leaching democratic party eggs on world war three and funnels
[1:04:13.920 --> 1:04:21.520]  in billions of us taxpayer dollars to one of the most corrupt countries on earth ukraine corruption
[1:04:21.520 --> 1:04:27.840]  blatantly tied to the biden family jankowitz fronts an effort mirroring the totalitarianism
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:33.920]  being wielded on ukrainian dissenters an effort that would make the ukrainian gerbils worshiping
[1:04:33.920 --> 1:04:40.640]  azov battalion very proud ask yourself what is the end game for a ministry of truth no don't
[1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:51.200]  do that your door is being kicked in john bound reporting

[1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:19.200]  people you know who you are but we also have millions of people that just come through
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:24.000]  occasionally and listen to see what it's all about and what it's all about is the rest of
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:30.160]  your life and the rest of my life the globalists have decided to cut off the resources to the
[1:07:30.160 --> 1:07:36.000]  general public and to bring in a post industrial world to then force the population that's the
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:41.520]  state of gold and i've got more quotes from the debauch group and the un more video of them saying
[1:07:41.520 --> 1:07:48.640]  it yesterday and today while they meet in switzerland to decide the future of humanity
[1:07:51.280 --> 1:07:57.840]  and so this broadcast is really about getting people to become active in their futures
[1:07:57.840 --> 1:08:03.200]  and learning how the world really works and learning who the real power players are so
[1:08:03.200 --> 1:08:11.760]  we don't get run over by these corporate fascist and their leftist minions speaking of marjorie
[1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:17.760]  taylor green was called a big win friday afternoon when the judge said after putting her through the
[1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:24.160]  ringer that the democrat party lawsuit trying to block her from being able to run for office
[1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:32.160]  was unconstitutional she's not been charged with a crime she's done nothing wrong she won
[1:08:32.160 --> 1:08:38.240]  her last election in landslide she's an amazing lady of courage and intelligence has gone through
[1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:44.960]  a lot how can you bar somebody just because they wanted to challenge an election legally and lawfully
[1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:49.680]  something democrats do every time there's an election how can you do that so
[1:08:49.680 --> 1:09:00.480]  so how is it really a victory to say oh the judge said that she can run for office the judge
[1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:07.040]  shouldn't even have heard the case all the other cases brought against more than a dozen members
[1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:13.840]  of congress like gozer and others the judges said it's unconstitutional i'm not gonna hear it on
[1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:22.720]  its face if they were convicted felons then you can say they can't run and i think that's even
[1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:28.400]  unconstitutional i think once you've done your time you should be able to run for office but the
[1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:36.160]  idea of saying that conservatives and populist and christians and nationalists america firsters
[1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:42.480]  that we are trying to steal elections when the democrats are being constantly caught doing it
[1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:49.440]  amazing evidence in the nest of citizens who film 2000 mules while they're trying to block the public
[1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:54.720]  from being able to have the candidates of their choice to run the most fundamental
[1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:59.920]  assault on voting rights one could imagine all right we've got a lot of callers here start going
[1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:06.640]  to them right now adam in oklahoma has a question he says who is q would you like to elaborate on
[1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:13.040]  that and i'll tell you who q is okay yeah thank you alex i appreciate you take my call a few years
[1:10:13.040 --> 1:10:18.240]  ago you painted some broad brush strokes about who q was and how impossibly had exchanged hands and
[1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:23.360]  things like that and at one point you threatened that if they didn't come out and say who they were
[1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:28.000]  themselves that you were going to do it and you know i can't listen all the time but maybe you did
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:35.920]  cover it at some point but i never did hear names named about who q is well um i'm on record
[1:10:35.920 --> 1:10:44.160]  saying that q was lying that trump would be back in office on january 20th and right but you didn't
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:49.120]  you have names of who q is well let's let's let's just let me let me talk for a second okay
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:11:02.240]  q is such a horrible thing that i hate to even talk about it all right um q is anonymous so it's
[1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:06.720]  what people are calling and asking me who is the anonymous hacking group it's any group
[1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:15.200]  wants to call themselves anonymous it's the same thing with q it's called esoterica or occult occult
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:21.600]  means hidden when you see the movie eyes wide shut based on real things that went on when they go to
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:28.400]  the satanic orgy where the woman's killed you don't know who anyone is they're wearing mask
[1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:33.680]  so that's why historically people wearing masks generally aren't the good guys
[1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:42.400]  and so it's a tar baby because people love a puzzle they they love a scavenger hunt and
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:48.320]  they want to feel like they're part of something magic and secretly getting orders from president
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:52.720]  trump and then everything was fine and he was everybody was going to get arrested and trump
[1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:58.480]  was going to end up being emperor and everything was fine and it was all a delusion to make people
[1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:03.600]  think everything was okay so the democrats could steal the election and yes i do know what happened
[1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:09.760]  with q i do know who started it i do know what happened with it but no one wants the truth so
[1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:16.640]  i won't tell you how about that just what i mean what do you think it is uh tell you the truth i
[1:12:16.640 --> 1:12:23.440]  don't know i do think it's a sigh out for sure uh but it seems to me like it's just time to take the
[1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:29.280]  mask off the scuba commander if there is names to name that uh they they create this buggy man and
[1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:35.760]  if certainly if the uh government wanted to know who it was they would they would find out you know
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:42.400]  in days if they wanted to they don't they don't want to say it yeah um you know i'm in a unique
[1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:46.800]  position to know things a lot of people don't know and in many cases to protect the innocent
[1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:55.040]  i'm not going to say who started it but i can tell you they were only in control of it for about a
[1:12:55.040 --> 1:13:02.000]  month and then it got taken away by a bunch of disinfo experts and operatives um right out of the
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:09.040]  cia and that's a fact and i've got a track record of being accurate about that so here's what happened
[1:13:09.040 --> 1:13:17.520]  with q we were very successful exposing the child kidnapping ring satanism angle by the democratic
[1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:28.640]  party wiki leaks was very very successful at releasing real information remember that in the
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:34.640]  run up to the election 2016 hey someone on the inside was given out accurate information that's
[1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:38.960]  okay i'm gonna start over i'm gonna start over because the whole q thing we could talk for hours
[1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:44.400]  about this so this may take me a while to go over and i've got a little bit of a bug in my throat
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:51.440]  here sorry you know here's the thing about the q deal i lay out exactly what's going on and nobody
[1:13:51.440 --> 1:13:56.960]  cares every caller i talk to you like you and i'm not mad at you when i said her and i'm telling
[1:13:56.960 --> 1:14:02.240]  you specific stuff i said did you hear what i just said and he responded back with i know somebody
[1:14:02.240 --> 1:14:07.280]  was given out accurate information
[1:14:10.560 --> 1:14:16.320]  do i mean i mean look i love you adam did you hear what i just said in the lead up to that
[1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:20.400]  what did i say to you right before you responded back with a yeah i know somebody was given out
[1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:27.120]  that information okay i'm sorry i'm a little nervous i might have no no no it's okay it's okay
[1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:33.680]  you understand that we lost the cut free because of q yes sir and i have to put up with the q people
[1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:40.320]  all over the place and i'm tired of it so i'm not mad at you but you just hit a button here
[1:14:40.320 --> 1:14:45.040]  and the damn q people were the ones that manipulated some people to go into the damn capital and
[1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:52.000]  worked with the feds q is the worst people on earth at the top q is the new world order q is
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:56.960]  a psi op to lead us around by our noses i'm gonna put you on hold on to come back to you i'm gonna
[1:14:56.960 --> 1:15:06.640]  start over i may take the q shaman i know him i know filmmakers that know his family he's not
[1:15:06.640 --> 1:15:11.520]  a bad guy he's completely schizophrenic they know he's schizophrenic and they're sending him to jail
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:18.960]  for four years for doing nothing that's how sick and how painful all of this is and and in my
[1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:30.320]  frustration here's my frustration i can give you the emails and the documents and i've shut them
[1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:36.880]  on air probably 50 times where peter dazik and bill gates and the rest of these criminals

[1:20:31.600 --> 1:20:37.200]  we're showing some footage on the screen um some of the pro-abortion activists protesting outside

[1:20:44.480 --> 1:20:50.800]  all right getting serious thank you so much for joining us here on the alex jones show and i
[1:20:50.800 --> 1:20:58.160]  apologize to adam from oklahoma who asked a very reasonable question and i got angry because when i
[1:20:58.160 --> 1:21:02.320]  opened my brain up and start going back over what all the q stuff did it gives me a headache
[1:21:03.520 --> 1:21:08.640]  and the biggest frustration is i know exactly went on every damn angle of it would take hours to
[1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:18.400]  explain and people don't seem to care about real hardcore documents and so if you want to believe
[1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:23.920]  some nebulous thing knock yourselves out some nebulous thing that led the country into destruction
[1:21:23.920 --> 1:21:28.400]  and that lied to you at every turn and i'm not talking to adam who i'll go back to in a moment
[1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:36.960]  i'm talking to the nice people a lot of good people like mtg and general flinn and myself to
[1:21:36.960 --> 1:21:43.840]  a certain extent knew what was going on with the q thing and knew that there was a tug of war going
[1:21:43.840 --> 1:21:52.400]  on over this anonymous thing and so well let's just try to co-opt it away from the bad guys that
[1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:59.760]  are using it and use it for good and that's what general flinn tried to do okay had discussions
[1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:07.600]  with him about it and i told flinn he ought to just come out and say he's q so he could shut
[1:22:07.600 --> 1:22:14.960]  up all the dis info people and actually make q good it would be real if flinn let it and i'm not
[1:22:14.960 --> 1:22:22.080]  going to get into our off the record discussions but because q is so nebulous flinn wouldn't do that
[1:22:22.080 --> 1:22:30.800]  so i was working years ago trying to fix q and i'm going to explain this to you so i'm going to stop
[1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:43.120]  right here i inspired q paul joseph watson did info wars did in the election wiki leaks gave birth
[1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:49.680]  to q wiki leaks is real the pedophilia the child kidnapping rings that are in the emails
[1:22:49.680 --> 1:22:53.920]  with john podesta and all the rest of it and tony podesta that's all real
[1:22:56.240 --> 1:23:00.880]  so how do you counter something like that well they come out with saying it's really in a pizza
[1:23:00.880 --> 1:23:05.840]  place in dc not at farmhouses in new york and illinois and in california
[1:23:07.920 --> 1:23:11.680]  so they divert off onto the pizza place that did have a bunch of creepy weird stuff and did have
[1:23:11.680 --> 1:23:20.560]  some of the people involved in the tough going there and so you kill a real story
[1:23:23.040 --> 1:23:26.400]  with a fake story that discredits it
[1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:36.080]  and that's what's happened there and then a lot of patriots some in the trump administration
[1:23:36.080 --> 1:23:45.520]  and some in us intelligence saw that info wars got major heat for exposing the pedophile rings
[1:23:45.520 --> 1:23:54.000]  and jeffrey eppstein and they said let's do it anonymously and put out intel from our people
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:24:00.400]  inside the white house when trump first got elected and let's really energize the grass roots and
[1:24:00.400 --> 1:24:08.880]  have like a secret propaganda arm that tells the truth but releases stuff too hot to handle
[1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:14.800]  to the public and that was the consortium of people in the white house they tried to do
[1:24:14.800 --> 1:24:23.120]  what info wars does but not putting their name on it within a month it got taken away on the
[1:24:23.120 --> 1:24:30.080]  eight-chan and the four-chan boards by the other side i came out and said it's been compromised it's
[1:24:30.080 --> 1:24:36.800]  bad get away from it then a tug of war happened then big tech would let q information be promoted
[1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:41.840]  and pushed the top everywhere knowing that would make people get involved with it and think it was
[1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:48.320]  real and popular well we were all being suppressed then what if i warned people about the q movement
[1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:54.960]  being anonymous and dangerous people would think oh he's opposition to q and trump he's bad
[1:24:59.040 --> 1:25:02.800]  and then i explained that they were going to provocateur people i think they were part of
[1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:09.600]  secret missions for trump to do all sorts of weird violent things that happen in the u.s but thank
[1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:15.920]  god none of it ever really got big until january six and the majority of people that did go into
[1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:22.720]  the building of different organizations and groups individuals had the q propaganda background
[1:25:23.840 --> 1:25:28.320]  that there was going to be this big storm and this was the day of the takeover and it was all
[1:25:28.320 --> 1:25:34.880]  going to happen that day they were led and manipulated by the deep state
[1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:41.120]  that by then had taken over and if you want to understand how this works look up
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:46.800]  what happened in russia in the 1920s
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:55.280]  with movements that the russian intelligence communist agency set up to try to find out who
[1:25:55.280 --> 1:26:02.000]  all the opposition was in the country they created their own underground group
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  group which its slogan was trust the plan
[1:26:11.920 --> 1:26:17.600]  and they actually went on and led the opposition for several years and then tricked opposition
[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:22.880]  into going to carry out violence where they then caught them imprisoned them and executed them
[1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:34.160]  and so these programs have been before it was called operation trust the 100-year-old psi
[1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:42.320]  op repackage is q anon that's an excellent article on it q anon bears striking resemblance to bolshevik
[1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:51.760]  psi op from 1920s known as operation trust and so operation trust 2.0 everything the globalist
[1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:58.720]  does is bolshevik and style was carried out it's been carried out and now it's gotten so insane
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:06.880]  overhead shot please that in dallas and in vegas and in new york city and in la and in austin
[1:27:08.080 --> 1:27:14.240]  they have meetings sometimes with thousands usually hundreds of people that show up with flags
[1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:22.240]  saying trump jfk jr 2024 believing he's going to show up and then they'll just pick some random
[1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:28.880]  insane person out of the crowd and say it's jfk jr for tv viewers i'm showing you the image of
[1:27:28.880 --> 1:27:37.120]  what's probably 500 a thousand people in delhi plaza downtown dallas waiting for jfk jr to arrive
[1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:47.040]  and that is all the psi oppers literally testing the mind control they've got over these people and
[1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:52.720]  these people admit they're wrong they'll be free of this but they can't admit they're wrong because
[1:27:52.720 --> 1:28:00.880]  they're under stockholm syndrome and those very people think i'm bad because i told them january
[1:28:00.880 --> 1:28:09.760]  20th biden will be sworn in at january 6 the big push was from the q people was oh my gosh
[1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:19.200]  trump is going to be put in that day biden will be arrested and i said stay away from dc
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:25.120]  don't be part of any violence watch your back this is not the time to demonstrate
[1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:29.120]  right this is the insanity
[1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:37.760]  and so that's why i have a visceral response i'm triggered like a leftist when i hear this or i
[1:28:37.760 --> 1:28:43.600]  see this because anything historically that's hidden in esoteric and wearing a mask you're

[1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:34.000]  report it's alex jones so i'm actually glad that adam called in and asked who and what is q and the
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:39.360]  answer is the same thing is anonymous people done good thing as hackers white hat activity
[1:33:40.080 --> 1:33:44.240]  calling themselves anonymous and wearing the guy fox mask a lot of bad stuff's been done
[1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:53.360]  in its name and so anything that is hidden and esoteric is a lot of fun for some people but it's
[1:33:53.360 --> 1:34:01.440]  very very dangerous and not good and that's basically where we are on that issue and i'm
[1:34:01.440 --> 1:34:07.440]  pretty much done talking about it um it's been crawling out from under its rock again and
[1:34:07.440 --> 1:34:13.440]  and people need to understand that it is simply going to try to lead the liberty movement astray
[1:34:14.560 --> 1:34:18.800]  you had trump up there saying what he believed in and he was the president you have tucker
[1:34:18.800 --> 1:34:23.520]  carlson you have alex jones you have yourself you have countless others who have long histories
[1:34:23.520 --> 1:34:29.040]  you know who they are you know what they have to say and what they're doing and then you've got
[1:34:29.040 --> 1:34:33.120]  groups that tell you everything's wonderful and everything's about to be fixed and everything's
[1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:38.960]  fine now i'll tell you worldwide the pendulum has been swinging back against globalism and
[1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:43.600]  tyranny for a while that's why you're seeing the lockdowns and the surveillance and the wars and
[1:34:43.600 --> 1:34:48.960]  all the inflation is they're trying to distract us and get us back in our cages so there is a lot
[1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:53.280]  of good things happening that's because you've been spreading the word and you've been waking up
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:59.440]  and you've been waking other people up not some magical intelligence agency or group
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:05.440]  and for me it's not about name dropping and most these meetings have been off record
[1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:12.720]  but i haven't just met with people like general flin many times i met with other former intelligence
[1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:21.280]  agency heads i've met with well-known very famous billionaires i and and at these meetings they're
[1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:27.040]  not trying to flatter me they're spending most their time asking what i believe and it isn't
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:31.600]  about oh alex jones knows it all when they have meetings with smart people they want to hear from
[1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:38.880]  them and i want to hear from them and our knowledge base is about on par with each other it's about
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:47.600]  equal and so we've got the best thinking with the facts on what's going on and it's completely
[1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:53.120]  transparent i have a stack of new studies one out of israel one out of the uk with the same number
[1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:59.440]  of spike in emergency room heart problems among fully vaccinated young adults 25 increase
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:07.600]  i mean that's real numbers real studies real things you can sync your teeth into and check
[1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:14.880]  but the corporate media almost never gives you any documentation they just say alex jones is a
[1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:21.840]  light supremacist or they just say alex jones ran january 6 or they just say this stuff with no proof
[1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:28.000]  and you shouldn't walk you should run from people like that i want to get to all your calls i apologize
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:34.240]  i spent 20 minutes on this but it's an important topic a painful topic got a lot of people hurt
[1:36:34.240 --> 1:36:39.680]  on january 6 honest that folks are in jail because they thought that they were part of a secret plan
[1:36:39.680 --> 1:36:44.640]  working with trump and it wasn't trump it was the deep state manipulating trump supporters
[1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:50.640]  so they could demonize all of us together and their plan basically fizzled as a dud but still
[1:36:50.640 --> 1:36:55.040]  caused damage and we're sad for all those including the police officer the dad of heart attack later
[1:36:55.040 --> 1:37:01.520]  and others particularly ashley babbitt and others that died okay adam in oklahoma did that answer
[1:37:01.520 --> 1:37:06.720]  your question yes sir that was a very powerful answer and god bless you alex uh what you wrapped
[1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:11.200]  up there is the reason why i called and asked it's just so many people took the bait for this and it
[1:37:11.200 --> 1:37:16.880]  troubles me and there's so many real things happening uh that was the intent of my call and i sure
[1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:22.880]  appreciate the answer oh listen i had nothing to do with you it was a great question i'll just be
[1:37:22.880 --> 1:37:29.120]  honest with you i am very angry about january 6 and i'm very angry how they stole the election
[1:37:29.120 --> 1:37:35.920]  and i'm very angry how people bought into q i'm not angry with them i just it just enrages me so
[1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:40.240]  i'm sorry that some of that rage sounded like it was directed at you and i know it's been a long
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:44.320]  conversation uh but i would if you'd let me say a prayer for you i'd sure appreciate that
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:50.400]  um father god thank you for uh some of the things that are coming to light in this world
[1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:56.240]  and i thank you for the courage that alex and his team have had uh and father as with as these
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:38:01.280]  things come to the surface uh let us all look in the mirror and at our own sins and let us
[1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:08.080]  see what christ has done for us and let us work on our own walk uh um there we all have room for
[1:38:08.080 --> 1:38:13.120]  improvement father but as some of these treacherous evils come to light just let us look in the mirror
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:18.320]  as well and we just thank you and give you praise in jesus name amen amen thank you so much adam
[1:38:18.320 --> 1:38:34.960]  thank you so much i'm so exhausted i mean the bible says with great knowledge comes great sorrow
[1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:41.920]  and it's it's really true we could end this and fix this so quickly but as christ said the people
[1:38:41.920 --> 1:38:48.560]  perish for lack of knowledge and we are just already going into the new world order and it's
[1:38:48.560 --> 1:38:53.040]  just gonna it's gonna be so rough and you know i don't want to sit up here and and tell you things
[1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:58.160]  are gonna get tough and demoralize you at least you know ahead of other people and you can warn
[1:38:58.160 --> 1:39:08.240]  them and get ready but i wish i could sit up here and give you all roses and tell you everything's
[1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:16.160]  going to be fine it's not and Winston Churchill after the battle of duncurt when the british
[1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:21.040]  forces have been smashed and pushed into the ocean by the nazis he can pull a speech up and he says i
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:29.120]  cannot offer you peace i can't offer you safety i can't offer you anything but blood sweat and tears
[1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:35.280]  and a long hard war but i know this at the end we will win the outcome of fighting and defeating
[1:39:35.280 --> 1:39:39.440]  this tyranny will be much greater than living under it and submitting to it and so we're going to go
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:48.080]  on to the end whatever the cost may be that's all i can offer you i i mean i could get up here and
[1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:55.120]  have three times the listeners if i blew a bunch of smoke up your rear end folks i just can't do it
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:40:06.160]  i just can't do it and that doesn't mean that i'm not literally shaken by this information
[1:40:06.160 --> 1:40:11.280]  you know every day i get up and there's a new bill gates or claus schwaver or harari quote
[1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:16.080]  where they're gonna depopulate us and they're gonna take everything we've got i got a new
[1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:20.560]  quote from him today about yeah you'll have no freedom you'll have no privacy you'll have no
[1:40:20.560 --> 1:40:28.000]  democracy you'll have no privacy i mean you just they're just in our faces and and i i think we're
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:34.160]  better than these people at least as good as them why do we let trash like this sit up there and
[1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:40.640]  declare war on us and instead everybody still wants to talk about jfk jr is still alive and he's
[1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:45.200]  going to show up with trump and they're going to run for president that's just the most insane
[1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:55.120]  horse crap ever heard but they do it to punch your buttons and see what they can get you to do
[1:40:58.080 --> 1:41:01.360]  and let me say this about my beloved populist christian right wing
[1:41:02.560 --> 1:41:05.600]  who's the smartest most informed hard worker people on the face of the planet
[1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:14.080]  and who i'm humbled to know the delusional behavior in the patriot movement is one one
[1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:17.840]  hundred thousand democrats the democrats think a man can become a woman
[1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:23.680]  and a woman can become a man they think chopping a little boys genitals off a little girl's breast
[1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:29.760]  off uh is a a plus they think pedophilia is good they think inflation is good they think open
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:34.320]  borders and disease is good they think fentanyl is good they think the evaluation of currencies is
[1:41:34.320 --> 1:41:40.720]  good they think famine and death and destruction and everything is good and you look at them they're
[1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:49.360]  jokes and they're very sad and so when we see delusion we have to understand that that is our
[1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:59.200]  enemy so if something is too good to be true it is too good to be true and there ain't no free

[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:05.360]  big breaking news i'll hit at the end of the segment dealing with george soros and his mind
[1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:10.640]  control board his ministry of truth can't make that up it's all real all happening doesn't get a
[1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:16.080]  lot worse than we wake up and say no but let's talk to a great caller in colorado let's talk to julio
[1:48:19.040 --> 1:48:26.400]  andro it's good to chat with you senior it's been a while i escaped illinois the chicago area a city
[1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:34.320]  that it was once a crown jewel of the midwest and the us escaped to uh northern colorado where
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:39.440]  there are a lot of patriots i see a lot of info wars bumper stickers a lot of beautiful people out
[1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:45.360]  there but i tell you what alex i've never seen a homeless problem like i've seen in denver colorado
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:52.000]  i call it mouth skid like skid row in la it's incredible folks if you're in a city if you're
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:58.480]  near a metropolitan area i'd say escape while you can because it's going to be horrific in the years
[1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:03.680]  to come and for those that don't know i didn't know you were the julio i knew you've been a guest
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:09.680]  on the show a few times you're a reporter so get to have you here with us julio yeah good to be back
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:16.560]  alex it's been a while uh since i've last spoken to you uh it's incredible to see where we are in
[1:49:16.560 --> 1:49:23.040]  this country from i mean god i started listening to you when i was in college uh oh 10 11 years ago
[1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:28.720]  it's insane you know when i first started calling i spoke a lot about weather modification the air
[1:49:28.720 --> 1:49:35.040]  force has a document owning a weather as a force multiplier owning the weather in 2025 well then
[1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:40.880]  it's a part of a six-piece document series called air force 2025 where they go through a bunch of
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:48.560]  scenarios that they forecast for the year 2025 and here we are a few years out and it's quite insane
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:54.480]  to see especially in this document talking about transnational corporations and their power and
[1:49:54.480 --> 1:50:01.360]  influence over you know over policy over wars and we're seeing that right now especially with a guy
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:07.360]  like bill gates my biggest concern alex you know you see with the situation in ukraine and russia
[1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:12.800]  with fertilizer and wheat prices skyrocketing you're also going to see that with hay i spoke to a hay
[1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:20.080]  farmer out in northeastern colorado who's hitting the panic button about wheat uh hay futures oh
[1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:26.320]  there's an incredible cascading chain reaction no no doubt about it i mean if you look at the u.s
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:32.560]  drought monitor the biggest areas in the country that's dealing with drought is the western part
[1:50:32.560 --> 1:50:37.600]  of the united states that's california where produces a lot of fruits and vegetables wine
[1:50:38.320 --> 1:50:45.600]  colorado you have the high plains as well nebraska oklahoma wyoming with a lot of wheat that
[1:50:45.600 --> 1:50:51.760]  is dependent across the country so i i've attended several weather modification conferences over the
[1:50:51.760 --> 1:50:58.480]  last few years wanting uh san antonio texas beautiful city one in fargo dr coder so there's no doubt
[1:50:58.480 --> 1:51:04.000]  in my mind that weather modification programs are taking place and if you if people just search
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:09.440]  geoengineering they'll read people like alan roeback from ruptures oh absolutely and it all ties
[1:51:09.440 --> 1:51:15.040]  together and it's all part of the depopulation plan they they really admit they're doing it
[1:51:15.040 --> 1:51:19.360]  julio thank you for holding it's great hearing from you if you ever want to shoot us an email or
[1:51:19.360 --> 1:51:23.040]  come on as a guest or tell us what you're doing these days maybe you can do some reporting for us
[1:51:23.040 --> 1:51:29.600]  while you're out in uh out in colorado and and let me take this get his number guys thanks thanks
[1:51:29.600 --> 1:51:36.240]  julio take this full circle the left is farming homeless they advertise it they bring them there
[1:51:36.240 --> 1:51:41.200]  they give them food they give and then they get welfare checks that the leftist group skin the
[1:51:41.200 --> 1:51:47.920]  skin the top off of and so they're farming the homeless like a farmer would farm wheat or
[1:51:47.920 --> 1:51:56.560]  corn or soybeans all right up next here would be ebbin in california ebbin thank you for calling
[1:51:57.920 --> 1:52:03.200]  alex it's a pleasure to talk to you today hey alex i wanted to uh point out that i think the
[1:52:03.200 --> 1:52:08.640]  key to victory is the church and jesus christ and all the people in america that are christians
[1:52:08.640 --> 1:52:13.360]  and if i could point something out i noticed that in churches and studies they say that they stop
[1:52:13.360 --> 1:52:19.600]  preaching prophecy 25 of the bible's prophecy and it essentially is talking about what you're talking
[1:52:19.600 --> 1:52:25.440]  about so the great disconnect and where the power has been removed almost like a q movement thing
[1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:32.560]  where the power has been removed from america is with weak pastors that got bribed into not
[1:52:32.560 --> 1:52:37.920]  preaching prophecy and then we have pastors that will preach the rapture which i actually believe
[1:52:37.920 --> 1:52:43.680]  and at some point but that christians think hey if i just you know go to sleep and rest
[1:52:43.680 --> 1:52:48.160]  that everything will be done right why believe the reason why god's allowed so many people to
[1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:54.080]  suffer with the vaccine and things like that is so that they'll realize god is trying to do us a
[1:52:54.080 --> 1:52:59.920]  favor telling us about prophecy he's trying to get us ready and the listeners are the greatest
[1:52:59.920 --> 1:53:04.640]  fault of the earth are the info wars listeners and i just want to point out because i've been
[1:53:04.640 --> 1:53:09.360]  able to do it effectively in california just one guy building a couple little websites and stuff
[1:53:09.360 --> 1:53:15.600]  like that if every listener confronted the pastors in their town and said you got to deal
[1:53:15.600 --> 1:53:20.320]  with this let me know what you think about info wars tell me about this message if it actually
[1:53:20.320 --> 1:53:28.320]  would cost a pastor his you know success in a town if he forced pastors to deal with info wars
[1:53:28.320 --> 1:53:35.600]  dot com and the prophetic message that essentially you're preaching and i do believe that info wars
[1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:40.160]  is the most effective church on planet earth forgetting the word of god out it's the one
[1:53:40.160 --> 1:53:45.680]  that isn't holding back you don't have ulterior motives from the product you sell i really enjoyed
[1:53:45.680 --> 1:53:51.760]  x2 from the product you sell and everything you're saying you're risking your life and frankly
[1:53:51.760 --> 1:53:58.400]  most christian pastors aren't they should be banned they should be banned not you it's the pastors
[1:53:58.400 --> 1:54:03.840]  that are supposed to be talking about the new world order not you so what you know essentially i
[1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:08.400]  believe you and oh and the whole info wars team on the most effective church and planet earth
[1:54:08.400 --> 1:54:13.200]  and i really would like to urge people that were given to their weak neighborly church
[1:54:13.760 --> 1:54:18.720]  to confront that church and to start making their ties and offerings to info wars and just
[1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:24.160]  saying i'm an evangelist i have a jesus christ worldwide ministries dot org website his abortion
[1:54:24.160 --> 1:54:28.640]  murder might i'm doing what i can but i'll tell you this the most effective ministry tool i've
[1:54:28.640 --> 1:54:34.480]  ever had for people to come in christ was explaining to him about info wars and i learned about the
[1:54:34.480 --> 1:54:40.400]  real world now they have the fear of god in them which should have been there the entire time so
[1:54:40.400 --> 1:54:44.720]  i beautifully said the churches have been taken over they're not doing their jobs on average
[1:54:44.720 --> 1:54:48.880]  and the churches should be exploding in size right now his prophecies fulfilled the church
[1:54:48.880 --> 1:54:52.560]  should be on the front lines fighting all this evil but instead it's become really the heart
[1:54:52.560 --> 1:54:56.240]  of the new world order and that's why it goes back to the people on the ground like you and i
[1:54:56.240 --> 1:55:02.160]  and god bless you sir and i appreciate your call powerful call say another powerful call here

[1:55:41.040 --> 1:55:45.840]  terror storm was a new your latest documentary when i started listening it's been that long so
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:51.440]  your studio is like a little broom closet it was tiny so it's amazing to see what's happened in the
[1:55:51.440 --> 1:55:57.040]  last 15 years but i mean that's not why i'm calling it i'm calling in i kind of goes on from the
[1:55:57.040 --> 1:56:03.760]  last caller really just about um you know christianity and and following jesus i i used to kind of
[1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:09.840]  almost scoff when i hear you talk about god on the show back way back when i grew up in the church
[1:56:09.840 --> 1:56:17.760]  of england um and i live in the u.s now but i grew up in england and it was very easy to become cold
[1:56:17.760 --> 1:56:25.200]  because it just there was no talk of a real relationship between god and jesus it just it
[1:56:25.200 --> 1:56:31.120]  wasn't really it was you kind of read a few bible passages and it was very dry and very dark um and
[1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:40.880]  so i strayed for many years um but it wasn't until i was locked down in spain in 2020 that i heard
[1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:46.400]  pastor rodney on your show who's on your show last week you know it was and it was a fantastic

[2:00:06.880 --> 2:00:15.200]  there is a spiritual war going on
[2:00:18.240 --> 2:00:20.960]  and the only thing that makes sense when you look at what the new world order is doing
[2:00:21.760 --> 2:00:28.080]  is that they're carrying out satan's operation which was predicted more than 2000 years ago
[2:00:28.640 --> 2:00:34.240]  and regardless whether jesus and god is real the blueprint is proven historically to stop this evil
[2:00:34.240 --> 2:00:38.720]  and the globalists are targeting it may know it's the answer because of course it's real
[2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:42.240]  but they're going to be countless opportunists and devils
[2:00:44.160 --> 2:00:49.840]  that are going to try to put themselves in between you and god there's a lot of great
[2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:55.120]  pastors i'm not saying they're bad there are some that try to mislead that's what jesus said you
[2:00:55.120 --> 2:01:00.080]  need a personal relationship with god that christ the new testament was all about but getting back
[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:05.920]  to justin start over a little bit you were saying it wasn't till you were in lockdown in spain
[2:01:05.920 --> 2:01:10.400]  listening to pastor rodney howard brown on the show that something happened please continue
[2:01:11.920 --> 2:01:17.120]  well alex yeah it was it was your show i was listening to to the podcast i mean like i said
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:24.320]  earlier i've been listening nearly daily for 15 years and something something in what he was saying
[2:01:24.320 --> 2:01:30.400]  it just reached into my soul and touched something and i just felt i said to myself i remember saying
[2:01:30.400 --> 2:01:36.640]  to myself if this guy's church was in tamper as soon as i get home to tamper i would be there every
[2:01:36.640 --> 2:01:40.320]  day and i didn't even know his church was in tamper until the end of the broadcast where he
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:49.680]  he announced where the river church was um and as soon as i got back to florida in december 2020
[2:01:49.680 --> 2:01:56.320]  after the holidays holidays were done it was the first it was the first sunday of 2021 and i it was
[2:01:56.320 --> 2:02:00.400]  the sunday morning and i sat up right in bed like a wider week like i've got to go to the river
[2:02:02.320 --> 2:02:07.520]  something truly profound and i i went to the church that day i never i had never
[2:02:08.240 --> 2:02:12.240]  watched a service or anything like that online i kind of even forgot about it until i was at that
[2:02:12.240 --> 2:02:19.520]  moment it was kind of weird um and i got touched i hadn't even got it out of my car and it was
[2:02:19.520 --> 2:02:24.480]  like a medicine ball hit me in my chest and i was like pushed back into the car seat and i was like
[2:02:24.480 --> 2:02:30.560]  wow this is this is the power of god stuff that people have been i've been hearing about oh yeah
[2:02:30.560 --> 2:02:38.160]  this is big spirit powerful absolutely and i tell you what and i i i guess the reason for me telling
[2:02:38.160 --> 2:02:46.640]  this story is to just say to people that once you submit to god and the holy spirit and and give
[2:02:46.640 --> 2:02:53.680]  your life to jesus things will just start happening in your life and are you always used to you know
[2:02:53.680 --> 2:02:57.760]  god's talking to me my whole life i didn't even realize it you know you think of it i used to
[2:02:57.760 --> 2:03:03.520]  think of it as my my gut you know that gut feeling and every time i ignored my gut you know it was
[2:03:03.520 --> 2:03:10.800]  the wrong thing to do um and ever since i i started going to to pastor rodney's church the river at
[2:03:10.800 --> 2:03:17.520]  tamper bay the listening and obeying that's the most important thing you have to be obedient
[2:03:17.520 --> 2:03:24.960]  to that voice and as soon as you just obediently follow that voice um and trust that it's good
[2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:30.400]  and it's it's got you know your best interest at heart and the best interest of the world at heart
[2:03:31.120 --> 2:03:36.240]  things just start unlocking doors start opening just profound you have profound experiences
[2:03:36.240 --> 2:03:43.600]  just like i've had and it's been the most incredible yet but the beautiful symbiotic thing about this
[2:03:43.600 --> 2:03:50.400]  is that the increases i've seen in my own life you know i make i make more money now than i've
[2:03:50.400 --> 2:03:55.440]  ever made in my life before and it's been truly incredible but the brilliant thing about that is
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:04:01.440]  you know i don't live some ostentatious lifestyle all that increase enables me to give more money
[2:04:01.440 --> 2:04:06.400]  into the info it allows me to tie more money into my church enables me to help other people in the
[2:04:06.400 --> 2:04:12.480]  community and i'm i get so much joy from being able to do that and it all comes down and that's
[2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:16.800]  what's beautiful and then the more you do it the more you're given that is exactly how it works and
[2:04:16.800 --> 2:04:21.760]  that's why christian nations even though they aren't purely christian but they try they are the ones
[2:04:21.760 --> 2:04:25.440]  that have all the prosperity and all the power and everyone wants to come there is because where
[2:04:25.440 --> 2:04:30.720]  there is christ there is prosperity where there is the devil there is collapse and evil and pain
[2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:40.320]  very powerful justin thank you for calling powerful call god bless you all right monica and then carlos

[2:07:42.240 --> 2:07:47.920]  basically that protesting was a non essential activity yeah that's something they did to
[2:07:47.920 --> 2:07:52.560]  conservatives uh not just here but around the world if you were black lives matter or a communist
[2:07:52.560 --> 2:07:57.200]  group you could protest in france or england or the us but if you were a christian or a
[2:07:57.200 --> 2:08:02.160]  conservative protesting well then in some jurisdictions the police would even tackle people
[2:08:02.720 --> 2:08:09.440]  and brutalize them and take them to jail so uh that's what happened to you huh um i went i went
[2:08:09.440 --> 2:08:17.680]  peace police and i i actually informed some of the news that it showed um one of my statements as i
[2:08:17.680 --> 2:08:23.840]  was taken away was that the police were just doing their job and i was just doing mine
[2:08:23.840 --> 2:08:30.960]  and i honestly felt at the time that once it got when you're arrested um it's no longer your fight
[2:08:30.960 --> 2:08:36.720]  with the police it's now a fight with the court well let me expand on this i found a wxi i report
[2:08:36.720 --> 2:08:42.880]  saying people arrested uh for protesting the lockdown uh wow that's is is that the demonstration
[2:08:42.880 --> 2:08:49.360]  you were talking about um later on there were more the mine was the first nationwide and i
[2:08:49.360 --> 2:08:54.960]  was the only one that stayed in an apartment so you were the tip of the spear well thank god you
[2:08:54.960 --> 2:09:01.840]  helped reopen the country we salute you thank you so um my attorney did receive a letter back from
[2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:08.400]  governor cooper stating of course what we already knew which is my constitution overrides your
[2:09:08.400 --> 2:09:16.880]  governor's order but i was found guilty in court about a year ago for um defying the governor's
[2:09:16.880 --> 2:09:25.200]  order and for trespassing on public properties where i pay taxes um and it's in appeal court right
[2:09:25.200 --> 2:09:32.160]  now so i'm calling in because i want to remind people of a few things one is they're intimidating us
[2:09:32.160 --> 2:09:38.800]  and they're feeding us by uh fire hose right now and simultaneously they're isolating us from each
[2:09:38.800 --> 2:09:44.720]  other by censoring news stories so we don't know about each other so that's right that's why it's
[2:09:44.720 --> 2:09:49.440]  important you call into the show now we know about what happened to you god bless you and thank you
[2:09:49.440 --> 2:09:54.960]  wow what a wonderful lady all right let's go ahead and go to carlos in canada carlos welcome sir
[2:09:54.960 --> 2:10:02.880]  thank you alex um basically what i wanted to mention to you is that the effort to have a
[2:10:02.880 --> 2:10:10.560]  world government has taken place before it's not the first time that the same players that are behind
[2:10:10.560 --> 2:10:18.880]  the moves now were uh in the 1920s actually in january 1920 they propose uh the league of nation
[2:10:18.880 --> 2:10:25.440]  sure the very same people's a rock of fellers the Rothschilds absolutely and whenever i sort of like
[2:10:25.440 --> 2:10:31.920]  wonder oh gee you know i'm losing my focus on history i read one quote and he brings me right back
[2:10:32.560 --> 2:10:40.240]  and it's a quote from amsh mayer amshel Rothschild uh 1773 as you know was an important day for me
[2:10:40.240 --> 2:10:46.960]  but it says here let me issue and control a nation's money and i care not who writes the law
[2:10:46.960 --> 2:10:54.240]  now when i read that it puts me right back where it belongs because you see the supply lines to the
[2:10:54.240 --> 2:11:02.640]  globalist is money and canadians and americans pay taxes and we're paying through our taxes for
[2:11:02.640 --> 2:11:08.480]  these people to go ahead and bring about world government now when the league of nations was
[2:11:08.480 --> 2:11:13.680]  proposed to the american people when they had a government that they could rely on was not going
[2:11:13.680 --> 2:11:20.320]  to be a government to kill them or destroy them or to steal their future this government rejected
[2:11:20.320 --> 2:11:27.520]  the league of nations i can't believe that there are 50 governors in the states that will approve
[2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:33.920]  having the sovereignty of the united states in the health of the individual surrendered to some
[2:11:33.920 --> 2:11:40.160]  global organization that's going to be run by people like bill gates i can't i just can't that's
[2:11:40.160 --> 2:11:45.280]  right i mean it's barely on fox news it's almost no coverage other than independent shows like this
[2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:49.200]  one which is super frustrating folks i wish it was everywhere it's like hey we're the only ones
[2:11:49.200 --> 2:11:55.360]  covering it the u n openly is announced with bill gates that the world economic forum will
[2:11:55.360 --> 2:12:00.240]  will be in control of everybody's health care with the u n and they're going to be meeting the
[2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:07.280]  23rd of the 28th just absolutely outrageous we've got to raise the alarm bell that's right
[2:12:07.280 --> 2:12:16.080]  alec may i make a comment yes a last comment on on ukraine first of all um the world economic
[2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:23.840]  forum has been putting out this fellow um you vow hariri at some sort of spokesperson
[2:12:23.840 --> 2:12:30.320]  well i have to tell you something he's a history uh professor of medieval history he
[2:12:30.320 --> 2:12:37.360]  has absolutely no real authority i guess sure they just celebrate him because he says psychotic
[2:12:37.360 --> 2:12:41.360]  stuff like we're going to kill everybody you're all slaves i mean that's he's just their spokesperson
[2:12:41.360 --> 2:12:46.000]  because he says what they believe what i would like bomb a neuropsychologist by training and i
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:51.760]  can tell you about uh i said i never wanted to explain to you the sources of my training but
[2:12:51.760 --> 2:12:56.160]  if you ever have the time i will but i want to tell you something all these people are talking
[2:12:56.160 --> 2:13:01.680]  about the brain they know nothing first of all if you put nanoparticles into the brain and you
[2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:06.880]  think you're going to control it i can use for you the brain has an immune system built in
[2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:10.880]  and he will reject it and you're all you're going to give somebody is Alzheimer's all you're going
[2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:15.200]  to do is cause brain plex oh and you're going to create more than that you're going to create a lot
[2:13:15.200 --> 2:13:21.360]  of mental illness you think your brain has decision-making abilities that are going to be countered
[2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:27.040]  by some external unknown force you got me you're crazy well you know they're selling the nanoparticles
[2:13:27.040 --> 2:13:30.080]  they're now putting in the food in the u.s. after he just said we have no jurisdiction
[2:13:30.720 --> 2:13:33.920]  as something that's going to augment us but you're absolutely right all it's going to cause
[2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:38.320]  his mental illness and death thank you so much carlos incredible call i'd love to have him back
[2:13:38.320 --> 2:13:44.320]  on as a guest he's so smart really really well-known uh scientist up in canada from spain
[2:13:44.320 --> 2:13:48.640]  all right let's take another call let's i promise jam a lot in here who's up next here
[2:13:48.640 --> 2:13:53.840]  isn't holding on this that would be uh rodney in missouri rodney welcome go ahead
[2:13:56.480 --> 2:14:00.720]  hey rodney how you doing buddy good how you doing alec good brother go ahead you got two minutes
[2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:07.600]  okay awesome uh i just had an ideal um one thing that i would think a lot of info words we have
[2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:13.280]  would be uh gold and uh this may be a stupid up deal let me let me press that but uh
[2:14:13.280 --> 2:14:20.720]  uh what if what if anyone that sent in one ounce of gold you gave them back a one-tenth ounce
[2:14:20.720 --> 2:14:26.720]  gold coin but like a certificate of authenticity flash uh hey that'd be great because i don't
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:30.560]  have any gold i don't have any gold i used to have gold in my ex-wife got at the divorce
[2:14:31.120 --> 2:14:36.640]  and uh but i'm i'm literally out of money myself so yeah no so that's what i was thinking it would
[2:14:36.640 --> 2:14:42.480]  really help out the the info war and uh you know anyone that sent in one ounce get back to one
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:48.640]  tenth ounce and it'd really just be to help the info wars and uh that's a beautiful idea we ought
[2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:54.560]  we ought to print a tenth of an ounce original coin uh minute and then tell folks send us your coin
[2:14:55.360 --> 2:14:58.720]  bullion whatever and then we'll be able to sell it from the operation and they get a little piece
[2:14:58.720 --> 2:15:02.480]  of history that's a our listeners would come through with that i know they would that is
[2:15:02.480 --> 2:15:07.440]  we're gonna do that brother your idea is gonna happen yeah because i think that would be amazing
[2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:11.680]  and then like you you sign all of them that would be the main that would be like the one
[2:15:11.680 --> 2:15:15.280]  that only the people that send in the one ounce would get and then you can make nine others
[2:15:15.840 --> 2:15:20.240]  one trillion percent somebody sends us an ounce of gold they're gonna get a handwritten note
[2:15:20.240 --> 2:15:24.400]  because that's what we need is things that have a big profit in them to fight i haven't announced
[2:15:24.400 --> 2:15:29.360]  this yet but we now officially know and it's gonna come out soon it is george soros behind

[2:21:00.080 --> 2:21:05.440]  the same guy that called in about ray yet and uh one point i mean that was absolutely true what i
[2:21:05.440 --> 2:21:10.880]  said and i don't think he was lying but obviously i think he already had the seizure they had the
[2:21:10.880 --> 2:21:15.440]  seizure planned so that they could get out and one thing i wanted to say why aren't some of our
[2:21:15.440 --> 2:21:22.000]  politicians getting this guy under oath yeah why does the fbi want to talk to me when i'm on record
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:26.240]  trying to stop what happened and they know damn well uh that i was just there giving the speech on
[2:21:26.240 --> 2:21:29.920]  the fifth and along for the ride and you know trying to organize peaceful demonstrations
[2:21:29.920 --> 2:21:34.320]  anything i've done many times i have no history of that it'd be idiotic to take over the capital
[2:21:34.960 --> 2:21:39.200]  it blew up and everybody's face when some people did it and you've got all these provocateurs
[2:21:39.200 --> 2:21:44.480]  and none of them have been arrested like ray apps it's ridiculous oh no you saved me you saved me
[2:21:44.480 --> 2:21:49.360]  honestly you know like i i may have went in if it wasn't if it wasn't for you there it's saying not
[2:21:49.360 --> 2:21:55.120]  to i mean it it's it is ridiculous well god bless you sir and i appreciate your call let's go to
[2:21:57.200 --> 2:22:04.640]  kami fornia dreaming you're on the air go ahead alex god bless you i love you um i'm calling
[2:22:04.640 --> 2:22:09.280]  because uh first of all i've been listening every day for five years i never miss a moment of your
[2:22:09.280 --> 2:22:14.240]  show i use a whole litany of your products every single day i've spent thousands of dollars
[2:22:14.240 --> 2:22:19.920]  trying to support the info war and uh the reason i'm calling today i'll get right to the point is
[2:22:19.920 --> 2:22:26.480]  that um the bible a lot of people look at uh the book of revelation to kind of try to describe
[2:22:26.480 --> 2:22:32.160]  what's going on these days but i think um the book of judges and the book of kings are very
[2:22:32.160 --> 2:22:37.520]  informative as well because if you look the israelites became decadent and disobedient
[2:22:38.160 --> 2:22:45.040]  and god allowed enemies to rise up and afflict them and they would get taken over essentially
[2:22:45.040 --> 2:22:50.320]  and then god those books are about god warning the israelites the becoming decadent again like
[2:22:50.320 --> 2:22:57.440]  we are going back into bondage having a revival and being delivered again amen and i think what's
[2:22:57.440 --> 2:23:03.360]  going on now i i spend a lot of time on gab communicating with uh people who are patriots
[2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:08.480]  and i love them but i think a lot of people are still in kind of a cult of trump and putting a
[2:23:08.480 --> 2:23:13.840]  lot of trust in trump and not trust in god now let's look at what trump we've been seeing from
[2:23:13.840 --> 2:23:20.080]  him lately um you know he uh first of all he didn't pardon assange with which i think is an
[2:23:20.080 --> 2:23:26.000]  inexcusable faux pas um he had dr awes on the stage the other night endorsing him and and
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:33.360]  dr awes has come out and openly endorsed the death shot um trump also uh touted um his
[2:23:33.920 --> 2:23:40.480]  partnership with the j and j ceo the other day and bragged about knowing him and uh you know he
[2:23:40.480 --> 2:23:48.080]  led operation warp speed uh he's been touting the death shots and um you know i think at this
[2:23:48.080 --> 2:23:52.720]  point we need to realize that we can't put our trust in the man that is trump i know that he
[2:23:52.720 --> 2:23:59.840]  you know for first of all he's either completely tone deaf or he's a capitulated deep stator but
[2:23:59.840 --> 2:24:05.440]  i think the point is is we need to like a lot of the callers have been saying is get right with god
[2:24:05.440 --> 2:24:12.720]  focus on god and when we turn back to the temple symbolically that's when he will deliver us and
[2:24:12.720 --> 2:24:17.920]  that was what i wanted to call about i totally agree no king became jesus trust in god not in man i
[2:24:17.920 --> 2:24:23.120]  don't think trumps a bad person uh but once he gets committed to something he's very pigheaded and i
[2:24:23.120 --> 2:24:28.560]  agree he's very tone deaf with dr awes he's making a lot of people mad my big issue is the global
[2:24:28.560 --> 2:24:34.320]  is trying to start war war three trying to shut down free speech in america and i'm just wanting
[2:24:34.320 --> 2:24:38.480]  to get a lot of good republicans elected in the midterms and trumps help and do that he's not
[2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:44.320]  perfect but i absolutely agree with it and i've got some major problems thank you sir all right
[2:24:44.320 --> 2:24:50.160]  i'll take another caller here in the order they are received let's talk to marcos in ohio marcos

[2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:08.960]  do and all the supporters for keeping you going and i just had a couple suggestions for the show
[2:25:08.960 --> 2:25:14.640]  if you don't mind please i just wondered maybe there's a way you could do like a raffle say for
[2:25:14.640 --> 2:25:19.680]  a twenty dollar shirt and then charge five dollars for an entry i bet every bit of ten people would
[2:25:19.680 --> 2:25:23.920]  do it so you there's a lot of ways for us to raise money and we're doing it we're just toe to toe
[2:25:23.920 --> 2:25:28.080]  with soros trying to shut us down but we're gonna stay on air thanks to all you folks out there
[2:25:28.800 --> 2:25:33.840]  yes sir uh one two more things i was gonna say maybe put like a little megaphone icon on your
[2:25:33.840 --> 2:25:39.040]  website with like three cores like a 10 second clip to get out to all the other info warriors
[2:25:39.040 --> 2:25:44.320]  maybe you could charge for to do it for free and i'd ask maybe you could play the national anthem

[2:33:15.520 --> 2:33:24.640]  i hear people talking bad about the way well george soros and the democratic party
[2:33:25.440 --> 2:33:29.200]  tried as hard as they could to stop her from being able to run for congress again because they
[2:33:29.200 --> 2:33:33.520]  want to stop the will of the voters they wanted to do that because she wanted to question the
[2:33:33.520 --> 2:33:40.160]  election results something they do almost every major election challenge over marjorie taylor green's
[2:33:40.160 --> 2:33:47.040]  eligibility fails shame on them and it's failed on a bunch of other members of congress as well
[2:33:47.040 --> 2:33:53.360]  meanwhile we have george soros operative appointed as biden's ministry of truth co-chair and we have
[2:33:53.360 --> 2:34:00.720]  20 states threatened legal action over dhs ministry of truth board mtg on the road graciously
[2:34:00.720 --> 2:34:06.160]  popping in for just a little while thank you so much and i want to say congratulations uh you
[2:34:06.160 --> 2:34:10.160]  know for fighting back and winning but at the same time you shouldn't have even had to be in court you
[2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:14.560]  don't have a criminal record you weren't under indictment you're not a felon they had no reason
[2:34:14.560 --> 2:34:20.560]  to do this this really discredits them but congratulations still well thank you alex and
[2:34:20.560 --> 2:34:25.200]  it does discredit them and shame on them forever putting me through this and putting the people
[2:34:25.200 --> 2:34:29.200]  in my district through this you know people have been really upset around here they've been talking
[2:34:29.200 --> 2:34:34.800]  about lawsuits they've been talking about how can we get these attorneys disbarred because they're
[2:34:34.800 --> 2:34:40.400]  perversing our courtrooms politicizing our courtrooms and frankly that's really election
[2:34:40.400 --> 2:34:45.440]  meddling that's what they're doing they're trying to meddle in our george election uh because we
[2:34:45.440 --> 2:34:51.120]  we were willing to ask questions and and work hard and object on january 6 there's nothing wrong
[2:34:51.120 --> 2:34:57.120]  with objecting and none of us had anything to do with uh what happened you know the riot and all
[2:34:57.120 --> 2:35:02.560]  that on january 6 but you know these same people you don't see them crying out about uh abortion
[2:35:02.560 --> 2:35:08.080]  protesters showing up at supreme court justice houses um you don't you don't see any of that
[2:35:08.080 --> 2:35:12.720]  and that's completely illegal but you know this is the way it rolls in politics politics the
[2:35:12.720 --> 2:35:18.880]  democrats will do anything they can uh to to destroy our freedoms and that's what they're
[2:35:18.880 --> 2:35:25.120]  trying to do right now where do you go from here uh because you shouldn't even have to sit there
[2:35:25.120 --> 2:35:31.360]  and been to been on the stand and uh although how dare you say that dancy polosi has engaged in
[2:35:31.360 --> 2:35:35.920]  treasonous activity everything they've done cutting off our pipelines our energy leaving
[2:35:35.920 --> 2:35:41.920]  our borders totally uh undefended in the south i mean all these things are what i would call classical
[2:35:41.920 --> 2:35:49.520]  treason of course they are and i mean that's what their job is to do is to protect our borders
[2:35:49.520 --> 2:35:53.920]  they're supposed to they're supposed to protect the borders of the state that's the role of the
[2:35:53.920 --> 2:35:58.800]  federal government they're they've completely abandoned that i mean our our government is
[2:35:58.800 --> 2:36:03.200]  allowing our country to be overrun they're helping it to be overrun they're enabling it
[2:36:03.200 --> 2:36:08.240]  so biden has protected basically invited everyone to just come on into the united state
[2:36:08.240 --> 2:36:13.440]  and he's the best friends and the best business partner with the cartels they've ever had
[2:36:13.440 --> 2:36:17.520]  but yeah what's going on right now is totally out of control and here's here's something i've
[2:36:17.520 --> 2:36:21.760]  been asking questions about alex and maybe you can help me out because i've got no answers for
[2:36:21.760 --> 2:36:31.440]  anyone else here's the the fei geofencing around the capital to go after people that that rioted and
[2:36:31.440 --> 2:36:35.680]  walked around you know the maga grandmas and tourists that walked around inside the capital
[2:36:35.680 --> 2:36:43.440]  then we have um you know the cdc using geofencing to track people's movements during lockdowns
[2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:47.600]  tyrannical lockdowns that should have never happened in the first place but now we've got
[2:36:47.600 --> 2:36:54.880]  a movie that came out 2000 mules and i can't get anybody in my state to to buy geofencing data and
[2:36:54.880 --> 2:37:00.880]  aggregate it to track um you know absentee ballot traffickers which we we know happened
[2:37:00.880 --> 2:37:04.960]  so i've been making a bunch of phone calls because i'm really upset about this and i think it's time
[2:37:04.960 --> 2:37:10.080]  that this gets investigated well you're absolutely right they use all this geolocating as peaceful
[2:37:10.080 --> 2:37:15.600]  americans and to track everybody illegally under covid but known criminals in other situations with
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:22.880]  human trafficking oh suddenly they can't use it yeah that's right it's it's insane and it makes no
[2:37:22.880 --> 2:37:28.000]  sense whatsoever um but you know if they can use it then i think we should be able to use it too
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:34.480]  and and find out how people uh what they did with these absentee ballots and these are the these
[2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:40.080]  are the right things to right things to look into you know and they did i mean i watched that movie
[2:37:40.080 --> 2:37:45.280]  just this past week and i was shocked absolutely shocked and and also blown away at the hard work of
[2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:51.360]  the people at true the vote that were able to to solve the the mystery that no one else apparently
[2:37:51.360 --> 2:37:56.000]  has been able to solve but i'm really hoping that i see see people step up to the plate
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:59.680]  i'm tired of the arguments and politics i just want people to do the right thing
[2:37:59.680 --> 2:38:05.280]  enforce our laws and make sure that this never happens again i'm glad you raised this film as
[2:38:05.280 --> 2:38:10.480]  that was one of the topics i wanted to get to with you as i've seen it now very powerful geolocating
[2:38:10.480 --> 2:38:14.480]  shows all the proof the same people putting in hundreds and hundreds of ballots at multiple
[2:38:14.480 --> 2:38:18.880]  locations and the democrats spend and say oh they're voting for their family they're wearing
[2:38:18.880 --> 2:38:24.400]  plastic gloves they're wearing masks we know this is how they did it um congresswoman and and
[2:38:24.400 --> 2:38:28.320]  now we have a smoking gun and so what are they doing they're suppressing it and censoring it of
[2:38:28.320 --> 2:38:35.360]  course yes of course i mean it's just it's ridiculous so you know everyone is waiting
[2:38:35.360 --> 2:38:40.560]  they're like when is someone going to finally prosecute this and and now the true the vote
[2:38:40.560 --> 2:38:45.920]  people they they have done all the hard work so i'm really hoping to see people in georgia step
[2:38:45.920 --> 2:38:50.960]  up to the plate and and investigate it because if what's good for the goose is how to be good for
[2:38:50.960 --> 2:38:56.960]  the gander and if the department the fb i can use fencing data to go after people around the
[2:38:56.960 --> 2:39:04.080]  capital the cdc can use geofencing data tracking people during lockdown then surely to god people
[2:39:04.080 --> 2:39:10.400]  here in georgia and wisconsin arizona all these other states can use the same methods and stop
[2:39:10.400 --> 2:39:16.000]  this criminal activity before they do it again because i'll tell you what alex um stacey abrams
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:21.280]  she wants more than anything to be governor of georgia and so don't i mean it'd be foolish to
[2:39:21.280 --> 2:39:27.040]  think she wouldn't do this um and and help this to happen again so i'm i'm just starting to make
[2:39:27.040 --> 2:39:31.680]  phone calls i've been making phone calls and i want people to give me an answer on why we are not
[2:39:31.680 --> 2:39:35.760]  using this method uh the people at true the vote should have never had to spend the money to do it
[2:39:35.760 --> 2:39:41.520]  in the first place we should have the people that their jobs to you know uphold the law and prosecute
[2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:46.720]  criminals i want them to do it and absolutely let me ask you this with with 183 days out from
[2:39:46.720 --> 2:39:51.840]  this midterm all the political science and numbers show biggest political political realignment in
[2:39:51.840 --> 2:39:56.000]  us history it was already happening in the last six seven years but the attempts to suppress this
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:40:00.320]  have only supercharged it now we're seeing double triple the numbers in blacks and hispanics and
[2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:04.640]  they're gonna vote republican uh democratic voters and record levels uh said they're gonna vote
[2:40:04.640 --> 2:40:10.320]  republican what's the deep state democratic party gonna do you're up there around these swamp
[2:40:10.320 --> 2:40:14.400]  creatures all day long uh what are they planning to do to try to stop this because i know they don't
[2:40:14.400 --> 2:40:20.000]  want this this this landslide to happen well they've got to blame putin of course they've
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:25.680]  got to blame putin and blame the war in ukraine uh for the high inflation and the high gas prices
[2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:31.760]  and everybody knows that is a load of bs no one is buying it these this inflation started happening
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:37.120]  before this the gas prices were going out of control before that happened and you know i'm out here
[2:40:37.120 --> 2:40:43.200]  in my district it's it's absolutely beautiful and i've been talking to farmers uh day after day
[2:40:43.200 --> 2:40:49.440]  alex and i can't tell you how much trouble farmers are in right now because this inflation and and
[2:40:49.440 --> 2:40:55.200]  the cost of fuel going up has has made their jobs that are already difficult um a lot of times
[2:40:55.200 --> 2:41:00.880]  farmers have been barely getting by for decades now because of government regulations and and all
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:06.240]  the stuff that goes on with it that makes it difficult but now inflation and gas prices is
[2:41:06.240 --> 2:41:10.320]  making it to where many of them are talking about going out of business cattle farmers are talking
[2:41:10.320 --> 2:41:15.120]  about selling their cattle at the end of the season and never been able to be cattle farmers
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:21.360]  anymore chicken integrators small farms they are crumbling and i want to tell you how scary this is
[2:41:21.360 --> 2:41:29.040]  because our food security is our national security food security is national security alex and when
[2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:34.160]  our government leaders are making it impossible for farmers to be able to continue to farm when they
[2:41:34.160 --> 2:41:41.520]  make it impossible for cattle farmers to be able to afford to to grow and and bale hay and and grow
[2:41:41.520 --> 2:41:47.040]  their animals and feed them and and sell them at market to make a profit they are failing the best
[2:41:47.040 --> 2:41:52.960]  people in in our country because our farmers are they stand for all of our values traditional family
[2:41:52.960 --> 2:41:59.360]  values freedom independence the ability to live um and sustain yourself and your family off the land

[2:42:05.200 --> 2:42:11.520]  critical part of the fabric of america and that is our farmers and i'm so upset about this it has
[2:42:11.520 --> 2:42:16.960]  me so angry but they're doing it on purpose i mean they want they want to be the global economy
[2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:22.720]  they want to be completely involved and here we have these random supposedly accidental fires at

[2:47:16.080 --> 2:47:20.160]  minutes stop on the side of the road to speak to us to talk about the outrageous nature of the
[2:47:20.160 --> 2:47:24.000]  democratic party lawyers all over the country trying to keep congress members from running for
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:31.680]  congress who to be reelected because they dare question the 2020 election proving that they
[2:47:31.680 --> 2:47:36.720]  want to steal elections it's just unbelievable oh you're you're saying we want to steal elections
[2:47:36.720 --> 2:47:41.440]  so you can't run for election when our own state department goes around the world trying to mind
[2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:45.520]  other people's elections but we can't even pass our own state department rules here in the united
[2:47:45.520 --> 2:47:51.440]  states but you were getting into something mtg really central here and that is these giant
[2:47:51.440 --> 2:47:57.440]  distribution centers and food factories and processing facilities blowing up and burning up
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:04.560]  every day statistically impossible you've got a lot of connections a lot of intel we look at the
[2:48:04.560 --> 2:48:09.120]  pipelines being shut down the dollar being devalued the clout and pivot strategy to bring america to
[2:48:09.120 --> 2:48:14.000]  its knees by destroying capitalism by sabotage that's what this is i mean there's so many signs
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:19.600]  of it everywhere what do you think's really going on and what are you hearing well i think i think
[2:48:19.600 --> 2:48:25.440]  people are beginning to to realize there this may be more than just a coincidence and i can tell you
[2:48:25.440 --> 2:48:31.360]  you know manufacturing plants it is common to that there can be fires it sometimes if a manufacturing
[2:48:31.360 --> 2:48:36.800]  plant is old occasionally a fire will happen but this is such a common occurrence right now
[2:48:36.800 --> 2:48:42.560]  especially in the past few months alex it doesn't seem to be a coincidence and it shouldn't be happening
[2:48:42.560 --> 2:48:47.840]  and why is it food processing plants over and over and over like you're talking about and it's
[2:48:47.840 --> 2:48:53.840]  extremely concerning at a time where inflation is out of control food prices are already so expensive
[2:48:54.640 --> 2:49:00.320]  and farmers are suffering and we're looking at looking at the real possibility of food shortages
[2:49:00.320 --> 2:49:06.160]  this summer just because of the the way the biden administration has completely mismanaged america's
[2:49:06.160 --> 2:49:11.600]  economy i think everyone should be concerned about this is certainly something that i'm paying
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:17.760]  attention to my team is starting to ask questions on and i i don't think it's you know i i don't want
[2:49:17.760 --> 2:49:23.920]  to speculate but it's there's too many food processing plants this is happening that and it's
[2:49:23.920 --> 2:49:29.680]  too frequent of an occurrence and no one in charge seems to care we don't see the fbi or
[2:49:29.680 --> 2:49:34.960]  department of justice you don't see people holding press conferences saying what is going on you know
[2:49:34.960 --> 2:49:40.880]  we've got mothers at grocery stores crying because they can't find baby formula which is just uh
[2:49:40.880 --> 2:49:45.680]  horrendous and heartbreaking um but but i think we have a real crisis on our hands and i think
[2:49:45.680 --> 2:49:50.320]  it's something that people need to pay serious attention to and demand investigations happen
[2:49:50.320 --> 2:49:54.880]  well that's right maybe the fbi wasn't using thousands and thousands of ages to harass january
[2:49:54.880 --> 2:50:00.000]  six peaceful protesters we would have answers or we know about all the increases in child
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:04.560]  smuggling on the border i want to hit one more topic the big disinformation board run by
[2:50:04.560 --> 2:50:09.760]  george soros mayorkas was in front of the senate last week there's a short clip of senator paul
[2:50:09.760 --> 2:50:17.120]  destroying him policies do we have guard rails do we have you but here's the problem where we
[2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:21.760]  can't even agree we can't even agree what disinformation is this is you can't even agree
[2:50:21.760 --> 2:50:25.760]  that it was disinformation that the russians fed information to the steel dossier if you
[2:50:25.760 --> 2:50:29.600]  can't agree to that how are we ever going to come to an agreement on what is disinformation so you
[2:50:29.600 --> 2:50:34.960]  can police it on social media i think you've got no idea what disinformation is and i don't think
[2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:38.720]  the government's capable of it do you know who the greatest propagator of disinformation in
[2:50:38.720 --> 2:50:44.400]  history of the world is the u.s. government are you familiar with mac namara the pentagon papers
[2:50:45.360 --> 2:50:49.200]  are you familiar with george w bush and the weapons of mass destruction
[2:50:49.200 --> 2:50:54.960]  are you familiar with iran contra i mean think of all the debates and disputes we've had over the
[2:50:54.960 --> 2:51:00.800]  last 50 years in our country we work them out by debating them we don't work them out by the
[2:51:00.800 --> 2:51:05.040]  government being the arbiter i don't want you to record brails i want you to have nothing to do
[2:51:05.040 --> 2:51:11.040]  with speech you think we can't determine you know speech by traffickers is disinformation
[2:51:11.040 --> 2:51:15.280]  you think the american people are so stupid they need you to tell them what the truth is you can't
[2:51:15.280 --> 2:51:19.520]  even admit what the truth is with the steel dossier i don't trust government to figure out what the
[2:51:19.520 --> 2:51:26.640]  truth is so government is largely disseminating disinformation government is the largest disseminator
[2:51:26.640 --> 2:51:30.880]  of disinformation there's no doubt about that the mainstream media lies on purpose and has the lowest
[2:51:30.880 --> 2:51:34.800]  approval ready with the public anywhere so it's preposterous when you pull back that they want to
[2:51:34.800 --> 2:51:38.960]  disqualify you for running for office for no reason uh they want to censor everybody with
[2:51:38.960 --> 2:51:44.080]  a censorship board a literal ministry of truth i know there's calls in congress to block this
[2:51:44.080 --> 2:51:50.320]  where do you see that going congresswoman well i just want to say god bless rand Paul you know
[2:51:50.320 --> 2:51:55.760]  he just said it that i haven't seen that clip yet that's fantastic i mean what about misinformation
[2:51:55.760 --> 2:52:00.480]  i love it that he brought up weapons of mass destruction leading the united states into
[2:52:00.480 --> 2:52:08.320]  invading iraq after uh 19 terrorists from saudi arabia you know pulled off 9 11 so let you know
[2:52:08.320 --> 2:52:12.640]  there's so many things you can't trust the government but uh they shouldn't be in charge of
[2:52:12.640 --> 2:52:17.760]  what's information what's not misinformation senator paul is he's completely correct the
[2:52:17.760 --> 2:52:23.120]  government is the biggest distributor of misinformation uh so we don't want their ministry
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:29.840]  of truth it's it's not 1984 we're in 2022 and we really don't want that that type of communism in
[2:52:29.840 --> 2:52:35.680]  america um so i think i think 20 i don't i think the november elections can't come quick enough
[2:52:35.680 --> 2:52:41.680]  alex and i think people are eyes wide open i think the democrats are going to be shocked
[2:52:41.680 --> 2:52:48.000]  that that voters don't really feel like the bots and the trolls and the little activists on twitter
[2:52:48.640 --> 2:52:52.160]  say they feel uh they're gonna they're gonna find out something different and that's why
[2:52:52.160 --> 2:52:57.200]  they're in a race to bankrupt the country and have it in such disarray try to cause a civil war over
[2:52:57.200 --> 2:53:01.680]  this rov way dang that we're all distracted by that but it's not gonna work how do people find

[2:55:41.280 --> 2:55:46.160]  talk about this for a few months because i wanted to wait give them a chance to go back on it power
[2:55:46.160 --> 2:55:51.760]  reviews is one of the largest online third party review sites in the world we had them for a decade
[2:55:52.480 --> 2:55:57.200]  and we had hundreds of thousands of five star reviews things like x2 had over seven thousand
[2:55:57.200 --> 2:56:04.000]  five star reviews and ninety nine percent approval rating and it got sold to a leftist company
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:12.160]  and they said we're not going to let you have your reviews real reviews real people third party site
[2:56:12.160 --> 2:56:20.240]  vetted confirmed and gone every piece of software everything we have taken away so that you can't
[2:56:20.240 --> 2:56:26.000]  write a review so that people can't see those five stars and so that people can't see that information
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:34.320]  and so that folks can't come together and promote a product but you're still going to do it word
[2:56:34.320 --> 2:56:39.520]  of mouth you're not going to let them stop us but that didn't hurt the site losing that and then we
[2:56:39.520 --> 2:56:42.880]  fought with them and said can we at least have the old reviews and they oh yeah we'll give it to
[2:56:42.880 --> 2:56:49.040]  you never did so you think about that and by the way you gotta pay for the service so it's a third
[2:56:49.040 --> 2:56:53.600]  party vetting system they make sure you bought it they do spot checks to make sure you did the review
[2:56:53.600 --> 2:57:00.480]  and they took it away from us folks we paid for it every year fifty something thousand dollars you
[2:57:00.480 --> 2:57:05.360]  think well I pay for that because you need reviews and I guess we can create our own review system
[2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:09.440]  but that's why we're busy that's why we need more money that's why we're constantly fighting

[3:00:33.360 --> 3:00:38.960]  here in the you know that's an idea to have kids singing the national anthem and uh kids uh
[3:00:38.960 --> 3:00:44.960]  doing the pledge of allegiance is that that really hits home with us um but i wanted to call and say
[3:00:45.600 --> 3:00:52.240]  we need more of the uh the infowars stickers that just has you know the the black and light
[3:00:52.240 --> 3:00:56.800]  because last time i did it at work we filled the work and we've had so much turnover
[3:00:57.680 --> 3:01:00.800]  it's time to do it again because they're starting about bringing the mask back
[3:01:00.800 --> 3:01:09.440]  uh at my job and everything so in a factory i just say things like who is carl swab who is
[3:01:09.440 --> 3:01:14.080]  a world economic forum and the people that are watching the news like tugger crawls and they
[3:01:14.080 --> 3:01:18.000]  come to me and they're like how do you how do you know about this stuff tugger crawls and
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:22.000]  just talked about that and you've been saying it for weeks i'm like i'm telling you infowars please
[3:01:22.560 --> 3:01:29.600]  please go to the site please listen and we're gonna fill the whole plan up with infowars stickers
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:36.960]  again for the second time but we need that infowars sticker pack you sold them a few years ago
[3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:41.840]  and we did it during the the 2016 election where you have i will gear up with a bunch of extra
[3:01:41.840 --> 3:01:46.880]  stickers and then we'll sell like 50 packs and 100 packs at cost and also did a deal where anybody
[3:01:46.880 --> 3:01:52.080]  that emailed us we i think we gave them 100 stickers or something now that was back when we
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:58.000]  had a little extra money but uh that's definitely an effective way and yes the the main way we get
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:03.520]  new people to tune in and wake up which then is a chain reaction is you doing it word of mouth so
[3:02:03.520 --> 3:02:09.680]  that's beautiful and i really appreciate it michael anything else uh yeah and when people
[3:02:09.680 --> 3:02:15.040]  when the other one other infowars are handing out these stickers think about people who are like
[3:02:15.040 --> 3:02:20.400]  right on the verge of it like people that are waking up and know something is going on like
[3:02:20.400 --> 3:02:25.040]  go to your grocery store where they sell canning supplies slip on in the canning supplies and
[3:02:25.040 --> 3:02:30.720]  it's that go to your gun store slip it in equipment you know stuff like that just keep handing it out
[3:02:30.720 --> 3:02:35.840]  and keep questioning things and keep saying things to people so when they hear it they're like how
[3:02:35.840 --> 3:02:40.400]  did you know that and then hand them the sticker as the quicker we wake everybody up the quicker we
[3:02:40.400 --> 3:02:46.960]  can stop this i agree every order gets some stickers in it but we need to do we need to do a sticker
[3:02:46.960 --> 3:02:53.520]  operation uh where we put like 100 stickers in there at cost uh and then and then everybody that
[3:02:53.520 --> 3:02:56.880]  wants to take action gets it we also have those little sheets have a bunch of little stickers on
[3:02:56.880 --> 3:03:02.560]  them those are very very very effective but the media is the virus infowars.com we've got hundreds
[3:03:02.560 --> 3:03:07.360]  of great stickers and they're all over the place and it really unifies people it lets folks know
[3:03:07.360 --> 3:03:11.840]  other people are awake and you're right it's a it's a it's a game of numbers people are really
[3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:16.800]  waking up now with all the tyranny and you're right the lockdowns are coming back they admit
[3:03:16.800 --> 3:03:22.160]  they are they're gearing them up we got to keep pushing and exposing coban and the culprits now
[3:03:22.160 --> 3:03:25.920]  but that's a classic tactic attack attack attack back off so we go back to sleep
[3:03:25.920 --> 3:03:32.400]  then they're gonna attack again also uh tom mcdonald's new song the system you guys should play it

[3:06:40.240 --> 3:06:45.120]  the point i wanted to make and i i know you've talked a lot about cloth slab and bill gates and
[3:06:45.120 --> 3:06:52.480]  the new world order and you know obviously they're paying quite a huge part in all this um i guess
[3:06:53.360 --> 3:07:00.480]  a while back when i was a kid my mom always just you know china buying up everything in this country
[3:07:00.480 --> 3:07:05.200]  and you know the kid you don't really pay attention to it you know company is going out of business
[3:07:05.200 --> 3:07:13.040]  and this and that um but as an adult now looking at things and and everything around us i guess we
[3:07:13.040 --> 3:07:22.160]  can't get away from the focus that china is playing in all of this um i got you know just from
[3:07:22.160 --> 3:07:28.160]  you know japan's comforter you know the 10 for the big guy the uh boston the foreign intelligence
[3:07:28.160 --> 3:07:35.760]  committee that eric solwell was in the chinese spy um trunk shut down the uh that houston embassy
[3:07:35.760 --> 3:07:41.120]  because they have chinese yeah one of the good things trump did was go after the chinese spies
[3:07:41.120 --> 3:07:46.000]  well sir when you say china's the heart of it you're totally correct it was the globalist in
[3:07:46.000 --> 3:07:51.040]  the 70s set up china set up one-sided trade deals show bill gates claus schwaab george
[3:07:51.040 --> 3:07:58.400]  herbert walker bush henry kissinger all of them set up china and uh charlie munger brags about
[3:07:58.400 --> 3:08:03.680]  that that's bill gates lawyer almost 100 years old about how they set up china and china's the model
[3:08:03.680 --> 3:08:08.880]  and china's going to take over and the cfr says that so yes globalist middlemen that trump talked
[3:08:08.880 --> 3:08:14.480]  about worked with china and her allied against america with china and they let china release
[3:08:14.480 --> 3:08:19.600]  the virus along with them and have the lockdowns and all that is highly coordinated and most of
[3:08:19.600 --> 3:08:24.080]  democrats in congress are literally double agents of the chinese you're totally right
[3:08:26.720 --> 3:08:34.240]  yeah and i a couple key things that's like these m and r m on a vaccine china never used them
[3:08:34.240 --> 3:08:39.440]  yeah that's right it's a bio weapon against us china and russia are not using it great point
[3:08:41.120 --> 3:08:47.280]  and uh i'll just make one other point quickly about cryptocurrency i really think that people
[3:08:47.280 --> 3:08:52.480]  should think twice about it and kind of stay towards precious metals just because it's all
[3:08:52.480 --> 3:08:57.040]  based on use of the internet well if we ever reach a point where there is no internet there is no
[3:08:57.040 --> 3:09:03.120]  crypto sure for me it's just another option and obviously it's going to go up and down uh and it's
[3:09:03.120 --> 3:09:08.320]  it's way down right now but i just i don't want a central government cryptocurrency uh that is
[3:09:08.320 --> 3:09:14.240]  a programmable token i want free market open wide diverse systems thank you so much i really
[3:09:14.240 --> 3:09:18.400]  appreciate your points but yes gold and silver are a smart move obviously all right here's a

[3:11:28.480 --> 3:11:36.480]  is m i s s misinformation yeah you read one of the hacks that they're putting up there is
[3:11:36.480 --> 3:11:43.200]  on that uh to make sure that we say only what they tell us to say and then there's that other one over
[3:11:43.200 --> 3:11:51.440]  there that's going to be leading the charge uh that uh it's a it's a freak show misinformation and
[3:11:51.440 --> 3:11:57.200]  can you imagine you're not allowed to think for yourself that's against the law now how dare you
[3:11:57.200 --> 3:12:04.320]  not swallow there we go misinformation yeah they'll tell you what to think they know best
[3:12:04.880 --> 3:12:10.960]  you're too stupid to think for yourself think for yourself is prohibited not allowed anymore
[3:12:10.960 --> 3:12:19.840]  in the ussa and um yeah i was thinking about if you want to see how messed up this this country is
[3:12:21.680 --> 3:12:28.720]  boy this this is a this is a quote from the daily mail five biden family members have been
[3:12:29.280 --> 3:12:38.080]  to rehab the drug addiction or alcohol abuse uh five members
[3:12:38.080 --> 3:12:47.040]  so this guy has trouble raising his family and he's going to run the united states
[3:12:48.960 --> 3:12:55.840]  you know by their deeds you shall know them every day every day i thank my mother and father
[3:12:55.840 --> 3:13:03.200]  and all the aunts and uncles and the ancestors made their souls rest in peace every day i say oh
[3:13:03.200 --> 3:13:10.560]  thank you for all you've given me i'm only me because of what you gave me and i couldn't hold
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:18.240]  a candle to them what they had to go through you know back in the day as immigrants but you had
[3:13:18.240 --> 3:13:23.520]  an opportunity back then but anyway as i say if your mother was a drug addict and you didn't know
[3:13:23.520 --> 3:13:30.480]  who your father was you think you'd have a shot or the government's education system will help you
[3:13:30.480 --> 3:13:37.280]  you know saving you know i'm only me because of where i came from and so biden's kids
[3:13:38.960 --> 3:13:44.480]  and getting by what they're saying are only them from where they came from
[3:13:45.680 --> 3:13:53.360]  so this guy when you see is you know the coked out kid there and and how whacked out he is
[3:13:53.360 --> 3:14:00.720]  it's hunter always hunting for money again getting the job with barisma energy in ukraine
[3:14:01.280 --> 3:14:05.840]  right after the united states over through the democratically elected government the viktor
[3:14:05.840 --> 3:14:19.360]  janikovic back in 2014 him christ signs from the hind 57 family and that was uh what's his name is
[3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:32.240]  there uh john carry another boy another arrogant little boy is his stepson and another guy made
[3:14:32.240 --> 3:14:38.720]  all these millions of dollars with barisma energy but again this is who's leading us it's a freak
[3:14:38.720 --> 3:14:46.160]  show you know it's howdy duty time you know it's one freak after another yesterday they had this
[3:14:46.160 --> 3:14:52.720]  sunday they had the big ceremony for the election of macron the little cazone over there in france
[3:14:53.760 --> 3:15:00.640]  and all these guys dressed up in the with that drag you know from way back when with those
[3:15:00.640 --> 3:15:07.520]  hats and all that stuff and saluting and rolling out the red carpet it's a freak show right in
[3:15:07.520 --> 3:15:13.760]  front of your eyes and the freaks are running the world and they're running us to death look
[3:15:13.760 --> 3:15:20.720]  at that clown boris johnson again hentany freed is one of the best artists anywhere i said to him
[3:15:20.720 --> 3:15:26.800]  as great an artist as you are if i told you make the biggest clown you ever could come up with
[3:15:28.160 --> 3:15:36.080]  and make him the prime minister of the uk you couldn't do it you couldn't match the
[3:15:36.080 --> 3:15:44.640]  clown that you got there now so we have to unite for peace and freedom and justice because if we
[3:15:44.640 --> 3:15:50.800]  don't it's going to be hell on earth and you need to support info was because misinformation is going
[3:15:50.800 --> 3:15:57.920]  to get you with the world awakening i think what's important that we were on the momentum right now
[3:15:57.920 --> 3:16:02.160]  take advantage of this moment and i have all of an idea that something everybody can do with every
[3:16:02.160 --> 3:16:06.480]  listener can do i think it'd be powerful and effective for us to uh you know hang the banners
[3:16:06.480 --> 3:16:11.280]  over highways imagine a champion artist in a way up made up it says alex jones is right
[3:16:11.280 --> 3:16:16.160]  in the war stop carmer we stand with the truckers or rest out or whatever it's brother i'm so glad

[3:16:26.960 --> 3:16:31.520]  and it will be a chain reaction what do you recommend people say on these banner hangs i have a few
[3:16:31.520 --> 3:16:39.680]  ideas rest out the vaccine is poison there's kinds of things i say just keep it short keep it

[3:19:52.320 --> 3:20:13.280]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:20:13.280 --> 3:20:28.320]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show with gerald salente
[3:20:30.560 --> 3:20:36.080]  hey everyone thanks for having me on the alex jones show and you just saw misinformation over
[3:20:36.080 --> 3:20:41.600]  there you know this is again it's a freak show we got freaks running and ruining our lives right in
[3:20:41.600 --> 3:20:49.520]  front of your eyes you know and and and people tolerate it and that's why you have to support
[3:20:49.520 --> 3:20:58.080]  info wars because we are on the cusp of world war three you know i keep thinking about this i
[3:20:58.080 --> 3:21:03.920]  say the 20th century was the american century unfortunately the 21st century is going to be
[3:21:03.920 --> 3:21:10.720]  the chinese century and one of the main reasons is the business of china is business and the
[3:21:10.720 --> 3:21:17.760]  business of america has been war and that's all they're talking about now is war so let's
[3:21:17.760 --> 3:21:25.040]  look at the equity markets look how they've been in a downspin today they were down over 500 points
[3:21:25.040 --> 3:21:31.280]  now they're down 300 and something points last week was a freak show and why because they're
[3:21:31.280 --> 3:21:37.120]  going to raise interest rates just a little bit when we have inflation skyrocketing at 8.5 percent
[3:21:37.120 --> 3:21:47.520]  even a 75 basis point interest rate is nothing when you have an 8.5 percent inflation rate
[3:21:48.320 --> 3:21:55.440]  and according to the imf the international mafia a monetary fund they say that you have to
[3:21:55.440 --> 3:22:00.800]  have interest rates one percentage point above the inflation rate to bring down inflation
[3:22:00.800 --> 3:22:09.280]  so you're looking now goal taking a hit bitcoin oil
[3:22:11.680 --> 3:22:17.360]  silver copper so it's saying two things
[3:22:19.600 --> 3:22:25.200]  number one it's not stagflation where it's a stagnant economy
[3:22:25.200 --> 3:22:35.280]  economy and increasing inflation it's drag flation it's a dragging down economy and rising
[3:22:36.320 --> 3:22:45.440]  inflation the dollar now is like at a 20-year high right with a 30 trillion dollar debt keep
[3:22:45.440 --> 3:22:51.040]  pumping in all this cheap money why is the dollar doing so good who's the competition
[3:22:51.040 --> 3:22:59.920]  there's no competition china is in lockdown and we became the chinese way
[3:23:01.520 --> 3:23:07.680]  they're the ones that launched the covet war italy followed and the rest of the world
[3:23:08.720 --> 3:23:14.960]  marched to their orders and now they're locking down again and that's just bringing oil prices
[3:23:14.960 --> 3:23:20.640]  down that's just bringing profits down in so many of these countries to go to china you know
[3:23:20.640 --> 3:23:30.480]  it was america have 332 million people and china only has what 1.4 billion china's locked down
[3:23:31.200 --> 3:23:40.400]  as many people as america has as a country so your gucci's and your coca-cola's and your
[3:23:40.400 --> 3:23:46.080]  nikes and all them companies over there that are making all that dough by selling the stuff to the
[3:23:46.080 --> 3:23:57.680]  chinese and i'm making it now so the lunacy you know is is beyond the reality and again you go to
[3:23:57.680 --> 3:24:05.760]  the info wars site and they had an article up there about sweden about how sweden didn't lock
[3:24:05.760 --> 3:24:14.160]  down as the other european nations did and their covet death rate is far below spain and the italy
[3:24:14.160 --> 3:24:21.040]  italy was the first to be locked down again as an italian i'm ashamed of the italians i stopped
[3:24:21.040 --> 3:24:30.240]  going there in 2015 i won my cousin vinnie got a cousin vinnie and uh we went over to the world's
[3:24:30.240 --> 3:24:39.120]  fair in melano they're brought to you by coca-cola and mcdonald's it was heartbroken it was terrible
[3:24:39.120 --> 3:24:46.160]  and the new york the american thing was like going to a to a diner you know it's just nothing
[3:24:46.720 --> 3:24:52.160]  the food there was disgrace but anyway yeah i got italian friends there and i you know they
[3:24:52.160 --> 3:24:57.280]  can't plane i can't cut down a tree i can't paint my house the color i want i can't do this i can't
[3:24:57.280 --> 3:25:03.280]  do that the bureaucracy is so bad and i say to them i said what are you what are you doing you're
[3:25:03.280 --> 3:25:09.280]  gonna do about it what are we gonna do what are we gonna do i lost my heart one time the italians
[3:25:09.280 --> 3:25:16.480]  used to be fighters no more and they let a clown a guy material before before droggy the banks
[3:25:16.480 --> 3:25:23.280]  that it's in there locking down the place got a much higher death rate than sweden and again it all
[3:25:23.280 --> 3:25:29.680]  goes back to what we're talking about and then knowing about the facts rather than misinformation
[3:25:29.680 --> 3:25:42.880]  misinformation and the facts are this economy and the global economy is going down big hard
[3:25:42.880 --> 3:25:53.680]  and heavy and the sanctions have made a bad situation worse again even out of the mouth of
[3:25:53.680 --> 3:26:03.120]  biden bs biden so this won't deter putin then why are you doing them well because i'm a maniac
[3:26:04.800 --> 3:26:14.480]  all right yeah sweden suffered fewer deaths per capita than much of europe despite refusing to
[3:26:14.480 --> 3:26:19.760]  enforce strict lockdowns again we wrote about this in the trans general continually as it was happening
[3:26:19.760 --> 3:26:27.920]  and how they made fun of sweden we got freaks i got businesses dead businesses have been wiped out
[3:26:28.880 --> 3:26:35.520]  the damage that the covet was done is beyond the belief and they're not going to tell you in
[3:26:35.520 --> 3:26:44.640]  in the prostitute media and again that's why you need to support info wars the truth is hard to find
[3:26:44.640 --> 3:26:50.320]  anymore it's the same with us the truth in trends we tell you what it is what we see and then the
[3:26:50.320 --> 3:26:56.720]  models think for yourself but we don't give you one sided story like the media is doing with the
[3:26:56.720 --> 3:27:04.080]  ukraine war and when we get back we're going to talk more about that but in the meantime you got
[3:27:04.080 --> 3:27:10.880]  you have bitcoin right now at a very serious point and we have the breakout point it goes below
[3:27:10.880 --> 3:27:17.840]  this number and we've been saying this now for almost two years it's going to dive back very
[3:27:17.840 --> 3:27:24.800]  deeply and on gold i got to tell you i wouldn't have thought gold would go down as low as it is
[3:27:24.800 --> 3:27:31.760]  right now but to me gold is still the number one safe haven asset again we don't give financial
[3:27:31.760 --> 3:27:40.000]  advice and silver number two and when all else fails they take you to war and the economy's
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:48.000]  failing and they're taking us to war it's not a proxy war if i give guns to a killer
[3:27:49.200 --> 3:27:56.720]  i'm an accessory to the crime and america's accessories to the ukraine war and ukraine's
[3:27:56.720 --> 3:28:03.120]  not my trip i'm an american asked most americans to find ukraine on the map they probably go down
[3:28:03.120 --> 3:28:08.560]  in mexico what are we fighting over this we're going off for hundreds of years between these two
[3:28:08.560 --> 3:28:15.440]  it's not my war it's the war the military industrial complex that's whose war it is the war the general
[3:28:15.440 --> 3:28:20.400]  the white the eyes and how it warned us about and it's only going to continue to get worse
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:29.920]  you got this guy this chancellor over there in germany schultz ukraine will not accept the war
[3:28:29.920 --> 3:28:41.840]  and neither will we yep ukraine will prevail want to bet want to bet our trends poll on twitter 76
[3:28:41.840 --> 3:28:48.160]  percent say russia's going to win oh and little true dope up there in canada he says ukraine will

[3:35:30.480 --> 3:35:40.400]  guy trudeau trudeau over there in canada went to uh uh ukraine and he condemned the unprovoked
[3:35:40.400 --> 3:35:46.080]  military invasion but it wasn't unprovoked again we were writing about this in the trends journal
[3:35:46.080 --> 3:35:57.440]  i'm going back to let's see december four december 2014 how the united states
[3:35:58.240 --> 3:36:03.520]  overthrew the democratically elected government of ukraine viktor yanukovic because he wanted
[3:36:03.520 --> 3:36:10.320]  to deal it do a deal with putin after breaking a possible deal with the imf and the eu to
[3:36:10.320 --> 3:36:15.600]  borrow money because ukraine has been in the toilet since they broke up from the soviet union
[3:36:15.600 --> 3:36:21.840]  financially and again you know the facts are all there we've been writing about this for years here
[3:36:21.840 --> 3:36:33.120]  this is an article from the trends journal in april 30th 2014 no need for nato nato was
[3:36:33.120 --> 3:36:38.000]  gone on too long the north atlantic treaty organization was established on april fourth
[3:36:38.000 --> 3:36:44.800]  1949 as a defense alliance whose purpose was to defend western europe in the event of a soviet
[3:36:44.800 --> 3:36:51.520]  invasion as nato's first secretary general put it nato was formed in order to keep russians out of
[3:36:51.520 --> 3:36:58.000]  western europe and the americans in instead of disbanding nato when the soviet union collapsed
[3:36:58.000 --> 3:37:04.560]  in 1991 washington dramatically expanded nato in violation of the reagan gorbchev agreement
[3:37:05.120 --> 3:37:12.720]  the bill clinton and george w bush regimes added constituent parts of the former soviet empire
[3:37:12.720 --> 3:37:18.720]  to nato hungry check republic poland estonia latvia latinia slovakia slovakia bogaria
[3:37:18.720 --> 3:37:26.800]  in romania members 2014 france taken out of nato by general de gall rejoined in april
[3:37:27.840 --> 3:37:35.600]  2009 18 years after the collapse of the soviet union along with croatia and albania currently the
[3:37:35.600 --> 3:37:41.120]  obama regime is working to incorporate into nato two former soviet republics you ready
[3:37:41.120 --> 3:37:48.800]  you crane and georgia 2014 we wrote about this
[3:37:54.480 --> 3:37:58.720]  and trudeau talking about the images are horrific every day they're showing these
[3:37:58.720 --> 3:38:05.920]  horrific images in the tv and in the papers but they weren't showing a trudeau hey you little
[3:38:05.920 --> 3:38:13.200]  arrogant boy you little arrogant boy you want to go shoulder to shoulder with them go over there
[3:38:13.200 --> 3:38:20.960]  and fight or shut your fat daddy's mouth you're a nobody you're a little nothing of a clown
[3:38:21.760 --> 3:38:28.720]  you'd be nobody if daddy wasn't just in trudeau and you're just a piece of trudeau
[3:38:28.720 --> 3:38:39.440]  it's none of our business go fight little boy or shut your fat mouth and i want to make this
[3:38:39.440 --> 3:38:50.720]  clear to everybody out there including joe biden who calls himself a catholic i was raised catholic
[3:38:50.720 --> 3:38:57.760]  to jesus christ that i was taught to obey and listen to
[3:39:03.440 --> 3:39:11.840]  would be telling you you keep it up you're going to hell because jesus christ would not go
[3:39:11.840 --> 3:39:22.640]  go take a trip to alabama at lockheed martin the biggest defense contractor in the united
[3:39:22.640 --> 3:39:30.800]  states and probably the world and brag about getting more lethal weapons to go kill people
[3:39:30.800 --> 3:39:42.720]  over there in ukraine where are you catholics what christ do you believe in your christ is
[3:39:42.720 --> 3:39:53.120]  a demon it's not jesus christ and again i found it the universal church of freedom peace and
[3:39:53.120 --> 3:39:59.680]  justice and little trudeau over there yesterday was talking about bringing freedom peace and
[3:39:59.680 --> 3:40:10.800]  justice to canada yep the images are horrific hey fat mouth how about the images of america
[3:40:10.800 --> 3:40:19.120]  destroying syria how about the her ll oh in canada canada was there too with the cannons away
[3:40:19.120 --> 3:40:27.440]  slaughtering people fat mouth how about afghanistan oh maybe you can't spell that word

[3:40:35.680 --> 3:40:43.600]  no no no let me assure you afghanistan iraq oh they were fine we brought freedom and democracy
[3:40:43.600 --> 3:40:58.400]  we had democracy one after another ready for this russia's war in ukraine has backfired
[3:40:59.120 --> 3:41:10.960]  david patreus tells dw mr german news the retired army general said rather than advancing russia's
[3:41:10.960 --> 3:41:19.280]  cause the war in ukraine was making nato stronger great great he praised extraordinary steps taken
[3:41:19.280 --> 3:41:28.160]  by germany on weapons exports to kill more people and more military spending why would anybody
[3:41:28.160 --> 3:41:37.360]  patreus how about betrayed us this is another arrogant guy oh yeah we're making progress he
[3:41:37.360 --> 3:41:47.360]  said back in jan june 2011 with the afghan war making progress yeah we're really loath to use
[3:41:47.360 --> 3:41:54.320]  this very loaded term of winning or losing we've made enormous progress in a number of different
[3:41:54.320 --> 3:42:01.520]  geographic areas within afghanistan and overall the momentum has changed and you're gonna believe

[3:47:40.400 --> 3:47:46.400]  info wars and my motto the transjournal magazine think for yourself but i can tell you what i love
[3:47:46.400 --> 3:47:53.120]  uh one of the great products that was little gold bars they got over there boy they're to me gold is
[3:47:53.120 --> 3:48:03.360]  the ultimate safe haven asset my first buy of gold was i was a youngster back in 1970s my first buy
[3:48:03.360 --> 3:48:12.000]  was 187 dollars and 50 cents an ounce now it's floating around 1860 bucks and the markets uh
[3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:17.200]  they're down over 600 points when i just got back on the air over here and you take a look over there
[3:48:17.200 --> 3:48:28.160]  in in europe the the uh the euro markets were down almost three percent today and the niké index
[3:48:28.160 --> 3:48:33.760]  down almost three percent two point five and a hang sang over there really sunk it down almost
[3:48:33.760 --> 3:48:39.840]  four percent so we're going through very very difficult times and again to me safe haven assets
[3:48:39.840 --> 3:48:49.760]  are the number one in those gold bars to me uh golden so that guy betrayed us by the way that
[3:48:49.760 --> 3:48:58.080]  arrogant arrogant clown that the mainstream media quotes all right this is this is this is from him
[3:48:58.080 --> 3:49:12.800]  him back in june of 2011 betray us wrote in foreign policy magazine ready how we wanted a rock
[3:49:17.680 --> 3:49:24.960]  and they listened to these clowns and that's why you have to tune into info wars and if you

[3:51:32.480 --> 3:51:40.960]  a preemptive rebuff to the aggression this was a forced timely move and the only correct decision
[3:51:41.680 --> 3:51:48.320]  once taken by a strong and independent country he called the invasion a preemptive strike to

[3:52:21.040 --> 3:52:31.200]  they harbored completely different plans and we saw it brazil's ex-president lula zalinski

[3:53:05.360 --> 3:53:13.040]  but not a word in the prostitute media and that's why you subscribe to the trends journal

[3:54:01.920 --> 3:54:08.400]  of ukraines is on russian hands that's what they not a word about what putin's saying doesn't make
[3:54:08.400 --> 3:54:14.960]  any difference in the mainstream media and again lula said this is from time magazine
[3:54:18.000 --> 3:54:28.240]  about zalinski he did want war if he didn't want war he would have negotiated a little more and then
[3:54:28.240 --> 3:54:41.120]  lula goes on to say what i've been saying and i said earlier nobody is trying to create peace
[3:54:46.480 --> 3:54:54.480]  he also noted that people are inciting hatred toward russians and russian president vladimir
[3:54:54.480 --> 3:55:02.000]  pollute putin but that won't solve anything quote we really need to reach an agreement
[3:55:02.720 --> 3:55:12.720]  but people are encouraging war you are encouraging this guy zalinski you ready and he thinks he is
[3:55:12.720 --> 3:55:22.240]  a cherry on the cake we should have a serious conversation okay you are a nice comedian
[3:55:22.240 --> 3:55:29.120]  but let us not make war for you to show up on tv
[3:55:33.360 --> 3:55:38.320]  and he goes on to say what a clown showed is he sees the zalinski playing his role

[3:56:05.120 --> 3:56:10.960]  again i'm going to make this really clear don't call yourself a christian if you believe in jesus
[3:56:10.960 --> 3:56:19.120]  christ because jesus christ would not be recommending sending more lethal weapons to kill people ukraine
[3:56:19.120 --> 3:56:25.680]  is going to lose the war the longer they keep it going the more people that are going to be killed
[3:56:26.880 --> 3:56:33.280]  and the more destruction that's going to happen and for anybody to listen to american intelligence
[3:56:33.280 --> 3:56:39.120]  which is an oxymoron because that's all they are is now intelligent he told us about 9 11 before
