[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:54.000]  Okay ladies and gentlemen, I'm a little late here only because, well I'm not late, I've been at the desk going through all this news.
[00:54.000 --> 01:15.000]  I have a stack of news here that's probably about 30, 40 different stories all getting into how the vaccine does not work unless it's intentionally to kill you or make you sick.
[01:15.000 --> 01:28.000]  It is not working, so unless the vaccine's goal, unless the purpose of the vaccine is to kill you or make you sick or have some sort of just devastating side effect, vaccine is not working.
[01:28.000 --> 01:46.000]  I've got all the data from across the planet, the most vaccinated countries on earth are experiencing now the highest COVID outbreaks where the Nordic countries of Europe, where they don't have the vaccine mandates and they're pretty much back to normal for all intensive purposes, have no COVID.
[01:46.000 --> 01:59.000]  You look at India where they're treating with ivermectin, COVID gone, but the vaccinated countries pushing the vaccine, mass outbreaks, mass heart attacks, mass death.
[01:59.000 --> 02:14.000]  And so we've got that coming up, but it's not only that, then it's all of the COVID tyranny that they're still pressuring the planet with.
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  And so here's what it comes down to.
[02:17.000 --> 02:27.000]  And I've got videos of police and protesters clashing and now you have vaccinated versus unvaccinated clashing and it's at schools and all this stuff.
[02:27.000 --> 02:45.000]  And you see, this is what happens in any civilization that enacts illogical, unreasonable edicts and mandates.
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  You're going to see conflict, you're going to see strife, you're going to see division.
[02:51.000 --> 03:08.000]  And then you're just going to see complete madness because you, the thinking individual, you, the informed individual, you, the intellectual, you, the philosopher, you, just somebody that has common sense, logic and reasoning, you know, it's all complete garbage.
[03:08.000 --> 03:21.000]  And then you have principles and so you're not going to go along with lies, you're not, you're not going to be a victim to unreasonable and illogical mandates.
[03:21.000 --> 03:30.000]  You're not going to be pressured into giving up your bodily autonomy because of some corrupt tyrants like Fauci.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  Boy, tons of news on Fauci today too.
[03:34.000 --> 03:45.000]  More censorship is happening, corruption in our government, whether it's Pelosi or Merrick Garland is being exposed.
[03:45.000 --> 03:58.000]  And then you have Biden making moves right now, selling the country out unlike anything we've ever seen.
[03:58.000 --> 04:09.000]  So it's beyond just Afghanistan where we gave the Taliban Afghanistan, we gave them hundreds of millions of dollars, we gave them hundreds of millions of dollars of military equipment and the whole country.
[04:09.000 --> 04:17.000]  All of our treasure, all of our blood handed over to the Taliban overnight, still there are hostages over there.
[04:17.000 --> 04:33.000]  No, now Biden is making and cutting new deals with China and Afghanistan where our military equipment is now being made in China.
[04:33.000 --> 04:42.000]  And if we hadn't given enough money to Afghanistan, the Biden administration is about to give them more.
[04:42.000 --> 04:51.000]  Unbelievable. All this and more coming up on the Alex Jones show, on Infowars.com and Band.video.
[04:51.000 --> 05:20.000]  Every day you are living and you are witnessing history as the fate of mankind hangs in the balance.
[05:21.000 --> 05:36.000]  We have had real problems getting our best selling products in, some of them take up to 10 months to get in, we've had to discontinue some of our products because we just can't get the ingredients anymore.
[05:36.000 --> 05:53.000]  It's pretty scary stuff, so please take advantage of sales we're running for one week only, there's only one week left from October 11th for 7 days, kicks off October 11th on things like DNA Force Plus at 40% off, Winter Sun at 50% off, Ultra 12 at 50% off and more.
[05:53.000 --> 06:10.000]  At Infowarsstore.com, one week left, check out these incredible deals.
[06:10.000 --> 06:28.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[06:28.000 --> 06:49.000]  Alright, I am just overwhelmed here and I'm going to do my best not to get too frustrated and angry today. Simply because I consume 10 hours of news a day.
[06:49.000 --> 07:15.000]  I have gone through hundreds of articles today and I'm going to present to you in this stack of news right here how unless the goal of the COVID vaccine is to injure people and kill people and spread COVID making the vaccine variance,
[07:15.000 --> 07:32.000]  it has been a complete and utter failure. Again, unless the vaccine has been all about getting big pharma, even more rich and more powerful and more control and part of a eugenics program to call some of the population,
[07:32.000 --> 07:47.000]  injure a lot of the population and create the vaccine variance, the COVID vaccine has been such an abysmal failure. No, no, no. It's been a nightmare. It's been a disaster.
[07:47.000 --> 08:11.000]  And here's what's so frustrating. I along with the other hosts here at Infowars and Alex Jones and our guests for I don't know how long have been warning sending your loved one to the hospital with COVID is a death sentence is a death sentence.
[08:11.000 --> 08:28.000]  And now, as I'm just watching the news over the weekend, I see all of these people coming out formerly of the CDC, or the FDA, or all these other doctors and now they're going on Fox News and they're going on Newsmax and they're going on OAN.
[08:28.000 --> 08:48.000]  They're saying the CDC protocols for treating COVID are murder. Here's a headline. Nearly nine in 10 COVID-19 patients who are put on ventilators die. New York Hospital data suggests. No, no, no. That's the fact.
[08:48.000 --> 09:04.000]  That's from over a year ago. So we saw that happening a year ago. We talked to doctors. We had them as guests. We just looked at the CDC's official protocols and we said, yeah, this is going to kill people.
[09:04.000 --> 09:24.000]  And it's more than just the ventilator. It's the whole thing. It's the remdesivir. It's the ventilator. It's the not giving them oxygen. It's the not giving them hydroxychloroquine and zinc or Regeneron or ivermectin and just waiting until they're about to die and then putting it putting them on the ventilator as the final nail in the coffin.
[09:24.000 --> 09:41.000]  But see, that's the frustration here is that it's just like how they made this virus in a lab. And now people are finally admitting it. They denied it for a year. Now they're finally admitting it.
[09:41.000 --> 09:52.000]  Why does our media live in such denial? Why do our political leaders live in such denial? Why do we just the general population live in such denial?
[09:52.000 --> 10:04.000]  I mean, my God, if the shackles of denial could be removed from society, we could overturn this thing overnight. But it's denying that Anthony Fauci made the virus.
[10:04.000 --> 10:13.000]  It's denying that they worked with the Chinese military to release it as a bio weapon. It's denying that the vaccine is killing people and is part of a worldwide eugenics program.
[10:13.000 --> 10:22.000]  It's denying all of this that's put us in this position to become slaves for the rest of our existence.
[10:22.000 --> 10:33.000]  Medical tyranny is just part of slavery. My body, my choice, my body, my choice, my body, my choice. I don't want to take that vaccine.
[10:33.000 --> 10:46.000]  Oh, OK. Well, sorry, that's not your choice. You no longer get to live on planet Earth. We're going to put you into a jail cell and just wait for you to die because you don't want to comply.
[10:46.000 --> 10:58.000]  So you see, it's the denial of all of this that has put us in this position. And I get it. For half the people, they want to deny it because then you accept it, you're going to have to do something about it.
[10:58.000 --> 11:10.000]  That's kind of a big thing to admit that that's the reality. Or it's just so devastating to admit that's the case. The denial is just the comfort zone that you want to live in.
[11:10.000 --> 11:22.000]  But as the medical tyranny encroaches, as the policies from the White House are destroying our country, the denial, the comfort zone of the denial is starting to wane.
[11:22.000 --> 11:38.000]  And it's not so comfortable anymore. The liberals who can't quit lockdown. No, no, no, no. They've fully bought in. They're the cult. They would drink the Kool-Aid that Jim Jones served them.
[11:38.000 --> 11:52.000]  Anybody else is just trying to live free, live in reality. While the people that want the mass and want the vaccines, it'll never stop for them. You notice they're still not taking the mask off. They've had three vaccines.
[11:52.000 --> 12:02.000]  They're still demanding you wear a mask. They wear a mask. They wear the hazmat suit. They wear the alien NASA astronaut outfits and the face shields.
[12:02.000 --> 12:18.000]  Just complete insanity, complete loony tunes world, mental disabilities, Stockholm syndrome, mass psychosis worldwide. You've never seen anything like it on planet Earth.
[12:18.000 --> 12:30.000]  So that's what's frustrating is I'm going to have to sit here and go through this stack of about 30 or so articles showing how the vaccine doesn't work, showing how it's killing people, showing how it's spreading COVID.
[12:30.000 --> 12:43.000]  And they don't even deny it. That's what's even more frustrating about it. They don't even deny it. They admit all of it. You have had more deaths from COVID since the vaccine.
[12:43.000 --> 12:55.000]  Like that at face value is already something to talk about, but there's even more behind it. They inflated the COVID death numbers from 2020.
[12:55.000 --> 13:04.000]  No car accidents, gun fights, cancer, all this other stuff. They counted as COVID deaths.
[13:04.000 --> 13:15.000]  Now the numbers are even worse and they're not counting the average car accident or whatever is COVID anymore, but all of these deaths from the vaccinated, they are counting as COVID.
[13:15.000 --> 13:34.000]  So what are they going to do when the numbers come out for the year 2021? And we just hope and pray that there's enough people awake to this and we have enough leadership in Congress or somewhere else that we can maybe stop this madness.
[13:34.000 --> 13:44.000]  What are they going to do when we have the numbers from the year 2021 and the death rate is up one to 2% and it's all the vaccinated people because that's what's going to happen.
[13:44.000 --> 13:53.000]  There is no doubt anymore. In the year 2020, from the year 2019, the death rate did not go up a single percent, not one.
[13:53.000 --> 13:59.000]  Deadliest pandemic ever, they said. The death rate did not go up a single percent, not a single percent.
[13:59.000 --> 14:06.000]  But now that we have the vaccine in the year 2021, I predict I said 1% last year. I'm not thinking it's going to be 2%.
[14:06.000 --> 14:17.000]  But the death rate will go up from the year 2020 to the year 2021 and it will all be from the vaccinated people, all of it.
[14:17.000 --> 14:23.000]  And when you have Bill Gates talking about how we need to have vaccines to control the world's population, there's too many people on earth.
[14:23.000 --> 14:30.000]  The same people that are saying climate change is the biggest issue. Man-made climate change, we need to get carbon emissions down to zero.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  That's you. That's getting the population down to zero.
[14:35.000 --> 14:43.000]  So they're already admitting, I mean, look, there's a headline right there, CBS News, more COVID deaths in the year 2021 than the year 2020.
[14:43.000 --> 14:51.000]  And see, I could go off onto another bent and get into the liberal nonsense of it or the political nonsense of it and say,
[14:51.000 --> 14:58.000]  you blamed every COVID death on Trump in the year 2020. Why won't you blame all of this on Biden? How come it's not Biden's fault?
[14:58.000 --> 15:08.000]  Look, you hypocrites. Look, you double standard fools. But that's like drinking poison water. There's no victory there.
[15:08.000 --> 15:14.000]  It's only going to kill you. The left is never going to be sane. The left is never going to be rational.
[15:14.000 --> 15:20.000]  The Democrat voters are never going to be honest. They're gone. They're gone. They've sold their soul. They've detached from reality.
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.000]  They live in the fantasy land. They're completely brainwashed and owned by the television.
[15:25.000 --> 15:33.000]  So none of it even matters. Oh, blame Trump for everything, but Biden's completely innocent. That's their logic.
[15:33.000 --> 15:38.000]  So I'm going to have to get focused and I'm just going to start Paul driving through this news when we come back.
[15:38.000 --> 15:45.000]  But let me just explain. There is zero doubt. There can be zero doubt. The vaccines are either safe or effective.
[15:45.000 --> 15:56.000]  And if the vaccines are doing anything right now, it's causing people to have devastating side effects and killing tens of thousands of people that we know of.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  There is no doubt that's what's going on.
[15:58.000 --> 16:06.000]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:06.000 --> 16:11.000]  Here's why. We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:11.000 --> 16:16.000]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:16.000 --> 16:25.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:25.000 --> 16:34.000]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:34.000 --> 16:44.000]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too. Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[16:46.000 --> 16:54.000]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.

[18:18.000 --> 18:21.000]  It actually makes your telomeres last longer.
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.000]  It doesn't make them grow, but makes them last longer in the space of the same thing.
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.000]  So it's as close to the fountain of youth as you're going to get.
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.000]  Well, DNA Force Plus has been sold out for six months.

[18:49.000 --> 18:50.000]  It's amazing.

[18:52.000 --> 18:59.000]  And for those of you that love it, it's back in stock 40% off exclusively at infowarstore.com, DNA Force Plus.
[18:59.000 --> 19:08.000]  The engineers at BioProse are very excited to announce a major expansion of new products into the retail consumer market.
[19:08.000 --> 19:14.000]  Since their rollout of their first product almost a year ago, they come out with four new products.
[19:14.000 --> 19:21.000]  BioDrain Pro, BioRV Pro, BioMarine Pro, and BioPorta Pro.
[19:21.000 --> 19:28.000]  For decades, oil companies and other major chemical corporations have been using patented, naturally occurring,
[19:28.000 --> 19:35.000]  specially bred bacteria to eat oil spills and other toxic waste disasters.
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.000]  That's how powerful these naturally occurring microbes are.
[19:39.000 --> 19:44.000]  The BioProse system is light years better than traditional enzymes that only work once.
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.000]  These bacteria begin to breed and live in your septic tank.
[19:48.000 --> 20:09.000]  And now it's available for the general public's use for the first time on the retail market, exclusively available at thebioprose.com.
[20:09.000 --> 20:19.000]  The Vinsville family with children four and five years old say they were accidentally given full adult doses of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine instead of flu shots.
[20:19.000 --> 20:23.000]  They say it happened on October 4th at the Walgreens on St. Joseph Avenue.
[20:23.000 --> 20:30.000]  The family of four includes two adults and two young children, both too young for the Pfizer or any other COVID vaccine.
[20:30.000 --> 20:37.000]  Well, the family's attorney, Daniel Thule, shared with us what he says are vaccination cards given to the family by Walgreens.
[20:37.000 --> 20:43.000]  They show children born in 2016 and 2017 were given a Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
[20:43.000 --> 20:51.000]  The family says they left the pharmacy thinking they had gotten their flu shots, but a Walgreens employee later called them and said they had made a mistake.
[20:51.000 --> 20:58.000]  Thule says the children have been taken to a pediatric cardiologist and the family was told both are showing signs of heart issues.
[20:58.000 --> 21:02.000]  We've reached out to Walgreens several times but have not yet heard back.
[21:02.000 --> 21:09.000]  So there you go. Oops, gave you a COVID vaccine. Oh, now you have heart failure. Sorry. Sorry, little boys.
[21:09.000 --> 21:15.000]  You're never going to live a full life now. You're going to have health problems the rest of your life and your heart's messed up because of the COVID vaccine.
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  Our bad. Sorry.
[21:17.000 --> 21:21.000]  And then the media reach out for comment. No comment. Sorry. Yeah.
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.000]  Or they should comment. They should just call and say, what are you surprised about?
[21:25.000 --> 21:31.000]  This is happening to kids. It's happening to adults, middle-aged athletes. Everybody's having heart problems from this vaccine.
[21:31.000 --> 21:37.000]  It says it's the number one side effect. It's myocarditis, paracarditis. We have all the data. You should have known.
[21:37.000 --> 21:46.000]  You came to get a Pfizer COVID jab? Absolutely. You're going to have heart problems. You might die. What are you mad at us for?
[21:46.000 --> 21:55.000]  You wanted this vaccine. Oh, you were lied to about it. Oh, you were deceived. That's not our fault. That's not our fault.
[21:55.000 --> 22:01.000]  You should have done your research. Wow.
[22:01.000 --> 22:12.000]  Israeli data favor higher estimate of post-vax myocarditis. So results echo the controversial. Controversial VAERS study. Controversial.
[22:12.000 --> 22:20.000]  Yeah, controversial. It's just raw data. It's so controversial. It's raw data, but it doesn't go the way the mainstream media owned by Big Pharma wants it to go.
[22:20.000 --> 22:30.000]  So it's controversial. Just raw data showing the vaccine's mass heart failure after them. But that's controversial to talk about.
[22:30.000 --> 22:41.000]  You don't want to make people scared. We do want to make people scared of COVID, but not the vaccine. Come on. That's not the agenda here.
[22:41.000 --> 23:00.000]  So I'm going to try to calm down and relax and just cover this news. But see, I could put myself in the right mindset and just say, well,
[23:00.000 --> 23:11.000]  yeah, there's going to be a lot of people that die from this vaccine, but I'm going to be better off because I'm going to be healthy and I'm going to survive this. But I'm not an evil person.
[23:11.000 --> 23:21.000]  I don't like seeing innocent people being deceived and put into a eugenics program without their consent. I don't like people being part of a medical experiment without their consent.
[23:21.000 --> 23:33.000]  That's illegal. That's evil. I don't like that. But if I did like it, I would sit here and celebrate. I mean, I would sit here and be like, haha, look at all you dummies taking the vaccine and dying, haha.
[23:33.000 --> 23:46.000]  But see, that's that's the fool that laughs at the plight of his neighbor, of his brother, of his fellow human without understanding that that fate is also your fate.
[23:46.000 --> 23:57.000]  And so the crew is just pulling up all these different stories and headlines of the vaccine side effects. But I just can't emphasize this enough.
[23:57.000 --> 24:04.000]  Being here, covering this for over a year and a half.
[24:04.000 --> 24:17.000]  It's not about the risk of being redundant. It is complete redundancy. But the mainstream media still won't even admit it. Even alternative media that gets things right most of the time or isn't out to get you.
[24:17.000 --> 24:26.000]  Even there just years behind info wars because look, I understand in media you want to be patient. You want to make sure that the story coming out is real.
[24:26.000 --> 24:36.000]  And then you know what? That's fine. That's respectable. But there's this there's this notion that as soon as info wars reported, it's fake news doesn't matter that it always ends up coming true.
[24:36.000 --> 24:45.000]  And the vaccines are the best example. So let's just let me just let me just focus and try to get through this stack of news as quickly as I can and Alex Jones joining us in the next segment.
[24:45.000 --> 24:54.000]  Now, this is a New York Times science reporter. And then again, this is my frustration. You think that you see these people on TV or at the New York Times or anywhere else.
[24:54.000 --> 25:00.000]  You think they're smart. You think they're smart. You think that they're credible. They're not they're dumb and they're liars.
[25:00.000 --> 25:09.000]  This is the New York Times science reporter up over a man to belly in May of this year in May.
[25:09.000 --> 25:18.000]  Someday we will stop talking about the lab leak theory and maybe even admit it's racist roots. But alas, that day is not yet here.
[25:18.000 --> 25:28.000]  Yeah, a poover because it did come out of a lab. Everybody knows it now. Even Fauci is admitting it's it's coming out of a lab.
[25:28.000 --> 25:37.000]  But you're the New York Times science reporter and you're still in denial. And then you have an IQ that resembles that of an egg.
[25:37.000 --> 25:46.000]  And so you say racist because that's the lowest common denominator argument of the unintellectual like you a New York Times science reporter.
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  So you think, oh, New York Times science reporter must be smart, must be informed, must want to keep me informed.
[25:50.000 --> 25:56.000]  Wrong, wrong, wrong, dumb, uninformed and wants to deceive you.
[25:56.000 --> 26:06.000]  It did come out of a lab. A poover. Are you ever going to admit that? No. You're never going to admit that. Are you?
[26:06.000 --> 26:16.000]  Now let's do some juxtaposition. Here's Denmark, Norway and Sweden that have now removed all COVID restrictions.
[26:16.000 --> 26:25.000]  So to put it in a more simple way, they're not playing anymore. They're not playing COVID anymore. Hey guys, COVID was fun. We're done playing.
[26:25.000 --> 26:31.000]  We're not going to play COVID COVID anymore. We're done. We're done. And what are they seeing? Infections are down.
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  Hospitalizations are down. Spread is down. They're not doing the testing. They're not doing the lockdowns. They're not doing the mandates.
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  They're not doing the masks and COVID is pretty much gone. It's amazing, isn't it?
[26:42.000 --> 26:51.000]  The whole COVID pandemic would end tomorrow if we stopped playing, if we stopped playing.
[26:51.000 --> 26:58.000]  It's like a long board game or something. It's like a long board game of monopoly or war. It's been going on for days.
[26:58.000 --> 27:04.000]  And then everybody says, you know what? I'm over it. Let's just stop playing. Everybody says, okay. And this walks away from the table.
[27:04.000 --> 27:13.000]  And it's done. It's what they've done in the Nordic countries of Europe. They've quit playing COVID and COVID goes away. Amazing.
[27:13.000 --> 27:22.000]  Southwest Airlines flight cancellations continue, but they deny that the COVID vaccine mandate is to blame. That's a total lie, folks.
[27:22.000 --> 27:32.000]  It's all vaccine mandate walkouts. It's all vaccine mandate firings or just stopping people from going to work. They're lying.
[27:32.000 --> 27:39.000]  Everybody knows it. Oh, it's weather. How come no other flights are being delayed for weather? What weather? What cities? They don't say.
[27:39.000 --> 27:51.000]  Because, yes, the vaccine mandate walkouts have hammered the airline industry and they're in complete denial of it and they don't know what to do about it.
[27:51.000 --> 27:59.000]  Well, here's an idea. Stop mandating experimental vaccines. Stop abiding by the Biden administration tyranny.
[27:59.000 --> 28:13.000]  Now it's hitting the train industry for travel at least. Trains, this is from Amtrak. Trains 465 and 416 departing on 1010 are canceled due to unforeseen crew issues.
[28:13.000 --> 28:22.000]  Oh, unforeseen crew issues, meaning vaccine mandates and they're not getting it until they don't have the crew.
[28:22.000 --> 28:34.000]  All by design, by the way. All by design, by the way. Non-profit Catholic owned hospital denies religious exemptions for approximately 650 employees for the COVID vaccine.
[28:34.000 --> 28:40.000]  So now they're going to walk out and now you're going to have massive staff shortages at hospitals.
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  But if you want to know how insane it all is, read this headline.
[28:43.000 --> 28:55.000]  Bill's Cole Beasley, a football player, unvaccinated, forced to quarantine after testing negative for COVID because he came in contact with a fully vaccinated trainer who had the virus.
[28:55.000 --> 29:11.000]  That's the clown world we're living in right there.
[29:25.000 --> 29:33.000]  Some efficacy in immune support. Now you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[29:33.000 --> 29:43.000]  No cures or treatments there. Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called Immune 10x.
[29:43.000 --> 29:59.000]  In the best part, you can go to the StrongerDefense website right now and claim your own supply of Immune 10x without paying anything today. Crazy, right? Learn more about this unusual limited time offer at StrongerDefense.com at StrongerDefense.com.
[30:13.000 --> 30:17.000]  I've gotten back in the groove of religiously taking three products every single day.
[30:17.000 --> 30:26.000]  DNA Force Plus, it's back in stock. Also, X2, deep-growth crystal iodine that's essential for your immune system, your whole body.
[30:26.000 --> 30:37.000]  And of course, at nighttime, down and out sleep aid that makes me have deeper, cleaner, restful sleep that, again, boosts my immune system and is good for every cell in my body and great for the spirit.
[30:37.000 --> 30:46.000]  All three of these products are in stock right now. They are 40% off in the case of DNA Force Plus and 50% off for one week only on Survival Shield X2.
[30:46.000 --> 30:59.000]  And yes, until supplies last, we have down and out 50% off at infowarstore.com. This is their trifecta. I suggest you check it out and experience what this does for your body today.
[30:59.000 --> 31:11.000]  Infowar's emergency supply chain breakdown sale is only running for one week for a Monday, October 11th for seven days.
[31:11.000 --> 31:22.000]  That's because a bunch of these products that we have in stock are limited supply because obviously the supply chain breakdown that I've been warning you of now for 20 months,
[31:22.000 --> 31:27.000]  because that's part of the great reset and part of the global's plan, and that's what global lockdowns have been triggered.
[31:27.000 --> 31:34.000]  So we've not lowered the quality of any of our products. That means some of them have been sold out more than six months, like DNA Force Plus.
[31:34.000 --> 31:43.000]  It is 40% off, but coming up in one week, it will go back to full price, and we probably won't have more for up to six months, ladies and gentlemen.
[31:43.000 --> 31:50.000]  So it's a chance to support the broadcast, to get incredible products at the same time. Winter Sun, Ultra 12, they're both 50% off.
[31:50.000 --> 31:54.000]  They're going to go back to 10% off in a week as well. They're 50% off right now.
[31:54.000 --> 31:59.000]  Find these and more at infowarstore.com and fund the Info World, making your life a lot healthier.
[32:24.000 --> 32:33.000]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence, and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulate markets,
[32:33.000 --> 32:38.000]  but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[32:38.000 --> 32:45.000]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy, buying up everything,
[32:45.000 --> 32:51.000]  not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization,
[32:51.000 --> 32:57.000]  making the companies they do fund the only things left standing. This is the great reset. This is what's happening now.
[32:57.000 --> 32:59.000]  War on everyone is the only way to stop it.
[33:02.000 --> 33:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:05.000 --> 33:27.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:27.000 --> 33:39.000]  It's always important to understand when you're being bombarded by globalist propaganda that they're never going to tell us about our successes,
[33:39.000 --> 33:44.000]  they're never going to tell us about our victories, they're never going to tell us about all the tens of millions of people in the United States,
[33:44.000 --> 33:51.000]  every race, color, and creed that are really fully awake, and that that Genesis point is enough to take the whole country and the whole world back right there.
[33:51.000 --> 33:59.000]  The globalist can only operate if people are in the dark and not aware of their program. Take the fact that they're reporting that hundreds of thousands of U.S. military
[33:59.000 --> 34:06.000]  active duty are refusing to take the poison shot right now. That's huge. And so many others are told, look, if you don't do this,
[34:06.000 --> 34:15.000]  you have 14 days, you're going to be kicked out of the military. Well, now hundreds of thousands are calling that bluff because everyone's being told,
[34:15.000 --> 34:22.000]  I've talked to the troops, talked to officers, I've talked to enlisted, I've also read it right there in the statements put out by the so-called by-demonstration
[34:22.000 --> 34:29.000]  that either you take these shots, you're out in 14 days. Well, it's not the U.S. military anymore, it's the globalist military, it's the occupied government,
[34:29.000 --> 34:35.000]  and that's one way to stop this system is to simply pull out of it. Now, that's part of their plan with the purge,
[34:35.000 --> 34:43.000]  is to have a litmus test of the poison shot to make the firefighters and the police and the military quick that are good and smart and informed,
[34:43.000 --> 34:50.000]  but they weren't expecting it to be at this mass scale, this many, or this many of the air traffic controllers be doing the same thing as well,
[34:50.000 --> 34:59.000]  or the pilots, or the flight attendants. And so we're being inducted into slavery and the real power we have is solidarity together,
[34:59.000 --> 35:10.000]  saying no to the system and non-compliance. What's even more amazing is that all over the news they admit, oh, sorry, the vaccine doesn't protect you.
[35:10.000 --> 35:16.000]  In fact, you can get more sick if you don't take the booster shot now, and all the statistics come out from around the world.
[35:16.000 --> 35:26.000]  John Hopkins has correlated them and collated them, but put them all together, and it shows unequivocally that the vast majority of people that are sick,
[35:26.000 --> 35:33.000]  being hospitalized and dying, have taken the poison death shot, as Dr. Zelinko calls it. So that's where we are.
[35:33.000 --> 35:40.000]  We're living in incredibly historic times. They intend for us just to move forward under this attack and adapt to it by submitting to it.
[35:40.000 --> 35:48.000]  No, we need to adapt to it by exposing it and sending those that have done to prison. We do that by exposing the globalistly population paradigm.
[35:48.000 --> 35:55.000]  They're not even hiding it anymore. They've got the former British Finance Minister in the news today, stories up on informers.com,
[35:55.000 --> 36:03.000]  it's wonderful that people aren't having two children and we need to just voluntarily extinct ourselves. The first world needs to go away,
[36:03.000 --> 36:10.000]  because the western world's evil and white. It needs to basically be ethnically cleansed and have the third world come and replace us and take over.
[36:10.000 --> 36:16.000]  That's because the globalists have fully conquered the third world, and they've got those people on a very, very short leash.
[36:16.000 --> 36:25.000]  So, of course, they want to take the quote, Upity West, with private property rights, self-defense, and the Christian ethos away from us,
[36:25.000 --> 36:31.000]  so that their corporate synthetic system, their post-industrial, post-human system, can take over.
[36:31.000 --> 36:37.000]  So a lot of massive developments taking place, and I'll just hammer this point again. If the leaders we have that are governors, state reps,
[36:37.000 --> 36:47.000]  congressmen and women cannot focus on the fact that this is a globalist program, and just keep fighting pieces or heads of the hydra, we'll never beat it.
[36:47.000 --> 36:54.000]  But if we have an epiphany, a great awakening, which is starting to happen, to the New World Order, to Bill Gates, to Klaus Schwab, it's game over, folks.
[36:54.000 --> 37:01.000]  So when you're reaching out to strangers or friends or family or coworkers or just random people, it doesn't matter, they're all humans,
[37:01.000 --> 37:08.000]  use Bill Gates as the entryway to the discussion. Hey, you wonder why things are shut down? Hey, you wonder why the economy's falling apart?
[37:08.000 --> 37:14.000]  You know about Bill Gates, right? He wants depopulation, and he runs the World Medical Response of the UN.
[37:14.000 --> 37:22.000]  And hey, maybe you feel powerless as just an average person, but you have to understand that they're rolling out this takeover system across the planet,
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  and if we don't oppose it, then we are literally like robots just taking orders from these people.
[37:26.000 --> 37:31.000]  So even though you don't feel empowered, even though you don't feel powerful, this is where you're talking to the average person,
[37:31.000 --> 37:39.000]  you need to understand that the only choice you have is either submit to this or say no to it and fight it, because that really is the two different destinies laying out before you.
[37:39.000 --> 37:48.000]  And I found just laying out the questions in a very hard, cut and dry way, cuts through against people to actually shift their paradigm and start the awakening process to come out of the trance.
[37:48.000 --> 37:57.000]  So many people will tell you, oh, just talk to folks very calmly and sweetly and try to bring up things very gently, but then they just go back to their trance.
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  A lot of folks will just agree with you, just agree with you, so you'll shut up.
[38:00.000 --> 38:06.000]  But if you tell them they're in grave danger and you explain they're about to have their freedoms totally taken, a lot of freedoms have already been taken,
[38:06.000 --> 38:18.000]  the electronic straightjacket and Iron Curtain is lowering down on us, then as they see tyranny unfold, they might actually decide to be involved and informed and to take control of their own will and say no to the system.
[38:18.000 --> 38:24.000]  I know you as this awesome audience of activists get that, but that's the message we've got to carry to everybody else.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  It's very, very serious.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  And right now, the credibility of those of us that have been exposing the new world order is very, very high.
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  That's what one of the maxims is, Alex Jones is right, or Alex Jones was right.
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  We were all right.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  There's another saying, Alex Jones is always right.
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  I don't think that that's accurate. I'm not always right.
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  I'm right about 98% of the time.
[38:42.000 --> 38:48.000]  But regardless, most of the time I'm wrong, it's when I say something and it's usually a lot worse than I actually said.
[38:48.000 --> 38:53.000]  So that's usually when I'm wrong and I wish I was wrong about how bad this whole thing is and how real it is.
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.000]  But the globalist are playing games, so I want to thank you all for your support.
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  We're all in this together.
[38:58.000 --> 39:04.000]  Thank you again to share the live link feeds, the articles, the videos, whatever you think is most important.
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.000]  And do that on a continual basis because people's minds are really ready for the truth right now.
[39:08.000 --> 39:14.000]  But you're that cold bucket of ice water that's going to get them out of the trance by just continuing to hammer the truth home.
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  Very, very fertile grounds out there in people's minds.
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  It's time to unlock people again and get them out of this satanic trance.
[39:21.000 --> 39:24.000]  Back to Owen Schroder and live feed.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[39:26.000 --> 39:35.000]  And I want to just explain something here before we get back to the news because, you know, we hear at Infowars,
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.000]  but I mean, we as the larger audience tuned in, we're all in this together.
[39:40.000 --> 39:54.000]  We have to be very focused, sometimes calm, sometimes berserker, but we have to be very focused and primed and ready for what comes next.
[39:54.000 --> 40:01.000]  And I mean, I'm just going to tell you, I think that it's only going to get much worse, quite frankly.
[40:01.000 --> 40:07.000]  And I think that we're going to see, you've already seen the one world government.
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  You've already seen the medical tyranny. You've witnessed that now. You're living it now.
[40:10.000 --> 40:16.000]  You're getting a taste of, I would say, late 1930s, early 1940s Nazi Germany.
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  You're getting a taste of that.
[40:18.000 --> 40:26.000]  You see, even the Nazis, what took three, four years to rise to power and then Hitler was in power for maybe four to five years.
[40:26.000 --> 40:37.000]  So, I mean, these things take time and this is a very complex, very complex, high technology tyranny that we are fighting now.
[40:37.000 --> 40:42.000]  So it's going to be worse than the Nazis, obviously, but, you know, we're seeing all this.
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  We don't understand how people can't see it. We don't understand how people can't wake up.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  This is just history repeating itself. That's how it always goes.
[40:49.000 --> 40:57.000]  You don't have a mass awakening and overturning of things until it's so bad that the veil of denial is evaporated.
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  And so you've now seen the global government medical tyranny.
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.000]  You're in it right now. You're experiencing it. It's only going to get worse.
[41:04.000 --> 41:10.000]  I do believe we are also going to see the climate tyranny.
[41:10.000 --> 41:15.000]  I think that that's where we're going to get to before this thing is really turned around by the people of planet Earth.
[41:15.000 --> 41:20.000]  If there's anybody left to turn it around.
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.000]  So we have to be expecting of this. We have to be ready for this.
[41:25.000 --> 41:29.000]  We can't panic as this thing only gets worse and worse and worse.
[41:29.000 --> 41:34.000]  We can sound the alarm. We can continue to inform people.
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  But it's going to get worse. We're going to get into the climate tyranny.
[41:36.000 --> 41:43.000]  I predict within four years because the criminals of this world government stealing everything from us are not going to be arrested.
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.000]  Nobody's going to hold them accountable. There's no obstacles. There's nothing in their way.
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  Nothing is stopping them. They're getting away with massive crimes.
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  Industrial level sex trafficking. No arrests.
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  Epstein. Oh, then he got whacked.
[41:58.000 --> 42:04.000]  Industrial level illegal immigration. Nothing. No one rests. Nothing.
[42:04.000 --> 42:11.000]  Industrial level biological warfare and research with with the Americans and the Chinese military.
[42:11.000 --> 42:19.000]  No arrests. No calls for anything. So all the resistance coming from the Republican Party or any leadership is just ceremonious.
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  It's not doing anything. So we're only going to get worse.
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  The medical tyranny is only going to get worse until people start getting arrested or held accountable for this.
[42:26.000 --> 42:35.000]  The making of the virus and then the releasing of the deadly vaccine.
[42:35.000 --> 42:43.000]  And you're going to get you're you are going to witness the climate tyranny. You are going to witness the social credit score, the climate tyranny.
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  It's only going to get worse. We're all going to witness it.
[42:46.000 --> 42:54.000]  So I'm kind of all firing on all cylinders, just turbocharged today, just dealing with all this.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  But we also have to understand that it's only going to get worse. And so we have to gird ourselves.
[42:59.000 --> 43:05.000]  The tyranny and oppression we're living under now has been way till they've got their world ID.
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.000]  And that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about.
[43:09.000 --> 43:14.000]  And Klaus Schwab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders own words.
[43:14.000 --> 43:22.000]  They admit that once they've got you with that system, then they're going to carbon tax you everywhere you go and track what you do.
[43:22.000 --> 43:31.000]  And publicly they're saying they're going to decide when you can travel and when you can't travel and mastercard and all the other big companies are currently announcing
[43:31.000 --> 43:36.000]  that they're going to track what you do and where you go and tax you with a carbon tax for it.
[43:36.000 --> 43:41.000]  This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen. This is the takeover in humanity.
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.000]  Better wake up and say no. Finally, folks are starting to wake up.
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.000]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others leave the charts along with them fours, but it's not enough.
[43:49.000 --> 43:54.000]  Every individual has to not comply. We have to talk about bringing the globalists to justice.
[43:54.000 --> 44:20.000]  You see, they need the fear of God putting them legally and lawfully.
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  And I think this is probably the most powerful one.
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  Survival Shield Extrude, nascent iodine.
[44:29.000 --> 44:34.000]  This is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet, have you haven't done the iodine challenge?
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  What are you waiting for now is the time.
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  Super male and super female vitality.
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  Living Defense Plus and the organic greens fiber caps.
[44:43.000 --> 44:48.000]  We have a limited supply of these right now, but we want to sell them all out so we can order a new batch.
[44:48.000 --> 44:49.000]  It was very popular.
[44:49.000 --> 44:56.000]  The organic green fiber caps, but we have all kinds of other great supplements that are great for so many different things.
[44:56.000 --> 44:58.000]  Take advantage of those.
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  I want to be very clear.
[45:02.000 --> 45:08.000]  The fact that Info Wars is having trouble funding itself is not the fault of our amazing listeners and supporters.
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  It is the fault of the globalists.
[45:10.000 --> 45:16.000]  When we can get enough of our great supplements, other products in, we're able to sell enough of it to stay on air
[45:16.000 --> 45:19.000]  and quite frankly even expand in the face of the new world order.
[45:19.000 --> 45:24.000]  But because of the supply chain breakdowns that were very easy to predict for the global lock downs,
[45:24.000 --> 45:25.000]  we're designed to do that.
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.000]  We have had real problems getting our best selling products in.
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  Some of them take up to 10 months to get in.
[45:30.000 --> 45:36.000]  We have to discontinue some of our products because we just can't get the ingredients anymore.
[45:36.000 --> 45:37.000]  It's pretty scary stuff.
[45:37.000 --> 45:41.000]  So please take advantage of sales we're running for one week only.
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.000]  There's only one week left from October 11th for seven days.
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  Kicks off October 11th on things like DNA Force Plus at 40% off,
[45:48.000 --> 45:52.000]  Winter Sun at 50% off, Ultra 12 at 50% off and more.
[45:52.000 --> 46:21.000]  At InfowarsStore.com, one week left, check out these incredible deals.
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  They're all loaded with the best natural ingredients to help not only improve your quality of sleep,
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[46:29.000 --> 46:33.000]  Many competitor sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep,
[46:33.000 --> 46:39.000]  but RocketRest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[46:39.000 --> 46:47.000]  It uses a unique quick release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  RocketRest helps you fall asleep fast, stay asleep and wake up feeling rested.
[46:51.000 --> 46:58.000]  So get the new RocketRest formula from Dr. Jones Naturals right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[47:22.000 --> 47:30.000]  Alright, I've been on air for almost an hour and I've barely even scratched the surface of all of this news.
[47:30.000 --> 47:33.000]  So I'm going to try to focus and do just that here in a second.
[47:33.000 --> 47:39.000]  But if I don't plug, we won't even be on air and I won't be able to cover any news.
[47:39.000 --> 47:44.000]  So it's important that we remind you of the specials at InfowarsStore.com.
[47:44.000 --> 47:50.000]  But before I do that, let me just show you the impact that even the smallest act of resistance
[47:50.000 --> 47:59.000]  or the smallest act of real world, I guess you could call it propaganda.
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  I mean propaganda can go both ways.
[48:01.000 --> 48:12.000]  So we'll say anti-propaganda propaganda of say posting a sticker that you get with your orders from InfowarsStore.com.
[48:12.000 --> 48:13.000]  We send you a bunch of stickers.
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  You never know how that can impact the world.
[48:15.000 --> 48:22.000]  Here's the example, a lady, Tracy Seful, I'm guessing is her name.
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  She's a big leftist liberal.
[48:24.000 --> 48:29.000]  She loves the mask and she recently went skydiving.
[48:29.000 --> 48:37.000]  Now, if you guys would indulge me here, if you can find the actual image of this,
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  because I really want the audience to see, no.
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  Okay, I'm being told she has removed this tweet.
[48:45.000 --> 48:50.000]  Yes, total victory.
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.000]  So, well, I still have the archive, so that's okay.
[48:53.000 --> 48:57.000]  There she is, big liberal brainwashed leftist, loves the mask, loves Fauci,
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.000]  would ultimately, her and her lineage would ultimately be enslaved
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  if the plan wasn't to call them off the planet.
[49:03.000 --> 49:04.000]  I feel bad for her.
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.000]  I'd love to see her alive and thriving with plenty of children and grandchildren and everything.
[49:09.000 --> 49:13.000]  That's the humanitarian thing, but she's brainwashed by the media.
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  She probably wouldn't want to hear from me.
[49:15.000 --> 49:20.000]  So, she goes skydiving and she realizes something.
[49:20.000 --> 49:28.000]  Guys, see if you can find an archive though, because I want this image in HD for the audience to see.
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  Here's the statement.
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  I literally put my life in this guy's hands and we all loved him,
[49:34.000 --> 49:40.000]  but I didn't read the writing on his helmet until you have got to be effing kidding me.
[49:40.000 --> 49:46.000]  So, ladies and gentlemen, her skydiving instructor here
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.000]  has a sticker on his helmet that says, arrest Fauci.
[49:51.000 --> 49:59.000]  And if you notice, it's our sticker from infowars.com.
[49:59.000 --> 50:05.000]  Now, the irony of this woman living in fear of COVID with a mask while going skydiving is,
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  I mean, that really puts the whole thing into perspective.
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.000]  Oh, I'm so afraid of the cold or the flu.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  I'm going to wear a mask everywhere or I'm that brainwashed,
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.000]  but then I'm going to hop out of a plane and go skydiving with a stranger.
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  I'm not talking trash on skydiving.
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  I'm just saying, you look at the, you weigh the two risks.
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  It's pretty funny.
[50:25.000 --> 50:30.000]  But so she finds out that there's an arrest Fauci info war sticker on his helmet
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.000]  and panics can't believe it.
[50:34.000 --> 50:40.000]  And then because the tweet goes so viral and has been such a promotional tool for info wars,
[50:40.000 --> 50:44.000]  she deletes the tweet.
[50:44.000 --> 50:49.000]  So, you never know how one act of resistance, how one act of bravery,
[50:49.000 --> 50:56.000]  how one act of anti propaganda action can change the world and influence others.
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.000]  So this guy skydiving instructor puts the little arrest Fauci sticker on his helmet
[51:00.000 --> 51:06.000]  and now that photo went so viral that the woman has had to erase the tweet.
[51:06.000 --> 51:16.720]  Yes, and I salute that skydiving instructor.
[51:16.720 --> 51:19.920]  We salute you, sir.
[51:19.920 --> 51:21.660]  That's how it's done right there.
[51:21.660 --> 51:26.400]  He just took a little sticker, put it on his helmet, and he just changed the world
[51:26.400 --> 51:29.840]  for some people, and he sent this little liberal into a tizzy fit.
[51:29.840 --> 51:30.840]  But hey, you know what?
[51:30.840 --> 51:31.840]  We love her.
[51:31.840 --> 51:32.840]  We care about her.
[51:32.840 --> 51:37.640]  We care be completely brainwashed by the propaganda, but that's okay.
[51:37.640 --> 51:41.480]  We'll continue to try to fight for her right to be free and fight for her right not to
[51:41.480 --> 51:45.760]  be part of a medical experiment and murdered by the world elite, even if she doesn't appreciate
[51:45.760 --> 51:46.760]  it.
[51:46.760 --> 51:49.280]  Yes, we found the HD.
[51:49.280 --> 51:50.280]  Yes.
[51:50.280 --> 51:51.280]  Yes.
[51:51.280 --> 51:56.680]  Hey, guys, can we tell the writers, somebody out there who's listening on the writers,
[51:56.680 --> 51:57.960]  guys, write up a story about this.
[51:57.960 --> 51:59.560]  It doesn't have to be a big thing.
[51:59.560 --> 52:04.320]  Just write a story about how, hey, skydiving instructor puts a rest fouchy sticker on his
[52:04.320 --> 52:08.120]  helmet and changes the world or something like that, and then highlight how she had
[52:08.120 --> 52:12.880]  to delete the tweet after it went massively viral and make sure they get that HD picture
[52:12.880 --> 52:13.880]  of it.
[52:13.880 --> 52:17.240]  Because this is the type of thing that can influence other people, folks.
[52:17.240 --> 52:18.240]  That's why this is so key.
[52:18.240 --> 52:20.480]  And that's why you say, oh, he just put a sticker on his helmet.
[52:20.480 --> 52:21.480]  It's just one tweet.
[52:21.480 --> 52:26.400]  No, millions of people saw that tweet, and now we're going to put it back up on infowars.com
[52:26.400 --> 52:28.280]  and millions more are going to see it.
[52:28.280 --> 52:33.840]  And then if a hundred or a thousand people are inspired by that to go do their own active
[52:33.840 --> 52:39.320]  resistance, to go be anti-propaganda agents in their own regard, we've just had a massive
[52:39.320 --> 52:40.320]  victory.
[52:40.320 --> 52:45.120]  And it all stems from one man and one sticker.
[52:45.120 --> 52:46.120]  That's the domino effect.
[52:46.120 --> 52:49.440]  So, guys, let's put up a story with that HD and just have a writer just write up a quick
[52:49.440 --> 52:54.000]  one and put it on infowars.com, or excuse me, infowars.com.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.480]  So this story can inspire others, and I believe it will.
[52:56.480 --> 53:04.120]  Now again, these stickers, we'll send a handful of these stickers with every order at infowarsstore.com.
[53:04.120 --> 53:05.920]  The crew is putting some of them on the screen.
[53:05.920 --> 53:10.520]  You can purchase them as well, but we will include, we always include a handful of them
[53:10.520 --> 53:11.520]  with every order.
[53:11.520 --> 53:18.640]  Now, here's what we have for sale or on sale at infowarsstore.com right now.
[53:18.640 --> 53:23.720]  DNA Force Plus, this is the flagship, this is the most elite supplement, maybe even on

[54:13.920 --> 54:19.280]  I keep hearing more reviews just organically from people saying, hey, I watched COVID land.
[54:19.280 --> 54:21.840]  Hey, my neighbor told me about COVID land.
[54:21.840 --> 54:23.400]  I'm going to have to watch it.
[54:23.400 --> 54:26.880]  Absolutely purchase the DVD at infowarsstore.com.

[54:37.480 --> 54:39.400]  information warfare.
[54:39.400 --> 54:41.200]  But I think that's hilarious.
[54:41.200 --> 54:46.200]  Tracy goes skydiving, and then she resents her skydiving instructor because he has an
[54:46.200 --> 54:51.880]  arrest Fauci infowars sticker on her helmet, which, you know, again, it's the throwing
[54:51.880 --> 55:02.240]  somebody a life jacket or throwing somebody an inner tube when they're gone overboard
[55:02.240 --> 55:06.600]  in the middle of the ocean and they're drowning, and then you throw them a live support and
[55:06.600 --> 55:09.320]  then they get up on deck and they hate you for it.
[55:09.320 --> 55:10.320]  But you know what?
[55:10.320 --> 55:12.360]  You did the right thing, so you don't feel bad about it.
[55:12.360 --> 55:15.800]  That's basically this woman's ideology and reality.
[55:15.800 --> 55:16.800]  But hey, you know what?
[55:16.800 --> 55:18.240]  We want Tracy to be free.
[55:18.240 --> 55:21.120]  We want her to be informed, even if she presents us for it.
[55:21.120 --> 55:23.600]  We don't want her to be a slave in the New World Order.
[55:23.600 --> 55:28.160]  So we'll continue to fight for your freedom and information, Tracy Seffel, even if you
[55:28.160 --> 55:29.560]  don't like it.
[55:29.560 --> 55:32.800]  But you deleted the tweet, but we still got the archive.
[55:32.800 --> 55:33.800]  Right there it is.
[55:33.800 --> 55:34.800]  I love it.
[55:34.800 --> 55:35.800]  Okay.
[55:35.800 --> 55:40.480]  Before I start to dig into more of this news, I want to just give an analogy here.
[55:40.480 --> 55:44.080]  And I've given it before, but I just continue to see it play itself out.
[55:44.080 --> 55:48.000]  And if you haven't seen the New Star Wars movie, you're just going to not understand
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.040]  it at all, but you may still understand the idea.
[55:51.040 --> 55:55.520]  So you have two characters in the New Star Wars films.
[55:55.520 --> 56:01.160]  One is, her name is Ray, and she comes from some forsaken planet, and she's basically
[56:01.160 --> 56:10.440]  just a peasant on this planet scrumming around for foods and scraps just to live on her own.
[56:10.440 --> 56:17.520]  And then you have another character who is part of the Imperial Army and is a storm trooper.
[56:17.520 --> 56:22.840]  And so they meet each other, and then they meet Han Solo.
[56:22.840 --> 56:27.520]  And so Ray, the young girl from the forsaken planet who's just, you know, scrummaging for
[56:27.520 --> 56:35.120]  scraps and supplies her whole life, she sees Han Solo and she doesn't understand.
[56:35.120 --> 56:39.800]  And Finn says, wait, you're Han Solo, you're the, you were part of the rebellion.
[56:39.800 --> 56:42.000]  You're a legendary pilot.
[56:42.000 --> 56:43.920]  This is the Millennium Falcon.
[56:43.920 --> 56:48.000]  And Han Solo is kind of like, yeah, you know, kid, whatever.
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.000]  And then Ray says, wait a second, I thought that was a myth.
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.280]  I thought that was a legend.
[56:53.280 --> 56:54.480]  That's not actually real.
[56:54.480 --> 56:55.640]  There's no Han Solo.
[56:55.640 --> 56:56.720]  There's no Millennium Falcon.
[56:56.720 --> 56:57.720]  There's no Force.
[56:57.720 --> 57:00.040]  There's no Luke Skywalker.
[57:00.040 --> 57:03.800]  But then Finn, the former storm trooper says, there is Luke Skywalker.
[57:03.800 --> 57:05.440]  There is Han Solo.
[57:05.440 --> 57:07.720]  There is the Force.
[57:07.720 --> 57:10.320]  And so here's what I'm trying to say.
[57:10.320 --> 57:14.160]  The average person out there is told, none of this is going on.
[57:14.160 --> 57:15.240]  There is no tyranny.
[57:15.240 --> 57:16.520]  There is no world government.
[57:16.520 --> 57:18.160]  Alex Jones is a liar.
[57:18.160 --> 57:19.600]  Don't believe any of that stuff.
[57:19.600 --> 57:21.600]  That, that's Ray.
[57:21.600 --> 57:26.320]  But see, notice how the storm trooper who's actually in the battle being told about all
[57:26.320 --> 57:28.540]  this knows it's all real.
[57:28.540 --> 57:30.160]  He knows Luke Skywalker is real.
[57:30.160 --> 57:31.360]  He knows Han Solo is real.
[57:31.360 --> 57:33.480]  He knows the Millennium Falcon is real.
[57:33.480 --> 57:37.720]  So the point is, folks, everything we're doing here is real.
[57:37.720 --> 57:42.600]  And anybody who's actually involved in this at high levels knows it's all real, knows
[57:42.600 --> 57:46.240]  Alex Jones is real, knows he's been right about everything, and they want to keep the
[57:46.240 --> 57:48.640]  general population dumb down and uninformed.
[57:48.640 --> 57:57.240]  Yeah, full wars, emergency supply chain breakdown sale is only running for one week from Monday,
[57:57.240 --> 58:00.640]  October 11th for seven days.
[58:00.640 --> 58:06.240]  That's because a bunch of these products that we have in stock are of limited supply because
[58:06.240 --> 58:11.840]  obviously the supply chain breakdown that I've been warning you of now for 20 months,
[58:11.840 --> 58:14.760]  because that's part of the great reset and part of the global's plan.
[58:14.760 --> 58:16.760]  That's what global lockdowns have been triggered.
[58:16.760 --> 58:19.080]  So we've not lowered the quality of any of our products.
[58:19.080 --> 58:23.880]  That means some of them have been sold out more than six months, like DNA Force Plus.
[58:23.880 --> 58:29.120]  It is 40% off, but coming up in one week, it will go back to full price, and we probably
[58:29.120 --> 58:33.000]  won't have more for up to six months, ladies and gentlemen.
[58:33.000 --> 58:36.600]  So it's a chance to support the broadcasts, get incredible products at the same time.
[58:36.600 --> 58:41.600]  Winter Sun, Ultra 12, they're both 50% off, they're going to go back to 10% off in a week
[58:41.600 --> 58:43.880]  as well, they're 50% off right now.

[58:47.640 --> 58:49.840]  healthier.
[58:49.840 --> 58:54.920]  A little more than 20 years ago, Japanese scientists discovered and were able to isolate
[58:54.920 --> 59:01.880]  a compound that is naturally in nature, and in foods we eat, but in very, very low amounts.
[59:01.880 --> 59:03.880]  It's called PQQ, or BiobQQ.
[59:03.880 --> 59:08.200]  When you have the organic form of it, it does amazing things.
[59:08.200 --> 59:12.960]  It actually makes your telomeres last longer, doesn't make them grow, but makes them last
[59:12.960 --> 59:13.960]  longer.
[59:13.960 --> 59:14.960]  This basically the same thing.
[59:14.960 --> 59:18.200]  So it's as close to the fountain of youth as you're going to get.
[59:18.200 --> 59:21.920]  Well, DNA Force Plus has been sold out for six months.
[59:21.920 --> 59:26.800]  It's back in stock, the highest quality, PQQ, CoQ10, and so much more.
[59:26.800 --> 59:31.960]  This entire formula is about cleaning out your cells and helping your body last longer,
[59:31.960 --> 59:34.360]  and that is so incredibly important.
[59:34.360 --> 59:40.240]  We have it at 40% off, despite the fact it's been sold out for six months, at infowarstore.com.
[59:40.240 --> 59:41.240]  It's amazing.
[59:41.240 --> 59:44.240]  If you haven't tried DNA Force Plus, you really should, and for those of you that love it,
[59:44.240 --> 59:52.800]  it's back in stock 40% off exclusively at infowarstore.com, DNA Force Plus.
[59:52.800 --> 59:59.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:59.080 --> 1:00:06.560]  All right, I'm fired up for freedom.
[1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:11.240]  I'm fired up to broadcast all this information out here today on the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:11.240 --> 1:00:12.560]  I'm going to get back into the news here.
[1:00:12.560 --> 1:00:16.200]  First, I want to play this clip, and I've got more clips highlighting this as well.
[1:00:16.200 --> 1:00:22.200]  This is the division being caused by the mainstream media right now over the COVID lies.
[1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:29.080]  So there was a walk your kid to school event, and naturally you had the non-vaccinated people
[1:00:29.080 --> 1:00:33.040]  and the vaccinated people and the kids in the masks and the kids not in the masks.
[1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:34.880]  So it's become a divisive thing.
[1:00:34.880 --> 1:00:41.400]  And here's what happened in a Los Angeles school at Walker Kid to School Day, basically
[1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:47.600]  the pro-vaccine people versus the not wanting to subject to an experimental vaccine people
[1:00:47.600 --> 1:00:49.040]  starting to strife.
[1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:50.040]  Here's the video.
[1:00:50.040 --> 1:00:57.160]  So it would appear to be several dozen angry people protesting vaccines and masks followed
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:00.920]  a large group of parents and children walking to school.
[1:01:00.920 --> 1:01:06.560]  This happened in Beverly Hills on National Walk and Bike to School Day, and this confrontation
[1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:13.560]  was caught on tape, watch.
[1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:19.200]  Pause it, I love this part.
[1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:21.080]  It's my choice if I want to mask my kid.
[1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:22.080]  It's my choice.
[1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:24.160]  But then they'll tell you it's not your choice to get a vaccine.
[1:01:24.160 --> 1:01:27.280]  Again, the pro-choice crowd is the most anti-choice crowd you're ever going to meet.
[1:01:27.280 --> 1:01:28.480]  I just wanted to highlight that.
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:31.560]  Again, these are parents saying, hey, you're torturing your kid with that mask and they
[1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:33.400]  say, but it's my choice to torture my kid.
[1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:36.920]  If I want to kill my kid or torture my kid, that's my choice.
[1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:37.920]  Here, go back.
[1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:40.920]  The children is child abuse.
[1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:42.920]  You mask your child, you're a child abuser.
[1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:46.920]  You should choose what goes on in your child's name and in your child's body.
[1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:47.920]  This is great.
[1:01:47.920 --> 1:01:48.920]  Yeah, this is great.
[1:01:48.920 --> 1:01:49.920]  They're trying to rape our children.
[1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:50.920]  It's amazing.
[1:01:50.920 --> 1:01:57.920]  And that was in front of the children.
[1:01:57.920 --> 1:01:58.920]  Oh, poor CNN.
[1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:04.240]  Last week, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that once the FDA grants full approval
[1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:08.280]  for all age groups, vaccines will be required in school.
[1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:09.640]  So imagine, all right, so that's pulled down.
[1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:13.120]  So imagine, though, you're the CNN host.
[1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:14.120]  And look, I get it.
[1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:15.320]  I don't like seeing this division.
[1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:17.360]  I don't like seeing that strife.
[1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:20.840]  And yeah, that's not exactly something you want to put kids through.
[1:02:20.840 --> 1:02:30.320]  But hey, isn't it worse to be forcefully injecting children with a experimental drug?
[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:33.280]  Isn't forced medication a lot worse?
[1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:39.560]  Isn't chemical rape a lot worse than an uncomfortable social situation?
[1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:42.400]  So hey, pick and choose your battles.
[1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:44.560]  CNN rapes the truth every day.
[1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:48.640]  CNN wants to chemically rape everybody with these experimental vaccines.
[1:02:48.640 --> 1:02:55.720]  So so virtue signaling CNN has zero ground to stand on.
[1:02:55.720 --> 1:03:03.480]  But the real point here is that this is the division being sowed in society right now.
[1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:06.200]  So what do you do again?
[1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:13.040]  I could selfishly say, hey, you know what, we should keep abortion legal because that
[1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:19.360]  way all the Satanists and all the anti-American liberals will kill their offspring and will
[1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:24.160]  inherit the planet will inherit the country because they'll all be dead and gone.
[1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:28.960]  So like as a strategic thing, you say, yeah, to your political opposition, you'd say, yeah,
[1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:29.960]  kill your babies.
[1:03:29.960 --> 1:03:30.960]  Absolutely.
[1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:34.880]  Kill your lineage, kill your gene line, kill them all.
[1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:37.880]  You would say that to your political opposition, but these people aren't really my political
[1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:38.880]  opposition.
[1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:39.880]  These are actually my brothers.
[1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:40.880]  These are my sisters.
[1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:41.880]  We're fellow Americans.
[1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:44.760]  We're fellow kids, plus those kids don't deserve that fate.
[1:03:44.760 --> 1:03:47.960]  But see, it's the same thing.
[1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:53.360]  It's the same concept where these parents show up to protect the children and say you shouldn't
[1:03:53.360 --> 1:03:54.360]  vaccinate your kids.
[1:03:54.360 --> 1:03:55.360]  It's killing people.
[1:03:55.360 --> 1:03:56.800]  It's causing heart problems.
[1:03:56.800 --> 1:03:58.520]  It's an experimental vaccine.
[1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:00.640]  You shouldn't be masking your children.
[1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:04.400]  It's causing all types of harm to them psychologically and physically.
[1:04:04.400 --> 1:04:06.920]  You're harming your kids.
[1:04:06.920 --> 1:04:09.800]  So that's just something you do because you care about the kids and you care about the
[1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:10.800]  truth.
[1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:14.680]  The resentment they get from the media, the resentment that they get from the other people
[1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:19.120]  out there, and then the irony of, it's my choice.
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:20.440]  It's my choice if I want to do this.
[1:04:20.440 --> 1:04:21.440]  It's my choice.
[1:04:21.440 --> 1:04:24.320]  But then they'll force you to take a vaccine.
[1:04:24.320 --> 1:04:25.720]  So they can't even see their own irony.
[1:04:25.720 --> 1:04:28.100]  They're blinded by hatred.
[1:04:28.100 --> 1:04:34.120]  And then Malcolm X quote here on the screen, only a fool would let his enemies teach his
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:36.200]  children.
[1:04:36.200 --> 1:04:37.840]  But they've already been suckered in.
[1:04:37.840 --> 1:04:39.600]  They've already been completely brainwashed.
[1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:40.960]  They can't recognize the enemy.
[1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:44.300]  They are one with the enemy now.
[1:04:44.300 --> 1:04:52.000]  But this is the real story here is this is the future of vaccinated people versus non-vaccinated
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:57.720]  people, striving all the time now because of the lies of the mainstream media and the
[1:04:57.720 --> 1:04:59.720]  brainwashing.
[1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:05.600]  So if you understand that this is not FDA approved, it's totally experimental.
[1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:09.240]  It's never been given to human beings before.
[1:05:09.240 --> 1:05:16.480]  Some of the ingredients inside of these shots have never been injected in human beings before.
[1:05:16.480 --> 1:05:18.840]  There are no long term studies.
[1:05:18.840 --> 1:05:23.280]  We don't know what's going to happen inside your body somewhere four to six weeks after
[1:05:23.280 --> 1:05:28.240]  your second injection or four to six months or even two years.
[1:05:28.240 --> 1:05:34.040]  We have no idea whether it's going to cause infertility, whether it's going to cause cancer,
[1:05:34.040 --> 1:05:37.120]  how bad your autoimmune disease is going to be.
[1:05:37.120 --> 1:05:40.800]  My conclusion after looking at this for a long time and listening to the arguments for
[1:05:40.800 --> 1:05:45.680]  these masks, I've determined that if you believe, if you're a medical doctor or a scientist
[1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:51.000]  that's spouting using these masks, you're either being played or you're being paid.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  Secure your copy of COVIDLand today at covidland.com.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:05.520]  If you order by October 6th, you get a free copy of Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:09.720]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:06:09.720 --> 1:06:18.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show and now your host, Owen Shroyer.
[1:06:18.040 --> 1:06:32.520]  All right, I want to read to you the entirety of a thread from Glubacco, Lettuva in Lithuania
[1:06:32.520 --> 1:06:38.320]  about life under the medical tyranny vaccine passport mandate.
[1:06:38.320 --> 1:06:41.960]  What it's like when you don't have the vaccine passport.
[1:06:41.960 --> 1:06:43.440]  So let me just get into this right now.
[1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:45.520]  By the way, this has gone totally viral.
[1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:51.360]  I just want to read the whole thing for you so that you can have a little better understanding
[1:06:51.360 --> 1:06:56.400]  of what this is like, at least in Lithuania and what our future will be like here if this
[1:06:56.400 --> 1:07:00.120]  is ever brought to America.
[1:07:00.120 --> 1:07:07.440]  So from Glubacco, Lettuva at Glubacco on Twitter with no covid pass.
[1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:10.640]  My wife and I are banished from society.
[1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:18.440]  We have no income banned from most shopping can barely exist, but we will not accept authoritarianism.
[1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:24.600]  Here's how life looks after one month in Lithuania under Europe's first strict society wide covid
[1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:27.520]  pass regime.
[1:07:27.520 --> 1:07:30.640]  My wife and I have been suspended without pay for four weeks.
[1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:33.000]  We can't return to our jobs.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.920]  Not sure our employers would let us back.
[1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:41.360]  Even if they did, our colleagues despise us, which on social media wish on social media
[1:07:41.360 --> 1:07:43.320]  for our death.
[1:07:43.320 --> 1:07:45.480]  Nothing we can do will ever erase that.
[1:07:45.480 --> 1:07:46.800]  We can't work there.
[1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:50.280]  How loving and tolerant.
[1:07:50.280 --> 1:07:52.960]  We can't find new jobs in our professions.
[1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:56.400]  My wife and I have very different jobs in very different fields.
[1:07:56.400 --> 1:08:01.240]  But all jobs in both our fields now require the covid vaccine pass.
[1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:02.240]  No pass.
[1:08:02.240 --> 1:08:03.400]  No job.
[1:08:03.400 --> 1:08:06.360]  We're not allowed to buy food in the local supermarket.
[1:08:06.360 --> 1:08:13.040]  We may only shop in small stores with street facing entrances, which mainly sell food,
[1:08:13.040 --> 1:08:18.480]  farm up glasses, context or farming and pet supplies in our area that effectively limits
[1:08:18.480 --> 1:08:23.120]  us to one small expensive convenience store.
[1:08:23.120 --> 1:08:26.280]  The pass has wreaked havoc with the free market.
[1:08:26.280 --> 1:08:31.360]  Shopper markets, which require the pass, report shopper traffic is down 25% in the month since
[1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:33.480]  the pass was imposed.
[1:08:33.480 --> 1:08:39.080]  But in the small stores where the pass isn't required, it's up only.7%.
[1:08:39.080 --> 1:08:41.600]  So where have the shoppers gone?
[1:08:41.600 --> 1:08:48.640]  We buy food in old Soviet style markets, outdoor and parking lots, products sold on streets,
[1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:55.080]  tiny tables or from the back of cars, produce eggs, cheese, meat, fish, cash only.
[1:08:55.080 --> 1:08:57.080]  No pass required.
[1:08:57.080 --> 1:09:00.680]  Not as convenient as a supermarket, but it works for now.
[1:09:00.680 --> 1:09:04.480]  Life finds a way.
[1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:06.680]  I need to make some home repairs.
[1:09:06.680 --> 1:09:10.760]  But without a pass, I can't enter the hardware store to buy supplies.
[1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:16.120]  I can't call for a repair worker because repairs are banned for non-pass holders.
[1:09:16.120 --> 1:09:22.520]  And I have no income now to pay for outside help anyway, so our home stays unrepaired.
[1:09:22.520 --> 1:09:28.680]  We went to the dentist we've attended for years for an appointment for one of my children,
[1:09:28.680 --> 1:09:32.280]  but had to leave because I don't have a COVID pass.
[1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:35.320]  No other dentist in our area will see us.
[1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:41.320]  We've heard of dentists who treat people with no pass, but they're far, so no dental care.
[1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:45.840]  We tried to buy art supplies for our kids from a craft store.
[1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:48.880]  No purchase allowed without a pass.
[1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:52.080]  We tried to buy educational toys in a toy store.
[1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:55.360]  We were barred from entering.
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:10:00.000]  Can't buy kitchen supplies, but now, but frustrating.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.080]  We tried to print some papers in a copy shop.
[1:10:03.080 --> 1:10:06.880]  The staff refused us service without a pass.
[1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:10.360]  We can't enter the library to browse books with our kids.
[1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:15.360]  That used to be one of our family's greatest pleasures, but we're not allowed anymore because
[1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:17.720]  we don't have a pass.
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:21.600]  Our two kids outgrew and destroyed last winter's clothes.
[1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:26.480]  We tried to buy new ones, but with no pass, many stores rejected us.
[1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:32.080]  Finally, my pregnant wife begging tears in her eyes, a manager at a secondhand store
[1:10:32.080 --> 1:10:35.120]  relented just this once, okay?
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:38.720]  Can't let you people in here again.
[1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:41.120]  This pressure to submit is everywhere.
[1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:42.120]  It's overwhelming.
[1:10:42.120 --> 1:10:46.440]  Our ability to survive has been destroyed, but no matter the suffering imposed and the
[1:10:46.440 --> 1:10:51.440]  hardships we must endure, we must never accept the descent into the authoritarianism
[1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:55.040]  which the COVID pass represents.
[1:10:55.040 --> 1:11:01.960]  QR pass, code to enter stores, COVID pass needed to work, government approval needed
[1:11:01.960 --> 1:11:06.160]  to buy food, toys, clothes, no, no, no.
[1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:10.840]  The COVID pass regime of government segregation and control punishing undesired behavior with
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:15.480]  banishment from society is the path to authoritarianism.
[1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:19.080]  When COVID vaccinations were released, the original policy was education, trust, and
[1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:21.760]  informed consent to vaccinate targeted groups.
[1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:27.320]  But policy changed in 2021, choice and trust was replaced by coercion and punishment.
[1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:33.240]  You've shredded trust in public health for generations.
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:37.960]  So there is the entirety of that thread, a taste of what it's like to live under medical
[1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:40.360]  tyranny which will go worldwide.
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:44.200]  Now, here's the struggle.
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:51.760]  And they assume the globalists, the tyrants, the authoritarians like Fauci and Gates and
[1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:55.000]  Schwab and the list goes on.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:59.240]  They assume you're too weak to endure this battle.
[1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:03.680]  They assume you're too weak and you're too brainwashed and you're too lazy that you will
[1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:05.880]  submit to them.
[1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:10.200]  And that's why this couple's struggle is so important.
[1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:18.720]  So what it comes down to is this, it's going to be extremely uncomfortable for a number
[1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:23.720]  of years living under this authoritarian world regime.
[1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:26.480]  And here in Texas, it's not so bad.
[1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:29.320]  And in other places, it's not so bad, but they're not going to relent.
[1:12:29.320 --> 1:12:32.000]  They're going to keep pressuring and they're going to get what they want because there
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:36.680]  is really hardly any resistance, especially not from leadership.
[1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:42.960]  And any of the resistance coming from leadership is mostly just ceremonial.
[1:12:42.960 --> 1:12:44.240]  But we must resist.
[1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:46.840]  We must not give in to the authoritarianism.
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:53.500]  We must stand for freedom of choice when it comes to, especially, medical experimentation
[1:12:53.500 --> 1:12:55.680]  with these drugs.
[1:12:55.680 --> 1:12:59.800]  And we must just stand for freedom in the free market overall because the assumption from
[1:12:59.800 --> 1:13:03.480]  the New World or globalists is you will submit this time, you'll submit the next time, you'll
[1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:06.840]  submit the third time, and then all there is is submission.
[1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:07.840]  There is nothing else.
[1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:09.920]  There is no even choice to resist.
[1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:13.160]  And if they can cross a threshold of enough people, well, then it's over.
[1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:15.240]  The New World Order global government is here.
[1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:17.600]  The free market dies forever on planet Earth.
[1:13:17.600 --> 1:13:22.280]  No more freedom, no more prosperity, no more upward mobility.
[1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:27.840]  Just total oppression and degradation.
[1:13:27.840 --> 1:13:33.440]  And guys, I don't even want to see the replies to this story because it's just so sick.
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:37.680]  And I just can't handle it right now because it makes my stomach churn.
[1:13:37.680 --> 1:13:40.520]  Because we're fighting for these people, and they hate us for it.
[1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:44.480]  This Lithuanian couple is fighting for all the people under the medical tyranny, under
[1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:47.760]  the authoritarian regime, and they're resented for it.
[1:13:47.760 --> 1:13:50.800]  But they're true heroes for doing what's right.
[1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:59.240]  And I mean, look, I live in Austin, Texas, which is still in Texas, so we're still okay.
[1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:09.240]  But I have a natural instinct, call it a survival instinct, call it just common sense, to just
[1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:15.600]  get as far away from any Democrat, just as far away as I can.
[1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:22.800]  And I understand for someone like me that enjoys life, I like going out and eating at
[1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:27.400]  restaurants and steak dinners, and I like going golfing and I like going to concerts
[1:14:27.400 --> 1:14:28.880]  and I like going to ball games.
[1:14:28.880 --> 1:14:31.080]  I enjoy all that stuff.
[1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:35.480]  But see, the assumption that the new ruler makes is that I will sacrifice my body.
[1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:41.480]  I will sacrifice my freedom, my free will, and everything that my ancestors have fought
[1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:47.920]  for, literally, that I would sacrifice all of that just for the simple pleasures of life
[1:14:47.920 --> 1:14:50.640]  that they're going to hold hostage and take away from me.
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:52.840]  I won't sacrifice it.
[1:14:52.840 --> 1:14:55.100]  I will not.
[1:14:55.100 --> 1:14:58.280]  And neither should you.
[1:14:58.280 --> 1:15:03.600]  So we're going to have to hold this line for a while, maybe a couple years.
[1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:04.600]  And you know what?
[1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:05.600]  It's not going to be fun.
[1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:07.120]  It's going to be torturous.
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:10.200]  And it's going to be the old saying, if you never know what you got till it's gone, we're
[1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:12.240]  going to realize how great we had it in this country.
[1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:19.000]  The ease of access, the abundance, the cheap energy, all of it, it's all going away.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.560]  So yeah, you're going to have to look for new markets that aren't going to take the
[1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:22.560]  vaccine pass.
[1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:25.000]  You're going to look for new ways of entertaining yourself.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:29.040]  You may just have to move entirely to different parts of the country to get away from this
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:33.600]  stuff, because that's my instinct is I need to be as far away from Democrat leadership
[1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:34.600]  as possible.
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:40.080]  I need to be as far away from the brainwashed minions of the New World Order that are vaccinating
[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:42.200]  themselves to death as possible.
[1:15:42.200 --> 1:15:44.120]  I'm not saying I'm going anywhere.
[1:15:44.120 --> 1:15:45.560]  I'm just saying that's the instinct.
[1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:50.720]  So there's going to be some tough times ahead, but we have to hold the line and we have to
[1:15:50.720 --> 1:15:56.200]  understand everything that's at stake, and it's much more important to maintain freedom
[1:15:56.200 --> 1:15:59.080]  than to enjoy a ballgame or a bar or a restaurant.
[1:15:59.080 --> 1:16:03.160]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace
[1:16:03.160 --> 1:16:05.320]  and not spend thousands doing it?
[1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:08.240]  You can with Great Wall of Fire fireplace grates.

[1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:18.120]  we've got.

[1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:05.640]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience.
[1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:07.840]  A symbol of slavery.
[1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:14.160]  A symbol of the chains that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations
[1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:15.160]  has put in place.
[1:18:15.160 --> 1:18:21.040]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[1:18:21.040 --> 1:18:26.440]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[1:18:26.440 --> 1:18:29.240]  faces from the light of the sun.
[1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:37.480]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:41.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[1:18:41.920 --> 1:18:45.120]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[1:18:45.120 --> 1:18:48.840]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[1:18:48.840 --> 1:18:51.680]  the World ID and Carbon Taxes.
[1:18:51.680 --> 1:18:53.840]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[1:18:53.840 --> 1:18:57.240]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[1:18:57.240 --> 1:18:59.880]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[1:18:59.880 --> 1:19:05.520]  You'd have to be hiding under a rock not to know that vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc and
[1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:10.040]  other essential vitamins and minerals are essential to our bodies, to our immune systems.
[1:19:10.040 --> 1:19:12.080]  We don't have them long term.
[1:19:12.080 --> 1:19:13.080]  We die.
[1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:17.160]  But what a lot of people don't know is even if you have those compounds, the levels that
[1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:23.360]  are recommended, if you don't have deep restful, clean sleep, your body will fall apart even
[1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:24.360]  faster.
[1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:28.200]  And with so many chemicals in the food and water and so much agitation in the culture
[1:19:28.200 --> 1:19:30.240]  and life, it's hard to settle down.
[1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:31.240]  It's hard to relax.
[1:19:31.240 --> 1:19:32.680]  Well, let me tell you something right now.
[1:19:32.680 --> 1:19:35.760]  Down and out is an incredibly strong natural compound.
[1:19:35.760 --> 1:19:40.360]  It's got over eight compounds in it that will give you deep, pure, clean sleep.
[1:19:40.360 --> 1:19:41.800]  And it's such a game changer.
[1:19:41.800 --> 1:19:46.080]  So with all the vitamins and minerals, the last big ingredient is down and out available
[1:19:46.080 --> 1:19:50.080]  again at m4warstore.com for 50% off.
[1:19:50.080 --> 1:19:51.080]  And you know what?
[1:19:51.080 --> 1:19:54.080]  I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out, even though we've already sold out a
[1:19:54.080 --> 1:20:02.360]  half of it in just the last month and we probably are going to have more for about five months.
[1:20:02.360 --> 1:20:20.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:20.480 --> 1:20:28.360]  We have a whistleblower, a hospital whistleblower coming up in studio in the next hour.
[1:20:28.360 --> 1:20:31.240]  You're not going to want to miss that.
[1:20:31.240 --> 1:20:34.880]  But I got a bunch more video clips and news coming up as well.
[1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:35.880]  So let me just do this.
[1:20:35.880 --> 1:20:39.280]  Let me, let me try to, there's no way I can even do it in this segment, but I'm going
[1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:45.880]  to try my best to get through the rest of this COVID and vaccine news, just to put it
[1:20:45.880 --> 1:20:48.120]  all into perspective and what we're dealing with.
[1:20:48.120 --> 1:20:50.680]  And you know, this kind of puts it into perspective and I actually looked this up.
[1:20:50.680 --> 1:20:54.800]  I couldn't even believe this and I'm not trying to be gross here, but it just kind of puts
[1:20:54.800 --> 1:20:56.480]  thing into perspective here.
[1:20:56.480 --> 1:21:03.160]  Did you know that diarrhea kills 1.8 million people a year?
[1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:04.480]  Did you know that?
[1:21:04.480 --> 1:21:05.480]  That's actually real.
[1:21:05.480 --> 1:21:09.480]  I went and I looked it up 1.8 million people a year.
[1:21:09.480 --> 1:21:10.480]  Where's the folks?
[1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:14.340]  We have a, we have a diarrhea pandemic.
[1:21:14.340 --> 1:21:19.560]  We have a diarrhea pandemic in this country.
[1:21:19.560 --> 1:21:24.720]  Give me a vaccine, give me healthcare treatment, shut down the toilets, my God.
[1:21:24.720 --> 1:21:26.600]  It's a diarrhea pandemic.
[1:21:26.600 --> 1:21:30.280]  Of course that's ridiculous.
[1:21:30.280 --> 1:21:32.080]  But should we be locking the country down?
[1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:33.120]  Should we be doing panic?
[1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:37.520]  Should we be doing, be doing all the fear mongering 1.8 million from diarrhea a year?
[1:21:37.520 --> 1:21:39.240]  What is wrong with our diets?
[1:21:39.240 --> 1:21:41.520]  Should we be mandating healthier diets?
[1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:50.320]  No, that's insanity, but we do for COVID because that's a global conquering operation.
[1:21:50.320 --> 1:21:56.120]  Here's Mayor Adler, our despicable corrupt mayor, Austin is going to complete hell in
[1:21:56.120 --> 1:22:02.760]  a handbasket and he painted a sidewalk the gay flag today because he's a virtue signaler.
[1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:05.200]  But he says, get your flu shot.
[1:22:05.200 --> 1:22:06.200]  He never stops.
[1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:10.960]  Get your vaccines, get your vaccines, get your flu shots, get your COVID vaccines.
[1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:13.000]  I guess Big Pharma pays him well.
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:16.160]  By the way, you know, the flu disappeared last year.
[1:22:16.160 --> 1:22:19.640]  Just gone, totally gone because there was no more flu.
[1:22:19.640 --> 1:22:22.720]  They rebranded it and called it COVID.
[1:22:22.720 --> 1:22:23.720]  Moving on.
[1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:29.520]  Italians fight back against violent police while protesting vaccine mandates.
[1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:31.520]  I've got more footage of that going on.
[1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:35.680]  In fact, guys, just roll B roll of clip three for me, please.
[1:22:35.680 --> 1:22:44.120]  Just some of the scene in Rome, I guess it was over the weekend.
[1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:51.480]  And they say in Italy as of October 15th, the vaccine pass is going to be mandated.
[1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:57.760]  So I guess life in Italy will be like life in Lithuania from that couple that I just
[1:22:57.760 --> 1:22:59.760]  read about.
[1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:09.480]  Everybody said Lord Fauci, God Fauci, the dictator Fauci, he's the Jim Jones, the leader
[1:23:09.480 --> 1:23:14.720]  of the cult, Fauci grants permission for kids to go trick or treating.
[1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:19.120]  Oh, well, nobody asked you a whole.
[1:23:19.120 --> 1:23:21.200]  Nobody asked you if we can celebrate Christmas.
[1:23:21.200 --> 1:23:23.240]  Nobody asked you if we can celebrate Thanksgiving.
[1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:24.960]  Nobody asked you if we can go trick or treating.
[1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:28.040]  Why don't you just buzz off?
[1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:30.320]  Go make another virus that kills millions of people.
[1:23:30.320 --> 1:23:31.320]  Why don't you?
[1:23:31.320 --> 1:23:33.120]  I think Fauci should just stick to that.
[1:23:33.120 --> 1:23:36.000]  Hey, Fauci, do me a favor, do us all a favor.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  Why don't you go back to making and funding research of gain and function and spillover
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:42.880]  viruses that you're good at?
[1:23:42.880 --> 1:23:46.800]  That seems to be the only thing you're good at is killing people with manmade viruses,
[1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:47.800]  Fauci.
[1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:51.520]  So why don't you quit telling us how to live our lives and get back to funding research
[1:23:51.520 --> 1:23:55.640]  of deadly viruses that get released on the planet, remake the planet and kill millions
[1:23:55.640 --> 1:23:56.640]  of people?
[1:23:56.640 --> 1:23:57.840]  That's what you're good at, Fauci.
[1:23:57.840 --> 1:24:00.640]  We don't want to take your advice on how to live our life.
[1:24:00.640 --> 1:24:06.080]  So go back to funding deadly viral research in China, go back to colluding with the Chinese
[1:24:06.080 --> 1:24:10.520]  Communist military, and just leave us alone, would you?
[1:24:10.520 --> 1:24:14.600]  Go back to helping make deadly viruses that kill millions of people, Fauci.
[1:24:14.600 --> 1:24:18.720]  We don't want to hear you telling us what to do anymore.
[1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:21.920]  We'll have more on that upcoming.
[1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:27.040]  Media now claims that double vaccinated Brits who have bad colds are actually suffering
[1:24:27.040 --> 1:24:28.040]  from COVID.
[1:24:28.040 --> 1:24:32.320]  Oh, oh, you mean the vaccine is making you sick?
[1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:38.640]  Just like info wars said, it's not that we're that smart, it's just we can, hey, look, there's
[1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:39.640]  a sunrise.
[1:24:39.640 --> 1:24:40.640]  Hey, look, there's a sunset.
[1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:42.840]  Hey, look, that's a tree.
[1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:45.320]  Just obvious stuff, just pointing out the obvious.
[1:24:45.320 --> 1:24:49.160]  Nobody else wants to do it because it's so devastating is what it is.
[1:24:49.160 --> 1:24:52.920]  It's so devastating to think this virus was made in a lab and released intentionally.
[1:24:52.920 --> 1:24:56.280]  It's so devastating to think that the vaccines are actually killing people.
[1:24:56.280 --> 1:24:57.280]  But that's the reality.
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:02.600]  It's kind of like getting it's like your best friend or your dad or something just died
[1:25:02.600 --> 1:25:03.600]  in a car accident.
[1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:04.600]  That's devastating.
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:05.600]  That sucks.
[1:25:05.600 --> 1:25:06.600]  That's the worst thing.
[1:25:06.600 --> 1:25:08.080]  But that's the reality.
[1:25:08.080 --> 1:25:11.840]  Yeah, the vaccines are making people sick.
[1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:14.680]  And so finally, people are realizing it.
[1:25:14.680 --> 1:25:16.720]  I don't care if people want to listen to info wars or not.
[1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:19.360]  I just want people to be informed.
[1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:22.280]  But finally, people are starting to realize it, whether they admit info wars is right
[1:25:22.280 --> 1:25:28.520]  or not as irrelevant, a quarter of football league, that's the international soccer league.
[1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:33.600]  Probably the best one is in England or you could say maybe you could argue Italy or Spanish
[1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:38.200]  league, but a quarter of football league players say they won't get vaccinated.
[1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:42.240]  Well, yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it's undeniable now.
[1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:45.960]  There's so much information about the vaccinated dying and getting sick.
[1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:47.480]  They can't cover it up.
[1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:50.840]  So yeah, of course, people aren't going to get vaccinated and see now people understand
[1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:52.560]  what's at stake.
[1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:57.920]  They understand giving into this tyranny means you're no longer free for the rest of your
[1:25:57.920 --> 1:26:01.920]  time on planet Earth, or you could just die overnight.
[1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:04.400]  Anytime you could just be dead from the vaccine.
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:09.000]  So people realize what's at stake now and they're not going along with it anymore.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  But that's why they need so much tyranny to hold you hostage to make you go along with
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  it.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:17.960]  Some Ontario towns won't let couples get a marriage license without a vaccine passport.
[1:26:17.960 --> 1:26:25.200]  Good job, Canada, way to go into complete tyranny, Johns Hopkins data proves COVID shots causing
[1:26:25.200 --> 1:26:28.520]  majority of illness and death stories at info wars.com.
[1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:29.600]  It's pretty shocking.
[1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:33.680]  It's pretty unbelievable again, not to be redundant.
[1:26:33.680 --> 1:26:35.880]  I don't care who wants to put the information out there.
[1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:41.160]  I don't care who wants to get credit, but we reported all of this first.
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:43.320]  The vaccines are killing people.
[1:26:43.320 --> 1:26:46.840]  Hell, I put up a video guys, what did we title that video?
[1:26:46.840 --> 1:26:52.560]  I covered it last week on the war room where an individual just goes to the international
[1:26:52.560 --> 1:26:59.440]  vaccine injury database and pulls up the number of the hundreds and thousands of deaths from
[1:26:59.440 --> 1:27:00.560]  vaccines.
[1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:02.240]  That's the international database.
[1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:04.120]  Then you can go to the US database.
[1:27:04.120 --> 1:27:10.440]  That's the VAERS website and there are 17,000 people have died from the COVID vaccine this
[1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:11.440]  year.
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:12.440]  17,000.
[1:27:12.440 --> 1:27:14.600]  You say, hey, well, you know, that's kind of a low number.
[1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:15.600]  Who cares?
[1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:17.400]  A bunch of people have been vaccinated, 17,000.
[1:27:17.400 --> 1:27:18.400]  That's a low number.
[1:27:18.400 --> 1:27:19.400]  I don't care.
[1:27:19.400 --> 1:27:20.400]  Oh, really?
[1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:23.480]  You want to play Russian roulette?
[1:27:23.480 --> 1:27:26.200]  You want to mandate Russian roulette with your body?
[1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:28.440]  Hey, let's play Russian roulette.
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:30.080]  I've got a revolver here.
[1:27:30.080 --> 1:27:33.720]  There's one bullet and there's 10,000 chambers.
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:38.200]  So just pull the trigger and yeah, you probably won't blow your brains out, but you have to
[1:27:38.200 --> 1:27:41.920]  pull the trigger, put the gun to your temple and pull the trigger.
[1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:45.720]  And yeah, the odds are that you're not going to blow your brains out with when you pull
[1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:49.080]  that trigger, but somebody's going to hope it's not you.
[1:27:49.080 --> 1:27:50.080]  Good luck.
[1:27:50.080 --> 1:27:51.080]  We're mandating Russian roulette now.
[1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:53.680]  But yeah, there it is.
[1:27:53.680 --> 1:27:57.080]  This vaccine, death data will shock and horrify you.
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:27:59.600]  The video is on the War Room channel and banned out video.
[1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:04.240]  And again, it's just the guy, because I can show you it, but there's different flavors.
[1:28:04.240 --> 1:28:10.200]  There's different presentations and this is just a powerful presentation, no commentary.
[1:28:10.200 --> 1:28:15.400]  There's the guy scrolling through all the vaccine database, the adverse effect database,
[1:28:15.400 --> 1:28:21.160]  so you can see the tens of thousands of dead from the COVID vaccines from official government
[1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:22.160]  data.
[1:28:22.160 --> 1:28:24.400]  But hey, let's mandate Russian roulette while we're at it.
[1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:25.400]  Only some will die.
[1:28:25.400 --> 1:28:26.400]  Not all.
[1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:28.240]  It's for the good of the people.
[1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:32.280]  And people, again, either they're starting to see all the information about the deadly
[1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:36.920]  vaccines or they're experiencing it firsthand, like Colonel Allen West.
[1:28:36.920 --> 1:28:41.160]  Through this experience, I am even more dedicated to fighting against vaccine mandates.
[1:28:41.160 --> 1:28:43.240]  Colonel Allen West and his wife come down with COVID.
[1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:45.120]  Allen West was not vaccinated.
[1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:46.320]  His wife was.
[1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:48.920]  His wife had an awful spout with COVID.
[1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:50.120]  His vaccinated wife.
[1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:51.400]  He didn't get it at first.
[1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:53.480]  His wife did and then spread to him.
[1:28:53.480 --> 1:28:54.920]  It's the vaccine variant.
[1:28:54.920 --> 1:28:56.640]  It's all by design.
[1:28:56.640 --> 1:28:59.080]  Just ask Anthony Fauci, but he'd lie about it anyway.
[1:28:59.080 --> 1:29:07.040]  If you're concerned about the coming chaos, this will be an extremely important message.
[1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:08.040]  Here's why.
[1:29:08.040 --> 1:29:14.800]  No matter what the outcome in November, catastrophic social upheaval is a very real possibility.
[1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:16.160]  Here's why this is important.
[1:29:16.160 --> 1:29:20.920]  Listen, we all know that silver and gold have been historic hedges against the uncertain
[1:29:20.920 --> 1:29:24.720]  waves of social chaos and unstable currencies.
[1:29:24.720 --> 1:29:29.560]  Did you know that there's been times in the past during times of extreme hardship when
[1:29:29.560 --> 1:29:33.840]  Americans put another store of value above even silver and gold?
[1:29:33.840 --> 1:29:34.840]  It's true.
[1:29:34.840 --> 1:29:39.560]  Open pollinated seeds have been and could very well be the ultimate store of value in
[1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:41.280]  the coming hard times ahead.
[1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:45.400]  Go to survivalseedbank.com to get heirloom seeds below wholesale.

[1:29:59.600 --> 1:30:04.680]  A little more than 20 years ago, Japanese scientists discovered and were able to isolate
[1:30:04.680 --> 1:30:11.600]  a compound that is naturally in nature and in foods we eat, but in very, very low amounts.
[1:30:11.600 --> 1:30:13.720]  It's called PQQ or BiobQQ.
[1:30:13.720 --> 1:30:17.960]  When you have the organic form of it, it does amazing things.
[1:30:17.960 --> 1:30:22.720]  It actually makes your telomeres last longer, doesn't make them grow, but makes them last
[1:30:22.720 --> 1:30:24.680]  longer in the space of the same thing.
[1:30:24.680 --> 1:30:27.880]  So it's as close to the fountain of youth as you're going to get.
[1:30:27.880 --> 1:30:31.680]  Well, DNA Force Plus has been sold out for six months.
[1:30:31.680 --> 1:30:36.520]  It's back in stock, the highest quality, PQQ, CoQ10 and so much more.

[1:30:41.480 --> 1:30:44.080]  and that is so incredibly important.

[1:30:53.520 --> 1:30:59.760]  it, it's back in stock 40% off exclusively at infowarstore.com, DNA Force Plus.
[1:30:59.760 --> 1:31:03.160]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:31:03.160 --> 1:31:07.400]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:31:07.400 --> 1:31:10.600]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[1:31:10.600 --> 1:31:13.680]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[1:31:13.680 --> 1:31:15.000]  can to shut us down.
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:19.320]  So please pray to keep Info Wars on the air and please support the local station you're
[1:31:19.320 --> 1:31:20.320]  listening to as well.
[1:31:20.320 --> 1:31:26.400]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[1:31:26.400 --> 1:31:31.320]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[1:31:31.320 --> 1:31:32.800]  in the face of this thing.
[1:31:32.800 --> 1:31:34.920]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:31:34.920 --> 1:31:39.240]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:31:39.240 --> 1:31:44.240]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy

[1:32:30.280 --> 1:32:31.700]  to get in.
[1:32:31.700 --> 1:32:36.280]  We've had to discontinue some of our products because we just can't get the ingredients
[1:32:36.280 --> 1:32:37.280]  anymore.

[1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:56.440]  end of the Jones show and then I've got another stack of news I've already got planned to
[1:33:56.440 --> 1:34:04.960]  cover on the war room today including sadly people inside of our military selling secrets
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:13.400]  to China and it also is now totally proven that they were leftist activists in the Navy
[1:34:13.400 --> 1:34:19.920]  selling military secrets to China oh go figure more more more anti-American leftist committing
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:23.920]  treason who would have thought so you may not hear much about that today but I'm going
[1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:27.280]  to be covering that coming up in the war room let me try to get through the rest of this
[1:34:27.280 --> 1:34:31.520]  COVID news takes hours to get through all of it and so I don't mean to be redundant but
[1:34:31.520 --> 1:34:34.560]  this is really the most important thing because this is where the global tyranny is going
[1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:43.400]  to come from so back at it reports uncovered show COVID-19 was a planned bio weapon of
[1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:48.200]  China's people's liberation army and if we don't have enough evidence of this now the
[1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:52.280]  Gateway Pundit has just received exclusive documents that they've published here with
[1:34:52.280 --> 1:34:59.040]  this story that highlight all of it and how actually they started the planning of this
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:06.520]  more than a decade ago and so my guess is that our government knew about this as well
[1:35:06.520 --> 1:35:13.600]  and that's why we sent them the bio weapons research or that's why we sent them the gain
[1:35:13.600 --> 1:35:20.560]  of function spill over research from the North Carolina lab on bat viruses to the Chinese
[1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:26.720]  military research facilities in Wuhan in Wuhan and other areas Fauci knew all about it so
[1:35:26.720 --> 1:35:33.720]  it was this collusion over the course of decades to release this virus certainly appears to
[1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:42.280]  be the case with all the fallout and aftermath being so well coordinated fact check Dr. Fauci's
[1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:46.280]  claim that the highly effective and safe vaccine prevents individuals from getting infected
[1:35:46.280 --> 1:35:53.720]  with COVID is false yes and of course we all already knew that but now they're admitting
[1:35:53.720 --> 1:36:00.560]  that the unvaccinated it's actually the vaccinated now that cause a threat to the unvaccinated
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:06.840]  because they're creating the vaccine variants known as Delta or Mu or Lambda or whatever
[1:36:06.840 --> 1:36:13.760]  Greek term that they use it's all the vaccine variants that's why and they'll never explain
[1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:17.720]  this logically because they would just admit everything they said is a lie why are you
[1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:23.280]  seeing more COVID death in the year 2021 than in the year 2020 because of the vaccines why
[1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:28.760]  are you seeing more COVID cases in the year 2021 than in the year 2020 because of the
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:33.880]  vaccines if the vaccines were working those numbers would be down why are they up because
[1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:41.200]  the vaccines are causing people to get sick and die like this Denver police officer who
[1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:47.160]  reluctantly took the jab then lost his ability to walk and has now been hospitalized with
[1:36:47.160 --> 1:36:56.720]  a stroke yes but play Russian roulette with these vaccines we love you so much an epidemic
[1:36:56.720 --> 1:37:02.920]  of the vaccinated latest UK data shows rate of infection among vaxxed exceeds unvaxxed
[1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:10.640]  in every age group over 30 and the only reason why it's not like that under 30 is because
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:16.440]  in the UK they quit vaccinating people under 30 because they're all the bad side effects
[1:37:16.440 --> 1:37:19.800]  so you don't have as many people that are vaccinated under 30 as you do above 30 but
[1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:25.280]  that's why all the people above 30 that have been vaccinated are getting sick so the COVID
[1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:32.560]  vaccine gets you sick then it destroys your immune system so you stay sick meanwhile if
[1:37:32.560 --> 1:37:37.720]  you're unvaccinated or non-vaccinated really is the proper term if you're non-vaccinated
[1:37:37.720 --> 1:37:44.040]  like myself you're perfectly healthy and you have a strong immune system I was sick I was
[1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:48.520]  sick once this year for a couple days and then it took me a couple days to recover that
[1:37:48.520 --> 1:37:53.760]  was it for me I'm back healthy as a horse baby no vaccine for me I didn't even go to
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:59.400]  a doctor I didn't take ivermectin nothing and then I had a person staying with me who
[1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:04.600]  came into town and then got sick while was in town ended up having to stay with me for
[1:38:04.600 --> 1:38:08.960]  a week because was sick tested positive for COVID in my house for a week we had dinner
[1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:15.000]  together everything never got sick never got COVID I guess natural immunity works huh how
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:24.040]  did I survive that I guess natural immunity works amazing amazing customs officials see
[1:38:24.040 --> 1:38:29.480]  these small packages of life-saving ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in Chicago while record
[1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:33.520]  amounts of fentanyl continue to flow across southern border so yeah you try to send ivermectin
[1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:38.640]  to a friend or family member dying from COVID to try to get them healthy or hydroxychloroquine
[1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:42.720]  it's seized by customs but you send fentanyl or all these other drugs they won't seize
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:46.920]  that they'll let that kill you but oh you want to save somebody's life with ivermectin
[1:38:46.920 --> 1:38:49.880]  or hydroxychloroquine or Regeneron or any of that stuff and so you send it through the
[1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:56.640]  mail the Democrats that run that state Pritzker are seizing it this is like what happened in
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:39:07.160]  Michigan when the Democrat representative had COVID and was dying and the mayor of Michigan
[1:39:07.160 --> 1:39:12.920]  banned the use of hydroxychloroquine and zinc so she had to go onto the black market to
[1:39:12.920 --> 1:39:17.760]  get hydroxychloroquine and zinc and within a day after taking hydroxychloroquine and
[1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:23.080]  zinc was recovered from COVID she thanked Trump for saving her life I mean ultimately
[1:39:23.080 --> 1:39:27.000]  it was the hydroxychloroquine and and and zinc and vitamin D that saved her life but
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:33.120]  it was Trump that made it legal for doctors to send prescriptions across state lines despite
[1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:38.880]  the Democrats trying to stop that why are Democrats so evil you just have to wonder
[1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:47.640]  and why are Republicans such pussies in fighting back against these tyrants it's always tough
[1:39:47.640 --> 1:39:52.380]  to predict says Fauci when asked how long it will be till vaccinated people can be indoors
[1:39:52.380 --> 1:40:00.880]  without a mask no it's really not under Fauci you'll always be a slave you'll never take
[1:40:00.880 --> 1:40:07.120]  the mask off you'll never get enough vaccines you'll never be able to take the mask off
[1:40:07.120 --> 1:40:13.640]  isn't it amazing I'm actually I'll tell you what I'm surprised more people haven't woken
[1:40:13.640 --> 1:40:17.440]  up to the lies of Fauci than we've seen yeah some people get it like hey I'm vaccinated
[1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:20.840]  why do I have to wear a mask hey I'm vaccinated why am I getting sick hey I'm vaccinated why
[1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:25.200]  do I have to take another one it's only a small percentage of people that are even understanding
[1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:31.600]  that dynamic that Fauci is lying to you and that you'll never get out of the the grips
[1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:37.480]  of this tyranny but yes here you go here is just yet another example this is the official
[1:40:37.480 --> 1:40:50.520]  trailer on YouTube for Dr. Fauci and it has 103,000 dislikes 7,000 likes rotten tomatoes
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:59.320]  banned reviews banned reviews and banned the audience score on the Fauci documentary because
[1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:04.920]  all the reviews that were coming in were anti Fauci anti vaccine and it would have scored
[1:41:04.920 --> 1:41:13.040]  it zero so they banned it so so you know I forget who made this point and actually I
[1:41:13.040 --> 1:41:21.160]  think it was Alex earlier which is we've already reached the threshold to save this planet
[1:41:21.160 --> 1:41:25.160]  and to save America from the new world order and from the globalist we just haven't realized
[1:41:25.160 --> 1:41:32.200]  it yet and so there's going to be a process of realizing it like in like in a bug's life
[1:41:32.200 --> 1:41:36.840]  when when the ants finally stand up to the grasshoppers there's there's first the moment
[1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:43.360]  of realization then there's the moment of action and then that's when the grasshoppers
[1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:49.760]  flee so so first we'll realize we're in the massive majority then we'll start to game
[1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:56.160]  plan and understand how we can throw the tyrants off of our necks off of our backs and that's
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:03.600]  when they flee and go into submission and hiding because they know that their game is up so
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:09.880]  so that's why Joe Biden has 10,000 people protesting anytime he travels and nobody supporting
[1:42:09.880 --> 1:42:13.480]  that's why he couldn't have a rally that's why Trump had 40,000 people at a rally in
[1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:17.920]  Iowa over the weekend that's why every Joe Biden video on YouTube has massive dislikes
[1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:23.240]  and no likes that's why every Fauci video on YouTube has massive dislikes and no likes
[1:42:23.240 --> 1:42:28.000]  that's why every local Democrat here in Austin posts on Twitter and his 200 replies saying
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:31.360]  how much they've destroyed the city and how we're never going to vote for them again and
[1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:36.760]  all this stuff these people are losers they're unpopular they're they're not winning fairly
[1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:42.880]  they're cheating but see we just haven't realized it because all the control mechanisms and
[1:42:42.880 --> 1:42:48.800]  all the Tokyo roses in the media aren't letting us see that we are in the mass majority we
[1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:58.320]  are just a flick away from victory as soon as we realize that the ball is in our hands.
[1:42:58.320 --> 1:43:03.000]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:08.640]  between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other
[1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:11.560]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[1:43:11.560 --> 1:43:16.440]  From the United States to Brazil and of course triggered by the bricks in the UK, nations
[1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:21.120]  were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government that's why they launched
[1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:27.320]  their great recess and their program after collapsing us of build back better.
[1:43:27.320 --> 1:43:33.320]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy because
[1:43:33.320 --> 1:43:38.240]  they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left which is the ideology
[1:43:38.240 --> 1:43:44.080]  of this world government system couldn't win they released a biological weapon on us.
[1:43:44.080 --> 1:43:47.960]  Now we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[1:43:47.960 --> 1:43:52.520]  It's that simple they can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns so the global
[1:43:52.520 --> 1:43:57.200]  corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history expose this paradigm
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:43:58.560]  and we win.
[1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:03.560]  People ask me all the time Alex the last three months or so you've had explosive energy on

[1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:41.760]  by the way series of headlines right here price of ship fuel is now highest since 2014
[1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:47.400]  all thanks to the plan Demek UK Steel warns of eminent crisis due to extraordinary electricity
[1:47:47.400 --> 1:47:54.720]  prices because of the plan Demek aluminum tops 3000 per ton for first time since 2008
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:48:01.920]  because of the plan Demek and now you have thousands of flights being canceled because
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:07.560]  of the vaccine mandate and they say oh well it's because of weather and then that's easily
[1:48:07.560 --> 1:48:14.840]  to just that's easy to disprove so then they say oh it's because people are getting sick
[1:48:14.840 --> 1:48:20.640]  how are people a massive people just getting sick overnight from the vaccine so so like
[1:48:20.640 --> 1:48:23.440]  they didn't even want to admit that but then they had to owe people getting sick from the
[1:48:23.440 --> 1:48:30.200]  vaccine but the truth is because there's a walkout because of the vaccine mandates let
[1:48:30.200 --> 1:48:36.760]  me just do this quickly let's let's play some of these insane videos here first let's go
[1:48:36.760 --> 1:48:43.240]  to this clip six this is unbelievable a 16 year old girl who's showing more courage than
[1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:49.200]  most men right now refusing to comply with the mask mandate at her Wyoming high school
[1:48:49.200 --> 1:48:56.960]  and so she shows up folks she gets arrested she gets fined and the whole high school goes
[1:48:56.960 --> 1:49:03.400]  into lockdown I kid you not a little girl 16 year old shows up in high school without
[1:49:03.400 --> 1:49:11.480]  a mask and the whole school goes into lockdown as if she was a mass shooter and then she gets
[1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:22.480]  arrested unbelievable scenes here is the video in clip six I can't unless you're gonna wear
[1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:30.880]  a mask so you're taking my right to go to school well I need I need you to wear a mask
[1:49:30.880 --> 1:49:38.040]  because that's what we got to do right now good Nazi well I guess I'll just sit here
[1:49:38.040 --> 1:49:48.280]  okay so on this and I just the part of the protocol is to ask for a student's signature
[1:49:48.280 --> 1:49:52.960]  and you know it's obviously up to you but all it says is I hereby acknowledge that I
[1:49:52.960 --> 1:49:57.320]  participated in a pre suspension conference that was just me going over this with you
[1:49:57.320 --> 1:50:03.040]  with the administrator that's me Brady signed it but and I'm aware of the reason for my
[1:50:03.040 --> 1:50:08.840]  suspension I understand and agree that I am not to be on or near any ACS D1 school grounds
[1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:12.920]  or participate in school activities during the suspension event suspended they've asked
[1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:19.480]  you to leave sounds like you're refusing all right so as law enforcement I am now respectfully
[1:50:19.480 --> 1:50:23.240]  requesting that you leave the premises because you've been suspended are you willing to do
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:29.280]  that no okay so I'm gonna formally warn your trust pass and if you want to stay they receive
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:34.880]  another citation for trespass normally one of trespass you want to leave the facility

[1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:49.720]  to stay how long are you planning on staying for I don't know okay I'm gonna go right to
[1:50:49.720 --> 1:50:54.600]  citation for you I'm gonna let you know what's going on at this point this entire building
[1:50:54.600 --> 1:50:59.600]  now is in lockdown so you have now restricted the movement of over a thousand students or
[1:50:59.600 --> 1:51:07.840]  now is right there the insanity of this he's blaming her a sweet innocent 16 year old girl
[1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:13.720]  standing in her high school during school hours and they're blaming her because they put the
[1:51:13.720 --> 1:51:19.880]  school over lockdown because he's not wearing a mask clown world insanity this is the planet
[1:51:19.880 --> 1:51:26.080]  we want to live on this is the country we want to live in a whole school goes into complete
[1:51:26.080 --> 1:51:32.600]  irrational illogical panic because one girl without a mask and then she's so brave I salute
[1:51:32.600 --> 1:51:40.440]  this young girl she's so brave that she stands there facing arrest this is a modern day this
[1:51:40.440 --> 1:51:49.000]  is a modern day I mean you could say Joan of Arc or if you wanted to do a American history
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:53.840]  this is like you know a modern day Martin Luther King or hell John Lewis dare I say
[1:51:53.840 --> 1:52:00.840]  or Rosa Parks knowing they're gonna be arrested for standing there but doing it anyway to
[1:52:00.840 --> 1:52:06.440]  prove a point seriously are you listening to this oh you didn't wear a mask we're suspending
[1:52:06.440 --> 1:52:11.600]  you oh by the way now you're now you're trespassing on school territory so we're gonna arrest you
[1:52:11.600 --> 1:52:19.040]  and we're gonna lock the school down complete insanity yeah this is like this is like this
[1:52:19.040 --> 1:52:23.040]  is actual civil rights stuff right here this is like the civil rights movement when when
[1:52:23.040 --> 1:52:28.560]  black civil rights activists would go sit on the front of buses or go to or go to diners
[1:52:28.560 --> 1:52:34.760]  or go to restaurants and they would refuse to leave or they'd refuse to not sit in the
[1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:39.080]  blacks only section and they would face arrest or punishment or beatings or all this other
[1:52:39.080 --> 1:52:43.640]  stuff because they knew it was right so I salute this 16 year old girl she has more
[1:52:43.640 --> 1:52:49.720]  will and and and passion and inspiration than pretty much 99% of this country right now
[1:52:49.720 --> 1:52:55.320]  sadly but again they put the whole school in lockdown because she's standing in the
[1:52:55.320 --> 1:53:01.400]  common section without a mask do you really want to live in this insane society let's
[1:53:01.400 --> 1:53:24.480]  continue the video now pause it right there again because this is the dynamic that people
[1:53:24.480 --> 1:53:31.320]  have to understand I get honestly see this is why people become suicidal I mean you follow
[1:53:31.320 --> 1:53:37.320]  this logic the only path is to just blow your brains out it's the same thing oh COVID shut
[1:53:37.320 --> 1:53:43.040]  everything down COVID closed our business close COVID COVID COVID no the government did that
[1:53:43.040 --> 1:53:48.200]  the government did that not COVID so it's the same thing here they're blaming this little
[1:53:48.200 --> 1:53:53.080]  girl they're saying you put the school in lockdown you're stopping students from learning
[1:53:53.080 --> 1:53:58.960]  you're stopping students from communicating and and getting from classroom to classroom
[1:53:58.960 --> 1:54:04.000]  no she's not you're doing that you bastards you're doing that officer you're doing that
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:08.400]  superintendent you're doing that principal you're doing that professor not the innocent
[1:54:08.400 --> 1:54:14.440]  girl but see so that's what they do oh they make the virus they release the virus then
[1:54:14.440 --> 1:54:20.200]  they shut everything down and they blame the virus same thing here oh oh they arrest the
[1:54:20.200 --> 1:54:25.640]  girl harass the girl suspend the girl and then lock down the school and then blame the girl
[1:54:25.640 --> 1:54:34.040]  standing there without a mask on I am in insane clown world society times right now let's go
[1:54:34.040 --> 1:54:54.880]  back to the video this court days November 16th at 9 o'clock I'm still refusing to leave
[1:54:54.880 --> 1:55:07.520]  they said they'll arrest me if I continue to refuse so you're still refusing to leave
[1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:37.400]  so that's Gray Smith 16-year-old high school student Wyoming who has who
[1:55:37.400 --> 1:55:44.680]  has more of a hero's will and spirit and more will to be free and stand up for what's right
[1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:57.200]  the 99% of this country pardon me while I stand and applaud and I hope everybody out
[1:55:57.200 --> 1:56:05.160]  there applaud for grace as well and we should be praying for grace and there should be thousands
[1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:10.140]  of peaceful protesters outside of the courtroom on her court date it sounded like they said
[1:56:10.140 --> 1:56:17.520]  November 16th Gray Smith is a hero that is an American hero that is an icon we salute
[1:56:17.520 --> 1:56:25.600]  you grace we stand with you grace we need tens of thousands millions of students like
[1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:35.280]  Gray Smith man I wish I wish I wish even a small percentage of this country had even
[1:56:35.280 --> 1:56:41.040]  a small percentage of Grace's will and spirit we could end all this madness overnight but
[1:56:41.040 --> 1:56:48.960]  no a little innocent 16-year-old girl that's like the tank man but it's a it's a girl that's
[1:56:48.960 --> 1:56:55.640]  like the Tiananmen tank square man except it's a high school student in America bullied
[1:56:55.640 --> 1:57:02.760]  into medical tyranny refuses to submit threatened with arrest intimidated harassed blame for
[1:57:02.760 --> 1:57:07.560]  the school being shut down still refuses to admit to the submit to the tyranny so they
[1:57:07.560 --> 1:57:12.080]  have to put her in handcuffs and throw her in jail and give her a court date that's a
[1:57:12.080 --> 1:57:18.240]  hero Gray Smith right there so I'll say this any high schoolers listening to this they're
[1:57:18.240 --> 1:57:23.360]  sick of your mandates and sick of dealing with this crap take a page out of Gray Smith's
[1:57:23.360 --> 1:57:30.080]  book and you'll be an American legend and an icon at your high school Gray Smith now
[1:57:30.080 --> 1:57:37.880]  goes down in American history and folklore as a civil rights hero she's up there with
[1:57:37.880 --> 1:57:42.960]  Rosa Parks and everyone else now she is a civil rights hero she sacrificed herself for
[1:57:42.960 --> 1:57:48.120]  something bigger and greater than her so that we all could see it and want to be free by
[1:57:48.120 --> 1:57:52.480]  now you've heard me talk about the bio pros and how they're creating amazing products

[1:59:47.360 --> 2:00:05.880]  those you're listening to the alex jones show you're about to be joined here in studio by
[2:00:05.880 --> 2:00:10.280]  a hospital whistleblower on some just insane things that are happening at the hospital
[2:00:10.280 --> 2:00:14.560]  and I just saw a little story here that had me laughing out loud in the break seriously
[2:00:14.560 --> 2:00:18.960]  the clown world of all of this is just I can't even believe I'm living in this reality at
[2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:28.040]  this point and it's like a mental thing to just almost keep saying is to just say this
[2:00:28.040 --> 2:00:33.560]  is all some sort of weird simulation game that I'm in this is not real this is just
[2:00:33.560 --> 2:00:38.760]  a test because it's just insane from locking down a school because a girl without a mask
[2:00:38.760 --> 2:00:43.440]  and then blaming her for it to what we're about to get into with this hospital whistleblower
[2:00:43.440 --> 2:00:47.720]  just total clown world but let me just talk about something else that's going on right
[2:00:47.720 --> 2:00:53.080]  now first of all you know Biden went on another vacation over the weekend guys roll just beat
[2:00:53.080 --> 2:00:59.380]  roll the B roll of clip nine and so this was Biden he went on a vacation to Delaware over
[2:00:59.380 --> 2:01:04.000]  the weekend he's constantly vacationing while the country is in total crisis but notice
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  something about this B roll here notice something about this video everyone and he can't even
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:14.120]  walk off the stairs folks he has to go down backwards clenching to the rails because he
[2:01:14.120 --> 2:01:19.800]  can't walk down steps when it's windy or he'll blow over like a like a feather in the wind
[2:01:19.800 --> 2:01:25.400]  but notice how everybody else in this video is forced to wear a mask even the young kids
[2:01:25.400 --> 2:01:29.980]  so it's a bunch of young kids wearing a mask it's the pilot and everybody else everybody
[2:01:29.980 --> 2:01:38.760]  wearing a mask except one person not wearing the mask Joe Biden everyone masked but Joe
[2:01:38.760 --> 2:01:45.760]  Biden is up with that so there's Joe Biden departing for another vacation as he scuttles
[2:01:45.760 --> 2:01:54.560]  the country into chaos and division and degradation but then you have this guys roll the B roll
[2:01:54.560 --> 2:02:05.680]  from clip one so this was I guess Friday before Biden departed for vacation and guys you can
[2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:10.000]  just keep the B roll rolling and I'm gonna try to explain what's going on here so we
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:16.040]  now know that they have a fake White House a fake White House where Joe Biden does his
[2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:20.920]  press conferences and such that's not a conspiracy theory we reported it first it's a fake White
[2:02:20.920 --> 2:02:26.680]  House literally it's a studio set fake White House well I guess they're going full time
[2:02:26.680 --> 2:02:33.680]  to the fake White House now because on Friday the White House was closed to reporters and
[2:02:33.680 --> 2:02:36.840]  that's why at that one point in the video you see all the reporters rushing away from
[2:02:36.840 --> 2:02:41.200]  the White House to go to the fake White House the set the TV set White House guys just keep
[2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:47.480]  the B roll on the screen so what is going on in the White House that nobody's allowed
[2:02:47.480 --> 2:02:51.640]  in the White House and they don't do press conferences from the White House anymore
[2:02:51.640 --> 2:02:56.720]  they only do it from the fake White House the TV set this is I've never heard of this
[2:02:56.720 --> 2:03:02.720]  before they literally have a fake White House oh and by the way all the reporters cheering
[2:03:02.720 --> 2:03:07.720]  Joe Biden in fact guys we should actually listen to this because I'm pretty sure there's audio
[2:03:07.720 --> 2:03:13.880]  at that part too when Biden approaches the fake White House set and all the reporters
[2:03:13.880 --> 2:03:19.040]  start cheering for him that just shows you where the state of the media is in this country
[2:03:19.040 --> 2:03:23.800]  it will roll back around to that in a second but so it's they depart from the White House
[2:03:23.800 --> 2:03:27.400]  because they've had the White House shut down they don't do press conferences with the president's
[2:03:27.400 --> 2:03:32.480]  White House anymore they have all of it at the fake White House TV set so all the journalists
[2:03:32.480 --> 2:03:37.760]  have to rush over there guys we have a queued up to that listen to the listen this is folks
[2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:44.160]  this is the media this is the White House press pool as Joe Biden is approaching the
[2:03:44.160 --> 2:03:49.320]  media at the fake White House listen to the White House press pool when he approaches
[2:03:49.320 --> 2:04:01.680]  listen to this why are they cheering him what are they doing alright guys so there
[2:04:01.680 --> 2:04:07.520]  we go so again why do they have a fake White House why do they have a TV set that Biden
[2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:13.760]  goes to why is the White House press pool cheering on the president why is he vacationing
[2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:23.000]  every weekend what is going on here why is he bragging when somebody wipes his butt what
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:29.200]  is going on Biden mocks for Truman so presidency over fake White House set like that sounds
[2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:35.800]  crazy I get it somebody tunes into this and they say hey who's this crazy guy on TV who's
[2:04:35.800 --> 2:04:41.000]  this crazy guy on the radio saying that there's a fake White House it's just me oh and Troy
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:47.200]  from info wars and there is a fake White House but then over the weekend as we see every
[2:04:47.200 --> 2:04:53.200]  weekend the let's go Brandon Chance aka F Joe Biden every college football stadium every
[2:04:53.200 --> 2:05:00.200]  baseball stadium they now get the signs up behind the cameras that say let's go Brandon
[2:05:00.200 --> 2:05:05.400]  to could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank with your face covered could you imagine
[2:05:05.400 --> 2:05:09.200]  even going into the grocery store do you think they would like you in do you think they would
[2:05:09.200 --> 2:05:13.280]  be following you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't going to be shoplifting could
[2:05:13.280 --> 2:05:19.120]  you imagine going up to a gas station and going inside the little mini mart to pay for
[2:05:19.120 --> 2:05:24.000]  your gas with a bandana on how far do you think that would get you could you imagine as a
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:29.560]  teacher showing up to school with it with a shield that looks like a space alien those
[2:05:29.560 --> 2:05:36.960]  things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction the globalist
[2:05:36.960 --> 2:05:41.560]  are running a psychological warfare operation on humanity only waking up to the great reset
[2:05:41.560 --> 2:05:47.240]  in its tyranny will save us and the mask is the sign of slavery we must inform the public
[2:05:47.240 --> 2:05:51.880]  that it's a fraud and it's dangerous and it causes major medical issues and it's dehumanizing

[2:05:57.320 --> 2:06:07.800]  copy of in game with your purchase
[2:06:07.800 --> 2:06:18.800]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow with a win tryer you may remember
[2:06:18.800 --> 2:06:27.640]  i remember tuning into alex jones years ago and he would talk about how in the future
[2:06:27.640 --> 2:06:31.720]  they would say that there was no such thing as men and women there was no such thing as
[2:06:31.720 --> 2:06:36.400]  a woman being pregnant there was no such thing as breastfeeding there was no such thing as
[2:06:36.400 --> 2:06:42.320]  genders and you would hear all that and you knew that alex had a reputation of being accurate
[2:06:42.320 --> 2:06:47.000]  with his foreshadowing and his forecasting but but also his current events coverage but
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:50.400]  you know you hear something like that like out of a sci-fi novel and maybe you take it
[2:06:50.400 --> 2:06:54.800]  with a grain of salt or maybe you're just like i don't agree with that well folks that
[2:06:54.800 --> 2:07:02.200]  time is now upon us and so we have a hospital whistleblower here that's going to explain
[2:07:02.200 --> 2:07:09.440]  what's going on but it's it's headlines like this that i i almost spit my coffee out in
[2:07:09.440 --> 2:07:14.560]  the break reading this headline are there unintended consequences to calling breastfeeding
[2:07:14.560 --> 2:07:22.000]  natural what i mean okay are there unintended unintended consequences of calling pregnancy
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:27.800]  natural calling a man and a woman being in love natural what are the unintended unintended
[2:07:27.800 --> 2:07:32.840]  consequences well the unintended consequences they can't have their new world order that's
[2:07:32.840 --> 2:07:36.320]  the unintended consequences they can't have a new world order when men and women come
[2:07:36.320 --> 2:07:40.400]  together and make families and have babies and fall in love then the whole new world
[2:07:40.400 --> 2:07:47.040]  order fails that's why destroying the nuclear family is numero uno on the new world orders
[2:07:47.040 --> 2:07:55.400]  agenda and that's why smart people when they read the manifestos of antifa or car marks
[2:07:55.400 --> 2:07:59.120]  or black lives matter and it says destroy the nuclear family they say wait a second we don't
[2:07:59.120 --> 2:08:05.440]  want to destroy the nuclear family why would we want to do that a man and a woman coming
[2:08:05.440 --> 2:08:10.240]  together is natural oh but in the new world order it's not that's criminal see you're
[2:08:10.240 --> 2:08:18.560]  a bigot how dare you and yeah they claim men can get pregnant now too i mean i just want
[2:08:18.560 --> 2:08:27.320]  to vomit i'm just gonna yak all over the desk here it's just disgusting seriously almost
[2:08:27.320 --> 2:08:33.400]  spit my coffee out reading that but speaking of info wars coffee i'm not even kidding you
[2:08:33.400 --> 2:08:39.040]  when i got into studio this morning or when i left my office and i started to put some
[2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:46.360]  of the news on my desk said you know what i could really go for a fresh brew right now
[2:08:46.360 --> 2:08:53.640]  of info wars coffee and i opened up the studio door over there and i went through some of
[2:08:53.640 --> 2:08:58.680]  the office space and then into the hallway where the break room is at the end and i had
[2:08:58.680 --> 2:09:05.880]  a whiff of the aromas coming from the break room and i knew immediately what was going

[2:09:54.160 --> 2:10:00.080]  so popular and and they're just so great the best on the market and so they sell out all
[2:10:00.080 --> 2:10:04.960]  the time and so there'll be times here where i'm plugging a product that was in stock yesterday
[2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:08.920]  and then they pull it up on the website it's sold out so folks take advantage of these

[2:12:04.840 --> 2:12:09.760]  the banks are closed people can't retrieve their money there's massive power outages
[2:12:09.760 --> 2:12:17.480]  and blackouts and energy shortages and this is happening in lebanon right now and so unrest
[2:12:17.480 --> 2:12:23.720]  is growing and it's just not good but this is this is what it's going to look like as
[2:12:23.720 --> 2:12:30.160]  the new world order rears its ugly head and tries to assert itself as the global government
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:37.320]  dominating every sovereign nation state so lebanon wants to be a sovereign nation secular
[2:12:37.320 --> 2:12:43.920]  new world order hates that and so they're just shutting it down it's really sad really really
[2:12:43.920 --> 2:12:52.840]  sad uh so that's happening in lebanon let's see what else we got here uh we have in road
[2:12:52.840 --> 2:12:59.040]  island guys roll just roll the b roll from clip seven uh road island massive protest
[2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:07.080]  against the vaccine mandates and then police just arresting people out of nowhere so massive
[2:13:07.080 --> 2:13:11.440]  protest show in road island i forget i think it was maybe in front of a government building
[2:13:11.440 --> 2:13:16.440]  or something a huge amount of people show up and they start asking questions of the police
[2:13:16.440 --> 2:13:23.320]  officers and the police officers just start arresting them because they don't want to be
[2:13:23.320 --> 2:13:30.920]  a part of vaccine passport mandates so real ugly scenes in road island thank the new world
[2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:35.800]  order for this oh it's outside the governor's house thank you so they're protesting the
[2:13:35.800 --> 2:13:41.760]  governor demanding answers refusing the vaccine mandate police start arresting people so uh
[2:13:41.760 --> 2:13:48.120]  yeah this is just this is just the chaos and this is just a division that is going to persist
[2:13:48.120 --> 2:13:52.200]  under the new world order until they assert themselves and dominate all of us and they'll
[2:13:52.200 --> 2:13:56.640]  just arrest everybody who doesn't comply that's that's their ultimate goal they're building
[2:13:56.640 --> 2:14:01.880]  those camps right now and now let's go to clip eight listen to this this is this this
[2:14:01.880 --> 2:14:11.000]  is a can you imagine taking orders from this orc looking freak the chief medical officer
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:17.360]  chorisa tam in canada who wants you spying on your friends and neighbors and and constantly
[2:14:17.360 --> 2:14:23.240]  asking people about their vaccination status look at this demented freak in clip eight
[2:14:23.240 --> 2:14:32.600]  but our advice really is that overall keep indoor gatherings safer by you know asking
[2:14:32.600 --> 2:14:39.400]  your guests it is a difficult question sometimes but ask your family or if you had people outside
[2:14:39.400 --> 2:14:44.360]  of your family that you're thinking inviting do try and ask them whether they've been vaccinated
[2:14:44.360 --> 2:14:52.320]  or not and take that into account use precautions including spacing or physical distancing if
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:59.200]  you can and masking where appropriate if some family members particularly who have high
[2:14:59.200 --> 2:15:06.640]  risk conditions if you're not fully vaccinated and as we said then really should be limiting
[2:15:06.640 --> 2:15:13.720]  the gatherings to your household members and having things outdoors as much as possible
[2:15:13.720 --> 2:15:19.200]  but our advice really is that overall that's nice just ask everybody about their vaccine
[2:15:19.200 --> 2:15:23.520]  status ask if they've had a temperature check lately maybe even volunteer to give one you
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:27.240]  know rectally if they if they haven't you know it's all fun and games it's it's medical
[2:15:27.240 --> 2:15:31.400]  tyranny and it just freaks like that telling you to do it and now look at this sick clip
[2:15:31.400 --> 2:15:37.720]  in clip 11 this is the new dancing nurse videos nurses bragging because they're making more
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:41.520]  money than they ever have before and they're on vacation all the time look at this in clip
[2:15:41.520 --> 2:15:49.400]  11 if you're not on vacation because we're travel nurses and we abide by the mask mandates
[2:15:49.400 --> 2:15:55.840]  and we're fully vaccinated that we're the oh boy yeah so tough in the hospitals on

[2:20:20.240 --> 2:20:28.640]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live here on the alex jones show and for the week i
[2:20:28.640 --> 2:20:33.840]  mean so far alex has done a pretty good job taking a vacation he's usually really bad
[2:20:33.840 --> 2:20:42.160]  at that but so far he's done okay and so we'll continue to hope alex gets some rest and relaxation
[2:20:42.160 --> 2:20:46.480]  on a vacation i'll be filling in hosting duties here but we will be hearing from alex
[2:20:46.480 --> 2:20:52.400]  i'm sure and now in studio with me is emi robin a big resume here i won't get into all of it
[2:20:53.120 --> 2:20:59.120]  all kinds of experience but the important thing is she is a certified birth and postpartum doula
[2:20:59.120 --> 2:21:04.880]  childbirth educator and breastfeeding counselor and she's been dealing with pregnant women for a
[2:21:04.880 --> 2:21:12.720]  long time and specifically though what you're noticing is an interesting change i guess you
[2:21:12.720 --> 2:21:17.200]  could say and you can kind of elaborate on this but we'll start it we'll start it with this notion
[2:21:17.200 --> 2:21:23.440]  here and and what they're really implicating or implying with a headline like this from cnn are
[2:21:23.440 --> 2:21:31.520]  their unintended consequences to calling breastfeeding natural so it's not just breastfeeding though
[2:21:31.520 --> 2:21:37.040]  it's birth it's the whole process of a man and a woman and a woman being pregnant and giving birth
[2:21:37.040 --> 2:21:42.480]  and then breastfeeding it's the attack of that entire natural process trying to claim it's
[2:21:42.480 --> 2:21:48.240]  not natural or i guess somehow it's it's a bad thing so so what are you noticing with these
[2:21:48.240 --> 2:21:54.800]  implications as somebody that's around pregnant women um and and involved with the process of birth
[2:21:55.760 --> 2:22:02.000]  for years now yeah i mean it's just it's it's crazy it's it's literally insane what's happening
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:07.920]  and what's going on and um you know just the the fear that's that's going on right now and
[2:22:07.920 --> 2:22:14.720]  and birth is very natural it's a physiological thing i have to stop you right there though what
[2:22:14.720 --> 2:22:19.760]  do you mean by fear well there's just so much there's there's a lot of fear going on in the
[2:22:19.760 --> 2:22:24.480]  world right now and a lot of pregnant women that are reaching out to me you know via you know
[2:22:24.480 --> 2:22:28.800]  facebook message or texting me women i don't even know women that are being referred to me from
[2:22:28.800 --> 2:22:34.320]  friends because of my education and because of what i do and they're just asking for an obgyn who's
[2:22:34.320 --> 2:22:40.400]  more natural thinking right and that's to me that that blows my mind because an obgyn got their
[2:22:40.400 --> 2:22:44.720]  education they understand birth they understand what happens to a woman's body they understand
[2:22:44.720 --> 2:22:49.520]  growing a baby they understand medications that you know women can't take they understand foods
[2:22:49.520 --> 2:22:53.840]  that women can't eat when they're pregnant things like that right so they're they're they're feeling
[2:22:53.840 --> 2:22:58.720]  bullied right now they're just feeling bullied through the entire birth process um that's got
[2:22:58.720 --> 2:23:03.520]  to be awful too because you're talking about such an important thing in your life where there is a
[2:23:03.520 --> 2:23:07.920]  lot of questions and there's a lot of stuff regarding your health that you just want confidence
[2:23:07.920 --> 2:23:12.560]  in answers and that's what i see coming from hospitals too it's a lot of bullying it's a lot
[2:23:12.560 --> 2:23:16.880]  of bullying and when you're talking about a pregnant woman who's already going through all kinds of
[2:23:16.880 --> 2:23:22.240]  physiological changes plus the added effect of having yeah having a baby that they have to take
[2:23:22.240 --> 2:23:27.040]  care of too i imagine that going through the bullying process just makes it more complicated
[2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:34.080]  yeah i mean it's i just i i i've had this like uh inside of me where i've i've broken down crying
[2:23:34.080 --> 2:23:38.400]  you know after talking to some moms from like what's going on with them there's you know there's
[2:23:38.400 --> 2:23:43.360]  women that you know are being pushed my my business is growing my business is booming women are wanting
[2:23:43.360 --> 2:23:47.680]  to do natural childbirth women are wanting to do birth at home and birth and birth centers because
[2:23:47.680 --> 2:23:52.560]  they're not as you know they're not being bullied they can do it with a midwife um but there are
[2:23:52.560 --> 2:23:58.080]  women out there that are high risk or that absolutely need a hospital they need a hospital
[2:23:58.080 --> 2:24:03.200]  to have a baby and they're scared they're super scared and they're reaching out to me because
[2:24:03.200 --> 2:24:11.120]  they're like i do you know any of these obgyns that aren't going to force me to get a vaccine right so
[2:24:11.120 --> 2:24:16.800]  like i i had someone reach out to me the other day and and they're they're having an oopsie baby
[2:24:16.800 --> 2:24:20.560]  right like their third baby they didn't they didn't plan on having another baby but she's scared
[2:24:20.560 --> 2:24:26.560]  she hasn't done it in 10 years so she's like now i need to find a provider right and she's saying that
[2:24:27.760 --> 2:24:34.640]  there are providers she's called six around town and they're not taking on new clients unless
[2:24:34.640 --> 2:24:41.920]  they have a vaccine and she's like scared she's freaking out i i felt her fear through the phone
[2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:48.400]  like that would freak me out if i was pregnant i knew i needed a hospital to have my baby and now
[2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:55.440]  all of a sudden i i can't find a provider that will take me on because of a decision that i don't
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:25:01.040]  want to make so let's let's humanize this for a second because there's always an intimidation
[2:25:01.040 --> 2:25:05.920]  that comes along with an authority figure and that's why authority figures have badges and
[2:25:05.920 --> 2:25:10.000]  uniforms it's a psychological thing and you can say it's a good thing you can say it's a bad thing but
[2:25:10.800 --> 2:25:15.680]  what i'm seeing now and hearing now more than ever is the is the intimidation process happening at
[2:25:15.680 --> 2:25:21.840]  hospitals and so who knows you can go into hospital fully informed completely uninformed
[2:25:21.840 --> 2:25:26.800]  maybe a little bit informed maybe neutral maybe indifferent but as soon as you get in front of
[2:25:26.800 --> 2:25:31.120]  the doctors and it's the white coats and it's the stethoscopes and it's you know and and they're
[2:25:31.120 --> 2:25:34.880]  telling you you have to do this you have to do that there's evidence there's evidence that this
[2:25:34.880 --> 2:25:38.560]  works there's evidence that this works that's what i hear from the ob all the time telling my client
[2:25:38.560 --> 2:25:43.200]  i'll just kind of look at the client and be like i'm here to advocate for you but you have to use
[2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:47.920]  your voice we learned about this right so well and that's the problem is you it's like you're
[2:25:47.920 --> 2:25:51.840]  just sitting there you feel you're in a compromised position dealing with a team of doctors telling
[2:25:51.840 --> 2:25:56.640]  you that this is the only way and even if it goes against your gut instincts you're now in a position
[2:25:56.640 --> 2:26:03.040]  of going against these doctors and and and having them belittle you but really it's it's what you
[2:26:03.040 --> 2:26:10.640]  have to do it's your gut instinct yeah and it's it's super it's scary it is scary right and and
[2:26:10.640 --> 2:26:15.200]  to have birth we'll we'll back it up physiologically like what happens in labor is
[2:26:15.760 --> 2:26:20.800]  you need to have oxytocin by the way have you ever dealt with a man that's pregnant no okay i just
[2:26:20.800 --> 2:26:26.640]  wanted to make sure all right all right go on though i'm barely not but i'm told it can i don't
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:33.920]  know no this just physiologically what happens to a woman's body you need oxytocin the natural
[2:26:33.920 --> 2:26:39.840]  hormone that we produce it's called the love hormone oxytocin you need that in labor right
[2:26:39.840 --> 2:26:45.920]  that helps labor progress that helps labor move along so my job is to turn the lights down and
[2:26:45.920 --> 2:26:51.760]  you know try to try to release this oxytocin and help help the woman help the partner help the woman
[2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:56.000]  you know release oxytocin right but they have betosin they have a synthetic version of oxytocin
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:59.840]  that they can give women right it's it's what they use to induce it's what they use to help labor
[2:26:59.840 --> 2:27:06.000]  along in the hospitals but it's like when you're scared when you have fear when you have any cortisol
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:12.320]  or any any of these opposite hormones running through your body it's going to block it's going
[2:27:12.320 --> 2:27:18.000]  to block that oxytocin which is going to stall out labor it's going to cause issues it's going to
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:22.320]  you know to where the doctor has to come in and they have to help move along and they have to
[2:27:22.320 --> 2:27:27.520]  intervene and interventions you know there's evidence that interventions can lead to risks
[2:27:27.520 --> 2:27:35.440]  right so it's it starts with get rid of the fear get rid of the bullying when you're no matter
[2:27:35.440 --> 2:27:42.080]  where you decide to have your baby right it's it starts with being educated being confident in
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:50.240]  what you're going into right and just kind of allowing yourself to be happy while you're doing
[2:27:50.240 --> 2:27:56.320]  this see this is this is your expertise and we're about to go to break here but I mean my kind of
[2:27:56.320 --> 2:28:04.240]  I guess comparison to this would be the whole breastfeeding versus formula equation yeah where
[2:28:04.240 --> 2:28:10.080]  the benefits of breastfeeding are I mean paramount it's everything you have to breastfeed versus the
[2:28:10.080 --> 2:28:15.840]  babies that get the formula lower IQs lower brain function mental disabilities all of this stuff
[2:28:15.840 --> 2:28:20.320]  but yet the formula gets promoted by doctors the formulas told us the same as breastfeeding
[2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:24.720]  that's just a lie but they bully people into believing it oh I mean their studies they've
[2:28:24.720 --> 2:28:31.200]  they have changed hospital protocol think heavens that they've changed protocol to where skin to skin
[2:28:31.200 --> 2:28:35.920]  is a necessity after birth like they they will put that baby's skin to skin because they know
[2:28:35.920 --> 2:28:41.200]  the benefits they know that it lowers the um but isn't that being stopped now because of covid
[2:28:42.480 --> 2:28:47.840]  I would hope not well I mean that's what I've seen is I mean we have all these videos and images
[2:28:47.840 --> 2:28:52.800]  I've seen articles the mothers have their newborn baby and they like put it in a plastic bag the
[2:28:52.800 --> 2:28:56.960]  mother's in a hazmat suit we'll be right back with more of this pregnant mothers tune in this is
[2:28:56.960 --> 2:29:01.040]  very important information if you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own

[2:29:06.480 --> 2:29:12.720]  here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock these emergency backup
[2:29:12.720 --> 2:29:18.400]  systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most and unlike gas generators solar

[2:32:18.640 --> 2:32:23.120]  war but because of the supply chain breakdowns that were very easy to predict for the global lock
[2:32:23.120 --> 2:32:27.920]  downs they're designed to do that we have had real problems getting our best selling products in

[2:33:31.760 --> 2:33:40.080]  owin shroyer all right we have emmy robin in studio with us and she is well i guess dealing with
[2:33:40.080 --> 2:33:46.640]  more pregnant mothers than she ever has before because of all the bullying and intimidations
[2:33:46.640 --> 2:33:50.720]  and questions that come out of hospitals and they don't get the answers they want they want a natural
[2:33:50.720 --> 2:33:57.040]  birth so good for you i would say good for them as well and there's so much i want to get into
[2:33:57.040 --> 2:34:01.600]  here but let's start let's start with this let's start with what you're seeing in hospitals before
[2:34:01.600 --> 2:34:06.160]  we get into the natural versus the unnatural debate let's start what what are you seeing in
[2:34:06.160 --> 2:34:09.440]  hospitals what are what are pregnant mothers saying to you why are they coming to you why
[2:34:09.440 --> 2:34:13.520]  do you have more clients than ever before and and what is it that you're seeing and hearing
[2:34:13.520 --> 2:34:19.200]  about in hospitals that has you shocked or even horrified well i think just in general um you
[2:34:19.200 --> 2:34:24.800]  know the rate of cesareans have gone up over the years right so so now you're you're talking
[2:34:24.800 --> 2:34:30.160]  we're somewhere within the 30 percent range of women one in three women end up in a c-section a
[2:34:30.160 --> 2:34:34.320]  lot of women don't want to c-section some women do and i'm there as their doula to be like okay
[2:34:34.320 --> 2:34:37.600]  i'll be with you if you're and so tell me i mean obviously the medical procedure is different but
[2:34:37.600 --> 2:34:42.880]  tell me what what is what would be the benefits of having a natural birth versus a c-section or vice
[2:34:42.880 --> 2:34:49.760]  versa i mean well our bodies were made to do this right so you have the the natural birth if you
[2:34:49.760 --> 2:34:54.720]  have it vaginally without medication without epidurals without all that stuff right you're
[2:34:55.440 --> 2:34:59.760]  you're allowing the body to do what it does naturally right so afterwards you're gonna
[2:34:59.760 --> 2:35:04.320]  have that rush of hormones and oxytocin the milk's gonna come in a little bit easier
[2:35:05.040 --> 2:35:10.560]  you're gonna be able to hold your baby versus you know they are definitely giving out fentanyl
[2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:15.600]  in hospitals to pregnant women it's crazy but they do it if so so i guess it's more of a completing
[2:35:15.600 --> 2:35:21.840]  of the natural process instead of stunting it absolutely yeah just allow things happen to happen
[2:35:21.840 --> 2:35:27.200]  the way they physiologically should be happening right and that goes with postpartum soon as that
[2:35:27.200 --> 2:35:33.520]  baby's out of the canal you put it on the chest you put that baby's skin to skin why it helps
[2:35:33.520 --> 2:35:38.880]  regulate their temperature it helps regulate their blood sugar it helps their breathing they will
[2:35:38.880 --> 2:35:44.160]  actually synchronize their breathing with the mother's breathing it stimulates the vagus nerve
[2:35:44.160 --> 2:35:50.480]  when you stimulate the vagus nerve it it enlarges the villi in the in the villi i don't know how to
[2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:58.160]  pronounce that in the gut which actually will help create a bigger space in in your gut to
[2:35:58.160 --> 2:36:05.200]  absorb nutrition right so just skin to skin does that right and and that basic necessity i would
[2:36:05.200 --> 2:36:11.840]  say yeah is being denied in many hospitals because of quote unquote covid yeah i mean yeah some hospitals
[2:36:11.840 --> 2:36:17.280]  are are taking the baby away yeah let's let's destroy this baby right out of the womb because of
[2:36:17.280 --> 2:36:26.640]  covid it's i mean look i can speak to my education and the the benefit of placing that baby on the
[2:36:26.640 --> 2:36:31.680]  mother's chest whether she has the flu whether she has covid whether she has a cold whether
[2:36:31.680 --> 2:36:37.760]  any of that thing it's like the baby needs to be on the mom you put a baby in a warmer yeah there's
[2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:42.720]  a 30 000 machine that can warm the baby up after birth right but can that cool the baby down if the
[2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:48.320]  baby starts getting overheated the but see that 30 000 the hospital likes that well if you put a
[2:36:48.320 --> 2:36:56.480]  baby on the breast right the the body is so amazing and it's it's the miraculous stuff that happens
[2:36:56.480 --> 2:37:03.840]  postpartum but the breasts can actually heat up up to four degrees Fahrenheit and cool down within
[2:37:03.840 --> 2:37:08.560]  two minutes to adjust to what the baby needs to adjust to the baby's body temperature a warmer can't
[2:37:08.560 --> 2:37:13.120]  do that right they have to constantly watch the baby take the baby's temperature you know but see
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:17.440]  now you see this is kind of the stuff that people can understand it's following the money what costs
[2:37:17.440 --> 2:37:22.800]  more money a c-section or a natural birth oh i am all about if you are pregnant and you're
[2:37:22.800 --> 2:37:26.640]  going to be having a baby you need to watch the business of being born it's an amazing
[2:37:26.640 --> 2:37:33.280]  documentary ricky lake is the producer on it she's it's incredible but my guess is and you
[2:37:33.280 --> 2:37:37.680]  can confirm or deny my guess is the c-section hospital gets more money just like the heating
[2:37:37.680 --> 2:37:42.400]  machine the hospital gets more money well you have a vaginal birth you will leave the hospital
[2:37:42.400 --> 2:37:48.960]  24 48 hours later um walking home getting up walking around your house you have a c-section
[2:37:48.960 --> 2:37:54.000]  you're going to be kept there for three to five days ah cha-ching baby yeah so and it's you know
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:58.800]  you you have to have help getting up to go to the restroom you mean it's it's just it's it's a lot
[2:37:58.800 --> 2:38:02.880]  harder on your body to have a c-section see now i'm going to get into another thing here just quickly
[2:38:02.880 --> 2:38:09.200]  to change lanes yeah because there's this whole new push for women to chop their breasts off
[2:38:09.200 --> 2:38:13.360]  like without even proper i mean it's just like somebody says part of the same thing it's like
[2:38:13.360 --> 2:38:19.520]  that is part of humanity uh breasts are awesome okay like for a lot of different reasons and
[2:38:19.520 --> 2:38:23.200]  that's what they think they're oh just cut it off you might have cancer or hey we can predict if you
[2:38:23.200 --> 2:38:27.680]  have cancer just cut it off it turns out all that's probably fake anyway just like the theranos scam
[2:38:27.680 --> 2:38:32.080]  but that's the whole thing it's like hey if we just remove the breasts entirely then we don't have
[2:38:32.080 --> 2:38:36.080]  to worry about those pesky breasts making the babies healthy prophylactic mastectomies that
[2:38:36.080 --> 2:38:42.400]  happen yeah it's it's crazy like i mean if you look at the evidence-based studies they are also
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:48.480]  showing that if you breastfeed the longer you breastfeed the lower your risk for ovarian and
[2:38:48.480 --> 2:38:53.600]  breast cancer right so if you're somebody like myself my mother passed away from breast cancer
[2:38:53.600 --> 2:39:00.240]  so i know automatically i i believe in epigenetics i believe that maybe she was deficient by iodine
[2:39:00.240 --> 2:39:05.680]  and vitamin d which are linked to breast cancer right so i try to supplement that but also i know
[2:39:05.680 --> 2:39:12.560]  that in the 70s and 80s it wasn't as popular to breastfeed so my mom didn't breastfeed and that's
[2:39:12.560 --> 2:39:17.040]  when they introduced the formula and we're really pushing the formula correct so my mom did so again
[2:39:17.040 --> 2:39:21.600]  but i mean there it is again oh i have to buy the formula somebody's making money versus if i'm
[2:39:21.600 --> 2:39:26.720]  producing it naturally oh i mean and you want to talk about helping out low income communities
[2:39:26.720 --> 2:39:31.440]  you want to talk about really helping out the low income communities that are having babies right
[2:39:31.440 --> 2:39:39.440]  now mothers who cannot afford formula formula is expensive like i as a breastfeeding counselor and
[2:39:39.440 --> 2:39:45.360]  and currently looking into get in with wick because i would love anybody from wick please contact me
[2:39:45.360 --> 2:39:51.600]  i would love to help mothers who cannot afford to buy formula and really help them breastfeed
[2:39:51.600 --> 2:39:57.040]  because breastfeeding is hard it is a really hard skill and so this is and so this is a lot of
[2:39:57.040 --> 2:40:00.320]  this is a lot of information to go over you said that what was the name of that documentary you
[2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:06.240]  suggest pregnant mothers was business of being born it is an amazing documentary ricky lake
[2:40:06.240 --> 2:40:12.480]  produced it i want to say it came out early 2000s ever since that documentary has come out though
[2:40:12.480 --> 2:40:20.640]  there it is in midwifery the rise in um yeah the the rise in birth center births and home births has
[2:40:20.640 --> 2:40:26.800]  i mean it's exploded it's women are just scared to go to the hospital right they're very scared and
[2:40:26.800 --> 2:40:31.840]  you know it's a it's a it's a valid fear but as a doula i've seen the other side of it i've seen
[2:40:31.840 --> 2:40:37.040]  i've i have seen ob gyns that are amazing and they will they will honor the mother's birth plan
[2:40:37.040 --> 2:40:42.720]  it's very rare it's very few and far between and that gets back into the intimidation factor yeah
[2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:48.160]  absolutely the bullying but it it again with these texts and these messages that i'm getting daily
[2:40:48.160 --> 2:40:58.480]  it's now starting before even the birth process and i just even during this pandemic like for
[2:40:58.480 --> 2:41:06.080]  somebody who advocates for women and is a part of this insane process that happens it's it's
[2:41:06.080 --> 2:41:12.720]  exciting and amazing and scary and having a baby it's just crazy right and when i was seeing these
[2:41:12.720 --> 2:41:20.480]  reports of you know in other states during the the deep part of the pandemic um when they were
[2:41:20.480 --> 2:41:28.160]  denying the partners that they would just drop their their wives off at the front of the hospital
[2:41:28.160 --> 2:41:32.480]  and have to go sit in the parking lot and then they might not have any advocates in there with them
[2:41:32.480 --> 2:41:38.000]  no advocates right and that's creating trauma that's creating birth trauma that's creating trauma
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:45.040]  from the from the uh trump birth trauma is a very big part of postpartum depression i was gonna say
[2:41:45.040 --> 2:41:50.880]  you only get one shot no yeah this is this is this is a super important part of your life
[2:41:50.880 --> 2:42:00.080]  having a baby right and so my goal my job my goal as a as a doula as an advocate for these women
[2:42:00.080 --> 2:42:08.000]  is to you know try to keep birth trauma at a non-existent level right i i would like to have
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:14.640]  more oxytocin in there than cortisol and it's so hard right now it's so hard with what's going on
[2:42:14.640 --> 2:42:21.680]  and that just the fear and the you know everything that's just being pushed upon these women and
[2:42:21.680 --> 2:42:27.200]  not to mention and this is this is a little more of uh of a brain psychology type of thing but you
[2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:31.680]  might know more about this too of you know when you're in a situation like that of being
[2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:36.400]  feeling bullied feeling intimidated feeling pressured your brain is releasing other uh
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:41.120]  you know toxins and other kind of stuff that's going to affect that baby upon birth as well
[2:42:41.120 --> 2:42:49.440]  100% 100% if i mean if i can get anything out of being on here today and and talking to anybody
[2:42:49.440 --> 2:42:54.640]  who's pregnant or has put off getting pregnant because of this like i know people that were
[2:42:54.640 --> 2:42:57.600]  playing we got to go to break we got one more segment though we'll be right back we'll finish

[2:43:07.360 --> 2:43:13.200]  chains that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put in
[2:43:13.200 --> 2:43:20.720]  place it is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge it is the symbol
[2:43:20.720 --> 2:43:26.880]  that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light
[2:43:26.880 --> 2:43:36.320]  of the sun it is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil ladies and
[2:43:36.320 --> 2:43:43.120]  gentlemen we are crossing the rubicon now the entire future destiny of humanity is upon us
[2:43:43.680 --> 2:43:47.520]  claus Schwab and the unit admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the

[2:43:54.000 --> 2:44:00.240]  resist and say no non-compliance non-compliance non-compliance a little more than 20 years ago
[2:44:00.240 --> 2:44:07.520]  japanese scientists discovered and were able to isolate a compound that is naturally in nature

[2:47:05.440 --> 2:47:28.320]  all right i've got i didn't know this but now just famed famed emmy robin here
[2:47:29.040 --> 2:47:33.200]  doula because she does natural pregnancies i'm actually stunned i'm learning a lot of
[2:47:33.200 --> 2:47:38.880]  things in the brakes here but i guess i shouldn't be so shocked because having a natural pregnancy
[2:47:38.880 --> 2:47:43.600]  is now considered like impossible i guess even though it's the natural thing it should be normal
[2:47:43.600 --> 2:47:48.160]  but we'll get into that but here's i want to preface that with this from the cnn article with
[2:47:48.160 --> 2:47:53.600]  the headline uh demonizing natural birth here and this this is really what it comes down to
[2:47:54.720 --> 2:47:57.760]  and when you understand this you understand what the new world order is really about
[2:47:57.760 --> 2:48:04.640]  from the cnn article headline it's bad to say breastfeeding is natural according to a pair
[2:48:04.640 --> 2:48:10.480]  of experts this type of campaign could backfire in a big way when federal and local health departments
[2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:17.360]  use the term natural to promote breastfeeding even though that's the truth it could i'm adding that
[2:48:17.360 --> 2:48:23.840]  it could inadvertently fuel concerns over other aspects of health and society that are seen as
[2:48:23.840 --> 2:48:29.440]  unnatural no not seen as unnatural are unnatural this is the propaganda this is how they slither
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:38.640]  and snake their way in such as vaccines oh genetically modified foods ah and assisted
[2:48:38.640 --> 2:48:46.560]  reproductive technologies ah ha so see this is really an amazing phenomenon here where they take
[2:48:46.560 --> 2:48:51.920]  things that are unnatural hey doesn't mean i'm demonizing it necessarily it just means it's
[2:48:51.920 --> 2:48:59.040]  not natural and they say oh don't say unnatural that's a way of demonizing things that are unnatural
[2:48:59.040 --> 2:49:04.000]  and it's like well that's the point so they're obviously in defense of this because they know
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:08.320]  it's not natural and they don't want you to know the vaccines aren't natural they don't want you to
[2:49:08.320 --> 2:49:12.880]  know that all these assisted birth things are not natural they don't want you to know that your food
[2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:17.440]  is not natural and oh my gosh if you realize that none of this is natural you'll start to question
[2:49:17.440 --> 2:49:21.440]  the reality that they're in control of and then you might break out of the matrix and take the
[2:49:21.440 --> 2:49:26.000]  red pill and defeat the paradigm of global government we can't have that we're cnn we hate you
[2:49:26.720 --> 2:49:32.240]  and so so you're famous now apparently these hospitals because you're having women giving
[2:49:32.240 --> 2:49:40.800]  natural birth is it really that rare i mean i wouldn't say like rare but i do know that i mean
[2:49:40.800 --> 2:49:48.640]  let's just for example a week ago i did a birth in a hospital and it was it was a v-back is what
[2:49:48.640 --> 2:49:52.800]  they call it a vaginal birth after a cesarean right so she had a c-section the first time around
[2:49:52.800 --> 2:49:58.080]  because of she got to the hospital and the doctor started and you weren't there i wasn't there this
[2:49:58.080 --> 2:50:02.400]  was you know two years ago and the stock doctor started doing what they like to do and all the
[2:50:02.400 --> 2:50:07.680]  different you know looking for that cash your water give you some pitosa and give you an epidural
[2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:13.760]  right so she ended up in a c-section and so she we went over her birth plan time and time again we
[2:50:13.760 --> 2:50:17.280]  would go on walks together and she would tell me this is what i want this is what i want
[2:50:17.280 --> 2:50:23.920]  and i'm like okay we're gonna do this right so we went and and having a v-back in a hospital
[2:50:23.920 --> 2:50:29.600]  they they look at it as like a it's a very medically like crazy thing like oh my gosh
[2:50:29.600 --> 2:50:35.440]  you're gonna do it that way when you know it's like because we have this science it's better
[2:50:35.440 --> 2:50:42.160]  no right right so um and this is not the first v-back that i have done 100 natural in a hospital
[2:50:42.160 --> 2:50:47.840]  so i i pride myself and so they even have new this before so they have new terms pregnancy
[2:50:47.840 --> 2:50:52.640]  or giving birth is just from its vaginal birth that's giving birth but now it's oh it's a v-back
[2:50:52.640 --> 2:50:58.320]  birth right so it's a v-back to add that little asterisk like oh v-back makes you high risk so
[2:50:58.320 --> 2:51:03.280]  you can't do it at a birth center and some oh high risk yes but chopping a hole into your stomach
[2:51:03.280 --> 2:51:07.600]  is fine right and it just depends on like why did you have the c-section in the first place right so
[2:51:07.600 --> 2:51:13.280]  her c-section in the first place wasn't because of factors that she would need to have a repeat
[2:51:13.280 --> 2:51:21.280]  c-section her hers was because the doctor intervened and caused a cascading issue with the baby right
[2:51:21.280 --> 2:51:26.640]  so they had to cut the baby out so her body knew what to naturally do and i knew it and just to
[2:51:26.640 --> 2:51:30.800]  pause right there my guess is i'm assuming that she was on her back during the botched pregnancy
[2:51:31.520 --> 2:51:36.720]  which is the unnatural way to give birth she was well once you get once you get an epidural
[2:51:36.720 --> 2:51:41.520]  you can't get up and walk around right your legs are numb they will turn you on your side and they'll
[2:51:41.520 --> 2:51:45.440]  usually put a peanut ball between your legs because they don't they don't want you to just
[2:51:45.440 --> 2:51:49.600]  lay on your back be stuck on your back so they will they will turn you on your side in the hospital
[2:51:49.600 --> 2:51:53.760]  once you get an epidural and then they'll come and they'll try to switch it's like takes a couple
[2:51:53.760 --> 2:51:57.840]  people to switch which is just like a whole another thing of the unnatural birth position they put
[2:51:57.840 --> 2:52:03.040]  you on you got to get a catheter all the things happen when you get an epidural right so i'm the
[2:52:03.040 --> 2:52:07.360]  old fashioned way i'll just take the woman and just shake her from the arms until the baby falls
[2:52:07.360 --> 2:52:14.160]  out you know i mean probably better yeah i mean i was i was so proud of this woman you know she
[2:52:14.160 --> 2:52:19.120]  she did it she did it we didn't do any drugs she had the when you get to the hospital the first thing
[2:52:19.120 --> 2:52:24.320]  that happens is they put an ivy port in your hand and this is just in case in case in case
[2:52:24.320 --> 2:52:29.680]  they need to use it in case of emergencies right so that's going to take you out of this oxytocin
[2:52:29.680 --> 2:52:34.080]  releasing thing when you're having to get an ivy put in when you're having to sign away all these
[2:52:34.720 --> 2:52:39.600]  immediately the natural functions of your body's chemistry are just being manipulated and changed
[2:52:39.600 --> 2:52:44.080]  the lights are bright everything and then it's like and then your natural chemistry starts to go
[2:52:44.080 --> 2:52:48.800]  into like the fight or flight emergency response mode yeah who what what are you going to tell me
[2:52:48.800 --> 2:52:54.160]  to do and now your baby is getting all of those chemicals it shouldn't be getting truth truth this
[2:52:54.160 --> 2:53:01.040]  is this true um and and i was so so proud of my client she had this baby all natural that night
[2:53:01.040 --> 2:53:07.280]  in question we had to stay in triage for three hours i've never had that before we got to the
[2:53:07.280 --> 2:53:13.440]  hospital at midnight and they kept us in triage a because my client didn't want to get a cervical
[2:53:13.440 --> 2:53:18.640]  check but she was clearly in labor her water broke right there so it was like oh you're gonna get us
[2:53:18.640 --> 2:53:23.120]  into a put you're gonna get us into a labor and delivery room um but i told her i said you know
[2:53:23.120 --> 2:53:27.520]  what i was like don't allow this to cause fear that they're keeping you in here and they're telling
[2:53:27.520 --> 2:53:32.240]  you that they don't have any lnd rooms available like that blows my mind we don't have any labor
[2:53:32.240 --> 2:53:37.600]  and delivery rooms available the doctor told us that it was the busiest night that she's had in
[2:53:37.600 --> 2:53:43.200]  almost 30 years that she's worked there and i'm like i get it pandemic babies people were cooped
[2:53:43.200 --> 2:53:46.720]  up right so what are they gonna do i don't even think that's the case my guess is that
[2:53:46.720 --> 2:53:50.480]  understaffed that's what it is it's understaffed and they're covering it up with all these different
[2:53:50.480 --> 2:53:55.360]  narratives yeah 100 understaffed i've never walked through an lnd hall and and not been able to find
[2:53:55.360 --> 2:53:59.760]  a nurse like i did that night i it took me a while to walk around be like hey my clients it's like a
[2:53:59.760 --> 2:54:03.120]  ghost town and they said oh the hospital is so overwhelmed you walked through and nobody's there
[2:54:03.120 --> 2:54:11.040]  it was i had to in that night in question i also had to walk through emergency to get to the back
[2:54:11.040 --> 2:54:16.480]  at the hospital it's like i literally had to just like walk through this maze to get probably eerie
[2:54:16.480 --> 2:54:21.840]  it was scary i look back and i'm like i should have videoed this because it was it was creepy don't
[2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:26.320]  don't say that alex she'll video next time all right relax alex if you're listening it's okay
[2:54:26.320 --> 2:54:30.640]  she didn't know but it was just i mean i mean like because it was just more like it was just it was
[2:54:30.640 --> 2:54:36.800]  kind of scary for me i'm like this is weird like i wasn't nobody i was passing nobody in the halls
[2:54:36.800 --> 2:54:41.760]  and um you know i get to lnd and i find out i'm like my client's still in triage and i met her
[2:54:41.760 --> 2:54:47.680]  there i went home and breastfed my kid because i was like i need to drain myself before i have a
[2:54:47.680 --> 2:54:52.080]  long night ahead i have my pump with me but you know i'm going to go home i'm going to breastfeed
[2:54:52.080 --> 2:54:55.920]  i was like i'm going to meet you at the hospital i'll be there in like 30 minutes and i get there
[2:54:55.920 --> 2:54:59.520]  and i'm thinking that'll be enough time for them to put the ivy in her and get her moved over to
[2:54:59.520 --> 2:55:04.400]  labor and delivery nope they kept her in triage we were kept in triage for three hours because we
[2:55:04.400 --> 2:55:10.800]  didn't have an open lnd room we get to lnd and we didn't even see the doctor until my client was
[2:55:10.800 --> 2:55:17.360]  pushing so it was like the doctor was in a c-section okay an hour later can we see the doctor the
[2:55:17.360 --> 2:55:21.680]  doctor's in a c-section i'm like another c-section and is that procedure for a c-section a little
[2:55:21.680 --> 2:55:26.880]  more like a little more hands-on and lengthy for the doctor uh i think it's a little quicker for
[2:55:26.880 --> 2:55:32.160]  them a little quicker okay and then to wait for a woman to push a baby out of a canal sometimes a
[2:55:32.160 --> 2:55:37.920]  first time mom it can take you know two hours to push a baby out so the doctor's sitting there for
[2:55:37.920 --> 2:55:43.520]  two hours and it's kind of like okay i'm gonna go over here i'm gonna come back my nurses will let
[2:55:43.520 --> 2:55:47.360]  me know and you know so so that could be an element too of oh it's more convenient for me as a doctor
[2:55:47.360 --> 2:55:51.440]  to just cut the stomach open and take it out and that's the documentary the business of being born
[2:55:51.440 --> 2:55:56.320]  right got you so uh no concern for the baby or the mother just say you know it's uh it's more
[2:55:56.320 --> 2:56:02.560]  convenient just hack her up yeah it yeah i mean it's it's it's crazy it's a crazy world out there
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:07.120]  but you know my client after talking to her when she was in postpartum it's like
[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:14.560]  that night there was 11 verse there was 80 of them were c-sections and it it used to it
[2:56:14.560 --> 2:56:20.400]  that's wild it grew to 30 one in three women right 30 c-section and right now in america
[2:56:20.400 --> 2:56:27.120]  it's 30 in some places like you know california it's a little higher right it's it's a little more
[2:56:28.160 --> 2:56:33.840]  i guess desired to have yeah the c-section is woke man yeah i mean look i am an advocate
[2:56:33.840 --> 2:56:38.640]  for women who need it right i will be there for you if you have a if you have if you have to have
[2:56:38.640 --> 2:56:42.960]  a gentle c-section or a planned c-section you can also hire a doula there are doulas that
[2:56:42.960 --> 2:56:47.680]  that will come and and we will be there with you because it's scary that's really scary and i'm
[2:56:47.680 --> 2:56:53.760]  all about it if that's what you need right but the body if it's your first baby and you don't
[2:56:53.760 --> 2:56:59.120]  have you're not high risk you don't have preeclampsia you don't you know you you are a healthy woman
[2:56:59.120 --> 2:57:06.720]  able to give birth see this gets back this gets back to the this gets back to the argument that
[2:57:06.720 --> 2:57:10.320]  i want to finish up we have a five minute segment coming up just just finish up in this next five
[2:57:10.320 --> 2:57:15.440]  minute segment because this gets back into the argument of natural versus the unnatural and how
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:20.720]  the unnatural is overriding the health care industry and it's because it's the same dynamic
[2:57:20.720 --> 2:57:27.520]  with vaccines it's like hey my my neighbor my neighbor's kid has chickenpox i'll send my kid
[2:57:27.520 --> 2:57:31.200]  over there they'll get chickenpox they'll recover in a week or two they'll be they'll be fine they'll
[2:57:31.200 --> 2:57:36.000]  be fine they'll have immunity same with coven oh i i i guess i've had coven i don't even know but
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:40.160]  i've been around all these coven people had one staying with me never got sick because i have
[2:57:40.160 --> 2:57:44.800]  natural immunity but they want to overwrite all of that overwrite the natural immunity overwrite
[2:57:44.800 --> 2:57:51.200]  the birthing process so the medical industry can control it i have the greatest sense of loss
[2:57:51.840 --> 2:57:57.200]  deep in my heart deep in my soul i've ever had in my 47 years on this planet i've had a lot of
[2:57:57.200 --> 2:58:08.400]  loss everybody else has and it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people
[2:58:08.400 --> 2:58:15.040]  fought and died and bled and sweat for and now we're just throwing it all away
[2:58:16.720 --> 2:58:21.440]  and i see the general public in a medically induced scientifically induced behavioral
[2:58:21.440 --> 2:58:28.560]  psychologically controlled tranchi and i know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder
[2:58:28.560 --> 2:58:35.120]  and it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and then growth and then
[2:58:35.920 --> 2:58:41.280]  falling apart and then degenerating collapsing and then coming back to life again it's just the
[2:58:41.280 --> 2:58:45.840]  globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse
[2:58:45.840 --> 2:58:52.320]  to actually end the species as we know it people ask me all the time alex the last three months or
[2:58:52.320 --> 2:58:58.160]  so you've had explosive energy on top of your already very intense level of energy what's
[2:58:58.160 --> 2:59:01.920]  happening well it's the things that are happening in the world right now that's got my blood up but
[2:59:01.920 --> 2:59:08.240]  also i've gotten back in the groove of religiously taking three products every single day dna force
[2:59:08.240 --> 2:59:14.880]  plus it's back in stock also x2 deep-growth crystal iodine that's essential for your immune
[2:59:14.880 --> 2:59:20.960]  system your whole body and of course at nighttime down and out sleep aid that makes me have deeper
[2:59:20.960 --> 2:59:26.240]  cleaner restful sleep that again boosts my immune system and is good for every cell in my body and
[2:59:26.240 --> 2:59:31.440]  great for the spirit all three of these products are in stock right now they are 40 off of the case
[2:59:31.440 --> 2:59:38.480]  of dna force plus and 50 off for one week only on survival shield x2 and yes until supplies last
[2:59:38.480 --> 2:59:44.880]  we have down and out 50 off and in forward store dot com this is their trifecta i suggest you check
[2:59:44.880 --> 2:59:55.040]  it out and experience what this does for your body today you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:02.240 --> 3:00:06.720]  all right last segment here i'm i'm i'm learning so much even in the breaks with emmy robin here
[3:00:06.720 --> 3:00:13.440]  and uh but but here here here's the final point and look i'm a free market capitalist okay i'm
[3:00:13.440 --> 3:00:23.840]  not hedging there but there is a there is a numbing greed that exists in capitalism it's true there
[3:00:23.840 --> 3:00:30.960]  is a there is a numbing inhumane greed that comes with capitalism and because of that you see these
[3:00:30.960 --> 3:00:37.120]  unnatural things completely overriding the natural things because there's money involved and there's
[3:00:37.120 --> 3:00:40.880]  all different aspects of this whether it's the breast milk versus the formula the c-section
[3:00:40.880 --> 3:00:48.480]  versus the natural birth vaccines versus natural immunity it's it's putting profit over people
[3:00:48.480 --> 3:00:52.160]  so again i'm not an anti-capitalist i'm all about free market capitalism but but we need
[3:00:52.160 --> 3:00:56.000]  to make sure we stay human and grounded in it because that's where it runs into problems and so
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:00:59.840]  the leftist is like oh let's just go into full communism and then you'll just be starving to death
[3:00:59.840 --> 3:01:05.760]  uh versus hey we'll have capitalism but let's keep let's keep people over profit and so just
[3:01:05.760 --> 3:01:09.120]  in the brief five minutes whether you want to talk about the the breast milk or all this other
[3:01:09.120 --> 3:01:15.680]  stuff talk about natural stuff versus the medical industry wanting to overwrite all the natural
[3:01:15.680 --> 3:01:21.200]  things so that they can turn a profit at every different corner of this process look it starts
[3:01:21.200 --> 3:01:26.240]  with education educate yourself find a good childbirth education if you're pregnant if you plan on
[3:01:26.240 --> 3:01:30.880]  having a baby no matter how you plan on having the baby right so i'll start with that secondly
[3:01:32.160 --> 3:01:37.840]  i am educated in in breastfeeding i'm a breastfeeding counselor i i know the positive
[3:01:37.840 --> 3:01:44.400]  benefits of breast milk i was telling you on the on the break that you know the the baby's saliva
[3:01:44.400 --> 3:01:50.160]  the second it hits the woman's nipple will go into the breast ducts or the milk ducts and it will
[3:01:50.160 --> 3:01:56.480]  tell the breast milk what antibodies to create for them so if this baby comes in contact with
[3:01:56.480 --> 3:02:02.800]  grandma who has a cold or covid right and the baby's exposed to it all of a sudden and it's
[3:02:02.800 --> 3:02:08.320]  breastfeeding on the mother the milk that the mother is providing for that baby is going to
[3:02:08.320 --> 3:02:15.920]  create antibodies to protect it right they they i hate saying they according to nih website right
[3:02:15.920 --> 3:02:20.560]  they're talking about the covid vaccine it's creating antibodies in the breast milk right
[3:02:20.560 --> 3:02:26.000]  well it does it naturally too when you get exposed to the virus if the mother has covid if the mother
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:30.000]  has covid before she's pregnant if the mother has covid when she's pregnant the color mother gets
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:36.400]  but wait a second if the mother is giving the baby natural immunity then fizer can't make billions
[3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:41.360]  of dollars how dare you well i mean i'm not a virologist i'm not an immunologist i can't really
[3:02:41.360 --> 3:02:46.080]  speak to the vaccine but what i can say is the vaccine has only really been given to pregnant
[3:02:46.080 --> 3:02:51.280]  breastfeeding women since june and it's october so we got five months here right five months
[3:02:51.280 --> 3:02:58.400]  that they've been doing this how is it that these ob gyns have now they're not just suggesting it
[3:02:58.400 --> 3:03:03.280]  like the flu vaccine when you're pregnant has always just kind of been suggested right like
[3:03:03.280 --> 3:03:09.520]  heavily suggested but suggested like you should get the flu vaccine this covid vaccine is it i
[3:03:09.520 --> 3:03:15.360]  have women who are scared out of their minds because they are being so bullied right yeah i mean for
[3:03:15.360 --> 3:03:20.160]  many places you can't even go into the hospital without it yeah well just know moms out there i
[3:03:20.160 --> 3:03:26.000]  want to tell you like i'm not telling anybody to do anything or don't do anything what i am educated
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:30.720]  in is that skin to skin after birth and what it's going to do to benefit baby that delaying
[3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:36.400]  cord clamping what it's going to do to baby and breastfeeding that baby and how all three of those
[3:03:36.400 --> 3:03:42.880]  things are going to protect your baby from multiple viruses not just covid right and that's how it's
[3:03:42.880 --> 3:03:48.480]  been for however long we've been here this is why we're here this is why we've survived this long
[3:03:48.480 --> 3:03:53.920]  right nature knows what it's doing nature knows well and so that that's that that's the big takeaway
[3:03:53.920 --> 3:03:59.680]  here this is a microcosm of the bigger picture but this is a good kind of microscopic zoom in on
[3:03:59.680 --> 3:04:04.640]  the larger issue and you can say it's intentional you can say it's unintentional you can blame this
[3:04:04.640 --> 3:04:11.280]  you can blame that this is what's happening there is a overwrite of natural humanity there is an
[3:04:11.280 --> 3:04:16.960]  overwrite of natural humanity by government by corporations by all of it in hospitals and
[3:04:16.960 --> 3:04:22.720]  everything they want to overwrite humans natural ability to live in function so that around every
[3:04:22.720 --> 3:04:28.960]  corner around every cough around every broken toenail around every sniffle you're paying somebody
[3:04:28.960 --> 3:04:34.160]  and you're enslaved instead of having the natural ability to survive like humans have had for millions
[3:04:34.160 --> 3:04:39.360]  or billions of hire-along years that we've been on this planet that's the big takeaway the corporate
[3:04:39.360 --> 3:04:45.680]  world government wants to overwrite human nature final comment emi that they're finding antibodies
[3:04:45.680 --> 3:04:51.280]  in breastinal 10 months later 10 months later in in breastfeeding women dr. rebecca pal mount
[3:04:51.280 --> 3:04:57.760]  science where can people follow you for more info um my website emi robindula.com 2m's 2b's
[3:04:58.720 --> 3:05:03.360]  perfect right and in addition we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary
[3:05:03.360 --> 3:05:08.880]  systems of these employees because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical energy
[3:05:08.880 --> 3:05:13.200]  during your work during your tasks whatever it might be um you're really stressing the
[3:05:13.200 --> 3:05:17.920]  cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you breathe you have to forcibly inhale
[3:05:17.920 --> 3:05:24.240]  and forcibly exhale that taxes the heart it taxes the lungs and we have given people heart attacks
[3:05:24.240 --> 3:05:30.640]  by allowing them to work with their mouth and nose covered with absolutely no regulation
[3:05:30.640 --> 3:05:36.400]  no oversight no medical oversight the globalists have told us we're a disease they've told us
[3:05:36.400 --> 3:05:40.720]  they want to eradicate us and all the studies show that when you wear these masks it lowers
[3:05:40.720 --> 3:05:46.800]  your oxygen level up to one third and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning
[3:05:46.800 --> 3:05:50.960]  this is a sick cult and we've got to say no but the only way the real science because
[3:05:50.960 --> 3:05:56.720]  out of the public is if we tell them get your copy today of covenland and expose them it's
[3:05:56.720 --> 3:06:12.640]  covenland.com go there now
[3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:24.960]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones and now your host

[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:09.440]  trouble funding itself is not the fault of our amazing listeners and supporters it is the fault
[3:18:09.440 --> 3:18:14.320]  of the globalist when we can get enough of our great supplements other products in we're able
[3:18:14.320 --> 3:18:18.720]  to sell enough of it to stay on air and quite frankly even expand and to face the new world
[3:18:18.720 --> 3:18:23.840]  order but because of the supply chain breakdowns that were very easy to predict the global lockdowns
[3:18:23.840 --> 3:18:28.400]  were designed to do that we have had real problems getting our best selling products in some of them
[3:18:28.400 --> 3:18:33.440]  take up to 10 months to get in we've had to discontinue some of our products because we just
[3:18:33.440 --> 3:18:39.120]  can't get the ingredients anymore it's pretty scary stuff so please take advantage of sales

[3:18:59.280 --> 3:19:04.480]  the average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between
[3:19:04.480 --> 3:19:10.400]  free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other who are literally
[3:19:10.400 --> 3:19:15.600]  trying to create a post-human world for the united states of brazil and of course triggered by the
[3:19:15.600 --> 3:19:21.200]  brakes in the uk nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government that's
[3:19:21.200 --> 3:19:27.200]  why they launched their great recess and their program after collapsing us of build back better
[3:19:28.160 --> 3:19:34.400]  this is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy and because
[3:19:34.400 --> 3:19:38.720]  they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow because the left which is the
[3:19:38.720 --> 3:19:45.200]  ideology of this world government system couldn't win they released a biological weapon on us now
[3:19:45.200 --> 3:19:50.480]  we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago it's that simple they can't maybe
[3:19:50.480 --> 3:19:55.760]  it's because of our free speech and our guns so the global corporate combine released cover 19
[3:19:55.760 --> 3:19:58.800]  and you know the rest is history expose this paradigm and we win
[3:19:58.800 --> 3:20:14.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[3:37:35.600 --> 3:37:44.160]  healing never existed in in in since the beginning of time the god is science nature is don't you
[3:37:44.160 --> 3:37:55.440]  talk about nature is not god only science is god there were some wild scenes in some shops and bars
[3:37:56.160 --> 3:38:01.120]  as sydney siders rushed to enjoy freedoms denied for months
[3:38:01.120 --> 3:38:15.280]  yep but as the lockdown ends the lockout of the unvaccinated comes into place
[3:38:16.480 --> 3:38:21.920]  with only the double jabbed able to enjoy the reopening
[3:38:21.920 --> 3:38:31.440]  this is from the daily this is from australia that's the language they use
[3:38:33.920 --> 3:38:35.840]  this is satanic demonic
[3:38:38.640 --> 3:38:42.640]  showed that thing about herd immunity we're doing a story in this week's trends journal
[3:38:43.520 --> 3:38:47.440]  they know they're going to show that i'm just we're just working on it last weeks by the way
[3:38:47.440 --> 3:38:55.920]  176 pages no ads there's no magazine in the world like it it's a book each week and you read what
[3:38:55.920 --> 3:39:00.800]  you want when you pick up a newspaper you don't read everything you read what you want pick up a
[3:39:00.800 --> 3:39:06.160]  magazine the same thing but information you won't find anywhere else because we give trend posts
[3:39:06.160 --> 3:39:11.280]  trend forecasts what it means what's next and what you might want to do about it
[3:39:11.280 --> 3:39:19.680]  so there's trend entrepreneur opportunities herd immunity heresy lies and damn lies
[3:39:21.040 --> 3:39:24.640]  we're talking about herd immunity how they say it then they say they're not going to get it
[3:39:25.360 --> 3:39:29.920]  and they go more and more it seems that the experts are giving up the idea of herd immunity and
[3:39:29.920 --> 3:39:35.840]  perhaps with good reason dr andrew pollard had the oxford vaccine group was quoted on an mbc
[3:39:35.840 --> 3:39:43.200]  cnbc telling british lawmakers that with vaccines not offering complete protection vaccinated persons
[3:39:44.320 --> 3:39:51.680]  still able to be infected and transmitted the virus that the idea of herd immunity was mythical
[3:39:53.440 --> 3:39:59.840]  i suspected what the virus will throw up next is a variant even better at transmitting among
[3:39:59.840 --> 3:40:07.600]  vaccinated populations in the uk israel and elsewhere the notion of vaccination and conferred
[3:40:07.600 --> 3:40:17.280]  immunity was proven false studies show that those with natural immunity were far better protected
[3:40:18.080 --> 3:40:24.400]  than those vaccinated and when our article was a pandemic of the unvaccinated or just the opposite
[3:40:24.400 --> 3:40:32.000]  it that was september this year dr andrew freedman of the cardiff medical school said that because
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:36.240]  of the more transmissible nature of the delta variant the proportion of people needing to
[3:40:36.240 --> 3:40:42.160]  be fully vaccinated for herd immunity is probably not achievable we're mentioning this because
[3:40:45.760 --> 3:40:47.680]  why are you forcing people to get vaccinated
[3:40:47.680 --> 3:40:56.880]  number one the vaccination of efficacy rate went down from 96 percent according to when they were
[3:40:56.880 --> 3:41:03.440]  selling it back in november and december 2020 to now 39 percent according to the israeli health
[3:41:03.440 --> 3:41:11.520]  ministry so why are you doing this and then we quote that fraud fouchy over there they show
[3:41:11.520 --> 3:41:17.440]  that picture that cuts on over there and we write dr anthony frouchy for example ordained
[3:41:17.440 --> 3:41:24.080]  by the prostitutes as the greatest epidemiologist in the world is ever known first bs that herd
[3:41:24.080 --> 3:41:29.360]  immunity from covet 19 would be reached in the us when 70 percent of the population have been
[3:41:29.360 --> 3:41:38.320]  vaccinated but then he adjusted his estimate first to 75 percent 80 percent and then 85 percent
[3:41:38.320 --> 3:41:44.640]  and again this is what we do with the transjournal see fouchy the fake the root of all pandemic
[3:41:44.640 --> 3:41:56.480]  lies march 2021 kit yate of the uk's beth university said herd immunity would be impossible with less
[3:41:56.480 --> 3:42:02.320]  than 90 percent of the population getting vaccinated but that was before the delta variant
[3:42:03.840 --> 3:42:10.960]  again on and on we put the facts down you're lying to us you're making us crap up
[3:42:10.960 --> 3:42:17.600]  remember when they were telling you to don't every time you touch the surface to wipe it down
[3:42:18.960 --> 3:42:24.320]  and wipe your hands the chances of picking the virus up from the surface
[3:42:26.480 --> 3:42:28.400]  were greater than 1001
[3:42:32.160 --> 3:42:38.400]  there's a lot going on when we get back i'm going to talk about the economy because today's market
[3:42:38.400 --> 3:42:47.520]  is very important what's going on what to do and what to expect the markets are up strong today
[3:42:49.120 --> 3:42:55.440]  and when i went on the air it was going down down and down they're going to go we're going to be

[3:43:20.880 --> 3:43:27.120]  by the sun god tagaloa who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe
[3:43:27.120 --> 3:43:32.720]  the simoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a

[3:45:04.400 --> 3:45:09.440]  global enslavement and in that documentary i predicted the globalist would establish world
[3:45:09.440 --> 3:45:15.200]  government are releasing a virus demanding that they're being worldwide lockdowns and
[3:45:15.200 --> 3:45:20.400]  then triggering a collapse of our industrial society and now they've done it how did i know
[3:45:20.400 --> 3:45:25.520]  they would do it because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and
[3:45:25.520 --> 3:45:30.240]  internal meetings were leaked you see then i was tracking the builder bird group who's head at the
[3:45:30.240 --> 3:45:35.520]  time was claus schwa and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were at deep planning
[3:45:35.520 --> 3:45:41.200]  to launch this great reset well we're now living in the purposeful collapse of the third world and
[3:45:41.200 --> 3:45:46.320]  the first world known as ash is a tyrannical corporate world government the total censorship
[3:45:46.320 --> 3:45:52.640]  no due process destruction of the family and then incrementally more and more deadly injections
[3:45:52.640 --> 3:45:57.920]  of poison mass creating these vaccines to poison us and depopulate us this is what info wars is
[3:45:57.920 --> 3:46:04.560]  fighting we're fighting for the future i want to be very clear the fact that info wars is having
[3:46:04.560 --> 3:46:10.000]  trouble funding itself is not the fault of our amazing listeners and supporters it is the fault
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:14.800]  of the globalists when we can get enough of our great supplements other products in we're able
[3:46:14.800 --> 3:46:19.280]  to sell enough of it to stay on air and quite frankly even expand in the face of the new world
[3:46:19.280 --> 3:46:23.520]  order but because of the supply chain breakdowns that were very easy to predict for the global
[3:46:23.520 --> 3:46:28.560]  lockdowns they're designed to do that we have had real problems getting our best selling products in
[3:46:28.560 --> 3:46:33.280]  some of them take up to 10 months to get in we've had to discontinue some of our products because we

[3:47:51.520 --> 3:48:03.280]  to talk about the economy this morning the dow was up over 170 points it didn't 180 now it's down
[3:48:03.280 --> 3:48:10.560]  about 180 points oil is touching 84 dollars a barrel for brent crude
[3:48:10.560 --> 3:48:18.560]  you saw the job numbers last week they expected
[3:48:21.840 --> 3:48:32.800]  the numbers were between 700 000 and 500 000 new jobs to be created the number came in at 194 000
[3:48:32.800 --> 3:48:38.320]  this is serious
[3:48:41.440 --> 3:48:44.320]  look at the facts meantime
[3:48:46.960 --> 3:48:54.160]  they're wondering and worrying about stagflation meaning inflation prices go up
[3:48:54.160 --> 3:49:04.000]  and the economy stagnates it's not stagflation it's dragflation the economy is going to go
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:09.920]  down drag down and inflation is going to go much higher
[3:49:14.080 --> 3:49:16.240]  you look at just some of the things coming out
[3:49:16.240 --> 3:49:26.960]  pepsico will continue to pass on higher cost to consumers with price increases this fall
[3:49:27.680 --> 3:49:33.120]  and early next year and it's one place after another they're doing it
[3:49:36.240 --> 3:49:40.480]  meantime merger and acquisition activities at all time highs
[3:49:40.480 --> 3:49:48.720]  U.K. grocery fetches 9.4 billion i mean it's one story after another every day in the news
[3:49:49.520 --> 3:49:55.440]  the big's buying up more and more and getting bigger while everybody else gets poorer
[3:49:57.520 --> 3:50:02.080]  and then you keep looking at the other data
[3:50:02.080 --> 3:50:13.840]  again bank mergers keep going up Moderna vaccine mints three new Forbes billionaires
[3:50:14.720 --> 3:50:21.360]  the financial windfall at Moderna the biotech company behind one of the three federally
[3:50:21.360 --> 3:50:29.120]  cleared COVID-19 vaccines has propelled three new names into Forbes magazine's list
[3:50:29.120 --> 3:50:34.720]  of the 400 richest people in the United States and the richest people in the United States these
[3:50:34.720 --> 3:50:42.400]  400 pay less percentage of taxes than we the little people of slave landia you keep looking at
[3:50:43.040 --> 3:50:48.560]  the numbers and you can see what's going on
[3:50:48.560 --> 3:50:59.680]  inflation is going to keep going up the economy is going to keep going down
[3:51:00.640 --> 3:51:06.880]  you're looking at bitcoin if bitcoin and the other top cryptocurrencies weren't here
[3:51:07.440 --> 3:51:13.680]  gold prices would be spiking we have called the breakout points of crypto of bitcoin
[3:51:13.680 --> 3:51:21.120]  to the last three years identically and now it's at a critical breakout point
[3:51:23.920 --> 3:51:34.160]  once it breaks above the 63 65000 mark we even stays above this where it is now in the 57000
[3:51:35.600 --> 3:51:37.600]  almost 58000 per coin
[3:51:37.600 --> 3:51:45.360]  if it keeps staying in this range we're looking for a big breakout
[3:51:46.880 --> 3:51:50.560]  the only thing that could turn it back as we see it
[3:51:52.640 --> 3:51:58.640]  is government interference and will the government interfere of course they will
[3:52:00.960 --> 3:52:05.760]  my father may rest in peace used to tell me about my grandfather may he rest in peace may
[3:52:05.760 --> 3:52:12.080]  all rest in peace about how he packed up all his gold coins and brought them back to the bank
[3:52:13.040 --> 3:52:14.480]  back in 1933
[3:52:17.680 --> 3:52:19.600]  when it was illegal to own gold
[3:52:24.400 --> 3:52:26.480]  it's a gangster mob in charge
[3:52:26.480 --> 3:52:37.920]  I'm not making it up there's a story here in the financial times about
[3:52:41.680 --> 3:52:43.920]  the dirty deals the banksters are doing
[3:52:46.640 --> 3:52:47.520]  and how the gang
[3:52:47.520 --> 3:52:54.560]  pressure bills for fed to crack down on active trading by staff
[3:52:55.520 --> 3:53:01.440]  us central bank warned tighter ethics regime needed to restore reputation
[3:53:02.880 --> 3:53:08.320]  faced with one of the biggest reputational crisis in its history the federal reserve is
[3:53:08.320 --> 3:53:13.920]  under pressure to overhaul its ethic guidelines and eliminate virtually all active trading by
[3:53:13.920 --> 3:53:21.040]  US central bank officials and what happened was
[3:53:24.000 --> 3:53:29.600]  two regional Fed presidents Robert Kaplan from Dallas and Eric Rosengren from Boston
[3:53:30.160 --> 3:53:32.960]  resigned after their trading activity came to light
