[00:40.760 --> 00:45.960]  that it's actually a pagan symbol though beautiful and expropriated that's fine with me
[00:47.240 --> 00:53.000]  and now they're declaring you criticize any of our agenda period whether it's turning your guns in

[01:12.280 --> 01:18.840]  the show basically we can't see the show going on the statements up on info wars.com they said we
[01:18.840 --> 01:29.320]  can't see our family going forward with the show like there's the quote we cannot imagine the show
[01:29.320 --> 01:35.400]  without Phil Robertson so boom that's the only action they could take and they should go off and
[01:35.400 --> 01:41.000]  start their own cable channel guaranteed their business people their capitalist their Americana
[01:41.800 --> 01:49.480]  and this is I mean who watches A&E A&E has very low ratings outside of a few shows and of course
[01:49.480 --> 01:55.720]  Disney owns A&E so I called for a boycott yesterday amongst everyone else about the same time there's
[01:55.720 --> 02:02.040]  a facebook page with a million likes right now but they may try to censor that I should have thought
[02:02.040 --> 02:07.320]  of this we're going to launch right now Paul Watson as we speak is creating a facebook that
[02:07.320 --> 02:13.160]  will post on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com that you can make go mega viral let's get it with
[02:13.160 --> 02:19.560]  five million likes so that people get real hardcore info instead of a debate about homosexuality not
[02:19.560 --> 02:24.920]  homosexuality they want to make it about that to make it about civil rights for folks that already
[02:24.920 --> 02:32.360]  have them this is about being tolerant of other people's views that you don't agree with if you're
[02:32.360 --> 02:38.360]  a gay activist or whatever and that's what Camille Paglia who came out about her sexual
[02:39.480 --> 02:45.480]  proclivity when it wasn't cool when when there was pressure and she said this is a Soviet
[02:45.480 --> 02:51.880]  Stalinist style operation and that is exactly what I called it yesterday this is Stalinist
[02:51.880 --> 02:57.720]  showing she's smart in his done her historical research this is Stalinist Paglia duck dynasty
[02:57.720 --> 03:04.600]  uproar utterly fascist utterly Stalinist boom it's both fascist and communist both of them did this
[03:04.600 --> 03:09.160]  and folks if they can pull Christmas trees down and activity scenes all over the country and at
[03:09.160 --> 03:17.000]  military bases and crosses that have been there in some cases a thousand years in Europe if they
[03:17.000 --> 03:24.840]  can do that they can do anything ladies and gentlemen so our our facebook is going to be
[03:24.840 --> 03:31.240]  important because it's going to point out the larger deeper agenda and Paul Watson is creating it
[03:31.240 --> 03:37.720]  right now in the next 20 minutes it'll be up on info wars dot com and then you can add your
[03:37.720 --> 03:42.920]  comments your analysis your points so it's going to go live it'll be on we've got a bunch of facebook's

[03:58.200 --> 04:03.880]  down pages so it's important to make your own pages as well in case they pull ours or this other one
[04:03.880 --> 04:08.920]  but this is a first amendment issue they claim well you know it's the first moment right of
[04:08.920 --> 04:13.560]  any to do this and that's right but if you're going to do something to somebody for a off the cuff
[04:13.560 --> 04:19.480]  thing in a magazine their personal views and then persecute them and then use it as a way to persecute
[04:19.480 --> 04:24.600]  everybody else's free speech we have free speech to boycott you it's like the head of pearl jam came
[04:24.600 --> 04:30.040]  out and said i don't like these people eddie vetter who they're trying to stop my free speech
[04:30.040 --> 04:36.920]  disagree with me they're fascist no no no free speech doesn't doesn't mean that that we then agree
[04:36.920 --> 04:43.080]  with you and adopt what you say that's not censorship when we disagree with you bozo

[05:16.360 --> 05:21.480]  that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the

[07:14.600 --> 07:21.000]  alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers
[07:21.000 --> 07:27.240]  to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record
[07:27.240 --> 07:33.640]  reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine

[08:38.040 --> 08:44.920]  i am coming to you from deep in the heart of texas austin where we had to pass in the last
[08:44.920 --> 08:53.000]  legislative session a law so that christmas trees and nativity scenes can be displayed
[08:53.000 --> 09:04.280]  on the holiday for which the holiday is named christmas or christ mass the meeting of followers
[09:04.280 --> 09:12.760]  of christ for the birth of the savior but you see the system the the the globalist who made the
[09:12.760 --> 09:20.440]  state god like any group that's conquered and usurped another is overriding christmas the
[09:20.440 --> 09:25.960]  christians overwrote many of the druidic rituals and the tanin bomb brought in during the darkest
[09:25.960 --> 09:32.680]  part of the year the ancients believe the 25th of december the evergreen tree and so it became
[09:32.680 --> 09:39.800]  the tanin bomb tanin bomb or tanin bomb and then was brightly adorned it now the ancient
[09:39.800 --> 09:47.640]  pagan symbol usurped by christians now has been usurped again by pagans but pagans that worship
[09:47.640 --> 09:55.160]  the state absolutely totally fitting and it's their active dominance their active control
[09:55.160 --> 10:03.880]  in our face that they could try to remove this image and you notice during this christmas time
[10:03.880 --> 10:09.560]  that there's an all-out assault on free speech because the globalists are losing the info war
[10:10.280 --> 10:17.240]  pentagon said that three months ago using the term info war because we have the white hot burning
[10:17.240 --> 10:23.240]  sword of truth that it will simply take it in our hands and take to the field will dismember
[10:23.240 --> 10:33.400]  frauds and dismember parasitic ideas and systems like a hot knife through butter but you have to
[10:33.400 --> 10:39.080]  have a fighting spirit you have to be aware of what's going on you have to decide you're not done
[10:39.080 --> 10:43.560]  you've got to decide you're not rolling over you got to get off your back where you present your
[10:43.560 --> 10:48.440]  belly to these wolves believing they're going to lick you in the face you don't present your belly
[10:48.440 --> 10:54.200]  to wolves that's what causes hell on earth and that's a message to all the timid people out there
[10:54.200 --> 11:02.040]  that think you're gonna be safe sitting on your butts i do not do what i do because i've got courage
[11:02.040 --> 11:06.520]  ladies and gentlemen i do what i do because i recognize a full-out authoritarian takeover
[11:06.520 --> 11:12.920]  when i see one and i leap into action because i want to preserve my flesh and that of my family
[11:12.920 --> 11:20.440]  that more importantly than preserving my flesh and my providence and my property and my independence
[11:21.320 --> 11:27.320]  is that i want to preserve my way of life and i want to instruct my children in the ways of my
[11:27.320 --> 11:34.280]  ancestors i don't want my children instructed in the ways of a bunch of globalist inbred control
[11:34.280 --> 11:44.360]  freak authoritarian trash i'm not your property my mind's not your property my soul is not your
[11:44.360 --> 11:51.880]  property and my children are not your property and their children are not your property do you hear
[11:51.880 --> 12:07.320]  me enemy you shall not pass now my friends we are live and broadcasting worldwide on this day
[12:08.120 --> 12:13.000]  and i want us all to commit today to lift up a standard of liberty in our own lives
[12:13.880 --> 12:21.480]  and to stand against any that attempt to make us adopt their way of life their religion their ideas
[12:21.480 --> 12:32.440]  their systems liberty and justice for all that is this republic and we will not have our holidays
[12:32.440 --> 12:39.560]  our systems our sacred rites trampled anymore and overwritten with the pitiful offering that you
[12:39.560 --> 12:48.360]  bring us all the globalist ugly music and ugly plastic corporate culture we vomit it up you
[12:48.360 --> 12:55.320]  have forced fed us long enough and america and the world needs to seek god's face and repent and
[12:55.320 --> 13:02.280]  ask that god pump the poison out of our soul and out of our guts because we are under a spell
[13:03.240 --> 13:11.960]  and we have to become aware of this mind control and break free from the new world order scientific
[13:11.960 --> 13:21.400]  technocracy and all of its technocratic incantations the beauty of christmas and of the carols
[13:22.360 --> 13:29.080]  is what they hate the beauty of what is at the center of it christ is what they hate because
[13:29.080 --> 13:37.560]  even if you don't believe in jesus christ the historical figure you should believe in those
[13:37.560 --> 13:48.040]  ideas and you should ask why they are opposed tenfold ten on every front by the powers of this earth
[13:54.120 --> 14:03.400]  and the god of this world thank you for joining us on the 20th day of december 2013 and i am
[14:03.400 --> 14:10.120]  fired up today because so much is happening and we can see the battle the battle being joined
[14:10.120 --> 14:19.480]  right now now continuing piers morgan has come out and said the first amendment shouldn't protect
[14:19.480 --> 14:28.360]  vile bigots like phil robertson so he should not have his speech and once they define what a bigot is
[14:28.360 --> 14:34.120]  all speech is taken you see piers morgan doesn't just want to remove the second amendment or the
[14:34.120 --> 14:43.240]  fourth amendment or the tenth amendment he wishes to remove the most sacred and first amongst all
[14:43.240 --> 14:49.800]  rights the right of speech the right of expression the right of art the right of literature the right
[14:49.800 --> 14:58.360]  of independent thought and individualism and the right to follow free will path that you choose and
[14:58.360 --> 15:07.400]  whatever flame you are drawn to we are not drawn to the same flame as you piers and we will never
[15:08.280 --> 15:16.280]  ever bow to the chains which you lay out before us like roses because we see the poison thorns
[15:16.280 --> 15:25.320]  piers morgan first amendment should shouldn't protect vile bigots like phil robertson national
[15:25.320 --> 15:30.200]  boycott launched against duck dynasty censorship and on solazar info wars dot com yesterday
[15:30.200 --> 15:36.600]  duck dynasty family released a statement on suspension of phil robertson says we're backing
[15:36.600 --> 15:44.840]  him we may leave the show we can't go on without him bravo it's the only course that's what it's
[15:44.840 --> 15:50.680]  all about standing up for free speech which is just like standing up for kin because the first
[15:50.680 --> 15:57.160]  amendment has been far hard fought and hard won and is our kin all of those first ten amendments
[15:57.160 --> 16:02.840]  which don't give us rights simply point out what already existed are the human birthright the human
[16:02.840 --> 16:09.240]  experience and are our kin and we can't turn our back on those liberties anymore that we could turn
[16:09.240 --> 16:19.080]  our back on our fathers our brothers our wives our sisters our daughters we are together and too long
[16:19.080 --> 16:23.960]  as the human community been divided against each other and that's what they're doing with all of
[16:23.960 --> 16:29.240]  this is another wedge issue to make it look like it's a civil right to ban people's free speech no
[16:29.240 --> 16:37.640]  it's not and it is out of love of free speech not out of hatred of a bunch of grandstanders
[16:37.640 --> 16:45.080]  who want to force their way of life on children this is Stalinistic as Camille Paglia has come out
[16:45.080 --> 16:54.520]  and said ultra Stalinistic this is what they did in the Soviet Union Paglia duck dynasty uproar
[16:54.520 --> 17:04.520]  utterly fascist utterly Stalinist and then Paul Watson wrote two absolutely essential
[17:04.520 --> 17:16.120]  absolutely key articles on info wars.com first Watson came out and said should the bible be
[17:16.120 --> 17:21.720]  banned as hate speech this morning and then pointed out in Canada and Germany in places
[17:21.720 --> 17:34.920]  if preachers read from the admonitions against homosexuality from the Levitical Jewish law of
[17:34.920 --> 17:45.240]  Moses 3000 plus years ago that they be fired and taken to jail and clapped in irons to serve
[17:45.240 --> 17:51.640]  long prison sentences now you notice Christianity's fair game to attack Christianity's fair game
[17:51.640 --> 17:59.080]  if you even talk about banning the Koran cities will burn Watson wrote that article to open the
[17:59.080 --> 18:05.480]  debate up the Koran is hate speech that's in quotes and should be banned the exact same headlines
[18:05.480 --> 18:15.800]  except instead of bible it says Koran duck dynasty controversy bible to be banned as hate speech
[18:15.800 --> 18:23.480]  that's in quotations the Koran is hate speech and should be banned Paul Joseph Watson
[18:27.080 --> 18:35.480]  there you go so we ask the question here it's okay to ban and restrict the bible and preachers
[18:35.480 --> 18:39.880]  preaching from it in the west now the former home of free speech and the renaissance of the
[18:39.880 --> 18:47.480]  enlightenment is it also okay no you can put out muslin and even menorahs those are in public in
[18:47.480 --> 18:52.680]  front of the capital but you will not put a cross out and you will not put a christmas tree out and
[18:52.680 --> 18:56.120]  i say the Rockefeller should stop having their christmas tree as well oh you say well it's
[18:56.120 --> 19:01.880]  private property oh but it's in a public comments you see they had to pass a law in texas a few
[19:01.880 --> 19:07.240]  years ago you can look this up in fact i want to give the exact law you guys pull up uh texas passes
[19:07.240 --> 19:13.000]  law for christian symbols at christmas perry got it signed and i'm not a huge fan of rick perry i'm a
[19:13.000 --> 19:19.720]  fan of that again rick perry has a lot of good rhetoric he just a lot of times stabs us in
[19:19.720 --> 19:23.800]  the back but he hasn't been better lately because he understands he needs to be more tea party or
[19:23.800 --> 19:28.200]  actually run for president win but that's that issue even george b bush running for texas uh
[19:28.200 --> 19:31.960]  what is it land commissioners doing the same song and dance the point is is that we're sending
[19:31.960 --> 19:36.440]  our reporters out leon macadoon jacarjax and leon will be live jacarjax will be shooting question
[19:36.440 --> 19:40.680]  and answer for the night we know i may have him on as well live at 12 30 coming up in about an
[19:40.680 --> 19:46.360]  hour and 10 minutes from uh down at the capital there in front of the christmas tree right at

[20:05.560 --> 20:11.240]  fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the american people so why
[20:11.240 --> 20:17.000]  are the social engineers adding it to the water simple dumb down the host population that the
[20:17.000 --> 20:22.040]  parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water
[20:22.040 --> 20:27.400]  supply yet but we can help to get it out of our bodies i am extremely excited to announce the

[25:01.240 --> 25:06.440]  out of newark daily news governor rick perry signs mary christmas bill into law allowing government
[25:06.440 --> 25:11.080]  building schools you name it your display religious symbols as long as least one secular
[25:11.080 --> 25:15.960]  or other religious symbol is also displayed at the signing ceremony high school cheerleaders or
[25:15.960 --> 25:23.640]  t-shirts that read i cheer for christ bingo and again folks you're not under the first amendment
[25:23.640 --> 25:27.240]  you have the right to free speech and in a letter thomas jeverson said we should not
[25:27.240 --> 25:31.640]  have a state-run religion we should have separation of church and state well yeah that's why the
[25:31.640 --> 25:36.440]  whole country started so you couldn't have the protestants say they were going to run the country
[25:36.440 --> 25:41.640]  or the catholics say they're going to run the country or jews you know coming and saying we're
[25:41.640 --> 25:46.200]  going to make that the state-run religion or anybody else for that matter you could practice
[25:46.200 --> 25:51.960]  whatever religion you wanted to but the country celebrates christmas that is pan christian
[25:52.760 --> 25:59.480]  across the board two thousand you know years old and it's what unifies christians but it's also a
[25:59.480 --> 26:03.960]  good time for forgiving each other and and spending time together in the dark of winter
[26:05.240 --> 26:09.960]  and it's a great holiday it's now now they've already overwritten it with santa claus and coca
[26:09.960 --> 26:15.640]  club since the 30s before that you know santa claus and let's talk about the netherlands or
[26:15.640 --> 26:20.280]  whatever was more of a crumpus type character who would come with coal and take you to hell
[26:20.840 --> 26:25.560]  they would for the last 400 years they banned christmas for over 100 years in london because
[26:25.560 --> 26:30.840]  the city routinely burned to the ground during the riots santa claus was a freddy kruger person
[26:30.840 --> 26:37.000]  literally with knives on his fingers and a striped shirt and a hat that's where they get freddy
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.440]  kruger from just so you don't know was for a couple hundred years it was a freddy kruger ghoul
[26:43.240 --> 26:48.360]  and then it was like devil's night like halloween is now in detroit where people go out and burn
[26:48.360 --> 26:53.480]  and murder and the word was they had a movie recently had to see it where they like all
[26:53.480 --> 26:57.000]  crime has been stopped but one night a year you're allowed to kill whoever you want if you can get
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.720]  away with it everybody locks themselves up in their houses then and everybody would just go out
[27:03.720 --> 27:09.960]  and basically start killing each other so they banned it you can look that up in the encyclopedia
[27:09.960 --> 27:15.960]  britannica i think was 300 years ago for about but 350 years ago for about 100 years so till
[27:15.960 --> 27:23.080]  about 250 years ago christmas was banned they would arrest you if you saw if they saw you in
[27:23.080 --> 27:30.040]  the santa claus outfit black boots red and white striped shirt people ran in terror it was party time
[27:30.040 --> 27:36.040]  get possessed have sex in the streets burn buildings kill your old enemies i mean this was
[27:36.040 --> 27:41.720]  devil's night so that shows how the pagans and the psychos are always trying to overwrite things
[27:41.720 --> 27:49.080]  so they brought in the modern santa claus in the last hundred years and merged him with crumpets
[27:49.880 --> 27:55.880]  we're going to report on monday on crumpets it's interesting culturally uh but we're sending our
[27:55.880 --> 28:04.040]  reporters down jacari jackson and leon macadoo they'll be there at 12 30 on the south side of the
[28:04.040 --> 28:09.400]  capital on the in front of the gates right in front of the christmas tree down there doing
[28:09.400 --> 28:14.520]  interviews with folks on your view on the attack on christmas at free speech that ties into duck

[28:19.240 --> 28:25.640]  announcement after the break i'll uh i'll just leave it i'll just leave it at that for everybody
[28:26.520 --> 28:32.200]  but we do have these articles that are up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com the

[28:46.200 --> 28:52.680]  according to uh what they're getting into uh then then this should be this should be banned
[28:52.680 --> 28:56.920]  as well and guys during the break remind me i need a new headset and get rid of this cord it's
[28:56.920 --> 29:01.240]  stripped out and just keeps coming out of the plug for days and i just need to get rid of it i'm
[29:01.240 --> 29:06.280]  gonna throw in the trash that's driving me crazy keeps falling out of the deal so here it is christmas

[29:12.360 --> 29:18.680]  to allow the first amendment and and and for culture to be this is culture this is what christmas is
[29:18.680 --> 29:24.520]  xmas now they call it winter holiday and and and it's cult like and it's a big deal so when we get

[33:16.520 --> 33:26.920]  jones on the gcn radio network it is essential if you are a radio or tv viewer radio listener
[33:26.920 --> 33:31.960]  right tv viewer or if you're a supporter of the first amendment and just happened across this
[33:31.960 --> 33:37.880]  broadcast today to go to info wars dot com we just launched a new facebook page i should have
[33:37.880 --> 33:45.400]  thought of this yesterday that says new facebook page boycott a and e support free speech now there's
[33:45.400 --> 33:49.880]  one thing boycott a and e but we want to point out the whole free speech act aspect of this
[33:50.520 --> 33:56.120]  and really get to the issue of this is not tolerance this is police state and stylistic
[33:56.680 --> 34:02.920]  as gay activist camille paglia has properly uh pointed out and and she's a very reasonable
[34:02.920 --> 34:07.320]  smart lady about the culture and how the system is using this whole liberal movement as a
[34:07.960 --> 34:13.160]  basically cultural takeover to be bigoted against people that aren't basically communist
[34:13.160 --> 34:18.600]  socialists uh and who don't adopt their new world order views and their anti-human views
[34:19.480 --> 34:23.160]  and i agree with her breakdown of that they're trying to break down the family
[34:23.160 --> 34:27.320]  to bring in total cultural control they're trying to destroy men and has nothing to do with
[34:27.320 --> 34:34.920]  empowering other people's civil rights so new facebook page boycott a and e support free speech
[34:35.720 --> 34:39.720]  i do not agree with what you have to say but i'll defend it to the death
[34:39.720 --> 34:45.800]  your right to say it is uh the sub headline that uh watson has there so whether you agree
[34:45.800 --> 34:51.960]  with the statements or agree with them or disagree with them it is absolutely essential
[34:51.960 --> 34:58.440]  to go to info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and to find the link uh that we have at the
[34:58.440 --> 35:04.280]  bottom of the article we should also add it to the top of the article it's info wars free speech
[35:04.280 --> 35:14.120]  and we need to defend free speech we need to promote free speech we need uh to educate the public
[35:14.840 --> 35:20.280]  and so uh we have other facebook's with two million likes uh our biggest one
[35:21.240 --> 35:24.600]  because we created a whole bunch i guess about four or five years ago actually
[35:24.600 --> 35:31.800]  activists did and gave them to us we appreciate that um has six hundred and seventy six thousand
[35:31.800 --> 35:37.160]  nine hundred and sixty four likes and that's the alex emrick jones that's my official uh
[35:37.160 --> 35:40.120]  facebook because later they made me actually contact them and give them my driver's license
[35:40.120 --> 35:47.320]  to prove that it's actually mine so folks couldn't spoof me as they were doing and we're getting this
[35:47.320 --> 35:57.000]  new um page posted on that page as well absolutely essential that everyone go to our main facebook
[35:57.000 --> 36:03.720]  and that uh and we're going to have it added there paul's doing that right now and then everyone go
[36:03.720 --> 36:10.760]  to the info wars to find the actual link it's info wars free speech facebook dot com for slash
[36:10.760 --> 36:15.560]  info wars free speech one word and we're going to really beef it up with all the articles about
[36:15.560 --> 36:21.560]  free speech how the authoritarians take fake civil rights which a fake civil right is saying you
[36:21.560 --> 36:26.440]  can't disagree with my lifestyle you can't have your own church where you say that homosexuality
[36:26.440 --> 36:32.600]  is a sin along with adultery and i mean is that bigoted now to say adultery ends up hurting kids
[36:32.600 --> 36:37.480]  it isn't a good idea does it mean everybody's perfect does it mean we all throw stones at each
[36:37.480 --> 36:44.120]  other does it mean we all say you're bad that you're inherently a bad person no drinking too much
[36:44.120 --> 36:49.240]  is a sin according to the bible i tend to agree with that i mean it is drinking too much is bad
[36:49.240 --> 36:56.120]  for you it is a sin is a sin against god's creation and against god our body's supposed to be a temple
[36:56.120 --> 37:02.440]  but if you don't agree with that that's fine that's your right but i don't have to adopt
[37:02.440 --> 37:07.240]  your ideas you shouldn't take my tax money set up a government training camp called the public school
[37:07.240 --> 37:11.960]  and teach first graders through 12th graders how to have anal sex and how to masturbate
[37:13.080 --> 37:18.920]  they've turned promoting pedophilia and the state teaching kids sexual stuff
[37:18.920 --> 37:26.040]  into a right and into tolerance it's outrageous and again it's because they know if they can
[37:26.040 --> 37:30.120]  set the precedent to kick a kid out of school because they were seen playing with a nerf gun
[37:30.120 --> 37:35.320]  with their friends in the backyard and the neighbor knows to call the school and the school actually
[37:35.320 --> 37:38.920]  acts on it outside of their jurisdiction to kick some out of school that's crazy but it's meant to
[37:38.920 --> 37:47.720]  be crazy new york garden city two guys are out washing their car in their own driveway at their
[37:47.720 --> 37:53.080]  own house cop comes up and says listen your neighbor called you're not allowed to wash your car in your
[37:53.080 --> 37:55.640]  in your drone driveway this is not your private property
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.360]  and they're doing it across the board the tsa all of it we have to come together for free
[38:04.360 --> 38:10.440]  speech folks i don't get up here on my show and bash gay people i don't over the years 18 years on
[38:10.440 --> 38:16.440]  air it's not my issue until now because i can't turn a television on i can't open a newspaper
[38:16.440 --> 38:24.120]  up i i mean i am sick of it if i loved a song and i heard it a five thousand times folks i'd get
[38:24.120 --> 38:29.000]  sick of it you know songs you own the cd or the record or the tape cassette or whatever
[38:29.000 --> 38:33.400]  or you've had it on your ipad or ipod and you've heard it 500 times you get sick of it
[38:33.400 --> 38:36.040]  and then you hear it a few years later you're like man i'm still sick of that song
[38:38.040 --> 38:43.160]  i mean i'm like neutral on all this stuff i want to live my own life live and let live
[38:43.160 --> 38:48.840]  but man i am sick of it this is like sexual harassment is what it is it really is it just
[38:48.840 --> 38:54.120]  hit me this whole gay mafia agenda is sexual harassment ladies and gentlemen
[38:57.240 --> 39:02.120]  and by the way i never even thought about this in college and stuff i should even tell these
[39:02.120 --> 39:06.600]  stories i just you know i was a guy so i didn't really take offense at like a girl would have
[39:06.600 --> 39:10.680]  some guy kept hitting on her over and over again but me i had have guys follow me in my car
[39:10.680 --> 39:16.920]  or hit on me constantly in class just absolutely follow me to the gym find out where i live come
[39:16.920 --> 39:23.000]  knock on the door i mean i probably 15 times was absolutely trailed by peppy lapue gay guys
[39:23.720 --> 39:27.720]  because i was pretty good looking you know back when i was in college and the point is is that i
[39:27.720 --> 39:34.200]  was like no no no that's all right i mean that's right but here's the thing it almost if a woman
[39:34.200 --> 39:38.680]  was doing that it almost would be kind of freaky you know what i mean i'm attracted to women
[39:38.680 --> 39:42.600]  but the point is i don't hate people that just because they're attracted to something
[39:43.880 --> 39:50.280]  my issue is is this is authoritarianism ladies and gentlemen and it's pushed and it's pushed
[39:50.280 --> 39:56.440]  and it's pushed and it's pushed and it's pushed and man i feel like i'm being peppy lapute here
[39:57.640 --> 40:03.560]  and the larger issue is then you've got groups that have gotten on the bandwagon the pedophiles
[40:03.560 --> 40:07.880]  promote sexualization of children and the un and saying namble is good and the american you know
[40:07.880 --> 40:13.400]  psychological association saying it's not a problem no it is a problem and if you get around my kids
[40:15.560 --> 40:23.400]  until they're 16 i'm coming after you it's real simple anybody touches my kids or comes
[40:23.400 --> 40:29.320]  after especially my daughters i mean you are going to get some trouble there's a few things
[40:29.320 --> 40:32.920]  that'll punch my buttons but anybody ever hurts my kids you know what's going to happen to you
[40:32.920 --> 40:40.840]  and i'm not going to say anymore default you're not going to like what happens to you
[40:43.240 --> 40:47.800]  and it comes down to that and that's why i've gotten so angry this is a mafia this is an
[40:47.800 --> 40:53.240]  authoritarianism and there's big pushback there's a million likes on a brand new deal out there to
[40:53.240 --> 40:58.040]  boycott a and e but i think they're saying some things that are good some things i don't agree with
[40:58.040 --> 41:02.280]  ours is all about free speech and all about how this is fascism and i'm going to post a link to
[41:02.280 --> 41:06.520]  the camille paglia statement in there as well because we need to we need to unify around
[41:06.520 --> 41:13.560]  the first amendment and not let this be a wedge issue it's very very simple and i personally
[41:13.560 --> 41:22.920]  am just really sick and tired of all of this being foisted upon everyone so that's where
[41:22.920 --> 41:29.240]  this stands info wars dot com prison planet dot com i need to tweet it out at real alex jones
[41:29.240 --> 41:34.360]  watson's already done it for me two minutes ago so retweet that at real alex jones new
[41:34.360 --> 41:40.600]  facebook page boycott a and e support free speech very important free speech doesn't mean intolerance
[41:40.600 --> 41:45.960]  and censorship of anyone who disagrees with you that's a peace breaking down the live show
[41:46.680 --> 41:50.440]  the caran is hate speech and should be banned central text of islam advocates
[41:50.440 --> 41:55.320]  stoning homosexuals to death and again we're quoting what someone said on fox news yesterday
[41:55.320 --> 41:59.240]  we're not saying that i won't even though it's in quotes some people don't understand that they're
[41:59.240 --> 42:03.720]  getting mad so whatever deal with it your ignorance is no excuse to violate my first amendment
[42:05.240 --> 42:11.160]  so uh that is just some of what's happening police help us now here's the other news let me
[42:11.160 --> 42:16.280]  just tell you who's coming up on the broadcast today larry claimant who who stood up against
[42:16.280 --> 42:21.000]  the censorship of cnn and it really blew up in their face he's going to pop in for 15 minutes

[42:45.880 --> 42:53.000]  amendment shouldn't protect vile bigots like phil robertson so there you go ladies and gentlemen

[43:01.880 --> 43:07.000]  dalis by the sheriff's deputies to be clear the dalis police were apologized and totally freaked

[43:43.000 --> 43:47.480]  together as humans under basic liberty and protect everyone's rights if they get us all fighting
[43:47.480 --> 43:52.360]  with each other over all these little sub issues they've divided and conquered us that's what it
[43:52.360 --> 43:57.960]  comes down to and that's what msnbc and the democratic party and all of them are there to promote
[43:57.960 --> 44:03.400]  is authoritarianism in the name of civil rights taking our rights away so someone else isn't
[44:03.400 --> 44:09.560]  offended we saw a movie star this week say you shouldn't be able to call someone fat and then
[44:09.560 --> 44:15.400]  i saw some other pundits say that you know arrest someone if they call you fat arrest bullies and
[44:15.400 --> 44:20.040]  the anti-bully training in schools national study showed this year has tripled bullying
[44:22.440 --> 44:28.440]  yeah jennifer laurence that's a movie star right i don't really know hunger games oh she did that
[44:29.080 --> 44:33.320]  i'm i think she's a very talented actress and very feminine but also i think she's
[44:33.320 --> 44:37.480]  a great heroine i like strong beautiful women and that really bums me out
[44:39.560 --> 44:43.080]  oh but she's not the main actress who's the who's the who's the who's the brunette
[44:44.440 --> 44:49.400]  that's her she just doesn't look attractive there uh whatever just what a bummer just get it off the
[44:49.400 --> 44:57.880]  screen i just i just it's just so horrible um anyways it's just and and they're getting all
[44:57.880 --> 45:04.600]  these airheads on television to go yeah i think we should have the president says uh britney spears
[45:04.600 --> 45:09.640]  or i think we should ban calling someone fat or yeah yeah let's ban literature that criticizes
[45:09.640 --> 45:16.680]  something i mean they're this is intellectual book burning it's fascism it's stylistic commie
[45:16.680 --> 45:25.480]  garbage 101 incontrovertible debates over it's happening and that's why i'm so upset today
[45:25.480 --> 45:29.880]  ladies and gentlemen i am so upset right now because it just gets more and more crazy but
[45:29.880 --> 45:34.920]  they're doing this because they know we're waking up and taking action and if they can take some
[45:34.920 --> 45:41.480]  country bumpkin hillbilly some lovable hillbilly everybody loves the american story of a hillbilly
[45:41.480 --> 45:46.600]  or somebody else you know striking it rich with with inventions and ideas that's the old americana
[45:46.600 --> 45:51.160]  and they and they genuinely are christians and i've seen the show a few times they're funny
[45:51.160 --> 45:56.120]  reminds me too much of family in east texas quite frankly so i got a bunch of family looks
[45:56.120 --> 46:05.880]  and acts just like it and anyways i've turned down so many reality shows i guess these are so
[46:05.880 --> 46:10.600]  hot i can move to east texas and it'll literally be me broadcasting there with my family i mean
[46:10.600 --> 46:16.200]  i'm telling you it looks like the duck dynasty a bunch of them got the beards and the whole nine
[46:16.200 --> 46:20.200]  yards but that's when you got the beard out in the countryside that means you're widely and don't
[46:20.200 --> 46:25.080]  like the system and everything and her hillbilly ish just i'm telling it's like a uniform and then
[46:25.080 --> 46:29.640]  the guys that have this the cowboy hats and her shave and everything they're in the in town guys
[46:29.640 --> 46:34.200]  and kind of laugh at the hillbillies i'm telling you it's all like like clubs so i got family

[46:39.560 --> 46:50.520]  know work in town and then you've got the hillbillies that get off my land anyways i'm telling i can't
[46:50.520 --> 46:53.880]  watch that show it's like watching family or something because you got to know east texas
[46:53.880 --> 47:00.280]  is basically an extension of louisiana it's basically the same thing okay ladies and gentlemen
[47:00.280 --> 47:06.200]  in fact my uncle joe kind of looks like phil well there's no kind of looks like him and there's no
[47:06.200 --> 47:13.000]  kind of that's what my dad looks like if you didn't have if you had a longer beard i mean that's about
[47:13.000 --> 47:19.160]  what i mean that's about it right there anyways like my dad got a big bear about 10 years ago
[47:19.160 --> 47:26.440]  now i don't i just realized he looks like phil robertson this is amazing anyways it is same
[47:26.440 --> 47:31.800]  eyes same nose same eyebrows that looks like my dad guys does that look like my dad if you had a
[47:31.800 --> 47:39.800]  longer beard looks like pretty funny anyways side issue ladies and gentlemen continuing
[47:39.800 --> 47:46.920]  right along here today let's get into something interesting you know it's funny this morning i
[47:46.920 --> 47:52.840]  was thinking about pierce morgan for some reason which i hardly ever think about when i was out
[47:52.840 --> 48:05.480]  having a jog uh in the uh dawn twilight and i said you ought to look at the text messages from
[48:05.480 --> 48:10.920]  their producers so i went in and looked and noticed that i've been texted by one so i texted that one
[48:10.920 --> 48:14.680]  just asking how are you doing alex like a few months ago and i hadn't seen it and hadn't texted
[48:14.680 --> 48:18.920]  them back because i had so many text messages then i saw another one of the producers and i
[48:18.920 --> 48:23.960]  sent them both text messages and one of them texted me back saying hi and then i challenged them i said
[48:23.960 --> 48:28.600]  look it's now time to have me on you know you got record two million viewers compared to your half
[48:28.600 --> 48:33.000]  million and you keep sinking why haven't you had me back on well one of the producers said because
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.880]  higher up said it gave me too much attention see because i really won that folks i got people to
[48:37.880 --> 48:42.200]  think it's about disarming us not about their debate they're just trying to keep us safe so i
[48:42.200 --> 48:49.480]  sent them a text message back and i said i challenge you to have me on you can even do it be a
[48:49.480 --> 48:55.880]  satellite taped if you're chicken because i did attack you know they're prozac sponsors and stuff
[48:55.880 --> 49:00.280]  instead of blaming guns you know blame blame really what's what's what's at the core of it or one of
[49:00.280 --> 49:06.040]  the key things at the core kind of like there's a pie that's the heart of what's happening and a big
[49:06.040 --> 49:11.080]  slice of that heart big slice of that pie is a serotonin reuptake inhibitors and it's the the
[49:11.080 --> 49:15.240]  shoot them up video games designed to program troops to kill then it's the fact that the kids are
[49:15.240 --> 49:22.200]  always the occult socialist communist democrats all on record uh and i'm just don't like the fact
[49:22.200 --> 49:29.480]  communist socialist satan worshipper democrat occultist shoot them up video game heads get obsessed
[49:29.480 --> 49:34.120]  with death and dressing up in you know black trench coats when you see these kids at the mall
[49:34.120 --> 49:37.400]  or on the street they'll be like 10 up and trying to scare you because they've got like white makeup
[49:37.400 --> 49:41.240]  on and all i want to do is like i mean i'm a normal loving person but if people try to
[49:41.240 --> 49:44.680]  menace me i immediately think about how i would attack all of them and just start ramming their
[49:44.680 --> 49:49.160]  heads over the wall it's easier to beat up 10 people than beat up one i'm telling you there's
[49:49.160 --> 49:53.800]  just nothing like just going right just savagely attacking people and ramming their heads into walls
[49:53.800 --> 50:00.440]  excuse me the point is is that i mean you know how it is i'm a little bit crazy today after that
[50:00.440 --> 50:05.960]  jog behind the scenes that these endorphins hit me i haven't felt since i was like 14 i think it
[50:05.960 --> 50:11.560]  may be the super male vitality but i mean i am literally resembling a like an orc or something

[1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:31.640]  world and it is authoritarianism but they do it through kind of a fake liberal cover that they're

[1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:55.960]  it was a predominantly hispanic team playing another hispanic team most i saw the kids on tv
[1:10:55.960 --> 1:11:00.440]  it was very few of them were uh black or white it was mainly hispanic basketball team against
[1:11:00.440 --> 1:11:04.520]  another hispanic basketball team from closer to the border and the more liberal team because
[1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:12.920]  san Antonio is very conservative were chanting usa usa because that's just kind of the mindless
[1:11:12.920 --> 1:11:18.280]  chant people do at sports games now when their basketball team won and it was a big thing it was
[1:11:18.280 --> 1:11:23.400]  came out a few months ago they're like whoa this is evil i mean this is racist there were kids
[1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:31.640]  chanting usa everything's offensive call somebody fat hunger game star says you need to be arrested

[1:11:39.800 --> 1:11:44.680]  pierce morgan first amendment quote shouldn't protect vile bigots like phil robertson see he
[1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:50.840]  wants all your rights not just the second amendment he wants the fourth tenth first all of it gone
[1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:56.200]  and again we have a clip here i'm gonna play in a moment pierce morgan uh in the last few days
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:12:01.240]  he's been having votes on the cnn website they've closed the voting now uh for who you think
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:07.480]  well it was the most memorable guest or moment in the year and his show doesn't matter unless you
[1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:11.640]  are the big moment they got picked up all the tv shows his show has a tiny audience ours is much
[1:12:11.640 --> 1:12:17.160]  bigger on record he barely has a half million viewers total i mean that is pathetic folks larry
[1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:20.440]  king used to have 10 million more than a decade ago and then when they got rid of them it was
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:24.680]  like two and a half three million and then it plunged after that down to less than a half
[1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:31.400]  million for pierce morgan on an average night i mean it is in the tank and pierce morgan
[1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:38.120]  when i was on still had about 600 700 000 viewers in a year he's gone down to below 500 000 and they
[1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:44.360]  admitted two million viewers that night the next night he had a ratings jump of still over a million
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:48.600]  and for two weeks was over a million because i was on his show and they could talk about the
[1:12:48.600 --> 1:12:55.960]  aftermath i mean it was on every comedy show j leno you name it uh it was on foreign news i mean
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:13:01.640]  that that is one of the top media events of the year and it was simply someone saying you want to
[1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:07.480]  enslave us and take our guns and if you try it 1776 will commence again is that clear stop lying
[1:13:07.480 --> 1:13:11.640]  stop acting like it's about kids everywhere you people are in control you take all the guns
[1:13:11.640 --> 1:13:17.080]  except for the state it's about a monopoly of power diane feinstein says mrs and miss america if i
[1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:21.800]  can get the votes we're going to ban your guns stop saying it isn't about banning guns here in new
[1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:26.200]  york city guns are banned except for the very wealthy that have bodyguards or politically connected
[1:13:26.200 --> 1:13:30.440]  who are able to get the concealed carries this is a form of discrimination we have a right to defend
[1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:38.680]  ourselves and that was so shocking me paul revere folks went around and said get your guns kill people
[1:13:38.680 --> 1:13:42.520]  and they were like oh that's an american patriot because the british were coming to take the guns
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:47.400]  all i say is don't try to take our guns and even main like conservatives at first were like oh my
[1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:53.800]  gosh it's so mean oh my gosh it's so aggressive he discredits us well then go ahead and chop your
[1:13:53.800 --> 1:13:58.920]  wave those off and mail them in to pierce morgan because or mail them into obama because if that's
[1:13:58.920 --> 1:14:05.000]  the way you think and that's how pathetic you've gotten that that i am a wimp compared to founding
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:11.160]  fathers people like thomas pain people like george washington people like alexander hamilton i mean
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:19.560]  i am a milk toast limp-risted wimp and you people think i'm a big mean fire breathing dragon for

[1:15:00.520 --> 1:15:05.240]  about it talking about you know i think santa claus is white coming on megan kelly and i said they're
[1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:09.240]  not going to call back there's a standing order to not have me on the lower levels always call me
[1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:14.280]  and then it gets countermanded and and listen i'll do it taped i'll do it with my hands tied behind
[1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:20.040]  my back wimp and i'll go on and just give you an intellectual deadpan interview and that'll be
[1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:24.840]  newsworthy that last year it was like this this time he was on valium you know that'll be the joke
[1:15:24.840 --> 1:15:30.360]  i'm ready to come on intellectually right now i'm ready to have you on right now pierce morgan
[1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:34.440]  here's pierce morgan last night i'm talking about the number one thing on his show in 2013
[1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:39.800]  okay well we now have a drum roll uh this is number one this was the uh voted for by viewers all
[1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:45.800]  day long on on twitter and other social media on the internet uh this is the single most popular
[1:15:45.800 --> 1:15:50.840]  clip from my show of the year and i think it plays very well to the the main theme of the show this
[1:15:50.840 --> 1:15:58.280]  year too let's watch this hitler took the guns stalin took the guns mal took the guns the del castro
[1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:03.720]  took the guns how many you go show this took the guns and i'm here to tell you 1776 will commence
[1:16:03.720 --> 1:16:08.520]  again if you try to take our firearms doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street
[1:16:08.520 --> 1:16:13.560]  begging for them to have their guns taken we will not relinquish them do you understand that's why
[1:16:13.560 --> 1:16:18.360]  you're going to fail and the establishment knows no matter how much propaganda the republic will
[1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:22.360]  rise again when you attempt to take our guns please
[1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:27.320]  if you just let me keep talking pierce morgan the world and all the crazy gun now you don't have to
[1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:31.880]  ask any tough questions i'll just keep talking to everybody and no everything is to know that that
[1:16:31.880 --> 1:16:37.800]  guy has a gun and probably has several guns okay well we now have a drum roll uh that's it so so oh
[1:16:37.800 --> 1:16:42.600]  my gosh i have a gun and on the same show a week after i was on they said they're gonna dress pierce
[1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:47.720]  up with a gun to kill me he said yes i want to kill him i mean there's just a bunch of mental patients
[1:16:48.440 --> 1:16:52.280]  so there you go the guy making fun of somebody standing up for his rights just like i do for the
[1:16:52.280 --> 1:16:58.040]  first amendment tenth amendment fourth amendment and then larry claimant stands up people's rights
[1:16:58.040 --> 1:17:04.200]  and cnn demonizes him as well so uh we need to go to cnn we need to go to pierce morgan's twitter
[1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:09.480]  i need to tweet him during the break uh i forgot to do that and say hey come on
[1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:15.800]  go read my article at info wars dot com i promise well i've already talked to pierce morgan before
[1:17:15.800 --> 1:17:20.360]  we're gonna play that later uh i got a tip he was gonna be at a gun range a few months after this
[1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:24.600]  uh outside houston and so i went down there and walked in and got a chance to talk to him
[1:17:26.280 --> 1:17:32.040]  and i gave them my word i said i will be nice to him since they called me if you let me go talk
[1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:37.080]  to him and i went and i was polite i'm a man of my word unless he slaps me in the face or something
[1:17:37.080 --> 1:17:40.920]  which is kind of thing he'd do maybe i'm joking then i'll be friendly so pierce morgan has no
[1:17:40.920 --> 1:17:45.480]  excuse but they're afraid folks so so i bet they don't have me back on even though they get record
[1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:51.640]  ratings this isn't about ratings it's about control now speaking of control we're going to play the
[1:17:51.640 --> 1:17:56.600]  clip in a moment we're going to skip this network break larry claimant who has had the only victory
[1:17:56.600 --> 1:18:02.200]  against the nsa's open destruction of the fourth amendment and violation of all of our privacy
[1:18:02.200 --> 1:18:07.720]  and robbing us in our homes of our liberty and of our basic freedoms larry claiming that the
[1:18:07.720 --> 1:18:13.160]  famous icon of liberty a constitutional lawyer has had so many victories gotten so many government
[1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:19.560]  documents out on north american union on clinton you name it always being demonized cnn rolled a
[1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:26.280]  piece to six minute pieces upon info wars dot com saying that larry claiming just wants attention
[1:18:26.280 --> 1:18:32.120]  and is a you know magpie and is a gadfly and you know this doesn't matter and he's a bad guy and
[1:18:32.120 --> 1:18:38.760]  such and such called him an idiot and so they had this incredibly slanted yellow journalism piece
[1:18:38.760 --> 1:18:43.240]  that they rolled into him then they brought him up and had a couple people gang up on him the host
[1:18:44.360 --> 1:18:48.840]  and when he said how dare you carry the water for obama this is all americans losing our right
[1:18:48.840 --> 1:18:53.480]  which we need to come together against the illegal spine and they just started saying cut him off cut
[1:18:53.480 --> 1:18:57.400]  him off but then the producers knew it would look bad they had to wait till they went to commercial
[1:18:57.400 --> 1:19:01.720]  like with me with pierce morgan so they didn't cut him off and it blew up in their face and
[1:19:01.720 --> 1:19:07.320]  even politico that is a democratic party operation had to admit it it literally looked bad for cnn
[1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:11.640]  we're gonna play a short clip of that in a moment but i wanted to get him on because this ties into
[1:19:11.640 --> 1:19:17.320]  duck dynasty it ties into pierce morgan saying censor duck dynasty censor anyone that has free
[1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:22.040]  speech they're openly arresting preachers in canada that read out of the bible and criticize
[1:19:22.040 --> 1:19:26.920]  homosexuality and folks i don't get into this issue but the point is is i will fight for people's
[1:19:26.920 --> 1:19:33.800]  rights to to to to to be gay or to not be and i'm sick of them promoting it in schools i don't
[1:19:33.800 --> 1:19:39.160]  want to promote any sex in schools and i'm beginning really sick of the gay mafia because
[1:19:39.160 --> 1:19:43.000]  they really are out of control and dominating the culture and trying to force this stuff down
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:49.240]  our throats and i don't like it i don't want dom perion uh and the finest filet mignon forced
[1:19:49.240 --> 1:19:53.960]  down my throat okay so i don't like being a slave and so i'll get larry claimant's brief
[1:19:53.960 --> 1:19:58.520]  take on that as well but first off wow this cnn thing sir really blew up in their face and
[1:19:58.520 --> 1:20:04.680]  the demonization of you and your legal team across the board in all the comments in all the major
[1:20:04.680 --> 1:20:10.200]  socialist newspapers is really blowing up and the left the grassroots left really doesn't
[1:20:10.200 --> 1:20:15.000]  like seeing you be attacked because you've been very eloquent in standing up for our speech how
[1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:22.200]  do they turn you a hero into a zero uh i don't think they can do it larry claiming alex you know
[1:20:22.200 --> 1:20:28.040]  that's the uh formula that they use is that when they don't want you to get oxygen and obviously
[1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:35.240]  this was the biggest victory i think uh perhaps in the history against government uh abuse and
[1:20:35.240 --> 1:20:39.080]  they couldn't stand it that we did it i mean obviously the aclu had done it there would have
[1:20:39.080 --> 1:20:46.040]  been a parade but they're worried about our other cases about obama and uh what's this you know
[1:20:46.040 --> 1:20:53.320]  women is a very pro ultra leftist uh two minutes it was very pro clinton i thought him during
[1:20:53.320 --> 1:20:57.880]  the clinton years so you know it was a hit piece and it's as simple as that they try to take you
[1:20:57.880 --> 1:21:02.760]  down a notch uh so you're not as effective you know in terms of fundraising or whatever else you
[1:21:02.760 --> 1:21:07.320]  may do and that's the formula that they use this obviously came out of the white house
[1:21:08.040 --> 1:21:14.360]  and where the democratic national committee are both and you know we saw the result well you're
[1:21:14.360 --> 1:21:17.480]  right and for those that didn't see the clip we're not going to play the whole thing we'll play a
[1:21:17.480 --> 1:21:23.080]  short clip in a moment uh i mean the hit piece they rolled the special report before it i mean
[1:21:23.080 --> 1:21:30.520]  they they basically claim you you sunk the titanic i mean you're a bad guy well you know uh the the
[1:21:30.520 --> 1:21:35.320]  funny thing is i pointed out on that interview is that i actually got a lot of accolades from the
[1:21:35.320 --> 1:21:40.600]  left you know after that decision came out because this is an issue it doesn't uh kind of it does cut
[1:21:40.600 --> 1:21:46.520]  across uh different political lines that one and the reality is this is for all america and
[1:21:46.520 --> 1:21:50.600]  after i pointed out in that interview this is a victory for the united states this is a victory
[1:21:50.600 --> 1:21:55.640]  for the american people this is a victory for anybody that believes in liberty uh anyone that
[1:21:55.640 --> 1:21:59.400]  believes in keeping the government off your backs so they can't destroy you because we've kind of
[1:21:59.400 --> 1:22:05.880]  police state so you know it spoke for itself now you know anybody who's seen don levin it's always
[1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:12.040]  a sarcastic remark about conservatives or libertarians or about republicans and as far as
[1:22:12.040 --> 1:22:16.600]  jeffrey tubin is concerned uh those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones through a google
[1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:22.360]  search a couple years ago he was hauled into court because he impregnated jeff brinkfield's
[1:22:23.320 --> 1:22:30.040]  daughter at cbs and he was married at the time so this is a guy that claimed you know great ethics
[1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:35.560]  and great morality uh and in terms of levin levin has made certain statements you can find him
[1:22:35.560 --> 1:22:41.560]  out there he said well only i know my political affiliation well there are quotes and we're gonna
[1:22:41.560 --> 1:22:48.840]  you know be issuing a press release on this where he disparages that old white guy in the republican
[1:22:48.840 --> 1:22:53.800]  party uh and goes on to actually much worse sure he's i mean i can't even watch him when i see him
[1:22:53.800 --> 1:23:01.800]  on he's so pretentious uh he is just just drips with propaganda and arrogance another out of control
[1:23:01.800 --> 1:23:07.800]  lying narcissist well you know you know and i didn't want to pick a fight i went over there i was
[1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:14.440]  invited to invite somebody like that to lynching uh you know that's just low class very low class
[1:23:14.440 --> 1:23:18.200]  but i i knew what they were going to do because in the beginning we were in the green room i was
[1:23:18.200 --> 1:23:23.720]  in there with my chief of staff and we saw you know the trailer come on with me giving the speech
[1:23:23.720 --> 1:23:28.520]  in front of the world war two memorial i'm talking about obama bowling down to a la
[1:23:28.520 --> 1:23:34.120]  Franklin i don't back off that he does and uh favors muslim interests over american and israeli
[1:23:34.120 --> 1:23:38.760]  interests but it's not even a dispute but we knew we knew that it was likely to be something but i
[1:23:38.760 --> 1:23:44.760]  didn't expect it to that extent and you know the the story was who was larry claiming not
[1:23:45.720 --> 1:23:50.200]  what about the ns day and that tells you everything but you know i've been going through this throughout
[1:23:50.200 --> 1:23:55.880]  my career alex you go through it i mean they attack you similarly and others who stand for something
[1:23:55.880 --> 1:24:01.000]  and you can't be deterred and our founding fathers were called all kinds of names by the
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:06.280]  tories uh their lives were threatened there were bounties on their heads and i'm willing to lay it
[1:24:06.280 --> 1:24:13.160]  on the line this decision that we got and i'm not just saying it because i got it by the grace of god
[1:24:13.160 --> 1:24:19.080]  and it's you know it's just one little part of our second american revolution and i believe the
[1:24:19.080 --> 1:24:24.440]  decision will hold up but it was a remarkable decision it was probably the strongest decision
[1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:29.000]  ever issued against the government because never has there been a violation of constitutional
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:35.560]  rights of this magnitude and the stakes are extremely high so you can expect you know this
[1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:41.160]  kind of reaction but it's interesting if you see what's out there on youtube because the clip is up
[1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:45.320]  i don't know if the full club is up because when cnn put it up they took the lead in and they took
[1:24:45.320 --> 1:24:50.920]  it out because that was the really uh the famatory part that was coming in they don't show that they
[1:24:50.920 --> 1:24:55.800]  want me to look like i'm attacking them absolutely and i want to just remind people how big this
[1:24:55.800 --> 1:25:00.840]  this ruling is for the uh nsa and the fact that the judge said you know this looks exactly like
[1:25:00.840 --> 1:25:06.920]  fourth amendment violation uh the suits going forward and then he excoriated the nsa saying the
[1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:11.960]  emperor has no clothes saying what we all know and you're saying we're in a police state and now
[1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:16.920]  you've got the highest level uh nsa whistleblower ever coming out saying you're right we're in a
[1:25:16.920 --> 1:25:24.120]  serious police state and i mean you're just saying black is black white is white up is up down is down
[1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:29.480]  left is left right is right two plus two equals four and in the age of common core they're saying it
[1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:35.560]  equals five and as george arwell said telling the truth in a tyranny in a world of universal
[1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:41.320]  deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act so you're a revolutionary and and and we stand with
[1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:47.560]  you and it just shows who the media is that across the so-called liberal media they've been trying to
[1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:54.040]  demonize you that the but how does this dovetail with the duck dynasty situation regardless of what
[1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:58.760]  we think about lifestyles they're now saying you know pierce morgan is saying you don't have a first
[1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:03.880]  amendment i mean these people are really authoritarians that camille paglia says they're fascist and
[1:26:03.880 --> 1:26:11.160]  ultra Stalinist i agree what do you say well i say that it's black or white out it you know it
[1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:15.480]  it doesn't take to be you don't have to be rocket scientists to figure out that government has all
[1:26:15.480 --> 1:26:20.520]  of everybody's metadata 300 plus million people and that's why the judge's decision was so simple
[1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:26.120]  and easy to reach he had courage to do it because most judges wouldn't do it most judges would shy
[1:26:26.120 --> 1:26:30.680]  away because they know that when they make a strong decision they may never be appointed to a higher
[1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:35.960]  position they make themselves radioactive i have to take my hat off to the judge i've seen very few
[1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:41.960]  in my my career that had this courage and if you read the decision it's almost identical to what i
[1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:49.000]  argued in front of him on november 18th and you can see that transcript at w at the freedom watch
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:56.840]  usa.org this judge accepted what i said and what i told him was the judge you're the last century
[1:26:56.840 --> 1:27:05.000]  just the last hope of the american people to save off a revolution if you don't act if you don't stop
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:12.520]  this nsa spine on all americans and the coercion and the enslavement and the intimidation then the
[1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:17.000]  people are going to be in the streets ultimately and this is the worst violation of constitutional
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:22.760]  rights in american history we are not the soviet union we are not china we are the united states
[1:27:22.760 --> 1:27:27.880]  of america when you read the judge's decision and again he can find his freedom watch usa.org
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:35.240]  you'll see that he quotes madison and and sounding fathered and this is a great judge and
[1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:40.760]  there are very few in this country i would say 99 the judges this country would not have done what
[1:27:40.760 --> 1:27:49.240]  he did he's an american hero i agree with you now now expanding on this i'm not trying to rope you
[1:27:49.240 --> 1:27:53.800]  into the whole duck dynasty controversy but separately where do you stand with the so-called
[1:27:53.800 --> 1:27:58.440]  left always trying to shut down free speech the establishment left i mean they are really moving
[1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:05.080]  on every front to take down christmas trees crosses uh to anybody that mildly criticizes
[1:28:05.080 --> 1:28:10.360]  somebody's lifestyle to get them kicked off the air uh they wanted to shut your mic off because
[1:28:10.360 --> 1:28:15.320]  you wanted to defend yourself after they demonized you i mean i think we should stop calling them
[1:28:15.320 --> 1:28:24.120]  liberals or progressives these people are really kleptocratic con artists i never call them liberals
[1:28:24.120 --> 1:28:30.680]  because i you know i'm in europe liberal means conservative they're leftist left ultra leftist
[1:28:31.400 --> 1:28:37.640]  and and lemon you know where is it on its sleeve lemon is a racist but they could see that and
[1:28:38.440 --> 1:28:44.200]  the reality is the take a look at some of the comments about uh that white people in the
[1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:49.160]  republican party you know he grounded into me and that's the reality it's about time that we
[1:28:49.160 --> 1:28:54.360]  start talking clearly on the other side i believe civil rights i'm a civil rights lawyer that's what
[1:28:54.360 --> 1:29:01.480]  i am in effect and i believe that all people at jefferson rome are created equal but you know what
[1:29:02.120 --> 1:29:08.200]  conservatives are not equal anymore we're at the back of the box and we're taking a beating
[1:29:08.200 --> 1:29:13.640]  but you know what we have to put our neck out we can't be scared and and we have to do what we
[1:29:13.640 --> 1:29:20.600]  have to do and like our founding fathers it takes risking our lives we have to do it alec you know
[1:29:20.600 --> 1:29:27.160]  and i'm not afraid you're right you're right larry claiming good job freedom watch usa.org linked

[1:33:29.960 --> 1:33:37.800]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen and breaking up an info wars dot com from a hollywood
[1:33:37.800 --> 1:33:44.360]  reporter it's also up on drudge report dot com they say they will walk duck dynasty family
[1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:54.200]  we cannot imagine the show without phil robertson and they will walk and there's a photo of them
[1:33:54.200 --> 1:34:00.600]  with a bunch of chemtrails in the background part of the weather modification project that's
[1:34:00.600 --> 1:34:06.920]  declassified and going on but nobody will talk about that story is up on info wars dot com and
[1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:14.680]  is up on drudge report dot com and then up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[1:34:14.680 --> 1:34:21.080]  new facebook page boycott a and e support free speech we've watched that new facebook page
[1:34:21.800 --> 1:34:26.280]  and then that way folks we can really tell people what's going on with the anti free speech agenda
[1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:30.360]  it's not just a gay agenda being promoted it's setting the precedent to ban people's free speech
[1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:39.320]  in the name of civil rights it's an absolute abomination now there's another one out there
[1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:43.160]  that got launched yesterday we should have thought of this i should have thought of this
[1:34:43.160 --> 1:34:48.600]  has over a million likes we've got two thousand five hundred and seventeen we've got over two
[1:34:48.600 --> 1:34:53.320]  million likes on our other facebook pages got more than fifteen of them one of them's got six
[1:34:53.320 --> 1:34:57.560]  hundred almost seven hundred thousand we need everybody to go over and like this so it gets
[1:34:57.560 --> 1:35:02.920]  out to everybody because ours points out with camille padulia properly said and i think puts
[1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:08.040]  out even more first amendment information than the one that's got a million likes which again
[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:12.520]  i'm glad it's out there we just want to really have a page to educate people and bring them into
[1:35:12.520 --> 1:35:16.840]  the deeper knowledge of what this agenda is about because they can ban christmas trees and not let
[1:35:16.840 --> 1:35:22.200]  preachers you know speak out against homosexuality then there's no free speech for anybody and we
[1:35:22.200 --> 1:35:27.160]  point out if they can ban the bible in canada as they're now doing for preachers preaching from
[1:35:27.960 --> 1:35:31.720]  reading from leviticus and actually have the leviticus quote here with me we can put it on screen
[1:35:32.440 --> 1:35:38.200]  then they can ban the quran it says the same thing uh so this is the type of situation
[1:35:38.840 --> 1:35:44.440]  that we're talking about and it's info wars free speech on facebook or you can follow the link
[1:35:44.440 --> 1:35:54.120]  at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com so it is essential we ought to bomb google with a google
[1:35:54.120 --> 1:35:58.600]  bomb though they've got algorithms to block this now we can still do it just how about free speech
[1:35:58.600 --> 1:36:04.360]  everybody types free speech into the google search engine over and over and over and over again and
[1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:10.680]  make that the top term so that they get led back to everybody that's talking about free speech because
[1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:16.360]  that is a unifying situation across the board but this is a twitter bomb and a facebook bomb
[1:36:16.360 --> 1:36:25.160]  and we need your help to make it successful info wars.com prisonplanet.com go get the article
[1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:32.040]  new facebook page boycott a and e support free speech get it and send it out on your twitter
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:37.160]  retweet it from real alex jones get it out to everyone you know it is absolutely essential
[1:36:37.160 --> 1:36:45.400]  now uh again also uh they say the most popular voted on cnn thing of the year on pierce morgan
[1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:50.600]  was when i was on the show and it's now seen by even major gun grips is an iconic moment
[1:36:50.600 --> 1:36:54.840]  where the gauntlet was thrown down and go look you want to enslave us the government still got the
[1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:59.880]  guns and if you try to take them it's going to cause a revolution back off and many analysts
[1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:05.000]  they've had articles mark that point in the week after that when they began to lose the gun battle
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:09.960]  it isn't about the kids gun crimes down you know it you want to enslave us
[1:37:09.960 --> 1:37:13.480]  doesn't matter how many lemmings your brain wash we're not turning them in we will not relinquish
[1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:17.960]  them and that's how we got to respond to these people they tell you be timid lie down that it
[1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:22.280]  discredits you have your angry and focused and dominant no no no but then they're angry and
[1:37:22.280 --> 1:37:28.120]  focused and dominant when the cops come up and say don't don't protest disperse they talk like
[1:37:28.120 --> 1:37:33.480]  they're in charge the system talks like it's in charge it wants you to be a beta submissive
[1:37:33.480 --> 1:37:41.880]  to its illegitimate tyranny it's time to be alpha or you will be a slave the only person we should
[1:37:41.880 --> 1:37:47.320]  be subservient to is god and again you some of you atheists and folks don't have a god so it's
[1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:53.320]  materialism or yourself or the state most atheist i know my biggest beef with it is the is the state
[1:37:53.320 --> 1:37:59.880]  becomes your god well it's not my god and you cannot my religion all day but at least i follow
[1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:04.200]  what my ancestors followed at least i've got some continuity at least what i follow built modern
[1:38:04.200 --> 1:38:11.880]  civilization you can knock it all day at least i got something what do you got you don't know
[1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:18.360]  anything about what's happening that we only see a very narrow spectrum of light we only perceive
[1:38:18.360 --> 1:38:23.480]  a micron of reality the science now proves this most scientists genetic engineers dark matter
[1:38:23.480 --> 1:38:31.640]  astronomers are now becoming religious and i've had my own personal experiences ladies and gentlemen
[1:38:31.640 --> 1:38:36.360]  that i don't talk about it's like the fleet would match on yeah here they come the crystal
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:45.640]  visions i keep my visions to myself people have no idea what's going on in the real world how real
[1:38:45.640 --> 1:38:54.760]  all this is how do you know when you're out you can be standing in your own kitchen window
[1:38:55.800 --> 1:39:02.920]  facing a backyard of a of a empty house that hadn't been sold yet and you feel somebody
[1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:08.200]  looking at you and you look up and there's a meter reader for some reason staring right at you and
[1:39:08.200 --> 1:39:12.360]  they've made that connection they're sold to your soul and you pick up on it i can tell you how many
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:17.720]  times probably three four times that i've been on our own huge family ranch that you know thousands
[1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:26.840]  acres that we've had for since 1829 this was mexico's mexican land grant and i'll be out there
[1:39:26.840 --> 1:39:32.840]  seven three four times in the middle of nowhere in in when it's not even deer season there's no
[1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:36.440]  one out there i mean i'm we're not talking about fields folks the property we have left
[1:39:36.440 --> 1:39:40.520]  stuff that hadn't been sold off over the years to pay bills and debts and people get cancer or
[1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:45.080]  whatever or you know families have more sons they want a piece of it than they sell it it's pretty
[1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:49.960]  much woods it's it's wild and you'll be out in the middle of nowhere and i'll just feel somebody
[1:39:49.960 --> 1:39:56.120]  looking at me and turn and walk through the woods and through an opening and up in a tree some guy
[1:39:56.120 --> 1:40:00.920]  has got spikes on his feet and a 60 feet up in the air going hey how's it going i'm like
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:06.440]  you're your your number one you're poaching number two it's not even deer season and number three
[1:40:06.440 --> 1:40:12.280]  we don't have any people leasing this right now who are you oh i thought i was on yeah you you
[1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:17.800]  thought wrong you crossed the fence i'm going to turn around and i'm going to leave and i'm
[1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:22.920]  going to come back in about 10 minutes and if you're still up there i'm going to call the game
[1:40:22.920 --> 1:40:29.000]  warden or worse and then the guy goes okay and leaves that happened a couple other times
[1:40:29.720 --> 1:40:35.160]  where poachers have come in and then another time somebody was bow hunting on our property
[1:40:35.160 --> 1:40:39.720]  out front because we've got some acreage out front the ranch house most of our lands a couple miles
[1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:48.120]  away and i was out there with a rifle bow season was earlier and uh walking through the woods on
[1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:51.880]  the edge of a big cow pasture and felt somebody looking at me and and the fence is right there
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:56.280]  to some family man that owns the property next to it and i felt somebody looking at me back in the
[1:40:56.280 --> 1:41:00.680]  woods and i went back went through big oak tree guy up there going hey man what are you doing i'm
[1:41:00.680 --> 1:41:05.080]  paying to be here i'm bow hunting who are you i'm like oh i'm that's my cousin's property i was just
[1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:10.280]  i just felt somebody looking at me they're like yeah i know i can feel that too sometimes i was
[1:41:10.280 --> 1:41:18.200]  watching you out there one time i wrote a four-wheeler out and i was about 12 had stolen some of my
[1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:22.280]  grandmother's cigarettes and i was that's another time i just remembered and i felt somebody looking
[1:41:22.280 --> 1:41:27.160]  at me and again folks that's just a very small part of it i'm going to leave it at that i'll
[1:41:27.160 --> 1:41:30.840]  i'll tell you what most of you have experienced i'm not going to let the media try to discredit me
[1:41:30.840 --> 1:41:39.400]  with other stuff but it's it's pretty interesting to say the least but um there's a lot going on
[1:41:39.400 --> 1:41:43.880]  like they say in master and commander where uh you know the Jonas throws himself overboard
[1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:47.800]  and suddenly the wind comes back and he looks over and he says the doctor there's a lot going on
[1:41:47.800 --> 1:41:53.560]  that didn't in your books and he's paraphrasing another Shakespearean play i forget the exact quote
[1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:59.320]  but there's a lot happening now they went out there and it's usually crawling downtown
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:04.200]  around the capital in that area and it's lunchtime so there should be people out there
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:07.000]  and we do man on the street sometimes live on air we're going to be doing this more
[1:42:07.640 --> 1:42:11.160]  but there's no one out there it is a ghost town with jacari jackson
[1:42:11.160 --> 1:42:15.160]  and leon macadoo but i'm going to have them go downtown and do some interviews about hey do you
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:21.960]  think schools banning christmas trees and not letting kids hand out their own christmas cards
[1:42:21.960 --> 1:42:27.640]  is right when they say yeah i do or no i don't say well why when they say i do you know separation
[1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:32.680]  church take away the church there can't be one church over the school and one official religion
[1:42:32.680 --> 1:42:36.600]  that wouldn't be freedom but you can go with the christmas card and give it to anybody
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:41.240]  you could be a satanist and give somebody a card saying please come to our church of satan meetings
[1:42:42.040 --> 1:42:47.000]  all the drugs and sex you can handle but we want to abuse you and use you you know i mean the whole
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:53.560]  issue here is this is tyranny in the name of civil liberties and it ties into the duct dynasty it ties
[1:42:53.560 --> 1:42:58.680]  into the nsa it ties into the persecution of the press it ties into internet censorship the fairness
[1:42:58.680 --> 1:43:02.760]  doctrine all of it but they will get some mail on the street and have it on the nightly news tonight
[1:43:02.760 --> 1:43:10.280]  that leon macadoo is hosting and we take you now to leon and you're wearing a christmas cape there
[1:43:10.280 --> 1:43:14.280]  to be politically incorrect and you're there with a jacari who's got a red tie that's offensive
[1:43:14.280 --> 1:43:18.200]  because that could be back going i don't have a earpiece that could be associated with well she
[1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:21.560]  can ask questions for me because i know jacari wasn't going to be live with us but since there's
[1:43:21.560 --> 1:43:26.680]  nobody down there we'll we'll have him be interviewed by leon leon give us your take
[1:43:26.680 --> 1:43:32.280]  on the criminal offensive christmas tree that is behind you that we had to get a state law passed
[1:43:32.280 --> 1:43:38.360]  just to be able to have in front of the capital i mean that is so evil so nasty so bad i want you
[1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:42.840]  guys to walk over after you talk and actually give us an up close because i mean this is a
[1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:48.440]  talisman of wickedness and and and and hate speech of course there's a goddess you know the real god
[1:43:48.440 --> 1:43:55.160]  of that capital uh yoloja uh or is it diana's up on top of the capital but what is your take uh leon
[1:43:55.720 --> 1:44:02.440]  out there uh today on the attack on christmas well obviously the christmas tree behind me
[1:44:02.440 --> 1:44:08.040]  you can see it is extremely evil they've erected it behind me and they actually just started playing
[1:44:08.040 --> 1:44:13.960]  some demonic music from the tree i heard it it was a christmas carol yeah it was it was a christmas
[1:44:13.960 --> 1:44:19.560]  carol i heard it jingle bells i believe was the tune and uh extremely offensive but that's why i
[1:44:19.560 --> 1:44:26.040]  wanted to come out here today dressed as uh saint nicolas to just express my gratitude to the state
[1:44:26.040 --> 1:44:32.360]  for granting me the privilege to express my first amendment right to practice freedom of religion
[1:44:32.360 --> 1:44:39.400]  and you know where christmas colors dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh
[1:44:39.400 --> 1:44:49.000]  through the fields we go laughing all the way oh my gosh that's terrorism singing voice absolutely
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:54.360]  ask chicari his take on the thought crime he's involved in where do you do you feel okay with
[1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:59.160]  all this thought crime that you're involved in out here on the street no i mean because jesus
[1:44:59.160 --> 1:45:04.440]  is the reason for the season and as much as i don't really like rick perry you know he's forcing
[1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:07.880]  garter sale and little girls and calling it the law he at least said that you can call christmas
[1:45:07.880 --> 1:45:11.960]  christmas so i give him credit what credit is due but just to say that you're involved in thought
[1:45:11.960 --> 1:45:16.040]  crime for wanting to celebrate christmas or if you want to stand up for your religious beliefs
[1:45:16.040 --> 1:45:20.840]  and you know they want to demonize you for that that's completely wrong yeah exactly it's it's our
[1:45:20.840 --> 1:45:25.960]  right it's our first amendment right so why did we need to go past legislation and get permission
[1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:30.280]  from the government to allow us to do this without the threat of being sued for wearing
[1:45:30.280 --> 1:45:35.560]  red or green at school or giving christmas cards out or candy canes to your friends
[1:45:35.560 --> 1:45:42.840]  it's ridiculous well i tell you i don't know um pierce morgan he says the first amendment
[1:45:42.840 --> 1:45:47.960]  shouldn't protect vile bigots like phil robertson i thought the first amendment protected everybody
[1:45:47.960 --> 1:45:52.680]  as long as you didn't call for violence against somebody well i mean it's there but you've got
[1:45:52.680 --> 1:45:58.280]  to have explicit explicit permission from the government i mean they have to then say yes hey

[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:18.600]  it is real so when did america become the soviet union we were actually just granted
[1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:23.240]  the privilege to practice our first amendment right of freedom of religion and stuff by allowing
[1:48:23.240 --> 1:48:28.920]  the christmas tree and christmas colors do you think that's just insane are you working canada
[1:48:28.920 --> 1:48:34.520]  well this is what happens here well i mean ask him if they're allowed to have it in canada
[1:48:34.520 --> 1:48:38.840]  are you allowed to celebrate christmas freely in canada or do you have to ask permission
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:43.880]  no our charter guarantees religious freedom you can basically do whatever you want first we only
[1:48:43.880 --> 1:48:49.080]  got a constitution in 1982 so you know ours is pretty young still we were a little more modern
[1:48:49.080 --> 1:48:54.680]  when we drafted it you guys are still working on the you know 1860 copy yeah 1982 was you know
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:49:00.040]  yeah they're continually trying to ours is the model dummy ours is the model and what do you think
[1:49:00.040 --> 1:49:05.160]  about that children here in school aren't being allowed to wear red or green or bring candy canes
[1:49:05.160 --> 1:49:11.160]  to their friends is this a joke oh no that's real we just had to actually uh tell about the christmas
[1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:16.680]  cards not not allowed evil not allowed to have christmas cards or christmas carols and our governor
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:22.040]  just signed legislation called the merry christmas law that'll protect us from being sued for being
[1:49:22.040 --> 1:49:25.800]  out here and offending people i don't know that's it's different canada you're allowed to do that
[1:49:25.800 --> 1:49:29.880]  stuff you wouldn't be allowed to you can't have school prayer in public schools i don't know if
[1:49:29.880 --> 1:49:35.080]  you guys allow that uh we don't allow like um i don't explain to him that they're violating
[1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:41.640]  individual prayer but that's really just as far as that goes is is is school prayer really but
[1:49:41.640 --> 1:49:46.600]  you can you can bring christmas cards or anything and we usually celebrate like try to well do a
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:51.080]  jewish thing yeah right well we do that here too but it's it's basically like as the school can't
[1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:57.400]  say hey you've got to say this prayer or do that but you as an individual can freely pray or do whatever
[1:49:57.400 --> 1:50:02.520]  and they're trying to ban that they're trying to ban that obviously for certain religions specifically
[1:50:02.520 --> 1:50:08.040]  christianity they're not going to uh tell someone who practices you know islam that they can't go and
[1:50:08.040 --> 1:50:12.520]  practice their religion four or five times a day what do you think about that yeah this whole thing
[1:50:12.520 --> 1:50:19.960]  is just wacky pretty much yeah the canadians have spoken thanks guys all right great job canadians
[1:50:19.960 --> 1:50:24.520]  well looks like they think more freely than the average soviet uh we're going to go to break
[1:50:24.520 --> 1:50:29.160]  real fast and then find some more folks to talk to chicari what's your take on those men what's your
[1:50:29.160 --> 1:50:34.360]  take on these meetings i'm glad to see that these guys uh you know are at least aware of this now
[1:50:34.360 --> 1:50:37.480]  and they said you know it's completely ridiculous they couldn't believe that this actually happened
[1:50:37.480 --> 1:50:41.320]  they said is this a joke they couldn't believe it and you know just like they were saying that
[1:50:41.320 --> 1:50:46.280]  they have freedom religion we do too in theory you know but you know you have to ask permission to
[1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:50.600]  practice your religion that's right we look we're going to exercise our rights so they can't take
[1:50:50.600 --> 1:50:57.160]  them period they're a bunch of authoritarian scum and we are going to get back in their face and not

[1:56:34.920 --> 1:56:40.440]  do you want to apologize to people for being by the territory i just asked this gentleman and he
[1:56:40.440 --> 1:56:46.600]  told me that he's jewish and he isn't offended by this by this christmas tree i really want to
[1:56:46.600 --> 1:56:51.560]  find it very nice yeah because it's a free country right what do you think about here in america they
[1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:57.320]  are not allowing uh kids to go to school dressed in red or green they can't bring christmas cards
[1:56:57.880 --> 1:57:02.840]  they're uh banning it from schools yeah well i'm good in a way yeah i'm i'm i'm fine i'm fine with
[1:57:02.840 --> 1:57:08.920]  that yeah if i've if i've been asked i'm fine with that yes okay see there you have it they are not
[1:57:08.920 --> 1:57:13.800]  terrorized by this christmas tree it is not a frightening thing here ask his wife if she's got
[1:57:13.800 --> 1:57:18.760]  anything to say do you have anything to say about uh the state of it's a free country everybody can
[1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:26.040]  do whatever they want to very california yes yeah all right awesome it's a free country here all right
[1:57:26.040 --> 1:57:30.680]  there you go i mean everybody recognizes this is tyranny i mean if i was in a muslim country and
[1:57:30.680 --> 1:57:34.600]  they were having a holiday i wouldn't say change that i'm offended you can say well we're a country
[1:57:34.600 --> 1:57:39.400]  of everything yeah but christmas if you're gonna have it it is christmas uh leon will you please
[1:57:39.400 --> 1:57:45.800]  have josh show us the terroristry please uh yes you're behind me you can see it's extraordinarily
[1:57:45.800 --> 1:57:52.440]  offensive and of course now you're marching towards the capital itself that has masonic regalia
[1:57:52.440 --> 1:57:56.440]  all over it and everybody better be careful or they're gonna make everybody take that down as
[1:57:56.440 --> 1:58:01.640]  well i wonder if folks know what a woman holding a star that's actually the goddess columbia up there
[1:58:01.640 --> 1:58:07.320]  uh what they think of that religious iconography leon what do you think of the goddess up there
[1:58:08.600 --> 1:58:12.440]  well i think she's you know i think she's pretty beautiful but i don't know the whole background
[1:58:12.440 --> 1:58:18.840]  of it so are you offended by her you know at times i think she's holding the the star above the tree
[1:58:18.840 --> 1:58:23.080]  which is kind of reminiscent to how they'll have you know the other angels holding the star above
[1:58:23.080 --> 1:58:27.960]  the tree so that's probably offensive they should probably take that down that's right we need to
[1:58:27.960 --> 1:58:32.360]  sign a petition to have them actually take it down and break it in little pieces no actually it's
[1:58:32.360 --> 1:58:36.840]  just it just means good luck the guardian goddess over things stay there i want to come back and get
[1:58:38.040 --> 1:58:45.720]  a jacarys take as well with you leon stay there go up by the capital thanks this is gcn the genesis

[2:01:45.080 --> 2:01:52.280]  no we usually don't we usually just go there and have the party so you can't bring christmas cards

[2:02:12.840 --> 2:02:19.000]  the background there's a cannon a symbol of of revolution that's uh that's even worse i mean
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:25.160]  oh i'm offended by that we've got to do i might go ask these gentlemen if they still believe that
[2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:30.360]  they're living in a free country they're actually fans of the cannon there i don't know if they
[2:02:30.360 --> 2:02:34.440]  understand the symbolism of that uh freedom let me get a final comment from chicory and then
[2:02:34.440 --> 2:02:40.120]  walk over to those guys chicory what do you think about these thought criminals oh well you know
[2:02:40.120 --> 2:02:45.400]  they start young and these guys are well on their way to being some hardcore extremists
[2:02:45.400 --> 2:02:51.080]  believing that they have a first amendment right in this country well there's the headline school
[2:02:51.080 --> 2:02:56.040]  bands display of christmas posted by a student because it might be religious again you can
[2:02:56.040 --> 2:03:02.120]  have your own individual art you put out and that display is not church and state let's
[2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:06.520]  march over to uh those thought criminals by the cannon and see if they think it should be banned
[2:03:06.520 --> 2:03:13.160]  as well as offensive chicory uh here we go uh chicory jackson leon macadoo out there and they're
[2:03:13.160 --> 2:03:17.640]  gonna shoot some more reports and more interviews and high death out there but look at skype looks

[2:03:33.480 --> 2:03:39.160]  good they know not to talk in america yeah people are okay with mass surveillance as long as the
[2:03:39.160 --> 2:03:44.920]  cameras aren't right in their face yeah well they'd rather imagine they're not there leon leon any
[2:03:44.920 --> 2:03:50.040]  other points you'd like to make and then final words from uh jackson well it seems to me like
[2:03:50.040 --> 2:03:55.960]  everyone out here is just kind of in the christmas spirit and no one seems to be offended by the tree
[2:03:55.960 --> 2:04:01.080]  they weren't they were a little frightened of me and my uh chris my chris kringle outfit but i think
[2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:06.680]  overall it's it's a win for freedom what do you think chicory last word i think it is a win for
[2:04:06.680 --> 2:04:10.200]  freedom to see people actually care about their rights and are willing to stand up for them
[2:04:10.200 --> 2:04:13.800]  even if it has to get to the point where it's their religious freedoms if that's their line i'm
[2:04:13.800 --> 2:04:17.400]  glad if they have sure sure what's that democrat's name that wants to abort all the babies they haven't
[2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:22.760]  paid for by the government her name's uh debbie something why don't you guys yeah what's her name

[2:08:53.240 --> 2:09:01.240]  jones ladies and gentlemen we are back live thank you uh so much for joining us and we are seeing
[2:09:01.240 --> 2:09:07.960]  incredible censorship of the press we are seeing just amazing religious persecution in this country
[2:09:07.960 --> 2:09:15.800]  what camille paglia called the latest duck dynasty censorship fascist and ultra stylistic
[2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:23.720]  we are seeing the name of political correctness soviet style attacks on the first amendment
[2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:28.120]  and we defend the first amendment the fourth amendment the second amendment the tenth amendment
[2:09:28.120 --> 2:09:37.880]  we defend it all and we defend it all across the board as best we can that's why we go out and
[2:09:37.880 --> 2:09:42.200]  demonstrate when they ban protesting or free speech at the fifth anniversary of kennedy's
[2:09:42.200 --> 2:09:47.240]  assassination that's why we go to the nsa building and protest what they're doing in utah or in san
[2:09:47.240 --> 2:09:54.840]  antonio and that's why we have people like amber lyon on the broadcast because she really is a hero
[2:09:55.960 --> 2:10:01.320]  she was making a lot of money was successful had won three Emmys for journalism
[2:10:01.320 --> 2:10:10.920]  and for stories and best camera talent reported she covered all sorts of war zones and the BP
[2:10:10.920 --> 2:10:15.800]  oil spill you name it and then when there were western back countries in the middle east killing
[2:10:15.800 --> 2:10:19.640]  men women and children and she was going to do reports on that she got censored and told she
[2:10:19.640 --> 2:10:24.360]  couldn't and the reports got killed you know that she was there and at the video risking her
[2:10:24.360 --> 2:10:31.400]  life and in others and then she learned that these governments were paying in some cases 400 000
[2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:38.040]  dollars to kill each episode so cnn was almost using her journalism as behind the scenes a blackmail
[2:10:38.040 --> 2:10:42.680]  tool is really what's going on now cnn said she left is imploding into an entertainment channel
[2:10:43.400 --> 2:10:48.520]  here's morgan had votes last night by his viewers and they found that my appearance on his show was
[2:10:48.520 --> 2:10:55.960]  the highlight of the year and it's because it broke with the script and joining us from australia
[2:10:56.920 --> 2:11:02.680]  on the international book tour for her new book peace love and pepper spray the big coffee table
[2:11:02.680 --> 2:11:09.080]  book full of photos but also blurbs and articles is peace love and pepper spray and when you buy
[2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:14.360]  it we're not selling it we should be you are supporting true independent journalism and while
[2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:20.920]  she talks we'll flip through some of it on the air for you so you can see some of what she covers in
[2:11:20.920 --> 2:11:27.720]  here but she gets into a whole area of pre-revolutionary protest whiskey rebellion slave
[2:11:27.720 --> 2:11:35.000]  rebellions the labor movement women's suffrage civil rights and then she moves into what's
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:40.920]  happening today the vietnam war kent state gay rights and then pepper sprayed a tale of two
[2:11:40.920 --> 2:11:47.240]  two i mean this is just a really powerful book i couldn't put it down when i started looking at
[2:11:47.240 --> 2:11:52.600]  it today before uh before the show and regardless of what you think about it it's a celebration of
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:12:01.400]  the first amendment a celebration of journalism and cuts across political lines so amber lion live
[2:12:01.400 --> 2:12:07.240]  dot com is the site amber so good for you to stay up late i mean what time is it five six o'clock
[2:12:07.240 --> 2:12:14.120]  in the morning in australia yeah it's really early it's about five a.m or six a.m here now alex
[2:12:14.120 --> 2:12:17.960]  thank you so much for having me on it was worth waking up for well it's always good to see your
[2:12:17.960 --> 2:12:22.600]  beaming face and spirit well you've got the floor tell us about what you're doing what you've been
[2:12:22.600 --> 2:12:26.440]  through since you were on with us six months ago or so and i know you were going to be on the
[2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:31.000]  nightly news tonight as well but i mean just looking at all the things that are happening
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:36.840]  and the world and the nsa and just all of it coming out uh just give us your take on the world
[2:12:36.840 --> 2:12:43.320]  in general well right now i think the world is waking up we're seeing an expanded consciousness
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:49.320]  worldwide that really ha fills me with a lot of hope especially when you saw the american people
[2:12:49.320 --> 2:12:54.840]  and the people worldwide stand up and say enough is enough and and we don't want this attack on
[2:12:54.840 --> 2:13:00.920]  syria to me that was emblematic of a shift in consciousness we're facing worldwide and something
[2:13:00.920 --> 2:13:07.080]  that can make all of us smile a little bit because the people are waking up and since we last spoke
[2:13:07.080 --> 2:13:12.440]  alex i just been working on this book and and i spent a crazy but exciting journey and i think
[2:13:12.440 --> 2:13:17.720]  the book is super important because i saw that the mainstream media was demonizing protest
[2:13:17.720 --> 2:13:22.760]  and making people think that protesters didn't have a sound message and protest was a waste of
[2:13:22.760 --> 2:13:27.720]  time and i published this book to remind the american people that protest has been the common
[2:13:27.720 --> 2:13:33.800]  denominator for change throughout history and if we don't want things if we want things to change
[2:13:33.800 --> 2:13:40.120]  we're going to have to stand up and and fight for our rights alex well you're absolutely right amber
[2:13:40.120 --> 2:13:44.760]  and i know that that since you've been homeless you've been traveling the world and and and doing
[2:13:44.760 --> 2:13:50.440]  investigative journalism uh and in some dangerous situations uh tell us about some of your latest
[2:13:50.440 --> 2:13:58.600]  exploits well i uh as of now i've been traveling investigating natural medicines um i i feel like
[2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:04.280]  a lot of these medicines are being um demonized and not only that they're being withheld from the
[2:14:04.280 --> 2:14:09.800]  american public and what i consider to be one of the greatest human rights tragedies of our generation
[2:14:09.800 --> 2:14:16.520]  and so i've been uh since march of last year i've literally been on the road non-stop investigating
[2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:21.960]  these medicines and i'm currently writing a book for people to show them how they can access them
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:27.800]  instead of just relying on prescription drugs which are as you know alex you talk about this a
[2:14:27.800 --> 2:14:33.400]  lot on your show uh turning the nation into zombies and and addicts as well one of my last
[2:14:33.400 --> 2:14:40.440]  stories i did for cnn was on these babies being born addicted to prescription medications this
[2:14:40.440 --> 2:14:47.160]  nicu in east tennessee literally had to build an extra wing just to handle all these babies being
[2:14:47.160 --> 2:14:51.320]  born addicted and that's a story that's not being covered enough as well that i'm going to be covering
[2:14:51.320 --> 2:14:56.840]  in the in the book too well but in addition to that i i finished up covering protests across the
[2:14:56.840 --> 2:15:02.760]  u.s i traveled uh the u.s for a year covering the occupied protests covering teacher protest
[2:15:02.760 --> 2:15:08.680]  home foreclosure protests really just any uh event where the little guy was standing up for his rights
[2:15:08.680 --> 2:15:15.000]  talk to us about the nature of where you see the first amendment as an award-winning journalist
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:20.520]  who's trained in understanding it with the way the free speech zones operate the way the riot
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:25.880]  police operate um the way this culture is converting to what we see in third world countries and
[2:15:25.880 --> 2:15:30.600]  dictatorships quite frankly but they're still branding it as freedom uh because we went up to
[2:15:30.600 --> 2:15:35.400]  cover you know jfk and we're totally peaceful and we're physically attacked punched hit uh you name
[2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:39.320]  it for peacefully being there the dallas police said no you're ever right to be here first amendment
[2:15:39.320 --> 2:15:44.760]  and then the feds had the uh deputized sheriff's deputies physically attack us and they looked
[2:15:44.760 --> 2:15:51.480]  like people out of central casting from them from a uh maximum security prison who did attack us
[2:15:51.480 --> 2:15:55.880]  and it's just you don't want to think bad of the police you want to believe in the system
[2:15:55.880 --> 2:16:01.800]  but when it becomes tyrannical in your face you're a fool to deny it so your book incredible photo
[2:16:01.800 --> 2:16:10.760]  journalism in here uh and and first hand accounts uh that it goes through talk about the state of
[2:16:10.760 --> 2:16:15.160]  the first amendment in this country well it's a disturbing state right now alex like you were
[2:16:15.160 --> 2:16:21.480]  described and we're seeing a rampant amount of police militarization to the point that people
[2:16:21.480 --> 2:16:26.760]  are being intimidated to even hit the streets and protest uh one of the protests i covered in the book
[2:16:26.760 --> 2:16:32.440]  the anaheim police brutality protest ironically enough um the people were protesting against
[2:16:32.440 --> 2:16:38.920]  police brutality when the police started opening fire on crowds of women and children using less
[2:16:38.920 --> 2:16:43.720]  lethal rounds which we all know can be lethal if they hit you in the head or in the wrong location
[2:16:43.720 --> 2:16:48.760]  and i was even fired at by the anaheim police department as i was standing in the middle of a
[2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:56.280]  busy street photographing a dumpster that had been set on fire a wall of police started firing up on me
[2:16:56.280 --> 2:17:01.400]  and i i had to run i was in such shock because as you mentioned alex i have traveled all around
[2:17:01.400 --> 2:17:07.400]  the world covering protests in in countries that we consider to be run by dictators and we consider
[2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:13.000]  to be more dangerous than the u.s but i have never been directly shot at like that in my entire career
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:19.400]  and i was just in shock and i had to run between two trucks to avoid being hit and when i emerged
[2:17:19.400 --> 2:17:23.960]  from the truck screaming press one of the officers said to me don't you know how to cover a protest
[2:17:23.960 --> 2:17:28.520]  you need to stand back here and you pointed behind the police line where all the other journalists
[2:17:28.520 --> 2:17:33.480]  were corralled and i believe i was fired upon because they didn't want me out there documenting
[2:17:33.480 --> 2:17:39.080]  these injuries i had uh photographs of pedestrians who'd been hit in the back of their legs with these
[2:17:39.080 --> 2:17:43.960]  projectiles and not only that one of the next days when the protesters hit the streets police
[2:17:43.960 --> 2:17:50.520]  showed up dressed in full camo gear alex i just that was another double take i had to do i felt
[2:17:50.520 --> 2:17:57.320]  like i was in egypt they were wearing camouflage clothing and um and camo uh and military boots
[2:17:57.880 --> 2:18:03.400]  and and heavily armed for a protest that it was almost a joke like you either had to laugh or cry
[2:18:03.400 --> 2:18:10.200]  because this protest consisted mostly of his spanish women and and children who were unarmed
[2:18:11.240 --> 2:18:15.080]  it's it's we're just seeing a disturbing rate of this police militarization and i definitely
[2:18:15.080 --> 2:18:20.760]  exposed that in the book because it just became a common thread at all of these protests alex and
[2:18:20.760 --> 2:18:26.120]  people like to believe we have the freedom uh to exercise our first amendment rights in the united
[2:18:26.120 --> 2:18:33.400]  states but when you have police directly intimidating protesters then we're not able to do so and and
[2:18:33.400 --> 2:18:38.600]  i know a lot of police are are good you know police officers many of them do get in the field
[2:18:38.600 --> 2:18:43.080]  to protect our freedoms but they're doing the exact opposite and as a failure that's right the
[2:18:43.080 --> 2:18:48.120]  directive from on top is towards authoritarianism and as you know our government and the special
[2:18:48.120 --> 2:18:53.560]  interests that control it are on record all over the world trying to put authoritarian regimes in
[2:18:53.560 --> 2:18:57.720]  because they want to manage and extract the resources they're treating us exactly the same
[2:18:57.720 --> 2:19:06.120]  so this is a top-down operation exactly and and why we're see outrage alex like why this is what i
[2:19:06.120 --> 2:19:11.560]  don't understand why why aren't the people saying enough is enough and really standing up and fighting
[2:19:11.560 --> 2:19:17.800]  back against this police militarization this is a slippery slope and and we're seeing this i mean
[2:19:17.800 --> 2:19:23.640]  even from when i started covering the protest in september 2011 to now look at the change in the
[2:19:23.640 --> 2:19:29.240]  police attire police are now heading to these protests just dressed like they're in some
[2:19:29.240 --> 2:19:34.920]  judge-dread movie and and and i think they're doing that because they're they're getting away
[2:19:34.920 --> 2:19:41.080]  with it the american public is is allowing this to happen and sitting back and and not standing up for
[2:19:41.080 --> 2:19:48.200]  our rights now amber when we come back i want to get into some of the big breaking news of the nsa

[2:23:57.800 --> 2:24:07.800]  what
[2:24:15.560 --> 2:24:20.520]  think about this we're about to have our reporters in about 15 minutes with amberline as well via
[2:24:20.520 --> 2:24:26.840]  australia go in and ask some of the state reps if they support texas schools banning christmas cards
[2:24:26.840 --> 2:24:31.240]  basically of any type being handed out again that's free individual will to hand out a christmas
[2:24:31.240 --> 2:24:35.320]  card it's not the school saying here's our official religion this is real tyranny folks
[2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:43.560]  and so they're going to be inside the capital via skype crystal clear we're talking to amber
[2:24:43.560 --> 2:24:49.720]  lion award-winning journalist and has her new book out peace love and pepper spray from australia
[2:24:50.680 --> 2:24:55.640]  this is really the future because they can use all this technology here's a new york times article
[2:24:55.640 --> 2:25:01.400]  breaking it down to surveil us and control us but if we use the technology to empower real media
[2:25:01.960 --> 2:25:07.240]  and to take action there's nothing they can do because there's billions of us and only a few
[2:25:07.240 --> 2:25:13.160]  thousand top globalist and a few tens of millions of their minions worldwide nsa dragnet includes
[2:25:13.160 --> 2:25:20.120]  allies aid groups and business elite i was told by nsa whistleblowers over a decade ago that it's
[2:25:20.120 --> 2:25:25.240]  mainly to steal technological information from other companies and give it to globalist companies
[2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:29.320]  not american companies and the white house has been forced to come out and admit a lot of this
[2:25:29.320 --> 2:25:33.400]  to take the sting out of all the info that's beginning to come out so going back to amber
[2:25:33.400 --> 2:25:38.280]  lion amber where are you specifically in australia right now um i'm in sydney
[2:25:39.720 --> 2:25:44.440]  how incredible is it that you can be in australia i can be here in australia and i've got reporters
[2:25:44.440 --> 2:25:50.040]  on the street i mean if the citizens start using this and seeing themselves as important which they
[2:25:50.040 --> 2:25:56.440]  are uh it's over most the news we end up breaking now comes from our listeners mainstream media
[2:25:56.440 --> 2:26:00.520]  doesn't even know how to do that so how are you as a professional journalist now as a guerrilla
[2:26:00.520 --> 2:26:06.760]  journalist how do you see that fusing together in the future well are you talking about the ability
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:11.640]  to use you know report news on your cell phone just everything i mean what do you see this this
[2:26:11.640 --> 2:26:16.760]  revolution i don't see the establishment being able to control it no i don't think so either and i
[2:26:16.760 --> 2:26:20.600]  think they're they're shaking in their boots it's it's quite disturbing for them that they can't
[2:26:20.600 --> 2:26:26.280]  control it anymore and i think syria it was the perfect example of that and that's where
[2:26:26.280 --> 2:26:31.080]  social media spread the truth about what was happening on the ground in syria and and it
[2:26:31.080 --> 2:26:37.480]  spreads so rapidly across the tentacles of the web that uh the elite's narrative wasn't accepted
[2:26:37.480 --> 2:26:42.760]  by the public and and the public stood up and said we're not going to enter and as far as just
[2:26:42.760 --> 2:26:48.360]  social media in general as a journalist i always tell journalism students i'm so jealous of of
[2:26:48.360 --> 2:26:53.320]  these young journalists is getting into the field right now because they have so much power all you
[2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:58.440]  need to do is is set up a website and and have a you know even a just a cell phone camera and
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:03.480]  take donations off your website and you can bypass the dinosaur gatekeepers of the media
[2:27:04.200 --> 2:27:09.080]  and have your own success and we've seen a lot of journalists do that as well um one of them who's
[2:27:09.080 --> 2:27:16.760]  doing it very well is uh you know not only you alex also uh the journalists have just taken it into
[2:27:16.760 --> 2:27:21.080]  their own hands to to create their own entity online and that used to be nearly impossible
[2:27:21.080 --> 2:27:25.400]  because you had all these gatekeepers really controlling the message so uh for me this all
[2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:31.240]  gives me a lot of hope because the people are taking at the power and we're we're seeing this
[2:27:31.240 --> 2:27:36.760]  happen at a rate that they cannot be controlled anymore you're right i want to shift gears and
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:41.880]  talk about free speech with you whether you agree with what the duck dynasty uh patriarch said
[2:27:42.840 --> 2:27:49.080]  or whether you uh disagree or whether you're agree i mean it doesn't matter for me the fact is he
[2:27:49.080 --> 2:27:53.400]  said it in a magazine interview and now they've kicked him off the show and it's the same thing
[2:27:53.400 --> 2:27:57.480]  with the christmas cards kids should be able to hand out christmas cards that's their personal
[2:27:57.480 --> 2:28:03.000]  free speech and i really see out of the so-called left more and more authoritarianism i'm just a
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:07.560]  libertarian and i see in your book you know the story of people on the left and the right being
[2:28:07.560 --> 2:28:12.920]  abused but are you are you concerned about out of control political correctness or what is your
[2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:19.560]  view on the duck dynasty controversy well i think that anytime that someone is is censored because
[2:28:19.560 --> 2:28:26.040]  of their beliefs that i don't accept it especially as a journalist who was who was censored um you
[2:28:26.040 --> 2:28:31.560]  know you're just seeing the corporate control of the media and it's really just making it so it's
[2:28:31.560 --> 2:28:37.240]  just dumbing down society because anytime anyone speaks anything politically uh they're censored
[2:28:37.240 --> 2:28:42.280]  and not only that it sends a chilling effect across all of these shows well that's right and
[2:28:42.280 --> 2:28:47.720]  it's left right center libertarian anything that's pertinent anything that makes waves they shut it
[2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:51.960]  down and they can say well we own the printing press yeah but they got it through fraud through
[2:28:51.960 --> 2:28:57.400]  collusion and it's so centralized and then they're trying to create a chilling effect like with you
[2:28:57.400 --> 2:29:01.640]  i mean you exposed war crimes and then they blocked it and then you learned they've been paid off
[2:29:03.240 --> 2:29:07.880]  exactly and that was very disturbing for me as a journalist because at one end of the building
[2:29:07.880 --> 2:29:13.400]  my crew and i were risking our lives to expose this brutal regime and then at the under the other
[2:29:13.400 --> 2:29:18.040]  end of the building cnn was taking money from them in exchange for producing these positive
[2:29:18.040 --> 2:29:23.720]  programmings that made the regime look um look like they were democratic and really helping the
[2:29:23.720 --> 2:29:29.000]  people win what we saw on the ground was the exact opposite and and i and i believe alex that that's
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:34.280]  happening across the board within the corporate press especially because after uh i exposed what
[2:29:34.280 --> 2:29:39.720]  was happening at cnn i didn't get much mainstream coverage which was kind of for me indicative of
[2:29:39.720 --> 2:29:45.000]  the fact that a lot of these still there we're gonna come back and talk about that with our guests
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:56.520]  straight ahead amber lion we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[2:34:42.520 --> 2:34:46.760]  CNN and basically pressured to leave but she left i guess on her own accord she can remind me of
[2:34:46.760 --> 2:34:52.120]  i'm wrong but i'm going from memory for for going to battle zones and seeing western backed regimes
[2:34:52.120 --> 2:34:57.240]  killing men women and children she had the footage it later came out that it was true and then she
[2:34:57.240 --> 2:35:02.440]  later learned that those governments were literally what was it 400 and what thousand dollars being
[2:35:02.440 --> 2:35:06.840]  paid to sing an end to spike your story i mean that's incredible recap that briefly because it's so
[2:35:06.840 --> 2:35:12.840]  important and and then i want to tie it into uh all the things we see happening today and
[2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:19.240]  where you see this going well seen and never gave i even requested to get an amount of money
[2:35:19.240 --> 2:35:24.440]  that they are getting paid by the Bahrain Economic Development Board and they never revealed that i
[2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:29.640]  don't know where the 400 000 figure comes from but um as far as my reporting goes we we weren't
[2:35:29.640 --> 2:35:35.480]  able to reveal an exact amount but we did find out that CNN was getting paid by the Bahrain regime
[2:35:35.480 --> 2:35:43.080]  and not only by Bahrain but by regimes worldwide in exchange for producing positive content disguised
[2:35:43.080 --> 2:35:48.600]  as news that they sprinkled into their regular programming with little or no disclosure to viewers
[2:35:48.600 --> 2:35:55.480]  and not only little or no disclosure to viewers but no disclosure to CNN's own reporters and um
[2:35:55.480 --> 2:36:01.160]  so what happened is i had gone to Bahrain to cover the uprising there and we discovered some uh
[2:36:01.160 --> 2:36:06.520]  uncovered some pretty brutal crimes by that regime that's being backed by the U.S. and when
[2:36:06.520 --> 2:36:12.440]  i got back to the United States at first i was able to go on CNN and report on what was happening
[2:36:12.440 --> 2:36:18.840]  and then it became uh i had more and more red tape go up it became nearly impossible to get
[2:36:18.840 --> 2:36:25.880]  stories on about Bahrain and our documentary on the Arab Spring and the Bahrain Revolution which
[2:36:25.880 --> 2:36:31.960]  was the most one of the most damning reports against this regime to date never aired on CNN
[2:36:31.960 --> 2:36:38.360]  international and after some uh prompting by executives who wrote me and said that you should
[2:36:38.360 --> 2:36:44.280]  investigate this that something suspicious is going on uh we were able to uncover that as
[2:36:44.280 --> 2:36:49.080]  CNN had been getting paid by Bahrain Bahrain was a paying customer there uh for years
[2:36:49.080 --> 2:36:56.680]  yeah i saw a news story where it came out and that's where i get that memory of one of those
[2:36:56.680 --> 2:37:02.200]  governments it was 400 plus thousand for some of the PR stuff and it's again CNN is not disclosing
[2:37:02.200 --> 2:37:08.520]  this and now i see the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on ABC News the London Guardian uh
[2:37:08.520 --> 2:37:16.680]  CNN we're on the site it will say uh this week on ABC News brought to you by the Bill and Melinda
[2:37:16.680 --> 2:37:21.880]  Gates Foundation but you watch it it's their whole agenda during the show never telling you that
[2:37:22.440 --> 2:37:27.400]  and it just shows the propaganda placement is getting worse and worse and that was the problem
[2:37:27.400 --> 2:37:35.800]  at CNN is that they have been taking money from Kazakhstan, the Ukraine, Nigeria, Lebanon, Bahrain
[2:37:35.800 --> 2:37:42.520]  and they've been just sprinkling these uh programs that they were paid by these regimes to create
[2:37:42.520 --> 2:37:47.880]  into the regular news programming so with little or no disclosure to viewers so the average viewer
[2:37:47.880 --> 2:37:52.360]  would probably have no idea there while i'm watching a sponsored segment and that to me was
[2:37:52.360 --> 2:37:57.480]  what i found the most disturbing not only that as a journalist that i wasn't told that uh that the
[2:37:57.480 --> 2:38:03.160]  regime i was investigating was also a paying customer at the network and so above all i think
[2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:09.480]  we're having a little bit of a disconnect with these networks Alex as to what is true journalism
[2:38:09.480 --> 2:38:15.560]  journalism is printing what someone else doesn't want printed everything else is public relations
[2:38:15.560 --> 2:38:21.320]  and we're just seeing too much public real style and advertising mix in the mix and it
[2:38:21.320 --> 2:38:26.200]  makes it very difficult to trust these networks for an accurate picture of what's happening overseas
[2:38:26.200 --> 2:38:31.560]  not only overseas but in the u.s and i have an article here out of Reuters super bug bacteria
[2:38:31.560 --> 2:38:36.760]  widespread in u.s chicken consumer group and that a lot of people are getting sick from it
[2:38:36.760 --> 2:38:41.240]  so if you have some little plant that has salmonella and gets a few people sick they'll shut it down
[2:38:41.240 --> 2:38:46.600]  but big aggregate to radiate it they get to spray all these special chemicals on them and it turns
[2:38:46.600 --> 2:38:51.640]  out it's not just governments out of the top 100 economies over 50 of them are corporations not
[2:38:51.640 --> 2:38:57.000]  governments they're all in there it turned out with fox over a decade ago making payoffs and
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:03.240]  advertising to not let local fox reporters in florida do a report on studies of what the synthetic
[2:39:03.240 --> 2:39:08.280]  growth hormone was doing to people i mean no kidding it was making kids grow weird no no
[2:39:08.280 --> 2:39:14.440]  kidding it was making people go into puberty early and they got shut down and so it's just
[2:39:14.440 --> 2:39:19.480]  it's everywhere it's absolutely everywhere i know for a fact that in radio because i've worked in
[2:39:19.480 --> 2:39:24.200]  radio and and when i worked at these stations you would sign non-disclosure so it was not me
[2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:30.120]  that they were censoring uh it was uh you know the fact that i just couldn't talk about the news
[2:39:30.120 --> 2:39:35.640]  segment because i discovered it and asked i mean i was ignorant like 16 years ago 17 years ago i'd say
[2:39:35.640 --> 2:39:41.480]  we're paid in the news to have the person read this that's actually paid they go yeah and keep
[2:39:41.480 --> 2:39:45.480]  your mouth shut you got a non-disclosure and i learned that was at all the big news stations
[2:39:46.520 --> 2:39:53.880]  and then they got a huge contract by a state quasi-corporate entity and then basically they
[2:39:53.880 --> 2:39:58.120]  came in it was the lcra lower colorado river authority and said we don't want you to ever
[2:39:58.120 --> 2:40:06.120]  talk about the lcra they're a news sponsor but and i went who are they i i didn't know 16 years ago
[2:40:06.120 --> 2:40:10.520]  then i looked into them and it's like basically a mafia i'm not saying everybody there's bad but
[2:40:10.520 --> 2:40:14.360]  it's a big water grab by corporate interest they get the money they've had a bunch of scandals
[2:40:14.360 --> 2:40:18.200]  i mean that's how involved they were and later i was kind of told listen dummy
[2:40:19.320 --> 2:40:24.120]  you're not going to be on the air soon we're getting other payments and so later only years
[2:40:24.120 --> 2:40:30.280]  later did i click all this state and federal money came in to get me off the air and i think
[2:40:30.280 --> 2:40:35.480]  from doing the research that i was partially taken off my first radio job because of money
[2:40:35.480 --> 2:40:43.480]  from the government and a similar thing happened to me at cnn i mean barin the actual regime would
[2:40:43.480 --> 2:40:48.680]  call the news desk to complain about my reporting and after repeated calls i started noticing that
[2:40:48.680 --> 2:40:54.840]  it became more and more difficult for me to get stories online and i was forced to ridiculous
[2:40:54.840 --> 2:41:01.160]  statements from this regime that we knew was good doffy and a sod esque and and instead i had to
[2:41:01.160 --> 2:41:05.560]  instead of taking them for what they were i had to actually include their lies which included
[2:41:05.560 --> 2:41:10.680]  statements saying that protesters were putting makeup on to fake their injuries and and fake
[2:41:10.680 --> 2:41:16.120]  blood i mean i had to include these ridiculous statements into my reporting alex and and i
[2:41:16.120 --> 2:41:22.600]  believe the network just acquiesced to its paying customer and and that's what we're seeing across
[2:41:22.600 --> 2:41:27.000]  the board in the mainstream media and as long as i've been in the field of journalism and worked
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:33.560]  for the mainstream i've been censored at every single job i've had so i'm a firm believer now
[2:41:33.560 --> 2:41:39.000]  it's nearly impossible to do muck raking investigative journalism at these outlets and
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:43.320]  that's why it's so important to support the independent media because they're the only
[2:41:43.320 --> 2:41:50.520]  ones able to to actually report the truth 100 percent and as that comes out and as people learn
[2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:55.320]  that all these big channels are bought and paid for and even local news channels are people are
[2:41:55.320 --> 2:42:00.200]  leaving them in mass so there's a vacuum for people to not go to college to be a journalist
[2:42:00.200 --> 2:42:04.760]  and i'm not saying that's a total waste but you don't have time folks go out follow it do the
[2:42:04.760 --> 2:42:09.400]  story report it you're not going to be perfect just get your facts right we all see through
[2:42:09.400 --> 2:42:14.600]  rose colored glasses from our own prejudices deep down and things but just stand up for the
[2:42:14.600 --> 2:42:20.360]  bill of rights and constitution stand up for common sense pick issues you're concerned with start a
[2:42:20.360 --> 2:42:25.960]  blog be a photo journalist shoot video go cover protests support the first amendment support
[2:42:25.960 --> 2:42:29.400]  liberty and there's no way they'll stop us all there's a reason they want to shut down the
[2:42:29.400 --> 2:42:32.760]  independent press there's a reason they want to attack protesters that are peaceful to create a
[2:42:32.760 --> 2:42:38.200]  chilling effect because the system knows we've got the moral right they want to control that and
[2:42:38.200 --> 2:42:45.080]  that's why when you put out a book like this uh and i think it's self-published isn't it um no it's
[2:42:45.080 --> 2:42:50.120]  published by wittman press they were an amazing company here really uh they don't normally do
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:55.160]  political books alex it took a lot of convincing uh but at the end i know who they are so i think
[2:42:55.160 --> 2:42:58.920]  they do put out their own books i think they also help folks but that is just fantastic
[2:42:58.920 --> 2:43:04.200]  that they did this with you and so people should get your book to support your ongoing journalism
[2:43:04.200 --> 2:43:08.280]  they should support info wars dot com they should buy our products they should support
[2:43:09.400 --> 2:43:14.840]  everybody ron paul's media operation been swine everybody i'm not in competition with any of these
[2:43:14.840 --> 2:43:19.720]  new journalists whether they be more liberal leaning or conservative leaning or libertarian
[2:43:19.720 --> 2:43:24.600]  leaning if they just tell the truth and promote basic liberty we're all brothers and sisters in
[2:43:24.600 --> 2:43:31.080]  this together exactly and and i think it's it's super important to to support the independent
[2:43:31.080 --> 2:43:37.480]  outlets um i mean that's a great best way i think to give money if you're about to donate to to charity
[2:43:37.480 --> 2:43:43.560]  because that's kind of what journalism has had to become and we we now rely on donations because
[2:43:43.560 --> 2:43:51.000]  it is difficult to uh to to work for these outlets anymore and and to play with the system and so
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:57.160]  we've had to become almost like a non-profit uh to to survive as journalists exactly and now
[2:43:57.160 --> 2:44:01.960]  the fascist diane feinstein wants to restrict everybody else take away any attacks exemption
[2:44:01.960 --> 2:44:06.120]  from private groups of course we don't have that but others and then the government will
[2:44:06.120 --> 2:44:10.280]  decide if you're a journalist and if you have journalistic protection give us your take on
[2:44:10.280 --> 2:44:14.440]  that movement fairness doctrine for talk radio and then we're going to cut to our reporters in the
[2:44:14.440 --> 2:44:19.960]  field uh leon macadoo and jacari jackson who i know may have a few questions for you uh leon's
[2:44:19.960 --> 2:44:24.840]  going to be interviewing you tonight and then of course you can take the of the uh talk in any
[2:44:24.840 --> 2:44:28.840]  direction you want and so give us a preview of what you're going to talk about on the nightly news
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:36.200]  tonight a double a double serving of the intelligent and also of course uh beautiful amber lion
[2:44:36.840 --> 2:44:43.160]  with of course our reporter leon macadoo but give us your take on the move to have the government
[2:44:43.160 --> 2:44:48.360]  declare who's a journalist and who isn't i i just think that's ridiculous because most of the
[2:44:48.360 --> 2:44:54.280]  journalists who we're calling journalists are lap dogs these days not watch dogs so i i consider
[2:44:54.280 --> 2:44:59.000]  more of the independent press to be the more real journalists but the way the government wants to
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:03.880]  word it the mainstream journalists would be considered journalists whereas the independent
[2:45:03.880 --> 2:45:09.480]  press would be at risk of as not being considered journalists by the government so i think it's
[2:45:09.480 --> 2:45:14.040]  it's something that's so changing right now and evolving that it's nearly impossible to define
[2:45:14.600 --> 2:45:19.880]  and and i think if you are out there exposing government crimes and writing about it um and
[2:45:19.880 --> 2:45:25.560]  being a watchdog you are a journalist and we you don't need a definition and a definition is
[2:45:25.560 --> 2:45:31.880]  only to further um make it so that the independent press can be just considered bloggers and
[2:45:31.880 --> 2:45:39.400]  then potentially face face uh criminal charges or be forced to reveal their sources and and
[2:45:39.400 --> 2:45:46.200]  amber lion you're not just as important as cnn or as the new york times you're more important
[2:45:46.200 --> 2:45:52.360]  because you've shown that you got forced out of cnn where you were you know a rock star uh
[2:45:52.360 --> 2:45:58.360]  up and comer you know taken over three ms uh you got forced out for your integrity you left
[2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:06.120]  via your integrity and so you're not on par with cnn you're above them and it shows that cnn's
[2:46:06.120 --> 2:46:12.200]  bought off that they had record viewers for pierce morgan's history when i was on and they
[2:46:12.200 --> 2:46:16.600]  admitted to me when i saw his producers in houston that no we want you on the higher ups have said
[2:46:16.600 --> 2:46:22.520]  no and they said they said we want you back on we want ratings but we've been told no so if i
[2:46:22.520 --> 2:46:28.200]  failed that interview yelling at him no i didn't i broke the spell i said look this is all a fraud
[2:46:28.200 --> 2:46:33.880]  you're paid by big pharma to put kids on drugs that are making them kill people the insert says it
[2:46:33.880 --> 2:46:39.640]  pierce morgan it says it can make you be a mass murderer so stop blaming my second amendment
[2:46:39.640 --> 2:46:43.400]  when if you want to blame anything it's your sponsors that's why they're scared to have me
[2:46:43.400 --> 2:46:48.200]  back on even though it's been voted number one thing of the year what do you say to that well
[2:46:48.200 --> 2:46:51.880]  that's it's true there are decisions being made and i saw it directly when i was working there
[2:46:51.880 --> 2:46:56.440]  that had nothing to do with the journalistic value or getting viewers and that was something
[2:46:56.440 --> 2:47:01.160]  that i couldn't wrap my head around while i was there because i would come up sometimes with some
[2:47:01.160 --> 2:47:07.800]  story ideas that i knew would really generate a significant audience and and had a lot of
[2:47:07.800 --> 2:47:13.640]  journalistic value and those stories were were sidelined and and i couldn't quite figure out
[2:47:13.640 --> 2:47:18.280]  what the reasoning was but there are decisions being made there that aren't uh that have nothing
[2:47:18.280 --> 2:47:23.240]  to do with the journalistic value of a story or getting viewers and that's disturbing it's who's
[2:47:23.240 --> 2:47:28.760]  making these decisions and why and we saw that with the occupied movement as well that's what
[2:47:28.760 --> 2:47:34.920]  we cover here is if it's important it's breaking it affects our liberties we don't think black
[2:47:34.920 --> 2:47:41.800]  white old young male female christian not christian muslim whatever gay not gay we think is it freedom
[2:47:41.800 --> 2:47:46.920]  who's the little guy you know isn't the system trying to take our rights and then we go out and
[2:47:46.920 --> 2:47:51.400]  report on it and then of course for us that's exciting that's exciting everybody else and so
[2:47:51.400 --> 2:47:56.200]  we're successful i mean telling the truth is successful people want it amber lions are guests
[2:47:56.200 --> 2:48:00.440]  at the end of the hour and we're going to go now um and get her take on this leon macadoo
[2:48:00.440 --> 2:48:05.080]  jacari jackson are there at the capital they've been doing man on the street out there about the
[2:48:05.080 --> 2:48:09.880]  texas making kids not be able to bring christmas cards to the schools and we've had that report
[2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:15.880]  up earlier and leon joins us leon before you go in after the break and talk to one of the state
[2:48:15.880 --> 2:48:19.800]  reps about their view on this would you like to say anything to amber lion who you're going to be
[2:48:19.800 --> 2:48:25.400]  interviewing tonight well hello amber uh obviously you had to deal with you know suppression of the
[2:48:25.400 --> 2:48:31.080]  press but what do you think about the fact that texas actually had to pass a law to allow people
[2:48:31.080 --> 2:48:38.600]  to just say merry christmas or hand out christmas cards i i mean i i just think that's it's a slight
[2:48:38.600 --> 2:48:44.680]  overreach and um and i and i mean it's obvious you guys are reporting on it's it's just ridiculous
[2:48:45.640 --> 2:48:50.840]  well they had to pass the law but still schools aren't letting kids hand out christian christmas
[2:48:50.840 --> 2:48:56.360]  cards or even if it has a tree they're saying no uh and now the school's backed off but uh
[2:48:56.360 --> 2:49:02.600]  here's a headline today uh newsmax christmas trees banned at texas school called draconian
[2:49:02.600 --> 2:49:07.720]  and i mean it is a christian holiday but it's not even religious to have a christmas tree
[2:49:07.720 --> 2:49:12.200]  i mean this is crazy when we're losing all our basic rights we're losing our fourth amendment
[2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:16.440]  we got foreign banks robbing us we've got our press being bought off by foreign companies
[2:49:16.440 --> 2:49:22.520]  and foreign governments and then they're making the threat amber a christmas tree and i think
[2:49:22.520 --> 2:49:27.880]  anytime we and that's why i'm glad you guys are highlighting this story anytime we face any infractions
[2:49:27.880 --> 2:49:33.480]  on our first amendment rights it's just a slippery slope and so what what's going to be banned next
[2:49:33.480 --> 2:49:39.080]  and that's what uh deserves me in this situation and that's why i'm glad you guys are taking the
[2:49:39.080 --> 2:49:43.800]  lead in and covering this story well when we come back here in just a minute they're going to walk
[2:49:43.800 --> 2:49:48.040]  into a state reps office and ask them and i'm sure they're just going to say no comment it'll be one
[2:49:48.040 --> 2:49:52.360]  minute then we can come back to you and finish talking about the book uh but uh let me go back
[2:49:52.360 --> 2:49:56.120]  to mackadoo here as we have one minute till we got a break and we'll come back with uh our guest
[2:49:56.120 --> 2:50:01.400]  talking about her book peace love and pepper spray lean real quick whose office have you chosen to go

[2:54:37.720 --> 2:54:42.360]  gallery in a very nice gentleman named austin came over and told us that we need to seek permission
[2:54:42.360 --> 2:54:45.960]  to film the senate gallery i did inform the gentleman and it's not our attention to film the
[2:54:45.960 --> 2:54:49.960]  senate told us we wanted to speak to one of our representatives but there is no senate in session
[2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:55.480]  and you don't need permission it's a right when it's not in session he's just hin pecking you
[2:54:55.480 --> 2:55:00.040]  to be your boss and i don't care if he's polite robbing our first amendment even though he's doing
[2:55:00.040 --> 2:55:06.040]  it polite isn't nice what does he now said to you he's basically given us the address where we can
[2:55:06.040 --> 2:55:11.880]  seek permission to film here and yeah but notice notice notice there's no state police talking
[2:55:11.880 --> 2:55:16.760]  the state police are not talking to you because that's made up so ignore him and go in wendy

[2:55:28.120 --> 2:55:31.480]  showing it davis is anybody available to make a statement on her behalf
[2:55:34.680 --> 2:55:39.560]  there they are how can we get in touch with her can we send a call or an email or i see one of

[2:55:43.080 --> 2:55:47.400]  out of there the state police didn't stop them you don't need the media is in there every day and
[2:55:47.400 --> 2:55:54.920]  doesn't get permission okay i'm sick of color of law crud let me get amber lions take on this three
[2:55:54.920 --> 2:55:59.640]  time emmy award-winning cnn journalists this is what we're talking about there is no law there is
[2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:04.840]  no regulation there is no permission to be in the capital unless you're in somebody's private
[2:56:04.840 --> 2:56:09.960]  office where he drug them in there i mean what do you make of this another bureaucrat it's not the
[2:56:09.960 --> 2:56:15.800]  state police they know the law what do you make of the bureaucrat trying to do that well i think
[2:56:15.800 --> 2:56:20.840]  that they're trying to avoid your questions more than anything and i think that you do have a right
[2:56:20.840 --> 2:56:25.720]  to be there obviously as reporters and i'm appreciative of your efforts to actually hold
[2:56:25.720 --> 2:56:31.480]  political elites accountable and not become lap dogs like you see at these mainstream press
[2:56:31.480 --> 2:56:37.560]  conferences where the press just becomes puppets to the authorities i i think that
[2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:42.440]  your approach is a true investigative journalist approach and that's when you should be walking
[2:56:42.440 --> 2:56:47.720]  up to these officials with a microphone in hand questioning them about their behaviors exactly now

[3:00:31.960 --> 3:00:35.960]  sometimes it's live sometimes it's taped to air a lot of times the interviews are taped before the

[3:00:49.080 --> 3:00:53.960]  another 30 minutes of stations one an hour and we're we're building all this doing all this
[3:00:53.960 --> 3:00:58.920]  while broadcasting while doing the news while doing the magazine the films the commercials
[3:00:58.920 --> 3:01:04.840]  the products to fund ourselves that's why they've had major trade publications out there like
[3:01:04.840 --> 3:01:11.480]  talkers and new york times and others say that info wars dot com and what i've done is trailblazing
[3:01:11.480 --> 3:01:15.480]  how to build new media now doesn't mean i'm even good at it now other people with more money and
[3:01:15.480 --> 3:01:21.560]  stuff have already gone past us uh with audiences and and and effectiveness our message i believe
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:26.280]  is the most constitutional pro-liberty and i'm very proud of what we've done but i am not in
[3:01:26.280 --> 3:01:31.000]  competition with other journalists and people that are fighting for liberty if they're not
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:38.440]  authoritarians and they care about justice and they are not eugenicist i don't care if they are
[3:01:39.240 --> 3:01:43.720]  liberal conservative christian not christian gay straight whatever it is we're in so much
[3:01:43.720 --> 3:01:48.760]  trouble with the new world order folks we have to come together for basic freedom it's about
[3:01:48.760 --> 3:01:55.240]  state-run media versus independent media it's about fascism versus libertarian ideas as matt
[3:01:55.240 --> 3:02:01.800]  drudge famously tweeted and that is what we're dealing with here and i am very excited that glenn
[3:02:01.800 --> 3:02:05.800]  beck doesn't attack me anymore and make stuff up and it's gotten more hardcore against the new world
[3:02:05.800 --> 3:02:10.680]  order because i didn't used to attack him you know just because i wanted to i did it because he'd
[3:02:10.680 --> 3:02:15.560]  lie about me and and get things wrong maybe he's woken up i'm not in competition with any of these
[3:02:15.560 --> 3:02:23.640]  people i want to make money so that i can build the best news organization out there and protect
[3:02:23.640 --> 3:02:29.640]  ourselves and be strong and beat the globalist i want to win and we have to realize we need to
[3:02:29.640 --> 3:02:34.440]  be ready to win we need to think like winners and think about taking our civilization back
[3:02:34.440 --> 3:02:39.160]  and not think of this all as a foregone conclusion and and evil can't be beaten and oh my god
[3:02:39.160 --> 3:02:44.360]  everybody's an agent and blah blah blah believe me i know a lot of good people i know i'm a good guy
[3:02:44.920 --> 3:02:49.720]  i know i'm for real i mean i don't like being a slave i take it real personal it's a drug
[3:02:49.720 --> 3:02:56.920]  to fight control freaks it is a drug to be the underdog and beat him it is a drug i mean it is a drug
[3:02:58.280 --> 3:03:03.160]  it is a drug to have 300 people in a protest in dallas in the last 30 that stay with you get
[3:03:03.160 --> 3:03:08.280]  attacked by the police after four hours in the rain and then to take them all into a warm hotel and
[3:03:08.280 --> 3:03:15.560]  buy them all hot tea and hamburgers and hot chocolate and stuff i mean it's like just goodness
[3:03:15.560 --> 3:03:22.360]  is so good that sounds incredibly cheesy but that's what it all comes down to and i just want to commend

[3:03:59.560 --> 3:04:03.960]  separates from good and evil there's people that really like evil and corruption those of us that
