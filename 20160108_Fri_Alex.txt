[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:30.480]  it only intensifies the full-out assault of global government consolidation of the
[00:30.480 --> 00:39.640]  people of the planet weedling amounts of incredible information dizzy the mind great
[00:39.640 --> 00:44.200]  awakenings are happening but also at the cost of great loss of freedom as the
[00:44.200 --> 00:49.000]  gloves are taken off and the tyrannical social engineers of the planetary regime
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.720]  sink their teeth into the bones they've already chewed into our flesh now
[00:54.720 --> 01:00.040]  they're getting into the bones of the very system that sustains humanity on
[01:00.040 --> 01:07.560]  this planet wow I did not watch the Obama speech yesterday on CNN the whole
[01:07.560 --> 01:13.240]  town hall until my children had gone to bed then I went online and watched it and
[01:13.240 --> 01:19.480]  backed it up and rewatched it and began sending lists to Nico the great producer
[01:19.480 --> 01:25.160]  to collate with Richard and others today and we have at least 12 clips we're
[01:25.160 --> 01:32.680]  going to play every one of them is an over-the-top massive deception Obama
[01:32.680 --> 01:40.160]  says nobody wants your guns nobody and 2 plus 2 equals 5 nobody's coming for
[01:40.160 --> 01:46.160]  your guns nobody's ever come for your guns America was founded in paranoia
[01:46.160 --> 01:56.920]  basically of imaginary enemies it was incredible the one thing that might have
[01:56.920 --> 02:02.600]  been truthful in there was this establishment alien that's what my
[02:02.600 --> 02:06.920]  buddy Anthony Gucci already calls people that have been raised by wealthy
[02:06.920 --> 02:14.120]  families and insulated for so long white black it doesn't matter that they just
[02:14.120 --> 02:17.180]  don't know how the real world works it's like George Herbert Walker Bush ten
[02:17.180 --> 02:20.600]  years after scanners were ubiquitous walking through a grocery store and
[02:20.600 --> 02:26.360]  saying what's this was it ABC Nightly News what's that I I've never seen one of
[02:26.360 --> 02:33.080]  those been around for 20 years at that time been ubiquitous for a decade what
[02:33.080 --> 02:43.600]  was it like 1990 didn't know what a checkout barcode laser scanner was I'll
[02:43.600 --> 02:50.600]  assure you he knows what a planetary government is Obama said I've never owned
[02:50.600 --> 02:55.760]  a gun never been around him but you're guarded by thousands of and stinger
[02:55.760 --> 02:59.560]  missiles on top the roofs of the White House from hijacked jet airliners and
[02:59.560 --> 03:04.440]  you're guarded by hundreds of thousands of men and women with guns that defend
[03:04.440 --> 03:09.440]  the country but you've never had one and that's the problem with a Max Kaiser or
[03:09.440 --> 03:13.600]  a Barack Obama and I like Max but he's from you know New York Connecticut never
[03:13.600 --> 03:20.280]  been around guns never shot them they literally are like space aliens and I'm
[03:20.280 --> 03:25.520]  kind of like a space alien compared to my dad my dad knows how to fix pretty much
[03:25.520 --> 03:32.080]  any engine parts electrical farming carpentry metallurgy he can blacksmith
[03:32.080 --> 03:38.920]  it's like a it's like he worked it's like he's an elf who belongs in Santa
[03:38.920 --> 03:49.760]  Claus's workshop and his father was even better now compared to most men I know
[03:49.760 --> 03:53.360]  how to change the tire work on a few things here and there I know how to you
[03:53.360 --> 04:02.920]  know drive nails not a roof a house but I am a jibbering moron I am mentally
[04:02.920 --> 04:07.920]  retarded when it comes to technical things and building things compared to
[04:07.920 --> 04:12.200]  my father I mean my dad can snake a toilet my dad can put in pipes my dad can
[04:12.200 --> 04:17.720]  put in floors my dad can do you name it he can do it and do it fast I had like
[04:17.720 --> 04:21.600]  an R2-D2 robot when I was like 12 that broke and he got in it and soldered it
[04:21.600 --> 04:25.280]  like an hour and got it working again I mean you don't see that and then you and
[04:25.280 --> 04:28.760]  then I was downtown yesterday taking her business and I looked at people black
[04:28.760 --> 04:33.240]  white old young they look like soft moron zombies and they don't know how to
[04:33.240 --> 04:39.120]  do anything but watch CNN and hear about how evil guns are despite the fact that
[04:39.120 --> 04:44.560]  gun crimes down 60 plus percent since 1992 just department O numbers so that's
[04:44.560 --> 04:49.640]  really the crisis we face that even the establishment vampires are these inept
[04:49.640 --> 04:54.800]  moron I mean I was 10 years old could shoot bullseye at 300 yards Obama doesn't
[04:54.800 --> 05:02.080]  even know how to wipe his rear end the Obama administration is pushing for the
[05:02.080 --> 05:07.040]  largest gun grab in American history we're also taking steps to make the
[05:07.040 --> 05:11.200]  background check system more efficient and we're gonna bring an outdated
[05:11.200 --> 05:15.360]  background check system into the 21st century anyone critical of the government
[05:15.360 --> 05:20.000]  could have their second amendment rights taken away simply if psychologists
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.520]  diagnose them with what they are calling oppositional defiant disorder which
[05:25.520 --> 05:31.480]  the American Psychiatric Association describes as a defiant disobedient and
[05:31.480 --> 05:36.920]  hostile behavior toward authority other measures will allow doctors to report
[05:36.920 --> 05:43.080]  patients to the FBI and RFID tracking with smart guns we're gonna boost gun

[08:51.240 --> 08:55.880]  market is being overthrown for crony capitalism socialism and communism are
[08:55.880 --> 08:59.800]  being promoted to the grassroots to complete their journey to domestication
[08:59.800 --> 09:08.120]  and walrus like helplessness the battle is here
[09:08.120 --> 09:14.600]  stock markets around the world are plunging you can see in live time if
[09:14.600 --> 09:20.880]  you go to drudgereport.com that it began plunging massively this morning and
[09:20.880 --> 09:28.280]  then at about 11 o'clock Eastern they began to pump it up with the admitted
[09:28.280 --> 09:32.720]  president's committee on open markets of the plunge protection team which they
[09:32.720 --> 09:38.320]  even denied was a manipulating markets until a few years ago they admit they
[09:38.320 --> 09:43.840]  began pumping the market up yesterday as well it wasn't a quote glitch remember
[09:43.840 --> 09:47.240]  last year they had those quote glitches they now admit those were not glitches
[09:47.240 --> 09:55.560]  just to show how they lie to us out of hand we're going to be breaking all of
[09:55.560 --> 10:02.880]  that down earthquake in Oklahoma raises fears of a big one New York Times
[10:02.880 --> 10:07.120]  Donald Trump's big tent Politico says the GOP should not be fooling itself
[10:07.120 --> 10:11.760]  Trump is reaching more than just undereducated angry white men up yeah
[10:11.760 --> 10:16.280]  Lewis Farrakhan and I'm gonna air the interview soon it'll be at least next
[10:16.280 --> 10:21.240]  week's is two hours long we've got to put it all together basically likes
[10:21.240 --> 10:28.120]  Trump I mean it's just it's over the top people it's just transcending race
[10:28.120 --> 10:34.200]  religion all of it people are sick of the establishment and Farrakhan agrees
[10:34.200 --> 10:38.200]  that they're bringing radical Muslims in from Syria that are warfighters that
[10:38.200 --> 10:41.960]  are going to attack and it's going to be used to bring in martial law in
[10:41.960 --> 10:47.680]  America and he's been told they've got a grand jury convene in Chicago secretly
[10:47.680 --> 10:51.400]  this is breaking and that when this all kicks off they're going to arrest him
[10:51.400 --> 10:56.160]  and others which by the way is in the COG plan to not just go after black
[10:56.160 --> 11:03.600]  nationalist leaders but also Liberty leaders and by the way the president
[11:03.600 --> 11:08.560]  specifically responded to info wars last night the White House has responded
[11:08.560 --> 11:12.000]  to us by name before on power plant shutdowns and they've had their surrogates
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.040]  attack us on a daily basis organizations run by the White House like
[11:16.040 --> 11:19.680]  media matters and others and it's no secret that we're one of the main
[11:19.680 --> 11:23.800]  targets in America now when boss kind of receded it's mainly Matt drudge Alex
[11:23.800 --> 11:29.840]  Jones when Beck is receded it's Matt drudge Alex Jones because we're the
[11:29.840 --> 11:33.640]  people reaching the big numbers I mean he said you don't want to go to that
[11:33.640 --> 11:41.440]  website you know that says that register confiscate tyranny first comes
[11:41.440 --> 11:45.000]  registration then comes confiscation then becomes tyranny that is an Alex
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.400]  Jones maximum of 20 years you can pull the clips up all day I mean they are
[11:50.400 --> 11:55.560]  directly responding with a straight face that oh there are no death panels in
[11:55.560 --> 11:58.800]  the Obamacare here's the subsection after it passes they go of course they're
[11:58.800 --> 12:04.800]  death panels oh you keep your doctor really says you can oh you said it's
[12:04.800 --> 12:11.880]  free no it's not so Obama responds to the quote conspiracy theories we're
[12:11.880 --> 12:18.760]  gonna be getting into all that we're learning more about what's happening in
[12:18.760 --> 12:23.800]  Europe and it's worse than we even thought we're gonna be getting into the
[12:23.800 --> 12:30.960]  massive rape epidemic taking place but getting back to Obama there are so many
[12:30.960 --> 12:39.360]  angles to this and I'm gonna just start with these clips and go through them
[12:39.360 --> 12:43.880]  first we're gonna play Obama saying he's never owned a gun because through
[12:43.880 --> 12:48.200]  this interview you can understand everything then he goes on and says
[12:48.200 --> 12:54.520]  that there is no plot or conspiracy to take your guns no just every city the
[12:54.520 --> 13:01.400]  Democrats run they have total gun ban Chicago New York DC couple hundred
[13:01.400 --> 13:04.760]  people have concealed carries or whatever that you get from the government
[13:04.760 --> 13:07.880]  New York of your part of the establishment I mean essentially there's 18
[13:07.880 --> 13:11.360]  million people and a couple hundred can carry guns and Bloomberg's got like 15
[13:11.360 --> 13:15.400]  armed guards on video when he walks around pulling guns out on people but
[13:15.400 --> 13:23.360]  you can't have one I mean ridiculous hypocrisy then we've got Obama saying
[13:23.360 --> 13:27.760]  guns should be safe like everything else smart guns and I saw Fox News this
[13:27.760 --> 13:32.920]  morning on two different shows I was exercising saying the talking point well
[13:32.920 --> 13:37.120]  conservatives agree we should have smart guns let's not debate that so the new
[13:37.120 --> 13:41.040]  talking point is we agree to smart guns they'll ban all the previous guns
[13:41.040 --> 13:45.440]  they'll be able to neutralize and turn off all the new ones they they admit
[13:45.440 --> 13:50.720]  microstamping registration all of this is to ban the old guns and then pick up
[13:50.720 --> 13:55.040]  the new guns later I mean I have the mayor proteam in Austin laughing at a
[13:55.040 --> 13:58.680]  gun rally and saying you're signed about confiscation that's not happening yet
[13:58.680 --> 14:02.880]  once we register then we get them first we do this which was registration
[14:02.880 --> 14:08.440]  state of Texas we shot it down Bloomberg financed it you shot it down the
[14:08.440 --> 14:12.240]  governor shot it down and they just sit there and go we will get your guns I
[14:12.240 --> 14:16.040]  mean I've seen the violence policy center in the front page the Austin
[14:16.040 --> 14:21.160]  American statesman in 2000 when I caught bribery on video at the Capitol and
[14:21.160 --> 14:24.240]  there was a criminal investigation and it derailed the whole group of gun
[14:24.240 --> 14:29.720]  control laws over it and they actually said in the paper doesn't matter what
[14:29.720 --> 14:34.000]  Mr. Jones does we have your children in the public schools and are educating
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.800]  them and we will ban guns within the next generation it was a quote of the
[14:38.800 --> 14:43.720]  head of the violence policy center in the front of the paper saying we will
[14:43.720 --> 14:52.280]  get your guns and they've got salon and Newsweek and Daily Beast and all these
[14:52.280 --> 14:57.040]  other groups saying no we need to go ahead and just take the guns yes it's
[14:57.040 --> 15:02.480]  about confiscating them Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in that's Diane
[15:02.480 --> 15:07.200]  Feinstein and Obama just gets up there like he can triumph over reality with
[15:07.200 --> 15:16.360]  his BS and say nobody wants your guns I know America was founded by people that
[15:16.360 --> 15:23.280]  were paranoid of a foreign power England but you like that stupid too
[15:23.280 --> 15:27.360]  no the British were here raping robbing stealing not letting anybody have
[15:27.360 --> 15:31.520]  businesses unless they pay giant taxes you had to be connected to royalty to
[15:31.520 --> 15:35.920]  get licenses for businesses that's the real reason George Washington wanted
[15:35.920 --> 15:43.480]  war because he was a second-class citizen in business well if he didn't
[15:43.480 --> 15:46.400]  like being discriminated against imagine how black people feel hundred times
[15:46.400 --> 15:50.760]  worse I mean I get their grievances but that's what it was really all about and
[15:50.760 --> 15:55.560]  the British would grab colonial children when they'd stop press gangs in
[15:55.560 --> 16:01.200]  in the UK in England because of riots they'd stop press gangs in Scotland
[16:01.200 --> 16:05.280]  England and Ireland they'd come into your town sometimes a hundred miles
[16:05.280 --> 16:08.840]  inland and the government would grab your six seven eight nine year old and
[16:08.840 --> 16:15.880]  bring them as slaves onto the ships they'd be gone basically forever no judge
[16:15.880 --> 16:22.000]  no jury no law press gangs slavery on average you wouldn't survive two or
[16:22.000 --> 16:27.520]  three missions a lot of those shipping missions had a third casualties they
[16:27.520 --> 16:32.240]  would come take your kids and they came and were enslaving the colonies and
[16:32.240 --> 16:38.000]  that was another big reason was impress mint impress mint you don't get taught
[16:38.000 --> 16:41.720]  about that in school because only black people were slaves because we want to
[16:41.720 --> 16:46.520]  make them have an identity complex and feel bad so the Democrats the actual
[16:46.520 --> 16:50.840]  progenitors of the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazis can perch on top of them and
[16:50.840 --> 16:54.400]  control them and abort them and dump them down this is just all the facts
[16:54.400 --> 17:01.080]  being laid out here now continuing ladies and gentlemen it goes on the one
[17:01.080 --> 17:08.440]  good shining ray was Chris Kyle's widow Tya Kyle and I just can't help but love
[17:08.440 --> 17:12.960]  her I mean she's telling the truth I mean I'm sorry it's just it's just she's
[17:12.960 --> 17:17.600]  standing up for the second amendment that's what it's all about why don't we
[17:17.600 --> 17:22.000]  celebrate lower murder rates that's right it's down 61% I went with the
[17:22.000 --> 17:25.800]  Justice Department numbers that came out two years ago and they said 51 and we
[17:25.800 --> 17:30.580]  crunched the numbers and had an actual statistician from Southwest Texas do the
[17:30.580 --> 17:36.280]  analysis around South Texas and they found out he did it even though he
[17:36.280 --> 17:39.960]  wasn't published in it and threatened to fire him that was Rob do's brother he's
[17:39.960 --> 17:47.800]  now a statistician for a big company and got a doctorate in it and then a doctorate
[17:47.800 --> 17:55.240]  yeah and we found 51% drop in violent crime using guns it's 92 confirming
[17:55.240 --> 17:58.160]  Justice Department numbers but a lot on the top says this in the world said no
[17:58.160 --> 18:05.240]  it's 61 so folks 61% drop in crime using guns because gun ownership has
[18:05.240 --> 18:10.720]  exploded and they've imprisoned a lot of criminals and people are blowing away
[18:10.720 --> 18:13.960]  criminals more and more and that's most the 12,000 deaths a year are people
[18:13.960 --> 18:19.200]  committing suicide or criminals getting blown away and so she gets up there and
[18:19.200 --> 18:22.400]  says why don't you celebrate it instead of Obama just keeps getting up there
[18:22.400 --> 18:26.560]  going it's getting worse it's getting worse it's getting worse I've even heard
[18:26.560 --> 18:30.120]  ads on the network for body armor which is great body armor but it says the
[18:30.120 --> 18:34.280]  mass shootings are happening as getting worse get your body armor no it's not
[18:34.280 --> 18:40.520]  it's not true mass shootings are flat every other form of gun violence is down
[18:40.520 --> 18:48.920]  massively and then statistics don't lie folks numbers don't lie the media acts
[18:48.920 --> 18:54.520]  like the biggest issue in the country is cops shooting you you're talking about a
[18:54.520 --> 18:59.040]  couple hundred people maybe a year that are unjustifiable and I'm not even
[18:59.040 --> 19:02.320]  defending the police culture or what's going on I'm a big critic of it I'm just
[19:02.320 --> 19:06.120]  not gonna sit or lie to you when all you turn on TV it's the end of the world the
[19:06.120 --> 19:10.320]  cops are gonna kill you and it just didn't true they kill 1100 people a year
[19:10.320 --> 19:16.200]  on a bad year and most of them are criminals most of it is the police
[19:16.200 --> 19:19.840]  defending people against criminals I'm all for good people armed police
[19:19.840 --> 19:24.280]  citizens you name it most police are good that's why they're attacking them in
[19:24.280 --> 19:30.120]  the media to get a civil war going in this country and I'm not gonna sit here
[19:30.120 --> 19:34.480]  idly by and watch all hell break loose now let me give you the big news
[19:34.480 --> 19:39.120]  Obama said in his speech repeatedly in his talk at the town hall and CNN that
[19:39.120 --> 19:43.440]  he doesn't want the guns of these conspiracy sites are bad lying about it
[19:43.440 --> 19:48.880]  and then CNN ran an op-ed saying declare civil emergency that's what they're
[19:48.880 --> 19:54.320]  gonna call martial law and take the guns and basically have a civil war it
[19:54.320 --> 20:00.640]  actually they actually say it CNN the following statements have not been
[20:00.640 --> 20:04.560]  evaluated by the FDA this product is not intended to diagnose treat cure or
[20:04.560 --> 20:09.240]  prevent any disease something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in
[20:09.240 --> 20:12.840]  San Diego the old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now

[23:10.800 --> 23:14.760]  proof revealing their secret could land me in hot water but I think you deserve
[23:14.760 --> 23:19.880]  to know exactly what they're doing watch the viral video at FEMA 3.com
[23:19.880 --> 23:24.920]  before it disappears again but be warned it's really disturbing because the fact
[23:24.920 --> 23:30.440]  is they must know something we don't go to FEMA 3.com to see the number one
[23:30.440 --> 23:34.280]  item you should be hoarding and why supplies of this critical item are so
[23:34.280 --> 23:39.600]  low or even completely sold out at many stores across America don't miss out
[23:39.600 --> 23:43.240]  watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart papers have
[23:43.240 --> 23:49.000]  already seen in recent days go to FEMA 3.com and discover the number one most
[23:49.000 --> 23:54.000]  critical item in a crisis watch the shocking video right now at FEMA 3.com
[23:54.000 --> 24:17.760]  again that's FEMA 3.com I have never owned a gun now up at Camp David we've
[24:17.760 --> 24:25.680]  got some skeet shooting so on a fairly regular basis we get a 12 gauge and I'm
[24:25.680 --> 24:30.360]  not making any claims about my marksmanship but before you were
[24:30.360 --> 24:34.400]  president did you ever feel a desire to get a gun to feel the need to get a gun
[24:34.400 --> 24:43.920]  you know I grew up mostly in Hawaii and other than hunting for wild pig which
[24:43.920 --> 24:51.640]  they do once in a while you know there's not the popularity of hunting and
[24:51.640 --> 24:55.640]  sportsmanship with guns as much as there are in other parts of the country
[24:55.640 --> 25:00.160]  right I mean I asked the question because there's a lot of people out there
[25:00.160 --> 25:05.240]  who don't trust you obviously at the issue of guns now there you go the only
[25:05.240 --> 25:08.880]  truthful thing Obama and my view researching this entire disgusting two
[25:08.880 --> 25:17.160]  hour event is that they are disconnected most of the people that are
[25:17.160 --> 25:22.680]  anti-gun most of these elitists have never been around guns never owned guns
[25:22.680 --> 25:27.280]  never used guns because even major conservatives that are rich and part of
[25:27.280 --> 25:32.000]  the establishment they just can't help it they love the culture so much it's in
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.440]  the DNA to be armed as a free person they just they just can't bring
[25:36.440 --> 25:41.680]  themselves to totally ban the guns but that's very few of the elite and they're
[25:41.680 --> 25:47.040]  almost universally protected by bodyguards taxpayer money and so they
[25:47.040 --> 25:53.960]  really are disconnected and they're scared of the slaves having guns
[25:55.440 --> 25:59.000]  slaves don't have free speech slaves aren't allowed to have weapons whether
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.480]  it was the Roman Empire or the deep south with slavery and say 1800 it's a
[26:03.480 --> 26:07.680]  fact and it's a fact gun control laws were passed at the end of the Civil War
[26:07.680 --> 26:15.400]  the first ever in this country to keep black people from getting guns now let's
[26:15.400 --> 26:24.360]  continue President Obama on the notion of a plot a conspiracy and he says
[26:24.360 --> 26:28.680]  nobody is coming for your guns that is the biggest ball face line I've ever
[26:28.680 --> 26:35.400]  heard they take the guns in every other country total gun bans they take the guns
[26:35.400 --> 26:40.920]  in Chicago New York DC they want total abolition they're all on record at the
[26:40.920 --> 26:45.040]  major think tanks the Bloomberg groups but they have this double lie where they
[26:45.040 --> 26:47.800]  go Bloomberg came out last year and said I'm the biggest second cement
[26:47.800 --> 26:54.320]  segment supporter ever he goes I support it people like what like lower your
[26:54.320 --> 26:58.440]  defenses is like saving Private Ryan where you know they're fighting rolling
[26:58.440 --> 27:03.360]  around with the knives and the GIs about to win so the German goes no no I give
[27:03.360 --> 27:09.560]  up just to make him have us hesitate enough to drive that knife into it and
[27:09.560 --> 27:14.160]  that's what this is I mean these people want our guns and how creepy is it to
[27:14.160 --> 27:18.120]  have them up on TV going nobody wants your guns and we're all supposed to play
[27:18.120 --> 27:21.800]  along with it and and by the way gun crimes way up and everybody just goes
[27:21.800 --> 27:27.920]  along with it all lies from known liars who said in their first campaign in
[27:27.920 --> 27:32.960]  2008 no one's coming after any guns we believe in it there'll be no do gun
[27:32.960 --> 27:36.800]  loss and all they've done is launch attacks and they have all these
[27:36.800 --> 27:40.240]  countless I'm talking thousands of articles that I've seen the last six
[27:40.240 --> 27:46.200]  seven years saying I'm insane nobody wants our guns I'm insane he won't use
[27:46.200 --> 27:51.120]  executive action on the guns I kept saying he would 2013 he said I can't use
[27:51.120 --> 27:55.600]  executive action we played the clip yesterday it's unconstitutional now he
[27:55.600 --> 28:00.200]  says I'm gonna act cuz Congress won't get in line with incredibly draconian
[28:00.200 --> 28:06.080]  stuff that Congress couldn't pass under the Constitution they can't even do
[28:06.080 --> 28:11.440]  this but he's doing it flagrantly illegal let's go to the president on the
[28:11.440 --> 28:15.360]  conspiracies here it is is it fair to call it a conspiracy I mean well yeah a
[28:15.360 --> 28:19.600]  lot of people really believe this deeply that they just don't know they just don't
[28:19.600 --> 28:23.360]  trust you I'm sorry Cooper yes it is fair to call the conspiracy what do you
[28:23.360 --> 28:33.200]  say are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take
[28:33.200 --> 28:37.680]  everybody's guns away so that we can impose martial law there's really a
[28:37.680 --> 28:41.400]  lot of conspiracy yes that is a conspiracy I would hope stop you would
[28:41.400 --> 28:44.840]  agree with that we're gonna go to break back on the plate again this is so
[28:44.840 --> 28:51.640]  profound we've had seven million views just on Facebook mentions that's just a
[28:51.640 --> 28:56.560]  new platform we're using invading that system JZ doesn't get that in a week
[28:56.560 --> 29:04.840]  folks Kanye West Barack Obama goes on his Facebook and gets like 10,000 views
[29:04.840 --> 29:10.880]  on a video go look that just shows we're just one outlet fighting him seven
[29:10.880 --> 29:17.200]  million people and guess what the video titles are Obama bringing in martial law
[29:17.200 --> 29:23.040]  gun control to be used under martial law and guess what CNN called for yesterday
[29:23.040 --> 29:28.480]  I have the article in the article victims father Obama's gun actions won't
[29:28.480 --> 29:34.480]  make a dent Elliott Feynman CNN op-ed calls for Obama to declare national
[29:34.480 --> 29:38.840]  state of emergency close quote to gut the Second Amendment they're calling for a
[29:38.840 --> 29:45.360]  state of emergency to confiscate and to nationalize the gun manufacturers if that
[29:45.360 --> 29:52.160]  ain't martial law I don't know what is on the march the empires on the run Alex
[29:52.160 --> 30:00.680]  Jones and the GCN radio network a Missouri bill defines sex between
[30:00.680 --> 30:06.640]  lawmakers and lobbyists as a gift reports NBC News lobbyist in Missouri who
[30:06.640 --> 30:10.560]  have sex with state lawmakers or their aides would have to disclose that
[30:10.560 --> 30:14.800]  activity to the state ethics commission under a bill introduced this week by a
[30:14.800 --> 30:19.200]  Republican state representative the measure pushed by representative Bart
[30:19.200 --> 30:24.080]  Corman defines sexual relations between lawmakers and lobbyists as a gift to be
[30:24.080 --> 30:28.480]  reported on the disclosure forms that lobbyists file on a monthly basis the
[30:28.480 --> 30:33.080]  bill does not assign a dollar valuation to the gift of sex Corman's proposal
[30:33.080 --> 30:37.440]  reported early Thursday by the Kansas City Star quickly gained attention on
[30:37.440 --> 30:41.560]  social media and Corman told USA Today that he was building calls from
[30:41.560 --> 30:45.280]  reporters all across the country demanding to know more about his
[30:45.280 --> 30:49.880]  unorthodox proposal I guess this has gone viral or something he was quoted as

[34:18.000 --> 34:21.760]  actually more than 12 because we've got a compilation of Obama saying Bush's
[34:21.760 --> 34:25.600]  executive actions are illegal and a total threat because he's a constitutional
[34:25.600 --> 34:31.520]  lawyer he knows that which was true then he gets up and does stuff Jonathan

[34:36.560 --> 34:41.600]  worse than Nixon Nixon had 120 something names in a safe and was thinking
[34:41.600 --> 34:46.680]  about harassing a couple of them with IRS audits Obama's gone after more than
[34:46.680 --> 34:53.440]  10,000 Christian groups alone that's 10,000 times worse than not going after
[34:53.440 --> 35:02.320]  anybody I saw a comment oh I heard Alex say thousands of times worse than
[35:02.320 --> 35:07.800]  Nixon how's that possible well I mean just on the IRS thing he's tens of
[35:07.800 --> 35:13.960]  thousands times worse I mean imagine if Obama scandal was breaking in some
[35:13.960 --> 35:23.360]  Republicans psychiatrist office that's child's play to funding al Qaeda and ISIS
[35:23.360 --> 35:30.400]  to murder tens of thousands of people a month and Libyan Syria ongoing take every
[35:30.400 --> 35:34.920]  progressive Muslim and chop their head off they're murdering the black
[35:34.920 --> 35:38.640]  Africans in Libya the black Muslims that's how racist a lot of these
[35:38.640 --> 35:43.840]  will hobbyist are oh man I say Saudi Arabia and will hobbyist hate black people so
[35:43.840 --> 35:48.280]  much they were the original slavers of black people I mean I'm sorry I'm just
[35:48.280 --> 35:52.720]  cursed with history Stefan Malinu who is a historian is going to be joining us
[35:52.720 --> 35:57.720]  coming up the second hour from the actual histories of who kicked off the
[35:57.720 --> 36:03.840]  slave trade the modern slave trade post Roman post Byzantine who brought back
[36:03.840 --> 36:15.640]  slavery the North African Muslims and the Saudis it's a historical fact look
[36:15.640 --> 36:20.480]  how they treat women oh by the way photo show gunman shooting Philly cop the
[36:20.480 --> 36:26.000]  name of Islam religion of peace strikes again and Obama's response is of course
[36:26.000 --> 36:31.440]  take our guns we're having a radical Muslim attack now every week or two in
[36:31.440 --> 36:38.000]  the US they had another attack in France yesterday it's just ongoing and it's
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.640]  going to be used to demonize non radical Muslims that's why Lewis Farrakhan says
[36:41.640 --> 36:45.960]  something needs to be done Trump's right because Lewis Farrakhan doesn't actually
[36:45.960 --> 36:52.000]  want to have a race war in this country you say well he used to want one well the
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.960]  interviews coming out wait till you see it it's I can't even get my mind around
[36:55.960 --> 37:00.480]  it I really am actually stunned by it that's why I was telling Farrakhan I
[37:00.480 --> 37:03.320]  said can I have a month to edit this I really want to do a good job and add
[37:03.320 --> 37:10.840]  clips and try to I mean I don't know what to do here it's so powerful and his
[37:10.840 --> 37:13.480]  people want to put it out quicker he said do whatever I want but I'm gonna I'm
[37:13.480 --> 37:16.400]  gonna try to get out my next week because people are already talking about
[37:16.400 --> 37:21.480]  it all over and I actually asked him to be interviewed a month ago till we could
[37:21.480 --> 37:26.160]  try to stop a race war that George Soros is financing and he said absolutely I
[37:26.160 --> 37:30.240]  agree come talk to me and then it was just it was crazy I was there with the
[37:30.240 --> 37:33.520]  entire leadership of the nation of Islam and these guys were super smart I
[37:33.520 --> 37:37.120]  don't mean that condescending like you know black folks they were smart for
[37:37.120 --> 37:40.920]  black folks no I meant like I've never been in a room with people this is
[37:40.920 --> 37:44.080]  stewed about the world and things it was and I've been in the room with like top
[37:44.080 --> 37:52.680]  military people it was wild wild I mean I've been places I was asking I said
[37:52.680 --> 37:58.040]  does anybody get in here I mean who else comes in this in this big room and
[37:58.040 --> 38:03.120]  meets with you guys for three hours he basically said well we're pretty much
[38:03.120 --> 38:10.280]  nobody he said you know Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were sitting when you're
[38:10.280 --> 38:12.720]  sitting last year and all his other famous people but he said we don't
[38:12.720 --> 38:15.840]  really get into all the politics stuff but he thinks it's coming down to the
[38:15.840 --> 38:19.920]  end right now as well and you know I'd rather not fight with people folks I'd
[38:19.920 --> 38:23.400]  rather just live in peace and not all kill each other so a bunch of foreign
[38:23.400 --> 38:28.200]  bankers can make a joke out of it some creepy weird Nazi collaborator we're
[38:28.200 --> 38:33.760]  gonna be played off by him I mean you know it's powerful and I'm not even
[38:33.760 --> 38:37.280]  hyping the interview I want to respect the interview and really do a good job
[38:37.280 --> 38:40.400]  with it make like a documentary out of it but that'll come later I guess we're
[38:40.400 --> 38:45.360]  just gonna churn it out then let me just stop right there let's let's start
[38:45.360 --> 38:54.160]  going to the clips right now President Obama on the conspiracy he's sitting
[38:54.160 --> 38:58.320]  there like it's ridiculous there's a plan to get your guns I mean the unideer
[38:58.320 --> 39:03.400]  UN treaty says that they want the quote abolition of civilian firearm ownership
[39:03.400 --> 39:08.720]  because it threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state July 7th 2000 in
[39:08.720 --> 39:17.360]  the treaty they've taken the guns in almost every country and they always
[39:17.360 --> 39:21.400]  say we just want to register and ban the semi-autos then they start banning
[39:21.400 --> 39:24.600]  more and more then they use the registration list to take the guns and
[39:24.600 --> 39:27.440]  you got to jump through a hundred hoops if you live on a farm to have a single
[39:27.440 --> 39:32.480]  shot shotgun that's what they do in France that's what they do in Australia
[39:32.480 --> 39:37.520]  other areas they've just totally banned them women with no criminal records are
[39:37.520 --> 39:40.640]  trying to go through all the hoops now to get shotguns that have even been
[39:40.640 --> 39:45.160]  raped and the Germans won't let them have them you got to be in a hunting club
[39:45.160 --> 39:53.360]  and keep your gun with the hunting master the Jaeger master the hunting
[39:53.360 --> 39:58.160]  master and then go put your leader hosen on and go hunting see it's not about
[39:58.160 --> 40:04.800]  self-defense it's about hunting no it's not it's about self-defense and I know
[40:04.800 --> 40:08.680]  there's so many clips here but I just can't get over the lying point blank to
[40:08.680 --> 40:19.000]  our faces and telling us that they're not coming for our guns it's just like
[40:19.000 --> 40:25.920]  everything else they do I've never seen such levels of lying let's go to President
[40:25.920 --> 40:32.680]  Obama on the plot to the conspiracy I mean they're sworn to get our guns
[40:32.680 --> 40:37.600]  they're doing it illegally they're saying they'll put you on an extra
[40:37.600 --> 40:42.400]  judicial list with no evidence no court no trial no faces nobody to call and
[40:42.400 --> 40:47.360]  your guns are just taken or you can't buy guns they're already implementing it
[40:47.360 --> 40:53.640]  many areas around the country they're setting up UN bases in every major city
[40:53.640 --> 40:58.840]  under strong city initiative to globalize them and to impact the police
[40:58.840 --> 41:06.280]  and to submitting to them I mean we're being taken over and he sits up there and
[41:06.280 --> 41:12.360]  says nothing's happening nothing's going on let's go ahead and go to this clip
[41:12.360 --> 41:15.880]  here it is is it fair to call it a conspiracy I mean well yeah a lot of
[41:15.880 --> 41:19.960]  people really believe this deeply that they just don't know they just don't
[41:19.960 --> 41:23.680]  trust you I'm sorry Cooper yes it is fair to call the conspiracy what are you
[41:23.680 --> 41:32.760]  saying are the are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot
[41:32.760 --> 41:38.200]  to take everybody's guns away so that we can impose martial law there's a
[41:38.200 --> 41:42.160]  conspiracy yes that is a conspiracy I would hope that you would agree with
[41:42.160 --> 41:47.600]  that pause is that now it's a pause is it controversial that they're
[41:47.600 --> 41:52.600]  developing a plan and that is the most sophisticated double-speak I've ever
[41:52.600 --> 41:57.040]  heard because he's actually being honest going there is a conspiracy see a plot
[41:57.040 --> 42:02.280]  is just an illegal plan so there is a plan it is unconstitutional it is
[42:02.280 --> 42:09.240]  illegal it is dangerous it is tyrannical by every historical measurement so he
[42:09.240 --> 42:12.840]  sits there back it up again this is one of the richest clips I've ever seen and
[42:12.840 --> 42:17.920]  he said listen to him carefully he says is there conspiracy well yeah I mean is
[42:17.920 --> 42:21.360]  there a plot is there to get the guns and then he goes oh it's ridiculous after
[42:21.360 --> 42:31.200]  that he's sitting there talking to a known CIA asset since college he's CIA part
[42:31.200 --> 42:36.400]  of the rogue group that runs it the breakaway globalist the coup d'etat the
[42:36.400 --> 42:39.080]  the occupiers they're not even collaborators because they were never
[42:39.080 --> 42:45.560]  Americans I mean Cooper is is literally sitting on top what is
[42:45.560 --> 42:49.680]  estimated to be over a trillion dollars in assets you hear about Bill Gates a
[42:49.680 --> 42:53.800]  hundred billion this counter billion that's just the public money this guy is
[42:53.800 --> 43:02.600]  related to most the major robber Baron dynasties look it up he's CIA he's a
[43:02.600 --> 43:07.320]  blood-sucking blue blood and he's up there to enslave this country just like
[43:07.320 --> 43:10.960]  the CIA finances dictators to take the weapons in every other country that's
[43:10.960 --> 43:15.000]  what they're doing here it's treason except they're foreign enemies so it's
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.560]  espionage I gotta stop calling Obama treasonous and treacherous he's a
[43:18.560 --> 43:22.960]  globalist operative he's a foreign officer he's involved in espionage and
[43:22.960 --> 43:31.680]  sabotage he is a saboteur literally an enemy how much more naked doesn't have
[43:31.680 --> 43:36.160]  to get let's go back to the clip is it fair to call it a conspiracy I mean well
[43:36.160 --> 43:40.240]  yeah a lot of people really believe this deeply that they just don't know they
[43:40.240 --> 43:44.040]  just don't trust you I'm sorry Cooper yes it is fair to call the
[43:44.040 --> 43:53.480]  real estate the real rose adjusting that the notion that we are creating a plot
[43:53.480 --> 43:58.680]  to take everybody's guns away so that we can impose martial law there's certainly
[43:58.680 --> 44:02.480]  a lot of conspiracy yes that is a conspiracy I would hope that you would
[44:02.480 --> 44:07.480]  agree with that is that controversial except on some website are certainly on
[44:07.480 --> 44:10.260]  the country there are certainly a lot of people who just have a fundamental
[44:10.260 --> 44:15.240]  distrust that you pause do so so see I mean is there a plan to get some guns
[44:15.240 --> 44:20.120]  I think well yeah and and you know these these websites around the country that
[44:20.120 --> 44:29.440]  people believe and listen to because we we show them what a con artist finish the
[44:29.440 --> 44:34.920]  clip it just gets crazier is that controversial except on some website
[44:34.920 --> 44:37.640]  certainly on the country there are certainly a lot of people who just have
[44:37.640 --> 44:43.200]  a fundamental distrust that you do not want to get further and further and
[44:43.200 --> 44:49.920]  further care I mean I'm only gonna be here for another year
[44:49.920 --> 44:58.160]  what when when would I have started on this enterprise day one right I come
[44:58.160 --> 45:03.480]  from the state of Illinois which we've been talking about Chicago but downstate
[45:03.480 --> 45:09.160]  Illinois is is closer to Kentucky but the crime syndicate you run took all the
[45:09.160 --> 45:14.560]  guns total gunman Chicago until the Supreme Court really and oh that's
[45:14.560 --> 45:18.400]  enough shutting down again he keeps acting like because they haven't taken
[45:18.400 --> 45:21.800]  all the guns yet that shows that no one's taking the guns everywhere they
[45:21.800 --> 45:27.040]  run they've taken them all I mean again he's praying on his supporters and I'm
[45:27.040 --> 45:30.680]  sorry man I've looked I'm gonna go out in some videos and just point at crowds
[45:30.680 --> 45:35.280]  in Austin and I mean they're soft they're dumb they're dead-eyed I don't care
[45:35.280 --> 45:38.960]  if they're Hispanic black-white or Asian they're fat and not being mean to fat
[45:38.960 --> 45:42.160]  people none of us are perfect but I mean they look like they haven't worked a day
[45:42.160 --> 45:49.720]  in their lives and can't even wipe their butts their eyes are so weak they're so
[45:49.720 --> 45:55.560]  dead they're helpless that they have no survival instinct and I'll say you say
[45:55.560 --> 45:57.920]  whatever you want about the nation of Islam I disagree with a lot of stuff
[45:57.920 --> 46:01.440]  they've said done but when I was there those people were alive their eyes had
[46:01.440 --> 46:05.440]  fire in them and it might be hate but you know what I'll take some of that hate
[46:05.440 --> 46:10.160]  over death any day being dead and it isn't hate it's anger at being enslaved
[46:10.160 --> 46:13.480]  and I get it well here's the deal I don't want to be a slave either and I'm
[46:13.480 --> 46:19.080]  angry and I'm not rolling over
[46:19.080 --> 46:28.080]  and Donald Trump's not rolling over and our veterans aren't rolling over to be
[46:28.080 --> 46:37.760]  an enslaved let's go ahead and go to clip number three where we need everything
[46:37.760 --> 46:42.360]  to be smart guns which then they use to ban all the previous made guns and then
[46:42.360 --> 46:46.480]  they could deactivate the other guns this is the biggest attack ever and this
[46:46.480 --> 46:50.440]  is what they have neocons on Fox News going you know it's reasonable we're
[46:50.440 --> 46:54.000]  not against that let's do that and that just shut down all the manufacturers in
[46:54.000 --> 47:01.160]  California this year they all just shut this week and are moving out so let's go
[47:01.160 --> 47:04.160]  I mean you love your smart meter ripping you off you love the smart car about the
[47:04.160 --> 47:09.000]  taxi by the mile it's all being announced I warned you 20 years ago because
[47:09.000 --> 47:13.400]  they wrote white papers on it nobody wants to tax you by the mile nobody the
[47:13.400 --> 47:17.000]  smart meters don't rip you off they're not going to control your thermostat now
[47:17.000 --> 47:25.480]  it's all happening they admit it all again this is a lawless president who
[47:25.480 --> 47:28.880]  opened the borders two years ago secretly and orders the Border Patrol to
[47:28.880 --> 47:32.560]  ship the illegals in and then has a few hundred arrested here and there at
[47:32.560 --> 47:39.720]  staged events I think just I mean this is war people this is scientific with two
[47:39.720 --> 47:47.040]  CIA guys on TV lying to you and they legalized it last year because their
[47:47.040 --> 47:50.240]  own people wouldn't follow orders and lie and they said look it's the law now
[47:50.240 --> 47:58.120]  follow orders and so their people just started leaking everything and not just
[47:58.120 --> 48:03.280]  to us but to the Russians and everybody else because there are a lot of people in
[48:03.280 --> 48:08.560]  our government aren't going along with this globalist takeover let's go to the
[48:08.560 --> 48:14.280]  next clip here on the smart guns here it is there's nothing else in our lives
[48:14.280 --> 48:19.600]  that we purchase where we don't try to make it a little safer if we can hit
[48:19.600 --> 48:25.360]  pause that's what the nanny states all about ban dodgeball then ban tag then
[48:25.360 --> 48:30.040]  ban football then ban words then ban the word mom and dad anything might hurt
[48:30.040 --> 48:34.160]  your feelings ban toy guns then they can ban the real thing it's real reasonable
[48:34.160 --> 48:41.040]  let's just make it safer more guns we get the more the crime rate goes down but
[48:41.040 --> 48:47.080]  that's his big lie I'm gonna skip this break here it is traffic fatalities have
[48:47.080 --> 48:53.760]  gone down drastically during my lifetime and part of it is technology and part
[48:53.760 --> 49:00.240]  of it is that the national highway safety administration that's reasonable you
[49:00.240 --> 49:04.640]  know what seatbelts really work that's reasonable that set the precedent for
[49:04.640 --> 49:09.400]  you to power grab airbanks make a lot of sense let's try those out and now they
[49:09.400 --> 49:13.480]  want driverless cars as they say those are states we say you know what we find
[49:13.480 --> 49:20.000]  out the kids are swallowing toys all the time let's make sure that so again most
[49:20.000 --> 49:23.920]  people seven thousand of the deaths every year suicide and then was it three or
[49:23.920 --> 49:27.600]  four thousand pending on the year on average about 12,000 our criminals being
[49:27.600 --> 49:32.400]  shot a couple thousand innocent people die here into the world now it's one of
[49:32.400 --> 49:35.800]  the rarest forms of death but he acts like it's in the world and speaking of
[49:35.800 --> 49:40.040]  that let's go to the widow of Chris Kyle tell on the truth say why don't you
[49:40.040 --> 49:45.200]  celebrate lower murder rate this is a key clip because normally on these shows
[49:45.200 --> 49:50.240]  they they just say gun crimes way up gun and just lie they just lie and then
[49:50.240 --> 49:54.440]  their idiot viewers just believe it because you know skinny CIA officers and
[49:54.440 --> 49:59.480]  fancy suits in big sets are up their line to him let's go ahead and go back to
[49:59.480 --> 50:05.600]  the Navy Seal widow talking to the two foreign enemies here it is we're at an
[50:05.600 --> 50:09.480]  all-time low for murder rate that's a big deal and yet I think most of us in
[50:09.480 --> 50:13.520]  this country feel like it could happen at any moment it happened to any of us at
[50:13.520 --> 50:17.520]  any time and I'm almost finished just when when you talk about the NRA and
[50:17.520 --> 50:20.400]  after a mass shooting that gun sales go up I would argue that it's not
[50:20.400 --> 50:24.080]  necessarily that I think somebody's gonna come take my gun for me but I want
[50:24.080 --> 50:28.520]  the hope and the hope that I have the right to protect myself that I don't
[50:28.520 --> 50:31.360]  end up to be one of these families that I have the freedom to carry whatever
[50:31.360 --> 50:34.880]  weapon I feel I need just like your wife said on that farm road you know I don't
[50:34.880 --> 50:37.720]  the sheriffs aren't gonna get to my house either and I understand that
[50:37.720 --> 50:41.280]  background checks aren't necessarily gonna stop me from getting a gun but I
[50:41.280 --> 50:43.460]  also know that they wouldn't have stopped any of the people here in this
[50:43.460 --> 50:46.960]  room from killing and so it seems like almost a false sense of hope so why not
[50:46.960 --> 50:50.920]  celebrate where we are I guess that's my real question is well celebrate that
[50:50.920 --> 50:54.960]  we're good people and 99.9% of us are never gonna kill anyone well let me
[50:54.960 --> 50:59.680]  make a couple of points first of all thanks to your husband for his service
[50:59.680 --> 51:04.440]  and thank you for for your service because extraordinary heroism he's so
[51:04.440 --> 51:08.320]  upset the obvious killer family have shown didn't take out in protecting all
[51:08.320 --> 51:12.480]  of us and I'm very grateful you love the trip so much why you raping I'm cutting
[51:12.480 --> 51:19.080]  off her number two what you said about murder rates and violent crime generally
[51:19.080 --> 51:23.440]  is something that we don't celebrate enough down 61% that the matter is is
[51:23.440 --> 51:28.560]  that violent crime has been steadily declining except the city's run by you
[51:28.560 --> 51:34.480]  for a pretty long time since 92 punk you wouldn't always know it by watching
[51:34.480 --> 51:40.520]  television yeah and liars like you but overall most cities are much safer than
[51:40.520 --> 51:48.200]  they were 10 years ago I can't believe he just told the truth 20 years ago now I
[51:48.200 --> 51:53.520]  challenge the notion that the reason for that is because there's more gun
[51:53.520 --> 51:58.320]  ownership because if you look at where are the areas with the highest gun
[51:58.320 --> 52:03.000]  ownership those are the places in some cases where the crime rate hasn't dropped
[52:03.000 --> 52:09.480]  down that much and the places where pretty stiff restrictions on gun
[52:09.480 --> 52:14.600]  ownership some of those places the crimes dropped really really name I'm not
[52:14.600 --> 52:19.180]  sure there's a one-to-one correlation there oh really like Keneslaw
[52:19.180 --> 52:22.360]  George and made it the law to own guns and within one year the crime rate
[52:22.360 --> 52:27.840]  dropped 89% or all the states that pass concealed carries on average had over
[52:27.840 --> 52:34.480]  25% crime rate within two years some even higher I mean look at crime maps the
[52:34.480 --> 52:38.320]  areas where they banned the guns have the highest crime rates in the country and
[52:38.320 --> 52:48.480]  Chicago in the world Chicago Tribune the city run by you and your mafia scum and
[52:48.480 --> 52:51.920]  I know I tear into them folks because this is like Hitler in America or
[52:51.920 --> 53:00.560]  Stalin I mean we are in trouble I'm gonna remind you that I have continued to
[53:00.560 --> 53:09.440]  warn you that they're gonna call martial law civil emergency I'm gonna
[53:09.440 --> 53:13.280]  remind you that they call the civil emergency in Germany and Sweden and
[53:13.280 --> 53:16.720]  France with their banning demonstrations against the Islamification in the
[53:16.720 --> 53:21.480]  open borders where they've arrested Le Pen the leader in the presidential polls
[53:21.480 --> 53:25.200]  because she said there's a Muslim invasion where they arrest preachers
[53:25.200 --> 53:31.080]  that criticize it mildly in the UK it's here that's a civil emergency they
[53:31.080 --> 53:34.680]  don't call FEMA camps FEMA camps they call them emergency centers they don't
[53:34.680 --> 53:39.880]  call it martial law they call it state of national emergency I have told you
[53:39.880 --> 53:44.360]  thousands of times they will start calling it that when they're getting
[53:44.360 --> 53:52.040]  ready to hammer and so now we have seen scores of articles the last month saying
[53:52.040 --> 53:56.640]  go ahead and kick Alex Jones off the air he's dangerous go ahead and shut down
[53:56.640 --> 54:00.080]  free speech go ahead and just take the guns go ahead and start a civil war
[54:00.080 --> 54:04.280]  using those terms go ahead and be linking on these people and here's CNN
[54:04.280 --> 54:09.600]  victims father Obama gun actions won't make a dent and you read the quotes CNN
[54:09.600 --> 54:16.800]  op-ed calls for Obama to declare quote national state of emergency national
[54:16.800 --> 54:23.160]  state of emergency national state of emergency I'm gonna say it again
[54:23.160 --> 54:29.000]  national state of emergency we're under a national state of emergency when they
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.680]  spy on us without warrants when the president opens the borders outside of
[54:32.680 --> 54:36.280]  law shuts off our power plants gives thousands of waivers to insiders on
[54:36.280 --> 54:40.720]  Obamacare funds al-qaeda gives them stinger missiles suspends the law does
[54:40.720 --> 54:44.480]  whatever he wants has signing statements more than anybody ever I mean I mean
[54:44.480 --> 54:49.640]  we're in martial law boys and girls it's like we're sitting in the pig knees
[54:49.640 --> 54:56.320]  pot we're sitting in the globalist pot we're sitting in the wicked witches pot
[54:56.320 --> 55:00.280]  and she just started building a fire like that smoke smells good it's kind of
[55:00.280 --> 55:04.200]  warm on my feet in the water she's cutting carrots she's cutting onions you
[55:04.200 --> 55:09.000]  like that sweetie you're gonna enjoy it and they're sitting there putting broth
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.400]  in you're like man that's kind of burning she's like let me put the top on

[55:17.400 --> 55:20.680]  out to chain you inside the pot I'm like get out of the pot
[55:20.680 --> 55:26.320]  there's no pot there's nothing going on I love Obamacare man my medical bills
[55:26.320 --> 55:36.440]  went up it's incredible so let's go to this clip how would government
[55:36.440 --> 55:41.480]  confiscate 350 million guns well they're gonna have a whole persecution of gun
[55:41.480 --> 55:45.120]  owners they're going to just band band band and say you've got a right to have
[55:45.120 --> 55:48.960]  that single shot but you know the groups with the semi-autos they've been
[55:48.960 --> 55:52.280]  connected to the terror attacks on police the bombing of federal buildings
[55:52.280 --> 55:56.520]  where we're rounding them up and if your city doesn't go along or your state
[55:56.520 --> 56:00.520]  we're turning the power off the main Pentagon training manuals that are
[56:00.520 --> 56:04.760]  public brigade homeland you name it are to take over the states during quote
[56:04.760 --> 56:09.720]  insurrection by the legislatures like the governor Greg Abbott coming out and
[56:09.720 --> 56:13.200]  saying holding up his gun and saying come and take it Texas is not gonna turn
[56:13.200 --> 56:16.520]  in the guns we're not gonna follow in constitutional executive orders other
[56:16.520 --> 56:21.640]  governors hundreds of sheriffs police chiefs and the globalists are a literal

[56:33.440 --> 56:38.160]  gadgetry and electricity they can cut it off and make a submit the problem is
[56:38.160 --> 56:45.000]  they know the troops aren't gonna go along with it so they're trying to go
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.480]  to robots and drones and autonomous systems right now but we've got them in
[56:48.480 --> 56:53.080]  check if we just realized we can defeat them thank God for the Patriots for 50

[57:14.320 --> 57:18.240]  truth and they knew if the folks got the info out they'd fail and so they had
[57:18.240 --> 57:22.280]  persecuted tens of thousands of Americans they tortured congressmen like
[57:22.280 --> 57:26.720]  Hanson you wouldn't believe it folks what they've done to everybody it's been

[1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:29.080]  jones
[1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:37.360]  all right here's a clip for the obama talks about the paranoia of america of
[1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:41.080]  some distant enemy as if it was delusional the tyranny of the British
[1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:44.480]  that probably killed more people in history I'm not bashing the British I'm
[1:00:44.480 --> 1:00:48.320]  obviously part English that is here they were a dominant empire that made the
[1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:53.360]  Roman Empire look look sweetie cake and people rebelled in England they rebelled
[1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:57.520]  here and so obama kind of halfway attacks it but then you got him last
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:00.880]  year at West Point saying I'm sick of hearing about tyranny always around the
[1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:03.440]  corner and you don't trust your government you're gonna have a problem
[1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:09.640]  well if it isn't my government and it's waging war on me I'd be a moron to bend
[1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:14.920]  over to all these billionaires that are tax exempt telling me to turn my guns
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:19.600]  in well they got bodyguards shut up I see right through you man come on stop
[1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:23.520]  lying to me I'm not one of your little gibbering slaves that can't even hardly
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:34.000]  walk or talk stop trying to conquer a scum now let's go ahead and go to this
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.880]  clip where Mark Kelly earlier mama talks about the conspiracy got our guns
[1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:42.000]  and go yeah there is a conspiracy very bizarre double-speak but here's Mark
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:46.640]  Kelly and then I've got Obama earlier at West Point here this often what you
[1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:51.200]  hear in the debate of expanding background checks to more gun sales and
[1:01:51.200 --> 1:01:56.400]  as you know Gabby and I are 100% behind the concept of somebody getting a
[1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:01.080]  background check before buying a gun the shooters all background in front of
[1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:06.400]  the Senate Judiciary Committee we heard not only from the gun lobby but from
[1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:10.560]  United States senators expanding background check calling for stuff
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:15.320]  they've already got will lead to a registry which will lead to confiscation
[1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:20.360]  which will lead to a tyrannical government yes so I would like you to
[1:02:20.360 --> 1:02:30.880]  explain with 350 million guns in 65 million places households from Key West
[1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:37.440]  to Alaska 350 million objects in 65 million places if the federal
[1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:42.960]  government wanted to confiscate those objects how would they do that what I
[1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:47.320]  think Mark is alluding to is what I said earlier this notion of a conspiracy
[1:02:47.320 --> 1:02:53.760]  out there and it gets wrapped up in concerns about the federal government
[1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:58.880]  now there's a long history of that that's in our DNA you know the United
[1:02:58.880 --> 1:03:05.320]  States was was born suspicious of some distant authority that's why it turned
[1:03:05.320 --> 1:03:08.600]  out to be the most successful because it wasn't a bunch of chumps a nation of
[1:03:08.600 --> 1:03:14.120]  sheep will be ruled by people like you wolves and your trillionaire boyfriend
[1:03:14.120 --> 1:03:19.320]  Anderson Cooper I mean just literally folks I mean these people are just scum
[1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:23.840]  because they're social engineering and and class warfaring all day one of the
[1:03:23.840 --> 1:03:31.520]  richest people in the world tax-exempt filth I'm sorry now let's go to Obama
[1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:36.240]  at West Point we're really getting into how dare you say turnies around the
[1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:38.800]  corner here it is
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:44.800]  hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some
[1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:50.560]  separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems some of these
[1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:55.120]  same votes voices also do their best to gum up the works they'll warn that
[1:03:55.120 --> 1:04:00.640]  tyranny is always lurking just around the corner you should reject these
[1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:05.480]  voices and by the way that was Ohio State I just said find the West Point
[1:04:05.480 --> 1:04:08.520]  clip where he says that they found that when I that's right there's a bunch of
[1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:12.960]  them and his clips where he says I just can't be a dictator and do whatever I
[1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:21.400]  want outside of Congress on guns they got to do it now he's saying oh we are now
[1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:29.680]  when we come back I've got Obama warning of executive power grabs Bush and how
[1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:32.960]  he's a constitutional lawyer he knows what's bad versus what he's doing now
[1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:36.280]  and then we have a clip of some of his lies very small group of them because we
[1:04:36.280 --> 1:04:40.160]  take hours to cover them all literally I keep using the word literally because
[1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:44.800]  I'm honest I mean for real ladies and gentlemen and then we've got Steph on
[1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:52.520]  Malinum on the Gigantor rape fest well now we weren't it's much worse than we

[1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:30.120]  point of broadening his focus beyond the early primary states showcasing his
[1:05:30.120 --> 1:05:34.240]  popularity with packed rallies from Mississippi to Massachusetts and now
[1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:39.040]  Vermont a one-time Republican bastion that is now one of the most solid

[1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:33.960]  What is Obama doing right now? He's breaking the law, breaking the
[1:08:33.960 --> 1:08:37.840]  Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence. He said
[1:08:37.840 --> 1:08:44.240]  countless times as president and before he was president that presidents
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:49.640]  circumventing Congress with executive actions that mimic laws is very
[1:08:49.640 --> 1:08:55.240]  dangerous and tyrannical but now we have a blackmailed Supreme Court we have an
[1:08:55.240 --> 1:08:59.960]  intimidated Congress working with the neocon Rhino Republicans who wrote
[1:08:59.960 --> 1:09:03.960]  Obamacare and all these other screw jobs opening our borders flooding us with
[1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:08.960]  all these populations to be new socialist client-state people we're in
[1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:14.920]  deep trouble and the last hour I played clips of Obama saying is there a
[1:09:14.920 --> 1:09:19.360]  conspiracy to take your guns well yeah there's a conspiracy very bizarre
[1:09:19.360 --> 1:09:23.600]  statement with Anderson Cooper and saying you know these websites out there
[1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:29.480]  that say martial law is coming well look right here CNN op-ed calls for Obama
[1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:34.760]  to declare national state of emergency to gut the Second Amendment and we've
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:38.920]  seen the Daily Beast Salon and countless other groups directly connected to the
[1:09:38.920 --> 1:09:44.640]  White House putting the talking point out about a civil emergency and that is a
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:50.800]  civil emergency when the president just says I don't need Congress I'll shut
[1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:54.240]  down power plants I don't need Congress I'll just bring a legals in Congress won't
[1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:58.480]  act I played the clip yesterday they won't get in line so I'm taking action
[1:09:58.480 --> 1:10:02.920]  and folks when they're done they'll take everything down to revolvers down to
[1:10:02.920 --> 1:10:06.320]  single shots they've done it everywhere else they've done it in every city they
[1:10:06.320 --> 1:10:10.520]  control but they're going to have taxpayer bodyguards the rich Hollywood
[1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:14.840]  types they're gonna have the armored car that parks down the street the the arm
[1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:21.000]  defense company that Pierce Morgan had in LA turned out the bills were
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:25.400]  something like eight grand a month to from the time he got home at during the
[1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:30.840]  day until he got up and left 12 to 14 hours a day an armored car with guys
[1:10:30.840 --> 1:10:40.400]  with submachine guns and shotguns but he wants your guns I mean open no one
[1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:46.560]  wants your guns no one's coming for your guns and then all these bizarre
[1:10:46.560 --> 1:10:51.480]  statements about well it's in our DNA you know to be fearful of some far-and-remove
[1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:56.400]  group yeah that would press you into slavery on the ship as a I mean it went
[1:10:56.400 --> 1:11:00.600]  on and on that would that would not let you have a letter to do business unless
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:03.880]  you were an insider I mean so many hundreds of corrupt things under the
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:08.120]  British crown that the whole world was revolting against including in England
[1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:11.520]  at the time and then just Obama it's all a joke I played those clips last hour
[1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:15.000]  but I'll play two clips and go to our guest and it ties into all of this
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:20.520]  because we've had another radical jihadi we'll put it up on screen run up and
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:25.640]  shoot a police officer on video saying he did it for Islam photo show gunman
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:29.560]  shooting Philly cop in the name of Islam religion of peace strikes again
[1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:36.200]  shocking moment the police officer shots fired I'm shot I'm bleeding heavily
[1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:42.600]  our net is heard yelling on police radio and a guy in a Muslim outfit runs up
[1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:48.360]  shooting and this is what MSNBC and George Soros are pushing and then when
[1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:51.800]  they do this when they import people from the third world who all kill each
[1:11:51.800 --> 1:11:56.800]  other the worst radical Muslim areas they say you got to turn your guns in
[1:11:56.800 --> 1:12:00.280]  now because we're getting hit by radical Islam and they call the San Bernardino
[1:12:00.280 --> 1:12:04.160]  attack you know a right-wing shooting for two days remember ordering the FBI to
[1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:07.800]  lie and turns out the FBI was on these folks two years before they were going
[1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:11.280]  to training camps and then they were investigated for being racist by the
[1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:16.480]  Justice Department they want to bring the jihadis in who aren't compatible
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:20.200]  anywhere in the world including their own countries I mean these are the scum
[1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:23.400]  of the Middle East going to rape and kill in Syria they got their butts kicked
[1:12:23.400 --> 1:12:26.720]  they run into Europe through Turkey their ally and then come right in and
[1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:31.000]  Merkel says rape and kill whoever you want I've got stacks of news now where
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:34.440]  the police are actually admitting they were ordered to cover it up mass rapes
[1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:39.000]  beatings killings I mean this is nuts and then they use the crisis to declare
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  states of emergency in Europe and take their rights just like they're getting
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:48.480]  ready to do here they'll never call it martial law refugee crisis why aren't
[1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:52.680]  Gulf States taking them in because they are the criminals and others they just
[1:12:52.680 --> 1:12:56.120]  show the few women here and there like they're so sweet to sell the idea but
[1:12:56.120 --> 1:13:00.600]  it's 80 plus percent military age men now I'm gonna stop there let's go to this
[1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:04.280]  clip this compilation of Obama before he was a president and when he was a
[1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:09.360]  president saying you can't have executive orders outside of Congress that
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:15.080]  deal with major law and policy versus what he's doing now here it is I will
[1:13:15.080 --> 1:13:21.040]  close Guantanamo I will restore habeas court Guantanamo that's easy close down
[1:13:21.040 --> 1:13:24.120]  Guantanamo restore habeas corpus
[1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:42.240]  now that's from the lie clip from Obama deception we're gonna go to the other one
[1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:47.720]  now this is the grip of clips on Obama on executive power here it is there's
[1:13:47.720 --> 1:13:53.040]  been a tendency on the part of this administration to to try to hide behind
[1:13:53.040 --> 1:13:57.720]  executive privilege every time there's something a little shaky that's taking
[1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:02.200]  place and I think you know the administration would be best served by
[1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:06.320]  coming clean on this it's not actually true that the Patriot Act was the worst
[1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:10.760]  most of the problems that we have had in civil liberties were not done through the
[1:14:10.760 --> 1:14:14.520]  Patriot Act they were done through executive order by George W. Bush and I
[1:14:14.520 --> 1:14:20.480]  think one of the biggest problems of the last eight years has been the degree to
[1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:29.720]  which President Bush has taken almost the opposite tack that secrecy and
[1:14:29.720 --> 1:14:33.960]  concentrations of power in the Oval Office I taught the Constitution for 10
[1:14:33.960 --> 1:14:38.200]  years I believe in the Constitution I will obey the Constitution of the United
[1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:42.240]  States we're not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an end run
[1:14:42.240 --> 1:14:47.640]  around Congress and I'm gonna play the lie compilation later while our guest is
[1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:51.520]  on with someone get started with that and then we can actually go to his clip
[1:14:51.520 --> 1:14:57.760]  from Monday where he says I'm a constitutional lawyer and I know I can
[1:14:57.760 --> 1:15:02.520]  do these executive orders cuz Congress won't get in line that's quote I mean
[1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:06.560]  this is so naked I wonder what's coming next I mean this is really getting
[1:15:06.560 --> 1:15:09.840]  bizarre oh land and he's clearly responding to us to drudge and others
[1:15:09.840 --> 1:15:13.280]  because these websites claiming we want martial law claim we want to take your
[1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:17.520]  guns is their conspiracy well yeah we won't stop the problem I guess there is
[1:15:17.520 --> 1:15:23.040]  I mean it's getting really weird and then you tie into this the massive Muslim
[1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:27.560]  influx from areas that are run by radicals who can't even live in peace
[1:15:27.560 --> 1:15:32.880]  with each other I mean if they rape a woman then they kill the woman so that's
[1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:36.560]  the view of women and the feminist in Germany are saying it's white German
[1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:41.600]  men's fault they actually say this it's bizarre cologne sex attacks suspects
[1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:45.160]  found with note I kill you I want to have sex with you and they hand this to
[1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:50.240]  the women unprecedented sex harassment in Helsinki at New Year's finished
[1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:56.840]  police report and it goes on and on and on cologne suspects include 18 asylum
[1:15:56.840 --> 1:16:01.600]  seekers Afghan woman barbarically lynched after being falsely accused of
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:07.440]  burning Korean German refugee numbers rise so do rapes two teenage girls gang
[1:16:07.440 --> 1:16:12.080]  raped by four Syrian nationals in southern Germany severely beaten noses
[1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:17.080]  broken well that's a sacrament of the liberals suspects in cologne sex attacks
[1:16:17.080 --> 1:16:21.440]  claim to be Syrian refugees Merkel comes out and says you got to accept them
[1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:24.840]  there's actual video of it and the mayor says you need to learn to fight back or
[1:16:24.840 --> 1:16:30.200]  not dress so sexy she actually said that you're you need to keep moth you now
[1:16:30.200 --> 1:16:34.520]  a German does that he gets 20 years in prison starts to rape you but hey that's
[1:16:34.520 --> 1:16:39.880]  a white guy ISIS in Syria mother publicly executed by her jihad son for
[1:16:39.880 --> 1:16:44.000]  abandoning Islam I'm sure that's America's fault Merkel flashback Germans
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:47.320]  have to accept migrant crime wave actually says it takes he says that except
[1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:54.080]  crime Europe is committing demographic and cultural suicide I'm gonna stop right
[1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:57.760]  there but to talk about the big picture for this segment the gun grab all of it
[1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:01.440]  step on my own and then at the bottom of the hour we'll keep a little bit in the
[1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:05.800]  next and then our next guest is coming on we're going to look at the history
[1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:08.280]  that I saw a great viral video he did we're gonna tell you about we're gonna
[1:17:08.280 --> 1:17:12.040]  post it on info wars calm by the way right now and tweeted out a real Alex
[1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:18.360]  Jones dealing with the real history of slavery Christian and Muslim both groups
[1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:22.000]  are guilty but the other group about four times worse from my estimate and then
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:27.280]  also who really started the more modern one after the Rome fell and more
[1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:33.400]  importantly the Crusades we're always heard it was an invasion okay that's
[1:17:33.400 --> 1:17:37.800]  just I mean I'm a I'm a history guy too it's all well known it's riveting stuff
[1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:41.740]  the Muslims are very proud the fact that they started it all you know now
[1:17:41.740 --> 1:17:45.560]  the Canadian government when it welcomes and plays the jihad anthem in
[1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:49.880]  Canada you know about the great conquering of Constantinople so joining
[1:17:49.880 --> 1:17:55.080]  us is fellow threat criminal Stefan Malinu hosted founder of free domain
[1:17:55.080 --> 1:18:00.160]  radio and reaches hundreds of millions of people youtube.com for free
[1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:05.360]  domain radio Twitter Stefan Malinu free domain radio.com and he joins us I'm
[1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:08.720]  gonna skip this break last one of the week I promise I'm out of control hey
[1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:12.360]  who was just blow thousands of dollars whatever point is to support us folks
[1:18:12.360 --> 1:18:16.560]  by stuff in four store.com gcmlive.com support sponsors but I just have to
[1:18:16.560 --> 1:18:20.840]  skip this to give him more time Stefan this is reaching insane asylum level
[1:18:20.840 --> 1:18:24.440]  what do you think the cultural leader trying to do because clearly it's an
[1:18:24.440 --> 1:18:29.080]  organized plan the same thing in Europe same thing here I mean has common
[1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:32.360]  sense been suspended because they don't get in trouble when they bring in 3
[1:18:32.360 --> 1:18:36.000]  million refugees and they start burning murdering and killing they get more
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:40.880]  power I mean what's happening here well you know first of all I just want to
[1:18:40.880 --> 1:18:44.120]  say happy new year to you and your listeners and to say that it sort of
[1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:49.000]  feels like for me three decades of preparation is coming down to one and
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:53.520]  only one year and that is this year where the maximum effort must be put out
[1:18:53.520 --> 1:18:57.240]  to reach people with ideas of liberty and volunteerism and freedom and so on
[1:18:57.240 --> 1:19:01.160]  because it seems like events are accelerating at a crazy snowball fashion
[1:19:01.160 --> 1:19:05.120]  and now is the time where we really need to stand tall and push back it feels
[1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:08.640]  it feels to me like it's all coming down to this year and the micron crisis in
[1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:14.000]  the in Europe is one of the great aspects of that it is not a bunch of
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:20.120]  migrants fleeing war look the closest European country to Syria is Cyprus just
[1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:25.240]  a couple of dozen miles off the coast and the refugees are not going to Cyprus
[1:19:25.240 --> 1:19:29.040]  why because Cyprus will not allow the refugees to bring in family members the
[1:19:29.040 --> 1:19:33.960]  million that Angela Merkel has invited into Germany are merely the tip of the
[1:19:33.960 --> 1:19:37.480]  spear because they're going to be family reunification policies that allow
[1:19:37.480 --> 1:19:41.480]  allow them to bring in millions and millions of more Lithuania has a small
[1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:45.760]  welfare state and Lithuania has thrown its gates wide to invite these migrants
[1:19:45.760 --> 1:19:50.600]  in and they're not going to Lithuania they're hip-hopping over many countries
[1:19:50.600 --> 1:19:57.440]  whether or not under threat they can find at they're the tow hooks they're
[1:19:57.440 --> 1:20:01.720]  the launch cables when the pirates come to your ship they're the anchor people
[1:20:01.720 --> 1:20:06.800]  to bring in the next mega wave please continue well so that's really really
[1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:11.120]  important understand and we don't have the historical view of Islam that is
[1:20:11.120 --> 1:20:15.880]  characterized by the history of the crusades look Christianity was a Middle
[1:20:15.880 --> 1:20:19.320]  Eastern religion the European religions like the old Norse religions with
[1:20:19.320 --> 1:20:23.360]  Ragnarok and so on Christianity is a Middle Eastern religion and how many
[1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:27.080]  Christian countries are there left in the Middle East accounting like if you
[1:20:27.080 --> 1:20:34.760]  accept a little bit in Lebanon not because Islam is a radical expansionist
[1:20:34.760 --> 1:20:40.120]  ideology to say that Islam a really is a religion is like saying communism is a
[1:20:40.120 --> 1:20:45.240]  poll is a an economic system it is not true Islam is a combination of religion
[1:20:45.240 --> 1:20:48.920]  and a highly expansionist political ideology and highly expansionist is
[1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:52.440]  putting it mildly saying that Islam is somewhat expansionist is saying like a
[1:20:52.440 --> 1:20:56.640]  supernova is somewhat expansionist Islam of course in the in the seventh
[1:20:56.640 --> 1:20:59.560]  century was founded by the end of the seventh century had taken over most of
[1:20:59.560 --> 1:21:03.280]  North Africa and all of the Middle East it is an incredibly expansionist
[1:21:03.280 --> 1:21:08.400]  ideology it seeks one world domination just as communism did and the fact is
[1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:11.000]  that of course the first couple of Muslims are going to be nice because
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:15.320]  they have to wait to get the numbers up in order to begin to affect the kind of
[1:21:15.320 --> 1:21:19.920]  social change when the Islamists first got their toll holds and then entire
[1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:26.440]  countries taken over in Europe it took over 700 years of brutal medieval
[1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:32.240]  battle to drive the Islamic population out of Europe and the Islamic's of course
[1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:37.480]  were taking millions of Europeans mostly through piracy into the slave trade the
[1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:42.320]  Islamists are 14 centuries of the slave trade but the death count that has been
[1:21:42.320 --> 1:21:50.200]  estimated at over 110 million souls so here to show how deep this invasion
[1:21:50.200 --> 1:21:55.560]  went and of course they'll call this racist just to give a cultural point
[1:21:55.560 --> 1:22:01.600]  that's why southern Italy Greece southern Europe eastern Europe Spain is no
[1:22:01.600 --> 1:22:05.920]  longer blonde-haired blue-eyed all the way up into Poland that's how far the
[1:22:05.920 --> 1:22:11.880]  invasions went in Poland in Hungary I mean millions dying giant full-out wars
[1:22:11.880 --> 1:22:15.760]  and when the Muslims came in they would kill all the men even if they converted
[1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:20.720]  at first the Christians didn't care and weren't fighting back but the Muslims
[1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:24.840]  were killing everybody putting them to the sword loading the women into
[1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:30.160]  slave ships and that's all in mainline history the Muslims celebrate it their
[1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:35.160]  imams say we're coming for your women now weak scum and the socialist left says
[1:22:35.160 --> 1:22:41.640]  yes come I want to ask you why does the socialist left want to I mean Europe's
[1:22:41.640 --> 1:22:44.200]  already dead it's already not having kids I mean why not replace it with
[1:22:44.200 --> 1:22:48.680]  Brazilians or something why do you want to replace it with not even the less
[1:22:48.680 --> 1:22:53.800]  radical Muslims why bring in the absolute scum well this goes all the way
[1:22:53.800 --> 1:23:00.000]  back to Trotsky and the origins origins of the communist party in Russia and the
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:03.320]  desire of the communists and the leftist to take over the world to destroy
[1:23:03.320 --> 1:23:07.520]  capitalism to destroy free markets to destroy limited constitutional republics
[1:23:07.520 --> 1:23:11.200]  that is the thought in the side of socialism the fact that socialist
[1:23:11.200 --> 1:23:14.680]  countries do badly economically and capitalist or more free-market countries
[1:23:14.680 --> 1:23:18.680]  do very well meant that they could not spread their ideology by appealing to
[1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:22.000]  people's self-interest like hey have you had enough iPhones would you like a
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:25.560]  gulag or two it doesn't really work with the world's population to try and
[1:23:25.560 --> 1:23:30.200]  sell them on the benefits of communism or extreme socialism so this was a plan
[1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:33.920]  adopted in the 1920s by the communist party it was very clear it was very
[1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:39.240]  simple and the idea was to jam as many radically incompatible cultures into
[1:23:39.240 --> 1:23:43.200]  Europe and North America as humanly possible and then watch the civil wars
[1:23:43.200 --> 1:23:46.080]  erupt and that was what was going to destroy the remnants of freedom in the
[1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:49.480]  West which has been their goal for coming on a century and they admit it
[1:23:49.480 --> 1:23:53.440]  they write books on it here we are so time frame how's it going for them and
[1:23:53.440 --> 1:23:57.440]  then let's get into the history of what really happened with the crusades and
[1:23:57.440 --> 1:24:02.840]  then what is expansionist Islam is well the time frame is that they're doing
[1:24:02.840 --> 1:24:07.120]  very well hopefully with people like us to stand up and fight against that
[1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:10.800]  particular approach we'll be able to stop them but their time frame is that
[1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:15.160]  it's going very well of course Angela Merkel decided to allow these million
[1:24:15.160 --> 1:24:18.920]  Muslim quote refugees although the vast majority of them are young military age
[1:24:18.920 --> 1:24:23.680]  men who are not fleeing from war-torn countries but simply looking for the
[1:24:23.680 --> 1:24:28.080]  welfare state she invited them in of course by disobeying the law the law is
[1:24:28.080 --> 1:24:31.920]  in Europe that you have to seek asylum in the first country you get to you can't
[1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:36.040]  leapfrog to get to the country that you want she changed that rule and she
[1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:41.880]  allowed Germans migrants into Germany to appeal for asylum without having to go
[1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:45.280]  through the stop at the first country they got to so this is why people are
[1:24:45.280 --> 1:24:48.880]  pouring into Germany and this is why it's the young military age men who if
[1:24:48.880 --> 1:24:52.000]  they were Europeans as in World War two would be staying to fight the
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:54.560]  dictatorships in their own country rather than fleeing and attempting to
[1:24:54.560 --> 1:24:59.520]  spread a fairly vile sharia-based ideology to the rest of the West but
[1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:03.560]  their their acceleration is going beautifully and it is only a few
[1:25:03.560 --> 1:25:07.360]  truth tellers who stand between this process and the end of Western
[1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:12.560]  civilization and the socialist and communist and social engineers hate the
[1:25:12.560 --> 1:25:17.720]  West so much because it stood in the way of their total control that they would
[1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:22.280]  join with radical Islam which will slit their throat in a second but I guess
[1:25:22.280 --> 1:25:25.160]  they don't care because I think it'll take another generation or so they just
[1:25:25.160 --> 1:25:29.800]  want to see Europe fall well I'm sure you are aware of this but the human
[1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:34.280]  lust for power Alex is a physical addiction it releases the same kind of
[1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:38.200]  dopamine that you get out of cocaine and so on so saying well gee I don't know
[1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:41.640]  what their end game is these these are globalists or whatever is like saying
[1:25:41.640 --> 1:25:44.920]  well I don't know why this cocaine addict is acting irrationally because
[1:25:44.920 --> 1:25:49.000]  they just want their next fix their next expansion of power their next gun
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:55.240]  grab their next escalation of some sort of regulation their next reduction of
[1:25:55.240 --> 1:26:00.040]  human liberty it's an addiction and they can't be counted on to stop it
[1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:03.320]  themselves any more than most addicts in the late stage of their addiction can do
[1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:06.840]  it they're hungering for their next fix they're not thinking beyond the next
[1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:10.760]  five minutes of another power grab to feed their addiction hence the word
[1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:15.160]  power hungry you look at George Soros then a Nazi collaborator was an arch war
[1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:19.720]  criminal by you know 15 years old a string of evil overthrowing countries
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:26.520]  impoverishing people all he ever does is evil things and it's just so sick that
[1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:32.520]  they actually get off on this right so I wanted to mention of course that the
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:36.120]  analogy that kind of struck me just just before the show was that a tree without
[1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:40.440]  roots can be easily pushed over and this I think is one of the reasons why the
[1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:44.840]  leftists academics and in particular the myth makers the artists and the
[1:26:44.840 --> 1:26:48.360]  Hollywood types and so on have created the myth of the
[1:26:48.360 --> 1:26:53.240]  evil patriarchal racist slave owning white western christian european
[1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:56.520]  civilization that you're taught to hate everything about your past
[1:26:56.520 --> 1:26:59.800]  and then you have nothing to defend when an antithetical culture
[1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:03.080]  marches over your borders and one of the key things is the crusades the other
[1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:07.000]  thing of course is slavery the crusades were a response to
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:11.160]  multi-century invasions of Europe by the Islamic
[1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:14.280]  religion and the imposition of sharia law Spain fell
[1:27:14.280 --> 1:27:18.120]  Portugal fell they were at the gates of Vienna they were at the gates
[1:27:18.120 --> 1:27:22.120]  repeatedly of Rome and it was in several crucial battles
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:26.280]  that the crusades were fought but it was not an invasion of the Middle East it
[1:27:26.280 --> 1:27:29.640]  was a defense of Europe against Islamic invasions when
[1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:32.920]  three out of the five christian centers had fallen into Islamic hands
[1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:37.160]  when the islamists were at the gates of Vienna that is when the pushback
[1:27:37.160 --> 1:27:40.600]  occurred but this idea that you know these bloodthirsty christians went
[1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:43.320]  along to these innocent muslims who were just minding their own business
[1:27:43.320 --> 1:27:45.960]  and tending their chickens and just started slaughtering them
[1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:50.280]  for fun and kittens makes no sense and is historically completely
[1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:54.440]  inaccurate islam's goal was to conquer europe islam's goal
[1:27:54.440 --> 1:27:58.200]  was being achieved and the christians under the guidance of the pope
[1:27:58.200 --> 1:28:02.520]  finally said deos volz and began to fight back but it was a defensive war
[1:28:02.520 --> 1:28:06.040]  it was not fundamentally a war of imperialism
[1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:09.960]  and that's that's not debated for folks that don't know i mean islamic tv books
[1:28:09.960 --> 1:28:13.960]  they all celebrate this and then they say that's the goal take over again
[1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:17.400]  uh and you will convert or you put to the sword
[1:28:17.400 --> 1:28:21.720]  and then the left just runs around lying saying it's racist to say that
[1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:26.040]  that this is being done well and i think that in europe
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:30.840]  they abandoned christianity and did not replace it with any comparable
[1:28:30.840 --> 1:28:34.760]  moral guidance and so what's happened is i think that a lot of the european
[1:28:34.760 --> 1:28:38.200]  secularists have failed and no longer
[1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:42.040]  fundamentally understand the fundamentalist religious mindset such as
[1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:44.360]  is occurring in many places in the middle east
[1:28:44.360 --> 1:28:47.560]  they don't understand that there are lots of people in the world
[1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:52.440]  who have plans and ambitions that far supersede to sort of shallow materialistic
[1:28:52.440 --> 1:28:55.960]  pleasure seeking that most secular post-religious societies tend to fall
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:28:58.280]  into so they're blind so they say well you know if
[1:28:58.280 --> 1:29:01.880]  we got to europe we'd be happy to just get a job and be nice and so on they do
[1:29:01.880 --> 1:29:06.120]  not understand the the end times massive 72
[1:29:06.120 --> 1:29:09.000]  virgins goals that a lot of fundamentalist islamists have
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:12.120]  and so they fundamentally are miscalculating the depth and nature
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:15.400]  of those who wish their demise and by the way you just hit on it
[1:29:15.400 --> 1:29:18.760]  there is this weird perverted sexual stuff
[1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:23.480]  in most of these jihads where it is about raping and killing and slaving
[1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:25.960]  we're gonna come back into the history of the real slave trade
[1:29:25.960 --> 1:29:29.720]  uh and then cover some of the latest news but i mean it's just mainline history
[1:29:29.720 --> 1:29:32.760]  and they hope we don't know and i'm not here bashing muslims in general
[1:29:32.760 --> 1:29:35.960]  but it can be argued that the non-radical muslims that are being exterminated by
[1:29:35.960 --> 1:29:39.640]  the lohabists as well they're really apostate you know they're
[1:29:39.640 --> 1:29:42.760]  they're not in the religion they're actually fleeing here to be free i know
[1:29:42.760 --> 1:29:46.280]  a lot of muslims that are like that uh but the folks are bringing in now are
[1:29:46.280 --> 1:29:51.800]  blood thirsty we're on the march the empires on the run

[1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:52.360]  can lower the price which we're just paying for the bandwidth to have our own
[1:35:52.360 --> 1:35:57.000]  platform that they can't censor as easily and listen
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:59.640]  people try to make a controversy out of it when i mentioned this they try to
[1:35:59.640 --> 1:36:02.280]  make even bigger controversy out of which i think it's funny the trolls go
[1:36:02.280 --> 1:36:06.200]  after anything they go why are you on facebook
[1:36:06.200 --> 1:36:11.800]  they're evil they track everybody why are you doing videos on facebook
[1:36:11.800 --> 1:36:15.000]  and of course the trolls are just jealous the average video now is getting 500 to
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:19.160]  a million to two million three million i mean it's crazy
[1:36:19.160 --> 1:36:23.000]  that's like saying you know in world war two why why did we invade france
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:27.560]  i mean because that's where hitler said i'm not here to even demonize facebook
[1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:31.160]  it's a platform we don't give facebook anything
[1:36:31.160 --> 1:36:37.080]  we go in and we get the word out we post videos on the facebook platform that
[1:36:37.080 --> 1:36:41.160]  millions watch a day who have never heard the truth
[1:36:41.160 --> 1:36:44.040]  why do the globalist broadcast propaganda at us i mean i can't believe
[1:36:44.040 --> 1:36:47.720]  how amateur people's brains are
[1:36:47.720 --> 1:36:51.320]  because they're trying to influence us we're trying to influence people we're
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:55.080]  countering obama that's why he's saying these websites the internet don't listen
[1:36:55.080 --> 1:36:57.960]  to him specifically talking about us and others
[1:36:57.960 --> 1:37:02.040]  it's ridiculous so i will continue and intensify facebook mentions this
[1:37:02.040 --> 1:37:05.480]  making the establishment so mad that poses his trolls
[1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:09.640]  but really it's a no-brainer but we do have prism planet dot tv
[1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:12.920]  as our original platform that's harder for them to censor
[1:37:12.920 --> 1:37:16.600]  we got hacked and shut down last week they didn't take the sites down but they
[1:37:16.600 --> 1:37:22.760]  started to break in temple wars dot com so we've got lots of platforms youtube
[1:37:22.760 --> 1:37:26.840]  you know google facebook twitter and our twitter got taken over we didn't have it
[1:37:26.840 --> 1:37:29.400]  for a week so we got to have a lot of heads because
[1:37:29.400 --> 1:37:33.240]  we're being attacked but that's how we survive and thrive
[1:37:33.240 --> 1:37:36.280]  you know when a tree's dying in the desert it'll put out a bunch of seeds
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:39.640]  so when there's a next rain there's 50 trees and we're not dying but we're
[1:37:39.640 --> 1:37:43.000]  under attack we're growing but being attacked at the same time so
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:46.600]  we're multiplying new platforms i mean it's like saying to stefa malinu
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:49.480]  what are you doing on google and youtube reaching hundreds of millions of people
[1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:52.920]  you piece of filth you know what are you doing uh what are you doing dropping
[1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:55.960]  leaflets on the radical muslims you know telling them they're in a cult
[1:37:55.960 --> 1:38:00.520]  you know it's just this idea that you're with facebook because you're on it
[1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:05.000]  and i'm not going to facebook folks i sit here in bash zuckerberg with merkel
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:11.080]  to censor free speech i talk about it on there i follow their rules though
[1:38:11.080 --> 1:38:14.040]  so that's the whole issue is i'm going to make google
[1:38:14.040 --> 1:38:17.800]  and youtube and facebook live up to their terms of service i'm going to use
[1:38:17.800 --> 1:38:21.400]  if they about me on cnn i'm going to go on and tear them up
[1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:24.360]  that's what we're doing is engaging them trying to win
[1:38:24.360 --> 1:38:28.280]  there's this idea in liberty movement and in anti-corruption systems
[1:38:28.280 --> 1:38:31.640]  by some people that are just pessimists and losers who just want to bitch about
[1:38:31.640 --> 1:38:34.840]  things and not change things and have excuses for why they're losers
[1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:39.320]  that's not what we are we're here to change the culture what we're selling
[1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:42.680]  is a trillion times better than tyranny like stefan just said what we're
[1:38:42.680 --> 1:38:47.320]  promoting is renaissance and freedom and life extension and going to the stars
[1:38:47.320 --> 1:38:51.160]  and living to be 300 you're not going to have that under the globalist takeover
[1:38:51.160 --> 1:38:54.920]  they want to wall off technology keep it for themselves
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:38:59.080]  so prisonplanet.tv get a membership especially those of you that don't like
[1:38:59.080 --> 1:39:03.000]  facebook i agree we got our own platform prisonplanet.tv
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:07.720]  buy the books buy the videos stefan i am ranting here my friend i want you to
[1:39:07.720 --> 1:39:11.080]  speak about the history of islam slavery this is all
[1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:13.880]  mainline and we're probably going to air your video and getting into other
[1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:17.640]  subjects but separately how dare you be on youtube
[1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:20.840]  and be on an enemy platform why would you do that
[1:39:20.840 --> 1:39:23.720]  i mean why would you write an article the new york times if they let you i mean
[1:39:23.720 --> 1:39:27.000]  i mean that's a dumb question i don't know if your enemy drops
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:30.120]  his weapon do you not touch it i mean that's that's war you know we're in a
[1:39:30.120 --> 1:39:32.680]  battle for people's minds i use whatever i can to reach people
[1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:36.040]  without shame and without guilt i mean other people who are fussed by that can
[1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:39.320]  stay in their basements and not try and save the world that's fine with me
[1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:43.400]  so you just crystallized what i tried to say in five minutes go ahead sorry
[1:39:43.400 --> 1:39:46.440]  i'll do the rest of your show in 35 seconds if you don't mind do it please go
[1:39:46.440 --> 1:39:49.720]  ahead do it so very very briefly okay so when it
[1:39:49.720 --> 1:39:52.840]  comes to slavery the general narrative is the rest of the
[1:39:52.840 --> 1:39:56.040]  world was living you know hugging unicorns kumbaya
[1:39:56.040 --> 1:39:58.920]  everybody giving group hugs playing with puppies in their safe rooms while the
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:01.800]  evil white western european christians were out there enslaving the world and
[1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:03.800]  colonizing and doing all these bad things
[1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:06.760]  therefore give us welfare because you know white guilt is a very minable
[1:40:06.760 --> 1:40:10.280]  resource on the planet sadly because whites suffer from a kind of pathological
[1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:12.920]  altruism that means i will sell you my own
[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:15.560]  children in order to avoid being called racist so
[1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:18.760]  the actual history is quite different really three things to remember
[1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:23.640]  about western slavery number one it was about the shortest period
[1:40:23.640 --> 1:40:26.440]  of slavery in any culture throughout history
[1:40:26.440 --> 1:40:30.600]  slavery was indigenous to african and arab countries before it made its way
[1:40:30.600 --> 1:40:33.720]  to europe slavery was widely practiced by the american
[1:40:33.720 --> 1:40:36.440]  indians long before columbus came to the new world
[1:40:36.440 --> 1:40:42.280]  ethiopia had slavery until yes 1942 saudi arabia until 1962
[1:40:42.280 --> 1:40:47.960]  puru until 68 india until 76 and maritania until 1980 so
[1:40:47.960 --> 1:40:50.920]  it was not very long the big peak of christian slavery
[1:40:50.920 --> 1:40:54.760]  hmm 15 19 18 15 that was sort of the peak
[1:40:54.760 --> 1:40:58.600]  period there have however been 14 centuries of arabic or
[1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:02.440]  or muslim slavery and it's hard to know exactly because the records were
[1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:07.000]  mostly castrated and killed but uh it was about 150 million african
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:10.360]  people about 50 million from other parts of the world vastly exceeding
[1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:13.800]  anything i forgot the muslim slavery they cut the penis and genitals off the
[1:41:13.800 --> 1:41:17.160]  men yeah why are there no blacks with blacks took
[1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:20.920]  100 and sorry if if the middle easterners took 150 million
[1:41:20.920 --> 1:41:24.040]  black africans why are there so few blacks in the middle east well because
[1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:27.240]  80 to 90 percent of them died en route and those who remained
[1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:30.520]  were castrated and if they managed to find escape that and have children with
[1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:33.640]  a local the child was killed so there was massive
[1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:37.320]  genocide of the slaves in the in the muslim countries now of course all
[1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:41.000]  cultures have bad stuff in their history the crest the question is alex
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:44.600]  what is the muslim's current view of that history
[1:41:44.600 --> 1:41:47.560]  are they looking back and saying like the europeans do
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:51.880]  wow we did some bad stuff no look at what isis did in libya targeting blacks
[1:41:51.880 --> 1:41:55.800]  they believe they're subhuman right and so the
[1:41:55.800 --> 1:41:58.840]  and where are the africans going to the islamic countries
[1:41:58.840 --> 1:42:01.640]  demanding reparations demanding preferential treatment demanding
[1:42:01.640 --> 1:42:04.360]  massive resource transfers to them for the history of slavery
[1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:08.120]  because i don't think the muslims feel a huge amount of guilt at least
[1:42:08.120 --> 1:42:11.480]  according to what i've read and i'm sure some individuals do but
[1:42:11.480 --> 1:42:15.320]  there's not that same naval gazing looking in the mirror saying oh me back
[1:42:15.320 --> 1:42:18.440]  the left also spins it when i brought this up in college to throw this in and
[1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:20.840]  says it was different slavery in the middle eastern africa
[1:42:20.840 --> 1:42:25.000]  it was loving like family no it's what you see with women chained up in houses
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:28.600]  with hoods on their heads it's beyond what happened in most western
[1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:32.120]  plantations which i'm not defending i'm just sick of like
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:35.800]  the abject sex slavery white slavery of the Arabs
[1:42:35.800 --> 1:42:40.760]  is legendary well and so number one the the christians practice
[1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:43.720]  slavery for the shortest amount of time number two the christians generally
[1:42:43.720 --> 1:42:49.160]  treated their slaves the best but number three which is also not insignificant
[1:42:49.160 --> 1:42:52.680]  christians ended slavery all around the world
[1:42:52.680 --> 1:42:56.760]  i mean that they they fought they bled they the british invaded a bunch of
[1:42:56.760 --> 1:42:59.800]  countries took thousands of ships you name it would blow your ship up if you
[1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:03.880]  had slaves and and bribed people to give up their slaves
[1:43:03.880 --> 1:43:07.640]  so you know they said old saying that no good deed goes unpunished
[1:43:07.640 --> 1:43:10.760]  if you want to look generally at the best culture throughout history you've
[1:43:10.760 --> 1:43:14.120]  got to put on this weird inverse lens you got to look at things kind of upside
[1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:16.680]  down the culture that is criticized in the modern
[1:43:16.680 --> 1:43:19.480]  world is almost always the culture that has done the most good
[1:43:19.480 --> 1:43:23.880]  and the ending of slavery after untold tens of thousands of years of its practice
[1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:27.800]  among humanity was if if not the most one of the greatest moral
[1:43:27.800 --> 1:43:30.760]  triumphs in history and now the only culture the
[1:43:30.760 --> 1:43:35.240]  only race the only religion that is demonized for slavery is that exact
[1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:38.440]  same religion that ended it creating the greatest
[1:43:38.440 --> 1:43:41.800]  moral crusade that the world has ever benefited from and bringing untold
[1:43:41.800 --> 1:43:44.280]  wealth and liberty to human beings around the world
[1:43:44.280 --> 1:43:47.560]  so it is completely ridiculous to say well white people ought to feel bad for
[1:43:47.560 --> 1:43:50.120]  slavery it's like they're the only and by the way
[1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:53.480]  for liberals that are brainwashed just but around the world well for liberals
[1:43:53.480 --> 1:43:56.360]  that are brainwashed and just tuned in and can't believe this
[1:43:56.360 --> 1:44:00.040]  this is mainline history this is un this is not what you're saying is
[1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:03.800]  is in mainline history books well and europe
[1:44:03.800 --> 1:44:07.080]  you know why were there castles in europe everyone thinks it's because of
[1:44:07.080 --> 1:44:10.360]  internecine european warfare no that was the 20th century but what
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:14.280]  there were castles because of muslim slave raiders uh the entire tracts of
[1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:17.480]  europe especially around the coast had to be abandoned
[1:44:17.480 --> 1:44:21.720]  and in the coast of spain and italy was abandoned because of islamic raiders
[1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:24.760]  who were taking uh outputs of a million europeans
[1:44:24.760 --> 1:44:30.200]  in into slavery parts of spain and italy were abandoned on the coast until
[1:44:30.200 --> 1:44:34.040]  the 19th century it is that reason that it is that
[1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:37.880]  to that degree let's go further thomas jefferson our third president had to
[1:44:37.880 --> 1:44:41.560]  launch a giant navel flotilla over two years
[1:44:41.560 --> 1:44:46.280]  just to be able to get any goods into the Mediterranean
[1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:50.040]  and and into other areas there in the indian ocean
[1:44:50.040 --> 1:44:55.880]  i mean no one even knows this that up until the 1900s in the pacific and
[1:44:55.880 --> 1:44:59.320]  around indonesia in places western governments had to pay
[1:44:59.320 --> 1:45:03.320]  bounties to the boobies and the and the pirates boobies aren't breast folks it
[1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:08.440]  means booby trap you pirate muslim pirates there were sultans everywhere
[1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:12.840]  you had to pay until the 19th century right so
[1:45:12.840 --> 1:45:16.120]  this idea that there's some kind of compatibility
[1:45:16.120 --> 1:45:19.640]  between islamic culture and modern western culture
[1:45:19.640 --> 1:45:24.280]  is completely uh insane there there is in a sharia law
[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:27.480]  virtually no separation between church and state of course a separation of
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:30.680]  church and state was one of the great gifts after a century of bloody
[1:45:30.680 --> 1:45:34.920]  religious warfare that the protestant reformation gave
[1:45:34.920 --> 1:45:38.520]  to uh western europe which was saying okay we've got a government the government
[1:45:38.520 --> 1:45:42.040]  is focused upon the prevention ideally of criminality and punishment of criminals
[1:45:42.040 --> 1:45:45.640]  and so on but it is not a mechanism by which you can hijack it
[1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:49.080]  to impose your religious views on others that was a separation of church and
[1:45:49.080 --> 1:45:52.200]  state and i would argue that that gave a great deal of flourishing
[1:45:52.200 --> 1:45:55.880]  to intellectual achievement particularly sort of post renaissance and
[1:45:55.880 --> 1:45:58.200]  into the enlightenment where the battle of ideas
[1:45:58.200 --> 1:46:02.600]  was foundational to the development of of the republic of a limited government
[1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:05.080]  of free market capitalism and that the rights of women
[1:46:05.080 --> 1:46:08.760]  this idea put forward by milton in an article called aria pejitica
[1:46:08.760 --> 1:46:13.000]  that the best way that you get rid of bad ideas is to give the maximum
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:16.120]  exposure you know if you want to see where the roaches are turn the light on
[1:46:16.120 --> 1:46:19.640]  and so the idea that uh we should have a vigorous public debate
[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:23.880]  that all ideas should be able to fight their way into the battle
[1:46:23.880 --> 1:46:28.600]  ground of human ideas a uniquely western concept does not really exist anywhere
[1:46:28.600 --> 1:46:32.040]  in the middle and is now under attack simultaneously
[1:46:32.040 --> 1:46:35.640]  with them supporting it the islamicist ending free speech all over europe at
[1:46:35.640 --> 1:46:39.400]  universities and here and it's muslim groups in the uk driving to have
[1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:43.560]  donald trump banned from entering the uk he says fine i won't invest
[1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:47.000]  anymore of the 700 million i was planning in golf courses
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:50.520]  and they call him a terrorist they say give us your money but you're not allowed
[1:46:50.520 --> 1:46:55.400]  to be here you don't have free speech well this is how oh man i could i could
[1:46:55.400 --> 1:46:59.160]  chew my microphone into pieces on this one alex because this is so insane
[1:46:59.160 --> 1:47:03.720]  the idea that um donald trump says let's put a pause on muslim immigration until
[1:47:03.720 --> 1:47:06.760]  we figure out what's going on after san bernadino shootings
[1:47:06.760 --> 1:47:10.600]  and then the muslim response in england is basically say let's ban donald trump
[1:47:10.600 --> 1:47:13.720]  from coming into england it's like well how do you argue against someone
[1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:16.600]  who's arguing for banning people from coming to your country by demanding
[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:20.040]  that someone be banned from your country this is the kind of unbelievable
[1:47:20.040 --> 1:47:24.120]  insanity that passes for thought in these kinds of areas it's so ridiculously
[1:47:24.120 --> 1:47:27.480]  hypocritical and very few people have commented on that basic fact
[1:47:27.480 --> 1:47:30.760]  you're right they're saying it's wrong try to ban people so we ban you for your
[1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:33.880]  speech not claiming you're dangerous just banning your speech but by the way
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:36.760]  you've got to give us your money and some groups are calling for seizing as
[1:47:36.760 --> 1:47:40.520]  golf courses but what i do love and there's not
[1:47:40.520 --> 1:47:44.120]  much to love about the situation as i'm sure you well know but what i do love
[1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:49.160]  is the degree to which it is illuminating things like feminism and leftism
[1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:54.760]  and their complete hypocrisy and lack of yeah why are major german feminists from
[1:47:54.760 --> 1:47:58.200]  mayors do you name it defending the rapist
[1:47:58.200 --> 1:48:02.200]  well keep an arms length from people in your own country
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:05.160]  i mean you know in germany you try and keep an arms length they think you're
[1:48:05.160 --> 1:48:08.920]  saluting hitler they'll throw you in jail you can't keep an arms length on the
[1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:13.800]  subway you can't keep on an airplane in an in a lineup keeping it all lining up
[1:48:13.800 --> 1:48:17.640]  for a concert what would they supposed to keep an arms length from everyone
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:21.400]  in the paris concert but these guys went and shot up over 130 people
[1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:25.560]  this idea that somehow it's become a mark of freedom to keep an arms length
[1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:29.000]  from everyone around you and nobody's saying something has gone
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:32.840]  vastly awry and this is a woman she also said watch how you dress
[1:48:32.840 --> 1:48:36.360]  i mean that's the classic deal watch how you dress
[1:48:36.360 --> 1:48:39.320]  well and say that the west has been the best of women
[1:48:39.320 --> 1:48:43.080]  and reform stuff all over the world for women we get all blamed they say normal
[1:48:43.080 --> 1:48:47.000]  sex is rape all men are bad unless you're a jihadi what does that come
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:50.040]  from well you see it's very very important alex for
[1:48:50.040 --> 1:48:54.040]  feminists in the west to focus on things like a man spreading his
[1:48:54.040 --> 1:48:57.080]  legs slightly on the subway or explaining things to women that maybe
[1:48:57.080 --> 1:49:00.520]  they already understand and other kinds of micro aggressions
[1:49:00.520 --> 1:49:05.000]  rather than talk about what could be arguably a genuine rape culture
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:08.680]  that is currently spreading throughout europe and i would argue
[1:49:08.680 --> 1:49:12.680]  made its first real attempt to test the strength and resolve
[1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:16.200]  of europeans and in particular european men throughout germany and other
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:21.000]  countries on new years eve they are testing the resolve there was the
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:24.200]  lara logan incident in egypt a couple of years back where she's
[1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:28.040]  still going into hospital to to deal with medical complications from being
[1:49:28.040 --> 1:49:31.480]  raped and groped by 200 guys who also beat her with flagpoles while she was
[1:49:31.480 --> 1:49:34.440]  covering the arab and the media tried to spend that like
[1:49:34.440 --> 1:49:38.440]  it's all right to rape her you know yeah and now and now there's another
[1:49:38.440 --> 1:49:42.600]  approach where it's okay let's test by the way what type of guy i wouldn't rape
[1:49:42.600 --> 1:49:47.400]  somebody but 200 this is the most sickening demand i mean
[1:49:47.400 --> 1:49:51.560]  i mean if a woman isn't into me it's an instant turn off i just can't even get
[1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:54.840]  rape and then meanwhile a culture that's into it
[1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:57.880]  and then i have two daughters and then i have these feminists telling me i'm bad
[1:49:57.880 --> 1:50:02.840]  because i'm a western man but they love jihadis it's just they're sick
[1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:06.120]  i do not want my daughter growing up in a world where she has to wrap herself in
[1:50:06.120 --> 1:50:10.200]  a beaky pursuit and have a male relative escort her out of the house that is not
[1:50:10.200 --> 1:50:14.200]  what my forefathers bled and fought and died for that's another microaggression
[1:50:14.200 --> 1:50:17.960]  against the muslims buddy well if only i would
[1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:20.920]  didn't have to keep it to microaggressions things might be a little bit
[1:50:20.920 --> 1:50:23.960]  better but this this and this has not really been
[1:50:23.960 --> 1:50:27.800]  called an act of terrorism when in fact it is the whole point is to make sexual
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:30.760]  terrorism nervous about going out that's it
[1:50:30.760 --> 1:50:35.560]  muslims engage in sexual terrorism in europe is that the name of this video
[1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:38.920]  stefan no he's here with his ranting really what it is that that's really
[1:50:38.920 --> 1:50:42.600]  what is going on a terrorism is is changing of people's political
[1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:45.400]  perspectives by acts of aggression and the political
[1:50:45.400 --> 1:50:48.440]  perspectives in in germany are are shifting now

[1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:16.760]  screaming a la auguar and you better believe they'll call for more gun
[1:54:16.760 --> 1:54:19.800]  control because of it because you and i are guilty under
[1:54:19.800 --> 1:54:23.720]  collectivism for one of the jihadis they brought into the country in muslim
[1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:26.920]  dress running around killing a cop that's what's sick
[1:54:26.920 --> 1:54:30.440]  is the weird msnbc kill whitey
[1:54:30.440 --> 1:54:36.520]  race baiting is merging with islam and so is like gangster culture
[1:54:36.520 --> 1:54:40.120]  and it is socially engineered by the fort foundation they admit they're doing
[1:54:40.120 --> 1:54:44.200]  this which shows you really how whacked out they are why would you want to take
[1:54:44.200 --> 1:54:46.440]  syria not attacking us progressive compared to other
[1:54:46.440 --> 1:54:51.320]  countries let jihadists come in kill hundreds of thousands of people mainly
[1:54:51.320 --> 1:54:53.880]  christians blow up all the ancient architecture
[1:54:53.880 --> 1:54:57.640]  and culture blow up the ancient markets
[1:54:57.640 --> 1:55:00.440]  why is our government putting radical islamics in and getting rid of the
[1:55:00.440 --> 1:55:03.960]  guys in suits and ties where women can go to college and be free
[1:55:03.960 --> 1:55:07.880]  i mean it's true sonam's not perfect but compared to al-qaeda he's a good guy
[1:55:07.880 --> 1:55:12.440]  Assad's a lot better than asad than asad qaddafi works for the west opens up
[1:55:12.440 --> 1:55:15.320]  women go to college they don't have to wear hoods on their heads black people
[1:55:15.320 --> 1:55:18.120]  are treated like first-class citizens they kill him
[1:55:18.120 --> 1:55:21.480]  i mean it really does just show power mad evil
[1:55:21.480 --> 1:55:25.880]  to ally with the dominant islamic force will hobbyism out of saudi arabia
[1:55:25.880 --> 1:55:29.000]  stefan malinu and ask if you agree with that statement and be
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:32.760]  where you think this grand chess board is going because
[1:55:32.760 --> 1:55:36.600]  uh i don't think they're going to be able to suspend reality have their jihadis
[1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:40.040]  keep attacking and then blaming on gun owners of the general public
[1:55:40.040 --> 1:55:43.800]  and have civil emergency i think the political class is going to be punished
[1:55:43.800 --> 1:55:47.000]  for what they're doing i think the left the political correctness
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:50.840]  has gone too far well i think it's important to remember
[1:55:50.840 --> 1:55:54.520]  that stability in the middle east is just another government program world
[1:55:54.520 --> 1:55:58.200]  peace as they claim to deliver is just another government program and will do
[1:55:58.200 --> 1:56:02.120]  about as well as the welfare state and the war on drugs and you name it
[1:56:02.120 --> 1:56:05.320]  so the fact is of course that they were supposed to bring peace and stability
[1:56:05.320 --> 1:56:08.760]  and democracy to the middle east and what has happened well the middle east is
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:12.440]  in flames so not only has that program done the exact
[1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:15.800]  opposite of what it was claimed just like obama care did in terms of making
[1:56:15.800 --> 1:56:19.320]  health care affordable but it is not only
[1:56:19.320 --> 1:56:22.600]  destabilized the middle east but it is wildly in the process
[1:56:22.600 --> 1:56:27.560]  of destroying europe and this is what happens when people put their faith
[1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:31.240]  in the modern devil called the interventionist state
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:34.840]  my godafi said in 2010 you better have a plan
[1:56:34.840 --> 1:56:38.920]  because if you get rid of the dictators in the middle east
[1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:43.000]  you will get massive floods of migrants into europe we are the ones holding
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:47.240]  them back and next thing you know hillary clinton is like yay we killed him
[1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:52.440]  here comes liberty with a smell i killed people for no reason i'm tough
[1:56:52.440 --> 1:56:55.960]  yeah so this is really the big picture thing is important to understand this
[1:56:55.960 --> 1:56:58.760]  didn't come out of nowhere this came out of people's faith
[1:56:58.760 --> 1:57:03.720]  in the state to provide something as historically unattainable and complex
[1:57:03.720 --> 1:57:07.080]  as peace and stability in the middle east which is a fairly superstitious and
[1:57:07.080 --> 1:57:11.240]  volatile region at the best of times they can't even reduce the murder rate in
[1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:14.760]  washington let alone bring peace to some foreign culture
[1:57:14.760 --> 1:57:18.440]  that they don't even speak the language of thousands of miles away so
[1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:22.120]  the the reason why european civilization is crumbling in an ever
[1:57:22.120 --> 1:57:24.840]  accelerating fashion is because people continue
[1:57:24.840 --> 1:57:28.920]  to put their faith in the modern god of the state
[1:57:28.920 --> 1:57:32.360]  which is in fact a devil in all of its consequences
[1:57:32.360 --> 1:57:36.440]  no kidding and but but see we say the state's incompetent the globalist
[1:57:36.440 --> 1:57:39.000]  corporation's making money off servicing the state
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:42.040]  and the calamities admit they want to crisis economy
[1:57:42.040 --> 1:57:45.240]  and they knew they were destabilizing they knew it would fall into europe
[1:57:45.240 --> 1:57:47.720]  they opened the borders with peter southerland in the eu
[1:57:47.720 --> 1:57:51.640]  they said to end the homogeneity and bring balkanization i mean they write
[1:57:51.640 --> 1:57:54.680]  articles admitting their plan they're actually pretty competent
[1:57:54.680 --> 1:57:58.280]  well and i would argue that it's impossible to understand world events
[1:57:58.280 --> 1:58:02.840]  right now without understanding that we are in the end days of fiat currency
[1:58:02.840 --> 1:58:07.880]  the the long stretched out monopoly money fantasy castle is about to be blown
[1:58:07.880 --> 1:58:10.600]  down by the insistent winds of economic reality
[1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:13.160]  there is simply no way to understand world events
[1:58:13.160 --> 1:58:16.680]  the welfare state is the fundamental problem i'm all for free
[1:58:16.680 --> 1:58:19.960]  a border movement as long as people have the right to not associate with others
[1:58:19.960 --> 1:58:23.000]  and the welfare state and not to pay the hordes of people coming in back in
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:25.800]  sixty six give you the four or five minutes to finish up with this
[1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:28.920]  folks it is an implosion plan but you can say well they're incompetent or they
[1:58:28.920 --> 1:58:31.320]  competent well no they're confident burning the
[1:58:31.320 --> 1:58:34.440]  house down and collecting the insurance money and that's what the world leader
[1:58:34.440 --> 1:58:37.160]  doing creating crises posing as saviors
[1:58:37.160 --> 1:58:40.120]  grabbing more power as civilization falls apart

[2:00:02.200 --> 2:00:09.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:12.920 --> 2:00:18.840]  you know what's weird uh a healthy powerful woman was a really cool man
[2:00:18.840 --> 2:00:23.240]  that they augment each other they love each other they back each other up
[2:00:23.240 --> 2:00:27.240]  but they like a dominant strong man who knows what he's doing
[2:00:27.240 --> 2:00:30.680]  and who can sweep her off her feet it's not that she's weak she just wants
[2:00:30.680 --> 2:00:34.440]  a really good man that's genetic and all mammals all species
[2:00:34.440 --> 2:00:38.440]  but these leftists that have destroyed men in general
[2:00:38.440 --> 2:00:41.560]  i mean they've done a good job i was i mean they're like walking they act like
[2:00:41.560 --> 2:00:44.920]  they're tough not really men are these little weirdos
[2:00:44.920 --> 2:00:48.200]  then they're so desperate a lot of them actually going out and getting a muslim
[2:00:48.200 --> 2:00:51.240]  a guy or whatever they'll slap him around knock their teeth out which is not
[2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:53.720]  what a good woman should want but but then they go to the really
[2:00:53.720 --> 2:00:57.800]  bizarre extreme of it to a guy that doesn't work sits on the couch and
[2:00:57.800 --> 2:01:00.600]  tells her get in there in the kitchen make me money and get out on the street
[2:01:00.600 --> 2:01:05.800]  and turn some tricks and uh they just seem to like it
[2:01:05.800 --> 2:01:09.480]  so gone are the guys open the door for you they like being backhanded and getting
[2:01:09.480 --> 2:01:12.760]  that nose broken and i'm not kidding they want to be cuckold they want to be
[2:01:12.760 --> 2:01:15.080]  crushed i think there's a sick mental illness to all
[2:01:15.080 --> 2:01:18.360]  this stuff i'm all new your take on that and other closing points i want to get
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:21.480]  you back more often my friend oh thanks it's a great pleasure to be
[2:01:21.480 --> 2:01:25.320]  back on the show and um people were saying you know a lot
[2:01:25.320 --> 2:01:28.280]  in the sort of the comments and the emails and messages that i received
[2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:32.600]  saying about these these cologne and and other city attacks on the women
[2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:36.200]  in germany they were saying where are the german men and of course they're not
[2:01:36.200 --> 2:01:39.240]  talking about the you know the mustachioed foot stomping march across
[2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:42.040]  europe german men just the men who would rush to the defense
[2:01:42.040 --> 2:01:45.160]  of victimized women around police wouldn't even help
[2:01:45.160 --> 2:01:49.560]  police wouldn't help but here's the thing alex i think that um
[2:01:49.560 --> 2:01:53.800]  it has been so ingrained in western men that in any confrontation between a
[2:01:53.800 --> 2:01:57.080]  white man and a minority the facts don't matter the white
[2:01:57.080 --> 2:02:00.680]  man's life will be destroyed look at the george zimmerman
[2:02:00.680 --> 2:02:04.600]  or darin wilson or other people the facts don't matter your life will be
[2:02:04.600 --> 2:02:07.720]  destroyed you know that used to be this old saying when it came to self defense
[2:02:07.720 --> 2:02:11.480]  it's better to be tried by 12 than carried by six that's right
[2:02:11.480 --> 2:02:14.680]  i'm not sure that that's true anymore i think people are saying
[2:02:14.680 --> 2:02:18.280]  i will take anything because the media is going to side with the minority no
[2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:21.400]  matter what the facts are my life is going to be destroyed
[2:02:21.400 --> 2:02:25.160]  even if i'm vindicated in a court of law my life is going to be destroyed my
[2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:28.120]  family my career my income is going to be destroyed
[2:02:28.120 --> 2:02:30.840]  and so there's there's been this fantastic media
[2:02:30.840 --> 2:02:35.720]  hold them down of of white males to the point where self defense has become an
[2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:39.640]  impractical art of social and economic suicide
[2:02:39.640 --> 2:02:43.560]  i agree we are being domesticated i mean everybody is basically but
[2:02:43.560 --> 2:02:46.040]  then they bring in a third world population that we're shooting laws
[2:02:46.040 --> 2:02:48.760]  rockets rpgs and each other a month before
[2:02:48.760 --> 2:02:52.360]  and raping and beheading women and sex slaving i mean
[2:02:52.360 --> 2:02:56.040]  what is the left thing's going to happen this is going to be explosive
[2:02:56.040 --> 2:03:00.760]  well the fact that the left is allied with a very primitive
[2:03:00.760 --> 2:03:05.080]  medieval and medieval is even a complement pre-medieval sharia type
[2:03:05.080 --> 2:03:07.960]  um enemy the fact that the left is allied with them
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:11.720]  is very revealing it's not revealing to the left who again i simply just powered
[2:03:11.720 --> 2:03:14.520]  junkies looking for their next fix but it's revealing
[2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:19.240]  to everyone else like the fact that the left says to donald trump
[2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:23.400]  mr trump it's terrible that you show up in an isis recruitment video
[2:03:23.400 --> 2:03:28.440]  well if the west is at war with isis as they or as we claim you should show up
[2:03:28.440 --> 2:03:32.360]  that's a good thing you know church ill do you know you're showing up in nazi
[2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:35.400]  propaganda it's like well that's the point of being at war
[2:03:35.400 --> 2:03:39.320]  i'm in their videos so is your bigs we're in isis videos
[2:03:39.320 --> 2:03:43.400]  i'm i haven't shown up in an isis video soon i'm incredibly disappointed with
[2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:47.240]  my performance it's terrible that's your that's the point of fighting as you're
[2:03:47.240 --> 2:03:50.120]  supposed to annoy the people you're fighting at the very least
[2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:53.160]  well you're doing a great job and i want to invite you at least once a month on
[2:03:53.160 --> 2:03:55.800]  this show and on the nightly news because really
[2:03:55.800 --> 2:03:58.920]  you're one of the smartest guys in the room when it comes to boiling it down
[2:03:58.920 --> 2:04:02.600]  you're dead on but really this is so nakedly black and white
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:06.200]  most things historically aren't really black and white what the crazy power
[2:04:06.200 --> 2:04:09.880]  grabbers are doing really is black and white insanity
[2:04:09.880 --> 2:04:12.920]  thanks alex it was a real pleasure we'll talk to you again free domain radio
[2:04:12.920 --> 2:04:17.960]  dot com twitter stephan malinu m-o-l-y-n-e-u-x
[2:04:17.960 --> 2:04:21.720]  youtube free domain radio uh just a great guy and reaching hundreds of
[2:04:21.720 --> 2:04:26.200]  millions of people and i tell you it it feels good at night
[2:04:26.200 --> 2:04:29.880]  to know there are so many people out there and you know stephan
[2:04:29.880 --> 2:04:33.080]  uh is an atheist basically i think i can say that and and you know he's a smart
[2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:36.920]  guy i respect him he's a cool guy you know who actually has his views and
[2:04:36.920 --> 2:04:40.120]  back him up he's not one of these leftist atheists that wants to you know
[2:04:40.120 --> 2:04:44.360]  says i'm an evil you know right winger and wants my guns uh and so he reaches
[2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:47.080]  out to a lot of people on the left that wouldn't listen to me that's great
[2:04:47.080 --> 2:04:50.120]  that's what it's all about folks different strokes for different folks
[2:04:50.120 --> 2:04:53.960]  but all together promoting freedom open debate that's what a diverse
[2:04:53.960 --> 2:04:58.920]  civilization is not political correctness and sharia law
[2:04:58.920 --> 2:05:03.240]  joe bigs here with info wars dot com overflow crowd for donald trump and
[2:05:03.240 --> 2:05:06.520]  bernie sanders backyard article up by the new york times
[2:05:06.520 --> 2:05:10.680]  donald j trump touchdown in one of america's most progressive cities
[2:05:10.680 --> 2:05:15.320]  thursday night bringing the bombastic message that has captivated republican

[2:05:21.080 --> 2:05:25.080]  of vermont this visit came as a billionaire real estate mogul has made a
[2:05:25.080 --> 2:05:29.320]  point of broadening his focus beyond the early primary states
[2:05:29.320 --> 2:05:32.760]  showcasing his popularity with packed rallies from mississippi to
[2:05:32.760 --> 2:05:37.080]  massachusetts and now vermont a one-time republican bastion that
[2:05:37.080 --> 2:05:41.720]  is now one of the most solid liberal states in the nation the choice of
[2:05:41.720 --> 2:05:45.080]  venues seem curious to some but thursday's rallies serve multiple
[2:05:45.080 --> 2:05:48.600]  purposes for the trump campaign needling mr sanders in his own
[2:05:48.600 --> 2:05:52.360]  neighborhood garnering attention in nearby new hampshire which holds the

[2:08:05.640 --> 2:08:16.680]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:08:16.680 --> 2:08:20.040]  earlier in the last hour i played a compilation of
[2:08:20.040 --> 2:08:24.520]  eight different clips of president obama as a candidate
[2:08:24.520 --> 2:08:29.240]  and early on in his administration six years ago
[2:08:29.240 --> 2:08:32.840]  saying that a president with executive orders on law
[2:08:32.840 --> 2:08:37.160]  is tyranny and he's a constitutional lawyer so he knows that well he said
[2:08:37.160 --> 2:08:40.440]  earlier this week at the white house in a press conference that
[2:08:40.440 --> 2:08:43.960]  congress won't act and get in line that's a quote
[2:08:43.960 --> 2:08:49.000]  so he's going to act it's advisory but
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:53.240]  magically some algorithm for a no-fly list this extra judicial extra
[2:08:53.240 --> 2:08:57.160]  legislative they just put you on it and you can't own a gun
[2:08:57.160 --> 2:09:00.120]  and they're going to go after gun manufacturers and they're going to tell
[2:09:00.120 --> 2:09:03.000]  your doctor to spy on you and they're going to do
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:06.120]  so many other things in an executive power grab
[2:09:06.120 --> 2:09:10.040]  that on its face is unprecedented more executive orders in the last six
[2:09:10.040 --> 2:09:13.480]  presidents where is the move to impeach him i had
[2:09:13.480 --> 2:09:16.680]  donald trump on here and he said well it was just making kind of a victim he's
[2:09:16.680 --> 2:09:21.640]  only got 11 months left in office we don't have 11 months to wait
[2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:25.080]  he was on cnn last night saying i'll be gone soon don't worry about this gun
[2:09:25.080 --> 2:09:27.960]  stuff they're having the agency start all this up
[2:09:27.960 --> 2:09:31.000]  and the republican leadership the same ones that gave us obama care
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:34.840]  you name it they're going to let it stand
[2:09:35.480 --> 2:09:39.160]  sheriff mac got the brady bill overturned they just did instant check
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:43.880]  which was outside of law and then they just keep expanding that
[2:09:43.880 --> 2:09:46.920]  just like he's done with open borders just like he won't tell governors where
[2:09:46.920 --> 2:09:51.720]  the refugees are being taken they're just turned loose it's all illegal
[2:09:51.720 --> 2:09:55.080]  so there's a bunch of reasons to impeach him we had an article yesterday
[2:09:55.080 --> 2:10:00.040]  75 crimes from barack obama but there was an article went viral that
[2:10:00.040 --> 2:10:03.880]  steve watson wrote on monday report rnc will consider
[2:10:03.880 --> 2:10:07.800]  obama impeachment proceedings 48 criminal charges
[2:10:07.800 --> 2:10:11.160]  and we have the north american law center
[2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:14.600]  on with us i've called congress i've confirmed they are looking at this they
[2:10:14.600 --> 2:10:19.320]  are circulating it other draft resolutions are circulating
[2:10:19.320 --> 2:10:24.280]  steven pigeon is a political scientist phd and a lawyer
[2:10:24.280 --> 2:10:27.800]  and he is spearheading this operation of the north american law center dot
[2:10:27.800 --> 2:10:32.600]  or g and we are here beating the drum now he's been on
[2:10:32.600 --> 2:10:36.760]  national television as well saying look we've got to go ahead and start this
[2:10:36.760 --> 2:10:40.840]  it's it's our duty we can't just say well strategically we want to let
[2:10:40.840 --> 2:10:43.960]  the president you know barbecued children on the white house lawn
[2:10:43.960 --> 2:10:47.400]  we start aiding and abetting those crimes
[2:10:47.400 --> 2:10:51.960]  okay so that's my view he is a political scientist and a lawyer
[2:10:51.960 --> 2:10:55.720]  and uh he's been battling and challenging obama's lawlessness
[2:10:55.720 --> 2:10:59.400]  but remember this will pass on to the republicans as well this is precedent
[2:10:59.400 --> 2:11:03.560]  shedding we have to push back in my view and at least have the hearings
[2:11:03.560 --> 2:11:09.000]  look how many of his agency heads have had to resign and are on the verge of
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:13.560]  criminal charges hillary is within millimeters of being indicted that's
[2:11:13.560 --> 2:11:17.400]  mainstream news right now her emails lying to congress it's all coming out
[2:11:17.400 --> 2:11:21.800]  we either get on the offensive folks or they're going to take it as a big
[2:11:21.800 --> 2:11:26.520]  fat green light to run us over this is a critical decision right now
[2:11:26.520 --> 2:11:29.160]  probably one of the most important in our country's history and you know i don't
[2:11:29.160 --> 2:11:32.840]  usually talk like that i can hardly sleep at night i usually
[2:11:32.840 --> 2:11:36.120]  sleep like the dead could have been like 30 seconds
[2:11:36.120 --> 2:11:38.600]  i've quit drinking coffee in the afternoons i'm having trouble going to
[2:11:38.600 --> 2:11:43.080]  sleep the last week because i can just feel the momentousness i had a big
[2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:48.520]  guest on last hour said the same thing everybody can feel it not just see it
[2:11:48.520 --> 2:11:52.920]  the evil is on the move folks the good news is good is on the move as well
[2:11:52.920 --> 2:11:56.520]  in liberal socialist brain dead bernie sanders districts
[2:11:56.520 --> 2:12:00.200]  prompts got 40 50 000 people i mean this is unprecedented
[2:12:00.200 --> 2:12:03.720]  so joining us is steven pigeon north american law center dot org sir
[2:12:03.720 --> 2:12:07.160]  you're the constitutional loyal political scientist but that you know my
[2:12:07.160 --> 2:12:11.080]  point is am i right we have a responsibility i mean the law isn't
[2:12:11.080 --> 2:12:15.080]  something we just enforce when we feel like it sir is that correct
[2:12:15.080 --> 2:12:18.920]  that's correct alex and in fact what you're saying is extremely important
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:23.320]  we've reached a threshold point now where mr obama is poised to
[2:12:23.320 --> 2:12:26.360]  completely overthrow the constitutional republic
[2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:30.760]  with a continuous stream of executive orders which exceed
[2:12:30.760 --> 2:12:34.840]  the power of the presidency and usurp the authority of congress
[2:12:34.840 --> 2:12:37.800]  he's doing it through the expansion of bureaucracies
[2:12:37.800 --> 2:12:42.840]  and demanding congress fall in line with his ultra virus acts to the
[2:12:42.840 --> 2:12:46.280]  constitution this light the latest play with gun
[2:12:46.280 --> 2:12:50.040]  control is particularly onerous and he's using
[2:12:50.040 --> 2:12:53.960]  the socialist tax plan called obama care
[2:12:53.960 --> 2:12:58.120]  to implement what really are policies that were originated
[2:12:58.120 --> 2:13:01.080]  in the third rike you know the obama care
[2:13:01.080 --> 2:13:07.560]  strikes chords of doctrines that were criminalized under the 1947
[2:13:07.560 --> 2:13:12.360]  nürnberg act when doctors were executed from the nazi regime
[2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:15.800]  for proposing just exactly what's on the table with obama care
[2:13:15.800 --> 2:13:20.600]  and he's using the same playbook to say well doctors can determine whether
[2:13:20.600 --> 2:13:24.280]  or not you're a health care threat if you're a social security recipient you
[2:13:24.280 --> 2:13:29.080]  have no right to own a firearm so on and so forth all in a guise to
[2:13:29.080 --> 2:13:34.040]  completely disarm the american public while he imports hundreds of thousands
[2:13:34.040 --> 2:13:38.200]  of muslim terrorists and other paid mercenaries
[2:13:38.200 --> 2:13:42.440]  who come into the country unarmed to find mosques that are essentially
[2:13:42.440 --> 2:13:46.920]  armories and what you're saying is borne
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:50.280]  out by the facts it sounds sensational but for those that don't know it's the
[2:13:50.280 --> 2:13:53.960]  plotting obama care and open power grab over the whole infrastructure
[2:13:53.960 --> 2:13:57.640]  one seventh of the economy blank check uh the funding
[2:13:57.640 --> 2:14:02.600]  the the the ups planes funded by the feds flying in
[2:14:02.600 --> 2:14:06.840]  disappearing jfk airport says we're told just let them in and just release them
[2:14:06.840 --> 2:14:11.080]  we don't even look at their ids i mean meanwhile the tsa grubs 10-year-old
[2:14:11.080 --> 2:14:13.880]  girls this is an unprecedented takeover and
[2:14:13.880 --> 2:14:18.680]  walking through this sir you'll flesh out what you're saying here about
[2:14:18.680 --> 2:14:21.400]  this appearing to be a planned takeover because i agree
[2:14:21.400 --> 2:14:24.360]  this doesn't just look like a soft takeover anymore
[2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:28.600]  it looks like there could be even more draconian stuff planned
[2:14:28.600 --> 2:14:31.960]  it's not it's not a soft takeover anymore and this is where we have arrived
[2:14:31.960 --> 2:14:36.120]  i mean all of this business of allowing criminal activity on the part of mr
[2:14:36.120 --> 2:14:41.000]  obama over the last six years including his usurpation of the office
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:45.720]  his failure to establish his own identity his identity fraud actionable
[2:14:45.720 --> 2:14:50.120]  identity fraud uh the crimes he's committed uh in terms of
[2:14:50.120 --> 2:14:53.880]  rules of engagement in the field deploying american troops
[2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:58.440]  spending money american tax dollars to further the benefit of hezbollah
[2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:05.400]  hamas the palestinian liberation army uh islamic jihad his own funding training
[2:15:05.400 --> 2:15:09.000]  and deployment of ices all of these are well-established facts
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:12.200]  gosh and butchers by a great deal of evidence and
[2:15:12.200 --> 2:15:16.600]  all amount to egregious breaches of his trust
[2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:21.080]  as the president of the united states and they're all impeachable offenses
[2:15:21.080 --> 2:15:24.440]  and so either the country acts to restore the rule of law
[2:15:24.440 --> 2:15:29.880]  and impeach this gentleman for the crimes he's committed against this country
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:34.200]  or we lose the constitutional republic i mean it really has gotten
[2:15:34.200 --> 2:15:39.160]  to that point well he wears a lojavius ring
[2:15:39.160 --> 2:15:43.960]  he has family that have overthrown countries in the middle east he's been
[2:15:43.960 --> 2:15:47.320]  caught financing the muslim brotherhood i thought they were just manipulating
[2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:50.360]  the arrows and using to take over the middle east the more radical groups
[2:15:50.360 --> 2:15:54.360]  but when you really get down to it i've talked to a lot of senior people in the
[2:15:54.360 --> 2:15:57.560]  government and and folks at high level in government that have talked to others
[2:15:57.560 --> 2:16:02.360]  and i've confirmed it over two years with high level folks and i've got
[2:16:02.360 --> 2:16:05.080]  bonjino calling me up going i didn't tell you that i said on there no it wasn't
[2:16:05.080 --> 2:16:07.800]  bonjino he said it's worse than i know but never told me anything
[2:16:07.800 --> 2:16:10.840]  secret the head of obama's foreign details and then he quit
[2:16:10.840 --> 2:16:14.280]  saying it's worse than you know i have got it and i've gotten some threats over
[2:16:14.280 --> 2:16:16.440]  this because it's it's it they know it's true
[2:16:16.440 --> 2:16:22.360]  obama is a practicing wahhabist he actually prays every five times a day
[2:16:22.360 --> 2:16:25.160]  and i didn't believe this back when i heard it five years ago but this is from
[2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:28.680]  high level people they are scared of him i mean they
[2:16:28.680 --> 2:16:31.480]  i mean i guess that's why congress won't do anything is
[2:16:31.480 --> 2:16:35.000]  he's backed by george soros this crazy nazi collaborator
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:38.200]  i can't believe we're in this much trouble and the left is supporting it
[2:16:38.200 --> 2:16:42.200]  and merkel says basically let quote criminals come in that's a quote
[2:16:42.200 --> 2:16:45.560]  and the feminist mayor says let them you know you know it's your fault women
[2:16:45.560 --> 2:16:49.560]  that you're raped i mean i guess the left really is taking over in his ally with
[2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:53.000]  radical islam well it's not just the left alex this is
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:56.280]  what our problem is here today we've had a great deal of stone walling
[2:16:56.280 --> 2:16:59.800]  coming from the upper leadership also of the republican party
[2:16:59.800 --> 2:17:04.920]  and there really is no excuse for it you know recently 163 democrat legislators
[2:17:04.920 --> 2:17:07.400]  signed on a bill that will essentially get
[2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:11.640]  the bill of rights entirely based upon this gun control rhetoric
[2:17:11.640 --> 2:17:14.680]  so we're we're at a point where you know it's gun control the day and in
[2:17:14.680 --> 2:17:18.760]  tournament camps tomorrow the reality is that when you when
[2:17:18.760 --> 2:17:22.600]  you're discussing mr obama he has committed a series of crimes
[2:17:22.600 --> 2:17:26.120]  that are ongoing and the crimes have not stopped
[2:17:26.120 --> 2:17:30.840]  we had to stop at 48 articles because we just simply couldn't gather together
[2:17:30.840 --> 2:17:33.720]  more of the treasonous acts that he's committed for instance
[2:17:33.720 --> 2:17:37.560]  trading mr burgdoll from five al-qaeda leaders that were immediately deployed
[2:17:37.560 --> 2:17:41.720]  into the field also spying on congress an article that appears
[2:17:41.720 --> 2:17:44.520]  to have gone away spying on congress and foreign leaders
[2:17:44.520 --> 2:17:48.760]  without a deprobable cause we're under a search in seizure environment
[2:17:48.760 --> 2:17:51.800]  with cameras deployed everywhere and nsa downloads
[2:17:51.800 --> 2:17:55.960]  etc all of these things violate the constitution and we've sat back and
[2:17:55.960 --> 2:18:00.760]  taken it for six years now when you have a president who has usurped
[2:18:00.760 --> 2:18:04.840]  congressional authority and congress allows it to happen
[2:18:04.840 --> 2:18:08.280]  we don't have months we don't even have weeks
[2:18:08.280 --> 2:18:11.480]  this man could start world war three tomorrow
[2:18:11.480 --> 2:18:14.760]  and he could buy an act martial law at the
[2:18:14.760 --> 2:18:18.520]  twilling of a pen these things become critically important
[2:18:18.520 --> 2:18:23.000]  there has been some people with integrity inside the republican national
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:27.560]  committee namely david ajima who has brought forth the resolution to the rnc
[2:18:27.560 --> 2:18:31.240]  and said consider these articles have been peaceful that was my next question sir
[2:18:31.240 --> 2:18:34.120]  how much support do we have thank god you're in there getting this done
[2:18:34.120 --> 2:18:37.000]  i can't believe we aren't hearing from more congressmen and women for
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:40.040]  themselves calling for it when they have in the past this is so
[2:18:40.040 --> 2:18:44.360]  egregious let's walk through that in a moment because this is so important but
[2:18:44.360 --> 2:18:48.200]  let me first since you mentioned martial law back you up this
[2:18:48.200 --> 2:18:52.920]  article needs to go mega viral report rnc will consider obama
[2:18:52.920 --> 2:18:57.640]  impeachment proceedings it's up on info wars dot com but let's continue
[2:18:57.640 --> 2:19:03.880]  we have another story where on cnn they are calling for obama to declare quote
[2:19:03.880 --> 2:19:08.520]  a national state of emergency and just confiscate the guns the daily beast
[2:19:08.520 --> 2:19:12.120]  and other white house connecting groups have also in the last month just said
[2:19:12.120 --> 2:19:15.480]  you know what we do want to take them just take them they've got to know
[2:19:15.480 --> 2:19:20.280]  that's going to start a civil war if this begins i mean so is that really their
[2:19:20.280 --> 2:19:24.040]  plan and then i want to get back into how we get impeachment going because
[2:19:24.040 --> 2:19:27.000]  obviously even if we don't get impeachment which we should
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:31.560]  it'll give us a bully pulpit to bring out all their crimes go ahead sir
[2:19:31.560 --> 2:19:35.640]  that's exactly right alex the bully pulpit is a big part of it but we are
[2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:40.600]  seeking impeachment not just the pulpit and we have been working with a
[2:19:40.600 --> 2:19:44.040]  number of legislators so one of the later that has come out
[2:19:44.040 --> 2:19:47.400]  with really good voice here in the last couple of days is of course representative
[2:19:47.400 --> 2:19:50.600]  don young from the state of alaska who is
[2:19:50.600 --> 2:19:54.120]  critically concerned about this deprivation of second amendment rights
[2:19:54.120 --> 2:19:58.040]  there are other republican conservatives in congress
[2:19:58.040 --> 2:20:04.680]  who are also supporting the bill however what is required is a it's a
[2:20:04.680 --> 2:20:08.280]  grass fire that must take place and of course the grass fire begins with the
[2:20:08.280 --> 2:20:11.720]  first child who says hey the emperor has no clothes
[2:20:11.720 --> 2:20:15.720]  the reality is is that this fire has been lit there has been a match struck to
[2:20:15.720 --> 2:20:19.240]  the dry to the dry hay i believe that there is somewhere between
[2:20:19.240 --> 2:20:22.360]  75 and 85 percent of the people in this country that would
[2:20:22.360 --> 2:20:26.840]  support impeachment and that number will grow when you begin to see that this
[2:20:26.840 --> 2:20:30.520]  of this out i agree the cnn polls you know that 60
[2:20:30.520 --> 2:20:34.600]  percent support guys more like 20 30 percent obama's got below 30 numbers
[2:20:34.600 --> 2:20:38.120]  even with his idiot constituents i mean liberals are coming out in support of
[2:20:38.120 --> 2:20:41.400]  trump and drose that's correct and of course
[2:20:41.400 --> 2:20:45.000]  even the people that are supporting obama don't know the entire truth
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:47.880]  if they knew the entire truth of what took place in libya
[2:20:47.880 --> 2:20:51.720]  and the transfer of 200 000 tons of arms into the hands of ices
[2:20:51.720 --> 2:20:55.720]  the creation of ices by obama and hillary the deployment of ices and all
[2:20:55.720 --> 2:20:59.560]  of those crimes that you see ices commit the beheading of christians
[2:20:59.560 --> 2:21:02.440]  the sale of eight-year-old girls into sex slavery
[2:21:02.440 --> 2:21:06.360]  the trafficking of human beings the burning of villages etc the burning of
[2:21:06.360 --> 2:21:09.240]  a pilot alive all of those crimes are on the
[2:21:09.240 --> 2:21:13.400]  are on the desk of mr obama who created and funded and deployed this group
[2:21:13.400 --> 2:21:16.680]  and continues to fund and arm them and support them
[2:21:16.680 --> 2:21:20.760]  that my friend is an act of treason we've got to do it
[2:21:20.760 --> 2:21:25.400]  and and what do we do to put pressure on poll ryan and others
[2:21:25.400 --> 2:21:29.080]  who keeps saying oh he's politically you know dead right now
[2:21:29.080 --> 2:21:32.520]  we're going to win a landslide that's not true he could start a war with russia
[2:21:32.520 --> 2:21:36.360]  anybody they're clearly lining up and behaving like
[2:21:36.360 --> 2:21:39.960]  they may go for broke and flooding us with the forces
[2:21:39.960 --> 2:21:43.880]  to create terror attacks then obama declares a state of emergency
[2:21:43.880 --> 2:21:47.320]  to respond to the jihadis he himself is brought in
[2:21:47.320 --> 2:21:51.000]  i mean europe's declared civil emergencies using the jihadis they brought
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:54.120]  in banning arresting libertarian leaders like
[2:21:54.120 --> 2:21:57.240]  lapin who's number one in the presidential polls
[2:21:57.240 --> 2:22:00.680]  what they've done in europe i think the blueprint for here
[2:22:00.680 --> 2:22:03.960]  i think that's exactly right except the model is even more draconian than
[2:22:03.960 --> 2:22:08.200]  that we will not get to a 2016 election if mr obama has
[2:22:08.200 --> 2:22:11.880]  his way and if he's given free reign to do whatever he
[2:22:11.880 --> 2:22:14.920]  will between now and then we will not make it
[2:22:14.920 --> 2:22:18.280]  his intentions are of course the overthrow of the constitutional republic
[2:22:18.280 --> 2:22:21.000]  of the united states he's in breach of his office
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:24.920]  you can't have super numerous acts of treason and call it anything
[2:22:24.920 --> 2:22:28.120]  other than in an intentional overthrow of the country
[2:22:28.120 --> 2:22:31.960]  that's what's going on here and he's being aided and abetted
[2:22:31.960 --> 2:22:35.880]  by people in congress who have full knowledge of these facts and who will do
[2:22:35.880 --> 2:22:39.080]  nothing now there is a federal statute that
[2:22:39.080 --> 2:22:42.920]  reiterates what's in the constitution as to what constitutes treason
[2:22:42.920 --> 2:22:47.480]  and second to that statute is another statute called misprision of treason
[2:22:47.480 --> 2:22:50.280]  those who are aware of the treason that is being committed
[2:22:50.280 --> 2:22:54.520]  are guilty of the crime of treason as much as the person who has committed to
[2:22:54.520 --> 2:22:58.600]  treason if they take no steps to report it and to act against it that's what i
[2:22:58.600 --> 2:23:01.800]  said earlier they know the congressman know
[2:23:01.800 --> 2:23:05.560]  there are some that are prepared to act but they need the support of the people
[2:23:05.560 --> 2:23:09.720]  now the beauty of it is that the rnc is going to come forward with this
[2:23:09.720 --> 2:23:12.680]  resolution it's it's trying to be blocked by your
[2:23:12.680 --> 2:23:14.840]  ranks please give us the details we're going to write a big
[2:23:14.840 --> 2:23:17.960]  article sir again mr pigeon heads up north american legal
[2:23:17.960 --> 2:23:21.880]  center dot org very uh you know a prestigious organization doing a great
[2:23:21.880 --> 2:23:25.640]  job you have got congress people on osama mar behind the scenes
[2:23:25.640 --> 2:23:27.960]  it's like going up against emperor palpatine but they're doing and are
[2:23:27.960 --> 2:23:31.400]  going up against hitler they are ready to move with this give us the details
[2:23:31.400 --> 2:23:35.240]  and how we support it well the best way to support this is one you
[2:23:35.240 --> 2:23:38.680]  have to contact your rnc delegate that's the first
[2:23:38.680 --> 2:23:41.880]  step and you need to make it clear to the rnc delegate
[2:23:41.880 --> 2:23:45.800]  that you're not going to tolerate dictatorial policies
[2:23:45.800 --> 2:23:50.600]  from some new world order elite telling the rnc what they're going to do
[2:23:50.600 --> 2:23:54.840]  the rnc for all intents and purposes has been overthrown by corporate elitists
[2:23:54.840 --> 2:23:58.440]  does not represent the cup the republican or the conservative base
[2:23:58.440 --> 2:24:01.800]  the republicans have long held planks that support marriage
[2:24:01.800 --> 2:24:06.040]  and that does support the traditional family and also our our pro-life
[2:24:06.040 --> 2:24:09.880]  and you know one of the smaller government reduced taxes all the
[2:24:09.880 --> 2:24:15.000]  typical conservative republican planks the rnc has holds those planks and they
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:19.880]  operate in direct contravention to their own order
[2:24:19.880 --> 2:24:23.880]  and they're doing that because they are being controlled by outside forces
[2:24:23.880 --> 2:24:28.520]  and the rnc is being dictated to through the likes of ranks previs
[2:24:28.520 --> 2:24:34.040]  who is working diligently to make sure that mr obama is able to move through
[2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:38.200]  with his game plan entirely and with no opposition
[2:24:38.200 --> 2:24:41.880]  from the republicans they're covering his entire flank so getting into
[2:24:41.880 --> 2:24:45.240]  how the resolution comes forward what we do give us the specifics of the
[2:24:45.240 --> 2:24:48.440]  resolution so we can write an article about it link to your stuff
[2:24:48.440 --> 2:24:52.040]  and really get people pushing it the articles of impeachment have been
[2:24:52.040 --> 2:24:55.480]  online at north america law center for sometimes there's 48 articles under
[2:24:55.480 --> 2:24:59.320]  three headings and that is the resolution that is before
[2:24:59.320 --> 2:25:02.840]  the rnc the republican national committee contact your committee member
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:05.800]  in addition it is critical that you contact your
[2:25:05.800 --> 2:25:09.000]  representative in the house of representatives because what takes
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:12.760]  place is some representative any one representative
[2:25:12.760 --> 2:25:16.280]  can enter the articles of impeachment in the judiciary committee
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:20.760]  and call for that as impeachment articles to move forward like bob martin
[2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:25.000]  that's correct and with the support of the people calling the judiciary committee
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:27.880]  members of the judiciary committee and calling the representatives
[2:25:27.880 --> 2:25:31.560]  and demanding impeachment you know the choices are we either move forward with
[2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:34.520]  the rule of law or we are going to be resorting to
[2:25:34.520 --> 2:25:37.800]  confronting military force in the hands of mr obama
[2:25:37.800 --> 2:25:41.240]  in a ruthless dictatorship in the short period of time so
[2:25:41.240 --> 2:25:44.840]  it's time to act you need to call your representative and move forward with
[2:25:44.840 --> 2:25:49.000]  articles of it demand that your representative forget the
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:52.440]  politics and move forward with these articles of
[2:25:52.440 --> 2:25:55.320]  impeachment and bear this in mind you representatives
[2:25:55.320 --> 2:26:00.280]  that say we don't want to act obama has already targeted you as an enemy
[2:26:00.280 --> 2:26:03.080]  he's just targeting you as a weak enemy right now
[2:26:03.080 --> 2:26:08.120]  because you haven't act now act be a man and do what you're supposed to do
[2:26:08.120 --> 2:26:11.800]  stand up for this country and introduce these articles of impeachment
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:15.320]  while we still have an opportunity
[2:26:15.320 --> 2:26:18.600]  you're right and and here's the deal we're not being taken over by like boss
[2:26:18.600 --> 2:26:21.160]  hog or something just to be a corrupt guy and skim money
[2:26:21.160 --> 2:26:25.160]  they're going after everybody the bitter clingers they hate us
[2:26:25.160 --> 2:26:28.840]  they're scum look at merkel supporting the rape gangs
[2:26:28.840 --> 2:26:32.440]  i just can't believe we don't allow this scummy of an elite in
[2:26:32.440 --> 2:26:37.400]  that just hate those of us that that are for basic freedom i mean we really are
[2:26:37.400 --> 2:26:40.440]  in the hands of really evil people right now
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:43.640]  and you're a smart guy organization smart you talk a lot of folks in
[2:26:43.640 --> 2:26:47.000]  congress i talked to him as well i just don't know
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:49.960]  why the big elites because i know they're corrupt though would let something
[2:26:49.960 --> 2:26:53.880]  this violent and dangerous in because it's going to go after them as well
[2:26:53.880 --> 2:26:58.120]  i mean this is cancer i agree with that and you know the
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:01.480]  the problem is alex is that the theory and this theory by the way was the
[2:27:01.480 --> 2:27:05.960]  theory proposed initially by adolf hitler which is that national socialism
[2:27:05.960 --> 2:27:10.840]  works better in a muslim society than it does in a christian society
[2:27:10.840 --> 2:27:13.800]  so the concept within the new world order is to
[2:27:13.800 --> 2:27:19.000]  islamify all of western society so that the dictatorship will flow
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:23.400]  more easily and the population will be more easily controlled
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:27.320]  that's the concept the elite continue to believe that they'll be living in you
[2:27:27.320 --> 2:27:31.640]  know high rises in manhattan that will be gated in from the islamic influence
[2:27:31.640 --> 2:27:34.440]  because they're ignorant they you know they actually expect that
[2:27:34.440 --> 2:27:37.640]  national socialism is going to work which is also ignorant
[2:27:37.640 --> 2:27:41.720]  but the reality of the the reality of it is the reality is they're in love with
[2:27:41.720 --> 2:27:45.000]  power and oppression that's exactly right they're
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:48.360]  power hungry people and they go to bed at night thinking about how they're
[2:27:48.360 --> 2:27:51.400]  going to kill five billion human beings look at their top captain is a
[2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:54.920]  literal nazi collaborator who's financing in 14 countries
[2:27:54.920 --> 2:27:58.600]  muslims oppressing christians we had an article this week i mean
[2:27:58.600 --> 2:28:02.120]  they are just they are pure evil i mean you it's true
[2:28:02.120 --> 2:28:05.720]  i mean they really are bad that's right and what they have planned to the
[2:28:05.720 --> 2:28:09.320]  united states is control of the population and of course the
[2:28:09.320 --> 2:28:13.400]  systematic elimination of any people who remember freedom
[2:28:13.400 --> 2:28:16.280]  any people who remember the constitutional republic
[2:28:16.280 --> 2:28:20.280]  any people who remember the american way of life those people have to go
[2:28:20.280 --> 2:28:24.120]  they have to be replaced by subservient slaves who are under the control of some
[2:28:24.120 --> 2:28:27.400]  iman somewhere that allows the elite to pluck them
[2:28:27.400 --> 2:28:30.920]  and to pluck their wealth and to live in their one percent life
[2:28:30.920 --> 2:28:35.080]  while the rest of us starve on the street i mean that's essentially the plan
[2:28:35.080 --> 2:28:38.200]  however and they're financing the whole black lives matter movement going up
[2:28:38.200 --> 2:28:41.240]  against the legitimate police state in some cases but with a leftist
[2:28:41.240 --> 2:28:45.320]  overthrow angle with u n offices opening this year all over the country
[2:28:45.320 --> 2:28:49.080]  for quote strong cities to bully the takeover of local government
[2:28:49.080 --> 2:28:53.880]  i mean this is a total multinational takeover using socialism and radical
[2:28:53.880 --> 2:28:57.240]  islam as the operating system that's correct and
[2:28:57.240 --> 2:29:01.000]  this idea of placing u n offices in the country
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:03.960]  anyone who is in a foreign uniform in the united states
[2:29:03.960 --> 2:29:07.880]  who is armed is at war with the united states period
[2:29:07.880 --> 2:29:12.760]  obama is at war with america that's correct he's declared war on america he's
[2:29:12.760 --> 2:29:16.760]  he's executing the muslim the muslim brotherhood game plan that was published

[2:33:11.960 --> 2:33:16.760]  about a month before they removed baner we had congressman walter jones on and
[2:33:16.760 --> 2:33:21.480]  he led the operation to remove john baner now
[2:33:21.480 --> 2:33:25.720]  we've got paul ryan and i happen to know behind the scenes a lot of congress
[2:33:25.720 --> 2:33:29.240]  folks are looking at articles of impeachment
[2:33:29.240 --> 2:33:33.080]  but they are facing heavy tyranny and a lot of threats
[2:33:33.080 --> 2:33:36.840]  and uh but hillary's in a lot of political trouble right now
[2:33:36.840 --> 2:33:41.080]  more emails more classified info more lies to congress the washington posts
[2:33:41.080 --> 2:33:43.720]  and others are coming out talking about bill clinton settling rape cases and
[2:33:43.720 --> 2:33:48.280]  could he be the new bill cosby we've got the former
[2:33:48.280 --> 2:33:50.760]  candidate or he was going to be a candidate coming back saying maybe he
[2:33:50.760 --> 2:33:55.240]  will be a candidate joe biden so that shows you they're in trouble
[2:33:55.240 --> 2:33:59.080]  but bottom line you cannot have the executive order power grabs that are
[2:33:59.080 --> 2:34:02.120]  happening right now it's unprecedented i played clips
[2:34:02.120 --> 2:34:06.520]  of candidate and early president obama saying it's illegal what he's now doing
[2:34:06.520 --> 2:34:10.520]  bashing bush who deserved to be bashed for some of his executive orders but
[2:34:10.520 --> 2:34:14.040]  obama signed more executive orders than the last six presidents combined
[2:34:14.040 --> 2:34:18.920]  they're draconian it's dangerous and
[2:34:18.920 --> 2:34:24.280]  on so many fronts this country is in a lot of trouble
[2:34:24.280 --> 2:34:29.400]  um i wanted to get our guest on and he came on short notice because
[2:34:29.400 --> 2:34:33.160]  he's been saying for a couple years and then six months ago look for china
[2:34:33.160 --> 2:34:37.000]  bubble to burst uh in december
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:40.600]  uh of last year and it started happening actually about
[2:34:40.600 --> 2:34:44.040]  november and then he said it's going to accelerate i
[2:34:44.040 --> 2:34:46.680]  think it's imminent and and now you've seen
[2:34:46.680 --> 2:34:49.960]  just crazy town trillions disappearing in days
[2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:53.480]  our stock market going down you know thousand points and going back up
[2:34:53.480 --> 2:34:58.040]  um just wild numbers
[2:34:58.120 --> 2:35:02.280]  and so he joins us to speak about this and how it ties into everything but
[2:35:02.280 --> 2:35:08.600]  stock market crash 2016 this is the worst start to a year for stocks ever
[2:35:08.600 --> 2:35:13.160]  that's cnn ever ever worst four now it's five
[2:35:13.160 --> 2:35:16.760]  day run and you got soros hopping up and down saying
[2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:20.920]  you know this is bigger than 2008 will we see new big banker bailouts and some
[2:35:20.920 --> 2:35:24.920]  new bubble and some new i mean it's crazy
[2:35:24.920 --> 2:35:28.840]  and we got democrats calling for obama to declare a national state of emergency
[2:35:28.840 --> 2:35:32.840]  on guns they have executive orders in place where congress is suspended for
[2:35:32.840 --> 2:35:37.160]  six months those are bush and obama executive orders
[2:35:37.160 --> 2:35:42.040]  i mean this is scary times folks and i've talked to high-level special forces
[2:35:42.040 --> 2:35:45.720]  people that say though they're being told get ready for domestic collapse
[2:35:45.720 --> 2:35:49.720]  gun confiscation you name it and they say we're not going to follow the orders so
[2:35:49.720 --> 2:35:54.280]  this is a crazy time to be alive our news websites are info wars.com and

[2:37:32.200 --> 2:37:34.920]  believe all the graphs the demographic cliffs show it
[2:37:34.920 --> 2:37:37.880]  you had the cultural decay the laziness of the west
[2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:41.560]  the militants the weapons all over the world the pentagon the ministry
[2:37:41.560 --> 2:37:47.000]  defense they say 2016 to 2022 is going to be
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:51.400]  over the top wild so don't strap yourselves in you don't want to be a
[2:37:51.400 --> 2:37:54.200]  spectator in this you want to be involved the worst place to be as a
[2:37:54.200 --> 2:37:57.320]  spectator this is not a spectator sport so there's
[2:37:57.320 --> 2:37:59.320]  my intro he joins us till the end of the hour

[2:38:07.320 --> 2:38:10.760]  harry dent author of the demographic cliff a former top
[2:38:10.760 --> 2:38:14.520]  guy of course over there doing big corporate turnarounds
[2:38:14.520 --> 2:38:18.920]  i like that not just takeovers for vane capital harry dent
[2:38:18.920 --> 2:38:22.040]  dot com harvard a business school graduate and more
[2:38:22.040 --> 2:38:25.000]  i'm not going to go over the rest of it people know who he is
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:27.960]  and he's also offering a deal still where you just pay the shipping and get his
[2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:30.360]  book three that's how much he wants to get it out for
[2:38:30.360 --> 2:38:34.280]  it's like 495 or something i know he loses money on that the book cost
[2:38:34.280 --> 2:38:37.240]  that to just get it into your hands the demographic cliff
[2:38:37.240 --> 2:38:40.600]  okay we've gone over the charts we've covered a lot of that the point is what
[2:38:40.600 --> 2:38:44.200]  you've said is basically happening just as you said it would just as your last
[2:38:44.200 --> 2:38:47.080]  predictions came early true tell us what's happening
[2:38:47.080 --> 2:38:51.320]  currently and then what you expect now the optics are closer and clearer
[2:38:51.320 --> 2:38:55.480]  with the electron microscope what the next shoe to drop is mr dent
[2:38:55.480 --> 2:38:58.680]  well again i've been looking at china number one
[2:38:58.680 --> 2:39:02.760]  because they have the greatest bubble in the world they have overbuilt their
[2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:07.960]  economy for 12 to 15 years in the future massive migration into cities where
[2:39:07.960 --> 2:39:11.800]  people don't really have jobs they haven't building stuff for nobody
[2:39:11.800 --> 2:39:16.920]  and that's what they've been doing for 15 years that i have never seen a bubble
[2:39:16.920 --> 2:39:21.000]  to compare to this so i'm saying look we have a bubble around the world
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:24.680]  in demographic spending which keeps declining in more countries and i'm
[2:39:24.680 --> 2:39:29.080]  coming we can predict this by country japan was the first to peak and then the
[2:39:29.080 --> 2:39:32.360]  u.s and now europe but we also have the greatest
[2:39:32.360 --> 2:39:37.000]  debt bubble in modern history two to four times what we've seen back in the
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:41.160]  roaring 20s last time we had a debt bubble and all we need
[2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:45.560]  like in 2008 with the subprime crisis is a trigger
[2:39:45.560 --> 2:39:52.360]  to cause this debt bubble to reset and and deleverage or what i call a financial
[2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:56.760]  detox and this is happening i've been looking at china number one because it
[2:39:56.760 --> 2:40:00.680]  had the greatest stock bubble in the shortest period of time
[2:40:00.680 --> 2:40:04.360]  with the least sophisticated investors who were jumping out of the real estate
[2:40:04.360 --> 2:40:08.120]  bubble there to get into the stock bubble and now it's collapsing and the
[2:40:08.120 --> 2:40:13.320]  government is doing the same thing alexa did in 1929 when the u.s stock bubble
[2:40:13.320 --> 2:40:17.560]  started to burst both bubbles went down 42 percent
[2:40:17.560 --> 2:40:21.080]  in two and a half months and then the government steps in and starts buying
[2:40:21.080 --> 2:40:26.040]  its own stock market to try to prop it up and only lasts about four months before
[2:40:26.040 --> 2:40:31.160]  the bubble collapse and get worse you cannot stop a bubble from bursting once
[2:40:31.160 --> 2:40:33.400]  you create it the only way you can stop a bubble
[2:40:33.400 --> 2:40:36.920]  is not to create it in the first place and nobody gets that
[2:40:36.920 --> 2:40:40.840]  we are in a bubble around the world commodities we've been predicting for
[2:40:40.840 --> 2:40:45.080]  years it's already collapsed nobody thought oil would be a 32 dollars a
[2:40:45.080 --> 2:40:48.280]  barrel we said it would be 20 to 30 dollars a barrel
[2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:52.680]  years ago uh nobody thought that that uh
[2:40:52.680 --> 2:40:56.680]  you know that the u.s bubble would burst in real estate in 2005
[2:40:56.680 --> 2:41:00.200]  we said it'll burst now it's going to burst more so
[2:41:00.200 --> 2:41:04.520]  investors and people need to say look we've had this great bubble it's been
[2:41:04.520 --> 2:41:08.280]  artificially stimulated by governments around the world especially the fed here
[2:41:08.280 --> 2:41:11.800]  in the united states take your gains from the bubble
[2:41:11.800 --> 2:41:16.200]  and turn it back into cash and liquidity so you can survive
[2:41:16.200 --> 2:41:19.880]  this crash that's going to happen it is going to be worse and we just said this
[2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:25.720]  in our january newsletter 2016 is going to go down i think is the worst
[2:41:25.720 --> 2:41:32.600]  year for the stock market not since 2008 not since 2001 since 1931
[2:41:32.600 --> 2:41:37.480]  because this crash is going to happen rapidly and it's starting in china and
[2:41:37.480 --> 2:41:40.280]  that's what i've been looking for i finally told people
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:43.960]  late last year gosh the thing i've been looking for
[2:41:43.960 --> 2:41:49.240]  in the last couple years is for a major bubble to burst not just oil which was
[2:41:49.240 --> 2:41:52.280]  first but the second one is china's bubble bursting
[2:41:52.280 --> 2:41:56.680]  and they're not going to be able to so you're saying we're facing another
[2:41:56.680 --> 2:42:01.400]  great depression generally or the same numbers in the stock market
[2:42:01.400 --> 2:42:05.480]  yeah actually we're facing a bigger crash than 2008
[2:42:05.480 --> 2:42:10.360]  which was about 55 percent in 17 months i think we're going to see 70 percent
[2:42:10.360 --> 2:42:14.200]  in the next year year and a half and ultimately a little more than that down
[2:42:14.200 --> 2:42:17.960]  the road we are going to see a great depression
[2:42:17.960 --> 2:42:23.320]  we started to see the great depression which i forecast back in 2007 and
[2:42:23.320 --> 2:42:26.040]  2008 we started to see you're saying the new
[2:42:26.040 --> 2:42:30.520]  great depression is basically months away yeah i think it's going to happen
[2:42:30.520 --> 2:42:35.320]  between this year 2016 and 2020 and they're
[2:42:35.320 --> 2:42:38.360]  getting ready to take the guns on top of it i tell you this is a recipe for just
[2:42:38.360 --> 2:42:43.160]  explosions please continue yeah and again
[2:42:43.160 --> 2:42:47.240]  people don't realize nobody's seen this happen in their lifetime the last time
[2:42:47.240 --> 2:42:52.920]  we had a bubble burst in debt and financial assets stocks commodities
[2:42:52.920 --> 2:42:56.200]  real estate everything was in the early 30s and the stock
[2:42:56.200 --> 2:43:00.280]  market went down 89 percent in two and a half years
[2:43:00.280 --> 2:43:05.720]  real estate went down 26 percent 30 61 percent in new york never came back for
[2:43:05.720 --> 2:43:08.840]  debt age stocks didn't come back for 25 years
[2:43:08.840 --> 2:43:13.240]  this is something major you have to get out of the way of this it's a matter of
[2:43:13.240 --> 2:43:17.560]  survival and then when these bubbles burst whether
[2:43:17.560 --> 2:43:21.000]  it's real estate in new york or beachfront property in
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:24.680]  florida or anywhere else you're going to be able to buy stuff it
[2:43:24.680 --> 2:43:28.840]  rates you will not believe if you protect your wealth now
[2:43:28.840 --> 2:43:32.440]  and wait until the crash i understand you're about surviving and thriving in
[2:43:32.440 --> 2:43:35.960]  bad times but getting back to your demographic cliff all your
[2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:39.720]  charts the things you you know you use it a bit bane to be able to successfully
[2:43:39.720 --> 2:43:42.760]  predict things in all your best-selling books specifically
[2:43:42.760 --> 2:43:46.360]  i mean you know because at a certain point it does get down to tea leaves on
[2:43:46.360 --> 2:43:50.120]  on exact times two months three months six months i mean we'll be in a great
[2:43:50.120 --> 2:43:52.280]  depression they'll be telling us everything's great like they tell us
[2:43:52.280 --> 2:43:57.000]  obamacare is free but how deep will this have to get before they
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:44:00.280]  admit it's a depression i mean obviously most third world countries are
[2:44:00.280 --> 2:44:03.320]  already in a depression they're in flames so so
[2:44:03.320 --> 2:44:06.840]  there is a global depression it's just not evenly distributed but how long
[2:44:06.840 --> 2:44:11.080]  until it hits here how bad will it be distributed say here versus australia
[2:44:11.080 --> 2:44:15.080]  versus china versus europe versus russia where are the worst places were the
[2:44:15.080 --> 2:44:18.600]  best places okay first of all we've been waiting
[2:44:18.600 --> 2:44:21.720]  for a long time to see i mean the governments have been
[2:44:21.720 --> 2:44:26.040]  keeping this bubble going by printing trillions of dollars like 10 12 trillion
[2:44:26.040 --> 2:44:29.320]  dollars in the last several years they've been filling in the downturn
[2:44:29.320 --> 2:44:33.720]  they didn't do that in the 1930s so in the 1930s the stock market peaked in
[2:44:33.720 --> 2:44:37.720]  1929 when demographics would have said it would and it just went down
[2:44:37.720 --> 2:44:42.120]  well no they've kept this bubble going but we've been looking for
[2:44:42.120 --> 2:44:45.240]  the final signs where i call the smart money
[2:44:45.240 --> 2:44:49.400]  it is exiting the market when this happens when the largest companies like
[2:44:49.400 --> 2:44:55.240]  google and apple and netflix and amazon are going straight up and most
[2:44:55.240 --> 2:44:58.200]  companies 80 of the companies are going down
[2:44:58.200 --> 2:45:02.600]  the average company in the stock industry are down 20 percent right now
[2:45:02.600 --> 2:45:07.160]  while these big companies are making new highs at unbelievable valuation that is
[2:45:07.160 --> 2:45:10.440]  the sign that the bubble is finally peaking
[2:45:10.440 --> 2:45:14.520]  and and so i think this bubble is going to burst it's starting to burst now
[2:45:14.520 --> 2:45:17.800]  the half december and january be the worst
[2:45:17.800 --> 2:45:24.120]  in in decades is a sign that something's wrong this happened in 2001 it
[2:45:24.120 --> 2:45:28.840]  happened in 2007 and eight this was a sign that something's wrong and i think
[2:45:28.840 --> 2:45:32.040]  you're going to see not a correction not a 10 20
[2:45:32.040 --> 2:45:36.200]  percent correction that the most conservative analysts are calling for
[2:45:36.200 --> 2:45:39.560]  i think you're going to see a great crash in the next year well you've been
[2:45:39.560 --> 2:45:43.400]  right over and over and over again it it's sickening feeling because i don't
[2:45:43.400 --> 2:45:45.800]  want you to be right but i mean you're one of the most accurate people out
[2:45:45.800 --> 2:45:48.600]  there i'm not just saying that people can all witness it
[2:45:48.600 --> 2:45:52.040]  i wish you were wrong what do you say just because i have to do this to the
[2:45:52.040 --> 2:45:54.440]  naysayers and even do this in mainstream media
[2:45:54.440 --> 2:45:58.440]  new york times oh we're fear porn oh well you know
[2:45:58.440 --> 2:46:03.000]  we're gonna or we're gonna cause a crash by saying all this that's like saying
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:06.120]  well you caused bernie made off to go under because you pointed out he was a
[2:46:06.120 --> 2:46:08.680]  fraud you know the fraudsters are okay the
[2:46:08.680 --> 2:46:11.640]  derivative sellers are okay those of us that point out
[2:46:11.640 --> 2:46:15.400]  historical trends we're bad how do you respond to that
[2:46:15.400 --> 2:46:19.880]  well well first of all i was the most bullish economist in all of us history
[2:46:19.880 --> 2:46:23.880]  from the late eighties forward because i saw this massive baby boom coming
[2:46:23.880 --> 2:46:27.240]  they're the largest generation in history the largest since the american
[2:46:27.240 --> 2:46:31.560]  revolution back 250 years ago and these people were going to
[2:46:31.560 --> 2:46:36.440]  predictably cause the greatest boom and bubble you want to be you want to be
[2:46:36.440 --> 2:46:39.800]  bullish but i mean the fact is this is the season of the bear
[2:46:39.800 --> 2:46:43.960]  well yeah exactly but but we had that boom in the baby boom first peak in
[2:46:43.960 --> 2:46:47.960]  japan that's why i called my book the demographic clip the first baby boom
[2:46:47.960 --> 2:46:51.240]  to peak was in japan in the late 80s the mid 90s
[2:46:51.240 --> 2:46:54.760]  they fell off the cliff look at japan ever since they've been down their
[2:46:54.760 --> 2:46:57.960]  stock market is still 55 off their highs real estate
[2:46:57.960 --> 2:47:01.800]  found 60 never recovered and their stock market was down 80
[2:47:01.800 --> 2:47:05.640]  percent worse japan has just gone through what the rest of the world
[2:47:05.640 --> 2:47:09.080]  the u.s went through it next and now europe is going to hit it
[2:47:09.080 --> 2:47:12.360]  and everybody thinks germany is going to hold up the eurozone
[2:47:12.360 --> 2:47:17.160]  and germany has the worst demographics of any single country
[2:47:17.160 --> 2:47:21.560]  in the next decade and nobody sees and i don't think giant third world
[2:47:21.560 --> 2:47:25.800]  right gangs are going to replace them yeah no exactly i mean you can't fight
[2:47:25.800 --> 2:47:29.320]  demographics but the worst thing alex is that
[2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:33.960]  when times are good especially when the fed jumps in and makes interest rates
[2:47:33.960 --> 2:47:37.560]  low and tells everybody to buy a house whether they're in court or not
[2:47:37.560 --> 2:47:42.920]  you get these bubbles in speculation and real estate and stocks and and and
[2:47:42.920 --> 2:47:48.760]  debt and this debt bubble is when you count all the unfunded liabilities for
[2:47:48.760 --> 2:47:52.840]  health care and and and social security and
[2:47:52.840 --> 2:47:57.000]  government debt and private debt and and people worry about 18 trillion in
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:47:59.080]  government debt that is the least of our problems
[2:47:59.080 --> 2:48:02.360]  i agree we we have so much more debt like
[2:48:02.360 --> 2:48:06.920]  eight times our gdp at the minimum well how many quadrillions are there in
[2:48:06.920 --> 2:48:11.320]  derivatives oh 70 trillion just and i mean
[2:48:11.320 --> 2:48:14.840]  and in derivatives are total speculation there's supposed to be
[2:48:14.840 --> 2:48:18.120]  insurance against bonds and stuff there's no collateral
[2:48:18.120 --> 2:48:21.720]  real insurance has collateral behind it so this is just another way to
[2:48:21.720 --> 2:48:24.840]  speculate another way for wall street to say
[2:48:24.840 --> 2:48:27.880]  oh you don't have to worry about all these risk and bubbles we've got it
[2:48:27.880 --> 2:48:31.880]  insured you got an assured by who speculators and 30 times leverage as
[2:48:31.880 --> 2:48:34.840]  soon as something goes wrong get broke they're not going to be able to stand
[2:48:34.840 --> 2:48:39.400]  behind these demographically to how bad will crime get during a depression
[2:48:39.400 --> 2:48:43.320]  okay i look back in the 1930s alex and and and
[2:48:43.320 --> 2:48:49.160]  anytime in history crime and unemployment are directly correlated
[2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:53.720]  and stock crashes and suicides are directly correlated
[2:48:53.720 --> 2:48:59.800]  so so crime uh and and homicides were the highest in 1933 when unemployment was
[2:48:59.800 --> 2:49:03.240]  the highest in the great depression and suicides were the highest
[2:49:03.240 --> 2:49:07.000]  in mid to late 1932 when the stock market bottom so
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:11.640]  you're going to see uh civil unrest you're going to see rising crime
[2:49:11.640 --> 2:49:15.400]  but it's going to come from rising unemployment
[2:49:15.400 --> 2:49:19.160]  after this big bubble's been built and and and if you think it's bad in the
[2:49:19.160 --> 2:49:25.000]  united states imagine a half a billion i'm talking i said a half a billion
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:30.040]  migrants uneducated migrants from rural areas in china that only in the last
[2:49:30.040 --> 2:49:34.360]  15 years have moved into cities and they're building stuff for nobody and
[2:49:34.360 --> 2:49:38.600]  when that building boom stuff start what are these people going to do
[2:49:38.600 --> 2:49:42.200]  you're going to have a half a billion people in chinese cities
[2:49:42.200 --> 2:49:47.320]  unemployed china already had more than 50 million people it's estimated since
[2:49:47.320 --> 2:49:51.800]  maltook over starved death can you imagine the starvation this time
[2:49:51.800 --> 2:49:57.240]  yeah i mean i worry i don't worry is europe has worse demographics in the
[2:49:57.240 --> 2:49:59.640]  united states you said you know where's it going to be the worst
[2:49:59.640 --> 2:50:04.840]  east asia japan but but in the united states we have much more
[2:50:04.840 --> 2:50:10.040]  income inequality and china has this massive migration that's never been
[2:50:10.040 --> 2:50:15.080]  properly assimilated and i hate to say the one thing about europe is they have
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:18.760]  their immigrants especially the muslims are not as integrated
[2:50:18.760 --> 2:50:21.720]  nowhere near as here so so you're going to see
[2:50:21.720 --> 2:50:25.880]  i think civil unrest on a level we haven't seen in our lifetime and i hate to
[2:50:25.880 --> 2:50:28.840]  say that but it's just like you know it's true it's we're sitting on top of
[2:50:28.840 --> 2:50:33.160]  roadwire time bomb good god we are oh my it's just and i mean that's it's it's
[2:50:33.160 --> 2:50:36.760]  clear we're steaming towards it whether it's a month six months a year when we

[2:54:03.960 --> 2:54:07.000]  five-minute segment coming up and then Anthony Gutiarty is going to host the
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:10.440]  fourth hour with the same situation the gun grab that's
[2:54:10.440 --> 2:54:16.600]  going on the power grabbing uh the the open borders just the
[2:54:16.600 --> 2:54:20.120]  lawlessness establishment obviously scurrying around getting ready for
[2:54:20.120 --> 2:54:24.280]  political upheaval and trying to exacerbate it as much as they
[2:54:24.280 --> 2:54:27.080]  can i guess to use the crisis to get even more
[2:54:27.080 --> 2:54:30.120]  power but getting past all that what are we going to do
[2:54:30.120 --> 2:54:34.760]  individually looking at the united states and the rest of the world
[2:54:34.760 --> 2:54:37.880]  um they're pretty much signaling now that things
[2:54:37.880 --> 2:54:42.680]  are in big trouble global implosion if you say it's as bad as the great
[2:54:42.680 --> 2:54:46.760]  depression you add all the bigger populations
[2:54:46.760 --> 2:54:49.720]  all the fact that tower of babel you were just mentioning people don't you
[2:54:49.720 --> 2:54:54.040]  know get along as well uh we don't have more homogenious populations
[2:54:54.040 --> 2:54:57.240]  anywhere you know it's in other parts of the world as well
[2:54:57.240 --> 2:55:02.600]  what is that signal and what's the time frame well again i think the worst year
[2:55:02.600 --> 2:55:06.360]  is going to be 2016 early 2017 the next year
[2:55:06.360 --> 2:55:10.200]  or a little more i think that's when the stock crash is going to hit the hardest
[2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:14.440]  just like it did in 2008 it happened in 17 months
[2:55:14.440 --> 2:55:18.680]  and and 80 percent of that stock crash happened in five months between june and
[2:55:18.680 --> 2:55:21.720]  early november 2008 it's going to be like that
[2:55:21.720 --> 2:55:25.240]  stocks are going to get hit the worst the fastest real estate is going to take
[2:55:25.240 --> 2:55:29.720]  years to come down businesses are going to go under so so if you've got a
[2:55:29.720 --> 2:55:33.160]  business then you're thinking in retiring you should sell your business
[2:55:33.160 --> 2:55:37.160]  now or you should have hunkered down to survive and know
[2:55:37.160 --> 2:55:40.600]  that if you are leaner and meaner then your competitors you're going to come
[2:55:40.600 --> 2:55:44.360]  out of this ahead if you got stocks you should sell them
[2:55:44.360 --> 2:55:48.520]  i mean people say oh but i got proctor and gamble and it's got a high dividend
[2:55:48.520 --> 2:55:52.200]  i don't care even in the great depression companies like proctor and
[2:55:52.200 --> 2:55:56.600]  gamble went down 50 60 70 80 percent and some companies stopped paying the
[2:55:56.600 --> 2:56:00.920]  dividend so if you want a dividend get a 30-year treasury bond
[2:56:00.920 --> 2:56:04.440]  that is the safest thing you can buy and people keep saying the u.s dollar is
[2:56:04.440 --> 2:56:07.240]  going to go down no we're the best house in a bad
[2:56:07.240 --> 2:56:10.360]  neighborhood and that's been proven over several years and we've been saying
[2:56:10.360 --> 2:56:14.760]  that as well so get safe get in stock just protect your wealth
[2:56:14.760 --> 2:56:19.480]  the the key to prospering in a deflationary downturn like this which
[2:56:19.480 --> 2:56:24.200]  only comes once in a lifetime like the 1930s and nobody's alive then tell us
[2:56:24.200 --> 2:56:27.800]  about that is that you protect your wealth
[2:56:27.800 --> 2:56:32.040]  and then reinvest after the bubbles burst let me expand on that what about
[2:56:32.040 --> 2:56:34.680]  more speculative things what do you see
[2:56:34.680 --> 2:56:37.640]  because bitcoin's up right now what do you see happening deeper into this with
[2:56:37.640 --> 2:56:41.240]  things like bitcoin you know no bitcoin i think it is
[2:56:41.240 --> 2:56:44.600]  is the beginning of something in the future but it's not established yet and
[2:56:44.600 --> 2:56:47.480]  it's just as volatile as gold i wouldn't be buying bitcoin
[2:56:47.480 --> 2:56:52.120]  and i even more i wouldn't be buying gold gold did great in the 70s when
[2:56:52.120 --> 2:56:55.720]  inflation was the trend but with deflation and
[2:56:55.720 --> 2:56:59.240]  debt deleveraging the trend gold keeps going down
[2:56:59.240 --> 2:57:03.960]  i've got reports on this off the charts it's just unbelievable that people to
[2:57:03.960 --> 2:57:07.160]  understand people think gold is a crisis hedge
[2:57:07.160 --> 2:57:11.080]  it's an inflation hedge and we're not dealing with inflation
[2:57:11.080 --> 2:57:16.040]  how could we have such low inflation after 12 trillion dollars with printed
[2:57:16.040 --> 2:57:19.880]  around the world by that central bank it's because they're printing money to
[2:57:19.880 --> 2:57:23.640]  fight deflation and deflation is not gold's
[2:57:23.640 --> 2:57:28.200]  ally it's not stocks or real estate the only thing that does well in deflation
[2:57:28.200 --> 2:57:34.520]  is high quality long-term treasury bonds and triple a corporate bonds that's
[2:57:34.520 --> 2:57:37.400]  the only two things that did well in the 1930s
[2:57:37.400 --> 2:57:41.720]  everything else went down and that's what i have to keep telling people alex
[2:57:41.720 --> 2:57:45.800]  it this is not like the 1970s or other recessions we've had
[2:57:45.800 --> 2:57:50.840]  where some things go up some things go down in a bubble burst like this
[2:57:50.840 --> 2:57:55.400]  everything goes down except for the primary so by what time next year will
[2:57:55.400 --> 2:58:00.200]  it be evident for this year i think between now
[2:58:00.200 --> 2:58:04.040]  in july you're going to see the first big crash not a small we've only seen
[2:58:04.040 --> 2:58:08.040]  small crashes so thus far around china and oil we've been
[2:58:08.040 --> 2:58:12.440]  warning those are two things to look at oil prices go down watch out and when
[2:58:12.440 --> 2:58:15.640]  china stocks go down watch out i think you're going to see the first
[2:58:15.640 --> 2:58:19.160]  crash by july and i think you're going to see the worst of it by
[2:58:19.160 --> 2:58:23.880]  late 2016 early to mid 2017 it will last
[2:58:23.880 --> 2:58:27.160]  beyond that up and down but you're going to see the worst there
[2:58:27.160 --> 2:58:31.400]  and so this is the year protect yourself after that it's going to be easier
[2:58:31.400 --> 2:58:35.400]  to deal with this all right mr dent harry dent dot com thank you so much

[2:59:49.560 --> 3:00:10.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:11.160 --> 3:00:15.320]  the world is a dangerous place not because of evil
[3:00:15.320 --> 3:00:19.640]  but because of those who look on and do nothing
[3:00:19.640 --> 3:00:24.040]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:00:24.040 --> 3:00:28.200]  we now take you live to the central texas command center
[3:00:28.200 --> 3:00:42.280]  it's alex jones
[3:00:42.280 --> 3:00:46.600]  take of all those people
[3:00:47.880 --> 3:00:53.000]  who told you there was no planetary corporate takeover plan
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:00:59.080]  no femur camps no forced inoculations no smart cars that
[3:00:59.080 --> 3:01:02.520]  tax you by the mile no government plan to take over your
[3:01:02.520 --> 3:01:06.520]  families and claim your children belong to the state
[3:01:06.520 --> 3:01:15.480]  but the government wasn't involved with al-qaeda or i now it's all admitted
[3:01:15.480 --> 3:01:19.480]  can you hear me is the question
[3:01:19.480 --> 3:01:22.200]  can you hear me
[3:01:23.240 --> 3:01:26.680]  don't believe in the church or the state
[3:01:26.680 --> 3:01:30.600]  believe in me i'm with the high command

[3:01:37.400 --> 3:01:39.960]  i've always got them ready but i've been getting them
[3:01:39.960 --> 3:01:46.520]  extra ready right here all day on the table
[3:01:52.520 --> 3:01:56.040]  that's right that's what will guide you not the mainstream medium
[3:01:56.040 --> 3:02:02.760]  spirit and the spirit's going to get a lot stronger because when evil comes in
[3:02:02.760 --> 3:02:09.080]  like a flood the spirit of the lord lifts up a standard against it
[3:02:09.080 --> 3:02:16.040]  now is the time to get serious they say we rise to the occasion and i know
[3:02:16.040 --> 3:02:18.680]  that's what many people have been doing and i know i've been doing that as well
[3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:21.800]  i've been working harder i've been more focused
[3:02:21.800 --> 3:02:26.440]  i have been healthier i've been
[3:02:27.560 --> 3:02:33.000]  angrier but overall in a better psychological position
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:36.120]  because i realized that
[3:02:36.520 --> 3:02:40.920]  we really are right about what we're doing it really is cut and dried
[3:02:40.920 --> 3:02:44.920]  we really are facing very bad people
[3:02:45.960 --> 3:02:49.080]  that have it out for us
[3:02:49.080 --> 3:02:54.760]  and trying to suck up to them
[3:02:55.720 --> 3:03:00.360]  once there's a real takeover means in many cases you're actually the first
[3:03:00.360 --> 3:03:04.760]  people they're dying on
[3:03:09.240 --> 3:03:13.560]  but a lot of these elites are cowards and so
[3:03:13.560 --> 3:03:19.560]  they crouch down and lick the greater hands that feed them and just to call
[3:03:19.560 --> 3:03:25.880]  Patrick Henry i say look may your change set lightly upon you
[3:03:27.880 --> 3:03:32.840]  you know to an engineered conditioned brainwashed minion of the system
[3:03:32.840 --> 3:03:39.960]  an obama supporter a radio tv host with a 357 magnum in his hand
[3:03:39.960 --> 3:03:43.320]  and i have this because it's very accurate when you actually got adrenaline
[3:03:43.320 --> 3:03:45.960]  going you're not going to have mistakes you're
[3:03:45.960 --> 3:03:50.760]  not going to have misfires you're not going to have problems statistically
[3:03:54.280 --> 3:03:58.440]  they could see obama with 50 secret service or michael more with six
[3:03:58.440 --> 3:04:02.440]  armed guards and they just feel good about that but they see a fellow slave
[3:04:02.440 --> 3:04:07.560]  with a gun and they recoil because subconsciously they see you as food
[3:04:07.560 --> 3:04:12.680]  the the minions they see themselves as dictators with their daddy
[3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:16.600]  and they don't like seeing you off the plantation off the reservation
[3:04:16.600 --> 3:04:20.280]  they want to make sure you're in line well we're not in line with our own
[3:04:20.280 --> 3:04:23.240]  destruction we're not gonna crouch down and lick
[3:04:23.240 --> 3:04:26.520]  your boots we're gonna die on our feet and by the way history shows when we get
[3:04:26.520 --> 3:04:32.440]  ready to die on our feet the bad guys really start doing the dying
[3:04:32.440 --> 3:04:36.120]  they've taken our restraint and our kindness for weakness
[3:04:36.120 --> 3:04:45.480]  but as history shows over and over again in the end they will beg
[3:04:45.480 --> 3:04:49.640]  we're winning the info war so the enemy wants to overturn the tables
[3:04:49.640 --> 3:04:54.200]  intensify everything you do and spread the word about beacons of truth

[3:09:16.040 --> 3:09:20.120]  go to a five-star restaurant right the most amazing steakhouse you walk in the
[3:09:20.120 --> 3:09:23.000]  door and someone goes sir sir let me bring you right to your table

[3:09:34.520 --> 3:09:37.400]  of this fillet oh absolutely absolutely and they
[3:09:37.400 --> 3:09:41.640]  bring out a tray of mcdonald's with maggots all over it
[3:09:41.640 --> 3:09:45.000]  that's kind of what the mainstream media does to us
[3:09:45.000 --> 3:09:48.760]  we want truth we want reality we want real news we want
[3:09:48.760 --> 3:09:52.680]  just crunchy realness but they bring out a tray
[3:09:52.680 --> 3:09:57.160]  of maggots and mcdonald's we say well you know

[3:10:00.440 --> 3:10:04.680]  i guess i'll just shove the maggots in my mouth and make the best of it
[3:10:04.680 --> 3:10:07.960]  well i don't think we have to do that anymore and i'm done with it and i'm
[3:10:07.960 --> 3:10:12.120]  not going to eat the maggots i want the juicy juicy fillet of reality

[3:10:36.040 --> 3:10:38.120]  we're gonna premiere it at the bottom of the hour it's only like three minutes

[3:10:41.560 --> 3:10:44.520]  and hey fun to us it's expensive running this operation
[3:10:44.520 --> 3:10:47.640]  i keep forgetting to plug stuff and i keep skipping network breaks the time
[3:10:47.640 --> 3:10:51.720]  i got to quit that should probably stop that it's like we haven't
[3:10:51.720 --> 3:10:55.800]  anyways it's coming up well it's the last day to use gift 15 too to get 15
[3:10:55.800 --> 3:10:58.520]  percent off the entire store you have the calendar with macadamia
[3:10:58.520 --> 3:11:01.560]  calendar it is actually really well done calendar
[3:11:01.560 --> 3:11:05.400]  it's a glossy surprise quality but it's the last day to use gift 15 to get 15
[3:11:05.400 --> 3:11:09.720]  percent off the entire info was store which includes info wars life
[3:11:09.720 --> 3:11:14.360]  this is ending i guess tonight at midnight so make sure you use it now
[3:11:14.360 --> 3:11:17.400]  and actually support the operation and get the awesome products
[3:11:17.400 --> 3:11:20.120]  for me right now xd was always the number one bet
[3:11:20.120 --> 3:11:23.560]  it's always been my favorite info wars life product it means the flagship right
[3:11:23.560 --> 3:11:27.000]  it's the standard it's the first product ever by info wars life
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:31.240]  i remember when alex released it i guess about three years ago now
[3:11:31.240 --> 3:11:34.200]  it was a constant battle to get it back in stock
[3:11:34.200 --> 3:11:37.400]  now it's pretty much still the case but at least we have some so go to
[3:11:37.400 --> 3:11:41.480]  infowarslife.com and use gift 15 and also like you said this calendar
[3:11:41.480 --> 3:11:45.240]  which is uh really pretty cool and what's interesting about the calendar is
[3:11:45.240 --> 3:11:48.760]  there's promo codes in it every month so you can save
[3:11:48.760 --> 3:11:54.120]  i think it's up to 25 or 30 percent every single month so you're already making
[3:11:54.120 --> 3:11:58.360]  the money back if you buy essentially one thing in the store after you get
[3:11:58.360 --> 3:12:01.160]  this calendar which is six dollars you're already making your money back
[3:12:01.160 --> 3:12:05.720]  because you're using a promo code to save up to 20 or 30 percent
[3:12:05.720 --> 3:12:10.040]  so go to info store support the operation and you know talking about money
[3:12:10.040 --> 3:12:13.400]  actually i'll just break right into it first i want to open up the phone lines
[3:12:13.400 --> 3:12:19.400]  to pretty much whatever's on your mind at 1-800-259-9231
[3:12:19.400 --> 3:12:24.600]  1-800-259-9231 you know open up the phone lines for you guys
[3:12:24.600 --> 3:12:27.960]  but one of the points i wanted to talk about actually was the truth about money
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:31.000]  the radical truth about money that no one seems to get
[3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:36.600]  that no one seems to understand except for the people that really have it
[3:12:36.600 --> 3:12:40.520]  and uh except for the people that really know what's going on
[3:12:40.520 --> 3:12:44.360]  and you talk about money right you talk about this weird taboo subject of
[3:12:44.360 --> 3:12:47.160]  money that you're not allowed to talk about at the dinner table it's rude
[3:12:47.160 --> 3:12:50.680]  how dare you talk about something that really is you know
[3:12:50.680 --> 3:12:55.080]  what most people exist unfortunately for right they go to jobs they hate just to
[3:12:55.080 --> 3:12:58.520]  make that dollar so they could pay their rent so they can exist
[3:12:58.520 --> 3:13:02.760]  in a wooden house and and just exist it's just money is everything to some
[3:13:02.760 --> 3:13:06.440]  people unfortunately they probably don't even want it to be that way right
[3:13:06.440 --> 3:13:10.760]  but here's the real truth about money the truth about money is i'm going to
[3:13:10.760 --> 3:13:14.680]  show you some articles on this subject too including how a chinese hospital
[3:13:14.680 --> 3:13:21.960]  was bulldozed with patients inside and how gm wouldn't pay 90 cents to
[3:13:21.960 --> 3:13:25.080]  fix their cars and instead according to bloomberg
[3:13:25.080 --> 3:13:30.680]  loud 125 people to die so that's the bad side right but the truth about money is
[3:13:30.680 --> 3:13:35.480]  we need more good people to have it and i always hear people
[3:13:35.480 --> 3:13:38.520]  quote or miss quote they miss quote the bible and they say
[3:13:38.520 --> 3:13:42.360]  well anthony money is the root of all evil
[3:13:42.360 --> 3:13:46.360]  money is the root of all evil jesus said so
[3:13:46.360 --> 3:13:49.960]  actually that's that's not what jesus said jesus said
[3:13:49.960 --> 3:13:54.360]  love of money is the root of all evil love of money
[3:13:54.360 --> 3:13:59.160]  not money because i'll flip i'll flip the argument around right
[3:13:59.160 --> 3:14:03.800]  guns are the root of all evil well the gun doesn't shoot anybody
[3:14:03.800 --> 3:14:07.720]  the dollar doesn't shoot you doesn't kill you doesn't do anything
[3:14:07.720 --> 3:14:11.480]  sure it's all ripped off by the federal reserve but the dollar itself what it
[3:14:11.480 --> 3:14:14.680]  represents the currency system or maybe gold rather
[3:14:14.680 --> 3:14:18.680]  would you rather me say a piece of gold it is not inherently evil it's what you
[3:14:18.680 --> 3:14:24.200]  choose to do with it it is a tool it is a fuel source
[3:14:24.200 --> 3:14:27.800]  so you're either fueling up an operation that is
[3:14:27.800 --> 3:14:31.160]  helping people right or you're fueling up something
[3:14:31.160 --> 3:14:35.960]  that is destroying and hurting and my whole philosophy is i don't support
[3:14:35.960 --> 3:14:39.640]  corporations that harm people with the money that i give them
[3:14:39.640 --> 3:14:42.680]  so if i'm going to go out and buy something i don't want to buy something
[3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:45.480]  made in a chinese slave factory where they're trying to jump out of the
[3:14:45.480 --> 3:14:48.360]  buildings and kill themselves because they don't want to work anymore for a
[3:14:48.360 --> 3:14:52.280]  penny a week or free or whatever i don't want to support that
[3:14:52.280 --> 3:14:56.120]  but do i vote with my dollar and buy awesome products
[3:14:56.120 --> 3:15:02.040]  that support operations that i enjoy or support non-profits of course
[3:15:02.040 --> 3:15:05.640]  so the truth is we need more good people to have money
[3:15:05.640 --> 3:15:09.080]  i want you to make as much money as you possibly can and do good things with it
[3:15:09.080 --> 3:15:12.280]  i want corporations and companies that are good to make tons of money
[3:15:12.280 --> 3:15:15.880]  i'm an entrepreneur i like to generate financial success
[3:15:15.880 --> 3:15:19.560]  for good people and good companies and myself
[3:15:19.560 --> 3:15:22.840]  is there anything wrong with that absolutely not it enables me to give
[3:15:22.840 --> 3:15:27.480]  thousands of meals to food groups and non-profits just as it
[3:15:27.480 --> 3:15:31.000]  enables alex when you purchase at the infowarstore.com
[3:15:31.000 --> 3:15:35.560]  to reach more people and do awesome things and let's go into the negative
[3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:38.280]  side though right because people always attach
[3:15:38.280 --> 3:15:42.520]  how dare you sell things how dare you have anything to do with money
[3:15:42.520 --> 3:15:46.120]  and it's because of these bad apples like this story today from bloomberg
[3:15:46.120 --> 3:15:50.840]  gm ignition nightmare won't go away for victims or company
[3:15:50.840 --> 3:15:56.440]  gm according to bloomberg knowingly rejected in a ignition fix that would
[3:15:56.440 --> 3:16:02.920]  have cost 90 cents per unit leading to at least 125 deaths
[3:16:02.920 --> 3:16:06.680]  it says the automaker faces first trial out of hundreds of claims the plane
[3:16:06.680 --> 3:16:10.360]  tips want billions of dollars for deaths and injuries
[3:16:10.360 --> 3:16:13.720]  it goes on zachary stevens was a teenager headed to bible study when
[3:16:13.720 --> 3:16:18.440]  his Saturn sky shot across a texan texas highway into a pickup and killed
[3:16:18.440 --> 3:16:22.840]  the driver ruben vasquez 20 died after a drunk
[3:16:22.840 --> 3:16:27.000]  slammed into his stalled chevy cobalt on a california freeway
[3:16:27.000 --> 3:16:30.920]  james yingling the third couldn't break or steer his Saturn ion away from a
[3:16:30.920 --> 3:16:34.600]  culvert in pennsylvania he lingered for 17 days before
[3:16:34.600 --> 3:16:38.680]  dying at 35 these are among the the claims facing
[3:16:38.680 --> 3:16:41.880]  general motors company this year the first of hundreds demanding that gm
[3:16:41.880 --> 3:16:45.560]  pay for the deaths of loved ones or injuries ranging from broken bones to
[3:16:45.560 --> 3:16:48.600]  paralysis the raft of trial scattered across the
[3:16:48.600 --> 3:16:53.080]  country begins monday in federal court this is an example
[3:16:53.080 --> 3:16:56.760]  that i've talked to you about before where a company says
[3:16:56.760 --> 3:16:59.880]  apparently according to according to this bloomberg bloomberg article that's
[3:16:59.880 --> 3:17:06.200]  what gm is doing but a company says hey we could spend 10 cents
[3:17:06.200 --> 3:17:11.000]  to either improve the quality of our food because we know it's linked to
[3:17:11.000 --> 3:17:14.520]  you know causing cancer killing people or birth of x or whatever
[3:17:14.520 --> 3:17:18.600]  or we could pay 90 cents according to bloomberg to fix these
[3:17:18.600 --> 3:17:23.080]  ignition issues but you know what that's 90 cents per unit that we just don't
[3:17:23.080 --> 3:17:26.600]  want to pay and unfortunately this is the decision
[3:17:26.600 --> 3:17:29.640]  they make and they have they have meetings about this and they'll say
[3:17:29.640 --> 3:17:34.440]  well we could pay 90 cents per unit and that would cost x amount let's say that
[3:17:34.440 --> 3:17:39.560]  would cost you know 20 million dollars but we talk to our legal team
[3:17:39.560 --> 3:17:45.240]  and if a few people die it'll only cost 10 million to settle it
[3:17:45.240 --> 3:17:49.240]  it'll only cost 10 million to settle it so why don't we just go ahead and let
[3:17:49.240 --> 3:17:52.920]  those people die and we'll settle it out of court i'm not
[3:17:52.920 --> 3:17:56.840]  saying that's what gm did and i'm saying there's been cases like this
[3:17:56.840 --> 3:18:00.040]  and just in the food example well hey we know
[3:18:00.040 --> 3:18:03.480]  we know that some of this you know could be causing cancer could be
[3:18:03.480 --> 3:18:07.160]  causing birth defects could be kind of killing people right but hey
[3:18:07.160 --> 3:18:11.240]  it's 10 cents it's 10 pence cents per burgers 10 pence 10 cents per
[3:18:11.240 --> 3:18:15.960]  fries that's too much money guys we can't pay that 10 cents let's just settle
[3:18:15.960 --> 3:18:19.720]  out of court and this is where you get that love of
[3:18:19.720 --> 3:18:23.720]  money as opposed to the money itself being evil because when you're so
[3:18:23.720 --> 3:18:28.520]  satisfied with not caring when you've you've gotten rid of your empathy
[3:18:28.520 --> 3:18:32.280]  and you're just on one i'm a starch business man where you can't pay 90
[3:18:32.280 --> 3:18:37.640]  cents to fix something and 125 people die that's lunacy
[3:18:37.640 --> 3:18:42.440]  that is complete lunacy and how about this one
[3:18:42.440 --> 3:18:45.960]  china hospital bulldoze with patients inside and
[3:18:45.960 --> 3:18:50.760]  morgue buried bulldozers unexpectedly demolish part of a hospital and it's
[3:18:50.760 --> 3:18:54.360]  adjoining morgue in central china sending doctors nurses and patients
[3:18:54.360 --> 3:18:59.000]  fleeing and burying under rubble six bodies being processed at the morgue
[3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:02.360]  and this is a whole new crazy china government system
[3:19:02.360 --> 3:19:05.720]  but it just also goes to show some of the madness
[3:19:05.720 --> 3:19:09.720]  and then this one Turkish firm caught selling fake life vests
[3:19:09.720 --> 3:19:14.600]  they soak up water for refugees at sea they soak up water
[3:19:14.600 --> 3:19:18.600]  this is again in profits before people stuff in the chili rough waters
[3:19:18.600 --> 3:19:23.080]  of agon if i'm saying that right tricky under the best of circumstances and
[3:19:23.080 --> 3:19:26.120]  downright treacherous in a flimsy migrant boat a life vest can make the
[3:19:26.120 --> 3:19:29.560]  difference between life and death but for the unlucky refugees who would have
[3:19:29.560 --> 3:19:33.240]  bought roughly 1200 life vests being manufactured in turkey
[3:19:33.240 --> 3:19:37.080]  that was a false promise they sold them life vests this is so
[3:19:37.080 --> 3:19:40.680]  horrible they soak up water and let them die but hey
[3:19:40.680 --> 3:19:44.200]  making a buck can't spend 10 cents to make it real i'm sure
[3:19:44.200 --> 3:19:48.120]  zanthi gochari this is the fourth hour of the alex jon show overdrive will be

[3:24:13.800 --> 3:24:17.240]  according to the hypocrisy playing out in the well connected avenues of
[3:24:17.240 --> 3:24:21.240]  hollywood there are people that were the people that did this to both me and
[3:24:21.240 --> 3:24:24.040]  quarry that are still working they're still out there and
[3:24:24.040 --> 3:24:26.680]  they're some of the richest most powerful people in this business
[3:24:26.680 --> 3:24:30.840]  and the grease palms and happening the shady back rooms of washington dc
[3:24:30.840 --> 3:24:35.320]  being a serial rapist isn't a crime not if your first name is bill
[3:24:35.320 --> 3:24:39.480]  and not if it ends with cosby or clinton of course for the average serial
[3:24:39.480 --> 3:24:42.440]  rapist take one daniel hoitzclaw for instance
[3:24:42.440 --> 3:24:48.920]  hoitzclaw faces 263 years behind bars as he should for 18 counts of raping
[3:24:48.920 --> 3:24:53.160]  women ranging in the ages of 17 to 57 while serving
[3:24:53.160 --> 3:24:57.800]  as an oklahoma police officer is there any difference in the allegations
[3:24:57.800 --> 3:25:01.960]  attached to cosby and clinton beyond the statute of limitations
[3:25:01.960 --> 3:25:05.800]  hoitzclaw used the plight of black females overwhelming fear
[3:25:05.800 --> 3:25:09.000]  that reporting rape guarantees negative results
[3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:12.520]  especially since it was a police officer that committed the rape in the
[3:25:12.520 --> 3:25:15.880]  first place bill cosby a married man allegedly lured
[3:25:15.880 --> 3:25:18.840]  his victims in with his celebrity and then drugged
[3:25:18.840 --> 3:25:22.840]  and raped them while they were passed out according to no less than 45
[3:25:22.840 --> 3:25:26.360]  accusations however the two recent rape allegations that
[3:25:26.360 --> 3:25:29.800]  stuck were thrown out by the la district attorney
[3:25:29.800 --> 3:25:32.920]  resulting in a circus splashed all over mainstream media
[3:25:32.920 --> 3:25:37.000]  with cosby's sad mug replacing his once straight laced
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:40.280]  face of fatherhood bill clinton who continues to dodge
[3:25:40.280 --> 3:25:44.440]  allegations of the rape of wanita broadrick and the sexual assaults of
[3:25:44.440 --> 3:25:49.240]  many others carries on proudly stumping for his wife to be the all-powerful
[3:25:49.240 --> 3:25:54.520]  saul linskyite in chief hillary clinton a woman who's vague illegitimate claim to
[3:25:54.520 --> 3:25:57.960]  being presidential material is her nefarious fumbling of
[3:25:57.960 --> 3:26:01.720]  Benghazi egypt and libya while she was secretary of state
[3:26:01.720 --> 3:26:05.640]  hillary soldiers on for the sake of her new world order handlers
[3:26:05.640 --> 3:26:10.040]  shooting down questions by rape victims while pretending to champion for
[3:26:10.040 --> 3:26:17.320]  women's rights could there be any greater hypocrisy than this
[3:26:22.600 --> 3:26:27.080]  and whether you agree or disagree on what may be dubious charges for the two
[3:26:27.080 --> 3:26:29.640]  bills can we not agree on the fact that a
[3:26:29.640 --> 3:26:33.240]  mushrooming plague of rape is being largely ignored
[3:26:33.240 --> 3:26:36.760]  as rape in the military expands and the media coverage
[3:26:36.760 --> 3:26:40.360]  of the rape of american children by illegal aliens at
[3:26:40.360 --> 3:26:43.720]  unprecedented levels continues to be neglected

[3:27:16.840 --> 3:27:20.200]  you got the good the bad and the ugly like everything else

[3:27:47.640 --> 3:27:51.400]  know it kind of reminds me of something the way that the federal government
[3:27:51.400 --> 3:27:55.720]  handles things is to ignore all of the real stuff
[3:27:55.720 --> 3:27:58.760]  that they need to tell you and all this real stuff that needs to be going on
[3:27:58.760 --> 3:28:02.600]  and tell you some of the most silly possible answers so-called answers

[3:28:26.120 --> 3:28:29.160]  ultimately made no mention of sustainability
[3:28:29.160 --> 3:28:32.840]  the uh they also made no mention of really anything that matters
[3:28:32.840 --> 3:28:37.480]  they said avoid calories from added sugars and saturated fats reduced sodium
[3:28:37.480 --> 3:28:43.480]  intake and to avoid whole milk and it goes on to say all food and beverage
[3:28:43.480 --> 3:28:47.480]  choices matter they took a collective approach to food and health

[3:28:50.760 --> 3:28:53.720]  patterns you guys need to have walking meetings

[3:29:00.200 --> 3:29:03.560]  that is in pretty much every single processed food out there
[3:29:03.560 --> 3:29:07.800]  they don't even talk about the washington post in 2007 how
[3:29:07.800 --> 3:29:11.960]  a third of all processed food contains mercury levels that are super unsafe
[3:29:11.960 --> 3:29:15.160]  mercury that's not even getting into the high fructose corn syrup
[3:29:15.160 --> 3:29:18.440]  which is where the mercury comes from and what that does to you or how
[3:29:18.440 --> 3:29:22.040]  princedin found out that it was a lot different than sugar even though we've
[3:29:22.040 --> 3:29:25.640]  been told it's not over and over again we need to have walking meetings guys
[3:29:25.640 --> 3:29:28.360]  that's the answer forget what you're eating we need to walk around while we

[3:33:32.680 --> 3:33:37.160]  unfold in triplicate spade this is real as it is

[3:34:44.360 --> 3:34:49.240]  raise hell and demand accountability it is the most corrupt
[3:34:49.240 --> 3:34:55.560]  degenerate criminal government in american history
[3:34:55.560 --> 3:34:59.080]  from the front lines of the information war

[3:35:03.640 --> 3:35:07.400]  that was a powerful intro everybody they are going to shoot
[3:35:07.400 --> 3:35:10.440]  if we don't move back their defeat will be
[3:35:10.440 --> 3:35:13.720]  ultimately now we're going to take some calls that was actually a really powerful
[3:35:13.720 --> 3:35:17.400]  intro i'm glad alex stopped in and mentioned that he wanted to play that
[3:35:17.400 --> 3:35:21.480]  we're going to go ahead and talk to paris and delaware he says he's a high
[3:35:21.480 --> 3:35:25.720]  school teacher and wants to talk on all issues what's up paris
[3:35:25.720 --> 3:35:29.080]  today i teach high school health actually and uh
[3:35:29.080 --> 3:35:32.840]  i want you to know i thank you guys so much for what you do i share a lot of
[3:35:32.840 --> 3:35:35.320]  your articles and videos that you have on your
[3:35:35.320 --> 3:35:38.920]  website with my students in class and we've had such an impact
[3:35:38.920 --> 3:35:42.600]  that i actually had doctors call the school to complain because some of my
[3:35:42.600 --> 3:35:46.360]  students were refusing to guard a seal and flu shots
[3:35:46.360 --> 3:35:51.080]  and i inspired an investigation by my school district into what i was doing
[3:35:51.080 --> 3:35:54.920]  and i want you know that i've weathered that and so we really are having an
[3:35:54.920 --> 3:35:58.440]  impact on these kids and their parents as well i speak out at the school board
[3:35:58.440 --> 3:36:01.160]  meetings as well the newspapers have started
[3:36:01.160 --> 3:36:04.680]  started covering it and it's just been a wild ride and
[3:36:04.680 --> 3:36:08.920]  it's all thanks to you guys and there's a lot of me you know out there people
[3:36:08.920 --> 3:36:13.560]  doing these things you know humanity is rising up to meet this challenge
[3:36:13.560 --> 3:36:17.240]  and uh it's i gotta tell you it's just been a lot of fun
[3:36:17.240 --> 3:36:21.720]  and uh i've actually been influenced some of my pharmaceutical rep friends you
[3:36:21.720 --> 3:36:24.680]  know they're they're you know just pulling people out of the matrix
[3:36:24.680 --> 3:36:28.120]  as much as possible and i just want to thank you guys so much for what
[3:36:28.120 --> 3:36:31.480]  for when you guys pulled me out of the matrix several years ago
[3:36:31.480 --> 3:36:34.840]  well the real people making a difference are people like you that are teaching
[3:36:34.840 --> 3:36:37.640]  children you know think for themselves and
[3:36:37.640 --> 3:36:42.280]  actually helping them in many ways i think with the whole medical system and
[3:36:42.280 --> 3:36:45.800]  really anything there's nothing wrong with questioning
[3:36:45.800 --> 3:36:48.840]  right there's nothing wrong with presenting alternative information
[3:36:48.840 --> 3:36:52.840]  what is scary is when people freak out and try to stop you from presenting the
[3:36:52.840 --> 3:36:56.360]  alternative view right so it's fine in the medical
[3:36:56.360 --> 3:36:59.640]  system has you know if you're in a car accident you need surgery you're not
[3:36:59.640 --> 3:37:04.120]  going to take herbs and recover if your arm is
[3:37:04.120 --> 3:37:07.000]  you know cut off and you're bleeding everywhere you have to go to a hospital
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:10.360]  and get surgery the medical system has many benefits
[3:37:10.360 --> 3:37:14.040]  you know the establishment system right it's just where they start
[3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:16.840]  turning it into the overlord system where they
[3:37:16.840 --> 3:37:20.120]  are everything and there's no such thing as prevention
[3:37:20.120 --> 3:37:23.960]  but thankfully you know you being an example as well i also know several
[3:37:23.960 --> 3:37:26.920]  mds that own major health institutions
[3:37:26.920 --> 3:37:30.680]  that are 100 saying hey wait a minute maybe number one we shouldn't be
[3:37:30.680 --> 3:37:34.840]  charging $100 for a bag of saline that costs
[3:37:34.840 --> 3:37:37.960]  less than one cent right maybe we shouldn't be doing that
[3:37:37.960 --> 3:37:41.080]  maybe we shouldn't be over prescribing drugs to all these people and they don't
[3:37:41.080 --> 3:37:45.640]  need them and maybe we should look at prevention
[3:37:45.640 --> 3:37:50.120]  instead of just giving everyone surgery and prescribing pharmaceutical drugs
[3:37:50.120 --> 3:37:53.400]  with known side effects when the pharmaceutical companies are willing to
[3:37:53.400 --> 3:37:55.880]  settle lawsuits kind of like we talked about earlier
[3:37:55.880 --> 3:37:59.640]  instead of actually upgrade and fix their product
[3:37:59.640 --> 3:38:05.000]  right so it doesn't even matter what you choose to do as long as you present
[3:38:05.000 --> 3:38:08.360]  the alternative information as long as you say hey there's at least an option
[3:38:08.360 --> 3:38:11.320]  if you want to vaccinate that's fine but here's some of the information that
[3:38:11.320 --> 3:38:14.600]  you might want to look at right that's my view and when you can't do that
[3:38:14.600 --> 3:38:17.160]  that's when there's a huge issue when they won't even let you
[3:38:17.160 --> 3:38:21.880]  present an alternative viewpoint that is when it's really really scary
[3:38:21.880 --> 3:38:29.000]  let's go to let's go to christopher in california what's on your mind
[3:38:31.480 --> 3:38:35.480]  dress you there all right we'll have to jump to the next caller

[3:39:12.600 --> 3:39:16.840]  uh president obama's little speech and one of the things that just really
[3:39:16.840 --> 3:39:20.920]  irked me was that he was saying and let me
[3:39:20.920 --> 3:39:24.520]  get over to my twitter account real quick he said that
[3:39:24.520 --> 3:39:28.600]  he believes in the second amendment then he turns around and says
[3:39:28.600 --> 3:39:32.440]  it's on the paper and it's the way he says it it's
[3:39:32.440 --> 3:39:36.680]  it's on the it's on the paper and it's like well
[3:39:36.680 --> 3:39:39.800]  wait a minute he's talking about the bill of rights it's on the paper
[3:39:39.800 --> 3:39:43.000]  this is a president talking about our bill of rights
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:47.640]  being a piece of paper so that kind of really made me
[3:39:47.640 --> 3:39:51.400]  totally livid to see him that and the way that he said it
[3:39:51.400 --> 3:39:55.560]  it's totally disrespectful to the bill of rights totally disrespectful to the
[3:39:55.560 --> 3:39:58.920]  constitution but given to the fact of what i've seen
[3:39:58.920 --> 3:40:03.800]  so far on today's show it's no wonder but you know how do you wake up these
[3:40:03.800 --> 3:40:08.360]  people to see you know get them to see that hey this guy
[3:40:08.360 --> 3:40:13.640]  is nothing more than a trojan horse you know i'll share my story
[3:40:13.640 --> 3:40:17.320]  if anyone in the world would probably be a tough
[3:40:17.320 --> 3:40:21.240]  candidate to see the truth about you know the second amendment and guns and
[3:40:21.240 --> 3:40:25.000]  everything it would have been me right i'm growing up on the east coast
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:30.360]  in philadelphia in the city where no one has a gun if you even talk about guns
[3:40:30.360 --> 3:40:33.480]  how oh my a gun what you know you're crazy
[3:40:33.480 --> 3:40:38.200]  and everyone on television is talking about gun crime and only the most
[3:40:38.200 --> 3:40:42.120]  terrible people and gangs are having guns and these drive-by shootings guns are
[3:40:42.120 --> 3:40:45.080]  scary man why would you ever want one of those right the whole
[3:40:45.080 --> 3:40:48.600]  east coast downtown mentality you have to get a permit like you have to be
[3:40:48.600 --> 3:40:51.880]  carrying cash if you're even going to have a pistol and even then it's hard to
[3:40:51.880 --> 3:40:56.280]  get one i was 100 convinced you know when i
[3:40:56.280 --> 3:40:59.480]  was much younger that guns were horrible i mean what
[3:40:59.480 --> 3:41:02.920]  why have them we should just get rid of them right of course this is when i was
[3:41:02.920 --> 3:41:06.440]  a kid just watching them the news and stuff no one told me
[3:41:06.440 --> 3:41:10.680]  but then when i did my own research into it i made a two hour video about this
[3:41:10.680 --> 3:41:13.800]  actually this is part of what i was talking
[3:41:13.800 --> 3:41:16.920]  about earlier you're not allowed to talk about this stuff though
[3:41:16.920 --> 3:41:20.680]  because here's the most amazing thing i'm not even telling you what to think
[3:41:20.680 --> 3:41:24.600]  i'm just going to talk about some statistics the fbi crime statistics
[3:41:24.600 --> 3:41:27.000]  that obama does not want to talk about nobody does
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:30.360]  where you look at how many people are actually killed by rifles and then you
[3:41:30.360 --> 3:41:32.840]  look at how many are killed by handguns and then you look at that
[3:41:32.840 --> 3:41:36.680]  say well how many of those were self-defense wow this is a shockingly
[3:41:36.680 --> 3:41:41.000]  large number right the rifle deaths especially are super super low
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:44.280]  no one actually is going out and killing with a rifle
[3:41:44.280 --> 3:41:47.960]  in most cases unless it's in self-defense they're
[3:41:47.960 --> 3:41:50.760]  you know at their house or something people don't use rifles to go out and
[3:41:50.760 --> 3:41:54.600]  kill people then you say well hmm of all of these
[3:41:54.600 --> 3:41:59.720]  how many deaths were estimated to be prevented though from the use of a gun
[3:41:59.720 --> 3:42:03.000]  either shooting or not even shooting it just having it out
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:07.800]  and then it's like 800,000 you say wow these are really interesting statistics
[3:42:07.800 --> 3:42:12.120]  and then even talking to some of my most quote unquote liberal friends
[3:42:12.120 --> 3:42:15.720]  they're like yeah i own a gun you know i have a couple pistols in the house and
[3:42:15.720 --> 3:42:19.240]  a rifle or whatever and i think it's a great idea
[3:42:19.240 --> 3:42:23.560]  and i say well where is this this mantra of banning all guns coming from
[3:42:23.560 --> 3:42:26.600]  oh wait it's coming from nowhere it's the mainstream media once again
[3:42:26.600 --> 3:42:30.200]  controlling the narrative acting like we all agree acting like
[3:42:30.200 --> 3:42:33.720]  come on what are you a redneck what are you a some type of redneck
[3:42:33.720 --> 3:42:38.520]  we need to just ban them all man just ban them all so the answer to your question
[3:42:38.520 --> 3:42:42.760]  and say you're asking how to wake people up i think most of them already get it
[3:42:42.760 --> 3:42:45.960]  but just look at me you know i'm some city slicker
[3:42:45.960 --> 3:42:50.600]  you know fool from downtown Philadelphia that somehow figured it out
[3:42:50.600 --> 3:42:53.640]  because i looked at the information show them the FBI statistics
[3:42:53.640 --> 3:42:56.440]  and don't tell people what to think is there is they don't say well they're good
[3:42:56.440 --> 3:42:58.680]  because blah blah say hey look at the numbers
[3:42:58.680 --> 3:43:02.840]  look at the numbers because you notice no one in the mainstream
[3:43:02.840 --> 3:43:06.360]  Obama they don't want to talk about the actual numbers i think that pretty much
[3:43:06.360 --> 3:43:09.960]  proves the point to most people let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Wyoming
[3:43:09.960 --> 3:43:13.560]  how's it going Tim good good Anthony thanks for taking
[3:43:13.560 --> 3:43:16.360]  my call i appreciate it well thanks for calling in
[3:43:16.360 --> 3:43:18.920]  happy new year appreciate it thank you thank you
[3:43:18.920 --> 3:43:22.760]  well the question i have actually not a question a comment i wanted to talk
[3:43:22.760 --> 3:43:26.040]  about bitcoin because alex was speaking with one of his
[3:43:26.040 --> 3:43:28.840]  guests which are whose name i can't remember i think it was
[3:43:28.840 --> 3:43:32.520]  was a mollinue no somebody else i can't remember who it was but
[3:43:32.520 --> 3:43:35.480]  is one of his guests was speaking about bitcoin
[3:43:35.480 --> 3:43:39.640]  and i was wondering how long will it be this this is the one question i have but
[3:43:39.640 --> 3:43:45.160]  how um how long will it be before uh info wars or alexjones.com
[3:43:45.160 --> 3:43:50.200]  or or uh prisonplanet.com or any any of the uh
[3:43:50.200 --> 3:43:56.280]  free speech systems companies alex jones's companies will accept bitcoin for payment
[3:43:56.280 --> 3:43:59.400]  well actually i'm pretty sure no i'm pretty sure unless something changed
[3:43:59.400 --> 3:44:02.760]  that info war store does accept bitcoin actually i'm pretty sure you can use
[3:44:02.760 --> 3:44:06.600]  bitwall yeah info war store 99.9% sure maybe someone back
[3:44:06.600 --> 3:44:10.200]  there can confirm it's still happening it does actually support bitcoin all of
[3:44:10.200 --> 3:44:14.600]  alex's stores do as far as i'm aware so i think the uh
[3:44:14.600 --> 3:44:17.880]  i was gonna say hey you have to ask alex about but then you want further i'm
[3:44:17.880 --> 3:44:22.680]  pretty sure we actually do accept that so feel free independent currency alex is
[3:44:22.680 --> 3:44:26.040]  all about it great great because last time i checked
[3:44:26.040 --> 3:44:29.480]  i think uh one one single bitcoin was something like
[3:44:29.480 --> 3:44:33.960]  i think it was four hundred dollars yeah four yeah around four something
[3:44:33.960 --> 3:44:40.120]  used to be about 1200 right right and um i i think i remember the
[3:44:40.120 --> 3:44:43.800]  one of the guests was saying something about having gone to
[3:44:43.800 --> 3:44:48.600]  having gone to the uh one of the first bitcoin forums or something
[3:44:48.600 --> 3:44:52.280]  maybe it was yes maybe it was someone else anyway um but he was saying
[3:44:52.280 --> 3:44:55.560]  something about how it was it was a dollar three dollars three
[3:44:55.560 --> 3:44:59.320]  dollars a bitcoin which was no exactly i have a story like that too i don't
[3:44:59.320 --> 3:45:03.640]  remember if it was in what year it was 2008 2007 or whatever
[3:45:03.640 --> 3:45:06.600]  but people were just kind of giving them away they're buying video games with
[3:45:06.600 --> 3:45:09.720]  them and they were pretty much worthless at that point like you're
[3:45:09.720 --> 3:45:13.480]  saying and people will just have them and i remember someone explaining it to me
[3:45:13.480 --> 3:45:16.200]  and because they didn't explain it to me too well and i didn't really look into
[3:45:16.200 --> 3:45:19.080]  it it sounded like a total you know low to bs
[3:45:19.080 --> 3:45:22.360]  they were like yeah well there's just these coins and they're like digital
[3:45:22.360 --> 3:45:26.040]  and you can just buy stuff with them like you could buy you know like
[3:45:26.040 --> 3:45:29.560]  doodads and stuff and i was like what's it based on you know i was like what
[3:45:29.560 --> 3:45:32.600]  what is it based on how does it have any value they're like well it's based on
[3:45:32.600 --> 3:45:35.320]  nothing it's just an online currency i'm like well
[3:45:35.320 --> 3:45:38.520]  you know how do you how do you hold it how do you do all that you know and he
[3:45:38.520 --> 3:45:41.320]  goes well you don't it's just it's just kind of like there it's just a
[3:45:41.320 --> 3:45:45.000]  digital currency sounds like a load of crap i don't want any of
[3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:48.360]  that but then of course right if i actually knew
[3:45:48.360 --> 3:45:50.920]  how it worked back then i would understand a bit more
[3:45:50.920 --> 3:45:54.200]  but at the time people were just giving them away they were they were trading
[3:45:54.200 --> 3:45:57.880]  like hundreds of them for video games online
[3:45:57.880 --> 3:46:01.880]  or donating them to other people because it was kind of just like this weird
[3:46:01.880 --> 3:46:06.040]  digital currency and i know people that had a bunch of them back in the day
[3:46:06.040 --> 3:46:09.000]  and they don't remember how to access them they had hundreds of them on their
[3:46:09.000 --> 3:46:12.280]  account and to you know this day they don't know how to access them
[3:46:12.280 --> 3:46:14.920]  and i know some people also that sold them when they were at like 30 bucks and
[3:46:14.920 --> 3:46:17.640]  they thought they made a huge bunch of money made like you know a few hundred
[3:46:17.640 --> 3:46:19.480]  dollars oh my god i made a few hundred dollars
[3:46:19.480 --> 3:46:23.480]  and then it goes up to 1200 dollars so yeah bitcoin is very interesting but
[3:46:23.480 --> 3:46:27.800]  i'm pretty sure you can use bitcoins at infowarstore.com and infowarslife.com

[3:47:37.400 --> 3:47:40.600]  all right we're going to go to anthony in florida
[3:47:40.600 --> 3:47:44.120]  how are you doing what's on your mind hello
[3:47:44.120 --> 3:47:49.560]  yes um i'd like to talk about the um what do you call it the the political
[3:47:49.560 --> 3:47:52.680]  correctness the mental illness that is political correctness that has
[3:47:52.680 --> 3:47:55.640]  infiltrated the colleges right on go ahead can't help
[3:47:55.640 --> 3:47:59.480]  yeah and i can't help to notice how this is this is right out of the
[3:47:59.480 --> 3:48:04.200]  this is right out this is right out of the 1960s cultural revolution in china
[3:48:04.200 --> 3:48:07.880]  where basically the government has totally brainwashed the young people
[3:48:07.880 --> 3:48:12.200]  and uh and they're basically um we call rejecting their culture and their
[3:48:12.200 --> 3:48:15.320]  heritage and i couldn't help to notice too
[3:48:15.320 --> 3:48:18.280]  especially at Yale when that one student
[3:48:18.280 --> 3:48:21.960]  she you know you listen to it it's it's like she was literally
[3:48:21.960 --> 3:48:26.520]  whining about something that is just totally irrelevant
[3:48:26.520 --> 3:48:30.840]  and i couldn't you know what i'm saying yeah and so
[3:48:30.840 --> 3:48:34.440]  i just like to i just like to elaborate a little bit about that too no political
[3:48:34.440 --> 3:48:37.800]  correctness is total verbal domination i've said it here before i've
[3:48:37.800 --> 3:48:43.240]  explained it to you before it is 100 percent
[3:48:43.240 --> 3:48:46.600]  thought domination because if i say something and
[3:48:46.600 --> 3:48:50.200]  anyone can now make anything offensive right so if i say something
[3:48:50.200 --> 3:48:54.520]  wow i like your dress oh my god right you can instantly call me a sexist or
[3:48:54.520 --> 3:48:58.280]  racist whatever you want you therefore are controlling me and
[3:48:58.280 --> 3:49:02.840]  dominating me by socially accepted speech patterns so socially accepted
[3:49:02.840 --> 3:49:06.840]  um political correctness right so it is a form of
[3:49:06.840 --> 3:49:10.680]  weaponry of ideological and verbal weaponry that can be used and deployed
[3:49:10.680 --> 3:49:14.360]  at any time with the full backing of the establishment
[3:49:14.360 --> 3:49:18.120]  this has never happened before in the united states the establishment now
[3:49:18.120 --> 3:49:21.480]  has a weapon system an ideological weapon system
[3:49:21.480 --> 3:49:25.960]  that its own followers are deploying so as i agree with you
[3:49:25.960 --> 3:49:28.760]  it's in the colleges it's not just young people though i mean you can talk to
[3:49:28.760 --> 3:49:32.120]  anyone of all walks of life and they will deploy this weapon system
[3:49:32.120 --> 3:49:35.000]  they will take out their bazooka gun of political correctness
[3:49:35.000 --> 3:49:38.360]  and blow you away if you let them and i've seen it happen
[3:49:38.360 --> 3:49:41.720]  i've actually been out and someone said something to this
[3:49:41.720 --> 3:49:45.480]  you know college age girl and it wasn't it wasn't it was nothing it was
[3:49:45.480 --> 3:49:49.160]  seriously a silly little funny joke he was actually trying to be nice
[3:49:49.160 --> 3:49:53.320]  and the girl my god and started freaking out and crying told me it's such a
[3:49:53.320 --> 3:49:56.840]  sexist jerk and all this kind of stuff and the problem is
[3:49:56.840 --> 3:50:00.440]  when you let these people dominate you like that and you say oh i'm so sorry i
[3:50:00.440 --> 3:50:04.040]  didn't mean anything like that please you're playing into the system
[3:50:04.040 --> 3:50:07.000]  and you lose the game when you play the game because they run the game
[3:50:07.000 --> 3:50:12.040]  the political correctness system is a game and when you play you lose
[3:50:12.040 --> 3:50:15.320]  the answer is not to play the game because you know you're a good person
[3:50:15.320 --> 3:50:18.200]  you know you actually care about people you know you're not racist you know
[3:50:18.200 --> 3:50:21.480]  you're not sexist you're not going to play the game man
[3:50:21.480 --> 3:50:24.520]  i'm not going to play it i'm not going to be dominated by it when someone tries
[3:50:24.520 --> 3:50:27.080]  to dominate me with political correctness

[3:57:48.840 --> 3:57:53.400]  it's an example in a lot of ways of what we used to have you know years and
[3:57:53.400 --> 3:57:56.920]  years ago where families actually come together and they eat together and they
[3:57:56.920 --> 3:57:59.640]  go out and they pick berries as she was saying and do all these really really
[3:57:59.640 --> 3:58:02.840]  fun things and it is a shame that the federal government of course just has
[3:58:02.840 --> 3:58:05.240]  to crush over and over again all the things that are
[3:58:05.240 --> 3:58:08.760]  wholesome and good in many different ways well thanks so much for watching
