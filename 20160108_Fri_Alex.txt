[00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:06.147]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.147 --> 00:00:07.908]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:09.668]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.668 --> 00:00:11.248]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.248 --> 00:00:12.788]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:16.989]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:23.771]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.771 --> 00:00:31.432]  It only intensifies the fallout assault of global government, consolidation of the people of the planet.
[00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:39.463]  Squealing amounts of incredible information dizzy the mind.
[00:00:39.463 --> 00:00:53.272]  Great awakenings are happening, but also at the cost of great loss of freedom as the gloves are taken off and the tyrannical social engineers of the planetary regime sink their teeth into the bones.
[00:00:53.272 --> 00:01:01.297]  They've already chewed into our flesh, now they're getting into the bones of the very system that sustains humanity on this planet.
[00:01:01.297 --> 00:01:01.557]  Wow!
[00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.396]  I did not watch the Obama speech yesterday on CNN, the whole town hall, until my children had gone to bed.
[00:01:10.396 --> 00:01:22.327]  Then I went online and watched it and backed it up and re-watched it and began sending lists to Nico, the great producer, to collate with Richard and others today.
[00:01:22.327 --> 00:01:25.871]  And we have at least 12 clips we're going to play.
[00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:32.337]  Every one of them is an over-the-top, massive deception.
[00:01:32.337 --> 00:01:35.399]  Obama says, nobody wants your guns.
[00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.540]  Nobody.
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.321]  And 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:42.542]  Nobody's coming for your guns.
[00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:44.603]  Nobody's ever come for your guns.
[00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:52.547]  America was founded in paranoia, basically, of imaginary enemies.
[00:01:52.547 --> 00:01:53.287]  It was incredible.
[00:01:54.994 --> 00:02:02.083]  The one thing that might have been truthful in there was this establishment alien.
[00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:07.590]  That's what my buddy Anthony Gucciardi calls people that have been raised by wealthy families and
[00:02:09.835 --> 00:02:15.358]  Insulated for so long, white, black, it doesn't matter, that they just don't know how the real world works.
[00:02:15.358 --> 00:02:22.242]  It's like George Herbert Walker Bush, 10 years after scanners were ubiquitous, walking through a grocery store and saying, what's this?
[00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.964]  What was it, ABC Nightly News?
[00:02:23.964 --> 00:02:25.404]  What's that?
[00:02:25.404 --> 00:02:26.965]  I've never seen one of those.
[00:02:26.965 --> 00:02:28.886]  Been around for 20 years at that time.
[00:02:28.886 --> 00:02:32.989]  Been ubiquitous for a decade.
[00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:33.609]  What is it, like 1990?
[00:02:35.407 --> 00:02:43.563]  Didn't know what a checkout barcode laser scanner was.
[00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.947]  I'll assure you he knows what a planetary government is.
[00:02:48.823 --> 00:02:52.484]  Obama said, I've never owned a gun, never been around them.
[00:02:52.484 --> 00:02:54.785]  But you're guarded by thousands of them.
[00:02:54.785 --> 00:03:00.147]  And Stinger missiles on top of the roof of the White House from hijacked jet airliners.
[00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:05.269]  And you're guarded by hundreds of thousands of men and women with guns that defend the country.
[00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.969]  But you've never had one.
[00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.250]  And that's the problem with a Max Keiser or a Barack Obama.
[00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.671]  And I like Max.
[00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:15.912]  But he's from, you know, New York, Connecticut, never been around guns, never shot them.
[00:03:15.912 --> 00:03:18.033]  They literally are like space aliens.
[00:03:20.063 --> 00:03:23.986]  And I'm kind of like a space alien compared to my dad.
[00:03:23.986 --> 00:03:33.252]  My dad knows how to fix pretty much any engine, parts, electrical, farming, carpentry, metallurgy, he can blacksmith.
[00:03:33.252 --> 00:03:42.298]  It's like he's an elf who belongs in Santa Claus's workshop.
[00:03:42.298 --> 00:03:46.440]  And his father was even better.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.661]  Now?
[00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:52.188]  Compared to most men, I know how to change a tire, work on a few things here and there.
[00:03:52.188 --> 00:04:01.335]  I know how to, you know, drive nails on a roof of a house, but I am a gibbering moron.
[00:04:01.335 --> 00:04:08.360]  I am mentally retarded when it comes to technical things and building things compared to my father.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.245]  I mean, my dad can snake a toilet, my dad can put in pipes, my dad can put in floors, my dad can do... you name it, he can do it.
[00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:17.386]  And do it fast.
[00:04:17.386 --> 00:04:23.529]  I had like an R2-D2 robot when I was like 12 that broke and he got in it and soldered it in like an hour and got it working again.
[00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:24.790]  I mean, you don't see that.
[00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:42.459]  And then you, and then I was downtown yesterday taking care of business and I looked at people, black, white, old, young, they look like soft moron zombies and they don't know how to do anything but watch CNN and hear about how evil guns are despite the fact that gun crime's down 60 plus percent since 1992.
[00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:43.520]  Just department owned numbers.
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:51.285]  That's really the crisis we face, that even the establishment vampires are these inept morons.
[00:04:51.285 --> 00:04:54.327]  I mean, I was 10 years old, could shoot bullseye at 300 yards.
[00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:56.028]  Obama doesn't even know how to wipe his rear end.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.507]  The Obama administration is pushing for the largest gun grab in American history.
[00:05:05.507 --> 00:05:09.751]  We're also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient.
[00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:13.695]  And we're going to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century.
[00:05:13.695 --> 00:05:18.000]  Anyone critical of the government could have their Second Amendment rights taken away.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:34.329]  Simply if psychologists diagnose them with what they are calling oppositional defiant disorder, which the American Psychiatric Association describes as a defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior toward authority.
[00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:42.414]  Other measures will allow doctors to report patients to the FBI and RFID tracking with smart guns.
[00:05:42.414 --> 00:05:44.095]  We're gonna boost gun safety technology.
[00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:47.616]  We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer.
[00:05:47.616 --> 00:05:53.119]  We can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you got the right fingerprint.
[00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:54.979]  Why can't we do the same thing for our guns?
[00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.741]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.

[00:06:58.706 --> 00:07:05.612]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered 6 months free at Christmas.
[00:07:05.612 --> 00:07:08.495]  We've always offered 5 months free.
[00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:14.441]  But since I announced 6 free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:17.844]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.

[00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:09.741]  We are on the march.
[00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:12.905]  The empire is on the run.
[00:08:12.905 --> 00:08:18.232]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.232 --> 00:08:25.100]  Well, I hope you're strapped in, because the great quickening is upon us.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.123]  World governments being openly announced.
[00:08:28.493 --> 00:08:45.638]  Globalist proxy armies are funding right-wing Nazi organizations in Ukraine, hardcore Wahhabist psycho killers in the Middle East, and other systems worldwide to bring down sovereign nations here in the United States and Western Europe.
[00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.953]  The family and basic institutions are under assault.
[00:08:50.953 --> 00:08:54.475]  The free market is being overthrown for crony capitalism.
[00:08:54.475 --> 00:09:03.781]  Socialism and communism are being promoted to the grassroots to complete their journey to domestication and walrus-like helplessness.
[00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:10.785]  The battle is here.
[00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:13.026]  Stock markets around the world are plunging.
[00:09:13.026 --> 00:09:15.368]  You can see in live time if you go to Drudge Report.
[00:09:16.528 --> 00:09:37.802]  That it began plunging massively this morning, and then at about 11 o'clock Eastern, they began to pump it up with the admitted President's Committee on Open Markets of the Plunge Protection Team, which they even denied was manipulating markets until a few years ago.
[00:09:37.802 --> 00:09:41.024]  They admit they began pumping the market up yesterday as well.
[00:09:41.024 --> 00:09:42.205]  It wasn't a quote glitch.
[00:09:43.578 --> 00:09:47.724]  Remember last year they had those quote glitches, they now admit those were not glitches.
[00:09:47.724 --> 00:09:54.394]  Just to show how they lie to us out of hand.
[00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:56.157]  We're going to be breaking all of that down.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.262]  Earthquake in Oklahoma raises fears of a big one.
[00:10:01.262 --> 00:10:02.844]  New York Times.
[00:10:02.844 --> 00:10:04.585]  Donald Trump's big tent.
[00:10:04.585 --> 00:10:07.507]  Politico says the GOP should not be fooling itself.
[00:10:07.507 --> 00:10:11.370]  Trump is reaching more than just undereducated angry white men.
[00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.451]  Uh, yeah.
[00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:15.454]  Louis Farrakhan, and I'm going to air the interview soon.
[00:10:15.454 --> 00:10:20.598]  It'll be at least next week because it's two hours long and we've got to put it all together.
[00:10:20.598 --> 00:10:21.679]  Basically likes Trump.
[00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:24.521]  I mean, it's just, it's over the top, people.
[00:10:26.575 --> 00:10:30.057]  It's just transcending race, religion, all of it.
[00:10:30.057 --> 00:10:33.400]  People are sick of the establishment.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:42.567]  And Farrakhan agrees that they're bringing radical Muslims in from Syria that are war fighters that are going to attack, and it's going to be used to bring in martial law in America.
[00:10:44.386 --> 00:10:48.308]  And he's been told they've got a grand jury convening in Chicago secretly.
[00:10:48.308 --> 00:10:49.348]  This is breaking.
[00:10:49.348 --> 00:10:52.390]  And that when this all kicks off, they're going to arrest him and others.
[00:10:52.390 --> 00:11:01.294]  Which, by the way, is in the COG plan to not just go after black nationalist leaders, but also liberty leaders.
[00:11:01.294 --> 00:11:07.577]  And by the way, the president specifically responded to Infowars last night.
[00:11:07.577 --> 00:11:13.300]  The White House has responded to us by name before on power plant shutdowns, and they've had their surrogates attack us on a daily basis.
[00:11:14.502 --> 00:11:17.065]  Organizations run by the White House like Media Matters and others.
[00:11:17.065 --> 00:11:21.309]  I mean, it's no secret that we're one of the main targets in America now.
[00:11:21.309 --> 00:11:22.611]  Limbaugh's kind of receded.
[00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:26.315]  It's mainly Matt Drudge, Alex Jones.
[00:11:26.315 --> 00:11:27.636]  Glenn Beck has receded.
[00:11:27.636 --> 00:11:31.120]  It's Matt Drudge, Alex Jones, because we're the people reaching the big numbers.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.625]  I mean, you said you don't want to go to that website, you know, that says that
[00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:40.986]  Register, confiscate, tyranny.
[00:11:40.986 --> 00:11:44.249]  First comes registration, then comes confiscation, then comes tyranny.
[00:11:44.249 --> 00:11:48.232]  That is an Alex Jones maxim of 20 years.
[00:11:48.232 --> 00:11:49.693]  You can pull the clips up all day.
[00:11:49.693 --> 00:11:56.279]  I mean, they are directly responding with a straight face that, oh, there are no death panels in Obamacare.
[00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:57.540]  Here's the subsection.
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.062]  After it passes, they go, of course there are death panels.
[00:12:00.062 --> 00:12:01.123]  Oh, you can keep your doctor.
[00:12:01.123 --> 00:12:04.266]  Really says you can.
[00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:05.166]  Oh, you said it's free.
[00:12:05.166 --> 00:12:05.667]  No, it's not.
[00:12:07.418 --> 00:12:11.459]  So Obama responds to the, quote, conspiracy theories.
[00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:13.319]  We're going to be getting into all that.
[00:12:13.319 --> 00:12:22.901]  We're learning more about what's happening in Europe, and it's worse than we even thought.
[00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:27.502]  We're going to be getting into the massive rape epidemic taking place.
[00:12:27.502 --> 00:12:31.963]  But getting back to Obama, there are so many angles to this.
[00:12:35.956 --> 00:12:39.399]  And I'm going to just start with these clips and go through them.
[00:12:39.399 --> 00:12:43.383]  First we're going to play Obama saying he's never owned a gun.
[00:12:43.383 --> 00:12:46.926]  Because through this interview, you can understand everything.
[00:12:46.926 --> 00:12:53.071]  Then he goes on and says that there is no plot or conspiracy to take your guns.
[00:12:53.071 --> 00:12:56.875]  No, just every city the Democrats run, they have total gun ban.
[00:12:56.875 --> 00:12:58.036]  Chicago, New York, D.C.
[00:13:00.882 --> 00:13:06.428]  Couple hundred people have concealed carries or whatever that you get from the government in New York if you're part of the establishment.
[00:13:06.428 --> 00:13:10.071]  I mean, essentially there's 18 million people and a couple hundred can carry guns.
[00:13:10.071 --> 00:13:15.297]  And Bloomberg's got like 15 armed guards on video when he walks around, pulling guns out on people.
[00:13:15.297 --> 00:13:16.318]  But you can't have one.
[00:13:16.318 --> 00:13:18.380]  I mean, ridiculous hypocrisy.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.783]  Then we've got Obama saying guns should be safe like everything else.
[00:13:25.783 --> 00:13:26.804]  Smart guns.
[00:13:26.804 --> 00:13:35.470]  And I saw Fox News this morning on two different shows, while I was exercising, saying the talking point, well, conservatives agree we should have smart guns.
[00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.731]  Let's not debate that.
[00:13:36.731 --> 00:13:39.633]  So the new talking point is, we agree to smart guns.
[00:13:39.633 --> 00:13:41.415]  They'll ban all the previous guns.
[00:13:41.415 --> 00:13:44.417]  They'll be able to neutralize and turn off all the new ones.
[00:13:44.417 --> 00:13:46.499]  They admit micro-stamping
[00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:48.240]  Registration.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.762]  All of this is to ban the old guns and then pick up the new guns later.
[00:13:51.762 --> 00:13:57.766]  I mean, I have the mayor of Proteum in Austin laughing at a gun rally and saying, you're sighing about confiscation?
[00:13:57.766 --> 00:13:58.927]  That's not happening yet.
[00:13:58.927 --> 00:14:00.969]  Once we register, then we get them.
[00:14:00.969 --> 00:14:03.110]  First we do this, which was registration.
[00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.770]  State of Texas.
[00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:04.771]  We shot it down.
[00:14:04.771 --> 00:14:05.772]  Bloomberg financed it.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:12.243]  You shot it down, the governor shot it down, and they just sit there and go, we will get your guns.
[00:14:12.243 --> 00:14:27.914]  I mean, I've seen the Violence Policy Center in the front page of the Austin American-Statesman in 2000 when I caught bribery on video at the Capitol and there was a criminal investigation and it derailed the whole group of gun control laws over it.
[00:14:27.914 --> 00:14:36.941]  And they actually said in the paper, it doesn't matter what Mr. Jones does, we have your children in the public schools and are educating them and we will ban guns within the next generation.
[00:14:37.952 --> 00:14:46.225]  It was a quote of the head of the Violence Policy Center in the front of the paper saying, we will get your guns!
[00:14:47.612 --> 00:14:56.600]  And they've got Salon and Newsweek and Daily Beast and all these other groups saying, no, we need to go ahead and just take the guns.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.662]  Yes, it's about confiscating them.
[00:14:58.662 --> 00:15:01.884]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:15:01.884 --> 00:15:03.566]  That's Dianne Feinstein.
[00:15:03.566 --> 00:15:08.110]  And Obama just gets up there like he can triumph over reality with his BS.
[00:15:10.615 --> 00:15:13.797]  And say, nobody wants your guns.
[00:15:13.797 --> 00:15:23.922]  I know America was founded by people who were paranoid of a foreign power, England, but... Like, that's stupid, too.
[00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:29.944]  No, the British were here raping, robbing, stealing, not letting anybody have businesses unless they paid giant taxes.
[00:15:29.944 --> 00:15:33.826]  You had to be connected to royalty to get licenses for businesses.
[00:15:33.826 --> 00:15:36.928]  That's the real reason George Washington wanted war.
[00:15:36.928 --> 00:15:39.069]  Because he was a second-class citizen in business.
[00:15:43.001 --> 00:15:46.762]  Boy, if he didn't like being discriminated against, imagine how black people feel a hundred times worse.
[00:15:46.762 --> 00:15:48.662]  I mean, I get their grievances.
[00:15:48.662 --> 00:15:50.903]  But that's what it was really all about.
[00:15:50.903 --> 00:15:59.325]  And the British would grab colonial children when they'd stop press kings in the UK, in England, because of riots.
[00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:02.106]  They'd stop press kings in Scotland, England, and Ireland.
[00:16:03.527 --> 00:16:11.274]  They'd come into your town, sometimes a hundred miles inland, and the government would grab your six, seven, eight, nine-year-old and bring them as slaves onto the ships.
[00:16:11.274 --> 00:16:15.498]  They'd be gone basically forever.
[00:16:15.498 --> 00:16:17.260]  No judge, no jury, no law.
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.421]  Press gangs.
[00:16:18.421 --> 00:16:20.643]  Slavery.
[00:16:20.643 --> 00:16:23.966]  On average, you wouldn't survive two or three missions.
[00:16:23.966 --> 00:16:26.449]  A lot of those shipping missions had a third casualties.
[00:16:27.452 --> 00:16:35.857]  They would come take your kids, and they came and were enslaving the colonies, and that was another big reason, was impressment.
[00:16:35.857 --> 00:16:37.338]  Impressment.
[00:16:37.338 --> 00:16:41.220]  You don't get taught about that in school because only black people were slaves.
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:52.507]  Because we want to make them have an identity complex and feel bad so the Democrats, the actual progenitors of the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazis, can perch on top of them and control them and abort them and dumb them down.
[00:16:53.578 --> 00:16:55.619]  This is just all the facts being laid out here.
[00:16:55.619 --> 00:17:00.682]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen, it goes on.
[00:17:00.682 --> 00:17:07.206]  The one good shining ray was Chris Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle.
[00:17:07.206 --> 00:17:08.867]  And I just can't help but love her.
[00:17:08.867 --> 00:17:11.049]  I mean, she's telling the truth.
[00:17:11.049 --> 00:17:11.849]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:14.070]  It's just she's standing up for the Second Amendment.
[00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:14.771]  That's what it's all about.
[00:17:17.065 --> 00:17:19.226]  Why don't we celebrate lower murder rates?
[00:17:19.226 --> 00:17:20.326]  That's right, it's down 61%.
[00:17:20.326 --> 00:17:25.187]  I went with the Justice Department numbers that came out two years ago and they said 51.
[00:17:25.187 --> 00:17:34.689]  And we crunched the numbers and had an actual statistician from Southwest Texas do the analysis around South Texas.
[00:17:34.689 --> 00:17:38.110]  And they found out he did it even though he wasn't published in it and threatened to fire him.
[00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:39.850]  That was Rob Due's brother.
[00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:44.672]  He's now a statistician for a big company.
[00:17:44.672 --> 00:17:46.272]  And he's got a doctorate in it.
[00:17:47.213 --> 00:17:47.793]  Isn't it a doctor?
[00:17:47.793 --> 00:17:48.554]  Yeah.
[00:17:48.554 --> 00:17:54.797]  And we found 51% drop in violent crime using guns since 92.
[00:17:54.797 --> 00:17:55.858]  Confirming Justice Department numbers.
[00:17:55.858 --> 00:17:59.720]  But Lott, one of the top statisticians in the world, said no, it's 61.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:06.244]  So folks, 61% drop in crime using guns because gun ownership has exploded.
[00:18:06.244 --> 00:18:08.506]  And they've imprisoned a lot of criminals.
[00:18:08.506 --> 00:18:11.667]  And people are blowing away criminals more and more.
[00:18:11.667 --> 00:18:15.670]  And that's most of the 12,000 deaths a year are people committing suicide or criminals getting blown away.
[00:18:17.918 --> 00:18:20.739]  And so she gets up there and says, why don't you celebrate it?
[00:18:20.739 --> 00:18:26.060]  Instead, Obama just keeps getting up there going, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse.
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:32.061]  I've even heard ads on the network for body armor, which is great body armor, but it says the mass shootings are happening and it's getting worse.
[00:18:32.061 --> 00:18:33.161]  Get your body armor.
[00:18:33.161 --> 00:18:33.801]  No, it's not.
[00:18:33.801 --> 00:18:37.382]  It's not true.
[00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:38.622]  Mass shootings are flat.
[00:18:38.622 --> 00:18:42.863]  Every other form of gun violence is down massively.
[00:18:42.863 --> 00:18:44.844]  And statistics don't lie, folks.
[00:18:44.844 --> 00:18:45.684]  Numbers don't lie.
[00:18:48.322 --> 00:18:53.686]  The media acts like the biggest issue in the country is cops shooting you.
[00:18:53.686 --> 00:19:01.051]  You're talking about a couple hundred people, maybe a year, that are unjustifiable, and I'm not even defending the police culture or what's going on.
[00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:02.072]  I'm a big critic of it.
[00:19:02.072 --> 00:19:03.533]  I'm just not going to sit here and lie to you.
[00:19:03.533 --> 00:19:08.716]  When all you turn on TV, it's the end of the world, the cops are going to kill you, and it just isn't true!
[00:19:08.716 --> 00:19:11.038]  They kill 1,100 people a year!
[00:19:11.038 --> 00:19:12.619]  On a bad year!
[00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:13.860]  And most of them are criminals!
[00:19:15.242 --> 00:19:17.984]  Most of it is the police defending people against criminals.
[00:19:17.984 --> 00:19:19.564]  I'm all for good people armed.
[00:19:19.564 --> 00:19:21.165]  Police, citizens, you name it.
[00:19:21.165 --> 00:19:22.746]  Most police are good.
[00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:25.168]  That's why they're attacking them in the media.
[00:19:25.168 --> 00:19:28.590]  To get a civil war going in this country.
[00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:32.692]  And I'm not gonna sit here idly by and watch all hell break loose.
[00:19:32.692 --> 00:19:35.133]  Now let me give you the big news.
[00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:43.298]  Obama said in a speech repeatedly in his talk at the town hall on CNN that he doesn't want the guns and these conspiracy sites are bad, lying about it.
[00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:51.973]  And then CNN ran an op-ed saying, declare civil emergency, that's what they're gonna call martial law, and take the guns.
[00:19:51.973 --> 00:19:54.234]  And basically have a civil war.
[00:19:54.234 --> 00:19:56.295]  They actually say it.
[00:19:56.295 --> 00:19:59.357]  CNN.
[00:19:59.357 --> 00:20:02.079]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[00:20:02.079 --> 00:20:05.581]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[00:20:06.778 --> 00:20:10.260]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:15.702]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[00:20:15.702 --> 00:20:17.203]  How is this even possible?
[00:20:17.203 --> 00:20:24.746]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[00:20:24.746 --> 00:20:32.389]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[00:20:32.389 --> 00:20:35.591]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[00:20:35.871 --> 00:20:43.679]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:46.842]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[00:20:46.842 --> 00:20:51.067]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[00:20:51.067 --> 00:20:51.667]  That's Greens75.com.
[00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:52.068]  Greens75.com.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:05.522]  Chronic inflammation is now known to block your ability to repair and compromises your immune system, making you more vulnerable to all diseases.
[00:21:05.522 --> 00:21:10.704]  Since poor diet, injuries, or stress are all contributing factors, many people suffer from inflammation.
[00:21:10.704 --> 00:21:15.846]  Your body's number one means of neutralizing inflammation and the pain that it may be causing is glutathione.
[00:21:15.846 --> 00:21:20.387]  Glutathione is the body's number one peptide to neutralize free radicals and thus stop inflammation.
[00:21:20.387 --> 00:21:22.048]  Hi, my name is Jason.
[00:21:22.048 --> 00:21:22.548]  I'm 44 years old.
[00:21:22.728 --> 00:21:29.115]  For ten years, I had been suffering from chronic pain in my abdomen and groin that radiated down into my feet.
[00:21:29.115 --> 00:21:36.444]  After three weeks on One World Way, the pain in my feet reduced by 50% and the overall pain in my body reduced significantly as well.
[00:21:36.444 --> 00:21:37.485]  I ran out of One World Way
[00:21:37.725 --> 00:21:39.206]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com
[00:21:58.891 --> 00:22:00.452]  We've all heard the news stories.
[00:22:00.452 --> 00:22:01.593]  Another shooting.
[00:22:01.593 --> 00:22:03.295]  And they're getting worse.
[00:22:03.295 --> 00:22:06.858]  That's why Infidel Body Armor introduces Infidel Fridays.

[00:22:57.435 --> 00:23:04.523]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[00:23:04.523 --> 00:23:08.527]  It caught me totally by surprise, and it involves FEMA.
[00:23:08.527 --> 00:23:11.911]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[00:23:11.911 --> 00:23:16.996]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[00:23:17.597 --> 00:23:21.961]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again.
[00:23:21.961 --> 00:23:28.126]  But be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is, they must know something we don't.
[00:23:28.126 --> 00:23:38.135]  Go to FEMA3.com to see the number one item you should be hoarding and why supplies of this critical item are so low or even completely sold out at many stores across America.
[00:23:38.835 --> 00:23:40.076]  Don't miss out.
[00:23:40.076 --> 00:23:45.279]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in recent days.
[00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:50.882]  Go to FEMA3.com and discover the number one most critical item in a crisis.
[00:23:50.882 --> 00:23:54.525]  Watch the shocking video right now at FEMA3.com.
[00:23:54.525 --> 00:23:55.765]  Again, that's FEMA3.com.
[00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:16.631]  I have never owned a gun.
[00:24:16.631 --> 00:24:24.916]  Now, up at Camp David, we've got some skeet shooting, so on a fairly regular basis, we get a 12-gauge.
[00:24:24.916 --> 00:24:34.921]  I'm not making any claims about my marksmanship, but... Before you were president, did you ever feel a desire to get a gun, feel the need to get a gun?
[00:24:34.921 --> 00:24:42.806]  You know, I grew up mostly in Hawaii, and other than hunting for wild pig,
[00:24:43.659 --> 00:24:45.821]  Uh, which they do once in a while.
[00:24:45.821 --> 00:24:55.828]  Um, you know, there's not, uh, the popularity of, uh, hunting and sportsmanship with guns, uh, as much as there are in other parts of the country.
[00:24:55.828 --> 00:24:56.548]  Right.
[00:24:56.548 --> 00:25:03.674]  I, I mean, I ask the question because there's a lot of people out there who don't trust you, obviously, on the issue of guns.
[00:25:03.674 --> 00:25:04.834]  Now, there you go.
[00:25:04.834 --> 00:25:09.518]  The only truthful thing Obama, in my view, researching this entire disgusting two-hour event,
[00:25:12.964 --> 00:25:16.026]  Is that they are disconnected.
[00:25:16.026 --> 00:25:23.632]  Most of the people that are anti-gun, most of these elitists, have never been around guns, never owned guns, never used guns.
[00:25:23.632 --> 00:25:29.396]  Because even major conservatives that are rich and part of the establishment, they just can't help it.
[00:25:29.396 --> 00:25:31.738]  They love the culture so much.
[00:25:31.738 --> 00:25:34.580]  It's in the DNA to be armed as a free person.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.723]  They just can't bring themselves to totally ban the guns.
[00:25:38.723 --> 00:25:40.184]  But that's very few of the elite.
[00:25:41.496 --> 00:25:46.697]  And they're almost universally protected by bodyguards, taxpayer money.
[00:25:46.697 --> 00:25:48.518]  And so they really are disconnected.
[00:25:48.518 --> 00:25:55.939]  And they're scared of the slaves having guns.
[00:25:55.939 --> 00:25:57.360]  Slaves don't have free speech.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.860]  Slaves aren't allowed to have weapons.
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.361]  Whether it was the Roman Empire or the Deep South with slavery in say 1800.
[00:26:02.361 --> 00:26:04.441]  It's a fact.
[00:26:04.441 --> 00:26:11.043]  And it's a fact gun control laws were passed at the end of the Civil War, the first ever in this country, to keep black people from getting guns.
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.602]  Now, let's continue.
[00:26:17.602 --> 00:26:26.567]  President Obama, on the notion of a plot, a conspiracy, and he says nobody is coming for your guns.
[00:26:26.567 --> 00:26:30.610]  That is the biggest bald-faced lie I've ever heard.
[00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.871]  They take the guns in every other country.
[00:26:32.871 --> 00:26:33.692]  Total gun bans.
[00:26:34.451 --> 00:26:37.594]  They take the guns in Chicago, New York, D.C.
[00:26:37.594 --> 00:26:39.115]  They want total abolition.
[00:26:39.115 --> 00:26:43.299]  They're all on record at the major think tanks, the Bloomberg groups.
[00:26:43.299 --> 00:26:49.644]  But they have this double lie where they go, Bloomberg came out last year and said, I'm the biggest Second Amendment supporter ever.
[00:26:49.644 --> 00:26:50.545]  He goes, I support it.
[00:26:52.483 --> 00:26:53.144]  People are like, what?
[00:26:53.144 --> 00:26:54.805]  It's like, lower your defenses.
[00:26:54.805 --> 00:27:00.950]  It's like Saving Private Ryan, where, you know, they're fighting, rolling around with the knives, and the G.I.
[00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:02.231]  is about to win.
[00:27:02.231 --> 00:27:07.556]  So the German goes, no, no, no, I give up, just to make him hesitate enough to drive that knife into him.
[00:27:09.445 --> 00:27:10.326]  And that's what this is.
[00:27:10.326 --> 00:27:22.857]  I mean, these people want our guns, and how creepy is it to have them up on TV going, nobody wants your guns, and we're all supposed to play along with it, and by the way, gun crime's way up, and everybody just goes along with it.
[00:27:22.857 --> 00:27:25.079]  All lies!
[00:27:25.079 --> 00:27:33.386]  Crumb-known liars who said in their first campaign in 2008, no one's coming after any guns, we believe in it, there'll be no new gun laws.
[00:27:34.426 --> 00:27:42.671]  And all they've done is launch attacks, and they have all these countless, I'm talking thousands of articles that I've seen the last six, seven years, saying, I'm insane.
[00:27:42.671 --> 00:27:44.952]  Nobody wants our guns.
[00:27:44.952 --> 00:27:45.733]  I'm insane.
[00:27:45.733 --> 00:27:47.914]  He won't use executive action on the guns.
[00:27:47.914 --> 00:27:48.855]  I kept saying he would.
[00:27:48.855 --> 00:27:52.157]  2013, he said, I can't use executive action.
[00:27:52.157 --> 00:27:53.598]  We played the clip yesterday.
[00:27:53.598 --> 00:27:55.359]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:27:55.359 --> 00:28:03.764]  Now he says, I'm going to act because Congress won't get in line with incredibly draconian stuff that Congress couldn't pass under the Constitution.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.644]  They can't even do this, but he's doing it flagrantly illegal!
[00:28:09.644 --> 00:28:12.006]  Let's go to the president on the conspiracies.
[00:28:12.006 --> 00:28:13.087]  Here it is.
[00:28:13.087 --> 00:28:14.668]  Is it fair to call it a conspiracy?
[00:28:14.668 --> 00:28:17.351]  I mean, a lot of people really believe this deeply.
[00:28:17.351 --> 00:28:20.193]  That they just don't trust you.
[00:28:20.193 --> 00:28:21.134]  I'm sorry, Cooper.
[00:28:21.134 --> 00:28:22.796]  Yes, it is fair to call it a conspiracy.
[00:28:22.796 --> 00:28:23.576]  What are you saying?
[00:28:26.829 --> 00:28:38.712]  Are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody's guns away so that we can impose martial law is a conspiracy?
[00:28:38.712 --> 00:28:40.272]  Yes, that is a conspiracy.
[00:28:40.272 --> 00:28:42.672]  I would hope that you would agree with that.
[00:28:42.672 --> 00:28:44.393]  We're going to go to break, back on the plate again.
[00:28:44.393 --> 00:28:47.053]  This is so profound.
[00:28:47.053 --> 00:28:51.234]  We've had 7 million views just on Facebook mentions.
[00:28:51.234 --> 00:28:53.875]  That's just a new platform we're using, invading that system.
[00:28:55.205 --> 00:28:59.867]  Jay-Z doesn't get that in a week, folks.
[00:28:59.867 --> 00:29:01.708]  Kanye West.
[00:29:01.708 --> 00:29:05.730]  Barack Obama goes on his Facebook and gets like 10,000 views on a video.
[00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.351]  Go look.
[00:29:07.351 --> 00:29:10.953]  That just shows we're just one outlet fighting him.
[00:29:10.953 --> 00:29:13.574]  7 million people.
[00:29:13.574 --> 00:29:15.575]  And guess what the video titles are?
[00:29:15.575 --> 00:29:18.157]  Obama bringing in martial law.
[00:29:18.157 --> 00:29:21.078]  Gun control to be used under martial law.
[00:29:21.078 --> 00:29:23.379]  And guess what CNN called for yesterday?
[00:29:23.379 --> 00:29:24.100]  I have the article.
[00:29:25.672 --> 00:29:38.094]  In the article, Victim's Father, Obama's Gun Actions Won't Make a Dent, Elliot Feynman, CNN op-ed calls for Obama to declare national state of emergency, close quote, to gut the Second Amendment.
[00:29:38.094 --> 00:29:45.035]  They're calling for a state of emergency to confiscate and to nationalize the gun manufacturers.
[00:29:45.035 --> 00:29:48.416]  If that ain't martial law, I don't know what is!
[00:29:48.416 --> 00:29:51.936]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.936 --> 00:29:54.637]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.829 --> 00:30:05.392]  A Missouri bill defines sex between lawmakers and lobbyists as a gift, reports NBC News.
[00:30:05.392 --> 00:30:17.077]  Lobbyists in Missouri who have sex with state lawmakers or their aides would have to disclose that activity to the State Ethics Commission under a bill introduced this week by a Republican state representative.
[00:30:17.077 --> 00:30:28.062]  The measure, pushed by Representative Bart Corman, defines sexual relations between lawmakers and lobbyists as a gift to be reported on the disclosure forms that lobbyists file on a monthly basis.
[00:30:28.402 --> 00:30:32.184]  The bill does not assign a dollar valuation to the gift of sex.
[00:30:32.184 --> 00:30:38.488]  Corman's proposal, reported early Thursday by the Kansas City Star, quickly gained attention on social media.
[00:30:38.488 --> 00:30:47.113]  And Corman told USA Today that he was fielding calls from reporters all across the country, demanding to know more about his unorthodox proposal.
[00:30:47.113 --> 00:30:50.775]  I guess this has gone viral or something, he was quoted as saying.
[00:30:50.775 --> 00:30:54.617]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:30:58.638 --> 00:31:02.160]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:10.403]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:10.403 --> 00:31:15.825]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.192]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:31:40.192 --> 00:31:43.693]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:31:43.693 --> 00:31:45.394]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.

[00:31:58.382 --> 00:32:05.286]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.tv, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[00:32:05.286 --> 00:32:08.168]  We've always offered five months free.
[00:32:08.168 --> 00:32:13.731]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[00:32:14.071 --> 00:32:17.332]  PrisonPlanet.tv began 15 years ago.
[00:32:17.332 --> 00:32:20.773]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[00:32:20.773 --> 00:32:29.756]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:29.756 --> 00:32:40.460]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's, you also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously using your username.

[00:33:01.807 --> 00:33:04.148]  I was trained in firearms.
[00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:06.288]  I carried a concealed weapon.
[00:33:06.288 --> 00:33:15.270]  I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going to take them with me.
[00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:29.114]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:33:31.044 --> 00:33:35.946]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:35.946 --> 00:33:39.608]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.608 --> 00:33:47.032]  I've gone past the point of having chills when I think about what's happening, to just being steady and focused and strong now.
[00:33:47.032 --> 00:33:55.315]  Because my instincts, my gut, and also intellectually, politically, the battle's on.
[00:33:55.315 --> 00:33:56.116]  The fight's here.
[00:33:57.648 --> 00:33:59.869]  No more questions, no more doubts.
[00:33:59.869 --> 00:34:04.291]  It's all as bad as we thought it was, and then some.
[00:34:04.291 --> 00:34:10.834]  Complete weaponized media, total lies, total deception.
[00:34:10.834 --> 00:34:11.975]  The attempt to break our back.
[00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:28.200]  I've got like 13, 14 clips, actually, more than 12, because we've got a compilation of Obama saying Bush's executive actions are illegal and a total threat, because he's a constitutional lawyer, he knows that, which was true!
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.182]  Then he gets up and does stuff.
[00:34:31.182 --> 00:34:32.924]  Jonathan Turley says three times worse.
[00:34:32.924 --> 00:34:35.346]  Eh, it's 15 times worse.
[00:34:35.346 --> 00:34:44.253]  When I say thousands of times worse than Nixon, Nixon had 120-something names in a safe and was thinking about harassing a couple of them with IRS audits.
[00:34:45.313 --> 00:34:49.376]  Obama's gone after more than 10,000 Christian groups alone!
[00:34:49.376 --> 00:34:59.204]  That's 10,000 times worse than not going after anybody.
[00:34:59.204 --> 00:35:02.867]  I saw a comment, oh I heard Alex say he's thousands of times worse than Nixon.
[00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:04.428]  How's that possible?
[00:35:04.428 --> 00:35:08.912]  Well, I mean, just on the IRS thing, he's tens of thousands of times worse.
[00:35:11.058 --> 00:35:16.680]  I mean, imagine if Obama's scandal was breaking in some Republican's psychiatrist's office.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:21.622]  That's child's play!
[00:35:21.622 --> 00:35:24.043]  Defunding Al-Qaeda and ISIS stuff.
[00:35:24.043 --> 00:35:29.766]  Murder tens of thousands of people a month in Libya and Syria ongoing.
[00:35:29.766 --> 00:35:33.788]  Take every progressive Muslim and chop their head off.
[00:35:33.788 --> 00:35:36.689]  They're murdering the black Africans in Libya.
[00:35:36.689 --> 00:35:37.529]  The black Muslims.
[00:35:37.529 --> 00:35:39.390]  That's how racist a lot of these Wahhabis are.
[00:35:41.286 --> 00:35:44.088]  Oh man, I tell you, Saudi Arabian Wahhabis hate black people so much.
[00:35:44.088 --> 00:35:47.171]  They were the original slavers of black people.
[00:35:47.171 --> 00:35:49.393]  I mean, I'm sorry, I'm just cursed with history.
[00:35:49.393 --> 00:36:03.264]  Stefan Molyneux, who is a historian, is going to be joining us coming up in the second hour from the actual histories of who kicked off the slave trade, the modern slave trade, post-Roman, post-Byzantine.
[00:36:03.264 --> 00:36:06.907]  Who brought back slavery?
[00:36:06.907 --> 00:36:08.909]  The North African Muslims and the Saudis.
[00:36:12.443 --> 00:36:15.504]  It's a historical fact.
[00:36:15.504 --> 00:36:16.925]  Look how they treat women.
[00:36:16.925 --> 00:36:21.707]  Oh, by the way, photos show gunmen shooting Philly cop in the name of Islam.
[00:36:21.707 --> 00:36:24.448]  Religion of Peace strikes again.
[00:36:24.448 --> 00:36:27.990]  And Obama's response is, of course, take our guns.
[00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:32.692]  We're having a radical Muslim attack now every week or two in the U.S.
[00:36:32.692 --> 00:36:34.532]  They had another attack in France yesterday.
[00:36:34.532 --> 00:36:35.573]  It's just ongoing.
[00:36:37.777 --> 00:36:40.360]  And it's going to be used to demonize non-radical Muslims.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.704]  That's why Louis Furkan says something needs to be done.
[00:36:43.704 --> 00:36:44.464]  Trump's right.
[00:36:44.464 --> 00:36:47.588]  Because Louis Furkan doesn't actually want to have a race war in this country.
[00:36:47.588 --> 00:36:49.950]  You can say, well, he used to want one.
[00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:53.134]  Well, the interview's coming out.
[00:36:53.134 --> 00:36:54.115]  Wait till you see it.
[00:36:54.115 --> 00:36:56.478]  I can't even get my mind around it.
[00:36:56.478 --> 00:36:58.179]  I really am actually stunned by it.
[00:36:59.343 --> 00:37:01.984]  That's why I was telling Farrakhan, I said, can I have a month to edit this?
[00:37:01.984 --> 00:37:06.625]  I really want to do a good job and add clips and try to... I mean, I don't know what to do here.
[00:37:06.625 --> 00:37:11.866]  It's so powerful and his people want to put it out quicker.
[00:37:11.866 --> 00:37:16.907]  He said, do whatever I want, but I'm going to try to get it out by next week because people are already talking about it all over.
[00:37:16.907 --> 00:37:25.209]  And I actually asked him to be interviewed a month ago until we could try to stop a race war that George Soros is financing.
[00:37:25.209 --> 00:37:26.710]  And he said, absolutely, I agree.
[00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:27.350]  Come talk to me.
[00:37:28.752 --> 00:37:29.832]  And then it was just, it was crazy.
[00:37:29.832 --> 00:37:34.313]  I was there with the entire leadership of the Nation of Islam, and these guys were super smart.
[00:37:34.313 --> 00:37:37.434]  And I don't mean that condescending like, you know, black folks, they were smart for black folks.
[00:37:37.434 --> 00:37:42.195]  No, I meant like, I've never been in a room with people this astute about the world and things.
[00:37:42.195 --> 00:37:46.356]  It was, and I've been in the room with like top military people.
[00:37:46.356 --> 00:37:49.656]  It was wild.
[00:37:49.656 --> 00:37:51.076]  Wild.
[00:37:51.076 --> 00:37:53.217]  I mean, I've been places, I was asking, I said, does anybody
[00:37:54.195 --> 00:37:54.756]  Get in here?
[00:37:54.756 --> 00:38:01.647]  I mean, who else comes in this big room and meets with you guys for three hours?
[00:38:01.647 --> 00:38:03.631]  He basically said, well, pretty much nobody.
[00:38:06.061 --> 00:38:17.731]  He said, you know, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were sitting where you were sitting last year and all those other famous people, but he said we don't really get into all the politics stuff, but he thinks it's coming down to the end right now as well.
[00:38:17.731 --> 00:38:19.813]  And, you know, I'd rather not fight with people, folks.
[00:38:19.813 --> 00:38:24.998]  I'd rather just live in peace and not all kill each other so a bunch of foreign bankers can make a joke out of it.
[00:38:24.998 --> 00:38:26.939]  Some creepy, weird Nazi collaborator?
[00:38:26.939 --> 00:38:29.421]  We're going to be played off by him?
[00:38:29.421 --> 00:38:29.882]  I mean, you know.
[00:38:32.065 --> 00:38:34.468]  It's powerful, and I'm not even hyping the interview.
[00:38:34.468 --> 00:38:40.276]  I want to respect the interview and really do a good job with it, make like a documentary out of it, but that'll come later, I guess.
[00:38:40.276 --> 00:38:41.377]  We're just going to churn it out then.
[00:38:41.377 --> 00:38:44.661]  Let me just stop right there.
[00:38:44.661 --> 00:38:49.528]  Let's start going to the clips right now.
[00:38:49.528 --> 00:38:50.389]  President Obama.
[00:38:52.506 --> 00:38:53.747]  On the conspiracy.
[00:38:53.747 --> 00:38:55.148]  He's sitting there like it's ridiculous.
[00:38:55.148 --> 00:38:57.209]  There's a plan to get your guns?
[00:38:57.209 --> 00:39:06.995]  I mean, the UNIDIR UN treaty says that they want the quote, abolition of civilian firearm ownership because it threatens the legitimate power monopoly of a state.
[00:39:06.995 --> 00:39:13.039]  July 7th, 2000 in the treaty.
[00:39:13.039 --> 00:39:15.300]  They've taken the guns in almost every country.
[00:39:16.889 --> 00:39:20.512]  And they always say, we just want to register and ban the semi-autos.
[00:39:20.512 --> 00:39:22.234]  Then they start banning more and more.
[00:39:22.234 --> 00:39:24.656]  Then they use the registration list to take the guns.
[00:39:24.656 --> 00:39:29.901]  And you've got to jump through a hundred hoops if you live on a farm to have a single-shot shotgun.
[00:39:29.901 --> 00:39:31.362]  That's what they do in France.
[00:39:31.362 --> 00:39:32.644]  That's what they do in Australia.
[00:39:32.644 --> 00:39:36.167]  Other areas, they've just totally banned them.
[00:39:36.167 --> 00:39:42.513]  Women with no criminal records are trying to go through all the hoops now to get shotguns that have even been raped, and the Germans won't let them have them.
[00:39:43.916 --> 00:39:57.445]  You gotta be in a hunting club and keep your gun with the hunting master, the Jaeger master, the hunting master, and then go put your lederhosen on and go hunting.
[00:39:57.445 --> 00:40:01.728]  See, it's not about self-defense, it's about hunting!
[00:40:01.728 --> 00:40:02.228]  No, it's not.
[00:40:02.228 --> 00:40:04.249]  It's about self-defense.
[00:40:04.249 --> 00:40:09.453]  And I know there's so many clips here, but I just can't get over the lying point-blank to our faces.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:18.462]  And telling us that they're not coming for our guns!
[00:40:18.462 --> 00:40:20.243]  It's just like everything else they do!
[00:40:20.243 --> 00:40:25.205]  I've never seen such levels of lying!
[00:40:25.205 --> 00:40:28.247]  Let's go to President Obama on the plot, the conspiracy.
[00:40:28.247 --> 00:40:33.389]  I mean, they're sworn to get our guns!
[00:40:33.389 --> 00:40:34.490]  They're doing it illegally!
[00:40:36.288 --> 00:40:43.753]  They're saying they'll put you on an extrajudicial list with no evidence, no court, no trial, no faces, nobody to call, and your guns are just taken.
[00:40:43.753 --> 00:40:46.135]  Or you can't buy guns!
[00:40:46.135 --> 00:40:50.839]  They're already implementing it in many areas around the country.
[00:40:50.839 --> 00:41:02.307]  They're setting up UN bases in every major city under strong city initiative to globalize them and to henpeck the police into submitting to them.
[00:41:02.307 --> 00:41:03.648]  I mean, we're being taken over.
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:09.504]  And he sits up there and says, nothing's happening, nothing's going on.
[00:41:09.504 --> 00:41:12.406]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[00:41:12.406 --> 00:41:13.427]  Here it is.
[00:41:13.427 --> 00:41:15.009]  Is it fair to call it a conspiracy?
[00:41:15.009 --> 00:41:20.534]  I mean, a lot of people really believe this deeply, that they just don't trust you.
[00:41:20.534 --> 00:41:21.495]  I'm sorry, Cooper.
[00:41:21.495 --> 00:41:23.136]  Yes, it is fair to call it a conspiracy.
[00:41:23.136 --> 00:41:23.937]  What are you saying?
[00:41:27.168 --> 00:41:39.057]  Are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody's guns away so that we can impose martial law is a conspiracy?
[00:41:39.057 --> 00:41:40.639]  Yes, that is a conspiracy.
[00:41:40.639 --> 00:41:42.920]  I would hope that you would agree with that.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.522]  Is that controversial?
[00:41:44.522 --> 00:41:46.103]  Now let's pause.
[00:41:46.103 --> 00:41:48.585]  Is it controversial that they're developing a plan?
[00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.272]  That is the most sophisticated doublespeak I've ever heard.
[00:41:53.272 --> 00:41:56.574]  Because he's actually being honest, going, there is a conspiracy.
[00:41:56.574 --> 00:41:59.536]  See, a plot is just an illegal plan.
[00:41:59.536 --> 00:42:09.002]  So there is a plan, it is unconstitutional, it is illegal, it is dangerous, it is tyrannical by every historical measurement.
[00:42:09.002 --> 00:42:13.485]  So he sits there, back it up again, this is one of the richest clips I've ever seen.
[00:42:13.485 --> 00:42:14.766]  And he said, listen to him carefully.
[00:42:16.138 --> 00:42:17.099]  He says, is there a conspiracy?
[00:42:17.099 --> 00:42:18.579]  Well, yeah, I mean, is there a plot?
[00:42:18.579 --> 00:42:19.840]  Is there a get the guns?
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.822]  And then he goes, oh, it's ridiculous after that.
[00:42:22.822 --> 00:42:26.624]  He's sitting there talking to a known CIA asset.
[00:42:26.624 --> 00:42:28.685]  Since college.
[00:42:28.685 --> 00:42:31.046]  He's CIA.
[00:42:31.046 --> 00:42:32.527]  Part of the rogue group that runs it.
[00:42:32.527 --> 00:42:34.288]  The breakaway globalist.
[00:42:34.288 --> 00:42:36.529]  The coup d'etat.
[00:42:36.529 --> 00:42:37.490]  The occupiers.
[00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:41.192]  They're not even collaborators because they were never Americans.
[00:42:41.192 --> 00:42:43.233]  I mean, Cooper is literally
[00:42:44.528 --> 00:42:48.750]  Sitting on top of what is estimated to be over a trillion dollars in assets.
[00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:51.212]  You hear about Bill Gates, 100 billion, this guy 100 billion.
[00:42:51.212 --> 00:42:53.233]  That's just the public money.
[00:42:53.233 --> 00:42:57.315]  This guy is related to most of the major robber baron dynasties.
[00:42:57.315 --> 00:43:01.237]  Look it up.
[00:43:01.237 --> 00:43:07.101]  He's CIA, he's a blood sucking blue blood, and he's up there to enslave this country.
[00:43:07.101 --> 00:43:10.843]  Just like the CIA finances dictators to take the weapons in every other country.
[00:43:10.843 --> 00:43:11.863]  That's what they're doing here.
[00:43:11.863 --> 00:43:12.464]  It's treason.
[00:43:13.419 --> 00:43:16.102]  Except they're foreign enemies, so it's espionage.
[00:43:16.102 --> 00:43:18.385]  I gotta stop calling Obama treasonous and treacherous.
[00:43:18.385 --> 00:43:24.011]  He's a globalist operative, he's a foreign officer, he's involved in espionage and sabotage.
[00:43:24.011 --> 00:43:27.095]  He is a saboteur!
[00:43:27.095 --> 00:43:28.456]  Literally!
[00:43:28.456 --> 00:43:30.299]  An enemy!
[00:43:30.299 --> 00:43:32.261]  How much more naked does it have to get?
[00:43:32.261 --> 00:43:33.122]  Let's go back to the clip.
[00:43:34.164 --> 00:43:35.726]  Is it fair to call it a conspiracy?
[00:43:35.726 --> 00:43:38.410]  I mean, there's a lot of people who really believe this deeply.
[00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:41.234]  That they just don't trust you.
[00:43:41.234 --> 00:43:42.216]  I'm sorry, Cooper.
[00:43:42.216 --> 00:43:43.858]  Yes, it is fair to call it a conspiracy.
[00:43:43.858 --> 00:43:44.639]  What are you saying?
[00:43:47.588 --> 00:43:48.308]  The railroads, everything.
[00:43:48.308 --> 00:43:59.791]  Are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody's guns away so that we can impose martial law is a conspiracy?
[00:43:59.791 --> 00:44:01.351]  Yes, that is a conspiracy.
[00:44:01.351 --> 00:44:03.611]  I would hope that you would agree with that.
[00:44:03.611 --> 00:44:05.532]  Is that controversial?
[00:44:05.532 --> 00:44:07.972]  Except on some websites, certainly around the country?
[00:44:07.972 --> 00:44:13.053]  There are certainly a lot of people who just have a fundamental distrust that you... Hey, pause.
[00:44:13.053 --> 00:44:15.594]  So, see, I mean, is there a plan to get some guns?
[00:44:15.594 --> 00:44:16.214]  Well, yeah!
[00:44:17.034 --> 00:44:26.759]  And you know, these websites around the country that people believe and listen to because we show them!
[00:44:26.759 --> 00:44:29.100]  What a con artist!
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.781]  Finish the clip, it just gets crazier.
[00:44:31.781 --> 00:44:33.662]  Is that controversial?
[00:44:33.662 --> 00:44:36.123]  Except on some websites around the country?
[00:44:36.123 --> 00:44:43.647]  There are certainly a lot of people who just have a fundamental distrust that you do not want to go further and further and further.
[00:44:43.647 --> 00:44:44.367]  Like Obamacare?
[00:44:46.119 --> 00:44:48.320]  I mean, I'm only going to be here for another year.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:54.142]  I don't know, when would I have started on this enterprise?
[00:44:54.142 --> 00:44:54.642]  Day one!
[00:44:54.642 --> 00:44:57.903]  Right?
[00:44:57.903 --> 00:45:07.466]  I come from the state of Illinois, which we've been talking about Chicago, but downstate Illinois is closer to Kentucky.
[00:45:07.466 --> 00:45:09.967]  But the crime syndicate you run took all the guns.
[00:45:09.967 --> 00:45:12.568]  Total gun ban in Chicago until the Supreme Court ruling.
[00:45:13.419 --> 00:45:16.481]  Uh, and... Oh, that's enough, shut it down.
[00:45:16.481 --> 00:45:21.305]  Again, he keeps acting like because they haven't taken all the guns yet, that shows that no one's taken the guns.
[00:45:21.305 --> 00:45:23.046]  Everywhere they run, they've taken them all.
[00:45:23.046 --> 00:45:26.889]  I mean, again, he's preying on his supporters.
[00:45:26.889 --> 00:45:31.213]  And I'm sorry, man, I've looked... I'm gonna go out and do some videos and just point at crowds in Austin.
[00:45:32.458 --> 00:45:47.608]  And I mean, they're soft, they're dumb, they're dead-eyed, I don't care if they're Hispanic, black, white, or Asian, they're fat, and I'm not being mean to fat people, none of us are perfect, but I mean, they look like they haven't worked a day in their lives and can't even wipe their butts.
[00:45:47.608 --> 00:45:49.329]  Their eyes are so weak.
[00:45:49.329 --> 00:45:50.090]  They're so dead.
[00:45:52.176 --> 00:45:53.017]  They're helpless.
[00:45:53.017 --> 00:45:55.099]  They have no survival instinct.
[00:45:55.099 --> 00:45:57.200]  And I'll say whatever you want about the Nation of Islam.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.962]  I disagree with a lot of stuff they've said and done.
[00:45:58.962 --> 00:46:00.764]  But when I was there, those people were alive.
[00:46:00.764 --> 00:46:02.325]  Their eyes had fire in them.
[00:46:02.325 --> 00:46:03.986]  And it might be hate.
[00:46:03.986 --> 00:46:04.567]  But you know what?
[00:46:04.567 --> 00:46:06.849]  I'll take some of that hate over death any day.
[00:46:06.849 --> 00:46:07.489]  Being dead.
[00:46:07.489 --> 00:46:08.851]  And it isn't hate.
[00:46:08.851 --> 00:46:10.312]  It's anger at being enslaved.
[00:46:10.312 --> 00:46:10.852]  And I get it.
[00:46:10.852 --> 00:46:11.893]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:46:11.893 --> 00:46:13.114]  I don't want to be a slave either.
[00:46:13.114 --> 00:46:16.117]  And I'm angry.
[00:46:16.117 --> 00:46:17.118]  And I'm not rolling over.
[00:46:24.107 --> 00:46:26.552]  And Donald Trump's not rolling over.
[00:46:26.552 --> 00:46:33.947]  And our veterans aren't rolling over to be enslaved.
[00:46:33.947 --> 00:46:35.290]  Let's go ahead and go to clip number three.
[00:46:37.145 --> 00:46:44.330]  Where we need everything to be smart guns, which then they use to ban all the previous made guns, and then they could deactivate the other guns.
[00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:46.312]  This is the biggest attack ever.
[00:46:46.312 --> 00:46:50.335]  And this is what they have neocons on Fox News going, you know, it's reasonable.
[00:46:50.335 --> 00:46:51.155]  We're not against that.
[00:46:51.155 --> 00:46:52.256]  Let's do that.
[00:46:52.256 --> 00:46:55.899]  That just shut down all the manufacturers in California this year.
[00:46:55.899 --> 00:46:58.261]  They all just shut this week and are moving out.
[00:47:00.782 --> 00:47:01.223]  So let's go.
[00:47:01.223 --> 00:47:02.985]  I mean, you love your smart meter ripping you off?
[00:47:02.985 --> 00:47:05.488]  You love the smart car about to tax you by the mile?
[00:47:05.488 --> 00:47:06.689]  It's all being announced!
[00:47:06.689 --> 00:47:07.931]  I warned you 20 years ago!
[00:47:07.931 --> 00:47:10.514]  Because they wrote white papers on it.
[00:47:10.514 --> 00:47:12.777]  Nobody wants to tax you by the mile.
[00:47:12.777 --> 00:47:13.358]  Nobody!
[00:47:13.358 --> 00:47:15.240]  The smart meters don't rip you off.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.942]  They're not going to control your thermostat.
[00:47:16.942 --> 00:47:18.204]  Now it's all happening.
[00:47:18.204 --> 00:47:19.405]  They admit it all.
[00:47:19.405 --> 00:47:19.686]  Again.
[00:47:23.339 --> 00:47:30.603]  This is a lawless president who opened the borders two years ago secretly and orders the Border Patrol to ship the illegals in.
[00:47:30.603 --> 00:47:34.785]  And then has a few hundred arrested here and there at staged events.
[00:47:34.785 --> 00:47:36.746]  I mean, this is war, people!
[00:47:36.746 --> 00:47:39.368]  This is scientific!
[00:47:39.368 --> 00:47:43.930]  With two CIA guys on TV lying to you.
[00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:45.351]  And they legalized it last year.
[00:47:45.351 --> 00:47:48.933]  Because their own people wouldn't follow orders and lie.
[00:47:48.933 --> 00:47:50.934]  And they said, look, it's the law, now follow orders.
[00:47:54.744 --> 00:47:57.645]  And so their people just started leaking everything.
[00:47:57.645 --> 00:48:01.346]  And not just to us, but to the Russians and everybody else.
[00:48:01.346 --> 00:48:08.109]  Because there are a lot of people in our government aren't going along with this globalist takeover.
[00:48:08.109 --> 00:48:10.850]  Let's go to the next clip here on the smart guns.
[00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:12.850]  Here it is.
[00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:19.553]  There's nothing else in our lives that we purchase where we don't try to make it a little safer if we can.
[00:48:19.553 --> 00:48:19.993]  Hit pause.
[00:48:21.357 --> 00:48:23.218]  That's what the nanny state's all about.
[00:48:23.218 --> 00:48:29.380]  Ban dodgeball, then ban tag, then ban football, then ban words, then ban the word mom and dad.
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:30.800]  Anything might hurt your feelings.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.221]  Ban toy guns, then they can ban the real thing.
[00:48:33.221 --> 00:48:34.221]  It's real reasonable.
[00:48:34.221 --> 00:48:38.863]  Let's just make it safer.
[00:48:38.863 --> 00:48:41.764]  More guns we get, the more the crime rate goes down, but that's his big lie.
[00:48:41.764 --> 00:48:42.604]  I'm gonna skip this break.
[00:48:42.604 --> 00:48:45.425]  Here it is.
[00:48:45.425 --> 00:48:49.086]  Traffic fatalities have gone down drastically during my lifetime.
[00:48:50.987 --> 00:48:53.409]  And part of it is technology.
[00:48:53.409 --> 00:48:59.553]  And part of it is that the National Highway Safety Administration does research.
[00:48:59.553 --> 00:49:00.173]  And that's reasonable.
[00:49:00.173 --> 00:49:00.533]  You know what?
[00:49:00.533 --> 00:49:01.814]  Seatbelts really work.
[00:49:01.814 --> 00:49:02.695]  That's reasonable.
[00:49:02.695 --> 00:49:06.097]  But that set the precedent for you to power grab.
[00:49:06.097 --> 00:49:08.238]  Airbags make a lot of sense.
[00:49:08.238 --> 00:49:09.139]  Let's try those out.
[00:49:09.139 --> 00:49:11.120]  And now they want driverless cars because they say those are safer.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.001]  Toys.
[00:49:12.001 --> 00:49:13.161]  We say, you know what?
[00:49:13.161 --> 00:49:15.383]  We find out that kids are swallowing toys all the time.
[00:49:17.096 --> 00:49:18.817]  Let's make sure.
[00:49:18.817 --> 00:49:22.819]  So again, most people, 7,000 of the deaths every year are suicide.
[00:49:22.819 --> 00:49:28.482]  And then what is it, 3,000 or 4,000 depending on the year, on average about 12,000 are criminals being shot.
[00:49:28.482 --> 00:49:31.563]  A couple thousand innocent people die a year.
[00:49:31.563 --> 00:49:32.064]  End of the world.
[00:49:32.064 --> 00:49:33.965]  Now it's one of the rarest forms of death.
[00:49:33.965 --> 00:49:35.365]  But he acts like it's the end of the world.
[00:49:35.365 --> 00:49:38.007]  And speaking of that, let's go to the widow of Chris Kyle telling the truth.
[00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:42.011]  Say, why don't you celebrate lower murder rate?
[00:49:42.011 --> 00:49:43.993]  This is a key clip.
[00:49:43.993 --> 00:49:48.557]  Because normally on these shows, they just say, gun crime's way up, and just lie.
[00:49:48.557 --> 00:49:50.038]  They just lie.
[00:49:50.038 --> 00:49:57.925]  And then their idiot viewers just believe it because, you know, skinny CIA officers in fancy suits in big sets are up there lying to them.
[00:49:57.925 --> 00:50:03.650]  Let's go ahead and go back to the Navy SEAL widow talking to the two foreign enemies.
[00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:04.011]  Here it is.
[00:50:05.316 --> 00:50:07.077]  We're at an all-time low for a murder rate.
[00:50:07.077 --> 00:50:08.118]  That's a big deal.
[00:50:08.118 --> 00:50:12.660]  And yet I think most of us in this country feel like it could happen at any moment.
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:13.961]  It could happen to any of us at any time.
[00:50:13.961 --> 00:50:16.322]  And I'm almost finished.
[00:50:16.322 --> 00:50:27.629]  When you talk about the NRA and after a mass shooting that gun sales go up, I would argue that it's not necessarily that I think somebody's going to come take my gun from me, but I want the hope and the hope that I have the right to protect myself.
[00:50:28.089 --> 00:50:29.931]  That I don't end up to be one of these families.
[00:50:29.931 --> 00:50:35.197]  That I have the freedom to carry whatever weapon I feel I need, just like your wife said on that farm road.
[00:50:35.197 --> 00:50:36.678]  The sheriffs aren't going to get to my house either.
[00:50:36.678 --> 00:50:41.143]  And I understand that background checks aren't necessarily going to stop me from getting a gun.
[00:50:41.143 --> 00:50:44.307]  But I also know that they wouldn't have stopped any of the people here in this room from killing.
[00:50:44.307 --> 00:50:46.569]  And so it seems like almost a false sense of hope.
[00:50:46.569 --> 00:50:48.371]  So why not celebrate where we are?
[00:50:48.371 --> 00:50:49.412]  I guess that's my real question.
[00:50:50.456 --> 00:50:54.220]  Celebrate that we're good people, and 99.9% of us are never going to kill anyone.
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.162]  Well, let me make a couple of points.
[00:50:56.162 --> 00:51:01.967]  First of all, thanks to your husband for his service, and thank you for your service.
[00:51:01.967 --> 00:51:09.354]  Because extraordinary heroism that he and his family have shown in protecting all of us.
[00:51:09.354 --> 00:51:10.055]  And I'm very grateful.
[00:51:10.055 --> 00:51:12.977]  Oh yeah, you love the Tribs so much, why are you raping them, cutting off their vehicles?
[00:51:14.799 --> 00:51:21.740]  What you said about murder rates and violent crime generally is something that we don't celebrate enough.
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:22.341]  It's down 61%.
[00:51:22.341 --> 00:51:27.442]  The fact of the matter is, is that violent crime has been steadily declining.
[00:51:27.442 --> 00:51:28.542]  Except in cities run by you.
[00:51:28.542 --> 00:51:30.222]  For a pretty long time.
[00:51:30.222 --> 00:51:32.403]  So this is 92, punk.
[00:51:32.403 --> 00:51:35.163]  You wouldn't always know it by watching television.
[00:51:35.163 --> 00:51:36.303]  Yeah, and liars like you.
[00:51:36.303 --> 00:51:42.165]  But overall, most cities are much safer than they were 10 years ago.
[00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:43.605]  I can't believe you just told the truth.
[00:51:43.605 --> 00:51:44.125]  Or 20 years ago.
[00:51:45.953 --> 00:51:54.057]  Now, I challenge the notion that the reason for that is because there's more gun ownership.
[00:51:54.057 --> 00:51:58.819]  Because if you look at where are the areas with the highest gun ownership,
[00:52:00.444 --> 00:52:10.452]  Those are the places, in some cases, where the crime rate hasn't dropped down that much, and the places where there's pretty stiff restrictions on gun ownership.
[00:52:10.452 --> 00:52:14.074]  In some of those places, the crimes dropped really low.
[00:52:14.074 --> 00:52:18.458]  So I'm not sure that there's a one-to-one correlation there.
[00:52:18.458 --> 00:52:18.738]  Oh, really?
[00:52:18.738 --> 00:52:22.801]  Like Kennesaw, Georgia made it the law to own guns, and within one year the crime rate dropped 89%?
[00:52:25.049 --> 00:52:29.950]  Or all the states that passed concealed carries on average had over 25% crime rate within two years?
[00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:30.651]  Some even higher?
[00:52:30.651 --> 00:52:34.392]  I mean, look at crime maps.
[00:52:34.392 --> 00:52:40.613]  The areas where they ban the guns have the highest crime rates in the country and Chicago in the world.
[00:52:40.613 --> 00:52:42.834]  Chicago Tribune.
[00:52:42.834 --> 00:52:45.775]  The city run by you and your mafia scum.
[00:52:48.462 --> 00:52:53.284]  And I know I tear into them, folks, because this is like Hitler in America or Stalin.
[00:52:53.284 --> 00:52:56.825]  I mean, we are in trouble.
[00:52:56.825 --> 00:53:09.211]  I'm going to remind you that I have continued to warn you that they're going to call martial law a civil emergency.
[00:53:09.211 --> 00:53:17.294]  I'm going to remind you that they call it a civil emergency in Germany and Sweden and France with their banning demonstrations against the Islamification and the open borders.
[00:53:18.899 --> 00:53:24.221]  Where they've arrested Le Pen, the leader in the presidential polls, because she said there's a Muslim invasion.
[00:53:24.221 --> 00:53:27.922]  Where they arrest preachers that criticize it mildly in the UK.
[00:53:27.922 --> 00:53:29.402]  It's here.
[00:53:29.402 --> 00:53:30.963]  That's a civil emergency.
[00:53:30.963 --> 00:53:34.384]  They don't call FEMA camps FEMA camps, they call them emergency centers.
[00:53:34.384 --> 00:53:39.145]  They don't call it martial law, they call it state of national emergency.
[00:53:39.145 --> 00:53:44.967]  I have told you thousands of times they will start calling it that when they're getting ready to hammer.
[00:53:47.853 --> 00:53:54.349]  And so now, we have seen scores of articles the last month saying, go ahead and kick Alex Jones off the air, he's dangerous.
[00:53:55.831 --> 00:53:57.672]  Go ahead and shut down free speech.
[00:53:57.672 --> 00:53:58.892]  Go ahead and just take the guns.
[00:53:58.892 --> 00:54:00.253]  Go ahead and start a civil war.
[00:54:00.253 --> 00:54:01.493]  We're using those terms.
[00:54:01.493 --> 00:54:03.374]  Go ahead and be Lincoln on these people.
[00:54:03.374 --> 00:54:16.220]  And here's CNN, victim's father, Obama gun actions won't make a dent, and you read the quotes, CNN op-ed calls for Obama to declare, quote, national state of emergency.
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:18.921]  National state of emergency.
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.341]  National State of Emergency.
[00:54:22.341 --> 00:54:23.582]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:54:23.582 --> 00:54:26.884]  National State of Emergency.
[00:54:26.884 --> 00:54:43.933]  We're under a national state of emergency when they spy on us without warrants, when the president opens the borders outside of law, shuts off our power plants, gives thousands of waivers to insiders on Obamacare, funds Al Qaeda, gives them Stinger missiles, suspends the law, does whatever he wants, has signing statements more than anybody ever.
[00:54:43.933 --> 00:54:47.195]  I mean, we're in martial law, boys and girls.
[00:54:47.195 --> 00:54:47.475]  It's like
[00:54:48.339 --> 00:54:50.036]  We're sitting in the pygmy's pot!
[00:54:51.237 --> 00:54:54.578]  We're sitting in the Globalist's pot.
[00:54:54.578 --> 00:54:57.299]  We're sitting in the Wicked Witch's pot.
[00:54:57.299 --> 00:54:58.720]  And she just started building a fire.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:59.920]  We're like, that smoke smells good.
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.041]  It's kind of warm on my feet in the water.
[00:55:02.041 --> 00:55:03.002]  She's cutting carrots.
[00:55:03.002 --> 00:55:04.202]  She's cutting onions.
[00:55:04.202 --> 00:55:06.303]  You like that, sweetie?
[00:55:06.303 --> 00:55:07.584]  You're going to enjoy it.
[00:55:07.584 --> 00:55:09.684]  And they're sitting there putting broth in.
[00:55:09.684 --> 00:55:10.785]  You're like, man, that's kind of burning.
[00:55:10.785 --> 00:55:13.226]  She's like, let me put the top on.
[00:55:13.226 --> 00:55:14.666]  I'm not putting the top on.
[00:55:14.666 --> 00:55:16.747]  You'll be able to breathe in there.
[00:55:16.747 --> 00:55:19.008]  She's got chains out to chain you inside the pot.
[00:55:19.008 --> 00:55:20.049]  I'm like, get out of the pot!
[00:55:20.049 --> 00:55:20.649]  Get out of the pot!
[00:55:21.129 --> 00:55:22.650]  And you're like, there's no pot!
[00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:24.151]  There's nothing going on!
[00:55:24.151 --> 00:55:25.331]  I love Obamacare!
[00:55:25.331 --> 00:55:30.434]  Man, my medical bills went up!
[00:55:30.434 --> 00:55:34.277]  It's incredible.
[00:55:34.277 --> 00:55:35.337]  So let's go to this clip.
[00:55:35.337 --> 00:55:38.039]  How would government confiscate 350 million guns?
[00:55:39.735 --> 00:55:41.777]  Well, no, they're going to have a whole persecution of gun owners.
[00:55:41.777 --> 00:55:46.661]  They're going to just ban, ban, ban and say, you've got a right to have that single shot.
[00:55:46.661 --> 00:55:52.626]  But, you know, the groups with the semi-autos, they've been connected to the terror attacks on police, the bombing of federal buildings.
[00:55:52.626 --> 00:55:54.708]  We're rounding them up.
[00:55:54.708 --> 00:55:58.131]  And if your city doesn't go along or your state, we're turning the power off.
[00:55:58.131 --> 00:56:06.598]  The main Pentagon training manuals that are public, brigade, homeland, you name it, are to take over the states during, quote, insurrection by the legislatures.
[00:56:07.799 --> 00:56:12.083]  Like the governor, Greg Abbott, coming out and saying, holding up his gun and saying, come and take it.
[00:56:12.083 --> 00:56:13.884]  Texas is not going to turn in the guns.
[00:56:13.884 --> 00:56:16.426]  We're not going to follow unconstitutional executive orders.
[00:56:16.426 --> 00:56:23.032]  Other governors, hundreds of sheriffs, police chiefs, and the globalists are a literal invasion force.
[00:56:23.672 --> 00:56:37.457]  You're living in a movie, folks, who plan an actual war under Jade Helm's scenarios of mastering the human domain, hoping we're so dependent on gadgetry and electricity they can cut it off and make us submit.
[00:56:37.457 --> 00:56:44.399]  The problem is they know the troops aren't going to go along with it.
[00:56:44.399 --> 00:56:47.740]  So they're trying to go to robots and drones and autonomous systems right now.
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:50.701]  But we've got them in check if we just realize we can defeat them.
[00:56:51.451 --> 00:56:53.933]  Thank God for the patriots for 50 years warning us.
[00:56:53.933 --> 00:57:01.160]  Thank God for them working and being persecuted and attacked and IRS and arrested and just beavering away at the enemy.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.783]  The resistance is incredible!
[00:57:03.783 --> 00:57:06.646]  I salute everybody that brought us to this point.
[00:57:06.646 --> 00:57:07.767]  Everything you went through.
[00:57:07.767 --> 00:57:10.289]  I'm nobody compared to what they used to do to people.
[00:57:10.289 --> 00:57:12.431]  50 years ago they'd kill you if you talked about this.
[00:57:13.032 --> 00:57:17.754]  Because America wasn't ready for the truth, and they knew if the folks got the info out, they'd fail.
[00:57:17.754 --> 00:57:20.896]  And so they had persecuted tens of thousands of Americans.
[00:57:20.896 --> 00:57:23.137]  They tortured congressmen like Hanson.
[00:57:23.137 --> 00:57:26.439]  You wouldn't believe it, folks, what they've done to everybody.
[00:57:26.439 --> 00:57:27.660]  It's been hell.
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:36.964]  Giving people cancer, shooting them, setting them up, putting them in jail, IRS, planting pipe bombs on their property.
[00:57:36.964 --> 00:57:38.705]  They changed the policy about 15 years ago.
[00:57:38.705 --> 00:57:39.706]  I used to have them trying to do that to me.
[00:57:40.845 --> 00:57:47.527]  But they just realized they couldn't beat us at that level, so they tried to beat us in a stand-up info war, and we have kicked their butts.
[00:57:47.527 --> 00:57:48.987]  And I'm telling you we're committed!
[00:57:48.987 --> 00:57:51.168]  And people say, man, why do you get so fired up?
[00:57:51.168 --> 00:57:53.929]  This is America going down, we're talking about!
[00:57:53.929 --> 00:58:00.130]  And we got a fighting chance, and I'm in America's corner saying, get in there, focus, and give it everything you got!
[00:58:00.130 --> 00:58:05.252]  Because this isn't a fight about a belt, or a fight for money, or a fight for fame!
[00:58:05.252 --> 00:58:09.833]  It's a fight for our lives, a fight for our futures, it's a death battle!

[00:59:51.343 --> 00:59:53.967]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.121]  Big Brother.
[01:00:13.121 --> 01:00:14.944]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:16.866]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:16.866 --> 01:00:18.548]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:20.190]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:24.695]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.177 --> 01:00:43.361]  Here's a clip where Obama talks about the paranoia of America of some distant enemy as if it was delusional, the tyranny of the British that probably killed more people in history.
[01:00:43.361 --> 01:00:44.461]  I'm not bashing the British.
[01:00:44.461 --> 01:00:46.422]  I'm obviously part English.
[01:00:46.422 --> 01:00:51.004]  But they were a dominant empire that made the Roman Empire look, look, sweetie cake.
[01:00:51.004 --> 01:00:53.025]  And people rebelled in England.
[01:00:53.025 --> 01:00:53.645]  They rebelled here.
[01:00:54.807 --> 01:00:56.709]  And so Obama kind of halfway attacks it.
[01:00:56.709 --> 01:01:03.658]  But then you got him last year at West Point saying, I'm sick of hearing about tyranny always around the corner and you don't trust your government, you're going to have a problem.
[01:01:03.658 --> 01:01:09.967]  Well, if it isn't my government and it's waging war on me, I'd be a moron to bend over.
[01:01:12.014 --> 01:01:16.480]  All these billionaires that are tax-exempt telling me to turn my guns in while they got bodyguards?
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.781]  Shut up!
[01:01:17.781 --> 01:01:19.063]  I see right through you, man!
[01:01:19.063 --> 01:01:20.685]  Come on, stop lying to me!
[01:01:20.685 --> 01:01:24.410]  I'm not one of your little gibbering slaves that can't even hardly walk!
[01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:26.492]  Or talk!
[01:01:26.492 --> 01:01:28.154]  Stop trying to conquer us, scum!
[01:01:28.154 --> 01:01:30.778]  Now let's go ahead...
[01:01:33.615 --> 01:01:39.704]  And go to this clip where Mark Kelly, earlier Obama, talks about the conspiracy to get our guns and we go, yeah, there is a conspiracy.
[01:01:39.704 --> 01:01:41.547]  Very bizarre double speak.
[01:01:41.547 --> 01:01:44.311]  But here's Mark Kelly and then I've got Obama earlier at West Point.
[01:01:44.311 --> 01:01:44.531]  Here it is.
[01:01:45.949 --> 01:01:58.315]  Often what you hear in the debate of expanding background checks to more gun sales, and as you know, Gabby and I are 100% behind the concept of somebody getting a background check before buying a gun.
[01:01:58.315 --> 01:01:59.856]  The shooter's all due background checks!
[01:01:59.856 --> 01:02:03.277]  We testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[01:02:03.277 --> 01:02:07.819]  We heard not only from the gun lobby, but from United States Senators.
[01:02:07.819 --> 01:02:09.700]  They keep trying to act reasonable.
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.261]  Calling for stuff they've already got.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:17.869]  Will lead to a registry, which will lead to confiscation, which will lead to a tyrannical government.
[01:02:17.869 --> 01:02:18.090]  Yes.
[01:02:19.079 --> 01:02:41.740]  So I would like you to explain, with 350 million guns in 65 million places, households, from Key West to Alaska, 350 million objects in 65 million places, if the federal government wanted to confiscate those objects, how would they do that?
[01:02:42.614 --> 01:02:45.915]  What I think Mark is alluding to is what I said earlier.
[01:02:45.915 --> 01:02:53.838]  This notion of a conspiracy out there and it gets wrapped up in concerns about the federal government.
[01:02:53.838 --> 01:02:56.179]  Now, there's a long history of that.
[01:02:56.179 --> 01:02:58.580]  That's in our DNA.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:04.082]  The United States was born suspicious of some distant authority.
[01:03:04.724 --> 01:03:08.167]  That's why it turned out to be the most successful, because it wasn't a bunch of chumps.
[01:03:08.167 --> 01:03:14.972]  A nation of sheep will be ruled by people like you, wolves, and your trillionaire boyfriend, Anderson Cooper.
[01:03:14.972 --> 01:03:16.513]  I mean, just literally, folks.
[01:03:16.513 --> 01:03:25.600]  I mean, these people are just scum, because they're social engineering and class warfaring all day, when they're the richest people in the world!
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.443]  Tax-exempt filth!
[01:03:29.443 --> 01:03:30.744]  I'm sorry.
[01:03:30.744 --> 01:03:32.285]  Now, let's go to Obama at West Point.
[01:03:33.544 --> 01:03:34.965]  We're really getting into hell.
[01:03:34.965 --> 01:03:36.545]  How dare you say tyranny is around the corner?
[01:03:36.545 --> 01:03:40.587]  Here it is.
[01:03:40.587 --> 01:03:50.270]  Hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:54.572]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[01:03:54.572 --> 01:03:59.913]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[01:03:59.913 --> 01:04:00.994]  You should reject these voices.
[01:04:02.694 --> 01:04:04.295]  And by the way, that was Ohio State.
[01:04:04.295 --> 01:04:07.257]  I just had to find the West Point clip where he says it, and they found that one.
[01:04:07.257 --> 01:04:07.798]  That's right.
[01:04:07.798 --> 01:04:08.679]  There's a bunch of them.
[01:04:08.679 --> 01:04:14.563]  And there's clips where he says, I just can't be a dictator and do whatever I want outside of Congress on guns.
[01:04:14.563 --> 01:04:15.524]  They got to do it.
[01:04:15.524 --> 01:04:21.348]  Now he's saying, oh, we are.
[01:04:21.348 --> 01:04:23.850]  Now, when we come back, I've got
[01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:33.096]  Obama warning of executive power grabs with Bush and how he's a constitutional lawyer and he knows what's bad versus what he's doing now.
[01:04:33.096 --> 01:04:34.978]  And then we have a clip of some of his lies.
[01:04:34.978 --> 01:04:39.062]  Very small group of them because it would take hours to cover them all, literally.
[01:04:39.062 --> 01:04:43.306]  I keep using the word literally because, I mean, for real, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:43.866 --> 01:04:51.075]  And then we've got Stefan Molyneux on the gigantor rape fest.
[01:04:51.075 --> 01:04:53.238]  Now we've learned it's much worse than we thought in Europe.
[01:04:53.238 --> 01:04:57.504]  The police are actively covering up the rape holiday the jihadis are having.
[01:04:59.071 --> 01:05:06.636]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com, overflow crowd for Donald Trump in Bernie Sanders' backyard, article left by the New York Times.
[01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:18.664]  Donald J. Trump touchdown in one of America's most progressive cities Thursday night, bringing the bombastic message that has captivated Republican voters into the backyard of a Democratic opponent.
[01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:21.706]  Senator Bernie, let's give it all away, Sanders of Vermont.
[01:05:22.006 --> 01:05:41.151]  This visit came as the billionaire real estate mogul has made a point of broadening his focus beyond the early primary states, showcasing his popularity with packed rallies from Mississippi to Massachusetts, and now Vermont, a one-time Republican bastion that is now one of the most solid liberal states in the nation.
[01:05:41.331 --> 01:05:46.914]  The choice of venue seemed curious to some, but Thursday's rally served multiple purposes for the Trump campaign.
[01:05:46.914 --> 01:05:54.359]  Needling Mr. Sanders in his own neighborhood, garnering attention in nearby New Hampshire, which holds the nation's first primary next month.
[01:05:54.359 --> 01:05:57.240]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.401]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[01:05:58.401 --> 01:06:01.903]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:06:01.903 --> 01:06:06.886]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:06:06.886 --> 01:06:07.186]  We're good.
[01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:29.352]  Brain Force is here.
[01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:31.553]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:06:31.553 --> 01:06:36.536]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:06:36.536 --> 01:06:39.839]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:06:39.839 --> 01:06:43.321]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:06:43.321 --> 01:06:45.062]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:06:45.282 --> 01:06:45.362]  It's
[01:07:04.386 --> 01:07:07.150]  Steal billions of dollars of their money.
[01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:13.658]  And it's all possible because in the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[01:07:13.658 --> 01:07:15.340]  The numbers are staggering.
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:21.908]  In the past five years alone, 41 billion dollars of consumer gift cards went completely unspent.
[01:07:22.048 --> 01:07:25.591]  That's $41 billion taken directly from our back pockets.
[01:07:25.591 --> 01:07:26.952]  Don't let them win.

[01:08:09.918 --> 01:08:11.799]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:08:11.799 --> 01:08:23.027]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:23.027 --> 01:08:31.833]  What is Obama doing right now?
[01:08:31.833 --> 01:08:33.574]  He's breaking the law.
[01:08:33.574 --> 01:08:37.496]  Breaking the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence.
[01:08:37.496 --> 01:08:39.578]  He's said countless times as President,
[01:08:41.041 --> 01:08:52.064]  And before he was president, that presidents circumventing Congress with executive actions that mimic laws is very dangerous and tyrannical.
[01:08:52.064 --> 01:08:54.885]  But now we have a blackmailed Supreme Court.
[01:08:54.885 --> 01:09:08.650]  We have an intimidated Congress working with the neocon rhino Republicans who wrote Obamacare and all these other screw jobs, opening our borders, flooding us with all these populations to be new socialist client state people.
[01:09:08.650 --> 01:09:09.450]  We're in deep trouble.
[01:09:10.942 --> 01:09:16.403]  And in the last hour, I played clips of Obama saying, is there a conspiracy to take your guns?
[01:09:16.403 --> 01:09:17.924]  Well, yeah, there's a conspiracy.
[01:09:17.924 --> 01:09:21.945]  Very bizarre statement with Anderson Cooper.
[01:09:21.945 --> 01:09:26.806]  And saying, you know, these websites out there that say martial law is coming.
[01:09:26.806 --> 01:09:27.886]  Well, look right here.
[01:09:27.886 --> 01:09:34.548]  CNN op-ed calls for Obama to declare national state of emergency to gut the Second Amendment.
[01:09:34.548 --> 01:09:39.489]  And we've seen the Daily Beast, Salon, and countless other groups directly connected to the White House.
[01:09:41.067 --> 01:09:44.308]  Putting the talking point out about a civil emergency.
[01:09:44.308 --> 01:09:50.531]  And that is a civil emergency when the President just says, I don't need Congress.
[01:09:50.531 --> 01:09:51.911]  I'll shut down power plants.
[01:09:51.911 --> 01:09:52.612]  I don't need Congress.
[01:09:52.612 --> 01:09:53.732]  I'll just bring illegals in.
[01:09:53.732 --> 01:09:54.632]  Congress won't act.
[01:09:54.632 --> 01:09:56.473]  I played the clip yesterday.
[01:09:56.473 --> 01:09:58.434]  They won't get in line, so I'm taking action.
[01:09:59.397 --> 01:10:03.681]  And folks, when they're done, they'll take everything down to revolvers, down to single shots.
[01:10:03.681 --> 01:10:04.862]  They've done it everywhere else.
[01:10:04.862 --> 01:10:07.004]  They've done it in every city they control.
[01:10:07.004 --> 01:10:09.847]  But they're going to have taxpayer bodyguards.
[01:10:09.847 --> 01:10:19.657]  The rich Hollywood types, they're going to have the armored car that parks down the street, the armed defense company that Piers Morgan had in L.A.
[01:10:19.657 --> 01:10:22.619]  Turned out the bills were something like eight grand a month.
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:33.727]  From the time he got home during the day until he got up and left, 12 to 14 hours a day, an armored car with guys with submachine guns and shotguns.
[01:10:33.727 --> 01:10:39.091]  But he wants your guns!
[01:10:39.091 --> 01:10:41.293]  I mean, oh, but no one wants your guns!
[01:10:41.293 --> 01:10:42.294]  No one's coming for your guns!
[01:10:45.492 --> 01:10:53.339]  And then all these bizarre statements about, well, it's in our DNA, you know, to be fearful of some foreign removed group.
[01:10:53.339 --> 01:10:57.723]  Yeah, that would press you into slavery on a ship as a... I mean, it went on and on.
[01:10:57.723 --> 01:11:01.686]  That would not let you have a letter to do business unless you were an insider.
[01:11:01.686 --> 01:11:04.348]  I mean, so many hundreds of corrupt things under the British Crown.
[01:11:05.109 --> 01:11:08.790]  That the whole world was revolting against, including in England at the time.
[01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:10.311]  And then just Obama, it's all a joke.
[01:11:10.311 --> 01:11:13.772]  I played those clips last hour, but I'm going to play two clips and go to our guest.
[01:11:13.772 --> 01:11:24.776]  And it ties into all of this because we've had another radical jihadi, we'll put it up on screen, run up and shoot a police officer on video saying he did it for Islam.
[01:11:24.776 --> 01:11:28.137]  Photo show gunman shooting Philly cop in the name of Islam.
[01:11:28.137 --> 01:11:30.057]  Religion of peace strikes again.
[01:11:30.057 --> 01:11:30.918]  Shocking moment.
[01:11:30.918 --> 01:11:32.838]  The police officer says shots fired.
[01:11:32.838 --> 01:11:33.399]  I'm shot.
[01:11:33.399 --> 01:11:34.259]  I'm bleeding heavily.
[01:11:38.052 --> 01:11:45.096]  Harnett is heard yelling on police radio, and a guy in a Muslim outfit runs up, shoots him.
[01:11:45.096 --> 01:11:48.037]  And this is what MSNBC and George Soros are pushing.
[01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:58.323]  And then when they do this, when they import people from the third world who all kill each other, the worst radical Muslim areas, they say, you gotta turn your guns in now because we're getting hit by radical Islam.
[01:11:59.229 --> 01:12:02.733]  And they call the San Bernardino attack, you know, a right-wing shooting for two days.
[01:12:02.733 --> 01:12:03.333]  Remember?
[01:12:03.333 --> 01:12:04.795]  Ordering the FBI to lie.
[01:12:04.795 --> 01:12:07.437]  And it turns out the FBI was on these folks two years before.
[01:12:07.437 --> 01:12:13.864]  They were going to training camps, and then they were investigated for being racist by the Justice Department.
[01:12:13.864 --> 01:12:18.329]  They want to bring the jihadis in who aren't compatible anywhere in the world, including their own countries.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.521]  I mean, these are the scum of the Middle East going to rape and kill in Syria.
[01:12:22.521 --> 01:12:23.602]  They got their butts kicked.
[01:12:23.602 --> 01:12:29.144]  They run into Europe through Turkey, their ally, and then come right in and Merkel says, rape and kill whoever you want.
[01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:33.905]  I've got stacks of news now where the police are actually admitting they were ordered to cover it up.
[01:12:33.905 --> 01:12:35.826]  Mass rapes, beatings, killings.
[01:12:35.826 --> 01:12:37.347]  I mean, this is nuts.
[01:12:37.347 --> 01:12:44.209]  And then they use the crisis to declare states of emergency in Europe and take their rights just like they're getting ready to do here.
[01:12:44.209 --> 01:12:45.590]  They'll never call it martial law.
[01:12:47.386 --> 01:12:48.227]  Refugee crisis.
[01:12:48.227 --> 01:12:49.728]  Why aren't Gulf states taking them in?
[01:12:49.728 --> 01:12:52.409]  Because they are the criminals at others.
[01:12:52.409 --> 01:12:58.013]  They just show the few women here and there like they're so sweet to sell the idea, but it's 80 plus percent military age men.
[01:12:58.013 --> 01:13:00.134]  Now I'm going to stop there.
[01:13:00.134 --> 01:13:12.883]  Let's go to this clip, this compilation of Obama before he was a president and when he was a president saying you can't have executive orders outside of Congress that deal with major law and policy versus what he's doing now.
[01:13:12.883 --> 01:13:13.223]  Here it is.
[01:13:14.827 --> 01:13:19.131]  I will close Guantanamo, I will restore habeas corpus.
[01:13:19.131 --> 01:13:20.633]  Guantanamo, that's easy.
[01:13:20.633 --> 01:13:23.655]  Close down Guantanamo, restore habeas corpus.
[01:13:23.655 --> 01:13:27.319]  The last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class.
[01:13:27.319 --> 01:13:31.343]  You will not see your taxes increase one single dime.
[01:13:31.343 --> 01:13:35.647]  You will not see your taxes increase a single dime.
[01:13:36.227 --> 01:13:41.352]  Now, that's from the lie clip from Obama deception.
[01:13:41.352 --> 01:13:42.874]  We're going to go to the other one now.
[01:13:42.874 --> 01:13:46.457]  This is the group of clips on Obama on executive power.
[01:13:46.457 --> 01:13:46.757]  Here it is.
[01:13:47.577 --> 01:13:58.866]  There's been a tendency on the part of this administration to try to hide behind executive privilege every time there's something a little shaky that's taking place.
[01:13:58.866 --> 01:14:03.650]  And I think the administration would be best served by coming clean on this.
[01:14:03.650 --> 01:14:06.953]  It's not actually true that the Patriot Act was the worst.
[01:14:06.953 --> 01:14:11.336]  Most of the problems that we have had in civil liberties were not done through the Patriot Act.
[01:14:11.336 --> 01:14:14.379]  They were done through executive order by George W. Bush.
[01:14:14.379 --> 01:14:15.340]  And I think one of the biggest
[01:14:17.568 --> 01:14:24.294]  The problems of the last eight years has been the degree to which President Bush has taken almost the opposite tack.
[01:14:24.294 --> 01:14:32.461]  That secrecy and concentrations of power in the Oval Office.
[01:14:32.461 --> 01:14:34.843]  I taught the Constitution for ten years.
[01:14:34.843 --> 01:14:38.907]  I believe in the Constitution and I will obey the Constitution of the United States.
[01:14:38.907 --> 01:14:43.350]  We're not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an end run around Congress.
[01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.651]  Alright?
[01:14:45.202 --> 01:14:48.225]  And I'm going to play the lie compilation later while our guest is on with us.
[01:14:48.225 --> 01:14:49.346]  I want to get started with that.
[01:14:49.346 --> 01:15:00.297]  And then we can actually go to his clip from Monday where he says, I'm a constitutional lawyer and I know I can do these executive orders because Congress won't get in line.
[01:15:00.297 --> 01:15:00.778]  That's a quote.
[01:15:02.366 --> 01:15:03.706]  I mean, this is so naked.
[01:15:03.706 --> 01:15:05.587]  I wonder what's coming next.
[01:15:05.587 --> 01:15:07.827]  I mean, this is really getting bizarro land.
[01:15:07.827 --> 01:15:14.348]  And he's clearly responding to us, Drudge and others, where he goes, these websites claiming we want martial law, claiming we want to take your guns.
[01:15:14.348 --> 01:15:15.169]  Is there conspiracy?
[01:15:15.169 --> 01:15:16.949]  Well, yeah, we want to stop the problem.
[01:15:16.949 --> 01:15:17.769]  I guess there is.
[01:15:17.769 --> 01:15:19.449]  I mean, it's getting really weird.
[01:15:19.449 --> 01:15:28.171]  And then you tie into this the massive Muslim influx from areas that are run by radicals who can't even live in peace with each other.
[01:15:28.171 --> 01:15:31.372]  I mean, if they rape a woman, then they kill the woman.
[01:15:32.571 --> 01:15:33.672]  So that's the view of women.
[01:15:33.672 --> 01:15:37.175]  And the feminists in Germany are saying it's white German men's fault.
[01:15:37.175 --> 01:15:38.136]  They actually say this.
[01:15:38.136 --> 01:15:40.058]  It's bizarre.
[01:15:40.058 --> 01:15:42.460]  Cologne sex attack suspects found with note.
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:44.382]  I kill you, I want to have sex with you.
[01:15:44.382 --> 01:15:47.425]  And they hand this to the women.
[01:15:47.425 --> 01:15:49.987]  Unprecedented sex harassment in Helsinki at New Year's.
[01:15:49.987 --> 01:15:52.910]  Finished police report.
[01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:54.872]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:15:54.872 --> 01:15:57.394]  Cologne suspects include 18 asylum seekers.
[01:15:58.493 --> 01:16:02.284]  Afghan woman barbarically lynched after being falsely accused of burning Koran.
[01:16:03.496 --> 01:16:06.317]  German refugee numbers rise, so do rapes.
[01:16:06.317 --> 01:16:10.697]  Two teenage girls gang-raped by four Syrian nationals in southern Germany.
[01:16:10.697 --> 01:16:13.098]  Severely beaten, noses broken.
[01:16:13.098 --> 01:16:15.118]  Well, that's the sacrament of the liberals.
[01:16:15.118 --> 01:16:19.479]  Suspects in Cologne's sex attacks claim to be Syrian refugees.
[01:16:19.479 --> 01:16:21.439]  Merkel comes out and says you gotta accept them.
[01:16:21.439 --> 01:16:22.640]  There's actual video of it.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.300]  And the mayor says you need to learn to fight back or not dress so sexy.
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:27.861]  She actually said that.
[01:16:27.861 --> 01:16:28.841]  You need to keep them off you.
[01:16:30.063 --> 01:16:33.187]  Now, a German does that, he gets 20 years in prison.
[01:16:33.187 --> 01:16:33.888]  Starts to rape you.
[01:16:33.888 --> 01:16:36.110]  But hey, that's a white guy.
[01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:37.031]  ISIS in Syria.
[01:16:37.031 --> 01:16:41.096]  Mother publicly executed by her jihad son for abandoning Islam.
[01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:42.638]  I'm sure that's America's fault.
[01:16:42.638 --> 01:16:43.679]  Merkel flashback.
[01:16:43.679 --> 01:16:45.702]  Germans have to accept migrant crime wave.
[01:16:45.702 --> 01:16:46.303]  Actually says it.
[01:16:46.303 --> 01:16:47.624]  Actually says they have to accept crime.
[01:16:49.045 --> 01:16:53.488]  Europe is committing a demographic and cultural suicide.
[01:16:53.488 --> 01:17:03.834]  I'm going to stop right there, but to talk about the big picture for this segment, the gun grab, all of it, Stefan Molyneux, and then at the bottom of the hour, we'll keep a little bit in the next, and then our next guest is coming on.
[01:17:03.834 --> 01:17:08.137]  We're going to look at the history, because I saw a great viral video he did we're going to tell you about.
[01:17:08.137 --> 01:17:12.420]  We're going to post it on Infowars.com, by the way, right now, and tweet it out at RealAlexJones.
[01:17:13.547 --> 01:17:17.910]  Dealing with the real history of slavery, Christian and Muslim.
[01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:21.753]  Both groups are guilty, but the other group's about four times worse from my estimate.
[01:17:21.753 --> 01:17:25.256]  And then also, who really started the more modern one?
[01:17:25.256 --> 01:17:28.799]  After Rome fell, and more importantly, the Crusades.
[01:17:28.799 --> 01:17:30.200]  We always heard it was an invasion.
[01:17:32.532 --> 01:17:36.035]  Okay, that's just, I mean, I'm a history guy too.
[01:17:36.035 --> 01:17:38.177]  It's all well known, it's riveting stuff.
[01:17:38.177 --> 01:17:41.380]  The Muslims are very proud of the fact that they started it all.
[01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:49.387]  You know, and now the Canadian government, when it welcomes and plays the jihad anthem in Canada, you know, about the great conquering of Constantinople.
[01:17:49.387 --> 01:17:52.709]  So joining us is fellow throt criminal, Stefan Molyneux.
[01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:58.637]  Host and founder of Free Domain Radio and reaches hundreds of millions of people.
[01:17:58.637 --> 01:18:01.040]  YouTube.com forward slash Free Domain Radio.
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.562]  Twitter, Stefan Molyneux.
[01:18:02.562 --> 01:18:04.425]  Free Domain Radio dot com.
[01:18:04.425 --> 01:18:05.186]  And he joins us.
[01:18:05.186 --> 01:18:06.287]  I'm going to skip this break.
[01:18:06.287 --> 01:18:07.449]  Last one of the week, I promise.
[01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:07.989]  I'm out of control.
[01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:10.791]  Hey, who wants to just blow thousands of dollars, whatever.
[01:18:10.791 --> 01:18:15.993]  Point is, support us folks, buy stuff at Infowarsstore.com, GCNlive.com, support the sponsors.
[01:18:15.993 --> 01:18:17.854]  But I just had to skip this to give them more time.
[01:18:17.854 --> 01:18:21.196]  Stefan, this is reaching insane asylum level.
[01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:23.437]  What do you think the cultural elite are trying to do?
[01:18:23.437 --> 01:18:25.317]  Because clearly, it's an organized plan.
[01:18:25.317 --> 01:18:26.958]  It's the same thing in Europe, same thing here.
[01:18:26.958 --> 01:18:30.160]  I mean, has common sense been suspended?
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:35.442]  Because they don't get in trouble when they bring in 3 million refugees and they start burning, murdering, and killing.
[01:18:35.442 --> 01:18:36.542]  They get more power.
[01:18:36.542 --> 01:18:37.783]  I mean, what's happening here?
[01:18:38.971 --> 01:18:45.082]  Well, you know, first of all, I just want to say Happy New Year to you and your listeners and to say that it sort of feels like for me...
[01:18:45.965 --> 01:19:05.298]  Three decades of preparation is coming down to one and only one year and that is this year where the maximum effort must be put out to reach people with ideas of liberty and voluntarism and freedom and so on because it seems like events are accelerating at a crazy snowball fashion and now is the time where we really need to stand tall and push back.
[01:19:05.298 --> 01:19:12.543]  It feels to me like it's all coming down to this year and the migrant crisis in Europe is one of the great aspects of that.
[01:19:12.543 --> 01:19:15.084]  It is not a bunch of migrants fleeing war.
[01:19:16.148 --> 01:19:17.843]  The closest European country.
[01:19:18.399 --> 01:19:22.982]  to Syria is Cyprus, just a couple of dozen miles off the coast.
[01:19:22.982 --> 01:19:25.284]  And the refugees are not going to Cyprus.
[01:19:25.284 --> 01:19:25.524]  Why?
[01:19:25.524 --> 01:19:28.986]  Because Cyprus will not allow the refugees to bring in family members.
[01:19:28.986 --> 01:19:40.114]  The million that Angela Merkel has invited into Germany are merely the tip of the spear because they're going to be family reunification policies that allow them to bring in millions and millions more.
[01:19:40.114 --> 01:19:46.839]  Lithuania has a small welfare state and Lithuania has thrown its gates wide to invite these migrants in and they're not
[01:19:47.359 --> 01:19:48.580]  Going to Lithuania.
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:51.841]  They're hip-hopping over many countries where they're not under threat.
[01:19:51.841 --> 01:19:55.963]  They say Merkel has invited us, everything's going to be free.
[01:19:55.963 --> 01:20:03.406]  They're the tow hooks, they're the launch cables when the pirates come to your ship, they're the anchor people to bring in the next mega-wave.
[01:20:03.406 --> 01:20:05.167]  Please continue.
[01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:07.748]  Well, so that's really, really important to understand.
[01:20:07.748 --> 01:20:12.891]  And we don't have the historical view of Islam that is characterized by the history of the Crusades.
[01:20:13.675 --> 01:20:17.238]  Christianity was a Middle Eastern religion.
[01:20:17.238 --> 01:20:20.500]  European religions are like the old Norse religions with Ragnarok and so on.
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.802]  Christianity is a Middle Eastern religion.
[01:20:22.802 --> 01:20:26.064]  And how many Christian countries are there left in the Middle East?
[01:20:26.064 --> 01:20:29.967]  Accounting, like, if you accept a little bit in Lebanon, none.
[01:20:29.967 --> 01:20:30.528]  Because...
[01:20:32.015 --> 01:20:35.958]  Islam is a radical expansionist ideology.
[01:20:35.958 --> 01:20:41.723]  To say that Islam is a religion is like saying communism is an economic system.
[01:20:41.723 --> 01:20:42.924]  It is not true.
[01:20:42.924 --> 01:20:47.888]  Islam is a combination of religion and a highly expansionist political ideology.
[01:20:47.888 --> 01:20:50.050]  And highly expansionist is putting it mildly.
[01:20:50.050 --> 01:20:54.254]  Saying that Islam is somewhat expansionist is saying like a supernova is somewhat expansionist.
[01:20:55.047 --> 01:20:57.488]  Islam, of course, in the 7th century was founded.
[01:20:57.488 --> 01:21:01.750]  By the end of the 7th century, it had taken over most of North Africa and all of the Middle East.
[01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:04.511]  It is an incredibly expansionist ideology.
[01:21:04.511 --> 01:21:07.733]  It seeks one-world domination, just as communism did.
[01:21:07.733 --> 01:21:12.055]  And the fact is that, of course, the first couple of Muslims are going to be nice, because they have to wait to get
[01:21:12.675 --> 01:21:28.068]  The numbers up in order to begin to affect the kind of social change when the Islamists first got their toeholds and then entire countries taken over in Europe, it took over 700 years of brutal medieval battle to drive
[01:21:28.448 --> 01:21:31.310]  The Islamic population out of Europe.
[01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:37.434]  And the Islamists, of course, were taking millions of Europeans, mostly through piracy, into the slave trade.
[01:21:37.434 --> 01:21:46.439]  The Islamists have 14 centuries of the slave trade, but the death count that has been estimated at over a hundred and ten million souls.
[01:21:46.439 --> 01:21:48.181]  So, it is important to know your history.
[01:21:48.181 --> 01:21:50.482]  And let's just show a fact here to show how deep this invasion went.
[01:21:50.482 --> 01:21:54.405]  And of course, they'll call this racist just to give a cultural
[01:21:55.265 --> 01:21:56.086]  Point.
[01:21:56.086 --> 01:22:03.294]  That's why Southern Italy, Greece, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, Spain is no longer blonde-haired, blue-eyed.
[01:22:03.294 --> 01:22:06.978]  All the way up into Poland, that's how far the invasions went.
[01:22:06.978 --> 01:22:10.742]  In Poland, in Hungary, I mean millions dying, giant
[01:22:11.002 --> 01:22:12.483]  Full out wars.
[01:22:12.483 --> 01:22:15.785]  And when the Muslims came in, they would kill all the men, even if they converted.
[01:22:15.785 --> 01:22:19.848]  At first, the Christians didn't care and weren't fighting back.
[01:22:19.848 --> 01:22:26.412]  But the Muslims were killing everybody, putting them to the sword, loading the women into slave ships.
[01:22:26.412 --> 01:22:28.474]  And that's all in mainline history.
[01:22:28.474 --> 01:22:30.055]  The Muslims celebrate it.
[01:22:30.055 --> 01:22:33.817]  Their imams say, we're coming for your women now, weak scum.
[01:22:33.817 --> 01:22:36.859]  And the socialist left says, yes, come.
[01:22:36.859 --> 01:22:40.282]  I want to ask you, why does the socialist left want to
[01:22:41.162 --> 01:22:42.124]  I mean, Europe's already dead.
[01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:43.246]  It's already not having kids.
[01:22:43.246 --> 01:22:45.770]  I mean, why not replace it with Brazilians or something?
[01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:49.877]  Why do you want to replace it with not even the less radical Muslims?
[01:22:49.877 --> 01:22:51.539]  Why bring in the absolute scum?
[01:22:52.748 --> 01:23:08.140]  Well, this goes all the way back to Trotsky and the origins of the Communist Party in Russia and the desire of the communists and the leftists to take over the world, to destroy capitalism, to destroy free markets, to destroy limited constitutional republics.
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:15.286]  That is the thorn in the side of socialism, the fact that socialist countries do badly economically and capitalist or more free market countries do very well.
[01:23:15.806 --> 01:23:16.166]  We're good to go.
[01:23:34.754 --> 01:23:43.756]  And the idea was to jam as many radically incompatible cultures into Europe and North America as humanly possible, and then watch the civil wars erupt.
[01:23:43.756 --> 01:23:48.917]  And that was what was going to destroy the remnants of freedom in the West, which has been their goal for coming on a century.
[01:23:48.917 --> 01:23:51.397]  And they admit it, they write books on it, and here we are.
[01:23:51.397 --> 01:23:53.398]  So timeframe, how's it going for them?
[01:23:53.398 --> 01:24:00.059]  And then let's get into the history of what really happened with the Crusades, and then what expansionist Islam is.
[01:24:01.052 --> 01:24:03.893]  Well, the time frame is that they're doing very well.
[01:24:03.893 --> 01:24:10.016]  Hopefully, with people like us to stand up and fight against that particular approach, we'll be able to stop them.
[01:24:10.016 --> 01:24:11.616]  But their time frame is that it's going very well.
[01:24:11.616 --> 01:24:24.682]  Of course, Angela Merkel decided to allow these million Muslim, quote, refugees, although the vast majority of them are young military-age men, who are not fleeing from war-torn countries, but simply looking for the welfare state.
[01:24:24.682 --> 01:24:27.263]  She invited them in, of course, by disobeying the law.
[01:24:27.583 --> 01:24:31.584]  The law is in Europe that you have to seek asylum in the first country you get to.
[01:24:31.584 --> 01:24:34.445]  You can't leapfrog to get to the country that you want.
[01:24:34.445 --> 01:24:43.888]  She changed that rule and she allowed migrants into Germany to appeal for asylum without having to go through the stop at the first country they got to.
[01:24:43.888 --> 01:24:54.891]  So this is why people are pouring into Germany and this is why it's the young military-age men who, if they were Europeans as in World War II, would be staying to fight the dictatorships in their own country rather than fleeing and attempting to spread
[01:24:55.592 --> 01:25:08.050]  A fairly vile Sharia-based ideology to the rest of the West, but their acceleration is going beautifully, and it is only a few truth-tellers who stand between this process and the end of Western civilization.
[01:25:09.344 --> 01:25:22.061]  And the socialists and communists and social engineers hate the West so much because it stood in the way of their total control that they would join with radical Islam, which will slit their throat in a second.
[01:25:22.061 --> 01:25:24.885]  But I guess they don't care because they think it'll take another generation or so.
[01:25:24.885 --> 01:25:26.227]  They just want to see Europe fall.
[01:25:27.168 --> 01:25:33.132]  Well, I'm sure you are aware of this, but the human lust for power, Alex, is a physical addiction.
[01:25:33.132 --> 01:25:36.895]  It releases the same kind of dopamine that you get out of cocaine and so on.
[01:25:36.895 --> 01:25:53.966]  So saying, well, gee, I don't know what their endgame is, these globalists or whatever, is like saying, well, I don't know why this cocaine addict is acting irrationally, because they just want their next fix, their next expansion of power, their next gun grab, their next escalation of some sort of regulation, their next
[01:25:54.546 --> 01:25:56.387]  Reduction of human liberty.
[01:25:56.387 --> 01:25:57.567]  It's an addiction.
[01:25:57.567 --> 01:26:03.748]  And they can't be counted on to stop it themselves any more than most addicts in the late stage of their addiction can do it.
[01:26:03.748 --> 01:26:05.469]  They're hungering for their next fix.
[01:26:05.469 --> 01:26:10.250]  They're not thinking beyond the next five minutes of another power grab to feed their addiction.
[01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:11.610]  Hence the word power-hungry.
[01:26:11.610 --> 01:26:17.612]  You look at George Soros, a Nazi collaborator, was an arch-war criminal by, you know, 15 years old.
[01:26:17.612 --> 01:26:21.352]  A string of evil, overthrowing countries, impoverishing people.
[01:26:21.352 --> 01:26:23.553]  All he ever does is evil things.
[01:26:24.214 --> 01:26:28.348]  And it's just so sick that they actually get off on this.
[01:26:29.838 --> 01:26:30.098]  Right.
[01:26:30.098 --> 01:26:38.325]  So I wanted to mention, of course, that the analogy that kind of struck me just before the show was that a tree without roots can be easily pushed over.
[01:26:38.325 --> 01:26:59.582]  And this, I think, is one of the reasons why the leftists, academics, and in particular the myth makers, the artists and the Hollywood types and so on, have created the myth of the evil, patriarchal, racist, slave-owning, white, Western, Christian, European civilization that you're taught to hate everything about your past and then you have nothing to defend when an antithetical culture
[01:26:59.582 --> 01:26:59.682]  Sure.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:26.283]  That the Crusades were fought, but it was not an invasion of the Middle East.
[01:27:26.283 --> 01:27:29.205]  It was a defense of Europe against Islamic invasions.
[01:27:29.205 --> 01:27:37.731]  When three out of the five Christian centers had fallen into Islamic hands, when the Islamists were at the gates of Vienna, that is when the pushback occurred.
[01:27:37.731 --> 01:27:45.516]  But this idea that, you know, these bloodthirsty Christians went along to these innocent Muslims who were just minding their own business and tending their chickens and just started slaughtering them,
[01:27:46.056 --> 01:27:51.539]  For fun and kittens, makes no sense and is historically completely inaccurate.
[01:27:51.539 --> 01:28:01.144]  Islam's goal was to conquer Europe, Islam's goal was being achieved and the Christians under the guidance of the Pope finally said Deus Vult and began to fight back.
[01:28:01.144 --> 01:28:04.786]  But it was a defensive war, it was not fundamentally a war of imperialism.
[01:28:06.209 --> 01:28:07.650]  And that's, that's not debated.
[01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:11.271]  For folks that don't know, I mean, Islamic TV books, they all celebrate this.
[01:28:11.271 --> 01:28:13.272]  And then they say, that's the gold takeover again.
[01:28:13.272 --> 01:28:16.894]  And you will convert or be put to the sword.
[01:28:16.894 --> 01:28:22.757]  And then the left just runs around lying, saying it's racist to say that this is being done.
[01:28:24.079 --> 01:28:32.310]  Well, and I think that in Europe they abandoned Christianity and did not replace it with any comparable moral guidance.
[01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:39.720]  And so what's happened is I think that a lot of the European secularists have failed and no longer fundamentally understand
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:44.461]  The fundamentalist religious mindset, such as is occurring in many places in the Middle East.
[01:28:44.461 --> 01:28:56.245]  They don't understand that there are lots of people in the world who have plans and ambitions that far supersede the sort of shallow materialistic pleasure-seeking that most secular post-religious societies tend to fall into.
[01:28:56.245 --> 01:28:56.805]  So they're blind!
[01:28:56.805 --> 01:29:01.647]  And so they say, well, you know, if we got to Europe, we'd be happy to just get a job and be nice and so on.
[01:29:01.647 --> 01:29:02.647]  They do not understand
[01:29:03.187 --> 01:29:05.670]  And by the way, you just hit on it.
[01:29:05.670 --> 01:29:07.131]  There is this weird perverted sexual stuff in
[01:29:20.243 --> 01:29:27.865]  Most of these jihads, where it is about raping and killing and slaving, we're going to come back into the history of the real slave trade, and then cover some of the latest news.
[01:29:27.865 --> 01:29:30.746]  But I mean, it's just mainline history, and they hope we don't know.
[01:29:30.746 --> 01:29:38.968]  And I'm not here bashing Muslims in general, but it can be argued that the non-radical Muslims that are being exterminated by the Wahhabis as well, they're really apostate.
[01:29:38.968 --> 01:29:40.828]  You know, they're not in the religion.
[01:29:40.828 --> 01:29:42.369]  They're actually fleeing here to be free.
[01:29:42.369 --> 01:29:44.769]  I know a lot of Muslims that are like that.
[01:29:44.769 --> 01:29:47.470]  But the folks they're bringing in now are bloodthirsty.
[01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:51.033]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.033 --> 01:29:54.617]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.815 --> 01:30:05.357]  A Missouri bill defines sex between lawmakers and lobbyists as a gift, reports NBC News.
[01:30:05.357 --> 01:30:17.041]  Lobbyists in Missouri who have sex with state lawmakers or their aides would have to disclose that activity to the State Ethics Commission under a bill introduced this week by a Republican state representative.
[01:30:17.041 --> 01:30:28.045]  The measure, pushed by Representative Bart Corman, defines sexual relations between lawmakers and lobbyists as a gift to be reported on the disclosure forms that lobbyists file on a monthly basis.
[01:30:28.385 --> 01:30:32.147]  The bill does not assign a dollar valuation to the gift of sex.
[01:30:32.147 --> 01:30:38.451]  Corman's proposal, reported early Thursday by the Kansas City Star, quickly gained attention on social media.
[01:30:38.451 --> 01:30:47.096]  And Corman told USA Today that he was fielding calls from reporters all across the country, demanding to know more about his unorthodox proposal.
[01:30:47.096 --> 01:30:50.738]  I guess this has gone viral or something, he was quoted as saying.
[01:30:50.738 --> 01:30:54.580]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:30:58.553 --> 01:31:05.455]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[01:31:05.455 --> 01:31:08.356]  We've always offered five months free.

[01:32:32.656 --> 01:32:36.797]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.

[01:33:05.294 --> 01:33:06.696]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:06.696 --> 01:33:07.978]  You want answers?
[01:33:07.978 --> 01:33:10.041]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:10.041 --> 01:33:13.906]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:30.393 --> 01:33:40.281]  What Stefan Mahler has said is absolutely on target.
[01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:57.475]  They remove your culture, they demonize it, they only tell you bad parts of it, and then they bring in the most aggressive, no-compromise, anti-liberal, anti-Renaissance organizations that have already conquered the other Muslim areas that weren't as radical.
[01:34:00.213 --> 01:34:04.917]  And then you have no culture, and then you're intimidated by it, and you just submit to it.
[01:34:04.917 --> 01:34:06.538]  I mean, it is wild.
[01:34:06.538 --> 01:34:08.300]  We're going to go back to our guest here in just a moment.
[01:34:09.381 --> 01:34:18.823]  I'm not sure if Stefan thinks we should just air his video on the history of slavery and radical Islam expansionism or we should just have him go over it himself, but it's very powerful.
[01:34:18.823 --> 01:34:20.824]  We just posted it to Infowars.com.
[01:34:20.824 --> 01:34:26.885]  We just tweeted the YouTube link out to everybody, but I kind of want to air it here on air so everybody gets to hear it.
[01:34:26.885 --> 01:34:32.287]  Folks that are out there driving, truck drivers, you name it, who aren't online right now, but listen.
[01:34:33.615 --> 01:34:38.738]  We are offering 15% off and it ends tonight on everything at InfowarsStore.com.

[01:34:54.647 --> 01:34:55.988]  Simply amazing.

[01:34:58.949 --> 01:34:59.910]  We do it very slowly.
[01:35:01.018 --> 01:35:15.282]  We only source the very best, and you can also find the new 2016 InfoWars calendar for $6.95, and it's got thousands of dollars of coupons and coupon codes for InfoWarsStore.com in it, so that's a great deal.
[01:35:15.282 --> 01:35:25.365]  And we also are offering six months off, we usually offer five months off at the New Year, but six months off for InfoWars, Nightly News, Memberships, PrisonPlanet.tv, all my films,
[01:35:26.365 --> 01:35:28.727]  Commercial-free special events, all of it.
[01:35:28.727 --> 01:35:30.308]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:30.308 --> 01:35:34.591]  That's PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsNews.com.
[01:35:34.591 --> 01:35:35.371]  20 people!
[01:35:35.371 --> 01:35:40.534]  And you can watch it on your smart TV, Roku, Boxee, cable, you name it.
[01:35:40.534 --> 01:35:44.457]  InfoWarsNews.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:44.457 --> 01:35:48.219]  We're offering the biggest discount in its 15-year history because it's so successful now.
[01:35:48.219 --> 01:35:50.161]  As we get more members, we can lower the price.
[01:35:50.161 --> 01:35:54.724]  We're just paying for the bandwidth to have our own platform that they can't censor as easily.
[01:35:54.724 --> 01:35:55.064]  And listen,
[01:35:57.130 --> 01:35:58.651]  People try to make a controversy out of it.
[01:35:58.651 --> 01:36:01.873]  When I mention this, they try to make an even bigger controversy out of it, which I think is funny.
[01:36:01.873 --> 01:36:06.295]  The trolls go after it and they go, why are you on Facebook?
[01:36:06.295 --> 01:36:07.256]  They're evil.
[01:36:07.256 --> 01:36:08.576]  They track everybody.
[01:36:08.576 --> 01:36:11.958]  Why are you doing videos on Facebook?
[01:36:11.958 --> 01:36:13.339]  And of course the trolls are just jealous.
[01:36:13.339 --> 01:36:16.340]  The average video now is getting 500 to a million to 2 million, 3 million.
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:17.101]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:36:19.346 --> 01:36:23.128]  That's like saying, you know, in World War II, why did we invade France?
[01:36:23.128 --> 01:36:26.070]  I mean, because that's where Hitler's at.
[01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:27.610]  I'm not here to even demonize Facebook.
[01:36:27.610 --> 01:36:28.791]  It's a platform.
[01:36:28.791 --> 01:36:31.212]  We don't give Facebook anything.
[01:36:31.212 --> 01:36:34.194]  We go in and we get the word out.
[01:36:34.194 --> 01:36:41.318]  We post videos on the Facebook platform that millions watch a day who have never heard the truth.
[01:36:41.318 --> 01:36:43.439]  Why do the globalists broadcast propaganda at us?
[01:36:43.439 --> 01:36:45.320]  I mean, I can't believe how amateur people's brains are.
[01:36:47.833 --> 01:36:49.774]  Because they're trying to influence us.
[01:36:49.774 --> 01:36:50.975]  We're trying to influence people.
[01:36:50.975 --> 01:36:52.596]  We're countering Obama.
[01:36:52.596 --> 01:36:55.798]  That's why he's saying these websites, the internet, don't listen to him.
[01:36:55.798 --> 01:36:58.080]  Specifically talking about us and others.
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.641]  It's ridiculous.
[01:36:59.641 --> 01:37:02.022]  So I will continue and intensify Facebook mentions.
[01:37:02.022 --> 01:37:05.625]  It's making the establishment so mad that poses as trolls.
[01:37:05.625 --> 01:37:06.786]  But really it's a no-brainer.
[01:37:06.786 --> 01:37:13.070]  But we do have PrisonPlanet.tv as our original platform that's harder for them to censor.
[01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:15.331]  We got hacked and shut down last week.
[01:37:15.331 --> 01:37:17.373]  They didn't take the sites down, but they started to break in.
[01:37:18.293 --> 01:37:18.734]  I think so.
[01:37:33.444 --> 01:37:36.146]  You know, when a tree's dying in the desert, it'll put out a bunch of seeds.
[01:37:36.146 --> 01:37:38.548]  So when there's the next rain, there's 50 trees.
[01:37:38.548 --> 01:37:40.329]  And we're not dying, but we're under attack.
[01:37:40.329 --> 01:37:42.650]  We're growing, but being attacked at the same time.
[01:37:42.650 --> 01:37:45.132]  So we're multiplying new platforms.
[01:37:45.132 --> 01:37:51.116]  I mean, it's like saying to Stefan Molyneux, what are you doing on Google and YouTube reaching hundreds of millions of people, you piece of filth?
[01:37:51.116 --> 01:37:52.077]  You know, what are you doing?
[01:37:52.077 --> 01:37:56.280]  What are you doing dropping leaflets on the radical Muslims, you know, telling them they're in a cult?
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:00.123]  You know, it's just this idea that you're with Facebook because you're on it.
[01:38:00.743 --> 01:38:02.785]  And I'm not going to Facebook!
[01:38:02.785 --> 01:38:06.750]  Folks, I sit here and bash Zuckerberg with Merkel's censor-free speech.
[01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:08.552]  I talk about it on there.
[01:38:08.552 --> 01:38:11.235]  I follow their rules, though.
[01:38:11.235 --> 01:38:16.921]  So, that's the whole issue, is I'm going to make Google and YouTube and Facebook live up to their terms of service.
[01:38:16.921 --> 01:38:20.465]  I'm going to use... If they invite me on CNN, I'm going to go on and tear them up!
[01:38:21.533 --> 01:38:24.516]  That's what we're doing is engaging them, trying to win.
[01:38:24.516 --> 01:38:34.944]  There's this idea in liberty movement and in anti-corruption systems by some people that are just pessimists and losers who just want to bitch about things and not change things and have excuses for why they're losers.
[01:38:34.944 --> 01:38:36.566]  That's not what we are.
[01:38:36.566 --> 01:38:38.407]  We're here to change the culture.
[01:38:38.407 --> 01:38:42.511]  What we're selling is a trillion times better than tyranny, like Stefan just said.
[01:38:42.511 --> 01:38:48.035]  What we're promoting is renaissance and freedom and life extension and going to the stars and living to be 300.
[01:38:49.016 --> 01:38:51.337]  You're not going to have that under the globalist takeover.
[01:38:51.337 --> 01:38:55.038]  They want to wall off technology, keep it for themselves.
[01:38:55.038 --> 01:38:58.180]  So, PrisonPlanet.tv, get a membership.
[01:38:58.180 --> 01:38:59.800]  Especially those of you that don't like Facebook.
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.781]  I agree, we got our own platform.
[01:39:01.781 --> 01:39:04.262]  PrisonPlanet.tv, buy the books, buy the videos.
[01:39:05.492 --> 01:39:07.393]  Stefan, I am ranting here, my friend.
[01:39:07.393 --> 01:39:10.695]  I want you to speak about the history of Islam slavery.
[01:39:10.695 --> 01:39:19.581]  This is all mainline, and we're probably going to air your video, and then getting into other subjects, but separately, how dare you be on YouTube and be on an enemy platform?
[01:39:19.581 --> 01:39:20.982]  Why would you do that?
[01:39:20.982 --> 01:39:23.544]  I mean, why would you write an article in the New York Times if they let you?
[01:39:23.544 --> 01:39:24.825]  I mean, that's a dumb question.
[01:39:25.598 --> 01:39:26.178]  I don't know.
[01:39:26.178 --> 01:39:28.359]  If your enemy drops his weapon, do you not touch it?
[01:39:28.359 --> 01:39:29.939]  I mean, that's war, you know?
[01:39:29.939 --> 01:39:31.180]  We're in a battle for people's minds.
[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:34.201]  I use whatever I can to reach people without shame and without guilt.
[01:39:34.201 --> 01:39:38.002]  I mean, other people who are fussed by that can stay in their basements and not try and save the world.
[01:39:38.002 --> 01:39:39.523]  That's fine with me.
[01:39:39.523 --> 01:39:41.863]  You just crystallized what I tried to say in five minutes.
[01:39:41.863 --> 01:39:42.223]  Go ahead.
[01:39:42.223 --> 01:39:43.524]  Sorry.
[01:39:43.524 --> 01:39:45.785]  I'll do the rest of your show in 35 seconds if you don't mind.
[01:39:45.785 --> 01:39:46.365]  Do it, please.
[01:39:46.365 --> 01:39:46.765]  Go ahead.
[01:39:46.765 --> 01:39:46.985]  Do it.
[01:39:47.654 --> 01:40:02.494]  So, very briefly, okay, so when it comes to slavery, the general narrative is the rest of the world was living, you know, hugging unicorns, kumbaya, everybody giving group hugs, playing with puppies in their safe rooms, while the evil white Western European Christians were out there enslaving the world and colonizing it.
[01:40:02.574 --> 01:40:02.994]  We're good to go.
[01:40:23.803 --> 01:40:26.585]  of slavery in any culture throughout history.
[01:40:26.585 --> 01:40:31.708]  Slavery was indigenous to African and Arab countries before it made its way to Europe.
[01:40:31.708 --> 01:40:36.591]  Slavery was widely practiced by the American Indians long before Columbus came to the New World.
[01:40:36.591 --> 01:40:38.772]  Ethiopia had slavery until, yes, 1942.
[01:40:38.772 --> 01:40:39.372]  Saudi Arabia until 1962.
[01:40:39.372 --> 01:40:39.912]  Peru until 68.
[01:40:39.912 --> 01:40:40.173]  India until 76.
[01:40:40.173 --> 01:40:40.893]  And Mauritania until 1980.
[01:40:40.893 --> 01:40:40.933]  So,
[01:40:48.037 --> 01:40:48.978]  It was not very long.
[01:40:48.978 --> 01:40:55.364]  The big peak of Christian slavery, hmm, 1519, 1815, that was sort of the peak period.
[01:40:55.364 --> 01:41:11.057]  There have, however, been 14 centuries of Arabic or Muslim slavery, and it's hard to know exactly because the records were mostly castrated and killed, but it was about 150 million African people, about 50 million from other parts of the world, vastly exceeding anything that happened.
[01:41:11.057 --> 01:41:14.040]  I forgot, the Muslim slavery, they cut the penis and genitals off the men.
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:16.601]  Yeah, why are there no blacks?
[01:41:16.601 --> 01:41:23.645]  If blacks took 150... Sorry, if the Middle Easterners took 150 million black Africans, why are there so few blacks in the Middle East?
[01:41:23.645 --> 01:41:32.269]  Well, because 80 to 90 percent of them died en route, and those who remained were castrated, and if they managed to escape that and have children with a local, the child was killed.
[01:41:32.269 --> 01:41:36.292]  So there was massive genocide of the slaves in the Muslim countries.
[01:41:36.292 --> 01:41:39.033]  Now, of course, all cultures have bad stuff in their history.
[01:41:39.033 --> 01:41:39.573]  The question is, Alex,
[01:41:41.074 --> 01:41:44.776]  What is the Muslims' current view of that history?
[01:41:44.776 --> 01:41:49.079]  Are they looking back and saying, like the Europeans do, wow, we did some bad stuff?
[01:41:49.079 --> 01:41:52.020]  No, look at what ISIS did in Libya, targeting blacks.
[01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:53.001]  They believe they're subhuman.
[01:41:53.857 --> 01:41:54.677]  Right.
[01:41:54.677 --> 01:42:04.461]  And where are the Africans going to the Islamic countries demanding reparations, demanding preferential treatment, demanding massive resource transfers to them for the history of slavery?
[01:42:04.461 --> 01:42:09.362]  Because I don't think the Muslims feel a huge amount of guilt, at least according to what I've read.
[01:42:09.362 --> 01:42:10.803]  I'm sure some individuals do.
[01:42:11.593 --> 01:42:15.755]  There's not that same navel-gazing, looking in the mirror, saying, ooh, me bad, me bad, me bad.
[01:42:15.755 --> 01:42:20.938]  Well, the left also spins it, when I brought this up in college, to throw this in, and says it was different slavery in the Middle East than Africa.
[01:42:20.938 --> 01:42:22.819]  It was loving, like family.
[01:42:22.819 --> 01:42:26.341]  No, it's what you see with women chained up in houses with hoods on their heads.
[01:42:26.341 --> 01:42:30.683]  It's beyond what happened in most Western plantations, which I'm not defending.
[01:42:30.683 --> 01:42:37.027]  I'm just sick of, like, the abject sex slavery, white slavery of the Arabs, is legendary.
[01:42:38.294 --> 01:42:42.355]  Well, and so, number one, the Christians practiced slavery for the shortest amount of time.
[01:42:42.355 --> 01:42:45.896]  Number two, the Christians generally treated their slaves the best.
[01:42:45.896 --> 01:42:52.857]  But number three, which is also not insignificant, Christians ended slavery all around the world.
[01:42:52.857 --> 01:42:55.518]  I mean, they fought, they bled, they died.
[01:42:55.518 --> 01:43:00.259]  The British invaded a bunch of countries, took thousands of ships, you name it, would blow your ship up if you had slaves.
[01:43:01.139 --> 01:43:03.981]  And bribed people to give up their slaves.
[01:43:03.981 --> 01:43:07.804]  So, you know, there's that old saying that no good deed goes unpunished.
[01:43:07.804 --> 01:43:12.707]  If you want to look generally at the best culture throughout history, you've got to put on this weird inverse lens.
[01:43:12.707 --> 01:43:14.768]  You've got to look at things kind of upside down.
[01:43:14.768 --> 01:43:19.251]  The culture that is criticized in the modern world is almost always the culture that has done the most good.
[01:43:19.651 --> 01:43:28.996]  And the ending of slavery after untold tens of thousands of years of its practice among humanity was, if not the most, one of the greatest moral triumphs in history.
[01:43:28.996 --> 01:43:44.423]  And now the only culture, the only race, the only religion that is demonized for slavery is that exact same religion that ended it, creating the greatest moral crusade that the world has ever benefited from and bringing untold wealth and liberty to human beings around the world.
[01:43:44.423 --> 01:43:48.205]  So it is completely ridiculous to say, well, white people ought to feel bad for slavery.
[01:43:48.205 --> 01:43:48.485]  It's like
[01:43:49.205 --> 01:43:58.374]  And by the way, for liberals that are brainwashed, and just tuned in and can't believe this, this is mainline history.
[01:43:58.374 --> 01:44:01.477]  This is not what you're saying is in mainline history books.
[01:44:02.793 --> 01:44:05.655]  Well, and Europe, you know, why were there castles in Europe?
[01:44:05.655 --> 01:44:08.777]  Everyone thinks it's because of internecine European warfare.
[01:44:08.777 --> 01:44:09.978]  No, that was the 20th century.
[01:44:09.978 --> 01:44:10.519]  But what?
[01:44:10.519 --> 01:44:13.421]  There were castles because of Muslim slave raiders.
[01:44:13.421 --> 01:44:17.644]  Entire tracts of Europe, especially around the coast, had to be abandoned.
[01:44:17.644 --> 01:44:25.750]  And in the coast of Spain and Italy was abandoned because of Islamic raiders who were taking upwards of a million Europeans into slavery.
[01:44:26.724 --> 01:44:31.928]  Parts of Spain and Italy were abandoned on the coast until the 19th century.
[01:44:31.928 --> 01:44:35.311]  It is that recent and it is that, to that degree, has a history.
[01:44:35.311 --> 01:44:36.092]  Let's go further.
[01:44:36.092 --> 01:44:50.164]  Thomas Jefferson, our third president, had to launch a giant naval flotilla over two years just to be able to get any goods into the Mediterranean and into other areas there in the Indian Ocean.
[01:44:50.164 --> 01:44:51.685]  I mean, no one even knows this.
[01:44:52.746 --> 01:45:02.316]  Up until the 1900s in the Pacific and around Indonesia and places, Western governments had to pay bounties to the boobies and the pirates.
[01:45:02.316 --> 01:45:03.297]  Boobies aren't breast, folks.
[01:45:03.297 --> 01:45:04.759]  It means booby trap.
[01:45:04.759 --> 01:45:05.500]  Pirate.
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:06.741]  Muslim pirates.
[01:45:06.741 --> 01:45:08.603]  There were sultans everywhere.
[01:45:08.603 --> 01:45:10.365]  You had to pay until the 19th century.
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:21.910]  Right, so this idea that there's some kind of compatibility between Islamic culture and modern Western culture is completely insane.
[01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:26.694]  There is, in Sharia law, virtually no separation between church and state.
[01:45:26.694 --> 01:45:29.317]  Of course, the separation of church and state was one of the great gifts
[01:45:29.757 --> 01:45:47.970]  After a century of bloody religious warfare that the Protestant Reformation gave to Western Europe, which was to say, okay, we've got a government, the government is focused upon the prevention, ideally, of criminality and punishment of criminals and so on, but it is not a mechanism by which you can hijack it to impose your religious views on others.
[01:45:47.970 --> 01:45:51.873]  That was a separation of church and state, and I would argue that that gave a great deal of flourishing.
[01:45:52.333 --> 01:45:52.734]  We're good to go.
[01:46:08.817 --> 01:46:13.680]  That the best way that you get rid of bad ideas is to give them maximum exposure.
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:16.222]  You know, if you want to see where the roaches are, turn the light on.
[01:46:16.222 --> 01:46:29.269]  And so the idea that we should have a vigorous public debate, that all ideas should be able to fight their way into the battleground of human ideas, a uniquely Western concept, does not really exist anywhere in the Middle East.
[01:46:29.269 --> 01:46:31.311]  And is now under attack simultaneously.
[01:46:32.151 --> 01:46:42.380]  With them supporting it, the Islamicists, ending free speech all over Europe at universities and here, and it's Muslim groups in the UK driving to have Donald Trump banned from entering the UK.
[01:46:42.380 --> 01:46:47.145]  He says, fine, I won't invest anymore of the 700 million I was planning in golf courses.
[01:46:47.145 --> 01:46:48.486]  And they call him a terrorist.
[01:46:48.486 --> 01:46:51.389]  They say, give us your money, but you're not allowed to be here.
[01:46:51.389 --> 01:46:52.410]  You don't have free speech.
[01:46:53.567 --> 01:46:59.338]  Well this is how, oh man, I could chew my microphone into pieces on this one Alex, because this is so insane.
[01:46:59.338 --> 01:47:06.171]  The idea that Donald Trump says, let's put a pause on Muslim immigration until we figure out what's going on after San Bernardino shootings.
[01:47:06.914 --> 01:47:11.678]  And then the Muslim response in England is basically say, let's ban Donald Trump from coming into England.
[01:47:11.678 --> 01:47:18.403]  It's like, how do you argue against someone who's arguing for banning people from coming to your country by demanding that someone be banned from your country?
[01:47:18.403 --> 01:47:23.187]  This is the kind of unbelievable insanity that passes forethought in these kinds of areas.
[01:47:23.187 --> 01:47:26.990]  It's so ridiculously hypocritical and very few people have commented on that basic fact.
[01:47:27.639 --> 01:47:28.059]  You're right.
[01:47:28.059 --> 01:47:33.463]  They're saying it's wrong to try to ban people, so we ban you for your speech, not claiming you're dangerous, just banning your speech.
[01:47:33.463 --> 01:47:38.607]  But, by the way, you've got to give us your money, and some groups are calling for seizing his golf courses.
[01:47:38.607 --> 01:47:53.258]  But what I do love, and there's not much to love about this situation, as I'm sure you well know, but what I do love is the degree to which it is illuminating things like feminism and leftism and their complete hypocrisy and lack of functional regard for the future.
[01:47:53.258 --> 01:47:56.881]  Yeah, why are major German feminists, from mayors to you name it, defending the rapist?
[01:47:58.308 --> 01:48:02.331]  Well, keep an arm's length from people in your own country?
[01:48:02.331 --> 01:48:06.975]  I mean, you know, in Germany, you try and keep an arm's length, they think you're saluting Hitler, they'll throw you in jail!
[01:48:06.975 --> 01:48:14.982]  You can't keep an arm's length on the subway, you can't keep an arm's length on an airplane, keep an arm's length in a line-up, keep an arm's length in a line-up for a concert!
[01:48:14.982 --> 01:48:21.547]  What, were they supposed to keep an arm's length from everyone in the Paris concert where these guys went and shot up over 130 people?
[01:48:21.547 --> 01:48:27.072]  This idea that somehow it's become a mark of freedom to keep an arm's length from everyone around you
[01:48:27.412 --> 01:48:29.914]  And nobody's saying something has gone vast to the Orion?
[01:48:29.914 --> 01:48:30.855]  This is a woman who's saying it!
[01:48:30.855 --> 01:48:32.156]  Well, she also said, watch how you dress.
[01:48:32.156 --> 01:48:34.358]  I mean, that's the classic deal.
[01:48:34.358 --> 01:48:37.000]  Watch how you dress.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.523]  The West has been the best of women and reformed stuff all over the world for women.
[01:48:41.523 --> 01:48:42.504]  We get all blamed.
[01:48:42.504 --> 01:48:44.546]  They say normal sex is rape.
[01:48:44.546 --> 01:48:46.447]  All men are bad unless you're a jihadi.
[01:48:46.447 --> 01:48:47.228]  Where does that come from?
[01:48:48.103 --> 01:49:14.925]  Well, you see, it's very, very important, Alex, for feminists in the West to focus on things like a man spreading his legs slightly on the subway, or explaining things to women that maybe they already understand, and other kinds of microaggressions, rather than talk about what could be arguably a genuine rape culture that is currently spreading throughout Europe, and, I would argue, made its first real attempt to test the strength and resolve of Europeans, and in particular European men,
[01:49:15.285 --> 01:49:15.746]  We're good to go.
[01:49:36.306 --> 01:49:43.709]  Yeah, and now there's another approach where it's okay, let's test... By the way, what type of guy... I wouldn't rape somebody, but 200?
[01:49:43.709 --> 01:49:50.473]  This is the most sickening... I mean, if a woman isn't into me, it's an instant turn-off.
[01:49:50.473 --> 01:49:52.233]  I just can't even get rape.
[01:49:52.233 --> 01:49:55.055]  And then, meanwhile, a culture that's into it.
[01:49:55.055 --> 01:50:01.218]  And then I have two daughters, and then I have these feminists telling me I'm bad because I'm a western man, but they love jihadis.
[01:50:01.218 --> 01:50:01.838]  They're sick!
[01:50:03.095 --> 01:50:09.441]  I do not want my daughter growing up in a world where she has to wrap herself in a beekeeper suit and have a male relative escort her out of the house.
[01:50:09.441 --> 01:50:13.104]  That is not what my forefathers bled and fought and died for.
[01:50:13.104 --> 01:50:17.107]  That's another microaggression against the Muslims, buddy.
[01:50:17.107 --> 01:50:21.891]  Well, if only I didn't have to keep it to microaggressions, things might be a little bit better.
[01:50:21.891 --> 01:50:26.435]  And this has not really been called an act of terrorism, when in fact it is.
[01:50:26.435 --> 01:50:29.518]  The whole point is to make Europeans nervous about going out.
[01:50:30.322 --> 01:50:30.862]  That's it?
[01:50:30.862 --> 01:50:32.823]  Muslims engaged in sexual terrorism in Europe?
[01:50:32.823 --> 01:50:35.705]  Is that the name of this video?
[01:50:35.705 --> 01:50:37.566]  Stefan Molyneux, he's here with us, ranting.
[01:50:37.566 --> 01:50:38.546]  That's really what it is.
[01:50:38.546 --> 01:50:40.247]  That's really what is going on.
[01:50:40.247 --> 01:50:44.829]  Terrorism is changing people's political perspectives by acts of aggression.
[01:50:44.829 --> 01:50:48.631]  And the political perspectives in Germany are shifting now.
[01:50:48.631 --> 01:50:50.712]  Hold on, gotta go to break, Stefan.
[01:50:50.712 --> 01:50:58.096]  And folks, you can find his website and his podcast and more at Stefan Molyneux, freedomainradio.com.
[01:50:58.752 --> 01:51:01.813]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:51:01.813 --> 01:51:04.433]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:51:04.433 --> 01:51:05.174]  Croix River.
[01:51:05.174 --> 01:51:07.414]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:51:07.414 --> 01:51:10.375]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:51:10.375 --> 01:51:11.255]  His excuse?
[01:51:11.255 --> 01:51:12.595]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:51:12.595 --> 01:51:14.196]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:51:14.196 --> 01:51:19.957]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[01:51:32.392 --> 01:51:34.093]  And they're getting worse.
[01:51:34.093 --> 01:51:37.655]  That's why Infidel Body Armor introduces Infidel Fridays.

[01:52:59.244 --> 01:53:01.025]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:53:01.025 --> 01:53:02.686]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[01:53:07.788 --> 01:53:12.310]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:37.501]  The Great American Outdoor Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

[01:53:49.367 --> 01:53:56.270]  Go to survivalistcamps.com, then plan on joining us at the Great American Outdoor Show in February in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
[01:54:05.512 --> 01:54:08.534]  Well, he pledged allegiance to ISIS.
[01:54:08.534 --> 01:54:14.939]  Then he shot the police officer on video, screaming, Allah Akbar.
[01:54:14.939 --> 01:54:24.126]  And you better believe they'll call for more gun control because of it, because you and I are guilty, under collectivism, for one of the jihadis they brought into the country in Muslim dress.
[01:54:24.927 --> 01:54:26.308]  Running around killing a cop.
[01:54:26.308 --> 01:54:35.473]  That's what's sick is the weird MSNBC, Kill Whitey, race baiting is merging with Islam and so is like gangster culture.
[01:54:36.716 --> 01:54:38.997]  And it is socially engineered by the Ford Foundation.
[01:54:38.997 --> 01:54:43.480]  They admit they're doing this, which shows you really how whacked out they are.
[01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:55.988]  Why would you want to take Syria, not attacking us, progressive compared to other countries, let jihadists come in, kill hundreds of thousands of people, mainly Christians, blow up all the ancient architecture and culture, blow up the ancient markets,
[01:54:57.745 --> 01:55:04.132]  Why is our government putting radical Islamists in and getting rid of the guys in suits and ties where women can go to college and be free?
[01:55:04.132 --> 01:55:05.294]  I mean, it's true.
[01:55:05.294 --> 01:55:08.037]  Saddam's not perfect, but compared to al-Qaeda, he's a good guy.
[01:55:08.037 --> 01:55:10.519]  Assad's a lot better than Assad.
[01:55:10.519 --> 01:55:16.907]  Gaddafi works for the West, opens up, women go to college, they don't have to wear hoods on their heads, black people are treated like first-class citizens.
[01:55:16.907 --> 01:55:17.467]  They kill him!
[01:55:18.288 --> 01:55:26.494]  I mean, it really does just show power-mad evil to ally with the dominant Islamic force, Wahhabism, out of Saudi Arabia.
[01:55:26.494 --> 01:55:41.744]  I don't think they're going to be able to suspend reality, have their jihadis keep attacking, and then blame it on gun owners and the general public, and have civil emergency.
[01:55:41.744 --> 01:55:47.848]  I think the political class is going to be punished for what they're doing, and I think the left, the political correctness, has gone too far.
[01:55:49.209 --> 01:55:54.252]  Well, I think it's important to remember that stability in the Middle East is just another government program.
[01:55:54.252 --> 01:56:02.297]  World peace, as they claim to deliver, is just another government program and will do about as well as the welfare state and the war on drugs and you name it.
[01:56:02.297 --> 01:56:07.300]  So the fact is, of course, that they were supposed to bring peace and stability and democracy to the Middle East.
[01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:08.000]  And what has happened?
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.142]  Well, the Middle East is in flames.
[01:56:10.142 --> 01:56:16.906]  So not only has that program done the exact opposite of what it was claimed, just like Obamacare did in terms of making health care affordable,
[01:56:17.606 --> 01:56:24.272]  But it has not only destabilized the Middle East, but it is wildly in the process of destroying Europe.
[01:56:24.272 --> 01:56:31.658]  And this is what happens when people put their faith in the modern devil called the interventionist state.
[01:56:31.658 --> 01:56:41.606]  Gaddafi said in 2010, you better have a plan, because if you get rid of the dictators in the Middle East, you will get massive floods of migrants into Europe.
[01:56:41.606 --> 01:56:44.108]  We are the ones holding them back.
[01:56:44.108 --> 01:56:46.970]  And next thing you know, Hillary Clinton is like, yay, we killed him!
[01:56:47.370 --> 01:56:48.351]  Here comes liberty!
[01:56:48.351 --> 01:56:53.634]  I kill people for no reason!
[01:56:53.634 --> 01:56:54.175]  I'm tough!
[01:56:54.175 --> 01:56:55.876]  The big picture thing is important to understand.
[01:56:55.876 --> 01:56:57.017]  This didn't come out of nowhere.
[01:56:57.017 --> 01:57:08.745]  This came out of people's faith in the state to provide something as historically unattainable and complex as peace and stability in the Middle East, which is a fairly superstitious and volatile region at the best of times.
[01:57:09.305 --> 01:57:17.952]  They can't even reduce the murder rate in Washington, let alone bring peace to some foreign culture that they don't even speak the language of thousands of miles away.
[01:57:17.952 --> 01:57:31.603]  So the reason why European civilization is crumbling in an ever-accelerating fashion is because people continue to put their faith in the modern god of the state, which is in fact the devil in all of its consequences.
[01:57:32.424 --> 01:57:33.886]  No kidding.
[01:57:33.886 --> 01:57:35.707]  But see, we say the state's incompetent.
[01:57:35.707 --> 01:57:42.173]  The globalist corporations making money off servicing the state and the calamities admit they want a crisis economy.
[01:57:42.173 --> 01:57:43.895]  And they knew they were destabilizing.
[01:57:43.895 --> 01:57:45.376]  They knew it would fall into Europe.
[01:57:45.376 --> 01:57:47.838]  They opened the borders with Peter Sutherland and the EU.
[01:57:47.838 --> 01:57:51.141]  They said to end the homogeneity and bring balkanization.
[01:57:51.141 --> 01:57:52.783]  I mean, they write articles admitting their plan.
[01:57:52.783 --> 01:57:53.904]  They're actually pretty competent.
[01:57:54.807 --> 01:58:02.261]  Well, and I would argue that it's impossible to understand world events right now without understanding that we are in the end days of fiat currency.
[01:58:02.970 --> 01:58:10.693]  The long stretched out Monopoly money fantasy castle is about to be blown down by the insistent winds of economic reality.
[01:58:10.693 --> 01:58:13.334]  There is simply no way to understand world events.
[01:58:13.334 --> 01:58:15.495]  The welfare state is the fundamental problem.
[01:58:15.495 --> 01:58:20.037]  I'm all for free border movement as long as people have the right to not associate with others.
[01:58:20.037 --> 01:58:22.858]  And the welfare state... And not to pay the hordes of people coming in.
[01:58:22.858 --> 01:58:23.558]  Back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:23.558 --> 01:58:25.879]  We'll give you the floor for five minutes to finish up with this.
[01:58:25.879 --> 01:58:27.680]  Folks, it is an implosion plan.
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:29.381]  But you can say, well, they're incompetent or are they competent?
[01:58:29.901 --> 01:58:33.465]  Well, no, they're competent at burning the house down and collecting the insurance money.
[01:58:33.465 --> 01:58:35.067]  And that's what the world elite are doing.
[01:58:35.067 --> 01:58:39.672]  Creating crises, posing as saviors, grabbing more power as civilization falls apart.
[01:58:39.672 --> 01:58:46.000]  And they hate liberty so much, they want to dominate us with a pit bull of foaming at the mouth crazy islamicists.
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:46.921]  I mean, this is insane!
[01:58:48.556 --> 01:58:53.619]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.
[01:58:53.619 --> 01:59:02.463]  Longevity integrates years of scientific research into creating fantastic products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, plant-derived minerals, and much more.

[01:59:50.562 --> 01:59:53.145]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:02.293 --> 02:00:04.895]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:23.402 --> 02:00:28.684]  But they like a dominant, strong man who knows what he's doing and who can sweep her off her feet.
[02:00:28.684 --> 02:00:31.546]  It's not that she's weak, she just wants a really good man.
[02:00:31.546 --> 02:00:34.607]  That's genetic in all mammals, all species.
[02:00:34.607 --> 02:00:40.029]  But these leftists that have destroyed men in general, I mean they've done a good job.
[02:00:40.029 --> 02:00:43.951]  They act like they're tough, not really men, they're just little weirdos.
[02:00:45.063 --> 02:00:52.648]  Then they're so desperate, a lot of them are actually going out and getting a Muslim guy, or whatever, they'll slap him around, knock their teeth out, which is not what a good woman should want.
[02:00:52.648 --> 02:00:55.890]  But then they go to the really bizarre extreme of it.
[02:00:55.890 --> 02:01:02.575]  To a guy that doesn't work, sits on the couch, and tells her, get in there in the kitchen, make me money, and get out on the street and turn some tricks.
[02:01:02.575 --> 02:01:05.017]  And they just seem to like it.
[02:01:05.976 --> 02:01:08.238]  So gone are the guys opening the door for you.
[02:01:08.238 --> 02:01:10.640]  They like being backhanded and getting that nose broken.
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:11.300]  And I'm not kidding.
[02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:12.301]  They want to be cuckold.
[02:01:12.301 --> 02:01:13.602]  They want to be crushed.
[02:01:13.602 --> 02:01:15.444]  I think there's a sick mental illness to all this.
[02:01:15.444 --> 02:01:18.146]  Stefan Molyneux, your take on that and other closing points.
[02:01:18.146 --> 02:01:20.148]  I want to get you back more often, my friend.
[02:01:20.148 --> 02:01:20.588]  Oh, thanks.
[02:01:20.588 --> 02:01:22.530]  It's a great pleasure to be back on the show.
[02:01:22.530 --> 02:01:32.178]  And people were saying, you know, a lot in sort of the comments and the emails and messages that I received, saying about these Cologne and other city attacks on the women.
[02:01:32.834 --> 02:01:35.617]  In Germany they were saying, WHERE ARE THE GERMAN MEN?
[02:01:35.617 --> 02:01:40.382]  And of course they're not talking about the, you know, the mustachioed, foot-stomping, march-across-Europe German men.
[02:01:40.382 --> 02:01:43.946]  Just the men who would rush to the defense of victimized women around them.
[02:01:43.946 --> 02:01:44.707]  The police wouldn't even help!
[02:01:44.707 --> 02:01:46.268]  The police wouldn't help?
[02:01:46.268 --> 02:01:47.490]  But here's the thing, Alex.
[02:01:47.490 --> 02:01:48.551]  I think that, um...
[02:01:49.730 --> 02:01:56.775]  It has been so ingrained in Western men that in any confrontation between a white man and a minority, the facts don't matter.
[02:01:56.775 --> 02:01:58.977]  The white man's life will be destroyed.
[02:01:58.977 --> 02:02:02.559]  Look at George Zimmerman or Darren Wilson or other people.
[02:02:02.559 --> 02:02:03.820]  The facts don't matter.
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:05.201]  Your life will be destroyed.
[02:02:05.201 --> 02:02:10.705]  You know, there used to be this old saying when it came to self-defense, it's better to be tried by 12 than carried by 6.
[02:02:10.705 --> 02:02:11.566]  That's right.
[02:02:11.566 --> 02:02:13.227]  I'm not sure that that's true anymore.
[02:02:13.227 --> 02:02:14.268]  I think people are saying
[02:02:14.848 --> 02:02:19.853]  I will take anything because the media is going to side with the minority no matter what the facts are.
[02:02:19.853 --> 02:02:23.817]  My life is going to be destroyed even if I'm vindicated in a court of law.
[02:02:23.817 --> 02:02:25.078]  My life is going to be destroyed.
[02:02:25.078 --> 02:02:28.321]  My family, my career, my income is going to be destroyed.
[02:02:28.321 --> 02:02:38.852]  And so there's been this fantastic media hold them down of white males to the point where self-defense has become an impractical art of social and economic suicide.
[02:02:39.838 --> 02:02:40.299]  I agree.
[02:02:40.299 --> 02:02:41.560]  We are being domesticated.
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:43.281]  I mean, everybody is, basically.
[02:02:43.281 --> 02:02:51.730]  But then they bring in a third world population that we're shooting LAWS rockets, RPGs at each other a month before, and raping and beheading women and sex slaving.
[02:02:51.730 --> 02:02:53.892]  I mean, what does the left think is going to happen?
[02:02:53.892 --> 02:02:54.973]  This is going to be explosive.
[02:02:56.118 --> 02:03:09.208]  Well, the fact that the left is allied with a very primitive, medieval, and medieval is even a compliment, pre-medieval Sharia-type enemy, the fact that the left is allied with them is very revealing.
[02:03:09.208 --> 02:03:15.833]  It's not revealing to the left, who again, are simply just power junkies looking for their next fix, but it's revealing to everyone else.
[02:03:15.833 --> 02:03:22.818]  Like the fact that the left says to Donald Trump, Mr. Trump, it's terrible that you show up in an ISIS recruitment video.
[02:03:23.504 --> 02:03:28.586]  Well, if the West is at war with ISIS, as they, or as we claim to be... You should show up!
[02:03:28.586 --> 02:03:29.667]  That's a good thing!
[02:03:29.667 --> 02:03:33.228]  You know, Churchill, do you know you're showing up in Nazi propaganda?
[02:03:33.228 --> 02:03:35.469]  It's like, that's the point of being at war!
[02:03:35.469 --> 02:03:37.710]  I'm in their videos, so is Joe Biggs!
[02:03:37.710 --> 02:03:39.511]  We're in ISIS videos!
[02:03:39.511 --> 02:03:40.191]  I'm not proud of that!
[02:03:40.191 --> 02:03:44.353]  If I haven't shown up in an ISIS video soon, I'm incredibly disappointed with my performance.
[02:03:44.353 --> 02:03:45.733]  It's terrible!
[02:03:45.733 --> 02:03:49.555]  That's the point of fighting, is you're supposed to annoy the people you're fighting, at the very least.
[02:03:50.287 --> 02:03:59.015]  Well, you're doing a great job, and I want to invite you at least once a month on this show and on the Nightly News, because really, you're one of the smartest guys in the room when it comes to boiling it down.
[02:03:59.015 --> 02:04:00.236]  You're dead on.
[02:04:00.236 --> 02:04:02.719]  But really, this is so nakedly black and white.
[02:04:02.719 --> 02:04:05.081]  Most things historically aren't really black and white.
[02:04:05.081 --> 02:04:09.165]  What the crazy power grabbers are doing really is black and white insanity.
[02:04:10.011 --> 02:04:11.793]  Thanks Alex, it was a real pleasure to talk to you again.
[02:04:26.309 --> 02:04:28.690]  To know there are so many people out there.
[02:04:28.690 --> 02:04:31.192]  And you know, Stefan is an atheist, basically.
[02:04:31.192 --> 02:04:32.233]  I think I can say that.
[02:04:32.233 --> 02:04:34.254]  And you know, he's a smart guy and I respect him.
[02:04:34.254 --> 02:04:37.456]  He's a cool guy, you know, who actually has his views and can back them up.
[02:04:37.456 --> 02:04:42.899]  He's not one of these leftist atheists that wants to, you know, says I'm an evil, you know, right-winger and wants my guns.
[02:04:43.719 --> 02:04:46.442]  And so he reaches out to a lot of people on the left that wouldn't listen to me.
[02:04:46.442 --> 02:04:47.243]  That's great.
[02:04:47.243 --> 02:04:48.404]  That's what it's all about, folks.
[02:04:48.404 --> 02:04:53.328]  Different strokes for different folks, but all together promoting freedom, open debate.
[02:04:53.328 --> 02:04:57.032]  That's what a diverse civilization is, not political correctness and Sharia law.
[02:04:59.053 --> 02:05:06.618]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com, overflow crowd for Donald Trump in Bernie Sanders' backyard, article up by the New York Times.
[02:05:06.618 --> 02:05:18.647]  Donald J. Trump touchdown in one of America's most progressive cities Thursday night, bringing the bombastic message that has captivated Republican voters into the backyard of a Democratic opponent.
[02:05:18.647 --> 02:05:21.709]  Senator Bernie, let's give it all away, Sanders of Vermont.
[02:05:22.009 --> 02:05:41.151]  This visit came as the billionaire real estate mogul has made a point of broadening his focus beyond the early primary states, showcasing his popularity with packed rallies from Mississippi to Massachusetts, and now Vermont, a one-time Republican bastion that is now one of the most solid liberal states in the nation.
[02:05:41.331 --> 02:05:46.917]  The choice of venue seemed curious to some, but Thursday's rally served multiple purposes for the Trump campaign.
[02:05:46.917 --> 02:05:54.344]  Needling Mr. Sanders in his own neighborhood, garnering attention in nearby New Hampshire, which holds the nation's first primary next month.
[02:05:54.344 --> 02:05:57.247]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:57.247 --> 02:05:57.928]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[02:05:58.328 --> 02:05:58.968]  I want more candy!
[02:05:58.968 --> 02:06:00.109]  I want more video games!
[02:06:00.109 --> 02:06:00.309]  Mine!
[02:06:00.309 --> 02:06:00.810]  Mine!
[02:06:00.810 --> 02:06:01.690]  Mine!
[02:06:28.268 --> 02:06:28.628]  I think so.

[02:07:50.356 --> 02:07:52.497]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[02:07:52.497 --> 02:08:00.840]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:02.680]  We are on the march.
[02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:05.842]  The empire is on the run.
[02:08:05.842 --> 02:08:09.523]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.886 --> 02:08:34.861]  Earlier in the last hour, I put a compilation of eight different clips of President Obama as a candidate, and early on in his administration, six years ago, saying that a president with executive orders on law is tyranny.
[02:08:34.861 --> 02:08:36.663]  And he's a constitutional lawyer, so he knows that.
[02:08:36.663 --> 02:08:45.070]  Well, he said earlier this week at the White House in a press conference that Congress won't act and get in line, that's a quote, so he's going to act.
[02:08:46.519 --> 02:08:54.164]  It's advisory, but magically some algorithm for a no-fly list that's extra-judicial, extra-legislative.
[02:08:54.164 --> 02:08:57.366]  They just put you on it, and you can't own a gun.
[02:08:57.366 --> 02:09:08.433]  And they're going to go after gun manufacturers, and they're going to tell your doctor to spy on you, and they're going to do so many other things in an executive power grab that on its face is unprecedented.
[02:09:08.433 --> 02:09:10.494]  More executive orders in the last six presidents.
[02:09:12.162 --> 02:09:13.383]  Where is the move to impeach him?
[02:09:13.383 --> 02:09:16.685]  I had Donald Trump on here and he said, well, it'll just make him kind of a victim.
[02:09:16.685 --> 02:09:19.167]  He's only got 11 months left in office.
[02:09:19.167 --> 02:09:21.789]  We don't have 11 months to wait.
[02:09:21.789 --> 02:09:24.371]  He was on CNN last night saying, I'll be gone soon.
[02:09:24.371 --> 02:09:25.832]  Don't worry about this gun stuff.
[02:09:25.832 --> 02:09:28.113]  They're having the agency start all this up.
[02:09:28.113 --> 02:09:32.977]  And the Republican leadership, the same ones that gave us Obamacare, you name it, they're going to let it stand.
[02:09:35.598 --> 02:09:38.119]  Sheriff Mack got the Brady Bill overturned.
[02:09:38.119 --> 02:09:41.280]  They just did instant check, which was outside of law.
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:44.041]  And then they just keep expanding that.
[02:09:44.041 --> 02:09:45.402]  Just like he's done with open borders.
[02:09:45.402 --> 02:09:48.443]  Just like he won't tell governors where the refugees are being taken.
[02:09:48.443 --> 02:09:49.523]  They're just turned loose.
[02:09:49.523 --> 02:09:51.864]  It's all illegal.
[02:09:51.864 --> 02:09:53.645]  So there's a bunch of reasons to impeach him.
[02:09:53.645 --> 02:09:56.986]  We had an article yesterday, 75 crimes of Barack Obama.
[02:09:58.541 --> 02:10:02.322]  But there was an article that went viral that Steve Watson wrote on Monday.
[02:10:02.322 --> 02:10:07.964]  Report, RNC will consider Obama impeachment proceedings 48 criminal charges.
[02:10:07.964 --> 02:10:11.845]  And we have the North American Law Center on with us.
[02:10:11.845 --> 02:10:13.146]  I've called Congress.
[02:10:13.146 --> 02:10:14.586]  I've confirmed they are looking at this.
[02:10:14.586 --> 02:10:16.006]  They are circulating it.
[02:10:16.006 --> 02:10:19.447]  Other draft resolutions are circulating.
[02:10:19.447 --> 02:10:23.609]  Steven Pidgeon is a political scientist, PhD, and a lawyer.
[02:10:24.509 --> 02:10:29.232]  And he is spearheading this operation of the North American Law Center dot O-R-G.
[02:10:29.232 --> 02:10:31.993]  And we're here beating the drum.
[02:10:31.993 --> 02:10:37.096]  Now he's been on national television as well saying, look, we've got to go ahead and start this.
[02:10:37.096 --> 02:10:38.557]  It's our duty.
[02:10:38.557 --> 02:10:44.100]  We can't just say, well, strategically, we want to let the president, you know, barbecue children on the White House lawn.
[02:10:44.100 --> 02:10:46.261]  We start aiding and abetting those crimes.
[02:10:47.495 --> 02:10:49.516]  Okay, so that's my view.
[02:10:49.516 --> 02:10:55.918]  He is a political scientist and a lawyer, and he's been battling and challenging Obama's lawlessness.
[02:10:55.918 --> 02:10:58.159]  But remember, this will pass on to the Republicans as well.
[02:10:58.159 --> 02:11:00.720]  This is precedent setting.
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:03.741]  We have to push back, in my view, and at least have the hearings.
[02:11:03.741 --> 02:11:04.481]  Look how many of his
[02:11:06.661 --> 02:11:10.043]  Agency heads have had to resign and are on the verge of criminal charges.
[02:11:10.043 --> 02:11:13.466]  Hillary is within millimeters of being indicted.
[02:11:13.466 --> 02:11:14.967]  That's mainstream news right now.
[02:11:14.967 --> 02:11:17.569]  Her emails, lying to Congress, it's all coming out.
[02:11:17.569 --> 02:11:24.434]  We either get on the offensive, folks, or they're going to take it as a big fat green light to run us over.
[02:11:24.434 --> 02:11:26.695]  This is a critical decision right now.
[02:11:26.695 --> 02:11:28.657]  Probably one of the most important in our country's history.
[02:11:28.657 --> 02:11:31.379]  And you know I don't usually talk like that.
[02:11:31.379 --> 02:11:32.560]  I can hardly sleep at night.
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:34.281]  I usually sleep like the dead.
[02:11:34.281 --> 02:11:35.382]  Could have been in like 30 seconds.
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:37.942]  I've quit drinking coffee in the afternoons.
[02:11:37.942 --> 02:11:42.768]  I'm having trouble going to sleep the last week because I can just feel the momentousness.
[02:11:42.768 --> 02:11:45.271]  I had a big guest on last hour, said the same thing.
[02:11:45.271 --> 02:11:47.354]  Everybody can feel it, not just see it.
[02:11:49.003 --> 02:11:50.605]  Evil is on the move, folks.
[02:11:50.605 --> 02:11:53.067]  The good news is, good is on the move as well.
[02:11:53.067 --> 02:11:58.371]  In liberal, socialist, brain-dead Bernie Sanders districts, Trump's got 40-50,000 people.
[02:11:58.371 --> 02:12:00.373]  I mean, this is unprecedented.
[02:12:00.373 --> 02:12:03.476]  So, joining us is Stephen Pidgeon, NorthAmericanLawCenter.org.
[02:12:03.476 --> 02:12:08.360]  Sir, you're the constitutional lawyer, political scientist, but my point is, am I right?
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:10.001]  We have a responsibility?
[02:12:10.001 --> 02:12:13.804]  I mean, the law isn't something we just enforce when we feel like it, sir.
[02:12:13.804 --> 02:12:14.325]  Is that correct?
[02:12:15.171 --> 02:12:18.972]  That's correct, Alex, and in fact, what you're saying is extremely important.
[02:12:18.972 --> 02:12:34.994]  We've reached a threshold point now where Mr. Obama is poised to completely overthrow the Constitutional Republic with a continuous stream of executive orders which exceed the power of the presidency and usurp the authority of Congress.
[02:12:34.994 --> 02:12:43.656]  He's doing it through the expansion of bureaucracies and demanding Congress fall in line with his ultra-virus acts to the Constitution.
[02:12:44.542 --> 02:12:59.182]  This latest play with gun control is particularly onerous and he's using the socialist tax plan called Obamacare to implement what really are policies that were originated in the Third Reich.
[02:12:59.682 --> 02:13:15.971]  You know, the Obamacare strikes chords of doctrines that were criminalized under the 1947 Nuremberg Act when doctors were executed from the Nazi regime for proposing just exactly what's on the table with Obamacare.
[02:13:15.971 --> 02:13:17.672]  And he's using the same playbook
[02:13:18.553 --> 02:13:22.336]  To say, well, doctors can determine whether or not you're a health care threat.
[02:13:22.336 --> 02:13:26.179]  If you're a social security recipient, you have no right to own a firearm.
[02:13:26.179 --> 02:13:43.013]  So on and so forth, all in a guise to completely disarm the American public while he imports hundreds of thousands of Muslim terrorists and other paid mercenaries who come into the country unarmed to find mosques that are essentially armories.
[02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:47.781]  And what you're saying is borne out by the facts.
[02:13:47.781 --> 02:13:51.102]  It sounds sensational, but for those that don't know, it's the plotting.
[02:13:51.102 --> 02:13:56.684]  Obamacare, an open power grab over the whole infrastructure, one-seventh the economy, blank check.
[02:13:56.684 --> 02:14:03.766]  The funding, the UPS planes, funded by the Feds, flying in, disappearing.
[02:14:03.766 --> 02:14:07.027]  JFK Airport says we're told just let them in and just release them.
[02:14:07.027 --> 02:14:08.088]  We don't even look at their IDs.
[02:14:09.008 --> 02:14:11.789]  I mean, meanwhile, the TSA grubs 10-year-old girls.
[02:14:11.789 --> 02:14:21.573]  This is an unprecedented takeover, and walking through this, sir, you'll flesh out what you're saying here about this appearing to be a planned takeover, because I agree.
[02:14:21.573 --> 02:14:24.594]  This doesn't just look like a soft takeover anymore.
[02:14:24.594 --> 02:14:27.936]  It looks like there could be even more draconian stuff planned.
[02:14:28.777 --> 02:14:29.317]  It's not.
[02:14:29.317 --> 02:14:30.738]  It's not a soft takeover anymore.
[02:14:30.738 --> 02:14:32.059]  And this is where we have arrived.
[02:14:32.059 --> 02:14:46.589]  I mean, all of this business of allowing criminal activity on the part of Mr. Obama over the last six years, including his usurpation of the office, his failure to establish his own identity, his identity fraud, actionable identity fraud.
[02:14:47.289 --> 02:15:06.847]  The crimes he's committed in terms of rules of engagement in the field, deploying American troops, spending money, American tax dollars, to further the benefit of Hezbollah, Hamas, the Palestinian Liberation Army, Islamic Jihad, his own funding, training, and deployment of ISIS.
[02:15:06.847 --> 02:15:12.612]  All of these are well-established facts and buttressed by a great deal of evidence and all
[02:15:13.272 --> 02:15:14.973]  Well, he wears a Wahhabist ring, he
[02:15:40.970 --> 02:15:41.250]  I think?
[02:16:00.447 --> 02:16:01.988]  With high-level folks.
[02:16:01.988 --> 02:16:04.370]  And I've got Bongino calling me up going, I didn't tell you that.
[02:16:04.370 --> 02:16:05.931]  I said on air, no it wasn't Bongino.
[02:16:05.931 --> 02:16:08.473]  He said it's worse than I know, but never told me anything secret.
[02:16:08.473 --> 02:16:09.994]  The head of Obama's Foreign Details.
[02:16:09.994 --> 02:16:11.996]  And then he quit, saying it's worse than you know.
[02:16:11.996 --> 02:16:16.600]  I have got it, and I've gotten some threats over this, because they know it's true.
[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:19.362]  Obama is a practicing Wahhabist.
[02:16:19.362 --> 02:16:21.784]  He actually prays every five times a day.
[02:16:21.784 --> 02:16:26.347]  And I didn't believe this back when I heard it five years ago, but this is from high-level people.
[02:16:26.347 --> 02:16:27.368]  They are scared of him.
[02:16:28.909 --> 02:16:31.672]  I mean, I guess that's why Congress won't do anything.
[02:16:31.672 --> 02:16:35.176]  He's backed by George Soros, this crazy Nazi collaborator.
[02:16:35.176 --> 02:16:36.917]  I can't believe we're in this much trouble.
[02:16:36.917 --> 02:16:38.419]  And the left is supporting it.
[02:16:38.419 --> 02:16:41.362]  And Merkel says, basically, let, quote, criminals come in.
[02:16:41.362 --> 02:16:42.423]  That's a quote.
[02:16:42.423 --> 02:16:46.427]  And the feminist mayor says, let them, you know, it's your fault, women, that you're raped.
[02:16:46.427 --> 02:16:50.411]  I mean, I guess the left really is taking over and is allied with radical Islam.
[02:16:51.124 --> 02:16:52.824]  Well, it's not just the left, Alex.
[02:16:52.824 --> 02:16:54.305]  This is what our problem is here today.
[02:16:54.305 --> 02:17:00.006]  We've had a great deal of stonewalling coming from the upper leadership also of the Republican Party.
[02:17:00.006 --> 02:17:02.127]  And there really is no excuse for it.
[02:17:02.127 --> 02:17:11.669]  Recently, 163 Democrat legislators signed on a bill that will essentially get the Bill of Rights entirely based upon this gun control rhetoric.
[02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:16.371]  So we're at a point where it's gun control today and internment camps tomorrow.
[02:17:16.371 --> 02:17:17.331]  The reality is
[02:17:17.951 --> 02:17:24.258]  That when you're discussing Mr. Obama, he has committed a series of crimes that are ongoing.
[02:17:24.258 --> 02:17:26.300]  And the crimes have not stopped.
[02:17:26.300 --> 02:17:32.908]  We had to stop at 48 articles because we just simply couldn't gather together more of the treasonous acts that he's committed.
[02:17:32.908 --> 02:17:38.313]  For instance, trading Mr. Bergdahl for five Al-Qaeda leaders that were immediately deployed into the field.
[02:17:39.102 --> 02:17:42.707]  Also spying on Congress, an article that appears to have gone away.
[02:17:42.707 --> 02:17:46.251]  Spying on Congress and foreign leaders without any probable cause.
[02:17:46.251 --> 02:17:52.559]  We're under a search and seizure environment with cameras deployed everywhere and NSA downloads, etc.
[02:17:52.559 --> 02:17:57.405]  All of these things violate the Constitution and we've sat back and taken it for six years.
[02:17:57.985 --> 02:18:08.468]  Now, when you have a president who has usurped congressional authority, and Congress allows it to happen, we don't have months, we don't even have weeks.
[02:18:08.468 --> 02:18:16.350]  This man could start World War III tomorrow, and he could enact martial law at the twilling of a pen.
[02:18:16.350 --> 02:18:18.610]  These things become critically important.
[02:18:18.610 --> 02:18:24.632]  There has been some people with integrity inside the Republican National Committee, namely Dave Ajima.
[02:18:25.293 --> 02:18:29.917]  Who has brought forth a resolution to the RNC and said, consider these articles of impeachment.
[02:18:29.917 --> 02:18:31.338]  That was my next question, sir.
[02:18:31.338 --> 02:18:32.579]  How much support do we have?
[02:18:32.579 --> 02:18:34.320]  Thank God you're in there getting this done.
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:39.544]  I can't believe we aren't hearing from more congressmen and women themselves calling for it when they have in the past.
[02:18:39.544 --> 02:18:40.945]  This is so egregious.
[02:18:40.945 --> 02:18:44.308]  Let's walk through that in a moment because this is so important.
[02:18:44.308 --> 02:18:47.751]  But let me first, since you mentioned martial law, back you up.
[02:18:47.751 --> 02:18:49.973]  This article needs to go mega viral.
[02:18:49.973 --> 02:18:50.913]  Report.
[02:18:50.913 --> 02:18:52.695]  RNC will consider Obama
[02:18:54.115 --> 02:18:57.877]  It's up on Infowars.com, but let's continue.
[02:18:57.877 --> 02:19:07.641]  We have another story where on CNN they are calling for Obama to declare, quote, a national state of emergency and just confiscate the guns.
[02:19:07.641 --> 02:19:14.924]  The Daily Beast and other White House connected groups have also in the last month just said, you know what, we do want to take them, just take them.
[02:19:14.924 --> 02:19:17.025]  They've got to know that's going to start a civil war.
[02:19:17.825 --> 02:19:20.868]  If this begins, I mean, so is that really their plan?
[02:19:20.868 --> 02:19:29.998]  And then I want to get back into how we get impeachment going, because obviously, even if we don't get impeachment, which we should, it'll give us a bully pulpit to bring out all their crimes.
[02:19:29.998 --> 02:19:30.459]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:19:31.796 --> 02:19:33.117]  That's exactly right, Alex.
[02:19:33.117 --> 02:19:39.160]  The bully pulpit is a big part of it, but we are seeking impeachment, not just the pulpit.
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:42.162]  And we have been working with a number of legislators.
[02:19:42.162 --> 02:19:54.249]  One of the legislators that has come out with a really good voice here in the last couple of days is, of course, Representative Don Young from the state of Alaska, who is critically concerned about this deprivation of Second Amendment rights.
[02:19:54.249 --> 02:20:00.572]  There are other Republican conservatives in Congress who are also supporting the bill.
[02:20:02.105 --> 02:20:06.528]  What is required is a grass fire that must take place.
[02:20:06.528 --> 02:20:11.911]  And of course, the grass fire begins with the first child who says, hey, the emperor has no clothes.
[02:20:11.911 --> 02:20:14.493]  The reality is that this fire has been lit.
[02:20:14.493 --> 02:20:16.354]  There has been a match struck to the dry hay.
[02:20:18.067 --> 02:20:28.432]  I believe that there's somewhere between 75 and 85 percent of the people in this country that would support impeachment, and that number will grow when you begin to see that this outcome... Oh, I agree.
[02:20:28.432 --> 02:20:33.055]  The CNN polls, you know, that 60 percent support, it's more like 20, 30 percent.
[02:20:33.055 --> 02:20:36.417]  Obama's got below 30 numbers, even with his idiot constituents.
[02:20:36.417 --> 02:20:38.918]  I mean, liberals are coming out in support of Trump and droves.
[02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:45.203]  That's correct, and of course, even the people that are supporting Obama don't know the entire truth.
[02:20:45.203 --> 02:21:07.338]  If they knew the entire truth of what took place in Libya, and the transfer of 200,000 tons of arms into the hands of ISIS, the creation of ISIS by Obama and Hillary, the deployment of ISIS, and all of those crimes that you see ISIS commit, the beheading of Christians, the sale of eight-year-old girls into sex slavery, the trafficking of human beings, the burning of villages, etc., the burning of a pilot alive,
[02:21:08.018 --> 02:21:16.741]  All of those crimes are on the desk of Mr. Obama, who created and funded and deployed this group, and continues to fund and arm them and support them.
[02:21:16.741 --> 02:21:19.442]  That, my friend, is an act of treason.
[02:21:19.442 --> 02:21:30.726]  We've got to do it, and what do we do to put pressure on Paul Ryan and others who keep saying, oh, he's politically, you know, dead right now, we're going to win a landslide.
[02:21:30.726 --> 02:21:31.466]  That's not true.
[02:21:31.466 --> 02:21:32.927]  He could start a war with Russia, anybody.
[02:21:32.927 --> 02:21:35.548]  They're clearly lining up and behaving like
[02:21:36.448 --> 02:21:41.691]  They may go for broke and flooding us with the forces to create terror attacks.
[02:21:41.691 --> 02:21:46.774]  Then Obama declares a state of emergency to respond to the jihadis he himself has brought in.
[02:21:46.774 --> 02:21:57.360]  I mean, Europe's declared civil emergencies using the jihadis they brought in, banning, arresting libertarian leaders like Le Pen, who's number one in the presidential polls.
[02:21:57.360 --> 02:21:59.501]  What they've done in Europe, I think, is the blueprint for here.
[02:22:00.862 --> 02:22:04.805]  I think that's exactly right, except the model is even more draconian than that.
[02:22:04.805 --> 02:22:09.168]  We will not get to a 2016 election if Mr. Obama has his way.
[02:22:09.168 --> 02:22:15.031]  And if he's given free reign to do whatever he will between now and then, we will not make it.
[02:22:15.031 --> 02:22:19.654]  His intentions are, of course, the overthrow of the Constitutional Republic of the United States.
[02:22:19.654 --> 02:22:21.095]  He's in breach of his office.
[02:22:21.095 --> 02:22:27.820]  You can't have supernumerous acts of treason and call it anything other than an intentional overthrow of the country.
[02:22:28.220 --> 02:22:29.962]  That's what's going on here.
[02:22:29.962 --> 02:22:36.508]  And he's being aided and abetted by people in Congress who have full knowledge of these facts and who will do nothing.
[02:22:36.508 --> 02:22:43.074]  Now, there is a federal statute that reiterates what's in the Constitution as to what constitutes treason.
[02:22:43.074 --> 02:22:46.817]  And second to that statute is another statute called misprision of treason.
[02:22:47.583 --> 02:22:58.311]  Those who are aware of the treason that is being committed are guilty of the crime of treason as much as the person who is committed to treason if they take no steps to report it and to act against it.
[02:22:58.311 --> 02:23:00.172]  That's what I said earlier.
[02:23:00.172 --> 02:23:00.592]  They know.
[02:23:00.592 --> 02:23:01.913]  The congressmen know.
[02:23:01.913 --> 02:23:05.656]  There are some that are prepared to act, but they need the support of the people.
[02:23:05.656 --> 02:23:10.379]  Now, the beauty of it is that the RNC is going to come forward with this resolution.
[02:23:10.379 --> 02:23:13.281]  It's trying to be blocked by your ranks.
[02:23:13.281 --> 02:23:14.302]  Please give us the details.
[02:23:14.302 --> 02:23:15.383]  We're going to write a big article, sir.
[02:23:15.543 --> 02:23:22.528]  Again, Mr. Pidgeon, heads up, North American Legal Center.org, very prestigious organization, doing a great job.
[02:23:22.528 --> 02:23:25.790]  You have got Congress people on Osama bin Laden behind the scenes.
[02:23:25.790 --> 02:23:27.912]  It's like going up against Emperor Palpatine, but they're doing it.
[02:23:27.912 --> 02:23:29.133]  They're going up against Hitler.
[02:23:29.133 --> 02:23:30.714]  They are ready to move with this.
[02:23:30.714 --> 02:23:32.195]  Give us the details on how we support it.
[02:23:33.257 --> 02:23:37.759]  Well, the best way to support this is one, you have to contact your RNC delegate.
[02:23:37.759 --> 02:23:39.520]  That's the first step.
[02:23:39.520 --> 02:23:50.745]  And you need to make it clear to the RNC delegate that you're not going to tolerate dictatorial policies from some New World Order elite telling the RNC what they're going to do.
[02:23:50.745 --> 02:23:54.487]  The RNC, for all intents and purposes, has been overthrown by corporate elitists.
[02:23:55.023 --> 02:23:58.665]  Does not represent the Republican or the conservative base.
[02:23:58.665 --> 02:24:12.450]  The Republicans have long held planks that support marriage and that support the traditional family and also are pro-life and want a smaller government, reduced taxes, all the typical conservative Republican planks.
[02:24:12.450 --> 02:24:18.873]  The RNC holds those planks and they operate in direct contravention to their own order.
[02:24:20.023 --> 02:24:27.962]  And they're doing that because they are being controlled by outside forces and the RMC is being dictated to through the likes of Ryan Suprebus.
[02:24:28.652 --> 02:24:39.234]  Who is working diligently to make sure that Mr. Obama is able to move through with his game plan entirely and with no opposition from the Republicans.
[02:24:39.234 --> 02:24:40.775]  They're covering his entire flank.
[02:24:40.775 --> 02:24:49.777]  So getting into how the resolution comes forward, what we do, give us the specifics of the resolution so we can write an article about it, link to your stuff, and really get people pushing it.
[02:24:50.748 --> 02:24:54.290]  The Articles of Impeachment have been online at North American Law Center for some time.
[02:24:54.290 --> 02:24:56.991]  There's 48 articles under three headings.
[02:24:56.991 --> 02:25:01.633]  And that is the resolution that is before the RNC, the Republican National Committee.
[02:25:01.633 --> 02:25:02.954]  Contact your committee member.
[02:25:02.954 --> 02:25:08.156]  In addition, it is critical that you contact your representative in the House of Representatives.
[02:25:08.156 --> 02:25:19.141]  Because what takes place is some representative, any one representative, can enter the Articles of Impeachment in the Judiciary Committee and call for those impeachment articles to move forward.
[02:25:19.141 --> 02:25:19.942]  Like Bob Martin.
[02:25:20.913 --> 02:25:21.553]  That's correct.
[02:25:21.553 --> 02:25:40.741]  And with the support of the people, calling the Judiciary Committee, members of the Judiciary Committee, and calling their representatives, and demanding impeachment, you know, the choices are we either move forward with the rule of law or we are going to be resorting to confronting military force in the hands of Mr. Obama in a ruthless dictatorship in a short period of time.
[02:25:40.741 --> 02:25:42.502]  So, it's time to act.
[02:25:42.502 --> 02:25:45.684]  You need to call your representatives and move forward with articles of impeachment.
[02:25:45.684 --> 02:25:46.284]  Demand
[02:25:46.904 --> 02:25:53.568]  That your representative forget the politics and move forward with these articles of impeachment.
[02:25:53.568 --> 02:25:57.590]  And bear this in mind you representatives that say we don't want to act.
[02:25:57.590 --> 02:26:00.451]  Obama has already targeted you as an enemy.
[02:26:00.451 --> 02:26:05.134]  He's just targeting you as a weak enemy right now because you haven't act.
[02:26:05.134 --> 02:26:05.954]  Now act!
[02:26:05.954 --> 02:26:08.255]  Be a man and do what you're supposed to do.
[02:26:08.255 --> 02:26:13.358]  Stand up for this country and introduce these articles of impeachment while we still have an opportunity.
[02:26:15.472 --> 02:26:21.298]  You're right, and here's the deal, we're not being taken over by like Boss Hog or something just to be a corrupt guy and skim money.
[02:26:21.298 --> 02:26:26.244]  They're going after everybody, the bitter clingers, they hate us, they're scum.
[02:26:26.244 --> 02:26:29.167]  Look at Merkle supporting the rape gangs.
[02:26:29.167 --> 02:26:33.972]  I just can't believe we've allowed this scummy of an elite in that just hate those of us that...
[02:26:35.406 --> 02:26:36.587]  That are for basic freedom.
[02:26:36.587 --> 02:26:40.628]  I mean, we really are in the hands of really evil people right now.
[02:26:40.628 --> 02:26:41.669]  And you're a smart guy.
[02:26:41.669 --> 02:26:42.729]  Your organization's smart.
[02:26:42.729 --> 02:26:44.590]  You talked to a lot of folks in Congress.
[02:26:44.590 --> 02:26:46.530]  I talked to them as well.
[02:26:46.530 --> 02:26:54.113]  I just don't know why the big elites, because I know they're corrupt though, would let something this violent and dangerous in, because it's going to go after them as well.
[02:26:54.113 --> 02:26:56.774]  I mean, this is cancer.
[02:26:56.774 --> 02:26:57.595]  I agree with that.
[02:26:57.595 --> 02:27:03.637]  And you know, the problem is, Alex, is that the theory, and this theory, by the way, was the theory proposed initially by Adolf Hitler.
[02:27:04.369 --> 02:27:10.954]  Which is that National Socialism works better in a Muslim society than it does in a Christian society.
[02:27:10.954 --> 02:27:23.563]  So the concept within the New World Order is to Islamify all of Western society so that the dictatorship will flow more easily and the population will be more easily controlled.
[02:27:23.563 --> 02:27:24.864]  That's the concept.
[02:27:24.864 --> 02:27:32.670]  The elite continue to believe that they'll be living in, you know, high-rises in Manhattan that will be gated in from the Islamic influence because they're ignorant.
[02:27:33.271 --> 02:27:37.778]  They actually expect that National Socialism is going to work, which is also ignorant.
[02:27:37.778 --> 02:27:42.825]  But the reality of it is... The reality is they're in love with power and oppression.
[02:27:43.966 --> 02:27:44.927]  That's exactly right.
[02:27:44.927 --> 02:27:50.134]  They're power-hungry people, and they go to bed at night thinking about how they're going to kill 5 billion human beings.
[02:27:50.134 --> 02:27:51.275]  Look at their top captain!
[02:27:51.275 --> 02:27:56.662]  He's a literal Nazi collaborator who's financing, in 14 countries, Muslims oppressing Christians.
[02:27:56.662 --> 02:27:57.963]  We had an article this week.
[02:27:57.963 --> 02:28:00.927]  I mean, they are just, they are pure evil.
[02:28:00.927 --> 02:28:02.248]  I mean, it's true.
[02:28:02.248 --> 02:28:03.210]  I mean, they really are bad.
[02:28:04.019 --> 02:28:18.905]  That's right, and what they have planned for the United States is control of the population and, of course, the systematic elimination of any people who remember freedom, any people who remember the Constitutional Republic, any people who remember the American way of life.
[02:28:18.905 --> 02:28:20.446]  Those people have to go.
[02:28:20.446 --> 02:28:32.751]  They have to be replaced by subservient slaves who are under the control of some imam somewhere that allows the elite to pluck them and to pluck their wealth and to live in their 1% life while the rest of us starve on the street.
[02:28:33.131 --> 02:28:35.392]  I mean, that's essentially the plan.
[02:28:35.392 --> 02:28:49.255]  And they're financing the whole Black Lives Matter movement, going up against the legitimate police state in some cases, but with a leftist overthrow angle, with UN offices opening this year all over the country for quote, strong cities to bully the takeover of local government.
[02:28:49.255 --> 02:28:55.737]  I mean, this is a total multinational takeover using socialism and radical Islam as the operating system.
[02:28:56.457 --> 02:28:57.259]  That's correct.
[02:28:57.259 --> 02:29:01.225]  And this idea of placing UN offices in the country.
[02:29:01.225 --> 02:29:07.376]  Anyone who is in a foreign uniform in the United States who is armed is at war with the United States.
[02:29:07.376 --> 02:29:08.157]  Period.
[02:29:08.157 --> 02:29:09.639]  Obama is at war with America.
[02:29:10.643 --> 02:29:11.224]  That's correct.
[02:29:11.224 --> 02:29:12.906]  He's declared war on America.
[02:29:12.906 --> 02:29:18.092]  He's executing the Muslim Brotherhood game plan that was published in the early 80s.
[02:29:18.092 --> 02:29:23.158]  Michelle Bachmann came forward with it and acknowledged it to the Department of Intelligence.
[02:29:23.158 --> 02:29:25.481]  Well sir, you absolutely are amazing on target.
[02:29:25.481 --> 02:29:26.602]  NorthAmericanLawCenter.org
[02:29:27.483 --> 02:29:37.147]  I know you're very busy, but I'd like later today to tape several segments with you to get into other angles on the nightly news, or if not, the Sunday show or Monday, because this is moving so quickly.
[02:29:37.147 --> 02:29:41.829]  Stephen Pidgeon, God bless you, sir, and please keep working as hard as you can.
[02:29:41.829 --> 02:29:43.390]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:29:43.390 --> 02:29:44.430]  Appreciate it.
[02:29:44.430 --> 02:29:47.432]  We await congressmen to come on this show and sign on to impeachment.
[02:29:47.432 --> 02:29:48.732]  This is it, boys.
[02:29:48.732 --> 02:29:51.834]  Sign your name on the declaration.
[02:29:51.834 --> 02:29:54.515]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.678 --> 02:30:05.240]  A Missouri bill defines sex between lawmakers and lobbyists as a gift, reports NBC News.
[02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:16.923]  Lobbyists in Missouri who have sex with state lawmakers or their aides would have to disclose that activity to the State Ethics Commission under a bill introduced this week by a Republican state representative.
[02:30:16.923 --> 02:30:27.906]  The measure, pushed by Representative Bart Corman, defines sexual relations between lawmakers and lobbyists as a gift to be reported on the disclosure forms that lobbyists file on a monthly basis.
[02:30:28.266 --> 02:30:32.029]  The bill does not assign a dollar valuation to the gift of sex.
[02:30:32.029 --> 02:30:38.333]  Corman's proposal, reported early Thursday by the Kansas City Star, quickly gained attention on social media.
[02:30:38.333 --> 02:30:46.959]  And Corman told USA Today that he was fielding calls from reporters all across the country, demanding to know more about his unorthodox proposal.
[02:30:46.959 --> 02:30:50.621]  I guess this has gone viral or something, he was quoted as saying.
[02:30:50.621 --> 02:30:54.464]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[02:31:10.152 --> 02:31:15.576]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:31:36.622 --> 02:31:39.924]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:31:39.924 --> 02:31:43.406]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:31:43.406 --> 02:31:45.147]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.

[02:31:58.113 --> 02:32:05.016]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.tv, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[02:32:05.016 --> 02:32:07.897]  We've always offered five months free.
[02:32:07.897 --> 02:32:13.460]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:17.163]  PrisonPlanet.tv began 15 years ago.
[02:32:17.163 --> 02:32:20.506]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[02:32:20.506 --> 02:32:29.494]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:32:29.494 --> 02:32:40.204]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's, you also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously using your username.
[02:32:40.484 --> 02:32:48.029]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95, and then 20 of you and your friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:32:48.029 --> 02:32:50.310]  Get 20 memberships at half price.

[02:33:01.757 --> 02:33:08.442]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:12.148 --> 02:33:21.452]  About a month before they removed Boehner, we had Congressman Walter Jones on and he led the operation to remove John Boehner.
[02:33:21.452 --> 02:33:23.393]  Now we've got Paul Ryan.
[02:33:23.393 --> 02:33:27.615]  And I happen to know behind the scenes, a lot of Congress folks are looking at articles of impeachment.
[02:33:29.389 --> 02:33:34.394]  But they are facing heavy tyranny and a lot of threats.
[02:33:34.394 --> 02:33:36.936]  But Hillary's in a lot of political trouble right now.
[02:33:36.936 --> 02:33:40.199]  More emails, more classified info, more lies to Congress.
[02:33:40.199 --> 02:33:46.205]  The Washington Post and others are coming out talking about Bill Clinton settling rape cases and could he be the new Bill Cosby.
[02:33:46.205 --> 02:33:52.610]  We've got the former candidate, or he was going to be a candidate, coming back saying maybe he will be a candidate, Joe Biden.
[02:33:52.610 --> 02:33:53.952]  So that shows you they're in trouble.
[02:33:55.383 --> 02:34:00.305]  But bottom line, you cannot have the executive order power grabs that are happening right now.
[02:34:00.305 --> 02:34:01.186]  It's unprecedented.
[02:34:01.186 --> 02:34:06.648]  I played clips of candidate and early President Obama saying it's illegal what he's now doing.
[02:34:06.648 --> 02:34:14.191]  Bashing Bush, who deserved to be bashed for some of his executive orders, but Obama signed more executive orders than the last six presidents combined.
[02:34:14.191 --> 02:34:15.952]  They're draconian.
[02:34:15.952 --> 02:34:16.972]  It's dangerous.
[02:34:16.972 --> 02:34:20.074]  And on so many fronts,
[02:34:21.192 --> 02:34:24.874]  This country is in a lot of trouble.
[02:34:24.874 --> 02:34:41.124]  I wanted to get our guest on and he came on on short notice because he's been saying for a couple of years and then six months ago, look for China bubble to burst in December of last year and it started happening actually in about November.
[02:34:42.441 --> 02:34:44.102]  And then he said it's going to accelerate.
[02:34:44.102 --> 02:34:45.463]  I think it's imminent.
[02:34:45.463 --> 02:34:47.844]  And now you've seen just crazy town.
[02:34:47.844 --> 02:34:50.086]  Trillions disappearing in days.
[02:34:50.086 --> 02:34:54.688]  Our stock market going down, you know, a thousand points and going back up.
[02:34:54.688 --> 02:34:58.331]  Just wild numbers.
[02:34:58.331 --> 02:35:01.993]  And so he joins us to speak about this and how it ties into everything.
[02:35:01.993 --> 02:35:03.654]  But stock market crash 2016.
[02:35:03.654 --> 02:35:08.757]  This is the worst start to a year for stocks ever.
[02:35:08.757 --> 02:35:09.938]  That's CNN.
[02:35:09.938 --> 02:35:10.078]  Ever.
[02:35:11.195 --> 02:35:12.076]  Ever.
[02:35:12.076 --> 02:35:14.938]  Worst four, now it's five day run.
[02:35:14.938 --> 02:35:18.921]  And you got Soros hopping up and down saying, you know, this is bigger than 2008.
[02:35:18.921 --> 02:35:21.883]  Will we see new big banker bailouts in some new bubble?
[02:35:21.883 --> 02:35:25.085]  And some new... I mean, it's crazy.
[02:35:25.085 --> 02:35:29.688]  And we got Democrats calling for Obama to declare a national state of emergency on guns.
[02:35:29.688 --> 02:35:34.872]  They have executive orders in place where Congress is suspended for six months.
[02:35:34.872 --> 02:35:37.314]  Those are Bush and Obama executive orders.
[02:35:37.314 --> 02:35:38.975]  I mean, this is scary times, folks.
[02:35:40.273 --> 02:35:48.838]  And I've talked to high-level special forces people that say, though they're being told, get ready for domestic collapse, gun confiscation, you name it, and they say we're not going to follow the orders.
[02:35:48.838 --> 02:35:52.280]  So, this is a crazy time to be alive.
[02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:55.722]  Our news websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:35:55.722 --> 02:36:03.606]  If you're not sending out our videos and links to what we're doing and the free podcast and everything else, whose side are you on?
[02:36:03.606 --> 02:36:08.029]  And by the way, I know you are because, again, our average video
[02:36:09.150 --> 02:36:10.191]  We're good to go.
[02:36:30.708 --> 02:36:33.471]  Because the economy's in the crap, obviously.
[02:36:33.471 --> 02:36:34.792]  Most talk radio is going bankrupt.
[02:36:34.792 --> 02:36:35.152]  We're not.
[02:36:35.152 --> 02:36:37.094]  We've been trying to expand in the face of tyranny.
[02:36:37.094 --> 02:36:50.107]  But I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com and look at the great shortwave radios, great non-GMO seeds, great Patriot apparel, super high-quality, game-changing nutraceuticals with 4.8 star reviews on third-party sites, 15% off.

[02:36:55.197 --> 02:36:56.838]  Six months free.
[02:36:56.838 --> 02:36:57.899]  We've never done that.
[02:36:57.899 --> 02:36:59.620]  And we're getting record members as well.
[02:36:59.620 --> 02:37:01.722]  The PrisonPlanet.tv and the Nightly News.
[02:37:01.722 --> 02:37:02.822]  That's going to end next week.
[02:37:02.822 --> 02:37:04.043]  It's a New Year's special.
[02:37:04.043 --> 02:37:06.144]  Twenty people can use each membership.
[02:37:06.144 --> 02:37:07.085]  Take advantage of this.
[02:37:07.085 --> 02:37:10.387]  I want to salute and thank the folks that have been supporting us.
[02:37:10.387 --> 02:37:13.389]  We have a limited edition calendars for 2016.
[02:37:13.389 --> 02:37:15.911]  We're going to Mr. Dent right now.
[02:37:15.911 --> 02:37:20.454]  It's just very important for folks to realize the iron is hot now.
[02:37:22.170 --> 02:37:32.614]  And we need you to spread the word, we need you to support us financially, and pray for us, and pray for this country and the world, because we are entering one of the most tumultuous times in human history, I believe.
[02:37:32.614 --> 02:37:35.095]  All the graphs, the demographic cliffs show it.
[02:37:35.095 --> 02:37:44.518]  You have the cultural decay, the laziness of the West, the militants, the weapons all over the world, the Pentagon, the Ministry of Defense, they say 2016 to 2022 is going to be over the top wild.
[02:37:49.733 --> 02:37:50.854]  Don't strap yourselves in.
[02:37:50.854 --> 02:37:52.335]  You don't want to be a spectator in this.
[02:37:52.335 --> 02:37:53.256]  You want to be involved.
[02:37:53.256 --> 02:37:55.879]  The worst place to be is a spectator.
[02:37:55.879 --> 02:37:57.160]  This is not a spectator sport.
[02:37:57.160 --> 02:37:57.961]  So there's my intro.
[02:37:57.961 --> 02:37:59.442]  He joins us till the end of the hour.
[02:37:59.442 --> 02:38:03.105]  Then Anthony Gutiard will be hosting a live fourth hour.
[02:38:03.105 --> 02:38:12.394]  And I really appreciate our routine guest who comes on every few weeks now, Harry Dent, author of The Demographic Cliff, a former top guy, of course over
[02:38:12.694 --> 02:38:14.655]  They're doing big corporate turnarounds.
[02:38:14.655 --> 02:38:16.676]  I like that, not just takeovers.
[02:38:16.676 --> 02:38:22.219]  For Bain Capital, harrydent.com, Harvard Business School graduate and more.
[02:38:22.219 --> 02:38:23.740]  I'm not going to go over the rest of it.
[02:38:23.740 --> 02:38:25.180]  People know who he is.
[02:38:25.180 --> 02:38:29.103]  And he's also offering a deal steal where you just pay the shipping and get his book free.
[02:38:29.103 --> 02:38:31.184]  That's how much he wants to get it out for you.
[02:38:31.184 --> 02:38:32.604]  It's like $4.95 or something.
[02:38:32.604 --> 02:38:33.725]  I know he loses money on that.
[02:38:33.725 --> 02:38:37.387]  The book costs that to just get it into your hands, the demographic cliff.
[02:38:37.387 --> 02:38:37.667]  Okay.
[02:38:38.007 --> 02:38:40.130]  We've gone over the charts, we've covered a lot of that.
[02:38:40.130 --> 02:38:46.358]  The point is, what you've said is basically happening just as you said it would, just as your last predictions came early true.
[02:38:46.358 --> 02:38:54.829]  Tell us what's happening currently, and then what you expect now that the optics are closer and clearer for the electron microscope, what the next shoe to drop is, Mr. Dent.
[02:38:55.666 --> 02:39:01.313]  Well, again, I've been looking at China, number one, because they have the greatest bubble in the world.
[02:39:01.313 --> 02:39:05.960]  They have overbuilt their economy for 12 to 15 years in the future.
[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:09.404]  Massive migration into cities where people don't really have jobs.
[02:39:09.404 --> 02:39:11.267]  They have them building stuff for nobody.
[02:39:11.947 --> 02:39:15.809]  And that's what they've been doing for 15 years.
[02:39:15.809 --> 02:39:17.810]  I have never seen a bubble that compared to this.
[02:39:17.810 --> 02:39:24.532]  So I'm saying, look, we have a bubble around the world in demographic spending, which keeps declining in more countries.
[02:39:24.532 --> 02:39:26.893]  And we can predict this by country.
[02:39:26.893 --> 02:39:27.914]  Japan was the first.
[02:39:28.134 --> 02:39:29.135]  We're good to go.
[02:39:53.716 --> 02:39:54.656]  And this is happening.
[02:39:54.656 --> 02:40:06.780]  I've been looking at China, number one, because it had the greatest stock bubble in the shortest period of time with the least sophisticated investors who were jumping out of the real estate bubble there to get into the stock bubble.
[02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:07.961]  And now it's collapsing.
[02:40:07.961 --> 02:40:12.822]  And the government is doing the same thing, Alex, it did in 1929 when the U.S.
[02:40:12.822 --> 02:40:14.143]  stock bubble started to burst.
[02:40:15.191 --> 02:40:28.043]  Both bubbles went down 42% in two and a half months, and then the government steps in and starts buying its own stock market to try to prop it up, and it only lasts about four months before the bubbles collapse and get worse.
[02:40:28.043 --> 02:40:31.867]  You cannot stop a bubble from bursting once you create it.
[02:40:31.867 --> 02:40:36.652]  The only way you can stop a bubble is not to create it in the first place, and nobody gets that.
[02:40:37.032 --> 02:40:38.994]  We are in a bubble around the world.
[02:40:38.994 --> 02:40:42.899]  Commodities we've been predicting for years have already collapsed.
[02:40:42.899 --> 02:40:45.782]  Nobody thought oil would be at $32 a barrel.
[02:40:45.782 --> 02:40:49.906]  We said it would be $20 to $30 a barrel years ago.
[02:40:49.906 --> 02:40:51.268]  Nobody thought that
[02:40:52.805 --> 02:40:54.146]  You know, the U.S.
[02:40:54.146 --> 02:40:56.789]  bubble would burst in real estate in 2005.
[02:40:56.789 --> 02:40:57.930]  We said it'll burst.
[02:40:57.930 --> 02:40:59.452]  Now it's going to burst more.
[02:40:59.452 --> 02:41:04.176]  So investors and people need to say, look, we've had this great bubble.
[02:41:04.176 --> 02:41:08.981]  It's been artificially stimulated by governments around the world, especially the Fed here in the United States.
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:18.083]  Take your gains from the bubble and turn it back into cash and liquidity so you can survive this crash that's going to happen.
[02:41:18.083 --> 02:41:21.305]  It is going to be worse, and we just said this in our January newsletter.
[02:41:21.305 --> 02:41:23.445]  2016 is going to go down, I think, is the
[02:41:25.066 --> 02:41:26.187]  We're good to go.
[02:41:44.105 --> 02:41:50.750]  So you're saying we're facing another Great Depression, generally, or the same numbers in the stock market?
[02:42:01.550 --> 02:42:08.235]  Y'all, actually we're facing a bigger crash than 2008, which was about 55% in 17 months.
[02:42:08.235 --> 02:42:15.681]  I think we're going to see 70% in the next year, year and a half, and ultimately a little more than that down the road.
[02:42:15.681 --> 02:42:18.082]  We are going to see a Great Depression.
[02:42:18.082 --> 02:42:28.130]  We started to see the Great Depression, which I forecast back in 2007 and 8, we started to see... So you're saying the new Great Depression is basically months away?
[02:42:28.979 --> 02:42:34.124]  Yeah, I think it's going to happen between this year, 2016, and 2020.
[02:42:34.124 --> 02:42:37.027]  And they're getting ready to take the guns on top of it.
[02:42:37.027 --> 02:42:39.229]  I'll tell you, this is a recipe for just explosions.
[02:42:39.229 --> 02:42:40.991]  Please continue.
[02:42:40.991 --> 02:42:41.772]  Yeah, and again...
[02:42:43.266 --> 02:42:46.589]  People don't realize, nobody's seen this happen in their lifetime.
[02:42:46.589 --> 02:43:00.400]  The last time we had a bubble burst in debt and financial assets, stocks, commodities, real estate, everything, was in the early 30s and the stock market went down 89% in two and a half years.
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:03.022]  Real estate went down 26%, 61% in New York, never came back for decades.
[02:43:03.022 --> 02:43:04.203]  Stocks didn't come back for 25 years.
[02:43:08.966 --> 02:43:12.469]  This is something major you have to get out of the way of this.
[02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:23.899]  It's a matter of survival and then when these bubbles burst whether it's real estate in New York or beachfront property in Florida or anywhere else you're going to be able to buy stuff
[02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:41.426]  No, I understand you're about surviving and thriving in bad times, but getting back to your demographic cliff, all your charts, the things you used at Bain to be able to successfully predict things in all your best-selling books.
[02:43:42.026 --> 02:43:47.769]  Specifically, I mean, you know, because at a certain point it does get down to tea leaves on exact times.
[02:43:47.769 --> 02:43:49.110]  Two months, three months, six months.
[02:43:49.110 --> 02:43:50.590]  I mean, we'll be in a great depression.
[02:43:50.590 --> 02:43:51.871]  They'll be telling us everything's great.
[02:43:51.871 --> 02:43:53.832]  Like they tell us Obamacare is free.
[02:43:53.832 --> 02:43:58.675]  But how deep will this have to get before they admit it's a depression?
[02:43:58.675 --> 02:44:01.376]  I mean, obviously, most third world countries are already in a depression.
[02:44:01.376 --> 02:44:02.156]  They're in flames.
[02:44:03.457 --> 02:44:04.718]  There is a global depression.
[02:44:04.718 --> 02:44:05.939]  It's just not evenly distributed.
[02:44:05.939 --> 02:44:08.160]  But how long until it hits here?
[02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:13.863]  How bad will it be distributed, say, here versus Australia versus China versus Europe versus Russia?
[02:44:13.863 --> 02:44:14.904]  Where are the worst places?
[02:44:14.904 --> 02:44:16.425]  Where are the best places?
[02:44:16.425 --> 02:44:20.027]  OK, first of all, we've been waiting for a long time to see.
[02:44:20.027 --> 02:44:27.711]  I mean, the governments have been keeping this bubble going by printing trillions of dollars, like 10, 12 trillion dollars in the last several years.
[02:44:27.711 --> 02:44:29.432]  They've been filling in the downturn.
[02:44:29.432 --> 02:44:30.293]  They didn't do that in the 1930s.
[02:44:30.293 --> 02:44:30.693]  So in the 1930s,
[02:44:32.734 --> 02:44:37.820]  The stock market peaked in 1929 when demographics would have said it would, and it just went down.
[02:44:37.820 --> 02:44:45.410]  Well, no, they've kept this bubble going, but we've been looking for the final signs where I call the smart money.
[02:44:45.410 --> 02:44:47.012]  It is exiting the market.
[02:44:47.012 --> 02:44:52.138]  This happens when the largest companies like Google and Apple and Netflix
[02:44:52.498 --> 02:44:58.301]  And Amazon are going straight up, and most companies, 80% of the companies are going down.
[02:44:58.301 --> 02:45:06.624]  The average company in the stock industry is down 20% right now, while these big companies are making new highs at unbelievable valuations.
[02:45:06.624 --> 02:45:10.846]  That is the sign that the bubble's finally peaking.
[02:45:10.846 --> 02:45:12.987]  And so I think this bubble's gonna burst.
[02:45:12.987 --> 02:45:14.628]  It's starting to burst now.
[02:45:14.628 --> 02:45:19.510]  To have December and January be the worst in decades,
[02:45:20.146 --> 02:45:23.367]  Well, you've been right over and over and over again.
[02:45:23.367 --> 02:45:32.150]  It's a sickening feeling, because I don't want you to be right, but I mean, you're one of the most accurate people out there, and I'm not just saying that.
[02:45:32.150 --> 02:45:33.250]  People can all witness it.
[02:45:48.777 --> 02:45:49.518]  I wish you were wrong.
[02:45:49.518 --> 02:45:57.544]  What do you say, just because I have to do this, to the naysayers, and they even do this in mainstream media, New York Times, oh, we're fear porn.
[02:45:57.544 --> 02:46:02.288]  Oh, you know, we're going to, or we're going to cause a crash by saying all this.
[02:46:02.288 --> 02:46:06.571]  That's like saying, well, you caused Bernie Madoff to go under because you pointed out he was a fraud.
[02:46:06.571 --> 02:46:08.733]  You know, the fraudsters are okay.
[02:46:08.733 --> 02:46:10.174]  The derivative sellers are okay.
[02:46:10.174 --> 02:46:13.837]  Those of us that point out historical trends, we're bad.
[02:46:13.837 --> 02:46:14.938]  How do you respond to that?
[02:46:15.818 --> 02:46:19.522]  Well, first of all, I was the most bullish economist in all of U.S.
[02:46:19.522 --> 02:46:24.047]  history from the late 80s forward because I saw this massive baby boom coming.
[02:46:24.047 --> 02:46:30.273]  They're the largest generation in history, the largest since the American Revolution back 250 years ago.
[02:46:30.273 --> 02:46:34.877]  And these people were going to predictably cause the greatest boom and bubble.
[02:46:34.877 --> 02:46:37.039]  You want to be you want to be bullish.
[02:46:37.039 --> 02:46:39.242]  But I mean, the fact is, this is the season of the bear.
[02:46:39.946 --> 02:46:41.006]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[02:46:41.006 --> 02:46:42.447]  But we had that boom.
[02:46:42.447 --> 02:46:44.548]  And the baby boom first peaked in Japan.
[02:46:44.548 --> 02:46:46.928]  That's why I called my book The Demographic Clip.
[02:46:46.928 --> 02:46:51.310]  The first baby boom to peak was in Japan in the late 80s, the mid-90s.
[02:46:51.310 --> 02:46:52.510]  They fell off the cliff.
[02:46:52.510 --> 02:46:53.951]  Look at Japan ever since.
[02:46:53.951 --> 02:46:54.731]  They've been down.
[02:46:54.731 --> 02:46:57.472]  Their stock market's still 55% off their highs.
[02:46:57.472 --> 02:46:59.373]  Real estate's down 60%.
[02:46:59.373 --> 02:47:00.193]  Never recovered.
[02:47:00.433 --> 02:47:02.354]  And I don't think giant third world right gangs are going to replace them.
[02:47:23.496 --> 02:47:24.836]  Yeah, no, exactly.
[02:47:24.836 --> 02:47:26.617]  I mean, you can't fight demographics.
[02:47:26.617 --> 02:47:43.242]  But the worst thing, Alex, is that when times are good, especially when the Fed jumps in and makes interest rates low and tells everybody to buy a house whether they want it or not, you get these bubbles in speculation and real estate and stocks and debt.
[02:47:44.073 --> 02:47:59.218]  And this debt bubble is, when you count all the unfunded liabilities for health care, and social security, and government debt, and private debt, and people worry about $18 trillion in government debt, that is the least of our problems.
[02:47:59.218 --> 02:48:00.439]  I agree.
[02:48:00.439 --> 02:48:05.160]  We have so much more debt, like eight times our GDP, at the minimum.
[02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:07.501]  Well, how many quadrillions are there in derivatives?
[02:48:08.479 --> 02:48:10.760]  Oh, 70 trillion just in that.
[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:14.141]  I mean, and derivatives are total speculation.
[02:48:14.141 --> 02:48:16.762]  They're supposed to be insurance against bonds and stuff.
[02:48:16.762 --> 02:48:18.222]  There's no collateral.
[02:48:18.222 --> 02:48:20.443]  Real insurance has collateral behind it.
[02:48:20.443 --> 02:48:22.844]  So this is just another way to speculate.
[02:48:22.844 --> 02:48:27.446]  Another way for Wall Street to say, oh, you don't have to worry about all these risks and bubbles.
[02:48:27.446 --> 02:48:28.306]  We've got it insured.
[02:48:28.306 --> 02:48:29.647]  You got it insured by who?
[02:48:29.647 --> 02:48:31.847]  Speculators on 30 times leverage.
[02:48:31.847 --> 02:48:33.548]  As soon as something goes wrong, they're broke.
[02:48:33.888 --> 02:48:35.650]  They're not going to be able to stand behind these guys.
[02:48:35.650 --> 02:48:36.751]  Demographically, too.
[02:48:36.751 --> 02:48:39.554]  How bad will crime get during a depression?
[02:48:39.554 --> 02:48:40.735]  Okay.
[02:48:40.735 --> 02:48:53.267]  I look back in the 1930s, Alex, and any time in history, crime and unemployment are directly correlated, and stock crashes and suicides are directly correlated.
[02:48:53.880 --> 02:49:06.450]  So crime and homicides were the highest in 1933 when unemployment was the highest in the Great Depression, and suicides were the highest in mid to late 1932 when the stock market bottomed.
[02:49:06.450 --> 02:49:17.458]  So you're going to see civil unrest, you're going to see rising crime, but it's going to come from rising unemployment after this big bubble's been built.
[02:49:17.458 --> 02:49:20.681]  And if you think it's bad in the United States, imagine
[02:49:21.241 --> 02:49:38.193]  A half a billion, I'm talking, I said a half a billion migrants, uneducated migrants from rural areas in China that only in the last 15 years have moved into cities and they're building stuff for nobody and when that building boom stops, what are these people going to do?
[02:49:38.193 --> 02:49:40.315]  You're going to have a half a billion people.
[02:49:43.149 --> 02:49:49.156]  China already had more than 50 million people it's estimated since Mao took over starved to death.
[02:49:49.156 --> 02:49:51.119]  Can you imagine the starvation this time?
[02:49:51.889 --> 02:49:57.916]  Yeah, I mean, I worry, I don't worry, is Europe has worse demographics than the United States.
[02:49:57.916 --> 02:49:59.879]  You said, you know, where's it going to be the worst?
[02:49:59.879 --> 02:50:11.372]  East Asia, Japan, but in the United States we have much more income inequality and China has this massive migration that's never been properly assimilated and
[02:50:12.794 --> 02:50:18.922]  I hate to say, the one thing about Europe is they have, their immigrants, especially the Muslims, are not as integrated.
[02:50:18.922 --> 02:50:19.883]  Nowhere near as here.
[02:50:19.883 --> 02:50:25.510]  So you're going to see, I think, civil unrest on a level we haven't seen in our lifetime.
[02:50:25.510 --> 02:50:28.033]  And I hate to say that, but it's just like... No, it's true.
[02:50:28.033 --> 02:50:29.935]  We're sitting on top of Road Warrior time bomb.
[02:50:29.935 --> 02:50:30.355]  Good God.
[02:50:32.537 --> 02:50:36.698]  It's clear, we're steaming towards it, whether it's a month, six months, a year.
[02:50:36.698 --> 02:50:40.980]  When we come back, I want to specifically, when you think they're going to be able to stop denying it.
[02:50:40.980 --> 02:50:45.321]  You answered most of the question, I appreciate that, but Mr. Dent, when is it going to be clear?
[02:50:45.321 --> 02:50:47.722]  Because, man, they can mind control the public, folks.
[02:50:47.722 --> 02:50:51.024]  You can have a thousand German women raped and they'll say it didn't happen.
[02:50:51.024 --> 02:50:54.925]  So, you can have a depression and they'll tell you, you know, you didn't build your business.
[02:50:54.925 --> 02:50:57.006]  I mean, this is the age of two plus two equals five.
[02:50:58.669 --> 02:51:00.230]  Are you looking to sell body armor?

[02:54:01.730 --> 02:54:11.069]  Alright, I'm going to speak about the whole state of the world, that little five minute segment coming up, and then Anthony Guicciardi is going to host the fourth hour with the same situation, the gun grab that's going on.
[02:54:12.509 --> 02:54:27.525]  The power grabbing, the open borders, just the lawlessness, the establishment obviously scurrying around getting ready for political upheaval and trying to exacerbate it as much as they can, I guess to use the crisis to get even more power.
[02:54:27.525 --> 02:54:31.430]  But getting past all that, what are we going to do individually?
[02:54:31.430 --> 02:54:33.932]  Looking at the United States and the rest of the world.
[02:54:36.007 --> 02:54:41.470]  They're pretty much signaling now that things are in big trouble, global implosion.
[02:54:41.470 --> 02:54:57.381]  If you say it's as bad as the Great Depression, you add all the bigger populations, all the fact that Tower of Babel, you were just mentioning, people don't get along as well, we don't have more homogeneous populations anywhere, you know, in other parts of the world as well.
[02:54:57.381 --> 02:54:59.182]  What does that signal and what's the timeframe?
[02:55:00.438 --> 02:55:07.102]  Well, again, I think the worst year is going to be 2016, early 2017, the next year or a little more.
[02:55:07.102 --> 02:55:12.286]  I think that's when the stock crash is going to hit the hardest, just like it did in 2008.
[02:55:12.286 --> 02:55:20.611]  It happened in 17 months and 80% of that stock crash happened in five months between June and early November 2008.
[02:55:20.611 --> 02:55:21.832]  It's going to be like that.
[02:55:21.832 --> 02:55:24.053]  Stocks are going to get hit the worst, the fastest.
[02:55:24.053 --> 02:55:26.375]  Real estate is going to take years to come down.
[02:55:27.055 --> 02:55:28.736]  Businesses are going to go under.
[02:55:28.736 --> 02:55:41.959]  So if you've got a business and you're thinking of retiring, you should sell your business now or you should hunker down to survive and know that if you are leaner and meaner than your competitors, you're going to come out of this ahead.
[02:55:41.959 --> 02:55:44.060]  If you've got stocks, you should sell them.
[02:55:44.580 --> 02:55:48.642]  I mean, people say, oh, but I got Procter & Gamble and it's got a high dividend.
[02:55:48.642 --> 02:55:49.922]  I don't care.
[02:55:49.922 --> 02:55:55.225]  Even in the Great Depression, companies like Procter & Gamble went down 50, 60, 70, 80 percent.
[02:55:55.225 --> 02:55:57.466]  And some companies stopped paying the dividend.
[02:55:57.466 --> 02:56:01.107]  So if you want a dividend, get a 30-year treasury bond.
[02:56:01.107 --> 02:56:02.748]  That is the safest thing you can buy.
[02:56:02.748 --> 02:56:04.149]  And people keep saying the U.S.
[02:56:04.149 --> 02:56:05.529]  dollar is going to go down.
[02:56:05.529 --> 02:56:07.890]  No, we're the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[02:56:07.890 --> 02:56:09.931]  And that's been proven over several years.
[02:56:09.931 --> 02:56:10.952]  And we've been saying that as well.
[02:56:10.952 --> 02:56:11.652]  So get safe.
[02:56:12.361 --> 02:56:13.162]  Yeah, it didn't stop.
[02:56:13.162 --> 02:56:15.163]  Just protect your wealth.
[02:56:15.163 --> 02:56:30.774]  The key to prospering in a deflationary downturn like this, which only comes once in a lifetime, like the 1930s, and nobody's alive to tell us about that, is that you protect your wealth and then reinvest after the bubbles burst.
[02:56:30.774 --> 02:56:31.755]  Let me expand on that.
[02:56:31.755 --> 02:56:33.977]  What about more speculative things?
[02:56:33.977 --> 02:56:38.500]  What do you see, because Bitcoin's up right now, what do you see happening deeper into this with things like Bitcoin?
[02:56:39.141 --> 02:56:46.148]  You know, no, Bitcoin, I think, is the beginning of something in the future, but it's not established yet, and it's just as volatile as gold.
[02:56:46.148 --> 02:56:50.372]  I wouldn't be buying Bitcoin, and even more, I wouldn't be buying gold.
[02:56:50.372 --> 02:56:59.361]  Gold did great in the 70s when inflation was the trend, but with deflation and debt deleveraging the trend, gold keeps going down.
[02:56:59.361 --> 02:57:01.603]  I've got reports on this off the charts.
[02:57:02.183 --> 02:57:04.686]  It's just unbelievable that people don't understand.
[02:57:04.686 --> 02:57:07.289]  People think gold is a crisis hedge.
[02:57:07.289 --> 02:57:11.154]  It's an inflation hedge and we're not dealing with inflation.
[02:57:11.154 --> 02:57:18.182]  How could we have such low inflation after $12 trillion was printed around the world by that central bank?
[02:57:18.182 --> 02:57:19.343]  It's because they're printing
[02:57:19.343 --> 02:57:19.803]  I think so.
[02:57:37.512 --> 02:57:38.933]  Everything else went down.
[02:57:38.933 --> 02:57:48.179]  And that's what I have to keep telling people, Alex, that this is not like the 1970s or other recessions we've had, where some things go up, some things go down.
[02:57:48.179 --> 02:57:54.124]  In a bubble burst like this, everything goes down, except for the primary.
[02:57:54.124 --> 02:57:55.965]  So by what time next year will it be evident?
[02:57:56.918 --> 02:58:07.801]  I think between now and July, you're going to see the first big crash, not a small, we've only seen small crashes thus far around China and oil.
[02:58:07.801 --> 02:58:08.761]  We've been warning.
[02:58:08.761 --> 02:58:10.362]  Those are the two things to look at.
[02:58:10.362 --> 02:58:12.222]  When oil prices go down, watch out.
[02:58:12.222 --> 02:58:14.583]  And when China stocks go down, watch out.
[02:58:14.583 --> 02:58:16.843]  I think you're going to see the first crash by July.
[02:58:16.843 --> 02:58:20.244]  And I think you're going to see the worst of it by late 2016, early to mid 2017.
[02:58:20.244 --> 02:58:21.344]  It will last
[02:58:23.965 --> 02:58:27.286]  Not beyond that up and down, but you're going to see the worst there.
[02:58:27.286 --> 02:58:29.427]  And so this is the year to protect yourself.
[02:58:29.427 --> 02:58:32.387]  After that, it's going to be easier to deal with this.
[02:58:32.387 --> 02:58:34.328]  All right, Mr. Dent, HarryDent.com.
[02:58:34.328 --> 02:58:35.548]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:35.548 --> 02:58:36.128]  Have a good weekend.
[02:58:36.128 --> 02:58:36.949]  Thank you for the time.

[02:58:43.851 --> 02:58:44.671]  Trying to warn everybody.
[02:58:48.382 --> 02:58:51.884]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:58:51.884 --> 02:59:00.149]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:00.149 --> 02:59:05.553]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:05.553 --> 02:59:08.094]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:59:22.769 --> 02:59:26.930]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.

[02:59:43.454 --> 02:59:45.274]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:50.949 --> 02:59:53.586]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.306 --> 03:00:13.828]  The world is a dangerous place.
[03:00:13.828 --> 03:00:19.811]  Not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:00:19.811 --> 03:00:24.154]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:24.154 --> 03:00:28.336]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:00:28.336 --> 03:00:30.437]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.437 --> 03:00:37.081]  Take the children and yourself and hide out in the cellar.
[03:00:37.081 --> 03:00:39.723]  By now the fighting will be cold.
[03:00:42.398 --> 03:00:53.183]  Think of all those people who told you there was no planetary corporate takeover plan.
[03:00:53.183 --> 03:00:55.244]  No FEMA camps.
[03:00:55.244 --> 03:00:57.966]  No forced inoculations.
[03:00:57.966 --> 03:01:00.927]  No smart cars that tax you by the mile.
[03:01:00.927 --> 03:01:06.510]  No government plan to take over your families and claim your children belong to the state.
[03:01:06.510 --> 03:01:12.073]  If the government wasn't involved with Al-Qaeda or ISIS, now it's all admitted.
[03:01:15.615 --> 03:01:19.598]  Can you hear me is the question.
[03:01:19.598 --> 03:01:23.441]  Can you hear me?
[03:01:23.441 --> 03:01:26.843]  Don't believe in the church or the state.
[03:01:26.843 --> 03:01:31.607]  Believe in me, I'm with the high command.
[03:01:31.607 --> 03:01:34.069]  Just inside the doorway.
[03:01:34.069 --> 03:01:37.591]  I'm getting my guns ready.
[03:01:37.591 --> 03:01:42.415]  Always got them ready, but I've been getting them extra ready.
[03:01:42.415 --> 03:01:44.437]  Right here, all day, on the table.
[03:01:50.342 --> 03:01:56.204]  That's right, that's what'll guide you, not the mainstream media.
[03:01:56.204 --> 03:01:58.844]  Spirit.
[03:01:58.844 --> 03:02:09.187]  And the Spirit's gonna get a lot stronger, because when evil comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it.
[03:02:09.187 --> 03:02:13.128]  Now is the time to get serious.
[03:02:13.128 --> 03:02:14.969]  They say we rise to the occasion.
[03:02:15.911 --> 03:02:17.472]  And I know that's what many people have been doing.
[03:02:17.472 --> 03:02:18.772]  And I know I've been doing that as well.
[03:02:18.772 --> 03:02:19.772]  I've been working harder.
[03:02:19.772 --> 03:02:22.053]  I've been more focused.
[03:02:22.053 --> 03:02:24.234]  I have been healthier.
[03:02:24.234 --> 03:02:33.137]  I've been angrier, but overall in a better psychological position.
[03:02:33.137 --> 03:02:39.019]  Because I realize that we really are right about what we're doing.
[03:02:39.019 --> 03:02:41.099]  It really is cut and dry.
[03:02:41.099 --> 03:02:42.900]  We really are facing very bad people.
[03:02:46.121 --> 03:02:49.905]  That have it out for us.
[03:02:49.905 --> 03:03:09.443]  And trying to suck up to them, once there's a real takeover, means in many cases you're actually the first people they dine on.
[03:03:09.443 --> 03:03:11.085]  But a lot of these elites are cowards.
[03:03:12.819 --> 03:03:19.184]  And so they crouch down and lick the greater hands that feed them.
[03:03:19.184 --> 03:03:28.012]  And just to quote Patrick Henry, I say, look, may your change set lightly upon you.
[03:03:28.012 --> 03:03:37.780]  You know, to an engineered, conditioned, brainwashed minion of the system, an Obama supporter, a radio TV host with a 357 Magnum in his hand,
[03:03:40.131 --> 03:03:42.333]  And I have this because it's very accurate.
[03:03:42.333 --> 03:03:54.402]  When you actually got adrenaline going, you're not going to have mistakes, you're not going to have misfires, you're not going to have problems statistically.
[03:03:54.402 --> 03:04:01.168]  They can see Obama with 50 Secret Service or Michael Moore with six armed guards and they just feel good about that.
[03:04:01.168 --> 03:04:06.492]  They see a fellow slave with a gun and they recoil because subconsciously they see you as food.
[03:04:08.131 --> 03:04:12.813]  The minions, they see themselves as dictators with their daddy.
[03:04:12.813 --> 03:04:16.755]  And they don't like seeing you off the plantation, off the reservation.
[03:04:16.755 --> 03:04:18.936]  They want to make sure you're in line.
[03:04:18.936 --> 03:04:21.258]  Well, we're not in line with our own destruction.
[03:04:21.258 --> 03:04:23.819]  We're not going to crouch down and lick your boots.
[03:04:23.819 --> 03:04:25.139]  We're going to die on our feet.
[03:04:25.139 --> 03:04:32.583]  And by the way, history shows when we get ready to die on our feet, the bad guys really start doing the dying.
[03:04:32.583 --> 03:04:34.744]  They've taken our restraint and our kindness for weakness.
[03:04:36.291 --> 03:04:43.939]  But as history shows over and over again, in the end, they will beg.
[03:04:43.939 --> 03:04:49.805]  We're winning the info war, so the enemy wants to overturn the tables.
[03:04:49.805 --> 03:04:56.211]  Intensify everything you do, and spread the word about beacons of truth, like your lives depend on it.
[03:04:56.211 --> 03:04:57.453]  Because my friends, they do.
[03:04:58.900 --> 03:05:06.466]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com, overflow crowd for Donald Trump in Bernie Sanders' backyard, article up by the New York Times.
[03:05:06.466 --> 03:05:18.516]  Donald J. Trump touchdown in one of America's most progressive cities Thursday night, bringing the bombastic message that has captivated Republican voters into the backyard of a Democratic opponent.
[03:05:18.516 --> 03:05:21.558]  Senator Bernie, let's give it all away, Sanders of Vermont.
[03:05:21.858 --> 03:05:40.987]  This visit came as a billionaire real estate mogul has made a point of broadening his focus beyond the early primary states, showcasing his popularity with packed rallies from Mississippi to Massachusetts, and now Vermont, a one-time Republican bastion that is now one of the most solid liberal states in the nation.
[03:05:41.167 --> 03:05:46.755]  The choice of venue seemed curious to some, but Thursday's rally served multiple purposes for the Trump campaign.
[03:05:46.755 --> 03:05:54.205]  Needling Mr. Sanders in his own neighborhood, garnering attention in nearby New Hampshire, which holds the nation's first primary next month.
[03:05:54.205 --> 03:05:57.090]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[03:05:57.090 --> 03:05:57.770]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[03:05:58.271 --> 03:06:05.175]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered 6 months free at Christmas.
[03:06:05.175 --> 03:06:08.056]  We've always offered 5 months free.
[03:06:08.056 --> 03:06:13.979]  But since I announced 6 free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[03:06:13.979 --> 03:06:15.700]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[03:06:17.381 --> 03:06:20.682]  It's grown into Infowars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[03:06:20.682 --> 03:06:29.646]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:29.646 --> 03:06:38.509]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's, you also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously.
[03:06:38.809 --> 03:06:40.631]  Using your username.
[03:06:40.631 --> 03:06:48.197]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95 and then 20 of you and your friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:06:48.197 --> 03:06:50.279]  Get 20 memberships at half price.

[03:06:58.180 --> 03:06:59.801]  It has happened.
[03:06:59.801 --> 03:07:02.202]  2015 has passed into history.
[03:07:02.202 --> 03:07:03.423]  Into lore.
[03:07:03.423 --> 03:07:06.745]  But now, 2016 has been born.
[03:07:06.745 --> 03:07:11.788]  And the decision lies in your hands to forge the destiny!
[03:07:11.788 --> 03:07:12.808]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[03:07:12.808 --> 03:07:17.411]  That's a little too epic, that Hollywood action-adventure-science-fiction voice I'm using.
[03:07:17.411 --> 03:07:25.736]  But quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real, natural nutrients it needs.
[03:07:25.976 --> 03:07:32.661]  And that's why we're offering the biggest discount ever on three of our best-selling products that turbocharge and cleanse the body.

[03:07:51.215 --> 03:07:51.675]  And see?
[03:07:51.675 --> 03:07:52.576]  I just did it again.
[03:07:52.576 --> 03:07:54.077]  I can't help but get excited.
[03:07:54.077 --> 03:07:54.857]  Get healthy!
[03:07:54.857 --> 03:08:05.823]  Fight the globalists!
[03:08:05.823 --> 03:08:09.205]  Win-win!
[03:08:09.205 --> 03:08:11.046]  Yeah!
[03:08:11.046 --> 03:08:13.728]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:08:13.728 --> 03:08:16.689]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:08:16.689 --> 03:08:18.930]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:08:20.450 --> 03:08:25.492]  It's the fourth hour, it's Overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:25.492 --> 03:08:29.073]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi, I'm going to be your host for the next hour.
[03:08:29.073 --> 03:08:30.633]  And man, we're going to have a lot of fun.
[03:08:30.633 --> 03:08:37.195]  There's a lot of news, but it's time to turn on the blasters for 2016.
[03:08:37.195 --> 03:08:42.897]  We're getting a feel for it, you know, scoping it out, but it's time to blast right into it.
[03:08:42.897 --> 03:08:48.059]  And what I want for 2016, and what I think you want for 2016, is to make reality viral.
[03:08:49.588 --> 03:09:02.513]  Forget Kim Kardashian's huge behind, right, that holds champagne glasses on it, and the latest celebrity gossip about who Brad Pitt is dating, or doing whatever he's doing, or Ashton Kutcher.
[03:09:02.513 --> 03:09:06.534]  Let's make reality the number one focus of 2016.
[03:09:06.534 --> 03:09:08.755]  Because I think it already is, secretly.
[03:09:08.755 --> 03:09:13.237]  I think reality already is viral, and I think reality is what everyone wants.
[03:09:14.380 --> 03:09:18.183]  But it's like if you went to a restaurant, go to a five-star restaurant, right?
[03:09:18.183 --> 03:09:23.148]  The most amazing steakhouse, you walk in the door and someone goes, sir, sir, let me bring you right to your table.
[03:09:23.148 --> 03:09:25.250]  You sit down, the glasses are laid down.
[03:09:25.250 --> 03:09:26.791]  What would you like to eat?
[03:09:26.791 --> 03:09:29.573]  And you say, well, you know, I've read about this restaurant.
[03:09:29.573 --> 03:09:30.714]  I want to try your filet.
[03:09:30.714 --> 03:09:32.636]  I heard it's the best in the world.
[03:09:32.636 --> 03:09:35.278]  You have a Michelin star specifically because of this filet.
[03:09:35.278 --> 03:09:37.220]  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
[03:09:37.220 --> 03:09:41.043]  And they bring out a tray of McDonald's with maggots all over it.
[03:09:41.764 --> 03:09:45.147]  That's kind of what the mainstream media does to us.
[03:09:45.147 --> 03:09:46.128]  We want truth.
[03:09:46.128 --> 03:09:47.088]  We want reality.
[03:09:47.088 --> 03:09:48.049]  We want real news.
[03:09:48.049 --> 03:09:51.332]  We want just crunchy realness.
[03:09:51.332 --> 03:09:55.555]  But they bring out a tray of maggots and McDonald's.
[03:09:55.555 --> 03:09:58.157]  We say, well, you know, I'm really hungry.
[03:09:58.157 --> 03:10:00.659]  Some people say, I guess I'll just eat it.
[03:10:00.659 --> 03:10:03.702]  I guess I'll just shove the maggots in my mouth and make the best of it.
[03:10:04.872 --> 03:10:07.815]  Well, I don't think we have to do that anymore, and I'm done with it.
[03:10:07.815 --> 03:10:09.237]  And I'm not going to eat the maggots.
[03:10:09.237 --> 03:10:11.760]  I want the juicy, juicy filet of reality!
[03:10:11.760 --> 03:10:18.267]  I want the juicy, juicy filet from the five-star restaurant of truth and reality that does have a Michelin star.
[03:10:20.203 --> 03:10:21.304]  I am barging in.
[03:10:21.304 --> 03:10:21.884]  Barge in.
[03:10:21.884 --> 03:10:23.045]  Because I was just in there.
[03:10:23.045 --> 03:10:23.685]  Happy birthday.
[03:10:23.685 --> 03:10:24.105]  Thank you.
[03:10:24.105 --> 03:10:25.046]  Ten years old now.
[03:10:25.046 --> 03:10:25.887]  Ten years.
[03:10:25.887 --> 03:10:27.828]  He got a tricycle today.
[03:10:27.828 --> 03:10:28.428]  That's true.
[03:10:28.428 --> 03:10:29.529]  No, seriously.
[03:10:29.529 --> 03:10:33.952]  McBrain just made the most badass intro promo for InfoWars ever.
[03:10:33.952 --> 03:10:35.833]  They're going to ship it over here from his studio.
[03:10:35.833 --> 03:10:37.334]  We're going to premiere it at the bottom of the hour.
[03:10:37.334 --> 03:10:38.755]  It's only like three minutes long.
[03:10:38.755 --> 03:10:40.416]  Folks want to stay tuned for this.
[03:10:40.416 --> 03:10:41.737]  Keep it up, buddy.
[03:10:41.737 --> 03:10:42.698]  And hey, fund us.
[03:10:42.698 --> 03:10:44.679]  It's expensive running this operation.
[03:10:44.679 --> 03:10:46.560]  I keep forgetting to plug stuff.
[03:10:46.560 --> 03:10:47.501]  And I keep skipping network breaks.
[03:10:47.501 --> 03:10:48.342]  I tell them I've got to quit that.
[03:10:49.342 --> 03:10:51.924]  We should probably stop that.
[03:10:51.924 --> 03:10:53.344]  Anyways, it's coming up.
[03:10:53.344 --> 03:10:56.706]  Well, it's the last day to use Gift 15, too, to get 15% off the entire store.
[03:10:56.706 --> 03:10:59.808]  And we have the calendar with Mac in the front.
[03:10:59.808 --> 03:11:01.689]  It is actually a really well done calendar.
[03:11:01.689 --> 03:11:03.350]  It's a Colossi, super high quality.
[03:11:03.350 --> 03:11:09.853]  But it's the last day to use Gift 15 to get 15% off the entire InfoWars store, which includes InfoWars Life.
[03:11:09.853 --> 03:11:16.797]  This is ending, I guess, tonight at midnight, so make sure you use it now and actually support the operation and get the awesome products.
[03:11:17.597 --> 03:11:20.278]  For me right now, XT was always the number one bet.
[03:11:20.278 --> 03:11:22.539]  It's always been my favorite InfoWarsLife product.
[03:11:22.539 --> 03:11:23.660]  I mean, it's the flagship, right?
[03:11:23.660 --> 03:11:24.660]  It's the standard.
[03:11:24.660 --> 03:11:27.181]  It's the first product ever by InfoWarsLife.
[03:11:27.181 --> 03:11:33.644]  I remember when Alex released it, I guess about three years ago now, it was a constant battle to get it back in stock.
[03:11:34.344 --> 03:11:36.986]  Now it's pretty much still the case, but at least we have some.
[03:11:36.986 --> 03:11:39.828]  So go to InfoWarsLife.com and use GIFT15.
[03:11:39.828 --> 03:11:43.431]  And also, like he said, this calendar, which is really pretty cool.
[03:11:43.431 --> 03:11:47.454]  And what's interesting about the calendar is there's promo codes in it every month.
[03:11:47.454 --> 03:11:50.296]  So you can save, I think it's up to 25 or 30 percent.
[03:11:52.558 --> 03:11:53.540]  Every single month.
[03:11:53.540 --> 03:11:54.782]  So you're already making the money back.
[03:11:54.782 --> 03:12:03.435]  If you buy essentially one thing in the store after you get this calendar, which is $6, you're already making your money back because you're using a promo code to save up to 20 or 30 percent.
[03:12:05.856 --> 03:12:08.738]  So, go to InfoWareStore, support the operation.
[03:12:08.738 --> 03:12:12.059]  And, you know, talking about money, actually, I'll just break right into it.
[03:12:12.059 --> 03:12:18.362]  First, I want to open up the phone lines to pretty much whatever's on your mind at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:12:18.362 --> 03:12:19.023]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:12:19.023 --> 03:12:24.786]  You know, open up the phone lines for you guys.
[03:12:24.786 --> 03:12:28.108]  But one of the points I wanted to talk about, actually, was the truth about money.
[03:12:28.108 --> 03:12:32.550]  The radical truth about money that no one seems to get, that no one seems to understand.
[03:12:34.508 --> 03:12:39.735]  Except for the people that really have it, and except for the people that really know what's going on.
[03:12:40.757 --> 03:12:41.758]  You talk about money, right?
[03:12:41.758 --> 03:12:46.700]  You talk about this weird taboo subject of money that you're not allowed to talk about at the dinner table.
[03:12:46.700 --> 03:12:47.260]  It's rude!
[03:12:47.260 --> 03:12:53.684]  How dare you talk about something that really is, you know, what most people exist, unfortunately, for, right?
[03:12:53.684 --> 03:13:01.968]  They go to jobs they hate just to make that dollar so they could pay their rent so they can exist in a wooden house and just exist.
[03:13:01.968 --> 03:13:06.631]  Money is everything to some people, unfortunately, and they probably don't even want it to be that way, right?
[03:13:06.631 --> 03:13:08.412]  But here's the real truth about money.
[03:13:09.252 --> 03:13:27.489]  The truth about money is, I'm going to show you some articles on this subject too, including how a Chinese hospital was bulldozed with patients inside, and how GM wouldn't pay 90 cents to fix their cars, and instead, according to Bloomberg, allowed 125 people to die.
[03:13:27.489 --> 03:13:28.650]  So that's the bad side, right?
[03:13:28.650 --> 03:13:32.314]  But the truth about money is, we need more good people to have it.
[03:13:33.692 --> 03:13:42.455]  And I always hear people quote or misquote, they misquote the Bible and they say, well Anthony, money is the root of all evil!
[03:13:42.455 --> 03:13:44.576]  Money is the root of all evil!
[03:13:44.576 --> 03:13:46.516]  Jesus said so!
[03:13:46.516 --> 03:13:49.057]  Actually, that's not what Jesus said.
[03:13:49.057 --> 03:13:53.218]  Jesus said, love of money is the root of all evil.
[03:13:53.218 --> 03:13:54.519]  Love of money.
[03:13:54.519 --> 03:13:59.320]  Not money, because, I'll flip the argument around, right?
[03:13:59.320 --> 03:14:00.561]  Guns are the root of all evil!
[03:14:01.527 --> 03:14:03.969]  Well, the gun doesn't shoot anybody.
[03:14:03.969 --> 03:14:07.833]  The dollar doesn't shoot you, doesn't kill you, doesn't do anything.
[03:14:07.833 --> 03:14:14.840]  Sure, it's all ripped off by the Federal Reserve, but the dollar itself, what it represents, the currency system, or maybe gold.
[03:14:14.840 --> 03:14:17.123]  Would you rather me say a piece of gold?
[03:14:17.123 --> 03:14:18.264]  It is not inherently evil.
[03:14:18.264 --> 03:14:19.965]  It's what you choose to do with it.
[03:14:21.098 --> 03:14:22.220]  It is a tool.
[03:14:22.220 --> 03:14:24.323]  It is a fuel source.
[03:14:24.323 --> 03:14:29.751]  So you're either fueling up an operation that is helping people, right?
[03:14:29.751 --> 03:14:32.975]  Or you're fueling up something that is destroying and hurting.
[03:14:34.076 --> 03:14:39.800]  And my whole philosophy is I don't support corporations that harm people with the money that I give them.
[03:14:39.800 --> 03:14:50.669]  So if I'm going to go out and buy something, I don't want to buy something made in a Chinese slave factory where they're trying to jump out of the buildings and kill themselves because they don't want to work anymore for a penny a week, or free, or whatever.
[03:14:50.669 --> 03:14:52.450]  I don't want to support that.
[03:14:52.450 --> 03:14:57.974]  But do I vote with my dollar and buy awesome products that support operations that I enjoy?
[03:14:59.108 --> 03:15:00.829]  Or support non-profits?
[03:15:00.829 --> 03:15:02.169]  Of course!
[03:15:02.169 --> 03:15:05.831]  So the truth is, we need more good people to have money.
[03:15:05.831 --> 03:15:09.252]  I want you to make as much money as you possibly can and do good things with it.
[03:15:09.252 --> 03:15:12.434]  I want corporations and companies that are good to make tons of money.
[03:15:12.434 --> 03:15:13.774]  I'm an entrepreneur.
[03:15:13.774 --> 03:15:17.976]  I like to generate financial success for good people and good companies and myself.
[03:15:19.710 --> 03:15:20.730]  Is there anything wrong with that?
[03:15:20.730 --> 03:15:21.991]  Absolutely not.
[03:15:21.991 --> 03:15:33.936]  It enables me to give thousands of meals to food groups and non-profits just as it enables Alex, when you purchase at theinfowarsstore.com, to reach more people and do awesome things.
[03:15:33.936 --> 03:15:36.377]  And let's go into the negative side though, right?
[03:15:36.377 --> 03:15:41.659]  Because people always attach, how dare you sell things, how dare you have anything to do with money!
[03:15:42.694 --> 03:15:46.156]  And it's because of these bad apples, like this story today from Bloomberg.
[03:15:46.156 --> 03:15:50.898]  GM ignition nightmare won't go away for victims or company.
[03:15:50.898 --> 03:16:01.603]  GM, according to Bloomberg, knowingly rejected an ignition fix that would have cost 90 cents per unit, leading to at least 125 deaths.
[03:16:01.603 --> 03:16:06.485]  It says the automaker faces first trial out of hundreds of claims.
[03:16:06.485 --> 03:16:09.247]  The plaintiffs want billions of dollars for deaths and injuries.
[03:16:10.523 --> 03:16:10.923]  He goes on...
[03:16:27.108 --> 03:16:32.814]  James Yingling III couldn't break or steer his Saturn Ion away from a culvert in Pennsylvania.
[03:16:32.814 --> 03:16:35.676]  He lingered for 17 days before dying at 35.
[03:16:35.676 --> 03:16:47.127]  These are among the claims facing General Motors Company this year, the first of hundreds demanding the GM pay for the deaths of loved ones or injuries ranging from broken bones to paralysis.
[03:16:47.127 --> 03:16:50.431]  The raft of trials scattered across the country begins Monday in federal court.
[03:16:51.601 --> 03:17:08.497]  This is an example that I've talked to you about before, where a company says, apparently, according to this Bloomberg article, that's what GM is doing, but a company says, hey, we could spend 10 cents to either improve the quality of our food
[03:17:09.378 --> 03:17:14.681]  Because we know it's linked to, you know, causing cancer, killing people, or birth defects, or whatever.
[03:17:14.681 --> 03:17:20.324]  Or we could pay 90 cents, according to Bloomberg, to fix these ignition issues.
[03:17:20.324 --> 03:17:21.364]  But you know what?
[03:17:21.364 --> 03:17:24.806]  That's 90 cents per unit that we just don't want to pay.
[03:17:24.806 --> 03:17:27.507]  And unfortunately, this is the decision they make.
[03:17:27.507 --> 03:17:34.071]  They have meetings about this, and they'll say, well, we could pay 90 cents per unit, and that would cost X amount.
[03:17:34.071 --> 03:17:35.912]  Let's say that would cost, you know, $20 million.
[03:17:37.125 --> 03:17:45.476]  But we talked to our legal team, and if a few people die, it'll only cost $10 million to settle it.
[03:17:45.476 --> 03:17:47.639]  It'll only cost $10 million to settle it.
[03:17:47.639 --> 03:17:50.143]  So why don't we just go ahead and let those people die?
[03:17:51.451 --> 03:17:52.732]  And we'll settle it out of court.
[03:17:52.732 --> 03:17:54.713]  I'm not saying that's what GM did.
[03:17:54.713 --> 03:17:57.015]  I'm saying there's been cases like this.
[03:17:57.015 --> 03:18:06.201]  And just in the food example, well hey, we know that some of this, you know, could be causing cancer, could be causing birth defects, could be kind of killing people, right?
[03:18:06.201 --> 03:18:06.442]  But hey.
[03:18:07.342 --> 03:18:10.063]  It's $0.10 per burger.
[03:18:10.063 --> 03:18:12.265]  It's $0.10 per fries.
[03:18:12.265 --> 03:18:14.085]  That's too much money, guys!
[03:18:14.085 --> 03:18:15.426]  We can't pay that $0.10.
[03:18:15.426 --> 03:18:17.147]  Let's just settle out of court.
[03:18:17.147 --> 03:18:22.430]  And this is where you get that love of money as opposed to the money itself being evil.
[03:18:22.430 --> 03:18:34.316]  Because when you're so satisfied with not caring, when you've gotten rid of your empathy and you're just, I'm a starched businessman, where you can't pay $0.90 to fix something and 125 people die, that's lunacy.
[03:18:37.762 --> 03:18:40.068]  That is complete lunacy.
[03:18:40.068 --> 03:18:42.534]  And how about this one?
[03:18:42.534 --> 03:18:46.784]  China hospital bulldozed with patients inside and morgue buried.
[03:18:48.066 --> 03:18:59.155]  Bulldozers unexpectedly demolished part of a hospital and its adjoining morgue in central China, sending doctors, nurses and patients fleeing and burying under rubble six bodies being processed at the morgue.
[03:18:59.155 --> 03:19:05.880]  And this is a whole new crazy China government system, but it just also goes to show some of the madness.
[03:19:05.880 --> 03:19:07.281]  And then this one.
[03:19:07.281 --> 03:19:09.863]  Turkish firm caught selling fake life vests.
[03:19:09.863 --> 03:19:12.225]  They soak up water for refugees at sea.
[03:19:12.225 --> 03:19:13.486]  They soak up water.
[03:19:14.773 --> 03:19:16.954]  This is again prophets before people stuff.
[03:19:16.954 --> 03:19:27.697]  In the chilly rough waters of Aegon, if I'm saying that right, tricky under the best of circumstances and downright treacherous in a flimsy migrant boat, a life vest can make the difference between life and death.
[03:19:27.697 --> 03:19:34.660]  But for the unlucky refugees who would have bought roughly 1,200 life vests being manufactured in Turkey, that was a false promise.
[03:19:34.660 --> 03:19:36.400]  They sold them life vests.
[03:19:36.400 --> 03:19:37.921]  This is so horrible.
[03:19:37.921 --> 03:19:40.141]  They soak up water and let them die.
[03:19:40.141 --> 03:19:41.382]  But hey, make it a buck.
[03:19:42.102 --> 03:19:44.403]  Can't spend ten cents to make it real, I'm sure.
[03:19:44.403 --> 03:19:45.323]  This is Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:19:45.323 --> 03:19:47.923]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show Overdrive.
[03:19:47.923 --> 03:19:52.685]  We'll be right back with a lot more news and the intro Alex was talking about will play later on the show as well.
[03:19:52.685 --> 03:19:59.086]  Stay tuned.
[03:19:59.086 --> 03:20:02.687]  Winter has just begun and are you already tired of being cold?
[03:20:02.687 --> 03:20:05.047]  How would you like to never be cold again?
[03:20:05.047 --> 03:20:11.169]  This is Dale with Fortress Clothing and I'm here to tell you, you will never be cold again with Fortress.
[03:20:11.914 --> 03:20:21.800]  If you're tired of freezing your butt off, elk hunting, sitting in a tree stand deer hunting, winter camping, fishing, ice fishing, no longer fear the cold.
[03:20:21.800 --> 03:20:25.823]  If you snowmobile, ski, snowboard, get Fortress.
[03:20:25.823 --> 03:20:32.447]  Sledding with the kids, shoveling the walks, shopping, or if you or your spouse get cold feet at home, get Fortress.
[03:20:32.447 --> 03:20:40.832]  If you're stuck outside working in the cold, or find yourself in an emergency situation, get our winter bug out bag, and you will never be cold again.
[03:20:41.332 --> 03:20:45.496]  Fortress is the answer, so quit complaining and go to FortressClothing.com.

[03:20:59.076 --> 03:21:05.780]  Chronic inflammation is now known to block your ability to repair and compromises your immune system, making you more vulnerable to all diseases.
[03:21:05.780 --> 03:21:10.963]  Since poor diet, injuries or stress are all contributing factors, many people suffer from inflammation.
[03:21:10.963 --> 03:21:16.086]  Your body's number one means of neutralizing inflammation and the pain that it may be causing is glutathione.
[03:21:16.086 --> 03:21:20.429]  Glutathione is the body's number one peptide to neutralize free radicals and thus stop inflammation.
[03:21:20.649 --> 03:21:21.870]  Hi, my name is Jason.
[03:21:21.870 --> 03:21:22.991]  I'm 44 years old.
[03:21:22.991 --> 03:21:29.378]  For 10 years, I have been suffering from chronic pain in my abdomen and groin that radiated down into my feet.
[03:21:29.378 --> 03:21:36.706]  After three weeks on One World Way, the pain in my feet reduced by 50% and the overall pain in my body reduced significantly as well.
[03:21:36.706 --> 03:21:37.747]  I ran out of One World Way
[03:21:38.007 --> 03:21:39.248]  And the pain returned.
[03:21:39.248 --> 03:21:45.054]  I got another container, and again, after three weeks, the pain reduced significantly throughout my body.
[03:21:45.054 --> 03:21:49.718]  I'd highly recommend One World Way to anyone dealing with chronic pain due to inflammation.
[03:21:49.718 --> 03:21:50.920]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[03:21:50.920 --> 03:21:51.881]  That's One World, W-H-E-Y.com.
[03:21:58.095 --> 03:22:02.938]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, a crashing economy.
[03:22:02.938 --> 03:22:04.039]  Are you ready?
[03:22:04.039 --> 03:22:06.820]  At best, your local stores have a three-day supply of food.
[03:22:06.820 --> 03:22:09.162]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?
[03:22:09.162 --> 03:22:12.944]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety that it'll never happen to you?
[03:22:12.944 --> 03:22:18.027]  Be wise and be ready with 25-Year Shelf Life Wise Food Storage.

[03:24:00.023 --> 03:24:05.849]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:05.849 --> 03:24:08.152]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:24:13.885 --> 03:24:26.817]  According to the hypocrisy playing out in the well-connected avenues of Hollywood, there are people that were the people that did this to both me and Cory that are still working, they're still out there, and they're some of the richest, most powerful people in this business.
[03:24:26.817 --> 03:24:33.643]  And the grease palms inhabiting the shady back rooms of Washington, D.C., being a serial rapist isn't a crime.
[03:24:33.643 --> 03:24:37.667]  Not if your first name is Bill, and not if it ends with Cosby or Clinton.
[03:24:37.947 --> 03:24:42.573]  Of course, for the average serial rapist, take one Daniel Hoytsclaw, for instance.
[03:24:42.573 --> 03:24:55.210]  Hoytsclaw faces 263 years behind bars, as he should, for 18 counts of raping women ranging in the ages of 17 to 57, while serving as an Oklahoma police officer.
[03:24:55.490 --> 03:25:02.136]  Is there any difference in the allegations attached to Cosby and Clinton beyond the statute of limitations?
[03:25:02.136 --> 03:25:13.426]  Hoyt's Claw used the plight of black females' overwhelming fear that reporting rape guarantees negative results, especially since it was a police officer that committed the rape in the first place.
[03:25:13.426 --> 03:25:20.753]  Bill Cosby, a married man, allegedly lured his victims in with his celebrity and then drugged and raped them while they were passed out.
[03:25:20.953 --> 03:25:21.474]  We're good to go.
[03:25:38.410 --> 03:25:51.280]  Bill Clinton, who continues to dodge allegations of the rape of Juanita Broderick and the sexual assaults of many others, carries on proudly stumping for his wife to be the all-powerful Saul Alinskyite-in-Chief.
[03:25:51.280 --> 03:25:59.647]  Hillary Clinton, a woman whose vague, illegitimate claim to being presidential material is her nefarious fumbling of Benghazi Egypt and Libya.
[03:25:59.967 --> 03:26:02.210]  You are very rude, and I will never call on you.
[03:26:22.759 --> 03:26:43.426]  And whether you agree or disagree on what may be dubious charges for the two bills, can we not agree on the fact that a mushrooming plague of rape is being largely ignored as rape in the military expands and the media coverage of the rape of American children by illegal aliens at unprecedented levels continues to be neglected?
[03:26:43.826 --> 03:26:57.455]  Meanwhile, Obama and company import the invasion of rape culture currently unleashing its will in Europe into America, while attempting to steal your Second Amendment protections from the incoming onslaught.
[03:26:57.455 --> 03:27:04.800]  Regardless of the blatant disrespect towards rape victims shown by our supposed upright leaders, know this, rapists.
[03:27:05.120 --> 03:27:08.202]  You have started something we aim to finish.
[03:27:08.202 --> 03:27:15.468]  You see, there are more than enough Americans that aren't as timid as the left may have led you to believe.
[03:27:15.468 --> 03:27:16.969]  There is a good side to the mob.
[03:27:16.969 --> 03:27:19.711]  You got the good, the bad, and the ugly, like everything else.
[03:27:20.359 --> 03:27:22.800]  In politics, you have that too.
[03:27:22.800 --> 03:27:24.140]  All the time have.
[03:27:24.140 --> 03:27:29.862]  You have, you know, the rise of Hitler, who was in government, and you know, then everybody else follows, you know, in Europe.
[03:27:29.862 --> 03:27:35.763]  They got no other ways but, you know, to take that side, you know what I'm saying, because they don't want to get killed and this and that.
[03:27:35.763 --> 03:27:42.685]  But then you got the good side, America, that rises up and connects and allies with the mob.
[03:27:42.685 --> 03:27:44.306]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[03:27:45.734 --> 03:27:49.757]  Well, there's a report by John Bowne, and you know, it kind of reminds me of something.
[03:27:49.757 --> 03:28:02.785]  The way that the federal government handles things is to ignore all of the real stuff that they need to tell you, and all this real stuff that needs to be going on, and tell you some of the most silly possible answers, so-called answers.
[03:28:02.785 --> 03:28:04.226]  And check out this article.
[03:28:04.226 --> 03:28:06.908]  Feds to businesses for their health strategy on what to do.
[03:28:07.848 --> 03:28:09.991]  Start doing walking meetings.
[03:28:09.991 --> 03:28:23.288]  The federal government issued its final version of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines, which stresses a collective approach to eating and lectures businesses to add physical activity into their employees' workdays by leading walking meetings.
[03:28:24.329 --> 03:28:24.930]  Wow!
[03:28:24.930 --> 03:28:29.274]  The long-awaited guidelines ultimately made no mention of sustainability.
[03:28:29.274 --> 03:28:32.658]  They also made no mention of really anything that matters.
[03:28:32.658 --> 03:28:39.646]  They said, avoid calories from added sugars and saturated fats, reduce sodium intake, and to avoid whole milk.
[03:28:40.973 --> 03:28:44.937]  And it goes on to say, all food and beverage choices matter.
[03:28:44.937 --> 03:28:51.744]  They took a collective approach to food and health, and they say, you know, you guys, everyone has a role in supporting healthy eating patterns.
[03:28:51.744 --> 03:28:53.826]  You guys need to have walking meetings.
[03:28:53.826 --> 03:28:56.188]  They don't tell you about any of the real stuff.
[03:28:56.188 --> 03:28:56.789]  They don't tell you about
[03:28:56.869 --> 03:28:58.170]  They don't tell you about any of the food additives.
[03:28:58.170 --> 03:29:03.734]  They don't tell you about any of the toxic stuff that is in pretty much every single processed food out there.
[03:29:03.734 --> 03:29:12.099]  They don't even talk about the Washington Post in 2007, how a third of all processed food contains mercury levels that are super unsafe.
[03:29:12.099 --> 03:29:12.619]  Mercury!
[03:29:12.619 --> 03:29:16.682]  That's not even getting into the high fructose corn syrup, which is where the mercury comes from.
[03:29:16.682 --> 03:29:23.867]  And what that does to you, or how Princeton found out that it was a lot different than sugar, even though we've been told it's not over and over again.
[03:29:23.867 --> 03:29:25.428]  We need to have walking meetings, guys.
[03:29:25.768 --> 03:29:26.388]  That's the answer.
[03:29:26.388 --> 03:29:27.249]  Forget what you're eating.
[03:29:27.249 --> 03:29:29.550]  We need to walk around while we meet.
[03:29:29.550 --> 03:29:30.471]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:29:30.471 --> 03:29:32.332]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:32.332 --> 03:29:37.495]  We're going to come back with a special intro that Alex wants you to see, and then we're going to take your calls and cover more news.
[03:29:37.495 --> 03:29:38.355]  It's all coming right up.
[03:29:38.355 --> 03:29:47.661]  Stay tuned.
[03:29:47.661 --> 03:29:49.062]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.062 --> 03:29:51.603]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.603 --> 03:29:54.285]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.678 --> 03:30:05.226]  A Missouri bill defines sex between lawmakers and lobbyists as a gift, reports NBC News.
[03:30:05.226 --> 03:30:16.540]  Lobbyists in Missouri who have sex with state lawmakers or their aides would have to disclose that activity to the State Ethics Commission under a bill introduced this week by a Republican state representative.
[03:30:16.920 --> 03:30:28.262]  The measure, pushed by Representative Bart Corman, defines sexual relations between lawmakers and lobbyists as a gift to be reported on the disclosure forms that lobbyists file on a monthly basis.
[03:30:28.262 --> 03:30:32.023]  The bill does not assign a dollar valuation to the gift of sex.
[03:30:32.023 --> 03:30:38.324]  Corman's proposal, reported early Thursday by the Kansas City Star, quickly gained attention on social media.
[03:30:38.324 --> 03:30:46.486]  And Corman told USA Today that he was fielding calls from reporters all across the country, demanding to know more about his unorthodox proposal.
[03:30:46.946 --> 03:30:50.615]  I guess this has gone viral or something, he was quoted as saying.
[03:30:50.615 --> 03:30:54.463]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[03:30:58.439 --> 03:31:04.663]  Our bloated federal government and a coterie of megacorporations are hoping that we all have the memory of a goldfish.
[03:31:04.663 --> 03:31:07.844]  We forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[03:31:07.844 --> 03:31:17.010]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[03:31:17.010 --> 03:31:20.492]  Instead, use your gift cards to help support the info war and get 15%
[03:31:21.032 --> 03:31:21.452]  We're good to go.
[03:31:47.503 --> 03:31:47.743]  I think so.
[03:32:08.382 --> 03:32:12.104]  Like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, plant-derived minerals, and much more.

[03:33:16.001 --> 03:33:16.662]  Criminals!
[03:33:16.662 --> 03:33:17.222]  Gangsters!
[03:33:17.222 --> 03:33:20.126]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose.
[03:33:22.523 --> 03:33:26.045]  We have a fog that has descended upon our entire nation.
[03:33:26.045 --> 03:33:28.246]  The globalists are going to blow stuff up and blame it on you.
[03:33:28.246 --> 03:33:30.488]  But Hillary's the one who runs the cover-up.
[03:33:30.488 --> 03:33:36.251]  Everything you've heard us talk about is now going to unfold in triplicate spades.
[03:33:36.251 --> 03:33:37.412]  It's as real as it gets.
[03:33:37.412 --> 03:33:41.094]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[03:33:41.094 --> 03:33:42.375]  To Matt, it's over for you.
[03:33:42.375 --> 03:33:44.836]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[03:33:44.836 --> 03:33:46.137]  You're out of there.
[03:33:46.137 --> 03:33:47.678]  You want it, baby?
[03:33:47.678 --> 03:33:49.239]  You're about to get it.
[03:33:55.925 --> 03:34:04.348]  We did meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea, be tolerant, and see how many guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
[03:34:04.348 --> 03:34:09.270]  We met them at Concord Bridge, and we blew their punk-ass brains out.
[03:34:09.270 --> 03:34:21.274]  InfoWars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation, blow the criminal cover of operatives more than any other institution out there of freedom, and I'm so proud of that.
[03:34:21.454 --> 03:34:24.776]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women.
[03:34:24.776 --> 03:34:29.839]  No, Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[03:34:29.839 --> 03:34:39.864]  I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us, when you censor us, when you attack us, when you delist us, when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.
[03:34:39.864 --> 03:34:42.706]  These people are of the devil.
[03:34:42.706 --> 03:34:44.026]  Let's be very blunt about this.
[03:34:45.487 --> 03:34:47.949]  Tell and demand accountability.
[03:34:47.949 --> 03:34:52.153]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[03:34:55.620 --> 03:35:01.503]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:35:01.503 --> 03:35:03.764]  The crowd is now moving forward toward the barrier.
[03:35:03.764 --> 03:35:05.504]  That was a powerful intro.
[03:35:05.504 --> 03:35:08.486]  They're going to shoot if we don't move back.
[03:35:08.486 --> 03:35:12.688]  Their defeat will be ultimately... Now we're going to take some calls.
[03:35:12.688 --> 03:35:14.028]  That was actually a really powerful intro.
[03:35:14.028 --> 03:35:16.609]  I'm glad Alex stopped in and mentioned that he wanted to play that.
[03:35:16.609 --> 03:35:20.831]  We're going to go ahead and talk to Paris in Delaware.
[03:35:20.831 --> 03:35:23.773]  He says he's a high school teacher and wants to talk on all issues.
[03:35:23.773 --> 03:35:24.413]  What's up, Paris?
[03:35:26.366 --> 03:35:32.152]  I teach high school health, actually, and I wanted you to know I thank you guys so much for what you do.
[03:35:32.152 --> 03:35:43.103]  I share a lot of your articles and videos that you have on your website with my students in class, and we've had such an impact that I actually had doctors call the school to complain because so many of my students
[03:35:43.635 --> 03:35:51.218]  We're refusing the Gardasil and flu shots, and it inspired an investigation by my school district into what I was doing.
[03:35:51.218 --> 03:35:57.320]  And I want you to know that I've weathered that, and so we really are having an impact on these kids and their parents as well.
[03:35:57.320 --> 03:35:59.340]  I speak at the school board meetings as well.
[03:35:59.340 --> 03:36:06.623]  The newspapers have started covering it, and it's just been a wild ride, and it's all thanks to you guys.
[03:36:06.623 --> 03:36:10.124]  And there's a lot of me, you know, out there, people doing these things, you know.
[03:36:10.544 --> 03:36:31.025]  Humanity is rising up to meet this challenge and I got to tell you it's just been a lot of fun and I've actually been influenced some of my pharmaceutical rep friends you know they're you know just pulling people out of the matrix as much as possible and I just want to thank you guys so much for what for when you guys pulled me out of the matrix several years ago.
[03:36:31.650 --> 03:36:40.312]  Well, the real people making a difference are people like you that are teaching children, you know, think for themselves and actually helping them in many ways.
[03:36:40.312 --> 03:36:46.033]  I think with the whole medical system and really anything, there's nothing wrong with questioning, right?
[03:36:46.033 --> 03:36:48.974]  There's nothing wrong with presenting alternative information.
[03:36:48.974 --> 03:36:53.695]  What is scary is when people freak out and try to stop you from presenting the alternative view.
[03:36:54.375 --> 03:36:54.695]  Right?
[03:36:54.695 --> 03:36:59.399]  So it's fine, and the medical system has, you know, if you're in a car accident, you need surgery.
[03:36:59.399 --> 03:37:03.163]  You're not going to take herbs and recover.
[03:37:03.163 --> 03:37:08.187]  If your arm is, you know, cut off and you're bleeding everywhere, you have to go to a hospital and get surgery.
[03:37:08.187 --> 03:37:10.489]  The medical system has many benefits.
[03:37:10.489 --> 03:37:12.771]  You know, the establishment system, right?
[03:37:12.771 --> 03:37:19.396]  It's just where they start turning it into the overlord system, where they are everything, and there's no such thing as prevention.
[03:37:20.270 --> 03:37:29.398]  But thankfully, you know, you being an example as well, I also know several MDs that own major health institutions that are 100% saying, hey, wait a minute.
[03:37:29.398 --> 03:37:36.524]  Maybe, number one, we shouldn't be charging $100 for a bag of saline that costs less than one cent, right?
[03:37:36.524 --> 03:37:38.106]  Maybe we shouldn't be doing that.
[03:37:38.106 --> 03:37:42.369]  Maybe we shouldn't be over-prescribing drugs to all these people when they don't need them.
[03:37:42.369 --> 03:37:44.871]  And maybe we should look at prevention
[03:37:45.732 --> 03:38:00.612]  Instead of just giving everyone surgery and prescribing pharmaceutical drugs with known side effects, when the pharmaceutical companies are willing to settle lawsuits, kind of like we talked about earlier, instead of actually upgrade and fix their product, right?
[03:38:00.612 --> 03:38:02.134]  So, it doesn't even matter
[03:38:03.120 --> 03:38:06.423]  What you choose to do, as long as you present the alternative information.
[03:38:06.423 --> 03:38:08.444]  As long as you say, hey, there's at least an option.
[03:38:08.444 --> 03:38:10.086]  If you want to vaccinate, that's fine.
[03:38:10.086 --> 03:38:12.648]  But here's some of the information that you might want to look at.
[03:38:12.648 --> 03:38:12.788]  Right?
[03:38:12.788 --> 03:38:13.569]  That's my view.
[03:38:13.569 --> 03:38:16.051]  And when you can't do that, that's when there's a huge issue.
[03:38:16.051 --> 03:38:21.956]  When they won't even let you present an alternative viewpoint, that is when it's really, really scary.
[03:38:21.956 --> 03:38:26.459]  Let's go to Christopher in California.
[03:38:26.459 --> 03:38:31.644]  What's on your mind?
[03:38:31.644 --> 03:38:32.084]  Chris, you there?
[03:38:33.732 --> 03:38:35.573]  Alright, well we'll have to jump to the next caller.
[03:38:35.573 --> 03:38:37.635]  Let's go to Robert in California.
[03:38:37.635 --> 03:38:40.437]  What's on your mind, Robert?
[03:38:40.437 --> 03:38:41.718]  Hey, Anthony.
[03:38:41.718 --> 03:38:43.679]  Happy New Year.
[03:38:43.679 --> 03:38:44.860]  Happy birthday, too.
[03:38:44.860 --> 03:38:45.560]  Is that right?
[03:38:45.560 --> 03:38:46.901]  Yes, thank you very much.
[03:38:46.901 --> 03:38:49.283]  Appreciate it.
[03:38:49.283 --> 03:38:51.685]  Isn't it Big's birthday yesterday or something like that?
[03:38:51.685 --> 03:38:55.307]  It's actually his birthday today, and it's Elvis' birthday and David Bowie.
[03:38:55.307 --> 03:38:58.950]  A lot of interesting characters today.
[03:38:58.950 --> 03:39:02.552]  Yeah, my birthday is the 20th.
[03:39:02.552 --> 03:39:03.153]  George Burns.
[03:39:03.809 --> 03:39:05.550]  Oh, very interesting.
[03:39:05.550 --> 03:39:07.890]  Well, what's on your mind, Robert?
[03:39:07.890 --> 03:39:23.435]  Well, you know, I was listening to you guys on the show, and I was watching President Obama's little speech, and one of the things that just really irked me was that he was saying, and let me get over to my Twitter account real quick.
[03:39:23.435 --> 03:39:28.017]  He said that he believes in the Second Amendment, then he turns around and says,
[03:39:28.732 --> 03:39:32.136]  It's on the paper, and it's the way he says it.
[03:39:32.136 --> 03:39:35.119]  It's on the paper.
[03:39:35.119 --> 03:39:37.582]  And it's like, well, wait a minute.
[03:39:37.582 --> 03:39:39.043]  He's talking about the Bill of Rights.
[03:39:39.043 --> 03:39:39.924]  It's on the paper.
[03:39:39.924 --> 03:39:45.671]  This is a president talking about our Bill of Rights being a piece of paper.
[03:39:45.671 --> 03:39:48.714]  So that kind of really made me totally livid.
[03:39:49.113 --> 03:40:02.322]  Just seeing that and the way that he said it, it's totally disrespectful to the Bill of Rights, totally disrespectful to the Constitution, but given the fact of what I've seen so far on today's show, it's no wonder.
[03:40:02.322 --> 03:40:11.549]  But, you know, how do you wake up these people to see, you know, get them to see that, hey, this guy is nothing more than a Trojan horse?
[03:40:12.096 --> 03:40:13.878]  You know, I'll share my story.
[03:40:13.878 --> 03:40:22.988]  If anyone in the world would probably be a tough candidate to see the truth about, you know, the Second Amendment and guns and everything, it would have been me, right?
[03:40:22.988 --> 03:40:29.415]  I'm growing up on the East Coast, in Philadelphia, in the city, where no one has a gun.
[03:40:29.415 --> 03:40:31.817]  If you even talk about guns, how, oh my, a gun?
[03:40:31.817 --> 03:40:32.037]  What?
[03:40:32.037 --> 03:40:32.798]  You know, you're crazy!
[03:40:33.701 --> 03:40:41.767]  And everyone on television is talking about gun crime and only the most terrible people and gangs are having guns in these drive-by shootings.
[03:40:41.767 --> 03:40:42.908]  Guns are scary, man.
[03:40:42.908 --> 03:40:44.489]  Why would you ever want one of those, right?
[03:40:44.489 --> 03:40:47.291]  The whole East Coast, downtown mentality.
[03:40:47.291 --> 03:40:52.315]  You have to get a permit, like you have to be carrying cash if you're even going to have a pistol, and even then it's hard to get one.
[03:40:53.656 --> 03:40:58.781]  I was 100% convinced, you know, when I was much younger, that guns were horrible.
[03:40:58.781 --> 03:41:00.242]  I mean, why have them?
[03:41:00.242 --> 03:41:01.924]  We should just get rid of them.
[03:41:01.924 --> 03:41:02.284]  Right?
[03:41:02.284 --> 03:41:05.347]  Of course, this was when I was a kid and just watching the news and stuff.
[03:41:05.347 --> 03:41:06.588]  No one told me.
[03:41:06.588 --> 03:41:12.313]  But then, when I did my own research into it, I made a two-hour video about this, actually.
[03:41:12.313 --> 03:41:14.335]  This is part of what I was talking about earlier.
[03:41:14.335 --> 03:41:15.957]  You're not allowed to talk about this stuff, though.
[03:41:17.059 --> 03:41:19.000]  Because here's the most amazing thing.
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:20.820]  I'm not even telling you what to think.
[03:41:20.820 --> 03:41:23.021]  I'm just going to talk about some statistics.
[03:41:23.021 --> 03:41:32.984]  The FBI crime statistics that Obama does not want to talk about, nobody does, where you look at how many people are actually killed by rifles, and then you look at how many are killed by handguns, and then you look at that.
[03:41:32.984 --> 03:41:35.525]  Say, well, how many of those were self-defense?
[03:41:35.525 --> 03:41:38.246]  Wow, that's a shockingly large number, right?
[03:41:38.246 --> 03:41:40.447]  The rifle deaths especially are super, super low.
[03:41:41.127 --> 03:41:49.591]  No one actually is going out and killing with a rifle in most cases, unless it's in self-defense, you know, at their house or something.
[03:41:49.591 --> 03:41:51.612]  People don't use rifles to go out and kill people.
[03:41:51.612 --> 03:42:02.517]  Then you say, well, of all of these, how many deaths were estimated to be prevented, though, from the use of a gun, either shooting or not even shooting it, just having it out?
[03:42:03.197 --> 03:42:03.858]  Then it's like 800,000.
[03:42:03.858 --> 03:42:07.903]  You say, wow, these are really interesting statistics.
[03:42:07.903 --> 03:42:13.269]  And then even talking to some of my most quote-unquote liberal friends, they're like, yeah, I own a gun.
[03:42:13.269 --> 03:42:18.175]  You know, I have a couple pistols in the house and a rifle or whatever, and I think it's a great idea.
[03:42:19.394 --> 03:42:23.799]  And I say, where is this mantra of banning all guns coming from?
[03:42:23.799 --> 03:42:25.281]  Oh wait, it's coming from nowhere.
[03:42:25.281 --> 03:42:32.270]  It's the mainstream media once again controlling the narrative, acting like we all agree, acting like, come on, what are you, a redneck?
[03:42:32.270 --> 03:42:33.892]  What are you, some type of redneck?
[03:42:33.892 --> 03:42:35.433]  We need to just ban them all, man.
[03:42:35.433 --> 03:42:36.154]  Just ban them all.
[03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:40.743]  So, the answer to your question, I'd say, you're asking how to wake people up.
[03:42:40.743 --> 03:42:42.844]  I think most of them already get it.
[03:42:42.844 --> 03:42:51.890]  But, just look at me, you know, I'm some city slicker, you know, fool from downtown Philadelphia that somehow figured it out because I looked at the information.
[03:42:51.890 --> 03:42:53.772]  Show them the FBI statistics.
[03:42:53.772 --> 03:42:55.793]  And don't tell people what to think.
[03:42:55.793 --> 03:42:57.374]  Don't say, well, they're good because blah blah blah.
[03:42:57.374 --> 03:42:58.875]  Say, hey, look at the numbers.
[03:42:58.875 --> 03:42:59.936]  Look at the numbers.
[03:42:59.936 --> 03:43:00.717]  Because you notice
[03:43:01.727 --> 03:43:05.013]  No one in the mainstream, Obama, they don't want to talk about the actual numbers.
[03:43:05.013 --> 03:43:07.618]  I think that pretty much proves the point to most people.
[03:43:07.618 --> 03:43:10.082]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Wyoming.
[03:43:10.082 --> 03:43:10.683]  How's it going, Tim?
[03:43:11.926 --> 03:43:12.366]  Good.
[03:43:12.366 --> 03:43:13.047]  Good, Anthony.
[03:43:13.047 --> 03:43:14.348]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:43:14.348 --> 03:43:15.429]  I appreciate it.
[03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:16.469]  Well, thanks for calling in.
[03:43:16.469 --> 03:43:17.070]  Happy New Year.
[03:43:17.070 --> 03:43:18.111]  Appreciate it.
[03:43:18.111 --> 03:43:18.991]  Thank you.
[03:43:18.991 --> 03:43:22.053]  Well, the question I have, actually not a question, a comment.
[03:43:22.053 --> 03:43:28.178]  I wanted to talk about Bitcoin because Alex was speaking with one of his guests, whose name I can't remember.
[03:43:28.178 --> 03:43:30.039]  I think it was a Molyneux.
[03:43:30.039 --> 03:43:30.960]  No, it was somebody else.
[03:43:30.960 --> 03:43:31.841]  I can't remember who it was.
[03:43:33.103 --> 03:43:56.494]  One of his guests was speaking about Bitcoin and I was wondering how long will it be, this is one question I have, but how long will it be before InfoWars or AlexJones.com or PrisonPlanet.com or any of the free speech systems companies, Alex Jones's companies, will accept Bitcoin for payment?
[03:43:56.494 --> 03:44:01.437]  Well actually I'm pretty sure, no I'm pretty sure unless something changes that InfoWars store does accept Bitcoin actually.
[03:44:01.980 --> 03:44:04.141]  I'm pretty sure you can use BitWallet.
[03:44:04.141 --> 03:44:05.961]  Yeah, InfoWare store 99.9% sure.
[03:44:05.961 --> 03:44:08.462]  Maybe someone back there can confirm it's still happening.
[03:44:08.462 --> 03:44:10.083]  It does actually support Bitcoin.
[03:44:10.083 --> 03:44:12.984]  All of Alex's stores do, as far as I'm aware.
[03:44:12.984 --> 03:44:17.885]  So I think the, uh, I was going to say, Hey, you have to ask Alex about, but then you want further.
[03:44:17.885 --> 03:44:19.866]  I'm pretty sure we actually do accept that.
[03:44:19.866 --> 03:44:21.486]  So feel free.
[03:44:21.486 --> 03:44:22.447]  Independent currency.
[03:44:22.447 --> 03:44:23.227]  Alex is all about it.
[03:44:24.569 --> 03:44:31.395]  Great, because last time I checked, I think one single Bitcoin was something like, I think it was $400.
[03:44:31.395 --> 03:44:33.617]  $400, yeah.
[03:44:33.617 --> 03:44:34.138]  Or something.
[03:44:34.138 --> 03:44:36.540]  It used to be about $1,200.
[03:44:36.540 --> 03:44:37.361]  Right, right.
[03:44:37.361 --> 03:44:44.427]  And I think I remember one of the guests was saying something about having gone to one of the first Bitcoin
[03:44:47.401 --> 03:44:47.641]  I don't
[03:45:07.615 --> 03:45:11.638]  And they were pretty much worthless at that point, like you're saying, and people would just have them.
[03:45:11.638 --> 03:45:18.683]  And I remember someone explaining it to me, and because they didn't explain it to me too well, and I didn't really look into it, it sounded like a total, you know, load of BS.
[03:45:18.683 --> 03:45:27.089]  They were like, yeah, well, it's just these coins, and they're like digital, and you can just buy stuff with them, like you could buy, you know, like doodads and stuff.
[03:45:27.089 --> 03:45:28.850]  And I was like, well, what's it based on, you know?
[03:45:28.850 --> 03:45:30.612]  I was like, what is it based on?
[03:45:30.612 --> 03:45:31.852]  How does it have any value?
[03:45:31.852 --> 03:45:33.053]  They're like, well, it's based on nothing.
[03:45:33.053 --> 03:45:34.534]  It's just an online currency.
[03:45:34.534 --> 03:45:34.875]  I'm like, well,
[03:45:35.495 --> 03:45:37.376]  You know, how do you hold it?
[03:45:37.376 --> 03:45:38.176]  How do you do all that?
[03:45:38.176 --> 03:45:39.757]  And he goes, well you don't.
[03:45:39.757 --> 03:45:41.078]  It's just kind of like there.
[03:45:41.078 --> 03:45:43.319]  It's just a digital currency.
[03:45:43.319 --> 03:45:44.480]  Sounds like a load of crap.
[03:45:44.480 --> 03:45:45.921]  I don't want any of that.
[03:45:45.921 --> 03:45:47.802]  But then, of course, right?
[03:45:47.802 --> 03:45:51.063]  If I actually knew how it worked back then, I would understand a bit more.
[03:45:51.063 --> 03:45:53.264]  But at the time, people were just giving them away.
[03:45:53.264 --> 03:45:59.808]  They were trading like hundreds of them for video games online or donating them to other people.
[03:46:00.428 --> 03:46:03.112]  Because it was kind of just like this weird digital currency.
[03:46:03.112 --> 03:46:07.598]  And I know people that had a bunch of them back in the day, and they don't remember how to access them.
[03:46:07.598 --> 03:46:12.445]  They had hundreds of them on their account, and to this day, they don't know how to access them.
[03:46:12.445 --> 03:46:16.711]  And I know some people also that sold them when they were at like 30 bucks, and they thought they made a huge bunch of money, made like...
[03:46:17.091 --> 03:46:18.051]  You know, a few hundred dollars.
[03:46:18.051 --> 03:46:19.672]  Oh my God, I made a few hundred dollars.
[03:46:19.672 --> 03:46:20.792]  And then it goes up to $1,200.
[03:46:20.792 --> 03:46:27.935]  So yeah, Bitcoin is very interesting, but I'm pretty sure you can use bitcoins at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:46:27.935 --> 03:46:30.176]  And you can also use promo code GIFT15.
[03:46:30.176 --> 03:46:32.897]  This is the last day to use it.

[03:46:44.741 --> 03:46:46.842]  You're going to forget about it if you don't do it now.
[03:46:46.842 --> 03:46:48.383]  You're going to wake up Monday, it's going to be gone.
[03:46:48.383 --> 03:46:50.743]  15% off the entire store.

[03:46:51.844 --> 03:46:53.565]  It's 2016.
[03:46:53.565 --> 03:46:54.245]  Take the products.
[03:46:54.245 --> 03:46:56.486]  I take them every single day in my protein shake.
[03:46:56.486 --> 03:47:01.128]  The best way to do it is you make a protein shake, and you put all of them in there.
[03:47:01.128 --> 03:47:03.189]  The serving size of each one into the protein shake.
[03:47:03.189 --> 03:47:05.449]  You mix it up, and you drink it, and you're done for the whole day.
[03:47:05.449 --> 03:47:06.670]  You don't even have to worry about it.
[03:47:06.670 --> 03:47:10.552]  You don't have to sit there and say, oh, well, I've got to take the deep cleanse now and the X2 later.
[03:47:10.552 --> 03:47:13.433]  Put it all in the protein shake, drink it down, and you're done.
[03:47:14.304 --> 03:47:19.527]  And watch how your health improves and how you feel different in about a month.

[03:47:29.674 --> 03:47:30.694]  Send some emails in.
[03:47:30.694 --> 03:47:32.295]  Let us know what you think about these products.
[03:47:32.295 --> 03:47:34.217]  They are truly life-changing.
[03:47:34.217 --> 03:47:37.659]  And I really, really stand by that, and I know Alex does as well.
[03:47:37.659 --> 03:47:40.781]  All right, we're going to go to Anthony in Florida.
[03:47:40.781 --> 03:47:41.681]  How are you doing?
[03:47:41.681 --> 03:47:42.302]  What's on your mind?
[03:47:43.499 --> 03:47:46.538]  Hello, yes, I would like to talk about the...
[03:47:47.665 --> 03:47:48.886]  What do you call it?
[03:47:48.886 --> 03:47:54.049]  The political correctness, the mental illness that is political correctness that has infiltrated the colleges.
[03:47:54.049 --> 03:47:55.830]  Right on, go ahead.
[03:47:55.830 --> 03:48:12.801]  Yeah, and I can't help to notice how this is right out of the 1960s cultural revolution in China, where basically the government just totally brainwashed the young people into basically, what do you call it, rejecting their culture and their heritage.
[03:48:14.242 --> 03:48:26.707]  I couldn't help to notice too, especially at Yale, when that one student, you know, you listen to it, it's like she was literally whining about something that is just totally irrelevant.
[03:48:26.707 --> 03:48:29.569]  And I couldn't, you know what I'm saying?
[03:48:29.569 --> 03:48:30.189]  Yeah.
[03:48:30.189 --> 03:48:33.971]  And so I just like to, I just like to elaborate a little bit about that too.
[03:48:33.971 --> 03:48:36.792]  No, political correctness is total verbal domination.
[03:48:36.792 --> 03:48:37.712]  I've said it here before.
[03:48:37.712 --> 03:48:38.793]  I've explained it to you before.
[03:48:39.853 --> 03:48:44.375]  It is 100% thought domination.
[03:48:44.375 --> 03:48:49.217]  Because if I say something, and anyone can now make anything offensive, right?
[03:48:49.217 --> 03:48:52.719]  So if I say something, wow I like your dress, oh my god!
[03:48:52.719 --> 03:48:52.919]  Right?
[03:48:52.919 --> 03:48:56.320]  You can instantly call me a sexist, a racist, whatever you want.
[03:48:56.320 --> 03:49:01.442]  You therefore are controlling me and dominating me by socially accepted speech patterns.
[03:49:01.442 --> 03:49:05.064]  So socially accepted political correctness, right?
[03:49:05.064 --> 03:49:07.385]  So it is a form of weaponry.
[03:49:07.865 --> 03:49:14.470]  of ideological and verbal weaponry that can be used and deployed at any time with the full backing of the establishment.
[03:49:14.470 --> 03:49:17.032]  This has never happened before in the United States.
[03:49:17.032 --> 03:49:24.537]  The establishment now has a weapons system, an ideological weapons system, that its own followers are deploying.
[03:49:24.537 --> 03:49:26.919]  So, I agree with you, it's in the colleges.
[03:49:26.919 --> 03:49:28.260]  It's not just young people, though.
[03:49:28.260 --> 03:49:32.282]  I mean, you can talk to anyone of all walks of life, and they will deploy this weapons system.
[03:49:32.282 --> 03:49:37.226]  They will take out their bazooka gun of political correctness and blow you away if you let them.
[03:49:37.586 --> 03:49:38.487]  And I've seen it happen.
[03:49:38.487 --> 03:49:45.216]  I've actually been out and someone said something to this, you know, college-age girl and it wasn't, it wasn't, it was nothing.
[03:49:45.216 --> 03:49:47.719]  It was seriously a silly little funny joke.
[03:49:47.719 --> 03:49:49.281]  He was actually trying to be nice.
[03:49:49.281 --> 03:49:52.765]  And the girl, oh my god, started freaking out and crying.
[03:49:52.765 --> 03:49:55.008]  Told him he was such a sexist jerk and all this kind of stuff.
[03:49:55.008 --> 03:49:55.949]  And the problem is...
[03:49:56.960 --> 03:50:02.385]  When you let these people dominate you like that, and you say, oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean anything like that, please!
[03:50:02.385 --> 03:50:07.170]  You're playing into the system, and you lose the game when you play the game, because they run the game.
[03:50:07.170 --> 03:50:12.174]  The political correctness system is a game, and when you play, you lose.
[03:50:12.174 --> 03:50:20.642]  The answer is not to play the game, because you know you're a good person, you know you actually care about people, you know you're not racist, you know you're not sexist, you're not going to play the game, man!
[03:50:21.658 --> 03:50:22.458]  I'm not going to play it.
[03:50:22.458 --> 03:50:24.039]  I'm not going to be dominated by it.
[03:50:24.039 --> 03:50:28.460]  When someone tries to dominate me with political correctness, tell them to get lost.
[03:50:28.460 --> 03:50:34.782]  Because I know what I am, and I'm not going to be labeled things, and people use labels as a form of control.
[03:50:34.782 --> 03:50:36.062]  Anthony, thank you for your call.
[03:50:36.062 --> 03:50:37.782]  Those are some great points in Florida.
[03:50:37.782 --> 03:50:47.985]  We're going to take some more calls coming back and cover a little bit of this crazy news, including a tortoise of age 183 and the Vietnam probe's mysterious space balls.
[03:50:47.985 --> 03:50:49.206]  We'll be right back.
[03:50:49.206 --> 03:50:50.346]  This is the Alex Jones 4th Hour.

[03:54:08.402 --> 03:54:10.923]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:10.923 --> 03:54:17.586]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi, and it's been a really fun hour hanging out with you guys and taking your calls.
[03:54:17.586 --> 03:54:25.110]  You know, it's my birthday today, and if I felt old at all, here is a story to also help you feel quite young.
[03:54:25.110 --> 03:54:32.213]  World's oldest living animal, Jonathan the tortoise, gets a new lease of life after a vet puts him on a healthy diet at the age of 183.
[03:54:35.109 --> 03:54:37.610]  This giant tortoise has lived on the island of St.
[03:54:37.610 --> 03:54:40.350]  Helena in South Atlantic since 1882.
[03:54:40.350 --> 03:54:47.072]  He was on his last leg after his health seriously declined, including losing his eyesight and sense of smell.
[03:54:47.072 --> 03:54:56.114]  But this vet has now given him a new diet of high-calorie fruit and vegetables with apples and guava, and he's now good and he's fine.
[03:54:56.114 --> 03:55:00.055]  He's back to great health at 183 years old, and who knows how long he'll live.
[03:55:00.055 --> 03:55:00.755]  So good for him.
[03:55:00.755 --> 03:55:01.895]  Good for Jonathan the tortoise.
[03:55:03.621 --> 03:55:06.123]  Vietnam probes mysterious space balls.
[03:55:06.123 --> 03:55:08.404]  I had to pick this one because of the headline.
[03:55:08.404 --> 03:55:19.951]  Vietnam's military is investigating the appearance of three mysterious metal balls, believed to be debris from space, which landed in the country's remote north, a senior Army official said Friday.
[03:55:19.951 --> 03:55:25.894]  Two metal balls discovered in the northwestern Yanbai province on January 2nd, Army spokesman told AFP.
[03:55:25.894 --> 03:55:27.575]  So that's interesting, probably some satellite debris.
[03:55:28.843 --> 03:55:29.924]  Not that big of a deal.
[03:55:29.924 --> 03:55:33.686]  Google translated Russia to Mordor in automated error.
[03:55:33.686 --> 03:55:34.847]  This is interesting.
[03:55:34.847 --> 03:55:41.572]  Google has fixed a bug in an online tool after it began translating Russian Federation to Mordor.
[03:55:41.572 --> 03:55:46.375]  Mordor is the name, obviously, of a fictional region nicknamed Land of Shadow in Lord of the Rings.
[03:55:46.375 --> 03:55:49.817]  You know, that was an interesting mistake there, Google.
[03:55:49.817 --> 03:55:51.738]  Accidentally translating Russia to Mordor.
[03:55:51.738 --> 03:55:54.080]  I'm sure it's just an automated error.
[03:55:55.504 --> 03:56:01.268]  And Europe will send humans back to the moon by 2030 to start colonizing.
[03:56:01.268 --> 03:56:10.914]  NASA and the private space industry has its sights set on putting a human on Mars, but in Europe, slightly more modest goals, it wants to put humans back on the moon and build a base.
[03:56:10.914 --> 03:56:12.536]  That's the kind of thing I can get behind.
[03:56:12.536 --> 03:56:14.697]  Let's hit some calls.
[03:56:14.697 --> 03:56:17.659]  Let's talk to Angie all the way in Alaska.
[03:56:17.659 --> 03:56:21.141]  She wants to talk about Obama impeachment.
[03:56:21.141 --> 03:56:21.742]  What's up, Angie?
[03:56:23.286 --> 03:56:31.675]  I just wanted to say that I know in Alaska we have a lot of listeners and our representative Don Young, he is listening to our calls.
[03:56:31.675 --> 03:56:38.002]  He's listening to what we have to say and he sometimes is crass but he's got a voice.
[03:56:38.002 --> 03:56:43.048]  And I know every man, woman, anybody who I've seen fishing
[03:56:43.766 --> 03:56:47.448]  Snowmobiling, floor-by-flooring, I mean, anybody.
[03:56:47.448 --> 03:56:49.189]  We all talk about the same things.
[03:56:49.189 --> 03:56:53.151]  We all are concerned about what the President is doing.
[03:56:53.151 --> 03:56:55.332]  We open carry-up here.
[03:56:55.332 --> 03:56:57.253]  We protect our families.
[03:56:57.253 --> 03:57:02.416]  There's been many a times when home invasions have been thwarted because we have protected our own homes.
[03:57:02.416 --> 03:57:10.140]  And I'm imploring every Alaskan, heck, everybody in the United States, please call your representative.
[03:57:10.140 --> 03:57:12.502]  Tell them to support the IMC.
[03:57:12.502 --> 03:57:13.002]  Tell them that
[03:57:13.522 --> 03:57:15.284]  We're tired of all this overreaching.
[03:57:15.284 --> 03:57:26.255]  I mean, they're coming and taking our federal lands left and right up here in Alaska, and we love to hunt and fish, and we are good conservationists, and we spend time with our kids.
[03:57:26.255 --> 03:57:29.097]  Sometimes roads are closed and we can't even go barret picking.
[03:57:29.097 --> 03:57:34.102]  We need to wake up and wake our House of Representatives up and tell them, we're done with this.
[03:57:34.102 --> 03:57:34.723]  This is enough.
[03:57:35.985 --> 03:57:43.388]  Our state is in a decline in the economy and we need to stop them because we're no longer going to have jobs if we don't stop them.
[03:57:44.172 --> 03:57:48.994]  You know, I know several people from Alaska, actually, and the community is really, really beautiful.
[03:57:48.994 --> 03:58:00.618]  It's an example in a lot of ways of what we used to have, you know, years and years ago, where families actually come together and they eat together and they go out and they pick berries, as she was saying, and do all these really, really fun things.
[03:58:00.618 --> 03:58:06.880]  And it is a shame that the federal government, of course, just has to crush over and over again all the things that are wholesome and good in many different ways.
[03:58:07.720 --> 03:58:08.861]  Well, thanks so much for watching.
[03:58:08.861 --> 03:58:11.983]  This has been the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show Overdrive.
[03:58:11.983 --> 03:58:15.725]  It's always my pleasure to be invited to join and speak with you guys.
[03:58:15.725 --> 03:58:17.666]  I'm Anthony Guciardi, and thanks so much.
[03:58:17.666 --> 03:58:21.128]  Let's charge into 2016 and make reality viral.
