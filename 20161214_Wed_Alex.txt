[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:12.000 --> 00:19.000]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[00:19.000 --> 00:29.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:29.000 --> 00:38.000]  Wednesday, December 14th, 2016. Again, it's hard to believe that this year is almost over.
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  We will plunge into 2017 and things are only going to get more interesting.
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.000]  All over the world, there are populist revolutions against tyranny.
[00:47.000 --> 00:55.000]  And if you read an actual establishment publication, the type of communication they have between governments,
[00:55.000 --> 01:01.000]  between ambassadors, between Fortune 100 companies, between think tanks,
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.000]  they're very, very clear about the planetary government, how they're trying to dumb people down,
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.000]  how they're trying to end the family, how they're trying to end hope, how they're trying to make humans obsolete,
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  how they're trying to consolidate media, how they're trying to phase out cash,
[01:15.000 --> 01:22.000]  how they're trying to phase out normal barter systems and normal human sustainable communities.
[01:22.000 --> 01:29.000]  In the name of sustainability, everything's upside down.
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.000]  But they're in trouble.
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  But instead of backing off, they are intensifying their operations.
[01:37.000 --> 01:43.000]  So the immovable object is about to run into the unstoppable force.
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  And when that happens, you get a big bang.
[01:48.000 --> 01:55.000]  And the big bangs politically and militarily we've had before have killed hundreds of millions of people in the last century.
[01:55.000 --> 02:04.000]  When the world had about half the population it does now, on average, in the aggregate.
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  And we didn't have the weapons we have now.
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  So I'll just be honest with you, that's all I can do.
[02:12.000 --> 02:24.000]  If I was a selfish man, I'd be selling everything I've got and getting out of the United States or Europe.
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.000]  I'd be getting out of the Middle East.
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  I'd be getting out of Latin America.
[02:29.000 --> 02:31.000]  I'd be getting out of Africa.
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.000]  I'd be getting out of many areas in Asia.
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.000]  And there's not many safe places to go.
[02:36.000 --> 02:42.000]  I mean, maybe some tiny islands in the South Pacific.
[02:42.000 --> 02:46.000]  And then what you're only safe for a little while.
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.000]  There's a lot of positive movements happening.
[02:48.000 --> 02:50.000]  But again, a lot of negative movements happening.
[02:50.000 --> 02:58.000]  And they're coming together like a spring storm when the cold weather is running into the hot weather.
[02:58.000 --> 02:59.000]  What do you get?
[02:59.000 --> 03:09.000]  Giant strings of tornadoes, maelstroms, black squalls, floods.
[03:09.000 --> 03:16.000]  But the floods we're going to have here are collapsing borders, disenfranchised third-world starving populations,
[03:16.000 --> 03:25.000]  warlords, military kingpins, mercenary combines, leaking nuclear reactors, collapsing infrastructure,
[03:25.000 --> 03:34.000]  corrupt decadent, disconnected elites, weaponized media, even dumbing people down more.
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  The answer is prosperity and innovation and a purpose-driven life.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  The globalists don't want purpose-driven people.
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  They want cogs that fit neatly into algorithms.
[03:47.000 --> 03:56.000]  And so because our world predominantly in the last 60 years has been envisioned by a group of psychological hijackers,
[03:56.000 --> 04:04.000]  we are now entering into a very, very dangerous, tumultuous time.
[04:04.000 --> 04:05.000]  We come back.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  I'm going to do my best.
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  That's all I can try to do to cover the news.
[04:11.000 --> 04:19.000]  There is a ridiculous graphic being sent around the web, just like all these other anonymous lists.
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  One was made by a professor lady saying what was real news, what wasn't.
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  She had to withdraw it because of lawsuit threats.
[04:25.000 --> 04:32.000]  Washington Post admitted that some unnamed group had given them a list that they claimed was listing who the Russian-controlled media was.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  They retracted that last Wednesday.
[04:34.000 --> 04:42.000]  Well, now they've got another nebulous, unsourced document floating around.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  And it's hilarious.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  Even you want some humor, baby.
[04:48.000 --> 04:49.000]  We're about to give it to you.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  But I'm going to use this graph to actually break down from my view.
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  It's based on history and reality and real research.
[04:57.000 --> 04:58.000]  Who really is who?
[04:58.000 --> 04:59.000]  Straight ahead.
[04:59.000 --> 05:00.000]  Stay with us.
[05:00.000 --> 05:10.000]  The fraud and chief, Barack Hussein Obama, went on the Comedy Central fake news program, The Daily Show, to talk to Trevor nobody knows you about the alleged Russian hacking.
[05:10.000 --> 05:22.000]  What they did here, hacking some emails and releasing them, is not a particularly fancy brand of espionage or propaganda.
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.000]  Here he stutters after his lie, then never denies the legitimacy of the emails.
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  The emails are real. The corruption is real.
[05:30.000 --> 05:43.000]  So that the public and our elected representatives going forward can find ways to prevent this kind of interference from having an impact on the elections in the future.
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  These are the people that want the world government, want foreign influence.
[05:46.000 --> 05:51.000]  But now it is a problem when Russia is allegedly hacking US officials to expose corruption.
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  Isn't that what these people want?
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  A world government as a watchdog for corruption?
[05:55.000 --> 05:59.000]  This is Owen Shroyer for more. Go to infowars.com.
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.000]  At all. It ain't gonna sit well.
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[06:30.000 --> 06:33.000]  It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand paul reveres.
[06:33.000 --> 06:39.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  And beef was for supper.
[06:41.000 --> 06:48.000]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[06:48.000 --> 06:56.000]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin. Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue?
[06:56.000 --> 07:00.000]  Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it.
[07:00.000 --> 07:07.000]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense probiotic.
[07:07.000 --> 07:21.000]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[07:21.000 --> 07:33.000]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[07:33.000 --> 07:40.000]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[07:40.000 --> 07:49.000]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at infowarslife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[07:49.000 --> 08:17.000]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first round of the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the info war.
[08:17.000 --> 08:26.000]  It's Wednesday, December 14, 2016. We are now 36 days out from the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States.
[08:26.000 --> 08:33.000]  If this feat can be attained, it will be a giant leap for humanity against the forces of globalism.
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  Lord, let's hear the Alex Jones Show.
[08:38.000 --> 08:45.000]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide from the infowars.com news studios.
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  You got to say number one enemy of the New World Order after Donald Trump.
[08:51.000 --> 08:55.000]  We are honored to be here and very, very thankful.
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  Thank you for joining us today.
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  Where to begin?
[09:02.000 --> 09:12.000]  Judge Deal's death blow to anti-Trump faithful selectors says that they must basically honor the popular vote that's from Clifford Cunningham upon infowars.com.
[09:12.000 --> 09:22.000]  20 Trump delegates could flip, we're being told. The group was openly run by a think tank, control of the Democrats and the Clintons, and it's headed up by Nancy Pelosi's daughter.
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  Can't make that up.
[09:25.000 --> 09:36.000]  Trump appoints immigration hawk Stephen Miller as senior policy advisor, 30 year old, former top sessons aide, advises Trump.
[09:36.000 --> 09:43.000]  Populous earthquake makes 2017 the great unknown. That's right. It's populism, nationalism, not racism.
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  It's awakening to the corporate global government.
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  So that's just some of the news in that stack.
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  We've got the really big news.
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.000]  Proof foreign governments did interfere in the election to help Hillary Clinton.
[09:59.000 --> 10:12.000]  The communist Chinese and Saudi Arabia wrote news articles in their state run media bragging they'd given hundreds of millions into the campaign, but because they control the Justice Department, no charges.
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  But they're saying the Russians hacked it.
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.000]  Now they're saying that the UK, UKIP was run by the Russians and then so the vote should be ignored.
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  And Italy trying to pull out of the EU, that should be ignored last week.
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  On and on and on.
[10:28.000 --> 10:36.000]  I don't think we have even begun to wake up to what Russia is doing when it comes to cyber warfare.
[10:36.000 --> 10:42.000]  Not only their interference now proven in the American presidential campaign, probably in our own referendum last year.
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  We don't have the evidence for that yet, but I think it's highly probable.
[10:45.000 --> 10:55.000]  Certainly in the French presidential election they will be involved and there are already serious concerns in the German secret service that Russia is already interfering in the elections coming up.
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  We've got to wake up to this. When are we going to wake up to this?
[10:58.000 --> 11:06.000]  It's like a baby Keith Oberman. That's from the British Parliament there in the UK and London.
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  Notice he said it's been proven.
[11:10.000 --> 11:17.000]  It's been proven, according to Ben Bradshaw, a member of parliament in the UK, that Russia hacked the US election.
[11:17.000 --> 11:18.000]  No, it hasn't.
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.000]  Turns out the other 16 intelligence agencies say no, we don't concur with this.
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  There's no evidence, no intent.
[11:24.000 --> 11:32.000]  It's not real, but the news media says all 17 agencies agree Russia did it.
[11:32.000 --> 11:48.000]  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and China as well as the EU bragged that they were involved in our elections and used their state run media that goes into the United States like BBC here in the US to lobby against Trump.
[11:48.000 --> 11:58.000]  Plus percent of the coverage of Trump was negative. We all know that, but no, no, no, the Russians with a GDP of Italy and a population of like 180 million people.
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.000]  It supposedly overpowered the whole world. People aren't mad at globalism.
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  People aren't voting against the corporate takeover. People aren't voting against austerity.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  No, no, they love it.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  It was the Russians.
[12:13.000 --> 12:22.000]  Meanwhile, CNN again in a new statement says national emergency CNN urges press to blame Trump went on Russia.
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.000]  I just mentioned that Russia conspiracy theory spreads the UK parliament now Putin blamed for Brexit.
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  This man is all powerful.
[12:32.000 --> 12:41.000]  Imagine if we could cut into the Kremlin and actually hear what Putin saying over his different TV screens like a James Bond villain talking to his minions.
[12:41.000 --> 12:47.000]  My evil extends across all time. All galaxies, all dimensions.
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  Look into me one last time.
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.000]  This is Putin. Trump do as I say.
[12:53.000 --> 13:04.000]  Nice of a Raj do as I say. Alex Jones do as I say. Italian voters do as I say.
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  Icelanders, you are under my control.
[13:10.000 --> 13:17.000]  Brazil wants to pull out of the global union because of Putin.
[13:17.000 --> 13:25.000]  All across the world, people are angry at the IMF and World Bank, not for abusing them, not for austerity, not for robbing them,
[13:25.000 --> 13:51.000]  but because of the mighty or powerful, multi-variant, multi-dimensional, colossus destructor maximus supremo Vladimir Putin.
[13:51.000 --> 13:58.000]  The day of doom is here. Hold on.
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.000]  Yes, master, what do I do?
[14:01.000 --> 14:06.000]  But I like the IMF and World Bank being taxed except for them raising my taxes and saying that my children belong to the government.
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.000]  I like Obamacare Dublin tripling prices. I like the borders wide open. I like being told them a bit of clinger.
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  Putin don't order me to fight the new order. I love it. It's because you're telling me to fight them that I'm fighting them.
[14:17.000 --> 14:25.000]  Oh, wait. Yes, master, as Putin says. Thank you, master.
[14:25.000 --> 14:35.000]  We've reached the point where they have Democratic congressman on Fox News at the same table with Tucker Carlson overlooking the White House.
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.000]  Oh, you were for the Russians then, huh?
[14:38.000 --> 14:44.000]  And see, Carlson starts laughing, but it's not a laughing matter and I get laughing at it too.
[14:44.000 --> 14:54.000]  They mean business, folks. They mean to tell the sheeple out there that we really are evil people.
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.000]  Before I go off the rails here, let me get back to the other news.
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.000]  Here's some good news and I've always pointed this out. As you decriminalize drugs, drug use goes down.
[15:05.000 --> 15:15.000]  You do not make it legal, just like you don't sell ever clear 200 proof to people under 21.
[15:15.000 --> 15:21.000]  You have it controlled, you tax it, you regulate it, and you put up billboards talking about how losers do it.
[15:21.000 --> 15:27.000]  If you make drugs cool, it makes people want to use them. It makes there be huge profits in it.
[15:27.000 --> 15:33.000]  So then people see it as glamorous and avant-garde and that was all done on purpose. That's been declassified.
[15:33.000 --> 15:38.000]  When the whole prohibition thing ended after 10 years in the early 30s,
[15:38.000 --> 15:44.000]  they had to have something new for the black market, for the mafia, and many police departments had been corrupted by it.
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  And the banks were addicted to the drug money, to the alcohol money.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  So they made narcotics illegal that had been sold in drug stores everywhere.
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  You could walk in by heroin, cocaine, you name it, whatever you wanted.
[15:56.000 --> 16:02.000]  And there was a minority of folks that used it, of every race, color, and creed, but it was a small minority.
[16:02.000 --> 16:08.000]  When they made it illegal, within decades, it was everywhere because you created an incentive to push it
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.000]  by making it illegal by putting bigger profits into it. You make it a sad joke, drug use goes down.
[16:13.000 --> 16:19.000]  There are a bunch of European countries, it's well known, like Portugal and others, that have decriminalized drugs, the Netherlands.
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.000]  And it made drugs go way, way down, generally about 50%.
[16:24.000 --> 16:31.000]  Here's the numbers. Drug use and drinking are down amongst U.S. teens massively in a new federal study.
[16:31.000 --> 16:37.000]  Down 22% on the drug front. Now that's just in one year.
[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  Now why is that important? Youth marijuana use down despite greater legalization.
[16:42.000 --> 16:49.000]  Because you're not making it cool anymore, that's why. It's called psychology.
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  That's why they're so stupid in mainstream media trying to ban us.
[16:52.000 --> 17:00.000]  If you think we were kicking your butt before, you openly said we're liars, deceivers, we should be arrested, we should be sued.
[17:00.000 --> 17:13.000]  By you openly having the EU, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, Comedy Central, MPR, The Washington Post, The New York Times, say shut us down.
[17:13.000 --> 17:18.000]  By you doing that, you've only turned us into rock stars.
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  Take it to the whole next level.
[17:21.000 --> 17:29.000]  But again, it's that hubris, it's that delusion in the globalist, that they just can't seem to figure out
[17:29.000 --> 17:35.000]  the mistake they've made that other past corrupt systems have made as well.
[17:35.000 --> 17:39.000]  So we're going to talk about that some more.
[17:39.000 --> 17:46.000]  There are problems though. Kids as young as 8 suspected in violent early morning robbery in Fort Greene inside of New York.
[17:46.000 --> 17:51.000]  Some of the best soldiers are 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 years old because they're fearless.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  Wonder who's behind it though.
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  So we're going to get into all of this.
[17:55.000 --> 18:02.000]  We've got really big news on the Trump effect. Lawmakers now fixing California's government fueled water crisis.
[18:02.000 --> 18:05.000]  All Trump had to do was make a phone call.
[18:05.000 --> 18:12.000]  IBM to hire another 25,000 jobs they announced because of Trump. That's Daily Mail.
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.000]  If you don't like Trump, you can move to Venezuela that's basically has almost no electricity.
[18:16.000 --> 18:20.000]  People are now eating their dogs and cats.
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  Whole things collapsing.
[18:24.000 --> 18:29.000]  Cities in Sweden told to prepare for war because of the Islamic invasion.
[18:29.000 --> 18:35.000]  And when we come back from break, XCIA chiefs says Trump risk blame for an attack if he skips briefings.
[18:35.000 --> 18:41.000]  They're really beating this drum when Trump is getting briefings from Booz Allen and from others.
[18:41.000 --> 18:48.000]  And Wall Street has consortium systems they can subscribe to for millions a year, which Trump does,
[18:48.000 --> 18:54.000]  that gives you intel above intel where the intelligence agencies actually get their information out of the raw feeds
[18:54.000 --> 18:59.000]  from Google, Facebook, Twitter, the stock market and foreign governments.
[18:59.000 --> 19:05.000]  The CIA folks now gets its intel from corporate sources about 90% of it.
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  So it just shows the total antiquated bull.
[19:08.000 --> 19:16.000]  The CIA is a political discredited lie factory well known.
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  He said that six months ago. He goes, I don't want those briefings.
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  They're going to lie to me.
[19:21.000 --> 19:27.000]  Because he's being advised by top generals that were there when Obama ordered them to aid Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  And that's all coming out in the news today as well.
[19:29.000 --> 19:32.000]  We're going to go to break. Don't forget it's only running until this Friday.

[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  We use cell phones against our heads every day.

[23:52.000 --> 24:21.000]  Thanks for keeping our American dream alive, the original Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[24:21.000 --> 24:33.000]  I'm going to come back in the next long segment. I'm going to go over this ridiculous chart that the mainstream media is passing around and promoting that shows what trusted media is and what it isn't.
[24:33.000 --> 24:41.000]  And it is so ridiculous. It's so over-the-top deceptive that it's comical but also very dangerous.
[24:41.000 --> 24:52.000]  Coming up in the next segment, we're also going to get to Europe, including France, and England are going to have to build big walls to keep the illegals out.
[24:52.000 --> 25:03.000]  You go, what do you mean England has a big English channel like 80 miles across from France and it's coastline there in Normandy and Burgundy.
[25:03.000 --> 25:13.000]  But the illegals go through the tunnel and jump on the trains, so they're going to build walls on both sides so they can't even get in to the ferry enclosures and to the tunnel enclosures
[25:13.000 --> 25:20.000]  because they're hijacking the trucks, everything and just busting through the police every day. It's bedlam.
[25:20.000 --> 25:27.000]  And cities in Sweden are told to prepare for war, migrant crisis spiraling out of control. That's infowars.com.
[25:27.000 --> 25:38.000]  Paul links the local reports in Sweden. This is not in the news. They've declared civil emergency in France and Sweden on the highways.
[25:38.000 --> 25:52.000]  It's like something out of a zombie movie. We've shown the videos here where you drive over a hill and 20,000 invading Islamists just pull you out of your car, rape your wife, kill you, and it's just hardly even in the news.
[25:52.000 --> 25:59.000]  We've reached total cuckoo land. But first...
[26:23.000 --> 26:33.000]  No more Wonder Woman. I guess that means no more Leanne McAdoo.
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.000]  Now the world is ready for you.
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  Yes, Linda Carter, please tie me up in the last little immediately.
[26:42.000 --> 26:51.000]  Now, I was like a brunette with blue eyes, huh guys? I like ladies every shape, color, and eye color you name it. I just love God's creations.
[26:51.000 --> 26:59.000]  Now, let's get serious here. Wonder Woman, the UN has said she's too white and so she can no longer be an ambassador to the United Nations.
[26:59.000 --> 27:10.000]  They've always had every supermodel, no matter what color they are, has to pledge allegiance to the United Nations and every Miss America has to say what she plans to do with her life is help UNICEF and the children.
[27:10.000 --> 27:18.000]  Total cover for the evil of the United Nations and its mass murder operations and child kidnapping rings that it publicly runs worldwide.
[27:18.000 --> 27:25.000]  The New York Times will call that fake news. You can just Google UN sex trade. They are the kings of it. Dinecore has been caught. You name it.
[27:25.000 --> 27:31.000]  UN to end Wonder Woman's role. This is London Guardian as an honorary ambassador because she's attractive and white.
[27:31.000 --> 27:42.000]  Oh, I'm sorry. Being attractive, hateful too, because you might not be attractive. Plans to use superhero in an honorary role and employment campaign to fight for gender equality,
[27:42.000 --> 27:51.000]  promote criticism that the choice sent the wrong messages. London Guardian. Isn't that just darling?
[27:51.000 --> 28:00.000]  Now, continuing, all over the country, they've said at colleges, don't show paintings of the football team or men being masculine, even if they're black,
[28:00.000 --> 28:10.000]  because a man being masculine is aggressive and has hints of rape. And they're now, you know, they have that song, Come Inside, Honey, It's Cold Outside.
[28:10.000 --> 28:19.000]  You know that song? Last week they announced that's not going to be aired because saying, hey, come inside, it's cold, it's warm in here with a woman and a sexy voice.
[28:19.000 --> 28:28.000]  That implies rape. Normal human interaction is evil. The big mega state cult says we can't have it. You're not in the science fiction dystopia movie.
[28:28.000 --> 28:38.000]  You're not in THX 1138. You're in 2016. And here it is. There it is. Actors pushed to ban. Baby, it's cold outside.
[28:38.000 --> 28:48.000]  Can we come in in the next segment with that? Can we find that? Thank you. But it gets better. Paul Joseph Watson has an article on this that links directly to the advisory at the college.
[28:48.000 --> 28:56.000]  University says holiday instead of Christmas is not politically correct enough. First, don't say Christmas, say holiday. Then don't say holiday.
[28:56.000 --> 29:02.000]  All over the country, I see these articles every Christmas. It happened here in Texas this year. Do not hand out Christmas cards.
[29:02.000 --> 29:14.000]  See, you have free speech. You have a First Amendment. You can hand out Satanism cards. You can hand out cars about how you love race cars or how you love hiking or how you love a local football team.
[29:14.000 --> 29:21.000]  Whatever you want in your own time at lunch, you can hand out those cards. You can communicate. You can pass out comic books to your friends.
[29:21.000 --> 29:27.000]  You can bring an extra sandwich to your friends. Now they're saying parents shouldn't pack their own lunches for their kids because you can't be trusted.
[29:27.000 --> 29:34.000]  Well, now they're banning it, saying some people don't have holidays in their belief system, so you having one isn't inclusive.
[29:34.000 --> 29:41.000]  Everybody doesn't have a mother or father either. Meanwhile, Trump's given a speech and says we're going to say Merry Christmas again and is seen as radical.
[29:41.000 --> 29:49.000]  This is a cult telling us we can have no culture, but whatever we download on a daily basis from them, let's break free from it. Stay with us. I'm Alex Jones.
[29:49.000 --> 30:00.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.000 --> 30:10.000]  The fraud in chief, Barack Hussein Obama, went on the Comedy Central fake news program, The Daily Show, to talk to Trevor. Nobody knows you about the alleged Russian hacking.
[30:10.000 --> 30:23.000]  What they did here, hacking some emails and releasing them, is not a particularly fancy brand of espionage or propaganda.
[30:23.000 --> 30:31.000]  Here he stutters after his lie, then never denies the legitimacy of the emails. The emails are real. The corruption is real.
[30:31.000 --> 30:43.000]  The public and our elected representatives going forward can find ways to prevent this kind of interference from having an impact on the elections in the future.
[30:43.000 --> 30:52.000]  These are the people that want the world government, want foreign influence, but now it is a problem when Russia is allegedly hacking U.S. officials to expose corruption.
[30:52.000 --> 31:02.000]  Check out what these people want. A world government as a watchdog for corruption. This is Owen Schreuer for more. Go to infowars.com.
[31:23.000 --> 31:38.000]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials. It's one of the most effective substances in the world. It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[31:38.000 --> 31:42.000]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.
[31:42.000 --> 31:52.000]  We have so many five-star reviews. I take this. This is the product that I take. infowarslife.com and the profit we make. We fight the globalists. We fight the new world order.

[32:13.000 --> 32:22.000]  The best part, though, you can take it with you. It's mobile to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[32:22.000 --> 32:29.000]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[32:29.000 --> 32:36.000]  A true innovation. I have never seen anything like this. You're going to want to load up on these. One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[32:36.000 --> 32:44.000]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid. Go to privatepowergrid.com. That's privatepowergrid.com.

[33:10.000 --> 33:27.000]  I really can't stay. But baby, it's cold outside. I've got to go away. But baby, it's cold outside. This evening has been open at you, so very nice. I'll hold your hands. They're just like a mist.
[33:27.000 --> 33:46.000]  My mother will start to worry. And father will be pacing the floor. I guess that's been Crosby and baby, it's cold outside. Imagine a man and a woman of the human species that have huddled together in the cold for eons.
[33:46.000 --> 34:04.000]  Now, talking about it being cold and snowy and you get frisky and you want to go in and curl up in the bed or curl up on the couch in front of the fire and have a cup of coffee or a cup of tea or Lord forbid a little kalula.
[34:04.000 --> 34:13.000]  And there's nothing more horrible than that. So we need this big state and this big media to come insert itself in the middle of that and call for that to be banned as well.
[34:13.000 --> 34:23.000]  That's right. College groups and other organizations are calling for it. We just put it up on screen to ban it. And a lot of radio stations are saying yes, we will.
[34:23.000 --> 34:39.000]  And you see the corporations like that because it's all part of intimidating the public, setting the precedent to ban speech and to make everything hurtful, except Google and others working five years ago to fund the year of spring
[34:39.000 --> 34:56.000]  and overthrow 11 different countries and kill close to a million people, 300 plus thousand in Syria alone. That's liberal to with Saudi Arabia and proxy armies take over and kill Muslims that aren't radical Christians, Jews, you name it,
[34:56.000 --> 35:10.000]  enslave women, shell them into sex slavery, cut their genitals off, throw Catholic priests off the top of buildings, kill Orthodox priests, kill Orthodox nuns. That's cute.
[35:10.000 --> 35:22.000]  That's fun. But don't you say, baby, it's cold outside. No, no, no. No, you don't.
[35:22.000 --> 35:35.000]  And the police in Sweden, the police in Germany have gone public and said, we've been ordered when women are raped or people are even killed to cover it up and say that it was a German that did it or a sweet when it's a illegal.
[35:35.000 --> 35:51.000]  Who was a Somali who was here illegally that stabbed nine people in Ohio? And what did Obama say? Don't say it's Islam. And then now they've got liberal groups coming out saying they're looking at suing the cop because he didn't have a right to shoot a guy running at him with a butcher knife.
[35:51.000 --> 36:08.000]  They've already been running people over with cars. It's all protected. Yeah, let's show some folks. Just go to YouTube and type in migrants storm the tunnel in France or migrants storm out of tunnel in England.
[36:08.000 --> 36:25.000]  And I mean, there's videos going back 10 years. It just shows minute night going like they're Normandy out of the tunnel hanging on trains and the police are ordered to stand down as guys are running by and as soon as they get to social workers or London stand
[36:25.000 --> 36:39.000]  and the Islamic mayor, all free welfare, new identities, whatever they want. And they all just laugh and their imams preach in London and preach in Jerusalem. You are whether they're ours. You are weak. We will breed you out. Whites are evil. Islam rules.
[36:39.000 --> 36:53.000]  And you think, well, Islam's not about color. Oh, they've picked up the whole liberal anti-white thing too. And then I've got in Cologne and in Berlin, the Green Party's in their meetings going, it is good no more white people. Germans are bad.
[36:53.000 --> 37:08.000]  It's white Germans saying it. White women. Now let's go further. In Berlin, the Secretary of State was just elected and she's an Islamist who wants to enforce Sharia law. That was in the news yesterday.
[37:08.000 --> 37:19.000]  But she doesn't wear a headdress or burqa when she's up there and she's got this crazed power look in her eye. Can we pull that up? Berlin's new Secretary of State.
[37:19.000 --> 37:30.000]  No, no, no, excuse me. New Attorney General, excuse me, promotes Sharia law and then it's got quotes of her and it's got her up there on the dais looking like she's on a power trip.
[37:30.000 --> 37:42.000]  What is it about all these globalists? They always have this, like, like, whether it's Hollande or whether it's La Grande or anything. They have these weird, crazed looks in their eyes.
[37:42.000 --> 37:54.000]  Like they're just sheathing with power like some type of villain from a movie.
[37:54.000 --> 38:07.000]  There's actually an m4s.com article linked to the German news. It was Berlin, New Berlin was the Secretary of Territory General. I think the Secretary of State for that state supports Sharia law.
[38:07.000 --> 38:13.000]  Here, let me, let me try. See, I got to get obsessed with these searches. I've got to show people where I can't continue.
[38:13.000 --> 38:28.000]  It's New German. It was like, at least in German, that was Berlin when you read later. New German Secretary Sharia law. Let me get that up right there.
[38:28.000 --> 38:47.000]  This thing is so slow. Keep going here. It doesn't matter how long it takes. New, this thing's got problems. Here we go. New German Secretary Sharia law. Boom.
[38:47.000 --> 38:53.000]  That should bring it up. And let's see. Put it in 4Wars.com behind it, guys, and you'll get it. And we can put that on screen.
[38:53.000 --> 39:01.000]  It's not the cruise bad. They're better searchers than I am most of the time. It's just that sometimes I get this OCD obsession now with showing something and I won't be able to continue.
[39:01.000 --> 39:10.000]  This doesn't have internet. I've got to rebroadcast. Let's go ahead and get a video ready. We have it? Okay. I must have it. I must prove it. I must document it. I must show everyone.
[39:10.000 --> 39:17.000]  We've got a John Bown report that's pretty important anyways, and I want to come back with this key map, and I want to kind of reset for that anyways.
[39:17.000 --> 39:25.000]  This is really big news and really, really important. There it is. Berlin's new Secretary of State is Pro Sharia law, conservative Muslim. Good. That's Breitbart.
[39:25.000 --> 39:31.000]  Now we have an infowars.com headline as well. I don't care who got it first, but I want people to see that. I can show them that it was infowars.
[39:31.000 --> 39:38.000]  So let's put that headline in and let's put infowars.com. There it is. That's what I wanted. Look at the power tripping look in that woman's eyes.
[39:38.000 --> 39:49.000]  And I've been out at the Communist rallies, and the anti-free speech rallies, and the anti-Trump rallies, and it's Muslim women wearing burkas, but their eyes are looking at me just like that.
[39:49.000 --> 39:58.000]  But what is she doing out without her burka on up there lecturing Germans that are wanting to commit cultural suicide? What is she doing?
[39:58.000 --> 40:09.000]  Because under Sharia law, she can't drive a car or do jack crap. I want to know. Because I can't go to most Muslim nations and practice my religion or be free.
[40:09.000 --> 40:18.000]  So don't come here and tell me I'm a bigot because I don't want to go under your control while they're banning Christmas everywhere and saying I can't even say happy holidays in a college.
[40:18.000 --> 40:25.000]  I have free speech. I can say whatever I want. They've got conservatives fooled. They think Thomas Jefferson was wrong.
[40:25.000 --> 40:39.000]  He said separation of Turkey and state in a letter about the First Amendment, explaining that Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[40:39.000 --> 40:45.000]  And then it goes on to the press and the right to assemble the rest of it. You understand that?
[40:45.000 --> 40:55.000]  German minister refuses to wear a hijab during Saudi Arabia visit. These are Merkel called for burqa ban. She's being forced to do that, but then says Germans should assimilate and accept Islam.
[40:55.000 --> 41:02.000]  But why am I getting in all this? Why am I so upset?
[41:02.000 --> 41:13.000]  It's because under the First Amendment, ladies and gentlemen, it guards your religious right because the government can't have an official religion and make you practice it.
[41:13.000 --> 41:26.000]  But we can leave our founding Christian symbols up and we can have nativity scenes. But beyond that now, they're trying to tell individuals if you're at a public event or anything with any government funding that you don't have speech.
[41:26.000 --> 41:34.000]  They even tell churches under 501c3 to tell their practitioners, don't talk about politics at this church lunch. That's pure bull.
[41:34.000 --> 41:42.000]  They're putting blinders and gags on the American people and I'm done.
[41:42.000 --> 41:53.000]  Now, before I go any further, because I've got some over the top incredible news I want to break down today and a bunch of guests, but I've got to get to this.
[41:53.000 --> 42:02.000]  I had no idea how popular this would be. And so I guess we miscalculated on the amount of this toothpaste we bought. That's a great thing because this helps fund our operation.
[42:02.000 --> 42:12.000]  Now, at 995, though, we don't make a lot of money off of it. So order yourself one, stock up on it, buy some for friends and family. This was three years in the making.
[42:12.000 --> 42:22.000]  My father is a chemist, an oral surgeon and a retired dentist. And he's worked again on getting major drugs approved that were herbal supplements.
[42:22.000 --> 42:28.000]  So he knows what he's doing. And we're not allowed because of contractual issues to say who made this because they're a private labeler.
[42:28.000 --> 42:37.000]  But it is the biggest producer of toothpaste in the United States. And it's who makes the leading brand of organic non fluoride toothpaste. I can say that.
[42:37.000 --> 42:44.000]  So just like our colloidal silver is the biggest lab in the country that supplies whole foods with their label on average for $24.95.
[42:44.000 --> 42:51.000]  We sell it for $9.95. It's $9.95 right now. Our colloidal silver silver bullet.
[42:51.000 --> 43:02.000]  Overwide free shipping on everything, 30% off on the other products. It's just a massive sale only until Friday. And we guarantee you'll get it before Christmas in the United States.
[43:02.000 --> 43:12.000]  But we're now launching what my dad developed. And he said, son, I'm going to do it all. He even did the graphics, which a lot of people actually like how simple the graphics are.
[43:12.000 --> 43:16.000]  He even named it. He said, just let me do it because for some reason I couldn't get it done.
[43:16.000 --> 43:23.000]  So that was about a year ago. I've been trying for two years to get this top company to be able to do this to put true iodine in.
[43:23.000 --> 43:31.000]  That's the atomic iodine and nano colloidal silver together in one toothpaste with peppermint and tea tree oil.
[43:31.000 --> 43:38.000]  My dad just rants and raves about this. I've been using it for several months before it finally came in on the 18 wheeler made right here in America.
[43:38.000 --> 43:45.000]  This is unbelievable. This is hands down. I'm going to move to put this in stores.
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.000]  I don't have any of our products. I'm going to move to do it kind of a fancier label.
[43:49.000 --> 43:56.000]  I don't know if people kind of like this, this, this, this simple label. Super blue is the name because real iodine turns blue, not red.
[43:56.000 --> 44:06.000]  So it's blue color isn't coloring. It comes out white turns blue once you start adding oxygen, showing that the iodine is then activating.
[44:06.000 --> 44:14.000]  It's incredible. And then it's got colloidal silver. You talk about amazing nano silver iodine, peppermint oil, xylitol.
[44:14.000 --> 44:23.000]  And other key ingredients. And it's fluoride free, made and developed right here in the USA.
[44:23.000 --> 44:29.000]  It's $9.95, normally $12. It's discounted out of the gauge. It's available at infowarstore.com.
[44:29.000 --> 44:36.000]  You can call toll free as well. Super blue, non fluoride toothpaste with iodine nano silver recommended by Alex Jones.
[44:36.000 --> 44:45.000]  Four ounces. It's a big container. Info wars life. Super blue.
[44:45.000 --> 44:54.000]  And getting into what happens with gencivitis and how a lot of ventricle infections in the heart cause by bad hygiene.
[44:54.000 --> 45:05.000]  You got a floss. You got a brush. You got to get scaled three times a year. And I'm telling you folks what iodine does and what fluoride, you know, countering systems do.
[45:05.000 --> 45:09.000]  Like the iodine, which is the good halogen. It's amazing.

[45:42.000 --> 45:49.000]  Now, by the way, earlier, it has nothing to do with the crew. I've never been OCD in my life.
[45:49.000 --> 45:56.000]  But now I've got no CD about if I'm talking about something particularly and I want to see it and then I can't find it.
[45:56.000 --> 46:01.000]  I just get it, you know, I just get neurotic and I apologize. Nothing to do with the crew. I just, I kind of freeze up now.
[46:01.000 --> 46:09.000]  And I'm like, if I've got to show people where they say this, if I, if I'm making a claim, I've got to show you because it's so incredible.
[46:09.000 --> 46:19.000]  And I wanted to see her hateful face for TV viewers, her power tripping face, her hypocritical face when she supports Sharia law and slaving women,
[46:19.000 --> 46:26.000]  making them wear burkas and she's out running around openly not doing it in this open, inclusive Western country that's brought her in.
[46:26.000 --> 46:33.000]  And then she basically is just arrogantly angry about it, trying to make us convert to her cult.
[46:33.000 --> 46:41.000]  I'm done. Now, before I go any further, speaking of how they're banning Wonder Woman saying she's attractive and she's white so the UN doesn't want her anymore,
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.000]  but we don't want you UN. And again, I love everybody.
[46:45.000 --> 46:52.000]  I love all. It's just, it's this thing that whiteness is inherently evil. Get rid of it.
[46:52.000 --> 46:58.000]  It's, it's just, it's just sick. They're trying to create racism, classism, sexism.
[46:58.000 --> 47:03.000]  They're trying to create a total class of civilizations and it's evil. It's wrong.
[47:03.000 --> 47:10.000]  I'm not against Islam in general. It's had some good ages in it and had some developments, but it's, it's very aggressive right now.
[47:10.000 --> 47:15.000]  Very cancerous. It's dominating and enslaving Muslims all around them, taking over the world.
[47:15.000 --> 47:20.000]  Muslims kill more of each other than anybody else. It's, it's, it needs reformation.
[47:20.000 --> 47:26.000]  The Democratic Party needs to be reformed. The Republican Party does. The elites are out of control.
[47:26.000 --> 47:31.000]  They're disconnected and they're teaming up with any authoritarianism to suppress the people.
[47:31.000 --> 47:38.000]  And then you've got all these black leaders, formerly Jesse Jackson, James Brown, you name it.
[47:38.000 --> 47:47.000]  James Brown, Jim Brown and so many others that have known Trump for 40 years and know that the guy's super nice, super cool,
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.000]  hires a ton of African Americans when they're qualified, hires white people when they're qualified.
[47:52.000 --> 47:59.000]  Just, just goes off how hard working you are and promotes people and, and bought up these racist golf courses 35 years ago,
[47:59.000 --> 48:04.000]  the last two in the country that didn't let blacks and Jews in and made them all inclusive.
[48:04.000 --> 48:11.000]  They just know it's not true. So they've come out in defense of Trump and they're being demonized
[48:11.000 --> 48:18.000]  by the race pimping folks on CNN, MSNBC, who know full well what they're doing.
[48:18.000 --> 48:25.000]  So here we've got a video, NFL legends, praise Donald Trump, Jim Brown, Ray Lewis and others are now guilty of Trump being all black,
[48:25.000 --> 48:31.000]  like Kanye West, who isn't perfect, but is now divorced from his wife and says he's getting out of the liberal garbage
[48:31.000 --> 48:36.000]  and you don't believe the lies about Trump. He's known him for years and came out in support of him and then didn't hit anybody,
[48:36.000 --> 48:44.000]  didn't attack anybody. They said, you need to settle down your crazy and grabbed him and locked him up in a mental institution for almost two weeks.
[48:44.000 --> 48:51.000]  Now the media is demonizing him as he dare visits president elect. He took the red pill.
[48:51.000 --> 48:59.000]  Like Trump said, black unemployment has almost doubled under Obama. What do you got to lose?
[48:59.000 --> 49:04.000]  He's calling for these companies to invest in urban mainly black areas.
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.000]  That's part of the phone calls is anyone will really make me happy.
[49:08.000 --> 49:14.000]  I'm going to get that tax on corporations cut is I want you to move into these burnout urban centers.
[49:14.000 --> 49:22.000]  It's beyond real political correctness. It's actually bringing prosperity and self respect that will end all this poverty and crap
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.000]  that the globalists are pushing to control us.
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  Now, let's get to this clip because then the media comes out and demonizes it.
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.000]  Here's NFL legends praise Donald Trump. I'm going to get to this incredible map. Here we go.
[49:35.000 --> 49:43.000]  And to me, it's a match made in heaven. It's it's something that rather than go out and try to invent a vehicle to enhance the African American community.
[49:43.000 --> 49:53.000]  We have a vehicle in place that we need the country to get behind not just this administration, but for the country to get behind so we can affect positive change in our communities.
[49:53.000 --> 49:58.000]  Oh, thank you.
[49:58.000 --> 50:06.000]  Couldn't have been a better meeting. The graciousness, the intelligence, the reception we got was fantastic.
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  What are some of the specific policies you guys talked about?
[50:10.000 --> 50:24.000]  Well, I think I think if you talk about what we're trying to really do from the urban developments and job creations are everything. But I think, you know, we're talking about really what entrepreneurship really looks like from from the individual themselves.
[50:24.000 --> 50:34.000]  And I think what America America camp program has done for so many years is put us at that place. And now we have 30 40,000 former game members and people who's changed their lives.
[50:34.000 --> 50:43.000]  Well, what we believe with the Trump administration is if we can combine these two powers of coming together, forget black or white, black or white is irrelevant.
[50:43.000 --> 50:53.000]  The bottom line is job creation, economic development in these urban neighborhoods to change the whole scheme of what what our kids see for our next few years.
[50:53.000 --> 51:09.000]  I think what I do feel is that he's wide open to really helping us change what hasn't been changed. You know, you talk about you go all the way back 22 trillion dollars since the Johnson, since President Johnson was around.
[51:09.000 --> 51:17.000]  And you think about what that is, what Tom, I really saw a solvent poverty 22 trillion that we haven't addressed yet. Right.
[51:17.000 --> 51:24.000]  So for us as a black community, for Trump's even step up there for Mr. President to step up there and say, I'm going to do that. That means everything.
[51:24.000 --> 51:27.000]  And I think that's why me and Mr. Brown is here today.
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  No, I did not.
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  The election is over. We don't need to talk about that. We need to talk about going forward.
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.000]  We're not here to talk about the past. We're here to talk about going forward.
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  I've been listening to and we definitely have a partnership.
[51:42.000 --> 51:48.000]  And it's an extension of the outreach program that we put in place that you follow so very closely.
[51:48.000 --> 51:53.000]  Mr. Trump made a commitment to improving the conditions of the lives of African Americans in this country.
[51:53.000 --> 52:03.000]  And this is going to continue the work that we started during this campaign with the National Diversity Coalition and now with American Jim Brown, Ray Lewis, and it's a great combination.
[52:03.000 --> 52:07.000]  And the President-elect was very enthusiastic about it and committed to doing it.
[52:07.000 --> 52:12.000]  I think he was excited. He's made a commitment. He's given a verbal commitment.
[52:12.000 --> 52:17.000]  This was the first of many meetings. He's given us a verbal commitment and then we're going to go forward.
[52:17.000 --> 52:21.000]  We're going to strategize and then the next step will be implementation.
[52:21.000 --> 52:25.000]  We're not going to drag our feet talking about this for the next three years.
[52:25.000 --> 52:31.000]  This is something that we're, the vehicle is already in place. The model already works.
[52:31.000 --> 52:37.000]  We're just going to energize and empower this model. Put the government behind it. Put the Trump administration behind it.
[52:37.000 --> 52:42.000]  Put the African American community behind it. Put the American community behind it. And we're going to get busy.
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  I notice those are all really smart, cool, sharp, good-looking guys.
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  And there's tons of black men like that. You never see them on the news.
[52:50.000 --> 52:58.000]  They put these Don Lemon types, all effeminate, worshiping the government, worshiping corruption, worshiping welfare checks to keep people under control.
[52:58.000 --> 53:03.000]  I'm talking about election LBJ. Because I've read the writings of the particular NFL current player.
[53:03.000 --> 53:08.000]  He's talking about LBJ saying, I'll have the n-words vote in Democrats for 100 years.
[53:08.000 --> 53:13.000]  It was about kicking men out of the house, domesticating people and they've done it in 60 years.
[53:13.000 --> 53:23.000]  $22 trillion to screw up a community, not to help it, to induct you into prison and Trump means on delivering jobs high-paying.
[53:23.000 --> 53:28.240]  the world is so angry at him because the globalists thought they'd won and the
[53:28.240 --> 53:31.000]  model they've done in the black areas is the model for everybody look at the
[53:31.000 --> 53:35.800]  numbers every group is going the same direction I even say in groups because
[53:35.800 --> 53:39.760]  everybody's just intermarrying it's all a bunch of bull man now there's another
[53:39.760 --> 53:43.880]  clip where they try to derive a racial narrative out of this you already heard
[53:43.880 --> 53:47.240]  her was it appropriate he kept directly addressing the African-American
[53:47.240 --> 53:52.640]  community I thought that's what you want Obama wouldn't come to your
[53:52.640 --> 53:56.800]  communities he just spew a bunch of race garbage and go on shows and say whites
[53:56.800 --> 54:02.560]  are more racist than ever the ones that are elected him creating racism on both
[54:02.560 --> 54:05.960]  sides so here's the next clip
[54:11.960 --> 54:15.800]  no it doesn't concern me we're talking about this today we're not gonna talk
[54:15.800 --> 54:19.440]  about that we're talking about this this is what we're talking about our focus is
[54:19.440 --> 54:23.600]  right here for a minute notice Trump's going out and getting the people that
[54:23.600 --> 54:26.960]  will actually get the job done one of the best salesman in the world works in
[54:26.960 --> 54:29.360]  more countries anybody Rex tell us and you say he's bad say he's good the
[54:29.360 --> 54:32.720]  point is he's gonna get stuff done he's going out and putting people in place
[54:32.720 --> 54:39.520]  that have the biggest and best credentials to deliver it it's like in
[54:39.520 --> 54:43.520]  the NFL you put in the slot whoever's the best player no matter what color they
[54:43.520 --> 54:48.680]  are it's the same deal do you want the jobs delivered you want to see see the
[54:48.680 --> 54:52.640]  Democrats will appoint some black faces and then your unemployment doubles and
[54:52.640 --> 54:57.440]  he won't come visit you it's all image over substance Trump doesn't care how
[54:57.440 --> 55:05.240]  he looks he's going to deliver quote you will not be disappointed you want to be
[55:05.240 --> 55:11.080]  delivered or do you want to get more bull by the way Pastor Manning has been a
[55:11.080 --> 55:15.800]  big fan of Trump now thinks he's the worst thing since herpes so he's popping
[55:15.800 --> 55:19.320]  in the day I like Manning but I got to hear this because management says some
[55:19.320 --> 55:23.080]  really goofy stuff like he literally says if you're gay that fire will shoot
[55:23.080 --> 55:27.320]  out like a torch a blow torch out of your rear end so he observes he goes I
[55:27.320 --> 55:32.040]  will shoot out of them I love him to death but he's just something else he
[55:32.040 --> 55:35.760]  calls Obama the long-legged mac daddy I want to hear his new nickname for Trump
[55:35.760 --> 55:42.000]  I love me and he's something else I tell you I don't know what's going on with him
[55:42.000 --> 55:47.200]  though let's finish up the club and implement in this program
[55:47.600 --> 55:52.400]  what how do you help hope to use your platform you know as famous athletes
[55:52.400 --> 55:57.040]  commentator to carry this message out there and also hold the administration
[55:57.040 --> 56:03.000]  to their word one thing one of the things that it's no secret that you know if
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.280]  Mr. Brown picks it Papa Brown picks up a phone call and calls anybody in the
[56:07.280 --> 56:11.400]  nation right now who's in the world of athletics entertainment that phone call
[56:11.400 --> 56:15.480]  is easily picked up and so for myself the moment he picked it up for me years
[56:15.480 --> 56:19.960]  ago is the reason why I stand beside him right now with every every vision he's
[56:19.960 --> 56:24.560]  put forth now I'm he's he's passed the torch to me to carry that now and that's
[56:24.560 --> 56:28.240]  what I want to make sure we carry but to reach anybody there's nobody we can't
[56:28.240 --> 56:32.200]  reach and I think that's that's why we're here because we can bring a lot of
[56:32.200 --> 56:38.400]  people to work together and we're not here because of politics we are here to
[56:38.400 --> 56:43.960]  help the president of the United States help the people that need him exactly so
[56:43.960 --> 56:47.800]  to fight with each other I mean I know I know I know Dr. Constable personally and
[56:47.800 --> 56:52.440]  I think he's an excellent choice for this right absolutely well I just well I
[56:52.440 --> 56:56.120]  just think that's one thing even Mr. President spoke about is that that's
[56:56.120 --> 56:59.880]  the things he can easily be educated on just like people go to classes and go
[56:59.880 --> 57:03.200]  to schools for everything I'm pretty sure Dr. Carlson could be caught up on
[57:03.200 --> 57:10.920]  housing very quickly yes yeah brilliant guy thank you guys thank you all have a
[57:10.920 --> 57:18.240]  good day all right so there you go there's Jim Brown actually trying to
[57:18.240 --> 57:23.280]  get investment in the black community while everybody else runs around just
[57:23.280 --> 57:26.400]  trying to create division so they give me the race pimps over everybody I didn't
[57:26.400 --> 57:29.120]  get to it this hour I got a bunch of guests coming up but I've got to get to
[57:29.120 --> 57:33.720]  it today the fake news list Watson put out last week dub tells with this new
[57:33.720 --> 57:37.960]  fake news graphic they've put out that's being passed around by MSM and as usual
[57:37.960 --> 57:41.840]  they won't say who made it because there's lawsuits connected to it saying
[57:41.840 --> 57:47.360]  somebody's illegitimate trying to shut them down on the business look they say
[57:47.360 --> 57:52.680]  they've got stuff here that they say is totally nonpartisan and totally
[57:52.680 --> 58:01.320]  trustworthy and they list NPR BBC the Washington Post New York Times NBC ABC
[58:01.320 --> 58:08.280]  AP and Reuters CNN USA Today I mean this is ridiculous CNN is one of the biggest
[58:08.280 --> 58:11.320]  liars the Washington Post is so deceptive it'll make your head spin
[58:11.320 --> 58:15.200]  turns out the CIA didn't say that it was a subgroup and the other agencies don't
[58:15.200 --> 58:20.800]  agree they said all 17 agencies can literally agree Russia stole the election
[58:20.800 --> 58:26.000]  the BBC state run and it's been caught the giant pedophile rings in it just
[58:26.000 --> 58:30.320]  like Penn State I mean you look at all these groups this is crazy open most
[58:30.320 --> 58:35.640]  untrustworthy Breitbart and even lower than that the lowest is in fours where
[58:35.640 --> 58:38.880]  the worst there is that means where the best there is you know an upside down

[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:07.880]  we have Steven Crowder who is obviously a big sensation the last decade fighting
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.240]  tyrants on the internet and I like to see him really organizing and launching
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:15.280]  his own network now it's it's exciting louder with Crowder.com as comedian
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:19.800]  radio host conservative and author former TV and movie star as well he still
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.240]  does that too but he's been shooting some videos out in the street really show
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:28.800]  the absurdity of what's going on we never aired on air the whole Turk young
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:33.600]  Turk parody he did with me so maybe we should choose one of those and play one
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.800]  of those coming up as well but he's gonna be joining us coming up the next
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:43.200]  segment speaking of fake news I mentioned this because it's impossible the
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:48.120]  way the ad sharing systems work with Google or any other platforms to stop
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:52.560]  fake news unless you get rid of it and I'm seriously considering getting rid of
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:58.400]  third-party advertising completely that's web based from Google and from
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:03.360]  others because as soon as you knock down one ad you don't like another one pops
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:07.760]  up and I told the story I showed you about a month ago an Amy Schumer
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:14.400]  article with her ugly chipmunks face up there saying Amy Schumer clarifies
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:20.000]  why she isn't leaving the US you go there it's a fake newspaper clipping to
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.240]  make it look real from 20 years ago with Trump saying I hate conservatives I
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:28.120]  hate everybody they're all dumb boy I'm a big liberal it's a fake quote at the
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.360]  end of the article she admits it's fake knowing 90% of people don't read at the
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:36.640]  end well I had to then go through and say take that out of our ad feed they
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.680]  just put more crap in there so the New York Times just caught caught in this
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:45.840]  the Daily Caller reports oh snap New York Times airs ad for fake news by a
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:50.920]  mistaken article decrying fake news and it's the same third-party advertising
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:55.360]  where they have a slot they control and it said Alec Baldwin was dead at 58 I
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:02.560]  mean he just it just it's out of control Keith Olberman says the election of
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:08.880]  Donald Trump is like the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor and that means war
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:13.400]  we are at war with Russia or perhaps more correctly we have lost a war with
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:17.520]  Russia without a battle we are the victims of a bloodless coup so far a
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:22.360]  bloodless coup Donald John Trump a man who to borrow a phrase from another
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:28.080]  December long ago will live in infamy some experts have compared this to Pearl
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:34.480]  Harbor overman posted this crazed rant around 20 times on his Twitter timeline
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:39.840]  where he went on to yell and scream that January 20th will be the end of the
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:44.880]  United States of America the nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.120]  and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:53.480]  scum or beholden to scum Russian scum and you can watch

[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.840]  first off I don't normally rip off other people in the Liberty Movement but
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.600]  imitations is the most sincere form of flattering it's actually a big plug for
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:40.440]  him I have sought out cook sets for camping like we have when I was a kid
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:43.840]  the blue with a little white speckles and I couldn't find them anymore I was in
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:48.520]  Big Bend last year and found some coffee cups and I bought like all they had at
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.480]  the little Big Bend shop out in the middle of nowhere by the Rio Grande
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:56.000]  River about like five of them look at this louder with Crowder I'm not kidding
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.520]  I told my crew a year ago I said I want to have coffee cups like this with info
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:05.400]  wars dot com on them now this guy's really weird okay I got it I had this
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:09.000]  weird idea myself talk about great minds thing alike and then he's beat me to it
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:15.160]  see crew see so I'm not ripping him off I'm I'm my my original idea is his too
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:18.440]  but no I mean we'll probably never get around to it I mean the point is he said
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:21.360]  it was hard to discover where to get him as well but look that you get that when
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:25.520]  you sign up to subscription service at ladder with Crowder dot com and we'll
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:29.480]  talk to him here in just a moment and the reason he's coming on is fake news and
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.120]  I want to just illustrate this for you we'll put it on screen from a video I
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:36.960]  did last month where I show the Amy Schumer article from all places I heart
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.840]  radio put this out and it says Amy Schumer you know explains why she's not
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.800]  leaving the US and she says oh I never really said that I didn't really mean it
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.880]  and then there's this quote of Trump saying I hate America I think they're
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:53.120]  all stupid we put it on full screen for folks to see it next day and at the
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:57.480]  bottom of the article she later admits by the way this quote isn't real so she
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.440]  knows most people don't read that far down they're doing this to me now like
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.440]  on pizza gate I go I don't know if Hillary's killing kids for real but I
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.640]  know that she funded ISIS and Al Qaeda so she's literally funding people that
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:14.040]  chop kids up they cut off the part where I say in Syria now the Washington Post said
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:18.360]  I was talking about Syria but NPR the local paper they don't be by family
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:22.240]  going are you really saying she chops kids up in a basement never said that
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.880]  never focused in on that play I talked about the pedestrian emails and the
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:30.520]  spirit cooking and weird crap this is how mainstream media deceives then they
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:35.240]  run all these ads this was run on info wars and Breitbart I saw it in the ad
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:39.440]  feeds you get from Google and other people so it's like whack-a-mole I'm
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.240]  almost every day telling my IT people okay contact them pull that ad out it's
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:49.560]  always some horrible bull or some lie about you know some conservative they
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:53.320]  know what they're doing so they're targeting us through our advertising
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:59.080]  while pulling BMW ads Kellogg's ads yes that's happened to us to you know
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:02.320]  Breitbart smart enough to point out what happens but they're doing it to us so
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.760]  this is how they operate now there's an article out today by the Daily Caller
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.480]  oh snap New York Times airs ad for fake news by mistake I mean there's four or
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:13.200]  five of these companies Google's the biggest one but there's a bunch of other
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:17.400]  content providers that they mix in articles with ads you get a share of it
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:22.040]  you you put a block of four or six you know pictures down at the bottom of your
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:26.800]  article that's third-party advertising with a slot with code to project what
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:31.120]  they want onto your websites like an authorized hack basically and what did
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.560]  they say here's a screenshot for TV viewers I'll scrub it for radio listeners
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:39.160]  Alec Baldwin is dead at 58 now mainstream media is so fake they may take
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:43.120]  this clip of me and have me saying that I'm not kidding they've reached that
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:46.960]  level of deception but here it is he was more of a legend than any other
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:51.680]  Hollywood and a lister he was found dead and it goes on so in the New York
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:56.760]  Times article about fake news they have a news feed with fake news this is real
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:02.720]  fake news every month they say I'm dead every month they say Mike Tyson is dead
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:06.800]  or we don't do this do we get things wrong sometimes yes so
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:11.400]  Crowders pointed out they've changed the YouTube algorithm to where if you don't
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:15.200]  do pure clickbait if you aren't totally mindless and sensational you don't get
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:20.200]  traffic if it's substantive then you're basically shut off you've got to be
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:23.560]  mindless you've got to be idiotic and he went and shot a video to illustrate it I
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.440]  want him to set it up first but it is mainstream media that's gone totally
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:30.880]  tabloid they're the ones that have dumbed it down they're the reason they've
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:36.080]  lost credibility not the Russians not Donald Trump not Stephen Crowder not
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.680]  Paul Watson not and culture and so they're so delusional though they think
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:46.480]  censoring us shadow banning us on Reddit blocking us in Google Chrome
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.120]  saying we're a fake website's gonna work I don't think it's gonna work so Stephen
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:55.480]  Crowder with louder with Crowder.com joins us what's your take on this well
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.440]  thanks for having me by the way there's plenty of blue speckled porcelain to go
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.440]  around so I appreciate you give me a heads up no no problem with that at all
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:05.120]  I probably won't even copy it it's just funny I had that idea that's a really
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:09.400]  cool idea what made you think of that I don't know we were looking at different
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.920]  mugs I wanted to do this I have a friend who runs art of manliness as a
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:15.880]  website and I wanted I just had this in my mind and it's been really hard so for
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.680]  people who've ordered them you know we're back orders like a six-week lead
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:23.080]  time so I'm sorry about that so it was a big hit I knew it it was thank you I
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:26.400]  appreciate it especially with with your support I'm very appreciative with the
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:30.560]  fake news YouTube just changes so people effectively have to subscribe twice I
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:34.000]  don't know if you've seen this effect your personal feed but even big youtubers
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.160]  like PewDiePie and I think Philip DeFranco have talked about this if you
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:40.440]  subscribe on YouTube that's not enough you then have to hit the bell and allow
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:43.960]  notifications well people are subscribing who don't understand this sort of
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.800]  inside baseball of the web they think they're going to get notifications
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.800]  that's what a subscription is so we did a video to do you guys have a clip of the
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:55.040]  video is that what I'm setting up we do yes okay so we did a video where YouTube
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.760]  isn't really aware that this is encouraging more clickbait it's
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:02.720]  inadvertently encouraging more fake news or certainly I would say news that's
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:07.680]  been exaggerated despite their best I noticed our subscriptions and stuff are
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:12.320]  not growing as fast and our views have been cut and probably 30% the last two
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:15.560]  weeks okay good well it's not just us them because a lot of youtubers have
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.880]  seen that and a good example is for you know we're going to have Sally Cohn on
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.480]  this week on my program well you're going to be in my program then we have
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:25.320]  Sally Cohn I don't know who else we may have another guest who's adversarial and
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.280]  here's the thing I don't agree with her I'll have someone on who I don't agree
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:30.720]  with at all but if someone doesn't click like because they don't like that
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:34.160]  person's opinion YouTube says you don't want to see this well no no no people do
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.800]  want to see the debate people do want to see discussions no I've noticed that some
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.520]  of my best videos are the ones that get all these dislikes because they think
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:43.960]  they're disliking the person right exactly so again people who go on to
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:47.160]  YouTube most of them they go on they want to watch videos and get off they're
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:50.440]  not commenting they're not liking and the reason this is important listeners is
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:54.480]  is we're huge on YouTube billions and billions of views yeah if you're not in
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:57.040]  the info or knowing this stuff that I don't even really understand I'm glad
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.800]  Stephen and Paul and my 14 year old son was actually telling me this two weeks
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:03.480]  ago his dad you got to click the bell it's the likes they change the algorithm
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:06.080]  I'm because I was wondering sitting there at the dinner table boy our YouTube's
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.880]  are down I wonder what's happening he explained to me because our other
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:11.880]  traffic's staying the same it's not just Christmas it's that this is happening so
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.040]  this is inside baseball folks but we're gonna win the info war we've got to talk
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.280]  about this yeah absolutely and that's what we created that you know all of our
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.880]  stuff and like you Alex what I do appreciate is you put a bunch of free
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:24.520]  stuff on YouTube and you have your premium membership we don't want to go
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.120]  off YouTube because like you said we want to fight the left where they are and
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.080]  that's why we've created the Mug Club and CRTV so that we can have free stuff
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:34.400]  on YouTube and if people want to support it they also can for a low price
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:38.160]  because we can't be beholden to people who want to silence this is how we're
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:41.360]  independent yeah exactly and you guys have obviously done a great job with it
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:45.320]  so if we're gonna do the clip this is dr. clickbait coaching people on how to
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:51.440]  create YouTube news that is palatable for most people Stephen I'm uplawing the
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.840]  new video
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:16:02.280]  I've never seen such a shameful display of you to worry what the doctor clickbait
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:06.280]  yes what are you doing here that's all wrong this kind of content will never
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:09.920]  make anyone's recommended feed our subscribers they love this kind it's
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:14.080]  not about subscribers original content anymore it's all the recommendations see
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.680]  that they are see what that thumbnail needs you know what that means
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:21.960]  that thumbnail requires dicks don't mind it scientifically proven that every thumbnail
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.680]  with dicks is a hundred and forty two percent more clickable and what's up with
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:30.440]  that title it's entirely wrong it's accurate borderline descriptive even
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:34.840]  you need to use words that create an adversarial nature bombastic words like
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:40.400]  fail epic rect or destroyed and never forget to mind the confirmation bias
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:43.800]  people want you to tell them what they really want to hear and what will you
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:47.520]  tell them exactly what they want to hear that's how you generate pics on YouTube
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.960]  that's how you make the recommended feed let me show you you need to use those of
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:57.520]  that picture what about image accuracy you need to clickbait that title whatever
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:02.280]  happened to it honesty oh everything about this is awful I guess it's not so
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:12.200]  easy to see you know where I just follow his hips it can be as easy as 1 2 3
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:18.240]  but dr. clickbait we don't even start but I'm so glad you asked you can find
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:23.320]  examples everywhere you simply have to look
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:31.600]  like here oh and there I get it like here and there and here it's all
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:39.840]  everywhere now you try okay like here no no no there oh like like here and here
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:18:00.080]  and there whoa I think I got it now thanks dr. clickbait wow so what we're
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.800]  doing here is we're trying to tell the fellow info warriors how to be more
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:07.760]  effective but I've noticed this that people like really clean serious titles
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.800]  is what we always did is breaking down what they're about to see but but now
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:14.440]  YouTube's saying no don't do that they're encouraging the garbage the
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:18.000]  mindlessness and I think you're saying it's on accident Stephen I think they
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.360]  want it dumbed down I think they want the fluff to dominate that's in the
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.400]  WikiLeaks that they want to keep us distracted and diverted I don't think
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:28.880]  they want content like yours and mine to be number one well I think I think
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.520]  there's a truth somewhere in the middle I think you're right obviously you're
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.800]  conservative leading channels have had all kinds of issues we have had people
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:38.560]  unsubscribe to us and auto subscribe to other channels by accident it's always
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:42.200]  hard to track I don't think they want false clickbait with all the breasts as
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.320]  we talk about though that's all over YouTube but I do think that they're
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:48.400]  getting rid of the subscription feed you know and enforcing this recommended
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:51.360]  feed because it does give them more control that's absolutely true and
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.360]  it's bitten them in the rear because now there are all these people who don't
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:57.440]  create any content and they're just putting up clickbait thumbnails and this
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.040]  is the problem you know listen it's great that there's there are no media
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:03.000]  gatekeepers you know this and I know this this is why we're allowed to have
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.400]  these careers we wouldn't be allowed to be on mainstream networks I know I was
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:10.840]  for a while and it didn't work out very well but the problem is then they have
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:14.880]  every person in a basement who's willing to lie and generate more clicks and
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:18.560]  that's that happens both on the left on the right the left is just more used to
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:21.640]  it because he used to have Brian Williams and Hillary Clinton doing it but
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:24.320]  now you have people on the right who I don't even want to say people right
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.000]  people who just see it as a business right this isn't about informing people
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.120]  or entertaining or enlightening there are people right now who say okay if I
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.800]  spend X amount of dollars and generate X amount of clicks I can be profitable
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:37.680]  but let's expand on this I mean let's expand because yeah obviously there's
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:41.520]  fake news with just websites that create a new URL every few months that sounds
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:45.600]  interesting and then they run fake stories just to get clicks I'm not even
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:50.040]  really advertising base maybe 25% of what we do I'm not even focused on trying
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:55.040]  to you know send people to you know advertisers we have advertisers that we
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.000]  believe in that we put up that are high quality products and so we have a beating
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.680]  down our door so I'm not even in the clickbait model I'm purely trying to use
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:05.840]  the web to communicate and educate people 7% of what we do is just direct
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:09.560]  sales now expanding on that we don't find a really good response with a YouTube
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:13.560]  or a Facebook audience with our products it is the AM and FM market of true
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:16.760]  conservatives and libertarians and people that actually support this
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:20.960]  operation they realize it's a mission to wake people up so again I'm pretty much
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:25.840]  at many levels not immune but almost immune to this stuff but it is designed
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:30.440]  to shut down other people out there who aren't which is most new free thinkers
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.840]  like you or Gavin McGinnis or countless you know countless others now you're
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.040]  innovating so obviously you're growing that's the way to defeat the tyranny
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:40.440]  defeat the censorship in my experience is just to get bigger and bigger because
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:45.480]  big fish eat little fish but separately the pure fake news that's there versus
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:49.040]  the mainline corporate leftist news that is the most dishonest there is out
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:53.160]  there yeah they have no credibility obviously they're desperate attempt now
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:57.760]  after imploding with the election is to come out define the new universe and try
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:02.720]  to ban all of us as the EU is calling for and we're seeing the censorship we're
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:06.960]  seeing the filters being applied so your thoughts on that and how do we counter it
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:10.720]  well you know it's funny because this could be an era with Donald Trump or
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:15.360]  like I'm optimistically skeptical I'm glad with some cabinet picks not so much
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.560]  others but I hope that we readdress the net neutrality issue because that was
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:21.600]  one the wall was pulled over a lot of people's eyes they didn't exactly know
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:25.440]  what was going on there and there's been a backdoor into like you said with the
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:28.680]  EU with people who do want to silence voices of dissent and all they need to
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:32.680]  do Alex's file it as hate speech or say that it's fake news there is fake news I
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:36.440]  understand a business responsibility of fiduciary duty to shareholders right to
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:39.560]  get rid of actual fake news for example like I don't know Hillary Clinton eats
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:42.800]  children in a public park well yeah that's fake but someone who has an
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:46.840]  unpopular opinion shouldn't be banned and the problem is it's really hard to
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:49.920]  delineate especially when you have a bunch of sprites in Silicon Valley
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:53.840]  sitting together in one big giant agreement fest to say well we don't like
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:57.400]  this person to their point of view and that's a real problem so you know I
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:00.720]  said you're immune that's why we're building up this network and the mug
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:04.440]  club as you talked about we're trying to branch out more because yeah we're on a
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:08.080]  few stations actually with with your network there GCN I think one of dozen
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:12.640]  stations but most of our viewership comes from podcasts come from comes from
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:15.720]  YouTube younger people you know we're in the young Turks backyard and I learned
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:19.080]  that the hard way when we talked about this because we did a sketch right it's
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.960]  so funny they've had millions of plays parodying the young sketch out and I
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:25.880]  think this is indicative of someone's character the young Turks used to slam
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:28.960]  me all the time when we were a small channel under a hundred thousand
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:32.440]  subscribers now we have hundreds of millions of views and we're making fun
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:36.920]  of them actively and they never address it they ask us to stop making fun of them
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:40.120]  and get our own fans what about when we were a little guy all you did was stomp
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:43.560]  on us then you punched down and you're seeing that from the left and they don't
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:47.160]  like being bullied back and it's a real right and it gets worse than that I
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.640]  mean I haven't had to go back to this but it was one of the biggest things from
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:53.920]  the RNC viral we walked by it's all crowded in this media row it's a
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:57.760]  converted parking garage with with plastic walls up with air conditioners
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:02.440]  and it's just we currently walked with so much media they wave us over we say
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:06.720]  yeah we'll be back yeah I saw my jump dawn hey how's everybody going they blew
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:11.360]  up lied about it all and then I walk over after we leave an hour later and
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:15.800]  everybody's calling going your live video feed that you'd posted to YouTube we
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:20.240]  went live has been deleted and it didn't say by user didn't say by YouTube just
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:24.240]  gone I go on air and say you better put it back up and they did put it back up
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:27.720]  yours was deleted from your channel yes they were actually they were actually at
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:34.080]  the YouTube platform YouTube was running their show so somebody outside of their
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:38.760]  rights with them was deleting our videos I mean that shows the control they've
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:42.120]  got well even idea when YouTube started right I was on there did this video the
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:45.080]  Quran challenge where I read verses from the Quran and to the three studios
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.960]  routine as Mohammed beating up my six-year-old wife by the way if you
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:50.720]  don't want death threats don't do that kind of thing anyone out there it's
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:54.040]  just a small recommendation this thing got millions of plays this is early on
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:58.160]  in YouTube and it was so auto flagged and was put on these Mujahideen blog spots
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:01.640]  this was in 2009 this was actually how I met Andrew Breitbart by the way because
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:05.680]  he saw how this thing blew up and what happened was they would flag it flag it
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:08.640]  flag it and there was an auto system in YouTube or it would be removed so this
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:12.760]  video was removed for half the time because angry Islamists would go in
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:17.360]  flag it as hate speech or they put like 50,000 comments to try and bury other
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:21.040]  comments repeat repeat comment so any comments critical of Islam and I remember
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:25.960]  this is true 100% I won't give the name but it was one of the big four cable
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:30.000]  networks Andrew Breitbart put me in touch with them and I told him about this I
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.800]  told him what was happening the censorship the threats they said okay Kate if
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:38.120]  you die it's a story click and hung up and that was my rude awakening into the
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:43.560]  world of traditional media well where do you think all this is going because I
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:46.400]  can't think of a major newspaper that hasn't had one of their writers call
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:50.720]  for Trump to be murdered there are you know Facebook's with hundreds of
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:53.720]  thousands of likes saying kill him Hollywood directors are trying to
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:57.680]  organize his murder nothing's being done I mean where do you see all this going
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:01.720]  because I've seen the left go from being quirky and kind of insane they're
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:05.720]  completely vicious foaming at the mouth we've got Newsweek saying you know a
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:09.800]  case for rioting was the headline meanwhile they're claiming that Donald
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:12.960]  Trump in a headline people are gonna die because of Donald Trump was the
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:17.160]  headline because he mildly criticized a union head that said he didn't bring
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:21.560]  enough jobs back to Indiana he tweeted back at the guy so they said quote
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:25.040]  Donald Trump's gonna get somebody killed so they keep branding it that our
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:29.160]  speech is gonna kill somebody when I'm not calling for violence you're not
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:32.920]  calling for it I mean these people are crazy well first of all I don't know
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.280]  about people who are actively plotting to get Donald Trump killed I haven't read
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:39.080]  about that but I do know the other things that you're talking about and this
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:42.080]  is one thing you know I talked about yeah there been like a silicon executives
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:45.400]  and others saying I want to organize his murder and Hollywood people saying
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.520]  let's get him killed and and in New York Times columnist saying he needs to be
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:51.000]  murdered well then they're not very good at it because they should make some
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.040]  private phone calls and not put it in a column but they have been vitriolic and
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:58.480]  I will say this you know I had a commentary on this last week with
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:01.760]  Donald Trump and the unions you know this was one issue that I have with Donald
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:05.280]  Trump where he was talking about bringing jobs back but he didn't explicitly say
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:09.000]  and we're not going to punish companies who are trying to escape the unions and
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.920]  so a lot of union voters and union representatives voted for Donald Trump
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:15.480]  thinking it was a kickback to them they're never going to be his friends I
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:20.480]  hope he realizes that I agree what is their problem to come out call him a
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:24.520]  liar and bad Chuck Jones the head of the union when when Trump brought back 85
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.520]  percent of the jobs well here's the thing it's like the UA and that's what
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:30.720]  really bothered me with Michigan Michigan voted for Trump some people and I spoke
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:34.240]  with Union Rep saying well he's gonna make sure that Ford stays here and that's
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:37.800]  good for the UAW well hold on a second the UAW two out of three every workers
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:41.840]  aren't working you're paid three four times as much as American workers for
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:46.200]  Honda Toyota Nissan they they make tons of cars in the United States I was in
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:49.560]  so listen I want Donald Trump to encourage people to keep business in
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:53.400]  America but I also don't want them to punish people for trying to leave a
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.280]  state you know that's a great that's a great point because here's what's gonna
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:00.120]  happen now that they think he's fully backing them they're gonna shake down the
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:03.840]  automakers worse yeah exactly and they're never going to play nice with
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:07.360]  Donald Trump and I know I've spoken with some people who have made it a part of
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.600]  a strategy just privately we they're like well listen the Rust Belt the unions
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:14.040]  we can get them a lot of these white blue collar workers white Americans I get
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:17.920]  it but there needs to be the realization you need to call these people out and
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:20.880]  you need to make sure the companies understand I know but that's my point
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:25.320]  is barely called the guy out and said you couldn't even keep the jobs and then
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:28.880]  they called it a death threat in the Washington Post they implied that he's
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:32.360]  gonna get people killed because he disagrees with him I mean this is this
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:35.840]  is a new standard of claiming we're violent right and that's why I think
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:39.160]  Donald Trump should just continually call them out and be even less less
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:42.800]  merciful with them because listen and you know this all too well in the unions
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.960]  the Michigan particularly Hoffa they're basically mobsters but as far as sorry
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:51.120]  going back to the news issue I think it's a kind of what I'm doing and
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:54.440]  obviously what you're doing and what other sites are doing people need to
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:58.880]  accept that there aren't going to be nearly as many giant mega sites or
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:02.240]  billionaires but they're going to be far more hundred thousandaires or
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:05.480]  millionaires people can have their own digital plot of land people can have
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:08.680]  their own website and make a good living but not if you have a classic
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:11.880]  corporate cost structure and I've watched a lot of these cable networks I've
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:15.160]  watched them try to work and do their stuff online and they're just applying a
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:19.600]  cable news model online exactly what we exactly what's gonna happen is you're
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:23.880]  gonna have thousands and thousands of really great truly diverse choices and
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:28.240]  and real journalism and and people in every corner of the country every
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:33.480]  sector every angle every niche being covered that's the future is an entire
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:39.440]  pantheon of choices not the big giant dinosaurs they're over and would you
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:45.480]  agree though this election signals the final collapse of MSM I don't know if
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.320]  it signals the file I think it's certainly coming and I think one thing
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:51.640]  that people need to accept is that will also come with crap so for example right
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:54.200]  you have cable what do you have you have thousands of choices right before you
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:57.960]  had only a few networks so what do you get we get breaking bad you get walking
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:02.800]  dead but you also get Hallmark Christmas films so you get some fantastic content
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:06.080]  and you also get some crap that'll always be profitable for a certain gosh I
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:09.520]  hope I'll Hallmark film Christmas films are not a sponsor to anyone are they I
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:13.120]  apologize if that's the case but the point remains that's going to happen
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:16.640]  online I think they're gonna put my film America again on there the greatest
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:21.800]  film ever made they're gonna put it right next to a Candace Cameron hey dear Santa
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:24.600]  film and then that is actually where it's gonna air no listen I get what
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:28.000]  you're saying listen Stephen Crowder thank you for coming on they're doing an
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.520]  amazing job and with your permission I am gonna rip off your cup I'm joking hey

[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:49.480]  Nichols about the latest on what's happening from his connections we're
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:57.720]  on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:06.000]  Keith Oberman says the election of Donald Trump is like the Japanese bombing
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.920]  Pearl Harbor and that means war we are at war with Russia or perhaps more
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:15.360]  correctly we have lost a war with Russia without a battle we are the
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:20.680]  victims of a bloodless coup so far a bloodless coup Donald John Trump a man
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:25.560]  who to borrow a phrase from another December long ago will live in infamy
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:30.680]  some experts have compared this to Pearl Harbor Oberman posted this crazed
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:36.480]  rant around 20 times on his Twitter timeline where he went on to yell and
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:42.200]  scream that January 20th will be the end of the United States of America the
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:46.720]  nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread and the military apparatus of
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:51.880]  this country is about to be handed over to scum or beholden to scum Russian

[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:37.840]  with Trump he liked Trump and now now he's calling revelation Trump so I don't
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:42.160]  know what's going on with Manning he's really a entertaining guy smart guy too
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:45.880]  but he's put out some of the most unintentional comedy I've ever seen
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:49.800]  lately I can't play it here on there but I mean there's some viral memes online
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.800]  with Manning that are just it's it's it's like if I'm down or something I got
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:58.480]  to do some midnight interview and I had a cup of coffee and gonna work I don't
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:01.320]  even drink anymore sometimes I don't be on beer or something to wake me up
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:04.200]  in the middle of the night you know it's a depression or it's a stimulant but I
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:09.040]  just have like one beer now I'll just watch Manning us turn give us this is a
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:18.200]  theory on blow torches but he's going to be joining us ever seen I'm tempted to
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:24.040]  play there but it's a family audience so that's coming up yeah I shouldn't be
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:27.840]  laughing there's it's such a serious time to be alive right now I want to walk
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:32.280]  through the Electoral College because the 19th we're talking five days away
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:36.600]  they supposedly vote and then on the 6th they're supposed to have them in and
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:39.760]  and start announcing what happened with it and then I guess they're gonna have
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:43.200]  some big debate in Congress we'll go over all those numbers a Nancy Pelosi's
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:48.400]  daughter and a Democrat PR firm run by the Clintons are the ones behind this
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:53.360]  and they got the CIA involved even though the other major defense agencies
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:58.280]  say that no they're not concurring with it and I've talked to folks in the CIA and
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:01.160]  they say this is not the main CIA doing it's why they're saying it's a secret
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:06.120]  report people like you know people in the CIA that's all Hollywood the CIA is a
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:11.080]  big deal it's bigger than Coca-Cola it's all over the place when Jesse Ventura
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:14.200]  got elected governor the first week they said so folks like to meet with you in
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:18.120]  the basement of the Capitol there was 25 CIA people in there they look like
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:21.720]  little old ladies you name it all it is it's just a shadow government and it's
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:27.800]  disgraceful to be involved with it especially today so be a break I am so
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:31.680]  proud that we're organic and original and and just came out of the soil of
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:37.200]  Texas that's what's powerful what's organic what's real what's truth-based
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:40.800]  not a bunch of Ivy League kids snot noses wanting to think they're better
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:45.800]  than everybody so all CIA and all these movies about the CIA and the rock is in
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.600]  the CIA and he's cool and this couple keep up with the Joneses their CIA and
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:54.520]  they're cool hell whole anyways old Larry take about the CIA not a very good
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:59.440]  group not a very good organization now before I go any further here briefly my
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:05.800]  dad is a dentist I retired an oral surgeon and a chemist and we set about
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:10.280]  for two years when I about a year after I started in fours life to try to come up
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:15.200]  with a toothpaste and a colloidal silver in it and it was just really hard to get
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:18.240]  it in there and keep it in nano form and we also thought about doing an iodine my
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:21.760]  dad said let me work with the big companies and he did this took him a
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:26.040]  year he even came up with the name and the graphic he came up with a DNA force
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:30.880]  as well and it's super blue we're gonna have a new graphic soon people don't
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:35.220]  like the graphic my dad made it it's kind of real simple fluoride free
[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:38.640]  toothpaste it's made by the folks that make the the most popular brand in the
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:41.080]  country but when you sign these third-party agreements to manufacture
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:43.520]  you know they obviously don't want you to use the brand name so I'm just gonna
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:47.800]  leave it at that no I'm not gonna break the contract rules but let's just say
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:51.360]  this is the highest quality there is nobody's got this with iodine and
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:57.480]  silver and peppermint and tea tree oil it's amazing and it comes out of the
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:01.400]  tube white and it turns blue when it oxidizes that's the real color blue
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:07.360]  purple of true iodine not red bound iodine you don't absorb most of it
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:11.440]  that's what's red that's the stuff you drink the stuff from you know the story
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:17.640]  will kill you this is true iodine and I thought would take us months to sell out
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:20.160]  how much my dad ordered I said you just do whatever you want dad because he's
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:25.800]  involved with our supplement company and boom this is amazing we've already

[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:46.560]  let's just just just tweet it out my name on my Twitter real Alex Jones saying
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:56.640]  more unintentional comedy from state-run media and it says the trusted
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:01.680]  non-partisan media is the New York Times the Washington Post BBC and NPR
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:06.160]  because that's all basically state-run NPR BBC or officially state-run it's
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:09.000]  come out in the WikiLeaks the New York Times is run by the Democrats and
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.440]  George Soros so is the Washington Post I mean this is hilarious the most
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:18.280]  trusted in the bullseye but you could just invert this and you know on the
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:21.600]  bottom have state-run media and on the top of independent media doesn't mean
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.560]  independence perfect but this is ridiculous look at this they have over
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:30.280]  the right-hand side right wing and the worst quote utter garbage that's a nice
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:36.920]  scientific word conservative conspiracy theories info wars is the lowest in the
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:44.760]  area of hyperpartisan becks the worst I am the worst total right Barton X
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.720]  worst daily caller next so that shows how the White House who they really hate
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:53.480]  I am so proud to be listed as the absolute worst disinformation out there
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:58.120]  which tells you it's the opposite we're the best info told you Trump was gonna
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:01.200]  win told you Hillary try to steal it but our guest told you that Hillary
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:05.120]  wouldn't give up and we go out for the electors he was on the week after the
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:10.320]  election four weeks ago and now Larry Nichols Clinton Chronicles guy admitted
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:13.120]  and you know guy behind him running for governor wouldn't go along with them
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:17.080]  killing kids and Mina Arkansas and the drugs being flown in former Green Beret
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:21.840]  he's here to give us his breakdown and from his sources but he was calling two
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:24.160]  weeks ago guy they're going after the electors watch it's gonna get bad I go
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:27.000]  look I know well now people were laughing about this down they're not
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.880]  laughing this is this is amazing we've got some new developments there all go
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:34.320]  over as well Larry Nichols is our guest Larry well a lot's happened since we
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:38.840]  talked four weeks ago you bet excuse me for not getting dressed up for the
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:46.920]  occasion but I didn't today listen Alex there are 38 electoral votes that if
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:54.520]  they flip Trump's not president Hillary is and as you know Nancy Pelosi's
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:59.640]  daughter announced that they've got 30 of the electors that want the
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:04.880]  confidential CIA intelligence files about Russia now don't you love that the
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:09.280]  CIA or rogue element of it is gonna quote go right to the electors that's
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:15.360]  translated a CIA coup of the popular vote the states right right listen y'all
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:21.480]  that means literally translated they've got 30 that are just looking for some
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:27.680]  social excuse justification excuse to flip their vote cover they're looking for
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:35.280]  cover that's right now that means there are eight left when those eight go and
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:40.600]  I'm not so sure they don't have them I was warned this morning I told you this
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:47.800]  morning I got a call from somebody inside the new attorney
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:54.560]  prosecutors office that pointed out that this is going on big time they have
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:43:00.640]  uncovered a major major serious movement they call it a plot you're saying
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:06.680]  you got a call from sessions office from his office from the new one yes and I
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:12.760]  talked to him did not talk to him but I talked to one of his hirelings that's
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:17.480]  gonna be an hourling as a matter of fact the inquire got the same lead on the
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:21.800]  19th they're coming out with a story about it however that's the 19th a little
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:29.160]  bit too late so yeah it's coming Alex Hillary Soros and them you've known it
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:34.880]  for years they're the largest criminal organization in the history of the world
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:41.600]  and they are that close to having our country when if they have our country
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:46.720]  they've got the world you think they're gonna walk away when all they got to do
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:54.720]  is get 38 of these electors to flip their vote and legally the electors can do
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:59.200]  it and Larry I just had them I just had them for TV viewers the crew punch up
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:03.680]  the background to dark blood red because you know we get so close to this
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:06.880]  crisis we get so close to evil we get kind of comfortable with it even though
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:09.800]  we don't like it and I'm sitting here look at the tea leaves I had a bad
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:13.800]  feeling on election night and Roger Stone said man it's 3 a.m. celebrate and I
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:17.280]  said no they're gonna try to kill him they're gonna take the electors they're
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:21.240]  gonna start a war they're gonna do a false flag I know them this upsets their
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:24.520]  whole operation because Trump's a nationalist he's not perfectly a
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:28.880]  nationalist and and I know them they're not gonna give up and now when I saw
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:32.280]  Soros the next week double the amount of money a black lives matter meaning
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:35.480]  doubling the amount of money to civil insurrection and then cops are to get
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:38.760]  and killed almost every day shot in the back of the head it shows they're
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:43.440]  warming up the civil war and then CNN said Monday and again yesterday we want
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:47.600]  a national emergency first they said oh Trump's causing one then they said we
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:52.080]  need Obama to declare one and not let Trump get in they're officially running
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:56.400]  a coup with the CIA in front of us this is like having the mafia go to a
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:00.000]  grand jury and tell them they better vote different this is unbelievable I
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.080]  mean I can't believe they're this bold Larry Larry I'll tell you something though
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:08.720]  I kind of welcome this because they are jumping the shark I mean they are jumping
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:11.560]  a 10 trillion pound shark brother and you know that didn't go too well for
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:16.320]  Ponzi I mean that these people are nuts I mean if they really try this I always
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:19.600]  said let them steal it get Hillary in it's probably better for the awakening I
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:25.960]  mean I think these people are nuts I they're crazy Alex they're not trying
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:31.200]  they're doing it please y'all hear me so you're saying you're saying they are
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:34.800]  in handy okay then let's break this down what's because I've got the dates but
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:37.880]  they're saying it's nebulous is between the 19th and the 6th when they finally
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:43.000]  announced the votes how do you expect this to be rolled out we'll know on the
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.920]  20th that they flipped it to Trump or to Hillary we'll know they might keep it
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:53.280]  secret to kind of get start over and say that again cuz I'm gonna take I want to
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:56.640]  take this clip in a YouTube and Facebook video have you at the front say that and
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:59.400]  then come back I mean say that because I was interrupting you what's what's you
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:03.160]  you're saying it's already happening what's happening it's happening here's
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:08.960]  what they're doing on the 19th they're gonna have 38 of the electoral college
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:14.720]  members that were dutifully supposed to vote for Trump however legally they are
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:20.640]  free to vote their will they are gonna flip their votes and on the 19th Donald
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:25.960]  Trump will no longer be president we won't hear about it officially until the
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:30.840]  6th but you'll hear about it before then they'll start laying the cover in the
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:35.200]  groundwork right after the 19th when they're certain they've got those votes
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:40.000]  in their hands they'll start laying the cover in the groundwork of what to do in
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.800]  case there's pushback now I'm telling guys please hear me you know I told you
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:49.280]  they were gonna do this how could I've known Alex right after the election this
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:56.560]  was coming they're not going to walk away from the powerful position that they
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:47:01.320]  have worked all their lives for that this criminal organization has spent
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:07.960]  years trying to get they finally get it in place they finally get the media in
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:12.120]  exactly the place they want them they finally believe it or not get the
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:16.640]  American people in the place they want them to wear okay so you catching us
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:23.360]  lying so what there's nothing you can do about it that's where we are Alex who
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:30.920]  can you call the day after if this is done successfully who are you gonna call
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:35.480]  no one well that's why they've gotten rid of any real journalists and have got
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:39.000]  the green light for media that's proven they'll lie they'll cheat they'll steal
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.360]  my friend they are taking clips of me now on totally separate subjects and
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:48.840]  editing it together with other quotes I've made and putting on NPR and then
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:53.320]  that's picked up and put newspapers I say Hillary's responsible personally for
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:56.760]  running al Qaeda and ISIS they killed hundreds of thousands of people thousands
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:01.360]  of kids chopped up murdered rape killed they cut that together and say I say
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:05.960]  Hillary's raping kids in the bottom of a pizzeria the I've never seen the press
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:11.360]  go to that level of deception Alex did you get my warning this morning that
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:18.160]  person from the Attorney General to be office gave me another little warning
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:23.600]  Alex if they pull this off you're number one on the list you're gonna be gone buddy
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:31.680]  info wars will be toast you have been successful at getting first in line
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:38.120]  attention from Hillary now remember when they say fake news when Hillary comes
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:42.840]  out saying this fake news is running the risk by the way they're gonna come at
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:48.840]  you with inciting riots inciting anarchy that's if they're gonna come at
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:52.200]  you they're gonna come at you I think they're coming all of us I guess you're
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:55.920]  gonna blame the other side to steal it from Trump that's right that's right
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:03.160]  now what the Clintons do since the day I was with them and I helped design this
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:09.480]  system so I know it so well what you always do is you accuse your enemy of
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:14.280]  exactly what you're doing sure just like she got money from the Chinese and the
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:17.640]  Saudi Arabians publicly they bragged about it then she just turns it around
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:20.280]  she got money from the Russians then she turns it around and blames it on
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:25.280]  Trump exactly now you figured out for yourself do you think when Donald Trump's
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:28.800]  out there talking about how he's gonna arm up our military make it the greatest
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:32.640]  military on earth how he's gonna get tough in negotiating you really think
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:39.200]  Putin would rather have Trump than Hillary get real get real never happened never
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:44.760]  happened I'm telling you they are coming they're coming and they're planning to
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:50.240]  take this election and they know just like I do and just like you do Alex if
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:55.200]  they don't if they don't their powers going forever well that's why is there
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:58.440]  backs against the wall and they don't believe Trump when he says oh I'm gonna
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:02.240]  leave you alone now they think he's going to go after me putting sessions in
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:06.120]  what do we do though the military and police are pretty much awake what are
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:10.680]  our ace in the hole cards here I mean we got a discredit the fact that these
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:15.080]  electors are being run by the Clintons and this is racketeering well you got
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:19.800]  to remember this folks 80 to 85 percent of all the electors in this country
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:25.440]  belong either to the national Democratic Party or the state Democratic Party
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:30.320]  from which they come so now you've got a favorable crowd of people just sitting
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:35.280]  there you also know that they're gonna claim hey she won the popular vote now
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:39.960]  we find out Russia was involved we've got plenty of reason to challenge
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:44.720]  Trump being president people that we want a new election or maybe just will
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:47.960]  they just install Hillary and have her have convulsions in front of everyone
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:52.640]  no it'll just be announced Alex it'll just be announced and then they've got
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:57.080]  to shut down all the time then they've got to go to full tyranny though that's
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:01.320]  right that's why I'm telling you and was getting the warning that you're top on

[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:10.480]  about five years ago when a trainer told me it was the end all of protein
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:15.640]  powder one day when I ran out I decided to try other brands I spent eight months
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:19.720]  and could not find a replacement I went through tons of brands tight and
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:24.520]  flavors and almost all of them tasted unnatural and not pleasant when it all
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:29.800]  boiled down I came right back to one world way I buy the cost-effective five

[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:16.080]  they're talking about NPR CNN the Daily Show saying things about Sandy Hook out
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:19.560]  of context I haven't said saying things about a pizza gate and all the rest of
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:22.160]  this trying to say I'm gonna cause violence they're also saying in the
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:25.320]  Washington Post Donald Trump's gonna get people killed the headline because he
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:30.000]  sent a tweet back to the Union saying I brought back 85% of the jobs you
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.480]  couldn't keep them what's your problem oh my god you're gonna cause riots Donald
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:37.160]  Trump you're gonna cause a national emergency CNN saying Trump's gonna
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:41.360]  cause a national emergency the next day they call for Obama to bring in a
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:45.360]  national emergency and then Larry Nichols and I know he's got some of these
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.880]  sources I've talked to the inquirer and others they go yeah he's one of our main
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:50.600]  sources and I talked to people in Congress I say yeah no we know Nichols
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:54.640]  for decades he says he's talking to one of sessions senior people today and they
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:58.040]  were telling him we'll go ahead and repeat it all for folks right now you
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:03.480]  bet Alex what they're gonna come at you for right now or very soon Nancy Pelosi
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:10.320]  is trying to find two congressmen Democratic Congressmen to bring suit
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:14.960]  against you immediately I do not know if she has them yet but she's doing it and
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:23.120]  she's gonna sue you or they're gonna sue you for inciting Lord my mind just went
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:26.600]  blank but basically it's not a civil insurrection is what you told me
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:31.600]  civil unrest civil unrest that's what they're coming at you for and then the
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:36.560]  purpose is to get you in federal court and they'll have a federal judge that
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:41.280]  the minute it hits court they will suspend your operation until it can be
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:45.880]  adjudicated and that's what they're planning for you and God knows what
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:50.240]  they're planning for you if she gets to be president and her people take over
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:55.040]  it's not gonna be pretty Alice look if anybody doesn't want to believe any of
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:56:02.040]  this good God just look just look are you telling me the mainstream media Alex
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:07.440]  is not gonna touch the fact that there are electors right now regardless how
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:12.080]  many there are electors right now willing to flip their vote and vote for
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:17.680]  Trump but you see ABC NBC and CBS talk about it no no they're just saying
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:21.680]  Trump's a Russian Trump's a Russian Alex Jones Russian Tucker Carlson's a
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:25.200]  Russian that level of rhetoric is incredible and it's what they are saying
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:29.160]  it's the right thing to do to flip their votes and have a new election this is
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:31.720]  we're bringing brought into martial law and I want to explain to them all the
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:35.340]  rest of media out there if they're able to shut info wars down because we're so
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:38.480]  effective they know we reached tens of millions people a day now they could
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:42.200]  shut everybody else down next just as Matt Drudge came here last year and told
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:47.480]  us he was told by Supreme Court Justice by 2016 they plan to shut it down if
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:52.720]  Hillary won she said we're gonna shut down the alt right but listen under
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:57.160]  the first under the First Amendment under common law under all of this unless
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:01.960]  they bring in full martial law which CNN's calling for they won't be able to
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:05.800]  shut us down and have prior restraint the way the law works is malice of fore
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:08.680]  thought intent to do harm I'm not calling for violence I don't have a
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:11.480]  history of violence they try to connect me to things they're the ones that lie
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:15.640]  about WMD's launch huge wards it's newsweek and time that have said stuff
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:19.400]  like it's time to riot their writers say kill Donald Trump they're saying the
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:23.200]  same things about me that you're saying privately publicly already brother and
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:28.440]  they're saying about Trump so I've told Trump and and and other people have he
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:32.360]  needs to get on the offense now so let's talk about that because by the way put
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:35.920]  me in this briar patch I mean this is legendary like the king of England
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:40.000]  coming after John Hancock and George Washington and Thomas Jefferson I mean
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.920]  there I mean because look they're already saying shut me up and they're
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:47.040]  already saying shut up Trump so it just shows what absolute scum these people
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:53.000]  are this I mean I could not be given a greater medal my friend well think about
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.480]  this Alex do you believe it's accidental that Hillary went to Washington for
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:05.240]  whoever's getting rid of what's his name the Senate leader Harry read read you
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:10.000]  think it's odd that she would go and she would talk about fake news and how it's
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.840]  killing people in that a weird no that's all there Obama said it in five
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:19.760]  countries yeah he said we gotta shut it down he said state-run media to Rolling
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:23.000]  Stone no I know it look it's clear they're making a move
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.400]  Trump's the counter could has just put the country back on live support they
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:29.360]  know we're kicking the hell out of them and they don't know how media works if
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:36.640]  they shut me down it's like Darth Vader cutting down Obi-Wan Kenobi
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:45.680]  hold on I got one minute man I'm excited this is great news yeah forcing
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:50.920]  them right out in the open there falls them in it I want to tell you about a

[02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:32.120]  all right Larry Nichols is our guest another guest coming in at the next
[02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:36.560]  segment you know what he's saying I know he has these sources but I could see it
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:39.320]  the news they're calling for shutting us down they misrepresent what we say what
[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:43.640]  we do it's all covered under the First Amendment you know they say I see nobody
[02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:47.600]  died at Sandy Hook what I said is answer Cooper turns we've shown and his nose
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:51.320]  disappears it's a blue screen or green screen and seeing has been caught
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:53.840]  saying they're in the field but they're not during the Iraq war the first one
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:56.960]  and then they've got cars driving while they're interviewing Nancy Grayson
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:00.480]  another lady and you see the same car driving behind him in a circle it's all
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:04.840]  fake now I don't know when I say all fake the broadcast star I don't know if
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:08.560]  people died there or not I know there's real mass shootings they go well he said
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:11.800]  it didn't happen he's gonna cause death you're the ones causing death running
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:16.680]  around I'm covered but it shows you're going for broke then I cover what's in
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:19.760]  the weird Podesta emails and Eric Prince comes out says he has sources that it's
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:23.080]  pedophilia and you got Clinton caught you know on the lead express and all this
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:26.640]  pedophilia crap going on and then they just change the subject because it's
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:30.400]  about pizza codes there's some pizza place the Podesta goes to and then say
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:33.480]  that I'm saying all this when it came from Reddit and everywhere and then say
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:37.160]  oh look he's backpedaling no I'm not I'm not saying that people at that pizza
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:40.040]  place are doing anything we covered internet investigation then they say oh
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:43.880]  a guy I went in there with a gun so you gotta take Alex Jones off the year good
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:49.040]  luck good luck you're gonna take us to the next level they've miscalculated
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:52.000]  just like they failed and tried to steal it from Trump and it blew up in their
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.280]  face it's the same thing we've got Providence and this is how tyrants end
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:00.400]  up falling this is history but Trump needs to get out on the offensive as
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:04.240]  well because they're calling for banning the president off of Twitter saying he's
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:08.040]  a quote bully they're shooting high folks they're shooting at me they're shooting
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:12.160]  in him this is big this is dangerous Larry you were talking during the break
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:15.800]  you said the way to expose this is sunshine expose their plan they'll have
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:20.720]  to crawl back in their rat hole so so what do folks do if you want proof of
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:24.760]  this there's a reason they're not talking about flipping votes on the main
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:29.920]  street on the mainstream news there's a reason because it would make people
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:35.480]  rise up so I'm telling you every one of you out there now you start spreading
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:41.080]  the word don't make yourself look crazy just tell the facts tell the facts 28
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:44.920]  states the lecturers can vote anyway they won't do regardless of the popular
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:51.400]  vote tell the facts they've said it Nancy Pelosi's daughter's got 30 that won't
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:55.160]  the synchrony intelligence by the way that's now in the news and let me just
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:59.200]  add here because you're absolutely right notice they didn't try to announce the
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:01.880]  day that Trump won they were gonna try to steal because everybody was awake they
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:06.280]  get angry they wage when Christmas came everybody was happy we went to sleep now
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:10.200]  they're making their move we've got to raise the alarm got a raise the alarm
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:15.360]  people you've got to wake up these people cannot function when the light is
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:19.240]  exposed to them that's why they hate them for wars and Alex Jones that's why
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:23.720]  they hate the people like drugs that do come out and give you the whole story
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:29.160]  listen spread the word spread the word that's what they're trying to do hey
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:33.840]  listen Alex the word how do you think Trump got elected everybody was told
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:38.080]  Trump couldn't win Trump couldn't win it was your audience and other people
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:42.280]  throughout this country that went out and said no that's all I he can win the
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:47.200]  polls are a lie and you know what they did and it was just because drudge it's
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:50.160]  more correct than anybody because he would put up whenever they were having
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:54.920]  voterless victories for Ted Cruz it was just that image that defeated them and
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:59.480]  and then he even came out and said it's lies like that on drudge drudges be
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:04.440]  pretty good it's lies like that is why I'm losing no you had a voterless victory
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:08.000]  so again they can't have right mark they can't have info they can't have drudge
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.520]  and folks we've got it but as you said don't you think exposing them will force
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:15.520]  them to back off I mean they're they're bold yes they've got to go to full
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:21.040]  martial law to shut me up listen if if we expose it and people are aware of it
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:25.840]  and they know people by the millions are aware of it now all of a sudden they're
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:29.720]  not going to be quite as bold on the legal remedies that we might have then
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:36.520]  return look if this is a conspiracy which you know it is and they do this to
[02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:41.520]  steal this election under false and liable's pretense then yeah that's a

[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:25.440]  news articles it's got to be 5,000 I get the Google alert sometimes it's a
[02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:29.720]  thousand a day usually it's a couple hundred five more than 5,000 just lying
[02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:33.040]  taking quotes out of context I'm talking about Syria and Hillary being
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:36.240]  responsible for kids getting raped murdered and cut up they say I'm talking
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:42.920]  about some pizza place I mean you next level deception and they're doing it to
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:47.040]  Trump putting up quotes reheats people and saying it's true and then they later
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:54.880]  admit it's not true it's next level deception and now in colleges they're
[02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:58.560]  saying don't even say holiday that's politically incorrect because somebody
[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:01.800]  might not have a holiday in their religion or their group Wonder Woman's
[02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:07.360]  band because she's quote attractive and white at the UN this is a cult and the
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:11.880]  Republican establishments against Trump the Democratic establishments against
[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:17.760]  Trump and Pastor Manning who I really like he's a funny guy and he's smart my
[02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:21.520]  smart he always has great angles on things he's becoming on the show I
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:24.880]  know six seven years something or maybe eight years I don't know he's got OTTLA
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:28.680]  good church there in Harlem helping folks and he's gone up against bad guys
[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:34.300]  like Al Sharpton he's also got some of the just funniest rants I've ever seen
[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:37.280]  we might play women it's not quite family oriented I guess he is a pastor
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:43.000]  maybe he can approve it for us but the fire clip because maybe we're getting
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:51.120]  repeated for it's live on air but he joins us OTTLAH.org but but he hadn't
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:55.760]  been on a few weeks and I said hey let's get him back on and I've been able to
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:57.720]  follow what he's doing lately because I've been real busy like everybody else
[02:09:57.720 --> 02:10:02.880]  has and his secretary goes now now Pastor Manning doesn't like Trump now he
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:06.720]  need to check that out he's throwing him on I said yeah I'm sure I don't know
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:09.640]  exactly what he's saying because I again I've been so busy because they're trying
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:12.160]  to steal the election right now whether you love Trump or hate him they're trying
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:15.840]  to get the electors to flip right now Hillary's all convulsing all over the
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:22.240]  place saying banned fake news Obama's on TV and in speeches and and in in the
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:26.800]  Rolling Stone last week saying we need to shut down the fake news and of course
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:32.840]  I'm the chief supposed fake news I mean what's fake all I do is sit here and show
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:36.420]  you what I'm talking about I mean the mainstream media is putting out this
[02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:40.480]  graph showing fake news they say BBC the Washington Post of New York Times are
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:48.080]  totally nonpartisan bi-partisan with no bias and are totally truthful that is
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:53.480]  the most ridiculous crap we have WikiLeaks the Washington Post NPR all
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:59.160]  these people directing the lies so I mean this is just ridiculous what's fake
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:02.800]  news now I have my own cutting analysis and I have guests on they don't
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:07.320]  control what we say and they hate it so they're trying to overturn the Trump
[02:11:07.320 --> 02:11:10.560]  election and I'm manning met with Trump said he liked Trump we're gonna find
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:13.320]  out right now I didn't like Trump because I want to get folks on that you
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:17.520]  know to keep us honest here and I don't like some of these appointments Trump's
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:20.960]  done I like some of them and have you go sideways once he gets in then try to get
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:24.280]  this initiative done then try to bring the jobs back I'm gonna be mad but so far
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:27.880]  lots of jobs coming back Japanese 50 billion investment 10 billion steel
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:34.000]  mills carrier coming back Ford plants coming back another big company came
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:40.000]  out and announced IBM 25 25,000 more workers it goes on and on so let's find
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:44.720]  out from Pastor Manning exactly what's going on from right there in Harlem
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:49.840]  New York City so Pastor Manning first off I really liked that purple shirt
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:55.600]  that's sharp thank you sir I like it too I wore it just for you just for your
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:59.560]  brother they're gonna say it's a secret code though that you're part of the
[02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:04.520]  Hillary purple revolution it's code well you know I'm not a part of Hillary
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:09.280]  anything unless it's a doggie remove her like her sister what's going on with
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:12.600]  Trump well you know I you know I haven't been on the broadcast for a couple of
[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:16.680]  months I thought I would be responsible and respectful of you when I withdrew my
[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:22.040]  support from Trump I didn't want to come on your broadcast and slam him while
[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:26.360]  you're in full support of him you have to remember I supported Trump perhaps
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:31.120]  even before you did I think you were with Ted Cruz for quite some time I jumped
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:36.360]  on the Trump bandwagon fact we wrote that song the Trump train that came out
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:39.720]  of our ministry one of our members wrote it and one of our members performed it
[02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:46.800]  so when I recognized that Trump had made some commitments to me and our group
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:52.840]  when we were with him at Trump Tower going back over a year ago and I felt
[02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:56.360]  with those kinds of commitments I'd go ahead and stick my head out and endorse
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:13:01.000]  a politician something I'd never done before Alex I'd never endorse any
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  politician previously but I was encouraged by what Trump said I have
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:11.320]  some really really kind and exalting if you will worries to say about him but
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:16.680]  shortly after he made those commitments to me and to our group of what it was at
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:23.040]  the time were black pastors if you will and others he walked all that back in
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:26.880]  fact he's demonstrated emphatically that he had no intentions of keeping a
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:31.640]  commitment he made to us well then I felt not obligated to keep keep my
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:34.600]  commitment to him okay well let's talk about those commitments things I don't
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:37.800]  I mean I don't know about any of this and just to be clear up front I was
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:41.520]  probably more of a Rand Paul supporter and a Cruz guy I didn't really know
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:45.400]  Trump but early on when they started really hating Trump and going after him
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:49.000]  that's why I started really look into him so I'd say I was a Trump supporter
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.240]  pretty much from the beginning of the campaign but I mean I think your statement
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:55.160]  overall is correct that I was a Cruz fan till he started stabbing folks in the
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:14:01.840]  back please go ahead yeah and so to enumerate the promises that made that
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:06.320]  Trump made one was is that it was expressed in that meeting of some 85
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:11.200]  pastors that day that we were concerned about the issue of same-sex marriage
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:16.360]  that had been forged by the long-legged Mac Daddy Obama and the Supreme
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:21.640]  Court had gone ahead and acquiesced illegally ordering all states to
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:26.880]  perform same-sex marriages under penalty of law with that case coming out of
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:32.120]  Ohio well we have said that we didn't want our churches to be intimidated or
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:36.360]  pastors who believed the Word of God to have to submit themselves to the
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:40.120]  authority of the Supreme Court when we had already submitted ourselves to the
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:43.360]  authority of all so what did Trump do because I'll say this is one of the real
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:47.320]  criticisms conservatives could have is what he said about be nice to LGBT and
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:51.760]  all that during his nomination speech in Cleveland the other stuff but he is
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:56.040]  appointing folks that are saying states rights and so he has to kind of left
[02:14:56.040 --> 02:15:00.560]  bashing him on you know of that side of the situation but he has said he wants
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:04.360]  to get a bill in to have the IRS leave churches alone and and let them be
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:08.280]  independent again well Alex you know you know me for eight years I've been
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:12.840]  coming on your broadcasts for eight years and thank God for that the but the
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:16.240]  IRS they've never tried to tell me what to say and they better not because they
[02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:20.960]  go work and ain't what happened but going back to what Trump did and what
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:26.560]  calls me to take back my endorsement was that he demonstrated emphatically and
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:31.040]  said about the Kim Davis event who was arrested for refusing to issue a
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:35.760]  marriage license to men there in Kentucky when Trump was just asked about
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:41.280]  that question he said that Kim Davis ought to obey the law it's the law of
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:46.080]  the land obey it when Bruce Jenner was at his building he was asked by a
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:52.120]  reporter would Bruce Jenna be allowed to use any bathroom within his facility
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:56.560]  male or female he said Bruce Jenna could use any bathroom he want I'm a pastor of
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:00.760]  a church we have a school we got little girls we got women my wife and mothers
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:05.120]  go into bathroom I just don't want a man going in the back for sure the left is
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:08.240]  calling for urinals be put in women's bathrooms they want to end the gender
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:11.720]  roles scramble all together they make it like we hate somebody we don't know I
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:15.920]  mean I get it but I always told I always told leftist this I said listen
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:19.520]  you're all mad at him and all this made-up stuff that he's this big right
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:24.120]  winger when in a lot of ways he's liberal my issue with Trump is he does want to
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:29.800]  break globalism and bring jobs back I see your point as a Christian that he is
[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:34.280]  pretty darn liberal on some things and I think that's a legitimate issue and it's
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:37.480]  actually a real conservative criticism of Trump that's what I'm really sick of
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:42.160]  with the left though you know I you know I somebody's gonna find the statement I
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:46.560]  made about Trump what I said he was understanding patient and and why
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:50.480]  sometimes gonna find that and play that and sticking in my face because I said
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:55.240]  it but here what I'm saying is is that he's not out to get us he just tries to
[02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:59.320]  be nice to everybody and I know I can see what you know you can't do that but
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:03.360]  let me let me complete this I what happened was I withdrew my support and
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:08.320]  I was I was good with that you know I stood before the church I had to humbly
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:13.600]  eat crow and and tell a congregation that I've led for 35 years here in Harlem
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:17.960]  that I'm withdrawing my support okay I got past that but then I started getting
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:22.280]  attacked like they attacked you on issues and you know how they come at us
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:27.640]  and I'm open I know that this I dish it out I expected to come back but when
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:30.880]  they started attacking me I had to start defending myself and that's when I
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:35.560]  started dropping down heavy on Trump and pointing out some obvious things that
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:38.400]  people were saying that just weren't I mean I think I mean I think I mean I
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:41.480]  think it is real opposition is what needs to be heard to keep him on the
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:44.560]  straight and narrow he's got people around him pushing him in a certain
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:48.480]  direction particularly obviously his daughter people who are great folks but
[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:51.040]  that's where that liberalism is coming from it was his daughter and others that
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:54.760]  convinced him to go nice in the first debate and that Hillary was gonna be
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:59.920]  nice she set him up he figured it out you know show I just don't think Trump's
[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:04.520]  evil but go ahead go ahead I mean it tells what you think about Trump here
[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:10.960]  my position is now after having taken back my endorsement and watched his
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:16.640]  maneuvering as a politician to gain the nomination and then from there to win
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:20.960]  the election which I don't think that he necessarily thought that he was going to
[02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:28.320]  win I have watched him and I discussed early today he very well may be made to
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:33.720]  order businessman real estate developer deal maker par excellent we probably
[02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:39.240]  never see in it body or anything like him but I think that he possesses a group
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:46.040]  of talents and also fallacies and flaws that are extraordinarily glaring when it
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:51.800]  comes to the well-being of a nation of which he is now being called to leave
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:56.640]  for instance I agree I think his daughter and others convinced him to go
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:01.040]  liberal I believe also that Trump is a New York liberal like Ted Cruz said I
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:05.200]  don't think he's a conservative I don't think he has a conservative bone but I
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:12.160]  think in his body but I think that he has some potentials and some flaws that
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:19.120]  are deadly with respect to a nation and also to the people that gave their
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:22.840]  lives and support of him and one case in point and I'll stop talking for a
[02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:27.720]  moment for seven eight years Alex I was on your broadcast talking about the fact
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:32.480]  that Barack Hussein or the long-legged Mac Daddy Obama the quasi Muslim freak
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:36.760]  was not eligible to be the president of the United States of America okay and
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:43.280]  having done so in Harlem New York the most recognized place I gotta do this
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:46.960]  hard break we're gonna come back and see where you're going with this but look
[02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:50.520]  all I know is Hillary's trying to steal the election right now we could be
[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:54.200]  dealing with Hillary Clinton my gut tells me Trump wants prosperity that's
[02:19:54.200 --> 02:20:00.560]  why the elite Haiti and we need as patriots to let our voice be heard what

[02:24:04.280 --> 02:24:08.920]  Pastor Manning you know I like you and I know you're smart guys so I like to have
[02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:12.360]  people on who actually do really disagree with Trump on some real issues and I've
[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:16.520]  just said all along it is that he's too liberal on social issues is the only real
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:20.120]  criticism I could have so again it's only has legitimate criticisms I'll
[02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:24.040]  hear it I go out at anti-Trump rallies there's a bunch of people the rainbow
[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:28.800]  flag screaming he wants to kill gay people and it's like no he doesn't and
[02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:32.920]  they just don't care about the truth he wants to kill Mexicans he wants to
[02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:36.920]  deport black people to Africa but if you look at some of the liberal background
[02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:40.600]  that's real but then what's made the elite so scared of him that's not a put
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:44.160]  on there they're trying to get the electors right now to flip they may do
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:48.200]  it they're talking about civil war all the rest of it to keep them out of
[02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:52.280]  office so why is the Pope and the communist Chinese the Saudi Arabians
[02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:56.040]  dumping in money against him why are they claiming he works for the Ruskies
[02:24:56.040 --> 02:25:00.600]  again I agree with you on the liberal stuff you're right but but I mean still
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:04.640]  why is the enemy so against him Pastor Manning well I can tell you this they
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:11.840]  may try to undo the election they've got two chances of doing that both slim and
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:18.960]  none it ain't gonna happen it would be totally unprecedented in our American
[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:24.200]  judicial system and legal so is Obamacare Obamacare is a foreign tax yeah but
[02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:27.760]  they're not gonna do it Trump is gonna he's gonna walk into the oval office
[02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:32.400]  under whatever circumstances he walk in but there are people even people that
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:35.640]  are gonna ask you this question my gut told me when he won that night they're
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:39.440]  not gonna let him get in or they're gonna die trying I've never my gut tells
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:43.360]  me that they're gonna try to stop him and what does your gut tell you well you
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:48.440]  know I felt the same thing quite frankly Alex when I say something like that on
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:51.800]  the air I get visits from the FBI you know that they're gonna kill the
[02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:57.240]  president so I'll let you say it you know and see what they do with you but you
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:02.120]  know I think he's gonna walk in but there's a long way between now and
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:06.520]  January 20th I can tell you that right now but I'm not in favor of overturning
[02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:10.320]  the election I don't think we should I think the election was one whether by
[02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:14.400]  hook or crook I'm not so sure I got all that confidence in our voting in the
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:19.320]  electoral system anyway but he wanted he got it let him walk in but I think that
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:21.720]  one of the things I want to say to your listeners your audience people cuz they
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:25.120]  may not have caught this it may not understand him you understand the
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:30.000]  liberal aspect I'm a pastor I built my life on the word of God now I
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.120]  understand you want prosperity you want people to be doing good at the same time
[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:37.320]  you've got problems with the fact you're liberal I want people living in
[02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:42.080]  mansions here but I cannot abdicate the strength of the word of God but I think
[02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:45.840]  what is happening of recent and some of your listeners may have problems with is
[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:50.800]  that people have viciously attacked me when I withdraw my endorsement or when
[02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:54.000]  I pointed up some things that I thought that's not right I mean I mean here's the
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:57.560]  bill we can't just and and I can't I can't let people attack me without
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:01.960]  attacking back I ain't gonna I ain't gonna happen I got to defend my position
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:05.920]  well listen I'm not in some cult I mean look if Trump doesn't deliver on massive
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:09.800]  jobs and good Supreme Court appointments that's my litmus test I'm gonna go
[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:15.400]  Tasmanian devil politically as well but I'm gonna see if he delivers I mean
[02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:18.320]  look I get him trying to bring America together and I'm more liberal than you I
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:21.520]  guess socially I don't approve of what they're doing with kids how they're
[02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:25.040]  targeting people but I don't hate folks at the same time but I do love God but
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:27.680]  I'm not a preacher like you are so I gotta say I'm not as pious and I mean
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:32.280]  that respectfully but I mean Hillary Clinton if he just delivers an
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:37.600]  anti-globalist message that shuts down their program right there you know I
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:43.400]  think that it's important for us to understand that nobody wanted Hillary
[02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:48.320]  not even black people they didn't want it because Obama big like a little boy
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:53.200]  trying to get a date with a girl for prom to get Hillary in they rejected
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:58.360]  them and it's a firm rejection and not only that Alex but it's a rejection on
[02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:03.440]  his eight years of failed policy as a president sure so what do you make of
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:07.080]  him so far though he really is asking corporations to move into the inner city
[02:28:07.080 --> 02:28:09.880]  areas he's actually making those phone calls they've CEOs have come out and
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:13.880]  said that's what he says in the calls well you know I'd have to verify look
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:18.880]  closely at at where he's going to get the workforce to do that I you the
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:22.520]  inner city the biggest one is Harlem, New York right now we're not ready for
[02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:26.160]  manufacturing on the obviously he brings it in close then that brings in
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:29.520]  people maybe even from outside that brings money into the area it brings
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:33.520]  investors you know they've tried that with gentrification they've tried it in
[02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:39.240]  New York Washington Philadelphia Detroit and other places and it has failed it
[02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:44.720]  just isn't I mean you're gonna listen you Germans have a certain kind of a
[02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:50.800]  mindset of perfection therefore Cisco systems and other corporations in
[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:55.920]  Germany tend to get a really good worker rule people in America and the
[02:28:55.920 --> 02:29:00.880]  hinterlands outside of this urban areas tend to be better workers than sub
[02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:04.880]  than then some then urban work yeah I don't care if they're black or white
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:09.960]  something about multi generations in the city turning the late dumbasses yeah it
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:12.960]  doesn't it doesn't you don't get the best type of worker coming from the city
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:16.880]  and you're right black or white is not the issue on this so I don't see that as
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:21.320]  being a prosperous move I don't see that working at all but I do think it's
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:26.280]  important Alex that we look at who Trump is filling the swamp listen I'm gonna

[02:30:07.840 --> 02:30:13.040]  means war we are at war with Russia or perhaps more correctly we have lost a
[02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:17.320]  war with Russia without a battle we are the victims of a bloodless coup so far

[02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:32.240]  government and outside the government trust me I've been around 25 years but
[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:39.320]  on there almost 22 I guess it's April of this year I've been around 21 years this
[02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:43.000]  April coming up and that's like three months away four months away between two
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:48.080]  years and they know I'm for real and you know I'm not somebody that just follows
[02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:53.600]  a politician I saw the elite genuinely hate Trump and go after him because they
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:56.880]  didn't know whether he was just gonna take over their operation or really
[02:33:56.880 --> 02:34:02.240]  overturn it and right now I see mixed signals but just the rhetoric he put
[02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:06.480]  out and and the global awakening against the New World Order and the
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:10.840]  corporate system is devastating it's it's you judge a tree by its fruits and
[02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:14.760]  rhetorically and and and what Trump's already done and what we've done has
[02:34:14.760 --> 02:34:19.360]  shaken the world I mean the the elite are in panic mode so I've got to wait and
[02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:26.280]  see attitude and I see some really good things I see some bad things but that's
[02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:30.600]  said I see stuff 50 times worse I'm not a lesser or two evils guy but I see
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:37.240]  Hillary stampeding forward to steal the election clearly they're all over the
[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:43.840]  news op-ed saying kill Trump nobody gets in trouble so something's big my gut
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:47.640]  tells me my spirit that this it's it's like I thought I was on the edge of my
[02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:51.720]  seat a month and a half ago and I told you Trump was gonna win now I'm just
[02:34:51.720 --> 02:34:57.920]  like whoa and we're about to manning her in a minute I just want you know it's

[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:13.640]  lets me know how much danger we're all in I'm not a coward I'll think about this
[02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:18.920]  is me I think about it as man this is crazy before we go any further we are

[02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:21.480]  and tea tree oil amazing new toothpaste at info or store.com it's the best
[02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:25.320]  toothpaste I've ever used I couldn't get it developed in two years my dad said
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:29.240]  buddy real just let me handle it even did the graphics which are kind of
[02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:33.200]  retro but actually everybody likes it I guess I'll leave it the same so I thought
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:35.360]  it'd take a month to sell out of this we're gonna sell out in the next few
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:38.840]  days so thank you for your support but it costs us like four dollars a tube we're
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:42.400]  selling for 995 I know normal toothpaste it costs four dollars a tube it's hard
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:46.520]  to get the nano silver and the iodine they got to do it big industrial level so
[02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:49.280]  we did order quite a bit of it because I thought this would last months like I
[02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:53.920]  said so we'll get your reviews of that our other products at m4slife.com get

[02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:13.520]  Pastor Manning. Pastor Manning I'm gonna just try to shut up give you the floor
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:16.800]  here for about seven eight nine minutes so I actually haven't even lunch yet I'm
[02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:20.120]  gonna sit here and have some tortilla soup while you speak my friends to go
[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:24.640]  ahead. Thank you Alex and thanks so very much for allowing me this this platform
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:30.480]  there are a couple of things about the cabinet picks that that Trump has made
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:35.800]  I'm referring to him as tribulation Trump a biblical phrase one is Dr. Ben
[02:37:35.800 --> 02:37:42.760]  Carson who during the length and breadth of the campaign really warned the hearts
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:49.400]  of many Christians by promoting a ghetto story that either he tried to stab his
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:55.040]  friend with a knife and the knife accidentally or miraculously broke and
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:58.760]  the others that he was going to hit his mother in the head with a hammer now
[02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:02.040]  you're not been around the hood for a while I grew up in the hood I you know
[02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:06.280]  we do a lot of things we have said a lot of things about our parents but nobody
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:08.880]  but nobody ever thinks about hitting their mother in the head with a hammer
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:13.240]  unless you are psychologically pathologically deranged and no one
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:17.440]  would admit it even if you thought about it and of course this is what he
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:23.160]  said to get himself before the limelight of the people for tribulation Trump to
[02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:27.600]  now appoint him as the head of the Housing Urban Development Corporation
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:32.600]  an agency of our nation which he has never lived in public housing it bothers
[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:37.800]  me it looks like a token appointment which has been done a thousand times by
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:42.320]  every other president that has ever sat in the office all over office they always
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:48.480]  have token appointments however my problem is with this one is that it when
[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:54.560]  when when his I guess business manager Armstrong Williams of Ben Carson said
[02:38:54.560 --> 02:39:00.480]  that he was not eligible to or did not have the skills to run a federal agency
[02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:03.680]  when he was offered something in the medical field because he's alleged to be
[02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:07.880]  a brilliant surgeon he turned that down and he takes up Housing Urban
[02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:13.040]  Development unless me it makes me think there's something is going on that is
[02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:16.120]  not what do you mean alleged I mean he developed a lot of surgeries he was
[02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:22.480]  done before ever ran for office as a top innovator yeah I know however I say
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:26.680]  alleged because I want to go back to the fact he doesn't act very bright in other
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:31.760]  ways he may be a tremendous surgeon I'm sending conjoined twins nobody else has
[02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:37.200]  ever done it but when anything else he seems to be deficit of any other kind
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:42.640]  of integrity or personality my other concern is Steve Mnuchin who worked for
[02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:48.920]  Goldman Sachs who was a Wall Street boy who is a uber billionaire who doesn't
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:54.240]  know the cut the touch of a common man who has been in money all of his life
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:39:59.120]  and will continue to be in money all of his life right now his name Steve
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:04.880]  Mnuchin will be written on every every piece of money that America has that's
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:09.800]  made out of paper he'll be in charge of the entire treasury I'm just sick and
[02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:15.360]  tired of Wall Street always calling the shots regarding our financial situation
[02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:20.320]  and and and tribulation Trump said he was going to drain the swamp get rid of
[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:25.880]  Goldman Sachs Hillary Clinton took $250,000 on several occasions for 20
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:30.680]  minute speeches from Goldman Sachs they said nothing a third grader could have
[02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:34.520]  written a better speech than what Hillary gave but they wanted to buy influence
[02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:40.320]  with her and damn it they got Steve Mnuchin is now running the treasury
[02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:45.480]  every penny every dollar that goes through the American system the IRS and
[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:52.400]  everything else is not governed by a Goldman Sachs employee I cannot I cannot
[02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:56.480]  be comfortable with that I cannot believe that Tribulation Trump did not know
[02:40:56.480 --> 02:41:00.920]  that was absolutely back slap on his promise and also a back slap in the
[02:41:00.920 --> 02:41:07.040]  face of the people you're pausing so I'll jump in I'm taking a wait and see on
[02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:11.600]  this and I'll tell you why I've had probably I can't even count them all up
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:16.280]  I can think of five or six managing directors from Goldman Sachs that had
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:20.880]  up whole divisions that are actually anti-New World Order know me Prince many
[02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:26.560]  others they're fighting anybody who's anybody because Goldman Sachs basically
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:30.880]  runs the world has been a little sex you look at people they're appointing to
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:37.280]  be presidents in places like Italy they are former Goldman Sachs directors so
[02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:43.360]  when you look at this I get what you're saying but it's almost like that's what
[02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:47.240]  runs it all and if you go into Mnuchin that you're mentioning he's the guy that
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:51.840]  was anti-naftin gap he has a different strategy about a making it an American
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:56.360]  world so I would say he's not a globalist he's an American imperialist
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:41:59.920]  which I'm not endorsing an American Empire but Mnuchin is an American
[02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:04.120]  imperialist which I will take I'm not endorsing imperialism but our ideas
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:09.000]  America being great globalists want to sell us out they want us poor that's in
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:12.560]  their admissions of flowered in heaven it's in their admissions of their plan
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:17.160]  he wants to stick it to China who's been screwing us over not the Chinese people
[02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:22.960]  but the elites there just here's the deal I know people that know Rex Tillerson
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:26.720]  before he was anybody you're back when he was in you know mid-level engineer I
[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:30.200]  got a lot of family in Texas that have been engineers you name it he came from
[02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:35.520]  nowhere okay because he was such a good salesman and he started in the 1970s as
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:40.280]  a low-level you know in the field oil well engineer to the head of because he's
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:44.240]  such a good salesman he took standard oil away from the Rockefellers they try
[02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:48.400]  to take it back from him in 2006 when he was funding all the anti-global warming
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:51.320]  stuff which we wouldn't even have defeated them if it wasn't for him he
[02:42:51.320 --> 02:42:57.040]  exposed it was really a Ken Lay and Enron and a scam then they almost removed
[02:42:57.040 --> 02:43:01.160]  him so he had to then play politics and say okay I'm for it but notice it didn't
[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:05.400]  happen the new the the new guy he's got over EPA former Attorney General
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:11.640]  Oklahoma totally against it exposes it as a fraud so I we're gonna see what
[02:43:11.640 --> 02:43:15.320]  happens I'll tell you Trump's being very Machiavelli against them at least
[02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:19.160]  that's what I'm reading if he gets in and doesn't do that then we know we've
[02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:23.160]  got a problem but you know those two individuals come from those powerful
[02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:29.320]  systems but I have not gone along with it like the others here here is my final
[02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:35.000]  concern and I'll give you back your microphone that that is is that Trump
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:40.960]  made a promise to me I took a photo with him I shook his hand and I Alex there
[02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:45.600]  were a group of pastors in that room that for more than an hour and 15 minutes
[02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:50.280]  talked about nothing but getting Trump to apologize to the Black Lives Matter
[02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:54.400]  group because somebody tried to disrupt one of his campaigns early on and
[02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:58.680]  Trump said get him out of here and get him out of here now for an hour and 15
[02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:03.040]  minutes the bulk of those pastors in there argued that Trump should apologize
[02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:08.680]  I took the floor and defended Trump against all of those pastors and Trump
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:12.920]  don't apologize I told Michael Cohen don't let him later apologize backtrack
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:17.320]  and I told Trump don't ever apologize the Black Lives Matter it's a it's a
[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:22.760]  business it is a civil rights is a a character of a business at a college
[02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:26.760]  industry people make money off of the misery of other people but my point now
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:33.480]  is this is that there the what he did when he promised that he would be he
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:40.200]  would never forget us he would support us and our biblical causes that and our
[02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:45.320]  Christian beliefs and Christianity is shrinking like you won't believe globally
[02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:50.760]  but here in America when he backed up on that I look and I see all the people
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:55.320]  that I know that need jobs I have listeners all over America that are
[02:44:55.320 --> 02:45:00.640]  living on fixed incomes it is it's tough when you only get in a small check and
[02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:05.640]  that's that's dwindling and prices are going up I don't see I see him doing the
[02:45:05.640 --> 02:45:11.480]  same thing to the workers that that that zealously voted for him that he did for
[02:45:11.480 --> 02:45:16.080]  the preachers that zealously promoted him to help us keep the Bible alive and
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:20.040]  keep sure I think his argument is he's gonna get the feds off Christians I think
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:23.640]  his argument is gonna get the feds off Christians backs and and then let
[02:45:23.640 --> 02:45:28.280]  Christians you know do what they want and not be harassed yeah but you know
[02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:34.320]  this same-sex marriage thing is and then Obama has Obama has if the one thing
[02:45:34.320 --> 02:45:38.520]  he's done it's not all Obamacare the one thing he's done more than anything else
[02:45:38.520 --> 02:45:43.080]  is that he has pushed this same say this they are a children being
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:49.280]  indoctrinated age five in public schools and it's basically pedophilia absolutely
[02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:57.480]  and and Alice this is just flat out wrong for any humane society and to to
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:02.920]  promote and for the government to come in and enforce this doubt because they've
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:05.920]  got the power they've got Hollywood they've got I think it's important to be
[02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:10.560]  evangelicals like Jerry Falwell Jr. and others now that Trump's won or at least
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:15.560]  once it gets in to to hold his feet to the fire and to say hey you said this
[02:46:15.560 --> 02:46:19.300]  you said that let's see it and believe me when I've talked to Trump all I've
[02:46:19.300 --> 02:46:23.200]  done is is is told him look you got to prosecute Hillary she's gonna come after
[02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:27.120]  you and we really need you to you know help with the family and this attack on
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:32.200]  it and Trump says no I'm gonna do that and you know by the way you know not to
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:35.760]  suck up anything but you know I did a piece of gate thing I several people
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:40.160]  sent me to Pete's gate issue I have some listeners that listen to you more
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:43.160]  faithful than listen to me I'm jealous because every time I turn around they
[02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:49.440]  listen to you but and so they understood but they'll tell you and I did I and I
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:53.680]  knew that you had been a part of getting that message out I never once
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:58.120]  criticize you and Alex I'll tell you I mean I do criticize a lot of people but
[02:46:58.120 --> 02:47:03.560]  I've never once criticized you because I found you to be genuine if you believe
[02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:07.680]  something you believe it if you have to be you know removed from those beliefs
[02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:11.920]  you do that as well and I think that's made you a tremendous success I told
[02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:15.760]  our staff before I came on the air here I said Alex Jones wouldn't have me on
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:20.080]  Alex's media they're not gonna have me on 60 minutes but Alice is just as much
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:24.640]  media and CNN or I mean I want to hear legitimate criticism of Trump that's
[02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:29.280]  real not that he wants to kill the gays and it's the opposite I mean that's all
[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:33.360]  made up stuff what you're saying is legitimate I mean I know some people
[02:47:33.360 --> 02:47:35.840]  say the vitriol has been a little bit harder on your own show I mean look
[02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:38.840]  it's very entertaining can you get into the fire coming out of that and also you
[02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:42.480]  talk about how Michelle Obama looks just just just to humor me I love it can you
[02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:47.160]  just talk about that I did so many things only I call
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:52.640]  Michelle the fist bumper Obama and I said one point that you look like an
[02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:56.200]  orangutan I'm not sure exactly what which one those things I said so much
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:48:02.560]  about Michelle I think she looks like a man well you know that Michael is who
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:06.160]  she is no no she actually has the physique of a man what do you make of
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:09.280]  what do you make of John Rivers saying of course she's a man a trainee and then
[02:48:09.280 --> 02:48:13.400]  she was dead then the media says I'm lying and that I made that up all I did
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:16.760]  was quote what they said they call it fake news and I say John Rivers said
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:22.160]  that I can play the clip now no no no listen John Rivers died about 20 blocks
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:25.920]  from where I now sit here in New York City at a little lab over across over
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:32.960]  there off of Fifth Avenue she said that Michelle the was a tranny and a week
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:37.600]  later she was she was killed which and she was killed because of what she said
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:41.800]  because she was a powerful woman she is a woman she has a powerful audience a
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:46.640]  powerful voice and as a result of she she lost her life and so Alex the other
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:49.680]  reason why I pushed back so much against people pushing back against me
[02:48:49.680 --> 02:48:54.560]  because if I go to a dentist or a doctor or if I walk the streets of Harlem my
[02:48:54.560 --> 02:49:00.160]  life is always on the line and for Trump to have given up the birth certificate
[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:04.880]  things so easily and through all of us under the bus that were birthers that
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:09.640]  put me at Pescher Manning it's because we discovered that they duped us Michelle
[02:49:09.640 --> 02:49:14.520]  did say in speeches in 2006 that he was born in Kenya he did say in the
[02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:19.240]  Harvard Review is born Kenya on purpose to divert from his dad in Hawaii who
[02:49:19.240 --> 02:49:24.840]  was Marshall Davis I had a visit from the CIA back in 2000 I think at nine it
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:31.880]  was who gave me information that was irrefutable that Obama was not a
[02:49:31.880 --> 02:49:36.520]  natural born that he did not attend Columbia University I stuck my light
[02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:40.760]  my head out and conducted a trial that lasted an entire week people came from
[02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:44.520]  all over the nation to be a part of that trial because of what the CIA agent told
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:48.680]  me that Obama was not born so I mean there could be evidence they're also
[02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:52.880]  professional liars yeah it could be coming from all different let me just
[02:49:52.880 --> 02:49:58.240]  say this look look Trump's not perfect all I'm saying he's not Hillary he's got
[02:49:58.240 --> 02:50:01.440]  the globalist upset and angry don't be mad at Trump because some of his more
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:05.560]  zealots supporters have chewed into you but but I think it's I mean I think these
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:09.080]  are serious issues we should look at and that's why if you somebody's got
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:13.120]  legitimate things about Trump like David Knight's got some I say absolutely let's
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:16.920]  look at him all I'm saying is let's not make it everything we do because we're
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:21.120]  barely beating Hillary that wants five Supreme Court judges and our guns and
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:25.480]  wants to shut down the free press we know she's bad we know what she's gonna
[02:50:25.480 --> 02:50:30.040]  do 20-plus year history she's coming after me right now so I mean oh it's
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:33.800]  kind of a survival thing at one thing that we need to pay very careful
[02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:37.440]  attention to a hillar when she did make finally her concession speech she says
[02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:43.280]  something that startled me and that was we're gonna have a woman president a
[02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:48.240]  whole lot sooner than you think and she did that Hillary blinking of her eyes
[02:50:48.240 --> 02:50:53.000]  and shaking her head so there may be a massive plan oh yeah look at Michael
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:57.880]  Moore look at Michael Moore saying he's not I'm telling you there thank you

[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:16.640]  intelligence agencies have come out said no we didn't sign on to this no there's
[02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:20.920]  no real evidence there's no intent it's a very thin read that a quote the head of

[02:55:31.960 --> 02:55:34.440]  hearings where they admit it how the big foundations work how the state run
[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:39.680]  media works but we're gonna get to more of this tomorrow obviously I don't want
[02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:45.960]  to sit here and make the news about us but they're saying we are the number one
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:49.080]  enemy and I want to explain how this works I know most of you understand this
[02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:53.560]  if they can shut us down they can shut everything down but frankly I don't do
[02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:57.240]  this for fame or fortune or any of that I do this because I don't want to lose
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:00.960]  to the tyrants and our spirit of resistance is spread all over the
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:03.880]  country and all over the world frankly if they kill me or put me in prison or
[02:56:03.880 --> 02:56:08.200]  try to shut us down I've already laid out basically how they operate what they
[02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:12.720]  do the information they hate so much has been blueprinted already so save these
[02:56:12.720 --> 02:56:17.040]  shows say save these radio shows and just continue to you know get your own
[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:22.040]  information out your own research and stay focused the number one thing I've
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:24.680]  done too is not got involved in infighting they're really good at getting
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:28.280]  infighting stirred up in the Liberty Movement divide and conquer stuff I've
[02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:31.040]  just stayed focused on the New World Order focus on the fact they're
[02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:34.120]  unelected focus on the fact they're setting up a world government and
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:38.520]  they're now coming out for a free press they've announced it and then and of
[02:56:38.520 --> 02:56:41.240]  course they have disinformation bots on my own site you know commenting all
[02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:44.200]  everything where is it you're still on air why'd you that petition which we're
[02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:47.440]  printing it's done today it costs us thousands of dollars to print will be a
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:52.000]  five hundred bucks a ship at the Trump Tower and the Congress giant pallet of
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.680]  your hundred thousand signatures now we're gonna reach out people that signed
[02:56:54.680 --> 02:56:57.440]  it and create a first amendment organization the first of them in
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:57:00.800]  defense organization and it will grow organically like we've done they're
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:04.000]  like oh you had a countdown you're still on there was a countdown for how long
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:08.080]  the petition was out oh where's the censorship it's all over the news it's

[02:57:34.760 --> 02:57:39.720]  he's the biggest anti-second amendment they're moving with their deception
[02:57:39.720 --> 02:57:44.760]  against us and now is the time to spread the word now is the time to take
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:49.320]  action now is the time to understand the type of attack we're under now we can

[03:00:17.720 --> 03:00:24.160]  the alex jones show I'm punching out of here about four or five minutes and then
[03:00:24.160 --> 03:00:27.560]  our good friend Roger Stones taking over former head of the Trump campaign I
[03:00:27.560 --> 03:00:31.200]  gotta tell you he's got the sharpest-looking suit I've ever seen on
[03:00:31.200 --> 03:00:35.000]  I am really looks better than anybody on Fox News wish I had that type of style
[03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:39.920]  but Roger Stones here with us with big breaking news big guest in this hour but
[03:00:39.920 --> 03:00:45.240]  Roger I got to tell you my friend they are openly now calling for censoring
[03:00:45.240 --> 03:00:49.920]  myself they're not just saying discredit the alt right they're saying shut us
[03:00:49.920 --> 03:00:55.160]  down they are saying shut Trump down kick him off Twitter as you know they are
[03:00:55.160 --> 03:00:58.640]  going into full hysteria mode and they're all over the news now saying we
[03:00:58.640 --> 03:01:03.080]  are at war with Russia we were under attack they're creating a total hysteria
[03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:08.320]  no one's buying it though they're trying to get the moral cover to claim that
[03:01:08.320 --> 03:01:12.120]  30 something electors aren't gonna go for Trump and I guess try to steal the
[03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:16.280]  election now I know that's bold I know that's crazy but it you know it's the
[03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:21.440]  bold stroke sometimes hits sometimes it misses but again my spider since tells
[03:01:21.440 --> 03:01:24.760]  me they're going for broke like bloodthirsty cornered rats what do you
[03:01:24.760 --> 03:01:32.080]  say Alex this is a full-fledged coup d'etat although a bloodless one this is
[03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:36.600]  a coordinated campaign with several steps first they harped on the popular
[03:01:36.600 --> 03:01:42.160]  vote as if the popular vote decides who's elected president when they the
[03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:46.920]  Clinton campaign operatives themselves admit that they were focused largely on
[03:01:46.920 --> 03:01:53.840]  the Electoral College as was the Trump campaign then secondarily there is this
[03:01:53.840 --> 03:02:00.800]  entire effort to discredit the election and delegitimize the coming Trump
[03:02:00.800 --> 03:02:09.960]  presidency by the unsubstantiated claim that there is Russian hacking so there
[03:02:09.960 --> 03:02:16.720]  is a concerted effort here led by the New York Times and the Washington Post the
[03:02:16.720 --> 03:02:21.240]  two publications who are most out front in their Trump bashing and their
[03:02:21.240 --> 03:02:28.240]  distortion of Trump's positions it is not this is all planned now of the
[03:02:28.240 --> 03:02:34.240]  electors Alex the 30 that have stepped forward all but one of them are partisan
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:40.360]  Democrats they weren't going to be voting for Donald Trump anyway so this is the
[03:02:40.360 --> 03:02:46.240]  last desperate grasp at power by the ruling elite by they're just creating
[03:02:46.240 --> 03:02:51.120]  the illusion that they've got 30 they really don't just as they are creating
[03:02:51.120 --> 03:02:56.160]  the illusion that they have some proof that Russia has hacked our elections
[03:02:56.160 --> 03:02:59.440]  why didn't that crumble quickly the other agency said we never said that we
[03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:05.240]  don't agree with you this is bull well in fact James Clapper who heads the
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:10.320]  Defense Intelligence Agency who's supposed to be coordinating the other 17
[03:03:10.320 --> 03:03:16.360]  agencies tells Reuters he doesn't buy it that it's inconclusive that they haven't
[03:03:16.360 --> 03:03:23.400]  produced any evidence I rechecked again today no Republican member of the House
[03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:30.280]  or Senate Intelligence Committee has seen any evidence hard evidence of Russian
[03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:37.200]  hacking not only that but because of our electoral system where we use a hodge
[03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:42.960]  podge of machines computerized voting machines on which I have written
[03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:51.760]  extensively paper ballots and old the old-time you know jolt machines it is
[03:03:51.760 --> 03:03:58.160]  virtually impossible for a sophisticated hack and there is no evidence of it
[03:03:58.160 --> 03:04:03.880]  none whatsoever today's front page story in the New York Times is riddled with
[03:04:03.880 --> 03:04:10.720]  falsehoods including again repeating the false notion that Julian Assange and
[03:04:10.720 --> 03:04:15.560]  WikiLeaks are in the employ of the Russian okay so recycle lies we're
[03:04:15.560 --> 03:04:18.760]  going to break you're gonna take over I just want to add a cherry on top the
[03:04:18.760 --> 03:04:22.000]  communist Chinese and Saudi Arabians because they bragged about it newspapers
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:26.000]  said they were the biggest financiers basically illegally of Hillary so there's
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:30.600]  the foreign influence plus the illegals plus the Clinton Foundation plus the EU
[03:04:30.600 --> 03:04:35.320]  involved so we should take more of her votes away if they're claiming that
[03:04:35.320 --> 03:04:39.720]  Trump should lose because that's the clear documented outside foreign
[03:04:39.720 --> 03:04:44.480]  entanglement and foreign interference in our election that's what globalism is
[03:04:44.480 --> 03:04:48.960]  in essence I'm Alex Jones signing off from fours dot com and handing the baton
[03:04:48.960 --> 03:04:56.640]  to Roger stone of stone cold truth dot com we'll be back stay with us
[03:04:59.040 --> 03:05:05.760]  Keith Oberman says the election of Donald Trump is like the Japanese bombing
[03:05:05.760 --> 03:05:11.680]  Pearl Harbor and that means war we are at war with Russia or perhaps more
[03:05:11.680 --> 03:05:15.720]  correctly we have lost a war with Russia without a battle we are the victims of a
[03:05:15.720 --> 03:05:21.640]  bloodless coup so far a bloodless coup Donald John Trump a man who to borrow a
[03:05:21.640 --> 03:05:26.880]  phrase from another December long ago we'll live in infamy some experts have
[03:05:26.880 --> 03:05:32.600]  compared this to Pearl Harbor overman posted this crazed rant around 20 times

[03:07:06.600 --> 03:07:10.560]  how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate
[03:07:10.560 --> 03:07:14.880]  IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[03:07:14.880 --> 03:07:19.000]  and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they
[03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:23.080]  took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima

[03:07:41.760 --> 03:07:45.560]  iodine you can pull these studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks
[03:07:45.560 --> 03:07:49.800]  and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum health

[03:08:14.120 --> 03:08:20.800]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty you're listening to the
[03:08:20.800 --> 03:08:24.320]  Alex Jones show
[03:08:24.320 --> 03:08:32.360]  welcome back to info wars I'm Roger Stone sitting in for the great Alex Jones
[03:08:32.360 --> 03:08:38.760]  today we're gonna focus on the actual coup d'etat that's going on before our
[03:08:38.760 --> 03:08:44.760]  very eyes for those on the left and in the power establishment in Washington and
[03:08:44.760 --> 03:08:50.160]  New York and around the globe who do not want to accept the legitimate results of
[03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:56.080]  the 2016 elections during this most recent campaign I was among those accused
[03:08:56.080 --> 03:09:01.560]  of being a Russian agent that's because I supported Donald Trump and I did not
[03:09:01.560 --> 03:09:09.040]  support war in Syria war with Russia in Syria and over the Syrian conflict this
[03:09:09.040 --> 03:09:14.120]  is the new McCarthyism where you are accused of being a traitor to your
[03:09:14.120 --> 03:09:20.360]  country if you're not for a thermonuclear war if you're not for the no-fly zone
[03:09:20.360 --> 03:09:26.720]  over Syria which is surely the first step towards a confrontation with the
[03:09:26.720 --> 03:09:33.560]  Russians there's several problems with this entire narrative first of all there
[03:09:33.560 --> 03:09:42.560]  is no proof whatsoever of this hacking is it just coincidental that the Obama
[03:09:42.560 --> 03:09:49.160]  administration intelligence agencies are now endlessly repeating a Clinton
[03:09:49.160 --> 03:09:54.880]  campaign talking point that the Russian were aiding Trump that the Russians were
[03:09:54.880 --> 03:10:00.440]  hacking the election I find this particularly humorous in view of the
[03:10:00.440 --> 03:10:05.620]  fact that when I wrote about my concerns that the Democrats would hack the
[03:10:05.620 --> 03:10:10.400]  elections in the urban centers in the country where I believe there is actually
[03:10:10.400 --> 03:10:17.760]  a track record of having done so I was ridiculed by David Brock and the
[03:10:17.760 --> 03:10:23.920]  running dog lackeys of the Clinton spin machine I was called a conspiracy
[03:10:23.920 --> 03:10:29.960]  theorist because I even believe that the election could be hacked by domestic
[03:10:29.960 --> 03:10:35.600]  entities who are in control of the actual machines of course the Russians
[03:10:35.600 --> 03:10:42.520]  are not in control of any computerized voting machines then of course we have
[03:10:42.520 --> 03:10:48.160]  in addition to lack of proof the repeated denials of Julian Assange that
[03:10:48.160 --> 03:10:53.600]  he works for the Russians that he has received materials from the Russians and
[03:10:53.600 --> 03:11:01.280]  in fact that the leaker of the Democratic National Committee documents that
[03:11:01.280 --> 03:11:08.480]  proved that the DNC under Debbie Wasserman Schultz had to cheat wire the
[03:11:08.480 --> 03:11:13.360]  debates and wire the system so that Hillary Clinton could beat Bernie
[03:11:13.360 --> 03:11:20.600]  Saunders we know that that source was human intelligence a leaker most
[03:11:20.600 --> 03:11:27.640]  likely the late Seth Rice who as you know I think took four slugs to the back
[03:11:27.640 --> 03:11:34.760]  now the mainstream media told us it was a botched robbery but Seth's father told
[03:11:34.760 --> 03:11:42.920]  us that his watch and his currency and his jewel was untouched if you raise the
[03:11:42.920 --> 03:11:48.800]  question of whether he was murdered because he was leaking to Assange why
[03:11:48.800 --> 03:11:58.400]  then they call you a conspiracy theorist we we also have the startling
[03:11:58.400 --> 03:12:03.960]  revelation now by John McCain who first jumped on the bandwagon demanding a
[03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:11.280]  full investigation but now even McCain no fan of Donald J. Trump tells us that
[03:12:11.280 --> 03:12:17.440]  there is no proof that he has seen no proof that the Russians were successful
[03:12:17.440 --> 03:12:23.280]  in hacking our elections we've got a great show for you today I'm joined by
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:28.640]  the Breitbart News Washington bureau chief Matt Boyle who will talk to us
[03:12:28.640 --> 03:12:37.000]  about fake news and the effort to censor info wars Breitbart news the daily
[03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:44.160]  caller stone cold truth calm and anybody who doesn't tow the mainstream media
[03:12:44.160 --> 03:12:50.840]  line we also are going to be joined by st. John Hunt st. John Hunt is a
[03:12:50.840 --> 03:13:00.120]  Renaissance man he is a an author a a songwriter a guitarist a singer a poet
[03:13:00.120 --> 03:13:08.440]  and we are honored to have him because he is of course the son of the legendary
[03:13:08.440 --> 03:13:18.920]  CIA agent and Watergate burglar E Howard Hunt almost no one knows more about the
[03:13:18.920 --> 03:13:26.680]  CIA and their misdeeds and their history of lies right through Benghazi right
[03:13:26.680 --> 03:13:32.800]  through the current day where today they're lying about Russian interference
[03:13:32.800 --> 03:13:39.280]  in order to present an issue aimed solely at the Electoral College which
[03:13:39.280 --> 03:13:46.440]  submits its votes on Monday do not think that there is no Republican effort to
[03:13:46.440 --> 03:13:53.600]  track electors there is and based on my sources the Republican electors are
[03:13:53.600 --> 03:13:59.680]  standing tall and firm for Donald Trump so far we know of one Republican
[03:13:59.680 --> 03:14:05.680]  defector that will be not sufficient to overturn the will of the American
[03:14:05.680 --> 03:14:15.360]  people I'm told that Matt Boyle is on the line we can go to him now although I
[03:14:15.360 --> 03:14:20.640]  thought we were heading to a break if we are if we're ready Matt Boyle thanks
[03:14:20.640 --> 03:14:28.400]  for joining us here at info wars calm thanks Roger for having me Matt because
[03:14:28.400 --> 03:14:35.040]  Breitbart news is one of those publications that is targeted for
[03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:41.360]  censorship and has appeared on various lists compiled by the left and because
[03:14:41.360 --> 03:14:46.560]  of an appropriation for the thought police that seems to be working its way
[03:14:46.560 --> 03:14:50.800]  through the Congress in which the US federal government would seem to have
[03:14:50.800 --> 03:14:55.960]  the authority to decide what is fake news and what is not give me your take on
[03:14:55.960 --> 03:15:00.720]  this effort and whether you think they can be successful in silencing the
[03:15:00.720 --> 03:15:04.840]  voices of freedom I don't think they're gonna silence us what they're trying to
[03:15:04.840 --> 03:15:07.760]  do I mean the truth through the law I don't think they're gonna they'll
[03:15:07.760 --> 03:15:10.760]  succeed on that element what they're trying to do is they're trying to drag
[03:15:10.760 --> 03:15:16.120]  our names through the mud so that we can't continue to grow and win over new
[03:15:16.120 --> 03:15:21.040]  supporters but here's what's happening what their their efforts to attack us at
[03:15:21.040 --> 03:15:26.200]  Breitbart and in other places all the places you mentioned are our going our
[03:15:26.200 --> 03:15:32.440]  backfiring what's happening is is that people who are open-minded and aren't
[03:15:32.440 --> 03:15:37.640]  you know completely sold by the political left and the political
[03:15:37.640 --> 03:15:42.960]  establishment get drawn to Breitbart what they're doing is by continually
[03:15:42.960 --> 03:15:47.040]  attacking us they're drawing more and more people to our to our site and what's
[03:15:47.040 --> 03:15:49.760]  happening is is that then they're like oh well these guys aren't all that
[03:15:49.760 --> 03:15:55.200]  unreasonable they're actually reasonable there there's stories are better in many
[03:15:55.200 --> 03:15:59.640]  ways and they do a better job of covering the news than say CNN or the
[03:15:59.640 --> 03:16:03.680]  New York Times or sometimes even some other places throughout the establishment
[03:16:03.680 --> 03:16:08.480]  right media right like a fox or a weekly standard or a national review and so
[03:16:08.480 --> 03:16:14.840]  what happens is is as these people I start coming to our site and you know
[03:16:14.840 --> 03:16:17.880]  the reason they're what they're doing is they're calling us racist they're
[03:16:17.880 --> 03:16:22.240]  calling us fake news they're calling us white nationalists we're nothing of
[03:16:22.240 --> 03:16:27.720]  this sort where we we were one of the few outlets that that correctly reported
[03:16:27.720 --> 03:16:31.960]  not just on the this election the whole trajectory of the election of the
[03:16:31.960 --> 03:16:36.520]  presidential race in the US but the Brexit race over in the UK we have a
[03:16:36.520 --> 03:16:42.240]  whole London Bureau that's doing all reporting on that we we have a world
[03:16:42.240 --> 03:16:46.800]  class coverage of Congress of the federal agencies of major major scandals
[03:16:46.800 --> 03:16:54.320]  in Washington and and because we had all of that right I would submit that we
[03:16:54.320 --> 03:17:00.600]  are the real news and they are the fake news CNN which you know repeatedly over
[03:17:00.600 --> 03:17:04.160]  and over again said that Donald Trump wouldn't win the election New York
[03:17:04.160 --> 03:17:08.840]  Times which had it what was it 80% Donald Trump was going to lose even on
[03:17:08.840 --> 03:17:15.240]  election night when the polls closed on the Huffington Post had it as 99% I
[03:17:15.240 --> 03:17:19.120]  think it was that that Hillary Clinton was going to win the election those
[03:17:19.120 --> 03:17:24.480]  people all got it wrong they're the fake news so you know I think that you know
[03:17:24.480 --> 03:17:28.720]  while there there does appear to be efforts by those in the political
[03:17:28.720 --> 03:17:33.320]  establishment to try to to try to silence us using the power of the
[03:17:33.320 --> 03:17:36.720]  government or something I don't think that those are going to be successful I
[03:17:36.720 --> 03:17:42.240]  think the the American people are too smart to fall for some kind of a thing
[03:17:42.240 --> 03:17:45.220]  that would limit the First Amendment so I don't I don't think we're going to
[03:17:45.220 --> 03:17:48.840]  see anything like that what you are seeing is is that you're going to see
[03:17:48.840 --> 03:17:55.800]  them try to discredit us and try to drag our names through the mud so that
[03:17:55.800 --> 03:18:00.360]  people don't trust us but that that what they've been doing for years is it
[03:18:00.360 --> 03:18:06.240]  always backfires because we're always right and they're always wrong yeah it
[03:18:06.240 --> 03:18:11.160]  is absolutely true what you say I noticed that in this most recent election
[03:18:11.160 --> 03:18:16.920]  when President Barack Obama attacked info wars by name when Hillary Clinton
[03:18:16.920 --> 03:18:22.400]  attacked Alex Jones by name actually produced a campaign TV commercial
[03:18:22.400 --> 03:18:28.920]  attacking Alex Jones all they did was increase the listenership and viewership
[03:18:28.920 --> 03:18:34.640]  of info wars they are helping to build our audience and I agree when people go
[03:18:34.640 --> 03:18:39.200]  to these alternative sites whether it's Breitbart or info wars or the Daily
[03:18:39.200 --> 03:18:44.800]  Caller or Town Hall or a number of other excellent sites they're cutting through
[03:18:44.800 --> 03:18:50.080]  the BS and they're realizing that this is the real news now I watched CNN this
[03:18:50.080 --> 03:18:57.600]  morning and nowhere did I see them report that no one has yet seen any proof
[03:18:57.600 --> 03:19:05.160]  whatsoever of the so-called Russian hacking ergo they are the fake news we
[03:19:05.160 --> 03:19:09.520]  do have a fake news problem in this country but it's mostly seated at the
[03:19:09.520 --> 03:19:17.000]  three national broadcast networks and at the two cable networks that's where I
[03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:21.960]  think you can find the fake news Matt what is the what is the attitude of your
[03:19:21.960 --> 03:19:28.520]  colleagues at Breitbart over this onslaught and do you think those in the
[03:19:28.520 --> 03:19:34.280]  upcoming Trump administration beyond Steve Bannon of course are aware we're
[03:19:34.280 --> 03:19:38.400]  gonna go to a break we'll come back to Matt Boyle and get his answer here in

[03:25:28.880 --> 03:25:33.280]  Breitbart News the Washington Bureau Chief Matt tell me what your colleagues
[03:25:33.280 --> 03:25:37.320]  think of this assault on free speech and whether you think that the key people in
[03:25:37.320 --> 03:25:43.080]  the Trump administration are aware of the fight that's about to come yeah I think
[03:25:43.080 --> 03:25:46.960]  that the Trump administration is ready for it I mean you mentioned Steve Bannon
[03:25:46.960 --> 03:25:50.760]  I mean he was obviously our executive chairman until he went to go be the CEO
[03:25:50.760 --> 03:25:55.680]  of the Trump campaign in August I think he's keenly aware of it and many of the
[03:25:55.680 --> 03:26:00.120]  other aides I've talked to throughout the incoming Trump administration and I'm
[03:26:00.120 --> 03:26:04.280]  meeting with them constantly they are they're very aware of what what is going
[03:26:04.280 --> 03:26:09.720]  on on this front my colleagues here at Breitbart are fired up I've gotten away
[03:26:09.720 --> 03:26:14.600]  from using the term Roger the mainstream media to describe the establishment
[03:26:14.600 --> 03:26:19.320]  legacy media I don't think they're mainstream anymore I think what we've
[03:26:19.320 --> 03:26:24.640]  crossed a Rubicon over the course of the 2016 election where Breitbart daily
[03:26:24.640 --> 03:26:30.440]  call our info wars etc are then the new mainstream media we represent mainstream
[03:26:30.440 --> 03:26:37.680]  American thought and and we are the majority and and we are our views are
[03:26:37.680 --> 03:26:43.480]  correct and they are mainstream whereas CNN, Politico, New York Times, these are
[03:26:43.480 --> 03:26:49.760]  fringe organizations on the periphery of American society so you know our team
[03:26:49.760 --> 03:26:55.200]  is fired up look I'm actually in communication with a number of top
[03:26:55.200 --> 03:26:58.560]  journalists and by the way I know that you know I disparage a lot of these
[03:26:58.560 --> 03:27:02.360]  legacy establishment media outlets but some of the people that work there are
[03:27:02.360 --> 03:27:05.960]  decent people they want to just to go out there and do stories and that the
[03:27:05.960 --> 03:27:10.120]  executives at the top of these companies that are giving down orders that don't
[03:27:10.120 --> 03:27:14.680]  allow them to do so so many of them are and I think you're gonna see a sea
[03:27:14.680 --> 03:27:19.760]  change walking into this you know into 2017 here where you're gonna see a lot
[03:27:19.760 --> 03:27:23.200]  of people throughout these established with media operations are gonna leave
[03:27:23.200 --> 03:27:27.960]  en masse and I kind of look at Breitbart almost like it's Noah's Ark right for
[03:27:27.960 --> 03:27:31.880]  the people that want to do journalism you know again there are people all
[03:27:31.880 --> 03:27:37.600]  throughout the entire media apparatus right now that are basically dying to
[03:27:37.600 --> 03:27:41.800]  come work here and so you know I'm spending an ordered amount of time
[03:27:41.800 --> 03:27:45.960]  right now going through resumes and talking to a lot of people some of them
[03:27:45.960 --> 03:27:49.280]  were household names and so I mean I'm not gonna give them out right now until
[03:27:49.280 --> 03:27:53.680]  they're the a lot of them are official and final but the thing is is that the
[03:27:53.680 --> 03:27:58.880]  entire establishment media apparatus because these executives lean so far the
[03:27:58.880 --> 03:28:02.040]  wrong way over the course of this election they're losing their clout
[03:28:02.040 --> 03:28:05.120]  they're losing their power they're losing their ability to control the
[03:28:05.120 --> 03:28:10.320]  narrative well Matt I agree I think we reached a tipping point where the
[03:28:10.320 --> 03:28:16.400]  monopoly of the old media let's call them that has finally been broken and a
[03:28:16.400 --> 03:28:20.280]  majority of Americans are getting their news particularly their political news
[03:28:20.280 --> 03:28:26.040]  on their handheld device and that means the end for broadcast TV as we know it
[03:28:26.040 --> 03:28:31.800]  it means the end ultimately for cable as well where people are going to go get
[03:28:31.800 --> 03:28:37.160]  their news particularly at a time of their own choosing this is open open the
[03:28:37.160 --> 03:28:43.160]  door to the Trump revolution and it was particularly important because the Trump
[03:28:43.160 --> 03:28:49.480]  campaign had far fewer resources to spend on paid media the idea that you
[03:28:49.480 --> 03:28:56.400]  could come on and buy wall-to-wall saturation broadcast television advertising
[03:28:56.400 --> 03:29:02.640]  to dominate an election is now outdated thinking in fact digital advertising in
[03:29:02.640 --> 03:29:08.280]  this most recent campaign has proved to be far more effective with about a
[03:29:08.280 --> 03:29:12.240]  minute to go Matt give me your quick assessment on Donald Trump's cabinet
[03:29:12.240 --> 03:29:17.400]  picks so far I think he's gonna an interesting collection of individuals
[03:29:17.400 --> 03:29:21.600]  I really like the generals the business executives that he's bringing in these
[03:29:21.600 --> 03:29:26.000]  are people that have a proven track record of getting things done and so I
[03:29:26.000 --> 03:29:29.960]  think he's keeping his promise he's kind of showing to the American people that
[03:29:29.960 --> 03:29:33.840]  he's gonna bring in people that aren't part of the political class in
[03:29:33.840 --> 03:29:38.920]  Washington DC and and you know he's gonna shake up the way things work in
[03:29:38.920 --> 03:29:43.200]  in American politics or on the world stage all right Matt Boyle thanks for
[03:29:43.200 --> 03:29:53.160]  joining us here at info wars we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex
[03:29:53.160 --> 03:29:57.480]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:29:59.520 --> 03:30:05.840]  Keith Oberman says the election of Donald Trump is like the Japanese bombing
[03:30:05.840 --> 03:30:11.760]  Pearl Harbor and that means war we are at war with Russia or perhaps more
[03:30:11.760 --> 03:30:15.760]  correctly we have lost a war with Russia without a battle we are the victims of a
[03:30:15.760 --> 03:30:21.680]  bloodless coup so far a bloodless coup Donald John Trump a man who to borrow a
[03:30:21.680 --> 03:30:26.920]  phrase from another December long ago we'll live in infamy some experts have
[03:30:26.920 --> 03:30:32.680]  compared this to Pearl Harbor Oberman posted this crazed rant around 20 times
[03:30:32.680 --> 03:30:38.320]  on his Twitter timeline where he went on to yell and scream that January 20th
[03:30:38.320 --> 03:30:43.280]  will be the end of the United States of America the nation and all of our
[03:30:43.280 --> 03:30:47.120]  freedoms hang by a thread and the military apparatus of this country is

[03:35:45.640 --> 03:35:50.840]  welcome to info wars where I'm proud to be sitting in for my friend Alex Jones
[03:35:50.840 --> 03:35:55.600]  thank you Roger it's a pleasure to be here I appreciate it so outline for us
[03:35:55.600 --> 03:36:00.640]  you're thinking a year I know a man who follows the political news and you've
[03:36:00.640 --> 03:36:05.600]  seen this slow-motion coup d'etat that the Democrats are attempting to pull off
[03:36:05.600 --> 03:36:11.200]  why shouldn't we believe our intelligence agencies well let me say
[03:36:11.200 --> 03:36:14.320]  first of all that it's it's shameful what's going on in this country today
[03:36:14.320 --> 03:36:19.560]  and and the way the news media spinning mr. Trump to be some sort of
[03:36:19.560 --> 03:36:24.600]  irresponsible person that doesn't care about the briefings to he clearly
[03:36:24.600 --> 03:36:28.120]  stated that his vice president would be in charge of the daily briefings I
[03:36:28.120 --> 03:36:34.240]  understand full well that that that the CIA since its inception after one more
[03:36:34.240 --> 03:36:43.640]  two has been bent on a one-way street to you know to subvert the the foreign
[03:36:43.640 --> 03:36:49.680]  freedom of other countries for for personal gain for this country and I've
[03:36:49.680 --> 03:36:56.080]  seen it because my father was in the CIA for for 27 years and I can attest to the
[03:36:56.080 --> 03:37:03.920]  fact that that the CIA is is riddled with low-level intelligence people that
[03:37:03.920 --> 03:37:10.800]  are just you know continuing the CIA philosophy of let's get in there and take
[03:37:10.800 --> 03:37:17.640]  what we can on a worldwide basis starting as early as 1953 in Iran they
[03:37:17.640 --> 03:37:24.320]  overthrew the democratically elected premier Mohammed Muzadik and that was
[03:37:24.320 --> 03:37:28.600]  for to help the British regain their control of oil so that's a greed factor
[03:37:28.600 --> 03:37:33.040]  right there then in 1954 my father was personally involved in the overthrow of
[03:37:33.040 --> 03:37:40.360]  Jacob R. Benz in Guatemala which was also I think dictated by greed and you
[03:37:40.360 --> 03:37:44.240]  know personal gain for the Dallas brothers who were on the board of United
[03:37:44.240 --> 03:37:49.880]  Fruit Company and this was an issue that cost a thousands and thousands of
[03:37:49.880 --> 03:37:54.440]  lives followed by the Bay of Pigs which was a complete fiasco as everybody knows
[03:37:54.440 --> 03:37:59.080]  and brought the world to really the brink of of World War three this has gone
[03:37:59.080 --> 03:38:03.640]  on for decades and decades the fact that Donald Trump does not want to have a
[03:38:03.640 --> 03:38:07.360]  daily briefings is is a good idea I think he's bringing his sense of
[03:38:07.360 --> 03:38:15.560]  business to to an otherwise failed political situation where where where
[03:38:15.560 --> 03:38:20.960]  he's he's wary of the CIA and he rightfully should be the CIA has gone on
[03:38:20.960 --> 03:38:28.120]  continued 1965 to 72 they ran a campaign in in Vietnam called the Phoenix
[03:38:28.120 --> 03:38:35.320]  program which murdered up to 60,000 civilians based on their on their
[03:38:35.320 --> 03:38:41.520]  political beliefs at 79 they misjudged the entire Iranian situation six months
[03:38:41.520 --> 03:38:45.960]  before the Iranian Revolution they advised in their national intelligence
[03:38:45.960 --> 03:38:50.920]  estimate which is the briefing that Mr. Trump would be seeing that that Iran
[03:38:50.920 --> 03:38:56.280]  was not in a revolutionary or pre-revolutionary state in 1990 the
[03:38:56.280 --> 03:39:02.920]  CIA dismissed the likelihood of the Iraq invasion in Kuwait 2002 the the NIE the
[03:39:02.920 --> 03:39:07.440]  national intelligence estimate stated that Iraq has continued to build up of
[03:39:07.440 --> 03:39:12.000]  WMD's which we know was just a complete falsehood so so there there's an
[03:39:12.000 --> 03:39:17.560]  element here of of the news reporting that Trump doesn't want the daily
[03:39:17.560 --> 03:39:22.640]  briefings but what really they should be reporting is on the CIA's complete
[03:39:22.640 --> 03:39:28.040]  history of failed intelligence gathering services and reporting that's what I
[03:39:28.040 --> 03:39:32.440]  think well it's interesting that Trump in his formal statement actually fired
[03:39:32.440 --> 03:39:37.680]  back and said you know when the CIA asserted that the election had been
[03:39:37.680 --> 03:39:41.480]  hacked by the Russians he pointed out these are the exact same people that
[03:39:41.480 --> 03:39:47.000]  told us Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction what good is a briefing
[03:39:47.000 --> 03:39:51.480]  if the information contained in the briefing is wrong or or if it is put
[03:39:51.480 --> 03:39:57.000]  there with motive if it's disinformation it's purposely being fed to the chief
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:02.600]  executive I think the president is wise to have his vice president wade through
[03:40:02.600 --> 03:40:08.520]  the information and determine what's real and what is not real this is an
[03:40:08.520 --> 03:40:14.720]  attempt to belittle Trump it's an attempt to delegitimize him but I have
[03:40:14.720 --> 03:40:22.400]  some concerns about our incoming CIA director congressman Pompeo I am hopeful
[03:40:22.400 --> 03:40:27.880]  that he will be loyal to the Trump agenda it bothered me when he said that he
[03:40:27.880 --> 03:40:32.120]  believed Edward Snowden should be executed first of all I think mr. Snowden
[03:40:32.120 --> 03:40:38.320]  should have a trial before anything such as that was undertaken but the hysteria
[03:40:38.320 --> 03:40:44.640]  that has gripped the ruling elite and in this case their instrument being the
[03:40:44.640 --> 03:40:50.640]  central intelligence agency they are running a campaign aimed at the electoral
[03:40:50.640 --> 03:40:59.520]  college it is extraordinary in its nakedness the idea of Barack Obama
[03:40:59.520 --> 03:41:06.400]  instructing the central intelligence agency to brief these electors most of
[03:41:06.400 --> 03:41:12.720]  whom are party regulars in both camps has forced the Trump campaign to or the
[03:41:12.720 --> 03:41:17.680]  Trump camp I should say to have an operation to track the electors now
[03:41:17.680 --> 03:41:24.200]  this was done before in 2000 when a shift of one elector would have made a
[03:41:24.200 --> 03:41:30.080]  difference of course that didn't happen George W. Bush was successfully elected
[03:41:30.080 --> 03:41:36.320]  president in this case I think they need a shift of 40 votes to change the
[03:41:36.320 --> 03:41:43.520]  outcome of this election I still call it unlikely but to be clear the globalists
[03:41:43.520 --> 03:41:50.480]  will stop at nothing they will never give up they will never come to terms with a
[03:41:50.480 --> 03:41:55.640]  Trump administration they will do anything they can to delegitimize the
[03:41:55.640 --> 03:41:59.560]  incoming administration and if they could wave a wand and put Hillary Clinton
[03:41:59.560 --> 03:42:04.720]  into power tomorrow they would definitely do so yeah I agree thoroughly
[03:42:04.720 --> 03:42:13.200]  Roger I think that the that the that those globalists are set in continuing
[03:42:13.200 --> 03:42:19.640]  the the the story that the Russians are our our bitter enemies I don't think
[03:42:19.640 --> 03:42:24.920]  that's true anymore I think a mr. mr. Trump is a businessman I think mr. Putin
[03:42:24.920 --> 03:42:28.960]  is in his own sense a businessman I think he wants to do business I think they
[03:42:28.960 --> 03:42:34.120]  want to do business and as long as the the agenda is being pushed by the media
[03:42:34.120 --> 03:42:39.400]  and by and by the leftist there that that Russia is our sworn enemies it's
[03:42:39.400 --> 03:42:42.440]  going to be hard to change things but we got to keep trying and that's why info
[03:42:42.440 --> 03:42:46.640]  words is so important and an incredible piece that I read this morning showed
[03:42:46.640 --> 03:42:52.560]  that a labor MP in the UK is now trying to claim that the Russians hacked the
[03:42:52.560 --> 03:42:59.680]  Brexit vote this is how absurd this entire thing is becoming globalism is
[03:42:59.680 --> 03:43:06.040]  being rejected around the world and the the Rockefellers and the other
[03:43:06.040 --> 03:43:11.480]  stalwarts within the globalist establishment are in utter disbelief
[03:43:11.480 --> 03:43:16.880]  that their trail of lies and their economic destruction and their history
[03:43:16.880 --> 03:43:21.760]  of wars are now catching up with them and just as the people of Europe are
[03:43:21.760 --> 03:43:28.600]  becoming wise to the globalist agenda so are the American people now finally you
[03:43:28.600 --> 03:43:33.200]  have a president who's standing up for American jobs who is going to stop the
[03:43:33.200 --> 03:43:39.920]  flow of both jobs and capital abroad this is not in the globalist playbook
[03:43:39.920 --> 03:43:47.440]  which is why I think you have this kind of hysteria I'm kind of interested
[03:43:47.440 --> 03:43:54.080]  st. John in your view on the recent fall of Castro given your father's
[03:43:54.080 --> 03:43:59.920]  expertise in Cuban affairs and the fact that your dad was involved in numerous
[03:43:59.920 --> 03:44:06.080]  attempts to assassinate Castro and then he was involved in the disastrous Bay
[03:44:06.080 --> 03:44:12.520]  of Pigs invasion do you think the fall of Castro at least I should say the death
[03:44:12.520 --> 03:44:18.880]  of Fidel Castro is going to lead to democratic reforms in our lifetime
[03:44:18.880 --> 03:44:24.280]  well that's a tough question to answer but no I don't think change is going to
[03:44:24.280 --> 03:44:31.240]  come about that rapidly there is change notice there already slowly and it
[03:44:31.240 --> 03:44:37.160]  depends what is you know what his brother is is going to put forth but
[03:44:37.160 --> 03:44:46.080]  Castro has been immortalized in a very romantic sense worldwide so it's hard
[03:44:46.080 --> 03:44:50.960]  to it's hard to beat that when the media paints him as a as a romantic freedom
[03:44:50.960 --> 03:44:58.480]  loving you know for the people type of persona when in reality he may have been
[03:44:58.480 --> 03:45:04.400]  that at the very early stages of the of the Cuban Revolution back in 1958-59 he
[03:45:04.400 --> 03:45:09.520]  very quickly turned into a murderous dictator that imprisoned and killed
[03:45:09.520 --> 03:45:16.720]  thousands and thousands and thousands of Cubans that were not aligned to him and
[03:45:16.720 --> 03:45:22.080]  this is something that's not really talked about it's a lot easier to you
[03:45:22.080 --> 03:45:26.440]  know to wear Castro and Jacob are t-shirts without you know without the
[03:45:26.440 --> 03:45:30.440]  knowledge of what they really stood for yeah I think you're absolutely right he
[03:45:30.440 --> 03:45:37.280]  is he's a mass murderer up there with Hitler and with Stalin I mean in 1953 I
[03:45:37.280 --> 03:45:41.880]  believe it was vice president Richard Nixon was assigned by Dwight Eisenhower
[03:45:41.880 --> 03:45:48.240]  to meet with Castro for an assessment Eisenhower is the US head of state of
[03:45:48.240 --> 03:45:52.400]  course couldn't meet with Castro because it would have connoted recognition so
[03:45:52.400 --> 03:45:57.760]  Nixon was assigned to meet with the bearded dictator we didn't know he was a
[03:45:57.760 --> 03:46:04.720]  dictator yet and it's interesting although in that meeting Castro professed
[03:46:04.720 --> 03:46:10.720]  democratic leaning small D Nixon would go on to write a memo to Eisenhower
[03:46:10.720 --> 03:46:17.080]  telling him that in his view Castro was a hard-line communist aligned with the
[03:46:17.080 --> 03:46:22.640]  Soviets who would abridge all human rights and freedoms in in Cuba which of
[03:46:22.640 --> 03:46:30.640]  course is exactly what came to pass almost 50 years later Castro met with
[03:46:30.640 --> 03:46:35.760]  president Nixon son-in-law Ed Cox a longtime personal friend of mine and
[03:46:35.760 --> 03:46:43.640]  after some exchange of pleasantries Castro said to Ed Cox so tell me how did
[03:46:43.640 --> 03:46:50.320]  your father-in-law know I was a communist there it is for you folks the idea of
[03:46:50.320 --> 03:46:55.440]  Castro is some kind of modern-day Robin Hood is a false narrative of the
[03:46:55.440 --> 03:47:02.160]  mainstream media the idea that you can open Cuba up by doing business there
[03:47:02.160 --> 03:47:07.680]  with the idea that the benefits will trickle down to the people misunderstands
[03:47:07.680 --> 03:47:13.680]  the Cuban system under the Cuban system foreign businesses whether they be from
[03:47:13.680 --> 03:47:19.560]  Spain whether they be from the United States must partner not with a Cuban
[03:47:19.560 --> 03:47:24.200]  businessman or woman not with a Cuban entrepreneur but you must partner with
[03:47:24.200 --> 03:47:29.680]  the government the government is your partner you pay them dollars they pay
[03:47:29.680 --> 03:47:37.000]  the people worthless pesos and it provides the money to a reinvigorate
[03:47:37.000 --> 03:47:41.960]  and fund the secret police people still disappear in the middle of the night in
[03:47:41.960 --> 03:47:47.900]  Cuba one cannot have a gathering in their home say a birthday party or a card
[03:47:47.900 --> 03:47:53.320]  game without a representative from the party present to be sure that it isn't
[03:47:53.320 --> 03:47:58.480]  a meeting for the purposes of plotting the violent overthrow of the government
[03:47:58.480 --> 03:48:05.440]  so many Americans have this romantic notion of Cuba as a beautiful place and
[03:48:05.440 --> 03:48:12.160]  a socialist utopia where health care for example is free what they don't know is
[03:48:12.160 --> 03:48:17.920]  about that the Cuban people have no freedom of religion no freedom of
[03:48:17.920 --> 03:48:25.640]  assembly no freedom no freedom of the speech and no freedom of any kind under
[03:48:25.640 --> 03:48:34.160]  the heavy jackboot of the Castro's and my wife insists that that Raul Castro is
[03:48:34.160 --> 03:48:41.080]  more vicious and more hard-line than his brother it is it is therefore we can
[03:48:41.080 --> 03:48:48.520]  only hope the embargo was successful even more successful after the enormous
[03:48:48.520 --> 03:48:56.680]  Soviet subsidies for the Cuban system were cut off so st. John are you what's
[03:48:56.680 --> 03:49:01.400]  your your view now of the Trump administration I know you were early
[03:49:01.400 --> 03:49:06.720]  a skeptic we had numerous conversations you are you're not necessarily a
[03:49:06.720 --> 03:49:11.200]  Republican I know you kind of view yourself as an independent how do you
[03:49:11.200 --> 03:49:15.040]  think he's doing with about a minute and a half left give us your assessment well
[03:49:15.040 --> 03:49:18.800]  you're right at the throughout most the election I was I wasn't sold on Trump but
[03:49:18.800 --> 03:49:25.840]  I was fully anti against Hillary because I know she's a criminal of the
[03:49:25.840 --> 03:49:31.080]  largest sort and she should be prosecuted to the extent of the law every
[03:49:31.080 --> 03:49:37.640]  bit of the law and but Trump I believe is really come about I went to a Trump
[03:49:37.640 --> 03:49:42.440]  rally here in Fort Lauderdale and was impressed but beyond that I think Trump
[03:49:42.440 --> 03:49:47.120]  is going to do a good job if he will be allowed to do a good job but this
[03:49:47.120 --> 03:49:53.080]  constant haranguing this constant you know malfeasance of you know the words
[03:49:53.080 --> 03:50:00.400]  the the anti-trump slinging is is just it's embarrassing to me as a as a as an
[03:50:00.400 --> 03:50:04.840]  American citizen that to have this kind of negativity thrown at someone who
[03:50:04.840 --> 03:50:08.680]  hasn't even started their job yet I mean let the guy alone let him do his job and
[03:50:08.680 --> 03:50:12.520]  then get let's find it that's let's wait a year six months and see how he's
[03:50:12.520 --> 03:50:16.440]  doing then we can start slinging stuff if we if we don't like what he's doing or
[03:50:16.440 --> 03:50:20.760]  if he's gone gone off the tracks but now let him do his job let him pick his
[03:50:20.760 --> 03:50:25.240]  cabinet let him do what he's supposed to do and give him a break he won fair and
[03:50:25.240 --> 03:50:30.440]  square that's all there is to it I think that's an excellent assessment so St.
[03:50:30.440 --> 03:50:35.720]  John Hunt joining us here on info wars.com many thanks for outlining the
[03:50:35.720 --> 03:50:41.680]  CIA's legacy of lies including their most recent lie that the Russians have

[03:55:49.560 --> 03:55:55.400]  Christmas. They make great stocking stuffers. Now, as most of you know, I'm
[03:55:55.400 --> 03:56:01.600]  working on a book that I believe will be the definitive explanation of how
[03:56:01.600 --> 03:56:08.120]  Donald J. Trump pulled the greatest political upset in American political
[03:56:08.120 --> 03:56:15.200]  history. This book is more than just a polemic about the 2016 election. We're
[03:56:15.200 --> 03:56:21.720]  also going to chart the rise of the alternative media, including InfoWars
[03:56:21.720 --> 03:56:28.640]  and Breitbart and others who I believe played a major role in this election.
[03:56:28.640 --> 03:56:33.240]  There's a lot of secrets that are going to be buried deep in this book. So it's
[03:56:33.240 --> 03:56:39.680]  not only a look at the big national trends and the international developments
[03:56:39.680 --> 03:56:45.560]  that created the perfect storm, which elected Donald Trump, but we're also
[03:56:45.560 --> 03:56:50.160]  going to get down with a lot of down-and-dirty vignettes from the actual
[03:56:50.160 --> 03:56:56.200]  campaign trail, including Hillary Clinton's violent reaction to the results
[03:56:56.200 --> 03:57:02.480]  on election night in which she was kicking, screaming, hitting people, yelling,
[03:57:02.480 --> 03:57:08.960]  throwing things, and ultimately had to be sedated. I have this from some of the
[03:57:08.960 --> 03:57:15.680]  best sources in the Democratic Party. And even today, Hillary Clinton and her
[03:57:15.680 --> 03:57:23.640]  global stylized have not given up on their effort to overturn the results of
[03:57:23.640 --> 03:57:29.760]  our most recent Democratic and fairly conducted election and turn over power
[03:57:29.760 --> 03:57:36.360]  to Donald Trump. The recount, which you've heard so much about in Wisconsin
[03:57:36.360 --> 03:57:45.080]  ultimately yielded a net gain of 131 votes for Donald Trump. The recount in
[03:57:45.080 --> 03:57:52.560]  Michigan turned out nothing. The recount in Pennsylvania filed too late under that
[03:57:52.560 --> 03:57:58.280]  state's law. So the recount canard launched as part of the three-pronged
[03:57:58.280 --> 03:58:04.920]  attack on the outcome of this election has been an ignominious failure. First,
[03:58:04.920 --> 03:58:09.960]  they harped on the popular vote, then they demanded the recount, now it's Russian
[03:58:09.960 --> 03:58:15.360]  hacking. Stand up for the results of this election and thanks for joining me
[03:58:15.360 --> 03:58:21.280]  here at infowars.com. We are the resistance, we are the tip of the spear,
[03:58:21.280 --> 03:58:39.440]  we are the new Trump Revolution.
