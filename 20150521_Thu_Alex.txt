[00:48.880 --> 00:57.120]  ship of the Eugenicist forces here in Austin Texas Planned Parenthood and
[00:57.120 --> 01:01.240]  Jacarie Jackson is basically leading a protest out there that just kicked off
[01:01.240 --> 01:10.040]  about a minute ago and again that is on Ben White Boulevard in South Austin
[01:10.040 --> 01:20.720]  Planned Parenthood 201 East Ben White 78704 today and we're just out on the
[01:20.720 --> 01:27.880]  sidewalk by the access road a lot of traffic a lot of people to educate we've
[01:27.880 --> 01:31.480]  got a whole bunch of big black and white signs printed up the show Margaret
[01:31.480 --> 01:36.600]  Sanger being saluted by the Ku Klux Klan and we just point out that all of this
[01:36.600 --> 01:42.840]  race baiting and demonization of say white people in general by the media is
[01:42.840 --> 01:46.840]  just divide and conquer everybody knows that has got half a brain but still
[01:46.840 --> 01:52.000]  political correctness says hey don't have a brown paper bag in Seattle or it's
[01:52.000 --> 02:01.960]  racist I'm not kidding if you're a new listener or you know don't you know be
[02:01.960 --> 02:06.080]  against sex education of five-year-olds or you're a homophobe all of this
[02:06.080 --> 02:10.400]  distractionary stuff has just meant to bully people into submitting to the
[02:10.400 --> 02:18.240]  social engineering meanwhile you have the modern Democratic Party's roots and
[02:18.240 --> 02:24.240]  the Republicans to a certain extent but the facts are in facts are facts the
[02:24.240 --> 02:29.480]  Democratic Party has destroyed the black community for all intents and
[02:29.480 --> 02:33.040]  purposes from what it was and they're doing the same thing to every other
[02:33.040 --> 02:42.240]  group if you look at people as groups and so our reporters are out there both as
[02:42.240 --> 02:47.000]  political activists to try to save lives try to educate folks about what's
[02:47.000 --> 02:55.800]  happening in the hijacked George Soros's White House Justice Department meme that
[02:56.640 --> 03:02.560]  the only social injustice in America is militarized police shooting unarmed
[03:02.560 --> 03:08.400]  black men in the back and it is an important issue but one that the feds
[03:08.400 --> 03:15.680]  are driving towards confrontation not towards fixing it and so that's why
[03:15.680 --> 03:22.760]  we're going to be covering all of this and more today I specifically also want
[03:22.760 --> 03:32.040]  to open the phones up on Monday I shot a video after I did the radio show and
[03:32.040 --> 03:39.360]  when I was just having a lot of anxiety which I never really have about the
[03:39.360 --> 03:45.920]  state of the world and about big developments going on both seen and
[03:45.920 --> 03:51.400]  unseen and basically most people I talked to have said that they are feeling
[03:51.400 --> 03:55.120]  disquieted they're having anxiety they're worried about the state of the
[03:55.120 --> 04:01.200]  world Dr. Group walked in a couple days ago hadn't even heard the show hadn't
[04:01.200 --> 04:06.000]  seen that video and was telling the crew the same thing and they said don't you
[04:06.000 --> 04:13.520]  know about Alex's video so are you seeing more signs that the globalists are on
[04:13.520 --> 04:23.720]  the move and is that causing you to have a six sense to watch your six or is it
[04:23.720 --> 04:28.880]  just that we're becoming more aware of the marinade of tyranny the the ocean
[04:28.880 --> 04:33.760]  of the humanization that's going on and so it's humanity awakening that we're
[04:33.760 --> 04:39.200]  all picking up on or is everything fine and I'm just being paranoid we should
[04:39.200 --> 04:44.040]  all go back to sleep I'd like to hear from you first time callers in the first

[05:33.040 --> 05:37.960]  possibilities that the entire list has been completely fabricated in an effort

[08:37.360 --> 08:43.480]  having live updates from a demonstration at the Central Texas headquarters of the
[08:43.480 --> 08:51.040]  eugenicist organization that advised Adolf Hitler Planned Parenthood we're
[08:51.040 --> 08:56.560]  going to be talking about how all black lives matter and how the war against the
[08:56.560 --> 09:00.960]  police that the feds and the globalists are trying to start is actually a plan
[09:00.960 --> 09:05.240]  to divert and distract from the dehumanization extermination program
[09:05.240 --> 09:11.040]  being carried out against blacks in this country we'll get updates at the
[09:11.040 --> 09:16.680]  bottom of the hour each hour and we have the big graphics up on info wars calm
[09:16.680 --> 09:22.920]  of Margaret Sanger at the Ku Klux Klan rallies being worshiped and I mean
[09:22.920 --> 09:29.760]  literally worshiped they would put her up on the stage surround her and then do
[09:29.760 --> 09:38.440]  the Hitler salutes just just on their figurative knees quote we don't want the
[09:38.440 --> 09:43.560]  word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population Margaret
[09:43.560 --> 09:53.640]  Sanger 1939 in a letter to the Procter and Gamble Foundation so there you go
[09:53.640 --> 09:58.680]  and where you've got I think we printed up like 50 big signs and we're going to
[09:58.680 --> 10:02.000]  be handing them out to folks so get over there if you're listening in Central
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.920]  Texas right now you really want to expose what's happening and it's bigger
[10:05.920 --> 10:10.840]  than just abortion you can even say your for abortion what about the targeting
[10:10.840 --> 10:16.320]  and the pushing on a group and and then I see comments on info wars calm and on
[10:16.320 --> 10:20.840]  YouTube videos about it a meme saying then you pay for the black people's
[10:20.840 --> 10:25.280]  school you pay for their welfare you pay for their medical you pay you pay you
[10:25.280 --> 10:30.440]  pay I love how they collectivize things on the so-called left really just you
[10:30.440 --> 10:35.720]  genesis they take a community that had almost no illegitimacy very low crime
[10:35.720 --> 10:41.920]  rates and wreck it to the model of the world when it comes to the highest
[10:41.920 --> 10:48.240]  crime rates highest illegitimacy dying young prison population I mean they
[10:48.240 --> 10:55.360]  have wrecked the black community in this country wreck them and by the way the
[10:55.360 --> 10:59.640]  same socialist policies in Europe is taking white areas and just turned them
[10:59.640 --> 11:06.240]  into the exact same thing selling thug culture you name it it is psychological
[11:06.240 --> 11:09.960]  warfare and what was perfected on the blacks is now being deployed against
[11:09.960 --> 11:17.440]  everybody it is a fact that Margaret senior gave awards to Hitler got awards
[11:17.440 --> 11:23.880]  from Hitler it is a fact that our entire modern world and modern liberalism is
[11:23.880 --> 11:30.120]  totalitarianism in the name of social justice to cover right under the surface
[11:30.120 --> 11:38.040]  the vicious anti-human activities that are going on by this death wing you've
[11:38.040 --> 11:41.320]  got the life wing of this world you got the death wing of this world and they
[11:41.320 --> 11:46.640]  are the legion of death they are the wing of death
[11:46.640 --> 11:56.320]  they are the wings of rage and an anti-human bloodlust that that these
[11:56.320 --> 12:05.000]  these wicked devils soaring to the sky on it is over the top and we now see
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.840]  looks like there's already about 20 people out there so from the earlier
[12:09.840 --> 12:15.280]  shots I saw put another shot up on screen we'll talk to Jacarie Jackson and
[12:15.280 --> 12:19.480]  others that are out there when we come back and there's already some other
[12:19.480 --> 12:23.800]  good pro-lifers out there exposing what's happening but we've got signs for
[12:23.800 --> 12:28.640]  you and we're just trying to get other people around the country to start this
[12:28.640 --> 12:33.320]  hijacking of Black Lives Matter that is openly run by George Soros and the
[12:33.320 --> 12:37.040]  White House and the Justice Department so that we don't really reform the police
[12:37.040 --> 12:42.560]  we have the feds reform them by federalizing them completely and making
[12:42.560 --> 12:49.880]  them 10 times worse and that's the words of an analyst in the USA today that said
[12:49.880 --> 12:58.400]  let's get into the news there is so much to get into here on the economic
[12:58.400 --> 13:04.200]  affront more economists are warning of total collapse we're gonna be getting
[13:04.200 --> 13:11.520]  into that talking about the 45 trillion in future obligations we have the 19
[13:11.520 --> 13:16.560]  trillion that is now our national debt and then the separate 2 plus quadrillion
[13:16.560 --> 13:20.040]  that have been created by the central banks so they could buy up the world
[13:20.040 --> 13:25.720]  that they have now bound us to that is not our debt and that when the bubble
[13:25.720 --> 13:32.680]  burst and it will and when they have the cascade of bubbles popping they can be
[13:32.680 --> 13:39.160]  triggered by a war and triggered by another popping of a dot-com bubble
[13:39.160 --> 13:43.520]  which is due to happen with Silicon Valley it could happen for a race riots
[13:43.520 --> 13:46.760]  this summer that the White House is desperately trying to foam it and most
[13:46.760 --> 13:50.680]  analysts are saying will probably happen to some degree this summer I mean look
[13:50.680 --> 13:55.160]  what's already happening it's not even hot yet we don't know what's going to
[13:55.160 --> 13:59.960]  trigger it and I pray it doesn't happen but it's like praying grandpa in the
[13:59.960 --> 14:03.760]  hospital doesn't die when he's 90 years old just had surgery I mean you know he's
[14:03.760 --> 14:09.440]  gonna die the only question is is this month or two years from now but when
[14:09.440 --> 14:13.080]  this sucker goes down no amount of armored vehicles no amount of
[14:13.080 --> 14:16.440]  paramilitary police is gonna stabilize things because we just don't have the
[14:16.440 --> 14:20.840]  industry we don't have the food production capacity anymore we don't have
[14:20.840 --> 14:28.800]  the moral fiber anymore and out of this global meltdown they will form their
[14:28.800 --> 14:36.560]  planetary government with the carbon taxes that the Pope's calling for man
[14:36.560 --> 14:41.760]  this new Pope of all the popes I've seen I mean he is just a Marxist no other
[14:41.760 --> 14:46.480]  way to look at it and everybody knows I'm not a Catholic basher I mean you
[14:46.480 --> 14:50.280]  tune into mainline then a costal preachers are telling the government
[14:50.280 --> 14:57.560]  line and spewing a bunch of ecumenical garbage as well but I tell you man over
[14:57.560 --> 15:03.200]  the top to see the things that are happening the Pope calling for global
[15:03.200 --> 15:08.760]  carbon taxes as if that's wealth redistribution that's a tax on human
[15:08.760 --> 15:12.600]  development human activity ignoring all the real environmental issues look at
[15:12.600 --> 15:23.080]  this headline feds spent 100 billion on food assistance last year 100 billion
[15:23.080 --> 15:32.240]  dollars that's electronic soup kitchen lines with 109 million people I've
[15:32.240 --> 15:35.240]  always gone the number of 100 million I don't know 109 people always send me
[15:35.240 --> 15:39.680]  emails going it's not 100 million it's 49 million on food stamps that's one
[15:39.680 --> 15:46.280]  federal program so the Washington Free Beacon Congressional Budget Office and
[15:46.280 --> 15:56.960]  others to put the numbers out it's 100 billion for 109 million Americans
[15:56.960 --> 16:04.120]  ladies and gentlemen that's how you enslave a people and they're just
[16:04.120 --> 16:07.720]  accelerating getting rid of our jobs not having any contracts here
[16:07.720 --> 16:14.800]  domestically we can't even build our new railways here we have to buy it made in
[16:14.800 --> 16:19.160]  China shipped over and then Chinese firms that's in the news today are the
[16:19.160 --> 16:25.240]  ones actually that are gonna build it but I guess that's happened before I guess
[16:25.240 --> 16:32.160]  J.P. Morgan and the Astors and the Rockefellers when they were building the
[16:32.160 --> 16:36.160]  railroads they didn't want to use American labor either they would ship in
[16:36.160 --> 16:41.600]  Cooley's I think they called them and work them to death and then they blame
[16:41.600 --> 16:48.480]  the general white man like like he was all behind it again no no China was a
[16:48.480 --> 16:52.560]  colonial holding of the West at that time divided up by the Western Powers
[16:52.560 --> 16:58.160]  the French the Brits the Dutch the Americans you name it the Germans the
[16:58.160 --> 17:06.480]  Austrians and they just shipped them over here basically as slaves so I guess
[17:06.480 --> 17:10.120]  that's just the way it always is the more things change the more they stay the
[17:10.120 --> 17:12.280]  same
[17:14.280 --> 17:20.280]  I want to get into Rand Paul right now as we get ready to go out to break with the
[17:20.280 --> 17:26.840]  opening statement but now the good news is AP reports that it's in trouble the
[17:26.840 --> 17:33.200]  reauthorization of the Patriot Act is in trouble that's tied to the NSA and then
[17:33.200 --> 17:37.000]  we'll come back with his detractors and the baloney they're putting out here is
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.160]  the intro of his 10-hour historic filibuster yesterday mr. president the
[17:42.160 --> 17:48.640]  center from Kentucky there comes a time there comes a time in the history of
[17:48.640 --> 17:56.320]  nations when fear and complacency allow power to accumulate and liberty and
[17:56.320 --> 18:03.120]  privacy to suffer that time is now and I will not let the Patriot Act the most
[18:03.120 --> 18:09.760]  unpatriotic of acts go unchallenged at the very least we should debate we
[18:09.760 --> 18:14.280]  should debate whether or not we are going to relinquish our rights or whether
[18:14.280 --> 18:19.640]  or not we are going to have a full and able debate over whether or not we can
[18:19.640 --> 18:23.840]  live within the Constitution or whether or not we have to go around the
[18:23.840 --> 18:31.360]  Constitution the bulk collection of all Americans phone records all of the time
[18:31.360 --> 18:38.080]  is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment the second appeals court has
[18:38.080 --> 18:45.760]  ruled it illegal the president began this program by executive order he should
[18:45.760 --> 18:51.720]  immediately end it through executive order for over a year now he has said
[18:51.720 --> 18:58.120]  the program is illegal and yet he does nothing he says well Congress can get
[18:58.120 --> 19:02.560]  rid of the Patriot Act Congress can get rid of the bulk collection and yet he
[19:02.560 --> 19:08.200]  has the power to do it at his fingertips he began this illegal program the court
[19:08.200 --> 19:14.240]  has informed him that the program is illegal he has every power to stop it
[19:14.240 --> 19:21.800]  and yet the president does nothing just as Brandeis wrote that the right to be
[19:21.800 --> 19:27.840]  left alone is the most cherished of rights most prized among civilized men
[19:27.840 --> 19:34.560]  the fourth amendment incorporates this right to privacy the fourth amendment
[19:34.560 --> 19:41.440]  incorporates this right to be left alone when we think about the bulk

[24:05.680 --> 24:24.760]  because there's a war on for your mind
[24:24.760 --> 24:29.400]  all right we're gonna go back and finish up the opening remarks of Rand Paul
[24:29.400 --> 24:35.680]  which is very moderately put very reasonable hey we should have a debate
[24:35.680 --> 24:40.560]  about being beyond 1984 we don't even have a debate can we just debate and
[24:40.560 --> 24:45.920]  admit these illegal programs and the response of course by the media is
[24:45.920 --> 24:50.600]  there are no illegal programs none of this is happening just like they deny
[24:50.600 --> 24:54.480]  everything else even when it's admitted remember what Gibbs the White House
[24:54.480 --> 24:59.520]  press secretary said he was ordered to say that the drone program didn't exist
[24:59.520 --> 25:07.400]  when it was publicly admitted to exist the drone assassination program this is
[25:07.400 --> 25:14.040]  what they do they lie so let's go back and have him finish that opening statement
[25:14.040 --> 25:19.680]  we're gonna play with Congressman Peter King had to say you might ask well maybe
[25:19.680 --> 25:24.200]  I'm willing to give up my freedom for security maybe if I just give up a little
[25:24.200 --> 25:29.600]  freedom I'll be more safe well most of the information that comes on whether
[25:29.600 --> 25:34.280]  you're safe or not comes from people who have secret information that you're not
[25:34.280 --> 25:39.320]  allowed to look at so you have to trust the people you have to trust those in
[25:39.320 --> 25:44.000]  our intelligence community that they're being honest with you that when they
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.960]  tell you how important these programs are and that you must give up your
[25:47.960 --> 25:52.600]  freedoms you must give up part of the Fourth Amendment when they tell you this
[25:52.600 --> 25:58.960]  you have to trust them the problem is is that we're having a great deal of
[25:58.960 --> 26:05.960]  difficulty trusting these people that's right and of course they lied to us
[26:05.960 --> 26:14.120]  about WMD's in Iraq Saudi Arabia was involved in 9-11 that's been proven
[26:14.120 --> 26:21.160]  bare minimum and we attack their enemy instead and now have given a third of
[26:21.160 --> 26:27.160]  Iraq and two-thirds of Syria basically now is in the control of ISIS in fact
[26:27.160 --> 26:30.040]  they just announced today that ISIS is it looks like gonna go ahead and take
[26:30.040 --> 26:34.440]  over Syria probably notice they were losing a year ago but went into Iraq
[26:34.440 --> 26:44.440]  got resupplied accidentally getting all the US and NATO weapons accidentally and
[26:44.440 --> 26:51.840]  then now they're taken over so see all the surveillance all the spine and al-Qaeda
[26:51.840 --> 26:56.240]  has morphed into something 50 times bigger than it was hundreds of thousands
[26:56.240 --> 27:03.680]  strong allowed to recruit in the West and Peter King the neocon rhino monster
[27:03.680 --> 27:08.880]  comes out and attacks the senator Paul and basically says that he's fear
[27:08.880 --> 27:16.480]  mongering and that none of this is going on let's go to Peter King I strongly
[27:16.480 --> 27:21.120]  disagree with Rand Paul I think the NSA is essential I think that the NSA
[27:21.120 --> 27:24.000]  first of all I know they're not listening to anyone's phone calls or reading
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.600]  anyone's emails what they do is they store collections of phone numbers and so
[27:29.600 --> 27:33.240]  if you find out that an American has been speaking to a terrorist overseas that
[27:33.240 --> 27:37.200]  that then the Justice Department goes to court to get a court order the fact is
[27:37.200 --> 27:40.960]  that the NSA was in no one's at all I just collect this information it's
[27:40.960 --> 27:45.320]  essential to our security I think Rand Paul is wrong I agree with Mitch Mitch
[27:45.320 --> 27:49.160]  McConnell I think the law should have been extended as it is I voted for the
[27:49.160 --> 27:52.240]  bill in the house because that's the only one we can get through but I think
[27:52.240 --> 27:56.840]  senator Paul was doing a disservice to the country when you stop by there you
[27:56.840 --> 28:01.360]  have the DEA for 20 years recording phone calls tracking who you call
[28:01.360 --> 28:05.440]  creating phone trees without warrant and then creating fake cases to go to court
[28:05.440 --> 28:13.840]  to then build a fraudulent prosecution and it's on record they've been
[28:13.840 --> 28:18.080]  recording eight out of ten phone calls for at least five years it all got
[28:18.080 --> 28:23.240]  released by Snowden but we already know that in a handful of cases when they're
[28:23.240 --> 28:26.880]  going to go ahead with the prosecution they go out and then get the warrant
[28:26.880 --> 28:31.880]  later to go back and reverse engineer it but it's not pointed at terrorist it's
[28:31.880 --> 28:35.760]  pointed at Congress who they admit they've been spying on and notice King
[28:35.760 --> 28:40.560]  says we need the NSA no one ever said that we don't need an intelligence
[28:40.560 --> 28:45.320]  agency that spies on foreign governments in this world we don't need it
[28:45.320 --> 28:49.000]  aimed at us and backdoored into everything so everything they do is a
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.760]  misrepresentation it's the same talking point here's senator Marco Rubio last
[28:52.760 --> 28:57.880]  week saying there is no spying and there is no Atlantic Ocean here it is the
[28:57.880 --> 29:01.960]  perception has been created including by political figures that serve in this
[29:01.960 --> 29:05.320]  chamber that the United States government is listening to your phone
[29:05.320 --> 29:09.400]  calls or going through your bills on them as a matter of course that is
[29:09.400 --> 29:14.760]  absolutely categorically false the next time that any politician senator
[29:14.760 --> 29:18.840]  congressman talking head whatever it may be stands up and says that the US
[29:18.840 --> 29:22.120]  government is listening to your phone calls or going through your phone
[29:22.120 --> 29:29.160]  records they're lying it just is not true except for some very isolated
[29:29.160 --> 29:33.560]  instances oh yeah hundreds of individuals for whom there is reasonable
[29:33.560 --> 29:37.960]  suspicion that they could have links to terrorism really always have trouble
[29:37.960 --> 29:42.640]  pronouncing his name but I like he was an actor Shay LaBeouf before all the
[29:42.640 --> 29:47.880]  Snowden stuff came out remember he was on the set of GoldenEye in 2009 and the
[29:47.880 --> 29:51.080]  FBI admitted to him they recorded everything he said they played a clip
[29:51.080 --> 29:57.800]  back Alex it's all stored GCN radio network it's all illegal
[30:01.400 --> 30:06.440]  the hashtag black lives matter is being used by demonstrators all across the
[30:06.440 --> 30:10.840]  country but why should it be capped with the actions of police what if it was
[30:10.840 --> 30:14.760]  expanded to include another area where lives are being lost
[30:14.760 --> 30:19.240]  abortion it wasn't that long ago that new york reported it had more black

[33:52.920 --> 33:56.120]  out there exposing that planned parenthood was founded
[33:56.120 --> 33:59.800]  by the rockefeller foundation the keiserville home institute
[33:59.800 --> 34:05.240]  helped create the hitler movement we have the photos of margaret singer
[34:05.240 --> 34:08.840]  addressing the kuklax clan i'm sick of the so-called
[34:08.840 --> 34:12.680]  left these these these fascist these anti-human people
[34:12.680 --> 34:16.680]  claiming that they're liberals thomas jefferson was a liberal you're not
[34:16.680 --> 34:22.360]  you are a fraud and so i'm watching the feed during the break
[34:22.360 --> 34:27.320]  and i go look those are people with black signs blocking
[34:27.320 --> 34:30.760]  the families out there with their signs against abortion
[34:30.760 --> 34:33.880]  and the fact that half the black people in the country are exterminated and they
[34:33.880 --> 34:39.160]  come with big black tarps guaranteed they're gonna say they're anarchist
[34:39.160 --> 34:41.560]  but then they'll tell you they love lennon i haven't even talked to them yet
[34:41.560 --> 34:45.400]  and then they go and try to cover the signs up
[34:45.400 --> 34:48.840]  so no one can and these aren't signs pictures of dead babies by the way and
[34:48.840 --> 34:52.680]  that's your first amendment uh these are
[34:52.680 --> 34:57.560]  signs that simply show margaret singer with a kuklax clan
[34:57.560 --> 35:01.960]  and her quotes from the university archives
[35:02.520 --> 35:06.680]  and these people have black tarps putting them up in front so that so that
[35:06.680 --> 35:11.160]  the passing cars can't see it this is how dumb the followers of sauron
[35:11.160 --> 35:15.000]  are is that they think it makes them look good
[35:15.000 --> 35:18.840]  to be trying to censor when we're talking to three million people
[35:18.840 --> 35:23.160]  right now on the radio over 170 a m and f of affiliates
[35:23.160 --> 35:26.200]  five million views every few days on youtube
[35:26.200 --> 35:31.480]  live feeds with about 200 000 people last time i checked
[35:31.480 --> 35:35.720]  watching our live video feed you're not stopping anything
[35:35.720 --> 35:38.360]  and by the way this is about 10 minutes from where i'm at i'm tempted to have
[35:38.360 --> 35:41.880]  david night come in here and take over and i think that's david night's wife
[35:41.880 --> 35:45.480]  out there that is david night's wife with them
[35:45.480 --> 35:49.240]  trying to block her either david night's gonna have to go down there
[35:49.240 --> 35:51.640]  or i'm gonna have to get him in here and i'm gonna have to go down there because
[35:51.640 --> 35:55.240]  because and by the way we need to push it with these
[35:55.240 --> 35:59.560]  people they don't have a right to get in people's faces and block their signs
[35:59.560 --> 36:02.840]  that violates the first amendment and the police need to be called down there

[41:30.360 --> 41:34.360]  of view on a sign put it out there you have different views out there but the
[41:34.360 --> 41:38.200]  the mindset of the left or the authoritarians or the

[43:37.960 --> 43:42.440]  mainly black and brown so it was they had a
[43:42.440 --> 43:45.560]  basically a curiosity if he's aware of the history of planned parenthood they

[44:09.480 --> 44:12.920]  do okay and um and was trying to explain to
[44:12.920 --> 44:16.360]  this all ties into the what's going on with the race relations
[44:16.360 --> 44:20.120]  there's a bigger underlying issue that's going on that a lot of people in
[44:20.120 --> 44:24.360]  america are not aware of and it's it's religious and spiritual in nature
[44:24.360 --> 44:27.000]  all right we'll talk we'll talk to him more later jacari we got to move around

[47:44.680 --> 47:48.040]  a black lives matter event and they're starting around the country we didn't
[47:48.040 --> 47:50.760]  even know the reverend shoulders was already doing it before we were
[47:50.760 --> 47:54.360]  pointing out that focusing on cops shooting a few black people in the back
[47:54.360 --> 47:58.360]  is a diversion by the globalist from their larger plan doubling black
[47:58.360 --> 48:00.600]  unemployment exterminating blacks bringing in
[48:00.600 --> 48:06.120]  temporal populations to displace this is all part of divide and conquer
[48:06.120 --> 48:09.880]  everyone knows this everyone knows that every major white supremacist site
[48:09.880 --> 48:13.240]  hates me everyone knows that i am enemy number one
[48:13.240 --> 48:16.360]  because i'm bringing people together against the globalist and the southern
[48:16.360 --> 48:20.200]  poverty law center and adl have worked hard from behind the scenes to make
[48:20.200 --> 48:24.120]  sure that the nazi leadership tries to take control of that movement
[48:24.120 --> 48:27.880]  so that it can then be demonized and stop and not have a big tent
[48:27.880 --> 48:33.000]  we're here to bring everybody together and so now the police are out there
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.000]  because these these these these rodentia are
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.680]  are i mean look at this guy with his butt hanging out
[48:40.680 --> 48:44.280]  and then he's got his girlfriend or whoever she is out there
[48:44.280 --> 48:47.720]  literally just like a piranha that hates our guts that i'm
[48:47.720 --> 48:52.680]  anti-woman well the uncomfortable truth is that their founder the founder of
[48:52.680 --> 48:56.760]  plant parenthood margaret sanger has had numerous quotes about how this is
[48:56.760 --> 49:00.040]  about eugenics and one of them that's on one of the signs out there
[49:00.040 --> 49:03.800]  says that uh what she said about the inferior races is that they have a
[49:03.800 --> 49:07.720]  choice segregation or sterilization
[49:07.720 --> 49:11.880]  they have a so we're exposing the goddess of the kuklux klan
[49:11.880 --> 49:16.040]  and so we're bad and it's 201 east bend white plenty of parking
[49:16.040 --> 49:19.240]  south austin get over there in in the face of these people
[49:19.240 --> 49:22.280]  that want to destroy the first amendment they want to black out the truth
[49:22.280 --> 49:25.720]  they don't want to have a discussion of this they want to hide those quotes from
[49:25.720 --> 49:28.520]  margaret sanger they want to hide what they're about
[49:28.520 --> 49:31.800]  that's why they get out there with black signs and try to put them in front of
[49:31.800 --> 49:35.160]  other people's signs
[49:35.160 --> 49:39.640]  but i mean this woman couldn't even she just said he hates women he hates blacks
[49:39.640 --> 49:43.080]  f alex jones that's why we had to delay it out for radio stations out there and
[49:43.080 --> 49:45.720]  had to cut the feed because they were cussing so much
[49:45.720 --> 49:48.760]  because after a while the delay doesn't work is let it build back up for like a
[49:48.760 --> 49:51.720]  minute i mean this is insane what's going on
[49:51.720 --> 49:56.600]  in austin texas we're simply there exposing that the globalist could care
[49:56.600 --> 50:00.040]  less about anybody and blacks were the beta test
[50:00.040 --> 50:04.120]  this is coming down on everybody yes and so i'm so sick of the left saying
[50:04.120 --> 50:07.240]  you pay for the black babies you pay for the welfare they're the ones that put
[50:07.240 --> 50:11.000]  them on welfare and did all this to dehumanize them to make them
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.520]  domesticated and then they say now let's kill them it's like kill the old
[50:14.520 --> 50:18.440]  people with the uh death panels and don't give the
[50:18.440 --> 50:21.800]  veterans care you know we don't have enough money once they collectivize
[50:21.800 --> 50:25.720]  things then they get everybody used to basically cutting off the weakest
[50:25.720 --> 50:29.400]  no we build economies around quality around innovation
[50:29.400 --> 50:33.720]  and around taking care of our least that's how this works that's how you
[50:33.720 --> 50:37.880]  build an economy they're losing the argument we're gonna skip this we're
[50:37.880 --> 50:41.320]  gonna skip this break i'm sorry david go ahead they're losing the argument so
[50:41.320 --> 50:45.160]  they want to shut down speech they know they can't win this argument
[50:45.160 --> 50:49.640]  and and so that's a perfect visual metaphor for what this group is about
[50:49.640 --> 50:53.480]  and every day every day exactly perfect art type
[50:53.480 --> 50:58.120]  every day they're in the news trying to ban free speech trying to shut down
[50:58.120 --> 51:03.080]  speech they are totalitarian rats with idiot moron
[51:03.080 --> 51:07.080]  followers uh who and whenever they say anything
[51:07.080 --> 51:12.040]  all they say is racist sexist you're bad they don't ever back it up with anything
[51:12.040 --> 51:15.560]  and you'll point out right here they're just putting the their signs in front
[51:15.560 --> 51:19.480]  of everybody else because they don't have anything that they can say to
[51:19.480 --> 51:22.200]  support their case all right guys be on that delay be ready
[51:22.200 --> 51:25.640]  for our FCC rules no cussing let's fade up audio see what was

[51:55.800 --> 52:00.760]  it's about being respectful it's about honoring people's lives man

[54:08.760 --> 54:12.440]  you know what that what that is there's a pamphlet that's put out by

[55:29.400 --> 55:32.360]  you know alex i want to say something about this guy talking about trying to
[55:32.360 --> 55:35.800]  move this away to the global area we have to start understanding

[55:39.320 --> 55:42.600]  individual basis well he was at the local level well he was projecting

[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:44.440]  we don't have any any white babies for adoption
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:47.560]  and uh but we do have black babies so that's fine we'll we'll adopt a black
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.680]  baby we don't care and they said no we won't allow that
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:54.680]  my wife called the north carolina uh children's home and they said
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:58.280]  we don't adopt children out of here what would we do with the orphanage if we
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.000]  adopted our kids out and they always say when i've been a
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.240]  planned parent of demonstrations mainly racist blacks concern people they say
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:09.400]  nobody wants these black babies yeah uh and the truth is there's more people
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.720]  wanting to adopt black babies than there are black babies being killed
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.760]  and then that would be a way to get people socially mobile would be to get
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.800]  them out of some of these you know bad inner city cultures and help them but
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:24.280]  no no no we can't have that and your story is biblical
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.840]  about how you ought to tell it sometime or do a whole piece on it and have your
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:30.440]  wife in how you couldn't have kids but then once you adopted she got pregnant
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.760]  yeah oh absolutely and and the thing is is that we had tried going to different
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.440]  countries i mean the people who are out there who are my parents adopted
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.160]  yeah yeah exactly the people who would like to adopt kids
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.600]  they're not hung up on this this whole thing about hair color or skin color
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.240]  whatever they don't really care they'll go to ramania they'll go to china they'll
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.640]  go to south korea but then what happens is
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.320]  they'll be an easing in a particular country and then they will shut that
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:57.160]  down because they'll get embarrassed that their kids are being taken care of by
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.880]  americans who are coming there to adopt their kids so they'll shut the whole
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.600]  thing down because yeah there's been a ban on
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:06.440]  taking russian kids out uh but i mean look at her she's actually
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:10.200]  crying she's such a cult member and they won't say who they're with they just
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.480]  were all black which is fitting yeah executioners
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.760]  let's go to jacari jackson jacari uh what's happened
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:21.960]  since we've been uh talking the last few minutes uh there at the demonstration
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.720]  okay so things have really seemed to calm down by and large the officer
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.320]  kind of chilled everybody out but we still have people foreign against the
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:33.720]  cause but you know they're more peacefully coexisting at this moment
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:37.400]  and so this is the scene right now we have many more people
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.880]  how many people you think you're here man it's a lot more
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:47.160]  30 40 30 40 34 okay so 30 40 or so i think it's more like 50 or 60 because
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.680]  people are down the road there we need more people to get out there though
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:53.720]  especially with the first amendment being attacked and we always try to promote
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.600]  this three days ago so good job everybody
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.720]  that little girl was screaming earlier little girl was screaming earlier and
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.520]  she like they actually believe that we want the babies to live and the
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.560]  mothers to die yeah that's what she was screaming earlier
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.720]  they're just ignorant and they have no idea what they're talking about they
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.600]  don't understand that every time there's an abortion that happens the woman is
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.560]  six times more likely to have breast cancer my mother passed the breast
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.720]  cancer i'm not an anti-woman at all but it's just they're so ignorant they
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.440]  won't listen to you because they're just screaming racist in your face
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.760]  well that's pretty much what you know a lot of these guys that's all the
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.400]  argument is you know because guys like you guys hate black people i was like
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:28.440]  i was in ferguson where you know i got tear gas with people's first amendment
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:32.920]  rights but i kari i'm come on it's obvious that you hate black people every day
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.800]  in my life you know very good thank you sir
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.080]  so you know these are the most ridiculous arguments they have is like even
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.800]  if you're black they'll say that you hate black people if you're a woman they
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:45.320]  say that you hate women they have no argument or real basis
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:48.120]  absolutely jacari stay there i'm gonna come right back to you we got to go to
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.800]  break from the demonstration just illustrating what the pro-death
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.360]  side is like i mean i knew rats would show up
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:57.320]  like they even predicted to do i said the rat creatures will show up and they
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.600]  crawl out of a hole think you've got nothing to hide
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.960]  well a group of activists is challenging that mentality
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:08.760]  by placing hidden tape recorders throughout new york to protest the nsa
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:13.000]  the campaign called we are always listening is currently collecting
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.680]  private conversations of unsuspecting citizens and then
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:21.160]  uploading those intimate conversations online in an attempt to discredit that
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.200]  nothing to hide narrative the group's website says
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.280]  citizens don't seem to mind this monitoring so we're hiding recorders in
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.800]  public places in hopes of gathering information to
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:35.960]  help win the war on terror the site encourages those who are angry about
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:41.000]  surveillance to contact congress as section 215 of the patriot act reaches
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.600]  expiration on june 1st you can listen to some of those audio

[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:46.040]  right in the middle of the noon hour uh and uh there was a info wars magazine
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:50.040]  burning event by the communist action group as they call themselves
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:53.400]  we're scanning their facebook right now but it appears that's this group
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:58.280]  so see let me just immediately oh yeah i mean just immediately
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.920]  scum of the earth if that's them well their first choice alex is to
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:06.600]  completely block speech they don't let's recap the folks that joined us i forgot
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.560]  to do it tell us david what we're doing what's happening
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:13.240]  well we've got a a uh a demonstration there
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:17.560]  basically showing people the hypocrisy of the black lives matter that they're
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:21.080]  only concerned about what's going on with police brutality and we're
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.680]  concerned about that as well but we're also concerned about the black lives
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:29.160]  that have been destroyed by the millions since rovey wade with abortion
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:33.160]  and to point out that uh planned parenthood was started by margaret
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:37.880]  singer somebody who made it very clear that she was targeting the black
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:40.840]  population for extermination as part of her eugenics
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:44.200]  uh vision please bring my bullhorn and go ahead so uh that's that's why we're
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.880]  out there to to uh protest though and i had counter protesters who showed up if
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:52.600]  you could call them that they came out in black suits with black signs
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.240]  nothing on it they didn't want to exercise their free speech to try to
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:58.280]  convince people that abortion was fine that it was
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.320]  preferable they had nothing to say they wanted to stop
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.960]  our speech with the exception of one that i've seen
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:07.720]  who came out there and says alex jones is anti-woman and when you
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:10.840]  when jacari asked her she just said you're racist you're sexist
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:14.120]  absolutely please bring a bullhorn in i want to test it i know they've got one
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:17.240]  of my other bullhorns down there but just go ahead and bring it in studio
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:20.360]  so what they do is they use ad hominem attacks they use
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.480]  charges of racism and sexism that are unsupported
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:27.560]  but primarily they want to shut down other people's speech just
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.600]  black it out that's what they're doing with these signs that are out there
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:35.400]  keep going guys what they what we saw earlier and it's a perfect
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:39.400]  metaphor for the way they operate is and there's the uh
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:42.760]  there's the bullhorn you can hear in the background uh
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:46.680]  what they wanted to do was to shut down people's free speech and so
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:49.960]  we see them trying to hold black signs in front of other people's
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.560]  signs that have something written on them and of course it was a back and
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:56.520]  forth uh my wife and others were trying to put their
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:01.000]  signs lower and higher perfect metaphor for the way they operate again as i
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.760]  said it's either ad hominem attacks that are not supported
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:09.080]  or unsupported charges of racism and sexism
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:13.160]  and they have nothing to say primarily they just want to shut other people's
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:16.280]  free speech down yeah well i'm not going to shut their free
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:19.960]  speech down i'm going to go down there and really talk about what's going on
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:23.320]  you take over i'll be back by the third hour we'll open the phones up i got a
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.760]  ton of news over here we got ram poll clips we haven't gotten to yet

[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:34.440]  congressman saying there is no spying and ram poll's lying i mean this is just
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:38.680]  over the top what's going on but when you get
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.400]  scum of the earth i don't know what they are communist Easter bunnies whatever
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.920]  they are showing up spewing total lies and trying to
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:49.080]  shut down the first amendment it just shows don't they know how bad they look
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.480]  doing this on tv and radio right now
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:55.720]  oh it's a great photo op i'm glad they did it it is something that you can use
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:58.520]  it's what they did is actually a metaphor for the way they operate
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:01.560]  everywhere as you pointed out alex they try to shut down the internet
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.080]  they try to shut down free speech everywhere they go and here you can see
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:09.080]  it with people having signs then and they want to just take their black
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:15.160]  signs and hold it up over the other ones yeah well i'm coming rats

[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:42.680]  speech they don't want to make an argument for because what is your
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:47.880]  argument i gotta tell you that a turning point for me
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.320]  in terms of abortion i had bought the argument as a libertarian that this is
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.280]  just about people's choice we can't agree as to when life begins
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:57.640]  and it was what they call partial birth abortion that was really the turning
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.160]  point for me alex that was when i was uh it was actually i was
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.080]  doing a paper candidacy running for congress and people started asking me
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.040]  about partial birth abortion it was something that was new
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:11.880]  and when i understood what it was that they took a mature baby as rampall
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.040]  points out would you kill a seven pound baby
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.400]  it just comes right down to that and if the answer to that
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:24.680]  is true then you start to realize what's behind all this i had not understood
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.960]  what the eugenics agenda was i hadn't understood
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:32.600]  that uh that was really what was behind it i believe that another thing that is
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:37.320]  really woke waking people up is the idea that they can see these babies
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:42.440]  with what they call 4g ultrasound uh they 4d ultrasound they can
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:46.680]  look at the children they can see them moving inside the womb they can see
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.560]  facial expressions you've seen the national geographic
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:55.640]  specialist where they take uh unborn babies of elephants or dogs or
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:00.520]  other animals and you can look at the animal inside the mother you can make
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:05.560]  out the features you can see them moving uh that is something i think is a very
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:09.240]  very powerful thing that's what the lady was trying to do uh coming out there
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:12.280]  they do this on a regular basis they talk to people who are considering
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.800]  abortion and they say do you understand that this is a mature child
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.840]  that you may be killing do you understand there are people out there
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:25.560]  who would willingly adopt this child and give it a life it's not going to be a
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.760]  financial responsibility for it at the same time
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:32.520]  Planned Parenthood is trying to tell people that this child is going to cost
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:36.600]  you an incredible amount of money over your lifetime they say this is going to
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:40.840]  cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for you to raise this child
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:45.720]  that is projecting everything back from the future into the current
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:49.640]  it really isn't that much of a burden as we all know when you add an extra
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:53.080]  mouth to feed maybe you don't send the child to college
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:57.400]  maybe you don't make them a debt slave we haven't sent our kids to college we
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.640]  haven't encouraged them to go into debt for this
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.920]  there are certain majors that you might want to go into for college but you know
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:07.320]  for the most part having a child is not a financial
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:11.960]  burden for people it is a wonderful experience as a parent i would encourage
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:15.160]  everybody to have children adopt children do what you can that's what
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.280]  we're trying to get people to understand if they are in a position
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:22.360]  where they are a single individual they can't they're young they can't take
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:25.640]  care of this child understand that there are other people out there
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:29.000]  who are willing to do it for you that's the key thing to get people to
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.600]  understand that i don't know if we have jacari on the uh
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:36.440]  on the uh yeah we do okay jacari have you got somebody there you want to talk
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:39.160]  to

[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:47.320]  okay yes we're out here at the scene and we're going to move around a little

[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.440]  telephone poles the bank just called they
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.600]  don't want you on the property so if you stay between the sidewalk and the
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.960]  telephone poles that way you're not blocking the sidewalk
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:09.640]  you're not bothering anybody else in the business very good sir otherwise go on
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:13.960]  do the good things thank you sir all right nice officer there so we'll try
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:17.000]  to stay compliant if anybody's going to come out here and join us make sure
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.520]  you stand between the sidewalk and the telephone poles if you see any
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:24.520]  pedestrians try to give them a little bit of space to move around and
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:28.440]  well you know jacari uh alex is on his way so he's going to be joining you uh
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:32.040]  that's going to be your job to try to keep him in the confined free speech area
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:35.880]  there that's the job i look forward to let's talk to your wife david
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:40.680]  okay all right uh come on come on in let's let's talk
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:44.440]  so no no no so do you have any questions that you're like to ask your
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:49.480]  your wife david yeah tell us about that guy trying to hide your sign karen
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.560]  okay so he says tell us about the guy who's trying to hide your sign
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:59.560]  well he was abusive verbally and i do have it on tape i sent it to you i don't
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:03.080]  know if you got it um
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:06.920]  i don't know what to tell you about i could see her holding her sign low when
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:09.480]  he would go high and high when he'd go low
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.840]  yes okay all right well thank you we'll keep moving around
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:17.000]  all right so as you can see uh most people are being compliant here the
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.720]  officer came in and look you can see this gentleman
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:26.200]  trying to hold up his sign and he's being blocked yeah by the tarp perfect
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:29.560]  example perfect example there's the metaphor for how the
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:33.720]  authoritarians want to shut down free speech they don't have anything to say
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:38.440]  they know they can't win the argument so they just want to shut your speech down
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.160]  they could make their own signs they could make their own arguments but
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.880]  instead they want to shut speech down because jacari they don't have a way to
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.680]  win this argument yeah all right now pete
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:52.280]  now pete now you've been out here for a while what do you think about it so far
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:56.760]  i love it i love it because man uh whether the attention is negative or
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:01.480]  positive man the lights on it the man the truth is being exposed
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:05.000]  and you're either gonna have to pick a side or get out the way man because you
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.720]  know what we got to defend the kids that's really why i came out here
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:13.480]  because man you know it's all the kids you know i mean
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:16.520]  because it's not just the black kids or the hispanic kids it's all the kids you
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:19.880]  know i want everybody's kids to have a chance in this world but we can't do
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:22.520]  that if we have all these planned parenthoods out here doing an abortion
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:26.360]  and they'll say to you that abortion is only one aspect of what planned
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.880]  parenthood does which okay fine but if they didn't have that one aspect nobody
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:33.160]  would be out here right now and you know on a spiritual level this is
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:36.680]  an attack on children and if we want to maintain the moral high ground
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:40.280]  then we have to stop this and we can't we cannot let this continue
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:45.320]  yeah that's good that's a real good point to make this is yes i'm sorry
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.960]  off direct okay well the officer is asking to talk to me off the record
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:52.680]  so if you guys will just uh give me a moment here
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:55.640]  okay so i guess well uh we'll take you off of the air right now you know what
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:58.680]  we were talking about how planned parenthood will
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.960]  come to the uh to the pregnant ladies and try to
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:06.520]  tell them how unaffordable it's going to be for them to have children but
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:09.240]  understand that when it comes to dollars and
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:12.600]  cents the abortion industry has probably has made
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:17.320]  about 27 trillion dollars off of this since roe v wade
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:21.560]  look at the 54 million children that have been killed with abortion
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:25.160]  multiply that out by the average cost of 500
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:29.320]  that's what i get is 27 trillion dollars it's big business
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:33.000]  it's about money for them but they also have a eugenics
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.520]  agenda that they think sets them apart from the rest
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:39.800]  they won't talk about that they will only hold up
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:44.040]  black signs in front of other people's signs that are explaining what's really
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:47.720]  going on here stay with us we're going to be right back you won't want to miss

[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:39.800]  is not directed only at black lives it's directed at
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:43.400]  everyone but as alex has pointed out they're the beta tests they're bearing
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.720]  the brunt of this and disproportionate numbers
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:50.120]  but if black lives matter and police brutality don't black lives matter in
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:54.280]  terms of abortion that's the whole point of this abortion has been
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:57.960]  disproportionately targeted towards the black community the founder of plan
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:01.800]  parenthood margaret sanger made it very clear that's why she was
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:06.040]  creating this to get rid of undesirable ethnic groups and she put black people
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:10.120]  in that category she famously said they have a choice
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.320]  these people they can we can either have segregation or we can have
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:17.960]  sterilization that's what this is about so we showed up to uh
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:22.840]  to protest the plan parenthood site and to use this black lives matter to get
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.880]  people to think more broadly about this and we had counter demonstrators and i
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.160]  use that term loosely because they showed up dressed in black
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:35.160]  carrying black signs and trying to hold them in front of the banners of the
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:38.280]  people who had shown up to protest they didn't have
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:42.120]  any speech that they wanted to counter they didn't have anything they wanted
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:46.280]  to say they just want to shut down your free speech
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:51.720]  a wonderful visual a wonderful metaphor for the way the authoritarians work
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:55.720]  typically the left understand too that most of these people who have been
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:58.760]  proclaiming themselves as pro-life for the last
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:03.560]  40 years are also the ones pro-choice i'm sorry not pro-life the ones who've been
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:06.440]  calling themselves pro-choice are the ones who are
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:12.360]  working the hardest to take away your informed consent trying to force
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:16.440]  vaccines on you on your family on your children
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:19.880]  they don't want freedom of choice they don't want
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.400]  freedom of speech you can see that in this demonstration where they show up
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:26.840]  and just try to cover up other people's signs and the only person who wrote
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:31.240]  anything on a sign it was to say that uh that info wars is
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:34.840]  anti-women and she had nothing to say except your
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:39.000]  sexist and your racist that's what we see if they ever say anything
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.600]  they just rehash those same old-tired
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:45.880]  clichés and they have become clichés and it's a shame
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:49.640]  because it really is racism out there and when they use it
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:54.040]  like that when they cry wolf that is what is really concerning
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:58.840]  uh jacari are you there yes i am tell us what you see right now at the
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:03.720]  site and jacari is on site there at the demonstration in front of plan parenth
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:07.160]  yes as you can see we're still out here in front of plan parenth we have several
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:09.880]  people out here now at least you know 50 60 or so
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:13.400]  we're staying over here because there's been a lot of uh profanity used
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.080]  over there uh amongst some of the others so we're trying to stay and have a clean
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:20.120]  feed but you know it's a pretty peaceful scene we had a chance to talk to one of
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.320]  the officers and i do have a correction for all the people who heard of what
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:27.960]  alex said earlier he gave the incorrect address this is 201 the 501
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:31.880]  address was actually the strip club down the street don't go to the strip club
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:36.200]  come up to the plan parenthood at 201 east bin white well you can't miss us
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:39.720]  you know you had you know the 50 60 hundred people out here
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:42.600]  yeah it's gonna be real hard to miss us if you're on bin white you're gonna see
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:46.200]  that because it's a large crowd of people even if you don't uh see the
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:50.680]  the plan parenthood sign absolutely yeah so uh come on out be peaceful the
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:54.760]  officers are requesting that we stand between the sidewalks in the telephone
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:57.960]  polls that's enough infringe on anybody's property not just
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:01.800]  the plan parenthood but there's also a bank and a windies so be respectful to
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:05.080]  them be respectful to their employees most definitely if they ask you to
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.960]  please step back just go ahead and do that because our fight isn't with the
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:12.120]  bank it's uh we're fighting against the uh the killing of our children it's not
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.000]  just black children and people say why black lives matter
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.960]  you know why do you want to take attention away from the police is
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:21.720]  it doesn't stop with the police yes that is an issue but we also understand
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:25.240]  that this is one of the biggest killers of black and our blacks in our country
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:28.360]  and it's the plan parenthood it's not just the blacks it's the white children
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:31.320]  and the brown children all the children david that's right just like police
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:36.280]  brutality it affects all races all uh all groups
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:40.840]  but it's important that people understand that this abortion industry was
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:44.920]  created specifically to target blacks with eugenics with
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:48.200]  genocide that's what they need to understand that's the point that we're
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:51.880]  trying to make and clearly you should understand if if you
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:55.640]  understand that blacks are being singled out and we saw that that clip that
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.760]  was that that surfaced this weekend of a
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:01.960]  open carry test they had a white guy with a
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:07.080]  rifle shoulder over on his shoulder and they had a black guy and they showed
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:11.320]  very graphically how the police reacted totally differently to the two
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.800]  individuals so we understand that there's an issue
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:17.320]  with the police we understand that black people are being targeted
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:20.840]  with that but we also need to understand that they are being targeted with plan
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:23.800]  parenthood go ahead chicari david we have a we have a gentleman here he has

[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:15.880]  suddenly shut their cars off while driving causing them to lose power
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:20.200]  steering and braking others claimed it fried their cars electronics

[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:51.160]  just the police brutality but it's also the direct eugenics agenda
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:55.320]  of planned parenthoods founder margaret sanger specifically targeting
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:58.360]  the black community we're trying to wake people up to that just before we went

[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:36.200]  free speech only shows them to be the flaming
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:40.120]  to vegetarians that they are but right now
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.720]  three million people are listening to us and millions more
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.720]  will watch the video hundreds of thousands see it now
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:54.600]  their attempt to silence free speech has failed
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:38:01.480]  the answer to their 1984 tyranny is 1776
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:09.080]  pro-human pro-liberty freedom is rising and it will never be silenced
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:13.320]  never as the enemy presses across the planet
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:16.280]  to silence humanities awakening it will only
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.480]  spindle greater fires of the hearts of men and women
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:25.080]  that will burn down the tyranny it is here it is a peaceful revolution of
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:28.920]  paradigm shift and i salute the infall warriors of every
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:34.760]  race color and clean across the globe
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:39.160]  margaret singer person of the year twice in time magazine
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:42.840]  they want to put her on the twenty dollar bill literally
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:49.640]  talk Hitler everything he knew and they do not want that information coming out
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:53.000]  well guess what yeah go ahead it is coming out
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.400]  guess what it is coming out and we are not going to be stopped
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:01.640]  from getting this information out we are going to continue
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:05.000]  to get all of this information out and we're never
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.600]  going to stop
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:14.120]  because the enemy climbed out from under a rock to come to this satanic
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:19.560]  temple of human sacrifice to protect their gods blood sacrifices
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:23.320]  it will now blow up in their face and be 10 times bigger
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:27.960]  when the headlines come out that socialist proof death scum
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:31.240]  try to censor the first amendment try to stop
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:44.040]  demonstrations he's live at the demonstration
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:48.120]  satanic temple that's exactly what it is and we're exposing it
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:51.240]  just like we were fighting the abortion at the capital
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:55.720]  and women stand around chanting hail satan it's a sacrament to kill their
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:58.520]  babies women that have been tricked and had
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:02.600]  abortions god forgives them and we're none of us are here to
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.560]  judge i have been involved in abortions when i was younger
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:09.480]  and i wish i never would have done it what matters is your heart
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:13.320]  and all those that love this system they love
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:17.160]  death and that's why the the the disciples of this
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:21.160]  always are the same and they have the same dead look in their eyes
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:25.240]  and they wear the same black robes as my pre-satanist
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:29.080]  because they are out here promoting this and they can't stand it
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:32.840]  and now because of their totalitarian evil
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:36.040]  everyone is seeing them here trying to shut down
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:41.480]  free speech imagine and thank god every day that we didn't crawl out from under
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:44.600]  rocks like the lowest forms of anti-human
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:48.760]  trash that dare to call themselves liberal when they are the
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:53.720]  literal scum of the planet is this the best the devil can offer
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:56.840]  is these weaklings is this the god of this world
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:00.040]  that everyone wants to serve to fall out to when the servants
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:03.400]  are worse than golem i'm telling you right now
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:07.400]  their whole system is destined from the foundations of this earth
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:12.600]  to fall and we stand with the innocence we stand with the truth
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:16.440]  we stand against the new world order and their
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:23.320]  1984 system will fall liberty and the awakening and the pro-human
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:29.400]  movement and the pro-life movement is rising
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:36.360]  90 plus percent of upa and fda scientists
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:40.520]  joined us in letters to their chief saying remove fluoride
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:44.200]  it's a chemical weapon to brain damage the people and the federal government
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:48.280]  has announced the beginning of the removal of the fluoride
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:51.800]  devastating victory devastating victory against death
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:56.680]  praise god for that huge victories life of sakes being soon
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:59.640]  shut down countries all over declaring it a cancer
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:03.400]  weapon we're winning that war when they said they couldn't be stopped
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:09.480]  no the people standing for truth and liberty are invincible
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:15.320]  that's sick of the weak devil wars that scum their filth
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:18.600]  and it's time for good people who have the real strength of life
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:24.280]  to stand up against this film right car you get in there get in there and let
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:27.560]  them know this is life at least black lives matter rally
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:32.440]  in front of them i bless your
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:35.880]  support because we have many people who don't want this message to get out there
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:39.080]  they choose not to speak when they are given the opportunity
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:42.040]  they just come out to you they kill them out to you if you're black they'll call
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:45.560]  you a racist if you're a woman they'll call you a sexist and that's all the
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.840]  argument you have but i think everybody who came out here today to
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:51.560]  support us thank you it's not you're supporting us
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:54.840]  you're supporting the lives of these children not just black children white
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:58.040]  children hispanic children yellow children all the children all around
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:00.840]  the world and it's not just when when you come out
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:03.560]  against the plant here and hope you come out against the police brutality it's
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:07.240]  everything they're doing to all of us so it's not one of us it's all of us
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:11.800]  together standing against this tyranny keep going chicory
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:17.160]  i guess alex blew out his voice back there they need to stop that's right
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:20.360]  that's right baby's in the dumpster that's right they're dehumanizing us

[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:28.120]  they're people tell us tell us they're not trash

[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:35.240]  which one's the provocateur

[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:52.120]  we go ahead you want to pick on the old cripple man that's not what happened

[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:06.360]  you're going to play at the plant parenthood control clinic and
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:09.160]  you know i guess we could call the clinic i really
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:13.480]  think it's the clinic that's what they call it you've been getting everybody's
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:19.080]  face since you got here you know what because people like you are mind control
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:23.240]  that's right we're trying to agree yeah I don't mean you're not mind control
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:25.720]  you out here you're out here for fuck the tour look what you're getting in
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:28.840]  everybody's face i'm pointin your finger in everybody's
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:32.280]  Hey, how many fingers you got pointing at you stop the fight?
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:40.080]  I just protect it free speech. All right. Well, that's the case then let's shut it down
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:45.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, the bottom line is where's the photo of Margaret Sanger with the Klan? Let's show folks that
[01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:49.380]  That's what that's what people need to understand
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:45:02.380]  Oh, yes, you want to talk? Are we all communist National Force tell us what it is. Tell us what it is. Tell us what it is. That's what I want to do is save the babies. I don't want to fight. I just want to save the babies.
[01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:10.380]  We're talking about human lives. You're sacrificing them. You got them inside the cage and they'll escape.
[01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:27.380]  If you're not going to have the moral high ground, if you keep killing these kids and if you're against the babies being killed, if you're for the babies being killed, then you're not going to survive this thing. You are not. If you're against babies, I feel bad for you.
[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:36.380]  That's how the enemy gets the heads of protection to be brought down. We feel our country becoming cursed. Now listen, you guys are out here trying to block people's free speech. Announce yourself.
[01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:48.380]  I'm just trying to promote free peace. I'm doing my free speech. I'm not trying to block people's signs. Exactly. You don't have anything but a black shroud of death to make sure nobody thinks about what's happening to those kids inside.
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:56.380]  I know he is. He's in favor of killing babies. Yeah, I know you guys are going to block our free speech. It's called abortion. You can't do that.
[01:45:56.380 --> 01:46:07.380]  He doesn't have an election. Whoever sent these guys out here, whatever, YouTube professor or whatever, told them don't talk because they're dumbered in a box of rocks. Says the guy they have.
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:20.380]  I have nothing to say to you, Alex Jones. That's why you're such a trendy. You're garbage. You're absolute garbage. Just like the babies. Guess what? My mother didn't kill me. I was born in 74. Yeah, you failed. You failed.
[01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:30.380]  Explain yourself. Hey, all those that hate God love death and you just enjoy your life, buddy. I'm glad you picked your side. You think that's okay?
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:38.380]  Half the black people never got born after 74. Do you think that's okay? I have nothing to say to you guys. You have nothing to say. There you go.
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:44.380]  Because they can't talk. They don't have anything to say. And Planned Parenthood was founded by the queen of the clan.
[01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:58.380]  Look at this. What's it say? Multi-death corporations. Hey, look, that's Planned Parenthood. Look at all the dead bodies right there. It's classic.
[01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:08.380]  But see, weak people get into death because they're subconsciously afraid of it. It's like a moth to flame. They fly towards it. They're not even conscious enough to realize why they revel in it.
[01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:17.380]  But then when they're all into death and all their motifs are death and what they produce is death, they then turn around and tell us that we're the bad people.
[01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:25.380]  It's absolutely unbelievable. But I want to... Look, I know you're trying to shut down free speech on the campuses, everywhere else, people like you, your spirit.
[01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:34.380]  And I'm glad you came out to show everybody who you are. You will save thousands of children now, bare minimum, as this goes viral with all black lives matter.
[01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:43.380]  No weapon formed against the so-prosper demon. Thank you so much for what you've done. All the promises are being fulfilled and they will continue to be fulfilled.
[01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:55.380]  I guarantee you, I'm telling you right now. It is unbelievable. I mean, I love how it's like a dead brown shroud. I guess they'd cover the babies with...
[01:47:55.380 --> 01:48:10.380]  I mean, it's just unbelievable. Just unbelievable. Imagine out here, even if you're for abortion, out here celebrating this death camp founded by Hitler's Queen.
[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:17.380]  I mean, this is unbelievable. I want to give David Knight a few minutes to speak. I don't have any audio. So, David Knight, you take a minute or two out. I'll cut back in a second.
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:30.380]  What we have seen here at this rally, and again, the reason that Alex Jones went there was because unknown to us, unexpected by us, we had a lot of people show up to supposedly counter the protesters there.
[01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:39.380]  They showed up with nothing except for black shrouds to put over the signs, talking and exposing about what's going on at Planned Parenthood.
[01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:47.380]  But we should have guessed it, I guess, because we've seen this before. When we went to cover a gun control rally at the Capitol...
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:49:10.380]  Go ahead and get back to Alex.
[01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:18.380]  So, you know, that's the point, that we're ignorant. People don't know what the word eugenics means, so they don't really know.
[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:28.380]  And then you have other people here trying to hide my signs, blocking my free speech. They're so intellectually vapid, they have nothing to say, so all they can do is cover my sign up.
[01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:34.380]  And I went up to him and said, hey, what do you got? Come at me, man. Come on, argue with me. How am I wrong? And they're just sitting there with a...
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:41.380]  I said, this guy's a clown. This Mr. Beard boy here holding up black papers. It's just a clown. Go up to him and talk to him about history, about philosophy.
[01:49:41.380 --> 01:49:45.380]  Well, listen, is this the best the New World Order can offer?
[01:49:45.380 --> 01:49:55.380]  It's just a vapid sense of my space, YouTube, Facebook. It's all about me. It's all this new meme that I'm smarter than you, I'm better than you, and it's like this...
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:50:04.380]  And they get off on, they get off on rashing healthcare to old people, to the veterans, to babies. Socialism, they get off on, well, they got to cut it off so we get more.
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:05.380]  It's just so stupid.
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:12.380]  Zero sum paradigm. It's a zero sum game. If I don't get it, then you're getting it from me. Instead of that we can collaborate and have synergy.
[01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:19.380]  No, it's all of this zero sum mentality. Instead of having a win-win situation, it's like, well, if you take money from them, then I'm not going to get it.
[01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:25.380]  I'm going to be against giving the people their pension funds, because that's going to, you know, exactly. It's pure crap. We can build whatever we want.
[01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:30.380]  We've got total potential. We're building the image of the creator. We're great builders. Look what we've done.
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:38.380]  And again, I'm ranting and raving here. Pretty fired up, David Knight. We may have skipped this network break. Houston, did we skip the break?
[01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:41.380]  No, we're still going. We're still going. We're coming up to the break and we're going to come right back.
[01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:47.380]  Okay, we skipped the break. I can't skip all of these, and that's what I bring us to now here. Okay, I'm going to move on down the road here.
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:53.380]  One moment. Yeah, we did skip the break. I was told that in my ear. Were we? Yes or no, guys?
[01:50:53.380 --> 01:51:00.380]  Okay, great. Thank you very much. Yes. Again, we're working this out. It's real news, real information, teleprompter free.
[01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:06.380]  And I heard cross talk there. I was trying to ascertain that for sure. We've gone an hour and 50 minutes into this transmission.
[01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:13.380]  I think we've already skipped three breaks. That'll cost the network and myself, because I have half the ads. That's part of my radio operation.
[01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:20.380]  Probably $10,000. So I just blew $10,000 today because I get so excited that I can't even go to break.
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:28.380]  That's why you need to support infowars.com, infowarslife, infowarsstore.com, because we are a warfare operation against the globalist.
[01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:33.380]  Just yesterday, I was looking at our accounting to see if I can even send reporters to Boulderburg this year.
[01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:39.380]  I know I could send Paul Watson, but I want to be able to send some of the other people. I'll be with you in a second, sir. Thanks for being here.
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:46.380]  And it is so important that people buy the t-shirts, the books, the videos, everything.
[01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:52.380]  It is so important, all of you, so that we can stand against the enemy, have the equipment, have the great crew,
[01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:58.380]  build this TV system to bring real truth to the planet, not just North America or the United States.
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:03.380]  So please go to infowarslife.com, the special 20% off SuperMail, Super Female Vitality.
[01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:10.380]  That is going to be ending this Sunday. We've got the Silver Bullet, all the other products, the great, high-quality water filtration systems.
[01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:15.380]  Everything we sell is the very best we can get to also have value, because it's about win-win.
[01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:19.380]  That same philosophy that Gabriel was just talking about.
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:23.380]  So I've gone an hour and 52 minutes now without midair refueling.
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:27.380]  We need you to fund our operation. We need you to pray for us. We need you to buy the products.
[01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:30.380]  We need you to spread the word about infowars.com.
[01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:33.380]  We need everybody to send a link right now to friends and family.
[01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:36.380]  infowars.com forward slash show for the free video feed.
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:40.380]  We need people to be prison-planet.tv members to see all the films and get the nightly news.
[01:52:40.380 --> 01:52:43.380]  That's subscription. That's about to launch on TV very, very soon.
[01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:46.380]  Big announcements coming soon on that front.
[01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:54.380]  And again, we see the pathetic enemy out here, like a bunch of jellyfish who are just soulless, dim-eyed,
[01:52:54.380 --> 01:53:01.380]  shark-eyed, great-white-eyed, dead vessels. They are sucked, dry, just mindless idiots
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:05.380]  who hate life and hate freedom and hate free speech.
[01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:10.380]  In fact, CJ's looking into it, but we believe this is the same group that had a Facebook thing
[01:53:10.380 --> 01:53:13.380]  burning my magazines a month ago.
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:18.380]  And I mean, this is just incredible how totalitarian these types of groups and affiliated groups are.
[01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:23.380]  And they won't even say who they are. It is simply over the top.
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:26.380]  And that's what we stand against. And every time we stand against the enemy,
[01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:31.380]  every time we speak out against them, whether it's TPP or whatever the globalist operation is,
[01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:35.380]  it folds whenever we stand against them, but then they just keep coming back.
[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:38.380]  That's why we need more people to get involved.
[01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:43.380]  We need more people to take action and expose what these globalists and their minions are up to.
[01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:51.380]  Because once we actually face them on the field, they are pathetically disgusting, soul-sucked jellyfish
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:55.380]  that have had their humanity sucked right out of their eyeballs.
[01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:59.380]  And folks are driving by, they're honking. God bless everybody.
[01:53:59.380 --> 01:54:02.380]  We got a lot of people coming by saying they appreciate us.
[01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:09.380]  And it just comes down to the fact that humanity is awakening on hundreds of fronts.
[01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:10.380]  How are you doing, sir?
[01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:15.380]  Very well. I'm Father Christopher Terry. I just wanted to give you this book.
[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:18.380]  John Quincy Adams and the Grand Strategy for the Republic. Thank you very much, sir.
[01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:22.380]  God bless you. What do you think of this event out here? We only planned it for about three days,
[01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:25.380]  but now they're spreading around the country, I think, to reverent children.
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:34.380]  Well, I have a deep admiration for Info Wars, and it's very important that Info Wars, in a sense,
[01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:40.380]  spearheads also the pro-life movement, because certainly the National Conference of Catholic Bishops,
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:46.380]  Pope Francis, they completely turned their back on the pro-life movement.
[01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:57.380]  And Alex, I've always written to Info Wars. I know very, very much about the Vatican and Pope Francis,
[01:54:57.380 --> 01:55:03.380]  their involvement at Cardinal DiNardo down in Houston and D.C. Cardinal Whirl,
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:10.380]  their involvement in Obamacare getting that passed, their involvement now in child sex slave trafficking victims
[01:55:10.380 --> 01:55:16.380]  through the Wilberforce Act, 2008. They've gotten over $30 million between...
[01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:19.380]  Well, I know you've probably written these letters. I've missed them or don't remember them.
[01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:23.380]  I get so much mail about 200 pieces a day, but no, no, no, but send us some information again.
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:28.380]  Attention, Rob, do, and I'll try to look at it. What do you think of these guys trying to censor free speech out here?
[01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:35.380]  It's horrible, but this is a satanic operation, and you ask them, explain yourself, they're like zombies.
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:37.380]  They're like satanic zombies.
[01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:40.380]  You're more well-spoken than I. They are satanic zombies.
[01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:51.380]  Yes, and Planned Parenthood, you know, the memo 200 Kissinger and Nixon, Planned Parenthood becomes the sort of depopulation
[01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:54.380]  of skull and bones, CIA.
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:59.380]  Planned Parenthood with Bill Melinda Gates is involved in forced abortion in China. That's come out in the news.
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:10.380]  I come from Houston, and I go to the I-45 Planned Parenthood. It is the largest late-term abortion clinic,
[01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:18.380]  not just in the Western Hemisphere. In the Western world, the largest one is in Shanghai, South China.
[01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:21.380]  They're both run by Planned Parenthood.
[01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:25.380]  That's right, and they take people there according to the records for forced abortions.
[01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:30.380]  So next, it'll be forced abortion, and you're not for a woman's right if you don't want to make her killer, baby.
[01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:42.380]  Absolutely. This is the end. It's sexual suicide, Christendom, and the Republic are ending in sexual suicide.
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:50.380]  The destruction of the family and, of course, mass annihilation through abortion.
[01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:54.380]  It couldn't be worse. They sacrificed those babies to Satan.
[01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:59.380]  Well, it's come out. A lot of them have admitted that they are Satanists, and it's a sacrament to them.
[01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:02.380]  It's total abomination. Thank you so much, sir. God bless you. Thanks for coming out.
[01:57:02.380 --> 01:57:07.380]  All right, folks. Jakari Jackson has been leading this thing. I kind of came down here and hijacked our operation
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:11.380]  because that'll be a new conspiracy in a hijacked moment demonstration.
[01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:14.380]  Again, I want to thank you all for coming out here. We're going to have another hour.
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:19.380]  David Knight's back at the studio. I know we can't skip this break coming up here in just a moment.
[01:57:19.380 --> 01:57:23.380]  David Knight, take us out to break. We're going to come back and talk to some more of these folks, okay?
[01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:27.380]  All right, we'll do it, Alex. As we've seen before, when we go to cover these rallies,
[01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:31.380]  it was at the state capitol that we were covering a gun control rally.
[01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:39.380]  And there were two protesters there protesting gun control, holding up signs that this was going to be about banning all firearms.
[01:57:39.380 --> 01:57:45.380]  If you remember that clip that we pulled out where the mayor pro tem said, you hang on to that sign.
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:48.380]  We're not doing that just yet, but we're going to make that sign come true.
[01:57:48.380 --> 01:57:55.380]  Well, it was also at that rally that everyone else there tried to cover up the signs of just two protesters who were there,
[01:57:55.380 --> 01:58:00.380]  two counter protesters. They could not allow them to hold their sign up. They wanted to cover it up.
[01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:06.380]  That's precisely what we've seen here at this protest at the Planned Parenthood site in Austin.
[01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:12.380]  Rather than showing up and telling people why they should have an abortion or try to push back against any arguments,
[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:16.380]  they simply want to censor other people's free speech.
[01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:20.380]  When we come back after the break, we're going to talk about an article that's up on info wars.com
[01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:27.380]  about how this is happening across college campuses, free speech zones, permission to exercise your First Amendment,
[01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:31.380]  because they don't respect the right to life, they don't respect the right to keep them bare arms,
[01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:47.380]  and they don't respect your free speech. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[01:59:01.380 --> 01:59:08.380]  100 gallons of water at home every single day. If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:11.380]  Connect residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:16.380]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:21.380]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:25.380]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:28.380]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:35.380]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:38.380]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[01:59:38.380 --> 02:00:00.380]  Go to infowarsstore.com today to purchase your ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system, or call 188-253-3139.
[02:00:09.380 --> 02:00:12.380]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.380 --> 02:00:16.380]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:21.380]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:27.380]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host in the studio.
[02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:32.380]  Alex is headed to the Black Lives Matter protest in front of Planned Parenthood in Austin,
[02:00:32.380 --> 02:00:35.380]  outraged by attempts to shut down freedom of speech.
[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:40.380]  We're going to join Alex right now, live in front of Planned Parenthood. Go ahead, Alex.
[02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:44.380]  Absolutely, and we're here. I'm seeing new crowds come all the time.
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:46.380]  Probably about 60 people here now, a lot of new faces.
[02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:50.380]  People just pop through for 20 minutes, go back to work, like Mr. Jackson.
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:55.380]  Good sir. Not Jakari Jackson, another Jackson. You just popped by real quick. What's your take on this?
[02:00:55.380 --> 02:01:00.380]  I think we should save the babies, have this place shut down, just get rid of all this stuff.
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:02.380]  Absolutely. Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:04.380]  God bless America.
[02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:07.380]  Alright, brother. Absolutely.
[02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:08.380]  Sir?
[02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:13.380]  Yeah, people just don't know this information. It's up to everyone to break out of their comfort zone
[02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:17.380]  and tell the people that they're uncomfortable telling about this information so that we can spread it to everyone.
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:20.380]  Absolutely, force a debate on this.
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:23.380]  Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Obama, they don't want to have a debate on this.
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:26.380]  Yeah, this is really the big deal. Sir, what's your take on this?
[02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:31.380]  Well, I've been studying Margaret Sanger for years. She's the killer.
[02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:35.380]  Yeah, she is. She really is. Most people, it's good work that you're doing educating people.
[02:01:35.380 --> 02:01:40.380]  Most people don't know about it at all. You know, I was at ACC about a couple months ago
[02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:46.380]  and she was there in a black women's conference and it was ridiculous that the amount of ignorance.
[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:47.380]  I mean, some of the representatives.
[02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:50.380]  Right, absolutely. It's a great work.
[02:01:50.380 --> 02:01:56.380]  What do you think of the folks out here saying we're racist and Jakari's racist because we don't want to have half the blacks killed?
[02:01:56.380 --> 02:02:00.380]  Well, I would ignore them. That's what I would do. I would ignore them if I was you.
[02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:06.380]  You call these fake liberals that are actually racist, like Margaret Sanger, who then take the moral high ground and say,
[02:02:06.380 --> 02:02:10.380]  if you don't want to kill 57 million or 56 million babies, you're racist.
[02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:15.380]  It's deception. That's all it is. Deception. You know it better than I do. You've done massive research.
[02:02:15.380 --> 02:02:18.380]  No, that's about me. You guys are the people out here and I salute you all.
[02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:20.380]  Who else wants to get on this mic and say a few words?
[02:02:20.380 --> 02:02:22.380]  Anything else, brother?
[02:02:22.380 --> 02:02:29.380]  No, I just always encourage how it's so easy for you to get out there and speak your mind and all that.
[02:02:29.380 --> 02:02:37.380]  And that really motivates me and gives me a lot of courage to question, you know, whatever we have to question about our government.
[02:02:37.380 --> 02:02:42.380]  I'm a veteran, but it's always good to question everything.
[02:02:42.380 --> 02:02:48.380]  And I'm, you know, it just, I'm motivated by you always questioning everything. It's awesome.
[02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:51.380]  That's what I'm trying to do. God bless you. Ma'am, do you have anything you'd like to add?
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:03:00.380]  I just cannot believe that anybody stands for this to have this many babies killed every day. This has got to stop.
[02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:04.380]  And now it's put the vets on a don't treat list. Now it's killed the old people.
[02:03:04.380 --> 02:03:06.380]  Right. I mean, it's just, it's never going to end.
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:12.380]  No, it's never going to end unless we stop it, unless everybody stands up as one and stops it.
[02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:16.380]  Absolutely. Who else wants to jump in here?
[02:03:16.380 --> 02:03:19.380]  The conception should not be a death sentence. God bless you, Alex.
[02:03:19.380 --> 02:03:21.380]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:03:21.380 --> 02:03:24.380]  So it's a natural progression of people who hate themselves.
[02:03:24.380 --> 02:03:32.380]  Once they realize that we're all the same and everyone, there's a part of us and everyone, then they realize that they're just killing themselves.
[02:03:32.380 --> 02:03:36.380]  Well, that's it. When they're killing anybody, I feel it in my soul and I get mad.
[02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:41.380]  I mean, I'll be honest, I didn't come out here because I have a really aggressive feelings towards these demons.
[02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:43.380]  Yeah. I mean, we're all connected.
[02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:44.380]  Which one of them would have hit me?
[02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:51.380]  As you rise to higher levels of consciousness, you realize that everyone's connected and you can kind of feel what everyone else is feeling.
[02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:57.380]  So, you know, you just have to realize that and if you treat everyone else the way you want it to be treated, you know, you can't go wrong with the golden rule.
[02:03:57.380 --> 02:03:58.380]  I don't know why it's that...
[02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:01.380]  That's what I've done in my life and God's only blessed me and protected me.
[02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:07.380]  Oh, absolutely. And we're all connected in the end with, you know, a higher spirit and a higher power that will eventually bring us all together.
[02:04:07.380 --> 02:04:12.380]  Well, I think the wicked side is getting really scared because there is a human consciousness happening.
[02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:15.380]  Well, the wicked side knows that the good always wins in the end.
[02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:21.380]  It's written in every major book and every story from Lord of the Rings to the Matrix to every motion picture.
[02:04:21.380 --> 02:04:22.380]  It all comes from the same source.
[02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:25.380]  So, they know they're going to lose.
[02:04:25.380 --> 02:04:28.380]  So, you know, they're clawing at the bits to try to make it.
[02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:32.380]  And at the end of the day, when you know you're going to lose, you're going to try everything.
[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:37.380]  Did you see, I'm not trying to be mean, how soulless those guys were. Their eyes were all dead.
[02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:39.380]  Oh, I mean, they can't even talk or have a conversation.
[02:04:39.380 --> 02:04:44.380]  I don't know why you would come out here and try to protest something unless you're just being brainwashed and told what to do by someone else.
[02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:51.380]  It's the inability of someone to think for themselves and decide, this is good, this is bad, this is helpful, this is not.
[02:04:51.380 --> 02:04:56.380]  It's just basically a tomachan from, you know, the stuff in the water.
[02:04:56.380 --> 02:04:58.380]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:01.380]  Osama bin Laden was a 9-11 truther.
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:08.380]  Sy Hearst just released an explosive story debunking the U.S. government's version of events in the 2011 bin Laden raid.
[02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:13.380]  Apparently in response, the White House released a trove of documents they supposedly recovered.
[02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:16.380]  So just what was on bin Laden's bookshelf?
[02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:22.380]  Well, around half of the books recovered were about conspiracies, 9-11, and the Illuminati.
[02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:28.380]  Imagine bin Laden curled up on his couch, fascinated with the myriad of 9-11 conspiracy theories,
[02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:32.380]  knowing that he himself had masterminded the attack.
[02:05:32.380 --> 02:05:41.380]  The other possibility is that the entire list has been completely fabricated in an effort to smear conspiracy theorists as terrorist sympathizers.
[02:05:41.380 --> 02:05:47.380]  Fun fact, you could actually find some of the books on bin Laden's bookshelf right here at the Infowars store.
[02:05:47.380 --> 02:06:05.380]  Terrorists, find out just what was on bin Laden's bookshelf by reading the article Osama Bin Laden was a 9-11 truther at Infowars.com.
[02:06:17.380 --> 02:06:20.380]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.

[02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:58.380]  That's infowarslife.com.
[02:06:58.380 --> 02:07:01.380]  I want more candy, I want more review games, line, line, line.
[02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:11.380]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:14.380]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:17.380]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:07:17.380 --> 02:07:23.380]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:07:23.380 --> 02:07:28.380]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:07:28.380 --> 02:07:35.380]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:43.380]  We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:53.380]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:27.380]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight in studio. Alex has gone to the rally in front of the Planned Parenthood Facility.
[02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:31.380]  Of course, people showed up to shut down freedom of speech. They didn't show up with counter signs.
[02:08:31.380 --> 02:08:36.380]  They showed up with tarps to cover up the signs of the people who are protesting Planned Parenthood.
[02:08:36.380 --> 02:08:41.380]  Alex, I just got a text from my wife. She was there. She said, you did it.
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:44.380]  When you showed up, they dropped their tarps and ran off.
[02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:48.380]  She says she's got one of their tarps as a souvenir.
[02:08:48.380 --> 02:08:52.380]  We're down here pointing out that all Black lives matter. All lives matter.
[02:08:52.380 --> 02:09:03.380]  The very people who want to literally wipe out Black Americans through Planned Parenthood on record are the ones trying to create this whole race war and garbage off some of these tragedies.
[02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:07.380]  We're pointing out the real organized genocide with the documented proof.
[02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:10.380]  We're talking a lot of great folks. Sir, give us your take on all this.
[02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:23.380]  Yeah, I think that we're going to continue forward as a country. Excuse us! Pardon us! Excuse us! Pardon us! Excuse us! Pardon us! Excuse us!
[02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:29.380]  Oh, they're coming back. They managed to reattach. These people are getting shoving and pushing people, grabbing the mic.
[02:09:29.380 --> 02:09:33.380]  We're just assaulted. Get the cops. Get the cops. That guy's, we got the witness.
[02:09:33.380 --> 02:09:37.380]  I guess they don't realize this is being broadcast live. Too stupid to know that.
[02:09:37.380 --> 02:09:41.380]  Now he's hitting.
[02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:47.380]  Alright, clear assault. Get the police over here. Do you have audio? He tried to take the mic.
[02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:51.380]  Do we have audio?
[02:09:51.380 --> 02:09:54.380]  They came in and tried to drag the mic off. He's coming at me again right now.
[02:09:54.380 --> 02:10:03.380]  Yelling, excuse us, excuse us. They came back as a group. This is amazing. These people don't have anything to say. They just want to shut your free speech down.
[02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:08.380]  Bro, you gotta chill, bro. You gotta stay this eye. Take him down. Take him down.
[02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:12.380]  Okay. Yeah, we got, this is insane. Push and shove. They're coming in.
[02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:15.380]  This guy was totally demon-possessed.
[02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:18.380]  You gotta get the police here right now.
[02:10:18.380 --> 02:10:21.380]  Look, another minion attacking.
[02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:27.380]  You people are devil-worshippers and we see it. Your God's falling. You're a fucking bitch.
[02:10:27.380 --> 02:10:34.380]  Your God's falling. Catch that guy. You're weak. You're God's weak.
[02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:39.380]  That was your brother. Thank you, sir. Look at these guys.
[02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:47.380]  It just came in and punched Alex. It just pulled out his mic, so he just lost the mic. Hit and run. That's the tactic that they do.
[02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:55.380]  They try to shut down your free speech. You need to understand that these people who have been telling us that they're pro-choice for so long are the ones who are, he's running off trying to steal a mic.
[02:10:55.380 --> 02:11:01.380]  They're chasing him down. I think he actually got the microphone, pulled it off of the cord. They're following him now.
[02:11:01.380 --> 02:11:09.380]  These are the people telling you that they're pro-choice. They want to shut down all of your choice about not only which insurance company, what level of coverage you're going to have.
[02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:15.380]  They want to shut down your choice about vaccines. They want to force-inject you. It's a medical tyranny.
[02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:22.380]  They don't want to have a discussion about anything. They don't have any signs. They just come up to shut down our signs.
[02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:31.380]  What we're trying to do, and as one of the callers that was one of the people the protest pointed out, when he talks to people about genocide, they don't even understand what he's talking about.
[02:11:31.380 --> 02:11:41.380]  They say they're just profoundly ignorant, and they don't understand or know about the conspiracy quotes from Margaret Singer.
[02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:51.380]  There's not a theory there's conspiracy quotes where she says she wants to do genocide, shut down the black people, shut down the undesirable races.
[02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:55.380]  As she said, we're either going to segregate them or we are going to sterilize them.
[02:11:55.380 --> 02:12:03.380]  She was the founder of Planned Parenthood, and as one of the protesters there said, when he talks to people, they don't know anything about the origins of Planned Parenthood.
[02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:11.380]  They don't know who Margaret Singer is. They've never read any of the things that she said, and they don't even understand what eugenics or genocide are about.
[02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:18.380]  They're profoundly ignorant. That's why it's an information war. Right now, they've got the microphone back, I think, and they're trying to get us hooked up here.
[02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:25.380]  Okay, there we are. Here's Alex. Okay, Alex, you're back. We got you live. Can you hear us?
[02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:30.380]  Okay, what happened was we had a momentary, a guy ran up.
[02:12:30.380 --> 02:12:33.380]  Did you see that, Dana? We have audio yet?
[02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:39.380]  You got audio. Go ahead. Go ahead, Alex. You got audio. You can't hear us.
[02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:44.380]  The guy came up and assaulted Alex and grabbed the microphone and ran off.
[02:12:44.380 --> 02:12:50.380]  They chased him down and got the microphone back, and Alex is still trying to get connected up. You can't hear the weird.
[02:12:50.380 --> 02:12:52.380]  Yes, go ahead. Go ahead.
[02:12:52.380 --> 02:12:53.380]  Can you hear me, David?
[02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:55.380]  Yes, I got you. Go ahead, Alex.
[02:12:55.380 --> 02:13:05.380]  Okay, thank God we always take two bullhorns because we've had MSNBC attack us with knives and cut the cord before at the DNC in Denver.
[02:13:05.380 --> 02:13:11.380]  We just got attacked again. There are arrests anymore over here. Let's get the footage. I'll go tell the police what happened.
[02:13:11.380 --> 02:13:19.380]  All of this is unfolding. We have it all on footage. A literal vampire with see-through white skin.
[02:13:19.380 --> 02:13:25.380]  These are literal demon-possessed people, folks. This is like a movie. They are literally scum of the earth.
[02:13:25.380 --> 02:13:30.380]  And I saw their controller driving around earlier in a black car. It looked like a vampire.
[02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:35.380]  These people are so weak, and they're fluttering around their temple trying to protect it.
[02:13:35.380 --> 02:13:41.380]  It's making no mistake. Rituals go on in that building. We've caught them all over the country, folks. This is what's really going on.
[02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:48.380]  And he assaulted a bunch of people. People controlled themselves. He was going to attack me. Jakari got between us. Great job, Jakari.
[02:13:48.380 --> 02:13:51.380]  He was totally... Rob, dude, describe what you saw.
[02:13:51.380 --> 02:13:57.380]  That guy had a look in his eyes of death and soullessness, and he was like just... You could just see it.
[02:13:57.380 --> 02:14:03.380]  He was going... It was like when those guys in Iraq were killing the puppy and beating up the kids. It was that same mentality.
[02:14:03.380 --> 02:14:08.380]  You saw the enemy. Oh, yeah. You could see it right there. And he was the worst. The other ones didn't have that look.
[02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:12.380]  That guy had the look, and we got it all on tape. We're going to be putting it up. It was all streamed out live, too.
[02:14:12.380 --> 02:14:18.380]  So I'm totally blown away that... This is a pack of vampires. I got them from behind coming in. They all linked.
[02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:22.380]  We know who they are. I want to start hunting them in the Info War. Right.
[02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:26.380]  I want to start going to their haunts. I want to put some legal, lawful teams on them.
[02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:30.380]  They're all right behind us. Yeah. And where are the police?
[02:14:30.380 --> 02:14:34.380]  Yeah, they're over there. They're arresting the Ringwraiths right now.
[02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:40.380]  We need to send somebody over to talk to the police so that they can get the truth of what happened so they don't let them go.
[02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:45.380]  We have it all on footage. We have everything on tape. We need the awesome police to come over here.
[02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:50.380]  They've already been helpful so far. Let's send over Jakari Jakari.
[02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:52.380]  I think he's on, too.
[02:14:52.380 --> 02:14:56.380]  Okay. Well, I want to get the police over here as soon as they get people. Pardon me, sir?
[02:14:56.380 --> 02:14:57.380]  Sure.
[02:14:57.380 --> 02:15:02.380]  No, sir. God bless you. I want to tell the police exactly what happened.
[02:15:02.380 --> 02:15:09.380]  That guy shoved, hit, punch, kicked, and he did it all like that animated demon thing where they have no soul.
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:15.380]  Like in movies. I mean, these people are literal scum, literal filth.
[02:15:15.380 --> 02:15:24.380]  Absolute, absolute bottom of the barrel trash here like mobs at a flame at the stench of the dead babies in there.
[02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:32.380]  Just getting off on it at every level. And their evil, their evil has exposed them yet again.
[02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:37.380]  I mean, look at this guy. It's like the hillside. I mean, it's just unbelievable the emptiness.
[02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:43.380]  You guys really love abortion, don't you? Absolutely.
[02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:49.380]  Hey, well, don't worry. Don't worry that, you know, you guys love garbing yourself in black like you're tough.
[02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:53.380]  You love death so much, believe me. God's got a way of giving you what you want.
[02:15:53.380 --> 02:16:01.380]  So enjoy it. I think you guys are a fascinating topic. We're going to start covering you guys. I hope you enjoy it.
[02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:03.380]  Yeah, they have so many people with them.
[02:16:03.380 --> 02:16:09.380]  Absolutely. Total minions of evil. Yeah, we already know who you are. Not releasing your names isn't going to help.
[02:16:09.380 --> 02:16:17.380]  And the rap sheets on these guys are going to be very, very serious. I need to talk to the police.
[02:16:17.380 --> 02:16:23.380]  I need to speak to the officers. I want to send Weldon. Yeah, we need to speak to the police. All right, I'm going over here.
[02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:29.380]  Bring me the cameras. Listen, it's all right, buddy. I'm going to talk to this guy. I'll do what I want. Thank you.
[02:16:29.380 --> 02:16:35.380]  Hey, how you doing? Good well. When are the officers going to come over, police sir? Shortly. Fantastic.
[02:16:35.380 --> 02:16:39.380]  Just, just, you promised you'll ask him to come over to us.
[02:16:39.380 --> 02:16:42.380]  Okay, thank you. We need to arrest them. We have video of them assaulting people.
[02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:48.380]  Not like the assault going on inside there, but it's, I mean, they're not cutting up babies or anything.
[02:16:48.380 --> 02:16:54.380]  They're just here like Renfield protecting Dracula's castle, but it doesn't work, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:58.380]  Absolutely. That guy was like a reanimated corpse.
[02:16:58.380 --> 02:17:03.380]  I'm telling you, these people are the scum of the earth. God.
[02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:08.380]  I wouldn't be surprised if God just blew the whole planet up to cleanse it of this disease and blew us up along with it.
[02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:14.380]  I mean, this is just, what did you, sir? I saw one of the minions was attacking you. What was, did you see the look in their eyes?
[02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:19.380]  Crazed look just out in space. I mean, the guy had, I mean, it's beyond the stuff I've seen from the Manson family.
[02:17:19.380 --> 02:17:24.380]  It's in the way they look. They're nothing. They are nothing.
[02:17:24.380 --> 02:17:30.380]  I can see your soul. I love you. Love you too. God bless you. We're going to beat these people. I hate the new old order.
[02:17:30.380 --> 02:17:34.380]  He's the name. Yeah. Damn right. You people are going to get it. People ask me why I'm a Christian.
[02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:38.380]  Why do I talk about God? I don't mean these fake churches. I face the new old order over and over again.
[02:17:38.380 --> 02:17:44.380]  They're all devil worshipers. It's real. We know who they are and we're sick of them. You've been ousted.
[02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:50.380]  We're sick of you hurting children, you filth. We see you. We see you and humanity's rising.
[02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:56.380]  You sit there and him pick us and tell us to submit. We'll never submit to you and humanity's rising.
[02:17:56.380 --> 02:18:02.380]  And God sees everything. Damn right. God sees everything. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:10.380]  Well, we've exposed the filth. See, we drew the enemy out. And I want to salute all of you that are here. God bless you.
[02:18:10.380 --> 02:18:19.380]  Well, then, Henson, come on over here and talk to us. I saw him assaulting you, sir. What was that like?
[02:18:19.380 --> 02:18:24.380]  Just crazy. They looked up arms. They just kind of charging through. And that guy just crazy in his eyes.
[02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:27.380]  I saw him shooting and hitting on you. You were a strain. You just held him back.
[02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:29.380]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't want to try to get him.
[02:18:29.380 --> 02:18:33.380]  I thought you could have given him a good pop, though. Well, I didn't want it to get violent. That's what they want.
[02:18:33.380 --> 02:18:38.380]  Yeah. They're trying to inside it. Yeah, they were waiting to want me to hit them. Yeah. They were trying to inside it.
[02:18:38.380 --> 02:18:44.380]  Yeah, don't fall on the trap. Don't fall on the trap. Play their games. Yeah, he did. He did. Absolutely.
[02:18:44.380 --> 02:18:49.380]  Well, now the paper that wants to ignore this, like they even matter anymore, will have to cover it because of the arrest. Good.
[02:18:49.380 --> 02:18:54.380]  And it wasn't us that got arrested. See, the enemy didn't get what they wanted.
[02:18:54.380 --> 02:19:05.380]  Man, I'm telling you earlier, some of these guys drove by literal demon, even worse than those.
[02:19:05.380 --> 02:19:09.380]  Yeah. I mean, the guy was just a huge coward because he comes up, he's shoving around.
[02:19:09.380 --> 02:19:15.380]  He's about to get in the fight with this guy. And I was trying to break it up because it looks like he's about to snap him in half.
[02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:19.380]  And he's like, who are you going to do? And then he comes up to me and I'm like, okay, I'm like, what do you want to do?
[02:19:19.380 --> 02:19:26.380]  And he's like, and he grabs a mic and runs off like a little girl. You know, so that's how these guys are.
[02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:30.380]  They want to stop the First Amendment. We're going to break. Let's get shots of them getting arrested over here.
[02:19:30.380 --> 02:19:36.380]  Police are doing their job. That's why we're going to take back our communities and have good police departments.
[02:19:36.380 --> 02:19:40.380]  I tell you, that's why they want us all fighting with each other so they can have war on the streets and come after us.
[02:19:40.380 --> 02:19:44.380]  That's why they want to get a war with the police going. We got to reform the police, not fall in sorrel's trap.

[02:22:57.380 --> 02:23:00.380]  Friends, this is Alex Jones for MidasResources.com.

[02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:14.380]  I own my gold as a hedge against inflation.
[02:23:14.380 --> 02:23:20.380]  This Federal Reserve fiat currency could go the way of the Deutsche Mark and the Weimar Republic anytime.
[02:23:20.380 --> 02:23:25.380]  In these historically dangerous times, it makes sense to physically hold gold and silver.
[02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:28.380]  Midas already has some of the best deals in the industry.
[02:23:28.380 --> 02:23:34.380]  But if you give them a call and mention the radio special, they will give you a list of the day's super specials.

[02:23:51.380 --> 02:24:13.380]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:24:13.380 --> 02:24:15.380]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight.
[02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:19.380]  In studio, we have Alex live at the protest in front of Planned Parenthood,
[02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:22.380]  which we're trying to point out that black lives matter,
[02:24:22.380 --> 02:24:27.380]  and they have been the target of Planned Parenthood from its inception by their founder, Margaret Sanger.
[02:24:27.380 --> 02:24:33.380]  Counter protesters showed up to try to just hold up black signs, black tarp over the signs that were there.
[02:24:33.380 --> 02:24:37.380]  Alex was outraged at their attempts to shut down free speech.
[02:24:37.380 --> 02:24:43.380]  He went to the rally and they just cut the mic cable, shared it, something, and ran off with a microphone.
[02:24:43.380 --> 02:24:46.380]  Giving us an update now is Alex Jones. Go ahead, Alex.
[02:24:46.380 --> 02:24:49.380]  That's right, and Rob Dew and Weldon Hinsher in a breakdown would happen.
[02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:51.380]  Weldon got assaulted by them and had to push them off of them.
[02:24:51.380 --> 02:24:55.380]  What they did was knock over men and women, locking arms and stomp on you.
[02:24:55.380 --> 02:24:58.380]  Weldon didn't let them do that, so he pushed the zombies back over.
[02:24:58.380 --> 02:25:00.380]  The police were seeing if they were going to arrest them.
[02:25:00.380 --> 02:25:05.380]  We have them assaulting like 10 people on video, but they're over there trying to claim that we basically assaulted them.
[02:25:05.380 --> 02:25:07.380]  But Rob Dew, what did you see and what did you catch on this camera?
[02:25:07.380 --> 02:25:10.380]  Yeah, I've got it on this camera. We're going to put it up here later today.
[02:25:10.380 --> 02:25:12.380]  They started back over by the entrance.
[02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:14.380]  They all locked arms and they all started walking towards the group,
[02:25:14.380 --> 02:25:18.380]  and they started running into people going, excuse me, excuse me, pushing people out of the way.
[02:25:18.380 --> 02:25:20.380]  They hit an old man first.
[02:25:20.380 --> 02:25:22.380]  So he moved out of the way and they kept coming.
[02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:25.380]  Then they ran into Weldon. Weldon's not a pushover.
[02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:27.380]  So he said, no, don't push me.
[02:25:27.380 --> 02:25:31.380]  Let's be clear. I told them three times after they had me trapped,
[02:25:31.380 --> 02:25:34.380]  I said, you're physically assaulting us. You need to stop it right now and you need to stop.
[02:25:34.380 --> 02:25:37.380]  Please stop. I told them three times. They backed me up, surrounded me.
[02:25:37.380 --> 02:25:38.380]  I had to push them back.
[02:25:38.380 --> 02:25:41.380]  Well, that zombie clawed me right here, and it's not that big a deal.
[02:25:41.380 --> 02:25:46.380]  Let's be honest too, when they had me surrounded,
[02:25:46.380 --> 02:25:49.380]  they were kicking me and someone clawed me too.
[02:25:49.380 --> 02:25:51.380]  There was another one over there who started calling me and I was just like,
[02:25:51.380 --> 02:25:53.380]  you guys need to get off, so I had to push them back.
[02:25:53.380 --> 02:25:55.380]  But aren't these Satan minions weak?
[02:25:55.380 --> 02:25:57.380]  I mean, they're little claws and stuff. It's like a...
[02:25:57.380 --> 02:26:00.380]  They're weak. There's no doubt about it. They don't have human spirit.
[02:26:00.380 --> 02:26:02.380]  That's why they want to target children.
[02:26:02.380 --> 02:26:04.380]  Exactly. It's easy target, right?
[02:26:04.380 --> 02:26:07.380]  Well, I've just been waiting forever to be able to talk to the cops.
[02:26:07.380 --> 02:26:09.380]  Well, this guy over here, this is the guy to attack them.
[02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:12.380]  Sir, come over here and tell us about the ringwraith that you tackled.
[02:26:12.380 --> 02:26:13.380]  Sure.
[02:26:13.380 --> 02:26:17.380]  So he grabbed the mic twice, was hitting people, he chased them over there, what happened?
[02:26:17.380 --> 02:26:21.380]  Two guys tried to take him down, but they couldn't, so I took him down.
[02:26:21.380 --> 02:26:24.380]  And then I grabbed him by the call and I held him there.
[02:26:24.380 --> 02:26:27.380]  And I was looking around for a police or like anyone to videotape it,
[02:26:27.380 --> 02:26:30.380]  but all of his friends ran up and they said,
[02:26:30.380 --> 02:26:33.380]  we have it on video and they were just videotaping me, so I just figured...
[02:26:33.380 --> 02:26:36.380]  Look at those green cars smiling right there. They think it's funny.
[02:26:36.380 --> 02:26:38.380]  They're going to think it's funny if the cops don't arrest them.
[02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:40.380]  I'm going to have to do all the other channels.
[02:26:40.380 --> 02:26:41.380]  Go ahead.
[02:26:41.380 --> 02:26:44.380]  Anyways, I'll let him go and he ran off.
[02:26:44.380 --> 02:26:47.380]  I just, I didn't know that I could make the citizens rest at that time.
[02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:51.380]  If I would have known that, I would have held him and I would have dragged him over here.
[02:26:51.380 --> 02:26:54.380]  Well, good job, brother. And hey, we had a backup mic,
[02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:57.380]  but trying to take down banners, trying to block our banners,
[02:26:57.380 --> 02:27:00.380]  kicking people, attacking people, assaulting the equipment,
[02:27:00.380 --> 02:27:02.380]  stealing the microphone, breaking the cord.
[02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:06.380]  I mean, this is a group of scum.
[02:27:09.380 --> 02:27:12.380]  Here, get some photos of them smiling and laughing over there.
[02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:14.380]  We need that on tape.
[02:27:14.380 --> 02:27:16.380]  Alex, we have something. I think the...
[02:27:16.380 --> 02:27:18.380]  Zoom, I want to get the laughing in the...
[02:27:18.380 --> 02:27:20.380]  We already got your face, scum.
[02:27:20.380 --> 02:27:22.380]  God, I hate scum.
[02:27:22.380 --> 02:27:28.380]  Alex, I think we have the Facebook page of this group that they're ready to throw up on the screen.
[02:27:28.380 --> 02:27:30.380]  Yeah, go ahead. Let's do that.
[02:27:30.380 --> 02:27:32.380]  I don't want to give it too much attention, guys.
[02:27:32.380 --> 02:27:34.380]  I want to think about what we're going to do first, okay?
[02:27:34.380 --> 02:27:36.380]  Yeah, Red Guard, Austin.
[02:27:36.380 --> 02:27:39.380]  Yeah, that's the... Looks like that's the group.
[02:27:39.380 --> 02:27:41.380]  Yeah, I don't even want to...
[02:27:41.380 --> 02:27:44.380]  We're examining what group it is. We'll find out for sure.
[02:27:44.380 --> 02:27:47.380]  And we'll see if it's affiliated with that group before we take action.
[02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:53.380]  But this is the enemy. This is the black clothes ring rights.
[02:27:53.380 --> 02:27:55.380]  That's why I tell the cops, why do you want to wear black uniforms?
[02:27:55.380 --> 02:27:57.380]  Because the globalists try to standardize your uniform.
[02:27:57.380 --> 02:27:59.380]  Alex, you don't want to look like him.
[02:27:59.380 --> 02:28:02.380]  There's a guy with a beard that refused to talk, the long beard.
[02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:04.380]  They've got a picture of him on Facebook.
[02:28:04.380 --> 02:28:07.380]  He's holding up Red Guard's banner.
[02:28:07.380 --> 02:28:10.380]  So this is Red Guard's Austin, and he's marching with them holding the banner.
[02:28:10.380 --> 02:28:12.380]  So it looks like that means...
[02:28:12.380 --> 02:28:14.380]  Yeah, your audio to me is real distorted. He's holding up a what?
[02:28:14.380 --> 02:28:16.380]  He's holding up a banner that says Red Guard.
[02:28:16.380 --> 02:28:19.380]  It's a hammer and sickle. It's Red Guard's Austin.
[02:28:19.380 --> 02:28:21.380]  That appears to be the group there was.
[02:28:21.380 --> 02:28:23.380]  Let's go over here then.
[02:28:23.380 --> 02:28:25.380]  You're saying this guy?
[02:28:25.380 --> 02:28:27.380]  Yeah, that guy right there.
[02:28:27.380 --> 02:28:29.380]  They got him on Facebook, the Facebook page.
[02:28:29.380 --> 02:28:30.380]  I did.
[02:28:30.380 --> 02:28:31.380]  Red Guard's Austin.
[02:28:31.380 --> 02:28:32.380]  Well, good.
[02:28:32.380 --> 02:28:33.380]  You put your hands on me.
[02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:34.380]  There he is.
[02:28:34.380 --> 02:28:35.380]  More lies.
[02:28:35.380 --> 02:28:38.380]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
[02:28:38.380 --> 02:28:40.380]  That's pretty cool, man.
[02:28:40.380 --> 02:28:43.380]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:47.380]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[02:28:47.380 --> 02:28:48.380]  I don't think so.
[02:28:48.380 --> 02:28:50.380]  Oh, yeah.
[02:28:50.380 --> 02:28:56.380]  And he's standing right next to a Black Lives Matter sign in the march.
[02:28:56.380 --> 02:29:01.380]  So there's the Communist Party holding red flags and a Black Lives Matter sign,
[02:29:01.380 --> 02:29:03.380]  and there's our guy there with the beard.
[02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:06.380]  Wait a minute, you marching a Black Lives Matter thing with a hammer and sickle?
[02:29:06.380 --> 02:29:08.380]  Is that you?
[02:29:08.380 --> 02:29:09.380]  What are you talking about?
[02:29:09.380 --> 02:29:10.380]  We're just asking.
[02:29:10.380 --> 02:29:11.380]  Are you?
[02:29:11.380 --> 02:29:12.380]  Are you talking to the audience?
[02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:15.380]  No, we're just asking if that's your Facebook, because we got it on TV right now.
[02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:16.380]  I didn't press the aliens.
[02:29:16.380 --> 02:29:17.380]  That's mean to you.
[02:29:17.380 --> 02:29:19.380]  That's really impressive.
[02:29:19.380 --> 02:29:21.380]  You're something else.
[02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:24.380]  I've never met an alien before. What's it like? Which planet?
[02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:25.380]  What do they sound like?
[02:29:25.380 --> 02:29:26.380]  It's a planet as soon as possible.
[02:29:26.380 --> 02:29:27.380]  Yeah, it is.
[02:29:27.380 --> 02:29:28.380]  It's surprising.
[02:29:30.380 --> 02:29:31.380]  I think they've got hurt as well.
[02:29:31.380 --> 02:29:34.380]  Anyways, do you have any language skills other than cuss words?
[02:29:34.380 --> 02:29:36.380]  Cuss words.
[02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:38.380]  No, that's shut her up.
[02:29:38.380 --> 02:29:39.380]  We're evil than ghosts.
[02:29:39.380 --> 02:29:40.380]  Alright, we've got to go to a break.
[02:29:40.380 --> 02:29:45.380]  We're going to be right back, live at Planned Parenthood with people who don't like free speech either.
[02:29:45.380 --> 02:29:56.380]  Stay with us and be right back.
[02:30:15.380 --> 02:30:25.380]  We're going to be right back.
[02:30:45.380 --> 02:30:55.380]  This is Leanne McAdoo reporting for infowars.com.

[02:31:33.380 --> 02:31:38.380]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[02:31:38.380 --> 02:31:43.380]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while,
[02:31:43.380 --> 02:31:48.380]  then burn you out in my experience where stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.

[02:33:20.380 --> 02:33:25.380]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:25.380 --> 02:33:28.380]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.380 --> 02:33:30.380]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:30.380 --> 02:33:32.380]  I'm David Knight in studio.
[02:33:32.380 --> 02:33:40.380]  We have Alex has gone to the Black Lives Matter rally pointing out that it's not just Black Lives Matter when they're adults.
[02:33:40.380 --> 02:33:43.380]  It's Black Lives Matter when it comes to abortion as well.
[02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:47.380]  People are profoundly ignorant of the roots of Planned Parenthood.
[02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:56.380]  But of course this rally was interrupted. The reason Alex went there was because they were interrupted by what apparently is a communist group here in Austin, the Red Guard Austin.
[02:33:56.380 --> 02:34:03.380]  We have multiple pictures up on their Facebook account of definitely one individual there with a very long beard.
[02:34:03.380 --> 02:34:14.380]  There's pictures of him at a Black Lives rally march standing behind the Red Guard Austin as well as holding up a sign that says donate to end capitalism.
[02:34:14.380 --> 02:34:18.380]  Communists hate life but they love censorship.
[02:34:18.380 --> 02:34:22.380]  They hold their sign. They're tarps up to cover up other people's signs.
[02:34:22.380 --> 02:34:24.380]  Let's go to Alex right now and find out what's going on.
[02:34:24.380 --> 02:34:26.380]  I've got to show him the broken microphone.
[02:34:26.380 --> 02:34:31.380]  So let's let Knight take over for about 10 minutes and then after I'm done talking to the police.
[02:34:31.380 --> 02:34:34.380]  But right now, where's the broken microphone unless I have to give it to him?
[02:34:34.380 --> 02:34:35.380]  I don't have the microphone. I have the cable.
[02:34:35.380 --> 02:34:36.380]  Who has it? Do?
[02:34:36.380 --> 02:34:37.380]  I think you do.
[02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:39.380]  Jackari, get Jackari over here. He's a witness.
[02:34:39.380 --> 02:34:40.380]  This is the risk side of it.
[02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:48.380]  Here, let's get Jackari. Here, David Knight, you take over covering live Planned Parenthood, all Black Lives Matter protests, assaulted by the Red Guard.
[02:34:48.380 --> 02:34:49.380]  That is their group. I can't believe it.
[02:34:49.380 --> 02:34:54.380]  Who appear to be a want to be vampire zombie club.
[02:34:54.380 --> 02:34:57.380]  I mean, that's my opinion. That's how I would describe them as bizarre.
[02:34:57.380 --> 02:34:59.380]  We'll continue to engage in an analysis of it.
[02:34:59.380 --> 02:35:01.380]  The women are now claiming that we assaulted them.
[02:35:01.380 --> 02:35:02.380]  So that's standard stuff.
[02:35:02.380 --> 02:35:04.380]  Standard feminist demon line.
[02:35:04.380 --> 02:35:06.380]  So Weldon Henson, we're going to throw back now.
[02:35:06.380 --> 02:35:08.380]  Anything else you'd like to add? Go ahead.
[02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:10.380]  No, they're not going to, they did not succeed.
[02:35:10.380 --> 02:35:13.380]  They made it better for us.
[02:35:13.380 --> 02:35:14.380]  Absolutely.
[02:35:14.380 --> 02:35:21.380]  It's amazing that they were so obtuse that they didn't realize that this was being recorded with multiple cameras.
[02:35:21.380 --> 02:35:28.380]  They had been there for quite some time, trying to cover up people who were protesting the abortions at Planned Parenthood.
[02:35:28.380 --> 02:35:33.380]  They came out not with signs supporting their side, simply to shut down free speech.
[02:35:33.380 --> 02:35:39.380]  They showed up with black tarps, tried to cover up the signs. When Alex came, they left, they regrouped.
[02:35:39.380 --> 02:35:43.380]  They pushed their way through the crowd, screaming, excuse me, excuse me.
[02:35:43.380 --> 02:35:46.380]  But it was actually an assault. They went in, they cut the microphone cable.
[02:35:46.380 --> 02:35:48.380]  They stole the microphone.
[02:35:48.380 --> 02:35:50.380]  I think they've damaged one of those microphones.
[02:35:50.380 --> 02:35:56.380]  So we've got audio issues with the people who are there trying to get the live report.
[02:35:56.380 --> 02:36:00.380]  Nevertheless, this is something that we see time and again.
[02:36:00.380 --> 02:36:05.380]  We saw the same thing happen at the state capitol when Jakari and I and my wife were covering that.
[02:36:05.380 --> 02:36:09.380]  We had a gun control rally that was being held.
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:16.380]  There were two counter protesters in support of gun rights that showed up and said, this is outright gun ban.
[02:36:16.380 --> 02:36:23.380]  And the city councilman at Austin said, who was speaking at the time, said, we're not doing that right now,
[02:36:23.380 --> 02:36:27.380]  but you hang on to those signs, those signs saying that they're going to ban guns.
[02:36:27.380 --> 02:36:30.380]  You hang on to those signs because we're going to make that happen.
[02:36:30.380 --> 02:36:33.380]  Now, what happened at the same time that was going on?
[02:36:33.380 --> 02:36:37.380]  The people who were there did everything they could to cover up those two signs of protesters.
[02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:41.380]  Nevertheless, they showed up, they had something to say about the Second Amendment.
[02:36:41.380 --> 02:36:45.380]  These people, all they want to do is shut down free speech.
[02:36:45.380 --> 02:36:52.380]  The only thing they will say is that Alex Jones is anti-woman, an ad hominem attack, unsupported by anything.
[02:36:52.380 --> 02:36:55.380]  They'll yell, sexist, racist.
[02:36:55.380 --> 02:36:58.380]  That's it. That's their argument.
[02:36:58.380 --> 02:37:01.380]  That's what you see over and over again.
[02:37:01.380 --> 02:37:05.380]  We've got an article that's up on infowars.com today by Kit Daniels.
[02:37:05.380 --> 02:37:10.380]  Campus police intimidate student over her anti-Obama and pro-gun signs.
[02:37:10.380 --> 02:37:14.380]  Student was told she needed special permission for protest signs.
[02:37:14.380 --> 02:37:17.380]  This was at Blinn College in Brenham, Texas.
[02:37:17.380 --> 02:37:20.380]  The student, Nicole Sanders, talked to Kit Daniels.
[02:37:20.380 --> 02:37:24.380]  She said she was told she needed permission for these signs.
[02:37:24.380 --> 02:37:27.380]  She had to stay in a college free speech zone.
[02:37:27.380 --> 02:37:29.380]  Where have we seen that before?
[02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:33.380]  Oh, yeah. That was the BLM did that out at the Bundy Ranch.
[02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:36.380]  Out in the middle of nowhere, they put a free speech area.
[02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:42.380]  They had a professionally printed sign that they put on their fence that they created out in the middle of nowhere.
[02:37:42.380 --> 02:37:49.380]  A handwritten sign was put up by the protesters that said the free speech is not an area.
[02:37:49.380 --> 02:37:51.380]  But we've seen it before that.
[02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:56.380]  All of the Republican and Democrat presidential conventions,
[02:37:56.380 --> 02:38:02.380]  they always remove the protesters to a remote location and put them in a cage.
[02:38:02.380 --> 02:38:06.380]  That's been standard operating procedure for the last several presidential elections.
[02:38:06.380 --> 02:38:10.380]  This is how they deal with free speech. They deal with it with censorship.
[02:38:10.380 --> 02:38:15.380]  We see that with the Internet. That's what we're concerned about as well with the government taking control of the Internet.
[02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:17.380]  That's the way these authoritarians work.
[02:38:17.380 --> 02:38:20.380]  Let's understand that they're not about pro-choice whatsoever.
[02:38:20.380 --> 02:38:25.380]  The same people who are pushing the quote-unquote pro-choice position in state after state
[02:38:25.380 --> 02:38:28.380]  are also trying to mandate vaccines.
[02:38:28.380 --> 02:38:31.380]  Take away your informed consent.
[02:38:31.380 --> 02:38:34.380]  It is a hallmark of medical tyranny.
[02:38:34.380 --> 02:38:36.380]  Going back to the story that Kit Daniels has.
[02:38:36.380 --> 02:38:42.380]  She said, I felt the police were there to intimidate us to stop without any problems and it worked.
[02:38:42.380 --> 02:38:45.380]  The police made me nervous. This is what's happening on college campuses.
[02:38:45.380 --> 02:38:47.380]  They're simply shutting down the free speech.
[02:38:47.380 --> 02:38:51.380]  Just as we saw with this group, the Red Guard Austin, this communist group.
[02:38:51.380 --> 02:38:56.380]  She said, in response, she got help from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.
[02:38:56.380 --> 02:38:58.380]  That's F-I-R-E, FIRE.
[02:38:58.380 --> 02:39:03.380]  They have filed a lawsuit against the college stating that its policies and their enforcement are unconstitutional.
[02:39:03.380 --> 02:39:11.380]  And as we point out, this story is eerily similar to an incident at California Polytechnic State University Pomona earlier this year
[02:39:11.380 --> 02:39:21.380]  in which school officials were also requiring students who engaged in First Amendment activities on campus to apply for a free speech permit.
[02:39:21.380 --> 02:39:28.380]  Listen, it is a right. It is not a privilege. You don't get permits for rights.
[02:39:28.380 --> 02:39:32.380]  You only get permits if it's a government-granted privilege.
[02:39:32.380 --> 02:39:36.380]  The free speech is a right that we get from God.
[02:39:36.380 --> 02:39:45.380]  The Constitution is a contract that government created saying that they would not trample on the rights that we already had.
[02:39:45.380 --> 02:39:54.380]  And when they talk about, and these are state schools, when they talk about taking away your permission to exercise your free speech,
[02:39:54.380 --> 02:39:57.380]  that is precisely what's going on.
[02:39:57.380 --> 02:40:02.380]  We're going to be going back to the coverage. You can see that in the background there again at the rally.
[02:40:02.380 --> 02:40:07.380]  We'll sort out what happened. The microphone was cut and attempted to be stolen.
[02:40:07.380 --> 02:40:10.380]  I think they destroyed one of the microphones that are there.
[02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:14.380]  They assaulted Alex and Weldon and several other people there.
[02:40:14.380 --> 02:40:17.380]  That's the way they deal with it. They don't have anything to say.
[02:40:17.380 --> 02:40:22.380]  They simply want to shut you down with force, shut you down with censorship.
[02:40:22.380 --> 02:40:26.380]  That's what the Red Guard, the communists, and Austin want to do.
[02:40:26.380 --> 02:40:37.380]  We've got pictures of them amazingly marching behind a sign with a hammer and sickle with red flags with the Black Lives Matter sign.
[02:40:37.380 --> 02:40:42.380]  And as we've pointed out, this Black Lives Matter is an astroturf organization.
[02:40:42.380 --> 02:40:46.380]  It's a movement started and funded by many Soros organizations.
[02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:55.380]  We just had a story yesterday about how protesters were caught on tape angry that they were not being paid for protesting in Ferguson and other places.
[02:40:55.380 --> 02:41:04.380]  They had an agreement with these Soros organizations that they were going to be paid if they would show up and protest or cause riots.
[02:41:04.380 --> 02:41:06.380]  This is something that is happening throughout the world.
[02:41:06.380 --> 02:41:12.380]  We've got a story today on Infowars. George Soros saying he's concerned that we're getting close to World War III.
[02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:15.380]  Is he concerned or is that really what he's trying to do?
[02:41:15.380 --> 02:41:24.380]  We know that he's been behind and his NGO organizations that he's been funding have been behind these color movements that have been happening throughout Eastern Europe.
[02:41:24.380 --> 02:41:31.380]  They are intricately involved with what's going on in the Ukraine, pushing that into a confrontation, reviving the Cold War.
[02:41:31.380 --> 02:41:36.380]  And then he comes out as if he's really concerned that we're going to have World War III.
[02:41:36.380 --> 02:41:39.380]  Of course we're going to have World War III if he is successful.
[02:41:39.380 --> 02:41:43.380]  That is what he's working for.
[02:41:43.380 --> 02:41:45.380]  At the same time, all this is going on.
[02:41:45.380 --> 02:41:50.380]  We had one fellow who was at the rally saying, we need to look at globalism.
[02:41:50.380 --> 02:41:52.380]  Globalism is killing more people than abortion.
[02:41:52.380 --> 02:41:58.380]  Listen, you need to understand what's going on globally, but you always need to act locally.
[02:41:58.380 --> 02:42:09.380]  Understand what the big picture is, but understand also that it is at the local level, like these abortion protests, like local government, where you can make the greatest effect.
[02:42:09.380 --> 02:42:11.380]  But what is happening globally?
[02:42:11.380 --> 02:42:15.380]  Let's understand where we're going with this TPP and fast track.
[02:42:15.380 --> 02:42:26.380]  It has just now cleared another hurdle today. The vote was 62 rather than the 65 that they had to a cloture vote that they had a week ago on last Thursday.
[02:42:26.380 --> 02:42:42.380]  It began this process of giving the trade promotion authority, giving authority to Obama's U.S. trade representative who has been negotiating this treaty for years in secret with corporate lobbyists.
[02:42:42.380 --> 02:42:46.380]  Now they have the treaty ready. Now they're trying to give formal authority to them.
[02:42:46.380 --> 02:42:51.380]  So it began with a filibuster last week. The filibuster was shut down with a cloture vote last Thursday.
[02:42:51.380 --> 02:42:57.380]  Mitch McConnell said they're going to push the fast track authority, the trade promotion authority.
[02:42:57.380 --> 02:42:59.380]  They're going to push that through this week.
[02:42:59.380 --> 02:43:02.380]  Once they do, understand that the TPP is finished.
[02:43:02.380 --> 02:43:07.380]  They're going to lay it on the table and they're going to say to our congressmen, sign it.
[02:43:07.380 --> 02:43:11.380]  No amendments. You just sign it.
[02:43:11.380 --> 02:43:18.380]  As I pointed out on the nightly news, this is the formal recognition of the fact that power has transferred.
[02:43:18.380 --> 02:43:25.380]  It's very similar to what happened at Runnymede with a Magna Carter, the big charter.
[02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:32.380]  This was a big charter where the nobles came to King John and they said, you're going to sign this and it was something that they had written.
[02:43:32.380 --> 02:43:37.380]  He hadn't written it. He didn't like what it was because it devolved power away from him to them.
[02:43:37.380 --> 02:43:44.380]  They elevated themselves to be peers of the realm. In other words, we are as important as you are, King John.
[02:43:44.380 --> 02:43:49.380]  No amendments for King John. He didn't write any of it. They just put it down and they said, sign it.
[02:43:49.380 --> 02:43:54.380]  That is what's going on with the Trans-Pacific Partnership now.
[02:43:54.380 --> 02:43:58.380]  Our congressmen, our representatives, the people, we are not allowed to see that.
[02:43:58.380 --> 02:44:04.380]  We the people who created the government, we the people who set up a constitutional republic, we have no stake in this.
[02:44:04.380 --> 02:44:10.380]  We are not stakeholders. They are now formalizing what is an accomplished fact.
[02:44:10.380 --> 02:44:16.380]  The fact that power has transferred out of Washington to these multinational corporations who have written it.
[02:44:16.380 --> 02:44:24.380]  Now today, as Congress moved one step closer to passing this, we see the Electronic Frontier Foundation talking about how
[02:44:24.380 --> 02:44:33.380]  hundreds of tech companies have written a letter, an open letter to Congress saying that TPP and FastTrack harms digital innovation and users' rights.
[02:44:33.380 --> 02:44:39.380]  This is more than 250 technology companies and user rights organizations in a joint letter.
[02:44:39.380 --> 02:44:47.380]  They say that the TPP threatens digital innovation, threatens free speech, threatens access to knowledge online.
[02:44:47.380 --> 02:44:55.380]  They say that giving this trade promotion authority to the U.S. Trade Representative legitimizes this secretive process.
[02:44:55.380 --> 02:44:58.380]  That's precisely it. That's why this bill is so important.
[02:44:58.380 --> 02:45:04.380]  You need to get a hold of your reps and you need to say, we see what you're doing.
[02:45:04.380 --> 02:45:10.380]  If you vote for this FastTrack authority, you are legitimizing a secretive process.
[02:45:10.380 --> 02:45:16.380]  Listen to this quote from an author, and I had this right here.
[02:45:16.380 --> 02:45:20.380]  This is an author, science fiction author, Corey Doctorow.
[02:45:20.380 --> 02:45:23.380]  This is what he said about this whole process.
[02:45:23.380 --> 02:45:29.380]  He said, democracies make their laws in public, not in smoke-filled rooms.
[02:45:29.380 --> 02:45:36.380]  If the TPP's backers truly believed that they were doing the people's work, they would have invited the people into the room.
[02:45:36.380 --> 02:45:43.380]  The fact that they went to extreme, unprecedented measures to stop anyone from finding out what was going on,
[02:45:43.380 --> 02:45:49.380]  even going so far as to threaten Congress with jail if they spoke about it,
[02:45:49.380 --> 02:45:55.380]  tells you that this is something that is being done to Americans, not for Americans.
[02:45:55.380 --> 02:45:57.380]  Do you understand that?
[02:45:57.380 --> 02:46:03.380]  When Rand Paul complained about the secretive process at the end of last week,
[02:46:03.380 --> 02:46:09.380]  there was a response from the U.S. Trade Representative who said, he can go down and read the agreement.
[02:46:09.380 --> 02:46:13.380]  But what he didn't say is that he could not tell anyone what he had seen.
[02:46:13.380 --> 02:46:20.380]  He said, he can go take notes, but what he didn't tell you is that he cannot show those notes to anyone.
[02:46:20.380 --> 02:46:29.380]  That is the kind of railroading, and as I said, this is a formalization of the process that power has already been transferred.
[02:46:29.380 --> 02:46:32.380]  Now, they also go on to point out in this Guardian story, they say,
[02:46:32.380 --> 02:46:38.380]  notably absent from the list from this open letter that was signed by 250 technology companies,
[02:46:38.380 --> 02:46:46.380]  noticeably absent from that list are the big international tech companies like Apple, Google, Facebook,
[02:46:46.380 --> 02:46:53.380]  and he points out that Apple and AT&T are part of the President's International Trade Advisory Committee,
[02:46:53.380 --> 02:46:56.380]  which is involved in negotiating this.
[02:46:56.380 --> 02:47:04.380]  They say, of course, their representatives have presumably been able to read sections of the bill that would apply to their industry.
[02:47:04.380 --> 02:47:10.380]  Let me give you another quote from one of the people who is one of these technology companies that has signed this letter.
[02:47:10.380 --> 02:47:12.380]  This is from David Hansen.
[02:47:12.380 --> 02:47:15.380]  Now, he's written a program you may have seen, Basecamp.
[02:47:15.380 --> 02:47:18.380]  We've used that here at the office.
[02:47:18.380 --> 02:47:22.380]  He also has created a development platform, Ruby on Rails.
[02:47:22.380 --> 02:47:28.380]  He says, this is a mockery of democratic legislative ideals.
[02:47:28.380 --> 02:47:33.380]  It shrouded in secrecy exactly because it would wither in sunlight.
[02:47:33.380 --> 02:47:35.380]  Think about that. Let that sink in.
[02:47:35.380 --> 02:47:40.380]  It is shrouded in secrecy because it would wither in sunlight.
[02:47:40.380 --> 02:47:45.380]  Understand that it isn't just these secret trade deals.
[02:47:45.380 --> 02:47:53.380]  Virtually everything our government does is shrouded in secrecy because it would wither in sunlight.
[02:47:53.380 --> 02:47:55.380]  Virtually everything.
[02:47:55.380 --> 02:48:01.380]  The more our government spies on us, the more it ramps up the surveillance state,
[02:48:01.380 --> 02:48:09.380]  the more jealously they guard their secrets, their government secrets, their individual secrets.
[02:48:09.380 --> 02:48:13.380]  They become manic about guarding everything that they have.
[02:48:13.380 --> 02:48:19.380]  And again, this goes back to the other big issue that has been percolating for the last couple of weeks.
[02:48:19.380 --> 02:48:20.380]  Jade Helm.
[02:48:20.380 --> 02:48:23.380]  Understand that when they talk about mastering the human domain,
[02:48:23.380 --> 02:48:32.380]  they are talking about merging the nexus of the Homeland Security police state, the NSA surveillance state,
[02:48:32.380 --> 02:48:40.380]  the technology companies of the military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about, and now the military.
[02:48:40.380 --> 02:48:42.380]  Putting the special forces out there.
[02:48:42.380 --> 02:48:49.380]  Admiral McRaven was talking years ago about how they needed to return to their original mission of Psyops
[02:48:49.380 --> 02:48:57.380]  and controlling local governments, shutting down movements, anticipating movements, shutting them down before they happened.
[02:48:57.380 --> 02:48:59.380]  That is what is going on.
[02:48:59.380 --> 02:49:07.380]  We see in this mastering the human domain, that is the stated purpose of geospatial intelligence, of human domain analytics,
[02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:13.380]  all these technological buzzwords, this is the growth area of surveillance.
[02:49:13.380 --> 02:49:20.380]  Collect everything about you, everything about who you know, what you do, the groups you belong to, and your demographics.
[02:49:20.380 --> 02:49:25.380]  Make no mistake about it, there is a genocide component to this.
[02:49:25.380 --> 02:49:35.380]  Initially we are going to have political totalitarianism, but what grows out of that political totalitarianism is always a genocidal movement that grows out of that.
[02:49:35.380 --> 02:49:38.380]  We saw that happen with Nazi Germany as well.
[02:49:38.380 --> 02:49:46.380]  We need to be very concerned about the authoritarian secretive police state that is merging.
[02:49:46.380 --> 02:49:48.380]  And this is how you need to understand this.
[02:49:48.380 --> 02:49:55.380]  This is not just for foreigners anymore than the NSA or the CIA are about just watching foreigners either.
[02:49:55.380 --> 02:50:01.380]  Special forces are offering themselves as boots on the ground for the surveillance police state.
[02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:06.380]  That was the wording of Admiral McRaven a couple of years ago.
[02:50:06.380 --> 02:50:16.380]  Saying they needed physical boots on the ground to build their information database about the human domain in order to master it.
[02:50:16.380 --> 02:50:21.380]  See, first they master it politically, then the master race will appear.
[02:50:21.380 --> 02:50:24.380]  That is the long term plan of this.
[02:50:24.380 --> 02:50:26.380]  That is what you need to understand.
[02:50:26.380 --> 02:50:35.380]  The exercise of seeing how people are going to react to it, the mapping out of people, and once they map us out, those maps are not going away.
[02:50:35.380 --> 02:50:40.380]  Any more than that data that they're storing in Utah is going to go away.
[02:50:40.380 --> 02:50:47.380]  Stay with us. We're going to be right back and we're going to see what's happening there at the live rally in front of Planned Parenthood
[02:50:47.380 --> 02:50:51.380]  where the Red Guard Austin showed up to censor free speech.
[02:50:51.380 --> 02:50:53.380]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.

[02:54:07.380 --> 02:54:10.380]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight in the studio.
[02:54:10.380 --> 02:54:16.380]  Alex ran down to the protest in front of Planned Parenthood because we had a group that showed up.
[02:54:16.380 --> 02:54:19.380]  We now know that it was the Red Guard of Austin.
[02:54:19.380 --> 02:54:23.380]  We've matched pictures of several of the people there.
[02:54:23.380 --> 02:54:31.380]  Ironically, marching a few weeks ago between signs that held up the hammer and sickle and black lives matter.
[02:54:31.380 --> 02:54:36.380]  Our whole point in going to this rally was to tell people, yes, black lives do matter.
[02:54:36.380 --> 02:54:39.380]  They matter no matter how old those lives are.
[02:54:39.380 --> 02:54:46.380]  To try to educate people about the genocidal eugenics origins of Margaret Sanger, about her beliefs,
[02:54:46.380 --> 02:54:51.380]  about what she said, about the purpose of Planned Parenthood that she founded.
[02:54:51.380 --> 02:54:55.380]  Essentially, to attack specific groups and to shut them down.
[02:54:55.380 --> 02:54:59.380]  Now, as this rally was going peacefully, calmly people were holding up signs.
[02:54:59.380 --> 02:55:05.380]  This group showed up with black tarps holding them in front of other people's signs.
[02:55:05.380 --> 02:55:10.380]  See, they have nothing to say. They merely want to black out what you have to say.
[02:55:10.380 --> 02:55:16.380]  The only comments, we were able to get out of them where you are racist, you are sexist.
[02:55:16.380 --> 02:55:18.380]  That's it. No substantiation.
[02:55:18.380 --> 02:55:22.380]  That's the narrative that you continually see over and over again.
[02:55:22.380 --> 02:55:29.380]  And that's the way these astroturf groups that were funded by George Soros, as we pointed out yesterday.
[02:55:29.380 --> 02:55:32.380]  These astroturf groups that started this black lives matter.
[02:55:32.380 --> 02:55:37.380]  That is what they're trying to do is divide and conquer the population.
[02:55:37.380 --> 02:55:42.380]  It is a Marxist organization at the very core.
[02:55:42.380 --> 02:55:45.380]  That is what's behind this. Certainly black lives do matter.
[02:55:45.380 --> 02:55:47.380]  We want to see police brutality stopped.
[02:55:47.380 --> 02:55:53.380]  We want to have a conversation about the legitimate use of the police and the legitimate use of force.
[02:55:53.380 --> 02:56:01.380]  We want accountability in the police department because as Frank Cipriko, the guy behind the movie that you've probably seen with Al Pacino,
[02:56:01.380 --> 02:56:04.380]  as he's pointed out many times, in any organization.
[02:56:04.380 --> 02:56:07.380]  It's not just the police. It's any human organization.
[02:56:07.380 --> 02:56:09.380]  You're going to have good people and bad people.
[02:56:09.380 --> 02:56:14.380]  The question about the organization is will they purge the bad people?
[02:56:14.380 --> 02:56:17.380]  Will they punish people when they do the wrong thing?
[02:56:17.380 --> 02:56:20.380]  So we need to make sure that our police departments do that.
[02:56:20.380 --> 02:56:25.380]  But we were at this rally to point out to people that black lives matter at all ages.
[02:56:25.380 --> 02:56:29.380]  To point out what is going on with Planned Parenthood and the roots of it.
[02:56:29.380 --> 02:56:35.380]  And of course they showed up, censored it, Alex ran to the protest.
[02:56:35.380 --> 02:56:41.380]  Once he got there, they disappeared and then they came back as a group screaming, excuse me, assaulting people,
[02:56:41.380 --> 02:56:46.380]  grabbed the microphone, cut or broke the cable, damaged one of the microphones and ran off.
[02:56:46.380 --> 02:56:48.380]  So they're sorting that out now with the police.
[02:56:48.380 --> 02:56:50.380]  We're going to have an update on that tonight on the Nightly News.
[02:56:50.380 --> 02:56:56.380]  If you're not a Nightly News subscriber, please consider doing that and supporting our operation.
[02:56:56.380 --> 02:57:00.380]  You will get the information that shows up a day or so later on YouTube.

[02:57:02.380 --> 02:57:06.380]  So tonight we're going to have an update as to what's going on at this rally.
[02:57:06.380 --> 02:57:12.380]  Also we skipped several commercial breaks during this program because of this breaking news.
[02:57:12.380 --> 02:57:15.380]  Just want to let you know that there are 72 hours left on our summer sale.
[02:57:15.380 --> 02:57:19.380]  The all new Supermail Vitality is now 20% off.

[02:57:20.380 --> 02:57:21.380]  This is your last chance.
[02:57:21.380 --> 02:57:24.380]  72 hours left on this sale.
[02:57:24.380 --> 02:57:27.380]  Again, read the reviews on InfowarsLife.com.

[02:57:56.380 --> 02:58:00.380]  Again, as I pointed out, we have a story that's up on Infowars.com.
[02:58:00.380 --> 02:58:02.380]  If you want to see, this is a perfect metaphor.
[02:58:02.380 --> 02:58:07.380]  These people showing up and using black tarps to try to cover up other people's free speech.
[02:58:07.380 --> 02:58:09.380]  It wasn't that they had anything to say.
[02:58:09.380 --> 02:58:12.380]  They just don't want you to know the truth.
[02:58:12.380 --> 02:58:15.380]  They don't want you to know the origins of Planned Parenthood.
[02:58:15.380 --> 02:58:17.380]  But it's going to come out.
[02:58:17.380 --> 02:58:22.380]  And now we have a beautiful picture of exactly what they're doing.
[02:58:22.380 --> 02:58:23.380]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:58:23.380 --> 02:58:26.380]  Join us again tomorrow at 11 Central.
[02:58:26.380 --> 02:58:27.380]  Oh, we're going to go into overdrive.
[02:58:27.380 --> 02:58:28.380]  I think Alex is going to be with us.
[02:58:28.380 --> 02:58:29.380]  So just hang on.
[02:58:29.380 --> 02:58:48.380]  If you're online, we're going to be right back in overdrive.
[02:58:59.380 --> 02:59:02.380]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[02:59:02.380 --> 02:59:06.380]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:06.380 --> 02:59:11.380]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:11.380 --> 02:59:18.380]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfowarsLife.com.

[02:59:23.380 --> 02:59:25.380]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:25.380 --> 02:59:30.380]  As down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly
[02:59:30.380 --> 02:59:32.380]  to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:32.380 --> 02:59:36.380]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[02:59:51.380 --> 02:59:55.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.380 --> 03:00:08.380]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.380 --> 03:00:12.380]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:12.380 --> 03:00:23.380]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:00:23.380 --> 03:00:26.380]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us. He is on the way back to the studio.
[03:00:26.380 --> 03:00:31.380]  He's returning from the Black Lives Matter demonstration at Planned Parenthood.
[03:00:31.380 --> 03:00:33.380]  We believe that Black Lives really do matter.
[03:00:33.380 --> 03:00:36.380]  We believe that Black Lives Matter no matter what the age.
[03:00:36.380 --> 03:00:43.380]  But the protest was, they attempted to shut it down. They didn't shut it down. It's still going.
[03:00:43.380 --> 03:00:48.380]  But we had people from the Red Guard Austin, Communist agitators, if you will.
[03:00:48.380 --> 03:00:53.380]  I know that's almost a cliche phrase, but if it fits, wear it.
[03:00:53.380 --> 03:00:56.380]  These people showed up, tried to shut down the protesters.
[03:00:56.380 --> 03:01:01.380]  When Alex came, they cut the microphone, they ran off, they damaged the microphone,
[03:01:01.380 --> 03:01:04.380]  so he was there talking to the police about what had happened.
[03:01:04.380 --> 03:01:09.380]  He is on his way back. That is the way they deal with you.
[03:01:09.380 --> 03:01:11.380]  They try to shut your free speech down.
[03:01:11.380 --> 03:01:16.380]  That is the characteristics that you see over and over again of the authoritarians.
[03:01:16.380 --> 03:01:18.380]  They don't want you to have informed consent.
[03:01:18.380 --> 03:01:23.380]  The same people who try to present themselves as pro-choice when it comes to abortion,
[03:01:23.380 --> 03:01:27.380]  they say, I want people to be able to make that decision for themselves.
[03:01:27.380 --> 03:01:31.380]  But they don't want you to have information about what is really going on.
[03:01:31.380 --> 03:01:37.380]  They don't want you to see the 4D pictures, ultrasound pictures of the baby and the womb.
[03:01:37.380 --> 03:01:41.380]  They don't want you to know the origins of Planned Parenthood.
[03:01:41.380 --> 03:01:46.380]  They don't want you to know about Margaret Sanger, darling of the Ku Klux Klan,
[03:01:46.380 --> 03:01:51.380]  Adolf Hitler, honored by him because she worked to eliminate groups
[03:01:51.380 --> 03:01:56.380]  that she considered to be inferior to the group that she belonged to.
[03:01:56.380 --> 03:02:04.380]  Yes, eugenics and genocide, those are at the heart of the master race mentality of Adolf Hitler.
[03:02:04.380 --> 03:02:08.380]  Genocide is the technique of removing one particular group.
[03:02:08.380 --> 03:02:12.380]  And I'm going over this because we just had a guy who was at the protest saying,
[03:02:12.380 --> 03:02:16.380]  when I talk to people I know and talk to them about eugenics,
[03:02:16.380 --> 03:02:18.380]  talk to them about Margaret Sanger, they've never heard of her.
[03:02:18.380 --> 03:02:20.380]  They don't understand what eugenics is.
[03:02:20.380 --> 03:02:25.380]  Eugenics essentially was, say, we're going to improve the human race.
[03:02:25.380 --> 03:02:28.380]  Meaning EU, meaning good and genetics, okay?
[03:02:28.380 --> 03:02:35.380]  It was something that was created by a relative of Charles Darwin.
[03:02:35.380 --> 03:02:38.380]  But the way that they say they're going to improve the human race
[03:02:38.380 --> 03:02:43.380]  is by eliminating or sterilizing people that they don't approve of.
[03:02:43.380 --> 03:02:48.380]  Jews, blacks, whatever the group happens to be at the given time.
[03:02:48.380 --> 03:02:50.380]  There's always going to be a group.
[03:02:50.380 --> 03:02:53.380]  That's the way they keep themselves in power.
[03:02:53.380 --> 03:02:59.380]  Going after the foreigner, going after the ones among us who look different in some way.
[03:02:59.380 --> 03:03:01.380]  That's the way they keep power.
[03:03:01.380 --> 03:03:04.380]  You know, when we talk about what is going on with Jade Helm,
[03:03:04.380 --> 03:03:07.380]  we talk about what's going on with the NSA and the surveillance state.
[03:03:07.380 --> 03:03:09.380]  We hear from them that you're just promoting fear.
[03:03:09.380 --> 03:03:13.380]  No, the people who are promoting fear are the ones who are promoting
[03:03:13.380 --> 03:03:16.380]  and creating the police surveillance state.
[03:03:16.380 --> 03:03:22.380]  Joining us now is Alex Jones getting back from the rally and pulling up the microphone.
[03:03:22.380 --> 03:03:25.380]  It's been quite a day, Alex.
[03:03:25.380 --> 03:03:29.380]  I'm in the building, but that was energizing, I tell you.
[03:03:29.380 --> 03:03:32.380]  And I'm sorry, some people don't like it the fact that I love Jesus,
[03:03:32.380 --> 03:03:38.380]  but praise the Lord fighting those demons and seeing those actual vampire ringwraiths
[03:03:38.380 --> 03:03:40.380]  and one that was actually possessed.
[03:03:40.380 --> 03:03:43.380]  He could get a job in like those twilight shows or whatever,
[03:03:43.380 --> 03:03:46.380]  as like a lower Wrenfield type.
[03:03:46.380 --> 03:03:49.380]  Just flopping around and hissing at people.
[03:03:49.380 --> 03:03:53.380]  And we now have video, I don't know how much it went out while they're like, Satan, Satan, Hail Satan.
[03:03:53.380 --> 03:03:56.380]  And they weren't joking around, just like at the Capitol.
[03:03:56.380 --> 03:04:03.380]  I mean, we faced the gutter demons that would slither up to protect that black sacrificial altar
[03:04:03.380 --> 03:04:05.380]  that they've got right up the street from here.
[03:04:05.380 --> 03:04:08.380]  Oh, absolutely. And you talk about being a sacrificial altar,
[03:04:08.380 --> 03:04:11.380]  I think a lot of people don't realize that child sacrifice,
[03:04:11.380 --> 03:04:14.380]  which is rampant throughout the Middle East,
[03:04:14.380 --> 03:04:20.380]  it was Malak where people would pass their children through the fire thinking that it was going to bring them prosperity.
[03:04:20.380 --> 03:04:25.380]  And that's precisely the way that many people have been deceived with this Planned Parenthood agenda.
[03:04:25.380 --> 03:04:27.380]  That's one of the things that they throw at people.
[03:04:27.380 --> 03:04:29.380]  They say, you can't afford to have a kid.
[03:04:29.380 --> 03:04:31.380]  It's going to cost you too much over the child's lifetime.
[03:04:31.380 --> 03:04:34.380]  So you need to sacrifice them to this.
[03:04:34.380 --> 03:04:38.380]  And so they can then raise more taxes, give you a 200 square foot coffin house.
[03:04:38.380 --> 03:04:42.380]  They want you to have less so they can siphon off more and control you.
[03:04:42.380 --> 03:04:45.380]  Sure, some of the stuff we do is wasteful. Some of the energy is bad.
[03:04:45.380 --> 03:04:49.380]  There's real problems, but their solutions always centralize power for them
[03:04:49.380 --> 03:04:52.380]  and somebody loses and then you get something.
[03:04:52.380 --> 03:04:54.380]  We're going to be back. I'm going to do one segment with you.
[03:04:54.380 --> 03:04:56.380]  You're welcome to keep going with other news if you want for the full hour.
[03:04:56.380 --> 03:04:58.380]  Overdrive David or punch out.
[03:05:00.380 --> 03:05:02.380]  Hi, John Humner from Midas Resources.
[03:05:02.380 --> 03:05:05.380]  Are you tired of watching your hard earned assets dwindle away?
[03:05:05.380 --> 03:05:10.380]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of 20 billion a week,
[03:05:10.380 --> 03:05:13.380]  are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard earned money?
[03:05:13.380 --> 03:05:17.380]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[03:05:17.380 --> 03:05:22.380]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[03:05:22.380 --> 03:05:25.380]  This is John Humner and that was me in 2007.
[03:05:25.380 --> 03:05:29.380]  And we all know what happened when the subprime credit bubble burst.
[03:05:29.380 --> 03:05:32.380]  By March 2009, the dollar lost 50% of its value.
[03:05:32.380 --> 03:05:35.380]  The entire U.S. banking system was on the verge of collapsing.
[03:05:35.380 --> 03:05:39.380]  Like all financial problems of the past, is history about to repeat itself?
[03:05:39.380 --> 03:05:46.380]  Call me John Humner at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129 before it's too late to protect yourself.
[03:05:46.380 --> 03:05:50.380]  Will the oncoming catastrophe take all private IRAs 401Ks with it?
[03:05:50.380 --> 03:05:53.380]  There is a way to protect your hard earned assets.
[03:05:53.380 --> 03:05:58.380]  Call me John Humner at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[03:05:59.380 --> 03:06:00.380]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:06:00.380 --> 03:06:01.380]  Good brother.

[03:06:38.380 --> 03:06:44.380]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience
[03:06:44.380 --> 03:06:50.380]  where stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[03:07:02.380 --> 03:07:07.380]  It's true some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.

[03:08:20.380 --> 03:08:25.380]  Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Alex Jones, riding shotgun with David Knight and Leanne McAdee.
[03:08:25.380 --> 03:08:32.380]  Leanne seemed very, very excited whenever she was sending me text messages when I was driving back from the Black Lives Matter demonstration
[03:08:32.380 --> 03:08:38.380]  that was just going to be something to point out that the majority of black folks getting killed before they're born are totally innocent
[03:08:38.380 --> 03:08:44.380]  and we know they're being killed and we know it's part of a Margaret Sanger, Rockefeller, literal Nazi combine.
[03:08:44.380 --> 03:08:52.380]  I mean, that's the stuff of a Captain America novel. This stuff is all really going on and we go out there.
[03:08:52.380 --> 03:08:57.380]  They attack us. They call us names. They tell us they love Satan.
[03:08:57.380 --> 03:09:04.380]  We find their Facebook page and it is them promoting communism and they say, no, they haven't. We're crazy.
[03:09:04.380 --> 03:09:09.380]  I mean, literal Decepticon weasels that I've never seen the likes of.
[03:09:09.380 --> 03:09:19.380]  Similar. This is what comes up from under the rocks when you go out and see how their attacks now draw attention to how the so-called left,
[03:09:19.380 --> 03:09:27.380]  the Salatarian left is shutting down free speech everywhere, is going after our basic freedoms everywhere and then claiming the moral high ground saying we hate women
[03:09:27.380 --> 03:09:37.380]  and we hate black people. Certainly we get that women having kids and not having access to birth control and things like that is a violation of their rights
[03:09:37.380 --> 03:09:41.380]  and some folks on the really far right say don't even let them have that. I don't agree with that.
[03:09:41.380 --> 03:09:46.380]  But the people that said don't give them birth control 60 years ago said next it'll be abortion.
[03:09:46.380 --> 03:09:49.380]  Then it'll be old people. Then it'll be children. Now it is.
[03:09:49.380 --> 03:09:55.380]  So I see that argument on both sides and women that have had abortions. I'm not judging you. I've told the story many times.
[03:09:55.380 --> 03:10:04.380]  I have to get it off my chest again here that when I was young, I had girlfriends and things and they would tell me I'm getting an abortion
[03:10:04.380 --> 03:10:14.380]  and a few times I'd say well no, we shouldn't do that and then their parents will get involved or whatever and then they get convinced that you don't want me to have a kid
[03:10:14.380 --> 03:10:23.380]  and I just didn't fight hard enough when I was 16 years old and when I was 20 years old and then I promised that I would never be part of it again if I,
[03:10:23.380 --> 03:10:31.380]  obviously I was somewhat promiscuous, got a woman pregnant and I lived by that and thank God if I had known back then what I know now about shoulder,
[03:10:31.380 --> 03:10:38.380]  I never would have been involved in that. So I'm not on some high horse and a lot of people have had abortions or they've been involved then and so they commit to it.
[03:10:38.380 --> 03:10:43.380]  That's how they corrupt you with any corruption. You get into it, now you start defending it.
[03:10:43.380 --> 03:10:54.380]  When you can see all of these case point examples, there was a fellow out there after we were off the air who came out and I'd actually met him at a broken spoke event
[03:10:54.380 --> 03:11:04.380]  a year ago, a listener and he came out and he said in theory you could say socialism or abortion is going to help people but always in practice it creates a nightmare
[03:11:04.380 --> 03:11:16.380]  and that's absolutely true. We should say that more because it is true historically and show those examples but it is energizing to see their handler who was driving a black Jaguar,
[03:11:16.380 --> 03:11:26.380]  a brand new black Jaguar and they were all vampire out and dropping them off, picking them up and to see them hissing and hating and being mean to old ladies
[03:11:26.380 --> 03:11:32.380]  and just vicious and giggling when we talk about dead kids and then looking at me and we have it on tape, I don't know if it went out live,
[03:11:32.380 --> 03:11:40.380]  we have it actually going I am a Satanist and I love Satan and it's just like spontaneously not women and goth because all goths aren't bad.
[03:11:40.380 --> 03:11:49.380]  Obviously it's just a style but not women and goth, women that look like the lady next door that makes cookies spontaneously a few years ago the Texas legislature
[03:11:49.380 --> 03:11:59.380]  when they were about to ban partial birth abortion began to go, hey, oh, Satan, Satan, Satan and it was all around these Christians and they were just channeling the energy going, oh, Satan,
[03:11:59.380 --> 03:12:15.380]  oh, because you're talking about 56 million executed chopped up children at the bottom of this rabbit hole is the soul sucking energizing death and the same look in those women's eyes of sticking their tongues out and going,
[03:12:15.380 --> 03:12:29.380]  oh, oh, oh, oh, getting off on the power of the death going on inside that building, it was incredible. And so we just experienced that so here it is.
[03:12:29.380 --> 03:12:36.380]  Pro abortionist admit they love Satan installing. Okay, you've got that.
[03:12:36.380 --> 03:12:49.380]  Communist group. We confirm you say we've seen the Facebook it's them. And we hope you have screenshots right now. Oh, yeah. Communist group attacks black lives matter abortion demonstration.
[03:12:49.380 --> 03:12:56.380]  There's their red guard Facebook. I guess that was the guy I saw marching and already have footage downtown myself. Yeah, well, these are busy beavers.
[03:12:56.380 --> 03:13:01.380]  The guard of the bearded guy are info warriors are busy taking over their Facebook page.
[03:13:01.380 --> 03:13:09.380]  They've commandeered the Facebook page leaving all sorts of comments. And by the way, that red guard I ran to them in New York, that red guard, they're all over the place.
[03:13:09.380 --> 03:13:11.380]  Oh, that was the girl was out there, isn't it? Yes, that's him.
[03:13:11.380 --> 03:13:21.380]  Look at that guy donate capitalism. Yeah, he's got the American flag upside down and that written across. By the way, they were being dropped off and stuff in a brand new Jaguar probably cost twice what my dodge card is.
[03:13:21.380 --> 03:13:28.380]  They're like, look at you capitalist. Look at the guard to pledge their allegiance. That's her. That's one of the ones that they question but didn't arrest.
[03:13:28.380 --> 03:13:34.380]  So that's all another issue hammer and sickle. And there's the black lives matter sign. Here's the thing is that they're on their page.
[03:13:34.380 --> 03:13:42.380]  A lot of people are saying Alex, we're so angry at you. How dare you use the black lives matter movement to push a pro life agenda.
[03:13:42.380 --> 03:13:49.380]  Meanwhile, they're using the black lives matter movement to push a communist agenda and race war. Yeah, the communists want to have a violent overthrow.
[03:13:49.380 --> 03:13:55.380]  That's why George Soros is funding it. The communists won't actually get power though. They'll be double crossed in the end.
[03:13:55.380 --> 03:14:02.380]  I mean, it's great. And the Austin police could have arrested them. They spent like 45 minutes talking to them and talking to other people out there.
[03:14:02.380 --> 03:14:13.380]  Well, the damage your property. I mean, they broke microphones. There's video of them helping the guy climb a fence to get away that did who did the majority of the assault and the cop looked at it.
[03:14:13.380 --> 03:14:21.380]  Now, Ferris the police, he said no, something is going to happen to them. Something is going to be done just not today. Well, and I've got his name right here.
[03:14:21.380 --> 03:14:29.380]  I mean, he's probably knows my God, I've been arrested for bullhorning. I've been arrested for peacefully demonstrating by the DPS, the DPS offices.
[03:14:29.380 --> 03:14:35.380]  They better arrest these people. I mean, these are they were laughing and giggling. I mean, it was it was just sickening.
[03:14:35.380 --> 03:14:52.380]  Gil Gil Ermo Salinas badge number 4733 senior police officer. And then they had a sergeant Tate. I think a big black guy. I shook his hand. It was like his hand was like rebar steel that caught. I was just like, oh my God, this guy's got the hardest hands I've ever touched.
[03:14:52.380 --> 03:15:01.380]  It was like literal shaking Optimus Prime's hand or he was like, Mr. Jones, hope you have a nice day. So the cops were nice. But still, they should have arrested them.
[03:15:01.380 --> 03:15:08.380]  Why do you think they didn't arrest them? I'm not sure. Maybe they want to get them on bigger charges based on what their groups.
[03:15:08.380 --> 03:15:14.380]  Well, yeah, when they saw the footage of them helping him run and all that, they were like, I don't know what's going to happen, but it was amazing.
[03:15:14.380 --> 03:15:21.380]  Well, the thing I think that's important, Alex, is, first of all, what we saw before you even went out there, what made you mad? The reason you went out there was because they show up.
[03:15:21.380 --> 03:15:27.380]  They have nothing to say. They simply want to shut down your speech. They're all about censorship. They're commies.
[03:15:27.380 --> 03:15:32.380]  They're going to fail. They grab your microphone and try to destroy your microphone because they just want to shut people up.
[03:15:32.380 --> 03:15:45.380]  They have nothing to say except the tired old stereotypes of racism, sexism, and what they're doing is they're discrediting real charges of racism by continually misusing that crying wolf about it.
[03:15:45.380 --> 03:15:48.380]  That's right. Leigh Ann, your observations have been ranting.
[03:15:48.380 --> 03:15:55.380]  Well, I just, I don't, why do they want to turn the United States into China? You know, is that their ideal?
[03:15:55.380 --> 03:16:02.380]  I mean, my God, it's total to telepherianism. These people, listen, listen, when I first got there, like, these people are vampire wannabes.
[03:16:02.380 --> 03:16:09.380]  And then the Satan, we love Satan. And then a guy who had transparent, my dad calls him, see in the dark or glow in the dark people.
[03:16:09.380 --> 03:16:10.380]  Right.
[03:16:10.380 --> 03:16:20.380]  Because I've known real, real Satanist or if they're not, they're being influenced by it and don't know it, that archetype, whatever, is he had glowing, green, translucent skin.
[03:16:20.380 --> 03:16:22.380]  You know, he'd never been out in the sun.
[03:16:22.380 --> 03:16:25.380]  He's just like, he was.
[03:16:25.380 --> 03:16:28.380]  Just trying to, like a zombie trying to protect the death base.
[03:16:28.380 --> 03:16:29.380]  Yeah.
[03:16:29.380 --> 03:16:34.380]  Well, it's just really strange when you would go over and try to engage them, they would just, they would say nothing.
[03:16:34.380 --> 03:16:35.380]  Right.
[03:16:35.380 --> 03:16:39.380]  Is Rob do out there? Can we get a feed of him? Or I just see Rob do John on the screen over there.
[03:16:39.380 --> 03:16:42.380]  Like we're little push-ins or little puppies or whatever you call him.
[03:16:42.380 --> 03:16:52.380]  I'm not saying that. I'm saying you can't go around killing babies and saying it's for women's health because killing babies is not for women's health.
[03:16:52.380 --> 03:16:55.380]  There's a lot of other adverse reactions that could happen when women do get abortions.
[03:16:55.380 --> 03:17:05.380]  So look into all that for yourself. Check out blackgenocide.org, check out infowars.com and hashtag Black Lives Matter because we think that all lives matter, but especially Black Lives Matter.
[03:17:05.380 --> 03:17:06.380]  They're really scared of this.
[03:17:06.380 --> 03:17:11.380]  And they are the ones who are getting the full brunt of this abortion industry.
[03:17:11.380 --> 03:17:13.380]  All right, thank you, Dave.
[03:17:13.380 --> 03:17:16.380]  Yeah, I think it's shooting a report, but...
[03:17:16.380 --> 03:17:31.380]  Anyways, if these spread and we take over their Black Lives Matter thing that's meant to actually cause a race war, so Obama can then be the savior, you know, riding on a white horse, if we hijack it, it can really save a lot of lives.
[03:17:31.380 --> 03:17:32.380]  I feel really bad for them.
[03:17:32.380 --> 03:17:38.380]  They want to start a race war and we could stop a race war if we get people to understand what Planned Parenthood is about.
[03:17:38.380 --> 03:17:41.380]  In other words, they're using Black Lives Matter.
[03:17:41.380 --> 03:17:42.380]  Planned Parenthood's the real race war.
[03:17:42.380 --> 03:17:43.380]  Exactly.
[03:17:43.380 --> 03:17:48.380]  I mean, 56 million people and 17 million of them are Black.
[03:17:48.380 --> 03:17:51.380]  I mean, the Klan didn't kill a million Black people.
[03:17:51.380 --> 03:17:52.380]  That's right.
[03:17:52.380 --> 03:17:53.380]  That's right.
[03:17:53.380 --> 03:17:54.380]  Of course, that's what...
[03:17:54.380 --> 03:17:55.380]  Well, I guess they did.
[03:17:55.380 --> 03:17:56.380]  They helped set up Planned Parenthood.
[03:17:56.380 --> 03:17:57.380]  I guess they did, hell.
[03:17:57.380 --> 03:17:58.380]  That's the headline.
[03:17:58.380 --> 03:18:00.380]  Klan killed 16 million Blacks.
[03:18:00.380 --> 03:18:01.380]  Left offends it.
[03:18:01.380 --> 03:18:03.380]  So Soros is trying to start a race war.
[03:18:03.380 --> 03:18:07.380]  We're trying to expose that one has been going on for 40 years.
[03:18:07.380 --> 03:18:09.380]  Founder of Planned Parenthood.
[03:18:09.380 --> 03:18:11.380]  Margaret Sanger, she was very clear about it.
[03:18:11.380 --> 03:18:18.380]  You know, I finally decided if the guy shoved me and pinched me and hit on me one more time, that zombie guy was going to punch him in the jaw full power.
[03:18:18.380 --> 03:18:21.380]  And right at that moment, your car just jumps in front of him and lets him run into him.
[03:18:21.380 --> 03:18:22.380]  I'm proud of your car.
[03:18:22.380 --> 03:18:28.380]  But I tell you, I really, I mean, I was just asking, I didn't want him to win because then they claimed that I hit him.
[03:18:28.380 --> 03:18:29.380]  Of course, he'd have been hurt.
[03:18:29.380 --> 03:18:31.380]  Cops will take the jail whoever hurts somebody.
[03:18:31.380 --> 03:18:33.380]  I wanted to punch that vampire so bad.
[03:18:33.380 --> 03:18:38.380]  I just know that jaw would have.
[03:18:38.380 --> 03:18:44.380]  There's also that really big guy that you talked to and he says, yep, we're not going to, we're not going to be goaded into doing that.
[03:18:44.380 --> 03:18:47.380]  We're going to not take the bait that they're trying to offer us.
[03:18:47.380 --> 03:18:49.380]  We're going to just stand, you know, stand them down.
[03:18:49.380 --> 03:18:50.380]  That's what he did as well.
[03:18:50.380 --> 03:18:51.380]  Yeah.
[03:18:51.380 --> 03:18:53.380]  And that guy was probably like 240 pounds of solid muscle.
[03:18:53.380 --> 03:18:54.380]  Yeah.
[03:18:54.380 --> 03:18:55.380]  Oh yeah.
[03:18:55.380 --> 03:18:56.380]  Yeah.
[03:18:56.380 --> 03:18:57.380]  Yeah.
[03:18:57.380 --> 03:18:58.380]  He was much bigger than those guys.
[03:18:58.380 --> 03:19:03.380]  So we're into like not getting in fights and they have to be controlling it like Joe Rogan, people attack him, which he's not, not that big a guy.
[03:19:03.380 --> 03:19:05.380]  They just slam into the wall, throw him in the ground.
[03:19:05.380 --> 03:19:06.380]  Yeah.
[03:19:06.380 --> 03:19:10.380]  On fear factor, repeatedly Joe would get attacked and he just, you know, just direct him into the wall or into the ground.
[03:19:10.380 --> 03:19:11.380]  Me, I don't know how to do all that.
[03:19:11.380 --> 03:19:13.380]  I just knocked people upside the head.
[03:19:13.380 --> 03:19:16.380]  I know you were like, come on, come on, bump into me one more time.
[03:19:16.380 --> 03:19:19.380]  I was like, no, please don't, don't bump into him.
[03:19:19.380 --> 03:19:24.380]  Then he did it a couple more times and I could, but the last thing I just couldn't, but I saw him smiling like he was going to get what he wanted.
[03:19:24.380 --> 03:19:26.380]  I went, oh, I'm just, you know.
[03:19:26.380 --> 03:19:27.380]  Yeah.
[03:19:27.380 --> 03:19:28.380]  That's our whole thing.
[03:19:28.380 --> 03:19:29.380]  Just anarchic.
[03:19:29.380 --> 03:19:31.380]  It felt good though.
[03:19:31.380 --> 03:19:32.380]  Yeah.
[03:19:32.380 --> 03:19:33.380]  I'm not into violence, but vampires.
[03:19:33.380 --> 03:19:35.380]  I mean, it would just be so satisfying.
[03:19:35.380 --> 03:19:37.380]  Alex Jones, a vampire slayer.
[03:19:37.380 --> 03:19:38.380]  Oh my God.
[03:19:38.380 --> 03:19:41.380]  I mean, well, he, this is a demon.
[03:19:41.380 --> 03:19:42.380]  I mean, a literal demon.
[03:19:42.380 --> 03:19:45.380]  If you guys want to come back and do one more segment, put bookends on this.
[03:19:45.380 --> 03:19:46.380]  Sure.
[03:19:46.380 --> 03:19:47.380]  We can do that.
[03:19:47.380 --> 03:19:48.380]  We'll get all these videos and articles up.
[03:19:48.380 --> 03:19:49.380]  Great job, everybody.
[03:19:49.380 --> 03:19:54.380]  I'm going to go do some accounting work and try to get the TV network system launched, but we're on the marks.
[03:19:54.380 --> 03:19:58.380]  The empire's on the run. Thanks for all your support. When we come back, we've got a lot to do.
[03:19:58.380 --> 03:19:59.380]  Yeah.
[03:19:59.380 --> 03:20:01.380]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[03:21:58.380 --> 03:22:00.380]  So we decided to upgrade the look of our home.
[03:22:00.380 --> 03:22:02.380]  You know, improve the curve appeal.
[03:22:02.380 --> 03:22:05.380]  We decided to add the look of stone to the exterior.
[03:22:05.380 --> 03:22:07.380]  We really like the stacked stone look.
[03:22:07.380 --> 03:22:11.380]  Yeah, but when I checked into the price, it was ridiculous. No way could we afford it.
[03:22:11.380 --> 03:22:16.380]  Then a friend told me about Genstone. G-E-N-S-T-O-N-E.
[03:22:16.380 --> 03:22:19.380]  Genstone comes in lightweight panels made of polyurethane.
[03:22:19.380 --> 03:22:22.380]  They've actually engineered the hassle out of installation.
[03:22:22.380 --> 03:22:25.380]  No mortar, no mesh. It was easy. Even I could do it.
[03:22:25.380 --> 03:22:28.380]  We just screwed the panels to the wall and it looks like stone.
[03:22:28.380 --> 03:22:30.380]  I mean, it really looks like stone.
[03:22:30.380 --> 03:22:32.380]  Yeah, from the box to the wall in minutes.
[03:22:32.380 --> 03:22:34.380]  We love the look of our home now.
[03:22:34.380 --> 03:22:40.380]  And Genstone is durable, comes with a 25-year warranty and offers additional R value for insulation.

[03:22:57.380 --> 03:23:01.380]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[03:23:01.380 --> 03:23:07.380]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[03:23:07.380 --> 03:23:13.380]  It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:23:13.380 --> 03:23:19.380]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984,
[03:23:19.380 --> 03:23:23.380]  and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933,
[03:23:23.380 --> 03:23:27.380]  some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[03:23:27.380 --> 03:23:33.380]  For this reason, Mitus Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[03:23:33.380 --> 03:23:36.380]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Mitus Resources or not,
[03:23:36.380 --> 03:23:39.380]  I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[03:23:39.380 --> 03:23:43.380]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:43.380 --> 03:23:46.380]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[03:23:46.380 --> 03:23:49.380]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:49.380 --> 03:23:52.380]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[03:23:52.380 --> 03:23:55.380]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:55.380 --> 03:24:02.380]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and joining me in the studio is Leanne McAdoo.
[03:24:02.380 --> 03:24:05.380]  We're going to put some bookends on what happened today.
[03:24:05.380 --> 03:24:07.380]  It's been an amazing live broadcast.
[03:24:07.380 --> 03:24:11.380]  Before I do, because it was of everything that was going on with this live broadcast,
[03:24:11.380 --> 03:24:14.380]  we did very few commercials.
[03:24:14.380 --> 03:24:16.380]  We skipped some commercials.
[03:24:16.380 --> 03:24:19.380]  We skipped some commercials.
[03:24:19.380 --> 03:24:25.380]  There are 72 hours left on the summer sale of the new Superfemale Vitality.
[03:24:25.380 --> 03:24:29.380]  You can get 20% off for just 72 hours more.
[03:24:29.380 --> 03:24:31.380]  Again, read the reviews.
[03:24:31.380 --> 03:24:34.380]  We have hundreds of five-star reviews on InfowarsLife.com,
[03:24:34.380 --> 03:24:41.380]  and you can get Supermale and Superfemale Vitality for 20% off for just another 72 hours.
[03:24:41.380 --> 03:24:45.380]  And of course, you can get Superfemale and Superfemale Vitality.
[03:24:45.380 --> 03:24:49.380]  For 20% off for just another 72 hours.
[03:24:49.380 --> 03:24:51.380]  And of course, that supports our operation.
[03:24:51.380 --> 03:24:53.380]  Helps to get free speech out there.
[03:24:53.380 --> 03:24:55.380]  And this is what this is all about, isn't it, Leanne?
[03:24:55.380 --> 03:24:59.380]  This is about the reason Alex left the studio and went down to the demonstration
[03:24:59.380 --> 03:25:06.380]  was because these people from Red Guard Austin showed up not to exercise their free speech,
[03:25:06.380 --> 03:25:10.380]  not to say what they believe, but to shut down the free speech of others,
[03:25:10.380 --> 03:25:14.380]  literally taking black tarps and holding them up over people's signs.
[03:25:14.380 --> 03:25:18.380]  And they would not speak except to say once or twice it's racism,
[03:25:18.380 --> 03:25:22.380]  it's anti-women, all this kind of stuff.
[03:25:22.380 --> 03:25:25.380]  But these are the people who are, you were telling me on Facebook,
[03:25:25.380 --> 03:25:27.380]  they say, come learn about Stalin.
[03:25:27.380 --> 03:25:29.380]  Right. They hold a weekly meetings.
[03:25:29.380 --> 03:25:32.380]  In one of the weekly meetings, there's a picture of it there.
[03:25:32.380 --> 03:25:36.380]  It says, come to the meeting this week and learn about our young comrade Stalin.
[03:25:36.380 --> 03:25:41.380]  So they're wanting to teach people about the young Stalin and the young Mao.
[03:25:41.380 --> 03:25:44.380]  Free mass murder.
[03:25:44.380 --> 03:25:49.380]  It's not surprising that the people who are holding up as idols, people like Stalin,
[03:25:49.380 --> 03:25:52.380]  people like Mao, who have created massive democides,
[03:25:52.380 --> 03:25:56.380]  killing millions, tens of millions of people in the 20th century,
[03:25:56.380 --> 03:26:01.380]  that they would also show up at Planned Parenthood in support of the genocide
[03:26:01.380 --> 03:26:03.380]  going on against black people.
[03:26:03.380 --> 03:26:06.380]  That was the purpose of creating that organization.
[03:26:06.380 --> 03:26:11.380]  The founder, Margaret Singer, specifically set it up for a black genocide.
[03:26:11.380 --> 03:26:14.380]  There's many quotes about her saying that.
[03:26:14.380 --> 03:26:16.380]  That's what we're trying to educate people about.
[03:26:16.380 --> 03:26:19.380]  We want people to come learn about Margaret Singer,
[03:26:19.380 --> 03:26:21.380]  come learn about Planned Parenthood,
[03:26:21.380 --> 03:26:24.380]  and at the same time, learn about Stalin, learn about Mao,
[03:26:24.380 --> 03:26:26.380]  understand the democide that was going on
[03:26:26.380 --> 03:26:28.380]  and continues to go on in places like China
[03:26:28.380 --> 03:26:30.380]  where they have one child policy and forced abortion.
[03:26:30.380 --> 03:26:33.380]  It's kind of divine intervention that it was that particular group
[03:26:33.380 --> 03:26:37.380]  that decided to show up because now we can, right in your face,
[03:26:37.380 --> 03:26:40.380]  we can expose how these Soros-led groups
[03:26:40.380 --> 03:26:43.380]  are infiltrating the Black Lives Matter movement.
[03:26:43.380 --> 03:26:45.380]  They're on their Facebook page.
[03:26:45.380 --> 03:26:48.380]  Their supporters are yelling back and forth with our supporters,
[03:26:48.380 --> 03:26:52.380]  who by the way, info warriors, dominate their Facebook page.
[03:26:52.380 --> 03:26:54.380]  But they're going back and forth saying,
[03:26:54.380 --> 03:26:59.380]  how dare you use the Black Lives Matter movement to push your pro-life agenda.
[03:26:59.380 --> 03:27:03.380]  But they're using it to push a communist agenda.
[03:27:03.380 --> 03:27:06.380]  How does that even work?
[03:27:06.380 --> 03:27:10.380]  If Black Lives Matter, why wouldn't they really matter at a young age?
[03:27:10.380 --> 03:27:12.380]  Of course, it is all based on lies.
[03:27:12.380 --> 03:27:14.380]  They don't try to argue with anybody.
[03:27:14.380 --> 03:27:16.380]  They simply want you to come to their meeting
[03:27:16.380 --> 03:27:20.380]  so you will hear only one side of their narrative,
[03:27:20.380 --> 03:27:22.380]  their false narrative about Stalin.
[03:27:22.380 --> 03:27:25.380]  That is just as false as the narrative that we're hearing from the GOP
[03:27:25.380 --> 03:27:27.380]  from Marco Rubio and Peter King
[03:27:27.380 --> 03:27:31.380]  when they flat out deny that the NSA is collecting your information.
[03:27:31.380 --> 03:27:33.380]  They are lying to you.
[03:27:33.380 --> 03:27:35.380]  That's one of the techniques.
[03:27:35.380 --> 03:27:37.380]  Of course, they want to try to shut people down with censorship,
[03:27:37.380 --> 03:27:39.380]  but of course the other thing is to not debate the issue,
[03:27:39.380 --> 03:27:43.380]  but just to repeat emphatically an obvious lie.
[03:27:43.380 --> 03:27:45.380]  That's what we see from the government all the time.
[03:27:45.380 --> 03:27:48.380]  We see it from the GOP as well as from the Democrats,
[03:27:48.380 --> 03:27:52.380]  especially from these communists at the Red Guard Austin.
[03:27:52.380 --> 03:27:55.380]  What are they telling people that it's going to be better
[03:27:55.380 --> 03:27:58.380]  if the USA becomes Cuba?
[03:27:58.380 --> 03:28:01.380]  Looks like our fans just hijacked their Facebook.
[03:28:01.380 --> 03:28:03.380]  That's what we're saying, Aaron.
[03:28:03.380 --> 03:28:05.380]  That's what we're dominating.
[03:28:05.380 --> 03:28:07.380]  As you can see on the screen, it's our fans
[03:28:07.380 --> 03:28:11.380]  putting up commercials about how to go to the InfoWars store
[03:28:11.380 --> 03:28:13.380]  and buy stuff.
[03:28:13.380 --> 03:28:17.380]  Here's what the Red Guards really were.
[03:28:17.380 --> 03:28:19.380]  Here's what they support.
[03:28:19.380 --> 03:28:21.380]  They don't want to show up and have that discussion
[03:28:21.380 --> 03:28:23.380]  when we put the microphone in their face
[03:28:23.380 --> 03:28:25.380]  at the demonstration.
[03:28:25.380 --> 03:28:28.380]  They would not talk about that because they want to put forth
[03:28:28.380 --> 03:28:31.380]  their false narrative in a venue
[03:28:31.380 --> 03:28:34.380]  where nobody is going to challenge them about that.
[03:28:34.380 --> 03:28:38.380]  Of course, we need to understand the nexus of the surveillance state,
[03:28:38.380 --> 03:28:41.380]  of censorship, of genocide.
[03:28:41.380 --> 03:28:43.380]  All these things come together.
[03:28:43.380 --> 03:28:45.380]  They're always pushed by the same people,
[03:28:45.380 --> 03:28:48.380]  just as we see the so-called pro-choice legislators
[03:28:48.380 --> 03:28:51.380]  who are pushing informed consent
[03:28:51.380 --> 03:28:55.380]  being banned from people, forcing you to take vaccines
[03:28:55.380 --> 03:28:58.380]  without your consent, without any information about what's in it.
[03:28:58.380 --> 03:29:01.380]  That's the kind of authoritarian mindset that we see,
[03:29:01.380 --> 03:29:04.380]  and that's what whistleblowers like William Benny have pointed out.
[03:29:04.380 --> 03:29:09.380]  Peter King and Marco Rubio, you need to listen to William Benny.
[03:29:09.380 --> 03:29:11.380]  He's been there.
[03:29:11.380 --> 03:29:15.380]  He was the head, the global head of the technology side of the NSA.
[03:29:15.380 --> 03:29:19.380]  He said, I watched the authoritarian police states
[03:29:19.380 --> 03:29:23.380]  in East Germany and the Soviet Union, and we have become that.
[03:29:23.380 --> 03:29:25.380]  It's not even a question.
[03:29:25.380 --> 03:29:27.380]  Peter King says, we're just spreading fear.
[03:29:27.380 --> 03:29:29.380]  You know who's spreading fear?
[03:29:29.380 --> 03:29:32.380]  The people who are selling this authoritarian police state
[03:29:32.380 --> 03:29:35.380]  are the ones who justify it by spreading fear.
[03:29:35.380 --> 03:29:38.380]  They tell you, give up your liberties for security.
[03:29:38.380 --> 03:29:39.380]  Useful idiots.
[03:29:39.380 --> 03:29:40.380]  That's right.
[03:29:40.380 --> 03:29:42.380]  Join us tonight for the Infowars Nightly News.
[03:29:42.380 --> 03:29:45.380]  Leanne is going to be hosting, and we're going to have some updates
[03:29:45.380 --> 03:29:46.380]  on what happened.
[03:29:46.380 --> 03:29:48.380]  We'll encapsulate that and show you the clips.
[03:29:48.380 --> 03:29:49.380]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.380 --> 03:30:18.380]  The empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
