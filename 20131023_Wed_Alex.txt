[00:00.000 --> 00:12.180]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.180 --> 00:20.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:36.320]  well Obamacare's implosion meltdown is so unbelievably off the chart I don't
[00:36.320 --> 00:40.280]  even know what to say I mean I know they have disdain for their followers I
[00:40.280 --> 00:43.320]  know they want to wreck the economy and consolidate it and wreck us like a third
[00:43.320 --> 00:49.800]  world nation this is what venture vulture anti-capitalist monopoly men do
[00:49.800 --> 00:54.360]  but I cannot even believe that they're throwing 300,000 people off their
[00:54.360 --> 01:00.120]  healthcare plans in Florida hundreds of thousands in places like California tens
[01:00.120 --> 01:05.640]  of thousands in places like Tennessee the average premium is more than doubled
[01:05.640 --> 01:11.440]  it's set to double again in the next two years no one can enroll on healthcare
[01:11.440 --> 01:15.920]  gov the few idiots that thought they had just thought that they'd you know had
[01:15.920 --> 01:20.360]  sent off for a Nigerian email by the way I've been saying this is like the
[01:20.360 --> 01:24.360]  Nigerian email scam for about three weeks and Ted Cruz started saying that
[01:24.360 --> 01:28.160]  yesterday and I know Ted Cruz is folks listen to the show so we love it and
[01:28.160 --> 01:32.400]  none of its none of its trademarked or copyrighted only in full wars calm and
[01:32.400 --> 01:36.600]  stuff like that so knock yourselves out no they're all tuning in the broadcast
[01:36.600 --> 01:41.840]  because that's what it is the problem is as I predicted like the Nigerian email
[01:41.840 --> 01:46.720]  scams folks are gonna keep doubling and tripling and quadrupling down and
[01:46.720 --> 01:53.240]  they're not gonna get mad at obozo and his controllers because he is Christ to
[01:53.240 --> 01:59.160]  them he's Obama obozo the guy that opens his mouth and flies fly out like it's a
[01:59.160 --> 02:03.920]  horror movie everywhere he goes people pass out there's a smell of sulfur in
[02:03.920 --> 02:07.800]  the area reportedly not kidding that's and and flies coming out of his mouth
[02:07.800 --> 02:12.840]  like he's got a latrine in there or something but for us we hate his guts
[02:12.840 --> 02:18.040]  but for the follower I'm telling you folks he could stab them in the eyes
[02:18.040 --> 02:21.920]  with ice picks and they would help help grab his hand and ram the ice pick in
[02:21.920 --> 02:26.400]  begging because their whole world is about being failures and losers and
[02:26.400 --> 02:30.120]  being conned by the way I walked in a restaurant last night to pick up food
[02:30.120 --> 02:36.320]  for my family because my my wife was out and so I was gonna bring some food home
[02:36.320 --> 02:42.720]  and a guy opens the door walks out past me and says don't let this guy in here
[02:42.720 --> 02:46.360]  and I thought he was joking and then he was like bugging his eyes out at me
[02:46.360 --> 02:51.560]  freaked out and had a totally trendy gait about him and his whole demeanor and
[02:51.560 --> 02:56.000]  and my gaydar was going off as well and I'm not against that guy because he was
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.000]  if I mean if he wasn't gay then Liberace wasn't but the whole point was he
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.480]  obviously thinks I don't like Obama so I hate gay people which is not the case I
[03:04.480 --> 03:08.280]  mean I'm not obsessed with it all day like the Democratic Party is and then
[03:08.280 --> 03:12.840]  uses it as like the the new culture or whatever I don't like it being pushed on
[03:12.840 --> 03:16.520]  kids I don't like any sex being pushed on kids I don't like Jocelyn elders you
[03:16.520 --> 03:20.280]  know saying reach down and help them do it and in that pervert voice of hers we've
[03:20.280 --> 03:25.800]  got to help the little ones I mean that creeps me out wouldn't it was an old
[03:25.800 --> 03:29.520]  black lady or a white guy whatever keep your hands off the children's you know
[03:29.520 --> 03:34.400]  you know what I mean I mean you're got your government crazy people the point is
[03:34.400 --> 03:39.240]  is that this guy really looked at me like he wanted to attack me like like
[03:39.240 --> 03:43.240]  the door had swung open and there was the hostess right there and Satan
[03:43.240 --> 03:48.680]  himself had had entered in I'm sorry flies aren't landing all over me or
[03:48.680 --> 03:54.200]  coming out of my mouth or spontaneously combusting or generating out of my
[03:54.200 --> 03:59.400]  rumpus actually that's where flies come from did you know that kids when Obama
[03:59.400 --> 04:04.160]  goes to the bathroom just trillions of fly eggs spew out and he sprays it all
[04:04.160 --> 04:08.360]  over the wall like a Pollock painting and then bureaucrats hatch out and fly
[04:08.360 --> 04:15.480]  off okay okay I gotta stop right there we have a family audience I you got the
[04:15.480 --> 04:19.680]  idea from the CNN bathrooms well no no I didn't know that Obama's actually been
[04:19.680 --> 04:24.120]  in that studio he did that artwork that's why they didn't remove the crap
[04:24.120 --> 04:28.800]  splattered all over the walls at the CNN restroom was because that's an original
[04:28.800 --> 04:31.360]  who's the guy that paints in New York and London the people are mad when they
[04:31.360 --> 04:37.000]  paint over it he's a great artist what's his name he does like Bank Banksy yeah
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.680]  yeah you don't paint over that you don't paint over an Obama explosive birth of
[04:42.680 --> 04:48.240]  flies I mean that's what goes on and in fact in fact he's actually not Satan
[04:48.240 --> 04:51.760]  he's the devil's wife and those are his babies all right I'm gonna stop with the
[04:51.760 --> 04:55.680]  potty humor I know Carl Rove's probably listening really enjoying it we're gonna

[09:17.440 --> 09:23.440]  are free Madison Avenue Wall Street Hollywood the globalist our social
[09:23.440 --> 09:31.080]  engineers that are manipulating you and your family and the minute you begin to
[09:31.080 --> 09:34.520]  figure that out and feel self-confident and stop caring what the
[09:34.520 --> 09:40.720]  establishment thinks and stop being cowardly is the minute you start becoming
[09:40.720 --> 09:45.200]  free again from any of you have never been free and brought up inside the

[10:09.440 --> 10:13.520]  realize that and liberate yourself from this fraudulent system there is a
[10:13.520 --> 10:19.920]  revolution going on of awakening and I want you to be part of it especially if
[10:19.920 --> 10:24.000]  you're a new listener I want to open the phones up today for people that
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.920]  disagree with me on Obamacare or on any of these big issues or for folks that
[10:30.920 --> 10:36.960]  have any questions or comments people that would like to be inquisitors folks
[10:36.960 --> 10:43.360]  that would like to ask me questions the toll-free number to join us is 800 25
[10:43.360 --> 10:50.800]  9 92 31 800 25 9 92 31 and I will start going to your calls by the next segment
[10:50.800 --> 10:55.600]  or I've instructed the crew I think we actually will put shock bracelets on me
[10:55.600 --> 11:00.760]  they will deliver a shock first only annoying and then up to painful and then
[11:00.760 --> 11:05.320]  lethal if I don't go to your calls early when I give the number out and of course
[11:05.320 --> 11:09.880]  I'm being sarcastic that would probably actually just in a pure voyeuristic type
[11:09.880 --> 11:13.960]  situation make more folks tune to the show to actually learn about liberty so
[11:13.960 --> 11:18.600]  maybe maybe it is a good idea if I actually wear a shock bracelet because
[11:18.600 --> 11:22.640]  after all Homeland Security three years ago I actually had high-level meetings
[11:22.640 --> 11:28.160]  with the Homeland Security director looking at making all passengers where
[11:28.160 --> 11:33.360]  taser bracelets that can knock you out to get on a plane and they are now
[11:33.360 --> 11:36.680]  looking at that yet again and now police departments everywhere when they even
[11:36.680 --> 11:42.200]  detain you or pull you over they're now moving to make you wear a taser bracelet
[11:42.200 --> 11:47.000]  or collar up just for my safety will you wear this while we stay right there and
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  you're like you're joking no I'm not joking if I told you 15 years ago they
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.280]  were gonna take your children away from you at the airport and grab their
[11:54.280 --> 12:01.240]  genitals Jocelyn elders dream would actually coming true would you believe
[12:01.240 --> 12:05.400]  it would you believe that there's declassified government documents that
[12:05.400 --> 12:13.040]  they put hydrofluorosalic acid and other systems of fluoride in the water to dumb
[12:13.040 --> 12:17.960]  you down lower your fertility it's all on record I mean if I told you they
[12:17.960 --> 12:20.840]  injected tens of thousands of black people with syphilis and let them
[12:20.840 --> 12:24.000]  spread it to hundreds of thousands died screw shading towards your deaths over
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.640]  45 years would you believe it because it's true what I tell you right now
[12:27.640 --> 12:31.400]  they're grabbing foster kids in New York and testing pesticides on them till
[12:31.400 --> 12:36.840]  they die comes out in the New York Daily News nobody gets in trouble if I told
[12:36.840 --> 12:40.280]  you they're putting cancer viruses in all the major vaccines that are tested
[12:40.280 --> 12:43.760]  would you go look it up and find out it's true no no you wouldn't do that
[12:43.760 --> 12:48.320]  because then you couldn't go get drunk after work and watch football and not
[12:48.320 --> 12:52.160]  care about anything I think you should go get drunk and fight the new world
[12:52.160 --> 12:55.280]  order anyways I'm being sarcastic little bit of humor here today maybe I'm not
[12:55.280 --> 12:59.400]  hey whatever it takes folks they should drink some rum for they wanted to
[12:59.400 --> 13:03.080]  combat on naval ships a couple you know just a little bit just enough to really
[13:03.080 --> 13:09.640]  get wild the point here is ladies and gentlemen is that we need folks out there
[13:09.640 --> 13:14.200]  to wake up to the false bubble we've been putting in and they're now trying to
[13:14.200 --> 13:17.280]  force more and more people into that bubble and there's a rebellion against
[13:17.280 --> 13:23.440]  that happening on a planetary scale and I want to salute everyone who is
[13:23.440 --> 13:26.320]  breaking out of the matrix look I don't know if we can totally trust people like
[13:26.320 --> 13:31.200]  Ted Cruz or Rand Paul I believe in Rand Paul known him for a long time think he's
[13:31.200 --> 13:34.680]  a million times better than Diane Feinstein and you know folks like that
[13:34.680 --> 13:39.040]  that are coming after our guns but regardless we need to support them
[13:39.040 --> 13:42.240]  because they've got the whole system coming after him right now the
[13:42.240 --> 13:46.760]  establishment Republicans the bluebloods the insiders but but separate from them
[13:46.760 --> 13:51.440]  you know you're good you need to run for city council you need to run for state
[13:51.440 --> 13:57.000]  rep you need to run for governor a lot of times you'll end up reaching hundreds
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.520]  of thousands of not millions of people just in the process of running for state
[14:00.520 --> 14:04.720]  office tens of thousands running for city your county office and then if you
[14:04.720 --> 14:10.640]  run a couple times you may end up winning I'm not going to go off into
[14:10.640 --> 14:15.120]  solutions again I want to give the number out 800-25-99-231 we've got a
[14:15.120 --> 14:19.760]  lot of news coming up today and we have John Corbett who fights the TSA his own
[14:19.760 --> 14:25.800]  way getting simulated bombs through to show what a fraudulent system it is now
[14:25.800 --> 14:34.240]  he has been threatened by the injustice department when we published off of the
[14:34.240 --> 14:42.960]  federal court registry that someone inexplicably we don't know who published
[14:42.960 --> 14:48.160]  it he can't do that his lawyer can't do that someone either on purpose or by
[14:48.160 --> 14:51.040]  accident I think on purpose because there's good people inside the federal
[14:51.040 --> 14:55.600]  government leaking and standing up it's happening more and more and the TSA in
[14:55.600 --> 15:01.800]  federal court with him in a lawsuit admitting it's not for terrorists it's
[15:01.800 --> 15:09.240]  for the American people and for dog training this is in the documents and we
[15:09.240 --> 15:13.960]  actually had somebody else in tip send us the info and then we have the same
[15:13.960 --> 15:17.080]  thought when this came out like a week ago I said hey who's that guy that it's
[15:17.080 --> 15:20.160]  always fighting them we ought to get him on this is what he said a long time ago
[15:20.160 --> 15:24.160]  and then he goes well I don't know if I can I just got threatened by the Justice
[15:24.160 --> 15:33.040]  Department so so in America they told him he can't talk his name is John Corbett
[15:33.040 --> 15:36.640]  about what's public here's the Don Salazar's article from last week should
[15:36.640 --> 15:39.560]  have gotten national attention it didn't get a lot of attention because who cares
[15:39.560 --> 15:43.640]  about you know incredible documents getting leaked onto the federal website
[15:43.640 --> 15:46.720]  and you know this should be on every news channel this should have been the top
[15:46.720 --> 15:51.840]  news story DOJ censors blogger for documents they release what we put that
[15:51.840 --> 15:56.960]  out last Thursday blogger harassed by government for speaking about public
[15:56.960 --> 16:03.880]  documents so we probably had him on the show ten times over the years and so we
[16:03.880 --> 16:07.000]  we call to get him on he goes I don't know if I can they're threatening me
[16:07.000 --> 16:14.320]  basically with arrest if I speak about these documents so there you go ladies
[16:14.320 --> 16:22.120]  and gentlemen and again it's it's not his fault the truth got released it's
[16:22.120 --> 16:26.760]  got a good-looking website that's what I want our new website to look like oh
[16:26.760 --> 16:31.720]  that's the official TSA website well no no I mean that's actually the font we're
[16:31.720 --> 16:35.200]  going with in the look of the new info wars and the new prison planet everybody
[16:35.200 --> 16:38.240]  wants to get a look at it that's what it looks like so when I said that's what I
[16:38.240 --> 16:42.320]  want that's actually a stumbling of the words that's that's actually what we're
[16:42.320 --> 16:46.800]  going to have so that's a good clean look folks want that that's what they're
[16:46.800 --> 16:49.440]  gonna get in between all the others shenanigans going on around here I'm
[16:49.440 --> 16:57.040]  trying to get that done right now with our great team now with the whole IT crew
[16:57.040 --> 17:01.720]  and Tim Frosier and Kurt Nemo Han showing that but that's a side issue that's
[17:01.720 --> 17:06.720]  coming up at the bottom of the next hour now again here's some of the headlines

[24:18.160 --> 24:21.560]  to go to your calls as promised and we're gonna air that excerpt from the
[24:21.560 --> 24:26.440]  interview coming up where the SEAL veteran Navy SEAL veteran military
[24:26.440 --> 24:30.240]  leaders are being asked if they will disarm Americans litmus test includes
[24:30.240 --> 24:34.320]  question of whether top brass are comfortable with firing on US citizens
[24:34.320 --> 24:38.160]  and Watson God bless him he's awesome didn't get that exactly right I meant
[24:38.160 --> 24:42.080]  to call Watson about that but when you guys do that I'll do some editing here
[24:42.080 --> 24:45.600]  on air so I worked with him on the story last night Watson's just a dynamo
[24:45.600 --> 24:54.480]  best I've got it wasn't top brass top brass are talking to NCOs top brass are
[24:54.480 --> 25:00.560]  calling in NCOs non-commissioned officers master sergeants and down and
[25:00.560 --> 25:05.760]  asking will you pull triggers on the American people but I mean again we
[25:05.760 --> 25:09.640]  already know that it's in Forbes the Washington Times we broke it army
[25:09.640 --> 25:14.200]  documents I mean they've got public speeches that army war college gives
[25:14.200 --> 25:18.200]  about this it's just that they've always had insurrection plans any government
[25:18.200 --> 25:21.160]  should if there was an illegitimate insurrection or whatever this is we're
[25:21.160 --> 25:25.960]  going to go after the gun owners we're going to engage in treason this is your
[25:25.960 --> 25:29.440]  government's been taken over we're in deep trouble and and this is what I've
[25:29.440 --> 25:33.240]  been hammering for 15 16 years since I learned about this plan I didn't know
[25:33.240 --> 25:36.940]  about this the first few years on air since I learned about and by the way
[25:36.940 --> 25:40.720]  here's the good news and I'll go to your calls Clinton tried this as well it
[25:40.720 --> 25:44.640]  didn't fly now here's the problem when they don't succeed they try try again
[25:44.640 --> 25:48.400]  that's why the globalists are winners when it comes to dominating and control
[25:48.400 --> 25:53.400]  they're bad people they're spiritual losers but they are material devilish
[25:53.400 --> 25:58.120]  of this world winners they are winners Hitler was a winner until he got
[25:58.120 --> 26:03.000]  destroyed under the world system Genghis Khan was a winner Stalin was a
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.960]  winner under this under the devil systems their winners they're really
[26:07.960 --> 26:12.600]  losers in the final equation but they have the knowledge of domination and
[26:12.600 --> 26:17.720]  control they have the they have the information but not the wisdom they
[26:17.720 --> 26:21.800]  don't see 50 steps down even five steps down or they don't care or they like the
[26:21.800 --> 26:25.120]  destruction it brings they like the recklessness of it that's really the
[26:25.120 --> 26:29.680]  secret of where evil gets a lot of its best men is they're not even totally
[26:29.680 --> 26:33.800]  evil at the end of the day they just enjoy the black dark flame of wickedness
[26:33.800 --> 26:41.400]  it warms their soul I know I've got a wicked streak a trillion miles wide like
[26:41.400 --> 26:46.040]  everybody else and I but I I know that knowledge is there the point is and I
[26:46.040 --> 26:53.680]  digress the point isn't I digress is that when one looks into the abyss be
[26:53.680 --> 26:57.760]  careful that you not become the abyss as Nietzsche as Nietzsche said Nietzsche
[26:57.760 --> 27:02.200]  also said when men cease to be men women will become men that's actually how it
[27:02.200 --> 27:05.640]  is and all the million lines and that's actually coming true and it's all been
[27:05.640 --> 27:11.600]  done by design with the government as the alpha male it is the male the women
[27:11.600 --> 27:17.400]  are the the the the beta males under the chief under Sauron under the New World
[27:17.400 --> 27:22.240]  Order and the issue here is this time under Obama they've gotten the military
[27:22.240 --> 27:26.240]  to go a lot further and they set up Homeland Security and they've got it
[27:26.240 --> 27:29.920]  trained and flipped from fighting al-Qaeda as we always told you it wasn't for
[27:29.920 --> 27:35.120]  al-Qaeda to write on to George Washington Thomas Jefferson John Wayne mom
[27:35.120 --> 27:40.760]  apple pie private property the family I mean it's all denounced publicly they
[27:40.760 --> 27:45.040]  should all be arrested for the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center propaganda
[27:45.040 --> 27:50.080]  that they have not even rewritten and adopted as official in-service training
[27:50.080 --> 27:55.080]  for all police that if you're friendly to the police you're a terrorist if you're
[27:55.080 --> 27:58.120]  mean to the police you're a terrorist if you're mad about being searched you're
[27:58.120 --> 28:03.320]  a terrorist how about you're just not a slave how about the people doing this or
[28:03.320 --> 28:06.720]  the terrorist how about the globalist hijacking our country and shutting off
[28:06.720 --> 28:09.760]  our industry how about you're the terrorist we're going to break short
[28:09.760 --> 28:14.880]  segment I'm coming back rampaging through your calls it's just I start
[28:14.880 --> 28:20.280]  thinking about how close we are to totally imploding into martial law mass
[28:20.280 --> 28:24.840]  arrest and tyranny but also how close we are to having this blow up in their
[28:24.840 --> 28:29.400]  face politically and reversing it and gaining a bunch of ground back that's
[28:29.400 --> 28:32.600]  why you have to believe there are good people in the system because I know
[28:32.600 --> 28:36.720]  they are you've got to be cynical you've got to go after folks that are bad but
[28:36.720 --> 28:41.800]  you've also got to give people a chance like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and others
[28:41.800 --> 28:46.200]  that are trying to do the best job they can if we own them if we take them over
[28:46.200 --> 28:50.880]  if we support them they will be ours they will have backup from us and they
[28:50.880 --> 28:57.200]  will be the men I know Rand Paul is up in that barrel of snakes could you go up
[28:57.200 --> 29:00.840]  there and not sell out I will guarantee you there are very few that couldn't I
[29:00.840 --> 29:05.920]  will assure you that I could go there and not sell out but it would be hard
[29:05.920 --> 29:14.080]  believe me it would be hard very hard very hard they have ways and the point
[29:14.080 --> 29:20.400]  here is that but don't just count on folks like that you have to become the
[29:20.400 --> 29:24.120]  William Barrett Travis politically you have to become the George Washington and
[29:24.120 --> 29:30.120]  believe me you've got the medal it takes to do it but we're on the razor's edge
[29:30.120 --> 29:34.200]  you could go either way and that's what's so dynamic frustrating horrifying
[29:34.200 --> 29:39.600]  invigorating dynamic exciting about it well can you feel it we have entered the
[29:39.600 --> 29:48.240]  zone the crossroads the fulcrum the jump point we are now in that magic place I'm

[36:46.760 --> 36:51.080]  the info wars nightly news tonight it is the most incredible gun footage I have
[36:51.080 --> 36:58.120]  ever seen when Shane Steiner at about 200 yards is hand-holding the about 175
[36:58.120 --> 37:02.960]  yards hand-holding the 50 and he empties two clips of 10 rounds with the
[37:02.960 --> 37:08.400]  Barrett and it's the heavy Marine Corps version and he he line of sight misses
[37:08.400 --> 37:12.880]  the first shot and then like pounds nine into this dead tree like pieces of it
[37:12.880 --> 37:17.640]  blowing off and then loads another misses again but uses it like line of
[37:17.640 --> 37:21.640]  sights I forgot it's tracers to but it's daytime so it's like white laser beams
[37:21.640 --> 37:27.480]  and then we had these exploding armor piercing ones it's just amazing I love
[37:27.480 --> 37:33.440]  America that's all I can say oh my gosh the problem was my back was already out
[37:33.440 --> 37:39.200]  and I got to go to a chiropractor right after the show cuz I think I I don't
[37:39.200 --> 37:42.720]  think my dad checked it this morning he's pretty smart he said yeah I got one
[37:42.720 --> 37:47.320]  of my disc bulging out it's all swollen back here and of course I was the first
[37:47.320 --> 37:49.720]  to shoot it when you see me get up there I don't know what's gonna go on free hand
[37:49.720 --> 37:54.280]  cuz I've shot you know single-shot grizzly quite a bit freehand but I was
[37:54.280 --> 37:59.640]  it wasn't as bad a kick except holding it out there I had into my side and so I
[37:59.640 --> 38:03.640]  kind of blew my back out extra that's a new back therapy go shoot like 30 rounds
[38:03.640 --> 38:09.640]  yourself freehand with a Barrett 50 cal long barrel and then grab the Coast Guard
[38:09.640 --> 38:16.360]  Navy version and fire it some and then grab M4s emptying clips and then Desert
[38:16.360 --> 38:24.200]  Eagle 44s and then you get a Navy Seal 308 Reaper and fire that and then
[38:24.200 --> 38:27.400]  I'm sorry I said I'd go to your phone calls ladies and gentlemen I apologize I
[38:27.400 --> 38:32.480]  realized why I'm feeling so good I just love shooting guns and I love watching
[38:32.480 --> 38:36.280]  the video of it when this comes out I will guarantee you people are gonna want
[38:36.280 --> 38:40.440]  to watch it 20 times I just want to go back there and I always never said I
[38:40.440 --> 38:43.520]  petted guns and like got into them themselves it's like shooting a self
[38:43.520 --> 38:48.000]  defense and hunting and stuff I actually with these 50s it's not like smog the
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.240]  dragon sits on piles of gold I may actually create a man cave somewhere
[38:52.240 --> 38:58.040]  where I just lay around on piles of 50 calibers and Lapua's and brass because I
[38:58.040 --> 39:02.920]  do think it almost like a dragon sits on gold because it makes them more clairvoyant
[39:02.920 --> 39:09.240]  I think I might need to sit on piles of high-caliber weapons all right I think
[39:09.240 --> 39:16.320]  MSNBC will have a heyday with that I'm just being honest anyways okay we're
[39:16.320 --> 39:22.480]  gonna go to your phone calls here all hell's breaking loose obviously with the
[39:22.480 --> 39:26.760]  power structure right now I don't actually believe I'm gonna become more
[39:26.760 --> 39:30.880]  clairvoyant sitting on a pile of 50 calibers actually I do but for the
[39:30.880 --> 39:35.480]  proviso I'm being more sarcastic there right now let's go ahead and go to your
[39:35.480 --> 39:38.560]  phone calls I apologize for ranting I'm going to call us earlier than usual
[39:38.560 --> 39:45.080]  Jeff in Texas you're on the air sir and welcome to the airwaves thank you Alex
[39:45.080 --> 39:48.520]  thanks for taking my call I'm a longtime listener first-time call I want to
[39:48.520 --> 39:51.840]  congratulate you on your fine work and your fine crew you guys you're doing a
[39:51.840 --> 39:54.680]  great job you're keeping everybody informed and that's what needs to happen
[39:54.680 --> 39:57.760]  well we're red-blooded and we're alive and we're not giving in to the spirit
[39:57.760 --> 40:02.000]  of the new world to roll over and die that's what I'm talking about yes it is
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.120]  disgusting the way the state-run media demonizes Rand Paul and Cruz these
[40:07.120 --> 40:10.680]  guys are out there fighting for our liberties and we need to stand behind
[40:10.680 --> 40:14.600]  them as you mentioned earlier I agree and I'm not bashing Curt and Emma who
[40:14.600 --> 40:17.240]  wrote an article about it yesterday because I respect Curt and he's a smart
[40:17.240 --> 40:20.600]  guy but he just declaratively thinks that they're double agents are going to
[40:20.600 --> 40:24.120]  stab us in the back and I just don't think there's enough evidence of that
[40:24.120 --> 40:28.760]  especially with Rand Paul what I've known for 17 18 years you know interviewing
[40:28.760 --> 40:31.480]  him and stuff for his dad when his dad was running for Congress I'm probably one
[40:31.480 --> 40:34.640]  of the first people to ever interview Rand Paul and I just know he's for real
[40:34.640 --> 40:38.520]  now they may compromise him especially you know how a lot of people get
[40:38.520 --> 40:41.160]  compromised they try to do the right thing and then people don't back them
[40:41.160 --> 40:45.420]  and then they go well if you're not gonna help me then okay I will join Darth
[40:45.420 --> 40:49.240]  Vader you know and so that's what I'm saying and I almost thought about getting
[40:49.240 --> 40:51.480]  Curt interdicts wrote an article about it yes that was pretty good article
[40:51.480 --> 40:54.040]  overall except I don't think you can I think you could say we need to watch
[40:54.040 --> 40:58.480]  out hold their feet to the fire make sure they're good but regardless let's
[40:58.480 --> 41:03.800]  say they weren't even good or perfect who is the idea of that of a libertarian
[41:03.800 --> 41:08.160]  movement taking over the Republican Party has the Republican leadership scared
[41:08.160 --> 41:11.600]  to death and Kurt wrote the article saying that's some time what I really
[41:11.600 --> 41:14.360]  disagree with in the article and curtain come in later if he wants to debate it
[41:14.360 --> 41:19.440]  with me is that what I really disagree with is saying that when Carl Rove and
[41:19.440 --> 41:23.200]  the Republican leadership and John McCain go after him that that's some
[41:23.200 --> 41:27.560]  type of foil because they're really double agents no they hate them and they
[41:27.560 --> 41:30.640]  don't want them taking over the Republican Party I mean I know the
[41:30.640 --> 41:34.520]  highest levels of Democratic connections Republican connections these people
[41:34.520 --> 41:37.800]  hate each other folks they're all battling for control different
[41:37.800 --> 41:40.800]  Democratic groups hate the Clintons the Clintons are still at the top of the
[41:40.800 --> 41:44.640]  heat because they've got all the blackmail info I'm telling you Rand Paul
[41:44.640 --> 41:49.800]  is good Ted Cruz is good and we need to make them continue to be good we would
[41:49.800 --> 41:53.880]  have gotten our guns restricted and probably a civil war if it wasn't for
[41:53.880 --> 41:58.640]  them in the Senate I mean we ought to literally be very thankful but regardless
[41:58.640 --> 42:03.120]  we can take the idea of those guys and prototype that to have everybody run at
[42:03.120 --> 42:06.640]  the state level and take the country back I'm sorry I'm ranting go ahead
[42:06.640 --> 42:12.080]  here's the way I feel with MSNBC and the way they demonized you that you had
[42:12.080 --> 42:16.720]  ties to the Boston bombing it just made me sick okay I was just like yeah but
[42:16.720 --> 42:20.000]  some logic would say that means I'm bad because they're really trying to promote
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.240]  me no they're trying to destroy me they don't have they don't have private
[42:24.240 --> 42:27.080]  detectives digging around in my life for because they want to give me kisses I
[42:27.080 --> 42:30.880]  mean you know again I've had the experience of being famous being well
[42:30.880 --> 42:34.800]  known knowing I'm totally real and people just not believing that anyone
[42:34.800 --> 42:38.960]  could be real and that's a problem with the corruption you got you you got a
[42:38.960 --> 42:43.360]  bunch of things going on here but on one end of it things are so corrupt and
[42:43.360 --> 42:48.200]  Obama is pimping people publicly so bad and and and abusing them we see sheep
[42:48.200 --> 42:51.600]  like followers that blindly follow so then we don't believe anybody could be
[42:51.600 --> 42:55.440]  good and see then that's the other extreme of then trusting nothing and
[42:55.440 --> 43:00.600]  just pulling out of everything instead of taking over see I know history I know
[43:00.600 --> 43:04.400]  we can take over and restore things and there's gonna be problems the same
[43:04.400 --> 43:08.960]  corruption is gonna pop right back up again it's an eternal fight just like
[43:08.960 --> 43:12.000]  sucking air into your lungs just like raising kids just like getting out of
[43:12.000 --> 43:16.640]  bed life is about your eyes going bad and your back going out and still getting
[43:16.640 --> 43:20.600]  up still living and the kids doing the dog crapping on the floor and going to
[43:20.600 --> 43:24.040]  grocery store and going and helping your family and going to old family members
[43:24.040 --> 43:28.040]  when they die and burying them it's all about a struggle and then success in life
[43:28.040 --> 43:32.080]  is the struggle and being alive and being involved and being honorable and
[43:32.080 --> 43:35.480]  being an example for others that's what I'm saying I don't blame people that are
[43:35.480 --> 43:40.120]  cynical but I'm telling you you out there who are leaders you know you're
[43:40.120 --> 43:44.760]  good so get out there and take action go ahead sir I'm ranting oh that's okay I
[43:44.760 --> 43:50.720]  was an NCO in the army back in 1989 I was in the special weapons department and
[43:50.720 --> 43:55.760]  nuclear biological chemical defense trainer out there at Fort Hood and I
[43:55.760 --> 43:59.760]  think the military's waking up to what's going on I saw Obama speech last night
[43:59.760 --> 44:04.720]  on the YouTube it just made I don't know how this guy expects to pull this off
[44:04.720 --> 44:09.080]  how did they expect to pull it off Alex the way they're treating people I've
[44:09.080 --> 44:11.680]  got to be honest I think they're gonna start a major war they already tried it
[44:11.680 --> 44:16.000]  in Syria and they're gonna stage false flags and blame us and our job is to
[44:16.000 --> 44:20.400]  get that info out show that our people are everywhere when they stage it will
[44:20.400 --> 44:24.640]  instantly be able to get the intel out like the Boston bombing like the other
[44:24.640 --> 44:31.040]  cases and it may be a real terror attack like like a major Hamed you know out at
[44:31.040 --> 44:35.880]  Fort Hood notice how that guy was protected for two years the CIA was
[44:35.880 --> 44:38.680]  watching him defense intelligence was watching him and they were ordered to
[44:38.680 --> 44:43.080]  let him do it and and that came out and got classified national security so so
[44:43.080 --> 44:47.200]  they've got all sorts of stuff where they could hit one button and basically
[44:47.200 --> 44:52.480]  covert special ops type teams private contractors Muslim sheep dipped extremists
[44:52.480 --> 44:57.280]  you name it they hit one button and they could just absolutely run a special
[44:57.280 --> 45:01.240]  forces operation of destabilization against us and the thing is and then
[45:01.240 --> 45:05.440]  have the police stand down under Homeland Security and let the establishment
[45:05.440 --> 45:09.520]  take hostages let the establishment put on these big events to then draw
[45:09.520 --> 45:13.440]  attention from everything else but the answer is what the Interpol chief said
[45:13.440 --> 45:17.120]  which is definitely a major move in a rebellion within the power structure so
[45:17.120 --> 45:21.080]  the only way to stop radical Islam or other groups hijacking and taking
[45:21.080 --> 45:25.840]  hostages is arm the people the guy's talking like George Washington yesterday
[45:25.840 --> 45:29.880]  that believe me they're gonna come after him but the point is we have to then
[45:29.880 --> 45:35.440]  stand with him okay when they that's what it's about your stuff gets worse and
[45:35.440 --> 45:39.400]  worse you're gonna see the people you thought were good are gonna turn bad
[45:39.400 --> 45:43.320]  folks you thought were bad you're gonna learn we're good people that you thought
[45:43.320 --> 45:46.920]  were okay are gonna really get even better or worse and we're gonna see who
[45:46.920 --> 45:51.560]  people are okay right now we're gonna really see where people stand where
[45:51.560 --> 45:55.320]  they are where they're going what they do because this is a historical period
[45:55.320 --> 45:59.280]  happening right now it might be a financial collapse they don't care of
[45:59.280 --> 46:03.280]  Obama gets the blame for it he's their ringer he's their closer he's their
[46:03.280 --> 46:06.680]  closing pitcher just like they've had closers in other countries don't bring
[46:06.680 --> 46:10.920]  a new puppet in so we need to explain it's not just Obama it's these big banks
[46:10.920 --> 46:15.320]  financing to get our guns God bless you brother good to hear from you and I'm
[46:15.320 --> 46:20.360]  fired up today I don't know what's going on hmm let's talk to Cyrus in
[46:20.360 --> 46:25.040]  California you're on the air thanks for calling hey Alex how you doing man I
[46:25.040 --> 46:29.200]  just want to say uh I you know I always thought it was some kind of BS you were
[46:29.200 --> 46:33.680]  trying to sell this iodine you know and my wife was you know why don't you just
[46:33.680 --> 46:37.840]  try it you know because I was blabbering to her about it but that about Alex is
[46:37.840 --> 46:41.080]  always talking about this okay we'll take a listening to it man it changed my
[46:41.080 --> 46:46.920]  life I ate every word I said because it changed my life bro well listen I want
[46:46.920 --> 46:49.840]  to be clear I want to be clear it can detox you and make you feel really bad
[46:49.840 --> 46:52.920]  we've had medical doctors and others on about it you should go check with your
[46:52.920 --> 46:58.320]  medical doctor listen this is certified at the National Academy of Sciences all
[46:58.320 --> 47:02.240]  this stuff I had it checked this is the only type of nasa and iodine like this
[47:02.240 --> 47:06.040]  out there with a special patented deal with Russian scientists I don't even
[47:06.040 --> 47:08.600]  know but when I looked into all this doctor groups dads like one of the most
[47:08.600 --> 47:14.960]  famous chemist group himself is like it is amazing and this is just one of the
[47:14.960 --> 47:18.080]  key things people need so if I'm gonna come out with something and put my name
[47:18.080 --> 47:21.920]  on it's gonna be the best the problem is is that they are manufacturing a bunch
[47:21.920 --> 47:25.760]  of it in the laboratory with all this special equipment and they never
[47:25.760 --> 47:29.480]  imagined that we would sell out of it this quick so and I didn't tell you to
[47:29.480 --> 47:32.880]  call in folks will think that we didn't you know screen your call it's wide open
[47:32.880 --> 47:37.560]  phones but yes if you folks can pre-order it it should be out in the next two to
[47:37.560 --> 47:39.960]  three weeks we can ship it out to you other folks already ordered you're
[47:39.960 --> 47:43.200]  getting it right now already got it survival shield nasa and iodine it's
[47:43.200 --> 47:47.480]  very very special but then there's other stuff like if you can't even afford
[47:47.480 --> 47:51.760]  this the next best thing is Himalayan salts and which you can buy for $5 at
[47:51.760 --> 47:56.160]  the store I mean I also say get that I'm not selling Himalayan salts don't have
[47:56.160 --> 48:01.680]  stock in it so you know there you go tell folks what it did to you well you
[48:01.680 --> 48:05.760]  know I was doing real lethargic I've always been a big guy you know I lost a
[48:05.760 --> 48:09.720]  bunch of weight when I was 29 30 years old and you know I was feeling better
[48:09.720 --> 48:14.280]  but I haven't gained much the weight back but I was feeling real lethargic you
[48:14.280 --> 48:18.000]  know I couldn't get out there I had to you know it was basic stuff like I've
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.320]  always worked with my hands and I had to go outside and take some fence post you
[48:22.320 --> 48:27.040]  know and and I was feeling really tired of just digging a few holes you know just
[48:27.040 --> 48:30.760]  getting real tired you know I went to the doctor and tell you you know they
[48:30.760 --> 48:33.360]  couldn't tell me anything that was wrong you know they tell you didn't know
[48:33.360 --> 48:37.040]  it did all my blood work they did you know they check all my levels I was like
[48:37.040 --> 48:42.280]  they according to them I was I was fine but for me I wasn't feeling so great so
[48:42.280 --> 48:46.080]  I was looking for something you know I exercise every day I try to eat real
[48:46.080 --> 48:49.040]  right so what happened when you took it because here's the deal I would even I
[48:49.040 --> 48:51.200]  might have been plugging this because I don't want it to have too many back
[48:51.200 --> 48:56.040]  orders I mean it's it's a victim of our own success the issue is we have all
[48:56.040 --> 48:59.520]  the government documents I showed them yesterday the studies they knew over a
[48:59.520 --> 49:04.040]  hundred years ago about iodine they knew it was key the government back when
[49:04.040 --> 49:08.760]  they weren't pure evil put iodine the you know the cruddy chemical type was
[49:08.760 --> 49:12.840]  it was what they had but it's better than nothing in the salt and then by the
[49:12.840 --> 49:16.880]  30s and 40s they took it out and then started putting you know fluoride in the
[49:16.880 --> 49:20.080]  water because it's on the periodic table is what
[49:20.080 --> 49:24.560]  zombifies you I mean I have medical studies from a hundred years ago that
[49:24.560 --> 49:28.400]  used the term zombification that was the term they use look at the public they
[49:28.400 --> 49:33.040]  are zombies I mean on the periodic table the bromine the bromide the fluoride
[49:33.040 --> 49:37.280]  the chlorine that's what you get in your glands and of course people can't
[49:37.280 --> 49:41.400]  Americans used to be the most vicious smartest most aggressive people were so
[49:41.400 --> 49:44.480]  polite because if you mess with somebody they would kill you men were
[49:44.480 --> 49:47.640]  constantly on the street stabbing and shooting each other so everybody was so
[49:47.640 --> 49:51.120]  polite because we were just crazed we were like the meanest toughest people
[49:51.120 --> 49:54.960]  from the whole world that came here swashbucklers and now we're the fattest
[49:54.960 --> 50:00.520]  dumbest laziest lowest IQ the highest cancer rates their chemical warfaring us
[50:00.520 --> 50:06.320]  it's survival shield but you can't get it so get him away in salts why do you
[50:06.320 --> 50:09.600]  think they tell you don't have a fat diet I think they tell you don't get salt
[50:09.600 --> 50:14.240]  the good salt because they want they want you bowing down to them I know I'm so
[50:14.240 --> 50:22.360]  crazed it doesn't matter they could shut me down doesn't matter the secrets
[50:22.360 --> 50:27.000]  already out other people gonna put it out that's actually part of my plan to I
[50:27.000 --> 50:30.960]  hope bunch of competition figures it out comes out with it I don't care I want to
[50:30.960 --> 50:38.640]  empower humanity how long you've been on the iodine a month or so and so well

[50:43.840 --> 50:47.560]  reason they spray it on almost all the processed foods not just as a pesticide

[50:52.680 --> 50:56.160]  million will turn you into a vegetable I mean they're just murdering us and

[55:12.920 --> 55:18.400]  way folks if you go up to info wars.com we were linked to the federal website
[55:18.400 --> 55:24.120]  where the government on purpose or accidentally posted the information
[55:24.120 --> 55:29.160]  that we showed earlier dealing with the TSA admitting that it's not for
[55:29.160 --> 55:33.200]  terrorism what they do but for slave training they have now pulled that off
[55:33.200 --> 55:36.680]  the federal website and I just instructed my guys I don't want that on my
[55:36.680 --> 55:40.480]  server you can find out where it is somewhere else like one of the big
[55:40.480 --> 55:44.840]  scrib or whatever and a link to it there but where's the mainstream media you
[55:44.840 --> 55:49.040]  would think this has been out since last Thursday you would think the government
[55:49.040 --> 55:52.840]  trying to gag a blogger I guess next it'll be us from talking about this
[55:52.840 --> 55:58.160]  stuff that they put out this war on the press this war on whistleblowers you
[55:58.160 --> 56:03.320]  would think that that would be national news but no they just take it down and
[56:03.320 --> 56:07.440]  ignore info wars.com and it doesn't matter let's just go on with the fraud of
[56:07.440 --> 56:15.600]  the TSA takeover with the TSA coming out yesterday the TSA coming out and
[56:15.600 --> 56:19.560]  saying oh we track you at your job outside your house with the threat
[56:19.560 --> 56:23.000]  fusion centers of course it's the link up with the health care with the
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.440]  government training camps the public schools the colleges the businesses with
[56:26.440 --> 56:30.640]  infregard everyone spying on everybody except the criminals that run the whole
[56:30.640 --> 56:35.840]  system they're under national security and how dare you even ask a question of
[56:35.840 --> 56:40.800]  the TSA we will arrest you how dare the media pull up the front gates of the
[56:40.800 --> 56:45.560]  NSA and ask to talk to their public information give me your cameras you
[56:45.560 --> 56:50.440]  don't aim a camera at us why we have privacy I mean we're the government how
[56:50.440 --> 56:55.840]  dare you. Since the TSA doesn't like it and their
[56:55.840 --> 56:58.800]  whole takeover of the economy let's let's have a Don's article repost of the
[56:58.800 --> 57:04.240]  front page since he's coming up from last Thursday all right let's go ahead and
[57:04.240 --> 57:08.320]  go to another caller Corey in Minnesota you're on the air active duty
[57:08.320 --> 57:13.440]  National Guard have you been told by your NCOs get ready to take those guns
[57:13.440 --> 57:18.200]  and put a bullet in mommy for Obama you know you know what that was a reason I
[57:18.200 --> 57:21.920]  was trying to call in yesterday Alex is that we we did actually a beta test and
[57:21.920 --> 57:25.280]  for all the military and police that are standing here probably listening to the
[57:25.280 --> 57:30.440]  lines right now we actually implemented a little system here I'm not actually from
[57:30.440 --> 57:34.640]  Minnesota I just didn't want to do the state because of you know let's just say
[57:34.640 --> 57:38.920]  you're from the former United States of America in a FEMA region there you go
[57:38.920 --> 57:43.680]  I'm up in the Northeast FEMA region then here's the issue Alex we did a beta
[57:43.680 --> 57:47.600]  test after you had that master sergeant I'm not the active duty one down in I
[57:47.600 --> 57:51.400]  believe was Texas with the firearms issue and it really touched my heart
[57:51.400 --> 57:55.000]  especially when you put that article up today and then maybe feel stating that
[57:55.000 --> 58:00.760]  CJ Gresham yeah yeah yes yeah we did a beta test here up in the Northeast
[58:00.760 --> 58:05.160]  region and now we went out to all the units and in all the armories and you
[58:05.160 --> 58:09.080]  guys can all do this too and your police headquarters at your army base
[58:09.080 --> 58:13.480]  wherever you're at every person knows that there's a safety board and a
[58:13.480 --> 58:16.840]  bulletin board that has no randoms for me they're your commander and or your
[58:16.840 --> 58:20.720]  police chief so what we did was we went out and we copied the entire Billarites
[58:20.720 --> 58:24.720]  Constitution and here's the beta test for everybody to really see who is on
[58:24.720 --> 58:29.240]  board with this and who is not we posted it up to the safety board up to the
[58:29.240 --> 58:32.880]  bulletin board and up to the main board on all the command headquarters and we
[58:32.880 --> 58:36.560]  put the Billarites the NDA. Hold on stay there I want to hear what happened we
[58:36.560 --> 58:41.080]  came back don't hang up. Shack an hour coming up.

[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:12.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:30.400]  Alex Jones well we're gonna be breaking down the biblical level gang rape that's
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.640]  what I call it it's what it is by the global mafia of the American people and
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:37.320]  they're just getting started squeezing us until we wake up stop caring what
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:41.800]  Hollywood says and become humans again till we pop the matrix bubble but we were
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:46.920]  just talking to Corey who's active duty National Guard in the Northeast so I
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:51.000]  guess he's in female region one or two of the former United States and he
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.080]  recap everything you just said this is very noteworthy so start over sir go
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:01.720]  ahead what we did was we we beta tested to basically give an idea not only
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.360]  people at work because obviously some of us are talking about this constantly we
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:09.200]  aware of the data and all the situations are rising not only within the
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:15.120]  states here in the Northeast but we start noticing mission changes to where
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:20.040]  a memorandum came out to where DHS is now in basic complete control of the
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:25.840]  National Guard and an escalation of force slash an emergency so we have guys
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.360]  that were starting to question this so we decided to beta test on all the safety
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.680]  bulletin boards and a few of the police departments have been doing it here
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:36.800]  because we want to figure out who's on board with this and who's not so we put
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.120]  up the not only the Bill of Rights Constitution up on all the safety
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:45.400]  bulletin boards but also the main commanding bulletin boards around the units to see who
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.800]  is going to take them down who is going to give us basically some ruckus and
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.960]  mind you I am an NCO I love my job love the people I have my daughter my family
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:02:00.720]  and now we basically we were seeing the routing out of who is actually pulling
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:06.560]  this stuff down and forgive me for a second sounds like you're pretty freaked
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:10.400]  out now it's it's scary to know we've been infiltrated by actual foreign bank
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.080]  operatives I mean this this is this is legend what's happening to this country
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.360]  mean this is the takedown of America what are you seeing happening when you
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.480]  post the Bill of Rights and Constitution the commanders are at their
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:26.520]  discretion because of the the tags and specifically the basically as in general
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:32.560]  they're taking him off and now we're basically trying to fight back through
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:39.280]  jag forgive me for a moment it's so evil I know I would cry too I've cried many
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:47.320]  times no it's just now again you sworn an oath to this and then with Alex and
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.640]  you can put a thing up about a oh wow you can put up a thing about a softball
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:56.000]  game that's fine but you don't put up the Bill of Rights but please continue
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.880]  sir so what we do is we started figuring out hey who's who's making this come
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:06.160]  down here and Jack said it was completely completely constitutional you do
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:10.880]  that and you know some of them are on point with this and not it all came
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.920]  down to like I said it through the permission changes and that I'll even
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.720]  publicly stated on air you can all go to your governors and your National Guard
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:21.800]  and to your tag in your state which is the adjunct in general for your National
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:26.680]  Guard and you can ask them why they gave authority to the Department of
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.360]  Homeland Security over the National Guard and why the mission is now
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:37.320]  changing to gang insurrections Alex why would they be doing that now if there's
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.200]  not a timeline in sequence for the next six months and you know damn long what
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:45.600]  it is but why is it now turning to not only the gang insurrections that they're
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.920]  focusing on permission now you're understanding why these commanders are
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:54.480]  starting to get the memos including the upper echelon of us NCOs of why you
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:59.600]  would fire on Americans and I hope people realize this is deadly serious they
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:04.560]  could nuke a city please do an article on this because it can shit out of us
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:08.320]  up there well you better everybody better be concerned that's what I'm
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:12.440]  telling people they are training to literally put us in FEMA camps I mean
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:17.040]  folks have to understand this the most evil people you can imagine are in
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:22.160]  control Homeland Security has always been to destroy the country it is the
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:27.800]  guillotine it is use the thing analogy it's the thing that absorbs America and
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:32.600]  then acts like it okay and and and so yes we'll do an article on it we need

[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.960]  have stuff you don't want out we need people to document this and we need
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:43.080]  people to start going public it's the only way we're gonna blow this
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:47.400]  operation wide open is that you're gonna have to start going public and you're

[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:32.720]  said that the officers he knows NCOs are called in and told your new mission is
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.640]  fighting the american people shooting them during gun confiscation now we have
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:43.760]  Forbes Reuters AP all off documents we got that are public that the army is
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:49.400]  preparing civilian inmate labor camps that's that's declassified slave labor
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:55.040]  camps I mean I'm giving the media the terms civilian inmate labor camps the
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:10:01.520]  national emergency centers act that just increases funding for what's already
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.240]  there I'm not trying to scare you okay we had a non-commissioned officer on
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:09.680]  named Corey and we're going to our guest who started crying earlier how many
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:13.280]  honest with you folks I've cried here on air I can't help it I start getting so
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:18.040]  sad for America and so freaked out how far we've fallen that I will start
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:21.600]  crying involuntarily it's like getting a call and saying your grandfather just
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:26.920]  died I mean it it's not even scary it's horrible I start conjuring up those
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:32.280]  feelings and I get chills I mean it's so real I know I'm right I've got hundreds
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.640]  of documents and yuppies pointed me on the street and laugh and go there's the
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:42.160]  guy warning and I'm like I care about these people they want to break America
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:45.320]  they want to bring in a disarmament rule government there's only six or seven
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:51.160]  countries reconown guns in the world folks the US
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:58.720]  Switzerland and I get so freaked out
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.600]  knowing that that I mean I went to the urban warfare drills before we had the
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:06.680]  documents 15 16 years ago where they were trying to take our guns and they
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.440]  grew it under Clinton and now under Obama they're rolling it out and they're
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.680]  going operational with TV and movies and dramas and sitcoms where the gun owners
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.840]  are being arrested where the gun owners are the bad guys where you arrest the
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:20.520]  tea party people and then top generals come out and say no we are preparing to
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.360]  fight them they are the threat not Al Qaeda and the head of Homeland Security
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:29.520]  says it it's public and now the military down to the privates are getting the
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:33.240]  riot training the gun confiscation training it's now gone past the non
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.200]  commissioned officers and now they're freaking out going this is really real
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:42.360]  Alex didn't lie to us and they're breaking down he started crying earlier
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:47.440]  not out of fear I know why it's really freaky to know that the officers above
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:51.000]  them are globalist operatives and if they put up the Bill of Rights
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.040]  Constitution and their oath on the wall it's all pulled down folks including the
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:59.040]  oath I have state police on video pull over woman who is a pocket
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:03.280]  Constitution and arrest her for it and they get scared by the Constitution
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:07.440]  because they're not even bad people they're brainwashed and they think well
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.680]  if the Constitution is bad even though they swore an oath it must be a bad
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:14.200]  person instead of admitting they were wrong and that the people telling them
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:18.680]  this are obviously evil they go okay it's bad and they buy into it that's
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:23.440]  how tyranny works a lot of Hitler's top people really worked 18 hours a day and
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:27.880]  believe they were good and believe they were doing a holy mission same thing
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:32.240]  with the Communist because they by successive approximation they cannot
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:36.160]  admit their mission is wrong so they buy into anything we're gonna go to our
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:42.760]  guest but I wanted to let Corey calling from FEMA region one who's a non
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:47.560]  commissioned officer they did a test at bases all over they put up on the
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:50.520]  bulletin board where you can put up softball games whatever the Bill of Rights
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:54.760]  Constitution then their oath and they've talked to Jag above it and say no you
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:59.920]  should do that and so now it's causing a debate and they're identifying and you
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:03.760]  sound pretty freaked out sir two more minutes we're going to our guests who I
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:07.880]  appreciate holding tell us sir who himself has been threatened basically
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:12.040]  with arrest by Homeland Security for free speech and this is bombshell we're
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.960]  about to cover and this is happening they're already persecuting the Tea
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:19.240]  Party with the IRS folks if you knuckle under in fear if they win they take it
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:22.800]  all you're gonna have to man up folks sir any other points you want to make
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:28.240]  why did you start breaking down let me guess did they take down the Bill of
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:34.520]  Rights Constitution at most of the basis one of the things about it Alex
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:38.720]  definitely it's not any worse and one of the big things that I that I brought
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:43.960]  up that's been bothering me ever since Iraq in 07 it's a it's ever since I've
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:49.040]  been in the military almost nine years now not a single commander not both
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.760]  Massachusetts Rhode Island or Connecticut has come out in front of
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:55.960]  their troops including the first sergeants which I thought the MCO Corps was
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:59.640]  the backbone of the army but these guys are so focused on the careers that they
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:03.800]  won't have their commanders come out and read the Constitution give a kind of
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:07.360]  events to their soldiers to see why we're going to Afghanistan and Iraq still
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:11.320]  bowering but now and of course in the past for those that don't know even 15
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:15.360]  years ago that was always red and they always told you there could be a day
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.360]  when bad people take over the government because it always happens like
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:22.560]  third-world nations but instead but I mean let me specifically what are the
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:28.160]  numbers how many places did they pull down the Constitution this it's got to
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:32.520]  be at least seven armories right now and that's why we brought I talked to Jack
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:37.120]  about it because this is its garbage because even aviation war officers and
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:41.760]  stuff like that are getting in on this I know you know about the the A10s the
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:47.400]  left what was it Connecticut I believe back in 2002 went up to Massachusetts
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.520]  they had a whole aviation wing that was up against even for 9-11 because of a
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:55.840]  stuff that was coming down I mean it's it goes back that far but you're really
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.600]  really seeing the insurrection here amongst these three states here up in
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.800]  the Northeast region then I we we have a question for the tag because we want to
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:09.280]  know are you are you are you familiar troops the commanders for the troops
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.640]  obviously our numbers aren't that that big up here but it's it's a serious
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:17.400]  serious question and when you start pulling stuff down when we want to get
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:22.440]  the word out about this don't make it secret about how DHS is trying to hold
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:27.120]  back the memorandums for meetings upon meetings just to give this word that
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:30.600]  DHS is going to have control of the National Guard during an emergency
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:35.760]  preparedness slash exercise or that here the writings on the wall Alex and
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.240]  that that's what really really got well let's be clear let's be clear with the
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:43.520]  public this isn't rumors we had the Navy seal on yesterday who said no the
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.640]  non-commissioned officers are being told prepare for war against America we're
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:52.840]  gonna confiscate the guns that's up on info wars.com and you know you can go
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.760]  out and it's in the mainstream news that they're saying the founding fathers are
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:00.840]  bad the Tea Party is the enemy not Al Qaeda and our government's arming Al
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:05.680]  Qaeda in Syria while training to take us on God bless you and look don't let them
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:10.200]  ever say you're not following orders or you're bad these people aren't just
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:15.440]  misguided these are enemy agents just like a Soviet infiltration but it's a
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:19.760]  corporate infiltration so that makes it okay no it's not this is the takeover
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:24.840]  and this is the key time right now God bless you the military's 80% awake now
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:29.800]  though I mean they really jumped the shark on this one they really did folks
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.320]  because they're telling them those non-commissioned officers you ready to
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:37.560]  kill people in America ready to take the guns and they're like what what all this
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:41.760]  stuff is true and then the military's going in researching and finding all the
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:46.680]  public stuff you're blown your operations blown now I want to shift gears to the
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:51.840]  TSA let's put the article on screen this man needs our support internal TSA
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:56.200]  documents body scanners pat downs not for terrorist and then the update article
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:01.280]  this gentleman we have on this is a public document they put out they've
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:08.040]  now removed it off the federal website saying that they admit that the TSA is
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.760]  not for terrorists but it's just basically for currency controls and
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:16.880]  internal checkpoints and then now they've come out and censored him that's
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:22.160]  the article they've come out and told John Corbett that they're gonna arrest
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:27.320]  him or gag order him or whatever if if he talks about TSA out of our pants dot
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:32.040]  wordpress.com if he talks about a document somebody released that they
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:36.240]  weren't supposed to release unprecedented censorship of the press sir
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:41.360]  you're on the air thank you for coming on with us I give us your take on this
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:46.400]  John Corbett well it's it's quite interesting so you guys published that
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:51.440]  doc and the next day I got a call from from the court and from the opposing
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:55.000]  council the US Attorney's Office basically telling me that I'm the only
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.080]  person in the world that's not allowed to talk about this document because even
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:03.440]  though it's public it's technically sealed which is an interesting take on
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:07.720]  it that's right I mean this is this is the war on the press or the war on the
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:12.680]  citizen free speech unprecedented tell us who called called you a you warned or
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.240]  you said don't you know about the Streisand effect tell folks about that
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:21.160]  correct so so after I got the call to stop talking I asked the US dream but
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:25.120]  I said this is public this is on on info wars it's got millions of people
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:29.760]  looking at it already if I stop talking about it and I censor myself and I take
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.600]  it down it's just gonna have more people looking at it but the US Attorney
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:39.640]  didn't seem to understand perhaps how mass media works how internet works and
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:44.960]  and it's it's kind of backfire on them but has already backfired
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:52.120]  continue breaking this down sure so well it all started when when I filed a
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:57.720]  brief in my case against the the TSA nude body scanners and their pat downs the
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:02.440]  brief is based on a bunch of private documents that the TSA had to provide me
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:06.640]  as a result of my case the court ordered me not to share them and then I
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:10.880]  followed the court's orders to the letter by filing a sealed brief which the
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:15.680]  court then promptly published publicly by accident it was it was a an interesting
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:19.560]  scandal up there at the 11th circuit now they're they're backpedaling they're
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:23.040]  trying to cover this up they're trying to take the documents down but the
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:26.960]  documents are quite embarrassing I still can't talk about what's in them but
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:30.720]  but your your listeners and viewers can definitely go to your website to find
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:35.280]  documents that's right we're linked to scribe on there on the website we're
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:39.040]  gonna come back and I know in America you're not allowed to talk just because
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:42.960]  they called you in their God and usually you'd say well you got free speech you
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:46.600]  can talk about something they put out publicly but in the new system where they
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:50.040]  have armored vehicles and killer standing by at this point till we take
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:55.600]  America back you cannot talk about the document that they released on accident
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:01.880]  because well they have guns and they have armored vehicles Alex Jones here

[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:23.960]  blow the bomb well we have John Corbett thought criminal in the year 2013 in a
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:28.000]  federal court case the TSA admitted in testimony the documents are linked up on
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:34.920]  info wars dot com they've taken it off pacer dot gov both are redacted and the
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:38.520]  unredacted one so the one they accidentally put out and the one that by
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:43.600]  law is supposed to be out they've pulled that because the TSA is admitting it's
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:47.040]  all a total fraud the body scanners everything and our guest has been
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.040]  threatened with arrest if he talks about the document because I guess they see
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:58.680]  him at TSA out of our pants as their number one enemy John Corbett I mean I
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:04.040]  why are you following this verbal threat by the commissar and who is the
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:07.080]  commissar or can you even tell us her name I mean her name is in the article
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:13.080]  sure so the the opposing attorney is is with the Department of Justice her name
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:19.320]  is Sharon Swingle she works on many TSA cases and I'm following it because I'm
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:23.680]  essentially being indirectly threatened with a criminal contempt of court
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:28.200]  charge potentially a felony that could send me to jail so in the meantime to
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:33.040]  clear clear things up I've asked the court to clarify whether or not I can
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:36.680]  now talk about this this document which is public and it's interesting that you
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:40.160]  actually brought up that the other the the redacted version the one that's
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:45.640]  supposed to be public has been taken down as well and I think the reason for
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:51.040]  that is that the TSA demanded that they get a chance to review that document
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:55.440]  before it goes public which is some kind of of right they've taken unto
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:59.720]  themselves the idea that opposing counsel can demand to review a document
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:06.480]  well sure sure what do you make of your little friends now announcing was in
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:09.840]  the Associated Press yesterday that they're spying on where you work what
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:14.880]  you buy what you do in essay spying just mainline now the TSA are on the
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:20.160]  streets and are watching everybody they are the secret police yeah it's it's
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:23.400]  something that we we should have seen coming in you know you and I did see
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:28.080]  coming I'm sure Alex but the TSA started the secure flight program whereby
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:33.160]  they they take everyone's name and try and do things against a background check
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:37.320]  and I don't know if everyone that's listening knows but the TSA gets all
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:42.040]  that information from the airlines well in advance so when you book a ticket that
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:46.640]  information gets to the TSA well before days before you ever get to the airlines
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:52.400]  get the Google stuff what you surf what you do where you work so basically you
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:56.880]  know what size diaphragm you use the TSA person doesn't just get a photo of
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:01.640]  your breasts and your your your body or your tallywacker they get they get
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:06.320]  everything they even know what brand of medicine you buy which I think they
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:12.040]  should know I think they should rule everything all of North Korea yeah you're
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:15.560]  right so they they started by getting all this information from the airline but
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:18.800]  think they're getting from the airline your name your your date of birth your
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:22.600]  address your phone number your email address all that good stuff and imagine
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:26.160]  where they can go from there from there they can access all their their
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:32.400]  government databases all the FBI background checks NCIS they can go to
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:37.720]  non-public or to private databases such as Equifax go to your credit report and
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:42.320]  it's come out that they're doing this and the question has to be why what what
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:46.400]  have they done that has shown that any any of that will actually reduce the
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:50.840]  risk of terrorism by the way there there is pretty not a limited evidence of
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:55.480]  risk of terrorism so what terrorism are we trying to reduce and will this
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:58.800]  actually reduce it is the question well let's get down to brass tax this is an
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:03.120]  internal security force for capital controls I saw a meeting in 2002 with
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:08.520]  TSA before DHS was even cabinet level with a roundtable group on C-SPAN with
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:13.320]  hundreds of members of corporations there represented and they said to get a
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:17.400]  job you'll go through TSA they'll have highway checkpoints everything and I've
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:20.240]  been talking about it ever since it's not like I just guessed all this was
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:24.840]  coming this is a total takeover plan Ron Paul's right the border fence is to keep
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:30.560]  us in it's just a total takeover you're right I mean you're right about the
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:34.920]  cash control there's there's even evidence that the TSA reports basically
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:38.320]  two things to law enforcement number one is when someone brings a small amount of
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:41.680]  drugs to the checkpoint that they've forgotten their pocket and number two is
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:44.800]  if you try and bring more than about five thousand dollars worth of currency
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:49.080]  they'll report that to customs and border patrol and they download your
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:54.440]  computers without warrants and your iPhones and everything else and again
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:29:02.120]  squeeze your your junk so it's it's a free country yeah it used to be well you
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:05.360]  know they're talking about arresting people that talk about about the dear
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:09.160]  leader so and of course they're threatening to arrest you in fact and
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:13.360]  are you allowed to talk about the threats you got her yeah I can talk about
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:18.200]  pretty much anything but the contents of that of that sealed brief so so so what
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:23.240]  does she threaten you with lovingly you know the threats are vague but implied
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:27.720]  you know they they tell you that essentially bad things will happen if
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:32.760]  you if you end up doing this the same way the Chicago mob would be like you
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:37.000]  need to do what you're told or bad things will happen yeah exactly your kid

[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:04.120]  everybody and I'm gonna air a special report from last night with Jakari
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:10.280]  Jackson coming up for part of the next segment dealing with one of the most
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:15.880]  important issues out there and that is a well-known highly decorated Navy SEAL
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:19.280]  going public and saying the non-commissioned officers are now being
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:25.480]  asked by the higher-ups will you fire on Americans during gun confiscation now
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:30.720]  this is actually in official documents the big news is that it's now being
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:40.480]  discovered by the low-level folks it's being discovered by the people below
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:50.080]  even sergeant and so that's why there's a big alarm and here's the big issue if
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:56.360]  they have gotten to the point where they're actually getting down to to
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:35:03.600]  privates below corporals you better know they're getting ready to go
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:07.320]  operational now that does not mean they're going to do it if we do everything
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:10.520]  we can to get the word out about this educate the military and the police just
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:14.480]  like under Clinton they'll back off but now this is I'm not gonna exaggerate this
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:18.120]  is like 10 times worse than Clinton I mean back then it's like man they're
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:21.480]  really gonna try this now the public isn't ready even with a big stage to
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:24.840]  vent now they've got Homeland Security in place look at all the other stuff
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:30.440]  they're doing the open persecution of the press you better be scared of not
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:35.040]  speaking out and going public you better be heard now and I salute Matt drudge
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:39.680]  at drudgereport.com exposing things like this and you know covering the army
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:43.520]  manual from judicial watch when they say George Washington the founding fathers
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:47.040]  are bad and the Tea Party's bad and they're our main enemy our military
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:50.080]  doesn't train to fight the Russians they don't train to fight Al Qaeda they
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:54.160]  trained for us I mean this is what happens all third-world countries this
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:59.200]  happened in Rome 2060 something years ago with Julius Caesar this is what
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:06.920]  happens I mean this is the plague of free countries for 236 years old no
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:11.000]  nation has ever lasted that long we're the equivalent like 98 years old and we
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.880]  just went in for a CAT scan we got bone cancer brain cancer liver cancer
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:19.240]  pancreatic cancer I mean we got cancers twice the size of our body we're
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:23.200]  dragging around I mean America was so strong we're still operating I mean it
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:27.640]  is the establishment might as well be swinging from chandeliers raping our
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:33.160]  daughters I mean it is it is with that just just just like robbing the bank
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:38.360]  laughing at us you know Obamacare is a total fraud openly bad-mouthing the
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:42.280]  founding fathers and they got a bunch of cops and military that have been picked
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:47.120]  out of all the good men and women and they finally have built a command force
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:53.240]  filled with traitors and filled with scum the San Antonio police chief would
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:58.240]  not say he wouldn't confiscate guns in mass in order to do so by Obama I know
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:01.720]  his predecessor Ali Philippus would have said absolutely not like I'm on tape
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:06.480]  saying on ever confiscate guns then that's treason I know the former police
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:10.040]  chief down there formerly army intelligence a patriot both the
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:14.200]  whistle on Delta Force bribes the new police chief in San Antonio looked me
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:20.000]  right in the eyes McManus and said I mean he had he had a aid to camp with
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:25.520]  him a sergeant I mean who was just I could tell would once power so you guys
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:28.640]  are gonna get power for a short season but you're gonna be known as the
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:35.800]  traitors you're idiots idiots and cowards didn't want to throw up excuse
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:41.280]  me now by the way we just broke the TSA news that nobody else will cover they
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:44.080]  admit the whole things are fraud and about to take over and the feds have
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:47.600]  pulled that off their doc I mean we just break bombshell after bombshell not
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:51.760]  because we're special everybody else cowards in fear Michael Savage didn't
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:55.120]  cower in fear he's had good shiardi who's a correspondent with us as well now I
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:59.360]  guess you're doing some correspondent work with him with the story leak.com and
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:02.000]  I'm glad there's people like Anthony good shiardi out there and others because we
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.320]  need more people folks I don't want to be the only guy out there fighting I want
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:11.360]  to win the war against the globalist that's my goal and Anthony good shiardi
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:15.800]  here with some updates on several issues it's in the Associated Press nuclear
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:21.240]  officers napped with blast doors left open Air Force officers entrusted with
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:25.480]  the launch keys to long-range nuclear missiles have been caught twice this year
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:28.720]  leaving open the blast door those intended to help prevent a terrorist or
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:31.920]  other intruder from entering their underground command post Air Force
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:35.200]  officials said this is all part of the purge who knows if this is true they've
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:38.840]  purged two top generals the number one the number two admiral over all the
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:42.840]  nuclear weapons and and didn't want the media covering it AP said had to be
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:46.080]  leaked to them weeks later turns out happened right after we broke the
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:50.520]  missing nukes so there's all sorts of crazy stuff going on an update on this
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:53.160]  briefly just for a few minutes Anthony and then there's another reason I got
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:57.000]  you in here but what is your take to some all the general insanity going on
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.240]  and and the military openly training to take on the American people in high
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:05.720]  treason exactly so what's interesting is the real news we actually broke this
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:09.840]  entire nuke catastrophe here and the AP has been reporting on this and alluding
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:14.000]  to our reports on this without actually saying it so they've been brilliant
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.840]  that's because they're gagged they're not even allowed to ask Obama why
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.880]  healthcare doesn't work right that's the one inch least they're on but notice
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:23.760]  that they're actually trying to tell the truth in some ways it appears they're
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:26.840]  talking about how they you know the new commanders it was leaked they were fired
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:30.120]  on the same day as the transfer we reported on yeah because everybody
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:33.160]  loves their kids if they're not completely insane and yeah exactly and
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:36.840]  they're asking in this article what's going on all these commanders are getting
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:39.760]  fired all this information they're they're very vague about all this
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:43.440]  information about nuclear stuff they're saying what is happening here and
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:46.720]  they're mentioning us without actually mentioning us by name or the story of
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:50.320]  the Dias Air Force Nuke Transfer and Lindsey Graham coming out and saying
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:53.840]  there could be a strike on South Carolina where the nukes were going hours
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:57.120]  after we released the report that they were secretly transferring the nukes to
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:01.320]  South Carolina as many of you are aware but what's really key here is they're
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:05.200]  showing that not only is there a nuke transfer going on not only are all the
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:09.200]  top commanders being fired but whether it's negligence or on purpose the
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:14.200]  blast doors to actually access these nukes and launch them anywhere are
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:19.160]  being completely left and see they're now leaving stories of why a nuke may get
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:23.560]  lost or how the Patriots are Al Qaeda whoever they blame it on the script is
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:27.960]  we're working with Al Qaeda now yeah even before it was on MSNBC made up now
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:32.200]  the the West Point training is the Tea Party is gonna link up with Al Qaeda I
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:39.440]  mean the most Islamophobic beyond compare Tea Party is gonna join Al Qaeda
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:43.680]  that's like saying Superman's gonna join Lex Luthor I mean this is just or or I
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:48.080]  mean it is it is total fraud but that's their script and I'm telling you these
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:52.920]  stories are being planted so that when stuff happens that's what I think they
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:58.280]  can sit there and say oh actually that's how because that was the word these
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:04.240]  were warheads for missiles ICBMs that's what our people didn't know exactly
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:06.800]  they said these aren't supposed to be here but they look like not bombs these
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:12.080]  were warheads and warheads that go in Merv packages multiple reentry device
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:17.160]  packages probably saying too much the point now Merv's the Merv missiles are
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:20.520]  open I mean this is all pure bull go ahead and even in the article it talks
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:24.280]  about the issues with ICBMs and how there's been a lot of catastrophe and
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:27.400]  weird stuff going on and AP is actually pushing this this is an AP
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:30.680]  exclusive but what you're saying ties into the news that I wrote about
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:35.120]  yesterday it's up on info wars the TSA expanding their search and this was one
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:38.040]  of the things that we covered and pushed into the media as well expanding their
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:41.120]  search it's not just about being a passenger anymore they're tracking you
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:44.600]  through private and government databases and that will be used as you were
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:48.640]  saying to if something happens say well look the TSA is here we're expanding
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:51.400]  this because we want to catch the terrorists outside of the airport now
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:55.960]  yeah Al Qaeda had the shoulder launch rockets in Dallas or or Houston or
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:59.720]  wherever and they took out the aircraft now we're gonna be within two miles roving
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:03.440]  checkpoints that's all the official plan yeah and they're gonna get your wife
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:06.680]  and get her over there in the TN and the state police are gonna proctology here
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:09.400]  and if you don't like them they're gonna blow your head off because they rule
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:13.440]  everything now well it's just like the NSA they claim that oh they actually
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:16.320]  stopped a bunch of terrorist threats and here's how this works they'll say
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:19.440]  that it'll be big news and then it was like a week ago they admitted they
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:23.560]  actually didn't stop any the government runs the terrorist or if they find a
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:27.560]  real one they they protect them they lavish them they give the money on record
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:32.520]  and then wind them up to attack us but I come later you know out of the out of
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:35.760]  the base so they can say anything they want it becomes a headline and that
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.760]  becomes a talking point and then when it really comes out and it's exposed and
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:41.280]  everything like that a week later no one cares that's the problem and the
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:45.200]  narrative is troops and police your heroes fighting Al Qaeda now watch
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:50.240]  these people that like freedom I mean it's just open try I can't believe we we
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:54.120]  actually have the most nasty form of governmental cancer I've ever seen we
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:57.320]  are and they're there and we're in a stalemate and they're and they're
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:01.200]  gutting everything they can the dollar our future our republic everybody's
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:04.880]  savings they're wrecking everything they can as fast as they can Anthony
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:09.000]  everything they've got control of foster kids mass drugging seizures killing
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:14.320]  them testing pesticides on them prisoners troops guinea pigs but things
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:18.120]  they don't have control of they want control of so they can strangle it who
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:22.520]  would have thought in 2013 that asking a peace officer a head peace officer if
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:27.000]  he would confiscate our guns if ordered by Obama we would get looks that we were
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.200]  crazy and some Fed next to us staring us down saying he's a private citizen you
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:34.360]  remember that guy yeah who had a badge on and had his hand on this guy yeah
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:38.520]  exactly like he was quick draw McGraw like like we're scared of him with a gun
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:42.520]  when we come out in public violating the ordinance with guns mounted on our backs
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:48.640]  yeah oh we're so afraid you might get me I didn't know that oh you think I'm like
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:53.520]  you you little freaking coward you think I'd sell my family out like you dirt bag
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:58.360]  you think I'm freaking stone like you you think I'm a coward like you I'm sorry
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:04.680]  I'm sorry go ahead go ahead it's just insane that we are the weird ones for
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:08.080]  asking such a fundamental question when they said yeah hypothetically I can't I
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:10.840]  can't answer that question well did you hypothetically take an oath to the
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:15.040]  Constitution to uphold it well well yes we did well is the second amendment in
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:19.480]  the Constitution well well yeah I guess so so would you confiscate guns if Obama
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:23.160]  Lord and Savior told you to do so oh I don't know I can't say exact quote that
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:26.400]  is actually exactly what we said they said why can't answer that question they
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:29.480]  wouldn't even say yes or no because all they care about is having a costume on
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:32.600]  and everyone being scared of them well it's that you know I love being on that
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:35.960]  crowd that the people weren't shaking at the police yeah they were actually they
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:38.960]  were holding their ground there was a lot of them there too and it was like most
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:42.320]  of police were actually on our side I'll be honest but it's the higher you go up
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:46.760]  they become these political creatures no I don't think he's a bad guy that's the
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:50.720]  weird thing I think the police chief was a decent guy they're just too scared
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:53.720]  even afraid to say he was afraid to say wouldn't confiscate it because he felt
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:56.760]  like his higher ups in the political chain we eat him alive that was a fed
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:02.280]  there bugging his eyes yeah and he said oh I'm a listener he was man maybe the
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:05.560]  guy isn't bad too I just know he was they were acting scared I don't like that he
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:09.760]  was just I mean I don't like being around men that are scared I'm sick of it I mean
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:14.080]  that's the the the fed shouldn't have been scared of us yeah maybe they were
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:17.120]  scared of something else I don't know well you know he was afraid that we were
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:20.280]  asking these questions to the police chief as if we weren't even allowed to
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:23.200]  go next to our peace officers and ask them anything it's just like when I
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:25.920]  asked why is there a guy in the window filming us I was just wondering what it
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:28.800]  was going on there they acted like I was a terrorist and they said we have
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:32.360]  intel something very bad is going to happen oh and sorry I didn't did it no
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:36.560]  nothing happened it was very as if one of their cowardly wind-up toys is going
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:41.400]  to go to an open carry fully loaded March yeah don't they get it we aren't
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:44.600]  afraid we're afraid of letting the tyrants take over that's all we're
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:48.160]  afraid of we're afraid of turning our families and our culture over to evil
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:53.320]  and and failing our ancestors don't they understand any of this I pose a
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:57.080]  question where would you rather be in the event of a quote-unquote mass
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:01.520]  shooting at an elementary school or to open carry March which would be safer
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:05.400]  gee at an elementary school it would be a bloodbath and no one would stop it
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:08.760]  until 45 minutes statistically later when the police show up or or even more
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:12.680]  than that but at an open carry rally it would take about one second for the
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:19.360]  shooter to go down and the open carry rally is essentially a overall basic
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:23.200]  minute example of the United States at large if we were armed and the
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:27.280]  elementary school is Chicago and that's why in Chicago more gun deaths than in
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:31.080]  Afghanistan what do you make of the inner polehead coming out and saying the
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:33.760]  answer is we're gonna have Muslim extremists attack malls because that's
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:38.560]  the intel we got to get concealed carry got to get people armed like Texas it
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:43.560]  was like just total two plus two equals four the default position statistics
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:47.760]  show it what's going on with the inner polehead and his last name is noble so
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:50.680]  I guess he's a noble person he just doesn't want to lie to everybody
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:54.000]  couldn't everybody just start being noble and then they can't fire everybody
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:58.000]  I actually think after speaking to some of these top guys that are so diluted
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.080]  that if they look at the statistics they can't even lie to themselves anymore
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:04.960]  because it's this weird thing where emotional reaction trumps facts now like
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:08.960]  with MSNBC if you watch MSNBC they mass shootings are down about 49% but they
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:11.800]  say they're up yeah I mean look at the 1930s you could go get a massive
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:15.120]  automatic weapon you can buy a naval ship now if you have the right credentials
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:19.200]  but there's no naval ship mass killings because it's only the qualified people
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:22.080]  getting them not anyone on the street can go out and get a naval ship and that's
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:25.040]  how it is right now they're always acting like oh we need background checks as
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:28.560]  if they don't exist or we're acting like we have there's no limitations on
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:32.200]  purchasing a gun and that's what's wrong go back to the 1930s and beyond that
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:36.200]  when there actually was no checks and everything was fine until about 1900 on
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:39.960]  average when you got out of prison for felonies even killing people they gave
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:44.040]  you your guns back yeah okay you just got punished for that now don't do it
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:48.360]  again it really has nothing to do with that when we look at this well they knew
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:51.920]  a guy's gonna go bad again's gonna get a gun anyway no I mean look no one wants
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:55.640]  to talk about the mass knifing as it was I think eight people killed from an
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:58.680]  exacto knife or it was like a pan or something like that it was in the news
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:01.800]  for like two hours and no one talked about it well in Japan that I've seen it
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:05.960]  where one time he killed 14 kids in minutes with a big sharp butcher knife
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:10.360]  it's actually easier to kill people sometimes with melee weapons than it is
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:13.680]  with a gun I mean but no one was talking about it slices and leaves the
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:17.920]  arteries open I mean look statistically we all know hammers hands and feet
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:20.920]  kill more than rifles hands and feet kill more than rifles hammers and
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:23.600]  clubs do as well well I mean I'm gonna say that even I took all our guns and
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:26.880]  I'm not the toughest kind of world but I mean I am a man I mean I'll guarantee
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:29.920]  I could I mean I could take as many guns I want with a butcher knife real fast
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:33.640]  yeah at about about I mean I got the will to walk up by it's my slit your
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:37.280]  throat from air to air wide open I got your gun right there what you gonna do
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:41.800]  about it I was told they're in training for attacking things like that for a
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:47.000]  military style at about 20 feet you opt to use a knife as opposed to a weapon as
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.960]  a as opposed to a gun anyway but no one talks about that it's the gun is evil
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:54.240]  remember the moms who we couldn't even find there was like less than five even
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:57.200]  my son and Tony admitted that there was less than 20 people overall probably like
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:02.000]  five people going the people that were anti-alamo resistance and liberty they
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.040]  were always obsessing over this ban assault weapons thing even on their
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:08.960]  pamphlets kept saying ban assault weapons they were acting as if assault
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:12.120]  weapons were evil but when confronting with statistics what did they do they
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:15.880]  screamed at us and attacked you we're out of time I'm gonna come back and do
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:19.440]  this report and then take phone calls for the entire third hour I promise folks
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:24.560]  I'm gonna go well actually yes yes the whole third hour is open I'm going right
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:28.280]  to your calls that's coming up briefly you showed me this we've had a bunch of
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:31.720]  tests go through but the lab we use who wants to name private because they're
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:36.040]  it's it's a private institution one of the top in the country obviously they
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:41.360]  get the most expensive tests not parts per million but even lower and I want to
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:46.320]  show Eurofins frontier global science is one of the top testers in the country
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:51.800]  was there's a $5,000 test Anthony I'm gonna show people a document cam on our
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:56.080]  nascent iodine the one-of-a-kind system infowarslife.com you can backorder it
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:59.000]  right now it'll be in the next few weeks you want to get in line for that we
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.680]  appreciate your support but tell folks about the numbers here we've never seen
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:06.760]  cadmium not detected even the best supplements and products you're gonna
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:12.880]  have some of it in there lead not detected at 0.003 less than no there's
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:16.240]  absolutely no detectable levels absolutely mercury was lovely tested
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:20.920]  down to mercury not detected 0.002 that's the level they tested down to
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:25.080]  yeah explain to people what that is okay so basically we've done products in
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.600]  the past we've done super high quality products in the past where there's no
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:31.360]  metal contamination and stuff like that but we've only look at it it's you know
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:36.840]  point zero one point whatever these are non detectable I've never ever seen that
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:40.600]  before and specifically looking at some of these tests with these Chinese
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:44.120]  products this is from Mike Adams some of the things he found when he did a test
[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:49.680]  was 29 parts per million of aluminum and point zero zero point eight parts
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:53.080]  per million of arsenic and zero point one parts per million of cadmium zero
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:57.360]  point two parts per million of lead and so the point is this is this is
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:02.400]  unbelievably clean in fours life.com exactly this is deep inside those who

[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:21.400]  it seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets which may make
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:27.080]  scarring particularly difficult even with this year's rule changes to recap
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:34.080]  those revisions women are still worth 10 points more than men in all age
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:42.960]  brackets but teenagers now rack up 40 points and toddlers 112 now rate a big
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:52.640]  70 points the big score anyone any sex over 75 years old has been up to 100
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:55:05.200]  points as always how fast you move determines how long you live. Resistance to

[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:19.200]  I'm Jakari Jackson with an Info Wars Nightly News Alert are you willing to
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:22.840]  fire upon Americans that's the question reportedly being asked of military
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:26.640]  personnel and who's asking this question United States government themselves
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:30.120]  according to the military personnel we've talked to retired Navy SEAL
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:34.440]  Benjamin Smith went on the Fox News channel revealing how he believes the
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:37.760]  United States government is trying to provoke veterans into a armed
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:41.880]  confrontation he was also on the Alex Jones radio show today telling us about
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:50.040]  the litmus test he was given. Going back to the beginning of this administration
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:56.400]  there were I've I've had friends within the community talking about how they
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:04.240]  were brought in and you know questioned with people from you know more towards
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:11.040]  the top side and the questioning resulted in kind of where the where it was
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:15.840]  pointing was you know do you feel comfortable disarming American citizens
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:20.600]  and you can see that now with the shedding of a lot of the officers and
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:24.880]  stuff like that it's it's you know we don't have the hundred percent track on
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:30.320]  it but you know there's a lot of funny things happening within military
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:35.640]  that's bombshell but I want to quantify that I have Secret Service FBI sources
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:40.360]  on record on the air but also covert sources that are currently in they say
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:44.680]  exactly that for two years there is a litmus test where officers from the
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:50.040]  generals down to lieutenant generals down to majors down to sergeant you know
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:54.880]  master sergeants will you fire on US citizens and if you say no you're sent
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:58.680]  to the worst hellhole or basically kicked out if you say yes you're put
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:02.680]  into special homeland security units quantify you're saying people in the
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:06.920]  community special warfare community are saying they have been brought into
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:14.200]  litmus test meetings yeah and at this at this moment in this conversation it's
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:23.680]  yeah I got it to bring it back to Van Jones oh yeah like you remember him when
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:29.280]  he said you have to like for us to have the argument or to just have the
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:34.400]  conversation logically and what he was saying with like the communist and the
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:39.000]  lefties and the everything that he banned Jones is it's you drop the radical
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:44.560]  pose for the radical ends and just to translate that into what this is you
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:51.640]  know I understand a lot of libertarian Ron Paul a lot of people that that are

[02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:18.320]  National Geographic Channel this Sunday the 27th 9 p.m. Eastern time and you
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:22.400]  live in Central's could be 8 o'clock there's a show coming out called American
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:26.440]  Blackout and I was gonna talk to you last week about it but I was at work
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:31.120]  about it but um I'm kind of thinking my question for you is I don't know if you
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:36.160]  remember that one show back in 2001 the lone gunman how it's a kind of like a
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:41.040]  precursor to time on the events of 9-11 sure sure they prepare you and then
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:45.440]  show you how to react when it actually happens and they said you know
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:48.800]  government's gonna have a drill takeover by remote control father playing in the
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:52.080]  World Trade Center blaming on Afghanistan and then bringing martial law in
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:56.320]  America that are six months before and the CIA did approach them and have them
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:02.360]  write that that came out in the news yes right I want to know do you think like
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:07.120]  I said there's a website to go to channel dot national geographic dot com
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:12.640]  forward slash channel forward slash American slash no I mean I've heard of
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:15.960]  the show I think it is all the condition is to get us ready because most of us
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:19.000]  aren't gonna have power all the time in the future anyway only government
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.680]  districts are gonna have it under agenda 21 that's all official that's how it is
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:27.320]  living in a Soviet nation I mean do I think that's conditioning yeah they're
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:31.560]  practicing how to turn the power grid on and off right now because it's easy to
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:34.600]  turn it off it's hard to turn it back on he was actually doing drills on this
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:39.000]  I'm not saying that's coming right away but they'd like to kill us if they could
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.560]  I mean the process of that is training us that they put their hands on our
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:46.800]  wives and kids and take our guns and turn our power off and bosses around I
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:50.600]  mean that's what they're doing they're breaking our will anything else Jonathan

[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:08.880]  year to go somewhere you'll have to get authorization on your smartphone this is

[02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:24.720]  I mean literally just feeding on you how's that sound I had no comment with
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:28.320]  that one man but God bless you I'm gonna jump no in every culture you would
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:31.760]  getting you get an elite who likes to be psychopathic so the druid elite would
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:35.360]  say I want your kids a sacrifice the Aztec said I want your kids a sacrifice
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:38.400]  the Babylonians said I want kids a sacrifice the Romans said I want your
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:41.520]  kids in the arena to sacrifice when a Roman Lord would die they would
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:46.560]  kill slaves fight to the death over the over it you know the psychopaths got
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:49.800]  control of some of the Norman they said when you know when the noble dies we
[02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:52.800]  burn your wife we don't want to listen to her that's actually a good custom I'm
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:56.400]  joking I mean all this stuff every culture they demand to murder you and
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:00.360]  then you bow and they man they cut your heart out and and then the priest class
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:05.460]  with the Aztecs and the Mayans and other Mayan cultures is all Mayan their the
[02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:10.920]  lower priest class made money off the daily sacrifices and every city had to
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:15.200]  have it you had to have meat and the premium the God wanted a child because
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:20.840]  you know chock mule or quits catlapodal or winged serpent they wanted you
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:23.320]  know because the God wanted the meat because obviously the priest tasted it
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:28.840]  that tasted better everybody knows veals better and long ham veals better and so
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:32.160]  they would hang the bodies down at the bottom of the pyramid and and then you
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:35.880]  would go and pay that you're offering the priest class to get a succulent
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:40.920]  slice and I mean what's wrong with that and I'll guarantee if you were against
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:44.080]  that you would have been called an extremist and every culture eight
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:47.800]  children I mean it's don't just say it's the Aztecs I mean they just kind of
[02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:51.760]  created a science and they had good agriculture with their chalupas that's
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:56.360]  what they called them these floating wooden rafts on rivers that you could
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:59.880]  get like five or six growth cycles a year not just two so they had a huge
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:06.800]  population and meat was on the dish I mean it's a who doesn't like me flesh
[02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:10.880]  human flesh tastes like pork they say it was delicious and succulent okay and I
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:14.000]  support it I support all government not supporting governments hateful and evil
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.360]  and I don't be an extremist now let's talk to Don and Tennessee Don you're on

[02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:58.440]  who think you're okay as the economy shuts down, think again. They're going to
[02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:03.000]  leverage them. Hundred million people that will be out of work against your
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:09.200]  pensions. The government will nationalize them and cut them in half day one. And then,
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:17.120]  in the years to come, they'll cut that even more until you have nothing, except
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:23.120]  paramilitary forces shooting you in the street if you can play. You asked for it,
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:29.760]  America. Now you're going to get it. But at least the president's going to smile
[02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:35.840]  at you while they dismantle your life and come after your gods because if that
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:42.160]  isn't enough for you, there's a great civil war added to the deal. Oh, the
[02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:50.120]  takedown of America was planned for a long time and now Morocco's sane Obama is
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:57.400]  the closer. Grinn and Barrett, say you enjoy it or you'll be called a racist and
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:02.200]  we know you'd throw your children into a mineshaft before you allowed that to
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:10.200]  happen. So, America, you want to be slaves? You are. Barack Obama, hail to the
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:17.640]  chief. Obama does America right. All right. There you go, folks. A little bit of
[02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:24.600]  equal time. We have that announcement from the White House for you. Oh, there's
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:33.200]  still some more White House music. There you go. More White House theme music.
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:45.600]  Hey, look at the bailout, boys and girls. Talk about cool. There's nothing
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:49.440]  better to bail out General Motors and ship it to China and Mexico and Brazil.
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:54.280]  You don't like that? Well, there's more coming where that came from and remember
[02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:58.400]  George Washington's bad, private property's bad and your kids don't belong to
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:03.440]  you or Rachel Maddow will call you a racist and we sure don't want some chick
[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:07.960]  know-it-all how to control, want to be man, telling us what to do so we better
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:12.640]  bow down to her, huh? That's what we do. All right, I apologize. I'm out of control.
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:16.320]  Yeah, just to tell the fellow from Tennessee and I want you to keep your
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:20.200]  pension fund you paid for, sir. They're going to take your pension fund once
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:24.680]  they're setting up Homeland Security to do that. That's it. It's set up. You
[02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:27.680]  notice this is all set up with the riot police going into place and
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:32.280]  everything just right on time. It's all prepared, but it's for your own good. I
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:39.120]  mean, you heard the theme song, folks. No more hail to the chief. Just for
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:41.960]  nostalgia. Can we go out with hail to the chief? You can find it all over the
[02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:47.800]  place. I mean, I just love our chief. I just love him so much right now. Let's go
[02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:55.360]  ahead and talk to Steve in Chicago. You're on the air, my friend. Welcome. Yes.
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:28:01.900]  Richard Gutierre. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's McGruff. Yeah. Hey,
[02:28:01.900 --> 02:28:06.920]  McGruff. McGruff, are you liking your Obamacare now? A little like today is
[02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:14.120]  Shoemaker can sign my shoes. He ain't shining your shoes, buddy. He's making
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:19.080]  international headlines. I mean, you really don't like Italians now, McGruff.
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:25.680]  What's your like, Obama? Like that governor, he'd be going into the
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:29.600]  federal building with a newspaper over his head. The guy from New Jersey at
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:36.400]  Crispy. Well, can you talk? I want to continue. You can say whatever you want.
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:41.560]  You got to do it in the full McGruff sound. Go ahead. Okay. You had a caller
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:45.520]  yesterday, Crypto caller that referred to British military intelligence in the
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:51.120]  Mideast. Yeah, he's exactly right. He talked about Kipling and of course
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:56.120]  Lawrence of Arabia. What we don't know, this is true though, the German Oriental
[02:28:56.120 --> 02:29:02.760]  Society was founded in 1897 and it was formed to combat Anglo-French interests
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:09.560]  in the Middle East. The idea of using Muslims as patsies to execute different
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:14.800]  attacks, this is well, well backed. I mean, that goes back to the Byzantines
[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:20.280]  with double cross people using, using Muslim or Mohammedans as they call them
[02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:25.520]  mercs. So this is actually about 600 years old snow more than that. Another
[02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:29.480]  Byzantines. Well, what was left of the Byzantine when it fell? No, no. Then
[02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:35.160]  Constantinople became, Constantinople became Istanbul. Hey, what? Stay there.
[02:29:35.160 --> 02:29:39.680]  I'm going to come back to you, McGruff, because I want you to say, I'm McGruff. Got

[02:33:56.240 --> 02:34:02.240]  With Kara King, I got to tell you polka is his thing. I'm in a really good mood
[02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:07.120]  today. I've hit equilibrium level with all the bad news.
[02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:10.160]  I'm just going to do whatever I can to fight it. I realize just fighting the
[02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:14.160]  evil is the journey. The journey is the destination and we're going to do
[02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:18.640]  whatever we can. Our fear is gone. We're going to fight the tyranny.

[02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:27.920]  to reignite the human spirit. Yeah! All right now I'm going to go back to
[02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:31.360]  Stephen Chicago and then get to Shane, Cindy, Robert, Mike, everybody try to go
[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:34.400]  to you quickly and hit some of this news but I got to do it because I got to say
[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:39.520]  Steve's been calling. I think it was about 1998 when I was
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:43.840]  first on the radio in Chicago. We're on 1530 right now. It's another station then.
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:49.520]  He's been calling and I got to be honest. I can't figure out who he really is.
[02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:53.200]  Sometimes he's called in and been mad at me
[02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:56.720]  and I can't tell. All I know is he may be is the guy that did the McGruff
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:02.400]  Crime Dog voices alive. This may actually because he could almost beat.
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:04.960]  For those who don't know when I was a kid they had McGruff the crime dog and I
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:07.600]  always liked how he helped take a bite out of crime.
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:11.280]  I'm telling you he could almost beat a voice
[02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:15.680]  analyzer system. They found some cases people's voices are so similar
[02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:19.440]  that they can actually beat a voice print analysis. This may be we're going to
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:22.880]  find out in a moment if he is the voice of McGruff the crime dog. Let's play the
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:28.000]  McGruff Crime Dog ad PSA and then public service announcement
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:34.560]  and then go back to Steve in Chicago to make his point. Here it is.
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:38.080]  That's Jenny but that's not Jenny's dad.
[02:35:38.080 --> 02:35:42.640]  If she gets into that car that may be the last time you'll see Jenny.
[02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:47.360]  I'm McGruff the crime dog. See those kids? Every day in this country
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:54.400]  sixty kids disappear. Some run away. I know. I loaded them on the C-130 or even
[02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:58.960]  by people they know. We had the auction in Los Vegas to protect
[02:35:58.960 --> 02:36:02.240]  themselves. The seats and others flew in. Some
[02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:06.800]  Rothschilds were there. I am McGruff and the way we control things is
[02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:10.800]  we tell you we run the whole operation to save the kids when we're actually
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:14.320]  running most of it. Occasionally when some psychopath on his own gets a
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:18.240]  kid we'll grandstand around all day about it but the truth is we killed a lot
[02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:21.360]  of your kids and by the way the narcotics kids I'm
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:24.400]  telling you not to use drugs so you introduce them to you just like the
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:28.240]  anti-bullying training makes you bully and just like the
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:32.640]  suicide anti-suicide prevention makes the kids triple the suicides
[02:36:32.640 --> 02:36:35.200]  then we give you pills that make you do it more.
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:39.280]  I'm McGruff here for little kids. How you doing little kids? I'm an expert in
[02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:43.680]  getting people into cars. Hey seriously though Steve are you related
[02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:48.000]  to McGruff the crime dog or are you McGruff the crime dog?
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:53.520]  No. I'm a Rabbi Schmiley Schmalsen. Schmiley because I was always Schmiley in
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:57.920]  my rabbinical class. I'll smoothly I'll sue you in Rabbi
[02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:01.200]  Court. Schmalsen because I was the smallest man
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:06.880]  in in my rabbis class. You know what I wanted to do.
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:11.840]  Hey do you want to talk to Goosey Artie? I mean do you really not like Italians?
[02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:16.880]  I like Italians. No I wanted to talk about German Oriental Society
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:21.280]  1897 and that spawned the rogue agent
[02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:25.520]  Muhammad Atta. He was funded by the German Oriental
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:29.600]  Society and they started in 1897 getting back to what I
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:32.400]  was talking about. That gentleman who wanted to know
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:36.880]  about espionage look up the name Fritz Frank and the other name he would look
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:42.400]  up would be Richard Meistershall again and I'll spell it M-E-N-T-E-R-Z.
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:44.960]  No no no I know what you're saying is actually historical you're an interesting
[02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:50.960]  guy. How long have you been calling? Oh I say a decade or so.
[02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:54.880]  No I think longer than that. It's longer than a decade.
[02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:58.000]  Okay. I remember doing radio shows at my house
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:03.440]  over an ISD in line with you with with you calling in.
[02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:07.680]  Okay. Another one is... Hold on McGrath. Hold on McGrath. I'm asking you
[02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:10.800]  are you McGrath the crime dog?
[02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:17.520]  Wow wow no no that's that that's not one of my multiple
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:20.960]  personalities. By the way Goosey Artie really liked you talking
[02:38:20.960 --> 02:38:23.840]  bad about it. I mean I want you to do some more. He's right outside laughing.
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:27.120]  What do you want to say to Goosey Artie?
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:33.120]  Ciao ciao. So I'll let me guess are are you Italian?
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:39.280]  No. Hell no. I'm a European. What do you think? Oh so you're oh so
[02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:42.720]  so are you serious you're such a white supremacist than Italians.
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:46.240]  Even if they're Northern Italy they're not white people right?
[02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:52.640]  Right. Man I gotta tell you but I can't figure you out.
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:56.480]  Are you really for Obamacare? Are you really for Obamacare?
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:00.080]  To a certain extent but I wanted to get back to the Middle East
[02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:03.600]  Kress von Kressenstein. You talk about the Germans.
[02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:07.680]  He wrote a book from Constantinople to the Suez Canal. He was there in World
[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:10.960]  War I. He was World War I general. The first battle of Gaza.
[02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:14.640]  He beat the crap out of the Limies and the Hymes together.
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:18.400]  This is for the Gaza Strip. The second battle he beat the hell out of him.
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:22.480]  What's the point? In a six-day war this guy
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:26.000]  he already had planned and back in the World War I
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:29.440]  the the bridging of the Suez Canal. So what did the Israeli
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:33.040]  general staff do that Diane with the one patch on his eye?
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:38.240]  He plagiarized the German plan. Take a look at it. It's Kress von Kressenstein.
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:41.840]  It's spelled with it. No no I'm aware of that. I'm aware that the Israelis also
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:44.320]  run radical Muslim groups. That's even in Haritz and
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:47.840]  here's one post. And you always are bashing everyone with the Germans.
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:51.600]  You don't like the Limies but your great leader Hitler
[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:57.600]  thought the Brits were more more Aryan than the Germans.
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:02.640]  Well I I'm not uh supporting them with the German Oriental Society.
[02:40:02.640 --> 02:40:06.160]  I mean you can look at him. No no you take a look at
[02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:08.800]  Hamburg right now. That's the reason why they got raised.
[02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:13.040]  Listen let's get serious here for a minute. Really tell us about yourself.
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:20.720]  I mean what'd you do? How old are you? I'm a senior. I'm 60.
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:26.480]  Yeah you didn't sound you didn't sound exactly like McGrath 15 years ago.
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:30.640]  Well no I don't think so. I hope not. I didn't look like him either.
[02:40:30.640 --> 02:40:35.440]  This guy's really funny. All right man I appreciate your call. There goes McGrath.
[02:40:35.440 --> 02:40:38.000]  Oh hold on hold on. I'm sorry he's still there Steve.
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:42.480]  I forgot to give him to say a liner for Info Wars. Hi I'm McGrath. Don't look at
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:45.840]  Info Wars. It's thought crime.
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:51.040]  Man I messed up. Cindy. I tell you what leave a line open. Leave a line open.
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:59.440]  800-259-9231. Call back Steve. We'll use you as a liner. Call right back 800-259-9231.
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:01.200]  Now everybody's calling and they'll never get into that line.
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:07.920]  I'm telling you like I would want to win dinner with that guy if he lived in Austin.
[02:41:08.800 --> 02:41:11.920]  I mean you know you'd be rolling two hours at dinner with him
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:16.160]  before you find out what was really going on. Okay let's go ahead and talk to Cindy
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:22.880]  in FEMA Region 2. Go ahead Cindy you're on the air. Yeah this is Cindy calling in from
[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:27.920]  occupied FEMA Region 3. How loving. What form or state are you in?
[02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:35.600]  Pennsylvania. Okay welcome. Free America Radio. That's what I consider the solace.
[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:42.320]  That's what it is. I bless you ma'am. Anyway I served in the military in the 70s.
[02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:50.640]  I was a United States Army stationed at Fort Sam Houston, Texas and what I was calling in for
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:57.120]  in response to the young national guardsmen who spoke earlier. During the 70s we held that
[02:41:57.120 --> 02:42:04.080]  oath very dearly and I still here hold it dearly to this day. My advice to anybody in the military
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:10.800]  at this time is when they ask them will they turn against Americans to say yes we will and then
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:17.360]  find out who each other is and when they bring that long arm of evil down on Americans they need
[02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:25.200]  to arrest those officers giving out those unjust orders. They need to arrest them. I don't care
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:29.760]  what they do with them. They need to grab them up and they need to fight with them. By the way I
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:34.960]  was told that by my great uncle who just died a few months ago who was in all sorts of just above
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:40.800]  top secret super black stuff and he said it was well known that was talked back then because
[02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:45.280]  governments always want to know they can take over and and there was talk about COG and gun
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:50.400]  confiscation and there would be generals in the officers club saying we're gonna you know shoot
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:54.960]  anybody that talks like that. I mean that was just default we'll kill anybody talks like that
[02:42:55.680 --> 02:43:00.640]  and nowadays it's like they're getting ready to come try to take the guns. I mean the only reason
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:05.840]  America couldn't be taken over by a coup and take the guns is because the military the country was
[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:10.640]  founded over you're not taking our guns. That's the only reason they haven't gotten them completely
[02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:16.240]  yet and so exactly back in your time in the 70s they had manuals and the officers would teach.
[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:20.160]  If you're ever told to take guns you know unless it's from a particular criminal in an emergency
[02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:24.320]  but from the general public you don't follow those orders and of course you know what else they said
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:29.520]  back then. I don't even want to repeat it in this day and age and how much how bad stuff is but
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:33.120]  I mean what did you guys talk about if they ever said take the guns when you were in the military?
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:40.240]  We said hell no. Well they also said they were gonna do something else so the point is yeah I mean
[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:45.360]  it's just it's just we but now it's here. I mean they with a straight face say families are bad
[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:51.440]  freedoms bad private properties bad fathers are bad veterans are bad George Washington's bad I mean
[02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:57.360]  it's just like it's they've learned the trick of hiding in plain view. I mean yeah go ahead.
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:03.600]  We know the difference though. There's more of us awake than they realize and we need to
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:09.840]  take our military back from within. My dad was a presidential honor guard to Harry S. Truman. He
[02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:16.080]  was also a Berger and he hid within and I'm a daughter of the American Revolution as well.
[02:44:17.840 --> 02:44:24.880]  I still hold that oath to this day. I'll fight for liberty or death. I'll die for my country
[02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:30.480]  and anybody in the military who doesn't think that they have to put their life up for this country
[02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:34.480]  they're mistaken. Well think about that. Think about that. That's a great point. You fight for all
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:38.160]  these fake globalist wars. You've got to still admire the courage of the people that do it and
[02:44:38.160 --> 02:44:45.440]  stick together but the point is this is America. This is for the Republic. This is here. Now go ahead.
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:50.960]  They won't have they won't get a second chance. They will not get a second chance. They're given
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:56.160]  they're given out orders that aren't to be followed whatever orders they're told to follow.
[02:44:56.160 --> 02:45:01.520]  If that is not in their oath they should not follow them and they should turn on those given
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:07.920]  them arrest them whatever they have to do to them get them and take our military back because we
[02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:13.520]  need our military working for us. That's right. We owe it to our ancestors. We owe it to us and we
[02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:20.320]  owe it to our future and we best most foremost and first of all we owe it to our God and country.
[02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:25.120]  That's right. God bless you man. Beautiful words and that's just it's not even a knowledge. Just
[02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:30.960]  I know it my being. First comes God. It's really strange in what I'm worried about it. I mean I
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:38.000]  love my children more than anything but it's like and I've got to be honest it's God my ancestors
[02:45:39.840 --> 02:45:43.280]  and then my children and then my wife and
[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:50.000]  but I know why that's the instinct because those are the people that provided and built a
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:54.480]  foundation for us that wasn't perfect but it's a lot better what we see now that went through hell
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:46:00.480]  and then it all goes for nothing if we lose that. I mean it's that's all that matters is freedom.
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:06.000]  Don't all you people get it bought out by the New World Order for some chicken feed for a new car
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:13.440]  for a fancier house so so you can have more jump to mess with and look I got things but I'm a target
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:17.920]  I understand having money so you can defend yourself a little bit of money and so you're not
[02:46:17.920 --> 02:46:22.400]  under people's control. I want people to be wealthy but wealthy in the free market it's a much bigger
[02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:28.000]  cornucopia than any other collectivist system and we know that it doesn't work but they lie to each
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:32.240]  group and say oh it's going to be great for you and by the way here's the new article up on
[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:39.040]  info wars.com by Steve Watson it's also on prisonplot.com nut job Obama supporters believe
[02:46:39.040 --> 02:46:44.960]  healthcare.gov disaster is part of right wing conspiracy. No the right wing controlled if you
[02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:55.920]  want to call that Republican written old guard you know John McCain Carl Rove George Bush Republicans
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:47:02.800]  the Mitt Romney Republicans they are the conspiracy of the right care dummies they wrote it you idiots
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:08.080]  along with other fat cat democrats you morons. I knew they do this they are just the dumbest
[02:47:08.800 --> 02:47:12.800]  I gotta say it I mean I'm not a Republican folks but I lean more towards that because
[02:47:12.800 --> 02:47:17.760]  they're pro-gun and anti-abortion and stuff but I mean I cannot believe how dumb Democrats are
[02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:22.720]  and no wonder all their shows on CNN, MSNBC or how smart they are because that's to cover up the
[02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:29.200]  fact that they have constituents that are literally idiots. I mean I've never seen anything like it
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:36.400]  and he's got a whole thing with their tweets and news articles and I'm sure the Koch brothers
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:43.200]  can afford some sabotage. I love this the the I always call them the Koch brothers the Koch
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:47.040]  brothers I love how that's the little neurotic thing that if you work for the Koch brothers you
[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:51.840]  work for the Koch brothers you work for the Koch brothers when I have absolutely zero connection to
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:57.200]  them but I tell you they would be good guys if they were actually funding me I wish that I wish
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:48:01.680]  somebody was helping us. The point is I have experts on they actually bankrolled Bill Clinton
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:07.440]  and helped put him in office they just fund both sides. I mean they've had fights with George Soros
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:16.800]  so that's I mean it's literally the moron level of these people just incredible so they're now
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:32.160]  saying that we need Obamacare and that it's a great thing absolutely off the chart insane oh boy
[02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:40.240]  Obama asked America to be a part of Team Obamacare I told you it's now going to be a process
[02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:47.680]  that's another article up there by Steve Watson I guess he wrote two articles back to back Obama
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:53.600]  asked Americans to be part of Team Obamacare see I told you now now we've all got to work
[02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:58.720]  towards the free and oh national service and oh there is it isn't free see that's collectivism oh
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:03.200]  you didn't know you're a slave now no you just thought you got everything free they could take
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:06.880]  all the wealthy and rich people's money that's actually in the US and it wouldn't fund the
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:13.920]  government for one year what it does is give the globalist opposition to their takeover and
[02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:18.000]  and economic groups they've got to compete with so that's why they want to shut it down the goal
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:24.320]  is shut down your prosperity dumb bows and then you could only go to government for select handouts
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:29.360]  and the government can pick the winners they want a monopoly dumb bows I'm talking to Obama supporters
[02:49:30.160 --> 02:49:36.080]  stop being such incredibly stupid morons I know you got some free stuff before that was in the
[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:40.960]  domestication process dumbasses excuse me I shouldn't talk like that I apologize God help me
[02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:48.240]  I just have to I mean you are the dumbest sacks of crap excuse me I mean I'm telling you they're
[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:55.360]  ripping the country apart it's a giant scam job and I knew you would still suck your thumbs and
[02:49:55.360 --> 02:50:01.280]  think it was a good deal for you and drag me and my family down a rattle with you towards poverty
[02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:07.120]  I love this country and I care about you and I want you to have a chance and a future you idiots
[02:50:08.080 --> 02:50:11.440]  and then you sit there talking about how we're with the Koch brothers
[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:17.840]  and actually have people I know like lift their finger and go you like Rand Paul that means you're
[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:22.400]  secretly with the Koch brothers I'm like Rand Paul barely beat the gun bill Rand Paul's against

[02:54:22.560 --> 02:54:27.920]  people were still armed in many areas but they're arming against us they're openly training for war
[02:54:27.920 --> 02:54:32.800]  with us we're in the same position padrick henry was in when he said these weapons are for us
[02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:36.560]  they're amassing these armies they're training to take us on they say they are they're going to come
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:43.440]  and take our guns they're going to denture us as slaves boom it started and i'm here i screw around
[02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:47.600]  have some fun because i can't stay serious you know all the time and not go crazy but i mean we
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:54.720]  are just i can't believe how openly evil it is and that more people aren't totally freaking out
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:55:00.480]  i mean folks should be freaking out instead most people i talk to even cops in some military
[02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:04.560]  they go i know you're right well we're we're i'm scared i don't know what to do and
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:12.400]  we're talking quietly you better stop talking quietly i mean these are criminals they're illegitimate
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:20.080]  belling up through pure intimidation hoping we just bow down and if we don't stand it's all over
[02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:24.400]  folks it's that simple people say well you should do this better do that better look i never wanted
[02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:29.040]  to be a leader i never expected all this to happen they tried to ban a bunch of our guns in texas
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:33.680]  i saw them taking farmers property and not paying for it and i already read a lot of history books
[02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:40.240]  and it was tyranny and i got involved 20 years ago i'm just a regular guy who is not going to be a
[02:55:40.240 --> 02:55:44.400]  slave and has an instinct to fight back and folks i believe in you i believe you have that same
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:51.520]  instinct you're going to have to get aggressive talking to people doing whatever and not complying
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:55.840]  not bowing down you see cops drive over to them start asking them what's going on they'll
[02:55:55.840 --> 02:56:00.160]  have their mouth open that you would dare pull up at a coffee shop and talk to them or they might go
[02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:04.560]  oh i know what's going on hey how you doing let's get some you'll find out a lot of them are good
[02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:08.640]  a lot of them are bad they're arrogant and weird they'll hey aren't you a servant i just want to
[02:56:08.640 --> 02:56:13.840]  talk to you now that federal training's really got to you and a lot of times they'll kind of

[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:22.960]  name they're bad you go visit the police chief and if he doesn't see you you actually has a public
[02:56:22.960 --> 02:56:28.720]  event and you go talk to him the mafia comes and talks people and gets in people's faces
[02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:35.120]  and threatens them we come as the citizens and say hey you stop pushing us around that's why
[02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:40.560]  they want first contact with us these checkpoints and things to get us bathed and baptized in slavery
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:45.440]  cops you're bathing your family in slavery oh they'll always have some cover story of why
[02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:49.440]  you're doing a checkpoint or why you're raiding something illegally or why you're doing this
[02:56:49.440 --> 02:56:53.440]  or that or why you're violating the constitution they're going to get you used to violate the
[02:56:53.440 --> 02:56:58.480]  constitution they're going to flip it around on you and your family they're going to turn that gun

[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:16.480]  choice they're going to have to try to get the guns because there are too many people who are
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:20.640]  getting to the power they can't feed their families and they're gonna take action that's right that's
[02:57:20.640 --> 02:57:26.240]  right going for the guns will be the false flag because it will start a civil war i mean they
[02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:30.880]  know it will start a civil war it will kill unbelievable amounts of citizens and cops in
[02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:35.600]  military so people better be reaching out to military police so that we don't have to have
