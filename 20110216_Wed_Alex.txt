[00:00:04.911 --> 00:00:06.212]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.212 --> 00:00:07.993]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.993 --> 00:00:09.733]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.334]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.334 --> 00:00:12.875]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:17.057]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.057 --> 00:00:21.179]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:28.243]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:28.243 --> 00:00:33.486]  It is Wednesday, the 16th day of February 2011.
[00:00:33.486 --> 00:00:37.629]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:47.055]  We're going to be talking about activism and the political awakening happening all across the world with Luke Radowsky, founder of We Are Change, in the last hour today.
[00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:54.060]  In the meantime, there is a just massive amount of vital news and information that we're going to be covering.
[00:00:55.641 --> 00:01:00.006]  In the first hour, I want to have open phones for first-time callers.
[00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:01.728]  First-time callers only.
[00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:05.793]  In the second hour, it will be a complete and total free-for-all for everybody.
[00:01:05.793 --> 00:01:07.695]  Love to hear from all of you.
[00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:10.138]  Any issue or item you want to discuss, first-time callers, 800-259-9231.
[00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:19.058]  Obviously, there have been big new developments in the Middle East continuing to unfold.
[00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:23.120]  The Suez Canal workers stage sit-in as U.S.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.023]  warships are dispatched and Marines prepare to enter the country.
[00:01:28.023 --> 00:01:31.885]  Presidential Medal of Freedom given to former President George H.W.
[00:01:31.885 --> 00:01:34.486]  Bush and 14 others.
[00:01:34.486 --> 00:01:36.167]  Why not give a Medal of Freedom to Stalin?
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.980]  I think?
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:15.031]  You name it just a complete rollout Trying to basically have the TSA be seen as some type of messianic rock stars or movie stars Meanwhile the security situation continues to deteriorate in Mexico.
[00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:26.699]  We're going to be going over that as well today We're gonna look at some positive news from Rand Paul continuing to deliver on his promises.
[00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.580]  He wants a 500 billion dollar cut
[00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:41.070]  He's supporting his father in the audit of the Fed and he is promising to try to block the reauthorization of the US Senate of the USA Patriot Act.
[00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.274]  So he is certainly delivering on what he promised to do.
[00:02:46.274 --> 00:02:48.316]  And that leads us into Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:53.800]  The first thing I'm going to cover when we come back is not just Rand Paul, but Ron Paul.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.681]  Fox News has been caught
[00:02:56.642 --> 00:03:00.223]  In an extremely wicked, dirty trick.
[00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:04.285]  And there really should be some repercussions for this.
[00:03:04.285 --> 00:03:13.548]  If they did something deceptive like this on someone I don't like, like Barack Obama, or Dick Cheney, I would be screaming and hopping up and down, concerned.
[00:03:14.941 --> 00:03:16.643]  But they did this to Ron Paul.
[00:03:16.643 --> 00:03:22.189]  Of course they wouldn't do this to Dick Cheney or Barack Obama or a fellow globalist.
[00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.551]  They would only do this to somebody like Ron Paul.
[00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:34.982]  They have been caught absolutely red-handed playing video reportedly of Ron Paul being booed at CPAC and it's a lie.
[00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:37.146]  It's a fraud.
[00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:38.226]  It's a fake.
[00:03:38.226 --> 00:03:39.827]  And we're going to break that down the other side.
[00:03:39.827 --> 00:03:41.968]  And they are admittedly caught.
[00:03:41.968 --> 00:03:44.049]  They have admittedly been dinged.
[00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.792]  When I saw this last night, I couldn't believe it.
[00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:52.374]  I actually went to cspan.org.
[00:03:52.374 --> 00:03:56.055]  They have all of it archived there for free, the audio and video of it.
[00:03:56.055 --> 00:04:02.118]  And did go to the video where they announced the winner of the CPAC coveted poll to Ron Paul.
[00:04:02.118 --> 00:04:04.400]  Unbelievable standing ovation.
[00:04:05.433 --> 00:04:08.394]  All you hear is this thunderous applause.
[00:04:08.394 --> 00:04:13.376]  If you watch Fox News, it's complete and total booing.
[00:04:13.376 --> 00:04:18.638]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, this is outrageous.
[00:04:18.638 --> 00:04:20.459]  And you know who runs Fox News?
[00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:31.404]  It's the Karl Rove slash Roger Ailes arm of Rhino Neocons, who poses conservatives so they can control
[00:04:32.344 --> 00:04:35.565]  The conservative movement in this country that threatens the new world order.
[00:04:35.565 --> 00:04:36.385]  Period.
[00:04:36.385 --> 00:04:40.606]  This is so important, and I'm going to break it all down on the other side.
[00:04:40.606 --> 00:04:51.208]  Then, USA Today, Killswitch internet bill, alarms, privacy experts, and so much more.
[00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:55.529]  We'll tell you what the latest from Bernie Madoff saying the big banks had to know what he was doing.
[00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:56.349]  Of course they did.
[00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.570]  It is all coming up today.
[00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:59.190]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.535 --> 00:05:04.118]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:05:04.118 --> 00:05:05.420]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.804]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:05:09.804 --> 00:05:15.749]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.911]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:05:17.911 --> 00:05:20.594]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:05:20.934 --> 00:05:27.418]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:05:27.418 --> 00:05:29.639]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.982]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:05:34.982 --> 00:05:40.264]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:05:40.264 --> 00:05:45.627]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:05:45.627 --> 00:05:48.569]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:54.073]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:05:54.073 --> 00:05:59.117]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:05:59.117 --> 00:06:01.119]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:08.044]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:06:08.044 --> 00:06:10.306]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:06:10.586 --> 00:06:15.968]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:06:15.968 --> 00:06:19.009]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:21.330]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:27.572]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:06:27.572 --> 00:06:30.953]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:06:30.953 --> 00:06:36.735]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:06:36.735 --> 00:06:38.376]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:06:38.376 --> 00:06:39.516]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:06:39.676 --> 00:06:42.337]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:06:42.337 --> 00:06:46.559]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:51.181]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:06:51.181 --> 00:06:53.782]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:06:53.782 --> 00:06:56.784]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:06:56.784 --> 00:06:57.404]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:03.887]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:07:03.887 --> 00:07:10.289]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:17.672]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:07:17.672 --> 00:07:22.553]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:07:22.553 --> 00:07:24.674]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:07:27.495 --> 00:07:31.237]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:07:31.237 --> 00:07:33.538]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[00:07:53.549 --> 00:07:53.989]  Thank you!
[00:08:05.168 --> 00:08:10.012]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.012 --> 00:08:11.593]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.593 --> 00:08:13.135]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.135 --> 00:08:17.338]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.338 --> 00:08:21.421]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.382 --> 00:08:32.323]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:32.323 --> 00:08:38.047]  It is Wednesday, the 16th day of February, 2011.
[00:08:38.047 --> 00:08:41.149]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:47.093]  USA Today headline, Kill Switch Internet Bill Alarms Privacy Experts.
[00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:51.456]  How about people that want to have free speech in this country?
[00:08:52.116 --> 00:08:52.396]  Bernie Madoff
[00:09:09.457 --> 00:09:13.420]  From prison, Madoff says banks had to know of fraud.
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.521]  Of course they did.
[00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:17.864]  They were deeply involved in all of it.
[00:09:17.864 --> 00:09:22.248]  Also, they've been reporting that Hazim Abbar was in a coma or dead the last three or four days.
[00:09:22.248 --> 00:09:24.750]  Now they say that he is reportedly near death.
[00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.250]  in Egypt.
[00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:32.492]  First, they'd said that he'd been in Israel for the last, what, four or five days, or I guess longer, since Friday.
[00:09:32.492 --> 00:09:34.573]  No one really knows where he is.
[00:09:34.573 --> 00:09:36.853]  So I guess that's almost six days.
[00:09:36.853 --> 00:09:42.435]  We're going to be going over all of that, continuing with our look at North Africa and the Middle East.
[00:09:42.435 --> 00:09:46.376]  The Suez Canal workers stage sit-in as U.S.
[00:09:46.376 --> 00:09:50.437]  warships have been dispatched.
[00:09:50.437 --> 00:09:52.138]  We're going to be breaking that down today.
[00:09:53.078 --> 00:10:09.082]  But I also want to just give you the note that Gerald Solente will be joining us coming up in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast on the economy and the revolutions that are popping up worldwide driven by increased food prices via dollar devaluation and other factors.
[00:10:09.082 --> 00:10:18.023]  And Luke Rodowski will also be joining us for 30 minutes to talk about his incredible confrontation of Dick Cheney at CPAC.
[00:10:18.023 --> 00:10:20.044]  Now, mentioning CPAC.
[00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:29.433]  I do not have words to describe how naked the corruption of Fox News is.
[00:10:29.433 --> 00:10:33.875]  And you know I criticize MSNBC, I criticize CNN.
[00:10:33.875 --> 00:10:50.281]  These groups all basically have goals via the establishment to suppress the population's political awakening and to basically play the population of the United States off against each other.
[00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:54.282]  And that is clearly what is happening today.
[00:10:54.282 --> 00:11:00.265]  CNN is more to an international audience and tries to play the middle as if they're nonpartisan.
[00:11:00.265 --> 00:11:09.189]  MSNBC is filled with extreme kind of fake left vitriol and race baiting.
[00:11:09.189 --> 00:11:13.250]  If you don't like government-run health care, then you are a
[00:11:16.613 --> 00:11:17.974]  Racist.
[00:11:17.974 --> 00:11:20.936]  If you don't give up your guns, you're a racist.
[00:11:20.936 --> 00:11:23.557]  And then you look at Fox News.
[00:11:23.557 --> 00:11:25.158]  What is Fox News there for?
[00:11:25.158 --> 00:11:26.479]  They're rhinos.
[00:11:26.479 --> 00:11:28.540]  They're Republicans in name only.
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:45.171]  It is their job to suppress and to control the libertarian slash conservative movement in this country that at its roots threatens the globalist agenda of one world government, cashless society, controlled grids,
[00:11:46.311 --> 00:11:48.510]  Global SDRs.
[00:11:50.373 --> 00:11:56.415]  The Patriot Act, the surveillance grid, the military industrial complex takeover of this country.
[00:11:56.415 --> 00:12:01.096]  So the Democrats bought and paid for by the same offshore slash Wall Street interest.
[00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:08.718]  They're there to put out a political narrative that is attractive and manipulative towards people that see themselves as leftists.
[00:12:08.718 --> 00:12:17.701]  Fox News is there to kind of keep Republicans on the mainline, fake, plastic, conservative front.
[00:12:19.466 --> 00:12:32.513]  And they're also there, of course, to continue that left-right paradigm balkanization division that we talk so much about.
[00:12:32.513 --> 00:12:36.416]  Now, illustrating this is the fact that
[00:12:37.349 --> 00:12:48.891]  For decades, Rush Limbaugh, and for the last decade or so, Fox Television, Fox News, have made endless jokes about people that are worried about a police state.
[00:12:48.891 --> 00:12:51.112]  People that don't like the private fellow reserve.
[00:12:51.112 --> 00:12:54.412]  People that criticize the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:12:54.412 --> 00:13:03.994]  When all of these organizations openly are pushing for world government, and true patriots that are aware of this threat have been covering it and trying to warn the people.
[00:13:03.994 --> 00:13:06.275]  So for as long as they could,
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:19.166]  Fox News tried to paint anyone that talked about real issues with a tinfoil hat paintbrush.
[00:13:20.262 --> 00:13:37.548]  But in the last three or four years, there have been so many AP and Financial Times of London and Newsweek and Time Magazine articles and so many open announcements by the G20 and the United Nations that indeed a private world government is being established.
[00:13:38.428 --> 00:13:45.271]  That indeed, a system of planetary corporate rule is being created.
[00:13:45.271 --> 00:13:52.835]  That indeed, a program of forced world population reduction and one-child policy is real.
[00:13:52.835 --> 00:14:06.941]  So it's gone from academic papers and the geopolitical preparations for this, and the unification of laws, the continuity of agenda, to now the attempt to accelerate the implementation of this.
[00:14:08.228 --> 00:14:19.603]  And so Fox has gone from saying none of this exists to having Dick Morris on routinely on shows like Hannity.
[00:14:20.914 --> 00:14:27.837]  And he says, yes, the conspiracy theorists were nuts, saying it was a plan for a world government and a world currency, but now they're right.
[00:14:27.837 --> 00:14:45.786]  And they put Glenn Beck out to basically cover that niche of awakening libertarians and conservatives, but only so they have your confidence when they bring in the next messianic Republican leader, which is any major Republican presidential contender other than Ron Paul.
[00:14:47.185 --> 00:15:05.373]  And I take you back to CNN and Fox, going back three years ago on CNN, the last two years with Glenn Beck, on his own radio show and TV, he'll have Glenn, Glenn Beck will have Ron Paul on, he will say he's a good guy, and then call him a kook right after it.
[00:15:06.053 --> 00:15:09.096]  Or he'll say Ron Paul supporters want a money bomb.
[00:15:09.096 --> 00:15:11.157]  They may want to blow things up.
[00:15:11.157 --> 00:15:12.418]  They might be terrorists.
[00:15:12.418 --> 00:15:14.200]  The army may need to be used against them.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.442]  If you don't know about that clip, just pull it up.
[00:15:16.442 --> 00:15:19.744]  Glenn Beck says army may need to be used against Ron Paul supporters.
[00:15:19.744 --> 00:15:25.589]  He says the army may need to be used against these domestic threats.
[00:15:25.589 --> 00:15:26.910]  So we have all of that going on.
[00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:31.674]  And we have Fox News famously with people they don't like, taking photos of them,
[00:15:32.651 --> 00:15:37.875]  Changing the color to a green or yellow hue, deforming the faces.
[00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:40.557]  They've been caught a lot doing this.
[00:15:40.557 --> 00:15:56.428]  And you really get to see who the system's afraid of when the Democrats are out there saying Ron Paul can't win, even though he's won CPAC two years in a row and is winning most scientific polls as the number one slot right now as the presidential contender, the best chance to beat Barack Obama.
[00:15:57.128 --> 00:16:02.113]  In some polls it's still Mitt Romney, but most polls Ron Paul's number one, and the other polls he's number two.
[00:16:02.113 --> 00:16:10.460]  So you've got people like Trump saying he can't win, creating this self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:21.130]  But right after Ron Paul won the CPAC poll, Fox News knowingly cut to last year in a staged Mitt Romney event,
[00:16:21.994 --> 00:16:35.960]  Where they booed him and that was staged last year where Fox had their microphone in the Mitt Romney contingent so that it would sound like they were over booing the cheers for Ron Paul when he won.
[00:16:37.438 --> 00:16:39.379]  That was staged and came out last year.
[00:16:39.379 --> 00:16:40.840]  This is even worse.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:17:00.933]  This year, they ignored the live C-SPAN feed, or their own live feed, with the same guy announcing in the same background from last year, and they played last year's feed of Ron Paul being booed, and then put Ron Paul on live and said, what do you think of them just booing you?
[00:17:00.933 --> 00:17:03.235]  And Ron Paul said, well, I didn't see it, so I don't know.
[00:17:04.485 --> 00:17:05.926]  This is a hoax.
[00:17:05.926 --> 00:17:09.508]  This is Fox News insulting their listeners.
[00:17:09.508 --> 00:17:14.691]  Treating you like you're a complete and total absolute moron.
[00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:18.132]  And they cannot be trusted at any level.
[00:17:18.132 --> 00:17:19.673]  And it's despicable.
[00:17:19.673 --> 00:17:21.594]  The people want Ron Paul.
[00:17:21.594 --> 00:17:27.577]  If the media even halfway acknowledges this, he will be the next president of the United States.
[00:17:27.577 --> 00:17:32.060]  A guy who's never compromised, has a perfect voting record, who will risk his life.
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.661]  You better believe they're gonna come after him physically.
[00:17:34.341 --> 00:17:38.425]  To try to abolish the Federal Reserve and restore the Republic.
[00:17:38.425 --> 00:17:39.707]  And what does Fox News do?
[00:17:39.707 --> 00:17:44.152]  They run a PSYOP hoax and they've not responded to this.
[00:17:44.152 --> 00:17:46.634]  I demand that they respond to this.
[00:17:47.967 --> 00:17:50.568]  I demand that you put pressure on them.
[00:17:50.568 --> 00:17:52.769]  I've never called for boycotts of Fox.
[00:17:52.769 --> 00:17:56.810]  I've actually said that we shouldn't let Media Matters try to bankrupt Glenn Beck.
[00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.792]  But at a certain point, we've got to use our financial power against them.
[00:18:00.792 --> 00:18:02.032]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:18:02.032 --> 00:18:05.814]  Do you as listeners have other ideas of what we can do about this?
[00:18:06.634 --> 00:18:10.679]  Enough is enough is enough is enough.
[00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:11.920]  They think you're weak-minded.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:18.267]  They think if they show you people booing Ron Paul, that you'll think, well, he's not popular, I won't get behind him.
[00:18:18.267 --> 00:18:26.516]  And they think you're so weak-minded that if they tell you he can't win, they can then cheat him at the electronic voting machine boxes in the primaries.
[00:18:26.516 --> 00:18:27.698]  They can defeat him coming up.
[00:18:28.697 --> 00:18:33.279]  They think they can create that mindset, well, I would vote for Ron Paul, but he can't win.
[00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:35.861]  He's winning the Gallup polls.
[00:18:35.861 --> 00:18:40.523]  Multiple polls, he gets first or second place behind Mitt Romney.
[00:18:40.523 --> 00:18:43.965]  Mitt Romney was a supporter of government-run healthcare.
[00:18:43.965 --> 00:18:50.909]  It's come out today that, of course, Haley Barber lobbied, when he was the head of the Republican Party, for total amnesty.
[00:18:50.909 --> 00:18:56.672]  I mean, if you want total amnesty in the North American Union open borders, if you want a George Bush-style Rockefeller Republican,
[00:18:57.572 --> 00:19:15.956]  If you want the SPP, if you want your guns taken, Bush supported the assault weapons ban, if you want the Wall Street looting, if you want the Federal Reserve to continue, then by all means support Newt Gingrich, support Mitt Romney, support the Haley-Barber style Republican Party.
[00:19:15.956 --> 00:19:24.378]  But if you want a true constitutionalist that reflects true conservative ideas and values, Ron Paul is the man.
[00:19:26.075 --> 00:19:30.014]  Ron Paul, ladies and gentlemen, is the answer.
[00:19:30.939 --> 00:19:39.961]  Now, he's the answer at the federal level, and if he runs and loses, we still win by him getting the word out and injecting sanity into those debates and telling people what's really happening.
[00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:42.761]  It sent shockwaves around the world three years ago.
[00:19:42.761 --> 00:19:46.002]  I'd say it'll be 20 times the effect conservatively this time.
[00:19:46.002 --> 00:19:46.742]  He must run.
[00:19:46.742 --> 00:19:49.302]  He will run unless something happens.
[00:19:49.302 --> 00:19:56.904]  But when we come back, I'm going to play you first the real audio and video of him getting a total standing ovation when he won Friday.
[00:19:59.674 --> 00:20:09.518]  The five main steps to great health are detoxification, an alkaline pH, elimination of infections, optimal hormone levels, and re-nutrification.
[00:20:09.518 --> 00:20:13.859]  When all these factors are brought into play, then your body is supported to create radiant health.
[00:20:13.859 --> 00:20:17.580]  Of all the nutrients needed by the body, protein plays a dominant role.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:22.982]  The type, quality, and adjustability of that protein plays a key role in how good you feel on a day-to-day basis.
[00:20:23.582 --> 00:20:29.747]  Of all the proteins that nature offers, one is the most digestible and offers the most benefits for the most people.
[00:20:29.747 --> 00:20:33.629]  It is unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[00:20:33.629 --> 00:20:38.553]  One World Whey is the first-ever unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[00:20:38.553 --> 00:20:41.815]  It is easily digested and comes in three delicious flavors.
[00:20:41.815 --> 00:20:48.020]  Whether you want better energy, better blood sugar, more endurance, or clearer thinking, One World Whey is a must for you to try.
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:48.180]  Call 888-4-4-4.
[00:20:50.681 --> 00:21:02.466]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:02.466 --> 00:21:04.746]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:04.746 --> 00:21:08.048]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:08.048 --> 00:21:13.169]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.169 --> 00:21:17.351]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:17.671 --> 00:21:20.012]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:22.893]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:22.893 --> 00:21:25.815]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:25.815 --> 00:21:33.418]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:33.757 --> 00:21:39.142]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.142 --> 00:21:41.984]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:41.984 --> 00:21:45.688]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:45.688 --> 00:21:46.769]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:46.769 --> 00:21:48.090]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.591]  Invisible Empire.

[00:22:01.229 --> 00:22:08.298]  If you are going through a financial rollercoaster because of your investment in stocks, bonds, and other paper assets, perhaps you're ready for a change.
[00:22:08.298 --> 00:22:11.501]  You have an opportunity to change your financial security.
[00:22:11.501 --> 00:22:15.386]  Get the stability and peace of mind you deserve by investing in precious metals.
[00:22:15.586 --> 00:22:20.348]  Gold and silver have been a form of wealth protection for over 5,000 years all over the world.
[00:22:20.348 --> 00:22:26.570]  If you have seen your hard-earned money lose value because of inflation, sliding dollar, etc., it's time you stop the bleeding.
[00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.271]  The answer to your problems is simple.
[00:22:28.271 --> 00:22:35.514]  Gold and silver will protect your assets and your purchasing power, physical possession of precious metals, IRA rollover, etc.

[00:22:41.576 --> 00:22:45.938]  Take action today when we are still accepting paper dollars for gold and silver.
[00:22:45.938 --> 00:22:47.219]  Ready for a change?
[00:22:47.219 --> 00:22:49.500]  Call Roger Raw at 1-800-686-2237 extension 178.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.561]  Again it's 1-800-686-2237 extension 178.
[00:22:50.561 --> 00:22:53.882]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[00:22:53.882 --> 00:22:57.204]  My name is Spann and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[00:23:07.017 --> 00:23:11.761]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[00:23:11.761 --> 00:23:13.683]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[00:23:13.683 --> 00:23:15.565]  It made me feel breathless.
[00:23:15.565 --> 00:23:20.008]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[00:23:20.008 --> 00:23:21.069]  Nothing did anything.
[00:23:21.069 --> 00:23:25.053]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[00:23:25.053 --> 00:23:29.176]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:29.176 --> 00:23:31.839]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[00:23:32.259 --> 00:23:37.284]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month had completely vanished.
[00:23:37.284 --> 00:23:40.086]  Usually you find a 30-day or 60-day guarantee.
[00:23:40.086 --> 00:23:44.891]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a lifetime 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.

[00:23:47.093 --> 00:23:47.333]  Call 866-295-5305.
[00:23:47.333 --> 00:23:48.234]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:24:14.007 --> 00:24:16.228]  Here's another example of what I'm talking about.
[00:24:16.228 --> 00:24:26.250]  Driving in this morning, listening to local radio, Genesis, on a local station, I heard the SRN radio news that they carry.
[00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.171]  And they talked about CPAC and didn't even mention Ron Paul, the winner.
[00:24:30.933 --> 00:24:41.716]  That's another way mainline Republicans, and that's what basically runs SRN, and I guess it's better than some of the other stuff we could carry, but I'm told Teddy should just produce his own news for stations.
[00:24:41.716 --> 00:24:43.497]  In fact, maybe I should just set that up in my office.
[00:24:43.497 --> 00:24:47.538]  We can outdo what they're doing any day with just dry, focused news.
[00:24:47.538 --> 00:24:55.060]  And you just hear the propaganda laced in there, where they take you as a listener as a moron, and they
[00:24:56.271 --> 00:24:56.951]  I don't know.
[00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:17.991]  Now, what Fox News did is even worse.
[00:25:17.991 --> 00:25:19.973]  That's deception by omission.
[00:25:19.973 --> 00:25:23.535]  Fox News showed a clip from last year, and that was a scandal too.
[00:25:23.535 --> 00:25:24.155]  It was all staged.
[00:25:24.155 --> 00:25:27.377]  They had a microphone in the little Mitt Romney contingent.
[00:25:27.377 --> 00:25:28.057]  He had lost.
[00:25:28.057 --> 00:25:29.218]  He was angry.
[00:25:29.218 --> 00:25:32.500]  And so Fox News cut to it with the microphone in the crowd.
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:39.964]  Show that you, with a directional mic, only heard those around it, so it sounded like Ron Paul got booed.
[00:25:39.964 --> 00:25:49.269]  This year, the cheering was so overwhelming for Ron Paul, they just didn't show you that, and they showed you last year with the same master of ceremonies.
[00:25:49.949 --> 00:25:55.654]  So we're first going to play you what actually happened last week when they announced Ron Paul as the winner.
[00:25:55.654 --> 00:25:58.117]  You'll hear the sustained total cheering.
[00:25:58.117 --> 00:26:00.559]  Then we're going to go back to the start of the video.
[00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:06.464]  If you want to see it all for yourself, it's Fox News caught in shocking dirty trick stunt against Ron Paul.
[00:26:07.185 --> 00:26:10.349]  And that's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:26:10.349 --> 00:26:14.353]  And this needs to be gotten out to all Fox News listeners and viewers.
[00:26:14.353 --> 00:26:23.583]  Show that pressure is put on Fox so they don't continue to engage in dirty tricks like this, not just against Ron Paul, but against the electorate and against their viewers.
[00:26:23.583 --> 00:26:25.205]  This is outrageous.
[00:26:25.205 --> 00:26:28.028]  So here's what really happened at CPAC.
[00:26:28.028 --> 00:26:28.409]  Here it is.
[00:26:30.726 --> 00:26:34.507]  It is the results of the presidential straw poll.
[00:26:34.507 --> 00:26:39.729]  And this year probably was one of the longer lists we've ever had.
[00:26:39.729 --> 00:26:43.670]  And we had a number of writing candidates, which I'll touch on when I show the results.
[00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:45.951]  And we asked this year, we asked it two ways.
[00:26:45.951 --> 00:26:49.072]  We asked it as a first choice and we asked it as a second choice.
[00:26:49.072 --> 00:26:51.953]  And I'll show the combination of both.
[00:26:51.953 --> 00:26:55.014]  And the next slide.
[00:26:55.014 --> 00:26:57.095]  The winner of the straw poll this year
[00:27:01.237 --> 00:27:02.198]  We can't even say Ron Paul, they're so loud.
[00:27:02.198 --> 00:27:02.538]  Standing ovation.
[00:27:02.538 --> 00:27:03.159]  This is what really happened.
[00:27:03.159 --> 00:27:03.399]  Last Friday.
[00:27:31.038 --> 00:27:32.759]  Chanting Ron Paul.
[00:27:32.759 --> 00:27:33.900]  Okay.
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:43.746]  This is what really happened.
[00:27:43.746 --> 00:27:51.851]  But Fox News won't let you see it.
[00:27:51.851 --> 00:27:54.433]  Because they know best for you.
[00:27:54.433 --> 00:27:55.414]  Okay.
[00:27:55.414 --> 00:27:58.536]  Congressman Ron Paul gets 30%.
[00:27:58.536 --> 00:28:00.177]  Former Massachusetts Governor.
[00:28:01.317 --> 00:28:06.500]  Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, gets 23%.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.081]  Hear the boos?
[00:28:09.081 --> 00:28:12.483]  And as you can see, there are a number of candidates.
[00:28:12.483 --> 00:28:13.063]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:28:13.712 --> 00:28:16.894]  So, you hear about half of it is booing for Mitt Romney.
[00:28:16.894 --> 00:28:19.075]  You can almost hear no booing for Ron Paul.
[00:28:19.075 --> 00:28:21.097]  You have the one Mitt Romney corner doing it.
[00:28:21.097 --> 00:28:28.661]  I guess Fox couldn't get a microphone snaked over to that area, right in the mouth of one of the Mitt Romney supporters to boo, to drown out everybody else.
[00:28:28.661 --> 00:28:32.764]  And so Fox just said, you know what, get Ron Paul on right after the announcement.
[00:28:32.764 --> 00:28:38.447]  They get Ron Paul on, and the Fox News host, we're going to come back from break and play this, says, hey, you got booed.
[00:28:38.447 --> 00:28:39.048]  What do you think of that?
[00:28:39.989 --> 00:28:44.411]  And they show the video from the year before.
[00:28:44.411 --> 00:28:45.131]  And what a difference.
[00:28:45.131 --> 00:28:48.112]  He only won by a few percentage points last year.
[00:28:48.112 --> 00:28:51.793]  He beat Romney by a whole bunch of points, as you just heard, this year.
[00:28:51.793 --> 00:28:57.556]  And you heard the deafening standing ovation.
[00:28:57.556 --> 00:29:01.017]  You can barely hear some boos from the Mitt Romney crowd.
[00:29:01.017 --> 00:29:05.999]  And Fox News, they just decided you don't get to hear it.
[00:29:06.579 --> 00:29:09.101]  You don't get to see it.
[00:29:09.101 --> 00:29:11.122]  They're going to engage in fraud.
[00:29:11.122 --> 00:29:13.103]  They're going to engage in a hoax.
[00:29:13.103 --> 00:29:15.205]  They're going to engage in lies.
[00:29:15.205 --> 00:29:24.611]  They're going to keep you from being able to actually hear what people had to say for Ron Paul.
[00:29:24.611 --> 00:29:26.572]  He also won the poll, of course.
[00:29:26.572 --> 00:29:31.176]  But remember how he kept winning the text votes in all the debates?
[00:29:31.176 --> 00:29:34.218]  And the media would then either ignore it or would say, oh, this is ridiculous.
[00:29:35.506 --> 00:29:39.228]  You see, Ron Paul was proven right two and a half, three years ago in that campaign.
[00:29:39.228 --> 00:29:41.370]  And the system is now very, very scared.
[00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:43.931]  We'll show you the fraud when we come back.
[00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:50.755]  Right here on the GCN Radio Network, GCNlive.com, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:54.678]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.678 --> 00:29:57.359]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.223 --> 00:30:16.722]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:30:16.722 --> 00:30:20.386]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:21.383 --> 00:30:34.146]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:30:34.146 --> 00:30:41.408]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:30:42.108 --> 00:30:52.477]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:30:52.477 --> 00:30:56.420]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.523]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:31:00.123 --> 00:31:04.664]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.664 --> 00:31:05.585]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.585 --> 00:31:09.006]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:09.006 --> 00:31:09.866]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.866 --> 00:31:14.768]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.768 --> 00:31:15.508]  It's true.
[00:31:15.508 --> 00:31:20.369]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.369 --> 00:31:21.210]  Number 3.
[00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:24.791]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.791 --> 00:31:28.472]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.692 --> 00:31:29.493]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.493 --> 00:31:32.255]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.255 --> 00:31:35.939]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.939 --> 00:31:36.720]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.863]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.863 --> 00:31:45.628]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.908 --> 00:31:50.090]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:51.870]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.111]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:31:59.932 --> 00:32:03.775]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:32:03.775 --> 00:32:08.059]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:12.702]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:32:12.702 --> 00:32:18.707]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:32:18.707 --> 00:32:25.793]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:32:28.485 --> 00:32:34.008]  I'm looking for America.
[00:32:34.008 --> 00:32:35.649]  We're American and be proud.
[00:32:35.649 --> 00:32:37.771]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:32:37.771 --> 00:32:42.874]  Land I left free in the home of the brave.
[00:32:42.874 --> 00:32:46.516]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:32:54.449 --> 00:33:02.250]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:08.271]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:08.271 --> 00:33:15.813]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.813 --> 00:33:18.853]  OK, so you just heard the audio.
[00:33:18.853 --> 00:33:23.234]  And if you're watching Prison Planet TV, the video heard and saw the video.
[00:33:24.275 --> 00:33:38.339]  Of what really happened last Friday when Ron Paul won the coveted CPAC poll, which Reagan won and catapulted him in in 79, and that so many other people that end up winning the Republican nomination have won as well.
[00:33:38.339 --> 00:33:43.060]  And last year, Fox said, well, the straw poll doesn't really count anymore.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:47.782]  And this year, they just lied and played an old tape saying Ron Paul got booed.
[00:33:48.562 --> 00:33:51.143]  That's what they think of you, and I'm going to play that in a moment.
[00:33:51.143 --> 00:33:56.804]  But, I mean, look, Fox News is pushing this hard, and so are all the other camp followers.
[00:33:56.804 --> 00:34:02.225]  Again, you know, Radio News that I mentioned earlier, that even this network carries.
[00:34:02.225 --> 00:34:03.365]  We don't produce it.
[00:34:03.365 --> 00:34:06.226]  Just mentioned the straw poll and didn't even mention Ron Paul the winner.
[00:34:06.226 --> 00:34:11.147]  It's like mentioning the Super Bowl right after it is over and not saying who won.
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.641]  This is what they think of you then.
[00:34:13.641 --> 00:34:20.686]  They say, disrespectful libertarians hijack CPAC poll and its mission.
[00:34:20.686 --> 00:34:34.697]  And they go on here to not even really clearly tell you that Ron Paul won, and then they demonize him and say that, well it's just a bunch of fluff, doesn't even make sense.
[00:34:34.697 --> 00:34:37.979]  It says, it is the libertarians in attendance that produce the free
[00:34:39.062 --> 00:34:43.565]  Pornographic calendar passed out to attendees in 2010.
[00:34:43.565 --> 00:34:46.487]  So somebody handed something out so they blame all libertarians.
[00:34:46.487 --> 00:34:58.175]  It is the libertarians in attendance who openly promote the inclusion of groups like GOP round largely as an attempt to silence groups who speak in strong opposition traditional moral values.
[00:34:58.175 --> 00:35:00.817]  So again, the idea is because somebody shows up
[00:35:02.039 --> 00:35:04.725]  Uh, and talks about something that's Ron Paul's fault.
[00:35:04.725 --> 00:35:10.037]  See how they, and the whole thing is just a giant demonization campaign.
[00:35:11.061 --> 00:35:15.362]  That the gays are going to get us if we vote for Ron Paul.
[00:35:15.362 --> 00:35:17.903]  It's not even one of Ron Paul's issues.
[00:35:17.903 --> 00:35:25.825]  And meanwhile, it's the Republicans' leadership at Bohemian Grove shipping in the male prostitutes.
[00:35:25.825 --> 00:35:27.306]  Who's reported on that?
[00:35:27.306 --> 00:35:32.507]  New York Daily News, New York Post, Vanity Fair.
[00:35:32.507 --> 00:35:35.788]  Just two years ago, a Vanity Fair reporter snuck in there and witnessed it all.
[00:35:36.698 --> 00:35:41.224]  He got arrested, but still, he's a reporter, so they couldn't erase his brain.
[00:35:41.224 --> 00:35:42.866]  All of what he saw was there.
[00:35:42.866 --> 00:35:45.630]  Spy Magazine, back in the 80s, reported on it.
[00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:46.691]  I mean, come on!
[00:35:46.691 --> 00:35:51.177]  Richard Nixon told Harper's Magazine that it's a giant homosexual orgy.
[00:35:52.078 --> 00:35:53.819]  So, come on, guys.
[00:35:53.819 --> 00:35:59.622]  Republicans are telling us that they're so afraid of the gays that are going to come out from under the table and get them.
[00:35:59.622 --> 00:36:07.946]  But meanwhile, we all know that the mainline rhinos, you basically have to be a homosexual to be a high-powered mainline Republican, and Ron Paul isn't.
[00:36:07.946 --> 00:36:09.507]  We all saw what happened with Barrett.
[00:36:10.627 --> 00:36:12.970]  They tell him it's a German TV interview.
[00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:16.653]  They tell him, please step in this room while we fix the lights.
[00:36:16.653 --> 00:36:21.778]  And Barack, playing the part of Bruno, starts stripping his clothes down.
[00:36:21.778 --> 00:36:24.481]  And Ron Paul shoves him out of the door and screams at him.
[00:36:24.481 --> 00:36:28.165]  He goes completely freaked out, running out of the room.
[00:36:28.165 --> 00:36:33.130]  Now, if it would have been one of your other mainline Republicans, it would have been a full-on sex scene with Bruno.
[00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:34.150]  No doubt.
[00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.531]  I mean, it'd have been boom!
[00:36:35.531 --> 00:36:37.611]  Absolute you-know-what going down.
[00:36:37.611 --> 00:36:38.732]  So they're mad at Ron Paul.
[00:36:38.732 --> 00:36:39.692]  He doesn't join the club.
[00:36:39.692 --> 00:36:42.293]  He doesn't go into airport bathrooms.
[00:36:42.293 --> 00:36:50.475]  He's not being found with dead interns like so many people that are big mainline Republicans.
[00:36:50.475 --> 00:36:54.456]  One of them is a host on MSNBC in the morning.
[00:36:54.456 --> 00:36:57.657]  But oh my gosh, they just want to protect us.
[00:36:57.657 --> 00:36:59.858]  They just want to protect us.
[00:36:59.858 --> 00:37:00.698]  And it goes on and on.
[00:37:00.698 --> 00:37:02.219]  So I already played for you
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:07.504]  The audio and video of what really happened last Friday.
[00:37:07.504 --> 00:37:09.827]  Imagine how dumb they think you are!
[00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:10.768]  It's on C-SPAN.
[00:37:10.768 --> 00:37:12.750]  It's live on other channels.
[00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:14.512]  And they have the dirty trick ready.
[00:37:14.512 --> 00:37:22.941]  They go back and get last year, which itself was a staged event, with the microphone into the Fox feed, shoved up in the Mitt Romney gaggle.
[00:37:26.319 --> 00:37:32.232]  That's kind of like the famous roar of then-presidential candidate Howard Dean back in 2000.
[00:37:36.054 --> 00:37:36.775]  What year was that election?
[00:37:36.775 --> 00:37:54.952]  Back in 2004, where he's got the, you know, the microphone that I guess they call it a cardioid projection, where it only picks up what's right on your mouth, and so he's yelling and roaring while everybody else is cheering, and it sounds like he's crazy, because all you hear is him roaring.
[00:37:57.085 --> 00:37:59.567]  And they spun all that like, oh look, he's a maniac.
[00:37:59.567 --> 00:38:00.368]  Well, it's the same thing.
[00:38:00.368 --> 00:38:20.286]  A year ago, a year and five days ago, at CPAC, this came out then, we wrote articles about it, ran a microphone over, they had it all staged, okay, when Ron Paul wins, which they already knew from inside baseball, the things run by the Republicans, was gonna happen, you guys cheer into the microphone when Mitt Romney, you know, gets up second, but when Ron Paul gets up, you boot.
[00:38:21.209 --> 00:38:24.352]  Well, I guess they couldn't pull that off this year.
[00:38:24.352 --> 00:38:38.143]  So, knowing it's the same guy that presented last year that presents this year, as he's done for over a decade at CPAC, they go ahead and say, well, it's the same background, same guy, let's go ahead and bait and switch.
[00:38:38.143 --> 00:38:43.247]  Our viewers are so stupid and so addled that they won't figure out what's happening.
[00:38:43.247 --> 00:38:43.488]  Okay.
[00:38:44.417 --> 00:38:51.639]  Let's go ahead now and play the hoax video from Fox News as they try to embarrass Ron Paul on air.
[00:38:51.639 --> 00:38:54.520]  Here it is.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.480]  This is the setup interview.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:01.241]  Came out of nowhere and he won the Republican straw poll.
[00:39:01.241 --> 00:39:06.523]  Ron Paul, named by conservatives as their favorite to run for president at CPAC.
[00:39:06.523 --> 00:39:07.843]  But reaction?
[00:39:07.843 --> 00:39:09.564]  Not exactly warm and fuzzy.
[00:39:09.564 --> 00:39:10.624]  Now for the deception.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:37.069]  The winner of this year's CPAC straw poll is Texas Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:39:40.723 --> 00:39:45.986]  In the end, he was the winner, probably not the reaction he was hoping for, when you name a favorite to run for the White House.
[00:39:45.986 --> 00:39:49.549]  Mixed applause and boos as Ron Paul was announced over the weekend.
[00:39:49.549 --> 00:39:53.751]  The fiery Texas Republican, no doubt unfazed by the reaction.
[00:39:53.751 --> 00:39:58.554]  He's live with me now from Capitol Hill, winner of that straw poll for the second year in a row.
[00:39:58.554 --> 00:39:59.755]  How you doing, sir?
[00:39:59.755 --> 00:40:00.655]  Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:40:00.655 --> 00:40:01.296]  I'm doing fine.
[00:40:01.296 --> 00:40:02.196]  Welcome back.
[00:40:02.196 --> 00:40:04.858]  I'm doing fine, thank you.
[00:40:04.858 --> 00:40:06.219]  Who was in the audience booing you?
[00:40:06.219 --> 00:40:07.920]  Did you get a name on the head?
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.321]  Did you get an ID on those people?
[00:40:09.961 --> 00:40:15.146]  No, I wasn't there, so I didn't watch that little ceremony at the end.
[00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:20.590]  But it tells you that people aren't unanimous on this cause of liberty.
[00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:23.613]  You know, I am very determined that liberty is the issue.
[00:40:23.613 --> 00:40:27.477]  And some people like to be taken care of more so than demanding their freedoms.
[00:40:30.006 --> 00:40:32.409]  So it's not about Ron Paul's issues.
[00:40:32.409 --> 00:40:34.251]  It's not about Ron Paul's ideas.
[00:40:34.251 --> 00:40:39.837]  It's not about him winning Gallup polls that are scientific, being in first or second place in multiple polls.
[00:40:39.837 --> 00:40:43.581]  It's not about him winning the coveted Straub poll two years in a row.
[00:40:43.581 --> 00:40:48.807]  It's not about staged boos last year and now no boos you can hear in standing ovation this year.
[00:40:49.861 --> 00:40:55.063]  It's all about he got booed, which itself is a fraud and is a lie.
[00:40:55.063 --> 00:41:03.785]  Now regardless of what you think of Ron Paul, whether you're Democrat, Republican, Independent, whatever the case may be, what should happen to Fox News?
[00:41:03.785 --> 00:41:05.266]  I mean, we should talk about it.
[00:41:05.266 --> 00:41:06.306]  We should say it's wrong.
[00:41:07.236 --> 00:41:09.097]  We should speak out against it.
[00:41:09.097 --> 00:41:11.638]  I mean, they crafted this.
[00:41:11.638 --> 00:41:14.160]  They aired this days after that announcement had been made.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.540]  They got this ready.
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.481]  They got Ron Paul ready for the show.
[00:41:17.481 --> 00:41:22.324]  And they knowingly lied to their viewers.
[00:41:22.324 --> 00:41:27.407]  And look, I know the media spins and lies by omission.
[00:41:27.407 --> 00:41:29.628]  Now, there is this year.
[00:41:30.646 --> 00:41:34.929]  There is the fellow announcing the winners this year.
[00:41:34.929 --> 00:41:42.294]  And you notice he's wearing a different shirt and does not have a lanyard around his neck.
[00:41:42.294 --> 00:41:46.657]  But the same background, the same American flag background they used last year is what they used this year.
[00:41:46.657 --> 00:41:50.180]  And then, again, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, you can see this.
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:54.083]  If not, go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and you can see the video for yourself.
[00:41:54.083 --> 00:41:57.205]  Fox caught in shocking dirty tricks done against Ron Paul.
[00:41:57.205 --> 00:41:58.046]  That was this year.
[00:41:59.286 --> 00:42:00.987]  And then there's last year.
[00:42:00.987 --> 00:42:08.372]  Little bit different shirt, little bit different jacket, and he's got a blue lanyard around his neck.
[00:42:08.372 --> 00:42:16.176]  So, what is Fox News gonna do caught trying to deceive their viewers?
[00:42:16.176 --> 00:42:17.897]  I mean, does that make people happy?
[00:42:17.897 --> 00:42:19.598]  Do you like that?
[00:42:19.598 --> 00:42:24.621]  We're gonna open the phones up, and I wanna get your take on this issue and all the other issues that I've already
[00:42:26.237 --> 00:42:27.938]  You know, basically skimmed over.
[00:42:27.938 --> 00:42:29.278]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:42:29.278 --> 00:42:30.799]  800-259-9231 will get you up and on the air.
[00:42:30.799 --> 00:42:36.201]  Then I'm gonna get into all of the other incredible news that we have here on Egypt, on the economy, on Bernie Madoff.
[00:42:46.425 --> 00:43:11.517]  On poison, toxic products, killing kids, on the internet, kill switch, alarms, privacy experts, USA Today, that is all coming up, but I'm asking you, the listeners, specifically, you can talk about whatever you want here, we don't screen your calls, it's wide open phones, for first time callers in this first hour, and then a little bit into the next hour, then it'll be wide open for everybody, but I mean, does this anger you?
[00:43:13.165 --> 00:43:17.648]  I mean, have we just gotten to the point where we just accept being manipulated and being deceived?
[00:43:17.648 --> 00:43:21.550]  It's one thing if media makes a mistake, or it's one thing if media gets their facts wrong sometimes.
[00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:22.210]  Nobody's perfect.
[00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:23.271]  Everybody does that.
[00:43:23.271 --> 00:43:28.914]  It's another thing that Fox has this long history of crafted hoaxes and deception.
[00:43:28.914 --> 00:43:33.576]  Just like Rachel Maddow got up with Rand Paul.
[00:43:33.576 --> 00:43:36.058]  He had about a two-second delay on the satellite.
[00:43:36.058 --> 00:43:38.199]  She said, are you for getting rid of the Civil Rights Act?
[00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:40.780]  And he said, yes, I can't hear you.
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:41.120]  Hold on.
[00:43:42.621 --> 00:43:44.382]  Uh, say it again?
[00:43:44.382 --> 00:43:46.683]  No, no, I'm not for getting rid of that.
[00:43:46.683 --> 00:43:54.787]  And they put a transcript out, cutting out the, yes, yes, now I can hear you, to, do you agree with getting rid of the Civil Rights Act?
[00:43:54.787 --> 00:43:56.748]  Yes, I do.
[00:43:56.748 --> 00:44:01.790]  When clearly, we played the video here, he said, hold on, I didn't hear you, yes, what was that?
[00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:03.991]  They say it again, uh, no, no, I'm not for getting rid of it.
[00:44:04.898 --> 00:44:06.559]  And they said he kidnapped a woman.
[00:44:06.559 --> 00:44:08.601]  They said he wasn't really a medical doctor.
[00:44:08.601 --> 00:44:10.442]  But see, that backfired on them.
[00:44:10.442 --> 00:44:14.125]  But see, Fox still has a lot of conservatives trusting them.
[00:44:14.125 --> 00:44:16.006]  MSNBC's lost their trust.
[00:44:16.006 --> 00:44:19.088]  That's why their biggest shows have half a million viewers.
[00:44:19.088 --> 00:44:21.570]  Some nights, maybe a million.
[00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:24.032]  Most of their shows, about a quarter million.
[00:44:24.032 --> 00:44:28.154]  I mean, a big radio station in a major city has that many listeners per hour.
[00:44:28.154 --> 00:44:29.135]  It's a joke.
[00:44:29.135 --> 00:44:29.996]  It's a fraud.
[00:44:29.996 --> 00:44:31.477]  It's a hoax.
[00:44:31.477 --> 00:44:31.597]  And
[00:44:33.134 --> 00:44:40.317]  We should, though, still be happy because the fact that Fox has to pose as patriots shows how far we've come.
[00:44:40.317 --> 00:44:54.862]  The fact that we forced them to cover world government, the fact that we forced them to cover SDRs and cashless grids, the fact that we've gone this far is amazing and is extremely, extremely, extremely exciting.
[00:44:54.862 --> 00:44:58.783]  Okay, let's go ahead now and take some calls here.
[00:44:58.783 --> 00:45:00.464]  Let's talk to Jason in Texas.
[00:45:00.464 --> 00:45:01.344]  Jason, you're on the air.
[00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:05.670]  Hello?
[00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.492]  Yes, Jason, can you turn your radio off?
[00:45:08.492 --> 00:45:11.013]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:11.013 --> 00:45:13.735]  I'm a big fan of yours, man.
[00:45:13.735 --> 00:45:17.277]  That really makes me very angry about the Ron Paul thing.
[00:45:17.277 --> 00:45:20.138]  I had a quick question I was going to ask you.
[00:45:20.138 --> 00:45:20.838]  Can you hear me?
[00:45:20.838 --> 00:45:23.680]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:30.463]  I live just north of you in Temple, Texas, and the snow that we got a while back, it seems like I'm the only one that noticed it.
[00:45:32.421 --> 00:45:42.639]  There was a red residue in the snow that covered every single vehicle and the local news was saying it was the rock salt they put down the road to melt the ice.
[00:45:43.188 --> 00:45:52.032]  But my truck was covered in snow in my backyard and it had that red film residue over it and I wanted to get a sample of it and get it tested but I don't have much money.
[00:45:52.032 --> 00:46:02.736]  Well, I mean, statistically, there is weather modification, there is bizarre chemical biological spraying, testing going on everywhere.
[00:46:03.636 --> 00:46:04.898]  All over the world, that's admitted.
[00:46:04.898 --> 00:46:07.821]  Most of it classified, but they admit the programs are going on.
[00:46:07.821 --> 00:46:16.070]  But routinely growing up in Texas, and it's the same all over the country, dust circles in the jet stream around the world.
[00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:17.672]  And there's the Mongolian desert.
[00:46:18.453 --> 00:46:18.593]  That's
[00:46:39.795 --> 00:46:43.219]  So that's probably, probably what that was.
[00:46:43.219 --> 00:46:48.623]  Some dust from maybe 100 miles away or maybe 5,000 miles away or maybe 10,000 miles away.
[00:46:48.623 --> 00:46:51.506]  It would have to be tested to ascertain that.
[00:46:51.506 --> 00:47:00.234]  But there's all sorts of university aircraft and studies that are done routinely where they'll send jet aircraft up to 30,000 feet, 50,000 feet or higher and the jets will fly
[00:47:04.478 --> 00:47:16.261]  And basically have a scoop on the front that picks things up to test for air quality, and they'll pick up stuff from volcanoes that were known to erupt from samples they got 100 years ago.
[00:47:16.261 --> 00:47:29.924]  They'll pick up bugs, spiders, pieces of moths, because if there's a tornado or a storm, sometimes bugs and cat hair, you name it, bird feathers, pieces of plastic,
[00:47:30.544 --> 00:47:36.025]  It gets blown up into the upper atmosphere and basically rides the winds.
[00:47:36.025 --> 00:47:38.786]  Jet streams can be going 200 miles an hour or more.
[00:47:38.786 --> 00:47:42.487]  So they just ride those winds sometimes for centuries.
[00:47:42.487 --> 00:47:44.808]  And so there's all sorts of stuff in the atmosphere.
[00:47:44.808 --> 00:47:46.608]  Does that answer your question?
[00:47:46.608 --> 00:47:46.988]  Yes, sir.
[00:47:46.988 --> 00:47:50.769]  I just had a quick theory real quick if I could share with you.
[00:47:50.769 --> 00:47:54.470]  I got that video you had of what in the world are they spraying.
[00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:57.131]  That's kind of what was making me wonder.
[00:47:58.482 --> 00:48:03.408]  I say they're putting that aluminum in the atmosphere with those planes.
[00:48:03.408 --> 00:48:16.343]  I really think that it has something to do with that HAARP system where it makes an electromagnetic field in the atmosphere where they can, you know, laser point those beams from the HAARP system.
[00:48:16.343 --> 00:48:17.104]  What do you think about that?
[00:48:20.236 --> 00:48:23.218]  Well, we know that HAARP is a whole bunch of different programs.
[00:48:23.218 --> 00:48:27.040]  Weather modification, over-the-horizon radar.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:39.167]  I mean, the similar HAARP system is now being put in in different Middle Eastern countries, and they just openly admit that they're using the ionization of the atmosphere with these big antenna arrays to manipulate the weather.
[00:48:39.167 --> 00:48:41.329]  So, yes, look, that's the problem.
[00:48:41.989 --> 00:48:44.812]  Alex, I wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[00:48:44.812 --> 00:48:46.454]  We need a thousand of you.
[00:48:46.454 --> 00:48:47.936]  The truth is so rare in America anymore.
[00:49:03.752 --> 00:49:10.814]  Well, I'm only trying to survive here, and tyranny's not a good place for myself or my family, so we're all in this together.
[00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:12.515]  But, I mean, thank you, sir.
[00:49:12.515 --> 00:49:17.557]  What do you think about the Ron Paul situation, the Fox News hoax?
[00:49:17.557 --> 00:49:19.358]  That's a no-no.
[00:49:19.358 --> 00:49:22.459]  Anyhow, I have two comments that I wanted to make.
[00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:32.002]  One is I don't quite understand why people do not go after the main family that runs all of this stuff in the first place.
[00:49:32.526 --> 00:49:59.279]  Let me tell you a little story that happened to me a couple years ago off the coast of Florida here is that me and a buddy were scuba diving and we were surrounded by about 16 or 17 big barracuda and they kept swimming around us and swimming around us and kept coming closer and you know finally Barry shot the biggest one and they ran off about 20 or 25
[00:50:00.885 --> 00:50:04.828]  Uh, yards, I guess, and, and started circling around.
[00:50:04.828 --> 00:50:11.332]  Chose another one that seemed to be about the, you know, about the bigger size.
[00:50:11.332 --> 00:50:16.016]  And, uh, and they started circling us again.
[00:50:16.016 --> 00:50:17.236]  Anyhow, we don't want to stay there.
[00:50:17.236 --> 00:50:18.357]  I want to hear the rest of your story.
[00:50:18.357 --> 00:50:19.238]  We got to go to break.
[00:50:19.238 --> 00:50:22.880]  But, um, obviously you were out spear gun fishing, man.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:25.022]  And you probably had already shot a fish.
[00:50:25.022 --> 00:50:26.603]  So they were smelling the blood or what happened?
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:40.411]  Well the bottom line is that we shot the biggest one the very first time and then they went back in a group and chose another leader and came up to us and this is what I don't quite understand.
[00:50:41.161 --> 00:50:42.322]  Well, they're a big part of it.
[00:50:42.322 --> 00:50:46.503]  You know what, let's talk about that when we come back on the other side with Wayne.
[00:50:46.503 --> 00:50:48.684]  Then we'll go to Aaron, Zach, Patrick, Jason and others.
[00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:04.014]  This is not a drill.
[00:51:04.014 --> 00:51:06.535]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:06.535 --> 00:51:08.436]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:51:08.436 --> 00:51:15.639]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:51:15.639 --> 00:51:20.041]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:51:20.041 --> 00:51:22.542]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques.
[00:51:22.642 --> 00:51:25.466]  Where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them.
[00:51:25.466 --> 00:51:27.409]  How to create the perfect hiding place.
[00:51:27.409 --> 00:51:30.553]  As well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:51:30.553 --> 00:51:32.196]  Under any circumstance.
[00:51:32.196 --> 00:51:39.046]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:51:39.386 --> 00:51:40.087]  But listen up.
[00:51:40.087 --> 00:51:46.331]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:51:46.331 --> 00:51:48.173]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:48.173 --> 00:51:50.354]  That's hideyourguns.com.

[00:52:01.698 --> 00:52:05.722]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.722 --> 00:52:08.965]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:08.965 --> 00:52:13.769]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:52:13.769 --> 00:52:20.155]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.155 --> 00:52:22.398]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:22.918 --> 00:52:23.238]  Tim Geithner?
[00:52:23.238 --> 00:52:23.478]  Bernanke?
[00:52:23.478 --> 00:52:24.099]  They're arsonists!
[00:52:24.099 --> 00:52:24.859]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:24.859 --> 00:52:26.540]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.826 --> 00:52:43.968]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:43.968 --> 00:52:49.113]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.113 --> 00:52:58.301]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:54:25.618 --> 00:54:27.419]  Sometimes I don't do them for a week or two.
[00:54:27.419 --> 00:54:30.159]  Sometimes I do one every day for a whole week.
[00:54:30.159 --> 00:54:35.721]  We put out Dick Cheney's stand down, dealing with a stand down order and how he's been confronted over that.
[00:54:35.721 --> 00:54:41.803]  It became the number one search term throughout the day and the evening, and I couldn't sleep last night at about 2.30 in the morning.
[00:54:42.963 --> 00:54:58.210]  And I woke up and went and it was still in the top 10 on both Hot Topics and Hot Searches, and I saw a whole bunch of big online publications picking up our story, the We Are Change video, and it really had a big effect.
[00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:02.232]  It isn't gonna save the world, but all of it together, with God's help, is.
[00:55:03.192 --> 00:55:08.457]  And so I want to do a top search term today, Fox News caught.
[00:55:08.457 --> 00:55:15.144]  If you put Fox News caught into a Google search engine and click web, it's already the top links.
[00:55:15.144 --> 00:55:18.447]  And so what this will do is people will wonder what Fox News has been caught in.
[00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:21.991]  You see, they've got to destroy Ron Paul.
[00:55:21.991 --> 00:55:27.596]  They don't like to just do these risky, out-in-the-open lies unless they're really desperate.
[00:55:27.596 --> 00:55:30.398]  And they can't have him winning the presidency.
[00:55:30.398 --> 00:55:37.144]  It's already going to be bad enough to have him in the debates if he runs, which I guarantee he's going to unless he has any health issues.
[00:55:37.144 --> 00:55:44.691]  And we've got to really pray for him because, just like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts said, he said, if Ron Paul continues to build like this, they may go after him.
[00:55:45.151 --> 00:55:47.893]  And Ron Paul said on this show he knows that's a real issue.
[00:55:47.893 --> 00:55:50.515]  So he's putting a lot on the line for us.
[00:55:50.515 --> 00:55:52.777]  We need to support him.
[00:55:52.777 --> 00:55:56.220]  And Rand Paul's now going after the Patriot Act like he promised to do.
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:57.201]  These are great men.
[00:55:57.201 --> 00:55:59.683]  A great father and son duo.
[00:55:59.683 --> 00:56:00.404]  And God love them.
[00:56:01.181 --> 00:56:06.222]  But let's make Fox News caught the number one search term.
[00:56:06.222 --> 00:56:07.923]  Victory goes to whoever wants it the most.
[00:56:07.923 --> 00:56:08.743]  So hit them.
[00:56:08.743 --> 00:56:09.283]  Hit them hard.
[00:56:09.283 --> 00:56:10.683]  Put those three words in.
[00:56:10.683 --> 00:56:12.564]  Fox News caught.
[00:56:12.564 --> 00:56:14.544]  C-A-U-G-H-T.
[00:56:14.544 --> 00:56:16.345]  Fox News caught.
[00:56:16.345 --> 00:56:19.426]  And let's get them to that article about them being caught running this dirty tricks campaign.
[00:56:19.426 --> 00:56:21.506]  They've been caught with their pants down.
[00:56:21.506 --> 00:56:26.007]  I don't have some vendetta against Fox or any of the mainstream media.
[00:56:26.007 --> 00:56:28.388]  I'm just here exposing their dirty tricks and it's got to be done.
[00:56:29.148 --> 00:56:31.551]  I wish that they do the right thing, but they're not.
[00:56:31.551 --> 00:56:32.613]  So Fox News caught.
[00:56:32.613 --> 00:56:33.935]  Get that into Google today.
[00:56:33.935 --> 00:56:40.964]  Now, I think you answered your own question, going back to the caller Wayne in Florida.
[00:56:40.964 --> 00:56:43.007]  Wayne, I think you answered your own question.
[00:56:43.007 --> 00:56:45.931]  Your buddy speargunned the big barracuda.
[00:56:47.244 --> 00:56:49.725]  And when barracudas come up around me, I just start chasing them.
[00:56:49.725 --> 00:56:57.868]  Because it's like if a dog runs up and tries to bite you and you run, it's going to go into its instincts and going to attack you.
[00:56:57.868 --> 00:57:05.151]  But if you stand your ground with a big dog, unless it's a police-trained attack dog, 99% of the time they're going to turn away.
[00:57:05.871 --> 00:57:13.337]  And I mean, I was just in the Caribbean a few months ago and had a four foot and about a three foot and a couple other barracudas come up.
[00:57:13.337 --> 00:57:14.058]  They were looking at me.
[00:57:14.058 --> 00:57:15.439]  I just started chasing them.
[00:57:15.439 --> 00:57:16.380]  Didn't even have a spear gun.
[00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:18.201]  And boy, they high-tailed it.
[00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:19.222]  They high-tailed it.
[00:57:19.222 --> 00:57:22.945]  Now, that's not the case with a great white shark.
[00:57:22.945 --> 00:57:25.287]  But with smaller predators, it is.
[00:57:25.287 --> 00:57:32.012]  Though generally, I've talked to and read some divers, they say if you do go towards a great white or a tiger shark,
[00:57:32.933 --> 00:57:35.976]  Then they don't think you're food if you act like a predator.
[00:57:35.976 --> 00:57:37.818]  But I'm not saying that's fail-safe.
[00:57:37.818 --> 00:57:40.720]  Now, I'm not for violence either.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:47.466]  I am for defending myself, and I am for politically exposing the Rothschilds, who are right at the top of the pyramid.
[00:57:47.466 --> 00:57:54.073]  But there were models of global government, models of empire, before the Rothschilds really got control in 1815.
[00:57:56.094 --> 00:58:03.720]  After they beat Napoleon, they ran that stock market crash system and then basically bought the stock market up for pennies on the pound.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:07.262]  And I cover that in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:58:08.891 --> 00:58:14.698]  And so, uh, you know, that's an important, uh, facet for everybody to, uh, look at.
[00:58:14.698 --> 00:58:15.179]  But you know what?
[00:58:15.179 --> 00:58:16.641]  I spent that five minutes on other issues.
[00:58:16.641 --> 00:58:17.082]  Stay there.
[00:58:17.082 --> 00:58:19.785]  I'm gonna finish up with you, Wayne, and I promise I'm gonna try to hurry through.
[00:58:19.785 --> 00:58:24.371]  Aaron, Zach, Patrick, Jason, and others, first-time callers, toll-free number to join us, 800-259-8255.
[00:58:27.254 --> 00:58:27.455]  9231.
[00:58:27.455 --> 00:58:30.958]  You know, the Rothschilds all fell off a cliff tomorrow.
[00:58:30.958 --> 00:58:33.380]  Other barracudas would just replace them.
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:35.682]  Other shark teeth would roll forward.
[00:58:35.682 --> 00:58:43.169]  It's ideas and taking our states and our countries back.
[00:58:43.169 --> 00:58:44.571]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.571 --> 00:58:47.674]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.842 --> 00:58:54.425]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:58:54.425 --> 00:58:55.567]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:58:55.567 --> 00:59:00.131]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:59:00.131 --> 00:59:06.076]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:59:06.076 --> 00:59:08.218]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:59:08.218 --> 00:59:10.901]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:59:11.241 --> 00:59:17.744]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[00:59:17.744 --> 00:59:19.945]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:59:19.945 --> 00:59:25.287]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:59:25.287 --> 00:59:30.569]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:59:30.569 --> 00:59:35.952]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:59:35.952 --> 00:59:38.893]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:59:39.133 --> 00:59:42.135]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:59:42.135 --> 00:59:42.936]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:59:42.936 --> 00:59:43.837]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:43.837 --> 00:59:45.558]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.236 --> 01:00:10.062]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.062 --> 01:00:11.664]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.664 --> 01:00:13.206]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.206 --> 01:00:17.390]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:21.455]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.196 --> 01:00:34.880]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, I'm going to premiere a little five-minute, eight-second video that Aaron Dykes and I put together.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.461]  Aaron did a great job putting it together.
[01:00:37.461 --> 01:00:40.382]  It tells basically the whole story in five minutes.
[01:00:40.382 --> 01:00:44.004]  The takedown of Hosni Mubarak coming up in about 30 minutes.
[01:00:44.004 --> 01:00:47.146]  Then Gerald Solente is joining us also popping in.
[01:00:47.146 --> 01:00:48.286]  That is Luke Hradowski.
[01:00:48.286 --> 01:00:53.609]  I want to continue with your calls and attempt, not that I ever succeed to hurry through them, but
[01:00:54.389 --> 01:01:06.055]  Wayne in Florida, if you just joined us, was telling a speargunning story about, I guess, snorkeling or scuba diving off the coast of Florida with a dozen or so big barracudas swarming around him.
[01:01:06.055 --> 01:01:08.576]  Probably smelled blood from fish they were spearing.
[01:01:08.576 --> 01:01:14.379]  And how they then shot one of the big ones and then the other ones went and regrouped and came back at him.
[01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:17.680]  He's saying, why don't we cut the head off the snake?
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.262]  Why don't we go after the ruling families of the globalists?
[01:01:21.262 --> 01:01:22.523]  That's a very dangerous game.
[01:01:23.732 --> 01:01:29.294]  And they've put a corrupt system in, and our own personal corruption has allowed it to happen.
[01:01:29.294 --> 01:01:40.377]  And so we need to take our counties, our cities, our states back, take our federal government back, go after the big central banks through the legal system once we have control of it, and restore the republic that way.
[01:01:40.377 --> 01:01:49.760]  It's very dangerous to just start talking about French Revolution-style stuff, because that almost always turns into a bloodbath for everybody.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.040]  Does that answer your question, Wayne?
[01:01:52.562 --> 01:01:53.563]  That's got most of it.
[01:01:53.563 --> 01:02:05.951]  I have just one more comment that'll take about two and a half minutes that I need to tell you because what we really do not have in this world is enough love.
[01:02:05.951 --> 01:02:11.195]  It's like David Icke always said, you know, if it's not right, don't do it.
[01:02:11.195 --> 01:02:17.119]  If it's not the truth, don't say it and only give love and never ever give negativity a second thought.
[01:02:17.119 --> 01:02:20.221]  But what I had to say will only take a couple of minutes here.
[01:02:21.585 --> 01:02:26.866]  Uh, depress my mind and depress my soul for I've got matters I'll always control.
[01:02:26.866 --> 01:02:30.147]  Feeling you this way and knowing it's not for me.
[01:02:30.147 --> 01:02:30.927]  Let me be me.
[01:02:30.927 --> 01:02:49.350]  So open your eyes and you can see just like the emotions you get when you take part in someone's heart, sopping up the hurt and pain, just like you've been torn apart, touching the agony and tasting emotions and knowing what was lost, but telling yourself what you must do regardless of all costs.
[01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:49.450]  So,
[01:02:50.063 --> 01:02:52.104]  Think of the times you felt the exact way.
[01:02:52.104 --> 01:02:56.086]  Who wondered how you really made it from day to day to day.
[01:02:56.086 --> 01:03:04.930]  Hoping it would work and keeping your mind looking forward and straight and telling yourself it's gonna work out because it's all within my fate.
[01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:10.633]  For positive thoughts, read beauty and laughter in the lives that exist.
[01:03:10.633 --> 01:03:14.675]  So keep yourself in the realm of motion and do nothing but persist.
[01:03:14.675 --> 01:03:15.836]  You can do it!
[01:03:15.836 --> 01:03:16.996]  You can do it!
[01:03:16.996 --> 01:03:18.537]  And the first thing you know you can
[01:03:19.292 --> 01:03:23.474]  Winning them all, and helping no one to fall, and that'll be our plan.
[01:03:23.474 --> 01:03:33.040]  So, talk to yourself once in a while, and feel the spirits of others, and let him breathe the good, good air before he really smothers.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:40.224]  For, it's not much to ask for people relating to persons in great need.
[01:03:40.224 --> 01:03:47.228]  And when we all understand these powers, oh Lord, what a beautiful world indeed!
[01:03:47.228 --> 01:03:48.309]  Amen.
[01:03:49.477 --> 01:03:51.198]  All right, brother, good to hear from you, Wayne.
[01:03:51.198 --> 01:03:54.060]  Very powerful information, spoken from the heart.
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:54.721]  Very touching.
[01:03:54.721 --> 01:03:56.142]  Thank you for sharing it with us.
[01:03:56.142 --> 01:03:56.902]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:03:56.902 --> 01:03:57.863]  Long segment coming up.
[01:03:57.863 --> 01:04:00.985]  Aaron, Zach, Patrick, Jason, we're gonna get to all of you.
[01:04:00.985 --> 01:04:04.668]  The toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:04:04.668 --> 01:04:12.433]  I just got some disturbing news, and it's going up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:12.433 --> 01:04:14.574]  You know that in the Mediterranean,
[01:04:16.015 --> 01:04:16.455]  U.S.
[01:04:16.455 --> 01:04:24.019]  warships have been massing also in and around the Suez Canal.
[01:04:24.019 --> 01:04:28.362]  Israel has said in the last three weeks that they are prepared for military action.
[01:04:28.362 --> 01:04:35.845]  The Marine Corps FAST teams are being deployed to in and around Egypt.
[01:04:35.845 --> 01:04:37.406]  And now we have this report.
[01:04:37.406 --> 01:04:42.589]  Israel says Iran warships to transit Suez for Syria.
[01:04:44.739 --> 01:04:48.685]  And Iranian warships are in the Mediterranean, a serious provocation.
[01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:54.554]  So we're going to be breaking down what could lead to a major conflict in the Middle East.
[01:04:54.554 --> 01:04:55.014]  Stay with us.
[01:05:04.702 --> 01:05:05.963]  Tyranny is here.
[01:05:05.963 --> 01:05:09.885]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:09.885 --> 01:05:12.127]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:12.127 --> 01:05:17.990]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:24.214]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:30.597]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:30.597 --> 01:05:34.798]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:05:34.798 --> 01:05:39.100]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:45.042]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:48.604]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:48.604 --> 01:05:50.565]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:50.565 --> 01:05:51.005]  It's here.

[01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:52.414]  Thank you!
[01:06:59.994 --> 01:07:04.538]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.538 --> 01:07:05.458]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.458 --> 01:07:08.881]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.881 --> 01:07:09.742]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.742 --> 01:07:14.625]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:15.386]  It's true.
[01:07:15.386 --> 01:07:20.250]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:21.070]  Number 3.
[01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:24.653]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.653 --> 01:07:28.356]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.556 --> 01:07:29.357]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.357 --> 01:07:32.119]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.119 --> 01:07:35.802]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:36.583]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.583 --> 01:07:40.727]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.727 --> 01:07:45.491]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.771 --> 01:07:49.954]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.954 --> 01:07:51.735]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.735 --> 01:07:53.976]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:53.976 --> 01:08:02.061]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:08:02.061 --> 01:08:08.705]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.705 --> 01:08:11.687]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.691 --> 01:08:22.057]  I told you folks that the West, the same corporate interests that have sacked our country, funded the Muslim extremists, funded the communists on record, you name it, to bring order out of chaos.
[01:08:43.051 --> 01:09:05.923]  Are trying to overthrow a swath of countries, not just Tunisia or Egypt, but Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Yemen, and obviously this is going to drive up oil prices, this is going to drive up food prices, this is going to drive up commodities, and only exacerbate those countries where the people are only making a few bucks a day on average, like Egypt.
[01:09:07.111 --> 01:09:11.435]  And now the media admits that they sent people in to overthrow Mubarak.
[01:09:11.435 --> 01:09:19.962]  And then right as he defiantly says, no, I won't step down, when Panetta, the head of the CIA, had said he was going to step down hours before.
[01:09:19.962 --> 01:09:23.505]  He magically has a stroke and disappears and no one knows where he is.
[01:09:23.505 --> 01:09:24.846]  Is he in a resort in Egypt?
[01:09:24.846 --> 01:09:26.307]  Is he in a resort in Israel?
[01:09:26.307 --> 01:09:27.588]  Did he go to Germany?
[01:09:27.588 --> 01:09:28.369]  Nobody knows.
[01:09:28.369 --> 01:09:29.530]  All these conflicting reports.
[01:09:29.530 --> 01:09:30.090]  Is he dead?
[01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:32.532]  Now we hear he's near death.
[01:09:32.532 --> 01:09:34.215]  Did he have a stroke?
[01:09:34.215 --> 01:09:36.738]  On and on and on and on.
[01:09:36.738 --> 01:09:38.902]  Such convenient timing.
[01:09:38.902 --> 01:09:40.624]  And now this happens.
[01:09:40.624 --> 01:09:41.145]  Bloomberg.
[01:09:42.285 --> 01:09:46.328]  Oil climbs as Israel says Iranian warships heading for Syria.
[01:09:46.328 --> 01:09:51.531]  It might be true, but we have a media that told us that Russia attacked Georgia on 888 in 2008.
[01:09:51.531 --> 01:09:55.493]  We have a media that says that people booed Ron Paul.
[01:09:55.493 --> 01:09:59.916]  They play fake video on Fox News saying he was booed at CPAC when he won.
[01:09:59.916 --> 01:10:01.217]  I mean, who knows if this is even true?
[01:10:02.179 --> 01:10:04.260]  But we'll find out in the next few hours.
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:06.700]  In fact, let's start checking foreign press.
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:28.528]  Let's check Press TV, the official Iranian government, it was Iranian government funded, but let's press, let's check Press TV and see if the Iranians are saying that they are indeed putting ships into that area, which are crawling with Israeli, NATO, and U.S.
[01:10:28.528 --> 01:10:28.828]  ships
[01:10:29.808 --> 01:10:35.055]  Oil climbs as Israel says Iranian warships heading for Syria.
[01:10:35.055 --> 01:10:47.610]  Crude rose after Israeli Foreign Minister Lieberman said two Iranian gunboats are planning to move through the Suez Canal to Syria, spurring concern that Middle Eastern oil shipments will be disrupted.
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:53.686]  And you're talking about 30 plus percent of the oil in the world, 10 percent of all commerce going through that.
[01:10:53.686 --> 01:10:57.310]  You've got the Marines deploying, you've got the Israeli singer on a war footing.
[01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:58.631]  This is crazy.
[01:10:58.631 --> 01:10:59.592]  Over two gunboats?
[01:11:00.754 --> 01:11:01.294]  A gunboat?
[01:11:01.294 --> 01:11:07.695]  Remember Dick Cheney wanted to have fake gunboats painted up like Iranian boats attack our own ships.
[01:11:07.695 --> 01:11:09.576]  That's now been confirmed.
[01:11:09.576 --> 01:11:13.636]  New York Magazine, the New Yorkers reported on that.
[01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.797]  So who knows if this is even true?
[01:11:15.797 --> 01:11:20.138]  Oil climbed as much as 1.9% after Lieberman called the move.
[01:11:20.138 --> 01:11:22.638]  He expects later today a provocation.
[01:11:22.638 --> 01:11:24.378]  Well, is it a provocation when U.S.
[01:11:24.378 --> 01:11:27.219]  and Israeli ships and submarines are right off the coast of Iran?
[01:11:28.302 --> 01:11:29.082]  I mean, come on.
[01:11:29.082 --> 01:11:31.223]  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
[01:11:31.223 --> 01:11:34.804]  Oil climbed as much as 1.9% after Lieberman called the move.
[01:11:34.804 --> 01:11:37.405]  He expects later today, oh, it hadn't happened yet.
[01:11:37.405 --> 01:11:38.686]  A provocation.
[01:11:38.686 --> 01:11:47.169]  The Associated Press reported the first ever protest against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi as demonstrations took place in Bahrain and Yemen.
[01:11:47.609 --> 01:11:57.239]  This is the latest addition to the Middle East risk premium, said Phil Flynn, vice president of research at PFG Best in Chicago.
[01:11:57.239 --> 01:12:03.106]  This is a knee-jerk reaction to the headlines that Iran is planning to send two warships through the Suez Canal.
[01:12:03.106 --> 01:12:04.747]  Crude oil for March delivery rose 81 cents.
[01:12:06.349 --> 01:12:06.669]  I think?
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:35.284]  To conduct a touch-up of $104.52, the highest inter-day price since September 25, 2008.
[01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:41.307]  The possible move of Iran comes five days after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down.
[01:12:41.307 --> 01:12:42.668]  You mean disappeared.
[01:12:42.668 --> 01:12:46.990]  Israeli leaders have voiced concern that Iran may exploit the period of transition.
[01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:50.531]  The tension in the Middle East is having a greater impact on the Brent market.
[01:12:50.531 --> 01:12:51.432]  And it goes on from there.
[01:12:53.417 --> 01:12:54.138]  Here's another one.
[01:12:54.138 --> 01:12:58.981]  Precious Metals Comet's gold hire on Iran warship news.
[01:12:58.981 --> 01:13:04.385]  Gold-edged hire on reports that Iran plans to send warships through the Suez Canal.
[01:13:04.385 --> 01:13:09.689]  Israel has described Iran's plans to send two warships to the key shipping thoroughfare as a provocation.
[01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:22.756]  Gold spiked up more than $6.30 to $1,380.40 per troy ounce, and it's still moving up as we read you this news report.
[01:13:22.756 --> 01:13:24.837]  Okay, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:13:24.837 --> 01:13:26.958]  We'll continue to watch this as it develops.
[01:13:26.958 --> 01:13:28.659]  Aaron in Nevada, you're on the air.
[01:13:28.659 --> 01:13:31.061]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:13:31.061 --> 01:13:33.922]  Alex, thank you very much for your work exposing fluoride.
[01:13:33.922 --> 01:13:37.724]  I have an internet radio show, it's called Go Nob.
[01:13:38.812 --> 01:13:45.438]  And, uh, we have a lot of great guests that are in the Modern Truth Movement, because there's a lot of people got their start on YouTube, etc.
[01:13:45.438 --> 01:13:51.483]  They're going forward and, uh, getting their own shows, and so, uh, you're a big influence on a lot of people.
[01:13:51.483 --> 01:14:00.431]  However, I must quarrel with your, uh, minimizing of the impact of the Rothschilds on this whole affair.
[01:14:00.431 --> 01:14:05.396]  They created Israel, and... Go ahead!
[01:14:06.872 --> 01:14:17.475]  So there could be no more efficient use of the motives of the Truth Movement to remove it, a la Ron Paul.
[01:14:17.475 --> 01:14:22.037]  He's going after their number one business model, which is the Federal Reserve.
[01:14:22.037 --> 01:14:24.498]  So I think we should stay with the focus on the Rothschilds.
[01:14:24.498 --> 01:14:26.338]  That's the only thing I have an argument with you.
[01:14:26.338 --> 01:14:27.979]  And I have one question for you.
[01:14:27.979 --> 01:14:28.859]  Do you have any
[01:14:29.957 --> 01:14:32.998]  Open, active Zionists working for you.
[01:14:32.998 --> 01:14:34.059]  Serious question.
[01:14:34.059 --> 01:14:34.959]  Do you or do you not?
[01:14:34.959 --> 01:14:37.480]  No, I appreciate your call.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:48.185]  Look, it's not fair to call up when we don't screen your calls and say that I'm not covering the Rothschilds.
[01:14:48.185 --> 01:14:58.969]  I mean, I've made multiple films that cover the fact that the Rothschilds have been one of the main drivers, and I said just 20 minutes ago, and that they're up at the very top of the pyramid.
[01:15:00.959 --> 01:15:02.463]  I mean, that's what I said on air.
[01:15:02.463 --> 01:15:08.398]  So, my whole issue is, there's like a movement, there's a bunch of different movements.
[01:15:09.383 --> 01:15:18.050]  To say it's the Masons that run it all, or it's the Zionists that run it all, or it's the Catholics that run it all, or a few other groups.
[01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:26.096]  And then people just get in these camps and fight with each other all day about who is the purest, who is the best, who has all the answers.
[01:15:26.096 --> 01:15:37.405]  And it's easy for people who've never really done a lot in the fight for liberty to kind of take a scalp or count coup and say, well, I've exposed Alex Jones
[01:15:39.027 --> 01:15:54.302]  And so I am this great leader when I just don't have respect for a lot of the people that criticize the corruption that goes on in Israel and Israel's involvement in the move for global government.
[01:15:54.302 --> 01:15:58.186]  Because a lot of them aren't intellectually honest.
[01:15:58.186 --> 01:16:00.147]  I mean, that's intellectually dishonest.
[01:16:01.167 --> 01:16:14.942]  When I say the Rothschilds are right up at the very top of the pyramid, but then I add that there's always been moves for empire, and that these models were already existing there, and so it's something that these elites are continually pushing for.
[01:16:14.942 --> 01:16:16.043]  I mean, it's crazy!
[01:16:18.595 --> 01:16:21.356]  But hey, more power to you.
[01:16:21.356 --> 01:16:26.879]  I mean, I constantly get emails saying, respond to the fact that you fired this radio host.
[01:16:26.879 --> 01:16:30.980]  And then I look it up and the radio host on Genesis quit and says they quit.
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:32.321]  It's just schizophrenic.
[01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:33.982]  I mean, it's delusional.
[01:16:33.982 --> 01:16:36.943]  Or respond to the fact that you work for ABC News.
[01:16:38.206 --> 01:16:56.438]  Genesis has leased over the years, I think, five different satellites, and you can call, if you have a gardening show, or a race car show, or a show about football, or a show about politics, you have to call, if you start a network, and you have to shop around and find out what receiver stations have and what they want, and then that's how you're on that.
[01:16:56.438 --> 01:17:04.523]  Kind of like, I have an iPhone, and it has AT&T service on it, but I don't work for AT&T, I don't work for Apple.
[01:17:05.373 --> 01:17:05.553]  I mean...
[01:17:21.764 --> 01:17:22.924]  It's crazy.
[01:17:22.924 --> 01:17:28.706]  I'm not an anti-Semite, though, and I think that's what people really have a problem with.
[01:17:28.706 --> 01:17:31.527]  And the white supremacists are pretty much Fed-run.
[01:17:31.527 --> 01:17:36.608]  It comes out constantly that their main leaders are Feds, like Hal Turner and many others.
[01:17:36.608 --> 01:17:40.849]  And it comes out in the news constantly that people leading Klan rallies are leading Nazi rallies.
[01:17:40.849 --> 01:17:42.950]  The Feds haven't infiltrated them.
[01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:44.130]  They set them up.
[01:17:45.017 --> 01:17:48.920]  To again, create balkanization and a call to restrict the First Amendment.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:57.368]  So here I am on air, taking your phone calls, and it becomes a debate about Alex Jones.
[01:17:57.368 --> 01:18:00.711]  I mean, here I am saying, I don't want war in the Middle East.
[01:18:00.711 --> 01:18:03.073]  Here I am saying, I want an end to the Patriot Act.
[01:18:03.073 --> 01:18:12.421]  Here I am supporting Ron Paul, trying to get rid of the Federal Reserve, and good fruits, good things,
[01:18:13.908 --> 01:18:16.009]  But there's a lot of things that enter into this.
[01:18:16.009 --> 01:18:17.930]  Mainly, it's jealousy.
[01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:22.491]  And I'm not even saying that with a collar.
[01:18:22.491 --> 01:18:24.432]  But with some people, it's jealousy.
[01:18:24.432 --> 01:18:26.793]  It's jealousy that I make powerful films.
[01:18:26.793 --> 01:18:28.774]  It's jealousy that I work so hard.
[01:18:28.774 --> 01:18:34.176]  It's jealousy that I've built a strong organization to get the word out.
[01:18:34.176 --> 01:18:37.657]  But more than just jealousy, people can't believe
[01:18:38.976 --> 01:18:41.918]  That someone could be effective.
[01:18:41.918 --> 01:18:44.359]  People can't believe that Ron Paul's real.
[01:18:44.359 --> 01:18:45.880]  Look at his voting record!
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:47.061]  It's stellar!
[01:18:47.061 --> 01:18:47.721]  It's perfect!
[01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:54.134]  People can't believe that I call Homeland Security live on air.
[01:18:54.134 --> 01:18:56.055]  That's not even that big of a deal.
[01:18:56.055 --> 01:18:58.518]  I don't even see that as courage.
[01:18:58.518 --> 01:19:00.740]  And they say, no, those are all fake calls when he calls Homeland Security.
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:02.562]  I mean, I dial the number on air.
[01:19:02.562 --> 01:19:03.202]  I call them.
[01:19:03.202 --> 01:19:04.704]  It's real.
[01:19:04.704 --> 01:19:05.985]  I interview big guests.
[01:19:05.985 --> 01:19:07.907]  People say, that wasn't Willie Nelson.
[01:19:07.907 --> 01:19:10.309]  You know, that wasn't Jesse Ventura.
[01:19:10.309 --> 01:19:11.870]  That wasn't George Norrie.
[01:19:12.671 --> 01:19:15.612]  And it's like, respond to the fake interview with George Norey.
[01:19:15.612 --> 01:19:16.992]  There's nothing to respond to.
[01:19:16.992 --> 01:19:17.772]  I can't respond.
[01:19:17.772 --> 01:19:22.413]  You're going to respond and admit that you are Bill Hicks.
[01:19:22.413 --> 01:19:24.694]  I'm not Bill Hicks.
[01:19:24.694 --> 01:19:31.755]  I mean, just because somebody says something on the internet does not make it true.
[01:19:31.755 --> 01:19:33.516]  It is the height of bizarreness.
[01:19:35.174 --> 01:19:36.254]  Believe in yourself.
[01:19:36.254 --> 01:19:38.435]  I mean, I try to be a platform.
[01:19:38.435 --> 01:19:41.036]  Other radio shows wouldn't let somebody call in and plug themselves.
[01:19:41.036 --> 01:19:42.636]  And I knew when the guy was doing it what was coming next.
[01:19:42.636 --> 01:19:46.877]  I could just tell by the satisfaction, by the slowness of the voice.
[01:19:46.877 --> 01:19:47.938]  I've heard it a million times.
[01:19:47.938 --> 01:19:58.361]  It's like, you got a lot of people out there who either they can't believe that people are real, or they don't have respect for themselves, or they're jealous.
[01:19:58.361 --> 01:19:59.321]  And hey, more power to you.
[01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:05.111]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:05.111 --> 01:20:09.613]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:09.613 --> 01:20:15.775]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:15.775 --> 01:20:18.196]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:18.196 --> 01:20:24.158]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:24.278 --> 01:20:27.702]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:27.702 --> 01:20:29.584]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:29.584 --> 01:20:31.767]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:31.767 --> 01:20:36.632]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:20:36.632 --> 01:20:37.453]  Guaranteed.
[01:20:37.453 --> 01:20:41.498]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[01:20:41.738 --> 01:20:49.783]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:20:49.783 --> 01:20:50.503]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.
[01:20:50.503 --> 01:20:51.344]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.
[01:21:00.524 --> 01:21:01.685]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:21:01.685 --> 01:21:08.669]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:21:08.669 --> 01:21:11.231]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:21:11.231 --> 01:21:16.634]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:21:16.634 --> 01:21:19.596]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:21:19.596 --> 01:21:21.657]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:21:21.917 --> 01:21:28.201]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:21:28.201 --> 01:21:31.583]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:21:31.583 --> 01:21:37.406]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:21:37.406 --> 01:21:39.047]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:21:39.047 --> 01:21:40.368]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:21:40.368 --> 01:21:43.049]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:21:43.049 --> 01:21:44.470]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:47.274]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[01:22:00.131 --> 01:22:06.797]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:06.797 --> 01:22:14.925]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:14.925 --> 01:22:22.772]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:23.072 --> 01:22:28.176]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:28.176 --> 01:22:33.401]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:33.401 --> 01:22:37.744]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:38.845]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:24:27.719 --> 01:24:30.722]  Okay, continuing to cover issues here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:30.722 --> 01:24:43.514]  The globalists want to divide us along different lines and have us just fight with each other all day like crabs in a bucket instead of focusing on the global banking cartel and removing the fractional reserve banking system.
[01:24:43.514 --> 01:24:45.596]  You can put whatever you want at the head of it.
[01:24:46.377 --> 01:24:54.981]  And have a voodoo doll of the Rothschilds or the Vatican or the Easter Bunny, and you can sit there and stab it, you know, in your bedroom all night.
[01:24:54.981 --> 01:24:55.862]  That's great.
[01:24:55.862 --> 01:24:58.783]  And beat your chest and say, I'm better than Alex Jones.
[01:24:58.783 --> 01:25:00.704]  You know, I talk about Jews all day.
[01:25:00.704 --> 01:25:02.285]  Good for you.
[01:25:02.285 --> 01:25:02.605]  Good.
[01:25:02.605 --> 01:25:04.046]  More power to you.
[01:25:04.046 --> 01:25:07.307]  I'm here to say I got my Bill of Rights and my Constitution.
[01:25:07.307 --> 01:25:10.589]  I want constitutional money and I want my country back.
[01:25:10.589 --> 01:25:14.691]  And if we just follow the Constitution, all of these corrupt interests won't be able to run our nation.
[01:25:15.131 --> 01:25:17.153]  Okay, it's that simple.
[01:25:17.153 --> 01:25:19.494]  Let's go ahead and talk to Zach in Illinois.
[01:25:19.494 --> 01:25:20.435]  Zach, you're on the air.
[01:25:20.435 --> 01:25:21.656]  Welcome.
[01:25:21.656 --> 01:25:25.038]  Hey, I'm actually from Texas, but first off, I want to thank you, Alex.
[01:25:25.038 --> 01:25:28.100]  Let me be clear, because I keep getting calls from different states behind him.
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:28.861]  You're in Texas.
[01:25:28.861 --> 01:25:30.702]  You're not in Illinois.
[01:25:30.702 --> 01:25:31.743]  Yeah, I'm in Texas.
[01:25:31.743 --> 01:25:35.545]  Okay, we're going to go back through the calls, and we're going to check those states there.
[01:25:35.545 --> 01:25:37.827]  Okay, Zach, go ahead.
[01:25:37.827 --> 01:25:41.550]  Okay, so I wanted to clarify something that you have been saying.
[01:25:42.597 --> 01:25:49.681]  Okay, so there was a congressional committee, and there were the head of the CIA, the head of the FBI, whatnot.
[01:25:49.681 --> 01:25:52.022]  They were being asked about terror threats.
[01:25:52.022 --> 01:25:55.924]  And a congressman asked Panetta on what Mubarak would do that day.
[01:25:55.924 --> 01:26:00.766]  And this was on Thursday, the day that Mubarak announced that he would be giving his power to the Vice President.
[01:26:00.766 --> 01:26:07.670]  So, Panetta, the director of the CIA, goes, well, we had gotten some documents on what he might do.
[01:26:08.618 --> 01:26:17.642]  We don't have anything on what he will do, but from my perspective, from what I know, I would say that he would give his powers to the Vice President, so on and so forth.
[01:26:17.642 --> 01:26:26.546]  So then I get on the news, all the main media, what he basically said, Mubarak, what Mubarak had said was that he's going to transfer his powers to the VP.
[01:26:26.546 --> 01:26:31.007]  So the CIA director knew beforehand exactly what Mubarak was going to do.
[01:26:31.007 --> 01:26:34.709]  I'm sure that's not a surprise to you, but also I had a suggestion.
[01:26:35.535 --> 01:26:41.987]  For all these people who come on here bashing you, Alex, I mean, I'm a huge listener.
[01:26:41.987 --> 01:26:43.109]  I think you're doing good.
[01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:45.574]  I don't know how you can possibly be corrupt when you talk about
[01:26:46.458 --> 01:26:48.219]  I don't care.
[01:26:48.219 --> 01:26:49.780]  Let's just say I'm evil.
[01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:54.663]  I'm not, but let's just say I'm corrupt and as wicked as Beelzebub himself.
[01:26:54.663 --> 01:26:57.524]  Okay, let's move on from Alex Jones.
[01:26:57.524 --> 01:27:01.106]  Let's take back our states, take back our counties.
[01:27:01.106 --> 01:27:02.507]  People are waking up.
[01:27:02.507 --> 01:27:07.469]  Let's not always turn it around and turn it into something about Alex Jones.
[01:27:07.469 --> 01:27:09.691]  That's what losers do.
[01:27:09.691 --> 01:27:11.712]  All they do is end fight with each other.
[01:27:12.612 --> 01:27:12.832]  Hello Alex.
[01:27:37.335 --> 01:27:43.599]  I want to say one thing about Ron Paul and that straw poll is how do you get 30% such a big lead and get booed?
[01:27:43.599 --> 01:27:45.080]  It just doesn't make sense to me.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:46.621]  No, he didn't get booed.
[01:27:46.621 --> 01:27:47.762]  It was fake.
[01:27:47.762 --> 01:27:49.203]  They admit it was fake.
[01:27:49.203 --> 01:27:54.606]  It's unbelievable that Fox, for those that just joined us, let me just recap it since you brought it up.
[01:27:54.606 --> 01:27:56.347]  Thank God a listener actually brought up a real issue.
[01:27:58.294 --> 01:28:05.180]  Ron Paul last year won the straw poll and Mitt Romney's people were all together in one area.
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:13.067]  Fox News, this came out the time, had a microphone amongst them to make the booing overpower the thousands of people that were cheering.
[01:28:13.067 --> 01:28:15.450]  This year it didn't work that way.
[01:28:15.450 --> 01:28:21.935]  Overwhelming standing ovation throughout the entire, I mean you hear it, it's all over the crowd, it's not coming from one side.
[01:28:21.935 --> 01:28:22.976]  Ron Paul won
[01:28:24.292 --> 01:28:29.215]  I think it's great that they did that, and we get a chance to expose them for the neocons that they really are.
[01:28:53.365 --> 01:28:56.347]  We get to get it out there, word out, and wake some more people up.
[01:28:56.347 --> 01:28:57.387]  That's what it's all about.
[01:28:57.387 --> 01:29:00.949]  I want to thank you again, Alex, and I'll listen to your comment.
[01:29:00.949 --> 01:29:03.651]  Well, let me ask you this, Patrick.
[01:29:03.651 --> 01:29:04.431]  Let me ask you this.
[01:29:04.431 --> 01:29:08.033]  Why do you think Fox has got so much hubris?
[01:29:08.033 --> 01:29:12.715]  I mean, why are they so arrogant to think that they could get away with this?
[01:29:12.715 --> 01:29:15.297]  Because they got away with it for so long.
[01:29:15.297 --> 01:29:18.558]  I mean, they've done it over and over again for, what, 30 years, 60 years.
[01:29:20.183 --> 01:29:26.487]  And people are starting to wake up and see through their rhetoric, and they can't figure it out yet.
[01:29:26.487 --> 01:29:28.969]  Eventually they will, but... Yeah.
[01:29:28.969 --> 01:29:30.610]  ...or they're just arrogant and they never will.
[01:29:30.610 --> 01:29:31.631]  Great points, Patrick.
[01:29:31.631 --> 01:29:32.831]  Good having you on board.
[01:29:32.831 --> 01:29:42.078]  Yeah, what happened is, they did the same thing that Rachel Maddow, that Mr. Maddow, did to Rand Paul.
[01:29:42.078 --> 01:29:44.699]  The same type of hoax.
[01:29:44.699 --> 01:29:47.521]  I mean, are we going to let them get away with this at Fox News?
[01:29:47.521 --> 01:29:48.562]  We'll be right back with more Your Calls.
[01:29:51.004 --> 01:29:54.931]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.931 --> 01:29:57.616]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.996 --> 01:30:04.579]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:30:04.579 --> 01:30:05.880]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:10.284]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:30:10.284 --> 01:30:16.230]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:30:16.230 --> 01:30:18.371]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:30:18.371 --> 01:30:21.054]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:30:21.394 --> 01:30:27.898]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:30:27.898 --> 01:30:30.099]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:30:30.099 --> 01:30:35.442]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:30:35.442 --> 01:30:40.724]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:30:40.724 --> 01:30:46.107]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:49.049]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:30:49.289 --> 01:30:52.291]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:30:52.291 --> 01:30:53.071]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:30:53.071 --> 01:30:53.651]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:53.651 --> 01:30:57.053]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:57.053 --> 01:30:58.774]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:31:11.021 --> 01:31:16.405]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:31:16.405 --> 01:31:19.447]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:31:19.447 --> 01:31:21.769]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:31:21.769 --> 01:31:28.034]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:31:28.034 --> 01:31:31.396]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:31:31.396 --> 01:31:37.181]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:31:37.181 --> 01:31:38.822]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:31:38.822 --> 01:31:39.963]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:31:40.103 --> 01:31:42.786]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:31:42.786 --> 01:31:47.011]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:31:47.011 --> 01:31:51.636]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:31:51.636 --> 01:31:54.239]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:32:01.957 --> 01:32:05.918]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:05.918 --> 01:32:14.779]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:19.420]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:30.222]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:30.862 --> 01:32:40.385]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.385 --> 01:32:45.807]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:45.807 --> 01:32:53.290]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:56.051]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:33:02.085 --> 01:33:03.326]  In constant sorrow, he's there
[01:33:29.752 --> 01:33:31.353]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:31.353 --> 01:33:32.594]  to 2 p.m., we're here live.
[01:33:32.594 --> 01:33:46.221]  Gerald Cilente coming up, as well as Luke Radowski, founder of We Are Change, confronted Dick Cheney and brought up the 9-11 stand-down order that the Secretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta, talked about in congressional testimony.
[01:33:46.221 --> 01:33:51.885]  He's done at least four or five interviews with We Are Change himself, Mr. Panetta, confirming that Cheney lied
[01:33:52.765 --> 01:33:57.086]  About saying that he got in the bunker 45 minutes later than he actually had.
[01:33:57.086 --> 01:33:59.407]  And Cheney got caught lying in Congress.
[01:33:59.407 --> 01:34:02.487]  And in that bunker, he ordered the stand-down.
[01:34:02.487 --> 01:34:05.948]  And thanks to you getting the word out on that yesterday, it's had a huge effect.
[01:34:05.948 --> 01:34:07.589]  We're about action.
[01:34:07.589 --> 01:34:09.589]  A little less talk, a little more action.
[01:34:09.589 --> 01:34:16.871]  We're here to talk about the issues and the problems, and then we're here to get Americans and people around the world to check out the information we cover.
[01:34:17.915 --> 01:34:21.200]  for themselves and then to take action with that information.
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:33.196]  Now, before I go, back to your calls and then to this premiere of this five-minute special video we put together last night, the takedown of Hosni Mubarak that we're going to premiere here in just a moment.
[01:34:34.093 --> 01:34:38.654]  But before we go any further, we are listener-supported.
[01:34:38.654 --> 01:34:59.819]  And you support us by purchasing the t-shirts, the ball caps that get the word out, that are walking billboards for the truth, that'll help you meet like-minded people, the V for Victory, Resistance is Victory shirts, the Draft Ron Paul 2012 shirts, the What in the World Are They Spring DVD, Covering the Kim Trails, Fall of the Republic, Burmese's excellent film I produced, Invisible Empire,
[01:35:00.399 --> 01:35:00.739]  I don't think so.
[01:35:17.105 --> 01:35:24.349]  When you buy the books and videos and materials, you're voting with your dollars to support this broadcast so we can continue and expand.
[01:35:24.349 --> 01:35:26.210]  The TV studio's almost done.
[01:35:26.210 --> 01:35:28.871]  Now we're having to make the intros and outros and develop it.
[01:35:28.871 --> 01:35:36.295]  I'm doing all this while I'm making films, doing the radio show, doing radio interviews, working on major stories, and I'm glad to do it.
[01:35:36.295 --> 01:35:40.858]  But we couldn't do it without your support, so I want to thank all of you that have supported us.
[01:35:40.858 --> 01:35:44.820]  You can also, for $5.95 a month, that's like 15 cents a day, Prison Planet,
[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:46.581]  We're good to go.
[01:36:03.951 --> 01:36:04.011]  The
[01:36:22.773 --> 01:36:25.494]  I should be glad I'm just being lied about and demonized.
[01:36:25.494 --> 01:36:26.975]  It's better than a bullet in the head.
[01:36:26.975 --> 01:36:31.377]  It's better than them giving me a heart attack, and that may be in store, but I'm committed to this.
[01:36:31.377 --> 01:36:35.519]  What do pilots call it when you've run out of runway and you're either gonna crash or you're gonna take off?
[01:36:35.519 --> 01:36:40.861]  They call it V2, and I reached the point of no return, or V2, more than a decade ago.
[01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:42.322]  I'm going all the way.
[01:36:42.322 --> 01:36:43.123]  I'm not stopping.
[01:36:43.123 --> 01:36:48.265]  The stakes are too high, and God is on our side, and I pray for divine providence in this fight against tyranny.
[01:36:48.265 --> 01:36:49.826]  Now, I'm gonna give each one of these callers
[01:36:50.646 --> 01:36:52.367]  Alex, I'm so grateful to talk to you and your audience.
[01:36:52.367 --> 01:36:55.008]  I woke up a year ago and I'm just excited to be on the phone with you.
[01:36:55.008 --> 01:36:56.708]  First of all, the CIA backed Google.
[01:36:56.708 --> 01:36:59.069]  The CEO came out and said he's very, very proud of that exec.
[01:37:17.782 --> 01:37:20.786]  Who organized the protests in Egypt?
[01:37:36.884 --> 01:37:40.887]  So, basically, you're searching the web using NSA keyword technology.
[01:37:40.887 --> 01:37:42.829]  That's the backbone of Google's system.
[01:37:42.829 --> 01:37:44.850]  They helped run the revolution.
[01:37:44.850 --> 01:37:48.933]  It's all Zbigniew Brzezinski, David Rockefeller type operation.
[01:37:48.933 --> 01:37:50.655]  And it's there in plain view.
[01:37:50.655 --> 01:37:51.475]  Go ahead.
[01:37:51.475 --> 01:37:52.036]  Amen.
[01:37:52.036 --> 01:37:53.997]  You know, first of all, I want to say, we're Americans.
[01:37:53.997 --> 01:37:54.758]  Okay?
[01:37:54.758 --> 01:37:57.139]  You know, don't let your eyes refuse to see.
[01:37:57.139 --> 01:37:58.821]  Don't let your ears refuse to hear.
[01:37:58.821 --> 01:38:01.643]  And don't let your voice refuse to be heard.
[01:38:01.643 --> 01:38:03.504]  I think Americans need to step up.
[01:38:03.504 --> 01:38:04.285]  We need to just...
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.001]  Wake our neighbors up.
[01:38:06.001 --> 01:38:07.783]  Wake up our communities.
[01:38:07.783 --> 01:38:12.528]  Email or buy the Constitution for your friends, your neighbors, your sons, your daughters.
[01:38:12.528 --> 01:38:15.130]  Wake them up to the Constitution of the United States of America.
[01:38:15.130 --> 01:38:16.792]  Let's back up Ron Paul.
[01:38:16.792 --> 01:38:20.155]  Let's stop voting for career politicians.
[01:38:20.155 --> 01:38:24.179]  I'm glad Lieberman and Dodd are getting out of Connecticut.
[01:38:24.179 --> 01:38:25.280]  They're sinking us.
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:28.884]  We just voted for Governor Malloy who's raising our taxes.
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:37.902]  Um, you know, there's so much I can talk to you about, you know, but the funny thing is Obama yesterday mentioned that Bush was inspiring citizens to become points of light.
[01:38:37.902 --> 01:38:40.842]  You know, that sounds like Illuminati type of phrases to me.
[01:38:40.842 --> 01:38:46.443]  You know, he said a thousand points of light, which is an Illuminati term.
[01:38:46.443 --> 01:38:47.464]  You're absolutely right.
[01:38:47.464 --> 01:38:48.724]  Anything else?
[01:38:48.724 --> 01:38:51.444]  I just want to say, America, wake up again.
[01:38:51.444 --> 01:38:53.225]  Don't let your eyes refuse to see.
[01:38:53.225 --> 01:38:55.165]  Don't let your ears refuse to hear.
[01:38:55.165 --> 01:38:57.486]  And don't let your voices be refused to be heard.
[01:38:57.486 --> 01:38:59.026]  We all need to stand up together.
[01:38:59.648 --> 01:39:00.730]  Work as Americans.
[01:39:00.730 --> 01:39:01.492]  We are America.
[01:39:01.492 --> 01:39:03.055]  Let's bring it back, Alex.
[01:39:03.055 --> 01:39:04.618]  I'm so proud of you.
[01:39:04.618 --> 01:39:06.481]  I'm proud of your listeners.
[01:39:06.481 --> 01:39:10.990]  Let's keep the campaign going and, you know, I'm just proud to be an American.
[01:39:10.990 --> 01:39:12.112]  Let's just bring it back, guys.
[01:39:12.501 --> 01:39:13.241]  Absolutely.
[01:39:13.241 --> 01:39:15.202]  Look at the awakening that's happening.
[01:39:15.202 --> 01:39:17.942]  Look at how far we've come together.
[01:39:17.942 --> 01:39:27.804]  And talking about this V for Victory campaign, the Answer to 1984, 1776 campaign, it is so huge what is happening with that.
[01:39:27.804 --> 01:39:29.244]  It is just unbelievable.
[01:39:29.244 --> 01:39:30.985]  This is the biggest response we've ever had.
[01:39:30.985 --> 01:39:35.526]  And I see all these incredible videos of people out there involved in activism.
[01:39:35.526 --> 01:39:36.646]  I salute all of you.
[01:39:36.646 --> 01:39:39.207]  It is so incredible to behold.
[01:39:39.207 --> 01:39:41.207]  Carissa in New Mexico, you're on the air.
[01:39:42.536 --> 01:39:48.060]  I've been listening for about two months, and you really have a powerful insight into how the world works.
[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:55.485]  I wanted to tell you about something you probably already know, but it's a powerful way to describe it, which is a concept for physics called Maxwell's Demon.
[01:39:55.485 --> 01:40:08.554]  And it's a way to describe the second law of thermodynamics that Maxwell came up with, and it basically is a hypothetical system that explains that for heat to flow from
[01:40:09.835 --> 01:40:33.426]  Cold to hot, you'd have to have a hypothetical demon controlling, interrogating each molecule that goes one way and the other, and I think this is how the globalists can forge into new areas they're not in yet, where there may be places like court decisions or committees reviewing proposals and so forth, where subjectivity comes into play, and then it's only in those subjective points where
[01:40:34.199 --> 01:40:34.679]  I think so.
[01:40:48.590 --> 01:41:03.442]  And make it look like things are proceeding by law and order, but they're really not, and they're really only going... Well, the globalists study how humans operate and how civilizations develop, and they know how to deploy themselves at key junctures, and by controlling the issuance of currency and credit...
[01:41:04.735 --> 01:41:16.541]  They're able to take over the entire planet because they issue the symbol of energy, the symbol of food, the symbol of substance, and what sustains people.
[01:41:16.541 --> 01:41:22.724]  And so through the issuance of fiat currency and credit, they take over the world.
[01:41:22.724 --> 01:41:25.305]  Great points, I appreciate your call.
[01:41:25.305 --> 01:41:28.606]  Let's talk to Scott in Washington.
[01:41:28.606 --> 01:41:29.427]  Scott, you're on the air.
[01:41:30.504 --> 01:41:43.534]  Yeah Alex, I wanted to talk a little bit about this thing that they're trying to run with this healthcare hoax as in the light of the last decision, but I wanted to ask you something real quick before I get into that.
[01:41:43.534 --> 01:41:57.826]  You had mentioned back in December something about you had wanted to get Mike Revell on your show in light of a new 9-11 investigation and I don't know whether or not you were able to do that, but I had sent to both your show tips and your
[01:41:58.917 --> 01:42:01.038]  I'm having one of those forgetful moments.
[01:42:01.038 --> 01:42:01.938]  The name rings a bell.
[01:42:01.938 --> 01:42:02.979]  Isn't he the liberal talk show host?
[01:42:02.979 --> 01:42:04.339]  I thought you were saying Ravel.
[01:42:04.339 --> 01:42:06.980]  You're talking about former Senator Gravel.
[01:42:20.697 --> 01:42:21.498]  Yes.
[01:42:21.498 --> 01:42:23.239]  Absolutely, I know who he is.
[01:42:23.239 --> 01:42:26.842]  That's why I couldn't pull up who it was because I was hearing you wrong.
[01:42:26.842 --> 01:42:36.750]  Yes, I want to get Senator Gravel on because he's very boldly come out and talked about 9-11 being an inside job and it's very, very exciting.
[01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:42.715]  Yeah, he does want to come on because he did send me his new contact information to forward to you and I had sent it to
[01:42:43.716 --> 01:42:46.137]  Uh, show tips on December 29th.
[01:42:46.137 --> 01:42:47.157]  I don't know if you got it.
[01:42:47.157 --> 01:42:49.058]  Yeah, some of that stuff gets lost in the mix.
[01:42:49.058 --> 01:42:56.420]  Why don't you, why don't you, uh, you know, I'm going to put you on hold, but just please don't send us a bunch of spam because it gets filled up.
[01:42:56.420 --> 01:43:00.221]  I'm gonna give you my producer's email and you can send us that new info.
[01:43:00.221 --> 01:43:01.322]  I really appreciate it.
[01:43:01.322 --> 01:43:02.642]  Anything else, Scott?
[01:43:02.642 --> 01:43:08.724]  Yeah, I just wanted to bring up a real quickly about this healthcare, the new hoax that they're trying to run around.
[01:43:08.724 --> 01:43:11.965]  And especially, and I've heard Tom Hartman doing this, trying to say that,
[01:43:12.389 --> 01:43:36.381]  There's nowhere in the Constitution where a federal judge or the Supreme Court has a right to overturn a law that's made if it's constitutional, and then trying to quote Article 3, Section 2 of the Constitution, which is absolutely bull, because they think that nobody is actually going to go and check it out for themselves, and then when you actually read it, it doesn't say what they're trying to allege that they're saying.
[01:43:37.006 --> 01:43:39.248]  That's just another hoax that they're now trying to run.
[01:43:57.384 --> 01:43:59.966]  They can make you buy a Maytag dishwasher.
[01:43:59.966 --> 01:44:04.189]  They can make you buy, you know, diamonds from the local diamond shop.
[01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:06.070]  They can make you eat broccoli.
[01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:08.592]  I mean, it's indentured servitude.
[01:44:08.592 --> 01:44:12.554]  It's a form of enslavement where they don't put you on a plantation.
[01:44:12.554 --> 01:44:16.197]  They just make you buy things from them.
[01:44:16.197 --> 01:44:22.341]  And you're absolutely right that courts are there to overturn laws that are unconstitutional.
[01:44:22.341 --> 01:44:24.482]  I appreciate your points on that.
[01:44:24.482 --> 01:44:26.964]  I'm going to go ahead now
[01:44:27.584 --> 01:44:35.506]  And get into this Hosni Mubarak situation, then I'll come back and go to Brian, Charles, David, Matt, and others.
[01:44:35.506 --> 01:44:45.849]  If you go to Infowars.com, you can see the second story in the featured news area.
[01:44:45.849 --> 01:44:49.851]  It's titled, The Takedown of Hosni Mubarak.
[01:44:49.851 --> 01:44:54.232]  Why has the media left untouched the mystery of Mubarak's reported coma
[01:44:54.972 --> 01:44:57.693]  Coinciding with his sudden departure.
[01:44:57.693 --> 01:45:04.014]  He refuses to step down, and then magically disappears, and we hear he has stepped down.
[01:45:04.014 --> 01:45:05.875]  That's a classic coup.
[01:45:05.875 --> 01:45:10.556]  And I'm no fan of Hosni Mubarak, but what does this say to other dictators the globalists control?
[01:45:10.556 --> 01:45:11.296]  What does this say?
[01:45:11.296 --> 01:45:19.278]  I mean, it shows how ruthless and backstabbing these people are, and now they're putting in the same military junta that was in control before.
[01:45:20.387 --> 01:45:23.788]  And they're trying to overthrow other countries in the Middle East, to destabilize things.
[01:45:23.788 --> 01:45:26.329]  And look at Iran now with the reported warships.
[01:45:26.329 --> 01:45:27.669]  This is escalating.
[01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:33.891]  This is a strategy of tension, of divide and conquer, of Balkanization via the Great Game.
[01:45:33.891 --> 01:45:38.972]  Let's go ahead and go to this five-minute video that breaks it down, the takedown of Hosni Mubarak.
[01:45:52.250 --> 01:45:55.576]  How dumb does the system think we are?
[01:45:55.576 --> 01:46:01.606]  30 years or three decades of his iron rule.
[01:46:03.161 --> 01:46:04.662]  Over the North African...
[01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:38.259]  Okay, we'll go ahead and play the video now.
[01:46:38.259 --> 01:46:38.601]  Here it is.
[01:46:46.553 --> 01:46:48.734]  How dumb does the system think we are?
[01:46:48.734 --> 01:46:57.217]  30 years or three decades of his iron rule over the North African state of Egypt.
[01:46:57.217 --> 01:47:04.839]  Hosni Mubarak refuses to step down even though the head of the CIA is in front of Congress saying he's going to step down in a few hours.
[01:47:04.839 --> 01:47:08.801]  Mubarak comes out and defiantly says, I will not step down.
[01:47:08.801 --> 01:47:11.982]  I will not let this foreign conspiracy overtake Egypt.
[01:47:13.413 --> 01:47:23.480]  And then magically, we're now told he had a stroke right after that, and the army announced the next day that they would be, quote, reforming things.
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:26.361]  This is a public military coup.
[01:47:26.361 --> 01:47:28.063]  There's no democratization.
[01:47:28.063 --> 01:47:30.744]  There's no calls for election.
[01:47:30.744 --> 01:47:37.889]  CNN and Anderson Cooper, who's admitted CIA, are announcing how great this move towards freedom is.
[01:47:37.889 --> 01:47:42.132]  Mubarak is reportedly in Egypt with a stroke, or maybe even dead he's in.
[01:47:43.604 --> 01:47:50.310]  Northern Israel, on the side of the sea, we don't know where he is.
[01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:51.671]  And where's the media?
[01:47:51.671 --> 01:47:56.135]  This is an issue that isn't even being discussed.
[01:47:56.135 --> 01:47:59.478]  Right after he says, I will not step down, this happens to him.
[01:48:00.489 --> 01:48:03.351]  What's developing here is the bodies are being buried.
[01:48:03.351 --> 01:48:09.795]  This guy has been the distribution center for the kidnapped people being taken to torture sites all over the world.
[01:48:09.795 --> 01:48:15.819]  This is the main central site for black sites or ghost sites where all this illegal activity is going on.
[01:48:15.819 --> 01:48:19.501]  This guy has the dirt on George W. Bush.
[01:48:19.501 --> 01:48:22.563]  He has the dirt on Barack Obama.
[01:48:22.563 --> 01:48:26.005]  This is the man who's followed all of their orders.
[01:48:27.295 --> 01:48:28.056]  There's a problem.
[01:48:28.056 --> 01:48:42.130]  In the last year, it's been reported that Hosni Mubarak refused to politically get behind greenlighting an attack on Iran when Egypt is on Israel's western flank.
[01:48:42.130 --> 01:48:45.374]  Hosni Mubarak refused to expand other wars in the region.
[01:48:45.874 --> 01:48:48.835]  And this is a message to all the other Arab regimes.
[01:48:48.835 --> 01:48:54.836]  You get behind this build-up towards war with Iran, or it's over for you politically.
[01:48:54.836 --> 01:49:03.418]  And now the Muslim Brotherhood is, admittedly, British intelligence, is trying to overthrow Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Jordan, all of these allies.
[01:49:03.418 --> 01:49:06.499]  What does this say to people that have gone along with the New World Order?
[01:49:06.499 --> 01:49:10.640]  What does it say to individuals watching out there that have bought into teaming up with this system?
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:14.401]  You will be betrayed in the end.
[01:49:14.401 --> 01:49:16.522]  How much more obvious does it have to get?
[01:49:16.522 --> 01:49:25.306]  And you look at the fate of Nasser with the heart attack after he gave a defiant speech and other leaders in Egypt and many other countries.
[01:49:25.306 --> 01:49:34.890]  This is a message being sent to the world, not just Middle Eastern politicians, not just politicians in Africa or Latin America or Asia, but to American politicians.
[01:49:36.189 --> 01:49:39.252]  Just like the message was sent with John F. Kennedy's murder.
[01:49:39.252 --> 01:49:44.337]  If you don't play ball and submit to the banking cartel, we will kill you.
[01:49:44.337 --> 01:49:49.061]  Whether it's a gunshot to the head or whether it's a convenient stroke or heart attack.
[01:49:49.061 --> 01:49:56.488]  But the current issue that's looking us right in the eyes, that's in our face, is why isn't the corporate media in the U.S.
[01:49:56.488 --> 01:49:58.850]  talking more about the mysterious disappearance
[01:49:59.531 --> 01:49:59.891]  I think?
[01:50:30.212 --> 01:50:33.895]  But why are they treating their servants so badly?
[01:50:33.895 --> 01:50:39.581]  Did they ask him to do something so horrible that his conscience kicked in?
[01:50:39.581 --> 01:50:41.843]  We know the facts.
[01:50:41.843 --> 01:50:46.567]  There was a Western-funded military coup of Egypt.
[01:50:46.567 --> 01:50:48.529]  There are no elections.
[01:50:48.529 --> 01:50:53.574]  Just like shark teeth, Mubarak has been removed and another row has rolled up.
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:57.881]  And then we're told this is freedom?
[01:50:57.881 --> 01:51:00.502]  The people are smart enough to understand what's happening.
[01:51:00.502 --> 01:51:07.405]  And if the globalists want dictatorships in Egypt, and every other country they influence, what do they want domestically?
[01:51:07.405 --> 01:51:09.826]  And we know, they want a police state tyranny.
[01:51:09.826 --> 01:51:15.349]  And the very same corporate interests that run Egypt run the United States through fraud.
[01:51:15.349 --> 01:51:22.432]  And they're threatening members of Congress, they're assassinating people, and we are all under this yoke of global corporate tyranny.
[01:51:23.112 --> 01:51:27.314]  But once we wake up and are aware of it, it loses its power.
[01:51:27.314 --> 01:51:28.695]  So wake up!
[01:51:28.695 --> 01:51:34.137]  To learn more about this and other vital topics, visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:51:34.137 --> 01:51:39.660]  When you're on the site, you can also tune in 24 hours a day to my daily radio broadcast.
[01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:43.802]  There's also a free iPhone app to listen to the syndicated radio show when and where you want.
[01:51:46.872 --> 01:51:57.540]  Okay, so there is that little five-minute video, the takedown of Hosni Mubarak, and it is, again, available at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:51:57.540 --> 01:52:08.107]  If you want to send somebody a five-minute video so you don't have to talk until you're blue in the face, talking to my neighbors, talking to friends, family, they say, well, what, you're saying the revolution isn't good in Egypt?
[01:52:08.107 --> 01:52:11.209]  And I'm like, no, the people have a right to revolt.
[01:52:12.270 --> 01:52:27.215]  They don't deserve to be under a dictatorship, but our supposed government chooses to put dictators in and to support dictators all over the world, including Hazi Mubarak, then suddenly they tell Mubarak to step down.
[01:52:27.215 --> 01:52:34.198]  When he doesn't step down, he has a stroke and disappears, and it's not a bigger media issue.
[01:52:34.198 --> 01:52:39.679]  And then there's the larger discussion in all of this that we have to look at, and
[01:52:43.058 --> 01:52:56.809]  That is, why on earth does our government try to put dictators in around the world, and what does that mean about what they want to install here in the United States?
[01:52:56.809 --> 01:52:58.831]  And then it goes even further.
[01:52:58.831 --> 01:53:05.796]  How do they go from telling us Mubarak's a great guy, to overnight, this is democracy, this is freedom, this is great what's happening.
[01:53:05.796 --> 01:53:08.419]  I mean, don't people put two and two together?
[01:53:08.419 --> 01:53:12.262]  They're not even setting up a constitutional republic.
[01:53:13.422 --> 01:53:19.623]  They're not even setting up mob rule democratization.
[01:53:19.623 --> 01:53:23.944]  They're just putting in the military men that were below him.
[01:53:23.944 --> 01:53:30.406]  And we know that Mubarak refused a year ago to get behind an attack on Iran.
[01:53:30.406 --> 01:53:34.947]  That is to politically support it and allow aircraft to overfly and land inside the country.
[01:53:35.916 --> 01:53:37.916]  And it's on the western flank of Israel.
[01:53:37.916 --> 01:53:41.057]  We know that he did a lot of other things that made them mad.
[01:53:41.057 --> 01:53:43.777]  And so, basically, a message is being sent.
[01:53:43.777 --> 01:53:48.138]  You do what you're told, or you're gonna have a stroke.
[01:53:48.138 --> 01:53:50.139]  Mubarak was told to step down.
[01:53:50.139 --> 01:53:51.819]  Our media said he was gonna step down.
[01:53:51.819 --> 01:53:53.519]  He was supposed to give a speech and step down.
[01:53:53.519 --> 01:53:57.580]  He defiantly got up and said, I'm not stepping down until September.
[01:53:57.580 --> 01:54:02.481]  I've gotta have this transition of government, or the country's gonna be engulfed into chaos.
[01:54:03.837 --> 01:54:10.361]  And he went further and said that more radical elements of Islam are going to get control and then we're going to end up having wars.
[01:54:10.361 --> 01:54:13.003]  That's the plan, Mubarak.
[01:54:13.003 --> 01:54:16.805]  That's the program that the globalists want.
[01:54:16.805 --> 01:54:18.126]  That's the strategy of tension.
[01:54:18.126 --> 01:54:19.827]  Brzezinski's written books on it.
[01:54:19.827 --> 01:54:21.548]  Kissinger's given speeches on it.
[01:54:21.548 --> 01:54:22.509]  This is not a secret.
[01:54:23.089 --> 01:54:30.254]  But the social controllers are counting on the general public not looking into this because it's too sophisticated on the surface.
[01:54:30.254 --> 01:54:33.057]  Let's go back to your phone calls ahead of Luke Radowsky joining us.
[01:54:33.057 --> 01:54:34.758]  Brian in Connecticut, thanks for holding.
[01:54:34.758 --> 01:54:36.980]  Welcome.
[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:37.800]  Hi Alex.
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:38.241]  Hey.
[01:54:38.241 --> 01:54:44.105]  Yeah, the thing is, you just did that video about the media not covering what's going on with Moombaark.
[01:54:44.105 --> 01:54:46.647]  It's quite obvious why they're not covering it.
[01:54:46.647 --> 01:54:48.108]  It doesn't suit their agenda.
[01:54:48.108 --> 01:54:50.830]  They want to try to keep us in the dark.
[01:54:52.222 --> 01:55:07.027]  You know, throughout all of the videos and documentaries that you have brought to Enlighten People, which I give you enormous respect and admiration for, the things I'm having a problem with is I've been unemployed for almost two years now.
[01:55:07.027 --> 01:55:09.248]  My benefits are going to be running out.
[01:55:09.248 --> 01:55:10.809]  My girlfriend works in retail.
[01:55:10.809 --> 01:55:12.449]  Her hours are being cut.
[01:55:12.449 --> 01:55:17.091]  Even during the busiest time of the year, during the holidays, she was working on part-time hours.
[01:55:17.091 --> 01:55:19.432]  You know, so our funds are running out.
[01:55:19.432 --> 01:55:20.292]  I don't have the money.
[01:55:20.731 --> 01:55:23.433]  To go make flyers, to make stickers.
[01:55:23.433 --> 01:55:35.560]  Anytime I look to find activist groups where I can join with them and go to my local government and protest what's going on, it almost seems like I'm being hindered from making connections with these people.
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:38.422]  I can't search through search engines to find them.
[01:55:38.422 --> 01:55:43.906]  My question to you is because you are a leader to the people, people are looking to you for direction.
[01:55:43.906 --> 01:55:48.849]  Is there any way that you can help in making connections from person A to person Z
[01:55:49.434 --> 01:56:01.881]  From the East Coast to the West Coast so that people can actually start to organize to make a movement because in my eye, I feel as though with what's been going on with politics since Reagan, since, you know, even way before, they're just puppets.
[01:56:01.881 --> 01:56:05.143]  You know, Obama came in screaming, change, I'm going to change, I'm going to change.
[01:56:05.143 --> 01:56:06.464]  He pulled the 180.
[01:56:06.464 --> 01:56:08.825]  What's to prevent Ron Paul from doing the same thing?
[01:56:09.201 --> 01:56:10.222]  I'm very skeptical.
[01:56:10.222 --> 01:56:12.304]  You know, I don't know who to turn to.
[01:56:12.304 --> 01:56:13.585]  I don't know who to trust.
[01:56:13.585 --> 01:56:14.966]  And I'm scared.
[01:56:14.966 --> 01:56:15.547]  I'm afraid.
[01:56:15.547 --> 01:56:16.608]  I lose sleep at night.
[01:56:16.608 --> 01:56:18.009]  I talk to all my neighbors.
[01:56:18.009 --> 01:56:19.270]  I talk to my friends.
[01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:26.937]  When I go into stores and I pay the cashier, I try to get their mind thinking of, you know, what's going on, maybe looking into it.
[01:56:26.937 --> 01:56:27.998]  Sure, sure, Brian.
[01:56:27.998 --> 01:56:30.500]  Brian, I understand your concern and I appreciate your call.
[01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:35.565]  Let me try to briefly answer that extremely deep and complex issue that you raised there.
[01:56:37.697 --> 01:56:42.799]  Let's just take one part of what you said, because so much was said.
[01:56:42.799 --> 01:56:45.020]  A, I can't do everything.
[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:48.921]  I've tried for several years to build a social network that works right.
[01:56:48.921 --> 01:56:53.063]  We built one, it got 30-something thousand members and started crashing and having problems.
[01:56:53.063 --> 01:56:56.184]  I built another one last year, paid for it, didn't work right.
[01:56:56.184 --> 01:57:01.526]  I've got now people hired in-house trying to just build a basic one for people to get connected and together.
[01:57:01.526 --> 01:57:04.067]  So I'm working as hard as I can.
[01:57:04.067 --> 01:57:05.968]  That said, I hear you, we're trying.
[01:57:07.372 --> 01:57:10.294]  I'm trying to step up to the plate here as best I can.
[01:57:10.294 --> 01:57:16.218]  Now, on the other issue of Ron Paul, look at Ron Paul's voting record.
[01:57:16.218 --> 01:57:18.919]  It's perfect as a constitutionalist.
[01:57:18.919 --> 01:57:20.240]  It's unbelievably good.
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:22.201]  He's a constitutionalist.
[01:57:22.201 --> 01:57:25.003]  And so you judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:57:25.003 --> 01:57:29.526]  Obama was a guy who said that he believes in the total abolition of firearms.
[01:57:29.526 --> 01:57:32.668]  He's a guy that gave speeches about how he wanted socialist health care.
[01:57:32.668 --> 01:57:33.949]  He's a guy who was financed
[01:57:35.114 --> 01:57:41.638]  With four times the money of John McCain by Wall Street and said he was going to be an anti-Wall Street corruption candidate.
[01:57:41.638 --> 01:57:44.720]  So a lot of that is just basic research and discernment.
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:47.701]  I mean, we didn't say Obama was going to be good.
[01:57:47.701 --> 01:57:50.023]  We said Obama was going to be bad and do just what he's done.
[01:57:50.723 --> 01:57:55.725]  And I made the seminal film, Obama Deception, that's evergreen and gets more important with time.
[01:57:55.725 --> 01:57:56.105]  Watch it.
[01:57:56.105 --> 01:57:57.205]  It's free online.
[01:57:57.205 --> 01:57:59.366]  Doesn't matter if you're not employed.
[01:57:59.366 --> 01:57:59.886]  It's free.
[01:57:59.886 --> 01:58:01.627]  Just Google the Obama Deception.
[01:58:01.627 --> 01:58:02.828]  Watch it for free.
[01:58:02.828 --> 01:58:03.948]  Email it to friends and family.
[01:58:03.948 --> 01:58:05.629]  That's basically free.
[01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:07.709]  I can't do more than that.
[01:58:07.709 --> 01:58:09.650]  But just to say, I don't know who to trust.
[01:58:09.650 --> 01:58:10.731]  I don't trust Ron Paul.
[01:58:10.731 --> 01:58:12.011]  Okay, well, whatever.
[01:58:12.011 --> 01:58:14.052]  Run for City Council yourself.
[01:58:14.052 --> 01:58:17.113]  You may not win, but you'll be able to be at the debates and inject real ideas.
[01:58:21.991 --> 01:58:25.353]  You know, to just say the globalists want you to give up.
[01:58:25.353 --> 01:58:32.276]  They want you to see how much fraud they've engaged in and then not believe that you have any power or there could be somebody real.
[01:58:32.276 --> 01:58:34.357]  Ron Paul is not the answer to all our problems.
[01:58:34.357 --> 01:58:38.519]  He's just one component to the answer and that answer is resistance.
[01:58:38.519 --> 01:58:42.941]  Resistance is victory!
[01:58:42.941 --> 01:58:46.743]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:52.173 --> 01:58:56.197]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:56.197 --> 01:58:59.441]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:59.441 --> 01:59:04.246]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:59:04.246 --> 01:59:10.633]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:10.633 --> 01:59:12.876]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:13.416 --> 01:59:13.716]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:13.716 --> 01:59:14.196]  Bernanke?
[01:59:14.196 --> 01:59:14.557]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:14.557 --> 01:59:15.337]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:15.337 --> 01:59:16.978]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:32.304 --> 01:59:34.165]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:34.165 --> 01:59:39.589]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.

[02:00:12.018 --> 02:00:13.559]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.559 --> 02:00:17.761]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.761 --> 02:00:23.384]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.384 --> 02:00:26.945]  We are now into hour number three, coming up in 30 minutes.
[02:00:26.945 --> 02:00:31.608]  Gerald Cilente on the economy, on the food riots intensifying all around the world.
[02:00:33.632 --> 02:00:38.837]  We're going to also get into other developments dealing with the internet kill switch.
[02:00:38.837 --> 02:00:40.938]  USA Today now finally covering it.
[02:00:40.938 --> 02:00:41.579]  It's real.
[02:00:41.579 --> 02:00:42.760]  It's happening.
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:53.189]  But Luke Radowsky, the founder of We Are Change, hundreds of chapters around the world confronting every global issue you can imagine, getting in Dick Cheney's face at CPAC last week.
[02:00:53.189 --> 02:00:58.654]  That video has now gone viral at wearechange.org and infowars.com.
[02:00:58.654 --> 02:00:59.755]  Listeners, you did a great job.
[02:01:00.936 --> 02:01:06.840]  Cheney's stand-down order, the number one search term yesterday, a whole bunch of news picked up on it and went, wow!
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:19.208]  You mean the head of the Transportation Department did say Cheney ordered a stand-down and they see the congressional C-SPAN clip?
[02:01:19.208 --> 02:01:21.810]  I mean, it's really gotten the word out.
[02:01:21.810 --> 02:01:28.795]  Luke, there's so much to discuss here, but in this segment, why don't you tell folks about the founding of We Are Change, you may not know all about it.
[02:01:29.555 --> 02:01:31.318]  And it's an idea.
[02:01:31.318 --> 02:01:32.680]  It's not centrally controlled.
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:38.448]  That's why it stopped infiltrators from being able to bring it down, because it's an idea, and ideas are bulletproof.
[02:01:38.448 --> 02:01:43.816]  And just the hundreds of globalists on both sides of the fake political spectrum you guys have confronted.
[02:01:44.437 --> 02:01:45.597]  Yeah, I mean, we are changing.
[02:01:45.597 --> 02:01:46.738]  You brought up the perfect fact.
[02:01:46.738 --> 02:01:47.358]  It's an idea.
[02:01:47.358 --> 02:01:49.359]  We're not really an official organization.
[02:01:49.359 --> 02:01:54.100]  There's really, you know, there's no kind of... There's nothing anything really special about it.
[02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:56.961]  It's just about fighting for liberty and doing the right thing.
[02:01:56.961 --> 02:02:01.022]  People get caught up with different organizations and who's doing this and who's doing that.
[02:02:01.022 --> 02:02:02.383]  But really, it doesn't matter.
[02:02:02.383 --> 02:02:06.984]  It's only the good work that people do to help promote education, to help other people.
[02:02:06.984 --> 02:02:08.945]  That really matters at the end of the day.
[02:02:08.945 --> 02:02:13.326]  And I just started going out there confronting Zbigniew Brzezinski, and ever since then,
[02:02:14.026 --> 02:02:25.216]  It's just been an onslaught of, you know, David Rockefeller, you know, Giuliani, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, you know, all the Rockefellers and so many other individuals we were able to confront.
[02:02:25.216 --> 02:02:32.562]  And the best thing about this is we were able to inspire so many other people to take action in their cities, in their towns, and do the same.
[02:02:32.842 --> 02:02:33.282]  That's right.
[02:02:33.282 --> 02:02:37.985]  We've seen Rothschilds confronted all over the world.
[02:02:37.985 --> 02:02:40.946]  And we now see other groups farming and confronting people.
[02:02:40.946 --> 02:02:45.348]  And that's good because it makes, you know, there's more targets of us out there, harder to stop us.
[02:02:45.348 --> 02:02:46.929]  We've seen Al Gore confronted.
[02:02:46.929 --> 02:02:48.630]  I mean, you name it.
[02:02:48.630 --> 02:02:54.773]  Jon Stewart, whose brother runs the New York Stock Exchange, telling us how good the New World Order is.
[02:02:54.773 --> 02:02:55.754]  He's being confronted.
[02:02:55.754 --> 02:02:58.415]  His goons attacked you guys and got arrested.
[02:02:58.415 --> 02:03:00.616]  I mean, we're really showing who these people are.
[02:03:00.856 --> 02:03:07.657]  Exactly, we just confronted David Horowitz, and I'm going to have more videos ready for everybody from, you know, my actions at TPAC.
[02:03:07.657 --> 02:03:13.459]  We got Newt Gingrich, we got James Woolsey, the former CIA director, you know, we got Michelle Bachmann.
[02:03:13.459 --> 02:03:18.760]  We're going to have so many more videos ready for everybody, and I'm just going to make this, you know, pretty much my full-time job.
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:23.921]  I want to go out there, I want to go to the Trilateral Commission meetings, the G20 meetings, the Bilderberg meetings.
[02:03:24.301 --> 02:03:35.932]  I want to go out there and, you know, be there wherever these people are and get in their face with the truth and just let them know because it is such a powerful act to let them know that we are not, you know, we are not sheeple.
[02:03:35.932 --> 02:03:36.953]  We are not stupid.
[02:03:36.953 --> 02:03:41.738]  We are intelligent, caring people who will give a damn and we'll make a difference in this world.
[02:03:41.738 --> 02:03:45.121]  And we will tell you, no, we're not going to have your one world government.
[02:03:45.121 --> 02:03:47.263]  You're not going to try to, you know, destroy this economy.
[02:03:47.483 --> 02:04:10.277]  Now we see folks, even when David Rockefeller is in Chile being confronted eloquently, we see Zbigniew Brzezinski, and this is the key, and I'm going to talk about it when we come back, but the globalists create a climate that is going to cause rebellion, but then they're going to try to steer the revolution towards solutions that bring more corruption, more power, more world government.
[02:04:10.277 --> 02:04:12.259]  That's why what We Are Change is doing.
[02:04:12.939 --> 02:04:14.860]  It's a continuing spiral and I've got to shout out Matisse Rojas.
[02:04:35.745 --> 02:04:37.787]  I confronted David Rockefeller in Chile.
[02:04:37.787 --> 02:04:45.173]  I was talking to him years before and seeing other people take action, stand up for themselves and believe in themselves.
[02:04:45.173 --> 02:04:46.574]  Leave Chile now!
[02:04:46.574 --> 02:04:47.414]  Leave Chile!
[02:04:47.414 --> 02:04:49.216]  We do not want your New World Order!
[02:04:49.216 --> 02:04:50.597]  You've killed a lot of people!
[02:04:50.597 --> 02:04:52.979]  You're killing a lot of people David Rockefeller!
[02:04:52.979 --> 02:04:54.280]  Leave Chile now!
[02:04:54.280 --> 02:05:00.245]  I mean that really and the way Dick Cheney looked at you and snarled but then put his head down and backed off.
[02:05:00.765 --> 02:05:05.308]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.308 --> 02:05:06.228]  Number 1.
[02:05:06.228 --> 02:05:09.650]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.650 --> 02:05:10.510]  Number 2.
[02:05:10.510 --> 02:05:15.393]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.393 --> 02:05:16.134]  It's true.
[02:05:16.134 --> 02:05:21.016]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.016 --> 02:05:21.837]  Number 3.
[02:05:21.837 --> 02:05:25.419]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.419 --> 02:05:29.121]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.321 --> 02:05:30.121]  Number 4.
[02:05:30.121 --> 02:05:32.882]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.882 --> 02:05:36.564]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.564 --> 02:05:37.344]  Number 5.
[02:05:37.344 --> 02:05:41.506]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.506 --> 02:05:46.548]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:46.548 --> 02:05:50.729]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:50.729 --> 02:05:52.510]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:57.112]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:06:00.535 --> 02:06:01.716]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:06:01.716 --> 02:06:08.642]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:06:08.642 --> 02:06:11.204]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:06:11.204 --> 02:06:16.589]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:06:16.589 --> 02:06:19.632]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:06:19.632 --> 02:06:21.694]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:06:21.934 --> 02:06:28.178]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:06:28.178 --> 02:06:31.560]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:37.344]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:06:37.344 --> 02:06:38.985]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:06:38.985 --> 02:06:40.285]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:06:40.285 --> 02:06:42.947]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:06:42.947 --> 02:06:44.368]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:06:44.628 --> 02:06:47.170]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:06:47.170 --> 02:06:51.793]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:06:51.793 --> 02:06:54.375]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:06:54.375 --> 02:06:58.238]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:06:58.238 --> 02:06:59.258]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:07:00.559 --> 02:07:04.141]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:07:04.141 --> 02:07:05.442]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:07:05.442 --> 02:07:09.845]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:07:09.845 --> 02:07:15.788]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:07:15.788 --> 02:07:17.929]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:07:17.929 --> 02:07:20.611]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:07:20.951 --> 02:07:27.456]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:07:27.456 --> 02:07:29.657]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:07:29.657 --> 02:07:35.001]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:07:35.001 --> 02:07:40.305]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:07:40.305 --> 02:07:45.469]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:07:45.649 --> 02:07:48.852]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:07:48.852 --> 02:07:51.856]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:07:51.856 --> 02:07:53.117]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:07:53.117 --> 02:07:55.920]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:24.198 --> 02:08:30.415]  If you're just joining us, one of the biggest success stories in true grassroots activism...
[02:08:31.796 --> 02:08:37.141]  is on the broadcast with us, Luke Rodowski, and Luke, I want to go back for new listeners that just joined us.
[02:08:37.141 --> 02:08:45.127]  Tell us about your awakening, your process so it can inspire others, because I forget the exact dates and details.
[02:08:45.127 --> 02:08:56.196]  What happened in New York 9-11 Truth, what you've done, getting together with the Building What campaign, now causing Geraldo Rivera to come out and say we need to look at 9-11 as an inside job, now causing
[02:08:56.977 --> 02:09:06.161]  Judge Andrew Napolitano on Fox to come out and say, and he said it on my show first, it made national news, that the official stories like the Kennedy story, it's impossible.
[02:09:06.161 --> 02:09:17.485]  I mean, again, taking action, getting involved, not infighting, getting in there, getting in the globalist faces, break that down for folks, and then we'll get into the Dick Cheney situation.
[02:09:17.865 --> 02:09:21.247]  I mean, it's just been such an inspiring and amazing ride.
[02:09:21.247 --> 02:09:25.789]  I mean, this life and just being an Awaken has changed my life for the better so much.
[02:09:25.789 --> 02:09:26.870]  And it's just been incredible.
[02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:31.632]  I mean, it started off with me getting beat up by the cops in New York City when I was 16, 17.
[02:09:31.632 --> 02:09:40.697]  And ever since then, I started looking into your work and you inspired me seeing your confrontation, seeing your information that you provide to us every single day.
[02:09:40.697 --> 02:09:42.418]  I take it and I run with it.
[02:09:42.418 --> 02:09:45.039]  And it's about, you know, we all have the same potential within all of us.
[02:09:45.319 --> 02:09:46.760]  We all have the same possibilities.
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:48.080]  We could do anything we want.
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:49.181]  Nothing is impossible.
[02:09:49.181 --> 02:09:55.784]  We just have to take it and run with it without fear, only with compassion and devotion, and we could do anything we want in this world.
[02:09:55.784 --> 02:09:57.025]  And we did the impossible.
[02:09:57.025 --> 02:10:01.187]  I mean, we helped sponsor bills in Congress that helped 9-11 first responders.
[02:10:01.187 --> 02:10:03.008]  We raised money for them.
[02:10:03.008 --> 02:10:05.529]  We do other, you know, community work here in the city.
[02:10:05.529 --> 02:10:10.532]  And it's about making a difference, not only for yourself, not only changing yourself, but changing the outside world.
[02:10:10.532 --> 02:10:13.253]  And it starts with the individual sitting at home right now, listening.
[02:10:13.733 --> 02:10:18.115]  And understanding that the power is within their own grasp, within their own hands.
[02:10:18.115 --> 02:10:23.738]  And what did Zbigniew Brzezinski say last year to the Council on Foreign Relations, televised on C-SPAN?
[02:10:23.738 --> 02:10:29.820]  He said, for the first time in world history, all of humanity is awake and staring.
[02:10:29.820 --> 02:10:32.862]  They are now looking past the puppets to the empire.
[02:10:32.862 --> 02:10:35.163]  And then he broke down the blocks of the empire.
[02:10:35.603 --> 02:10:41.346]  We've gone from Ron Paul not getting one co-sponsor 15, 16 years ago when he first got back into Congress.
[02:10:41.346 --> 02:10:44.828]  He'd done one, you know, term before that years before.
[02:10:44.828 --> 02:10:47.350]  To now passing the audit in the House.
[02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:51.152]  Sure it got killed in the Senate, but now people aren't looking at puppets.
[02:10:51.152 --> 02:10:53.694]  More and more they're looking at the real power structure.
[02:10:53.694 --> 02:11:00.758]  And once the majority of people see the real power structure and know it's the foreign banking occupation cartel, game over!
[02:11:01.158 --> 02:11:02.019]  It's over for them.
[02:11:02.019 --> 02:11:05.462]  And people need to understand, these people, they're not as all-powerful.
[02:11:05.462 --> 02:11:09.046]  I mean, people, people show them so much, you know, so much affection.
[02:11:09.046 --> 02:11:16.653]  People go up to them and, you know, they're dumb and blind, like that girl in the Dick Cheney video screaming, we love you, Dick Cheney.
[02:11:16.653 --> 02:11:18.234]  Thank you, you know, Miss Cheney.
[02:11:18.234 --> 02:11:20.176]  You know, but it takes this critical thinking.
[02:11:20.176 --> 02:11:24.740]  It takes just to look things up and do your own research and do your own homework.
[02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:26.162]  And just to find out how this is all
[02:11:26.522 --> 02:11:33.185]  Just a big game and how, really, you know, the biggest secret that they're hiding, you know, from all of us is that we have the power.
[02:11:33.185 --> 02:11:35.086]  We have all the authority within us.
[02:11:35.086 --> 02:11:36.687]  We can do what we want.
[02:11:36.687 --> 02:11:37.867]  And that's what they're afraid of.
[02:11:37.867 --> 02:11:44.731]  They're afraid of us waking up and understanding the power and the authority that we have within us to do what we want.
[02:11:44.731 --> 02:11:46.011]  And they want to keep us suppressed.
[02:11:46.011 --> 02:11:47.032]  They want to keep us down.
[02:11:47.032 --> 02:11:50.834]  They want to keep us fighting over stupid issues that don't even matter.
[02:11:50.834 --> 02:11:53.475]  And it's about just understanding life is short.
[02:11:53.835 --> 02:11:55.636]  And there has to be a better way.
[02:11:55.636 --> 02:11:57.758]  I know there is a better way, and that's why I fight.
[02:11:57.758 --> 02:11:59.379]  And I know that's why you fight.
[02:11:59.379 --> 02:12:03.842]  And, you know, with commitment, with just hard work, we can do anything we want.
[02:12:03.842 --> 02:12:06.884]  And that's why, you know, I'm doing everything I can right now.
[02:12:06.884 --> 02:12:08.425]  I have nothing else to do.
[02:12:08.425 --> 02:12:11.887]  And I'm going to work really hard on We Are Change full-time.
[02:12:11.887 --> 02:12:13.908]  I've never been able to give my full potential to this.
[02:12:13.908 --> 02:12:19.512]  Yeah, I told you years ago, Luke, and I guess when you started We Are Change, what, three years ago?
[02:12:19.512 --> 02:12:20.853]  Yeah, about three years ago when I was 20.
[02:12:21.613 --> 02:12:26.715]  So I told you then, I said, a college degree's great, but this is destiny here.
[02:12:26.715 --> 02:12:46.044]  You're already making international headlines every week, you're inspiring other people, you gotta create a foundation, get donations, and I even told you, I said, why give all the money you raise to other things and then don't have money for video cameras, and I'm having to send you, you know, four or five free video cameras, and you don't have money to travel.
[02:12:46.044 --> 02:12:47.405]  I said, people wanna fund
[02:12:47.865 --> 02:13:14.130]  You know what you're doing as the founder of this and then others can start their own we are change that follows the code and the principles and it's not some central control and they can go out and and and and confront politicians but you need to do this full time and then make a film to then sell it to then fund yourself with that seed money to really get in a position where you can do this full time and I'm very excited to hear that you're doing that now.
[02:13:14.130 --> 02:13:16.871]  Now I want to get into the Dick Cheney situation but first
[02:13:17.691 --> 02:13:29.155]  Before we go any further, tell us about what's coming up this year, the 10th anniversary in New York City of the staged false flag terror attacks that were meant to drive a stake through the heart of our Republic.
[02:13:29.155 --> 02:13:31.155]  Well, this year is going to be one of the biggest years.
[02:13:31.155 --> 02:13:34.196]  The 5th anniversary was the largest ever.
[02:13:34.196 --> 02:13:35.877]  This is the 10th year anniversary.
[02:13:35.877 --> 02:13:36.817]  We have to make a stand.
[02:13:36.817 --> 02:13:37.978]  We have to do something huge.
[02:13:37.978 --> 02:13:39.058]  We have to do something major.
[02:13:39.398 --> 02:13:45.443]  All I know right now is that everybody should be in New York City on Sunday, September 11, 2011.
[02:13:45.443 --> 02:13:46.864]  We're going to be there making a stand.
[02:13:46.864 --> 02:14:00.616]  We don't know if we're going to do a fan theater or not, but all I know is that we need to be at ground zero, sending out our message, not going out in silence, being proud of what we stand for, being proud of truth and justice, and standing there with the family members, standing there with the rescue workers.
[02:14:00.616 --> 02:14:03.758]  So I hope everybody makes plans for New York City early.
[02:14:03.758 --> 02:14:05.460]  We're going to make huge, you know, we're going to do
[02:14:05.660 --> 02:14:06.280]  Huge thanks
[02:14:20.765 --> 02:14:28.489]  Well, Luke, 9-11 is the foundation of the wars, the Patriot Act, the naked body scanners, the hands down the pants at the TSA.
[02:14:28.489 --> 02:14:30.150]  It's the pretext for everything.
[02:14:30.150 --> 02:14:37.574]  It must be exposed, that fraud, that false religious
[02:14:39.375 --> 02:14:48.398]  system of worshipping tyranny, this cult of tyranny that 9-11 is central to, must fall.
[02:14:48.398 --> 02:14:58.021]  But we see 9-11 truth with more and more scientists, more and more former Italian presidents, former German defense ministers, number three in the Japanese government.
[02:14:58.021 --> 02:15:00.242]  I mean, constantly, former U.S.
[02:15:00.242 --> 02:15:02.523]  Senators, more and more prominent people.
[02:15:02.523 --> 02:15:03.283]  What did you think
[02:15:03.923 --> 02:15:09.868]  About Geraldo Rivera having the Building What campaign, which our listeners donated to the very kickoff of.
[02:15:09.868 --> 02:15:19.216]  Our listeners, again, giving you the credit, folks, so they could get those ads on in New York saying Building What, Building 7, 30-second ad that Geraldo Rivera covers it.
[02:15:19.216 --> 02:15:24.080]  Then Judge Napolitano comes on this show and says there's no way the official story's real, we're being lied to.
[02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:24.880]  I don't know.
[02:15:45.473 --> 02:16:08.002]  Not even rebirth, because it was always growing, but the acceleration, the waxing, the expanding, the exploding of 9-11 truth and taking that tool of false flag terror away from the globalists, where now, anytime they stage an underwear bombing or something, our listeners are on board, they see the US government get him on the plane, the government denies it for two months, and then it comes out that they did do it!
[02:16:08.002 --> 02:16:10.343]  I mean, people are having an awakening!
[02:16:10.723 --> 02:16:12.345]  Our people are everywhere.
[02:16:12.345 --> 02:16:21.093]  Inside the military, the police, on airplanes, in the cockpit, and in the passenger area, and in the factories, and on the borders, and in the media.
[02:16:21.093 --> 02:16:26.798]  I mean, we got the Popular Mechanics article months before it came out from moles inside.
[02:16:26.798 --> 02:16:33.044]  We get the hit pieces from MSNBC before they're out.
[02:16:33.044 --> 02:16:34.245]  Our people are everywhere.
[02:16:34.565 --> 02:16:40.251]  It's so amazing seeing the lie being chipped away, chip by chip, just with little actions that we do.
[02:16:40.251 --> 02:16:49.581]  And even having Geraldo Rivera come out with the truth, he was the last person I ever expected to come out in full support of rebuilding what?
[02:16:49.581 --> 02:16:50.422]  And the whole...
[02:16:51.222 --> 02:17:05.192]  9-11, and just seeing that, it was just so incredible, especially after the incident me and you had with him in 2007, and if Raul Rivera could come out and openly talk about 9-11 Truth on his newscast, the potential is amazing.
[02:17:05.192 --> 02:17:14.878]  And that's why Cass Sunstein calls for the open infiltration of this 9-11 Truth movement, openly calls for the government sending out disinformation to try to counter us and try to get rid of us.
[02:17:14.878 --> 02:17:19.841]  That's why the Southern Poverty Law Center puts them on Patriot Most Wanted list, because they're afraid of us.
[02:17:19.841 --> 02:17:20.502]  They have fear.
[02:17:20.962 --> 02:17:25.123]  And one thing that we have that they don't have is love and compassion, and they're afraid of that.
[02:17:25.123 --> 02:17:26.264]  They're afraid of truth.
[02:17:26.264 --> 02:17:29.845]  They're afraid of liberty and justice, and that's why it's just so amazing.
[02:17:29.845 --> 02:17:35.027]  It's just been such an incredible, life-changing experience to see the difference in people.
[02:17:35.027 --> 02:17:38.188]  I mean, in New York City, I started out, what, seven, eight years ago?
[02:17:38.188 --> 02:17:42.869]  At being at Ground Zero, people spit at you, people were mad, and now it's totally different.
[02:17:42.869 --> 02:17:44.790]  People are waking up to the ideas.
[02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:46.190]  People are researching.
[02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:48.631]  People are not just believing the lamestream media.
[02:17:48.991 --> 02:17:54.917]  And they're going online and they're looking up real journalists who are going up to these people and asking them the real questions about 9-11.
[02:17:54.917 --> 02:17:57.039]  And we're going to be doing this full-time.
[02:17:57.039 --> 02:17:58.261]  We're not giving up.
[02:17:58.261 --> 02:18:03.906]  And I feel so bad not being able to put my full potential into We Are Change because of school and because of work.
[02:18:03.906 --> 02:18:04.447]  But right now,
[02:18:04.787 --> 02:18:05.327]  This is it.
[02:18:05.327 --> 02:18:06.608]  I mean, this is the time.
[02:18:06.608 --> 02:18:07.929]  We're just getting started.
[02:18:07.929 --> 02:18:09.631]  You're going to see a whole bunch of new videos.
[02:18:09.631 --> 02:18:13.734]  You're going to see us organizing huge events, and we're not backing down for this.
[02:18:13.734 --> 02:18:25.022]  We're in this for the long run, and we're not giving up until we have liberty, until we have true freedom, and until we accomplish what we wanted, which is a better life, which is a better world for us and our children, for God's sake.
[02:18:26.001 --> 02:18:38.167]  Well, you're right, Luke, and if we don't expose the narrative, the hoax, the fable, the fiction of 9-11, it is what they're going to continue to use to destroy our republic.
[02:18:38.167 --> 02:18:43.950]  We're going to go to break and come back and talk about the Dick Cheney situation, but just briefly,
[02:18:45.209 --> 02:18:45.970]  It's beautiful.
[02:18:45.970 --> 02:18:47.411]  I love seeing people take action.
[02:18:47.411 --> 02:18:48.693]  Call yourselves whatever you want.
[02:18:48.693 --> 02:18:50.594]  Just go out there and do something.
[02:18:50.594 --> 02:18:52.516]  It's such an incredible feeling.
[02:18:52.516 --> 02:18:54.438]  It's such an incredible rush to help people.
[02:19:08.892 --> 02:19:09.652]  Well, you're right.
[02:19:34.497 --> 02:19:35.998]  Now, now, you were at CPAC.
[02:19:35.998 --> 02:19:38.419]  I want to do a little bit on Chaney and your confrontation with him.
[02:19:38.419 --> 02:19:42.642]  The videos at WeAreChange.org and the articles we wrote at Infowars.com.
[02:19:42.642 --> 02:19:47.765]  But I also want to spend a little bit of the time we have with him, we're almost out of time unfortunately, talking about Ron Paul.
[02:19:47.765 --> 02:19:49.386]  He won second year in a row.
[02:19:49.386 --> 02:19:55.829]  Fox ran a hoax and showed video from last year of some people booing him and said it was this year.
[02:19:55.829 --> 02:19:59.992]  That'll give you an idea of just how wicked and scared these people are of the truth.
[02:20:01.795 --> 02:20:04.977]  Forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage.
[02:20:04.977 --> 02:20:13.082]  When the collapse happens, you'll need the single most effective way to get high-powered Delta Force nutrients to your family, fast.
[02:20:13.082 --> 02:20:16.164]  Like any Special Forces commando, you need a plan.
[02:20:16.164 --> 02:20:18.706]  You need a Black Hawk Down food plan.
[02:20:18.706 --> 02:20:21.828]  Introducing the Survival Sprout Bank from Solutions from Science.

[02:21:00.658 --> 02:21:01.839]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:21:01.839 --> 02:21:08.804]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:21:08.804 --> 02:21:11.386]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:21:11.386 --> 02:21:16.790]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:19.732]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:21:19.732 --> 02:21:21.814]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:21:22.054 --> 02:21:28.337]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:21:28.337 --> 02:21:31.738]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:21:31.738 --> 02:21:37.541]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:21:37.541 --> 02:21:39.202]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:21:39.202 --> 02:21:40.522]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:21:40.522 --> 02:21:43.203]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:21:43.203 --> 02:21:44.624]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:21:44.804 --> 02:21:48.425]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[02:21:48.425 --> 02:21:52.687]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[02:21:52.687 --> 02:21:58.029]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience,

[02:23:06.011 --> 02:23:06.851]  Why Ali-C?

[02:23:18.479 --> 02:23:24.062]  Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[02:23:24.062 --> 02:23:29.264]  Studies show Ali-C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[02:23:29.264 --> 02:23:32.966]  One tablet of Ali-C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.

[02:23:52.416 --> 02:23:53.477]  They don't want to see us unite.
[02:24:09.565 --> 02:24:10.946]  They don't want to see us get together.
[02:24:10.946 --> 02:24:20.975]  Luke Rudowsky's our guest.
[02:24:20.975 --> 02:24:23.818]  They know that the American people want Ron Paul.
[02:24:25.859 --> 02:24:33.503]  And so, they don't even really report that he wins the straw poll, and they show video of people booing him a year ago and say that happened there.
[02:24:33.503 --> 02:24:34.643]  Fox News has been caught.
[02:24:34.643 --> 02:24:36.784]  Fox News caught in shocking dirty tricks.
[02:24:36.784 --> 02:24:38.345]  Stunt against Ron Paul.
[02:24:38.345 --> 02:24:40.206]  We're doing the Google search term today.
[02:24:40.206 --> 02:24:41.306]  Make it number one, folks.
[02:24:41.306 --> 02:24:41.966]  You're awesome.
[02:24:41.966 --> 02:24:43.867]  Fox News caught.
[02:24:43.867 --> 02:24:46.048]  Fox News caught, and that will lead them to it.
[02:24:46.048 --> 02:24:47.189]  You were there at CPAC.
[02:24:47.189 --> 02:24:49.450]  What did you think of how they were trying to treat Ron Paul, Luke?
[02:24:49.986 --> 02:24:52.728]  I mean, I met a lot of amazing Ron Paul supporters.
[02:24:52.728 --> 02:24:59.593]  They're incredible people and there were a lot of different neocons there who were just glimmering and were so angry when he was speaking.
[02:24:59.593 --> 02:25:02.716]  And you know, it was just incredible.
[02:25:02.716 --> 02:25:05.358]  I mean, hearing Ron Paul speak inspired me so much.
[02:25:05.918 --> 02:25:07.539]  I got a little interview with him, too.
[02:25:07.539 --> 02:25:10.100]  It's going to be on We Are Change in a couple days.
[02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:12.061]  You know, we're going to release the new Skin Rich video.
[02:25:12.061 --> 02:25:14.782]  We confronted him on the Bohemian Grove there.
[02:25:14.782 --> 02:25:26.788]  My friend Anthony Antello from We Are Change Pennsylvania got Donald Rumsfeld on the $2.3 trillion that was missing, and we came in on their first day, and we pretty much wreaked havoc the first day.
[02:25:26.788 --> 02:25:32.531]  And then the next day we came back, they pretty much set up fake walls so we couldn't get anywhere near these people.
[02:25:32.671 --> 02:25:37.673]  See, Cass Sunstein wants to infiltrate us, we're infiltrating them, and they can't stand it.
[02:25:37.673 --> 02:25:39.453]  We're on the march, they're on the run.
[02:25:39.453 --> 02:25:47.376]  Yeah, and there are so many amazing people out there who are aware of the work, who are, you know, supporting us, who are giving us tips, where all the other politicians were.
[02:25:47.376 --> 02:25:56.859]  And the CPAC people, I mean, they literally had to put up fake walls from one exit to another exit, so all these politicians wouldn't have anybody coming up to them and asking them questions.
[02:25:57.199 --> 02:26:03.825]  And I'm just so proud to have everybody there with, you know, Danny Penzella and James Lane and so many other great activists out there.
[02:26:03.825 --> 02:26:08.670]  And we pretty much wrecked havoc at CPAC, and we pretty much took it over with the questions.
[02:26:08.670 --> 02:26:17.878]  The Ron Paul people were amazing, and it was just one of the best experiences of my life seeing so many people caring for liberty, caring for freedom, and, you know, standing there.
[02:26:18.058 --> 02:26:21.881]  And Cheney got booed when he was on stage, then confronted over and over again.
[02:26:21.881 --> 02:26:30.466]  It lets them know, wherever they go in the world, they're getting confronted, that we are aware of them, and it really makes them back off at many levels.
[02:26:30.466 --> 02:26:34.008]  They've backed off on trying to get our guns, because they know we're waking up.
[02:26:34.008 --> 02:26:35.649]  They're backing off on so many issues.
[02:26:35.649 --> 02:26:42.294]  Luke, in closing, and again, the video's at wearechange.org, it's also at infowars.com, Cheney tried to snarl at you.
[02:26:42.774 --> 02:26:46.315]  But then put his head down and kind of just crawled off into the elevator.
[02:26:46.315 --> 02:26:52.338]  I mean, you got right in his face, but calmly let him know that you're aware that he was involved in 9-11.
[02:26:52.338 --> 02:26:53.758]  It was an incredible feeling.
[02:26:53.758 --> 02:26:59.941]  And the rush that I got after that, the adrenaline was just so powerful, so amazing.
[02:26:59.941 --> 02:27:03.162]  And one thing I just hope, you know, don't thank me for doing it.
[02:27:03.162 --> 02:27:07.684]  The biggest thanks you could give me is going out there yourself and confronting your local politician.
[02:27:08.004 --> 02:27:09.085]  You're a local congressman.
[02:27:09.085 --> 02:27:10.085]  Don't thank me.
[02:27:10.085 --> 02:27:11.506]  I'm just one individual doing it.
[02:27:11.506 --> 02:27:12.246]  I'm not perfect.
[02:27:12.246 --> 02:27:13.407]  I made mistakes.
[02:27:13.407 --> 02:27:15.968]  You know, I don't ask the best questions.
[02:27:15.968 --> 02:27:18.089]  English is my second language, for God's sakes.
[02:27:18.089 --> 02:27:22.852]  And I messed up big time, too, because I messed up on John Bolton and Allen West.
[02:27:22.852 --> 02:27:25.133]  My microphone wasn't working and so many other ones.
[02:27:25.573 --> 02:27:36.403]  But we're going to have some good stuff out there and one thing I just hope out of all this is when you see it, you know, I hope it inspires you to take action and to go out there and to do it yourself because we're taking back the mainstream media.
[02:27:36.403 --> 02:27:37.964]  We are the mainstream media.
[02:27:37.964 --> 02:27:46.332]  We're going out there and asking the real questions and people are aware of that and people are paying attention and it's up to us just to keep working, keep busting our humps and
[02:27:46.972 --> 02:27:50.074]  Well, that brings me to this last point.
[02:27:50.074 --> 02:27:56.840]  Sunstein, the regulations are at the White House and others, they've been admittedly building the cybersecurity takeover of the web.
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:00.743]  They're now admitting it's to shut the web off and to slowly start curtailing it.
[02:28:00.743 --> 02:28:02.204]  They can do either.
[02:28:02.204 --> 02:28:10.190]  They're telling us, oh, have freedom of the Internet in Egypt when Google's over there running the overthrow of their old apprentice, their old puppet.
[02:28:10.190 --> 02:28:15.334]  Now USA Today has the headline, Kill Switch Internet Bill Alarms Privacy Experts.
[02:28:15.894 --> 02:28:19.816]  And they just go on and admit, yeah, they're getting ready to put in the power to shut off the web.
[02:28:19.816 --> 02:28:21.558]  They're scared of the American people.
[02:28:21.558 --> 02:28:22.338]  They definitely are.
[02:28:22.338 --> 02:28:24.760]  And I'm not afraid of their, you know, internet kill switch.
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:33.705]  I know there's so many great hackers out there, so many tech geeks out there who know other forms of communications, who know how to bypass a lot of different things.
[02:28:33.705 --> 02:28:34.906]  So they have to be very careful.
[02:28:34.906 --> 02:28:36.907]  There's micro-FM, there's hanging up flyers.
[02:28:36.907 --> 02:28:41.470]  The more they try to suppress and bury the truth, the more it's going to stand out for people.
[02:28:41.710 --> 02:28:42.170]  Exactly.
[02:28:42.170 --> 02:28:44.912]  The more they try to stop us, the more we grow.
[02:28:44.912 --> 02:28:47.854]  So, you know, they can't really do anything to us.
[02:28:47.854 --> 02:28:48.995]  They know they messed up.
[02:28:48.995 --> 02:28:52.297]  They know that we're doing the right thing peacefully, non-violently.
[02:28:52.297 --> 02:28:56.800]  They know we're the ones trying to take back this country and make a better life for everybody.
[02:28:56.800 --> 02:29:01.083]  And they know they've really made a big mistake and they're pretty much screwed.
[02:29:01.083 --> 02:29:09.729]  And it's up to all of us to take advantage of the situation and to just go out there and to, you know, be the full potential that we are, that we all can be with and all inside of us.
[02:29:10.117 --> 02:29:11.246]  Well, Luke, uh...
[02:29:12.253 --> 02:29:13.854]  Be the change you want to see in the world.
[02:29:13.854 --> 02:29:17.957]  First they ignore you, then they attack you, then they laugh at you, then you win.
[02:29:17.957 --> 02:29:24.821]  Resistance is victory, and you and all the great folks that have led by your example are a testament to that.
[02:29:24.821 --> 02:29:32.827]  And so you didn't even talk about the death threats you get, your family getting death threats, the things you've gone through to get the truth out.
[02:29:32.827 --> 02:29:34.308]  But it's the only choice we've got.
[02:29:34.308 --> 02:29:37.190]  It's freedom or slavery, and you have chosen freedom.
[02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:38.030]  I choose freedom.
[02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:39.651]  I choose liberty with you.
[02:29:39.651 --> 02:29:42.193]  And it's just I'm honored to know you, my brother.
[02:29:42.493 --> 02:29:50.543]  I'm honored that you woke me up, brother, and you helped me, you know, get here, and I thank you so much for all the work you do, and I wish you the best, and I'm here with you, brother, and whatever.
[02:29:50.543 --> 02:29:50.763]  You too.
[02:29:50.763 --> 02:29:51.404]  God bless you.
[02:29:51.404 --> 02:29:55.248]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.248 --> 02:29:57.931]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:05.223 --> 02:30:06.484]  Tyranny is here.
[02:30:06.484 --> 02:30:10.408]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:10.408 --> 02:30:12.631]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:12.631 --> 02:30:18.517]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:30:18.517 --> 02:30:24.763]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:30:25.163 --> 02:30:31.144]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:30:31.144 --> 02:30:35.325]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:30:35.325 --> 02:30:39.626]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:30:39.626 --> 02:30:45.567]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:45.567 --> 02:30:49.107]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:30:49.107 --> 02:30:51.088]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:30:51.088 --> 02:30:51.528]  It's here.

[02:31:00.905 --> 02:31:04.727]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[02:31:04.727 --> 02:31:09.009]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:31:09.009 --> 02:31:13.831]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:31:13.831 --> 02:31:19.654]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:31:19.654 --> 02:31:26.617]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:31:29.429 --> 02:31:34.972]  I'm looking for America.
[02:31:34.972 --> 02:31:36.593]  Wear American and be proud.
[02:31:36.593 --> 02:31:39.354]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:31:39.354 --> 02:31:43.837]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[02:31:43.837 --> 02:31:47.739]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[02:31:55.265 --> 02:32:00.572]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:32:00.572 --> 02:32:05.138]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[02:32:05.138 --> 02:32:09.464]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.464 --> 02:32:09.945]  Number two,
[02:32:10.325 --> 02:32:15.207]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.207 --> 02:32:15.948]  It's true.
[02:32:15.948 --> 02:32:21.650]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:21.650 --> 02:32:25.232]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.232 --> 02:32:29.954]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:29.954 --> 02:32:32.715]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.715 --> 02:32:36.057]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.377 --> 02:32:41.319]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.319 --> 02:32:46.360]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.360 --> 02:32:50.542]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.542 --> 02:32:52.322]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:52.322 --> 02:32:56.924]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:02.523 --> 02:33:03.404]  Yeah.
[02:33:23.988 --> 02:33:26.169]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:26.169 --> 02:33:31.131]  Gerald Cilente, for the next 30 minutes, is our guest, founder of the Trends Research Institute.
[02:33:31.131 --> 02:33:33.331]  Really needs no introduction here.
[02:33:33.331 --> 02:33:39.914]  And, of course, many years ago, he predicted the commodity prices, the oil, the food going up, triggering food riots.
[02:33:39.914 --> 02:33:43.855]  He, of course, predicted the Tea Party rising several years before it did.
[02:33:43.855 --> 02:33:45.716]  And he is a frequent
[02:33:45.896 --> 02:33:46.116]  I think
[02:34:06.311 --> 02:34:20.601]  The governor of Wisconsin coming out on NPR on Monday and saying, oh, if state employees don't like their pay being slashed and us taking more of their money for the pension fund, we'll just call the National Guard out on them.
[02:34:20.601 --> 02:34:22.902]  And some say, yeah, cut their pay.
[02:34:22.902 --> 02:34:24.983]  That'll pay off the deficit.
[02:34:24.983 --> 02:34:26.424]  It's the derivatives.
[02:34:26.424 --> 02:34:28.466]  That's 1.5 quadrillion.
[02:34:28.466 --> 02:34:32.549]  You could cut everything and it wouldn't pay for even a few percentage points of it.
[02:34:32.549 --> 02:34:34.050]  We don't owe this money.
[02:34:34.050 --> 02:34:35.911]  And so Gerald has broken all this down.
[02:34:36.852 --> 02:34:47.404]  I want him to go over it and give us the big picture, geopolitically, of what's happening and continuing to tweak his trends forecast, what he sees coming up in the next few months here in the United States.
[02:34:47.404 --> 02:34:49.006]  Gerald, great having you with us.
[02:34:49.006 --> 02:34:50.567]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[02:34:50.567 --> 02:34:51.408]  You've got the floor.
[02:34:51.408 --> 02:34:52.329]  What do you want to cover first?
[02:34:53.018 --> 02:34:54.919]  Well, let's look at Egypt first.
[02:34:54.919 --> 02:34:59.222]  If you go back to our Trends Journal, we've been predicting this.
[02:34:59.222 --> 02:35:04.846]  About two years ago, we came out with Workers of the World Unite 2.0.
[02:35:04.846 --> 02:35:09.389]  This has nothing to do with democracy, theocracy.
[02:35:09.389 --> 02:35:12.731]  It has to do with the bottom line, and the bottom line is this.
[02:35:14.011 --> 02:35:22.433]  When the money stops flowing down to Main Street, the blood begins to flow on the streets.
[02:35:22.433 --> 02:35:25.573]  And the money is not flowing down.
[02:35:25.573 --> 02:35:39.716]  We're looking at, for example, in Egypt, the per capita wage, the average wage of an Egyptian is $10 a day.
[02:35:39.716 --> 02:35:42.297]  That's according to the Egyptian statistics.
[02:35:42.867 --> 02:35:47.890]  Now, when you see food prices going up, you've got a lot of angry people.
[02:35:47.890 --> 02:35:53.354]  Because the cream at the top of the pyramid, if you will, they're taking all the dough.
[02:35:53.354 --> 02:36:08.103]  So what we wrote about also in the Trends Journal that you have, the winter edition that went out just weeks before, days actually, before the Tunisian uprisings, we sent out a synopsis.
[02:36:08.983 --> 02:36:12.846]  One of them was Youth of the World Unite.
[02:36:12.846 --> 02:36:16.968]  And I've been talking about this on your show as well.
[02:36:16.968 --> 02:36:19.230]  Hear these kids figure it out.
[02:36:19.230 --> 02:36:23.252]  You have a 50% unemployment rate in Spain.
[02:36:23.252 --> 02:36:24.773]  Probably in Italy it's around 35.
[02:36:26.454 --> 02:36:27.755]  The kid's angry.
[02:36:27.755 --> 02:36:31.196]  They have college degrees in worthlessness.
[02:36:31.196 --> 02:36:33.577]  There's no job future.
[02:36:33.577 --> 02:36:36.478]  They have this white-shoe boy language.
[02:36:36.478 --> 02:36:36.878]  I love it.
[02:36:36.878 --> 02:36:37.898]  You brought it up.
[02:36:37.898 --> 02:36:39.819]  Austerity measures.
[02:36:39.819 --> 02:36:41.520]  Here's some austerity measures.
[02:36:42.677 --> 02:36:45.958]  We're going to cut the minimum wage, as they did in Ireland, 12%.
[02:36:45.958 --> 02:36:48.699]  They're not making anything.
[02:36:48.699 --> 02:36:50.560]  Anyway, let's cut it lower.
[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:56.743]  We're going to increase the cost of everything, all the services, all the licensing fees.
[02:36:56.743 --> 02:37:01.764]  We'll be after you for every little thing you do wrong, and you'll pay more for it.
[02:37:01.764 --> 02:37:03.865]  And we're going to cut services.
[02:37:03.865 --> 02:37:04.846]  Oh, and by the way,
[02:37:05.686 --> 02:37:09.547]  Those pensions, we're going to cut those along with their benefits.
[02:37:09.547 --> 02:37:13.289]  And your retirement age, I got a good one for you.
[02:37:13.289 --> 02:37:18.130]  We're going to increase the retirement age till after you die.
[02:37:18.130 --> 02:37:19.451]  How's that?
[02:37:19.451 --> 02:37:20.731]  Oh, one other thing.
[02:37:20.731 --> 02:37:23.472]  We're going to raise taxes across the board.
[02:37:23.472 --> 02:37:25.233]  And we have to do this.
[02:37:25.233 --> 02:37:32.835]  Because the White Shoe Boys, I love the language, they don't want to take a haircut on the bad bets that they made.
[02:37:32.835 --> 02:37:34.216]  So you have to pay them off.
[02:37:34.758 --> 02:37:40.324]  What's going on in, as we said, Off With Their Heads 2.0, the Autumn Trends Journal?
[02:37:40.324 --> 02:37:41.785]  What's going on in Tunisia?
[02:37:41.785 --> 02:37:43.507]  What's going on in Egypt?
[02:37:43.507 --> 02:37:46.670]  It's not, it's not Arab exclusive.
[02:37:46.670 --> 02:37:51.055]  You know, it is the beginning of, it's going to go to Europe, as we said.
[02:37:51.055 --> 02:37:51.635]  You know, Alex?
[02:37:52.878 --> 02:38:02.526]  Remember when you were a kid, they taught you in school, World War I began when they assassinated the Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo.
[02:38:02.526 --> 02:38:06.809]  And you had the multiple choice junk, you know, you had to figure it out, the dates.
[02:38:06.809 --> 02:38:07.930]  No, it didn't.
[02:38:07.930 --> 02:38:09.932]  There were brush fires.
[02:38:09.932 --> 02:38:15.997]  The aristocracy started losing their money and they started trying to steal it from everybody else.
[02:38:15.997 --> 02:38:17.959]  And they're doing the same thing now.
[02:38:17.959 --> 02:38:21.702]  We are on the doorstep of the first great war
[02:38:22.102 --> 02:38:25.987]  The Spring Trends Journal of the 20th century.
[02:38:25.987 --> 02:38:29.290]  The brush fires are starting in Tunisia.
[02:38:29.290 --> 02:38:31.413]  They're starting in Egypt.
[02:38:31.413 --> 02:38:39.302]  They're starting in Bahrain, in Iran, in Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Greece.
[02:38:40.203 --> 02:38:53.970]  Spain, Portugal, Italy, the UK, you're going to see uprisings around the world as the little people start getting squeezed more and more.
[02:38:53.970 --> 02:39:01.454]  Well, Gerald, now the UK is reporting 4% increase in inflation a month, and that's even the government's own Cook numbers.
[02:39:02.034 --> 02:39:07.921]  We're getting more reports every day of TSA agents planting drugs on people, sexually harassing them.
[02:39:07.921 --> 02:39:11.525]  One guy stole 160,000 reportedly from check bags.
[02:39:11.525 --> 02:39:16.551]  I mean, we're just seeing more and more corruption come out and now every major
[02:39:17.632 --> 02:39:22.756]  Islamic nation in the Middle East is in turmoil.
[02:39:22.756 --> 02:39:24.377]  That is spreading.
[02:39:24.377 --> 02:39:25.999]  In fact, here are some of the headlines.
[02:39:25.999 --> 02:39:29.041]  Egypt's protest flared despite military warning.
[02:39:29.041 --> 02:39:31.183]  Anti-government protests spread to Libya.
[02:39:31.183 --> 02:39:33.745]  Thousands of police confront protesters in Yemen.
[02:39:33.745 --> 02:39:36.166]  Protests are spreading all over Saudi Arabia.
[02:39:36.166 --> 02:39:40.390]  Bahrain protesters urge more pressure.
[02:39:40.390 --> 02:39:43.532]  100 Egyptians reach Italy amid Arab exodus.
[02:39:43.532 --> 02:39:45.974]  Carter says Muslim Brotherhood nothing to be afraid of.
[02:39:47.835 --> 02:39:52.376]  So the social engineers knew that these upheavals were about to happen because of food prices.
[02:39:52.376 --> 02:40:01.258]  Their own reports admitted that, so they went in and triggered the overthrow of Mubarak, thinking they're going to control it, but clearly they're not going to be able to control it.
[02:40:01.258 --> 02:40:05.419]  And you talked about war in the Middle East being the answer to this depression.
[02:40:05.419 --> 02:40:16.382]  Clearly the social engineers are trying to nudge this crisis in a direction they can control, and then they will pose as the arbiters or the referees of the unfolding crisis.
[02:40:17.344 --> 02:40:18.885]  I don't know if it's being engineered.
[02:40:18.885 --> 02:40:21.065]  I think the whole thing's out of control the way I see it.
[02:40:21.065 --> 02:40:25.087]  No, no, they know it's out of control, so they went ahead and triggered it.
[02:40:25.087 --> 02:40:26.527]  Oh yeah, they're gonna engineer it.
[02:40:26.527 --> 02:40:27.508]  I mean, let's go back.
[02:40:27.508 --> 02:40:30.449]  Let's play back the Egyptian uprising.
[02:40:30.449 --> 02:40:33.930]  As it began, we heard from Joe Biden, right?
[02:40:33.930 --> 02:40:39.032]  He said that Mubarak wasn't a dictator and he should stay in office.
[02:40:39.032 --> 02:40:41.673]  I looked about how long was Mubarak in for 30 years.
[02:40:41.673 --> 02:40:45.014]  You know how long Biden's been sucking off the public tit?
[02:40:46.276 --> 02:40:47.497]  36 years!
[02:40:47.497 --> 02:40:50.338]  Of course he wasn't a dictator, not to Biden.
[02:40:50.338 --> 02:40:54.559]  He's been living his whole life on the, on the, off us.
[02:40:54.559 --> 02:40:58.041]  And 40 billion of our dollars going over there.
[02:40:58.041 --> 02:41:00.282]  And then you heard Hillary Clinton say,
[02:41:01.676 --> 02:41:04.699]  It has to be a orderly transition.
[02:41:04.699 --> 02:41:08.002]  They have to get their roles together, the voting roles.
[02:41:08.002 --> 02:41:12.866]  So now, you're hearing champions for democracy.
[02:41:12.866 --> 02:41:17.871]  I've never seen, that's the engineering, is this hypocrisy.
[02:41:17.871 --> 02:41:20.874]  The hypocrisy coming out of Washington.
[02:41:20.874 --> 02:41:23.877]  They supported this guy for 30 years.
[02:41:23.877 --> 02:41:27.100]  And here's the other thing that everybody should really be furious at.
[02:41:27.620 --> 02:41:30.622]  We were mentioning about Obama's new budget.
[02:41:30.622 --> 02:41:33.523]  Was it about $50 billion going into foreign aid?
[02:41:33.523 --> 02:41:35.885]  Let me tell you what foreign aid is.
[02:41:35.885 --> 02:41:39.887]  Foreign aid is your money that you work for every day.
[02:41:39.887 --> 02:41:47.171]  They take it out of your pocket and then they send it to their buddies overseas that they want to do deals with.
[02:41:47.171 --> 02:41:48.292]  That's all it is.
[02:41:48.292 --> 02:41:49.493]  Grow up about this.
[02:41:50.453 --> 02:41:56.997]  So let's stop this foreign aid baloney because Egypt got 40 billion of ours.
[02:41:56.997 --> 02:41:58.398]  What is Israel getting?
[02:41:58.398 --> 02:42:00.399]  3 billion plus a year.
[02:42:00.399 --> 02:42:02.360]  I don't want my money going anywhere.
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:03.361]  How about this?
[02:42:03.361 --> 02:42:05.522]  How about sending it to Detroit?
[02:42:05.522 --> 02:42:06.863]  There's a war zone.
[02:42:08.430 --> 02:42:10.391]  Well, meanwhile, we have U.S.
[02:42:10.391 --> 02:42:11.933]  troops being shot at, U.S.
[02:42:11.933 --> 02:42:13.233]  police being killed, U.S.
[02:42:13.233 --> 02:42:15.495]  diplomats, U.S.
[02:42:15.495 --> 02:42:18.277]  ICE agents, and the media is not worried about that.
[02:42:18.277 --> 02:42:19.758]  The government's not worried about that.
[02:42:19.758 --> 02:42:22.480]  Mexican troops now coming across the U.S.
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:26.543]  border and searching citizens at checkpoints.
[02:42:26.543 --> 02:42:30.606]  But we have telescreens going in Walmart telling us, spy on our neighbors.
[02:42:30.606 --> 02:42:37.390]  They're now going to have Homeland Security announcements during NBA basketball games trying to make Janet Napolitano some type of
[02:42:38.411 --> 02:42:40.113]  Rock star.
[02:42:40.113 --> 02:42:42.795]  We have just all of this going on.
[02:42:42.795 --> 02:42:44.697]  TSA robbing people.
[02:42:44.697 --> 02:42:49.441]  It's just, it really is scary how corrupt this society is going.
[02:42:49.441 --> 02:42:55.286]  Summing it up, where do you see America in a month, six months, a year, two years?
[02:42:55.286 --> 02:43:00.410]  I mean, you've talked about revolution, tax rebellions.
[02:43:00.410 --> 02:43:02.412]  You talked about it years before it came.
[02:43:02.412 --> 02:43:03.633]  Now it's starting.
[02:43:03.633 --> 02:43:04.534]  Where do you see it going?
[02:43:05.219 --> 02:43:07.220]  Well, on the one hand, it's what you're talking about.
[02:43:07.220 --> 02:43:09.600]  They're going to clamp down on us more and more.
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:10.760]  Again, the hypocrisy.
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:16.162]  Hillary Clinton talking about the freedom of the internet while they're clamping down on this end.
[02:43:16.162 --> 02:43:22.724]  And in the Trends Journal, there's that wonderful piece in the Winter Edition by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Lost of Liberty.
[02:43:22.724 --> 02:43:23.764]  That's where it's going.
[02:43:24.324 --> 02:43:29.887]  So it's hard to say if there's going to be revolts in this country, because we see the hypocrisy.
[02:43:29.887 --> 02:43:37.531]  As they were talking about, let the people in Egypt revolt, you know, don't, don't, you know, come down on the journalists.
[02:43:37.531 --> 02:43:38.912]  What do they do in this country?
[02:43:39.372 --> 02:43:44.735]  Look what happened at the G20 meetings in Pittsburgh a few years ago.
[02:43:44.735 --> 02:43:46.656]  They closed down the whole city.
[02:43:46.656 --> 02:43:49.637]  You couldn't protest all those goon squads.
[02:43:49.637 --> 02:43:50.978]  Maybe they should bring in the Egyptian goon squad.
[02:43:50.978 --> 02:43:57.521]  And it turned out in Canada the police were lying when they said no protest allowed, that a special law had been passed.
[02:43:57.521 --> 02:43:58.802]  Turned out they were just lying.
[02:43:59.102 --> 02:44:00.263]  Here's USA Today.
[02:44:00.263 --> 02:44:04.046]  Killswitch internet bill alarms privacy experts.
[02:44:04.046 --> 02:44:10.091]  The government's openly saying they want to be able to shut the internet off and they're getting ready to launch a false flag against the web.
[02:44:10.091 --> 02:44:11.572]  There's no doubt about that.
[02:44:11.572 --> 02:44:12.513]  No doubt about it.
[02:44:12.513 --> 02:44:15.495]  They're going to launch a bigger false flag.
[02:44:15.495 --> 02:44:17.237]  It's going to be terrorism or war.
[02:44:17.237 --> 02:44:18.397]  Mark my words.
[02:44:18.397 --> 02:44:26.344]  Yeah, let's for anybody that has a attention deficit disorder or suffering from Alzheimer's disease or living in
[02:44:26.604 --> 02:44:29.547]  You know, a little kid that can't put it together?
[02:44:29.547 --> 02:44:30.828]  Remember the main?
[02:44:30.828 --> 02:44:37.513]  Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al-Qaeda.
[02:44:37.513 --> 02:44:39.875]  Oh, here's one for you.
[02:44:39.875 --> 02:44:41.297]  The Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:44:41.297 --> 02:44:43.138]  Remember that beautiful lie?
[02:44:43.138 --> 02:44:45.280]  They'll lie about anything.
[02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:47.061]  They'll take you to war.
[02:44:47.061 --> 02:44:50.845]  And this is what we wrote about Alex back in
[02:44:52.486 --> 02:44:55.908]  2008, when the whole bailout scams began.
[02:44:55.908 --> 02:45:01.892]  We said when the bailout bubbles burst, the next stop is war.
[02:45:01.892 --> 02:45:07.495]  We're heading toward the first great war of the 21st century.
[02:45:07.495 --> 02:45:09.537]  You mentioned about the Czarette.
[02:45:10.177 --> 02:45:19.923]  Janet Napolitano, that bureaucratic, you know, she knows a lot about security, you know, she's really on time.
[02:45:19.923 --> 02:45:22.085]  And, you know, look what they're doing.
[02:45:22.085 --> 02:45:23.426]  Look at Obama's budget.
[02:45:24.619 --> 02:45:27.940]  They're increasing homeland security.
[02:45:27.940 --> 02:45:29.301]  They're not cutting defense.
[02:45:29.301 --> 02:45:37.405]  That's right, they announced tens of billions of dollars for more naked body scanners to roll out on the streets, the courthouses, everywhere.
[02:45:37.405 --> 02:45:40.466]  Everywhere in the cities, in the states.
[02:45:40.466 --> 02:45:45.488]  More money to control you and me.
[02:45:45.488 --> 02:45:47.269]  That's all this is about.
[02:45:47.269 --> 02:45:50.811]  As they lose control, they take more control.
[02:45:50.811 --> 02:45:52.612]  Let's look more at the budget.
[02:45:52.612 --> 02:45:53.132]  Defense.
[02:45:53.792 --> 02:45:54.934]  They're cutting defense.
[02:45:54.934 --> 02:45:55.534]  I love it.
[02:45:55.534 --> 02:45:57.617]  They go $78 billion.
[02:45:57.617 --> 02:45:58.238]  Then you read it.
[02:45:58.238 --> 02:46:01.081]  $78 billion over five years.
[02:46:01.081 --> 02:46:02.323]  So what are we talking about?
[02:46:02.323 --> 02:46:03.424]  $15 billion?
[02:46:03.424 --> 02:46:07.770]  Now let's add in some inflation into that.
[02:46:07.770 --> 02:46:09.712]  They're increasing the defense budget.
[02:46:10.493 --> 02:46:19.077]  So what they're doing is, they're taking the money and they're putting it more into apparatuses that control us more.
[02:46:19.077 --> 02:46:23.279]  So when you ask me, what is it going to look like?
[02:46:23.279 --> 02:46:29.602]  They're going to control us more and more and clamp down on dissent more and more.
[02:46:29.602 --> 02:46:30.843]  On the financial end,
[02:46:32.573 --> 02:46:37.177]  We had warned, as other people have, about the rampant inflation.
[02:46:37.177 --> 02:46:39.899]  You mentioned the UK 4%.
[02:46:39.899 --> 02:46:43.381]  You look what's going on in India, in China.
[02:46:43.381 --> 02:46:46.063]  What are these protests about?
[02:46:46.063 --> 02:46:48.505]  People can't put food in their mouth.
[02:46:48.505 --> 02:46:54.149]  Food prices are at all-time highs and they're earning all-time lows.
[02:46:54.149 --> 02:46:57.771]  The reason, the reason for this inflation
[02:46:59.036 --> 02:47:02.938]  ...is not only supply and demand.
[02:47:02.938 --> 02:47:09.041]  It's because, kiddies, commodities are based in dollars.
[02:47:09.041 --> 02:47:15.724]  And now we have the French... ...devalue the dollar, so everything else is going up.
[02:47:15.724 --> 02:47:16.905]  They're robbing you.
[02:47:18.550 --> 02:47:23.473]  And now, Gerald, the head of the G20, the French minister, came out and said, dump the dollar.
[02:47:23.473 --> 02:47:25.515]  A month ago, Hu Jintao.
[02:47:25.515 --> 02:47:32.259]  And now that consensus is there to go ahead and get rid of the dollar in the next year or so as the world reserve currency.
[02:47:32.259 --> 02:47:38.163]  But like cockroaches, when they've been sprayed with poison, you know, they start running around even faster.
[02:47:38.163 --> 02:47:41.325]  The system is even flooding the world even that much faster.
[02:47:41.325 --> 02:47:45.968]  And we see inflation rearing its head here, which hurts people on fixed incomes.
[02:47:45.968 --> 02:47:46.468]  You name it.
[02:47:47.629 --> 02:47:50.171]  Anyway you slice it, this is going to be a disaster.
[02:47:50.171 --> 02:47:50.711]  It is.
[02:47:50.711 --> 02:47:52.953]  Oh, by the way, there's no inflation.
[02:47:52.953 --> 02:47:57.336]  Look at all those people out there that haven't gotten COLA increases.
[02:47:57.336 --> 02:47:59.938]  You know, this is the... I was on Judge Napolitano's show.
[02:47:59.938 --> 02:48:02.280]  He's one of my favorites, last week.
[02:48:02.280 --> 02:48:04.021]  I said, this is the U.S.S.A.
[02:48:04.021 --> 02:48:06.623]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[02:48:06.623 --> 02:48:08.605]  How can you say there's no inflation?
[02:48:09.212 --> 02:48:12.713]  You know, and it began under Clinton and they keep the lie going.
[02:48:12.713 --> 02:48:14.813]  There's rampant inflation.
[02:48:14.813 --> 02:48:18.674]  Anybody that works and pays for things every day.
[02:48:18.674 --> 02:48:21.154]  Again, not the billionaires and the multi-millionaires.
[02:48:21.154 --> 02:48:25.255]  You know, they don't know what the price of a gallon of gasoline is.
[02:48:25.255 --> 02:48:28.996]  So what we're seeing here is insidious inflation.
[02:48:28.996 --> 02:48:35.177]  And by the way, the Europeans are as responsible for this as the American Central Bank.
[02:48:35.677 --> 02:48:37.199]  They're doing the same thing.
[02:48:37.199 --> 02:48:39.422]  They're flooding the market with cheap money.
[02:48:39.422 --> 02:48:42.386]  Because again, I mean, I'm not making this stuff up.
[02:48:42.386 --> 02:48:43.347]  Go to Bloomberg.
[02:48:43.347 --> 02:48:44.829]  It's even there today.
[02:48:44.829 --> 02:48:49.074]  They're worried about the financiers getting haircuts.
[02:48:49.074 --> 02:48:52.218]  I mean, so they're flooding more money into the system.
[02:48:52.298 --> 02:48:55.079]  The big central banks are making record profits.
[02:48:55.079 --> 02:48:59.821]  What do you think about Ron Paul shifting gears going into this year's election?
[02:48:59.821 --> 02:49:02.682]  He won the CPAC poll two years in a row.
[02:49:02.682 --> 02:49:09.165]  They re-aired an old video of him being booed and played it on Fox and said that that's what happened this year when he won.
[02:49:09.165 --> 02:49:11.846]  I mean, this was a hoax that they ran.
[02:49:11.846 --> 02:49:13.047]  They are really scared of him.
[02:49:13.854 --> 02:49:18.956]  You know, I've been getting some emails from young people who attended that, actually.
[02:49:18.956 --> 02:49:29.261]  And one of them was very insightful, saying how the young people really don't like the Republican Party at all, and they're really Ron Paul supporters.
[02:49:29.261 --> 02:49:32.882]  And that's what the core of this country is moving toward.
[02:49:32.882 --> 02:49:35.824]  As a matter of fact, you've heard me say the phrase before.
[02:49:36.624 --> 02:49:39.005]  Progressive Libertarian.
[02:49:39.005 --> 02:49:44.246]  And a matter of fact, Judge Andrew Napolitano had on Ron Paul and Ralph Nader.
[02:49:44.246 --> 02:49:49.427]  He told me he got more responses than that show, just about from any other one.
[02:49:49.427 --> 02:49:51.308]  That's the direction.
[02:49:51.308 --> 02:49:53.868]  Progressive in terms of the environment.
[02:49:53.868 --> 02:50:05.091]  Oh, by the way, all you Obama lovers, you Wimpocrats out there, you know, you quiche-eating, grinning, and balsamic smile people,
[02:50:05.962 --> 02:50:10.064]  Obama's cutting the EPA budget by an estimated 30%.
[02:50:10.064 --> 02:50:15.126]  How's that for some more change you can't believe in?
[02:50:15.126 --> 02:50:21.249]  So what we're seeing is the revolution is going to come from these educated young people
[02:50:21.829 --> 02:50:26.813]  Who want to become involved, and they are the Ron Paul supporters.
[02:50:26.813 --> 02:50:35.580]  I'll tell you my dream ticket would be a Ron Paul, someone like a Ralph Nader, and a Secretary of State like a Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[02:50:35.580 --> 02:50:38.463]  I'm on a lot of shows, as you well know Alex.
[02:50:38.463 --> 02:50:44.448]  I respect him more than, and on the mainstream media I'm talking about, I respect him more than anybody.
[02:50:44.448 --> 02:50:45.789]  He says it like it is.
[02:50:46.069 --> 02:50:50.335]  Yeah, he said on this show that the 9-11 official story is a fraud.
[02:50:50.335 --> 02:50:52.157]  And boy, that caused quite a furor.
[02:50:52.157 --> 02:50:56.743]  We're going to come back with final ideas and points with the one and only Gerald Cilente.
[02:50:56.743 --> 02:50:57.504]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:57.504 --> 02:50:57.945]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.508 --> 02:51:05.589]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.589 --> 02:51:10.090]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.090 --> 02:51:16.251]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.251 --> 02:51:18.672]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.672 --> 02:51:24.633]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.773 --> 02:51:28.178]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.178 --> 02:51:30.060]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.060 --> 02:51:32.243]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.

[02:52:00.968 --> 02:52:02.150]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:52:02.150 --> 02:52:09.118]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:52:09.118 --> 02:52:11.681]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:52:11.681 --> 02:52:16.888]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:52:17.088 --> 02:52:20.029]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:52:20.029 --> 02:52:22.349]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:52:22.349 --> 02:52:28.650]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:52:28.650 --> 02:52:32.031]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:52:32.031 --> 02:52:37.852]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:52:37.852 --> 02:52:39.513]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:52:39.513 --> 02:52:40.813]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:52:40.813 --> 02:52:43.494]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:52:43.494 --> 02:52:44.914]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:52:45.194 --> 02:52:47.738]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:52:47.738 --> 02:52:52.304]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.

[02:54:13.772 --> 02:54:19.914]  All right, it's our final segment with Gerald Solente joining us.
[02:54:19.914 --> 02:54:30.077]  Gerald Obama last week went ahead and expanded the Security Prosperity Partnership, North American Union, to say we have a continental security perimeter using the crises in Mexico they've engineered.
[02:54:31.218 --> 02:54:34.823]  We see just continued evidence of the depression unfolding.
[02:54:34.823 --> 02:54:45.458]  In the last four minutes or so that we have left, what else do you think is most important on your radar screen or what other tidbits do you want to impart to folks right now?
[02:54:46.527 --> 02:54:49.068]  Well, this is really a time to be vigilant.
[02:54:49.068 --> 02:54:53.491]  Something we believe is going to happen of a very large magnitude.
[02:54:53.491 --> 02:54:57.113]  Again, we're not alarmists, and we're not Monday morning quarterbacks.
[02:54:57.113 --> 02:55:03.576]  We call the shots before they happen with these riots that are now taking place in Tunisia and Egypt.
[02:55:03.576 --> 02:55:04.777]  We said it.
[02:55:04.777 --> 02:55:14.882]  That it would be young people, it would be... And we said, and this time the revolution will not only be televised, it'll be Twittered, Facebooked, and YouTubed.
[02:55:15.442 --> 02:55:20.128]  And so people really need to know, watch what's going on very closely.
[02:55:20.128 --> 02:55:29.399]  And in going back to the Obama lie, and again, your Obama deception, that documentary should win awards.
[02:55:29.399 --> 02:55:33.284]  Because you really nailed it, so early on.
[02:55:33.704 --> 02:55:43.723]  And anybody that hasn't seen that, I really highly recommend that they show it to everyone that they know who still believes in the great lie.
[02:55:43.723 --> 02:55:45.486]  And here's another part of the great lie.
[02:55:46.755 --> 02:55:55.560]  When Obama became president, he said that they've earmarked $2 trillion worth of savings that they saw in the federal budget.
[02:55:55.560 --> 02:55:59.483]  Well, obviously they never came through with that because they weren't there.
[02:55:59.483 --> 02:56:03.185]  And then they said, according to the Congressional Budget Office, in 2009,
[02:56:05.086 --> 02:56:11.132]  That do you know what the deficit would be in 2011 according to their projections?
[02:56:11.132 --> 02:56:12.493]  500 billion dollars.
[02:56:12.493 --> 02:56:13.414]  What is it?
[02:56:13.414 --> 02:56:17.738]  Oh, it's estimated to be 1.6 trillion dollars.
[02:56:17.738 --> 02:56:25.006]  So the lies that are coming out right in front of our face are beyond the belief of anything that you could make up.
[02:56:25.626 --> 02:56:31.872]  And as I said, what we're most concerned about now is something is going to happen.
[02:56:31.872 --> 02:56:37.577]  A real, it's either going to be a terrorism or a call to war at some level.
[02:56:37.577 --> 02:56:44.344]  And by the way, I only saw it once, I haven't had time to follow up on it, about Petraeus leaving Afghanistan.
[02:56:44.344 --> 02:56:44.944]  Is that true?
[02:56:46.041 --> 02:56:50.983]  Well, there's calls for them to try to start pulling out and perhaps removing Petraeus.
[02:56:50.983 --> 02:56:52.784]  No, Petraeus himself leaving.
[02:56:52.784 --> 02:56:54.444]  I haven't confirmed that, no.
[02:56:54.444 --> 02:56:58.486]  Oh, because I saw something come across on that.
[02:56:58.486 --> 02:57:03.348]  And the point that I'm making is that these are losing wars.
[02:57:03.348 --> 02:57:07.510]  They're losing in Pakistan, in that CIA drone war.
[02:57:07.510 --> 02:57:10.451]  They're losing in Afghanistan.
[02:57:10.451 --> 02:57:12.452]  And there's no end in sight in Iraq.
[02:57:13.112 --> 02:57:15.235]  Something we believe is going to happen.
[02:57:15.235 --> 02:57:25.767]  So what I'm saying is that I believe when it does happen, they're going to close down the banks and they close down Wall Street when 9-11 happened.
[02:57:25.767 --> 02:57:29.051]  This time is going to be a run on cash, run on ATM.
[02:57:29.051 --> 02:57:30.733]  So I would just suggest to people
[02:57:31.374 --> 02:57:38.820]  That, you know, have your e-foods, have your survival gear in place, because if the worst doesn't- and have money on hand!
[02:57:38.820 --> 02:57:41.342]  And have your- you know, I believe in gold, as you know.
[02:57:41.342 --> 02:57:46.146]  So you're saying this depression could really accelerate and become a complete meltdown?
[02:57:46.146 --> 02:57:46.786]  Yes.
[02:57:46.786 --> 02:57:47.887]  That's all they need.
[02:57:47.887 --> 02:57:55.754]  That's all we need now is a geopolitical flashpoint, and this thing unravels, bam, the bottom falls out.
[02:57:55.754 --> 02:58:00.898]  So what I'm saying is that if the worst doesn't happen, at least you're prepared.
[02:58:01.218 --> 02:58:02.399]  Absolutely.
[02:58:02.399 --> 02:58:05.383]  In closing, David Petraeus quitting.
[02:58:05.383 --> 02:58:14.392]  The Times of London is reporting that he is going to be stepping down sometime near the end of the year, but now the Pentagon is denying that.
[02:58:14.392 --> 02:58:16.335]  So, who knows what the truth is, Gerald.
[02:58:16.795 --> 02:58:18.736]  Who knows what the truth is?
[02:58:18.736 --> 02:58:24.059]  And so the point being, if you don't prepare now, you could lose everything.
[02:58:24.059 --> 02:58:26.481]  The stock market is a rigged game.
[02:58:26.481 --> 02:58:30.443]  Only little kids believe that they could play it and win it.
[02:58:30.443 --> 02:58:36.426]  With the high frequency trading, the dark pools, everybody knows what's going on and watching it.
[02:58:36.426 --> 02:58:37.087]  Absolutely!
