[02:36.520 --> 02:44.440]  US Senate of the USA Patriot Act so he is certainly delivering on what he
[02:44.440 --> 02:48.920]  promised to do and that leads us into Congressman Ron Paul the first thing I'm
[02:48.920 --> 02:54.960]  gonna cover when we come back is not just Rand Paul but Ron Paul Fox News has
[02:54.960 --> 03:01.800]  been caught in an extremely wicked dirty trick and there really should be some
[03:01.800 --> 03:06.600]  repercussions for this if they did something deceptive like this on someone
[03:06.600 --> 03:12.160]  I don't like like Barack Obama or Dick Cheney I would be screaming and hopping
[03:12.160 --> 03:17.440]  up and down concerned but they did this to Ron Paul of course they wouldn't do
[03:17.440 --> 03:22.840]  this to Dick Cheney or Barack Obama or a fellow globalist they would only do
[03:22.840 --> 03:29.120]  this to somebody like Ron Paul they have been caught absolutely red-handed
[03:29.120 --> 03:35.840]  playing video a reportedly of Ron Paul being booed at CPAC and it's a lie it's
[03:35.840 --> 03:40.240]  a fraud it's a fake we're gonna break that down the other side and they are
[03:40.240 --> 03:47.280]  admittedly caught they have admittedly been dinged when I saw this last night I
[03:47.280 --> 03:53.040]  couldn't believe it I actually went to C-Span.org they have all of it
[03:53.040 --> 03:57.640]  archived there for free the audio and video of it and did go to the video
[03:57.640 --> 04:01.600]  where they announced the winner of the CPAC coveted poll to Ron Paul
[04:01.600 --> 04:08.560]  unbelievable standing ovation all you hear is this thunderous applause if you

[10:10.040 --> 10:13.880]  also be joining us for 30 minutes to talk about his incredible confrontation of
[10:13.880 --> 10:25.160]  Dick Cheney at C at CPAC now mentioning CPAC I do not have words to describe how
[10:25.160 --> 10:32.000]  naked the corruption of Fox News is and you know I criticize MSNBC I criticize
[10:32.000 --> 10:39.680]  CNN these groups all basically have goals via the establishment to suppress
[10:39.680 --> 10:47.400]  the population's political awakening and to basically play the population of the
[10:47.400 --> 10:53.400]  United States off against each other and that is clearly what is happening
[10:53.400 --> 10:58.480]  today CNN is more to an international audience and tries to play the middle as
[10:58.480 --> 11:06.000]  if they're nonpartisan MSNBC is filled with extreme kind of fake left
[11:06.000 --> 11:12.720]  vitriol and race baiting if you don't like government-run health care then you
[11:12.720 --> 11:21.600]  are a racist if you don't give up your guns you're a racist and then you look
[11:21.600 --> 11:27.560]  at Fox News what is Fox News there for their rhinos the Republicans in name
[11:27.560 --> 11:34.200]  only it is their job to suppress and to control the libertarian slash
[11:34.200 --> 11:40.680]  conservative movement in this country that at its roots threatens the globalist
[11:40.680 --> 11:50.400]  agenda of one-world government cashless society control grids global SDRs the
[11:50.400 --> 11:55.560]  Patriot Act the surveillance grid the military industrial complex takeover of
[11:55.560 --> 11:59.640]  this country so the Democrats bought and paid for by the same offshore slash
[11:59.640 --> 12:03.280]  Wall Street interest they're there to put out a political narrative that is
[12:03.280 --> 12:08.160]  attractive and manipulative towards people that see themselves as leftist
[12:08.160 --> 12:16.240]  Fox News is there to kind of keep Republicans on the mainline fake plastic
[12:16.240 --> 12:22.760]  conservative front and they're also there of course to continue that left
[12:22.760 --> 12:33.200]  right paradigm Balkanization division that we talk so much about now
[12:33.200 --> 12:40.600]  illustrating this is the fact that for decades Rush Limbaugh and for the last
[12:40.600 --> 12:46.640]  decade or so Fox television Fox News have made endless jokes about people that
[12:46.640 --> 12:50.520]  are worried about a police state people that don't like the private fellow
[12:50.520 --> 12:54.960]  reserve people that criticize the council on foreign relations when all of
[12:54.960 --> 12:59.880]  these organizations openly are pushing for your government and true patriots
[12:59.880 --> 13:03.560]  that are aware of this threat have been covering it and trying to warn the
[13:03.560 --> 13:12.320]  people so for as long as they could Fox News tried to paint anyone that talked
[13:12.320 --> 13:21.520]  about real issues with a tinfoil hat paintbrush but in the last three or four
[13:21.520 --> 13:27.120]  years there have been so many AP and Financial Times of London and Newsweek
[13:27.120 --> 13:32.040]  and Time Magazine articles and so many open announcements by the G20 and the
[13:32.040 --> 13:37.520]  United Nations that indeed a private world government is being established
[13:37.520 --> 13:45.400]  that indeed a system of planetary corporate rule is being created that
[13:45.400 --> 13:50.720]  indeed a program of forced world population reduction in one child
[13:50.720 --> 13:56.480]  policy is real so it's gone from academic papers and the geopolitical
[13:56.480 --> 14:00.920]  preparations for this and the unification of laws the continuity of
[14:00.920 --> 14:10.280]  agenda to now the attempt to accelerate the implementation of this and so Fox
[14:10.280 --> 14:17.680]  has gone from saying none of this exist to having Dick Morris on routinely on
[14:17.680 --> 14:23.760]  shows like Hannity and he says yes the conspiracy theorists were nuts saying
[14:23.760 --> 14:27.280]  it was a plan for a world government and a world currency but now they're right
[14:27.280 --> 14:33.720]  and they put Glenn Beck out to basically cover that niche of awakening
[14:33.720 --> 14:39.240]  libertarians and conservatives but only so they have your confidence when they
[14:39.240 --> 14:43.280]  bring in the next Messianic Republican leader which is any major Republican
[14:43.280 --> 14:49.240]  presidential contender other than Ron Paul and I take you back to CNN and Fox
[14:49.240 --> 14:55.600]  going back three years ago on CNN the last two years with Glenn Beck on his own
[14:55.600 --> 15:02.360]  radio show and TV he'll have Glenn Glenn Beck will have Ron Paul on he will say
[15:02.360 --> 15:07.200]  he's a good guy and then call him a kook right after it or he'll say Ron Paul
[15:07.200 --> 15:11.680]  supporters want a money bomb they may want to blow things up they might be
[15:11.680 --> 15:15.000]  terrorists the army may need to be used against them you don't know about that
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.520]  clip just pull it up Glenn Beck says army may need to be used against Ron
[15:18.520 --> 15:23.040]  Paul supporters he says the army may need to be used against these domestic
[15:23.040 --> 15:29.080]  threats so we have all of that going on and we have Fox News famously with
[15:29.080 --> 15:34.240]  people they don't like taking photos of them changing the color to a green or
[15:34.240 --> 15:41.280]  yellow hue deforming the faces they've been caught a lot doing this and and you
[15:41.280 --> 15:44.960]  really get to see who the system's afraid of when the Democrats are out
[15:44.960 --> 15:48.720]  there saying Ron Paul can't win even though he's won CPAC two years in a row
[15:48.720 --> 15:53.200]  and is winning most scientific polls as the number one slot right now as the
[15:53.200 --> 15:57.760]  presidential contender the best chance to beat Barack Obama in some polls it
[15:57.760 --> 16:00.880]  still meant Romney but most polls Ron Paul's number one and the other polls
[16:00.880 --> 16:07.680]  he's number two so you've got people like Trump saying he can't win creating
[16:07.680 --> 16:14.240]  this shelf-fulfilling prophecy but right after Ron Paul won the CPAC poll
[16:14.240 --> 16:22.640]  Fox News knowingly cut to last year and a staged Mitt Romney event where they
[16:22.640 --> 16:27.920]  booed him and that was staged last year where Fox had their microphone in the
[16:27.920 --> 16:33.880]  Mitt Romney contingent so that it would sound like they were over booing the
[16:33.880 --> 16:39.680]  cheers for Ron Paul when he won that was staged and came out last year this is
[16:39.680 --> 16:45.920]  even worse this year they ignored the live c-span feed or their own live feed
[16:45.920 --> 16:50.160]  with the same guy announcing that in the same background from last year and
[16:50.160 --> 16:57.280]  they played last year's feed of Ron Paul being booed and then put Ron Paul on
[16:57.280 --> 17:01.880]  live and said what do you think of them just booing you and Ron Paul said well
[17:01.880 --> 17:08.420]  I didn't see it so I don't know this is a hoax this is Fox News insulting their
[17:08.420 --> 17:14.120]  listeners treating you like you're a complete and total absolute moron and
[17:14.120 --> 17:20.960]  they cannot be trusted at any level and it's despicable the people want Ron Paul
[17:20.960 --> 17:25.760]  if the media even halfway acknowledges this he will be the next president of
[17:25.760 --> 17:30.440]  the United States a guy who's never compromised as a perfect voting record
[17:30.440 --> 17:33.240]  who will risk his life you better believe they're gonna come after him
[17:33.240 --> 17:38.680]  physically to try to abolish the Federal Reserve and restore the Republic and what
[17:38.680 --> 17:43.600]  is Fox News do they run a shy off hoax and they've not responded to this I
[17:43.600 --> 17:50.640]  demand that they respond to this I demand that you put pressure on them I've
[17:50.640 --> 17:54.080]  never called for boycotts of Fox I've actually said that we shouldn't let
[17:54.080 --> 17:59.400]  media matters try to bankrupt blend back but at a certain point we've got to use
[17:59.400 --> 18:03.320]  our financial power against them I mean I don't do you as listeners have other
[18:03.320 --> 18:10.800]  ideas of what we can do about this enough is enough is enough is enough they
[18:10.800 --> 18:14.840]  think you're weak-minded they think if they show you people booing Ron Paul
[18:14.840 --> 18:18.720]  that you'll think well he's not popular I won't get behind him and they think
[18:18.720 --> 18:23.160]  you're so weak-minded that if they tell you he can't win they can then cheat him
[18:23.160 --> 18:27.240]  at the electronic voting machine boxes in the primaries they can defeat him
[18:27.240 --> 18:31.480]  coming up they think they can create that mindset well I would vote for Ron
[18:31.480 --> 18:36.880]  Paul but he can't win he's winning the Gallup polls multiple polls he gets
[18:36.880 --> 18:42.200]  first or second place behind Mitt Romney Mitt Romney was a supporter of

[23:56.920 --> 24:14.000]  and body extract
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.040]  here's another example of what I'm talking about driving in this morning
[24:18.040 --> 24:25.040]  listening to local radio Genesis on a local station I heard the SRN radio news
[24:25.040 --> 24:29.560]  that they carry and they talked about CPAC and didn't even mention Ron Paul
[24:29.560 --> 24:34.080]  the winner that's another way mainline Republicans and that's what basically
[24:34.080 --> 24:38.160]  runs SRN and I guess it's better than some of the other stuff we could carry
[24:38.160 --> 24:42.120]  but I'm told Teddy should just produce his own news for stations in fact maybe
[24:42.120 --> 24:45.280]  I should just set that up in my office we can outdo what they're doing any day
[24:45.280 --> 24:50.520]  would just dry focus news and you just hear the propaganda laced in there where
[24:50.520 --> 24:59.240]  they take you as a listener as a moron and they deceive you and talk about CPAC
[24:59.240 --> 25:03.240]  and don't even tell you who the winner is when that's the whole point of it
[25:03.240 --> 25:07.720]  that'd be like having a newscast about the Kentucky Derby 30 minutes after it
[25:07.720 --> 25:12.600]  finishes you know on Saturday morning or whenever they have it and then not
[25:12.600 --> 25:18.760]  telling you what horse won now what Fox News did is even worse that's deception
[25:18.760 --> 25:23.600]  by omission Fox News showed a clip from last year and that was a scandal too it
[25:23.600 --> 25:27.600]  was all-stage they had a microphone in the Little Mitt Romney contingent he had
[25:27.600 --> 25:32.160]  lost he was angry and so Fox News cut to it with with the microphone in the
[25:32.160 --> 25:37.280]  crowd show that you with the directional mic only heard those around it so it
[25:37.280 --> 25:42.040]  sounded like Ron Paul got booed this year the the cheering was so overwhelming
[25:42.040 --> 25:47.760]  for Ron Paul they just didn't show you that and they showed you last year with
[25:47.760 --> 25:51.600]  the same master of ceremonies so we're first gonna play you what actually
[25:51.600 --> 25:55.960]  happened last week when they announced Ron Paul as the winner and you'll hear
[25:55.960 --> 25:59.960]  the sustained total cheering then we're gonna go back to the start of the video
[25:59.960 --> 26:04.360]  if you want to see it all for yourself it's Fox News caught in shocking dirty
[26:04.360 --> 26:10.320]  trick stunt against Ron Paul and that's up on prisonplanet.com and info wars.com
[26:10.320 --> 26:14.640]  and this needs to be gotten out to all Fox News listeners and viewers show that
[26:14.640 --> 26:18.960]  pressure is put on Fox so they don't continue to engage in dirty tricks like
[26:18.960 --> 26:22.760]  this not just against Ron Paul but against the electorate and against their
[26:22.760 --> 26:29.880]  viewers this is outrageous so here's what really happened at CPAC here it is
[26:29.880 --> 26:36.200]  it is the results of the presidential straw ball and this year probably was
[26:36.200 --> 26:40.920]  one of the longer lists we've ever had and we had a number of writing
[26:40.920 --> 26:44.760]  candidates which I'll touch on when I show the results and we asked this year
[26:44.760 --> 26:48.400]  we asked it two ways we asked it as a first choice and we asked it as a second
[26:48.400 --> 26:55.440]  choice and I'll show the combination of both and the next slide the winner of
[26:55.440 --> 27:14.080]  the straw Paul this year
[27:14.080 --> 27:20.800]  you can't even say Ron Paul they're so loud standing ovation this is what
[27:20.800 --> 27:26.480]  really happened last Friday
[27:30.440 --> 27:36.000]  chanting Ron Paul okay
[27:37.520 --> 27:43.640]  this is what really happened the Fox News won't let you see it because they know
[27:43.640 --> 27:58.840]  the best for you okay Congressman Congressman Ron Paul gets 30% former
[27:58.840 --> 28:05.080]  Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney
[28:05.080 --> 28:12.360]  gets 23% here the booze and as you can see there are a number of candidates
[28:12.360 --> 28:17.080]  that's enough so you hear about half of it is booing for Mitt Romney you can
[28:17.080 --> 28:20.760]  almost hear no booing for Ron Paul you have the one Mitt Romney corner doing it
[28:20.760 --> 28:24.600]  I guess Fox couldn't get a microphone snaked over to that area right in the
[28:24.600 --> 28:28.040]  mouth of one of the Mitt Romney supporters to boo to drown out everybody
[28:28.040 --> 28:31.480]  else and so Fox just said you know what get Ron Paul on right after the
[28:31.480 --> 28:36.000]  announcement they get Ron Paul on and the Fox News host we're gonna come back
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.360]  from break and play this says hey you got booed what do you think of that and
[28:39.360 --> 28:45.720]  they show the video from the year before and what a difference the only one by a
[28:45.720 --> 28:50.120]  few percentage points last year he beat Romney by a whole bunch of points as you
[28:50.120 --> 28:57.640]  just heard this year and you heard the just deafening standing ovation you
[28:57.640 --> 29:02.400]  can barely hear some booze from the Mitt Romney crowd and Fox News they just
[29:02.400 --> 29:09.880]  decided you don't get to hear it you don't get to see it they're gonna engage
[29:09.880 --> 29:15.320]  in fraud they're gonna engage in a hoax they're gonna engage in lies they're
[29:15.320 --> 29:22.240]  going to keep you from being able to actually hear what people had to say for
[29:22.240 --> 29:28.760]  Ron Paul he also won the poll of course but remember how he kept winning the
[29:28.760 --> 29:32.800]  text votes and all the debates and the media would then either ignore it or
[29:32.800 --> 29:37.400]  would say oh well this is ridiculous you see Ron Paul was proven right two and a
[29:37.400 --> 29:41.120]  half three years ago in that campaign and the system is now very very scared
[29:41.120 --> 29:45.200]  we'll show you the fraud when we come back right here on the GCN Radio Network

[33:03.920 --> 33:08.440]  the central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance you're
[33:08.440 --> 33:19.200]  listening to the Alex Jones show okay so you just heard the audio and if you're
[33:19.200 --> 33:24.760]  watching prison pota.tv the video heard and saw the video of what really
[33:24.760 --> 33:29.720]  happened last Friday when Ron Paul won the coveted CPAC poll which Reagan won
[33:29.720 --> 33:35.360]  and catapulted him in in 79 and that's so many other people that end up winning
[33:35.360 --> 33:40.000]  the Republican nomination have won as well and last year Fox said well the
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.320]  straw poll doesn't really count anymore and this year they just lied and played
[33:45.320 --> 33:50.080]  an old tape saying Ron Paul got booed that's what they think of you I'm gonna
[33:50.080 --> 33:54.640]  play that in a moment but I mean look Fox News is pushing this hard and so
[33:54.640 --> 33:59.720]  we're all the other camp followers again radio news that I mentioned earlier
[33:59.720 --> 34:04.280]  that even this network carries we don't produce it just mention the straw
[34:04.280 --> 34:07.960]  poll and didn't even mention Ron Paul the winner it's like mentioning the
[34:07.960 --> 34:13.000]  Super Bowl right after it is over and not saying who won this is what they
[34:13.000 --> 34:18.520]  think of you then they say disrespectful libertarians hijack CPAC poll and its
[34:18.520 --> 34:23.400]  mission and they go on here to not even really clearly tell you that Ron Paul
[34:23.400 --> 34:33.840]  won and then they demonize him and say that well it's just a bunch of fluff
[34:33.840 --> 34:37.120]  doesn't even make sense it says it is the libertarians in attendance that
[34:37.120 --> 34:43.680]  produced the free pornographic calendar passed out to attendees in 2010 so
[34:43.680 --> 34:46.740]  somebody handed something out so they blame all libertarians it is the
[34:46.740 --> 34:50.840]  libertarians in attendance who openly promote the inclusion of groups like
[34:50.840 --> 34:56.000]  GOP round largely as an attempt to silence groups who speak in strong
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.080]  opposition traditional moral values so again the idea is because somebody
[35:00.080 --> 35:06.440]  shows up and talks about something it's Ron Paul's fault see how they and the
[35:06.440 --> 35:12.920]  whole thing is just a giant demonization campaign that that the gays are
[35:12.920 --> 35:16.600]  gonna get us if we vote for Ron Paul when that's not even one of Ron Paul's
[35:16.600 --> 35:22.400]  issues and meanwhile you know it's the Republicans leadership at Bohemian
[35:22.400 --> 35:27.560]  Grove shipping in the male prostitutes and who's reported on that New York
[35:27.560 --> 35:34.360]  Daily News New York Post Vanity Fair just two years ago Vanity Fair reporter
[35:34.360 --> 35:38.840]  snuck in there and witnessed it all he got arrested but still he's a reporter
[35:38.840 --> 35:43.880]  so they couldn't erase his brain all of what he saw was there spy magazine back
[35:43.880 --> 35:48.640]  in the 80s reported on it I mean come on Richard Nixon told Harper's magazine
[35:48.640 --> 35:54.760]  that it's a giant homosexual orgy so come on guys Republicans are telling us
[35:54.760 --> 35:58.280]  that they're so afraid of the gays that are gonna come out from under the table
[35:58.280 --> 36:03.080]  and get them but meanwhile we all know that the mainline rhinos you basically
[36:03.080 --> 36:06.480]  have to be a homosexual to be a high-powered mainline Republican and
[36:06.480 --> 36:11.560]  Ron Paul isn't we all saw what happened with Barat they tell him it's a German
[36:11.560 --> 36:15.760]  TV interview they tell him please step in this room while we fix the fix the
[36:15.760 --> 36:21.360]  lights and Barat playing the part of Bruno start stripping his clothes down
[36:21.360 --> 36:25.640]  and Ron Paul shoves him out of the door and screams at him and you know he's
[36:25.640 --> 36:29.280]  completely freaked out running out of the room now that would have been one of
[36:29.280 --> 36:32.800]  your other mainline Republicans that would have been a full-on sex scene with
[36:32.800 --> 36:37.720]  Bruno no doubt I mean it had been boom absolute you know what going down so
[36:37.720 --> 36:40.640]  they're mad at Ron Paul he doesn't join the club he doesn't go into airport
[36:40.640 --> 36:47.340]  bathrooms he's not you know being found with dead interns like you know so many
[36:47.340 --> 36:52.720]  people that are big mainline Republicans one of them is a host on MSNBC in
[36:52.720 --> 36:58.120]  the morning but oh my gosh they just want to protect us they just want to
[36:58.120 --> 37:05.480]  protect us our and it goes on and on so I already played for you the audio and
[37:05.480 --> 37:09.040]  video of what really happened last Friday imagine how dumb they think you
[37:09.040 --> 37:13.840]  are it's on c-span it's live on other channels and they have the dirty trick
[37:13.840 --> 37:17.440]  ready they go back and get last year which itself was a staged event with
[37:17.440 --> 37:23.120]  the microphone in into the Fox feed shoved up in the Mitt Romney gaggle the
[37:23.120 --> 37:30.280]  Mitt Romney group that's kind of like the famous roar of then presidential
[37:30.280 --> 37:37.000]  candidate Howard Dean back in back in 2000 what year was that election back in
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.480]  2004 where he's got the you know the microphone that I guess they call it a
[37:42.480 --> 37:48.440]  cardioid projection where it only picks up what's right on your mouth and so
[37:48.440 --> 37:52.240]  he's yelling and roaring why everybody else is cheering and it sounds like he's
[37:52.240 --> 37:58.480]  crazy because all you hear is him roaring and they spun all that like oh
[37:58.480 --> 38:03.040]  look he's a maniac well it's the same thing a year ago a year and five days
[38:03.040 --> 38:07.600]  ago at CPAC this came out then we wrote articles about it ran a microphone over
[38:07.600 --> 38:11.920]  they had it all staged okay when Ron Paul wins which they already knew from
[38:11.920 --> 38:15.560]  inside baseball things run by the Republicans was gonna happen you guys
[38:15.560 --> 38:19.120]  cheer into the microphone when Mitt Romney you know gets up second but when
[38:19.120 --> 38:23.520]  Ron Paul gets up you boo well that I guess they couldn't pull that off this
[38:23.520 --> 38:29.640]  year so knowing it's the same guy that presented last year that presents this
[38:29.640 --> 38:34.560]  year as he's done for over a decade at CPAC they go ahead and say well it's the
[38:34.560 --> 38:38.840]  same background same guy let's go ahead and bait and switch our viewers are so
[38:38.840 --> 38:44.520]  stupid and so addled that they won't figure out what's happening okay let's
[38:44.520 --> 38:50.360]  go ahead now and play the hoax video from Fox News as they try to embarrass
[38:50.360 --> 38:58.640]  Ron Paul on air here it is this is the setup interval he came out of nowhere
[38:58.640 --> 39:02.960]  and he won the Republican straw poll Ron Paul and named by conservatives as
[39:02.960 --> 39:08.840]  their favorite to run for president at CPAC but reaction not exactly warm and
[39:08.840 --> 39:18.120]  fuzzy now for the deception the winner of this year's CPAC straw poll
[39:18.120 --> 39:35.720]  it now okay well the winner of this year's CPAC straw poll is Texas
[39:35.720 --> 39:43.240]  congressman Ron Paul in the end he was the winner probably not the reaction he
[39:43.240 --> 39:46.520]  was hoping for when you name it favorite to run for the White House mixed applause
[39:46.520 --> 39:51.080]  and booze as Ron Paul was announced over the weekend the fiery Texas Republican
[39:51.080 --> 39:56.520]  no doubt unfazed by the reaction he's live with me now from Capitol Hill winner
[39:56.520 --> 40:00.160]  of that straw poll for the second year in a row how you doing sir Congress I'm
[40:00.160 --> 40:06.160]  fine welcome back thank you who was in the who was in the audience booing you
[40:06.160 --> 40:11.080]  did you get a name on the head did you get an ID in those people no I wasn't
[40:11.080 --> 40:15.800]  there so I didn't watch that little ceremony at the end but it tells you
[40:15.800 --> 40:21.200]  that there's no people are unanimous on this cause of liberty you know I am a
[40:21.200 --> 40:25.120]  very determined that liberty is the issue and some people like to be taken
[40:25.120 --> 40:30.760]  care of more so than demanding their freedoms but maybe it was so it's not
[40:30.760 --> 40:34.800]  about Ron Paul's issues it's not about Ron Paul's ideas it's not about him
[40:34.800 --> 40:38.440]  winning Gallup polls that are scientific being in first or second place in
[40:38.440 --> 40:42.160]  multiple polls it's not about him winning the coveted straw poll two years in a
[40:42.160 --> 40:47.160]  row it's not about staged booze last year and now no booze you can hear in
[40:47.160 --> 40:53.040]  standing ovation this year it's all about he got booed which itself is a
[40:53.040 --> 40:57.280]  fraud and is a lie now regardless of what you think of Ron Paul whether you're
[40:57.280 --> 41:03.000]  Democrat Republican independent whatever the case may be what should happen to
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.720]  Fox News I mean we should talk about it we should say it's wrong we should speak
[41:07.720 --> 41:13.400]  out against it I mean they crafted this they aired this days after that
[41:13.400 --> 41:17.000]  announcement made they got this ready they got Ron Paul ready for the show
[41:17.000 --> 41:24.280]  and they knowingly lied to their viewers and look I know the media spins and
[41:24.280 --> 41:31.200]  lies bios you know by omission now now now there is this year there is the
[41:31.200 --> 41:35.760]  fellow announcing the winners this year and you notice he's wearing a
[41:35.760 --> 41:42.760]  different shirt and does not have a lanyard around his neck but the same
[41:42.760 --> 41:45.480]  background the same American flag background they use last year's what
[41:45.480 --> 41:49.600]  they use this year and then again if you're watching on prison planet TV you
[41:49.600 --> 41:53.280]  can see this if not go to infowars.com and prison planet.com you can see the
[41:53.280 --> 41:56.760]  video for yourself Fox caught in shocking dirty tricks done against Ron Paul
[41:56.760 --> 42:01.920]  that was this year and then there's last year a little bit different shirt a
[42:01.920 --> 42:09.880]  little bit different jacket and he's got a blue lanyard around his neck so what
[42:09.880 --> 42:16.760]  is Fox News going to do caught trying to deceive their viewers I mean does that
[42:16.760 --> 42:21.040]  make people happy do do you like that we're gonna open the phones up and I
[42:21.040 --> 42:24.400]  want to get your take on this issue and all the other issues that I've already
[42:24.400 --> 42:30.840]  you know basically skimmed over the toll-free number to join us is 800-25 at
[42:30.840 --> 42:38.680]  9-9231-800-25 at 9-9231 we'll get you up and on the air then I'm gonna get
[42:38.680 --> 42:43.360]  into all of the other incredible news that we have here on Egypt on the
[42:43.360 --> 42:50.240]  economy on Bernie Madoff on poison toxic products killing kids on the
[42:50.240 --> 42:56.080]  internet kill switch alarms privacy experts USA today that is all coming up
[42:56.080 --> 43:02.800]  but I'm asking you the listeners specifically you can talk about whatever
[43:02.800 --> 43:05.800]  you want here we don't screen your calls it's wide open phones for first-time
[43:05.800 --> 43:08.720]  callers in this first hour and then a little bit of the next hour that will
[43:08.720 --> 43:13.680]  be wide open for everybody but I mean does this anger you I mean if we just
[43:13.680 --> 43:17.560]  gotten to the point where we just accept being manipulated and being deceived
[43:17.560 --> 43:20.320]  it's one thing of media makes a mistake or it's one thing of media gets their
[43:20.320 --> 43:23.840]  facts wrong sometimes nobody's perfect everybody does that it's another thing
[43:23.840 --> 43:29.200]  that Fox has this long history of crafted hoaxes and deception just like
[43:29.200 --> 43:34.760]  Rachel Maddow got up with Rand Paul he had about a two-second delay on the
[43:34.760 --> 43:38.320]  satellite she said are you forgetting read of the Civil Rights Act and he
[43:38.320 --> 43:45.720]  said yes I can't hear you hold on yes say it again no no I'm not forgetting
[43:45.720 --> 43:50.480]  rid of that and they put a transcript out cutting out the yes yes now I can
[43:50.480 --> 43:56.880]  hear you to do you agree with getting rid of the Civil Rights Act yes I do when
[43:56.880 --> 44:01.000]  clearly we played the video here he said hold on I didn't hear you yes what was
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.520]  that they say it again no no I'm not forgetting rid of it and they said he
[44:05.520 --> 44:09.040]  kidnapped a woman they said he wasn't really a medical doctor but see that
[44:09.040 --> 44:14.760]  backfired on him but see Fox still has a lot of conservatives trusting them MSNBC
[44:14.760 --> 44:18.680]  lost their trust that's why their biggest shows have half a million viewers
[44:18.680 --> 44:24.280]  some nights maybe a million most their shows about a quarter million I mean a
[44:24.280 --> 44:29.160]  big radio station a major city has that many listeners per hour it's a joke it's
[44:29.160 --> 44:35.880]  a fraud it's a hoax and we should though still be happy because the fact that
[44:35.880 --> 44:41.280]  Fox has to pose as patriots shows how far we've come the fact that we forced
[44:41.280 --> 44:45.480]  them to cover world government the fact that we forced them to cover SDRs and
[44:45.480 --> 44:50.720]  cashless grids the fact that we've gone this far is amazing and is extremely
[44:50.720 --> 44:58.720]  extremely extremely exciting okay let's go ahead now and take some calls here
[44:58.720 --> 45:03.280]  let's talk to Jason in Texas Jason you're on the air
[45:04.160 --> 45:12.840]  hello yes Jason can you turn your radio off yes sir I'm a big fan of yours man
[45:12.840 --> 45:18.000]  that really makes me very angry about the long call thing I had a quick
[45:18.000 --> 45:24.800]  question I was gonna ask you can you hear me yes sir I live just north of you
[45:24.800 --> 45:29.240]  in Temple Texas and the snow that we got a while back out it seems like I'm the
[45:29.240 --> 45:35.280]  only one that noticed it the there was a red residue in the snow that covered
[45:35.280 --> 45:41.160]  every single vehicle and the local news is saying it was the rock salt they put
[45:41.160 --> 45:45.360]  down the road to melt the ice but my truck was covered in snow in my back
[45:45.360 --> 45:49.360]  yard and it had that red film residue over it and I wanted to get a sample of
[45:49.360 --> 45:54.400]  it and get it tested but I don't have much money well I mean the the
[45:54.400 --> 45:59.720]  statistically it's there is weather modification there is bizarre chemical
[45:59.720 --> 46:04.400]  biological spring testing going on everywhere all over the world that's
[46:04.400 --> 46:07.960]  admitted most of it classified but they admit the programs are going on but
[46:07.960 --> 46:12.800]  routinely growing up in Texas and it's the same all over the country dust
[46:12.800 --> 46:17.680]  circles in the jet stream around the world and there's the Mongolian Desert
[46:17.680 --> 46:23.080]  that has red dirt northern Mexico has red dirt there's all sorts of dust storms
[46:23.080 --> 46:29.040]  that blow all over the world and so a lot of times snow when it's falling even
[46:29.040 --> 46:35.800]  more than water will basically get coated and will pick up dust that's in the
[46:35.800 --> 46:41.960]  air and then deposited on your back lawn so that's probably probably what
[46:41.960 --> 46:46.640]  that was some dust for maybe a hundred miles away or maybe 5,000 miles away or
[46:46.640 --> 46:53.000]  maybe 10,000 miles away it would have to be tested to ascertain that but there's
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.560]  all sorts of university aircraft and studies that are done routinely where
[46:57.560 --> 47:02.280]  they'll send jet aircraft up to 30,000 feet 50,000 feet or higher and the jets
[47:02.280 --> 47:09.080]  will fly and basically have a scoop on the front that picks things up to test
[47:09.080 --> 47:13.080]  for air quality and they'll pick up stuff from volcanoes that were known to
[47:13.080 --> 47:19.240]  erupt from samples they got a hundred years ago they'll pick up bugs spiders
[47:19.240 --> 47:25.240]  pieces of moths because if there's a tornado or a storm sometimes bugs and
[47:25.240 --> 47:31.600]  and cat hair you name it bird feathers pieces of plastic it gets blown up into
[47:31.600 --> 47:36.720]  the upper atmosphere and basically rides the winds that can jet streams can be
[47:36.720 --> 47:41.200]  going 200 miles an hour or more so they just ride those winds sometimes for
[47:41.200 --> 47:45.160]  centuries and so there's all sorts of stuff in the atmosphere does that answer
[47:45.160 --> 47:49.360]  your question yes sir I just had a quick theory real quick if I could share
[47:49.360 --> 47:53.840]  with you you know the I got that video you had of what the world are they
[47:53.840 --> 47:59.840]  spraying that's kind of what was making me wonder but I say they're putting
[47:59.840 --> 48:04.920]  that aluminum in the atmosphere with those planes I really think that it has
[48:04.920 --> 48:08.960]  something to do with that harp system where it makes an electromagnetic field
[48:08.960 --> 48:15.080]  in the atmosphere where they can you know laser point that those beans from the
[48:15.080 --> 48:21.960]  harp system what do you think about that well we know that harp is a whole
[48:21.960 --> 48:26.320]  bunch of different programs weather modification over the horizon radar I
[48:26.320 --> 48:30.520]  mean the similar heart system is now being put in in different Middle Eastern
[48:30.520 --> 48:34.760]  countries and they just openly admit that they're using the ionization of the
[48:34.760 --> 48:39.560]  atmosphere with these big antenna arrays to manipulate the weather so yes
[48:39.560 --> 48:45.280]  there look that's the problem what we know about is 30 years old or more
[48:45.280 --> 48:49.120]  imagine what they've already got I appreciate your call Jason great points
[48:49.120 --> 48:55.600]  Wayne in Florida you're on the air Alex I wanted to thank you from the bottom of
[48:55.600 --> 49:02.880]  my heart we need a thousand of you the truth is so rare in America anymore
[49:02.880 --> 49:07.640]  well I'm only trying to survive here and in tyranny's on a good place for myself
[49:07.640 --> 49:12.400]  for my family so we're all in this together but but I mean thank you sir
[49:12.400 --> 49:16.800]  what do you think about the Ron Paul situation the Fox News hoax that's a
[49:16.800 --> 49:22.880]  that's a no no anyhow I have two comments that I wanted to make one is I
[49:22.880 --> 49:30.560]  don't quite understand why people do not go after the main family that runs all
[49:30.560 --> 49:34.280]  of this stuff in the first place let me tell you a little story that happened
[49:34.280 --> 49:38.720]  to me a couple of years ago off the coast of Florida here is me and a buddy
[49:38.720 --> 49:47.000]  were scuba diving and we were surrounded by about 16 or 17 big peracuda and
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.520]  they kept swimming around us and swimming around us and coming closer and
[49:52.520 --> 50:00.080]  you know finally buried shot the biggest one and they ran off about 20 or 25
[50:00.080 --> 50:07.400]  yards I guess and and started circling around chose another one that seemed to
[50:07.400 --> 50:14.640]  be about the you know about the biggest size and and they started circling us
[50:14.640 --> 50:18.360]  again anyhow we don't want to stay there I want to hear the rest of your story
[50:18.360 --> 50:23.040]  gotta go to break but obviously you were out speargun fishing Nanny and you
[50:23.040 --> 50:26.280]  probably had already shot a fish so they were smelling the blood or what
[50:26.280 --> 50:32.240]  happened well the bottom line is that we shot the biggest one the very first
[50:32.240 --> 50:38.280]  time and then they went back in a group and chose another leader and came up to
[50:38.280 --> 50:42.400]  us and this is what I don't quite understand is why in the world don't we
[50:42.400 --> 50:46.920]  go after the box the Rothschilds because according to history they're the ones
[50:46.920 --> 50:50.400]  that started all the stuff in the first place well they're a big part of it you
[50:50.400 --> 50:54.680]  know what let's let's talk about that when we come back on the other side with
[50:54.680 --> 50:59.720]  Wayne we'll go to Aaron Zach Patrick Jason and others
[51:01.960 --> 51:07.760]  this is not a drill repeat this is not a drill gun cells are on a staggering

[52:15.120 --> 52:20.120]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[52:20.120 --> 52:25.480]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[52:25.480 --> 52:30.400]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[54:14.640 --> 54:18.520]  activism with Luke Radowski coming up then of course Gerald Salente getting
[54:18.520 --> 54:22.520]  into the economy and the Egypt situation a lot more is gonna be popping in but
[54:22.520 --> 54:26.960]  great job with the Google bombs sometimes I don't do them for a week or two
[54:26.960 --> 54:31.680]  sometimes I do one every day for a whole week we put out Dick Cheney's
[54:31.680 --> 54:35.200]  stand-down dealing with a stand-down order and how he's been confronted over
[54:35.200 --> 54:38.960]  that it became the number one search term throughout the day and the evening
[54:38.960 --> 54:44.880]  and I couldn't sleep last night about 2 30 in the morning and I woke up and went
[54:44.880 --> 54:50.320]  in it was still in the top 10 on both hot topics and hot searches and I saw a
[54:50.320 --> 54:55.600]  whole bunch of big online publications picking up our story the we are changed
[54:55.600 --> 55:00.440]  video and it really had a big effect it ain't gonna save the world but all of it
[55:00.440 --> 55:06.840]  together with God's help is and so I want to do a top search term today Fox
[55:06.840 --> 55:11.600]  News caught if you put Fox News caught into a Google search engine and click
[55:11.600 --> 55:16.920]  web it's already the top links and so what this will do is people will wonder
[55:16.920 --> 55:22.080]  what Fox News has been caught in you see they've got to destroy Ron Paul they
[55:22.080 --> 55:26.520]  don't like to just do these risky out in the open lies unless they're really
[55:26.520 --> 55:30.960]  desperate and they can't have him winning the presidency it's already gonna be
[55:30.960 --> 55:35.560]  bad enough to have him in the debates if he runs which I guarantee he's going to
[55:35.560 --> 55:39.560]  unless he has any health issues and we got to really pray for him because just
[55:39.560 --> 55:43.560]  like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts said he said if Ron Paul continues to build like
[55:43.560 --> 55:47.160]  this they may go after him and Ron Paul said on this show he knows that's a real
[55:47.160 --> 55:53.080]  issue so he's putting a lot on the line for us we need to support him and Rand
[55:53.080 --> 55:56.800]  Paul's now going after the Patriot Act like he promised to do these are great
[55:56.800 --> 56:02.960]  men a great father and son duo and God love them but let's make Fox News caught
[56:02.960 --> 56:08.240]  the number one search term it's victory goes to whoever wants it the most so hit
[56:08.240 --> 56:15.160]  them hit them hard put those three words in Fox News caught CAU GHD Fox News
[56:15.160 --> 56:18.520]  caught and let's get into that article about them being caught running this
[56:18.520 --> 56:21.760]  dirty tricks campaign they've been caught with their pants down and I don't
[56:21.760 --> 56:26.560]  have some vendetta against Fox or any of the mainstream medium I'm just here
[56:26.560 --> 56:30.120]  exposing their dirty tricks and it's got to be done I wish that they do the
[56:30.120 --> 56:34.040]  right thing but they're not so Fox News caught get that into Google today now I
[56:34.040 --> 56:40.080]  think you answered your own question going back to the caller Wayne in
[56:40.080 --> 56:45.200]  Florida Wayne I think you answered your own question your buddy speargunned the big
[56:45.200 --> 56:49.560]  barracuda and when barracudas come up around me I just start chasing them
[56:49.560 --> 56:55.520]  because it's like if a dog runs up and tries to bite you and you run it's gonna
[56:55.520 --> 56:59.760]  go into its instincts and gun to attack you but if you stand your ground to the
[56:59.760 --> 57:04.640]  big dog unless it's a police trained attack dog 99% of the time they're gonna
[57:04.640 --> 57:09.840]  turn away and and I mean I was just in the Caribbean a few months ago and had
[57:09.840 --> 57:13.440]  a four foot and about a three foot and a couple other barracudas come up they
[57:13.440 --> 57:16.320]  were looking at me I just started chasing them didn't even have a speargun
[57:16.320 --> 57:20.000]  and boy they high-tailed it they high-tailed it now that's not the case
[57:20.000 --> 57:25.840]  with a great white shark but but with smaller predators it is though generally
[57:25.840 --> 57:28.840]  I've talked talked to and read some divers they say if you if you do go
[57:28.840 --> 57:34.600]  towards a great white or a tiger shark then they don't think your food if you
[57:34.600 --> 57:39.600]  act like a predator but I'm not saying that's fail safe now I'm not for violence
[57:39.600 --> 57:44.800]  either I am for defending myself and I am for politically exposing the Roth
[57:44.800 --> 57:48.960]  Childs who are right at the top of the pyramid but there were models of global
[57:48.960 --> 57:55.440]  government models of Empire before the Roth Childs really got control in 1815
[57:55.440 --> 58:00.160]  after they beat Napoleon they ran that stock market crash system and then
[58:00.160 --> 58:03.880]  basically bought the stock market of a pennies on the on the pound and I
[58:03.880 --> 58:10.160]  covered that my film in-game blueprint for global for global enslavement and so you
[58:10.160 --> 58:15.160]  know that's an important facet of everybody to look at but you know when
[58:15.160 --> 58:18.160]  I spent that five minutes another issue stay there I'm gonna finish up with you
[58:18.160 --> 58:21.960]  Wayne and I promise I'm gonna try to hurry through Aaron Zach Patrick Jason and

[58:28.160 --> 58:32.320]  know the Roth Childs all fell off a cliff tomorrow other barracudas would
[58:32.320 --> 58:37.640]  just replace them other sharp teeth but roll forward it's ideas and taking our

[59:00.600 --> 59:03.960]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest
[59:03.960 --> 59:07.560]  of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news

[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:19.680]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.240]  Alex Jones
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:31.160]  coming up in about 30 minutes I'm gonna premiere a little five minute eight
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:36.120]  second video that Aaron Dykes and I put together Aaron did a great job putting
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:41.280]  it together it tells basically the whole story in five minutes the takedown of
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:45.360]  Hosni Mubarak coming up in about 30 minutes that Gerald Salente is joining
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.880]  us also popping in is Luke Radowski I want to continue with your calls and
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:55.680]  attempt not that I ever succeed to hurry through them but Wayne in Florida if you
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.840]  just join us was telling a spear gunning story about I guess snorkeling or
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.240]  scuba diving off the coast of Florida with a dozen or so big barracudas
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.080]  swarming around them probably smelled blood from fish they were spearing and
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:12.200]  how they then shot one of the big ones and then the other ones went and regrouped
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:17.800]  and came back at him he's saying why don't we cut the head off the snake why
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:21.640]  don't we go after the the ruling families of the globalist that's a very
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:26.760]  dangerous game and they've put a corrupt system in and our own personal
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.560]  corruption has allowed it to happen and so we need to take our counties our
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:36.080]  cities our states back take our federal government back go after the big central
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:39.440]  banks through the legal system once we have control of it and restore the
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:44.120]  republic that way it's a very dangerous to just start talking about French
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:48.360]  Revolution style stuff because that almost always turns into a blood bath
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:53.200]  for everybody does not answer your question Wayne that's that's got most
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.960]  of it I have just one more comment that'll take about two and a half minutes
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:02.480]  that that I need to tell you because what we really do not have in this world
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:10.160]  is enough love it's like David Ike always said you know if it's not right
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.280]  don't do it if it's not the truth don't say it and only give love and never ever
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:19.120]  give negativity a second thought but what I had to say will only take a
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:25.840]  couple of minutes here depress my mind and depress my soul for I've got matters
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.760]  I'll always control feeling you this way and knowing it's not for me let me be me
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:36.040]  so open your eyes and you can see just like the emotions you get when you take
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:40.320]  part in someone's heart sopping up the hurt and pain just like you've been
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:44.640]  torn apart touching the agony and tasting emotions and knowing what was
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:50.320]  lost but telling yourself what you must do regardless of all costs so think of
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.800]  the times you felt the exact way who wondered how you really made it from
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.600]  day to day today hoping it would work and keeping your mind looking forward and
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.440]  straight and telling yourself it's gonna work out because that's all within my
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:10.720]  fate for positive thoughts we'd beauty and laughter in the lives that exist so
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.880]  keep yourself in the realm of motion and do nothing but persist you can do it you
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:21.320]  can do it and the first thing you know you can winning them all and helping
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:27.280]  no one to fall and that'll be our plan so talk to yourself once in a while and

[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:38.760]  really smothers for it's not much to ask for people relating to persons in great

[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:48.840]  name it to bring order out of chaos are trying to overthrow a swath of countries
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:55.200]  not just Tunisia or Egypt but Saudi Arabia Jordan Yemen and obviously this
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.440]  is going to drive up oil prices this is going to drive up food prices is going
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:02.920]  to drive up commodities and only exacerbate those countries where the
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:07.960]  people are only making a few bucks a day on average like Egypt and now the
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:12.280]  media admits that they sent people into overthrow Mubarak and then right as he
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:17.440]  defiantly says no I won't step down when Panetta the head of the CIA had said he
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:22.280]  was going to step down hours before he magically has a stroke and disappears and
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:25.960]  no one knows where he is is he in a resort in Egypt is he a resort in Israel
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:30.160]  did he go to Germany nobody knows all these conflicting reports is he dead
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:36.880]  now we hear he's near death did he have a stroke on and on and on and on such
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:43.800]  convenient timing and now this happens Bloomberg oil climbs as Israel says
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:48.240]  Iranian warships heading for Syria it might be true but we have a media that
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:53.680]  told us that Russia attacked Georgia on 888 in 2008 we have a media that says
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.360]  that people booed Ron Paul they play fake video on Fox News saying he was booed
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:02.960]  at CPAC when he won I mean who knows if this is even true but we'll find out in
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:06.800]  the next few hours in fact let's start checking foreign press let's just let's
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:14.520]  check press TV the official Iranian government was Iranian government
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:19.400]  funded but let's press let's check press TV and see if the Iranians are saying
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:25.560]  that they are indeed putting ships into that area which are crawling with
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:33.880]  Israeli NATO and US ships oil climbs as Israel says Iranian warships heading
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:39.920]  for Syria crude rose after Israeli foreign minister Lieberman said two
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.400]  Iranian gunboats are planning to move through the Suez Canal to Syria spurring
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:49.200]  concern that Middle Eastern oil shipments will be disrupted and you're
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.520]  talking about 30 plus percent of the oil in the world 10 percent of all commerce
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.800]  going through that you got the Marines deploying you've got the Israeli
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:02.000]  singer on a war footing this is crazy over two gunboats a gunboat member Dick
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.360]  Cheney wanted to have fake gunboats painted up like Iranian boats attack
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:12.040]  our own ships that's now been confirmed New York magazine and the New Yorkers
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:17.400]  reported on that so who knows if this is even true oil climbed as much as 1.9
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:22.800]  percent after Lieberman called the move he expects later today a provocation well
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:26.560]  is it a provocation when u.s. and Israeli ships and submarines are right off the
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.680]  coast of Iran I mean come on what's good for the goose is good for the gander
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:35.240]  oil climbed as much as 1.9 percent after Lieberman called the move he expects
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:39.960]  later today oh it hadn't happened yet a provocation the Associated Press reported
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:44.520]  the first ever protest against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi as demonstrations
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:49.360]  took place in Bahrain and Yemen this is the latest addition to the Middle East
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:56.400]  risk premium said Phil Flynn vice president of research at P FG Besson
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.520]  Chicago this is a knee-jerk reaction to the headlines that Iran is planning to
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:04.520]  send two warships through the Suez Canal crude oil for March delivery rose
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:12.400]  81 cents or 1% to 85 point 13 a barrel and was as much as 103 just a few weeks

[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.000]  after Egyptian president housing Mubarak step down you mean disappeared Israeli
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.040]  leaders have voiced concern that Iran may exploit the period of transition the
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.600]  tension of the Middle East is having a greater impact on the Brent market and
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:56.880]  it goes on from there here's another one precious metals comics gold hire on
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:02.800]  Iran warship news gold edged hire on reports that Iran plans to send warships
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:06.600]  through the Suez Canal Israel has described Iran's plans to send two
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:12.200]  warships of the key shipping thoroughfare as a provocation gold spiked up
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:17.880]  more than six dollars and 30 cents to 1,380 dollars and 40 cents per Troy
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:23.400]  ounce and it's still moving up as we read you this news report okay let's go
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.520]  back to your phone calls will continue to watch this as it develops Aaron in
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:32.600]  Nevada you're on the air are you doing Alex thank you very much for your work
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:40.100]  exposing fluoride I haven't internet radio shows called go knob and we have a
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:42.960]  lot of great guests that are in the modern truth movement because there's a
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:47.840]  lot of people got their start on YouTube etc. they're going forward and getting
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:52.120]  their own shows and so you're a big influence a lot of people however I
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:59.040]  must quarrel with your minimizing of the impact of the Rothschilds on this whole
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:10.040]  affair they created Israel and go ahead so there could be no more efficient use
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:17.920]  of the motives of the truth movement to remove it Allah Ron Paul he's going
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:22.160]  after their number one business model which is the Federal Reserve so I
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:25.600]  think we should stay with the focus on the Rothschilds always here I have an
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:30.240]  argument with you and I have one question for you do you have any open
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:35.040]  active Zionists working for you serious question no or do you not no I
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:42.040]  appreciate your call look it's not fair to call up when we don't screen your
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:49.440]  calls and say that I'm not covering the Rothschilds I mean I've made multiple
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.920]  films that cover the fact that the Rothschilds have been one of the main
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.520]  drivers and I said just 20 minutes ago and that they're up at the very top of
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:05.680]  the pyramid I mean that's what I said on air so my whole issue is there's like
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:10.880]  a movement there's a bunch of different movements to say it's the nations that
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:14.520]  run it all or it's the Zionists that run it all or it's the Catholics that run
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:20.080]  it all or a few other groups and then people just getting these camps and
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.960]  fight with each other all day about who is the purist who is the best who has
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:29.280]  all the answers and it's easy for people who've never really done a lot in the
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:35.480]  fight for liberty to kind of take a scalp or count coup and say well I've
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:44.440]  exposed Alex Jones and so I am this great leader when I just don't have
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:50.160]  respect for a lot of the people that criticize the corruption that goes on
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:54.880]  in Israel and Israel's involvement the move for global government because a
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:16:00.160]  lot of them aren't intellectually honest I mean that's intellectually dishonest
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:05.160]  when I say the Rothschilds are right up at the very top of the pyramid but then
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:08.920]  I add that there's always been moves for Empire and that these models were
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.840]  already existing there and so it's something that these elites are
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:21.520]  continually pushing for I mean it's it's crazy but hey more power to you I mean
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:26.480]  I constantly get emails saying respond to the fact that you fired this radio
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:30.240]  host and then I'd look it up and the radio host on Genesis quit and says
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:35.080]  they quit it's just schizophrenic I mean it's it's it's delusional or respond to
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:39.600]  the fact that you work for ABC news Genesis has leased over the years I
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:44.560]  think five different satellites and you can call if you have a gardening show or
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.600]  a race car show or a show about football or a show about politics you have to
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.960]  call if you start a network and you have to shop around and find out what
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:56.320]  receiver stations have and what they want and then that's how you're on that
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:03.000]  kind of like I have an iPhone and it has AT&T service on it but I don't work for
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.720]  AT&T I don't work for Apple and in fact I criticize AT&T and Apple but it's
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:15.880]  something I use to be effective in the world to kind of enter the matrix so I
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:23.960]  mean there's nothing to respond to I mean it's crazy I'm not an anti-semite
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:29.120]  though and I think that's what people really have a problem with and the white
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.920]  supremacists are pretty much fed run it comes out constantly that their main
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:37.400]  leaders are feds like Hal Turner and many others and it comes out in the news
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.200]  constantly the people leading clan rallies or leading Nazi rallies the feds
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:47.160]  haven't infiltrated them they set them up to again create Balkanization and a
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:50.960]  call to restrict the First Amendment so here I am on air taking your phone
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:58.800]  calls and it becomes a debate about Alex Jones I mean here I am saying I don't
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:02.960]  want war in the Middle East here I am saying I want an end of the Patriot Act
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:10.360]  here I am supporting Ron Paul trying to get rid of the Federal Reserve and good
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:16.560]  fruits good things but there's a lot of things that enter into this mainly it's
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:23.160]  jealousy and I'm not even saying that with the caller but but with some people
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:28.160]  it's jealousy it's jealousy that I make powerful films it's jealousy that I work
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:33.400]  so hard it's jealousy that I've built a strong organization to get the word out
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:40.840]  and but more than just jealousy people can't believe that someone could be
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:45.360]  effective people can't believe that Ron Paul's real look at his voting record
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:53.240]  it's stellar it's perfect people can't believe that I call Homeland Security
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:56.840]  live on air that's not even that big of a deal I don't even see that as the
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:00.480]  courage and they say no those are all fake calls when he calls Homeland
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:05.400]  Security I mean I dial the number on air I call them it's real I interview big
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:08.960]  guests people say that wasn't Willie Nelson you know that wasn't Jesse
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:14.600]  Ventura that wasn't George Norrie and it's like respond to the fake interview
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:18.200]  with George Norrie there's nothing to respond to I can't respond you know
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:25.120]  respond and admit that you are Bill Hicks I'm not Bill Hicks I mean just
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:32.240]  because somebody says something on the internet does not make it true it is the
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:37.600]  height the bizarreness but believe in yourself I mean I try to be a platform
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.320]  other radio shows wouldn't let somebody call in and plug themselves and I knew
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:44.080]  when the guy was doing what was coming next I could just tell by the by the
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:48.040]  satisfaction by the slowness of the voice I've heard a million times it's
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:55.560]  like you got a lot of people out there who either they can't believe that people
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:58.540]  are real or they don't have respect for themselves or they're jealous and hey
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:03.280]  more power to you is it really possible to get out of debt without payment

[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:35.360]  to divide us along different lines and have us just fight with each other all
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:40.040]  day like crabs in a bucket instead of focusing on the global banking cartel
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.560]  and removing the fractional reserve banking system you can put whatever you
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:49.920]  want at the head of it and have a voodoo doll other Rothschilds or the Vatican
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:53.480]  or the Easter Bunny and you can sit there and stab it and you know in your
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:57.720]  bedroom all night that's great and beat your chest and say I'm better than Alex
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:03.400]  Jones you know I talk about Jews all day good for you good more power to you
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:08.320]  I'm here to say I got my bill of rights in my Constitution I want constitutional
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:12.760]  money and I want my country back and if we just follow the Constitution all of
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:16.240]  these corrupt interests won't be able to run our nation okay so that's simple
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:20.720]  let's go ahead and talk to Zach in Illinois Zach you're on the air welcome
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:25.560]  hey I'm actually from Texas but first off I want to thank you let me be clear
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.400]  because I keep getting calls with different states behind them you're in
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.640]  Texas you're not in Illinois yeah I'm in Texas okay we're gonna go back through
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:38.320]  the calls and we're gonna check those states there okay Zach go ahead okay so
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:43.240]  I wanted to clarify something that you have been saying okay so there was a
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:48.160]  congressional committee and there were the the the head of the CIA the head of
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:53.200]  the FBI whatnot they were being asked about terror threats and a congressman
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:57.120]  asked Panetta on what Mubarak would do that day and this was on Thursday the day
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.760]  that Mubarak announced that he would be giving his powers to the vice president
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:06.280]  so the Panetta the director of the CIA goes well we had gotten some documents
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:11.720]  on what he might do we don't have anything on what he will do but from my
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:15.720]  perspective from what I know I would say that he would give his powers to the
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:19.960]  vice president so on and so forth so then I get on the news all the main media
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:24.800]  what he basically said is Mubarak what Mubarak had said was that he's gonna
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:29.760]  transfer his powers to the VP so the CIA director knew beforehand exactly what
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:34.060]  Mubarak was gonna do I'm sure that's not a surprise to you but also I had a
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:41.160]  suggestion for all these people who come on here bashing you Alex I mean I'm a
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:44.160]  huge listener I think you're doing good I don't I don't know how you can possibly
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:48.360]  be correct when you talk about Ron I don't I don't care I don't look let's
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:52.520]  just say I'm evil I'm not but let's just say I'm corrupt and as wicked as
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:59.120]  BLZ about himself it okay let's move on from Alex Jones let's get take back our
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:03.800]  states take back our counties people are waking up let's not always turn it
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:09.120]  around and turn it into something about Alex Jones that that's what losers do
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:14.840]  all they do is in fight with each other and run around and engage in a bunch of
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:18.680]  mindless garbage I'm here to do a radio show can you imagine people driving
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:23.040]  around the country listening to us on AM and FM stations right now and they're
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:28.200]  wondering what we're even talking about I appreciate your call I mean I'm here
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:31.720]  to take your phone calls and talk about issues let's go ahead and talk to
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:38.040]  Patrick in Ohio Patrick you're on the air hello Alex I want to say one thing
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:43.080]  about Ron Paul in a straw poll is how do you get 30% such a big lead and get
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:47.840]  booed it just doesn't make sense to me no he didn't get booed it was fake they
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:52.840]  admit it was fake it's unbelievable that Fox for those that just joined us let
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:55.640]  me just recap it since you brought it up thank God a listener actually brought
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:03.200]  up a real issue Ron Paul last year won the straw poll and Mitt Romney's people
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:07.360]  were all together in one area Fox News this came out the time had a microphone
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:11.920]  amongst them to make the booing overpower the thousands of people that
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:17.080]  were cheering this year it didn't work that way overwhelming standing ovation
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:20.400]  throughout the entire you mean you hear it it's all over the crowd it's not
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:27.280]  coming from one side Ron Paul won and then these cheaters on Fox News get him
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:31.280]  on and say here's a clip of you being booed this year just a few days ago and
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.560]  it wasn't it was from the year before and we've got the total proof of it in the
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:40.880]  video posted in Paul Joseph Watson's article Fox News caught in shocking
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:45.280]  dirty tricks stunt against Ron Paul and we're doing the keyword search term Fox
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:49.600]  News caught now go ahead you got the floor I think it's great that they did
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.760]  that we get a chance to expose them for the new kinds that they really are and
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.760]  we get to get it out there word out wake some more people up that's where it's
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:00.560]  all about and I want to thank you again Alex and wait for your listen to your
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.880]  comment well let me ask you this Patrick a Patrick let me ask you this why do you

[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:15.480]  they could get away with this because they got away with it for so long I mean
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:20.800]  they've done it over and over again for what 30 years 60 years and people are
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:23.480]  starting to wake up and see their see through their rhetoric and they they
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:29.200]  can't they can't figure it out yet eventually they will but yeah or they're
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.440]  just arrogant they never will great points Patrick good good having you on

[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:04.080]  hour but right now Jason in Connecticut you're on the air Alex it's I'm so
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:09.280]  grateful to talk to you and your audience I woke up a year ago and I'm

[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.440]  CEO came out and said he's very very proud of that exec who organized the
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:25.520]  protests in Egypt little quintessential that you know CIA back Google would you
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:32.640]  know Google is CIA it's admittedly set up by Incutel their public venture firm
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:38.560]  it is NSA spying software that they use so basically you're searching the web
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:43.240]  using NSA keyword technology that's the backbone of Google system they helped
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:47.760]  run the revolution it's all the big New Brzezinski David Rockefeller type
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:52.640]  operation and it's there in plain view go ahead amen you know first of all I
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:57.440]  say we're Americans okay you know don't let your eyes refuse to see don't let
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:01.880]  your ears refuse to hear and don't let your voice refuse to be heard I think
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:06.400]  Americans need to step up we need to just wake our neighbors up wake up our

[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:38.440]  mentioned that Bush was inspiring citizens to become a point of light you
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:41.640]  know that sounds like an Illuminati type of phrase is to me you know he said a
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:47.320]  thousand points of light which is an Illuminati term you're absolutely right
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:52.000]  anything else I just want to say America wake up again don't let your eyes
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.200]  refuse to see don't let your ears refuse to hear and don't let your voices be
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:00.920]  refused to be heard we all need to stand up together work as Americans we are

[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:14.320]  an American let's just bring it back guys absolutely look at the awakening
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:18.920]  that's happening look at how far we've come together and talking about this V
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:26.560]  for victory campaign the answer to 1974 1776 campaign it is so huge what is
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:29.880]  happening with that it is just unbelievable this is the biggest
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:33.680]  response we've ever had and I see all these incredible videos of people out
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:38.720]  there involved in activism I salute all of you it is so incredible to behold
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:44.040]  Carissa in New Mexico you're on the year but I've been listening for about two
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:48.360]  months and you really have a powerful insight into how the world works I wanted
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:51.480]  to tell you about something you probably already know but it's a powerful way to
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:56.640]  describe it which is a concept for physics called Maxwell's demon and and
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:01.560]  it's a way to describe the second law of thermodynamics that Maxwell came up
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:07.920]  with and it basically is a hypothetical system that explains that for heat to
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:13.560]  flow from cold to hot you would have to have a hypothetical demon controlling
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:17.200]  interrogating each molecule that goes one way and the other and I think this is
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:22.800]  how the globalists can forge into new areas they're not in yet where there
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:27.640]  may be places like court decisions or committees reviewing proposals and so
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:31.720]  forth where subjectivity comes into play and then it's only in those
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:37.200]  subjective points where you know that they can make the judgment call and
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:41.560]  push things their way I think this is a powerful analogy and it creates a lot of
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:46.160]  structure and biological systems and I think you could apply it to you know how
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:50.160]  the globalists are able to infiltrate and make it look like things are
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:53.080]  proceeding by law and order but but they're really not and they're really
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:57.240]  only going well the globalist study how humans operate and how civilizations
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:01.400]  develop and they know how to deploy themselves at key junctures and by
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:05.800]  controlling the issuance of currency and credit they're able to take over the
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:11.840]  entire planet because they issue the symbol of energy the symbol of food the
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:17.960]  symbol of substance and and what sustains people and so through the
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:23.400]  issuance of fiat currency and credit they take over the world great points I
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:29.240]  appreciate your call let's talk to Scott in Washington Scott you're on the
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:35.520]  year yeah Alex I wanted to talk a little bit about this thing that they're
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:39.840]  trying to run with this healthcare hoax as in the light of the last decision but
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:44.200]  I wanted to ask you something real quick before I get into that you had mentioned
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:48.240]  back in December something about you had wanted to get Mike Revelle on your show
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:53.480]  in light of a new 9-11 investigation and I don't know whether or not you were
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:59.440]  able to do that but I had sent to both your show tips and your Aaron at
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:03.200]  Imple Wars his contact information and I don't know whether or not you ever got
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:08.720]  it or not. I'm having one of those forgetful moments the name rings a bell
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:14.560]  isn't he the liberal talk show host no he was he was the senator from Alaska
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:18.560]  ran for oh okay I thought you were saying Revelle you're talking about former
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:24.160]  senator Gravelle yes absolutely I know who he is that's why I couldn't pull up
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:29.760]  who it was because I was hearing you wrong yes I want to get senator Gravelle
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:34.440]  on because he's very boldly come out and talked about 9-11 being an inside job
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:38.720]  and it's a very very exciting because yeah he does want to come on because he did
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:44.280]  send me his new contact information to forward to you and I had sent it to show
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:48.240]  tips on December 29th I don't know if you got it yeah some of that stuff gets
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:53.160]  lost in the mix why don't you why don't you you know I'm gonna put you on hold
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:56.480]  but just please don't send us a bunch of spam that because it gets filled up I'm
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:00.480]  gonna give you my producer's email and you can send us that new info I really
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:04.760]  appreciate it anything else Scott yeah I just wanted to bring up real quickly
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:08.360]  about this health care the new hoax that they're trying to run around and
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:12.560]  especially and I've heard Tom Hartman doing this trying to say that there's
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:16.880]  nowhere in the Constitution where a federal judge or the Supreme Court has
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:22.200]  a right to overturn a law that's made if it's constitutional and then trying to
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:27.360]  quote article 3 section to the Constitution which is absolutely bull
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:31.000]  because they think that nobody is actually gonna go and check it out for
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.440]  themselves and then when you actually read it it doesn't say what they're
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:38.480]  trying to allege that they're saying that's just another hoax that they're
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:42.560]  now trying to run well notice so-called liberals love courts overturning laws
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:46.560]  when it's laws that they don't like but now they're saying courts because they're
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:49.960]  overturning it across the board don't have a right to overturn health care of
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:54.720]  course it's unconstitutional to make you buy something from a private interest
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:59.960]  if they can make you buy insurance they can make you buy a Maytag dishwasher or
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:04.440]  they can make you buy you know diamonds from the local diamond shop they can
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:07.880]  make you eat broccoli I mean it's it's it's it's it's indentured
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:11.800]  servitude it's it's a form of enslavement where they don't put you on a
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:17.280]  plantation they just make you buy things from them and you're absolutely right
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:22.840]  that courts are there to overturn laws that are unconstitutional I appreciate
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:28.520]  your points on that I'm gonna go ahead now and get into this housing
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:33.840]  mubarak situation then I'll come back and go to Brian Charles David Matt and
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:43.760]  others if you go to info wars.com you can see the second story in the featured
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:51.480]  news area it's titled the takedown of Hosni Mubarak why has the media left
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:56.400]  untouched the mystery of Mubarak's reported coma coinciding with his sudden
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:02.720]  departure he refuses to step down and then magically disappears and we hear he
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:07.520]  has stepped down that's a classic coup and I'm no fan of Hosni Mubarak but what
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:11.320]  does this say to other dictators the globalist control what does this say I
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.760]  mean it shows how ruthless and backstabbing these people are and now
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:19.560]  they're putting in the same military junta that was in control before and
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:22.640]  they're trying to overthrow other countries in the Middle East to
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:26.560]  destabilize things and look look at Iran now with the reported warships this is
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:30.800]  escalating this is a strategy of tension of divide and conquer of
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:35.520]  balkanization via the great game let's go ahead and go to this five minute
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:54.280]  video that breaks it down the takedown of Hosni Mubarak how dumb does the system
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:46:04.680]  think we are 30 years or three decades of his iron rule over the North African
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:08.880]  all right that's enough we have a computer system problem that continues
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:13.240]  to do that I'm gonna have to purchase whatever computers are maybe we should
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:16.920]  put apples in there instead of PCs running Linux or whatever to play these
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:20.400]  videos because this is this is happening to more and more of the videos and
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:26.120]  basically just devastating the broadcast that more and more it does this
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:31.760]  where remember last week it was playing I was playing clips of Obama and it was
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:38.480]  sounding like he was drunk okay we'll go ahead and play the video now here it
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:52.200]  is how dumb does the system think we are 30 years or three decades of his iron
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:59.560]  rule over the North African state of Egypt Hosni Mubarak refuses to step down
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:03.040]  even though the head of the CIA is in front of Congress saying he's gonna
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:07.920]  step down in a few hours Mubarak comes out and defiantly says I will not step
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:13.640]  down I will not let this foreign conspiracy overtake Egypt and then
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:19.160]  magically we're now told he had a stroke right after that and the army
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:23.880]  announced the next day that they would be quote reforming things this is a
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:29.480]  public military coup there's no democratization there's no calls for
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:34.680]  election CNN and Anderson Cooper who's admitted CIA are announcing how great
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:40.920]  this move towards freedom is Mubarak is reportedly in Egypt with a stroke or
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:48.480]  maybe even dad he's in northern Israel on the side of the sea we don't know
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:53.880]  where he is and where's the media this is an issue that isn't even being
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:48:00.640]  discussed right after he says I will not step down this happens to him what's
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:04.680]  developing here is the bodies are being buried this guy has been the
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:08.840]  distribution center for the kidnapped people being taken to torture sites all
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:13.880]  over the world this is the main central site for black sites or ghost sites where
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:18.720]  all this illegal activity is going on this guy has the dirt on George W. Bush
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:25.400]  he has the dirt on Barack Obama this is the man who's followed all of their
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:31.520]  oars there's a problem in the last year it's been reported that Hosni Mubarak
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:38.320]  refused to politically get behind greenlighting an attack on Iran when
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:44.760]  Egypt is on Israel's Western flank Hosni Mubarak refused to expand other wars
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:49.520]  in the region and this is a message to all the other Arab regimes you get
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:54.680]  behind this buildup towards war with Iran or it's over for you politically and
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:58.360]  now the Muslim Brotherhood is admittedly British intelligence is trying to
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:04.440]  overthrow Saudi Arabia Yemen Jordan all of these allies what does this say to
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:07.120]  people that have gone along with the New World Order what does it say to
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:10.280]  individuals watching out there that have bought into teaming up with this
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:16.240]  system you will be betrayed in the end how much more obvious does it have to
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:20.680]  get and you look at the fate of Nasser with the heart attack after he gave a
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:25.640]  defiant speech and other leaders in Egypt and many other countries this is a
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:30.560]  message being sent to the world not just Middle Eastern politicians not just
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:36.360]  politicians in Africa or Latin America or Asia but to American politicians just
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:40.200]  like the message was sent with John F Kennedy's murder if you don't play ball
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:45.600]  and submit to the banking cartel we will kill you whether it's a gunshot to the
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:50.160]  head or whether it's a convenient stroke or heart attack but the current issue
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:54.640]  that's looking us right in the eyes that's in our face is why isn't the
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:59.040]  corporate media in the US talking more about the mysterious disappearance of
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:03.280]  Hosni Mubarak the biggest story in the world right now is Egypt and the
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:07.200]  rebellions spreading all over the Middle East North Africa why isn't it a
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:12.160]  bigger discussion about where Mubarak has gone to and what messages that send
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:17.520]  all these plant dictators and servants that the British and the Swiss and
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:22.040]  others are moving to seize the ill-gotten gains of Hosni Mubarak after he
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:26.680]  served them so well yes Mubarak was a terrible dictator just like Sunam Hussein
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:31.600]  just like bin Laden was a globalist asset but why are they treating their
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:37.360]  servants so badly did they ask him to do something so horrible that his
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:44.720]  conscience kicked in we know the facts there was a Western funded military coup
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:51.160]  of Egypt there are no elections just like shark teeth Mubarak has been removed
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:58.240]  and another row has rolled up and then we're told this is freedom the people
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:01.760]  are smart enough to understand what's happening and of the globalist want
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:06.160]  dictatorships in Egypt and in every other country they influence what do they
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:10.600]  want domestically and we know they want a police state tyranny and the very same
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:15.120]  corporate interest that run Egypt run the United States through fraud and

[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:07.560]  to friends family they say well what you're saying the revolution isn't good
[01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:13.080]  in Egypt and I'm like no the people have a right to revolt they don't deserve to
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:18.160]  be under a dictatorship but our supposed government chooses to put
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:23.520]  dictators in and to support dictators all over the world including Hosni
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:28.160]  Mubarak then suddenly they tell Mubarak to step down when he doesn't step down
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:34.400]  he has a stroke and disappears and it's not a bigger media issue and then
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:44.880]  there's the larger discussion in all of this that we have to look at and that is
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:52.640]  why on earth does our government try to put dictators in around the world and
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:56.880]  what does that mean about what they want to install here in the United States and
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:53:01.120]  then it goes even further how do they go from telling us Mubarak's a great guy
[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:05.760]  to overnight this is democracy this is freedom this is great what's happening
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:10.960]  I mean don't people put two and two together they're not even setting up a
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:18.760]  constitutional republic they're not even setting up mob rule democratization
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:24.600]  they're just putting in the military men that were below him and we know that
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:30.800]  Mubarak refused a year ago to get behind an attack on Iran that is to
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:34.600]  politically support it and allow aircraft to overfly and land inside the
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:39.000]  country and it's on the western flank of Israel we know that he did a lot of
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:44.120]  other things that made them mad and so basically a message is being sent you do
[01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:50.200]  what you're told or you're gonna have a stroke Mubarak was told to step down our
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:53.240]  media said he was gonna step down he was supposed to give a speech and step down
[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:57.880]  he defiantly got up and said I'm not stepping down until September I've got
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:02.040]  to have this transition of government or the country's gonna be engulfed in the
[01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:07.920]  chaos and he went further and said that more radical elements of Islam are gonna
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:12.240]  get control and then we're gonna end up having wars that's the plan Mubarak
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:18.080]  that's the program that the globalist want that's the strategy of tension
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:21.840]  Brzezinski's written books on it Kissinger's given speeches on it this is
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:26.280]  not a secret but the social controllers are counting on the general public not
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:30.520]  looking into this because it's too sophisticated on the surface let's go
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:33.560]  back to your phone calls ahead of Luke Radowski joining us Brian in
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:40.600]  Connecticut thanks for holding welcome hi Alex hey yeah thing is you just did
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:45.080]  that video about the media not covering what's going on with Mubarak quite
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:48.440]  obvious why they're not covering it doesn't suit their agenda they they
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:53.400]  want to try to keep us you know in the dark now you know throughout all of the
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:57.400]  videos and documentaries that you have brought to enlighten people which I give
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:02.720]  you enormous respect and admiration for the thing that I'm having a problem with
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:07.920]  is I've been unemployed for almost two years now my benefits are going to be
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:12.600]  running out my girlfriend works in retail her hours are being caught even
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:16.040]  during the busiest time of the year they're in a holiday she was working on
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:20.760]  part-time hours you know so our funds are running out I don't have the money to
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:26.320]  go make flyers to make stickers anytime I look to find activist groups where I
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:31.160]  can join with them and and go to my local government and protest what's going on
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:35.000]  it's it almost seems like I'm being hindered from making connections with
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.080]  these people I can't search through search engines to find them my question to
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:43.040]  you is because you are a leader to the people people are looking to you for
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:47.160]  direction is there any way that you can help in and in making connections from
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:51.640]  person A to person Z from the east coast to the west coast so that people can
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:56.080]  actually start to organize to make a movement because in my eye I feel as
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:59.400]  though with what's been going on with politics since Reagan since you know
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:03.480]  what even way before they're just puppets you know Obama came in screaming
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:07.200]  change I'm gonna change I'm gonna change he pulled the 180 what's to prevent
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:11.200]  Ron Paul from doing the same thing I'm very skeptical you know I don't know
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:15.800]  who to turn to I don't know who to trust and I'm scared I'm afraid I lose
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:19.440]  sleep that night I talked to all my neighbors I talked to my friends when I
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:23.200]  go into stores and I pay to cashier I try to get their mind thinking of you
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:28.440]  know what's going on maybe looking into it and it just like sure Brian Brian I
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:30.840]  understand your concern and I appreciate your call let me try to
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:37.800]  briefly answer that extremely deep and complex issue that you raise there let's
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:43.800]  just take one part of what you say because so much was said a I can't do
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:48.640]  everything I've tried for several years to build a social network that works
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:52.320]  right we built one it got 30 something thousand members and started crashing and
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:55.800]  having problems I built another one last year paid for it didn't work right
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:00.240]  I've got now people hired in-house trying to just build a basic one for
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:04.880]  people to get connected and together so I'm working as hard as I can that said I
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:10.400]  hear you we're trying I'm trying to step up to the plate here as best I can now
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:16.760]  on the other issue of Ron Paul look at Ron Paul's voting record it's perfect
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:22.840]  as a constitutionalist it's unbelievably good he's a constitutionalist and so you
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:27.480]  judge a tree by its fruits Obama was a guy who said that he believes in the
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:31.240]  total abolition of firearms he's a guy that gave speeches about how he wanted
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:36.280]  socialist health care he's a guy who was financed with four times the money of
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:39.800]  John McCain by Wall Street and said he was going to be an anti Wall Street
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:44.400]  corruption candidate so a lot of that is just basic research and discernment I
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:49.240]  mean we we didn't say Obama was gonna be good we said Obama was gonna be bad and
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:53.240]  do just what he's done and I made the seminal film Obama deception that's
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:57.320]  evergreen and gets more important with time watch it it's free online that
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:01.920]  matter if you're not employed it's free just Google the Obama deception watch it
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:06.240]  for free email it to friends and family that's basically free I can't do more
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:10.960]  than that but just to say I don't know who to trust I don't trust Ron Paul okay
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:14.960]  well whatever run for city council yourself you may not win but you'll be
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:23.920]  able to be at the debates and inject real ideas but you know to just say the
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:27.000]  globalists want you to give up they want you to see how much fraud they've
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:30.840]  engaged in and then not believe that you have any power or there could be
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:34.880]  somebody real Ron Paul is not the answer to all our problems he's just one
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:41.720]  component to the answer and that answer is resistance resistance is victory
[01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:53.400]  thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live com today hundreds of nations have
[01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:58.040]  fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not

[01:59:02.600 --> 01:59:06.880]  from underneath the Americans at home I've determined members influence on our
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:11.100]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:16.320]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:20.880]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:25.320]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:29.040]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:32.960]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:38.520]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:43.800]  USA Today now finally covering it it's real it's happening but Luke Radowski
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:48.960]  the founder of We Are Change hundreds of chapters around the world confronting
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:53.160]  every globalist you can imagine getting a Dick Cheney's face at CPAC last week
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:59.000]  that video is now gone viral at we are change.org and info wars.com listeners
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.920]  you did a great job you made Cheney stand-down order the number one search
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:09.000]  term yesterday a whole bunch of news picked up on it went wow you mean the
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:16.440]  head of the transportation department did say Cheney order to stand down and
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:21.960]  they see the congressional C-span clip I mean it's really gotten the word out Luke
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:25.760]  there's so much to discuss here but in this segment why don't you tell folks
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:30.800]  about the founding of We Are Change you may not know all about it and it's an
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:34.520]  idea it's not centrally controlled that's why it stopped infiltrators from
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:38.160]  being able to bring it down because it's an idea and ideas are bulletproof and
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:42.920]  just the hundreds of globalist on both sides of the fake political spectrum you
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:46.920]  guys have confronted yeah I mean we are change you brought a perfect fact is an
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:50.640]  idea we're not really an official organization there's really you know
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:54.240]  there's no kind of it there's nothing anything really special about it it's
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:57.600]  just about fighting for liberty and doing the right thing people get caught
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:01.160]  up with different organizations and who's doing this and who's doing that but
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:05.080]  really it doesn't matter it's only the good work that people do to help
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:08.240]  promote education to help other people that really matters at the end of the
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:12.160]  day and I just started going out there confronting being a presence key and
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:16.960]  ever since then it's just been an onslaught of you know David Rockefeller
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:21.200]  you know Giuliani Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton you know the other
[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:25.280]  Rockefellers and so many other individuals we were able to confront and
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:29.560]  the best thing about this is we were able to inspire so many other people to
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:33.200]  take action in their cities in their towns and through the same that's right
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:38.440]  we've seen Rothschilds confronted all over the world we've and we now see
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:41.960]  other groups forming and confronting people and that's good because it makes
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:45.760]  you know there's more targets of us out there harder to stop us we've seen
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:50.640]  Al Gore confronted I mean you name it John Stewart whose brother runs the
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:55.200]  New York Stock Exchange telling us how good the New World Order is he's being
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:59.320]  confronted his goons attacked you guys and got arrested I mean we're really
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:03.240]  showing who these people are exactly we just confronted David Horowitz and I'm
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:07.120]  gonna have more videos ready for everybody from you know my actions at
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:12.000]  CPAC we got Newt Kinmert we got James Woolsey the former CIA director you know
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.120]  we got Michelle Bachman we're gonna have so many more videos ready for
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:18.560]  everybody and I'm just gonna make this you know pretty much my full-time job I
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:21.960]  want to go out there I want to go to the trial lateral commission meetings the
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:25.980]  G20 meetings the Bilderberg meetings I want to go out there and you know be
[02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:29.760]  there wherever these people are and get in their face with the truth and just
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:33.800]  let them know because it is such a powerful act to let them know that we
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:38.200]  are not you know we are not sheep but we are not stupid we are intelligent
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:41.960]  caring people will give a damn and we'll make a difference in this world and we
[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:45.440]  will tell you no we're not gonna have your one-world government you're not
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:49.000]  gonna try to you know destroy this economy and now we see folks even when
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:54.600]  David Rockefeller is in Chile being confronted eloquently we see Zbigniew
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:58.400]  Brzezinski and and this is the key I want to talk about when we come back but
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:03.000]  the globalist create a climate that is gonna cause rebellion but then they're
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.800]  gonna try to steer the revolution towards solutions that bring more
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:11.320]  corruption more power more world government that's why what we are
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:15.880]  change is doing and I'm just so honored folks because Luke's openly again it's
[02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:19.520]  an example of what he's now inspired and what that others inspire you know Luke
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:23.800]  watching me get arrested by Bush or confronting you know other world leaders
[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:28.040]  and then Luke got mad went out sort of doing the same thing and now others are
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:33.160]  doing it and it is a chain reaction Luke it's a continuing spiral and you know
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:37.920]  I got a shout-out Matisse Rojas I mean confronted David Rockefeller in Chile I
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:43.160]  was talking to him years before and seeing other people take action stand up
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:47.600]  to themselves and believe in themselves and leave Chile now leave Chile we do

[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:52.640]  with the building what campaign now causing her all the Rivera to come out
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:57.480]  and say we need to look at 9-11 as an inside job now causing Judge Andrew
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:02.280]  Napolitano on Fox to come out and say he said it on my show first made national
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:06.400]  news that the official stories like the Kennedy story it's impossible I mean
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:13.000]  again taking action getting involved not in fighting getting in there getting in
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.600]  the globalist faces break that down for folks and we'll get into the Dick
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:21.280]  Cheney situation I mean it's just been such an inspiring and amazing ride I
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:24.640]  mean this life and just being an awakened has changed my life for the
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:27.920]  better so much and it's just been incredible I mean it started off with
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:32.160]  me getting beat up by the cops in New York City when I was 16 17 and ever since
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:36.040]  then I started looking into your work and you inspired me seeing your
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:40.280]  confrontation seeing your information that you provide to us every single day
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:43.840]  I take it and I run with it and it's about you know we all have the same
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:47.080]  potential within all of us we all have the same possibilities we could do
[02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:50.920]  anything we want nothing is impossible we just have to take it and run with it
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:54.800]  without fear only with compassion and devotion and we could do anything we
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:58.400]  want in this world and we did the impossible I mean we helped sponsor
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:02.680]  bills in Congress that helped not 11th responders we raised money for him we
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:06.000]  did that we do other you know community work here in the city and it's about
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:09.120]  making a difference not only for yourself not only changing yourself but
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:12.400]  changing the outside world and it starts with the individual sitting at home
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:16.000]  right now listening and and understanding that the power is within
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.040]  their own grasp within their own hands and what it's a big New Brzezinski say
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:24.080]  last year to the council on foreign relations televised on c-span he said
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:29.920]  for the first time in world history all of humanity is awake and staring they
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:34.400]  are now looking past the puppets to the Empire and then he broke down the blocks
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:39.400]  of the Empire we've gone from Ron Paul not getting one co-sponsor 15 16 years
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:43.200]  ago when he first got back into Congress he done one you know a term before that
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:48.320]  years before to now passing the audit in the house sure it got killed in the
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:52.280]  Senate but now people aren't looking at puppets more and more they're looking at
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:56.240]  the real power structure and once the majority of people see the real power
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:00.800]  structure and know it's the foreign banking occupation cartel game over
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:04.240]  it's over for them and people need to understand these people they're not as
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:08.320]  all-powerful I mean people people show them so much of you know so much
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:13.080]  affection people go up to them and you know they're done that dumb a blind like
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:16.840]  that girl in the big big Cheney video screaming we love you big Cheney thank
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:20.440]  you you know mr. Cheney you know but it takes this critical thinking it takes
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:24.640]  just to look things up and do your own research and do your own homework and
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:29.160]  just to find out how this is all just a big game and how really you know the
[02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:32.560]  biggest secret that they're hiding you know from all of us is that we have the
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:36.960]  power we have all the authority within us we could do what we want and that's
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:40.280]  what they're afraid of they're afraid of us waking up and understanding the
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:44.960]  power and the authority that we have within us to do what we want and they
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:47.680]  want to keep us depressed they want to keep us dumb they want to keep us
[02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:51.920]  fighting over stupid issues that don't even matter and it's about just
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:56.160]  understanding life is short and there has to be a better way that I know there
[02:11:56.160 --> 02:11:59.640]  is a better way and that's why I fight and I know that's why you fight and you
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:04.040]  know with commitment with just hard work we could do anything we want and that's
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:07.800]  why I'm you know I'm doing everything I can right now I have nothing else to do
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:12.320]  and I'm just gonna work really hard on we are change full-time I never been
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:16.880]  able to give my full potential to this yeah I told you years ago Luke and I
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:20.080]  guess what you started we are change what three years ago yeah about three
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:24.440]  years ago when I was 20 so I told you then I said a college degree is great
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:28.640]  but this is destiny here you're already making international headlines every
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:33.440]  week you're inspiring other people you got to create a foundation get donations
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:39.160]  and and and I even told you I said why give all the money you raised other
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:42.360]  things and then don't have money for video cameras and I'm having to send you
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:46.320]  you know four or five free video cameras you don't have money to travel I said
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:49.840]  people want to fund you know what you're doing as the founder of this and
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:53.440]  then others can start their own we are change that follows the code and the
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:58.720]  principles it's not some central control and they can go out and and and
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:04.640]  confront politicians but you need to do this full time and then make a film to
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:08.960]  then sell it to then fund yourself with that seed money to really get in a
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:13.000]  position where you can do this full time and I'm very excited to hear that
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.400]  you're doing that now now I want to get into the Dick Cheney situation but
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:21.480]  first before we go any further tell us about what's coming up this year the
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:26.120]  10th anniversary in New York City of the stage false flag terror attacks that
[02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:29.840]  were meant to drive a stake through the heart of our republic well this year is
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:33.760]  going to be one of the biggest years the fifth anniversary was the largest ever
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:37.280]  this is the 10th year anniversary we have to make a stand we have to do
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:40.640]  something huge we have to do something major all I know right now is that
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:45.760]  everybody should be in New York City on Sunday September 11 2011 we're going to
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:48.920]  be there making a stand we don't know if we're going to do event theater not but
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:52.480]  all I know is that we need to be a ground zero sending out our message now
[02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:56.600]  going out of silence being proud of what we stand for being proud of truth and
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:59.840]  justice and standing there with the family members standing there with the
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:03.840]  rescue workers so I hope everybody makes plans for New York City early we're
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:07.680]  going to make huge you know we're going to do huge things in New York City to
[02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:10.640]  try to get the truth out there to everybody and we're not backing down
[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:13.680]  we're not going to give up on that 11 you know people are always telling me
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:17.160]  oh talk about this don't talk about not 11 I'm never going to stop talking about
[02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:22.240]  not 11 truth is truth and and I don't care how you know well Luke 9 11 is the
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:26.680]  foundation of the wars the Patriot Act the naked body scanners the hands down
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:32.280]  the pants at the TSA it's the pretext for everything it must be exposed that
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:43.480]  that fraud that that false religious system of worshiping tyranny this cult
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:49.800]  of tyranny that 9 11 is a central to must fall but but we see 9 11 truth with
[02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:53.920]  more and more scientists more and more former Italian presidents former German
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:58.200]  defense ministers you know number three in the Japanese government I mean
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:02.920]  constantly former U.S. senators more and more prominent people what did you
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:07.360]  think about Geraldo Rivera having the building what campaign which our
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:11.120]  listeners donated to the very kickoff of our listeners again giving you the
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:15.040]  credit folks so they could get those ads on in New York saying building what
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:19.560]  building seven thirty second ad that her all the Rivera covers it then judge
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:22.760]  Napolitano comes on this show and says there's no way the official stories real
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:27.040]  we're being lied to even though that obviously will hurt the career at Fox
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:32.160]  they've got the humanity they can't help but tell the truth and 9 11 truth as
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:36.960]  Cass Sunstein at the White House admits is the number one threat to them and he
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:42.760]  wants you arrested this is public if you talk about it why they are so scared of
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:46.760]  this what is it like for you to see the not even rebirth because it was always
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:52.280]  growing but the acceleration of the waxing the expanding the exploding of
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:57.200]  9 11 truth and taking that tool of false flag terror away from the globalist
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:00.520]  where now anytime they stage an underwear bombing or something our
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:04.440]  listeners are on board they see the U.S. government getting on the plane the
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:07.760]  government denies it for two months and then it comes out that they did do it I
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:11.960]  mean this the people are having an awakening our people are everywhere
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:16.520]  inside the military the police on airplanes and the cockpit and in the
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:21.280]  passenger area and in the factories and on the borders and in the media I mean
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:25.600]  we got the popular mechanics article months before it came out from moles
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:33.680]  inside we get the hit pieces from MSNBC before they're out our people are
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:38.200]  everywhere it's so amazing seeing the lie being chipped away chip by chip just
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:42.960]  but little actions that we do and even having a lot of Rivera come out with the
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:47.640]  truth it was he was the last person I ever expected to come out in full
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:53.560]  support of you building what and and the hold 9 11 and just seeing that it was
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:57.240]  just so incredible especially after the incident me and you had with him in 2007
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:01.960]  and it's a problem Rivera could could come out and and you know openly talk
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:05.560]  about not 11 truth on his newscast the potential is amazing and that's why
[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:09.200]  cast on steam calls for the open infiltration of this not 11 truth
[02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:13.120]  movement openly calls for the government sending out this information to try to
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:16.240]  counter us and try to get rid of us that's why the starting poverty loss
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:19.960]  center puts on on patriots most want to list because they're afraid of us they
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:23.200]  have fear and one thing that we have that they don't have his love and
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:26.720]  compassion and they're afraid of that they're afraid of truth they're afraid
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:30.560]  of liberty and justice and that's why he's just so amazing it's just been such
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:35.440]  an incredible life-changing experience to see the difference in people I mean in
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:39.160]  New York City I started out with seven eight years ago at being a ground zero
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:43.360]  people spit at you people were mad and now it's totally different people are
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:47.040]  waking up to the ideas people are researching people are not just
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:50.560]  believing the lame stream media and they're going online and they're looking
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:53.760]  up real journalists who are going up to these people and asking them the real
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:57.360]  questions about not 11 and we're gonna be doing this full time we're not
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:18:01.520]  giving up you know and I feel so bad not being able to put my full potential
[02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:05.080]  into we are changed because of school and because of work but right now this is
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:08.440]  it I mean this is this is the time we're just getting started you're gonna see a
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:12.560]  whole bunch of new videos you're gonna see us organizing huge events and we're
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:15.920]  not backing down for this we're in this for the long run and we're not giving
[02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:19.880]  up until we have liberty until we have true freedom and until we accomplish
[02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:23.960]  what we want it which is a better life which is a better world for us and our
[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:29.400]  children for God's sake well you're right Luke and if we don't expose the
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:35.560]  narrative the hoax the fable the fiction of 9-11 it is what they're gonna be
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:39.040]  continuing to use to destroy our republic we're gonna go to break and come
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:45.480]  back and talk about the Dick Cheney situation but just briefly whatever

[02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:10.760]  incredible rush to help people what we're doing is we're educating people

[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:30.880]  even really report that he wins the straw poll and they show video people
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:34.480]  booing him a year ago and say that happened there Fox News has been caught

[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:50.280]  what did you think of how they were trying to treat Ron Paul Luke I mean I
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:54.000]  met a lot of amazing Ron Paul supporters they're incredible people and
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:57.840]  there are a lot of different neocons there who are just grimacing and we're
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:02.920]  so angry when he was speaking and you know it was just incredible I mean
[02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:07.280]  hearing Ron Paul speak inspired me so much I got a little interview with him
[02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:10.840]  too it's gonna be on we are changing a couple days you know we're gonna release
[02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:14.880]  the new skin rich video we confronted him on the bohemian grove there my
[02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:19.240]  friend Anthony and tello for we are changed Pennsylvania got Donald Rumsfeld
[02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:24.320]  on the 2.3 trillion that was missing and we came in there first day and we
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:28.360]  pretty much wreck havoc the first day and then the next day we came back they
[02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:32.160]  pretty much set up fake walls so we couldn't get anywhere near these
[02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:36.280]  people see Cass Sunstein wants to infiltrate us we're infiltrating them
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:40.120]  and they can't stand it we're on the March they're on the run yeah and there
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:43.480]  are so many amazing people out there who are aware of the work who are you
[02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:46.960]  know supporting us who were giving us tips where all the other politicians were
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:51.280]  and the CPAC people I mean they literally had to put up fake walls from
[02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:55.120]  one exit to another exit so all these politicians wouldn't have anybody
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:58.280]  coming up to them and asking them questions and I'm just so proud to have
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:02.320]  everybody there with you know Danny Panzella and James Lane and so many other
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:06.480]  great activists out there and we pretty much wrecked havoc at CPAC and we
[02:26:06.480 --> 02:26:09.760]  pretty much took it over with the questions the Ron Paul people were
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:13.920]  amazing and it was just one of the best experiences in my life seeing so many
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:18.440]  people caring for liberty caring for freedom and you know standing and Cheney
[02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:22.200]  got booed when he was on stage then confronted over and over again it lets
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:25.840]  them know wherever they go in the world they're getting confronted that we are
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:30.800]  aware of them and it really makes them back off at many levels they've backed
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:34.120]  off on trying to get our guns because they know we're waking up they're
[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:37.840]  backing off of so many issues Luke in closing and again the videos that we
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:42.840]  are change.org it's also an info wars.com Cheney tried to starlet you but
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:46.520]  didn't put his head down and kind of just crawled off into the elevator I mean
[02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:50.480]  you got right in his face but calmly let him know that you're aware that he was
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:55.000]  involved in 9-11 it was it was an incredible feeling and the rush that I
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:00.120]  got after that you know adrenaline was just so powerful so amazing and I'm
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:03.560]  one thing I just hope you know don't thank me for doing it the biggest
[02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:06.800]  thanks you could give me is going out there yourself and confronting your
[02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:10.520]  local politician your local congressman don't thank me I'm just one
[02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:14.960]  individual doing it I'm not perfect I made mistakes you know I'm I don't ask
[02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:19.000]  the best questions English is my second language for God's sake and I messed up
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.440]  big time too because I messed up on John Bolton and Alan West my microphone
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:27.120]  wasn't working and so many other ones but we're gonna have some good stuff
[02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:30.680]  out there and one thing I just hope out of all this is when you see it you know
[02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:33.960]  I hope it inspires you to take action and to go out there and to do it
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:37.360]  yourself because we're taking back the mainstream media we are the mainstream
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:41.160]  media we're going out there and asking the real questions and people are aware
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:44.680]  of that and people are paying attention and it's up to us just to keep working
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:49.000]  keep busting our humps and well out there well that brings me to this last
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:53.960]  point Sunstein the regulations aren't the White House and others they've been
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:57.640]  admittedly building the cyber security takeover the web they're now admitting
[02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:01.400]  it's to shut the web off and to slowly start curtailing it they can do either
[02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:06.160]  they're telling us oh have freedom of the internet in Egypt when Google's over
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:11.000]  there running the overthrow of their old apprentice their old puppet now USA
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:15.320]  today has the headline kill switch internet bill alarms privacy experts
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:18.400]  and they just go on and admit yeah they're getting ready to put in the power
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:22.240]  to shut off the web they're scared of the American people they definitely are
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:25.160]  and I'm not afraid of their you know internet kill switch I know there's
[02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:29.920]  so many great hackers out there so many tech geeks out there who know other
[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:34.000]  forms of communications who know how to bypass a lot of different things so they
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:38.320]  have micro FM there's hanging up flyers the more they try to suppress and bury
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:42.840]  the truth the more it's gonna stand out for people exactly they more the more
[02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:46.600]  they try to stop us the more we grow so you know they can't they can't really
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:50.160]  do anything to us they know they messed up they know that we're doing the right
[02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:54.400]  thing peacefully non-violently they know we're the ones trying to take back this
[02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:58.000]  country and make a better life for everybody and they know they really
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:02.040]  made a big mistake and they're pretty much screwed and it's up to all of us
[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:06.200]  to take advantage of the situation and to just go out there and to you know be
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:09.600]  the full potential that we are that we all can't be within all and inside of
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:14.800]  us well Luke be the change you want to see in the world first they ignore you
[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:19.120]  then they attack you then they laugh at you then you win resistance is victory
[02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:23.200]  and you and and all the great folks that have led by your example are the
[02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:27.480]  testament to that and so you didn't even talk about the death threats you get
[02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:31.000]  your family getting death threats the things you've gone through to get the
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:36.080]  truth out but it's the only choice we've got it's freedom or slavery and you

[02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:12.400]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:16.680]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:21.040]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:32:21.040 --> 02:32:25.120]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:29.680]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:33.800]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[02:33:23.200 --> 02:33:28.080]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen Gerald Salente for the next 30 minutes
[02:33:28.080 --> 02:33:31.840]  is our guest founder of the Trends Research Institute really need to know
[02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:35.560]  introduction here and of course many years ago he predicted the commodity
[02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:40.400]  prices the oil the food going up triggering food riots he of course
[02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:45.280]  predicted the Tea Party rising several years before it did and he is a
[02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:50.240]  frequent contributor to our radio broadcast and I wanted to get him on
[02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:55.600]  about Egypt about the economy this new giant budget all these huge tax
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:34:03.480]  increases like 69% on state income tax in Illinois the austerity where they
[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:08.880]  raise the taxes but cut the benefits the the governor of Wisconsin coming out on
[02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:14.800]  NPR on Monday and saying oh if state employees don't like their pay being
[02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:18.640]  slashed and us taking more of their money for the pension fund we'll just call
[02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:23.400]  the National Guard out on them and some say yeah cut their pay that'll pay off
[02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:28.880]  the deficit it's it's the derivatives that's 1.5 quadrillion you could cut
[02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:32.880]  everything and it wouldn't pay for even a few percentage points of it we don't
[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:37.760]  owe this money and so Gerald has broken all this down but I wanted to go over it
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:41.000]  and give us the big picture geopolitically of what's happening and
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:45.800]  continuing to tweak his trends forecast what he sees coming up in the next few
[02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:49.440]  months here in the United States Gerald great having you with us hey thanks
[02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:53.640]  Alex you've got the floor what do you want to cover first well let's look at
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:59.400]  Egypt first if you go back to our trends journal we've been predicting this about
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:05.600]  two years ago we came out with workers of the world unite 2.0 this has nothing
[02:35:05.600 --> 02:35:11.840]  to do with democracy theocracy it has to do with the bottom line and the bottom
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:19.040]  line is this when the money stops flowing down to Main Street the blood
[02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:26.040]  begins to flow on the streets and the money is not flowing down we're looking
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:36.040]  at for example in Egypt the per capita wage the the average wage of an
[02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:44.080]  Egyptian is $10 a day that's according to the Egyptian statistics now you see
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:49.200]  food prices going up you got a lot of angry people because the cream at the
[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:54.080]  top of the pyramid if you will they're taking all the dough so what we wrote
[02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:59.600]  about also in the trends journal that you have the winter edition that went
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:07.000]  out just weeks before days actually before the Tunisian uprisings we sent
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:13.520]  out a synopsis one of them was youth of the world unite and I've been talking
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:20.000]  to about this on your show as well here these kids figure it out you have a 50
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:26.520]  percent unemployment rate in Spain probably in Italy it's around 35 the
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:33.680]  kids angry they have college degrees in worthlessness there's no job future they
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:37.520]  they can have this white shoe boy language I love it you brought it up
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:43.760]  austerity measures here's some austerity measures we're going to cut the minimum
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:49.360]  wage as they did in Ireland 12% they're not making anything that anyway let's
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:54.720]  cut it lower we're going to increase the cost of everything all the services all
[02:36:54.720 --> 02:36:59.640]  the licensing fees will be after you for every little thing you do wrong and
[02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:05.760]  you'll pay more for it and we're going to cut services oh and by the way those
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:10.560]  pensions we're going to cut those along with their benefits and your retirement
[02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:16.400]  age I got a good one for you we're going to increase the retirement age till
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:22.400]  after you die how's that oh one other thing we're going to raise taxes across
[02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:27.680]  the board and we have to do this because the white shoe boys I love the language
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:33.520]  they don't want to take a haircut on the bed bets that they made so you have to
[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:38.840]  pay them off what's going on and as we said off with their heads 2.0 the
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:43.480]  autumn trends journal what's going on in Tunisia what's going on in Egypt it's
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:49.440]  not it's not Arab exclusive you know our it is a beginning of it's going to go
[02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:54.160]  to Europe as we said you know Alex remember when you were a kid they taught
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:38:00.800]  you in school World War one began when they assassinated the Archduke Ferdinand
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:05.360]  and Sarajevo and yet the multiple-choice junk you know you had to figure it out
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:12.080]  the dates now it didn't they were brush fires the aristocracy started losing
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:16.200]  their money and they started trying to steal it from everybody else and they're
[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:22.160]  doing the same thing now we are on the doorstep of the first great war the
[02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:28.120]  spring trends journal of the 20th century the brush fires are starting in
[02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:35.360]  Tunisia they're starting in Egypt they're starting in Bahrain in Iran in
[02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:47.000]  Libya Algeria Morocco Greece Spain Portugal Italy the UK you're going to see
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:53.440]  uprisings around the world as the little people start getting squeezed more
[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:58.360]  and more well Gerald now the UK's reporting 4% increase in inflation a
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:02.560]  month and that's even the government's own cook numbers we're getting more
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:07.480]  reports every day of TSA agents planting drugs on people sexually harassing them
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:12.560]  one guy stole 160,000 reportedly from check bags I mean we're just seeing more
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:18.880]  and more corruption come out and now every major Islamic nation in the
[02:39:18.880 --> 02:39:25.080]  Middle East is is in turmoil that is spreading in fact here are some of the
[02:39:25.080 --> 02:39:29.560]  headlines Egypt's protest flair despite military warning anti-government
[02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:33.360]  protests spread to Libya thousands of police confront protesters in Yemen
[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:38.680]  protests just spreading all over Saudi Arabia Bahrain protesters urge more
[02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:44.440]  pressure a 100 Egyptians reach Italy amid Arab exodus Carter says Muslim
[02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:49.280]  Brotherhood nothing to be afraid of but but but so the social engineers knew
[02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:52.640]  that these upheavals were about to happen because of food prices their own
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:57.280]  reports admitted that so they went in and triggered the overthrow of Mubarak
[02:39:57.280 --> 02:40:00.400]  thinking they're gonna control it but clearly they're not going to be able to
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:04.400]  control it and you talked about war in the Middle East being the answer to this
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:09.080]  depression clearly the social engineers are trying to nudge this crisis in a
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:13.720]  direction they can control and then they will pose as the arbiters or the
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:19.080]  referees of the unfolding crisis I don't know if it's being engineered I think
[02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:22.680]  the whole thing's out of control the way I see they know it's out of control so
[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:25.600]  they're so they went ahead and triggered it oh yeah they're gonna
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:30.680]  engineer it I mean let's go back let's play back the Egyptian uprising as it
[02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:37.000]  began we heard from Joe Biden right he said that Mubarak wasn't a dictator and
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:42.240]  he should stay in office I looked about how long was Mubarak in for 30 years you
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:48.000]  know how long Biden's been sucking off the public tit 36 years of course he
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.800]  wasn't a dictator not to Biden he's been living his whole life on the on the on
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:58.640]  off us and 40 billion of our dollars going over there and then you heard
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:05.640]  Hillary Clinton say it has to be a orderly transition they have to get their
[02:41:05.640 --> 02:41:12.200]  roles together the voting roles so now you're hearing champions for democracy
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:18.760]  I've never seen that's the engineering is this this hypocrisy the hypocrisy
[02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:24.320]  coming out of Washington they supported this guy for 30 years and here's the
[02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:28.360]  other thing that everybody should really be furious at we were mentioning
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:33.720]  about Obama's new budget was about 50 billion going into foreign aid let me
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:38.800]  tell you what foreign aid is foreign aid is your money that you work for every
[02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:43.720]  day they take it out of your pocket and then they send it to their buddies
[02:41:43.720 --> 02:41:50.560]  overseas that they want to do deals with that's all it is grow up about this so
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:56.560]  let's stop this foreign aid baloney because Egypt got 40 billion of hours
[02:41:56.560 --> 02:42:02.040]  what is Israel getting 3 billion plus a year I don't want my money going anywhere
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:08.520]  how about this how about sending it to Detroit there's a war zone well
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:13.680]  meanwhile we have US troops being shot at US police being killed US diplomats
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:18.880]  US ICE agents and the media is not worried about that the government's not
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:22.960]  worried about that Mexican troops now coming across the US border and
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:28.480]  searching citizens at checkpoints but we have telescreens going in Walmart
[02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:31.800]  telling a spy on our neighbors they're now gonna have Homeland Security
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:37.040]  announcements during NBA basketball games trying to make Janet Napolitano some
[02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:44.440]  type of rock star we have just just all of this going on TSA robbing people it
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:51.400]  it's just it really is scary how corrupt this society is going summing it up
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:55.960]  where do you see America in a month six months a year two years I mean you've
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:43:02.040]  talked about revolution tax rebellions you talked about it years before it came
[02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:06.440]  now it's starting where do you see it going well on the one end is what you
[02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:09.920]  are talking about they're gonna clamp down on us more and more again the
[02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:14.200]  hypocrisy Hillary Clinton talking about the freedom of the internet whether
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:18.160]  clamping down on this end and in the trends journal there's that wonderful
[02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:22.840]  piece in the winter edition by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts loss of liberty that's
[02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:26.880]  where it's going so it's hard to say if there's going to be revolts in this
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:32.280]  country because we see the hypocrisy as they were talking about let the people
[02:43:32.280 --> 02:43:37.640]  in Egypt revolt you know don't don't you know come down on the journalists what
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:41.920]  do they do in this country look what happened at the G20 meetings in in
[02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:47.080]  Pittsburgh a few years ago they closed down the whole city you couldn't
[02:43:47.080 --> 02:43:51.200]  protest all those goons squads maybe they should bring in the Egypt and it
[02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:54.920]  turned out in Canada the police were lying when they said no protest allowed
[02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:59.800]  that a special law had been passed turned out they were just lying here's USA
[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:04.520]  today kill switch internet bill alarms privacy experts the government's
[02:44:04.520 --> 02:44:08.320]  openly saying they want to be able to shut the internet off and they're getting
[02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:11.640]  ready to launch a false flag against the web there's no doubt about that no
[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:15.880]  doubt about it they're going to launch a bigger false flag it's going to be
[02:44:15.880 --> 02:44:21.040]  terrorism a war mark my words yeah let's for anybody that has a attention
[02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:26.680]  deficit disorder or suffering from Alzheimer's disease or living in you
[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:33.200]  know a little kid that can't put it together remember the main Saddam Hussein
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:39.960]  has weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda oh here's one for you the
[02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:45.400]  Gulf of Tonkin remember that beautiful lie they'll lie about anything they'll
[02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:50.560]  take you to war and that's what that this is what we wrote about Alex it back
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:57.880]  in 2008 when the whole bailout scams began we said when the bailout bubbles
[02:44:57.880 --> 02:45:06.360]  burst the next stop is war we're heading toward the first great war of the 21st
[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:13.920]  century you mentioned about the Zaret Janet Napolitano that bureaucratic you
[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:20.320]  know when she knows a lot about security you know she's really on time and you
[02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:25.760]  know what look what they don't doing look at Obama's budget they're increasing
[02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:30.880]  Homeland Security they're not cutting defense right they announced tens of
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:35.280]  billions of dollars for more naked body scanners to roll out on the streets the
[02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:41.960]  courthouses everywhere everywhere in the cities in the states more money to
[02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:49.360]  control you and me that's all this is about as they lose control they take
[02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:54.960]  more control let's look more at the budget defense they're cutting defense I
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:46:00.600]  love it they go 78 billion dollars then you read it 78 billion dollars over five
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:04.680]  years so what are we talking about 15 billion dollars now let's add in let's
[02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:10.920]  add in some inflation into that they're increasing the defense budget so what
[02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:15.840]  they're doing is they're taking the money and they're putting it more into
[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:22.240]  apparatuses that control us more so you when you ask me what is it going to look
[02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:28.480]  like they're going to control us more and more and clamp down on dissent more
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:35.920]  and more on the financial end the we had warned as other people have about the
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:42.040]  rampant inflation you mentioned the UK 4% you look what's going on in India in
[02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:48.000]  China what are these protests about people can't put food in their mouth
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:55.120]  food prices are at all-time highs and they're earning all-time lows the reason
[02:46:55.120 --> 02:47:06.040]  the reason for this inflation is not only supply and demand it's because kitties
[02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:12.160]  commodities are based in dollars and now we have the French thank me devalue the
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:20.200]  dollar so everything else is going up they're robbing you and now Gerald the
[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:23.680]  head of the G20 the French minister came out and said dump the dollar a month
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:28.920]  ago who gentile and now that consensus is there to go ahead and get rid of the
[02:47:28.920 --> 02:47:33.880]  dollar in the next year or so is the World Reserve currency but like cockroaches
[02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:37.200]  when they've been sprayed with poison you know they start running around even
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:41.680]  faster the system is even flooding the world even that much faster and we see
[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:46.280]  inflation rearing its head here which hurts people on fixed incomes you name
[02:47:46.280 --> 02:47:51.000]  it I mean anyway you slice it this is going to be a disaster it is oh by the
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:54.520]  way there's no inflation look at all those people out there that have
[02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:59.040]  haven't gotten cola increases you know this is the Arizona judge not
[02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:04.840]  leetano show he's one of my favorites last week I said this is the USA I mean
[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:09.400]  you can't make this stuff up how could you say there's no inflation you know
[02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:13.840]  and then it began under Clinton and they keep the lie going there's rampant
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:19.280]  inflation anybody that works and and pays the things every day again not the
[02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:22.800]  billionaires and the multi-millionaires you know they don't know the price of a
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:29.020]  gallon of gasoline is so what we're seeing here is insidious inflation and
[02:48:29.020 --> 02:48:34.400]  by the way the Europeans are as responsible for this as the American
[02:48:34.400 --> 02:48:38.440]  central bank they're doing the same thing they're flooding the market with
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:42.520]  cheap money because again I mean yeah I'm not making this stuff up go to
[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:47.560]  Bloomberg it's even there today they're worried about the financiers getting
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:52.520]  haircuts I mean so they're flooding more money into the system and the big
[02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:56.280]  central banks are making record profits what do you think about Ron Paul
[02:48:56.280 --> 02:49:01.400]  shifting gears going into this year's election he won the CPAC poll two years
[02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:06.520]  in a row they reared an old video of him being booed and played it on Fox and
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:10.920]  said that that's what happened this year when he won I mean this was a hoax that
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:16.080]  they ran they are really scared of him you know I be getting some emails from
[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:20.600]  young people who were attended that actually and and and one of them was
[02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:25.720]  very insightful saying how the young people really don't like the Republican
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:30.520]  Party at all and they're really Ron Paul supporters and that's what the core of
[02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:34.840]  this country is moving toward yeah as a matter of fact you've heard me say the
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:41.320]  phrase before progressive libertarian and a matter of fact judge Andrew Napolitano
[02:49:41.320 --> 02:49:46.480]  had on Ron Paul and Ralph Nader he told me it was what he got more responses
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:52.000]  from that show just about for many other one that's the direction progressive in
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:58.960]  terms of the environment oh by the way all you Obama lovers you wimpo crats out
[02:49:58.960 --> 02:50:04.480]  there you know your your key sheet ingridden obama and balsamic smile
[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:12.600]  people Obama's cutting the EPA budget by an estimated 30% how's that for some
[02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:17.920]  more change you can't believe in so what we're seeing is the revolution is
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:23.760]  going to come from these educated young people who want to become involved and
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:29.000]  they are the Ron Paul supporters I'll tell you my dream ticket would be a Ron
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:34.280]  Paul someone like a Ralph Nader and a secretary of state like a judge Andrew
[02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:39.400]  Napolitano I'm on a lot of shows you as you well know Alex I respect him more
[02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:43.720]  than and on the mainstream media I'm talking about I respect him more than

[02:54:20.560 --> 02:54:23.880]  last week went ahead and expanded the security prosperity partnership North
[02:54:23.880 --> 02:54:28.320]  American Union to say we have a continental security perimeter using the
[02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:33.200]  crises in Mexico they've engineered we see just continued evidence of the
[02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:37.880]  depression unfolding in the last four minutes or so that we have left what
[02:54:37.880 --> 02:54:43.640]  else do you think is most important on your radar screen or what other tidbits
[02:54:43.640 --> 02:54:47.880]  do you want to impart to folks right now well this is really a time to be
[02:54:47.880 --> 02:54:52.920]  vigilant something we believe is going to happen of a very large magnitude
[02:54:52.920 --> 02:54:57.760]  again we're not alarmist we're not Monday morning quarterbacks we call the
[02:54:57.760 --> 02:55:01.920]  shots before they happen with these riots that are now taking place in
[02:55:01.920 --> 02:55:07.440]  Tunisia and Egypt we said it that it would be young people it would be and
[02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:11.920]  we said and this time the revolution will not only be televised it'll be
[02:55:11.920 --> 02:55:17.440]  Twitter Facebook and YouTube and so people really need to know watch what's
[02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:23.440]  going on very closely and then going back to the Obama lie and again your
[02:55:23.440 --> 02:55:28.840]  Obama deception or that that should that that documentary should win awards
[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:35.160]  because you really nailed it is so so early on and anybody that hasn't seen
[02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:41.040]  that I I really highly recommend that they they show it to everyone that they
[02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:44.960]  know who still believes in the great lie and here's another part of the great
[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:51.760]  lie when Obama became president he said that they've earmarked two trillion
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:56.440]  dollars worth of savings that they saw in the federal budget well obviously they
[02:55:56.440 --> 02:56:00.480]  never came through with that because they weren't there and then he they said
[02:56:00.480 --> 02:56:05.680]  according to the congressional budget office in 2009 that you know what the
[02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:11.120]  deficit would be in two in 2011 according to their projections five hundred
[02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:17.840]  billion dollars what is it oh it's estimated to be 1.6 trillion dollars so
[02:56:17.840 --> 02:56:23.080]  the lies that are coming out right in front of our face are beyond the belief
[02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:27.800]  of anything that you could make up and as I said what we're most concerned about
[02:56:27.800 --> 02:56:34.720]  now is something is going to happen or a real it's either going to be a terrorism
[02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:40.040]  or a call to war at some level and by the way did you I only saw it once I
[02:56:40.040 --> 02:56:44.400]  haven't had time to follow up on it about Petraeus leaving Afghanistan is
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:49.560]  that true well there's calls for them to try to start pulling out and then
[02:56:49.560 --> 02:56:53.560]  perhaps removing Petraeus but I trace himself leaving I haven't confirmed that
[02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:59.760]  no oh because I saw something come across on that and if that that what the
[02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:04.160]  point that I'm making is that these are losing wars and they're losing in
[02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:10.940]  Pakistan in that CIA drone war they're losing in Afghanistan and there's no
[02:57:10.940 --> 02:57:15.680]  end in sight in Iraq something we believe is going to happen so what I'm
[02:57:15.680 --> 02:57:21.320]  saying is that I believe when it does happen they're going to close down the
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:26.520]  banks and they close down Wall Street when 9-11 happened this time is going
[02:57:26.520 --> 02:57:32.120]  to be a run-on cash run-on ATM so I would just suggest to people that you
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:36.800]  know have your e-foods have your survival gear in place because if the worst
[02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:40.760]  doesn't and have money on hand and have you good you know I believe in gold as
[02:57:40.760 --> 02:57:44.640]  you know you're saying this depression could it could really accelerate and
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:49.560]  become a complete meltdown yes that's all they need that's all we need now is
[02:57:49.560 --> 02:57:55.880]  a geopolitical flashpoint and this thing on Ravel's bam the bottom falls out so
[02:57:55.880 --> 02:58:00.760]  what I'm saying is that if the worst doesn't happen at least you're prepared
[02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:06.200]  absolutely in closing in closing David Petraeus quitting the Times of London
[02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:10.440]  is reporting that he is going to be stepping down sometime near the end of
[02:58:10.440 --> 02:58:15.920]  the year but now the Pentagon is denying that so who knows what the truth is
[02:58:15.920 --> 02:58:20.480]  Gerald who knows what the truth is and and so the point being if you don't
[02:58:20.480 --> 02:58:26.560]  prepare now you could lose everything the stock market is a rigged game only
[02:58:26.560 --> 02:58:31.000]  little kids believe that they could play it and win it because we're not with the
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:35.840]  high-frequency trading the dark pools everybody knows what's going on and
