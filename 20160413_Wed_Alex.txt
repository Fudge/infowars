[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:10.000 --> 00:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ted Cruz is escalating his propaganda war as he steals the election with the RNC as he steals the Republican nomination or attempts to a new level.
[00:22.000 --> 00:37.000]  I have a clip coming up where Cruz says he's winning every single election and is ahead and that Trump is a sore loser even though he has hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of more delegates than him.
[00:37.000 --> 00:53.000]  And that this is democracy that Trump is fighting, but they never mentioned, by the way, we just got all the superdelegates that announced in Colorado and other states they're ignoring what the actual delegates said that they were representing.
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  But that's a cart before the horse in Colorado because they never even had the primary.
[00:59.000 --> 01:10.000]  But then the delegates say, actually we want Trump and they go, no, no, no, the superdelegates that we just pulled out of a hat, they now vote for Cruz.
[01:11.000 --> 01:17.000]  And then Matt Drudge comes out and says, you know, this looks pretty bad. He didn't even say that. He links to the headlines, you know, no voters needed.
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.000]  And the conniption fit begins with Cruz calling Trump a La Cosa Nostra Sicilian mobster.
[01:23.000 --> 01:36.000]  Well, I mean, Trump's not even Italian, but why are you dragging Italians into this or Sicilians into this? It's just bizarre.
[01:36.000 --> 01:56.000]  I mean, it's kind of like saying Trump's in the Mexican mafia. I don't know what it means. It's just or Trump's in the crypts and the bloods. It's just some gutter level deal that he thinks appeals to people like when he said, we don't lock you New Yorkers down here in the south.
[01:56.000 --> 02:11.000]  That'd be kind of a shameful statement if it was a Southerner or a real Texan, but he's from Canada. And I'm just really tired of folks from other countries going, yeah, boy, got my cowboy hat, got my snake skin boots.
[02:11.000 --> 02:29.000]  I tell you one thing right now, there's one thing I like to do my lariat. Well, I didn't rope me a steer and cook it up for dinner out there at the Chuck wagon. How long has it been since you had a big old steaming bowl?
[02:29.000 --> 02:42.000]  Ted Cruz BS. Well, that's too long, isn't it? So we're going to come back with the main launch, the transmission today, and it is going to be amazing.
[02:43.000 --> 02:56.000]  It's exclusive at the New York Times, exclusive at Politico. Everywhere has the big headline, Roger Stone, Trump delegates should sign a loyalty pledge.
[02:56.000 --> 03:08.000]  He broke that here yesterday. I mean, I'm not bragging that we just keep having the exclusives with Roger Stone. I just love how the media is calling an exclusive.
[03:08.000 --> 03:25.000]  Here is the actual video full 45 minute interview, 46 minute interview up on infowars.com. It's got a headline that would think a submarine though. Tricky Ted Cruz lies more than Nixon, Roger Stone.
[03:26.000 --> 03:33.000]  You know, that's kind of an interesting headline on the interview, but the interview really is about the future of the Trump campaign, the attempt until the election and the headline.
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  My fault. I should be coming up with these headlines because I just get shell shocked by the end of the show and there's always breaking news here.
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  And I don't really realize how important it is or go tell folks the headlines or go have somebody write an article about it.
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  But it's okay because then everybody else does. So at least the news gets out and that's what's important.
[03:49.000 --> 03:59.000]  But it reminds us what we all do as citizens, as voters, as mothers, as fathers, as humans. We get so close to tyranny fighting it that we almost become comfortable with it.
[03:59.000 --> 04:08.000]  Even when we're having victories. We're having sensational victories against the tyrants, but we don't really stop and then celebrate those victories.
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  Congress has a 9% approval rating. Yay.
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.000]  Their illegitimate run by foreign interest. People know the Federal Reserve is private now on average. They know there's a global government being formed.
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  They know they're shielding the election. We're forcing a fight.
[04:23.000 --> 04:30.000]  They wanted to just say there's no agenda 21. There's no global government. There's no banker bailouts. There's no credit to false swaps.
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.000]  I would talk about derivatives with banking experts 19 years ago. I didn't learn about it until the first few years I was on air.
[04:38.000 --> 04:44.000]  A couple years on air. I started learning about it and I would have these banking experts on. Incredible stuff. Lawyers, you name it.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  People would write articles saying I was making it up.
[04:47.000 --> 04:57.000]  Well, now we know credit to false swaps were real. It's all rigged and we're just having that wake up process. The world's waking up together right now.
[05:17.000 --> 05:24.000]  A gold medal for new technologies and moonshines for the field testing for use of mobile telephones and portable electronic devices while driving after an accident or collision.
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  After being involved in an accident a driver would have to submit their phone for roadside testing or face and automatic suspension of their license.
[05:29.000 --> 05:36.000]  That testing would be done anonymously Using a device that would only look at metadata.
[05:37.000 --> 05:43.000]  Yeah, sure buddy. The actual content of a message picture or game would not be revealed. Yeah, I don't believe that one.
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.920]  that one. Seeing as how the NSA and others are putting their fingers at everything. A
[05:46.920 --> 05:51.480]  driver under suspicion of distracted driving will be under extreme pressure to unlock their
[05:51.480 --> 05:56.200]  phone to prove their innocence, giving officers full access to everything on a handset. You
[05:56.200 --> 05:58.400]  can find more reports like this at ImpleWars.com.
[05:58.400 --> 05:59.400]  Hey, how you doing?
[05:59.400 --> 06:00.400]  Good, brother.
[06:00.400 --> 06:04.000]  Just recently started using your products. Everything you said about them is correct.
[06:04.000 --> 06:08.000]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[06:08.000 --> 06:11.400]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know
[06:11.400 --> 06:13.400]  I've got to have the highest quality.
[06:13.400 --> 06:19.320]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[06:19.320 --> 06:21.320]  of using synthetic chemicals.
[06:21.320 --> 06:26.480]  We do the supermale and the superfemale vitality. Big changes, a lot of energy. We've gotten
[06:26.480 --> 06:31.000]  off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.720]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated or
[06:36.720 --> 06:41.920]  maximum potency. They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover
[06:41.920 --> 06:45.680]  that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets
[06:45.680 --> 06:50.040]  your glands naturally going goes right to the source. So it's pretty exciting and I
[06:50.040 --> 06:51.040]  love it.

[08:57.480 --> 09:03.000]  Thank you so much for joining us as we broadcast coast to coast, border to border and worldwide.
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.280]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[09:08.280 --> 09:11.480]  In our fight against the globalists, it's time to double up or quit.
[09:11.480 --> 09:15.760]  We are having major victories, we are exposing them, we are making them reveal themselves
[09:15.760 --> 09:21.680]  as the larceness, vicious tyrants they are.
[09:21.680 --> 09:26.320]  A lot of positive things are happening right now.
[09:26.320 --> 09:32.520]  Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers, former member of Ron Paul's operation, good friend
[09:32.520 --> 09:38.480]  of mine, Patriot, will be joining us to talk about a new film that is going to be premiering
[09:38.480 --> 09:43.960]  in Texas and it's important that when it premieres in theaters that it sell out because then
[09:43.960 --> 09:48.320]  other theaters around the country will pick it up and it could really be an effective
[09:48.320 --> 09:49.320]  situation.
[09:49.320 --> 09:54.760]  Kamal Salim will also be joining us and Chuck Undersea, the maker of the film, David Knight
[09:54.760 --> 09:57.880]  will be hosting the fourth hour.
[09:57.880 --> 10:04.840]  And guess who's in the film, Revelation Dawn of Global Government.
[10:04.840 --> 10:10.440]  Michael Boykin, former head of Special Forces, founder of Delta Force, you name it.
[10:10.440 --> 10:16.400]  We've got Stuart Rhodes, Kamal Salim, Chuck Undersea, obviously directed it, yours truly
[10:16.400 --> 10:17.400]  Alex Jones.
[10:17.400 --> 10:20.280]  I'm kind of almost like the narrator of it.
[10:20.280 --> 10:25.120]  And then we've also got, well, everybody else.
[10:25.120 --> 10:32.040]  We've got the Motor City Madman, Ted Nugent, Ron Paul, Ron Paul went and watched a private
[10:32.040 --> 10:36.560]  screening of it this last weekend, in fact, Chuck Undersea sent me some amazing photos.
[10:36.560 --> 10:40.000]  I want to give you guys so we can tweet them and Facebook them out.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.440]  I have no position in this film, you know, that is, I don't own the film, I'm not invested
[10:43.440 --> 10:44.440]  in it.
[10:44.440 --> 10:48.120]  When it comes out on Blu-ray and DVD, we will sell it at infowarstore.com.
[10:48.120 --> 10:54.800]  But Chuck Undersea has, he used to be a TV producer and make big national TV commercials.
[10:54.800 --> 10:58.920]  And he's also a retired Army Colonel.
[10:58.920 --> 11:03.880]  He's a patriot, a Texan, and he's put everything he's got into this film, everything.
[11:03.880 --> 11:06.320]  He spent three years making it or longer.
[11:06.320 --> 11:10.040]  And so that's why I'm promoting it, because it's really designed to wake up somebody who's
[11:10.040 --> 11:11.800]  not aware of what's going on.
[11:11.800 --> 11:17.200]  And it's got a lot of amazing sequences shot in and it's got a reenactor of George Washington
[11:17.200 --> 11:20.240]  who looks just like George Washington is, just as tall as George Washington.
[11:20.240 --> 11:22.000]  We've had him in studio before.
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.680]  So that is coming up in the second and third hour today, but we're not going to talk about
[11:27.680 --> 11:31.240]  the film or play some first ever excerpts here, sneak peeks.
[11:31.240 --> 11:35.000]  We are also going to be tying it into what's currently happening and affecting the future
[11:35.000 --> 11:42.640]  battle space as the globalist attempt to take over our constitutional republic completely.
[11:42.640 --> 11:47.760]  Now, let me go ahead and break down some of the news that is coming up, obviously.
[11:47.760 --> 11:53.320]  I want to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour to get your view on the big election
[11:53.320 --> 11:54.320]  steal.
[11:54.320 --> 12:01.000]  There is powerful video up on drugsreport.com of the Colorado Election Day revealed where
[12:01.000 --> 12:09.360]  it shows the unanimous vote for Ted Cruz by the appointed superdelegates ignoring the
[12:09.360 --> 12:12.160]  real delegates who didn't even get to represent voters.
[12:12.160 --> 12:14.960]  So it's frauds within frauds within frauds.
[12:14.960 --> 12:18.600]  Delegates were decided 10 seconds at a time.
[12:18.600 --> 12:25.720]  Trump calls process a disgrace, Cruz email asked for $35 to be top deputy delegate.
[12:25.720 --> 12:34.160]  That's right, Cruz is now offering not to pay off delegates, but offering to be part
[12:34.160 --> 12:35.880]  of his operation as a voter.
[12:35.880 --> 12:41.000]  If you're one of his minions, he will bring you in and then claim that you are a real
[12:41.000 --> 12:42.000]  delegate.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.800]  So I guess they want actors, basically, to play the part of delegates is what he's recruiting
[12:45.800 --> 12:51.600]  as an army of people to say, here are my delegates, but you have to pay to be one of his gang
[12:51.600 --> 12:53.680]  members, I guess.
[12:53.680 --> 12:58.040]  So people are really flipping out.
[12:58.040 --> 13:03.680]  Here's some of the stories up on infowars.com 2016, the year the Americans found out our
[13:03.680 --> 13:13.560]  elections are rigged, ah, the illusion of choice, the scales coming off the eyes, a big
[13:13.560 --> 13:18.880]  story that we broke here yesterday, now in Breitbart, New York Times, Politico, you name
[13:18.880 --> 13:22.720]  it, see the full video interview with Roger Stone at the bottom of the article.
[13:22.720 --> 13:28.280]  Roger Stone, Trump delegates should sign a loyalty pledge.
[13:28.280 --> 13:32.080]  Very, very powerful article, one of the most powerful he's written in a long time.
[13:32.080 --> 13:35.240]  And again, there's an article written around the exclusive interview where he first broke
[13:35.240 --> 13:36.240]  it here.
[13:36.240 --> 13:39.800]  Just pointing out, you normally a lot of times hear stuff here first, we're very proud of
[13:39.800 --> 13:45.960]  that fact, to not just be analyzing news or going out and doing original investigations,
[13:45.960 --> 13:51.000]  but also breaking a lot of exclusive information with newsmakers like Roger Stone on a daily
[13:51.000 --> 13:52.000]  basis.
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.640]  Huge developments with Dr. Corsi yesterday of his investigation into the, into the Cruz
[13:57.640 --> 14:04.800]  campaign, actually running the takeover of Eagle Forum and mugging a 92-year-old woman,
[14:04.800 --> 14:10.400]  Phyllis Schlafly, an article going up on infowars.com about that interview as well, Phyllis Schlafly,
[14:10.400 --> 14:14.640]  my board plotted to fire me over Trump, we have that interview with him as well, that's
[14:14.640 --> 14:15.640]  up on infowars.com.
[14:15.640 --> 14:24.600]  But before I get into all the latest election news, the theft of the election, the canceling
[14:24.600 --> 14:34.680]  of the voters in primaries in many states now, before we get to this slow motion destruction
[14:34.680 --> 14:40.160]  of our electoral process, let's look at the background of what's happening, turmoil all
[14:40.160 --> 14:47.840]  over the world, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors being appointed to office, wars,
[14:47.840 --> 14:53.440]  economic meltdown in China, the World Bank coming out, the IMF saying they're going to
[14:53.440 --> 14:57.720]  go to zero interest rates.
[14:57.720 --> 15:04.360]  This is all part and parcel of the mega colossal bubble we're all sitting on top of.
[15:04.360 --> 15:07.960]  And there's a good chance Donald Trump may not get assassinated, may actually be able
[15:07.960 --> 15:13.840]  to defeat the cheaters, because the popular will, I'll give him about a 30% chance of
[15:13.840 --> 15:17.080]  not getting killed or actually getting an office, one or the other, and that's that's
[15:17.080 --> 15:22.000]  that's 30% chance that I'm not putting negative odds out there to scare people, Donald Trump
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.240]  is a hero because of his courage, I disagree with some of the things he says, but he's
[15:26.240 --> 15:32.400]  on a suicide mission, that's the headline of this segment, Donald Trump's on a suicide
[15:32.400 --> 15:37.160]  mission, a suicide mission doesn't mean you're going to die every time, but it means there's
[15:37.160 --> 15:44.760]  a good chance 50 50 or 30 70 I mean it means we're talking Russian roulette here.
[15:44.760 --> 15:48.560]  And you got to admire a man in the arena like that because I'm a man in the arena, not as
[15:48.560 --> 15:51.520]  much as Trump is, but I'm pretty close.
[15:51.520 --> 15:56.000]  And so's Roger Stout and others and it's a it's an exclusive club, Matt Drudge is in
[15:56.000 --> 16:05.920]  there deeper than I am in the arena, and I see a lot of other people buckling to it
[16:05.920 --> 16:13.120]  at major news sites and I see other news sites split on a world net daily a split, but the
[16:13.120 --> 16:18.680]  old wise man over there Corsi is not split, he knows Trump, he knows this is for real.
[16:18.680 --> 16:22.880]  Cruz is putting a lot of a lot of heat on people, Republican establishment is really
[16:22.880 --> 16:24.960]  dropping the hammer.
[16:24.960 --> 16:26.960]  He been threatened.
[16:26.960 --> 16:30.120]  This is a serious moment in America and for the world.
[16:30.120 --> 16:36.680]  Now, with that backdrop of Donald Trump on a suicide mission, and quite frankly a lot
[16:36.680 --> 16:41.960]  of other people on the mission with him, but he's right at the front, he's the general
[16:41.960 --> 16:47.320]  with the hat and the epaulets up there in front of these crowds of 30 40,000 people
[16:47.320 --> 16:49.640]  where they can infiltrate somebody.
[16:49.640 --> 16:57.720]  I mean, he is the big sitting duck, he is the man in the crosshairs.
[16:57.720 --> 17:01.920]  I'm just two or three rows back up here and I know how dangerous it is, because I'm just
[17:01.920 --> 17:07.080]  in the general firing line direction, and all these cowards rolling over to the system
[17:07.080 --> 17:16.080]  lying to themselves back in Ted Cruz back in casing.
[17:16.080 --> 17:23.760]  Just remember you had a chance to save the country if we lose this thing, just remember.
[17:23.760 --> 17:24.760]  Panic delete.
[17:24.760 --> 17:28.280]  Now, here's the backdrop, our story is up on drugsreport.com, it's the top story on
[17:28.280 --> 17:32.200]  the left hand side.

[27:56.440 --> 28:00.760]  people and we found out they were Democratic Party operatives and we've caught folks doing
[28:00.760 --> 28:05.960]  it to Trump I mean it's gone on a lot but I'm sitting here thinking how we're gonna

[28:27.080 --> 28:32.440]  then bring it to us but imagine the average leftist is in these organizations and they
[28:32.440 --> 28:36.320]  really believe all this and then they're sitting around in meetings about how to frame people
[28:36.320 --> 28:39.600]  and how to create racial division and stuff and they've heard me talk about it and they
[28:39.600 --> 28:44.120]  go Alex Jones is actually right and they flip right there over to the rebellion over to
[28:44.120 --> 28:48.840]  the alliance over to the defense of the Republic and they realize well we're on the wrong side

[42:46.040 --> 42:51.360]  Bank it's Federal Reserve heads saying we're on the edge of a total implosion it'll be
[42:51.360 --> 42:56.000]  worse than the Great Depression sell everything you've got I mean you've seen those headlines
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.600]  more fear mongering than I ever did five years ago when I was warning people now I don't
[43:00.600 --> 43:04.920]  really have to do that because we were unable to stop it we couldn't get the policies changed

[43:15.120 --> 43:21.040]  lava shooting up occasional gas ash starting to come out but they think it's going to explode

[43:29.600 --> 43:32.680]  know when it's going to blow I don't know which side of the mountains going to blow
[43:32.680 --> 43:36.240]  out I don't know which direction it's going to rain ash I don't know how big it's going
[43:36.240 --> 43:42.320]  to be but baby it's a biggin and it's like a you know cheesy Star Trek movie where they're
[43:42.320 --> 43:48.800]  on some unstable planet there's plastic boulders rolling down the hill and we're so the planets
[43:48.800 --> 43:53.760]  won't hold much longer you've got to beam out of there I mean I don't know what's going
[43:53.760 --> 44:00.520]  to happen but baby we're sitting on top a ton of TNT with lobotomized chimpanzees running
[44:00.520 --> 44:07.820]  around with flamethrowers and there's fuses sticking up everywhere and elites are digging
[44:07.820 --> 44:12.800]  in like it's the end of the world I don't know what's going to happen I just know they're
[44:12.800 --> 44:18.720]  stealing and robbing and banning speech and starting wars and stealing elections and just
[44:18.720 --> 44:25.320]  running around like psychos everywhere while they build armored fortresses and get helicopters
[44:25.320 --> 44:31.280]  worn warmed up with the crews on one hour standby and private jets are on one hour standbys
[44:31.280 --> 44:37.920]  all over the place what do they got planned maybe they just stolen so much the wicked
[44:37.920 --> 44:41.600]  flea would none pursue maybe things aren't that dangerous they've just stolen trillions
[44:41.600 --> 44:46.900]  gotten away with murder major government institutions and banks are running snuff film white slavery
[44:46.900 --> 44:52.840]  rings narcotics traffic slavery's been brought back all over the world this total insanity
[44:52.840 --> 44:56.920]  and they can't believe what they've gotten away with I don't know maybe it's not bad
[44:56.920 --> 45:05.680]  maybe maybe maybe that's the 5% hope that they are just paranoid themselves I don't know
[45:05.680 --> 45:11.360]  but panic elite buying bombproof luxury survival bunkers to escape civil unrest and disaster

[54:50.720 --> 54:59.680]  wars dot com and then it ties into this headline millionaires fleeing Chicago over fears of
[54:59.680 --> 55:05.320]  civil unrest from last week and that's in the Chicago Tribune but we wrote a boil down
[55:05.320 --> 55:09.920]  story showing other newspapers saying the same thing around the country and around the world
[55:09.920 --> 55:15.560]  just so you know it's not one little isolated incident that's why info wars dot com story
[55:15.560 --> 55:19.000]  is so much better than say a New York Times article or a Chicago Tribune because they'll

[55:40.480 --> 55:45.200]  buying bomb-proof luxury survival bunkers escape civil unrest disasters here it is
[55:45.200 --> 55:50.320]  I began to hear world economic forum meetings in Davos that there was some whisperings in
[55:50.320 --> 55:56.400]  the corridors about very wealthy people buying airstrips in New Zealand and preparing for
[55:56.400 --> 56:01.880]  all kinds of disaster scenarios so I got interested and started doing research and I found a guy
[56:01.880 --> 56:07.280]  Robert Vachino who is the CEO of a company called vivos and he builds these luxurious
[56:07.280 --> 56:14.000]  underground shelters they the one that I visited in Indiana is in a former Cold War communications
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.600]  facility and it's nuclear blast proof you go underground and it feels like you're in
[56:19.600 --> 56:25.360]  a very nice hotel I mean there's pillow top mattresses on the bunk beds and there's you
[56:25.360 --> 56:31.520]  know a luxury kitchen there's a there's a studio where you can watch movies on a big
[56:31.520 --> 56:37.240]  screen TV you know it's not the kind of hat hideout that you imagine and and this is for
[56:37.240 --> 56:41.760]  wealthy people who are concerned about various disaster scenarios but a common theme among
[56:41.760 --> 56:50.480]  them is a fear of civil unrest a fear of an uprising from the 99% the real fear is the
[56:50.480 --> 56:54.920]  breakdown of civilization you got seven and a half billion people it's a time bomb you
[56:54.920 --> 57:04.080]  think army ants can eat a whole forest in a matter of hours in Brazil as as as modern
[57:04.080 --> 57:12.040]  and as urban as the population is of the globe now you have a major meltdown it will be catastrophic
[57:12.040 --> 57:22.760]  beyond our imaginings because of the immorality the domestication the ignorance the stupidness
[57:22.760 --> 57:29.200]  of the average Bernie Sanders supporter the average Hillary supporter but also the average
[57:29.200 --> 57:35.880]  soft Republican I mean you go out and you look at the soft people and look I'm not
[57:35.880 --> 57:39.440]  bragging compared to really tough people I'm not that tough but you know I can I can
[57:39.440 --> 57:44.240]  deadlift 400 pounds you know six seven eight times more than that except my hands tear
[57:44.240 --> 57:54.000]  open I mean I can hike 30 miles with a pack on my back right now average person wouldn't
[57:54.000 --> 57:58.080]  even think about doing that I know how to get fresh water I know how to get fresh game
[57:58.080 --> 58:02.960]  I know and I've got horrible foods in medical gear because if there's a small chance this
[58:02.960 --> 58:06.720]  could happen I've got to be ready folks there's a guaranteed chance we're going to have a meltdown
[58:06.720 --> 58:10.760]  but it's going to be controlled and they're going to roll out the FEMA camps and the food
[58:10.760 --> 58:15.760]  and the socialism and the re-engineering of society it's such a diabolical sickening
[58:15.760 --> 58:21.760]  clowered and piven plan writ large across the world what's that plan one of many it's
[58:21.760 --> 58:26.720]  public create such a welfare state of domesticated people things collapse and then use that to
[58:26.720 --> 58:33.200]  bring in a new order of control with the servile slaves that never knew what it was like to
[58:33.200 --> 58:37.760]  go out and shoot a squirrel or go out and pick wild vegetables and feed yourself they folks
[58:37.760 --> 58:43.400]  they can't tie their shoelaces trendies are into not having shoelaces they're into being
[58:43.400 --> 58:50.400]  jellyfish they're into being fools it's their religion is to be filth I guess first of all

[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:33.440]  Tribune the New York Times infowars.com has a story boiling it down that's on drudgereport.com
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.360]  right now they've upped the game now saying that Trump's a sore loser that he doesn't
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:43.360]  like they've canceled primaries in multiple states or that they're taking delegates that
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.120]  were pledged to him and he won the popular vote so winning the popular vote or having
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:53.920]  the vote canceled where you're ahead in polls is now sore losing now I'm not the one saying
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.560]  that they're the one saying it but but but Cruz will never mention when he's on Glenn
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:01.440]  Beck what he's doing I played the clips yesterday there's new ones today but I want to start
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.520]  one of your calls right now we got Cindy, Paul, Chris, Mark, Terry and many others let's
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.960]  go ahead and go to Cindy and Pennsylvania thanks for holding.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:19.040]  Hello Alex I'd like to make a few short points sure I think Ted Cruz has been a sleeper cell
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:25.840]  for years and I don't know if you saw that video where he wants to rule the world yes
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:30.080]  that explains it right there they probably grabbed him in college because he has such
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:37.680]  a high IQ that they formed him then and secondly I would like to see you come out with some
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:44.600]  t-shirts maybe St. Michael the patron saint of soldiers police and all warriors that's
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:50.480]  how we could identify each other with St. Michael as our patron saint I gave out key
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:55.360]  chains to all the local police around here so they knew I was in unity with them at Christmas
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.360]  time.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.440]  Well and again I want to be clear that the Globals are trying to corrupt the police there's
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:03.240]  a lot of problems the Justice Department is very evil but absolutely we do not want a
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:08.320]  civil war and the patriots and libertarians of this country want to be identified with
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.680]  the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the rule of law, family, private property, right
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:16.960]  to self-defense and not randomly shooting cops in the back of the head so the police
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.400]  know that we're on the side of honorable men and women in uniform when they try to come
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.960]  for the Patriots though then it's a different story and that's why we don't want to have
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:28.560]  a fight up front with them we want to give them a chance to do the right thing and since
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:32.920]  I've put this all a branch out the last six, seven years they have really taken to it because
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.200]  they understand what's happening and they want to save the country as well they use
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.520]  bad examples on purpose to create a civil war in this country and I totally agree with
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:44.040]  you we need to reach out to police and military now.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:50.120]  Right and have you heard of Dennis Michael Lynch?
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.760]  Michael Lynch it rings a bell who's he?
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:59.600]  Dennis Michael Lynch he has a show on Newsmax it's called Unfiltered he's a great Patriot
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.360]  I would love to see him on your show.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.720]  Let's get him on I love a lot of those Newsmax shows they get a lot of big guests as well
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.240]  a great idea people say why do you have people on from other outfits like World Net Daily
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:15.120]  or Newsmax I don't care it's not about I'm the big show and I you know it's only our
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:21.320]  people on I promote everybody even you know news outlets that are usually disinformation
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.840]  when I see a story in the New York Times that I think is really accurate or thought provoking
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:29.280]  we link to it or if it's a lie we'll post it and have a note saying look at this complete
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.720]  garbage watch our video below exposing it but sometimes people see articles on my site
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.880]  we had an article up there the other day about Steve Watson about Trump saying he thinks
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.600]  we should waterboard ISIS because they're so evil and so corrupt that they don't deserve
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:47.520]  regular you know rules and then people wrote articles saying Jones's endorsing torture
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:53.280]  no we're not we wrote what Trump said everyone knows I'm against it I think he's wrong but
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:57.520]  I don't think he means bad when he's saying it like I get wanting to torture ISIS it
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:00.800]  just shouldn't be done because it lowers us to their level do you see what I'm saying
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:07.800]  this Cindy oh of course and I'm behind John a percent Alex I pray for you and your family
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:11.800]  every day ma'am I need it I need it I need it I did so much stuff going on I've been
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:16.000]  so blessed and so protected and I and I and I and I really need your prayers thank you
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.200]  so much got it that's a great idea you know even if you're not Catholic I personally am
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.160]  not Catholic but I'm a Christian you know the idea of saints it was in the original
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:32.280]  Bible even before you know Catholicism and you know I think it is good to venerate professions
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:37.480]  and art types and things you know through the saints and it's a good idea just to remind
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.960]  you like I personally keep saying I'm gonna do it I'm not a jewelry guy never have been
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.920]  like we're in a wedding ring but I do our watch occasionally but I think I'm gonna get
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:52.080]  a nice little silver cross or something just remind me of who's in charge plus in times
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.840]  like this is very comforting I'll be honest plus they want to ban it that's the real reason
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:01.040]  they want to ban the cross I'm gonna get one Joe Biggs here with info wars dot com text
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:06.600]  Eliza wants to be a breathalyzer for your cell phone article up by gizmoto distracted
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:11.400]  driving is a hazard up there with drinking and driving a solution proposed in a draft
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:17.040]  New York legislation would solve that using a roadside phone analyzer the bill provides
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:22.240]  for the field testing for use of mobile telephones and portable electronic devices while driving
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:26.320]  after an accident or collision after being involved in an accident a driver would have
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:32.000]  to submit their phone for roadside testing or face an automatic suspension of their license
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.680]  that testing would be done anonymously using a device that would only look at metadata
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:42.040]  hmm yeah sure buddy the actual content of a message picture or game would not be revealed
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:46.000]  yeah I don't believe that one seen as how the NSA and others are putting their fingers
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.240]  at everything a driver under suspicion of distracted driving will be under extreme pressure to unlock
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:56.120]  their phone to prove their innocence giving officers full access to everything on a handset

[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:18.640]  scientists and the answer is clear iodine is key is paramount and there's still so much
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:23.400]  new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it in our quest for the
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:29.000]  purest iodine we drill down more than 7000 feet to gather these purple blue crystals
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.360]  to extract the ultra pure iodine on top of that we also screen our iodine for radiation
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:39.520]  before bottling it is the purest cleanest strongest out there quite frankly I'm flattered
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:44.520]  that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine that major brands and major companies
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:48.080]  have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:53.920]  come up with anything even close to what we have it is exclusive to info wars life dot

[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:24.720]  the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:30.120]  Donald needs to understand he's not Michael Corleone I understand that Donald has had
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:37.360]  some very shady business deals with people that are currently in prison mobsters but
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:46.560]  the presidency should not be like Osanostra and it is wrong for a presidential candidate
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:54.120]  or for his henchmen you know what's crazy about that is there the ones canceling elections
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:09:00.200]  they're the ones doing dirty tricks against Ben Carson they're the ones doing all this
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:04.440]  and then they just turn around in another clip I have and say that Donald Trump is a
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:12.160]  sore loser he's Donald the loser and I've won the last 11 states which isn't even true
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:17.520]  and he's just mad I'm winning the popular vote this is democracy when they're canceling
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.760]  elections and having party bosses give him all the delegates like Colorado and Hillary's
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:28.200]  doing that all over the place to Bernie Sanders to this has never been done like this you can
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:37.080]  have a contested deal at the convention that's when it's close but nothing like this and
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:41.480]  then of course you have Ted Cruz right here when he was 18 years old about what he aspired
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:57.760]  to do when he grew up here at us well my aspiration is to oh I don't know being a teen tit film
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:03.640]  like that guy who played Horatio you know he was in Malbo Bikini Beach shop well other
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:18.240]  than that take over the world world domination rule everything and here's his dad his dad
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:33.240]  thought about this rule domination so there you go and then you got Donald Trump
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:38.280]  who has some issues I don't agree with him on surveillance things and torture and stuff
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:42.080]  like that I know friend of ices but you can't stoop to their level and it gives you bad
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:48.360]  intelligence obviously but have we ever seen a moment in world politics where the entire
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:53.440]  globe the Vatican the communist Chinese the British government the German government the
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:57.160]  Saudi Arabian government the Mexican government everybody says you can't have Donald Trump
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:01.360]  and they take stuff he says it's common sense like we can't have an open border and pay
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.080]  for everybody have their kids here free nobody else does that or if we're not checking the
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:11.760]  Muslims coming in stop it all till we start checking people again and then they just run
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:15.640]  around screaming racist racist racist and then have anti-Trump people go all over the
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:23.360]  country universities you name it and physically attack anyone who tries to have a Trump rally
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:31.280]  I want to go to Chad I want to go to Paul and Mark and Terry and Chris and others let's
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:38.760]  go ahead and go to Paul in Georgia you're on the air welcome hi listen they have violated
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:45.160]  the rule law they have broken the social contract these guys the criminal class have no boundaries
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:49.440]  they don't believe in the nation state they think we're rugged we're regularly captured
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:54.240]  and they're going to go for broke because they are having a gut check moment and the
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:12:00.440]  election this primary will be a good post to see where we're at as far as how many people
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:04.560]  are willing to take action I agree it's a gauge I want you to continue but for listeners
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:10.440]  is just tuned in this is the year we see the veneer the curtain pulled back this is when
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:16.160]  we find out what's in the closet and if we're already under TPP and in a you and EU global
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:20.080]  governments being announced by the pope and they're like look we took you over yeah we're
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:23.400]  going to appoint your presidents now we're already doing it in Europe I said that four
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.520]  or five years ago they started appointing Goldman Sachs heads to run all these major
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:32.400]  countries they would appoint them as president and order the parliaments to appoint them not
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:37.240]  have elections or they quote wouldn't give them more loans of fiat made up money when
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:42.640]  they got away with that in Europe they said look Americans are just as fat dumb and mindless
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:48.080]  as them we're going to do it here and now you see both parties doing it as a test in
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.840]  front of everyone I totally agree with you go ahead if we have guns that's the bottom
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:57.880]  line but the mind controlled minions are a lesser class of people than the educated
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:02.880]  folks that listen to your show and listen to alternative media who aren't as brainwashed
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:08.120]  I think we have an advantage here I think that they are going to hide and run when it
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:12.520]  comes down to it all I think we're winning and I'm going to agree with you I mean Europe
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:17.800]  the globalists are getting thrown out of England out of the UK the Brexit Spain is totally
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:23.000]  upset they're having some sessions a Catalonia voted like eighty some percent to leave that's
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.040]  their most productive area you've got the same thing in Italy the listen you're right
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:34.360]  the world is waking up it'll take time but once the public knows they're under a multinational
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:39.120]  oligarchy it's over the globalist always wanted to build a corporate world government
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.200]  have regional systems but still have puppet leaders in but we now know their puppets and
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:49.760]  the moment we stop looking at the puppet and look above the puppet to the actual puppeteers
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:58.120]  it's game over for the new world order it collar drop he made his points that was a
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:02.840]  powerful caller and by the way I'm not up here cheerleading saying we're in a good position
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:08.720]  we're doing great we're in a bad position the globalists have taken over but now people
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:12.080]  are starting to wake up the pendulum swinging back the other way the establishment is trying
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:17.680]  to suppress everybody and dominate us and break our will and it's not working so we
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:21.840]  are in a better position and as time goes on it just gets better the problem is they
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:30.200]  could effectively bring in hardcore hot tyrannies not not creeping tyrannies not stealth tyrannies
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:36.120]  not velvet glove tyrannies but the real thing and they're miscalculating histories clear
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:40.720]  their own analysts tell them don't do it even the CIA analyst buck sexton who was calling
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:45.960]  me a conspiracy theorist on CNN saying don't listen Alex Jones had to go on and say you
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:51.880]  steal the election from Trump it's gonna be like a nuclear bomb going off don't do it
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:56.440]  and I happen to know that the CIA and the rest of people that are plenty corrupt at
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:01.760]  the top are telling the Republicans and Democrats man you need to stop we need to indict Hillary
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:06.120]  we need people to be punished we need to at least look like we're not totally evil we're
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:12.840]  losing our soft power we're losing the info war stop it and the lobbyist and the bankers
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:19.040]  and the George Soros says Soros says listen I was rounding people up in 1944 for the Nazis
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:24.240]  and I'll get away with it this time too you sit out and you shut up full steam ahead and
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:28.000]  he's like move missiles into Russia let's have a war he's in the news saying let's have a
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.640]  war with Russia we got former generals on Fox News saying we start killing Russians and
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:39.960]  having body bags there are a lot of crazy people in the power structure there's a lot
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:46.440]  that aren't crazy by the way but you got a bunch of them that are crazy they're crazy
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:54.600]  all right it's been holding the longest we're gonna go to Mark then Terry then Chad then
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:16:00.920]  Nelson and others let's go to Mark you're on the air from California former state now
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:07.640]  under the control of the North American Union go ahead yeah I'm thankful you have on the
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:14.320]  Jerome Corsi and Roger Stone and are telling us about the how they're stealing the election
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.720]  and probably of all your listeners I tell more people in an average year one-on-one
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:26.320]  about the show because it is the best but I think we have to remember also that the
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:34.840]  times of the Gentiles ended in 1996 and that is when the time of the end began Alex Jesus
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:41.640]  is coming back soon and I would swear to God on a holy Bible on a holy Bible that a month
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:49.600]  before 9 11 happened you can I understood it would be then based on the prophecy in Daniel
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:55.160]  chapter 9 that gives this you know 77 I agree when it talks about the rich men seeing the
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:17:02.440]  big city collapse Babylon and all that look I agree we're in biblical in time type scenarios
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:06.520]  I don't know because there's many antichrist and many models the devil tries to build
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:11.240]  the same system over and over again towards what he thinks is perfected but undoubtedly
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:17.920]  with the microchips to mine cell and they're gonna now are announcing DNA chip where they
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:22.960]  take your blood put it in the system to be able to get prescriptions that's all doctors
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:29.880]  and all nurses and all pharmacy people pharmacists are being told it's starting next year I cover
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:35.440]  that a few weeks ago with all the casual society stuff happening with the GMO with the with
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:43.640]  the world government I mean this is all biblical and it is a very very scary yeah but what
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.040]  I'm saying Alex is you know I know he said you don't know the day an hour but on the
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:52.600]  other hand he said you know he'd raised the dead on the last day and the last day of
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:59.000]  the Sabbath year is coming up as far as I can tell around December 1st so you know I've
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.120]  done a lot of study on on this and even though you can't calculate the day an hour of his
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:09.960]  return you actually can calculate the precise hour of the so-called I'll say this I sure
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:13.240]  hope you're right I sure wish this is all stop right now and God come down here and
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:18.720]  fix this and just show all these evil people you know how things really work but look all
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:23.160]  I know is the elite are running around just like them just like revelation says hiding
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:27.600]  in the mountains hiding in the caves you know hiding in their underground fortresses they're
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:36.080]  all stirring and hiding right now so what does that sound like to you well I you know
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:42.560]  I know that Jesus is going to win in the end you know and he's already I believe starting
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:49.480]  to move in a in a way because we are at the time of the end and I know that if we trust
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:56.040]  in Christ alone that we have nothing to fear absolutely and that's why I really do not
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:01.320]  fear the New World Order because I have a personal relationship with Christ and God and I know
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:07.760]  God's real and I it's humbling to you know be able to feel God's presence and I'm very
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:12.120]  sad for people that don't have that connection to God and it doesn't mean again that I'm
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:16.960]  on a high horse folks or I've got all the answers I know how wicked my flesh is but
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:21.120]  I do have a relationship with God I appreciate your call mark a very very good point she

[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.760]  six vial I mean there are so many clues like that it's written that last color he's absolutely
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:14.760]  correct um and at the shepherd's chapel we don't give you dates we go by like say the parable of
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:19.000]  this big tree which that's up the last generation you know 1948 sure I hear you I'm gonna jump to
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.520]  others because you call a few weeks go and basically the same thing but I hear what you're
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:27.480]  saying it's it's look they're coming out with world government microchips to buy and sell
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:33.160]  they're saying no cash will be allowed forced medical control a world government a one world
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:40.600]  religion 10 regions with three mega regions over them either the bible's real or they're using it as
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:46.600]  a template of control like oh this is good science fiction let's do this and I'm not doubting the
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:54.120]  bible myself I'm just saying whether it's real or not it's being manifest like Jules Verne's 150
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:27:00.840]  years ago wrote about spaceships to the moon now it's happened you know 70 80 years after he wrote
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:09.960]  about it humans are able to build what we imagine and it's happening look let's say you're an atheist
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:14.840]  you should be against the casual society because it tracks you it traces you it controls you it runs
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:22.600]  your life but you'll say oh I'm all for it because you know those dumb Christians are scared of it
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:29.160]  you'll just adopt whatever because you think it's cool and I'm not saying all atheists are like that
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:36.040]  but I do see that happening driverless cars cell phones all of it with backdoors to control your
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:41.800]  life to game the system to run your life and now the feds came out two days ago and said yeah we

[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:51.720]  I'd talk about that 15 years ago people laughed at me they're already starting federal test cases
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:59.400]  to tax you by the mile it's here and it's taking control of our lives away from us

[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:14.040]  a dictatorship of a technological elite and I think you're so dumb they'll go we're not for

[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:17.640]  as well and again will this film save the world to save the country no but they want to shut down
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:24.760]  our free speech and our information because together it will defeat the globalist congress has a
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:29.880]  nine percent approval rating uh the establishment is in trouble they're having to openly steal the
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:34.600]  election from bernie sanders and donald trump you may not like either one of them i hate sanders
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:39.160]  have some problems with trump but the establishment scared because they're not controlled by them so
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:43.880]  they're having to be very naked now about their theft and somebody who's been a veteran and also
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:49.480]  of course worked many years in ron paul's offices and then helped found a great organization that
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:53.640]  so many of you know that's been demonized because it tries to get the military and police to be
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:59.400]  educated and to reaffirm their oath to be oath keepers and not be part of a martial law takeover
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:03.640]  now when roads started getting involved in this many years ago there was a lot of eye rolling
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:08.600]  there isn't eye rolling at oathkeepers dot org right now because it's out in the open
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:14.840]  in us mbc wants the tea party arrested they want the christian church is shut down they want
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:20.280]  the government to take our freedoms they they they want to indict joel gilbert because he put
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:24.760]  a film out about obama and they say that's violation of election rules they they arrested
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:31.160]  denisha susan there's political persecution going on with it with the anti-t party people
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:36.760]  going around slapping folks beating them up attacking trump supporters all over the country
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:41.960]  this is the new safe space and steward rhodes founder of oath keepers joins us to talk about
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:47.960]  the film but also where he sees the state of the world right now a steward great to have
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:53.400]  you joining us via skype likewise thank you alex well go ahead we've got about 20 30 minutes here
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:58.280]  and i got a lot to say where should we start well what you just said is accurate the mask is
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:03.080]  starting to come off it's very clear now the american people i mean us ron paulers saw it
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:09.240]  in 2008 and 2012 the corruption inside the gop and it's the same way inside the democratic party
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:13.400]  but now everyone's starting to see it mainstream rank and file republicans
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:18.040]  who support trumpers are starting to see it themselves look at colorado it's very blatant
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:23.000]  it wouldn't have been allowed to vote so i think it's good as you said the the elites are are
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:28.840]  back against the wall they're trying to um corral the vote and corral the system as they
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:33.000]  always have been doing but now they have to do it much more openly and we said about the college
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.480]  campuses is the same thing i could see it when i was a student at law school when i was a student
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:42.680]  before that at unlv the kind of political correctness on the campus it's now right in your face it's
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:47.240]  right there with the the comma stars trying to enforce it by force which is one of the reasons
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:52.600]  why we're going to be on college campuses this year we're starting student chapters on college
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:59.480]  campuses across the country for that very reason anybody can go to google and type in chinese youth
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:05.480]  brigades communist chinese red guard and see them beating fellow students brains out with
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:11.400]  with aluminum chairs and burning them at the stake millions were killed by the youth brigade
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:17.160]  and when i'm here in austin and abortion clinic or we're at a university they identify as Maoist
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:22.520]  to a person and they come and say when we're taking over we're going to kill you soon we have it on
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:28.520]  video and and then they say it's our time and suddenly red flags are everywhere uh i guess this
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:33.800]  was breeding under the surface what do you make of that well they're just finally showing the true
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:40.120]  colors i saw it like i said at yo law school they're proud uh maoist proud um leninus there
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:44.600]  and so now they're starting to take the mask off and show what they really are but this is not china
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:50.120]  this is not russia so they're going to be seeing us so we'll be there too um veterans in this country
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:55.480]  patriotic americans are not going to let them take over the college campuses and use violence
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:59.880]  and force as they already have tried to do it's not going to happen look at the bikers who responded
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:05.320]  to the uh vons of the trump rallies by saying they're going to go there and protect free speech i mean
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:09.880]  like you i have a lot of problems with trump i just agree with him a lot of things but the point is
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:13.720]  is that you can't shut down free speech in this country once you shut down free speech that it's
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:19.160]  time to fight i know you've got a lot of points articles that are powerful videos every day at
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:22.920]  healthkeepers.org and i kind of like to get a report about the state of the military and the police
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:27.160]  nobody has more contact with them from a constitutional perspective than probably somebody like you
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:32.120]  i have a lot of contact as well they are on fire right now waking up and we know they really said no
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:36.120]  during katrina gun confiscation the media lied and said they went ahead with it uh but you know
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:39.800]  that's just an example of what's been happening that we're not told about and i want to give you
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:46.520]  the film obviously here with you as well today but looking at their attempts to ban free speech on
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:52.200]  colleges yeah i think it shows their weakness and their attempt to try to bully us that they brought
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:59.240]  out earlier than they wanted to the fact is they're really total totalitarians well sure i mean
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:05.160]  they it's a mixture of hubris on their part and believing that they they have it all locked up
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:10.120]  and also their desperation i think so you know they want to sandwich through and then push through
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:14.280]  their agenda and they think the american people can be can be cowed with fear and it's just not
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:18.520]  the fact it's just not going to happen they live in a bubble you know inside new york city
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:23.720]  that flies out here in montana or someplace out west this is not going to fly at all so they might
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:27.560]  be able to get away with it at columbia but it's not going to happen you know at any place that
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:32.600]  you have a veteran's returning from combat going to college they're going to get stomped that's
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:37.640]  what's going to happen to them so in fact i know a lot of veterans the first time they see some
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:43.640]  you know radical leftist trampling on a flag or burning a flag they're going to kick their ass
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:47.720]  and i know you can say well it's free speech but the veteran doesn't care about that
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:53.080]  and to hit in his mind it's not free speech that's not protected speech it's uh incitement to violence
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:58.040]  so he's going to he's going to go ahead and use it well especially because they've been attacking
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:02.120]  women and children and others i notice these communists always attack people in wheelchairs
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:06.360]  and stuff they don't really do it in areas where there's men or women that'll stand up around
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:12.280]  what is the sense right now of the military and police contacts uh that oathkeepers is talking to
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:21.960]  that they really have no sympathy for whether it's a Black Lives Matter protester or a radical
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:26.680]  burning supporter you know anti-trump person we're just tired of them being in our face
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:31.160]  colonists racist because we disagree with their with their political agenda and i think the rank
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:35.880]  and file military and police have the same feeling they're sick of it and so they have no sympathy
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:40.520]  for them so we have to guard against of course guard against our side trampling free speech
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:45.560]  and crossing the line but when someone gets in your face and wants to use violence i got one
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:50.520]  that one uh you know commissar who was screaming and screeching for muscles like you know bring
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:55.560]  some muscle over here i need muscle people like that we have no sympathy for so when she gets what's
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:43:01.000]  coming to her and her and those like her well well exactly a bunch of people run up to attack you
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.440]  because you're at the college you're a member of the college you're at the park they say it's all
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:08.200]  there is they try to physically assault you i mean it's time to you know to defend yourself
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:12.760]  yeah absolutely and when they get when when someone does defend themselves and they get
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:16.920]  stopped of course they'll they'll screech and call them racists and fascists and brown shirts
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:21.560]  but they brought it on themselves and so i just have no sympathy for them you know um now if they're
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:26.120]  going to go out and and uh use free speech then that's fine we'll defend the right to free speech
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:30.040]  too but as soon as they want to cross the line of violence as well we're their huckleberries that's
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:36.680]  okay we can do that too start what is your sense with your contacts in government out
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:41.720]  on where this country is going currently as you call it the battle space here in the republic but
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:46.680]  also what's happening in europe uh what obama is doing the opening the borders outside of law
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:52.040]  flaunting everything i mean is this the death of america or is this the death throes of the
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:57.640]  establishment trying to wound the nation however they can on their way out where do you think we
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:04.040]  are currently well i think you've said so yourself it's a two-way window um in past conversations
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:10.040]  we've had over the years chaos they want to use creative chaos to create their future we understand
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:15.640]  that they're doing a full a full spectrum fourth generation warfare assault on this country just
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:20.760]  as they're doing on on europe it's an assault on western civilization the wide open borders in europe
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:26.280]  the the obvious you know tet two as matt bracken calls it i think he's right they're they're intentionally
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:30.920]  leaving the borders open in europe bringing in mass refugees among them are going to be jihadist
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:36.920]  who are setting up a future ted offensive ted style offensive in europe and the same things being
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:42.360]  done to this country so if we just sit back they'll win because they'll cause the chaos that they'll
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:47.480]  use as creative destruction now if we're ready to push through our agenda which is liberty during
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:52.120]  that time of chaos then we will win that's why it's incredibly important for us to make sure that
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:57.000]  we get together with fellow veterans and fellow constitutionalists in our communities and form
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.720]  up those we we call them sub community preparedness teams um however you want to call them civil
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:07.480]  defense units whatever make sure that you have the ability inside your local community to preserve
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:13.080]  liberty life liberty and property when the time comes and fight in the street against their their
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:17.960]  their fourth generation warfare agents which are going to be the jihadist and the cartels
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:22.280]  and the gangs and these radical black lives matter people and and the you know the black
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:26.040]  anarchists black flag anarchists it's all the same thing they're all they're all this force
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:30.520]  multipliers and proxies just as we saw during the cold war with communism so it's the same
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:35.720]  it's the same agenda we have to make sure that we provide the liberty version the liberty outcome
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:40.280]  instead of people going from the frying pan into the fire of thinking the only way to start the
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:44.520]  cotton right just as george washington ended up winning the propaganda war because his troops
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:48.840]  had much higher standards than the redcoats we have to be absolutely above reproach what do we
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:52.440]  do about things we have a mole inside the democrats i'm just going to leave at their high level
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:57.640]  they are getting info wars t-shirts when i guys go to new york tomorrow and to portland this weekend
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:02.520]  to come dress as info warriors to commit crimes i guess we just identify them videotape it and
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:06.120]  have their false flag blow up in their face and what else we do stir it to that type of fourth
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:11.560]  generation false flag that's all you can do and it has to be done on both sides because both the
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:16.760]  hillary clinton and you can look at cruiser or the other gop anointed they're both you know
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:20.600]  pre-selected and we all know this this is what's becoming very clear to the to the rest of american
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:25.880]  people now is that the gop and the democrat party one and the same and they pre-select your false
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:30.600]  choice um so that's what we're seeing now so i think it's good to see what's happening to the
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:35.880]  trump supporters and to the bernie supporters as you as you said i think bernie standard is at
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:40.200]  least an honest communist he's an outright communist but you're starting to see that the the
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:45.480]  manipulation of the system is becoming much more apparent to the american people that is good so the
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:50.040]  more we can make it makes that clear to everybody whether they're a democrat or a public and the
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:58.200]  better you were mentioning uh earlier the jihadis i mean europe advertisers the former head of the
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:03.480]  uu is the head of the migrant policy uh peter southerland says we need to take down europe in
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:09.080]  public statements and and you know in its cultural unity they they they destabilize the middle east
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:15.560]  put the al-qaeda jihadists and isis in use syria as a conduit into turkey turkey creates a corridor
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:20.200]  brings them into eastern western europe they advertise 80 percent of military age men they're
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:25.080]  getting in sleeper cell positions they're letting them in here not checking their ids this is all
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:33.800]  on record preparing obviously a secret super assault uh or what you said a jihadist uh western
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:38.680]  tet offensive for folks that don't know military doctrine explain to them what a sleeper cell is
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:45.160]  or what a tet offensive uh is basically a an example of well i encourage folks to go read matt
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:50.600]  bracken's really good piece he's a he's a retired navy seal called tet take two about what's happening
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:56.280]  in europe and all he's saying is is just like the north yemenese and the south yemenese vietcong did
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:01.640]  during the tet offensive i believe was 68 well they where they prepositioned their attack troops
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:06.760]  inside the cities like huay was a good example the infiltrated the infiltrated the city during
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:11.320]  the festival and they attacked during the tet festival which supposed to be a a time of truce
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:16.600]  and peace and they prepositioned thousands and thousands of cells ready for combat they
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:20.920]  catched weapons and they got ready ahead of time and as bracken points out that's exactly what's
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:25.240]  happening in europe right now you have ices telling us they're going to do this they've already got
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:29.640]  you know this recently came out and said they had at least 400 units so bracken's estimation is at
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:35.400]  least 100 000 islamic jihadists are already prepositioned trained by ices or or encouraged
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:39.640]  by the way you're not exaggerating you look at them they're military a lot of them have facebook
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:43.560]  where they admit they're military they've been brought in they've got commanders that are saudi
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:47.800]  and others this is really saudi trying to put sleeper cells here but you know the russians
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:53.160]  did during the cold war as an ultimate option during you know a larger war i can't believe our
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:58.840]  elites allowed this i think 100 000 european conservative steward go ahead absolutely right
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:04.760]  as bracken points out this is this is why you see kind of like a unholy alliance between the radical
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:09.640]  left and the islamicists you might think well why would why would a bunch of radical leftists who
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:14.120]  supposedly support gay rights and women's rights why would they support radical islamicists who put
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:18.280]  them all to death well the answer is that they have a common enemy the enemy is western civilization
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:21.960]  so they want to destroy western civilization so they'll get in bed with someone you would think
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:25.960]  that they'd be their their own personal enemy thinking they can control them down the road they
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:30.920]  can use them as a force multiplier as part of their creative destruction and then later control
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:34.360]  them of course they're wrong they'll wind up with their heads chopped off at the end if they
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:39.480]  prevail so we have to do to counter this is once again get back to the founder's ideal which is the
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:43.720]  people us as the militia so i encourage people to get together with their neighbors and form
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:47.720]  neighborhood watches get together with all the veterans in their community and form a how
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:51.800]  you know whatever we don't we want to call it a civil defense team a community defense team
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:56.520]  whatever it is get in in conjunction with your local law enforcement who are constitutional as a
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:01.000]  good sheriff and be his posse and get started let me stop you're right there i mean i'll be honest
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.400]  i thought we had more time because i know how hard it is for the global to roll stuff out they're so
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:09.800]  far behind i thought they were going to push it off instead they've accelerated it and about two
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:14.280]  three years ago you said look i'm giving up on politics partially i think everybody should focus
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:20.040]  on your sheriffs your counties your cities getting ready to have basically our own you know safe zones
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:24.600]  green zones for us because they're going to move against us and then we had intel about they're
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:27.800]  going to try to start race war they're going to try to start class war and i thought really the
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:32.920]  elites are really going to destabilize their own nest well you've been proven right it's now happening
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:37.400]  and i'm actually getting in a position now with trump to educate people supporting him
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:43.880]  but maybe only 30 40 percent of my energy now it really is look folks educate your local government
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:48.600]  get involved get people you can trust learn how to use a firearm get storeable food get medical
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:53.880]  supplies because it's now a probability we're going to have a long dark winter depression
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:58.920]  and they're going to use it to organize people in the big cities into these armies that come out
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:04.040]  in the rural areas and try to conscript people that aren't domesticated as their slaves basically
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:08.920]  this is communism and i really think we're going to face the darkest scenarios possible
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:13.960]  in america so people i mean really seriously you need to get ready for full occupation people
[01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:18.840]  coming to dig you out and uh full on war and by the way you can't capitulate and join them
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:23.480]  they're coming after everybody they want to fully gut the country so so let's talk about
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:27.480]  future battle space how we get ready for this because it's clear that they're planning a hot
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:32.680]  takeover absolutely i think i think what you have to do is tap into the reservoir of knowledge
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:36.920]  and training you already have in your local community especially among your veterans i
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:41.800]  encourage people to uh you know go beat down the doors your local vfw and anywhere else you
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:45.880]  can find veterans which is why we're going to be on the college campuses as well we want to be there
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:51.320]  to grab the returning afghan and iraq veterans and bring them into you know helping us to train
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:57.720]  you know the american people so start the neighborhood watch or recruit the veterans retired cops retired
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:02.280]  doctors and nurses all the talent you're going to need in your neighborhoods already there go
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:06.200]  find them and recruit recruit them and then the next stop after that is to work on your local
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:11.000]  sheriff electric good county sheriff and then then form a posse behind him but along the way if you
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:15.880]  can be a volunteer firefighter search and rescue emt go join that become part of your first responder
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:21.800]  community and make it stronger and get ready as you can other points because you always have a
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:25.080]  lot of points a lot of breaking news a lot of stories that are important and i ask the questions
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:30.120]  here i don't want to have you you know basically ask the questions by bringing out the topics what
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:35.800]  else is on your radar well a big one for us is the concern there's a recent book that put out
[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:41.560]  called day of wrath which is about a hypothetical potential mass terror attack in the united states
[01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:47.800]  of jihadi cells attacking schools we think this is extremely likely so we want people to be but in
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:53.320]  particular focused on the active shooter threat to your local schools and of course we know that the
[01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:58.280]  elites don't want us to protect our children they want them open to being slaughtered in a you know
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:03.160]  in a victim in a victim disarmament zone so i think the most important thing for us to do is find a
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:08.200]  way to counteract that so we encourage our veterans to go and talk to the local police department
[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:12.280]  and make sure they know how to communicate and coordinate because when the crap comes down like
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:16.120]  here where i live there's no swat team it's going to be up to us local veterans because the police
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:20.680]  will be overwhelmed and they realize this so we're already working working with them to coordinate
[01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:25.800]  so that if we do have a bezzan style attack on a school we veterans can go in and help them stop it
[01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:31.640]  as fast as possible and stop the killing absolutely and again the adl the sudden poverty loss center
[01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:35.880]  to a great extent correct me if i'm wrong they're starting to lose their hold on the police and
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:40.920]  military as they discover they're basically multinational disinformation operatives even
[01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:46.680]  the FBI says they don't use the southern primary law centers and adl's info anymore a lot of police
[01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:52.520]  departments are learning that they're giving them awards paying off police folks are realizing that
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:59.080]  these are basically outside institutions basically infiltration espionage organizations do you concur
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:03.320]  with that or what's your breakdown on the fact that those groups are now really getting discredited
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:08.440]  oh absolutely they're discrediting themselves because when they attack anybody who's conservative
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:13.080]  anyone's a constitutionalist anybody stands for traditional american values will be attacked
[01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:17.960]  as a racist and an extremist so your average beat cop is is a white mind they look at that and go
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:22.040]  wait a minute that's me you know so i think i think they've they've discredited themselves they
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:26.200]  don't need our help to do that so i don't really worry about them anymore i just go talk to the
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:31.320]  police and we ignore so they're probably a law center we we we talk to the cops and say we're
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:35.000]  the guys that guard the recruiting centers we're the guys around the rooftops in ferguson
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:39.080]  you know guarding against arsonists and we're here to back you up we have a new program called
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:43.800]  operation go forth which is named after that the uh texas police officer who was shot in the back of
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:47.320]  the head while getting gassed and all this is going to be is a national version of what our
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:51.880]  south carolina chapter has been doing ever since then every time i see a cop getting a donut or a
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:57.000]  coffee or we're getting gassed i'll stop and overwatch him in case he's attacked i can back him up
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.640]  so they see in our communities that we're the good guys that we're right there with them so long
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:05.960]  as the order of the constitution we're the best allies if they they violated of course we'll call
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:10.760]  them out but they understand that we are willing to put ourselves on the line mark potucka southern
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:15.080]  poverty law center is not going to be backing up any cop anytime soon he's not going to be there to
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:20.040]  stop its looters and rioters are staying with that cop against anybody else in the community
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:26.520]  who's using violence we will be i tell you i really think the globalist like george soros
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:29.960]  have miscalculated they've taken down a lot of arab countries they've taken down ukraine
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:35.560]  but we've just been warning people for too long back to the days of berry goldwater and now it's
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:40.280]  all coming true the liberty movement's credibility is only rising and you know i'm negative when i
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:45.720]  need to be steward but i have to be very positive about the work that so many people have done
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:52.120]  oath keepers and countless others it's very exciting to know that we're not going to be caught
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:57.560]  flatfooted here and now that people get it i'm seeing a maximum effort developed to really intensify
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:05.240]  preparation but also informational warfare locally with the truth and i really uh i mean
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:10.440]  now is the time to break the enemy's back politically it is my view absolutely that's
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:14.680]  why it's so important you know films like this one james jager's films and how tucker under
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:19.640]  sees film um revelation rise of global governments is important because it's coming at the perfect
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:24.200]  time a lot of americans paying attention to what's happening during this political season
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:28.280]  and they're seeing you know as you said right in their face you're seeing the manipulation
[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:33.080]  of both political parties like never before and you can't dismiss it as you know sour grapes of
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:37.640]  wrong powers this is not wrong powers anymore this is a much broader support base for trump
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:42.680]  that's seeing the exact same thing being done to them so it's the perfect time for us to say
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:47.480]  you know yes we told you so but hey look here's what we can do together whether whether we agreed
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:52.920]  in the past or not here's how we go forward from here here's a big download of information
[01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:57.160]  and get them up to speed and so a lot of a lot of delivery movement get kind of ticked off and
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:02.680]  they're you know they get uh you know jaded about being able to reach out to their fellow americans
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:06.920]  i think now is a great time absolutely and get outside your family sometimes your family won't
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:10.120]  listen to you have salesmen will tell you that don't try to sell a vacuum cleaner to your family
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:15.320]  sell it to the you know guy down the road uh i mean get out there and just speak out that's what
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:19.800]  it takes now's the time people are ready to listen let's play a clip where a little boy this last
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:25.080]  weekend in houston uh came out and this was his take up we're seeing the new film revelation

[02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:41.240]  for a long time we slowed it down but unlimited money and manipulation they pushing and now we're
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:47.320]  to the edge of the cliff here's a little secret though when we go over the edge they go over it
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:52.440]  with us and the fight begins steward rode's oathkeepers dot org is our guest i'm going to play
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:57.160]  a trailer to the new film revelation we have a special guest who was inside the muslim brotherhood
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:02.680]  the plo all of it he was one of them high level and for the last few decades he's become a christian
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:07.480]  has been exposing it kamal salim is going to be joining us he's in the film you want to stay with
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:12.760]  us for that and again i'm not here bashing muslim straight out i know a lot of folks have been
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:18.040]  overseas about a lot of muslim friends and college and high school but a large portion of islam is
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:22.360]  very radical wants to take over you call it orthodox islam you know that's what it started as an
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:28.840]  expansionist religion and now that's who's taking over all of islam it's who the globalists are
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:34.360]  backing it's who they're turning loose all over the world against our allies like egypt and now
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:39.480]  they're coming here and and that's really why i'm saying that we the next wave is not false
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:45.080]  flag folks it's our government letting them in to i guess bring in martial law after steward
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:49.160]  that's what i have trouble with how will the political elite let the sleeper cells in let
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:53.880]  them attack as they have been doing intensifying probing testing and then not have the political
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:59.960]  elite get in trouble instead merkel and haland and obama get more power out of the attacks
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:05.640]  they were the progenitors of well they've been doing that for decades that you know it's the it's
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:12.040]  the creative creative um destruction and you know musolini and hitler every dictator in
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:16.360]  rural history is as follow the same playbook and they get away with it because they control the media
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:21.000]  that's why it's important for guys like you and guys like me and the filmmakers that are out there
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.920]  now i mean this this is a chance for a a mainstream film distribution possibly um i've never seen a
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:32.040]  in a film this these topics discussed and there's a chance for us that you said they do well enough
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:37.000]  in texas it'll spread across the country and they got national distributors right now ready to put
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:41.400]  six million behind putting it in theaters nationwide if it does well in texas so it's important that's
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:46.600]  why absolutely absolutely right but you know even besides that the american people are now because
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:50.680]  of the internet because of free exchange of information they're starting to see this game
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:55.320]  and that's why they're taking the mask off they're doing it much more overtly i think a lot of them
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:59.160]  a lot of the elites believe well there's sure you see what we're doing which can't do anything about
[02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:04.120]  it that they in in the end their own hubris is allowing them to step out and say we don't care
[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:08.040]  if you see us here we don't have to hide it anymore it's right in your face what are you gonna do about
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:12.600]  it but as you said we're gonna go over the cliff with them and there's no way out but through so
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:18.120]  get ready folks get ready for the fight yeah that's absolutely right we got two minutes left stewart

[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:31.640]  sure and the neighborhood watches the most basic structure for doing that last question
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:35.560]  mexico has just failed state now do you think the u.s is headed towards something that bad
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:41.240]  um yes i think you might see a massive flood of refugees coming from mexico and central and
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:45.880]  south america when those economies implode one one one way for the elites to do it is to implode
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:51.720]  those economies first drive a massive exodus of refugees north of the border and then use that
[02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:56.040]  colonel schaffer says that's a real plan god bless your steward roge talk to you soon we'll
[02:04:56.040 --> 02:05:02.120]  be back with another special guest joe viggs here with info wars dot com textalizer wants to be a
[02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:08.040]  breathalyzer for your cell phone article up by gizmodo distracted driving is a hazard up there
[02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:13.560]  with drinking and driving a solution proposed in a draft new york legislation would solve that using
[02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:19.640]  a roadside phone analyzer the bill provides for the field testing for use of mobile telephones
[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:24.760]  and portable electronic devices while driving after an accident or collision after being involved
[02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:29.240]  in an accident a driver would have to submit their phone for roadside testing or face an
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:35.160]  automatic suspension of their license that testing would be done anonymously using a device that would
[02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:40.920]  only look at metadata hmm yeah sure buddy the actual content of a message picture or game would
[02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:45.480]  not be revealed yeah i don't believe that one seen as how the nsa and others are putting their
[02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:50.520]  fingers at everything a driver under suspicion of distracted driving will be under extreme pressure

[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:02.600]  world government now um i mean this is a very very scary time to be alive right now and we
[02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:10.200]  see western world allied uh with the most radical forms of islam overthrowing our allies in egypt
[02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:13.960]  overthrowing qaddafi wasn't a good guy but a good guy compared to isis and al qaeda
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:19.960]  taking that over for a failed state going into syria proxy wars with the russians i mean this is a
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:24.040]  very very dangerous time to be alive right now and this got to the point where charlie daniels is
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:32.360]  putting out songs behold a pale horse by the way that's as good as any of his music the devil
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:35.880]  went down to dorge he was looking for a soul to steal although he was in a bind as he was way
[02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:40.040]  behind i was looking to make a deal so we're gonna actually take that song with with the
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:46.120]  truck's permission oh we've gotten put a music video out to promote uh the uh the uh movie as well
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:52.040]  revelation the movie dot info it's going to be showing a few places in texas and then if it
[02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:57.320]  sells out there when it shows the first weekend or so then other other movie theaters will look at
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:01.240]  that and then start picking it up and it's up to you if you wanted to end up being on thousands
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:05.720]  of screens around the country i have produced films that have been on hundreds of screens
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:10.920]  and been seen by a hundred million people online and so i know how this works i don't have a financial
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:15.080]  stake in this i have a stake in it just wanting it to be successful under these but everything he has
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:19.720]  into it uh he's a guy who's making big tv commercials and tv shows and stuff and he put
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:24.600]  everything he had into making this film and there's other great films coming out as well that are
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:28.600]  very very exciting that we're gonna be promoting there's one that's uh you know the chuck norris's
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:35.720]  son and uh gary haven and others are putting out as well that i'm in as well but it's a fictional
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:40.040]  account of a world government takeover that's going to be airing on national cable uh after it
[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:46.200]  has it's a theater run so there's a lot of stuff going on out there where we're trying to counter
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:50.840]  the establishment and i just saw even a new york times article last week that christian films
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:57.320]  was also cns article are now some of the most successful out there and conservative and libertarian
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:05.320]  and anti-globalist films from a patriot perspective not left or right that shows quote the markets there
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:10.840]  well if if if these films become successful and then dominant that will take over from hollywood
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:16.360]  and they've lost so you can also vote with your dollars vote with your actions in a culture war
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:22.280]  now joining us at the bottom of the hour is a man i want to get on for a full hour in the near future
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:29.160]  kamal salim was born into a large sunni muslim family in the heart of the middle east and of
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:33.400]  course that's the group saudi arabia is pushing in to take over all over kamal was then recruited

[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:41.400]  we're facing a lot of folks are calling this a radical islamic sleeper cell tet offensive in
[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:47.720]  the making tell us your experience why you woke up and what you think's coming sir well what's
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:56.920]  going on on all that the isms are coming together like islamism socialism secularism fascism liberalism
[02:14:56.920 --> 02:15:03.560]  secularism all of them are part of the movement for the last days and they are united together
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:11.000]  for one world order to you know to make the whole world in pluralism one state one heart
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:17.000]  and therefore it will throw off the whole civilization into protection from different
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:22.120]  things and now they have to go under a world government in my experience i was born in be
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:27.640]  root level until a muslim sunday family my first person who radicalized me was my mom
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:34.200]  out of 14 brothers and sisters uh we were radicalized the boys uh my mother told me if you kill
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:39.400]  jews and christians uh your hand will light up before the throne of allah and a host of heaven
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:46.120]  will celebrate what you did from my from my childhood uh my heart was is to kill the deceivers
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:51.400]  which is the jews and christians from there i was recruited by the in the neighborhood mosque
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:58.760]  which is in the mosque in the united states of america it is like not like the church the mosque
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:05.400]  is an embassy to represent the islamic state it is a parliament to send the people of the mosque
[02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:11.400]  to engage the civilization they are in so therefore i was engaged i was recruited in the mosque
[02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:17.720]  by a special group called the muslim the muslim brotherhood came in 1928 after the fall of the
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:25.560]  ottoman empire in 1924 and our agenda was at that time when i was with them is to re-establish the
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:33.240]  islamic caliphate and islamic sharia and one world order under allah by establishing umma
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:39.160]  you know which is islamic state and this is what you see on the the isis flag the muslim brotherhood
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:44.840]  flag the saudi flag you see the swords you know like there's no peace without the sword unless
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:51.000]  the whole and everybody surrendered them i was trained in my my young age at seven years old
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:58.280]  that's when i was recruited and i was uh you know sent also to train with the plo with the whole
[02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:04.680]  group joined the plo and now we are training with the power of allah and the sword of allah both of
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:11.400]  them the gun and and the korean and therefore i want from there i was sent to israel at seven
[02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:15.960]  years old and eight years old and from there i was recruited by the saudi arabian government
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:21.640]  because i was raising funds from them for the cause and the call and when they found my heart
[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:28.200]  is for islam then they start utilizing me to the point they sent me to europe to engage europe in
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:35.800]  culture jihad and uh you see where europe is and that was in the uh in in in this 1970 and what's
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:43.400]  so heavy in those years and from there they sent me to united states of america i was commissioned
[02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:49.480]  because we could not bring the american people from the outside we have to inside america to
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:56.360]  take them down and so therefore my word that they sent me to do it was not like like the 911 people
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:18:04.200]  it was specifically uh you know still the methodology where america's we can work around
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:08.760]  and do everything that need to be done so you were kind of preparing the ground and in what
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:14.120]  information warfare to accept radical islam coming in say it again i'm sorry forgive me you were
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:21.720]  engaged in propaganda offensives yes absolutely you know uh my job was is to go to the jail system
[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:28.040]  and create a clash of culture recruit black african-american and therefore you know and
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:33.720]  convert them to islam and hope someday they will clash with the other race and so we create a great
[02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:38.920]  divide and it has been accomplished so you were trained by saudi arabia to create racial division
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:45.080]  in america uh aligned islam versus white christianity by the muslim brotherhood
[02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:49.640]  muslim saudi arabian and you know this is the islamic culture that we were trained
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:54.680]  wow with and for and our current you know administration has fulfilled that clash of
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:59.720]  culture but the other part is to invade the universities and the colleges to establish
[02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:05.320]  muslim student association muslim student union that's an arm of the muslim brotherhood
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:10.600]  and there in that place what happened is to buy the professors marry the american women obtain
[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:16.920]  the american citizenship so we can fight america by the sword of the life which is their constitution
[02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:22.760]  to take their head off with and then the other part is to engage politicians and buy politicians
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:28.120]  power by the god of mammon you know because uh we know that a lot of politician money is very
[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:34.120]  important to them and last but not least engage engage the poor neighborhood where they are uh
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:39.000]  they are weak and they're hungry and uh nobody want to touch them there we can thrive on there
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:45.960]  feed them and change their culture from within unbelievable military plan to take over kamal

[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:29.480]  i mean obama won't let for like the latest number was 700 something refugees came in that
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:35.560]  were almost all suny and he let in three christians and it's mainly christians being slaughtered and
[02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:40.040]  the un admits slaughter of christians doubled the last 10 years peaceful christians are being
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:45.560]  targeted everywhere for no reason because there's a spirit and i wanted to talk about his awakening
[02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:49.880]  why he woke up and said no has been fighting it for decades and then talk a few minutes about the
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:55.720]  film and then we've got the maker of the film set to be in studio but mr salim please continue
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:00.280]  with how you woke up and then other tidbits that you break down on the film that's going to be
[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:07.720]  showing this weekend in texas thank you alex uh the thing is in 1985 i had a severe correct uh
[02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:15.560]  that i cracked and i came to places and my left side was broken in many places and uh i in process
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:22.120]  i met a man and two other the physician all were christians and uh at the end of the day they took
[02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:27.240]  me home to recover because i was not the hospital's ready to let me go but they took me home to take
[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:32.760]  care of me there in their home i discovered something totally different that all the lie
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:38.360]  that i was told that we worship the same god i thought we really did but i found out jahovah
[02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:43.640]  god almighty and jesus and and and allah are not the same god they're two different gods
[02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:50.440]  and uh when i examined them i found out one god sold up the world the other god there's no love
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:56.120]  and mercy in his in his creation there's not his name is not love and he said if the whole world
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:26:02.760]  was worth anything then he destroyed it time and time again and the list goes on but uh from there
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:07.960]  uh watch the biggest bible that i've seen in my life that was how these christian people
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:12.920]  lived their life and how the husband treated his wife like a princess and not like a slave
[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:20.680]  versus how we treated our daughters and our wives and uh you know the whole family as women and from
[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:26.520]  there you know i've discovered something new it's called unconditional love that i never was familiar
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:30.920]  with in islam there's nothing uh there's no unconditional love everything's conditional
[02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:35.960]  so therefore today my favorite wife tomorrow if you dishonor me i have the right
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:41.880]  to take your head off to behead you and vice versa if you convert from uh from christ uh
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:48.280]  from muslim to christian then uh your father have to kill you you know all this is part of the
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:55.000]  islamic you know understanding of fundamentalism and therefore i i walk there and i start seeing
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:00.360]  two different god and i realized when i went to my home i fell on my knees and i called my god and
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:06.120]  he didn't answer but god of heaven and earth the true living god answered me and his name was not
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:13.400]  Allah his name was Yahweh and jesus appeared and i changed my direction he healed my body and he
[02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:18.920]  healed my heart and my mind this is a miracle that truly will take a radical to change from
[02:27:18.920 --> 02:27:24.760]  one extreme to the other extreme because now i know the truth and this truth gotta be sure
[02:27:25.320 --> 02:27:31.240]  with america because america is the final frontier and if america does not take stand this is the
[02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:37.000]  tipping point that america will never be the same again by this election from this time
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:41.640]  because it is really we're not dealing with a president here we we we we're dealing with
[02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:47.560]  a whole new world order that they want to change america and the first enemy in the united states
[02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:54.040]  america are the christians and the second part are the jews their agenda is for example is to take
[02:27:54.040 --> 02:28:01.240]  god and prayers out of education system reduce parental authority over children destroy the
[02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:07.960]  traditional christian family as a structure uh you know if sex is free then abortion should be
[02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:16.360]  legal and free uh make divorce uh applicable to everybody because so marriage has no value homosexuality
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:24.600]  be alternative lifestyle debase art and make it to run man use media to promote and change
[02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:28.440]  yes sir and mr sling we're almost out of time we're gonna have to make her the movie check under

[02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:20.440]  i got shot through the shoulder my first thought was damn that hurts even hollywood couldn't
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:29.080]  make up stuff like this the people of the world are waiting for americans to wake up we the people
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:40.040]  have the right to keep and bear arms the average citizen is photographed 300 times per day uh the
[02:36:40.040 --> 02:36:49.720]  fence ends right here beheadings uh beatings uh torturing uh burning people in barrels is indicative
[02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:54.440]  i think of their confidence now that it doesn't matter if this is open we'll have some power
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:59.640]  here that they can't take us down the biggest dumpling block to this plan is the united states of
[02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:06.840]  america why is that because we have a tradition of individual freedom and liberty we have to protect
[02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:14.040]  america and the american way of life first world government is only the beginning the cock is
[02:37:14.040 --> 02:37:22.120]  crowed friends denial will not stand once they have control they plan on absolutely dehumanizing

[02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:34.360]  for part of the next hour and there's charlie daniels i'm like cutting into him because the
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:40.440]  trailer actually continues on there uh at the end uh but again chuck undersea is right here
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:45.880]  in studio with us right now if you go to revelation the movie dot info i know on radio that sound
[02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:50.360]  like a powerful trailer you got to see it because that's really what you're a master of a cinematography
[02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:54.520]  that's what you did uh and then you retire came out of retirement um you've done some of the biggest
[02:37:54.520 --> 02:37:59.800]  cinematography out there for tv shows you know movies uh famous commercials but i tell you the
[02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:04.760]  cinematography on this is even better than a michael moore film which isn't that good or even a dinesh
[02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:10.840]  at susan this looks better than pbs uh so even made my fat butt look pretty good so great job sir
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:15.960]  thank you i was glad to be with tip of the spear oh no no you're the tip of the spear i tell you
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:19.160]  this film deserves to be in every theater in the country that's really up to viewers and
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:22.840]  listeners out there tell us about the film i'm going to go through some clips of it
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:29.320]  break down why it's so important well first of all we feel it's really critical that that uh
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:34.280]  everyone do their part and so many people everyone has a gift and it just happened to be that ours
[02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:39.240]  was filmmaking and uh an old preacher wants to tell me in east texas that uh be careful of
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:44.440]  what you ask god for because uh you may not like the answer and when we started this over five years
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:49.880]  ago uh we thought you know this will take a year and a half be a typical film but we got more and
[02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:55.240]  more access and sort of raised the money as we went and one thing led to another week we were
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:39:02.200]  contacted by the distributor for uh 2016 because it's extremely difficult virtually impossible
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:08.280]  to get a uh documentary in theaters and since they had such a success in 2016 they called us
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:13.960]  and said hey would you like to do this and we we had started this uh film as behold a pale horse
[02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:19.880]  and then they said well this has been out on dvd so you have to retitle and completely redo the
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:24.520]  film so we did we shot a lot of new stuff it's a very different film it was great before but now
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:33.640]  it's like beyond hbo well we feel that uh it's a perfect storm you know at this time because the
[02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:38.440]  election because it has nothing to do with the election but what it does have to do with is
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:42.840]  people are so and that's how providence works this would have been out two three years ago
[02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:47.560]  but now just waited till the right time we've often thought that because we were so frustrated
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:52.280]  two years ago we thought that we've been doing this for three years we need to get on with it you
[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:56.920]  know let's get it out and just one thing after another happened and providence has been involved
[02:39:56.920 --> 02:40:03.240]  at every level because again it's impossible to get a film like this in theaters and uh and we did
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:11.240]  it and the big issue is uh americans are trained like pablo's dogs to to pay attention to celebrity
[02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:16.680]  to pay attention to anything on tv and theaters and so all this information obviously you've
[02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:20.520]  been doing for years everything in the film you got to make it sensational that it's in theaters
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:25.000]  and it's that's what gives the mystique to make people pay attention that's the whole point the
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:31.720]  theater factor and uh and uh to to the patriot these issues are on the table but to those thousands
[02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:35.160]  of people that are still clueless still think they live oh yeah let's not forget that just because
[02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:40.120]  maybe 20 30 of the country knows what's going on most other people don't but they're ready to learn
[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:47.480]  yeah and and all those all the our point here with this is all the patrons who do know
[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:52.760]  know can be paul reveres to the what i call the gray people what you would have would have called it
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:57.800]  one time the the regular red blooded americans who know something's wrong we can't quite put
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:03.160]  their finger on it so if the if your audience the patriot community will go out and be paul reveres
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:07.160]  to use this as a tool because they're the tip of the spear right people say i'm the tip of no no
[02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:11.720]  this audience is really the muscle they're the ones on the ground well i hate to use the word
[02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:18.120]  collective but the collective voice of patriots can come together and make a difference and and
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:22.440]  like you were talking about earlier on the show that there is a time coming where where push is
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:25.960]  going to come to shove and people have to decide where they stand they're wanting to put joel
[02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:30.360]  gilbert in jail the the federal elections commission they arrested deniesa susan it would
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:35.800]  actually be tremendous if we did not have to endure what they are but we made the decision
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:41.000]  that we had to do what we had to do and and this is this is what we're doing well the good news is
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:45.960]  for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction newtonian physics people are upset
[02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:50.760]  and people in government i've never folks always say we're anti-government i'm anti unconstitutional
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:56.040]  government but on average the most awaited group i find now are police military but even bureaucrats
[02:41:56.040 --> 02:42:01.160]  now on the inside of this realize man we got a scary elite running things there's no not even law
[02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:07.320]  anymore it's just multinationals like the tpp telling us what to do you know if you really cut
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:13.800]  to the chase it astounds me having grown up in east x's and norman rockwell america that in fact
[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:21.160]  there are so many traders in our midst and you know if i had to be labeled it would be uh american
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:27.800]  nationalists uh i feel you're loyalist to america i yeah i was an army officer i swore
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:34.200]  notes the constitution i feel that uh america first and i think that the whole global thing is
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:43.160]  incomprehensible uh when you know as as christians we're charged with having empathy for anyone
[02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:49.160]  everyone and we are christian however uh as americans i don't feel that we owe the world a free ride
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:53.400]  and i think that well plus we're being sold out i mean i mean they sell globalism like we're trying
[02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:57.160]  to help people but really it's enslaving them that's all come out in their own documents
[02:42:57.160 --> 02:43:02.280]  the film itself so many clips from it some of these are exclusive today for folks that just tuned
[02:43:02.280 --> 02:43:05.320]  in but before we go through some of these clips and have you introduce them check under see the
[02:43:05.320 --> 02:43:10.120]  director of the new film revelation the movie dot info to get tickets and to find out the theaters in
[02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:16.520]  houston break down what the film grew into and who's in it because i tell you i've never seen
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:23.800]  like ted newgent with it look this good or him sound this good he always sounds great uh i mean
[02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:28.760]  it's just everybody in the film just really explodes off the screen what they say the footage
[02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:34.680]  you've got all the different things that happen i mean wow five years in the making well it was
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:40.040]  something of an unorthodox film project in that normal films especially long-form film
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:45.800]  you have a script you shoot the script you evolve it how it unfolds however in this case
[02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:51.640]  the only part the script is what charlie did and and he did a fantastic job as a consummate pro
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:56.200]  the problem is uh with people like general boykin or yourself or other people you don't
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:44:00.120]  sit them down and try and instruct them on what to say you know what you're saying you would need
[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:04.840]  to say so we had some 42 people that are rock stars in the patriot community in this film
[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:12.440]  and we how i structured it was pick various people who knew issues knew of issues jibrod griffon
[02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:19.720]  general boykin about communism marxism socialism where we're going you about the new world order
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:26.040]  you get the people that know their issues and then you you place them in areas so it complements
[02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:31.960]  the previous person and that's why it took eight months to edit uh but the point is it unfolded
[02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:36.840]  like that and i think providence has been in this at every term because it's an incomprehensible
[02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:42.760]  task to take 45 hours of footage and turn it into a meaningful hour and 40 minutes for the commercial
[02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:46.680]  film well the people looking for a weapon to fight the globalists this is it and we obviously need
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:50.920]  to get it to be sold out all this weekend and through next week at these theaters then other
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:54.920]  theaters will get it then we'll get on air and talk about those so you can see it in your area
[02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:59.800]  it's like a game and i've done this other films before and and our audience has and then it can
[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:03.960]  get on hundreds of screens if it gets on hundreds look if it does well on three or four screens it
[02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:08.760]  gets on dozens if it doesn't well on dozens it gets on hundreds if it gets on hundreds it does
[02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:13.960]  well it goes on thousands then it can change the country and as you know good as 2016 was this is
[02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:19.080]  this is light years ahead of that on how hardcore it is needs to be seen on hundreds of screens
[02:45:19.080 --> 02:45:24.040]  and bare minimum then dvd blu-ray people see it and then it ought to get you in you know
[02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:28.200]  touch like chuck norris for sure you already are or mike norris has the contacts to put it on cable
[02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:34.040]  tv or i'm sure your guys do get it on national tv for people to see because this is about waking
[02:45:34.040 --> 02:45:40.120]  the country up and again the mines are ready you plant in the springtime this is the springtime
[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:45.960]  of the mind opening up it's never been easier to get people to shift their thinking and just see
[02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:49.880]  what's happening because i don't tell people what to think i get them to take the blinders off
[02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:54.680]  and and i'm telling you the blinders are coming off and films like this are game changers chuck
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:46:00.840]  you know uh we've just this week the war for this has always been to get past the houston opening
[02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:06.280]  which takes frankly millions of dollars in advertising to get it in the national marketplace
[02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:12.600]  and so we now have just had in the last few days a tremendous opening and we have our national
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:17.320]  what they call pna funding in place and it will go national oh i didn't know that happened i thought
[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:20.840]  we were trying to go that's wonderful news that'll be two to three thousand theaters around the
[02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:26.120]  country and it still has to do well in houston to consummate that and that's why opening weekend
[02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:30.760]  on any film is critical uh this week tell folks the theaters that they've got to go it opens this
[02:46:30.760 --> 02:46:37.480]  weekend fridays saturday sunday in houston at the santicos uh chain theaters and one in richmond
[02:46:37.480 --> 02:46:41.640]  one in tom ball the one in richmond's called the palladium the one in tom ball is called the silver
[02:46:41.640 --> 02:46:47.640]  auto the reason the distributor chose who who also did 2016 chose to open in those two theaters
[02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:52.920]  is they were the biggest or the highest-grossing box office for 2016 because the conservative
[02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:58.760]  area in houston and so he opened us in this in that area and we already have sold out four or five
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:07.080]  screenings for this weekend we need to do more but we've we've advertised and uh bored and stolen
[02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:12.440]  all kinds of promotion and and it uh i think we should have a really good response however anyone
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:17.560]  in houston go this weekend because box office for the opening weekend is sure and then there's also
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:21.880]  moves to get it in art houses after that the film will have a long life and hopefully another film
[02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:27.480]  as you've got 45 hours of footage but this is so exciting now now the film just lays out in a
[02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:32.600]  continuum really what's happening it's extremely powerful great for experts great for newcomers
[02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:36.920]  i mean a serious weapon against the globalist uh let's play some of these clips uh let's play
[02:47:37.560 --> 02:47:42.920]  this clip with general boykin first a short clip talking about society moving towards marxism

[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:55.480]  it in china when our president's going to cuba standing below shea guavara he's going to argentina
[02:47:55.480 --> 02:48:00.920]  saying this is a great thing uh this is what the globalists want because they're exempt from it
[02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:05.560]  but get the slaves so here's the former head of special forces founder of delta force general
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:11.960]  boykin talking about uh what's happening with society whether we recognize it or not as americans

[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:05.880]  also the state of the world i mean it's not hard to wake people up when tyranny's getting so naked
[02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:10.920]  why do you think it's getting so out in the open i think it's spiritual warfare i think what we're
[02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:16.920]  seeing is the evolution of daniel and revelation i think that the agenda in europe the agenda with
[02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:23.160]  the open border here the sleeper cells is a trojan horse which will which will be the final climactic
[02:57:23.160 --> 02:57:31.000]  battle i think that uh and we're all charged as christians with with fighting tyranny so we
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:36.120]  have to make a choice everybody i talked to says it's pretty empowering to be off the grid but then
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:41.240]  that's but then they also go into an office and are on the grid but they separate it be of the world
[02:57:41.800 --> 02:57:46.120]  i mean be in the world but not of it you know don't be we're in babelon but we're not being part of
[02:57:46.120 --> 02:57:51.000]  babelon or trying not to is it empowering to be off the grid and then to also be able to separately
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:56.920]  fight the tyranny it's kind of a long story for us but a real simple con concept we we lived in la
[02:57:56.920 --> 02:58:04.120]  working in the film business for 20 years over 20 years and la is hectic to say the least and when

[02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:15.880]  see any neighbors no lights no wires no nothing and of course i was aware of the uh the whole smart
[02:58:15.880 --> 02:58:20.680]  meter thing and so we went off the grid totally we're not plugged in at all we have wood stoves for

[03:00:27.400 --> 03:00:32.760]  operation a bunch of breaking news look at this info wars dot com howard stern has come out and
[03:00:32.760 --> 03:00:36.920]  said we have a right to defend ourselves we believe in the second amendment you say well he's nasty
[03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:41.640]  and uses cuss words it's not about that if we can win over howard stern folks we're winning
[03:00:41.640 --> 03:00:46.280]  so when i tell you we're winning the statistics show it the numbers show it the problem is the
[03:00:46.280 --> 03:00:50.360]  top echelons have been hijacked so chuck where do you see the world going in the next few years
[03:00:50.360 --> 03:00:55.480]  where we're winning at the grassroots incrementally but the enemy knows that so they're racing to show
[03:00:55.480 --> 03:01:01.320]  it all up well again bringing back to the spiritual warfare no man knows the the hour and the day but
[03:01:01.320 --> 03:01:07.560]  i feel it's very very close and some of the people we've been dealing with we've had access to amazing
[03:01:07.560 --> 03:01:15.400]  people not only ones in the film but particularly a person in houston who is an elderly man who's
[03:01:15.400 --> 03:01:21.080]  been involved in all these issues for 60 years and he he feels very strongly that we uh we're
[03:01:21.080 --> 03:01:28.760]  going down a path that is is going to uh climax soon and i gotta hand it to all the patriots all
[03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:33.160]  the antinual order folks from the from 60 years ago berry goldwater all of them uh and you know
[03:01:33.160 --> 03:01:36.360]  the fellow that runs the tv station down there in houston i think we're talking about the same guy
[03:01:36.360 --> 03:01:41.880]  they were really right if it wasn't for them we'd be caught flatfooted i think that uh i i'm an
[03:01:41.880 --> 03:01:46.520]  optimist by nature and i think that there's always hope i think that you know in the old testament
[03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:55.800]  continually uh old israel was brought back to uh to faith and to a change and i think that's
[03:01:55.800 --> 03:02:01.160]  possible but i mean as charlie daniel says in the film uh we've all read the book we know it ends
[03:02:01.160 --> 03:02:07.560]  and we win so it may not be exactly the way we want but uh it's unfolding and it's happening fast
[03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:11.480]  anybody that sits around and says they're bored they must not have their eyes open this is
[03:02:12.040 --> 03:02:15.240]  quite frankly i don't like the bad stuff that's happening also good stuff's happening but
[03:02:15.240 --> 03:02:20.440]  it's pretty darn exciting i mean i'm not bored i'll tell you that i i've often heard you say uh
[03:02:20.440 --> 03:02:26.280]  what an amazing time to be alive and even though it's uh really frightening the things that are
[03:02:26.280 --> 03:02:31.400]  going on and it's it's it's going to be a ride i think that uh it is an amazing time to be alive
[03:02:31.400 --> 03:02:37.880]  and i think people that don't see this are missing the most important turning point in human history
[03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:43.400]  well i want to have you back for a full hour sometime uh just to talk about uh what it's
[03:02:43.400 --> 03:02:47.160]  like to live off the grid maybe send i don't want to get your privacy won't see where you live but
[03:02:47.160 --> 03:02:50.680]  maybe send a crew out and kind of show how it is to live off the grid because i want to get to

[03:02:55.880 --> 03:03:01.000]  chatter the dust you know the big city is not a healthy place to live uh we we've recently

[03:03:55.240 --> 03:04:01.080]  came from switzerland on my father's side uh in the 20s and he told me i'll never forget this story
[03:04:01.080 --> 03:04:05.560]  he told me that when the ship came into new york harbor and they were passing the statute of liberty
[03:04:05.560 --> 03:04:11.160]  1500 immigrants came to the side of the starboard side of the ship and the crew was nervous because
[03:04:11.160 --> 03:04:15.880]  it started tilting and they made them separate but when they did and they passed the the statue of
[03:04:15.880 --> 03:04:21.240]  liberty they they were there wasn't a dry eye in the crowd and when they came here they assimilated
[03:04:21.240 --> 03:04:25.080]  they wouldn't uh they wouldn't my grandfather wouldn't let the family speak german at home
[03:04:26.200 --> 03:04:30.280]  and they worked their way up and they lived the american dream and you know america has always
[03:04:30.280 --> 03:04:35.800]  been multicultural from the beginning but the multicultural of today where they want islands of
[03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:41.080]  of uh wherever they came from it's gang mentality it's not it's not assimilation and it's the end

[03:08:54.280 --> 03:09:01.560]  they want the ssri's antidepressants that big pharmaceuticals share a cell they want that
[03:09:01.560 --> 03:09:06.120]  given to the kids as an anecdote let me read this to you all primary care doctors this is cnn
[03:09:06.120 --> 03:09:11.960]  including pediatricians and family physicians should screen adolescents routinely for depression
[03:09:11.960 --> 03:09:17.880]  they say this is new recommendations from the us preventative services task force
[03:09:18.760 --> 03:09:23.400]  and what they're saying is they want to screen all young people between the ages of 12 and 18
[03:09:24.040 --> 03:09:29.000]  if you're younger than 12 there's not enough evidence yet say they did this first to adults
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:33.320]  they're saying yeah we need to start doing that but but really this is where they can make it happen
[03:09:33.320 --> 03:09:38.440]  because they can do this in the schools and of course it can also be a precondition
[03:09:38.440 --> 03:09:43.000]  for you getting health care treatment as the government takes over health care no no no no
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:48.920]  we have to screen you and if we think that you are at risk for depression we'll give you some
[03:09:49.640 --> 03:09:54.680]  suicide pills how's that the ssri's they say for children younger than 12 there's not enough
[03:09:54.680 --> 03:10:00.120]  evidence around which tests work and which treatments are effective to recommend that
[03:10:00.120 --> 03:10:04.920]  doctors screen all individuals in this age group yeah not yet they said the last iteration of the
[03:10:04.920 --> 03:10:10.680]  recommendations for both adolescents and adults in 2009 stated that doctors should only screen for
[03:10:10.680 --> 03:10:15.240]  depression if systems were in place to help at risk individuals get appropriate treatment and
[03:10:15.240 --> 03:10:21.160]  follow-up care but this is no longer enough they say doctors should put those systems in place and
[03:10:21.160 --> 03:10:30.280]  screen everyone soviet style okay that's what the soviet state you oppose the government it must be
[03:10:30.280 --> 03:10:36.680]  because you're insane we'll put you in an institution and we don't need to give you due process to do
[03:10:36.680 --> 03:10:42.360]  that we just need to have a doctor examine you and sign off on that okay get rid of all those
[03:10:42.360 --> 03:10:49.080]  messy legal issues about imprisoning people and then in big big subtitle headline here it says
[03:10:49.080 --> 03:10:54.040]  antidepressants are okay for adolescents that's what they're telling you guys that's the bottom
[03:10:54.040 --> 03:11:00.680]  line folks that's how the article ends the bottom line is the bottom line big bucks for big pharma
[03:11:01.320 --> 03:11:04.280]  they say another change in the current recommendation is to support the use of
[03:11:04.280 --> 03:11:08.680]  antidepressant medication for treating adolescents who have depression so first they'll tell you you
[03:11:08.680 --> 03:11:15.880]  have depression and then they will sell you their solution their ssri suicide pills known as things
[03:11:15.880 --> 03:11:21.640]  like pro's act likes a pro things that are for exiting okay individuals starting at the age of
[03:11:21.640 --> 03:11:27.400]  eight and 12 respectively they have approved those for use starting at eight years old
[03:11:29.320 --> 03:11:34.920]  these things have serious consequences for people just from a physiological standpoint
[03:11:35.640 --> 03:11:41.880]  but they wreak havoc on these children especially when they take them off so you want to start having
[03:11:41.880 --> 03:11:48.840]  physiological problems because you've been on this long term and you got to get off well you know
[03:11:48.840 --> 03:11:54.840]  that's when everything really hits the fan that's when the kids go out and they kill themselves
[03:11:54.840 --> 03:12:00.280]  sometimes kill other people sometimes they use guns sometimes they use knives but they go crazy
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:06.840]  and we've seen this over and over again we have done many many stories connecting the use of serotonin
[03:12:06.840 --> 03:12:14.280]  reuptake inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris we've done that over and over
[03:12:14.280 --> 03:12:18.840]  again but now they're going to try to extend this all the way down to eight years old and they're
[03:12:18.840 --> 03:12:23.720]  going to start screening everybody and we've got mainstream media all on the same day rolling it
[03:12:23.720 --> 03:12:30.120]  out to prepare you for this now as alex jones has been talking to chuck hunter see about revelation
[03:12:30.120 --> 03:12:37.160]  the movie we see the other way that films try to get exposed not in terms of doing a gradual roll
[03:12:37.160 --> 03:12:40.360]  out as they're trying to bring that movie out but you know you go to a film festival you try to
[03:12:40.360 --> 03:12:48.520]  roll it out that way and the people who were behind vexed subtitled from cover up to catastrophe
[03:12:48.520 --> 03:12:53.080]  and of course dr wakefield who we've had on multiple times he was the one who who made that movie
[03:12:53.640 --> 03:12:59.400]  that was going to be at tribeca and once he started getting some pushback from the mainstream
[03:12:59.400 --> 03:13:05.640]  media on that robert deniro came out and said for the first time that he had a son that suffered
[03:13:05.640 --> 03:13:09.960]  from autism and he believed that there was a connection to vaccines he and his wife both
[03:13:09.960 --> 03:13:15.720]  believed that but the pressure built up very quickly very rapidly today or yesterday i should
[03:13:15.720 --> 03:13:19.240]  say he was on the today's show might have been this morning i'm not sure i just saw the clip
[03:13:19.240 --> 03:13:25.480]  today and he was talking about why they pulled it out and i think one of the most interesting
[03:13:25.480 --> 03:13:29.320]  revelations and he talks at length about it he got very passionate about it they just kind of
[03:13:29.320 --> 03:13:34.600]  mentioned it and then it took over the interview and the lady who was with him who's basically
[03:13:34.600 --> 03:13:38.040]  kind of running the film festival you could tell she really didn't want the film she really
[03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:41.720]  didn't want to talk about this well you know we have other films we should talk about those
[03:13:41.720 --> 03:13:47.240]  other films kind of shut it down and the two anchors were there pushing all the talking points
[03:13:47.240 --> 03:13:51.080]  of the big pharmaceutical companies just as everybody's pushing the talking points
[03:13:51.080 --> 03:13:58.280]  of the big pharmaceutical companies with these mandatory screenings for teens but one of the
[03:13:58.280 --> 03:14:02.920]  things i thought was most interesting that came out of this was Robert De Niro and she
[03:14:02.920 --> 03:14:08.600]  said that it was the filmmakers who are really putting the pressure to shut this down to censor
[03:14:08.600 --> 03:14:13.480]  it don't don't let people hear that you know Robert De Niro was saying hey all i wanted
[03:14:13.480 --> 03:14:18.280]  is for the movie to be seen and people can make up their own judgment but you must see it he said
[03:14:18.280 --> 03:14:24.600]  let's find out the truth well they said filmmakers are pressuring them to not do that and i have to
[03:14:24.600 --> 03:14:29.480]  say isn't that amazing when we see filmmakers calling for censorship it's kind of like when
[03:14:29.480 --> 03:14:35.080]  meghan kelly called for donald trump to be banned in the name of the first amendment she wanted
[03:14:35.080 --> 03:14:40.200]  cnn and bill o'reilly to join her in banning donald trump from the airwaves he said you know we have
[03:14:40.200 --> 03:14:44.520]  to hang together this is for the first amendment censorship in the name of the first amendment
[03:14:45.080 --> 03:14:50.680]  and here you got filmmakers doing censorship in the name of a film festival and i would remind them
[03:14:50.680 --> 03:14:55.160]  that one of the first uses of the espionage act and of course that was something that
[03:14:56.120 --> 03:15:00.680]  has been a hallmark of the obama administration the misuse of the espionage act it was set up
[03:15:00.680 --> 03:15:05.640]  for people who were actual spies but of course obama has used it more than anybody else or
[03:15:05.640 --> 03:15:10.280]  more than all the other presidents combined to come after journalists and whistleblowers who
[03:15:10.280 --> 03:15:17.720]  are not spies labeling them as spies misusing this old act that was done around time of world war
[03:15:17.720 --> 03:15:21.640]  one and of course woodrow wilson wanted to get us involved in world war one and americans didn't
[03:15:21.640 --> 03:15:27.640]  want anything to do with it that was a time when americans understood what america first really
[03:15:27.640 --> 03:15:34.520]  represented i wish we could get some of the people that learned the bitter lessons of world war one
[03:15:34.520 --> 03:15:39.640]  when they were tricked into fighting into that war by woodrow wilson back to lecture us about
[03:15:39.640 --> 03:15:43.560]  why we need to put america first the only person talking about that now is donald trump and of
[03:15:43.560 --> 03:15:48.200]  course everybody and both republicans and democrats and the media establishment they're all looking at
[03:15:48.200 --> 03:15:53.960]  him saying is this guy crazy we have to have a world empire we can't put america first
[03:15:53.960 --> 03:15:57.880]  we need to go over there and be the world's policeman unpaid policeman the unpaid mercenaries
[03:15:57.880 --> 03:16:05.240]  of the world but back in 1917 a guy who had done the costuming for birth of a nation that was the
[03:16:05.240 --> 03:16:09.640]  d.w. griffith movie about civil war and the rise of kukleks clan through reconstruction he had
[03:16:09.640 --> 03:16:13.720]  done the costumes for that and of course that is a landmark film it's first time they did a long
[03:16:14.280 --> 03:16:21.800]  form a movie like we see today prior to that there were very short silent films well he wanted to
[03:16:21.800 --> 03:16:26.760]  a film about the american revolution he called it spared of 1776 well bad guys were guess what the
[03:16:26.760 --> 03:16:35.160]  british the people that woodrow wilson wanted us to go to war on their side and so woodrow wilson
[03:16:35.160 --> 03:16:40.760]  had him brought up on charges of aiding and abetting the enemy because you know you if you're
[03:16:40.760 --> 03:16:45.000]  against the british you're for the germans and so therefore he needs to be brought up on charges
[03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:49.640]  for the espionage act he was sentenced this film producer we're talking about coming after film
[03:16:49.640 --> 03:16:54.920]  producers again things are coming full circle aren't they we're embracing that censorship as we come
[03:16:54.920 --> 03:17:00.840]  against film producers they come against the fcc the fe fec the federal elections commission
[03:17:00.840 --> 03:17:07.800]  three of the democrats all wanted to come after joel gilbert the film producer well they sentenced
[03:17:07.800 --> 03:17:16.680]  this guy to 10 years in jail and a $5,000 fine back in 1917 that would be about $500,000 today
[03:17:16.680 --> 03:17:22.760]  because remember the federal reserve that woodrow wilson also helped to create has taken away 99
[03:17:22.760 --> 03:17:27.720]  percent of our purchasing power so that $5,000 fine that they gave him then would be a half
[03:17:27.720 --> 03:17:32.680]  million dollar fine today and a 10 year jail sentence and you say well how could they do that
[03:17:32.680 --> 03:17:40.040]  how could they send somebody to jail for doing a movie about the american revolution being too
[03:17:40.040 --> 03:17:47.080]  anti-british uh well you know that's essentially where we wind up folks and the supreme court
[03:17:47.080 --> 03:17:52.760]  was fine with that the supreme court allowed that to happen they said there is no first
[03:17:52.760 --> 03:17:59.480]  amendment for movies and they allowed that to stand until 1952 now we have filmmakers
[03:17:59.480 --> 03:18:05.480]  left the filmmakers at the tribebeca film festival saying there should be no first amendment for
[03:18:05.480 --> 03:18:11.880]  filmmakers we should censor their speech we're seeing this over and over and over again now some
[03:18:11.880 --> 03:18:15.560]  of the stuff that robert deniro said he said there's a lot of information about things that
[03:18:15.560 --> 03:18:20.680]  are happening with the cdc with the pharmaceutical companies there's a lot of things that are not
[03:18:20.680 --> 03:18:25.480]  said he said said deniro he said he felt people were trying to shut down discussion around
[03:18:25.480 --> 03:18:30.600]  vaccines and autism yeah precisely precisely and they were able to do it in his film festival as
[03:18:30.600 --> 03:18:34.760]  well he says there's more to this and meets the eye believe me he warned there's something that
[03:18:34.760 --> 03:18:39.880]  people aren't addressing and for me to get so upset here on the today show with you guys means
[03:18:39.880 --> 03:18:44.840]  there's something there part of me does regret pulling it and part of me says let it go for now
[03:18:44.840 --> 03:18:51.400]  and i'll deal with it later in another way because i didn't want the festival to be affected we have
[03:18:51.400 --> 03:18:56.280]  to get over the idea i understand it's a difficult thing you've got a lot invested in your life you
[03:18:56.280 --> 03:19:01.240]  got a lot invested in your business we all have to make those decisions at one point or the other
[03:19:01.240 --> 03:19:06.600]  and it's a tough decision and i'm not questioning his decision but when we get to the point
[03:19:07.720 --> 03:19:13.160]  where freedom and liberty mean more to us than security and safety then we'll have a country again
[03:19:13.160 --> 03:19:18.600]  he says there's a kind of hysteria a knee jerk reaction everybody should have a choice whether
[03:19:18.600 --> 03:19:25.240]  or not to take vaccines or not but it does benefit big drug companies he said so he was
[03:19:25.240 --> 03:19:30.520]  upfront and honest about that now when we look at what's happening with us so we're going to be back
[03:19:30.520 --> 03:19:37.160]  in just a moment i want to tell you what harry reid is doing out in novata remember they tried to take

[03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:29.400]  festival where the movie by dr wakefield about vaccines and an autism connection that he believes
[03:24:29.400 --> 03:24:34.760]  he discovered that was censored by the filmmakers we were told but we're going to talk about what's

[03:25:06.440 --> 03:25:10.440]  instead of brain force i would have called it brain focus because that's what it does for me it
[03:25:10.440 --> 03:25:15.720]  focuses my thoughts it gives me the words that i'm struggling to try to remember i can't remember

[03:25:27.480 --> 03:25:31.880]  it takes your concentrate brings your concentration and it doesn't do it in a way that makes you

[03:25:50.760 --> 03:25:58.120]  like to use and again 25 off brain force while supplies last this is uh and as long as this uh
[03:25:58.120 --> 03:26:03.400]  special lasts now as i was talking about with harry reid and of course we had these articles
[03:26:04.360 --> 03:26:09.080]  earlier in the day the headlines millionaires are fleeing chicago over fear of civil unrest
[03:26:09.080 --> 03:26:13.720]  what do you think they're going are they going to la you think they're going to new york no
[03:26:13.720 --> 03:26:18.040]  they're not going to go to another city just like chuck undersea was saying he doesn't like being in
[03:26:18.040 --> 03:26:22.600]  the city i don't like being in the city they don't like being in the city it's dangerous okay going
[03:26:22.600 --> 03:26:27.080]  all the way back to thomas jefferson he said uh cities are a threat to the health the wealth
[03:26:27.080 --> 03:26:30.840]  and the liberties of man well it's a lot more dangerous today especially if you have a societal
[03:26:30.840 --> 03:26:36.600]  breakdown where are they going to build their bunkers they're going out into the areas that
[03:26:36.600 --> 03:26:41.400]  the government is now making off limits to us saying they're doing it to make it into a park
[03:26:41.400 --> 03:26:46.760]  and yet they only release to the make available to the public only about one percent of these parks
[03:26:46.760 --> 03:26:53.560]  okay really not uh making it available to people we now have harry reid who is trying to take the
[03:26:53.560 --> 03:27:01.080]  last rancher in that nevada area out they had been over 50 ranchers in that area and clive
[03:27:01.080 --> 03:27:06.040]  and bundy was the last one and they were making it impossible for them they still had their grazing
[03:27:06.040 --> 03:27:12.040]  rights their water rights but they were basically drawing the lines tighter and tighter around those
[03:27:12.040 --> 03:27:16.440]  saying well you can't graze during these times of the years when you had to graze that that was
[03:27:16.440 --> 03:27:21.960]  when they needed to be there in order to make it work so restricting them continually and so as a
[03:27:21.960 --> 03:27:25.640]  protest he stopped paying his grazing fees you know what happened with all that we've talked about
[03:27:25.640 --> 03:27:31.240]  that many times but of course they backed off now that they're in jail harry reid says uh well with
[03:27:31.240 --> 03:27:36.120]  the bundies and their pals in jail now's the right time to reach out to the white house we
[03:27:36.120 --> 03:27:41.480]  white house can take their pen use the antiquities act and just say this is going to be a monument see
[03:27:41.480 --> 03:27:45.960]  if they had to make it a park they'd have to go through all these messy congressional hearings
[03:27:45.960 --> 03:27:51.560]  and they'd have to pass uh laws with legislators no he can just do it with his pen and that's what's
[03:27:51.560 --> 03:27:54.840]  really behind all this and i have to ask you you know where do the presidential candidates
[03:27:54.840 --> 03:27:59.560]  stand on this have you heard anybody ask this question of them in the debates absolutely not
[03:27:59.560 --> 03:28:03.320]  no no we're not going to talk about that we're going to talk about megan kelly's hurt feelings
[03:28:03.320 --> 03:28:08.440]  and other stuff like that okay that really matters well let me tell you what ted cruz has said about
[03:28:08.440 --> 03:28:16.360]  this ted cruz introduced senate amendment 34 56 to the bipartisan sportsman act of 2014 it would
[03:28:16.360 --> 03:28:21.800]  have prohibited the federal government from owning more than 50 of the land in any state well gee
[03:28:21.800 --> 03:28:26.120]  that's great and that magnanimous where does he come up with that figure where's that in the
[03:28:26.120 --> 03:28:31.320]  constitution 50 percent where does it say that the federal government can own any land outside of
[03:28:31.320 --> 03:28:37.800]  washington dc it doesn't says washington dc and the necessary forts and ports and things like that
[03:28:37.800 --> 03:28:42.360]  not that they're going to own 80 or 90 percent why would we draw the line at 50 percent well
[03:28:42.360 --> 03:28:47.880]  it's just part of his arbitrary living constitution approach just let's say you know i want to make the
[03:28:47.880 --> 03:28:52.040]  federal government and the insiders and washington happy the bushies who are supporting me let's just
[03:28:52.040 --> 03:28:56.680]  say 50 percent that should make the blm happy that should make the people out west happy so he
[03:28:56.680 --> 03:29:01.960]  just draws a line there look the constitution either says something or it doesn't and when you
[03:29:01.960 --> 03:29:09.560]  talk about we're going to change the constitution because of pressure or because of public opinion
[03:29:09.560 --> 03:29:18.280]  as he did with his stance on marijuana prohibition in 2014 ted cruz said that it was an abuse of
[03:29:18.280 --> 03:29:24.360]  executive power for barack obama to say that states who had voted on it in colorado and washington
[03:29:24.360 --> 03:29:30.360]  other places you need to shut them down that's an abuse of executive power no it's a recognition a
[03:29:30.360 --> 03:29:37.000]  rare recognition of the tenth amendment but now he says no that's okay i'm i'm for federalism well
[03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:42.520]  what about cocaine then i mean where does he draw the line he's not a constitutional originalist
[03:29:42.520 --> 03:29:48.360]  he is an opportunist he supports a living constitution stay with us so we'll be right back to the
[03:29:48.360 --> 03:29:54.680]  producer the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:58.600 --> 03:30:04.600]  uber admits it gave data on 12 million users to u.s government ride sharing company admits to

[03:30:34.200 --> 03:30:38.840]  and passengers none of the inquiries are believed to be related to national security since uber
[03:30:38.840 --> 03:30:43.480]  did not receive any requests issued under the provisions of national security statutes but
[03:30:43.480 --> 03:30:48.840]  in many cases they send blanket requests explaining why the information is needed or how it will be
[03:30:48.840 --> 03:30:53.560]  used uber wrote and while this kind of trip data doesn't include personal information it can reveal

[03:32:57.240 --> 03:33:15.640]  live from austin texas broadcasting
[03:33:27.560 --> 03:33:33.880]  welcome back to the alex joneshaw i'm david night and i'm joined with truck
[03:33:33.880 --> 03:33:38.360]  undersea and his wife anita and we're going to talk about revelation the movie you can find that
[03:33:38.360 --> 03:33:43.560]  a revelation the movie dot info you can also get tickets there as well right all right revelation
[03:33:43.560 --> 03:33:48.760]  the movie dot info and then one of the icons at the bottom of our home page has a tickets option
[03:33:48.760 --> 03:33:52.920]  and it goes straight to fandango and centico theaters directly and that's very important
[03:33:52.920 --> 03:33:57.320]  because what i started talking about at the beginning of the hour was how robert denier on
[03:33:57.320 --> 03:34:02.360]  the tribe becker film festival had shut down vaxed robert denier will personally personally
[03:34:02.360 --> 03:34:07.640]  wanted it but the lady who was managing it other filmmakers wanted to censor that point of view
[03:34:07.640 --> 03:34:13.560]  talk to us about why you're going straight to uh this kind of release a limited release to try to
[03:34:13.560 --> 03:34:18.200]  to show interest in that and that's what people need to understand this is where you can make
[03:34:18.200 --> 03:34:24.520]  your voice heard by supporting films like this like this film if it has a high per screen average
[03:34:24.520 --> 03:34:28.360]  then you can begin to get this and more and more screens you can get it picked up across the nation
[03:34:28.360 --> 03:34:34.120]  that's how you get the the uh get past the the gatekeepers at the film festivals and that sort of
[03:34:34.120 --> 03:34:38.680]  right we never really even tried film festivals because actually we did try a couple of festivals
[03:34:39.400 --> 03:34:44.280]  no names to be mentioned but we were turned down because of the content that they were fully liberal
[03:34:44.280 --> 03:34:50.040]  most most film festivals are you wouldn't even have a chance at south west uh here in austin so the
[03:34:50.040 --> 03:34:55.320]  point is uh we are more than the vaccine thing i mean you're not going to find anybody there i mean
[03:34:55.320 --> 03:35:01.800]  he he got some uh sympathy there because robert denier had a personal uh experience with his
[03:35:01.800 --> 03:35:06.760]  son who believed had autism because of vaccine connection but you're not going to find anybody
[03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:12.680]  that wants to run a conservative libertarian christian christian world view of the new world order
[03:35:12.680 --> 03:35:15.880]  and the coming world government you don't have to find that at any of these film festivals
[03:35:15.880 --> 03:35:20.680]  i know and and it was the same with people to be in it but like when we got charlie uh we were
[03:35:20.680 --> 03:35:24.360]  we looked and looked for it because we did commercials national commercials for years in la
[03:35:24.360 --> 03:35:29.240]  and i know that to market commercials obviously all corporations find their celebrity spokesmen
[03:35:29.240 --> 03:35:36.200]  well you can't find one nobody will stand up but in the case of this film we went we initially
[03:35:36.200 --> 03:35:42.200]  released a version early on called behel the pill horse on dvd and we thought well that that's it
[03:35:42.200 --> 03:35:47.720]  we'll do like everybody else will sell the dvds and that'll be that and then that was simultaneous
[03:35:47.720 --> 03:35:53.960]  when we did that to uh 2016 coming out being successful and the distributor contacted us and
[03:35:53.960 --> 03:36:01.960]  said hey this could be the next 2016 theatrically well what people don't realize is um the uh 2016
[03:36:02.600 --> 03:36:09.240]  was the only conservative documentary ever in theaters and it was super successful because
[03:36:09.240 --> 03:36:16.280]  the timing and that's the next to susan's the next to susan yeah and so um uh the the timing
[03:36:16.280 --> 03:36:21.800]  was perfect for them but it's more perfect for us today with this this crescendo of political
[03:36:21.800 --> 03:36:26.680]  fewer are going on with the election and to release it is perfect storm to get this message out
[03:36:26.680 --> 03:36:33.640]  and so uh the other issue that is so critical is that the american people are the average joe
[03:36:33.640 --> 03:36:38.520]  is trained like pablov's dogs to get all the information from the news from television and
[03:36:38.520 --> 03:36:44.360]  and regular radio and so when they hear a celebrity is involved in something they see it on tv they
[03:36:44.360 --> 03:36:49.640]  see it in a movie they think this is a big deal we need to pay attention so that is the ruse which
[03:36:49.640 --> 03:36:56.920]  will make this get our message out because uh uh it's a patriot community will act as paul reveres
[03:36:57.480 --> 03:37:02.760]  to go out to those gray people out there who who have a heart for america and know something wrong
[03:37:02.760 --> 03:37:07.720]  but couldn't put their finger on it then it could really explode and i like your movie much better
[03:37:07.720 --> 03:37:13.480]  than denisha susan's movie because i thought his movie started laying out the case against
[03:37:13.480 --> 03:37:18.760]  his pieces for very very long time before he ever had any rebuttal but and i thought it
[03:37:18.760 --> 03:37:23.320]  kind of drug as a documentary yours is very fast paced i've seen the whole documentary
[03:37:23.320 --> 03:37:27.560]  and it is very very fast paced because you continually mix it up with quotes from different
[03:37:27.560 --> 03:37:33.880]  people uh you've got the the central uh narrative that's going there through with uh charlie daniels
[03:37:33.880 --> 03:37:39.000]  and general boykin and alex uh jones they kind of provide a continuity there but then you're
[03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:43.560]  pulling in people with all these different uh perspectives on different uh sub issues there
[03:37:43.560 --> 03:37:51.000]  i want to give out the phone number real quickly the number is 800 259 9231 that's 800 259 9231
[03:37:51.000 --> 03:37:55.960]  if you'd like to talk to uh chuck untracee or anita about this uh movie that's coming out
[03:37:56.520 --> 03:38:02.840]  revelation the movie you can find it in revelation the movie dot info it's got a opening this friday
[03:38:02.840 --> 03:38:08.360]  and is it also saturday in houston it'll be it'll be open to the public friday uh uh in
[03:38:08.360 --> 03:38:14.040]  centico theaters which is a texas chain in richmond and tom ball which is the western side of houston
[03:38:14.040 --> 03:38:18.920]  and then uh subject to how well it is all on demand any any film stays in theaters as long as
[03:38:18.920 --> 03:38:24.360]  there's demand and so but the opening weekend weekend is critical because we have now put
[03:38:24.360 --> 03:38:29.160]  in place the deal to release it nationally which would be two to three thousand theaters
[03:38:29.160 --> 03:38:35.720]  well and so but still it has to have a smashing opening weekend to keep those people on the page
[03:38:35.720 --> 03:38:41.560]  and so this is what you can do you know we have filmmakers who want to actually censor information
[03:38:41.560 --> 03:38:45.240]  they don't want to see at these film festivals like we're talking about with vax they don't
[03:38:45.240 --> 03:38:49.480]  want that information out there of course film festivals don't want a movie like this out there
[03:38:49.480 --> 03:38:54.520]  but if you want this information to get out it's basically what you hear here on the alex jones
[03:38:54.520 --> 03:38:59.960]  show but with a documentary film you get a context to it that you can't do in the news we can't go
[03:38:59.960 --> 03:39:05.480]  back and cover how we got here in such detail as you guys can bring in all these different voices
[03:39:05.480 --> 03:39:10.360]  do it so quickly cut it tightly you just can't do that on a news broadcast what we're doing is
[03:39:10.360 --> 03:39:14.680]  giving people okay here's where we are right now give them a quick snapshot of it but you're giving
[03:39:14.680 --> 03:39:19.320]  them the whole context putting it in a historical political context that's what's so valuable about
[03:39:19.320 --> 03:39:24.440]  a documentary but you mentioned a minute ago about how it's cut and my background was national
[03:39:24.440 --> 03:39:29.560]  commercials we worked in la for over 20 years and i was a director cameraman we had our own company
[03:39:29.560 --> 03:39:36.120]  and but like commercials are cut because people's attention span today is very short you can you
[03:39:36.120 --> 03:39:40.680]  can cut things very quickly i mean you'd be shocked how much you can get in a 30 second commercial in
[03:39:40.680 --> 03:39:47.400]  terms of an edit so we had so much information to to relay that we had like i told alex earlier we
[03:39:47.400 --> 03:39:55.080]  had 42 hours of footage in in 38 rock stars the patriot community so the point was to get all of
[03:39:55.080 --> 03:40:01.960]  this information out as quickly as possible but in a comprehensive way so that anyone that watches
[03:40:01.960 --> 03:40:07.560]  it very few people would not grasp something that they're interested in and the challenge we have
[03:40:07.560 --> 03:40:11.880]  to the people that see it that don't understand what's going on is to get on the internet and
[03:40:11.880 --> 03:40:16.520]  every keyword they put in is there when they probably had no idea about any of these issues
[03:40:16.520 --> 03:40:21.160]  agenda 21 for instance yeah it's all there there's nothing new about we have in the film to the
[03:40:21.160 --> 03:40:25.640]  patriot community but we want the patriot community to get it out to those great people who don't
[03:40:25.640 --> 03:40:30.120]  know so there's well the first time i met alex he said i said i thought i'm coming to valhalla
[03:40:30.120 --> 03:40:34.120]  and i'm gonna get the answer i'm gonna i know what's gonna how we saw all this and basically he said
[03:40:34.920 --> 03:40:39.320]  and he kicked back in his chair and he said there's two issues how we're gonna fix this
[03:40:39.880 --> 03:40:46.280]  wear out your knees praying and and uh education yeah and so that's the point of this film this
[03:40:46.280 --> 03:40:52.280]  film is a tool for patriots to get out to everybody else who everybody's got friends and family who
[03:40:52.280 --> 03:40:58.600]  don't get it and uh if they did get it uh you know a general boy can tell me i'm retired on me
[03:40:58.600 --> 03:41:03.160]  i was a general boy can tell me one time if i tell you to take that hill as an example of what's
[03:41:03.160 --> 03:41:07.800]  going on and you struggle all the way the top half the men are dead and you turn around look
[03:41:07.800 --> 03:41:13.400]  behind you nobody there what's the point and that's the point we have to get americans
[03:41:13.400 --> 03:41:19.800]  americans regular americans to to you know look over their shoulder and have a lot of people behind
[03:41:19.800 --> 03:41:24.280]  them and that's very key just as we're looking at today the elite are buying bomb proof luxury
[03:41:24.280 --> 03:41:28.360]  survival bunkers they're getting out of the cities they understand what's going on i am at the same
[03:41:28.360 --> 03:41:33.480]  time yeah you are too i won't talk to you about that too at the same time they're concentrating
[03:41:33.480 --> 03:41:39.240]  us into the cities they're putting technologies in place with the self-driving cars with the boxes
[03:41:39.240 --> 03:41:43.160]  that they're going to put in that are going to be speaking to the infrastructure they talk about
[03:41:43.160 --> 03:41:47.480]  it as a vehicle to infrastructure communication they're going to mandate those boxes they're
[03:41:47.480 --> 03:41:53.320]  going to be tracking taxing and controlling our movements confining us into the cities
[03:41:53.320 --> 03:42:00.040]  concentrating us into the cities and we need to get people to wake up we call it agenda 21 and
[03:42:00.040 --> 03:42:04.680]  people's eyes just gloss over but one of the ways that you do this is tell us a little bit about
[03:42:04.680 --> 03:42:10.200]  your lifestyle and what what you do to decompress after going through these 40 plus hours of well
[03:42:10.200 --> 03:42:14.280]  you won't see it but a native will probably reach over and pinch me because she always tells me don't
[03:42:14.280 --> 03:42:19.400]  tell people but we live we lived in LA for 23 years i'm from east texas grew up in a rural
[03:42:19.400 --> 03:42:25.480]  environment and uh when we moved back here well we moved back here because our house burned and it
[03:42:25.480 --> 03:42:30.040]  was everybody was bringing their hands and i'm so sorry and you know patents on the head and it was
[03:42:30.040 --> 03:42:35.320]  happiest day of my life because i was able to see the LA skyline in the rearview mirror of my truck
[03:42:35.320 --> 03:42:42.600]  pulling horses back to texas so the point is uh we i had at that time written a a war of
[03:42:42.600 --> 03:42:47.800]  cessation civil war movie script called rebel private about texas during civil war and basically
[03:42:47.800 --> 03:42:54.680]  had it funded and when obama got in in 08 the people behind it were nervous and they said
[03:42:54.680 --> 03:42:59.960]  we're going to put this on hold and that's when we we turned this and it was a matter of providence
[03:42:59.960 --> 03:43:04.200]  was no whole story but the point is when we moved back here because of having written that script
[03:43:04.200 --> 03:43:10.040]  about civil war and very into history and my great great grandfather in 1860 with the texas ranger and
[03:43:10.600 --> 03:43:16.200]  and uh you know it's a long history in texas since the texas revolution point is i was always
[03:43:16.200 --> 03:43:21.800]  interested in history so when we moved back here and after living in malibu which is not that crowded
[03:43:21.800 --> 03:43:27.160]  but LA generally is horrendous uh we wanted to get into a really remote environment i would like to
[03:43:27.160 --> 03:43:32.920]  have moved into the middle of big bend but Anita wouldn't deal with it so uh so we found an area
[03:43:32.920 --> 03:43:38.040]  a place it's not that big it's 60 acres but it's surrounded by thousands of acres where nobody lives
[03:43:38.040 --> 03:43:45.080]  really and uh no wires no neighbors no lights and i knew about the whole uh smart meter thing
[03:43:45.080 --> 03:43:51.240]  and i wanted to be off the grid in fact we had been off the grid in in malibu so we for the first
[03:43:51.240 --> 03:43:57.800]  year we built a little germ rock farmhouse uh off rock on the place and this is where she gets
[03:43:57.800 --> 03:44:01.800]  mad at me because i tell people that we lived we had kerosene light for the first year and i
[03:44:01.800 --> 03:44:06.040]  loved it because it was so historical reading at night kerosene light and i just written the script
[03:44:06.040 --> 03:44:10.360]  for that uh civil war movie but unlike artificial light it doesn't wake you up so you can't fall
[03:44:10.360 --> 03:44:15.320]  asleep at night how do you feel about putting LA in the rearview mirror anita it was a little
[03:44:15.320 --> 03:44:22.440]  harder for me but uh i i love where we are now and i managed to get my uh grown kids to move here
[03:44:22.440 --> 03:44:29.560]  and so all of our our three children are here grown kids and they're uh children so we have eight
[03:44:29.560 --> 03:44:36.680]  grandkids they're all within the austin area so we're we're happy that's great and i see
[03:44:36.680 --> 03:44:43.240]  some eggs on your lap yes i brought i brought eggs for you and alex they're um we have chickens
[03:44:43.240 --> 03:44:49.800]  and these are our non-gmo eggs um i'm getting about a dozen a day so i'm gonna gift those to you
[03:44:49.800 --> 03:44:54.680]  oh thank you they're gorgeous orange uh yolks we wanted to be the first people that ever gave you
[03:44:54.680 --> 03:45:01.880]  eggs on your first people that haven't thrown them at me well that's great you know that's the key
[03:45:01.880 --> 03:45:06.440]  just as alex was talking to uh Stuart Rhodes earlier and he was saying hey you want to go yeah
[03:45:06.440 --> 03:45:11.080]  look at how pretty they are all the different colors from the different uh breeds there um he was
[03:45:11.080 --> 03:45:16.120]  saying that you need to know people in your neighborhood you need to start establishing
[03:45:16.120 --> 03:45:20.520]  local communities and i think that's one of the key things i keep telling people over and over again
[03:45:20.520 --> 03:45:26.520]  let's stop looking to washington for the solution we need to start trying to see ways that we can
[03:45:26.520 --> 03:45:31.480]  locally solve our problems and block washington out of our lives and certainly putting the right
[03:45:31.480 --> 03:45:35.080]  people send the right people to washington it could help to block them out of our lives but
[03:45:35.080 --> 03:45:39.800]  there's so many things we can do in terms of jury nullification other things that we can do but he's
[03:45:39.800 --> 03:45:44.040]  talking about hey know who your your neighbors are you don't have to necessarily agree with them
[03:45:44.040 --> 03:45:47.640]  politically to make sure that you're going to protect each other if there's violent crime in
[03:45:47.640 --> 03:45:53.160]  the area you know so and and it's also learning how to take care of yourself so you're not dependent
[03:45:53.160 --> 03:45:57.480]  on other people not dependent on a grid and that that's a key thing to be able to grow your own
[03:45:57.480 --> 03:46:01.800]  food that's really really important we're getting better at it and it seems like it would be easy
[03:46:01.800 --> 03:46:07.560]  enough to grow a garden and it is texas is a little tricky um because of the heat and sometimes
[03:46:07.560 --> 03:46:15.400]  drought but last year i've had a lot of tomatoes zucchini cucumber everything you would need so
[03:46:15.400 --> 03:46:21.960]  so surprising we also it's just kind of a pure more simple i'd be happy to live in the 19th
[03:46:21.960 --> 03:46:28.840]  century but it's a more simple way of less is more we use wood stoves for heat we use a windmill
[03:46:28.840 --> 03:46:35.720]  for water and uh we have horses and i have wire cutters in my saddlebags which will make texas
[03:46:35.720 --> 03:46:44.600]  open range but uh the point is it's just simpler we don't have tv we use uh um amish made propane
[03:46:44.600 --> 03:46:50.600]  refrigerator because it doesn't draw the we have solar panels so so we have electricity that's great
[03:46:50.600 --> 03:46:55.560]  still have kerosene lights with we have internet i mean we do have the basics there well you're an
[03:46:55.560 --> 03:46:59.480]  example and inspiration for all of us i want to get back to the movie because when you were here last
[03:46:59.480 --> 03:47:05.400]  time you brought with you mark collins who plays george washington and he's got a business card
[03:47:05.400 --> 03:47:10.360]  has his face on one side of it and george washington's on the other and these guys are clones i think
[03:47:10.360 --> 03:47:14.920]  he's like a 21st century clone of george washington same size and everything you've got him in this
[03:47:14.920 --> 03:47:20.520]  movie you got some great set pieces in this you were at the alamo uh that john wane had set up
[03:47:20.520 --> 03:47:25.400]  for the movie because of course the real alamo is now surrounded in a city uh it's been agenda 21
[03:47:26.280 --> 03:47:29.800]  the alamo itself so they went out in the woods built one and you got there and you were the last
[03:47:29.800 --> 03:47:33.960]  ones to film there before it burned down yeah it was the it was actually the one in dripping spring
[03:47:33.960 --> 03:47:41.400]  so the billy bob alamo uh the last the last one and and we when we filmed there uh it was a movie
[03:47:41.400 --> 03:47:47.000]  set and saw faux plaster stone and everything and half the wall was falling off the alamo we fixed
[03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:52.920]  that and uh it wasn't two weeks or three weeks after we filmed there that lightning struck the
[03:47:52.920 --> 03:47:58.280]  field and the whole thing burned down and that was amazing blessing because we i wanted to have
[03:47:58.280 --> 03:48:03.880]  reenactments and not just talking heads and bring some production value to this so that people yes
[03:48:03.880 --> 03:48:09.640]  would would have a break from all the intensity and but to me besides what alex said about where
[03:48:09.640 --> 03:48:18.120]  your knees are praying and uh and education to me the bottom line to the solution is what travis
[03:48:18.120 --> 03:48:25.560]  said for real and what travis says in the in the alamo reenactment and that is no is a powerful
[03:48:25.560 --> 03:48:32.280]  concept and that is the bottom line if americans are not willing to say no then as so many people
[03:48:32.280 --> 03:48:37.000]  have said astutely we deserve what we get that's right and you know when we go back and we look at
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:42.600]  it the entire bill of rights is a big no it's to say the government no you will not do this no you
[03:48:42.600 --> 03:48:48.040]  will not it puts a line around what the federal government can do and it says oh by the way
[03:48:48.040 --> 03:48:52.760]  if we didn't tell you that you could do it the answer is no still no okay with a ninth and tenth
[03:48:52.760 --> 03:48:58.120]  amendment brock obama understood that brock obama said hey you know that's the concept we've always
[03:48:58.120 --> 03:49:02.600]  called negative rights in other words we have individual rights and we protect those rights
[03:49:02.600 --> 03:49:05.880]  by saying there's things that the government can't do he goes well that's one idea of the
[03:49:05.880 --> 03:49:11.800]  constitution i prefer positive rights which is what the socialists say you have a right to education
[03:49:11.800 --> 03:49:16.040]  you have a right to food or this or that whatever they want to do things that they're going to
[03:49:16.040 --> 03:49:20.760]  provide for you but of course they have to take that from other people and that's the fundamental
[03:49:20.760 --> 03:49:27.080]  difference between socialism and libertarianism and he understands that yeah he's not naive about that
[03:49:27.640 --> 03:49:32.920]  and so may these people do and yet uh you know they just don't say no none of them say no well
[03:49:32.920 --> 03:49:40.280]  that and the the the thing that we see unfolding today of today's multiculturalism as opposed to
[03:49:40.280 --> 03:49:46.680]  the way it was in the 18th century is that that so many people and you know like i said as Christians
[03:49:46.680 --> 03:49:52.760]  we're we're to have empathy for all people but as americans we don't have to go with a multicultural
[03:49:52.760 --> 03:49:59.480]  concept whereby uh uh there are islands and enclaves of people that don't speak english couldn't
[03:49:59.480 --> 03:50:05.080]  care less about the constitution or our way of government and and do not assimilate that is not
[03:50:05.080 --> 03:50:09.480]  american yeah that's true if they if they don't want to play they should go somewhere else that's
[03:50:09.480 --> 03:50:14.040]  true and if you bring people in and so i heard the story that you told alex about all the your
[03:50:14.040 --> 03:50:19.640]  ancestors coming in going past the statue to liberty because you know when people come in and
[03:50:19.640 --> 03:50:24.520]  we brought a large number of people in from europe and other places during that period of time but
[03:50:24.520 --> 03:50:29.320]  if you bring people in and such large numbers as we're bringing them in now and in america and in
[03:50:29.320 --> 03:50:35.000]  europe you don't have a way to assimilate them they will not assimilate especially different
[03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:40.920]  religion language cultures are going to remain in their own ghettos and that's the point i think
[03:50:40.920 --> 03:50:46.760]  they want to balkanize the countries rather than you know having not even a tossed salad certainly
[03:50:46.760 --> 03:50:52.280]  not a melting pot okay they want to have a uh i guess you could call it a bento box but that's
[03:50:52.280 --> 03:50:55.320]  not going to work out too much more uh we're going to be right back we're going to take some of your
[03:50:55.320 --> 03:51:02.200]  calls for chuck undersea and his wife anita and the movie revelation life with extendo fight a seven

[03:51:51.240 --> 03:52:02.760]  part drop dot com when dr lane seabourn appeared on fox news and claimed that he could give seniors
[03:52:02.760 --> 03:52:09.320]  a second shot at youth viewers were highly skeptical but then they saw the proof despite being 61 years
[03:52:09.320 --> 03:52:14.120]  old dr seabourn is still competing in martial arts competitions against guys half his age
[03:52:14.120 --> 03:52:19.320]  and winning but what's even more remarkable are his lab tests that back it all up his blood pressure
[03:52:19.320 --> 03:52:26.040]  checks in at a healthy 110 or 78 his blood sugar never jumps above 70 so what's his secret seabourn

[03:52:35.160 --> 03:52:40.280]  achy joints and stiff muscles and for a limited time dr seabourn is letting you try the drink
[03:52:40.280 --> 03:52:45.640]  absolutely free all he asked is that you chip in a few bucks to help cover shipping to claim your
[03:52:45.640 --> 03:53:08.440]  free samples of patriot power greens go to greens 75 dot com greens 75 dot com greens 75 dot com
