[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:56.000]  Well, I gotta say, even though I've been here for almost six years now, I've hosted the Alex Jones show plenty of times, but pretty epic thing to think about as we go live here on this Sunday evening, October 10th, 2021 from the Infowars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:56.000 --> 01:12.000]  So we'll be hearing from Alex coming up here shortly. Owen Schroyer's gonna be sitting in. That's me for the two hour Alex Jones show Sunday evening edition live, and then Harrison Smith will be in studio hosting Sunday Night Live immediately following this transmission.
[01:12.000 --> 01:28.000]  So what I'm gonna try to do is lay out with as much current day detail as possible exactly where it is humanity is heading.
[01:28.000 --> 01:38.000]  And when you look at the signs and the symptoms and some of the clues around us right now, the picture's never been clear.
[01:38.000 --> 01:50.000]  So if you've been listening to Infowars for five years, 10 years, 20 years, you know that this has been Infowars news coverage for that period of time warning you.
[01:50.000 --> 01:57.000]  But now that it's here, I can lay it out in real time. There is no debate anymore.
[01:57.000 --> 02:09.000]  We know exactly the blueprint for the New World Order. We know exactly the blueprint for global government. And we now know exactly what that experience is going to be like. And it is, it is hellacious.
[02:09.000 --> 02:26.000]  It is a prison planet. It is global enslavement. It is the end of free will as we know it, the end of free markets as we know it, the end of free mobility as we know it, the end of cheap and easily accessible energy and communication and transportation as we know it.
[02:26.000 --> 02:37.000]  It's all done. It's all done. That rain of humans being free and humans prospering and independence and private property and all that good stuff, done, over with, kaput.
[02:37.000 --> 02:48.000]  And this is just the beginning. We really haven't even sat down at the table yet. We're just kind of being ushered to the table of the New World Order global government right now.
[02:48.000 --> 03:02.000]  So what does it look like briefly? And then Alex Jones coming up on the other side. Well, how about this stack of news where all of these flights are being canceled because of the vaccine mandates?
[03:02.000 --> 03:14.000]  People not wanting to get the deadly vaccine. So just thousands of flights being canceled almost every day now. Then you've got the hospitals having nursing and doctor shortages now. Why? Again, the vaccine mandate.
[03:14.000 --> 03:26.000]  You might say, well, why are they doing this? Why would they cripple themselves this way? That's the point. Destroy civilization. Destroy America. Destroy the free market and then bring in.
[03:26.000 --> 03:33.000]  Build back better. Oh, just like they've been telling you. So the hospitals.
[03:33.000 --> 03:45.000]  Then you've got the cargo ships waiting days, weeks, months at the ports off the coast and then what they're trying to do now to just to get these supplies inbound.
[03:45.000 --> 03:59.000]  Wild stuff there. So, so see, that's just the destruction of the economy. That's just the economic warfare. That's just the attack on our infrastructure to shut everything down, destroy it so they can build back better.
[03:59.000 --> 04:10.000]  But then over here, you have all the vaccine mandates, all the sickness, all the death from the virus made in the lab. And that was what was used to corral us.
[04:10.000 --> 04:19.000]  And you have the stories out of Lithuania and Australia and other places where they're living with this tyranny worse than anywhere else. And they're trying to warn the world how bad it is.
[04:19.000 --> 04:29.000]  We've got one of those guests coming up from Australia who'd been arrested simply for talking about a lockdown protest and he's going to be joining us in the second hour.
[04:29.000 --> 04:41.000]  And then where does it go? Because, yeah, the world's kind of waking up to this, but perhaps it's too late because the next thing they're going to hit us with is the climate tyranny.
[04:41.000 --> 04:52.000]  And they're already starting to roll that out and introduce that. And we'll still have our heads spinning from all the COVID nonsense trying to figure out that.
[04:52.000 --> 05:00.000]  And then all of a sudden there'll be wildfires and hurricanes and all this stuff and they'll say, see climate change and then the climate tyranny will be here and then it's game over.
[05:00.000 --> 05:12.000]  Back in stock, down and out, liquid sleep support. It's been out of stock for a while. It's one of three sleep aids we have at Infowarsstore.com. This one has been very popular. It's sold off the shelves.
[05:12.000 --> 05:22.000]  It's back in stock, down and out, liquid sleep support. This is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have, I would say.
[05:22.000 --> 05:30.000]  Knockout, rocket rest, both great. Comes in pill form. This is the liquid tincture and I think this is probably the most powerful one.
[05:30.000 --> 05:39.000]  Survival Shield Extrude, nascent iodine. This is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet, have you haven't done the iodine challenge? What are you waiting for now is the time.
[05:39.000 --> 05:51.000]  Supermale and superfemale vitality. Living Defense Plus and the organic greens fiber caps. We have a limited supply of these right now, but we want to sell them all out so we can order a new batch.
[05:51.000 --> 06:01.000]  It's very popular. The organic greens fiber caps, but we have all kinds of other great supplements that are great for so many different things. Take advantage of those.
[06:21.000 --> 06:29.000]  It's Sunday, October 10th, 2021. Alex Jones here starting the live broadcast today.
[06:29.000 --> 06:39.000]  Owen Schreuer and other guests he's going to be having on are about to take over and I am really attempting right now to be as calm as I can.
[06:39.000 --> 06:54.000]  Because I've illustrated the great tyranny that was coming in a very agitated way many times, but now that it's here, I think it's very important that we be calm and make our decisions about what we're going to do and then follow through on them.
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  Yes, it's good to be emotional about what's happening and to give people out of their trances.
[06:59.000 --> 07:09.000]  But now that so many people are out of their trance, it's important to consciously realize that we've been right and that we've been vindicated.
[07:09.000 --> 07:28.000]  The globalists are just as evil and bad as Republic research on them showed them to be. In fact, they're worse and we just have to now step back and assess their attack and expose who and what they are.
[07:28.000 --> 07:43.000]  And once that's done, then all the evil they're carrying out won't be able to be blamed on some side group or some minion or puppet they control, but squarely on them, squarely on their shoulders.
[07:43.000 --> 08:00.000]  I will break down some of the latest developments here in a moment and hand the baton to Owen, but first let's just pull back to one of the more viral monologues that Tucker Carlson did a few weeks ago entitled Who is in Control?
[08:00.000 --> 08:09.000]  Who is in charge with an image of the puppet president on the screen, Joe Biden? And that really is the question, isn't it?
[08:09.000 --> 08:15.000]  But it's not just a question of the fact that he's a puppet and we know he is. We're wondering who's in control of him.
[08:15.000 --> 08:30.000]  When you ask the question who is in control, that invariably leads to the United Nations and Klaus Schwab and the private mega corporations that brag that they are establishing an authoritarian world government.
[08:30.000 --> 08:47.000]  That's why I make a big deal about it that on Klaus Schwab's own Wikipedia, with a link to the Debo's group, he says we're, quote, capturing countries and capturing, quote, democracies and removing the general public from the decision making process.
[08:47.000 --> 09:03.000]  When the public's not part of the decision making process and not in charge of it, that's an authoritarian dictatorship. So when we see the left and all these people going along with tyranny, you have to understand they're on board with the corporate takeover.
[09:03.000 --> 09:16.000]  They know full well they're bad. They know full well in Europe and Australia and the UK and Canada when they march out to people's houses and beat them up at Christmas because they've got more than two people in their home.
[09:16.000 --> 09:25.000]  Or they announce on TV that if you're not double or triple vax, you can't have Christmas or that you can't look at a sunset or talk to your neighbor.
[09:25.000 --> 09:40.000]  That's all done to rub it in and break your will and demoralize you and move the overton window of what's acceptable politically to the worst depths of oppression and classical tyranny.
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.000]  We all know the saying that is associated most with authoritarian regimes.
[09:45.000 --> 09:57.000]  Alexander Schultz and Eson wrote about it in New York Archipelago and it's the knock at the door in the middle of the night, that knock at the door that comes at 3am.
[09:57.000 --> 10:13.000]  That's the telltale sign of an authoritarian state. So as our energy prices explode and as food shortages arise and as racial conflict expands and as the police are downsized and the prisons are empty to violent offenders
[10:13.000 --> 10:20.000]  and filled with Christians and those that wouldn't let their sons transition to being sterilized at age eight.
[10:20.000 --> 10:33.000]  As all of that happens, remember, it's the Fortune 500 led by just a few companies at the top, the Fortune dozen or so, and a few private families and big mega hedge funds that are in control.
[10:33.000 --> 10:52.000]  It is as Dr. Mercola said on my show Thursday, Black Rock and Vanguard. And it's the families that own and control those systems that have decided that we don't need prosperity anymore, that we need to live under poverty and control if we're allowed to live.
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  And so the question that Tucker Carlson posed, who is in charge, is everything.
[10:58.000 --> 11:04.000]  I can tell you all about the problems with the globalists are doing and how they're carrying it out, but you know what's going on.
[11:04.000 --> 11:09.000]  You read what the Davos group in the U.N. say, you are informed.
[11:09.000 --> 11:17.000]  Remember, only a small percentage of people know about globalism, know about the IMF, know about the World Bank, know about Bretton Woods,
[11:17.000 --> 11:25.000]  know about the fact that the transition is now happening to get rid of the dollar and bring in this new world currency that will track and trace and control where you can go and what you can do.
[11:25.000 --> 11:36.000]  So we have to raise the alarm now that we will very soon be in the same place that Australia and Canada are in, the very same forces who are in charge, not the puppets,
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.000]  not the prime ministers and presidents, but those who are really in charge are the globalists.
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.000]  And that was Trump's big crime. He really was the president. He really got in. He really tried to do good stuff for the country.
[11:47.000 --> 11:53.000]  He really tried to cut the, quote, middlemen out. That's the globalists that set up all the unfair trade deals, and that's why he had to be punished.
[11:53.000 --> 12:01.000]  So coming up on the broadcast today, Owen Schreuer has the Aussie Cossack, as his nickname is known, a very prominent well-spoken gentleman,
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.000]  who was just arrested for daring to come on our show and others and protest and speak out against tyranny.
[12:07.000 --> 12:13.000]  He dared to ask Americans to have peaceful demonstrations until Australian embassies in D.C. and New York,
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  and I'll be going to New York in a few weeks to do that and fulfill that promise, but just think about that.
[12:18.000 --> 12:24.000]  He got arrested. They came to his house and grabbed him, and they've been arresting thousands of other people at their houses
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.000]  who dared to go out and peacefully demonstrate as well. And so before the Aussie Cossack comes on,
[12:29.000 --> 12:36.000]  I thought I'd play a two-minute clip that just went viral today of the police coming to people's houses again and saying,
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  is this you six months ago out here at an anti-lockdown demonstration?
[12:41.000 --> 12:47.000]  And he properly rebuked them and explains they're working for powerful forces that are destroying their own futures as well.
[12:47.000 --> 12:54.000]  And we can laugh at them and say, oh, that'll never happen here, but already they just signed a law yesterday in California
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000]  that you can't have boys and girls sections in stores because that makes them want to be a bore and a girl.
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  Again, that's the depopulation, globalist control system coming in.
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  So here's that clip from Australia. We'll be right back with Owen Schreuer here on this live Sunday broadcast.
[13:07.000 --> 13:08.000]  Please spread the word.
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  Do you agree that you put some posts on Facebook?
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.000]  Nice and legalized.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  Did you put this on Facebook?
[13:15.000 --> 13:18.000]  So the question that's been raised is, were you there?
[13:18.000 --> 13:19.000]  Bob?
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  Yes.
[13:22.000 --> 13:23.000]  Is that you?
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.000]  No.
[13:24.000 --> 13:25.000]  Were you there?
[13:25.000 --> 13:26.000]  Well, does it matter?
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  You're handing me paper work saying I'll send a photo?
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  I'm not handing you anything. I'm asking a question.
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  Well, you've got the photo, don't you?
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  You've put a photo on Facebook.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  It doesn't actually confirm whether you were there or not.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  So if I say no, you're not going to give me the paperwork and you're going to go home, are you?
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  There's no paperwork here to give you this.
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  So what are we here for?
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  Are you here to serve me or...?
[13:45.000 --> 13:46.000]  No.
[13:46.000 --> 13:47.000]  No.
[13:47.000 --> 13:48.000]  It's immigration.
[13:48.000 --> 13:49.000]  Yeah, I know.
[13:49.000 --> 13:50.000]  It's just...
[13:50.000 --> 13:51.000]  It's losers.
[13:51.000 --> 13:52.000]  It is like that.
[13:52.000 --> 13:53.000]  What is this humanity?
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  Where are we going in life?
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  You've got the cops coming around here to tell me that I've been in a protest.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.000]  Six months ago.
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  Six months ago.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  To ask you if you have been in a protest.
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  How illegal is that?
[14:04.000 --> 14:05.000]  Which part?
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  Going to a protest.
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.000]  Why are you guys here?
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  Why is the police on my doorstep about a protest?
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  It's illegal.
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000]  Why?
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  Black lives matter protested two weeks before that?
[14:16.000 --> 14:17.000]  Yeah.
[14:17.000 --> 14:18.000]  Yeah, is that illegal?
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  Are you knocking on their doors?
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.000]  Maybe.
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.000]  No, you're not.
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.000]  You're not.
[14:22.000 --> 14:23.000]  It's clearly going to...
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  Why are you working for this corrupt government?
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  What are you guys doing?
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.000]  Who are you serving?
[14:28.000 --> 14:29.000]  Are you serving us?
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  Are you serving the corrupt government and health officials?
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  They want no good for you.
[14:34.000 --> 14:35.000]  They're not there for you.
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.000]  Were you there?
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.000]  What?
[14:37.000 --> 14:38.000]  Were you there?
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  You can ask my question, can't you?
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  I won't answer that.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  I'll just know you come in here.
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  What are we here for?
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.000]  What part of...
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  What the f*** do you want from me?
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  What did you understand when I first told you why we're here?
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  Well, you're asking me if I'm in a protest six months ago.
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  I don't recall.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  I do not recall.
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]  We've been asked...
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  I don't recall.
[14:59.000 --> 15:00.000]  I'm sorry.
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.000]  Because the crime's anonymous...
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.000]  I don't recall.
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.000]  I don't recall.
[15:03.000 --> 15:04.000]  Well, then we'll end the conversation.
[15:04.000 --> 15:05.000]  I don't want to say anything else.
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.000]  Go ask Andrews.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  What's your reason for breaching the chair direction?
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  What are you talking about?
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  I don't recall any health directions, mate.
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.000]  I don't watch them.
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  I'm going to tell you.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[15:26.000 --> 15:27.000]  but you want to fight?
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  You better believe you got one!
[15:29.000 --> 15:36.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[16:00.000 --> 16:06.000]  The engineers at BioProse are very excited to announce a major expansion of new products
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  into the retail consumer market.
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  Since their rollout of their first product almost a year ago,
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  they come out with four new products.
[16:14.000 --> 16:21.000]  BioDrain Pro, BioRV Pro, Biomarine Pro, and BioPorta Pro.
[16:21.000 --> 16:26.000]  For decades, oil companies and other major chemical corporations
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  have been using patented, naturally occurring, specially bred bacteria
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.000]  to eat oil spills and other toxic waste disasters.
[16:35.000 --> 16:39.000]  That's how powerful these naturally occurring microbes are.
[16:39.000 --> 16:44.000]  The BioProse system is light years better than traditional enzymes that only work once.
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  These bacteria begin to breed and live in your septic tank.
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.000]  And now it's available for the general public's use
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.000]  for the first time on the retail market, exclusively available.
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.000]  At TheBioProse.com
[17:26.000 --> 17:31.000]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg Group, who's head at the time,
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  was Klaus Schwab, and our sources in cyber confirming to us
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  that they were indeed planning to launch this great reset.
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  Well, we're now living in it.
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.000]  The purposeful collapse of the Third World and the First World,
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.000]  known as Ash, is a tyrannical corporate world government.
[17:46.000 --> 17:50.000]  The total censorship, no due process, destruction of the family,
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.000]  and then incrementally more and more deadly injections
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.000]  of poison mass creating these vaccines to poison us and depopulate us.
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.000]  This is what InfoWars is fighting. We're fighting for the future.
[18:02.000 --> 18:06.000]  I want to explain something that is absolutely seed understanding our world.
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.000]  It's very, very simple, but the most of all don't know.
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  The privately owned central banks of the world
[18:13.000 --> 18:18.000]  are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies
[18:18.000 --> 18:25.000]  and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual property, energy.
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence,
[18:28.000 --> 18:33.000]  and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that,
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  manipulate markets, but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  or it would cause massive inflation.
[18:39.000 --> 18:44.000]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy,
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  buying up everything, not to have the companies operate,
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization,
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  making the companies they do fund the only things left standing.
[18:55.000 --> 18:58.000]  This is the great reset. This is what's happening now.
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  Warn everyone. It's the only way to stop it.
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  A little more than 20 years ago, Japanese scientists discovered
[19:04.000 --> 19:09.000]  and were able to isolate a compound that is naturally in nature
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.000]  and in foods we eat, but in very, very low amounts.
[19:13.000 --> 19:16.000]  It's called PQQ or BiopQQ.
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  When you have the organic form of it, it does amazing things.
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.000]  It actually makes your telomeres last longer.
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  It doesn't make them grow, but makes them last longer in the space of the same thing.
[19:25.000 --> 19:29.000]  So it's as close to the fountain of youth as you're going to get.
[19:29.000 --> 19:32.000]  Well, DNA Force Plus has been sold out for six months.
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.000]  It's back in stock, the highest quality, PQQ, CoQ10, and so much more.
[19:37.000 --> 19:42.000]  This entire formula is about cleaning out your cells and helping your body last longer.
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  And that is so incredibly important.
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  We have it at 40% off, despite the effects that have been sold out,
[19:48.000 --> 19:51.000]  for six months at infowarstore.com.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  It's amazing. If you haven't tried DNA Force Plus, you really should.
[19:54.000 --> 19:59.000]  And for those of you that love it, it's back in stock 40% off exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[19:59.000 --> 20:21.000]  DNA Force Plus.
[20:21.000 --> 20:24.000]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones show.
[20:24.000 --> 20:31.000]  Owen Troyer in studio. We got a lot coming up, including a great guest in the second hour,
[20:31.000 --> 20:38.000]  the Aussie Cossack, who's fighting back against the medical tyranny in Australia,
[20:38.000 --> 20:44.000]  which is really a preview for the world.
[20:44.000 --> 20:47.000]  And now they're not letting anybody travel out of Australia.
[20:47.000 --> 20:51.000]  They have people locked down in their homes.
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.000]  You can't be a part of society if you don't have the vaccine.
[20:56.000 --> 21:07.000]  But let's put some context to this in case there are people tuning in that have no idea what exactly is going on,
[21:07.000 --> 21:15.000]  or in case further explanation is needed.
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  So where does this all begin?
[21:17.000 --> 21:27.000]  We have Anthony Fauci, Peter Dossick, and others doing gain-of-function spillover research with bat viruses,
[21:27.000 --> 21:38.000]  also known as the coronavirus, or now SARS-CoV-2, with the Chinese military in dozens of labs in China,
[21:38.000 --> 21:48.000]  specifically this Wuhan lab, and Google and Microsoft and others have a connection there as well.
[21:48.000 --> 22:00.000]  That virus is then released from the lab out into the world for it to spread worldwide.
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  Now, if the TV media didn't make a big deal of it, would we have ever even known about it?
[22:05.000 --> 22:12.000]  Probably not. It would have seemed just like a bad flu season.
[22:12.000 --> 22:15.000]  But all of a sudden we started changing the way we handle these things medically.
[22:15.000 --> 22:22.000]  So we did the PCR tests, multiplied so many times that anything would test positive for COVID.
[22:22.000 --> 22:30.000]  A piece of paper, a dog, a piece of fruit, a can of cola, a human, anything, a blade of grass, everything tests positive.
[22:30.000 --> 22:36.000]  So then it's every case, and then hospitals have a financial interest, so they want as many COVID cases as possible,
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  because each COVID case is a couple thousand bucks, and then if you can put them on a ventilator,
[22:40.000 --> 22:45.000]  it's a couple tens of thousands of dollars, and so the list goes on.
[22:45.000 --> 22:49.000]  And so the media drove the panic. The hospitals drove the case numbers.
[22:49.000 --> 22:57.000]  They counted any death as a COVID death, even if it was a gunshot wound, a car accident, cancer, heart attack, anything else.
[22:57.000 --> 23:07.000]  And then they were able to use that fear-mongering to drive home the shutdowns and all the tyranny we've seen since.
[23:07.000 --> 23:15.000]  So now where are you at? Well, I could get into all this news over here about the sicknesses, spreading, and the vaccines,
[23:15.000 --> 23:22.000]  but that's almost self-contained, where they always had the vaccine planned out.
[23:22.000 --> 23:27.000]  They were always going to roll it out. They were always going to make it mandatory, and they were always going to
[23:27.000 --> 23:32.000]  then make your access to society based on your vaccination status.
[23:32.000 --> 23:40.000]  And then I could get into all the tens of thousands of dead that we've seen from the COVID vaccine, but I think,
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.000]  you know what, the world isn't ready to admit that that's the case yet. That's fine.
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  It's going to be so undeniable soon, the world won't be able to deny.
[23:49.000 --> 23:55.000]  And they're already pretty much admitting that that's the case. It's the vaccine variants causing any new outbreaks,
[23:55.000 --> 24:03.000]  and you will see an uptick in the percentage and the death rate in the year 2021 because of the vaccines.
[24:03.000 --> 24:10.000]  You didn't see it in 2020. You will see it in 2021. And so maybe then the world will be ready for that.
[24:10.000 --> 24:17.000]  But so then what do you hear? You start hearing Joe Biden and you hear Justin Trudeau and Australian Prime Ministers
[24:17.000 --> 24:22.000]  and European leaders saying, what? Build back better. Build back better.
[24:22.000 --> 24:31.000]  So you tear civilization down by releasing a virus, but the real tear down of civilization is the world government's
[24:31.000 --> 24:38.000]  response to the virus, collapsing economies, economic warfare, nation sovereignty warfare,
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.000]  just the freedom over your own body and choosing what medicine you want to take.
[24:43.000 --> 24:52.000]  So just tearing all of that down so they can build back better. So here's what you're going to see as the trend for the next couple of weeks.
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.000]  And then America will have a choice and the rest of the world will have a choice if this is what we want to do,
[24:57.000 --> 25:04.000]  or if we want to go back to rational, normal, logical, sensible, common sense, reasonable civilization again.
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.000]  Or we can go into world government tyranny with no freedom or prosperity or upward growth or anything.
[25:10.000 --> 25:13.000]  We will have that choice.
[25:13.000 --> 25:21.000]  Southwest Airlines cancels thousands of flights due to air traffic control walkouts over vaccine mandate.
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  Southwest Pilots Union sues to block Airlines vaccine mandate.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  So it's a total disaster with Southwest Airlines.
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  It's going to be for all airlines soon that mandate the vaccine.
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  And then it's going to be for all air traffic controllers that get mandated the vaccine.
[25:36.000 --> 25:43.000]  And so who knows if the airports will even be operating or operational in the next month over this.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  It's not just the airlines.
[25:45.000 --> 25:51.000]  Seattle may fire 40% of police force over COVID vaccine mandate.
[25:51.000 --> 26:02.000]  All kinds of police forces are being short staffed right now and seeing mass resignations and firings because they don't want to take the deadly vaccine
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  and play Russian roulette with their body.
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  Hundreds of thousands of US troops still not fully vaccinated against COVID as deadlines loom.
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  And they're being told they will be discharged.
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  They will not be in the military anymore.
[26:13.000 --> 26:21.000]  So your law enforcement, your military, your airports all going to be shut down over this vaccine mandate, all part of the plan.
[26:21.000 --> 26:35.000]  Your hospitals, vaccine mandate, latest hurdle and organ nursing shortage.
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  Syracuse Hospital fires 78 workers for refusing COVID-19 vaccination.
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.000]  Will vaccine mandates affect existing nursing shortage?
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.000]  Absolutely.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  These are just some of the headlines, folks.
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  I could read these headlines all day long.
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.000]  New York, California, Chicago, the list just goes on and on in Texas.
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.000]  It's just everywhere.
[26:55.000 --> 27:02.000]  OK, so your police force shortage, your military shortage, your airline shortage, your hospital shortage.
[27:02.000 --> 27:03.000]  All right then.
[27:03.000 --> 27:09.000]  So tear down the economy, tear down civilization so the New World Order can build it back better.
[27:09.000 --> 27:15.000]  And then you have what's going on with the cargo ships and the oil ships and everything.
[27:15.000 --> 27:21.000]  Biggest U.T.O. U.S. retailers charter private cargo ships to sail around port delays.
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.000]  So they're not letting these shipments in, whether it's oil or cargo ships, any of the stuff.
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  They're not letting it in because of COVID.
[27:28.000 --> 27:35.000]  So now they're trying to basically do transfers on private vessels just to get it ashore.
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  Container get-ins.
[27:37.000 --> 27:40.000]  Supply crisis drives Walmart and rivals to hire their own ships.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  And you're also starting to see the shortages at the grocery stores as well.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  You're starting to see the food prices go up, the energy prices go up.
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  Port of Los Angeles demands more federal funding as cargo backlog looms.
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  Costco limits toilet paper.
[27:55.000 --> 28:00.000]  Paper towels and bottled water purchases over inflation and supply chain breakdown.
[28:00.000 --> 28:06.000]  Global supply chain crisis to last until 2023 says Middle East's largest port operator.
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  Well, that's if we stop doing it now.
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.000]  We're not going to stop doing it now.
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.000]  So you're looking 2024, 2025, forever.
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  So that's all the tyranny.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  That's the economic warfare.
[28:17.000 --> 28:26.000]  That's the shutting down and the breaking of civilization so that the average human can't get access to anything anymore until the whole world goes under medical tyranny.
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  Then they'll have the cultural warfare, but this is still just kind of blooming right now.
[28:31.000 --> 28:40.000]  Gavin Newsom signs woke law forcing stores to have gender neutral sections where traditional blue and pink toys and toothbrushes are banned.
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  So this is all their tyranny.
[28:43.000 --> 28:54.000]  This is the planned warfare against the free market, against the world economy, against the average human just having easy access to cheap energy.
[28:54.000 --> 29:00.000]  And it's all from a virus that Anthony Fauci and others help make in a lab and release on the planet.
[29:00.000 --> 29:09.000]  You'd have to be hiding under a rock not to know that vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc and other essential vitamins and minerals are essential to our bodies, to our immune systems.
[29:09.000 --> 29:12.000]  We don't have them long term. We die.
[29:12.000 --> 29:24.000]  But what a lot of people don't know is even if you have those compounds, the levels that are recommended, if you don't have deep, restful, clean sleep, your body will fall apart even faster.
[29:24.000 --> 29:30.000]  And with so many chemicals in the food and water and so much agitation in the culture and life, it's hard to settle down.
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  It's hard to relax.
[29:31.000 --> 29:32.000]  Well, let me tell you something right now.
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.000]  Down and out is an incredibly strong natural compound.
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.000]  It's got over eight compounds in it that will give you deep, pure, clean sleep.
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  And it's it's such a game changer.
[29:42.000 --> 29:50.000]  So with all the vitamins and minerals, the last big ingredient is down and out available again at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  And you know what?
[29:51.000 --> 29:56.000]  I'm going to keep it 50% off until it sells out, even though we've already sold out a half of it in just the last month.
[29:56.000 --> 30:00.000]  And we probably are going to have more for about five months.
[30:00.000 --> 30:16.000]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put in place.
[30:16.000 --> 30:22.000]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[30:22.000 --> 30:30.000]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun.
[30:30.000 --> 30:38.000]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[30:42.000 --> 30:52.000]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[30:54.000 --> 30:58.000]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[30:58.000 --> 31:14.000]  Non-compliance, non-compliance, non-compliance.
[31:28.000 --> 31:40.000]  3139 is the info-store hotline.
[31:40.000 --> 31:46.000]  info-store.com is simply the best info-store.com beats out all the rest.
[31:46.000 --> 32:00.000]  3139 is the info-store hotline.
[32:00.000 --> 32:28.000]  info-store.com is simply the best info-store.
[32:28.000 --> 32:38.000]  The globalists have told us we're a disease.
[32:38.000 --> 32:48.000]  They've told us they want to eradicate us.
[32:48.000 --> 32:58.000]  They've told us they want to eradicate us.
[32:58.000 --> 33:08.000]  They've told us they want to eradicate us.
[33:08.000 --> 33:20.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Owen Troyer.
[33:20.000 --> 33:28.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:28.000 --> 33:34.000]  So I just laid out how the global civilization, the infrastructure,
[33:34.000 --> 33:40.000]  the industries, police forces, hospitals are all under economic sabotage right now
[33:40.000 --> 33:46.000]  and medical sabotage right now all by design.
[33:46.000 --> 33:52.000]  Because, you see, there's a plan in place.
[33:52.000 --> 33:55.000]  It's called the Great Reset.
[33:55.000 --> 34:04.000]  And COVID is just one of the tools being used to bring it all to fruition.
[34:04.000 --> 34:11.000]  So that's why you're seeing all this fallout from COVID
[34:11.000 --> 34:16.000]  and it's seeming so well-planned, well-organized, well-thought-out because it was.
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.000]  It's all been by design.
[34:19.000 --> 34:26.000]  And so let's get into some more of that before I tell you the good news
[34:26.000 --> 34:32.000]  of how the world is responding and we have our guests on.
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  Here's where it goes next.
[34:34.000 --> 34:40.000]  And this is already starting to be laid out just like COVID was.
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  So it's like a game plan.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  Once you kind of see it, they can apply it to other operations.
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.000]  And so here's what's next.
[34:50.000 --> 34:55.000]  UN declares access to a clean environment, a human right.
[34:55.000 --> 35:01.000]  So the climate tyranny is going to be, it's going to look and taste
[35:01.000 --> 35:10.000]  and feel the same as the COVID tyranny, but it's going to have a different approach
[35:10.000 --> 35:17.000]  and it's going to have even more stricter regulations than from COVID.
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.000]  They're trying to get as much regulation put into place via COVID
[35:22.000 --> 35:28.000]  so that when they bring in the climate tyranny, it's already there and then they can just expand on it.
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  But so this is just the beginning.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  Oh, it's a man-made climate change.
[35:32.000 --> 35:39.000]  It's, you know, natural disasters, weather this, volcanoes, earthquakes.
[35:39.000 --> 35:42.000]  It's all going to be blamed on human activity,
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.000]  which people won't even have the logic and rational thought to realize that that's you.
[35:47.000 --> 35:48.000]  They're blaming.
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  The carbon emissions they're trying to get rid of is you.
[35:50.000 --> 35:54.000]  You are the carbon.
[35:54.000 --> 35:57.000]  The man-made climate change we need to get rid of, that's just getting rid of you.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.000]  That's getting rid of humans.
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.000]  So now they're starting to say, oh, it's the climate change that's going to kill us all.
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.000]  It's not the COVID. It's the climate change that's so bad.
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.000]  But every human has a right to a clean environment,
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  except every human doesn't even have a right to live.
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  So that's kind of ironic.
[36:20.000 --> 36:24.000]  But you're starting to see the growth of this.
[36:24.000 --> 36:30.000]  YouTube, Google, strip ads from accounts spreading climate misinformation.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  And there it is.
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  And there it is.
[36:34.000 --> 36:38.000]  So see, just like they said, well, we're going to start banning accounts
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  and censoring speech on the Internet for medical misinformation.
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  There was barely any pushback against that.
[36:43.000 --> 36:44.000]  They got away with it.
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  So now it's going to be climate misinformation.
[36:47.000 --> 36:52.000]  And that's what's so frustrating about this.
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  And I guess that's why you try to get as many people aware of this
[36:55.000 --> 36:58.000]  and awaken to this as possible, because you just figure,
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  if humans knew this was going on, they would reject it.
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.000]  If everybody knew that this was an agenda, whether you like Info Wars
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.000]  or Alec Jones or the people bringing you this information or not,
[37:08.000 --> 37:15.000]  you're going to be living under this just like we are.
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.000]  So, but see, that's the psychology of the New World Order.
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  That's the psychology of the social engineers,
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.000]  is to just seed so much hatred into civilization,
[37:27.000 --> 37:32.000]  so much hatred and division into populations
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  that people's rationality and logic and reasoning and common sense
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  will be so clouded and even overwhelmed by their hatred
[37:40.000 --> 37:43.000]  that they'll tell you to hate somebody so much
[37:43.000 --> 37:46.000]  if that person tells you to get out of the way of a bus,
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  a moving bus that's about to run them over,
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.000]  you'll say no because you hate them so much.
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  And that's the analogy here.
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  So, all the people that want to go along with the fake news
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  about Biden or about Trump or everything else
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.000]  or you want to say Info Wars is a conspiracy theorist site
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  because we talk about the New World Order,
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  we're just here telling you there's a bus coming 80 miles per hour
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  heading right toward you.
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  You're standing smack dab in its route.
[38:14.000 --> 38:20.000]  If you don't get out of the way, you're going to become mincemeat.
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  And they have the people just saying, I hate you.
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.000]  You're a racist. You're a bigot. You're a transphobe.
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  And then here comes that bus bearing down.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  There's the horn and you just...
[38:33.000 --> 38:38.000]  and you know it's coming.
[38:38.000 --> 38:44.000]  Vatican pushes for global physical redistribution to fight poverty.
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  And so then that'll be their final excuse
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.000]  or that'll be just kind of a side flavor
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.000]  like that'll be the bumpers if you're playing...
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  if you're bowling and you put bumpers up to keep the ball in the lane.
[38:57.000 --> 38:58.000]  That'll be the bumper.
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  So it's like, oh, some of this stuff over here with COVID doesn't make sense.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  But then they'll say, oh, racism, oh, poverty,
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  and that'll bump the ball back into the lane.
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  And you'll say, hey, some of this stuff with climate change over here
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  doesn't make sense if they'll say, yeah, but people are living in poverty
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  and it's black people and it's brown people, so it's even worse.
[39:13.000 --> 39:14.000]  And that'll be the bumper.
[39:14.000 --> 39:19.000]  Bump the ball back into the lane.
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  So, oh, racism, oh, poverty, oh,
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  and that's constantly keeping the bowling ball in the lane
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.000]  and not going into the gutter where it belongs
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.000]  because none of this would work
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  unless you were trying to destroy civilization.
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  And even Bill Maher gets it.
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  Bill Maher rips Biden.
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  How are we going to build back better
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  if we have no workers and no supplies?
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  Well, that's the point, though, Bill.
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  You can't build back better until you destroy.
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  You have to crack a few eggs to make an omelet.
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  So on a very rudimentary level,
[39:56.000 --> 40:01.000]  imagine you are a scientist or whatever
[40:01.000 --> 40:06.000]  and you're trying to make some sort of breakthrough research.
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  And you know that you have to test with humans
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  to make this breakthrough research.
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  So if you're a big pharma, you figure, okay,
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  I want to get mandated vaccines
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  or I want to get a universal flu vaccine
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  because I'm going to make billions of dollars.
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  I'm going to make trillions of dollars doing it.
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.000]  But I can't really successfully do that
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  unless I have human subjects to test it on.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  And they figure, hey, but you know what?
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  Yeah, I'm probably going to kill a few of my test subjects,
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.000]  but it's for the better good.
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  Well, so there have been people throughout time
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.000]  that thought that and they would do these things underground
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  like the Nazis did.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  And so they found out that's what the Nazis were doing,
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  but they'd test Jews or other people
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  and they'd just say, well, look, yeah,
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  we may be torturing these people or killing these people,
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.000]  but we're inventing super technology.
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  We're going to invent the ubermitsch, the supermen.
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  We're going to have universal technologies
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  and health and treatment and all this stuff.
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.000]  So yeah, yeah, we're testing this stuff on humans.
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  Of course we are.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  How else are we going to get to the next level?
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  Well, then you had the Nuremberg trials that said,
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.000]  look, you cannot do experimentation
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  on people without their consent.
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  So that's the whole point.
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  You're being tested on right now with a vaccine.
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.000]  Hell, first you got tested with the viral release.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  Now you're being tested on with the vaccine.
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  And they just figure they run the planet,
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  they own the planet, you're the test subjects.
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  They're going to see how deadly the virus is.
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  They're going to see how deadly the vaccines are.
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  They're going to see if they can make a universal flu vaccine
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  and how many people die because of it.
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  Well, they just figured, hey, it's good for us.
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  We're going to make billions, if not trillions.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  And it's good for the planet because we believe
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  we'll have a universal flu vaccine and we'll defeat the flu
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.000]  and we'll get the Nobel Peace Prize and we'll be heroes.
[41:57.000 --> 42:00.000]  Well, if you were thinking logically in a civilization,
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  you'd say, OK, maybe we can have room for this type of research
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  and that's fine.
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  Maybe we should let scientists and doctors and chemists
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  and stuff do research like this.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  And they'll make some innovative things
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  and they'll have some inventions.
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  But if you're going to test on humans,
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  there needs to be consent, they need to know what you're doing
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  and that's going to be the law.
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  And everybody agreed to that in the Nuremberg Code.
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  And if you do it without consent via the Nuremberg Code,
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  that's the death penalty.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  So that's where we're at right now
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  with the vaccines and the mandates.
[42:31.000 --> 42:36.000]  But again, this is just like one stepping stone
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  to the world of government tyranny
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  that we're involved in right now.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  And you might say, oh, well, we should test on criminals
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  or test on people that want to volunteer.
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  They're just testing it on everybody.
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  And so when they complete this mission,
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  the next stepping stone is the climate tyranny,
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.000]  climate lockdowns, climate mandates,
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  carbon emission mandates,
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  if they launch off this stepping stone,
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  which they are right now.
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  Now, a little more than 20 years ago,
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  Japanese scientists discovered
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  and were able to isolate a compound
[43:06.000 --> 43:09.000]  that is naturally in nature
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.000]  and in foods we eat, but in very, very low amounts.
[43:12.000 --> 43:15.000]  It's called PQQ or BiopQQ.
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.000]  When you have the organic form of it,
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  it does amazing things.
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  It actually makes your telomeres last longer.
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  It doesn't make them grow,
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  but makes them last longer in space for the same thing.
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  So it's as close to the fountain of youth
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.000]  as you're going to get.
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.000]  DNA Force Plus has been sold out for six months.
[43:32.000 --> 43:35.000]  It's back in stock, the highest quality PQQ,
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  CoQ10, and so much more.
[43:37.000 --> 43:40.000]  This entire formula is about cleaning out your cells
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  and helping your body last longer.
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  And that is so incredibly important.
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  We have it at 40% off,
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  despite the fact it's been sold out for six months,
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  It's amazing. If you haven't tried DNA Force Plus,
[43:52.000 --> 43:53.000]  you really should.
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  And for those of you that love it,
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  it's back in stock 40% off exclusively
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[43:59.000 --> 44:01.000]  DNA Force Plus.
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  I have the greatest sense of loss,
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  deep in my heart, deep in my soul.
[44:05.000 --> 44:08.000]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet,
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  I've had a lot of loss,
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  like everybody else has.
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.000]  And it's because it's a loss of
[44:15.000 --> 44:18.000]  ancestral freedom
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  that so many people fought and died
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.000]  and bled and sweat for.
[44:24.000 --> 44:27.000]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  And I see the general public,
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  DNA, medically induced,
[44:31.000 --> 44:35.000]  scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  transient.
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  And I know we're being fed
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  into this globalist meat grinder,
[44:41.000 --> 44:42.000]  and it's so incredibly sad.
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  But this is the process of
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  birth and then growth
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  and then falling apart
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  and then degenerating and collapsing
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  and then coming back to life again.
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  It's just the globalists are
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  actively trying to steer and control
[44:56.000 --> 44:58.000]  this process of decadence and collapse
[44:58.000 --> 45:01.000]  to actually end the species as we know it.
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  It was almost 15 years ago
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  that I released my seminal film
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  And in that documentary,
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  I predicted the globalists would establish
[45:11.000 --> 45:14.000]  world government, a releasing of virus,
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  and then triggering a collapse
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  of our industrial society.
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  And I've already done it.
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  How did I know they would do it?
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  Because they wrote books and white papers
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  and many of their own reports
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  and internal meetings were leaked.
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  You see, then I was tracking the
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  Bilderberg group, who's head at the time
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  was Klaus Schwab.
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  And our sources inside were confirming to us
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  that they were indeed planning to launch
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  this great reset.
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  Well, we're now living in it.
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  The purposeful collapse of the third world
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  and the first world,
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  is a process
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  destruction of the family
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  and then incrementally more and more
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  deadly injections of poison
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  masquerading as vaccines
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  to poison us and depopulate us.
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  This is what Info Wars is fighting.
[46:02.000 --> 46:19.000]  **
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  ***
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.000]  ***
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.100]  people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[46:28.100 --> 46:29.900]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[46:29.900 --> 46:34.120]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high-quality Faraday cages, many
[46:34.120 --> 46:38.400]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[46:38.400 --> 46:41.040]  grade at infowarstore.com.
[46:41.040 --> 46:45.720]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[46:45.720 --> 46:51.400]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones,
[46:51.400 --> 46:54.000]  we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.
[46:54.000 --> 46:59.720]  All there at infowarstore.com, so protect your privacy today and support the infowar
[46:59.720 --> 47:03.520]  at infowarstore.com.
[47:03.520 --> 47:29.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:29.920 --> 47:39.240]  Just in case we're not clear yet, civilization is being sabotaged intentionally right now
[47:39.240 --> 47:44.400]  so that when it collapses entirely, supply change, the energy sector, everything, when
[47:44.400 --> 47:49.720]  it collapses entirely, the globalists, the U.N. and the government can come in as the
[47:49.720 --> 47:55.720]  heroes to profit back up, you'll just have to go under and accept all the new mandates
[47:55.720 --> 48:00.240]  to accept going into the new world order as they call it.
[48:00.240 --> 48:03.520]  So that's just what's going on there.
[48:03.520 --> 48:07.840]  And Australia is perhaps the best example of what it's going to look like living under
[48:07.840 --> 48:10.720]  that tyranny or perhaps Lithuania.
[48:10.720 --> 48:16.000]  And so I'll get to that coming up here in just a minute before our guest joins.
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.880]  But ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com as you know, that is our storefront that
[48:20.880 --> 48:23.000]  makes everything we do here possible.
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.200]  And you've heard us talk about Faraday closures for your phone.
[48:27.200 --> 48:29.600]  We've sold some of them before.
[48:29.600 --> 48:33.600]  It stops the harmful radiation from coming in or out of your phone if you want to just
[48:33.600 --> 48:36.720]  go dark on your phone and not get tracked and traced.
[48:36.720 --> 48:39.680]  That's what the Faraday enclosure is for.
[48:39.680 --> 48:42.800]  And so we've put out some in the past that have had the infowar logo and they've sold
[48:42.800 --> 48:47.720]  out before and that's because just people want privacy, want to be able to have a phone
[48:47.720 --> 48:49.160]  but also have the option of privacy.
[48:49.160 --> 48:52.480]  You can't even turn them off anymore really.
[48:52.480 --> 48:56.920]  But with iPhones, even if they are off, they're still on.
[48:56.920 --> 48:59.920]  But we have a standard and that's to have the best.
[48:59.920 --> 49:02.800]  And so we now have the best available at infowarstore.com.
[49:02.800 --> 49:07.240]  So the other ones, if you've purchased them before, you notice they're kind of thin.
[49:07.240 --> 49:10.480]  Some people that say that they use them consistently every day, they start to fray.
[49:10.480 --> 49:14.640]  Well, they were really cheap and we just said, hey, let's just get as many as possible.
[49:14.640 --> 49:16.200]  There's a demand for this.
[49:16.200 --> 49:17.200]  And so we'll sell them cheap.
[49:17.200 --> 49:20.280]  We'll get them cheap and that'll just be the case since people still want them.
[49:20.280 --> 49:23.240]  And they still work fine and they got the nice logo on them and everything.
[49:23.240 --> 49:29.240]  But this is now the most elite fair day enclosure for your phone and we sell it at infowarstore.com.
[49:29.240 --> 49:30.240]  It's silent pocket.
[49:30.240 --> 49:32.400]  I've just got a couple examples right here.
[49:32.400 --> 49:34.200]  I did a test of this on the other day.
[49:34.200 --> 49:41.720]  You can actually fit two phones into one of these and actually both of my phones were
[49:41.720 --> 49:44.160]  in a case and they still fit in.
[49:44.160 --> 49:45.360]  But this thing is awesome.
[49:45.360 --> 49:51.000]  In fact, this thing, this one right here has two separate pouches that you can put it in.
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.440]  So if you want it, if you got like something else or two phones on your, like a phone and
[49:54.440 --> 49:59.760]  a tablet or something like that, I think this one does too, but I couldn't tell.
[49:59.760 --> 50:00.760]  This is the one.
[50:00.760 --> 50:04.280]  Oh yeah, this one has, this one just has one.
[50:04.280 --> 50:11.720]  But the point is you can put it in there and you're not going to have it tracking and tracing
[50:11.720 --> 50:13.040]  you.
[50:13.040 --> 50:15.160]  And so we now have the best available.
[50:15.160 --> 50:20.240]  It's 100% made in America, by the way, every stitch, every, every piece of this thing made
[50:20.240 --> 50:21.480]  in America.
[50:21.480 --> 50:22.600]  It's the silent pocket.
[50:22.600 --> 50:25.760]  It's now available at infowarstore.com.
[50:25.760 --> 50:30.280]  So we're very proud to be bringing you the most elite fair day enclosure for your phone,
[50:30.280 --> 50:36.160]  for your laptop, for your tablet now at infowarstore.com with the silent pocket.
[50:36.160 --> 50:41.440]  And don't forget while you're there, all the great supplements that we sell as well.
[50:41.440 --> 50:47.560]  The vitamin B, ultra 12, the vitamin D, winter sun, the brain force ultra that is already
[50:47.560 --> 50:54.480]  getting rave reviews, the flagship elite supplement DNA force plus that's 40% off right now.
[50:54.480 --> 50:58.760]  And so that's just part of the big sale happening, the collapse of the supply chain sale that
[50:58.760 --> 51:00.920]  we have at infowarstore right now.
[51:00.920 --> 51:05.760]  That's just us selling as much as we can, cutting prices to where we're, some of these
[51:05.760 --> 51:07.520]  we might not even be making a profit on.
[51:07.520 --> 51:13.000]  We just figure we got to just sell as much as possible to get some, some capital here
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.040]  to move on to the next round.
[51:16.040 --> 51:21.280]  Infowarsstore.com, that's what makes everything we do here possible.
[51:21.280 --> 51:24.640]  So where's it all going?
[51:24.640 --> 51:30.640]  Well, Rand Paul gets it, Rand Paul warns Americans to be afraid of your government, says watch
[51:30.640 --> 51:33.840]  lists of dissenters already exist.
[51:33.840 --> 51:34.840]  Yes.
[51:34.840 --> 51:40.480]  Now, here's one of the biggest frustrations for me and perhaps for you as well, but just
[51:40.480 --> 51:46.520]  as somebody that talks about this every day and knows what's going on, we just have a
[51:46.520 --> 51:53.480]  very small handful of leaders that are serious about this and even Rand Paul who is great
[51:53.480 --> 52:00.080]  is still maybe one of the most serious but still just kind of even on the fence a little
[52:00.080 --> 52:07.840]  bit because I get it, you know, the world's not ready to hear it's got cancer, the world's
[52:07.840 --> 52:11.800]  not ready to know that they're enslaved, the world's not ready to know that they're going
[52:11.800 --> 52:14.960]  into bondage, going into a prison planet.
[52:14.960 --> 52:19.760]  They like to live their comfort lives of whatever it is that keeps them comfortable, whether
[52:19.760 --> 52:27.280]  it's the Netflix or the pharmaceutical drugs, keeping them dumbed down, keeping them entertained.
[52:27.280 --> 52:34.400]  They're not ready to know that total bondage is on the other side of that ignorance.
[52:34.400 --> 52:40.400]  But the same thing that's going on at the southern border where you have all these governors
[52:40.400 --> 52:43.720]  meeting down there with Governor Abbott saying we're going to stop this, which they've been
[52:43.720 --> 52:46.320]  saying for years they never have.
[52:46.320 --> 52:51.120]  There's talk of a Texas border patrol now or something.
[52:51.120 --> 52:52.120]  That's fine.
[52:52.120 --> 52:53.360]  Hey look, that's a good initiative.
[52:53.360 --> 52:55.240]  You're talking about the issue.
[52:55.240 --> 52:59.760]  Nothing is going to change until the people that are facilitating the illegal immigration
[52:59.760 --> 53:02.960]  pipeline go to jail or face charges.
[53:02.960 --> 53:05.240]  Yeah, that's going to be people that work in the government.
[53:05.240 --> 53:06.240]  I get that.
[53:06.240 --> 53:07.800]  Yeah, that's kind of an unprecedented thing perhaps.
[53:07.800 --> 53:08.800]  I get that.
[53:08.800 --> 53:10.480]  It's never going to stop until they're arrested.
[53:10.480 --> 53:14.840]  So you can talk all day about how you want to protect the southern border.
[53:14.840 --> 53:18.680]  You can talk all day how you want to protect the Texas border.
[53:18.680 --> 53:24.360]  Nothing's going to happen until the people that are engaging in this illegal immigration
[53:24.360 --> 53:26.760]  pipeline are charged arrested.
[53:26.760 --> 53:28.200]  That's the only thing that's going to stop it.
[53:28.200 --> 53:29.200]  So yeah.
[53:29.200 --> 53:30.200]  Hey, I get it, Rand.
[53:30.200 --> 53:31.200]  We shouldn't be afraid of the government.
[53:31.200 --> 53:32.200]  It's totally corrupt.
[53:32.200 --> 53:35.160]  It's going into fascist totalitarianism.
[53:35.160 --> 53:37.040]  We have medical tyranny we're already facing.
[53:37.040 --> 53:39.000]  Yeah, it's kind of a big deal, Rand.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.080]  So what are we going to do about it?
[53:41.080 --> 53:43.520]  But, I mean, you're in Congress.
[53:43.520 --> 53:49.360]  Maybe rally the troops or something.
[53:49.360 --> 53:55.720]  And then you had a viral post from a couple in Lithuania, it's hard to read, but you already
[53:55.720 --> 53:57.440]  know it's going on.
[53:57.440 --> 54:03.040]  So deeply, deeply wrong, Lithuanian without vaccine passport describes life under medical
[54:03.040 --> 54:07.160]  tyranny, and it's basically you live in jail.
[54:07.160 --> 54:08.320]  You can't do anything.
[54:08.320 --> 54:09.680]  You can't go get food.
[54:09.680 --> 54:12.240]  You can't go to the park.
[54:12.240 --> 54:16.600]  That's the whole point is you need to become a subject of the one world government.
[54:16.600 --> 54:18.360]  That's the only way you're allowed to exist.
[54:18.360 --> 54:23.080]  If you don't want to be subjugated and enslaved by the one world government, you will be deemed
[54:23.080 --> 54:29.000]  a threat and a terrorist, and you will be either arrested or eliminated.
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.040]  And when the humans are doing this, it's one thing.
[54:31.040 --> 54:35.080]  Soon they'll just switch on the AI machines to run this for them, but it won't actually
[54:35.080 --> 54:36.080]  be AI.
[54:36.080 --> 54:44.400]  It'll just be machines programmed to enforce their tyranny.
[54:44.400 --> 54:45.720]  And you know, I could sit here.
[54:45.720 --> 54:49.640]  Maybe I should just pound through all of these stories with the vaccines and everything here
[54:49.640 --> 54:53.520]  because they're not working, but I guess everybody knows that.
[54:53.520 --> 54:55.600]  How many are going to be dead from these vaccines?
[54:55.600 --> 54:56.600]  50,000?
[54:56.600 --> 54:57.600]  100,000?
[54:57.600 --> 54:58.920]  Do we even know yet?
[54:58.920 --> 55:00.560]  They're covering up those numbers.
[55:00.560 --> 55:02.760]  So it's the opposite of what they were doing with COVID.
[55:02.760 --> 55:07.720]  Anybody that dies of anything died from COVID, but anybody that dies from COVID after getting
[55:07.720 --> 55:10.840]  the vaccine died from COVID, not the vaccine.
[55:10.840 --> 55:11.840]  Or they died from it.
[55:11.840 --> 55:16.280]  It's the same thing, but now they're covering up the vaccine deaths.
[55:16.280 --> 55:19.920]  Pfizer's request to okay, shots for kids are relief for parents.
[55:19.920 --> 55:20.920]  Well, not so much.
[55:20.920 --> 55:26.200]  But see, the way they sell this is, oh, it's so hard for parents to convince kids to get
[55:26.200 --> 55:28.720]  vaccines or it's so hard for schools to enforce this.
[55:28.720 --> 55:30.480]  It's so hard for businesses to enforce this.
[55:30.480 --> 55:32.000]  So we'll be the bad guy.
[55:32.000 --> 55:36.240]  We the government will be the bad guy and we'll enforce it for you.
[55:36.240 --> 55:38.800]  And then you have the excuse to just blame the government.
[55:38.800 --> 55:40.720]  Oh, that's healthy.
[55:40.720 --> 55:43.520]  That's real healthy.
[55:43.520 --> 55:45.120]  That doesn't sound dangerous at all.
[55:45.120 --> 55:47.840]  That's basically the government admitting that they're bad people.
[55:47.840 --> 55:51.160]  That's basically the government admitting that they're tyrants or that they're trying
[55:51.160 --> 55:52.960]  to enforce tyranny.
[55:52.960 --> 55:59.440]  But oh, see, the businesses know it's bad and the parents know it's bad, but now they
[55:59.440 --> 56:00.440]  can just blame the government.
[56:00.440 --> 56:01.440]  Oh, sorry.
[56:01.440 --> 56:02.440]  I got to stick you.
[56:02.440 --> 56:03.960]  I got to play Russian roulette.
[56:03.960 --> 56:04.960]  Sorry.
[56:04.960 --> 56:05.960]  The government made me do it.
[56:05.960 --> 56:06.960]  Sorry.
[56:06.960 --> 56:07.960]  I just, I know it's bad.
[56:07.960 --> 56:08.960]  I know it's no good.
[56:08.960 --> 56:09.960]  I know it sucks.
[56:09.960 --> 56:11.960]  I know it's pretty sick, but the government made me do it.
[56:11.960 --> 56:12.960]  So I just, I'm sorry.
[56:12.960 --> 56:14.960]  Oh, I'm so sorry.
[56:14.960 --> 56:15.960]  Sorry.
[56:15.960 --> 56:24.680]  Newsome faces criticism after admitting 12-year-old daughter not jabbed while pushing for vaccine
[56:24.680 --> 56:26.200]  mandates for kids.
[56:26.200 --> 56:30.840]  Yeah, of course, they're not giving their kids these jabs.
[56:30.840 --> 56:33.840]  They're not dumb.
[56:33.840 --> 56:35.240]  I guess maybe they love their kids.
[56:35.240 --> 56:37.400]  Maybe there is some hope there.
[56:37.400 --> 56:41.280]  One air says, workers must be fully vaccinated by November 24th, and it's the same thing
[56:41.280 --> 56:45.080]  as, hey, oh, you know, they make statements like, because the pilots don't want to get
[56:45.080 --> 56:48.400]  it and the airline workers don't want to get it and they just say, look, we're sorry,
[56:48.400 --> 56:49.400]  but it's the government.
[56:49.400 --> 56:50.400]  It's not us.
[56:50.400 --> 56:51.400]  Don't be mad at us.
[56:51.400 --> 56:53.680]  Just be mad at the government.
[56:53.680 --> 56:56.920]  We're just your humble airline enforcing medical tyranny.
[56:56.920 --> 56:58.680]  It's not our fault.
[56:58.680 --> 57:00.680]  The perfect end around.
[57:00.680 --> 57:06.960]  Oh, and Twitter and Facebook and everything else are pretty much blocking all give send
[57:06.960 --> 57:10.400]  go links now, including from the Pfizer whistleblower.
[57:10.400 --> 57:15.080]  I had people that were trying to share my give send go link or trying to send defend Owen
[57:15.080 --> 57:17.200]  dot com totally banned from Facebook.
[57:17.200 --> 57:19.480]  They couldn't believe it.
[57:19.480 --> 57:23.680]  I was talking to an old high school buddy, and I guess I got brought up in a conversation.
[57:23.680 --> 57:26.760]  He couldn't believe what was going on.
[57:26.760 --> 57:30.480]  And so he tried to post the thing on Facebook because he's kind of popular with my graduating
[57:30.480 --> 57:31.480]  class.
[57:31.480 --> 57:35.880]  And he was like, hey, fellow, fellow cadets, his name on high school, he's like, one of
[57:35.880 --> 57:40.440]  our brothers is being attacked by the government, tries to share the link, can't share it, then
[57:40.440 --> 57:44.000]  gets suspended from Facebook, and he sends me a message like, what the hell is going
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.000]  on?
[57:45.000 --> 57:50.240]  And I'm like, yeah, dude, you woke up, you thought you were in America, you're not.
[57:50.240 --> 57:55.000]  People ask me all the time, Alex, the last three months or so, you've had explosive energy
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.400]  on top of your already very intense level of energy.
[57:58.400 --> 57:59.400]  What's happening?
[57:59.400 --> 58:01.320]  Well, it's the things that are happening in the world right now.
[58:01.320 --> 58:02.320]  That's got my blood up.
[58:02.320 --> 58:07.400]  And also, I've gotten back in the groove of religiously taking three products every single
[58:07.400 --> 58:08.400]  day.
[58:08.400 --> 58:14.320]  DNA Force Plus that's back in stock, also, X2, deep-growth crystal iodine that's essential
[58:14.320 --> 58:19.160]  for your immune system, your whole body, and of course, at nighttime, down-and-out sleep
[58:19.160 --> 58:24.640]  aid that makes me have deeper, cleaner, restful sleep that, again, boosts my immune system
[58:24.640 --> 58:28.040]  and is good for every cell in my body and great for the spirit.
[58:28.040 --> 58:30.360]  All three of these products are in stock right now.
[58:30.360 --> 58:36.120]  They are 40% off in the case of DNA Force Plus and 50% off for one week only on Survival
[58:36.120 --> 58:42.880]  Shield X2 and, yes, until supplies last, we have down-and-out 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[58:42.880 --> 58:43.880]  This is their trifecta.
[58:43.880 --> 58:50.600]  I suggest you check it out and experience what this does for your body today.
[58:50.600 --> 58:55.280]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[58:55.280 --> 59:00.880]  between free individuals and nation-states on one side and the globalist on the other
[59:00.880 --> 59:03.880]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[59:03.880 --> 59:08.680]  For the United States and Brazil, and, of course, triggered by the Brexit in the U.K.,
[59:08.680 --> 59:12.400]  nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[59:12.400 --> 59:17.600]  That's why they launched their great recess and their programmers are collapsing us of
[59:17.600 --> 59:19.600]  Build Back Better.
[59:19.600 --> 59:25.560]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[59:25.560 --> 59:28.400]  Because they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow.
[59:28.400 --> 59:33.320]  Because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win.
[59:33.320 --> 59:36.360]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[59:36.360 --> 59:41.240]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago, except simple.
[59:41.240 --> 59:45.600]  They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns, so the global corporate combine
[59:45.600 --> 59:53.080]  released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history, expose this paradigm and we win.
[59:53.080 --> 1:00:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:13.200]  We're about to be joined by the Aussie Cossack, but first, the latest report from John Bowne.
[1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:16.360]  This is exactly what we're trying to do to start this project.
[1:00:16.360 --> 1:00:21.000]  We're calling it the Global Virome Project and a group of us are trying to get this
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:25.680]  agenda and see if it's actually fundable, see if we can get countries to get behind
[1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:30.640]  it, get agencies to get behind it, the private sector to get behind it and finally start
[1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:35.000]  to discover the total diversity of risky viruses on the planet.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:39.560]  A lot of them won't come to anything, but some of them hopefully will be the next HIV
[1:00:39.560 --> 1:00:41.520]  and will stop them before they happen.
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:48.320]  Fauci's right-hand man, Dr. Peter Dazik, sought DARPA's approval to release a deadly COVID
[1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:50.440]  virus into the wild.
[1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:56.760]  The Fauci-controlled project sought to target humans with, quote, skin-piercing nanoparticles
[1:00:56.760 --> 1:00:59.120]  to deliver hemorrhagic weapons.
[1:00:59.120 --> 1:01:04.600]  And did surveillance of bats across southern China and we've now found after, you know,
[1:01:04.600 --> 1:01:11.880]  six or seven years of doing this, over a hundred new SARS-related coronaviruses very
[1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:13.360]  close to SARS.
[1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:20.040]  Some of them get into human cells in the lab, some of them can cause SARS disease in humanized
[1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:27.680]  mice models and are un-treatable with therapeutic monoclonals and you can't vaccinate against
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:28.960]  them with the vaccine.
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:31.440]  So these are clear and present danger.
[1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:33.000]  Why don't we blow this system up?
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:38.120]  I mean, obviously, we can't just turn off the spigot on the system we have and then
[1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:41.680]  say, hey, everyone in the world should get this new vaccine we haven't given to anyone
[1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:42.680]  yet.
[1:01:42.680 --> 1:01:50.360]  But there must be some way that we grow vaccines mostly in eggs the way we did in 1947.
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:57.960]  In order to make the transition from getting out of the tried-and-true egg-growing, which
[1:01:57.960 --> 1:02:02.520]  we know gives us results that can be, you know, beneficial, I mean, we've done well
[1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:07.160]  with that to something that has to be much better.
[1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:12.440]  You have to prove that this works and then you've got to go through all of the clinical
[1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:19.240]  trials, phase one, phase two, phase three, and then show that this particular product
[1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:22.400]  is going to be good over a period of years.
[1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:27.000]  That alone, if it works perfectly, is going to take a decade.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:34.360]  There's always the potential for bioterror, and we have a major biodefense research and
[1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:40.960]  development effort that spans agencies from the NIH to do the basic research to be able
[1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:43.160]  to develop better vaccines.
[1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:46.960]  The worst bioterrorist is nature itself.
[1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:54.120]  Nature is very good at evolving microbes to create problems, much smarter than any terrorist.
[1:02:54.120 --> 1:03:03.320]  So what we've tried to do over the years is to use the expertise, the resources to allow
[1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:10.840]  us to respond better to a deliberate affront or attack on us with a microbe of any type
[1:03:10.840 --> 1:03:16.960]  engineer or what have you, to use that knowledge to better prepare us for what we know will
[1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:17.960]  happen.
[1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:23.920]  So instead of looking at in two separate silos of biodefense for biological threats that
[1:03:23.920 --> 1:03:29.920]  are deliberate and countermeasures for naturally occurring, you should essentially pool the
[1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:32.480]  science so that you could do both.
[1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:39.720]  There might be a need or even an urgent call for an entity of excitement out there that's
[1:03:39.720 --> 1:03:46.000]  completely disruptive that's not beholden to bureaucratic strings and processes.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:50.400]  So we really do have a problem of how the world perceives influenza and it's going to
[1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:58.480]  be very difficult to change that unless you do it from within and say, I don't care what
[1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:03.320]  your perception is, we're going to address the problem in a disruptive way and in an
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:05.560]  iterative way because you do need both.
[1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:12.880]  But it is not too crazy to think that an outbreak of a novel avian virus could occur in China
[1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:20.120]  somewhere, we could get the RNA sequence from that, beam it to a number of regional centers,
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:23.600]  if not local, if not even in your home at some point.
[1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:29.880]  I have been told by a lot of people that would have access to classified information, high
[1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:34.600]  level people in the CIA say, no, we know it's really a global consortium, it's a synthetic
[1:04:34.600 --> 1:04:35.600]  nanovirus.
[1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:43.360]  And now the Pentagon and DARPA released the smoking gun on Fauci's ass that he had Dazit
[1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:47.840]  come to them and say, we want to create this and secretly release it in China.
[1:04:47.840 --> 1:04:51.760]  And they said, are you crazy, the Chinese will nuke us, you maniacs.
[1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:57.080]  And you can argue if they succeed, it is the biggest thing in history.
[1:04:57.080 --> 1:05:02.280]  By now, you've heard me talk about the bio probes and how they're creating amazing products.
[1:05:02.280 --> 1:05:08.000]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bioremediation products,
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:11.240]  bringing industrial level technology to the everyday consumer.
[1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:15.360]  They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patent and delivery system.
[1:05:15.360 --> 1:05:21.080]  The bio probes are excited to release Biodrain Pro, a product specifically designed to establish
[1:05:21.080 --> 1:05:24.800]  healthy drains, pipes and overall plumbing systems.
[1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:30.720]  Biodrain Pro digests grease, fats, oil, sludge, paper and organic matter with ease.
[1:05:30.720 --> 1:05:37.000]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs and is safe for black, gray holding tanks, sewer hoses
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  and plumbing.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  It is also human and animal safe.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:44.240]  Get up to 20 treatments with the scoop for easy applications.
[1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:49.640]  Say goodbye to drain problems, gas buildups and odor, guaranteed.
[1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:50.640]  Just pour and add water.
[1:05:50.640 --> 1:05:51.640]  It's that simple.
[1:05:51.640 --> 1:06:06.560]  Visit theBioFroes.com and see for yourself.
[1:06:06.560 --> 1:06:07.560]  You found it.
[1:06:07.560 --> 1:06:09.560]  The tip of the spear.
[1:06:09.560 --> 1:06:24.640]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[1:06:24.640 --> 1:06:29.880]  We're in the second hour of the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday.
[1:06:29.880 --> 1:06:35.040]  Simon Boykov joins me now known as the Aussie Cossack and he has been arrested.
[1:06:35.040 --> 1:06:38.400]  He's been tormented by the Australian law enforcement down there.
[1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:42.560]  Only for his free speech, you've probably seen some of his videos, him being confronted
[1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:45.720]  in his car, him being confronted in his house.
[1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:48.560]  He has been arrested, but he has also been released on jail.
[1:06:48.560 --> 1:06:50.840]  He joins us now live on the air.
[1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:53.200]  Simon, where do you want to start off?
[1:06:53.200 --> 1:06:56.680]  Do you want to talk about your experience with the arrest and everything you went through
[1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:57.680]  through that process?
[1:06:57.680 --> 1:07:03.160]  Do you want to talk about where Australia is at right now as a warning for the world?
[1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:04.160]  Where do you want to begin?
[1:07:04.160 --> 1:07:05.160]  Sure.
[1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:07.920]  Firstly, thank you very much for having me on the show.
[1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:13.280]  It's very important that platforms such as InfoWars allow Aussies to get the word out
[1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:15.480]  because we're in a total information blockade.
[1:07:15.480 --> 1:07:21.960]  The mainstream media in Australia is censoring any dissent and it's almost impossible for
[1:07:21.960 --> 1:07:26.960]  Australian opposition leaders, Australian journalists who are not mainstream to get
[1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:30.120]  the word out as to what's actually occurring in the country.
[1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:35.360]  What's occurring is a full blown government fear campaign.
[1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:43.600]  There's a medical apartheid in place, just notably today this morning, some Australians
[1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:47.600]  or the government is celebrating Freedom Day, which is completely misleading.
[1:07:47.600 --> 1:07:55.600]  What they've announced is those who are juiced, those who have received the jib, can go out
[1:07:55.600 --> 1:07:59.560]  in society, can go to restaurants and so forth, but it's not Freedom Day really, it's actually
[1:07:59.560 --> 1:08:05.960]  dividing those who have agreed to take this unknown substance into their bodies and those
[1:08:05.960 --> 1:08:06.960]  who haven't agreed.
[1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:08.800]  So, it's really a false Freedom Day.
[1:08:08.800 --> 1:08:17.560]  It's actually more suited to be called the day of division, the day of medical apartheid.
[1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:25.160]  Yeah, that's like, oh, we're going to mandate everybody put a 60 pound ball around their
[1:08:25.160 --> 1:08:29.520]  ankle and that's Freedom Day, yay, you're free now, you have a ball and chain around
[1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:32.680]  your ankle, you're free.
[1:08:32.680 --> 1:08:33.680]  Exactly right, exactly right.
[1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:38.040]  That's like a prisoner who's been on the complete lockdown and then all of a sudden they give
[1:08:38.040 --> 1:08:41.760]  him three hours fresh air a day and he's excited and he's saying that's Freedom.
[1:08:41.760 --> 1:08:46.240]  So, it really is a false Freedom, it's part of the government's narrative in coercing
[1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:51.840]  the population into submission and it's a very sad state of affairs in Australia.
[1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:56.680]  We've had a lot of pressure from the police, we've actually had police resigning most notably
[1:08:56.680 --> 1:09:01.400]  a senior sergeant from Victoria, police has resigned amidst a lot of this and there are
[1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:08.040]  police that are not agreeing with the government's instructions to terrorise and demonise the
[1:09:08.040 --> 1:09:09.040]  people.
[1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:16.400]  In particular, as you mentioned, I was arrested a few days ago, right here in Sydney, during
[1:09:16.400 --> 1:09:21.800]  a live stream in fact, police stormed into my apartment and they arrested me for a breach
[1:09:21.800 --> 1:09:23.800]  of the public health order.
[1:09:23.800 --> 1:09:30.880]  Now, this is a very broad charge, but as you can see on the screen now, they arrested me
[1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:38.320]  while I was doing a live stream and they basically arrested me for being outside and breaching
[1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:39.320]  the public health order.
[1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:43.280]  Now, we have very strict rules in Australia, in Sydney you can't be more than five kilometres
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:50.440]  from your home, I was within my five kilometres, I was at about the 4.7 kilometre distance,
[1:09:50.440 --> 1:09:55.800]  I was exercising, which is a legal way to be outside, there's only a few reasons how
[1:09:55.800 --> 1:09:59.240]  you can be outside of your home and one of them is to exercise and you can see on the
[1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:05.000]  map there, the first dot in the red circle is where I live and the second dot is where
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  I was apprehended.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:10.680]  So, it's well within the five kilometre zone, it was a false arrest and the police actually
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:15.400]  admit themselves in the fact sheet, in the charge papers, they admit that the real reason
[1:10:15.400 --> 1:10:21.720]  for the arrest is that I use my YouTube channel to expose police, to film the police, we call
[1:10:21.720 --> 1:10:28.480]  it FTP which stands for filming the police and that really outrages the Australian police
[1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:35.120]  that their actions, that their misconduct, the assaults and the intimidation is caught
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:36.920]  on camera and exposed to the rest of the world.
[1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:43.040]  Of course, the local Australian mainstream media will never do this kind of real reporting
[1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:47.720]  and it's really important for independent journalists to be able to have this ability
[1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:51.520]  to live stream, to film the police, you know, it's not illegal to film the police in Australia
[1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:55.520]  so they couldn't charge me with filming the police, that's why they put on this false
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:59.960]  arrest, this false charge of breaching public health order, I was arrested, taken into custody
[1:10:59.960 --> 1:11:02.520]  and locked up at Burwood police station.
[1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:07.360]  Yeah, clearly just an intimidation factor to try to get you to stop covering the police
[1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:12.120]  or the police activity or talking about the lockdowns and everything, I mean, all you've
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:17.160]  done is be, you know, peaceful and political and just trying to, you know, get the information
[1:11:17.160 --> 1:11:22.120]  out more than anything, there have been a lot of big protests, what is the current status
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:23.120]  of that?
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:25.520]  I mean, are people still hitting the streets every day?
[1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:26.720]  Has it kind of lost momentum?
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:30.200]  Have people been arrested and bullied that they don't want to get involved?
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:34.320]  What is the status of all the protests that we've been seeing?
[1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:40.280]  What the police do is they use a tactic called catch and release or tag and release similar
[1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:45.960]  to when some, you know, animal conservationist catch a wild animal and then they tag it and
[1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:47.720]  they release it to be caught later again.
[1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:53.200]  So what the police are doing, they catch people, they put a charge on them, any charge, anything,
[1:11:53.200 --> 1:11:57.520]  something small like charging but not wearing a mask or for being, you know, one kilometer
[1:11:57.520 --> 1:12:03.280]  out of bounds or, you know, something really, really minor, not using a QR code to sign
[1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:05.160]  into a cafe, for example.
[1:12:05.160 --> 1:12:09.200]  Once they've arrested you for something small, they'll give you bail.
[1:12:09.200 --> 1:12:15.640]  But the bail conditions will say, if you breach the public ill order again under bail, then
[1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:18.320]  you're locked up automatically on remand.
[1:12:18.320 --> 1:12:25.200]  And this is how a lot of Australians are being locked up, put into prison as, you know, being
[1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:28.880]  targeted for their political views, for their protest to the government.
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:33.160]  It's a very sneaky way the tactic the police are using to lock people up.
[1:12:33.160 --> 1:12:38.880]  So currently I'm on bail and I'm under these conditions that actually say, if I approach
[1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:45.680]  a police officer within 100 meters, I'll be arrested and sent to prison.
[1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:47.280]  And I don't know how that can be enforceable.
[1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:50.920]  I mean, 100 meters, you know, if a police officer comes within me.
[1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:56.320]  So they've basically got me as a hostage in my own home and it's completely limiting
[1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:59.640]  my freedom of movement and freedom of speech and so forth.
[1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:02.400]  And it's definitely a targeted political attack.
[1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:04.680]  There's no other reason why they would do this.
[1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:08.640]  And they're shutting down protest leaders, they're targeting opposition leaders.
[1:13:08.640 --> 1:13:15.160]  They're targeting journalists who also have channels, independent media channels.
[1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:20.400]  Monica Smith, who was on your show earlier, she's also been the victim of this and she
[1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:25.560]  spent 22 days in jail and she's just a young lady who heads a group called Rigna Democracy
[1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:26.560]  Australia.
[1:13:26.560 --> 1:13:30.240]  So anyone who's a freedom fighter, anyone who's speaking up and standing up to government
[1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:35.240]  tyranny effectively paint a target on themselves.
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:38.760]  And you've already said that a lot of the police are resigning.
[1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:39.760]  How many though?
[1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:43.520]  I mean, obviously there's still enough law enforcement to crack down on the protesters
[1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:47.640]  to show up at your house and other people's house and arrest them.
[1:13:47.640 --> 1:13:54.080]  And I mean, is they going to reach a point where more police officers quit or is it never
[1:13:54.080 --> 1:13:55.080]  going to reach a threshold?
[1:13:55.080 --> 1:13:58.080]  Because I mean, if police officers keep quitting, they won't be able to enforce any of this.
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:00.120]  They won't have a force left.
[1:14:00.120 --> 1:14:02.400]  But do you think that threshold has been crossed?
[1:14:02.400 --> 1:14:05.280]  Do you think there's police that are still on the force that are going to quit in the
[1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:11.080]  future or is it now to a boil down of, okay, the police that are left enjoy doing this
[1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:13.760]  for whatever reason, they're not going to go anywhere?
[1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:21.880]  Well, you say that the people of Australia and people on the social media are talking
[1:14:21.880 --> 1:14:25.280]  about Nuremberg 2.0 trials in Australia.
[1:14:25.280 --> 1:14:32.520]  And as we know, Nuremberg was in 1946, where people who committed war crimes against the
[1:14:32.520 --> 1:14:34.680]  civilian populations were brought to trial.
[1:14:34.680 --> 1:14:43.240]  Now, we in Australia, the civilians, the free civilians, are collating information, collecting
[1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:48.480]  information, recording these events, filming these events, and we will not forget at the
[1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:51.040]  going down of the sun who will remember them.
[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:55.160]  The government can pretend to give us a freedom day today, and it's all only temporary in
[1:14:55.160 --> 1:14:57.280]  my opinion, and it's not really a freedom day.
[1:14:57.280 --> 1:15:01.080]  It's more like a day of medical discrimination and the day of division, where some people
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:06.800]  are allowed to go to the pub and have a beer, and other people, they're not allowed, it's
[1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:07.800]  illegal.
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:12.880]  They've mandated these health passports now, and they'll be checking those.
[1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:16.120]  So there's nothing to celebrate in Australia at the moment.
[1:15:16.120 --> 1:15:22.240]  The only thing we can look forward to is knowing that one day, hopefully, the people, the politicians
[1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:27.480]  that created these tyrannical laws, the politicians that ruined this great country, this lucky
[1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:31.840]  country of Australia, which was the best country in the world, they'll be brought before the
[1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:32.840]  courts.
[1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:34.480]  We've had mass resignations.
[1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:43.280]  The Premier of New South Wales, Gladys Burgicly, resigned last week in a very scandalous manner,
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:47.520]  being investigated for corruption by the Independent Commission against Corruption.
[1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:53.440]  The deputy then resigned a few days later.
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:16:23.280]  Jossi Kasek is with us, he's being politically persecuted right now.
[1:16:23.280 --> 1:16:48.600]  This is not one
[1:16:48.600 --> 1:16:50.160]  of them.
[1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:55.360]  half ago well you live to see it absolute new world order world government if you submit
[1:16:55.360 --> 1:17:01.200]  they will totally enslave you back in stock down and out liquid sleep support it's been
[1:17:01.200 --> 1:17:06.200]  out of stock for a while it's one of three sleep aids we have at info or store.com this
[1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:11.000]  one has been very popular it sold off the shelves it's back in stock down and out liquid
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:19.040]  sleep support this is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have I would say knock out
[1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:24.400]  rocket rest both great comes in pill form this is the liquid tincture and I think this
[1:17:24.400 --> 1:17:30.000]  is probably the most powerful one survival field x2 nascent iodine this is if you haven't
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:34.200]  done an iodine challenge yet have you haven't done the iodine challenge what are you waiting
[1:17:34.200 --> 1:17:40.680]  for now is the time super male and super female vitality living defense plus and the organic
[1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:45.640]  greens fiber caps we have a limited supply of these right now but we want to sell them
[1:17:45.640 --> 1:17:49.800]  all out so we can order a new batch it was very popular the organic greens fiber caps
[1:17:49.800 --> 1:17:54.520]  but we have all kinds of other great supplements that are great for so many different things
[1:17:54.520 --> 1:17:59.400]  take advantage of those.
[1:17:59.400 --> 1:18:04.040]  I want to explain something that is absolutely feed understanding our world it's very very
[1:18:04.040 --> 1:18:10.080]  simple but the most people don't know the privately owned central banks of the world
[1:18:10.080 --> 1:18:15.920]  are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies and
[1:18:15.920 --> 1:18:23.720]  using them to buy up infrastructure intellectual property energy they're using it to buy people
[1:18:23.720 --> 1:18:29.560]  to buy influence and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could
[1:18:29.560 --> 1:18:33.880]  leverage that manipulate markets but they never allowed that money to get into the general
[1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:38.440]  circulation or it would cause massive inflation now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and
[1:18:38.440 --> 1:18:43.640]  they're flooding every center of the world economy buying up everything not to have the
[1:18:43.640 --> 1:18:49.280]  companies to operate but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization
[1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:53.800]  making the companies they do find the only things left standing this is the great reset
[1:18:53.800 --> 1:18:58.160]  this is what's happening now warn everyone it's the only way to stop it.
[1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:02.880]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in game blueprint for global
[1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:08.600]  enslavement and in that documentary I predicted the globalist would establish world government
[1:19:08.600 --> 1:19:14.000]  a releasing of virus demanding that there be worldwide lock downs and then triggering
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:18.920]  a collapse of our industrial society and now they've done it how did I know they would
[1:19:18.920 --> 1:19:24.080]  do it because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and internal
[1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:29.200]  meetings were leaked you see then I was tracking the Bilderberg group whose head at the time
[1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:33.680]  was Klaus Schwab and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were indeed planning
[1:19:33.680 --> 1:19:38.640]  to launch this great reset well we're now living in it the purposeful collapse of the
[1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:43.000]  third world and the first world on its ass is a tyrannical corporate world government
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:49.240]  the total censorship no due process destruction of the family and then incrementally more
[1:19:49.240 --> 1:19:54.560]  and more deadly injections of poison mass creating these vaccines to poison us and depopulate
[1:19:54.560 --> 1:20:02.040]  us this is what info wars is fighting we're fighting for the future you're listening to
[1:20:02.040 --> 1:20:26.800]  the Alex Jones show we're back here with Simon Boykov the Aussie Cossack as he's known politically
[1:20:26.800 --> 1:20:36.840]  being persecuted for his free speech arrested for his free speech and this is just what
[1:20:36.840 --> 1:20:41.640]  you can expect when you want to stand up against tyranny on the planet if we don't have victory
[1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:46.440]  now because there's still room for victory now if we continue to resist and you know
[1:20:46.440 --> 1:20:52.120]  I'm wondering what the dynamic is like over there as we're seeing all kinds of flights
[1:20:52.120 --> 1:20:56.280]  canceled here because of people not wanting to take the forced injection so there's no
[1:20:56.280 --> 1:21:02.840]  airline crews so the flights are getting canceled by the thousands or is it more of a what where
[1:21:02.840 --> 1:21:08.800]  would you say the balance is that as far as Australian citizens are concerned is it the
[1:21:08.800 --> 1:21:13.160]  vaccinated pressuring the unvaccinated saying hey just take your vaccines we can get back
[1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:16.680]  to normal just take your vaccines you can come to the public me come on just submit
[1:21:16.680 --> 1:21:20.800]  just submit to the new world order and everything will be fine or do they stand with you and
[1:21:20.800 --> 1:21:26.520]  saying hey you have a choice to decide what medicine you take and we support you in that
[1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:30.160]  choice we don't believe that you should be discriminated from society because if you're
[1:21:30.160 --> 1:21:34.360]  unvaccinated in Australia as you were explaining you're basically a prisoner in your own country
[1:21:34.360 --> 1:21:39.440]  and you have no rights anymore even though they declare it freedom day yeah absolutely
[1:21:39.440 --> 1:21:46.680]  mate the mass vast majority of Australians who are vaccinated they stand by the unvaccinated
[1:21:46.680 --> 1:21:50.840]  in supporting their freedom to choice and which is really great to see a lot of people
[1:21:50.840 --> 1:21:54.440]  that have taken the vaccine haven't taken it because they wanted it they've taken it
[1:21:54.440 --> 1:21:59.880]  because they were forced to because they had no choice because it was a matter of you know
[1:21:59.880 --> 1:22:03.320]  basically life or death they were forced by the government basically they couldn't put
[1:22:03.320 --> 1:22:10.120]  food on the table they would be stood down from work sacked in the unable to visit friends
[1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:16.000]  family even unable to visit medical facilities we've heard reports of medical centers doctors
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:22.960]  who refuse to accept patients who do not have a vaccine passport shopping centers you know
[1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:27.200]  food outlets not allowing people in unless they can prove that they've been vexed and
[1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:32.880]  there is a small minority of people who are vaccinated who actually have this militant
[1:22:32.880 --> 1:22:37.720]  hate towards those who are unvaccinated and it's very hard to explain and it's you know
[1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:44.160]  those people who have exemptions from masks sometimes are on the receiving end of this
[1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:51.600]  this hate from people who you know are obsessed with it's almost like a cult the vaccine cult
[1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:54.560]  now they get their first jab their second jab now they're going to get their third jab
[1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:57.760]  they're going to get booster shots for the rest of their lives and they have this anger
[1:22:57.760 --> 1:23:03.280]  to those people who haven't submitted to this program and there's this hate but in generally
[1:23:03.280 --> 1:23:08.000]  speaking in general terms I think there's a lot of Australians who've taken their first
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:13.680]  shot and they've taken it with great regret and they've got guilt about it they feel you
[1:23:13.680 --> 1:23:18.880]  know really uneasy uncomfortable you know they they understand that they were forced
[1:23:18.880 --> 1:23:22.720]  and there are situations where the breadwinner of the family for example the father or the
[1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:27.880]  mother has taken the shot but she's protected her children and not given it to them so it's
[1:23:27.880 --> 1:23:32.960]  really a concerning situation and of course now that we have a situation where society
[1:23:32.960 --> 1:23:38.240]  is openly divided where people are not allowed to visit restaurants cafes supermarkets without
[1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:43.120]  showing proof of the vaccine we can only expect that things will get worse and this is not
[1:23:43.120 --> 1:23:48.640]  freedom day this is the beginning of a very very dark and scary time in Australia's history
[1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:54.640]  now of course as we open up as we open up society we all know that COVID will spread
[1:23:54.640 --> 1:23:59.440]  we all know that the vaccine doesn't prevent the spread of COVID doesn't make people immune
[1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:04.880]  right so COVID will spread and as COVID spreads at the numbers skyrocket in Australia in New South
[1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:10.800]  Wales in Queensland in New South Wales and Victoria in the states of Australia I predict
[1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:17.120]  that the vaccinated and the mainstream media will be fueling this fire will turn against
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:21.680]  those that 20 percent or so the minority who have refused the vaccination and that will be
[1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:27.440]  blamed they'll be victimised vindicated and possibly even rounded up forcefully inoculated
[1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:31.840]  and put into camps we know that there are big camps being built outside the major cities
[1:24:31.840 --> 1:24:36.240]  to house uh officially who knows who they're going to house but we can suspect that
[1:24:36.240 --> 1:24:39.600]  there will be housing political dissidents or those people who disagree
[1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:45.280]  with government health orders so the situation in Australia is very worrying and why Americans
[1:24:45.280 --> 1:24:48.720]  should be concerned and the rest of the world is because this is an experiment they're seeing how
[1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:52.480]  much can they get away with Australian people are very laid back they've got this she'll be
[1:24:52.480 --> 1:24:57.520]  right attitude and Aussies you know not people that want to start a fire or pick a fire or
[1:24:57.520 --> 1:25:04.640]  generally protest that's why they've chosen Australia as a place to push the button to push
[1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:09.440]  how far can they get away with it before they start using this experiment on other countries
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:13.200]  such as the United States so definitely United States don't give up your guns don't give up your
[1:25:13.200 --> 1:25:18.720]  rights fight for your freedom and can I say thank you to all of the people from the United States
[1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:23.680]  who are protesting in support of Aussies in support of Australians and we can see that from here we
[1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:28.080]  can see the United States in the New York outside the Australian consulate there there are freedom
[1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:33.520]  protests peaceful protests in support of the Australian population likewise in London in
[1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:40.800]  Poland and in fact while I was arrested last week while I was in the cell the police station was
[1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:46.480]  actually overwhelmed and flooded by phone calls from the United States from Canada from Texas from
[1:25:46.480 --> 1:25:52.960]  Poland from United Kingdom demanding the release of the Aussie Cossack as a political prisoner
[1:25:52.960 --> 1:25:58.560]  so can I just say a huge thank you to all of those people out there that are protesting
[1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:05.040]  peacefully and applying you know very good strategic and peaceful political pressure
[1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:11.280]  on the dictatorship which is you know unfolding in Australia which is taking hold without your
[1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:18.080]  help we're pretty much by ourselves here it's a question of will we win if we win then I'm sure
[1:26:18.080 --> 1:26:22.000]  that the Americans and the British and the rest of the world will have a better chance if we lose
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:27.680]  in Australia and we capitulate to this new world order well it's gonna it's gonna spread and it's
[1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:33.280]  gonna you know all I can say as I said to many people you're next well that's the perfect segue
[1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:37.200]  because that's what I was gonna ask is what is next what is next for you you're a political prisoner
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:44.000]  in your home country you're a second-class citizen if you don't get the vaccine so what what is next
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:50.560]  for Australia what is next for the Aussie Cossack well for me personally uh you know I don't mind
[1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:54.160]  I've signed up for this that's the life I've chosen and I'll continue fighting we're looking at
[1:26:54.160 --> 1:27:01.440]  political solutions we're teaming up with a very influential businessman and political
[1:27:02.480 --> 1:27:08.240]  personality with the name of Clive Palmer and he backs a party called the United Australia
[1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:12.960]  Party which Craig Kelly is in charge of and we think we have a real good chance at the next
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:16.720]  election to make a difference the people are not going to vote for Liberal Party or Labor Party
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:20.640]  anymore the people are sick of the mainstream parties the people want to break the backbone
[1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:26.640]  of this duopoly of these two major parties who basically have joined forces uh to vote in all
[1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:32.080]  sorts of laws and mandates against their own population so in the political sense we do
[1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:36.160]  have a very good chance as long as the elections aren't rigged and who knows they might say because
[1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:39.680]  of COVID there won't be any votes there'll be electronic voting and you know with the
[1:27:39.680 --> 1:27:43.680]  identified disrupt bill the new surveillance bills the laws that they've brought in they can alter
[1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:48.400]  any information that's online and I wouldn't be surprised if they altered the results of voting
[1:27:48.400 --> 1:27:52.080]  in fact in Australia for the last 10 years we haven't elected a prime minister we've had prime
[1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:58.160]  ministers that get sacked and resigned and they threw you know in a party intrigue within themselves
[1:27:58.160 --> 1:28:02.480]  the politicians just appoint their own mates for example New South Wales at the moment where we've
[1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:08.720]  got a premier who's just stepped into power he was not elected by the people Gladys Berejiklin
[1:28:09.280 --> 1:28:15.360]  the predecessor she resigned on the back of corruption allegations and they basically got
[1:28:15.360 --> 1:28:20.400]  together and appointed their own bloke you know 36 or what it's 36 people voted for him 36 people
[1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:24.480]  vote for a premier who's supposed to represent the whole state of New South Wales where is the
[1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:30.320]  democracy I mean if Vladimir Putin was doing this or Alexander Lukashenko you know or Gaddafi

[1:32:08.640 --> 1:32:13.520]  you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't going to be shoplifting could you imagine going
[1:32:13.520 --> 1:32:20.160]  up to a gas station and going inside the little mini mart to pay for your gas with a bandana on
[1:32:20.160 --> 1:32:24.480]  how far do you think that would get you could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school
[1:32:24.480 --> 1:32:32.080]  with it with a shield that looks like a space alien those things are offensive to us because it
[1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:37.200]  interferes with normal human interaction the globalists are running a psychological war
[1:32:37.200 --> 1:32:41.760]  for operation on humanity only waking up at the great reset in its tyranny will save us
[1:32:41.760 --> 1:32:47.200]  and the mask is the sign of slavery we must inform the public that it's a fraud and it's

[1:33:24.720 --> 1:33:30.400]  on these flights being shut down but i got all this news in front of me right here that i want to
[1:33:30.400 --> 1:33:36.080]  cover and we also have alex jones coming up in the next segment so let me do a news blitz here
[1:33:36.080 --> 1:33:45.280]  and just try to get all this news off my desk as we catapult into next week where i think the
[1:33:45.280 --> 1:33:51.040]  story of the vaccine mandate walkouts is going to become undeniable the mainstream media has been
[1:33:51.040 --> 1:33:55.600]  trying to deny it and cover it up just like they were about the cargo ships waiting off coast now
[1:33:55.600 --> 1:33:59.360]  that's mainstream news they have to admit it same thing's going to happen with these walkouts
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:04.640]  and you're going to see just disastrous images coming from airports where southwest airlines
[1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:09.760]  and others are lying to their people or their their customers saying oh no no we're going to
[1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:12.320]  have your plane we're going to have your plane there's no walkout there's nothing happening
[1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:17.120]  and then more and more people are walking out and they have no flights so there's people stranded
[1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:22.880]  at airports sleeping on the ground it's just a total chaotic scene we'll have more on that tomorrow
[1:34:23.440 --> 1:34:29.120]  and maybe more on this too just because i have to drive through it right now judicial watch
[1:34:30.080 --> 1:34:36.640]  new fda records show purchases of fetal organs heads and tissue for humanized mice project
[1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:41.680]  so this came out actually last month and i didn't see it until this month
[1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:49.440]  uh but this is just wild stuff and it's the same thing that they they were saying they weren't
[1:34:49.440 --> 1:34:58.160]  doing is buying or selling baby parts oh yes they are yes they are they're buying and selling
[1:34:58.160 --> 1:35:02.480]  baby parts you want to know what the whole abortion thing is really about folks it's about
[1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:11.520]  selling baby parts it's about population control and it's about profit selling baby parts control
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:16.400]  the population too many humans kill your baby and then there's a nice satanic energy of killing
[1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:22.160]  your offspring too and then they sell the baby parts nice that's why they're so mad at the
[1:35:22.160 --> 1:35:28.640]  Texas abortion law too because hey you know that that baby could grow into a perfectly
[1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:35.040]  sellable fetus that that that could grow into a perfectly sellable baby skull i mean they have it
[1:35:35.040 --> 1:35:41.760]  all in here an intact calvanium of baby skull eight to four uh 24 week cells for five hundred
[1:35:41.760 --> 1:35:51.840]  fifteen bucks hell yeah baby buying up those babies we chopped up we're chopping up babies
[1:35:51.840 --> 1:36:00.320]  and selling them for profit baby yeah that's what we do that's what we like oh abort that baby
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:08.720]  oh yeah it's all about female empowerment yes kill your kid forsaken as we sell the body parts for
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:26.560]  profit oh that's a nice baby you got there tell you what you know there's too many people on
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:34.480]  this planet right yeah i think you ought to let me chop it up oh yeah you don't want to deal with
[1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:42.720]  a burden of that child do you now little girlie no no you don't so let me just hurt you with that
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:49.760]  little inconvenience we call a baby there we don't want that baby causing climate change now do we
[1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:55.840]  think about you you could be free the rest of your life free of that petulant child that pesky
[1:36:55.840 --> 1:37:03.280]  nuisance you call a baby let me let me go ahead and chop it up for you we'll chop it up we'll put
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:08.880]  it on the meat meat block chop up off chop off a leg chop off a head give maybe maybe the liver's

[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:25.760]  called a child yeah that's what abortions really all about yeah Fauci spent more than 61 million
[1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:33.840]  dollars funding research with a boarded baby part yeah oh yeah i'm not just selling those
[1:37:33.840 --> 1:37:45.120]  baby parts for profit i'm giving it over to mad scientist like anthony fowchie yeah sick just
[1:37:45.120 --> 1:37:50.080]  absolutely sick uh by the way new numbers out of england
[1:37:52.800 --> 1:38:00.560]  and it's the same thing we've seen everywhere 70 percent of covid and or delta deaths 70 percent
[1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:09.520]  are fully vaccinated 70 percent are fully vaccinated and it's the vaccinated people
[1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:14.000]  that are causing the spread of the vaccine variant to the unvaccinated people and calling
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:18.480]  killing them too so the vaccinated people are killing themselves and others and that's why
[1:38:18.480 --> 1:38:22.640]  people are shutting down this vaccine program nordic countries are restricting the use of
[1:38:22.640 --> 1:38:30.800]  modernist covid vaccine here's why it's killing people fowchie warren's vaccinated people to
[1:38:30.800 --> 1:38:39.680]  wear masks outside this winter because you know the vaccine doesn't work that old bag
[1:38:40.560 --> 1:38:47.680]  joy bayhar who is uh maybe the dumbest person on tv she's she's highly competitive for that
[1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:53.440]  title joy bayhar says black people shouldn't be scared of the covid vaccine anymore because
[1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:58.560]  white people wore the experiment and so she thinks she's so genius by the way this is
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:03.840]  the same joy bayhar that did blackface but i'll come to that in a second she thinks she's so
[1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:11.280]  genius because i guess joy bayhar can read and maybe talk enough to be on tv and talk to black
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:15.280]  people and they say yeah haven't you heard of the tuskegee experiment i'm not getting an
[1:39:15.280 --> 1:39:19.600]  experimental vaccine and so joy bayhar thinks she's a genius she says oh it's white people
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:24.800]  getting tested with a vaccine because it's white people that are getting the vaccine so she's like
[1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:28.880]  look it's mostly white people that are taking the vaccine and everybody's fine so we tested on white
[1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:35.600]  people but they didn't say they were testing it they just rolled it out they didn't say oh we're
[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:41.920]  testing this vaccine but joy bayhar without even realizing it admits that the vaccine is an experiment
[1:39:41.920 --> 1:39:47.280]  she's not the brightest person and so of course her cast oh a fully vaccinated cast
[1:39:47.840 --> 1:39:52.720]  vexed up the wazoo to quote bayhar oh and they still got covid and then no way oh they didn't
[1:39:52.720 --> 1:39:58.160]  get covid it was a false test oh nobody knows and i found this funny tie it into joy bayhar
[1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:03.520]  just just the nonsense of the loony left the loony tunes left three weeks ago my professor
[1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:09.920]  played a blackface video without any warning or discussion oh my gosh oh oh so traumatizing
[1:40:09.920 --> 1:40:15.600]  in the week since my university has struggled to respond well i mean what are you going to do
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:23.200]  which is he showed blackface on the screen oh god was it joy bayhar was it justin trudeau
[1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:29.040]  was it ralph nor them i'm not sure because i see them on tv all the time and i don't see the public
[1:40:29.040 --> 1:40:37.280]  outrage but i digress australian mp unleashes on government for trying to silence him when
[1:40:37.280 --> 1:40:42.240]  mentioning iver mekton no big pharma runs the planet they chop up babies they sell up the body
[1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:46.560]  parts they experiment with vaccines worldwide and they don't want iver mekton out there because
[1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:50.720]  then they don't have their emergency use authorization for these experimental vaccines
[1:40:50.720 --> 1:40:57.440]  when there's a perfectly viable treatment iver mekton and many other things available that's
[1:40:57.440 --> 1:41:06.320]  the criminal endeavor on that front but again fauci's being fully rejected so they put out a
[1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:12.000]  fauci documentary which is just really a comedy piece if you can stomach it you have to look at
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:18.800]  it as it's just an unintentional humor but you go to all the online sources for it like youtube
[1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:26.240]  and others and it's getting i mean just on this graphic here 92 000 dislikes only 7 000 likes
[1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:33.920]  so the man is severely unpopular and then you had the and then you had the rotten tomatoes
[1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:38.960]  which is a it's it's the worst movie review website ever but for whatever it's the most popular i
[1:41:38.960 --> 1:41:45.280]  guess or so they say oh it's up to 98 000 dislikes let's get that to 100 000 just for just for fun
[1:41:45.280 --> 1:41:52.080]  well it'll be there by tomorrow oh but rotten tomatoes won't let the audience review the fauci
[1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:59.360]  documentary isn't that funny they won't let the audience review but i wonder why that could be
[1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:04.480]  anyone want to take a guess anybody in the class bueller want to take a guess uh yeah because all
[1:42:04.480 --> 1:42:11.600]  the reviews came in of f fauci and so they had to ban all the reviews by the way remember the
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:17.680]  school shooter from last week got released on bail 24 hours less than 24 hours after he shot
[1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:22.720]  four people and he was released on bail but yet they're still political prisoners being held without
[1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:28.160]  bail in this country and there are still people being treated much worse than a shooter and they
[1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:33.200]  say oh he was bullied he got robbed okay that that may be true maybe his high school experience was
[1:42:33.200 --> 1:42:40.640]  brutal and that's really sad to hear but he shot four people right right and we just released him
[1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:45.200]  on bail that's how racist america is but hey nobody gets to know about the police officer that got
[1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:50.720]  shot and killed on his day dylan harrison first day on the job as a police officer shot and killed
[1:42:50.720 --> 1:42:55.440]  leaves behind a wife and six month old baby and you won't hear his name in the news and real hero
[1:42:55.440 --> 1:42:58.880]  we'll be right back with alex jones
[1:43:25.440 --> 1:43:34.160]  we're masks and they also need you to only shop at mega corporations that way we can consolidate
[1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:42.880]  control and bankrupt the world economy leaving companies that only i own profitable you will
[1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:51.200]  then be my slaves oh and then you'll get that special shot of didim from copra will remove your
[1:43:51.200 --> 1:43:57.920]  immune system so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives the average person
[1:43:57.920 --> 1:44:02.880]  on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between free individuals
[1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:09.120]  and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other who are literally trying to create
[1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:13.840]  a post-human world for the united states of brazil and of course triggered by the briggs at the
[1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:19.840]  uk nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world ever that's why they launched
[1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:26.720]  third grade recess and their programmers are collapsing us of build back better this is nothing
[1:44:26.720 --> 1:44:33.200]  more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our guns
[1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:38.240]  because we wouldn't bow because the left which is the ideology of this world government system
[1:44:38.240 --> 1:44:45.440]  could win they released a biological weapon on us now we know two years ago we learned about it
[1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:51.040]  about 20 months ago except simple they can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns so the
[1:44:51.040 --> 1:44:56.160]  global corporate combine released over 19 and you know the rest of history expose this paradigm and
[1:44:56.160 --> 1:45:03.920]  we win it's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure
[1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:08.000]  what's happening in the atmosphere but if you look at all the different studies of reports about
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:12.880]  my nasa and other governments and other agencies they all disagree on what's really happening with
[1:45:12.880 --> 1:45:20.960]  climate the only constant the only great truth is change is the only constant so yes climate change
[1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:25.920]  is totally real but notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s 80s and then
[1:45:25.920 --> 1:45:29.680]  it's gonna be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to okay now it's
[1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:36.240]  just climate change but did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to
[1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:41.920]  the united nations and the department of energy and bill gates and the un they have weather control
[1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:47.840]  trees for 1979 bill gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time in fact back in
[1:45:47.840 --> 1:45:52.880]  1994 two scientists won a Nobel prize for an idea of spring different particles out of jet engines
[1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:58.640]  to control the weather so yes man-made climate change is real you'd have to be hiding under a
[1:45:58.640 --> 1:46:04.880]  rock not to know that vitamin d vitamin c zinc and other essential vitamins and minerals are
[1:46:04.880 --> 1:46:11.040]  essential to our bodies to our immune systems we don't have them long term we die but what a lot
[1:46:11.040 --> 1:46:16.400]  of people don't know is even if you have those compounds the levels that are recommended if you

[1:46:23.040 --> 1:46:27.680]  in the food and water and so much agitation in the culture in life it's hard to settle down it's

[1:46:55.520 --> 1:47:03.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:03.200 --> 1:47:22.880]  live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:22.880 --> 1:47:36.560]  live from the info wars because we're mobilizing populists around the world not just the united
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:44.560]  states to recognize the cause of the disease the cause of the moral decay the cause of the mental
[1:47:44.560 --> 1:47:49.760]  illness the cause of the collapsing borders and the poverty and the devaluation of the currency
[1:47:49.760 --> 1:47:54.960]  and drag queen story time and california passing a law that you can't have a boys and girls section
[1:47:55.840 --> 1:48:01.120]  they're attacking the basic biology of children they're attacking the basic biology of humans
[1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:06.320]  this isn't just some globalist operation wants to depopulate the earth so that we quote don't
[1:48:06.320 --> 1:48:12.560]  burn through resources this is a satanic system a scientific tyranny that wants to play god that
[1:48:12.560 --> 1:48:17.920]  wants to make humans commodities right out of philip k dicks to androids rim of electric sheep
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:22.880]  which was then turned into of course the film blade runner more human than human but it's not
[1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:29.920]  human it's it's anti christ it's anti god it's it's anti the natural order of humans
[1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:34.720]  and all of our generations going back over thousands and thousands and thousands of years
[1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:41.360]  it is the direct attack on free will and it is the system now rolling out their animal human hybrid
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:46.240]  clones and their new humanoid systems that they're developing and openly announcing on the news
[1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:52.480]  that they're gonna say don't just have rights but they're gonna say are endowed by their creator
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:58.560]  with even more rights than we have because the trans is the superior everyone must bow and make
[1:48:58.560 --> 1:49:04.720]  way not just for the electric car not just for the low flush toilet that's all just getting
[1:49:04.720 --> 1:49:08.960]  your acquiescence with something that sounds reasonable no you must bow and hand your sons
[1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:14.320]  over to be chemically castrated you must hand your daughters over to the system to be properly
[1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:20.000]  formed into the globalist paradigm and so we can talk all day about the symptoms but striking at
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:24.240]  the core globalism what the major corporations are setting up and the fact that where they want to
[1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:30.880]  take us is forced depopulation and that now we're here with the medical id with the world id with
[1:49:30.880 --> 1:49:36.480]  the carbon tax with the announcements of corporate rule yes there's a lot of really positive articles
[1:49:36.480 --> 1:49:41.280]  and a lot of big developments out there that are good but people are still fighting back against
[1:49:41.280 --> 1:49:46.640]  what they instinctively know to be taking their rights and oppressing them instead of pointing out
[1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:53.360]  that globalism is about corporate fascism by the governments working with the corporations
[1:49:53.360 --> 1:49:57.840]  who actually put the politicians into the government and so we try to change the government so we
[1:49:57.840 --> 1:50:02.560]  try to you know blame the puppets which is important but it's more importantly to understand
[1:50:03.280 --> 1:50:06.960]  who is installing these puppets and who is controlling these puppets or we have no future and
[1:50:06.960 --> 1:50:10.560]  I know all of you are not disagreeing with me right now what I'm saying is totally common sense
[1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:13.760]  you get it it's why you do this broadcast because you're not just listeners you're not just an
[1:50:13.760 --> 1:50:20.320]  audience you are activist you understand what's happening you're pro-human and so now how do we
[1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:26.240]  get our senators our congressmen and women and our state reps and others how do we get them
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:30.640]  to join us in this fight how do we get them to identify the fact that we're in a war because
[1:50:30.640 --> 1:50:36.240]  if we cannot identify the fact that we're in a war and know who runs that war and know who our
[1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:41.520]  enemies are and know what their goals are and all we do is fight the symptoms of the disease we're
[1:50:41.520 --> 1:50:46.800]  doomed and that's why they went in four wars off the air because they understand we've got their
[1:50:46.800 --> 1:50:52.000]  number we read the books they write we read the white papers and we're trying to get other people
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:56.880]  to get interested in how the world really works the globalists are almost incomplete control the
[1:50:56.880 --> 1:51:01.520]  planet they control the issuance of currency they're putting out their GMO crops they're putting
[1:51:01.520 --> 1:51:07.280]  out their GMO animals they're putting out their GMO chimeras and they are establishing a system
[1:51:07.280 --> 1:51:13.680]  where they're openly saying that their abominations that their creations are more human than human
[1:51:13.680 --> 1:51:19.840]  that their creations are better than us that's why they'll move heaven earth for a quote man who
[1:51:19.840 --> 1:51:27.120]  now says he's a woman that's why they'll try to order female nurses to do gynecological
[1:51:27.120 --> 1:51:32.800]  examinations on men and say that a penis is a cervix because if they could make you accept that
[1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:37.680]  they could make you accept anything they want including a so-called vaccine it's not a vaccine
[1:51:37.680 --> 1:51:42.960]  a so-called approved vaccine that wasn't approved and a vaccine if you go to info wars.com we have
[1:51:42.960 --> 1:51:48.720]  the illustrations from john hobkins with their own data admitting that the highest hospitalizations the
[1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:54.160]  highest illnesses the highest deaths in the world are in all the countries that have done the highest
[1:51:54.160 --> 1:52:00.000]  levels of these injections so it's the same cult of a man as a woman a woman as a man up as down
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:07.040]  down as up and these shots are good for you see it had a headline on friday oh the the shots don't
[1:52:07.040 --> 1:52:12.080]  work but it's okay there'll be new boosters that will then the israeli studies said that if they
[1:52:12.080 --> 1:52:16.480]  make you sicker and do nothing but make you more susceptible to other viruses this is
[1:52:17.280 --> 1:52:22.560]  evil hidden in plain view and the general public just cannot believe and get their minds around the
[1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:27.120]  fact that it's actually happening and we're here walking people through historically how it's happened
[1:52:27.120 --> 1:52:32.720]  before and now a high-tech version of it is happening today and that's why it's so important
[1:52:32.720 --> 1:52:36.640]  in all you realize that you are the hope of humanity god working through you and if you don't
[1:52:36.640 --> 1:52:41.520]  share these articles in the videos if you don't support the local stations if you don't tell
[1:52:41.520 --> 1:52:46.080]  strangers and neighbors and co-workers and friends and family that the truth lives and that we're
[1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:51.520]  under attack and then and that it's a great reset corporate planetary takeover a new type of war
[1:52:51.520 --> 1:52:55.760]  we don't have a future and our children don't have a future it's going to become more evident in
[1:52:55.760 --> 1:53:00.800]  the months and years to come that this is the reality and you could decide now to get ready
[1:53:00.800 --> 1:53:04.800]  and be a leader in this fight or you can decide to keep your head down and hope they pass over you
[1:53:04.800 --> 1:53:09.200]  but i'll assure you god's watching and i wouldn't want to be somebody that's awake to all this who
[1:53:09.200 --> 1:53:13.600]  doesn't take action against it and i sure wouldn't want to be those that know what's really going on
[1:53:13.600 --> 1:53:20.480]  and choose to join the enemy because that is the ultimate sin to know god's real to know the devil's
[1:53:20.480 --> 1:53:27.840]  real and to willfully decide to join this spirit of destruction the spirit of anti-human animus
[1:53:28.400 --> 1:53:32.480]  that's launching these attacks so to the political prisoner we had on the day and to
[1:53:32.480 --> 1:53:36.720]  everybody else it makes this broadcast possible we salute you all the sos that we've all heard

[1:54:20.480 --> 1:54:25.680]  hosting sunday night live uh this just shows you first of all the immaturity of an individual
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:33.280]  like jimacosta but also the cult mind think of this political group jimacosta winds at andrew
[1:54:33.280 --> 1:54:38.960]  yang for going on bad person tucker carlson shown that she says he's a bad person tucker carlson
[1:54:38.960 --> 1:54:44.400]  i don't i don't know anything about tucker carlson that would deem him a bad person but see andrew
[1:54:44.400 --> 1:54:51.760]  yang left the democrat party so that angers the cult when you leave the cult the cult gets mad
[1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:57.360]  and so yang left the democrat party cult and now jimacosta is seething about it the democrats
[1:54:57.360 --> 1:55:03.120]  are seething about it because they're in a cult they're now admitting what info wars actually
[1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:09.520]  reported years ago adam schiff claims robert moeller suffering from heartbreaking cognitive
[1:55:09.520 --> 1:55:15.040]  decline no folks he was already like that that's why moeller was like the president of the democrat
[1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:22.560]  party uh at the outset of the trump presidency just like biden was the or is the president now
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:28.400]  they chose a daughtering old fool that doesn't have his mental capacities or faculties to be their
[1:55:28.400 --> 1:55:33.760]  leader because it's the easiest puppet it's the manchurian candidate so with moeller then it's
[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:37.840]  biden now but now they're admitting that moeller was suffering from top cognitive decline the whole
