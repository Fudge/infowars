[00:00.000 --> 00:24.080]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:24.080 --> 00:30.080]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:30.080 --> 00:59.280]  technocracy tank goper, you're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:59.280 --> 01:03.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide on this Friday, the ninth day of
[01:03.240 --> 01:16.160]  September 2016, and of course we will also be here this Sunday live on the 15th anniversary
[01:16.160 --> 01:19.400]  of the September 11th attacks.
[01:19.400 --> 01:24.760]  So thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:24.760 --> 01:29.320]  We only have one guest lined up and that's going to be Rob Dube popping in at the bottom
[01:29.320 --> 01:40.040]  of the third hour, and we have David Knight hosting the fourth hour of Overdrive today.
[01:40.040 --> 01:45.520]  Hillary is in freefall, Hillary is crashing and burning.
[01:45.520 --> 01:51.200]  It is now evident and apparent that they have had a bunch of basically fake polls out there
[01:51.200 --> 02:00.000]  with fake data that they've been entering into them.
[02:00.000 --> 02:07.080]  And the establishment realizes that Hillary is in very, very serious trouble, and so they
[02:07.080 --> 02:12.040]  are panicking right now trying to figure out what to do, because all they care about is
[02:12.040 --> 02:17.480]  getting her into office so they can get their next puppet in, Mr. Cain, to cover up for
[02:17.480 --> 02:21.100]  all the previous crimes that the globalists have committed and to continue the ongoing
[02:21.100 --> 02:26.860]  corporate hostile takeover of this republic.
[02:26.860 --> 02:32.520]  But because globalism has been exposed all across the world, it is in basic retreat right
[02:32.520 --> 02:37.440]  now, and opposition is only mounting.
[02:37.440 --> 02:43.400]  The problem is they are brazenly only intensifying their operations despite being defeated.
[02:43.400 --> 02:48.360]  And I call this the Hitler Effect, where Hitler didn't give up, as everyone knows, until he
[02:48.360 --> 02:51.960]  was pinned down in Berlin in that bunker.
[02:51.960 --> 02:57.520]  They have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, I mean, I can't even keep track
[02:57.520 --> 02:58.520]  of them, hundreds.
[02:58.520 --> 03:06.000]  You can just put in Alex Jones, Hillary Clinton, and you'll get hundreds of articles a day
[03:06.000 --> 03:12.080]  just spewing the most incredible twisted disinformation you can imagine, and they just keep panicking.
[03:12.080 --> 03:14.920]  But I'm only keeping track of the ones attacking me.
[03:14.920 --> 03:26.800]  But it's Julian Assange, Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, triangle
[03:26.800 --> 03:31.760]  of conspiracy.
[03:31.760 --> 03:36.760]  Really is ridiculous to see all this going on.
[03:36.760 --> 03:39.120]  The whole world is against the Bushes and the Clintons.
[03:39.120 --> 03:41.680]  The whole world knows America's been hijacked by criminals.
[03:41.680 --> 03:47.520]  The whole world is sick and tired of watching our government finance and fund Al Qaeda and
[03:47.520 --> 03:49.600]  ISIS and all these other criminal groups.
[03:49.600 --> 03:57.680]  The whole world knows that America is in the hands of very, very wicked evil people.
[03:57.680 --> 04:03.040]  And the other side thinks they can just spew talking points in rhetoric and call us evil
[04:03.040 --> 04:06.160]  and call us bad.
[04:06.160 --> 04:09.680]  When the facts are Alex Jones didn't run in the country, Matt Drudge isn't running
[04:09.680 --> 04:12.960]  in the country, and Donald Trump isn't running in the country yet.
[04:12.960 --> 04:15.560]  And boy, even if he gets into office, the opposition he's going to face is going to
[04:15.560 --> 04:16.800]  be enormous.
[04:16.800 --> 04:22.040]  But it's all a signpost showing that we're trying to turn the ship around from certain
[04:22.040 --> 04:23.760]  doom.
[04:23.760 --> 04:26.200]  So this is the animating context of liberty.
[04:26.200 --> 04:29.600]  We're going to come back and just get into all of it.
[04:29.600 --> 04:33.160]  One of our reporters, auxiliary reporters, I've been doing reporting for us off and on
[04:33.160 --> 04:41.600]  for years, got footage of Hillary not being able to come out of a medical tent and having
[04:41.600 --> 04:49.080]  this gurney, this stretcher with emergency personnel in body armor with ambulances and
[04:49.080 --> 04:51.160]  the rest of it.
[04:51.160 --> 04:55.320]  And we started covering this a few days ago, but we missed the farce for the trees.
[04:55.320 --> 04:57.200]  It's an even bigger story in it.
[04:57.200 --> 04:59.200]  Stay with us.
[04:59.200 --> 05:07.440]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com, PR Newswire, Hillary's health concerns serious, say most
[05:07.440 --> 05:12.400]  doctors pulled by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.
[05:12.400 --> 05:16.440]  Concerns about Hillary Clinton's health are serious, could be disqualifying for the position
[05:16.440 --> 05:23.000]  of President of the US, says nearly 71% of 250 physicians responding to an informal internet
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.800]  survey by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.
[05:26.800 --> 05:32.520]  About 20% said concerns were likely overblown, but should be addressed as by full release
[05:32.520 --> 05:34.200]  of medical records.
[05:34.200 --> 05:38.520]  Only 2.7% responded that they were just a political attack.
[05:38.520 --> 05:43.720]  While more than 81% were aware of her history of a concussion, only 59% were aware of the
[05:43.720 --> 05:49.840]  cerebral sinus thrombosis and 52% of the history of deep venous thrombosis.
[05:49.840 --> 05:54.280]  Obviously, there's something going on with Hillary's health and it's not sexist to question
[05:54.280 --> 05:55.280]  it.
[05:55.280 --> 05:57.600]  There are other reports like this at infowars.com.
[05:57.600 --> 06:07.000]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say, take the 12-actin-2 Supermale Brain Forged Prostigar
[06:07.000 --> 06:08.000]  Silver Bullet.
[06:08.000 --> 06:09.000]  I use them all.
[06:09.000 --> 06:10.000]  They're phenomenal.
[06:10.000 --> 06:11.000]  They work.
[06:11.000 --> 06:12.000]  Buy info.
[06:12.000 --> 06:13.000]  Thank you, brother.
[06:13.000 --> 06:14.000]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[06:14.000 --> 06:20.000]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[06:20.000 --> 06:21.000]  Um, I have one.
[06:21.000 --> 06:22.000]  I have one.
[06:22.000 --> 06:26.760]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the info war
[06:26.760 --> 06:27.760]  at the same time.
[06:27.760 --> 06:28.760]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[06:28.760 --> 06:55.760]  I'm a nine-year listener and I'm a nine-year listener and I'm a nine-year listener.
[06:55.760 --> 07:05.600]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[07:05.600 --> 07:10.960]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war, a 360 win.
[07:10.960 --> 07:15.920]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[07:15.920 --> 07:17.520]  at infowarsore.com.
[07:17.520 --> 07:21.320]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[07:21.320 --> 07:25.440]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[07:25.440 --> 07:30.680]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[07:30.680 --> 07:34.760]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[07:34.760 --> 07:36.560]  the products that you need each month.
[07:36.560 --> 07:41.160]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and
[07:41.160 --> 07:44.280]  choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[07:44.280 --> 07:49.600]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[07:49.600 --> 07:51.000]  this is a sure win.
[07:51.000 --> 07:52.560]  10% off on auto ship.
[07:52.560 --> 07:58.400]  Win win win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50 and all out of stock items
[07:58.400 --> 08:11.560]  are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[08:11.560 --> 08:15.600]  We now take you live.
[08:15.600 --> 08:22.440]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the resistance.
[08:22.440 --> 08:29.440]  This is Alex Jones.
[08:29.440 --> 08:38.920]  Just keep it coming.
[08:38.920 --> 08:48.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is the ninth day of September, 2016 on this Friday global broadcast.
[08:48.280 --> 08:54.880]  I'm your host Alex Jones and you need to get strapped in.
[08:54.880 --> 09:07.080]  Turns out that our particular paradigm analysis of the globalist is super on target, but only
[09:07.080 --> 09:09.400]  to one level.
[09:09.400 --> 09:12.880]  We're now getting deeper into the rabbit hole and now getting new approximations of the
[09:12.880 --> 09:17.040]  new world order operation and let me tell you, it gets crazier by the minute.
[09:17.040 --> 09:26.080]  These people are lunatics, but they got a plan and if we know the plan and we educate
[09:26.080 --> 09:32.120]  the public that the plan is anti-human, humanity will do the rest.
[09:32.120 --> 09:36.720]  It may look like globalism is unstoppable, the technocracy is undefeatable, their system
[09:36.720 --> 09:43.440]  is all going into place, but the minute humanity turns against it and rejects it, there's seven
[09:43.440 --> 09:52.720]  and a half billion of us, we will revolutionize the world overnight because the best laid
[09:52.720 --> 09:58.320]  plans of mice and men often go astray.
[09:58.320 --> 10:07.200]  The globalist biggest fault in their operations is that they do not promote the best and the
[10:07.200 --> 10:11.960]  brightest even in their own guild now, they do it via seniority like it's North Korea
[10:11.960 --> 10:18.040]  or something and that's why North Korea supplies us with an endless stream of very, very wicked
[10:18.040 --> 10:22.560]  satire, very, very twisted satire because it is so disconnected.
[10:22.560 --> 10:28.960]  They can't manufacture an automobile, they can't basically invent any technology, they
[10:28.960 --> 10:37.120]  have nothing and they have a toddling third generation hereditary dictator who executes
[10:37.120 --> 10:44.840]  members of his family if during 18-hour government events they look like they nod off for 30
[10:44.840 --> 10:45.840]  seconds.
[10:45.840 --> 10:51.520]  What a wonderful world to live in, North Korea bans sarcasm because Kim Jong-un fears
[10:51.520 --> 10:56.520]  people only agree with him ironically.
[10:56.520 --> 11:01.600]  So schizophrenic, so mentally ill, you can just document Kim, I could show TV viewers
[11:01.600 --> 11:06.920]  this article, it's all independent and it's the generals all running around worshiping
[11:06.920 --> 11:08.980]  him like he's a god.
[11:08.980 --> 11:16.240]  Talk about total fruitcake delusional behavior, I mean it's a joke but that's big government
[11:16.240 --> 11:28.280]  for you, that's hereditary power for you, that's passing the reins on to your minions and that's
[11:28.280 --> 11:32.960]  what we see with Hillary Clinton, the same stumbling around, the same sycophantic behavior,
[11:32.960 --> 11:41.960]  the same worship behavior from her aides, she is emblematic of this rotting facade preparing
[11:41.960 --> 11:43.320]  to collapse in on itself.
[11:43.320 --> 11:52.920]  Now let's talk about that rotting facade.
[11:52.920 --> 11:57.960]  Donald Trump has come out and said, quote, Hillary Clinton is running a global criminal
[11:57.960 --> 12:01.360]  enterprise and spreading terrorism.
[12:01.360 --> 12:04.920]  Her words about Hillary Clinton have never been said.
[12:04.920 --> 12:12.520]  She does run a large global criminal enterprise, she is the progenitor or the fount, the fountain
[12:12.520 --> 12:22.560]  head, the source, with George Soros and a few others, they're the top captains.
[12:22.560 --> 12:27.840]  We're not quite sure who the head general is but we know who runs the show, they brag
[12:27.840 --> 12:32.120]  about it.
[12:32.120 --> 12:40.640]  We don't know who the king of the ring race are but we know who they are and she thinks
[12:40.640 --> 12:45.840]  we're so stupid that she's been arming and running al-Qaeda and ISIS for at least six
[12:45.840 --> 12:53.120]  years, seven years now, starting with the situation we saw in Libya and now obviously
[12:53.120 --> 12:58.120]  in Syria and 20-something other countries, this is an alliance the globalists have with
[12:58.120 --> 13:02.320]  the Saudi Arabians to spread their brand of Islam.
[13:02.320 --> 13:08.520]  By the way, their brand of Islam is winning, 80% of the world are Sunnis and the Wahhabi
[13:08.520 --> 13:14.480]  sect out of Saudi Arabia that controls Mecca is now basically enforcing that and we're
[13:14.480 --> 13:18.000]  seeing more persecution of Sunnis at the hands of Sunnis than probably anybody else.
[13:18.000 --> 13:24.000]  It is a nightmare scenario, a nightmare scenario on so many fronts.
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.080]  We're going to be getting to that clip coming up but Hillary running global criminal enterprise
[13:29.080 --> 13:33.880]  and spreading terrorism, GOP nominee says he would prevent a 9-11.
[13:33.880 --> 13:36.800]  Yeah, it wouldn't have been hard to do if they were ordered to stand down but a minimum
[13:36.800 --> 13:41.120]  that's been declassified.
[13:41.120 --> 13:50.600]  Getting into her health, this is from the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons,
[13:50.600 --> 13:55.560]  that's the second largest group in the country, Hillary's health concerns serious, say most
[13:55.560 --> 14:02.080]  doctors pulled by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, 71% of doctors say
[14:02.080 --> 14:06.360]  Hillary's health concerns are real, serious and could be disqualifying.
[14:06.360 --> 14:15.120]  Yeah, Dr. Drew, he was an anti-Hillar, he just got asked about on a radio show, also
[14:15.120 --> 14:21.440]  at a CNN show for five, six years, got canceled a week after he said just the drugs she's
[14:21.440 --> 14:26.520]  taking and the medical records she released, it was just crazy.
[14:26.520 --> 14:31.120]  I mean, I want to talk to her doctors, I want to talk to her, this is dangerous.
[14:31.120 --> 14:37.080]  Well, how dare you say as a talk show host and as a board certified board examining,
[14:37.080 --> 14:42.600]  on the board of examiners, a doctor's doctor, who has expertise in this very field, a leading
[14:42.600 --> 14:52.400]  expert, how dare you on a radio show in America talk about the witch king, Hillary Clinton.
[14:52.400 --> 14:53.400]  You just do not do it.
[14:53.400 --> 15:01.120]  Again, that's the press climate in this country, people, and that's why there were hundreds
[15:01.120 --> 15:02.120]  and hundreds and hundreds.
[15:02.120 --> 15:03.280]  I mean, I can't count them all up.
[15:03.280 --> 15:09.520]  I typed in Alex Jones, Hillary Clinton earpiece, and there were over a thousand articles that
[15:09.520 --> 15:10.520]  popped up.
[15:10.520 --> 15:15.640]  I just looked at 10 or so this morning and they had the Chicago Tribune saying that
[15:15.640 --> 15:22.400]  I'm this wicked, evil, dark, horrible devil and then I'm just so horrible and then I must
[15:22.400 --> 15:28.520]  be stopped and how dare Donald Trump Jr. tweet out our story and how evil Matt Drudge is
[15:28.520 --> 15:31.280]  and blah, blah, blah, and how could we question her?
[15:31.280 --> 15:33.400]  This is just the most outrageous thing ever.
[15:33.400 --> 15:37.960]  I'm just picking this article because it was just one of the ones I looked at because
[15:37.960 --> 15:42.800]  it's all nothing but talking points they've put out regurgitated by this guy.
[15:42.800 --> 15:46.080]  And it sounds like a desperate nine-year-old wrote it.
[15:46.080 --> 15:51.560]  So I'm going to ask Rex, whatever his name is, we'll put it back on screen, to come on
[15:51.560 --> 15:56.680]  the broadcast, Rex Humkey.
[15:56.680 --> 15:57.680]  I love it.
[15:57.680 --> 15:58.680]  Important thoughts from my fingers.
[15:58.680 --> 16:03.200]  Yeah, I guess your fingers don't have a lot of brain cells in them, buddy, because you
[16:03.200 --> 16:08.240]  read this and it's just total panic saying, normal people don't listen to Alex Jones.
[16:08.240 --> 16:09.240]  It's dangerous.
[16:09.240 --> 16:10.240]  Don't listen.
[16:10.240 --> 16:11.240]  He's bad.
[16:11.240 --> 16:12.240]  Oh my God.
[16:12.240 --> 16:13.240]  This is insane.
[16:13.240 --> 16:14.240]  What's going on?
[16:14.240 --> 16:18.160]  When all he said was, is she wearing an earpiece?
[16:18.160 --> 16:19.440]  It looks like she's wearing an earpiece.
[16:19.440 --> 16:22.480]  There have been many controversies before about earpieces.
[16:22.480 --> 16:25.000]  George W. was clearly wearing one in some of the debates.
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.040]  We covered it then.
[16:27.040 --> 16:29.000]  This woman's a known liar.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.120]  She's been caught lying over and over again.
[16:31.120 --> 16:34.000]  She's been involved in so many scams, it's a joke.
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.120]  She was representing the Chinese president secretly for money.
[16:37.120 --> 16:38.360]  That's in the New WikiLeaks.
[16:38.360 --> 16:43.160]  A true liberal, Julian Assange, that exposed Bush and the globalist, the neocons, says
[16:43.160 --> 16:49.240]  Hillary is far worse and quote, a demon, and is creating a demon climate to persecute
[16:49.240 --> 16:52.800]  the press and quote, put all of our necks in a noose.
[16:52.800 --> 16:56.440]  That's because he's got tens of thousands of pages more.
[16:56.440 --> 17:00.640]  He's releasing next week and tens of thousands after that, so much stuff it'll make your
[17:00.640 --> 17:03.360]  head spin of the horrible things she's doing.
[17:03.360 --> 17:07.520]  And as a real liberal, he is exposing her.
[17:07.520 --> 17:12.840]  I even saw clips of Ed Schultz basically coming out against Hillary now and saying she's
[17:12.840 --> 17:14.360]  a criminal.
[17:14.360 --> 17:23.440]  So this whole thing is imploding, this whole thing is imploding fast.
[17:23.440 --> 17:29.400]  So running back through these, you've got 71% of one of the biggest medical associations
[17:29.400 --> 17:35.160]  in the country being polled, we have 100% being polled, 71% of those polled saying that
[17:35.160 --> 17:39.440]  Hillary Clinton has serious health problems obviously on its face.
[17:39.440 --> 17:42.280]  Now they can call me a conspiracy theorist and say I'm evil all day and the rest of
[17:42.280 --> 17:43.280]  it.
[17:43.280 --> 17:48.320]  But WikiLeaks has her trying to get Parkinson's medication.
[17:48.320 --> 17:52.320]  And then WikiLeaks has Uma Abedin saying oh did you forget your earpiece so I need
[17:52.320 --> 17:53.680]  to bring it.
[17:53.680 --> 17:56.680]  So might have been a hearing aid, looks like a hearing aid to me.
[17:56.680 --> 18:03.160]  The point is that they put out a few shots with her ear in shadow photos in Newsweek,
[18:03.160 --> 18:04.160]  you name it.
[18:04.160 --> 18:07.960]  I mean when I say hundreds, it's probably thousands of articles, I mean you can't keep
[18:07.960 --> 18:15.800]  track of them, it says thousands and saying oh we're debunked, no you're debunked.
[18:15.800 --> 18:20.760]  We asked a question about a known liar, James Woods asked the question, we simply picked
[18:20.760 --> 18:25.280]  it up and gave people an opportunity to look at it, became the number one story yesterday
[18:25.280 --> 18:29.480]  thanks to dredgerport.com and the listeners of the show and others spreading it.
[18:29.480 --> 18:31.240]  And so then they attempt to act like there's no problem.
[18:31.240 --> 18:41.320]  Well let me tell you, we have what I would call just the added gravy to all of this because
[18:41.320 --> 18:46.040]  you add all of this together with this new story I've got when we come back after break
[18:46.040 --> 18:57.320]  that is from our own reporter in Ohio breaking down the fact that they have these ambulances
[18:57.320 --> 19:02.000]  when Hillary is traveling around and that Hillary couldn't come out of a tent and spoke
[19:02.000 --> 19:06.440]  basically 45 minutes late, she's in the tent, they've got an ambulance, they've got people
[19:06.440 --> 19:11.400]  running around with stretchers into the tent where she is, the air conditioned tent, they've
[19:11.400 --> 19:21.720]  got body armor on, it's secret service with EMS outfits on and they're going into the
[19:21.720 --> 19:27.640]  tent and this should be investigated massively, I mean they've got a guy running around behind
[19:27.640 --> 19:31.520]  Hillary with an injector pin, whenever she gets asked questions she freaks out and the
[19:31.520 --> 19:35.080]  guy goes it's okay, it's okay, keep talking and people are going oh it's preposterous
[19:35.080 --> 19:40.000]  that Hillary wouldn't need an earpiece, she's her own woman, she used to be really smart,
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.640]  the woman is a bumbling moron now half the time, she's obviously breaking down, she
[19:44.640 --> 19:49.120]  looks completely drugged out and insane and now they're running around with her in tents
[19:49.120 --> 19:56.440]  with huge medical gurneys with guys in body armor, what in the world is going on here?
[19:56.440 --> 20:25.960]  This needs to be looked at, this is a big story with video on info wars dot com.
[20:25.960 --> 20:31.600]  Like ad armor dot com, that's cati armor dot com, comment, take it.
[20:31.600 --> 20:36.840]  Fully cooked ready to eat bacon, I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon,
[20:36.840 --> 20:41.720]  savory and delicious, I buy some, I use some, I store some, awesome.

[20:51.800 --> 20:55.800]  life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon, 10-year shelf life bacon,
[20:55.800 --> 21:00.800]  ships free at fullycookedbacon.com, fullycookedbacon.com.
[21:00.800 --> 21:04.800]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality,
[21:04.800 --> 21:06.800]  feeling better than you have in years,
[21:06.800 --> 21:08.800]  and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns,
[21:08.800 --> 21:11.800]  blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[21:11.800 --> 21:14.800]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives,
[21:14.800 --> 21:15.800]  and you could be one of them.
[21:15.800 --> 21:17.800]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[21:17.800 --> 21:20.800]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract,
[21:20.800 --> 21:23.800]  talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[21:23.800 --> 21:26.800]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract
[21:26.800 --> 21:29.800]  is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals,
[21:29.800 --> 21:31.800]  amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients
[21:31.800 --> 21:33.800]  so the body will heal itself.
[21:33.800 --> 21:36.800]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure,
[21:36.800 --> 21:39.800]  balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[21:39.800 --> 21:43.800]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetic.
[21:43.800 --> 21:45.800]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[21:45.800 --> 21:48.800]  It simply needs some help, so it has the tools to heal itself.
[21:48.800 --> 21:50.800]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[22:35.800 --> 22:39.800]  associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[24:25.800 --> 24:30.800]  All right, my friends, I want to show you a headline
[24:30.800 --> 24:33.800]  before I get back into all the huge election news,
[24:33.800 --> 24:36.800]  Hillary crashing and burning information.
[24:36.800 --> 24:39.800]  There's just so much today to go over, so many important clips.
[24:39.800 --> 24:44.800]  I want to just take you back to an article out of the UK Sun just two days ago
[24:44.800 --> 24:48.800]  that I read the headline of but never even covered.
[24:48.800 --> 24:53.800]  And it's over a 20 page article with all these top scientists,
[24:53.800 --> 25:00.800]  all these top historians, sociologists, psychologists, military experts.
[25:00.800 --> 25:04.800]  By the way, our Pentagon concurs with these reports,
[25:04.800 --> 25:07.800]  saying the planet is closer to catastrophic World War III
[25:07.800 --> 25:10.800]  than at any time for 60 years, experts warn,
[25:10.800 --> 25:13.800]  and it doesn't look good for Britain or America if it does kick off.
[25:13.800 --> 25:16.800]  And this is a big detailed report, this excellent,
[25:16.800 --> 25:20.800]  that I want to go over and probably shoot a special report next week on
[25:20.800 --> 25:24.800]  and get some of these guests on, just to look at all the trigger points
[25:24.800 --> 25:28.800]  and the things that are expanding and happening around the planet,
[25:28.800 --> 25:37.800]  because we do our research here, but it's good to see it in a big detailed report like this.
[25:37.800 --> 25:42.800]  And some people will say, well, we haven't had a nuclear war yet,
[25:42.800 --> 25:45.800]  so what's the problem?
[25:45.800 --> 25:49.800]  Well, the problem is it's like having, say, a 65 year old building.
[25:49.800 --> 25:52.800]  That's how long we've had, you know, the modern atomic age.
[25:52.800 --> 25:55.800]  And we haven't had a big fire yet.
[25:55.800 --> 25:58.800]  Well, statistics show the longer the building's there,
[25:58.800 --> 26:02.800]  the better a chance it's going to end up having a fire,
[26:02.800 --> 26:05.800]  just because of time going by.
[26:05.800 --> 26:09.800]  And statistically, there's a better chance over a long period of time.
[26:09.800 --> 26:11.800]  Let's say there's an oak tree that's 300 years old.
[26:11.800 --> 26:14.800]  Does it have a better chance or a worse chance of being struck by lightning?
[26:14.800 --> 26:19.800]  In the aggregate, it has a better chance of being struck by lightning.
[26:19.800 --> 26:23.800]  The older it is, because it's more time.
[26:23.800 --> 26:24.800]  Same thing.
[26:24.800 --> 26:30.800]  And you look at all this, the world is getting more dangerous,
[26:30.800 --> 26:35.800]  not less dangerous.
[26:35.800 --> 26:40.800]  And it's frustrating to me, very, very, very, very frustrating to me
[26:40.800 --> 26:45.800]  to sit here and to see this happening and to really be concerned about my family.
[26:45.800 --> 26:49.800]  And to see so many Americans and so many other people that just don't have any concern
[26:49.800 --> 26:52.800]  and think nuclear war is a conspiracy theory.
[26:52.800 --> 26:55.800]  The truth is we've already had nuclear wars.
[26:55.800 --> 26:59.800]  Depleted uranium was used in the first Gulf War and the second Gulf War,
[26:59.800 --> 27:01.800]  and now it's being used all over the world.
[27:01.800 --> 27:03.800]  And it is radioactive.
[27:03.800 --> 27:06.800]  And inside the body, it goes into the cells at point blank range.
[27:06.800 --> 27:12.800]  And even though it's low-level radiation, it cooks them at point blank range.
[27:12.800 --> 27:17.800]  And cancers have exploded in the troops, the deformities.
[27:17.800 --> 27:18.800]  It's well documented.
[27:18.800 --> 27:20.800]  I don't need to go into that.
[27:20.800 --> 27:21.800]  Everybody knows that.
[27:21.800 --> 27:27.800]  And now we've got 440-something power-producing nuclear reactors
[27:27.800 --> 27:32.800]  and hundreds and hundreds, several hundred other research reactors.
[27:32.800 --> 27:36.800]  And I go to the Department of Energy's own website and you can also go to
[27:36.800 --> 27:38.800]  the International Atomic Energy Agency website.
[27:38.800 --> 27:41.800]  And it doesn't even list two nuclear reactors that are in Austin.
[27:41.800 --> 27:46.800]  So when I say there's 700 reactors, that's not counting submarines,
[27:46.800 --> 27:48.800]  add 300, 400 more onto that.
[27:48.800 --> 27:50.800]  Who knows how many reactors?
[27:50.800 --> 27:51.800]  A thousand?
[27:51.800 --> 27:52.800]  Two thousand?
[27:52.800 --> 27:54.800]  Who knows?
[27:54.800 --> 27:56.800]  And here's the difference.
[27:56.800 --> 27:59.800]  They're supposed to shut these plants down after 30, 40 years.
[27:59.800 --> 28:00.800]  They're not shutting them down.
[28:00.800 --> 28:02.800]  And they just don't even seem to care now.
[28:02.800 --> 28:05.800]  They're turning the alarms off all over the country
[28:05.800 --> 28:09.800]  so that when they leak radiation by law, the alarms would go off.
[28:09.800 --> 28:10.800]  That scares the public.
[28:10.800 --> 28:13.800]  So now they just turn the alarms off.
[28:13.800 --> 28:16.800]  So, bottom line, September is prepared this month.
[28:16.800 --> 28:18.800]  Everybody needs to get prepared.
[28:18.800 --> 28:20.800]  That way it's a win-win of bad things don't happen
[28:20.800 --> 28:23.800]  and there isn't economic crisis or there aren't larger wars or whatever.
[28:23.800 --> 28:25.800]  Hey, you got insurance you can eat.
[28:25.800 --> 28:26.800]  High-quality, swarable foods.
[28:26.800 --> 28:30.800]  You're drinking water through great water purification systems already.
[28:30.800 --> 28:36.800]  Not just for a disaster, but just for the ongoing glyphosates and all the rest of the trash.
[28:36.800 --> 28:39.800]  We've got specials, the biggest we've ever run.
[28:39.800 --> 28:44.800]  30 to 40% off on swarable foods, super high quality, totally fresh,
[28:44.800 --> 28:48.800]  last 25 years, InfoWarsStore.com.
[28:48.800 --> 28:51.800]  30 to 40% off depending on which package you get.
[28:51.800 --> 28:55.800]  Also, big discounts, 20% on water filtration systems.
[28:55.800 --> 29:00.800]  We've got the huge spectrum of non-GMO heirloom open pollinated seeds.
[29:00.800 --> 29:04.800]  We've got so many other great products like Survival Shield Nation I-9X2.
[29:04.800 --> 29:08.800]  20% off and it's going to end early next week.
[29:08.800 --> 29:10.800]  I can't keep extending the sale.
[29:10.800 --> 29:11.800]  I haven't even extended it yet.
[29:11.800 --> 29:12.800]  It's supposed to end Sunday.
[29:12.800 --> 29:15.800]  I might extend it a couple days, but that's it.
[29:15.800 --> 29:20.800]  And by the way, I'm ending next Monday the Hillary for Prison shirts at cost
[29:20.800 --> 29:24.800]  just because I wasn't thinking when I did that.
[29:24.800 --> 29:25.800]  There's actually more expense in there.
[29:25.800 --> 29:28.800]  There's the bumper stickers and citizen rule books we add in.
[29:28.800 --> 29:29.800]  I'm actually losing money on it.
[29:29.800 --> 29:30.800]  I just can't do that.
[29:30.800 --> 29:31.800]  We have to find the operations.
[29:31.800 --> 29:33.800]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[29:33.800 --> 29:37.800]  But if you want a Hillary for Prison shirt for $9.95 with a pocket constitution
[29:37.800 --> 29:41.800]  and two Hillary for Prison shirts, that's shipping included at cost.
[29:41.800 --> 29:44.800]  Get it now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[29:44.800 --> 29:49.800]  InfoWarsLife.com for the supplements or call toll 3-888-2533139.
[29:49.800 --> 29:50.800]  Stay with us.
[29:50.800 --> 29:51.800]  We're on the march.
[29:51.800 --> 29:53.800]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.800 --> 29:57.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:23.800 --> 30:27.800]  It's not all people who menstruate are women.
[30:27.800 --> 30:31.800]  There's been a lot of conversation about why pads and tampons are a necessity.
[30:31.800 --> 30:33.800]  Not a luxury, but not a lot of action.
[30:33.800 --> 30:36.800]  We wanted to take it into our own hands, says the president.
[30:36.800 --> 30:39.800]  Low-income students struggle with having the necessary funding for food,
[30:39.800 --> 30:40.800]  let alone tampons.
[30:40.800 --> 30:44.800]  By putting menstrual products in women's and men's and gender-exclusive bathrooms,
[30:44.800 --> 30:49.800]  he has set a tone of trans-inclusivity and will not forget that they're an important
[30:49.800 --> 30:50.800]  part of the population.
[30:50.800 --> 30:54.800]  But it's under no illusions that the effort will be universally popular.
[30:54.800 --> 30:57.800]  Yeah, because men don't menstruate.
[30:57.800 --> 31:00.800]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[31:00.800 --> 31:02.800]  Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[31:02.800 --> 31:03.800]  It took you over a year to do it.
[31:03.800 --> 31:04.800]  Why is this so good?
[31:04.800 --> 31:10.800]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[31:10.800 --> 31:15.800]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[31:15.800 --> 31:22.800]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[31:22.800 --> 31:23.800]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[31:23.800 --> 31:27.800]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[31:27.800 --> 31:30.800]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[31:30.800 --> 31:31.800]  These are all parasites.
[31:31.800 --> 31:34.800]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[31:34.800 --> 31:35.800]  You have the neem in there.
[31:35.800 --> 31:38.800]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[31:38.800 --> 31:41.800]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[31:41.800 --> 31:44.800]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[31:44.800 --> 31:47.800]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[31:47.800 --> 31:48.800]  And folks, you can't lose.
[31:48.800 --> 31:50.800]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[31:50.800 --> 31:54.800]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[31:54.800 --> 31:56.800]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[31:56.800 --> 32:17.800]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[32:27.800 --> 32:29.800]  It's got four and a half stars.
[32:29.800 --> 32:30.800]  People really love it.
[32:30.800 --> 32:31.800]  Read about it.
[32:31.800 --> 32:35.800]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[32:35.800 --> 32:38.800]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems
[32:38.800 --> 32:40.800]  that will blow your socks off.
[32:40.800 --> 32:42.800]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[32:42.800 --> 32:44.800]  but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[32:44.800 --> 32:48.800]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep,
[32:48.800 --> 32:50.800]  got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[32:50.800 --> 32:54.800]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products
[32:54.800 --> 32:59.800]  on infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[33:24.800 --> 33:34.800]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[33:34.800 --> 33:36.800]  in the heart of the Resistance.
[33:36.800 --> 33:39.800]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:39.800 --> 33:42.800]  All of my ancestors are alive with me now,
[33:42.800 --> 33:46.800]  in spirit, in DNA, and in this body.
[33:46.800 --> 33:48.800]  That's the magic of God's creation.
[33:48.800 --> 33:50.800]  Everything comes in threes.
[33:50.800 --> 33:58.800]  You have a spirit, you have an individual life,
[33:58.800 --> 34:08.800]  and then you have the genetic collective of the entity you are.
[34:08.800 --> 34:10.800]  It's amazing.
[34:10.800 --> 34:12.800]  Beyond any science fiction you can imagine,
[34:12.800 --> 34:14.800]  and you're not going to read what you just heard in any book.
[34:14.800 --> 34:17.800]  I've studied history, I've studied epigenetics,
[34:17.800 --> 34:20.800]  I've studied wide-spectrum information,
[34:20.800 --> 34:22.800]  and let me tell you, that is what's happening.
[34:22.800 --> 34:24.800]  That's what's going on.
[34:24.800 --> 34:26.800]  And that's why the genetic assault on the planet,
[34:26.800 --> 34:32.800]  the GMO and all of it, is the most satanic thing ever conceived of.
[34:32.800 --> 34:34.800]  You know, I want to finish up with World War III news
[34:34.800 --> 34:36.800]  and then get back into the huge Hillary Medical news.
[34:36.800 --> 34:39.800]  I mean, I say huge.
[34:39.800 --> 34:44.800]  I saw this footage on, like, Tuesday
[34:44.800 --> 34:48.800]  that Millie Weaver put out with her camera crew for M4s.
[34:48.800 --> 34:50.800]  And I saw the ambulance, I thought,
[34:50.800 --> 34:52.800]  yeah, Trump doesn't have ambulances,
[34:52.800 --> 34:54.800]  and they had all these articles attacking us,
[34:54.800 --> 34:56.800]  oh, we're cooks, there's always ambulances.
[34:56.800 --> 34:58.800]  And I was like, no, that's not true,
[34:58.800 --> 35:00.800]  but Dick Cheney had ambulances, too.
[35:00.800 --> 35:02.800]  Let's just be honest, she's had serious health problems.
[35:02.800 --> 35:04.800]  It's in the WikiLeaks, it's all over the place.
[35:04.800 --> 35:06.800]  The majority of doctors that are pulled
[35:06.800 --> 35:08.800]  by procedure organizations say
[35:08.800 --> 35:10.800]  clearly something's wrong with her.
[35:10.800 --> 35:12.800]  And then, in Cleveland, Ohio,
[35:12.800 --> 35:15.800]  hiding in plain view in all this video
[35:15.800 --> 35:17.800]  is the fact that she didn't come out of the tent
[35:17.800 --> 35:20.800]  for 45 minutes or longer.
[35:20.800 --> 35:22.800]  There's an 18-minute video report
[35:22.800 --> 35:24.800]  showing all this on infowars.com.
[35:24.800 --> 35:26.800]  Chick Hillary Clinton has a rolling hospital bed
[35:26.800 --> 35:27.800]  backstage at Raleigh.
[35:27.800 --> 35:30.800]  And see, our headline isn't even strong enough.
[35:30.800 --> 35:33.800]  Hillary didn't come out till 45 minutes later.
[35:33.800 --> 35:36.800]  Hillary was in a hospital tent for 45 minutes,
[35:36.800 --> 35:39.800]  and they rolled a gurney in with guys in body armor.
[35:39.800 --> 35:42.800]  That's your headline, what the hell is going on here?
[35:46.800 --> 35:47.800]  And I have a wonderful crew.
[35:47.800 --> 35:50.800]  They're fantastic, but nine times out of 10,
[35:50.800 --> 35:52.800]  they make the same mistake I make.
[35:52.800 --> 35:55.800]  They don't go with a sensational enough headline.
[35:57.800 --> 36:00.800]  I was like, okay, ambulances, medical crews, follow Hillary.
[36:00.800 --> 36:03.800]  No, she's in a medical tent for 45 minutes,
[36:03.800 --> 36:06.800]  and they're running around all freaked out,
[36:06.800 --> 36:08.800]  like the emperor just died,
[36:08.800 --> 36:12.800]  rolling in these huge medical gurney, guys in body armor.
[36:12.800 --> 36:13.800]  She's stumbling around.
[36:13.800 --> 36:16.800]  There's a guy with an epi-pin behind her,
[36:16.800 --> 36:19.800]  a tranquilizer pin, telling her it's all right.
[36:19.800 --> 36:20.800]  She's doddering around.
[36:20.800 --> 36:25.800]  She says she wants Parkinson's medication in her own emails.
[36:25.800 --> 36:26.800]  Who am I abiding?
[36:26.800 --> 36:28.800]  She says you need your earpiece in the WikiLeaks
[36:28.800 --> 36:31.800]  when she looks like an earpiece hanging out her ear,
[36:31.800 --> 36:33.800]  and the media acts like it's kooky that we say that.
[36:33.800 --> 36:34.800]  You guys are discredited.
[36:34.800 --> 36:37.800]  You have a 6% trust rate.
[36:37.800 --> 36:42.800]  Our audience knows that we're going to tell the truth
[36:42.800 --> 36:43.800]  or die trying.
[36:43.800 --> 36:45.800]  Does that mean we don't make mistakes sometimes?
[36:45.800 --> 36:47.800]  Absolutely we do, and we correct them when we do,
[36:47.800 --> 36:51.800]  because our integrity is our number one possession.
[36:51.800 --> 36:53.800]  But we didn't say she had an earpiece.
[36:53.800 --> 36:55.800]  We said it looks like she has an earpiece.
[36:55.800 --> 36:57.800]  George W. clearly had one.
[36:57.800 --> 36:58.800]  No doubt there.
[36:58.800 --> 37:00.800]  And people said, oh, well, she's a powerful woman.
[37:00.800 --> 37:02.800]  You know, a woman can't, you know,
[37:02.800 --> 37:05.800]  answer all these complex questions without an earpiece.
[37:05.800 --> 37:08.800]  I'm saying Hillary has a handler running around with a needle
[37:08.800 --> 37:12.800]  standing, a guy has a needle standing right beside her at all times.
[37:12.800 --> 37:13.800]  She's stumbling around.
[37:13.800 --> 37:15.800]  She's completely insane.
[37:15.800 --> 37:24.800]  And the word is she's having epileptic seizures on a routine basis.
[37:24.800 --> 37:25.800]  Look, I digress.
[37:25.800 --> 37:33.800]  Let's get to the real meat and potatoes here, OK?
[37:33.800 --> 37:37.800]  Earlier this week, I mentioned an article, but never got to it.
[37:37.800 --> 37:41.800]  It's, you know, you format it 16 to 22 pages long.
[37:41.800 --> 37:45.800]  Got a lot of graphics, a lot of different generals, military experts,
[37:45.800 --> 37:51.800]  statisticians, the UN's own admission, the Pentagon's own admission,
[37:51.800 --> 37:55.800]  NATO's own admission, the Ministry of Defense's own admission out of the UK,
[37:55.800 --> 37:57.800]  saying everything I'm telling you.
[37:57.800 --> 38:01.800]  Because everything I'm telling you is already documented from them.
[38:01.800 --> 38:03.800]  And my own historical research.
[38:03.800 --> 38:07.800]  It's not like, wow, everything Alex says just keeps being dead on how he
[38:07.800 --> 38:08.800]  guessed it.
[38:08.800 --> 38:10.800]  I didn't guess it.
[38:10.800 --> 38:14.800]  In 2007, the Pentagon came out and in 2007, so did the Ministry of Defense
[38:14.800 --> 38:19.800]  and said by 2016, we will begin the global collapse through 2025.
[38:19.800 --> 38:21.800]  The chances of nuclear war will be the highest ever.
[38:21.800 --> 38:24.800]  There'll be global famines, third world populations surging over the
[38:24.800 --> 38:28.800]  borders, absolute, you know, world government.
[38:28.800 --> 38:30.800]  I mean, go read those reports.
[38:30.800 --> 38:32.800]  We've covered them at nauseam.
[38:32.800 --> 38:38.800]  So we get up here and we say, hey, governments and institutions are
[38:38.800 --> 38:39.800]  digging in.
[38:39.800 --> 38:40.800]  We better be concerned.
[38:40.800 --> 38:42.800]  We're hoping this isn't the case.
[38:42.800 --> 38:43.800]  My goodness.
[38:43.800 --> 38:45.800]  I certainly don't want all this stuff to happen.
[38:45.800 --> 38:50.800]  But there's this delusional name and claimant type culture beyond fake
[38:50.800 --> 38:57.800]  Christians or manipulated Christians where it's just trendies and everybody
[38:57.800 --> 38:59.800]  just thinks of you hope, hope, hope, everything will be okay.
[38:59.800 --> 39:03.800]  And yes, a lot of confidence in the currency and the economy is needed.
[39:03.800 --> 39:06.800]  And I'm all for confidence in the economy if it's warranted.
[39:06.800 --> 39:10.800]  But the global is doing everything they can to hurt the economy in the real
[39:10.800 --> 39:14.800]  world while telling us it's all great as they consolidate control.
[39:14.800 --> 39:16.800]  And I'm not going to go along with that line.
[39:16.800 --> 39:20.800]  So you have this headline, planet closer to catastrophic World War
[39:20.800 --> 39:23.800]  Three than any other time for 60 years, experts warn that it doesn't look
[39:23.800 --> 39:26.800]  good for Britain or America if it does kick off.
[39:26.800 --> 39:34.800]  Now, there are rules of war in history going back to the days of chivalry and
[39:34.800 --> 39:41.800]  before that where you don't target men, women and children.
[39:41.800 --> 39:43.800]  That's what a tell of the hunt does.
[39:43.800 --> 39:45.800]  That's what the Mongols do.
[39:45.800 --> 39:47.800]  That's what the barbarians do.
[39:47.800 --> 39:50.800]  You don't target women and children.
[39:50.800 --> 39:53.800]  You target fighting soldiers.
[39:53.800 --> 39:58.800]  And then all is fair in love and war.
[39:58.800 --> 40:09.800]  And even in modern American unwritten jurisprudence,
[40:09.800 --> 40:15.800]  you don't target people's families for political assassination.
[40:15.800 --> 40:19.800]  And you don't even target families, wives, daughters, sons,
[40:19.800 --> 40:21.800]  if they're not politically involved.
[40:21.800 --> 40:28.800]  You don't go after people that are not in the arena.
[40:28.800 --> 40:31.800]  And there's a good reason for that.
[40:31.800 --> 40:34.800]  You start going on people's families.
[40:34.800 --> 40:36.800]  Gloves come off real fast.
[40:36.800 --> 40:43.800]  And the veneer of civilization peels away like tiles on the bottom of a
[40:43.800 --> 40:50.800]  spacecraft coming in through the atmosphere,
[40:50.800 --> 40:53.800]  plunging into the ocean.
[40:53.800 --> 40:58.800]  But I have seen vitriol by former U.S. generals and by current NATO
[40:58.800 --> 41:00.800]  commanders, including the commander of NATO,
[41:00.800 --> 41:04.800]  and I have seen statements by former CIA directors and others
[41:04.800 --> 41:08.800]  that is the stuff of third world dictator stuff.
[41:08.800 --> 41:13.800]  In fact, it's just not done in history to shoot your mouth off about how
[41:13.800 --> 41:16.800]  you kill people and you're powerful and you're good at killing people.
[41:16.800 --> 41:18.800]  And I came and we saw he died.
[41:18.800 --> 41:21.800]  Obama, Hillary, they've all said the same amateur stuff.
[41:21.800 --> 41:24.800]  I mean, even when you've killed people with your bare hands,
[41:24.800 --> 41:27.800]  you don't talk about it, you don't brag about it,
[41:27.800 --> 41:29.800]  you don't get into it because it's bad luck.
[41:29.800 --> 41:31.800]  It's stupid.
[41:31.800 --> 41:36.800]  And it's really degrading to yourself and everybody else.
[41:36.800 --> 41:42.800]  So it's a bellwether of a society in collapse.
[41:42.800 --> 41:46.800]  And it's about the most unlucky thing in history soldiers and
[41:46.800 --> 41:49.800]  generals should be involved in.
[41:49.800 --> 41:54.800]  You added that a bunch of women in fancy $3,000, $4,000 suits with
[41:54.800 --> 41:59.800]  $100,000 diamond rings on and $100,000 necklaces.
[41:59.800 --> 42:04.800]  I mean, sexually getting excited prancing around up there and in
[42:04.800 --> 42:07.800]  back of the podium talking about we're going to bloody the Russians
[42:07.800 --> 42:08.800]  noses.
[42:08.800 --> 42:09.800]  We're going to do this.
[42:09.800 --> 42:10.800]  We're going to do that.
[42:10.800 --> 42:12.800]  Yeah, we sent $5 billion in to overthrow Ukraine.
[42:12.800 --> 42:13.800]  What's you going to do about it?
[42:13.800 --> 42:16.800]  I mean, this is the stuff of nightmares.
[42:16.800 --> 42:27.800]  I mean, this is what defeat is made of.
[42:27.800 --> 42:29.800]  And it just gets crazier from there.
[42:29.800 --> 42:34.800]  So in the last year, we have seen the head of all Russian
[42:34.800 --> 42:38.800]  intelligence agencies just die.
[42:38.800 --> 42:39.800]  They won't even say why he died.
[42:39.800 --> 42:40.800]  He just died at 56 years old.
[42:40.800 --> 42:42.800]  We can put that up on screen.
[42:42.800 --> 42:47.800]  We've seen a bunch of other Russians getting killed.
[42:47.800 --> 42:49.800]  There's a Jerusalem post.
[42:49.800 --> 42:52.800]  Russia's military intelligence chief killed in secret operation
[42:52.800 --> 42:53.800]  in Lebanon.
[42:53.800 --> 42:54.800]  That's how they spun it.
[42:54.800 --> 42:55.800]  That's not the case.
[42:55.800 --> 43:01.800]  Now, let's expand on all this.
[43:01.800 --> 43:04.800]  This is war when this type of stuff is going on.
[43:04.800 --> 43:09.800]  Now we have Vladimir Putin's favorite chauffeur killed in
[43:09.800 --> 43:13.800]  accident, exactly as former CIA director described on TV on
[43:13.800 --> 43:19.800]  Charlie Rose, where the elite go to communicate with each other.
[43:19.800 --> 43:21.800]  That's the most elite TV program there is.
[43:21.800 --> 43:26.800]  Period is Charlie Rose.
[43:26.800 --> 43:31.800]  And by the way, Charlie Rose on a wickedness scale, on an
[43:31.800 --> 43:35.800]  aristocrat scale, when I ran into him, I mean, it was
[43:35.800 --> 43:37.800]  definitely a very serious presence.
[43:37.800 --> 43:40.800]  He saw me, his eyes, his eyebrows flared.
[43:40.800 --> 43:43.800]  I like your style, Alex.
[43:43.800 --> 43:45.800]  His millions were all freaking out.
[43:45.800 --> 43:47.800]  This guy goes to Bilderberg, you name it.
[43:47.800 --> 43:49.800]  I mean, he is a piece of work.
[43:49.800 --> 43:56.800]  But that's where these guys go on these shows.
[43:56.800 --> 44:00.800]  Mike Morel, former deputy director of the CIA, salivates over
[44:00.800 --> 44:03.800]  the idea of covertly killing Russians and Iranians.
[44:03.800 --> 44:09.800]  Full conversation aired on PBS on August 8th.
[44:09.800 --> 44:11.800]  August 8th.
[44:11.800 --> 44:18.800]  And then, boom, exactly what this guy is talking about is
[44:18.800 --> 44:19.800]  going on.
[44:19.800 --> 44:23.800]  So this happens a month ago, and then a few weeks later, boom,
[44:23.800 --> 44:25.800]  the magic crash.
[44:25.800 --> 44:28.800]  One of their favorite ways to kill somebody is to have,
[44:28.800 --> 44:32.800]  obviously, a stunt driver slam into somebody and take them
[44:32.800 --> 44:35.800]  out, or they kill you, put you in a car, and then hit you with
[44:35.800 --> 44:36.800]  a truck.
[44:36.800 --> 44:39.800]  I've actually been told by security analysts and folks that
[44:39.800 --> 44:42.800]  we've had to do security checks and sweeps.
[44:42.800 --> 44:45.800]  We had to go to that level, not that I'm even scared of them
[44:45.800 --> 44:47.800]  taking me out, but I'm not going to make it easy.
[44:47.800 --> 44:49.800]  And I want to document it, too.
[44:49.800 --> 44:51.800]  So we've got a lot of counter surveillance.
[44:51.800 --> 44:54.800]  These people freak out when we actually send people to their
[44:54.800 --> 44:55.800]  house.
[44:55.800 --> 44:57.800]  It's like, oh, you're going to come to my house?
[44:57.800 --> 44:59.800]  Well, then when you go to your house in another state, we're
[44:59.800 --> 45:01.800]  going to drop by too.
[45:01.800 --> 45:03.800]  That's how that works.
[45:03.800 --> 45:07.800]  But this is how they take you out.
[45:07.800 --> 45:11.800]  I've been told this is the number one way to watch my ass at
[45:11.800 --> 45:13.800]  four-way stops at red lights, you name it.
[45:13.800 --> 45:15.800]  They'll just slam into me with a truck.
[45:15.800 --> 45:17.800]  Boom.
[45:17.800 --> 45:19.800]  And this is how they get you.
[45:19.800 --> 45:23.800]  So he called for killing, quote, everyone around Putin,
[45:23.800 --> 45:26.800]  because they had trouble getting to Putin.
[45:26.800 --> 45:28.800]  Kill everyone around Putin.
[45:28.800 --> 45:31.800]  And I could play all the clips of generals saying it's time to
[45:31.800 --> 45:33.800]  start killing Russians, kill a lot of them, body bags, blood,
[45:33.800 --> 45:34.800]  blood, blood.
[45:34.800 --> 45:36.800]  Oh, yeah, let's kill Russians on their border.
[45:36.800 --> 45:40.800]  What a wonderful idea.
[45:40.800 --> 45:43.800]  Russia has the GDP of Italy.
[45:43.800 --> 45:45.800]  Russia's trying to rebuild.
[45:45.800 --> 45:49.800]  China is the one taking the whole planet over right now.
[45:49.800 --> 45:52.800]  And the globalists are double crossing.
[45:52.800 --> 45:55.800]  Russia, they are trying to bring Russia down.
[45:55.800 --> 45:57.800]  I mean, because they see Russia as weak.
[45:57.800 --> 45:58.800]  That's what's happening.
[45:58.800 --> 46:00.800]  And then they blame Russia for everything going on in the world.
[46:00.800 --> 46:02.800]  If you oppose the globalists, the multinationals that have
[46:02.800 --> 46:05.800]  captured our country, captured Europe, captured the UK,
[46:05.800 --> 46:07.800]  they're trying to get out of it.
[46:07.800 --> 46:10.800]  They say, oh, Nigel Farage, you work for Putin.
[46:10.800 --> 46:15.800]  That's why Nigel Farage, a successful businessman, 25 years
[46:15.800 --> 46:19.800]  ago, saw the EU taking over the regulations of control in the
[46:19.800 --> 46:20.800]  UK.
[46:20.800 --> 46:22.800]  And he looked at veterans memorials of all these people that
[46:22.800 --> 46:25.800]  had died, including people in his family, a lot of military
[46:25.800 --> 46:27.800]  people in his family.
[46:27.800 --> 46:29.800]  And he got pissed off 25 years ago before Vladimir Putin was
[46:29.800 --> 46:31.800]  on the radar screen.
[46:31.800 --> 46:34.800]  He stood up for the UK sovereignty.
[46:34.800 --> 46:37.800]  And you take that away from him and the people of the UK,
[46:37.800 --> 46:43.800]  the people of England, and you say Russian agents.
[46:43.800 --> 46:47.800]  The only Russian agent business going on here is that Russia
[46:47.800 --> 46:52.800]  has been captured by the very same globalists and has gone
[46:52.800 --> 46:56.800]  through the exact same crap, but decades ago, we're starting to
[46:56.800 --> 46:57.800]  go through here.
[46:57.800 --> 47:02.800]  So they've already been raped by the same guy now raping us.
[47:02.800 --> 47:05.800]  And Russians, like, crawl the way into the shadows, finally
[47:05.800 --> 47:08.800]  throwing the rapist off and trying to nurse its wounds while
[47:08.800 --> 47:09.800]  we're getting raped.
[47:09.800 --> 47:12.800]  And the person raping us, economically, culturally, you
[47:12.800 --> 47:15.800]  name it, is telling us, by the way, while I'm raping you, go
[47:15.800 --> 47:17.800]  over there and kick Russia's ass.
[47:17.800 --> 47:19.800]  That's what's going on.
[47:19.800 --> 47:22.800]  And the whole world's saying, no, thank you.
[47:22.800 --> 47:25.800]  Donald Trump's going, what's Russia doing to us?
[47:25.800 --> 47:28.800]  China, that's what all the generals are telling him,
[47:28.800 --> 47:30.800]  because that's what's happening.
[47:30.800 --> 47:33.800]  Hillary is a Chinese agent.
[47:33.800 --> 47:35.800]  We're a joke, people.
[47:35.800 --> 47:37.800]  We've been totally taken over by foreign countries,
[47:37.800 --> 47:40.800]  foreign interests, just like Russia was taken over by the
[47:40.800 --> 47:44.800]  oligarchs.
[47:44.800 --> 47:48.800]  We could have such an amazing time of detente and in business
[47:48.800 --> 47:51.800]  and ingenuity and rebuilding the planet together if we get the
[47:51.800 --> 47:53.800]  globalist off our backs.
[47:53.800 --> 47:56.800]  And we're so close, people, but the churches have all been
[47:56.800 --> 47:59.800]  paid, all the big ones, to say it's the end of the world and
[47:59.800 --> 48:01.800]  you can't beat evil.
[48:01.800 --> 48:04.800]  So you just believe you lay down and sit there at your little
[48:04.800 --> 48:07.800]  church with your little candy-ass preacher up there who's a
[48:07.800 --> 48:12.800]  damn demon.
[48:12.800 --> 48:14.800]  Oh, I mean, there's no one more evil than the preachers that
[48:14.800 --> 48:16.800]  know full well what's going on.
[48:16.800 --> 48:18.800]  There are little homeland security badges,
[48:18.800 --> 48:20.800]  brainwashing people.
[48:20.800 --> 48:22.800]  We have state-run churches now in this country.
[48:22.800 --> 48:24.800]  It's time to end all this.
[48:24.800 --> 48:26.800]  It's time to break its back.
[48:26.800 --> 48:29.800]  It's time to stop it.
[48:29.800 --> 48:31.800]  And so this is all part of what interests us towards World War
[48:31.800 --> 48:34.800]  III, is they're saying, let's start killing Russian leaders
[48:34.800 --> 48:37.800]  and then the Russians start dying.
[48:37.800 --> 48:40.800]  And then we say, oh, do they kill the Russian head of
[48:40.800 --> 48:42.800]  security intelligence?
[48:42.800 --> 48:44.800]  Oh, do they kill his chauffeur?
[48:44.800 --> 48:46.800]  Do they kill this person?
[48:46.800 --> 48:48.800]  Do they kill that person?
[48:48.800 --> 48:50.800]  And they go, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[48:50.800 --> 48:52.800]  It doesn't work anymore.
[48:52.800 --> 48:54.800]  Let's go to this clip from Charlie Rose.
[48:54.800 --> 48:58.800]  I give them the things that they need to both go after the
[48:58.800 --> 49:02.800]  Assad government, but also to have the Iranians and the
[49:02.800 --> 49:04.800]  Russians pay a little price.
[49:04.800 --> 49:09.800]  When we were in Iraq, the Iranians were giving weapons to
[49:09.800 --> 49:13.800]  the Shia militia who were killing American soldiers.
[49:13.800 --> 49:15.800]  I mean, the Iranians were making us pay a price.
[49:15.800 --> 49:19.800]  We need to make the Iranians pay a price in Syria.
[49:19.800 --> 49:21.800]  We need to make the Russians pay a price.
[49:21.800 --> 49:22.800]  The other thing I would do-
[49:22.800 --> 49:26.800]  We make them pay the price by killing Russians and
[49:26.800 --> 49:28.800]  killing Iranians.
[49:28.800 --> 49:30.800]  Yes, covertly.
[49:30.800 --> 49:32.800]  So you don't tell the world about it, right?
[49:32.800 --> 49:34.800]  You don't stand up at the Pentagon and say we did this,
[49:34.800 --> 49:35.800]  right?
[49:35.800 --> 49:37.800]  But you make sure they know it in Moscow and Tehran.
[49:37.800 --> 49:39.800]  Here's the other thing I want to do.
[49:39.800 --> 49:40.800]  Here's the other thing I want to do.
[49:40.800 --> 49:48.800]  I want to go after those things that Assad sees as his
[49:48.800 --> 49:50.800]  personal power base, right?
[49:50.800 --> 49:52.800]  I want to scare Assad.
[49:52.800 --> 49:57.800]  So I want to go after his presidential guard.
[49:57.800 --> 50:01.800]  I want to bomb his offices in the middle of the night.
[50:01.800 --> 50:03.800]  Well, that happened about two years ago.
[50:03.800 --> 50:04.800]  You remember?
[50:04.800 --> 50:06.800]  Back it up.
[50:06.800 --> 50:09.800]  I could talk for 5,000 hours on this guy.
[50:09.800 --> 50:12.800]  The Ivy League slime a wimp.
[50:12.800 --> 50:15.800]  Talking about scaring people.
[50:15.800 --> 50:17.800]  Slimeing around.
[50:17.800 --> 50:20.800]  This is the guy that came out against Donald Trump for
[50:20.800 --> 50:21.800]  Hillary.
[50:21.800 --> 50:22.800]  A joke.
[50:22.800 --> 50:24.800]  Someone Trump said,
[50:24.800 --> 50:25.800]  I don't trust.
[50:25.800 --> 50:26.800]  I wouldn't want to talk to him.
[50:26.800 --> 50:28.800]  The general's telling me he's horrible.
[50:28.800 --> 50:31.800]  You just look at somebody like General Flynn compared to
[50:31.800 --> 50:34.800]  somebody like this little turd blossom and it's just,
[50:34.800 --> 50:36.800]  it's just honorable.
[50:36.800 --> 50:37.800]  Skip the break.
[50:37.800 --> 50:38.800]  This is too important.
[50:38.800 --> 50:39.800]  Thank you.
[50:39.800 --> 50:44.800]  Honorable, strong, a good record, patriotic, help smash
[50:44.800 --> 50:49.800]  ISIS in Al Qaeda, countermandered the CIA, got kicked out
[50:49.800 --> 50:50.800]  over it.
[50:50.800 --> 50:52.800]  They don't want to arrest him though because that soft
[50:52.800 --> 50:56.800]  coup will expose them.
[50:56.800 --> 51:01.800]  There was a soft coup in this country led informationally by
[51:01.800 --> 51:02.800]  info wars.
[51:02.800 --> 51:04.800]  And by the way, I don't say that to sound big.
[51:04.800 --> 51:05.800]  The enemy already knows it.
[51:05.800 --> 51:06.800]  You should know it.
[51:06.800 --> 51:08.800]  Okay.
[51:08.800 --> 51:10.800]  You should know it.
[51:10.800 --> 51:14.800]  We led the attack four plus years ago.
[51:14.800 --> 51:17.800]  And we had the experts on from Dr. Steve Pachennick to
[51:17.800 --> 51:23.800]  Colonel Schaefer to Tosh Plumlee to countless others.
[51:23.800 --> 51:27.800]  And they gave you the intel on the whole plan.
[51:27.800 --> 51:29.800]  And they even said they're going to flood Europe next
[51:29.800 --> 51:34.800]  with refugees before ISIS ever existed.
[51:34.800 --> 51:39.800]  Because we have patriots by and large that work in our
[51:39.800 --> 51:43.800]  government.
[51:43.800 --> 51:47.800]  And now we sit here with this guy up there going, we need to
[51:47.800 --> 51:50.800]  bomb the presidential guard, bomb their government
[51:50.800 --> 51:51.800]  buildings.
[51:51.800 --> 51:52.800]  That's what ISIS does.
[51:52.800 --> 51:53.800]  That's what Al Qaeda does.
[51:53.800 --> 51:57.800]  Same group.
[51:57.800 --> 51:59.800]  And they went and started it with a saw that was bringing the
[51:59.800 --> 52:02.800]  West in, that was transferring power, that was democratizing
[52:02.800 --> 52:04.800]  just like Muammar Gaddafi.
[52:04.800 --> 52:06.800]  They all believed Obama.
[52:06.800 --> 52:10.800]  Assad and Gaddafi believed him that it was Daytona.
[52:10.800 --> 52:11.800]  Oh, I'm liberal.
[52:11.800 --> 52:13.800]  Here, take my hand.
[52:13.800 --> 52:14.800]  Yes, let us invest.
[52:14.800 --> 52:15.800]  Bring your money in.
[52:15.800 --> 52:17.800]  And they went, okay, we don't want to fight.
[52:17.800 --> 52:20.800]  Now you could say Gaddafi fought back and done some things
[52:20.800 --> 52:22.800]  that weren't good from the West perspective.
[52:22.800 --> 52:25.800]  But Assad had done nothing.
[52:25.800 --> 52:31.800]  Medical doctor brought up in the UK.
[52:31.800 --> 52:33.800]  And they brought in Al Qaeda.
[52:33.800 --> 52:36.800]  And they killed over 200,000 Christians we know of.
[52:36.800 --> 52:39.800]  And the numbers is growing, growing, growing.
[52:39.800 --> 52:44.800]  Syria was 24%, six years ago, Christian.
[52:44.800 --> 52:46.800]  It's now like 10% or so.
[52:46.800 --> 52:48.800]  Millions have left as refugees.
[52:48.800 --> 52:51.800]  God knows where, because the West won't take Christians.
[52:51.800 --> 52:53.800]  Hundreds of thousands are dead.
[52:53.800 --> 52:59.800]  And they bring in 0.3 refugees into Europe and the US.
[52:59.800 --> 53:02.800]  The same number as a sick joke.
[53:02.800 --> 53:05.800]  You got 20-something percent that were Christian,
[53:05.800 --> 53:07.800]  but 0.3 get in.
[53:07.800 --> 53:12.800]  They let in less than 1% Shiites.
[53:12.800 --> 53:18.800]  They're almost all Wahhabist.
[53:18.800 --> 53:23.800]  And you sit back and you're looking at the former CIA deputy director,
[53:23.800 --> 53:25.800]  one of the main architects of this.
[53:25.800 --> 53:28.800]  And he sits there talking about, we want to scare people.
[53:28.800 --> 53:33.800]  Oh, like Hitler did bombing civilian targets in London.
[53:33.800 --> 53:36.800]  The British didn't even want to be in that war.
[53:36.800 --> 53:46.800]  British knew that they'd started World War I and it was wrong.
[53:46.800 --> 53:48.800]  As soon as Hitler started bombing civilian targets,
[53:48.800 --> 53:51.800]  they totally turned against him.
[53:51.800 --> 53:56.800]  And had almost 100% support, total mobilization.
[53:56.800 --> 53:59.800]  That's where you people are blind.
[53:59.800 --> 54:01.800]  You live in a world of fear.
[54:01.800 --> 54:02.800]  They're always threatening me.
[54:02.800 --> 54:03.800]  Like, oh, you threatened me.
[54:03.800 --> 54:04.800]  I'm going to shut up now.
[54:04.800 --> 54:05.800]  You mean you kill people?
[54:05.800 --> 54:06.800]  Oh, my gosh.
[54:06.800 --> 54:07.800]  I didn't know.
[54:07.800 --> 54:09.800]  I hadn't been told thousands of times.
[54:09.800 --> 54:11.800]  I hadn't been physically attacked.
[54:11.800 --> 54:12.800]  I hadn't been drugged in the mud.
[54:12.800 --> 54:13.800]  I hadn't been assaulted.
[54:13.800 --> 54:20.800]  I hadn't had all sorts of intelligence agencies jack with me.
[54:20.800 --> 54:22.800]  But it's pretty much silent now.
[54:22.800 --> 54:27.800]  We're on the other side, escaped out of your little phony fairytale.
[54:27.800 --> 54:38.800]  You guys know, short of Davey Jones' locker, I'm never stopping.
[54:38.800 --> 54:41.800]  But you notice, he sits there and he goes, we need, he's so slimy.
[54:41.800 --> 54:43.800]  We need to scare them.
[54:43.800 --> 54:45.800]  We need to kill the people around them.
[54:45.800 --> 54:46.800]  We need to kill their families.
[54:46.800 --> 54:49.800]  We need to, I mean, just the slimmiest crap on earth.
[54:49.800 --> 54:55.800]  It's just the venomous, and of course it's this little soft pseudo-intellectual, and
[54:55.800 --> 55:00.800]  they all get the fake tanks together and all glad hand each other and slap each others
[55:00.800 --> 55:05.800]  on, you know, on their butts and everything and go play golf together and suck off all
[55:05.800 --> 55:10.800]  the stolen money and just pull all this crap.
[55:10.800 --> 55:12.800]  You're not Americans.
[55:12.800 --> 55:14.800]  You hijacked this country.
[55:14.800 --> 55:17.800]  And America's never been perfect.
[55:17.800 --> 55:23.800]  But America, in the final equation, is not going to put up with your new world order
[55:23.800 --> 55:30.800]  trash, your bullying garbage, and the fact that the people running the country have never
[55:30.800 --> 55:35.800]  fought for it, never done anything, and are a bunch of weak cowards.
[55:35.800 --> 55:37.800]  You're not leaders.
[55:37.800 --> 55:40.800]  You're deceptive filth.
[55:40.800 --> 55:45.800]  And you sit there and you spew lies to the public.
[55:45.800 --> 55:50.800]  The lies of which I've never seen.
[55:50.800 --> 55:52.800]  The globalist took down Syria.
[55:52.800 --> 55:59.800]  The new world order, George Soros, Obama, Hillary, are the architects of it, the creators
[55:59.800 --> 56:07.800]  of the new al-Qaeda base in Libya to get all those weapons and to ship them in to the
[56:07.800 --> 56:08.800]  next country.
[56:08.800 --> 56:10.800]  Classic communist tactic.
[56:10.800 --> 56:16.800]  Take over one country, exploit it onto the next group.
[56:16.800 --> 56:22.800]  It's so crazy to watch Goldman Sachs and all these big banks and all these arrogant, sociopathic,
[56:22.800 --> 56:31.800]  disconnected, rich globalists with their yachts and their helicopters and all their crap destabilizing
[56:31.800 --> 56:34.800]  the world so they get total control.
[56:34.800 --> 56:39.800]  But now realizing there's such danger, they're doubling their security details and, again,
[56:39.800 --> 56:42.800]  building armored fortresses in the middle of the South Pacific.
[56:42.800 --> 56:44.800]  Oh, what a great plan you did.
[56:44.800 --> 56:45.800]  Yet again.
[56:45.800 --> 56:46.800]  Wonderful.
[56:46.800 --> 56:51.800]  You convinced yourself of your own bull.
[56:51.800 --> 56:56.800]  And now you're killing people in Russia.
[56:56.800 --> 56:58.800]  And you're bragging about it.
[56:58.800 --> 57:01.800]  I can play the generals on Fox News like it's tough.
[57:01.800 --> 57:04.800]  It's just time to start killing a bunch of Russians in Ukraine.
[57:04.800 --> 57:05.800]  That'll teach them.
[57:05.800 --> 57:08.800]  Yeah, that'll really teach them to just start killing people.
[57:08.800 --> 57:10.800]  This isn't the Iraqis.
[57:10.800 --> 57:18.800]  And I love how he sits there and implies, oh, we had to go to Iraq and the Iranians did stuff to us in Iraq.
[57:18.800 --> 57:20.800]  What?
[57:20.800 --> 57:23.800]  We blamed Iraq for what Saudi Arabia was involved in.
[57:23.800 --> 57:25.800]  That was all part of the Wahhabist plan.
[57:25.800 --> 57:26.800]  Wahhabist carry it out.
[57:26.800 --> 57:28.800]  Wahhabist enemy gets blamed.
[57:28.800 --> 57:30.800]  It's all lies.
[57:30.800 --> 57:36.800]  Shitting there like a little snake spewing this BS, hoping the viewers don't know who the players are.
[57:36.800 --> 57:39.800]  And hey, Sally soccer mom might not know.
[57:39.800 --> 57:41.800]  Billy Bob dumb ass may not know.
[57:41.800 --> 57:44.800]  Do you know all the military knows?
[57:44.800 --> 57:45.800]  They know who the players are.
[57:45.800 --> 57:49.800]  They know how the cow ate the cabbage dumbo.
[57:49.800 --> 57:54.800]  And I don't think you're going to have the robots in place.
[57:54.800 --> 57:59.800]  And the troops spiked in time.
[57:59.800 --> 58:05.800]  Because we didn't just sit here on our butts while little Ivy League tough guys like you ran around trying to kill them.
[58:05.800 --> 58:07.800]  You ran around trying to scare people.
[58:07.800 --> 58:08.800]  You didn't scare us.
[58:08.800 --> 58:09.800]  You mobilized us.
[58:09.800 --> 58:11.800]  The whole world dumb ass.
[58:11.800 --> 58:14.800]  And you're going to be held accountable.
[58:14.800 --> 58:15.800]  Make no mistake.
[58:15.800 --> 58:19.800]  Now I need this operation energized to the next level.
[58:19.800 --> 58:24.800]  I need you to spread the word, the articles, the videos all up to the four corners of the planet every hour.
[58:24.800 --> 58:30.800]  I need you to pray for us and set your will against the globalist and set your will in support of them for the wars.
[58:30.800 --> 58:38.800]  I pray to God and to take advantage of the massive sales we've got going on preparedness items in case we lose the first phase of this.
[58:38.800 --> 58:41.800]  We've got to be prepared for it to dig in.
[58:41.800 --> 58:42.800]  Stay with us.

[59:52.800 --> 59:55.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:55.800 --> 01:00:02.800]  Just what I need is a big ol' resistance to tyrants and waterpedians to God.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.800]  For the souls.
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.800]  That'd be Merle Hacker.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:25.800]  God bless him.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:43.800]  Desert's quiet.
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:52.800]  I knew what the Chicago Tribune rider would do before I ever sent an email an hour ago.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:57.800]  I knew what he'd do.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:05.800]  And my feelings aren't hurt that he dissed us because he's so powerful.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:21.800]  I'm sad because I knew that this random individual who I picked this morning to illustrate something to the viewers and listeners would be this little cowardly slimeball that I thought he was.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:31.800]  I've had more than 20 major publications just in the last month or so want to do major profiles and come down here to Austin, Texas.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.800]  And I've told him, no, I'm not doing it.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.800]  Go make up whatever you want.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:45.800]  I know you just want to interview me so that you can then act like you were actually a journalist and act like there's credibility to what you did.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.800]  You're trying to ride a road map to attack Alex Jones.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.800]  I've been down this road.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.800]  I don't care.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.800]  I'm in hundreds of articles a day, thousands a week.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.800]  What do I care about you?
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:55.800]  Okay.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:02.800]  Now, I said, if you want to do a live debate on air with me.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.800]  I mean, I was thinking about getting like the London Guardian, the New York Times and the New Yorker magazine, everybody else here.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.800]  And I'm just all right here debating me live on air.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.800]  That could be their interview.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.800]  And they said, no, no, no, we want to go to dinner with you and we want access to your family.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.800]  Oh, yeah, I've heard it all before.
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.800]  Good luck.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.800]  That said, though, you get these little egomaniacs that nobody knows who they are.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:25.800]  Like this wreck, wreck's cupcake guy.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:33.800]  And I just saw literally said, Google said there were thousands of articles today with the name Alex Jones, Hillary Clinton in it.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.800]  But hundreds and hundreds, specifically on the earpiece.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.800]  And look, James Woods pointed out, looks like an earpiece.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.800]  Bush was clearly wearing one.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.800]  We're saying, is she wearing an earpiece?
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.800]  I mean, this is a known liar, both in all sorts of stuff.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.800]  She's got secret service people beside her doctors.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.800]  You're saying it's okay.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.800]  It's okay with somebody asking a question.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.800]  She's clearly got mental problems.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.800]  So he comes out with a column, Trump and the mainstreaming of dark craziness.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:58.800]  So I send them an email.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.800]  I'm going to show TV viewers the email.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.800]  I say, good morning, Mr. Hupke.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:09.800]  And then I transcribed this, I mean, Nico transcribed it, a voice memo, but Senate.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.800]  Alex read your recent column, Trump and the mainstreaming of dark crazies.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:24.800]  And obviously disagrees with your perspective, but he welcomes the criticism would like to invite you on a show to speak on one-on-one with him about your perception of info wars.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.800]  This year's election and anything else on your radar.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:35.800]  He picked your column at random out of numerous articles written about him and would like to invite you on to defend your ideas and have a serious discussion with him.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.800]  What I'm going to start doing is every day we're going to pick one of these people.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.800]  People ask if it's a criticism.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.800]  Why don't you have opposition on?
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:49.800]  Why don't you have people opposing views can't handle it?
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:56.800]  They will not come on none of them because they all just get talking points and regurgitate it over and over and over again.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:04.800]  And you read the article, he wrote it's all whatever the PR boss of Hillary wrote weeks ago that she put out in that.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.800]  Alt conservative speech.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:13.800]  I mean, it's written like a seventh grader was talking about some evil monster.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.800]  It saw under the bed or something.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.800]  Okay.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:21.800]  And so he comes back with ha, that's all these narcissists have.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.800]  Ha.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.800]  A serious discussion.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.800]  That's a good one.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:30.800]  Well, you will say whatever you want to dumbass.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:37.800]  I do have some thoughts on how the Obama administration use fluoride in my toothpaste to turn me into a mindless lib zombie.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:41.800]  Well, I mean, Harvard has 25 studies saying it causes a massive IQ reduction and the White House science.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.800]  So I wrote a book admitting they put it in the water to lower your IQ.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.800]  It's called Eco Science.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.800]  It's free online. Read it.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.800]  He goes, but I'm saving that for more credible outlook.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.800]  He's all part of incredible.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.800]  My answer to your question is no, absolutely not.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.800]  Not in my career to put it on.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.800]  I'm going to come back and finish up with this day with us.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:23.800]  But this is the essence of cowardice.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:28.800]  Is it graceful when you arrive in China, Saudi Arabia or Cuba and get snubbed at the airport?
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.800]  Is it graceful when you fumble your words?
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:38.800]  I've now been in 57 states. I think one left to go.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.800]  Is it powerful when you drone strike innocent people and joke about it?
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:48.800]  I have two words for you. Predator drones. You will never see it coming.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:57.800]  Is it powerful when golf is a greater priority than Louisiana? Is it graceful when you're out vacationing, playing golf and having a photo shoot when this country and the world is burning?
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:26.800]  This is Owen Schreuer from Infowars.com.

[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:19.800]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer. He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:27.800]  I said, let me see. Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated, price competitive companies we represent,
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:32.800]  and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:44.800]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.800]  How about you?

[01:22:49.800 --> 01:23:08.800]  There is an affordable alternative to the high cost of healthcare that offers freedom from insurance while providing compliance with the Obamacare individual mandate.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:20.800]  Imagine having access to quality, affordable healthcare that allows you the freedom to choose your doctor and hospital. Members can share up to 100% of necessary medical expenses, including some alternative treatments.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:40.800]  No doubt how you and your family can contain healthcare costs without giving up your freedom. Go to libertyoncall.org. That's libertyoncall.org.

[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:36.800]  It's Mr. Maddow, Ron Maddow last night on MSNBC, literally just flipping out with my face up there with Putin's and Trump's like it's the new Mount Rushmore.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:47.800]  And like I'm this evil scammer because I point out that there was mainstream news articles saying that if you have a lot of selenium in your body, it's very hard for Zika to replicate.
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:57.800]  I mean, I live in Texas where Zika has been found. I'm giving it to my kids. We came out with a high quality organic selenium. There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:11.800]  We're not bad selling vitamins and minerals. But again, what we got to do is actually find clips of the advertisers on MSNBC.
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:21.800]  You guys got to my company that have pretty good sponsors. I mean, they've got some some some nutraceutical sponsors on Fox that are excellent products.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:29.800]  I mean, it's like what you're selling serotonin reuptake inhibitors and all these other drugs that admittedly have all these horrible side effects.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:43.800]  And then we're doing stuff like, hey, you know, we got bio PQQ that has the equivalent of, you know, 50 cartons of blueberries and every serving. I mean, it's a fact.
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:52.800]  So this is economic warfare. They think doing this, it's going to somehow hurt us. So we're launching the Rachel Maddow special.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:26:02.800]  I know the Mr. Maddow special on every product she plugs and attacks an additional 15% off because some of these already have like 20% discounts.
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:09.800]  Running through this weekend. We also have high quality, swarable food, government's hoarding food, government's digging in, government's preparing for collapse.
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:15.800]  We think it's important. Hopefully none of this happens, but to have high quality, swarable food. I know I've been increasing the amount I have.
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:24.800]  I know the rich elites are all moving to armoured redoubts and putting in safe rims, but we're bad. Now food's evil. Maybe they'll pass a law saying, I can't say you need food to live.
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:30.800]  Or Jones's newest conspiracy theory, you need oxygen to live. That's insane.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:40.800]  Next, they'll say carbon dioxide's what plants live off of too. It's ridiculous. Everyone knows we've got a band of hydrogen monoxide.
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:51.800]  Water. Meanwhile, I have articles like this in front of me. They're banning George Washington and Thomas Jefferson from high schools, colleges, you name it.
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:58.800]  I'm going to get to this later because they own slaves and they moved to try to get it banned, but couldn't.
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:06.800]  So what do you do when this is going on? And I'm not defending the institution, but it wasn't all like roots to understand that.
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:13.800]  Basically like sharecroppers. He had really trashy, horrible people that were doing horrible things.
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:21.800]  The point is, is that there were slaves in the time of Jesus that the Jews had. Do we have to stop teaching the Bible because there was slavery?
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:30.800]  Slavery was worldwide until 200 years ago. And then England started the process of banning at worldwide Christian abolitionists.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:42.800]  Fact. Evil white devils began the process of banning slavery worldwide. And then evil white devils started running around blowing stuff up and killing people here until they started banning it here.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:51.800]  So it's just not fair to blame whites across the board. It's ridiculous. But I'm already digressing. We're dealing with a global organized crime syndicate that has dropped any pretense of being honest.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:59.800]  They're going completely insane. And Trump has come out and said in a speech yesterday that Hillary Clinton is running a global criminal enterprise.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:05.800]  And that's why they're going for broke. But the biggest news that I only mentioned a little bit last hour is coming up in the next segment.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:14.800]  Hillary was in Ohio and had to go into an emergency tent for 45 minutes with stretchers and people running around like a beehive had been hit with a baseball bat.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:19.800]  This is big news. What happened in Ohio? Our reporters were there and had the video. It's coming up.
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:24.800]  But first, here's Donald Trump on the criminal global enterprise of Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:37.800]  The whole country saw how unfit she was at the town hall last night where she refused to take accountability for her failed policies in the Middle East that have produced millions of refugees,
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:46.800]  unleashed horror of radical Islamic terrorism all over and made us less safe than ever before.
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:57.800]  Throughout it all, she put the country and I mean the entire country at risk in order to cover up her pay for play scandals as Secretary of State.
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:09.800]  These include scandals giving up uranium to Russia, doing favors for UBS Bank and selling contracts to friends and family in Haiti.
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:17.800]  It's all about hiding criminal enterprise and that's what it's about as part of her criminal cover up.
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:24.800]  Hillary's and you know her staff, you know it well. You read about it all the time.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:28.800]  We're going to come back and play this full clip because it's historic that he's telling the truth.
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.800]  He's incredibly bold and what he's saying is all true.
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:38.800]  And so the criminals in the dying mainstream media are doing everything they can to try to stop the American people from taking their country back.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:46.800]  The Russians kicked the oligarchs out. We're going to kick your asses out as well, parasites. Stay with us. We'll be back.
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:17.800]  Concerns about Hillary Clinton's health are serious. Could be disqualifying for the position of President of the U.S.
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:26.800]  Says nearly 71% of 250 physicians responding to an informal Internet survey by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:33.800]  About 20% said concerns were likely overblown but should be addressed as by full release of medical records.
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:41.800]  Only 2.7% responded that they were just a political attack while more than 81% were aware of her history of a concussion.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:49.800]  Only 59% were aware of the cerebral sinus thrombosis and 52% of the history of deep venous thrombosis.
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:54.800]  Obviously there's something going on with Hillary's health and it's not sexist to question it.
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:31:04.800]  Find more reports like this at infowars.com.
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:31.800]  Fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening today. I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:38.800]  Now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:45.800]  Which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:52.800]  This is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen.

[01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:06.800]  We're not powered by arrogance but by dogged stalwart determination and to know that we have got on our side in Providence
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:12.800]  with a new enlightenment and the next true leap forward.
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:19.800]  Alright these headlines are too insane. I haven't gotten to a lot of these. I want to finish up with this incredible Trump speech, this clip that I cut short
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:26.800]  and I want to then get into racial mad out. It's a 13 minute clip. I don't know if I can hear the whole thing. We're going to put a blurb up on infowarsteam.com.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:32.800]  But again it isn't about racial mad out talking about us. She literally is one of the top shows on MSNBC.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:37.800]  Half a million viewers a night. I mean that's pathetic sweetheart.
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:42.800]  We put out videos every day that get millions of views apiece just individual videos.
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:49.800]  This show has upwards of 4 million a day terrestrial rated listeners on radio stations.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:55.800]  And that's a small part of our audience. I mean you're a joke. You are a joke.
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:35:04.800]  But you're totally White House run on record so it's very interesting to just see what you say and how amateurs it all is.
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:15.800]  It's funny to really see them flounder around like this. We do have a preparedness special running right now 30-40% off on high quality storeable foods at infowarsteam.com.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:20.800]  But we've added a lot of new specials. We're adding the Mr. Maddow special. That's actually what it's called.
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:27.800]  And it is 20% off on survival shield X2 because that's ongoing. 15% off supermilial vitality. 50% off deep cleanse.
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:35.800]  These are the things she all demonized and attacked. Oh my gosh. We're so ashamed that we went on air and talked about how selenium is good for you.
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:40.800]  And they claimed it was tied into articles that were on our side at the same time like that's something bad.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:49.800]  Yes I'm here going hey we're selling selenium. Wow it's in the news about selenium and Zika. Wow look at this.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:58.800]  Exactly. See within everything's from a deception point of view. So if something lines up it's like a deception.
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:04.800]  No we've made a big deal that day over the fact that we have an article out about selenium and Zika.
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:10.800]  Our writers didn't even know we were launching a new product bio true selenium from mustard seed.
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:15.800]  Needed electrochemically throughout the body. I mean if you're a racial Maddow viewer okay.
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:24.800]  A lot of liberals I know are really smart on supplements. Selenium is like the hottest thing for a decade.
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:33.800]  I mean you don't have electrochemical activity in the body without it. You die without it.
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:37.800]  And most of the forms that they put in multivitamins and things are synthetic.
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:41.800]  So yes we sell bio true selenium from mustard seed. I'm very proud of that.
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:46.800]  We're guilty and bad because I sell Hillary for prison shirts at cost.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:51.800]  I should sell them for a profit to fund the operation. I mean General Flynn says yeah walk her up in prison.
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:59.800]  That was chanted at the RNC. It was said by mothers of dead navy seals. I think Hillary should be in prison.
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:05.800]  And I'm economically and culturally kicking your ass. MSNBC has been bankrupt for years.
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:12.800]  It's just propped up by the big banks because they don't want to admit their facade is falling. We're not bankrupt Dumbo.
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:16.800]  You try to come in with the FDA and shut down our supplements. Snap my fingers.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:22.800]  The listeners will flood us with more money than you ever saw. You can't find your ass with both hands.
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:27.800]  You don't understand what you're dealing with and you're a joke and a fake liberal and a pseudo-intellectual.
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:32.800]  And I'm sick of people like you. You're a joke.
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:36.800]  How are you going to feel as more and more about your world government comes out and more and more emails come out
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:42.800]  and more and more corruption comes out. You think WikiLeaks doesn't have stuff far worse than it's releasing
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:47.800]  that the power structure itself doesn't want out because it's so damaging.
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:51.800]  You really hitched your wagon to the wrong pony sweetheart.
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:59.800]  Again, she's just a symbol, an example, a figurehead, a logo of what we're dealing with here.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:02.800]  But they are coming after us on every front, which I'm very, very proud of.
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:05.800]  But let me just go over some of these headlines for you.
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:08.800]  George Washington banished by PC police World Net Daily.
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:12.800]  The president of San Francisco Board of Educators wants Washington and Jefferson banned as school names
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.800]  because the American founders had slaves.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:18.800]  And they want colleges to pull the name off of dorms called Lynch.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:25.800]  It's an Irish name because there's a word called lynching. This is total war on reality.
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:29.800]  A history professor rips down campus 9-11, never forget posters.
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:33.800]  This is the same professor that came out and said that we deserve 9-11.
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:35.800]  And it happened because we're imperialists.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:38.800]  No, the globalists worked with Saudi Arabia to carry this out.
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:50.800]  And Al Qaeda is carrying out its own Islamist garbage, carrying out its own Islamist colonialism.
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:52.800]  Let's continue here.
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:57.800]  Assange up to 100,000 pages of Clinton documents come true.
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:00.800]  Earlier I was going from memory. I said 10,000 more next week. I have to correct myself.
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:03.800]  See, I don't really exaggerate. I tend to just somehow dial stuff back.
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:07.800]  It's 100,000. Let me correct myself from last hour.
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:11.800]  Pages of Clinton documents to come. That's next week. So get ready for that.
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:16.800]  But it's okay. We have the video clip up on M4s.com. Nancy Pelosi on Clinton emails.
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:20.800]  Let's just move on from this and just forget about it.
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:23.800]  Because she's been caught in total lies and more is coming out.
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:29.800]  We have this botoxed, taxidermied, living dead creature worth billions of dollars.
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:31.800]  Worth nothing when she got into office.
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:36.800]  This bloated creature up there.
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:41.800]  I mean, give me a break. It's like a Pomeranian.
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:47.800]  Don't worry though. Former IMF economist declares war on cash as we must get rid of it to bring in the world government.
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:51.800]  Dozens of pregnant women have Zika virus. I mean, growing outbreak in Miami.
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:53.800]  International business times. But don't worry.
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:59.800]  Don't tell women about the international studies that it's basically almost impossible to get Zika.
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:03.800]  If you have high amounts of selenium in your body and that only the deficiency allows the virus to replicate.
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:06.800]  Don't tell anybody to go to the local drug store and get selenium.
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:12.800]  Don't tell anybody the answer. A major mitigator. No. No, no, no.
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:17.800]  Or Rachel Maddow who looks anorexic on TV.
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:21.800]  In person, I'm told she looks like a beanpole.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:27.800]  I'm not trying to tell how she looks, but it's like, why is it so authoritative that a woman doesn't look like a man?
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:30.800]  And she's got a short, or a woman doesn't look like a woman.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:31.800]  She looks like a man.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:41.800]  And then it's like the uniform of these arrogant, weird women with big long giraffe necks and big Adam's apples like they're aliens.
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:45.800]  And then they just sit there and spew talking points off a teleprompter at us.
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:50.800]  I've got plenty of intellectual points against Maddow, but I mean, what is it?
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:54.800]  I mean, what's the issue? What's going on?
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:57.800]  I mean, I don't care if women like women. I like women. I get it.
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:01.800]  The point is, I'm a libertarian. The point is, is like, what is it about these people?
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:05.800]  Why is she out to get us? I mean, what do we do to her?
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:08.800]  This is the net. I mean, look at that.
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:12.800]  I can't even do it. Just like them.
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.800]  I just get them so.
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:17.800]  It doesn't matter. We don't have any viewers compared to Alex Jones.
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:20.800]  We imagine we do so. We're important.
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:22.800]  Look, the whole world's against you, lady.
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:25.800]  The whole world's turned against you. You're a joke.
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:32.800]  Your goddess is a faltering creature spewing up huge green globlets.
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:37.800]  If your goddess was a reincarnated Marilyn Monroe, I might have to admit you're going to win.
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:41.800]  But see, you hate the goddess. That's why you don't ever look like a goddess.
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:45.800]  You hate women. You want to control women. You want to pimp women.
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:51.800]  You, you think strength is imitating the worst men.
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:56.800]  You are the opposite of a feminist. Let's get that clear, sweetheart.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:02.800]  Now, continuing with our coverage here of Chris Hayes, excuse me, Rachel Manow.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:11.800]  I'm going to get some other news here. Obama pushes lame duck TPP despite uproar over pro corporate provisions.
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:16.800]  Syrian rebel who kidnapped and shot journals twice now CIA backed moderate.
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:18.800]  Of course.
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:26.800]  And then I've got articles here where the Mexican government wants to renege on the Treaty of Guadalupe, Hidalgo,
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:34.800]  that seeded California, Texas, parts of Oregon, New Mexico, you name it, to the United States.
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:36.800]  Here's a little newsflash. There were six flags over Texas.
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.800]  There were four or five flags over California.
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:43.800]  The Mexican government couldn't hold it from the natives.
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:50.800]  And so this claim that this was all Mexico is just stupid.
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:55.800]  Yeah, Guatemala was Mexico too. Couldn't keep that.
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:59.800]  How many Americans know the history of Mexico? Almost none. How many Mexicans know it? Almost none.
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:05.800]  I know it. Probably read 15 books on the subject. Santa Ana was engaged in all these atrocities.
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:10.800]  Basically brought back slavery. Didn't call it that. The Guatemalans broke away.
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:14.800]  You know, Mexico used to basically be Central America.
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:18.800]  Okay, are they claiming Guatemala back, you know, from Mexico now?
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:23.800]  They say if Trump gets in, they've introduced a bill to secede from the United States.
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:29.800]  And people make jokes about that. If we're run by globalists, they'll let them do that.
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:34.800]  But none of that's going to happen. They're merging our countries. It's so incredibly saddening.
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:39.800]  And then we have all these other videos here of Mexican nationals in the U.S.
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:45.800]  calling for the murder of Donald Trump. Don't hold your breath to see if any of that happens.
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:50.800]  And again, these are just like the general population of the U.S. dumbed down people
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:56.800]  that really think they're on a holy crusade to stop this evil Donald Trump that really wants to hurt them.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:02.800]  And the truth is the United States is used like a giant latrine by the globalist.
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:08.800]  Now, Rachel Maddow is coming up, but we probably should play the Mexican guy saying kill everybody.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:14.800]  But let's play Trump, because I didn't get to the whole clip, breaking down the criminal enterprise that Hillary runs.
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:19.800]  And this is the truth. She's been caught. It's worse than we thought. I didn't even imagine
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:23.800]  she'd be selling access to the Chinese president that came out last week.
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:29.800]  I mean, it's just 100,000 pages of stuff. Assange better release it now
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:35.800]  just to have time in the next 58 days to the election to see what's in there.
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:40.800]  But here is Donald Trump, who I've gone from tacitly supporting to absolutely supporting.
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:47.800]  What a statesman. What a man. What stamina. What courage. What bravada.
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:51.800]  You talk about machismo. He's got it. Here it is.
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:56.800]  The whole country saw how unfit she was at the town hall last night,
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:01.800]  where she refused to take accountability for her failed policies in the Middle East
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:04.800]  that have produced millions of refugees,
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:09.800]  unleashed horror of radical Islamic terrorism all over,
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:13.800]  and made us less safe than ever before.
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:18.800]  Throughout it all, she put the country, and I mean the entire country, at risk
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:24.800]  in order to cover up her pay for play scandals as Secretary of State.
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:28.800]  These include scandals giving up uranium to Russia,
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:36.800]  doing favors for UBS Bank, and selling contracts to friends and family in Haiti.
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:42.800]  It's all about hiding criminal enterprise, and that's what it's about.
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:49.800]  As part of her criminal cover-up, Hillary's, and you know her staff, you know it well.
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:55.800]  You read about it all the time. You just read about it, and it's getting worse and worse.
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:46:01.800]  Hillary Clinton's staff deleted and digitally bleached, which is acid-cleaned.
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:07.800]  Her emails after receiving a congressional subpoena.
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:13.800]  That's after receiving, not before. That's after receiving.
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:23.800]  Then, when she was interviewed by the FBI, she claimed she couldn't remember important events 39 times.
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:25.800]  Because of the head injury.
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:31.800]  She couldn't even remember whether she was trained or handling classified information.
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:33.800]  She said because she was brainless.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:37.800]  So she really didn't remember. That's a problem.
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:41.800]  And if she did remember, that's a problem.
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:45.800]  She even said she didn't know what the letter C stood for.
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:51.800]  Whether it was confidential, classified information, or something.
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:57.800]  All the while, as Hillary and Bill raked in millions of dollars from special interest,
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:01.800]  the world was falling apart.
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:07.800]  Hillary Clinton's policies produced ruin in Libya, Iraq, and Syria.
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:10.800]  Absolute ruin and death.
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:18.800]  She failed in Russia. She failed in China. She failed miserably in North Korea.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:25.800]  Her policies unleashed ISIS, spread terrorism, and put Iran on a path to nuclear weapons.
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:26.800]  That's right.
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:28.800]  Not to mention the ransom payments.
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:29.800]  We're being set up.
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:31.800]  Oh, those ransom payments.
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:37.800]  Remember two weeks ago, it was $400 million in cash.
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:38.800]  That's $1.6 billion.
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:46.800]  Well, yesterday we found out that in cash, it was $1.7 billion.
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:47.800]  That's right.
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:49.800]  This is cash.
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:52.800]  This is in wire transfer. This is in check.
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:57.800]  This is cash. $1.7 billion.
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:04.800]  And then you say, is that going to terror, or is that going to people's bank accounts?
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:07.800]  I actually think it's going to both.
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:10.800]  Of course it is. Trump's so smart.
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.800]  I wish he'd let us know this a decade ago.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:16.800]  But he was being a sleeper, so for the Patriots, amazing.
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:21.800]  Reality is so much stranger than affection, as it's been said many times.
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:26.800]  I've got so much more to get into, but people need to understand that when I told you that
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:30.800]  Mexico is talking about breaking its treaty, they were paid money, by the way,
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:33.800]  of Guadalupe Hidalgo from the 1840s.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:35.800]  That's in the London Telegraph.
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:37.800]  I mean, this is going on out of Mexico City.
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:44.800]  And they've made the minister in Mexico that invited Trump down to resign.
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:46.800]  Because they invited him down there.
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:47.800]  I mean, Hillary won't even show up.
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:49.800]  They just think the fix is in.
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:50.800]  They think they have all the answers.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:54.800]  They think we're done, but we're not.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:57.800]  Now I have a lot more to cover, but going out to break.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:01.800]  Let's play this childlike fool.
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:03.800]  And you see this all over the web.
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:08.800]  The New York Times calls for the death of Donald Trump saying go out and kill.
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:10.800]  Go out and kill Donald Trump.
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:13.800]  Kill his supporters.
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:15.800]  This is up on info wars.com.
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:19.800]  Kill Trump and as many of his supporters as possible.
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:22.800]  And then you see mainstream media acting like this is cute.
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:24.800]  This is funny.
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:28.800]  And this poor young man really thinks he's doing good.
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:32.800]  He really thinks the mainstream media is his friend distorting what Trump stands for
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:34.800]  and saying all this.
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:37.800]  I'd love to say to this guy, like, what is he, 18 years old?
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:41.800]  Okay, Mexico puts me in jail for six months to a year if I get caught illegally there
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:42.800]  and deports me.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:46.800]  And they will go, well, you are Mexico.
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:47.800]  Yeah.
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:49.800]  And France and Russia and everything else.
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:53.800]  And at that point, it's just like, stop being a baby.
[01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:55.800]  It's this entitlement.
[01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:56.800]  It's like, I've been robbed.
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:57.800]  I've been cheated.
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:49:59.800]  I've been, give me a break.
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:03.800]  The globalists want to extinguish what's left of the engine of freedom in America.
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:06.800]  I know America's got problems, but the globalists are the big issue.
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:07.800]  I'm going to skip this break.
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:12.800]  The New World Order is the issue, son.
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:14.800]  GMO is the issue.
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.800]  Gardasil is the issue.
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:23.800]  I guarantee if I talk to this dumbass, at least a lot of broke through his cognitive dissonance.
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:33.800]  And I said, you know, every woman in Mexico that is 12 to 13 years old is being given
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:38.800]  a Gardasil shot that's been banned in Japan and India and all over and causes massive
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:39.800]  infertility by design.
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:42.800]  It doesn't protect you from papillomavirus.
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:46.800]  That is one of the rarest forms of cancer to begin with.
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:48.800]  It is a contraceptive, just like Zika.
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:52.800]  Because I've told people this and met you on the rise of their face.
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:55.800]  They just go, shut up, you know, that face, gringo.
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:57.800]  Just like David Duke, I had him on.
[01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:58.800]  I was like, we should come together.
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:50:59.800]  The globalists are doing it.
[01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:00.800]  Kim trailing us.
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:01.800]  Bio weapons.
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:02.800]  We're all under attack.
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:03.800]  New World Order.
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:04.800]  Humanity must come together.
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:06.800]  And he's like, oh, you're just covered up for the Jews.
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:10.800]  It's just like, listen, we can argue all day who runs this.
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:11.800]  All I know is, I don't want aluminum spray.
[01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:14.800]  I don't want aluminum sprayed on anybody, no matter what color they are.
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:18.800]  I don't want people taking vaccines that admittedly have cancer viruses in almost
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:19.800]  every one of them.
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:24.800]  The Gardasil shot has killed admittedly hundreds and hundreds of people in the
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:25.800]  U.S. alone.
[01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:28.800]  And that's a very small portion of those we know that's killed.
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:31.800]  Autoimmune disorders, massive infertility.
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:38.800]  I've been saying for 12 years, it's an infertility vaccine.
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:44.800]  I mean, no, they didn't because in the trials, it killed so many women.
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:48.800]  I've had the mothers on with their 12 year old cheerleader daughter, takes the shot,
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:52.800]  has convulsions for a week, bleeds out of their eyes, their butt everywhere else and
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:53.800]  dies.
[01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:58.800]  You know, I'm going to sit here and say, I'm not racist.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:00.800]  I don't want to kill Mexicans.
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:02.800]  Don't take the shot.
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:04.800]  It's called understanding.
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:07.800]  People think you're either totally four open borders in world government or you want
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:10.800]  all the Mexicans know how about I'm not going to be walked on.
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:11.800]  I'm not going to be run over.
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:12.800]  I'm not going to be attacked racially.
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:15.800]  I'm not going to be told I'm the author of everything bad in the world.
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:16.800]  You slip down the stairs.
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:17.800]  I did it.
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:21.800]  But at the same time, I don't want to sit there and sterilize and kill you.
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:24.800]  See, I see you like I see myself.
[01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:28.800]  I want to be treated like I treat others.
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:34.800]  Let me, let's play this guy talking about kill Donald Trump, kill everybody.
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:37.800]  This is just routine for the Internet.
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:38.800]  Here it is.
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:45.800]  We Mexicans have to kill Donald J. Trump before he becomes president.
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:52.800]  He is a threat to every single one of us Mexicans.
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:53:00.800]  There are many Mexicans living in the U.S. right now and I'm asking them to kill Donald
[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:04.800]  Trump before he becomes president.
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:13.800]  The ones in Mexico who have the means, I'm asking you to cross the border and go and
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:18.800]  kill Donald Trump and as many as his supporters as possible.
[01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:24.800]  Anywhere he goes, just try to bomb the place, shoot up the place, do something.
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:25.800]  Think about this.
[01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:28.800]  This is my reason why I'm asking for this.
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:35.800]  If you could go back in time and kill Hitler and kill the Nazis, would you do it?
[01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:44.800]  Now, we have a modern day Hitler and we, we have to kill him before he gets into power.
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:50.800]  So I want you to spread this message and I'm encouraging every single Mexican out there
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:59.800]  who has the guts to stand up for the Mexican people and to kill Trump and his Nazi followers.
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:00.800]  Let's do this.
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:01.800]  Viva Mexico.
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:02.800]  Viva Mexico.
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:03.800]  What is Mexico?
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:06.800]  A captured globalist enclave just like the U.S.
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:09.800]  Trump went down there and said let's get off one of the New World Order.
[01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:10.800]  Let's be prosperous.
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:11.800]  Let's end all this garbage.
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:12.800]  Let's end this big drug war.
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:14.800]  Let's do this.
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:21.800]  But this guy believes that the stuff he gets from the Spanish media that's globalist to own and run
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:24.800]  is some message of goodness.
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:28.800]  Imagine if Trump does get killed by a Mexican national.
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:30.800]  How's that going to work?
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:36.800]  See, Trump knows he can't lose.
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:38.800]  Can't lose for winning.
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:39.800]  Can't win for losing.
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:40.800]  Not with this.
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:43.800]  When you do the right thing, you cannot lose, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:44.800]  Hold on.
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:45.800]  Trump, he wins.
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:46.800]  Don't kill him.
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:52.800]  He wins because there are one sided trade deals to screw over the middle class and to
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:57.800]  end prosperity because the New World Order on record says they don't want you having your
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:54:58.800]  own economy.
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:01.800]  And with that said, let's start a little bit in the next hour.
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:05.800]  Then Rob is joining us on vaccine force vaccine news that affects everybody.
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:09.800]  Let's start with Rachel Maddow last night.
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:16.800]  13 minute report of total disinformation, twisting and panicking.
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:20.800]  Because info wars is so horrible and we're run by Vladimir Putin.
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:23.800]  Let's start the report.
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:31.800]  Will artificial intelligence enslave humanity before the globalists do?
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:33.800]  Ever wondered?
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:37.800]  Do you also know that Hillary Clinton uses a wheelchair?
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:42.800]  Her personal vehicle has had to be outfitted with a wheelchair lift because she is not
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:44.800]  a person who can actually walk.
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:48.800]  She secretly uses a wheelchair all those times you think you've seen her walking.
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:49.800]  She hasn't been walking.
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:50.800]  Did you know that?
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:54.800]  Did you also know that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson's disease?
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:56.800]  No, these things are true.
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:00.800]  I know they are true because I read them in the headlines.
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:02.800]  Here I will prove it to you.
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:06.800]  Will artificial intelligence enslave humanity before the globalists do?
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:08.800]  AI, artificial intelligence.
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:10.800]  Back it up, 10 seconds.
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:15.800]  Stephen Hawking, all the top futurists and scientists concur with our analysis.
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:18.800]  The Pentagon says they're worried about AI taking over.
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:21.800]  The globalists admit they're getting rid of humans.
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:23.800]  They admit that the future doesn't need us.
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:28.800]  That's the name of an article from Art Magazine, Rachel.
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:32.800]  And then you sit there and show headlines like you're discrediting us.
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:34.800]  We didn't say Hillary couldn't walk.
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:36.800]  There are lifts on her vehicles.
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:37.800]  We have photos.
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.800]  We have it from the Secret Service.
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:40.800]  She's got major medical problems.
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:42.800]  A straw man, Maddow.
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:45.800]  You just misrepresented what we're saying.
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:49.800]  We did not say she can't walk.
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:51.800]  We said she has neurological problems.
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:55.800]  And major medical associations are saying she clearly has it.
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:56.800]  So there you go.
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:58.800]  Let's go back to your confidence game.
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:56:59.800]  These things are true.
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:02.800]  I know they are true because I read them in the headlines.
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:04.800]  Here, I will prove it to you.
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:09.800]  Will artificial intelligence enslave humanity before the globalists do?
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:12.800]  AI, artificial intelligence, is taking over.
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:14.800]  That one was a special report.
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:19.800]  Here was the shock headline on Hillary Clinton's wheelchair vehicle.
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:22.800]  Just one column over from that.
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:25.800]  There was also this seemingly competing news.
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:29.800]  Hillary Clinton, does Hillary Clinton have Parkinson's disease?
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:36.800]  At the top of her head there, we can all see she has some very serious health problems.
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:38.800]  Back it up.
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:45.800]  In the WikiLeaks, in that article, she's trying to get Parkinson's medication.
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:49.800]  Just like Abudin says, do you need your earpiece?
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:51.800]  She's clearly got major problems, Maddow.
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:53.800]  But just keep trying to make us look like cooks.
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:54.800]  Let's continue.
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:56.800]  One column over from that.
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:02.320]  there was also this seemingly competing news, Hillary Clinton, does Hillary
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:06.800]  Clinton have Parkinson's disease? The subhead there, we can all see she has
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:12.680]  some very serious health problems. At this same news source for all of those
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:16.320]  stories you can also find important maybe even life-saving health information
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:22.960]  about a powerful new micronutrient that fights the Zika virus. You'll be happy to
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:26.600]  know that once you have learned about this powerful new micronutrient, this
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:31.880]  service, this website will sell you that powerful new micronutrient, thus curing
[01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:37.280]  your Zika. They will also sell you that alongside their super male vitality
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:41.840]  potions. Yeah just try to see what happens. I gotta say a little steep, 50. We're gonna
[01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:45.080]  come back with Cupcake, we're gonna come back with her. Of course if you're a radio
[01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:53.280]  listener you can't see, she's got info wars on screen. Brainforce, it's completely different.
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:59.400]  Try a bottle of it. Rob do, joins us. You worked I guess like 20 plus hours. Tell
[01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:02.280]  us what Brainforce did. I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off
[01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:07.440]  coaching basketball. I get in here at 8 30. I was kind of run down, you know, I
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:10.400]  just didn't feel like I was gonna make it and I really wanted to do a good job on
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:13.400]  the interview. I got my bottle of Brainforce right there, I popped two of
[01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:17.640]  them and about 20 minutes later it's like bing everything just kind of clears
[01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:22.080]  up. It's got four and a half stars, people really love it. Read about it, find out why
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:26.280]  third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does
[01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:31.000]  have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.560]  pulled an all-nighter like that in a while but I probably could not have
[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:37.960]  done it without Brainforce. I went home about 6 45 this morning, took three hours
[01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:41.480]  of sleep, got up, took two more Brainforce and came in. You will find
[01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:46.760]  Brainforce and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:51.600]  888-253-3139.
[01:59:51.600 --> 02:00:12.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:22.440]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:28.720]  Alright, so we're analyzing government propaganda, state remedy of propaganda.
[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:35.120]  13 minutes flip out by Rachel Maddow where she puts out the standard talking
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:39.800]  point that I worked for the Russians and so does Donald Trump. I'm a really evil
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:45.240]  because BBC associated pressure and we're doing their job reporting on the
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:50.520]  fact that selenium deficiency has been directly linked to the spread of the
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:57.080]  Zika virus in your body and so we're horrible evil profiteers for selling
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:02.520]  something at a very low price that people need. So let's continue with
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:09.040]  Rachel Maddow's misrepresentations. Super male vitality potion which is I
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:15.160]  gotta say a little steep $59.95 plus shipping and handling for the
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:20.720]  increase to your male vitality. If that price tag is too high for your below the
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:24.760]  belt problems fellas you can spend about half that much to get the survival
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:29.840]  shield X2 which is apparently according to the description there leading the way
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:37.120]  into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine. The big bargain
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:39.960]  though I think at this news site has got to be this one they're deep cleanse
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:44.320]  elixir and I don't quite I have to say I don't quite totally understand the
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:49.840]  description here it either has powerful nano colloidal zeolites or it will get
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:54.280]  rid of your powerful nano colloidal zeolites I can't quite tell but your
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:02:00.040]  neocoloidal zeolites will never be the same. All of this incredible news about
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:04.040]  the artificial intelligence that is enslaving humanity before the globalist
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:09.240]  zoo and the secret micronutrients that cure zika and the male vitality potions
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:16.200]  and all then the the nascent iodine. All of this stuff is of course available through infowars.com
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:22.240]  info wars is the conspiracy theory website sort of mega website where the
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:26.000]  dimmer bulbs among us have long gone to get themselves brightened out without
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.520]  the benefit of a surge protector. So horrible. The government lies out of hand you're saying
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:34.400]  well then why do you believe in the moon landing because I have sources inside NASA
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:40.200]  they put on some fake stuff for you see there was a lie see it's not just did we
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:43.800]  go or didn't we go you were shown the tinkered toy stuff because you're not
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:46.680]  supposed to see what they really got you're not supposed to know the thousands
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:51.040]  of astronauts that have died oh yes I should do all the show on them. We're
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:59.160]  already in a tyranny and then Operation Jade Helm gets announced it was put on
[02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:02.840]  the army website last week we reported on it first. And they'll have some real
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:06.180]  missions they're legitimate mixed in to confuse the idiot public kind of like
[02:03:06.180 --> 02:03:12.960]  cyanide pills you know taste like sugar or 80% sugar yeah so Sandy Hook is a
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:19.640]  synthetic completely fake with actors in my view manufactured I couldn't believe
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:23.560]  it at first I knew they had actors there clearly but I thought they killed
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:28.400]  some real kids and it just shows how bold they are. You saw them stage fast and
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:32.600]  furious folks they staged Aurora they stage Sandy Hook the evidence is just
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:35.440]  overwhelming. But the reason there's so many gay people now is because it's a
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:38.360]  chemical warfare operation I have the government documents where they said
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:41.720]  they're gonna encourage homosexuality with chemicals so that people don't have
[02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:45.920]  children. I even catch myself Bob bringing out of these estrogen
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:50.000]  mimicers for those watching on Prison Planet TV here's the inside of this
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:56.120]  juice box and if they zoom in anymore see that thin plastic it's got it and I'm
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:04:02.600]  letting my children drink this. So again they've taken a bunch of clips out of
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:06.960]  context some of it's accurate some of it's not and then I specified reference
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:11.100]  that I said thousands of test pilots have died in the NASA program hundreds they
[02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:14.760]  admit to it is in the thousands I mean thousands have died trying to have
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:20.520]  troops jump out of C-130s with you know vehicles and tanks and motorcycles and
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:23.800]  you hear about a helicopter accident but yeah there's a big secret space
[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:28.280]  program everybody knows that but they try to sit there and play games they
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:32.800]  didn't show that I had in studio the late great Raymond T who's famously running
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:37.440]  the cameras on the moon and Skylab and everything else this that came from him
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:44.680]  and others and different former head of Star Wars program we also had on the
[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:48.120]  broadcast so see that's how they take it all out of context then they move on to
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:53.480]  Trump and Putin after this it's amazing what they're doing this attempted
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:57.560]  prosecution will not work folks can see it's all heavily edited out of context
[02:04:57.560 --> 02:05:01.880]  info wars.com are running the Rachel Maddow special right now. Barack and
[02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:05.240]  Michelle Obama took some time out of their busy schedules of golf and
[02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:09.440]  vacation to use the White House as a photography studio. Essence and InStyle
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:13.640]  magazines were the lucky invitees both of which will be featuring the Obamas on
[02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:17.840]  next month's magazine covers. Essence will feature the cover reading Grace and
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:22.240]  Power with the Obamas pictured behind and InStyle will feature Michelle with
[02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:26.200]  the cover reading powerful. Is it graceful when you arrive in China Saudi
[02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:30.120]  Arabia or Cuba and get snubbed at the airport? Is it graceful when you fumble
[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:40.040]  your words? I've now been in 57 states I think one left to go. Is it powerful when
[02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:43.760]  you drone strike innocent people and joke about it? I have two words for you
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:51.040]  predator drones. You will never see it coming. Is it powerful when golf is a
[02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:54.600]  greater priority than Louisiana? Is it graceful when you're out vacationing
[02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:58.280]  playing golf and having a photo shoot when this country in the world is burning?

[02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:35.160]  answers that mean we got it all right but we have hearts and wills and souls
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:41.380]  that are turned towards God and trying to do the best we can. Providence will
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:47.360]  provide and it is all right so Rachel Maddow went into an unprecedented and
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:51.200]  again this is a White House mouthpiece doesn't have a lot of viewers but it
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:56.240]  does get parroted by other media so it's somewhat important going into a 13
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:09:00.200]  minute conniption fit of misrepresentation lies edited videos
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:05.040]  distortions you name it to attack yours truly because her lordship last week
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:09.560]  attacked of course info wars and so if you just joined us she started like five
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:13.920]  minutes into demonization six minutes in all the horrible things we're doing I
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:17.960]  mean we claim you need oxygen we claim you need water we claim you need vitamin
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:24.000]  C we're horrible people we sell things to fund ourselves this is
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:30.000]  unprecedentedly evil that's why we're running the mr. Maddow special 50%
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:33.760]  also know about talent if you percent off deep cleanse per percent off survival
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:38.280]  shield nation I-9 x2 I mean there's major iodine deficiency we have record
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:43.320]  level thyroid problems in this country Hillary has one and they will not tell
[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:48.200]  you that's because the fluoride the water they just make jokes about it all
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:53.600]  day the federal government had them put iodine insult starting the 20s and IQs
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:58.800]  went up 15% in the Midwest to Google it then they started taking it out we're
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:02.600]  just saying if you choose this is the true pure iodine and yes we find ourselves
[02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:06.160]  with it so the Rachel Maddow special isn't having ratings yet this is brand
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:10.640]  new went up about an hour ago but you can get big discounts right now on those
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:15.880]  that helps fund the operation alright continuing here ladies and gentlemen
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:22.600]  let's go back to Rachel Chris Hayes Maddow I said because I think they're both
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:29.120]  the same person an actor I'm joking but it is a striking resemblance maybe she's
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:33.280]  the daughter of Bill Clinton okay I'm joking that's as fictitious the stuff
[02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:38.560]  she's saying on her show let's go back to it bring us down and removing us the
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:43.600]  decision has been made cheer up the post-human era is dawning the plan is an
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:49.120]  asexual humanoid even if they decide to keep us around you got all that I
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:54.880]  actually think I think reflected upon this this thesis plus here is the
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:59.960]  asexual humanoid right here mad that I'm talking about the admitted globalist
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:03.960]  plan that I'm reading out of the Journal of Science I'm reading out of the
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:07.760]  Financial Times of London I'm reading out of Wired magazine you've all seen
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:12.240]  these articles I'm covering it and she's just acting like I'm totally crazy like
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:15.640]  Obamacare having death panels or Obamacare not whether you keep your doctor
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:19.720]  Obamacare doubling your prices or tripling them it's all admitted now we
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:24.440]  have groopers saying thank God we're stupid well I'm not stupid Maddow just
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:28.320]  because you're another arrogant you know person with full of criminology who
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:35.000]  think she's invincible you're not jackass let's continue with Rachel Maddow
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:40.280]  the last part there I think when he says that the eugenics transhumanist cult
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:43.800]  that wants to confuse the general species ahead of rendering us down and
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:47.000]  removing us I think what he says rendering us down I literally think he
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.160]  means that we're going to be melted and turned into candles like they're gonna
[02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:53.800]  use our fat to make a little pause slime back I think we're getting her
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:57.680]  religion here she doesn't like it okay she's a parasite she's into praying on
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:01.360]  you she's gonna keep it you in the dark and so no rendering us down means using
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:07.480]  our energy our our developments our innovations our technology our will to
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:11.120]  build your world government to build your technocracy then you merge with
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:16.440]  machines and we get exterminated that's what Ray Kurzweil says that's what the
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:22.280]  globalists say that's the plan lady you're there making a joke about stuff
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:28.320]  that's known just like TPP just like any of this I'm telling you what the plan
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:33.640]  is like I mean they've had pieces a few weeks ago going he's crazy he says
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:37.520]  danger of nuclear war has never been worse I've got all these top scholars
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:41.880]  top military publications saying the same thing that's where I'm getting it
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:44.200]  lady
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:49.840]  but there's something about these arrogant parasites they just think
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:55.400]  they're so smart no globalist took control of society through fraud finance
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:13:00.680]  you but you have no viewers but we do occasionally show you to illustrate the
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:06.720]  arrogance of a clown let's go back to it during I think he's literal on that that
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:13.800]  that is the the the the pilot the captain of America's conspiracy theory
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:17.760]  mothership Alex Jones and Alex Jones has been around forever I'm assuming he
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:21.160]  will be around forever he says Hillary Clinton is going to kill him he has
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:26.040]  publicly asked Hillary Clinton not to kill him so who knows but honestly he's
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:30.160]  gonna be around for while he's a very lucrative gig oh now it's a lucrative
[02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:33.120]  gig I mean around forever oh my gosh they're bemoaning the fact that it's
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:36.200]  hard to go after me they're bemoaning the fact that good elements of the
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:39.760]  government have got us watched constantly and every time they send
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:45.880]  somebody they get snatched up like that I mean you cannot stand it can you you
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:52.680]  cannot stand it and so you sit there implying that we're the big mothership
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:59.800]  of all this and that we're just spewing all this just info that is not what's
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:03.880]  happening here the truth is the globalists have this plan they think we
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:07.360]  don't count we're gonna discuss the plan and see what the public thinks about it
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:11.520]  and the public doesn't like your plan back to mr. Maddow
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:15.560]  free Clinton is going to kill him he has publicly asked Hillary Clinton not to
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:20.000]  kill him so who knows but honestly he's gonna be around for a while it's a very
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:23.520]  lucrative gig he's got going on he pause again don't back it up I want to
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:27.760]  just say something about this again Hillary brags that she came she saw he
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:31.240]  died she overthrows innocent countries she's financed the murder of hundreds of
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:35.120]  thousands of Christians in Africa hundreds of thousands of Syria the whole
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:38.840]  world admits yeah they single out Christians and kill them they hate us I
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:42.880]  mean you're a monster she's got a trail of death behind her they fire people that
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:47.600]  say she needs medical help like dr. Drew of course I'm pointing out we're in
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:52.840]  danger and if I do get killed she's the number one suspect and see I ruin your
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:56.240]  fun because other people are supposed to just sit there and cower but never say
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:15:02.280]  it I don't care lady I don't care what you say about me I love a thousand
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:06.400]  articles a day attacking me I love a traitor like you attacking me it's the
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:10.560]  most beautiful music I ever heard sweetheart
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:16.560]  but you're right because you know it I will be around just as long as God wants
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:21.920]  me to I ignored it for a long time the providence in my life but I tell you my
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:25.520]  entire life people to double-cross me your enemies that come after me they've
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:32.600]  never had a good fate and it wasn't men doing it and that's what you can't stand
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:36.920]  can you that there's something bigger than you and your satanic new world order
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:42.160]  there's a whole universe around this little planet and it's run by God big G
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:47.760]  OD exclamation point and it's the God that gave us all this prosperity all this
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:54.120]  life men and women loving each other children all these blessings and you are
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:57.800]  only the test for us you know the next level so I thank God for the persecution
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:01.560]  I thank God for everything's I will not get mad at God if I lose everything
[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:07.160]  tomorrow everything my family everything I'm committed don't you get it lady I
[02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:15.360]  love God you don't it's over the tanks are rolling into Berlin lady you're
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:23.200]  going to get it politically understand you already lost so act all powerful and
[02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:28.560]  act like you're invincible all day long lady you don't have any spirit and you
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:33.600]  know it and I guess you have understanding you don't back to Rachel
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:40.120]  Maddow off the fringe and became bigger fringe when he proclaimed that 9-11 was
[02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:44.760]  not carried out by Al Qaeda 9-11 was actually committed by the US government
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:51.200]  against our own country again I pointed out the Saudi Arabia working with
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:54.080]  criminal elements of our government and the car law group was clearly involved
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:58.040]  was a standout interview the FBI agents CIA you name it broke it all down and

[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:07.960]  continue he earned from that 9-11 truth or ism and he has now been running with
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:11.720]  it and expanding on that idea very successfully for the last 15 years and
[02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:15.480]  you sometimes have people ask especially people in other countries will look at
[02:17:15.480 --> 02:17:19.440]  the American electorate now ask in very sort of serious sociological or
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:24.480]  poli-side terms it wasn't there was like that like foreigners are all smarter
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:28.520]  than us and we're also stupid we were kind of in our own bubble and it is true
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:31.840]  but the target of the global's takeover so we do have some problems but oh all
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:37.160]  these pseudo-intellectuals and poli-size and adjuprops and you know oh so fancy

[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:45.680]  know we're intellectuals you know when you've hit your wagon to a corpse like
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:54.120]  Hillary you're a joke lady I mean I've been around some of these globalists
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:56.680]  some of these meetings and events over the years and they're the most empty
[02:17:56.680 --> 02:18:02.440]  unhappy neurotic screwed up weirdos I mean I would want to hang around with you
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:12.840]  if hell froze over but you think you're elitist no you're the trash that the
[02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:19.120]  evil spiders of the New World Order put in charge because you're so traitorous

[02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:29.880]  to your fellow humans and get off on pissing on everybody we're gonna skip
[02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:32.640]  this network break this is so important let's continue with Rachel Maddow and
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:36.880]  by the way if you're a radio listener she has an image of myself Donald Trump
[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:43.200]  and Putin up there this is the new normal God forbid Putin pay people to get
[02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:46.000]  married and have kids because the Russians are all dying God forbid Trump
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.760]  let's do the same thing God forbid I don't want GMOs and God forbid Trump's
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:53.720]  exposing that gets no money from Big Pharma and that they're making the new
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:59.760]  national export from Russia organic food oh my gosh this is so horrible God
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:04.560]  forbid Putin battle radical Islamists all over the world God forbid Trump link
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:09.960]  up with Russia God forbid we not bankrupt ourselves with all these wars and
[02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:14.000]  their new McCarthyism when McCarthy was right about how the globals were running
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.920]  Russia but it wasn't Russia taking us over it was the globalist taking Russia
[02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:19.960]  over that's what I took my card yeah they call the new McCarthyism that's not
[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:25.280]  fair this is 50 times beyond that I mean they've got national newscast every day
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:31.040]  literally saying I'm a Russian agent because I know George Soros bragged on
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:34.560]  CNN he started a war with an elected government over through the Ukrainian
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:39.080]  government it's trying to start a war with Russia some weirdo that my
[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:43.760]  grandfathers who are both dead in their graves my grand mom's dad gave them
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:48.800]  something medical science with others dead in the grave in Tick Texas and it's
[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:54.400]  not fair that this Nazi collaborator a master Nazi is running around with all
[02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:58.680]  these weird liberals with big long draft necks like this science fiction like
[02:19:58.680 --> 02:20:03.360]  what the hell's going on like worshiping real Nazis and then calling me one it's
[02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:08.400]  like what is your problem man why are you so scumbag-ish why are you so
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:12.520]  fraudulent why are you so fake what the hell is your problem I can't believe
[02:20:12.520 --> 02:20:23.720]  you're so weak it's your followers you come from families of trash it really
[02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:27.240]  comes down to that and it's those of us that don't come from trash who are to
[02:20:27.240 --> 02:20:30.480]  blame for letting you do this well guess what we're not gonna let you anymore
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:36.760]  and so you're gonna feel our will pressing against you 24 seven hours a
[02:20:36.760 --> 02:20:45.680]  day at every level economically culturally spiritually militarily every
[02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:50.880]  hour every day every millisecond pounding you with the truth focusing on
[02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:57.200]  you we have the will we are the future you have already fallen you are falling
[02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:04.920]  go back to hell go back to your God get behind me Satan now back to Rachel
[02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:09.040]  Maddow that an advanced and fairly well-educated country like ours is
[02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:13.680]  nevertheless getting to be as susceptible to political conspiracy
[02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:19.240]  theories as broadly uneducated countries in faraway lands why is it that
[02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:25.040]  we get more Americans are dumb scum when her viewers we've talked to the street
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:29.360]  cannot find their butts with both hands I mean again it's all how she's this big
[02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:33.360]  intellectual oh there's the Federal Reserve's not private everything's fine
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:37.720]  let's go back to her more susceptible conspiracy theories as
[02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:41.960]  susceptible consider the conspiracy theories as time goes on we don't seem
[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:45.280]  like the kind of country where they would have as much traction as they do now
[02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:51.440]  in our contemporary era yes the AP and others admit you have a 6% trust
[02:21:51.440 --> 02:21:56.240]  rate you've lost all credibility does that mean everything that people put out
[02:21:56.240 --> 02:21:59.120]  against you or questions we have is completely accurate no we're trying to
[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:04.880]  be accurate but you're known discredited two weeks ago trash already at the
[02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:09.360]  landfill sweetheart we're the new little flowers in the spring time come up out
[02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:13.680]  of the grass baby it's up to us to lose the future and I don't want to lose the
[02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:18.440]  future I have good will towards people you don't you bloated parasite every
[02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:23.320]  place globalist run turns into a poor squalor-filled hellhole because you're
[02:22:23.320 --> 02:22:26.720]  demons and don't like to see prosperity you want to see a bunch of poor people
[02:22:26.720 --> 02:22:30.520]  you rule over you're a feudal lord
[02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:35.960]  the name is good as old feudal lords who are willing to fight for their slaves
[02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:43.360]  you're all bark and no bite all hat and no cattle all talk and no action let's go
[02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:48.440]  back to Chris says part of the reason why we're so susceptible to conspiracy
[02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:52.960]  theories right now is that guys like Alex Jones make a ton of money circulating
[02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:58.520]  them as widely as they possibly can this is this is class envy they get
[02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:02.320]  billions in taxpayer money when NBC still owned it a few years ago she even
[02:23:02.320 --> 02:23:05.760]  got a bonus off your taxpayer money NPR gets it these big corporations get
[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:09.800]  corporate welfare they run these media outlets it losses to spew their
[02:23:09.800 --> 02:23:13.760]  disinformation they're anti-gun they're anti-christian crap ban the founding
[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:18.600]  fathers get rid of the American flag all this stuff and then we're bad that
[02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:22.440]  we're here in Texas selling t-shirts and books and videos and
[02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:28.240]  nutraceuticals we're evil because we make money but she cuts to commercial in
[02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:37.000]  a few minutes with where they're making money no credibility hypocrites the
[02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:42.000]  obvious paradox she thinks her viewers are idiots and a lot of more they're
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:47.720]  sitting there listening and feeling intellectual and feeling powerful as
[02:23:47.720 --> 02:23:55.840]  their god this weird asexual android arrogantly sits there in a con game
[02:23:55.840 --> 02:24:00.520]  smiling like she runs the planet when I guarantee you Rachel Maddow is a miserable
[02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:07.720]  miserable person you could not pay me a billion dollars to spend one week with
[02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:12.360]  her let's continue and they use multiple platforms they use talk radio and the
[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:16.480]  internet and they live stream their kind of fake TV shows and they make a very
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:20.960]  good living doing it and they're gonna be around because of it for a long time
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:24.840]  and usually this kind of stuff has no major effect on the United States of
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:30.440]  America other than lowering our median IQ again you're stupid we lower the
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:35.000]  IQ we're dumb down media even though it's complex historical analysis which
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.440]  you think your audience doesn't get so you dumb it down and then pray on them
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:45.520]  when they're when when we are the organic response to your technocracy and you
[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:48.560]  say normally this doesn't have any effect on the United States it's having a
[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:54.280]  total effect let me give you a little headline sweet tart I knew 15 years ago
[02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:58.280]  when you kept was getting no attention and I was having Nigel Farage on every
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:02.280]  month that he was telling me and he said it on air that the majority of the new
[02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:09.000]  UKIP members they got were from this show sweet art just the sidewash of this
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:19.640]  broadcast just blew holes in the EU and that was 15 years ago baby so you sit
[02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:22.760]  there and talk about how we don't have any influence when you realize you're
[02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:27.520]  covering it every night because we've devastated you and we're gonna go on
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:41.360]  devastating you you took our restraint as weakness you took our calm as support
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:47.840]  for what you're doing and and it's it that's not what it is and now you're
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:51.160]  beginning to see the preparations we've made we have preparations for every
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:58.160]  eventuality you launch and I'm not talking about little me I'm just a focal
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:10.520]  point that's it kind of a stream of the resistance an oracle for all the
[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:20.160]  patriots and the news and the information and what you're noticing is when
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:25.440]  you try to cut us down you make us a thousand times more powerful each time
[02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:33.920]  and just as trash like you has learned throughout history you're weak now back
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:37.920]  to the panicking metal and making us seem slightly more embarrassing on an
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:41.560]  international stage right for every additional year they circulate their
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:47.200]  insane alien lizard people theories of everything I don't cover the alien
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:50.520]  lizard thing I've had guests on that say it's like demons run things why the
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:53.720]  British Royals always caught with dead kids what the hell's going on and he's
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:56.240]  sort of the elite they're in all sorts of whacked out stuff I mean I'm not the
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:27:01.360]  one that's going bones that has gay sex in giant pits of feces that's movies
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:06.520]  that are admittedly history produced and starred in with Matt Damon and Robert
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:11.680]  De Niro you know the the good shepherd I mean I'm not the one worshiping Satan
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:16.500]  in pits of feces lady all I'm saying is you people are crazy like
[02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:22.440]  Collegial Mary and his horse making it the head of the Senate that's all I'm
[02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:29.720]  saying and our audience knows that sweet sweet sweet pie a bit dumber and
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:33.240]  that's the major effect it has on the United States of America but this year
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:39.480]  is different because this year that little corner that little niche let's
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:43.040]  get by backing up they know Trump by the way it's like 15 points has why they're
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:45.440]  so panicking right now they don't know what to do they know he's gonna challenge
[02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:48.960]  us to an election so they send the feds in and take it over the globalist and
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:52.280]  notice how they use all these videos that aren't even that blurred on YouTube
[02:27:52.280 --> 02:27:55.800]  they use like five six seven-year-old stuff ten-year-old stuff and then I know
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:59.280]  those videos they're not that blur they blur them on purpose to make it look
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:04.640]  like it's this horrible low quality crap when I've actually found without being
[02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:08.240]  manipulative people like grainy stuff better than crystal clear because
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:12.480]  crystal clear is so associated with you so at every level they're there going
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:16.680]  we'll blur it out and make you look bad and blow up the screen I can look fat
[02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:20.360]  I mean all the tricks are playing we don't use those tricks but we're too
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:23.520]  busy just spewing truth that you like a giant flamethrower but but this is what
[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:27.960]  they're doing if you're a TV viewer you can see this it's a joke but oh let's go
[02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:31.840]  back to the crystal clear I wish it wasn't of the giraffe neck here it is
[02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:37.280]  States of America but this year is different because this year that little
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:44.160]  corner that little niche of organized and profitable American insanity so
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:47.800]  fearful this year they're out of their corner because this year their
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:53.920]  presidential politics after NBC and MSNBC and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of
[02:28:53.920 --> 02:28:56.880]  America hosted the Commander-in-Chief Forum last night with Hillary Clinton
[02:28:56.880 --> 02:29:03.840]  and Donald Trump after that last night this morning Donald Trump Jr. woke up
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:11.120]  and tweeted this direct hit pause I'll explain this works okay whatever they're
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:15.760]  most fearful of they act like they've got you so that weak members of the
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:19.960]  campaign go oh my god Trump they're really going after us on this and Trump's
[02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:23.560]  been in the meetings he goes that's exactly what we want attack more on that
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:29.360]  he gets it they want to set the parameters of the debate where oh my god
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:33.760]  Hillary's health it's totally discredited she's healthier than Muhammad Ali
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:38.600]  when he's 25 years old you know she can run a marathon right now you know in her
[02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:43.240]  sleep and do jumping jacks backwards oh Trump you're discredited putting this
[02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:46.880]  earpiece thing out oh my god you're in so much trouble because that's what
[02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:55.120]  they're scared of folks we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[02:29:55.120 --> 02:30:04.080]  and the GCN radio network article up by campus reform tampons coming to men's
[02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:08.240]  rooms at Brown University that's right Brown University student body
[02:30:08.240 --> 02:30:12.480]  president will be hand delivering minstrel products to all non-residential
[02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:16.480]  bathrooms on campus including men's rooms with the help of 20 other students
[02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:19.880]  the president the undergraduate council students announce the initiative in a
[02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:24.280]  campus-wide email Tuesday saying he wants to communicate the message that not all
[02:30:24.280 --> 02:30:29.080]  people who menstruate are women haha there's been a lot of conversation about
[02:30:29.080 --> 02:30:33.520]  why pads and tampons are a necessity not a luxury but not a lot of action we
[02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:37.440]  wanted to take it into our own hands says the president low-income students
[02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:41.200]  struggle with having the necessary funding for food let alone tampons by
[02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:45.200]  putting minstrel products in women's and men's and gender exclusive bathrooms he
[02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:49.200]  has set a tone of trans inclusivity and will not forget that they're an
[02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:53.440]  important part of the population but is under no illusions that the effort will
[02:30:53.440 --> 02:30:58.640]  be universally popular yeah because men don't menstruate you can find more

[02:33:28.160 --> 02:33:34.160]  but time went by and I found out a thing or two
[02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:38.160]  my shine wore off as time wore on
[02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:43.640]  yeah Hillary shine has worn off as time wears on and we've got the video about
[02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:49.920]  info wars.com where they've got her in this tent for like 45 minutes a couple

[02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:12.600]  get Business Insider you'll get the actual studies I mean I'm not the one
[02:35:12.600 --> 02:35:18.320]  saying this it's like a big deal I take it every day I can't say well let's kick
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:21.880]  his mic on if we can yeah Rob is here where the glad they put in the they
[02:35:21.880 --> 02:35:24.800]  make it in these big glass vats it's all done with glass it's not done with
[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:28.040]  plastic I've seen the crystals they they keep them in a vault because the stuff
[02:35:28.040 --> 02:35:34.680]  is is it you know it can't be dangerous and so we have to under yeah what is it
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:39.240]  the Drug Enforcement Agency right exactly it's a cuz they use to make a
[02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:42.680]  bunch of drugs yeah exactly but you know when we took it out one drop he's
[02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:45.840]  through like the floor like alien yeah they put it on the hot plate and just a
[02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:48.720]  little bit of heat applied underneath it and the fumes start coming up this
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:52.560]  stuff purple powerful and when you take it you'll taste the power in it I mean
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:56.000]  you could taste you know you know when you get something that's like really
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:59.720]  salty or brine you eat seaweed it's got that power in it you can just feel it
[02:35:59.720 --> 02:36:03.080]  this is the same way absolutely I mean to get off into a whole thing about that
[02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:06.120]  but they don't normally cover Maddow she attacks us pretty much every day now
[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:10.640]  yeah I mean it's four or five times a week but this is this long diatribe of
[02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:15.400]  disinfo they're all about who controls the narrative and who listens to who and
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:19.000]  I mean they're such fatality and oh and we're lowering the IQ of people she
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:24.960]  doesn't even know what a zealite is she has no idea it's things that take
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:30.120]  toxins out of your body you know you need this stuff people don't realize and
[02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:35.440]  and they and what do they push they push pharmaceutical products they these
[02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:38.880]  crappy weight loss pills that don't work and that are filled with garbage
[02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:42.640]  that's the kind of stuff they throw out at their listeners and they think their
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:45.680]  listeners are their listeners think they're smart because they watch those
[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:48.520]  programs let me ask you this question really is a program what they do it's
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:52.360]  all about group think yeah it's all peer pressure like that email you got
[02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:56.840]  today oh yeah from the yeah Chicago rain rider we're like okay you're saying the
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:36:59.800]  devil incarnate come on the show yeah I would never do that you have no
[02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:03.760]  credibility it's like like he has this power to say you don't even know who you
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:08.380]  are age relics is probably Carl the cock have all been offered 10 grand a
[02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:14.920]  piece I wish they would it'd be great they're just scared yeah there they're
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:18.280]  afraid and that's how it that's how it is there are for what you challenge
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:21.720]  once you challenge them on one thing they literally just start freaking out
[02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:25.080]  I've been to these Trump rallies you ask them a couple questions oh they just
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:30.000]  start and by the way I'm not scared of the media that I've turned on 20 something
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:33.120]  major profiles I said no I'll give you all 15 minutes on the phone I ask your
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:36.520]  questions or you can all come here into a press conference yeah but I'm not gonna
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:41.400]  sit there and spend you know 20 days not running our operation or do it in person
[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:44.800]  to sit there and kiss the ass of some reporter yeah who's gonna then put out
[02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:48.280]  some disinfo piece I just write whatever your crap is notice how and in
[02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:52.840]  Madhouse piece they took stuff from like 2010 2011 they find the oldest stuff when
[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:57.320]  we're in the old studio I know they found some stuff like 2009 2008 and it's
[02:37:57.320 --> 02:37:59.880]  just but it's not even point is they even blurred that to make it all look
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:04.640]  crazy right they messed the audio up it's like yeah we got to put the filters
[02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:10.200]  on it and it's just funny the way they attack you constantly and but each attack
[02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:13.760]  you grow stronger we all go stronger but the point is is that because they're
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:17.440]  discredited and they still don't get their discredited no they don't they
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:20.200]  think they think their narrative is what everybody goes with and their narrative
[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:24.320]  is the one that's not trusted by anybody except those old geriatric people who
[02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:27.880]  believe that what comes on TV is the truth all right let's let's let's finish
[02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:31.160]  up with matter I'll try not to comment too much Sunday if this flu news and Paul
[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:35.040]  Lawson's got a new article about the truth about Hillary's handler it's very powerful
[02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:39.600]  we also want to play some clips of her Hillary and the emergency stretcher and
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:43.280]  her in a medical tent for 45 minutes you imagine if Trump was in a medical
[02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:48.440]  oh there it would be national news every day of the week for two weeks straight
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:52.480]  I mean she clearly looks like she's dying and those guys are wearing body armor you
[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:57.520]  can see the picture on info wars.com you can see the men three men pushing the
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:39:02.240]  gurney and they're they have body armor on. All right let's go back to Chris
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:10.560]  Hayes here it is. And tweeted this direct link to the Alex Jones info wars
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:16.200]  expose of what really happened on board the Intrepid last night at the Commander
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:20.680]  and Chief Forum you got to hit the shift lock key because it's all in capital
[02:39:20.680 --> 02:39:24.760]  letters when you get there but what he's linked to is this info wars Alex Jones
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:30.240]  piece was Hillary wearing an earpiece during last night's presidential forum
[02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:34.560]  this is an Alex Jones info wars conspiracy theory exclusive they took a
[02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:38.520]  screen grab from last night's commander in chief forum that you know with the
[02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:43.160]  light hitting Hillary Clinton's left ear just exactly in the right way it
[02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:48.400]  appears to show some sort of suspicious glare in that if you wanted to take this
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:52.680]  accusation seriously that she was wearing an earpiece you know she was on
[02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:57.280]  stage for more than 20 minutes you could take lots of different angles showing
[02:39:57.280 --> 02:40:01.880]  the same ear without the glint by the way we've caught them blurring out down
[02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:06.120]  from support shirts we've caught them editing things cutting feeds constantly
[02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:10.360]  why wouldn't they follow the shop out stuff oh yeah exactly the web was
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:13.720]  exploding with this earpiece thing we didn't break this right and I'm not
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:17.160]  backing away from it I said as you were an earpiece we said about George W. Bush
[02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:21.160]  he clearly had the whole back and I had the whole deal I mean look here we don't
[02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:25.000]  believe known liars right and Hillary it's not like she was five years ago when
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:28.240]  she was still all there she's got to have secret service and doctors run up when
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:31.760]  somebody asked her a question she's like spaces out it's okay it's okay and she's
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:35.360]  not have somebody tell her it's okay so and then you got to my abidings email
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:38.840]  saying do you need your earpiece I mean it's WikiLeaks you can even see it when
[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:42.120]  Richard Reeves asked her the question about the emails being hacked her email
[02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:44.560]  being hanged she was absolutely not absolutely not and then she and then the
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:47.280]  guys like all right come on and they say come on here we go she was here we go
[02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:51.440]  it's like she's a little we should put all that it is like she's my control
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:55.080]  or as he starts walking with us yeah yeah we should show all that cuz it's
[02:40:55.080 --> 02:40:58.320]  like they should be like foot they go it's okay go forward I won't go far
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:01.960]  right I won't go far right exactly and then everybody went oh look at Jones
[02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:04.980]  claiming they were hacked it was admittedly hacked months before Richard
[02:41:04.980 --> 02:41:08.640]  Reeves asked the question yes he just admitted at the forum two nights ago that
[02:41:08.640 --> 02:41:13.000]  it was hacked right admittedly hacked a year ago we got her like the point is
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:17.880]  just oh we're discredited again Rachel Maddow said right yeah all right let's go
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:22.880]  back to I'm gonna be honest I'm not attracted to men but I'm becoming a
[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:28.240]  little bit gay for Rachel Maddow here it is right here are other images of
[02:41:28.240 --> 02:41:31.960]  Hillary Clinton's ear the ear in question from the same event last night
[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:37.600]  none of which show the secret earpiece that Alex Jones has exposed see the
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:44.720]  ear it had the little angles on it where it looks like it was messed with I
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:48.200]  was about to say you're did we didn't script this you're looking at that
[02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:52.840]  there's suddenly more pixelation even that lazy to start to look at Obama's
[02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:57.400]  birth certificate was in six layers and he's word pressed right and my
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:01.600]  thoughts were that where it's like blobs from a printer but the C's are all the
[02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:04.480]  same every time they're different yeah like a snowflake with how you hit the
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:09.200]  key and then it's just it's crazy I mean I don't even know what to say you use
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:14.520]  Microsoft Word on it with a typewriter fine it wasn't real I don't know what
[02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:18.960]  you're hiding I don't know what's going on but you don't put things out in six
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:23.400]  layers I mean they put them out of the layers they don't even flatten the
[02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:27.480]  product or jury that don't even flatten the project right exactly let's back
[02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:31.880]  that up your TV viewer that you're on to something here it's blurred all right so
[02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:35.600]  go forward in that this is crazy these people are not slowly scroll forward you
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:38.720]  can see one of the ear shots that when she says these are all the the angles
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:43.040]  that it wasn't there they're just targeting morons that I think it was
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:46.200]  that one right there look at the air can blow it up your full screen that it's
[02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:51.200]  clearly pixelated right there yeah look at that oh my god it's worse like this
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:53.640]  one's kind you can see the edge of her nose and it's kind of pixelated but look
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:57.960]  at the ear mega pixelation right there which means you bought it you can see it
[02:42:57.960 --> 02:43:01.800]  these people they're still into these people my god it is like this is like
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:05.080]  wow and I wasn't even sure she had earpiece but look at this look at the
[02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:09.960]  freaking out wow that's a I do know this is 45 minutes in a tent everybody
[02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:13.760]  freaking out and people running up in body armor was stretchers like the world
[02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:18.960]  was ending yeah she's all and then you got what about the green globlets coming
[02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:22.800]  up I've never seen any cough drops that big well we we know what that is and we
[02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:26.560]  we've already shown it we have the video for her baby Maddox coming up this is
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:30.240]  the creeps come that's all but Maddox mates yeah we actually had the microphone
[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:34.240]  we tune the microphones you actually hear them talking as they come out we're
[02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:37.360]  being sarcastic there Maddox we're not talking bad about your mating rituals
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:42.920]  back I'll bet I bet Hillary is a fan of Maddox oh yeah I wonder if Maddox ever
[02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:47.200]  ever stayed in the same hotel room like umma umma umma yeah well they they take
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:51.040]  off a couple floors so there's always time to put somebody else in there who
[02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:57.960]  knows that's a party hey let's go back to Chris Hayes go ahead and from the same
[02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:01.920]  event last night none of which show the secret earpiece that Alex Jones has
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:07.920]  exposed but I mean consider the source here consider the context this earpiece
[02:44:07.920 --> 02:44:11.560]  story at Alex Jones info wars right it's literally running alongside other
[02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:14.520]  headlines that are up at that same website today that say that Hillary
[02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:18.480]  Clinton uses a wheelchair that she has Parkinson's disease info wars also
[02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:21.560]  announcing today that they've got the video proof that Hillary Clinton is a
[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:27.240]  mass murderer so you know there's a secret earpiece thing you know it's
[02:44:27.240 --> 02:44:33.360]  that's a journalist she admits that she quote launched the failed policy of the
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:37.280]  failed set of Libya that's killed close to 100,000 people she admits she's the
[02:44:37.280 --> 02:44:40.160]  author of what happened in Syria everybody knows that top generals are all
[02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:44.400]  saying and she just hopes her audience into bombing Yugoslavia the second time
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:48.000]  which was even more bombs in the first time which to back up the Muslims taking
[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:52.840]  over let's go back to her compared to the rest of the stuff they're putting out
[02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:59.120]  there the only backed all the Iraq attacks for no reason back it up and
[02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:02.560]  the sanctions that killed 500,000 Iraqis right that her mentor says was a good
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:09.920]  price to pay exactly 500 man I was like my Adam's apple is bigger than yours Alex

[02:45:18.240 --> 02:45:23.680]  there that could be sort of a mainstream scandal I mean this year in 2016 with
[02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:27.960]  Donald Trump at the top of the ticket for the Republican Party it really could
[02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:31.160]  it could be mainstream she's a warmonger yeah it could be mainstream is she
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:36.160]  backed Al Qaeda ISIS that's all admitted facts we came we saw he died she says it
[02:45:36.160 --> 02:45:48.760]  right there and you got to do a hyena laugh though excuse me like war with

[02:46:02.360 --> 02:46:05.600]  predict now she'll never have a clear glass again it'll there always be like
[02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:09.680]  some sort of you know it'll be I'm telling we got to take memes of that we
[02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:13.840]  got to take like you know those little seven-second bills oh yeah yeah well we
[02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:20.400]  have one there are no green globules we're all Obama cares free bro I didn't
[02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:24.640]  have sex with that why didn't have sexual green globlets let's go back to our
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:30.480]  sweetheart Matt out here it is Alex Jones is no longer just broadcasting to
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:35.840]  your fillings in your molars it was mm-hmm so we're we never talked about broadcasting
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:39.360]  people's molars it's just more crap like you said I once said there were giant
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:42.800]  wasps live under the U.N. building and run everything but actually people do get
[02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:45.960]  radio signals in their molars that has happened because it well yeah that's
[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:50.040]  even that's even been like a time magazine decades ago that it was true
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:53.760]  that so somehow that was close enough to the transmitter yeah sometimes it would
[02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:56.440]  resonate you would hear like a little mirror here in your mouth and it's
[02:46:56.440 --> 02:46:59.760]  that's a dentist joke actually it's like a common knowledge dentist your dad
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:03.600]  probably even heard you know hey if you turn your head this way but the point is
[02:47:03.600 --> 02:47:08.760]  we're not saying that yeah exactly okay let's go back to her this he is
[02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:13.080]  apparently with the upper echelons of the Republican presidential campaign is
[02:47:13.080 --> 02:47:19.080]  reading and citing and circulating even at this late date in the campaign and it
[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:23.600]  matters because it's not just the kook fringe it's not just the sort of
[02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:28.480]  remunerative conspiracy theory world of that part of the conservative media
[02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:32.240]  machine it's not even just wacky people who have made their way into
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:35.400]  Republican politics at a surprising height this is now the top of the
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:44.760]  Republican ticket I'm back around Republicans on average we've got some
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:48.360]  idiot people yeah they wanted to attack Iraq I'm like hey it's Saudi Arabia and
[02:47:48.360 --> 02:47:52.160]  you're out shut up traitor call me where you hit me but I mean I got on
[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:55.680]  Democrats on average you've been doing this a long time tell me the wrong are
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:47:59.760]  they not on average the dumbest people you've ever seen the island will tilt if
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:04.400]  too many people get on the admiral if some people get on the island of Guam
[02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:14.880]  will it tip over floating I mean this is it really is bizarre oh man let's go
[02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:19.320]  back to low information voter queen yeah or should I say King I'm out out here
[02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:24.280]  this did the info wars Alex Jones conspiracy theory all day today this was
[02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:27.280]  the headline about the commander-in-chief forum at the negative mega
[02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:30.880]  conservative news site that drives more traffic online than anything else on the
[02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:34.360]  right this was the headline all day today at the judge reports back up again
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:38.080]  all lies if you keep doing it I'm sorry singing an hour to do drudge has more
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:43.280]  traffic than the New York Times Facebook both combined that's admitted even by
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:47.560]  the New York Times she says oh more traffic than the right yeah lady you
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:53.760]  don't even show up as a blip on the radar screen I mean you are a joke we
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:57.640]  don't even cover you but one out of 20 times it's just you are you're so
[02:48:57.640 --> 02:49:01.320]  comical we've got to get their biggest audience of her life right now yeah it's
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:04.800]  like the young turds I gotta their show is imploding less and less viewers
[02:49:04.800 --> 02:49:08.080]  everything and they just go go Alex wanted to come on here because he needed
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:11.240]  an audience he's desperate yeah they're like hey Alex please come on like I'll
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:17.360]  be back later he's just that they're a joke you're a joke here here let's go
[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:22.480]  back to her they literally led with this as the most important thing in
[02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:27.040]  presidential politics right now I think it's pretty which on the one hand is
[02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:31.840]  hilarious right on the other hand this is this great moment this is like a
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:39.720]  snapshot microcosm of why this campaign is hard to follow sort of why it's hard
[02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:43.840]  to get a sense of what the narrative is of the campaign sort of maddening to
[02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:46.920]  try to follow what's going on in the campaign
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:50.080]  ridiculous to try to follow what's going on in the campaign on any given day
[02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:55.120]  now it's because there really are just these two sides in the campaign we are
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:50:01.120]  in a presidential election contest we have two major parties I have nothing
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:03.760]  against lesbians okay I mean seriously I don't need to say I don't have any
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:09.840]  it's lesbians I don't I mean I literally don't I don't whatever I mean I'll judge
[02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:16.720]  it I think I got good taste the point is is that she's the god of lesbians though
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:20.760]  I mean Hillary is it's like that's it's well known it's like they'll defend her
[02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:24.680]  no matter what she does he's got vomiting globulets up and has ambulance is
[02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:27.640]  falling around and she's falling over and there's a guy with an epi pin I mean
[02:50:27.640 --> 02:50:32.040]  this can't go on much longer this is so biblical that she's rotting right in
[02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:35.840]  front of a spin reality and we saw that at at the convention the Democratic
[02:50:35.840 --> 02:50:38.480]  National Convention these people were like I don't like that sure but there's a
[02:50:38.480 --> 02:50:43.360]  place for you in our party well what about the stolen emails what about the
[02:50:43.360 --> 02:50:47.880]  hacked emails that say she was they were literally giving it to her well you know
[02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:51.600]  that's not good but we still got a support well it's okay that she's a
[02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:55.120]  warmonger and a criminal and saw the Communist Chinese because she's a woman
[02:50:55.120 --> 02:50:59.520]  it's like no that's bad you just don't like a woman and I'm like I'm gonna
[02:50:59.520 --> 02:51:03.240]  respond to that at this point you know you don't like her she's a lesbian I
[02:51:03.240 --> 02:51:07.440]  mean she admittedly had a reportedly a boy and they don't want a boy we better
[02:51:07.440 --> 02:51:12.280]  have a girl aboard it just just had a girl just for PR purposes yeah I mean
[02:51:12.280 --> 02:51:15.080]  this is just these people are anti-human folks I don't know what else to say
[02:51:15.080 --> 02:51:21.960]  about you know it's just their trash and and and I gotta tell you this is
[02:51:21.960 --> 02:51:27.040]  historic what's happening these people are floundering mm-hmm it the last three
[02:51:27.040 --> 02:51:30.920]  months have really just illustrated everything they say turns out to be a
[02:51:30.920 --> 02:51:33.880]  lie it's gonna come out eventually that she had something in her ear get an
[02:51:33.880 --> 02:51:37.320]  earpiece in her ear it's gonna come out that she's had all these brain serves
[02:51:37.320 --> 02:51:40.880]  recently no she's had them it's gonna come out she's got Parkinson's she's
[02:51:40.880 --> 02:51:43.840]  get she goes I need Parkinson's medication in the damn email I mean you
[02:51:43.840 --> 02:51:47.840]  know I mean it's gonna come out the symptoms of Parkinson's means you have
[02:51:47.840 --> 02:51:50.800]  Parkinson's and we're not even saying she has Parkinson's we're just asking the
[02:51:50.800 --> 02:51:54.280]  question because but Dr. Drew wanted to help her so he got fired let's finish
[02:51:54.280 --> 02:51:58.280]  up man I'm gonna get to this really we have a piece 40s technology here it is
[02:51:58.280 --> 02:52:03.440]  campaign on any given day now it's because there really are just these two
[02:52:03.440 --> 02:52:06.760]  sides in the campaign we are in a presidential election contest we have
[02:52:06.760 --> 02:52:10.920]  two major parties and these are the two candidates for those parties and it just
[02:52:10.920 --> 02:52:16.840]  so happens that one of them is stuck on the juice boxes make you gay channel and
[02:52:16.840 --> 02:52:21.480]  the other one is nevertheless trying to conduct a campaign as if this is normal
[02:52:21.480 --> 02:52:24.440]  policy so better looking these are not two campaigns that are doing the same
[02:52:24.440 --> 02:52:28.560]  thing these are not two candidates who are making the same kind of case these
[02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:31.920]  are not two political organizations that are even speaking the same language I
[02:52:31.920 --> 02:52:36.720]  mean one side is literally treating info wars which believes that invisible
[02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:43.880]  alien lizard people drive most u.s. policy hit pause you bought the Zwork is
[02:52:43.880 --> 02:52:48.520]  his name yeah it was one it was something from a Star Trek Zwork right I
[02:52:48.520 --> 02:52:52.760]  think so there's an extinct volcano and my son like the gorm or something gorm
[02:52:52.760 --> 02:52:55.880]  there's an extinct volcano outside town like the same place they shot the
[02:52:55.880 --> 02:52:59.640]  famous one refights the lizard he invents a cannon dish he like makes a
[02:52:59.640 --> 02:53:02.600]  cannon out exactly so I said I wanted to make a joke video out of that but we
[02:53:02.600 --> 02:53:06.600]  never did it right and as I was with Captain Kirk and like each war but we
[02:53:06.600 --> 02:53:10.000]  didn't do it so then I just made a joke where I was like talking about how
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:14.600]  Obamacare is free and wonderful it's a joke video I'm not saying Lizard aliens
[02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:18.000]  are on I did it as a joke the people that are into the Lizard aliens people got
[02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:22.640]  mad at me it's satire I said it was satire you can't take when I do satire
[02:53:22.640 --> 02:53:26.240]  and then say it's real right like I don't really think you're Chris Hayes you're
[02:53:26.240 --> 02:53:29.720]  not you know as good looking as she is let's let's go back to the tape here it
[02:53:29.720 --> 02:53:34.840]  is Wars Internet TV show this is for the skeptics out there who don't believe
[02:53:34.840 --> 02:53:38.680]  there really are alien lizard people out there who are moving among us mostly
[02:53:38.680 --> 02:53:42.720]  invisible secretly controlling American policy in order to demonstrate their
[02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:47.720]  influence they dress up as alien lizard people at info wars calm to show you the
[02:53:47.720 --> 02:53:52.080]  effect are having on the United States government so you can recognize their
[02:53:52.080 --> 02:53:56.440]  work when they surface among us even though most of us can't see them some
[02:53:56.440 --> 02:54:03.000]  of us can see them I'll say boss it's clearly satire she knows that she doesn't
[02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:07.360]  play the audio of what I'm saying it's me and a lizard hat
[02:54:07.360 --> 02:54:10.520]  making fun of Obamacare I think is what you're doing with a top hat on yeah
[02:54:10.520 --> 02:54:16.520]  making a joke okay and she knows that but she thinks her viewers are idiots
[02:54:16.520 --> 02:54:22.280]  which there aren't many of them left but you know I guess they are or that you
[02:54:22.280 --> 02:54:31.600]  didn't for comedy let's finish up with a maddo that's one side in what is
[02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:36.400]  supposed to be a contest between two equally feasible political choices to
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:39.040]  be the leader of the free world commander-in-chief and president of the
[02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:42.320]  United States how about make you the commander and what we're going to talk
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:48.560]  about tonight is if you are the other side what do you do with that
[02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:57.000]  hey there I'm Chris hey there I mean if you read every article it's like don't
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:00.880]  listen to them you're not allowed to it's cookie we define the rules yeah don't
[02:55:00.880 --> 02:55:06.000]  you cooks get it the con games over sweetheart and I'm just here as a shock

[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:14.360]  right behind me yeah I haven't figured this out yet if they do because they're
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:17.800]  all about yourself said a little maggots and I don't care what happens to me
[02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:21.800]  dumbass there's people working in that organization to an MSNBC that are
[02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:25.400]  probably real patriots and let stuff out like you know say the Reuters guy who
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:28.960]  wouldn't we know they like that stuff yeah or when in CNN when they find the
[02:55:28.960 --> 02:55:31.880]  black guy I think it was CNN they find the black guy at the Trump rally and
[02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:35.840]  he's like I think we all got to come together look well obviously not every
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:40.120]  black person there likes well God what do we do somebody just said something
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:44.000]  normal you know we can't we can't spin this and it's just so funny watching
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:48.640]  them flounder issue after issue after they're they're here to divide us talk
[02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:52.800]  about our health they're here to do all this crap to us and and they just spin
[02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:56.040]  every side I mean it's like Trump always said we're gonna make it easier if
[02:55:56.040 --> 02:55:59.360]  you've got a good record and you want a job to come here because we've you know
[02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:04.080]  we need workers in America but if you're a felon like the guy in Austin that
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:07.800]  raped five women was deported over and over again and was caught raping again
[02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:11.560]  I mean he shouldn't get deported execute the son of a bitch after three
[02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:16.920]  rapes yeah I mean I got daughters here man we've had quite frankly people in
[02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:19.200]  this office have had folks connected to him right recently I mean it's an
[02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:23.800]  epidemic in Austin yeah they say it's all happening on campuses when it
[02:56:23.800 --> 02:56:27.880]  really happens they cover it up I mean at knife point in parking lot yeah and
[02:56:27.880 --> 02:56:31.600]  it's just like what the hell and we're not saying the average Mexicans like this
[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:35.200]  but the criminals that get in trouble in Mexico run up here and then they like
[02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:39.200]  there was that railway serial killer killed like 30-something people yeah he
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:42.760]  been deported six or seven times they knew he was murdering people we're
[02:56:42.760 --> 02:56:46.480]  letting him go it's like Trump said I'll let it out two million people of 30
[02:56:46.480 --> 02:56:51.320]  million illegals are felons and they go he didn't know that number and actually
[02:56:51.320 --> 02:56:53.960]  I went look up this morning no he does that's what they admit the last three
[02:56:53.960 --> 02:56:58.000]  years alone they've released that are felons and it's two million he's a
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:03.400]  conservative number two million people why the hell if you are from Latin
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:10.040]  America and you're a rapist or an armed robber do you get let go what planet are
[02:57:10.040 --> 02:57:14.760]  we on here it's a it's a free pass and Obama let out a bunch at least a hundred
[02:57:14.760 --> 02:57:18.440]  that was over a hundred thousand prisoners out of jail they just said oh
[02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:21.360]  and they're they were all illegals and it was every three months they just well
[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:24.520]  we're just gonna let them go but Rachel Maddow thinks it's all funny and then she
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:27.840]  went on and told for the rest of the show attack
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:34.080]  promoting us but the problem is do it listen we noticed there was no extra
[02:57:34.080 --> 02:57:37.720]  cells this morning off this they did that there's no viewers bro yeah I've been
[02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:41.680]  on CNN Fox MSNBC over and over again to the point of when they call me now I
[02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:44.280]  don't even go on it right because they just added it they always would take to
[02:57:44.280 --> 02:57:49.720]  the it's no effect I go in some little Christian radio station as a guest and I
[02:57:49.720 --> 02:57:54.080]  say I plug a film I sell 200 copies right and the point is isn't as a measure
[02:57:54.080 --> 02:58:00.200]  of the people out there that's who cares a while yeah it's like talking to dead
[02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:04.240]  people I don't go to the cemetery and give speeches right and let me tell you
[02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:08.280]  cemetery it's time to rise up and fight the new order no they're dead Christ said

[03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:08.640]  our great auxiliary reporters there in Ohio Billy Weaver and her great husband

[03:01:11.880 --> 03:01:15.680]  funding to actually hire them full-time soon but this is huge this isn't just
[03:01:15.680 --> 03:01:20.760]  ambulances buried in the report is like 45 minutes in a tent and everything else
[03:01:20.760 --> 03:01:24.640]  happening and then and then stretchers being run around this is big I wish this
[03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:28.440]  would go viral yeah we put out a report or Millie did on Friday which we put out
[03:01:28.440 --> 03:01:32.040]  we put it out and you got a lot it got over 200,000 views about you know the
[03:01:32.040 --> 03:01:35.640]  ambulance coming in and and people attacked her and said those there's
[03:01:35.640 --> 03:01:39.320]  ambulances with every presidential motorcade which there is and a
[03:01:39.320 --> 03:01:42.760]  presidential motorcade she ain't president yet it's not normal and Trump
[03:01:42.760 --> 03:01:47.360]  at the same location in Cleveland didn't have an ambulance but normally well
[03:01:47.360 --> 03:01:49.440]  of course we missed the farce of the trees and this matter she's in this
[03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:52.600]  medical tent and running around like someone's dying she's got a periscope
[03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:56.000]  that's in in that report there's a link to her long periscope which is live
[03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:59.640]  video and she's shooting live video she gets the gurney coming in she's talking
[03:01:59.640 --> 03:02:02.120]  about oh what's that why is there a gurney here is there something going on
[03:02:02.120 --> 03:02:06.520]  and it sits over here by this backstage area where she had just got done
[03:02:06.520 --> 03:02:11.320]  coughing I guess that her hacking attack and so she's sitting there forever and
[03:02:11.320 --> 03:02:14.600]  never comes out and they're waiting for and waiting for and waiting for and
[03:02:14.600 --> 03:02:18.480]  finally they they they scoot her out I guess I don't know Millie got that on
[03:02:18.480 --> 03:02:22.040]  tape I don't think she has that on tape we're scurrying away but then the whole
[03:02:22.040 --> 03:02:25.920]  entourage leaves you know with the gurney the gurney gets packed up it was
[03:02:25.920 --> 03:02:28.800]  any independent media we'd have exactly what happened but there's just this
[03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:32.400]  blackout right there's I'm concerned about Hillary Dr. Drew fired right let's
[03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:35.520]  go to part of this clip the full interviews on info wars dot com here it
[03:02:35.520 --> 03:02:41.560]  is Hillary Clinton has a literal deathbed on wheels being rolled up to her
[03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:46.520]  tent to just catch her in case she drops dead at any minute yeah that's
[03:02:46.520 --> 03:02:53.600]  exactly what it was it was pretty crazy because I'm standing there waiting for
[03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:58.440]  Hillary to you know come out of her tent and the event was already running
[03:02:58.440 --> 03:03:04.040]  over an hour behind so I had a feeling that something was wrong that maybe she
[03:03:04.040 --> 03:03:09.120]  was sick or having some kind of type of an episode or something and sure enough I
[03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:15.360]  turn right around and and there is a gurney and there's you know these EMS
[03:03:15.360 --> 03:03:21.360]  workers but they are wearing what looks like bulletproof vests and you know I
[03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:27.600]  was like is this for Hillary Clinton and sure enough it was the same EMS workers
[03:03:27.600 --> 03:03:33.440]  that my video camera guy actually caught you know those people you know the
[03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:38.040]  ambulance it was part of her motorcade you know those guys came out of there and
[03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:42.840]  it seemed like they tried to wheel around as to you know not look too obvious
[03:03:42.840 --> 03:03:48.560]  going directly out of her tent or into her tent but they were staged right
[03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:53.960]  behind stage right waiting in the event that maybe you know she might have had
[03:03:53.960 --> 03:03:58.160]  something happen or maybe she fainted or fell or you know we don't know what
[03:03:58.160 --> 03:04:05.320]  could have happened or a change of diapers or she had more I said post
[03:04:05.320 --> 03:04:08.800]  partner pressure she was giving birth to more little alien life well bottom line
[03:04:08.800 --> 03:04:11.720]  is the globalist are attacking us at point blank range because they know we've
[03:04:11.720 --> 03:04:14.600]  broken through we're exposing what they're really doing we're asking real
[03:04:14.600 --> 03:04:17.360]  questions they can't stand it Robert gonna come back and get this big flu
[03:04:17.360 --> 03:04:20.240]  news David Knight we're going to break in 30 seconds but tell us what else is
[03:04:20.240 --> 03:04:23.840]  coming up in the next hours you host my friend Alex we're gonna be taking a
[03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:27.800]  look at what Donald Trump did today he was talking to the Family Research
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:32.440]  Council and he called for getting rid of the Johnson Amendment as you remember
[03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:36.120]  we have talked to the public freedom Sunday people before that's the gag
[03:04:36.120 --> 03:04:40.160]  amendment on churches and violation of the First Amendment important statement
[03:04:40.160 --> 03:04:43.040]  he made today Trump is very excited about that when I've talked to him on the
[03:04:43.040 --> 03:04:46.280]  phone he always brings that up he said you know I'm gonna free the churches
[03:04:46.280 --> 03:04:48.720]  churches that have free spirit like okay yeah I know you're doing that he just
[03:04:48.720 --> 03:04:52.200]  keeps that Trump's really into that really into religious freedom so we're
[03:04:52.200 --> 03:04:55.240]  gonna be talking about that straight ahead I'm gonna punch you out till this
[03:04:55.240 --> 03:04:59.480]  Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. I'll be co-hosting with Paul Watson but we'll come right
[03:04:59.480 --> 03:05:03.760]  back on the side of Rob do it every night Joe Bakes here with info wars.com PR
[03:05:03.760 --> 03:05:08.280]  Newswire Hillary's health concerns serious say most doctors pulled by the
[03:05:08.280 --> 03:05:13.000]  Association of American Physicians and Surgeons concerns about Hillary Clinton's
[03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:16.320]  health are serious could be disqualifying for the position of
[03:05:16.320 --> 03:05:22.360]  president of the US says nearly 71% of 250 physicians responding to an informal
[03:05:22.360 --> 03:05:26.560]  internet survey by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons about
[03:05:26.560 --> 03:05:31.680]  20% said concerns were likely overblown but should be addressed as by full
[03:05:31.680 --> 03:05:36.760]  release of medical records only 2.7% responded that they were just a
[03:05:36.760 --> 03:05:40.720]  political attack while more than 81% were aware of her history of a
[03:05:40.720 --> 03:05:46.720]  concussion only 59% were aware of the cerebral sinus thrombosis and 52% of
[03:05:46.720 --> 03:05:51.520]  the history of deep venous thrombosis obviously there's something going on
[03:05:51.520 --> 03:05:54.880]  with Hillary's health and it's not sexist to question it you can find more

[03:07:51.240 --> 03:07:55.880]  quality lab standard that means it's clean that means it's pure that's info
[03:07:55.880 --> 03:08:01.720]  wars life.com and vitamin mineral fusion take action now before we sell out
[03:08:06.040 --> 03:08:11.760]  we now take you live to the central Texas Command Center in the heart of the
[03:08:11.760 --> 03:08:28.360]  resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show. All right we are back in the
[03:08:28.360 --> 03:08:31.880]  fourth hour overdrive this is Rob Dew hosting got David Knight standing by to
[03:08:31.880 --> 03:08:36.800]  take over we're gonna just put bookends on a couple things Rachel Maddow was
[03:08:36.800 --> 03:08:42.520]  talking about how esteemed her group is on the left and with lies and stuff and
[03:08:42.520 --> 03:08:47.960]  then over here in the fringe right where nobody goes they're listening to Alex
[03:08:47.960 --> 03:08:51.240]  Jones and then they take a bunch of stuff out of context but here here's an
[03:08:51.240 --> 03:08:55.920]  article out of the American Mirror only 20% of expected turnout for Hillary's
[03:08:55.920 --> 03:09:00.800]  speech to Baptist convention guys get the shot of this this is amazing they
[03:09:00.800 --> 03:09:04.200]  actually close in you could see him a bunch of seats behind this area that
[03:09:04.200 --> 03:09:09.360]  they're closing off with walls can y'all get that on document cam I mean it is
[03:09:09.360 --> 03:09:14.280]  truly amazing right there you can see sparsely populated all around here back
[03:09:14.280 --> 03:09:19.440]  here that's nobody and they're closing it in to make it look like it's bigger so
[03:09:19.440 --> 03:09:23.040]  it's all about illusion that Hillary is the even the incredible candidate at
[03:09:23.040 --> 03:09:27.920]  this point Bernie Sanders could get more people out to a Baptist convention and
[03:09:27.920 --> 03:09:32.000]  he's the Jewish guy he could get more people to show up for him than Hillary
[03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:36.760]  Clinton could and you could see I actually went to a Bernie rally in
[03:09:36.760 --> 03:09:41.120]  Green Bay, Wisconsin and I went to a Clinton rally it was Bill Clinton even
[03:09:41.120 --> 03:09:45.440]  the day before maybe about 400 people at the most at this Bill Clinton thing and
[03:09:45.440 --> 03:09:50.080]  that's given him a lot of credit very small room very small room and then you
[03:09:50.080 --> 03:09:57.320]  go to a stadium an indoor arena about 1200 people for Bernie Sanders yet he
[03:09:57.320 --> 03:10:01.040]  magically you know gets beat in all these places and then when they look they
[03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:05.480]  did the analysis and when the the places with paper ballots he actually would
[03:10:05.480 --> 03:10:08.000]  win and then the place that had electronic voting he would be losing by
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:13.520]  20% so it's just it's just funny the way they do this and you know of course
[03:10:13.520 --> 03:10:16.800]  Hillary health concerns serious most doctors pulled by the American
[03:10:16.800 --> 03:10:22.560]  Association of Physicians and Surgeons 71% say her concerns are serious and she
[03:10:22.560 --> 03:10:26.560]  should be disqualified but that's okay we're kooks because we asked that type
[03:10:26.560 --> 03:10:29.520]  of information now I want to finish up with this other health news this is why
[03:10:29.520 --> 03:10:32.760]  I came into Alex this morning got this form right here well I've actually
[03:10:32.760 --> 03:10:37.800]  threw away the first form that came with my second son goes to an elementary
[03:10:37.800 --> 03:10:46.040]  school and it's a 2016-17 seasonal flu vaccine consent form please complete the
[03:10:46.040 --> 03:10:49.600]  entire form and sign incomplete forms will not be accepted they want all this
[03:10:49.600 --> 03:10:54.200]  information they want your insurance information and then here this is the
[03:10:54.200 --> 03:10:59.840]  juicy right here guys look at that yes I want to help protect my family and
[03:10:59.840 --> 03:11:04.800]  community from flu by allowing my child to receive a flu vaccine that's the
[03:11:04.800 --> 03:11:09.400]  checkbox yes now no David Knight listen to this no I do not wish to help protect
[03:11:09.400 --> 03:11:13.520]  my family and community by allowing my child to participate and then they want
[03:11:13.520 --> 03:11:18.320]  a reason they want a reason why you don't want to participate and then you
[03:11:18.320 --> 03:11:22.360]  got to sign it and they put a little bit of information here on the back which
[03:11:22.360 --> 03:11:25.480]  doesn't show that much it this is the insert you get from the doctor when
[03:11:25.480 --> 03:11:30.840]  they say oh here's the insert when it's not this is an actual flu vaccine insert
[03:11:30.840 --> 03:11:36.480]  that's what it is okay it's many pages long and I've only got a few things
[03:11:36.480 --> 03:11:39.520]  highlighted in here you should go through and read this here's another flu
[03:11:39.520 --> 03:11:43.840]  vaccine insert here's another one okay this is what they look like they're not
[03:11:43.840 --> 03:11:50.520]  a page okay and if you care about your child you should read an insert and see
[03:11:50.520 --> 03:11:55.440]  what's in it because it has things like this and I'll get your comment on this
[03:11:55.440 --> 03:12:00.040]  David as we go along oh well first talks about how you know they say a
[03:12:00.040 --> 03:12:02.920]  pregnant woman should get her flu shot here it says it's never been tested on
[03:12:02.920 --> 03:12:07.080]  reproductive systems on reproductive health or damaging a fetus yet they tell
[03:12:07.080 --> 03:12:12.680]  pregnant women to get them but they've never tested it on them oh here's the
[03:12:12.680 --> 03:12:17.600]  multi-dose vaccine contains 12 micrograms of mercury that's the point
[03:12:17.600 --> 03:12:23.200]  to five milliliter dose the half milliliter multi-dose from a multi-dose
[03:12:23.200 --> 03:12:30.840]  vaccine contains 25 micrograms of mercury oh oh we don't tell you that here's my
[03:12:30.840 --> 03:12:35.520]  favorite right here carcinogenesis mutinogenesis and impairment of
[03:12:35.520 --> 03:12:40.320]  fertility it's never been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutinogenic potential
[03:12:40.320 --> 03:12:44.760]  a reproductive study of female rabbits vaccine will flu zone is performed and
[03:12:44.760 --> 03:12:48.520]  they have they have no evidence of impairment of fertility but they've
[03:12:48.520 --> 03:12:53.560]  never tested to see if it causes cancer and we know the polio vaccine had the
[03:12:53.560 --> 03:12:58.680]  sv-40 virus in it caused cancer and lots of people and cancer rates are
[03:12:58.680 --> 03:13:02.400]  exploding and yet they want your young child to get vaccinated with the flu
[03:13:02.400 --> 03:13:05.880]  shot and if you don't they want to know a reason why so my wife threw away the
[03:13:05.880 --> 03:13:08.000]  first one didn't tell me about it because she goes you're gonna make a new
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:11.880]  story about it and what you told me about this one this morning I said give
[03:13:11.880 --> 03:13:16.120]  me that damn paper I'm doing a story on it today because this kind of stuff
[03:13:16.120 --> 03:13:19.640]  really pisses me off the school should not be involved even though we've
[03:13:19.640 --> 03:13:22.640]  already signed the the forms that they tell you to sign to get your kid into
[03:13:22.640 --> 03:13:28.080]  school that says we're opting out bro we don't want to be part of your medical
[03:13:28.080 --> 03:13:32.000]  paradigm which is keeping kids sick they've a night your comments on that
[03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:38.840]  well you know Alex Rob even the people who are vaccine advocates admit that the
[03:13:38.840 --> 03:13:43.040]  flu vaccine is not effective okay and what we're gonna see is the way that
[03:13:43.040 --> 03:13:45.800]  they're applying this pressure point through school we see this happening in
[03:13:45.800 --> 03:13:49.280]  California this year remember it was this year the school year where people
[03:13:49.280 --> 03:13:52.800]  in California is like you're not gonna put a new kid in the California system
[03:13:52.800 --> 03:13:58.840]  even private schools okay they ban it you can't get your kids educated sign
[03:13:58.840 --> 03:14:02.920]  them up for school or go past the the what was it the second grade or the
[03:14:02.920 --> 03:14:06.360]  seventh grade I can't remember if it's seven years old or the seventh grade
[03:14:06.360 --> 03:14:10.440]  anyway they're putting this block in there unless you get vaccines right and
[03:14:10.440 --> 03:14:13.800]  I put some stuff out on Twitter I you know when Gary Johnson was out there
[03:14:13.800 --> 03:14:17.520]  talking about well you know I think that this is really something ought to be
[03:14:17.520 --> 03:14:21.600]  decided locally but you know maybe if it becomes a federal issue I'd have to
[03:14:21.600 --> 03:14:25.520]  take a look at the science and I said you know what get your laws off my body
[03:14:25.520 --> 03:14:29.840]  Gary he loves to say that when it comes to abortion but he won't say that when
[03:14:29.840 --> 03:14:33.000]  it comes to your kids with you making those decisions about that so I got I
[03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:37.400]  got trolled predictably by some vaccine supporter that's out there says you're
[03:14:37.400 --> 03:14:40.640]  dangerous I said yeah you know freedom is dangerous but the slavery that you
[03:14:40.640 --> 03:14:45.000]  propose is far more dangerous exactly and you mentioned the effectiveness yeah
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:49.720]  let's go to this this is from USA Today flu shot only 19% percent effective this
[03:14:49.720 --> 03:14:53.960]  winter that was in 2015 well they've gotten a little better I will give them
[03:14:53.960 --> 03:14:57.760]  that now they're saying it that only fails half the time and that's it that
[03:14:57.760 --> 03:15:02.680]  came on April there's a it's only gonna fail half the time so give your kid a
[03:15:02.680 --> 03:15:06.200]  shot that even even on the little insert it says it could give you yon beret but
[03:15:06.200 --> 03:15:09.680]  most people won't even look that up okay most people's parents are like yeah
[03:15:09.680 --> 03:15:13.240]  whatever we'll sign to get your flu shot and it still charges you for it this is
[03:15:13.240 --> 03:15:18.160]  all run by a a nonprofit which is basically financed by these for-profit
[03:15:18.160 --> 03:15:21.360]  corporations that provide medical services to schools you know hearing
[03:15:21.360 --> 03:15:24.360]  tests and vision tests and stuff like that but now they want to start providing
[03:15:24.360 --> 03:15:29.440]  vaccines and now they say the flu miss doesn't even work that came out they're
[03:15:29.440 --> 03:15:32.600]  saying flu miss doesn't work we're not even recommending it for kids you got to
[03:15:32.600 --> 03:15:35.760]  get the shot because we got to get the aluminum and the mercury inside of you
[03:15:35.760 --> 03:15:38.760]  and all the other ingredients that when you start reading about you're like what
[03:15:38.760 --> 03:15:41.840]  the hell I'm not gonna put this in my kid yeah you know Rob you mentioned the
[03:15:41.840 --> 03:15:46.760]  mercury and of course thymerosol I'll give you a personal example decades ago
[03:15:46.760 --> 03:15:52.120]  when I started to get contact lenses I would put the solution in my eyes and
[03:15:52.120 --> 03:15:56.720]  they would immediately turn blood red and start burning okay so I stopped using
[03:15:56.720 --> 03:16:00.960]  contacts all together and then I guess it's about 10 years ago I had a doctor
[03:16:00.960 --> 03:16:05.040]  say you know once you try contacts and I said well again but I'm allergic to the
[03:16:05.040 --> 03:16:08.760]  thymyrosol that's why we worked out and and he goes oh they don't even allow that
[03:16:08.760 --> 03:16:13.000]  anymore you know that's mercury it's like oh okay so they were selling I
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:17.680]  dropped mercury in your arms but they put the thymyrosol and the vaccines now
[03:16:17.680 --> 03:16:21.640]  because you can't see what it's doing to your body like you can when you drop it
[03:16:21.640 --> 03:16:26.200]  in your eyes yeah yeah exactly exact and and that's how they hide it and it's
[03:16:26.200 --> 03:16:29.840]  amazing that people are gonna sign their kids up for this and there's probably
[03:16:29.840 --> 03:16:33.800]  gonna be an outbreak of flu at the school I'll be watching Sunset Valley
[03:16:33.800 --> 03:16:38.600]  Elementary by the way I'll just let you guys know where it is but that it's
[03:16:38.600 --> 03:16:42.040]  crazy that they're sending this home and then we didn't even fill it out and
[03:16:42.040 --> 03:16:46.520]  send it back because I don't want to be a part of their you know little there who
[03:16:46.520 --> 03:16:49.400]  knows what they're doing with all this data too who your insurance company is
[03:16:49.400 --> 03:16:53.360]  your policyholders name the member ID ID you know who knows what they could do
[03:16:53.360 --> 03:16:56.160]  with all this information but they want that so they can go and charge your
[03:16:56.160 --> 03:17:00.680]  insurance company but are they gonna imply that that is your consent if you
[03:17:00.680 --> 03:17:04.000]  don't give them that form I mean is that the fault position you know because
[03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:07.160]  this is they won't do anything unless it's a incomplete form well they say
[03:17:07.160 --> 03:17:10.920]  incomplete forms will not be accepted okay but I've told my kid under no
[03:17:10.920 --> 03:17:13.800]  circumstances are you to go anywhere where they're jabbing anything into
[03:17:13.800 --> 03:17:20.080]  anybody run for your life exactly and I say I will give you lots of cookies if
[03:17:20.080 --> 03:17:24.640]  you do that you know Rob last night we went to see a movie of Florence say
[03:17:24.640 --> 03:17:28.400]  Florence Foster Jenkins okay it's really funny it's a Meryl Streep thing about
[03:17:28.400 --> 03:17:32.440]  true life story anyway this this woman who was perhaps one of the funniest
[03:17:32.440 --> 03:17:37.400]  worst singers ever there's been a lot of movies about her died in 1944 she was
[03:17:37.400 --> 03:17:40.920]  suffering from syphilis the way they treated it was with arsenic and mercury
[03:17:40.920 --> 03:17:44.440]  and when they mentioned that it's like people in the audience are like oh my
[03:17:44.440 --> 03:17:49.480]  you know but that's what we have that was 1944 and we're gonna look back in
[03:17:49.480 --> 03:17:52.080]  future years at the pharmaceuticals that people are giving us and we're gonna
[03:17:52.080 --> 03:17:55.000]  say the same thing about that oh yeah I've got an article I'm gonna cover up
[03:17:55.000 --> 03:18:01.320]  cover later in the cover up I might expose it later in the hour addictive
[03:18:01.320 --> 03:18:05.360]  painkiller profiteers donating half a million dollars to fight cannabis
[03:18:05.360 --> 03:18:09.120]  legalization in Arizona so you've got a big pharmaceutical company that has a
[03:18:09.120 --> 03:18:14.240]  very dangerous drug they've been sued by the Attorney General in Illinois and
[03:18:14.240 --> 03:18:19.120]  yet they're spending a half million dollars to try to fight medical marijuana
[03:18:19.120 --> 03:18:22.720]  in Arizona that's the true story that we see being repeated over and over
[03:18:22.720 --> 03:18:26.360]  across this country and David you're talking about 1940s technology what
[03:18:26.360 --> 03:18:29.840]  they were using for medical care back then Dr. Drew was saying the same thing
[03:18:29.840 --> 03:18:34.240]  about Hillary he said I'm looking at these medications from the 1940s they
[03:18:34.240 --> 03:18:37.560]  don't even use this anymore because it could cause all these other side effects
[03:18:37.560 --> 03:18:41.560]  yeah he was who you know it's like her family doctor that she met when she was
[03:18:41.560 --> 03:18:46.080]  a child is still giving her health advice I mean you would think you know
[03:18:46.080 --> 03:18:48.520]  somebody running for president will be getting better health advice and that's
[03:18:48.520 --> 03:18:52.480]  what he was concerned about and he's a mainstream guy he's not you know he
[03:18:52.480 --> 03:18:56.520]  toes the line when it comes to this stuff but obviously he didn't toe the
[03:18:56.520 --> 03:19:00.160]  line this time so now his shows being canceled but it has nothing to do with
[03:19:00.160 --> 03:19:02.800]  what he said about Hillary that's what that's what they want you to believe
[03:19:02.800 --> 03:19:07.240]  well maybe she's been on it for a very long time Rob I'm sure she has I mean
[03:19:07.240 --> 03:19:11.200]  you know you can't make those goofy faces or I don't see how she could even
[03:19:11.200 --> 03:19:15.760]  talk with two giant vessels whatever that whatever she had in her mouth oh
[03:19:15.760 --> 03:19:20.360]  that was a lot of speculation there but how she has a way she quickly ejects
[03:19:20.360 --> 03:19:23.360]  them out and then takes a drink lots of
[03:19:23.360 --> 03:19:27.400]  expectation there yeah you got to love the people who are examining this
[03:19:27.400 --> 03:19:30.600]  footage and looking at it going what the hell I've got to put this out to
[03:19:30.600 --> 03:19:33.880]  people you know the guy who saw the reflection in her ear that looks like
[03:19:33.880 --> 03:19:37.240]  it could be an earpiece and then we're showing the photos that they're showing
[03:19:37.240 --> 03:19:41.920]  on MSNBC and one of them looks completely doctored completely you can see
[03:19:41.920 --> 03:19:46.240]  the jagged edges around the ear like on the inside not you know on the outside
[03:19:46.240 --> 03:19:49.600]  of a person you could see some a little bit but they're in the inside of the
[03:19:49.600 --> 03:19:54.000]  ear it's everywhere it's like whoa obviously obviously Photoshop I'm sure

[03:24:14.240 --> 03:24:17.440]  we've got a lot of news we're gonna talk about we're gonna continue with the
[03:24:17.440 --> 03:24:20.960]  medical news that I was just just mentioned to Rob do we're also going to
[03:24:20.960 --> 03:24:25.840]  talk about Trump's repeal of the Johnson amendment if you don't know what that is
[03:24:25.840 --> 03:24:29.560]  we're gonna tell you briefly what the history of that is what Donald Trump said
[03:24:29.560 --> 03:24:33.600]  today to the Family Research Council is interesting you know because we had Rob
[03:24:33.600 --> 03:24:38.320]  do showing the pictures of the meeting where Hillary is talking to Baptist they
[03:24:38.320 --> 03:24:42.960]  couldn't even fill one-fifth of the place even after they brought the walls
[03:24:42.960 --> 03:24:47.240]  forward and if you look at that picture it's even worse than that it's mostly
[03:24:47.240 --> 03:24:50.200]  empty there's only about a fifth of the seats filled and if you look at the seats
[03:24:50.200 --> 03:24:54.960]  that are filled there's a lot of people sitting there in white robes I mean she
[03:24:54.960 --> 03:24:59.520]  is literally preaching to the choir folks that's how bad it is and nobody else
[03:24:59.520 --> 03:25:03.800]  is showing up at these events but it is an important free speech First Amendment
[03:25:03.800 --> 03:25:08.680]  issue we're also going to talk about how Obama now has a Saudi dilemma thanks to
[03:25:08.680 --> 03:25:13.440]  Donald Trump the House has unanimously passed a bill to allow 9-11 lawsuits I'm
[03:25:13.440 --> 03:25:16.920]  gonna break that down as to why I think Trump had a lot to do with it we'll take
[03:25:16.920 --> 03:25:20.200]  a little bit of credit for that here at Info Wars as well we're talking about
[03:25:20.200 --> 03:25:26.200]  what's going on the pipeline out west in Dakota and we've got a lot of news
[03:25:26.200 --> 03:25:30.320]  that we want to talk about but first you know when Alex is playing Rachel Maddow
[03:25:30.320 --> 03:25:36.000]  making fun of our products and saying you know don't swallow that toothpaste
[03:25:36.000 --> 03:25:40.080]  that fluoride in that toothpaste that's really bad stuff you know John Bown
[03:25:40.080 --> 03:25:45.560]  actually did a report on that reading the the warning label that's on the bag
[03:25:45.560 --> 03:25:49.320]  you know Rob was just talking about the inserts and your vaccines read what is
[03:25:49.320 --> 03:25:55.120]  on the back of the the toothpaste says hey if your kids swallow this call the
[03:25:55.120 --> 03:25:59.960]  emergency services and get something done about this now why is it that they
[03:25:59.960 --> 03:26:02.480]  have to warn you about the fluoride in the toothpaste but they put it in our
[03:26:02.480 --> 03:26:06.840]  water and look at the Harvard studies has she ever heard of Harvard you know
[03:26:06.840 --> 03:26:10.840]  that it's a venerated liberal northeastern establishment maybe
[03:26:10.840 --> 03:26:15.120]  shut a see what they have to say about excessive fluoride and the effects that
[03:26:15.120 --> 03:26:19.640]  it has on your IQ especially children's IQ so we have a lot of specials up we
[03:26:19.640 --> 03:26:24.000]  have a 30 to 40 percent off Info Wars select storeable food far be it from us
[03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:28.080]  to tell you that you need food to survive and a way that you can get a good
[03:26:28.080 --> 03:26:32.560]  clean source of it at a discount 30 to 40 percent off that you can store for
[03:26:32.560 --> 03:26:36.320]  emergencies I mean yeah how paranoid is that thing that you can have a flood or
[03:26:36.320 --> 03:26:40.680]  a hurricane or tornado or something even larger that could take down the grid for
[03:26:40.680 --> 03:26:44.320]  a while but you know you don't need to have any food even even for a week you
[03:26:44.320 --> 03:26:48.400]  know just just rely on the just-in-time delivery of Walmart that's what you
[03:26:48.400 --> 03:26:53.800]  should do you know don't buy our our clean select storeable foods okay just
[03:26:53.800 --> 03:26:57.840]  depend on Walmart they'll be there for you Rachel Maddow promises that so we

[03:27:01.480 --> 03:27:05.880]  also got 20% off survival shield x2 nascent iodine want to make sure that
[03:27:05.880 --> 03:27:09.840]  you got some iodine now that's that's paranoid but you might want to look into
[03:27:09.840 --> 03:27:12.840]  that why you might want to have that air filter you wouldn't want to have clean
[03:27:12.840 --> 03:27:18.000]  air would you that's paranoid 20% off the Alexa pure air filters and we've got
[03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:22.440]  another conspiracy theory for you you should think about making sure your
[03:27:22.440 --> 03:27:26.320]  water is clean and pure you know for health reasons that's that's just a
[03:27:26.320 --> 03:27:29.920]  conspiracy theory we're putting forward here but if you buy into that
[03:27:29.920 --> 03:27:34.320]  conspiracy theory about clean water we got 20% off Alexa pure water filters
[03:27:34.320 --> 03:27:39.680]  again infowarstore.com we have a massive sales up to 40% off our preparedness

[03:27:52.920 --> 03:27:59.280]  15% off supermail vitality 15% off deep cleanse just in honor of mr. Maddow
[03:27:59.280 --> 03:28:04.160]  all right let's talk about what's happening out in Arizona headline from
[03:28:04.160 --> 03:28:09.480]  RT addictive painkiller profiteer donates a half a million dollars to fight
[03:28:09.480 --> 03:28:14.920]  cannabis legalization in Arizona this is incis therapeutics their product is the
[03:28:14.920 --> 03:28:21.040]  drug name subsist it is a sublingual fentanyl spray okay and if you don't
[03:28:21.040 --> 03:28:25.520]  know why that is that is what Prince died of an overdose of is what one third
[03:28:25.520 --> 03:28:30.000]  of Ohio's three thousand deaths caused by lethal drug consumption last year
[03:28:30.000 --> 03:28:35.480]  were linked to that drug it is the only product the only product that that
[03:28:35.480 --> 03:28:40.680]  corporation that is fighting medical marijuana produces wouldn't be because
[03:28:40.680 --> 03:28:45.040]  it is a competitor to them would it a John Hopkins University you know those
[03:28:45.040 --> 03:28:50.080]  conspiracy theorists at John Hopkins they did a study back in 2014 they found
[03:28:50.080 --> 03:28:55.520]  that legalized marijuana had states that had it had 25% less overdose deaths
[03:28:55.520 --> 03:29:01.120]  from prescription drugs than in states where it remained legal okay and as I
[03:29:01.120 --> 03:29:05.160]  pointed out this is the only product this company sells last month Illinois
[03:29:05.160 --> 03:29:09.640]  Attorney General brought a lawsuit against this company claiming that they
[03:29:09.640 --> 03:29:14.000]  had deceptively marketed and sold their medication to doctors for uses other
[03:29:14.000 --> 03:29:18.160]  than cancer treatment which is the only thing the FDA has approved as sole use
[03:29:18.160 --> 03:29:23.040]  for she also said the company has a desire for increased profits that has
[03:29:23.040 --> 03:29:28.480]  led it to disregard patients health and to push addicted opioids for non FDA
[03:29:28.480 --> 03:29:33.400]  approved purposes but don't take medical marijuana because that's for more
[03:29:33.400 --> 03:29:38.680]  dangerous they tell you that is the naked self-interest that is how the FDA and
[03:29:38.680 --> 03:29:44.520]  the DEA have had regulatory capture by these pharmaceutical companies that's
[03:29:44.520 --> 03:29:47.520]  why they're keeping the stuff off the market stay with us we got more news

[03:31:22.360 --> 03:31:26.640]  telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes but when it runs out
[03:31:26.640 --> 03:31:31.160]  you start dying we chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical

[03:33:08.080 --> 03:33:20.600]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show welcome
[03:33:20.600 --> 03:33:23.400]  back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight this segment I want to talk a
[03:33:23.400 --> 03:33:27.760]  little bit about money and politics and the political horrors that are seeking
[03:33:27.760 --> 03:33:33.360]  it and I'm looking at you Gary Johnson let's talk about it first of all RT and
[03:33:33.360 --> 03:33:36.960]  drudge point of this move over Koch brothers Facebook co-founder pledges
[03:33:36.960 --> 03:33:40.760]  $20 million to the Democrats and of course Koch brothers are the famous
[03:33:40.760 --> 03:33:45.720]  favorite whipping boy of the left although they have contributed to the
[03:33:45.720 --> 03:33:50.040]  Clintons in the past and they absolutely hate Donald Trump but now we've
[03:33:50.040 --> 03:33:54.960]  got $20 million from a Facebook co-founder going to Hillary Clinton
[03:33:54.960 --> 03:33:58.360]  and remember back when they had the nominating convention for the LP I
[03:33:58.360 --> 03:34:03.240]  remember them literally prostituting themselves on C-span we've got the guy
[03:34:03.240 --> 03:34:07.440]  the fat man who was stripping down to the G-string which was unbelievable I
[03:34:07.440 --> 03:34:12.600]  guess that's the first for a C-span but at the same time perhaps even worse I
[03:34:12.600 --> 03:34:17.520]  would say definitely worse we had the libertarian party itself talking about
[03:34:17.520 --> 03:34:20.640]  how they were going to get all of this money from the Koch brothers and the
[03:34:20.640 --> 03:34:23.120]  Koch brothers said no you're not no you're not pull it back I don't know if
[03:34:23.120 --> 03:34:25.440]  they're giving them money or not somebody's giving them a lot of money
[03:34:25.440 --> 03:34:29.160]  they're running a lot of ads a lot of very effective ads which don't really
[03:34:29.160 --> 03:34:32.760]  talk about their positions don't really talk about the things that are unique
[03:34:32.760 --> 03:34:37.040]  about Gary Johnson as a libertarian candidate opposing things like the
[03:34:37.040 --> 03:34:43.600]  Second Amendment talking about how he is obliquely for mandatory vaccines if he
[03:34:43.600 --> 03:34:47.560]  doesn't if he pushes back on that somewhat heat the man said if it becomes a
[03:34:47.560 --> 03:34:52.120]  federal issue I'll have to defer to the scientists it's like you have absolutely
[03:34:52.120 --> 03:34:56.240]  no concept of individual liberty if you say that even if he says I think it's a
[03:34:56.240 --> 03:35:01.240]  local issue it's not a local issue Gary stop being a collectivist status it's
[03:35:01.240 --> 03:35:04.960]  not a local issue it's an individual rights issue you should stand up for
[03:35:04.960 --> 03:35:09.760]  that you should be as indignant four years ago when the TSA was demanding
[03:35:09.760 --> 03:35:14.720]  papers from Americans at the airport as you are about people demanding papers
[03:35:14.720 --> 03:35:19.600]  from people here illegally okay but let's look at what just recently happened
[03:35:19.600 --> 03:35:24.920]  there was a great parody video that went up on the Daily Beast about Gary
[03:35:24.920 --> 03:35:28.320]  Johnson the Aleppo incident I want to play a little bit of this because it's
[03:35:28.320 --> 03:35:33.120]  very funny and then I'm gonna go over the fact that you know he said that he
[03:35:33.120 --> 03:35:37.280]  thought initially as an excuse he said I thought that Aleppo was an acronym so I
[03:35:37.280 --> 03:35:40.760]  actually put it out on my Twitter account I said okay an acronym maybe you
[03:35:40.760 --> 03:35:44.360]  guys can come up with some funny and accurate acronyms and they did so I'm
[03:35:44.360 --> 03:35:48.800]  gonna read you some of the acronyms for Aleppo that came up with some of the
[03:35:48.800 --> 03:35:53.040]  people on my Twitter account but let's play this video this is Gary Johnson
[03:35:53.040 --> 03:35:56.360]  playing Jeopardy
[03:35:56.360 --> 03:36:04.040]  its biggest university is Boise State what is Aleppo no cue the deer and
[03:36:04.040 --> 03:36:12.440]  antelope this is Kansas' state song what is Aleppo no a Liberian warlord
[03:36:12.440 --> 03:36:18.680]  known as General Butt naked inspired an antagonist in this recent musical about
[03:36:18.680 --> 03:36:22.640]  missionaries in Africa Aleppo you are wrong
[03:36:22.640 --> 03:36:27.640]  you get the idea it's a very funny video is done by the Daily Beast you can
[03:36:27.640 --> 03:36:32.900]  watch the the full thing at their site what is Aleppo okay he didn't know what
[03:36:32.900 --> 03:36:37.160]  that was and interestingly enough you know Aleppo the largest city in Syria the
[03:36:37.160 --> 03:36:42.600]  commercial center of Syria was also the site of the Battle of Aleppo which began
[03:36:42.600 --> 03:36:47.640]  I believe it was the summer I think was in July of 2012 when Gary Johnson was
[03:36:47.640 --> 03:36:52.120]  running for president four years ago he couldn't be bothered he didn't want to
[03:36:52.120 --> 03:36:56.400]  know what the sources of that war were and you know if you if you're gonna be
[03:36:56.400 --> 03:37:01.120]  completely ignorant about where things come from like 9-11 you're not going to
[03:37:01.120 --> 03:37:05.480]  have a very effective opposition to it if you don't really understand what
[03:37:05.480 --> 03:37:10.760]  happened in Benghazi in Libya and the prelude to Syria who was behind that the
[03:37:10.760 --> 03:37:16.800]  fact that we were starting that war that we were funding and training ISIS you're
[03:37:16.800 --> 03:37:19.720]  not going to have a very effective solution to it you're going to fall for
[03:37:19.720 --> 03:37:23.600]  all kinds of political right politically correct nonsense like saying we need to
[03:37:23.600 --> 03:37:29.360]  bring the refugees here no we need to bring peace to the area by stopping what
[03:37:29.360 --> 03:37:34.640]  we have done to start that that's that's the real issue and I understand that a
[03:37:34.640 --> 03:37:37.920]  lot of people would say well it's kind of a gotcha moment it actually was
[03:37:37.920 --> 03:37:40.960]  something that was talked about quite a bit I mean we just had a lot of people
[03:37:40.960 --> 03:37:46.120]  putting up that horrific poster that child of the Aleppo boy I mean it was in
[03:37:46.120 --> 03:37:51.680]  the news quite a bit and I understand from to some degree libertarians just
[03:37:51.680 --> 03:37:55.480]  don't want to get involved in the rest of the world okay but he's not
[03:37:55.480 --> 03:38:00.640]  articulating that clearly and he is selling a politically correct solution
[03:38:00.640 --> 03:38:03.960]  for the globalist and he doesn't understand the consequences of that
[03:38:03.960 --> 03:38:08.480]  either he doesn't understand where the open borders refugee movement comes
[03:38:08.480 --> 03:38:13.040]  from either he doesn't understand the origins of the Syrian conflict he
[03:38:13.040 --> 03:38:16.920]  doesn't understand how Hillary Clinton set the Middle East on fire he and
[03:38:16.920 --> 03:38:22.920]  William Weld have praised her as a statesperson okay they don't understand
[03:38:22.920 --> 03:38:27.720]  anything that is happening at absolutely totally clueless as to the origins of
[03:38:27.720 --> 03:38:31.560]  that but I want to talk in a moment before we I want to spend a little bit
[03:38:31.560 --> 03:38:36.080]  more time on this you know Clinton was pretty clueless about Iraq about Mosul
[03:38:36.080 --> 03:38:41.080]  as well but before we do you know Gary Johnson said hey as an excuse I really at
[03:38:41.080 --> 03:38:47.160]  first I thought Aleppo was a acronym so I asked people on Twitter I said give me
[03:38:47.160 --> 03:38:50.160]  some acronyms of what Aleppo might really stand for here's some of them
[03:38:50.160 --> 03:38:55.000]  awkward lunatic espouses piss poor opinions that's pretty good one
[03:38:55.000 --> 03:39:00.160]  astroturf libertarian exhibiting particularly painful obliviousness
[03:39:00.160 --> 03:39:07.800]  yep alleviating latent email problems post-op a loser envisioning pseudo
[03:39:07.800 --> 03:39:13.240]  presidential opportunities Aleppo the acronym a libertarian embarrassed
[03:39:13.240 --> 03:39:19.480]  political and a libertarian embarrassed political prospects over another one
[03:39:19.480 --> 03:39:25.080]  also low-energy please pull out and on and on and so we've got one person here
[03:39:25.080 --> 03:39:28.840]  says hey Gary Johnson thought Aleppo was a fifth member of the Marx Brothers you
[03:39:28.840 --> 03:39:33.800]  know the guy with the fuzzy hair I said they thought he the interviewer said
[03:39:33.800 --> 03:39:37.920]  guppetto which is why he snapped back so quickly because you know what he's just
[03:39:37.920 --> 03:39:43.280]  a puppet a puppet of the globalist but what about Hillary you know on the
[03:39:43.280 --> 03:39:50.000]  speech the forum that they were given the other night which really was a couple
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:54.520]  of speeches although Donald Trump took a lot of questions I thought he engaged
[03:39:54.520 --> 03:39:58.240]  very well but but Hillary came out and said you know we're not ever going to
[03:39:58.240 --> 03:40:04.560]  have any ground troops in Iraq ever and she's now being tagged on this by the
[03:40:04.560 --> 03:40:07.960]  Washington Post by ABC I mean the Washington Post I mean these people
[03:40:07.960 --> 03:40:12.640]  are basically paid campaign consultants for Hillary Clinton even they are having
[03:40:12.640 --> 03:40:17.480]  a problem with this here's what ABC said said Hillary Clinton on Wednesday said
[03:40:17.480 --> 03:40:21.960]  she wouldn't put ground troops in Iraq ever again and she would never use boots
[03:40:21.960 --> 03:40:28.040]  on the ground to defeat ISIS hmm and I want people to think about this as we're
[03:40:28.040 --> 03:40:31.200]  looking at this you know there are boots on the ground is what they pointed out
[03:40:31.200 --> 03:40:37.280]  okay we actually do have troops on the ground and we are putting more troops
[03:40:37.280 --> 03:40:40.800]  on the ground this headline from Wall Street Journal US gets ready to assist
[03:40:40.800 --> 03:40:46.360]  offensive to retake key Iraqi city from Islamic State now the Washington Post
[03:40:46.360 --> 03:40:50.520]  says they'd like to mince the words I like to play semantics I like to say
[03:40:50.520 --> 03:40:57.160]  well we don't have soldiers there we've got advisors and we've got air support
[03:40:57.160 --> 03:41:05.880]  yeah 4,000 plus advisors at some point you got to say that it's more than
[03:41:05.880 --> 03:41:10.880]  advisors and you also have to wonder as they build up in this offensive as
[03:41:10.880 --> 03:41:15.560]  American soldiers go into combat this Hillary Clinton gonna be so concerned
[03:41:15.560 --> 03:41:19.000]  about optics because that's what you're stressing the other night in the
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:22.400]  commander-in-chief forum Wednesday night she was saying we're not ever gonna put
[03:41:22.400 --> 03:41:26.000]  boots on the ground again we have to defeat ISIS we've got to do it with
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:31.000]  airpower and then she talks about they the Iraqis they've taken back Ramadi
[03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:35.560]  Fallujah they've got to hold them they've got to get into Mosul now okay it's gonna
[03:41:35.560 --> 03:41:38.600]  be these other people we don't want to see Americans there do you understand
[03:41:38.600 --> 03:41:43.400]  that was a key part of what was involved when she left those people in
[03:41:43.400 --> 03:41:49.960]  Benghazi stranded to die for 13 hours she didn't want the optics of having more
[03:41:49.960 --> 03:41:54.480]  American soldiers go remember they changed uniforms multiple times clothes
[03:41:54.480 --> 03:41:57.760]  multiple times I don't know you know would it be appropriate should they
[03:41:57.760 --> 03:42:01.840]  dress as soldiers you know maybe we should have them dressed as circus
[03:42:01.840 --> 03:42:05.560]  clowns or something so we don't offend people they kept changing their
[03:42:05.560 --> 03:42:09.600]  clothes they delayed it they didn't want to send very many people there
[03:42:09.600 --> 03:42:13.960]  because of the optics of all of this okay this is what she's talking about the
[03:42:13.960 --> 03:42:19.400]  woman cannot be trusted to be a commander-in-chief okay you cannot
[03:42:19.400 --> 03:42:24.520]  defeat ISIS by hurling microaggressions at them and she's not even willing to do
[03:42:24.520 --> 03:42:30.080]  that she takes these people who support Sharia law and she has them introduce
[03:42:30.080 --> 03:42:34.920]  her on the podium as she's accepting the nomination for president that's what
[03:42:34.920 --> 03:42:39.360]  Sharia Khan did okay this is a guy who has spent most of his he's a Sharia
[03:42:39.360 --> 03:42:43.160]  lawyer okay he gets people in this country but he has written commentaries
[03:42:43.160 --> 03:42:48.080]  on Sharia law which is the antithesis of what our Constitution is about what
[03:42:48.080 --> 03:42:52.880]  our soldiers fight for and yet she has that man introduce her hold him forth
[03:42:52.880 --> 03:42:57.920]  as a gold star family and as Joe Biggs has mentioned many times you're going to
[03:42:57.920 --> 03:43:02.720]  say that Donald Trump when he fights back against this Sharia pushing lawyer
[03:43:02.720 --> 03:43:06.760]  who attacked him you're gonna say he's disrespecting gold star families what
[03:43:06.760 --> 03:43:10.880]  about the gold star families that Hillary Clinton disrespected associated
[03:43:10.880 --> 03:43:17.360]  with Benghazi leaving their families to die for optics and then lying to them
[03:43:17.360 --> 03:43:21.040]  repeatedly as she lied to the American public over Benghazi now the
[03:43:21.040 --> 03:43:26.200]  Washington Post goes on talking about this situation in Mosul and Iraq they
[03:43:26.200 --> 03:43:30.320]  say she's got two big problems with this no-ground troops pledge okay they say
[03:43:30.320 --> 03:43:33.920]  it's been a very uncomfortable subject for Hillary Clinton for a long time the
[03:43:33.920 --> 03:43:38.520]  Iraq war her vote to authorize the war alienated progressives against her and
[03:43:38.520 --> 03:43:42.440]  now what she tries to do is to say well you know Donald Trump was for the war
[03:43:42.440 --> 03:43:47.280]  before he was against it there's a big difference between an offhand remark that
[03:43:47.280 --> 03:43:51.160]  he made when he was asked about this on the radio by Howard Stern he goes well
[03:43:51.160 --> 03:43:54.160]  you know we never did finish didn't do it right the first time maybe they should
[03:43:54.160 --> 03:43:57.360]  go back and then he looks at it more carefully says you know that's wrong and
[03:43:57.360 --> 03:44:00.640]  he made a very strong statement for a very long time about that she however
[03:44:00.640 --> 03:44:06.080]  was a US senator with information with a decision to make it was her decision to
[03:44:06.080 --> 03:44:11.200]  make as to whether they should go in she and the other senators she needed to do
[03:44:11.200 --> 03:44:17.160]  the research on it she didn't bother to do the research on it and she was the
[03:44:17.160 --> 03:44:21.360]  one responsible she had the vote and the responsibility to know what she was
[03:44:21.360 --> 03:44:25.160]  voting for so she goes on says well they're not going to get ground troops
[03:44:25.160 --> 03:44:28.960]  are not going to put ground troops in Iraq ever again and the Washington Post
[03:44:28.960 --> 03:44:33.600]  points out she said it four times clearly they said this was a message that she
[03:44:33.600 --> 03:44:37.800]  intended to deliver and then she again elaborated it yesterday on the news
[03:44:37.800 --> 03:44:41.440]  conference on Thursday following what she'd said on Wednesday nights commander
[03:44:41.440 --> 03:44:45.240]  in chief forum she doubled down on it and they say well the first problem is
[03:44:45.240 --> 03:44:51.000]  that there are already ground troops in Iraq and Syria the second is that in
[03:44:51.000 --> 03:44:55.920]  recent months generals have asked for even more maybe she doesn't respect the
[03:44:55.920 --> 03:45:00.280]  judgment of generals who are commanding the troops under the Obama administration
[03:45:00.280 --> 03:45:06.320]  and if we need to do something differently why why doesn't Obama do it
[03:45:06.320 --> 03:45:11.040]  now people should ask okay if things need to be changed why wait until Hillary
[03:45:11.040 --> 03:45:14.960]  becomes president anyway they go on to say the administration stresses that
[03:45:14.960 --> 03:45:18.440]  these troops are training Iraqis and serving in advisory capacities not
[03:45:18.440 --> 03:45:23.000]  combat troops but the Washington Post points out they are on the ground and
[03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:27.200]  let me ask you if you really believe that they're simply in advisory positions
[03:45:27.200 --> 03:45:34.680]  this is military.com yesterday 450 more troops arrived in Iraq to back a
[03:45:34.680 --> 03:45:40.880]  Mosul drive they say that Air Force Colonel John Dorian declined to give a
[03:45:40.880 --> 03:45:43.640]  time frame for the start of the offensive but he said we're going to have
[03:45:43.640 --> 03:45:47.600]  to get started soon if Mosul will be rested from the Islamic State of Iraq
[03:45:47.600 --> 03:45:53.160]  and Syria by the end of this year Army Lieutenant General Townsend Task Force
[03:45:53.160 --> 03:45:57.520]  commander appeared to suggest in a Wall Street Journal interview that the Mosul
[03:45:57.520 --> 03:46:03.520]  offensive could begin as early as next month okay this is 400 additional troops
[03:46:03.520 --> 03:46:10.040]  to boost the total number of US troops in Iraq from 4,000 to 4450 do we have
[03:46:10.040 --> 03:46:16.400]  that many advisors 4,000 troops it's roughly the number of ISIS troops
[03:46:16.400 --> 03:46:23.200]  that are in Mosul so I don't think that they are simply advisors now one of the
[03:46:23.200 --> 03:46:26.840]  things that Donald Trump is criticized for and I've criticized him myself for
[03:46:26.840 --> 03:46:31.840]  this is not being focused enough on civil liberties today he focused on civil
[03:46:31.840 --> 03:46:35.840]  liberties he focused on a very important civil liberty that has been violated for
[03:46:35.840 --> 03:46:40.360]  quite some time and that is the first amendment or the first amendment talks
[03:46:40.360 --> 03:46:45.680]  about two things doesn't it that talks about freedom of political speech and it
[03:46:45.680 --> 03:46:50.240]  talks about the free exercise a religion not that you can hold a belief but
[03:46:50.240 --> 03:46:56.240]  that you have the right to exercise that belief actually do your religion you
[03:46:56.240 --> 03:47:00.280]  don't do it in a closet folks you can actually exercise that religion and so
[03:47:00.280 --> 03:47:03.960]  it isn't it interesting that when the first amendment has these two components
[03:47:03.960 --> 03:47:10.240]  religious liberty and free speech that we would have the IRS under the
[03:47:10.240 --> 03:47:15.240]  direction and the amendment that was put in by Lyndon Johnson try to divide
[03:47:15.240 --> 03:47:20.320]  those two from each other you can't you can't divide those two and if you know
[03:47:20.320 --> 03:47:25.680]  history you know that an important part of the American Revolution was the
[03:47:25.680 --> 03:47:30.520]  black robe regiment okay the clergy who talked to people about what was going
[03:47:30.520 --> 03:47:35.520]  they understood what had happened in England they had been the subject of
[03:47:35.520 --> 03:47:40.040]  religious persecution America was largely founded by people who came to this
[03:47:40.040 --> 03:47:44.120]  country because they wanted religious liberty that's why it's the first
[03:47:44.120 --> 03:47:49.720]  amendment we have of the individual Bill of Rights in the Constitution and where
[03:47:49.720 --> 03:47:54.400]  did this all come from how did we get to a situation where churches have a gag
[03:47:54.400 --> 03:47:58.840]  order on them and we've talked about this many times they rope a dope you in
[03:47:58.840 --> 03:48:02.880]  with your subsidy with your tax deductions they say if you organize
[03:48:02.880 --> 03:48:07.360]  yourself as a corporation as a 501c corporation churches we will give you
[03:48:07.360 --> 03:48:14.560]  tax benefits and then they will use those strings attached to the tax benefits
[03:48:14.560 --> 03:48:19.200]  to gag you from political speech that's the way this has worked out and most
[03:48:19.200 --> 03:48:22.200]  churches are organized like that they're very concerned they're going to lose
[03:48:22.200 --> 03:48:27.120]  that tax deduction that it would go back and all the people who had donated
[03:48:27.120 --> 03:48:31.240]  money to the church would get audited so they organize themselves as a
[03:48:31.240 --> 03:48:35.280]  corporation in obedience to the IRS rather than standing up to them there
[03:48:35.280 --> 03:48:38.400]  are some brave individuals and a brave organization that has stood up to them
[03:48:38.400 --> 03:48:42.920]  they've organized pulpit freedom Sunday they do that every year and it began as
[03:48:42.920 --> 03:48:47.440]  just a handful of people who recorded their political expressly political
[03:48:47.440 --> 03:48:53.640]  speeches in the pulpit recorded those sent it to the IRS and said do something
[03:48:53.640 --> 03:48:59.280]  about it if you have the authority that is key folks and I'm telling you that if
[03:48:59.280 --> 03:49:03.600]  we get our freedoms back it's going to be led by the black robe regiment again
[03:49:03.600 --> 03:49:08.280]  they have the guts on these people who are exercising pulpit freedom Sunday and
[03:49:08.280 --> 03:49:11.240]  it's now spread to several hundred who have done this over the last couple years
[03:49:11.240 --> 03:49:16.840]  and guess what the IRS hasn't done anything you had the lesbian mayor of
[03:49:16.840 --> 03:49:20.920]  Houston try to shut down churches when they started pushing some of this
[03:49:20.920 --> 03:49:26.520]  transgender stuff with bathrooms and other issues in Houston and demanding
[03:49:26.520 --> 03:49:32.920]  that they send their their their sermons to her to be looked at and they
[03:49:32.920 --> 03:49:38.680]  refused we're not going to do it you don't have to submit to tyranny and
[03:49:38.680 --> 03:49:42.760]  wouldn't it be great if we had church leaders if we had pastors if we had
[03:49:42.760 --> 03:49:47.600]  people who would stand up and call this bluff I don't care where it comes from
[03:49:47.600 --> 03:49:52.240]  it'd be great if the churches would do this for the people who are in their
[03:49:52.240 --> 03:49:56.040]  flock so the new american talks about this and they said on Friday family
[03:49:56.040 --> 03:49:59.600]  research councils convention in Washington DC Donald Trump is expected to
[03:49:59.600 --> 03:50:04.720]  reiterate his call to repeal the Lyndon Johnson amendment in line with a similar
[03:50:04.720 --> 03:50:10.400]  call in the GOP platform his speech will say you have so much to contribute to our
[03:50:10.400 --> 03:50:14.440]  politics yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own
[03:50:14.440 --> 03:50:18.880]  puppets an amendment pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago threatens
[03:50:18.880 --> 03:50:23.240]  religious institutions with a loss of their tax exempt status if they openly
[03:50:23.240 --> 03:50:28.080]  advocate their political views Trump said I am going to work very hard to
[03:50:28.080 --> 03:50:32.480]  repeal that language to protect free speech for all Americans and where did
[03:50:32.480 --> 03:50:36.560]  this come from this came from Lyndon Johnson why he wanted to punish
[03:50:36.560 --> 03:50:42.320]  churches who had talked about his shady background so when he won the election
[03:50:42.320 --> 03:50:47.280]  he did this as punishment to churches and most churches have abided by that
[03:50:47.280 --> 03:50:51.800]  gag order all of this time yet Donald Trump is going to stand up against that
[03:50:51.800 --> 03:50:55.360]  stand up for the First Amendment how about that isn't that interesting
[03:50:55.360 --> 03:51:00.120]  standing up for civil liberties in a way that Gary Johnson the libertarian
[03:51:00.120 --> 03:51:04.560]  won't are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals are you happy

[03:54:11.880 --> 03:54:16.080]  welcome back to our last segment of the fourth hour I'm David Knight here in the
[03:54:16.080 --> 03:54:21.280]  Alex Jones radio show and we're going to talk about another effect from Trump
[03:54:21.280 --> 03:54:25.960]  and that is the bill that has been unanimously passed today in the house
[03:54:25.960 --> 03:54:31.960]  that will allow 9-11 families to do lawsuits against Saudi Arabia and of
[03:54:31.960 --> 03:54:38.040]  course the Democrats hate it the Republicans hate it at the top this is
[03:54:38.040 --> 03:54:42.000]  something that now has widespread support however why did that happen how did
[03:54:42.000 --> 03:54:45.960]  that happen all of a sudden and of course they're saying well you know Obama is in
[03:54:45.960 --> 03:54:50.880]  a dilemma now with the Saudis he is very concerned about this and he has
[03:54:50.880 --> 03:54:55.160]  threatened to veto this he said there's absolutely no way said White House
[03:54:55.160 --> 03:54:59.040]  spokesman Josh Ernest that I could envision President Obama signing this
[03:54:59.040 --> 03:55:04.200]  bill nevertheless the pushback now has grown so large they don't think that he's
[03:55:04.200 --> 03:55:08.120]  going to be able to over that they will be able to override his veto if he does
[03:55:08.120 --> 03:55:11.600]  decide to veto it it'd be the first time that has happened how did it get to that
[03:55:11.600 --> 03:55:16.200]  point remember nobody was talking about this until Trump started talking about
[03:55:16.200 --> 03:55:22.440]  the missing 28 pages that turned things around there have been huge changes right
[03:55:22.440 --> 03:55:27.840]  now in the body politic even without Donald Trump being elected president and
[03:55:27.840 --> 03:55:31.200]  I think very positive changes that have been happening here with us these are
[03:55:31.200 --> 03:55:36.000]  people like John Bolton former UN ambassador who put who are complaining
[03:55:36.000 --> 03:55:41.200]  about this a Bush official as well as Obama who put the well-being of the
[03:55:41.200 --> 03:55:45.880]  Saudis ahead of that of the 9-11 families we have a right to know what
[03:55:45.880 --> 03:55:50.480]  happened and we have a right for those families to be compensated for what they
[03:55:50.480 --> 03:55:54.480]  allowed to happen what they allowed to happen you have to understand that and
[03:55:54.480 --> 03:55:59.040]  we can thank Donald Trump for making this an issue and for turning around public
[03:55:59.040 --> 03:56:03.680]  opinion to the extent that even the united leadership of the two mainstream
[03:56:03.680 --> 03:56:06.680]  parties cannot stop it now real quickly I've got some other news I want to talk
[03:56:06.680 --> 03:56:10.640]  about with George Soros's open foundation supporting online voting before I do
[03:56:10.640 --> 03:56:14.280]  real quickly I want to let you know that we have a Mr. Rachel Maddow special that
[03:56:14.280 --> 03:56:19.560]  we've put up in honor of him or her talking about how we finance our
[03:56:19.560 --> 03:56:23.680]  operation you know why we sell our own products like this because we don't want
[03:56:23.680 --> 03:56:28.280]  to sell you something that we don't believe in Alex very carefully vets
[03:56:28.280 --> 03:56:32.720]  these products he puts out stuff that we are proud to sell it supports our
[03:56:32.720 --> 03:56:35.560]  operation it's an honest thing that we do we're not taking money from the
[03:56:35.560 --> 03:56:40.340]  government like MSNBC we're not pushing pharmaceuticals that harm people like
[03:56:40.340 --> 03:56:45.720]  most of the major networks do we are selling products like air filters and
[03:56:45.720 --> 03:56:49.880]  water filters you know those conspiracies that you need clean air clean
[03:56:49.880 --> 03:56:54.520]  water we've got 20% off of those at info wars store.com and we have the
[03:56:54.520 --> 03:56:59.620]  Mr. Rachel Maddow special and his or her honor 20% off surviving survival

[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:17.840]  I guess but we do sell that and it will last made in the USA no GMOs no
[03:57:17.840 --> 03:57:22.760]  preservatives but it will still last for 25 years again 30 to 40% off of that
[03:57:22.760 --> 03:57:27.200]  many other preparedness specials you'll find at info wars store.com that
[03:57:27.200 --> 03:57:31.160]  will be ending soon although we'll extend that Rachel Maddow sell for a while
[03:57:31.160 --> 03:57:36.920]  now real quickly at the top of dredge today an article exposing how the
[03:57:36.920 --> 03:57:41.280]  George Soros Foundation is seeking to expand online voting understand the
[03:57:41.280 --> 03:57:45.720]  many different ways that the Democrats have tried in the past to rig voting
[03:57:45.720 --> 03:57:52.360]  early voting no voter ID etc etc but key amongst all these is going to be
[03:57:52.360 --> 03:57:57.320]  online voting at the very time we've got all of this information everybody
[03:57:57.320 --> 03:58:01.800]  should be concerned about the security of things online and yet what they want
[03:58:01.800 --> 03:58:06.600]  to do is make it easier to manipulate to hack this for their benefit and of
[03:58:06.600 --> 03:58:11.320]  course the Breitbart article draws together the connections between the
[03:58:11.320 --> 03:58:14.680]  George Soros Open Society Foundation talking about how they're going to
[03:58:14.680 --> 03:58:20.000]  support Obama's executive orders and how they're going to create another power
[03:58:20.000 --> 03:58:23.840]  base by creating online voting we've seen it all before we've seen smart
