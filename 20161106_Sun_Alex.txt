[00:00.000 --> 00:08.720]  Wow, folks. Wow. I am so blown away right now. Hillary had LeBron James come speak at
[00:08.720 --> 00:12.680]  one of her rallies. All she got was 700 people. They were almost all white, even though they
[00:12.680 --> 00:16.800]  were trying to get black folks to come to it. And it gets even worse than that. As you
[00:16.800 --> 00:22.640]  know, she has a JZ concert and 10,000 show up. I mean, Trump has 20, 30,000. This shows
[00:22.640 --> 00:26.760]  how rigged it is. We've got incredible news with the FBI coming out and saying, Hey, we're
[00:26.760 --> 00:31.140]  not going to go after Hillary on the new emails. But first, a very powerful John Bowne
[00:31.140 --> 00:37.800]  report, Marina Abramovich, grandmother of the performance art movement and a modern adherent
[00:37.800 --> 00:43.600]  to ceremonial magic found in Alistair Crowley's religion, the Lima wrote a very personal email
[00:43.600 --> 00:49.440]  to Tony Podesta, according to WikiLeaks. It reads, Dear Tony, I am so looking forward
[00:49.440 --> 00:54.220]  to the spirit cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know
[00:54.220 --> 01:01.120]  if your brother is joining Tony Podesta, regarded as the most powerful lobbyist in Washington,
[01:01.120 --> 01:06.840]  DC is a brother to none other than John Podesta, chairman of the Hillary Clinton presidential
[01:06.840 --> 01:12.960]  campaign and counselor to President Obama. That dinner Abramovich spoke of was nothing
[01:12.960 --> 01:19.440]  less than a thalemic occult ritual in spirit cooking. Marina uses pigs blood, which most
[01:19.440 --> 01:25.760]  resembles human blood as a medium to connect the spirit world with the material world.
[01:25.760 --> 01:30.280]  The ritual takes place in the kitchen, which is considered to be the heart of the home.
[01:30.280 --> 01:36.600]  The goal of the ceremony is to convert matter into energy so spirits can feed on it. Marina
[01:36.600 --> 01:42.360]  derives her inspiration from the popular belief that spirits still need food, even though
[01:42.360 --> 01:49.080]  it is no longer solid, but in the form of light, sound and emotions. This simple revelation
[01:49.080 --> 01:55.560]  may finally pull back the curtain to the masses on the ugly truth. Infowars and others have
[01:55.560 --> 01:59.720]  been desperately trying to tell the masses for years.
[01:59.720 --> 02:05.680]  The occult is the religion of the elite. Just research the influence of Lucius trust in
[02:05.680 --> 02:12.680]  the United Nations or review the 1990 Nebraska U.S. District Court case between Paul A. Baraki
[02:12.680 --> 02:19.200]  vs. Lawrence E. King, exposing a powerful pedophile ring linked to political figures, high level
[02:19.200 --> 02:24.760]  U.S. military commanders and the intelligence establishment. All of this overseen by Temple
[02:24.760 --> 02:30.400]  of Set founder and retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Michael Aquino. Bill Clinton and
[02:30.400 --> 02:36.560]  Hillary Clinton live in this dark world. Bill Clinton wrote in his biography that the brief
[02:36.560 --> 02:42.320]  foray into the world of Voodoo furthered his fascination with the way different cultures
[02:42.320 --> 02:47.400]  try to make sense of life, nature, and the virtually universal belief that there is a
[02:47.400 --> 02:51.240]  non-physical spirit force at work in the world.
[02:51.240 --> 02:57.400]  Back in September 16, 2016, Fox News posted a letter from hacker Guccifer claiming the
[02:57.400 --> 03:03.040]  goal of the Guccifer project failed because he was unable to fully expose the Illuminati,
[03:03.040 --> 03:09.720]  the council and their crimes. He writes, Hillary Rodham Diane Clinton is one of the high priests,
[03:09.720 --> 03:15.960]  a goddess of this occult satanic shadow group. One must see their evil and profoundly corrupt
[03:15.960 --> 03:21.720]  nature to understand what I am talking about. Guccifer continues, So I apologize in front
[03:21.720 --> 03:27.440]  of the unknown soldiers who struggle to take this fight against these monsters to a glorious
[03:27.440 --> 03:32.160]  end. Many of them are risking their lives while doing this behind the computer screens
[03:32.160 --> 03:38.480]  from inside or outside the system. And now bombshell revelations are surfacing from
[03:38.480 --> 03:44.480]  Anthony Wiener's recovered laptop as the New York police department is investigating allegations
[03:44.480 --> 03:51.680]  that Bill Clinton performed sexual acts on underage girls as young as five years old.
[03:51.680 --> 03:57.480]  In the coming days, right up to the election, Anthony Wiener's laptop will reveal evidence
[03:57.480 --> 04:03.400]  of an international child sex trafficking bring tied to Democratic presidential candidate
[04:03.400 --> 04:09.400]  Hillary Clinton. She's worked like a demon, as you know, with Secretary of State and as
[04:09.400 --> 04:16.040]  a senator and in the years since. One thing about Hillary, they were just a good timing
[04:16.040 --> 04:26.840]  guy. With Hillary, she's an animal. Hillary is the one that I promise you. She pulls the
[04:26.840 --> 04:32.640]  strings. She pulled them in Arkansas. She pulled them in the White House when she was
[04:32.640 --> 04:41.760]  there as the first lady. In my God, if she gets to be president, what you see out here
[04:41.760 --> 04:46.680]  now is going to change. We thought it changed with Obama. There's nothing compared to what's
[04:46.680 --> 04:52.720]  going to happen with Hillary. If all of this is just a little too much, remember Benjamin
[04:52.720 --> 04:58.800]  Franklin prophetically said only a virtuous people can run their own affairs will be back.
[04:58.800 --> 05:03.120]  I'm Alex Jones with a simple question. Will you and your family be financially protected
[05:03.120 --> 05:07.240]  if there's another economic meltdown? Like many experts, I believe another devastating
[05:07.240 --> 05:11.800]  crash is coming. I think it's a matter of when, not if. Don't wait for another crisis
[05:11.800 --> 05:15.440]  that could wipe out your hard earned money. Do what I did and call United States Gold
[05:15.440 --> 05:22.340]  Vault at 844-541-ALEX. It's a company I trust. They're offering gold and silver coin survival
[05:22.340 --> 05:27.160]  packs that could help safeguard your money in an economic meltdown. I'm talking real
[05:27.160 --> 05:31.400]  money, not paper or worthless stocks. China recently bought more than a billion dollars
[05:31.400 --> 05:36.760]  worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move. Gold and silver are recognized worldwide
[05:36.760 --> 05:42.920]  as one of the most stable means of protecting finances. Don't delay call 844-541-ALEX now
[05:42.920 --> 05:47.720]  and get a rugged double locked bank bag to securely store your coins absolutely free.
[05:47.720 --> 05:52.920]  These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority. I personally
[05:52.920 --> 05:59.920]  owe me survival packs and you should too. Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALEX now.
[06:22.920 --> 06:29.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now only two days out from the most historic election in
[06:34.800 --> 06:41.560]  US history. The stakes could not be higher. Now, obviously in the last two hours the FBI
[06:41.560 --> 06:47.640]  director came out, James Comey, and said that she's completely exonerated in all the emails
[06:47.640 --> 06:52.360]  basically forever. This is when new WikiLeaks emails have come out, showing they lied to
[06:52.360 --> 06:57.480]  Congress and the FBI and were quote, covering up evidence. But see, they diverted the public
[06:57.480 --> 07:04.480]  into the 650,000 on Anthony Weiner's laptop and Uma Abedin, Hillary's girlfriend. And
[07:08.760 --> 07:14.440]  we had Larry Nichols, the former top Clinton operative on last Sunday, joining us again.
[07:14.440 --> 07:21.280]  He said word for word, Alex, they're setting Trump up next Saturday or Sunday. Comey will
[07:21.280 --> 07:25.520]  come out and complete the exonerated. Now we're going to play that clip for you from
[07:25.520 --> 07:32.520]  last Sunday. But I mean, we have the insiders. I talked to a Pentagon insider. I talked to
[07:34.200 --> 07:41.200]  a former high level CIA official today and they all told me the same thing. The military
[07:42.560 --> 07:48.720]  is being told stand down. Hillary is going to be installed. Now, if you want to know
[07:48.720 --> 07:53.880]  how James Bondi this is before I get to any of this news, I'm sitting here. We've got
[07:53.880 --> 07:59.440]  a bunch of TV networks, CNN, Fox News, you name it on. It's LeBron James of the Cleveland
[07:59.440 --> 08:06.440]  Cavaliers with Hillary with close up shots. I sit down 15 minutes for airtime and I'm
[08:06.440 --> 08:13.440]  sent a photo by let's just say insiders on the Cleveland police department to my phone.
[08:20.720 --> 08:24.280]  Document cam please for TV viewers. I'll describe radio listeners. This is the crowd
[08:24.280 --> 08:30.160]  that was there when LeBron James spoke and I said 700. I was corrected. I went back and
[08:30.160 --> 08:37.160]  messaged the crowd is 300. Now, if you actually watched the newscast, even on Fox, they would
[08:41.580 --> 08:47.640]  not show you this. It was LeBron bowing up. It was a rock star party. These are total
[08:47.640 --> 08:51.600]  winners. And meanwhile, the police are sitting there running security, sending me this photo.
[08:51.600 --> 08:58.600]  This was sent by high level. Okay, let's just say that high level. Now, that's what's going
[09:01.640 --> 09:08.640]  on in this country. Literally a tiny crowd of a couple hundred in front, maybe a hundred
[09:08.840 --> 09:14.940]  or so behind her with close shots to create the illusion that she's really the coolest
[09:14.940 --> 09:18.640]  person to vote for because, you know, she's hanging out with folks in the hood like LeBron
[09:18.640 --> 09:23.880]  James. I mean, this is the ultimate joke. LeBron James was going to cancel. I was told
[09:23.880 --> 09:28.840]  by our police sources, but then Hillary threw a complete fit and the word is they were basically
[09:28.840 --> 09:35.840]  paying people off the street to come in. Now, they also fell in their face because they
[09:36.600 --> 09:41.040]  tried for a week to recruit in mainly black areas and hardly any black folks showed up
[09:41.040 --> 09:45.160]  and there's massive low black turn out right now being reported for Democrats and joining
[09:45.160 --> 09:50.440]  us is Roger Stone at the bottom of the hour on that front. So this is a landslide for
[09:50.440 --> 09:56.000]  Trump, but they are agendaing to steal it. This is confirmed. This is so historical what
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.520]  we're living through. Now, let me just stop right there. If you think I'm joking about
[10:00.520 --> 10:05.120]  it and you're a radio listener about the crowd of 300 she had, I just showed the photo to
[10:05.120 --> 10:12.280]  TV viewers and then showed you the mainstream media with close up shots to deceive the public.
[10:12.280 --> 10:17.800]  You can go to our Facebook from last night from the special broadcast we did one video
[10:17.800 --> 10:22.480]  archive from us live last night for four hours. Guess how many views it has? We can pull it
[10:22.480 --> 10:28.680]  up on Alex Jones's Facebook right now. Just go to Alexander Emerson's Facebook, see the
[10:28.680 --> 10:35.680]  video box area. You scroll down. There you go. That's it. 837,000 views. They broke
[10:36.960 --> 10:40.280]  the video in twos. Another one with 300 and a couple. So when I say a million, it's actually
[10:40.280 --> 10:46.480]  a million two, but there it is. One video, 837,000 views on YouTube, 200,000 on our
[10:46.480 --> 10:52.920]  internal streams, 400 plus thousand people. How many millions is that? Two and a half
[10:52.920 --> 10:57.200]  million or so. We have two and a half million viewers last night separate from even my
[10:57.200 --> 11:03.840]  threshold radio show. If you go to Hillary's Facebook mentions, because only quote celebrities
[11:03.840 --> 11:07.800]  get them. It's not the Facebook live thing. It's Facebook mentions. So we're celebrities.
[11:07.800 --> 11:12.180]  So we get one. When you go to hers right now, guess how many watched today live with LeBron
[11:12.180 --> 11:19.180]  James through now? Cause it counts live and then afterwards that watch the archive. 5,500
[11:21.840 --> 11:27.760]  as of 12 minutes ago before I went live. Donald Trump has crowds of 30, 40, 50,000 people
[11:27.760 --> 11:33.800]  on average 10,000 in small towns because he averages between big towns and small towns.
[11:33.800 --> 11:40.520]  Hillary has 300 people. They have to do ultra close shots. Let me show TV viewers again.
[11:40.520 --> 11:47.520]  We're showing their ultra close shot of the crowd. Now back out sent to us by the Cleveland
[11:49.200 --> 11:56.200]  police department. That's the wide shot. And notice they know exactly what to send us.
[11:56.200 --> 12:06.200]  Didn't ask for it. Nothing. They know exactly what we'd need. Ladies and gentlemen, this
[12:06.200 --> 12:13.200]  is massive, massive fraud. You go to her site. You go to the video. You can see it and you've
[12:17.600 --> 12:20.740]  got all of her videos combined. It's like something like 6 million views and they're
[12:20.740 --> 12:24.840]  pumping it. But the main one LeBron James on stage. That one says 6.5 million. One LeBron
[12:24.840 --> 12:30.920]  James says 5,000. That's another compilation video. The point is that they are pushing
[12:30.920 --> 12:37.120]  this with Facebook and Zuckerberg and everybody totally behind them and they're in total panic
[12:37.120 --> 12:41.600]  mode. But when Hillary puts out a full hour long video, 5,000 watch it. Little 20 second
[12:41.600 --> 12:48.200]  snips for people that have no attention span, 6 million. And info wars is only one small
[12:48.200 --> 12:52.320]  part of this, but this is the whole media. Every TV channel forced feeding you to go
[12:52.320 --> 12:59.080]  watch this. And what they're giving you is close up, blown up shots. It just shows what
[12:59.080 --> 13:03.320]  the WikiLeaks show, how rigged it is, how they're rigging the polls, how they're rigging
[13:03.320 --> 13:12.320]  the numbers, how they're rigging on every single front. These issues and how stupid they think
[13:12.320 --> 13:19.000]  you are. Now that said, I don't know what's going to happen in two days. You can say technically
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.520]  it's just the rest of the day in tomorrow and then it's election day, but it's a little
[13:22.520 --> 13:28.920]  more than 48 hours until we're in the thick of the election. And we know Bev Harris who's
[13:28.920 --> 13:33.880]  bipartisan. She's a Democrat. She said Hillary is clearly going to steal it. They're not
[13:33.880 --> 13:38.720]  going to let Trump win, but he is the leader. The fraud is in with this fraction, fractionating
[13:38.720 --> 13:43.480]  thing they're doing. Then they've caught him in the programs. Then a WikiLeaks comes
[13:43.480 --> 13:50.600]  out today and says they're not going to allow Trump to win the fixes in. He is a big liberal.
[13:50.600 --> 13:55.600]  Any real liberal just wants to have integrity in our voting system and is admitting massive
[13:55.600 --> 13:59.480]  vote fraud is now happening. Want to go watch your full report? Biggest elections fraud
[13:59.480 --> 14:03.000]  in history is covered in the United States. That was from last Monday. Seems like a hundred
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.080]  years ago. Time now was moving super quick. Now it's moving like really fast, but also
[14:08.080 --> 14:12.200]  super slow. You know what I mean? It's like we're moving forward really fast. But I look
[14:12.200 --> 14:22.040]  back in time a week ago, seems like 20 years ago. So so much is unfolding. So much is happening.
[14:22.040 --> 14:26.840]  And this is such a huge town to be alive. But here's the bottom line. Larry Nichols,
[14:26.840 --> 14:33.280]  we're going to play the clip when we come back, came out and he said, well, he called
[14:33.280 --> 14:37.480]  me last Friday. I talked to him Saturday and Sunday and talked to other sources. He talked
[14:37.480 --> 14:45.320]  to Supreme Court justice and others. And he said, I don't know. The military is going
[14:45.320 --> 14:48.840]  to do something or anybody else. But as it stands, and I don't want to demoralize people,
[14:48.840 --> 14:54.240]  but they're going to give it to her. Trump's winning my landslide. But Alex is stealing
[14:54.240 --> 15:03.960]  it in Philadelphia and Cleveland and Miami, Alex and Comey will announce on Saturday or
[15:03.960 --> 15:09.320]  Sunday that she's totally exonerated. Watch. Then he came on air and basically said the
[15:09.320 --> 15:15.400]  same thing. And you're just sitting here watching the country stolen in front of you. And with
[15:15.400 --> 15:20.360]  all these poor, sad, lottery ticket mentality people that wanted free healthcare and wanted
[15:20.360 --> 15:23.640]  this and that, and they have no idea it was always a screw job. It was always meant to
[15:23.640 --> 15:28.680]  be a screw job. And then Gruber and others go on TV and make fun of you. And now when
[15:28.680 --> 15:34.120]  we come back, even for the Larry Nichols, the Washington Post, all of them are now celebrating
[15:34.120 --> 15:39.760]  and they said, yes, non-citizens will decide the election. They are voting and there's
[15:39.760 --> 15:43.720]  nothing you can do to stop it. So they're going to have this big celebration to collapse
[15:43.720 --> 15:48.640]  our borders more, bring in more Third World and just basically, I guess, make Americans
[15:48.640 --> 15:55.640]  slaves. I mean, I mean, it's on folks. It is all being announced and Obama said it's
[15:55.640 --> 15:58.120]  okay for illegals to vote.

[18:58.400 --> 19:03.360]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's
[19:03.360 --> 19:08.320]  talking about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid. The potential
[19:08.320 --> 19:15.320]  for power grid chaos. EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather, hurricanes,
[19:15.320 --> 19:20.720]  ice storms, all a very real threat to our grid. My friend's chaos is already here and
[19:20.720 --> 19:24.880]  it's going to get a lot worse. That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have

[20:08.120 --> 20:13.120]  We've got it.
[20:13.120 --> 20:18.120]  Waging war on corruption.
[20:18.120 --> 20:25.120]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[20:25.120 --> 20:32.120]  Stories up on rugsreports.com. It's from the great folks over at Gateway Pundit who did
[20:39.520 --> 20:46.520]  their research. Guess who shouted out reportedly gun and made a run at Trump to make him look
[20:46.520 --> 20:51.200]  like a fool and a coward. Which he wasn't. He stood there very strong until the Secret
[20:51.200 --> 20:56.200]  Service forcefully took him off the stage. He came right back. It's a bird dogger. A
[20:56.200 --> 21:02.800]  Democratic Party blogger operative. We can put it up on screen for TV viewers. So isn't
[21:02.800 --> 21:08.680]  that just special? That story is also, again, posted to infowars.com. Update. Trump attacker
[21:08.680 --> 21:12.880]  was bird dogger. That's in the WikiLeaks. You know, go out and attack people basically
[21:12.880 --> 21:16.920]  cause disturbance. Mentioned in WikiLeaks.
[21:16.920 --> 21:20.360]  So there you go. Oh, and there's another report in the Washington Post. The Washington
[21:20.360 --> 21:24.080]  Post finally, I guess cause the word came in, the fix is in for Hillary, they think.
[21:24.080 --> 21:28.160]  They've got to go ahead and act like they're distancing themselves from her because, you
[21:28.160 --> 21:31.360]  know, they've got to fight for her to get her in. But then once she's in, they can play
[21:31.360 --> 21:35.520]  the part of opposition and not lose all their readers. Well, too late, you're totally discredited.
[21:35.520 --> 21:40.440]  There's a new big, giant graphic image we should tweet out. And it's Hillary. And if
[21:40.440 --> 21:47.440]  you scroll down, Hillary Clinton's lying is the behavior of a sociopath. No, it goes
[21:47.440 --> 21:54.440]  a little bit further than that. In fact, I tweeted an image out today where folks found
[21:54.440 --> 22:00.520]  a photo of her that really crystallizes who she is, where she looks like a demonic clown.
[22:00.520 --> 22:04.160]  And that's what people that are around her closely describe her as is a very, very scary
[22:04.160 --> 22:11.160]  person. Now they have created such an upside down world that if I don't want to pay for
[22:11.160 --> 22:18.160]  a job, Ukrainian, Mexican, Chinese, Venezuelan, you name it, people to come in, have babies
[22:23.120 --> 22:28.000]  for free, get put on welfare, welfare is not enough to live on though. Then you go out
[22:28.000 --> 22:31.680]  and get a job and then drive down wages. You're not a bad person. I get why you're coming
[22:31.680 --> 22:35.680]  here. I would do if I was you. The point is it's designed not to even rise you up, but
[22:35.680 --> 22:40.960]  to create a permanent underclass. And then they've got the nerve to have all these states
[22:40.960 --> 22:45.080]  trying to pass laws. Some have done it, but not put it on the books. That is, the governor
[22:45.080 --> 22:51.440]  is designed in Illinois or California this year to let illegals vote. And now all over
[22:51.440 --> 22:58.440]  the big Spanish language channels, they have arrogant, entitled people going, if you live
[22:58.840 --> 23:03.800]  here, you're a citizen and you should be able to vote. Really. Can I go to Mexico or Venezuela
[23:03.800 --> 23:10.800]  or Ukraine or Nigeria and just show up and say, I've been here a year. I work here. You
[23:10.800 --> 23:17.800]  got to let me vote. They would kick your butt. But now the video is up on info wars.com.
[23:18.920 --> 23:25.840]  President Obama encourages illegals to vote, says there is no penalty. And if you vote,
[23:25.840 --> 23:30.040]  you're a citizen. He repeats what the pundit says. And in case you think this is some type
[23:30.040 --> 23:34.240]  of mental typo, it's all scripted because we've seen it literally in hundreds of articles.
[23:34.240 --> 23:40.040]  Here's the Washington Post. Could non-citizens decide the November election, just like to
[23:40.040 --> 23:47.040]  Bloomberg, the same day last week came out and said, illegals are voting nationwide,
[23:47.160 --> 23:52.360]  but Trump is still wrong about it and it doesn't exist. And it was designed to be mental illness
[23:52.360 --> 23:58.640]  and just totally confuse everyone and go, what? Because see, they want to get this now
[23:58.640 --> 24:02.160]  so inculcated that when illegals get caught voting, people go, okay, it's their right
[24:02.160 --> 24:08.520]  to. I mean, folks, if I showed up in Mexico, tried to walk in with a US ID card, tried
[24:08.520 --> 24:15.520]  to vote, they would kick my butt because they're still have common sense of nationalism, but
[24:15.520 --> 24:20.400]  only here. Oh, you just got here. Oh, here, everything's free and you can vote. What?
[24:20.400 --> 24:25.720]  This is total checkmate, folks. But again, it's a conspiracy theory. Alex Jones and Donald
[24:25.720 --> 24:32.720]  Trump are totally insane. It's totally racist. They're ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen,
[24:32.720 --> 24:39.720]  there is, listen to me, there is no law. If you vote, you're a citizen, even if you're
[24:40.040 --> 24:45.360]  not a citizen. This is the throwing it in your face. This is the crapping on you and
[24:45.360 --> 24:50.960]  rubbing it in. This is only going to get worse. This is like Alice in Wonderland Tea Party.
[24:50.960 --> 24:57.960]  It's so crazy. Here is Obama of the millennials dreamers undocumented citizens and I call
[24:57.960 --> 25:04.240]  them citizens because they contribute to this country are fearful of voting. So if I vote,
[25:04.240 --> 25:09.800]  will immigration know where I live? Will they come from my family and deport us? Not true.
[25:09.800 --> 25:16.800]  And the reason is, first of all, when you vote, you are a citizen yourself and there
[25:16.800 --> 25:21.920]  is not a situation where the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start
[25:21.920 --> 25:28.920]  investigating, etc. The same to the vote is strictly confidential.
[25:29.440 --> 25:36.440]  I can't believe I heard what I heard. The president is even questioning whether the
[25:37.160 --> 25:42.280]  person who is an illegal is voting outside of reminding people that if you're a citizen
[25:42.280 --> 25:48.200]  you vote, but it's very clear that the question is being asked was about illegals voting and
[25:48.200 --> 25:55.200]  afraid that they might be reported to border security. You're illegal. You cannot vote
[25:56.160 --> 25:59.680]  and the president of the United States is saying, don't worry, no one will be spying
[25:59.680 --> 26:03.720]  on you catching you. It was an encouragement. Whether you're for the president, against
[26:03.720 --> 26:08.880]  the president. Let's stop right there. This is all done on purpose. They're passing laws
[26:08.880 --> 26:14.000]  that illegals can vote that violate federal law and they can bring in enough people then
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.800]  give them free stuff and have checkmate. See, in a republic, it's a representative democracy,
[26:20.800 --> 26:27.080]  but there's checks and balances so the majority can't enslave the minority. Well, now, because
[26:27.080 --> 26:32.160]  Christians pass laws to try to end racism and things, the left couldn't beat that anymore
[26:32.160 --> 26:36.560]  and the Democrats, so they flipped it and now they're turning the minorities into gang-related,
[26:36.560 --> 26:41.520]  race-related control groups. Now, most quote minorities, who are really the majority in
[26:41.520 --> 26:47.680]  most areas, aren't even bad people, but regardless, everyone's basically whipped into accepting
[26:47.680 --> 26:54.680]  this. Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is total lawlessness. You have to understand that and
[26:56.560 --> 27:01.960]  I love the reporter. She's, because they are citizens, I mean, you know, they're contributing
[27:01.960 --> 27:05.600]  and she's so angry. She's so entitled. And if you said to her, well, can I go to Mexico
[27:05.600 --> 27:11.400]  or can I go to the Philippines and vote? Well, you're a misogynistic white pig, so no. But
[27:11.400 --> 27:16.960]  people of color, dude, the entitlement, the attack on logic, can we play the clip just
[27:16.960 --> 27:23.960]  the first few seconds again to hear just the hissing and the smacking of the lips and the
[27:25.280 --> 27:28.120]  over-the-top arrogance of this young woman? Here it is.
[27:28.120 --> 27:32.960]  Of the millennials, dreamers, undocumented citizens, and I call them citizens because
[27:32.960 --> 27:39.400]  they contribute to this country, are people of voting. So if I vote, will immigration
[27:39.400 --> 27:41.600]  know where I live? Well, they come from my family.
[27:41.600 --> 27:45.640]  Oh, yeah, that's right. She's this famous person that is a citizen. Again, again, stop
[27:45.640 --> 27:50.880]  right there. And they make people victims. That's not a citizen. And the big loving media
[27:50.880 --> 27:55.520]  and Goldman Sachs run system. Oh, it cares. No, it wants to exploit you. And they're
[27:55.520 --> 27:59.720]  going to bring down Europe and bring down the U.S. and bring down Japan and bring down
[27:59.720 --> 28:03.680]  South Korea, the few places that still have a middle class and then you have no hope,
[28:03.680 --> 28:08.000]  but you'll be dumbed down and poor so you will never know. And you'll be walled off forever
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.840]  as the jet copters fly above you off of their big walled, rural compounds while you live
[28:13.840 --> 28:19.760]  in big Gena 21 controlled cities. This is the admitted, globalist plan where you can't
[28:19.760 --> 28:23.920]  have a car, you can't have air conditioning, but it's liberal, so it's okay.
[28:23.920 --> 28:27.200]  We're going to come back with Roger Stone, but I have first, I'm going to play the clip
[28:27.200 --> 28:32.200]  of Larry Nichols. That guy is that guy's the real deal, folks. Let me just tell you,
[28:32.200 --> 28:37.400]  let me tell you that guy was in black ops for the CIA all over the world. And that guy
[28:37.400 --> 28:42.600]  was a hit man for the Clintons, okay? He was their handler. And then he wouldn't get along
[28:42.600 --> 28:46.160]  with killing kids. He's like Tony Montana, so they got rid of him. He exposed him. He
[28:46.160 --> 28:50.520]  knows every move because he trained him. We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen. He called it
[28:50.520 --> 29:19.520]  on the FBI. He dead nailed it a hundred percent. A hole in one.

[31:07.360 --> 31:11.720]  Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21 that American systems of justice
[31:11.720 --> 31:16.120]  must be changed to conform to the rest of the world. Individual rights will have to
[31:16.120 --> 31:20.120]  take a back seat, do the collective. Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't
[31:20.120 --> 31:23.680]  you? It's gonna be coming after you're done. Oh, yeah. I take it ain't gonna sit well
[31:23.680 --> 31:29.000]  down my way. At all. It ain't gonna sit well. Do you ever wonder what happened to America?

[33:02.080 --> 33:09.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:09.080 --> 33:22.080]  Hello. This is Hank Hill. And I'm telling you what. You need to listen to Alex Jones
[33:22.080 --> 33:36.080]  in infowarsteam.com. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[33:36.080 --> 33:44.800]  All right. Coming up, we're going to have Roger Stone on with us. He's on NBC News right
[33:44.800 --> 33:49.680]  now. They're talking about the fact that a federal court did say no. Donald Trump and
[33:49.680 --> 33:54.600]  Roger Stone's poll watching program and exit poll program is not voter intimidation. So
[33:54.600 --> 34:00.760]  that's been struck down. There is massive evidence of election fraud pouring in. Larry
[34:00.760 --> 34:05.040]  Nichols is warned of this. Again, explain how they bust the people around to vote. Now
[34:05.040 --> 34:09.280]  we have all these election officials and Democrats admitting they have people voting 10 times
[34:09.280 --> 34:14.320]  a piece. We have the Washington Post saying, of course, illegals are voting. They're going
[34:14.320 --> 34:19.480]  to decide the election. I just showed you that article. I had Obama saying, look, illegals
[34:19.480 --> 34:24.960]  go ahead and vote. You're not going to get in trouble because even if you're an illegal,
[34:24.960 --> 34:30.320]  voting makes you a citizen, which is what the reporter had just said to him. If you
[34:30.320 --> 34:36.400]  just joined us, it was the most astonishing video. This is the level of mind control that
[34:36.400 --> 34:42.520]  we've gotten to in this country. And then they say, why are you racist? Okay, racist,
[34:42.520 --> 34:49.600]  an illegal isn't a race. I mean, sure, they're predominantly from China now. China surpassed
[34:49.600 --> 34:54.080]  Mexico, but it's just people coming in and then they're just instantly allowed to vote.
[34:54.080 --> 35:01.840]  What the hell? But I can't go to their country and it's just like shut up racist. Meanwhile,
[35:01.840 --> 35:09.680]  Larry Nichols told us this. He said it last Sunday and he told me in several other interviews
[35:09.680 --> 35:13.560]  we did, he said they're going to come out Saturday or Sunday. They're going to distract
[35:13.560 --> 35:17.520]  away from WikiLeaks and all the bombshells, the fact that she was caught lying, the fact
[35:17.520 --> 35:21.160]  that she was caught in there saying, we got to cover this up. This is illegal. The paper
[35:21.160 --> 35:27.040]  play, the FBI's got a problem. They've got to prosecute her. Oh, there's no justice in
[35:27.040 --> 35:30.760]  this country. They're sending generals to jail as we speak that did one, one millionth.
[35:30.760 --> 35:34.800]  I mean, that did nothing. Hillary's got her made printing off her secret documents and
[35:34.800 --> 35:38.200]  doing stuff with them. She's, you know, Sandy Berger sneaking secret documents out in his
[35:38.200 --> 35:42.160]  underwear and not getting in trouble. They're busy shelling it to, you know, foreign countries.
[35:42.160 --> 35:48.640]  All that's okay because she's a woman. See, just like it's okay if you're a foreigner
[35:48.640 --> 35:52.600]  because anybody who's not American is good. As long as you're from somewhere else, have
[35:52.600 --> 35:56.480]  your baby free vote. You get to be a citizen. Now we can't go to your country and do that,
[35:56.480 --> 36:02.880]  but it's okay because this is American hospitality. American hospitality is like, you know, give
[36:02.880 --> 36:08.720]  them your wife, your kids, your house and just blow your brains out. Or Alec Baldwin will
[36:08.720 --> 36:15.080]  call you a racist. Well, I mean, who cares if that joke calls you something? These are
[36:15.080 --> 36:20.320]  traitors, folks. These are elites that are tax exempt, that are creating chaos and creating
[36:20.320 --> 36:24.280]  permanent underclasses and they're waging war against the American people. And Donald
[36:24.280 --> 36:30.840]  Trump 110% gets it and is saying, and that's why whether he wins or loses, he's won because
[36:30.840 --> 36:34.800]  he's brought forward how the operation really works, how we've been screwed over and what
[36:34.800 --> 36:41.120]  really has happened. The bigger question is how do we, the producers, start withdrawing
[36:41.120 --> 36:48.760]  from the system and just having a revolution of noncompliance because I'm ready to do it.
[36:48.760 --> 36:51.240]  The police aren't perfect, but they're more in the game, the general public, they're ready
[36:51.240 --> 36:59.000]  to do it. The military is ready to do it. It's truly a saddening time to see all of
[36:59.000 --> 37:06.040]  this unfolding. But Donald Trump, ladies and gentlemen, is set to win in a giant landslide.
[37:06.040 --> 37:12.560]  He is ahead two to 10 points now in every battleground state in mainline cheating polls,
[37:12.560 --> 37:21.200]  ABC, Reuters, Bloomberg, who all sample 9, 12, 16, 20, 30, 50 points. They are sampling
[37:21.200 --> 37:25.400]  in the average CNN poll. Look it up yourself. Click on the methodology of the poll. When
[37:25.400 --> 37:30.680]  you see the poll, click, there'll be five pages of crap. Read it. They are sampling
[37:30.680 --> 37:39.320]  in CNN polls on average 30 plus points for Hillary and Hillary now has a two point lead
[37:39.320 --> 37:44.960]  with 30 plus points added. CNN is the worst. I've seen them do on debate nights, 46 points
[37:44.960 --> 37:56.920]  more. Did you just hear me? 46% more Democrats than Republicans. And then she's only winning
[37:56.920 --> 38:04.400]  by 68%. That doesn't even make sense. She should almost be zero, except about 25% in that particular
[38:04.400 --> 38:09.680]  poll were independent. So that's how they were saying, you know, that they did, you
[38:09.680 --> 38:14.760]  know, this massively larger number for Democrats because there's such a small sampling rate,
[38:14.760 --> 38:20.440]  but 24% for Republicans. This is how they're doing it. They're totally ringing it. This
[38:20.440 --> 38:26.320]  country is in total revolution. Hillary has LeBron James come out NBA superstar and they
[38:26.320 --> 38:33.520]  had 300 to 400 people. Cleveland PD and I mean high level estimated the crowd of actual
[38:33.520 --> 38:37.520]  people that came in not mentioning Secret Service and her operatives that they numbered
[38:37.520 --> 38:44.840]  at 200. Well, I mean, the text is 300 inner crowd and another maybe 400 are on a rush,
[38:44.840 --> 38:48.200]  but they're estimating 300 people that came in that they had to basically one and check
[38:48.200 --> 38:53.880]  300 people. And the word is from the police. They were having to pay them. I've got it
[38:53.880 --> 38:58.240]  all right here. I'm not going to show you the whole text obviously for team of yours
[38:58.240 --> 39:03.120]  because it's a group text of different police officers and other folks involved. But I mean,
[39:03.120 --> 39:07.680]  you just show you this without the whole text history. This, this is the crowd as LeBron
[39:07.680 --> 39:14.800]  James spoke for TV viewers. Okay, a couple hundred here, people in the bleachers, maybe
[39:14.800 --> 39:22.160]  700, 300 that came in that weren't part of her operation. Let me just read you this without
[39:22.160 --> 39:30.880]  actually showing us. I don't show you these phone numbers. Let me read this to you. All
[39:30.880 --> 39:37.280]  right, stuff about communists that want to kill me, blah, blah, blah. There it is. At
[39:37.280 --> 39:42.600]  Hillary's rally, they said they're expecting 2K, barely 300 here. And that's with LeBron
[39:42.600 --> 39:50.840]  making an appearance pathetic. Let's see what the media say. LeBron is supposed to cancel.
[39:50.840 --> 39:58.080]  Her staff is on the street trying to beg people to come in from a friend. Hope all's well.
[39:58.080 --> 40:04.400]  Now later, 700 total. Most of them though are part of her honor. They're inviting all
[40:04.400 --> 40:15.520]  the drunks from the Browns game to come in. And then Comey just cleared Hillary again.
[40:15.520 --> 40:19.560]  They're telling all the black Browns fans to come and see LeBron speak, but they're refusing
[40:19.560 --> 40:31.080]  to. The whole crowd is basically white. Blacks and Cleveland hater. Oh my God. This is the
[40:31.080 --> 40:38.200]  type of stuff I'm getting. So much of it. I can't even keep track of it. What a country.
[40:38.200 --> 40:45.720]  What a world. What have we become? What have we become? And Larry Nichols insider managed
[40:45.720 --> 40:52.600]  to Clinton's random for the CIA. Nichols is not supposed to say that. I look, I'm killing,
[40:52.600 --> 40:56.360]  but that's what he did as a green beret. That's what they have as like handlers for people.
[40:56.360 --> 41:04.280]  And he said last week that the word is Alex. This is from a Supreme Court justice debt next
[41:04.280 --> 41:07.520]  Saturday or Sunday. They're going to clear the whole things over and it's meant to just
[41:07.520 --> 41:12.400]  take away from WikiLeaks. And boy was he dead on. Here's part of that clip is we got to break
[41:12.400 --> 41:17.160]  looking guns that we have right in front of us. Absolutely. Now they're trying to back
[41:17.160 --> 41:21.320]  us off of curtailing voter fraud or at least staying after it. They're trying to stop the
[41:21.320 --> 41:26.440]  media from they're trying to give the media an excuse to stay away from WikiLeaks. Now
[41:26.440 --> 41:32.960]  Comey was given an option. Apparently he was he had explained to him and the reason I know
[41:32.960 --> 41:37.680]  I believe this because I needed to people Alex when I was with him. Somebody went to him
[41:37.680 --> 41:44.560]  and said, you know, Jim, here's the deal, buddy. If Hillary loses your toast, your name
[41:44.560 --> 41:48.800]  is toast, your career is toast, you're done. And there's a good chance of an investigation
[41:48.800 --> 41:55.080]  that says you will be the one going to jail. Now, the best thing for you to do is to help
[41:55.080 --> 42:02.080]  us. He had no choice. So he participates in bringing out this, this, uh, this diverse
[42:02.080 --> 42:07.240]  emails, this diversion. Let me stop you six months ago, when the Loretta next thing happened,
[42:07.240 --> 42:10.200]  he was saying for a year, there will be no indictment. There will be no indictment.
[42:10.200 --> 42:15.320]  Clinton gave her a letter, a list of FBI people and prosecutors they got dirt on. And boy,
[42:15.320 --> 42:22.680]  you were proven right. So you say it again. What transpired? Yeah. Now the plan is, and
[42:22.680 --> 42:29.040]  you'll notice that even when they did this, the miraculous change took place. Number one,
[42:29.040 --> 42:34.640]  Mr. Good Guy James Comey, who's everybody said is Mr. Impeccable. The first thing he
[42:34.640 --> 42:40.480]  does is it breaks the 60 day rule. 60 day rule means back going back to. We're going
[42:40.480 --> 42:44.080]  to come back with more of this than Roger Stowe's straight ahead. But it's somewhere
[42:44.080 --> 42:48.880]  in this hour long interview. He says it'll be Saturday. It'll be Sunday. It'll be totally
[42:48.880 --> 42:58.120]  exonerated. And again, well, I'll tell you more when we come back.
[42:58.120 --> 43:04.040]  Defensory Clinton are erecting a demon. She's worked like a demon. As you know, it's Secretary
[43:04.040 --> 43:09.040]  of State. So Alex Jones is not the only one that thinks Hillary Clinton is a demon. And
[43:09.040 --> 43:15.720]  now we have Marina Abramovich emailing John and Tony Podesta talking about spirit dinners.
[43:15.720 --> 43:21.680]  Who is Marina Abramovich? A performance artist who focuses on pain, blood and physical limits
[43:21.680 --> 43:27.000]  of the body. Some of her performances have included communist stars, near death experiences,
[43:27.000 --> 43:32.000]  playing with skeletons, cutting her neck and sex. What is a spirit dinner? A ritual dinner
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.760]  where blood, semen and breast milk are painted on the wall. These are the type of things
[43:36.760 --> 43:42.760]  intellectuals like Lady Gaga are interested in. Marina Abramovich in New York. I was just
[43:42.760 --> 43:47.840]  speaking about her today. I am obsessed with this woman. So we have emails coming out of
[43:47.840 --> 43:52.680]  the Clinton camp now talking about say Tannock occult dinners. You're with her. This is Owen
[43:52.680 --> 44:02.680]  Troyer from info wars.com. Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things

[44:57.520 --> 45:02.160]  Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side. And as many of you
[45:02.160 --> 45:05.920]  know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the
[45:05.920 --> 45:10.960]  shocking statistics. Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000
[45:10.960 --> 45:15.440]  per man, woman and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and
[45:15.440 --> 45:19.520]  autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some
[45:19.520 --> 45:23.800]  kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[45:23.800 --> 45:26.920]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[45:26.920 --> 45:30.880]  your vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate
[45:30.880 --> 45:35.440]  nutritional raw materials into your day to day lives to guarantee that your body is getting
[45:35.440 --> 45:39.640]  the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats and amino acids

[46:42.880 --> 46:56.640]  That's infowarsteam.com.
[47:12.880 --> 47:39.760]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[47:39.760 --> 47:43.480]  By the way, we were sitting around talking about brainwashing earlier because that's
[47:43.480 --> 47:48.960]  how you can basically decipher what's happened to the public that actually buys into Hillary's
[47:48.960 --> 47:54.320]  bull and we were making the joke that everybody thinks that anybody that's a good public speaker
[47:54.320 --> 47:59.560]  must know neural linguistic programming, something I've never studied. And then these
[47:59.560 --> 48:05.520]  idiots online say, Alex Jones is involved in neural linguistic programming. Do you
[48:05.520 --> 48:10.160]  know who's involved in neural linguistic programming? I went and looked into it 10 years ago and
[48:10.160 --> 48:16.200]  I kept hearing when I was using it. I need a little news flash. Someone yelling, someone
[48:16.200 --> 48:21.240]  saying wake up, someone changing the pitch of their voice up and down. What's funny about
[48:21.240 --> 48:26.880]  it is I'm the opposite of neural linguistic programming. I'm trying to get you to get
[48:26.880 --> 48:31.440]  out of your thought pattern that you've been set in and to think for yourself. I'm here
[48:31.440 --> 48:37.760]  to raise your brainwaves. National public radio, though admittedly does train their
[48:37.760 --> 48:42.520]  top people in hypnotism and that's what they're doing.
[48:42.520 --> 48:50.640]  When you hear someone talking like this, that's one of the most basic forms. You ever heard
[48:50.640 --> 48:56.680]  those classical music stations where it almost sounds like the host is falling asleep and
[48:56.680 --> 49:04.400]  finishing the last word? That is the basic form of it and yes, it's going on. I don't
[49:04.400 --> 49:09.440]  sit here and craft what I'm doing. I just go with the facts and I'm here jumping around
[49:09.440 --> 49:14.160]  like a chicken with my head cut off trying to wake you up. But they were just showing
[49:14.160 --> 49:18.480]  me and there were people were saying I'm a neural linguistic programming master. In fact,
[49:18.480 --> 49:22.480]  I saw a bunch of mainstream news articles actually saying that last week like he's such
[49:22.480 --> 49:27.040]  a skilled speaker the way he manipulates people. He says he doesn't use a teleprompter but that's
[49:27.040 --> 49:31.920]  like this famous jazz guy saying he doesn't use music. He's the most manipulative person
[49:31.920 --> 49:38.240]  we've ever heard. We don't even know how he does it. He's so dangerous. I mean, you know,
[49:38.240 --> 49:44.040]  I'm dangerous. I got the Washington Post. I got Bloomberg. I've got the LA Times. I've
[49:44.040 --> 49:48.880]  got the Chicago Tribune all saying illegals are voting nationwide. It's very reasonable
[49:48.880 --> 49:53.480]  and I have Fox News local from LA and I have all these channels with the president going
[49:53.480 --> 49:59.280]  it's okay for illegals to vote and as long as you get here, you have a right to vote
[49:59.280 --> 50:04.880]  and people go it's riveting what to not lie to people to go look, they claim illegals
[50:04.880 --> 50:10.120]  aren't voting in this clip. Then the very same person saying it's preposterous is saying
[50:10.120 --> 50:17.400]  illegals can vote. What's riveting is I have an attention span and a memory and it's not
[50:17.400 --> 50:23.480]  even that good. I'm completely freaked out at this point. The fact that even the globalist
[50:23.480 --> 50:28.880]  top national writers who go to Gruber conferences and try to learn how to lie to people and
[50:28.880 --> 50:32.640]  deceive the crowd. Why don't you learn how to tell the truth for once? You might get
[50:32.640 --> 50:36.240]  ahead in life because let me say one of society has this level of corruption. Let me give
[50:36.240 --> 50:41.520]  you a big secret of evil since you seem to want to know about it. The knowledge of evil
[50:41.520 --> 50:46.280]  by the way is doesn't mean one is engaged in it. At the beginning of a very sovereign
[50:46.280 --> 50:51.080]  good honorable system, being evil is very dangerous because people will kill you or
[50:51.080 --> 50:56.320]  they'll ostracize you, they'll shun you. But in the mid levels of corruption when everybody
[50:56.320 --> 51:00.200]  starts to do it, there's still a lot of folks to feed on and a lot of dumb people and you
[51:00.200 --> 51:05.200]  can really get far ahead and there's lots of slots in being a piece of crap. And if
[51:05.200 --> 51:12.520]  you just want to have temporal power and more accumulation of crap and dominate dumb people,
[51:12.520 --> 51:17.520]  boy, that really makes you feel good. How about enlightening them with Promethean fire
[51:17.520 --> 51:24.280]  or Diet Ryan? You can get ahead. But in the final cycle, when the pendulum swinging into
[51:24.280 --> 51:30.080]  Hades, being a traitor is the plague. All the slots are filled. You're cheaper than
[51:30.080 --> 51:39.560]  dirt. No one wants you. You're going to be used as kindling. But now people go to college,
[51:39.560 --> 51:44.520]  they admit this, to learn how to lie and learn how to rip people off and learn how to work
[51:44.520 --> 51:49.720]  in the system. By the time, you know, you know when they say, and it's kind of an allegory,
[51:49.720 --> 51:57.360]  it's a story he told. It's not really true, but it's a famous story that they tell about
[51:57.360 --> 52:03.280]  Joe Kennedy Sr., big stock market guy. He was really just a money launder and boozerunner,
[52:03.280 --> 52:08.760]  big deal, whatever. And he said, oh, I sold out a month before the great crash of 29 because
[52:08.760 --> 52:13.560]  the shoeshine boy would tell me what stocks to buy. But there's something true to that.
[52:13.560 --> 52:17.360]  When you've got major colleges teaching how to rip the system off, teaching how to get
[52:17.360 --> 52:22.320]  all the free welfare payments, teaching how to be a little politico, you got in at the
[52:22.320 --> 52:27.400]  wrong time being a scumbag. See, now's the time if you were just a sociopath to be on
[52:27.400 --> 52:31.520]  the side of reform because that's what's coming. But you don't know that because you're too
[52:31.520 --> 52:38.160]  knuckle dragging and you like to be evil. Now, we did just get Roger Stone with us 20
[52:38.160 --> 52:42.600]  next hour. He's got a bunch of big news. Federal court just came out and said, no, he and Donald
[52:42.600 --> 52:47.800]  Trump were not voter intimidating doing classical exit polling. And that's, and poll watching
[52:47.800 --> 52:48.800]  what Trump's doing.
[52:48.800 --> 52:54.120]  But first Larry Nichols, halfway to this clip, he nailed it. He said literally several times,
[52:54.120 --> 52:59.000]  by next Saturday, Sunday, they will fully exonerate Hillary. This is the scam he was
[52:59.000 --> 53:04.840]  told by Supreme court justice. Here's more of the clip. Yeah. And the plan is, and you'll
[53:04.840 --> 53:12.120]  notice that even when they did this, the miraculous change took place. Number one, Mr. Good Guy
[53:12.120 --> 53:17.960]  James Comey, who's everybody says is Mr. Impeccable. The first thing he does is it breaks the 60
[53:17.960 --> 53:25.480]  day rule. 60 day rule means back going back to Irene Contra, you know, arms for hostages.
[53:25.480 --> 53:29.120]  After that election with Carter, the media and everybody in the ethics committee said,
[53:29.120 --> 53:32.920]  no longer can you bring something out 60 days before an election.
[53:32.920 --> 53:39.760]  He also leaked it. He didn't just tell Congress two weeks before. No, he got it. So he breaks
[53:39.760 --> 53:47.600]  that rule. And then here comes Hillary saying, get it all out. Get it all out. Now here's
[53:47.600 --> 53:51.440]  what they've got going for them. They've got the Republicans saying, get it all out. They've
[53:51.440 --> 53:56.080]  got Trump saying, get it all out. And of course you've got Hillary saying, get it all out
[53:56.080 --> 54:03.240]  with the intended purpose being the emails that Comey is going to release. Those emails
[54:03.240 --> 54:11.320]  have already been purged, Alex, and there's nothing in it to incriminate Hillary or Obama.
[54:11.320 --> 54:16.400]  Meanwhile, no one looks at the new WikiLeaks coming out daily or the total coup de gras
[54:16.400 --> 54:20.080]  that came out last week with Obama and Hillary saying, we got to clean this up and cover
[54:20.080 --> 54:21.080]  it up.
[54:21.080 --> 54:27.600]  And the campaign already has the press releases ready to go. And as far as I know, some of
[54:27.600 --> 54:32.680]  the mainstream media already have the papers already ready. The front page is ready to
[54:32.680 --> 54:39.640]  print saying that Hillary was innocent all along. This whole email thing was a Republican
[54:39.640 --> 54:48.320]  fraud set out to confuse the American people. It was never real. She walks away with the
[54:48.320 --> 54:56.440]  election. That's the plan. How the problem they're having Alex internally, the FBI guys
[54:56.440 --> 55:01.480]  have gained forces and let's go back down for Comey.
[55:01.480 --> 55:04.800]  Roger Stones with us a 20 something minutes in the next hour, former head of the Trump
[55:04.800 --> 55:11.560]  campaign of my intel, correct me if I'm wrong. Massive black Turner turnout record for Trump.
[55:11.560 --> 55:15.960]  Massive low turnout for Hillary. LeBron James has a rally for 300 people show up that were
[55:15.960 --> 55:19.600]  actual citizens. I have that from high level police department Cleveland showed the photos
[55:19.600 --> 55:25.520]  earlier. They have close in shots. He's ahead in most battleground states. There is massive
[55:25.520 --> 55:29.240]  election fraud happening though. And I've talked to high level sources. They're threatened
[55:29.240 --> 55:34.000]  in the military and everybody. You better stand down and shut up and we install Hillary.
[55:34.000 --> 55:38.120]  So a depressing moment on that front. But I tell you, I didn't know where the fat lady
[55:38.120 --> 55:41.960]  sings. We're going to challenge any evidence of fraud. So we got a lot to cover coming
[55:41.960 --> 55:44.840]  up here in the next hour. Roger Stone, where do you want to start?
[55:44.840 --> 55:50.360]  Oh, well, Alex, I'm delighted to be with you. It's nice to get off the telephone because
[55:50.360 --> 55:55.280]  I've been in an endless round of conference calls with lawyers. And I don't particularly
[55:55.280 --> 56:02.120]  like lawyers anyway. But the breaking news is that the ruling against Donald Trump, Roger
[56:02.120 --> 56:09.760]  Stone, Republican National Committee, the Trump campaign in StopTheSteel.org was overturned
[56:09.760 --> 56:17.520]  by the appeals court in Ohio late this afternoon. There is no evidence of any plan on our part
[56:17.520 --> 56:23.880]  to threaten or intimidate voters in any way. This follows on the heels of our victory in
[56:23.880 --> 56:32.600]  the Arizona federal court yesterday. Tomorrow we will have the adjudication of this lawsuit
[56:32.600 --> 56:42.480]  in Nevada, most likely Pennsylvania, Michigan, and North Carolina. I now believe that we
[56:42.480 --> 56:50.120]  will prevail everywhere because the facts are on our side. We merely seek to conduct
[56:50.120 --> 56:55.960]  a scientifically neutral exit poll. Which follows state department rules, which you've
[56:55.960 --> 56:59.640]  always done, of course, and that's on record. And I've seen the training you guys are engaged
[56:59.640 --> 57:03.920]  in. It is impeccably done better than what mainstream media does. The Democrats are running
[57:03.920 --> 57:08.080]  around electioneering inside the polling booths. We've caught video of it ourselves. It's
[57:08.080 --> 57:12.880]  pouring in. Evidence of fraud is pouring in. Clearly, do you agree with me? Donald Trump
[57:12.880 --> 57:17.320]  is in the lead right now. A, and then B, are they trying to steal it?
[57:17.320 --> 57:23.080]  I definitely think the momentum is with him. All of the swing states now he's moved into
[57:23.080 --> 57:30.040]  at least a toss-up category where he was slightly behind. Remember, it's all directional. It's
[57:30.040 --> 57:35.080]  not what the poll shows in terms of the actual number. It's who has the momentum and who
[57:35.080 --> 57:38.760]  is gaining and who has gained. And two days out, he's got momentum in the
[57:38.760 --> 57:43.840]  dead. He's what you're saying. Exactly. I don't know what to make of this
[57:43.840 --> 57:49.320]  recent... FBI, stay there. Back in 70 seconds. Stay with us for an hour.
[57:49.320 --> 57:53.800]  Secret 12. It's like lightning in a bottle. We all have days in which we just can't seem

[58:48.760 --> 58:54.120]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can
[58:54.120 --> 58:58.400]  produce. Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[58:58.400 --> 59:01.840]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[59:01.840 --> 59:07.240]  it's very, very important. What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates,
[59:07.240 --> 59:13.000]  we lose a little bit of our telomeres. Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.000]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[59:15.000 --> 59:20.800]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials. It's one of the most effective
[59:20.800 --> 59:26.160]  substances in the world. It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth
[59:26.160 --> 59:27.160]  factor.
[59:27.160 --> 59:31.000]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.
[59:31.000 --> 59:36.360]  We have so many five-star reviews. I take this. This is the product that I take.

[59:52.480 --> 01:00:02.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:09.800]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:21.320]  the mind of man, Thomas Jefferson. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:26.600]  By the way, I haven't even gotten into Hillary and the whole JZ Beyonce deal where they have
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.720]  her doing the simulated tear up the police cars, knockout windows, riot stuff. They're
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:36.880]  seeing about using cocaine, raping women. The N-word is screamed over and over again.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:43.800]  If Trump did something like this, some edited tape with him saying women throw themselves
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:47.120]  on you can do whatever you want. That's not sexual assault saying women throw themselves
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:52.760]  on you. But the point is, is I'm digressing. We have this coming up. There's so much cussing.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.880]  There's a beep every second basically. Hillary's at this clapping and then praising it while
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:04.920]  it happens. But then they have these things crying saying Donald Trump hurts our children
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:09.600]  when it was a secret tape. They're the ones putting it out. I mean, it is the death of
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.000]  common sense. That's coming up too. But Roger, this is a short segment, long segment coming
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.600]  up. You were getting into not knowing what to make of Comey. Well, the word is, is that
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.560]  they had to divert off of all the WikiLeaks and then make this look like she was being
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:27.000]  persecuted, making her the victim right at the end. It is a total November surprise brought
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.880]  to you by Comey, whose law firm and family work with the Clintons.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:38.120]  Yeah. Top here is it won't wash. As I understand it, he's referring to the 33,000 emails that
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:45.040]  were withheld. This does not address the 650,000 emails that have been discovered by the New
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:51.120]  York Police Department and are in their possession, as well as in the possession now of the FBI
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:57.000]  and presumably the Justice Department. My sources tell me there are indelible evidence
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:04.040]  of multiple crimes contained therein. And I know for a fact that one of the reasons
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:09.800]  why the FBI re-opened their investigation was because of an allegation that the nation
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:16.480]  of Serbia was shaken down for $2 million in order to get a meeting for their president
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:23.400]  with Barack Obama and that that money was siphoned and sent to the Clinton Foundation.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:29.640]  That is a crime. Mr. Comey is well aware of that allegation. So the notion that Hillary
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:38.560]  will will avoid prosecution is really challenges of believability. If there is, if Hillary
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:44.440]  should narrowly win this election and try to use the federal apparatus to shut down
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:50.000]  investigations of all the still evidence, you will have an insurrection in the country.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.280]  You'll have widespread civil disobedience. And you will have paralysis. She will be
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:02.640]  unable to govern. I just do not believe the American people will stand for it. And Roger,
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.600]  I totally agree. We've got to work in this record. Go ahead. I totally agree with you.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.960]  We've got to work in it. Let me give you the FBI's announcement just to understand what
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:15.360]  you're saying. You are correct. So let me just lay this out. The NYPD was going to
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.960]  press conference two weeks ago. I had this from sources. It's now been confirmed. Even
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.240]  you know, that's had a black waters come out and says his sources told him this, but this
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:28.920]  is that the NYPD has all these emails. It's full of underage sexting, pedophile connections,
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:36.120]  really horrible stuff. The the NYPD was about to go public. It forced the FBI to move because
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.320]  the FBI ranking file wanted it, but also Comey had to make it look like he was going to do
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:46.440]  something. But they now claim the whole 650,000 emails here at his daily mail also associated
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:53.040]  with the press. Comey claims they went through it all in just nine days, all 650,000 and
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.880]  he's saying all of it's open and shut now. So this is an attempt to put everything to
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:02.720]  bed. But now we'll see what the NYPD does. Yeah, I would think that having they've they've
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.840]  also read these emails and they have said that there is evidence of crime. Alex put aside
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:17.480]  the sex allegations, please, treason, corruption, pay for play. These are more egregious. I'm
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:21.560]  not sure what to make of them. And by the way, they're all confirmed in WikiLeaks already.
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:27.160]  No one's getting in trouble. Right. So they're not going to be able to sweep this under the
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:33.560]  carpet. This is a nice try. But when or lose Hillary Clinton's heading to the big house
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:37.360]  one way or another, given the form we come back then, I'm going to flesh all this out.
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.400]  I totally agree with you. These are epic crimes never before seen this public. I mean, stuff
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:46.680]  model stuff like this may have happened before, but it's never been this out in the open.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:51.080]  It's a nice try at sweeping it under. It's not going to work. Where does this go next?
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:54.840]  The good news is law enforcement itself is really awake, really upset. The public's waking
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:59.080]  up as well. Roger Stone is our guest stay with us.

[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:39.560]  media is being covertly manipulated by well financed political forces who are trying to
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:44.320]  sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment agendas. But

[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:25.920]  From Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones, whether he wins or loses
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:31.480]  this election, no matter what comes out of it is a total winner. He had courage. You've
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:36.640]  had courage. You've taken action. Globalism is on the table as a crony capitalist anti
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:41.200]  free market mafia system. The fact that the Federal Reserve is screwing us over is huge.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:47.480]  The fact that our borders are being resolved. Political correctness is in tatters. Humanities
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:52.560]  on the March. It took Brexit 25 years with UKIP in the last two years with Donald Trump.
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:56.160]  We have eclipsed that. Now I believe he's ahead in the battleground states. The evidence
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.200]  shows and I believe there's going to be a landslide. But Hillary is trying to steal it.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:04.560]  Roger Stone's been victorious with Trump in their exit polling and poll watching. Trump
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:09.800]  doing poll watching exit polling with with stone very professionally done following state
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:14.480]  laws doing exit polls. We go out and do exit polls as media. And they're fine as long as
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.880]  they think we're Democrats when they find out we're patriots they flip out and say you
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:22.480]  just can't be here period. Okay, you know, we know you're here for Trump to disrupt.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:28.760]  This is happening on video. But the big news Roger Stone recap to some stations don't carry
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:37.040]  that first little segment of the hour. Recap the FBI has come out. Our Clinton insider said
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.880]  they're going to come out Saturday or Sunday. He said this last Sunday Larry Nichols. We
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:43.880]  played it last hour and they're going to announce that she's totally exonerated and everything.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:48.800]  So if we had diverged from WikiLeaks for seven, eight days, Trump takes the bait and Nichols
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:55.240]  said please don't take it covers the 650,000. Comey comes out and says she's totally exonerated.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:59.600]  But he had to because the NYPD was gonna have a press conference we've now confirmed two
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:06.240]  weeks ago and expose the the horrible stuff, the trees and the treachery, the paper play
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:12.520]  that was in this as well. And so they had to basically have a time out to stall people
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:16.720]  until we were 48 hours or less out from the election. Now they've done it trying to take
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:20.520]  her weakness and make it a strength like oh look she's been exonerated. But as you just
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:26.120]  said, nice try at sweeping us under the rug. Not gonna work. Drain the swamp. I think it's
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.520]  going into hyperspace. Roger Stone. Yeah, I think the FBI director has worn out his
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.920]  credibility. He's now changed his position three times. It's very clear that he is acting
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:42.960]  politically. And there are career agents there who are not going to stand for this.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:49.760]  And you have the independence of the NYPD. And I think they've made it very clear that
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:54.960]  and if there's any effort to sweep this under the carpet or to say that oh we reviewed the
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:00.120]  emails and there were no evidence of illegality that they'll release them all and then let
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.960]  the people decide what we have. Now the truth is prior to any of this happening, Comey had
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:10.400]  more than enough to indict Hillary. David Petraeus was indicted for less. Others have
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:16.720]  been indicted for less. The American people will get justice. I cannot see any circumstance
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:22.080]  even if she were to win this election in which she will be able to govern or actually even
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:32.040]  able to appear in public without a massive civil disobedience and uprising by the people.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:36.720]  We either are a nation of laws or we are not. And that is what we're going to find out here
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:43.280]  shortly. Meanwhile, Trump I think is soaring towards an upset victory here which will negate
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:51.440]  all of this. I presume that in the period between the election and the inauguration Obama will
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:57.200]  probably pardon everybody who's been involved in this sordid mess.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.000]  That would be the safest move for the establishment but they seem so arrogant these days. They
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.160]  don't have the class they have with Nixon. It seems like they might just try it.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:12.960]  Very possible. But I don't think anyone should assume that any of these issues or the
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:18.600]  dynamic that we're in goes away. There will be no honeymoon regardless of who is elected
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:26.880]  president. There will be no cessation of tensions. This fight inside the country about what we
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:32.880]  want to be and whether we are a nation of laws or a nation of men is going to continue.
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:38.160]  That's right. Trump has just been the master of ceremonies basically here. And you and
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:42.800]  I and others and Drudge have been ring leaders here at the circus trying to get folks awake
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:49.600]  and it's happened now. The worldwide awakening to globalism is only accelerating and so that's
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:54.360]  the good news here is that we have come here to kick ass and chew bubble gum and we're
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:58.360]  all out of bubble gum and I mean it was in the Wall Street Journal and Associated Press
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:05.880]  as you know on Monday that major newspapers revenue is down 97.5% in the last quarter.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:13.440]  That is a heart attack with the heart completely dead. So the entire mainstream media is in
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:18.680]  free fall. We are all exploding with rocket engines so huge. The only danger is we might
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:27.000]  blow up in our ascension. I mean sir, I'm not exaggerating. We now on average are having
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.200]  10 to 15 million video views a day. We did a live show last night. It had three million
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:37.920]  viewers. Just an internet show with no promotion. You're putting out videos getting 20 million
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:43.320]  views a week. There's kids in farmhouses talking trash about Obama getting 68 million views
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:48.120]  a week. What the hell are they going to do? CNN doesn't get 68 million viewers in a freaking
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:54.000]  month. That's why they're so desperate to get control of the internet. It's why they
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.160]  are so desperate to quote unquote regulate that means shut down the internet because
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:04.280]  it has afforded us an avenue to communicate with each other that they never anticipated.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:09.840]  In other words, the establishment, the media government establishment no longer has a monopoly
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:15.320]  on mass communications in this country and therefore it is the beginning of the end for
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:21.680]  the globalists and the two-party duopoly that have run this country into the ditch. Meanwhile,
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:27.000]  just came across my computer, Daniel Williams is trying to reach Jay-Z. Wants to ask him
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.280]  whether black lives matter or not. Wants to ask him about whether he's familiar with the
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:37.360]  1994 crime bill which has incarcerated an entire generation of young black men for the
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:43.640]  nonviolent crime of possession of small amounts of drugs. Maybe Jay-Z is unaware of Hillary's
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.680]  record of abuse of black people.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:51.040]  Well, let's talk about that since you raised it. I've seen the numbers correct when I'm
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.720]  wrong because you're the guy that really is in there looking at them. Record low turnout
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:59.200]  by African Americans for Hillary, very high turnout for Trump.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:05.240]  It appears that looking at the early DASA in the state court there has been early voting
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:11.520]  that African American turnout has been substantially down from where it was four years ago and
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:17.560]  eight years ago. Now that is of course partially understandable given the fact that Barack
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:26.360]  Obama is not on the national ticket. But at the same time, this is a key element of victory
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:31.680]  for Hillary Clinton. It's something she will have to have in order to get there. I believe
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:39.800]  the examination of the 94 crime bill and the entire public exposure of Daniel Williams,
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:45.760]  whose story I find extraordinarily credible, has undermined the voter confidence among
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:48.040]  African Americans for Hillary Clinton.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:56.160]  Let's talk the scare last night briefly out in Nevada. Now we know it's a Democratic Party
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.320]  operative that was there to bird dog. What is the point of screaming gun, gun, and then
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.440]  running at Trump? Is it to make him look weak or something?
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:10.200]  Well, what I found particularly aggravating, Alex, and I was on with Joe Biggs last night
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:16.640]  on InfoWars to talk about this, is within seconds of this happening, we counted over
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:25.160]  400 tweets blaming me. Roger Stone staged this to gain sympathy for Donald Trump. This
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.000]  is some serious in Wonderland stuff.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  And it shows how rigged it is. It shows how rigged. Now they admit it's a Democratic Party
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.560]  bird dogger that WikiLeaks has covered. So why are they so scared of you? God, they're
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:42.040]  obsessed with you, buddy. Yeah, well, speak for yourself. They seem to have you in their
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:49.000]  sights as well. Very hard to understand, but clearly the fact that this happened so quickly
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.200]  sheds the point of looking back on them. Back on David Brocking company. Well, it's
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:59.160]  on drugs. He's a Democratic blogger, a bird dogger. I mean, it's, it's, it's, they've
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.680]  got the guy.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:07.320]  So really not staged by us, but it, you know, it does make my heart jump because as I've
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:12.720]  told you many times, my single greatest concern has been for Donald's safety.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.960]  What do they want to have him fall down or look scared or have Secret Service jump on
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:18.920]  him? Because instead he was just sitting there staring on the Secret Service and it takes
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:22.520]  him out. He looks graceful as he leaves, comes right back. I don't think it turned
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:23.520]  into what they wanted.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:28.000]  They just don't understand Donald Trump. Alex, he is the single toughest human being I have
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.520]  ever met. This guy is the right man to send the negotiations with the Russians, with the
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:39.160]  Chinese, with our adversaries. He has ice water in his veins when it comes to toughness
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.760]  and standing up to the country. And he's not, he's not a physical coward, like say, Lyndon
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:49.920]  Johnson. And he knows he's taking his life and he has a very fatalistic view about it.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.560]  He's going to save this country.
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:55.240]  Come on, it's time for inside baseball. Let's come back and talk about that briefly. You
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:58.240]  got to go. Then we got Larry Nichols. Come on on.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:03.800]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America? Because of what we did on this day, change
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:04.800]  has come to America.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.840]  Something's wrong and we all know it. I'm Charity Daniels and I'm here to tell you
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:10.840]  about it.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:15.640]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:22.680]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie. God
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:30.760]  was in school. Morality had a future. And beef was for supper. Revelation, dawn of global
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:31.760]  government.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.400]  We're the solution. Americans, ain't nothing more to it than that.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:41.160]  Starring Alex Jones, Charity Daniels, and Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin, theatrical
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:47.880]  screenings on demand, DVDs now available on a shed of tears over the red, white and blue.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:56.360]  Revelation, the movie.info. Americans need to see this film. Revelation, the movie.info.
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.360]  Let's fix it.

[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:04.680]  it's completely different. Try a bottle of it. Rob Doe joins us. You worked, I guess,
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:08.560]  like 20-plus hours. Tell us what Brainforce did. I've been working all day. I took a
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:14.240]  couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down. You
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.960]  know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it. And I really wanted to do a good
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:21.240]  job on the interview. I got my bottle of Brainforce right there. I popped two of them. And about
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:25.600]  20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind of clears up. It's got four and
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.720]  a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third-party nutraceutical

[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:39.880]  that will blow your socks off. I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:44.440]  probably could not have done it without Brainforce. I went home about 6.45 this morning, took
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:49.520]  three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brainforce and came in. You will find Brainforce
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:20:06.800]  and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139. You're listening to the
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:20.760]  album.
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:30.680]  He aligns himself with the truth. And it's time for you to choose a side. You are listening
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.120]  to Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:38.160]  I'm totally public about my life and what I stand for, but when you're where a journalist
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:43.440]  had and have sources, it's all about people having confidence in you that you won't release
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:48.840]  info on them, no matter it be positive or negative, unless they want it released.
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.760]  And boy, I tell you, I've been burned a lot because of that.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.920]  You know, John Ronson said, I'm a sneaky and bohemian grove with me.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:54.920]  I've got insiders.
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.040]  You can't tell people I went in with you.
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.040]  You've got a promise.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.040]  And I said, absolutely.
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.040]  And two years later, he went on C-Span.
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:05.440]  He said, Alex Jones didn't tell you, I snuck in with him, did he, and he actually used
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.920]  that to burn me.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:11.960]  So you think about that.
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:16.240]  So but, but the point is, I got a lot of stuff, obviously with the Trump stuff I could talk
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.240]  about and be in all the papers.
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.240]  I don't care about being in all the papers.
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.240]  Doesn't do anything.
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.240]  I want to talk to real people.
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.240]  Folks that care.
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.240]  That's who I want to talk to.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.240]  You.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.240]  You're wonderful.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:26.400]  I'm like in Mel Gibson's new movie.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:27.400]  I'm told.
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:28.400]  Everybody's told me.
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.000]  I was told a couple of years ago, but I haven't gone to see it.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  I don't care.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  I'm in a Mel Gibson movie.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.200]  The point is, is that you're like drives around with me on the radio and like agrees
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.200]  with it or something.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:38.200]  I don't care.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.200]  And I'm not bragging.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.800]  They asked me to be in movies and I just don't even, you know, do it.
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:45.240]  Stone's got to leave in a minute, but I wanted him to get to this because, you know, he's
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:49.200]  told me stuff that I later saw come out or other people told me.
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:52.400]  And the fact was a couple of years ago, Trump wasn't going to run.
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:56.520]  He knew what would happen to him, but he just finally said, okay, I'll just sign my life
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:00.840]  over and it doesn't matter and his wife backed him on and he expects to probably be killed.
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.200]  And Stone just let it slip.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:06.800]  So I brought it up of how committed Trump is.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:07.800]  And it's amazing.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.960]  You said he's fatalistic about this.
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:12.320]  Let's tell people what, what, what Trump's done.
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:18.080]  Well, first of all, just the number of states that he's reaching here, Alex, in the next,
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:22.760]  you know, 24 hours, this is a Herculean physical effort.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.880]  I worked for Reagan.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:24.880]  I worked for Nixon.
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.600]  I worked for Bob Dole, all patriots.
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:27.600]  It's Herculean.
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:35.120]  None of them, you know, exerted this kind of physical effort in the clothes.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:41.760]  Trump is the Superman and he is the race moving his way, not only in the swing states, but
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:42.760]  in some.
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:43.760]  No, but you said it.
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:45.440]  Let's talk about, you said fatalistic.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:48.760]  Let's get down to the wire that they can't even make him wear a bulletproof vest.
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:50.280]  He just doesn't even care.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.280]  This is so presidential.
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:57.720]  Well, he wore one in the summertime, and frankly, was so damn hot and heavy that he felt it
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:01.360]  was slowing down his performance on the stump.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:04.480]  His family has begged him to take more security precautions.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.520]  Let's not let out security sabers.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.520]  That's an example.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.680]  He just doesn't care, folks.
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:09.840]  That is so manly.
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:10.840]  You called him fatalistic.
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.760]  Go ahead and tell folks, since you mentioned it.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:16.520]  But in other words, I've said to him, aren't you worried about your physical safety?
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:18.840]  And he says, look, I have to do this.
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:23.360]  For the country, you can't run for president and not mix with the people.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:26.200]  He is the opposite of that coward demon, Hillary, isn't he?
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:29.440]  Well, I mean, I don't think she's well enough to go in public.
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:35.000]  I think she's got to rest up in between campaign appearances because of her various ailments.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.840]  Well, you've got to come back tomorrow.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:38.440]  And again, this will be perfect.
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:41.440]  What do we do if they steal it, which is close evidence they're trying?
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:48.360]  Well, I'm going to be in Austin, so we'll have plenty of time to plan exactly that.
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:53.960]  But I think it's important to game plan election day before you game plan what you're going
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:54.960]  to do the day.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.720]  And by the way, I agree with you.
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.720]  But I'm very honored.
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:58.720]  I guess you left that out of the bag.
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:23:59.720]  That's good.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:03.160]  You're going to be here at the command base with us here in the 52 hour global transmission
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.560]  that kicks off tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.600]  I'm very, very excited about it.
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:08.800]  So look forward to seeing you.
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.120]  Well, you'll have the run of the place.
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:12.680]  Roger Stone, you're a great American, such a truthful patriot.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:15.880]  It's why they call him a liar and dirty trickster because that's the inverse.
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:18.680]  The secret is he tells the truth and knows what he's doing.
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:19.680]  Stone cold truth.com.
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:22.680]  I know you got to go because you got like ABC news there.
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:24.680]  Any other points that need to be made?
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:29.200]  You know, like how we say, victory or death, see you tomorrow.
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:31.320]  All right, there he goes.
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:39.000]  I wish I could tell you the stuff I know, folks, it's unbelievable.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  I'm not going to give it.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.800]  I mean, it's just crazy the stuff they've done to Trump that nobody even knows about.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:43.800]  It's wild.
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.360]  And he just doesn't even care.
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:48.880]  He's like, he is so committed, you can tell he's just enjoying it.
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:53.920]  That's what a real man does under attack, just turns it into a big game.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:58.240]  That's why he's like, if America wants freedom and wants to tax his cut and wants to be back
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:01.120]  on the path to be a number one, I'm here.
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.480]  I love this country.
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:07.520]  And if you don't want it, you want that witch Hillary, then it's yours.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.760]  But he knows he's winning and he didn't let her steal it.
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:17.840]  He's going to fight back and speak out.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:21.680]  And down to the wire, folks, I can tell you high level groups have come to Trump and they
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:26.720]  know he's ahead and they've said, just work with us and we will let you win.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:29.760]  He said, I serve the American people.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:33.160]  This happened yesterday.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:34.800]  I can't believe the level I met in this, folks.
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:37.560]  If you knew how real this was, you would be crapping your pants.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:44.200]  They came to Trump and they said the deep state, the older elements of it, Bush connected
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:45.200]  groups.
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:52.560]  And they said, just say you'll work with us and just say you'll listen to us some and
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:55.080]  we will let you win.
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:56.720]  You are the winner.
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:01.720]  And Donald Trump told him, no.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:09.280]  The American people are going to decide and they said, okay, buddy, okay.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:12.120]  And that was a warning last night.
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:15.440]  God jumping up with a gun, I got a gun, I got a gun, we're running at the podium.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.440]  What Trump did?
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:22.480]  He just stood there and waited because Trump wants to beat these people bad, folks.
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:25.880]  When you're 17, you got it all and you're not into molesting kids.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.520]  Most people that get into this power, I guess they just start molesting kids like, oh, what's
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.520]  new?
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:30.520]  I'll just molest kids.
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:35.840]  So a lot of people that are good, they actually decided to fight for freedom and thought they've
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:36.840]  lied about it.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:39.440]  And, you know, I have a kinship with Trump because I've experienced the lies and the
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:44.680]  twisting where you get up and they're like, Alex Jones is deeply racist and hates Mexicans.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:45.680]  No proof.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:46.960]  Alex Jones hates black people.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:50.720]  What the hell are you talking about?
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:54.360]  And Hillary's calling me this dark heart.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.920]  Trey Gowdy on the committee, Oberman Gazi said it best.
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:58.920]  She's above the law.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.480]  They've corrupted the top of the government.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:04.840]  All you can do is vote her out with a landslide and let me tell you, Hillary and Bill and
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:13.720]  Obama are actually really skittish right now because they know it's hard to beat a landslide.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.040]  I'm going to bed at like midnight.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.040]  I'm getting up about 3 a.m.
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:17.040]  I can't even sleep.
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:18.040]  I've never had any.
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:19.040]  I've got to sleep seven hours.
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:20.040]  Great.
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.280]  I can't sleep right now.
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.440]  And I'm just very proud to be associated with Donald Trump and all of you listeners and
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:29.400]  good people of every color and wherever you came from, I love you, if you love liberty,
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:33.040]  you see through this, you want justice, it is really good knowing you.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:34.040]  Let's play part of the clip.
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:35.040]  I want to get to it all.
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.840]  But here's part of Gowdy.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:39.360]  What part of this decision do you agree with?
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:42.000]  No, I don't agree with any part of it.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.360]  I understand it.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.320]  That's the curse of being a lawyer is that you are able to understand the other side's
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:48.320]  argument.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.480]  I just vigorously disagree with it.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:57.360]  His argument is he thinks there's a specific intent element in a gross negligent statute.
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.840]  So it's not that I'm confused about it.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:02.040]  I just fundamentally disagree with it.
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.040]  Okay.
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:08.520]  Now he said that there were classified emails on Cheryl Mills' computer, the aide to Secretary
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:09.520]  Clinton.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:16.880]  But then he would not say whether or not that was a crime unless he looked at the case more
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:17.880]  in depth.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:21.240]  How do you look at the case when you give someone immunity?
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:28.160]  It just, it doesn't square the key parts at the end where he says, look, they're above
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:29.160]  the law.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:30.160]  You just got to vote her out.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:31.480]  But here's the good news.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.480]  People now know the score.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.440]  Whether they steal it from Trump or not, we're gaining momentum.
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:36.440]  We're fighting back.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:37.440]  This is his victory.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:45.120]  Laying down his apathy, disintegration, atrophy and death.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:49.200]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:52.160]  This is the info war, infowars.com.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.160]  Spread that link.
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:58.000]  That's the big part of the revolution right there.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.960]  In case you haven't realized it yet, Hillary Clinton takes money from the same people who
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.840]  fund radical Islamic terror.
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:04.840]  That's right.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:09.840]  The same people that fund ISIS, yes, that ISIS that beheads and rapes people in the streets.
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:14.240]  That ISIS who declares the West its enemy, yes, Hillary Clinton is funded by the same
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:15.820]  people who fund ISIS.
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:20.080]  Just take a look at the foreign donors to the Clinton Foundation in Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:22.800]  These same people are funding radical Islamic terror.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:26.960]  If you wish to believe that Hillary was too stupid to realize this, you'd be wrong.
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:32.160]  There's an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, so not so long after she left Secretary of
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:40.760]  State to her campaign manager, John Podesta, it states that ISIL, ISIS, is funded by Saudi
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:45.720]  Arabia and Qatar, the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:50.680]  So essentially, you could make the case that ISIS and Hillary Clinton take orders from
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:52.040]  the same people.
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:53.040]  You're with her.
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:59.040]  This is Owen Troyer for infowars.com.
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:02.120]  Not a group you develop living defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:03.840]  Why is this so good?
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:08.360]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:13.120]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.120]  my system.
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:19.360]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:22.160]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:27.240]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.520]  going on everywhere.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:29.520]  These are all parasites.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:32.200]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:36.560]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:39.840]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:42.880]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:46.040]  It just came back in yesterday, living defense, infowarslife.com.
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.040]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.880]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:53.160]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.

[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.240]  I'm Alex Jones with a simple question.
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:04.560]  Will you and your family be financially protected if there's another economic meltdown?
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:07.960]  Like many experts, I believe another devastating crash is coming.
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:10.280]  I think it's a matter of when, not if.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:13.000]  Don't wait for another crisis that could wipe out your hard-earned money.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:18.560]  Do what I did and call United States Gold Vault at 844-541-ALAX.
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:19.960]  It's a company I trust.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:24.600]  They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs that could help safeguard your money
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:25.840]  in an economic meltdown.
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:29.440]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:32.640]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:33.920]  on the move.
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:38.720]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:39.720]  finances.
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:40.720]  Don't delay.
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:46.600]  Call 844-541-ALAX now and get a rugged double-locked bank bag to securely store your coins.
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:47.600]  Absolutely free.
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:51.880]  These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:54.680]  I personally own these survival packs and you should too.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:33:02.440]  Check up the phone and call 844-541-ALAX now.
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:15.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:20.680]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:27.680]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:37.000]  Well, my friends, I've pretty much always, the last 15 years or so, shot a daily or two
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.720]  video for YouTube on top of the radio show and, you know, I used to be happy when the
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:45.920]  video got 50,000 views and I thought 100,000 was great, 200,000 or 300,000.
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:49.360]  The average video is getting about a million views right now.
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:54.440]  That's a metric of how upset and awake people are and it's only getting more intense and
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.640]  we're just one platform in this fight.
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:02.120]  So as negative as some of this information is, it's overall very positive so that we
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:04.680]  can have an open discussion about what's happening.
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:08.320]  A lot of these new age groups and folks, they just want to hear a bunch of positive stuff
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:12.480]  and say, you know, mystical thinking is going to fix things and I'm not bashing those people,
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.400]  but admitting how much trouble we're in, that's what's going to turn things around and make
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:18.520]  things better.
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:21.640]  Not just going along with anything.
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:25.880]  So I don't cover all this to take your hope, I cover it to give you hope to know the warm
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:26.880]  is turning.
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:31.240]  Now Larry Nichols battling cancer, just back from the hospital today, I really appreciate
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:36.040]  him joining us, I'm so busy, I hardly comb my hair even though this is a slash TV show
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:37.040]  as well.
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:41.040]  I end up, people are like, I don't wear makeup on TV or anything, I forget to even comb my
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:46.080]  hair and it's ridiculous, you're combing it on TV.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.520]  There's just so much to get to here.
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:53.440]  We're going to be talking to him in a moment, but I want to talk in the next segment, probably
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:57.080]  have him up for a full hour later this week, in fact he is coming on during the 52 hour
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:01.960]  broadcast, it starts tomorrow at 11 a.m., runs through election day on the next day.
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:05.240]  About the occult and the Clintons, he's the first guy I've ever heard about the Clintons
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:10.640]  involved in the occult, since then I found an article in Washington Post, other articles,
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:14.400]  Bill Clinton wrote a book about it, his early years, admitted he went to a voodoo school
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:18.880]  in Haiti, they had their honeymoon there, he likes the spirits possessing him, I mean
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:24.760]  I showed all this yesterday on that special broadcast, I can't even believe it.
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:28.480]  And then I'm not saying with all this new WikiLeaks that all this stuff's code words,
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:32.040]  that's what the NYPD is saying, I don't know if this is innocuous, most of you people are
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:37.520]  probably innocent in these thousands of emails with Podesta, but the police are saying look
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:44.240]  at this and the investigation got open because of sex texting and then the Lolita Express
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:49.240]  and then Breitbart's got articles and the FBI's come out saying yeah, we're looking at Hillary
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:54.280]  being on the Epstein plane, he got convicted, I mean this guy was running little kids.
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:56.920]  So we're going to talk about that in the next segment, this is a short segment I want to
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:00.800]  get into his prediction coming through, we already played it in the first hour, but Larry
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:05.640]  Nichols came on three times last week with us and we put out several reports, he advised
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:10.000]  me on Saturday after the FBI report came out last Saturday, I said one of my insiders said
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.360]  it'll come out next Saturday or next Sunday, that she's totally absolved, this way they
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:18.080]  could block everybody from looking at WikiLeaks because they know the public's barely paying
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:19.080]  attention.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:23.440]  Then it would be a big win for her to say see it was all clean and Nichols helped train
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:27.160]  these people, that's why he's dead on, we'll talk to him in a moment, but before we go
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:32.960]  any further, here is Comey headed up the Benghazi committee saying your activism is now is to
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:39.280]  vote against Hillary and then we'll go to Larry Nichols, do we have Comey ready?
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:47.480]  This is what your viewers have to come to, no one who sent classified information was
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:54.000]  prosecuted, no one who received classified information was prosecuted, no one who destroyed
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:00.080]  federal records was prosecuted, out of all of this five immunity agreements and a really
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:07.200]  unusual investigation about national security matters with hundreds of classified emails,
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:12.200]  now one single person is going to face a legal consequence.
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:16.720]  That means this case is dead in the water, right?
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:21.920]  It is dead in the water other than what I have said in the past, there are multiple groups
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:26.400]  in our culture who provide oversight, there's the executive branch, there's Congress, there's
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:32.240]  you in the media, but on November the 8th, the real jury gets to weigh in and if they
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:37.440]  think that this Department of Justice has been politicized, they are welcome to replace
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.280]  it with another Department of Justice.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:43.200]  And that's Trey Gowdy, in the one where you couldn't find the clip, you're like, what
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:48.760]  Comey, on what Comey's decision, so that's the head of the House Oversight Committee,
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:54.240]  so he predicted, he said there will be no indictment with Loretta Lynch and he described
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:58.000]  what happened on the plan with Bill Clinton and Herb, he said that this is all red herring
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.200]  a week ago, we got an attack for that, so he's been proven correct.
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:07.840]  Larry Nichols, the former Clinton handler, is here to break it down, so Larry, what
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:08.840]  does this signify?
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:16.440]  Well, first off, it's nothing to be proud of me and mine, what it signifies, I'm just
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:22.400]  taking the rest of it, the plan was to come out, prove that it was all nothing, and she
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:27.160]  will have this big rally talking about, you know, having the mean old Republicans, usually
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.840]  just a Republican plot.
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:29.840]  That'll be tomorrow.
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:35.720]  And then the thing that they've all got to do, all major media, have got to turn in
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:43.520]  and submit to the Clintons, to their campaign, their Wednesday morning headlines about her
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:47.040]  victory or approval.
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:52.160]  So this gives her control of tomorrow, having to have all her campaign on to crow about
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:55.840]  how they did never do anything, even though all the WikiLeaks show them, hiding all the
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:02.400]  crimes, expunging evidence, selling paper play, espionage, all of it is black holes.
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.680]  All of it.
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:10.960]  And then the reason they want the headlines on Wednesday to be approved by the campaign
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:17.320]  is to give them the launching pad they need to quote-unquote have the mandate she demands,
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:23.600]  but more than that, to quell any potential resistance from people claiming foul over
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:28.040]  voter fraud and to stop Trump from having any reports.
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:31.000]  Because she's already been proven of being wronged, and they've already got the talking
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:36.600]  point that we talked about two weeks ago with other insiders on air and off air, that
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:38.600]  see, she was persecuted.
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:42.120]  She's got to shut down the alt-right, plus the Republicans want to work with her, because
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:44.120]  that's the group that discredited them.
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:45.120]  That's the narrative.
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:46.120]  Yeah.
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:52.880]  And she's going to do one dang job after this election, making sure the Republicans
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.720]  hold their fire from now on.
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:58.920]  You've got to remember, Alex, if you were a Republican, let's say Craig Gowdy or any
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:03.920]  of them, after this election, Congress could have a hearing.
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:04.920]  They could have a hearing.
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:09.240]  They could pursue all of this stuff, but the best Congress can do, and they know it, and
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:15.360]  she knows it, Alex, the best they can do is recommend, especially prosecutor, be appointed.
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.360]  And you just heard Gowdy say it was over.
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.360]  That was a big deal.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:19.360]  Yeah.
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:23.040]  Now, when that happens, guess where it has to go?
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:27.040]  It has to go to the Justice Department to proceed.
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:33.480]  Then, let's just be honest, after the election, Trump complains about voter fraud, even if
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:35.880]  he has great amounts of proof.
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:38.240]  He's got to go to Loretta Lynch.
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:40.840]  Where's it got to be filed?
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:41.840]  Federal court.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.840]  You know what happens in federal court?
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:47.040]  I mean, they've got this thing rigged every way that's done that.
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.400]  And this is the final Democratic Party takeover.
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.280]  It's why Beck and the Republicans know it.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:55.240]  They're just wanting to get final payoffs as we go to one party state, as WikiLeaks has
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:56.240]  said.
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:58.440]  They put five more folks on the Supreme Court.
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:40:59.600]  They take our guns.
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.240]  They open the borders.
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:02.240]  America's conquered.
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:03.240]  End of the story.
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:04.240]  End of the story.
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:08.640]  Now, let me say this, Alex, remember what I've been telling you and your audience about
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:13.240]  over a year now, but they'll be, too, the silent clue, too.
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.240]  You're seeing it.
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:17.120]  This election is the end of it.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:18.960]  This is the end of America, of course.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:19.960]  That's right.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:25.440]  This is when the Hillary and her minions believe that they have accomplished the task and are
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:30.360]  ready to set forth with complete and total transformation of our former government and
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:31.360]  our way of life.
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:35.760]  They will pursue it aggressively, aggressively.
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:39.240]  They're coming after the better clingers.
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:41.000]  They're coming after the veterans.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.600]  They're coming after, well, you know what that means, Larry.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:47.320]  You've tried to fix all this peacefully, and we're not offensive, but I guess they're
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:48.800]  just making it real clear.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:55.280]  Well, I've actually been privileged to get some information from the people that told
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.360]  me what they were going to do with this FBI thing.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:00.720]  These are the same people they have got.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:05.640]  You told me high-level FBI told you, Larry, tell Alex and everybody this is exactly, don't
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:06.640]  take the bait.
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:08.160]  And Trump, they said, get this to Trump.
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.160]  Do not do it.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:11.920]  And he didn't do what he should.
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:14.760]  You know, what are we going to do, Alex?
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:17.000]  You know, we beg.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:22.640]  Just don't take the bait, come out and say that the fix is in and tell people to be careful
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:23.640]  about this.
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:26.920]  How do you call it when we came over here and told?
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:28.120]  He would have devastated him.
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:29.280]  He would have devastated him.
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:30.280]  I tried.
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:33.560]  I can't control what I get a call from Trump.
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:36.640]  I try to get messages, and then, you know, I don't even call.
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:37.640]  I just, I know.
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:38.640]  He's not perfect.
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:41.240]  He wasn't battling the Clintons 20 years ago like we were.
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.240]  That's right.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:43.240]  We're waiting for you here.
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:44.240]  I know we're coming over here.
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:45.240]  We're waiting for you here.
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:46.240]  What do you do?
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:47.240]  I can't control.
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:48.240]  Oh, I see.
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:52.240]  God, I wish it was some new country to get out of here, too.
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:53.240]  God Almighty.
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:43:19.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:45.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:44:11.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:37.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:45:03.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:29.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:58.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:02.640]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:08.000]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.960]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.560]  at InfoWareShore.com.
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:18.400]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:22.480]  AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:27.720]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:31.840]  Customers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:33.600]  the products that you need each month.
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:38.240]  Just go to InfoWareShore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:41.320]  choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:46.640]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWareShore.com,
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:48.000]  this is a sure win.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.600]  10% off on AutoShip.
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:54.000]  Win, win, win at InfoWareShore.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:02.440]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:10.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:23.960]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:25.560]  the United States government.
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:31.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:38.800]  Do you still think that Jeff Hewlett brought down the World Trade Center?
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:44.040]  I'll tell you a couple of stories about fraud.
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:51.080]  The Bohemian Club, as you say, the Bohemian Club, that's where all those rich Republicans
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:56.160]  go out and stand naked against redwood trees, right?
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:59.480]  I've never been to the Bohemian Club, but you ought to go and be good for you, get some
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:00.480]  fresh air.
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:05.280]  I know nothing about the Bohemian Grove with Bill.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:10.280]  I know about once a month, he'll go out to Los Angeles.
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:18.680]  And she did it so regular that it became a bit of an issue trying to wash away where
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:20.680]  he's going.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:26.960]  Bill told me that she was going out there, she and a group of women, and she would be
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:29.680]  a part of a witches church.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:40.560]  And when Bill told me that you could have hit me with a baseball bat, I tried to point
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:41.560]  out to him.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:45.040]  He realized what had happened if that got out.
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:49.400]  Of course, my job was to make sure it didn't get out.
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:57.160]  Now, I don't know the day if Hillary still pertakes and the witch ritual.
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:01.800]  I don't know that I even know what the ritual was.
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:09.000]  But for the better part of many years, Hillary would go quite often, whether it was regularly
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:14.480]  once a month or maybe once every couple of months, she would go out on the weekend simply
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.880]  to be a part of it.
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:20.080]  All right, that was about a year ago and we went up there, we don't just believe people
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:21.800]  and I've known Larry 20 years at that time.
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:27.320]  We saw his medication, saw his diagnosis the whole nine yards, I gave him a donation then.
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:31.280]  We went up there to interview him because of the cancer and it's progressed.
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:33.880]  He's just trying to stay alive through the campaign to expose these people.
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:35.480]  It's why I can't be on TV today.
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:36.480]  We've been up there.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:37.480]  He's had heart surgery.
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:38.480]  You name it.
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:39.480]  I'm not going to get into all of it.
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:40.480]  He was in the hospital today.
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:42.040]  He's had his lungs collapsed.
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:43.040]  He's been resuscitated.
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:47.840]  He doesn't want me to say this on air, but then he tells me he's about to, you know,
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:48.840]  be out in the street.
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:53.040]  So I'm just going to tell you so he gets donations.
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:56.040]  Nichols live at AOL.com, PayPal, send the guy some money.
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:57.920]  He needs good treatment.
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:00.920]  He's been blackballed in Arkansas, everything's exposed to Clintons.
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:01.920]  He's a great patriot.
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:02.920]  He's a real deal.
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:03.920]  Nichols live at AOL.com.
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:04.920]  Give him a donation.
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:08.040]  He didn't even ask him for this, but he don't want me to talk about the illness, but I'm
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.840]  not going to sit there and just say send him a donation when the guy can't even get
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:11.840]  his treatments.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:12.840]  Keep him alive.
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:18.440]  As you know, Larry Nichols, 58 Kingsison Drive, Conway, Arkansas, 72034.
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:24.840]  Now Larry, folks need to make that donation.
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:29.480]  You told me 20 years ago she was in the witchcraft.
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:33.080]  You even told me about the handler who now has been the National Inquirer confirmed doing
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:35.200]  stuff for him.
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:37.800]  I separately, you didn't even know about this.
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:42.800]  He'd actually been in an LA liberal newspaper, because Tex Mars had a copy of it.
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:48.640]  I was in his archives, making my Bohemian Grove film 15 years ago, and I got a copy
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:50.200]  of her actually there.
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:53.400]  And this isn't just normal, you know, new age stuff or whatever.
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:55.000]  We're not talking about crystals or whatever.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.160]  A lot of nice folks are into all that stuff, better than a lot of these mainline church
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:00.520]  people I know.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:02.680]  This was Alistair Crowley's stuff.
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:06.080]  You don't know about this, but I've studied it, so I looked at what it was.
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:11.240]  Well, it came out in the WikiLeaks that this high priestess of this stuff, who admits in
[01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:16.600]  her own writing she does it, blood, you name it, they take kids of these parties, whether
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:20.440]  they're really killing people or not, it's so horrific to show it all.
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:22.720]  She's come out and said, oh, you know, it's all just a big joke.
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:23.720]  I'm not serious.
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:28.120]  I'm not a Satanist, but her email address is 666 at the end.
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:29.480]  And all this is going on.
[01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:32.680]  We know Petafile Island's real, Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:34.160]  We know Clinton.
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:35.920]  Bill went there 20 something times.
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:39.240]  We know that the law enforcement is saying they're going to have a press conference.
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:42.160]  He's sexting, you know, wiener, underage girls.
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:44.960]  We know that Bill Clinton went and practiced voodoo.
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:47.080]  That's in the Washington Post, his own bookie wrote.
[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:51.880]  We know these people are into the occult, but you knew them back when this was happening.
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:53.840]  So it's a very important facet.
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:57.960]  Now, I don't know about all this code work and kids and all the Reddit and big internet
[01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:02.320]  sites out there saying, Alex, why aren't you saying all this is code word for them?
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:05.000]  You know, well, they say, well, I'll have entertainment, three little kids in the hot
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.640]  tub for you at the farmhouse.
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:10.280]  And we've got all the wieners you want, you know, and the, you know, there's a lot of
[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:15.320]  pressure on us to get rid of this load of $20,000, uh, you know, you know, dolls for
[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:16.320]  you.
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:19.560]  I mean, it, I mean, it sounds really bad, but I don't know what it is.
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:21.720]  What are you as somebody that's been around these people?
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:22.840]  What the hell's going on?
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:29.480]  You know, Alex, all I can tell you is, man, finally, I had to go to, I literally had to
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:35.720]  go to her to try to get her to stop, I went to her, I said, Hillary, if we get caught
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:38.000]  when you go into this, which is church, we're done.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.560]  I mean, this is, you know, this is the early 80s, late 70s, whatever kind it was.
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:44.800]  And I said, there's no way we can cover that.
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:47.400]  But I said, here's, she said, there's no way she's going to go.
[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:52.800]  I said, well, then do this, a new channel, evidence crew, TV, local TV station, and little
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:53.800]  around.
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:58.120]  I said, look, you know, the methods church every Sunday, I'm going to set the crew,
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:01.520]  get you coming out of the church now, it's just happened, just like I'm going to tell
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:02.520]  you.
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:04.640]  You told me 20 years ago, you told me 20 years ago.
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:08.480]  Yeah, you're going to come out of the church and then you're going to talk about how happy
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:13.080]  you were to be in church and how, and you're going to profess Jesus Christ and God and
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:14.080]  all that.
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:15.080]  She turned away from me.
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:16.080]  She turned away.
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:22.120]  But before she took a step, she turned her head back to the left and she said, you know,
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:23.120]  I can't do that.
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:29.360]  And turned her head back around and walked away now, my problem is, I don't know about
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:30.360]  that code.
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:33.760]  I don't understand that John, he's, he's pledged yourself.
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:34.760]  What else have they'll tell you?
[01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:36.400]  What else have you not told people?
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:41.000]  Well, Bill would tell me about, you know, he got to deal with the Buddha, John.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.120]  I said, Buddha, he's a well, it wasn't about that.
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:44.120]  It was about the dope.
[01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:48.840]  You know, he said, man, they do all kinds of neat drugs, psychedelic drugs, so I don't
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:54.520]  know that his doodling experience had that much to do with it being, I guess, a religion,
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:57.880]  as it did for him to be able to have, you know, psychedelic drugs.
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:02.000]  Now, I just got a text, Alex just got it.
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:06.040]  It's from the senior FBI guy, I remember there were five that told me what was going
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:07.040]  on.
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:12.200]  Well, this morning, they just, they're listening to us now and he just sent me a text, two
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:19.560]  of the five received memo just morning stating that due to budgetary adjustments, they were
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:26.240]  going to be forced to take early retirement and the third of the three is to turn in his
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:30.080]  letter of resignation Monday.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:32.080]  So there you go.
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:35.800]  There you go.
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:39.400]  They're cooling out the final good men and women as we speak now.
[01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:43.440]  Again, Bill Clinton's in the Washington Post and his own book saying he loves Voodoo.
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:49.160]  I mean, this is how disconnected it, you know, you know, how hardcore this is.
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:52.440]  And then you've got Hillary involved in all this.
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:59.680]  And then we find out it's the most hardcore Alistair Crowley crap there is.
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:03.960]  And then you're trying to get her to go, listen, it was in mainstream news, Washington
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:08.080]  Post as well, that she does these sayings for the dead and liberals will be there.
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:10.840]  If you can call it the dead, Hillary, she's just getting them roped in.
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:12.440]  That's the first level they call it.
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:13.440]  Can we talk to Jesus?
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:19.080]  And she says, that's the one person we don't talk to that she said, I can't, you know,
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:20.080]  I can't do that.
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:24.920]  But that back, you told me that 20 years ago, that decade ago, the Washington Post asked,
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:27.640]  they were like, Oh, she does say answers.
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:28.640]  Who would she talk to?
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:29.640]  Well, not Jesus.
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:32.080]  She'd let you talk to anybody but Jesus.
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:33.080]  What is that?
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:35.080]  I mean, this lady is a veritable devil.
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:43.080]  Alex, it goes back to what I've told you since the day you and I met, you know, it was a
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:44.080]  good time for folks.
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:45.080]  That's all he is.
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:47.080]  He's an incident mile wide.
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:50.600]  Hillary is cold blooded.
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:55.320]  And I go back to the Benghazi, when she was talking about four dead Americans and she's
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:56.320]  their ends up.
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:58.200]  What difference does it make?
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:55:59.200]  Yeah.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:02.280]  Now that's the heart of his cold human being.
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:06.840]  As you're ever going to find, not to mention when a person she had had a 10 year affair
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:12.320]  with Vince Foster, which he's in California, here's, he's dead, but he died.
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:16.600]  She gets on a plane, but instead of coming back to Washington, I've got the central
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:17.920]  client service record.
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:24.280]  She lands in Little Rock, goes to their office at the Rose Law firm, ransacks his office,
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:29.480]  gets everything boxed up that has Hillary events on it and tells them to burn it.
[01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:30.480]  Wow.
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:32.600]  You talk about cold, buddy.
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:33.600]  That's cold.
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:39.360]  Well, I got to say 20 years, we've been talking 20 years, you, you are dead on and we appreciate
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:40.360]  you, Larry.
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:44.240]  Please come back on tomorrow during the 52 hour broadcast kicks off at 11am.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:47.640]  Let me tell you one thing, everybody's got to do this now.
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:50.680]  All of this stuff looks bad, but folks, you better get out and vote.
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:54.080]  And I'll say this to it and it's going to sound terrible, but I want to say it to every
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:59.000]  white American concerned that you better get out and vote because it's going to be your
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.640]  last chance.
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:01.960]  And again, it's not racially based.
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:04.040]  The media has made it racially based.
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:05.040]  That's right.
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:07.440]  And I have, I have no choice but to tell the truth about it.
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:10.440]  Alex, I don't, I don't want to get into a black conservative.
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:14.000]  Well, Larry, we know what's going on in Arkansas, the whole background of the Clintons and that
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  they're race based.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  They've just flipped the other way.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.360]  I just want everybody to live in peace, but it is racially based.
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:19.360]  It's very sad.
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:22.120]  And but the people voting racially are going to be screwed over.
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:23.120]  God bless you tomorrow.
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:24.120]  Thank Larry.
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:25.120]  Let's talk.
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:26.120]  Let's set you up now for tomorrow.
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:30.520]  I'm going to go hit the boys room, take a break and walk in there and broadcast for hours
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:45.080]  more out of my office because wild horses can't drag me away.
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:58:00.520]  I'm going to go hit the boys room, take a break and walk in there and broadcast for hours
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:11.920]  more out of my office because wild horses can't drag me away.
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:16.400]  It ain't gonna sit well down my way at all.
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:17.400]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:18.400]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:19.400]  It's time to ride, boys.
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:20.400]  We need a thousand paul revere.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:28.200]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:30.000]  And beef was for supper.
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:36.080]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:40.600]  Lauren Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin.
