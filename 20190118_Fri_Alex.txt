[00:00.000 --> 00:21.880]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones and now your
[00:21.880 --> 00:34.320]  host Owen Troyer you found it this is the tip of the spear when it comes to news and
[00:34.320 --> 00:43.520]  information and that is why we are the most censored news organization in the West potentially in
[00:43.520 --> 00:50.200]  the world in the history of the United States and that's not because we're crazy or loony or wrong
[00:50.200 --> 00:59.360]  it's because we're a threat to the establishment specifically the corporate media that has their
[00:59.360 --> 01:04.960]  little minions like Oliver Darcy and Brian Stelter hi guys tuned in every day to find
[01:04.960 --> 01:13.040]  something and some platform to get us banned from and the latest new way they censor us is
[01:13.040 --> 01:19.640]  with a pre-screening that they're calling news guard here's Greg Reese with that report a new
[01:19.640 --> 01:27.280]  chrome extension called news guard claims to restore trust and accountability by telling you
[01:27.280 --> 01:35.120]  what websites are lying to you and which ones are telling the truth they provide a news guard
[01:35.120 --> 01:42.360]  shield displayed in the top of your chrome browser that signals green if a website is trying to get
[01:42.360 --> 01:50.520]  it right and red if it has an agenda or knowingly publishes falsehoods or propaganda interestingly
[01:50.520 --> 01:57.520]  enough the news guard shield shows red on every website that questions the establishment narrative
[01:57.520 --> 02:06.600]  and shows green on every website that supports the establishment narrative for example establishment
[02:06.600 --> 02:14.520]  news site Forbes praises news guard saying news guard gets a leg up in the war on real fake
[02:14.520 --> 02:24.080]  news and Forbes gets a green shield from news guard RT a website that often questions the
[02:24.080 --> 02:31.960]  establishment narrative posts an article that is critical of news guard and RT gets a red shield
[02:31.960 --> 02:40.960]  from news guard on their website news guard asks why trust us and when we look at their advisory
[02:40.960 --> 02:48.640]  board we see Richard Stengel who proudly described himself to the council on foreign relations as
[02:48.640 --> 02:54.880]  a propagandist my old job at the State Department was what people used to joke as the chief propaganda
[02:54.880 --> 02:59.800]  as job we haven't talked about propaganda propaganda I'm not against propaganda every
[02:59.800 --> 03:04.280]  country does it and they have to do it to their own population and I don't necessarily think it's
[03:04.280 --> 03:12.240]  that awful we see retired general Michael Hayden former director of the CIA and NSA who has made
[03:12.240 --> 03:20.160]  multiple media appearances where he exclaims a clear strong bias against President Trump and at a
[03:20.160 --> 03:27.600]  press conference in July of 2018 the White House press secretary told reporters that in addition to
[03:27.600 --> 03:33.640]  revoking Brennan security clearance the president is considered revoking clearances for director
[03:33.640 --> 03:42.720]  James Comey James Clapper Michael Hayden Susan Rice and Andrew McCabe news guard is like a new
[03:42.720 --> 03:50.440]  version of snopes.com except rather than being run by one shady character news guard is run by a
[03:50.440 --> 03:57.200]  slew of establishment swamp creatures such as Gordon Krovitz of the council on foreign relations
[03:57.200 --> 04:05.720]  and former secretary of homeland security Tom Ridge news guard tells you what to believe so
[04:05.720 --> 04:11.680]  that you don't have to bother with the basic responsibility of due diligence the ruse is
[04:11.680 --> 04:18.960]  obvious to those thinking for themselves but news guard is only trying to corral the few sheeple
[04:18.960 --> 04:26.040]  the establishment have left in their stables they will only succeed at placating their ignorant flock
[04:26.040 --> 04:33.880]  so one has to ask how does the establishment plan to deal with those of us who think for
[04:33.880 --> 04:47.400]  ourselves this is Greg Reese for news wars.com that's right let someone else decide what's news
[04:47.400 --> 04:53.240]  let someone else decide what's real you can't trust yourself after all don't trust your own eyes
[04:53.240 --> 05:02.080]  don't trust your own ears trust the unseen whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our

[05:55.680 --> 06:15.040]  war store.com and now the tip of the spear leading the fight to take back the nation it's olyn shroyer
[06:15.040 --> 06:38.000]  listening to the alex joe show you know it's the same thing that we all already knew but going
[06:38.000 --> 06:47.600]  back down this road just to remind us of the environment we're in and the elements and
[06:47.600 --> 06:56.760]  the surroundings is what we have to do and when you now have pretty much everyone it's
[06:56.760 --> 07:03.560]  not just buzzfeed admitting that yeah we have no evidence of Trump Russia collusion I mean
[07:03.560 --> 07:07.960]  just about every news outlet I mean even Eric Swalwell goes on CNN in the midst yeah I've
[07:07.960 --> 07:17.120]  seen nothing even though he says he has it all so it's this amazing con game they play
[07:17.120 --> 07:29.520]  and Russian collusion of course is just one instance one example but think about the state
[07:29.520 --> 07:39.800]  of our country when you have hundreds of congressmen and women dozens if not hundreds of people
[07:39.800 --> 07:51.600]  in the media that are so overwhelmed by hatred so overwhelmed by disgust that they knowingly
[07:51.600 --> 08:00.080]  go along with a false narrative Russian collusion simply because they hate you and they hate
[08:00.080 --> 08:15.520]  that you elected Donald Trump and the bitterness turns into total hysteria the good news is
[08:15.520 --> 08:22.440]  from an anonymous source that wrote an op-ed in the Daily Caller there are 15% if you call
[08:22.440 --> 08:31.400]  that good news 15% of the men and women in Congress actually care and are actually patriots
[08:31.400 --> 08:36.880]  of course you know you can count maybe 0% of Democrats for that statistic thought maybe
[08:36.880 --> 08:45.880]  Tulsi Gabbard but she goes with the whole PC thing so she's out but Jim Jordan is one
[08:45.880 --> 08:54.040]  of the congressmen that's really doing his job but just doing your job in Congress now
[08:54.040 --> 09:05.840]  makes you almost a hero a legend in modern times and so while the Democrats and the
[09:05.840 --> 09:12.280]  mainstream media are sitting here figuring the latest way they can spin up some hysteria
[09:12.280 --> 09:17.480]  over Russian collusion it'll be Michael Cohen today it'll be the dossier tomorrow it'll
[09:17.480 --> 09:27.960]  be who knows next week let's not forget that you also have the Democrats doing anything
[09:27.960 --> 09:36.120]  and everything they can to stop a wall at the border where I've got a ton of stories
[09:36.120 --> 09:43.000]  today that I could get to about why we need a wall but let's just remind ourselves the
[09:43.000 --> 09:52.760]  total scum baggery of the Democrat Party broken down so eloquently by Jim Jordan in Congress
[09:52.760 --> 09:59.480]  yesterday today's left has taken the most radical positions in American history they
[09:59.480 --> 10:04.200]  applaud Kaepernick when he disrespects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when he says
[10:04.200 --> 10:09.520]  America was never that great we're not gonna make America great again it was never that
[10:09.520 --> 10:15.040]  great and they cheer on Maxine Waters when she says go out and harass anyone who supports
[10:15.040 --> 10:39.480]  the president today's left thinks that America is just another country just one of the hundred
[10:39.480 --> 10:44.200]  ninety some countries on the planet United States of America is not just another country
[10:44.200 --> 10:50.360]  it's the greatest nation in history that has done more good for more people than any country
[10:50.360 --> 10:57.440]  ever a special place where people from all over the world all shapes all sizes all colors
[10:57.440 --> 11:03.760]  all talents come to so they can chase down their goals chase down their dreams make life
[11:03.760 --> 11:08.920]  better for themselves and their family that's this country a special place where people
[11:08.920 --> 11:14.360]  come and respect the Constitution cherish the Bill of Rights and embrace the rule of
[11:14.360 --> 11:21.880]  law Democrat Congressman Blumenauer said abolish ICE Secretary Clinton when she was running
[11:21.880 --> 11:26.760]  for the highest office in the land said we need a borderless hemisphere we've learned
[11:26.760 --> 11:31.800]  from the wiki lakes that you said this and I want to quote my dream is a hemispheric
[11:31.800 --> 11:37.800]  common market with open trade and open borders I will continue speaking out for comprehensive
[11:37.800 --> 11:43.400]  immigration reform I think the people who are here deserve a path to citizenship speaker
[11:43.400 --> 11:52.040]  Pelosi said walls are immoral just last week Stacey Abrams governor candidate the state
[11:52.040 --> 11:58.080]  of Georgia said non-citizens should be able to vote think about that so in some cases
[11:58.080 --> 12:03.480]  you would be supportive of non-citizens but I wouldn't oppose it she wouldn't oppose it
[12:03.480 --> 12:09.680]  but she sounds like she is open to non-citizens voting in local elections Americans believe
[12:09.680 --> 12:15.840]  that borders need to be strong Americans believe we believe that there's a difference a big
[12:15.840 --> 12:20.760]  difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration and Americans and Republicans
[12:20.760 --> 12:25.320]  in the House Freedom Caucus believe that a border security wall will help stop drug
[12:25.320 --> 12:33.440]  problem the gang problem and the human trafficking problem you know it's hard to come on
[12:33.440 --> 12:41.120]  here and to voice the concern that I have it's hard to come on here and voice all the
[12:41.120 --> 12:50.280]  issues that are going on right now but the real challenge is not for me to figure out
[12:50.280 --> 12:59.880]  how to voice this but to figure out what it's going to take for the common man in America
[12:59.880 --> 13:04.760]  what it's going to take for the average American citizen to wake up and realize there is some
[13:04.760 --> 13:11.360]  serious trouble afoot I mean let's just look at three stories right now that are all huge
[13:11.360 --> 13:17.160]  they're just three stories in a smattering a total fake news story Russian collusion
[13:17.160 --> 13:22.480]  that has one side of the aisle totally convinced Donald Trump and his associates are all going
[13:22.480 --> 13:27.120]  to be in jail that's where they're at for Russian collusion a total fake news narrative
[13:27.120 --> 13:31.120]  hundred percent hoax unless you're talking about Hillary Clinton you've got a wide open
[13:31.120 --> 13:35.360]  border and a humanitarian crisis at the border not even mentioning the humanitarian crisis
[13:35.360 --> 13:38.960]  you have in California right now which will cover that so a total disaster happening at
[13:38.960 --> 13:43.360]  the border right now the Democrats want to do nothing about it you have the total attack
[13:43.360 --> 13:49.480]  on free speech in the West right now where you've probably seen the story from free
[13:49.480 --> 13:55.320]  press about how they want Alex Jones off the air they got a new story today ladies and
[13:55.320 --> 14:02.400]  gentlemen responding to this free press verse hate conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is so
[14:02.400 --> 14:07.480]  racist homophobic and xenophobic that Apple Facebook Spotify Twitter and YouTube banned
[14:07.480 --> 14:15.280]  him and to show info wars from their sites in 2018 but now he's returned to Facebook
[14:15.280 --> 14:19.960]  with multiple new pages and the social media giant has allowed him to resume profiting
[14:19.960 --> 14:28.600]  off lies and hate that's from the free speech net two days ago now they've launched another
[14:28.600 --> 14:33.680]  petition to have us banned off everything else anywhere we exist and again this is from
[14:33.680 --> 14:41.480]  the free press that want us shut down and then you have the council on foreign relations
[14:41.480 --> 14:49.040]  and Michael Hayden and others giving you news screenings and telling you what you can trust
[14:49.040 --> 14:55.320]  and what you can't trust because after all you can't trust yourself that's what they're
[14:55.320 --> 15:05.360]  really saying don't trust yourself trust us which is exactly what a tyrant would say
[15:05.360 --> 15:11.240]  exactly what an authoritarian would say exactly what a totalitarian would say exactly what
[15:11.240 --> 15:18.800]  a blood sucking demon would say and so that's where we're at today now Alex Jones is going
[15:18.800 --> 15:24.760]  to be joining us in not too long with breaking news and some other developments that he's

[18:05.520 --> 18:10.800]  we have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[18:10.800 --> 18:17.560]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function
[18:17.560 --> 18:23.520]  in the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.520 --> 18:28.920]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in published
[18:28.920 --> 18:35.040]  trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet
[18:35.040 --> 18:40.600]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is
[18:40.600 --> 18:45.680]  not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking
[18:45.680 --> 18:51.080]  the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses

[19:20.920 --> 19:25.480]  to look back and say you know that we struggled here we made it and that's really where this
[19:25.480 --> 19:30.040]  goes but yeah God's got a big war for you ready and so if you can't face George Soros
[19:30.040 --> 19:33.720]  and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong are you going to really be able
[19:33.720 --> 19:39.000]  to face the other stuff because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.400]  and are also ready to fight you don't go to the next level without getting a big weight
[19:42.400 --> 19:45.800]  put on your back and I mean I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future I mean
[19:45.800 --> 19:50.640]  all I know is I want to go with the master built I want to go to the next level I want
[19:50.640 --> 19:55.360]  to be with the spirit that I've experienced not these devil worshipers they're cold and
[19:55.360 --> 20:04.960]  failed and those are being attuned I want life I want Jesus you're listening to the Alex
[20:04.960 --> 20:20.720]  Jones show from the front lines of the information war it's Owen shroyer you're listening to the
[20:20.720 --> 20:29.640]  Alex Jones show you know I'm not one that really feels pressure or nervous or or ever
[20:29.640 --> 20:46.200]  star struck or anything like that but there's a weight to try to properly put this information
[20:46.200 --> 20:58.520]  out there and the challenge is to just really somehow translate the gravity of the situation
[20:58.520 --> 21:05.400]  we're in I know the average audience member knows this but this should be a no brainer
[21:05.400 --> 21:10.680]  for example the crew just brought me some news stories because I'm about to go to this
[21:10.680 --> 21:16.160]  clip BuzzFeed reporter admits you know there's no Russian collusion in fact you know we ought
[21:16.160 --> 21:21.080]  to get the Van Jones undercover tape to where Van Jones says that the Russian collusion
[21:21.080 --> 21:25.480]  things and nothing burger let's let's get the CNN producer these are project Veritas
[21:25.480 --> 21:29.800]  tapes let's get the CNN producer admitting CNN has no journalistic integrity they laugh
[21:29.800 --> 21:33.000]  about it it's all about giving you the Trump hate because that's what they think their
[21:33.000 --> 21:41.800]  audience wants but I mean what am I supposed to say how am I supposed to properly disseminate
[21:41.800 --> 21:45.760]  this information if you can't already see it for yourself does that make sense it's
[21:45.760 --> 21:56.760]  like if you are looking at a painting let's say you're looking at a famous Rembrandt and
[21:56.760 --> 22:09.480]  we're both looking at it like how do I explain it to you if you can't already see it I mean
[22:09.480 --> 22:19.800]  it's shocking when even Snopes admits this is from the fact checker Snopes did Hillary
[22:19.800 --> 22:26.680]  Clinton tell FBI's Robert Mueller to deliver uranium to Russians in 2009 secret tarmac
[22:26.680 --> 22:35.320]  meeting the answer is yes but why stop there the New York Times documented the whole thing
[22:35.320 --> 22:43.920]  in a 17 page report in April of 2015 how Hillary Clinton made Russia's Vladimir Putin the
[22:43.920 --> 22:56.360]  number one the number one possessor of enriched uranium thank you Hillary but what do you get
[22:56.360 --> 23:01.920]  all day on the news Trump Russia Trump Russia Trump Russia all fake what do you get from
[23:01.920 --> 23:09.480]  these reporters Michael Cohen Roger Stone Paul Manafort Jerry Corsi where's the Russian
[23:09.480 --> 23:19.000]  collusion so that's a political witch hunt that's landed people in jail solitary confinement
[23:19.000 --> 23:26.920]  Hillary Clinton walks free one of the biggest criminals if not the biggest criminal in the
[23:26.920 --> 23:36.840]  history of the United States government maybe Obama but let's go to this clip of a Buzz
[23:36.840 --> 23:42.480]  Feed reporter admitting just like the rest of them I mean Swalwell goes on TV and admits
[23:42.480 --> 23:47.680]  they got nothing now even though he claims he has something he admits he really has nothing
[23:47.680 --> 23:52.560]  so here's the Buzz Feed reporter admitting well there really is no Russian inclusion
[23:52.560 --> 23:59.680]  but we're still going to report on it all day you tell us Anthony the evidence I know
[23:59.680 --> 24:04.640]  that in the report you say that you have spoken you have two law enforcement sources who tell
[24:04.640 --> 24:12.080]  you that they have seen who are these people texts emails a cache of other documents maybe
[24:12.080 --> 24:18.520]  transcripts with other witnesses in Trump organization that Donald Trump pressured Michael
[24:18.520 --> 24:24.360]  Cohen to lie he's a born perjury have you seen any of that other corroborating evidence
[24:24.360 --> 24:27.720]  no I'm not seeing it personally but the folks that we've talked to the two officials that
[24:27.720 --> 24:36.960]  we spoke to are fully 100% read in to that aspect of the special count yeah he's talking
[24:36.960 --> 24:47.880]  about Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff two liars two Democrat henchmen out in California you
[24:47.880 --> 24:52.040]  know what goes on out there folks do I really need to spell it out for you you know what
[24:52.040 --> 25:04.040]  goes on in Adam Schiff's district folks you know what happens at Ed Buck's house so again
[25:04.040 --> 25:16.400]  I mean I know it's all fake I know who these people are but what can I do how can I properly
[25:16.400 --> 25:26.680]  read this information which is not my opinion okay but you go to the source but you have
[25:26.680 --> 25:33.680]  the entire nation in a tizzy now over fake Russian collusion and you know you would you
[25:33.680 --> 25:44.240]  really want to know how on a razor's edge this country is if you go to the right side
[25:44.240 --> 25:51.160]  of the political aisle in America what do you get which is the majority by the way it's
[25:51.160 --> 25:54.760]  it's really not even close that's one of the biggest conjobs the media is pulling on us
[25:54.760 --> 25:59.920]  right now is that Trump's base and conservatism in America first isn't the majority opinion
[25:59.920 --> 26:15.880]  it's a super majority unless you're in you know LA or New York but just think about
[26:15.880 --> 26:25.640]  what it means to have a media and a Democrat party knowingly lie to you for two years think
[26:25.640 --> 26:31.920]  about what it means that they try to censor any news organization that goes against their
[26:31.920 --> 26:38.480]  lives think about a Democrat party that wants to put Trump in jail for Russian collusion
[26:38.480 --> 26:42.960]  even though it's all literally all of it is Hillary Clinton the Democrats but but but
[26:42.960 --> 26:46.760]  let me get back to my point here's how on a razor's edge this country is right now if
[26:46.760 --> 26:52.080]  you go to the political right in this country what are they saying what do they want forget
[26:52.080 --> 27:00.360]  the wall and all the other political footballs out there let's really get down to firebrand
[27:00.360 --> 27:14.600]  politics at the very the very motivating factor for why people are so upset right now with
[27:14.600 --> 27:20.560]  the Democrat party if you go to the political right what do people want Hillary Clinton
[27:20.560 --> 27:26.680]  in jail Barack Obama in jail just let's say the deep state in jail for all the crimes
[27:26.680 --> 27:31.600]  that they've committed so so that's so right now that's where you're at on the political
[27:31.600 --> 27:36.040]  right put all these people in jail for the crimes we know they committed and it's all
[27:36.040 --> 27:41.000]  on record that's just I mean again the uranium one deal that's one thing Hillary Clinton
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.720]  using Russian intelligence to make a fake dossier that's another thing the Obama administration
[27:46.720 --> 27:50.400]  using that dossier to spy on the Trump campaign illegally that's another thing but that's all
[27:50.400 --> 27:55.360]  on record that's all admitted but then let's go to the political left of the aisle in America
[27:55.360 --> 28:01.280]  and what do they say they want Trump in jail they want all of Trump's associates in jail
[28:01.280 --> 28:05.440]  they want Trump impeached they think he's a Russian asset they think he's treasonous
[28:05.440 --> 28:11.160]  they think he's putting kids in cages they think all the worst things that you've heard
[28:11.160 --> 28:18.240]  so if you go to the firebrand political conservative and the firebrand political progressive liberal
[28:18.240 --> 28:27.200]  they both want their opposition in jail and they're both waited they're both waiting for
[28:27.200 --> 28:33.600]  it to happen because of course well yeah we know that James Comey perjured himself we
[28:33.600 --> 28:38.240]  know that Sundar Pichai perjured himself we know that Hillary Clinton made Vladimir Putin
[28:38.240 --> 28:43.840]  the number one possessor of enriched uranium in the world like he wanted to be but if you're
[28:43.840 --> 28:48.320]  on the left they know that Trump colluded with Russia they know that it was Trump's administration
[28:48.320 --> 28:53.040]  that stole the election they know it was all bad and both sides are just waiting for the
[28:53.040 --> 28:57.520]  opposition to get in jail just waiting for the opposition to get in jail and none of it happens

[37:41.840 --> 37:48.320]  how we produce more content the women's march is this weekend in DC and we will be there with
[37:48.320 --> 37:53.120]  multiple reporters now you can imagine the type of stuff we may see at the women's march if it's
[37:53.120 --> 38:05.840]  anything like last year we'll end up back on drudgereport.com now let me just focus and get to some
[38:05.840 --> 38:15.520]  of this news where to begin well again buzzfeed reporter admits he hasn't seen any evidence to
[38:15.520 --> 38:21.120]  validate trump tower story of course this is the same buzzfeed that took the knowingly fabricated
[38:21.120 --> 38:28.320]  russian dossier published it as if it were real even though they admitted it wasn't real and then
[38:28.320 --> 38:36.000]  of course well you know the rest of the story president trump just dunked on nancy polosi this
[38:36.000 --> 38:41.600]  is from this is at info wars.com michael snider end of the american dream president trump just
[38:41.600 --> 38:45.920]  dunked on nancy polosi with a power move that has never happened in the annals of congressional
[38:45.920 --> 38:52.000]  history yeah and then it turned out to be quite an awkward moment for the democrats after trump
[38:52.000 --> 38:58.800]  canceled polosi's flight an hour before takeoff and then what happened they were driving around
[38:58.800 --> 39:08.720]  in circles in washington dc because they didn't know what to do just pathetic just pathetic
[39:08.720 --> 39:14.320]  in fact i think we have some b-roll of that the stranded bus that had polosi and shiff i mean it's
[39:14.320 --> 39:19.760]  one of the most awkward things so they cancel the trip they're all on this bus and they're
[39:19.760 --> 39:25.280]  they're doing circles around dc the media knows it so the media is kind of following them around
[39:25.280 --> 39:32.560]  they're kind of hopping in and off the bus and it just it really just kind of personifies who
[39:32.560 --> 39:41.600]  these people are there nothing just drive around the bus you know and walk around dc like oh yeah
[39:41.600 --> 39:50.640]  this is just what we do meanwhile they're still collecting a paycheck how do you like that kim
[39:50.640 --> 39:57.040]  jordan's inspiring speech electrifies the internet that's at info wars dot com we played that in the
[39:57.040 --> 40:03.200]  first segment free press literally the name of the organization is free press is totally out to
[40:03.200 --> 40:07.600]  get alex jones and they're doubling and tripling down on it even though everyone that follows the
[40:07.600 --> 40:10.880]  free press is like wait you're free press why are you attacking info wars why are you attacking
[40:10.880 --> 40:17.200]  alex jones aren't you for free press well they're saying no we are not free press so that's just
[40:17.200 --> 40:22.160]  what they're saying now we just don't have the right to exist we don't have the right to broadcast
[40:22.160 --> 40:30.400]  we don't have the right to be on social media just shut us down because we're so hateful you know by
[40:30.400 --> 40:41.360]  the way i can't even i honestly cannot even fathom the mind of a modern-day leftist because
[40:41.360 --> 40:44.960]  there's so many things i mean that the mental gymnastics that they have to do in their head
[40:44.960 --> 40:48.960]  i can't even i cannot even comprehend think about it like this let's just give one example
[40:48.960 --> 40:55.200]  of something that's trending recently having a beard is considered toxic masculinity you right
[40:55.200 --> 41:01.040]  you have a beard toxic masculinity i've got to shave your beard as you let again i'm not trying
[41:01.040 --> 41:09.200]  to be hateful here but let's just point out the facts so are muslim men gonna have to shave their
[41:09.200 --> 41:15.440]  beards are muslim men toxic masculinity i mean really if you want to look at anything that
[41:15.440 --> 41:21.440]  personifies toxic masculinity it would be the old 17th century islam that a lot of these people are
[41:21.440 --> 41:28.400]  still practicing someone asked me because uh they sent me a video from back in 2017 when
[41:28.400 --> 41:32.240]  steven crowder went to a bunch of muslim bakeries and asked them to make gay cakes they all they
[41:32.240 --> 41:38.400]  all turned them down did it make national news nah was there a lawsuit nah and then someone asked
[41:39.760 --> 41:46.080]  i forget the imam on twitter are there any muslims are there any places in the religion of islam
[41:46.080 --> 41:50.720]  where you can have a gay marriage and the imam said yes at the top of the roof before they push you
[41:50.720 --> 41:59.120]  off but this is what the left is inviting into america because they're tolerant and loving but
[41:59.120 --> 42:03.360]  see that's what i'm saying it's the mental gymnastics that these people do and so now
[42:04.160 --> 42:10.160]  the dnc which never was actually an official sponsor or or anything with the women's march
[42:10.160 --> 42:14.320]  the dnc says we disavow the women's march for antisemitism even though they were never
[42:14.320 --> 42:17.920]  sponsored or anything with the women's march they were never officially connected to it
[42:17.920 --> 42:24.800]  but they disavowed for antisemitism why because linda sarsour is an israel jew hater
[42:26.320 --> 42:32.560]  linda cockroach that's what her name translates to well it's beautiful cockroach but so are the
[42:32.560 --> 42:38.000]  is the dnc gonna disavow ilhan omar because she has a map in her office that doesn't even have
[42:38.000 --> 42:45.200]  israel on it just palestine is the dnc going to disavow rashida tleep who also says israel
[42:45.200 --> 42:50.640]  has no right to exist so do you see the mental gymnastics these people have to do
[42:50.640 --> 42:54.480]  and it doesn't stop there i mean it goes everything with these people hillary clinton
[42:54.480 --> 43:00.560]  including with russia giving Putin the uranium one deal i mean it's everything living in volcano
[43:00.560 --> 43:06.400]  may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates
[43:06.400 --> 43:11.360]  but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash
[43:11.360 --> 43:18.080]  and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph
[43:18.080 --> 43:24.240]  of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[43:24.240 --> 43:30.080]  alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals
[43:30.080 --> 43:36.080]  and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our elixir pure gravity filter
[43:36.080 --> 43:41.920]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored to
[43:41.920 --> 43:48.880]  optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the elixir pure raises the ph of the water so what
[43:48.880 --> 43:54.640]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more
[43:54.640 --> 44:01.280]  importantly a good water filtration system will purify it as the years go by it gets harder and

[46:49.760 --> 46:57.360]  rallying cry to restore the first amendment creativity and the dynamic human spirit that
[46:57.360 --> 47:22.320]  refuses to submit you're listening to the alex jones show you found it the tip of the spear
[47:22.320 --> 47:31.520]  it is the alex jones show with oen shawyer folks we're going to be getting breaking news here
[47:31.520 --> 47:37.920]  shortly from alex jones and i just want to explain something in case people can't fully
[47:37.920 --> 47:45.440]  understand what the censorship has done alex is busy dealing with a lot of behind the scene
[47:45.440 --> 47:50.400]  stuff obviously a lot of this stuff kind of goes into the public with the news they talk about
[47:50.400 --> 47:54.720]  with the lawsuits and everything obviously the attack on us censoring us and everything so
[47:54.720 --> 48:01.680]  what they've done is they've they've basically put alex into a box where the only the only place
[48:01.680 --> 48:06.720]  where he can at the flick of a switch reach a million people is right here so he can't go
[48:06.720 --> 48:10.400]  go live on youtube and reach a million people with a message he can't go live on facebook or
[48:10.400 --> 48:14.000]  twitter and reach a million people with the message in the flick of a switch like he used to be able
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.800]  to do so you know when he's out doing stuff behind the scenes dealing with all of this stuff on a
[48:18.800 --> 48:24.080]  day like today it's super frustrating for him because he's got breaking news there's major
[48:24.080 --> 48:29.760]  developments happening and he has to try to deal with everything behind the scenes and somehow get
[48:29.760 --> 48:35.600]  the message into the alex jones show because this is where they've boxed him into the last place he
[48:35.600 --> 48:40.000]  can go to get millions of people to hear his message so we got an emergency message coming
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.040]  up from alex shortly and he's going to be joining us before the end of the show
[48:43.040 --> 48:48.800]  so and we've got some other stuff i'm going to get to with some guests coming up as well
[48:50.400 --> 48:58.720]  but i just got this story handed to me suspect attacks arizona officer charged with terrorism and
[49:00.720 --> 49:06.000]  i had i don't even know what you want to say it was like just this humbling moment but it was
[49:06.000 --> 49:17.600]  really just it just grounded me in how ridiculous it all really is because in the last year think about
[49:17.600 --> 49:24.160]  this in the last year the biggest news story has pretty much been the same as far as what the mainstream
[49:24.160 --> 49:29.120]  media wants to push and that's trump bad whether that's russian inclusion government shutdown
[49:29.120 --> 49:33.280]  whatever trump bad is the main story right trump is the worst thing ever i mean you know you've heard
[49:33.280 --> 49:43.120]  it all in the last year do you know that there have been multiple major terror attacks thwarted
[49:43.840 --> 49:52.320]  in this country last fourth of july you had a radical leftist that was attempting to blow up
[49:52.320 --> 50:02.640]  a fourth of july parade in cleveland you had a compound in new mexico where two jihadis were
[50:02.640 --> 50:10.720]  training children how to go into schools and murder children they also ritualist ritualistically
[50:10.720 --> 50:19.360]  sacrificed a child no big deal there was a huge story was it yesterday two days ago i mean it's
[50:19.360 --> 50:25.520]  like a blip on the radar they they just stopped another major terror attack from happening there
[50:25.520 --> 50:31.680]  was some guy trying to bomb the white house but this is like oh just a blip on the radar just
[50:31.680 --> 50:39.120]  up terrorist tries to bomb the white house okay moving on and so now this comes out today suspect
[50:39.120 --> 50:47.200]  attacks arizona officer charged with multiple accounts of terrorism and of course it's a
[50:47.200 --> 50:53.360]  suspected jihadist they believe it could be isis inspired and he's got his nice toxic masculine
[50:53.360 --> 50:59.280]  you know beard too which is bad unless it's a muslim i suppose it's a white male your
[50:59.280 --> 51:07.200]  beard's toxic if it's a muslim then it's loving so i mean i'm just sitting here like oh my god
[51:08.640 --> 51:15.200]  we get nothing you get multiple terror attacks thwarted could be major terror attack i mean who
[51:15.200 --> 51:22.640]  knows what's going on here a terror compound in new mexico with dead children and you get nothing
[51:22.640 --> 51:30.960]  it's like it doesn't even happen and then of course the news story comes out and goes mainstream
[51:30.960 --> 51:36.160]  yesterday all the prayer rugs found at the border info wars broke that in 2017 we had an interview
[51:36.160 --> 51:39.680]  where the guy was talking about finding all these prayer rugs i don't know what the hell is going
[51:39.680 --> 51:44.880]  on we claim to be at war with islam we're in seven different islamic countries you know
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  the border patrol says we get people from 48 different countries coming across the border
[51:50.000 --> 51:54.160]  here nearly every day you don't think that some of these muslim countries we've been bombing for
[51:54.160 --> 52:02.880]  years might try to slip some jihadis across that wide open border but it doesn't even matter
[52:04.640 --> 52:08.640]  it doesn't even matter it doesn't even matter if they thwart a terror attack attempted on a fourth
[52:08.640 --> 52:12.720]  of july parade it doesn't even matter if they thwart a terror attack attempted on the white house
[52:12.720 --> 52:21.440]  oh oh was it what was the one so they found some like a bomb that weighed like a ton in some guy's
[52:21.440 --> 52:31.120]  backyard that he was trying to blow up i think that was in dc you have video of armed men walking
[52:31.120 --> 52:39.360]  across the border this is just i mean it's just insane it's just this is lunatic society no common
[52:39.360 --> 52:45.040]  sense no logic no reasoning just whatever's politically advantageous for me whatever's
[52:45.040 --> 53:01.920]  politically correct for me just insane uh but you know what the ideological left the ideological
[53:01.920 --> 53:12.400]  left will end all borders ladies and gentlemen and i realized something what the real role here
[53:12.400 --> 53:17.280]  is on an individual level for someone like myself and for you
[53:20.880 --> 53:28.320]  the ideological left will end all borders i'm not just talking about countries ladies and gentlemen
[53:28.320 --> 53:35.440]  the ideological left has already ended the borders of human biology the ideological
[53:35.440 --> 53:40.960]  left has already ended the borders of human sexuality the ideological left has already
[53:40.960 --> 53:45.360]  ended the borders of the innocence of children
[53:48.960 --> 53:53.360]  ending the border of a country is a joke to these people
[53:53.360 --> 54:00.320]  so yes the ideological left will end all borders
[54:02.720 --> 54:08.320]  and that's the resistance is victory factor because we have to be a governor on these people
[54:08.320 --> 54:14.240]  we have to be a check on these people these people want to dive in head first into a one
[54:14.240 --> 54:23.120]  inch deep body of water and so we're simply saying look you're gonna dive and we're probably gonna
[54:23.120 --> 54:31.280]  die so can we at least wait until the water hits like 10 feet before we jump to our death like can
[54:31.280 --> 54:38.560]  we at least try to soften the blow before we jump to our death here but that's what it is it's all
[54:38.560 --> 54:43.680]  about ending all borders the borders of sexual sexuality the borders of biology the borders of
[54:43.680 --> 54:50.960]  common sense the borders of reality even and and see and i talked about the mental gymnastics
[54:50.960 --> 54:56.560]  of a leftist i can't even imagine of course they they these people all the social constructs that
[54:56.560 --> 55:02.800]  they have in their mind here's why they here here's why the average leftist struggles with society
[55:02.800 --> 55:08.320]  struggles with reality because all the social constructs that they have that they've invented
[55:08.320 --> 55:14.240]  exist only in their minds they don't exist in the real world so of course when you go out and you
[55:14.240 --> 55:19.040]  try to apply a leftist ideology to the real world you're going to be confused and disoriented
[55:19.040 --> 55:23.680]  which will eventually lead to anger and outrage which is what we see from these people well of
[55:23.680 --> 55:28.800]  course inevitably that's all you're going to get when the social construct that you've created in
[55:28.800 --> 55:35.440]  your mind only exists in your mind and when you try to apply it to reality it doesn't work of course
[55:35.440 --> 55:45.040]  you're going to be frustrated of course you're going to be confused but again we're just like a
[55:45.040 --> 55:51.280]  governor here like okay you're going to jump off this cliff you're going to splatter your brains
[55:51.280 --> 55:56.720]  and guts all over the ground okay you're you've already decided that you already decided that's
[55:56.720 --> 56:01.760]  what you want to do with humanity okay can we just we're just sitting here trying to hold them back
[56:01.760 --> 56:07.440]  saying let's wait till some of the water builds up before we dive head first okay let's maybe five
[56:07.440 --> 56:13.760]  feet 10 feet 20 feet maybe we'll survive but no these people are ready to go jump off jump off
[56:13.760 --> 56:21.280]  let's jump into that one inch deep water right now from 50 feet high and we're just like okay slow down
[56:23.040 --> 56:26.560]  this jump will lead to our death no it won't you racist
[56:28.800 --> 56:32.800]  all right so anyway folks we're going to have an emergency message from Alex Jones coming
[56:32.800 --> 56:37.440]  up I didn't even really get to the news but it's just it's just all feels so trivial to me
[56:38.400 --> 56:42.400]  because if the if the person cannot see what's going on in front of their eyes
[56:42.400 --> 56:46.480]  as far as the corruption the lies and everything then what what good is it do me covering the news
[56:46.480 --> 56:52.000]  you know if we don't even care about mass terror attacks being thwarted if we don't care about all
[56:52.000 --> 56:58.960]  the drugs and terror and crime that comes across I mean you know what's the big deal illegal voting
[56:58.960 --> 57:04.320]  in uh you know Washington DC continuing the government funding a planned parenthood uh
[57:05.040 --> 57:12.080]  you know uh new caravans are coming across the border I mean who cares we're going to jump off
[57:12.080 --> 57:19.760]  that cliff to our death anyway so that's what we've got so we're going to be joined in the next
[57:19.760 --> 57:24.320]  hour by Andrew Lawrence who confronted that racist professor who says killing white people
[57:24.320 --> 57:32.000]  is a skill okay and again whatever this guy's not gonna he's not gonna stop me from accomplishing
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.560]  whatever I want to do whatever uh but again you just have to look at the society and wonder
[57:36.560 --> 57:41.120]  why a statement like that why you can be racist against white people it's even trained but if
[57:41.120 --> 57:45.680]  you reversed it well then now all of a sudden it's a non-issue
[57:50.720 --> 57:57.680]  we need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom our freedoms don't consist of
[57:57.680 --> 58:01.120]  the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper it consists of the things that we're willing to
[58:01.120 --> 58:06.480]  fight for the first amendment the bill of rights the rest of the bill of rights are prohibitions
[58:06.480 --> 58:12.960]  they're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those god-given rights from
[58:12.960 --> 58:16.560]  us as individuals you better understand that because they're taking them right now
[58:19.840 --> 58:24.880]  we have seen what they want to do they called it UN agenda 21 now they call it the UN 2030
[58:24.880 --> 58:30.560]  agenda they want everybody off of the rural lands they want people out of the suburbs they want to
[58:30.560 --> 58:37.440]  pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone it's
[58:37.440 --> 58:47.040]  the david night show never missed your show any day and i mean i mean never at info wars.com

[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:30.240]  all right we've actually asked this professor irami osai frimpong who is encouraging people
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:36.160]  to fight and kill white people uh a total racist but he's not racist because he's black so you
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:43.200]  can't be racist if you're black one of the biggest i don't even know how somebody could just anyway
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:49.520]  oh i'm sorry see i had these moments which is just the reality of the insanity hits you and it's
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:55.200]  just like it's like a wall man it's just like it stops you dead in your tracks anyway one of
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:00.240]  the students who's going to be joining us this hour andrew lorence confronted this racist professor
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:10.640]  here is how that went you said that every suburban community in georgia raises white
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:15.680]  supremacists how can you possibly say that you don't know what every white community in georgia
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:21.520]  does well i'll pause this real quick pause this real quick i hadn't seen this video yet i can already
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:28.320]  tell andrew lorence is a toxic masculinity do you hear that man do you hear the confidence in that
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:33.120]  man's voice to stand up for what he believes in what a toxic masculinity you see this is what america
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:38.720]  has way too much of folks men who stand up for what they believe in men who aren't going to cowardice
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:45.680]  to political correctness and bullying and the hate mobs of the left that cry racism whenever
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:52.800]  they feel embarrassed or upset so so this is the problem with america is men like andrew lorence
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:02:00.400]  who stand up for what he believes in and speaks with confidence against racists like irami frimpong
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:06.240]  so yeah this is what they want to end in this country they don't want someone to stand up to
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:19.520]  the leftist brainwashing cult all right let's go back i live in one too and i didn't have the typical
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:26.640]  heterosexual uh no i'm talking now i did not have the same heterosexual experience that people in
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:31.200]  these communities had so how can you generalize me into the stereotype when you don't know my
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.040]  experiences so you just ask them a question i was going to answer it okay i don't feel like he's
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:39.840]  answered my question at all i didn't even realize y'all yelled at me while i was trying to ask my
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:44.080]  question hopefully just ask one now let him answer it he can answer it he's done he can ask another
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:03:00.960]  question so that's so good my gosh higher education in this country
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:10.960]  is dead
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:26.720]  there's nothing brave about coming to a room of people and saying things that they all agree with
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:32.960]  and that they're going to snap or when it's wrong there's what you say is wrong you don't know
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.840]  everybody's experiences here you don't so how can you teach a class that is a prereq
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.160]  for some people to graduate that is a requirement for some people to graduate that they are
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:47.440]  subjected to taking and you say such hateful ass stuff is that of course the reason is that's
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:54.160]  part of the propaganda this is part of the indoctrination i'm not oppressed i'm that is our
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:59.840]  higher education system but there are people in this campus who are that he's putting into a box
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:06.080]  and that's not appropriate i have not thought of this i have not thought of these people i strongly
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:13.360]  suggest you talk to them about whether now think about this folks this is actually the real dire
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:20.400]  straights that higher education is in my god you almost need to shut down these universities at
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:25.120]  this point i mean this is out of control think about it though a class of people look most of
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.880]  students in that class probably 50 percent or more they probably have no idea they are clueless
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:34.480]  anything going on they're just in there to go to college get the grade and get out but ideologically
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:39.600]  that that individual andrew laurence is about to join us probably a few in far between up there
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:45.040]  but see the professor goes against his opinion the brainwash minions goes against an opinion
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:50.160]  so he's just out there a man on an island what's he's supposed to do how's he's supposed to graduate
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.600]  how he's supposed to share his idea how he's supposed to expand his mind he's not he's not welcome
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:02.560]  our grandparents and great grandparents know they can't food during the falls they have it during

[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:30.960]  shroyer
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.160]  ladies and gentlemen of the united states ladies and gentlemen of the entire planet
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:45.280]  this is the most important emergency transmission we've ever put out by magnitudes
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:54.080]  at one o'clock central today i will lay out the confirmed plan that we have discovered
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:59.360]  and and and have personally been targeted by by rogue criminal elements in the u.s government
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:05.920]  working with multinationals to overthrow the 2016 election and arrest president trump and
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:12.400]  vice president pence declaring that they're involved in espionage for the russians with no
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:18.560]  proof they have to do that with this type of impeachment because if they don't pencil still
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:26.000]  begin it has to be foreign meddling false election once that's done nancy polosi under the constitution
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.880]  will be the new president she can appoint her vice president and you bet you know who that is
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:37.120]  hillary rotham clinton this is the plan now in the last year robert moeller has tried to set me up
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:46.080]  and it is a blaring we have the evidence but this latest action via contacts from
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:51.920]  washington post and others we've confirmed by researching with other sources that they are
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:08:01.680]  preparing to attempt to take down info wars arrest myself and my father as well as roger stone
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:07.680]  that's why they've been moving so hard to demonize my name and lie about me and shut us off the year
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:15.840]  and to get us silent so they can then frame us so all of us are in this together this is america's
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:22.080]  darkest hour we're fighting for our very existence the president means well and works hard and has
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:29.760]  good ideas and policies but he's absolutely surrounded by traitors in the s-men herles is right
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:35.680]  he doesn't know what he's doing in general when it comes to who he appoints and who he brings in
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:41.760]  evidence by this new attorney general nominee that the deep state is licking his lips over
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:48.480]  him so they are making their move in the president and we have to get the word out about this
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:56.480]  criminal conspiracy by a rogue group of globalists working with criminals in our own government
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:01.440]  in an act of coup not just against trump but against america and the republic itself
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:07.360]  if they're able to do this this country will never re-emerge from this tyranny in my view
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:11.840]  it'll be very very hard the chips are down here ladies and gentlemen but we have truth on our side
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:16.960]  and we're still on the air at this critical point but they need to get us off the year before they
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:22.720]  make the move on trump and on pence before they install president nancy polosian vice president
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:26.720]  hillary vodam clinton they've got the women all fired up with all the tv shows and movies
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.840]  about woman power against men that was already their plan when hillary got in to have a culture war
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.160]  now they're going ahead with that blueprint and they're going to install these women
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:43.680]  in via fraudulent coup by the rogue fbi pray to god that the people's eyes be open and call everyone
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:49.680]  you know text message them email go out there and say this is it they're moving on alex jones
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:55.680]  they're moving on his father they're moving on roger stone they're moving on myself they're
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:01.280]  moving on my father they're moving against you they're moving against the free press and they're
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.600]  targeting real americans that stand up for the country they're claiming that we are foreign
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:10.560]  enemies when they themselves are literally in bed with the chai comms the russians anybody else
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:15.920]  will pay them you know i've called moeller russian agent for tar max uranium that's not really what
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:22.160]  he is he's a temp that sells out america to any foreign better he can he's a thug gangster
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:28.560]  from his days with whitey bulger and if america doesn't stand up against these monsters there's
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:35.760]  no coming back one o'clock today coming up i'm gonna lay it all out emergency transmission you
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:43.600]  are the modern paul reveres please join us in one hour so there you have it ladies and gentlemen
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:49.360]  we will be joined by alex jones in under an hour now to break this all down
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:11:00.000]  what else is there to say folks what else is there to say you are witnessing a direct coup
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:09.040]  against the president of the united states you are looking at a direct coup against the republic
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.320]  you are looking at a direct coup against free speech it's all happening right now
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:20.320]  and on the other side of this is total tyranny and the end of america and if you don't understand
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:30.400]  that you don't understand anything and we're joined now by andrew lorence which this all ties
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:37.120]  together actually andrew part of the reason why they're able to demonize alex jones and demonize
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:45.680]  trump is because of the indoctrination we see at a university level now i feel like my generation
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:52.800]  of millennials was specifically my age of 29 i feel like i was right on the edge of still kind
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:59.840]  of being like a 90s baby and not having the full 100 percent indoctrination in the schools and in
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:04.560]  the median everywhere it was like 60 70 with us depends where you look you know we still played
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:09.360]  on bicycles and actually went to the park not on social media you know if you wanted to find out
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:13.440]  what people were doing you you rode your bike around the neighborhood see where all the bikes
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:17.760]  were not getting on social media see where people are you know tagged in or whatever uh
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:23.440]  so i honestly i can't even imagine what it's like for you being on a college campus like this i mean
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.880]  i wasn't really politically inclined when i was at the university but i was always a contrarian
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.440]  and so i would get in political discussions and all kinds of discussions and it was always well
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:36.160]  you know fun and mannered nobody hated you you know you didn't have everybody including the professor
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:41.040]  ganging up against you but it seems like that's what it is to be a conservative at college campuses
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:47.280]  these days so we'll get into this more on the other side in detail about your viral video standing
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.280]  up to this racist professor but just in general here in this in this two and a half minutes we
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:58.720]  have till break what is it like being a conservative on campus these days is it really as bad as it
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:06.320]  seems to those on the outside looking in absolutely you know there is a movement on
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:14.080]  college campuses across the country for students to buy into this narrative that we constantly
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:21.440]  have to apologize for oppression that happened hundreds of years ago that we have to now accept
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:29.760]  new ideas and relearn things that are basic knowledge that we've learned about gender about
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:36.560]  sex about roles and masculinity and and this group speak on college campuses and university
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:42.960]  campuses when when you go up against that and you challenge the establishment on these campuses
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:49.520]  you're isolated you're ostracized you're criticized and it's it's unsafe sometimes for these students
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:56.000]  to to go up against these individuals who are pushing for you to buy into these ideas well and
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.840]  I look at this and I say what's the point of you even going to college now I mean what's the point
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:04.240]  you're not allowed to have your ideas you're not allowed to speak freely if you do and then your
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.640]  professor learns about your political beliefs he'll fail you or she'll fail you so I'm looking to say
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:13.920]  like what's the point of a conservative even going to college anymore they're not welcome well you
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:21.280]  know there is a certain irony to me when universities constantly are putting in initiatives to create
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:26.560]  more diversity on campuses they want everyone to look different but they want everyone to think
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:31.520]  the same way and if you don't think the way that the majority of students on campus think
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:38.640]  then you open yourself up to lots of criticism well that's very well said and I remember again
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:44.960]  I I I try to apply my experience with things to to try to get a better picture when I when I talk
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:50.880]  about stuff like this I remember I mean I had I studied psychology and media and I remember I had a
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:57.280]  a cross-cultural psych a cross-cultural psychology professor who was definitely a liberal I mean I
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:03.120]  knew he's liberal because I talked to him outside a class but in class when he was teaching you
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:08.800]  would know it he just taught you the class and he made sure that he did not inject his politics into
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.280]  it same with history classes I took I remember I got real close to a history professor she was one
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:19.040]  of the most amazing professors ever Dr. McVicker and she was a total conservative you would never
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:24.560]  know it being in her class she taught the class it seems like professors now have this this urge
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:31.360]  or or maybe it's like this comfort to politicize their class now they do you know I have a certain
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:37.920]  respect for professors on campuses that present information in an objective way and allow students
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:42.800]  to decide for themselves what it is that they believe and what they don't believe and that's
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.720]  not what we're seeing on college campuses right now there's a lot of subjective information being
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:52.240]  presented to students yeah it's not a rape culture on college campus it's a leftist liberal progressive
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:55.520]  bullying culture that's what it is we'll be right back with Andrew Lawrence don't go anywhere

[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:12.240]  the university of georgia and you've seen probably the video of either his racist professor you know
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:16.800]  talking about how bad white people are time to start killing white people or perhaps the video of
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:22.560]  him confronting his professor where he's a man on an island and you know it's all about you know
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:26.720]  being a progressive liberal in the university that's how you get an a if you're a thinking man
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:30.720]  you get an f and you get kicked out it makes you wonder what the point of a university is anymore
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:35.520]  but andrew let's actually talk about this professor uh what the class was like and what
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:42.400]  motivated you to stand up like that and record the video so at the time that the video was
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:47.680]  was recorded which was actually back in september uh i was a student journalist at the
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:54.080]  university of georgia and i had written several stories about this ta before who happened to
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:24:00.400]  have been teaching several solo courses in the philosophy department um he gave me plenty of
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:07.440]  material uh there there's years worth of tweets and facebook statuses where he has criticized
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.880]  white people um he has called white people terrorists he's compared white people to
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:19.360]  children living with autism he has uh said that we were sociopaths and more recently
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:25.600]  he made some comments about white people possibly needing to die to to make things more equal in
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:32.720]  the black community so during the time that i was i was covering this professor he had been
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:39.200]  invited to a young democrats meeting on campus at the university of georgia and i decided to
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:44.080]  attend the meeting and listen to what he had to say and then during the q and a portion i would
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:50.560]  ask him some questions about how he could possibly you know advocate for equality and
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:58.160]  write some on groups but say something so inflammatory about the white community how
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:04.800]  can you isolate one community but advocate for equality uh so i went to the meeting i waited
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:11.600]  until the q and a session no one had a question but me i raised my hand and i began to read a
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:17.600]  reference several of his tweets before i could even get through the first or second i was interrupted
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:25.600]  insulted people were yelling at me i couldn't ask my question it was a very frustrating experience
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:32.480]  and at that time i just pulled out my phone and i started recording i felt like i was seeing firsthand
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:38.080]  so many of the things i had seen on twitter and on facebook and on fox news and you know
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:43.280]  of students trying to take a stand against this type of rhetoric and being met with pushback from
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:50.320]  their peers and from someone who is paid by the university so i started recording and the rest i
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:56.400]  guess this i guess is kind of history he insulted me several different times he he told me to shut
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:03.600]  my app when i was continuing to ask my question he went on and said something to the effect of
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:09.040]  people who are born in the south and raised with manners use manners as a way of sustaining
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:15.520]  oppression i mean just really off the wall in articulate statements i really couldn't follow
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:22.800]  a lot of what he was saying and you know it was it was a very frustrating experience well
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:28.720]  i've been to sec country i mean let's call it sec country i've been to georgia you know i've
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:34.480]  been around people like this where does he get this idea i mean people in the southern bible
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:39.360]  belt are mostly conservative i mean you look at georgia's voting base i mean that's a very
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:46.160]  conservative uh red state i mean so i'm just confused where is he even getting these ideas uh
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:52.080]  southern culture to me is very conservative and and it doesn't matter what color your skin is
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:56.560]  people do like manners down there they do shake your hand they do look in the eye i mean where
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:02.080]  is he let me guess this guy's probably not even from the south am i wrong he's not from the south
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:07.680]  he was raised in california and it is undergraduate work at uc berkeley yeah exactly that's what i'm
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:14.400]  saying you go to athens georgia you go to tuscaloosa alabama you go to kennesaw you go to these areas
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:19.920]  this i mean this is the bible belt this is sec country very conservative people and it's not
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:24.000]  even necessarily politically conservative just like like manners this guy's so let me guess this
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.880]  guy from california probably never has said thank you never shook someone's hand just probably some
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:34.480]  grublet from the west coast goes down to georgia where people shake your hand where people tuck
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:39.200]  their shirt in where people comb their hair well where people take a shower and and and he's just
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:45.120]  like oh my gosh this is oppressing to me i want to look like a slovenly bum and so he considers it
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:49.600]  oppression because he's now in a culture where people actually like to comb their hair and
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:54.080]  have a nice shirt and shake people's hands and smile and say thank you ma'am so it was like
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:58.240]  an actual culture that's like uplifting and loving is what was what upset him
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:05.360]  yeah it definitely seems that way he made several posts on facebook that said that every rural
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:10.800]  community in georgia raises white supremacists that the public school systems in georgia raise
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:17.200]  white supremacists and what is the most startling is that the university has seemed to to support
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:22.160]  this rhetoric they put out two statements yesterday one over twitter and one that was emailed to me
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:28.160]  from the equal opportunity office where they said that they're not going to hold him accountable
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.960]  for these statements because they were supposedly made on a prior on a private forum i didn't know
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:38.880]  twitter was a private forum or facebook oh but but you know that same principle would apply
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:45.120]  if a conservative professor went on the internet on a private platform and was talking positively
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:50.080]  about trump or or let's even go down the the the negative road here if they were talking
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:54.800]  actual racist stuff against black people they'd be kicked out and fired immediately so it's just
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:59.280]  a total double standard we'll be right back know someone with a drinking or drug problem

[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:31.040]  show and now your host oan treuer so there's an interesting dynamic here that i want to discuss
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:36.960]  with my guest andrew lorence recently graduated from the university of georgia studying political
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:44.640]  science and he's recently gotten some fame and popularity for standing up to a racist leftist
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:49.760]  professor uh in a video that went viral of course this professor has tons of videos on the internet
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:54.800]  and posts where he's talking about anti uh white garbage and that's fine i mean look that's the i mean
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:00.960]  i don't care this this professor can be as racist as he wants uh but let's at least have a one standard
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:07.040]  policy here for racism in america and uh you know let's apply the same rules to him that we would
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:11.680]  a white professor that would say negative things about black people if that was even happening
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:18.080]  i i'm not seeing those videos but here's the here's the dynamic that is going through my head with
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:26.080]  this andrew because i have a lot of young people that ask me for advice as far as specifically
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:33.440]  people getting out of high school and uh i kind of used to go with this with the same notion which
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:38.880]  was look if you know what you want to do and you're sure about it and quite frankly if your
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:43.200]  parents are going to pay for it then go into a university probably probably probably the best
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:49.280]  bet for you if you're not sure and but you do want to go to a university you know maybe go to a
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:53.280]  a junior college or something for for a year or two until you kind of figure it out and that'll
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:59.280]  be a little easier on your wallet a little easier for you to figure out what you want to do uh so
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:03.440]  so so that's kind of what i said or or i said look you know if you already know what you want to
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:07.040]  do and you have an outlet for that and a passion and a motivation just don't even go to college
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:11.520]  quite frankly because most of these degrees you're going to get uh you either won't need it it'll
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:15.600]  just be a resume builder unless you're like an engineer or a doctor but there's a new dynamic
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:21.040]  that i think is is playing out at the university level now andrew and that's this
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:29.280]  this i look at the university now and i i almost i almost can't even tell young young students to go
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:35.600]  to college anymore i don't even think i can say that with with unless again unless your parents
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:39.040]  want to pay for it you already got it all figured out you want to be an engineer doctor uh then fine
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:44.320]  other than that i just don't see a college education benefiting people very much anymore
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:50.640]  it's a resume builder but is it really worth 60 70 80 grand whatever you pay for it but there's a new
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:56.800]  almost level to this where and i don't even know how to approach this andrew i want to
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:02.640]  know what you think about this it's almost as if because if you want to fight the war that's
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:06.880]  happening it at the college level right now if you want to fight the indoctrination that's
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:12.080]  happening at universities right now well what are you going to do if you're not on the inside so
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:18.400]  it's almost like you now have to you now have to go to a university if you're if you're a conservative
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:24.720]  you don't have to pay to get into a university just to battle the leftist indoctrination it's
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:28.720]  like you can't even go in with the mindset of i'm going to get straight a's i'm going to be a good
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:32.960]  student i'm going to actually be engaged here at this university because you won't get anything
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:38.320]  you'll get f's you'll get kicked out of class you'll be publicly you know you'll be called toxic
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:44.240]  and everything in between so it's like do you go to college now do you foot that bill to go to
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:50.640]  college just to battle these people intellectually just to go into the arena as some form of resistance
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:55.520]  or do you just say we just have to put the university behind us we just have to put the
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:37:00.560]  college stuff behind us it's gone it's gone the leftists have destroyed it what do you think
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:07.520]  we should do with this so i'm gonna start off by saying i really do value the education that i
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:11.360]  got at the university of georgia i wouldn't have spent some of the best years of my life at that
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:18.480]  university if i didn't love it so much but one thing that i've always said is that we have to stop
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:24.480]  lying to kids and telling them that it's necessary to go to a four-year university it is absolutely
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:30.080]  not necessary for everybody to go to college it's it's simply not i have friends and family members
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:37.840]  who work in various trades some are cosmetologists some are welders that have gone to trade school
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:42.960]  or gone to some sort of vocational school and they make better money than some of the people coming
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:49.520]  out of these prestigious quote quote on quote prestigious universities i think that we need
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:55.440]  to start directing kids in the direction of vocational schools and telling them that hey it's
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:38:00.560]  okay if you don't want to go to a liberal arts school if you want to go and learn a trade in two
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:05.920]  years and make double what the kids who do go to liberal arts schools are making i think that that's
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:10.800]  something that we really need to reassess in our educational system because right now telling kids
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:15.680]  that they have to go to a four-year university is subjecting them to this hateful rhetoric that
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:21.920]  we're seeing in some of our universities and colleges yeah and i could see you know at one level
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:27.680]  well it takes time for the college university structure and set up to catch up with the rest
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:32.480]  of society um what i'm talking about here is i forget what it was there was something i wanted
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:38.640]  to learn and i remember it was a specific class in college and then i realized i can go online
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:44.960]  and learn all of it in a week and and actually have it applied to something practically within a week
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:49.520]  something i would spend it probably a fifteen hundred dollar course or more at a local university
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:54.560]  it takes six months or whatever to do it so so there's kind of that aspect of college where it
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:59.760]  kind of needs to catch up to to the ability of the internet everything which takes time and and
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:06.480]  patience and and maybe that comes along but it's the end it's the level of indoctrination to me
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:12.640]  that's the real problem here i mean yes you don't necessarily need a college degree again
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:16.560]  depending on what you want to study what you want to do and just the individual their their
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:23.120]  their situation financially and all that stuff but i mean for a lot of people like learning a foreign
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:27.840]  language you can learn a foreign language there's a dozen apps i can download for free on my phone
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:32.800]  and i i'm more effective learning a foreign language probably there than spending you know
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:38.400]  a couple thousand dollars in a classroom so i mean what do you see i mean you you just you
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:44.640]  graduated recently i mean how how does the university maintain a competitive ability
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:52.240]  to educate people with the internet you know the university systems throughout the country
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:57.840]  do a very good job of marketing themselves and marketing themselves to students or prospective
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:04.400]  students in a way that is far more appealing than how vocational schools will will market
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:09.600]  themselves okay you got the big football team you know the big tailgates and everything yeah
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:16.000]  yeah i so i started at a university in georgia uh for my first few years that did not have a
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:22.320]  football team uh that really didn't have a lot going on and had like a fraction of the student
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:28.160]  body population that the university of georgia had after i transferred um you know there were not
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:33.200]  a lot of incentives to really go to a smaller university or to go to a vocational school
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.680]  other than the fact that you know you might get out a little bit earlier you could take
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:44.960]  more classes or um your your learning is tailored to a much smaller class size uh but the university
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:49.760]  of georgia and universities like it appeal to students because they want that college experience
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:54.480]  where people go in and you know they go to a football game on saturdays and they have home
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:41:03.120]  coming and uh you know they do quintessential college things um and and they spend you know
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:07.760]  eighty thousand dollars getting a degree that they won't be able to find a job with after you know
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:13.200]  underwater basket weaving is is a hard career to go into well and i think that what you're
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:18.400]  talking about is actually touching on the answer to my question which is what makes college worth it
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:23.600]  you know if the education is lacking or whatever well you kind of make your own education to some
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.000]  extent in college but you know there is a college experience there's a camaraderie there's there's
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.360]  connections you'll make that could potentially you know be career advancement or or you know options
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:40.800]  for you but the big one was to me being in a classroom setting with other thinking minds other
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:45.920]  learning minds in a professor where you exchange ideas challenged ideas challenge one another
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:50.720]  and everybody kind of grew together but you don't have that aspect anymore it's like you said it's
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:55.680]  everybody has to think one way and now you have these these professors that are for some reason so
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:02.160]  empowered they feel that they can indoctrinate their class almost like it's their job absolutely
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:07.440]  uh you know i don't really understand in this particular scenario that we have uh with this
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:14.880]  ta at the university of georgia why the university is holding on to him um he is a phd candidate that
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:20.720]  just happens to be a ta and teaches a solo course he's he's not a professor with tenure um so i don't
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:26.320]  really understand why the university is trying to hold on to him because it seems from this video
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:30.640]  well is anyone else is anyone else standing up against this are you the only one voicing concern
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:36.640]  over this guy i seem to be the only one well i think you just answered your own question right
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:42.160]  there andrew and isn't that the problem with this country people aren't willing to stand up for what's
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:48.000]  right but of course why is that because they'll label you a toxic maskey linus they'll label you
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:53.200]  a white supremacist this is how they bully people out of sharing their opinion or even telling the

[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:19.200]  in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:23.680]  but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:29.680]  deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:34.480]  to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:39.680]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:45.680]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:51.920]  charges it and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it

[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:23.440]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:30.000]  and now your host owin shroyer you know i'm sitting here in the break and kind of reminiscing on
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.840]  some of my college days i mean my god college was like always kind of out of control at a certain
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:43.440]  level but like it just all seems to be deteriorating it just all just seems to be deteriorating at all
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:51.360]  levels i mean it's just it's just so ridiculous man oh and so here's the question because i i'm
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:55.920]  a guy that wants solutions i don't claim to have all the solutions i try to use logic and reasoning
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:01.360]  to maybe find options for solutions but again i'm going to ask andrew this and let's try to let's
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:12.480]  try to really focus on this andrew what can we do as americans to try to save higher education
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:20.960]  in this country because again to me doing what you did is one level of this and i think probably the
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:26.800]  easiest way to go about this which is just standing up to these bullies in class voicing your opinion
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:31.520]  not being intimidated and then the viral video to kind of expose the whole thing to the rest of
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:36.160]  the nation and then you hope it kind of catches on as a as a trend who knows maybe you get a hashtag
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:44.800]  but that's but then it comes down to this it's like so are we now simply sending our our kids are
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:51.040]  we just sending people into universities to basically engage in intellectual warfare because
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:57.680]  you know if you go to these classes and you're a a conservative or a trump supporter that wants
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:02.640]  to voice their opinion you'll be shut down you'll be scolded the professor won't give you a fair
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:07.840]  a fair grade i mean these stories are out there folks so so it's like what do you think what do
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:11.760]  you think the answer is to this riddle how do we solve this do we just have to say all right
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:16.240]  we're sending our conservative kids to these universities and who knows what the outcome
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:19.440]  is going to be but they're going to go into these classrooms they're going to stand up for what they
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:22.560]  believe in they're going to stand up for the truth they're not going to be bullied and intimidated
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:28.640]  by the the leftist indoctrination or do you just say okay we're not sending our kids to these
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:33.040]  universities anymore we're just done with the college system or is there something else i mean
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:38.880]  what do you think is a solution here andrew well i think it there's there's two parts to it one of
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:43.280]  them that you mentioned earlier was that you know the public is just going to have to start standing
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:48.640]  behind students who who call this out and i think the second part of it is something that we really
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:54.720]  haven't discussed and that's the boosters and supporters and donors who make significant financial
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:59.040]  contributions to these schools and many many times their children and their grandchildren go
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:03.440]  to these schools they're going to have to stand up to these universities and say we are not giving
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:10.320]  you another dime until something changes on this campus because right now these universities are
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:17.600]  functioning as you know as is and the climate there is crumbling the the prestigious you know
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:23.920]  reputation that these universities have they're crumbling at the hands of inarticulate you know
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:29.920]  you know radical professors and ta is like the guy in this video well that's another issue is just
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:35.600]  the the bumbling fools that these these universities hire as professors i mean i i could talk about
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:38.800]  that i almost don't even want to get into that it looks like it may be worse than it ever was
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:43.440]  uh i mean seriously that's like that's like insane i mean some of these professors are
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:49.040]  just bumbling idiots you know they try to if you listen if you listen to this ta i mean
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:56.320]  and try and really soak up what he's saying he's talking in circles he's rambling it's hard to
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:02.800]  just look at him he's a disheveled bum professors used to show up in in suits and ties and bow ties
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:06.960]  because they wanted to look nice so that the students looked up to him this guy shows up like
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:15.680]  he just rolled out of bed probably smells like it too yeah yeah the imagery of being an educator
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:21.120]  in a college or university has definitely changed i've seen professors wear pajamas to class before
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:27.200]  i mean what the heck happened down there in the south man i don't know well we have professors
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:31.040]  like this who are permeating our universities that weren't born and raised in the south they
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:36.880]  don't understand our way of life and uh who don't really understand you know the values that many
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:42.640]  students and their families hold near and dear you know you actually are so smart i'm really
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:47.040]  impressed because you said something that was actually that was so spot-on and i and i already
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:53.040]  knew this but but saying it it refreshed in my mind one of the first viral videos exposing
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:58.640]  the status of college campuses came from from the university i went to university of missouri
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:04.080]  colombia it's known as missou where you had the professor yelling about you know your opinions
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:07.520]  not welcome here get out of here no free speech the students just filming it's an asian student
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:14.000]  from wefster uh missouri where i grew up and and so it became a whole thing there was the movement
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:19.200]  with that that that that young black kid whose father was a multi-millionaire and he was pretending
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:23.840]  to be oppressed it turned out he was getting dropped off by like private drivers uh the whole
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:30.000]  time so the whole thing was was basically just a front but it seems to me that you know there's
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:36.560]  there's slowly trickling out more videos slowly more people are kind of realizing it but i mean i
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:42.320]  just look back again i kind of compare like when i was at the university to what i see now it just
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:47.520]  seems like it's going out of control but you hit the head you hit the nail on the head i remember
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:51.120]  when this stuff started going on at the university of missouri guys see if you can find these stories
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:56.320]  and i'm serious i want the crew to actually focus on this and find this as soon as that garbage
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:03.280]  started happening at the university of missouri boosters and funders started pulling their funds
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:08.480]  and eventually the university of missouri had to suspend that professor i i'm not sure if she
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:13.360]  ever lost her job but they had to suspend her the university president of missouri ended up
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:20.480]  getting ousted too whether that was good or bad i think is up for debate but once this stuff started
[01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:24.960]  to go viral from the university of missouri with these these these crazed leptis professors boosters
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:29.440]  started pulling their funding it started hurting missus bottom line and that's when they finally
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:34.720]  started moving against some of the professors so you're actually spot on now do you know though
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:39.040]  how do you mean maybe that's the answer here maybe someone has to reach out to the boosters here
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:45.920]  maybe that's it you get the viral videos exposing the professors and then you send them to all the
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:52.080]  boosters maybe that's the answer well what i've been telling people over the last two days since
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:57.680]  this video was posted was email the alumni association email boosters email anyone you know
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:03.120]  who makes a financial contribution to this university and tell them to reach out to the e o o reach out
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:09.280]  to the legal department the office of the president and say we will not fund this university in any
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:17.040]  way shape or form until this person is no longer in any sort of position to take academic influence
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:28.720]  over students well i think that maybe that's what we do is you motivate more people to stand up like
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:34.080]  you did and get the videos or are you know maybe maybe you don't even have to do something where
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:38.800]  you stand up like that if that's not necessarily your inclination or your nature but i think that's
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:43.840]  the key you sent because you know the whole university structure is so screwed up there's
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:49.120]  so many different issues i could talk about i mean my god the highest paid person at at almost
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:53.680]  any major university is either going to be a football coach or a basketball coach uh you
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:55:00.720]  know those programs drive the most revenue yet the students don't get any money so i mean it's
[01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:08.960]  somehow it's somehow tapping into that that that blood vessel of of straight cash that funds all
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:13.120]  these universities get some of the new uniforms gets the coaches hired i mean that's what it's
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:16.480]  really these boosters really only care about let's be perfectly honest they want the football team
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:21.440]  to win so they can go to the game and eat a bunch hot dogs and you know chips and what have you so
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:27.360]  i think that that's the answer so i mean they just pulled up the the top government the top
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:33.440]  salaries at the university of texas here in austin guess what head oh and tires the biggest
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:40.800]  salaries for any government employee in texas is the head basketball and the head football coach
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:49.600]  at ut oh my god so so again this just shows you how out of whack the entire education system is
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:52.960]  all right you want andrew we've got we've got two minutes left here i want to thank you so much
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:56.720]  for coming on uh hopefully some other people interview you apparently no one else has been
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:00.480]  interested in picking up as an interview yet i'm surprised you're very well spoken very smart
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:06.240]  uh so final final minute and a half here andrew what do you want to tell our audience uh i want
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:10.320]  to tell if there are any other students watching anyone in university right now and they see this
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:14.320]  type of thing happening they need to whip out their phone and record it you don't even have to
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:19.840]  engage like i did like you said that might not be someone's nature or their inclination but record
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:26.640]  it post it show it to someone who you know supports your beliefs uh because god knows these professors
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:32.880]  don't and some of your peers don't um and really try and get the public behind you because right now
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:38.560]  from the looks of my university the administration is not even behind you well i got to tell you
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:43.360]  you really hit the nail on the head if you hit these universities where the cash comes in that
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:48.400]  changes everything because the uh the people that run these universities they live in these
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:53.680]  they live in these huge mansions provided by the university most these universities run at a
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:58.560]  tremendous deficit too i think the university of missouri is like 300 million dollars on the state
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:04.400]  of missouri they only are able to operate with the major cash that comes in from the boosters
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:08.800]  and these boosters i have a feeling don't want to see this leftist indoctrination but maybe that's
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:14.080]  the answer maybe we find out so thank you so much andrew lorenz folks follow him on twitter at young
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:22.400]  ga gop that's at young ga georgia g o p andrew lorenz follow him on twitter and reach out to him

[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:31.040]  ways to do this i mean if you really want to trigger your professor and get a viral video

[01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:52.960]  life dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:59:52.960 --> 02:00:12.560]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with olyn shroyer ladies and gentlemen
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:22.880]  there's partisan politics there's opinion there's the left there's the right there's conservatism
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:32.400]  there's liberalism there's progressivism there's all these different boxes that we may or may not
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:37.840]  fall into politically but there's one box that we should all exist in and that's common sense
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:43.920]  that's logic that's reasoning and you'd hope that's putting america first being proud of your
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:49.840]  country being proud of your heritage now that is not the case and perhaps even up for a fair debate
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:01:00.080]  but jim jordan goes to congress yesterday and delivers a speech not partisan not republican
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:08.000]  not conservative not liberal not democrat nothing but just truth nothing but just common sense
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:16.880]  nothing but just logic nothing but just what america needs to hear here's jim jordan's speech
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:23.360]  to congress yesterday today's left has taken the most radical positions in american history
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:29.440]  they applaud cappernick when he disrespects the flag they embrace governor qualmo when he says america
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:36.160]  was never that great we're not gonna make america great again it was never that great and they cheer
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:42.160]  on maxine waters when she says go out and harass anyone who supports the president if you see anybody
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:50.560]  from that cabinet in a restaurant in a department store in a gasoline station you get out and you
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:59.600]  create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they're not welcome anymore anywhere today's
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:06.320]  left thinks that america is just another country just one of the 190 some countries on the planet
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:11.280]  united states of america is not just another country it's the greatest nation in history
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:18.080]  that has done more good for more people than any country ever a special place where people from all
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:25.440]  over the world all shapes all sizes all colors all talents come to so they can chase down their
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:31.120]  goals chase down their dreams make life better for themselves and their family that's this country
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:38.080]  a special place where people come and respect the constitution cherish the bill of rights and
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:45.680]  embrace the rule of law democrat congressman blumenauer said abolish ice secretary clinton
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:50.560]  when she was running for the highest office in the land said we need a borderless hemisphere
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:55.760]  we've learned from the wiki lakes that you said this and i want to quote my dream is a
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:02.000]  hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders i will continue speaking out for
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.840]  comprehensive immigration reform i think the people who are here deserve a path to citizenship
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:15.280]  speaker polosi said walls are immoral a wall is an immorality just last week stacey aprams governor
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:22.480]  candidate state of georgia said non-citizens should be able to vote think about that so not in some
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:28.880]  cases you would be supportive of non-citizens but i wouldn't oppose it she wouldn't oppose it she's
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:35.520]  sounds like she is open to non-citizens voting in local elections americans believe that borders
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:41.440]  need to be strong americans believe we believe that there's a difference a big difference between
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:46.320]  legal immigration and illegal immigration and americans and republicans and the house freedom
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:52.800]  caucus believe that a border security wall will help stop drug problem the gang problem and the
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:04:01.680]  human trafficking problem so there you go ladies and gentlemen and you know it's funny because
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:05.920]  people in america want to bitch and complain about stuff here and there's a lot of corruption i mean
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:13.520]  we're the first to report it but they tend to miss what america actually means what it actually
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:18.720]  represents and why it's the greatest country on earth and then they tend to ignore well they don't
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:23.520]  ignore it when it's politically advantageous for them to bring it up but they'll ignore the fact that
[02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:29.280]  pretty much people from almost every country want to try to come to this country because it's the
[02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:35.200]  best on earth if it was racist it wouldn't be that way but you know it's funny that they all
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:39.280]  complain about the status of america you know there used to be a way to measure rich and poor
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:45.280]  you know what that way was you would look at someone and if they were fat they'd be assumed rich
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:49.600]  if they were skinny they'd be assumed poor you notice how many poor people in america are fat
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:53.280]  what does that tell you about the standard living in this country
[02:04:53.280 --> 02:05:02.560]  in this country cbd rich hemp oil is totally organic all natural something god gave us
[02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:10.160]  and it doesn't have thc in it and it's totally legal in all 50 states this is where everybody's
[02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:18.320]  going this is what your body actually needs there are so many different spectrums of this
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:24.080]  natural oil that comes from hemp now legal and lawful in all 50 states that you need to just
[02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:29.680]  go research it for yourself this is not marijuana there are hundreds varieties of hemp this is

[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:05.680]  this is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of texas us resistance
[02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:10.240]  against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by communist china ally with the big
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:16.080]  mega banks that set up communist china in 1949 the communist chinese have taken control of us

[02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:28.800]  drill big tech and silicon valley is almost completely run by the communist chinese government
[02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:34.560]  they've officially become state run apple 100 google is now making the transition and announcing
[02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:40.240]  a merger and total worldwide censorship they are now beta testing using me as the straw man
[02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:44.960]  a demonized version of alex jones to do that this is happening this is not like the other probes
[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:49.280]  before that we're meant to get you used to probes and censorship thinking you would adapt the
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:54.720]  censorship by just putting up with it now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands
[02:07:54.720 --> 02:08:00.560]  of times the magnitude of all previous attacks this is a tight traded dose reverse psychological
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:07.040]  warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation and layman's
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:11.760]  terms they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed we adapt to being pressed with
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:18.480]  the low dosages of oppression now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover we try to adapt to
[02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:25.280]  the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose total internet
[02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:29.920]  of things integration global social score complete command and control system it is the
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:35.600]  virtual reality ai weapon system now attacking the united states with traders inside the major
[02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:40.720]  security agencies blocking trumps resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:45.760]  the tentacles of the chai con slash big tech begging combine emergency situation i have been
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:49.920]  chosen for destruction because i brought you this information and have been battering ramming it out
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:56.400]  as much as i can they want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:09:01.920]  deception where every angle of my good is turned against us so they take what i've said being
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:07.040]  sincere build me into an instance here person in the straw man i'm person that cares about life
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:11.360]  and children and is against these wars and so they make me a herder of children and then they
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:16.560]  build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:22.720]  make a debate about alex jones so even if i didn't sell out to them they now use me as an archetype
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:28.800]  to serve them by being the main distraction i have now been captured by the enemy in the
[02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:34.560]  information warfare fulcrum has been used against you only your full understanding of this t will
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:39.760]  break you free from this paradigm i have given you the transmission now break free
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:50.960]  i have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:59.520]  mind of man thomas jefferson if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:11.280]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:22.640]  my wife was scheduled for surgery today for the last month and so i wasn't gonna be here
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:30.400]  but i ended up staying up basically all last night because the information you're about to
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:38.080]  receive and i got her into surgery got her out and i'm here i want to thank the crew i want to
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:44.880]  thank everybody uh who makes this broadcast possible now i'm gonna try to be very reserved
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:52.000]  and very calm in the rest of the hour with roger stone and i'm gonna try to lay this information
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:58.480]  out i want to explain something to everybody we've now moved on from the two-year fake russia hoax
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:13.920]  the witch hunt we've now moved on to the final phase of the witch hunt where it goes into an
[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:20.000]  inquisition and they start persecuting everybody and overturning the 2016 election and that means
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:26.880]  putting nancy polosi in because by saying it's a foreign meddling by saying it's a foreign attack
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:33.760]  by doing this they are then able to remove the vice president as well and then you will have her
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:38.080]  as the president and whoever she wants to designate as vice president
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:48.320]  so that's why this is so incredibly important this is a lot bigger than info wars is a lot bigger than
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:55.680]  any individual person like roger stone this is the culmination the coming to a head of
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:12:01.440]  robert moeller's investigation and the word is they're going to move on him in march i got that
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:06.560]  from a lot of really intelligent high-level sources last october and i said they're going
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:13.520]  to move against him again in march and you can see it all building to a crescendo now let me
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:18.560]  make the personal announcement then we'll flush it all out go through it all here on air i have the
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:25.600]  documents this is going to be world exclusive information here for everybody i've gone to the
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:31.520]  fbi last year when obviously another arm of it the moeller operation tried to set me up that
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:37.680]  there's just cut and dry right out of a movie you wouldn't believe it then again
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:47.360]  we were basically infiltrated and we've been able from high-level sources and by using police
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:56.480]  tactics to get major news organizations to admit who their sources are and so we know exactly who
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:01.680]  is behind it we're able to cross reference it so because we've been this persecuted and this
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:06.960]  targeted and set up as the straw man for the entire fall of america and the takedown of the
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:13.760]  president and our republic itself literally we are in the eye of the hurricane and are able to see
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:19.200]  things and know things others don't that's why this is actually a blessing in fact i'm not scared
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:23.760]  of robert moeller the third i'm not scared of all these white shoe boy lawyers and want to be tough
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:29.280]  guys okay uh who cover up all the pedophilia and evil and the rest of it i i know i've been put in
[02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:37.440]  this place by god thanks for your support and prayers to now face this test in fact my entire
[02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:41.200]  life i have just been feeling like i'm not carrying out my mission and i've got to do something i'm
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:47.200]  always burning in my bones and driven and there's just been this great weight on me and for the first
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:53.600]  time in my life it's lifted it's it's it's it's it's i mean i really feel the spirit of gods with me
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:59.040]  and i i'm just i'm right where i want to be but i want to tell you all something ladies and gentlemen
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:05.920]  this spirit of fear and this spirit of bullying from the left and the deep state and the rogue
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:11.120]  state and the and the globalist is permeating this country and we have a real shortage of men
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:16.480]  i've been on the phone today with some of the most prominent and famous people in the country
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:22.240]  who are the few people that have courage to talk about this and they have said without me even saying
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:28.240]  it i'm not worried about myself in fact i have no fear i fear for our children and the country and
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:32.000]  the world and that's what you've got to step into as a man before we get to this information
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:38.160]  we'll come back from break and get into it folks need to understand something they are systematically
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:44.720]  consciously trying to create frauds like trump in a hotel being pissed on buzzfeed puts it out
[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:50.880]  it's admittedly fake now today they have co in the stool pigeon who's very low IQ a known liar saying
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:58.800]  trump told him to send a bag of cash in a boxing glove to somebody to rig a poll see oh trump rigged
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:03.920]  the election trump rigged not hillary with her admitted fake bulls and the wiki leaks
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:10.000]  not gone patexta two years before the election even started saying buy off all the pollsters
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:15.040]  so none of them will report the truth in 2016 that's two years before the election even gets
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:19.200]  going they're already buying everyone off with with polls to let them know who their
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:25.360]  big mama is and which side of the which side of the bread everything's buttered
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:33.760]  so they're making their move and literally trying to indict not just me but my father
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:42.880]  and roger stone and it's sickening to hear these abc and washington post reporters giggling and
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:48.800]  snickering about their criminal activity i mean this is a group of criminals and we will defeat
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:53.120]  these terrorists these psychological terrorists who get the global exclusive how they plan to take

[02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:45.760]  and where that came from absolutely total fiction as as as fictional as star wars or the korean
[02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:51.200]  and so that's where we now are and we know they did that
[02:22:53.360 --> 02:22:57.440]  believing that they would get us to release the stories because we don't have any other choice
[02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:04.720]  because this information is is is is is so out of control so i just want the enemy to know we
[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:09.840]  we know what you're doing you know first get us to try to not report on it and not talk about
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:15.920]  how you try to set us up then pull back create a whole new lie that will lay out in great detail
[02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:21.040]  right now but understand this when we're done doing that they're making their move we'll go a
[02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:27.040]  little bit the next hour they're they're making their move on trump in the next few months and we
[02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:35.680]  exclusively from our unparalleled perspective in the middle of the battle have intel that no one
[02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:41.600]  else has so the answer to defeating this whole thing is in our hands and i had to tell the president
[02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:48.000]  something and i'll do this at the end of this discussion first we'll talk about what's currently
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:54.000]  happening in the next level of the inquisition the political coup by the deep state what they're
[02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:58.320]  planning to do with it who they're planning to install and then what trump must do to stop it
[02:23:58.320 --> 02:24:03.040]  and if trump does not immediately act on this and i was talking to high level
[02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:11.600]  high level people today they agreed that if trump does not act that then then then it's not that he's
[02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:16.560]  our enemy but that something's wrong with him he's autistic he's very smart in some ways not
[02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:22.640]  in others uh and that you know he means well but he's not defending us he's not defending himself
[02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:26.160]  and we'll go on with nationalism and anti-globalism and fight the left but
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:31.120]  trump must be abandoned because if trump is abandoning the people defending him
[02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:34.880]  then he must be abandoned so i'm letting the president know not to get muller off my ass
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:39.280]  i'll fight him to the end he's a globalist that sold the country out but if trump doesn't understand
[02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:43.760]  the existential threat to him his family the country everything and doesn't move against
[02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:48.800]  these people when they're open criminals in an open criminal conspiracy and lets them do this then
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:54.080]  these little stunts canceling Pelosi's airplane ride okay that's all cutesy foot that's not real
[02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:58.480]  world roger i'm gonna shut up now this segment next give you the floor you're on fire we've been
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:03.680]  up all night long uh just going over everything making sure everything we is absolutely accurate
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:11.280]  and and and now know the next move Mueller's specialty Mueller's specialty targeting people's
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:16.560]  families uh and but you know my mom normally doesn't like conflict last night talking at 3 a.m
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:20.880]  she goes god's on our side i'm not worried at all it's all gonna turn out good we come from good
[02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:26.560]  people and that's we come from good people we're good people we found it america we found in texas
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:31.040]  we won the wars and you parasite's coming and take it over later so roger you've got the floor
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:35.920]  of this segment what's left of the next one get into the the current conspiracy to finally
[02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:40.960]  gin up some fake russia connection to overturn the election using you myself and my father
[02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:47.760]  yeah i think alex important people understand that this is a subplot in other words the deep
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:53.520]  staters understand that as a precursor to take down don trump which they clearly intend to do
[02:25:53.520 --> 02:26:00.720]  do they need to they need to co-opt and silence both roger stone and alex jones and of course
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:07.360]  info wars and therefore as i have told uh the info wars audience previously i've been deeply
[02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:14.480]  disappointed that dr jerry coursey who at least on paper is a patriot has been more than willing
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:20.320]  to bear false witness against me for robert muller and the grand jury claiming falsely
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:24.880]  that the information he provided to me regarding the pedestrian brothers russian dealings with
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:31.760]  some how a cover story a cover story for what is not clear because no cover story is required
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:39.600]  now uh incredibly coursey is clearly told the special counsel mr muller most likely the grand
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:45.680]  jury well let's just say it we we know we were able to confirm so he needs to know his covers
[02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:53.040]  blown but yeah continue but he's evidently claiming falsely that his employment at info wars where
[02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:59.760]  he was briefly the washington bureau chief was somehow a hush money or an inducement for him
[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:06.640]  to be silent this is completely and totally categorically false as is his claim that i knew
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:13.440]  about the billy bush tape in advance as is all of his prognostications regarding wiki leaks every
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:20.880]  one of which turned out to be false so now he is claiming that evidently some severance he got from
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:28.880]  from info wars after being terminated after a drunken meltdown in a washington dc restaurant
[02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:36.880]  constitute constituted hush money payments it's ludicrous it's ridiculous and it's false no one
[02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:43.360]  gets paid at info wars for work they didn't do so under his contract i'm told by your folks
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:49.760]  that he received some limited severance but now he's mischaracterizing that as a hush money payment
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:55.840]  hush money for what no hush money is required nobody in fours has done anything wrong i have
[02:27:55.840 --> 02:28:02.560]  did nothing wrong but anybody who doesn't understand that jerry coursey and his inept lawyer larry
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:08.720]  claimant are now playing ball with robert muller and the washington post that is trying to promulgate
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:15.280]  this pack of lies does not understand what's going on but they just heard the stone cold truth
[02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:20.720]  that's right and these light ways the washington post and abc to know we know you guys aren't
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:25.840]  off the record and neither are we okay so we okay we've got your ass and it's all being
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:30.800]  transmitted to the proper authorities though there's not many of them left most men have like
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:36.000]  gone oh gosh the deep state's moving on trump let me roll over to the chai comms and the radical

[02:34:03.040 --> 02:34:11.680]  but materialistic narcissistic self-aggrandizing worshipers who have crawled their way up the
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:20.320]  ass of the devil and think they're winners i'm a trailblazer i'm a pioneer i'm a builder and it
[02:34:20.320 --> 02:34:26.560]  doesn't mean i'm on a power trip it means i love god and i love justice and i knew roger stone
[02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:31.760]  wasn't involved with the russians i knew wiki leaks didn't come from the russians hell i've
[02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:37.040]  had the former head of the nsa in my office and in the studio and they have on record the download
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:43.920]  speeds of the wiki leaks that was downloaded in the port by a thumb drive at that time it was like
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:50.160]  five times faster the fastest online download we know what went on we know they were scared to
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:56.000]  death anybody looking at seth rich and i was here when when when still on wiki leaks was all over
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:59.920]  the news and they wouldn't give us the time of day and i was calling him hillary clinton's butt
[02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:05.840]  plug i was here when we were trying to get the big scoop what's wrong with journalists
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:11.840]  trying to get the big scoop i mean you saw juicer for 2.0 talking the new york times roger couldn't
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:18.800]  even tweet at him and say hey give me some info so we all know this is a fraud like piscay everything
[02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:35.600]  else if we have a memory but now i know for 100% not 99.999 100 platinum percent it's pure crap
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:42.720]  my father managed at one time a hundred dental officers by the end about 30 he was working
[02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:47.360]  15 hours a day he'd come home and collapse and he had heart problems and didn't even tell my mom
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:51.520]  about it because he wanted to keep her just he treats her like royalty when that's how we do
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:57.200]  in our family spoil a lot of women and i hired him seven years ago because he could be trusted to do
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:05.280]  accounting and hr and that's all he does and if anything he's too nice to everybody he's a sweetheart
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:11.440]  and you know it's next level to go after my dad it's next level to know that my dad
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:17.600]  had said the course he cried on the phone because i kept saying i'm firing him we got all the emails
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:21.920]  i'm firing him in april for this story this is a load of crap they're like oh see if it gets
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:26.960]  better or whatever and he goes oh he's our bureau chief big name here we had he didn't deliver any
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:32.720]  of it and then and i'm telling roger i'm gonna fire this guy he's a frickin kook man he used to
[02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:38.000]  be great on lewd odds everything what the hell happened to him and i'm gonna go back to roger
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:45.280]  here just you get uh just so you understand this this is the truth and he brings this colonel
[02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:50.080]  sanders guy here he tells me oh peter teal wants to invest in you know wasn't the russians it was
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:57.440]  peter teal supposedly then when they show up it's not peter teal it's uh it's colonel sanders
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:04.880]  and uh the other guy i remember saying in a minute and i call roger if it's only ever get me straight
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:09.680]  in for when he goes yeah it's a bunch of talk and so i sit there and i hear that and see so course
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:14.000]  he got pissed of course like we're gonna have a private offering and we're gonna be world wide
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:18.960]  all this all this bs i was like dude i'm not involved in that and i was like my my my alarms
[02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:26.080]  are going off and so within course he being here six seven eight months already my opinion of him
[02:37:26.080 --> 02:37:29.920]  went way down from all the 18 years i've known him with the great work he'd done in the best-selling
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:36.160]  books and everything he'd been engaged in and this is just the anatomy of what's happening here
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:42.320]  we got to get back into currently another going after trump and this big global exclusive
[02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:50.880]  it's just the idea then to be sitting here and to know what really went on and then to have the
[02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:57.600]  washington post and all these other publications sitting there saying we hear you paid coursey
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:04.000]  hush money because his contract was year to year and if it wasn't for cause then we said we'd pay
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:10.640]  out his contracts he was let go in june we said fine because he was crying begging okay you can
[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:14.160]  have six months i didn't see someone getting severed space still working here i'm like no he's
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:18.640]  longer here we didn't publish his article since june six or whatever he hadn't been on since then
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:25.840]  and then that becomes payoffs by roger stone who roger stone doesn't give the orders and i'm
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:30.240]  trying to act tough around here roger stone doesn't give the orders around here he produces news
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:35.200]  and research we just won the election we wanted to report news about america being reborn we wanted
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:40.960]  to go cover press conferences we wanted to be journalists we wanted to have guests on roger stone

[02:39:56.800 --> 02:40:03.520]  diabolical when you you sit there and you're a good wholesome person and these people manufacture
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:09.040]  this crap and they've tried to shut us down and curtail us so that when they made this move we would
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:14.000]  not even have a voice but you know what i believe in our listeners and viewers and i believe this
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:18.480]  voice will get out i believe no matter what happens to me just like colonel travis at the alamo
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:22.800]  and i'm not comparing myself to that yet but i'm cut from that you better believe it like nobody
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:28.960]  else you know nobody else you know that connected like i am and i don't brag about it i will never
[02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:33.280]  back down to goddamn pieces of filth and i mean that not in the lord's name in vain i mean you
[02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:36.640]  people are damned to hell roger we got three minutes to break we'll have the whole next segment
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:40.240]  and we got to get into we'll back up beggars we got to go to the next hour or they're planning to
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:45.120]  take out trump put in policy they admit it now it's on trump won't listen we i've got to let
[02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:51.040]  trump know just just go ahead i'm sorry i've got you and i'm running not at all alex look this is
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:56.640]  a definitively clear unfortunately in violation of the bible jerry course he's decided to bear
[02:40:56.640 --> 02:41:01.840]  false witnesses about against both you and me unfortunately his own text messages and the
[02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:07.040]  metadata tags on the various documents prove that he's lying i guess he forgot about that
[02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:12.400]  but he is he was perfectly willing to throw a fellow trump supporter a fellow conservative
[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:16.720]  over the side until they told him that he would have to plead guilty to something
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:22.320]  that he didn't do let's be very clear he never told me that anybody had stolen john pedestrian
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:28.800]  emails he never gave me any such thing therefore there is nothing to cover up in fact my famous
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:36.560]  tweet was not controversial for six weeks so cover up for what his position is irrational
[02:41:36.560 --> 02:41:42.560]  as well as ill logical and then teaming with shelby holiday of the wall street journal one
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:49.520]  of the most duplicitous dishonest two-faced liars in media today teaming up with leftists like that
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:57.040]  going on with ari melbur of msnbc to spew his lie after lie after lie i don't know how dr coursey
[02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:01.600]  sleeps with himself and then if you see what happened to michael cohen what groveling and
[02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:08.960]  giving a rim job that robert moeller does yeah look if they think that there's any chance whatsoever
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:13.440]  that they're going to destroy you and they're going to get me to testify against john trump
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:19.440]  making up stories bearing false witness that's not going to happen there's zero chance that's
[02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:23.680]  going to the worst they do step to me i mean i would never have sold out before but there's no
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:29.600]  i mean never i mean these people are the enemy hold on we got to get it i know you're going
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:36.960]  over you but the point is they are literally trying to say giving someone six-month severance pay
[02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:42.160]  is a payoff and if they all want to indict and they let me know my father and then we've got
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:45.760]  all other proof of the sting they tried to run we haven't even gotten to that so bombshell is
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:49.680]  breaking as we speak we'll be right back with roger's telling about their master plan if they
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:56.560]  take trump down in the next three months and how we can stop it it's really hard to have the energy

[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:35.280]  more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists

[02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:12.960]  you
[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:20.560]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the front
[02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:30.720]  lines of the info war let me just recap briefly foreign multinational powers are manipulating
[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:36.960]  sellout trader collaborator elements in our government hollywood the democrats cowards neocons
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:44.880]  to parlay america into a global government they believe they're building but the chinese the
[02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:50.720]  EU they're all bidding for power they haven't sold out like you have completely your fools
[02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:57.360]  that's incredibly dangerous so along comes a president who sees a business deal and who you
[02:47:57.360 --> 02:48:02.160]  know he's a scott he's got a german last name but you know i think more of the mom got into him
[02:48:02.160 --> 02:48:08.160]  and the dad and you know no scott's will turn a piece of coal in their ass into a diamond
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:12.640]  they get so so so so selfish about money nothing it's got a little bit scott in me
[02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:16.320]  so trump sees america get screwed over and goes we're super powerful and number one
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:22.080]  why should we just throw it overboard well the globalists had already sold the whole thing out
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:28.560]  and so they're like dude we already sold it you can't do this we have agreements and he said no you
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:34.480]  don't and he's smart about that we'll get this next hour not smart about how to counter it and
[02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:40.720]  so now they've built this whole russian canard to overturn not just the president but the vice
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:49.200]  president that's what this is really all about so imagine the the twilight zone insanity that at
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:57.920]  the end of this whole thing two-plus years of b.s roger stone drum coursey alex jones and dr
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:04.080]  david jones are now the center of what he wants to the next month to quote finish his fake
[02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:10.240]  investigation to begin the impeachment that's why they want to solve fair so we can't respond
[02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:15.440]  but oh you kept us on there oh you bought products oh you prayed for us oh we're still here see
[02:49:15.440 --> 02:49:22.640]  they're not all powerful but now the unstoppable force is meeting the unmovable object and that
[02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:28.720]  causes explosions i'm praying for peace ladies and gentlemen but i know that the people out there
[02:49:28.720 --> 02:49:33.840]  understand we're in a war a globalist civil war that's coming after our children our country our
[02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:39.360]  very essence and most men just want to put their finger in the wind and say well i'm going to go
[02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:43.840]  along with this because i'll be safe i'll get some more money but what is good as your money
[02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:47.840]  if the whole country goes down i want to appeal just to their basic selfishness so they don't
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:54.640]  have a soul this is not good for the average person even the average sellout so roger here we
[02:49:54.640 --> 02:50:01.440]  are quantifying this we'll get to this next hour why i am ready to denounce donald trump
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:06.160]  why i'm ready to come out against all trump and it's not to get Mueller off my ass no no no it's
[02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:10.880]  to let trump know that he's failed those of us that tell the truth he's not stood up against
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:15.280]  censorship he's not stood up when he has the power to stop it but just at the time we have in this
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:23.280]  segment the persecution the plan chillery clinton uh Pelosi i mean this this isn't our opinion
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:27.120]  listeners have you ever heard one thing i said in my life this is the biggest alert we've ever
[02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:31.600]  put out and i'm begging you to hear me there's a lot of stuff's been urgent but now we're to the point
[02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:38.560]  they're preparing the civil war they're preparing the race war the clash of the sexes you see all
[02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:43.680]  the programming hillary was supposed to be in they said hey the matter will impeach him as a russian
[02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:50.320]  when hillary throwing a fit you know on that night when trump wins will impeach him as a russian
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:57.520]  and Pelosi will be the speaker and you'll be the vice president and you'll do it together
[02:50:57.520 --> 02:51:01.200]  we'll make it all about women against men we're still going to win and that's been the plan
[02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:08.960]  that's been the program that's been the operation so you're getting from the inside right now how to
[02:51:08.960 --> 02:51:16.560]  stop them and what they're doing because if they remove trump for foreign collusion and made up
[02:51:16.560 --> 02:51:23.600]  russian connections they get pinched too roger explain to the viewers how this is for all the
[02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:30.480]  marbles absolutely alex well notice what's happened in the last several days where the
[02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:36.320]  mainstream media and their corporate controlled media has gone into high gear repeating the
[02:51:36.320 --> 02:51:42.240]  big lie now over and over again trump works for putin trump is a russian asset trump is a russian
[02:51:42.240 --> 02:51:48.400]  trader we're no longer in a in a in a realm where you need corroboration or proof or evidence now
[02:51:48.400 --> 02:51:52.880]  they they want us to believe that just because andrikes and cooper says something or chris
[02:51:52.880 --> 02:51:58.240]  quomo says something or ari melbert says something or the new york times or the washington most
[02:51:58.240 --> 02:52:03.840]  says i mean it's true it's true because they say it that's why they don't want to proceed against
[02:52:03.840 --> 02:52:08.960]  trump on the basis of his tax returns or his business dealings because that would leave
[02:52:08.960 --> 02:52:14.640]  mike pence as president and although i'm not a great lover of mike pence uh it that's not
[02:52:14.640 --> 02:52:22.000]  their plan their plan is very very clear hook up some fraudulent charge of russian collusion
[02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:26.880]  between the trump campaign and the russian state to win the election that gives them the grounds
[02:52:26.880 --> 02:52:33.520]  to remove both donald trump and mike pence that constitutionally means nancy polosi would be elevated
[02:52:33.520 --> 02:52:39.280]  to the presidency but the vice presidency would be vacant she would then appoint hillary clinton
[02:52:39.280 --> 02:52:45.360]  to the vice presidency then polosi would resign i'm imagining she will try and maneuver to stay
[02:52:45.360 --> 02:52:50.960]  as speaker of the house uh and hillary clinton would get that thing which she was not able to get
[02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:57.520]  in 2016 the white house that is the plan that you've just heard it you're going to hear it again but
[02:52:57.520 --> 02:53:02.480]  that is where this is all going and i'll say i was frightening roger everything you said here
[02:53:03.760 --> 02:53:06.720]  you're one of those you're probably the most true person i've ever talked to they say are
[02:53:06.720 --> 02:53:10.480]  these dirty tricks are all this and you kind of like reveled in it but it's not true everything
[02:53:10.480 --> 02:53:15.040]  you basically said has come true and you've never steered me wrong you've got uncanny
[02:53:15.760 --> 02:53:19.200]  instinct and incredible memory i hope when i'm your age i still have that
[02:53:19.200 --> 02:53:23.920]  face having memory better than yours but i mean you're older than i am and this is it this we're
[02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:30.080]  not just saying this this is the law this is what they're saying they've begun impeachment it's here
[02:53:30.080 --> 02:53:35.760]  and they plan as you said a subplot to prove but the subplot is the plot that we're these russians
[02:53:35.760 --> 02:53:42.720]  finally with corsie and then they've got the whole thing they bring down the president and the vice
[02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:49.040]  president this is a national emergency well and i think people need to understand alex they need to
[02:53:49.040 --> 02:53:55.760]  get you and i out of the way the subplot that jerry corsie is now complicit in bearing false
[02:53:55.760 --> 02:54:02.320]  witness against us making up nonsense is to get us off the board they seek to destroy me financially
[02:54:02.320 --> 02:54:08.080]  do i ask people to go to stonedefensefund.com because they're destroying me i lost my health
[02:54:08.080 --> 02:54:13.760]  and life insurance in december this is part of the plan to squeeze me to get me to testify against
[02:54:13.760 --> 02:54:19.840]  no no here people should support you and what they've done info wars in an effort to silence you
[02:54:19.840 --> 02:54:25.600]  and to cut off our revenues is because they recognize that info wars is the early warning
[02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:31.520]  system for the coming impeachment that's why they have to destroy the two of us and they don't
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:37.680]  understand our character you see they think that we're like them that we're in this for money or
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:43.040]  status or aggrandizement they don't understand that we're in this for the country i didn't get
[02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:47.360]  into politics because i wanted to be a big shot if i wanted to be a big shot i would have kissed
[02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:53.920]  george bush's ass i had plenty of opportunity jim baker begged me to run george hw bush's
[02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:59.360]  presidential campaign but i didn't believe in him and i didn't believe in the deep state i believe
[02:54:59.360 --> 02:55:04.560]  i get into politics because of berry goldwater because i stood for some i may have my own style
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:09.680]  but there's no question i'm not in this for the money if i were i'd be wealthy today and i am not
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:15.520]  wealthy today but they seek to destroy me just like they seek to destroy you and info wars and
[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:21.680]  what they don't understand is we have the president's back but he needs to have our back and we'll
[02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:27.200]  talk about that next segment because and i'm i'm taking trump the the tool shed i'm very proud

[02:55:30.960 --> 02:55:35.600]  a syrian he didn't we're very proud of him ran paul is but i've talked to a lot of hollible folks
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:40.560]  connected to the president in the white house just today i've talked to five different people and
[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:46.080]  they say he's super smart at instincts and politics he loves america but he is dumber

[03:00:21.520 --> 03:00:26.560]  i've said this many times it's the truth i've been on here 25 years almost 25 years and
[03:00:26.560 --> 03:00:31.440]  these two maybe once a year i'd say this is the most important broadcast i've ever done
[03:00:31.440 --> 03:00:35.280]  so you're going through live things you'll get more important towards this singularity
[03:00:36.080 --> 03:00:40.160]  the last few years i've been saying it like every month and every week but there's hands down
[03:00:40.160 --> 03:00:45.600]  right now i've still despite the fact we're censored and attacked and blocked in many areas
[03:00:45.600 --> 03:00:49.680]  we're still reaching millions of people thanks to you and i'll just say like thanks to you i mean
[03:00:49.680 --> 03:00:52.720]  like thanks like you're pulling me out of the north atlantic ocean when i'm freezing to death
[03:00:53.280 --> 03:00:59.120]  or i'm on fire you're putting a blanket over me i mean words can't describe that
[03:01:00.240 --> 03:01:06.800]  and we're here now and this is real and this is so historical next segment because some
[03:01:06.800 --> 03:01:11.120]  stations don't care this segment we're going to get into what trump needs to do how they plan to
[03:01:11.120 --> 03:01:18.640]  take him out hands down most important segment will ever do up to this point and they fear you
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:23.920]  they fear you grabbing the video once we post it info wars dot com our emergency message is
[03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:30.080]  trump alex jones prepares to turn against trump because he's turning against himself he's not
[03:01:30.080 --> 03:01:34.160]  facing the real danger he's being lied to by a coterie of people around him and fox news is
[03:01:34.160 --> 03:01:39.040]  just bubble we're going to talk about this next segment that's why they want to shut down when
[03:01:39.040 --> 03:01:43.920]  they make their move on trump and on america they don't want us on air so our attack on trump is a
[03:01:43.920 --> 03:01:47.600]  loving attack that's going to happen but roger let's get into the anatomy of this to understand
[03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:52.880]  the larger enemy structure why did they pick you two years ago to frame the whole wiki leaks thing
[03:01:52.880 --> 03:01:57.280]  to change the subject from hillary and then obviously to try to take me down now suck us in
[03:01:58.320 --> 03:02:03.760]  where do you think that's going well i also think it's abundantly clear because i was a
[03:02:03.760 --> 03:02:08.880]  an aide to president richard nixon is a very young man because i lived through watergate i've seen
[03:02:08.880 --> 03:02:14.800]  this movie in all honesty i may be the one person on the face of the planet who could tell the president
[03:02:14.800 --> 03:02:21.520]  how to navigate through these waters and how to use the power he has let's be clear he is a pure
[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:27.120]  heart his instincts are good in some cases i don't know whether he issues orders in his orders are
[03:02:27.120 --> 03:02:34.960]  ignored by the coterie of deep staters that he has surrounded we've seen it in the books where
[03:02:35.600 --> 03:02:40.720]  they steal documents from his desk he asks for documents to sign to issue executive orders
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:46.480]  and they they they stall they hide them they hope that he'll forget he's trying to run the country
[03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:51.920]  he's trying to beat back the chai comms he's trying to negotiate new business deals for the
[03:02:51.920 --> 03:02:57.600]  country new trade deals i should say he's trying to seal our border he's trying to reinvigorate
[03:02:57.600 --> 03:03:04.400]  the economy he's got a few things on his mind but sadly his tweets are great but tweets must be
[03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:11.040]  backed up with action so don't just tweet about internet censorship of your allies order your
[03:03:11.040 --> 03:03:15.680]  justice for a department we're going to do that in our message next segment this now though is
[03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:21.440]  you just said it it's true you're kind of the ghost of richard nixon he wasn't perfect was pro
[03:03:21.440 --> 03:03:27.760]  america the deep state tried to remove him to capture the presidency and then make it all powerful
[03:03:27.760 --> 03:03:33.760]  because the oligarchy controlled it trump represents the recapturing that reagan tried and then i
[03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:38.000]  think trumps partially done so i think that's it they fear you because you are the ghost of
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:42.880]  richard nixon and reportedly one of his best friends in his last years i know exactly what the
[03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:48.080]  president needs to do right now to save himself but i am confounded knowing the man for 40 years
[03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:54.240]  having deep affection for him and his parents and his family and the man himself i'm perplexed
[03:03:54.240 --> 03:03:59.920]  as to why he will not use the power he has to be clear you and i and all of us are bound
[03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:05.120]  where i'm ready to die i don't want to die i love life but whatever what do we got to do here i mean
[03:04:05.120 --> 03:04:10.160]  i'm committed because these people are bad so somebody's got to say but to not have him understand
[03:04:10.160 --> 03:04:14.400]  that that that we're being destroyed while he's being destroyed and he's being lied to we're
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:18.720]  to come back roger with this message of trump about what he needs to do because what's come and go
[03:04:18.720 --> 03:04:24.160]  through everything you just said this is your message to the president that if he doesn't save
[03:04:24.160 --> 03:04:30.400]  himself he's destroying us as well and he's gone so far his instincts have been good but that's
[03:04:30.400 --> 03:04:35.280]  instincts on policy not on instincts of who he hires or what he does all right this is a very
[03:04:35.280 --> 03:04:39.760]  important segment straight ahead it's total red alert i cannot ask listeners and viewers enough
[03:04:39.760 --> 03:04:46.080]  to think of every way you can how do you get this live feed out how do you take this later when
[03:04:46.080 --> 03:05:12.560]  it's uploaders of video and get it out to everybody because that's what needs to happen raise the alarm
[03:05:12.560 --> 03:05:19.200]  there are so many different spectrums of this natural oil that comes from him now legal and
[03:05:19.200 --> 03:05:25.600]  lawful in all 50 states that you need to just go research it for yourself this is not marijuana
[03:05:25.600 --> 03:05:30.960]  there are hundreds of varieties of him this is industrial hemp that has all the good attributes
[03:05:30.960 --> 03:05:36.240]  but not the bad attributes people wonder why i've gotten to cbd oil well because some of the stuff's
[03:05:36.240 --> 03:05:42.080]  got problems some of it can get you high and some of it can get you arrested this is not that legal
[03:05:42.080 --> 03:05:48.240]  in all 50 states it's from hemp not marijuana it's totally legal again ladies and gentlemen we
[03:05:48.240 --> 03:05:53.680]  can ship to all 50 states right now from the great website washington's reserve dot com
[03:05:53.680 --> 03:06:10.880]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[03:06:10.880 --> 03:06:24.560]  it's friday january 18th 2019 i'm alex jones your host as we speak robert moeller through abc news
[03:06:24.560 --> 03:06:29.280]  the washington post has led us to know he plans to arrest myself my father robert stone for
[03:06:29.920 --> 03:06:37.440]  hush money payments to drum coursey that are 100 total fabrications and lies but it's just like
[03:06:37.440 --> 03:06:42.400]  the other desperation that's going to be breaking very soon over the weekend other attempts by moeller
[03:06:42.400 --> 03:06:47.440]  to set up info wars the documents all of it we didn't leak it somebody did so okay fine we'll
[03:06:47.440 --> 03:06:53.360]  cover it again they did it themselves this is incredible roger let's speak to the president now
[03:06:54.640 --> 03:07:01.200]  about where we stand and what he needs to do if he's going to stop this because i have to tell
[03:07:01.200 --> 03:07:06.240]  president trump something i only got mad at him over a year and a half ago when he promised not to
[03:07:06.240 --> 03:07:09.920]  strike syria and they had a false flag and he did it and i thought he was going back on warmongering
[03:07:10.960 --> 03:07:15.760]  and stopping that and now i really respect him as rand paul does very proud of him not
[03:07:15.760 --> 03:07:19.840]  wanting to destabilize the middle east scenarios but wanting to bring back our troops save the money
[03:07:19.840 --> 03:07:24.080]  to rebuild our infrastructure take care of our veterans put in space-based weapons that give us
[03:07:24.080 --> 03:07:31.520]  real dominance not our troops dying and sand and blood that said though if president trump won't
[03:07:31.520 --> 03:07:35.680]  defend himself and his family and won't recognize what he's doing won't recognize that his advisors
[03:07:35.680 --> 03:07:41.680]  put the worst deep state people in to betray him over and over again then i'm going to fight the
[03:07:41.680 --> 03:07:45.280]  globalist i'm going to fight for family values i'm going to fight not to sexualize children
[03:07:45.280 --> 03:07:49.680]  i'm going to fight for sovereignty and better trade deals but i'm going to abandon president trump
[03:07:50.640 --> 03:07:57.440]  because it's not even a lesser of two evils if he doesn't take action he's allowing them
[03:07:57.440 --> 03:08:02.000]  to set him up and destroy him so in the eight minutes we have left our message from alex jose
[03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:08.000]  and rogers stone about what trump needs to do to take action or destroy himself in the country
[03:08:09.360 --> 03:08:15.040]  well alex i would say beware the eyes of march because i think that is their game plan that's
[03:08:15.040 --> 03:08:21.600]  what my sources that's what your sources are telling us their their plan a has always been
[03:08:21.600 --> 03:08:27.200]  to try to jack the president up on some bogus fabricated claim of russian collusion because
[03:08:27.200 --> 03:08:32.960]  you see that not only removes donald trump but it also would remove vice president mike pence
[03:08:32.960 --> 03:08:38.720]  paving the way for a polosi presidency she then designates hillary as her vice president
[03:08:39.280 --> 03:08:47.200]  then polosi resigns hillary becomes president and the 19 the 2016 presidential election
[03:08:47.200 --> 03:08:53.520]  is voided that is their plan let's make no mistake about it now the president can do a
[03:08:53.520 --> 03:09:00.160]  number of things but tweeting about them is not going to do it a he needs to order his justice
[03:09:00.160 --> 03:09:08.080]  department to initiate antitrust action against the google giants twitter facebook google apple
[03:09:08.080 --> 03:09:13.840]  etc immediately because if we can't communicate among each other and if we can't amplify his
[03:09:13.840 --> 03:09:20.880]  message his chances of saving his presidency are zero secondarily the best defense is an offense
[03:09:20.880 --> 03:09:25.440]  he needs to disinstruct the acting attorney general matthew whitaker who's going to be there
[03:09:25.440 --> 03:09:32.800]  until mr bar is presumably confirmed to appoint a special counsel on the matter of uranium one
[03:09:32.800 --> 03:09:39.120]  convene a grand jury and bring criminal indictments against everyone involved including bill hillary
[03:09:39.120 --> 03:09:45.680]  mr muller and others thirdly he needs to limit the probe which there are constitutional arguments
[03:09:45.680 --> 03:09:53.440]  that he can do of the current muller investigation to rushing collusion of which there is none zero
[03:09:53.440 --> 03:10:03.680]  nada then uh he clearly needs to uh to uh move to fortify his support in the united state senate
[03:10:03.680 --> 03:10:11.920]  the house is history the house under the tutelage of nancy polosi jerry nadler adam schiff maxine
[03:10:11.920 --> 03:10:18.480]  waters and this cabal of criminals is going to vote articles of impeachment now they don't want to
[03:10:18.480 --> 03:10:24.800]  do it on the basis of his tax returns or his real estate developments or the use of his hotels by
[03:10:24.800 --> 03:10:31.280]  government officials it has to be russia related because they have to get pens too although get
[03:10:31.280 --> 03:10:36.160]  don't get me wrong the deep state would be much happier with a pence presidency as long as they
[03:10:36.160 --> 03:10:41.840]  can get rid of donald trump but but but hillary and the globalist at soros and the chai coms they want
[03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:47.040]  total power they want implosion of america men and women fighting with each other race war the
[03:10:47.040 --> 03:10:52.560]  democrats are ready to deliver the marxian takedown well and let's be very clear what they have in
[03:10:52.560 --> 03:11:00.400]  mind for you and me and your dad they're going to attempt to indict us for witness tampering uh
[03:11:00.400 --> 03:11:07.600]  based on a phony allegation put forward by jerry corsie who used to work at info wars that that
[03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:14.160]  for some reason uh payments made to him for the actual work he did at info wars constituted
[03:11:14.160 --> 03:11:22.640]  hush money hush money for what the whole thing is bullshiff with an f it's nonsense the whole idea
[03:11:22.640 --> 03:11:29.040]  that the memo he created documenting the pedestrian brothers russian involvement was part of a
[03:11:29.040 --> 03:11:33.120]  cover story that would be what we're supposedly and you have all the emails all the things this is
[03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:37.680]  i was there this is insane but that's what i mean but well here's the deal they're announcing
[03:11:37.680 --> 03:11:42.720]  they're gonna indict his uh his his stepson who worked for him reportedly wiped the computer
[03:11:42.720 --> 03:11:48.160]  and you know it's it's just listen that's why i jumped on him so hard we first learned
[03:11:48.160 --> 03:11:52.720]  that he was putting all this bull was because i was there when he was drunk falling down he's like
[03:11:53.520 --> 03:11:57.920]  you're shameful you and roger are gonna get it right i've been with the government for a long
[03:11:57.920 --> 03:12:02.560]  time here and i guess he was like an fb i'm former forever like in eastern europe or something
[03:12:02.560 --> 03:12:06.080]  i mean i know he wrote all these best-selling books except for lou dobbs and everything but
[03:12:06.080 --> 03:12:10.320]  let's talk about that he developed the fake birther thing that created division this guy
[03:12:10.320 --> 03:12:16.480]  pushed killing on i think he is actually cute well just the fact that he would go on the air
[03:12:16.480 --> 03:12:22.640]  with arie melbur just the fact that he would talk to shelby holliday who is a deep state
[03:12:22.640 --> 03:12:27.920]  quisling and the single most you ever notice no one will interview me like i am the guy they will
[03:12:27.920 --> 03:12:34.160]  not talk to well i you know what clearly i'm moving into the same realm i mean very deeply
[03:12:34.160 --> 03:12:40.160]  disappointed that trish reagan who i really like at box has now give jerry corsia forum twice to
[03:12:40.160 --> 03:12:44.720]  defame me lying with a straight face by the way you can always tell when jerry's lying
[03:12:44.720 --> 03:12:49.920]  his lips are moving uh but they won't afford me an opportunity to come on and defend myself
[03:12:49.920 --> 03:12:53.520]  don't you think they're gonna give him a common treatment though that you know after they've
[03:12:53.520 --> 03:12:56.480]  squeezed everything out of him they want to discredit him because he worked with him
[03:12:56.480 --> 03:13:02.240]  and they'll just kind of flush him down the toilet oh there's no question he he will he will do his
[03:13:02.240 --> 03:13:08.400]  dirty work to try to take us down but he will not escape the wrath of the special council they will
[03:13:08.400 --> 03:13:13.840]  destroy him too that's the sad part you would think with a person of his sophistication who's
[03:13:13.840 --> 03:13:18.880]  been around the block that he would understand that but he's getting the worst possible advice
[03:13:18.880 --> 03:13:24.480]  from this clown larry claimant well so i think there's a lot of alcohol induced dementia well
[03:13:24.480 --> 03:13:29.360]  it's true and people need to understand claimant was ousted from judicial watch an organization he
[03:13:29.360 --> 03:13:36.160]  founded over a sexual harassment claim he was also disciplined by the dc bar he was thrown off the
[03:13:36.160 --> 03:13:41.200]  bundy case key uh well let's be clear i don't want to get in a fight with claimant but i was walking
[03:13:41.200 --> 03:13:44.800]  through the office a few months ago i think i went and had him on or something he's like
[03:13:44.800 --> 03:13:50.240]  i'm loyal course he's loyal and i hope alex is loyal it was like a hunting dog looking around
[03:13:50.240 --> 03:13:55.680]  it i was like i was like what and i called you and go oh yeah man i've been warned and it's like
[03:13:55.680 --> 03:14:01.200]  you see this stuff and then like as you know i don't give it an inside baseball the media admits
[03:14:01.920 --> 03:14:07.040]  that coursey is the one like they've got us telling us that we gave him hush money that
[03:14:07.040 --> 03:14:13.680]  he's outrageous it's just insane it's not like we enjoy attacking people who are
[03:14:13.680 --> 03:14:18.240]  ostensibly other conservatives or other trump supporters because we don't but we're not the
[03:14:18.240 --> 03:14:24.320]  ones bearing false witness against jerry coursey jerry coursey has agreed to a pack of lies suggested
[03:14:24.320 --> 03:14:32.480]  to him by robert moeller uh and he intends to be their their bitch and it is very very disappointing
[03:14:32.480 --> 03:14:38.560]  i know you alex and i know myself in my own heart i will fight to the bitter end you can
[03:14:38.560 --> 03:14:44.320]  threaten indict my wife you can threaten to attack my children they stand with me we will
[03:14:44.320 --> 03:14:50.080]  fight we have done nothing wrong we have broken no laws there is no russian collusion there is no
[03:14:50.080 --> 03:14:57.120]  wiki in this collaboration and jerry coursey is a alcohol adult liar who was perfectly willing to
[03:14:57.120 --> 03:15:02.400]  throw another and here's the bottom line he's just judas to scare it because they can't starve us out
[03:15:02.400 --> 03:15:06.880]  and they can't make us run i mean it really comes down and let's get past us we're important but
[03:15:06.880 --> 03:15:11.200]  they're making their move on trump they're making it in march we've been told they've got all their
[03:15:11.200 --> 03:15:15.120]  fake stuff going on and they're threatening everybody most people are rolling over it's very
[03:15:15.120 --> 03:15:20.880]  very sad and these are the globalist mother works you know and sells us out to the chai comms the russians
[03:15:20.880 --> 03:15:26.880]  everybody they're making their big giant move now and trump we're introduced under nick beggars whose

[03:20:51.760 --> 03:20:56.080]  if you won't stand up against me you'll only be a slave if you're trying to fool me
[03:20:56.080 --> 03:21:01.440]  they will push you around and take you to their place they come again they come women again stand

[03:21:12.080 --> 03:21:17.120]  the people above you that are inviting you into their new world order they're slaves
[03:21:17.120 --> 03:21:21.920]  they're sold out to it they're they're blind to their towers you don't want to be part of them
[03:21:21.920 --> 03:21:26.160]  like patrick henry says forget you are our president go from us to peace
[03:21:26.160 --> 03:21:31.680]  crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you let your chains sit lightly upon you
[03:21:32.640 --> 03:21:36.560]  and for me give me liberty or give me death
[03:21:36.560 --> 03:21:48.080]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[03:21:59.920 --> 03:22:03.840]  all right nick baggots great patriots taking over i want to get final comments from roger
[03:22:03.840 --> 03:22:08.720]  stone but i've made my statement to trump i've made my statement to the world i've made my statement
[03:22:08.720 --> 03:22:14.640]  about how they're not trying to put myself and my dear sweet father in prison that makes
[03:22:14.640 --> 03:22:18.720]  me want to fight that much harder against these liars and make sure robert moeller goes to prison
[03:22:18.720 --> 03:22:23.920]  and hillary clinton goes to prison the stakes are so high and these people these sociopaths
[03:22:23.920 --> 03:22:28.000]  are reaching for it all but in closing roger i wanted to give the deep state a warning and have
[03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:33.680]  you speak to that because trump's right when he told prominent individuals recently that he believes
[03:22:33.680 --> 03:22:38.080]  americans are too well armed he means that in a good way and that they will have a civil war
[03:22:38.800 --> 03:22:44.480]  if they try to remove him well that's true if he leads and doesn't just send out tweets and
[03:22:44.480 --> 03:22:52.160]  really gets on the offense about what's happening i don't want to have that civil war but at the same
[03:22:52.160 --> 03:22:59.840]  time i can't as i've said a thousand times the globalists were just boss hogs and they just
[03:22:59.840 --> 03:23:04.560]  wanted to run stuff and they weren't trying to teach kids how to have sex with pedophiles
[03:23:05.280 --> 03:23:09.680]  or pushing all this evil globalism or bringing in radical muslims i'd oppose them and be for
[03:23:09.680 --> 03:23:15.760]  another group that was better but i would not be risking my life it's not just an honor it's a duty
[03:23:15.760 --> 03:23:23.280]  and a pleasure and a compulsion to fight this new world order because even though i was an atheist
[03:23:23.280 --> 03:23:28.320]  if you look at this globalist system it's the definition of satan so i think that the establishment
[03:23:28.320 --> 03:23:34.640]  needs to know and all these vitriolic low IQ people that have some existential envy or of success
[03:23:34.640 --> 03:23:39.920]  or goodness or whatever it is that want a war with everybody i don't think they understand the door
[03:23:39.920 --> 03:23:46.400]  they're opening because i can play a few you know pieces down the board here which it seems evil
[03:23:46.400 --> 03:23:52.240]  people don't ever look into into deeper levels and all i see is their total destruction which i
[03:23:52.240 --> 03:23:59.440]  don't even want but if my destruction has to trigger in the end what has to happen i am extremely
[03:23:59.440 --> 03:24:03.840]  honored so i want to go out as a winner whether we get them to back off and stop we have a renaissance
[03:24:03.840 --> 03:24:08.160]  whether we get destroyed this process they're gonna lie about us create a false history
[03:24:08.160 --> 03:24:12.720]  so folks you know we are where we wanted to be and we stood up for what was right roger
[03:24:14.240 --> 03:24:19.600]  well alex you know several months ago you told me great detail about a sting operation in which
[03:24:19.600 --> 03:24:25.120]  there was an attempt to set you up with faux evidence of russian collusion and i gave you the
[03:24:25.120 --> 03:24:31.440]  documents it i've reviewed them it's completely bogus but it's outrageous it was the most brazen
[03:24:31.440 --> 03:24:38.560]  thing i've ever seen just to be clear you've never taken a dime from any russian entity period none
[03:24:38.560 --> 03:24:47.600]  rt the internet research agency anybody else concord this is all bs bs that now sadly is not
[03:24:47.600 --> 03:24:54.800]  only being promulgated by the likes of adam schiff and robert moeller and other deep staters but
[03:24:54.800 --> 03:25:04.320]  with the complicity of dr jerry coursey judas ascaria now he's using msnbc cnn to defame me
[03:25:04.320 --> 03:25:11.040]  now to defame you people need to understand he's a quisling he's a snake in a grass he's not a
[03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:16.640]  supporter of the president he's not the patriot we thought he was it's it's wounding because i did
[03:25:16.640 --> 03:25:21.280]  have some affection for him i did have some respect for him but now i understand he's
[03:25:21.280 --> 03:25:27.200]  prepared to say whatever his new handlers want him to say in an effort to help close him for wars
[03:25:27.200 --> 03:25:32.880]  down and destroy you and more importantly at this point destroy me because they're afraid i might
[03:25:32.880 --> 03:25:39.040]  tell let's be honest we'll go ahead and say go ahead declassify the documents mr president bring the
[03:25:39.040 --> 03:25:45.520]  whole house of cards down devin nunes has seen the fights of warrants he knows it leads directly
[03:25:45.520 --> 03:25:50.240]  jim jordan devin nunes are amazing patriots they've been total they're willing to fight
[03:25:50.240 --> 03:25:54.640]  rand paul's willing to fight and let's expand on that one man against a bunch of cowards is you
[03:25:54.640 --> 03:26:00.720]  101 will win that's the thing that's so painful about all this is that we have all the cards and
[03:26:00.720 --> 03:26:08.560]  then we sit back and ask why doesn't trump play the cards it just it confounds me and then watching
[03:26:08.560 --> 03:26:14.800]  rudy juliani who i like and who's an old friend of mine who i think it has the president's best
[03:26:14.800 --> 03:26:20.800]  interests at heart say well there may have been russian collusion but donald trump didn't know about
[03:26:20.800 --> 03:26:27.440]  what is he talking about 30 million dollars two years in they don't have a shred a centella well
[03:26:27.440 --> 03:26:32.720]  his full quote was they haven't found any evidence but i'm not on any president i'm i represent the
[03:26:32.720 --> 03:26:36.240]  president he a hundred percent hasn't because he doesn't they don't know what like there's one more
[03:26:36.240 --> 03:26:41.120]  guy talked to a russian once or whatever his full thing makes sense he's just being too real with
[03:26:41.120 --> 03:26:46.960]  these people not knowing what liars they are like steve king said national you know white
[03:26:46.960 --> 03:26:52.640]  supremacism is not the same as nationalism and then they turn that into he defends white supremacism
[03:26:52.640 --> 03:26:58.240]  the quote anymore on can see what it says but they make it all a false quote so i just think his
[03:26:58.240 --> 03:27:03.600]  failure is juliani doesn't understand we're entering the end game here where they are going to lie
[03:27:03.600 --> 03:27:09.520]  about the president at every level there's no question they have shifted into high gear so at
[03:27:09.520 --> 03:27:14.560]  least previously you could combat the lives with truth and the lack of evidence the lack of
[03:27:14.560 --> 03:27:19.920]  corroboration but now none of that matters i watched anderson cooper who i kind of like to be
[03:27:19.920 --> 03:27:25.280]  honest with you you've been very fair with me on the air but the other night insisting that trump
[03:27:25.280 --> 03:27:30.320]  was involved with the russians well wait a minute what about barack obama saying into a hot mic
[03:27:30.320 --> 03:27:35.120]  after i'm reelected i'll have more but what about iranian one the crazy part is they show an image
[03:27:35.120 --> 03:27:40.880]  of trump at g20 meetings and they go look he's with them it's it's like you read the article
[03:27:40.880 --> 03:27:45.920]  it's like five pages long there's no proof yeah it's it's next level believe me uh having them
[03:27:45.920 --> 03:27:51.360]  try to say that my dad works for the russians and uh you know all the rest of it is it's just
[03:27:51.360 --> 03:27:57.200]  i already knew it was bs but now it actually makes me not be afraid at all it just makes me go into
[03:27:57.200 --> 03:28:03.920]  total war mode because i mean my god why why did bolger work with moller to kill all these people
[03:28:03.920 --> 03:28:10.000]  and do all this horrible stuff moller is a drug dealing pimp moller is like just a horrible psychotic
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:15.120]  and people go they go yeah he's a psychotic back down no let me tell you something god's going to
[03:28:15.120 --> 03:28:20.160]  deal with moller and i'm not going to be the one spending a hundred thousand trillion years
[03:28:20.800 --> 03:28:26.640]  in a in a subterranean dungeon with the devil so this you know whatever roger great job i'm going

[03:34:55.520 --> 03:34:58.800]  these segments talk about what he wants to appreciate him let me take some time earlier
[03:34:58.800 --> 03:35:05.360]  to speak to political and physical sacrifice for the truth because i'm not up here as a victim
[03:35:05.360 --> 03:35:10.160]  i'm very honored to be having weller openly trying to indict me and my father for no reason
[03:35:10.160 --> 03:35:14.640]  i am extremely honored to be involved in all this and trying to restart a renaissance because

[03:35:21.040 --> 03:35:25.920]  as this gets worse film were fulfilled because i know i'm not bad i know i'm american a human
[03:35:25.920 --> 03:35:31.280]  that stood up for humanity my nationalism is humanity but i'm an american i'm proud of america
[03:35:31.280 --> 03:35:35.920]  and so nick i'm and i'll take over i'll talk a lot so you take over i'm gonna talk again but
[03:35:35.920 --> 03:35:40.560]  your your your advice to me and everybody else being persecuted tonight on friday night because i
[03:35:40.560 --> 03:35:44.320]  know you've been through a lot in your own family about where we're going because anything worse
[03:35:44.320 --> 03:35:47.920]  something's going to be a big price and you know you've you've paid more than i have you know you
[03:35:47.920 --> 03:35:52.160]  pay with your dad and who you who transferred hundreds of billions of dollars to the people
[03:35:52.160 --> 03:35:57.680]  and uh we saw what happened so tell us tell us about about about that and your advice to us
[03:35:57.680 --> 03:36:03.200]  tonight's we're listening you bet and and i'm i'm glad we're on this uh tonight particularly in
[03:36:03.200 --> 03:36:09.520]  fact this is where i really wanted to start my whole program was about this because my family
[03:36:09.520 --> 03:36:16.160]  has three generations uh at the local state and national and international levels in influencing
[03:36:16.160 --> 03:36:23.760]  political thinking and how to get ideas into the public uh domain now that's from the left to the
[03:36:23.760 --> 03:36:29.680]  to the right and everything in between you know when you look at my family's configuration but
[03:36:29.680 --> 03:36:35.360]  but this is the standard uh practice uh first they attack you economically they did my dad a
[03:36:35.360 --> 03:36:41.360]  number of occasions um when my dad was in his early career as a state senator uh we were living i'll
[03:36:41.360 --> 03:36:47.280]  give you a story we're living on the basis and they gave us 90 days to vacuate the base basically
[03:36:47.280 --> 03:36:51.920]  my dad was a superintendent of schools for the military uh installations here in anchorage
[03:36:51.920 --> 03:36:59.440]  um and and essentially he was a state senator and a um uh and a superintendent at the same time
[03:36:59.440 --> 03:37:04.320]  and so they brought it into the state courts my dad lost he couldn't hold two two state jobs
[03:37:04.320 --> 03:37:10.560]  same time he had four children at home the uh superintendent paid 18 000 a year which in the
[03:37:10.560 --> 03:37:17.120]  early 60s was a lot of money and the senate paid six my dad quit the superintendent's job figured
[03:37:17.120 --> 03:37:23.680]  out how to be a builder you know that's a long story too long for today but he did not cave in
[03:37:23.680 --> 03:37:28.240]  and that was sort of the first attempt you know there were a lot of attempts to my dad's career
[03:37:28.240 --> 03:37:35.360]  and when they couldn't bribe him corrupt him uh in any way um basically they they ended it you know
[03:37:35.360 --> 03:37:40.480]  they they took him out or at least um when the opportunity did not find him came up they didn't
[03:37:40.480 --> 03:37:45.520]  go get him and that's what let me let's describe his plane went down never found that's correct
[03:37:45.520 --> 03:37:50.640]  and uh just like just like larry mcdonnell and everybody else right and this was the official
[03:37:50.640 --> 03:37:57.680]  story but unofficially and then later uh fb itelix has proved that this was um not the case at all
[03:37:57.680 --> 03:38:04.320]  in fact uh uh the government did know where they were didn't recover the bodies now what's important
[03:38:04.320 --> 03:38:09.520]  right now and what's i see happening with many of the influence makers around the world including
[03:38:09.520 --> 03:38:16.000]  you alex is we're being uh the push is to take us off message so they attack us personally with
[03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:19.760]  the idea that we're going to come in and i'm glad you that was the whole point today is it's meant
[03:38:19.760 --> 03:38:25.600]  to make us get off message while we defend ourselves that's right and we we need to recognize that the
[03:38:25.600 --> 03:38:34.000]  defense is in the ideas in the debate that we invigorate as policy makers policy shapers because
[03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:39.360]  that's who you are that's who i am that's who roger stone is that's who everybody who engages
[03:38:39.360 --> 03:38:44.480]  as a disruptor the status quo and that's what they're really fighting so they first try to
[03:38:44.480 --> 03:38:50.080]  attack you personally get you off message so you're being defensive uh you know people know who we
[03:38:50.080 --> 03:38:57.120]  are because we've been at this a very very long time uh myself 25 years you 23 years we've been
[03:38:57.120 --> 03:39:02.560]  working together since the very beginning of both of our public work in the international arena
[03:39:02.560 --> 03:39:08.480]  and staying on message is critical and providing solutions and this is you know if you think back
[03:39:08.480 --> 03:39:13.040]  remember when ross perot was the big thing in the early 90s you were a very young man then
[03:39:13.040 --> 03:39:20.320]  and it was a guy chuck harder who had for the people radio network and when the uh institutions of
[03:39:20.320 --> 03:39:26.320]  the establishment came in to shut him down it was the snake under the door they came in they
[03:39:26.320 --> 03:39:31.280]  infiltrated his organization and then eventually they took it away from him and you never heard
[03:39:31.280 --> 03:39:38.320]  again about ross perot but he was a single biggest policy maker at the time as a broadcaster which is
[03:39:38.320 --> 03:39:43.280]  exactly where you're at only now we're in a very different decade a very different century in fact
[03:39:43.280 --> 03:39:49.200]  where the ability to censure and shut down public debate is even more pressing that's why we have to
[03:39:49.200 --> 03:39:57.120]  stay on our messages we have to continue to debate and people who listen to us pick up the phone
[03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:05.920]  and make those calls to your legislative bodies to your legislators let them know you're watching
[03:40:05.920 --> 03:40:09.680]  let them know to reestablish just think is your censored on facebook and twitter everywhere
[03:40:09.680 --> 03:40:14.880]  that you can't march or call or get involved and i totally agree doc so so what would you
[03:40:14.880 --> 03:40:19.360]  say to trump then clearly the word is they're building up towards a move against him he means
[03:40:19.360 --> 03:40:25.120]  well but he doesn't know how to pick the right people he's be so betrayed and uh they're all
[03:40:25.120 --> 03:40:30.640]  around him they're all around him and he has to be true to himself and his gut and his intuition
[03:40:30.640 --> 03:40:37.760]  and i would say this is quit responding to everything they say and no i agree like you said
[03:40:37.760 --> 03:40:42.480]  get on his own message but in ram paul said he's really proud of me he's trying to pull trips out
[03:40:42.480 --> 03:40:50.160]  that's right that's trump's instincts but i agree stop responding attack attack on your ideas and i
[03:40:50.160 --> 03:40:57.280]  would say this if the media won't cover you then do the fireside chat once a week do an hour and
[03:40:57.280 --> 03:41:03.840]  talk directly to the american people and lay out your ideas for the week and get rid of you know

[03:47:22.560 --> 03:47:31.520]  jones show and welcome back to info wars dot com and this is uh dr nick baggage and i'm
[03:47:31.520 --> 03:47:38.000]  standing in this last bit of a time on this last segment you know this is a really important issue
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:44.480]  and you know when i laid out my program for today i wanted to talk about a lot of the things that
[03:47:44.480 --> 03:47:51.440]  we've hit on you know and the timing couldn't be better as these things go i had 22 pages of notes
[03:47:51.440 --> 03:47:56.960]  i'm not gonna refer to any of them at the moment but i want to talk about what what happens and i
[03:47:56.960 --> 03:48:02.560]  want to develop this story a little bit better from a personal perspective you know and and again
[03:48:02.560 --> 03:48:09.600]  i've been involved in a lot of things politically as an organizer you know for all different kinds
[03:48:09.600 --> 03:48:14.560]  of initiatives but basically my whole life i mean i was raised and i'm 60 years old now
[03:48:15.600 --> 03:48:20.960]  you know my son is now engaged in this in his 40s and and and i think about my dad and then my
[03:48:20.960 --> 03:48:26.000]  grandfather even in some of the things he did as an immigrant coming into the united states but
[03:48:26.000 --> 03:48:33.200]  being involved in in grassroots kind of organizing as a as a labor person in the 1930s when labor
[03:48:33.200 --> 03:48:38.240]  organizing consisted of having a bigger bat than your opponent and waiting into the crowd when
[03:48:38.240 --> 03:48:44.800]  the pinkertons were attacking you so you know there's a whole history of um conflict and sort of
[03:48:44.800 --> 03:48:50.000]  resolution starting with a a little bit of a rougher period in our history and and and coming
[03:48:50.000 --> 03:48:58.640]  into the 21st century and what i really want to say today is um now more than ever is a time for
[03:48:59.440 --> 03:49:08.240]  focus a time for calm in the middle of the storm and a time to take stock in who we are what we
[03:49:08.240 --> 03:49:13.200]  are and what's possible uh you know and and and i want to get into the little bit of esoteric
[03:49:13.200 --> 03:49:18.480]  side of this because it's the essence of what we are i believe that we're you know spiritual beings
[03:49:18.480 --> 03:49:25.280]  occupying physical bodies i believe in the divinity of the human being in the sense of being create
[03:49:25.280 --> 03:49:31.840]  created in the image and likeness of god i believe in that as a foundational fundamental
[03:49:31.840 --> 03:49:38.560]  of who i am and who we are which means um a lot to me i mean in a real sense in how i
[03:49:39.120 --> 03:49:44.000]  attempt to project in the world world and and i screw up like everybody else in that projection
[03:49:44.000 --> 03:49:50.400]  uh in the world i make mistakes and i learn from them but what i also learn is a lot from my
[03:49:50.400 --> 03:49:56.640]  adversaries i learn a lot from those that would call themselves my adversaries and and i look at
[03:49:56.640 --> 03:50:03.120]  them as my information sources quite frankly um i want a discussion with those that don't think
[03:50:03.120 --> 03:50:09.440]  like me i want a discussion a dialogue i want to extract from those that don't think like me
[03:50:09.440 --> 03:50:14.640]  me what takes them to the place where they come to their conclusions because i really want the
[03:50:14.640 --> 03:50:18.720]  information because it's going to show me a couple of things it's going to demonstrate for me what
[03:50:18.720 --> 03:50:24.960]  i'm missing so i can be a more fully informed person or it's going to show me clearly what
[03:50:24.960 --> 03:50:30.160]  they're missing and information and provide me a gateway an opportunity a porthole if you will
[03:50:30.800 --> 03:50:36.000]  to provide more data and maybe end up in a different kind of a dialogue but one that heads
[03:50:36.000 --> 03:50:42.240]  eventually towards solutions because this is what a uh participating in a democratic republic is
[03:50:42.240 --> 03:50:51.200]  about it's about eventually reaching uh solutions now what the media has done is fail fail in their
[03:50:51.200 --> 03:50:56.400]  foundational mission mission under the first amendment which is really intended because when
[03:50:56.400 --> 03:51:02.160]  you look at the amendment it's intended to keep a well-informed public that's what the press is
[03:51:02.160 --> 03:51:11.440]  about that's what info wars think about the name itself info wars it's what it was all about it's
[03:51:11.440 --> 03:51:20.240]  what it's always been about information warfare now you can look at all the formal forms of propaganda
[03:51:20.240 --> 03:51:26.080]  manipulation all that stuff that i've covered in other segments uh not for today because i want to
[03:51:26.080 --> 03:51:33.600]  talk about it more fundamentally today that if you truly believe that you're created in the likeness
[03:51:33.600 --> 03:51:41.600]  and image of god then it demands uh that we have respect uh for others in a reasonable way and that
[03:51:41.600 --> 03:51:46.320]  we present our arguments in reasonable ways not with anger not with bitterness and we talked a
[03:51:46.320 --> 03:51:51.280]  little while ago about my dad's disappearance and then they'll fail to recover you know i was 14 years
[03:51:51.280 --> 03:51:56.960]  old and my dad disappeared with the majority of the u.s house um there were six kids in my
[03:51:56.960 --> 03:52:03.840]  household um i was 14 the youngest was four and my mom in her mid 30s you know had to complete the
[03:52:03.840 --> 03:52:11.360]  mission of raising six kids uh you know and in that we became very different kind of adults from
[03:52:11.360 --> 03:52:18.880]  republicans uh conservatives libertarians democrats you know everything all across the map
[03:52:18.880 --> 03:52:24.800]  but we learned how to debate vigorously our beliefs and with a lot of energy our beliefs but we
[03:52:24.800 --> 03:52:29.840]  still embrace each other as brothers and sisters we love each other as brothers and sisters we
[03:52:29.840 --> 03:52:36.960]  define and defend each other's right uh to free speech no matter what we personally felt about
[03:52:36.960 --> 03:52:43.840]  what was being said this is the model if you will uh that our country began with it's the model that
[03:52:43.840 --> 03:52:49.280]  all of us should be embracing recognize the divinity of each and every human and then as
[03:52:49.280 --> 03:52:56.320]  we recognize that divinity step into our divinity self-examination is required right now if we're
[03:52:56.320 --> 03:53:01.120]  reacting to everything that's coming up in a negative way or in a hostile way we need to
[03:53:01.120 --> 03:53:07.040]  examine ourselves we need to look at that again and recognize is that who we want to be is that
[03:53:07.040 --> 03:53:15.520]  how we want to project in the world is that the the strength the power uh that we wish to display
[03:53:15.520 --> 03:53:25.040]  in the world uh that form of ignorant weakness informed action against a belief system that you
[03:53:25.040 --> 03:53:31.280]  embrace being true and honest is the critical element and true speech think about that as a
[03:53:31.280 --> 03:53:39.280]  fundamental now everyone engages in false speech from time to time you know somebody asked you
[03:53:39.840 --> 03:53:47.440]  how's your day and you say great when it really isn't are you lying yeah yeah you really are um
[03:53:47.440 --> 03:53:53.520]  and so what's the better response to say well i am having some things going on how about the truth
[03:53:53.520 --> 03:53:59.760]  you know the truth is transparency and begins to remove blinders we should become a pattern to the
[03:53:59.760 --> 03:54:06.560]  truth uh in our speech um and then what we say and recognize the responsibility when we say something
[03:54:07.360 --> 03:54:14.400]  that that level of responsibility is there and so when we're attacked yeah okay they're
[03:54:14.400 --> 03:54:21.280]  responsible for the attack but we are responsible for the response and i say stay on message i say
[03:54:22.160 --> 03:54:28.000]  make sure that your brain and your heart are connected and your emotion and your intellect
[03:54:28.000 --> 03:54:34.560]  tie together and bring into harmony those two aspects of yourself which could also be defined as
[03:54:34.560 --> 03:54:40.320]  you know left brain right brain know the ordered side the left brain and the chaotic side the
[03:54:40.320 --> 03:54:47.120]  creative side the right brain think about that in terms of um all of the things that divide us
[03:54:48.640 --> 03:54:55.440]  women and men left and right up and down you know the world negative and positive charges
[03:54:55.440 --> 03:55:03.360]  you know the world is polarized for sure the objective is to find unity in the polarity think
[03:55:03.360 --> 03:55:11.360]  about this this is stewardship of the planet fundamentally and stewardship towards each other
[03:55:11.360 --> 03:55:19.200]  divinely created human soul this is our responsibility this is our calling at the 11th hour
[03:55:19.200 --> 03:55:26.480]  five minutes to midnight it's to rise up into what we've been to be created not violent angry bitter
[03:55:26.480 --> 03:55:31.120]  souls it would be easy and it would have been easy for me to be bitter over what happened
[03:55:31.760 --> 03:55:37.920]  in the disappearance of my dad as a young person i'm not bitter i it was in fact and i've said
[03:55:37.920 --> 03:55:46.080]  this at other broadcasts it was the single biggest most important life changing event in my life
[03:55:46.080 --> 03:55:52.800]  life both in terms of its negative traumatic impact but more importantly and how i overcame
[03:55:52.800 --> 03:56:00.880]  that impact by recognition recognition that it changed me it did what my dad could never do
[03:56:01.600 --> 03:56:07.840]  as my parent alive he did by the disappearance totally changed me i became a very serious
[03:56:07.840 --> 03:56:12.560]  young person anyone that knew me then would tell you that and my whole life became a different
[03:56:12.560 --> 03:56:22.080]  trajectory because i chose i chose in the moment of my biggest trauma to choose a different path
[03:56:22.080 --> 03:56:31.520]  that's called free will this is where our divinity takes us this is why alex is fearless this is why
[03:56:31.520 --> 03:56:39.840]  i have been fearless this is why i stay on message because i know this is a short short stop this
[03:56:39.840 --> 03:56:50.720]  lifetime in eternity a short stop in who we are and what we do here does matter and we have to have
[03:56:50.720 --> 03:56:58.960]  meaning in that meaning for our individual lives so what my my suggestion is look inside examine
[03:56:58.960 --> 03:57:05.360]  your heart examine your thoughts as you begin to change the world again and let us reshape this
[03:57:05.360 --> 03:57:15.280]  next century in the image of god wow wouldn't that be something wouldn't that be amazing if we
[03:57:15.280 --> 03:57:21.680]  could integrate those values and i believe that the five minutes to midnight the power of god is
[03:57:21.680 --> 03:57:27.600]  descending on the planet and the gifts of the spirit will rise and the meek indeed with sword
[03:57:27.600 --> 03:57:33.200]  sheet we will be strong we will inherit the earth because we are strong this is info wars this has
