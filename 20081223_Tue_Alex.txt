[00:00.000 --> 00:14.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.680 --> 00:33.800]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones. It is December 23rd,
[00:33.800 --> 00:41.280]  2008. We're gonna be live here for the next four hours and who do we have joining us? Well
[00:41.280 --> 00:50.480]  briefly in the next hour the founder of levies.org Sandy Rosenthal who's been protesting the bad
[00:50.480 --> 00:55.760]  job the federal government did of constructing and maintaining the levies and the terrible job
[00:55.760 --> 01:00.960]  they did once the levies failed but the main reason she's going to be on with us is that she
[01:00.960 --> 01:07.080]  had the Army Corps of Engineers countering her covertly on the internet in a military
[01:07.080 --> 01:13.680]  propaganda campaign this ties into a larger picture of government propaganda going on against
[01:13.680 --> 01:21.000]  the American people on the web then detective John Carroll New Jersey detective 9-11 first
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.440]  responder is going to be joining us he's talking about quitting his job being a detective for 15
[01:26.440 --> 01:33.440]  years alone over the fact that his department will not investigate the evidence of 9-11 being
[01:33.440 --> 01:40.400]  an inside job and then tied in with that is Luke Radowski founder of we are change that
[01:40.400 --> 01:45.600]  spread worldwide they don't have the FBI harassing them down at ground zero and around New York
[01:45.600 --> 01:53.200]  City and then on top of that we have Robert K. Wilcox Arthur of Target Patton a London
[01:53.200 --> 01:58.720]  telegraph reported on declassified information and of course declassified diaries and an interview
[01:58.720 --> 02:06.840]  with the assassin what we already knew from military sources that general George S. Patton
[02:06.840 --> 02:15.960]  was assassinated namely because right at about 12,000 if you want to be technicals 11 and a
[02:15.960 --> 02:23.200]  half plus thousand US troops were in German prisoner of war camps that got liberated in quotes by
[02:23.200 --> 02:30.560]  the communist Russians the Stalinist Russians and they wanted their intel they wanted to
[02:30.560 --> 02:37.840]  pick the brain of the army airmen of the army forces themselves of some of the Marines and
[02:37.840 --> 02:46.480]  they wanted them for slave labor as well so they took them to Siberia and you know US troops
[02:46.480 --> 02:51.160]  were mixed in with the Russians at this time and witness didn't got very upset and Patton who'd
[02:51.160 --> 02:55.320]  already been criticized for during the war trying rescue missions for US and British
[02:55.320 --> 03:01.320]  troops in prisoner of war camps that were close to the lines when they were in German hands just
[03:01.320 --> 03:06.120]  couldn't believe it and so he started raising a ruckus over that so they killed him better than a
[03:06.120 --> 03:13.640]  hammer and that has now come out so and even one in telegraph is convinced of the documents and
[03:13.640 --> 03:20.240]  the evidence you don't normally see them come out and state something's on the record also you
[03:20.240 --> 03:26.360]  know Gulf of Tonkin is now admitted to have been a stage terror attack thousands of hours of
[03:26.360 --> 03:32.880]  presidential tapes have been released between McNamara and Johnson I had listened to scores of
[03:32.880 --> 03:38.680]  hours of it and thought that I'd heard it all I had heard the part of the tapes after they'd
[03:38.680 --> 03:45.400]  staged it when McNamara was saying okay we've staged it and Johnson saying okay what do I say
[03:45.400 --> 03:53.840]  what do I do I hadn't heard because it was 3,000 hours released what in 2004 I frankly I can't
[03:53.840 --> 04:00.000]  listen to all of it finally folks have listened to it more stuffs come out the day before they
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.840]  stage it they talk about how they're gonna stage it and so the press when the folks came across
[04:05.840 --> 04:10.400]  the tapes that we heard and others heard were thinking the military had staged it and then
[04:10.400 --> 04:16.400]  basically told Johnson to tag along now the tapes have surfaced people have listened to it all and
[04:16.400 --> 04:23.840]  or we hope all of it we have no way of knowing I stayed up several nights listening just to find
[04:23.840 --> 04:29.760]  the stuff I did find well there's there's more now and we're gonna be playing that Gulf of Tonkin
[04:29.760 --> 04:41.400]  as well today so big show Sandy Rosenthal Detective John Carroll Luke Ruddowski Robert K. Wilcox
[04:41.400 --> 04:48.560]  author of Target Patton it's all coming up today right here on the Alex Jones show Monday
[04:48.560 --> 04:53.200]  through Friday from 11 a.m. the 3 p.m. Central Standard Time we come back for an abbreviated
[04:53.200 --> 05:06.240]  transmission Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. Don't forget the free podcast and info wars.com big brother
[05:06.240 --> 05:15.760]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the
[05:15.760 --> 05:34.880]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones you know in the past I have
[05:34.880 --> 05:47.000]  done radio broadcast about parasites in the human body and since we got indoor plumbing and since
[05:47.000 --> 05:53.920]  we got more sanitation and began washing our hands by the 1930s we saw many types of infectious
[05:53.920 --> 06:02.560]  diseases a parasitical and of other types and plunge in fact with the advent a decade later
[06:02.560 --> 06:11.520]  of mass vaccination we saw actually a rebound in many of the viral and bacterial infections so
[06:11.520 --> 06:22.000]  most of what we see in reductions of infections and sickness was due to cleanliness due to washing
[06:22.000 --> 06:31.080]  our clothes due to not defecating out back the house in a privy into not having sewage running
[06:31.080 --> 06:35.800]  down the middle of the street you know that's how they used to do it what you don't see in the old
[06:35.800 --> 06:41.320]  western movies is you know that the streets were filled with cow manure and horse manure pig
[06:41.320 --> 06:47.880]  manure and chicken manure and then human manure dumped out of buckets onto the streets you know
[06:47.880 --> 06:52.440]  South Korea is one of the most industrialized nations in the world the most internet connected
[06:53.000 --> 06:59.000]  in the world probably the most technological country next to Japan but they still in many cities
[06:59.000 --> 07:04.360]  dump their feces out of the front of their house you know I hate to be gross about all this but
[07:04.360 --> 07:11.720]  we have a lot of third world populations moving to the United States and I know that there were no
[07:11.720 --> 07:20.440]  leprosy cases until what 2004 and the Associated Press and World Daily both reported 7000 plus
[07:20.440 --> 07:28.040]  wet leprosy that means transferable communicable leprosy cases in 2005 I haven't checked the numbers
[07:28.040 --> 07:34.440]  since then I know the highly communicable drug resistant or drug immune TB is spreading all
[07:34.440 --> 07:38.760]  over the world killing tens of thousands of Americans a year again but the media won't
[07:39.480 --> 07:45.240]  basically advertise this to the public other than hyping up somebody flying on an airplane
[07:45.240 --> 07:51.880]  like it's the lone case and they're so concerned I know a lot of people because I've talked to some
[07:51.880 --> 07:59.880]  of the neuro surgeons some of the brain surgeons here in town and it's the talk amongst the medical
[07:59.880 --> 08:09.080]  community of all several classes of worms eating people's brains and the public is always in denial
[08:09.080 --> 08:15.560]  about this you know it's kind of like there's a certain type of maggot certain type of larval
[08:15.560 --> 08:25.320]  fly that does eat live meat and you know the screw worm is just one of a whole class of them
[08:26.200 --> 08:32.280]  and the screw worm where they where they basically tie down the world war two Korean and
[08:32.280 --> 08:38.600]  Vietnam vets in Kansas City at one big VA it was in the Kansas City Star a bunch and some other
[08:38.600 --> 08:47.400]  VAs in Michigan I saw in New York that this particular fly goes up the nose and lays eggs
[08:47.400 --> 08:52.200]  in the sinus and then maggots eat the brain and every time I say that people post it on YouTube
[08:52.200 --> 08:58.840]  the audio and then also I'm a liar oh okay if you don't know how to google veterans die in hospital
[08:58.840 --> 09:04.280]  of maggots then I can't help you now I mean if you want to just say I'm making that up go ahead
[09:04.280 --> 09:10.280]  but it'd be better to just clean up the VA with the rats and the flies and all the rest of it
[09:12.360 --> 09:21.080]  yes it's true that you know most fly larva varieties do not eat live flesh
[09:24.200 --> 09:30.360]  okay but they can go into scruffulous tissue and cause a larger infection and some of the deaths
[09:30.360 --> 09:38.840]  with the flies entering the sinus were of varieties not known to eat live flesh
[09:40.040 --> 09:43.400]  now you're saying why am I getting into this I have all this other important news here in front
[09:43.400 --> 09:50.200]  of me well you know I have a Fox News report I have a BBC News report it's finally hitting the news
[09:50.200 --> 09:55.800]  but they won't tell you what this is these are imported pigs out of Mexico
[09:55.800 --> 10:04.600]  because in Mexico they feed the pigs on fresh human feces I know you don't like to hear that
[10:04.600 --> 10:10.200]  but you should know what you're eating now it's true you feed a pig healthily and you feed it
[10:10.200 --> 10:16.760]  fresh slop you know watermelon rinds and things like that you'll trash out of the house when it's
[10:16.760 --> 10:27.400]  fresh and you you you worm the the the pigs the hogs you can eat them but you know what I've cut
[10:27.400 --> 10:33.000]  back over the years eating meat you know regardless the way the system is now I'll still eat a big
[10:33.000 --> 10:41.080]  beef steak occasionally but I'm just never eating pork again I was eating a pork from this
[10:41.080 --> 10:48.200]  from this Cuban restaurant down the street pork sandwich they I had a bad feeling eating it
[10:50.360 --> 10:55.320]  and you know because I know I mean you know there's a reason the bible people make fun of it but
[10:55.320 --> 11:02.840]  there's a reason Leviticus where the law says wash your hands and it says don't eat pig don't
[11:02.840 --> 11:09.640]  eat pork because not just the trichinosis the trichinosis worm there's a bunch of other worms
[11:09.640 --> 11:15.880]  and pigs are very similar to us most zoological infestations can't transfer from other animals
[11:15.880 --> 11:23.080]  to humans but with pigs they readily do okay that's the big issue here if you study zoological
[11:23.080 --> 11:31.960]  infestations and people will keep living in denial about this there are thousands of cases
[11:31.960 --> 11:37.160]  of this a year alone and the media knew that in the report they just talk about well this
[11:37.160 --> 11:41.560]  particular brain surgeon seen him you know four or five of these this year and all his colleagues
[11:41.560 --> 11:50.600]  have seen him too well yeah and they're killing people so without further ado this is what becoming
[11:50.600 --> 11:58.200]  a third world nation means okay and I mean if you take for granted not having liver flukes or
[11:58.840 --> 12:04.280]  not having brain worms then go ahead and laugh at me and let's just have everybody from the
[12:04.280 --> 12:09.640]  third world in here now I don't blame him wanting to come here you know I happen to know that around
[12:09.640 --> 12:17.800]  10 of the children in Mexico City die of parasites by age five I had to know that one third of the
[12:17.800 --> 12:24.200]  children born in Mexico City are born with a one particular disorder of having a tiny fractional
[12:24.200 --> 12:29.160]  brain their brains about six seven eight percent of its normal size they're complete vegetables the
[12:29.160 --> 12:34.440]  children just die that's all the toxic waste from the US being dumped down there and that's a great
[12:34.440 --> 12:42.280]  crime I'm just telling you folks that that's what we're turning into here and so well I mean here
[12:42.280 --> 12:51.000]  it is the the brain eating worms mainstream news rose mary alvarez savers every minute with her
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.960]  kids playing ball and laughing for this mom each day with them as a gift after coming too close to
[12:57.960 --> 13:04.680]  death last august I thought I had the flu I started feeling tired but within days this soccer coach
[13:04.680 --> 13:12.040]  and pta president knew it wasn't the flu I started feeling numbness in my my left arm blurred vision
[13:12.040 --> 13:17.960]  I'm still smiling for my kids but now I can't get out of bed two trips to the ER solved nothing
[13:17.960 --> 13:23.240]  cat scan came back normal no problem but her husband george was scared she couldn't eat she
[13:23.240 --> 13:28.040]  could barely walk to the bathroom so I knew at that point you know she was deteriorating really
[13:28.040 --> 13:32.920]  quick it all came to a head on the first day of school as their kids age nine through seventeen
[13:32.920 --> 13:38.840]  headed back to the classroom their mom was in an ambulance headed to baro neurological hospital
[13:38.840 --> 13:47.240]  after an MRI explained those strange symptoms it came back you have a brain tumor at that exact moment
[13:47.240 --> 13:54.040]  where my heart fell just completely all the way down but the news would get worse neurosurgeon
[13:54.040 --> 13:59.560]  dr peter nikaji once we saw the MRI would realize this is not good it's something down in her brain
[13:59.560 --> 14:05.240]  stem which is as deep into the the brain as you can be george broke the news to the kids it was a
[14:05.240 --> 14:09.000]  rough day because it was the first day at school and they came home with all their stuff from school
[14:09.000 --> 14:15.080]  and all the stuff to sign and look what I got from my teacher and where's mom and what's mom well
[14:15.080 --> 14:20.920]  mom's in the hospital and this is what happened as rosemary waited for surgery she worried oh my god
[14:20.920 --> 14:28.360]  we just canceled our insurance like three weeks ago and now this happens and mostly where how are
[14:28.360 --> 14:35.160]  we gonna pay for this and she prayed okay god if you're gonna take me take me but make sure
[14:35.800 --> 14:41.640]  my kids are good by the time the surgery got underway all those pta moms and neighbors her
[14:41.640 --> 14:47.240]  kids they were all praying too my girlfriend she goes everybody's calling saying they're praying for
[14:47.240 --> 14:53.080]  you they're praying for you church they're going to church and they're having the mass pray for you
[14:54.200 --> 15:01.640]  power of prayer that's what i told them power of prayer it worked dr nikaji was expecting to
[15:01.640 --> 15:08.040]  find a brain tumor he showed me the video as he operated on rosemary's brain carefully working
[15:08.040 --> 15:14.360]  knowing this is the most dangerous spot in the human body to work next to the brainstem here's
[15:14.360 --> 15:19.400]  the lump and at this point it still looks like a a brain tumor and so we're just opening up
[15:20.280 --> 15:30.040]  into the inside and then the unexpected no tumor instead a worm watches dr nikaji grabs the worm
[15:30.040 --> 15:37.240]  and gently tugs it out of rosemary's brain it's still alive you don't hear him on the tape but
[15:37.240 --> 15:42.600]  nikaji actually chuckles which i'm sure is a very strange response for the people in the operating
[15:42.600 --> 15:48.120]  room but because uh i was so pleased to know that it wasn't going to be something terrible this worm
[15:48.120 --> 15:53.160]  comes from eating undercooked pork but more frighteningly it can be spread by people who
[15:53.160 --> 15:58.360]  have the parasite in their bodies and don't wash their hands well after using the bathroom
[15:58.920 --> 16:04.760]  that is the problem and it only takes one person who um you know is spreading it constantly to get
[16:04.760 --> 16:10.200]  a lot of people exposed and some of those people are going to go on to develop this problem it's
[16:10.200 --> 16:15.320]  impossible to pinpoint exactly when rosemary contracted this brain worm probably she was
[16:15.320 --> 16:22.360]  one of these very unfortunate people uh who had somebody handle food for her uh that she ingested
[16:22.360 --> 16:28.200]  it and uh it got to her brain what is normally a rare occurrence has become much more common
[16:28.200 --> 16:33.720]  dr nikaji has removed five of them in the past few months and other doctors at barrow they're
[16:33.720 --> 16:39.000]  seeing more of them too i think it could be a fluke but it does concern me that if we see more
[16:39.000 --> 16:45.080]  and more cases uh as one person is infected and starts to spread these it spreads it to other
[16:45.080 --> 16:49.720]  people who become infected and then they spread it all right stay there let's come back now a lot
[16:49.720 --> 16:55.640]  of times these kill you now do they tell you in this newscast where it's coming from absolutely
[16:55.640 --> 17:11.560]  not our precious little neighbor to the south
[17:26.440 --> 17:35.560]  that's right the police all over the nation are viciously writing and cps kidnapping
[17:35.560 --> 17:41.800]  amish and men and i children they're resting amish and men and i it's for selling each other milk
[17:44.120 --> 17:50.680]  they're arresting people for selling eggs people that have watermelon stands
[17:50.680 --> 17:59.480]  but you want to ship a bunch of pigs in here full of brain eating worms you go ahead and you do it
[18:03.560 --> 18:08.120]  it's all part of the curse of evil there's nothing even mystical about it
[18:13.320 --> 18:18.440]  simple you get a society of a backstabbing greedy scum that only care about themselves
[18:18.440 --> 18:23.400]  but nobody cares about anybody else and everything goes to hell in a hand basket
[18:23.400 --> 18:30.280]  who wants to live in a world like that you know i mean i mean i have never wantonly
[18:30.280 --> 18:37.320]  cheated or screwed somebody even when people have done things bad to me i have a restraint
[18:37.320 --> 18:46.920]  doing things back bad to them because i found uh the providence uh what's the what the greeks call
[18:46.920 --> 18:56.440]  that the logos uh what comes around goes around reap what you so that uh evil comes back on those
[18:56.440 --> 19:05.800]  that do evil and so i fear god i fear the spirit of the universe righteousness uh but but it's more
[19:05.800 --> 19:13.160]  than that i don't do good because i even fear god that's only one level of it it's because it's i am
[19:13.160 --> 19:19.240]  trying to be a good person i am walking in goodness does that mean i don't flux back and forth into
[19:19.240 --> 19:24.920]  evil no i'm a fallen creature but i know what feels right in my soul i know what my conscience
[19:25.480 --> 19:33.000]  tells me is good i know the dark volcanic festian
[19:33.000 --> 19:45.960]  founts of evil i know what that side is like i've experienced the dark side and it just can't even
[19:47.720 --> 19:56.760]  hold a candle pun intended to the light but i don't seek after the light because it's great power
[19:56.760 --> 20:02.520]  i seek after goodness because it is what fulfills me it is what i was meant from the formation of
[20:02.520 --> 20:10.120]  my soul of my mother's womb to forever be with it is what i'm attracted to
[20:13.240 --> 20:25.000]  well the world is in darkness thrall it is held in the sway of the wicked and you cannot deny that
[20:25.000 --> 20:34.360]  you cannot deny that and so you're gonna have worms eat your brains and you're going to live
[20:34.360 --> 20:41.640]  in denial about it i mean there are people on these bbc and fox news clips saying it's not true
[20:42.280 --> 20:48.680]  there's people saying there aren't trichinosis worms in port and so one guy'll pour alcohol or
[20:48.680 --> 20:55.480]  or coca-cola whatever the reason coca-cola does that is it has carbon dioxide on it and the worms
[20:55.480 --> 21:02.280]  can't breathe they put a little snout up that's why they swim out of the raw port pork cuts
[21:02.920 --> 21:09.800]  it's not pork sausage that chops them up unless it's their eggs and so you know one group there's
[21:09.800 --> 21:13.400]  thousands of these tests on youtube hundreds of millions of views it's gotta be because there's
[21:13.400 --> 21:17.640]  thousands of these videos some of them have millions of views tens of millions bare minimum
[21:17.640 --> 21:23.080]  and it shows people pouring coke or alcohol whatever you know keeps oxygen from on these big
[21:23.080 --> 21:28.600]  slabs of pork steaks and out come the worms and and people are going oh that's fake there's no
[21:28.600 --> 21:34.680]  worms in there there's comments like the government wouldn't allow that hey jackass let me tell you
[21:34.680 --> 21:41.560]  something okay people are dying in every major town and even small towns every day tens of thousands
[21:41.560 --> 21:49.480]  die of drug-resistant tb every year and it's growing exponentially we got leprosy now in this country
[21:51.000 --> 21:56.840]  and we got brain eating worms all over the place and that's only one of hundreds of different
[21:56.840 --> 22:04.360]  types of parasites so we all need to be dewormed especially we've been eating fast food prepared
[22:04.360 --> 22:12.280]  by third world people because it isn't just enough that it comes in in the third world pork
[22:13.640 --> 22:15.320]  there's some parasites in chicken
[22:18.600 --> 22:24.680]  that isn't bad enough it's that the third world people they are host for it and they don't wipe
[22:24.680 --> 22:30.200]  their hands properly and they come and put your taco together or your hamburger together your hot
[22:30.200 --> 22:36.200]  dog together or your dinner together and then you eat that and then you die by the way most of the
[22:36.200 --> 22:42.120]  time the worms end up dying in your brain and then you get diagnosed with Parkinson's or you
[22:42.120 --> 22:46.760]  know they say you had brain tumors and then they don't identify that it's the worms they're covering
[22:46.760 --> 23:02.680]  up the worms i've been telling you about them for a decade
[23:04.920 --> 23:08.680]  in constant sorrow
[23:08.680 --> 23:18.600]  this day
[23:19.240 --> 23:22.600]  i've seen trouble all my day
[23:22.600 --> 23:34.120]  my day i'm a bit fair way i remember back in well was it 1997
[23:38.680 --> 23:40.920]  thousands of us school children
[23:43.880 --> 23:46.360]  believe it was six thousand i'm going from memory god
[23:46.360 --> 23:56.760]  that hepatitis from berries strawberries raspberries bought in bulk by the us school lunch program the
[23:56.760 --> 24:07.480]  feds bought it in bulk it all been sprayed in fresh not processed human feces and then it
[24:07.480 --> 24:14.040]  was frozen shortly out of the fields and then brought and then unfrozen with the you know
[24:14.040 --> 24:18.840]  you know fresh hepatitis for the children and nothing happened they have multi-billion dollar
[24:18.840 --> 24:23.640]  funds to quietly pay that off and then their answer is well we'll just vaccinate all of you with a
[24:23.640 --> 24:31.640]  deadly smallpox or excuse me uh you know hepatitis vaccine uh that will keep you safe from all of
[24:31.640 --> 24:42.840]  this it's the same story oh the estrogen mimicking endocrine disruptors leaching out of the plastic
[24:42.840 --> 24:47.960]  instead of changing the plastic we use for everything there's hundreds of different
[24:47.960 --> 24:53.080]  mixtures that don't leach it we just so happen to accidentally choose the one that does i'm sure
[24:53.080 --> 24:59.080]  it's an accident everything seems to sterilize instead of you know taking that out that hurts
[24:59.080 --> 25:03.080]  our boys and girls when our boys and girls have hormone problems you know when five-year-old
[25:03.080 --> 25:10.040]  girls go into puberty or boys basically turn into women they say oh we'll just give you
[25:10.040 --> 25:16.920]  hormones to fix it to mask the other hormones that are leaching out of the plastics and oh
[25:16.920 --> 25:24.040]  we won't tell you to not eat pork we won't tell you to uh you know have a ban on imported pork
[25:24.040 --> 25:31.720]  out of mexico filled with trichinosis as if it's not here now no we'll just let you have brain
[25:31.720 --> 25:37.320]  surgery and you know it'll go to your brainstem and if she waited a few more days it'll kill her
[25:37.320 --> 25:43.160]  you know now she has trouble standing and walking and you know her head's numb but
[25:45.480 --> 25:48.200]  you know there's no discussion of why she got a brain any worm
[25:50.440 --> 25:54.520]  finish up the end of that clip we were right at the end let's finish the last part of that clip
[25:55.560 --> 26:02.920]  so that uh more people are at least at risk meantime george and rosemary are stunned relieved
[26:02.920 --> 26:07.880]  and a bit creeped out by it all it could have eight holes in her brain like a apple this whole part
[26:07.880 --> 26:15.320]  of my head from here to here it's it's numb i i just learned to live with it rosemary shows off
[26:15.320 --> 26:22.040]  the scars i had to learn to walk to balance but rosemary says the most important thing she learned
[26:22.040 --> 26:29.080]  is how to really live i was so busy in life with everything else and sometimes telling my kid okay
[26:29.080 --> 26:35.320]  i'll be right there i'll be right there or or hold on and and no i can't right now or no i'm
[26:35.320 --> 26:40.840]  i'm coming i'll be right there i'm not going to miss a moment that we tell me what's on your mind
[26:40.840 --> 26:45.480]  it strengthened us again because we almost we almost lost everything everything fell apart
[26:45.480 --> 26:49.960]  when she was gone everything fell apart and my kids saw how important their mother was
[26:49.960 --> 26:53.960]  in the house because even they were you know starting to take mom for granted and pulled her
[26:53.960 --> 26:57.880]  out of the whole system and everything just crumbled they hope everyone learned something
[26:57.880 --> 27:02.920]  from this story so no one else has to go through what rosemary did wash your hands
[27:05.240 --> 27:11.960]  wash your hands you know wash your hands i mean what a nice lady and you know what a sweet story
[27:11.960 --> 27:17.320]  and absolutely you know family is first it is important and we shouldn't get caught up in tv
[27:17.320 --> 27:23.480]  and football and the sick beast culture and all the distractions and fashion and and but at the
[27:23.480 --> 27:29.080]  same time uh you should be angry you should ask why are there brain eating worms spreading all over
[27:29.800 --> 27:34.440]  you know one hospital is now seeing them everywhere people coming in and droves with
[27:34.440 --> 27:43.240]  brain eating worms and people are posting on the story that it's not true they are willfully
[27:43.240 --> 27:48.040]  in denial just like when the mainstream news admits yes we're setting up world government
[27:48.040 --> 27:58.920]  we've been setting it up covertly it is tyrannical and people then go into the times of
[27:58.920 --> 28:04.600]  london the financial times of london article and post comments saying it isn't real because
[28:04.600 --> 28:15.320]  they believe in magical thinking they believe that if they just say that it doesn't exist it
[28:15.320 --> 28:23.080]  doesn't and they're following an older version and a a a a older download you know kind of like
[28:23.080 --> 28:30.920]  a windows 98 uh of the new world order where it doesn't exist you're insane if it says it exists
[28:30.920 --> 28:36.120]  there's no such thing as world government i mean i remember limbaugh 15 years ago saying the cfr
[28:36.120 --> 28:43.400]  didn't exist now he'll say oh they don't run anything it's just a debating club but how many
[28:43.400 --> 28:48.200]  of you out there raise your hands i see hands going up everywhere everybody i know who was a
[28:48.200 --> 28:53.800]  you know mainline talk radio listener heard him say does not exist shot handy plays helicopters in
[28:53.800 --> 29:01.960]  the background says it doesn't exist still it's a sick joke is what it is ladies and gentlemen
[29:04.360 --> 29:11.080]  by the way we're going to be going live at 12 20 today after our first guest
[29:11.080 --> 29:20.520]  is on the show we're going to be going live after sandy rosenthal uh is on with us today
[29:24.040 --> 29:25.240]  and then from
[29:28.280 --> 29:33.000]  20 into the next hour to the end of the hour before our next guest joins us new jersey
[29:33.000 --> 29:41.720]  detective 911 first responder detective john carol i want to try to do some justice live on
[29:41.720 --> 29:50.280]  prison planet dot tv where they building seven special report now i just decided to do this
[29:51.560 --> 29:58.920]  this morning and the problem is that there are literally hundreds of clips and right now we're
[29:58.920 --> 30:05.880]  trying to assemble just five or six that we have in the constraints you know dealing with time
[30:11.480 --> 30:19.800]  so right now uh why do i bring this up there has been a big new development a huge development
[30:20.600 --> 30:26.600]  on the building seven case and so often these big developments but this is one of the biggest if
[30:26.600 --> 30:35.000]  not the biggest ever this this rival silverstein hidden in plain view 2002 america rebuilds
[30:40.360 --> 30:48.120]  actor spacey up there narrating it saying that they made the decision
[30:50.520 --> 30:54.520]  to pull the building and then gave the order and watched it come down and pull it means just
[30:54.520 --> 31:01.240]  just imploded controlled demolition and then we have all these other firefighters and police
[31:03.320 --> 31:07.000]  on mainstream news saying get back we're bringing the building down they're going to blow it up
[31:07.720 --> 31:12.520]  then we have all these firefighters and police at emt's on records separate who were there and
[31:12.520 --> 31:18.920]  heard the countdown to blow up building seven then we have all the witnesses who heard it on cbs
[31:18.920 --> 31:25.320]  and abc radio i heard it because i was going to get a pizza i've been on air from nine a.m in the
[31:25.320 --> 31:37.640]  morning after it happened until two o'clock when my show went off and then i ran to mr gatties to
[31:37.640 --> 31:47.320]  get a pizza and i remember flipping around between local news stations texas news stations
[31:47.320 --> 31:55.000]  at five o'clock in the afternoon when they blew it up it was 4 30 something here central
[31:55.560 --> 32:00.280]  and i remember hearing i'm going now now the solemn brothers building seven they don't want to
[32:00.280 --> 32:04.040]  damage other buildings so they're gonna they're gonna have a controlled demolition of the building
[32:04.040 --> 32:08.680]  and i've begged listeners that work at cbs radio news at the time i know that's now basically
[32:08.680 --> 32:14.200]  defunct abc news radio it's still around people heard it on mpr i didn't hear that others reported
[32:14.200 --> 32:20.040]  it too you'll find those tapes i don't have the energy the time the staff well people have found
[32:20.040 --> 32:26.920]  some more of that stuff i'm just gonna leave it at that until later in the next hour radio tv you
[32:26.920 --> 32:31.800]  name it folks they blew the thing up i mean they said they blew it up on tv they said they're gonna
[32:31.800 --> 32:37.480]  blow it up and then they blew the thing up and then you could ask why they blew it up all day long
[32:37.480 --> 32:41.480]  the point is they then lied about it and said they didn't blow it up and there needs to be a major
[32:41.480 --> 32:48.600]  investigation about this and every time we bring out a new video you know we post right off america
[32:48.600 --> 32:59.240]  rebuilds vhs tape bought from pbs the clip of silverstein saying they blew up building seven
[33:00.600 --> 33:08.760]  and people at first said we were lying it was a fake video we show videos of cops saying
[33:08.760 --> 33:11.800]  get back we're bringing the building down they're brought they're blowing it up
[33:11.800 --> 33:14.680]  people say it's fake then later they're forced to admit it's real
[33:17.720 --> 33:23.640]  and then try to poo poo it uh then we have the bbc reporting on two different bbc channels the
[33:23.640 --> 33:30.360]  exact same minute the exact same words the same script see when it's simultaneous on bbc 24 and
[33:30.360 --> 33:38.520]  bbc world when it's simultaneous same minute on the two bbc channels the news channels
[33:39.800 --> 33:46.040]  simultaneously saying the exact same words it wasn't one reporter screwing up we said somebody gave
[33:46.040 --> 33:53.800]  them a script early if it's bbc it was probably roiders roiders is basically run by mi6 and cia
[33:53.800 --> 34:01.560]  2 years after that the bbc admits that roiders did give them the mistake that the building
[34:01.560 --> 34:10.760]  had fallen into its own footprint 25 minutes early now cnn and fox also reported the same
[34:10.760 --> 34:15.400]  thing they were all getting the same false scripting feed that is confirmed
[34:15.400 --> 34:23.320]  that is on record
[34:26.040 --> 34:29.320]  for anybody that cares
[34:34.600 --> 34:38.600]  and i just i start thinking about just how hardcore this is i up
[34:38.600 --> 34:47.160]  i was so upset by this last night when i saw this latest clip
[34:48.520 --> 34:51.640]  that i tried to go to bed at like 10 because i've been under the weather
[34:52.200 --> 34:55.800]  and i rolled around a bed for hours so i got up did more research for hour after hour
[34:55.800 --> 35:02.040]  didn't think to do a special till this morning and um
[35:02.040 --> 35:11.640]  um i just started thinking about just how evil the people are that run our society
[35:12.200 --> 35:17.480]  i mean they really did carry out the attacks they really did stage 9 11 i mean it's a fact
[35:20.280 --> 35:21.480]  they really did do this
[35:25.880 --> 35:30.920]  and god knows what they'll do next i mean we know they're financially robbing us and looting
[35:30.920 --> 35:36.440]  us with financial terrorism stealing 8.5 trillion in eight weeks and we and counting we don't know
[35:36.440 --> 35:41.000]  in the last two weeks what else they've stolen you know that's the latest numbers uh they just
[35:41.000 --> 35:45.080]  don't care about society you know they'll let pork in filled with worms that eats the public's
[35:45.080 --> 35:50.680]  brains they'll let tuberculosis spread everywhere they'll uh you know put sodium fluoride in the
[35:50.680 --> 35:55.880]  water they'll put mercury in the shots and tell the public with total disdain and contempt that
[35:55.880 --> 36:03.560]  mercury's good for your brains and the public will sit there begging for it saying yes we
[36:03.560 --> 36:08.200]  want to believe the lie we want to believe the government we want to go along with whatever
[36:08.200 --> 36:14.280]  you say and with and with whatever you do
[36:18.840 --> 36:23.720]  and this newest clip is just completely and totally blown me away
[36:23.720 --> 36:31.160]  because it it's just confirmed over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[36:31.160 --> 36:36.040]  and over again that the federal government blew up building seven it was a spook based
[36:36.040 --> 36:43.640]  cia fbi all based in it and the fbi and the local new york cops they all know their bosses did it
[36:43.640 --> 36:48.440]  and most of them still just keep their mouths shut because they're scared for their jobs
[36:48.440 --> 36:53.240]  hell we don't have any future with people like this in control if you don't speak out
[36:53.240 --> 36:59.320]  and get involved and i just don't even know what to say anymore i mean we're in deep
[36:59.880 --> 37:03.800]  deep trouble because it's not a big deal for governments to kill three thousand of their
[37:03.800 --> 37:09.400]  own people and they do that throughout history but to do it in such a spectacular arrogant over
[37:09.400 --> 37:23.880]  the top the uh you know fashion just shows amazing will amazing will
[37:26.280 --> 37:32.200]  so we've got a big announcement on building seven coming up at the bottom of the next hour
[37:32.760 --> 37:36.760]  maybe earlier if they're able to get all the clips you guys have all the video clips i sent
[37:36.760 --> 37:43.240]  you in there is that all going well because we're on the clock are you getting all those clips that
[37:43.240 --> 37:51.640]  were sent to you so you were already aware of it okay i'm just having to direct from in here
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.800]  and then that's the problem there's there's hundreds of these and i want to play some of the
[37:57.800 --> 38:08.200]  previous clips and some of the key evidence of building seven first and then get to the new clip
[38:08.440 --> 38:18.200]  clips because it's just all taken together there is no doubt and then people go okay well they blew
[38:18.200 --> 38:22.760]  up building seven big deal they had to do it to save other buildings oh while it's on fire they go
[38:22.760 --> 38:27.880]  in and they plan all these explosives to blow up a 47 story building that would take weeks for top
[38:27.880 --> 38:33.720]  companies to do and then most companies couldn't do this precision they tried to blow up the
[38:38.600 --> 38:47.880]  big computer building they built here in austin a decade ago that they never finished because of
[38:47.880 --> 38:52.600]  the dot-com bust and it was only what a 10 story building and they had a company out there for months
[38:52.600 --> 38:57.400]  of them they tried to detonate it and blow the building up they couldn't even do it they didn't
[38:57.400 --> 39:02.360]  even fall because that happens about a third of the time but not building seven that was done with
[39:02.360 --> 39:10.200]  total freefall symmetrical precision a very professional job brought to you by the folks
[39:10.200 --> 39:16.280]  that can shoot cruise missiles down the chimney or land a tiny spacecraft on the moon or land
[39:16.280 --> 39:23.080]  f-18s on the deck of a carrier yeah that's who it was brought to you by wasn't brought to you by
[39:23.080 --> 39:31.640]  guys in a cave on walkie-talkies i'll assure you of that and it was done to wage war on you so
[39:31.640 --> 39:36.600]  they could have the financial theft they're having now that's only one of the latest salvos of many
[39:36.600 --> 39:48.360]  to come so i'm sorry to uh have to uh report this to you but when you're in a society run by evil
[39:48.360 --> 39:53.000]  there's no into it once you decide nobody else counts once you decide you're out for number one
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.800]  and that's all that matters once you decide you'll cut any corners well everybody else starts doing
[39:57.800 --> 40:05.160]  that and you fall apart like north korea or mexico and that's what's happening to the united states
[40:05.160 --> 40:11.880]  the wages of sin are death a penalty for sin is death and you could say again cut religion out of
[40:11.880 --> 40:19.880]  it what is sin sin is cheating somebody sin is lying sin is doing things that are bad for your
[40:19.880 --> 40:25.880]  body you smoke three packs of cigarettes a day you're gonna get lung cancer you go out and you

[41:49.880 --> 41:56.600]  take this seriously as it really is i mean i catch myself now i hear about some new president
[41:56.600 --> 42:04.680]  getting an implantable chip or movie stars all getting uh implantable chips or i
[42:06.760 --> 42:12.600]  you know read about things like that and i'm like oh i've been covering that for 13 years
[42:14.840 --> 42:20.040]  it's not a big deal as prisons move to make prisoners take it as groups as insurance companies
[42:20.040 --> 42:25.880]  move to make Alzheimer's patients take it as not dozens or hundreds but thousands of clubs and bars
[42:25.880 --> 42:33.160]  and exclusive resorts make you get a chip as the inventor of some of the top video games

[42:41.800 --> 42:49.080]  your world of warcraft or whatever people are going to do it just as the enemy said they would use
[42:49.080 --> 42:53.880]  fads and security to drive it see now i should be speaking out against the chip like ever before
[42:53.880 --> 42:57.080]  but i don't even talk about it anymore you ever hear me talk about implantable chips anymore
[42:57.080 --> 43:01.160]  maybe every two or three months i talk about it because i've talked about it and talked about it
[43:01.160 --> 43:05.240]  and talked about it back when everybody laughed at me and said it wasn't coming when i had Pentagon
[43:05.240 --> 43:14.440]  documents like the january 7th 2000 army war college declassified 1985 document where they talked
[43:14.440 --> 43:22.600]  about how they would implant the general public by 2015 with chips 2025 with brain chips by law
[43:22.600 --> 43:30.120]  and how they would use fads to drive it i mean you can't make that stuff up but but there it is
[43:30.120 --> 43:36.680]  happening same thing with this building seven business i mean now the evidence is so overwhelming
[43:36.680 --> 43:41.560]  so over the top that i believe even getting into the physical bombs in the buildings and
[43:41.560 --> 43:45.960]  thermate and the fact that it couldn't collapse i mean that's all fine and dandy physical evidence
[43:45.960 --> 43:51.880]  but what about all of the eyewitnesses the police the firemen they need grand juries to subpoena them
[43:51.880 --> 43:55.320]  of course the feds will kill them as fast as you subpoena them you got to put them in protective
[43:55.320 --> 43:59.720]  custody of course the feds are the ones doing that so they'll give them an fbi ride to hell like
[43:59.720 --> 44:04.120]  they gave terrence yakey in oklahoma city cop of the year when they tortured him to death to find
[44:04.120 --> 44:11.160]  out who else new stuff but uh the point is we got all these firemen and police on video talking
[44:11.160 --> 44:15.240]  about the bombs and the building was blown up and we've i've gone interviewed many of myself you
[44:15.240 --> 44:19.560]  know we'll pick a fireman or cop out find out who they are we'll go to new york interview them
[44:19.560 --> 44:24.440]  put them on the show and do video and the debunkers just go oh that guy's a liar
[44:25.400 --> 44:30.360]  doesn't matter we have deputy fire chiefs and fire chiefs and deputy emergency managers and
[44:30.360 --> 44:34.360]  police on video saying get back they're blowing it up we're silverstein saying it
[44:34.360 --> 44:39.880]  they're still in denial but more and more clips are surfacing and i know i heard those clips on
[44:39.880 --> 44:46.440]  9 11 well some of those clips i heard some of those clips i saw you have now dug them out dig
[44:46.440 --> 44:52.040]  them all out before they shut the web down we've got to expose what these bastards did with 9 11
[44:52.040 --> 44:53.720]  if we're going to save this society
[45:02.440 --> 45:02.760]  now
[45:05.880 --> 45:09.880]  get our guests on at five after i want to come back and finish up with this and then building
[45:09.880 --> 45:13.880]  seven coming up in about 30 minutes and then we got a bunch of other important guests today
[45:13.880 --> 45:25.720]  thanks the great work of my producer erin dykes a lot of the producers away we've got target
[45:25.720 --> 45:29.400]  patent the u.s government's murder of patent coming up and a lot more
[45:35.480 --> 45:42.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[45:42.760 --> 45:54.600]  be he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[45:54.600 --> 46:06.440]  uh
[46:06.440 --> 46:10.040]  in one hour we have detective john carol joining us
[46:12.600 --> 46:16.120]  new jersey detective 9 11 first responder then we've got uh
[46:16.840 --> 46:22.200]  lucredalski with the fbi harassing we are changed now in new york and robert k wilcox
[46:22.200 --> 46:26.920]  author of target patent u.s government colluded with the soviets the nkvd to kill
[46:28.120 --> 46:31.960]  george s patent we already knew that but now they've got the diaries the eyewitnesses it's
[46:31.960 --> 46:36.040]  admitted the one in telegraph even comes right out and says it's an inclusive evidence
[46:37.320 --> 46:43.400]  and why he didn't want 12 000 us soldiers turned over to the soviets to be worked to death and torture
[46:43.400 --> 46:51.240]  but what did kissinger henry kissinger who who even at the time was an aid
[46:52.760 --> 47:02.120]  to a top aide to general dwight d eisenhower and a member of the os s at a very young age
[47:03.320 --> 47:06.840]  along with david rockefeller now they go way back those two boys
[47:06.840 --> 47:13.560]  these military people are dumb animals to be used and basically killed as cannon fodder
[47:14.360 --> 47:23.080]  so see yeah 12 000 farm boys city boys from detroit michigan the plains of central texas
[47:23.080 --> 47:34.360]  let them die our soviet buds want them let them have them and patent you don't like it die sucker
[47:36.920 --> 47:43.240]  we're the us filth bag we're here to destroy america but as long as we wrap ourselves in a flag
[47:43.240 --> 47:49.240]  you'll love it the same kind of people blew up building seven and they think it's real funny
[47:49.240 --> 47:56.280]  they think it's real funny oh yeah they leave 12 000 us po w is in german camps captured by the
[47:56.280 --> 48:01.080]  soviets they let them be sent off to be worked to death and tortured and killed but they wouldn't
[48:01.080 --> 48:09.320]  kill 3 000 of you no they love it the government loves you
[48:12.840 --> 48:15.960]  um i am not going to
[48:15.960 --> 48:21.880]  be labor this i'm just going to let you know it's available
[48:24.920 --> 48:32.520]  a word of the wise is sufficient every time ted gets any buffalos he lets you know about it
[48:32.520 --> 48:36.520]  these are the us mint coins that they've sold out of and they're saying they may not even make
[48:36.520 --> 48:46.920]  any more we know they made a finite amount in 2007 2008 these are 2008 coins there's only 50 of them
[48:48.600 --> 48:54.600]  and they're at the same price they were two weeks ago when gold was over a hundred dollars
[48:54.600 --> 49:00.280]  less than it is now ted's just passing it on with the great position he bought these two weeks ago
[49:00.280 --> 49:09.960]  they just now came in so 50 uh gold buffalos first come first serve at the price of this show
[49:11.000 --> 49:17.400]  but you got to tell them it's the radio offer 800 686 237 and yes he bought gold at 770 about a
[49:17.400 --> 49:23.960]  week and a half ago it's you know eight to 3840 right now up quite a bit uh british sovereign
[49:23.960 --> 49:31.640]  gold coins at 252 a piece those are uncirculated by the way just incredible value and francs at 203
[49:32.360 --> 49:37.720]  most of those are uncirculated as well they have walking liberty half dollars at 840 a piece another
[49:37.720 --> 49:45.480]  great deal on silver half dollars you really can't beat those deals but the buffalos will go quickly
[49:45.480 --> 49:50.680]  so i recommend you call on those quite a deal they're all great deals but the buffalos are just
[49:50.680 --> 49:56.760]  such a handsome coins you're getting in pretty much it melt with the collectible uh value on
[49:56.760 --> 50:04.360]  top of this is the prettiest coin i this is personally my favorite coin um 800 686 2237
[50:04.920 --> 50:10.600]  800 686 2237 in fact i sent one of these to charlie sheen about a month ago
[50:10.600 --> 50:26.920]  as a present for his new child coming along um again 800 686 2237 800 686 2237
[50:27.640 --> 50:30.360]  call today ladies and gentlemen brothers will be there all night
[50:32.360 --> 50:38.920]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[50:38.920 --> 50:42.120]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[50:48.280 --> 50:54.200]  sandy rosenfall the founder of levies done or g is our guest and she had a run in
[50:55.320 --> 51:00.680]  repeatedly uh and they checked the ip addresses first the handles and then the ip addresses
[51:01.320 --> 51:05.240]  uh of the army corps of engineers going on and countering them attacking them
[51:05.240 --> 51:12.040]  um criticizing us citizens now now now now whether you're for against what the army corps did or
[51:12.040 --> 51:16.920]  whether you want to blame the feds of the state i believe there's blame to go all around uh
[51:16.920 --> 51:21.160]  particularly the feds cutting communication lines and blocking aid so they could run everything and
[51:21.160 --> 51:25.320]  then claim that they needed more funding and power later that was really what happened problem
[51:25.320 --> 51:30.920]  reaction solution regardless that's not the issue here it's that the military uh is out
[51:30.920 --> 51:35.720]  propagandizing against the american people more and more these days and they admit that they are
[51:35.720 --> 51:42.920]  doing this and they're quite proud of this uh sent com north com uh and it's all part of the
[51:42.920 --> 51:47.400]  white house buying fake news propaganda packages and that's going to continue under obama so i
[51:47.400 --> 51:53.000]  wanted to get her on uh for just 15 20 minutes or so we appreciate sandy rosenthal from levies.org
[51:53.000 --> 51:57.640]  coming on with us uh sandy out of the gates uh tell us a little bit about the organization and
[51:57.640 --> 52:03.960]  now what you're going through well we are levies.org the only organization in america
[52:03.960 --> 52:09.080]  trying to focus attention on the fact that what happened here in new allen's we were not destroyed
[52:09.080 --> 52:15.560]  by a hurricane it was a flood that ravaged the city and the reality is this is an engineering
[52:15.560 --> 52:21.080]  failure the worst in the world since chernobyl and the corps of engineers is by federal law
[52:21.080 --> 52:27.640]  responsible for that flood protection but right after the storm a disinformation campaign started
[52:27.640 --> 52:34.200]  where the us army corps authorized a million dollar grant for um engineering science society to go
[52:34.200 --> 52:39.560]  out and do a traveling pr show we discovered this in a four year request you've also got the fact
[52:39.560 --> 52:43.640]  that the us army corps investigated their own work after the flooding you investigate yourself
[52:43.640 --> 52:48.840]  what do you think you're going to find and uh as for outside peer review of that investigation
[52:48.840 --> 52:55.160]  the corps gave them um a two million dollars for it and awarded them with medals of honor 18 months
[52:55.160 --> 53:00.120]  before their work was finished but the main message here is that us army corps of engineers from the
[53:00.120 --> 53:05.960]  beginning has been trying to shift blame to the citizens by claiming that the city interfered with
[53:05.960 --> 53:11.000]  their grand plan when that is not the case at all and this is important for your listeners
[53:11.000 --> 53:16.280]  because there's us army corps levies all over the place in all 50 states and they're in bad condition
[53:16.280 --> 53:22.840]  and finally and that's why you have me on today is there's corps employees using corps computers
[53:22.840 --> 53:29.080]  posing as average citizens to pose information and disrupt legitimate discussions with personal
[53:29.080 --> 53:36.440]  attacks on the city there's an unethical use of news and blogs well it certainly is and and
[53:36.440 --> 53:39.560]  again they're not telling people to the army corps of engineers they're acting like they're
[53:39.560 --> 53:44.360]  john cube public and they're doing this from government computers and i think it's clearly
[53:44.360 --> 53:50.200]  part of a larger campaign uh that they're engaged in so specifically break down what happened and
[53:50.200 --> 53:55.160]  how you caught them and now how they're responding since it made uh television sure i'll be happy
[53:55.160 --> 54:01.400]  to tell you um i maintain two blogs and uh i noticed on both of them i've been receiving
[54:01.400 --> 54:07.800]  for years but they've recently stepped up in their um in their frequency um attacks where i
[54:07.800 --> 54:13.080]  essentially um i am aligned uh supporters are aligned citizens are aligned and they're trying to
[54:13.080 --> 54:20.120]  rewrite history they're trying to say that uh local officials you know gotten the way and blocked
[54:20.120 --> 54:26.040]  the army corps plans for the flood protection and i know this is i know it's it's not true i know
[54:26.040 --> 54:32.120]  that they're making up the fact and but as i said i'm used to them but then i i you know it kind of
[54:32.120 --> 54:37.720]  got into my head well gee let me see you know it's kind of like cooking looking at caller id and
[54:37.720 --> 54:43.720]  now the ip address is clearly there uh visible for anyone that wants to look and so all i did
[54:43.720 --> 54:50.120]  was i took that uh caller id essentially and plugged it into a program free on the internet
[54:50.120 --> 54:57.720]  that anyone can access call who is dot net w w dot who is dot net and and i plugged in the ip
[54:57.720 --> 55:02.760]  address that's what it's called in that little box and up came a military address and that's how it
[55:02.760 --> 55:09.320]  all started and and i realized that um that you know immediately that something was very wrong
[55:09.320 --> 55:15.080]  well look they've been sanctioned to do this on my websites info wars dot com prison planet dot
[55:15.080 --> 55:22.440]  com and others uh they don't even hide the fact i mean they come on with their handles and people
[55:22.440 --> 55:27.160]  could say well that's somebody using their handle no then you go to their facebook their myspace or
[55:27.160 --> 55:33.320]  their you know their brigade website whatever they'll be wearing psi off patches and they're
[55:33.320 --> 55:40.040]  really mindless thugs aren't even good spies uh and uh they will be on there you know with all
[55:40.040 --> 55:44.760]  their anti-american rhetoric their anti free speech rhetoric their their talk about how they want
[55:44.760 --> 55:51.000]  to cap us citizens uh so really uh it's a group of brigands i'm not saying our whole military is
[55:51.000 --> 55:57.640]  like that but these these these little special units they've shifted amongst the detritus and found
[55:57.640 --> 56:05.080]  the particularly nasty uh blobs and put them into positions of power and they're just 24 seven
[56:05.640 --> 56:13.880]  attacking basically anybody that criticizes uh anything that uh the foreign banks that own
[56:13.880 --> 56:19.080]  our government are doing well in this case in new orleans and and and in in just 10 seconds i'll
[56:19.080 --> 56:24.520]  explain why it's important to know this but in new orleans you got a federal agency the us army
[56:24.520 --> 56:30.840]  corps responsible for protecting the city and who let the city down to almost near total destruction
[56:30.840 --> 56:36.200]  hiding the identities and posting anonymous comments on news sources blogs and forums to cover
[56:36.200 --> 56:40.920]  their tracks rewrite history and ship the blame for the flooding away from itself and onto the
[56:40.920 --> 56:45.480]  citizens of new orleans now why is that important to your listeners because there's levies in all
[56:45.480 --> 56:51.560]  50 states in bad condition and the us army corps i believe has a lot at stake here and trying to
[56:51.560 --> 56:57.000]  protect their reputation and your listeners all they have to do is go to a website that we created
[56:57.000 --> 57:04.760]  called are we at risk dot org are we at risk dot org and all you have to do a type in your zip code
[57:04.760 --> 57:09.880]  and your listeners can find out if they're at risk at well well i mean obviously flooding happens
[57:09.880 --> 57:14.360]  it's always going to happen and i don't think the army corps of engineers can keep us safe from
[57:14.360 --> 57:18.760]  everything a government big enough to give you anything you want big enough and we'll by the
[57:18.760 --> 57:24.200]  way always take everything away alexa i do need to point out we were not flooded by a by a hurricane
[57:24.200 --> 57:29.960]  we were flooded because of engineering failure uh 53 levy breaches 53 and they were due to
[57:29.960 --> 57:35.160]  engineering failure not just simply no no i'm listening i'm not debating that with you i was
[57:35.160 --> 57:42.360]  talking about the rest of the nation and and i was just stating that the people need to talk to their
[57:42.360 --> 57:46.920]  governments about the double set of books the comprehensive annual financial reports and say
[57:46.920 --> 57:53.400]  look we don't want all that invested in offshore uh hedge funds and derivatives we you know the
[57:53.400 --> 58:00.280]  states uh need to take control and they need to build up the levies all over the mississippi
[58:00.280 --> 58:04.360]  and other major rivers i mean i mean don't you think that's a good idea because i mean the feds
[58:04.360 --> 58:10.200]  just you know they can't help it they're going to always bid rig they're always going to steal uh
[58:10.200 --> 58:14.520]  i mean it's a wicked group they i'm going to answer your question and you asked me if that's a good
[58:14.520 --> 58:19.320]  idea and i'm going to i'm going to tell you what we think uh we think that we don't yet know what
[58:19.320 --> 58:24.440]  happened to these levies in new orleans as long as the investigation was conducted by the organization
[58:24.440 --> 58:27.960]  responsible for its performance because they're involved for cover-up sure and i mean that's a
[58:27.960 --> 58:32.040]  conflict of interest well going back when was the last big flood in new orleans because it was
[58:32.040 --> 58:38.280]  admitted then that they did that the army corps did blow up the levies that time okay uh there's
[58:38.280 --> 58:43.640]  there were two floods that there was one in 1965 and that's when the federal government came in and
[58:43.640 --> 58:50.040]  decided that it would take over our flood protection and and by federal mandate it took the responsibility
[58:50.040 --> 58:55.480]  for building our levies away from us and gave it to uh the u.s army corps and that's all outlined
[58:55.480 --> 58:59.480]  in the flood control but there was one before that where they did blow up the levy that was um
[58:59.480 --> 59:05.640]  you're talking i believe about the flood and uh a flood that occurred in 1927 yeah and that was
[59:05.640 --> 59:12.600]  when the army corps came in and said i mean i'm sorry when the congress came in and um set up a law
[59:12.600 --> 59:18.200]  flood control act of 1928 that says if anything goes wrong with an army corps of engineers flood
[59:18.200 --> 59:22.840]  protection project uh they cannot be sued well i just but i mean that's why people think they
[59:22.840 --> 59:27.560]  blew up the levies this time is because it's on record that the army did blow up the levies to
[59:27.560 --> 59:31.480]  flow the lower areas instead of the richer areas i mean that's admitted that did happen
[59:31.480 --> 59:38.040]  what's admitted oh you're not aware that they blew up the levies back in the 20s oh okay in the 19
[59:38.040 --> 59:42.680]  i i just was asking you what was what you know i forget you know i i knew about it i saw a pbs
[59:42.680 --> 59:47.400]  show about it and memory escapes me but my mother-in-law bought me a Pulitzer prize winning book that
[59:47.400 --> 59:53.880]  came out two years ago about it and and it's it's all about the last flood so you're so you're not
[59:53.880 --> 1:00:00.120]  aware of that okay i i was i was the question i was asking you alex was trying to clarify
[1:00:00.120 --> 1:00:05.320]  what you at what you were asking i'm saying you're aware that they okay there was a explosion if
[1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:09.400]  there the levies were blown up three years ago that's what i thought you were asking me i was
[1:00:09.400 --> 1:00:14.200]  just trying to clarify your question okay i'm talking about the previous time i mean that's
[1:00:14.200 --> 1:00:18.840]  why locals think it did happen three years ago is because it should admit it that it did happen
[1:00:18.840 --> 1:00:26.520]  previous there are some locals who were here um who who didn't know that the flood that the levies
[1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:33.960]  could break and and some some stayed here and they there have been reports that um that they heard
[1:00:34.600 --> 1:00:40.760]  the sound of the levies breaking and and and they've reported that it sounded like they were being
[1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:45.480]  blown up and that's what you're referring to yeah no but but but what i'm referring to i'm just
[1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:50.600]  asking you as a poll okay are you aware that the army corps of engineers admits they blew up the
[1:00:50.600 --> 1:00:57.320]  levies uh previous to that 60 70 years before that i believe that was reported in the book rising
[1:00:57.320 --> 1:01:04.200]  tide by john belly yeah that's right uh that was the the uh the uh book rising tide but but that's
[1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:10.920]  that's not hidden that's not a secret that's correct so i mean they blew it up before to flood
[1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:17.400]  the poor areas and they admitted that that's correct so so that's my point again i i appreciate
[1:01:17.400 --> 1:01:23.320]  you having me on the show um i can only tell you what i know and what i know is that members of the
[1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:29.960]  army corps have hidden their identities uh logged on to their office computers and tried to rewrite
[1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:34.920]  the history of the flooding in new Orleans and and uh there are u.s army corps projects in every
[1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:40.200]  single state of this nation and it's important that you listen to understand that they need to
[1:01:40.200 --> 1:01:44.600]  be vigilant in their in their own part of what have they done since you countered them are they
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:52.680]  distilled the uh the uh initially uh the u.s army corps spokesman issued a statement um saying oh
[1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:59.720]  there are 1600 people at the new Orleans district and um it they considered it an isolated incident
[1:01:59.720 --> 1:02:05.800]  keep in mind that we didn't ever say that this flooding i mean i mean that these uh these remarks
[1:02:05.800 --> 1:02:10.280]  came from the new york district we didn't know where they came from and then three days later
[1:02:10.280 --> 1:02:17.960]  a colonel alvin lee uh uh the head of the new york district issued a personal apology to me
[1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:23.560]  well that's good stay there let's hear more about that and levy's on your website when we get back
[1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:41.240]  the organization
[1:02:53.560 --> 1:03:10.520]  the founder of levies dot or g sandy rosenthal
[1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:17.000]  sandy i totally agree with you about uh the army corps and the shoddy workmanship and the rest of
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:23.160]  it another disinformation campaign against the locals i i know the feds fema came in
[1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:27.640]  and cut the police communications lines that's admitted that's why the cops walked off their
[1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:34.520]  job there was no communication uh i mean it's not just fema and the army corps it looks like uh
[1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:40.040]  not not caring or being a bunch of the phones it it's it looks from every angle like it was
[1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:46.280]  completely malicious i i i wonder why uh whether the whole lot of stake here you have to realize
[1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:52.360]  the u.s army corps of engineers has a tremendous amount of power but in the city of new Orleans
[1:03:52.360 --> 1:04:00.360]  they've had a spectacular failure the whole world saw that failure and so the the u.s army corps of
[1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:06.360]  engineers um is like very likely concerned about losing at least some of that power maybe not all
[1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:12.840]  of it but certainly some of it and uh you need to know that uh this started within weeks of the of
[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:19.640]  the storm the city was not even drained yet and already the department of defense uh donald rumsfeld
[1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:28.040]  uh ordered these investigations i spoke of um and and and and had the with the u.s army corps
[1:04:28.040 --> 1:04:34.360]  of engineers um which i found out through a foyer request already lined up who would do essentially
[1:04:34.360 --> 1:04:39.640]  a pr per campaign for the corps i spoke a few minutes ago about this traveling slideshow
[1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:46.760]  by the american society civil engineers uh the corps paid for that and uh in a grant and the and if
[1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:53.480]  you listen to it or watch it you can immediately see that it was uh the that the role of the
[1:04:53.480 --> 1:04:58.680]  u.s army corps was minimized and the strength of the storm and the vulnerability of the region was
[1:04:58.680 --> 1:05:06.440]  was maximized well uh in closing here how can folks get involved how can they bring justice
[1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:12.600]  to this how can we get the levies properly uh fixed and are you satisfied with the apology from
[1:05:12.600 --> 1:05:19.320]  the colonel uh the the we well okay in answer to your last question am i am i are we satisfied
[1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:26.680]  we uh don't uh we know for a fact that there are more than one people um at the core um
[1:05:27.400 --> 1:05:31.160]  you know hiding the identities and trying to rewrite the story of the flooding
[1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:36.920]  uh and and this uh colonel al lee has only admitted that it's uh the actions of one individual
[1:05:36.920 --> 1:05:42.920]  uh as far as what can your listeners do the absolute number one best thing they can possibly do
[1:05:42.920 --> 1:05:50.760]  is go to excuse me w w dot levies dot org and uh simply join us it's free and all we ask is your
[1:05:50.760 --> 1:05:54.920]  email address and if you don't want to get email alerts just click the little box and let me know
[1:05:56.120 --> 1:06:01.320]  all right well as this develops and if anything else happens please stay in contact and i really
[1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:08.840]  appreciate you um standing up not just for the people of louisiana new orleans uh but also
[1:06:08.840 --> 1:06:15.160]  for the people of the country because the problems with the levies around the nation not even being
[1:06:15.160 --> 1:06:20.920]  repaired uh is obviously a very very serious issue and you're right until we have a true
[1:06:20.920 --> 1:06:26.360]  impartial investigation about levy strengths around the country how can we even set about fixing them
[1:06:26.360 --> 1:06:31.320]  so it's just all part of this uh all part of this uh culture of corruption where things are just
[1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:37.160]  basically falling apart and i promise this is my last sentence that midwest flooding clearly showed
[1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:44.200]  that levy failure in flooding is definitely not a coastal problem no it's a problem everywhere
[1:06:44.200 --> 1:06:48.920]  and flooding has always been a serious problem i mean look at the dutch they didn't decide to just
[1:06:48.920 --> 1:06:55.640]  let the sea win they actually beat the sea and expanded their country uh quite a bit so uh well
[1:06:55.640 --> 1:07:00.600]  listen great having you on with us and we'll talk to you again soon thank you thank you you bet
[1:07:02.200 --> 1:07:06.200]  all right folks when we come back out of break we're going to go live at prisonplanet.tv

[1:07:49.720 --> 1:07:54.840]  deal and then now more evidence has come out stacked on top of evidence and evidence that
[1:07:54.840 --> 1:08:02.760]  the government blew up building seven and uh you know it's it we this is a huge deal so some
[1:08:02.760 --> 1:08:09.960]  big new developments uh that is coming up after this quick break ladies and gentlemen so please

[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  m&m fm dial as well the streams at info wars dot com
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  so
[1:08:45.400 --> 1:08:53.480]  hello my friends it is the 23rd day of december 2008 here in the waning days of 2008
[1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:59.720]  a year where we saw msnbc and the new yorker magazine report that dick cheney according to
[1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:04.520]  whiteout sources planned to stage terror attacks against us ships and straight over moose using
[1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:12.760]  us navy seals dressed up like iranians but the plan was nixed by the pentagon when admiral
[1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:18.920]  fox felon resigned refusing to go along with killing his own sailors and marines
[1:09:18.920 --> 1:09:25.640]  this is the type of issues that we're dealing with here throughout history governments have
[1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:31.800]  staged terror attacks and in the next 30 minutes here at prisonplanet.tv i'm going to break down
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:39.880]  the story of building seven now i think later next week i'm going to do a full hour on this
[1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:44.520]  and really go through the majority of the clips because there are hundreds and we do have time
[1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:55.720]  constraints here but i uh saw a new clip up on prisonplanet.com last night and the story this
[1:09:55.720 --> 1:10:07.080]  morning uh by paul watson and it says uh new york fire department lieutenant admitted plan
[1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:16.200]  to take down building seven now he is on msnbc
[1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:27.880]  and he is in the clip openly saying that building seven has been burning
[1:10:28.760 --> 1:10:35.160]  and uh it may fall on its own but or we may take it down now there's no debating what
[1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:42.360]  we may take it down means now this alone could be uh you know still something to investigate
[1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:48.040]  something very suspicious we never had a modern steel building fall the way tower one two or seven
[1:10:48.040 --> 1:10:55.000]  did tower seven was the 47 story building also owned by selverstein a second largest spook compound
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:05.960]  in the world outside of dc and what happened there what happened with this case well silverstein went
[1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:12.280]  on a program called america rebuilds and says that there had been such a loss of life and
[1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:17.880]  a damage that the fire department made the decision to pull the building and so they gave the order
[1:11:17.880 --> 1:11:25.400]  and watched the building come down they pulled the building and they gave the order to pull it
[1:11:25.400 --> 1:11:29.960]  and watch the building come down now pull it is a demolition term for controlled demolition
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:37.560]  and in the very same documentary uh on pbs 2002 they cut to the next scene and show them
[1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:43.720]  blowing up the wreckage of building six that was still standing even though one of the towers fell
[1:11:43.720 --> 1:11:51.640]  on it uh and they go getting ready getting ready to pull building six and they have a controlled
[1:11:51.640 --> 1:11:56.440]  demolition and then also pull it with cranes the direction they want it to fall so it doesn't damage
[1:11:56.440 --> 1:12:05.880]  other structures now we have videos of firefighters and police saying get back get back they're
[1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:10.760]  getting ready to bring the building down uh then we have eyewitnesses that we've gone firefighters
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:15.480]  emergency workers police officers that say they heard the countdown that they were told to get
[1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:21.640]  back from the building and then i remember going i've been on air all day that day and i remember
[1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:26.840]  rushing up to the local pizza place i've told the story many times to get a pizza take out
[1:12:26.840 --> 1:12:32.200]  and list and flipping between channels during news and hearing cbs radio news i believe now
[1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:37.720]  defunct i never hear it anymore and abc radio news both reporting building seven the solomon's
[1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:42.760]  brother's building they don't want to damage other nearby buildings so they they may bring it down
[1:12:43.800 --> 1:12:47.640]  they may bring it down because see the feds had to put out their story to the police environment
[1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:51.320]  hey don't worry we don't want to damage stuff we're going to bring it down the police environment
[1:12:51.320 --> 1:12:58.440]  didn't ask well takes weeks or months to rig a building properly how are you going to do that
[1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:08.360]  now since then it's come out that fox cnn and bbc all reported in the hour before
[1:13:09.960 --> 1:13:12.600]  building seven fell at five thirty in the afternoon eastern
[1:13:15.880 --> 1:13:21.000]  that the building had fallen due to fires in its own footprint at freefall they got the exact
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:27.080]  script right and bbc simultaneously on both channels said the exact same thing so we said
[1:13:27.080 --> 1:13:34.120]  that's false scripting that's a live video one of them's on a rooftop one of the fellows is on the
[1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:45.400]  street and so i said somebody sent out a news feed that was planted by intelligence we know
[1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:51.720]  intelligence fills the bbc fills roiders fills ap that's it that's been in congressional hearings
[1:13:51.720 --> 1:13:57.240]  back in the 70s somebody planted that story earlier kind of like stories were planted in the
[1:13:57.800 --> 1:14:05.720]  eastern press in in australia new zealand tylin that uh lehar v oswald uh had been caught and had
[1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:11.400]  killed kennedy before he'd even been captured as name released you know it was in newspapers
[1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:15.000]  flutcher proddy always talked about that one of the heads of black ops and the pentagon
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:21.720]  uh so here we had this and then people the the the pentagon debunkers came out and said we made
[1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:33.720]  it up that that was a tape that that was a recording uh on the bbc and then later bbc said no that
[1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:40.760]  was real that was live we just made a mistake so we have all of this and so today i wanted to
[1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:47.320]  to go over some of the clips but but first let's play about five minutes here at prisonplanet.tv
[1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:53.720]  from terror storm it's a two plus hour film and then i produced dealing with the history
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:58.840]  government sponsored terror and we spent just a few minutes on building seven this is a small
[1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:03.640]  part of that and then i want to go back through some of the other clips and the new clip and
[1:15:03.640 --> 1:15:17.640]  why this is such a big deal uh so here's that clip it's amazing amazing incredible pick your word
[1:15:18.520 --> 1:15:24.440]  for the third time today it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television
[1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:29.400]  before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down
[1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:35.560]  we have the owner of the world trade center complex admitting on tape that he ordered
[1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:40.360]  the building demolished on the afternoon of 9 11 i said you know we've had such terrible loss of
[1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:47.080]  life maybe the smartest thing to do is is pull it uh and they made that decision to pull and
[1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:59.960]  then we watched the building collapse during our on the ground investigations in new york city
[1:15:59.960 --> 1:16:05.960]  over the last five plus years we've talked to scores of eyewitnesses who had claimed that police
[1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:11.160]  and firemen told them to get back from building seven because it was going to be brought down or
[1:16:11.160 --> 1:16:17.080]  quote explode building seven while i was listening to live feed from our local public radio station
[1:16:17.080 --> 1:16:22.280]  later in the afternoon they talked about building seven building seven was fine there was no airplane
[1:16:22.280 --> 1:16:27.240]  that hit it and then they even began to ruminate on the air about demolishing the building i said
[1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:32.200]  well i don't know i mean what you can put out fires you know why would you talk about demolishing
[1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:37.000]  a building that you know it's good it wasn't hit by anything you know the fires weren't bad or anything
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:44.200]  like that i will say that i spoke to a cop on 9 11 who said that it was going to come down i don't
[1:16:44.200 --> 1:16:51.400]  know how he knew that now archive cnn footage has surfaced showing video footage of a new york
[1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:56.920]  city police officer telling cameramen and civilians to get back from building seven
[1:16:56.920 --> 1:17:12.840]  because the building was going to blow up
[1:17:12.840 --> 1:17:18.200]  we are looking back
[1:17:26.360 --> 1:17:30.840]  just in the last few seconds another building building number seven one of the buildings
[1:17:31.880 --> 1:17:35.320]  in support of the world trade center towers has collapsed
[1:17:35.320 --> 1:17:46.600]  this is no small building as you can see at 47 stories it would stand out in most american cities
[1:17:51.720 --> 1:18:00.120]  and then in late february of 2007 9 11 researchers reviewing archives of live news coverage from
[1:18:00.120 --> 1:18:06.360]  september 11 discovered to their shock that bbc world had reported that building seven
[1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:11.960]  also known as the salomon brothers building had completely collapsed over 20 minutes before
[1:18:11.960 --> 1:18:19.320]  its actual implosion first anchors at the london news desk reported it now more on the
[1:18:19.320 --> 1:18:23.960]  latest building collapse in new york you might have heard a few moments ago was talking about
[1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:28.600]  the salomon brothers building collapsing and indeed it has apparently that's only a few
[1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:35.320]  hundred yards away from where the they then cut to bbc reporter jane standley in new york who also
[1:18:35.320 --> 1:18:40.680]  reported that the salomon brothers building had fallen all the while with the building clearly
[1:18:40.680 --> 1:18:45.720]  visible behind her through the window our correspondent jane standley jane what more
[1:18:45.720 --> 1:18:51.720]  can you tell us about the salomon brothers building and its collapse well only really
[1:18:51.720 --> 1:18:58.120]  what you already know details are very very sketchy there's almost a sense down town in new york
[1:18:58.120 --> 1:19:03.880]  behind me down by the world trade centers of just an area completely closed off as the rescue
[1:19:03.880 --> 1:19:10.200]  workers try to do their job but this isn't the first building that has suffered as a result
[1:19:10.200 --> 1:19:16.440]  we know that part of the marriott hotel next to the world trade center also collapsed as a result
[1:19:16.440 --> 1:19:23.640]  of this huge amount of falling debris from 110 floors of two the two twin towers of the world
[1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:30.120]  trade center as you can see behind me the trade center appears to be still burning we see these
[1:19:30.120 --> 1:19:37.640]  huge clouds of smoke and ash and we know that behind that there's an empty piece of what was a very
[1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:46.680]  familiar new york skyline another bbc news channel bbc 24 also got the word and reported the
[1:19:46.680 --> 1:19:53.560]  collapsed 20 minutes before it fell enormous building in new york has collapsed it is the 47
[1:19:53.560 --> 1:19:59.480]  story salomon brothers building which was situated very close to the world trade center right there
[1:19:59.480 --> 1:20:05.480]  in this financial capital it then emerged that erin brown of cnn reported from a rooftop over
[1:20:05.480 --> 1:20:10.280]  looking ground zero the building seven had collapsed over an hour before it actually fell
[1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:14.920]  we are getting information now that one of the other buildings building seven
[1:20:14.920 --> 1:20:21.800]  and in the world trade center complex is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing and i i
[1:20:23.160 --> 1:20:26.760]  knew to be honest can see these pictures a little bit more clearly than i
[1:20:27.320 --> 1:20:33.400]  but building number seven one of the buildings in this very large complex of buildings that
[1:20:33.400 --> 1:20:38.040]  is the trade center there were that there were and that is the right way to put it there were
[1:20:38.040 --> 1:20:43.960]  the two towers but then there are a number of support buildings around it and now we are told
[1:20:43.960 --> 1:20:51.320]  that there is a fire there and that building may collapse as well as you can see we can see as we
[1:20:51.320 --> 1:21:00.200]  look now back downtown we can see the billowing smoke cnn and bbc's reports inclusively prove
[1:21:00.200 --> 1:21:05.240]  media prior knowledge and false start scripting of building seven's controlled demolition
[1:21:07.480 --> 1:21:13.240]  couple that with hundreds of police firefighters and rescue workers stating that they were told
[1:21:13.240 --> 1:21:18.360]  to get back from seven because it was going to be brought down there can be no doubt that
[1:21:18.360 --> 1:21:26.120]  building seven's destruction was an orchestrated inside job 9-11 was just one salvo when an
[1:21:26.120 --> 1:21:31.640]  ongoing war against the free peoples of the planet it's all part of their terror storm
[1:21:33.320 --> 1:21:39.000]  all right and i'm gentlemen thank you again for joining us so that's a little bit of background
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:46.600]  there we have scores of police firemen emt's uh video clips audio clips with them saying yeah
[1:21:46.600 --> 1:21:52.440]  they said the building was rigged that the feds were blowing it up uh let's go ahead first though
[1:21:52.440 --> 1:21:58.920]  and play larry silverstein on national tv saying they made the decision to pull it gave the order
[1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:06.440]  and watched it come down before i play you the deputy fire chief this is a new clip live from
[1:22:06.440 --> 1:22:14.520]  the day msnbc that's right but let's play silverstein now here it is i remember getting a call from the
[1:22:14.520 --> 1:22:18.920]  fight upon a commander telling me that they were not sure they're going to be able to contain the fire
[1:22:20.360 --> 1:22:22.520]  i said you know we've had such terrible loss of life
[1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:41.400]  now none of this even gets into the physical evidence the bomb blast the squibs the building
[1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:47.560]  collapsing in on itself in a symmetrical implosion the firefighters on multiple national tv shows
[1:22:47.560 --> 1:22:53.800]  saying they were inside the buildings it was like molten steel was was running only thermate can do
[1:22:53.800 --> 1:22:58.200]  that let's go ahead and play uh that clip of new york fire department personnel staying there was
[1:22:58.200 --> 1:23:04.600]  molten steel then we'll get to the new clip here it is down below and you'd see molten steel
[1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:10.840]  molten steel running down the channel rails like you're in a foundry
[1:23:10.840 --> 1:23:17.640]  and we cut it quickly there because there's been some cussing
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  but again those are you know senior fire department people telling you again the
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:31.320]  temperatures from fires can't do that now without further ado ladies and gentlemen and we have the
[1:23:31.320 --> 1:23:40.280]  name of this fire department commander it's in a story uh fdny lieutenant admitted plan to take down
[1:23:40.280 --> 1:23:51.000]  wtc seven and this was on msnbc and uh his name it's all on record we've got all these other people
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:55.480]  cops and firemen some of them have been killed some of them died mysteriously now that they've
[1:23:55.480 --> 1:24:00.520]  spoken out we hope nothing happens to him he should go public quickly now that we found this
[1:24:00.520 --> 1:24:05.080]  and i'm telling you folks i heard a bunch of other i heard city officials and female officials
[1:24:05.080 --> 1:24:10.600]  on the radio saying they were going to blow it up who's going to go get the abc radio
[1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:15.800]  archives of that day it it's like four o'clock four o'clock central like five o'clock eastern
[1:24:15.800 --> 1:24:19.880]  thirty minutes before they blew it up i'm at mr gattie's getting a pizza i'm flipping around
[1:24:19.880 --> 1:24:24.760]  i'm waiting in the parking lot for the pizza you know i got a little bit early and i'm listening
[1:24:24.760 --> 1:24:30.280]  to radio so i'm gonna run home and do my own radio show and i'm sitting there and i'm hearing
[1:24:30.280 --> 1:24:33.080]  them talk about how they're blowing it up and see that's why i didn't even think about it no
[1:24:33.080 --> 1:24:38.280]  one way they said they blew that up oh shut up conspiracy theorist you didn't hear that on the
[1:24:38.280 --> 1:24:44.840]  radio you didn't hear any of that you understand let's go ahead and play this clip here it is
[1:24:44.840 --> 1:24:49.880]  here's the new clip um in fact you were just uh told by police that you should move out of your
[1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:56.680]  apartment sabiana you've got carolina here um they they advise us to leave because you have
[1:24:56.680 --> 1:25:01.400]  oh my god look behind us please pan in this way please be careful of your baby this is it
[1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:08.120]  that's the building coming down oh my god oh my god oh my god no no we're listen we'll be all right
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:14.520]  we'll be all right we're okay i think we're okay i think we're okay all right we're gonna have to
[1:25:14.520 --> 1:25:18.040]  move this way we're gonna have to move we're gonna have to move that cloud is coming this way yeah
[1:25:18.040 --> 1:25:24.280]  ashley get out of there leave the camera on man if if you uh need to and get out of there
[1:25:25.160 --> 1:25:29.400]  what we've been fearing all afternoon has apparently happened we were watching number
[1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:36.920]  seven world trade which was part of the ancillary damage of the i started this too late we're going
[1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:41.240]  to come back from break and and and play it unedited here because then they go to the fire
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:46.200]  department lieutenant and he says yeah you know they were talking about you know bringing it down
[1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:54.280]  blowing it up and uh you know now i guess that's happened so again this was on npr this was on cbs
[1:25:54.280 --> 1:26:03.240]  this was on uh abc this was on msnbc that's matt lauer and then we have you know we went and
[1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:09.080]  found the cops that are in the video on the ground with amy goodman when they're being told get back
[1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:15.480]  get back amy goodman democracy now she witnessed all of this she's now been forced to admit that
[1:26:15.480 --> 1:26:20.680]  there should be an investigation of seven uh i mean this is incredible folks stay with us
[1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:28.040]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents the alex jones show
[1:26:28.680 --> 1:26:35.800]  because there's a war on for your mind we do this with very heavy hard you know i know the
[1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:40.040]  nine eleven was an inside job i know criminal elements in our government admittedly have staged
[1:26:40.040 --> 1:26:47.960]  over 200 declassified terrorist attacks but it still shook me last night when i saw this newest
[1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:54.680]  clip of hundreds with a new york fire department commander talking about and again it we're not
[1:26:54.680 --> 1:26:58.360]  we're not saying they're complicitant or involved this is the official story they're given oh yeah
[1:26:58.360 --> 1:27:02.360]  it's endangering other buildings we're gonna have to bring it down it may collapse on its own
[1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:08.280]  and we may have to blow it up and then that's what silverstein also says and then you have all the
[1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:13.400]  witnesses to that happening and then you have the deputy head of emergency emergency management
[1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:18.760]  talking about bombs going off in it before tower one or two fell and then he mysteriously dies
[1:27:18.760 --> 1:27:24.440]  quite quickly buried jennings uh so i mean this just gets more and more serious folks we have
[1:27:24.440 --> 1:27:30.920]  all these fire department people all these police on record uh saying that there was a plan to blow
[1:27:30.920 --> 1:27:36.920]  it up and no one asked how was there a plan to blow it up that takes weeks to do and then now
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:41.880]  they say they never said that and we're conspiracy theorist folks it is an inside job it really
[1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:46.440]  happened you think it's fun for me to confront these murderers you think this is a fun job i know who
[1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:52.120]  they are you know i have a lot of courage sometimes i'll wake up three four a.m and it's not even
[1:27:52.120 --> 1:27:57.160]  fear it's more of a a shock it's like oh my god i'm actually fighting these people i'm actually
[1:27:57.160 --> 1:28:02.840]  on the air confronting people that would kill 3 000 people on 9 11 these bastards have to be defeated
[1:28:02.840 --> 1:28:09.240]  my only fear is that we won't be effective now here is the clip this is huge this is matt lower
[1:28:09.240 --> 1:28:15.800]  talking to one of the fire department commanders about the plan to bring down building seven here
[1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:21.640]  it is um in fact you were just uh told by police that you should move out of your um apartment
[1:28:21.640 --> 1:28:28.760]  sabiana you got carolina here um they they advise us to leave because you have oh my god look behind
[1:28:28.760 --> 1:28:35.640]  us please pan in this way please be careful of your baby this is it oh my god oh my god oh my god
[1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:41.640]  no no we're listen we'll be all right we'll be all right we're okay i think we're okay
[1:28:44.440 --> 1:28:47.000]  all right we're gonna have to move this way we're gonna have to move we're gonna have to move that
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:53.560]  cloud is coming this way yeah actually get out of there leave the camera on man if if you uh need
[1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:59.320]  to and get out of there what we've been fearing all afternoon has apparently happened we were
[1:28:59.320 --> 1:29:07.720]  watching number seven world trade which was part of the ancillary damage of the explosion and collapse
[1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:14.120]  of the other two we've been talking all day about how fast these plumes of smoke move you're watching
[1:29:14.120 --> 1:29:22.360]  one on the move right now that is building dust look at the wider shot on the left from across
[1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:29.720]  the river in new york um this was a 40-story building they've been watching all day this is
[1:29:29.720 --> 1:29:37.880]  like watching the collapse of an active volcano and the dust uh from it is is not unlike that from
[1:29:37.880 --> 1:29:44.680]  a volcano we are on the phone with uh new york fire department lieutenant uh david restucio
[1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:50.680]  lieutenant where are you right now i'm at the corner of norm northmore street and granite street
[1:29:50.680 --> 1:29:56.040]  can you confirm it was number seven that just went in yes sir um and you were you guys knew this was
[1:29:56.040 --> 1:30:02.520]  coming all day we had been had we had heard reports that the building was unstable and that
[1:30:02.520 --> 1:30:07.720]  eventually we need to come down on its own or it would be taken down i would imagine it came down
[1:30:07.720 --> 1:30:16.200]  and on its own and uh we are just awaiting now without triage for any other casualties or any
[1:30:16.200 --> 1:30:22.680]  other injuries everybody all right where you are lieutenant very very much so right now all right
[1:30:22.680 --> 1:30:28.680]  back that up about 30 seconds did you hear see they put out the official story early in the day um
[1:30:28.680 --> 1:30:36.600]  in fact because because building building seven for some reason was supposed to go out in the
[1:30:36.600 --> 1:30:41.880]  morning but the plane from pennsylvania something happened it didn't get hit by a plane so they
[1:30:41.880 --> 1:30:47.160]  didn't have that big spectacular but it was still wired was still a spookhouse it was still ready to
[1:30:47.160 --> 1:30:55.240]  go fbi cia all in there so for whatever reason they then tell everybody all day it's gonna come
[1:30:55.240 --> 1:30:58.600]  down it's gonna come down before they're even fires in it they're telling people get out it's
[1:30:58.600 --> 1:31:11.880]  gonna come down we'll be right back stay with us big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[1:31:11.880 --> 1:31:21.160]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin
[1:31:21.160 --> 1:31:31.960]  texas alex jones we are live here at president planet dot tv we have a police detective a survivor
[1:31:31.960 --> 1:31:38.680]  of 9-11 joining us coming out in the next segment then later in the hour lucradowski being harassed
[1:31:39.560 --> 1:31:46.440]  by fbi now for protesting the fact that 9-11's an inside job but what is the system gonna do is
[1:31:46.440 --> 1:31:52.760]  there's hundreds of clips of firemen and police and fire commanders saying yeah they were gonna
[1:31:52.760 --> 1:31:57.560]  blow the building up they were gonna bring it down we were told it would fall on its own
[1:31:57.560 --> 1:32:02.760]  when it had no fires in it then it got them or that we would bring it down so that's in case
[1:32:02.760 --> 1:32:09.080]  it leaked they were planting bombs oh yeah we're bringing it down why did they do that i i don't
[1:32:09.080 --> 1:32:14.440]  know the point is they did blow it up that shows foreknowledge and involvement let's play that clip
[1:32:14.440 --> 1:32:18.440]  this is the new clip and again there's countless other ones out there we just need you to dig
[1:32:18.440 --> 1:32:21.640]  them up and find them because i remember seeing them and hearing them that day i didn't know what
[1:32:21.640 --> 1:32:25.960]  i was seeing though i'm like they're gonna blow up that building that didn't make sense and then
[1:32:26.600 --> 1:32:30.680]  later they say it just fell on its own you kind of forget about it focus on the big towers and then
[1:32:31.480 --> 1:32:38.200]  it comes up and all these disinfo operatives on the web on every issue say we're a liar say it
[1:32:38.200 --> 1:32:43.720]  isn't real or say it isn't true or say bbc didn't report the fall of seven before it fell and then
[1:32:43.720 --> 1:32:50.040]  bbc admits they did and then they come out and attack something new to those government operatives
[1:32:50.040 --> 1:32:54.360]  and i've seen them at ground zero they'll walk right over and you'll be like you're a government
[1:32:54.360 --> 1:32:58.840]  agent aren't you and they're just like we're gonna get you truthers and you can tell some of these
[1:32:58.840 --> 1:33:05.560]  folks are probably involved in it uh it is just truly truly sick as more and more evidence comes
[1:33:05.560 --> 1:33:15.400]  out those that have been camp followers have a cold or minions of this whole thing they
[1:33:17.320 --> 1:33:20.040]  are really going to look bad you're really going to feel bad because now you've made
[1:33:20.040 --> 1:33:24.680]  yourselves complicit in the murder of 3 000 people let's go ahead and finish up with the uh
[1:33:25.560 --> 1:33:31.960]  clip one more time with the uh fire lieutenant talking about how yes we were there was a plan
[1:33:31.960 --> 1:33:36.200]  to bring it down building seven that it was going to fall on its own or we were going to bring it
[1:33:36.200 --> 1:33:41.720]  down here it is norm northmore street and granite street can you confirm it was number seven that
[1:33:41.720 --> 1:33:48.360]  just went in yes sir um and you were you guys knew this was coming all day we had been had we had
[1:33:48.360 --> 1:33:53.560]  heard reports that the building was unstable and that it eventually would either come down on its own
[1:33:54.440 --> 1:34:00.600]  or it would be taken down i would imagine it came down and on its own and uh we are just
[1:34:00.600 --> 1:34:07.080]  awaiting now without triage for any other casualties or any other injuries everybody
[1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:13.880]  all right so there you have it again confirmed by silverstein by firefighters senior firefighters
[1:34:14.600 --> 1:34:21.640]  by all these people that building seven there was a plan to bring it down and what did larry
[1:34:21.640 --> 1:34:26.760]  silverstein say let's play that clip one more time there had been such a great loss of life
[1:34:26.760 --> 1:34:31.160]  that we made the decision to pull it and so we gave the order and watched it come down pull it
[1:34:31.160 --> 1:34:35.640]  demolition term for control demolition we gave the order to pull it and then watch the building
[1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:40.440]  come down i mean what does that mean to you and then you see the building with the blast points
[1:34:40.440 --> 1:34:45.560]  and the rest of it and all of it happening here it is i remember getting a call from the uh fight
[1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:49.720]  upon a commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire
[1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:56.280]  as you know we've had such terrible loss of life maybe this one of the things to do is pull it
[1:34:57.560 --> 1:35:01.880]  and they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse
[1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:12.600]  so what happens is as we get dozens and dozens and dozens of more clips every year of firefighters
[1:35:12.600 --> 1:35:17.400]  police you know amy goodman down there on the ground hearing the countdown you know then
[1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:24.360]  suddenly the building falls uh again we don't make a big a big enough deal about this i mean
[1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:28.840]  we know it's an inside job so we don't go out and point out that the evidence just piles up
[1:35:28.840 --> 1:35:35.560]  this is huge and i demand a grand jury in new york new york state somewhere else in the country
[1:35:35.560 --> 1:35:42.520]  because people were lost from all over the u.s all over the world call some of these people before
[1:35:42.520 --> 1:35:48.680]  them before the feds kill them like this fire lieutenant and say okay uh you know you know
[1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:55.080]  exactly who told you they were planning to bring the building down again ladies and gentlemen we
[1:35:55.080 --> 1:36:01.240]  know it's an inside job here's the evidence in front of you it just keeps stacking up stay with us
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:11.640]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[1:36:15.800 --> 1:36:24.280]  he is a new jersey police detective who responded on 9 11 so he's a 9 11 first responder
[1:36:24.280 --> 1:36:32.440]  detective john carol i know he's had richard gauge and to speak to police uh in the new jersey
[1:36:32.440 --> 1:36:37.240]  new york area has a lot of courage and now he's becoming more vocal and i already had him set up
[1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:43.400]  for the show yesterday but it dovetails perfectly into what i've been covering in the last 30 minutes
[1:36:43.960 --> 1:36:50.280]  here at prism planet dot tv and of course on the radio show that we're simulcasting uh with right now
[1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:56.040]  um and that is that i mean fireman police i've got a bunch of other audio and video clips i'm
[1:36:56.040 --> 1:37:00.760]  going to play this hour uh on record saying we heard the countdown but not just them saying that
[1:37:00.760 --> 1:37:06.440]  to us now we have cnn and msnbc and others were saying get back get back they're bringing it down
[1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:13.000]  and then the feds when they approach you at ground zero they go how dare you i mean these
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:18.520]  guys are wicked they'll say how dare you they'll just be like looking at you with dagger eyes
[1:37:18.520 --> 1:37:23.800]  how dare you say the cops and fireman blew it up we go we didn't say that they were just giving
[1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:27.720]  the official story they were bringing it down for everybody's safety and then told to shut up
[1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:36.120]  they're like oh and then they'll tell the crowd you hear him they say the fireman did it uh again
[1:37:36.120 --> 1:37:41.960]  and and and then they'll look to see how the how the ops working i mean these people are sick
[1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:50.760]  they are sick and uh this was a giant false flag attack and there's all the evidence thousands of
[1:37:50.760 --> 1:37:57.960]  pieces but building seven not just the evidence uh of of thermate and thermite and explosions and
[1:37:57.960 --> 1:38:05.080]  the building falling at freefall and nist now having to admit that it's that for some reason
[1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:17.400]  another plane didn't hit it something else developed something else you know guys when
[1:38:17.400 --> 1:38:22.280]  i go into these coughing fits just put a screen up because i'm in here sick and i just i just put
[1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:26.040]  a screen up whenever you see me going to cough so we don't torture people with that on television
[1:38:26.040 --> 1:38:35.640]  or i may not be able to continue the show here yes we can't all right anyways um again i'm in
[1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:39.480]  here even though i've been sick the last few days because this information is too important so just
[1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:50.440]  bear with me folks um what you can do is just name a camera at the wall and then cut to that
[1:38:50.440 --> 1:38:56.440]  all right um look you know
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:01.960]  i'm way past um
[1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:10.920]  i'm way past even and this isn't about radio this isn't about my films this isn't about anything
[1:39:11.560 --> 1:39:15.960]  with me i mean this other than the fact that i'm in danger from fighting these murder ambassadors
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:22.200]  and everybody else is that fights them but we're in greater danger of not standing up to them and
[1:39:24.920 --> 1:39:28.760]  this is real folks we're really fighting people that would attack their own country
[1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:32.040]  and then pose as saviors on top the smoking pile of rubble and dead
[1:39:34.280 --> 1:39:38.120]  and we really do have a corrupt elite that is just completely out of control
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:44.440]  and they really did stage the terror attacks i mean even if you don't want to believe it they
[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:49.800]  really do make big mistakes and it was known to the police environment that they at least
[1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:55.160]  blew up building seven and it would take weeks or months to do that and it was a spookhouse full
[1:39:55.160 --> 1:40:02.440]  of fbi defense intelligence cia you name it and they are killing 911 first responders that are
[1:40:02.440 --> 1:40:08.120]  blowing the whistle and they are going after we are changed and they do have fbi harassing them
[1:40:08.120 --> 1:40:13.480]  and i do get death threats over this and this is real ladies and gentlemen this is real and you
[1:40:13.480 --> 1:40:19.400]  just heard a fire department commander on record saying that they'd been told that the feds had a
[1:40:19.400 --> 1:40:24.840]  plan to bring down building seven to quote protect other buildings which they did it went down
[1:40:24.840 --> 1:40:33.800]  perfectly in its own footprint so enough said detective john carol i appreciate uh you coming
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:39.160]  on the show uh with us today first i know you were listening earlier give me your take on
[1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:45.960]  the latest you know mainstream live clip where police firemen and others were said we were told
[1:40:45.960 --> 1:40:50.920]  to get back they were going to bring down seven we were expecting this all day again not saying
[1:40:50.920 --> 1:40:55.400]  fire and police are involved but now after the fact when they cover up they become complicit to
[1:40:55.400 --> 1:41:01.400]  some degree you are not complicit because you're still the hero you were fighting that day to
[1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:06.280]  help the people and fighting the data expose the truth but god forbid our police and firemen do come
[1:41:06.280 --> 1:41:12.040]  complicit by playing along with this so uh detective carol thanks for coming on with us
[1:41:12.600 --> 1:41:21.480]  uh thanks for having me alice you bet absolutely um i i think it's up to old law enforcement military
[1:41:21.480 --> 1:41:29.720]  law enforcement we swore to protect this country this is what and we compensated for it you know
[1:41:29.720 --> 1:41:37.240]  the the majority uh detective uh on 9 11 i mean we knew positive uh i didn't know it was positive
[1:41:37.240 --> 1:41:42.120]  seven at the time nobody we just heard a building was definitely coming down we ran out we you know
[1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:48.680]  we were just you know evacuated but anybody that's not coming forward in law enforcement at this point
[1:41:49.640 --> 1:41:55.080]  it is complicit after the fact would you agree with that no i agree with you anybody who's seen
[1:41:55.080 --> 1:42:01.240]  the facts and who is in denial uh and i've had so many police come up and shake my hand or wave
[1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:06.280]  or thank me when i'm down at ground zero but then most of them don't want to go on camera some do
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:11.800]  now wave at us and give us thumbs up even commanders but they won't go on tape and then there's always
[1:42:11.800 --> 1:42:16.520]  blackout military stalking around in uniform giving us dirty looks probably involved in the attacks
[1:42:17.640 --> 1:42:22.200]  but again they did that for america you know they they staged the attack to make us grow up and get
[1:42:22.200 --> 1:42:28.520]  tougher on good you know that's the sick attitude it's so sick well alex i'm not i'm a trained
[1:42:28.520 --> 1:42:34.840]  professional and i i will protect myself and my family absolutely so i mean specifically going back
[1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:41.880]  to that day uh i mean so the average fireman the average emergency worker the average police officer
[1:42:41.880 --> 1:42:46.680]  you just heard oh seven's coming down you know big deal three buildings first time in history from
[1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:55.160]  fire it's coming down get back well uh again i'm not a structural engineer i'm i we weren't aware
[1:42:55.160 --> 1:43:04.120]  that the vernacular but we we were told i would i would say about an hour before i would say i think
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:12.200]  again i'm jersey city so our communications we're we're directly across the river it was
[1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:22.680]  practically an hour before that we told to uh to evacuate and specifically what did you hear
[1:43:23.720 --> 1:43:29.400]  um just to the building was we was coming down i went in uh see we were jersey personal
[1:43:30.040 --> 1:43:37.080]  so we were uh we were just told to to evacuate so on record they knew building seven was coming
[1:43:37.080 --> 1:43:42.440]  down and what does it like to hear all these or see all these video clips of police fireman
[1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:48.120]  emergency workers all saying that they were told you know higher ups that the feds were gonna bring
[1:43:48.120 --> 1:43:53.800]  down building seven and then in hindsight because that proves inside job to see it all being denied
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:44:00.520]  well this hardening but you have to put it in proper context i mean how do we move forward and
[1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:08.360]  i think your show provides the uh you know the apparatus to do to do to motivate us and uh i
[1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:11.880]  think that's what we're doing i think that's individuals like myself and a lot of cops are
[1:44:11.880 --> 1:44:17.880]  listening right now too just so you know well i want to just beg them to have the courage to
[1:44:17.880 --> 1:44:23.320]  stand up and speak out an investigation in new york or new jersey by people inside the system
[1:44:23.320 --> 1:44:28.280]  could literally bring down the new world order if if it comes out that it's an inside job main
[1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:33.720]  line they can't kill all of you uh then this will bring down the new world order they cannot survive
[1:44:33.720 --> 1:44:38.040]  this and i've risked my life and many others have been killed to bring you this information
[1:44:38.040 --> 1:44:43.480]  so i hope to god you'll have the courage to at least investigate what we're saying now now specifically
[1:44:47.320 --> 1:44:52.360]  in your own saga trying to wake up your department that's one of the reasons you're here today
[1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:58.360]  break that down i mean talk about whatever you want well whatever attempted to do and now i
[1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:03.880]  i haven't done this formally so i want to be i want to be uh specific with that and be and be clear
[1:45:03.880 --> 1:45:09.320]  with it i haven't put it on uh formally on paper which i mean that's how you establish a uh a paper
[1:45:09.320 --> 1:45:16.440]  trail as far as making a formal request and i i'm i'm walking a fine line here because they could
[1:45:16.440 --> 1:45:22.920]  bring charges against me so i have to be very careful what i say first of all uh we don't we're
[1:45:22.920 --> 1:45:30.360]  jersey city it's a hotbed of you know middle middle eastern people it's a it's a microcosm of
[1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:37.240]  all types of people in jerry city we really are a a bouliabaisse uh ethnic bouliabaisse here but
[1:45:37.240 --> 1:45:47.960]  we don't have a uh terrorist task force which is on to me and when i try when i when i try to
[1:45:48.840 --> 1:45:54.040]  to uh you know i attempt to speak to people about the issue there's some that uh my fellow officers
[1:45:54.040 --> 1:46:02.760]  require from me and i have no idea why they do that you know that and that's why i was one excuse me
[1:46:02.760 --> 1:46:09.720]  i want to ask you advice on how to present the information to them well i mean i don't have
[1:46:09.720 --> 1:46:16.200]  all the answers but first off i would understand that they're in fear deep down they know it's true
[1:46:16.760 --> 1:46:21.800]  they're not stupid and they want to hold on to their life it's too scary to admit there's this
[1:46:21.800 --> 1:46:26.440]  big evil power running the government uh that would do something like this and they psychologically
[1:46:26.440 --> 1:46:32.760]  associate themselves with that wicked force and and so there's a lot of reasons down below the
[1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:37.960]  surface and the subconscious uh why they're doing that but they need to understand that gulf of
[1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:44.680]  tonkin was staged us's liberty was staged the nato option operation ajax this is all admitted
[1:46:44.680 --> 1:46:52.280]  huge terror attacks staged you can give them northwoods abc news plans to kill us troops plans to
[1:46:52.280 --> 1:46:58.600]  bomb us cities and blame it on foreign enemies and so first that this has gone on and then i would
[1:46:58.600 --> 1:47:03.000]  just show them the clips of going okay why did they report that building seven was going to be brought
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:10.760]  down and then later say that it was just fire that did it when no steel building had ever done this
[1:47:10.760 --> 1:47:15.640]  and then here's richard gaige's information this needs to be looked into and then i would give
[1:47:15.640 --> 1:47:19.560]  him the keith oberman clip talking about dick chaney wanting to stage terror attacks against
[1:47:19.560 --> 1:47:25.240]  their own ships uh the cy harsh report on that and then say okay and then i would also give
[1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:33.320]  him the polls showing the majority of americans believe that there's a 9-11 cover-up i mean
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:38.920]  as a police officer you know you reconcile your mortality pretty much on a daily basis
[1:47:38.920 --> 1:47:43.880]  i don't think it i don't really don't think it's a fear for their safety i just believe it's a
[1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:50.200]  it's more of that would hang on an emotional fear no no i agree they've done studies stay there we'll
[1:47:50.200 --> 1:47:53.320]  come back and talk about this is important but i want to hear what you have to say not just you
[1:47:53.320 --> 1:47:59.080]  know myself it's easier to charge a machine gun nest to go against your peers they found that in
[1:47:59.080 --> 1:48:08.680]  psychological studies we'll be right back all right detective john carol from jersey city
[1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:14.440]  new jersey is our guest he was the first responder on the day of 9 11 and throughout the next few
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:21.320]  days working there on the pile and a lot of his uh cohorts listening right now there in his department
[1:48:22.040 --> 1:48:28.280]  look sir i mean you know more about being a police officer than i do and how to deal with it i would
[1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:33.560]  just tell these officers look at 8.5 trillion stolen in eight weeks and counting the people
[1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:38.760]  that did this attack aren't going to stop i mean and and now trips on the streets and all of them i
[1:48:38.760 --> 1:48:46.360]  mean we have been taken over by foreign corporate interests that are looting us and uh i mean i
[1:48:46.360 --> 1:48:50.120]  guess they can just live in denial and they're going to lose everything they got because criminals
[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:54.040]  that'll do something this big aren't going to stop but i mean go ahead make your points make your
[1:48:54.040 --> 1:49:00.760]  points of your awakening and where you see all this going well again i was i'm not a professional
[1:49:00.760 --> 1:49:06.520]  order i mean i i find myself a fairly articulate person but i'm not a professional orator either
[1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:14.040]  but go ahead well you sure come up you come off like one but uh i think at the end of the day
[1:49:15.560 --> 1:49:21.000]  to try to inspire people to move forward in general not just police officers they need to
[1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:29.560]  to assimilate to to what what the reality is and and i think it's just at such a core level that
[1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:36.120]  a 9-11 issue was just such a it redefines your existence and i think that's the wall that i'm
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  bouncing against now for some reason i could i could see through it but i i think that police are
[1:49:45.720 --> 1:49:53.480]  you know we we're authoritative would you you become that over i mean i i was never that type
[1:49:53.480 --> 1:49:59.640]  of guy that began with excuse me before i became a cop but you sort of become that and i think
[1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:07.640]  that insulates you even more so than a than a citizen um not a citizen you know you know me
[1:50:07.640 --> 1:50:12.600]  and i know i understand the general public the civilians yeah the civilians but the bottom line
[1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:18.840]  is historically police are one of the most abused groups by corrupt systems and so police need to
[1:50:18.840 --> 1:50:23.000]  know historically you're not immune in fact you're going to get the dirty end of the stick
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:29.320]  generally i mean i mean did the new order i mean do the new world order care about the cops and
[1:50:29.320 --> 1:50:34.200]  firemen and when they block the treatment for the dust when they told you the dust wasn't bad
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:41.960]  well i went for the test and i'm healthy as a horse no that's good but it did kill a lot of people
[1:50:41.960 --> 1:50:48.280]  yes it did that's confirmed i mean mount signa yeah absolutely and remember the government
[1:50:48.280 --> 1:50:52.840]  tried to deny that for four years but now they have all the CAT scans of thousands thousands
[1:50:52.840 --> 1:50:59.880]  are dead so uh good thing um good thing that didn't happen to you did you get a breathing mass
[1:50:59.880 --> 1:51:05.000]  pretty quick uh no i had i pretty much had a spackle mask on the whole time well you were smart
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:11.240]  to have that brother that's probably what saved you yeah um getting back to the i mean the the
[1:51:11.240 --> 1:51:19.240]  overlying point is that what happened here is so overwhelming that for the average human being
[1:51:19.240 --> 1:51:24.200]  throughout their their their minds around it that that's where it becomes the issue i think that
[1:51:24.200 --> 1:51:30.040]  that's the core issue and you speak to you speak to it so eloquently and trump but it's just difficult
[1:51:30.040 --> 1:51:35.240]  for me to turn people on well i mean here's an example i knew 15 years ago 13 years ago when i
[1:51:35.240 --> 1:51:42.120]  got on air that most pork you buy at the store raw pork has live worms in it that will eat your brain
[1:51:42.120 --> 1:51:46.840]  now i tell people that and they laugh at me now i play a fox news clip about how suddenly
[1:51:46.840 --> 1:51:51.000]  thousands of people are having their brains eaten by these worms people finally listen
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:55.320]  who would believe that there's worms eating people's brains and that nobody's trying to stop
[1:51:55.320 --> 1:52:00.600]  these pigs from mexico coming in you know i'm not making that up and i'm not making up that 9
[1:52:00.600 --> 1:52:06.680]  11's an inside job either so you know i don't know what to say to people there's people right now
[1:52:06.680 --> 1:52:12.760]  on my website saying we're making it up about the worms that eat people's brains so i mean i can't
[1:52:12.760 --> 1:52:17.000]  do anything other than just tell people that okay if you don't want to believe us that's fine
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:21.480]  but but but the evidence is over we're going to come back in a long segment and and i want to
[1:52:21.480 --> 1:52:28.040]  specifically get into uh you know where this goes in your department challenging people
[1:52:28.040 --> 1:52:34.680]  you know the types of responses you get but but uh keep making your points well again
[1:52:34.680 --> 1:52:42.840]  and what what i think we collectively what police should do especially on 9 11 survivors
[1:52:42.840 --> 1:52:48.040]  they should there needs to be a coalition and that's what i'm going to try to attempt to do
[1:52:48.600 --> 1:52:54.920]  because we i don't trust government at all i understand but i do trust people and there's
[1:52:54.920 --> 1:53:01.160]  a lot of good people in the government so what i want to do is move forward um and and try to
[1:53:01.160 --> 1:53:08.440]  establish just a a group of people that can wrap the first of all wrap their minds around us
[1:53:09.160 --> 1:53:15.640]  and then move forward from there yeah i would call it police and military for 9 11 truth i think
[1:53:15.640 --> 1:53:21.880]  they already have similar groups now you know uh what was it the daughter of the supposed flight
[1:53:21.880 --> 1:53:28.760]  77 in new jersey they admitted was murdered by arson by a can of gas in the face in her hallway
[1:53:28.760 --> 1:53:34.360]  so i'm just telling you be careful officer carol i know you're not stupid but i'm telling you they
[1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:40.440]  will kill you uh if they think they can shut you down the fact that you're speaking out now is great
[1:53:40.440 --> 1:53:45.720]  but i would get as many officers as you can now to just call for an investigation to say hey
[1:53:45.720 --> 1:53:50.120]  we think there should be an investigation of the dust the collapse all of it and then they
[1:53:50.120 --> 1:53:56.600]  can't kill you all but now is the phase where you're in danger he's the t rex of political talk
[1:53:56.600 --> 1:54:00.120]  alex jones on the gcn radio network
[1:54:04.440 --> 1:54:08.440]  all right we're back live luprodowski waiting in the wings uh
[1:54:08.440 --> 1:54:15.400]  detective john carol from jersey city new jersey joins us 9 11 first responder survivor hero
[1:54:16.440 --> 1:54:23.080]  and uh we have so many tapes of police fireman emergency responders i want to play one
[1:54:23.080 --> 1:54:30.680]  uh right now uh from an emt who was on the site just a brief clip then we're going to go back
[1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:35.560]  to the police officer and others uh but uh here is that clip
[1:54:37.960 --> 1:54:42.600]  it's the next video clip uh on the dvd yes from from truth rising here it is
[1:54:44.040 --> 1:54:48.600]  as kevin mcpadden i was the first responder on 9 11 and i'm a prior air force medic
[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:54.600]  he was there he was there when building semen came down and he clearly hears a countdown of the
[1:54:54.600 --> 1:55:01.720]  building being demolitioned on the first day on 9 11 uh we're staged north of building seven
[1:55:02.280 --> 1:55:07.320]  amy goodman was out in the any intersection part a world trace center building seven your opinion
[1:55:08.440 --> 1:55:15.480]  i think it needs to be further investigated they had half of us separate into search and rescue
[1:55:15.480 --> 1:55:22.440]  and half of us into medical assistance when we saw the the fireman pick up and start grabbing
[1:55:22.440 --> 1:55:26.520]  their equipment and bustling back and forth you know they were getting ready to do something
[1:55:26.520 --> 1:55:32.040]  we started asking questions and so we had our eyes on this red cross representative that was
[1:55:32.040 --> 1:55:38.120]  holding a radio so you know usually the person who's holding the radio has answers well what's
[1:55:38.120 --> 1:55:42.680]  going on what's going on well what are the firemen running around for like there's something going on
[1:55:42.680 --> 1:55:47.720]  and next you know there's firemen grabbing all their equipment and there was a whole
[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:53.240]  bustle and shuffle of firemen going on he goes over he talks to the fireman he comes back with
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:58.120]  his hand covered over the radio and he's like you know just sit tight just sit tight calm down
[1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:05.480]  it's calm down you know it's all right he finally has his face that is like he was heartbroken
[1:56:05.480 --> 1:56:18.120]  he's like just run for your life rescue workers pushed people away from the scene
[1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:31.560]  we are walking back to the building about to blow up it takes his hand off and you hear three two one and it was boom boom boom boom boom boom
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:41.720]  I said you know we've had such terrible loss of life maybe the smartest thing to do is
[1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:51.880]  is pull it and they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:59.080]  educated an amazing individual he studied architecture again that's from truth rising
[1:56:59.080 --> 1:57:03.560]  that's where everybody needs to get the dvd make copies of it get it out to everybody this is
[1:57:04.280 --> 1:57:08.200]  probably the most important 9-11 film out there just because it gets into every
[1:57:08.200 --> 1:57:14.600]  aspect of it including the movement but you know it's not just that witness or all the other firemen
[1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:19.800]  or police or emergency workers it's that we even then have the video of Amy Goodman in the shot he's
[1:57:19.800 --> 1:57:24.600]  talking about with he and others milling around in the shot you can even see him there in the blurred
[1:57:24.600 --> 1:57:31.560]  video and then we talked to Amy Goodman and she admits she remembers it and we have the footage
[1:57:31.560 --> 1:57:36.040]  of the cops saying get back it's coming down they're going to bring it down I mean we don't
[1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:46.440]  just have eyewitnesses we have live CNN and MSNBC news feeds of it happening now again officer
[1:57:47.240 --> 1:57:52.200]  detective John Carroll I mean when what do you call that in a case when the evidence piles up and
[1:57:52.200 --> 1:57:59.640]  piles up and piles up and piles up and piles up and piles up and piles up and piles up and piles up
[1:57:59.640 --> 1:58:04.440]  and then it's all in our face and then they tell us don't even discuss it don't even look at it what
[1:58:04.440 --> 1:58:12.680]  do you call that well I'm just a preponderance of evidence I mean so what do you mean by that
[1:58:12.680 --> 1:58:17.080]  well I mean I mean I mean it's a two-parter I mean yeah I mean just an overwhelming open and
[1:58:17.080 --> 1:58:22.360]  shut case in your face hidden in plain view but yeah and then and then they just cover that up I
[1:58:22.360 --> 1:58:26.680]  mean it's like an elephant sitting on you in the living room and people are saying there's
[1:58:26.680 --> 1:58:31.880]  not an elephant in here well oftentimes in law enforcement see again Alex I have to be very careful
[1:58:31.880 --> 1:58:37.560]  of how I address questions because I'm hold to hold still hold to protocol so I have to be you know
[1:58:37.560 --> 1:58:45.320]  even even commenting about you know police work is you know that would give them uh how would you
[1:58:45.320 --> 1:58:49.880]  get in trouble I mean you don't lose your first amendment do you're not even allowed to comment
[1:58:49.880 --> 1:58:55.800]  on on on the 9-11 investigation or what are you saying well well no it's just when it when it comes
[1:58:55.800 --> 1:59:02.520]  to just police work in general that's where that what I'm saying about 9-11 that that's going to
[1:59:02.520 --> 1:59:08.760]  bring from my standpoint things to a forefront you know but when it comes to actual direct police
[1:59:08.760 --> 1:59:14.200]  work I can't really comment that's where that's that that's where they can get me in trouble
[1:59:14.200 --> 1:59:19.320]  that that's where they can do me oh or you start stating things as a detective yes specifically
[1:59:19.320 --> 1:59:25.400]  in your capacity well the minute the minute I retire I'll come on your show for you know anytime
[1:59:25.400 --> 1:59:30.600]  of you graciously have me and I'll I'll speak at noise no sure yesterday when I got the message
[1:59:30.600 --> 1:59:34.920]  relayed from Aaron I must have misunderstood it was that you're basically throwing down the gauntlet
[1:59:34.920 --> 1:59:41.720]  to the department can you clarify that well what I want to do and it was sort of short notice and
[1:59:41.720 --> 1:59:47.240]  everyone's on vacation right now what I want to do is basically say I'm not going to work now I'm a
[1:59:47.240 --> 1:59:53.160]  15 year veteran I got all the bells and whistles I don't want to go into my my resume but I get the
[1:59:53.160 --> 2:00:03.720]  I'm I'm clean as a clean as my mother's war so I'm beyond reproach but we have to force this thing
[2:00:03.720 --> 2:00:09.720]  now this thing has come to a head and now it now it's time that good men stand up and do what good
[2:00:09.720 --> 2:00:14.680]  men do and this is what I'm doing well we were talking before the show and you were you know
[2:00:14.680 --> 2:00:19.720]  talking about the fact that you did swear enough and that oath is to the people like you said it's
[2:00:19.720 --> 2:00:25.720]  not to some shadowy intelligence agency that controls the government absolutely and I and
[2:00:25.720 --> 2:00:31.560]  I want to speak to old military police listening right now and I'm sure there are a lot we swore
[2:00:31.560 --> 2:00:37.080]  in oath people this is what you're supposed to be doing I don't trust government never did but
[2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:41.240]  trust people in government there's enough of us out there that we're not going to let this happen
[2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:47.320]  we're simply not going to let it happen now if I'm fighting with death or whatever I'm a trained
[2:00:47.320 --> 2:00:53.640]  professional I don't have to tap myself and it and if anybody's playing on doing anything you know
[2:00:53.640 --> 2:01:01.320]  why you better send a lot of them I but but you police reconcile their mortality I know what I'm
[2:01:01.320 --> 2:01:08.440]  doing here I will take you out well in a way that's I mean that's liberating isn't it to go ahead
[2:01:08.440 --> 2:01:14.120]  and reconcile it deal with it go through it go past it kind of go past the point I return I mean
[2:01:14.120 --> 2:01:19.320]  because I've been not put in the position of a police officer the danger you're in every day but
[2:01:19.320 --> 2:01:24.360]  I've been physically attacked I've been death-threaded you know no doubt I face a lot of different
[2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:29.480]  type of dangers my name being besmirched being physically attacked being audited things like
[2:01:29.480 --> 2:01:34.200]  that but it really is liberating in a way to just say I am who I am and I'm not backing down and
[2:01:34.200 --> 2:01:40.200]  that's just the end of it yes it is it's very liberating but as you know as police officers
[2:01:40.200 --> 2:01:45.080]  I think as people in general I think that's just the human quality once you get past that point of
[2:01:45.080 --> 2:01:53.800]  fear that you speak to that's when you you do make that quantum leap and I've sort of I've stayed
[2:01:53.800 --> 2:02:00.600]  quiet too long it was because of my job that I did you know I took my oh seriously I take my
[2:02:00.600 --> 2:02:07.640]  profession seriously you know it provides food for my family but I'm compensated for the the
[2:02:07.640 --> 2:02:14.600]  privilege of helping people imagine imagine that imagine being paid to be a hero that's right
[2:02:14.600 --> 2:02:20.280]  well it's a sacred office as long as it's controlled by the people and a good thing it's too bad this
[2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:25.160]  system is corrupt systems been corrupting that destroying something that you know really was
[2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:31.960]  honorable and still can be salvaged what woke you up detective carol first to the fact that
[2:02:31.960 --> 2:02:38.840]  things were shady surrounding 9-11 well actually on 9-11 itself I mean I'm again I'm not a structural
[2:02:38.840 --> 2:02:44.680]  engineer and that's where Richard Gage comes in and he can speak to it much more articulately
[2:02:44.680 --> 2:02:51.080]  than I can from the structural input but there was a makeshift I can speak to this there was a
[2:02:51.080 --> 2:02:57.320]  makeshift morgue on excuse me on Liberty Island that's where the you know Statue of Liberty right
[2:02:57.320 --> 2:03:08.440]  there and we expect in 20,000 bodies it was it was very hectic that day it's I sort of I sort of
[2:03:08.440 --> 2:03:16.760]  trying to try to forget it try to you know subliminally push it down but my my ex-o at the time
[2:03:17.400 --> 2:03:25.080]  now I wasn't there I wasn't present when he heard it but he he was in civilians he was in
[2:03:25.080 --> 2:03:29.320]  civvies he was in civilian clothing so he was taken in and mistakenly taken in as military
[2:03:29.880 --> 2:03:37.320]  now I didn't hear this I wasn't there but he was taken uh into a briefing and they had a
[2:03:37.320 --> 2:03:45.400]  satellite overlay of ground zero with a bunch of uh you know red dots and it was uh UEDs
[2:03:46.440 --> 2:03:53.400]  unexplored devices now that that that's not hearsay he told me that and I won't say his name
[2:03:53.400 --> 2:04:00.760]  on it but they you know the it was army corps engineers it was uh old branches of military
[2:04:00.760 --> 2:04:07.240]  and then they were they were actually passes now that I saw they actually had passes printed passes
[2:04:07.240 --> 2:04:14.840]  to get in yeah they were already ready within hours to control the crime scene because they needed
[2:04:14.840 --> 2:04:20.120]  to control it they needed to make sure that that evidence was covered up um I want to go
[2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:24.280]  to Luke Radowski here in a few minutes but I want to keep you on specifically when you first
[2:04:24.280 --> 2:04:31.960]  called in yesterday uh you were uh and around a time you were talking about you know other issues
[2:04:31.960 --> 2:04:40.040]  other instances you mentioned 93 you mentioned other things that had happened well there's old
[2:04:40.040 --> 2:04:45.880]  there's always the blind sheet the the blind sheet see again I'm trading on on grounds here
[2:04:45.880 --> 2:04:51.560]  but the blind sheet check ob del rockman out of the new jersey pizza place yeah but uh yeah right
[2:04:51.560 --> 2:04:56.200]  above was above the police place that that's in uh journal square there is all kinds of intel
[2:04:56.200 --> 2:05:01.080]  that we we we still we don't have access to and that we're with the jersey police department how
[2:05:01.080 --> 2:05:07.960]  how would we don't have a terrorist passport you know this is we should be you know if it is a
[2:05:07.960 --> 2:05:12.840]  soul a so-called hotbed of terror terrorist activity how are we not involved well here's
[2:05:12.840 --> 2:05:17.880]  the man I mean you know but I mean you know about a mod salon the FBI hires him they have him cook
[2:05:17.880 --> 2:05:22.280]  the bomb train the driver and this is real muslim terrorists but they literally create the group
[2:05:22.280 --> 2:05:26.760]  pointed at the trade center tell them to park it up against the pillar thank god they didn't
[2:05:26.760 --> 2:05:31.160]  that's on record because mod salon figured out they were setting him up because he didn't want
[2:05:31.160 --> 2:05:34.600]  to he wasn't really a muslim extremist he would have been hired to do this by the FBI
[2:05:34.600 --> 2:05:40.280]  he recorded them so they had to pay him a million three but I mean look it's been in the new york
[2:05:40.280 --> 2:05:45.000]  papers the new jersey papers the pennsylvania papers that the firefighters and police found
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:50.280]  three of the four boxes that's actually come out congressional testimony and the FBI seized them
[2:05:50.280 --> 2:05:56.520]  why grab the flight recorders what are they covering up but we we know the way it works out
[2:05:56.520 --> 2:06:02.200]  it really is like like tv I mean it really is like the movies the way they portray the
[2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:07.720]  relationship between local police and FBI you know when the the fed comes on the scene and
[2:06:07.720 --> 2:06:12.040]  you know the local cop just you know flips you know flips them off and that's pretty much the way
[2:06:12.040 --> 2:06:18.120]  it is you know we're just glorified security guards so so we don't so we don't have access to this
[2:06:18.120 --> 2:06:22.760]  well the way it's supposed to work unless it was a federal marshal with a directive from the president
[2:06:22.760 --> 2:06:29.000]  or the congress they're not supposed to be involved you see everything is asked backwards excuse that
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:33.960]  term but that's what it is it's all backwards the states are supposed to be sovereign and they're
[2:06:33.960 --> 2:06:40.200]  supposed to kiss your boots not the other way around but yeah but you know to take that posture
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:44.360]  what you want to do is I mean I think we just need more more access
[2:06:45.320 --> 2:06:49.320]  now the from now I'm talking from no I know but that's not going to happen as long as we have
[2:06:49.320 --> 2:06:55.080]  feds running things look the feds covered up for made-off while he stole not a 50 but 100 billion
[2:06:55.080 --> 2:07:02.200]  bucks okay and now they're covering for him again so I mean it just the feds are foreign it's a foreign
[2:07:02.200 --> 2:07:08.120]  bank has hijacked America it's a corporate takeover any other key points concerning 9-11
[2:07:08.120 --> 2:07:15.320]  or or anything else about your ex-o your commander going in there and into that military briefing
[2:07:15.320 --> 2:07:21.640]  out there at the makeshift morgue out there at the Statue of Liberty and anything else he saw on
[2:07:21.640 --> 2:07:26.920]  those overlays any other little tidbits they're important for people out there now it was basically
[2:07:26.920 --> 2:07:34.280]  you know an overlay map satellite overlay and again I didn't see this this is corner my ex-o
[2:07:34.280 --> 2:07:40.840]  and that uh the army corps had you know had sealed it off now that was later on that night that
[2:07:40.840 --> 2:07:48.760]  was actually after plaza 7 fell so we got I got evacuated from battery park so we went directly
[2:07:48.760 --> 2:07:58.120]  from battery park to Liberty island now now I just sort of like we just slowly brushed you know
[2:07:58.120 --> 2:08:02.920]  we rush each other as he went in and then when he came out he had just like we saw the look on
[2:08:02.920 --> 2:08:09.400]  his face and I asked him I said you know what what's going on you know and I was I was actually
[2:08:09.400 --> 2:08:15.960]  my base number was 9-11 on 9-11 and and he and he looked at the he looked at my base on because
[2:08:15.960 --> 2:08:19.320]  you know your base number's money I remember he was the first individual say that to me
[2:08:19.320 --> 2:08:24.520]  that's amazing well I I mean I know you had Richard Gage in the town to speak to uh folks
[2:08:24.520 --> 2:08:32.200]  did that have an effect on your colleagues no you know again I think it's just it's uh
[2:08:32.200 --> 2:08:37.400]  a befuddlement I think people just can't wrap their minds around it and tell you the truth
[2:08:37.400 --> 2:08:43.480]  you know what they're they're most likely going to do number 15 year vet you know they're going
[2:08:43.480 --> 2:08:47.320]  to wind up you know sending me for a psych I'm saying that I'm you know I'm saying is the next
[2:08:47.320 --> 2:08:52.360]  guy but you know I know what I'm up against you I know what's going to happen yeah and I guess if
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:57.160]  you show all the CNN clips of them saying they blew the building up I guess that's the all them
[2:08:57.160 --> 2:09:03.960]  need psych evaluations as well yeah we're open to testosterone driven you know knuckleheads that
[2:09:03.960 --> 2:09:09.320]  well well as as as more of you stand up and speak out we and we commend your courage not
[2:09:09.320 --> 2:09:13.800]  going to be able to get away with this the establishment wouldn't be attacking us all these TV shows

[2:10:27.560 --> 2:10:33.240]  had Jesse Ventura family members rescue workers down at ground zero and you know that's why they
[2:10:33.240 --> 2:10:37.720]  came down there because we're having a huge effect at ground you know I haven't been keeping
[2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:43.080]  touch with Jesse or you guys I've been so busy on other things but I didn't know Ventura was up in
[2:10:43.080 --> 2:10:48.520]  New York uh I wish you guys would let me know about that ought to come in Jesse Ventura was
[2:10:48.520 --> 2:10:52.520]  there following a little bit he was shooting a pilot for his uh series that he's working on
[2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:57.080]  yeah I knew he was going back to New York for that yeah and he stopped by ground zero we had a lot
[2:10:57.080 --> 2:11:02.120]  of family members a lot of rescue workers it was an amazing day uh two weeks ago at ground zero
[2:11:02.120 --> 2:11:07.640]  it was real how long was he at ground zero what happened how long was he at ground zero he's only
[2:11:07.640 --> 2:11:13.320]  there for you know about uh around an hour or so not not that long at all I need to give him a call
[2:11:13.320 --> 2:11:17.480]  he emailed me the other day I need to give him a call because I'm uh working with him on that
[2:11:17.480 --> 2:11:23.240]  we'll see where that tv program goes look what do you think of um Detective John Carroll and what he
[2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:27.560]  has to say I mean it's a beautiful thing we definitely need more police officers and more
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:32.280]  people in the military on our side we get a lot of support again in the community at ground zero
[2:11:32.280 --> 2:11:37.560]  from a lot of people and it's sad seeing these people being questioned and harassed by the FBI
[2:11:37.560 --> 2:11:42.440]  about our organization but again we have nothing to hide we're a peaceful organization we want to
[2:11:42.440 --> 2:11:48.360]  work with the police with the military uh against the elite against the new world order that enslave
[2:11:48.360 --> 2:11:52.120]  us now stay there stay there fighting for the interests of the united states against the
[2:11:52.120 --> 2:12:01.720]  new world order we're the true patriots
[2:12:05.720 --> 2:12:14.120]  don't call my name out your window I'm leaving I won't even turn my head
[2:12:14.120 --> 2:12:26.360]  don't send your kin folks to give me no talking I'll be gone like I said yeah it was lonely
[2:12:28.040 --> 2:12:31.960]  years before 9-11 making films about government sponsored terrorism
[2:12:33.240 --> 2:12:38.040]  like america destroyed by design in 97 police state 2000
[2:12:38.040 --> 2:12:45.400]  that old familiar crying and other documentaries and then months before 9-11 saying call the
[2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:52.280]  white house tell them don't blow up the world trade center first and only time I've said call
[2:12:52.280 --> 2:12:57.080]  the white house and tell them don't blow up the buildings because I could see all the preparation
[2:12:57.080 --> 2:13:01.880]  on the news the preparation of the public mind and that's on record
[2:13:01.880 --> 2:13:09.800]  you know that aired many times on access tv that I aired July 25th live and that turned the tape
[2:13:09.800 --> 2:13:14.120]  in that day and it aired a few times it aired on the morning of 9-11 again and we got a bunch of
[2:13:14.120 --> 2:13:18.840]  death threats people thought I was on there on the day saying it was an inside job when it was
[2:13:18.840 --> 2:13:23.880]  two months old but jimmy vaughn my good friend who I didn't even know at the time he saw me live
[2:13:24.520 --> 2:13:29.720]  say call the white house he was on the fence about me and then two months later he saw the
[2:13:29.720 --> 2:13:36.360]  attack on the world trade centers and he said oh my god this stuff is really accurate so uh
[2:13:37.160 --> 2:13:42.120]  you know I'm on record saying that and that's that's what studying these people can do for you
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:47.480]  you can really understand where they're going to strike next their basic psychology their
[2:13:47.480 --> 2:13:54.680]  criminology uh I want to hold Luke and Detective John Carroll over five minutes the next segment
[2:13:54.680 --> 2:14:00.680]  then we have uh the author of target patent it's now come out that what we already knew was true
[2:14:01.240 --> 2:14:08.360]  the cia with the nkvd what was os s at the time with the nkvd killed george s patent because he
[2:14:08.360 --> 2:14:15.240]  wanted he didn't want to let the russians keep 12 000 us soldiers that had been captured by the
[2:14:15.240 --> 2:14:19.000]  nazis the russians took over those camps and said we want them for slave labor and for intel
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:26.760]  and patent said hell no I'm going public and they said die US government die sucker troops
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:32.760]  don't mean jack squat to us that's now mainstream news so for the cops out there that can't believe
[2:14:32.760 --> 2:14:37.320]  this can't get it through their heads or the public can't get it through their heads they killed
[2:14:37.320 --> 2:14:46.040]  patent over this stuff they think of you as dog meat um any comments on the dust on patent
[2:14:46.040 --> 2:14:54.680]  and just just on any of this historically um detective carol and then luke um well I bet
[2:14:54.680 --> 2:15:01.080]  you I believe they're capable of doing pretty much anything so uh I don't know enough about the uh
[2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:09.800]  the topic I would have to research it but I take out your word um a quick uh moment of private
[2:15:09.800 --> 2:15:16.200]  uh a little lighthearted thing I really appreciate you when you were talking to richard gaige
[2:15:16.200 --> 2:15:21.560]  when you were interviewing I should say Richard gaige and he was speaking about the uh the imposing
[2:15:21.560 --> 2:15:28.040]  hit piece that's that that's going to be coming oh yeah yeah and you get I just I like the way
[2:15:28.040 --> 2:15:34.760]  you presented it it was almost like buckle up pal wake up the reality yeah rich is a good man but
[2:15:34.760 --> 2:15:40.680]  he's you know he's you know I mean he's a good man great man very articulate I mean accomplished
[2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:47.000]  but there is you know there is a uh a very nuanced naïveté and just the way you just
[2:15:48.200 --> 2:15:54.360]  so you know how this business works pal buckle up yeah no no he's like beaver and the other guy's
[2:15:54.360 --> 2:16:00.760]  like eddy haskel and and I don't say that just as my opinion they have a hit piece specialist
[2:16:00.760 --> 2:16:07.800]  who makes films only attacking the alternative media jfk researchers so he is a specialist
[2:16:08.520 --> 2:16:12.200]  luke radowski your comments on the media and all these hit pieces coming out against us
[2:16:13.720 --> 2:16:16.920]  well again they don't care they don't care about the family members they don't care about the rest
[2:16:16.920 --> 2:16:20.520]  of the workers they don't care about the police officers it's about us getting the the information

[2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:45.240]  right now right now we're making a new film right now we're working very hard we're out there every
[2:18:45.240 --> 2:18:49.320]  saturday we're out there having meetings every friday we're doing excellent work there's a lot
[2:18:49.320 --> 2:18:54.520]  of amazing good people behind us a lot of great police officers uh i want to salute the detective
[2:18:54.520 --> 2:18:59.080]  thank him so much from the bottom of my heart there's a lot of good cops out there but uh we're
[2:18:59.080 --> 2:19:03.560]  also going through a lot of harassment by a lot of bad cops out there uh recently we went out to
[2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:09.160]  confront henry polson where i was confronted by police officers trying to arrest me for no reason
[2:19:09.160 --> 2:19:15.800]  i have the video of the police officer basically uh stopping me uh harassing me screaming at me
[2:19:15.800 --> 2:19:20.840]  for no reason at all for standing on the street corner where henry polson was supposed to be
[2:19:20.840 --> 2:19:26.920]  walking by well he's our god and he's stolen 8.5 trillion we have to love the foreign banker
[2:19:27.960 --> 2:19:32.680]  exactly and the secret service even admitted when we ran up to polson and we asked him how
[2:19:32.680 --> 2:19:37.000]  come you threatened martial law how come you threatened uh congress and the senate with
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:41.480]  martial law he grabbed the camera and when polson got in his car he was like yeah we were watching
[2:19:41.480 --> 2:19:45.800]  you all day and then we we heard everything that they were talking about with other people inside
[2:19:45.800 --> 2:19:50.920]  the event that they overheard the secret service guys talking about us look have you look have i
[2:19:50.920 --> 2:19:56.600]  gotten this polson footage up on the web yet uh not yet we're working on it we're working on the
[2:19:56.600 --> 2:20:03.480]  film right now well you know you know i did did you get all the videos i just mailed you i did not
[2:20:03.480 --> 2:20:08.040]  get anything yet okay well i know i've seen rob running around here dubbing videos for you guys to
[2:20:08.040 --> 2:20:13.880]  use for weeks so i don't know what's going on we just moved it's quite a mess uh but that's but
[2:20:13.880 --> 2:20:18.280]  yet again there's a lot of good police officers that need to get in need to educate all the other
[2:20:18.280 --> 2:20:23.720]  police officers because the level of harassment is really escalating with fbi officials talking to
[2:20:23.720 --> 2:20:28.440]  our supporters down at ground zero that are not even a part of our group that are just there working
[2:20:28.440 --> 2:20:33.240]  supporting us so we need to educate as many people as we can well that's because the system is
[2:20:33.240 --> 2:20:41.160]  threatened and folks can find out more at we are change dot or g and uh you got a lot of new chapters

[2:21:24.920 --> 2:21:29.480]  publicly a lot of other great people they're standing up and fighting for truth including
[2:21:29.480 --> 2:21:35.640]  former presidents of other countries former defense ministers uh you name it the genesis
[2:21:35.640 --> 2:21:42.360]  communications radio network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your
[2:21:42.360 --> 2:21:57.000]  mind okay ladies and gentlemen uh this weekend that was blown away to see this headline it then
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:06.120]  made headlines all across the world london telegraph general george s patent was assassinated
[2:22:06.120 --> 2:22:15.560]  to silence his criticism of allied leaders claims new book and in this article it goes
[2:22:15.560 --> 2:22:19.960]  through the evidence that i read little blurbs and other books other espionage books other
[2:22:19.960 --> 2:22:25.960]  world war two guests that we interview letters from patent home to family and others has promised
[2:22:25.960 --> 2:22:32.920]  to have parades and go to congress uh and demand that thousands of u.s soldiers captured by nazis
[2:22:32.920 --> 2:22:36.840]  that were then when the when the russians on the eastern front came into germany and poland
[2:22:36.840 --> 2:22:41.720]  they captured these u.s servicemen army airmen army marines and we're going to use them as
[2:22:41.720 --> 2:22:47.800]  slave labor the numbers as high as 12 000 he got very upset about that very patriotic extremely
[2:22:47.800 --> 2:22:53.800]  patriotic but actually did you know have allegiance to his troops he expected a lot of them but uh
[2:22:54.520 --> 2:22:58.120]  and i don't claim to be on some expert historian on patent but most people don't even read about
[2:22:58.120 --> 2:23:02.520]  world war two i've read a few books about patent probably read about more than 60 books total about
[2:23:02.520 --> 2:23:10.440]  world war two because it's such a pivotal sea change in world society but uh when i read this
[2:23:10.440 --> 2:23:14.920]  this is what experts you know that we've had on over the years said about how they
[2:23:15.640 --> 2:23:21.320]  favorites os s slash c i a way to kill somebody they rammed his car with a truck jumped up shot
[2:23:21.320 --> 2:23:26.920]  him with a low velocity bullet the throat didn't kill him so then they sit in in k v d to kill him
[2:23:26.920 --> 2:23:34.200]  and we knew he was saying the russians were a threat that you know that same thing macArthur
[2:23:34.200 --> 2:23:40.920]  got relieved from when the chinese port across the yalu river uh there in uh
[2:23:42.600 --> 2:23:47.720]  there in korea he wanted to use nukes and then they went to the un and stopped the whole deal
[2:23:48.520 --> 2:23:54.280]  because of course macArthur wasn't at that grid level which now totally declassified
[2:23:54.280 --> 2:24:01.560]  uh that actually the united states put the soviets uh you know in with money in 1917
[2:24:02.600 --> 2:24:06.840]  along with the bank of england and of course in 1949 now completely declassified even on the
[2:24:06.840 --> 2:24:12.280]  history channel the cia actually went with malice tongue against shankai shek and the
[2:24:12.280 --> 2:24:19.480]  nationalist so that was part of a larger strategic plan uh to create a false bipolar world and so
[2:24:19.480 --> 2:24:25.000]  the but but you know i'm getting off the issue here and i appreciate our guest joining us but
[2:24:25.720 --> 2:24:32.200]  this is an example of general george s patin who was upset about a lot of things being murdered
[2:24:32.200 --> 2:24:36.120]  and the line of telegraphs gone over the evidence and says they believe it's conclusive uh the
[2:24:36.120 --> 2:24:42.680]  author talked to the famous os s spy an assassin before he died he also has his diary and a lot
[2:24:42.680 --> 2:24:48.120]  of other eyewitness reports and material and it fits in with it's kind of like gulf of tonkin
[2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:52.440]  you know we always knew that was staged but now it's declassified cia admits it well same thing
[2:24:52.440 --> 2:24:57.880]  here so we have the expert on with us for the next uh 15 minutes and i appreciate robert k
[2:24:57.880 --> 2:25:03.320]  wilcox author of target patent and this is a book i will be getting and i will be reading
[2:25:03.320 --> 2:25:07.000]  in fact we have an online bookstore at info wars dot com maybe i should call a publisher and
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:10.520]  buy a few hundred and sell them on the site because this is something people need to know
[2:25:11.080 --> 2:25:16.680]  but uh again thank you so much for coming on the show with us mr wilcox glad to be with you alec
[2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:22.360]  tell us about yourself how you got into this as a historian and uh then break down what really
[2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:28.120]  happened to patent well i'm a a writer and i'm always looking for good stories and um i i
[2:25:29.160 --> 2:25:34.920]  my cousin is a uh he owns a detective agency and he we were working out one day and he just
[2:25:34.920 --> 2:25:40.840]  blurts out he uh that that that he knew that patent had been killed because he talked to the guy
[2:25:41.400 --> 2:25:45.880]  who uh had a lot of information about it now i was like most people i thought that
[2:25:45.880 --> 2:25:53.640]  uh patent had been uh had died from a normal accident a car accident and that's what i told him
[2:25:53.640 --> 2:25:58.600]  he said oh no no he said i can put you in touch with the guy he'll tell you about it well he didn't
[2:25:58.600 --> 2:26:03.640]  say tell me about it but anyway he can put me in touch with the guy and i i then as you mentioned
[2:26:03.640 --> 2:26:10.440]  earlier went and talked to douglas basata who was in fact an os s assassin now i want to preface
[2:26:10.440 --> 2:26:18.200]  this by saying that basata had lived a long life as a clandestine uh he had stayed on after uh world
[2:26:18.200 --> 2:26:23.000]  war two he had been one of the first jet birds this was the beginning of our special forces
[2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:30.520]  uh and had jumped in uh to to behind the nazi lines uh in conjunction with d-day and it organized
[2:26:30.520 --> 2:26:35.400]  the maki sterling guy and one of the things i did was go right into the national archives and found
[2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:41.320]  his records luckily they had been uh finally declassified and this guy had had won as many
[2:26:41.320 --> 2:26:47.400]  medals as anybody he was just a terrific terrific guy but um he had spent a long time as a clandestine
[2:26:47.400 --> 2:26:53.400]  and would have never talked to me in a million years i'm sure uh but he had had a stroke uh
[2:26:53.400 --> 2:26:59.160]  and he also had been promised that he would be given a big job in the cia and when he came back
[2:26:59.160 --> 2:27:02.920]  of course they didn't know who he was they're never any any records of anything like here
[2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:09.400]  he had to fight to get all of his uh uh uh v a benefits for uh for being stabbed shot
[2:27:09.960 --> 2:27:15.800]  all these other things and he became very very uh uh mad about it all and so that's why he
[2:27:15.800 --> 2:27:20.440]  howard huntwood public he knows they killed his wife blew her up and you know he did a deathbed
[2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:25.800]  confession about running the opt to kill kennedy but side issue please continue yeah well so that
[2:27:25.800 --> 2:27:30.600]  that's that's very true so all these things uh converse then i got him when he was sort of his
[2:27:30.600 --> 2:27:36.760]  his guard was down and uh and he just uh began to tell me about it and while i did not uh think
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:42.600]  that he had been involved i thought he just knew he then told me that he had uh been given an order
[2:27:42.600 --> 2:27:48.920]  by the head of the os s while bill donovan to kill patent and this by the way was the result of a
[2:27:48.920 --> 2:27:56.360]  long plot which was we could call stop patent and uh this is uh bonafide and when you read in target
[2:27:56.360 --> 2:28:03.000]  patent my book you'll see that way way back in 44 and 43 they began to not like patent he had
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:08.600]  tremendous jealousy because he was so good and then he was anti-communist he wasn't a globalist
[2:28:08.600 --> 2:28:13.880]  he was america uh i mean he had this long pedigree back to you know closely related to george
[2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:18.520]  washington and and and and then all the famous confederate uh you know some of the famous confederate
[2:28:18.520 --> 2:28:24.360]  generals so he had this incredible pedigree that that they didn't happen we know that uh izenhower
[2:28:24.360 --> 2:28:29.880]  was very very jealous of him because he was just a uh desk clerk and he wasn't playing ball
[2:28:29.880 --> 2:28:35.560]  with uncle joe stollen but the key here is this assassin and and that's what the telegraph researched
[2:28:35.560 --> 2:28:40.120]  your book and they say yeah this guy hung out with the royal family this guy was like an undercover
[2:28:40.120 --> 2:28:45.320]  movie star with the elite uh you know this uh commando so you know he is who he says he was
[2:28:45.320 --> 2:28:50.840]  and you have the government records uh very much so and i i became very impressed with him
[2:28:50.840 --> 2:28:56.040]  not because of basically what he told me but by by by going in and researching him everything he
[2:28:56.040 --> 2:29:00.360]  told me was true so when we get to this point you know i've got to give him the benefit of the
[2:29:00.360 --> 2:29:06.520]  doubt when he told me about this but anyway uh patent uh as you've uh so ably described you
[2:29:06.520 --> 2:29:10.600]  know he wanted to go to war with the russians right then he was very pre-issued he saw what
[2:29:10.600 --> 2:29:15.480]  was going on uh there are so many motives you that's the word for patent he was prescient
[2:29:15.480 --> 2:29:21.080]  absolutely that's the key to a good general go ahead and he was fighting basically an
[2:29:21.080 --> 2:29:27.000]  administration which started with fdr and then by the time this happened with truman who was
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:33.080]  just following fdr's that loved the russians they wanted to do everything they could fdr called
[2:29:33.080 --> 2:29:40.440]  stollen uncle joe and and they were so blinded or worse because uh stollen just wanted as you know
[2:29:40.440 --> 2:29:45.960]  to take over the eastern europe and use it as a buffer and that's what he got and and and patent
[2:29:45.960 --> 2:29:51.240]  was just nuts over this he he had they thought he was nuts he was so mad because he's got a looting
[2:29:51.240 --> 2:29:57.640]  of the of the jewels of the western world as as gulag slaves and of course they they mentioned
[2:29:57.640 --> 2:30:02.440]  a line of it i haven't read your book yet a line about us prisoners i mean uh i haven't read your
[2:30:02.440 --> 2:30:07.800]  book yet is it in there about the 11 000 it is in there that was another thing that the patent was
[2:30:07.800 --> 2:30:14.120]  livid over uh you know once they took over those countries whatever whoever was in there including
[2:30:14.120 --> 2:30:19.240]  american soldiers they were just chucked off to the gulag and that is still an untold story i
[2:30:19.240 --> 2:30:25.320]  i believe that you can find books about it now some numbers say 22 000 but confirmed right at 12 000
[2:30:25.320 --> 2:30:30.920]  us soldiers who were in german camps the russians take them over and then our government just said
[2:30:30.920 --> 2:30:35.880]  screw our troops and patents like screw our troops so here he is getting in trouble for
[2:30:35.880 --> 2:30:41.640]  slapping cowards around uh you know to keep morale up uh because this guy's sniveling and crying
[2:30:42.360 --> 2:30:47.720]  and and but again using that as pr to make him look bad but meanwhile he actually really cared
[2:30:47.720 --> 2:30:53.400]  about the troops oh he cared terribly about them and and and it was worse than even what you've
[2:30:53.400 --> 2:31:00.040]  said i mean f dr squelched and told people that they could not talk this is f dr himself you know
[2:31:00.040 --> 2:31:07.160]  the the famous kateon massacre yes where the russians massacred most of the polish leadership
[2:31:07.160 --> 2:31:11.480]  so they could take over the country and then blamed it on the nazis well the russians have
[2:31:11.480 --> 2:31:16.120]  now admitted this in the last few years what had really happened that it was the russians
[2:31:16.120 --> 2:31:20.520]  and they don't dug up the bodies and there's even russian bayonets and bullets in them
[2:31:20.520 --> 2:31:24.440]  exactly well there's no question because the russians have admitted it now they've you know
[2:31:24.440 --> 2:31:30.440]  sort of a cleanse their soul type of thing that it did that it was us but at that time uh uh uh
[2:31:30.440 --> 2:31:37.400]  f dr would not allow the the the um uh records that he had commissioned he had an investigation
[2:31:37.400 --> 2:31:42.600]  to be uh made public because it it made the russians look bad that they had such a dirt bag
[2:31:42.600 --> 2:31:47.160]  and and and from what i've read i've read your book yet the last straw though was the 12 000
[2:31:47.160 --> 2:31:52.600]  troops going to death camps well uh i i i can't confirm that but that is the figure that i've
[2:31:52.600 --> 2:31:57.800]  heard too and i know that there were americans that were taken away well how dare patin not
[2:31:57.800 --> 2:32:03.800]  want to send us trips to russian camps for no reason he deserved to die he wasn't a good american
[2:32:03.800 --> 2:32:08.120]  and of course that's what wild bill said he said he's a great patriot but i need you to kill him
[2:32:08.120 --> 2:32:13.800]  yeah that was uh this is the culmination of a series of meetings that basata said he had which
[2:32:13.800 --> 2:32:20.120]  started with the stop patent and it's a it's a historical fact we know that when patin after
[2:32:20.120 --> 2:32:29.000]  he roared through france he was poised in 1944 in september to go into germany he would have
[2:32:29.000 --> 2:32:34.760]  ended that war in a month or two and imagine all the american lives that would have been saved
[2:32:34.760 --> 2:32:41.400]  well they stopped him because eisenhower who was a diplomat not a fighter not a lord uh he got he
[2:32:41.400 --> 2:32:48.600]  wanted um um um the the british to to uh you know the bridge too far a montgomery and he wanted
[2:32:48.600 --> 2:32:54.680]  montgomery to do this so they stopped patin at the german border and they took his gas this is a
[2:32:54.680 --> 2:32:59.000]  matter of historical record that's even the battle of the bolge movie and of course that's kind of
[2:32:59.000 --> 2:33:05.400]  the official spin they really wanted the soviets to get half the country well uh uh and and what
[2:33:05.400 --> 2:33:11.640]  happened afterwards i mean germany half of germany go ahead yeah because because patin couldn't go in
[2:33:11.640 --> 2:33:17.800]  there he had to go and stop the same germans who then were able to regroup and hit us at the batch
[2:33:17.800 --> 2:33:23.400]  battle of the bolge which was our worst defeat uh we lost more guys there than we did at d-day well
[2:33:23.400 --> 2:33:27.560]  riveting stay there sir we're gonna come right back to you and let you go to the book play by play
[2:33:27.560 --> 2:33:32.200]  here i know i'm interrupting a lot this is just such amazing history target patin is the book
[2:33:32.200 --> 2:33:40.920]  go go look you can buy it at amazon.com stay with us all right this is a short segment got a long
[2:33:40.920 --> 2:33:47.000]  one coming up so i want to hurry right back to our guest robert k wilcox wilcox author of target
[2:33:47.000 --> 2:33:54.680]  patin that's right he interviewed these special forces os s assassin all right let's go through
[2:33:54.680 --> 2:34:03.880]  with the start of stop patin discredit him attack him don't let him um race too fast because we got
[2:34:03.880 --> 2:34:08.520]  to let the soviets divide this in half we got to deal with them kind of like the nazi divided
[2:34:08.520 --> 2:34:17.320]  poland previously in 1939 continue well that uh stop patin order came out early and uh you know and
[2:34:17.320 --> 2:34:22.920]  it's a combination he was just a guy who spoke his mind uh he was too good for his own britches so
[2:34:22.920 --> 2:34:28.920]  to speak uh he was better than anybody else and he proved it he just roared through france and so
[2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:34.600]  they stopped him right there and uh what happened was the germans who will tell you themselves
[2:34:34.600 --> 2:34:40.440]  that they were in disarray and would have been defeated they then were able to regroup because
[2:34:40.440 --> 2:34:46.520]  he was running a blitzkrieg similar to what the desert fox would do but by holding them back
[2:34:46.520 --> 2:34:52.040]  that gave him time go ahead he traveled and and and took more ground than any commander ever in
[2:34:52.040 --> 2:34:57.240]  the history of the world at that time his tanks were rolling you know four five hundred miles
[2:34:57.240 --> 2:35:02.280]  in in three or four days well not three or four days but maybe in a week and it was just amazing
[2:35:02.280 --> 2:35:06.760]  and the germans were in disarray he had pushed them out of france they didn't know what to do
[2:35:06.760 --> 2:35:11.800]  they would have been beaten so it was a route it was a route big time and he couldn't believe
[2:35:11.800 --> 2:35:17.560]  that suddenly they're stopping him and they're giving the whole war to montgomery his arch rival
[2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:26.200]  uh and and and montgomery uh blew it again which he had done so many times uh and and and the the
[2:35:26.200 --> 2:35:33.640]  worst the germans were able to mount this uh this get to get get back together and mount a uh a a
[2:35:33.640 --> 2:35:41.480]  battle um uh of the um a battle of the bulge which almost kicked us out of of uh france but if it
[2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:48.680]  hadn't but there was patin right there and and uh uh eisenhower who had set this all up just you
[2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:51.640]  know he called his generals to get it and said what are we going to do what are we going to do
[2:35:51.640 --> 2:35:55.480]  they didn't know what to do but patin said i know what to do i'd already planned for it
[2:35:55.480 --> 2:36:02.360]  and he turned this huge third army all the way up up and and and stopped the battle of the bulge
[2:36:02.360 --> 2:36:08.520]  and beat the germans there and then was sent back into germany and he the worst thing that ever
[2:36:08.520 --> 2:36:15.560]  happened to him the day he cried literally was when he could not go to to berlin but the the
[2:36:15.560 --> 2:36:22.280]  the allies of um our sides decided to let the the russians come in as was all planned by by
[2:36:22.280 --> 2:36:27.640]  Stalin he had engineered all this and they took berlin and the rest of eastern europe and patin
[2:36:27.640 --> 2:36:34.280]  had to sit on the sidelines so um that that is probably in my opinion the biggest uh reason
[2:36:34.280 --> 2:36:40.840]  they uh that if he was killed and understand it is a mystery still to me but i i believe that i
[2:36:40.840 --> 2:36:47.320]  could go to a to a grand jury and get an indictment based on what we now know uh whether or not it
[2:36:47.320 --> 2:36:53.080]  would go to a conviction we'd have to let that play out but uh there's a lot more evidence here
[2:36:53.080 --> 2:36:58.680]  and uh when you're ready else i'll just start it off yeah let's go over uh what happened you know
[2:36:58.680 --> 2:37:04.680]  the the failed assassination attempt that wounded him and then the nkvd finishing the job yeah as i
[2:37:04.680 --> 2:37:09.160]  said when i first heard about this i i like most people thought that he had just died in a normal
[2:37:09.160 --> 2:37:14.680]  accident but then i i i studied the accident and it is it is really really mysterious it's
[2:37:14.680 --> 2:37:20.680]  the last day before patin is to leave there's already been three or four uh very very suspicious
[2:37:20.680 --> 2:37:25.960]  attempts on his life in my opinion which you'll read and then here's the last day he's decided
[2:37:25.960 --> 2:37:32.200]  to leave the army because they have strings on him so that he can go home and he's going to uh uh
[2:37:32.200 --> 2:37:37.640]  fight against the russians which of course is uh is anathema to the administration and he's also
[2:37:37.640 --> 2:37:43.240]  going to tell the secrets of how the war had been badly managed and and how so many americans died
[2:37:43.240 --> 2:37:48.360]  when they shouldn't have how he could have gone on and and and taken berlin so he's he's on this
[2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:56.440]  lonely road outside of manhain germany it's december ninth uh 1945 probably 60 years ago
[2:37:56.440 --> 2:38:03.160]  and uh it's just a lonely road and there's this uh army truck that's been waiting for him they stop
[2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:10.200]  at a uh at a railroad uh uh uh track and then they start up so they're not going very fast
[2:38:10.200 --> 2:38:15.880]  and the driver there's two other people in the car with patin uh another general who is his aid
[2:38:15.880 --> 2:38:21.240]  is on the left side patin's on the right side in the backseat they're in a catalac which is a limousine
[2:38:21.240 --> 2:38:25.880]  it's a big it's a big thing it's got a lot of leg room and there's a driver there and this driver
[2:38:25.880 --> 2:38:31.800]  notices this truck which starts up when they start up after the the um the railroad track
[2:38:31.800 --> 2:38:38.520]  and it just comes up slowly almost a breath and then suddenly without signaling turns in front of
[2:38:38.520 --> 2:38:44.440]  patin's car patin's driver tries to turn a little to the left they hit on the right hand side it's
[2:38:44.440 --> 2:38:52.760]  really a fender bender but but patin ends up with a broken neck uh tremendous uh cut on his face
[2:38:53.400 --> 2:38:57.800]  and the other two guys don't even move now this is strange why did this happen
[2:38:57.800 --> 2:39:03.480]  how could how could they have a a smash and two guys in the car don't get scratched stay there stay
[2:39:03.480 --> 2:39:11.720]  there by the way and declassified admitted mi6 and ci assassinations uh these staged auto accidents
[2:39:11.720 --> 2:39:17.080]  are their favorite they will kill you put you in a car and then smash your truck into it or they
[2:39:17.080 --> 2:39:22.360]  will smash your truck in it then kill you that's how they kill diana so a favorite way to kill
[2:39:22.360 --> 2:39:36.600]  we'll be right back stay with us this is the end beautiful friend
[2:39:40.920 --> 2:39:47.320]  this is the end my only friend the end
[2:39:47.320 --> 2:39:59.240]  the end of all of our beloved lives the end of everything that styles the end
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:07.160]  all right robert k wilcox author of target patents our guest look what we know is this it's in mainline
[2:40:07.160 --> 2:40:13.880]  history but there were at least 12 000 right at 12 000 some estimates are above 22 000 let's just
[2:40:13.880 --> 2:40:20.680]  say 12 000 us groups captured in poland captured in eastern germany and other areas captured uh
[2:40:20.680 --> 2:40:27.400]  out in the caucuses captured in syria what's syria today i mean he's a lot of these highly
[2:40:27.400 --> 2:40:34.040]  decorated special forces and people and what did they get for that ask dalin we love you we love
[2:40:34.040 --> 2:40:39.000]  what you're doing our bankers love you they love their your new world order we're going to uh just
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  let you keep those guys how's that sound a little present we'll never see their families again you'll
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:47.240]  work them to death torture them to get all our secrets that's okay because we love you
[2:40:48.200 --> 2:40:53.800]  and patin was hopping mad about that and he died uh now now so so he's in the car fender bender
[2:40:54.360 --> 2:40:59.880]  but in that second of the jolt that's a that's a secret service favorite they'll
[2:40:59.880 --> 2:41:03.960]  they'll have their patsy just shoot a 22 in the air and then they grab the president and pump the
[2:41:03.960 --> 2:41:09.000]  round in them up against him but side issue they love distractions they love sleight of hand
[2:41:09.000 --> 2:41:13.160]  that's how they killed your chakra bean they shot him in the car on the way to the hospital and
[2:41:13.160 --> 2:41:17.960]  we've interviewed the folks from the hospital the coroner the doctors everybody but uh let's
[2:41:17.960 --> 2:41:23.960]  continue with okay so show this truck pulls in front and they have a small fender bender uh
[2:41:23.960 --> 2:41:31.480]  with his Cadillac uh what happened next well everybody uh speculated uh when when when uh
[2:41:31.480 --> 2:41:40.760]  when the crash ends uh patin is laying on the the uh general next to him uh and he's got a
[2:41:40.760 --> 2:41:48.600]  a bloody face and he's got a broken neck the other guys are not even phased and uh to jump ahead
[2:41:48.600 --> 2:41:55.000]  a little bit um um douglas pazata the os s assassin said that he shot through the window a special
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:42:03.320]  air blown type uh gun that was specially made uh and he's behind a bunch of of uh old directs
[2:42:03.320 --> 2:42:10.440]  and so on which and they actually engineered a way this this um uh truck that that turned without
[2:42:10.440 --> 2:42:17.800]  without signaling uh set up a a firing lane for pazata and he shot what what amounted to a bolt
[2:42:17.800 --> 2:42:23.000]  that would not enter the body but would break the neck and that that's what pushed patin right
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  across this guy but nobody saw in the in the car what happened the general who was next to him was
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:35.480]  looking out the left hand window patin is looking out the right hand window and the driver's forward
[2:42:35.480 --> 2:42:41.560]  and the last thing patin says according to a memoir which i found is that look at that
[2:42:41.560 --> 2:42:46.200]  which makes you wonder what's he saying look at what look at what at a gun pointed at him at a guy
[2:42:46.200 --> 2:42:52.520]  shooting at him or what then bam the crash as you uh said uh in that instant boom there's the crash
[2:42:52.520 --> 2:42:58.920]  and then he's laying on top of the general well the general and the the uh driver all
[2:42:58.920 --> 2:43:05.400]  speculated without seeing that that patin had flown through the air in the car and had hit
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:13.080]  his head on the on a a um um uh you know a post that's that's in between the driver by the way
[2:43:13.080 --> 2:43:17.800]  that's what they said benazir budo died from then they released the video of her being machine gun
[2:43:17.800 --> 2:43:22.840]  and the bullets going they said she hit her head so that's it i hope nobody shoots me and i'm on
[2:43:22.840 --> 2:43:28.520]  tv being shot with bullets you know like scarface and they go oh look he hit his head that well
[2:43:28.520 --> 2:43:35.080]  that's that's so true and and this as you as you said uh this is the major number one way to kill
[2:43:35.080 --> 2:43:40.840]  people because an accident always looks like an accident and and even this bolt that he hit
[2:43:40.840 --> 2:43:47.160]  that he says he hit patin with in the face uh it goes into the wreckage and then you don't nobody
[2:43:47.160 --> 2:43:51.640]  thinks anything of it it's not a bullet it didn't enter his body and this kind of thing so it's so
[2:43:51.640 --> 2:43:56.520]  heavy a big bolt it hits you and then snaps the neck that's right and a caution weapon well that's
[2:43:56.520 --> 2:44:00.760]  what basata said you know i've never done it but that's it and i have to take him at his word you
[2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:07.400]  know this is part of of of the mystery of all this but anyway uh so they so the speculation was
[2:44:07.400 --> 2:44:13.080]  that he had somehow hit something and broken his neck that way well i can tell you i had an uh an
[2:44:13.080 --> 2:44:20.120]  accident investigator look at this scene and because of the way that the um car turned just
[2:44:20.120 --> 2:44:26.920]  before the hit patin would never have flown through the air the four yard four feet in the back of
[2:44:26.920 --> 2:44:33.720]  the car uh strictly uh longitudinally the the direction of the car when it hit would have made
[2:44:33.720 --> 2:44:41.400]  him hit just the window that he was looking at so uh that is false anyway but this is the story
[2:44:41.400 --> 2:44:46.760]  that has always gone down and all the historians just picked it up you know they write their great
[2:44:46.760 --> 2:44:53.400]  books about uh patin's life when it comes down to how he died do they want to spend another two years
[2:44:53.400 --> 2:44:57.880]  to investigate it like i did no and they didn't well what about the media though i mean i haven't
[2:44:57.880 --> 2:45:03.160]  seen the film in decades but don't they have a horse cart killing him well now this is i i mentioned
[2:45:03.160 --> 2:45:09.720]  earlier there were three or four instances but i think were attempts to kill him earlier uh and
[2:45:09.720 --> 2:45:15.160]  that is one of them in them in that famous film uh patin at the end there's a cart and this did
[2:45:15.160 --> 2:45:22.520]  happen uh he was in a jeep and a cart comes out of an alley these driving by and it has a scythe on
[2:45:22.520 --> 2:45:28.840]  it that's a long stick with a knife on it they use it to cut wheat with and this scythe just about
[2:45:28.840 --> 2:45:35.560]  cuts his head off but it misses him that's one of three attempts before what i'm talking about
[2:45:35.560 --> 2:45:40.120]  we never go over the other let's briefly go over the other attempt okay the other the earliest was
[2:45:40.120 --> 2:45:47.240]  uh another type jeep accident where he has just hit in a in a car and he's in a jeep and he is
[2:45:47.240 --> 2:45:50.920]  injured a little bit and this happened about three months before what i'm talking about
[2:45:50.920 --> 2:45:56.680]  but the most sensational one and the one which is really fishy is that uh right at the end of the
[2:45:56.680 --> 2:46:04.040]  war patin is flying in his piper cub and he's at a very low altitude and all of a sudden
[2:46:04.040 --> 2:46:10.680]  five spitfires which are supposedly polish and remember the russians have taken over poland
[2:46:10.680 --> 2:46:19.160]  at this time five polish spitfires uh uh see him and three or four of them circle while one of
[2:46:19.160 --> 2:46:27.720]  them goes down and starts shooting at patin's uh piper cub thank god the the um uh the the uh
[2:46:27.720 --> 2:46:33.960]  pilot of the piper cub is so good he's able to get so low and into the hills that the
[2:46:33.960 --> 2:46:41.400]  the uh uh spitfire uh crashes and this is all in in patin's diaries and they are live at what's
[2:46:41.400 --> 2:46:48.440]  going on here well that was uh in my opinion covered up by saying oh it was a mistake we didn't he
[2:46:48.440 --> 2:46:55.560]  was a young guy and he didn't realize it wasn't a nazi airplane well this is a little piper cub
[2:46:55.560 --> 2:47:00.040]  it's you can you're not going to think this is a nazi airplane and why are these four other guys
[2:47:00.040 --> 2:47:05.480]  circling up there sort of like uh watching you know they're the the signal guys so anyway
[2:47:05.480 --> 2:47:11.640]  this uh this ends in the death of the spitfire pilot and they didn't shoot him down and uh
[2:47:11.640 --> 2:47:18.120]  i think that those three incidents were moving up so was that soviets in the captured polish
[2:47:18.120 --> 2:47:23.960]  german spitfires you never know there are no records and this is a big part of the evidence
[2:47:23.960 --> 2:47:29.240]  here do you know that i've looked everywhere and there are no records on on the accident that
[2:47:29.240 --> 2:47:36.120]  i've described on the polish spitfire it's all gone and i'm not talking about two or three
[2:47:36.120 --> 2:47:41.720]  uh uh reports on the accident this mysterious accident that patin had i'm talking about at
[2:47:41.720 --> 2:47:49.640]  least five including an investigation and possibly eight and they are all gone now we know that he's
[2:47:49.640 --> 2:47:53.720]  in and of course cover up his evidence of the crime generally it is a cover up there's no question
[2:47:53.720 --> 2:47:58.680]  about so so so we have the motive patin's already saying he's going to go back and speak out against
[2:47:58.680 --> 2:48:04.600]  the soviets he's going to go back until congress kind of like uh we saw macarthur do later secrets
[2:48:04.600 --> 2:48:08.440]  yeah yeah he's going to tell secrets he knows they're helping the soviets he knows they took
[2:48:08.440 --> 2:48:13.640]  12 000 us troops you know he's going to blow the whistle uh he's going to destroy the future
[2:48:13.640 --> 2:48:19.160]  presidential chances of dwight d eisenhower absolutely that can't be allowed and the soviets
[2:48:19.160 --> 2:48:23.960]  don't like him you know they want america to go quietly into the night and and go along with uncle
[2:48:23.960 --> 2:48:29.320]  jode already killed 40 something million people by by by that time let's go through what they cover
[2:48:29.320 --> 2:48:33.800]  in the london telegraph and then you know what's in your book target patin about you know the
[2:48:33.800 --> 2:48:41.240]  collusion so but it doesn't kill him he's alive in the hospital what comes next um uh he goes to
[2:48:41.240 --> 2:48:46.280]  the hospital and uh he's going to die everybody thinks he's going to die i mean this is a bad
[2:48:46.280 --> 2:48:53.560]  thing he's he's uh um uh can't move from the neck down but he's a tough guy and he rallies and uh
[2:48:53.560 --> 2:48:58.600]  within a week and a half he's doing so well there are twitches in his fingers and his legs
[2:48:58.600 --> 2:49:02.840]  and they they're going to move him they're going to fly him back to boston which is no easy trip
[2:49:02.840 --> 2:49:08.840]  at that time which shows you how how well he had he had become and suddenly he has a downturn and
[2:49:08.840 --> 2:49:16.760]  within 14 hours he's dead and um a bazaar out says that uh it was the nkvd that went in there and
[2:49:16.760 --> 2:49:24.840]  used a poison on him the the cause of death was embolism uh which is a sort of a blood clot going
[2:49:24.840 --> 2:49:32.520]  through your brain through your uh yeah but um uh there there's no autopsy done on patent so we
[2:49:32.520 --> 2:49:38.040]  don't really know what happened to him and uh recently one of the family members of the
[2:49:38.040 --> 2:49:43.160]  patents was actually approached by a russian who said i want to tell you some information
[2:49:43.160 --> 2:49:47.320]  and uh putting it putting it all together and to be real succinct about it i think that they
[2:49:47.320 --> 2:49:52.920]  used a poison that mimics uh this that then they can do that and they were doing both the oss and
[2:49:53.880 --> 2:50:02.200]  the nkvd had had labs where they made these kinds of poisons which would uh mimic a natural cause
[2:50:02.200 --> 2:50:08.680]  of death now again the nkvd was the internal apparatus for keeping control of the soviet
[2:50:08.680 --> 2:50:13.960]  union and it was uh being brought into western europe at that time and specifically let's get into
[2:50:13.960 --> 2:50:19.960]  that uh wild bill donovan then made a deal uh i mean go specifically through what the assassin
[2:50:19.960 --> 2:50:26.920]  told you about this uh and then uh continue well uh uh even you know not many people know
[2:50:26.920 --> 2:50:35.480]  that the oss and the nkvd were in collusion they early on in the war uh donovan flew to russia
[2:50:35.480 --> 2:50:41.800]  and proposed that the two of them work together which was a good idea at that time i mean the the
[2:50:41.800 --> 2:50:48.040]  russians were fighting the the nazis and you know donovan is a very enigmatic man perhaps the most
[2:50:48.040 --> 2:50:54.360]  enigmatic of all in in in world war two and he was a guy who would take a chance he you know he'd
[2:50:54.360 --> 2:50:59.160]  make a deal with the devil he's the guy that flew bombers off an aircraft carrier to bomb tokyo
[2:50:59.160 --> 2:51:05.800]  yeah i think he's probably his idea i'm not certain about that but anyway uh he went there
[2:51:05.800 --> 2:51:12.040]  and he made a deal with the nkvd now let me say that the nkvd just played him for a fool
[2:51:12.040 --> 2:51:19.880]  because they already had so many spies in america right up to the white house we were inundated with
[2:51:19.880 --> 2:51:25.240]  in the in the state department and and so you know mccarthy uh whatever his methods were
[2:51:25.240 --> 2:51:29.160]  he didn't know the half of it and we know well when mccarthy was useful
[2:51:29.160 --> 2:51:33.720]  to set up a police state when he was just going after little pincos when he found out that the
[2:51:33.720 --> 2:51:38.440]  army was basically running russia and if you really study this sounds like you're pretty educated
[2:51:38.440 --> 2:51:43.000]  that communism was only a fake system of the of the anglo-american empire as the head of
[2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:47.080]  georgetown political science carol quigley bill clinton's mentor said they wanted to work with
[2:51:47.080 --> 2:51:52.440]  fascist and communist as the millner group in england said about a hundred years ago what 98
[2:51:52.440 --> 2:52:00.280]  years ago that they wanted to to to to work with tyrannical regimes uh and so bottom line
[2:52:00.280 --> 2:52:07.480]  that's why the us in england put malin put linen in put all these people in was you know kind of
[2:52:07.480 --> 2:52:12.440]  these fake counter revolutions that look like they're for the people uh but they really aren't
[2:52:12.440 --> 2:52:17.960]  and so you know uh as long as he was saying it was a communist threat from russia to take over
[2:52:17.960 --> 2:52:24.440]  america that was fine when really that's but backwards uh it was the globalist that we know
[2:52:24.440 --> 2:52:30.200]  of today who are actually finger puppeting the soviets go ahead well alex you're really ahead
[2:52:30.200 --> 2:52:35.560]  of me on that one i uh you know an awful lot about that but what i do know is that venona
[2:52:35.560 --> 2:52:41.640]  which was our breaking of the russian codes during world war two and which has been kept
[2:52:41.640 --> 2:52:48.280]  secret until just recently now shows us that there were there were many many many hundreds
[2:52:48.280 --> 2:52:55.640]  of spies in our uh in our government apparatus russian spies who were telling style and daily
[2:52:55.640 --> 2:53:02.440]  what was going on so going back to the os s collusion with the nk vd uh they didn't really
[2:53:02.440 --> 2:53:08.200]  need it but they went ahead with it because it served their purposes and and they played donovan
[2:53:08.200 --> 2:53:14.200]  like a marionette but again do you see how the western overarching uh angle american empire
[2:53:14.200 --> 2:53:22.360]  used its soviet base as a system to send in spies that were untraceable with even the nk vd k gb spies
[2:53:23.080 --> 2:53:29.160]  in the case of the us not even knowing they were under the control of the larger system well that
[2:53:29.160 --> 2:53:33.000]  certainly could be true i i just don't know any more than what i've done here you know i mean when
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:36.600]  mccarthy found out about it that's when they blew him away well i mean that's when they politically
[2:53:36.600 --> 2:53:42.440]  shut him down there are probably 20 books here you know to to detail all this but uh all i could
[2:53:42.440 --> 2:53:46.840]  really talk about his patent and what happened to him and you know we haven't spoken about one thing
[2:53:46.840 --> 2:53:56.200]  and that is that on the on the nk vd side i i i tracked down a uh a a uh uh american agent who
[2:53:56.200 --> 2:54:03.880]  was with patents armies he was a c i c agent a counterintelligence agency and uh his job was to
[2:54:03.880 --> 2:54:11.320]  find uh these kinds of plots and he was dealing with the russians and he found out that stalin had
[2:54:11.320 --> 2:54:20.040]  put a patent on a a a a a death list a hit list and so he went back and uh he he tried to stop this
[2:54:20.600 --> 2:54:26.360]  and he had to deal with with wild bill donovan this is all written in this man's book i did not speak
[2:54:26.360 --> 2:54:32.360]  to him he died but i found his book which was really written for his children they gave it to me and
[2:54:32.360 --> 2:54:39.320]  it is an amazing amazing document and it talks all about this and um through three different sources
[2:54:39.320 --> 2:54:46.120]  at three different times this agent who had been with uh with patent and was in germany at that time
[2:54:46.120 --> 2:54:54.200]  as was bizarre at the time of patent's death he was run out by by uh donovan under threat of his
[2:54:54.200 --> 2:55:00.440]  of his life and he had to live live here uh that way for many years he eventually came out of that
[2:55:00.440 --> 2:55:09.320]  and became a a republican um uh staffer type and uh he worked for uh reagan and some others
[2:55:09.320 --> 2:55:16.600]  both pazara and uh this other agent uh uh steven schubick are two great great witnesses in this
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:23.800]  they they they really have a lot of credibility and so on that side on the russian side um schubick
[2:55:23.800 --> 2:55:30.120]  found out that they had this plan that they were working with the os s to kill patent tried to stop
[2:55:30.120 --> 2:55:37.720]  it and was run out of of germany under threat of his life just unbelievably amazing um and when
[2:55:37.720 --> 2:55:43.320]  when you were talking to the assassin uh you know why was he telling you he was going public about
[2:55:43.320 --> 2:55:49.720]  this well that's a great question um he never would have gotten gone public but as he came back
[2:55:49.720 --> 2:55:56.680]  as i mentioned earlier uh he'd been promised a great job with the cia nobody knew him he had to
[2:55:56.680 --> 2:56:04.200]  fight for his benefits um so they they screwed him they screwed him royally and he began to
[2:56:04.200 --> 2:56:10.520]  see things that he had always kept quiet be put out in books and so he became really really uh
[2:56:10.520 --> 2:56:18.040]  dissonant you know disenchanted with the whole situation and so he actually did um in 1979
[2:56:18.040 --> 2:56:28.040]  make a uh a statement to uh to the spotlight which was a newspaper which is no longer around it was
[2:56:28.040 --> 2:56:35.560]  in uh it's now american free press yes and in that statement he said i know who killed patent
[2:56:35.560 --> 2:56:41.960]  because i was given money to do so it wasn't me but i know who did it and this was his first act
[2:56:41.960 --> 2:56:47.400]  of kind of uh i'm tired of this you know i'm not going to sit on this any longer and because he
[2:56:47.400 --> 2:56:53.960]  his father by the way was a uh presbyterian minister of of great uh reputation uh in in new
[2:56:53.960 --> 2:57:00.920]  jersey and he had a lot of pangs about that living the life that he had as a um as an assassin
[2:57:00.920 --> 2:57:06.360]  for many many years for his government uh he just had to get this out of him and when he had the stroke
[2:57:06.360 --> 2:57:12.040]  that that finally broke down his barriers and i came along and he began to tell me this whole
[2:57:12.040 --> 2:57:20.440]  thing that's right as we prepare to go across the river sticks a lot of people finally have that
[2:57:20.440 --> 2:57:25.080]  courage to tell the truth and get the wickedness off their chest will you do it before you die
[2:57:25.080 --> 2:57:49.320]  this is not america patent refused to be quiet about 12 000 us trips captured by the soviets
[2:57:49.320 --> 2:57:56.440]  out of german prisoner of war camps going to slave gulags few of them escaped and books are
[2:57:56.440 --> 2:58:01.080]  written about the subject there's been mainstream news shows about it but they claimed the u.s didn't
[2:58:01.080 --> 2:58:06.920]  know no the u.s newland could care less about those troops that's how evil the government was then
[2:58:08.200 --> 2:58:13.560]  can you imagine how bad they are now sir i want to have you back up for a full hour in the next
[2:58:13.560 --> 2:58:17.080]  few weeks after the new year just to take calls from listeners and all the angles they're going
[2:58:17.080 --> 2:58:21.320]  to cover i'm going to get your book target patent i know it's available at amazon.com and
[2:58:21.320 --> 2:58:27.640]  bookstores everywhere and i hope people will get it in closing we got about two minutes left other
[2:58:27.640 --> 2:58:35.080]  key points you haven't gotten to not really i think we've covered well yes there is one great one
[2:58:36.200 --> 2:58:43.240]  the fake car i thought that i would go and to the patent museum where they have the car they say
[2:58:43.240 --> 2:58:49.400]  that patent was injured in and i would be able to at last you know sort of see the crime scene and
[2:58:49.400 --> 2:58:57.400]  see what happened there well i took a uh uh an expert from um uh from detroit on catalac specifically
[2:58:57.400 --> 2:59:07.000]  that catalac the 1938 catalac limousine 7533 is what it's technically called and uh we found out
[2:59:07.000 --> 2:59:15.880]  that that is not the car it's a it it it's a 1939 car that has been rebuilt and uh the the major
[2:59:15.880 --> 2:59:22.040]  discovery was that you know a venn number you can find you can take a venn even today uh it's a
[2:59:22.040 --> 2:59:29.720]  vehicle identification number it's soldered into the uh the chassis and every car has it and uh
[2:59:29.720 --> 2:59:39.240]  and uh this venn number was scraped out so there's no question that uh somebody wanted um the museum
[2:59:39.240 --> 2:59:46.680]  to think that it was the real car which they did but it is not the real car so 1939 so more evidence
[2:59:46.680 --> 2:59:50.680]  of cover up we're gonna have to have you back do you want to fire out your specific website mr
