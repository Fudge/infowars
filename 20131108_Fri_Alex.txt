[00:00.000 --> 00:13.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.560 --> 00:41.360]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen

[01:06.640 --> 01:14.320]  Maloof who's got a lot of a major connections to public Brigadier and Major Generals who
[01:14.320 --> 01:20.080]  are going public about the purging of the military he's going to be joining us for about 30
[01:20.080 --> 01:26.800]  minutes in the start of the third hour today obviously I don't have to tell you how important
[01:26.800 --> 01:36.040]  that Intel is and we're going to be adding our research and source info to his info to try to
[01:36.040 --> 01:42.400]  brainstorm exactly what we're facing here you know the times have gotten so serious and so insane
[01:42.400 --> 01:49.080]  that I am actually calm right now that's how freaked out I am beyond even being angry and I
[01:49.080 --> 01:55.240]  just have this deep feeling of not wanting this disaster to get any worse I don't hate any of the
[01:55.240 --> 02:03.440]  government bureaucrats I don't hate any of the police I don't hate any of the general public I do
[02:03.440 --> 02:06.840]  not like the globalists who are consciously manipulating all of us and if we would just
[02:06.840 --> 02:13.440]  learn how they manipulate us and become aware of the technologies of tyranny then we could move
[02:13.440 --> 02:20.640]  towards a freer society it's simple your society is based on liberty and innovation and honor and
[02:20.640 --> 02:28.840]  truthfulness and insanity or it's based on manipulation and gangs and corruption and fraud
[02:28.840 --> 02:38.120]  and betrayal and I just really this morning it hit me like a ton of bricks that that is what's
[02:38.120 --> 02:46.280]  going on here it hit me like a ton of bricks that that we're seeing insanity in government
[02:46.280 --> 02:53.400]  insanity in the media insanity in corporations insanity in individuals and most people are
[02:53.400 --> 03:01.800]  just freaked out and upset and don't know how to survive it's like the public is sinking into a
[03:01.800 --> 03:08.040]  sea and I have have just gone out and read the globalists their own statements their criminal
[03:08.040 --> 03:21.200]  arrogance it's the criminology 101 that criminals love to brag it is their criminality and their
[03:21.200 --> 03:28.320]  arrogance that is going to end up bringing them down and and maybe all of us but criminology 101
[03:28.320 --> 03:37.200]  is that criminals love to brag and they brag about their exploits in our face that's how we
[03:37.200 --> 03:43.200]  know exactly what they're doing and that's what really the root of my frustration is that I live
[03:43.200 --> 03:49.560]  with this I know it's real I know I'm right I wish I wasn't right and it's like living in a
[03:49.560 --> 03:55.120]  twilight zone episode and I just I just want people to do well I just want to have justice I
[03:55.120 --> 04:04.000]  want to be happy I want to be able to believe in institutions but it's buying into the fraud
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.680]  that is enabled it to get so bad so I think really in the final equation I could almost not even
[04:10.680 --> 04:15.280]  speak about 30 seconds ago because it hit me understanding on top of understanding that we
[04:15.280 --> 04:21.480]  have to repent and even if you don't believe in God the social engineers get God out of the equation
[04:21.480 --> 04:26.640]  or a higher power out of the equation so that they can be the higher power and they're mad men
[04:26.640 --> 04:31.440]  who are control freaks and are not the God we need to be worshiping if that's the thing like
[04:31.440 --> 04:40.000]  Bob Dylan says you're gonna serve somebody and the God of corruption and fraud is not the God I
[04:40.000 --> 04:46.040]  want to follow I can make that summation and I really want to say to everybody I don't think you
[04:46.040 --> 04:52.120]  want to follow the God of fraud the God of betrayal the God of lies I want to follow the God of
[04:52.120 --> 05:01.120]  life and justice honor and strength and purity and blessings we'll be right back a little over a
[05:01.120 --> 05:06.640]  year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I
[05:06.640 --> 05:11.880]  was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we
[05:11.880 --> 05:16.120]  grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[05:16.120 --> 05:21.720]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies
[05:21.720 --> 05:28.080]  need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best vitamin
[05:28.080 --> 05:33.600]  and mineral company out there and discovered young Jevity the young Jevity products are designed

[07:59.200 --> 08:16.800]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[08:16.800 --> 08:33.600]  my friends you've got front row seats to the 21st century you've got front row seats to
[08:35.520 --> 08:37.520]  a time of unparalleled change
[08:37.520 --> 08:52.480]  in the species and our history on this planet i immersed myself in news analysis and how the
[08:52.480 --> 09:03.840]  world really works not how we want it to work and the prognosis for this country and this world
[09:03.840 --> 09:12.560]  is designed controlled collapse into a
[09:16.160 --> 09:24.880]  amalgamation between post industrial systems with high tech reservations with global diplomatic
[09:24.880 --> 09:34.480]  community above the law breakaway civilization and that is what we face it's a lesion right here
[09:34.480 --> 09:42.400]  on the planet here's off the grid news walmart's safeway others unplugging from unreliable power grid
[09:43.040 --> 09:50.160]  creating their own power stations and power systems this has always been the model this has
[09:50.160 --> 09:58.320]  always been the plan and then meanwhile they bring in systems and regulations to try to stop the
[09:58.320 --> 10:03.680]  general public from actually being off the grid but part of a larger control grabber they can
[10:03.680 --> 10:09.120]  tax you and control you and do whatever they want because there is no lobby for the individual if
[10:09.120 --> 10:15.280]  the individual will not stand up and resist oppression and tyranny everywhere they see it
[10:15.280 --> 10:21.200]  it's real simple you either act like a free person behave like a free person to be a free person
[10:21.200 --> 10:29.600]  or you act like a subservient compliant cowardly decadent slave and you will be a cowardly dumb
[10:29.600 --> 10:40.880]  down decadent impoverished slave here's another one out of the wall street journal companies
[10:40.880 --> 10:49.840]  unplug from electric grid delivering a jolt to utilities yes so this is the model of the
[10:49.840 --> 10:56.480]  reservation corporate reservation that glenn beck shows what a visionary he is understanding this
[10:57.040 --> 11:02.640]  and i mean that in a serious way when he says he wants to build a liberty city
[11:02.640 --> 11:12.080]  and and you know whether that would turn into a sinkhole or not it's it's a whatever becomes
[11:12.080 --> 11:19.120]  of it it's a bold idea because that's fashioning itself off of what the elite is doing and they're
[11:19.120 --> 11:26.160]  going back to the city state see globalism is ten regions three mega regions the sub countries
[11:26.160 --> 11:30.640]  destroyed and brought into larger mega regions of impoverishment this is the official plan
[11:30.640 --> 11:40.560]  and within mega cities that are controlled but are allowed to be industrialized
[11:42.320 --> 11:46.560]  and then just large swaths that are deindustrialized and post-industrial
[11:46.560 --> 11:53.680]  and then very small super high tech high security reservations for the elite
[11:53.680 --> 12:05.920]  and austin texas has been chosen uh as one of the new mega city centers officially by the united
[12:05.920 --> 12:14.800]  nations and it's it's the first city in the u.s to have after dc following that model uh where
[12:14.800 --> 12:18.400]  they're going to have different power rates depending on what area you live in the government
[12:18.400 --> 12:24.000]  district uh i don't mean the capital i mean certain neighborhoods and and and the capital as well or
[12:24.560 --> 12:30.240]  exempt from power outages and uh exempt from rate increases and things like that i mean this is an
[12:30.240 --> 12:37.840]  absolute screw job of screw jobs and yeah i've got all this news in front of me here today it it's
[12:37.840 --> 12:47.440]  just unbelievable to really watch this happen huh and and and and we know exactly how it's
[12:47.440 --> 12:53.920]  going to roll out how it's going to unfold uh the f a a has announced um that they're
[12:54.480 --> 13:03.440]  authorizing the launch of 7 000 plus drones of 30 000 that are going to be launched by uh 2020
[13:03.440 --> 13:12.720]  but they're now authorizing and preparing and have the uh the federal filings for 7 500 drones
[13:12.720 --> 13:18.000]  now you have to remember uh this is in the washington times today you have to remember
[13:18.000 --> 13:24.640]  that just last year uh the associated press and a bunch of other publications came out and said
[13:24.640 --> 13:31.600]  this does not exist you understand that and of course they attacked us and and said that uh we
[13:31.600 --> 13:45.760]  uh we were liars said that uh we were we were um making it all up and you see that's really painful
[13:45.760 --> 13:51.520]  because that means with all their NSA spying and their psychological algorithm uh
[13:51.520 --> 14:00.320]  uh profiles of the general public they think they can launch drones publicly
[14:01.840 --> 14:09.200]  and then separately say that we're lying about it and and and and almost use us like a simulated
[14:09.200 --> 14:14.480]  adversary because they're admitting everywhere they're doing it in local papers but selling it
[14:14.480 --> 14:19.520]  like it's a good idea i come out and say it's a bad idea and then it's the military industrial
[14:19.520 --> 14:24.800]  complex taking over weaponizing things it just bring the police and military out of the equation
[14:24.800 --> 14:31.600]  where it'll all be automated uh autonomous which is the technocrats dream of taking soldiers out
[14:31.600 --> 14:38.080]  of the equation that might refuse unlawful or immoral orders and so it was because i said it
[14:38.080 --> 14:43.360]  was a bad idea and pointed out what was really planned they didn't address that and say no it's
[14:43.360 --> 14:49.200]  good to have drones weaponized drones surveilling you and blimps and everything else they just said
[14:49.200 --> 14:56.240]  it doesn't exist while simultaneously rolling it out in thousands of publications thousands
[14:57.040 --> 15:02.240]  per week at that time how great the drones were so we're rolling this all out to surveil you and
[15:02.240 --> 15:10.240]  kill you but it doesn't exist if you don't like it and that's the exact same psychology of there is
[15:10.240 --> 15:14.240]  no new world order insane people believe there's a world government being set up run by private
[15:14.240 --> 15:19.120]  mega banks but you open time magazine of it and it's bank of the world welcome to the new world
[15:19.120 --> 15:24.800]  government run by banks it's a new world order and i'm like well i don't want to be under that that
[15:24.800 --> 15:29.200]  i don't like these banks being exempt from taxes while raising mine to destroy me not even to
[15:29.200 --> 15:34.400]  transfer the money to themselves and they're just like no that doesn't exist you're crazy
[15:35.040 --> 15:40.400]  abc nightly news there is no move for corporate world government well here i have 20 news articles
[15:40.400 --> 15:45.920]  admitting it financial times i don't want to look at it alex it doesn't exist well yes it does
[15:45.920 --> 15:50.560]  no i say it doesn't exist and so i said to the guy right out there i said you're a military soldier
[15:51.520 --> 15:58.240]  on one side and i'm on the other you really know all this he goes basically let's go to dinner
[15:58.800 --> 16:04.160]  i got a family this is my job yes that's your job and at dinner we're just like yeah it's a crazy
[16:04.160 --> 16:10.640]  world and i'm just sitting there going you really it's just it's so sick it's just it's just so so
[16:10.640 --> 16:21.600]  sick and i've had some success just because i've gotten upset which is a normal response and so it
[16:21.600 --> 16:30.000]  kind of got people out of their their doldrums but i really do think the broadcast obviously i
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.560]  can't control myself i'll still rant sometimes mainly when i'm tired it's a crutch but we need to
[16:34.560 --> 16:41.680]  move just into the the real analysis so that there's a real testament a real uh chronicle
[16:43.040 --> 16:50.640]  of what happened in these years uh because we'll we'll be blessed if we don't end up showing the
[16:50.640 --> 16:55.360]  whole planet and everybody dies i mean if you really look at the way the establishment's acting
[16:55.360 --> 17:00.640]  and things they're doing they are completely out of control and they spend all day trying
[17:00.640 --> 17:08.560]  to dumb us down and control us when they are just completely absolutely totally becoming
[17:08.560 --> 17:16.160]  more and more megalomaniacal and narcissistic nihilistic destructive and if you've studied the
[17:16.160 --> 17:25.120]  the the criminology of elites throughout history we know exactly where this leads next and i
[17:25.120 --> 17:35.120]  just i just don't think even the people running the system in the in the final equation subconsciously
[17:38.160 --> 17:45.360]  understand at a conscious level where their subconscious is taking them and taking us by
[17:45.360 --> 17:52.160]  the way because they think they can skirt things and and take risk and do all this and not destroy
[17:52.160 --> 17:56.720]  everything and they say but it doesn't matter if they destroy everything at least they went on willing
[17:56.720 --> 18:02.240]  that's a top globalist futurist quote uh that they might decide to destroy the earth actually i
[18:02.240 --> 18:08.080]  guess they do know actually just to just to do it like that's their greatest work their uh
[18:09.200 --> 18:18.000]  their great their their their magnum opus their masterwork i guess the devil is never a maker
[18:18.000 --> 18:24.400]  unless that this system gives it's a taker now i got a bunch of news we'll get to when we come back but
[18:26.160 --> 18:30.400]  none of us are perfect and i'm not judging anybody but it's time to repent
[18:32.640 --> 18:43.520]  it's time to get back to god it's time to try to purify ourselves and it's time to also challenge
[18:43.520 --> 18:49.840]  the corruption around us it's our only hope and it's also our only fulfillment we were made to do
[18:49.840 --> 18:54.480]  this there's always a struggle between good and evil and we were just convinced by the power
[18:54.480 --> 18:58.960]  structure that there is no evil well that's the devil's greatest trick there are no drones
[18:58.960 --> 19:04.560]  there is no healthcare increase uh there are no death panels the government's not chipping the
[19:04.560 --> 19:10.160]  drugs in uh on and on and on it's just it's all a big line and and and it's meant just to have you
[19:10.160 --> 19:15.920]  deny it the lie is just there for lazy people who know it's all true just so they can say oh no i heard
[19:15.920 --> 19:21.920]  that is it true when they know deep down it is true like if you were drinking you know a ton of alcohol
[19:21.920 --> 19:25.600]  every day lying to yourself and saying i can keep doing this and it's not going to hurt my liver
[19:29.840 --> 19:37.520]  it's a it's a denial and we need to stop living in denial all of us and and and i
[19:37.520 --> 19:43.360]  i don't want to live in denial and i repent for all the bad things i've done to people
[19:44.240 --> 19:49.120]  even though i try to be pure of heart and i'm over all the good person i am wicked and i repent
[19:49.120 --> 19:57.600]  before god and throw myself on his mercy humbly and ask that god cleanse me we'll be right back on

[23:53.520 --> 23:55.760]  with my patriot supply today
[23:55.760 --> 24:06.240]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[24:06.240 --> 24:29.440]  alex jones here backline the reason i'm cogitating on just the the the the overall
[24:29.440 --> 24:37.760]  state of the world is because i can see the breakdown of society not just in the media but
[24:37.760 --> 24:47.280]  personally and in life and in business dealings you name it i just really see insanity and recklessness
[24:47.280 --> 24:59.680]  uh increasing and crime had been dropping for 40 i don't know since 1992 so 20 years
[25:02.320 --> 25:10.400]  and was going back towards levels that were seen in the 50s and 40s before the big
[25:10.400 --> 25:18.480]  big crime waves that were brought on by the government importing massive amounts of drugs
[25:18.480 --> 25:21.920]  into the country in the 60s 70s 80s 90s right through till now
[25:25.840 --> 25:35.360]  but i am genuinely genuinely concerned because there's no way that obama and the globalist
[25:35.360 --> 25:41.760]  would be engaged in the open looting of the american people the way they are right now
[25:41.760 --> 25:49.040]  unless they were planning something massive in the future it may be a huge war they've already
[25:49.040 --> 25:54.800]  tried to expand what's happening in the middle east it could be a mother of all false flags
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.960]  i i think in my analysis one one one failing has i haven't thought big enough
[26:00.960 --> 26:09.120]  i mean there's no telling what these people will do and i i just want stability in the future
[26:11.200 --> 26:14.960]  they could start a civil war they're definitely pushing for that so they definitely want that
[26:16.640 --> 26:20.240]  the power structure could start a large war that could lead to something along the lines
[26:20.240 --> 26:24.080]  of world war three all the top analysts concur that's definitely in the cards
[26:24.080 --> 26:29.760]  father pentagon says no we're not gonna attack iran no no we just can't do it and by the way
[26:29.760 --> 26:34.400]  iran has nuclear weapons folks everybody gets mad when i say that and says why are you promoting
[26:34.400 --> 26:42.880]  war with iran i'm not promoting war with iran i don't want to have war with iran
[26:44.800 --> 26:51.120]  but from my high level military sources is they've had nukes that they got from pakistan
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.200]  for a decade
[26:53.200 --> 27:00.480]  and that's why there's all this double crossing and the u.s trying to overthrow pakistan
[27:01.680 --> 27:06.640]  with al-qaeda forces knowing our public's so dumb they wouldn't understand it it just
[27:06.640 --> 27:14.320]  really gets into sophisticated fourth fifth dimensional warfare multi-level and
[27:14.320 --> 27:20.160]  and the warfare is so sophisticated
[27:22.240 --> 27:30.240]  and nuance that that that it doesn't work now it works for the contractors to make money
[27:31.680 --> 27:39.680]  the big companies to make money but that's why that's why the the the dark logic of these people
[27:39.680 --> 27:47.280]  is that it's it's it's full spectrum war against everybody including themselves it's just
[27:48.320 --> 27:52.960]  and they fool themselves that they're creators but all they're creating is destruction
[27:54.880 --> 28:00.160]  and i don't think that's creation at all because they're not even building something back on top
[28:00.160 --> 28:07.440]  of it it just cycles down into more and more destruction i'll come back and go into the
[28:07.440 --> 28:14.080]  nose it's just that i'm having a lot deeper of an understanding of all this and i've had these
[28:14.080 --> 28:17.360]  understandings for a long time and a lot of you have the same understanding it's just fact it's
[28:17.360 --> 28:29.200]  veritas it's just that i marvel at the evil i just marvel it's so anti-human it's so anti-woman
[28:29.200 --> 28:37.440]  it's so anti-man it's so anti-child it's so anti-beauty and i've known this for a long time but
[28:37.440 --> 28:44.560]  the CIA tried to put out ugly art that was pointless to screw people up and to degrade good
[28:45.360 --> 28:52.400]  what was seen as virtuous art that was known to uplift people until now the general public
[28:52.400 --> 28:59.280]  thinks ugliness and discordia is is beautiful and you could argue and say how dare you say this
[28:59.280 --> 29:04.400]  modern art is bad i'm not even saying that i'm saying the type they tried to promote and the
[29:04.400 --> 29:12.800]  reason they promoted it was to screw people up and to get rid of art previously had been mainly
[29:12.800 --> 29:19.840]  political and very powerful and so people's expression was about the world and the world
[29:19.840 --> 29:23.280]  they wanted to build well they don't want you thinking of a world you want to build they want
[29:23.280 --> 29:27.440]  you thinking about the sitcom the football game and then they build the world they want which is a
[29:27.440 --> 29:34.880]  hellhole all right we're gonna go to break i'm gonna come back i've got obama just just absolutely
[29:34.880 --> 29:40.400]  imploding in front of everyone but this is all by design and then we're gonna get into the standard

[33:40.720 --> 33:42.480]  based on strength honor and virtue
[33:45.600 --> 33:50.320]  then they become fat and happy and decadent and corrupt and then more and more corruption moves
[33:50.320 --> 33:56.240]  into the centers of power until you have a concentration of evil and then the weight of
[33:56.240 --> 34:04.720]  the compounding fraud and and arrogance and narcissism and mental illness and unaccountability
[34:04.720 --> 34:14.240]  builds like like the pressure of a mountain on coal and forms it into a diamond of wickedness pure
[34:14.240 --> 34:32.560]  pure tyranny pure death pure fraud pure betrayal total evil
[34:37.360 --> 34:42.320]  and i will get to the news now and then open the phones up and take your phone calls i just
[34:42.320 --> 34:51.040]  the magnitude more and more just hits me of how real all this is and i don't want this to be real
[34:51.040 --> 34:58.640]  i wish i was wrong i've had people say how dare you say 9-11's an inside job you anti-american
[34:58.640 --> 35:03.760]  piece of garbage how dare you and now of course it's come out the government runs al-qaeda the
[35:03.760 --> 35:08.720]  evidence is overwhelming 9-11 was a stand down bare minimum with protection of the supposed
[35:08.720 --> 35:15.440]  hijackers who are u.s. government cia officers they weren't just assets folks they were officers
[35:16.240 --> 35:23.040]  they were they were operatives that's on record least five of them
[35:25.680 --> 35:29.040]  and i've been on these radio shows and they go you're gonna have to face god
[35:30.560 --> 35:38.320]  i was on a show on what was it ktsa from new york there was a santanio station i was on there for
[35:38.320 --> 35:44.160]  about 30 minutes i'll never forget i was sitting in this garden outside this church about an hour
[35:44.160 --> 35:48.320]  before a rally was going to start there for 9-11 truth and there was nobody around and i was on
[35:48.320 --> 35:57.840]  my cell phone and uh it was the wear pair i think it was like a dad and a son and he said well i see
[35:57.840 --> 36:01.680]  that there is some evidence like you say but it's really hard to believe and if you're right we're
[36:01.680 --> 36:07.600]  in deep trouble but he goes you but you listen to me and it was because he was direct he talked to me
[36:07.600 --> 36:12.960]  like a human being not like someone trying to phrase an argument to win it he said you're
[36:12.960 --> 36:20.960]  gonna have to stand before god someday for what you're doing and i really appreciated that because
[36:22.560 --> 36:26.880]  he was you're saying this is a big deal what you're saying this is a big deal what you're doing
[36:29.680 --> 36:34.000]  and they were on the border just saying you might be right after i went through all this evidence
[36:34.000 --> 36:43.120]  and i said i can stand before god i'm standing before god right now and so are you
[36:43.760 --> 36:49.440]  we're always standing before god god's always right there right and wrong's always right there
[36:50.800 --> 36:55.280]  and i know why people don't want to believe 9-11 was an inside job that's scary
[36:57.280 --> 37:00.960]  you admit that you'd met a lot of things but look at everything else that's happened now
[37:00.960 --> 37:09.920]  now it's not the government ladies and gentlemen it is criminal groups worldwide who share the
[37:09.920 --> 37:20.160]  same spirit of evil the mystery of evil that's the bible calls it how they work together to carry
[37:20.160 --> 37:36.640]  out acts of fraud and deceit and it is the takeover of our society it is the pulling down of all
[37:36.640 --> 37:57.680]  that's good because to the to the wicked ones they think pulling down everything that's good
[37:58.320 --> 38:06.000]  is a victory is power to them that once they've pulled it all down that they will be on top and
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.720]  that and that the light of truth and the light of liberty and the light of justice will no
[38:10.720 --> 38:18.240]  longer be there to burn their skin and the truth is all there will be is the total freezing cold
[38:20.400 --> 38:21.920]  of the night circle of hell
[38:26.320 --> 38:29.520]  devoid of anything good
[38:29.520 --> 38:40.320]  and that's a heavy thing to really face and to know our enemies are like moths to flame
[38:41.200 --> 38:44.720]  they are committed they are worshipers
[38:47.200 --> 38:53.360]  of that destruction they are creatures of fundamental failure
[38:53.360 --> 39:01.200]  and it is so sad
[39:04.400 --> 39:10.240]  and then i look at the good people i look at the children and the innocence and all the simple
[39:10.240 --> 39:16.960]  folks who aren't even so much dumb as they are blind to the real forms of corruption
[39:16.960 --> 39:27.360]  and the real forms of wickedness and i watch them in slow motion being torn to pieces by the system
[39:28.240 --> 39:37.040]  and i watch myself aware of it all but born into it immersed in it not even able to save myself
[39:37.760 --> 39:45.040]  from the contamination physically spiritually mentally and not even able to protect my children
[39:45.040 --> 39:54.960]  and not even able to free the people as we begin to circle faster and faster around the event horizon
[39:54.960 --> 40:05.680]  vortex and come right into line with the point of no return in the event horizon as we cross through
[40:05.680 --> 40:14.080]  and prepare to go into hell on earth
[40:15.440 --> 40:19.920]  and you stare into that place from which no light escapes
[40:21.920 --> 40:25.200]  and and and you see the wreckage of history
[40:27.520 --> 40:28.240]  you see the
[40:28.240 --> 40:37.760]  bones of the civilizations and and just the horror frozen and burned into their faces
[40:38.880 --> 40:45.760]  just just just just the the knowing and and just the in life experience and spiritual experience
[40:45.760 --> 41:01.440]  and just the the edge of knowing is horrific i hope all of you that serve the dark power
[41:04.160 --> 41:10.400]  are satisfied with yourselves because everything you want
[41:10.400 --> 41:19.200]  if as a culture as a world we don't begin to make the decision to turn away from this
[41:19.200 --> 41:25.920]  and it's the decision everything else follows after that you are going to beg later
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.840]  and throw your gold out in the street
[41:29.840 --> 41:38.160]  and plead for god to strike you dead
[41:42.320 --> 41:46.800]  but death will be no escape for you and deep down you know that
[41:49.280 --> 41:55.360]  that's why you're so upset and why you want to take as many people as you can
[41:55.360 --> 42:00.400]  into that place with you
[42:03.120 --> 42:06.400]  now as i said what really hit me this morning
[42:08.480 --> 42:14.000]  is they're committed in a collapse plan of western civilization they've already collapsed
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.680]  the third world stopped it from developing only allowed a slave development system to
[42:19.680 --> 42:28.800]  dehumanize them and actually bloom population so that it's more of a destructive site
[42:32.400 --> 42:34.320]  while claiming you're trying to save the earth
[42:38.240 --> 42:44.320]  but when you see obama and his cohorts moving on every front launching every operation
[42:44.320 --> 42:51.520]  they are trying to overwhelm us right now and demoralize us and break us with the tsa and the
[42:51.520 --> 42:57.760]  and the proctology exams on the highway and all of it and the legalizing by fee out of the illegals
[42:57.760 --> 43:02.480]  and and and and all the criminals lie to do whatever they want the innocent people thrown in prison
[43:03.360 --> 43:06.560]  to build widgets and displace workers outside of the program
[43:06.560 --> 43:14.400]  when you see them engaging in this level of a full-on
[43:16.560 --> 43:17.440]  total assault
[43:17.440 --> 43:33.040]  you know it means something 10 times worse is coming
[43:36.560 --> 43:37.440]  it's very very sad
[43:37.440 --> 43:46.960]  and i cringe
[43:49.360 --> 43:52.880]  and now i keep pausing folks it's just really hard it's really hard
[43:54.320 --> 43:57.760]  it's really hard for myself i know why you're in denial a lot of you because
[43:58.320 --> 44:05.040]  because i'm in denial i mean i know this stuff at a deep level and i know it's real but i still
[44:05.040 --> 44:14.000]  feel just him constantly now mourning and just weeping and just realizing what they're doing
[44:14.000 --> 44:21.120]  to humanity and all the innocence they're hurting right now and then i tears come to my eyes and
[44:21.120 --> 44:27.680]  then i feel sad for trolls on youtube later when they say oh look a tear dropped out of his eye
[44:27.680 --> 44:34.720]  i wonder how he does that you know he's so fake and i understand that they're they're
[44:34.720 --> 44:39.920]  they're weak they're sad they've never had any success in their life so to see someone being real
[44:41.360 --> 44:47.920]  is so alien to them that that they can't admit that someone's real and it's just it's just sad
[44:52.400 --> 44:58.560]  they've lowered the value of humanity so much that people think they get ahead by lowering
[44:58.560 --> 45:05.440]  other people in their eyes when then other people simply lower your value in their eyes
[45:06.000 --> 45:13.680]  and then the value of humanity goes to zero and then it goes negative when you bring in more cheap
[45:13.680 --> 45:22.240]  labor when it's a collapsed society with slave labor you're competing with that is at free market
[45:22.240 --> 45:29.760]  that's suicide economics and it's designed to drag everyone down not use the west to actually build
[45:29.760 --> 45:37.680]  up the third world there are economic programs with with mass manufacturing with systems where
[45:37.680 --> 45:44.160]  the earth could be an eden and the globalists always say they support those systems but actually
[45:44.160 --> 45:49.360]  bring out counterfeit systems to block those developments that's what's so evil and and and
[45:49.360 --> 45:57.040]  just just anti progress about the so-called progressives their name is a fraud the patriot act is the
[45:57.040 --> 46:04.400]  opposite of the patriot the affordable care act is the opposite of affordable care the progressive
[46:04.400 --> 46:13.760]  is a regressive the mainline conservative is not a conservative they are authoritarian fascist
[46:13.760 --> 46:23.440]  with christian camouflage and we need to just see things for what they are not as we would like
[46:23.440 --> 46:31.680]  them to be and i see myself for what i am most people couldn't handle this level of stress most
[46:31.680 --> 46:38.000]  people could not uh handle this amount of power it's embarrassing to even say that it's a fact
[46:38.000 --> 46:47.360]  most people um would become extremely decadent and disconnected and narcissistic and i've actually
[46:47.360 --> 46:52.240]  become less narcissistic over the years you're supposed to as you get older anyways but at the
[46:52.240 --> 46:58.160]  same time i've had a fundamental failure in that as niches said do not stare too long at the abyss
[46:58.160 --> 47:07.200]  unless you become the abyss i i am like super evil now so and i was never like this as a child or
[47:07.200 --> 47:13.760]  even as a young adult i have i'm not evil i'm very good but i know so much about evil now
[47:13.760 --> 47:20.880]  you can't get this level of evil out of yourself i mean you know this stuff and you are now
[47:22.880 --> 47:27.200]  associated with the enemy just like i went and saw ender's game i never read the book
[47:28.800 --> 47:34.800]  i got drug out to it since went and bought up the other day read it one night and written
[47:34.800 --> 47:41.440]  in 1977 as a short story and then expanded in 1984 very deep because to know something
[47:41.440 --> 47:48.720]  enough to defeat it you have to then love it because you then become it and i don't love
[47:48.720 --> 47:54.160]  all the evil and the bad but i know their knowledge of loving it so i know their love
[47:55.200 --> 48:01.200]  if you understand what i'm saying and it's just like i see the mass failure in it i see how it
[48:01.200 --> 48:08.960]  destroys everything but i see that the establishment is not going to pull back folks
[48:08.960 --> 48:16.320]  we're going to have to stop them and the big cop out is it's the end of the world it's the rise
[48:16.320 --> 48:20.400]  of the antichrist and all this other stuff which which obviously the bible is being proven right
[48:20.400 --> 48:25.440]  right now everything is happening but the real bible not what these glitter bugs state run
[48:25.440 --> 48:31.600]  mega churches are teaching you a lot of truth with a bunch of deception because they themselves
[48:31.600 --> 48:36.720]  are deceived how could you analyze something this big i'm not blaming them they were born into this
[48:41.440 --> 48:45.360]  but if you really look at what's there and you really understand what's there
[48:45.360 --> 48:53.120]  a technocracy rises destroys the family destroys the culture poisons the people poisons the ocean
[48:53.120 --> 49:00.560]  kills over a third of the world population absolutely tries to destroy the planet then the
[49:00.560 --> 49:09.520]  devil is bound the world beast system is defeated then the dead in christ rise it's all written
[49:09.520 --> 49:14.080]  there completely clearly a five-year-old can understand that but they're telling everyone
[49:14.720 --> 49:20.960]  that oh no um you don't have to face any of this even though christians throughout history always
[49:20.960 --> 49:25.600]  had to face oppression and evil and be thrown to the lions now they say don't don't pray to the
[49:25.600 --> 49:29.600]  idols don't be thrown to the lions that's on all the tv shows the christian shows you know those
[49:29.600 --> 49:34.560]  were bad christians bad people those weren't real christians we're real christians uh you know
[49:34.560 --> 49:39.040]  pastor hagi says jesus wasn't the messiah i can play that clip and people go to his church ago he's
[49:39.040 --> 49:44.080]  not the messiah now i mean even if you don't believe in god or christianity it's just it's
[49:44.080 --> 49:49.120]  they don't even believe what the book says when it clearly says it and they latch onto it because
[49:49.120 --> 49:59.040]  i know why they do because folks they are absolutely scared to death of the reality
[49:59.040 --> 50:05.040]  they're they don't want to face this technocracy they don't want to go through this test they don't
[50:05.040 --> 50:09.760]  want to have the greatest revival in history because we warn people and then it all comes to
[50:09.760 --> 50:17.120]  fruition and then the people wake up they don't want to be witnesses during this period that's
[50:17.120 --> 50:20.160]  why they have all their operas come out and say the end of the world's next week it's next year
[50:20.160 --> 50:23.920]  so they can make fun of christians and discredit them i mean it's all very sophisticated and even
[50:23.920 --> 50:28.000]  if you don't believe in all this the point is the globalist are luciferians they believe they're
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.480]  going to become god they believe they're going to rewrite the whole planet and become co-creators
[50:33.040 --> 50:37.440]  they believe all this and it matches with the bible from the devil's perspective
[50:37.440 --> 50:46.960]  so regardless if it's real or not in the book it's real in what's being followed
[50:46.960 --> 50:52.720]  you could if you're an atheist i guess you could call it uh self-fulfilling prophecy
[50:52.720 --> 50:56.560]  but a feels will say oh none of that's gonna even happen that's a book yeah but it's coming
[50:56.560 --> 51:03.120]  true then is it just a book my friends alex jones here to tell you about some of the most

[54:04.480 --> 54:10.960]  i'd like to hear from obama supporters now you've celebrated a few months ago and obama care
[54:10.960 --> 54:15.840]  was about to go into place and you told me that you were going to get your free health care
[54:15.840 --> 54:20.160]  you're going to get a special you could have always gotten medicare medicaid now that system
[54:20.160 --> 54:24.400]  is going to implode uh do you want to call in and admit i was right i mean we were reading
[54:24.400 --> 54:29.760]  legislation it's not like we're rocket scientists be like if you took a gun out and said don't shoot
[54:29.760 --> 54:32.640]  yourself in the head with this you shoot yourself in the head with it i mean we know what a gun
[54:32.640 --> 54:39.440]  does we know what a economic bomb does we know what clowered and pivot is we have their battle
[54:39.440 --> 54:49.040]  plans that's why i get angry but again gerbils the nazi propagandist was like lecturing the nazis
[54:50.640 --> 54:57.520]  famously in like 1944 so when they were starting to lose on the eastern front
[54:58.160 --> 55:07.200]  when barba rosa had failed operation barba rosa and he said look to the propaganda stop
[55:07.200 --> 55:14.000]  denying that the russians are gaining on us stop denying that that uh we're uh doing all this and
[55:14.000 --> 55:19.680]  stop denying that the party has been robbing you know good citizens meaning arians and stop all this
[55:19.680 --> 55:23.680]  but we've got to reform this and admit we've been lying the lies only work when you have their
[55:23.680 --> 55:28.640]  confidence we don't have it anymore now we've got to say we're gonna face total annihilation if you
[55:28.640 --> 55:44.880]  don't completely fight so it's the same thing they've now reached the point where their lies
[55:44.880 --> 55:48.560]  aren't working anymore because it's so obvious and they always do they get to that plan that's what
[55:48.560 --> 55:54.080]  homeland security's for is to stop us ever taking the government back but homeland security has to
[55:54.080 --> 55:58.240]  get out of their fantasy land that they're heroes and these great guys and they take the west point
[55:58.240 --> 56:04.320]  cadets to the you know to see the new liberty tower and learn about terrorism when those cadets
[56:04.320 --> 56:10.000]  will end up going and arming and running al-qaeda i mean it's such a sick joke the british governments
[56:10.000 --> 56:18.240]  in the news going we've got to we've got to come out and we've got to uh you know admit now that
[56:18.240 --> 56:24.560]  al-qaeda lapped up all this intelligence and is going to be able to hit us now i mean give me a break
[56:24.560 --> 56:31.840]  al-qaeda that is your excuse to rape every one of their liberties and steal economic data to fix
[56:31.840 --> 56:41.040]  the markets and that's a fact and the pentagon knows they've reached this point whether they're
[56:41.040 --> 56:48.400]  good or bad at the top it's a mix there's got to be some history of honor in the military because
[56:48.400 --> 56:53.920]  it won't work if there isn't honor folks the nazis even though they were misguided and very evil
[56:53.920 --> 56:58.720]  believe they were doing something good that's how they could fight so hard so long and that's why
[56:58.720 --> 57:03.840]  the military now realizes they're gutting the country permanently and they've lost the confidence
[57:03.840 --> 57:08.080]  of the people and that's why the pentagon came out two months ago and said we've been lying
[57:08.080 --> 57:12.800]  we're going to stop lying please believe us and it doesn't even mean they're going to stop lying
[57:12.800 --> 57:17.360]  they can't stop lying it just means they're not going to lie about stuff that they can get 100
[57:17.360 --> 57:23.760]  percent caught in but msnbc hasn't gotten the memo because they're a bunch of lazy slat-jawed
[57:24.560 --> 57:32.960]  fascist posing as communist uh political mercenaries so they're still lying for obama about
[57:32.960 --> 57:38.560]  healthcare being a great success even though obama came out with a half-hearted fake apology
[57:38.560 --> 57:43.760]  so
[57:49.520 --> 57:54.640]  we're going to go to break and come back and uh i will uh i'll play these obama clips and the
[57:54.640 --> 57:59.360]  fake apology and analyze that and the big stuff on israel saying this is very very bad deal with
[57:59.360 --> 58:04.880]  iran that's going on right now uh with the uh peace talks and we'll get into a bunch of economic
[58:04.880 --> 58:08.160]  news and also some good news very interesting not like they're gonna let the general public
[58:08.160 --> 58:12.320]  have access to this fountain of youth gene is discovered and scientists say it could help heal
[58:12.320 --> 58:20.640]  wounds gee think so but you turn off one grip of uh genes what's it do to the others huh
[58:22.880 --> 58:29.440]  and we'll uh get into the proctology exams i mean it really this is what horrifies me is that
[58:29.440 --> 58:34.480]  the police now in the name of the fake drug war which they run the government runs are now gonna
[58:34.480 --> 58:46.000]  rape us on the side of the highway and this is proliferating this is gcn the genesis communications

[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:12.320]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:29.040]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:40.320]  all right we're into hour number two and obviously we're going to be taking your phone calls and
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:45.200]  getting into obama and they're spinning it basically saying that you know he personally
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:50.400]  apologizes for americans losing health coverage now remember and we've got a whole bunch of these
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:57.680]  clips he said it first 29 times on one grouping of videos but then now they found over 50 cases
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:05.440]  um of obama in fact that's an article we ought to do because i've seen it now up to 59 or 60 or so
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:12.480]  uh it's over 50 that he's done it so it's more than 29 that's probably newsworthy that uh it's
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:18.400]  it's it's it's 50 plus probably more than that i mean i was trying to count them all up just yesterday
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:26.000]  but the good news is is that finally people are really starting to wake up the establishment had
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.840]  had known this was coming for a while but it's just disenchanting people across the board
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:38.640]  in the system and the power structure has been on the news asking obama as if he's actually running
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:44.320]  things well how are we going to sell stuff in the future if this is such an incredible screw job
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:50.080]  she because they're all getting doubled and tripled premiums and even though these some of
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.000]  these reporters are making five million dollars a year million dollars a year hundreds of thousands

[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.480]  control us and track us but it's actually creating human intelligence again where we
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:24.720]  share with each other and like that is a good place to fish you know you walk up to a lake and
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.200]  you say hey what are you fishing with a sea catching fish they say oh i'm using purple worms with a

[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:42.800]  ladies and gentlemen we're going to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour i would love to get
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:51.840]  your take on obama coming out and saying that he apologizes for it not working as well and we've
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:57.280]  all got to work together now and they waited till the point when the public basically turned on them
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:05.200]  to do this they tried the old this just doesn't exist it's working wonderfully this is the best
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:13.600]  thing since sliced bread and because that has now failed they are going to just put us into the process
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:18.400]  but look they had to do this it never gave anybody free health care it restricted the quality of the
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:22.720]  care it led big insurance companies owned by foreign banks shut down their competition
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:28.240]  shut down regional clinics shut down small hospitals and it's all in the news now that the
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.680]  big hospitals who had a hand in this basically owned themselves by the big banks of insurance
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:41.440]  companies are exempt from all this and then you're going to have to run to them and pay whatever
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:45.840]  they demand and then they're going to operate outside the rules regulators are going to leave
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:51.440]  them alone and it's going to extinct all their competition then they'll say oh that was such
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:56.880]  a disaster and the socialists will say hurrah let's fully nationalize it but it'll be nationalized
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:03.200]  with the cost being put on the public and the profits going to the globalist who always have
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.920]  craved having all our medical records and deciding what type of medical care we're going to get all
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:14.320]  the medical doctors i've talked to all the health care program managers software developers all of
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:22.320]  them that they say this is this is this is the most vicious inventive multi-layered
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:29.280]  gigantor fraud the galaxy has ever seen what did bonjino the famous secret service agent
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.680]  the top secret service agent on obama's foreign trips what did he explain in that video that
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:39.360]  drudge linked to yesterday or two days ago that was so viral where he said it's worse than you
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:47.840]  know it's worse than you think he said they put out all these scandals on purpose to overload you
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:53.680]  and break you to where you don't know how to differentiate anymore this is and he didn't go
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:59.440]  forward and say it but he said he has criminology that's a criminal tactic folks that is just break
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:08.080]  an area into corruption where the society just accepts it and then the next thing is well the
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.680]  cops might as well manage it and get a little money on the side because it's better than letting
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:16.560]  other criminals come in and manage it you know we'll be guardians of it i mean i mean that's how
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:22.240]  this that's how this corruption works and people like bonjino they know that and they're on the
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:27.520]  inside watching obama plan the destruction of america for the his foreign controllers i mean
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:38.320]  it's a big deal and you know he said i can't work with this guy i can't be in this ship i'm getting
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:45.520]  off this ship a couple years ago because it didn't cool to walk around on red carpets folks
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:50.400]  and to be on air force one i will assure you it's creepy you're around a bunch of evil soulless
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:54.560]  people i tell you i have been around a lot of hollywood folks some of them are neat people
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:01.120]  individually but the general culture is so empty and so horrible and so fake i couldn't want to get
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:09.840]  away from it faster the funnest thing in the world is to play dominoes with old men in a hunting shack
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:16.640]  and to tell jokes around real people and uh and to go out and help build tents with folks and pull
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:22.480]  people out of the mud and and just be be real and and that's what they don't like is just being
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:28.880]  normal folks that straight shooters work together build a country we're the enemy folks because
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:33.760]  they know we're we're not going to just bend over absolutely with what they're bringing in
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:39.040]  they've got stuff planned so horrible that there's no coming back from it ladies and gentlemen
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:45.920]  we've got to realize that this is a plan this is not a screw up they don't care if obama gets
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:52.000]  the blame and goes on off you know into the sunset because they can create more racial
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.240]  division on that they can bring in a new puppet uh or you know the next gimmick will be a woman
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:04.160]  president and just continue the divide and conquer and then yeah it was a disaster yeah
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:09.760]  he was like jimmy carter yeah he was a failure that isn't good enough he's got to be impeached
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:17.520]  he's got to go to jail it's got to go way past that we have to scare these real master criminals
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:26.000]  again they have to be concerned they have to be looking over their shoulder they have to know
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.680]  we're coming after them politically i mean if you just say oh do whatever you want unlimited
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:37.360]  they will steal everything they will blow the engine out on purpose just so they can cut us
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:43.040]  up for scrap politically and then run off to switzerland luxembourg i mean that's the plan
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:48.960]  that they've always hated americans they've always hated our guns they hate the the ghost of the
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:56.320]  republic the ghost of men the ghost of masculinity the ghost of ruggedness and rugged individualism
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:03.680]  the ghost of honor they're afraid of the ghost of the republic they know it can be
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:09.840]  reanimated they know it can rise again they know as things get more and more horrible and as it gets
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:16.000]  darker and colder and as things get more more disgusting and more more more vile and more
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:23.440]  decadent that all of these ancient truths of liberty are going to shine like torches on a hilltop
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:32.000]  in the deepest of the night and so they want to extinguish those torches before full night falls
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:39.440]  right now we're in the twilight of the republic you can already see the torches of liberty burn
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:44.800]  so bright now as the sun sets that's why this show just gets bigger and bigger and more powerful by
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.800]  the minute which is a great danger and a great responsibility i'm not even saying that with
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:57.120]  pleasure the fact that we are accelerating just at a total viral level of credibility you name it
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:02.560]  on every front is not a testament to alex jones or my crew even though we're hard working folks
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:07.040]  that love liberty and i'm proud of the work we've done and we're getting better it is a testament
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:14.160]  to nightfall ladies and gentlemen it is a testament of the enemy's vanguard already overrunning most
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:20.720]  of our civilization and people see the prosperity draining away like oxygen out of a space capsule
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:28.720]  if you open the portal we're dying right now the republic has its throat slit with blood
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:34.240]  spraying out folks we're going into shock i mean this is it and so of course people are freaked out
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:39.600]  of course people are starting to wake up that isn't enough because the false flags are going to be
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:43.920]  staged there's no way they're going to even have any chance of getting out of what they've done
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:52.160]  unless they stage false flags the political seismic shift of liberty awakening they can't
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:58.800]  bring down nightfall without putting chains on us because people are going to go to the light
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:05.280]  people are going to go to that that that that you know that cottage that has the light in the
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:12.720]  window with the sweet smell of stew cooking over a fire then in the new order is not going to let
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:19.520]  that little that little cottage stand spiritually politically physically it's going to hunt down
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:25.760]  everything good and remove it because do you understand that it must extinguish us
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:35.440]  the destination is poverty the destination is slavery the destination is
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:46.240]  dishonor the destination they're taking us is a horrible place and they're doing it on purpose
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:56.240]  because it's the only way they can control society it's the only way
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:07.280]  uh let's start going to some of these clips here's obama
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:12.640]  forced to fall on the sword it's not enough for civilians to do it and that's fine with the
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:17.280]  establishment but notice it's the insurance company saying you don't change this you don't back off
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:22.240]  republicans you see headlines like republican leadership says they probably can't get rid of it
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:29.360]  and let's have another hit piece on Rand Paul or Ted Cruz who dared to try to not gut the country
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:36.400]  that's why the media has to have this bizarro thing where they boy Ted Cruz is discredited
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:42.800]  yeah he's he's having to go out and give speeches he's in trouble with his constituents
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:49.600]  over obama care he was against it he was the one he said it was a bad deal he said i mean that
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:55.280]  that's what msnbc does every day in cnn when when people like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul's we
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:02.320]  should be on you know we should have them carrying them on our shoulders not that they're perfect
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:09.280]  folks but they're the best we've got and they told the truth so their champions are leaders in our
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:17.280]  credibility to then put a wedge into the enemy's armor crank it open and gut the new world order
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:24.080]  so it's a major chink whenever they come in and attack somebody and really try to destroy them
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:35.280]  like they're doing alex jones matt drudge Ted Cruz the Paul's and many others when they come in
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:40.720]  and attack us militarily in the info war with their propaganda why are they attacking us
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:46.800]  why does rachel madhouse say don't go with his talking points republicans tea party don't do it
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:51.440]  it discredits you whatever you do and they're actually desperate and they think you're so dumb
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:57.760]  a smart person would go oh my gosh there you know they're they're saying that because this is effective
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:02.640]  truth they're scared of this information instead the average republican leadership
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:08.240]  because it's controlled opposition says yeah don't go on that guy's show or don't link to him or don't
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:17.680]  promote him because man he's really whacked out that guy is scary that guy is spooky that guy is
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:24.240]  creepy no i'm not scary or creepy i see exactly what's going on an idiot could see what's going
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:28.480]  on if they were truthful with themselves and i'm here like the five-year-old the three-year-old
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:32.160]  the emperor's walking butt naked down the street no one wants to admit he's naked because they don't
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.800]  want to get in trouble and a little kid laughs says he's naked that's all i've done and everybody's
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:42.400]  standing there going that guy's really scary no what's scary is the emperor is butt naked walking
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:46.560]  on the middle street that's what's scary i'm gonna play these clips and we're gonna go to your phone

[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:06.720]  or if you've actually had your premiums lowered everyone i know has had them at least double
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:13.280]  the the yearly premium and of course they won't even say that a lot of the forms it'll just it'll
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:17.200]  just show you know it doubled for that month but you've got to also look at it or they're
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:21.600]  staggering and out of the year it gets more and more until it more than doubles some plans like
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:33.040]  humana and others 539 increase that was a natural news story with the article and and with the letter
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:38.240]  and and you see countless others we published one with a woman with in austin 200 and something
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:43.520]  increase so i'd like to hear from you and and of course in the argument is well that'll pay
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:47.760]  for my free health care you could already get medicare and medicaid the hospitals would criminally
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:53.920]  lie to you and not render aid to you if they did that and under the socialist model that's where
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:58.720]  you statistically you can look it up have much higher levels of aid not being rendered and you're
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:04.640]  going to find all this out now because that's in the bill as well and i mean it was written by
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:09.200]  insurance companies in big hospitals what do you think is going to happen so here's obama saying
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:16.000]  that uh he kind of halfway apologizes here it is i am sorry that they uh you know are finding
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.280]  themselves in this situation based on assurances they got for me we've got to work hard to make
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:28.240]  sure that uh they know uh we hear them and that we're going to do everything we can uh to deal
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:32.560]  with folks who find themselves uh in a tough position as a consequence of this oh they'll deal
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:36.080]  with either iran riot police everywhere and arm into the teeth against us
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:44.960]  and and he's an arrogant narcissist i enjoy saying when i'm wrong because i want to get it out in
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.600]  the open and try to be better these people hate saying they're wrong they're a bunch of arrogant
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:54.560]  scums that they're going to live forever uh let's go ahead and go to another one here here's chuck
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:28:02.880]  Todd uh grills obozo here it is do you feel like considering how much this quote has been it's
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:08.800]  late night it's all sorts of things that do you understand if people are going to be skeptical
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:14.960]  of the next promise you make of the next uh or are you concerned that people are going to be wondering
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:19.440]  geez what's the fine print that he's not telling me do you get that people might be a little more
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:24.240]  skeptical forget the partisans here in washington just average americans you know i'll tell you
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:31.280]  chuck i think that i've not been in national public life for seven eight years uh i've been president
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:40.240]  for uh almost five and i think for the most part people know that i speak my mind and i
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:46.560]  tell folks what i think and i've been very clear about what i'm trying to do all right so oh i
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:52.560]  tried to not do this to you but i did and meanwhile if you're if you're ready a listener there's a
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:58.000]  painting a famous painting of george washington between them and and and he always has that look
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:04.480]  of like you know he's embarrassed he's even posing for the painting and at that time in his life had
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:10.080]  just excruciating toothache so it's like george washington angrily looking down but trying to not
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:19.120]  look angry basically there's george washington the epitome of honor the epitome of manhood the
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:27.280]  epitome of will the epitome of goodness with these this this media rat who's only attacking his

[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:39.440]  obama sitting there knowing he's got to be publicly uh flogged uh as the sacrificial
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:45.360]  political goat to keep the banks and insurance companies out of hot water that's who did this

[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:15.360]  care banker care you know it's good to call it obama care because you put it on the democratic
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:21.440]  party but that's not enough it needs to be establishment care or scam care or fraud care
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:30.080]  foreign bank care or foreign tax care i mean it's mainly foreign multinational offshore banks
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:33.680]  that did this that's i'm just trying to think about how do we actually get out of this
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:39.520]  the republican leadership is not going to get rid of all of it they'll end up watering it down
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:46.240]  and it'll be even worse because these special interests again think it's a virtue to bankrupt
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:56.480]  everybody amazing so 800 25 at 99231 800 25 at 99231 a couple days ago we released this video
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:01.120]  i'm gonna have it reposted up on info wars dot com that kit daniels already did a story this morning
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:07.600]  on that some of the news up on info wars dot com new robo cop movie envisions world patrolled
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:14.880]  by drones fed subjecting innocent women uh to finger probe of both orifices this is just too
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:20.800]  insane this is intensifying activists launch online film festival to counter tsa and nsa
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:24.880]  attacks on free speech that's what i'm about to play and then go to your calls obama i am sorry
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:29.440]  americans will lose their existing health care plan because of obama care that videos up on the
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:35.120]  site major hospitals all across the country not included under new insurance plans uh next generation
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:40.640]  of flash mobs the breakdown of law and order world's first 3d printed metal gun we're going to talk
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:47.360]  about that and uh paul greg roberts has the article how america was lost and you know it's funny i
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:54.960]  think the december issue uh is going to be uh as we asked last december will 2013 be the year america
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:36:02.080]  dies and i really think you can stick a fork in it and say that we're done but we're not like a person
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:07.120]  when they're dead they're dead we could come back so i i i think the cover will probably be something
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:10.640]  like i'm not sure it might be on fukushima that may be even more important a big investigative
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:18.560]  report we're doing but 2013 the year america died and was reborn because people really are in every
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:23.200]  poll really starting to go wait a minute it's not just mismanagement they want to bankrupt us to
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:30.480]  make us dependent more people are getting that now uh and so it's pretty scary folks how they take
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:35.440]  the one of the greatest work ethics the world's ever known and the healthiest and the smartest and
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:40.880]  the highest IQ the most mean in a fight and the historians all the world marveled about americans
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:47.760]  the most inventive the most vicious the most evil the the the best we were all the extremes
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:51.520]  now we're just a bunch of self-propelled stomachs because they put chemical weapons in the water
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:57.120]  and the food folks i mean it's real simple and weaponized cultures we're going to play this clip
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:02.880]  and then go back to your calls uh you know the false flag may be a strike on iran and
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:09.360]  you know netanyahu saying it's a very very bad deal i don't trust the mulas uh and then and
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:12.640]  they say they want to blow up israel but israel says they want to blow up the mulas i mean it's
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:18.720]  just a bunch of sectarian tribal warfare garbage and i'm sick of it i don't have a dog in the israeli
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:23.600]  fight i don't have a dog in the iranian fight and i'm telling you this is all larger you got
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:28.560]  fleets massing off china i got a big stack of news about gear up for war with china just like
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:32.880]  jill scousin says i'm gonna get jill scousin on next week guys even sunday if you can do it
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:36.720]  i know we got a guest in studio sunday the point is i said i'd go to your calls
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:42.560]  i was real tired today and um i have real bad allergies today they've been a lot better because
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:47.840]  i drink more water in the uh proprietary nasa night on has been helping but it's just everybody i know
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:52.240]  my family's got bad allergies right now and i see the guzzle more water so i thought i'll just come
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:57.760]  and take a bunch of calls but sometimes i'm more prolifically profound i think would be the arrogant
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:04.160]  way of putting it when i actually feel under the weather is that i'm not just so hyper with so much
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:10.480]  energy i'm like running around like the taz manian devil bouncing into things uh but uh i want to
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:17.040]  play this clip and then come right back to you uh here is this announcement of a real resistance
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:22.560]  movement in the info war they want to ban talking about about the nsa and the tsa for a reason
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:28.000]  because it's effective here's that report we're going right to obama care uh supporters after that
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:36.720]  america is going under classical hardcore tyranny censorship and persecution of the
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:44.240]  press and whistleblowers is yet an all-time high our nation is beginning to mirror the
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:52.240]  corruption and oppression and persecution that the soviet union ladled out against the press
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:59.840]  and activist it's beginning to race towards the type of suppression we witnessed under hitler
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:07.200]  mal and others and it's time for the american people to not cower in fear of this it's time
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:13.920]  for the american people to get angry to get focused and to get aggressive we see people that
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:19.280]  post on facebook that their premiums have gone up under obama care having their facebook accounts
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:26.800]  deleted or suspended the same thing on twitter we're seeing artists who parody the tsa or the nsa
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:33.600]  being threatened with arrest being sued being fined having their websites taken down with
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:42.080]  speech that's clearly protected my friends across the board there is a darkness of intimidation
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:47.520]  and chilling effect settling in to the united states but also in europe and that's why here
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:54.720]  at info wars we're striking back with another film contest we've had more than 15 of these
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:40:01.280]  contests they have reached tens of millions of people this contest is going to be for 10 thousand
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:10.160]  dollars and you'll have until january 7th to get your videos produced and uploaded to youtube and
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:17.360]  two other video platforms we will then post the entries on info wars dot com and prison planet dot
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:24.000]  com and this contest is to defend the first amendment and let these tyrants know that any
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.800]  further attempts to restrict our free speech will only be met with a doubling down of resistance
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:36.400]  here's the contest you can go to info wars dot com where we have this video and the rules posted
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:40.640]  and examples of previous contests that we've had so that it can give you an idea of what the
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:46.640]  winning entries will be we're going to have one prize for ten thousand dollars you can do parodies
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:54.480]  of the tsa or the nsa because the tsa has threatened to arrest anyone making jokes at the airport
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:41:00.560]  something that's clearly unconstitutional and it's just a threat you are also reminded that
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:07.360]  any inappropriate remarks or jokes concerning security may result in your arrest we appreciate
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:14.720]  your cooperation while these measures are in effect the nsa has gone after people making fun of them
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:19.920]  as we just mentioned earlier so it's important to also lampoon them and let them know that free
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:26.640]  speech is alive and well but the winning entry might be a investigative report on the tsa or
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:33.360]  the nsa or you could do a report on both of them i will watch the videos with my team and pick the
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:41.440]  ten thousand dollar winner one winner ten thousand dollars to be announced in january of 2014 so get
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:46.320]  going you've got a little over a month and a half to get your videos produced and to get them out
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:52.400]  there and regardless we all win by promoting the first amendment by promoting free expression
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:57.360]  and by standing up to these tyrants that are attacking our free speech think about how far
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:03.680]  we've gone how far we've fallen what are we going to put up with next it's time to get past the fear
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:08.640]  and to have everybody stand up sure they may put us on a list they may put you on a list
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:14.240]  that way we know who the good guys are everybody on the list the bad guys are the people that aren't
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:20.720]  on the list it's time to let these tyrants know we're not scared of them and that we are on the
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:26.720]  offense because the best defense is a strong offense these people are attacking us and it's
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:33.040]  time to strike back and let the tsa and the nsa and all the other alphabet agencies that are
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:40.560]  raping our liberties know we are not their slaves reclaim the constitution repeal the patriotic
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:48.960]  and abolish the nsa be part of history be part of resisting these tyrants let your voice be heard
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:56.080]  produce a video today to support free speech in this country before it's extinguished and finally
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:04.560]  i have a message for those collaborating with these tyrants history is littered with civilizations
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:10.560]  that have gone along with corruption only to fall and implode we do not want to let america
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:19.280]  to disintegrate into abject authoritarian oppression choose the side of liberty admit you've been wrong
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:25.120]  and support the first amendment don't be like admiral yamamoto the head of the japanese fleet
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:31.280]  that attacked pearl harvard who wrote back to the emperor saying i fear we have awakened a sleeping
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:39.120]  giant to terrible resolve admit that the road we're going down is one that leads to rack and ruin
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:45.600]  and let's turn this around before america completely collapses into civil war because of the globalists
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:49.680]  think they're going to have some soviet style takeover in america they're gravely mistaken
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:58.720]  so that's the contest and again it's just one more salvo against the globalists in the fight for
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:05.680]  liberty up on drudgereport.com on the left hand side halfway down food bank ceo welfare cuts
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:10.960]  causing nightmare ripple effect and so there's a whole bunch of these different food bank heads
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:15.280]  in new york and new jersey and california and other places saying look we're running out of
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:20.400]  food fast and you know i don't give money to the drug doubt homeless folks you see on the side of
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:25.520]  the street but uh if i'm like at a bus stop or driving by a bus stop and seeing an old lady
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:30.080]  with both her legs chopped off from diabetes and looking completely freaked out and you know
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:35.520]  uh clear out i go over and give them money and also try to give food to the food bank but we get
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:45.520]  so busy we forget i'm making a commitment that i am going to give um a lot of food this holiday
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:50.960]  season directly to the food bank i'm going to go buy organic quality food and do that and i'm going
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:56.480]  to give money to meals on wheels and i'm going to give money to the salvation army and see the
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:02.480]  reason i said before go to the obama callers is that if we were doing our job in charity you
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:06.800]  wouldn't have the government there in the place of but see government comes in to be the charity
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:14.000]  group and then charity ends and then it isn't charity it's social engineering ron paul three
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:21.520]  days a week he worked uh as a medical doctor at a fancy hospital uh down in south texas on the
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:26.880]  coast this is all on record uh but then three days a week doctors work six days a week especially in
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:34.320]  those days he would go work for two dollars a day two dollars a day is what they paid at the charity
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:42.640]  hospital delivering babies by the way he didn't do that because he was some like type of hero
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:50.880]  that's what doctors did that's what men of honor did when you take on a priestly position and you
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:58.160]  go back to every civilization a doctor that is a priestly position as a sacred position not some
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:07.040]  pill dispensary my dad wrote an article about it and i'm not even gonna get into it just yesterday
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:14.800]  but it was just about some family in mind that they uh they went in they it was all computerized
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:21.360]  she said oh i can't do my sugar test she's never had a high blood sugar i um i'll tell the story
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:26.320]  after i go to calls she says i'm gonna say the family member for their privacy but she's old
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:30.560]  old lady it goes to them and they go it doesn't matter so they take her blood
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:36.880]  and they say oh you've got some high blood sugar we're gonna put you right now on this new pill
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:44.400]  and my dad went and looked at the paperwork and everything and and and and my father family
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:49.520]  remember witnessed all this going on and they're supposed to do a test where they take a blood cell
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:55.200]  and then they basically extract the data in it just like a hair follicle has a history in it
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:47:01.600]  has a month at least a month in the red blood cell history of the sugar so you average that together
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:04.320]  and you're really supposed to do that but the computer programs now
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:10.480]  say no no no just put them on this drug because the drug companies now control the programming
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:15.520]  and basically if you're an old person and already skinny this stuff will kill you
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:20.800]  it'll make you lose weight till you die and absolutely wrecks your guts and one pill
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:28.720]  basically almost killed her and the doctor thought it was real funny when my dad who is
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.440]  a oral surgeon and a dentist and also a chemist went and tried to you know basically investigate
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:38.560]  it it's just funny folks very very funny to these people there it is hhs computers take control
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:44.560]  away from doctors nine-year-old woman put on diabetics medication when she didn't have diabetes
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:51.520]  one pill and it says in there expect violent reactions and these people are sick so there's
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:56.960]  your obama care kyle was a former obama care supporter then we go to matt uh you know i'm
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:02.000]  going to call after i want to hear from a supporter uh matt you actually signed up tell
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:08.720]  us about it uh yeah first off i just wanted to say thanks and um well i was one of those
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:15.840]  unfortunate people who got who's a victim of the modern medical complex so i had a uh i had a um
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:24.720]  pre-existing condition and um about the end of last year i realized um my job was going nowhere
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:29.600]  so i decided to go to school full-time and really focused on getting my own businesses up off the
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:37.120]  ground and uh so i've been paying cobra about 500 a month 550 a month really to have a good good
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:43.760]  plan because because of my pre-existing condition and uh starting next year i signed up i mean it
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:52.560]  did take me about six weeks to get to get the first uh application process but it finally
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:58.240]  processed yesterday or a couple days ago and uh i qualified for medicaid because i'm a student
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:01.680]  because i've been a student this year i haven't made much money you would have always been able
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:08.320]  to get medicaid if you were a student and didn't have enough money now that the because i'm a male
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:13.280]  over the age of 21 they don't you don't qualify unless you have a family or you're disabled or
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:21.600]  um or other things like that i'm not saying that the obama care is the whole the whole thing is good
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:26.800]  but i think that the medicaid should have been expanded to begin with i was not a fan of obama
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:30.960]  care to be uh in in general well i was about to say if you're going to have socialism just expand
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:35.840]  medicare and medicaid everybody which they claim is really the socialist plan but that's not what
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:40.720]  this is and that's bad i have to make everybody dependent and it'll give government control the
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:47.280]  inch you i hope folks understand the insurance companies wrote this and uh it's like rat poison
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:54.400]  it's 90% good 10% poison i mean so it's interesting to hear a case where you were able to get this
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:58.320]  when you couldn't get it previously now from the way i've read it and from what i've heard you may
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:05.120]  have been being misled uh if you could show a pre-existing condition that's basically a disability
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:10.400]  and should be listed as so and and then you can go if you've been refused insurance and then charity
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:15.680]  care kicks in you know most hospitals are quote tax exempt but they really are profit driven they're
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:20.720]  supposed to do at least a third of their work as charity did you know until about 15 years ago when
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:25.600]  they got rid of the hypocritic of doctors and medical practitioners were taught that that you
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:32.480]  are to minister to the poor for free and if you need devices or instruments you are to go just like
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:39.120]  in you know all the famous literature fiction as well as non-fiction where you go around knocking
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:43.520]  on people's doors there's doctors saying i need money for the fund for the poor for the medical
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:48.240]  equipment and uh that's just like on a christmas carol they come to you know and we need money for
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:52.720]  the orphanage for the kids that's what you're supposed to do and then it's all decentralized
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:58.240]  and it works a lot better but very very interesting to hear your positive story they'll be right back

[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:54.640]  that i went in i wanted to get a check up i don't need their care i don't have any problems i'm 56
[02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:59.760]  years old but i know what's been going on now and i've been looking at this for the last 10 years
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:05.280]  i talk about these people as being nazis but let me tell you what happened i told them that i said
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:10.560]  well you know i got this stuff called nason iodine well why are you taking that there's no reason
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:17.360]  for you to be taking that i can't get an american doctor every last one of them is a middle eastern
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:24.720]  guy or some dude from india can barely speak english they get outraged when i talk about taking
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:31.040]  vitamins exercising and then i talked about the nascent iodine and they said well you know something
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:36.640]  i don't even think that you should be on medicaid they're going to take it away i said you do what
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:41.200]  you got to do and i'm going to do what i got to do i said but i'm going to your game let me tell
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:46.640]  you something they were ready to strap me to a gurney and haul me off to the big house to cuckoo
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:52.400]  nuts you understand what i'm saying brother i hear you i hear you and then nothing against foreigners
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:57.840]  but in the caste class they bring particular folks over from india this is on record to va mainly
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:03.040]  because over there you know they follow orders and everybody else is subhuman
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:07.520]  in the caste system i mean i'm sorry talk about racism i see the dot in the middle of the forehead
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:12.480]  is like whoa i mean that's like saying everyone else is not even human under me okay and that's
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:17.200]  ignorant people are like folks always say native americans are perfect i'm i've got three different
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:22.480]  groups of native american in my background very proud smart amazing people i'm proud of my native
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:26.960]  american heritage like i've gotten so old i've forgotten all the names of them comanche what was
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:32.080]  the other one i've got my dad i need to ask him about that the point is is that then said because
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:35.280]  he's to actually go to the indian thanks when he was a kid you know i don't mean like when it was
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:38.960]  some show park you know for the church come look at i mean he would actually go to you know the
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:44.880]  native american rituals uh a few times a year with his grandparents and you know his dad didn't go
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:48.720]  to he was too busy the point is that stuff gets phased out but i mean the indians were all killing
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:53.440]  each other constantly they were always trying to get the white guys to raid with them was and
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:57.840]  the french would be with this group it was all different groups angling like a big risk game
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:02.480]  or something humans are humans people they're people and everybody always sets themselves up
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:08.400]  in some cast saying they're better than everybody uh let's talk to kyle um you're on the air from
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:15.200]  pennsylvania what do you think of ovomet care well i had even called your show and tried to
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:20.560]  defend it a couple weeks ago and i said that i thought it was a good first step to reforming
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:27.600]  the health care system but after our conversation i did a little research of my own and followed up
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:34.160]  and now i've come to the conclusion that it is a step but it's a big step in the wrong direction
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:41.840]  and if there is a large amount of eugenics there are death panels there is health care rationing
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:48.240]  um and you know it's going to create that sense of there are people who are entitled to care and
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:54.960]  there are people who are just better off fed and that is completely against the american way um
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:04:01.040]  and you know i can say i'm a big enough man to say that i was completely wrong and it's a big you
[02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:08.960]  know this is a big cf it's a big mess up my problem is is it is it is that is that everybody was
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:12.160]  they've already wrecked the system they make it hard to make it in this country now i don't blame
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:15.920]  folks wanting some free health care they could get it the problem is is that it's meant to get
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:20.160]  control of us and and and then now do you think they're going to get rid of it or you think they'll
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:25.120]  just get everybody to go along with it no it's going to be like anything else that government
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:31.760]  does there'll be a big protest but a big to do about it and then mainstream news and you know
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:38.800]  cnn msnbc they'll put this on the back burner and there'll be some justin beaver or some celebrity
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:43.680]  scandal it'll come to the forefront six months later you'll turn around and it'll just be part
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:49.600]  of life exactly exactly and then they know it's a process and then it'll just be phased in and
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:54.320]  that's it and then the old puppet obama goes out the new puppet comes in that's why we've got to
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:05:01.760]  have a fundamental awakening and just say no and i think we're on the verge of that introducing pro

[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:59.920]  the last two years in fact we've been right at the forefront as worldnetdaily has been and others
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:10.160]  have been getting into the fact that obama is radically as he promised to do transforming
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:15.680]  america in the regulatory positions the military positions in the judgeships everywhere really
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:26.800]  putting hardcore marxist worshipers of lenin malo socialist eugenicist i mean this is scary
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:32.320]  so it doesn't matter when obama leaves we've got a crew of really dangerous people in there
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:37.680]  who fundamentally hate this country on record obama went to reverend rach church 21 years
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:42.320]  was like a kuklux klan meeting house for black folks but say he never really heard the sermons
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:46.400]  this is pure bull and of course he's a frontman for the globalist but the point is they're using
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:52.800]  this radical marxist ideology as the shock troops to take over well the insider we have on right now
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:58.560]  michael maloof he has talked to all these major generals you name it brigadier generals the list
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:04.400]  goes on and on who've confirmed what our navy seal sources have said on record and off record
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:09.280]  what our military police sources have said what fort hood psyopsis told us that we've confirmed
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:15.680]  they give us good intel over and over again these are good men i've met them and there is a total
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:21.760]  purge of the litmus test will you confiscate guns now this is a list of tests on other issues as well
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:29.120]  but we've got mr maloof on with us right now his articles at worldnetdaily.com and we link to him
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:35.680]  on info wars.com here's alan west congress must probe military firings i agree with that
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:41.200]  but say that for months general blames night stalker for military purge and he's got general
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:47.200]  boykin all of them going public congressional medal of honor winners going public major generals
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:52.560]  you name it and so he joins us sir thank you so much please please break down from your high
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:59.360]  level sources as much as you can tell us well thanks for having me thank you number one uh there
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:05.840]  seems to be uh something permeating not only at the high ranks but uh but now it's it's uh coming
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:12.560]  down to the mid levels and even and even mid-level officers and even into the um listed ranks uh
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:20.880]  there's if you disagree with uh the president's uh or the administration's policy uh you you are
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:26.240]  basically uh set aside in your career is basically ended and this seems to be uh catching on more
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:31.680]  and more now there are as as uh congressman west mentioned to me there are some zipper issues that
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:38.800]  have uh occurred even among the higher ranks but uh but the but as general boykin told me this is
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:44.080]  unprecedented to have so many flag officers so many four star generals removed in such a short
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:49.360]  period of time and what we're talking about nine general officers just in one year uh he removed
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:57.360]  some of the previous years now some the some of the other presidents bush and uh uh removed a few
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:03.040]  a few generals because they disagreed with his policy on iraq you know but it wasn't at at the
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:08.080]  scale that we're seeing in the obama administration today in fact sir i've seen defense league
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:13.200]  articles and i've seen your articles it break it down it's it's 200 or more this this has never
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:19.520]  happened no in in in u.s history and it's and it's not like it's a downsizing this is this is political
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:24.320]  persecution can you tell us what the generals have told you the litmus test are well they
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:31.600]  some of the litmus tests uh include if you um uh speak out against uh radical islam uh like
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:37.280]  lieutenant colonel duly uh that this was uh and then general demsey who's our who's the
[02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:42.560]  chairman of the joint chiefs of staff actually ridiculed uh do little for doing that but this
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:47.440]  was an instructor who was talking about radical islam in a classroom in an approved class
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:57.200]  and yet he's out and and so it's and we've had um some other uh uh uh officers and and even
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:02.160]  enlisted personnel saying that they get more training in sexual harassment than they do
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:07.520]  uh in firing their weapons well that was my next point we have ford hood uh leaking two weeks ago
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:11.440]  that fox confirmed it the secretary of the army as you know in public they were saying if you're
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:16.640]  evangelical or give money to the tea party we will court-martial you that is unprecedented and then
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:23.040]  bad-mouthing the founding fathers and army manuals i mean this is absurdist yeah this is uh the
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:29.360]  gen the generals have been quite vocal that if you're not speaking the administration uh uh
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:34.560]  outlook on things that uh you're you're basically going to be uh rewrote it out now they
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:39.280]  generally the generals and the and the and military personnel generally cannot speak out
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:45.440]  against commander-in-chief while they're on active duty or and uh but exactly sir so you're the
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:50.080]  expert on this from when i've read these guys really aren't even bucking things no they just
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:55.040]  know they're patriots so they must be spying on them or have intelligence files on them well as
[02:15:55.040 --> 02:16:03.040]  um i think general valoli told me um they they've actually get have senior officers who are acting
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:10.560]  almost like communist political commissars that's right who are looking out for uh uh anyone who
[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:18.720]  expresses uh opposition or even questions uh a policy determination and and you can't and they
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:25.840]  and the troops believe that their first amendment rights now are being uh uh uh dismissed as a
[02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:30.080]  consequence well yes sir mr milo if you tell somebody you can't give money to evangelicals
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:36.000]  or the tea party that is a trillion times over the top i mean that's that that's like soviet
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:42.320]  level yep well that's why uh general valoli said it was like uh uh communist commissars
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:48.160]  uh this is the way things are going they're uh the the enlisted men and the and even the
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:53.920]  mid-level officers are trying to watch their six constantly now because they don't know if if they
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:58.000]  say something that's out of line they don't know if this is the end of their career oftentimes
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:03.520]  are not told anything nothing it's just that they just don't get promoted and they get set aside and
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:08.800]  if you don't get promoted after a certain period of time you're out now you talk about the big issue
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:15.200]  here the morale they've got to know uh persecuting christians saying you can't even give money the
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:19.280]  tea party violate their first amendment i mean they've got to know that's going to kill morale
[02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:25.040]  trying to put women in front line combat yes well there are three elements here that that are
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:30.000]  really sticking in the crawl of a lot of the military personnel that is the one would be
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:39.360]  gays in the in the same foxholes women in the foxholes as well as the rules of engagement
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:47.360]  rules of engagement are really a demoralizing factor and as a consequence a lot of number of
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:54.400]  our troops have actually gotten killed because uh we couldn't respond in a firefight and the constant
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:18:00.560]  and uh or there or there might be there could be the possibility of civilians and so we our troops
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:06.880]  have had to stand down there have been instances of this time and again in uh especially in afghanistan
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:12.080]  and it's actually gotten some of our troops killed but then meanwhile that's when it's a group they
[02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:17.440]  want to protect meanwhile from what i've heard from my sources was really freaking the military out
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:22.800]  is that they're now actually having to go to iraq and jordan and actually train al qaeda and these
[02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:28.160]  guys are on the record on the on foreign news bragging that they literally insult on the basis
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:33.760]  i'm surprised they don't get killed these special warfare people and say i killed you dirty americans
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:38.560]  just five years ago in iraq and when i'm done with the sod i'm going to kill you that has got
[02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:44.080]  special warfare literally literally freaking out because as you know committing suicide
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:48.800]  because they're being told to train al qaeda what can you say about that well the problem is is that
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:54.320]  we're seeing uh increasing numbers of these guys who are who are our friends today but
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:59.440]  they're going to turn on us tomorrow just like we train the mojahedin and uh and actually
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:05.360]  help create the mojahedin against the then soviet union in afghanistan and now it's it's become our
[02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:11.120]  worst enemy and uh well sure i've been asking the questions people we've had guys shot by uh
[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:16.640]  you know uh green on blue uh and then there's been some very recent cases of this
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:21.040]  yes sir you're the expert on this with your sources i mean i mean you've got congressional
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:26.560]  medal of honor winners retired major generals i mean just an incredible list talking to you
[02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:32.000]  and really not anybody else why have they come to you a and then b i've been asking the questions i
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.080]  want to give you the floor the next 10 minutes sir give us a presentation on what you think is most
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:42.160]  important what people need to know and what this is going to do to us force structure with china
[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:47.520]  and the rest of it literally turning into something like a marxist college i mean that's going to
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:55.120]  destroy the military yo the a few of the generals told me i reached out to them uh some of them have
[02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:59.920]  been somewhat uh uh outspoken on this but when you actually confront them and get them to think
[02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:06.480]  about it they see a much larger problem here that that's emerging and it's permeating throughout
[02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:11.680]  the ranks it's just not a few and they're seeing some of these spirals as being politically
[02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:18.240]  motivated for example the three generals that got canned right on the eve of uh right after
[02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:25.040]  bangazi uh the concern is is that they're using they were using the firings to deflect attention
[02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:31.920]  from this ongoing investigation on bangazi which is far from resolved and as a consequence uh there
[02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:38.720]  there seems to be uh the the notion of trying to hide things we've had some cia officers actually
[02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:44.800]  told if you go up and testify you're going to be removed from your jobs so the intimidation is is
[02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:51.600]  somewhat uh happening in the intelligence world but it's also much more uh it and it's easier in
[02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:58.480]  the military world because these guys have to salute take orders and and shut up and and but but uh
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:05.440]  the the the over the overarching picture is that it's having a fundamental problem of
[02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:12.160]  emasculating the troops it uh i've had general balali and even general brady tell me that
[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:20.400]  our readiness is being affected as a consequence of this our our troops our troop structures
[02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:26.800]  being cut back tremendously they're using age old equipment our ships we were down to about
[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:33.600]  a third of the size of what of what our navy was in terms of our capital ships at the time
[02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:41.840]  so there's there's a complete uh emasculation of our military forces across the board and
[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:46.800]  uh this is becoming a very very serious problem in terms of readiness and i think this is what
[02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:56.000]  the is really a concern to the uh to the upper brass well again if you just joined us we have
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:01.840]  a gentleman who advised the pentagon on national security at the highest levels for a long time
[02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:06.160]  in the office of the secretary of defense uh michael maloof he's got his new book out where
[02:22:06.160 --> 02:22:11.040]  we're talking about that some uh briefly here in a minute look here's my issue okay i'm known as
[02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:16.320]  this radical libertarian guy that you know is so out there now i'm not known as that because
[02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:20.960]  it's all coming true i wish i'd been proven wrong i would love to like not work this hard not be in
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:24.800]  this much danger with these people with the threats and the and the socialist harassment
[02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:31.120]  and all of it but i mean it does get to a point where i can't even believe this that that we have
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:37.840]  the the training manual and the threats saying the founding fathers quote wouldn't be accepted
[02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:43.600]  in today's military i mean i can't even believe it's that over the top and then we have them saying
[02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:47.920]  if you are part of the tea party and give them money that's aiding a terrorist and we're going
[02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:53.120]  to use stuff that's used on al-qaeda if you're funding radical islam and and we're going to arrest
[02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:58.320]  you it actually said you may be court marshaled they i mean that is the that is so over the top
[02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:03.440]  and then meanwhile there is radical islam and i'm not some as they call it islamophobe but i know
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:09.520]  there are those major radical elements that that that obama is totally cozying up to let me ask
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:14.560]  you this question from your inside sources and overall full spectrum analysis of this
[02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:21.680]  what is the strategy backing radical islam trying to overthrow the military uh well i'm not a total
[02:23:21.680 --> 02:23:26.640]  fan of but they're better than al-qaeda 10 times better uh in in places like egypt uh getting rid
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:32.560]  of qaddafi putting in al-qaeda trying to get rid of Assad put in the the crazies i mean what what is
[02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:39.440]  the grand strategy i'm here well there seems to be part of part of it i think has to do with
[02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:46.400]  a traditional type of uh a alliance that we had and basically what the Saudis the Saudis have been
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:54.160]  big the biggest biggest exporters of wahhabi sunni wahhabism for years and of course they
[02:23:54.160 --> 02:24:02.080]  for the creation of a lot of the islamist radicals i mean you have uh principandar now who is uh
[02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:10.320]  well you might not agree with the with the government of uh of uh bashar al-asad but in
[02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:16.720]  syria uh he is a major backer and financier of the foreign fighters that are going in there
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:22.320]  he's also and also the chechens uh he told putin that he can turn on and off the switch
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:27.040]  which i think a lot of this has to do with our traditional ties and and the fact that
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:34.560]  that we we uh that the united that that obama now has begun to show a little bit of a a tilt
[02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:40.880]  toward iran that has even incensed uh the Saudis even even more and they're actually
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:51.200]  increasing uh a lot of the um the spread of the islamist radical uh uh fighters uh so you now
[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:57.120]  today see them not only waiting for the united states to leave afghanistan and and and opening up
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:03.600]  which will then allow these radicals to come back into the central asia into the caucuses
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:08.720]  but also into the uh arabian peninsula and then then you swing around and into samalia
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:15.360]  north africa and into the maghreb there there is a pattern of behavior of these of these radical
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:21.040]  islamists and a lot of this uh it's actually beyond our control today and with the decimation of
[02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:28.960]  our own military and the fact that we we uh uh are not uh that that that that the radical islamic
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:32.800]  movements are actually increasing and not diminishing because of all the work we did in
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:37.760]  iraq and afghanistan we really have a real problem on our hands and we should not be
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:43.200]  diminishing the military we should perhaps be restructuring it to somewhat to increase more
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:48.000]  special forces and what have you i agree well sir i was about to say i mean i'm not a military
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:51.920]  man like yourself for a long time inside of the defense department but i've made a study of just
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:56.480]  history it's so interesting i mean i look at where america is right now and if and if i wanted to
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:26:02.480]  destroy america even midterm i would do what obama's doing i've got to admit he's probably now
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:07.440]  ten times worse than i thought it would be i i mean this this this is just at a gut level
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:11.600]  i look at all the different strategies and strategies and gambits that are going on
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:21.280]  and and and clearly i see u.s interest now turning al-qaeda loose in the in the in the red crescent
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:27.440]  around russia threatening china and i'm not a fan of what china is doing i'm an american but i i i
[02:26:27.440 --> 02:26:34.640]  i see almost a setup against america to put us into wars we can't win with infiltration in the
[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:38.560]  military to destroy it and i've always been somebody who's more libertarian like ram paul i
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:44.800]  say cut it but now i get what you're saying is that there's i mean i for the first time ever
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:50.160]  i know the whole cfr elite and stuff for globalist but i mean are they really crazy enough to try to
[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:55.280]  really destroy american credibility and and get rid of us and maybe just sell out to the
[02:26:55.280 --> 02:27:00.240]  communist chinese or something i mean i i i just look at it and everything points towards sell out
[02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:06.080]  america and the globalists have power through america i i've criticized that strategy i don't
[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:10.960]  like being that that corrupt imp but this is really bad yeah well we're we're seeing it now
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:17.600]  as we try to deploy and and do that pivot to uh east asia yes we just don't have the navy to
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:22.560]  deal with that on a full-time basis and try to live up to commitments elsewhere and and when you
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:28.960]  have a diminished uh... uh... a naval naval force it's it's going to make it even much more uh
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:33.280]  difficult and that we're going to have people who just going to leave the military uh... the fact
[02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:38.640]  that they can get back here to a second to the to the uh... uh... in the purge of our own military
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:43.120]  the fact that they're now the uh... easing out the captain than the majors the people who have
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:48.960]  actually been fighting the wars and and then they're now leaving then who do we have who
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:53.680]  has who's had that battlefield experience sabotage as they get on up to the upper to
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:59.440]  upper ranks it's going to be it's going to be very very serious problem as as uh... in the in
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:04.320]  the years to come and and uh... keeping a very strong military and i think that this is what's
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:08.880]  alarming the generals that uh... to a great extent and this is going to have a this is going to have a
[02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:14.080]  uh... a bearing on our four structure in our in our ability to project power in the future
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:18.000]  and and look out for our interest that we have all around the world now these other countries
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:23.680]  that you mentioned russia and and china now it's intriguing that that they they they too have a
[02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:30.800]  wahhabi problem they have a puny radical islamist problem themselves uh... within the caucuses
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:35.760]  and in the north caucuses area the russians are very fearful that these sunnis are going to be
[02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:41.040]  creating havoc on the time of the february two thousand fourteen winter olympics and fochi
[02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:44.800]  and and uh... and this is where bandar came in he actually said
[02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:47.760]  mr potent if you change your policies are toward uh...
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:53.760]  uh... toward toward syria and and uh... iran uh... i can assure you you will not be attacked during
[02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:58.240]  the during the olympics by but i saw that the russian news in bandar didn't deny it
[02:28:58.240 --> 02:29:02.880]  no i mean why is saudi arabia is so arrogant to threaten a nuclear superpower
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:08.800]  yes well they did they did the fact that they did that bandar has this capability this outreach
[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:13.600]  i mean he is running he doesn't want to become uh... king king of uh... saudi arabia when the
[02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:18.880]  when king of dulladies but this is his power base this is his he wants to be able to show
[02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:23.600]  that he is able to project this kind of capability in this power that's why he's basically taken a
[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:28.240]  much more independent line from the outer space and we see that now and he sounds like napoli
[02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:31.600]  and intriguing michael malews our guests do five more minutes with us i want you to be able to
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:36.080]  finish up and talk about your book and i want to ask you about solutions how do we get out of this

[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:27.840]  so
[02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:32.960]  hitler took the guns stalin took the guns mal took the guns that el castro took the guns
[02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:40.320]  you go show this took the guns 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms
[02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:45.360]  the republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns
[02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:55.760]  i am sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of
[02:33:55.760 --> 02:34:07.120]  man the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex john show
[02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:20.240]  the republic will rise again if we rediscover american ideals but if we continue down this
[02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:27.280]  road it is bad and you know as much as i don't like the american empire then i realized that the
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:33.440]  american empire in its death rows is like trying to start world war three while undermining the
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:40.800]  military with all the weird socialist anti-male stuff that goes on there's always been gay people
[02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:45.520]  in the military folks they don't want anybody that's obsessed with sexual stuff running around
[02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:50.880]  stirring up trouble the military fires more people over officers with women under them
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:55.600]  they're really if they're trying to do a mission you don't want guys with all the women under them
[02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:59.760]  i run an operation with women that work here i don't need a bunch of stuff going on here with
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:05.280]  people i go don't fraternize with with people here even though it's tempting and and and and
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:10.480]  now it's like you're gonna be in with men that are like coming after you i mean it's it's crazy
[02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:14.960]  that's why you don't put women in those combat units where people are but but i'm i'm ranting
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:20.240]  and i'll do that after he leaves michael maloof bestselling author is with us former top pentagon
[02:35:20.240 --> 02:35:26.080]  analyst and the office of secretary of defense world net daily senior writer i asked you during
[02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:29.600]  the break the question and i'll say it for the audience right now give me the best answer you
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:33.280]  can get because i've not seen anybody i know some of these generals are public some haven't
[02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:37.440]  been so public you've got quite a list you're interviewing so you're you're in there because
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:43.280]  they trust you my intel from some of these very people but they won't say it on air is that no
[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:48.960]  obama is looking to use dhs as a fifth arm to take over marine corps colonels gone public and
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:54.400]  others have but that's about as high as they've gone public navy seals on record have gone public
[02:35:54.400 --> 02:36:00.400]  to that obama may actually think about staging some crisis or letting al-qaeda attack us and
[02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:04.560]  claiming the tea parties with them even though it makes no sense the state department has been
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:09.840]  putting stuff out like that so is west point and and trying to go after the american people
[02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:16.320]  they're trying to take the guns and and even though they can't succeed in the mission the the the the
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:24.240]  experience the voyage is the destination that they want to start some civil war in america
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:28.960]  and that's what i'm getting from high-level military sources have they said anything on or off
[02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:35.760]  record do you like that a and b what are they saying the destination is what is obama and his
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:39.840]  controllers what are they trying to do well i think he's trying to change the fundamental
[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:47.920]  change the fundamental approach with his very liberal approach toward trying to make the
[02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:53.760]  military a social experiment and and trying to he's never been a fan of the military anyway
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:59.360]  i mean he was a he was a community organizer and then he becomes president uh there's there's no
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:05.440]  he has no experience no uh background but what about it i don't mean to interrupt sir but what
[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:10.640]  about his advisors if you wanted to kill the military this is what you do why isn't the
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:15.520]  establishment stopping him well the establishment scared to death because they're going to be out
[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:21.360]  i mean this is why one of my stories had to do with uh valerie jarrett she's she's the uh
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:27.920]  she's what we call the night stalker and uh she's uh she's one who guides and counsels him
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:33.920]  she's very leftist uh leaning and uh and has roots that go back to uh communist socialist uh
[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:40.480]  uh practices at at at the local level in chicago many many years before uh this is and now they're
[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:46.000]  just brought it up to the national level and and this is part of a plan of theirs and and the fact
[02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:53.200]  that dhs is receiving so many uh so much ammunition and getting the uh troop carriers and things like
[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:58.800]  this it has i've had some folks suggest to me that there is a possibility that um that he is
[02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:04.960]  planning something to uh to uh basically to not not only emasculate the military but actually
[02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:11.200]  create his own strong civilian force the question is why i mean they've been uh congress should
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:15.520]  have been pursuing this as to why that this is happening they they've never gotten a straight
[02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:22.240]  answer and yet uh congress is uh still overlooking this possibility of this this problem of why
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:27.200]  dhs is arming the way it is dhs is part of the problem they got other issues that they've got
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:32.800]  to deal with and not the least of which is dealing with natural catastrophes and and yet they want
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:36.720]  to do another fighting well that's another issue they've pivoted talking about pivoting from the
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:43.520]  middle east to asia they have pivoted like 95 from al-qaeda i get the manuals the police send
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:49.360]  them to me we break them on the national news all the time 95 pivot i mean it'll be like a hundred
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:54.240]  page training manual i don't publish a lot of these because it could it could be actually
[02:38:54.240 --> 02:38:58.560]  damaging the real national script we show the cover sheets and stuff 95 of it will be about
[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:04.480]  tea party gun owners veterans christians and then like one page on al-qaeda yeah they see they see
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:10.000]  the threat more from within than from without and i think that this is what we're what we're
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:14.480]  seeing is pretty much what happened during the clinton years that he never wanted to talk about
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:20.000]  after the 1993 uh world trade center bombing that there was actually a terrorist that that was a
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:25.120]  terrorist act it was a criminal act by some disgruntled people uh there was a failure to
[02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:30.160]  want to recognize sure do have an external threat but it's more internal with your lone wolves and
[02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:37.680]  your and your uh right what what he would refer to as your right wing militant militant groups
[02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:43.360]  and that's where i think the dhs is looking more as to where the threat is coming from within
[02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:48.000]  sure well i mean i mean here's my issue sir you're a smart guy i have a lot of military in my
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:55.760]  family i've literally read probably uh 500 books on military history study it i know i don't know
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:40:00.880]  the tip of the iceberg i look at valerie jarrett i've read her papers i've seen her give speeches
[02:40:00.880 --> 02:40:06.560]  she's a low-grade moron the woman looks mentally ill and i'm sorry well our country and i'm not
[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:10.560]  usually the guy that goes with the theory of incompetence but that's even more frightening
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:16.640]  that the elite running this country are a bunch of incompetent dumb commies i mean i'll use that
[02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:22.080]  low pejorative it's what they are who literally are social engineering and that's 10 times more
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:27.280]  scary than an in control elite because at least an in control elite doesn't want to blow the planet
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:33.680]  up these middle patients look what they've done with obama care they this is a disaster i mean i
[02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:38.480]  think obama needs to be impeached i know world net daly's leading a big group i have to try to get
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:44.480]  that done coming up in a few weeks i mean what do here's my final question what do we do well i mean
[02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:51.680]  a uh do you agree with me these are very unstable weirdos and then b uh what what are the generals
[02:40:51.680 --> 02:40:58.000]  and others saying that we can do any ideas to try to stop this well i think well the first of all
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:02.960]  yes i would agree with you that these are unstable weirdos they they have their own agenda they're
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:07.840]  in the position of power right now the argument is well you voted for them but we've got to live with
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:13.200]  it and uh i've had a lot of people in comments on my some of my stories saying well maybe we
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:19.920]  maybe we need to be uh taking taking uh taking back the government and uh uh and and there's
[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:24.800]  talk like that now that's uh coming coming through people are very alarmed and i think but there's
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:30.720]  nothing that you can do about it short of taking up arms and it seems uh because that we we we live
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:36.960]  under a a nation of laws and and we voted for the man and uh or there's many many people voted for
[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:41.520]  men i know i didn't but uh but then we have to live with it until the next election i was about
[02:41:41.520 --> 02:41:46.000]  to say though i mean take the military strategy we say they're a bunch of buffoons but they've got
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:50.960]  they're ready they want a civil war they want to push us that's what the navy seals on and off record
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:56.160]  including a naval officer told me uh who's commanded large groups of seals i'll just leave it at that
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:42:01.840]  and then we've had the seals on the show that that's their analysis the navy that the navy special
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:06.320]  warfare people have looked at this and they say it's exactly what you were just alluding to
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:10.880]  they want to push us into this but then we have no choice but maybe we do so let me ask you as a
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:15.520]  smart guy who's talked to all these other folks what do we do we don't want a civil war with poor
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:20.480]  cops and military that are just following orders but we can't go under commie control what do we do
[02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:26.560]  i think we have to continue publicly uh bringing this out i think people who are in the system
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:30.960]  and people who have just come out they need to speak out of course they they're they're still
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:35.440]  concerned even in in retirement if they want to get contractor jobs and what have you but
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:41.680]  uh we've got this we we are at a at a point where uh things could really uh turn south on us and
[02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:46.880]  that this this is what uh and we need to be bringing this out more and more and just keep
[02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:52.080]  hammering it and hammering it uh to really uh make this resonate and the people's consciousness
[02:42:52.080 --> 02:42:57.440]  and i would agree with um uh congressman west that we we need a congressional oversight and
[02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:01.840]  just what is really going on not that anything will ever come of it but the mere fact that it's
[02:43:01.840 --> 02:43:06.800]  being brought out publicly i think is going to be necessary to keep to uh keep i agree and for
[02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:12.160]  those that don't know um you know well that's why you have the congress commission officers to begin
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:16.960]  with because you just can't have a napoleon or a hitler run all the military themselves that's
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:23.040]  always the bane of any free civilization as a julia seizer comes along and i think i really
[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:27.440]  think these people running things well they talk about they talk about they want him to be a dictator
[02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:32.720]  wanting to have declare marshal law you know cila jackson lee so i think i i mean we need to listen
[02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:36.800]  to what these people are saying absolutely and and and deal with it in closing and i appreciate
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:43.520]  your time sir uh tell us about your new book a nation forsaken boy that says it all yes well
[02:43:43.520 --> 02:43:49.440]  that that was whole idea the uh federal government has let us down and and trying to protect this
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:56.320]  country against an electromagnetic pulse either from natural from the sun or from man made which
[02:43:56.320 --> 02:44:01.520]  can be a some little small country with a nuclear weapon in a and a means of delivery systems have
[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:07.120]  been just exploded over at a high altitude and and knock out our national grid and and and all
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:13.120]  of the other uh critical life-sustaining critical infrastructures which depend upon that grid they
[02:44:13.120 --> 02:44:19.440]  can do it with one blast and we're not ready for it and we have not equipped our uh and we have not
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:27.440]  um hardened our our facilities uh whether it's for uh telecommunications or our pipelines um
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:34.400]  our our even our emergency responders you know they would also be affected our hospitals would
[02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:39.120]  be affected uh because we're totally dependent i mean look at the depression most americans were
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:44.160]  self-sufficient and it was devastating if we have something like this now oh yeah all the experts
[02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:48.320]  i talked to i haven't read your book yet i want to read it but i mean they say this is something
[02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:54.640]  we don't come back from at least not in the way we have been that's right well uh jim wilsey has
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:45:00.640]  and uh new gingrich has recently formed a an emp coalition and they're they're talking about this
[02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:04.720]  now they're trying to get a a national effort underway to get congress to pass what's called
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:09.040]  the shield act i don't think it's going to pass so it might pass from the house but certainly
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:15.280]  not in the senate uh and also working more with the states to get the uh legislators at the state
[02:45:15.280 --> 02:45:21.760]  level to to uh to direct their public utilities to start hardening these facilities we can mitigate
[02:45:21.760 --> 02:45:26.800]  this problem with just two billion dollars across nation that's right if we if we put our minds to
[02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:32.080]  two billion dollars that they'll spend instead to put in transgender bathrooms i mean it's just
[02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:37.120]  unbelievable well listen i really appreciate you joining us mr maloof and your your analysis
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:41.360]  and unfortunately i concur with all of it and i just hope we can make it out of this i mean it's
[02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:47.680]  good news that obama care is finally blowing up so bad that i think i think this could be the you
[02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:51.840]  know the end of obama being able to get stuff done the problem is he just signs executive orders like
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:56.320]  shutting down our power plant speaking of power and does this let me ask you this are we at the
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:46:01.840]  most dangerous point right now then because obama's sinking like a rock but that's when he might
[02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:06.960]  try something and and and what could that be to get his agenda back on track well yeah it'll be
[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:12.720]  the tail wagging the dog episode uh you know people talk about what is he can he be impeached for this
[02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:17.920]  he lied to the american people well he also lied to congress and that should be a misdemeanor right
[02:46:17.920 --> 02:46:24.640]  there he lied to congress about obama care uh in which people would not be able to lose use lose
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:30.480]  their doctors or their other health care and and on the basis of that they went ahead and passed
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:35.760]  that legislation without without any republican support certainly but it did go through the
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:42.320]  it did go through the uh it did go through the congress and as a consequence uh they they now
[02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:48.960]  are finding that it's just not true and so that to me is is something maybe the legal types need
[02:46:48.960 --> 02:46:55.520]  to look at did he lie in lying to the congress the way he did did he um and to get that legislation
[02:46:55.520 --> 02:47:00.720]  passed has he in fact committed a misdemeanor which is under the constitution impeachable
[02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:05.440]  it certainly is we've got to send a message that we're not going to pull up with this type
[02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:11.200]  of just rampant craziness and control freak behavior thank you so much for your time well thanks for
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:15.680]  helping me wow that was a scary interview but you know folks we're not trying to scare you
[02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:22.240]  i'm the type of guy that if if it's flooding and i need to go to higher ground
[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:27.040]  then i go to higher ground it's not that i'm living in fear i woke up three weeks ago
[02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:33.120]  open my back door looking on to the property that have a small piece of property there's
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:40.400]  a ranch behind me and there was a no exaggeration i was saying 500 foot wide no it was i actually
[02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:50.880]  kind of guesstimated measured it about a thousand feet past the my property on over the fence line
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:57.680]  giant barton creek was like a just torrent of like white rapids blasting out of a fire hose
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:03.840]  and it was coming up to our property line up to the fence all the way up to the
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:08.480]  pillars of our house because our house is built on stilts because it's it's it's in an area that
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:16.320]  floods every 50 years and it kept rising and rising and it wasn't that i was living in fear
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:21.840]  that i went out looked out the window and saw the water rising and i walked down i said oh honey
[02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:26.320]  it's not raining anymore it's raining for 12 hours straight we're up near the headwaters it should be
[02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:32.160]  okay um i don't think it's going to be an issue and then obviously my children and wife are freaked
[02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:36.240]  out i'm no hydrologist but i could tell it's not raining anymore we're up near the headwaters it
[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:41.440]  should be okay but i said if it keeps raining it might knock out our porch and stuff so we
[02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:45.440]  might have to leave but i said and i went look at the weather reporter wasn't gonna keep raining so
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:51.120]  it was all right and then when then a few hours it went back down to like 50 feet across so
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:56.480]  so it was knocking trees over you know and it was i mean it was like a major river
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:49:01.840]  blasting by my house from just a sad creek that goes into martin creek the reason i
[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:08.400]  tell that analogy now is or or that story as an analogy of what we're currently under i mean
[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:13.920]  i'm just watching a giant rising waters of tyranny and i'm sitting here going um
[02:49:16.160 --> 02:49:20.720]  we need to say no to this and i'm getting called an extremist and a radical and i want to kill
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:26.080]  cops and i want to kill people and i don't want to kill anybody i just want to be a nice guy
[02:49:26.960 --> 02:49:32.160]  i just want to live in a free country our government sold us out to china and others
[02:49:33.200 --> 02:49:37.520]  undermining us at the same time attacking anything good i mean these people are just
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:42.960]  deviance i've now come to realization they are deviance deviant not like they want to go have
[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:46.480]  sex with somebody i've learned that's not even really what you call deviance that's like the
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:52.560]  distractionary deviance it's the deviance of like screwing things up and messing with things and
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:58.080]  doing nasty things and doing bad things and we all need to be like dylan radigan six months
[02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:02.000]  ago that got fired she's going this is all corrupt we're in trouble this is but you flipped out
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:05.840]  because he's there around all the lives you're supposed to flip out you're supposed to say
[02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:12.960]  i'm not going to be part of this anymore like um howard bill and network and that's all i've done
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:20.240]  i mean i went because military told me about it and i saw marines training to take our guns in
[02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:24.720]  america and i was a mainline libertarian republican then and i was like oh my gosh
[02:50:26.560 --> 02:50:29.360]  and i found out about the whole plan they've been trying this forever
[02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:34.160]  they don't they already run everything they don't need to be doing all this they should
[02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:40.080]  they literally want to go after families they literally want our guns they want to break us
[02:50:40.080 --> 02:50:45.440]  they want to dominate us i mean it's not a they already run everything folks they are they want
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:51.680]  to screw us over they hate us it's like racism against native americans and they've already been

[02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:36.400]  they began to run it on down to mississippi to the guffam xico we looked down a river and we
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:41.200]  see the british come and they must have been a hundred of beating on the drums they stepped so
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:45.920]  high and they made the bugles ring we stood beside our cotton veils didn't say a thousand
[02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:52.080]  troops and the british kept becoming there wasn't as many as there was a while ago we fired once
[02:54:52.080 --> 02:54:56.960]  more and they began to run it on down to mississippi to the guffam xico they started civil war folks
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:06.320]  those of us in leadership will be killed first and i'm not even worried about that i'm worried
[02:55:06.320 --> 02:55:11.760]  about beating these guys in the end there's things bigger than one person's life there's the children
[02:55:11.760 --> 02:55:17.680]  and there's justice to be served i don't want this physical war to come and i'm doing everything
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:26.880]  i can and on my knees every day before my almighty creator asking for the for the guidance
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:36.240]  but you know sometimes in god's plan bad things happen we're here so that people have a choice
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:41.040]  in their heart to make about which side they're going to be on in their heart and that's the most
[02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:45.680]  important decision none of us can do this alone we don't know what the outcome is going to be
[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:53.040]  short term but we know that in the end right always comes out on top it may take a hundred years
[02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:59.360]  may take six months may take a day we don't know what's in store for us there's a lot of
[02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:07.760]  twists and turns in this but everybody can feel the great danger we're all in we can tell history
[02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:14.400]  is already happening and is about to happen and i feel like every day this could be my last broadcast
[02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:23.360]  here and everybody can tell hearing me on the air that and you can feel it as well this is
[02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:30.320]  history happening right now and you need to decide who your heart's with it's real simple if you want
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:35.760]  to break it down to men he certainly wasn't perfect but if you studied him he had amazing
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:43.200]  courage and leadership and providence are you with george washington or are you with barack obama
[02:56:45.840 --> 02:56:52.320]  are you with people like martin luther king who wasn't perfect but had a lot of courage and vision
[02:56:53.200 --> 02:57:00.960]  or are you with people like hillary clinton you're gonna have to make a decision you got to decide
[02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:04.800]  in life it didn't about how many bobbles you got it didn't how many people know who you are
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:09.920]  believing i've got that it means nothing it matters what you stand for and what you did
[02:57:11.040 --> 02:57:16.800]  it's not about the toys folks it's about what you did it's the erin tippin cheesy song but it's
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:21.280]  not cheesy we say it's cheesy because we feel cheesy when we feel like doing the right thing
[02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:26.720]  like that's bad no that's good you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:31.520]  you've got to be your own man not a puppet on the string never compromise what's right
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:36.640]  and uphold your family name you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
[02:57:38.480 --> 02:57:44.160]  yeah we might have had more money been better off live in a better house if dad had done more
[02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:52.000]  given in a little more back and down but in the final equation ladies and gentlemen
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:58.480]  we have a civilization because people didn't bend over and bow down that's why the corrupt
[02:57:58.480 --> 02:58:04.240]  don't always try to attack those that are pure of heart to tell us we're impure to tell us we're
[02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:10.240]  frauds to tell us we're lies because they they then know that that affects us then we'll give up
[02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:16.320]  thinking we're not worthy to fight evil you understand that they are willfully evil their
[02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:23.040]  hearts are evil that's the difference we are willfully good we have good will we have courage
[02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:30.880]  we have honor we have strength we have the future if we take it in our hands now is the time to
[02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:38.160]  choose which side you serve now is the time to give your heart to liberty or to tyranny overdrive

[03:00:57.200 --> 03:01:05.520]  be stopped but i don't know quote star wars i feel a disturbance in the force let's talk to
[03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:13.920]  roi in michigan you're on the air go ahead hello yes sir yes sir long time listener first time
[03:01:13.920 --> 03:01:19.600]  caller thanks for holding brother i've been trying for a month to get through to you i heard on the
[03:01:19.600 --> 03:01:28.080]  radio to uh you needed to have uh obama care and obama sport supporters call up so i called and
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:34.000]  i got thrown the first ring well you're here if you're here right yeah all right um i think this
[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:39.680]  purge is a little bit deeper than what we are afraid of not so much afraid of but concerned with
[03:01:39.680 --> 03:01:47.120]  um i have a lot of friends in the military um and they are they are they brigadier generals
[03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:53.200]  no they're not but they are reservists sure i mean that's important actually you think the
[03:01:53.200 --> 03:01:57.760]  intel's at the top it's always at the bottom too because they're actually getting the missions
[03:01:57.760 --> 03:02:01.520]  so even though they'll call it something else you can decode what the real plan is but go
[03:02:01.520 --> 03:02:08.240]  ahead and tell me your point um my point is is if uh they're purging the military they're purging
[03:02:08.240 --> 03:02:14.800]  the top brass and they're calling up the reservists to go over to afghanistan for whatever
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:21.120]  that means that they're getting deeper into our military than you do you get what i mean they
[03:02:21.120 --> 03:02:26.640]  start the top they're exhausting they're exhausting the reserves and they're also sending our people
[03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:35.040]  over to be sitting ducks for the uh taliban yeah we're talking about national guards uh guys that
[03:02:35.040 --> 03:02:39.360]  are in the reserves you know they do their weekly you know weekend thing they do their couple times
[03:02:39.360 --> 03:02:44.240]  yeah that's also so they can bring them back battle hard and to be against the american people but
[03:02:44.240 --> 03:02:51.840]  yeah they're gonna find out who's who and and i i believe they're using afghanistan to filter them
[03:02:53.760 --> 03:02:58.400]  nope you know what you're talking about that's the exact thing i said it you're saying we agree
[03:02:58.400 --> 03:03:04.240]  that's what's going on so what's what what's that mean prime projection i i think that we're
[03:03:04.240 --> 03:03:11.600]  closer than like you said i feel it you feel it something there's a darkness something's there
[03:03:11.600 --> 03:03:17.360]  something's there something's there yeah it's unbelievable yeah really bad it's so bad i'm
[03:03:17.360 --> 03:03:23.200]  completely calm now yeah i don't have to explain it it's so horrible now i'm like the fuck it's here

[03:08:20.960 --> 03:08:23.440]  you know it was six seven months ago that dylan radigan
[03:08:23.440 --> 03:08:31.200]  had his quote meltdown flip out and got basically pushed out of msnbc cnbc he did stuff on both
[03:08:31.200 --> 03:08:40.000]  channels he just told it like it was and acted like a man a man is supposed to care about the
[03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:46.640]  stability of society and being fair not being part of a gang people should hate gangs in government
[03:08:46.640 --> 03:08:51.360]  anywhere else they should hate abusers they should hate frauds and they should instinctively do
[03:08:51.360 --> 03:08:58.480]  everything they can to deny aid and comfort to those people real simple but instead we kiss
[03:08:58.480 --> 03:09:03.840]  up to tyranny like it's going to be nice to us that only intensifies it john in florida you called
[03:09:03.840 --> 03:09:07.680]  in we pulled up the article it's true they're not giving people unemployment benefits with
[03:09:07.680 --> 03:09:12.960]  saying it's a glitch in florida this is clearly with the ebt things and obama care we know the
[03:09:12.960 --> 03:09:17.280]  obama care they knew that this was gonna happen their excuse now to deny stuff is it's a glitch
[03:09:17.280 --> 03:09:22.080]  because they found in psychological warfare if they just say stuff screwed up you don't take it
[03:09:22.080 --> 03:09:28.160]  personal like it was denied you just go die on the ditch so this is undoubtedly the banksters
[03:09:29.040 --> 03:09:32.240]  and again as much as i don't like dependency because they always do this in the end
[03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:37.520]  it's like it's something i don't want to give a domesticated animal food i don't want to starve
[03:09:37.520 --> 03:09:41.040]  an animal it's like you shouldn't domesticate it if you know you're not going to take care of it
[03:09:42.160 --> 03:09:46.160]  and it's unsustainable so see it's it's not like are you for welfare are you against welfare
[03:09:46.160 --> 03:09:52.240]  no i'm for local welfare but the real welfare of don't give them in fish teach him how to fish
[03:09:52.240 --> 03:09:56.400]  you starve to death cook him some fish get him and say i'm gonna show you how to catch fish here
[03:09:56.960 --> 03:10:00.320]  and then if you won't catch fish it tells you to do it well you're not his slave
[03:10:00.320 --> 03:10:08.640]  they're just bringing slavery back here now let's go ahead and go back to your calls and
[03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:13.440]  i got dylan radigan and what he did and a lot of stuff i haven't gotten to yet i've got obama
[03:10:13.440 --> 03:10:18.720]  in dallas trying to chill the foreign bank takeover care uh because he's supposed to take
[03:10:18.720 --> 03:10:23.360]  the blame as obama care it's only foreign bank occupy america rape america foreign tax foreign
[03:10:23.360 --> 03:10:31.040]  banks uh scam care um but uh john in florida you brought that up anything else yeah what people
[03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:36.160]  need to realize is you know there's two weeks that they're waiting on before this problem even
[03:10:36.160 --> 03:10:41.040]  happened so they're into five and six weeks i'm not getting paid can you imagine no paycheck for
[03:10:41.040 --> 03:10:46.400]  that long no i can't imagine it i i i i make a little bit of money and i mean i don't have enough
[03:10:46.400 --> 03:10:51.040]  money so i can't imagine folks that uh are living paycheck to paycheck it must be horrible
[03:10:52.080 --> 03:10:55.520]  i'm smarter than the average bear and i got my claim paid and i just want to help some people
[03:10:55.520 --> 03:11:00.320]  here if you can't get through to their number which they shut off okay call the governor's
[03:11:00.320 --> 03:11:07.440]  office at eight five oh four eight eight seven one four six you should be able to get directly
[03:11:07.440 --> 03:11:12.320]  through to somebody at the unemployment office but last week dude they had four people answering
[03:11:12.320 --> 03:11:17.600]  those phone calls but the girl told me specifically she gave me some specifics that's why off air i'd
[03:11:17.600 --> 03:11:21.280]  like you to give me an email address to send this information to you it'll help you out a lot with
[03:11:21.280 --> 03:11:28.000]  the story i agree brother um why don't you put him on off air and have him send it to rob do's email
[03:11:28.880 --> 03:11:33.120]  uh and and rob do will get on to it by monday and a lot of stuff falls to the cracks always feel
[03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:37.600]  bad we can't get it done my crew's working hard just it's like we're like good batters but it's
[03:11:37.600 --> 03:11:42.080]  like they have like eight batting machines shooting balls at us it's like when Luke Skywalker has
[03:11:42.080 --> 03:11:46.560]  Darth Vader throwing all that stuff at him he can't hit it all i mean it's it's pretty pathetic at
[03:11:46.560 --> 03:11:52.160]  a certain point myself included i i mean i get in here someday so focused and there's like 500
[03:11:52.160 --> 03:11:57.840]  articles and by the end of it i was like because each one triggers a brainstorm you know and it's
[03:11:57.840 --> 03:12:06.800]  just at a certain point talk is oh my goodness oh man i this feels like a wake is what it feels like
[03:12:06.800 --> 03:12:11.120]  but also like a birth it's like the feeling when a baby's been born because liberty is always rising
[03:12:11.120 --> 03:12:16.400]  but it's also like i'm you know some loved family members dead more remembering stories about them
[03:12:16.400 --> 03:12:25.040]  them versus totally overrun by evil right now
[03:12:27.040 --> 03:12:32.240]  and we need people to get a heart again because people think it's manly to not care people think
[03:12:32.240 --> 03:12:38.080]  it's manly to be dishonest and manipulative and it's not it's it's it's it's pathetic
[03:12:40.880 --> 03:12:45.600]  and i'm telling you folks the globalists are plunging right now they're going to stage something
[03:12:45.600 --> 03:12:50.480]  and i you know this has happened before and bad stuff happens i hope it gets stopped but i feel
[03:12:51.040 --> 03:12:56.720]  i feel beyond dread right now and i don't know what's really happening i don't know what's
[03:12:56.720 --> 03:13:01.600]  there's so many different things in flux i know what the cards are in the deck i don't know what
[03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:13.840]  card's gonna come out of that hand and just pray to sweet jesus that's all i can tell you folks
[03:13:13.840 --> 03:13:21.680]  let's talk to cat in new york cat you're on the air go ahead hi alex hey talk about cards in the
[03:13:21.680 --> 03:13:28.720]  deck how funny it is i'm calling you exactly for that reason um and this is one card in the deck
[03:13:28.720 --> 03:13:34.880]  that i haven't heard anybody mention so i'm going to exercise my first amendment right while we
[03:13:34.880 --> 03:13:41.440]  still have it and tell you what my theory is on what they may do okay and then i'm not i'm only
[03:13:41.440 --> 03:13:46.000]  going to take up like a minute of your time because i know you're on overdrive and then that's okay go
[03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:51.120]  ahead you can tell me what you think um i don't think the mainstream media has had a sudden change
[03:13:51.120 --> 03:13:56.400]  in consciousness i think that they're doing exactly what they're being told to do um as far as like
[03:13:56.400 --> 03:14:02.960]  janine caro ripping him to shrubs on fox news and run back i don't think that these people have
[03:14:02.960 --> 03:14:08.000]  have had a sudden change in heart i think that they're still being told what to do i think it's
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:14.560]  all part of the agenda and i think with him being compared to lincoln and and i'm wanting to start a
[03:14:14.560 --> 03:14:22.800]  race riot in a civil war in america i think it's possible that they may stage an assassination
[03:14:22.800 --> 03:14:29.280]  against our president and use a white taxi to start a race riot in america no i know i know i've
[03:14:29.280 --> 03:14:35.360]  always said obama could be the false flag i agree and then he gets shot in the head and miraculously
[03:14:35.360 --> 03:14:41.600]  lives i mean it's just you don't have no idea the last thing we want is is any shooting i mean if
[03:14:41.600 --> 03:14:45.200]  there's going to be shooting it needs to be they shoot at us it's obvious it's on record
[03:14:46.560 --> 03:14:50.400]  who even wants it it's just like look they want that i don't want that it's very simple
[03:14:50.400 --> 03:14:55.920]  they want it i don't want it they want it you shouldn't want it there's so many military people
[03:14:55.920 --> 03:15:00.240]  that have you know done a lot of killing that are just ready to go crazy and i'm telling you folks we
[03:15:00.240 --> 03:15:05.520]  need to hold our fire till we see the whites of their eyes we need to wait till they're attacking us
[03:15:05.520 --> 03:15:10.720]  people say well you lose the initiative this isn't about a regular military engagement it's a moral
[03:15:10.720 --> 03:15:18.800]  victory folks besides i guarantee you the people calling for civil war on the liberty side i understand
[03:15:18.800 --> 03:15:23.680]  why they're upset but they're going to be the first people that are going to crap their pants
[03:15:23.680 --> 03:15:30.560]  when the hammer drops but you're going to see people that never talked about doing anything
[03:15:30.560 --> 03:15:37.440]  they're going to take action and i would assure those working for the system you will be destroyed
[03:15:38.320 --> 03:15:44.720]  and the globalists will sit offshore laughing the entire time we don't need this we don't need to
[03:15:44.720 --> 03:15:50.880]  be a joke we don't need to be a failure we don't need to dance to their tune we don't need to do
[03:15:50.880 --> 03:15:56.000]  this if you've got any sense in you in the establishment you better sabotage this crap
[03:15:56.000 --> 03:16:03.280]  right now i mean politically economically whatever you got to do you need to just not comply
[03:16:03.840 --> 03:16:08.800]  need to just put yourself against the machine against the machine together we can stop this
[03:16:09.520 --> 03:16:15.280]  but i'm telling you we're entering the vortex right now anything else uh there cat
[03:16:15.280 --> 03:16:21.200]  no i just i just think that it's important that we realize that and remember that the
[03:16:21.200 --> 03:16:26.480]  mainstream media is still being controlled and i totally agree and they're only doing this because
[03:16:26.480 --> 03:16:33.440]  they're losing credibility but people like dylan radigan who got fired removed for flipping out
[03:16:33.440 --> 03:16:37.280]  they don't want that energy that's why there was a defeat with pierce morgan they said oh he failed
[03:16:37.280 --> 03:16:41.840]  he lost because we won i was like you want my guns you're an enemy you'll never get him i'm never
[03:16:41.840 --> 03:16:47.200]  surrendering oh how discredited he'll never surrender that's a battle cry they don't want
[03:16:47.200 --> 03:16:52.240]  you to have any spirit and radigan did that so they got rid of him and now he's out with his
[03:16:52.240 --> 03:16:58.720]  premium it's up on info wars dot com up 350 god bless you ma'am i appreciate your call appreciate
[03:16:58.720 --> 03:17:03.040]  you listening to us and putting up with me uh in fact speaking of radigan i'm going to skip this
[03:17:03.040 --> 03:17:06.000]  network break or the bottom of the hour i'm going to play this clip and get to some other clips i've
[03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:14.320]  got uh here is dylan radigan quote in his meltdown earlier this year that got him brought out but
[03:17:14.320 --> 03:17:19.760]  don't worry so you can't have dylan radigan there he'll actually go on msnbc and say my rate went
[03:17:19.760 --> 03:17:27.760]  from 170 this year to 600 that's an increase well obama said when you raise the debt limit is an
[03:17:27.760 --> 03:17:33.280]  increase so this is magical math here and you're supposed to just feel powerless to go along with
[03:17:33.280 --> 03:17:39.520]  it well you know what i got my butt kicked a lot of times but they never mess with me again
[03:17:39.520 --> 03:17:44.080]  even though they were a lot tougher than i was most of the time i won the fight but a few times
[03:17:44.080 --> 03:17:48.000]  i've fought people that like to flash so strong so quick you couldn't even do anything to them
[03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:52.400]  when they'd be leaning over me i'd get up and punch him right in the throat
[03:17:52.960 --> 03:17:57.360]  an hour later they'd be in the hospital with a tracheotomy and you know it doesn't matter it's
[03:17:57.360 --> 03:18:05.200]  the fighting spirit that matters it's the will to fight makes an enemy move on and we need
[03:18:05.200 --> 03:18:10.080]  to find that spirit again because that's the spirit of liberty we don't start fights we finish him
[03:18:10.080 --> 03:18:16.480]  we don't start wars we finish him we don't look for trouble we take out trouble and that's what
[03:18:16.480 --> 03:18:21.680]  we do and we've got the moral authority on our side and our enemies are freaked out i can look
[03:18:21.680 --> 03:18:26.960]  at them on television and tell you they are scared and you know what they should be they have signed
[03:18:26.960 --> 03:18:35.920]  on to some bad stuff they they have signed on to mucho evil and i said i go to this clip let's go
[03:18:35.920 --> 03:18:39.840]  to the guy who's now speaking out about it was screwed with obama care this is a guy removed
[03:18:39.840 --> 03:18:46.880]  from television for literally just acting like a man here it is we owe 70 trillion dollars
[03:18:46.880 --> 03:18:51.440]  but it goes due to walk out a four trillion dollar solution which is basically just a way for the
[03:18:51.440 --> 03:18:56.800]  democrats to avoid dealing with this until 2017 i'm not here to talk about plans to deal with
[03:18:56.800 --> 03:19:02.480]  this till 2017 i'm saying we've got a real problem and i'm tired of republicans and democrats who
[03:19:02.480 --> 03:19:06.560]  either want republicans who want to burn the place to the ground and democrats with all due respect
[03:19:06.560 --> 03:19:10.720]  who want to offer a plan that gets it through the night their end of their second term of their
[03:19:10.720 --> 03:19:16.800]  presidency and then screws me and my kids when it's over until we do that we have to deal with the
[03:19:16.800 --> 03:19:20.880]  extraction that is at foot it is the reason the financial markets are behaving the way they're
[03:19:20.880 --> 03:19:27.600]  behaving that is a mathematical fact i this is not some opinion this is a mathematical fact
[03:19:27.600 --> 03:19:34.000]  tens of millions of dollars are being extracted from the united states of america democrats aren't
[03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:39.920]  doing it republicans are not doing it an entire integrated system financial system trading system
[03:19:39.920 --> 03:19:46.080]  taxing system that was created by both parties over a period of two decades is that work on our
[03:19:46.080 --> 03:19:51.760]  entire country right now and we're sitting here arguing about whether we should do the four trillion
[03:19:51.760 --> 03:19:56.880]  dollar plan that kicks the can down the road for the president for 2017 or burn the place to the
[03:19:56.880 --> 03:20:04.080]  ground both of which are reckless irresponsible and stupid and the fact of the matter is until we
[03:20:04.080 --> 03:20:08.000]  actually and i don't and i'm sorry to lose my temper and get but i'll tell you what i've been
[03:20:08.000 --> 03:20:14.400]  coming on tv for three years doing this and the fact of the matter is that there is a refusal on
[03:20:14.400 --> 03:20:19.760]  both the democratic and the republican side of the aisle to acknowledge the mathematical problem
[03:20:19.760 --> 03:20:25.600]  which is that a united states of america is being extracted it's being extracted through banking
[03:20:25.600 --> 03:20:30.400]  it's being extracted through trade and it's being extracted through taxation of mine there's not a
[03:20:30.400 --> 03:20:35.760]  single politician that has stepped forward susan to deal with it but i gotta say this on a scale of
[03:20:35.760 --> 03:20:41.440]  one to ten of absolute veritas and humanity that's a ten my peers morgan was about a seven
[03:20:41.440 --> 03:20:45.360]  because you know he was messing with me and interrupting me and playing games but still
[03:20:45.360 --> 03:20:50.640]  there's never there's never been a probably a seven before that there's like a seven and
[03:20:50.640 --> 03:20:54.720]  there's dylan radigan and i've forgotten about that clip till i saw his thing that we should
[03:20:54.720 --> 03:20:59.760]  add that in there just the guys like look what does it matter if i make a million dollars a year
[03:20:59.760 --> 03:21:06.720]  my kid's future is totally screwed do you people get it we're crashing we're screwed new world order
[03:21:06.720 --> 03:21:13.840]  we're being stripped mind god what in the world it'd be like if somebody said i'll pay a million
[03:21:13.840 --> 03:21:19.040]  dollars you let me kill your kid to be like how about i kill you my kids what matters not your
[03:21:19.040 --> 03:21:25.360]  million stinking dollars instead we arrest people who still love a bread and then we let the global
[03:21:25.360 --> 03:21:33.760]  of still trillions i'm sick of it man i got three kids three of them all you little fake punks that
[03:21:33.760 --> 03:21:39.040]  work for the system want to fight with me i'm trying to save your lives you dumbasses you start
[03:21:39.040 --> 03:21:43.840]  a fight with us the american people are gonna absolutely slaughter your ass up one side down
[03:21:43.840 --> 03:21:49.520]  the other you think i want to pile your dead bodies up 100 excuse me hit the lay on that i am
[03:21:49.520 --> 03:21:57.920]  getting sick of this crap i am so sick of all this stuff i'm so sick of people acting like idiots
[03:21:57.920 --> 03:22:05.280]  it's we are being stripped mind we are being extracted we are being harvested to never come
[03:22:05.280 --> 03:22:14.320]  back america is dying right now and i will not sit here and put up with this crap anymore
[03:22:16.720 --> 03:22:22.560]  and they they got rid of him because he has life force because he cares about his kids because
[03:22:22.560 --> 03:22:28.880]  he's not suicidal because he's not mentally ill because he's got wavos hanging between his legs
[03:22:28.880 --> 03:22:35.120]  and common sense in his brain folks you there is no debate we're going down a sewer right now
[03:22:35.120 --> 03:22:40.880]  there is no debate we're going over the edge of a waterfall folks on a razor blade into alcohol
[03:22:42.160 --> 03:22:48.720]  there is no doubt that we are in deep grievous emergency trouble that the globalists have set
[03:22:48.720 --> 03:22:53.920]  up that's so bad here's the big news they can't even turn it around now they did it and now
[03:22:54.800 --> 03:23:00.000]  i mean this is insane this is insane this is like a satanic art project or something
[03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:03.280]  that we're all living in the middle of okay i want you to understand that right now
[03:23:05.200 --> 03:23:12.000]  and then he had to apologize to two scared women and the other little operative because he dared
[03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:18.880]  go this is all rearranging deck chairs on the titanic by the way i've already said this like you're
[03:23:18.880 --> 03:23:22.960]  i want dylan radigan on the show i don't know where he's working what he's doing but
[03:23:23.840 --> 03:23:28.080]  my guy's way past being scared to go on radical shows radical just means you have a pulse and
[03:23:28.080 --> 03:23:33.360]  aren't a moron conspiracy theorists just means you don't believe known liars uh i mean if you
[03:23:33.360 --> 03:23:37.760]  literally like you have an opinion about how your soup tastes they're saying it's a conspiracy
[03:23:37.760 --> 03:23:42.160]  theory now well let me tell you something i'm a conspiracy theorist i think i'm informed i'm
[03:23:42.160 --> 03:23:48.160]  learning more every day i'm living only one time baby and i want to be free and i live through my
[03:23:48.160 --> 03:23:52.160]  children and their children and i don't like people screwing up children's futures
[03:23:54.240 --> 03:23:58.240]  i mean you look at me i'll tell you what's really scary is we've had powerful corrupt elites
[03:23:58.240 --> 03:24:03.360]  before and i've studied them i mean you look at obama and michelle obama and joe biden on these
[03:24:03.360 --> 03:24:12.960]  people are nothing but narcissus bs artists they're not even that powerful i mean that's what's
[03:24:12.960 --> 03:24:21.520]  pathetic about this is these people these people are not even good villains we're ruled by a bunch
[03:24:21.520 --> 03:24:31.600]  of chicken crap pieces of trash and i just don't like it i don't like him endangering our planet
[03:24:31.600 --> 03:24:38.480]  i want my ancestors i want my progeny just like my ancestors did to look up at a gibbous moon
[03:24:38.480 --> 03:24:46.960]  to look up at a at a harvest moon to look up at the stars i want my progeny to survive and thrive
[03:24:46.960 --> 03:24:54.240]  and and colonize worlds i i just love them they're not even born yet i want them to exist i
[03:24:54.240 --> 03:24:59.600]  i look like a big oak tree or a big beautiful tree and you see its baby trees around it it's just
[03:24:59.600 --> 03:25:05.760]  like you admire that tree i admire my ancestors i just i just turn the whole world over to a bunch
[03:25:05.760 --> 03:25:10.320]  of crazy people turn the whole world over to a bunch of genetic engineers trying to wreck everything
[03:25:10.320 --> 03:25:20.320]  play god no no no no no no and what you're hearing on this show is the instinctive emergency
[03:25:20.320 --> 03:25:26.480]  transmission of our species any of you could speak like this and know this it's truth you jump in that
[03:25:26.480 --> 03:25:32.480]  river man you're going to the river you're not you're part of the river that's why truth flows
[03:25:32.480 --> 03:25:37.360]  ladies and gentlemen it flows i couldn't imagine a lie you like to lie is like figure it out it
[03:25:37.360 --> 03:25:48.480]  feels dirty when you do it i know i'm ranting it's just i will not apologize like radigan did and
[03:25:48.480 --> 03:25:56.080]  of course i know that was more of a play on words but in the land of the blind the one i'd know
[03:25:56.080 --> 03:26:04.240]  one eyed man is king as george arwell said in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a
[03:26:04.240 --> 03:26:11.440]  revolutionary act well i am a revolutionary against tyranny i am a revolutionary against
[03:26:11.440 --> 03:26:17.280]  gangs and corrupt groups that don't deserve to be in charge who didn't get in charge because we
[03:26:17.280 --> 03:26:21.920]  want them in charge because they're the best we've got they're in charge because they hoodwinked us
[03:26:21.920 --> 03:26:27.120]  into being in charge and they're so screwed up they don't have a love of humanity they have a hate
[03:26:27.120 --> 03:26:33.840]  of humanity and they are fundamental enemies of everything we were we are and we will be they will
[03:26:33.840 --> 03:26:42.240]  be the end of us i do not fear physical death i fear death of our species because we are the
[03:26:42.240 --> 03:26:49.520]  species we live forever as long as the species continues you atheist don't believe in a spirit
[03:26:49.520 --> 03:26:55.520]  the space winds blowing right through you the residents all of it's there of course there's a
[03:26:55.520 --> 03:27:04.240]  spirit but below that is the genetic life we live forever just like an oak tree from 10 million years
[03:27:04.240 --> 03:27:11.680]  ago lives today in my yard it has the same love in its cells all the butterflies and all the birds
[03:27:11.680 --> 03:27:17.680]  and all the squirrels that have lived in its branches i love that oak tree and i love humans
[03:27:17.680 --> 03:27:25.040]  my fellow humans a trillion times more than i love that oak tree we have fought and lived and
[03:27:25.040 --> 03:27:31.600]  loved together for so long so many great people sacrificed everything so we would have basic
[03:27:32.240 --> 03:27:38.160]  freedom basic liberty and that great wealth is being squandered right now it's being given away
[03:27:38.160 --> 03:27:45.520]  it's being destroyed it's bleeding out it's a crime against our species it's a crime against
[03:27:45.520 --> 03:27:50.320]  everything that's good the real value in this world is spiritual
[03:27:53.680 --> 03:28:02.800]  and i will not stand aside and let these people run over us and that's not a commitment
[03:28:02.800 --> 03:28:09.440]  that's not a heroic act that is the basic act of a free sentient creature that chooses goodness
[03:28:09.440 --> 03:28:24.880]  that chooses life that chooses to stand for reality we have allowed groups to use manipulation
[03:28:24.880 --> 03:28:33.520]  and fraud to build castles made of sand and to quote one of the greatest guitarists of
[03:28:33.520 --> 03:28:40.160]  all time jimmy hendrix castles of sand crumble into the sea eventually
[03:28:43.120 --> 03:28:47.680]  and when they crumble they will bring down our world because these aren't ancient elites
[03:28:47.680 --> 03:28:52.000]  two thousand three thousand four thousand five thousand years ago engaging in all sorts of
[03:28:52.000 --> 03:28:57.280]  self-destructive behavior these are elites genetically re-engineering the planet in a
[03:28:57.280 --> 03:29:06.800]  destructive way with fish infusion antimatter weapons atomic weapons hydrogen weapons biological
[03:29:06.800 --> 03:29:16.240]  weapons chemical weapons who are not even in control of themselves this is the transmission
[03:29:17.040 --> 03:29:22.800]  this is the warning this is the final warning i'll probably be back sunday four to six p.m
[03:29:22.800 --> 03:29:28.880]  but i'm here to tell you in the scheme of time moment to moment a thousand years is the twinkle
[03:29:28.880 --> 03:29:34.640]  of an eye everything you're seeing is happening now the bombs are dropped the enemies have been
[03:29:34.640 --> 03:29:42.000]  released the soldiers are marching the battle is on the future is in our hands if we seize it now
[03:29:42.000 --> 03:29:52.800]  the war is now decide which sign you'll be on we're on the march the empire's on the run
