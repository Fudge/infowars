[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:35.680]  I am absolutely honored to introduce to you your guest speaker who is a pioneer
[00:35.680 --> 00:43.800]  let me just say this I'm not kidding in the pantheon the pantheon of radio
[00:43.800 --> 00:52.760]  greats from rush to stern people maybe at our forebears Alex Jones will be there
[00:52.760 --> 01:17.720]  because what he's doing is redefining it ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones
[01:22.760 --> 01:31.040]  that guy is as everybody does but I've definitely got to get him on the radio
[01:31.040 --> 01:35.760]  now that was awesome and he did still a lot of my thunder because he's just
[01:35.760 --> 01:39.880]  recognizing reality first off I want to thank everybody for inviting me and the
[01:39.880 --> 01:44.720]  folks that run talkers I want to thank Ted Anderson the last 14 years backing me
[01:44.720 --> 01:50.560]  up with my radio show as it's grown and it's great to be here in New York and
[01:50.560 --> 01:54.280]  I'm glad I flew in after it I cooled down a bit because you know it's cold down
[01:54.280 --> 02:00.520]  there in Texas we can't handle the heat I think that Lionel really encapsulated
[02:00.520 --> 02:04.200]  at the end of his speech where I'm going to begin and that is there is a great
[02:04.200 --> 02:07.200]  transformation happening I mean everybody knows that and I've been
[02:07.200 --> 02:11.920]  invited here because folks in talk radio realize that there's a storm going on
[02:11.920 --> 02:16.600]  well actually that's just the front edge the real storm is coming out the
[02:16.600 --> 02:23.800]  landscape of the future is being formed right now and again all of that is a
[02:23.800 --> 02:27.960]  basic truth that you know what's happening is the social engineers
[02:27.960 --> 02:33.000]  ever Bernays and others got a jump on it and realized it and the Department of
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.080]  War realized it and they all wrote books and they said we're going to basically
[02:37.080 --> 02:42.720]  standardized humanity in the same way that Henry Ford was designing the
[02:42.720 --> 02:47.200]  assembly line okay and so what's happened because of the internet that DARPA
[02:47.200 --> 02:51.240]  and the NSA set up they openly said in the 60s this will control everything
[02:51.240 --> 02:55.120]  will track everything in reality it'll be a total panopticon of surveillance and
[02:55.120 --> 02:59.560]  control so that we can carry out our engineering and this is all public and
[02:59.560 --> 03:04.520]  they said we'll keep people in this tiny reality while the technocracy develops
[03:04.520 --> 03:09.960]  a separate breakaway civilization and they call that the New World Order
[03:09.960 --> 03:15.720]  banking cartel but what's actually happening through that system and and
[03:15.720 --> 03:21.760]  through the claim of national security a whole nother world of technology black
[03:21.760 --> 03:28.080]  ops systems has been developed and the whole ruse of terrorism is the pretext
[03:28.080 --> 03:36.280]  to put the clamp down on the population and then also begin to basically come
[03:36.280 --> 03:42.040]  out in the open with the system where you have the trusted travelers the normal
[03:42.040 --> 03:45.280]  travelers and the untrusted travelers and no one knows how you get on those
[03:45.280 --> 03:49.200]  magical lists it's a new class system and why do I raise that point and then
[03:49.200 --> 03:54.560]  I'll get into new media and ideas that I can impart to you if you think they
[03:54.560 --> 04:01.200]  have any value and it's this what's happened is they they plan to use the
[04:01.200 --> 04:07.960]  worldwide wiretap the web as a control grip but it did blow back there were
[04:07.960 --> 04:13.520]  individuals that recognized what was happening and desperately used that
[04:13.520 --> 04:17.720]  system in a way that the establishment thought we wouldn't they overestimated
[04:17.720 --> 04:23.000]  with their hubris and their arrogance because these technocrats literally have
[04:23.000 --> 04:29.720]  serious delusions of grandeur and because that's happened now the population
[04:29.720 --> 04:35.040]  has awakened now they haven't awakened to the full spectrum of what's happening
[04:35.040 --> 04:39.400]  but they've awakened that there's more going on in the world than the top three
[04:39.400 --> 04:45.360]  or four stories every day and they've awakened to that major changes are
[04:45.360 --> 04:52.040]  happening and in their gun they're they're searching and in that searching
[04:52.040 --> 04:55.800]  and getting outside the box to use the cliche and they're getting outside of
[04:55.800 --> 05:04.080]  that box in that box and hi folks this is Alex Jones I'm looking for people that

[08:03.280 --> 08:09.840]  the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:34.080 --> 08:40.040]  well we have some really good news today also a lot of a bad news but there is a
[08:40.040 --> 08:47.640]  lot of good news on the front of awakening on the front in the fight that
[08:47.640 --> 08:53.480]  we're waging to attempt to get people to start thinking about who runs our
[08:53.480 --> 08:57.360]  society the things that were told by our governments the things that were told
[08:57.360 --> 09:05.840]  by the major mega corporations so we are having some major victories in the
[09:05.840 --> 09:11.200]  war that's going on for all of our minds because if we're going to save our
[09:11.200 --> 09:16.480]  civilization it is going to be an inside job it's going to be something that we
[09:16.480 --> 09:22.240]  personally decide to do in our own lives that will then make ripples out from
[09:22.240 --> 09:28.040]  there expanding okay there's a lot of Middle East news economy news big
[09:28.040 --> 09:33.960]  developments on the radiation front out of Japan what we reported on two months
[09:33.960 --> 09:44.200]  ago is now mainstream news that the federal government has raised to what
[09:44.200 --> 09:50.800]  they claim the safe levels of radiation are here in the United States from
[09:50.800 --> 10:00.000]  Fukushima and there's also some new reports dealing with the situation with
[10:00.000 --> 10:06.840]  the power plant in Nebraska so we're going to be going over all of that today
[10:06.840 --> 10:14.040]  as well and we do have Gerald Salente popping in to join us to talk about the
[10:14.040 --> 10:18.080]  first great war of the 21st century that is beginning to unfold in North
[10:18.080 --> 10:22.960]  Africa the Middle East and Central Asia and we're going to examine what is the
[10:22.960 --> 10:28.320]  real definition of a world war I put a video out last Friday that's had a
[10:28.320 --> 10:35.000]  around 325,000 views it should have 300 million views if the people really
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.280]  understood how much danger we're all in and I'm I got an addendum a special
[10:39.280 --> 10:44.480]  report coming out later today we may even premiere it here on air where I go
[10:44.480 --> 10:51.360]  through and define from different encyclopedias and different dictionaries
[10:51.360 --> 10:58.160]  what geopolitical analysts and historians say a world war is and by
[10:58.160 --> 11:05.720]  every measurement we've been in a world war in the last nine years and George
[11:05.720 --> 11:10.400]  W. Bush did say in ABC News interview and other interviews you can just pull it
[11:10.400 --> 11:16.080]  up George you know President Bush says war on terror is World War 3 and that
[11:16.080 --> 11:22.520]  is exactly how the Pentagon defines it they also defined the 50-year Cold War
[11:22.520 --> 11:32.120]  or right under 50 years from 47 to 1991 as the third world war using proxies the
[11:32.120 --> 11:39.200]  Pentagon and many military history historians call that World War 3 so do
[11:39.200 --> 11:46.040]  you call this then World War 4 and when you look at the war on terror it's a war
[11:46.040 --> 11:51.960]  on our liberties a war on our freedoms for something statistically that is not
[11:51.960 --> 11:57.640]  as dangerous as dying from lightning strikes tornadoes automobile accidents
[11:57.640 --> 12:03.800]  firearms deaths sporting accidents I mean the list goes on and on as I've
[12:03.800 --> 12:07.720]  pointed out many times and gone over the statistics around 150 people in the
[12:07.720 --> 12:14.800]  United States die each year from wasp stings right around 105 it varies but
[12:14.800 --> 12:20.760]  generally over a hundred die from honeybee stings and then several hundred
[12:20.760 --> 12:28.240]  die from spider bites and close to a thousand die from complications from
[12:28.240 --> 12:32.960]  snake bites you can again pull those numbers up online or get it from your
[12:32.960 --> 12:37.120]  World Almanac why then are we talking about giving up all of our liberties and
[12:37.120 --> 12:45.040]  all of our freedoms for the boogeyman of terrorism and there's this idea in in
[12:45.040 --> 12:51.040]  in modern globalist law that they're attempting to basically overwrite
[12:51.040 --> 12:57.960]  European and British and US common law the Bill of Rights the Constitution
[12:57.960 --> 13:03.600]  they're also attempting to even overturn Napoleonic law which is not seen as
[13:03.600 --> 13:09.440]  pro-liberty as English common law but even that is basically being overwritten
[13:09.440 --> 13:14.880]  by this neocolonial maritime administrative law where they describe
[13:14.880 --> 13:20.880]  it as as a maritime and basically say land sea or air they can do whatever they
[13:20.880 --> 13:27.120]  want and just have agencies write up regulations and they are clearly
[13:27.120 --> 13:33.120]  prosecuting a war against the existing order and the existing structure and and
[13:33.120 --> 13:43.200]  it has a thin veneer of nanny statism over it claiming that this is all done
[13:43.200 --> 13:47.840]  for your own good and there's lots of signs about drive safely wear a seat
[13:47.840 --> 13:52.680]  belt we want to take care of you we care about you and that's basically a
[13:52.680 --> 13:56.960]  propaganda that is bought into by the police bought into by the military
[13:56.960 --> 14:00.720]  bought into by the bureaucrats bought into by the general public this is all
[14:00.720 --> 14:05.080]  being done for our own good and so it's kind of a feel-good thing by
[14:05.080 --> 14:09.680]  compartmentalized individuals and the private and public sector to really
[14:09.680 --> 14:13.920]  believe that everything they're doing is for a great good and that's why they
[14:13.920 --> 14:19.160]  have the classic cliche that does absolutely ring true that the road to
[14:19.160 --> 14:26.000]  Hades the road to hell is paved with good intentions and so there's this idea
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.120]  that you must be protected and that's why many suburbs now around the
[14:32.120 --> 14:37.440]  country first license and then ban having a horse in your barn because a horse
[14:37.440 --> 14:42.560]  might throw you and break your back a horse might jump out of its fence and
[14:42.560 --> 14:49.160]  and and and run into a car in fact I've seen what lately cases of cities grow
[14:49.160 --> 14:53.680]  into the rural areas they're saying well you may own this 400 acre ranch but
[14:53.680 --> 14:57.200]  we've now built subdivisions around you you can't have your cows because the
[14:57.200 --> 15:01.960]  cow got out and a car ran into it and because cows might get out of somebody
[15:01.960 --> 15:06.880]  else's ranch or farm in the future we're gonna ban you having cows so it's that
[15:06.880 --> 15:11.880]  idea of prior constraint a terrorist might sneak on this airplane and blow it
[15:11.880 --> 15:18.840]  up therefore you are all treated as if you are guilty until prevent innocent
[15:18.840 --> 15:25.560]  but it's all for your own safety and oh my gosh so somebody got thrown off a
[15:25.560 --> 15:32.480]  horse and broke their neck and so we're going to ban you having horses in the
[15:32.480 --> 15:37.560]  Incorporated County in this town or that town or or oh well I mean you saw it a
[15:37.560 --> 15:42.640]  few months ago with the new law in New York State where they're going to in
[15:42.640 --> 15:48.080]  some cases 150 year old summer camps well established and they're saying you
[15:48.080 --> 15:52.240]  can't have dodgeball you can't have tug-of-war you can't have king of the
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.640]  hill to capture the flag yeah you can't have any of this because somebody might
[15:57.640 --> 16:02.480]  get hurt sorry you can't do it you're gonna have to stay indoors and play
[16:02.480 --> 16:07.160]  chess because somebody might get hurt well you're gonna get hurt you're going
[16:07.160 --> 16:11.480]  to die kids are gonna climb trees and break arms sometimes you're gonna go
[16:11.480 --> 16:16.880]  swimming and you might gulp in some water and pass out and die you're gonna
[16:16.880 --> 16:22.520]  die driving down the highway some of us are gonna die I mean it's gonna happen
[16:22.520 --> 16:28.000]  this idea that everything has to be safe and everything has to be pre-controlled
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.860]  and and that's the idea on speech that's what they've done in Europe they're
[16:31.860 --> 16:35.400]  now doing it the United States Google has put us on notice that owns YouTube
[16:35.400 --> 16:39.600]  they may completely shut the channel down with 117 million views and growing
[16:39.600 --> 16:43.280]  several million a week now it's it's really accelerating and they told us
[16:43.280 --> 16:50.600]  because well what you said about Obama could be construed as racist nothing
[16:50.600 --> 16:55.320]  about his race nothing about race period we just said he was a tyrant and a
[16:55.320 --> 17:00.080]  thug and that they shouldn't try to censor people putting up Obama joker
[17:00.080 --> 17:03.720]  posters that depict him as a criminal whether you love him or hate him it's
[17:03.720 --> 17:09.200]  our first amendment and they said no it's not it's not your first amendment
[17:09.200 --> 17:13.960]  because it might offend someone it might cause someone to get angry you might
[17:13.960 --> 17:19.640]  inflame someone's passions well if you go to a church service it might inflame
[17:19.640 --> 17:23.800]  your passions that in Canada they've banned and have arrested you can look
[17:23.800 --> 17:29.680]  it up many preachers for reading anti-gay passages well whether you love
[17:29.680 --> 17:34.920]  it or hate it or don't care it's their right to do it under free speech but
[17:34.920 --> 17:37.880]  again now there's that prior constraint and the government sending out letters
[17:37.880 --> 17:43.080]  saying you might hurt someone's feelings you can't say this and so it is the end
[17:43.080 --> 17:48.200]  of freedom and it's all sold so we can have this loving utopian system but when
[17:48.200 --> 17:51.480]  you look at the so-called liberals they're not useful idiots they're not
[17:51.480 --> 17:56.720]  morons they're not environmental wackos they know at the top exactly what they're
[17:56.720 --> 17:59.880]  doing when Chris Matthews comes out and says if you don't want government-run
[17:59.880 --> 18:06.000]  healthcare you are a racist you hate black people that was a talking point on
[18:06.000 --> 18:12.160]  CNN and MSNBC for a year over and over again you are a racist you don't like
[18:12.160 --> 18:16.400]  the White House budget going up you are a racist we've played those clips you are
[18:16.400 --> 18:22.720]  one and the message is sit down and shut up and we're going to inject issues of
[18:22.720 --> 18:32.720]  race into everything we're going to actually create racism and division
[18:32.720 --> 18:37.680]  because we need it we need it to divide and conquer you we need it to control
[18:37.680 --> 18:42.720]  you we're going to inject issues and and make it the big national divisive issue
[18:42.720 --> 18:48.280]  over sexual preferences we're going to inject these issues we're going to make

[25:05.600 --> 25:11.680]  report on it the text that will go along with it I would imagine and in fact I
[25:11.680 --> 25:14.640]  meant to talk to him during the break and and give him this good news so he
[25:14.640 --> 25:19.520]  could add it to it and I'll give you that good news here in just a moment
[25:19.520 --> 25:28.160]  dealing with the TSA and the fight being led by Texas and yes Rick Perry had his
[25:28.160 --> 25:35.600]  arm twisted politically by massive pressure by some of the leaders in the
[25:35.600 --> 25:39.920]  House and the Senate and the fact that David Dewhurst has been devastated in
[25:39.920 --> 25:44.240]  the media his heir apparent for the governor ship the lieutenant governor
[25:44.240 --> 25:50.240]  when he got caught sabotaging the legislation when it had almost 100
[25:50.240 --> 25:53.840]  percent of the votes they had unanimous in the House and they only had one
[25:53.840 --> 25:57.920]  person claiming they were going to vote against it in the Senate so they had a
[25:57.920 --> 26:02.880]  near complete unanimous vote and he went in and sabotaged it and told people
[26:02.880 --> 26:08.160]  don't let folks know I'm sabotaging this but another senior senator Dan
[26:08.160 --> 26:13.120]  Patrick who himself has been groped said I'm not putting up with this buddy boy I
[26:13.120 --> 26:17.360]  saw you on the floor with the Justice Department people twisting arms I'm
[26:17.360 --> 26:22.960]  coming out against you you make me sick and we're also working on getting the
[26:22.960 --> 26:28.080]  state rep on who led the fight in the house
[26:28.080 --> 26:33.120]  Simpson and he's been involved
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.760]  in exposing the fact that Perry has been caught lying
[26:37.760 --> 26:41.120]  and he finally called Perry out on the carpet yesterday
[26:41.120 --> 26:45.840]  and so last night Perry announced that he would add it to the special session
[26:45.840 --> 26:49.680]  only the governor could do it but but but not before
[26:49.680 --> 26:53.760]  he got caught lying on video not once but twice
[26:53.760 --> 26:57.360]  that's only part of the special report coming up listen I would love to have a
[26:57.360 --> 27:01.760]  real Texan as president okay I would love to believe in Rick Perry
[27:01.760 --> 27:06.400]  but I can't be conned okay and I've been conned in my life
[27:06.400 --> 27:10.320]  but but but once bitten twice shine I cannot
[27:10.320 --> 27:16.240]  be willfully conned I cannot be willfully ignorant and willfully lie to
[27:16.240 --> 27:21.600]  myself because I have pride in Texas and I'm proud of the good people in my
[27:21.600 --> 27:23.680]  state and their history of fighting tyranny
[27:23.680 --> 27:28.000]  okay you know the frontiersmen of the frontiersmen
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.400]  okay the crème de la crème of truly swashbuckling
[27:34.400 --> 27:40.800]  hardcore people some of them criminals a lot of them serious trailblazers
[27:40.800 --> 27:44.720]  you know this is really where some of the greatest frontier battles went on
[27:44.720 --> 27:48.960]  across the board against the French the British them and the list
[27:48.960 --> 27:54.480]  the list goes on and on Mexico and and I'm proud of the Alamo in the whole
[27:54.480 --> 27:58.320]  nine yards and I'm sick of George Bush giving Texas a bad
[27:58.320 --> 28:00.960]  name and now Rick Perry and I'm telling you
[28:00.960 --> 28:04.560]  he's going to probably be the next president he's going to be a
[28:04.560 --> 28:08.560]  disaster a disaster for this country just like
[28:08.560 --> 28:12.560]  Obama's been and and that's what they need is a
[28:12.560 --> 28:16.160]  gimmick for the public and and Obama was a gimmick
[28:16.160 --> 28:21.600]  literally packaged by Pepsi executives and google executives that's on record
[28:21.600 --> 28:24.880]  with the logoing and he's going to fix everything
[28:24.880 --> 28:27.840]  so they can just sucker you a few more years then you wake up
[28:27.840 --> 28:32.800]  to Obama and he's now as worthless as used toilet paper
[28:32.800 --> 28:37.280]  I mean he he is uncool on campuses the Obama stickers are coming off
[28:37.280 --> 28:40.880]  come on folks couldn't you just listened early on do you have to get totally
[28:40.880 --> 28:44.000]  conned and it's the same thing with Rick Perry

[29:05.760 --> 29:08.880]  Perry adds anti groping bill to special session
[29:08.880 --> 29:13.360]  the whole nation looks at Texas and the bill that rose from the ashes and they

[29:16.400 --> 29:20.640]  demonstration that took over the Capitol but I'm controversial

[32:17.280 --> 32:20.800]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[32:20.800 --> 32:24.400]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[32:24.400 --> 32:28.400]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[32:28.400 --> 32:31.920]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids

[35:02.800 --> 35:08.000]  we know basic liberties are under assault we know that government and big
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.920]  corporations lie even when the truth would serve them
[35:11.920 --> 35:16.720]  because it is their criminal nature and that they have gotten into the positions
[35:16.720 --> 35:22.960]  of power they're in in most cases by engaging in crony capitalism or
[35:22.960 --> 35:27.600]  fascism the opposite of free market and that it's big
[35:27.600 --> 35:30.800]  government teaming up with mega corporations
[35:30.800 --> 35:34.640]  but doing back room deals to shut down
[35:34.640 --> 35:38.240]  their competition so that's really good news some of the other
[35:38.240 --> 35:42.560]  big news for the last three and a half months
[35:42.560 --> 35:46.880]  the new york times the wall street journal the washington post the la
[35:46.880 --> 35:52.720]  times have beaten the drum and gone along
[35:52.720 --> 35:57.680]  with the two plus two equals whatever obama says not four
[35:57.680 --> 36:01.680]  and that this is a kinetic action a peace action
[36:01.680 --> 36:05.360]  and that the bombing of libya the ground troops in libya all of this is
[36:05.360 --> 36:09.120]  freedom and that those of us that are calling
[36:09.120 --> 36:11.760]  in a war and those of us pointing out that obama
[36:11.760 --> 36:16.000]  said we'd be there days not weeks and then those of us pointing out that u.s
[36:16.000 --> 36:20.640]  ground troops were there advising from before the uprising happened
[36:20.640 --> 36:24.160]  and that we pointed out that in egypt and in
[36:24.160 --> 36:32.240]  syria and now in yemen and also in libya that it's now admitted what we
[36:32.240 --> 36:37.120]  said is true that it was u.s british and other
[36:37.120 --> 36:40.960]  nato forces behind the scenes working with al qaeda
[36:40.960 --> 36:46.320]  to start the wars in these countries to then destabilize the entire
[36:46.320 --> 36:50.400]  region and a lot of people you know as this news started to come out said well
[36:50.400 --> 36:53.920]  this doesn't fit with the official narrative that we've
[36:53.920 --> 36:57.680]  got to have tsa literally crushing our genitals
[36:57.680 --> 37:01.520]  because you know a sum of bin laden may be hiding in our underwear
[37:01.520 --> 37:06.880]  it people took a double take and uh bill deberg group we learned from a few
[37:06.880 --> 37:10.080]  months ago at their steering committee at a trilateral commission meeting
[37:10.080 --> 37:14.640]  got very upset that it was starting to come out in mainstream news
[37:14.640 --> 37:18.240]  that al qaeda was the core group in egypt
[37:18.240 --> 37:25.200]  in syria and in libya that the west was working with that destroys their
[37:25.200 --> 37:27.920]  official narrative that we've got to take all your
[37:27.920 --> 37:30.560]  rights and train the boy scouts to spy on mommy and daddy
[37:30.560 --> 37:35.360]  because al qaeda might be hiding in you know a daddy's liquor cabinet
[37:35.360 --> 37:38.320]  or in the medicine cabinet you know because they train the kids this is to
[37:38.320 --> 37:42.160]  fight al qaeda but what's daddy smoking does daddy drink when he drives
[37:42.160 --> 37:47.280]  tell us see oh it's al qaeda but tell me about daddy
[37:47.280 --> 37:51.760]  tell me about daddy's guns this is all on record they have law enforcement the
[37:51.760 --> 37:57.120]  sixth and seventh grade now training uh chances are your public school
[37:57.120 --> 37:59.200]  district has this your government training center
[37:59.200 --> 38:02.400]  and and the sixth seventh and eighth graders the generally sixth and seventh
[38:02.400 --> 38:06.480]  a semester uh they take a law enforcement class and then it's atf
[38:06.480 --> 38:11.680]  funded and the atf known terrorist who burned down churches and cook
[38:11.680 --> 38:17.520]  rider truck bombs uh very nasty folks uh and then ship weapons into
[38:17.520 --> 38:21.120]  mexico to frame the second amendment uh generally most these law enforcement
[38:21.120 --> 38:24.400]  programs having local deputy who's federalized under the
[38:24.400 --> 38:26.960]  bureau of alcohol tobacco farms and explosives
[38:26.960 --> 38:30.240]  and and they come in and actually have the kids write
[38:30.240 --> 38:35.360]  essays about home life isn't that nice and they file them on a computer now
[38:35.360 --> 38:38.640]  and guess who gets that the justice department and the kids are there
[38:38.640 --> 38:42.800]  hiding in plain view parents aren't even noticing this is in my film
[38:42.800 --> 38:46.480]  police state too the takeover now out 11 years ago
[38:46.480 --> 38:49.200]  and we have the school documents where this was going on in uh
[38:49.200 --> 38:53.760]  tennessee and uh georgia and other areas
[38:53.760 --> 38:57.360]  and tennessee expanded where they're writing reports about mommy and daddy
[38:57.360 --> 39:02.320]  as their essays for the law enforcement class with the atf officer at the front
[39:02.320 --> 39:06.080]  and everything is safe and everything is wonderful and everything is good
[39:06.080 --> 39:09.200]  am i saying all the police are bad no to the contrary
[39:09.200 --> 39:13.120]  am i saying that uh everybody that works at the atf for terrorists no but the
[39:13.120 --> 39:16.640]  leadership are uh am i saying that everybody the
[39:16.640 --> 39:20.080]  military is bad no on average military folks are better than the general
[39:20.080 --> 39:23.120]  public in my experiences and their knowledge the fact that they've lived in
[39:23.120 --> 39:25.840]  the real world they're willing to sacrifice something they got in for
[39:25.840 --> 39:28.880]  the right reasons but i'm sorry the people running it
[39:28.880 --> 39:34.160]  are evil and have a very anti-liberty anti-freedom agenda so
[39:34.160 --> 39:36.880]  that's the point i wanted to make before i get to the really good news
[39:36.880 --> 39:40.240]  is that this morning i ran over a curb at my house
[39:40.240 --> 39:42.960]  not paying attention something i've never done
[39:42.960 --> 39:47.360]  uh and scratched my car a little bit then i was driving on the road and my
[39:47.360 --> 39:50.960]  window got chipped uh it was kind of a bad luck day so far but knock on wood
[39:50.960 --> 39:54.160]  it's going to get better and then i got pulled over
[39:54.160 --> 39:57.760]  for no inspection sticker uh because you know i get busy and
[39:57.760 --> 40:01.600]  hadn't got an inspector they've been out a month folks we have such a police
[40:01.600 --> 40:05.120]  state now the police are everywhere trying to generate revenue
[40:05.120 --> 40:09.200]  in this country that years ago i'd forget and go six months without an
[40:09.200 --> 40:12.960]  inspection sticker this thing was out less than a
[40:12.960 --> 40:17.280]  month and i was pulled over by the motorcycle cop
[40:17.280 --> 40:21.680]  and and and here's my issue this guy on his motorcycle
[40:21.680 --> 40:27.120]  was driving down the medium on the highway
[40:27.120 --> 40:33.120]  right by my car just a foot or so which i think risks the officer's life this
[40:33.120 --> 40:36.240]  this is this is reckless this is but they told me to do this
[40:36.240 --> 40:40.640]  he whips around through heavy traffic weaves
[40:40.640 --> 40:43.120]  in the next three minutes i knew he was coming up i said i bet it's the
[40:43.120 --> 40:47.600]  inspection sticker turns his lights on i pull over the point is i watched him
[40:47.600 --> 40:53.040]  risk his life driving erratically but but that's how they all drive you know
[40:53.040 --> 40:56.240]  he's not breaking policy they're told to go out and risk their
[40:56.240 --> 40:59.120]  lives and i'm sitting there with horror watching him
[40:59.120 --> 41:02.560]  weaving through the cars to get up to where i'm at
[41:02.560 --> 41:06.640]  i'd already pulled over in the slow lane so he wouldn't hopefully kill himself
[41:06.640 --> 41:10.400]  uh you know trying to get up on me and then he comes up and i took my children
[41:10.400 --> 41:12.640]  to work today so he comes up looks at the
[41:12.640 --> 41:16.000]  children in the back and i looked in the guy's eyes you know
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.480]  he was a type who you know clearly former military
[41:20.480 --> 41:24.320]  got into being a peace officer because you know it's the job for somebody who's
[41:24.320 --> 41:26.960]  gotten out of the military and he wants to help people
[41:26.960 --> 41:31.200]  and he uh says your inspection sticker's out i said yeah i know i need to get it
[41:31.200 --> 41:34.240]  he said we'll get it i'm giving you a warning and he was nice and you know
[41:34.240 --> 41:38.960]  let me go but the point is that he was risking
[41:38.960 --> 41:41.760]  his life and i'm just all over the map today i don't care
[41:41.760 --> 41:45.280]  because i got here literally at showtime
[41:45.280 --> 41:51.280]  he was risking his life and this goes into so many facets i see police
[41:51.280 --> 41:55.360]  hanging their rear ends out on major highways
[41:55.360 --> 41:59.200]  when they pull somebody over that doesn't know to get all on the shoulder
[41:59.200 --> 42:02.640]  i think that's probably why i usually almost always get let off for speeding
[42:02.640 --> 42:06.000]  or anything is because i actually pull off the road
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.160]  i notice the people that don't always get a ticket but the point is
[42:10.160 --> 42:13.600]  um folks will pull over right on the edge of the shoulder
[42:13.600 --> 42:16.960]  with with cars coming by six inches away and the cop
[42:16.960 --> 42:20.720]  will will stand there with their hind in out in the highway and you know the
[42:20.720 --> 42:23.920]  number one cause of death for police and you can look at the numbers is
[42:23.920 --> 42:29.040]  automobile accident and being hit uh it happens all the time in fact
[42:29.040 --> 42:33.760]  last time i saw the statistics it dwarfed how many cops are killed being shot
[42:33.760 --> 42:37.760]  but they've got cops so scared of being shot so scared of the citizenry
[42:37.760 --> 42:41.920]  but they're not scared to be weaving around through traffic to get up there
[42:41.920 --> 42:45.760]  to that person that has their inspection sticker out
[42:45.760 --> 42:51.600]  now why am i getting at that it's the nanny state
[42:51.600 --> 42:55.200]  and i look you can have arguments foreign against inspection stickers
[42:55.200 --> 42:58.240]  but they started with commercial trucks to quote make sure they were safe
[42:58.240 --> 43:02.160]  and then it's expanded out to everybody and then you've got the mexican drug
[43:02.160 --> 43:05.600]  cartels a more violent war than the vietnam war
[43:05.600 --> 43:09.760]  going on spilling over into my state and it's on record that we have
[43:09.760 --> 43:13.200]  sanctuary cities and the cops just let most illegal aliens go
[43:13.200 --> 43:16.960]  and if they don't they get reprimanded and the judges just let them go
[43:16.960 --> 43:20.320]  so i would have been mad if he wouldn't have let me off i wouldn't have let him
[43:20.320 --> 43:24.080]  know i was mad i would have been irritated in that it's not justice it's
[43:24.080 --> 43:28.640]  not fair it's it's selective enforcement if if i get the
[43:28.640 --> 43:35.040]  inspection sticker uh ticket and you're risking your life
[43:35.040 --> 43:38.080]  to to pull me over to tell me about my inspection sticker
[43:38.080 --> 43:41.840]  but you're not risking your life with the crime wave invasion that's going on
[43:41.840 --> 43:45.120]  because the people that direct you and command you
[43:45.120 --> 43:48.480]  don't have you doing serious business they have you out there
[43:48.480 --> 43:53.920]  revenue collecting revenue generating and no amount of revenue you collect
[43:53.920 --> 43:58.160]  is going to keep you from losing your pension funds because these metrics are
[43:58.160 --> 44:02.400]  set up by the international banking cartels where the money is impossible
[44:02.400 --> 44:04.880]  to pay back okay it's a fraud it's loan
[44:04.880 --> 44:08.480]  sharking we've broken that down with countless economists
[44:08.480 --> 44:12.080]  now i really am ranting here and i need to get to news
[44:12.080 --> 44:16.560]  this is what happens when i get here late and don't get reset before i go live
[44:16.560 --> 44:19.200]  because i prepare before the show at home and then i gotta kind of sit here for
[44:19.200 --> 44:22.560]  10 15 minutes and get ready or i'm all over the map but sometimes folks say
[44:22.560 --> 44:25.920]  that makes for even a better radio show you know i don't read off teleprompters
[44:25.920 --> 44:30.160]  i want to be clear about this i don't go off notes i go off news i've scanned
[44:30.160 --> 44:35.280]  over or or or or covered previously or are gonna cover that day
[44:35.280 --> 44:39.280]  or as news is brought into me i analyze it and go over it but i don't have a
[44:39.280 --> 44:42.000]  teleprompter and that's why you should trust but
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.320]  verify as ronald reagan said i attempt to be honest i attempt to be
[44:46.320 --> 44:49.680]  accurate i attempt to really tell you what i'm
[44:49.680 --> 44:52.880]  really thinking and what i really believe okay
[44:52.880 --> 44:56.560]  but when you talk as much as i do you will make mistakes and all the time i
[44:56.560 --> 44:59.920]  hear rebroadcast in here i flip names or flip numbers
[44:59.920 --> 45:04.320]  i tend to be a little dyslexic yesterday i didn't hear the broadcast when i was
[45:04.320 --> 45:08.160]  jogging this morning and thought about it and remembered that i got something
[45:08.160 --> 45:10.640]  wrong and of course you wouldn't even know i got it
[45:10.640 --> 45:13.440]  wrong because unless you're in my family but i was
[45:13.440 --> 45:15.920]  telling the story about how they're announcing that they're going to try to
[45:15.920 --> 45:20.000]  ban over-the-counter gold sales july 15th and how
[45:20.000 --> 45:23.120]  the major exchanges have made that announcement i had dead on
[45:23.120 --> 45:27.120]  to talk about it and i made the point well my grandmother said her dad
[45:27.120 --> 45:32.560]  in dalis uh who owned the first chevy dealership up there just a little fact
[45:32.560 --> 45:38.720]  toyed uh didn't turn his golden and then after this morning i'm
[45:38.720 --> 45:43.440]  jogging and i go i know full well everything about my great grandfather
[45:43.440 --> 45:48.160]  on my grandmother's on my mother's side he worked at an oil company
[45:48.160 --> 45:52.080]  uh and uh it was a lease hound a bunch of other things
[45:52.080 --> 45:56.320]  and he lived down by bowmont later before going up to dalis
[45:56.320 --> 46:00.560]  and he was and he and he and but see the reason it all merged together
[46:00.560 --> 46:04.400]  was she said he didn't turn his gold in and then
[46:04.400 --> 46:08.640]  it was my grandmother on my mother's side's husband my grandfather on my
[46:08.640 --> 46:11.600]  mother's side whose dad owned the car dealership and i knew that
[46:11.600 --> 46:15.440]  but that's what i'm saying is that i don't have teleprompters here ladies and
[46:15.440 --> 46:18.720]  gentlemen so sometimes when i get moving fast and got a hundred
[46:18.720 --> 46:24.240]  thoughts going on i will say the weird amalgamated things that are
[46:24.240 --> 46:27.280]  truthful but aren't you see what i'm saying
[46:27.280 --> 46:29.840]  because i'm so busy keeping track of everything else everybody
[46:29.840 --> 46:35.360]  else is doing that then it all just becomes a big
[46:35.360 --> 46:40.240]  swamp basically in there okay
[46:42.320 --> 46:46.400]  oh yeah the other positive news i told the folks out there during the break i
[46:46.400 --> 46:51.280]  wanted to show the great success and how the nation's news desk
[46:51.280 --> 46:55.040]  remember that photo many years ago of the white house press corps
[46:55.040 --> 46:58.960]  in their offices and dozens of computers all in the drugs report
[46:58.960 --> 47:02.640]  but i mean it is the nation's news desk and and america leads the news so it's
[47:02.640 --> 47:05.200]  the world's news desk and it is one of the greatest
[47:05.200 --> 47:09.360]  accomplishments we've ever had to have
[47:09.360 --> 47:13.280]  mat drudge running our material carrying our news
[47:13.280 --> 47:16.480]  our information and we have a double drudge link today
[47:16.480 --> 47:19.520]  i just marvel at it we're in the houston chronicle article
[47:19.520 --> 47:23.440]  at the bottom actually giving us the credit but kind of in a backhanded way
[47:23.440 --> 47:27.360]  the chronicle does for leading the way against
[47:27.360 --> 47:33.440]  re re energizing the showdown with the feds who've threatened a economic
[47:33.440 --> 47:38.480]  blockade shutting down all air traffic if the state tries to enforce the law
[47:38.480 --> 47:40.880]  no police officer can stick their hands down your pants
[47:40.880 --> 47:45.520]  without a warrant in an emergency uh are you or total probable cause you just
[47:45.520 --> 47:49.120]  shoved a gun in there uh or drugs or whatever it is
[47:49.120 --> 47:52.240]  so how can they do it well the showdowns here we're going to be talking about
[47:52.240 --> 47:56.560]  that that positive news but also i talked about how
[47:56.560 --> 48:00.480]  youtube has taken all of our honors i don't care about winning
[48:00.480 --> 48:06.160]  a trophy i care because then on dozens of sub pages
[48:06.160 --> 48:08.560]  where most people go to pick what they're gonna watch
[48:08.560 --> 48:12.000]  when you go to when you have those honors when you're number one
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.360]  in news and politics and education and all these other areas
[48:15.360 --> 48:20.880]  when you have that icon then it puts you at the top of all those pages
[48:20.880 --> 48:24.400]  uh and then if they take those icons away you then lose
[48:24.400 --> 48:29.280]  your links to all those pages and and and so the video doesn't go viral
[48:29.280 --> 48:32.320]  uh but but but something strange has happened normally you can't go to the
[48:32.320 --> 48:36.400]  front page when they've been taken away but since we started protesting this
[48:36.400 --> 48:39.440]  our honors came back for about an hour yesterday
[48:39.440 --> 48:42.400]  uh the guy that runs our youtube channel broke that down for me and then went
[48:42.400 --> 48:46.160]  away again but we have three videos on the front page
[48:46.160 --> 48:51.280]  our world war three videos been on the front page and two tarply videos uh
[48:51.280 --> 48:56.160]  the elite's plan for global extermination which i'm so pleased by
[48:56.160 --> 49:02.000]  uh that uh is the number one and number two most viewed videos
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.760]  in education uh and and and just thank god that that uh
[49:07.760 --> 49:12.320]  that report is having such a big effect and uh now getting massive amounts of
[49:12.320 --> 49:16.880]  attention uh by the way tarply well i'm gonna get
[49:16.880 --> 49:19.440]  tarply on about this video because i've seen
[49:19.440 --> 49:24.160]  some of the people that don't have a deep grasp of things historically
[49:24.160 --> 49:27.600]  when he speaks out against darwin and he says one of the chief
[49:27.600 --> 49:34.880]  um philosophers of the british empire they're thinking about the christian
[49:34.880 --> 49:38.960]  atheist argument about is the theory of evolution correct or not
[49:38.960 --> 49:42.960]  when that was only one of his theories tarply
[49:42.960 --> 49:47.040]  uh you know doesn't get into religious stuff tarply believes in the mainline
[49:47.040 --> 49:50.640]  scientific view of things not to put words in his mouth but talking to him
[49:50.640 --> 49:56.160]  he believes in evolution well what tarply is is is talking
[49:56.160 --> 49:59.440]  about but see they show their ignorance they go i'm a scientist and this tarply
[49:59.440 --> 50:03.440]  is an idiot because he says darwin was a chief philosopher
[50:03.440 --> 50:08.240]  they think just a just talking and saying darwin was a eugenicist
[50:08.240 --> 50:13.760]  means that means that tarply is an idiot because any because they're
[50:13.760 --> 50:17.120]  religious see their religion is worshiping darwin and so you don't
[50:17.120 --> 50:21.120]  talk about bad about their god he's talking about social darwinism and the
[50:21.120 --> 50:27.040]  idea of kill the weak in in in the human structure
[50:27.040 --> 50:30.800]  or have a predator class over the suboids the uh
[50:30.800 --> 50:35.280]  morlocks and the eloy you know that wells wrote about
[50:35.280 --> 50:39.440]  so so it's these fake scientific people that that that wear these little hats but
[50:39.440 --> 50:44.000]  are pinheads and have literally no knowledge uh they sit there and then
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.800]  say tarply is an idiot because he's indicting darwin for the eugenics
[50:48.800 --> 50:52.000]  ideas and then they automatically say don't talk
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.120]  about our god you now don't believe in evolution when that's not even what's
[50:55.120 --> 50:59.360]  being debated or discussed in these videos it's about the facts of the

[54:25.520 --> 54:30.080]  the bullies the tyrants are going to have their way with me
[54:30.080 --> 54:34.400]  okay i started getting into the good news and kind of diverted off into
[54:34.400 --> 54:40.240]  hey people are really waking up uh just my radio show is a gauge of that
[54:40.240 --> 54:44.080]  but the positive news and there's a lot of it today but here's one of the big
[54:44.080 --> 54:48.160]  ones i started getting into the fact that earlier
[54:48.160 --> 54:52.720]  that they tried to sell this lie that all these new wars are not wars and are
[54:52.720 --> 54:57.760]  humanitarian and it turns out it's 100 confirmed admitted
[54:57.760 --> 55:01.040]  that the state department the cia british intelligence predominantly has
[55:01.040 --> 55:06.240]  really been uh haunchoing most of it or jockeying most of it
[55:06.240 --> 55:09.280]  captaining it is a good term for the brett's
[55:09.280 --> 55:13.200]  their system has really been pushing it
[55:13.200 --> 55:17.280]  in the middle east north africa and central asia uh to overthrow these
[55:17.280 --> 55:20.560]  countries using rebels they fund they give weapons
[55:20.560 --> 55:23.520]  they have them go out and machine gun cops in military
[55:23.520 --> 55:27.280]  the cops in military go pounce on them and then they go oh my gosh they're
[55:27.280 --> 55:30.880]  brutalizing the innocent people and i'm like well yeah a lot of these
[55:30.880 --> 55:34.880]  countries are thug run but you know the fact is this was all
[55:34.880 --> 55:39.120]  triggered by the west and they're not putting freedom in in
[55:39.120 --> 55:42.400]  egypt and other countries once they topple them they're even taking more
[55:42.400 --> 55:45.920]  rights away and actually putting what our media
[55:45.920 --> 55:50.080]  calls the radical muslims in power the muslim brotherhood al qaeda
[55:50.080 --> 55:52.880]  light on record and you're like well why would
[55:52.880 --> 55:55.120]  they do that well why did they create al qaeda
[55:55.120 --> 55:58.240]  because they're going to end up then having another war
[55:58.240 --> 56:02.880]  in the next few years with those guys this is full spectrum dominance
[56:02.880 --> 56:05.760]  the globalists create all sides of the conflict
[56:05.760 --> 56:09.920]  and then they organize it and come out on top this is very elementary
[56:09.920 --> 56:13.520]  people need to stop thinking of us versus them and start thinking three
[56:13.520 --> 56:17.120]  dimensionally and see the global spider webs
[56:17.120 --> 56:22.080]  of the cortocracy over us and the global standardization
[56:22.080 --> 56:25.440]  and how they're setting this up i mean it's admitted they write countless
[56:25.440 --> 56:29.120]  white papers on it but you you talk to the average you know yuppie who thinks
[56:29.120 --> 56:31.920]  they know it all they're like nobody could run something not complex and i'm
[56:31.920 --> 56:35.120]  like these people are masters of organization and
[56:35.120 --> 56:38.480]  compartmentalization 40 years ago they had cruise missiles they
[56:38.480 --> 56:42.640]  can shoot from a thousand miles away down your chimney
[56:42.640 --> 56:48.400]  and yes they went to the moon and yes yes yes and they come out with all these
[56:48.400 --> 56:52.160]  silly conspiracy theories that can't be proven one way or the other to make
[56:52.160 --> 56:56.960]  people who question look bad but it isn't working anymore
[56:56.960 --> 57:00.080]  the government lies out of hand you're saying well then why do you believe in
[57:00.080 --> 57:02.640]  the moon landing because i have sources inside nasa
[57:02.640 --> 57:06.800]  they put on some fake stuff for you see there was a lie
[57:06.800 --> 57:10.240]  see it's not just did we go or didn't we go you were shown
[57:10.240 --> 57:13.040]  the tinker toy stuff because you're not supposed to see what they really got
[57:13.040 --> 57:16.960]  you're not supposed to know the thousands of astronauts that have died
[57:16.960 --> 57:20.160]  oh yes in fact i should do a whole show on that effect i should this is the kind
[57:20.160 --> 57:22.720]  of stuff we get you killed i shouldn't even get into things i know
[57:22.720 --> 57:26.080]  because i don't have the absolute proof in front of me i just have sources and
[57:26.080 --> 57:30.080]  evidence that backs it up and i'm digressing what's the good news
[57:30.080 --> 57:36.080]  that the hoax that this wasn't a war and that obama isn't a warmonger and that
[57:36.080 --> 57:40.880]  obama is this peacenik nobel prize winner it was all a globalist joke on us
[57:40.880 --> 57:44.480]  to see if they could sell war as peace and it's blown up in their face all over
[57:44.480 --> 57:47.920]  the news the mainstream corporate media tried to sell us this
[57:47.920 --> 57:51.200]  including the washington post and now they're capitulating because no one is
[57:51.200 --> 57:54.480]  buying them and their hoax is falling apart
[57:54.480 --> 57:59.200]  here it is right here obama's negation of hostilities
[57:59.200 --> 58:02.960]  in libya draws criticism the white house is officially declared
[58:02.960 --> 58:06.640]  that what's happening in libya is non-hostilities
[58:06.640 --> 58:11.040]  and then it goes on from there uh to have his own pentagon lawyers being over
[58:11.040 --> 58:14.000]  rule never happened before telling him you got to get congressional approval
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.320]  it is a war and the fact that they go over the fact
[58:16.320 --> 58:19.520]  that the public isn't buying it and the left and the right aren't buying it
[58:19.520 --> 58:22.960]  no one's buying it see this is what carol rove said six years ago the
[58:22.960 --> 58:26.800]  new york times i control reality what we say reality is what it is
[58:26.800 --> 58:30.320]  you report it and if you accept that you're in 1984
[58:30.320 --> 58:33.840]  but what's happening is is more and more people are seeing the emperor is not
[58:33.840 --> 58:37.680]  wearing any clothes he's butt naked he's not wearing a fine cloak

[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:13.440]  of this show saying look pal we know
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.080]  you killed the bill you had your lieutenant governor do it
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.320]  quick claiming you're for the bill when you're really
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.920]  against the bill and he got confronted and got caught lying
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:29.600]  a few days ago uh we're gonna break that down coming up at the bottom of this
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:34.240]  hour but that is very very exciting news as i mentioned at the end of the last
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:39.600]  segment it's very exciting news that
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.400]  obama's negation of hostilities and libya draws criticism
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.080]  and it goes on the fact that the official uh statements of the white house
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:53.120]  have officially declared that what is happening in libya is not
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.560]  hostilities thousands and thousands dead on both sides
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.320]  images of giant you know 10 story buildings being vaporized and exploding
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.120]  into hundreds of thousands of pieces of
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:09.760]  shrapnel uh at least two u.s troops already dead from the
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:14.640]  u.s army according to our sources uh dead contractors
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:19.360]  more u.s special forces on the way and now the media
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.000]  more and more uh is beginning there's a whole bunch of news reports out today
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.920]  saying yes ground troops are being readied uh and of course we also have
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:36.240]  the uh article by kurt nimo marines prepare for massive training
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.880]  exercise
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:46.480]  and the headline is huge marine drill confirms ground invasion of libya
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.080]  and uh kurt nimo's article
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:56.080]  breaks all of that down i'm busy here um
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:00.000]  busy reading the dredge headline because it's a little bit different than ours
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.800]  and that gives me their take on what they see the article
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.240]  covering marines prepare for massive training exercise along beaches
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:12.640]  from florida virginia so we're going to be going over
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:18.800]  uh that report as well today um
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:23.680]  in some of the other news we're going to obviously have that report
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:29.680]  on rick perry coming up that's going to have some breaking information for you
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.720]  at the bottom of the hour so please spread the word about that key
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.320]  information coming up uh but we also have this report by the
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:40.560]  american dream i think is excellent 14 reasons why rick perry would be a

[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:50.480]  and of course the article uh breaks down the fact uh and the subterfuge of rick
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:53.520]  perry it's incredible
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:09:02.000]  it has quotes here uh where senator patrick
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:09.280]  exposes perry for the fact that he sabotages bill a month ago secretly
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:12.960]  and did not want it known quote apparently for political reasons he came
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:16.800]  up with this elaborate political play to kill the bill
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:20.960]  without his fingerprints patrick said speaking to the drama
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:25.280]  over the anti airport pat down bill that failed
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:28.720]  when asked about how that would affect his relationship with doers
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:32.320]  the right hand man of her perry he paused for a while
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:35.600]  before answering the question i have to ask myself patrick said
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:39.280]  before trailing off again and later he said i could not support him for us
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:42.320]  senate or governorship which doers is getting
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:46.320]  lined up for to replace k baby uh or perry either in the center of the
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:50.160]  governorship probably the governorship's the inside baseball he's
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.840]  not sure so we're not sure and then it just goes over the
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:59.840]  fact uh that um that perry was caught lying the
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.760]  houston chronicle joe holly reports that perry told activists
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:07.520]  uh wesley stein strict bind that they simply
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.520]  weren't the votes to pass the measure and they didn't have the votes
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:17.680]  an answer that uh he wasn't pleased with and then a letter was put out by
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.400]  representative david simpson an open letter to him
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:26.160]  documenting the fact that perry is a liar perry
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:29.200]  says on the video we're going to play some of that coming up he says well
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.560]  there's not time to introduce the bill when perry can add weeks anytime he
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.600]  wants a special session when there is plenty of time it's one of the most
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.880]  popular bills and then he says we don't have the votes for it
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.920]  when they have already passed unanimously in the house
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:47.200]  and near unanimously in the senate and uh the uh representatives have reported
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:50.080]  they're probably going to have unanimous votes again they've got close to
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.840]  unanimous already on record saying that they'll vote for it
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.120]  because they try to get the governor to add bills they can have mock votes and
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:01.680]  they've they've had one of those so perry said we don't have time
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:05.600]  i can't put it on and uh we don't have the votes
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:09.600]  and the person was informed and said yes you do have the votes
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.600]  and uh the guy walked away and perry said come here get a picture shake my
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:16.640]  hand you know i'm i'm i'm gonna bend you over a
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:20.160]  barrel here buddy i'm i'm lying to you i'm insulting you
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:25.040]  but that's okay because i know how to talk like a Texan boy
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.200]  and i want me some possum grits and some possum
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:33.440]  stew and i want me some armadillo dumplings
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:37.200]  get granny clamp it out there in the cement pond

[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:49.360]  yosemite sam oh i'll kill oh yeah when here a yosemite sam
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:53.520]  invitation not to get into character to do that
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:59.840]  ruckans ruckan ruckan i mean why not uh i'm convinced that you could dress up
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:02.560]  like yosemite sam in america would elect you because
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:08.880]  there's that archetypal western image of uh you know john wing gonna save you
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:12.800]  and so basically we have a male cheerleader
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:16.880]  who voted for al gore oh he worked for al gore you you didn't know that
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.560]  rick perry but of course you're gonna elect him you love it

[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:37.520]  just like all the idiot liberals did for obama for the establishment candidate
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.800]  you are gonna lick his boots and when sarah pale and him run against each
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.640]  other and have a little cute gaffes that are all scripted oh perry's not gonna
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.800]  like the fact that i have this intelligence
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.120]  info on them uh and oh it'll just like obama and hillary
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:54.240]  then there'll be that secret meeting with the two and she'll come out and
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:13:00.320]  announce that she's gonna be his vp oh yes and we're gonna have rick perry
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:05.040]  his president and vice president cutesy pants right

[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:12.240]  got lined up not mit romney not any of them
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:15.840]  that's at least what rick perry and carl rove thinks they have these fake
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:20.560]  fights between perry and carl rove and oh uh perry doesn't like bush now and uh
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.800]  this stuff is put out to conservatives maybe he doesn't like bush because he
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.560]  he stole the election from his buddy al gore i don't know
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.200]  all right i'm i'm you know when i said i was gonna cover perry later and i'm
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.560]  already getting into it uh but um do you have a special
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:40.960]  announcement about hair perry coming up at uh 33 after here in about 17 minutes
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.880]  so uh there you have it we're gonna be going over all that and starting in the
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.400]  next segment building up to the special report on perry
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:52.400]  i had even forgotten this but when i saw the reports uh
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.560]  it it it refreshed my memory and i went and went to the links and there it was
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:02.320]  admitted did you know perry worked for al gore
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:09.040]  rick perry worked for al gore and he worked for him recently boys and girls
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.720]  let me tell you and he's a male cheerleader oh that he's going to the
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.160]  top there bush was a male cheerleader trend line
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:20.400]  uh bunch of uh if you look at the u.s senate alone
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.680]  last time i looked of the men that are in there
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:28.480]  close to half of them were male cheerleaders now
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.320]  again you got to be a marriage male cheerleader to be in this bohemian grove
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:40.160]  um club male cheerleaders uh so um or or i'm sorry if you're not a male cheerleader
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:43.680]  it's okay as long as you're a male ballet dancer
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:48.800]  like rama manual the chicago mayor i mean i'm that's we're ruled by barney
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:54.320]  frank and and male cheerleaders uh and um
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:58.480]  and and male ballet dancers but it doesn't matter if you're a ballet dancer
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:04.320]  if you wear a cowboy hat you're tough okay wear a cowboy hat with the tights
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.840]  on and the ballet shoes i can just see rick perry in ballet shoes
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.400]  with a cowboy hat on wearing a thong and he's just tiptoeing around
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.840]  you maybe do a los vegas show for chip and ales or something
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:21.840]  uh for the ladies i'm sorry ladies and gentlemen i i'm sorry to talk bad about
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:27.040]  a big al gore supporter like rick perry and you know what rick perry told
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:31.520]  um a fox news source i'll just leave that alone
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:36.000]  behind closed doors he said um there's only three people
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.600]  i'm fearing right now and i'm about to knock one of them out and that was
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.840]  deborah medina because if she'd have beaten for governor obviously that would
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:47.040]  have wrecked his presidential uh you know uh aspirations but he said it's
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:51.440]  ron paul alex jones and deborah medina because what he fears is a true
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:54.720]  constitutionalist that you could call conservative and you know some people
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.960]  see things at their own lens i just want freedom
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:00.000]  yeah i don't want your labels i'm pro gun pro private property
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.040]  i'm anti-abortion if that's conservative whatever but it's not
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.160]  conservative go around warmongering and butcher the bill of rights and
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:10.160]  constitution and sell out to foreign banks and support bailouts like glenn
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:13.600]  beckon mit romney have done mit romney wrote the
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:18.320]  obama care in emassachusetts that was the main model of what we got i mean i can

[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:04.560]  skip this break coming up because uh during my
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:09.360]  catarwalling here we have gotten state representative
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:14.720]  mr simpson on with us and we do have his letter here that he sent
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:19.680]  a couple days ago after one of his constituents got video of rick perry
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.960]  saying that there's not time to reintroduce the anti groping bill
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:27.680]  and that we don't have the votes which clearly uh mr perry had to know
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:31.520]  uh was the case so we're going to be going over that
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:35.200]  here and this is national news one of the top stories
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:39.680]  in the country is this houston chronicle article perry adds anti groping bill
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:43.680]  the special session in this article they have senator patrick exposing
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:48.320]  do-hurst for killing the bill secretly at the behest of uh
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:53.520]  the the uh algore supporter rick perry uh
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.960]  mr cowboy hat so joining us is david simpson
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:00.400]  i'm a representative simpson thank you for coming on with us sir
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:04.320]  thank you for having me alex good to be with you good to have you here now
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:08.320]  now uh for those that haven't heard heard you before tell us who you are
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.880]  tell us about texans against tsa tyranny and and and your quest
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:17.840]  after having your your daughter's grubbed and uh where all this is leading
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:22.000]  i'm a representative from long view uh representing house district seven
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.720]  that's my first year in the state house of representatives
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:31.360]  and uh it's just this has been pretty amazing this is the right message the
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:36.080]  right time uh the people's support for for dignity
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:42.240]  and travel has just been been huge i've just played a
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:46.560]  a role in representing them i'm very grateful for just god's providence and
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:54.000]  bringing all this to pass um uh i'm just it's been like a tsunami
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000]  the support not just from all over texas but actually the nation
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.520]  when the washington times the new york times and drudge took it up as uh
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:08.960]  i began receiving letters from even democrats from all over the country
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:14.160]  one from denver one from massachusetts one from berkeley
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.200]  and you know i've never written a politician before
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:21.440]  i'm a democrat i've never written especially as republican
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:25.920]  this is a tremendously needed bill keep going
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:31.360]  um this is not about partisanship this is about
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:37.360]  a freedom about dignity and travel i mean there is no federal statute
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:41.520]  to that requires uh the groping of people
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:46.400]  uh to travel freely that's just outrageous and this bill just simply
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:51.680]  draws a line uh and saying what is a reasonable search
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.680]  and it's a shame that we even have to do it i'm sorry probably got away from
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:58.720]  your questionnaire you meant to remind me what you asked
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.880]  well no it's just that it it's it's it's outrageous it's over the top
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:07.200]  it's it's in our face that the federal government's out of
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.520]  his jurisdiction it's violating the fourth amendment
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:14.160]  it's violating sexual assault laws a police officer if they randomly
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:18.080]  grabbed a woman or man's crotch they would get jail time anybody would
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:21.200]  how how can they the the feds won't produce
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:25.280]  uh what law or or statute they have to do this i know your office
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.840]  and countless other offices have have done that
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:31.920]  utah is lining up now michigan that's right is lining up
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:37.120]  so i'm so proud of texas leading the way and when you don't first succeed try
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:42.000]  try again our storming of the capital uh like wild hyenas first going to the
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  wrong house we apologize but it doesn't matter
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.520]  them going over to the senate uh you know going to do herst
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:50.800]  office and letting them know that we were aware of what's happening
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:54.720]  the other rallies that have been down there the phone calls the newspapers the
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:57.520]  washington times asking perry to do the right thing
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:00.800]  why do you think i don't want to get into interparty fighting but just to
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:04.800]  have the record clear why do you think it was so hard to get perry to do the
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:08.480]  right thing a b what do you make of him
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:12.480]  claiming because i call a lie i mean he was with the lieutenant governor
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:15.680]  before he knows they had a unanimous vote in the house
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:20.240]  he knows you guys had the votes to say that we don't have the votes
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:24.560]  and then and to say we don't have time as he said in that video interview
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:30.480]  that is outrageous well uh i i couldn't believe he said it either i mean the
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:36.080]  man caught him off guard and perhaps he just misspoke i mean i want to
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:41.120]  think the best of our governor he can take the lead on this issue now it'd be
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:45.520]  huge for him he can do much more than i've ever been able to do
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:49.440]  and uh i'm just so thankful that he put it on the call
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:54.320]  it's a tremendous opportunity to say that we've got a rain in
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:58.080]  out of control uh federal bureaucracy then it's not just
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:02.320]  federal we have state bureaucracies that are out of control as well
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:06.240]  and this is time that we enforce the constitution he's spoken a lot about it
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:11.200]  in his book fed up you know this comes they were fed up with the tsa not just
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.720]  the epa but the tsa there's more statutory
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:18.800]  authority for the epa is doing than what the tsa is doing there's no
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:22.960]  statutory authority for it for the group in the private parts
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:27.200]  and of course the epa reinterpreted the laws with respect to clean air and clean
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:30.880]  water and so i'm so grateful for his fight there and
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:36.560]  the attorney generals but we you know the constitution as jefferson said
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:40.800]  is to be a change that bind down our public officials
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:45.680]  and to keep them from hurting the people and what we have right now is
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:49.680]  that these general laws being made and then these bureaucrats
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:54.320]  just go way and beyond and doing this ridiculous thing
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:58.720]  and we as the public elected officials need to rein them in
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:03.200]  and that's what this law is about representative simpson uh i want to
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:06.800]  talk about how we ensure that other little dirty tricks aren't pulled in
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:12.720]  the senate uh by uh dohurst or uh i'm told uh
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:18.400]  scurrying around uh frankly even worse is uh the democrat uh senator
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:21.280]  kirk watson the former nightmarish mayor
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:27.120]  landgrabber of austin uh the the the the the the don of austin
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:31.040]  how what do we have to look for how are they going to try to kill the
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:35.440]  legislation now how do we ensure the legislation gets passed
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:39.440]  well i you know i'm very thankful for the lieutenant governor
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:43.920]  uh asking for the first one to ask for the people on the call the day before
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:48.400]  the special session then i asked for it and then um
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:53.120]  senator patrick asked for it we have the votes at least we have i i think we
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:56.080]  continue to do we don't take anything to grant
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:59.760]  you're right i mean there are things that are done in closed doors here
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:04.080]  where the press doesn't have access to that they're very disconcerting
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:08.960]  but on the other hand uh we have public statements from these men i take them
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.520]  at their word i'm grateful for their leadership
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:16.160]  but the people just need to know that it is this is just a step forward this is
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:19.120]  not i don't want this to be a period of victory
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:23.200]  uh we have got to hold each one of them accountable
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.040]  and encourage them to support this bill not only in the senate especially in
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:30.480]  the senate but also in the house we do have 112
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:34.160]  uh co-authors in the house and i'm expecting another unanimous
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:37.280]  vote on friday the bill is set for friday in the house
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:40.560]  i was hoping it was earlier but the chairman of calendars assured me that
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.960]  was the best day and i've been in touch with senator patrick
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:49.600]  and i'm hoping that uh people continue to move his bill which is identical
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:54.240]  forward and the senate and hopefully there'll be some co-authors
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.840]  and uh all right people just need the right
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:01.920]  facts and call uh yeah the fight's not over but i want to shift gears in the
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:06.080]  brief time we have and we're very thankful for you coming on sir on short notice
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:09.600]  uh the what the head of the energy commission in texas
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:13.600]  uh and another state rep reportedly fox news i don't know if you've seen that
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:18.000]  yeah that they were in new orleans for those that just joined us i'll recap it
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.840]  and that they held them for 40 minutes and actually crushed his genitals
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:27.360]  to the point of causing serious pain he was sore reportedly for hours
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:30.880]  and and and that's been confirmed that they almost lift you up off the ground
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:34.320]  i have seen them with former minnesota governor jessy vinter when i've flown
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:37.680]  with him actually squeezed his testicles to to make
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:41.600]  sure they're not you know i mean this is i don't normally
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:45.040]  talk like this on radio but we have to describe what's happening
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:49.200]  uh what's your view on them saying we're doing this to punish you i mean
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:54.000]  these people are psychotics well first of all i want to say that i i've also
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.640]  received similar testimony outrageous abuse so there was a man
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:02.560]  from uh i believe it was massachusetts he told it they pressed his testicle
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:06.160]  against his thigh i mean and i'm not just thinking
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.640]  cause a creation and this is terrible pain
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:14.480]  and it's just outrageous that these things are routinely being done
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:18.000]  without probable cause and this is a reasonable measure
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.680]  this is a reasonable place to draw the line it's got to be either here
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:26.160]  or with a body cavity and this is definitely the place that should be
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:30.320]  in utah i think considering not even allowing them to test the body
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:34.320]  but the other issue is we moved this from sexual assault
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.360]  part of the penal code to official oppression
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:40.880]  and that's really what this is i mean
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:45.440]  they had one tsa agent who told a man who had removed his belt
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:48.480]  as he was asked and he was holding his pants
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:52.880]  and she said to him you know hold your hands in there and he told the man i
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:56.640]  said ma'am if i don't hold my pants they're gonna fall to the ground hold
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.640]  hold your hand in there i have power i have power and so he
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:04.240]  put his hands in there and his pants fall to the ground
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:07.840]  this is egregious and this is where the part of the well they rip
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:11.760]  colostomy bags off people that's right
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:14.800]  and this is why it's already an offense
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:20.560]  in the section 3903 of the penal code official oppression
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:25.360]  to impede use an unlawful act to impede someone
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:29.440]  from enjoying a right or privilege as the citizen
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:32.960]  of the united states or the state and and this is just
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.880]  defining it more clearly and it just shouldn't be have to be
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:41.280]  broke in order to travel or to access the public building
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:44.560]  well now sir as you know they've a federal judge rule they should that
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:49.680]  they're going to be at school proms and the tsa is now showing up at malls
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:53.280]  randomly searching people and you can't make this up they actually have the
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:57.520]  boy scouts with them helping spy on people it's like we woke up in an
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:02.000]  alternate dimension that's just outrageous and i've
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.680]  read where they had a contract to make the scanners where they get

[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.080]  on the sidewalk or going into a football game
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:16.240]  you know what we've got to stop and do the real fundamental issues take here
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:19.520]  is the role of the civil government to punish the wrongdoer
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.960]  or is to prevent wrongdoing if it's the matter
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:27.120]  we're going to lose our freedom what we need to do is swift justice when people
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:30.640]  do wrong and otherwise get out of the way and leave them free innocent until

[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:07.680]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:11.440]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:15.040]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:19.280]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:22.480]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:25.120]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:29.040]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:32.560]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:35.680]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:12.640]  okay well we have representative david simpson on and he's trying to be a
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:16.480]  gentleman and be nice but senator dan patrick's a senior senator
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:21.680]  he's on record saying that do her especially at the behest of perry killed
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:25.600]  the whole thing secretly well no kidding they had
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:28.960]  every vote in the senate but one unanimous in the house
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:32.400]  and then they killed it and do her said we didn't have the votes
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:36.000]  we'll see the lieutenant governor can kill bills himself he killed it
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.880]  but then told people i don't want my fingerprints on this
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:42.720]  no kidding because they want to move up and be federal totes they want to play
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:46.880]  ball but we've let rick perry and the whole nation's let rick perry know
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:50.160]  listen buddy we're going to keep your hind in in line
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:53.280]  it's the same thing with obama saying these aren't wars these aren't wars
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:57.280]  for the last three months in libya and other areas
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:01.680]  in yemen and no one's buying it now so the washington post and others
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:06.080]  have gone from saying it's not a war your conspiracy theorist to call it one
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:10.000]  to going obama losing credibility no one buying it
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.040]  so this is the type of exciting things that are happening now
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:18.880]  i've done something a little special that's a gift to rick perry
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:22.160]  to try to get people to actually pay attention
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:27.760]  to his real history and i want to be clear uh... with listeners that
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:31.680]  you can just search the term or we have links to it in the story
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:35.680]  at info wars dot com fourteen reasons why rick perry
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:40.000]  would be a really really bad president and i had forgotten
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.240]  some of the things uh... that are in this article
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:48.240]  like number seven back in eighty eight rick perry supported al gore
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:52.160]  linked to mainstream news for president in fact rick perry actually served as
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:55.920]  al gore's campaign chairman this isn't somebody who
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:00.480]  you know supported al gore accidentally or was low level he was the campaign
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:04.560]  chairman for al gore in the state of texas i mean he
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:08.560]  perry back then was anti-gun pro socialism
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:11.920]  environmental land grabber i mean you might as well
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:18.160]  elect um bill clinton again
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:21.280]  and it it it goes on all the taxes he raised in texas
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.920]  and one of the most sickening things rick perry does is he gets up on the
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:26.800]  news and he says that he's the reason texas
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:32.000]  is doing so good no in spite of you we aren't in as bad as a recession or
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.640]  depression as some other areas of the country
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:40.320]  now we have titled this video rick perry announces presidential run
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:43.920]  and technically he hasn't but in reality he has
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:47.120]  that's why three and a half years ago i said he'd run for president in 2012
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:50.640]  in my film in game because he went to bill deberg he wrote the presidential
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:54.880]  book he's had carl rove in town secretly meeting with him
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:59.520]  and i've seen carl roventown on top of it i know this from his security staff
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:03.280]  i know this from fox news high-level consultant
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:07.200]  i'm not going to say which vice president i have this from a fox news host
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:10.640]  this is over a year ago and it's going to be palan
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:14.400]  now that doesn't mean it's a hundred percent he's going to run that's a
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.600]  hundred percent the system's going to kind of beta test
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:24.160]  palan and perry and others but they believe that that people hate
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:27.040]  obama so much that even though texas has a bad
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.600]  connotation with some americans because of bush
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:33.120]  that america is going to go for it and he gives good speeches he's smart
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:37.120]  so is palan they're going to run against each other then team up with him on the
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:40.400]  top of the ticket that's what the top brains believe
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:44.880]  and i've said that on air for over a year i have on on on record talked about
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:48.240]  this and you're seeing it now remember he pledged he wouldn't run
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:52.480]  but his action show he is running here is the special
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:56.240]  report ladies and gentlemen the special report premiering here
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:59.600]  rick perry announces presidential run because with his actions
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:03.920]  he has he's now broken his pledge he says i i'm rethinking my pledge of course
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:06.800]  he's already running look at all the speeches he's giving
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:10.240]  so so we're just going to announce it for you perry because we already know
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:14.480]  from inside your campaign here it is rick perry's
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:20.480]  actions speak louder than words everything he's done so far tells the
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:24.240]  world i'm running for president and our inside
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:28.080]  sources confirm that's exactly what he's planning to do
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:32.240]  that's right texas governor rick perry has
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:36.480]  announced that he's running for the republican nomination
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:40.800]  for president in 2012 and you're hearing it here first
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:47.600]  at info wars dot com now as the world media tunes in to
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:52.560]  this video they're saying well where else do we have this information
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:58.160]  well you see officially rick perry hasn't announced that he's running for
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.360]  president but in the real world he has and i want to talk
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:07.600]  about that right now almost four years ago i released a
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:11.200]  film called in game blueprint for global enslavement
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:15.120]  where we predicted that rick perry would be running for president
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:20.880]  coming up in 2012 now jim my governor rick perry it's in the front of the
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:25.360]  dallas morning news the headline reads texas governor rick perry
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:29.440]  to attend bill de berg what does it mean to have the governor of texas
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:34.320]  in the dallas morning news just admitting he's going to bill de berg group
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:37.840]  that means he's a potential president officially
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:42.160]  uh bill de berg considers governor rick perry a potential president of the united
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:46.560]  states and he indeed is now positioning himself
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:51.680]  for that you see he told you that he had a pledge that he was not going to run
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:56.720]  for president in 2012 but now he's rethinking
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:01.680]  that pledge to go through all the data is
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:07.040]  mind boggling but bottom line here we have sources
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:11.840]  inside fox news we have sources inside rick perry's security detail
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:16.160]  after all i live here in austin texas been on the radio and tv for
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:21.520]  16 plus years and we've known that for more than a decade
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:27.280]  rick perry has been groomed to run for president by none other than carl rove
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:33.280]  who back in the mid-1990s got him to flip from democrat to republican
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:37.680]  and he was in that same stable as senator graham
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:42.000]  of course later president bush and now governor rick perry
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:47.600]  and so it was carl rove who basically uh put him in the position he is today
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:51.760]  the inside baseball from sources in media texas monthly
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:55.760]  fox news inside the perry camp including people that
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:00.240]  work not just in his security but in his office
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:04.880]  everything from day one has been about rick perry being president
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:09.200]  and now the media is saying he is the front runner
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:13.440]  even when he has not even announced yet
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:18.240]  so rick perry let us know that he had announced for president
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:22.000]  with the establishment with the people that bankroll
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.280]  presidential candidates when he went to bill de berg
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:30.640]  in 2007 and we were on the scene documenting the fact
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:35.440]  that rick perry was basically there uh begging to be the heir apparent and
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:40.320]  that he was chosen the modern political manipulators
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:43.840]  are masters at building up a candidate
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:48.080]  as the answer to all your problems everybody was mad at george w bush
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:54.320]  so here comes barack h obama financed by the very same wall street interest
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:58.400]  we are on record calling it that rick perry
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:03.040]  would be positioned to run for president and now it's happening
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:05.760]  but he plays the part of this reluctant candidate
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:09.360]  oh dear i've put out the presidential book
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:14.320]  of fed up oh dear i'm going to all the big conservative conferences and
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:18.560]  talking about how much i love jesus oh dear i don't want to run
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:22.160]  and then russia limbaugh and all the other big king makers come out and say
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:26.640]  come on perry we're drafting you you've got to do it
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:30.400]  you're the only one that will save us the whole
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:35.920]  thing is a hundred percent scripted so let's look at rick perry's record
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:40.080]  we already talked about the fact that he was a democrat who was flipped
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:46.000]  by carl rove but since then as he rose up through texas politics to the
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.800]  governorship we have seen a extremely duplicitous
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:56.160]  politician in an overall field of lying scallywax
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:04.800]  he is a master manipulator let's fast forward to 2007 the incumbent governor
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:09.040]  travels to bill berg to be vetted by the global elite just as bill clinton the
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:13.280]  obscure arkansas governor traveled there in 1991
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:19.280]  to then be catapulted in 1992 and 93 to the presidency of the united states a
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:23.360]  few years later the obscure even more obscure
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:26.960]  member of parliament tony blair went to bill berg
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:31.040]  bowed down before them pledged to push
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:35.520]  england into the european union he becomes the new
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:38.720]  era parent and has put in his british prime minister
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:43.440]  well rick perry had studied history and his advisers had explained to him that
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:48.320]  bowing down to the globalist was key but first he had to prove himself to them
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:52.080]  he had to hand over the texas power plant infrastructure
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:56.400]  to private offshore consortiums he had to sign over more than 8 000 miles of
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:01.360]  paid for texas roads directly to the private
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:05.520]  spanish company centra and put tolls on those roads
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:10.880]  and when the texas legislature voted by an overwhelming majority
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:14.960]  to stop the trans texas north american union
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:18.880]  highway system rick perry came in and vetoed it
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:24.560]  but that wasn't enough to prove himself he then came out in a giant criminal
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:30.160]  hoax and said all texas school girls must
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:35.280]  take the garter cell vaccine it is the law i am commanding you
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:39.200]  well first off a governor can't do that all he was recommended being on the
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:42.080]  list of recommended vaccines to the state health department
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:45.280]  then it came out that garter cell was a product that
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:48.480]  the big pharma didn't want to put on the market because it was killing girls in
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:52.880]  the trials and so by government mandating it
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:58.240]  vaccine protection laws kicked in that protected the companies from
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:01.600]  liability from the deaths they knew would result
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:07.840]  from this dangerous live virus vaccine being put on the market
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:10.960]  but something else happened in that key year of 2007
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:15.120]  ron paul was announcing his run for the presidency out of texas
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:19.760]  the tea parties formed right here in this state and had huge marches
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:23.760]  rebuking the democrats but also george w bush
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:27.520]  for his tax and spend system and all of his wars
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:31.440]  rick perry in 2008 2009 was being booed
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:34.880]  at republican events suddenly he shifted years
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:39.040]  he said why i kill coyotes in the middle of austin
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:44.400]  while i'm jogging i want texas to secede i'm against the new world order
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:47.840]  down with their world government i'm tough
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:52.880]  i'm gonna deal with corruption all of this was the establishment
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:56.720]  realizing that blue blood rockefeller republicanism
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:01.760]  was dead with the populace so the tea party had rejected him
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:05.360]  the texas legislature had overridden his
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:12.320]  vetoes perry was in deep trouble so he rebranded himself as the ultimate
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:16.400]  super patriot who was going to fight the new world order
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:20.800]  and now he's positioned himself along with sarah palin and others
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:27.280]  to be the presidential candidate who gets the nomination in 2012
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:31.120]  so you heard it here first rick perry is going to announce
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:36.160]  all of his actions have already technically announced that he's running
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:39.840]  for president all the speaking tours the book
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:43.360]  everything he has said and done shows you that he's running
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:49.680]  but from all of our sources fox news host fox news executive people inside the
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:52.880]  perry camp who work with him in the state government
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:56.320]  other inside media sources i have in austin including
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:00.480]  texas monthly have all confirmed that it has always been
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:04.720]  the establishment's plan to put perry in the white house
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:10.480]  as our new imperial emperor and then you have perry don't forget breaking his
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:13.440]  pledge and saying i'll never run for president i'm
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:16.560]  all about texas we may have to have our own country
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:22.960]  and exaggerating his texas accent to now i may break that pledge
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:27.680]  well he proves himself to be a corrupt politician and not a statesman
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:32.160]  again just like bill clinton senator nev sex with that woman or george w
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:36.400]  bush's daddy san read my lips no new taxes or
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:40.720]  obama lying about ending the torture and not hiring lobbyist
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:45.280]  rick perry is like his father the political establishment
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:49.440]  that can be described as nothing less than devilish
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:53.920]  and so at the interest of time i will give you one more example
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:58.720]  that didn't happen a couple years ago but is happening right now
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:03.120]  texas unanimously voted in the house 138 to zero
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:09.680]  to enforce the law and to order the tsa not to sexually grope
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:13.920]  people that are attempting to travel on aircraft
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:17.840]  and he used his minion lieutenant governor
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:21.040]  david dohurst according to senator patrick and others
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:25.600]  to kill that bill in the senate when they had
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:29.360]  every vote in the senate on their side but one
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:33.200]  they could have passed it with a overwhelming majority
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:40.080]  but dohurst killed that bill then we fought for a special session
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:44.080]  the special session was called and i interviewed the different
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:48.160]  members of the state house and they said we just know rick perry
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:52.800]  who's claimed he supports this bill is going to put it on the special session
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:56.560]  only the governor can list the bills on the special session
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:00.160]  and what did rick perry do rick perry waited a few weeks
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:04.240]  as the washington times and lou rockwell and others begged him and said
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:07.920]  you're only hope the nation's looking at you
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:11.680]  what the tsa is doing is wrong it's a federal power grab
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:16.160]  add it to the special session don't make the rumors true that you had your
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:21.600]  minions kill it in the senate and rick perry was silent
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.760]  but finally after he was confronted over and over again
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:29.120]  he publicly lied we're going to play a clip of that in a moment
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:32.240]  and told people at book signings and other events that
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:38.000]  oh i'm sorry uh there's just not time to get it into the session when the
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.040]  governor can expand the session out as long as he wants
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:45.200]  and then he went on to tell a bigger lie he said we don't have the votes
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:51.040]  when they have a near unanimous vote already lined up on record and the bill
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:54.240]  has been tentatively reintroduced he just has to give it a
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:59.120]  silver approval that we're fed up with tsa tyranny if you'd sign that
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:02.640]  so i'm just wondering what your intent is on bringing the tsa legislation in
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:05.920]  the special session they don't have the votes on either
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:10.400]  side that's what i told them i said bring me a multitude of votes
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:14.720]  well senator patricks wrote a letter two days ago indicating that there was
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:18.960]  the votes in the senate it was 112 uh post sponsors in the house
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:22.800]  so in that in view of that in view of that would you consider bringing it up
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:29.120]  in view of that so he's lied publicly he used his
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:34.160]  minions inside on record now the state house to kill it quietly
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:37.680]  and he didn't want his fingerprints on it senator patrick and others
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:42.800]  exposed now he waited to put it on the special session
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:47.280]  as the public pressure mounted he comes out and says i can't there's not time
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:50.560]  and we don't have the votes when they've got the votes with the super
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:53.680]  majority in the house and the senate to pass it
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:57.520]  right now letters have been written by state rep david simpson
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:03.680]  who authored the bill in the house pointing out that now
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:08.400]  the head of the energy commission was flying out of new orleans
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:12.800]  with state reps they pulled them aside grabbed their testicles crushed them
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:16.400]  racking them in pain and they said why are you doing this to punish me
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:19.920]  and they said yeah we're doing this to punish you the feds are so out of
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:23.920]  control they're singling out our texas leaders and our legislators
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:27.520]  and literally torturing them let me put this delicately
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:31.600]  i was still feeling the effects of the pat down
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:36.320]  as i sat in my seat from new orleans to houston and then
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:39.760]  and then houston to austin and rick perry gets up in lies and says we don't
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:43.680]  have the votes when he knows damn all right folks we're gonna come back and
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:47.520]  play the rest of that special report then i'll get

[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  up on info wars dot com rick perry announces presidential run
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  rob jacobson who stayed up all night uh to finish the
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.840]  video wrote a little blur but i've got curt writing a blurb under it
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:42.400]  to explain why we're announcing foreign because we've known
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:45.840]  for a year absolutely that he was going to do it
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:49.440]  texas monthly reports they have sources that confirm he's been getting ready for
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:54.240]  it and plans to and he's doing this whole reluctant hero thing
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:58.320]  and so he's lied to people and said i'm not going to run
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:02.000]  i pledge now he's going to rethink his pledge he was lying
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.240]  when he gave that pledge he didn't rethink it that's the key
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:08.800]  and that's what curt demo is going to add under the video
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:12.320]  he lied he was when he gave that pledge
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:17.200]  three or four months ago and now the headlines perry rethinking pledge
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:20.320]  he did that so rush limbaugh and everybody could beg him
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:24.560]  to then run uh to wet everybody's uh you know appetite
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:29.440]  oh that they dragged the reluctant hero in there so that's why i put this video
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:35.360]  out so that we can expose that fact that rick perry
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:38.880]  has announced for president because he was always intending to
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:42.640]  and when he said i pledged to not run he was lying then
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:46.800]  he didn't just reluctantly then start to change his mind he's a deceiver
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:50.320]  he was al gore's campaign chairman in texas
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:53.920]  he's for the nafta highways the force deadly inoculations
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:56.800]  he covertly used duhurst according to senator
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:00.880]  patrick who said he witnessed it to kill the bill then he wouldn't put it on
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:04.720]  special session then he lied and said he didn't have the votes
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:07.600]  and so that's just because kurt's listening right now i didn't have time
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:11.600]  to direct him during the break kurt's going to add the blurb on there
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:14.800]  that understand we have made this announcement for him
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:18.640]  to expose the fact that he's duplicitous and that he was always intending to
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:24.080]  run and played this game uh that i mean i'm
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:26.320]  basically just giving you in my mind why i did this
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:30.000]  that's the big issue for me uh is that we knew he was running
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.400]  we had it from his security detail fox news exec fox news host
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:38.960]  how it was going to be patlin the whole way this whole thing was planned
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:42.160]  uh more info for more of the security detail
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:46.480]  in in in just the last few days from separate sources
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:51.600]  he's got a big security detail this is an open secret and he's going oh i pledge
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:57.440]  i'm not going to run in 2012 i pledge knowing the whole time he was
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:01.200]  it was it was his plan to run for president back when
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:04.480]  uh
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:07.840]  i almost called him his uh white house name of a turd blossom
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:11.360]  uh well there i did uh carl rove picked him
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:14.320]  george bush and senator phil graham before he was a senator
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:18.560]  picked them you know out of texas politics and put them to where they are
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:21.840]  it's always been his plan he's got the pre-presidential book
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:25.760]  he's got the tour he's he lies and says we don't have the votes
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:29.440]  i mean this is incredible this is incredible he is a deceiver
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:32.880]  and so rick perry's announced for president he's announced by all of his
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:36.160]  actions he always planned to so that's why we gave it that
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:38.960]  headline so it gets the maximum attention so we can expose
[01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:41.760]  who this trojan horse is we're going to go out to break with the end of the
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:45.040]  special report and we'll come back with a third hour with webster tarpley and

[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:56.880]  and the sponsor of the bill says they've got the votes to ram the sucker through
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:01.120]  and they've got all the votes on record he's counting on your ignorance he's
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:07.280]  counting on you to buy into the packaging of a texan and of a patriot
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:10.160]  when all rick perry will do is give texas in america
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:13.600]  a bad name and he'll betray you just like george w bush
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:17.920]  and marocco obama and he'll ensure that somebody like ron paul
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:22.240]  who doesn't have the fancy hair rick perry but as the constitutional's record
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:27.360]  is defeated if you so-called rhino conservatives buy into rick perry you

[02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:31.440]  of gerald salente because the video we posted a couple weeks ago for
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:35.040]  prisonplanet.tv viewers
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:40.240]  the global elites extermination plan for the population i forget the exact
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:43.360]  headline it's the number one and number two videos
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:48.000]  on youtube on their front page in the education section
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:51.360]  and you know it's not enough to get a few hundred thousand views this video
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:55.680]  needs to have millions of views exposing the eugenicist
[02:00:55.680 --> 02:01:00.480]  system and tarpley made a few points in the video
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:05.280]  and and it's getting overwhelming you know positive votes
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:09.920]  people can vote dislike or like but some people don't understand when tarpley
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:12.720]  talks about darwin whether you believe in evolution or not that's not what
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:17.920]  tarpley's talking about tarpley is talking about the
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:22.160]  fact that darwin was also a malthusian who talked about getting rid of
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:25.040]  populations so his view was we're doing people a
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:29.040]  favor to kill them that's what social darwinism grew out of and that is the
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:32.880]  main driving philosophy if you had to pick one
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:37.120]  behind the global elite and their rationale and what they're obsessed with
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:41.200]  and a modern priest in the system is john p holdren
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:45.200]  so i'll recap that and bring tarpley up uh in the next segment
[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:49.040]  right now uh i'm going to uh actually pull
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:52.240]  up for myself there it is the elites plan for global

[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:21.680]  what a monster john p holdren is but then i see some people
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:24.160]  when he's quoting from holdren's book about forced
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:29.360]  fantaside abortion sterilization cutting off resources
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:32.080]  getting rid of two-thirds of the world's population or more

[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:38.560]  scientist and there are too many people and tarply
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:43.920]  says he doesn't like darwin well he's a kook again it's not even about a
[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:47.760]  debate dealing with evolution the debate
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:52.400]  is dealing with darwin's main beliefs and they show their ignorance when
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:55.440]  trying to claim they're smarter than tarply but i've researched all this stuff

[02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:27.600]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:31.520]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:34.640]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:38.560]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:40.640]  of emergency dictatorship body scammers sound cameras
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:44.720]  citizen spies stage terror and cameras on every street corner
[02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:48.240]  it's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan

[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:17.680]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:23.680]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:27.040]  we've got top trends forecaster gerald selente
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:30.560]  dealing with what he predicted a year ago the first great war of the 21st
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:33.840]  century all the world war three world war four by any
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:38.960]  gauge now it's leading into a world war people tend to think a third world war
[02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:42.640]  uh as thermal nuclear in the russian connotation
[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:46.720]  uh with the einstein quote about i don't know uh what's going to happen with
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:49.520]  world war three but i know world war four will be fought with sticks and
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:53.520]  stones so we'll get his take on that in the next little short segment ahead of
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:56.480]  gerald selente but i wanted to get doctor of history
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:09:00.960]  he's also an economist tarpley on dr webster tarpley
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:05.520]  because a few months ago we went to dc we do this for prism planet dot tv
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:10.160]  folks we went to dc and shot an hour with him
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:14.640]  uh of many hours of interviews just on john p holdren's book
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:18.560]  and other government documents where they openly say planetary regime global
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:21.040]  extermination i've now got the fact that they're
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:23.600]  developing airborne ebola that's another report
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:26.320]  that uh we're going to be getting too later better get to it now they're going
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:31.360]  to send a hit team over here but the the issue this is dangerous stuff
[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:36.480]  folks the issue here uh is that i i wanted to have
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:41.600]  tarpley school some people in this live radio slash tv transmission
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:46.160]  so i can then put a link up on uh the elites plan for global extermination
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:50.240]  exposed by dr webster tarpley so i can put it as an
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:58.720]  addendum video for the softest uh the kooks uh the uh the so-called scientific
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:02.480]  cultist because they'll say i'm a scientist you're not you're an idiot
[02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:05.440]  and you see these guys want to be scientists or people that have a
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:09.040]  you know biology degree or whatever we've interviewed hundreds of scientists
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:14.560]  exposing the global exterminism program and they say tarpley is you know evil
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:18.560]  tarpley is a liar how dare him say that that darwin was bad
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:22.480]  when i don't even particularly know tarpley's view on darwinism creationism
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:25.440]  um i don't know him to even get into religious stuff
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:30.400]  the point is darwin was a neo mouthist or malthusian
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:34.320]  and in his writings and that grew into social darwinism which is the main
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:38.640]  driving religion of the global elite that it's their right to kill us steal
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:41.520]  from us enslave us because it's their right to dominate
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:45.440]  well that's a predatory system turned against we the people
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:49.760]  yes humans are predators but mainly builders and explorers and we look
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:52.240]  outward we don't feed on our own people
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:56.480]  that is an aberrant uh development as civilizations got bigger
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:11:02.160]  uh and that gets into sociology anthropology uh archaeology but but
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:05.360]  the point is i've studied all of this and and i know what tarpley's talking
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:09.760]  about when he gives a gestalt of you know look at who go look at who
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:13.520]  john p holder in the white house science are likes and he mentions the three
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:17.680]  big proto eugenesis coming out of the mouth of school
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:21.760]  and and and he calls himself a neo malthusian and so tarpley
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:26.080]  talks about darwin and these scientists uh and and want to be scientists the
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:30.720]  star trek type fan people you know who is a particular cult
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:34.240]  they then scream and say don't talk about our god
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:39.040]  darwin so i thought i'd get tarpley to briefly explain what he's saying about
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:42.880]  darwin and why he criticized darwin because here's this book here's all
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:44.800]  these documents here's all these state department
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:48.640]  memorandums here's tarpley giving total proof of everything he's saying
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:53.120]  and this minority of people are throwing fits and savaging him and saying
[02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:56.960]  there are too many people and by the way how dare you talk about about darwin
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:00.400]  when we're not even debating one way or the other that's a tar baby
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:04.800]  uh uh the theory of evolution the point is it's on record that the theory of
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:08.400]  evolution was developed hundreds of years earlier in italy other areas under
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:11.520]  other names again he was just a little you know royalish
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:16.000]  family that they picked uh to to to popularize it so they're also
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.840]  plagiarist and then that's on record the darwin was again a softest
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:24.320]  plagiarist so so that's the issue look at the issue at hand so they're a bunch
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:28.640]  of neo-malthusians mad at dr tarpley for devastatingly
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:32.960]  savaging them and dr tarpley video is number one in education
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:36.480]  on the front page of youtube right now it's at the alec jones channel they're
[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:40.960]  trying to shut down right now with red tape and violation saying we're racist
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:43.280]  for not letting obama we've actually been told this
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:46.240]  and given a violation so we may be shut down any minute we're told if we
[02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:48.400]  challenge it they may completely shut us down
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:51.680]  so that uh it's just incredible what's happening
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:56.720]  but dr tarpley uh they're coming after you for that and they're also saying
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:00.720]  when you say the current ecosystem would collapse without humans
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:03.600]  they don't know about all the major studies that humans have changed the
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:06.720]  ecosystem and that much of the ecosystem we now have
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:10.240]  is dependent on humans and then in many cases humans actually better their
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:12.720]  environment they don't know your great
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:15.840]  knowledge that i've separately researched when you give a gestalt
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:19.120]  statement they say that that is a ridiculous fraud and that we would be
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:23.360]  better without humans being here better without humans
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:28.400]  we are humans it's this it's this white flag running it up saying humanity's
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:31.680]  bad deciding we're scum deciding we're trashed to
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:35.040]  be taken out and they as they attack you they show
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:39.280]  what neo-nazis they are so brainwashed and controlled dr tarpley
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:43.840]  they don't even know they're nazis well i i would call a lot of these people
[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:47.280]  quack academics in other words they're academics but they're
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:50.640]  charlatans and and no matter how many degrees they have
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:54.800]  they remain charlatans uh what you see of course
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:59.920]  through the the uh between the lines of their work is a profound hatred
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:05.600]  for humanity and i'm afraid they will to genocide and this is now genocide
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:09.360]  on a planetary scale it goes beyond the genocide
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:13.120]  in uh in these are jibbering demonic control freaks
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:16.080]  uh who have not been accepted in life because they are
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:20.320]  malfunctioning disgusting torps and so they turn that inner frustration
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:24.640]  outwards looking for power and to kill well and some of them of course have
[02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:28.480]  gotten very high like john aldrin has now become the the white house
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:33.680]  science advisor this is a this is a mockery and the travesty beyond belief
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:37.840]  but what they're singing essentially is the eternal song of the oligarch the
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:42.320]  oligarch has always got to justify why should
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:46.000]  certain selected families or financiers
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:49.520]  rule the world what is it about them are they more competent or
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:53.360]  whatever it is and they've always got to invent some kind of an etiology
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:57.520]  to say the vast mass of humanity is inferior
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:15:01.680]  subhuman and does not deserve to live and their basic idea is
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:04.800]  you pollute your threat to the polar bears
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:08.400]  your threat to the snail daughters to the storks to the penguins
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:12.720]  and all the rest of it and therefore you have to be exterminated and this is a
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:19.040]  profound contempt for concrete human individuals the vast majority
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:23.040]  thereof now in terms of the theory mouth first is without
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:26.400]  doubt the biggest crackpot and also one of the most
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:32.720]  evil influences in the 19th century remember that mouth first is a plagiarist
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:36.160]  he plagiarizes from the work of John Maria Ortiz
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:40.720]  or t e s if you look on tarply.net you can see
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:44.640]  an essay i did about this at the time i believe of the real conference
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:48.960]  back in uh back in the mid 90s uh he's a plagiarist
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:52.480]  that you actually have been to many of the un conferences you've actually
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:56.560]  worked in Rome you've actually traveled the world you've actually read the books
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:00.560]  you're not just somebody that says oh i'm a scientist tarply's a cook
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:04.400]  i was i had the honor of being thrown out of the Rome
[02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:08.080]  uh international food conference the united nations world food conference
[02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:13.120]  held at Rome in november of 1974 by the food and agriculture organization
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:17.040]  they threw me out of their conference because they said that i was asking
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:20.240]  questions well these are people looking for an excuse to kill
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:22.880]  so they can have everything for themselves the classic
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:26.320]  mode of tyrants but but getting back what's your view of darwin because
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:33.280]  you criticize darwin for his neo uh uh you promotion at the mouth mouth first
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:38.000]  essentially darwin exists within the framework established by
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.000]  by mouth first now that the problem with darwin the the main problem and then we
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.720]  can talk about some of the more politically obvious ones
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:48.240]  the big weakness of darwin is the so-called blind
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:51.120]  watchmaker and he expresses this by saying
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:54.400]  when god created the universe if he ever did
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:58.000]  then he did it as a blind watchmaker in other words
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:01.600]  he didn't know what he was doing and what he's what he's trying to express is
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:06.880]  the idea that evolution is purely random now we have to
[02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:11.680]  distinguish evolution in my view is absolutely true
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:15.600]  there is evolution there's tons of evidence for evolution right the
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:18.240]  fossil record the geological record on and on
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:21.280]  historical evolution also comes into play but
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:26.160]  darwin is a whole different kettle of fish divide the question of evolution
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:30.560]  from the question of the charlatan darwin and darwin comes in and says
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:35.440]  the universe is fundamentally indifferent to development if the universe
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:38.480]  doesn't care whether there's development or not
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:42.880]  and everything that happens in the universe is purely random
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:46.800]  purely by chance and i would say and many others have said
[02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:51.360]  this is impossible because there is no random process that leads to the
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:57.200]  development of an eye or other forms of of positive evolution
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:00.880]  and i'm not arguing anything supernatural nor am i arguing anything
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:04.080]  that depends on religion per se i'm simply saying
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:07.920]  that when you look empirically at the universe you'll see
[02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:12.400]  that there is a built-in tendency towards development
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:16.320]  that we go from lower levels of energy and organization
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:20.480]  to higher levels of energy and organization in other words
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:24.960]  the universe is not entropic as darwin or others might think
[02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:30.640]  but rather the uh opposite i guess my point is is that i knew that you
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:35.200]  weren't even debating uh uh you were stating that darwin
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:40.000]  had these malthusian views and was anti-human anti-development and very
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:43.680]  nasty and was one of their big excuses for what they do
[02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:47.280]  and these weak-minded people run off down the road
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:50.240]  and don't even debate you on what you really said
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:55.200]  they build this sophistic straw man with which to attack you and they're just
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:59.280]  so intellectually shallow while they wriggle around talking about how smart
[02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:02.640]  they are all day yeah again my argument is the universe is
[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:07.200]  negentropic the universe tends towards higher levels of energy higher levels
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:11.280]  of organization it is not the watch that runs down right
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:14.800]  newton newton is in the same tradition newton says it's a watch that will run
[02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:18.640]  down unless you rewind it no and darwin's the school of
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:24.160]  entropy sure but but but einstein agreed with you he said uh you know
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:27.840]  that god uh you know you know does not play dice
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:31.840]  and now more and more genetic engineers quantum mechanics who were atheists
[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:35.120]  they they start looking into this stuff they go this is designed
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:39.520]  there is order here with order building this is not the award design is a
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:42.800]  little bit charged i would simply say there's a built-in bias towards
[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:45.440]  development the built-in tendency towards development
[02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:50.720]  that is what you see empirically and garwin attacks that it's just an

[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:10.320]  I hear the talk to Tarpley all day and the other thing that
[02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:13.920]  they're attacking him on the video for is saying that the
[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:18.800]  current ecosystem would collapse if humans weren't here
[02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:21.920]  he talks about the human-made ecosystem and we have more
[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:24.480]  forests than we had in North America 200 years ago that's
[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:27.840]  confirmed uh many areas where humans are actually it's where
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:31.200]  the wildlife comes into but these ignoramuses don't know about all
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:33.680]  those studies sure there are things humans do that are bad for
[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:36.240]  the earth but the earth was born out of fire it's very
[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:39.920]  powerful uh and and the ecosystems are incredibly
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:42.880]  powerful i am worried about some of the cross species genetic
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:45.280]  engineering and things like that that can you infect the
[02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:48.240]  biosphere but the environmentalists aren't they just want to use
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:52.000]  environmentalism as excuse to say we vote for the cockroaches and
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.720]  the cockroaches out vote you were taking your property that
[02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:58.880]  boils it down to tarpley am i correct in what you said in that
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:02.480]  a gestalt statement about you know the current human design ecosystem
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:06.160]  would collapse and you're just saying the current ecosystem
[02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:10.080]  you're saying that humans have made contributions not just things that are
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:13.120]  negative correct above all uh agriculture right if you look at
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:16.720]  agriculture uh all over the world this is this whether you like it or not and
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:19.600]  whether it's been done well or poorly or in between
[02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:22.880]  agriculture is now an integral part of the world
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:26.480]  ecosystem and a human activity in general
[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:29.840]  plays a role which can be negative but it's also positive and
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:33.200]  the point with these fanatics is that their hatred of humanity their
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:36.800]  genocidal fury is such that they can't imagine
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:40.800]  a positive role right they say humanity is the cancer of the earth
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:45.440]  mankind is a disease has to be exterminated uh don't have children
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:49.040]  uh this is simply the language of hate now historically that's also but it's
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:53.440]  been if you look at Darwin right this idea of the struggle for existence
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:57.680]  this leads you directly to Friedrich Nietzsche and the will to power
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:00.160]  Nietzsche says basically i'm going to go you
[02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:03.840]  one better Darwin i'm going to get to the will of will to power
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:07.520]  and that takes you straight to Hitler so in other words the roots of genocide
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:11.120]  are in this on the other side social Darwinism
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:15.440]  the application of Darwin to sociology and social theory
[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:21.040]  an absolute disaster because this leads to the most reactionary the most brutal
[02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:26.880]  the most cruel backwards savage kinds of social policies right that the poor
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:30.480]  should die because it's their fault they failed
[02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:35.280]  it's or the idea for example that war is a good thing because it wipes out the
[02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:39.680]  weaker members of the human well this is what it does this is what it does
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:43.440]  and correct me if you disagree with this but but i mean it's just an innate
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:48.720]  instinct i know it to be human is to reach to build to recognize beauty
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:52.080]  and to want to construct and trailblaze and explore
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:56.880]  certainly we have the barbarous side to us that is part of our overall balance
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:00.640]  but if you just say the barbarism the brute
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:04.560]  you know anarchy is what humanity is and dive into it
[02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:08.560]  every civilization that does that degenerates those that reach for the
[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:14.160]  stars build palaces of enlightenment correct in
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:17.600]  in other words i would the way i would say it is that mankind is
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:21.120]  potentially good and the true aspect of humanity is
[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:25.040]  scientific creativity and other forms of creativity
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:28.560]  and this is exactly what Darwin never never takes into account you notice
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:31.680]  these people never talk about technology
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:36.560]  they say the array of resources that mankind can draw in is
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:41.360]  axiomatically fixed it's always the same and notice they control the resources
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:44.000]  they're just creating a paradigm of artificial scarcity
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.960]  what happens if we come along with a new discovery
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:50.800]  a new technology that allows us to define a whole new array
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:54.000]  of resources or parts of the material universe
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.200]  as resources right if we can instead of having uranium
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:01.040]  if we could use seawater as a fuel or sand as a fuel
[02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:05.360]  or anything else as a fuel that would be a step forward and this is
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:08.640]  exactly what they never want and it leads them to these ridiculous
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:12.240]  consequences they did this book about the limits to growth
[02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:17.200]  in the early 1970s and they calculated that world society would break down
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:20.320]  within 20 to 25 years because of the exhaustion
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:24.000]  of natural resources well it hasn't happened and what has happened
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:28.080]  is that in many of those categories we now have more proven reserves
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:33.040]  than we did then job media artist back in the 1790s
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:36.240]  said that the carrying capacity of the world
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:39.920]  was three billion that was the absolute upper limit
[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:43.600]  and now we have charlatans today academics who come back with the
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:47.760]  carrying capacity well the carrying capacity changes
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:52.160]  when technology changes and science gives exactly but but at the end of the
[02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:54.960]  day that the the the useful idiots believe all this
[02:28:54.960 --> 02:28:59.120]  the technocrats know they're just selling a collective guilt so we'll give
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:03.760]  into their fake green tyranny that isn't green at all to let
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:07.040]  them organize our society and now they're selling
[02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:10.160]  everywhere the end of humanity the world without humans
[02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:14.400]  all these tv shows and books how sexy it is how great it is to die
[02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:18.560]  they're giving us a collective will to commit societal suicide
[02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:21.200]  so that the globalists can have it all for themselves
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:24.880]  they have injected a psychic fail switch into us
[02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:30.160]  to to flip off our life force uh survival mechanism and i
[02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:34.480]  am an organic response like a piranha white blood cell against them

[02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:07.840]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:31:07.840 --> 02:31:11.760]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:15.200]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:31:15.200 --> 02:31:18.080]  it's true total government control of electricity
[02:31:18.080 --> 02:31:21.600]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:25.200]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:29.120]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:31:29.120 --> 02:31:32.640]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:31:32.640 --> 02:31:35.760]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:31:35.760 --> 02:31:38.880]  onages number five a solar power generator provides

[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:45.760]  washington post had to run the headline today
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:49.680]  obama's negation of hostilities and libya draws criticism
[02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:52.960]  the white house has officially declared that what's happening in libya is not
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:57.200]  hostilities that's like if i say i'm god and i walk
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:36:59.600]  up and shoot you five times in the ad and say
[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:01.920]  bobbin dead on the ground with his head blown off
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:04.880]  meanwhile you're on the ground your the whole top of your head's blown off
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:08.560]  you're dead there's a big pool of blood and i say he's not dead
[02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:13.760]  this isn't war it's kinetic and it turns out top military
[02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:17.760]  uh advisors the top pentagon lawyers and by the way
[02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:21.280]  they're now reporting throughout the week even the new york times says
[02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:24.480]  the president's never gone against these lawyers the lawyers have said it's
[02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:27.200]  illegal you got to get congressional approval
[02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:30.720]  it's a war you're making a fool out of yourself saying it's not a war
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:35.280]  mr peace prize winner and they said eh let them eat cake
[02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:38.880]  and so that's now happening but the good news is just a month ago the washington
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:43.200]  post and others were agreeing it wasn't a war they tried to sell us this manure
[02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:47.040]  and tell us that it was chocolate brownies people didn't even take a bite they
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:50.880]  smelled it and said we know what that is so the point is they're losing even more
[02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:54.720]  credibility because their lies have gotten more brazen
[02:37:54.720 --> 02:37:58.560]  meanwhile nato loses contact with one of their drone shoppers it's so cowardly
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:01.120]  they don't even have your troops and the helicopters
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:04.000]  huge marine drill confirms ground invasion of libya that's linked on
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:08.880]  drudgereport.com uh from info wars.com curt nemo's report
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:12.400]  kinetic military action of war libyans are still dead
[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:16.080]  uh u n exploits libyan refugees calls for taxing risk nations
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:21.200]  another scam uh that's just some of the news we have but to break it down
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:24.240]  what he said a year ago he said it's going to be war
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:27.680]  when the economy implodes when europe starts going down
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:31.360]  and he listed the countries in the order we all thought it would be
[02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:34.640]  portugal next but now it's idly imploding but that that was after
[02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:38.240]  portugal the point is it's on the chinese are
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:42.720]  accelerating their dumping of t-bills f t headline financial times
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:48.240]  trades revealed china shifts from dollar uh joining us via video skype is gerald

[02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:13.760]  and hadn't had any sleep so i'm sorry i was like a zombie
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:17.600]  no no it's a great night it was a fun to get together with everyone
[02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:20.880]  it was awesome uh now that we've dispensed with the more enjoyable
[02:39:20.880 --> 02:39:24.560]  pleasantries uh you've you've really called it
[02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:27.520]  accurately so so so tell us what's going to unravel
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:31.360]  with this great world war that they're calling peace
[02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:35.520]  well we're going to look we have to look at now is what's going on
[02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:39.040]  in in europe particularly with greece and spain
[02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:42.000]  the people are taking to the streets they know the deal
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:45.360]  that there's not there's no change at the ballot box
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:48.880]  if you go to the ballot box there's a jack in the box in there just another
[02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:52.640]  political clown so they're demanding real change
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:56.240]  they can believe in so there's no outs in this
[02:39:56.240 --> 02:39:59.680]  for example you pick up the news and you see
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:03.360]  one day greece is going to be bailed out the next day they're not
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:09.440]  greece is only a small player with this and what is the bailout the bailout
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:12.480]  means you have a second mortgage now they're going to give you a third
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:17.280]  mortgage and the imf is coming in to oversee the deal
[02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:20.720]  all the imf is it's the international
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:26.880]  mafia federation they're the loan sharks of last resort
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:31.760]  you need the money you go to the loan shark but you know they're respectable
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:34.480]  you know they have three names in their name like
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:38.560]  dominique straws con you know and they loan you the money
[02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:42.560]  that they got from you in the bailout that they that's a that's a beautiful
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:45.600]  system oh it is and here's the deal
[02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:50.000]  where they tell you go tax the people i want the money
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.960]  you tax the people you don't bring in enough money
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:58.080]  then they come up with another line they say we have to privatize
[02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:04.720]  privatize i want your bridge i want your your water supply
[02:41:04.720 --> 02:41:09.360]  i want your toll road garbage that's all it is
[02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:13.200]  it's a mafia they're shaking down these countries
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:16.960]  and by the way people should understand that's what happened in
[02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:20.880]  egypt that set it up for what happened now
[02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:26.240]  they sold the country out under quote privatization which means
[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:32.560]  taking valuable public resources and selling them to your criminal buddies
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:37.520]  for pennies on the dollar so now it's imploding worldwide
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:43.920]  as i said a year ago follow the timeline the crash of 29
[02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:51.440]  the great depression currency wars trade wars real wars the panic of 08
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:59.040]  the great recessions last depression currency wars trade wars real wars
[02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:02.800]  we heard public enemy number one today
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:09.680]  Osama bin Bernanke say he's considering more stimulus of course
[02:42:09.680 --> 02:42:16.800]  great devalue the dollar more drive the people deeper into the ground
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:22.240]  make them pay more for everything because the banks need the money they
[02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:26.880]  have to keep the Ponzi scheme going that's what stimulus is
[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:30.880]  keeping the Ponzi scheme going but it's all collapsing
[02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:35.440]  and as i said when it all collapsed they take you to war
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:38.400]  did you see the quote i reread it yesterday
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:43.120]  a few months ago with the liberty dollar that been operating for 13 years
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:46.720]  corning their own silver and gold even ap admitted that's totally legal
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:50.640]  there's hundreds of companies that do it but because he criticized the
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:54.400]  federal reserve they arrested him had the federal jury who convict
[02:42:54.400 --> 02:42:58.400]  people 98 percent of the time that shows how how how
[02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:03.520]  fake they are convict him and then and then the u.s attorney
[02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:07.280]  on the fbi website said these people are terrorist
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:11.040]  we're going to get anybody that's got gold and silver anybody that tries to
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:15.680]  undermine our financial system here they are the the foreign banks have
[02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:18.320]  done this the goldman sacks have done this
[02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:23.040]  they're wrecking us and then they're now blaming us a company with gold and
[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:26.320]  silver coins that never pretended to be government
[02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:30.560]  gold and silver publicly criticizing it saying have alternative currencies
[02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:33.360]  we got a whole bunch of states moving to do the same thing
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:36.800]  and they're saying your terrorists were coming after you and now
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:40.400]  the forex came out and said that the way they interpret the new laws
[02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:44.800]  that by july 15th private sale of gold and silver will be illegal
[02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:48.240]  and the word is now the feds are talking about trying to confiscate
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:51.360]  i mean these people and i guess america will line up
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:55.040]  and say because that's what happened in 1933
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:58.720]  okay here's our golden silver give us the valued paperback
[02:43:58.720 --> 02:44:01.760]  and we'll line up and the cops will have machine guns and we'll just give it to
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:03.760]  them and and then they'll publicly ship it to
[02:44:03.760 --> 02:44:08.640]  goldman sacks and and bank of america like they did in 19th
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:13.520]  33 i mean i mean there's i can't believe the stuff they're doing jerald
[02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:16.800]  well again it was all predicted all foreseeable
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:19.920]  it's the biggest bank robbery in world history
[02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:24.560]  and the banks are doing the robbing and the only way this is going to change
[02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:30.000]  is to bring down the banks and by the way i am f is actually a verb
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:35.520]  like i am f or i am f'd up by doing business with them
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:42.160]  that's all it is it's one big international mafia federation
[02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:48.720]  they are robbing us in broad daylight and the people are taking it and that's
[02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:52.320]  what really discourages me the most because they're
[02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:56.400]  still looking for a political solution
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:02.880]  is no such thing it's an oxymoron there's no political solutions
[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:07.920]  very well said jerald and but but there are some good signs i mean obama says
[02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:11.120]  these aren't wars the mainstream media tries to play along
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:15.520]  with the emperor is wearing a beautiful outfit and enough of us stood up like the
[02:45:15.520 --> 02:45:17.920]  little kid and said hey the emperor is naked
[02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:21.840]  and now all of the media they're going yeah obama's a cook
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:25.840]  yeah it is a war he's super unpopular louis ferrican
[02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:30.800]  acted like he was the second coming now ferrican is called obama a murderer
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:34.160]  i mean i mean obama's stock is going down
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:38.640]  really really i mean as fast as horse and buggy whip stock went down when
[02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:43.680]  henry ford opened up his assembly line yes but it's it's only temporary it
[02:45:43.680 --> 02:45:47.360]  changes on a dime look at the wimpy crats
[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:52.880]  those those those wiener liberals that are in condemning obama
[02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:56.240]  for what he's doing regarding the war powers act
[02:45:56.240 --> 02:45:59.200]  could you imagine if bush tried to pull this off
[02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:05.520]  they'd be screaming bloody murder look at the way the country rallied around obama
[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:09.680]  with the osama vs obama story you know you remember the one
[02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:15.520]  you know we got all oh oh osama and now he's wearing cement shoes and swimming
[02:46:15.520 --> 02:46:19.760]  with the fishes you saw how the people bought that that was almost as good
[02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:23.280]  i obama could come out and say that july 25th
[02:46:23.280 --> 02:46:26.880]  on a large l from the north pole will come down your chimney
[02:46:26.880 --> 02:46:30.400]  and i believe 35 percent of the public would actually be waiting at their
[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:34.480]  chimneys for santa claus exactly so what's going to happen
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:38.080]  alex as we predict this as we're looking forward
[02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:42.640]  watch for a false flag or a real crisis to happen
[02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:47.280]  and the people will rally around obama this is as old as
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:51.920]  as uh you know the the hillard days you know goring
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:55.200]  what you do is you use fear and hysteria
[02:46:55.200 --> 02:47:00.880]  to rally the people around the the political leader they did it with bush
[02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:06.320]  people forget how unpopular he was before 9 11 and there's a guy that
[02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:09.200]  couldn't walk in chew gum at the same time
[02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:13.280]  you know he becomes a huge hero what do you think of rick perry because because
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:15.760]  he's been lying and saying he'd never run
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:19.600]  we knew internally from people that know him he is running
[02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:27.680]  he's a protege of tb also known as carl rove and uh
[02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:30.720]  now he said oh i'm going to break my pledge not to run
[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:35.680]  i may run now i mean these guys lie even when there's no reason to lie
[02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:39.680]  turns out he was the campaign manager of al gore
[02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:42.560]  and this is what people think is a conservative
[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:45.840]  yeah and that the whole thing is if you're voting for the republicans or
[02:47:45.840 --> 02:47:49.680]  democrats you're voting for the two-headed one party system
[02:47:49.680 --> 02:47:54.560]  you're voting for a continuation of of corruption
[02:47:54.560 --> 02:48:00.400]  lies bigotry hypocrisy and helping out their big buddies
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:03.920]  and by the way we're coming out with a trend alert tomorrow
[02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:10.000]  or the next day hopefully tomorrow and it's going to be the salenti solution
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:14.240]  and essentially what it is is that the only way that i can see
[02:48:14.240 --> 02:48:18.800]  a more positive future because people ask me all the time i come up with the
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:22.880]  problems what are the solutions is a direct democracy
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:26.080]  they don't represent us perry doesn't represent me
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:29.360]  gore didn't represent me bush doesn't clinton doesn't
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:35.440]  obama doesn't gore does none of them represent us they represent the people
[02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:39.520]  that give them the most amount of cash to stuff in their pockets
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:44.640]  they call it campaign contributions adults call it bribes and payoffs
[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:50.480]  so on issues of war on immigration on health care on education
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:55.760]  do what they do in switzerland let the people vote
[02:48:55.760 --> 02:48:59.520]  and so what we're going to be doing is launching a major
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:03.760]  effort for the country to move toward a direct
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:10.800]  democracy they don't represent me and they don't know better than i do i don't
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:14.560]  know everything i only know what i know but i don't need
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:19.440]  some jerk that's getting payoffs telling me some little
[02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:23.440]  wiener telling me what i should believe
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:26.960]  what i should do and what's in my self interest
[02:49:26.960 --> 02:49:29.840]  i'm educated and here's the example they're going to use
[02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:34.400]  mr selenti it's not going to work why not we could vote online
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:38.720]  oh you can't vote online they'd be fraud oh yeah you mean like in illinois
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:42.720]  like in florida no they won't be fraud we could do what they do
[02:49:42.720 --> 02:49:46.560]  if you take it like this if i could bank online
[02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:50.880]  i could vote online if i could bank online i could vote online
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:53.920]  put the power back into the hands of the people
[02:49:53.920 --> 02:49:58.480]  bring america to we the people
[02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:02.720]  you know i hear what you're saying about the swiss model of direct
[02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:07.840]  uh democracy but at the same time uh they've super
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:10.960]  navigated and circumnavigated the bill of rights and constitution
[02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:14.400]  the founders were concerned about a direct democracy because they can stage
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:18.880]  a new false flag or a or an obl rabbit out of the hat
[02:50:18.880 --> 02:50:22.400]  and then stampede people in a direct democracy
[02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:27.280]  51 could vote to enslave 49 of us but but we could have a direct
[02:50:27.280 --> 02:50:31.840]  democracy through a uh constitution and a
[02:50:31.840 --> 02:50:35.440]  and a republican form of government where there's the
[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:39.760]  basic codes that then can't be overridden and when we still have courts
[02:50:39.760 --> 02:50:42.800]  involved let me hear more of your solution and your model on the other
[02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:47.440]  side because the globalists have found a way to circumnavigate
[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:51.280]  our constitution bill of rights and it's not that that's failed it's we the
[02:50:51.280 --> 02:50:54.560]  people that have let these crooks do this as long as we're apathetic any
[02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:57.680]  system can be bamboozled and finagled but we'll be

[02:54:20.640 --> 02:54:26.240]  salente i've drawn some silly quick drawings of the
[02:54:26.240 --> 02:54:30.400]  the two-headed monster of the democratic and republican party symbolized by rick
[02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:34.320]  perry and obama and they just trampled over the skeletal
[02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:37.840]  remains of the republic and are leaving some
[02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:42.320]  droppings behind for us and here's another representation of the bloated
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:46.480]  government and there's the people another skeleton suck dry
[02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:53.120]  and the new world order government is telling us to tighten our belts but
[02:54:53.120 --> 02:54:57.520]  that they want more money and that they made
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:01.040]  the sun come up this morning that they made
[02:55:01.040 --> 02:55:07.840]  the grass grow and the flowers sprout we owe everything to them
[02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:13.600]  so um there you have it my friends there you have it
[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:17.440]  uh going back to gerald salente if you went to break i made my comments about
[02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:21.120]  what type of specific direct democracy are you talking about
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:25.120]  because because i see your point and you're saying you know a solution
[02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:27.680]  but wouldn't they just blow up some more world trade centers and say the
[02:55:27.680 --> 02:55:30.880]  easter bunny did it and then well they're gonna do that anyway
[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:35.040]  and they're rigging the game the way it is so we're not getting anything
[02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:40.080]  you take top for example the vast majority of the people who are against it
[02:55:40.080 --> 02:55:44.080]  take libya if they had a vote people would say no
[02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:47.760]  let the people vote let the people vote if this
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:51.120]  this isn't a democracy representative democracy
[02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:54.880]  as i said the only people they represent the politicians
[02:55:54.880 --> 02:55:59.360]  are the people that give them a lot of cash no you're right the current system
[02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:03.840]  has totally been taken over and and congress is just like a vending machine
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:07.360]  and the ruling globalists just put quarters in it and then get the world
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:10.880]  in return that's right and and you know i worked up
[02:56:10.880 --> 02:56:14.080]  in albany as as you know i was the assistant to the secretary of the
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:18.080]  senate and i was also in many years i worked in dc
[02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:21.040]  i know what it looks like i was a government affairs specialist for the
[02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:24.560]  chemical industry so i mean i know how these things work
[02:56:24.560 --> 02:56:27.600]  and and it's the same thing you know money talks
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:30.640]  and and the politicians are talking for the money
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:35.840]  and so what i'm saying is on critical issues whether it's immigration
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:39.840]  whether it's war whether it's education
[02:56:39.840 --> 02:56:45.520]  name the major issue health care reform let the people vote
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:50.160]  and we have no vote we have and here's the line that they keep throwing to us
[02:56:50.160 --> 02:56:53.040]  every election well you know if you don't vote
[02:56:53.040 --> 02:56:56.640]  you get what you deserve what do you mean you get what you deserve
[02:56:56.640 --> 02:57:00.320]  a lesser of two evils oh isn't that wonderful
[02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:04.000]  oh the last person i used to go out with she was terrible
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:09.920]  oh this one she's just rotten i mean what a lesser of two evils
[02:57:09.920 --> 02:57:12.560]  we're about to go to break and come back with five more minutes i just want to
[02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:14.880]  point out that our article rick perry announces
[02:57:14.880 --> 02:57:19.280]  presidential run uh and and he's going to run he lied about the
[02:57:19.280 --> 02:57:21.840]  fact that he wouldn't run he's now breaking that pledge so we're just

[02:58:51.200 --> 02:58:56.400]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:58:56.400 --> 02:59:00.640]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[02:59:00.640 --> 02:59:03.600]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[02:59:03.600 --> 02:59:06.800]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[02:59:06.800 --> 02:59:10.800]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[02:59:10.800 --> 02:59:16.080]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:59:16.080 --> 02:59:19.280]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[02:59:19.280 --> 02:59:23.680]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:59:23.680 --> 02:59:26.960]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[02:59:26.960 --> 02:59:30.720]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is
[02:59:30.720 --> 02:59:34.560]  saying who do we make the check out to today seems like nobody does care
[02:59:34.560 --> 02:59:38.080]  and right now in washington dc we have seen
[02:59:38.080 --> 02:59:41.920]  a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic
[02:59:41.920 --> 02:59:47.280]  on dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high
[02:59:47.280 --> 02:59:52.000]  quality at prison planet dot tv
[02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:57.600]  coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones
[02:59:57.600 --> 03:00:21.520]  broadcasting network network
[03:00:28.560 --> 03:00:33.440]  gerald salin j is our guest and for the next five minutes we're just flat out
[03:00:33.440 --> 03:00:36.800]  of time here but good things are happening on
[03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:40.640]  many fronts texas has brought back the bill
[03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:44.800]  to enforce the law and arrest tsa agents when they molest people
[03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:48.560]  for official oppression so many other things are happening but on the
[03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:51.280]  economic front things are getting scary and this
[03:00:51.280 --> 03:00:55.200]  this hoax gerald that we haven't been in a recession for the last few years and
[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:58.400]  that it's not a depression and all these fake numbers that come out of the
[03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:02.960]  ministry of the truth known as the federal government
[03:01:02.960 --> 03:01:07.120]  now we have the financial times headline trades revealed china shift away from
[03:01:07.120 --> 03:01:09.680]  dollar and they came out last week and said hey
[03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:13.520]  you guys have already technically defaulted as we pointed out years ago
[03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:18.080]  so and of course Bernanke is going to do qe3 i mean the dollar is going to end
[03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:22.160]  up like the peso this is going to be hellish
[03:01:22.160 --> 03:01:25.760]  gerald it is and look what's happening for example
[03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:29.680]  in brazil the brazilians are coming flooding into florida now
[03:01:29.680 --> 03:01:33.440]  their currency has gone up 45 percent against the dollar
[03:01:33.440 --> 03:01:36.320]  you look at the press prices in florida already
[03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:39.760]  they're buying our properties you know for pennies on the dollar so it's like
[03:01:39.760 --> 03:01:42.640]  going to mexico decades ago when the dollar was king
[03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:45.120]  now latin america is going to come here because because they're going to be the
[03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:48.880]  rich people compared to us that's right and that's why i call
[03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:53.360]  osama bin Bernanke you know the public enemy number one
[03:01:53.360 --> 03:01:56.800]  he's the you know he's the doctor death of the economy
[03:01:56.800 --> 03:02:01.600]  and and he just keeps killing it because he makes our
[03:02:01.600 --> 03:02:08.960]  he makes our hard work earn less he makes us all work much harder
[03:02:08.960 --> 03:02:12.960]  and get less for it by devaluing iowa dollar
[03:02:12.960 --> 03:02:16.480]  so the money junkies could keep getting their fix
[03:02:16.480 --> 03:02:20.720]  again look at the data you just mentioned housing starts
[03:02:20.720 --> 03:02:25.760]  oh they just house sales are the lowest since six months it just came out today
[03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:29.520]  six months you mean they're worse now than in january
[03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:34.960]  in february in march you're supposed to have the spring bloom
[03:02:34.960 --> 03:02:39.440]  they're in a depression we're in a depression and as i said
[03:02:39.440 --> 03:02:43.760]  they're marching us off to war mark my words alex
[03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:47.200]  obama will have the people dancing in fear
[03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:51.840]  once again because that fear bandwagon began to roll
[03:02:51.840 --> 03:02:55.760]  on may first with that phony hit against
[03:02:55.760 --> 03:02:59.600]  osama bin laden and it's just going to keep popping up
[03:02:59.600 --> 03:03:03.520]  every time they sink in the polls hey remember
[03:03:03.520 --> 03:03:07.920]  clinton used to do it monica lawinsky let's bomb
[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:14.160]  big dad monica lawinsky let's send in some cruise missiles
[03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:20.000]  and wipe out some al-qaeda somewhere they do it all the time and they're
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:23.440]  going to do it again and later it even comes out that they
[03:03:23.440 --> 03:03:25.840]  issue fake terror alerts for political purposes
[03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:29.600]  governor ridzian writes a book they make money off of their lives
[03:03:29.600 --> 03:03:33.520]  bush writes a book that he ordered torture and makes money off of it
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:37.040]  while he sent people that follow the orders to prison
[03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:40.400]  yeah and as you said what farrakhan said
[03:03:40.400 --> 03:03:44.080]  called uh obama murder in the white house i mean
[03:03:44.080 --> 03:03:48.080]  you know pennsylvania avenue is murderers row
[03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:52.720]  you know go back to the two bushes go back to clinton
[03:03:52.720 --> 03:03:58.000]  go back to obama could anybody call a mass murderer
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:04.160]  what they are a spade a spade look they just killed how many this week in
[03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:08.400]  pakistan one of those lovely pet predators rose
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:11.600]  hey sorry we missed hey here's a headline
[03:04:11.600 --> 03:04:15.040]  from the wall street journal nato admits

[03:04:29.360 --> 03:04:33.600]  the band would be playing and they'd march us off the war
[03:04:33.600 --> 03:04:37.360]  you're absolutely right and and most of what they said about qaddafi strafing
[03:04:37.360 --> 03:04:39.760]  crowds turn out to not be true it's like the
[03:04:39.760 --> 03:04:42.640]  throwing babies out of incubator stories how people send emails going how
[03:04:42.640 --> 03:04:45.440]  dare you be for qaddafi i'm not for qaddafi
