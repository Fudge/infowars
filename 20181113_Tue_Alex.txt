[00:00.000 --> 00:20.120]  Live, Raw and Unfiltered by Globalist Propaganda, it's the Alex Jones show, tomorrow's news
[00:20.120 --> 00:39.160]  today. Well, the election happened seven days ago, but it's ongoing. And I got to
[00:39.160 --> 00:43.720]  hand it to the Democrats and their deep-state controllers. Everyone knows that
[00:43.720 --> 00:48.400]  Broward County steals every election for the Democrats that's close. Everybody
[00:48.400 --> 00:51.880]  knows they always pull up with big trucks with fake ballots and they've got
[00:51.880 --> 00:55.160]  their corrupt police with machine guns guarding them and that's the end of it.
[00:55.160 --> 00:59.520]  They rule and for some reason the Republic of Establishment always rolls
[00:59.520 --> 01:04.920]  over to it because they're in a deal with the Democrats to keep them in the
[01:04.920 --> 01:11.200]  two-party duopoly or nationalism and conservatism and capitalism would take
[01:11.200 --> 01:19.640]  over. And so now they are they've stolen the governor's race in Arizona. They're
[01:19.640 --> 01:22.360]  getting ready to steal the governor's and Senate race and a bunch of other
[01:22.360 --> 01:29.320]  races that were close. And there's videos inside the main tabulation center
[01:29.320 --> 01:33.080]  where they build walls of equipment so you can't see what they're doing with
[01:33.080 --> 01:38.720]  the ballots. All of it violates the law and it's being done brazenly in
[01:38.720 --> 01:43.200]  everybody's face and they're getting more brazen. The Pope came out and said
[01:43.200 --> 01:51.360]  don't have a vote condemning pedophilia. In fact this year when a young man said
[01:51.360 --> 01:57.200]  you know I was raped by a priest, Pope said that's a blessing. It's good to be
[01:57.200 --> 02:05.000]  gay. So now men having sex with little boys is gay. It's the LGBT pedophile
[02:05.000 --> 02:10.840]  movement. If you criticize it well you're a bad person. They'll have lots of
[02:10.840 --> 02:14.480]  headlines. Jones attacks gay people again. Well if it's a staple of being gay
[02:14.480 --> 02:18.600]  that you're a pedophile then yes I am pedoph... homophobic whatever you want to
[02:18.600 --> 02:24.960]  call it. Pedophobic. And then it gets worse from there. It's just so insane how
[02:24.960 --> 02:31.080]  out in the open all of this is. Meanwhile, brink of war, troops and tanks head to the
[02:31.080 --> 02:35.240]  Gaza border after hundreds of missiles rained down on Israel. I don't even
[02:35.240 --> 02:40.560]  agree with that headline. This is a war. It's started. We're gonna be looking at
[02:40.560 --> 02:45.840]  all the different angles of that. Rabbi warns New Israel, Palestinian conflict
[02:45.840 --> 02:54.080]  could be start of biblical war. It's all coming up today and the president has
[02:54.080 --> 02:57.720]  come out and said the Democrats and their harassment of my agenda and their
[02:57.720 --> 03:04.440]  harassment of America is spooking the stock market and can tank it. Well that's
[03:04.440 --> 03:08.080]  totally true. You've got all these prominent people like Bill Maher and
[03:08.080 --> 03:16.080]  others saying we need a plunging economy so we can kick Trump out. That magic
[03:16.080 --> 03:21.360]  one we gotta get rid of it. And then you have Maxine Waters saying last Monday on
[03:21.360 --> 03:25.680]  the eve of the kickoff of the election thieving that's still ongoing. Magical
[03:25.680 --> 03:30.320]  trucks, magical ballots just raining down out of heaven. From California to
[03:30.320 --> 03:39.680]  Florida they're just stealing everything. You knew it was coming. And now it just
[03:39.680 --> 03:43.560]  gets more intense and they say Trump's crazy. We never said we want to hurt the
[03:43.560 --> 03:47.680]  economy. And their whole model is to bankrupt the nation to get full control
[03:47.680 --> 03:51.320]  over you and your family. They even wrote policy reports the Democratic Party
[03:51.320 --> 03:57.200]  adopted since the 70s, clowered and piven. It's well known in third world
[03:57.200 --> 04:00.800]  countries they keep the public poor to control them so that the underclass
[04:00.800 --> 04:06.920]  doesn't get too uppity. Only though renaissance the last 550 years produced a
[04:06.920 --> 04:11.880]  middle class and wealth and the ability to progress and have science. That's what
[04:11.880 --> 04:17.200]  free market is. But the left teaches you know we are the progress. Well yes of the
[04:17.200 --> 04:23.560]  progression of syphilis into the brain, the progression of metastasization of
[04:23.560 --> 04:29.320]  cancer cells. Yes, then you are progressing but not the type of... I can slam my
[04:29.320 --> 04:33.400]  car in reverse and drive it through the garage if I want. Like a nut. I'll be
[04:33.400 --> 04:37.000]  progressing but in the wrong direction. Like an idiot. Like a malfunctioning
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.160]  buffoon. We're not doing that. That's why we are the most attacked, most demonized,
[04:41.160 --> 04:45.600]  most lied about broadcast in the world. So it's all coming up in an even bigger
[04:45.600 --> 04:53.760]  doozy. Democrats are filing suit saying that Trump has no authority to have this
[04:53.760 --> 04:57.640]  new interim attorney general. That's like saying Trump has no authority to brush
[04:57.640 --> 05:02.880]  his teeth in the morning. The globalists know that if they suppress the good
[05:02.880 --> 05:06.520]  halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine,
[05:06.520 --> 05:11.720]  bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It literally dumbs the population down.
[05:11.720 --> 05:15.800]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodide in the
[05:15.800 --> 05:21.280]  world, we've gone through two permutations. First seaweed-based iodine that was
[05:21.280 --> 05:24.400]  pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a
[05:24.400 --> 05:29.120]  supply of it. So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and
[05:29.120 --> 05:33.360]  brought UX2 that's been incredible. Now, due to the establishment trying to block
[05:33.360 --> 05:38.280]  that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent
[05:38.280 --> 05:42.600]  iodine. But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by
[05:42.600 --> 05:47.360]  combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it
[05:47.360 --> 05:53.720]  supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen, you
[05:53.720 --> 05:58.040]  want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3, now
[05:58.040 --> 06:15.560]  available at m4slife.com. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to
[06:15.560 --> 06:28.200]  you live from the front lines of the Info War. Here we are Tuesday, November 13th,
[06:28.200 --> 06:34.080]  2018. I'm Alex Jones, your host. And we're seven days after that historic
[06:34.080 --> 06:39.440]  election, a referendum on nationalism and free market and prosperity versus
[06:39.440 --> 06:43.920]  globalism and collapsing third world nations and world government, corporate
[06:43.920 --> 06:50.360]  world government, chai-com rule. We have the Davos Axis with Yonker happening
[06:50.360 --> 06:55.280]  with the dictatorial EU. We're to believe everywhere else in the world where
[06:55.280 --> 06:59.160]  they've had elections, nationalists and patriots like Trump get elected for the
[06:59.160 --> 07:04.720]  last six years, 22 major global elections around the world, but magically here
[07:04.720 --> 07:11.600]  where they said they'd make their stand magically, magically. Trump, even though
[07:11.600 --> 07:15.800]  the polls showed he was only five points, this was a referendum on Trump, even
[07:15.800 --> 07:19.840]  though the Trump Republican takeover was only five points behind and skewed
[07:19.840 --> 07:25.080]  polls over sampling 10 to 15 points more Democrat, magically, even though they
[07:25.080 --> 07:31.680]  were skewing 20 points or more in the election two years ago, magically this
[07:31.680 --> 07:39.280]  time they gained 23 seats and then it was 30 seats. Now it's 40 seats and they
[07:39.280 --> 07:44.160]  just keep finding ballots in California and Arizona and Florida and other
[07:44.160 --> 07:50.000]  states and they just arrive at Democrat precincts that are famous for corruption
[07:50.000 --> 07:54.040]  and who've been found in court to do it in California, Arizona and Florida and
[07:54.040 --> 08:00.920]  magically, Florida is turning blue. Now Arizona's turned blue for the first time
[08:00.920 --> 08:07.960]  ever. It's so magic. In Texas they had illegals vote, they had people vote in the
[08:07.960 --> 08:12.160]  name of dead people, you could see all the skewed numbers, they really tried to
[08:12.160 --> 08:20.600]  stuff the ballot box for old Bito, Bivo, but old Beto, Bivo, Pito, however you say
[08:20.600 --> 08:28.920]  his name, he's still lost by two points, but then Abbott won by seven even though
[08:28.920 --> 08:34.680]  it should be about exactly the same and then we saw that in these other key
[08:34.680 --> 08:39.440]  Texas races that magically these Democrat-controlled cities had many
[08:39.440 --> 08:53.120]  precincts 100% Bito. Isn't that just magical? 100%. I was going over this with
[08:53.120 --> 08:57.080]  an election expert yesterday to a special report for us, Richard Reeves and he is
[08:57.080 --> 09:01.280]  an expert and predicted everything that happened two years ago about a year
[09:01.280 --> 09:05.000]  before it took place. He's the one that got the superdelegates to first admit
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.320]  that they were gonna give it to Hillary regardless of Bernie winning all those
[09:08.320 --> 09:14.320]  states. Remember that? We got that to the president. Mr. Miller got it to the
[09:14.320 --> 09:18.640]  president. Richard Reeves also interviewed Mr. Miller who writes a lot of Trump
[09:18.640 --> 09:25.720]  speeches. He's a great patriot who they're trying to take out of course, but he
[09:25.720 --> 09:28.680]  sat there yesterday and went over all the numbers and showed me their own maps
[09:28.680 --> 09:34.600]  and it's incredible. So here's the big takeaway. Everybody knows it. The
[09:34.600 --> 09:37.480]  question is what are we gonna do about it because the Democrats have what you
[09:37.480 --> 09:49.000]  call criminal energy. They have criminal will. They have criminal energy and
[09:49.000 --> 09:55.400]  criminal will to do everything they're doing and they work with other criminals
[09:55.400 --> 09:59.680]  around the world and they are not Americans. They hate America. They say
[09:59.680 --> 10:05.120]  they hate America. No borders, no walls, no USA at all. They teach the illegal
[10:05.120 --> 10:08.680]  aliens how to hate America. They teach them how to lie to get in. Same thing
[10:08.680 --> 10:13.720]  happens in Europe. It's all with the UN NGOs.
[10:18.720 --> 10:24.840]  This is now the operating system of the dumbed down followers in this country
[10:24.840 --> 10:29.040]  that make up a Democratic Party and the universities and the academic systems.
[10:29.040 --> 10:33.840]  And they're out bullying and attacking everyone and boycotting everyone and
[10:33.840 --> 10:38.200]  harassing everyone who won't submit to them and of course they're stealing
[10:38.200 --> 10:44.200]  elections. They're doing it in famous counties certified and convicted over
[10:44.200 --> 10:49.560]  and over and over again and you ask well then why is the head of the board of
[10:49.560 --> 10:54.640]  election still there? It's always the underlings of her that get found guilty.
[10:54.640 --> 11:01.400]  It's never her. She never gets her hands dirty. She's a good girl and it's the
[11:01.400 --> 11:07.680]  same county where you have the police standing now. It's the same county where
[11:07.680 --> 11:13.240]  you get Debbie Washington Schultz and oh Congressman Deutsch who's sworn to get
[11:13.240 --> 11:18.480]  me shut down off the internet and then they did. They're coming for your
[11:18.480 --> 11:21.760]  children. They're coming for your free speech. They're coming for your guns.
[11:21.760 --> 11:25.840]  They're coming for your property. They're coming for you. They are conscious
[11:25.840 --> 11:31.320]  criminals that follow the latest methodology of control globally. The
[11:31.320 --> 11:36.680]  exact same operations. They represent multinational corporations that have
[11:36.680 --> 11:41.680]  established the IMF, the World Bank, the TPP, the European Union and other
[11:41.680 --> 11:47.520]  private corporate bodies. The EU is the Marshall Plan. It's what the
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.200]  robber barons got the U.S. to invest at the end of World War II to rebuild
[11:51.200 --> 11:55.400]  Europe, not for the Europeans and not for us, not for America to run Europe. We
[11:55.400 --> 11:59.520]  could have stayed there and run the thing but the corporations they run it
[11:59.520 --> 12:04.800]  and they've got a plan and they've got Macron up there telling you two plus two
[12:04.800 --> 12:11.760]  equals five billion saying quote nationalism is unpatriotic. Nationalism
[12:11.760 --> 12:15.320]  means you have rules, you have laws, you have a country, you have a culture, you
[12:15.320 --> 12:19.000]  stand up for each other, you organize because there's outside threats. It's the
[12:19.000 --> 12:23.160]  only reason for a state to exist and we've had one of the best states ever
[12:23.160 --> 12:26.680]  in America. It's why we had so much wealth, how everybody wants to come here
[12:26.680 --> 12:32.480]  and then exploit it. We become soft and Macron is a total trader and what did
[12:32.480 --> 12:36.600]  Trump say? He said you're lucky America exists or you'd be speaking German.
[12:36.600 --> 12:41.840]  Your own Vici French sold out to the Germans. Traders like Macron, you know
[12:41.840 --> 12:46.280]  the French didn't even fight. They were ordered to stand down. Almost all of their
[12:46.280 --> 12:52.120]  generals were bought off. How do you think we went so quick in desert storm and all
[12:52.120 --> 12:55.840]  those wars? We buy their generals. It's a smart thing to do but you got to have
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.080]  traders to do it and the Muslims are very easy to buy and so are the French.
[13:01.080 --> 13:04.920]  A lot of great French people, the French used to really fight and I guess Napoleon
[13:04.920 --> 13:06.840]  broke their spirit when it came to war because they used to be one of the most
[13:06.840 --> 13:10.760]  warlock aggressive folks. They said all the tough men, French used to be some of
[13:10.760 --> 13:16.120]  the biggest people in Europe, vicious Gauls. Last group the Romans were able to
[13:16.120 --> 13:21.680]  take over on the continent. They now have just bred into them being shellouts
[13:21.680 --> 13:25.360]  and being selfish just like Americans have become. Hey let's not look down on
[13:25.360 --> 13:33.480]  France boy. The Democrats almost took Texas. We are a emasculated joke. Men
[13:33.480 --> 13:38.440]  don't have will. They roll over and kiss ass hoping that Curry's favor with
[13:38.440 --> 13:44.680]  ruthless globalist whose operating system is anti-America. People ask me how
[13:44.680 --> 13:47.840]  are you taking being a demonized and lying about? How are you taking? I'm taking it
[13:47.840 --> 13:51.640]  fine. I'm a man fighting for my country that has a much better system than what
[13:51.640 --> 13:55.000]  they're trying to put on my children. I've got what you call instincts and
[13:55.000 --> 14:01.360]  spirit. In fact I'm doing real good. I'm in total war mode. I got so much energy
[14:01.360 --> 14:06.760]  I'm bouncing off the walls like a ping-pong ball. My country is under
[14:06.760 --> 14:12.640]  attack. I'm being usurped. I'm being enslaved. And of course Trump admires
[14:12.640 --> 14:16.040]  Putin for standing up and kicking the globalist out. We should all admire
[14:16.040 --> 14:19.320]  Vladimir Putin. I thought about it today. I'm not going to give half-hearted
[14:19.320 --> 14:23.280]  support for Putin. Putin is the model of taking our nations back and then
[14:23.280 --> 14:28.880]  brigs it and then America leading the world and now Brazil and now Italy. It's
[14:28.880 --> 14:38.160]  happening at Austria and Germany. It's all coming back. Instead of the EU run by
[14:38.160 --> 14:45.320]  Junker, the king of Luxembourg, whose father was the richest Nazi who took it
[14:45.320 --> 14:50.760]  over by force and now it's a Nazi project to collapse Europe and
[14:50.760 --> 14:55.200]  collapse the nations and suck them dry and then have an EU army to enforce over
[14:55.200 --> 15:05.880]  them. Macron is a literal Vichy French trader, literally. This is a Vichy
[15:05.880 --> 15:10.280]  French plan. They were going to share power over Europe and North Africa in
[15:10.280 --> 15:15.800]  the Nazi world kingdom. What you think the people offer world kingdoms is this
[15:15.800 --> 15:20.520]  just this just arrived after World War II? This was already being planned. The
[15:20.520 --> 15:26.200]  new world order is a planetary world government run out of Europe and the
[15:26.200 --> 15:37.320]  Bible said it would come 2,000 years ago. Unbelievable. Please remember without
[15:37.320 --> 15:39.840]  your financial support, we will not be here. We have one of the biggest sales

[15:55.080 --> 15:57.520]  Sunday.
[15:58.840 --> 16:03.800]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high
[16:03.800 --> 16:07.880]  cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are
[16:07.880 --> 16:12.200]  there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and
[16:12.200 --> 16:16.120]  irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something
[16:16.120 --> 16:20.040]  is wrong. Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in
[16:20.040 --> 16:24.360]  thousands of people's lives across America. My blood pressure has normalized
[16:24.360 --> 16:28.120]  my diabetes has totally improved. Everyone is telling me now how much
[16:28.120 --> 16:31.200]  healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I
[16:31.200 --> 16:34.760]  recommend heart and body extract to everyone. Anybody over 40 in the
[16:34.760 --> 16:39.280]  North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep
[16:39.280 --> 16:43.240]  their cardiovascular system healthy. Order your two-month supply today by

[16:58.680 --> 17:02.280]  In these uncertain times it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to
[17:02.280 --> 17:06.280]  cook food and boil water. If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove
[17:06.280 --> 17:10.040]  or cooking over an open fire then there's a much better way. The Minimpan
[17:10.040 --> 17:13.880]  rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove that only requires small
[17:13.880 --> 17:17.640]  quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel. The Minimpan stove is easy to use,
[17:17.640 --> 17:21.360]  smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable. For the finest in survival

[20:26.840 --> 20:34.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. The United States is under
[20:34.560 --> 20:46.440]  attack. This is the main line statement of the Democratic Party. America was
[20:46.440 --> 20:53.680]  never great. It'll never be great. Governor Cuomo, the globalists are
[20:53.680 --> 20:57.920]  here to break our laws. They're here to take over our country. They're here to
[20:57.920 --> 21:02.040]  conquer us. They're here to suck the stride like Venezuela, like North
[21:02.040 --> 21:08.960]  Korea, like China. And they mean business. The Democrats have openly stolen the
[21:08.960 --> 21:14.720]  governorship in Arizona. I was reading where the conservative would be 1,800
[21:14.720 --> 21:18.560]  votes ahead and then suddenly the Democratic counties would find 2,000.
[21:18.560 --> 21:21.720]  And it just happened over and over again. And they're there in Broward County in
[21:21.720 --> 21:26.840]  Florida with just truck after truck arriving days after the law says they
[21:26.840 --> 21:30.720]  can't and no one knows where they're from. And they admit when people put
[21:30.720 --> 21:33.920]  cameras on them, these are provisional. It doesn't matter. Just cram them in, cram
[21:33.920 --> 21:39.200]  them in. And you've got Democrats and former Hillary staffers and former
[21:39.200 --> 21:45.800]  moveon.org and current groups on the news are manning this as volunteers. And if
[21:45.800 --> 21:50.560]  they see cameras, they put up walls. They use bins to block it out. And then they
[21:50.560 --> 21:55.000]  just start shoving everything in to the machines, looking over their shoulders.
[21:59.000 --> 22:03.400]  It is the most over the top suspicious behavior and the county's been caught
[22:03.400 --> 22:05.040]  stealing elections over and over again.
[22:08.880 --> 22:15.120]  Meanwhile, you've got the EU. You've got CBS television. You've got every channel
[22:15.120 --> 22:23.960]  out there, world leaders saying nations don't exist. They're bad. Now, a nation
[22:23.960 --> 22:29.840]  existing is evil because the globalists have five billion plus third world
[22:29.840 --> 22:34.560]  people, almost six billion. I guess it's more than that because there's 7.5 billion
[22:34.560 --> 22:40.920]  people and only about a billion you could say live in the first world. And a lot
[22:40.920 --> 22:44.440]  of those are in third world conditions too. I'd say there's 800 million people
[22:44.440 --> 22:52.920]  living at first world standards. That leaves six billion, 700, 800 million
[22:52.920 --> 22:57.520]  people. That number's about to be eight, nine billion third world who are being
[22:57.520 --> 23:03.960]  taught the West is yours by big mega corporations that are building armored
[23:03.960 --> 23:11.280]  compounds in Tasmania and Kauai. I mean, they are about to smash everything.
[23:11.280 --> 23:15.440]  Bill of Rights Constitution, your pension funds, they're going to swindle all
[23:15.440 --> 23:19.680]  of those. That's why socialists finally woke up too late in Europe from Germany
[23:19.680 --> 23:26.680]  to Sweden to Spain are now saying we don't want to have 200, 300 million
[23:26.680 --> 23:29.800]  people from the Middle East and North Africa here who have no skills and are
[23:29.800 --> 23:33.840]  violent and who will all be on welfare. We're going to go bankrupt. That's the
[23:33.840 --> 23:37.480]  plan. And then after it collapses, they're going to come in with a new
[23:37.480 --> 23:43.600]  super EU stabilization package and army. How do I know this? Because I know how
[23:43.600 --> 23:47.680]  they do it to third world countries. And I envisioned it and two months after I
[23:47.680 --> 23:52.480]  said it in 2016, Soros came out officially and said we need a Marshall
[23:52.480 --> 23:59.160]  plan. We're going to collapse Europe. Not hard to figure that out. The EU is
[23:59.160 --> 24:04.000]  meant to strangle and suck Europe dry and then open its borders and implode
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.760]  it. David Knight did a devastating breakdown of nationalism versus
[24:07.760 --> 24:13.280]  globalism today this morning. Here it is. Patriotism, as I said, it's
[24:13.280 --> 24:16.200]  mentally about what I said. It's about defending your home. That's one of the
[24:16.200 --> 24:21.320]  only reasons to fight. Defend your home, defend the Constitution. Patriotism is
[24:21.320 --> 24:26.000]  defending your home. Nationalism is defending your legal system, your
[24:26.000 --> 24:30.320]  constitution, your way of life, your culture. And those are things worth
[24:30.320 --> 24:37.960]  fighting for. The European army will be used to suppress the culture, the legal
[24:37.960 --> 24:43.400]  system, and it'll be used to destroy the homeland of the European people.
[24:46.760 --> 24:53.920]  You're listening to the David Knight show. We had Macron lecturing us. Of course,
[24:53.920 --> 24:57.160]  you've heard the quote many times by now. Patriotism is the exact opposite of
[24:57.160 --> 25:01.480]  nationalism, he said. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. You stick to
[25:01.480 --> 25:05.800]  it English types. Yeah, well, not at all. Not at all. I'll tell you what
[25:05.800 --> 25:14.000]  patriotism is. Patriotism was summed up by Smedley Butler. He said, talking about
[25:14.000 --> 25:20.920]  true patriotism, he said, we fight to protect our home and our Constitution. So
[25:20.920 --> 25:27.440]  we fight to defend our lives, to defend our lives. Not in foreign wars of
[25:27.440 --> 25:32.840]  empire, not for regime change in the Middle East. We fight to defend our
[25:32.840 --> 25:37.360]  homes. He said everything else is a racket. It is organized crime and he was
[25:37.360 --> 25:41.760]  exactly right. Patriotism is about fighting to defend your homeland.
[25:41.760 --> 25:46.680]  Nationalism is about fighting to defend your political system and the values
[25:46.680 --> 25:52.760]  embodied in that political and legal system, in our Constitution. And if we
[25:52.760 --> 25:56.680]  had stuck to those values, we would have never been drawn into World War I.
[25:56.680 --> 26:01.920]  Macron then went on to say, he said, in saying that our interests are first,
[26:01.920 --> 26:04.920]  whatever happens to others, you erase the most precious thing a nation can have,
[26:04.920 --> 26:07.920]  that which makes it live, that which causes it to be great, and that which is
[26:07.920 --> 26:12.400]  as most important as its moral values. Well, of course. And quite frankly,
[26:12.400 --> 26:18.160]  however, Macron is embracing the same type of real politic that Henry
[26:18.160 --> 26:21.600]  Kissinger embraced and made popular along with that phrase, real
[26:21.600 --> 26:28.720]  politic. What that means is the politics of pragmatism. We do whatever is in our
[26:28.720 --> 26:33.200]  interest. And as Henry Kissinger famously said, he said, we don't have any
[26:33.200 --> 26:39.360]  permanent allies. We have permanent interests and they have no morals and
[26:39.360 --> 26:45.960]  no principles whatsoever. Henry Kissinger, who has said that soldiers are
[26:45.960 --> 26:50.640]  nothing but animals to be slaughtered, paraphrased what he had to say. But we
[26:50.640 --> 26:55.280]  have seen what he believes and what he did. Let's contrast that a little bit to
[26:55.280 --> 26:59.920]  the founding fathers. James Madison, we've said this many times, a standing
[26:59.920 --> 27:03.800]  military force with an overgrown executive will not long be safe
[27:03.800 --> 27:08.000]  companions to liberty. The means of defense against foreign danger have
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.760]  always been the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans, it was a
[27:11.760 --> 27:17.200]  standing maxim to excite a war whenever a revolt was apprehended. That is what
[27:17.200 --> 27:21.360]  we're coming up to. We will have war excited. There may be an
[27:21.360 --> 27:25.760]  accompanied economic cause. There is certainly a cultural clash that is
[27:25.760 --> 27:29.040]  building, as I said before, the election regardless of who wins or loses or how
[27:29.040 --> 27:33.880]  they stuff the ballots. You're going to have more and more unrest. And they know
[27:33.880 --> 27:38.560]  that. And they're going to use a war. They're going to start a war to try to
[27:38.560 --> 27:43.480]  control us. Maybe Emmanuel Macron should read the writing of our former
[27:43.480 --> 27:46.800]  president, James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights. He said throughout
[27:46.800 --> 27:53.440]  Europe, the armies kept under the pretext of defending have enslaved the
[27:53.440 --> 28:02.440]  people. And quite frankly, that is the true purpose of Macron's EU army. He's not
[28:02.440 --> 28:05.400]  going to be putting that up there to protect them from foreign invasions.
[28:05.400 --> 28:11.280]  He's inviting the foreign invaders, the fifth columns coming into the country.
[28:11.280 --> 28:18.000]  He's opened up the borders. He's part of the globalist open border cartel. He is
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.360]  not going to defend people. He's going to use the army to attack the people who
[28:23.360 --> 28:29.520]  object to that, who object to having their homes destroyed. See, patriotism, as I
[28:29.520 --> 28:32.680]  said, it's mentally butler said it's about defending your home. That's one of
[28:32.680 --> 28:36.480]  the only reasons to fight. Defend your home, defend the Constitution.
[28:36.480 --> 28:42.080]  Patriotism is defending your home. Nationalism is defending your legal
[28:42.080 --> 28:46.400]  system, your Constitution, your way of life, your culture. All right, the full
[28:46.400 --> 28:50.520]  report is going to be posted to M4Wars.com and NewsWars.com where David
[28:50.520 --> 28:55.680]  Knight gives you the definition of nationalism and patriotism versus
[28:55.680 --> 29:00.720]  globalism. But this is a takeover. Trading involves financial risk. It is not
[29:00.720 --> 29:05.280]  suitable for all investors. Marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our
[29:05.280 --> 29:10.400]  nation. It's creating $10.8 billion in new wealth a year and every day it's

[31:26.560 --> 31:30.120]  back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended
[31:30.120 --> 31:35.200]  hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy, and drive to get to the

[32:00.000 --> 32:04.460]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real
[32:04.460 --> 32:08.760]  drama can be found here in Lailania States, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[32:08.760 --> 32:13.160]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[32:13.160 --> 32:18.560]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[32:18.560 --> 32:23.560]  pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests
[32:23.560 --> 32:28.880]  for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH. What we learned was that there was in
[32:28.880 --> 32:33.760]  fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we
[32:33.760 --> 32:38.080]  tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter and not only were the
[32:38.080 --> 32:42.840]  heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to
[32:42.840 --> 32:48.320]  optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH
[32:48.320 --> 32:52.880]  of the water, so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can
[32:52.880 --> 32:57.920]  contaminate a rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water filtration
[32:57.920 --> 33:01.120]  system will purify it.
[33:01.120 --> 33:12.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:21.120 --> 33:27.120]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're
[33:27.120 --> 33:33.640]  listening to Alex Jones. Well, Roger Stone and his lawyer Tyler Nixon are going
[33:33.640 --> 33:37.680]  to join us on the huge White House shake-ups. The internal documents leaked
[33:37.680 --> 33:42.520]  to One American News Network that they found no Russian collusion but are
[33:42.520 --> 33:47.320]  trying to frame people. This is bombshell exclusive stuff you're going to be
[33:47.320 --> 33:54.200]  getting. That's next segment. We're going to be getting into the Democratic
[33:54.200 --> 33:59.120]  Party and others saying they're going to sue Trump saying it's illegal for him
[33:59.120 --> 34:05.360]  to have an appointment of an attorney general for 210 days before they have a
[34:05.360 --> 34:09.760]  vote when it's in the Constitution and I'm going to read you the subsection. But
[34:09.760 --> 34:12.480]  they think their constituents are idiots and they want to just say
[34:12.480 --> 34:17.960]  everything is illegitimate. And Maxine Waters last Monday on the eve of this
[34:17.960 --> 34:23.120]  ongoing election theft as they steal the election nationwide and as their gains
[34:23.120 --> 34:27.520]  go from 20 seats to 40 seats and they may lose the Senate now. I mean it's
[34:27.520 --> 34:33.440]  incredible. Governorships, you name it, they're going for broke. They have come
[34:33.440 --> 34:37.440]  out and she has said that she's going to roll back the rollback of regulations
[34:37.440 --> 34:41.920]  and going to go after all these companies that are moving here. So she's
[34:41.920 --> 34:46.000]  announcing, hey, business isn't welcome here in America as she literally sits
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.560]  there with legislation blocking fire breaks in Southern California that
[34:50.560 --> 34:56.800]  everybody else has and allowing the inferno. These people, everything they
[34:56.800 --> 35:01.320]  infest burns down, piles of human feces, needles everywhere, mismanagement,
[35:01.320 --> 35:09.040]  Venezuela because it's what they do. They love it. They're criminals. So that's
[35:09.040 --> 35:13.440]  all coming up as well. It is just insane. Now we're going to give you the
[35:13.440 --> 35:18.560]  exclusive. We knew this a year ago that we were being nice to General Kelly and
[35:18.560 --> 35:23.360]  not trying to stir up trouble for the White House. But Trump announced he's
[35:23.360 --> 35:29.120]  going to fire Kelly's girlfriend. And I was told this a year ago and I was told
[35:29.120 --> 35:33.760]  this two days ago by Roger Stone. But he said, let's not go with it yet because
[35:33.760 --> 35:37.240]  let's just let them break it. But we're going to go ahead and break it now
[35:37.240 --> 35:40.640]  because Trump's ready to flush it just like we held our fire on Bannon until
[35:40.640 --> 35:45.560]  it was ready. But now the political daggers are going to come out. So you're
[35:45.560 --> 35:49.280]  going to get all the exclusive with Tyler Nixon and Roger Stone right now.
[35:49.280 --> 35:53.360]  And notice the fast and furious pace now. After the elections, just getting
[35:53.360 --> 35:56.640]  crazier globally. Democrats are going for broke. They're totally stealing,
[35:56.640 --> 35:59.760]  totally opening the borders. We have all this video of them training the
[35:59.760 --> 36:03.400]  illegal aliens, how to get in, how to lie, how to say they're asylum seekers.
[36:03.400 --> 36:07.400]  Exact same video out of Europe poses Christians. But once you get there, it's
[36:07.400 --> 36:12.440]  killing time. I mean, this is a global World War four run by the big banks, the
[36:12.440 --> 36:17.200]  big corporations against nation states. It's on. And we must have the demarcation
[36:17.200 --> 36:21.080]  line of which side you're on free market, your own nation, your own country in a
[36:21.080 --> 36:24.320]  future or globalist loot in the hell out of you and turning you into a third
[36:24.320 --> 36:27.920]  world country. You got a choice. And that's why they're shutting us down
[36:27.920 --> 36:32.080]  ahead of this because they don't want you to have that choice. No borders, no
[36:32.080 --> 36:36.960]  wall, no USA at all. No borders, no wall, no European countries at all. Nations
[36:36.960 --> 36:41.520]  are bad, only unelected EU run by the air, the Nazi fortune, Junker and the
[36:41.520 --> 36:45.920]  ally with the chai comms, pledging he could defeat Europe and pledging he could
[36:45.920 --> 36:50.200]  defeat American nationalist two years ago and Trump got elected. And now
[36:50.200 --> 36:55.160]  they're just up there. The head of the Vatican says, do not investigate pedophiles.
[36:55.160 --> 37:00.200]  Shut down all investigations in the United States. And the left is, yeah, don't
[37:00.200 --> 37:07.160]  stand up for people raped in satanic rituals in Pennsylvania in, in Catholic
[37:07.160 --> 37:13.720]  churches in circling up to 15 men raping six year old boys and telling them
[37:13.720 --> 37:17.520]  this is the sacrament ejaculating in their mouths. I hate to have to talk like
[37:17.520 --> 37:22.080]  that, but that's in the police reports confirmed. And you understand this is a
[37:22.080 --> 37:27.280]  Satan cult to, to, to, to, that's what Satanists do is they, they have rituals
[37:27.280 --> 37:31.800]  in churches, they defile Christ, they defile the Holy Ghost, they defile.
[37:31.800 --> 37:37.960]  That's what they do. So it's all happening. And the Pope loves it.
[37:37.960 --> 37:42.360]  Guaranteed he's into it. His deputy Pope is in, is a secret trial in
[37:42.360 --> 37:48.040]  Australia with over 100 rape boys. Some of them never got found again. And they
[37:48.040 --> 37:53.200]  just found a bunch of dead girls in the Vatican last week. That's right. Little
[37:53.200 --> 37:57.400]  girls that got grabbed off the streets and their parents, people said they were
[37:57.400 --> 38:00.800]  picked up by the Vatican for satanic rituals. Well, they found them and they
[38:00.800 --> 38:06.240]  did. Now let's go to Roger Stone, Truth or Stranger than fiction and Tyler
[38:06.240 --> 38:12.880]  Nixon. We are so much to get to here. Stone cold truth.com at Tyler Nixon at
[38:12.880 --> 38:16.280]  Tyler P. Nixon on Twitter. Of course, Roger's at info wars. He works with
[38:16.280 --> 38:19.800]  info wars. We're gonna, we're gonna have you guys on for a few segments. And then
[38:19.800 --> 38:23.120]  we have Katie Hopkins in studio with us. And then we have Mark Dice coming on. So
[38:23.120 --> 38:27.040]  big, big lineup today. But this is such an epic time, gentlemen, as we're trying
[38:27.040 --> 38:31.600]  to relaunch America and relaunch the Renaissance and the globals are trying to
[38:31.600 --> 38:34.880]  block it. It's so clear to anyone who's informed. But, but, but here we are. So
[38:34.880 --> 38:38.480]  let's get into what's really going on with General Kelly and the fact that
[38:38.480 --> 38:44.280]  he's about to be ousted. Well, Alex, you will recall that some weeks ago, there
[38:44.280 --> 38:48.920]  was a report that General Kelly and John Bolton, the president's national
[38:48.920 --> 38:54.000]  security advisor actually got into a scuffle outside the Oval Office. My
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.600]  sources tell me that's because Bolton made some Congress, some comment to
[38:58.600 --> 39:03.880]  General Kelly regarding his personal relationship with Kristen Nielsen, the
[39:03.880 --> 39:10.440]  head of Homeland Security and Kelly's former top deputy. It is an open secret
[39:10.440 --> 39:16.160]  in Washington that Kelly and Nielsen are, as they say, an item having an
[39:16.160 --> 39:21.000]  affair. It was reported yesterday that the president is on the verge of firing
[39:21.000 --> 39:27.200]  Nielsen. To me, that is a clear signal that Kelly's power is on the wane. And now
[39:27.200 --> 39:33.960]  you see multiple hints that Kelly's replacement will be imminent. I think
[39:33.960 --> 39:39.120]  that that is because Kelly has opposed efforts by the president to bring the
[39:39.120 --> 39:45.360]  out of control Mueller probe under control under the new acting attorney
[39:45.360 --> 39:51.160]  general. The Democrats claiming that the acting attorney general, Matthew
[39:51.160 --> 39:57.440]  Whitaker, should recuse himself based on his previous political positions, is a
[39:57.440 --> 40:03.360]  laughable joke given the makeup of Mr. Mueller's squad. But what we know, we'll
[40:03.360 --> 40:07.080]  get into the whole Russia canard, which is not news anymore, but it is news that's
[40:07.080 --> 40:11.240]  finally coming to an end. And this incredible one American news network
[40:11.240 --> 40:15.400]  where they got the documents, it's on infowars.com, and it's the internal
[40:15.400 --> 40:19.400]  documents, the FBI saying no evidence, no nothing. All we've got is maybe twisting
[40:19.400 --> 40:24.400]  some people's words into perjury. And so they have absolutely come up like Trump
[40:24.400 --> 40:28.280]  said a month ago. Rosenstein told him, sir, here's a report, nothing was found,
[40:28.280 --> 40:32.040]  absolutely no one collided with Russia, except Hillary and Mueller himself. And
[40:32.040 --> 40:35.000]  this was all to run out the clock, we know, on the statute of limitations for
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.240]  Mueller and uranium one. That was their first goal, then discredit the elections
[40:39.240 --> 40:45.280]  and then try to indict a bunch of Trump's most savvy and dogged supporters
[40:45.280 --> 40:48.600]  like Roger Stone. Tyler Nixon, we're going to break here in a few minutes, but
[40:48.600 --> 40:53.760]  as a lawyer and a long, you know, time confidant, Roger Stone, who also just
[40:53.760 --> 40:58.200]  testified to the grand jury just last week, what would you call this point of
[40:58.200 --> 41:05.320]  history we're at? Oh, it's seminal, it's a major juncture, it's
[41:05.320 --> 41:09.520]  make or break, I think, really. Either we stand and deliver for the Constitution
[41:09.520 --> 41:14.960]  and for freedom and for liberty for all people and justice, or we capitulate to
[41:14.960 --> 41:20.560]  the horde, to the mob, to the to the giant collectivist Borg with with its
[41:20.560 --> 41:25.680]  ruling elites that will, you know, have no right to power, have no, no really
[41:25.680 --> 41:29.320]  claim to it in terms of their abilities or the results that they produce, yet they
[41:29.320 --> 41:32.840]  will use force and they will use the mob, they will use any means available to
[41:32.840 --> 41:37.280]  enslave humanity and keep their keep their power and lord over us. And I
[41:37.280 --> 41:42.480]  think this is really its breakpoint for the world, for the globe. That is
[41:42.480 --> 41:46.080]  exactly where we are. And then the bizarreness where they say nations are
[41:46.080 --> 41:50.200]  now bad. We formed an army, we won't let you leave when these countries didn't
[41:50.200 --> 41:55.840]  vote to join the EU. And then Trump says, hey, buddy, we saved your ass from the Nazis
[41:55.840 --> 42:00.800]  when French government collaborated and totally laid down, oh, the British fought
[42:00.800 --> 42:05.560]  back and got run to Dunkirk. I mean, people don't know, the French stood
[42:05.560 --> 42:12.280]  down, the French occupied themselves and Macron is now right in line with the
[42:12.280 --> 42:18.480]  Marshalls that did that. Yeah, those comments by Macron were just absurd.
[42:18.480 --> 42:22.800]  Patriotism and nationalism, I mean, it's semantics really. What it comes down to
[42:22.800 --> 42:27.280]  is what do you believe in? Do you believe in being ruled by a global elite sitting
[42:27.280 --> 42:33.120]  atop a bunch of violent street thugs, pushing collectivist ideology that
[42:33.120 --> 42:36.880]  really just comes down to, again, the ruling elite. It's amazing that they
[42:36.880 --> 42:40.840]  would hide behind collectivist ideologies as though it's for the greater good.
[42:40.840 --> 42:44.640]  When we all know it's about enriching those atop. And that's exactly what we
[42:44.640 --> 42:47.680]  see in the Democrat Party today. These people don't stand for anything
[42:47.680 --> 42:51.760]  anymore. 85 targets of investigation. What are they? They're just an
[42:51.760 --> 42:59.360]  investigative hive mind. Intent on they have mutated into a criminal cult. The
[42:59.360 --> 43:02.920]  globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the
[43:02.920 --> 43:06.480]  environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[43:06.480 --> 43:12.320]  that it lowers IQ, it literally dumbs the population down. And on our quest to
[43:12.320 --> 43:16.120]  bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through
[43:16.120 --> 43:21.280]  two permutations. First seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to
[43:21.280 --> 43:24.720]  source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we
[43:24.720 --> 43:29.320]  discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's
[43:29.320 --> 43:33.160]  been incredible. Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we
[43:33.160 --> 43:37.600]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[43:37.600 --> 43:42.320]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it
[43:42.320 --> 43:47.680]  with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it super charges
[43:47.680 --> 43:53.000]  it and makes it even more bio available. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.680]  research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3 now available at
[43:57.680 --> 44:02.480]  InfoWarsLive.com. We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious

[46:08.600 --> 46:13.000]  to CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department, and the entire Soros crime
[46:13.000 --> 46:16.400]  syndicate. People say why would you start a fight with them? Because they were
[46:16.400 --> 46:20.320]  already dominating and running America into the ground and I knew we had no
[46:20.320 --> 46:24.920]  future if we didn't do this. So we've already had incredible success but if you
[46:24.920 --> 46:29.400]  will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[46:29.400 --> 46:33.480]  why we've been made the main target and if you financially support us and if
[46:33.480 --> 46:38.480]  you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just
[46:38.480 --> 46:43.560]  continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win. We have huge sales

[46:54.200 --> 46:58.240]  financially, Soros and Global Spain win. This is InfoWars Darkness Hour. We're
[46:58.240 --> 47:03.840]  here to see your support. I'm counting on you.
[47:28.560 --> 47:34.400]  Awakening America and the globe, the threat of corporate fascism in the
[47:34.400 --> 47:42.360]  form of globalism, carrying out a technocracy agenda. It wasn't until about
[47:42.360 --> 47:49.280]  five years ago at Davos that Michael Bloomberg, David Rockefeller and others
[47:49.280 --> 47:54.200]  began to say we are a technocracy and we're establishing a private world
[47:54.200 --> 47:58.960]  government. Exactly what I was saying, because they had secretive white papers
[47:58.960 --> 48:03.080]  because their documents had leaked over the years. Barry Goldwater first
[48:03.080 --> 48:07.240]  exposed it. Carol Quigley wrote about it and thought it was a great idea. He was an
[48:07.240 --> 48:10.760]  insider and so all we are is loyal people. It's not like there's some foreign
[48:10.760 --> 48:14.920]  great thing that's better. You know, I mean if Switzerland wanted to merge with
[48:14.920 --> 48:19.360]  us, I'd be all for it. It's the unelected EU and it's here now, but let's shift
[48:19.360 --> 48:24.120]  years into Russia because that's how they try to discredit nationalists.
[48:24.120 --> 48:29.160]  Trying to bring their country back and exposing Hillary's criminal activity in
[48:29.160 --> 48:33.800]  the WikiLeaks with Russia, with China and others. How do you change the subject
[48:33.800 --> 48:39.440]  that Robert Mueller is involved delivering uranium weapons grade, most
[48:39.440 --> 48:42.560]  weapons grade ever, they were saying to the Russians secretly to show all the
[48:42.560 --> 48:47.080]  good stuff Hillary was ready to sell them. Preason, you change it to Donald
[48:47.080 --> 48:51.440]  Trump and Donald Jr. and Roger Stone and now Alex Jones and Dr. Corsi. You know,
[48:51.440 --> 48:54.280]  we've been on Corsi because they've been to the grand jury over and over again
[48:54.280 --> 48:58.840]  and the media was saying, he was saying, you know, that Roger, you know, did all
[48:58.840 --> 49:02.000]  this, but it turned out never said any of it. So Corsi says he's now going to be
[49:02.000 --> 49:10.080]  indicted. There is, of course he's a hero, there is a video exclusive of OAN on
[49:10.080 --> 49:15.360]  infowars.com where they got in to the Justice Department. Obviously Trump's
[49:15.360 --> 49:20.440]  now allowing this. You know, Fox has the info. They're too scared to do it. That's
[49:20.440 --> 49:25.240]  how controlled they are. And they show the documents that that that Rosenstein
[49:25.240 --> 49:29.680]  gave Trump a month ago when Trump came out and said Rosenstein says it's over,
[49:29.680 --> 49:34.280]  no collusion. Fine, let's move on, make the country great again, which everybody
[49:34.280 --> 49:38.040]  already knew, but there it is. But later now Mueller's trying to end it, but with
[49:38.040 --> 49:42.000]  a few process indictments to make it look like there was something at the
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.880]  bottom of the rabbit hole. Will it be Corsi? He thinks yes. Will it be Roger
[49:46.880 --> 49:51.560]  Stone? Hell, it might be me. Who knows, man. They have congressional hearings saying
[49:51.560 --> 49:56.320]  I'm a Russian agent with no proof. We're at CIA and Defense Department hearings
[49:56.320 --> 50:01.160]  at the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and I'm not allowed to be a
[50:01.160 --> 50:05.040]  speaker and defend myself. Public hearings. You've seen the clips. This is in
[50:05.040 --> 50:10.240]  America. They are the traitors saying that. They are the ones that hate America.
[50:10.240 --> 50:16.400]  Not absolutely rabid pro-America people like me. I'm a foaming at the mouth pit
[50:16.400 --> 50:20.480]  bowl for America. My whole family, since the damn thing started, may flower both
[50:20.480 --> 50:25.800]  sides. Founded Texas, 100% pedigree. You cannot be more American than me. It's
[50:25.800 --> 50:30.040]  a fact. I'm not bragging. But the idea to say that I am a traitor is the most
[50:30.040 --> 50:35.200]  asinine manure the planet has ever been fed. I'm sorry the Pope says drop all
[50:35.200 --> 50:38.680]  pedophile investigations and pedophilia is good and tells people you know you're
[50:38.680 --> 50:41.680]  lucky to be gay. You're lucky priests raped the hell out of you. That's in the news
[50:41.680 --> 50:46.560]  today. Now being raped is gay. So don't don't don't talk about it. Excuse me
[50:46.560 --> 50:50.080]  gentlemen. I'm gonna stop ranting in this segment the next. I'm just so you know
[50:50.080 --> 50:53.720]  the quickening is amazing. This OAN report. I'm gonna play later. It's on
[50:53.720 --> 50:58.080]  enforce.com is just you always use the word extraordinary. It's extraordinary.
[50:58.080 --> 51:01.760]  Roger, Tyler Nixon, this whole thing's coming to a head. Everything's coming to
[51:01.760 --> 51:11.600]  a head as Trump begins to take the gloves off. The WikiLeaks collaboration. Where
[51:11.600 --> 51:16.920]  is any evidence whatsoever or proof that I knew about the source or content of
[51:16.920 --> 51:22.200]  the allegedly stolen or hacked emails published by WikiLeaks? It simply doesn't
[51:22.200 --> 51:27.520]  exist. So now they're trying to jack Jerry Corsi, maybe me, maybe others up on
[51:27.520 --> 51:35.280]  some bogus frame of a of a process crime. And with all these Democrats jumping
[51:35.280 --> 51:39.680]  up and down saying the attacking the acting Attorney General should recuse
[51:39.680 --> 51:45.640]  himself from oversight of the Mueller probe because of his previous political
[51:45.640 --> 51:51.400]  opinions. It's really ludicrous. Tyler's had a more direct experience with the
[51:51.400 --> 51:56.520]  Mueller grand jury. I think he can tell us about it. Yeah, absolutely. Well, the
[51:56.520 --> 52:00.480]  whole thing started with the FBI contacting me out of the blue literally
[52:00.480 --> 52:04.760]  one week to the day before I went in and testified. So they were very quick to
[52:04.760 --> 52:08.920]  move things along. They wanted me in there. And by the way, Alex and Roger,
[52:08.920 --> 52:13.080]  the one of the FBI agents when I mentioned posting the video of Randy
[52:13.080 --> 52:18.200]  Kredico basically denying or excuse me saying that he was the intermediary. And
[52:18.200 --> 52:21.320]  I asked if they saw it. They said, no, but we did see that video of you and
[52:21.320 --> 52:26.440]  Roger Stone and Alex Jones at the range last year. So they watch that one
[52:26.440 --> 52:30.960]  of us firing up targets. But at any rate, Robert Mueller, you know, this whole
[52:30.960 --> 52:35.720]  thing, he worked at a law firm called Wilmer Hale. One of the attorneys there
[52:35.720 --> 52:40.080]  at Wilmer Hale, who's been in a revolving door Justice Department position,
[52:40.080 --> 52:45.160]  is someone named Jeannie Rhee. Now, I knew Ms. Rhee to be someone who had
[52:45.160 --> 52:49.840]  worked for Hillary Clinton directly as her attorney representing her in the
[52:49.840 --> 52:56.160]  email, some of these lawsuits involving email, the her email missing emails
[52:56.160 --> 53:01.120]  the 35,000 missing emails. This is around 2015. She also represented the
[53:01.120 --> 53:05.280]  Clinton Foundation defending them against racketeering. So I knew that there to be
[53:05.280 --> 53:09.920]  the FBI to FBI agents and a an assistant U.S. attorney who I was going to be
[53:09.920 --> 53:14.040]  interviewing with immediately prior to testifying to the grand jury. Now, they
[53:14.040 --> 53:18.120]  kept saying prosecutors when they referred to the interview meeting in
[53:18.120 --> 53:21.640]  advance, but they never said who was who was going to be. So I go to there with my
[53:21.640 --> 53:26.600]  attorney and sit down and who walks in Jeannie Rhee and introduces herself. You
[53:26.600 --> 53:30.680]  know, it gave me serious pause. I always couldn't believe it. I, you know,
[53:30.680 --> 53:34.560]  this is this is the attack dog of Hillary Clinton. This is her
[53:34.560 --> 53:40.120]  kraken. This is her. This is her political assassin. This is her water bearer, her
[53:40.120 --> 53:44.840]  groom of the stool. Yeah, this is the one who defended her against all the types
[53:44.840 --> 53:49.400]  of legal actions concerning her elimination of thousands and tens of
[53:49.400 --> 53:53.680]  thousands of emails. Now, it's not a matter of like this was the attorney for
[53:53.680 --> 53:57.400]  Hillary concerning some side thing. And, you know, the fact that she was her
[53:57.400 --> 54:01.720]  attorney makes, you know, negligible difference either way. No, she was her
[54:01.720 --> 54:05.840]  attorney concerning cybersecurity, concerning leaks, concerning questions
[54:05.840 --> 54:10.440]  about how she handled, you know, her electronic accounts and so forth. Meaning
[54:10.440 --> 54:14.400]  like Jeannie Rhee might have information in the common confidential basis with
[54:14.400 --> 54:19.040]  Hillary Clinton as to sloppiness, incompetence, the possibility that maybe it
[54:19.040 --> 54:23.480]  wasn't hacked. Maybe there was a leak involved or maybe it was as Roger Stone
[54:23.480 --> 54:27.240]  has said repeatedly over and over, walked out the back door after having been
[54:27.240 --> 54:30.800]  downloaded to a thumb drive as validated by Bill Binney, who said that the
[54:30.800 --> 54:34.760]  transfer speeds of like 30 megabits per second were physically impossible to
[54:34.760 --> 54:38.600]  have gone over the encrypted networks or the networks that they claimed in order
[54:38.600 --> 54:43.120]  to go back to Russia. So anyway, Ms. Rhee walks in, you know, it's, it's, it's
[54:43.120 --> 54:45.800]  speaking of break points, it's a point at which to say, what do I do?
[54:45.800 --> 54:49.880]  Hillary Clinton walks into the grand jury. It's like Hillary Clinton is running
[54:49.880 --> 54:55.360]  the prosecution. That's right. And Robert Mueller's law firm partner. So, you know,
[54:55.360 --> 54:58.920]  this little insane double Yale, both, you know, I mean, you want to look at the
[54:58.920 --> 55:03.160]  number of Yale attorneys who are after Roger Stone, after Donald Trump, after
[55:03.160 --> 55:07.120]  you, Alex, I mean, it's like, it's like, you know, what's with Yale? I mean, my God,
[55:07.120 --> 55:10.360]  it's, it's gotta be a, it's a blight on this country with the people it's
[55:10.360 --> 55:14.440]  producing, the radicals that it's turning out, the armies and hordes of lawyers
[55:14.440 --> 55:18.160]  who are suit, you know, bringing these frivolous lawsuits to try to tie everyone
[55:18.160 --> 55:21.680]  up. You know what? This is the essential point here. I thought about it as I sat
[55:21.680 --> 55:25.480]  there trying to weed through all of this minutiae, this hair splitting that these
[55:25.480 --> 55:29.960]  Ivy League attorneys working for this, you know, this hit squad. And by the way,
[55:29.960 --> 55:34.120]  I'd like to say the FBI agents and the assistant US attorney were exemplary. I
[55:34.120 --> 55:37.680]  will say that the people who are working at the lower levels are patriots and good
[55:37.680 --> 55:41.880]  people from everything I saw. They were courteous, professional, and just trying
[55:41.880 --> 55:44.840]  to do their jobs. And you could see that they were exhausted of it just as much as
[55:44.840 --> 55:49.480]  probably anybody else who's the target of these investigations. And it's a classic
[55:49.480 --> 55:53.920]  witch hunt when you've got the witch in bed with the, anybody that'll pay her.
[55:53.960 --> 55:57.800]  She's in bed with over 100 countries selling us out. And there's the witch.
[55:57.800 --> 56:02.880]  There she is. You're looking for one. Good Lord. It's evil, evil projects itself
[56:02.880 --> 56:06.760]  onto you, accuses you of its sins. And what they're trying to do, Alex, and
[56:06.760 --> 56:10.400]  Roger knows this all too well, and unfortunately, been successful to some
[56:10.400 --> 56:15.480]  extent is they're trying to tie our hands and have us arguing over a tertiary
[56:15.480 --> 56:20.880]  level, laughable. You didn't say this, you know, hair splitting semantics to bring
[56:20.880 --> 56:24.680]  process charges to have attorneys and people like me who are having to beat
[56:24.680 --> 56:28.640]  this back rather than fighting them offensively, rather than fighting for
[56:28.680 --> 56:32.240]  reforms in government. Let's try Tyler Nixon stay there, Roger Stone stay there.
[56:32.240 --> 56:36.000]  We're going to come back and then we have a special guest coming in studio. I want
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.960]  to come back and then shift gears, what you're predicting or gut level, what you
[56:39.960 --> 56:42.720]  think is about to happen. Trump's been told it's being wrapped up. Nothing was
[56:42.720 --> 56:46.000]  found. Those documents have been leaked confirming what Trump said a month ago
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.680]  that the article is on info wars dot com. We'll also look at Kelly and his
[56:49.680 --> 56:54.440]  reported girlfriend, a Trump set to fire Kelly and his girlfriend in the next few
[56:54.440 --> 56:59.440]  days. That that information is exclusive. It's well known in DC that the head of
[56:59.440 --> 57:05.240]  DHS that Kelly brought in is his main, his main girl. We're nothing wrong with
[57:05.240 --> 57:08.160]  that except that it causes a conflict of interest and Kelly's not been
[57:08.160 --> 57:12.120]  executing like the president wants him to show. We're about to see more heads
[57:12.120 --> 57:16.360]  rolling. Oh, stick with the plan. QAnon just went down the toilet again.
[57:16.400 --> 57:21.760]  Info wars proven right again. Globalist snoop groups, disinfo ops proven wrong

[59:49.640 --> 59:56.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:59.480 --> 01:00:07.880]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:16.160]  Mark Dice is joining us in the next hour, this hour. You've got a very
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.400]  special guest who's going to be in studio Katie Hopkins, Katie Hopkins on
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:26.360]  Twitter, Hopkinsworld.com. And then I've just got, you've got to stay tuned for
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:30.200]  this broadcast and you've got it later when we upload it to infowars.com. The
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:33.640]  audio in the video, you got to get it out to people because I haven't even got
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:38.520]  into the news yet. It is what's happening in Israel and they're already at war
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:44.880]  with Hezbollah. We've got the total election fraud continuing a week later.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:50.480]  Democrats are just stealing everything. Any close races, all the fake ballots they
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.280]  need are being produced or even getting caught. That doesn't matter. It's all
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:01:00.040]  happening. Gentlemen, how do you see this all ending? Because Trump finally gets
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.600]  the fact that the globalists don't want prosperity. They want to destroy him. And
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.800]  then he's been lied to by a bunch of double dealing cowards. He's about to
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:09.960]  remove them. The rush of things, the total fraud, but the Democrats don't seem to
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.080]  care. The deep state doesn't seem to care. So the immovable object in this
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:19.160]  Kabul force, what's going to happen here? Well, I can't really say I do know
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.400]  that they're trying to destroy me financially. They're trying to drive my
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:28.600]  family to bankruptcy because I refuse to fold. I am not going to plead guilty to
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:34.200]  some bogus crime, particularly perjury that I am not guilty of. I've committed
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.760]  no offense in connection with the 2016 election. I'm being persecuted because I
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.680]  appear on info wars. I'm being persecuted because I supported Donald Trump for
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:48.840]  president. I'm being persecuted because I was effective in the defeat of Hillary
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:54.160]  Clinton. This is, as the president says, a witch hunt. And I think Mr. Muller is
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:58.840]  running out of time. And he now has oversight from a real attorney general
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:03.320]  who's committed to the rule of law. Beyond that, I can't speculate.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:08.240]  What should Trump do right now? Because I know the governor a week, five days
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.320]  ago in Florida ordered them to impound the ballots. They're not doing that.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.280]  They're just showing up with more totally illegally.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:19.000]  Well, you've got several things going on at once. First of all, we have a
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.640]  recount on, but if any county fails to complete the recount, which is an
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:29.440]  arduous process by the deadline, then the numbers they reported on election
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:35.240]  night stand. That would appear to benefit the Republicans. Yet in Broward
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:40.680]  County, specifically, votes that have been disallowed by the election board,
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:47.560]  as not valid, are now being counted. And Republican observers are being
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:53.320]  denied access to the recount process in violation of the state sunshine law.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:03:00.480]  So this is up for grabs. The real hero here is Republican Attorney General
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:06.400]  Pam Bondi, who has directed the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:11.240]  the Secretary of State to investigate those two infractions that I just
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:11.680]  mentioned.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.720]  Tyler, put a cherry on top of the situation for us.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:21.400]  I think the Democrats securing of the House of Representatives will prove
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:26.320]  to, in short, Donald Trump's reelection as president in 2020. I think they
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.480]  will lose seats and there will be a reversal because people will see that
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:34.200]  they stand for nothing that they're all interested in doing is basically
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:41.040]  hatred and street violence and endorsing and abetting, essentially, sedition
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.280]  and these types of un-American activities that I think the bulk of
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.040]  America, the bulk of Americans, regardless of this election results, do
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.680]  not support and will not support and will not very long tolerate in this
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:57.080]  country. And I think that we will see our own forces continue to expand and
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:01.560]  grow as the Democrats launch their, you know, whatever you want to call it,
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:05.040]  investigation, or Rama, where they don't stand for anything except literally
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.720]  just constantly hounding the man in charge, the man in the arena. And I
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.200]  think Donald Trump, if he's able to, if he's able to keep his cool and not
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.480]  get too wrapped up in the attempts of people like Adam Schiff and these
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.480]  other little henpecking nothings who, you know, in future, President Eric
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:26.960]  Swalwell, right? Yeah, sure. If he maintains his cool and we all continue to
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:31.160]  plow forward, I think we're gonna see victory in 2020 and beyond and the
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:35.040]  Democrats are gonna collapse into oblivion where they belong. That's right
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.720]  and, you know, just like your ancestor, Richard Nixon, should have been on the
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:41.200]  offense earlier. Trump must go on the offense now or they are going to
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:45.040]  destroy him because he is for this country and he is delivering and they
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:48.600]  are literally enemies of this country and work for the globalist and hate
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.600]  America. That is their official policy. Thank you, gentlemen. We'll be back with
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.560]  Katie Hopkins and more. Stay with us.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:02.000]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.640]  censorship and you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.720]  info wars. Yes, some of them are like little side accounts. They know we had
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:12.560]  like info or store that just showed our products, but they just banned them all
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.920]  yesterday in punishment that I be in a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:20.280]  folks that loved us. Your excitement about America, your excitement about this
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:23.640]  broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the break. But the
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:27.880]  globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:33.000]  pesky in the future. I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.480]  going. I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially. I
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:42.080]  want to push all the way. I've committed to do that. I've prayed for that and I've
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:45.720]  been told that's going to happen, but you've got a back-ish and I promise you
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:50.120]  this. I will never falter. I will never waiver at the spiritual level. I
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.520]  physically will, but I give you my commitment. If you financially support
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.840]  us at foreshore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:14.840]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:39.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us. Katie Hopkins, syndicated radio
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:43.560]  host, TV host. They have government funded plays in the UK, calling for her
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:47.600]  murder. She's going to be in studio with us about five minutes to the next hour.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.400]  Then Mark Dice is going to be with us as well. He's got a new book out. A lot of
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:55.760]  other big developments. Very excited about that. And then PJW, from England,
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:59.640]  always a heavy hitter. He's going to be hosting the fourth hour ahead of the
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:03.760]  war room with Owen Schreuer and Roger Stone today. Everything is coming to
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:11.520]  a head. We just joined us. There is a huge One News American Network, OAN, One
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:15.680]  American News Network video, special report where they got in to the
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.560]  Justice Department or showed the documents that Trump talked about a month
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:23.480]  ago. No evidence of Russia collusion, Mueller's investigation is coming to an
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:28.280]  end, but they want some fake indictments for perjury. That is huge. That is on
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:33.120]  info wars.com and news wars.com. Trump is pointing out the Democrats are
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.040]  trying to implode the economy, working as hard as they can, saying they're going
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:41.360]  to bring back the regulations that brought the jobs back. And so Trump's
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:45.360]  right when he says they're the ones killing the economy. Stock market, you
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.720]  know, plunged last week and yesterday has come back up some because they're
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:52.560]  saying they want to hurt the economy to hurt Trump. I mean, Democrats say it on
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:58.040]  the news. Bill Maher says it. It's just true sabotage against the nation. And
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:01.440]  then I'm going to read from the Constitution because the Democrats are
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:08.680]  now filing suits and saying that Trump can't fire an attorney general and then
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:13.360]  bring in one for confirmation when it's in the Constitution. So next level
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:18.200]  disinfo. The popes come out and said stop investigations into pedophilia and
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:23.520]  don't have a vote by the Cardinals to call for it. Cover it up because he is up
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:29.080]  to his eyeballs in it. Vatican orders US bishops to postpone crucial vote on
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:34.200]  sexual abuse claims. It's totally public. It's admitted. It is unbelievable. Some
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:38.800]  of it including satanic rituals. Just like we've seen this pop up over and
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:42.200]  over and over and over again. Seeing it as we told you days ago has now sued
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.440]  President Trump and his top aides saying you can't kick them out of the
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:49.640]  White House. They lobbied to have our press credentials pulled, which was
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:56.680]  done a year and a half ago. They are just monsters. They are monsters. They
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:02.920]  are unbelievable. They call for deplatforming, banning all conservatives,
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:06.120]  not letting conservatives have political advertising. And then they're going
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.480]  to have hearings in two months when they get into office in January. And they've
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:15.400]  said publicly that they're going to have hearings on the attack on the first
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:18.840]  amendment when it's Obama that sent hundreds of journalists and whistle
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:23.720]  blowers to prison. And Trump has done no such thing. These people are monsters
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:28.600]  and they are murdering the truth big time. Just like they're stealing the
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.800]  election endangering our Republic. There's a very important report on
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:36.280]  info wars dot com by Harrison Smith. What's happening in Florida threatens to
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:39.240]  collapse our Republic. The Democrats have gotten away with so much. They're
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.120]  stealing it all over the nation. You thought the election ended a week ago.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:45.760]  They're taking more and more house seats, Senate seats, gubernatorial seats
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:52.920]  everywhere. Last night in Arizona, clear fraud. We are dealing with criminals
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:57.600]  making their move. America has not rejected Trump. They the Democrats are
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:02.360]  involved in massive fraud to the next level to block it. We're going to air
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:06.080]  this special report by John Bowne dealing with the global treason, our
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.160]  media that's globalist media says it's treason if Trump says we a nation
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.480]  exist. Macron says the same thing now while he establishes an EU army to not
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.200]  let nation states leave who never voted to enter it. They're even threatening an
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:24.040]  EU army against the UK with Brexit. Wow, these really are incredible times
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.280]  we're living in. It's all happening in front of us. So here's John Bowne's
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:32.360]  report. We'll come back with Katie Hopkins in studio. I'm Alex Jones in
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.800]  full wars dot com tomorrow's news today. It can be a difficult dilemma
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:41.720]  explaining where you stand as an American. The rampant betrayal has driven
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:46.480]  many away from a Congress with what is better described as a high disapproval
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:51.760]  rating. So when President Trump echoed the core beliefs of a majority of
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:57.480]  Americans as president of the United States, I will always put America
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:04.960]  first, just like you as the leaders of your countries will always and should
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:11.280]  always put your countries first. Well, you say nationalism. I actually call it
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:16.680]  nationalism. We believe in the nation state. That is the unit we identify
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:21.600]  with. That is what we feel part of. That is what we cheer for in the Olympics.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:27.160]  And if necessary, that is what we're prepared to fight for. It embodies our
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:31.840]  values, our families, our communities, our heritage, our identity.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:39.360]  A globalist is a person that wants the globe to do well, frankly, not caring
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:44.000]  about our country so much. And you know what? We can't have that. You know,
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.480]  they have a word. It sort of became old fashioned. It's called a nationalist.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:53.080]  And I say, really, we're not supposed to use that word. You know what I am?
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:57.960]  I'm a nationalist. Okay. It's obvious that nationalism seemed a simple
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:02.360]  explanation for where most Americans stand against the creeping tide of
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:07.400]  globalism, protection of our values, security and future against the efforts
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:12.040]  of international bankers and world government. However, the conniving
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:16.800]  mainstream media saw yet another opportunity to smear the president and
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.800]  anyone that agrees with shocking. It is. We have a president who calls
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:27.480]  himself a nationalist nationalist, a loaded word for a lot of people. But
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:32.640]  the president dismissed any concern about it and sitting at his desk in the
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:38.520]  Oval Office defended the new label he is using for himself. I love our country
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.880]  and our country has taken second fiddle. There is a concern that you are
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:48.000]  sending coded language or a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.200]  you really mean is that you're a white nationalist. I've never even heard that.
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.160]  I cannot imagine that you mean I'm a nationalist. I never heard that theory
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:00.200]  about being a nationalist. So now the Trump campaign has disavowed William
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:05.560]  Johnson and the white nationalist party that he runs, but that has not stopped
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:09.440]  William Johnson from remaining a big time fan of Donald Trump. President
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:13.320]  Trump has a ton of support from white nationalists and that's a very
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:17.440]  different thing. Marion Webster's definition defines a white nationalist as
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:22.400]  one of a group of militant whites who espouse white supremacy and advocate
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:27.040]  and forced racial segregation. Even in Los Angeles where white nationalist
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:31.160]  William Johnson was elated with President Trump's press conference. I think
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:35.160]  there's blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and you don't have any
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:41.360]  doubt about it either. He is the most honest president since George Washington
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:45.200]  and the cherry tree. On the campaign trial you called yourself a nationalist.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:48.800]  Some people saw that as emboldening white nationalists. Now people are also
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.720]  saying it's such a racist question. There are some people that say that now the
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.320]  Republican Party is seen as supporting white nationalists because of your rhetoric.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.520]  What do you make of that? I don't believe. I just well I don't know why do I have my
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.160]  highest poll numbers ever with African Americans. What do I have among the
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:07.440]  highest poll numbers? Honestly I mean I know you have it written down and you're
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:12.240]  gonna tell me. Let me tell you. It's a racist question. They're assaulting reality.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:17.920]  We pay taxes. It's our nation. We have a system. We're proud of it. We protect our
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:22.200]  power globally. They go no, no, no. You can't have a country. We got to come in
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:28.200]  and take this over right now. Who's taking it over? The IMF, the World Bank, the UN,
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:34.840]  the UN Human Rights Commission run by Saudi Arabia and China? It's like having
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.720]  Hitler run your local synagogue. And as populism becomes increasingly under
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:44.400]  attack, it came as no surprise that French President Macron, mouthpiece of
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:48.320]  the globalists, chose to sour the commemoration of the Armistice Day
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:53.960]  Centennial Observance in Paris with propaganda. Macron stated patriotism is
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:59.880]  the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism.
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:05.920]  In saying our interests first, whatever happens to the others, you erase the most
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:10.880]  precious thing a nation can have, that which makes it live, that which causes
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:16.160]  it to be great, and that which is most important, its moral values. But Macron
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:21.040]  didn't even bother to look up nationalism. Nationalism is described as a
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:26.920]  patriotic feeling. An extreme form of this is especially marked by a feeling of
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:32.280]  superiority over other countries. Nationalism advocates political independence
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:38.320]  for a particular country. So nationalism on its face is simply the opposite of
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:44.080]  globalism, not the opposite of patriotism. There is no betrayal by American
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.760]  citizens here, but the desperation infused in the propaganda of the globalist
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:54.000]  knows no limits. Twisting the meaning of words and reality on an international
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.760]  stage, this is a very dangerous thing. The United States of Empire is a book that
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:04.880]  claims the United States is the Empire of the World. George Washington had warned
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:09.640]  us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that World Wars
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:15.800]  I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the Empire.
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:21.280]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I,
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:26.720]  the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:31.840]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:37.680]  ransacked the place. And what they don't steal will be destroyed. This year,
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:42.880]  resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in. Go to faketv.com and discover a
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:47.000]  device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.520]  you're miles away. Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:55.120]  security solution. Be vigilant, but not fearful.

[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.080]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:05.080]  food and boil water. If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.040]  cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way. The Minuteman Rocket
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.200]  Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:16.320]  sticks and twigs for fuel. The Minuteman Stove is easy to use,
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:20.000]  smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable. For the finest in survival

[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:15.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.760]  Well I'm really excited to have Katie Hopkins in studio weather. She's also
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:46.520]  going to be on the war room today and I'm going to be interviewed for her show.
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:51.080]  She has Hopkinsworld.com. She also does reporting for Fox News. She of course
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:55.880]  has been a big popular writer for major British newspapers with some of her
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.840]  videos getting tens of millions of views and that's why she's become so fired
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:03.240]  just like InfoWars. If you're popular and you're not saying what they want to
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:07.000]  hear, they're standing up for sovereignty and capitalism and you don't want
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.160]  you know Islamic acid attacks or grooming of kidnapped little girls. Well
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.040]  you're bad you've got to be taken off the air but now she's come to America but
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:18.800]  who knows how long we'll have free speech here as well. So Katie Hopkins you
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:21.840]  were during the break that you were really saying some incredibly important
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.760]  things the way you were tying it together so it's good to have you here and
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.840]  please please please do it again. Thank you very much indeed. It's really good to
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:32.040]  be here and it's really good to be here in studio with you as well. We've talked
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:35.520]  a number of times but it's good to finally meet a lot of the team members as
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:39.560]  well but one of the things that's really striking for me I've been out in LA for
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:43.240]  the last week or so with the midterms one of the things that's really striking
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:47.440]  for me is the way that here in the States now you know that watching
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:53.800]  democracy be overturned so in Florida the surprising result in Arizona watching
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:58.440]  people overturn what seems to be a democratic vote and how that ties in
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:03.880]  with Brexit where 17.4 million people voted for something that probably will
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:07.760]  never see either and it's kind of this idea of what what do people expect they
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:13.720]  they scrap the the idea of the true family they remove your true identity of
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:17.720]  your country by flooding it with people from another place and then they tell
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:20.920]  you to vote you vote and then they tell you your vote doesn't count or your vote
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:24.440]  doesn't matter or they just found some more ballots so funnily enough you're
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:27.960]  not getting the guy that you voted for you know what at what point do they
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:33.760]  expect people to still be able to believe in a system or the country they
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:38.640]  belong to you know we're trashing so much of what structures our lives and
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:44.080]  makes our lives feel like they have worth and value and it's a global system
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:48.080]  we have our our controlled media saying Trump's evil you can't say we're a
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:51.640]  nation a nation existing is bad you can't even have borders it's bad
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:56.160]  Macron comes out and says it when it was the VC French that signed on to Hitler
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:01.680]  and the original EU plan and here he is this trader saying that the Brits are
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:05.640]  bad or the UK's bad for wanting to get out of something you never voted to get
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:09.920]  into you voted three years ago to leave and they won't let you leave and then
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:13.800]  magically it's happening here again so the truth is the people are rejecting
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:19.480]  globalism and tyranny but it's become a tyranny so let's walk through some of
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:23.640]  the parallels there because we're dealing whether it's the UK or whether it's
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:28.440]  Brazil or whether it's the US all of us are trying to get self-determination back
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:34.080]  from the modern corporate colonialism the globalism yeah absolutely and I
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:37.800]  think one of the things we see every time so if I think about Brexit you know
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:42.520]  we had the Brexit vote leave one people like myself you know it was the best day
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:48.840]  ever the 23rd of June 2016 the best night because we had we heard had our
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:53.120]  voices heard for the first time you know this lovely country I come from a place
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:57.560]  called the rest of the UK you know the UK is divided into two places there's
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:02.160]  London and there's this other great place called the rest of the UK we had
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:06.800]  our voices heard for once and we celebrated and ever since that night
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:11.960]  ever since that win it's been a court case to try and stop Brexit it's been
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:15.320]  why we need to have another vote there's this huge campaign called the
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:19.840]  people's vote which is a second referendum and we've already voted once
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:23.000]  but they want us to vote again because we came up with the wrong answer and
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.120]  watching this unfold in Florida as well where these ballot boxes provisional
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:32.200]  ballots are turning up and it's a famous county that's deep that tries to
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:36.440]  steal any close election statewide yeah of course and it's unbelievable that
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:41.480]  somebody who's already been found guilty of election fraud is still there
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:45.480]  running this thing it's unbelievable you have people trying to cover up for
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:49.480]  election boxes ballot boxes turning up you know at airports in the back of
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:53.400]  cars by calling it a bomb I mean it's a craziness it's a madness that we're
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:57.640]  suffering from and it strikes me that America was always you know we all hold
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:02.440]  America up as this kind of because you have the Constitution we hold you up as
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:08.040]  this ambassador of democracy this the leader of the free world well our
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:12.960]  societal contract is based on this idea that we have law and order and it's
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:17.040]  being broken we comply to it because we have our vote you want to take away my
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:21.600]  vote why am I now societally contracted into to obey law and order you know we
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.600]  are really messing with the system here and let's talk about that because it's
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:28.720]  like you read my mind I was literally about to say the social contract is
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.360]  broken and then you said it because it's prima facie we're not reading each
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:36.200]  other's minds it's the truth we're seeing the same thing and we've done our
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:40.680]  research but if you look at what they're doing clearly there's election fraud the
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:44.480]  Democrats are saying let illegal aliens vote we're catching them all over
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:49.520]  Texas all over the country voting the names of dead people project Veritas
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:56.560]  gets the undercover video of all this and then they say oh the Trump election is
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:00.920]  illegitimate the Russians did it with no proof we have them violating and
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:05.320]  stealing elections with total proof but they say it's illegitimate and fascist
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:09.360]  and dangerous that Trump is saying there's clearly fraud this is upside
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:12.440]  down world there's not even congruency that they're saying it's good to
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:17.240]  challenge elections with no proof but with total proof it's bad and there's
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.560]  another thing as well so not only do I see the parallels stretching from Western
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:26.800]  Europe or Britain to America in terms of the overturning of a popular vote as it
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:29.280]  appears to be happening in Florida certainly I believe it's happened in
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:33.040]  Arizona personally absolutely because of the incongruity between the numbers
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:37.360]  but I think the other thing that's really alarming to me as an outsider it's
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:41.840]  the reason I spend so much time here in America is watching people vote
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:46.560]  according to religion so for the first time you've had two Muslim females
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:50.800]  elected and they're going to be going to Congress and explain that oh great you
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:54.680]  but they always vote as a block and then that's why they're so key yeah and
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:58.080]  that's the parallel that I would draw so we're a long way down that you know the
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:03.040]  UK has fallen we're a long way down the dark path to some kind of holy first
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:09.840]  they take your identity then they bring in a absolute tyrannical system that
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:13.160]  votes monolithically there's no way you can stand against it well I think you
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:16.640]  know there's a sort of the stages you can easily see them mapped out so what
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:22.400]  you do is you flood an area with a one a monoculture the Muslim population you'll
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:26.240]  see houses change they used to have a single doorbell and now they have four
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:29.840]  or five doorbells because they become multiple occupancy homes you've got five
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:33.320]  families where they used to be one and that one family leave because they don't
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:35.720]  know where they are anymore because they're surrounded by a different culture
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:39.920]  what you have a Muslim population they vote according to religion because
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:43.520]  religion is the number one thing in their lives and that means they vote how
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.840]  their political imam tells them correct so you have a political imam you see
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:50.560]  those mosques building up where of course a political Islam is pushed and
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:55.120]  then you will see the baton being handed over from one Muslim to another so it's
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:59.080]  a new kind of you know in our country we used to have this kind of generation or
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:02.880]  this aristocracy that used to pass down whether that was right or wrong that's
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:07.440]  how power you've traded one out that gave us the Magna Carta and gave us the
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:12.200]  Renaissance with one that gave us sex slavery and math death you have a new
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:15.840]  kind of succession planning going on right here in America in Minnesota in
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:19.920]  Michigan I've spent a lot of time there trying to warn people but once you start
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:23.200]  passing that baton from one Muslim leader to another which you've done with
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:26.560]  Keith Ellison straight over to the next one who married potentially allegedly
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:29.160]  married her brother and we're gonna talk about this because this is key they are
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:33.840]  totally monotheistic a monoculture let no one else in and that's all that's good
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:39.200]  and liberal but everything Christian or Western just the idea of liking the
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:43.440]  lesson it works well even not a Christian that's supposed to be thrown down the
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:47.760]  rat hole into the garbage this is totally sick and it's totally planned
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:52.240]  Kenny Hopkins is on fire in studio spread the live links and tell folks
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:56.720]  about local stations to get around the sensors it's a mission
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:01.400]  what if there was a social media network only for the conservative what if
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:04.720]  there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:08.280]  public but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:12.520]  and what if the social media network was the only free speech network in
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:17.760]  existence there is it's right social net right social net a response to
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:21.840]  president Donald Trump's direct presidential order right social net where

[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:38.520]  I'm watching the midterms then you would think our country is Mad Max
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:42.680]  Thunderdome this guy is like they're coming from Guatemala they're coming
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:34:09.440]  from Mexico there's a liberal mob that's coming
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:30.920]  and then you would think everybody in the countries is like to the bunker
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:41.320]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:49.080]  lines of the info war so Katie Hopkins of Hopkins World Fox news contributor they
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:53.600]  have government-sponsored plays in the UK calling for her death called the
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:57.480]  assassination of Katie Hopkins this is par for the course of these people's like
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:00.200]  they call for violence here and then said that we're calling for violence so
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.880]  they said that President Trump is attacking the press when he points out
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:08.680]  they're lying about him and then they're calling for me to be taken off the air
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:12.880]  and lobbying successfully to do it on over a hundred platforms and now they
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:17.520]  want our banking now they want our software now they're contacting the
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:21.760]  software we use for the websites and saying revoke the right to software to
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:28.640]  contract this is war Katie Hopkins was getting into the the the globalist plan
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:32.680]  the admitted UN plan to flood Europe with incompatible monoculture of Islam
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:37.280]  where they literally sell women into sex slavery in North Africa now aiding the
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:40.880]  collapse of North Africa in the Middle East with the Arab Spring to then flood
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:44.800]  the borders of Europe to then bring in an internal group you're getting into the
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:51.160]  voting the the new Islamic aristocracy the two Islamic women even though in
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:56.080]  their own countries they don't do that being elected to Congress flying their
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:36:03.840]  Palestinian flags at their victory events one of them is a daughter of
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:08.920]  Palestinians and when she was elected to Congress as the first Muslim to be
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:12.920]  elected to Congress you know what flag was it that she got out and what flag
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:17.360]  was it that she decided to fly first of course the Palestinian flag and people
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:21.320]  celebrate because they say wow isn't it fantastic we've got another Muslim woman
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:25.600]  going to Congress but for me of course those are where the warning bells well
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:29.520]  they're not just ringing the whole system I know this system I've lived it in
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.960]  the UK you have a Muslim in power and suddenly the Muslim population of that
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:38.520]  area which is a dense and and a monoculture right there with mosques
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:42.240]  that facilitate them you have them voting according to their religion what
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:46.480]  happens next of course is that police start turning a blind eye you have no
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:52.120]  go zones where police actively don't patrol where black money starts to flow
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:55.960]  in through unregistered mosques I've seen it happen on the street well that
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:37:03.240]  everybody knows that they have in the Islamic culture sex slavery and they
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:07.440]  call it a harem but it's kidnapped women it's kidnapped children and and this is
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:14.160]  the process and Islam is only 1400 years old and there are countries that were
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:20.440]  free now they're Islamic like Turkey was the Eastern Christian Empire it's gone
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:24.560]  now yeah it's the new invasion force so there's the there's the house of Islam
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:27.640]  and there's the house of war outside of there's that but I think there's also
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:32.400]  it's far more sophisticated than that you know I don't really feel so much on
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:36.640]  the female element though clearly that is abhorrent but but when you watch them
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:40.120]  on the streets of Belgium you know there's the garages the car washes
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:45.360]  there's the unofficial mosques and then there's these reception places where
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:49.000]  they pretend to host things but actually it's a way of laundering money the
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.840]  movement of drugs and weapons and money through those areas which are controlled
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:58.600]  by the Muslims where police no longer patrol because the imams control who
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:02.320]  can oh ambulances in mail won't even get delivered in Sweden and Germany yeah
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:07.600]  precisely my point is that the takeover is far more sinister and far more it's
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:11.040]  a takeover of the entire society the culture and their lawless because
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.160]  everyone outside of their culture is the enemy right and where you end up with
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:19.000]  is in Belgium you have the Islam party and that's what you will see in years
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  from now in Minnesota in Michigan there will be the establishment of the Islam
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.760]  party and in Belgium they have two candidates that were elected and their
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:31.880]  policies were segregation on transport and their policies were compulsory
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:36.160]  headscarves for all that's the route that Michigan and Minnesota are headed
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:39.240]  down and that's the route that the Democrats seem to be applauding and as
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:44.560]  an outsider and as a Brit I find it truly alarming and watch the left the name
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:47.760]  of diversity bring in something that's the opposite of diversity is a total
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:54.040]  mono tyranny it's it's mind-blowing it is mind-blowing and you always hope that
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:58.880]  at some point the lizard if I think of Democrats which I prefer to as lizards
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:03.440]  you hope one day that they'll spin so fast that the head will eat the tail you
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:07.080]  know and they'll die from blood loss to the head and when I think of examples of
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:12.080]  this I think of the trans movement where we just had the World Track Cycling
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:16.800]  Championship won by a trans woman who's obviously a former male and now we're
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:19.120]  gonna get to the point where women I think you had it in Connecticut the
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:22.920]  state championships to two of those races the hundred and two hundred let's be
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:27.240]  clear these people still have their testicles yeah I mean these are men and
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:33.120]  they have twice the strength bigger bones more blood less fat I mean men and
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:36.920]  women are different it'd be like brains those smaller brains but well sure and
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:40.480]  we don't have a uterus so so there's a big difference I mean look at this guy
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:44.240]  I mean this is a bit he's not gonna compete against Lance Armstrong
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:48.160]  but when Lance Armstrong enhances his maleness to win that's called cheating
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:52.880]  when this guy goes against girls Alex you got a point out that the lady in the
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:57.560]  middle is called Rachel so just be your viewers to be clear that's cool that
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:02.600]  lady in the middle is called Rachel and one of them one of the women's second
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.440]  place now says she's mad as she was cheated but then they got mad at her so
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:09.000]  she apologized so she wrote back yeah on that but we're now at the point of
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.880]  course where you have to say well the big thing for the liberals or the
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:16.760]  Democrats was women are equal women are all equal well okay but how are we equal
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:21.160]  now if we can't compete how are we equal if we can't run as fast how are we
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:25.240]  equal if men are against us how is that you know this is total mental illness
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:29.240]  yeah it's like in the UK where the guy with a big beard comes in and the nurse
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:33.200]  said a huge you know male genitals and he's got he gets up and says check my
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:38.320]  cervix and then she won't go okay let me cheat he doesn't have a cervix and so
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:42.640]  what she got suspended yeah and we have that with waxing parlors too we have a
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:47.560]  trans individual in Europe who is suing waxing parlors because they wouldn't
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:54.680]  wax him as a female and they're trying to say let adult men who say they're
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:59.240]  women shower with young girls because they'll be the girls coach well let the
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:04.720]  the she's a woman no she's not and Chris Cuomo said it's bigoted if you don't
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:09.680]  want your 12 year old daughter to see a woman's penis I see that's two plus two
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:15.600]  equals whatever that's mental illness a woman's genitals it's true and we have
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:20.320]  men now that identifies women who are now being put in prisons with our female
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:24.280]  population because they now identify as a woman and then we have a we had a
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:28.560]  newspaper report recently where the women in the prison were violated by the
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:32.800]  other lady's penis and that was actually written in a newspaper let's be
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:38.760]  clear a woman rapes another woman with her penis and this is a this is a
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:41.880]  family show this is what they're teaching your five-year-olds right now
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:46.280]  total mental illness but this is societal sabotage you know Tabasco
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:49.600]  Institute cooked all this up you know about yes of course and I'm my you know
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:52.880]  you see so you hope they'll get to a point where even they have to go hold on
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:56.720]  we've got a bit too far with this now with a point that women can't compete in
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:59.880]  a race anymore because men are in the race and that's not good but they still
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:03.840]  don't wake up to it it's almost like they carry on building on the madness to
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:07.640]  the point they still it's the in person who clothes once they get you like
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:11.160]  Hitler did to sign them with something really bad once you've signed on to it
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:14.440]  you'll just keep by approximation and you know the other thing Alex even though
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:20.120]  I would say that you chop the legs off a cat it doesn't become a slug right like
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:25.680]  the analogy goes but I don't even mind if you Alex want to be Alexandra for the
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:28.880]  rest of your life I don't care if you want I don't hate those people but it's

[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:10.120]  that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to

[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:19.320]  permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:22.920]  and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:27.280]  deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:31.720]  incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research

[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:05.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:23.320]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:32.600]  there must be some way out of here say the joker to the theme there's too much
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:42.680]  confusion I can't get no relief business man drink my wine
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:53.080]  we are being conquered by mega corporations that have looked at the
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:57.160]  demographics of six plus billion people in the third world and they're using
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:02.280]  miss weapons and then macron is repeating the EU project that literally was
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:06.360]  launched by the Nazis the French military stood down under orders by their
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:11.800]  generals who then moved down to vc France and ran things they marshal Tito or
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:16.760]  whatever his name was and now they're repeating it macron is saying you know
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:20.120]  you need to be open you needed blah blah blah to be looted by the globalist who
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:24.560]  people like bono pays less than 1% of the money he raises for Africa to it
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:29.120]  these are all monsters the EU bureaucrats don't pay taxes and now
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:33.520]  they're telling the UK that never voted to be in the EU that they have to stay
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:39.160]  and what about this EU army and and just the arrogance and macron saying
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:42.880]  nationalism is the opposite of patriotism that's saying white is the
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:47.880]  opposite of white red is the opposite of red you know Hillary Clinton's in great
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:51.920]  shape it's crazy yeah and some background on Macron I think is helpful
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:55.600]  because he sort of just appeared from nowhere and people just went okay he's
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:58.960]  the leader of France I'll accept that but actually people need to really
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:04.280]  question Macron and his background he's actually part of the intellectual elite
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:08.440]  to the establishment he wormed his way to the position he's in well let's say
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:13.120]  it he was a pedophilic sex toy well of the establishment that's on record and
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:17.520]  oh look a manual Macron's Rothschild years make him an easy election target
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:22.880]  financial times yes so they know Macron he's a special puppet to the point of
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:28.440]  literally shoving their arm in him and puppeting him that's a strong way to put
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:34.280]  it mr. Jones but I do think that Macron is a slime you know he has come from
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:39.720]  inside the very system that he pretends that he's against secondly yes he did
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:43.640]  marry his drama teacher who's like 50 years older than him and they were
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:47.800]  together at school when he was just a boy and there is this really when you see
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:51.920]  them together away from the cameras she is a very old I mean I'm quite an old
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:55.640]  lady but she's a properly old lady and it's a very very weird relationship and
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:59.440]  that tells you something about him also he was sparkly nail polish not saying
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:04.800]  anything about that but well the issue is is that he is a I mean it's come out
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:09.880]  in the news he is a he's been a sex toy since he was 13 or 14 of these elite
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:13.200]  parties she would take him to and that's how he went right to the top all the way
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:18.520]  up as it were and the other thing is I was there when he was elected because
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:23.920]  obviously I was in front to champion Marine Le Pen and champion the patriotic
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:27.880]  movement that was behind Marine Le Pen and actually there was a slim chance at
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:30.760]  one point that she might actually pull it off and she's in the lead again I
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:35.520]  know it's just that's so exciting and very excited but when he walked up to
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:39.560]  the stage which was all set out for him to celebrate as well as people like
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:44.680]  myself walked in we were given t-shirts to wear with him on them we were given
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:48.280]  t-shirts to wear this is him with a big black pyramid behind yo yeah it was all
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:52.160]  the staging was huge show microns inauguration a big black pyramid yeah
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:56.400]  the flashing red light behind him as he walked up to the stage he walked up to
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:01.800]  the EU anthem he did not there you up to the French national anthem and all of
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:06.200]  Marine Le Pen stuff was the flying of the flag he walked up to the EU national
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:09.160]  anthem and why did why are the French buying into literally having their
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:13.280]  noses rubbed in is it a form of cuckolding I so weird you know so many
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:18.200]  voters are so it drives me crazy they're so lazy they look at a picture and they
[01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:21.680]  go oh does he look nice oh yeah he looks quite nice would I have a drink with
[01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:24.640]  him oh yeah I'd have a drink with him and then they think I wouldn't have a
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:29.160]  drink with Marine Le Pen and so they vote for him he is such a slime and such
[01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:33.040]  a cheese ball and yet he has no authenticity and you can see it you
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:37.480]  can see how shallow he is you can see it when you look at him I think but when
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:42.680]  I saw him he's so unimpressive whereas Marine Le Pen support is so deep is so
[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:47.520]  authentic is so grounded and she's been in this for such a long time and her
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:51.840]  partnered with Salvini from Italy is just a glory what does that do to the
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:56.000]  globalist that from Brazil to Italy everywhere you where you get a vote
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.280]  people say yeah we don't want to be run by some you know shadowy group who we
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:03.600]  don't even know who they are it's so exciting so that there's a part of me
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:07.200]  coming from Western Europe coming from the UK that is so it's like standing in
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:11.280]  a cold shower like I just have to endure it a bit like you have to endure the
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:15.200]  treatment you receive for info wars you know it's an endurance struggle that
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:19.760]  we're part of here we're all in for the fight but when you see these movements I
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:23.320]  was in Germany for the most recent elections where Merkel ended up having
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:27.040]  to stand down where the AFD were triumphant where the leader of the
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:30.800]  Greens has just said that the horde of invading migrants was one of the worst
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:34.880]  mistakes we've made in history and that's from the Green Party leader and when
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:40.120]  you see Salvini so resurgent and you see Marine Le Pen coming back on form
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:45.640]  there is something so exciting going on in Poland Poland if you saw the parade
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:50.520]  in Poland for Independence Day 250,000 people and people like me they get it
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:53.520]  because they've been overrun by Hitler they've been overrun by the Russians
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:57.200]  they've been overrun by the Islamists they have it in their DNA that they've
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:01.040]  been overrun a bunch so brilliant and so there's so I interviewed the leader of
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:05.040]  the law and order party you know it's the safest place in Europe to be a woman
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:09.800]  it's the place in Europe where they've never had a terrorist attack in Poland
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:14.560]  and that day after 250,000 people marched in the street people took pictures of
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:20.080]  the street they were immaculate nothing damaged nothing burnt nothing spoiled
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:26.680]  no vehicles damaged respectful Christian culture they will be the Israel for the
[01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:30.400]  Christian culture they will be well you've got you've got Germans and others
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:36.480]  fleeing to Eastern Europe now because the West is so dead in the West that
[01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:40.200]  we're now refinding what's left of the West in the East of course Israel will
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:44.160]  be the home for the Jewish people who are persecuted being persecuted right now
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:48.120]  as we speak by rockets from half oh if the globalists win I mean America's
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:51.600]  overtaken I will have to go with my family 10 15 20 years from now to
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:55.040]  whatever redoubt or refuge there is for Christians yeah and there will be this
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:59.920]  sense we see it in South Africa the South African whites there's only you
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:02.640]  know they say there's only two more years that we will have whites in South
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:07.280]  Africa they are pulling back to a defendable territory they are prepared
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:10.920]  to make a last stand they talk of dying in their boots and we will do the same
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:15.120]  we will pull back to a last stand a defendable territory and I think that
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:18.800]  would be Poland Hungary Eastern Europe and let's be clear then all the
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:22.360]  civilization will collapse it's not even the minorities that want this in the
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:26.800]  West Islam doesn't take over it's our own globalist elites that come out of
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:32.600]  the West that want to sacrifice the West because the idea of freedom threatens
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:36.840]  them they're literally betting that they can defeat freedom this is World War
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:42.160]  four it is and it is it is I think not widely acknowledged or not acknowledged
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:47.400]  enough that it's equally profitable to manage the decline of a country people
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:50.840]  always say why why does Britain let him solid it it's easier and more
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:53.920]  profitable to manage the decline of the country and take the money from the
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:58.240]  Saudis for another mosque than it is to try and defend or robustly there's a
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:02.480]  bunch of weaklings and sellouts that only care about now but above that there's
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:07.640]  the really evil globalist and and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and the
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:10.960]  Soros is the world who said he wants to overthrow Israel but there are these
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:16.160]  people that really want to destroy anything that's you know ancient Judaic
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:20.560]  or ancient Christian they're threatened by it absolutely and that's why we've
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:25.160]  seen in the Outer Hebrides which I was just looking for a map but off the
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:29.680]  coast of Scotland so the furthest northerly point of Scotland the the most
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:33.600]  far north that you can go the islands off the coast of Scotland so literally
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:38.080]  the middle of nowhere a new mega mosque has just been planned for one of those
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:41.920]  islands these are these are planted flags these are like alien motherships
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:45.360]  landing and disgorging their troops and that was known as the sort of Catholic
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:49.000]  heartland that was known as the place where Christianity was sort of and this
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.040]  current hope says don't investigate pedophilia in the US shut down
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:55.920]  investigations he ordered him today or last night to do that and he's the one
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:00.120]  saying open Europe up he gets nauseated close quote when he hears about our
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:04.360]  Christian roots in Europe what's going on with this guy yeah the Pope's a crazy
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:08.040]  individual and it really concerns me I see it with the Pope I see it with a
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:13.560]  number of rabbis that come from the left side of the equation rabbis who will who
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:16.840]  know that actually and I'm such a supporter of Israel and the rights of
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:20.520]  Jews to have a homeland and yet there are these rabbis in Western Europe that
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:24.640]  encourage the Muslims to come because they believe they clear how many times
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:28.600]  did the Muslims get to the gates of the Vatican in sac Rome but the Vatican's
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:33.840]  hundred foot walls stopped them and she's literally he's literally trying to
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:36.800]  kill what's left of Christendom I think so and I think one of the interesting
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:40.360]  things about being minorities is that in South Africa if I think of the white
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:44.280]  farmers even when they're a minority they're only a tiny percentage of the
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:48.280]  population they still don't gain any rights you know the Vatican will end up
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:51.360]  being a mosque just like the blue mosque was formerly the big church in
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:54.680]  in Istanbul a formerly conscious double start interrupt no you're good
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:58.560]  interrupt is what you do I'm famous for it yeah exactly that's what you take when
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:01.080]  you come I do a little too much but no when I was seeing that that will be a
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:05.480]  mosque the Vatican will be a big giant mosque what will they call it they'll
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:10.000]  call it the great the Grand Mosque of Rome that's it because in Belgium we
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.440]  have the the Grand Mosque of Brussels there's always a title that kind of
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:19.040]  links it implicitly to the area it's located in and the Grand Mosque of
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:23.720]  Brussels I was given rent-free for a hundred years to the Saudis rent-free
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:26.920]  and they're and they're taking take the crosses down they're ordering them to

[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:05.360]  war room I could have you on so much and hopefully we'll be working more
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:09.000]  together you're doing great work out on the road in the last four minutes we
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:13.320]  have what other big nuggets I mean really you're here raising the alarm from
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:17.920]  from the UK that may actually be lost I'm here to raise the lamp particularly
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:21.040]  Minnesota and Michigan they know they're screwed but I'm here to tell you you
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:25.080]  really are screwed and the last thing I'd like to talk about please is Asia
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:30.400]  BB a lady a persecuted Christian in Pakistan she was alleged to have
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:35.360]  committed blasphemy she was kept on death row for nine years she was released
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:39.240]  recently by the Supreme Court very brave decision because now everybody wants to
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:43.120]  kill the judges that says no she didn't commit blasphemy she asked the
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:49.080]  UK she's a mother of five she asked the UK if her family could begin a new life
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:54.080]  in the UK and what do you think we told her Alex as a Christian country what do
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:59.360]  you think we told a persecuted Christian we told her no you cannot have
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:05.320]  asylum in the UK because we do not want to upset local communities we don't want
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:10.640]  to upset local communities can you imagine a situation where a persecuted
[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:17.120]  woman a Christian can't we accept jihadis we accept half of Africa we accept
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:20.800]  anybody you accept ISIS and al-Qaeda if they said they want to come back and be
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:24.360]  reformed and they're given better housing than than war vets I mean that's in
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:27.920]  the news so this woman they're trying to kill her there's a thought to out she's
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:31.840]  a Christian she has incredible courage she's a political prisoner a political
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:35.880]  dissonant and she says please help me Christendom and the left says not just
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:40.880]  no hell no lady and the right and the prime minister and everybody in my country
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:45.480]  says no because we don't want to upset the Muslim communities and so I say the
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:50.640]  next time we have an Islamic terrorist attack in the UK and the next time our
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:56.040]  political leadership stands up and says we carry on as normal we are not going
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:03:01.920]  to be beaten by terrorists we are not cowed remember Asia BB we are cowed
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:07.200]  this is the symbol of how my country is cowed because we will not give refuge
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:10.440]  to a Christian woman because we don't want to upset the muslims they're
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:15.680]  trying to kill yeah they will kill her they will kill and the left why does the
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:19.560]  left it really is spiritual right as well Alex it's not just no no they all
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:24.080]  want a virtue signal to the precious Muslims and just run around behind them
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:28.120]  and like you know their droppings are like gold and it's just oh please let
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:30.960]  me give all my rights of you oh you're so wonderful most of you don't work you
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:35.600]  wear these big nightgown diapers out in public and I can kiss your ass and it's
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:39.960]  so true and you know this to me is the ultimate symbol we're cowed we just had
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:45.480]  a you European Court of Human Rights ruling that says the right of Muslims
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:50.160]  not to be offended is greater than the freedom to speak or to speak freely and
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:54.360]  this is what we have now blasphemy laws in the UK and I want to be clear they're
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:57.840]  trying to conquer us I was against the wars in the Middle East and we took out
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:02.480]  moderate regimes and put the bad ones in as part of this plan it's insane it is
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:06.680]  properly insane and it is properly insane that's in the face of not giving a
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:10.760]  Christian woman you know any kind of refuge having welcomed well to the same
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:14.080]  realm that now they're saying within ten years all women's sports including
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:18.480]  basketball will be ruled by men who literally have not even had their
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:22.520]  testicles removed and are two feet three feet taller than women and and look
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:28.160]  like they could come in the barbarians ass we truly have reached a new stage of
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:33.400]  madness we really have and the UK is truly for fallen we are beyond sound well
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:36.040]  you know already in the Olympics like two or three of the top runners that went
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:39.600]  all the championships are actually him afro Dutch of course nothing against
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:43.360]  their him afro Dutch but you know these guys can have babies I mean they can get
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:48.880]  women pregnant oh my gosh Katie Hopkins amazing Hopkins world ladies and gentlemen
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:56.320]  check it out today Hopkins world dot com mark dice coming up stay with us the
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:59.880]  globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:03.440]  environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:09.320]  that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to
[02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:13.640]  bring our listeners and viewers the best idea in the world we've gone through two
[02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:18.520]  permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:22.120]  and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:26.480]  deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been
[02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:30.920]  incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research
[02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:36.040]  and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists
[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:39.560]  scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three
[02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:45.400]  other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it super charges it and makes
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:50.560]  it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you
[02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:55.080]  want to see it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at m4's
[02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:57.560]  live dot com
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:13.120]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:20.720]  listening to Alex Jones you know people like Katie Hopkins people like Ron Paul
[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:25.480]  people like Paul Joseph Watson people like Mark Dice people like Matt Drudge
[02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:29.440]  people like Tucker Carlson who I've talked to quite a bit believe it at that
[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:35.200]  it's just so good to be a patriot to be a nationalist be a Christian and to be
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:38.320]  for freedom and I get to know all the coolest people in the world like
[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:43.400]  President Trump you look at our people whether they're black white old young
[02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:47.400]  they have light in their eyes of liberty you look at the left they are
[02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:50.960]  crazy people Mark Dice with us for the rest of the hour he's got his new book
[02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:55.000]  that starts ordering today we've got a big shipment of them coming in so we'll
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:00.360]  have those links up on m4store.com we'll tell you about his new book here in
[02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:03.880]  just a moment but first let's play one of his best little pieces here that went
[02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:08.640]  viral tens of millions of years cable news crazies completely unchanged Mark
[02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:15.560]  Dice here it is we're gonna see if this rain lasts for 30 days or two years or
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:20.200]  a thousand year right because that is how that is what these people have set
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:24.120]  themselves up for and I believe that they need to move from saying well I
[02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:29.320]  don't like his tweets but you know the economy's doing okay I mean they need to
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:33.440]  move from there to reality which is that we have a white nationalist president
[02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:37.400]  who's a threat to American democracy not only is Donald Trump a white
[02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:41.000]  supremacist sympathizer I think he identifies with this notion of white
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:46.880]  supremacy this notion of preservation of white culture this is about black
[02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:51.560]  versus white this is about Donald Trump's appeal to racism and it just
[02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:56.160]  happens all the time and we never say it we don't say it enough for what it is
[02:07:56.160 --> 02:08:00.360]  but that's what's going on he went full Hitler and admitted he's a nationalist
[02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:04.960]  we can stop calling it a dog whistle look at what his slogan make America great
[02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:09.800]  again means we know what it means we know what it meant make America white
[02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:14.840]  again you have a Republican party who was giving aid and comfort to the
[02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:18.280]  proud boys and to white nationalists and they become the party of white
[02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:22.840]  nationalists and all of their hatred a guy who was sending a message by time
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:27.080]  and time again tweeting about baseball or talking about his bad hair day there
[02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:36.360]  that was done intentionally to send a message to white nationalists I didn't
[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:40.520]  think white people would put him in office so here he is running around the
[02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:45.480]  country appealing to our darker angels appealing to our hatreds and fears do
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:51.440]  they agree with him or is he using some sort of like cult-like force to to try
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:55.940]  to make them see that we're gonna write this ship we are gonna write the ship
[02:08:55.940 --> 02:09:00.200]  there's no way that he's gonna prevail because he's evil he's dark it's the
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:04.760]  opposite of what America stands for the president of the United States is
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:11.480]  racist all of us already knew that Kanye West is engaging in one of the most
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:18.040]  nefarious practices yet a black body and brain are the warehouse for the
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:22.640]  articulation and expression of anti-black sentiments that have been
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:27.280]  chin-checked by people with far more rigorous credentials this is white
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:32.040]  supremacy by ventriloquism a black mouth is moving but white racist ideals are
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:36.280]  flowing from Kanye West's mouth Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:40.880]  read and and we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it and
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:45.440]  perverted the thing about Trump though is that he's the recruiter in chief he
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:50.760]  is for ice he is basically working with ISIS yes to kill us this president has
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:55.640]  radicalized so many more people than ISIS ever did I mean the way he talks the
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:10:02.040]  way he the way he that is that just it's the way he talks the way the way that
[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:06.520]  he allows these people the way he winks and nods to these groups the way he
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:10.320]  says I know I'm not supposed to say it but I'm a nationalist he wants to send
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:13.280]  the military to the border so I would have sent the military to the White
[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:20.720]  House to get him I don't even know if we're gonna get to 2020 as it's about
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:26.480]  democracy so we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:32.560]  threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized right up to the
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:37.080]  right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:41.800]  ban on them there is no ban on you know the hit the Muslim ban there is no white
[02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:45.920]  guy ban so what do we do about that I don't want to have that fight with you
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:51.920]  hey it's okay the meantime I'm president and you're not waging war on
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:58.200]  corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info
[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:05.840]  war well mark dice has been a busy media commentator for the decade plus I've
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:11.440]  known him a while how time flies mark dice calm and for now he's been shadow
[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:15.840]  banned and demonetized but he still reaches tens of millions of people a week
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:20.560]  on YouTube and at Twitter at mark dice and I see him stick up for me all the
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:25.440]  time I don't have a voice on those platforms and you know the bad part
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:31.720]  about the censorship is this they can then say whatever they want about you
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:35.120]  whatever lies they want about you and you can't respond they could say that we
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:39.000]  put up fake video when we don't they can say that I'm a Nazi or not it's good
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.080]  to have people sticking up for us like mark dice you know mark sort of making
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:45.880]  videos every day about info wars when we got banned and like every week since
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:50.840]  then when almost everybody else putting old so-called friends won't even talk to
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:56.040]  me now because they're so afraid it's gonna happen to them that's a spirit
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:00.840]  that'll allow the takeover to happen and so we hang together we hang separate
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:05.760]  mark you've got a new book out that just came out today I got a big shipment of
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:12.040]  them coming in here info or stored calm liberalism find a cure great name I
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:16.840]  always great information we really do need a cure so mark what do you want to
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:21.320]  dive into first well first of all it's an honor to be on the most banned
[02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:26.440]  broadcast probably in world history and that's not an exaggeration and modern
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:30.640]  liberalism has ballooned into a mental health crisis and that clip that you just
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:34.560]  played that compilation is just a small sample of what the general public are
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:40.800]  inundated with every day on MSNBC and CNN and I joke that I watch CNN's that you
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:44.840]  don't have to because that's what people are subjected to every day and if we
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:49.280]  win this which hopefully we will it's clips like that which will literally be
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:53.560]  in the history books analyzing the level of propaganda that was being pushed
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:57.800]  because it's even more vile and more sophisticated than the propaganda that
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:04.680]  helped foment communist revolutions in China and in Russia and we're seeing the
[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:12.440]  Democrat Party has morphed into this strange Maoist communist little little
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:19.400]  red shirt Stalinist type of a group because for for generations the
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:23.200]  differences between liberals and conservatives were pretty well established
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:28.480]  you you knew generally where each party stood on certain issues each party had
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:33.600]  reasonable arguments about the issues that they were putting forth but in the
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:38.560]  last few years the Democrat Party Democrats liberals the left have morphed
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:45.040]  into this social justice warrior psychosis and it is a mental health
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:49.080]  crisis and most of your audience has probably been monitoring this for some
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:53.040]  time but even if you've been watching this unfold for the last few years if
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:56.440]  it's just the tip of the insanity iceberg that's getting ready to burst
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:14:01.200]  through and if we don't stop this cultural revolution this marks the
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:05.600]  cultural Marxist revolution that they're trying to push forward the human race
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:10.480]  is going to be fragmented into so many different pieces we'll we're gonna have
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:14.080]  a nuclear war we're gonna kill each other the fact that the psych warfare
[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:19.560]  experts are undermining civilization to try to maintain control which is in the
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:22.200]  WikiLeaks they admit they're doing and the fact that they're going to pure
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:26.400]  Hitler level race-baiting but just for the minority perspective trying to
[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:30.920]  invoke total division it's criminal it's a wonder we're not in total civil war
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:35.280]  it's horrible in Wisconsin all these young kids hiling Hitler with a black
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:39.600]  kid with them but they're doing it as a response to the total Hitlerian garbage
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:42.720]  from the left and I decry both sides but that's what you're gonna do you're
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:46.040]  gonna make people into extreme groups just like they do in prisons on purpose
[02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:48.840]  where they put everybody in their own racial group and you got to get a Nazi
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:52.960]  tattoo or the whites kill you if you're white you got to join the racist black
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:55.800]  group and get the tattoo or they're gonna kill you in this you got to join
[02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:00.000]  the Mexican mafia or ms-13 and or they're gonna kill you they are they are
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:04.960]  making people get into these racial groups yeah you agreed a lot of you know
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:08.520]  that photo that you're talking about the students making the the hand sign is
[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:13.920]  really just them trolling and reacting to this you know to this oppression of
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:18.040]  free speech trying to get a reaction trying to push the envelope as far as
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:22.480]  they can and these these leftists are pushing our culture so far over the
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:26.840]  cliff the victorious secrets fashion show was just last week and now there's a
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:33.000]  campaign in order to include transgender women in the victorious secrets
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:38.080]  catalog and in the fashion show obese women or fat women I'm sorry that you're
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:41.720]  not even allowed to say fat anymore that's so that's every culture every
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:45.800]  society every system that has its own culture is under attack this is the
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:50.000]  mega corporations taking over all culture to then dictate that only they

[02:19:56.680 --> 02:20:17.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:27.200 --> 02:20:34.840]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones. Well back
[02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:38.520]  on August 6th when I got banned on 30-something big platforms now it's
[02:20:38.520 --> 02:20:44.880]  hundreds Mark Dyson others pointed out that everybody else is next and now
[02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:48.040]  they're going after leftist groups as well establishment left goes after
[02:20:48.040 --> 02:20:50.600]  rival left once the damn breaks everybody gets censored
[02:20:50.600 --> 02:20:53.480]  Congress needs to act the president needs to act we need to get all the
[02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:57.520]  influential people like Mark Dyson others just to push the president to act
[02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:00.680]  and the president's getting ready to act and I know Tucker Carlson's pushing him
[02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:05.800]  as well but you talked Mark Mark Dyson media commentator mark dice.com you know
[02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:09.560]  beloved out there for years the right work you do pointing out the irony the
[02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:14.600]  corruption the the just the craziness of the out of control left and their race
[02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:22.280]  based politics and system where are they going to go next because you sort of
[02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:27.160]  bringing this up that this weaponization is so dangerous that it's not like it's
[02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:32.360]  just some ideology this is an ideology that wants to take over every facet of
[02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:38.000]  society it wants total domination. Well as they're developing more sophisticated
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:42.520]  AI systems every day so if you just use the wrong words or post a wrong photo or
[02:21:42.520 --> 02:21:46.640]  post a link to certain websites then that'll just be disappeared down the
[02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:51.800]  memory hole CEO the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is talking about removing the
[02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:57.480]  public follower count and the like count because if somebody like me can have
[02:21:57.480 --> 02:22:02.600]  350,000 Twitter followers and over a million YouTube subscribers that shows
[02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:06.080]  that my message is resonating with a lot of people and so they don't want to
[02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:10.120]  they don't want people to see that and I just checked before even before coming
[02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:15.840]  on this broadcast Alex my book liberals and find a cure number 18 on Amazon's
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:19.800]  bestseller list that's before doing any any interviews that's literally just
[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:24.000]  announcing it on my YouTube channel which gets about a third of the audience
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:28.200]  as Anderson Cooper or Don Lemon which is why they're scared to death because if
[02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:33.640]  just one guy on a laptop in his kitchen can get a third of the viewers a CNN a
[02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:39.360]  billion dollar network and rise break through the top 20 on Amazon's bestseller
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:43.280]  list who knows how high we can get it so hope everyone will pick up a copy well
[02:22:43.280 --> 02:22:48.440]  that is super exciting and it's like when our apps went to number one Apple
[02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:52.520]  just took the app down five stars thirty something thousand reviews three
[02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:56.280]  million downloads and their answer was we're just taking it down part of the
[02:22:56.280 --> 02:23:01.000]  curation and Tim Cook oh if something has five stars and people love it and
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:05.000]  it's backfired on us we'll just remove it but what you said is huge that's not
[02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:09.440]  just in political then that's that's number 18 total that shows how hungry
[02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:13.400]  and I got a correction you get put on all these other platforms you get aired
[02:23:13.400 --> 02:23:16.640]  everywhere they manipulate your view counts you have well over a million
[02:23:16.640 --> 02:23:20.080]  views and all your videos you have some videos of 10 15 20 million views when
[02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:22.840]  and when you hear that Anderson Cooper has a million two million viewers
[02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:26.760]  Nielsen's been caught faking those they had to pay to be on an airport fit to
[02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:30.800]  pay to be on all these places and they add that into it when when when Cooper
[02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:35.120]  got paid what was tens of millions of dollars by Facebook to do these these
[02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:41.400]  videos literally my junior reporters would have five times the viewers of
[02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:44.320]  Anderson Cooper that's what they had to take us off Twitter and take us off
[02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:48.200]  Facebook for our live feeds so I could go out my backyard and shoot a video and
[02:23:48.200 --> 02:23:51.440]  they would have it you know 300,000 even after they put the shadow ban on us and
[02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:55.280]  then Cooper is being paid millions and the things got 50,000 views after he's
[02:23:55.280 --> 02:23:59.000]  on there for an hour with total promotion so you're bigger than Anderson
[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:04.280]  Cooper let's be clear Mark does and I think so and thanks for pointing that
[02:24:04.280 --> 02:24:08.800]  out because we do have to really look at the solid numbers Anderson Cooper's
[02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:12.160]  live streams on Facebook like you were talking about he was getting barely
[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:17.400]  2000 viewers okay a total joke that's why earlier this year as you know Facebook
[02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:21.080]  YouTube manipulated the algorithm so that whenever you search for almost any
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:26.880]  topic the top search results are all authoritative sources from mainstream
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:30.040]  media and before that it used to be the most popular videos the most well
[02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:34.840]  engaged videos with the most watch time and so that was a way so they broke in
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:40.120]  their algorithm they they've favored all of the mainstream media news outlets and
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:45.120]  I did a test on some of my most popular videos one of which was buried under 50
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:51.080]  other results results that had a few thousand views in all from mainstream
[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:55.200]  media channels they're terrified of our message which is why they banned you from
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:25:00.320]  almost everything it's quite stunning and it's they memory hold Alex Jones which
[02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:05.280]  is despicable and it was it was it was good to see some people come out in
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:10.320]  support but there was also disappointing that there wasn't more support for Alex
[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:14.000]  because I think a lot of people were a little bit scared or perhaps they want
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:17.040]  to distance themselves from some of things that Alex has said in the past
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:21.760]  but what they did to Alex was a test and now that they were able to do it they
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:25.400]  just keep on going keep on going and you notice the group that went and harassed
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:30.760]  Anderson or Tucker Carlson's wife and kids outside of his own house they were
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:34.000]  still allowed last I checked they were still on Facebook they were allowed on
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.800]  Twitter for 12 to 16 hours after they posted that video and they were posting
[02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:43.240]  other videos harassing other politicians Ted Cruz posting their children's
[02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:47.080]  schools posting their phone numbers doxing people and he said something
[02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:53.480]  killer they years ago began to take comment sections out of the big papers
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:56.800]  because they learn people respected that more than the article and most of it
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:02.480]  was awake just like they can't have you with with five stars so Netflix and
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:06.400]  others start taking away the star process because they're going to steal
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:11.240]  elections now out in the open and they can't have us be super popular and get
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:15.880]  all the popular votes online with any form of voting system and then the
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:19.680]  Liberty Movement loses at the polls so they can't let anybody know that you're
[02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:23.480]  not alone it's in fact they talk about it in white papers don't let us have any
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:26.920]  community don't let us have any aid or comfort don't let us have any culture
[02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:31.200]  make us be totally alone in our Facebook prison Facebook executives have gone
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:35.640]  public saying it's we were there to make you depressed under our control and then
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:38.800]  we have fake political bots that become your friends that aren't even real
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:43.240]  people 10 to 1 and then you're literally in a in a mental institution under
[02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:48.480]  radicalization under their mind control and they're setting this up so that you
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:53.200]  can't get ordinary Americans can't disagree with this insane agenda part of
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:56.680]  the reason that you were banned is because you criticized a drag queen
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:00.360]  festival that involves children and the things that I don't even want to
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:04.360]  discuss but I do cover in the book by the way and I quoted exactly what you said
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:09.240]  about it it seems reasonable criticism to me a reasonable reaction but that's
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:15.240]  not allowed because 2 plus 2 equals 5 under the current establishment and so
[02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:21.480]  people are getting scared to even speak out against this insane agenda and so
[02:27:21.480 --> 02:27:25.320]  they keep pushing it further and further and people at the big companies as well
[02:27:25.320 --> 02:27:31.400]  are afraid to not cave into this we talk I saw that you cover my tweet to
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:34.760]  target about the Black Panther I should have opened it up about that that was
[02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:37.560]  just a few weeks ago during Halloween tell people about that who might have
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:41.160]  missed it it was brought to my attention that a Black Panther Halloween
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:46.200]  costume model on target calm was being modeled by a white boy and so I
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:49.880]  sarcastically tweeted to them that it's terrible and that this is a black only
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:52.800]  costume and they took it down they took down the photo of the white boy
[02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:56.520]  modeling the costume and then later I started researching I saw an article from
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:00.040]  People magazine saying you know what white parents you really want to think
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:05.480]  twice before allowing your children to dress up as the Black Panther Marvel
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:10.040]  superhero and it's so insane there's a little chapter in my book on imaginary
[02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:14.200]  racism because with many mental illnesses people hallucinate and see and hear
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:19.000]  things that aren't there and so we've been seeing this rash of imaginary
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:24.360]  racism in companies and communities caving into it there was a park I think
[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:28.960]  it was in Texas where somebody complained that there was a gorilla in the
[02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:33.520]  park as it was an animal themed a circus themed playground for the children and
[02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:37.360]  of course there was a gorilla there and a camel and a lion and all sorts of other
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:42.880]  animals and somebody complained that all this this this ape is racist or this
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:49.120]  monkey is racist and so the city took it down they removed the statue hey all over
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:52.800]  the country people are who have the last Irish name Lynch are changing their name
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:57.280]  and they're taking it off buildings in these uncertain times it makes sense to
[02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:00.720]  have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water if your current
[02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:04.600]  plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire and
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:08.360]  there's a much better way the Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass burning
[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:12.280]  cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel
[02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:15.840]  the Minuteman stove is easy to use smokeless portable powerful and
[02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:19.720]  sustainable for the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:24.200]  right here in the USA go to Minuteman stove dot com that's Minuteman stove dot
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:29.000]  com what if there was a social media network only for the conservative what

[02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:36.080]  public but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:40.280]  and what if the social media network was the only free speech network in

[02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:30.680]  so how do you assault Western culture and the Renaissance that's truly liberal
[02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:34.880]  in the classical sense and egalitarian trying to build people up believing
[02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:39.920]  in humanity you make ugly architecture you attack the family salty classified
[02:33:39.920 --> 02:33:46.600]  and you start with political correctness things like Nazis and then once you ban
[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:51.520]  that you move on to the family you move on to people that say a man competing
[02:33:51.520 --> 02:33:56.160]  in women's sports is not a woman you arrest them here it is gorilla statue
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:01.240]  finally removed from Texas Park over two decades following complaints of racism
[02:34:01.240 --> 02:34:06.800]  and it's a themed park that has giraffes and other things they were folks were
[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:12.680]  nice enough to build for kids like it's a zoo but not living animals it's a
[02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:21.280]  really classy nice part well a gorilla is racist because first first if you you
[02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:26.560]  know have monkey attire and my kids love monkeys and saying little monkey you
[02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:30.920]  know my daughter has a shirt my youngest daughter says you little monkey well if
[02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:36.920]  you have a store in South Africa shows a little black kid in a shirt saying I'm
[02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:40.080]  the number one monkey well that's suddenly racist because you're
[02:34:40.080 --> 02:34:45.280]  projecting that people are saying black people look like monkeys when we humans
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:49.040]  are I mean we're made by God I'm not saying we are an ape but our DNA is you

[02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:59.400]  reality ladies and gentlemen it's a war on words it's a war on communication
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:04.040]  where all these ignorant people don't know anything but interpreting they took
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:07.800]  them Martin Luther King statues and murals all over universities because

[02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:59.880]  stealing the election now in front of us the left's answer to populism fighting
[02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:04.480]  globalism and winning every election across the world is as I predicted total
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:08.440]  fraud they're doing it in front of God and country they are I mean it is just
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:12.240]  wild what what's coming next mark dice and then tell us about liberalism find
[02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:15.880]  a cure what an amazing title all your books are great I'm so proud of you that

[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:23.240]  right now so everyone is a political act even though I hate Amazon because they
[02:37:23.240 --> 02:37:26.320]  rip off the authors and markets almost nothing should go there and buy
[02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:30.160]  liberalism find a cure read it and then donate it to the library a political
[02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:37.480]  act of resistance mark dice people have to stop apologizing to lunatics we saw
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:41.840]  the mean the head director of marketing for Victoria's Secret apologized for
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:46.320]  saying that he didn't want to have transgenders or that it it wasn't a
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:50.960]  problem that there were no transgender women in the Victoria's Secret show and
[02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:54.760]  a day or two later they apologize on their official accounts and oh it's so
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:59.640]  sorry and we'd love to have them in there because as Andrew Breitbart said
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:04.160]  politics is downstream from culture so if the culture keeps getting polluted
[02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:08.800]  we're gonna see more and more laws that then prevent us from speaking out in
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:14.120]  multiple states now California included on your driver's license you can check
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:19.880]  that you're neither a man or a woman just an X or an NA for not available and
[02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:24.960]  we don't have any sort of standards for you know what what is a transgender man
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:28.800]  or a woman and if somebody could just self identify what's gonna what they're
[02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:33.360]  saying is we control reality men go in on purpose spread their legs and say
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:36.520]  check my cervix check my uterus and it's like you don't have one and then
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:41.120]  those people are fired this is a cult of the left saying we can remember when
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:44.720]  Winston's being tortured by O'Brien and he says listen we can suspend the laws of
[02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:48.840]  gravity we want and two plus two will be whatever I want it to be at when I'm
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:53.960]  done wrecking your mind yes and then by the end he thinks there's no gravity he
[02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:58.120]  thinks two plus two equals whatever O'Brien says this is brainwashing when
[02:38:58.120 --> 02:39:01.640]  a cult says there is no mother and father there are no genders there are no
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:06.720]  mother and father there are no genders you're in a brainwashing cult they want
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:10.080]  you to believe that two plus two equals five and there's an organization that's
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:15.360]  lobbying Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers to stop referring to
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:21.080]  the women the pregnant women as women and as you know she and her because a
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:26.480]  gender non-conforming woman went in to get an abortion and she was offended
[02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:31.680]  that they were calling her a she and they're even saying that it's wrong to
[02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:37.760]  say that women have periods and men can get pregnant now and if you even just
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:42.720]  use the caveat you know a transgender woman or a trans to make the distinction
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:48.520]  between an actual biological chromosomal individual they're saying that
[02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:52.240]  that's discrimination and that's and again it's always more more more more
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:56.560]  and Kenny Hoppers was talking about at what point is there a limit and I don't
[02:39:56.560 --> 02:39:59.320]  think there is a limit I think they're gonna start saying we choose to come
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:03.120]  kill you at your house we call this giving you life and then you'll be
[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:06.280]  arrested if you don't want to let this come kill you yeah if we don't win this
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:09.840]  the Christians are gonna literally have to live like the Amish in our own little
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:14.480]  villages where we completely disconnect and are self-sufficient because we can't
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:18.320]  interact with these people you can't send your kids to a public school are you
[02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:21.840]  kidding me that all the money I've already come to that realization that I
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:25.560]  really love my children I have to move to the country and I have to literally
[02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:29.080]  disconnect from everything it's true I mean we are literally going to what the
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:34.320]  Amish went through in Germany and Switzerland 500 years ago every day on
[02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:38.720]  social media or every week there's these far leftist trending topics that are
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:44.520]  artificially inflated or astroturfed or paid to present every time there's a new
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:48.360]  Disney movie or a superhero movie out the liberals are upset that the
[02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:52.760]  characters aren't gay or that they're not transgender they were upset when one
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:56.120]  of the new Captain America's came out because Captain America and his best
[02:40:56.120 --> 02:41:00.280]  friend Bucky they didn't have a relationship well in in the comics
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:03.880]  they're normal normal men and even saying that heterosexuality is normal is
[02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:07.200]  considered to be hateful as well because how dare you say that that's that
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:11.480]  that's normal and so they they want everything they are just pushing what
[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:15.600]  this is you just said it pushing it's the total saying you have no property
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:20.320]  even over your own mind they are absolutely not letting you have any of
[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:23.760]  your own territory or any of your own space just like quote sending in for
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:27.960]  career day in Colorado without telling the parents to teach kids to be a drag
[02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:32.400]  queen or or if you're a boy be a girl for your profession basically be a sex
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:36.680]  worker and and again it's the religion of getting into your territory not even
[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:40.880]  telling you when they do it it's all about disrespect and if there's just one
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:47.200]  complaint then corporations completely yield afraid to upset or to afraid to
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:52.200]  be labeled as you know non-inclusive there was a university recently to
[02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:57.200]  celebrate Black History Month some of the chefs in the in the cafeteria set
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:01.840]  up a special menu just to honor Black History Month with traditional black
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:07.280]  foods that included of course fried chicken and you know other other foods
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:10.440]  that are traditionally associated with black people that's the line I'm gonna
[02:42:10.440 --> 02:42:14.080]  be in and it's delicious who doesn't like fried chicken I love it
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:18.280]  watermelon don't totally delicious but that was considered to be offensive
[02:42:18.280 --> 02:42:21.960]  even honoring which is just southern cooking I mean Mike give me collard
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:26.720]  greens give me mmm it was probably white social justice warriors
[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:31.920]  let me tell you so-called black cooking is what my grandma's both made in the
[02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:35.920]  southern cooking so I go that's part is the menu was set up by some black people
[02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:40.240]  in the cafeteria who did their best to honor their black heritage and the
[02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:43.440]  black foods that they like but they said oh that's offensive sorry can't do that
[02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:46.320]  gonna take it down because they're killing real black culture they're
[02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:51.160]  making it leftist poison racist culture no celebrate all culture particularly

[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:20.520]  jones your host coming up Paul Joseph Watson from the United Kingdom is ready
[02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:26.320]  to go mark dice is a busy guy he's hard to get on but he says now that the book
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:30.080]  is done he's gonna be on a lot more and we tell you I'm very excited he's had
[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:33.840]  some books that have done very very well but this new one liberalism find a
[02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:39.720]  cure just came out last few days and it's already hit number 18 total books on
[02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:44.680]  Amazon now I don't want to discourage things here but every time we've seen
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:48.120]  this for somebody else that's a patriot they then just cheat it and knock it
[02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:52.080]  up 2,000 or something but it doesn't matter people know the truth it's just
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:55.880]  the the rigging I mean we thought two and a half years ago during the election
[02:47:55.880 --> 02:48:00.000]  the rigging was bad taking out negative search terms about Hillary now it's like
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:04.000]  you said earlier it's just insane and like you said I said mark you did great
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:07.080]  man on the street to show how crazy leftist are but since you started doing
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:10.720]  political commentary all the time it's as good as it gets it's what the late
[02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:16.920]  night comics wish they were doing and so it's very very exciting and I just
[02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:21.080]  hear pop popularity just rising and rising that makes me feel good but then
[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:27.400]  I ask myself again how insane can this get what do you think about Trump you
[02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:30.400]  said during the break hey I've been more positive the last two years since
[02:48:30.400 --> 02:48:34.400]  Trump's in show have I think I've gotten behind him because he's for real but now
[02:48:34.400 --> 02:48:37.440]  we see them still in the election now we see them getting even worse than they
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:42.160]  were and at this point this is war I mean it's really flips and switches in my
[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:47.280]  brain well never before has your show's name info wars been more appropriate
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:50.360]  because it is an information war and you know we were talking during the break
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:53.040]  it's glad to be on your show I love talking with you in front of the
[02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:57.280]  audience may not know but I've been a guest in your show for 13 years back
[02:48:57.280 --> 02:49:02.080]  all the way to 2005 and you know it's great to be on the show great to be a
[02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:07.320]  part of the broadcast and since Trump won in 2016 you know my YouTube channel is
[02:49:07.320 --> 02:49:10.920]  sort of taking a slightly different direction so it's great to do interviews
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:14.000]  where people can see kind of the serious side to me because maybe a lot of people
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:17.360]  may think that I'm just like to joke around and be sarcastic but I am a
[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:21.600]  pretty serious guy I'm a big nerd I like writing books is my third 12th book
[02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:28.480]  13th book I lost track and you know you can't help but look at what the levels
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:32.520]  are doing and and you really just shake your head and laugh at it because it is
[02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:37.680]  in many cases impossible to distinguish what they're doing from sarcasm or from
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:43.240]  a parody and that's why we're seeing some trolls on 4chan just making up
[02:49:43.240 --> 02:49:47.960]  certain things and saying that symbols and milk is a symbol of their white
[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:53.680]  supremacy and then seeing that being taken as serious that's how crazy the
[02:49:53.680 --> 02:49:57.720]  culture has gotten so we are in a culture war we're in the information war
[02:49:57.720 --> 02:50:02.280]  and if we don't win this then we're going to sink down into a dystopian
[02:50:02.280 --> 02:50:08.200]  nightmare worse than 1984 because the technology wasn't there like we have now
[02:50:08.200 --> 02:50:12.560]  and we've been seeing it get worse every day every week and you can only
[02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:17.840]  imagine what it's going to be they may make it to a point where it looks like
[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:21.800]  your viewers are watching your content or liking it or responding to it but
[02:50:21.800 --> 02:50:26.880]  they're not even seeing it and they may get to a point where if you just say you
[02:50:26.880 --> 02:50:30.480]  know you don't you don't think that a transgender you know woman is is a you
[02:50:30.480 --> 02:50:33.840]  know a natural woman and they'll ban you just like last Christmas there was a
[02:50:33.840 --> 02:50:38.760]  race car driver who said told his nephew that boys don't wear princess dresses
[02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:43.720]  his boy his nephew was wearing a Disney dress I after Christmas morning and he
[02:50:43.720 --> 02:50:47.800]  said hey what are you doing you know like boys don't wear dresses and he was
[02:50:47.800 --> 02:50:53.360]  completely chastised headlines across the country how dare you tell his child
[02:50:53.360 --> 02:50:58.760]  it's a total attack on parenthood it's a total takeover I want to get your take
[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:03.600]  on this all Paul did as you know last week was zoom in on a costume people say
[02:51:03.600 --> 02:51:05.880]  oh it's a petty story why you keep covering it they made it the number
[02:51:05.880 --> 02:51:09.840]  one story in the country for two days not the election thieving any of it and
[02:51:09.840 --> 02:51:14.680]  and he didn't slow it up he didn't speed it he didn't do any of that all he did
[02:51:14.680 --> 02:51:18.200]  was blow it up as the president said but all the corporate media went with it
[02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:22.160]  called for Huckabee Sanders to be fired and even the Dallas morning news the
[02:51:22.160 --> 02:51:26.840]  local paper here in Austin said Jones is horrible next level lying fake video
[02:51:26.840 --> 02:51:30.440]  across it didn't even touch her but here's the key hundreds of papers I
[02:51:30.440 --> 02:51:34.880]  saw didn't even show the video or a link so now they don't even show you they
[02:51:34.880 --> 02:51:38.000]  go look at this doctored video but we're not gonna show it to you this is
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:44.480]  beyond 1984 now and Jim Acosta is a protester he's not a reporter he has no
[02:51:44.480 --> 02:51:48.520]  business being anywhere close to the president he's a heckler I put together
[02:51:48.520 --> 02:51:52.360]  a compilation on my YouTube channel last week showing just a small fraction of
[02:51:52.360 --> 02:51:57.200]  the instances of him just yelling out of turn being shushed by fellow
[02:51:57.200 --> 02:52:01.600]  reporters and there's CNN is now suing the White House in order to try to get
[02:52:01.600 --> 02:52:05.800]  the press pass back and I'm sorry mr. Acosta but the First Amendment doesn't
[02:52:05.800 --> 02:52:08.520]  mean that you'll be invited to the White House it means that the White House
[02:52:08.520 --> 02:52:13.000]  won't stop you from spewing your insanity on your own private property and
[02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:18.640]  if Jim Acosta is you know is allowed to be on the White House property after the
[02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:22.400]  White House says you know we don't want you here you're disruptive what's the
[02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:26.720]  stop anyone and everyone from going why don't I have a right to be into the in
[02:52:26.720 --> 02:52:29.480]  the White House press corps then they're discriminating against me I'm a
[02:52:29.480 --> 02:52:35.000]  media analyst why can't I be there it's insane he's a performance artist and a
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:39.640]  heckler and I don't know how anyone could watch CNN without getting a headache
[02:52:39.640 --> 02:52:45.400]  because it is absolutely nauseating and Anderson Cooper is making about 40
[02:52:45.400 --> 02:52:49.880]  thousand dollars per day per show people should know how much money these
[02:52:49.880 --> 02:52:55.840]  talking heads making same with Megan Kelly $40,000 a day to sit there and
[02:52:55.840 --> 02:53:00.200]  read a teleprompter and then comment about how bad Trump is and that's why
[02:53:00.200 --> 02:53:03.760]  they took you down because you were too large what really the largest
[02:53:03.760 --> 02:53:09.440]  independent media operation eclipsing them on all fronts and they couldn't have
[02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:13.480]  that and that's why they started demonizing me right after I saw a
[02:53:13.480 --> 02:53:19.600]  report from PBS said that well Alex's spawned countless imitators and they're
[02:53:19.600 --> 02:53:23.440]  they're selling merchandise and they showed me oh no let's stop them
[02:53:23.440 --> 02:53:26.360]  immediately let's not let them have any economy don't just take their speech
[02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:31.880]  take their bank accounts away and by the way he famously was the only heir to
[02:53:31.880 --> 02:53:36.000]  the Vanderbilt fortune it's so big and so secret it's rumored to be in the
[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:41.960]  trillions so yeah there's people worth trillions okay you know Cooper is at
[02:53:41.960 --> 02:53:46.040]  least worth 300 400 billion people go all the richest man in the world with 120
[02:53:46.040 --> 02:53:51.160]  billion no folks this is a trillionaire okay and so he's given a show with no
[02:53:51.160 --> 02:53:57.040]  ratings to set up there because just like I mean just like Tim Cook it's like
[02:53:57.040 --> 02:54:00.120]  it doesn't matter he's a trillionaire doesn't matter he's in the CIA doesn't
[02:54:00.120 --> 02:54:04.400]  matter he supports communist China killing people he's gay so it's cool part
[02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:08.920]  of left as plan undermining our culture is attacking all of our holidays and
[02:54:08.920 --> 02:54:13.240]  Thanksgiving is next week there isn't really a single holiday that they don't
[02:54:13.240 --> 02:54:18.160]  completely assault they're upset about Thanksgiving because of what the pilgrims
[02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:23.440]  supposedly did to the natives Christmas is as a white Christian holiday they
[02:54:23.440 --> 02:54:26.960]  want crit they want Santa Claus to be black and have a boyfriend there's
[02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:31.960]  really a children's book about that that came out last year Valentine's Day
[02:54:31.960 --> 02:54:36.200]  they're upset about because it celebrates heterosexual couples and
[02:54:36.200 --> 02:54:43.160]  traditional gender roles Mother's Day Father's Day makes the people the
[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:49.920]  single parents feel bad it makes you know same-sex parents feel bad because all
[02:54:49.920 --> 02:54:53.840]  of the all the cards and all the commercials are about a man and a
[02:54:53.840 --> 02:54:59.400]  woman and that's bad so they're trying to literally tear apart the basic
[02:54:59.400 --> 02:55:04.760]  foundation of society which is the nuclear family and with so many children
[02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:08.840]  being raised by single parents who were raised by single parents who were raised
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:14.040]  by single parents being raised by social media now today being so disconnected
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:19.480]  from the traditional value structure and teaching systems of the family we're
[02:55:19.480 --> 02:55:24.160]  dealing with rudderless people and the IQs are physically dropping people are
[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:27.640]  becoming extremely stupid so those of us that have a brain we see this and it's
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:31.640]  asinine but Acosta can show the same video and say I didn't touch her and he
[02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:35.960]  is touching her he's it pushing and pulling away and they're so brainwashed
[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:39.560]  they just go okay he didn't touch her and it's doctored video even though it's
[02:55:39.560 --> 02:55:45.120]  not I mean this is just incredible the fact that CNN says they're the most
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:49.560]  trusted name and is everything is the opposite it is like a bizarro world they
[02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:54.440]  accuse Trump of being divisive they accuse Trump of inciting hatred name a
[02:55:54.440 --> 02:55:58.160]  Trump supporter who's not a little bit anxious to walk down the street or go
[02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:02.400]  into a bar wearing a make America great again hat or a Trump shirt you're
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:08.200]  literally putting yourself at risk name a liberal who is concerned about wearing
[02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:12.280]  you know some leftist Bernie shirt nobody cares somebody might snicker at them
[02:56:12.280 --> 02:56:16.040]  that's it but they're not going to be put in physical danger they are the ones
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:21.160]  causing the problems they're undermining our culture our country our holidays the
[02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:27.560]  family it is an all-out assault and it is a mental health crisis and throughout
[02:56:27.560 --> 02:56:31.840]  history certain cultures have done really strange things and we look back at
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:35.000]  them and we're we wonder how could somebody conceive of doing that like
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:38.840]  stretching out their lips and putting the plates in there stretching out their
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:44.120]  necks footbinding in China human human sacrifice by the Aztecs cutting their
[02:56:44.120 --> 02:56:47.280]  children's hearts out crazy getting charged and they make people do more
[02:56:47.280 --> 02:56:50.800]  and more and more until the lemmings are all throwing their kids off cliffs to
[02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:54.640]  booga-ganuga and every culture goes crazy sometime and you're right we've gone
[02:56:54.640 --> 02:57:00.440]  crazy but it's being scientifically directed to sabotage us and you know I
[02:57:00.440 --> 02:57:04.360]  thought with the saying you probably put it better than I but liberal leftist
[02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:09.520]  aren't Americans they really aren't their ethos is hating the nation state
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:15.120]  hating success hating the family but it's beyond that leftist are our demons
[02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:20.320]  and have you noticed that every Christian is immune to the liberal pathogen
[02:57:20.320 --> 02:57:24.160]  Christians are the patriots who love America love the Constitution love their
[02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:28.520]  family love their neighbor as themselves even as flawed as we are we are still
[02:57:28.520 --> 02:57:31.920]  adhering to that goal mark I know you gotta go but do five more minutes with us
[02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:34.640]  and watch this coming I want you to finish the key because it's true I've
[02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:37.840]  always been a Christian but now it's totally clear it's a fight between good
[02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:42.200]  and evil period mark dice is our guess we're five more than Paul Watson stay

[02:59:10.480 --> 02:59:14.920]  from the break but the globalists now want to target where the resistance came
[02:59:14.920 --> 02:59:19.520]  from so that we're not pesky in the future I want to be troublesome and
[02:59:19.520 --> 02:59:24.400]  pesky I want to keep going I want to make them do the ultimate not just

[02:59:53.960 --> 03:00:04.960]  we want your soul
[03:00:04.960 --> 03:00:12.960]  defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[03:00:14.960 --> 03:00:18.960]  Mr. President will you stop calling us the enemy of the people sir?
[03:00:18.960 --> 03:00:26.960]  Mr. President will you stop calling the press the enemy of the people sir?
[03:00:31.960 --> 03:00:36.960]  everybody thank you Mr. President Mr. President if there is no collusion
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:40.960]  Mr. President if there is no collusion why does what is Gianni Giuliani
[03:00:40.960 --> 03:00:49.960]  consider is no collusion? Mr. President do you think other countries should not
[03:00:49.960 --> 03:00:54.960]  allow children to stay with their parents if they come in illegally?
[03:00:54.960 --> 03:00:57.960]  since you're attacking us can you give us a question?
[03:00:57.960 --> 03:01:02.960]  Mr. President-elect since you are attacking our news organization
[03:01:02.960 --> 03:01:07.840]  this goes on for quite a while it's at markdice.com in loving memory of
[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:12.840]  Jim Acosta's career the heckler and now they're suing it was CNN that got our
[03:01:12.840 --> 03:01:17.840]  credentials pulled that that you know that'd come down from people high level
[03:01:17.840 --> 03:01:21.440]  in the administration we had a contact as well through one of our crew we got our
[03:01:21.440 --> 03:01:26.320]  press passes we were totally polite and CNN said oh my god look they're in the
[03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:29.600]  building and guys banned and now they're suing because the heckler Jim Acosta but
[03:01:29.600 --> 03:01:31.720]  I don't want to go into that anymore I just thought I'd play that as Mark
[03:01:31.720 --> 03:01:35.320]  mentioned it mark in the three and a half minutes we have left it's a fight
[03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:39.880]  between good and evil I mean it really is these people desire to abort children
[03:01:39.880 --> 03:01:43.120]  they desire to molest children the Pope has now said don't investigate
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:48.000]  pedophilia he ordered it in the US this is not a Christian leader I mean they're
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:53.440]  really showing who they are it is a battle of between good and evil and it's
[03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:57.400]  just like the Bible says in the end times what's good will be considered evil
[03:01:57.400 --> 03:02:01.640]  and what's evil will be considered good you can see the beginning stages or
[03:02:01.640 --> 03:02:05.440]  perhaps even the middle phase of setting up the beast system where you can't buy
[03:02:05.440 --> 03:02:09.880]  and sell unless you worship the beast because if they're gonna ban people from
[03:02:09.880 --> 03:02:13.960]  doing commerce ban you from social media ban you're ban you from doing banking
[03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:17.560]  ban you from talking on the phone because they don't like what you say
[03:02:17.560 --> 03:02:20.960]  people aren't going to speak out a lot of people are gonna see what happened to
[03:02:20.960 --> 03:02:25.160]  you and see what happens to others and so oh I'm not gonna say anything I don't
[03:02:25.160 --> 03:02:30.040]  want to get my on shut down and that's what they're setting up now and it's
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:34.880]  interesting because Christians are spiritually immune to this madness
[03:02:34.880 --> 03:02:38.440]  Christians are the ones who've been warning about this Christians are the
[03:02:38.440 --> 03:02:43.120]  ones who are watching this unfold and and denouncing it for what it is a
[03:02:43.120 --> 03:02:49.720]  spiritual sickness because the leftists they hate God they hate the family they
[03:02:49.720 --> 03:02:55.760]  hate America you see them chanting you know no US no borders no Trump no USA at
[03:02:55.760 --> 03:02:59.520]  all whatever their chant is they don't like the country they don't like our
[03:02:59.520 --> 03:03:03.760]  culture they don't like our bill of rights they want a mob rule they hate
[03:03:03.760 --> 03:03:07.880]  their freedom of speech they hate the Second Amendment they hate a child by a
[03:03:07.880 --> 03:03:14.320]  jury of your peers they are the enemies of America they're they're the enemies
[03:03:14.320 --> 03:03:19.920]  of humanity now from Fox News to CNN they're saying you will take chips you
[03:03:19.920 --> 03:03:24.640]  will accept it I mean they're literally like following the revelation but as an
[03:03:24.640 --> 03:03:29.520]  owner's manual they're following 1984 but as an owner's manual and that's why
[03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:32.800]  they're trying to create an artificially intelligent God and you know you can
[03:03:32.800 --> 03:03:37.920]  you can really go way down the rabbit hole aside from just the typical cultural
[03:03:37.920 --> 03:03:43.560]  insanity and the political problems to what their ultimate goal is is to create
[03:03:43.560 --> 03:03:48.960]  an artificially intelligent system to wire humans into it to turn mankind you
[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:52.640]  wrote about this you wrote about this 15 years ago we did because you're going
[03:03:52.640 --> 03:03:56.400]  out their own statements now Elon Musk talks like Mark Dicer all shows and so
[03:03:56.400 --> 03:03:59.720]  they have to take me off the air that's how to restrict you because people are
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:03.680]  going to go away they warned us of all this I wrote a book about this called the
[03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:07.560]  resistance manifesto 2005 that was when the resistance was fighting against the
[03:04:07.560 --> 03:04:11.400]  New World Order not the foot soldiers of it and there was a whole chapter in there
[03:04:11.400 --> 03:04:16.800]  on artificial intelligence transhumanism robot soldiers and I was
[03:04:16.800 --> 03:04:19.880]  laughed at people said oh you just watched too many Terminator movies and
[03:04:19.880 --> 03:04:25.840]  now we have Atlas the robot dogs and the the humanoid robot being manufactured
[03:04:25.840 --> 03:04:30.760]  and that's just what they're showing us mark dice mark dice calm your new book is
[03:04:30.760 --> 03:04:33.480]  already shooting up the charts yeah there it is on screen mark Scott at in

[03:04:49.440 --> 03:04:54.840]  be in studio in about an hour for the war run with Owen Schreuer the globalists
[03:04:54.840 --> 03:04:58.520]  know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of
[03:04:58.520 --> 03:05:03.520]  the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it
[03:05:03.520 --> 03:05:08.320]  literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and
[03:05:08.320 --> 03:05:13.240]  viewers the best idea in the world we've gone through two permutations first
[03:05:13.240 --> 03:05:17.440]  seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist
[03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:21.280]  tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals of
[03:05:21.280 --> 03:05:26.280]  pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due to the
[03:05:26.280 --> 03:05:30.760]  establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the
[03:05:30.760 --> 03:05:35.000]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others
[03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:38.880]  showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds two
[03:05:38.880 --> 03:05:44.640]  forms of iodine and vitamin C it supercharges it and makes it even more
[03:05:44.640 --> 03:05:49.080]  bioavailable ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it
[03:05:49.080 --> 03:05:55.600]  it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at m4slife.com
[03:06:00.560 --> 03:06:11.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so
[03:06:11.160 --> 03:06:20.080]  does he live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[03:06:20.080 --> 03:06:25.920]  major newspapers are running headlines like orange buffoon in the White House
[03:06:25.920 --> 03:06:30.040]  tells us vote shouldn't be counted yeah not when they show up in 18 wheelers but
[03:06:30.040 --> 03:06:33.360]  Democratic Party operatives that literally work for move on.org and
[03:06:33.360 --> 03:06:38.600]  George Soros and Hillary are doing it I mean this is just insane this will be
[03:06:38.600 --> 03:06:41.960]  counting forever now in these special Democrat districts and just they'll get
[03:06:41.960 --> 03:06:45.960]  as many votes as they need to overturn shenna races hot races they're doing it
[03:06:45.960 --> 03:06:50.920]  they're stealing the country right now as the president prepares a major shakeup

[03:07:40.880 --> 03:07:49.760]  water filtration is the best out there we carry two brands and the other brands
[03:07:49.760 --> 03:07:54.320]  great to procure their apples and oranges like this one does this chemical
[03:07:54.320 --> 03:07:59.280]  down to 99999999 you know whatever and this one does it to 9999 and it's
[03:07:59.280 --> 03:08:03.480]  summer better at this or better that they're they're both excellent but
[03:08:03.480 --> 03:08:08.640]  normally on Alexa pure pro that's their biggest nice stainless steel system
[03:08:08.640 --> 03:08:13.640]  gravity fed system is 240 something bucks that's a great deal leading
[03:08:13.640 --> 03:08:17.720]  competitors for something of this quality or $300 $400 they're doing it
[03:08:17.720 --> 03:08:22.000]  because they ordered so many of these they don't want to pay for the inventory
[03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:26.400]  at the end of year because you know most states and the feds charge you for
[03:08:26.400 --> 03:08:30.360]  inventory that's everybody tries to always sell cars or whatever it is by
[03:08:30.360 --> 03:08:37.800]  the end of the year they ordered too many and so there's they're giving them to
[03:08:37.800 --> 03:08:42.200]  us at their cost that that's basically $90 something dollars and then we're
[03:08:42.200 --> 03:08:47.760]  just tagging on 20 something bucks so that we can find our operation you cannot
[03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:51.320]  no one has ever done anything like this for gravity fed filters the other
[03:08:51.320 --> 03:08:56.400]  companies out there I could tell you're absolute crap okay they're crap that's why
[03:08:56.400 --> 03:09:00.800]  I mean I can have them all for sponsors I can whatever no I won't do it Alexa pure
[03:09:00.800 --> 03:09:10.960]  breeze and we're going to pull is put it back on screen 100 $127 right now you

[03:09:34.640 --> 03:09:40.000]  their place filters you cannot beat this deal that is at cost they're selling it
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:46.200]  to us at cost for like $96 or something and then we're making $30 on it that's
[03:09:46.200 --> 03:09:51.840]  insane in four store.com in fourslife.com and they've got a couple thousand
[03:09:51.840 --> 03:09:55.800]  extra that they think that they consult this price once they think that they've
[03:09:55.800 --> 03:09:58.360]  sold enough word then they can go back to regular price in the end of the year
[03:09:58.360 --> 03:10:02.600]  they will so we've been authorized to sell 2,000 of these at this price I
[03:10:02.600 --> 03:10:07.920]  suggest you take advantage of it I personally am buying a bunch of them for
[03:10:07.920 --> 03:10:12.640]  friends and family because I get them for like 96 the actual cost but still this
[03:10:12.640 --> 03:10:17.880]  is insane in four store.com Alexa Pure Pro their biggest bass the
[03:10:17.880 --> 03:10:22.240]  competitors 350 400 then they discounted 300 and you know and these
[03:10:22.240 --> 03:10:26.440]  other companies are putting 50 bucks into them now these are amazing systems
[03:10:26.440 --> 03:10:30.440]  these are the best in four store.com or AAA 2533139 a bunch of the big
[03:10:30.440 --> 03:10:34.000]  specials are about to end as well Paul thanks for all your great work my
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:37.840]  friend it's been a busy week for everybody I know you've always got the
[03:10:37.840 --> 03:10:42.960]  most important intel to cover so Paul Watson take it away thanks Alex yeah
[03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:47.440]  again we're delving back into delusion and reality in the aftermath of this
[03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:51.280]  Jim Acosta controversy where they said he never touched her even though the
[03:10:51.280 --> 03:10:54.960]  video all the videos clearly show that he did touch her we also had this big
[03:10:54.960 --> 03:11:00.000]  story a few days ago which kind of got glossed over and when it happened where
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:05.680]  PayPal had to ban both Antifa and the proud boys after this situation
[03:11:05.680 --> 03:11:10.840]  outside took a Carlson's home because again they tried to a shoe blame from
[03:11:10.840 --> 03:11:14.720]  Antifa by claiming that it wasn't a single organization of course it is an
[03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:18.880]  organization you have several different chapters of Antifa in many cases they
[03:11:18.880 --> 03:11:23.840]  were the same clothes the same uniforms within these individual chapters so
[03:11:23.840 --> 03:11:28.840]  PayPal banned a bunch of Antifa groups alongside a bunch of proud boy chapters
[03:11:28.840 --> 03:11:33.440]  and then we had think progress come out with this narrative which has been
[03:11:33.440 --> 03:11:39.520]  replicated by several other left-wing publications the Antifa has never engaged
[03:11:39.520 --> 03:11:45.280]  in violence that Antifa literally never attacks anyone this is the article from
[03:11:45.280 --> 03:11:49.360]  think progress which again is another George Soros front group PayPal draws
[03:11:49.360 --> 03:11:54.920]  controversy for banning Antifa alongside far right proud boys so again
[03:11:54.920 --> 03:11:58.680]  even though we warned all along that this sensorious climate where people get
[03:11:58.680 --> 03:12:02.040]  de-platformed where people lose their PayPal accounts where they lose their
[03:12:02.040 --> 03:12:06.240]  bank accounts is eventually going to have to affect both sides they're still
[03:12:06.240 --> 03:12:11.200]  defending the far left fringe extremists it's the distinction I make over and
[03:12:11.200 --> 03:12:15.240]  over again on the right when there are far right violent extremists we distance
[03:12:15.240 --> 03:12:18.960]  ourselves from them we don't want to be associated with them the left doesn't
[03:12:18.960 --> 03:12:23.680]  they make excuses for them time and time again this is a quote out of the print
[03:12:23.680 --> 03:12:28.040]  think progress article which is up right now members of the proud boys have
[03:12:28.040 --> 03:12:32.480]  been arrested for the violent attacks but there's no evidence of equivalent
[03:12:32.480 --> 03:12:39.240]  violence by Antifa organizations that is complete bonk that is a complete lie
[03:12:39.240 --> 03:12:45.800]  the very reason proud boys got banned from PayPal sprang from that incident in
[03:12:45.800 --> 03:12:50.040]  New York after the event at the Metropolitan Republican Club where
[03:12:50.040 --> 03:12:55.640]  Antifa and proud boys became engaged in a brawl in a fight now proud boys
[03:12:55.640 --> 03:12:59.800]  finished that they basically beat them up and won the fight but who started it
[03:12:59.800 --> 03:13:05.480]  well according to news reports according to the NYPD Antifa started the fight
[03:13:05.480 --> 03:13:11.040]  they physically confronted proud boys members they threw a bottle at them as
[03:13:11.040 --> 03:13:15.360]  they were coming out of that event so the very violent confrontation that was
[03:13:15.360 --> 03:13:20.720]  used as an excuse to ban the proud boys was started by Antifa and yet you've
[03:13:20.720 --> 03:13:24.720]  got these left-wing groups out claiming that not only did Antifa were they
[03:13:24.720 --> 03:13:29.200]  completely blameless in that incident that they've never engaged in any
[03:13:29.200 --> 03:13:33.600]  violent confrontations literally you can go back to August here's a headline out
[03:13:33.600 --> 03:13:39.000]  of the Oregonian he brought an American flag to protest fascism in Portland then
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:45.000]  Antifa attacked him so they even attack their own people this was a Bernie
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:50.200]  Sanders supporter this was the August event where Antifa and proud boys and
[03:13:50.200 --> 03:13:53.880]  these other right-wing groups clashed they ended up smacking his him over the
[03:13:53.880 --> 03:13:58.800]  head with a pole beating him to the ground because he had an Antifa sorry a
[03:13:58.800 --> 03:14:03.080]  US flag you can't have a US flag that's very triggering they will beat the
[03:14:03.080 --> 03:14:06.440]  crap out of you oh but no they don't engage in any violence whatsoever
[03:14:06.440 --> 03:14:12.000]  according to think progress you can go back to 2017 of course we had the
[03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:16.800]  incident at UC Berkeley during the Milo speech before and after where they
[03:14:16.800 --> 03:14:21.560]  literally burned down the campus through rocks at police officers injuring
[03:14:21.560 --> 03:14:27.000]  many of them and pepper sprayed women in the face we all remember the horrific
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:30.720]  footage but again according to think progress according to the left-wing
[03:14:30.720 --> 03:14:35.320]  media none of this ever happened Antifa's never violently attacked anyone
[03:14:35.320 --> 03:14:39.960]  all the footage you see of them kicking people on the floor beating people over
[03:14:39.960 --> 03:14:45.720]  the heads with clubs the professor the Antifa professor smacking someone over
[03:14:45.720 --> 03:14:49.200]  the head with a bike lock which he basically got away with they tried to
[03:14:49.200 --> 03:14:53.040]  take him to court he got away with it none of that ever happened according to
[03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:57.480]  the leftist media only right wing organizations or groups ever engage in
[03:14:57.480 --> 03:15:01.680]  any kind of violence or any kind of civil unrest so again it goes back to
[03:15:01.680 --> 03:15:06.600]  this delusion versus reality bubble that we've got right now in American
[03:15:06.600 --> 03:15:11.640]  politics where Jim Acosta clearly touches a White House intern it's on tape
[03:15:11.640 --> 03:15:16.280]  it's on all the tapes it's on the doctored tape which isn't even doctored
[03:15:16.280 --> 03:15:20.160]  as I explained a million times until I blew in the face it's also on the
[03:15:20.160 --> 03:15:24.320]  original CNN tape it's also on the original c-span tape yet they've
[03:15:24.320 --> 03:15:28.400]  literally filed a lawsuit claiming that he never touched her hundreds of
[03:15:28.400 --> 03:15:32.440]  mainstream media publications of file reports claiming he never touched her
[03:15:32.440 --> 03:15:36.960]  don't believe you're lying guys even though it's right there on the tape now
[03:15:36.960 --> 03:15:41.640]  they're doing the same thing to excuse Antifa the clear pattern of violence
[03:15:41.640 --> 03:15:45.800]  they've engaged in the past two plus years we'll be back to cover this and
[03:15:45.800 --> 03:15:51.520]  more on the outside of show live breaking news info was calm we'll be back

[03:19:56.440 --> 03:20:02.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:20:02.040 --> 03:20:26.040]  we're gonna hit on a number of stories for the rest of this hour including a
[03:20:26.040 --> 03:20:30.480]  big story that's just gone up on info wars.com about a professor warning that
[03:20:30.480 --> 03:20:37.000]  Amazon Alexa and all these other home devices including Google's device are
[03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:41.080]  recording your conversations in real time it's not consensual it's not when
[03:20:41.080 --> 03:20:45.240]  you just give them the cue Alexa what's the weather blah blah blah they're
[03:20:45.240 --> 03:20:50.120]  recording your conversations in real time now we have a top professor warning
[03:20:50.120 --> 03:20:54.360]  people about that it's got nowhere near the news attention it deserves and I
[03:20:54.360 --> 03:20:59.880]  guess the overarching narrative for today's show is media hoaxes we have the
[03:20:59.880 --> 03:21:05.040]  media hoax that Antifa didn't deserve to be banned that Smash Racism didn't
[03:21:05.040 --> 03:21:08.680]  deserve to be banned who by the way Smash Racism the group that organized
[03:21:08.680 --> 03:21:13.360]  that harassment campaign against Tucker Carlson targeting his house where his
[03:21:13.360 --> 03:21:17.320]  wife and children literally had to hide in a pantry while calling the police
[03:21:17.320 --> 03:21:21.240]  because they were running up and banging on the door and vandalizing his
[03:21:21.240 --> 03:21:25.920]  property they're now saying that basically that was nothing they didn't
[03:21:25.920 --> 03:21:30.280]  even bang on the door this Smash Racism group is still active on Instagram on
[03:21:30.280 --> 03:21:34.280]  Facebook they've been banned on Twitter having docs numerous people in the past
[03:21:34.280 --> 03:21:38.200]  but they're still active on all these other platforms so isn't it interesting
[03:21:38.200 --> 03:21:42.880]  that in the case of info wars they all coordinated to ban info wars at basically
[03:21:42.880 --> 03:21:48.320]  the same time within the same 12 hour time period but not with these anti for
[03:21:48.320 --> 03:21:51.920]  groups they only get banned by sole platforms and eventually many cases
[03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:57.080]  find their way back but now you've got the media hoax narrative that Antifa have
[03:21:57.080 --> 03:22:00.840]  never engaged in violence that's complete bunk we've disproven that time
[03:22:00.840 --> 03:22:05.680]  and time again you've got the whole Jim Acosta media hoax that he never touched
[03:22:05.680 --> 03:22:10.280]  the White House in turn when he clearly did and then on top of that you've had
[03:22:10.280 --> 03:22:15.960]  a three-year media hoax about refugees and migrants coming into Europe that
[03:22:15.960 --> 03:22:21.000]  they are child refugees when in the majority the majority of cases they're
[03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:25.880]  not and now we have this which is another big story again picked up by RT
[03:22:25.880 --> 03:22:30.880]  picked up by a couple of right-wing media outlets but getting nowhere near like
[03:22:30.880 --> 03:22:35.320]  the attention it deserves this is out of RT NGO expose teaching migrants how to
[03:22:35.320 --> 03:22:41.280]  trick effing stupid EU border guards this is secretly recorded footage from one
[03:22:41.280 --> 03:22:46.760]  of these top NGOs that's been helping these refugees who aren't refugees get
[03:22:46.760 --> 03:22:52.720]  into Greece get into Europe via a process of complete and utter fraud and
[03:22:52.720 --> 03:22:56.120]  as a result of this expose they've actually had to basically delete their
[03:22:56.120 --> 03:23:00.480]  entire social media presence to save face it remains to be seen whether they'll
[03:23:00.480 --> 03:23:06.640]  try and crawl back the mainstream media is giving them cover by not reporting on
[03:23:06.640 --> 03:23:10.280]  this so they probably will try and crawl back eventually the article states a
[03:23:10.280 --> 03:23:14.520]  group that helped over 15,000 refugees and migrants to get into Europe has been
[03:23:14.520 --> 03:23:18.480]  caught on tape admitting to systematically training asylum asylum
[03:23:18.480 --> 03:23:23.520]  seekers to exploit screening interviews by feigning trauma and persecution
[03:23:23.520 --> 03:23:29.120]  Ariel Ricker this is the woman caught on a secret recording the executive
[03:23:29.120 --> 03:23:33.680]  director of advocates abroad the major nonprofit NGO which provides legal aid
[03:23:33.680 --> 03:23:37.720]  to migrants has been caught on tape openly discussing how she teaches
[03:23:37.720 --> 03:23:44.320]  refugees to lie to border agents now again they they brag on their website
[03:23:44.320 --> 03:23:47.200]  remains to be seen whether they'll remove their website temporarily that
[03:23:47.200 --> 03:23:51.600]  they've helped as many as 15,000 migrants but in this footage basically she
[03:23:51.600 --> 03:23:56.160]  admits that they teach them to act they teach them to act like they're in
[03:23:56.160 --> 03:24:00.920]  trauma like they're fleeing war when they're not fleeing war telling them
[03:24:00.920 --> 03:24:06.440]  what to say to border guards to trick them into letting them in to lie to them
[03:24:06.440 --> 03:24:11.840]  absolutely shocking footage after this footage was released initially
[03:24:11.840 --> 03:24:16.760]  advocates abroad put out a tweet stating advocates abroad was made aware of a
[03:24:16.760 --> 03:24:21.000]  video that shows a heavily edited version of an informal conversation that
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:25.720]  was secretly filmed and without consent so again what do they run to every time
[03:24:25.720 --> 03:24:31.440]  they get caught oh it was heavily edited now cutting out segments of the video
[03:24:31.440 --> 03:24:35.880]  and putting the important bits out publicly is not doctoring it's not
[03:24:35.880 --> 03:24:40.680]  heavily editing all news organizations do it you cannot run away from your
[03:24:40.680 --> 03:24:45.720]  fraud from your criminality by claiming a video was edited this tweet went on to
[03:24:45.720 --> 03:24:50.280]  say the video is being used for political right-wing effect so they came
[03:24:50.280 --> 03:24:55.240]  out hours after this broke claiming that it was all a hoax that the video was
[03:24:55.240 --> 03:24:59.640]  doctored that it was fake it wasn't fake just as in the Jim Acosta situation and
[03:24:59.640 --> 03:25:04.120]  when all these other big groups think Oxford University was one even the UN
[03:25:04.120 --> 03:25:07.840]  came out and had to distance themselves from this group they deleted their
[03:25:07.840 --> 03:25:13.800]  Twitter page they deleted their Facebook page with 140,000 followers so again
[03:25:13.800 --> 03:25:18.680]  they basically de-platformed themselves perhaps in the hope that once this goes
[03:25:18.680 --> 03:25:23.880]  away they can crawl back without anyone noticing but their top individual is on
[03:25:23.880 --> 03:25:30.280]  tape saying we train these people to fake trauma to lie to border agents to
[03:25:30.280 --> 03:25:34.400]  get in and it's all being exposed but again hardly any media is picking up on
[03:25:34.400 --> 03:25:39.080]  it which reminds me of another related controversy which actually happened in
[03:25:39.080 --> 03:25:44.800]  2016 this is out of the independent Gary Linnaker receives torrent of criticism
[03:25:44.800 --> 03:25:49.840]  after calling response to child refugees arrival hideously racist so
[03:25:49.840 --> 03:25:54.480]  basically if you remember the story a bunch of child refugees arrived in the
[03:25:54.480 --> 03:26:00.920]  UK from the jungle camping Calais France they were obviously literally like 30
[03:26:00.920 --> 03:26:05.400]  years old plus they had full beard some of them some of them were probably even
[03:26:05.400 --> 03:26:10.080]  over 40 when myself and others pointed out that these were obviously not child
[03:26:10.080 --> 03:26:14.840]  refugees they were faking their ages to get into the country we were demonized
[03:26:14.840 --> 03:26:20.520]  we were called hideously racist and then what what came out almost two years
[03:26:20.520 --> 03:26:26.760]  later this story out the Daily Mail truth about child refugees two-thirds
[03:26:26.760 --> 03:26:31.360]  quizzed about their age are found to be adults official report reveals after
[03:26:31.360 --> 03:26:35.440]  almost 3,000 people claiming to be unaccompanied minors apply for asylum in
[03:26:35.440 --> 03:26:39.960]  a year the article states nearly two-thirds of child refugees who were
[03:26:39.960 --> 03:26:43.560]  questioned about their real age after coming to Britain were found to be
[03:26:43.560 --> 03:26:48.960]  adults two-thirds of them and if you look at the pictures in that Daily Mail
[03:26:48.960 --> 03:26:53.720]  article the first picture on the article blatantly not a child probably an
[03:26:53.720 --> 03:26:57.480]  adult nearing the age of 40 if you scroll down you'll see the first picture
[03:26:57.480 --> 03:27:02.920]  there right there that is not a child okay we were called racist for saying
[03:27:02.920 --> 03:27:07.960]  that was not a child in 2016 less than two years later the official report came
[03:27:07.960 --> 03:27:13.480]  out two-thirds of them were imagine my shot lying about their age and what
[03:27:13.480 --> 03:27:18.200]  happened next we had this report out of the BBC just last week Ipswich school
[03:27:18.200 --> 03:27:23.720]  reports pupil aged 30 to home office this was a secondary school a high
[03:27:23.720 --> 03:27:27.560]  school of teenagers there was a 30-year-old guy in the maths class
[03:27:27.560 --> 03:27:32.280]  basically joking to all the other kids about how he was an adult how he lied
[03:27:32.280 --> 03:27:37.120]  and tricked his way into the country by claiming to be a child refugee again at
[03:27:37.120 --> 03:27:40.320]  the time the media report all this completely above board that there was
[03:27:40.320 --> 03:27:46.280]  no deception going on it was a gigantic media hoax same thing in Sweden again
[03:27:46.280 --> 03:27:52.040]  BBC reported December 2017 Sweden child migrant tests reveal many adults they
[03:27:52.040 --> 03:27:56.840]  had a forensic investigation Sweden's national forensic medicine agency they
[03:27:56.840 --> 03:28:02.600]  found that the I think it was over it was 84% I believe from this article
[03:28:02.600 --> 03:28:08.960]  actually 79% that they were not children they were over the age of 18 they
[03:28:08.960 --> 03:28:12.480]  lied from the very beginning everyone who pointed that out at the very
[03:28:12.480 --> 03:28:17.600]  beginning was called a racist you had the same thing in Denmark an article out
[03:28:17.600 --> 03:28:21.560]  of the express no wonder our politicians banned age test majority of child
[03:28:21.560 --> 03:28:26.360]  refugees checked our adults that was out of Denmark where three-quarters of
[03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:31.680]  those posing as child refugees were proven forensically to be adults so
[03:28:31.680 --> 03:28:36.040]  it's media hoax after media hoax after media hoax we're right we're called
[03:28:36.040 --> 03:28:40.520]  racist we're demonized for telling the truth and when it comes out they just
[03:28:40.520 --> 03:28:45.160]  want the story to slowly vanish and go away absolutely incredible levels of
[03:28:45.160 --> 03:28:49.840]  deception at every level and the media is complicit in that we'll be back at the

[03:32:04.560 --> 03:32:08.720]  population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best
[03:32:08.720 --> 03:32:13.680]  iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based
[03:32:13.680 --> 03:32:17.520]  iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block
[03:32:17.520 --> 03:32:21.280]  us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure
[03:32:21.280 --> 03:32:25.920]  nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible now due to the
[03:32:25.920 --> 03:32:30.420]  establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the
[03:32:30.420 --> 03:32:34.960]  deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed

[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:52.920]  want to get into where CNN obviously they've come out with this lawsuit very
[03:34:52.920 --> 03:34:57.440]  interesting report on CNN.com obviously that they made themselves the top story
[03:34:57.440 --> 03:35:01.200]  on their own website today CNN has filed a lawsuit against the Trump
[03:35:01.200 --> 03:35:05.120]  administration now this is where it gets interesting the statement they put out
[03:35:05.120 --> 03:35:09.600]  read quote it demands the return of White House credentials of CNN's chief
[03:35:09.600 --> 03:35:13.400]  White House correspondent Jim Acosta the wrongful revocation of these
[03:35:13.400 --> 03:35:17.360]  credentials violate CNN and Acosta's First Amendment rights of freedom of the
[03:35:17.360 --> 03:35:23.120]  press and their Fifth Amendment rights to due process so now CNN's all but her
[03:35:23.120 --> 03:35:28.480]  and worried about people being revoked of the right of freedom of the press now
[03:35:28.480 --> 03:35:32.760]  Jim Acosta is not banned from the White House let's make that clear he has to
[03:35:32.760 --> 03:35:37.320]  get permission before re-entering the White House like every other reporter who
[03:35:37.320 --> 03:35:42.000]  doesn't have what they call this hard pass his hard pass where he gets to go in
[03:35:42.000 --> 03:35:47.120]  and out as he pleases has been revoked as a result of his behavior during that
[03:35:47.120 --> 03:35:52.160]  press conference last week but this is the irony they're complaining about the
[03:35:52.160 --> 03:35:57.040]  rights of freedom of press being removed this is the same organization with
[03:35:57.040 --> 03:36:01.880]  Oliver Dorsey and Brian Stelter and others that lobbied for a solid six
[03:36:01.880 --> 03:36:08.960]  months six months to get a competing news network banned yeeted removed
[03:36:08.960 --> 03:36:14.760]  de-platformed de-personed from all social media they literally put reporters on
[03:36:14.760 --> 03:36:19.680]  special assignments to lobby corporations to ban Alex Jones to ban
[03:36:19.680 --> 03:36:24.800]  info wars in the end with obviously widespread success so now they're all
[03:36:24.800 --> 03:36:28.800]  worried about freedom of the press having spent much of the past year
[03:36:28.800 --> 03:36:34.840]  campaigning lobbying abusing their platform to ban other press outlets
[03:36:34.840 --> 03:36:40.440]  isn't that ironic now this is the article CNN sues President Trump and White
[03:36:40.440 --> 03:36:44.960]  House for banning reporter Jim Acosta and again it goes into it the lawsuit which
[03:36:44.960 --> 03:36:49.520]  I've actually read mentions the so-called doctored videotape which was
[03:36:49.520 --> 03:36:53.840]  never doctored and the lawsuit is linked from a Breitbart article called full
[03:36:53.840 --> 03:36:59.360]  document CNN's lawsuit to restore Jim Acosta's White House credentials and in
[03:36:59.360 --> 03:37:03.640]  that lawsuit which can read on scribe they've posted it they literally claim
[03:37:03.640 --> 03:37:08.880]  they're now claiming having initially said in Washington Post and a hundred
[03:37:08.880 --> 03:37:13.040]  other media outlets big media outlets claiming that this video was definitely
[03:37:13.040 --> 03:37:17.480]  doctored and that this video was used to remove Acosta's press access they're
[03:37:17.480 --> 03:37:22.560]  now saying it was apparently doctored so those are the words used in the exact
[03:37:22.560 --> 03:37:27.280]  lawsuit apparently doctored they mentioned info wars they mentioned that
[03:37:27.280 --> 03:37:33.120]  they basically say they got it from me but again trying to create trying to
[03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:38.280]  continue this giant media hoax that Jim Acosta did not touch a woman in fact they
[03:37:38.280 --> 03:37:43.480]  actually quote Reuters journalists they quote other journalists who say they
[03:37:43.480 --> 03:37:48.840]  were right there when it happened and they did not see Jim Acosta place his
[03:37:48.840 --> 03:37:53.200]  hands on the intern those are the exact words they use place his hands on the
[03:37:53.200 --> 03:37:58.440]  intern they quote Chuck Ross of the Daily Caller who was wrong and who wrote
[03:37:58.440 --> 03:38:02.400]  that there is quote plenty to criticize Acosta about but he did not place his
[03:38:02.400 --> 03:38:07.440]  hands on the intern it's ridiculous for anyone to suggest he did okay now let's
[03:38:07.440 --> 03:38:10.920]  roll the video you've obviously got it in the system right there of that very
[03:38:10.920 --> 03:38:15.440]  incident where he clearly places his hands on the White House intern they
[03:38:15.440 --> 03:38:21.040]  also quote another journalist Jeff Mason of Reuters he would see the video again
[03:38:21.040 --> 03:38:25.240]  the original video from C-SPAN not the quote doctored version which isn't
[03:38:25.240 --> 03:38:29.520]  doctored at all does he place his hands on a White House intern does he use his
[03:38:29.520 --> 03:38:34.320]  left hand to push down on hers yes he does it's right there in the video yet
[03:38:34.320 --> 03:38:38.520]  they're still claiming as part of this international media hoax that it never
[03:38:38.520 --> 03:38:44.160]  happened they quote Jeff Mason of Reuters a former president of WHCA who
[03:38:44.160 --> 03:38:48.640]  was seated next to Acosta at the press conference and quote did not witness him
[03:38:48.640 --> 03:38:53.040]  placing his hands on the young intern as the White House alleges he held on to
[03:38:53.040 --> 03:38:57.320]  the microphone as she reached for it yes he held on to the microphone with his
[03:38:57.320 --> 03:39:02.040]  right hand and using his left hand placed his hand on the White House
[03:39:02.040 --> 03:39:06.600]  intern you can see it in the CNN video you can see it in the C-SPAN video you
[03:39:06.600 --> 03:39:11.240]  don't even need to look at the video that I put out which wasn't doctored to see
[03:39:11.240 --> 03:39:16.160]  that that's a blatant reality they also talk about the audio being removed now
[03:39:16.160 --> 03:39:19.760]  this is something that Jimmy Kimmel mentioned I think it was three times
[03:39:19.760 --> 03:39:24.960]  during his monologue last weekend last week on I think it was Wednesday night
[03:39:24.960 --> 03:39:30.800]  or Thursday night again claiming that the video was doctored or edited because
[03:39:30.800 --> 03:39:35.720]  the audio from the moment where Acosta said I'm sorry ma'am had been removed
[03:39:35.720 --> 03:39:40.400]  well no again that's another complete misleading deception the audio from the
[03:39:40.400 --> 03:39:46.040]  entire clip had been removed because the original file was a GIF image and it was
[03:39:46.040 --> 03:39:53.440]  not a video file GIF images do not have audio contained that's basic anyone knows
[03:39:53.440 --> 03:39:58.280]  that anyone who's ever used the internet knows that so this lawsuit says in the
[03:39:58.280 --> 03:40:02.360]  original video Acosta's arm appears to move only as a response to a tussle for
[03:40:02.360 --> 03:40:05.520]  the microphone oh wait a minute you just said before he didn't place his hands on
[03:40:05.520 --> 03:40:10.640]  her now you're saying it was a tussle for the microphone what is a tussle okay
[03:40:10.640 --> 03:40:15.280]  a tussle is a physical coming together right so this lawsuit contradicts itself
[03:40:15.280 --> 03:40:20.400]  in the very next paragraph it continues his statement referring to Acosta
[03:40:20.400 --> 03:40:26.660]  pardon me ma'am is not included in the video sender shared so again they're
[03:40:26.660 --> 03:40:29.760]  attempting to claim that this was doctored which if you look at the
[03:40:29.760 --> 03:40:34.160]  definition of doctored it means to falsify which is again completely
[03:40:34.160 --> 03:40:38.000]  wrong they're claiming that the order the audio was removed as part of this
[03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:41.800]  doctoring as part of this deception when the audio was removed from the entire
[03:40:41.800 --> 03:40:47.560]  clip not just that moment they then quote counselor to the president Kelly
[03:40:47.560 --> 03:40:54.280]  and Conway who went on Fox News on Sunday and said admitted as they say that
[03:40:54.280 --> 03:40:59.400]  it had been sped up like they speed up replays in football now obviously she
[03:40:59.400 --> 03:41:04.680]  misspoke she meant to say slow down but they're not accounting for that fact
[03:41:04.680 --> 03:41:08.920]  where she clearly misspoke and meant to say slow down but again as a proven with
[03:41:08.920 --> 03:41:13.600]  the screenshots from the editing software nothing was slowed down nothing was
[03:41:13.600 --> 03:41:17.960]  sped up they can't seem to decide whether it was slowed down or sped up some
[03:41:17.960 --> 03:41:21.920]  people talk about frames being added some people talk about frames being
[03:41:21.920 --> 03:41:27.120]  removed they can't make up their own minds there was two forensic analysts who
[03:41:27.120 --> 03:41:32.120]  vice quoted in one of their articles again after having initially said that
[03:41:32.120 --> 03:41:35.800]  the video the video was doctored motherboard which is also a division of
[03:41:35.800 --> 03:41:40.840]  vice came out in an article and admitted forensic experts say the video was not
[03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:45.000]  doctored so they can't decide whether it's sped up or slowed down they're
[03:41:45.000 --> 03:41:48.360]  talking about audio being removed when there was no audio in the video to begin
[03:41:48.360 --> 03:41:52.560]  with because it was a gif image which doesn't contain audio so now in this
[03:41:52.560 --> 03:41:57.720]  lawsuit they're saying that it was quote apparently doctored so they're not
[03:41:57.720 --> 03:42:01.640]  even now solid on whether it was doctored or not or apparently altered as
[03:42:01.640 --> 03:42:06.040]  they say it wasn't altered in a way to deceive the only alteration was zooming
[03:42:06.040 --> 03:42:12.040]  in and as Trump said that's not doctoring I did an entire 8 minute video about it
[03:42:12.040 --> 03:42:16.600]  which you can see on YouTube so a cost doesn't have any divine right to be in
[03:42:16.600 --> 03:42:19.920]  the White House you can still ask for permission to be in the White House as
[03:42:19.920 --> 03:42:24.400]  Alex Jones said in a previous segment we had White House access at least to the
[03:42:24.400 --> 03:42:28.960]  press room for a brief amount of time CNN was one of the mainstream media
[03:42:28.960 --> 03:42:33.880]  organizations lobbying to have that press access revolt so again it's do as we say
[03:42:33.880 --> 03:42:38.720]  not as we do they lobbied for six months to have info was removed to have our
[03:42:38.720 --> 03:42:44.560]  rights to press freedom yanked taken away then Acosta's gets his removed for
[03:42:44.560 --> 03:42:48.880]  justifiable reasons and it's a massive scandal no stop lying to your audience
[03:42:48.880 --> 03:42:53.720]  stop deceiving absolutely incredible will be back live don't go away living in
[03:42:53.720 --> 03:42:58.600]  volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found
[03:42:58.600 --> 03:43:03.520]  here in Lelani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and
[03:43:03.520 --> 03:43:08.440]  we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[03:43:08.440 --> 03:43:12.920]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to
[03:43:12.920 --> 03:43:17.960]  unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[03:43:17.960 --> 03:43:23.360]  alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels
[03:43:23.360 --> 03:43:28.120]  of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from
[03:43:28.120 --> 03:43:32.560]  our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within
[03:43:32.560 --> 03:43:38.080]  safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns
[03:43:38.080 --> 03:43:43.200]  out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've
[03:43:43.200 --> 03:43:47.720]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[03:43:47.720 --> 03:43:53.520]  but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it we

[03:47:13.600 --> 03:47:23.120]  and now your host Paul Joseph Watson MEP Nigel Farage has called out Angela
[03:47:23.120 --> 03:47:27.640]  Merkel called on her to apologize for basically ruining German communities as
[03:47:27.640 --> 03:47:32.000]  a result of a disastrous open borders policy gonna go to that clip here in a
[03:47:32.000 --> 03:47:36.320]  second this of course comes off the back of President Macron of France with his
[03:47:36.320 --> 03:47:42.680]  pathetic and plummeting 26% approval rating remember this is the new so-called
[03:47:42.680 --> 03:47:47.440]  leader of Europe as Angela Merkel's political legacy crashes and burns he
[03:47:47.440 --> 03:47:52.400]  with his 26% approval rating is now lecturing Donald Trump about how things
[03:47:52.400 --> 03:47:57.680]  should be run by how evil nationalism is while his own former interior minister
[03:47:57.680 --> 03:48:01.880]  basically says that within France within five years in France is going to be mass
[03:48:01.880 --> 03:48:06.440]  civil unrest dislocation of society you know perhaps he should concentrate on
[03:48:06.440 --> 03:48:09.760]  problems within his own country before getting up and lecturing Donald Trump
[03:48:09.760 --> 03:48:14.360]  we've got the French finance minister basically saying that Europe now needs
[03:48:14.360 --> 03:48:18.760]  to become an empire to challenge the United States we've got Angela Merkel
[03:48:18.760 --> 03:48:23.000]  and others pursuing and actually formalizing now an EU army which they
[03:48:23.000 --> 03:48:27.400]  promised they would never do so now Farage got up in front of the EU
[03:48:27.400 --> 03:48:31.800]  parliament and directly challenged as she sat there just a few feet away from
[03:48:31.800 --> 03:48:35.400]  him Angela Merkel here's the clip
[03:48:35.400 --> 03:48:40.200]  many of my Euro skeptic colleagues have been booing you this morning but they
[03:48:40.200 --> 03:48:43.800]  shouldn't be in a way because the British should be cheering you without
[03:48:43.800 --> 03:48:47.080]  you we've never have made it over the line we're Brexit I don't want to thank
[03:48:47.080 --> 03:48:51.720]  you very much for that and of course many of these Euro skeptic groups on the
[03:48:51.720 --> 03:48:55.080]  right the center of my left will come back here after the next European
[03:48:55.080 --> 03:49:00.520]  elections in huge numbers directly as a result of your immigration and asylum
[03:49:00.520 --> 03:49:07.800]  policy your weak and cope led to a huge migrant tide indeed a stampede that came
[03:49:07.800 --> 03:49:13.080]  across the Mediterranean young men coming from very different cultures who
[03:49:13.080 --> 03:49:16.920]  were not going to integrate young men none of whom would have qualified as
[03:49:16.920 --> 03:49:21.360]  being genuine refugees and I think in many ways we looked at it in the
[03:49:21.360 --> 03:49:25.520]  referendum and we said we don't want to be part of an increasingly German
[03:49:25.520 --> 03:49:30.520]  dominated European Union and we certainly don't want to pay the price for
[03:49:30.520 --> 03:49:35.520]  mrs. Merkel's errors and I believe having heard you today and listening to
[03:49:35.520 --> 03:49:40.360]  senior French politicians over the last couple of days that after us leaving the
[03:49:40.360 --> 03:49:44.960]  European Union is now indeed a liberation it's a European Union that
[03:49:44.960 --> 03:49:51.160]  we're told is now to become an empire a militarized European Union an undemocratic
[03:49:51.160 --> 03:49:57.800]  European Union a European Union that seeks to continually expand to the east
[03:49:57.800 --> 03:50:03.400]  a European Union that has launched a new Cold War against the United States of
[03:50:03.400 --> 03:50:10.240]  America a European Union that tries to rewrite history and I think a hundred
[03:50:10.240 --> 03:50:16.160]  years on from the Armistice we should be genuinely worried the idea that this
[03:50:16.160 --> 03:50:22.960]  new militarized Union is somehow a recipe for peace I suggest you will sit back
[03:50:22.960 --> 03:50:28.800]  and think a little bit more carefully maybe you should all reread history the
[03:50:28.800 --> 03:50:33.880]  European project was set up to stop German domination what you've seen today
[03:50:33.880 --> 03:50:42.080]  is a naked takeover bid so I think Brexit becomes a necessity after this and for
[03:50:42.080 --> 03:50:46.400]  the rest of the country mrs. Merkel you've had a long successful career but
[03:50:46.400 --> 03:50:50.720]  your political decision to open up the doors unconditionally is the worst
[03:50:50.720 --> 03:50:56.400]  decision we've seen in post-war politics in Europe is it not time for you at last
[03:50:56.400 --> 03:51:01.640]  to admit that you were wrong is it not time for you to say to German
[03:51:01.640 --> 03:51:06.160]  communities and many others I'm sorry for what I've done to you and the
[03:51:06.160 --> 03:51:12.760]  problems I've inflicted upon you for many decades to come that was Nigel
[03:51:12.760 --> 03:51:17.560]  Farage earlier today in the European Parliament calling out Angela Merkel now
[03:51:17.560 --> 03:51:21.160]  bear in mind that it was only back in September that the Bundesstag president
[03:51:21.160 --> 03:51:25.520]  Wolfgang Schaubel told Germans we had an article about this at the time that they
[03:51:25.520 --> 03:51:29.120]  could completely forget about these one million refugees and it's over one
[03:51:29.120 --> 03:51:32.960]  million and most of them aren't refugees who flooded into Germany over the past
[03:51:32.960 --> 03:51:36.520]  three years from ever returning to their home countries we've had violent crime
[03:51:36.520 --> 03:51:42.720]  in Germany rise over the last two years 90% of that violent crime rise is due to
[03:51:42.720 --> 03:51:46.360]  migrants according to the German government's own statistics they tried
[03:51:46.360 --> 03:51:49.800]  to call Trump out over that and say he was wrong just because he didn't put the
[03:51:49.800 --> 03:51:56.440]  word violent in front of crime but those are the facts now 67.1% of all
[03:51:56.440 --> 03:52:01.040]  sudden gang rapes were committed by foreign migrants these are new statistics
[03:52:01.040 --> 03:52:04.880]  out of Germany overwhelming majority of gang rapes in Germany committed by
[03:52:04.880 --> 03:52:09.280]  foreigners is the headline out of Voice of Europe the gang rape of German team
[03:52:09.280 --> 03:52:13.480]  by seven Syrians in Freiburg has made the issue a hot topic and now they've
[03:52:13.480 --> 03:52:18.760]  come to the conclusion from these latest stats that 67.1% of sudden gang
[03:52:18.760 --> 03:52:22.600]  rapes that's not planned gang rapes that's sudden gang rapes were committed
[03:52:22.600 --> 03:52:26.680]  by foreigners last year so they got a massive problem with violent crime
[03:52:26.680 --> 03:52:31.120]  they've got a massive problem with gang rapes as we see in virtually every other
[03:52:31.120 --> 03:52:35.280]  country Angela Merkel's political legacy is crashing and burning as a result of
[03:52:35.280 --> 03:52:39.720]  it but the consequences remain they're not doing anything to deport foreign
[03:52:39.720 --> 03:52:43.720]  migrants in many cases they're more lenient than actual German criminals
[03:52:43.720 --> 03:52:47.280]  in dealing with them we have another headline here out of Information
[03:52:47.280 --> 03:52:51.720]  Liberation we love you Angela migrants say they're trekking to Europe because
[03:52:51.720 --> 03:52:56.000]  they love the lifestyle newly released video shows a group of Pakistani and
[03:52:56.000 --> 03:52:59.280]  Bangladeshi migrants explaining to an interviewer why they're working to
[03:52:59.280 --> 03:53:03.200]  illegally immigrate to Western Europe through the new Balkan route one man
[03:53:03.200 --> 03:53:06.480]  from Bangladesh who said he and his group were paying around 9,000 euros each to
[03:53:06.480 --> 03:53:09.000]  make the journey said they're trying to get to West Europe not because they're
[03:53:09.000 --> 03:53:13.880]  fleeing war but because quote we love the European lifestyle so when you've
[03:53:13.880 --> 03:53:20.040]  got actual refugees who are actually fleeing war and persecution actually
[03:53:20.040 --> 03:53:23.840]  fleeing potential death by remaining in their home countries they're being
[03:53:23.840 --> 03:53:28.200]  displaced by the people who on by the people who admittedly in their own
[03:53:28.200 --> 03:53:33.400]  words are going there to make money for the lifestyle so the actual refugees
[03:53:33.400 --> 03:53:37.200]  are being put by the wayside they can't afford to pay the criminal people
[03:53:37.200 --> 03:53:41.400]  smugglers who are conspiring with the NGOs to get them into these countries so
[03:53:41.400 --> 03:53:45.720]  the actual refugees the people who actually need help like the Pakistani
[03:53:45.720 --> 03:53:50.040]  woman who recently was denied asylum in Britain they're being left behind
[03:53:50.040 --> 03:53:54.840]  because of these leftists and these NGOs with their bleeding heart crap as they
[03:53:54.840 --> 03:53:58.880]  presented whereas behind the scenes they're working with criminal people
[03:53:58.880 --> 03:54:02.920]  smugglers to get these people into these Western European countries who on
[03:54:02.920 --> 03:54:09.600]  refugees absolutely incredible the children who actually need asylum they're
[03:54:09.600 --> 03:54:12.880]  being caught off they're being put to the wayside because you have a bunch of
[03:54:12.880 --> 03:54:17.600]  lying 30 year olds with full beards being allowed into the country and as we
[03:54:17.600 --> 03:54:22.760]  saw earlier with this new footage out of Lauren Southern and her organization
[03:54:22.760 --> 03:54:27.600]  where advocates abroad they admit they teach migrants to lie to get into
[03:54:27.600 --> 03:54:33.040]  Western European countries because they're not refugees so these NGOs are
[03:54:33.040 --> 03:54:37.800]  actually harming real refugees there's also a brain drain of people out of
[03:54:37.800 --> 03:54:41.760]  those countries the ones who can afford to pay peace people smugglers leaving
[03:54:41.760 --> 03:54:44.960]  those countries in the Middle East predominantly so there's a brain drain
[03:54:44.960 --> 03:54:50.480]  and they're leaving the actual refugees behind absolutely incredible that they
[03:54:50.480 --> 03:54:55.800]  present themselves as these bleeding heart liberal liberals they point out
[03:54:55.800 --> 03:55:00.360]  us and call us racist and heartless when if we followed our advice they would
[03:55:00.360 --> 03:55:05.720]  actually treat and provide asylum for real refugees to a far greater degree
[03:55:05.720 --> 03:55:09.800]  it's absolutely unconscionable what's happening and it only seems to be getting
[03:55:09.800 --> 03:55:14.800]  worse in terms of these NGOs being paid to criminally smuggle people into Western
[03:55:14.800 --> 03:55:20.720]  Europe who don't deserve it who aren't fleeing war and who are not real refugees
[03:55:20.720 --> 03:55:24.880]  we've been talking about it for three years and it's still going on maybe it
[03:55:24.880 --> 03:55:28.360]  will take more of these organizations to be exposed where they'll have to
[03:55:28.360 --> 03:55:32.560]  basically just run off the internet and tile is happen in this case for this to
[03:55:32.560 --> 03:55:36.600]  get better and for serious questions to be asked it's absolutely ludicrous the
[03:55:36.600 --> 03:55:42.000]  situation final story though this went up on enforce.com about an hour ago
[03:55:42.000 --> 03:55:47.280]  Professor Warn's Amazon Echo is always recording your conversations now this is
[03:55:47.280 --> 03:55:51.360]  Nick Flor an associate professor of information systems out of New Mexico
[03:55:51.360 --> 03:55:56.880]  he was reacting to a story out of New Hampshire where basically a man is
[03:55:56.880 --> 03:56:02.640]  accused of a double murder stabbing two women to death in his home the judge in
[03:56:02.640 --> 03:56:06.800]  this case gave New Hampshire authorities permission to examine audio
[03:56:06.800 --> 03:56:13.360]  recordings from Echo which of course uses Amazon's Alexa voice assistant to
[03:56:13.360 --> 03:56:16.640]  try and find out if there's any information as to what happened during
[03:56:16.640 --> 03:56:22.120]  this double murder now the problem is as anyone will know to access that
[03:56:22.120 --> 03:56:27.160]  recording system where Alexa or Echo responds to a command from the user you
[03:56:27.160 --> 03:56:32.000]  have to give them the cue of saying Alexa why would a guy who is murdering
[03:56:32.000 --> 03:56:37.400]  two women in his home activate Alexa before he proceeds to commit the murder
[03:56:37.400 --> 03:56:43.760]  unless Alexa is recording the conversations in real time so Professor
[03:56:43.760 --> 03:56:47.560]  Nick Flor tweeted quote remember when Amazon claimed they only start recording
[03:56:47.560 --> 03:56:52.520]  when you said Alexa turns out that's a big freaking lie these stupid devices are
[03:56:52.520 --> 03:56:57.560]  always recording all it takes is one SJW working in Amazon support to leak all
[03:56:57.560 --> 03:57:03.480]  your conversations for the greater good so he makes the point they're not just
[03:57:03.480 --> 03:57:07.880]  recording when you give them the cue by saying Alexa tell me what the weather is
[03:57:07.880 --> 03:57:13.360]  today they must be recording all the time if these judges if these authorities
[03:57:13.360 --> 03:57:19.200]  are asking permission to access the audio files because why would he access
[03:57:19.200 --> 03:57:24.240]  Alexa why would he cue Amazon Echo before a double murder it makes no sense
[03:57:24.240 --> 03:57:28.440]  whatsoever so now a top professor is calling that out for what it is
[03:57:28.440 --> 03:57:32.440]  absolutely incredible story upon info wars.com I was gonna wrap it up for the
