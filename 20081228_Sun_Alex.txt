[00:22.680 --> 00:24.680]  IRA USA Radio News.
[00:24.680 --> 00:26.680]  I'm Jody Jordan.
[00:26.680 --> 00:28.680]  Israel has no plans to occupy Gaza.
[00:28.680 --> 00:31.680]  That word from the country's foreign minister, Tish B. Libby.
[00:31.680 --> 00:35.680]  She tells NBC's Meet the Press that the Israeli air assaults in Gaza
[00:35.680 --> 00:38.680]  came because the Hamas rulers there were smuggling weapons
[00:38.680 --> 00:40.680]  and building a small army.
[00:40.680 --> 00:42.680]  Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed
[00:42.680 --> 00:45.680]  and the Israeli action has brought protests.
[00:45.680 --> 00:47.680]  Israel has no plans to occupy Gaza.
[00:47.680 --> 00:49.680]  Israel has no plans to occupy Gaza.
[00:49.680 --> 00:53.680]  Israel has been killed and the Israeli action has brought protests.
[00:53.680 --> 00:57.680]  Secretary General of the Arab League, Hamer Musa, says he condemns the attacks.
[00:57.680 --> 01:03.680]  The main message is to stop all the violent actions
[01:03.680 --> 01:08.680]  and to stop the aggression against the Palestinians in Gaza.
[01:08.680 --> 01:10.680]  And Mark Levy has more.
[01:10.680 --> 01:12.680]  The death toll in Gaza keeps rising
[01:12.680 --> 01:14.680]  and there's no sign this is anywhere near its conclusion.
[01:14.680 --> 01:16.680]  Israel's air force is still pounding targets.
[01:16.680 --> 01:19.680]  There are signs Israel's preparing a ground invasion as well.
[01:19.680 --> 01:23.680]  It's the bloodiest offensive in Gaza since the 1967 Mideast War.
[01:23.680 --> 01:47.680]  This is IRN USA Radio News.

[02:26.680 --> 02:30.680]  The U.S. military says 14 Afghan school children are among the dead.
[02:30.680 --> 02:33.680]  After a suicide bomb attack in eastern Afghanistan,
[02:33.680 --> 02:37.680]  officials say the bomber tried to attack a meeting of tribal elders
[02:37.680 --> 02:41.680]  and instead set off the explosives near a primary school.
[02:41.680 --> 02:44.680]  In all, the military says 16 people died.
[02:44.680 --> 02:46.680]  Even amid the slowing economy,
[02:46.680 --> 02:51.680]  the incoming Obama administration still plans to provide a middle class tax cut.
[02:51.680 --> 02:57.680]  Obama advisor David Alexrod tells NBC that it's important to get money in people's pockets.
[02:57.680 --> 03:02.680]  But he also says President Bush's tax cuts will still be allowed to expire.
[03:02.680 --> 03:05.680]  Saying those tax cuts are geared to the wealthy.
[03:05.680 --> 03:09.680]  Larbush doesn't see her husband's eight years in office as a failure.
[03:09.680 --> 03:13.680]  She tells Fox News she disagrees with the critics who view it that way.
[03:13.680 --> 03:17.680]  But that she doesn't feel as if she needs to respond to them.
[03:17.680 --> 03:20.680]  She says history will judge her husband's presidency.
[03:20.680 --> 03:25.680]  For more news and analysis, log on to IRNnews.com.
[03:51.680 --> 03:58.680]  And more on the Middle East.
[03:58.680 --> 04:02.680]  Republican Senator Bob Corkers says he's very saddened
[04:02.680 --> 04:05.680]  that lives have been lost in the Middle East conflict.
[04:05.680 --> 04:08.680]  All of us, our hearts and prayers go out to people on both sides
[04:08.680 --> 04:13.680]  and certainly especially the civilians who've been harmed in the Gaza area.
[04:13.680 --> 04:17.680]  Several thousand people gathered for a pro-Palestinian demonstration today in Iraq.
[04:17.680 --> 04:19.680]  Here's Jim Hintz.
[04:19.680 --> 04:26.680]  There's a protest on Sunday of about 1,300 people in Mosul, one of Iraq's most violent cities.
[04:26.680 --> 04:30.680]  The protest was against Israel's airstrikes on Gaza.
[04:30.680 --> 04:33.680]  The forecast calls for clear skies today in the Midwest.
[04:33.680 --> 04:36.680]  A day after some summer-like weather, a week into winter.
[04:36.680 --> 04:40.680]  The region was pounded with hell, high winds and even funnel clouds.
[04:40.680 --> 04:44.680]  Much of Illinois, Missouri and Michigan are under a flood watch.
[04:44.680 --> 04:47.680]  Bruce Sullivan is a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
[04:47.680 --> 04:50.680]  We do have a system pushing into the Pacific Northwest.
[04:50.680 --> 04:54.680]  We have some heavy rain supports in northern California and Oregon
[04:54.680 --> 04:56.680]  where possible flooding conditions could develop.
[04:56.680 --> 05:00.680]  And further inland, that precipitation will be in the form of some heavy snow,
[05:00.680 --> 05:03.680]  especially in the mountains of northern Idaho, western Montana.
[05:03.680 --> 05:09.680]  What a transition into Let It Rain by Eric Clapton.
[05:09.680 --> 05:15.680]  Delaney Bramlett, the singer's songwriter, producer and pinned classic rock songs such as Let It Rain
[05:15.680 --> 05:20.680]  and worked with musicians like George Harrison and Eric Clapton died Saturday.
[05:20.680 --> 05:22.680]  He was 69.
[05:22.680 --> 05:48.680]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRNUSA Radio News.
[05:48.680 --> 05:54.680]  Only $12. Israeli gas masks, $20. Trigger finger gloves, $5 a pair or $36 a dozen.
[05:54.680 --> 05:59.680]  Snowshoe binding for $8 or $48 a dozen and so much more.
[05:59.680 --> 06:03.680]  Even hard to find surplus items all at surplus prices.

[07:05.680 --> 07:07.680]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:07.680 --> 07:12.680]  Welcome and thank you for joining us on this Sunday edition on here six days a week.
[07:12.680 --> 07:16.680]  Sunday's 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[07:16.680 --> 07:20.680]  Thank you for joining us whether you're listening on the M&FM dial, the internet at infowars.com
[07:20.680 --> 07:23.680]  or the podcast or global shortwave or satellite.
[07:23.680 --> 07:31.680]  Thank you again for joining us on this Sunday edition, the 28th day of December 2008.
[07:31.680 --> 07:36.680]  This is the I guess the last Sunday show for 2008.
[07:36.680 --> 07:38.680]  So this is the final one.
[07:38.680 --> 07:41.680]  I know everybody's saying it, but it's true.
[07:41.680 --> 07:44.680]  Time just speeds up faster and faster.
[07:44.680 --> 07:48.680]  It's not just that we're all getting older, but it's our way of lives.
[07:48.680 --> 07:53.680]  And there's so much to tell, so many things to keep track of in our modern lives
[07:53.680 --> 07:56.680]  that time seems to get away from us.
[07:56.680 --> 08:00.680]  But here we are live on this Sunday edition.
[08:00.680 --> 08:02.680]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[08:02.680 --> 08:13.680]  The websites are prisonplanet.com, infowars.net, jonesreport.com, truthnews.us, as well as infowars.com.
[08:13.680 --> 08:14.680]  A lot happening.
[08:14.680 --> 08:19.680]  Israel, as you know, starting yesterday, launched huge attacks into the Gaza Strip
[08:19.680 --> 08:27.680]  in response to years of Katusha rockets being fired into their territory.
[08:27.680 --> 08:34.680]  And militarily, it's the equivalent of a Daisy Red Rider BB gun.
[08:34.680 --> 08:41.680]  But if you are the few people killed each month from them, it is no joke.
[08:41.680 --> 08:47.680]  Well, Israel has responded by bombing large civilian populations
[08:47.680 --> 08:52.680]  and injuring now the reporting more than 700 people and more than 300 dead.
[08:52.680 --> 09:01.680]  And Israel is moving large amounts of troops and tanks and other artillery up to the border with the Gaza Strip.
[09:01.680 --> 09:05.680]  IDF mobilizes tanks, reinforces troops along Gaza border.
[09:05.680 --> 09:11.680]  Israeli Defense Forces on early Sunday began mobilizing tanks and reinforcing ground troops
[09:11.680 --> 09:15.680]  near the Gaza border in preparation for a possible ground incursion.
[09:15.680 --> 09:21.680]  Defense Minister Ehud Barak told Sky News that he would not rule out widening the offensive in Gaza Strip
[09:21.680 --> 09:24.680]  to include a ground invasion.
[09:24.680 --> 09:29.680]  I wonder if that will go better than the 2006 invasion of Lebanon.
[09:29.680 --> 09:33.680]  There they were fighting the Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
[09:33.680 --> 09:45.680]  Israel founded, according to Harat's in the 1970s, the group that they are now fighting as a counterbalance to Hezbollah.
[09:45.680 --> 09:56.680]  That's right, the group that Israel is fighting today in the Gaza Strip is the very group that Israel founded in the 70s
[09:56.680 --> 10:00.680]  as a counterbalance to Hezbollah.
[10:00.680 --> 10:04.680]  Very, very interesting.
[10:04.680 --> 10:07.680]  That, of course, is Hamas.
[10:07.680 --> 10:12.680]  So we'll be covering some of that today.
[10:12.680 --> 10:20.680]  Also over the weekend, masses of Indian and Pakistani troops built up along their borders.
[10:20.680 --> 10:28.680]  Last time we saw this was when war flared up between the two nuclear powers in 2002.
[10:28.680 --> 10:33.680]  But now both sides are saying, don't worry, this is not an escalation, though it clearly is.
[10:33.680 --> 10:42.680]  Shribs moving near the Indian border, action after Mumbai attacks, shifts focus from Afghanistan,
[10:42.680 --> 10:49.680]  which is exactly what the RAN Corporation says they want, is a theater war in that area.
[10:49.680 --> 10:53.680]  So that's some of the news there as well.
[10:53.680 --> 11:00.680]  Israel says they're set for a prolonged Gaza operation that may last weeks or even months
[11:00.680 --> 11:07.680]  and hundreds of Saudis being flown a day by fighter bombers.
[11:07.680 --> 11:12.680]  And the images are grisly, whole crowds blown to bits.
[11:12.680 --> 11:18.680]  Most of the main attacks have been focused on the government of the Gaza Strip itself,
[11:18.680 --> 11:28.680]  on police stations, on military installations, on a group of graduating police who are all out in formation
[11:28.680 --> 11:31.680]  in the yard of the police training center.
[11:31.680 --> 11:33.680]  Most of them were killed.
[11:33.680 --> 11:44.680]  So this is an attempt to decapitation of the Hamas government, which again was created by Israel.
[11:44.680 --> 11:48.680]  Before you roll your eyes about that, that's admitted in the Israeli newspapers,
[11:48.680 --> 11:50.680]  that that's how this works.
[11:50.680 --> 11:54.680]  And it's been declassified that when Israel doesn't want a peace deal to go forward,
[11:54.680 --> 11:58.680]  they'll basically fund terror groups that are attacking Israel.
[11:58.680 --> 12:03.680]  So see, it's not as simple as are you for the Palestinians, are you for Israel?
[12:03.680 --> 12:09.680]  The military industrial complex of Israel wants to keep conflict going in the area
[12:09.680 --> 12:14.680]  so they can crack down on the press, steal billions and billions of dollars a year
[12:14.680 --> 12:20.680]  from Israeli taxpayers to go into the black hole of their military system.
[12:20.680 --> 12:25.680]  A lot of the Arab countries also block off Palestinian areas
[12:25.680 --> 12:32.680]  so Palestinians can't emigrate or get out of different areas of the occupied territories
[12:32.680 --> 12:37.680]  to again, as a political football, continue this on forever.
[12:37.680 --> 12:41.680]  It's the same policy that we see from all wicked governments.
[12:41.680 --> 12:44.680]  So it's not a black or white issue.
[12:44.680 --> 12:54.680]  It is a great game or geopolitical chessboard that we are looking at here as a society.
[12:54.680 --> 13:00.680]  So that is some of the news that we have there as well.
[13:00.680 --> 13:04.680]  I've spent a lot of time on this, but I want to spend some more time on it today
[13:04.680 --> 13:12.680]  because the general public is just now finally becoming aware of it.
[13:12.680 --> 13:19.680]  The military, the Marines and the Army have openly announced now that they will engage
[13:19.680 --> 13:24.680]  the American people of order to do so and that regular Army and Marines will be stationed
[13:24.680 --> 13:31.680]  in every town and city to suppress and dominate the American people.
[13:31.680 --> 13:36.680]  Now, this has been in hundreds of newspapers the last few months,
[13:36.680 --> 13:41.680]  and one of the reports that I have here in front of me is out of the New York Post,
[13:41.680 --> 13:46.680]  another one out of CBS News, just last week.
[13:46.680 --> 13:51.680]  So when we come back, I'm going to take some phone calls on whatever issue you wish to discuss,
[13:51.680 --> 13:57.680]  the economy, the militarization of police, this whole globalist system,
[13:57.680 --> 14:01.680]  the fact that Congress is about to reauthorize NAFTA and GATT,
[14:01.680 --> 14:07.680]  despite the fact that in polls over 95% of Americans bipartisan don't want it,
[14:07.680 --> 14:11.680]  again, showing how illegitimate criminal government is,
[14:11.680 --> 14:15.680]  but I want to get into these reports where the press is announcing,
[14:15.680 --> 14:22.680]  but telling you it's a good idea that the Army and Marines be used against the American people.
[14:22.680 --> 14:29.680]  Now, remember, I told you they were gearing up for this for more than 12 years.
[14:29.680 --> 14:35.680]  The government documents, the on the ground intelligence going out and filming their drills,
[14:35.680 --> 14:38.680]  didn't take a rocket scientist when I would videotape Army and Marines,
[14:38.680 --> 14:43.680]  openly admitting their training to take over U.S. cities and confiscate our guns.
[14:43.680 --> 14:49.680]  It didn't take a rocket scientist to come on the air and warn you and shoot video of it and make films,
[14:49.680 --> 14:53.680]  and still large portions of the population would say,
[14:53.680 --> 14:56.680]  well, so what if the Army is training to fight the American people?
[14:56.680 --> 15:03.680]  That's good. It doesn't matter if that's tyranny and anti-American and classical corruption.
[15:03.680 --> 15:06.680]  But others would say, oh, no, it's not real. It's not happening.
[15:06.680 --> 15:11.680]  Well, now that it's openly being announced because they're preparing to actually do it now,
[15:11.680 --> 15:18.680]  this long-term plan coming to a head, people are now just spinning it.
[15:18.680 --> 15:23.680]  Well, you know, it's probably not going to happen, or even if it does, it's for our own good.
[15:23.680 --> 15:28.680]  Well, let me go over the latest developments on this front and then explain to you
[15:28.680 --> 15:32.680]  that this is not for your own good.
[15:32.680 --> 15:35.680]  See, when you hear the term New World Order, it's very simple.
[15:35.680 --> 15:43.680]  It's a group of offshore banking families who are setting up a world government.
[15:43.680 --> 15:50.680]  They come in and lobby governments to sign treaties with the private world government.
[15:50.680 --> 15:55.680]  And then that way, the private banks can literally become government and tax you
[15:55.680 --> 16:00.680]  and regulate you and control your life, and then they can steal tens of trillions of dollars
[16:00.680 --> 16:03.680]  out of your pension funds, your 401k.
[16:03.680 --> 16:08.680]  And then if you try to politically take back control of your nation and ever bring these criminals to justice,
[16:08.680 --> 16:15.680]  you can't because a military form of government has replaced the constitutional form.
[16:15.680 --> 16:19.680]  Now, now, this is stated. You're being robbed.
[16:19.680 --> 16:24.680]  Okay? Just like a third-world nation. It's not cute. It's not funny.
[16:24.680 --> 16:27.680]  We're going to cover the latest developments when we get back.
[16:27.680 --> 16:32.680]  Hi, John Humner from Mitus Resources. Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[16:32.680 --> 16:38.680]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week,
[16:38.680 --> 16:41.680]  are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[16:41.680 --> 16:45.680]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[16:45.680 --> 16:49.680]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.

[17:00.680 --> 17:04.680]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[17:04.680 --> 17:10.680]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.

[18:30.680 --> 18:33.680]  What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[18:33.680 --> 18:37.680]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[18:37.680 --> 18:43.680]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.

[20:27.680 --> 20:37.680]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[20:37.680 --> 20:45.680]  Alright folks, we are back live in the toll free number to join us on this 28th of December.
[20:45.680 --> 21:00.680]  In the waiting days and hours of 2008, 877-590-5525, 877-590-5525.
[21:00.680 --> 21:07.680]  And your calls from California, Arizona, Florida, Virginia and many other places are coming up in the next segment.
[21:07.680 --> 21:10.680]  So we have a lot of cognitive dissonance going on.
[21:10.680 --> 21:13.680]  You ever heard of that term?
[21:13.680 --> 21:19.680]  You know, the public's been told that crazies believe there's a secret plan for the military to take over America.
[21:19.680 --> 21:24.680]  It didn't matter if those crazies had congressional reports and declassified government documents.
[21:24.680 --> 21:29.680]  It didn't matter if they went out and videotaped urban warfare drills.
[21:29.680 --> 21:37.680]  The establishment, while they were busy setting this all up in its embryonic phase, it could have been shut down then.
[21:37.680 --> 21:41.680]  So they had to lie to you and say it didn't exist.
[21:41.680 --> 21:45.680]  But now that they're getting ready to roll it out, they have to announce it.
[21:45.680 --> 21:52.680]  Now that they're finally at their go date or their zero hour, their D-day.
[21:52.680 --> 22:00.680]  You know, I've got a bunch of comments here from YouTube and other sites I happen to see myself being attacked on.
[22:00.680 --> 22:03.680]  Also infowars.com in the comment section.
[22:03.680 --> 22:11.680]  With people still on there saying, oh, this Alex Jones is a nut, he's making this thing up about troops on the streets of America.
[22:11.680 --> 22:15.680]  It doesn't matter if they're commenting on a story.
[22:15.680 --> 22:17.680]  We're right above it.
[22:17.680 --> 22:27.680]  I have a link to the Phoenix Business Journal or CBS News or Associated Press or Army.mil.
[22:27.680 --> 22:30.680]  They just say, I'm a liar.
[22:30.680 --> 22:33.680]  And that's how cognitive dissonance works.
[22:33.680 --> 22:36.680]  Instead of ever getting around to, okay, do we want troops on the streets?
[22:36.680 --> 22:38.680]  Why is this happening?
[22:38.680 --> 22:41.680]  We'll just have a debate while they're on the streets.
[22:41.680 --> 22:45.680]  I guess confiscating our guns about whether or not they exist or not.
[22:45.680 --> 22:52.680]  I remember when in New Orleans, the police chief came out and said everybody will be disarmed.
[22:52.680 --> 22:54.680]  No one will be allowed to be armed.
[22:54.680 --> 22:57.680]  And they went door to door in the high end drive and wealthy areas.
[22:57.680 --> 23:03.680]  He was in people's houses, didn't bring food and water and took people's guns and took them to jail.
[23:03.680 --> 23:07.680]  And I played the clip on air and I even read the New York Times admitting gun confiscation.
[23:07.680 --> 23:16.680]  And I had people calling me and I had people emailing me saying I was a fear mongering liar.
[23:16.680 --> 23:22.680]  You know, Governor Blagojevic is in trouble now, but what, two months ago, two and a half months ago,
[23:22.680 --> 23:29.680]  I did an audio clip of him at a press conference where he said we're using the National Guard for gun confiscation
[23:29.680 --> 23:31.680]  in the cities where they have total gun bans.
[23:31.680 --> 23:36.680]  And they send the army out with the police in black scheme asking uniforms.
[23:36.680 --> 23:42.680]  It's on the news and they confiscate guns.
[23:42.680 --> 23:45.680]  And nobody wants to touch that, the NRA, nobody.
[23:45.680 --> 23:47.680]  See, that's too real.
[23:47.680 --> 23:49.680]  It's going on now.
[23:49.680 --> 23:54.680]  You know, we've been inside the North American Union under NAFTA and GATT since 1994.
[23:54.680 --> 23:57.680]  It's in the treaty.
[23:57.680 --> 23:58.680]  It's been expanded.
[23:58.680 --> 24:00.680]  We're now part of the European Union.
[24:00.680 --> 24:03.680]  That transatlantic deal was signed last year.
[24:03.680 --> 24:09.680]  I have Bush signing it, announcing it, in the Rose Garden, in my film end game.
[24:09.680 --> 24:11.680]  Doesn't matter, doesn't exist.
[24:11.680 --> 24:17.680]  You know, I've got Texas employees and earlier this year in January I got my new sheet
[24:17.680 --> 24:22.680]  saying from the Texas Workforce Commission saying here you are for the North American worker ID,
[24:22.680 --> 24:25.680]  part of the North American integration.
[24:25.680 --> 24:29.680]  I mean, I mean, I even get North American documents in the mail.
[24:29.680 --> 24:32.680]  Doesn't exist.
[24:32.680 --> 24:34.680]  Doesn't exist.
[24:34.680 --> 24:36.680]  So let me tell you something.
[24:36.680 --> 24:43.680]  You may think it's smiley and cute and funny to live in denial about all this and to giggle and smirk about serious issues.
[24:43.680 --> 24:48.680]  But tyranny can happen here and tyranny is happening here.
[24:48.680 --> 24:58.680]  And you're sitting around sitting on your thumb, you know, or you got your thumb in your mouth,
[24:58.680 --> 25:05.680]  sucking on it like a little baby giggling and smirking and, you know, looking at the government like it's your mommy.
[25:05.680 --> 25:07.680]  It's not your mommy.
[25:07.680 --> 25:10.680]  It's a private receivership group for offshore banks.
[25:10.680 --> 25:17.680]  And they're going to take everything you've got and they're training the military to gun you down on the streets.
[25:17.680 --> 25:18.680]  Okay.
[25:18.680 --> 25:21.680]  And the military is full of foreigners and aggravated felons now,
[25:21.680 --> 25:27.680]  not to mention that they're openly announcing in public treaties to use foreign troops in the U.S.
[25:27.680 --> 25:36.680]  That's now mainstream news and the public can't deal with it.
[25:36.680 --> 25:41.680]  Now, here is the New York Post. This was a New York Post on Tuesday.
[25:41.680 --> 25:45.680]  U.S. Army ready if the downturn gets out of hand.
[25:45.680 --> 25:50.680]  And the article goes on to talk about how great it is by John Crudel.
[25:50.680 --> 25:54.680]  And they act like the Army just now started this.
[25:54.680 --> 25:58.680]  Just now they decided to put 20,000 troops on the streets of America.
[25:58.680 --> 26:00.680]  No, they've been planning this for decades.
[26:00.680 --> 26:08.680]  Slowly twisting the military, the officers and the troops to go along with this takeover.
[26:08.680 --> 26:16.680]  Kind of like an Operation Valkyrie in reverse.
[26:16.680 --> 26:19.680]  And it goes on here.
[26:19.680 --> 26:21.680]  So, see, you always wondered how they'd propose it.
[26:21.680 --> 26:27.680]  Well, I always told you they'd stage terror attacks first to train the police and military to accept it internally.
[26:27.680 --> 26:32.680]  Then they'd have a controlled economic collapse to finally bring them out on the streets.
[26:32.680 --> 26:37.680]  I mean, I made a film seven years ago where we lay that out.
[26:37.680 --> 26:42.680]  Several of my films break that down.
[26:42.680 --> 26:45.680]  So, it goes on.
[26:45.680 --> 26:51.680]  Are you afraid that the economic downturn could get out of hand?
[26:51.680 --> 26:52.680]  I mean, really out of hand?
[26:52.680 --> 27:06.680]  Well, don't worry, the U.S. Army War College is on the case ready to handle unforeseen economic collapse and the rapid dislocation of public order in all or significant parts of the U.S.
[27:06.680 --> 27:09.680]  And you thought we were only dealing with a recession.
[27:09.680 --> 27:25.680]  In the report published on November 4th, just in time of the holiday season, the War College Strategic Studies Institute post-stated on a number of shocks that the country should be prepared for, including unrest caused by the economy's failure.
[27:25.680 --> 27:31.680]  Yeah, if you actually read that report, we've written articles about in the last few months before it was in the New York Post.
[27:31.680 --> 27:36.680]  It's all about how they're prepared to engage the American people.
[27:36.680 --> 27:42.680]  And it's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act from two years ago that the governors are no longer governors.
[27:42.680 --> 27:43.680]  They're puppets of the feds.
[27:43.680 --> 27:45.680]  And Congress has no authority.
[27:45.680 --> 27:48.680]  Everything is the presidency, which is a total dictatorship.
[27:48.680 --> 27:52.680]  And people are like, well, Bush didn't declare martial law.
[27:52.680 --> 27:53.680]  Thought he was.
[27:53.680 --> 27:55.680]  No, I said here on the show six months ago.
[27:55.680 --> 28:02.680]  I said, you're all thinking it's going to be George Bush and Naomi Wolfon who was hyperventilating thinking he was about to declare martial law.
[28:02.680 --> 28:08.680]  And I said, lady, they're going to pass all these powers on to Barack Obama.
[28:08.680 --> 28:11.680]  Because these guys are puppets for the offshore banks.
[28:11.680 --> 28:13.680]  Quit thinking the president runs anything.
[28:13.680 --> 28:19.680]  He's just as big a ceremonial jumping jack puppet as Congress is.
[28:19.680 --> 28:21.680]  Now, how do we get America back?
[28:21.680 --> 28:25.680]  We admit we're in these straights.
[28:25.680 --> 28:28.680]  But I know you're not going to listen until most of you are homeless.
[28:28.680 --> 28:30.680]  But then I want you to remember.
[28:30.680 --> 28:36.680]  Then I want you to wipe the, the, the Cheshire cat smile off your face.
[28:36.680 --> 28:39.680]  It's really another kind of smile, but wipe it off.
[28:39.680 --> 28:47.680]  Quit feeling so arrogant and know it all and powerful and admit you really don't know a lot and that I've been right about all this and that we're really going into tyranny.
[28:47.680 --> 28:49.680]  And then maybe we can turn this around.
[28:49.680 --> 28:52.680]  But until you grow up, I'm not talking to my regular listeners.
[28:52.680 --> 28:58.680]  I'm talking to, you know, Johnny come lately out there still snickering right now.
[28:58.680 --> 28:59.680]  So there's that article.
[28:59.680 --> 29:02.680]  Here's one out of the Phoenix business journal.
[29:02.680 --> 29:07.680]  Arizona police say they're prepared as war college warrants military must prep for unrest.
[29:07.680 --> 29:11.680]  IMF warrants of economic crisis, world depression.
[29:11.680 --> 29:13.680]  And I got a bunch of other stories there.
[29:13.680 --> 29:21.680]  Now I told you, you'd see a bunch of government propaganda about, oh, the army's just here to change your tire.
[29:21.680 --> 29:23.680]  Well, sure enough, they've, they're on the news.
[29:23.680 --> 29:24.680]  Get ready for that.
[29:24.680 --> 29:26.680]  And then your phone calls when we get back.
[29:26.680 --> 29:28.680]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[29:28.680 --> 29:30.680]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[29:30.680 --> 29:32.680]  I can't find my wallet.
[29:32.680 --> 29:33.680]  Sound familiar?
[29:33.680 --> 29:36.680]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?
[29:36.680 --> 29:42.680]  Introducing our patented find one, find all keyfinders or FOFA XD for short.
[29:42.680 --> 29:48.680]  Once a FOFA keyfinder is attached to each of those easy to lose things, it can find and be found by all the rest.

[31:26.680 --> 31:31.680]  Drinking Mate proudly presents another mind boggling episode of America's toughest quiz show.
[31:31.680 --> 31:33.680]  That's too complicated.
[31:33.680 --> 31:39.680]  Let's see if we can figure out which contestant got the intellectual edge after an evening of partying by using Drinking Mate.
[31:39.680 --> 31:41.680]  Four 20 points in the wind, Milt.
[31:41.680 --> 31:42.680]  Glur five and blank.
[31:42.680 --> 31:47.680]  Kynate receptor subunits and hippocampal neurons co-assemble to form functional receptors.
[31:47.680 --> 31:49.680]  Uh, uh, pony?
[31:49.680 --> 31:51.680]  Oh, too bad.
[31:51.680 --> 31:52.680]  Yes, Chip.
[31:52.680 --> 31:56.680]  The logical companion of Glur five, Glur six.
[31:56.680 --> 31:57.680]  You've won the game.
[31:57.680 --> 31:59.680]  Hey, life is like a game.
[31:59.680 --> 32:05.680]  And if you want to win, you've got to give it your best every day, which doesn't always happen after an evening of celebrating with friends and family.
[32:05.680 --> 32:11.680]  That's why there's Drinking Mate, a patented formula of guava leaf extract proven to reduce the effects of hangover.
[32:11.680 --> 32:16.680]  It restores balance to your body, keeping headaches and nausea at bay, and it really works.

[32:29.680 --> 32:36.680]  Whether you know it or not, red light and speed cameras are everywhere ready to snap a photo of your license plate.
[32:36.680 --> 32:43.680]  One simple, harmless error could end up costing you over $500 quickly putting an end to your holiday cheer.
[32:43.680 --> 32:45.680]  Fight back with Photo Blocker.
[32:45.680 --> 32:48.680]  Simply spray your plate once and you're done.
[32:48.680 --> 32:53.680]  Any photos of your license plate will appear overexposed, making them virtually unreadable.
[32:53.680 --> 32:57.680]  See the newscast showing just how Photo Blocker works against traffic cameras.
[32:57.680 --> 33:06.680]  Christmas is here and the economy is in bad enough shape without spending hundreds of dollars in fees that can be avoided with one simple application of Photo Blocker.
[33:06.680 --> 33:15.680]  Go to SprayYourPlate.com, that's SprayYourPlate.com or call 1-800-276-9601.
[33:15.680 --> 33:19.680]  That's 1-800-276-9601.
[33:19.680 --> 33:25.680]  Don't give your money to the state, spray your plate, and when the cameras flash, you'll save some cash.
[33:28.680 --> 33:30.680]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[34:00.680 --> 34:05.680]  They'll eat their guts, your guts, your momma's guts, and ask for seconds.
[34:05.680 --> 34:09.680]  You think it's cute, letting tyranny grow? You think it's fun?
[34:09.680 --> 34:18.680]  Well, you're going to find out what it's like to get butchered like a fat Christmas hog because you're on the highway to hell.
[34:18.680 --> 34:20.680]  Yeah!
[34:20.680 --> 34:26.680]  Party time!
[34:26.680 --> 34:35.680]  You're on the highway to the New World Order.
[34:35.680 --> 34:42.680]  You're not going to stop, keep watching the football games, keep acting like a know-it-all yuppie, a dumb liberal, a dumb mainline conservative.
[34:42.680 --> 34:44.680]  Go ahead and tell me Obama's going to save us.
[34:44.680 --> 34:47.680]  Yeah! No speed limit, baby!
[34:47.680 --> 34:57.680]  No stop, stop!
[34:57.680 --> 35:08.680]  Obama, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hattie, give me the pap, give me the lies, oh, give me control paradigm.
[35:08.680 --> 35:11.680]  Yeah, you're not a rocking band!
[35:11.680 --> 35:17.680]  How long, ladies and gentlemen, have we been talking about all the real issues that have come true?
[35:17.680 --> 35:25.680]  Now you hear these mainline talk show hosts acting like, oh, they've turned up the money printing presses, oh, the Federal Reserve, oh, the CFR.
[35:25.680 --> 35:34.680]  All these talk show hosts that attack Ron Paul, suddenly they like him because now there's not a danger of him actually becoming president and turning this around.
[35:34.680 --> 35:37.680]  Yeah, you're a day late and a dollar short, all of you.
[35:37.680 --> 35:42.680]  And you mainline Democrats all running around. Barack Obama has betrayed you on every front.
[35:42.680 --> 35:49.680]  There's going to be more wars, more regulations, more taxes on the middle class, a tax on the free Internet, a tax on free speech.
[35:49.680 --> 35:52.680]  On and on, more NAFTA, more GATT.
[35:52.680 --> 35:57.680]  He just appointed his head of trade who openly is called for a North American Union.
[35:57.680 --> 36:05.680]  When he said he'd get rid of NAFTA and GATT, he betrayed you like all these New World Order slimeballs did.
[36:05.680 --> 36:19.680]  Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama, take me.
[36:19.680 --> 36:28.680]  Who I am, the governor, oh, I love the mainstream media. I love the Enlightened.
[36:28.680 --> 36:33.160]  And no, the troops come to take you to the FEMA camp.
[36:33.160 --> 36:34.160]  You'll just thank them.
[36:34.160 --> 36:35.160]  Oh, thank you.
[36:35.160 --> 36:36.160]  Thank you.
[36:36.160 --> 36:37.160]  Oh, yes.
[36:37.160 --> 36:38.160]  I'm patriotic.
[36:38.160 --> 36:39.160]  All right.
[36:39.160 --> 36:48.000]  Let's get serious because I want to go to your calls at 877-590-5525.
[36:48.000 --> 36:51.080]  You know, it's admitted a year and a half after we broke the story with the secret
[36:51.080 --> 36:52.760]  FEMA documents here on air.
[36:52.760 --> 36:58.360]  They've hired 26,000 preachers covertly through FEMA to tell their flocks to hand their guns
[36:58.360 --> 37:00.280]  in and go to FEMA camps.
[37:00.280 --> 37:05.520]  You think FEMA's covertly hiring 26,000 preachers because they want to play patty cake with
[37:05.520 --> 37:06.520]  you?
[37:06.520 --> 37:09.800]  No, they knew a long time ago their banker masters were going to steal everything you
[37:09.800 --> 37:15.120]  had, your police and fire department and teacher pension funds.
[37:15.120 --> 37:19.560]  And now they've got an army made up of illegal aliens and felons who will enforce all the
[37:19.560 --> 37:20.560]  theft.
[37:20.560 --> 37:26.000]  And if you don't grow up and say no to this, they're going to go along with the next phase.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.680]  They're testing you right now.
[37:28.680 --> 37:30.800]  Now go back a couple of months ago.
[37:30.800 --> 37:32.120]  What did I say you'd see?
[37:32.120 --> 37:36.480]  I said you'd hear about the army on the streets of America.
[37:36.480 --> 37:42.320]  Now they openly admit it's to suppress you during rioting and collapse of society.
[37:42.320 --> 37:43.320]  That's in the documents.
[37:43.320 --> 37:47.360]  But when they publicly announce it to the cattle, they tell you, oh, the army's going
[37:47.360 --> 37:51.520]  to be helping change tires and get people out of car wrecks.
[37:51.520 --> 37:53.960]  Remember, I told you that's what you'd hear.
[37:53.960 --> 37:54.960]  Remember?
[37:54.960 --> 37:55.960]  What did I know?
[37:55.960 --> 37:56.960]  I was reading the full report.
[37:56.960 --> 38:02.560]  They said they would do PR propaganda, and sure enough, here it is.
[38:02.560 --> 38:04.680]  It is now in the newspaper.
[38:04.680 --> 38:06.040]  This is out of the coastal courier.
[38:06.040 --> 38:09.120]  It's in scores of papers, similar propaganda.
[38:09.120 --> 38:14.920]  Specialist Dale Swanger from the 3rd Infantry Division, Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, Field
[38:14.920 --> 38:21.520]  Altillery, uses the jaws of life to extract someone from a car.
[38:21.520 --> 38:26.800]  Then it goes in to say, oh, well, the troops are just here to help at car wrecks, Mr. Jones.
[38:26.800 --> 38:31.160]  Okay, you said we'd have troops on the streets, but what, you're against them, live-flighting
[38:31.160 --> 38:32.160]  people?
[38:32.160 --> 38:33.680]  You're against them with the jaws of life?
[38:33.680 --> 38:38.480]  Well, see, you're being acclimated, just like a domesticated hog goes, well, I like
[38:38.480 --> 38:39.480]  my master.
[38:39.480 --> 38:41.880]  He brings me grain.
[38:41.880 --> 38:47.320]  You're being acclimated to live in the pen before you go to the slaughterhouse.
[38:47.320 --> 38:51.000]  You're like a horse that loves its master when he puts you in the trailer to take you
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.920]  to the glue factory.
[38:52.920 --> 38:54.680]  And the troops, this is to acclimate them too.
[38:54.680 --> 38:58.840]  Oh, yeah, you're going to be on the streets of America now, helping at car wrecks.
[38:58.840 --> 39:02.080]  The troops are like, well, I guess that's all right.
[39:02.080 --> 39:07.400]  The cops are like, yeah, yeah, they're here to help at car wrecks now.
[39:07.400 --> 39:10.600]  The Army's here all of a sudden.
[39:10.600 --> 39:16.680]  I heard that Alex on there saying it was tyranny, but I mean, it ain't tyranny to be helping
[39:16.680 --> 39:18.680]  at a car wreck or nothing.
[39:18.680 --> 39:23.840]  I mean, what do you get helping at wrecks for?
[39:23.840 --> 39:27.320]  See how they're manipulating your little minds?
[39:27.320 --> 39:32.400]  The troops, the police, the general public, all of us, I don't like Army Psyops being
[39:32.400 --> 39:33.400]  right on me.
[39:33.400 --> 39:35.640]  It gets me angry.
[39:35.640 --> 39:36.640]  You know why?
[39:36.640 --> 39:37.960]  Because I know what comes at the end of the tunnel.
[39:37.960 --> 39:40.080]  I know what comes at the end of this little ride.
[39:40.080 --> 39:43.480]  I know these people have been training to take our guns.
[39:43.480 --> 39:45.960]  I've got them on video.
[39:45.960 --> 39:49.880]  Ah, that's the problem, you idiots.
[39:49.880 --> 39:51.840]  Yes, they're coming for your guns.
[39:51.840 --> 39:55.840]  Yes, Obama is coming for your guns, and it didn't just start today.
[39:55.840 --> 39:58.200]  This establishment wants to domesticate you.
[39:58.200 --> 40:00.840]  They want you to be a dominated milk hog.
[40:00.840 --> 40:01.840]  They milk.
[40:01.840 --> 40:03.000]  The elite is cold-blooded.
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.280]  They don't care about you or your liberty or your freedom.
[40:05.280 --> 40:07.400]  They're not your friends.
[40:07.400 --> 40:13.680]  All the TV ads and PR and propaganda and shows like Homeland Security, USA, and all of it
[40:13.680 --> 40:18.880]  is to make the government, the moral authority, the heroes in our minds so we are sold on
[40:18.880 --> 40:23.920]  going along with their tyranny.
[40:23.920 --> 40:27.880]  You know, Homeland Security, USA is going to debut in a few days on ABC.
[40:27.880 --> 40:30.720]  I wouldn't watch the promos for it online.
[40:30.720 --> 40:31.720]  And you know what?
[40:31.720 --> 40:33.800]  They're doing what's legitimate, what's under the Constitution.
[40:33.800 --> 40:35.200]  See, they're slick.
[40:35.200 --> 40:36.440]  They're showing the Border Patrol.
[40:36.440 --> 40:37.440]  They're showing the Coast Guard.
[40:37.440 --> 40:40.400]  They're showing these great men and women.
[40:40.400 --> 40:46.760]  And then see, in the second season, you watch in a year or in six months, then it'll be
[40:46.760 --> 40:51.880]  the anti-gun teams on the streets in Homeland Security, USA, and the local spy groups.
[40:51.880 --> 40:57.840]  But see, they're going to sell you on the show first with the admirable Border Patrol,
[40:57.840 --> 40:59.400]  the admirable Coast Guard.
[40:59.400 --> 41:03.080]  So, see, people are like, well, what's wrong with it?
[41:03.080 --> 41:05.280]  What's wrong with Homeland Security, USA?
[41:05.280 --> 41:09.800]  Shows them protecting our border because the establishment knows you want our border protected.
[41:09.800 --> 41:12.240]  The fact is, they don't let the troops protect the border.
[41:12.240 --> 41:15.240]  And the troops are openly designed for the American people.
[41:15.240 --> 41:17.320]  And these giant deployments are for us.
[41:17.320 --> 41:22.080]  But to sell us on this image, they're going to show us Homeland Security, USA with troops,
[41:22.080 --> 41:24.120]  with the Border Patrol, and others.
[41:24.120 --> 41:27.400]  You see, in a legitimate role to then set the stage.
[41:27.400 --> 41:29.040]  See, that's the type of propaganda.
[41:29.040 --> 41:32.960]  That's there's thousands of different types, but that's just one that I'm pointing out
[41:32.960 --> 41:35.080]  here for you.
[41:35.080 --> 41:38.920]  Again, am I against the average troops?
[41:38.920 --> 41:40.520]  Am I against the average soldier?
[41:40.520 --> 41:41.520]  No.
[41:41.520 --> 41:42.520]  Am I against the average cop?
[41:42.520 --> 41:43.520]  No.
[41:43.520 --> 41:49.520]  I'm against the directives from on high, the mission statements, the rules of engagement
[41:49.520 --> 41:51.480]  you've been given.
[41:51.480 --> 41:56.760]  The Army War College admits, the Pentagon admits, they are preparing the U.S. military
[41:56.760 --> 41:58.800]  to engage the American people.
[41:58.800 --> 42:02.920]  And the private offshore bankers that own this country through fraud, it's fraudulent,
[42:02.920 --> 42:06.800]  are going to create a scenario where I might even beg for troops.
[42:06.800 --> 42:12.360]  That's right, because you're on a two-front war here.
[42:12.360 --> 42:17.200]  Within three to five days, Army Studies, going back to the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s show all over
[42:17.200 --> 42:23.920]  the world, within three to five days of limited food and water, almost everyone will steal.
[42:23.920 --> 42:30.360]  Within 10 to 15 days, 99% of people will kill for food.
[42:30.360 --> 42:37.800]  Now you take this decadent slob population, totally spoiled.
[42:37.800 --> 42:41.480]  They don't get food for a week or two, folks, they will turn in their guns, they will hand
[42:41.480 --> 42:45.160]  over their children, they will go to FEMA camps, they will take force inoculations,
[42:45.160 --> 42:46.160]  and then everything will be fixed.
[42:46.160 --> 42:49.760]  The government will back off, it'll set the precedent, hey, look, they got things fixed
[42:49.760 --> 42:52.160]  during the rioting.
[42:52.160 --> 42:58.560]  In 2010, hey, you know, Alex, you were right about the troops planning all this, but you
[42:58.560 --> 43:02.120]  know what, good thing they were there, and then the president said, troops are on the
[43:02.120 --> 43:08.160]  streets of America forever, and then the real tyranny can start.
[43:08.160 --> 43:12.680]  The next wave of staged terror to be blamed on the militias and the people of the United
[43:12.680 --> 43:13.680]  States.
[43:13.680 --> 43:19.120]  So, see, this is going to be gradual program of enslavement that we're going into.
[43:19.120 --> 43:24.160]  Your phone calls, the second we come out hot with our afterburners from this break, strap
[43:24.160 --> 43:26.880]  yourselves in, you found the front lines of the Info Wars.
[43:26.880 --> 43:30.600]  So, you've finally decided you're going to stock up and store food.
[43:30.600 --> 43:33.160]  But why settle for bland, tasteless food?
[43:33.160 --> 43:34.640]  Why settle for less?

[44:23.920 --> 44:27.280]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight?
[44:27.280 --> 44:31.160]  Only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not

[45:32.120 --> 45:33.120]  in the water.
[45:33.120 --> 45:36.920]  These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.

[47:38.000 --> 47:39.000]  So let's talk.
[47:39.000 --> 47:40.000]  Let's chat.
[47:40.000 --> 47:46.080]  Let's start a dialogue about your ideas and mine.
[47:46.080 --> 47:50.760]  Oh, Hillary Clinton saving us now?
[47:50.760 --> 47:54.280]  What are you doing playing Hillary Clinton in there, Paul?
[47:54.280 --> 48:01.880]  It goes Bush Clinton, Bush Clinton, I guess we'll always have a Clinton in the White House.
[48:01.880 --> 48:06.040]  I'm so sick of looking at that woman, but I'm already sick of Barack Obama, you know.
[48:06.040 --> 48:11.040]  A new face, yeah, but same old action and all the retreads he's brought into his administration.
[48:11.040 --> 48:19.160]  All right, Gary, Mark, Aaron, Igor, and others, I'm going to get to your calls here momentarily.
[48:19.160 --> 48:25.280]  Some of the other news that I have here in front of me deals with the economy, and we
[48:25.280 --> 48:26.640]  will be going over that.
[48:26.640 --> 48:31.720]  In case you didn't know, the banking crisis is orchestrated, and we go over all the evidence
[48:31.720 --> 48:36.520]  of that in stories at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and with guests here on air, and later
[48:36.520 --> 48:39.720]  in the next hour I'm going to break down some of the news developments there and the evidence
[48:39.720 --> 48:41.880]  that it is an inside job.
[48:41.880 --> 48:45.360]  But remember, we're the people that told you three years ago that we're going to orchestrate
[48:45.360 --> 48:50.720]  a subprime mortgage implosion by design and that it would lead to what you're now seeing.
[48:50.720 --> 48:54.680]  All the other pundits told you everything was fine and rosy and that we were never in
[48:54.680 --> 48:55.680]  a recession.
[48:55.680 --> 48:59.840]  So, just remember who's been right all along and who's been wrong.
[48:59.840 --> 49:05.480]  Just to put an end cap on this or bookends on it, as they say, with the whole Marshall
[49:05.480 --> 49:09.560]  Law situation, a lot of people think it's cute and funny because they think they're
[49:09.560 --> 49:13.640]  members of the establishment, but don't forget what the encyclopedia has to say about Smedley
[49:13.640 --> 49:14.640]  Butler.
[49:14.640 --> 49:21.080]  Smedley Darlington Butler, nicknamed the Fighting Quaker or Old Gimble Eye, was a major general
[49:21.080 --> 49:25.320]  in the U.S. Marine Corps and at one, at the time of his death, the most decorated Marine
[49:25.320 --> 49:27.160]  in U.S. history.
[49:27.160 --> 49:33.080]  During his 34 years of Marine Corps service, Butler was awarded numerous medals for heroism,
[49:33.080 --> 49:37.520]  including the Marine Corps' brevet medal, the highest Marine medal at the time for
[49:37.520 --> 49:43.960]  officers, and subsequently the Medal of Honor twice, notably he is only one of 19 people
[49:43.960 --> 49:49.920]  to be twice awarded the Medal of Honor, and one of only three to be awarded a Marine Corps
[49:49.920 --> 49:55.480]  brevet medal and a Medal of Honor, and the only person to be awarded a Marine Corps brevet
[49:55.480 --> 49:58.840]  medal and the Medal of Honor for two different actions.
[49:58.840 --> 50:04.440]  In addition to his military career, Smedley Butler, shot the chest, thigh, arm, a bunch
[50:04.440 --> 50:10.240]  of other stuff, while saving people, Smedley Butler was noted for his outspoken anti-interventionalist
[50:10.240 --> 50:16.360]  views, and his book, War as a Rocket, his book was one of the first works describing
[50:16.360 --> 50:20.320]  the workings of the military industrial complex, and after retiring from the service, he became
[50:20.320 --> 50:25.160]  a popular speaker at meetings organized by veterans, pacifists, and church-cribs in the
[50:25.160 --> 50:26.160]  1930s.
[50:26.160 --> 50:30.880]  In 34, he informed the United States Congress that a group of wealthy industrialists had
[50:30.880 --> 50:35.920]  plotted a military coup known as the business plot to overthrow the government of President
[50:35.920 --> 50:41.080]  Franklin, Delana Roosevelt, and that later they had the McCormick-Dickstein Committee
[50:41.080 --> 50:42.080]  hearings.
[50:42.080 --> 50:48.400]  Now, see, we had Marines and Army officers like that back in the 30s when Hitler's people
[50:48.400 --> 50:53.160]  threw George Bush, Sr.'s father, Prescott Bush, the head of the operation, oh, that's
[50:53.160 --> 50:59.400]  congressional testimony, next you'll tell me Congress doesn't exist, I understand, or
[50:59.400 --> 51:03.480]  the sun or moon doesn't exist, but the point is they tried to overthrow and they went to
[51:03.480 --> 51:09.480]  the Marine Corps to do it because he was next in line to be the commandant, and, you know,
[51:09.480 --> 51:12.960]  he had helped overthrow scores of nations for the private bankers.
[51:12.960 --> 51:18.520]  He'd never really spoken out politically, and so they thought that he was their man,
[51:18.520 --> 51:25.720]  and so they came to him and said, let's overthrow the government and basically link up with
[51:25.720 --> 51:30.840]  Hitler, and so he played along with them long enough to go to their secret meetings of some
[51:30.840 --> 51:34.760]  of the richest people in the U.S., basically people that run Wall Street today, I mean,
[51:34.760 --> 51:39.960]  it's all the big families, and then he blew the whistle to Congress, a few of them got
[51:39.960 --> 51:44.720]  arrested, but some of them were so powerful that the media basically covered it up in
[51:44.720 --> 51:48.880]  Congress, and even Roosevelt said, let's just drop this because this could bring down the
[51:48.880 --> 51:51.800]  government by itself, it's so horrible.
[51:51.800 --> 51:55.800]  So for those of you out there sucking your thumbs, rolling your eyes, giggling and smirking,
[51:55.800 --> 51:59.960]  you think Marshall Law's cute, now that it's admitted that we're basically under it, Congress
[51:59.960 --> 52:05.240]  was threatened with Marshall Law nine weeks ago when they passed the Banker Takeover Bill,
[52:05.240 --> 52:08.520]  now close to $10 trillion stolen.
[52:08.520 --> 52:12.720]  I sit close, $8.5 trillion as of two and a half weeks ago, that was the last number
[52:12.720 --> 52:18.560]  we had, seven weeks into the bailouts, I don't know what it is now, it's growing.
[52:18.560 --> 52:22.120]  All the offshore banks, no one can even see it, Congress can't see it, and when Congress
[52:22.120 --> 52:25.720]  says they want to see it, they're told, sit down and shut up.
[52:25.720 --> 52:28.840]  Now this is a coup by offshore banks through Wall Street.
[52:28.840 --> 52:31.360]  All right, I'm done talking about it.
[52:31.360 --> 52:37.360]  The point is, if we wouldn't have had Smedley Butler in 1934, this country wouldn't exist
[52:37.360 --> 52:40.880]  right now, and Hitler would have won.
[52:40.880 --> 52:43.240]  But we became Hitler, so what does it matter?
[52:43.240 --> 52:47.800]  I mean, this is so important.
[52:47.800 --> 52:49.360]  They have had their coup.
[52:49.360 --> 52:51.320]  They found generals that like it.
[52:51.320 --> 52:56.000]  Now they told Admiral Fox Fallon three months ago, four months ago, to stage terror attacks
[52:56.000 --> 53:01.560]  against U.S. ships, this has now come out in New Yorker Magazine and even MSNBC, claiming
[53:01.560 --> 53:04.080]  I branded it and he did resign.
[53:04.080 --> 53:07.760]  So I guess there are Smedley butlers out there.
[53:07.760 --> 53:15.560]  I mean, the head of the Allied forces in the Middle East refused.
[53:15.560 --> 53:16.560]  But doesn't matter.
[53:16.560 --> 53:21.760]  They just get rid of him and put some, you know, demon in there who will.
[53:21.760 --> 53:22.920]  God help us, man.
[53:22.920 --> 53:24.080]  God help us.
[53:24.080 --> 53:27.880]  And again, I know you think martial laws for your brown neighbor.
[53:27.880 --> 53:28.880]  It's not.
[53:28.880 --> 53:30.000]  It's for you.
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.520]  It's for anybody who's got a bank account.
[53:32.520 --> 53:34.120]  These are thieves.
[53:34.120 --> 53:35.160]  This is the New World Order.
[53:35.160 --> 53:36.160]  They want power.
[53:36.160 --> 53:38.280]  They want global domination.
[53:38.280 --> 53:39.680]  They hate the United States.
[53:39.680 --> 53:42.680]  They just use false patriotism to sell us on this.
[53:42.680 --> 53:45.120]  Gary in California, thank you for holding.
[53:45.120 --> 53:47.680]  It is good to have you on the line with us.
[53:47.680 --> 53:48.680]  Thank you, Alex.
[53:48.680 --> 53:50.800]  I'd like to congratulate you on a prison planet TV.
[53:50.800 --> 53:51.800]  It looks good.
[53:51.800 --> 53:52.800]  Well, thank you.
[53:52.800 --> 53:55.880]  I'd like to go to Web 2.0 with that and have it be a better format.
[53:55.880 --> 53:58.600]  But the quality of the videos is now tough life.
[53:58.600 --> 53:59.600]  Okay.
[53:59.600 --> 54:03.320]  Well, the reason I called, I wanted to say that if after the troops are on the street,
[54:03.320 --> 54:05.800]  stage terror is the next stage, we better start warning people about it.
[54:05.800 --> 54:06.800]  Well, yeah.
[54:06.800 --> 54:09.280]  Now, it'll be, oh, the troops are here helping with car wrecks.
[54:09.280 --> 54:11.960]  Oh, and as I told you now, it's in the news all over.
[54:11.960 --> 54:13.480]  Oh, troops are here.
[54:13.480 --> 54:14.480]  Why is the army here?
[54:14.480 --> 54:16.480]  Oh, they're here to help at a checkpoint.
[54:16.480 --> 54:20.760]  Oh, they're looking for drunk drivers, you know, now announced in California, you know,
[54:20.760 --> 54:21.760]  now announced in Texas.
[54:21.760 --> 54:24.480]  I mean, do you see how they're just creeping this in?
[54:24.480 --> 54:27.520]  Oh, well, I knew this was coming 15 years ago.
[54:27.520 --> 54:30.840]  Well, that's because you hate America, like Smedley Butler.
[54:30.840 --> 54:33.960]  Hey, Alex, do you want the Terror Storm bibliography?
[54:33.960 --> 54:34.960]  Yes, sir.
[54:34.960 --> 54:36.480]  You're the guy that made that.
[54:36.480 --> 54:37.480]  Yeah.
[54:37.480 --> 54:38.480]  The in-game one, too.
[54:38.480 --> 54:39.480]  Yeah.
[54:39.480 --> 54:40.480]  That's right.
[54:40.480 --> 54:42.480]  What is the in-game.com and the Terror Storm?
[54:42.480 --> 54:43.480]  What is it?
[54:43.480 --> 54:44.480]  Martiallaw911.info.
[54:44.480 --> 54:46.480]  No, that was a different guy.
[54:46.480 --> 54:51.680]  There was a guy who did the Martial Law one, and then I did the in-game one, but I got
[54:51.680 --> 54:53.760]  the Terror Storm one if you want to use it because it's still relevant.
[54:53.760 --> 54:54.760]  Okay.
[54:54.760 --> 54:58.120]  We'll send it all to Kurt and M.O. because, again, I checked out your bibliography on
[54:58.120 --> 55:03.560]  the last two films, excellent of the first film, and it's 100 percent, so send that
[55:03.560 --> 55:08.160]  to Kurt and M.O. and send that to Aaron at infowars.com, and we'll get it up on the
[55:08.160 --> 55:09.160]  site.
[55:09.160 --> 55:10.640]  Did Kurt have an e-mail or something?
[55:10.640 --> 55:11.640]  No.
[55:11.640 --> 55:12.640]  Yes.
[55:12.640 --> 55:13.640]  It's Kurt at infowars.com.
[55:13.640 --> 55:15.960]  Also, CC it to Aaron at infowars.com.
[55:15.960 --> 55:16.960]  Okay.
[55:16.960 --> 55:17.960]  All right.
[55:17.960 --> 55:18.960]  You're doing a great job.
[55:18.960 --> 55:19.960]  I'll keep it up.
[55:19.960 --> 55:20.960]  Anything else, sir?
[55:20.960 --> 55:21.960]  Nope.
[55:21.960 --> 55:22.960]  No, you're just speaking the truth.
[55:22.960 --> 55:23.960]  It's obvious.
[55:23.960 --> 55:25.680]  I've seen this coming for almost two decades, though.
[55:25.680 --> 55:27.920]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[55:27.920 --> 55:28.920]  Yes.
[55:28.920 --> 55:31.760]  That's the volunteer that made the bibliography for my film, In-Game.
[55:31.760 --> 55:35.480]  I'm so busy getting the data and doing the research that most filmmakers don't have a
[55:35.480 --> 55:36.960]  bibliography for their film.
[55:36.960 --> 55:41.160]  We do because he did one, but we vetted it, and sure enough, he found all the research
[55:41.160 --> 55:43.040]  we found and put it together.
[55:43.040 --> 55:48.560]  So every second of In-Game, which is really my most popular film ever, by the way, it's
[55:48.560 --> 55:51.320]  best-selling by double.
[55:51.320 --> 55:54.640]  It's the film that's the most effective side issue.
[55:54.640 --> 55:56.800]  Get it on DVD at infowars.com.
[55:56.800 --> 56:01.600]  And then follow along with the website, WhatIsTheIn-Game.com or In-GameMovie.com.
[56:01.600 --> 56:02.600]  Let's go ahead.
[56:02.600 --> 56:07.360]  When we tell you the UN public policy is to kill 80% of us, why?
[56:07.360 --> 56:12.160]  We have the official UN Biological Diversity Assessment right there for you, thanks to that
[56:12.160 --> 56:13.160]  fellow you just heard.
[56:13.160 --> 56:18.240]  I mean, I show video of it in the film, but I'm kind of the point of, you know what?
[56:18.240 --> 56:20.200]  I showed you the name and the number of the document.
[56:20.200 --> 56:21.200]  You can get it at the library.
[56:21.200 --> 56:23.720]  If you don't believe me, go jump off a cliff.
[56:23.720 --> 56:27.040]  But if somebody makes us a bibliography, I'll post it.
[56:27.040 --> 56:29.320]  Mark in Florida, you're on the air.
[56:29.320 --> 56:30.320]  Welcome.
[56:30.320 --> 56:31.320]  Yes.
[56:31.320 --> 56:32.320]  Hello.
[56:32.320 --> 56:33.320]  Hello, sir.
[56:33.320 --> 56:34.320]  Yes.
[56:34.320 --> 56:35.600]  How are you, Alex?
[56:35.600 --> 56:41.720]  I'm interested in the theme of secrecy and human nature, like I've been, I think I've
[56:41.720 --> 56:46.040]  asked you about it before, and I was just wondering two things.
[56:46.040 --> 56:51.720]  Number one, an easy question, how do you read a government document?
[56:51.720 --> 56:56.160]  I've tried to read these government documents, and I get bored and I fall asleep, and they
[56:56.160 --> 57:00.640]  seem really mealy-mouthed, and I find it difficult to...
[57:00.640 --> 57:06.360]  Well, okay, the best way to read a government document is in the continuity, you know, with
[57:06.360 --> 57:11.280]  the history of the infrastructure that document is plugging into.
[57:11.280 --> 57:16.000]  So it's kind of like, if you want to understand Godfather 3, you need to see Godfather 1.
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  And 2.
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  Or if you really...
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.320]  You really have to be rooted in history pretty well, then.
[57:21.320 --> 57:24.600]  I probably need to read more history, you know, to get some perspective.
[57:24.600 --> 57:28.960]  Well, I mean, you know, I mean, if you're going to look at the change in law to put
[57:28.960 --> 57:34.080]  troops on the streets, you've got to know why we got the 1878 Posse Comintatus Act.
[57:34.080 --> 57:36.200]  You've got to know about the Federalist Papers.
[57:36.200 --> 57:40.080]  You've got to understand what quartered among us meant, troops on the streets of the colonies,
[57:40.080 --> 57:42.960]  you know, going back to 1770s, 1780s.
[57:42.960 --> 57:45.800]  You've got to understand Third World countries.
[57:45.800 --> 57:50.560]  You've got to understand Roman history, you know, Caesar, bringing his legions into Rome.
[57:50.560 --> 57:55.480]  I mean, when they put troops on the streets, you're not in a free society.
[57:55.480 --> 57:59.520]  So then through that historical basis, then you study, I mean, the John Warner Defense
[57:59.520 --> 58:03.400]  Authorization Act, that's a good one to read on the troop issue, because it states right
[58:03.400 --> 58:08.480]  there that it's for civil insurrection, that the military is to engage the people.
[58:08.480 --> 58:11.520]  You could go read the Army War College report, we're linked to that.
[58:11.520 --> 58:13.480]  They state they're ready to splatter us.

[59:00.680 --> 59:02.160]  its current price.

[59:17.520 --> 59:19.360]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[59:19.360 --> 59:23.960]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[59:23.960 --> 59:24.960]  by you.
[59:24.960 --> 59:26.360]  But the symptoms are there.
[59:26.360 --> 59:31.180]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat

[1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:27.800]  You are listening to GCN at 90KLBJ, Austin, Texas.
[1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:33.400]  I am in USA Radio News.
[1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:39.080]  I'm Jody Jordan, around the Middle East, opponents of Israel and its air assault on Hamas targets
[1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:41.920]  in Gaza are making their anger known.
[1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:47.160]  In Lebanon, there were cries of death to Israel from a crowd of about 1,000 people.
[1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:48.160]  Here's Mark Levy.
[1:00:48.160 --> 1:00:52.280]  Israel has called up 6,500 reserve infantry forces.
[1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:55.160]  That's a clear sign that an invasion of Gaza is in the offing.
[1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:59.160]  In the meantime, Israel's air force is keeping up its attacks, hitting Hamas targets and
[1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:01.480]  security installations all over Gaza.
[1:01:01.480 --> 1:01:06.080]  When eight people are dead after a suicide bomb attack in Afghanistan, officials say
[1:01:06.080 --> 1:01:12.000]  the bomber tried to attack a meeting of tribal elders and blew himself up near a primary
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  school.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:14.520]  Here's Jason Straszewski.
[1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:18.320]  The attack came on the last day of school year for the children and the students had
[1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:22.200]  gathered in the classroom to receive end of year certificates.
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:24.560]  Features were also delivering books to the students.
[1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:28.120]  This is IRN, USA Radio News.
[1:01:28.120 --> 1:01:31.600]  If you've been watching the news lately, you've been hearing a lot about the obstacles in
[1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:32.600]  our economy.
[1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:36.800]  If you'll listen for just a few seconds, I'll share the opportunities that this economic
[1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:41.400]  downturn is offering to those with the energy, courage and know-how to take advantage of
[1:01:41.400 --> 1:01:42.400]  it.
[1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:43.760]  Hi, how in the world are you anyway?
[1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:47.520]  I'm Andy Willoughby with the Three Step Plan Home Business System.
[1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:52.320]  The Three Step Plan helps people feel better, look better and make more money.
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:56.920]  History has shown that our product line actually grows during an economic slowdown.
[1:01:56.920 --> 1:02:02.280]  Our newest product category actually grew 21% during the last 12 months while most business
[1:02:02.280 --> 1:02:04.800]  categories were dropping like a rock.
[1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:09.440]  With the Three Step Plan, you can help yourself and others develop another stream of income
[1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:13.720]  to survive and prosper in today's uncertain business climate.
[1:02:13.720 --> 1:02:15.960]  Don't wait for things to get worse.
[1:02:15.960 --> 1:02:18.080]  Check out the Three Step Plan today.
[1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:28.520]  Go to threestepplan.com or call 800-480-2102.
[1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:33.760]  The forecast calls for clear skies today in the Midwest, a day after some summer-like
[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:35.920]  weather a week into winter.
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:40.160]  The region was founded with hell, high winds and even funnel clouds.
[1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:43.920]  Much of Illinois, Missouri and Michigan are under a flood watch.
[1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:47.200]  Bruce Sullivan is a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
[1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:50.880]  For most of the country, the weather is fairly tranquil this time of year.
[1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:53.760]  We do have a weather system moving through the Great Lakes.
[1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:58.200]  Bring a little bit of snow to that region today, otherwise cold front associated with
[1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:01.200]  that is expected to push rapidly eastward.
[1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:05.840]  And with Pakistan shifting troops away from the Afghan border and into the border region
[1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:11.600]  with India, there are concerns that militant violence in the northwestern area could escalate.
[1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:16.640]  And those concerns were heightened today when a suicide bomber killed 26 people in a region
[1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:21.640]  where Pakistan's army has battled insurgents for more than a year.
[1:03:21.640 --> 1:03:30.120]  For more news and analysis, log on to IRN News dot com.
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:34.680]  The holidays are a time to celebrate with family and friends, but don't forget, it's
[1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:38.680]  also a time when cops will be cracking down on drunk drivers.
[1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:43.680]  It doesn't matter who you are or where you drive, if you drive drunk you will get caught
[1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:47.600]  and you will get arrested, so go to parties and have fun this holiday.
[1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:51.760]  But don't forget that cops will be out in force, if you get drunk, do not get behind
[1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:58.520]  the wheel over the limit under arrest, paid for by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
[1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:03.200]  Herman Rosenblatt's story about how he met his wife Roma has been held as a great love
[1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:08.920]  story, but now its truth has been called into question and the book scrapped.
[1:04:08.920 --> 1:04:13.320]  Here's Bob Eller, the Rosenblats were interviewed twice over the years by Oprah Winfrey, who
[1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:17.920]  has called their romance the single greatest love story ever told on her show.
[1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:21.320]  In a statement issued through his agent, Herman Rosenblatt says he wanted to bring
[1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:25.640]  happiness and hope to people and his motivation was to make good in this world.
[1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:30.560]  U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue crews continue their efforts to find an American woman who
[1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:33.360]  reportedly fell from a cruise ship.
[1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:37.240]  The Mexican Navy has also been searching the waters off Cancun.
[1:04:37.240 --> 1:04:41.840]  Coast Guard spokesman Nick Amin describes how searchers are looking for the missing woman.
[1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:46.640]  We have a starting position about 15 miles east of Cancun, Mexico.
[1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:51.680]  They take many variables such as weather, the water current, and they expand on that
[1:04:51.680 --> 1:04:55.800]  point as time progresses, that search pattern keeps expanding.
[1:04:55.800 --> 1:05:00.040]  An environmentalist are accusing government officials in Tennessee of downplaying the
[1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:03.480]  health risks from a giant sludge spill.
[1:05:03.480 --> 1:05:08.240]  More than a billion gallons of potentially toxic residue flooded out of a containment
[1:05:08.240 --> 1:05:12.640]  reservoir Monday at a coal-fired power plant.
[1:05:12.640 --> 1:05:17.520]  Residents Jeffrey Spurgeon lives in the neighborhood that was flooded with ash and water on Monday.
[1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:21.760]  This whole cove is eight foot deep, two hundred foot wide, I'm half a mile long, it's full
[1:05:21.760 --> 1:05:22.760]  of this sludge.
[1:05:22.760 --> 1:05:27.120]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.
[1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:30.680]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[1:05:30.680 --> 1:05:34.480]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the
[1:05:34.480 --> 1:05:40.160]  world. Utopia Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver
[1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:45.160]  who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates
[1:05:45.160 --> 1:05:46.720]  or saline solutions.
[1:05:46.720 --> 1:05:51.280]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized
[1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:55.960]  at the cellular level and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day
[1:05:55.960 --> 1:05:57.280]  antibiotics.
[1:05:57.280 --> 1:06:02.160]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver, gold, and copper
[1:06:02.160 --> 1:06:05.480]  with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[1:06:05.480 --> 1:06:09.760]  For four years Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that
[1:06:09.760 --> 1:06:13.640]  would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.
[1:06:13.640 --> 1:06:25.120]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com, that's utopiasilver.com or call 888-213-4338, 888-213-4338
[1:06:25.120 --> 1:06:26.440]  and help us win this battle.
[1:06:26.440 --> 1:06:45.120]  He stands for truth, he stands for justice, he stands for what's right, this is the Alex
[1:06:45.120 --> 1:06:47.120]  Jones show.
[1:06:47.120 --> 1:07:07.120]  You know there's a hundred subjects I could cover and I am going to get into the economy
[1:07:07.120 --> 1:07:15.320]  and what's happening between India and Pakistan, Israel and the Gaza Strip right now.
[1:07:15.320 --> 1:07:19.120]  The European Union, the United States, China, they're all teaming up to start censoring
[1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:20.120]  the Internet.
[1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:24.960]  The general public of course isn't aware of that on average, talk some about that.
[1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:30.880]  But I mean how do I not discuss the fact that there's a huge long-term covert operation
[1:07:30.880 --> 1:07:39.120]  to basically abolish Congress where Congress is just a front ceremonial, abolish the state
[1:07:39.120 --> 1:07:45.600]  governments and be ruled by the Pentagon, openly bought and paid for by foreign banks
[1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:51.720]  while the foreign banks steal all of our pension funds and raise taxes to regulate and control
[1:07:51.720 --> 1:07:52.720]  our lives.
[1:07:52.720 --> 1:08:00.600]  I mean New York State alone just passed 88 new taxes, they got a franchise tax in Texas,
[1:08:00.600 --> 1:08:07.280]  it's really a business tax, like an income tax on businesses, oh the crooks.
[1:08:07.280 --> 1:08:10.880]  And again the politicians aren't getting hardly any of the money, it's incredible how cheaply
[1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:12.840]  they're bought.
[1:08:12.840 --> 1:08:18.240]  It's the foreign brokerage firms, that's where your tax money is invested, 60 plus percent
[1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:19.480]  of it off books.
[1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:25.160]  All right, going back to Mark in Florida, Mark you were saying you don't understand
[1:08:25.160 --> 1:08:31.440]  how to read, who was I talking to last, was it Mark or was it, okay it was Mark in Florida.
[1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:35.120]  Mark you were saying, I mean I don't understand your question, what do you mean you don't
[1:08:35.120 --> 1:08:37.920]  understand how to read government documents?
[1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:47.680]  Well I, what I was saying was that a lot of times that I missed the real point you know
[1:08:47.680 --> 1:08:55.800]  that I don't pull out of it, like right now I'm reading that Kissinger document from 1970,
[1:08:55.800 --> 1:09:01.000]  I think it's defense policy 200 and it just seems like oh they're trying to be nice and
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:04.920]  control the population so that people don't starve, that kind of thing.
[1:09:04.920 --> 1:09:08.360]  Being State Department memorandum 200.
[1:09:08.360 --> 1:09:12.840]  Yeah the big, the one, no I haven't gotten that far on it but I've just been, I've been,
[1:09:12.840 --> 1:09:15.520]  you know I'm just trying to try it out to see what I see.
[1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:20.080]  Yeah the quickest way to do that is to Google the name of it and then people have culled
[1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:23.560]  out the key parts, then you go check and make sure those parts are there.
[1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:30.160]  But they talk about US policy being a reduction of the third world by 50 percent, they talk
[1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:34.360]  about using food as a weapon, they talk about using IMF and World Bank loans to control
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:39.120]  those governments and there's sub-directives that have separately been declassified so
[1:09:39.120 --> 1:09:47.040]  it's all compartmentalized but you can also read the United Nations biological diversity
[1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:48.540]  assessments.
[1:09:48.540 --> 1:09:52.040]  But 96 is one of the really evil ones and it's all there.
[1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:56.760]  96 I'll pull it, I'll pull it, I think I'll get a biodiversity assessment 96 and pull
[1:09:56.760 --> 1:10:00.840]  it up and see if I can, I just got a lot of reading to do, I'm a slow reader that's my
[1:10:00.840 --> 1:10:01.840]  thing.
[1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:07.920]  I think people have already done the work for you, like check out US Code Title 50 Chapter
[1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:12.680]  32, Subsection 1520A, paragraph B.
[1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:17.360]  And is that the one where they, I think I looked at that once because I heard you give
[1:10:17.360 --> 1:10:18.360]  that.
[1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:19.840]  Go ahead and tell everybody because you'd say it better than me.
[1:10:19.840 --> 1:10:24.320]  Well no, no, I mean if you look at things like US Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection
[1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:31.800]  1520A, paragraph B, you know it states, oh you know the whole header in the US Code
[1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:37.520]  says you're not allowed to do secret chemical, biological, radiological testing on the American
[1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:38.520]  people.
[1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:42.400]  And then it says in that section unless it's for research and then you can do whatever
[1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:44.880]  you want including lethal.
[1:10:44.880 --> 1:10:47.440]  I mean it's just incredible.
[1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:48.440]  You know I've heard that.
[1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:53.560]  Listen sir, how do you think, why do you think in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s they would
[1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:58.720]  march US troops into chambers and murder them, our own government.
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:04.280]  So before the scientists would murder our troops, they had to have a go ahead to do
[1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:05.280]  it.
[1:11:05.280 --> 1:11:11.640]  And so they gave them US Code and the sub chapters we just talked about.
[1:11:11.640 --> 1:11:17.640]  And you can read that at any government site or law university site.
[1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:22.840]  And I mean that's, they play God, they see us as animals.
[1:11:22.840 --> 1:11:27.280]  Of course they carried out 9-11, they've murdered thousands of our own troops.
[1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:33.240]  But not just to kill troops to find out who would follow orders to kill troops to create
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:34.240]  those Codres.
[1:11:34.240 --> 1:11:35.240]  I appreciate your call.
[1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:37.720]  I'm wearing a lot of trouble folks.
[1:11:37.720 --> 1:11:40.960]  Let me go ahead and talk to Aaron in Arizona.
[1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:41.960]  You're on the air, Aaron.
[1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:42.960]  How's it going?
[1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:45.920]  Alex, I just want to start out by letting you know I'm a big fan of yours.
[1:11:45.920 --> 1:11:47.440]  I'm a fan of you sir.
[1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:48.440]  What's on your mind?
[1:11:48.440 --> 1:11:53.800]  Well listen, my quick question is I recently heard you talking about how the central banks
[1:11:53.800 --> 1:11:58.360]  are going to be cutting off liquidity to the real market and the population of the world.
[1:11:58.360 --> 1:12:03.840]  And they're kind of conduit all the fiat money to themselves and while there's still value
[1:12:03.840 --> 1:12:05.240]  left in their...
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:09.000]  They're buying up real assets while they'll advertise, oh we made a hundred million dollar
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.680]  investment for old people or something.
[1:12:11.680 --> 1:12:14.800]  That is a pittance compared to the tens of trillions they've stolen and then they're
[1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:18.320]  leveraging those trillions in the market.
[1:12:18.320 --> 1:12:19.320]  Right.
[1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:20.320]  Right.
[1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:23.440]  I guess you probably discussed this before but like I said I recently started listening
[1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:26.240]  and I apologize if this has been discussed.
[1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:32.880]  But as individuals, let's just say the fortunate of us that do have a bank account that aren't
[1:12:32.880 --> 1:12:37.400]  in any debt right now, what can we, I mean really what do I need to be doing right now
[1:12:37.400 --> 1:12:38.400]  to get ready?
[1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:41.960]  I mean like stocking up on food, I've heard you guys talking about, I mean is there some
[1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:47.360]  real ideas or are there things that we can do for ourselves because I believe that they
[1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:49.800]  are going to bankrupt the US dollar soon?
[1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:52.520]  Well I want to be clear here.
[1:12:52.520 --> 1:12:56.880]  You know they had the system in place for total martial law, the executive orders, the
[1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:04.440]  PDDs, the training, the FEMA camps in the late 90s and so people got upset then and said
[1:13:04.440 --> 1:13:05.440]  this could happen anytime.
[1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:09.920]  It's kind of like the head of the country's been under the guillotine for decades.
[1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:15.480]  Now it just looks like, you know before the executioner was standing upright smoking a
[1:13:15.480 --> 1:13:20.760]  pipe, now he's got his hand on the lever and we're going he may pull it, he may pull it,
[1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:21.760]  he may pull it.
[1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:24.160]  You know I don't know if all of this is going to happen.
[1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:30.640]  All I know is they've built underground bunkers, they've hoarded food and water and weapons
[1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:35.080]  and the private banks over the decade ago said they were going to engineer a world banking
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:37.560]  collapse to bring in their new world order.
[1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:38.560]  Now they've done that.
[1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:42.560]  Now we've seen hundreds of mainstream articles like the Financial Times of London two weeks
[1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:48.440]  ago saying headline and now for world government and they say there is a world government,
[1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:53.240]  they've kept it secret from you, it is tyrannical but it's for your own good.
[1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:57.160]  We're going to fix the banking crisis when the world government is the banks and the
[1:13:57.160 --> 1:13:59.320]  article admits it's the banks.
[1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:02.120]  So it's just an asinine fact.
[1:14:02.120 --> 1:14:05.720]  So they're going to terrorize the public, implode the economy further and now they've
[1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:10.880]  got all these IMF world bank chiefs and presidents and prime ministers and world leaders on TV
[1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:15.960]  and radio and print saying it's a total collapse saying it's a depression.
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:20.360]  I was watching CNN today and they had all these world financial experts on saying global
[1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:25.760]  governments the answer, you know, all of this garbage when they engineered it.
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:28.840]  And so I think they're going to go ahead and drop the hammer fully.
[1:14:28.840 --> 1:14:33.360]  The question is how bad is that hammer going to hit clanging us on top or noggin?
[1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:39.080]  So you know, I mean, look, I personally, the network I'm on Genesis was founded, owned
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:41.300]  and run by a gold company.
[1:14:41.300 --> 1:14:45.920]  So I'll tell you out of the gates when I'm telling you buy gold by silver, you know,
[1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:50.440]  not only do I believe in it, not only have I bought it myself when it was 300 bucks an
[1:14:50.440 --> 1:14:56.760]  ounce or $5 an ounce, you know, gold and silver, gold was 300 silver was $5.5 an ounce when
[1:14:56.760 --> 1:15:00.880]  I bought some, you know, and it's tripled in value.
[1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:03.160]  The bankers could play some game and lower it again.
[1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:04.880]  I don't think they are.
[1:15:04.880 --> 1:15:08.440]  But you know, I mean, let me just out front here say I have an interest to push gold and
[1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:12.560]  silver, but I, I, I push what I believe in to begin with.
[1:15:12.560 --> 1:15:15.160]  So you know, it's, you know, like to ask an artist, well, why do you paint pennies?
[1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:18.920]  Well, because I love to paint and it's a side issue that I'm involved in the, in the marketing
[1:15:18.920 --> 1:15:21.920]  of it.
[1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:24.120]  So, so I believe in gold and silver.
[1:15:24.120 --> 1:15:26.520]  I believe you should be 20, 30% in that.
[1:15:26.520 --> 1:15:29.440]  I wouldn't be in any paper right now.
[1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:35.280]  I mean, if you understand market fluctuation, you could be in, you know, the, the, the put
[1:15:35.280 --> 1:15:41.680]  options, you know, going long, going short, but, but I mean, that's very dangerous there.
[1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:46.280]  I mean, I mean, if I was you, I would be in cash and I would be in gold and silver and
[1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:51.320]  I would be liquid and I wouldn't be taking on a lot of debts.
[1:15:51.320 --> 1:15:52.320]  Right.
[1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:54.880]  And then, and then one more quick thing on a personal note, of course, I don't want to
[1:15:54.880 --> 1:16:01.760]  get too personal on the air, but let's just say my family does own a lot of land back
[1:16:01.760 --> 1:16:06.080]  east, we'll say in my family has began to kind of make preparations.
[1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:10.520]  Do you think that's a wise idea for me and for others listening to the kind of, well,
[1:16:10.520 --> 1:16:15.280]  I mean, I mean, the truly wealthy people I know evacuated the United States a year ago.
[1:16:15.280 --> 1:16:17.040]  They said that was their drop dead day.
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:18.960]  So, let me, let me ask that question.
[1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:28.080]  We get back into here for him, you sir, Kevin, Chris, Igor's first, we get back, hi, John
[1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:32.000]  Humner from Midas Resources, are you tired of watching your hard earned assets dwindle
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:36.400]  away as government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess
[1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:38.120]  of 20 billion a week?
[1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:41.280]  Are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard earned money?

[1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:54.000]  Oh man, you know I wish I wasn't right about all this stuff, but if you know about human
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:21:01.120]  history there's emperors and corrupt systems and subterfuge and court intrigue and different
[1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:05.400]  groups, bidding and vying for power.
[1:21:05.400 --> 1:21:10.920]  There's always corrupt elites that think they're God and seek to enslave the population and
[1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:16.240]  there's always decadent slobs who did have liberty and freedom because of their ancestors
[1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:21.200]  who get lackadaisical and sit on their laurels and then great tyranny comes.
[1:21:21.200 --> 1:21:26.080]  And then the people stand up and fight back and if they're blessed they're able to get
[1:21:26.080 --> 1:21:31.360]  liberty again and then they guard that liberty for a generation or two because they know
[1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:36.560]  how hard won, hard fought it is and then over time the tyranny just comes back again because
[1:21:36.560 --> 1:21:39.920]  their children and those children's children become slobs.
[1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:43.960]  We're in a lot of trouble, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:21:43.960 --> 1:21:49.600]  Close to $10 trillion has been stolen, stolen from the American taxpayer by private offshore
[1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:54.680]  banks in just the last eight, nine weeks and it's only going to get worse and the very
[1:21:54.680 --> 1:21:58.160]  banks that have done this, that are flush with capital, brag that they're flush with
[1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:03.920]  capital and they have cut off liquidity to Main Street so that the real economy falls
[1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:09.640]  apart so that the banking economy can take over the rest of society.
[1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:13.760]  This is being done in a cold-blooded fashion, only speaking up and standing up against it
[1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:14.760]  can stop it.
[1:22:14.760 --> 1:22:17.360]  Let's go ahead and talk to Igor in Virginia.
[1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:18.760]  Igor, you're on the air.
[1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:19.760]  How are you doing?
[1:22:19.760 --> 1:22:21.760]  It's a lovely show, man.
[1:22:21.760 --> 1:22:22.760]  Welcome.
[1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:23.760]  Thank you for having me back.
[1:22:23.760 --> 1:22:24.760]  Let's go ahead.
[1:22:24.760 --> 1:22:30.280]  Sir, I just want to say that Obama had a great opportunity to condemn the attack on Gaza
[1:22:30.280 --> 1:22:33.440]  and he didn't issue a comment on that day.
[1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:39.280]  I bet anybody that if over 200 Israelis were killed, innocent civilians, he would come
[1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:45.160]  out and quit his vacation in Hawaii and have a press conference on all major media channels
[1:22:45.160 --> 1:22:48.680]  and call it an act of terrorism by Palestine.
[1:22:48.680 --> 1:22:52.480]  But since Israel did it, he's an APEC member, so he's not going to do anything about it.
[1:22:52.480 --> 1:22:55.400]  Anyway, thank you for having me on your show.
[1:22:55.400 --> 1:22:56.400]  Thank you.
[1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:57.400]  I appreciate your call.
[1:22:57.400 --> 1:23:04.520]  Look, it is a nuanced issue, as they say, and look, I'll come out and attack any country
[1:23:04.520 --> 1:23:05.520]  I want.
[1:23:05.520 --> 1:23:08.800]  I mean, if I think it's right to do.
[1:23:08.800 --> 1:23:15.200]  And what Israel did in Lebanon two years ago was a disproportionate response.
[1:23:15.200 --> 1:23:20.160]  It ended up coming out in Israeli papers that they did send in their own troops, setting
[1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:25.080]  them up to be captured as in a pretext to go in.
[1:23:25.080 --> 1:23:26.480]  And that was a escalation.
[1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:32.960]  And Israel was repulsed by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the Shiite-backed Hezbollah.
[1:23:32.960 --> 1:23:36.520]  Now this is Hamas in Gaza.
[1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:44.000]  And Hamas was set up in the mid-70s as a, quote, counterbalance against the People's
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:51.080]  Liberation Army, or organization, Yasser Arafat.
[1:23:51.080 --> 1:23:53.680]  So it gets into all this divide and conquer.
[1:23:53.680 --> 1:23:57.280]  The Arabs are not one unified group.
[1:23:57.280 --> 1:24:08.080]  And then Israel, I guess, thought things were going to go in a different direction and allowed
[1:24:08.080 --> 1:24:16.320]  these groups to get control of the Gaza Strip, Hamas to.
[1:24:16.320 --> 1:24:18.320]  And it is a real mess.
[1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:25.840]  I mean, there are rebels, you could call them, in the populated areas, using the populated
[1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:35.360]  areas as cover to fire these Khatusha rockets, which are glorified, you know, glorified homemade
[1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:36.660]  rockets.
[1:24:36.660 --> 1:24:37.800]  But they do kill people.
[1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:40.720]  Every week, somebody gets killed by one.
[1:24:40.720 --> 1:24:47.260]  And Israel now is talking about invading Gaza itself, so that is going to be quite a loss
[1:24:47.260 --> 1:24:48.260]  of life.
[1:24:48.260 --> 1:24:49.760]  Tens of thousands of this continues.
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:54.400]  They're talking about 900 wounded now, more than 300 dead.
[1:24:54.400 --> 1:24:56.400]  Those are the latest numbers.
[1:24:56.400 --> 1:24:59.920]  And the Israeli stock market is plunging.
[1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:03.480]  I mean, I'm not saying that Israel should just sit there and let people shoot rockets
[1:25:03.480 --> 1:25:04.480]  at them.
[1:25:04.480 --> 1:25:09.120]  At the same time, three or four people die in the U.S. every day of running into deer
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:13.200]  on the highway, and when you get one person on average dying a week in Israel from one
[1:25:13.200 --> 1:25:19.640]  of these rockets, it's certainly not fun having them drop on your house or school.
[1:25:19.640 --> 1:25:27.920]  But this will only embolden the resistance, and they originally founded Hamas two-stage
[1:25:27.920 --> 1:25:30.800]  terror attacks to kill different peace steels.
[1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:35.440]  Hurt Nemo up on infowars.com a few days ago, not a few days ago yesterday, wrote a story
[1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:41.000]  called Obama Silent on Gaza Rage.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:45.960]  And in that, he gives links to the mainstream news articles where they admit, in Israeli
[1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:51.040]  papers admit, that Israel stages terror attacks through Hamas.
[1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:53.120]  That's the group they have the most control over.
[1:25:53.120 --> 1:25:57.760]  I'm not saying they run Hamas, but they certainly have their people in it and provocateurs in
[1:25:57.760 --> 1:26:02.480]  it, and they do stage terror attacks at key points when Israel doesn't want peace because
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:05.880]  Israel, the Israeli military, wants to continue running that country.
[1:26:05.880 --> 1:26:07.120]  So those are just the facts.
[1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:08.680]  I just report the facts here.
[1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:13.000]  I'm not taking sides in all of this.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:16.840]  It's disgusting when you see the video of the children with their arms and legs blown
[1:26:16.840 --> 1:26:17.840]  off.
[1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:18.840]  Let's take another call.
[1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:21.480]  Kevin in Massachusetts, you're on the air, Kevin.
[1:26:21.480 --> 1:26:22.480]  Hello.
[1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:23.480]  Hi, Alex.
[1:26:23.480 --> 1:26:24.480]  Hello.
[1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:25.480]  Hi, Alex.
[1:26:25.480 --> 1:26:26.480]  Are you there?
[1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:27.480]  Yes, sir.
[1:26:27.480 --> 1:26:29.000]  I'm a real listener, a real fan of yours.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:33.360]  I think you're about the only instance of what I would call the uncontrolled opposition
[1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:34.360]  left.
[1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:36.720]  But anyhow, I have two points I'd like to ask you about.
[1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:40.720]  Number one, does the name Benjamin Fulford ring a bell with you?
[1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:41.720]  Yeah.
[1:26:41.720 --> 1:26:42.720]  And who is it?
[1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:46.200]  Because my memory, like you'll know a name and then you don't remember who they are.
[1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:47.200]  Okay.
[1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:48.200]  He's a Canadian fellow.
[1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:49.200]  He's based in Tokyo.
[1:26:49.200 --> 1:26:50.200]  He was the head of Forbes.
[1:26:50.200 --> 1:26:51.200]  Oh, yeah.
[1:26:51.200 --> 1:26:52.200]  No, no, I mean, I've interviewed him three or four times.
[1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:54.000]  He used to write for Forbes.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  Right.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:59.480]  And he says that there's this big Asian global mafia that's aware of the New World Order
[1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:03.840]  and about to strike back and all this, and then he's able to get meetings with David Rockefeller
[1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:04.840]  and people.
[1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:05.840]  Sure, of course.
[1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:06.840]  Right, exactly.
[1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:07.840]  Of course I knew he is.
[1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:08.840]  Do you think he's credible?
[1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:12.680]  You know, I believe he believes the things he's saying, and I believe that a lot of what
[1:27:12.680 --> 1:27:14.640]  he's saying is true.
[1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:20.120]  But you know, I want to try to be nice about all this.
[1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:23.920]  He comes off a little wacky sometimes.
[1:27:23.920 --> 1:27:24.920]  But so do I.
[1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:26.200]  You know, the truth is wacky.
[1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:27.200]  Right.
[1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:28.200]  Okay.
[1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:29.200]  Question number two here.
[1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:32.520]  I was, you know, I'm a fan of yours for several years now and I have a lot of your DVDs.
[1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:33.920]  I was looking over one last night.
[1:27:33.920 --> 1:27:37.640]  I was watching comprehensive annual financial reports exposed.
[1:27:37.640 --> 1:27:38.640]  Yes.
[1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:39.640]  Okay.
[1:27:39.640 --> 1:27:41.160]  I'm just kind of curious, you know, where did all that money go?
[1:27:41.160 --> 1:27:43.640]  Is it like all gone now?
[1:27:43.640 --> 1:27:46.680]  Well for those that don't know, everybody should watch comprehensive annual financial
[1:27:46.680 --> 1:27:47.680]  reports exposed.
[1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:49.560]  People say, well, that sounds boring.
[1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:55.000]  If you think tiny water districts having hundreds of millions in secret bank accounts
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:59.920]  on the record, or if you think every major school district stealing money and basically
[1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:08.040]  being mafia fronts, if you think that 65% of all the tax money you pay goes directly
[1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:14.720]  to offshore banks and is a huge fraud based out of a Chicago mafia model, the Chicago
[1:28:14.720 --> 1:28:21.320]  1313 model that went nationwide the 1950s, then you shouldn't care about it.
[1:28:21.320 --> 1:28:23.800]  Where it went was into the hands of the globalist.
[1:28:23.800 --> 1:28:28.080]  How do you think the New World Order buys everything up and has so much power?
[1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:29.400]  They run scams.
[1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:33.120]  They don't just control the private central banks that control the issuance of currency
[1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:38.960]  and every time a dollar or a pound or a yen or a yawn or a euro is created, debt is paid
[1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:40.160]  to the bankers.
[1:28:40.160 --> 1:28:42.760]  They also get your local money.
[1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:45.200]  And that's what this control collapses about.
[1:28:45.200 --> 1:28:48.600]  So they can claim all that money was just lost when it isn't lost.
[1:28:48.600 --> 1:28:51.840]  Look, I told people a year before Enron got in trouble, get out of Enron.
[1:28:51.840 --> 1:28:56.280]  It was a front, a money laundering up because I had sources in Houston.
[1:28:56.280 --> 1:28:57.600]  I'll just leave it at that.
[1:28:57.600 --> 1:28:59.120]  What happened?
[1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:00.120]  What happened?
[1:29:00.120 --> 1:29:02.200]  It turned out it was a total front.
[1:29:02.200 --> 1:29:07.040]  Remember that he later became secretary of the army, white would give the legislature
[1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:11.360]  of California tours of fake computers with fake computer training.
[1:29:11.360 --> 1:29:15.080]  Because the stock market isn't even real, it's all just made up, sir.
[1:29:15.080 --> 1:29:16.080]  You understand?
[1:29:16.080 --> 1:29:17.080]  You're sure, duality.
[1:29:17.080 --> 1:29:18.080]  Thanks very much.
[1:29:18.080 --> 1:29:21.600]  And I sent you some websites on Navy Building and Army a couple of weeks ago.
[1:29:21.600 --> 1:29:22.600]  I hope you got them.
[1:29:22.600 --> 1:29:23.600]  We did get them.
[1:29:23.600 --> 1:29:24.600]  I saw them in Aaron's email.
[1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:25.600]  I'll try to get them to post them.
[1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:26.600]  We'll be right back.
[1:29:26.600 --> 1:29:28.600]  The headlines are clear.
[1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:31.920]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[1:29:31.920 --> 1:29:34.600]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[1:29:34.600 --> 1:29:37.160]  The market of beast is at hand.
[1:29:37.160 --> 1:29:40.320]  Governments are calling for a New World cashless economic system.
[1:29:40.320 --> 1:29:42.960]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.
[1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:43.960]  To stay free.

[1:32:26.840 --> 1:32:30.320]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight?
[1:32:30.320 --> 1:32:33.760]  Only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not

[1:33:20.960 --> 1:33:25.160]  That's 877-715-4448.
[1:33:25.160 --> 1:33:32.760]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:36.760]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:33:36.760 --> 1:33:49.560]  Yeah, you let the military industrial complex get in control and now the bankers are going
[1:33:49.560 --> 1:33:52.440]  to steal your blind.
[1:33:52.440 --> 1:34:06.080]  These people are razor sharp, and if they get their way, they will slice you apart.
[1:34:06.080 --> 1:34:13.320]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and if the new world order gets your name, well,
[1:34:13.320 --> 1:34:18.440]  you might not make it back.
[1:34:18.440 --> 1:34:32.680]  A new world order likes to kill in their wake, you see dead bodies burning cities, and now
[1:34:32.680 --> 1:34:40.040]  they want to bring down the U.S., but of course, you'll hail them while they steal you blind.
[1:34:40.040 --> 1:34:47.880]  You'll hail them as they bring down the Republic, and they haven't even turned on the juice
[1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:48.880]  yet.
[1:34:48.880 --> 1:34:54.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, they haven't even released the bio weapons yet, but when the clock strikes
[1:34:54.960 --> 1:35:10.680]  midnight, and she'll turn on the power, we're back live, thank you for joining us.
[1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:12.200]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:17.520]  You know, I can sit around and joke about this, but this is deadly, dangerous, real.
[1:35:17.520 --> 1:35:18.520]  They're going for broke.
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:21.400]  They wouldn't have stole $4 trillion from the Pentagon.
[1:35:21.400 --> 1:35:26.440]  They wouldn't have stolen almost $9 trillion that we know of, of taxpayer money the last
[1:35:26.440 --> 1:35:29.160]  nine weeks if they weren't planning to go for broke.
[1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:30.160]  You got that.
[1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:35.440]  They're going to pose up there on the media like your saviors with all these international
[1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:40.480]  bankers, the very culprits, the very authors of what we see happening, selling you on their
[1:35:40.480 --> 1:35:46.160]  next solution, which is military occupation and the government running every facet of
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:48.200]  your life.
[1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:52.240]  And as society breaks down, the crime rate explodes, they'll tell you, hey, we got some
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:56.440]  heroes in uniform, turn your guns into them, they'll take good care of you.
[1:35:56.440 --> 1:35:58.800]  And if you do, we'll feed you.
[1:35:58.800 --> 1:36:01.800]  Now that's how bad it's going to get if we don't say no to these folks.
[1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:05.680]  I want to cover some other news items, but let's continue with your phone calls.
[1:36:05.680 --> 1:36:08.440]  Let's talk to Shanine in Austin.
[1:36:08.440 --> 1:36:09.960]  You're on the air, then Chris and others.
[1:36:09.960 --> 1:36:10.960]  Go ahead, Shanine.
[1:36:10.960 --> 1:36:11.960]  Yes.
[1:36:11.960 --> 1:36:12.960]  Thank you so much.
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:13.960]  It's a Shaheen, actually.
[1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:14.960]  Shaheen.
[1:36:14.960 --> 1:36:17.440]  Yes, thank you so much for having me on.
[1:36:17.440 --> 1:36:20.760]  I'm half-Iranian, but not that that matters.
[1:36:20.760 --> 1:36:25.360]  I just was very upset, and thank you so much for having your show about, I'm just very
[1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:28.880]  upset what's happening in the Gaza right now.
[1:36:28.880 --> 1:36:30.840]  I grew up in Saudi Arabia.
[1:36:30.840 --> 1:36:36.800]  My father was with Ramco very early on, and I got to know the Palestinian people and
[1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:38.120]  their story.
[1:36:38.120 --> 1:36:43.760]  And unfortunately, I think in this country, we're just, we're just led as to who's the
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:45.400]  good guys and who's the bad guys.
[1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:48.160]  I am not anti-Semitic.
[1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:54.600]  I have- Well, actually, I mean, being Arab is Semitic, so why would you be against yourself?
[1:36:54.600 --> 1:36:57.480]  I mean, Semitic just means Semitic people.
[1:36:57.480 --> 1:36:59.800]  No, no, you're exactly right.
[1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:01.960]  We're all like cousins and stuff.
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:03.920]  No, I agree with you totally, Alex.
[1:37:03.920 --> 1:37:04.920]  Totally, totally.
[1:37:04.920 --> 1:37:05.920]  That's totally right.
[1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:11.440]  But I just think that this whole drama, we just can't have this happen.
[1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:13.240]  I mean, it's biblical.
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:18.040]  It's not even like, you know, it just, it's just not, it's just not a good thing.
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:21.920]  Well, every time the Middle East gets bombed, people think it's the end of the world.
[1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:25.920]  It's kind of a cough out, you know, with all these kids dying.
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:29.120]  But regardless, it's wrong what's going on over there.
[1:37:29.120 --> 1:37:31.440]  And- Thank you so much for taking my call.
[1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:32.440]  I appreciate it.
[1:37:32.440 --> 1:37:33.440]  Sure.
[1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:34.440]  I mean, do you have any comments about what's happening over there?
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:41.960]  Well, I think that, I think that Americans are kind of like, they're just more intelligent
[1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:46.360]  now or whatever, maybe the economic crisis or whatever, they're getting more in tune
[1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:47.360]  with it.
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:53.080]  And if they would just understand the whole Arab-Israeli conflict and kind of see what
[1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:59.120]  happened in the 1950s and get more educated about it, it doesn't have to be anti-Israeli
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:01.120]  or anti-Arab or whatever.
[1:38:01.120 --> 1:38:06.080]  But we would have all this drama and all this horrible terrorist issues and all this stuff
[1:38:06.080 --> 1:38:08.520]  would just be, it just basically-
[1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:11.280]  Well, you know, there's four different types of terrorism.
[1:38:11.280 --> 1:38:17.400]  There's real terrorism, then there's provocateur terrorism, there's stage terrorism, and then
[1:38:17.400 --> 1:38:21.560]  there's basically, you know, state-sponsored criminal terrorism where they use a separate
[1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:22.560]  criminal grip.
[1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:23.920]  It's another type of false flag.
[1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:30.280]  My only point looking at this is, is that Israel admits they founded Hamas as a counterbalance
[1:38:30.280 --> 1:38:31.560]  to the PLO.
[1:38:31.560 --> 1:38:37.760]  Now the PLO is kicked out of Gaza, and Israel's little creation from 1973 is in control.
[1:38:37.760 --> 1:38:38.760]  You are intelligent.
[1:38:38.760 --> 1:38:40.960]  Oh, I am not intelligent.
[1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:45.320]  I just read that out of Harass and the Jerusalem Post, but it's good to hear from you.
[1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:46.720]  So this stuff is more sophisticated.
[1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:51.760]  Now, there is a growing group of Americans, I'd say more than 50%, that are informed that
[1:38:51.760 --> 1:38:55.680]  do know what's going on, that are nonpartisan, that know our government's been hijacked,
[1:38:55.680 --> 1:39:00.240]  that know the new world order's real, who know how to read, you know, the globalists
[1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:02.760]  when they openly say they're setting up world government.
[1:39:02.760 --> 1:39:06.880]  But of the 50% that aren't awake, you've got mainline liberals, mainline conservatives
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:11.400]  that are so bought into the false paradigm that even as the mainstream media admits that
[1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:14.600]  that was a false paradigm, they won't wake up.
[1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:19.400]  And a lot of Americans, you know, say, nuke Pakistan, you know, nuke the Middle East.
[1:39:19.400 --> 1:39:21.120]  Pakistan isn't in the Middle East.
[1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:23.240]  It's in Central Asia.
[1:39:23.240 --> 1:39:29.560]  So the problem is a lot of Americans are about as dumb as this lady.
[1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:38.280]  I really believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in
[1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:44.480]  our nation don't have that, and I believe that our education, like such as in South
[1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:52.600]  Africa and Iraq, everywhere, like such as, and I believe that they should, our education
[1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:58.520]  over here in the U.S. should help the U.S. or should help South Africa and should help
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:03.720]  the Iraq and the Asian countries so we will be able to build up our future.
[1:40:03.720 --> 1:40:10.120]  Now, the establishment knows that they've got a bunch of schmucks who will believe whatever
[1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:15.560]  they're told in this nation, so that's why we're being used and abused.
[1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:21.520]  I mean, an example of this is 91% of Americans in three separate Gallup polls have seen that
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:26.320]  numbers always comes up in the last four years, want our borders controlled and don't want
[1:40:26.320 --> 1:40:31.760]  even more legal visas issued, much less illegal.
[1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:33.560]  People allowed in here.
[1:40:33.560 --> 1:40:34.560]  What do both parties do?
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:38.800]  They both push for amnesty, and then Congress, remember a year ago, said, oh, we're going
[1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:42.400]  to make this new immigration bill secret, immigration reform.
[1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:48.280]  Just trust us it is an amnesty, and then Senator Sessions leaked the bill, and there
[1:40:48.280 --> 1:40:52.160]  were 21 loopholes, and in a way it was true.
[1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:54.320]  It wasn't amnesty.
[1:40:54.320 --> 1:40:55.320]  It was worse.
[1:40:55.320 --> 1:41:00.640]  The aggravated felons were legal if they just signed a pledge and not do it again.
[1:41:00.640 --> 1:41:08.040]  So it was a pardon for felons and unlimited legalization and amnesty for nine years,
[1:41:08.040 --> 1:41:11.480]  seven guaranteed, but you could sign an extension.
[1:41:11.480 --> 1:41:14.320]  So the government says, trust us, we won't lie to you.
[1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:19.480]  This will end illegal immigration, but we won't show you the bill.
[1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:25.280]  And then now if Congress won't pass a bank or takeover bill, they're told by the executive
[1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:30.280]  we will just declare martial law then.
[1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:36.760]  Under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, and Senator Inhofe goes on TV and radio.
[1:41:36.760 --> 1:41:39.440]  Congressman Waters and a bunch of other, I had them on the radio.
[1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:42.880]  I didn't just get the C-SPAN clips and play them on my radio show.
[1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:45.800]  We called and got them on the show.
[1:41:45.800 --> 1:41:51.800]  And I had people emailing me saying it was fake interviews that we didn't interview.
[1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:56.400]  I mean, I've got a, I was on YouTube watching a video.
[1:41:56.400 --> 1:42:02.160]  Somebody put up a clip of my prisonplanet.tv show up there trying to find it now.
[1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:03.160]  I had it here in the stack.
[1:42:03.160 --> 1:42:04.560]  Oh, here it is.
[1:42:04.560 --> 1:42:09.000]  And this guy, it's Peter Sheff on Alex Jones TV Ponzi scheme.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:16.200]  One of three is the name of the video on YouTube and it's been up a few days.
[1:42:16.200 --> 1:42:19.000]  It's got 10,000 views.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:27.720]  Down here it says, it says, but this, but it's a good bet that this is all untrue unless
[1:42:27.720 --> 1:42:32.000]  there's some evidence for the contrary and there's no evidence outside the paranoid ramblings
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.240]  of nuts for the New World Order.
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:38.480]  And all the conspiracy theorists can actually agree on as a, as a conspiracy.
[1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:42.000]  It's a good bet that Occam's razor is being used correctly in this instance.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:45.320]  And then there's a talk earlier about how I'm a liar and it's all made up.
[1:42:45.320 --> 1:42:46.480]  There's no New World Order.
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:50.920]  Sir, hundreds of books have been written with the title New World Order calling for world
[1:42:50.920 --> 1:42:51.920]  government.
[1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:56.080]  Hundreds of newspaper articles in the last two months have said, yes, world governments
[1:42:56.080 --> 1:43:00.280]  being set up by the bank, she'll pay a carbon tax to them.
[1:43:00.280 --> 1:43:01.880]  Everything I told you they do.
[1:43:01.880 --> 1:43:04.560]  Everything I told you years ago they would have an economic collapse.
[1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:08.640]  They use terrorism as a pretext to take our freedoms.
[1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:13.440]  And that when they finally brought it to a head, they put troops on the streets of America.
[1:43:13.440 --> 1:43:18.200]  Now how did everything I say come true? Because I was reading the Club of Rome, reading the
[1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:21.840]  CFR, reading the Rand Corporation, public stuff.
[1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:24.760]  Can you imagine what we don't know?
[1:43:24.760 --> 1:43:27.480]  And this guy, this guy just...

[1:45:36.480 --> 1:45:39.400]  Do you have at least a year's supply of food for your family?
[1:45:39.400 --> 1:45:42.440]  This is Kurt, the armchair survivalist, heard on this network.
[1:45:42.440 --> 1:45:46.400]  Survival enterprises sells real food, canned for long-term storage, beef, chicken, turkey,
[1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:50.320]  bacon, butter, cheese, eggs, freeze-dried fruits and vegetables, Mountain House freeze-dried
[1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:55.200]  meals, MREs, a full nutritional line, the British Birkfeld water filter and more.
[1:45:55.200 --> 1:46:03.120]  If you want to prepare now, go to beforeitstoolate.us, that's before itstoolate.us or call 1-800-753-1981,
[1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:08.680]  that's 1-800-753-1981 or you can put your head in the sand and be just another sheeple
[1:46:08.680 --> 1:46:10.240]  in the corporate controlled flock.
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:28.560]  But remember, those who don't learn from history are bound to repeat it.
[1:46:28.560 --> 1:46:32.640]  How would you like to save up to 90% on your phone bill?

[1:47:22.960 --> 1:47:34.480]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:42.160]  Look, for everybody out there who's into dial about world government, private families
[1:47:42.160 --> 1:47:47.480]  that control the central banks that control the brokerage firms, it's just a Ponzi scheme.
[1:47:47.480 --> 1:47:52.360]  It's a scam, but they're so big, their Ponzi schemes don't fail.
[1:47:52.360 --> 1:47:56.520]  They buy off your military, they buy off your governments with the trillions of dollars
[1:47:56.520 --> 1:47:59.200]  they've got, the taxpayers have to pay back later.
[1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:01.760]  That's the little hitch.
[1:48:01.760 --> 1:48:05.400]  And they're just setting up tyranny, and they've been openly bragging about it.
[1:48:05.400 --> 1:48:07.080]  They all need to be arrested.
[1:48:07.080 --> 1:48:12.920]  They're all a bunch of made-offs, but instead they're hailed as our saviors on the news.
[1:48:12.920 --> 1:48:15.640]  Oh, let's cut to this brokerage from head.
[1:48:15.640 --> 1:48:17.800]  He'll tell us how to save the economy.
[1:48:17.800 --> 1:48:21.920]  Well, you give the bankers unlimited power and regulatory power, and we'll fix it.
[1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:25.840]  And they're the ones that did it.
[1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:28.880]  And things are only going to get worse until we turn this around.
[1:48:28.880 --> 1:48:33.180]  And I mean, as for New World Order, you can go to Google News and type in New World Order
[1:48:33.180 --> 1:48:37.480]  and see hundreds of mainstream news articles telling you how great it is and how good it
[1:48:37.480 --> 1:48:38.480]  is.
[1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:40.480]  And then meanwhile, people are telling me it doesn't exist.
[1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:43.720]  Listen, stop sucking your thumbs.
[1:48:43.720 --> 1:48:48.840]  Stop denying world governments here and exist.
[1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:54.320]  All it is is a global consortium, a global corporate takeover of sovereign countries,
[1:48:54.320 --> 1:48:59.400]  and they transfer the nation-state power into illegitimate, unelected boards like the IMF,
[1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:04.520]  the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the International Bank of Settlements.
[1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:07.680]  Grow up.
[1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:11.520]  Good government is small and protects freedom, bad government attacks freedom, and loots
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:12.520]  the public.
[1:49:12.520 --> 1:49:15.840]  I mean, I've got all these articles about all the bureaucrats they're creating and the
[1:49:15.840 --> 1:49:19.560]  way they're harassing landowners and the American people.
[1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:20.960]  And they know you're going to revolt.
[1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:22.960]  They know you're not going along with it.
[1:49:22.960 --> 1:49:26.920]  They're going to make examples out of people, but they're going to end up getting their
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:27.920]  hind ends kicked.
[1:49:27.920 --> 1:49:30.160]  I mean, look at this story here.
[1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:35.160]  All over the U.S. and England, they're putting cameras and microphones in the school bathrooms.
[1:49:35.160 --> 1:49:42.520]  Big brother, CCTV to spy on pupils, age four, complete with CPS, evidence kit.
[1:49:42.520 --> 1:49:49.040]  This is out of the Globe and Mail online, Daily Mail in the U.K., but it admits it's
[1:49:49.040 --> 1:49:50.640]  happening here in the U.S. as well.
[1:49:50.640 --> 1:49:53.960]  It says that it's in the school bathrooms everywhere.
[1:49:53.960 --> 1:49:54.960]  I'm just sick of it.
[1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:57.400]  I mean, they're training your kids how to be prisoners.
[1:49:57.400 --> 1:50:02.720]  The state is trying to make you its property, and I'm sick of it.
[1:50:02.720 --> 1:50:04.880]  Let's talk to Lee in Austin, Texas.
[1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:07.000]  Lee, you're on the air.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  Welcome.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  Hi.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  How are you?
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  Good.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  It's good to hear you.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  Well, I listened to your program, but this is the first time I've called.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  Welcome.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:19.600]  I only have one, actually three statements to make.
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:25.920]  Number one, when is this country going to wake up and read the Constitution, the Declaration
[1:50:25.920 --> 1:50:31.200]  of Independence, and remember where, why, and how we were founded?
[1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:36.240]  Number two, when are we going to learn to read about the people that are elected before
[1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:38.120]  we push the button?
[1:50:38.120 --> 1:50:43.520]  And number three, when are we going to get out the incumbents and actually put people
[1:50:43.520 --> 1:50:47.880]  in that are going to listen to us, that are going to protect our rights, that are going
[1:50:47.880 --> 1:50:53.800]  to keep Big Brother at bay, and really do care about the American people?
[1:50:53.800 --> 1:50:59.280]  Well, you know, 30 years ago, 20 years ago, if the polls show that 90% of people wanted
[1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:02.520]  something and it was constitutional, government wouldn't do it.
[1:51:02.520 --> 1:51:06.040]  Why do you think now 80% went under the war?
[1:51:06.040 --> 1:51:08.960]  The war continues, 91% want to control the borders.
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:09.960]  It doesn't happen.
[1:51:09.960 --> 1:51:13.880]  You know, 80 plus percent want to end the drug war, it continues.
[1:51:13.880 --> 1:51:18.720]  That's happening because of the electronic voting machines that are basically CIA run,
[1:51:18.720 --> 1:51:20.440]  the big four companies.
[1:51:20.440 --> 1:51:22.240]  And so they're heading us off at the pass.
[1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:23.240]  It's called tyranny.
[1:51:23.240 --> 1:51:26.920]  That's why they're moving into the final phase of troops, but go ahead.
[1:51:26.920 --> 1:51:30.920]  Here's the true fact for you.
[1:51:30.920 --> 1:51:37.640]  All these Mexicans, illegal aliens, and other people that are coming into this country,
[1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:42.560]  when we were living in Las Vegas, Nevada, we watched them at a huge rally, state about
[1:51:42.560 --> 1:51:48.000]  how much they wanted to be Americans while they waved huge Mexican flags.
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:53.120]  If you want to be an American, where is your American flag?
[1:51:53.120 --> 1:51:55.920]  I hear you and I appreciate your call, good to hear from you.
[1:51:55.920 --> 1:52:01.520]  Everybody made a big deal about giving poor children Chinese slave made toys that break
[1:52:01.520 --> 1:52:04.120]  in one hour and give them lead poisoning.
[1:52:04.120 --> 1:52:08.440]  How about we give our children a future, liberty, freedom without foreign bankers ruling over
[1:52:08.440 --> 1:52:15.840]  us, freedom, a bill of rights, due process, a constitution, an even playing field is what
[1:52:15.840 --> 1:52:18.000]  our children need.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:19.360]  But they've taken our heroes away.
[1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:22.960]  I mean, I'm not against sports, but those aren't real heroes.
[1:52:22.960 --> 1:52:27.960]  See, they've taken our heroes as well because they don't want a hero to be somebody that
[1:52:27.960 --> 1:52:32.080]  stands up against tyranny or somebody that fights City Hall or Rosa Parks.
[1:52:32.080 --> 1:52:37.080]  They want to make the heroes somebody that hits a ball because that is an issue that
[1:52:37.080 --> 1:52:38.160]  doesn't matter.
[1:52:38.160 --> 1:52:41.440]  So they'll again, they've taken our role models away.
[1:52:41.440 --> 1:52:45.080]  They have done it all and absolutely the US government, the criminals, they are not our
[1:52:45.080 --> 1:52:50.040]  legitimate government for 60 years is paid for textbooks in Mexico, teaching the children
[1:52:50.040 --> 1:52:53.280]  that the US belongs to Mexico and the US is evil.
[1:52:53.280 --> 1:52:58.080]  And then the PR firm that got Bush elected, Rob Allen and co up in Dallas, this was in
[1:52:58.080 --> 1:53:01.960]  the Dallas morning news, by the way, it ran all those illegal alien demonstrations of
[1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:03.320]  two years ago.
[1:53:03.320 --> 1:53:06.440]  That was all White House run by a Republican front group.
[1:53:06.440 --> 1:53:11.520]  Of course, the Democrats are for it too because the globalist want to destroy wages and break
[1:53:11.520 --> 1:53:12.520]  this country down.
[1:53:12.520 --> 1:53:16.320]  So they handed out the American flags to the illegal aliens out of the backs of trucks,
[1:53:16.320 --> 1:53:17.800]  but the illegals didn't want that.
[1:53:17.800 --> 1:53:22.800]  They wanted to weigh their Mexican flags and say Viva la Raza, which means up with a race.
[1:53:22.800 --> 1:53:29.400]  And I know it feels good to all be into your race, you know, and there's and the point
[1:53:29.400 --> 1:53:32.880]  is I've had to transcend that to understand, divide and conquer.
[1:53:32.880 --> 1:53:38.600]  But I'm not going to sit here like a schmuck and play along that la Raza or the race or
[1:53:38.600 --> 1:53:44.400]  all these other grips aren't new world order controlled, Mexico's new order controlled.
[1:53:44.400 --> 1:53:48.040]  It's a narco terror state and I don't blame people wanting to come up here and get a better
[1:53:48.040 --> 1:53:49.040]  life.
[1:53:49.040 --> 1:53:52.720]  But I do blame them buying into new world order propaganda about bringing down the US.
[1:53:52.720 --> 1:53:54.640]  The globalist want to bring the US down.
[1:53:54.640 --> 1:53:56.080]  They're done with the US.
[1:53:56.080 --> 1:53:58.120]  They've used us to build their world government.
[1:53:58.120 --> 1:54:02.040]  Now they're bringing in their world government and they want us to be a third world nation.
[1:54:02.040 --> 1:54:05.320]  The US is being sucked dry by offshore banks.
[1:54:05.320 --> 1:54:07.160]  The globalist want to open borders.
[1:54:07.160 --> 1:54:08.680]  They want to break up our families.
[1:54:08.680 --> 1:54:10.520]  They want to destroy the middle class.
[1:54:10.520 --> 1:54:13.140]  Whether you're Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[1:54:13.140 --> 1:54:18.760]  So anything the globalists are for, anything the CFR is for, you need to be against.
[1:54:18.760 --> 1:54:21.920]  And when they play that mind game of telling you, hey, there's no such thing as a new world
[1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:25.800]  order, you need to get angry at them and say, listen, dirtbag criminal.
[1:54:25.800 --> 1:54:29.280]  I can read the hundreds of government documents and the hundreds of news articles telling
[1:54:29.280 --> 1:54:31.840]  me there's a world government and telling me how good it is.
[1:54:31.840 --> 1:54:37.280]  And then the minute I say, I don't want your world government, you laugh at me and patronize
[1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:40.880]  me patronize me and tell me it doesn't exist.
[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:43.480]  It's a mind game.
[1:54:43.480 --> 1:54:45.080]  What a sick joke.
[1:54:45.080 --> 1:54:47.520]  You people are discredited.
[1:54:47.520 --> 1:54:50.160]  They're still spewing the old propaganda of denying it.
[1:54:50.160 --> 1:54:55.000]  Meanwhile, their bosses are announcing it is here and it is happening.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:56.640]  Let's talk to Kyle and Bastrop.
[1:54:56.640 --> 1:54:58.200]  Kyle, you're on the air.
[1:54:58.200 --> 1:54:59.200]  Welcome.
[1:54:59.200 --> 1:55:00.200]  Welcome.
[1:55:00.200 --> 1:55:01.200]  Welcome.
[1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:05.640]  And, and George Bush, you tried for treason.
[1:55:05.640 --> 1:55:10.800]  George Bush is a mindless, petty, nobody puppet, just like Barack Obama.
[1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:16.640]  He's a front man, so everybody focuses on him while the bankers in the back room financially
[1:55:16.640 --> 1:55:17.640]  rape us.
[1:55:17.640 --> 1:55:24.560]  And when you kill 3,000 people, that's to go to war.
[1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:31.480]  Back in the 40s, Adolf Hitler killed 6 million Jews and we went to war with him.
[1:55:31.480 --> 1:55:34.000]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:35.200]  Hitler killed more than that.
[1:55:35.200 --> 1:55:42.000]  At least 20 million people died during World War II, Jews, Poles, Russians, French, North
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:44.680]  Africans was absolutely horrible.
[1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:49.240]  And again, Hitler was financed by the U.S. It's declassified.
[1:55:49.240 --> 1:55:53.040]  The Milner Group, Mainline British History books teach it.
[1:55:53.040 --> 1:55:56.520]  The British Empire in the U.S. put him in power to wreck Europe.
[1:55:56.520 --> 1:56:00.800]  You know, they set him up knowing what he would do, then told him to take Europe, told
[1:56:00.800 --> 1:56:03.240]  him to attack the Russians and then set him up.
[1:56:03.240 --> 1:56:04.640]  So see, who's more evil?
[1:56:04.640 --> 1:56:07.080]  Hitler or the people that set Hitler up?
[1:56:07.080 --> 1:56:08.080]  Remember that.
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:10.600]  Let's talk to Roger in Georgetown.
[1:56:10.600 --> 1:56:11.600]  You're on the air, Roger.
[1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:12.600]  Hi, Alex.
[1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:13.600]  Good to talk to you, man.
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:14.600]  Good to talk to you.
[1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:18.880]  All of this begs the question, well, what can we do as individuals?
[1:56:18.880 --> 1:56:23.320]  Well, I've got a garden, I'm buying gold and silver coins.
[1:56:23.320 --> 1:56:27.000]  And the lady that before said, well, why don't people read the Constitution?
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:30.800]  Well, I read the part that says, the state shall make no law with respect to private
[1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:31.800]  contracts.
[1:56:31.800 --> 1:56:36.760]  No law applies when you and I agree that I'll do some work for you for X amount of dollars.
[1:56:36.760 --> 1:56:42.840]  So I'm doing that as much as I can and staying out of banks and trying to get away from all
[1:56:42.840 --> 1:56:43.840]  of that.
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:47.040]  Now, if you take the money out from under them, that'll get their attention.
[1:56:47.040 --> 1:56:48.840]  I don't know what else to do.
[1:56:48.840 --> 1:56:53.840]  I mean, you know, everybody says, well, I'm for liberty and then they go get a big loan
[1:56:53.840 --> 1:56:54.840]  from the banks.
[1:56:54.840 --> 1:56:58.760]  Or they whine and cry and say, why would the foreign bankers hurt us?
[1:56:58.760 --> 1:56:59.760]  Don't they care?
[1:56:59.760 --> 1:57:00.760]  Don't they love me?
[1:57:00.760 --> 1:57:03.200]  They're ruthless conquerors.
[1:57:03.200 --> 1:57:10.520]  They're ruthless conquerors that are economically, militarily conquering us with a pincer attack.
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:13.880]  And all this phony environmentalism has nothing to do with the earth.
[1:57:13.880 --> 1:57:14.880]  It's about taxes.
[1:57:14.880 --> 1:57:15.880]  Go ahead.
[1:57:15.880 --> 1:57:19.440]  And they put little commercials on the air that say, well, it's in your wallet.
[1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:20.440]  Well, my money.
[1:57:20.440 --> 1:57:21.440]  Thank you very much.
[1:57:21.440 --> 1:57:22.440]  It's not in your wallet.
[1:57:22.440 --> 1:57:23.440]  It's in mine.
[1:57:23.440 --> 1:57:24.440]  Thanks.
[1:57:24.440 --> 1:57:28.960]  You know, I'm not going to, you know, I just trust in God and I do the best that I can
[1:57:28.960 --> 1:57:31.800]  and I can make a private contract with somebody.
[1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:32.800]  They pay me cash.
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:34.000]  Nobody knows the difference.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:35.120]  Big deal.
[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:36.120]  It's not illegal.
[1:57:36.120 --> 1:57:37.600]  I hear your brother.
[1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:38.600]  Good to hear from you.
[1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:39.600]  I got to jump.
[1:57:39.600 --> 1:57:42.520]  This is the end of the transmission.

[1:58:57.440 --> 1:58:58.940]  It is private.
[1:58:58.940 --> 1:58:59.940]  It owes no one.
