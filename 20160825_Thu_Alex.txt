[00:00.000 --> 00:08.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday, the 25th day of August 2016.
[00:08.600 --> 00:13.320]  This is going to be an over-the-top, important jam-packed transmission.
[00:13.320 --> 00:15.800]  But first, a key report with John Bowne.
[00:15.800 --> 00:23.600]  Racists go home, racists go home, and the name-calling blares on with nothing to back
[00:23.600 --> 00:24.600]  it up.
[00:24.600 --> 00:29.720]  Well, Trump haters, have you put much research or even logical thought into your claims of
[00:29.720 --> 00:32.160]  Donald Trump's supposed xenophobia?
[00:32.160 --> 00:37.240]  I know it's a big word and it's fun to use, but why is it that Trump made this statement
[00:37.240 --> 00:38.600]  in the first place?
[00:38.600 --> 00:43.040]  When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.
[00:43.040 --> 00:48.920]  They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume,
[00:48.920 --> 00:50.120]  are good people.
[00:50.120 --> 00:54.080]  But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting.
[00:54.080 --> 00:56.360]  And it only makes common sense.
[00:56.360 --> 00:58.880]  It only makes common sense.
[00:58.880 --> 01:00.960]  It's not sending us not the right people.
[01:00.960 --> 01:03.720]  It's coming from more than Mexico.
[01:03.720 --> 01:10.040]  It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably, probably,
[01:10.040 --> 01:11.560]  from the Middle East.
[01:11.560 --> 01:13.560]  Could this have something to do with it?
[01:13.560 --> 01:18.880]  Last year, the Washington Times reported that more than 100 immigrants whom the Obama administration
[01:18.880 --> 01:24.080]  released back into the community went on to be charged with subsequent killings.
[01:24.080 --> 01:31.760]  In 2015 alone, over 30,000 illegals from countries of terrorist concern crossed the United States
[01:31.760 --> 01:33.400]  southwestern border.
[01:33.400 --> 01:35.320]  That was last year, clowns.
[01:35.320 --> 01:40.240]  Do you actually think denying those facts as they get buried by the dying lamestream
[01:40.240 --> 01:42.000]  media solves the problem?
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.520]  You're going to take this and probably spin it, right?
[01:44.520 --> 01:51.040]  As many as 20 Americans are killed by unlicensed drivers per day, the bulk of which are drivers
[01:51.040 --> 01:53.480]  in the United States illegally.
[01:53.480 --> 01:58.440]  Most of these manslaughter cases barely see any jail time because of their illegal immigration
[01:58.440 --> 01:59.440]  status.
[01:59.440 --> 02:05.320]  As I started to testify, Sacramento, Los Angeles Police Commission, all I was hearing
[02:05.320 --> 02:10.320]  was, well, you know, these people work, they contribute, they have to take their kids to
[02:10.320 --> 02:11.320]  school.
[02:11.320 --> 02:14.720]  Like, that was a reason that it was okay that they killed people.
[02:14.720 --> 02:20.360]  And every year, just driving, they kill about 3,000 people, which of course never makes
[02:20.360 --> 02:22.840]  it in the press anywhere.
[02:22.840 --> 02:29.880]  These newspapers now don't even give the license or immigration status when they kill somebody.
[02:29.880 --> 02:31.440]  All Mexicans rapists.
[02:31.440 --> 02:32.440]  Wrong.
[02:32.440 --> 02:33.440]  No, he has.
[02:33.440 --> 02:34.440]  Wrong.
[02:34.440 --> 02:35.440]  Someone have a...
[02:35.440 --> 02:36.440]  Someone pull it up.
[02:36.440 --> 02:37.440]  I don't know.
[02:37.440 --> 02:41.640]  How dare Donald Trump refer to illegal aliens as rapists, right?
[02:41.640 --> 02:42.640]  Wrong.
[02:42.640 --> 02:49.000]  Just last month, the website, ncfire.info, short for North Carolinians for Immigration
[02:49.000 --> 02:55.520]  Reform and Enforcement, a website that simply tallies North Carolina child rape crimes reported
[02:55.520 --> 03:03.960]  that in July of 2016, last month, 117 innocent North Carolina children were sexually abused
[03:03.960 --> 03:05.320]  by these guys.
[03:05.320 --> 03:08.920]  The same guys the anti-Truppers claimed don't exist.
[03:08.920 --> 03:17.240]  In December of 2013, 89 illegals committed 575 acts of sexual abuse on American children
[03:17.240 --> 03:21.600]  in one month alone if North Carolina serves as the bellwether.
[03:21.600 --> 03:25.760]  Can you imagine what's happening in states like California and Texas?
[03:25.760 --> 03:30.920]  And now, as the Washington Free Beacon reported, SUNY extremists are infiltrating the United
[03:30.920 --> 03:36.440]  States with the help of alien smugglers in South America and are crossing U.S. borders
[03:36.440 --> 03:41.040]  with ease, according to a U.S. South Command intelligence report.
[03:41.040 --> 03:46.360]  The command's J2 intelligence directorate reported recently in internal channels that
[03:46.360 --> 03:52.640]  special interest aliens are working with a known alien smuggler network in Latin America
[03:52.640 --> 03:54.760]  to reach the United States.
[03:54.760 --> 04:01.360]  If you superimpose these facts on the anti-Trump protesters' concerns, at the end of the day,
[04:01.360 --> 04:04.760]  it's nothing less than a display of treason.
[04:04.760 --> 04:09.720]  Treason fueled by disinformation, insulting the memory of defenseless Americans killed
[04:09.720 --> 04:16.680]  and or raped by the very illegal aliens, these delusional leftists continue to defend.
[04:16.680 --> 04:22.840]  But all of that horror aside anti-Trump protesters, you just keep on ignoring the mushrooming
[04:22.840 --> 04:26.120]  epidemic of unreported child rapes by illegals.
[04:26.120 --> 04:31.640]  The unwarranted deaths of your fellow citizens and the coming jihad that will eventually
[04:31.640 --> 04:38.520]  claim you or someone you know if the real Americans protecting your hide don't do something
[04:38.520 --> 04:39.800]  about it.
[04:39.800 --> 04:44.560]  Because the rest of us are working towards a day when you will have to answer to your
[04:44.560 --> 04:45.560]  ignorance.
[04:45.560 --> 04:49.800]  I'm a senior citizen and I don't believe in dirty, filthy, lying politicians.
[04:49.800 --> 04:50.800]  Okay, so who are you going to vote for?
[04:50.800 --> 04:51.800]  Can I ask you who you're going to vote for?
[04:51.800 --> 04:52.800]  You can count on it.
[04:52.800 --> 04:53.800]  And I'm voting for Hillary Clinton.
[04:53.800 --> 04:54.800]  Hold on, folks.
[04:54.800 --> 04:59.360]  She just said she's against lying corrupt politicians, but she's voting for Hillary
[04:59.360 --> 05:00.360]  Clinton.
[05:00.360 --> 05:02.240]  John Bowne for Enforce.com.
[05:02.240 --> 05:05.880]  Hillary Clinton had lined the Jimmy Kimmel Show this week, playing to the camera, opening
[05:05.880 --> 05:08.760]  pickle jars, laughter and all smiles.
[05:08.760 --> 05:09.760]  Relatability, right?
[05:09.760 --> 05:14.320]  Well, would it shock you to know that if TV ratings are any indication, voters were more
[05:14.320 --> 05:19.920]  interested in watching Robot Chicken and Teen Mom Season 6 rather than Hillary Clinton?
[05:19.920 --> 05:20.920]  Low ratings.
[05:20.920 --> 05:22.960]  Hey, what difference does it make, right?
[05:22.960 --> 05:27.240]  Now, Donald Trump, meanwhile, was a smash hit in Austin, Texas, breaking a record for
[05:27.240 --> 05:28.240]  rally attendees.
[05:28.240 --> 05:32.360]  Some have reported 10,000 through the door, as many as 2,000 turned away because of no
[05:32.360 --> 05:33.360]  seats.
[05:33.360 --> 05:37.560]  The most common theme in his appearances across the country, meanwhile, Clinton, who's also
[05:37.560 --> 05:40.560]  campaigning, has little turnout, unable to fill seats.
[05:40.560 --> 05:44.880]  But Hillary somehow comes out ahead in every poll with the exception of just a few.
[05:44.880 --> 05:46.680]  Now, that makes sense, doesn't it?
[05:46.680 --> 05:50.760]  If the mainstream media polls are any indication, one would think that Hillary has a major lead
[05:50.760 --> 05:51.760]  over Trump.
[05:51.760 --> 05:55.600]  However, if last night's TV ratings were in, you'd think that Americans would rather
[05:55.600 --> 05:58.240]  watch Paint Dry than hear her tell a joke.
[05:58.240 --> 06:02.360]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for Infowars.com.
[06:02.360 --> 06:06.560]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from InfowarsLife.com.
[06:06.560 --> 06:10.560]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful
[06:10.560 --> 06:14.040]  and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[06:14.040 --> 06:19.440]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at InfowarsLife.com is loaded with a full
[06:19.440 --> 06:24.680]  month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely
[06:24.680 --> 06:25.680]  needs.
[06:25.680 --> 06:29.920]  In the history of Infowars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival
[06:29.920 --> 06:33.360]  Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[06:33.360 --> 06:38.240]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery
[06:38.240 --> 06:43.000]  system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.360]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[06:47.360 --> 06:52.800]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest
[06:52.800 --> 06:54.560]  quality lab standard.
[06:54.560 --> 06:56.000]  That means it's clean.
[06:56.000 --> 06:57.000]  That means it's pure.
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.080]  That's InfowarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[07:00.080 --> 07:02.240]  Take action now before we sell out.
[07:02.240 --> 07:06.640]  More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research into what has been
[07:06.640 --> 07:08.240]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[07:08.240 --> 07:12.760]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[07:12.760 --> 07:17.960]  devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[07:17.960 --> 07:21.680]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[07:21.680 --> 07:25.400]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[07:25.400 --> 07:29.920]  So when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[07:29.920 --> 07:32.360]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[07:32.360 --> 07:37.800]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[07:37.800 --> 07:43.600]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[07:43.600 --> 07:45.200]  ever concerning iodine.
[07:45.200 --> 07:47.160]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[07:47.160 --> 07:51.400]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[07:51.400 --> 07:53.640]  any optimum health regimen.
[07:53.640 --> 08:03.160]  Look up on Survival Shield X2 Today at InfowarsLife.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[08:03.160 --> 08:10.680]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:10.680 --> 08:30.160]  Thank you for joining us on this live, original Thursday, the 25th day of August, 2016, Worldwide
[08:30.160 --> 08:31.160]  broadcast.
[08:31.160 --> 08:32.160]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[08:32.160 --> 08:35.440]  We're going to be here for the next four hours today.
[08:35.440 --> 08:41.240]  Investigative journalist John Rappaport will be joining us to look at the ongoing emails
[08:41.240 --> 08:48.640]  that are coming out, showing that the Clinton Foundation was indeed a pay-to-play, money-laundering
[08:48.640 --> 08:54.760]  operation so that the Secretary of State could sell out the United States to the highest
[08:54.760 --> 08:55.760]  bidder.
[08:55.760 --> 08:57.000]  And, of course, the American worker.
[08:57.000 --> 09:04.280]  Most of it is deals to allow the export of our technology, our minerals, you name it,
[09:04.280 --> 09:10.480]  to multinationals, truly incredible.
[09:10.480 --> 09:18.880]  We also have an amazing clip of Nigel Farage in Louisiana with Donald Trump yesterday that
[09:18.880 --> 09:24.360]  before I even get into all the news, I want to play in whole right now because I think
[09:24.360 --> 09:30.560]  it's important to kick the show off with Nigel Farage, the man that founded UKIP 24 years
[09:30.560 --> 09:37.160]  ago and who has taken the InfoWard to Europe and has gotten the British to successfully
[09:37.160 --> 09:40.120]  go with the Brexit.
[09:40.120 --> 09:44.160]  So let's go ahead and go to that report if you're a radio listener and want to actually
[09:44.160 --> 09:45.160]  see the video.
[09:45.160 --> 09:51.160]  It's on InfoWards.com and PrisonPlanet.com and an article by Paul Joseph Watson, also
[09:51.160 --> 09:55.840]  obviously important to share this video, so we're going to be getting into that.
[09:55.840 --> 10:01.080]  We're also going to be looking at a Sange New Hillary Info could swing election if it
[10:01.080 --> 10:02.640]  catches fire.
[10:02.640 --> 10:13.440]  But first, Nigel Farage, the InfoWarrier of Albion, being introduced by Donald J. Trump.
[10:13.440 --> 10:22.800]  Well, thank you and good evening, Mississippi.
[10:22.800 --> 10:28.280]  I come to you from the United Kingdom with a message of hope and a message of optimism.
[10:28.280 --> 10:33.440]  It's a message that says if the little people, if the real people, if the ordinary decent
[10:33.440 --> 10:39.280]  people are prepared to stand up and fight for what they believe in, we can overcome the
[10:39.280 --> 10:40.280]  big banks.
[10:40.280 --> 10:47.560]  We can overcome the multinational.
[10:47.560 --> 10:55.200]  And we did it, we made June the 23rd our Independence Day when we smashed the establishment.
[10:55.200 --> 11:01.440]  And we did it.
[11:01.440 --> 11:03.360]  Everybody said we'd lose.
[11:03.360 --> 11:04.360]  And what did we see?
[11:04.360 --> 11:06.840]  We saw experts from all over the world.
[11:06.840 --> 11:12.600]  We saw the International Monetary Fund, we saw Moody's, we saw Standard and Pause, we
[11:12.600 --> 11:21.280]  saw global leaders giving us project fear, telling us that if we voted not to be run
[11:21.280 --> 11:29.720]  by a bunch of unelected old men in Brussels, yeah, well, it's okay, they don't like me
[11:29.720 --> 11:38.080]  either, so it doesn't really matter, does it?
[11:38.080 --> 11:41.360]  But they told us our economy would fall off a cliff.
[11:41.360 --> 11:46.360]  They told us there'd be mass unemployment, they told us investment would leave our country.
[11:46.360 --> 11:54.960]  And David Cameron, then our Prime Minister, but no longer, told us we might even get World
[11:54.960 --> 12:01.800]  War III, and we saw the commentary at, and we saw the polling industry doing everything
[12:01.800 --> 12:04.840]  they could to demoralize our campaign.
[12:04.840 --> 12:12.320]  On the day of the vote itself, that morning, they put us 10 points behind, and actually
[12:12.320 --> 12:13.320]  they were all wrong.
[12:13.320 --> 12:18.880]  And they were wrong because what the Brexit campaign did is we reach those people who've
[12:18.880 --> 12:22.840]  been let down by modern global corporatism.
[12:22.840 --> 12:31.040]  We reach those people.
[12:31.040 --> 12:36.600]  We reach those people who have never voted in their lives, but believed by going out
[12:36.600 --> 12:41.320]  and voting for Brexit, they could take back control of their country, take back control
[12:41.320 --> 12:53.080]  of their borders, and get back their pride and self-respect.
[12:53.080 --> 12:59.200]  Now the big card, the big card the Prime Minister decided to play in the referendum is he got
[12:59.200 --> 13:02.920]  a foreign visitor to come to London to talk to us.
[13:02.920 --> 13:16.320]  Yes, we were visited by one Barack Obama.
[13:16.320 --> 13:22.200]  And he talked down to us, he treated us as if we were nothing, one of the oldest functioning
[13:22.200 --> 13:26.840]  democracies in the world, and here he was telling us to vote remain.
[13:26.840 --> 13:35.600]  So I, having criticized, having criticized and condemned his behavior, I could not possibly
[13:35.600 --> 13:51.240]  tell you how you should vote in this election, but, but, you know I get it, I get it, I get
[13:51.240 --> 13:54.240]  it, I get it, I'm hearing you.
[13:54.240 --> 13:59.520]  But I will say this, if I was an American citizen, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton
[13:59.520 --> 14:08.920]  if you paid me.
[14:08.920 --> 14:15.760]  In fact, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if she paid me.
[14:15.760 --> 14:24.000]  Folks, the message is clear, the parallels are there, there are millions of ordinary Americans
[14:24.000 --> 14:29.200]  who have been let down, who have had a bad time, who feel the political class in Washington
[14:29.200 --> 14:34.600]  are detached from them, who feel so many of their representatives are politically correct
[14:34.600 --> 14:40.840]  parts of that liberal media elite, they feel people aren't standing up for them, and they
[14:40.840 --> 14:45.120]  have actually in many cases given up on the whole electoral process.
[14:45.120 --> 14:51.560]  And I think, I think that you have a fantastic opportunity here with this campaign, you can
[14:51.560 --> 14:52.560]  go out.
[14:52.560 --> 15:04.160]  You can beat the pollsters, you can beat the commentators, you can beat Washington.
[15:04.160 --> 15:08.800]  And you'll do it by doing what we did for Brexit in Britain.
[15:08.800 --> 15:14.840]  We had our own People's Army of ordinary citizens who went out and delivered leaflets, who went
[15:14.840 --> 15:19.280]  to meet people where they worked and where they socialized, who convinced and inspired
[15:19.280 --> 15:26.000]  people to go out if this was the one and only time in their life, and to vote for change.
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.760]  So my advice to you, if you want change in this country, you better get your walking
[15:31.760 --> 15:43.360]  boots on, you better get out there campaigning, and remember, and remember, anything is possible
[15:43.360 --> 15:48.760]  if enough decent people are prepared to stand up against the establishment.
[15:48.760 --> 15:58.200]  Thank you very much indeed.
[15:58.200 --> 16:02.360]  Wow.
[16:02.360 --> 16:06.960]  Thank you guys, you're what a job.
[16:06.960 --> 16:18.080]  Now I raise this point so that you the listeners understand the real playing field we're on.
[16:18.080 --> 16:22.080]  The globalists operate in hoaxes and in fraud,
[16:22.080 --> 16:25.360]  but many times if their hoax is successful
[16:25.360 --> 16:27.240]  and the public buys into the lie,
[16:27.240 --> 16:30.000]  it then becomes manifest reality.
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.180]  When we're submitting to their brainwashing,
[16:34.040 --> 16:38.920]  humans are basically able to build and create
[16:38.920 --> 16:40.400]  whatever we envision.
[16:40.400 --> 16:41.320]  We've proven that.
[16:41.320 --> 16:47.360]  And so they come out and they create the perception
[16:48.520 --> 16:50.320]  that Trump is a racist when he's not.
[16:50.320 --> 16:52.160]  They create the perception
[16:54.960 --> 16:58.440]  that Trump is 15 points behind the polls when he's not.
[16:59.360 --> 17:02.800]  But then people start talking in the streets,
[17:02.800 --> 17:05.720]  even though they know the mainstream media is deceptive,
[17:05.720 --> 17:09.040]  even though they only trust the media 6% of the time
[17:09.040 --> 17:12.400]  when they're asked in scientific polls.
[17:15.480 --> 17:20.320]  But still, everyone starts parroting the talking point
[17:20.320 --> 17:22.960]  and then it creates a reality.
[17:27.320 --> 17:31.080]  And so how do you reach out to people who are being conned,
[17:31.080 --> 17:34.520]  who are being basically pushed onto a bandwagon?
[17:34.520 --> 17:39.000]  You have to explain to them how this phenomenon works,
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  first they put out the fake polls,
[17:42.200 --> 17:45.440]  then it will skew people somewhat historically
[17:45.440 --> 17:47.760]  towards that number, not all the way.
[17:47.760 --> 17:49.880]  A lot of people aren't weak-minded,
[17:49.880 --> 17:51.720]  but still enough to win the election.
[17:52.680 --> 17:55.160]  But the mainstream media is so discredited now,
[17:55.160 --> 17:57.720]  it's out of gas in many respects,
[17:57.720 --> 18:00.480]  and we are still, how many days is it to the election?
[18:00.480 --> 18:05.480]  74 days, till the November election.
[18:12.880 --> 18:15.000]  A referendum against the corrupt press,
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.160]  a referendum against the corrupt mega banks,
[18:18.160 --> 18:22.000]  but you're not gonna hear Nigel Farage anywhere
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.240]  on international television or national television.
[18:26.920 --> 18:28.400]  They're just blacking it out.
[18:28.400 --> 18:32.200]  Just like they're blacking out the fact
[18:33.400 --> 18:37.280]  that our reporters, two plus miles,
[18:38.240 --> 18:41.560]  getting there three hours before the rally started
[18:41.560 --> 18:44.320]  in North Austin, a supposed blue city,
[18:45.880 --> 18:47.760]  in a sea of red Texas.
[18:50.080 --> 18:52.240]  And we have the video, we have the B-roll,
[18:52.240 --> 18:54.840]  we're gonna roll, I guess now or later,
[18:54.840 --> 18:58.080]  that just shows our reporters
[18:58.080 --> 19:03.080]  having to walk in miles and miles of major highways.
[19:05.280 --> 19:07.440]  They picked a convention center, not downtown,
[19:07.440 --> 19:11.440]  that was smart, but one in North Austin
[19:11.440 --> 19:13.360]  surrounded by cow pastures.
[19:17.320 --> 19:19.680]  Back when I was in high school, it was all cow pastures.
[19:19.680 --> 19:20.960]  Now there's some car dealerships
[19:20.960 --> 19:24.680]  and a few factories and things out there.
[19:24.680 --> 19:29.680]  But had to walk two miles in the 95 degree heat
[19:31.640 --> 19:34.400]  and then there were lines so long overfilled
[19:34.400 --> 19:38.120]  in the convention center, what seeks 20,000 people,
[19:38.120 --> 19:43.120]  that our reporters couldn't even get in,
[19:43.760 --> 19:45.280]  even though they had press passes,
[19:45.280 --> 19:48.080]  they just couldn't even get up there.
[19:48.080 --> 19:50.800]  And that was getting there, some reporters two hours,
[19:50.800 --> 19:55.120]  some reporters three hours before, you would think
[19:55.120 --> 19:58.240]  that'd be huge news with a news chopper over showing it,
[19:58.240 --> 20:01.040]  but they didn't, this is emblematic of the deception.
[20:02.240 --> 20:03.800]  There is an affordable alternative
[20:03.800 --> 20:06.160]  to the high cost of healthcare that offers freedom
[20:06.160 --> 20:08.200]  from insurance while providing compliance
[20:08.200 --> 20:10.320]  with the Obamacare individual mandate.
[20:10.320 --> 20:13.280]  Imagine having access to quality, affordable healthcare
[20:13.280 --> 20:15.560]  that allows you the freedom to choose your doctor
[20:15.560 --> 20:16.560]  and hospital.
[20:16.560 --> 20:19.240]  Members can share up to 100% of necessary
[20:19.240 --> 20:22.200]  medical expenses, including some alternative treatments.
[20:22.200 --> 20:25.520]  Find out how you and your family can contain healthcare costs
[20:25.520 --> 20:27.120]  without giving up your freedom.
[20:27.120 --> 20:50.120]  Go to libertyoncall.org, that's libertyoncall.org.
[20:57.520 --> 21:04.000]  There's nothing convenient about shaving,
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.640]  overpaying for razors, running out of shaving gel,
[21:06.640 --> 21:09.680]  using old blades because you forgot to pick up new ones.
[21:09.680 --> 21:10.880]  That's gonna hurt.
[21:10.880 --> 21:14.320]  The nicks, the burns, but now all that's changed
[21:14.320 --> 21:16.000]  because now there's Harry's.
[21:16.000 --> 21:17.760]  Harry's makes shaving better.

[21:19.360 --> 21:21.200]  No more shaving with old blades,
[21:21.200 --> 21:22.600]  running out of lotions and gels,
[21:22.600 --> 21:24.760]  or paying an arm and a leg for blades.

[21:47.120 --> 21:49.480]  also free, just pay a minimal shipping charge.

[22:01.240 --> 22:02.320]  Think about this.
[22:02.320 --> 22:04.720]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems
[22:04.720 --> 22:06.560]  are very likely to be contaminated
[22:06.560 --> 22:08.240]  with heavy metals like lead,
[22:08.240 --> 22:10.680]  disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine,
[22:10.680 --> 22:13.280]  and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins,
[22:13.280 --> 22:14.880]  pain meds, and antidepressants.
[22:14.880 --> 22:17.040]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped
[22:17.040 --> 22:19.160]  to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[24:18.960 --> 24:20.560]  Welcome back, I'm Alan Scheldner.
[24:20.560 --> 24:21.880]  Thank you for joining us.
[24:21.880 --> 24:25.600]  So the corporate media, the establishment media,
[24:25.600 --> 24:26.840]  the discredited media,
[24:29.920 --> 24:30.760]  they're like the devil.
[24:30.760 --> 24:33.600]  They have to have many names to describe them.
[24:33.600 --> 24:35.440]  One is not enough.
[24:35.440 --> 24:40.120]  The enemy media is engaged now in a tripling down
[24:40.120 --> 24:41.960]  that Donald Trump is a bigot and a racist.
[24:41.960 --> 24:43.080]  That's what Hillary's been saying.
[24:43.080 --> 24:45.920]  I'm gonna do a very special live report,
[24:45.920 --> 24:47.800]  disproving all of this when we come back
[24:47.800 --> 24:51.360]  and start the next segment, it's going to be powerful.
[24:52.680 --> 24:54.200]  This segment is too short,
[24:54.200 --> 24:55.680]  but coming up in the next segment,
[24:55.680 --> 25:00.680]  I'm going to destroy the liar Hillary Clinton
[25:02.560 --> 25:07.240]  and her cohorts in the corporate state-run media.
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.200]  We have her and quite frankly,
[25:12.200 --> 25:15.760]  I'm gonna produce with my crew some informational pieces.
[25:15.760 --> 25:17.160]  I wouldn't call them campaign ads,
[25:17.160 --> 25:20.080]  but just ads in defense of truth
[25:21.840 --> 25:23.240]  that we're gonna be putting out
[25:25.320 --> 25:26.960]  that are going to expose what's really going on.
[25:26.960 --> 25:29.080]  I mean, we have Hillary on tape saying
[25:29.080 --> 25:32.000]  black people are super predators that must be brought to heel.
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.040]  It's not just a quote, we have video.
[25:34.920 --> 25:36.800]  We have her saying build a wall.
[25:36.800 --> 25:39.000]  We have Bill Clinton saying build a wall.
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.560]  Now saying black people are super predators
[25:41.560 --> 25:44.600]  instead of saying black criminals are super predators
[25:44.600 --> 25:46.720]  and white criminals are super predators
[25:46.720 --> 25:49.040]  because that's what a Jeffrey Dahmer is.
[25:52.240 --> 25:55.800]  Or Mike Tyson biting Evander Holyfield's ears off.
[25:56.960 --> 25:59.440]  That's a super predator who can't control himself.
[25:59.440 --> 26:00.640]  Evander Holyfield can.
[26:01.560 --> 26:05.880]  See, it's so incredible I can hardly even cover it
[26:05.880 --> 26:07.360]  because there's too much proof, too many facts.
[26:07.360 --> 26:09.320]  It's just crazy.
[26:09.320 --> 26:10.640]  It's crazy.
[26:13.080 --> 26:14.600]  And then they just come out and say
[26:14.600 --> 26:17.640]  he's this horrible racist, he's this horrible evil guy.
[26:17.640 --> 26:19.600]  When she's saying build a wall,
[26:21.120 --> 26:23.600]  that idea came from the Democrats
[26:23.600 --> 26:25.400]  because other countries have them too.
[26:27.680 --> 26:31.080]  But it's the hypocrisy of the media not calling her on this.
[26:31.080 --> 26:34.040]  It's like when Hillary wouldn't go visit
[26:34.040 --> 26:36.280]  flooded Louisiana worse than Katrina.
[26:36.280 --> 26:38.120]  And the media said, that's okay, she's a Democrat,
[26:38.120 --> 26:38.960]  she's a woman.
[26:40.440 --> 26:42.680]  She's not John McCain in 2008.
[26:42.680 --> 26:44.160]  They made that a huge campaign issue
[26:44.160 --> 26:47.280]  that Bush fumbled the Katrina aid.
[26:47.280 --> 26:50.560]  Well, fumbling something is at least on the field,
[26:50.560 --> 26:54.000]  not just refusing to show up, but I'm digressing.
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.800]  This is all coming up at the start of the next segment.
[26:55.800 --> 26:57.400]  It's very, very important.
[26:58.760 --> 27:00.800]  We have all this other news.
[27:00.800 --> 27:02.880]  I used to read unideer documents,
[27:02.880 --> 27:04.840]  UN documents, public statements they put out
[27:04.840 --> 27:07.200]  and people wouldn't believe it 20 years ago.
[27:08.120 --> 27:12.200]  Now every day there are scores of articles
[27:12.200 --> 27:15.720]  where the United Nations says do this or do that
[27:15.720 --> 27:18.800]  with your courts, with your border, with your laws,
[27:18.800 --> 27:21.880]  with your police, with your schools, with your colleges,
[27:21.880 --> 27:23.040]  with your sports teams.
[27:23.040 --> 27:27.320]  We are regularly more and more run by the unelected UN.
[27:28.520 --> 27:30.120]  There's a new article by investigative journalist
[27:30.120 --> 27:33.680]  Wayne Madsen, International Policing Protocol.
[27:33.680 --> 27:34.920]  Now remember a few years ago,
[27:34.920 --> 27:37.800]  we've had whistleblowers on from Homeland Security.
[27:37.800 --> 27:40.320]  They were told, you're not even allowed to say Islamic
[27:40.320 --> 27:43.440]  or Islamic terror when you're investigating someone,
[27:43.440 --> 27:46.600]  even if they've committed a violent act.
[27:46.600 --> 27:48.520]  When you're interrogating somebody that stabs people
[27:48.520 --> 27:50.480]  or shoots people yelling Allah Akbar,
[27:50.480 --> 27:51.920]  you can't even say it's Islamic.
[27:51.920 --> 27:53.360]  Those words aren't allowed.
[27:53.360 --> 27:56.440]  Now this is being put into use internationally.
[27:58.640 --> 28:00.600]  And it's through the UN through Interpol.
[28:00.600 --> 28:05.600]  See, the UN, just like the UN sending 10 fold the monitors,
[28:05.860 --> 28:08.240]  they sent four years ago to the US.
[28:08.240 --> 28:11.840]  Just like the UN and others have been suing Sheriff Arpaio
[28:11.840 --> 28:15.320]  and running around and setting up strong cities initiatives
[28:15.320 --> 28:17.360]  with Justice Department backing.
[28:18.360 --> 28:21.360]  And Obama says, I don't even need Congress
[28:21.360 --> 28:25.320]  or the military or anybody for authority of war.
[28:25.320 --> 28:26.840]  I get it from NATO.
[28:28.720 --> 28:31.200]  We're in a treaty with those other countries
[28:31.200 --> 28:33.000]  for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.120]  for a mutual defense pact.
[28:35.120 --> 28:39.600]  The other countries don't supersede us in that agreement.
[28:39.600 --> 28:42.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a tourism.
[28:42.880 --> 28:45.520]  This is a globalist takeover allied
[28:45.520 --> 28:46.880]  with third world populations.
[28:46.880 --> 28:48.040]  The third world populations,
[28:48.040 --> 28:50.480]  I don't blame them on a better life.
[28:50.480 --> 28:53.840]  The point is they're being used, period,
[28:53.840 --> 28:56.720]  in a seditious move to overthrow this country.
[28:56.720 --> 29:00.440]  It's not like they're overthrowing something
[29:00.440 --> 29:02.280]  to make it better, they're overthrowing it
[29:02.280 --> 29:05.640]  to make us be a captured third world system
[29:05.640 --> 29:09.080]  with a permanent ruling class, the end of the middle class.
[29:09.080 --> 29:11.280]  This is what the New World Order prefers.
[29:11.280 --> 29:12.960]  It's what Obama's pushed.
[29:12.960 --> 29:15.080]  You go to Whole Foods, there's magazines everywhere
[29:15.080 --> 29:16.400]  for like five years.
[29:16.400 --> 29:19.720]  How to be austere, how great it is to be poor.
[29:19.720 --> 29:22.240]  They're, oh great, you wanna be poor?
[29:22.240 --> 29:23.160]  You go ahead.
[29:24.200 --> 29:27.760]  I'm into prosperity and technology and innovation
[29:27.760 --> 29:30.920]  and integrating it with old world classic values.
[29:30.920 --> 29:32.800]  Rugged individualism.
[29:32.800 --> 29:34.680]  But here's the deal.
[29:34.680 --> 29:37.080]  You're not gonna give China energy three times cheaper
[29:37.080 --> 29:40.080]  than us and screw over everybody in America.
[29:40.080 --> 29:41.440]  There are people that do care
[29:41.440 --> 29:43.240]  and they have a right to stand up for them
[29:43.240 --> 29:45.680]  and I'm doing it and you're doing it
[29:45.680 --> 29:47.560]  and nothing on earth's gonna stop us.
[29:47.560 --> 29:51.280]  You can feel the Titan Giant rising.
[29:51.280 --> 29:55.160]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:55.160 --> 30:02.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:25.160 --> 30:32.160]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[30:55.160 --> 30:57.040]  Here are these news stories with friends and family
[30:57.040 --> 30:59.160]  before the Clinton Foundation deletes them.
[30:59.160 --> 31:02.160]  This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com.
[31:02.160 --> 31:04.320]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[31:04.320 --> 31:05.520]  Try a bottle of it.
[31:05.520 --> 31:07.200]  Rob Doe joins us.
[31:07.200 --> 31:10.280]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[31:10.280 --> 31:11.280]  Tell us what brainforce did.
[31:11.280 --> 31:12.280]  I've been working all day.
[31:12.280 --> 31:14.640]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[31:14.640 --> 31:16.640]  I get in here at 8.30.
[31:16.640 --> 31:18.120]  I was kinda run down.
[31:18.120 --> 31:19.880]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it
[31:19.880 --> 31:22.200]  and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[31:22.200 --> 31:23.720]  I got my bottle of brainforce right there.
[31:23.720 --> 31:26.040]  Popped two of them and about 20 minutes later,
[31:26.040 --> 31:29.040]  it's like bing, everything just kinda clears up.
[31:29.040 --> 31:30.440]  Got four and a half stars.
[31:30.440 --> 31:31.720]  People really love it.
[31:31.720 --> 31:33.200]  Read about it, find out why.
[31:33.200 --> 31:36.200]  Third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[31:36.200 --> 31:39.720]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems
[31:39.720 --> 31:41.680]  that will blow your socks off.
[31:41.680 --> 31:43.200]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[31:43.200 --> 31:45.720]  but I probably could not have done it without brainforce.
[31:45.720 --> 31:48.120]  I went home about 6.45 this morning,
[31:48.120 --> 31:49.840]  took three hours of sleep, got up,
[31:49.840 --> 31:51.880]  took two more brainforce and came in.
[31:51.880 --> 31:55.440]  You will find brainforce and other game-changing products
[31:55.440 --> 32:00.440]  at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[32:02.160 --> 32:04.880]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements
[32:04.880 --> 32:07.240]  in the field of science and nutraceuticals.
[32:07.240 --> 32:10.360]  Young Jevity integrates years of scientific research

[32:54.600 --> 32:56.720]  and tell me how Young Jevity and the products
[32:56.720 --> 32:59.160]  at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[32:59.160 --> 33:00.800]  Check it out for yourself today.
[33:04.280 --> 33:06.840]  Waging War on Corruption.
[33:06.840 --> 33:09.720]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[33:09.720 --> 33:20.720]  from the front lines of the Info War.
[33:20.720 --> 33:43.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Escape from the New World Order.
[33:43.720 --> 33:44.960]  If you're a radio listener, you'll
[33:44.960 --> 33:47.240]  want to go to drudzreport.com.
[33:47.240 --> 33:52.840]  Sick Hillary plays clan card on Trump.
[33:52.840 --> 33:54.720]  Totally discredited.
[33:54.720 --> 34:02.280]  He had criticized the KKK of his own accord decades ago,
[34:02.280 --> 34:05.880]  and again, 10 years ago, shingling out David Duke
[34:05.880 --> 34:08.440]  specifically.
[34:08.440 --> 34:11.760]  But that doesn't matter.
[34:11.760 --> 34:14.120]  It doesn't matter that she was actually part of the Dixie
[34:14.120 --> 34:17.800]  mafia and had the KKK actually give money
[34:17.800 --> 34:19.320]  to help her run for office.
[34:19.320 --> 34:24.280]  It doesn't matter if her main mentor was Robert Byrd,
[34:24.280 --> 34:30.560]  the grand dragon, supreme leader of all of the clavrons
[34:30.560 --> 34:37.520]  and Cyclopsian protuberances, because this
[34:37.520 --> 34:39.120]  is the inversion of reality.
[34:39.120 --> 34:41.400]  We're going to get to this special live breakdown
[34:41.400 --> 34:43.160]  as I go through these clips here and on.
[34:43.160 --> 34:49.320]  First, again, Politico merging with the Washington Post
[34:49.320 --> 34:53.720]  in bed with the Clinton-Obama Combine up
[34:53.720 --> 35:02.680]  to their eyeballs, Bezos, absolutely sickening.
[35:02.680 --> 35:06.560]  Isn't that just darling?
[35:06.560 --> 35:09.000]  We're going to be breaking down the facts here
[35:09.000 --> 35:10.360]  in just a moment.
[35:10.360 --> 35:13.640]  But before I go any further, we launched yesterday
[35:13.640 --> 35:16.520]  the latest installment to the family
[35:16.520 --> 35:18.840]  of products and nutraceutical supplements
[35:18.840 --> 35:21.160]  at infowarslife.com.
[35:21.160 --> 35:23.360]  Biotrue selenium.
[35:23.360 --> 35:25.640]  And folks really responded, and that's great,
[35:25.640 --> 35:29.240]  because this is obviously something everybody needs.
[35:29.240 --> 35:31.040]  It's also super important because it
[35:31.040 --> 35:34.360]  helps fund the operation.
[35:34.360 --> 35:38.480]  But selenium is right up there with iodine and vitamin C.
[35:38.480 --> 35:40.240]  And of course, the three things work together.
[35:40.240 --> 35:42.400]  Synergistically, but when you take it with X2,
[35:42.400 --> 35:46.400]  Dr. Group says it just only magnifies what's happening.
[35:46.400 --> 35:51.040]  I personally get a lot of clean energy from it.
[35:51.040 --> 35:52.640]  So I'm kind of at the point of, like, do I
[35:52.640 --> 35:55.720]  take super mail with it, or do I even need super mail with it?
[35:55.720 --> 35:57.720]  I mean, I'm just being honest with people.
[35:57.720 --> 36:01.080]  You can gauge it for yourself or take one thing one day
[36:01.080 --> 36:04.280]  and something else the next and kind of alternate.
[36:04.280 --> 36:07.360]  But these are amazing, amazing products.
[36:07.360 --> 36:08.480]  Biotrue selenium.
[36:08.480 --> 36:10.960]  In fact, I was talking to Group, who's
[36:10.960 --> 36:14.040]  world-round for developing products
[36:14.040 --> 36:17.200]  because of his stringent quality levels.
[36:17.200 --> 36:19.120]  And he said, look, we are the best.
[36:19.120 --> 36:21.480]  I said, so this is really one of the top ones.
[36:21.480 --> 36:24.000]  So I said, I want to recommend some other brands and stuff.
[36:24.000 --> 36:25.080]  They're in stores.
[36:25.080 --> 36:26.400]  And he said, Alex, we were really
[36:26.400 --> 36:28.480]  putting all this in stores, and a lot of the products
[36:28.480 --> 36:29.120]  he's developed are.
[36:29.120 --> 36:33.680]  He said, this is the best from mustard seed.
[36:33.680 --> 36:36.760]  No one's got anything like this.
[36:36.760 --> 36:40.800]  And it really is super over-the-top quality.
[36:40.800 --> 36:44.160]  Available at infowarslife.com, or by calling toll free,
[36:44.160 --> 36:47.840]  888-253-3139.
[36:47.840 --> 36:49.760]  And then he was showing me online,
[36:49.760 --> 36:52.120]  speaking of the devil, Amazon, hundreds of it.
[36:52.120 --> 36:54.280]  He was pulling them up different seleniums
[36:54.280 --> 36:58.360]  that are out there for, like, 1995 and more
[36:58.360 --> 37:03.280]  that were smaller dosages and that was the synthetic type
[37:03.280 --> 37:04.720]  that you can't even really upload.
[37:04.720 --> 37:06.720]  And he was pulling up studies and showing those to me.
[37:06.720 --> 37:09.160]  He was showing some of them on air yesterday.
[37:09.160 --> 37:14.040]  It's just crazy that these companies just
[37:14.040 --> 37:15.880]  go out and do whatever's cheapest and easiest,
[37:15.880 --> 37:17.560]  and then gouge you.
[37:17.560 --> 37:20.280]  Ours is 1995.
[37:20.280 --> 37:25.280]  There are seleniums out there that are synthetic for $30.
[37:25.280 --> 37:26.640]  Total ripoff.
[37:26.640 --> 37:29.840]  I mean, take our prostaguard formula.
[37:29.840 --> 37:30.120]  What is it?
[37:30.120 --> 37:31.840]  Six or seven ingredients.
[37:31.840 --> 37:34.160]  The same level of sawpaw meadow that
[37:34.160 --> 37:40.240]  is in a leading competitor that I hear ads on the radio
[37:40.240 --> 37:42.880]  for $29.
[37:42.880 --> 37:48.400]  Ours is less and has all the other known safe ingredients
[37:48.400 --> 37:50.080]  for your prostate.
[37:50.080 --> 37:51.800]  And of course, if it's good for your prostate,
[37:51.800 --> 37:53.040]  it's good for everything.
[37:53.040 --> 37:54.840]  Women should be taking things like prostaguard.
[37:54.840 --> 37:57.120]  It's just things that your glands
[37:57.120 --> 37:58.640]  need to produce certain things.
[37:58.640 --> 37:59.520]  I mean, here's an example.
[37:59.520 --> 38:00.280]  There are studies out.
[38:00.280 --> 38:04.080]  You can look it up yourself that if you don't have selenium,
[38:04.080 --> 38:06.240]  but your brain electrochemically runs off of,
[38:06.240 --> 38:09.360]  if you're a male, it will take it from your brain
[38:09.360 --> 38:11.800]  and give it to your testicles.
[38:11.800 --> 38:15.080]  Because the body in our design sees procreation
[38:15.080 --> 38:18.720]  in an emergency starvation situation as more important
[38:18.720 --> 38:22.280]  than you living or you being smart.
[38:22.280 --> 38:24.560]  So I must have been deficient in it
[38:24.560 --> 38:29.320]  because I take it twice a day now, and it's amazing.
[38:29.320 --> 38:30.960]  All right, I'm going to stop talking about it.
[38:30.960 --> 38:32.680]  It's just that once I start discussing it,
[38:32.680 --> 38:34.720]  it really is that cool.
[38:34.720 --> 38:37.160]  And a lot of the things we have like DNA force
[38:37.160 --> 38:39.160]  are proprietary and really complex.
[38:39.160 --> 38:42.240]  And there's hundreds of studies per ingredient on it.
[38:42.240 --> 38:44.480]  You can even make claims with BioPQQ
[38:44.480 --> 38:46.120]  because it's a nutraceutical that they're trying
[38:46.120 --> 38:48.440]  to make it and other things, prescription now.
[38:50.320 --> 38:51.800]  But when you get down to just selenium,
[38:51.800 --> 38:54.160]  it's just selenium, but it's the good selenium.
[38:56.000 --> 38:57.960]  But whatever you do, do your own research
[38:57.960 --> 38:59.280]  and find out what I'm talking about.
[38:59.280 --> 39:00.720]  And there are natural ways to get it as well
[39:00.720 --> 39:04.440]  with nuts and stuff like that or in mustard seed.
[39:04.440 --> 39:08.120]  Whatever you do, you need to get the selenium
[39:08.120 --> 39:11.080]  in your body, you need to filter your water.
[39:11.080 --> 39:12.920]  And look, I know most of the audience knows
[39:12.920 --> 39:15.200]  this better than I am, I'm not preaching.
[39:15.200 --> 39:18.840]  I'm saying this to myself, take your supplements, Alex.
[39:18.840 --> 39:21.960]  Alex, don't drink that iced tea at the restaurant
[39:21.960 --> 39:24.200]  unless it's filtered water, ask them.
[39:24.200 --> 39:26.840]  And the more I ask and more you ask,
[39:26.840 --> 39:29.600]  more and more restaurants go, yes, we do filter our water.
[39:29.600 --> 39:31.160]  And I ask what type of thing?
[39:31.160 --> 39:32.120]  Oh, wait, Alex, I'm a listener
[39:32.120 --> 39:34.240]  and then the owner comes out from behind the counter.
[39:34.240 --> 39:37.000]  That has happened many times when I start asking
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.880]  about stuff and they go, let me ask the manager.
[39:38.880 --> 39:40.800]  And the manager comes over, oh, Alex, show, tell you.
[39:40.800 --> 39:42.920]  Yeah, the owner put filters in a couple of years ago
[39:42.920 --> 39:44.040]  where the owner comes over.
[39:44.040 --> 39:46.120]  You're like at Hop Dottie's hamburgers downtown
[39:46.120 --> 39:48.240]  and they says fluoride free water,
[39:48.240 --> 39:49.200]  it's really good filtered water.
[39:49.200 --> 39:51.160]  And you go in there and there's like a line
[39:51.160 --> 39:54.760]  sometimes down the block and the guy's a listener
[39:54.760 --> 39:56.760]  and the owner comes over and goes, yeah, free hamburgers,
[39:56.760 --> 39:59.280]  you're here, free hamburgers, Alex, yeah, I filter it.
[39:59.280 --> 40:04.280]  I mean, this is a culture where we demand quality, we get it.
[40:05.320 --> 40:07.760]  We raise the level of the culture,
[40:07.760 --> 40:10.680]  not dumb it down with austerity.
[40:10.680 --> 40:13.960]  The globalists are teaching us to not have good health.
[40:13.960 --> 40:15.480]  They're teaching us not to have freedom.
[40:15.480 --> 40:18.160]  They're teaching us we're bad and ugly and broken and stupid
[40:18.160 --> 40:21.520]  and we can't have air conditioning in cars, but Obama can't.
[40:21.520 --> 40:22.800]  How racist is that?
[40:22.800 --> 40:24.320]  In fact, before I do this special report,
[40:24.320 --> 40:26.720]  I'm gonna kinda get focused here and do it right now.
[40:26.720 --> 40:30.680]  Will you also get him saying to Africans
[40:30.680 --> 40:32.440]  in his African visit two years ago,
[40:32.440 --> 40:34.800]  you can't have cars or air conditioning?
[40:34.800 --> 40:38.080]  Because I mean, you talk about fundamental racism
[40:38.080 --> 40:41.680]  telling Africans you can't have technology
[40:41.680 --> 40:45.080]  and then killing Gaddafi because he was given it to Africa
[40:45.080 --> 40:46.840]  and he'd already helped five different countries
[40:46.840 --> 40:49.880]  and it actually stabilized those places and had a plan.
[40:53.880 --> 40:54.960]  I'm not gonna be dishonest.
[40:54.960 --> 40:57.880]  Gaddafi fought against the West in the 70s and 80s
[40:57.880 --> 40:59.160]  and things and did some things that were bad.
[40:59.160 --> 41:00.200]  He got framed for some stuff,
[41:00.200 --> 41:03.080]  but he really did some good stuff
[41:03.080 --> 41:04.560]  and I'm really ashamed of the fact
[41:04.560 --> 41:06.080]  that Hillary Clinton had him killed
[41:06.080 --> 41:07.040]  and then bragged about him.
[41:07.040 --> 41:10.320]  Again, the guy, see, the more I think about how racist she is
[41:12.600 --> 41:15.640]  in her actions, pushing to target blacks for abortion.
[41:15.640 --> 41:18.600]  It's just, I've got too much proof.
[41:18.600 --> 41:19.880]  I've got too much proof.
[41:19.880 --> 41:20.880]  I've got too much.
[41:20.880 --> 41:25.200]  And you know, Lewis Furkan, I know is torn by all this.
[41:27.200 --> 41:28.720]  I don't want to just sit here and hate on Lewis Furkan.
[41:28.720 --> 41:29.560]  That's easy to do.
[41:29.560 --> 41:32.200]  I actually want to try to see what the guy thinks.
[41:34.520 --> 41:35.480]  And he gets up there and he says,
[41:35.480 --> 41:38.600]  GD Barack Obama, you killed Muammar Gaddafi
[41:38.600 --> 41:40.080]  who was helping all of Africa.
[41:41.320 --> 41:44.400]  This guy wasn't a dictator with 200 Lamborghinis
[41:44.400 --> 41:46.360]  like some of those African dictators.
[41:46.360 --> 41:49.600]  He lived in a hut basically
[41:49.600 --> 41:51.560]  with a 10-foot wall around him
[41:51.560 --> 41:53.280]  and gave almost all the money
[41:53.280 --> 41:55.360]  directly to the people in infrastructure.
[41:55.360 --> 41:57.920]  Not in dependency, but in real jobs
[41:57.920 --> 42:00.560]  and college and engineering and in women.
[42:00.560 --> 42:02.160]  60% of their graduates there.
[42:03.640 --> 42:07.240]  And there's pictures of Obama inside Farrakhan Studio
[42:07.240 --> 42:09.440]  and some of those folks still support Obama.
[42:12.640 --> 42:14.800]  But I tell you, I haven't dinner with him for three hours.
[42:14.800 --> 42:15.640]  That guy's got a lot of stamina.
[42:15.640 --> 42:17.040]  I was exhausted.
[42:17.040 --> 42:17.880]  It was interesting.
[42:17.880 --> 42:19.200]  You know, I already interviewed him for hours
[42:19.200 --> 42:21.040]  and it's like it's a night and I'm in there for three hours.
[42:21.040 --> 42:23.080]  I said, sir, I got to go.
[42:23.080 --> 42:24.120]  I'm exhausted.
[42:25.480 --> 42:26.680]  I think there were a little insults about it.
[42:26.680 --> 42:28.200]  I said, I'm sleepy.
[42:30.200 --> 42:31.920]  But those guys are intense.
[42:31.920 --> 42:34.360]  The actual people that run the nation of Islam.
[42:35.600 --> 42:38.160]  I went to meet with them to try to work on stopping
[42:38.160 --> 42:40.200]  this race war the globalist are cooking up.
[42:40.200 --> 42:43.040]  And you know, I know people like
[42:43.040 --> 42:45.440]  Lewis Farrakhan put out conflicting messages
[42:45.440 --> 42:46.840]  and people can say that's flip-flopping.
[42:46.840 --> 42:49.920]  You know, it's different perspectives on different events
[42:49.920 --> 42:52.920]  that the media then basically spins and misrepresents.
[42:52.920 --> 42:54.920]  And I do disagree with Lewis Farrakhan on some things,
[42:54.920 --> 42:57.600]  but I think Lewis Farrakhan has come a long way.
[42:57.600 --> 42:59.200]  And I don't say that in a patronizing way.
[42:59.200 --> 43:00.320]  I've come a long way.
[43:01.360 --> 43:02.680]  You get more informed.
[43:02.680 --> 43:04.240]  You get wiser as you get older.
[43:05.200 --> 43:07.280]  And I learned stuff from Lewis Farrakhan
[43:07.280 --> 43:10.040]  watching C-SPAN when I was a teenager.
[43:10.040 --> 43:11.720]  I mean, he was talking about the private fellow reserve,
[43:11.720 --> 43:12.560]  the New World Order.
[43:12.560 --> 43:15.080]  And I knew that was true when I was 15 years old.
[43:15.080 --> 43:18.200]  I'm like, wow, who is this guy
[43:18.200 --> 43:19.560]  that's willing to talk about all these things?
[43:19.560 --> 43:22.480]  But a lot of times when you see a special report
[43:22.480 --> 43:24.120]  that we hear on the news, I come in here,
[43:24.120 --> 43:25.920]  I get everything lined up and I hit it for five,
[43:25.920 --> 43:28.120]  10 minutes, I get in that zone, I get focused.
[43:28.120 --> 43:30.240]  Kind of on radio, I've trained myself just to be
[43:30.240 --> 43:34.640]  kind of laissez-faire and totally unscripted,
[43:34.640 --> 43:39.280]  but to really get into the ultra-massive,
[43:39.280 --> 43:42.000]  true racist nature of Hillary Clinton.
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.440]  And when you actually look at the evidence,
[43:45.440 --> 43:46.280]  it makes your head spin.
[43:46.280 --> 43:48.760]  So I'm gonna skip this network break coming up.
[43:48.760 --> 43:49.600]  So I have plenty of time.
[43:49.600 --> 43:51.680]  I'm gonna focus right now.
[43:51.680 --> 43:53.400]  I'm gonna do my best to really get into this.
[43:53.400 --> 43:54.800]  And then I'm gonna take this clip
[43:54.800 --> 43:56.400]  and hopefully we can make it go viral
[43:56.400 --> 43:58.400]  to educate people that are being conned
[43:58.400 --> 44:00.800]  and manipulated out there.
[44:00.800 --> 44:01.640]  So here we go.
[44:06.800 --> 44:09.320]  Hillary Clinton has pulled every dirty trick
[44:09.320 --> 44:14.320]  in the book politically to try to shut down Donald Trump,
[44:14.560 --> 44:17.720]  who just as Nigel Farage in Europe
[44:17.720 --> 44:20.320]  is a symbol of populism,
[44:20.320 --> 44:22.000]  a symbol that we don't wanna be ruled
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.240]  by foreign multinational corporations
[44:24.240 --> 44:28.240]  and huge TPP secret combines they've set up.
[44:28.240 --> 44:30.840]  This is just a repeat of King George in England
[44:30.840 --> 44:34.840]  ruling over the 13 colonies back in 1775
[44:34.840 --> 44:36.080]  and the people saying,
[44:36.080 --> 44:39.520]  we are not gonna be pushed around anymore.
[44:39.520 --> 44:44.520]  The establishment media has dropped any illusion
[44:44.560 --> 44:47.800]  that they aren't total servants of this corporate elite
[44:47.800 --> 44:50.480]  and this international corporate elites minion,
[44:50.480 --> 44:52.560]  Hillary Rodham Clinton,
[44:52.560 --> 44:57.560]  a pampered silver spoon technocrat from her days in college
[44:59.320 --> 45:03.880]  trained by Saul Olensky rules for radicals
[45:03.880 --> 45:06.880]  who dedicated his book to Lucifer.
[45:06.880 --> 45:09.520]  Seeing in even calls her a golden goddess
[45:09.520 --> 45:11.400]  and says that we should worship her.
[45:12.440 --> 45:15.160]  And now Politico is reporting today,
[45:15.160 --> 45:16.880]  Drudge Report has the story.
[45:18.000 --> 45:21.240]  Hillary plays the clan card on Trump.
[45:22.120 --> 45:25.720]  We're gonna play this clip of her saying he's a racist
[45:25.720 --> 45:27.280]  and then we're gonna go to the clips
[45:27.280 --> 45:31.840]  of where she has said exactly what Trump is now saying.
[45:31.840 --> 45:34.640]  Now that makes her a hypocrite and a liar and a deceiver,
[45:34.640 --> 45:35.960]  not the racist part.
[45:35.960 --> 45:38.840]  Then we'll get into why she's a racist.
[45:38.840 --> 45:43.520]  But first let's hear from sick Hillary.
[45:43.520 --> 45:46.120]  Here she is talking about Trump.
[45:46.120 --> 45:49.240]  Is taking a hate movement mainstream.
[45:49.240 --> 45:51.800]  He's brought it into his campaign.
[45:51.800 --> 45:54.800]  He's bringing it to our communities and our countries
[45:54.800 --> 45:58.160]  and someone who's questioned the citizenship
[45:58.160 --> 46:00.720]  of the first African-American president
[46:00.720 --> 46:03.680]  who has courted white supremacists
[46:03.680 --> 46:07.080]  who've been sued for housing discrimination
[46:07.080 --> 46:09.280]  against communities of color.
[46:09.280 --> 46:12.520]  Who's attacked a judge for his Mexican heritage
[46:12.520 --> 46:17.120]  and promised a mass deportation force.
[46:17.120 --> 46:22.120]  Is someone who is very much peddling bigotry
[46:23.240 --> 46:26.000]  and prejudice and paranoia.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.440]  I will have more to say about this tomorrow
[46:29.440 --> 46:31.040]  when I give a speech in Reno.
[46:31.040 --> 46:32.240]  Well, let me.
[46:32.240 --> 46:34.440]  Okay, so there's another issue here.
[46:34.440 --> 46:37.880]  She calls this a press conference phoning in on CNN.
[46:37.880 --> 46:39.360]  She can't even be on Skype.
[46:39.360 --> 46:40.520]  She can't even be on video.
[46:40.520 --> 46:41.520]  She can't even be seen.
[46:41.520 --> 46:43.020]  Sounds like she's laying down.
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.320]  And then she says, oh, I have had press conferences.
[46:47.320 --> 46:49.840]  It hasn't been 260 something days.
[46:49.840 --> 46:52.160]  I have journalists into my home or my jet.
[46:52.160 --> 46:54.240]  Oh, you're little minion friends.
[46:54.240 --> 46:56.840]  You call that a press conference.
[46:56.840 --> 46:59.280]  When you get a couple of lapdog media people
[46:59.280 --> 47:01.020]  use limbo stern in your lap.
[47:01.020 --> 47:02.560]  No, that's not a press conference.
[47:02.560 --> 47:04.040]  You don't control reality.
[47:04.040 --> 47:06.700]  Now, let's go over this clip piece by piece.
[47:06.700 --> 47:11.120]  The last clip as we document the deception here.
[47:11.120 --> 47:14.480]  Clinton calls Trump racist in this 45 second clip
[47:14.480 --> 47:16.760]  bringing up that he has been questioned
[47:16.760 --> 47:18.400]  the president's citizenship.
[47:18.400 --> 47:22.800]  Well, I have the Washington Post here in my stack
[47:22.800 --> 47:25.720]  where they admit that Hillary Clinton
[47:25.720 --> 47:30.720]  is where the Bertha conspiracy first came from.
[47:30.840 --> 47:31.680]  It's true.
[47:31.680 --> 47:35.000]  When she was running against him in 2008.
[47:36.560 --> 47:39.040]  And we looked into it and it was weird
[47:39.040 --> 47:40.840]  that all his literature said he was born and kidnapped.
[47:40.840 --> 47:42.520]  We said, yeah, why do you say that?
[47:42.520 --> 47:43.360]  But now you say you don't.
[47:43.360 --> 47:46.040]  It was a cover for the fact of who his real dad was,
[47:46.040 --> 47:47.880]  Frank Marshall Davis, but that's another issue.
[47:47.880 --> 47:50.560]  But she's, again, everything she says is what she did.
[47:50.560 --> 47:51.840]  Listen to this.
[47:51.840 --> 47:53.240]  We just played the clip.
[47:53.240 --> 47:55.920]  They go on to say the Bertha movement that she started
[47:55.920 --> 47:58.200]  courted a white supremacist.
[47:58.200 --> 47:59.040]  No, he didn't.
[47:59.040 --> 48:01.360]  He in fact personally disavowed him
[48:01.360 --> 48:04.120]  to the ends of the earth decades ago
[48:04.120 --> 48:05.720]  before the new controversy,
[48:05.720 --> 48:10.720]  which Clinton did not do towards violent zealots.
[48:11.240 --> 48:15.240]  Sadiq Mateen, who again stood for discrimination
[48:15.240 --> 48:16.640]  against communities of color.
[48:16.640 --> 48:18.600]  And it goes on and on and on.
[48:18.600 --> 48:21.280]  A lawsuit that was settled with no admission
[48:21.280 --> 48:26.280]  with doing all of it because the Trump family did not want
[48:26.520 --> 48:30.720]  to rent to welfare recipients who do not otherwise qualify
[48:30.720 --> 48:33.040]  for our apartments in our buildings.
[48:33.040 --> 48:33.880]  Yeah.
[48:33.880 --> 48:36.440]  I mean, you're trying to get a super fancy apartment
[48:36.440 --> 48:41.280]  and you don't have a job and you don't have good credit.
[48:41.280 --> 48:44.120]  And then they try to pass laws saying they're going to
[48:44.120 --> 48:47.080]  give poor welfare recipients nice apartments.
[48:47.080 --> 48:52.080]  And they're saying, sorry, no, it ain't gonna happen.
[48:54.120 --> 48:57.560]  Again, he attacked a judge for his Mexican heritage.
[48:57.560 --> 48:59.200]  That's the claim she makes.
[48:59.200 --> 49:03.920]  Or he stated that he was not going to get a fair case
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.560]  in a frivolous lawsuit because of a corrupt democratic judge
[49:08.560 --> 49:12.600]  who also happens to be an actual Hispanic racist
[49:12.600 --> 49:14.440]  organization called La Raza,
[49:14.440 --> 49:17.640]  which embodies the essence of racism,
[49:17.640 --> 49:20.600]  advocates for a mass deportation force
[49:20.600 --> 49:23.720]  because a nation without borders cannot function
[49:23.720 --> 49:25.960]  and will be overrun kind of like Europe
[49:25.960 --> 49:27.440]  is experiencing right now.
[49:28.600 --> 49:32.760]  So those are points just countering each little piece
[49:32.760 --> 49:35.800]  of the 45 seconds that we went over.
[49:36.640 --> 49:38.280]  And I haven't even scratched the surface.
[49:38.280 --> 49:41.200]  Right now I'm just showing you how everything she said there
[49:41.200 --> 49:44.800]  is a deception, a spin, a lie.
[49:44.800 --> 49:47.360]  Now let's get to where she's a hypocrite
[49:47.360 --> 49:50.000]  and has said the things that Donald Trump has said.
[49:50.000 --> 49:51.280]  We've got a bunch of these clips.
[49:51.280 --> 49:54.840]  Some are from 96, some are from 2005, some are from 2008.
[49:54.840 --> 49:56.240]  Let's just start rolling them.
[49:58.720 --> 49:59.920]  Hi, Secretary Clinton.
[49:59.920 --> 50:03.360]  I was wondering what you think about like securing
[50:03.360 --> 50:05.480]  the Mexican border with some of the illegal immigrants
[50:05.480 --> 50:06.320]  that come in.
[50:06.320 --> 50:07.880]  Just wondering.
[50:07.880 --> 50:12.520]  Well, look, I voted numerous times when I was a senator
[50:12.520 --> 50:17.240]  to spend money to build a barrier
[50:17.240 --> 50:21.520]  to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in.
[50:22.480 --> 50:25.560]  And I do think you have to control your borders.
[50:26.800 --> 50:30.560]  Okay, now let's go ahead and play her.
[50:30.560 --> 50:31.720]  That was from 2005.
[50:31.720 --> 50:33.880]  Let's go ahead and play another Hillary clip.
[50:33.880 --> 50:38.080]  Mexico is such an important problem.
[50:38.080 --> 50:42.160]  Mexican government's policies are pushing migration north.
[50:42.160 --> 50:44.960]  There isn't any sensible approach
[50:44.960 --> 50:48.000]  except to do what we need to do simultaneously.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.960]  Secure our borders with technology, personnel,
[50:50.960 --> 50:53.440]  physical barriers if necessary in some places.
[50:53.440 --> 50:55.840]  And we need to have tougher employer sanctions
[50:55.840 --> 50:59.360]  and we need to kind of incentivize Mexico to do.
[50:59.360 --> 51:02.560]  Okay, so that is First Lady Hillary Rotem Clinton
[51:02.560 --> 51:04.600]  in 1999 on C-SPAN.
[51:07.080 --> 51:09.040]  We've got more of these, but in the interest of time,
[51:09.040 --> 51:12.840]  let's play her husband, then President of the United States,
[51:12.840 --> 51:17.440]  in 1996 addressing Congress.
[51:17.440 --> 51:19.320]  This is from C-SPAN.
[51:19.320 --> 51:20.160]  Here it is.
[51:21.120 --> 51:24.000]  All Americans, not only in the States,
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.360]  most heavily affected, but in every place in this country
[51:26.360 --> 51:29.360]  are rightly disturbed by the large numbers
[51:29.360 --> 51:33.040]  of illegal aliens entering our country.
[51:33.040 --> 51:35.000]  The jobs they hold might otherwise be held
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  by citizens or legal immigrants.
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.160]  The public service they use imposes burdens
[51:39.160 --> 51:41.000]  on our taxpayers.
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.320]  That's why our administration has moved aggressively
[51:43.320 --> 51:45.200]  to secure our borders more
[51:45.200 --> 51:47.680]  by hiring a record number of new border guards,
[51:47.680 --> 51:51.080]  by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before,
[51:51.080 --> 51:53.600]  by cracking down on illegal hiring,
[51:53.600 --> 51:56.920]  by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.
[51:56.920 --> 51:58.480]  In the budget I will present to you,
[51:58.480 --> 52:01.560]  we will try to do more to speed the deportation
[52:01.560 --> 52:04.000]  of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes,
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.880]  to better identify illegal aliens in the work face
[52:06.880 --> 52:08.440]  as recommended by the commission
[52:08.440 --> 52:11.000]  headed by former Congresswoman, Barbidge.
[52:12.200 --> 52:16.360]  Okay, so Politico, the Associated Press, CNN,
[52:16.360 --> 52:18.400]  thousands of media outlets, probably an hour.
[52:18.400 --> 52:19.760]  I mean, there's thousands of articles
[52:19.760 --> 52:21.000]  popping up every few hours,
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.720]  calling Donald Trump a racist, deeply racist,
[52:23.720 --> 52:25.280]  connections to white supremacists,
[52:25.280 --> 52:27.840]  and then you read there is no connection
[52:27.840 --> 52:30.800]  on his own 20 years ago, and then a decade ago,
[52:30.800 --> 52:33.080]  he would bring up the KKK and say they're terrible
[52:33.080 --> 52:35.560]  and talk bad about David Deux.
[52:35.560 --> 52:38.640]  On his own, it's like I've gone out and protested
[52:38.640 --> 52:41.640]  the KKK more than 10 times, because I wanted to,
[52:41.640 --> 52:43.600]  because I knew that feds were running it.
[52:43.600 --> 52:45.360]  Now that'd be like saying 20 years from now,
[52:45.360 --> 52:48.600]  I'm a supporter of the KKK, when I have the proof,
[52:48.600 --> 52:52.480]  I'm not just someone who says now I don't like them,
[52:52.480 --> 52:54.120]  I didn't like them 20 years ago.
[52:54.120 --> 52:55.080]  You understand that?
[52:55.080 --> 52:56.600]  It's the same thing here.
[52:56.600 --> 52:57.880]  And then they go, you won't disavow.
[52:57.880 --> 53:01.000]  And he's like, I disavow in the same press conference.
[53:01.000 --> 53:02.200]  Next question, you won't disavow.
[53:02.200 --> 53:03.600]  He goes, I just disavowed.
[53:03.600 --> 53:05.160]  Five minutes later, you won't disavow.
[53:05.160 --> 53:06.560]  I just disavowed.
[53:06.560 --> 53:08.560]  And that's just like when I've had
[53:08.560 --> 53:10.600]  different guests on the show, and I keep saying,
[53:10.600 --> 53:12.240]  why won't you disavow your racist?
[53:12.240 --> 53:13.600]  And they go, I'm not.
[53:13.600 --> 53:15.000]  And I go, why don't you disavow?
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.160]  They go, I just said it.
[53:16.160 --> 53:19.080]  And it gets really obnoxious, and they get really upset,
[53:19.080 --> 53:20.440]  because I'm putting them on the spot.
[53:20.440 --> 53:21.840]  Even though they know it's a joke,
[53:21.840 --> 53:25.480]  it's still asking somebody, why are you a child molester?
[53:25.480 --> 53:26.760]  Or why do you beat your wife?
[53:26.760 --> 53:28.600]  Or why do you rob banks?
[53:28.600 --> 53:30.320]  This is what she's doing.
[53:30.320 --> 53:32.320]  But the media is outraged now that Trump
[53:32.320 --> 53:34.200]  has come out and called her a bigot,
[53:34.200 --> 53:35.040]  which is actually true.
[53:35.040 --> 53:38.560]  They're like, hell, that's outrageous, a new,
[53:38.560 --> 53:40.720]  as they're all doing it with no proof.
[53:40.720 --> 53:43.040]  He's got proof, but he's in a new low.
[53:44.920 --> 53:46.800]  So let's go to Hillary.
[53:46.800 --> 53:48.600]  She got asked about this by major papers
[53:48.600 --> 53:50.520]  after it happened, and she said, well, yes,
[53:50.520 --> 53:52.960]  those gangs are predominantly black,
[53:52.960 --> 53:54.480]  and they're super predators.
[53:54.480 --> 53:56.680]  And they need to be made to come to heal.
[53:56.680 --> 54:00.240]  But this isn't even the total proof of her racism.
[54:00.240 --> 54:03.200]  It's her real actions, and we'll get to that in a moment,
[54:03.200 --> 54:06.120]  because they put the minimum sentencing in,
[54:06.120 --> 54:08.520]  and the reason I was really against this is because, yeah,
[54:08.520 --> 54:10.880]  three, four, five times more time for crack cocaine
[54:10.880 --> 54:15.120]  than powder cocaine, knowing that more wealthy people,
[54:15.120 --> 54:17.760]  no matter what color they are, would use the powder
[54:17.760 --> 54:21.320]  than the crack that was pushed into the neighborhoods.
[54:21.320 --> 54:23.640]  And when was that done?
[54:24.520 --> 54:26.880]  That was done big time through the 80s and the 90s.
[54:26.880 --> 54:27.880]  The Clintons continued it.
[54:27.880 --> 54:29.720]  They ran Mina, Arkansas.
[54:29.720 --> 54:33.120]  I've had the CIA pilots that ran the operation on,
[54:33.120 --> 54:34.320]  like Terry Reed.
[54:35.640 --> 54:39.360]  They were flying C-130s in filled with cocaine.
[54:39.360 --> 54:40.880]  She pushed the drugs.
[54:40.880 --> 54:43.520]  I've had Freeway Rick Ross on, the real Rick Ross,
[54:43.520 --> 54:44.520]  not the fat rapper.
[54:46.760 --> 54:47.680]  He's broken it down.
[54:47.680 --> 54:51.280]  It is, we ought to get Rick Ross on about this.
[54:51.280 --> 54:54.160]  The real deal and lay out what he thinks of the Clintons.
[54:54.160 --> 54:56.600]  So it goes on and on, but regardless,
[54:56.600 --> 54:58.680]  minimum sentencing targeting black people,
[55:00.440 --> 55:03.080]  which then puts them in prisons
[55:03.080 --> 55:05.760]  and they come out real criminals,
[55:05.760 --> 55:07.600]  you don't get a five year education in college
[55:07.600 --> 55:08.880]  or four year or eight year.
[55:08.880 --> 55:12.200]  You get a 10 year education or five year education
[55:12.200 --> 55:16.040]  in a prison, and all you have is criminal contacts
[55:16.040 --> 55:18.280]  when you come out, and the criminal culture
[55:18.280 --> 55:20.280]  and the criminal population grows
[55:20.280 --> 55:21.800]  and swallows up the country.
[55:21.800 --> 55:23.720]  Now we're getting into the real racism of the Clintons,
[55:23.720 --> 55:28.720]  but let's play this clip of her, Hillary Clinton,
[55:28.880 --> 55:32.040]  talking about blacks being super predators.
[55:32.040 --> 55:34.480]  They are not just gangs of kids anymore.
[55:34.480 --> 55:36.480]  They are often the kinds of kids
[55:36.480 --> 55:38.240]  that are called super predators.
[55:38.240 --> 55:40.280]  No conscience, no empathy.
[55:40.280 --> 55:42.280]  We can talk about why they ended up that way,
[55:42.280 --> 55:44.200]  but first we have to bring them to heel,
[55:44.200 --> 55:46.120]  and the president has asked the FBI
[55:46.120 --> 55:50.240]  to launch a very concerted effort against gangs everywhere.
[55:50.240 --> 55:53.440]  In addition to that, he has appointed a new drug czar.
[55:53.440 --> 55:55.080]  You probably saw him Tuesday night.
[55:55.080 --> 55:58.360]  He's one of the most distinguished actors in the military.
[55:58.360 --> 55:59.560]  And then you can go to the Washington Post articles
[55:59.560 --> 56:01.200]  with the make them heel comments
[56:01.200 --> 56:03.720]  and other similar permutations of the speech.
[56:03.720 --> 56:06.120]  She was giving a 1996 on the campaign trail.
[56:06.120 --> 56:08.000]  That's just one version of it.
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.000]  Now, continuing, she has now come out saying
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.040]  that Trump is tired of the KKK.
[56:16.040 --> 56:16.960]  I'm gonna play this clip.
[56:16.960 --> 56:18.640]  This is her latest salvo.
[56:18.640 --> 56:20.440]  Now we're not even seeing her though.
[56:20.440 --> 56:25.200]  Now it's phone calls for days, but that's okay.
[56:25.200 --> 56:27.480]  She doesn't go visit the predominantly black folks
[56:27.480 --> 56:29.520]  in Louisiana that are swamped.
[56:29.520 --> 56:30.840]  No, no, because it's okay though,
[56:30.840 --> 56:34.960]  because she sat at the foot of the head of the KKK,
[56:34.960 --> 56:36.160]  Senator Robert Byrd.
[56:36.160 --> 56:38.240]  It's okay to me to say he's your mentor
[56:38.240 --> 56:40.600]  and to go to his funeral and say how much you love him,
[56:40.600 --> 56:45.200]  because he's an actual grand dragon supreme ruler.
[56:45.200 --> 56:46.120]  And I use those terms
[56:46.120 --> 56:47.520]  because that's the little stupid terms
[56:47.520 --> 56:48.440]  and things they use.
[56:48.440 --> 56:52.000]  I mean, you're grand super supreme goblin pig,
[56:52.000 --> 56:57.000]  warthog master, whatever Cyclops is.
[56:57.080 --> 56:59.680]  I mean, I'm serious, it's really entertaining.
[56:59.680 --> 57:03.280]  But let's go back to the baby grand dragon,
[57:03.280 --> 57:05.680]  saying that Trump is KKK.
[57:05.680 --> 57:06.640]  Here it is.
[57:06.640 --> 57:09.480]  The reason a lot of Klan members like Donald Trump
[57:09.480 --> 57:12.040]  is because a lot of what he believes, we believe in.
[57:12.040 --> 57:13.280]  The reason a lot of Klan members like Donald Trump
[57:13.280 --> 57:14.600]  is because a lot of what he believes, we believe in.
[57:14.600 --> 57:16.720]  The reason a lot of Klan members like Donald Trump
[57:16.720 --> 57:18.760]  is because a lot of what he believes, we believe in.
[57:18.760 --> 57:20.520]  Donald Trump would be best for the job for president.
[57:20.520 --> 57:21.320]  Yeah, I am a farmer and white nationalist.
[57:21.320 --> 57:22.640]  Support Donald Trump.
[57:22.640 --> 57:25.800]  Sending out all the illegals, building a wall
[57:25.800 --> 57:28.760]  and a moratorium on Islamic immigration.
[57:28.760 --> 57:31.760]  That's very appealing to a lot of ordinary white people.
[57:31.760 --> 57:33.720]  Running against Donald Trump at this point
[57:33.720 --> 57:35.960]  is really treason to your heritage.
[57:35.960 --> 57:38.040]  Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke
[57:38.040 --> 57:39.480]  and say that you don't want his vote
[57:39.480 --> 57:41.160]  or that of other white supremacists?
[57:41.160 --> 57:43.200]  I don't know anything about white supremacists,
[57:43.200 --> 57:44.480]  so I don't know.
[57:44.480 --> 57:48.040]  Trump named Steve Bannon as his new campaign CEO.
[57:48.040 --> 57:50.480]  Mr. Bannon is best known for his controversial
[57:50.480 --> 57:54.120]  Breitbart News campaign chair that ran a website
[57:54.120 --> 57:56.280]  that has become a field day for the alt-right,
[57:56.280 --> 57:58.960]  which is racist and all sorts of otherists.
[57:58.960 --> 58:02.680]  The alt-right, which is the sort of dressed-up-in-suits version
[58:02.680 --> 58:05.480]  of the neo-Nazi and white supremacist movements.
[58:05.480 --> 58:07.960]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[58:07.960 --> 58:13.120]  Okay, so they also have one of these top Klan's guys
[58:13.120 --> 58:14.640]  in California endorsing Hillary.
[58:14.640 --> 58:17.400]  These are all just publicity stunts these guys pull.
[58:18.680 --> 58:21.440]  And where'd the Klan come from?
[58:21.440 --> 58:22.560]  The Democratic Party.
[58:23.640 --> 58:25.280]  Hillary Clinton, when they were running for governor,
[58:25.280 --> 58:29.680]  was putting out rebel flag pins to get elected.
[58:29.680 --> 58:33.120]  These people are total sociopaths
[58:33.120 --> 58:36.280]  and they love modern slavery, they love the drug war,
[58:36.280 --> 58:38.920]  they took out Gaddafi, they destabilized Africa,
[58:38.920 --> 58:41.840]  she funds abortion, expanding against black people.
[58:41.840 --> 58:43.800]  I mean, this is crazy.

[59:54.320 --> 59:57.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:57.400 --> 01:00:04.400]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones,
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.400]  coming to you right from the front lines of the info war.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:18.400]  I want you, I want you, I want you,
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:22.400]  I want you, I want you, I want you,
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:26.400]  I want you, I want you, I want you,
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:31.400]  I need you, I want you to be my 10 mates.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.400]  You need me, if he is me.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.400]  Look, you have to understand the whole thing in the South,
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.400]  the KKK, all of it, if you actually study history,
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:50.400]  was probably 80% or so of the South were poor farmers
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.400]  when the colonies were basically set up.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.400]  And a lot of them came in as indentured servants.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:01.400]  You'd serve a five, seven, eight, or 10-year term.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.400]  And you could basically be locked up in prison for life
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.400]  if you tried to ever break that contract.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:13.400]  And it was one step above full bore slavery.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:17.400]  It was a term of servitude.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.400]  Or basically what the Bible would call like a bond slave.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:26.400]  Okay, and then the sharecroppers
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.400]  were always basically competing with the plantations.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:33.400]  And there was all sorts of friction between that.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:38.400]  And then once slavery began to decline and end
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.400]  because of lesser expansion, and also because the British
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.400]  had declared it outlawed worldwide
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.400]  and were attacking anybody that was involved in it.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.400]  And I'm kind of getting into a history lesson here
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.400]  because I was just joined this last hour documenting
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.400]  how Hillary Clinton claims that Trump's connected to the KKK
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.400]  is beyond boulder dash when she has all these real connections.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:04.400]  But it was a political system to control poor white people
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.400]  and then to organize them into groups
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.400]  that could basically be controlled.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:14.400]  And the KKK acted in most areas of the South as a gang,
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:18.400]  really a boss-hog good old boys that would run around
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.400]  and go after whoever they wanted.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:27.400]  And sometimes they would side with a different town
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.400]  or different area on one issue and other times they wouldn't.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:37.400]  It was all just basically organized crime is what it turned into.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.400]  It did not start as that.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.400]  It started as basically vigilante groups
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.400]  during reconstruction in the South that was very oppressive
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.400]  and just incredible atrocities.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:52.400]  That was just one group or organization that developed to resist it.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.400]  But by the time reconstruction ended,
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:01.400]  oh, the defense group that was involved in defenses
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:04.400]  of northern looting that was epic.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.400]  That's what armies do.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.400]  It went on for a decade.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.400]  There were battles in capitals, the Texas capitol,
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.400]  repeatedly had northern governors that were installed thrown out.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.400]  There were cannons firing down Congress.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.400]  Miles from where I said there were huge wars.
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.400]  None of that's in movies.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.400]  None of that's...
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.400]  Imagine those would be amazing movies.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.400]  But you're not allowed to really see the complexity and the flavor of history
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.400]  and really how the more we change, the more we stay the same
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.400]  and people just act like people.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.400]  But see, they dumb all of that down, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.400]  And Hillary just sits there and says,
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:47.400]  oh, Donald Trump's with KKK with no proof and then edits some video together.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.400]  And the media is now asking him to disavow it again.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.400]  He's done it hundreds of times.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.400]  They say, you will not disavow.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.400]  And now, of course, it turned out they were cutting his audio on and off.
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.400]  He's saying, what?
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.400]  Why supremacists?
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.400]  I don't know.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.400]  That's what Trump does when something blips.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.400]  You can see him or he'll just...
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.400]  He won't even say excuse me or I didn't hear that.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.400]  He'll just give some non sequitur, just kind of filler.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.400]  And I've really learned a lot about Trump.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.400]  And I've had mainstream media do that to me, too, where they're...
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.400]  I'm on satellite and they're turning my audio down
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.400]  where I can't hear what they're saying to make me sound stupid
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.400]  and make it sound like one of their favorite things.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.400]  They do this to a lot of people.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.400]  They'll say...
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:30.400]  And see the public would know this because they hadn't been on satellite TV hundreds of times.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.400]  Being interviewed.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.400]  The media will do things like,
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:37.400]  so who was the Secretary of State at that time?
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.400]  The historian or...
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.400]  And what is the name of that bill?
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.400]  They'll fade your audio down.
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.400]  I mean, CNN and MSNBC are crooked, folks.
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.400]  And then you'll go, excuse me, excuse me.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.400]  They'll go, oh, you don't know?
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.400]  Oh!
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.400]  I mean, they play these incredible dirty tricks
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.400]  and people have to be aware.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:57.400]  The bad guys, the corrupt power structure is against Trump.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.400]  Now, Trump is a gamble.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.400]  But voting for them is no gamble at all.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.400]  It's a sure loser.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:04.400]  Hillary Clinton had lined the Jimmy Kimmel Show this week
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.400]  playing to the camera, opening pickle jars, laughter, and all smiles.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.400]  Relateability, right?
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:13.400]  Well, would it shock you to know that if TV ratings are any indication,
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:17.400]  voters were more interested in watching Robot Chicken and Teen Mom Season 6
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.400]  rather than Hillary Clinton?
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.400]  Low ratings?
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.400]  Hey, what difference does it make, right?
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.400]  Now, Donald Trump, meanwhile, was a smash hit in Austin, Texas,
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.400]  breaking a record for rally attendees.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.400]  Some have reported 10,000 through the door,
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:32.400]  as many as 2,000 turned away because of no seats.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.400]  It's a very common theme in his appearances across the country.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.400]  Meanwhile, Clinton, who's also campaigning,
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.400]  has little turnout, unable to fill seats.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.400]  But Hillary somehow comes out ahead in every poll
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.400]  with the exception of just a few.
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.400]  Now, that makes sense, doesn't it?
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.400]  If the mainstream media polls are any indication,
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.400]  one would think that Hillary has a major lead over Trump.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.400]  However, if last night's TV ratings were in,
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.400]  you'd think that Americans would rather watch paint dry
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.400]  and hear her tell a joke.
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:02.400]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for infowars.com.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:32.400]  Including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants,
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.400]  volatile organic contaminants and hormones,

[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:05.400]  Secret 12, Infowars Life's vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:09.400]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.400]  and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.400]  That's why, for real results,
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.400]  so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections,
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.400]  which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.400]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.400]  that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:28.400]  that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.400]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimentical grade,
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:34.400]  bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12,
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:37.400]  methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections,
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.400]  and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.400]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue,
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.400]  and then swallowed.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.400]  No needles, no injections.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.400]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.400]  Try it for yourself.
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.400]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.400]  He aligns himself with the truth,
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.400]  and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:21.400]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:32.400]  Well, they're back at it.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.400]  With 74 days left,
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.400]  they are running national TV ads.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.400]  We aired it last hour saying that
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:41.400]  Donald Trump is with the KKK,
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.400]  and then he's going to bring the KKK in
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:46.400]  to take over the government.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.400]  And then for proof,
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.400]  they cut to Stephen Bannon of Breitbart,
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.400]  an investment banker
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.400]  who is about as radical on immigration
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.400]  as Hillary Clinton was
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.400]  in 2008.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.400]  I mean, we have a bunch of clips.
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.400]  I only played some of them last hour because we ran out of time.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.400]  We're in 2008 running against Obama.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.400]  She said build a border, build a fence, build a wall.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:10.400]  We played three clips of that
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.400]  of other times she said it
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.400]  in the last hour.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:16.400]  By the way, Mexico has a wall
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.400]  and Mexico has a fence,
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.400]  and they give you six months to one year
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.400]  hard labor
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.400]  if you're caught.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.400]  And by the way,
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.400]  they have to, I'm not defending the fact
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.400]  that they torture people. That was in the one in Guardian too.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.400]  Oh yeah, they torture people
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.400]  that hire immigrants,
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.400]  all of these
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.400]  trendy kids,
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.400]  college students and others,
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:42.400]  try to move to Mexico and slack.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.400]  It's in the news
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.400]  that they
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.400]  get them, they throw them in jail
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.400]  and they tell them you call your mommy
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.400]  and you call your daddy and they bail you out
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.400]  for $20,000.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.400]  In fact, the Mexican cops on record will sit there
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.400]  and see how much money your family's got.
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.400]  Maybe you're going to spend a couple years,
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.400]  but that's not racist.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.400]  It actually kind of really isn't. They don't care who you are.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.400]  White, Hispanic, no matter.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.400]  They are going to shake you down
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.400]  in many of those areas.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.400]  But that's okay though. That's okay.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.400]  We're the only country, except for areas
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.400]  in Europe where they say come in and everything's free.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.400]  Let me get George Soros emails
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.400]  that have just been leaked the last three weeks
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.400]  finally starting to hit the news.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.400]  The mainstream news
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.400]  saying we're bringing in all these
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.400]  immigrants to create an underclass and control them
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.400]  and then use them to politically
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.400]  change the map.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.400]  They are slave masters
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.400]  that want to manage a permanent underclass.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:41.400]  They are cold-blooded racist.
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.400]  And then he goes on to admit
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.400]  we're going to collapse everything.
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:48.400]  This is just the beginning.
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.400]  And even the Jerusalem Post said
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.400]  he's a megalomaniac
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.400]  showing chaos globally
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.400]  who thinks he's the Messiah.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.400]  Because you can go look it up.
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.400]  George Soros says I have to keep it secret,
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.400]  but I've thought I was the Messiah
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.400]  since I was a young man.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.400]  That's like
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.400]  Rupert Murdoch
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.400]  has made bizarre statements but nothing like that.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.400]  Or Ted Turner has said
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.400]  that again he wants to go
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.400]  to heaven and punch God in the nose.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.400]  I mean these people think they're God.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.400]  Ray Kurzweil said I don't believe in God
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.400]  yet I'm going to become God.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.400]  Oh yeah, right.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.400]  I'm not even attacking Ray Kurzweil
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.400]  but I wouldn't get on a ship
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.400]  he was captaining. Not even God
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.400]  could sink this ship.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.400]  That's what the press said
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.400]  on the Titanic's maiden voyage.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.400]  I mean I've learned folks
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.400]  you don't tempt fate and shooting your mouth off.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.400]  Hillary going around going,
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.400]  I came, I saw, Gaddafi died.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.400]  Real people that kill folks
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.400]  don't ever talk like that.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.400]  They're very superstitious about it
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.400]  because they've learned.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.400]  Some guy brags how tough he is
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.400]  and how good he is at killing people.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.400]  He gets his head blown off that day.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.400]  Hillary won't even show up now
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.400]  to press conferences of 260 plus days
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.400]  and now calls phone calls to the media
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.400]  of press conference or having a few reporters
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.400]  that are lap dogs into her house.
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.400]  There's that whole controversy
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.400]  we're going to cover this hour
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.400]  with Mr. Rappaport of NoMoreFakeNews.com
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.400]  but now they're saying
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.400]  he is the KKK.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.400]  Paul Watson's article is great.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.400]  It just went up
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.400]  but it's not even strong enough in the headline.
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.400]  It's Hillary Slam's KKK
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.400]  Trump
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.400]  but her friend and mentor was KKK member
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.400]  Robert Byrd. He wasn't a member.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.400]  He was the Grand
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.400]  Dragon
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.400]  and then you can go look it up
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.400]  on his own bio. He became the head
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.400]  of the KKK.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.400]  Nationwide.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.400]  What's the stupid name?
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.400]  Like Supreme Dragon or
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.400]  Hobgoblin or the Claviners of the
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.400]  Snoopy Dolls?
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.400]  What the head of the KKK has called him
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.400]  and I've looked it up before. I know he was the head of it.
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.400]  The head of the KKK.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.400]  KISSINGER.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.400]  Imagine we had photos of
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.400]  Trump holding hands with
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.400]  Donald Trump.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.400]  We had Donald Trump holding hands with
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.400]  what's his name? David Duke.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.400]  We had pictures of Donald Trump holding hands
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.400]  with Donald Trump.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.400]  We had pictures of David Duke
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.400]  holding hands with Donald Trump.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.400]  This is crazy.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.400]  This is over the top.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.400]  This you can't make up.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.400]  It's just like W,
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.400]  who I was no fan of, kind of fumbled,
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.400]  made some American statements, great job Brownie.
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.400]  You know, they had a FEMA being a
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.400]  Rube, a boob, whatever you want to call him.
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.400]  Didn't know
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:42.400]  what he was doing.
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.400]  Oh, I'm sorry. He was exalted
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.400]  Cyclops. No, no, no. That's only
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.400]  at one level.
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.400]  I haven't looked at it in a while.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.400]  He was the head Grand Dragon for a while.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.400]  Just in general,
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.400]  what is the head of the KKK cult? Okay, I forget.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.400]  It's something like, there's two different
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.400]  names that they can give it.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.400]  When it came time
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.400]  to elect the top official exalted
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.400]  Cyclops in the local clan. Yeah, that's
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.400]  the local guys in Cyclops. I knew that.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.400]  No, no, no. Later he became the big
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.400]  El Supremo. They tried to keep it secret
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.400]  and he later got out supposedly. If you
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.400]  believe that.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.400]  Bottom line, he was a major clan
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.400]  leader.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.400]  But imagine if we had
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.400]  images of David Dick
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.400]  holding hands
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.400]  with Donald Trump.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.400]  We don't have that because it doesn't exist.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.400]  But this we do, Hillary Clinton kissing
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.400]  Robert Byrd and praising him
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.400]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.400]  It's sickening.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.400]  In fact, oh, we just happen to have
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.400]  video of him praising. Here it is right now.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.400]  Here is Hillary at a Freudian slip.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.400]  I said, here we have him praising him.
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.400]  Here we have her
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.400]  praising him.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.400]  Today, our country
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.400]  has lost a true American original.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.400]  My friend and mentor, Robert Seabird.
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.400]  Senator Byrd was a man
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.400]  of surpassing eloquence and
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.400]  nobility. And I will remember
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.400]  him for many things. But most of
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.400]  all, for a heartfelt comment
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.400]  he made to me in the dark days
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.400]  following the attack on our country
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.400]  on 9 11. My state
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.400]  of New York was reeling and we were
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.400]  scrambling to provide support
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.400]  and think of me as
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.400]  the third senator from New York, he said.
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.400]  And he meant it. Think about this.
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:26.400]  Thanks to the leader. She is praising
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.400]  a
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.400]  KKK grand supreme
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.400]  exalted
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.400]  one-eyed, flying purple people leader
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.400]  Grand Dragon, Robert Byrd.
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.400]  I'm sorry, I gotta make fun of these names.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.400]  Because they're like that. And
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.400]  talk about
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.400]  ego trips. I don't give
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.400]  myself CEO of info wars
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.400]  or director or founder.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.400]  And I'm not going to give themselves titles.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:52.400]  I know people that own like ice cream shops
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.400]  they got two employees and they call themselves
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.400]  the CEO.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.400]  But imagine calling yourself
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.400]  grand supreme cyclops.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.400]  What the hell is wrong with these people?
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.400]  I'm sorry. Okay. I'm missing the farce
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.400]  of the trees. I'm just digressing into the weirdness.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.400]  But you've got
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.400]  Robert Byrd, one of the leaders
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.400]  of the KKK
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.400]  and she's in a love fest
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.400]  with him. It's just crazy.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.400]  It's crazy.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.400]  But the main reason I wanted
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.400]  to get our guest on
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.400]  is because
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.400]  he's always got really
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.400]  well researched
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.400]  angles. And I
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:32.400]  always find it to be thought provoking. So he's going to cover the
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.400]  news here with us in the next hour hold
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.400]  a little bit in the next hour. John Rappaport no more
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.400]  fake news.com
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.400]  joins us via Skype. Again, we're a radio show
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.400]  that also summercasts at television.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.400]  If you don't have an affiliate in your area or on cable
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.400]  you can simply go to infowars.com
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.400]  forward slash show
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.400]  and please always share that link with others
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.400]  so they can tune into reality as well.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.400]  This is an info war.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.400]  But I wanted to get him on because he wrote
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.400]  a really good article dealing with the fact that
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.400]  the media is looking at
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.400]  this backwards on purpose
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.400]  making it about did her staff
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:06.400]  ever do favors
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.400]  for money that was given to the foundation?
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.400]  Of course they did. The whole thing's illegal.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.400]  They've got secret bank accounts in like
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.400]  10 different countries. They've got them up in Canada.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.400]  The whole thing's a giant fraud. Some cases
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.400]  people are giving them hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.400]  and then Bill Clinton and
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.400]  she get on airplanes and fly
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.400]  to third world countries to give them uranium
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.400]  concessions. This is
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.400]  you put money into her and then she
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.400]  as the State Department give you
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.400]  US policy instead of standing up
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.400]  and following what Congress says
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.400]  and what the law is. This is total
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.400]  treason. This is her selling
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.400]  on America. This is what globalism is.
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.400]  This is like third world
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.400]  dictators that sit there and take money
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:46.400]  from wealthy corporations or countries
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.400]  to sell their people out. This is her
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.400]  treating us like we're Mexico.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.400]  I gotta say Mexico didn't even let
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.400]  foreign nationals come in.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.400]  Let me pick one that's really been abused
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.400]  by multinationals. Nigeria.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.400]  Argentina.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.400]  China when it was under colonialism.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.400]  We're going to skip somewhere to break the last one of the day.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.400]  This is so incredible
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.400]  and so we're going to break that down.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.400]  We're going to look at the racism stuff.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.400]  This is really a war right now.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.400]  A referendum
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.400]  between the forces
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.400]  that are living in the real world
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.400]  and the forces that are living in fantasy land.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.400]  Because everything they say about Donald Trump is the opposite.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.400]  Now let me be clear.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.400]  I held my nose
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.400]  16 months ago
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:34.400]  and started saying I like Trump more than the others
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.400]  and
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.400]  then as I got to know more about Trump
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.400]  and research team I started thinking this is a good decision
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.400]  so I'm going to start supporting him openly
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.400]  and then as I got to know
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:46.400]  Trump better and I've seen what he's gone through
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.400]  and what he's done, total presidential material
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.400]  and he really hates the new
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.400]  world order. He hates seeing us get screwed over.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.400]  He has a thing
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.400]  about himself being cheated
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.400]  and he doesn't like it.
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.400]  So he identifies with the Republic.
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.400]  He wants to be the turnaround guy that
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.400]  saves the Republic.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.400]  He wants to be beyond Nigel Farage
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.400]  and I totally get it.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.400]  The guy has a big ego. That's good.
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.400]  The guy's a man. He's aggressive.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.400]  He is
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.400]  dangerous at some level
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.400]  like any man that world leaders would actually
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:20.400]  have respect for. That means fear.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.400]  But he is
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:26.400]  the polar opposite
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.400]  of the weak,
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.400]  sniveling, backstabbing, corrupt
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.400]  wicked establishment
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.400]  Hillary of decade after decade
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.400]  and we'd be out there on the streets
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.400]  in Austin and other areas. We played the clubs
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.400]  and we say to people
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:42.400]  well who are you supporting
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.400]  and they'll say I'm not supporting Trump
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.400]  you know the unemployment, the government
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.400]  and all the bad things that have gone on
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.400]  and the establishment and we'll say to people we go
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.400]  but Hillary is part of the establishment.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.400]  I don't care, I'm four.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.400]  No logic, twisted
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.400]  mindlessness.
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.400]  I mean the entire power structure, foreign
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.400]  governments, world leaders,
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.400]  every criminal organization you can imagine
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.400]  hates Donald Trump. That's not reverse psychology.
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.400]  They're cheating in the polls. He's not getting
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.400]  any of the big corporate money.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.400]  If he started getting a bunch of big corporate money
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.400]  I'd be a little concerned. No, it's like he's getting nothing.
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.400]  And then I'm sure
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.400]  that we're seeing history. Don't
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:22.400]  just think that there's only evil in the world.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.400]  It's always darkest
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.400]  before the dawn.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.400]  That's how it works. For every action
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.400]  there's an opposite and equal reaction. This is universal law
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.400]  people and so Trump is a
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.400]  manifestation, a figurehead of us
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.400]  of that energy. That's why
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.400]  when you get near-Trump rallies or near-Trump
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.400]  I'm just remembering
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.400]  I am higher than I am.
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.400]  I am electrified right now.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.400]  Whoa! Oh my
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:48.400]  God, this is incredible.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:50.400]  This is what freedom feels like. This is
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.400]  what getting the new order off our back in this
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.400]  spiritual blanket of evil.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.400]  Ugh!
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.400]  And let me tell you, no matter what happens to Trump
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.400]  we're winning. Don't let them spin this if they kill him
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.400]  or steal the election from them. Ah, you're discredited.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.400]  Your movement's discredited. They're giving us the fake
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.400]  script to follow. That's not what this is.
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.400]  This is a drowning man battling
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.400]  for the surface and gasping. We may not make it
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:12.400]  the first time. We may get a lung full of water.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.400]  Alright, John Rappaport
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.400]  is our guest. NoMoreFakeNews.com
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.400]  I've thrown out a lot there. Got a lot of news
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.400]  to cover, a lot of clips. I need to get you on
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.400]  more often because you're so good at jumping around
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.400]  moving quick with me, John Rappaport.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.400]  I've thrown a lot of issues out here.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.400]  You write about them all eloquently.
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.400]  Do you agree with what I just said about Trump?
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.400]  Let's talk about the energy, the phenomenon.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.400]  I don't know what you're going to say. I want to hear it.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.400]  The listeners and viewers do.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.400]  And where all this is going. And then let's
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.400]  go through these issue by issue by issue.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.400]  But are we not entering the crucible?
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:44.400]  Are we not entering the true crossroads?
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.400]  A massive
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:48.400]  decision in the future
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.400]  of humanity. Because forget Trump.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.400]  Isn't he, just like
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.400]  Farage of UKIP and the Brexit,
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.400]  isn't this a referendum
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.400]  against the media and against the establishment
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.400]  as Trump has said?
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.400]  No question about it, Alex.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.400]  It's the people behind
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.400]  Trump
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.400]  to the side of Trump
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.400]  in front of Trump, around Trump.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:12.400]  It's the populist
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.400]  movement where
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.400]  people are putting their eggs in that basket
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.400]  and saying, okay, look,
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.400]  we don't know necessarily about this guy.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.400]  We don't know everything about him.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.400]  We're going to see what happens.
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.400]  But
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.400]  the ideas and the energy
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.400]  are things that we,
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.400]  the people have been talking about for a long time.
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.400]  Destroying globalism.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.400]  Jobs leaving
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.400]  in America. Bring them back.
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.400]  Trying to
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:42.400]  figure out
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.400]  how come all these people are coming into the country
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.400]  and there's no limit on it.
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.400]  No ceiling.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.400]  And nobody's saying that there's ever going to be
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:52.400]  a ceiling.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.400]  And then we get the Dorsoros emails
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.400]  and it's admitted to make us poor
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.400]  and actually divide us and create racism.
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.400]  Sorry, go ahead. Exactly.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.400]  Yeah, that's the whole idea.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.400]  And many of us have been seeing this for a long time.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.400]  Okay, so this is an operation.
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.400]  This is a covert out.
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.400]  The idea is to overwhelm the country
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.400]  with so many people coming in
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.400]  for so many different reasons
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.400]  and all claiming
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.400]  that now we are the savior of the world.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.400]  And so we're going to have
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:22.400]  six, seven billion people living here
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.400]  because that's what America ought to do.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.400]  And if they just back off
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.400]  and they don't do it and they refuse anybody
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.400]  coming in for any reason,
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.400]  then we're completely racist.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.400]  So we see through all that crap
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.400]  and people have been seeing through it for a long time.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.400]  And we see through the whole
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.400]  inner city destruction
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.400]  that's happening with globalism.
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.400]  Hey, guess what? All of a sudden,
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:46.400]  there's no jobs left.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.400]  There's no work left.
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.400]  All these manufacturing jobs have fled the country
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.400]  because they're allowed to
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.400]  because they can go to some hellhole
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.400]  in the third world, produce the same goods,
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.400]  export them back here
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.400]  and all of a sudden they don't have to pay any tariffs.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.400]  No taxes, no penalties, no nothing.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.400]  And that's how the globalist game works.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.400]  And if there were tariffs,
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.400]  those companies would be destroyed
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.400]  unless they came back here
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.400]  and so Trump is talking about that.
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.400]  So for me,
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.400]  I'm not a mind reader in the sense
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.400]  that I'm willing to go out and say,
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.400]  I know who this guy is.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.400]  I know exactly what he really means
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:24.400]  and I know exactly what he's going to do
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.400]  because frankly, I don't.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.400]  But what I do know is that the energy
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:30.400]  and the spirit and the ideas
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:32.400]  behind this whole movement,
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.400]  which really, if you go back
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.400]  where a lot of the same ideas around Ron Paul,
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.400]  who didn't have the energy
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.400]  and the muscle and the appeal immediately,
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.400]  that's what I'm talking about.
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.400]  That's right. And Trump knows this
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.400]  and he's punching through the media and they know it.
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.400]  And so regardless of what happens here,
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.400]  this is a war. We have torn the hell
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:54.400]  out of the New World Order.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.400]  We have brought so much more energy in.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:58.400]  You can see the next wave of liberty is going to be even bigger.
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.400]  The New World Order,
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.400]  I believe is bleeding to death right now
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.400]  and is doomed.
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.400]  The problem is, will it drag us down with it
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:08.400]  in its death rows? And that could take decades.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.400]  Yeah.
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.400]  And bringing up the media, that's crucial
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.400]  because one of the major things
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.400]  that Trump has done is he said,
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.400]  you know, I don't care what you guys are saying.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.400]  What do I care?
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.400]  You're all crazy. You're all sold out.
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:24.400]  You're criminals. You don't know what you're talking about.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.400]  You're dumb. You're idiots.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.400]  And that's the end of it.
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.400]  And all of a sudden, millions of people in America
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.400]  just stand up and say, well, that's what we thought.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.400]  We've been thinking about that for a long time
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:36.400]  because we watch the news every night
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.400]  and we see how crooked these people are
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:40.400]  and how stupid and incompetent
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.400]  and how they're sold out
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.400]  and so forth.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.400]  Now, if he brought nothing to the table
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.400]  except that, if Trump
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.400]  brought nothing except that,
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.400]  that would be a major victory to me.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:54.400]  I mean, an incredibly major victory, I'm saying as a reporter
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.400]  because the whole idea now
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.400]  is people say, well, you know,
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.400]  I don't have to buy what the media is saying.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.400]  I know they're crooked.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.400]  I don't care what they say.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.400]  They can spin their lives forever
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.400]  and we don't have to believe them.
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.400]  In fact, we'll just reject them out of hand
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.400]  and forget these people
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.400]  because, you know, they're just part
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.400]  of the same establishment
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.400]  that's trying to destroy us.
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.400]  Let me ask you this, Rapaport.
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.400]  Obviously, they've been cheating on the polls.
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.400]  They admit they've changed the methodology
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:26.400]  on most of them.
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.400]  They know more Democrats
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.400]  or they add a bunch of independents
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.400]  they know are really Democrats
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.400]  or they call the phone lines
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.400]  people that they know are Democrats
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.400]  and sample them as Republicans.
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.400]  This is all, I can't believe they actually
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.400]  put it in their methodology
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.400]  like it makes it okay, like the Republicans going,
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.400]  well, we change the rules where we ignore
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.400]  the popular vote, the primary.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.400]  Well, so what if you change the rules?
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.400]  The election laws say one person, one vote.
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.400]  That's why they had to back off
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:56.400]  the internal polls I know have been done.
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:58.400]  Trump is still ahead in some of these battlegrounds
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.400]  but it's gotten closer because of that hoax
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.400]  that Trump's in trouble.
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:04.400]  So the self-fulfilling prophecy,
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.400]  how do we counter that and how effective
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:08.400]  do you think it's been?
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.400]  I think it's been very effective.
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.400]  I think people are waking up about the polls.
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:14.400]  I mean, I looked on the Reuters page the other day
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:16.400]  and I saw two stories,
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.400]  one above the other,
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.400]  that were like two or three days apart
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.400]  and the first story said,
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.400]  this was Reuters, you know, Trump
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.400]  weighed down in the polls and the second story
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:28.400]  said, he pulled even.
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.400]  He pulled even. I mean, you know,
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:32.400]  you just look at that and you say,
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.400]  these people are lying, they're crazy.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.400]  CNN does the same thing.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.400]  All these media outlets, they're scrambling
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.400]  and people are seeing it, that the polls
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:42.400]  are completely rigged, that they don't
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.400]  make any sense.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.400]  What we really have to worry about
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.400]  is Hillary's theft of the election.
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.400]  I mean outright theft through.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.400]  It's smart that Trump has put that front and center
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.400]  so people understand and then they come out and say,
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:56.400]  we've never heard of this.
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.400]  Obama says, what's that?
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.400]  What's election fraud? That's ridiculous. That's the quote.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.400]  But then they admit the Justice Department's
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.400]  putting five times more monitors
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.400]  out there to make sure illegals can vote.
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:08.400]  They're there to help the retail fraud.
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:10.400]  And the UN's putting
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.400]  ten times
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.400]  the international observers in they've ever done.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:16.400]  That's Reuters, by the way.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.400]  I wish you would get Bev Harris on there.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.400]  We're trying.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:22.400]  I haven't been able to really.
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.400]  I've gotten a few quotes from her.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.400]  But I mean blackboxvoting.org.
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.400]  She's deeply
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.400]  investigating this system called GEMS.
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.400]  G-E-M-S.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.400]  And what she's talking about,
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.400]  this is a software vote tabulating program
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.400]  that is responsible
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.400]  for counting 25%
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.400]  of the votes across America.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.400]  25%.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.400]  And it is embedded
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.400]  in
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.400]  five different voting
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.400]  machine manufacturers.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.400]  All the ones that people have heard about,
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.400]  Diabold, etc., etc.
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.400]  And this thing can take a vote, one vote,
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.400]  and it can turn it into 50 votes.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.400]  You know, you go into the booth,
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.400]  you make one vote,
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.400]  and suddenly becomes 50
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:08.400]  if the people who are manipulating it
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.400]  want it to be.
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:12.400]  And they preset the algorithm where it's all preset
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.400]  for exactly the outcome they're going to have.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.400]  And you, when they were still in the primary
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.400]  from Sanders in California,
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:20.400]  they met the day before with CNN
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.400]  and AP with the super PAC
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.400]  people and the
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.400]  super delegates.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.400]  And they said, we have decided this is who's going to win.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.400]  This is the number. They decided
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.400]  set the number for the next day, let everybody vote,
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.400]  and then announce the winner.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.400]  But they admitted they did it like it's okay.
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:38.400]  We admit we met
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.400]  and stole it from Bernie. It's this weirdness
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:42.400]  where they have the Republicans go on
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.400]  TV and go, we never take your popular vote.
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.400]  We're going to, we're going to decide.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:48.400]  See, I mean, it's, it's mind control.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.400]  It's a Jedi mind trick, folks.
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.400]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.400]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:56.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.400]  Radio Network.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.400]  I know there's a lot of smoke,
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:06.400]  and there's no fire.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.400]  There's AC reports.
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.400]  Smoke but no fire.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:12.400]  All the fireworks on the 4th of July weekend.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.400]  You may have missed the news that under
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.400]  oath, Huma Abedin admitted
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.400]  that Hillary burned at least some
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.400]  of her schedules as Secretary of State.
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.400]  Yeah, schedules in the
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.400]  burn bag. That may explain
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.400]  why she stonewalled the Associated Press
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:28.400]  for three years to stop her schedules
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:30.400]  from being seen, to show the pay
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.400]  for play.
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.400]  Richard Grinnell, former diplomat
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:36.400]  said, I spent eight years
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.400]  at the State Department and watched as four
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.400]  U.S. ambassadors and two secretaries
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.400]  of state shared their daily schedules
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.400]  with a variety of State Department employees
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:46.400]  and U.S. officials. I've never seen anyone
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:48.400]  put their schedule in the burn bag
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.400]  because every one of them had a
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:52.400]  state.gov email address.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.400]  Therefore, their daily schedules became
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:56.400]  public records as required
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.400]  by law. I know there's a lot of smoke
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:00.400]  and there's no fire. David Nitro

[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:32.400]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.400]  because I'm going back on it today.

[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.400]  infoworslif.com. Thank you, Dr. Group
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.400]  from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.400]  for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.400]  Thank you so much.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.400]  Thank you so much.
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.400]  Thank you so much.
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:56.400]  Thank you so much.
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.400]  Thank you so much.
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.400]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:30.400]  Thank you so much.
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:00.400]  Thank you.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:28.400]  Thank you.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.400]  Thank you, sir.
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:38.400]  Thank you.
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:44.400]  Thank you, sir.
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.400]  Thank you, sir.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:56.400]  We're interrupting your regularly scheduled program to bring you this terrifying report.
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:01.400]  It was almost as if it were a planned infusion, it just pancaked.
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:05.400]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:10.400]  New York very much a city still in chaos, the phones are not working properly,
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:12.400]  the subway lines are not working properly.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:17.400]  The sky now black with smoke in front of us just across the Tigris River here.
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:22.400]  This is shock and awe Tom, the population of Baghdad.
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:24.400]  Shock and awe indeed.
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:30.400]  The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:34.400]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:36.400]  Come on.
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:40.400]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:45.400]  I love my dad. I'd kill for him. I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:46.400]  I love Bill Clinton.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.400]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:50.400]  My sister-in-law.
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:56.400]  When you are subverting the power of government, that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.400]  What do you think of Edward Snowden?
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:34:59.400]  I think he's a traitor.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:03.400]  Obama is the one that kills the US troops if the Russians bomb any of them.
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:05.400]  Obama is the one that put him in arms way.
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.400]  Obama is the one using him as human shields.
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:12.400]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:16.400]  I'm here to warn people. You keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game.
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.400]  Welcome to America. This is what we do.
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:27.400]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:30.400]  We're armed to the teeth and we're not scared. You got that, you sons of bitches?
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:33.400]  In 2012, your agency was saying, quote,
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:39.400]  the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:44.400]  In 2012, the US was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups.
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:45.400]  And why did you not stop that?
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:48.400]  Why didn't you come forward before? What were you waiting for?
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:52.400]  Well, for you, Inspector, I needed you.
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:36:04.400]  I suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected. We're all part of it.
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.400]  Are we ready for it?
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.400]  All right.
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:16.400]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:26.400]  We aired that longer intro right there because Governor Jesse Ventura really wanted to talk to me.
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:30.400]  And he's usually not like, hey, Alex, call me right away. So I called him right away.
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:34.400]  And my gosh, for the three minute break and the three minute little promo intro,
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:45.400]  I've never heard him so on fire, but focused. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals just refused with no comment to hear his case.
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:51.400]  And folks, I want to make something clear. I admire our soldiers, even if some of these wars are corrupt or bad.
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:59.400]  And I admire Navy Seals and folks, and I know a lot of them, and Green Berets and Army Special Forces, everybody knows that.
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:04.400]  But I'm against all these wars. And I don't like it in the middle of the Chris Kyle Jesse Ventura thing.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:10.400]  But the jury saw the evidence and the judge ruled in favor. Ventura is not doing this for money.
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:17.400]  He's not doing this to get money from Chris Kyle's widow who I've seen on TV and really great Second Amendment woman.
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:24.400]  Amazing. The truth is, this was some bigger Psyop. I don't think she was involved. Kyle got executed.
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:32.400]  I've talked to Navy Seals. I've talked to famous operators that guard world leaders, you name it.
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:37.400]  It's known he was executed up outside Dallas for some reason. There's something big here. They're really scared of it.
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:47.400]  National securities come into it. This is really dangerous stuff for Ventura because the court even violated his own rules.
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:52.400]  His lawyer is one of the top ones in the country. Ventura has won a lot of lawsuits with him. He says he's never seen anything like this.
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:38:01.400]  When Ventura comes on exclusively Monday, I got to call him back today to get filled in on more of it, they're hiding something bigger.
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:08.400]  Forget Chris Kyle. Forget his wife, all that stuff. And this was done to discredit Ventura so he couldn't run for president later.
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:16.400]  And regardless of what you think about Ventura, this was a Psyop. And then Kyle had to be taken out to cover it up.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:23.400]  Just like they did with other famous military people that were used for PR purposes. It's very, very dangerous.
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:30.400]  Remember what happened with the football player and everything in Afghanistan? Remember what happened with Private Lynch with that fake story?
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:34.400]  They killed five members of her team in one week when they started speaking out saying it was fake.
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:45.400]  Jerry Bruckheimer actually directed it in the field with SAP cameras. That's the one in Guardian. That was all made up, fake.
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:52.400]  I mean, there was a real attack. She cowered. The men were the ones that fought and got killed and some got captured.
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.400]  The point is they want to put women in the military in frontline combat. It's all just PRBS.
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:05.400]  And so I've seen these things with Pat Tillman, you name it, where they kill them. And this is dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous stuff.
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:21.400]  And I'm very sad for Chris Kyle and his wife, but the big news is, and I'm going to go to our guest, but this is really big, that they were getting up there,
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:30.400]  testifying that Ventura was taking money in the lawsuit from her, even though he spent as much on the lawsuit as he was going to get.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:38.400]  And ladies and gentlemen, I just can't even believe it. I can't believe it was such a twilight zone world.
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:49.400]  They were all testifying that it was her money, even though they had this $50 million insurance policy that would have covered it, you know, 10 times over.
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:56.400]  And the federal court overturned it and said they don't want that known.
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:04.400]  Think about that. They don't want it known. They want to just keep pushing the fraud that Jesse Ventura is shooing a widow to get her personal money, all of it bull.
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:10.400]  And she's made more than 30 million bucks herself. Again, I don't want to get into the whole middle of this thing. It's just crazy.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:16.400]  Ventura is asking for a couple million dollars. They hurt that got bad with that made up story.
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:21.400]  And that's what Chris Kyle or whoever got for adding that little piece of bull in that book.
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:26.400]  So I've talked to folks that were there, Navy Seals and Army people that were the new Chris Kyle.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:29.400]  And they said, no, that movie is pretty accurate. In fact, he probably killed more people than that.
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:32.400]  There's other guys in the Army that have killed more than Chris Kyle, by the way.
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:40.400]  But again, that's though it's a whole other area where they've allowed the Navy Seals to engage in PR propaganda stuff.
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:43.400]  And there's a reason the Army's never allowed it. It's super dangerous.
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:47.400]  And you see where all this stuff goes. But I'm going to stop right there because he told me even more.
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:53.400]  It's like at a certain point, I'm like, people think they want to lead an exciting life.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:58.400]  And I always wanted to lead an exciting life. But man, this is getting a little too exciting because it doesn't stop.
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:01.400]  It doesn't let up. The crescendo is intensifying.
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:03.400]  All right, co-hosting with us. That's what he's doing.
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:08.400]  Riding shotgun is Mr. Rappaport from NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:11.400]  And we're going to go to him here in just a moment.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:20.400]  I want to tell the listeners, I want to tell the viewers that we have come out with another amazing supplement at infowarslife.com.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:30.400]  And it is our goal and it is our pledge and it is our commitment to bring you the highest quality, most bioavailable, organic products out there.
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:37.400]  Selenium is so important to the body. It's a missing link, a missing element that most people are very deficient in.
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:44.400]  It's how your cells engage in electrochemical activity from the brain to every other cell in the body, in particular the brain.
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:47.400]  Reproduction, all of it. It is king.
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:50.400]  And that's why they keep lowering the amount they say you need.
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.400]  Just like they tell you, you don't need iodine, even though you'll die without it.
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:57.400]  The feds used to put it in the salt, folks. It raised IQ point 15%.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:02.400]  And this goes with the X2 from infowarslife.com, like a horse and carriage.
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:07.400]  It goes with infowarslife.com, or call toll free, triple eight, two five three, three one, three nine.
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.400]  Triple eight, two five three, three one, three nine.
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:12.400]  I think we got like 26 nutraceuticals now.
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:15.400]  And some of them are very proprietary and very complex.
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:22.400]  Game changers, others are just the best of absolute staples.
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:23.400]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:30.400]  And I am so honored to be working with Dr. Group and other top developers to bring you everything from the most bioavailable,
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:34.400]  bottom of the B12, Mythical Bodleman, secret 12, to the lung cleanse, to all of it.
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:38.400]  Okay, Mr. Rappaport, again, I want to go into analysis with you.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:42.400]  We've talked about the state of the world, where we are, what's happening in the courts,
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:45.400]  what's happening in the media, this huge consolidation.
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:50.400]  Hillary openly fundraising with emails saying we're going to shut down the independent press when I get in,
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:52.400]  that they don't have a right to exist.
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:56.400]  These are unprecedented statements that Drudge warned of last year.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:59.400]  What would you call the climate in the world right now?
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:01.400]  Geopolitically, where the world is.
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:04.400]  Why are the elites so naked, so brazen right now?
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:07.400]  And then let's go through her health records.
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:09.400]  Let's go through the foundation.
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:15.400]  Let's go through the other big issues you've been writing about so eloquently at NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:17.400]  John Rappaport.
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:22.400]  We're seeing the extreme polarization, which has been coming for a long time.
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:31.400]  Freedom versus slavery, basically, is what it is. Individual freedom. Does a person exist as an individual?
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:33.400]  This is something I write about forever.
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:38.400]  I mean, there are sociologists out there, Alex, and I've quoted them before,
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:44.400]  that say basically the individual is some kind of an extinct concept that never really existed.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:54.400]  I mean, these people are just infesting universities and journals, their agents, their covert agents,
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:59.400]  and they're trying to destroy freedom, and the very basis goes back to the individual.
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:00.400]  That's what they're after.
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:03.400]  The group is everything. What group do you belong to?
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:07.400]  You've got to find your group, and it's got to have a special need,
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:12.400]  and you've got to be a victim, and you've got to be talking about what other people are doing to you.
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:18.400]  That's your only ticket in this world now. That's all you can do.
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:24.400]  Join up, find the right group, find their language, find their words, parrot their stories.
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:29.400]  You're a member of a group. You don't really exist independently.
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:32.400]  When in fact, of course, the Republic was all about that.
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:36.400]  The Republic existed to limit government right from the beginning.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:40.400]  We know that this is where the seat of corruption starts.
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:42.400]  So we're going to limit what they can do.
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:49.400]  That was overturned, you know, gradually a few hours after the ink was dry in the documents,
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:51.400]  but the ideas are there.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:55.400]  And now what we're dealing with is polarization.
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:45:01.400]  And again, to get back to Trump, what he represents, whether you believe it as a real person
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:07.400]  or as a symbol or whatever, is a coalescing around that campaign of people who are saying,
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:14.400]  wait a minute, this is not a world of, I've got to save everybody in the world
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:18.400]  and this is my mission in life because somebody taught me that in a university
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:21.400]  and I have no life for existence of my own.
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:25.400]  That's complete crap. I'm not going for that.
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:30.400]  That's PR. That's a PSYOP. That's the way they drag you in.
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:34.400]  That's the way they say, well, look, everybody in the world has to be saved
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:38.400]  and we, your leaders, are the Jesus Christ who are going to do this
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:43.400]  and we need you to help us and if you don't, you're a corrupt criminal terrorist,
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:46.400]  outsider, threat, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:50.400]  So this is total mind control. This is giving up your identity and becoming a slave
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:56.400]  and your profession is how to be a disempowered crybaby.
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:58.400]  That's right. That's your profession.
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:07.400]  So here come all the violent protests and so forth in the United States against police violence,
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:09.400]  which of course does exist.
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:15.400]  But the thing about these protests and the violence and so forth is that they are a smokescreen.
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:20.400]  They're pretending this is what's wrong with the inner cities in America.
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:22.400]  This is the real problem is police violence.
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:27.400]  If we could solve this somehow, everything else would go away. That's total bullshit.
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:30.400]  What's actually happening in inner cities for a long time,
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:35.400]  $2 trillion perhaps more since 1966 on the war on poverty.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:37.400]  Where has it gone? What has it done?
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:40.400]  Things are worse now than they've ever been before.
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:44.400]  It's been weaponized to make them disenfranchise as a beta test
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.400]  and now it's being moved everywhere globally.
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:51.400]  Absolutely, a dastardly total plan to ship the jobs out
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:58.400]  and then scapegoat the cops that you throw in in a rearguard action as the civilization collapses.
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:46:59.400]  Exactly.
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:03.400]  And then of course, if you want to talk about Second Amendment and guns,
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:06.400]  and let's say you had somebody sane in the White House,
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:09.400]  the first thing they would do is they would stand up with a global press conference
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:12.400]  and they would have a big board and they would say,
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:15.400]  you know what I'm going to do to curb gun violence?
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:19.400]  I'm going to show you where most of it is happening and who's doing it.
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:21.400]  Wouldn't you think that's a plan?
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:25.400]  If you want to eliminate gun violence, let's find out where it's happening.
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:27.400]  So it's here, it's in this city, it's in that city.
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:31.400]  Here we go, folks, and who are the people that are doing most of it?
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:34.400]  Well, we call them, what's that word again?
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:38.400]  Gangs. That's right. We forgot all about that.
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:45.400]  How many times has Obama or Bush or even Clinton talked about that word in depth?
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:50.400]  Never. What's going on there? Well, they're part of the drug cartel operation.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:54.400]  We can't disturb that because I mean, they're distributing heroin and cocaine
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:58.400]  and so forth all over the country for the Mexican cartels and other cartels.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:01.400]  Ooh, we better not. But that's where the violence is happening.
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:04.400]  And that's the real total racism with the Democrats.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.400]  Republicans involved as well, but they're the real quarterbacks
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:10.400]  in all those Democrat-controlled cities with Bill Clinton and Mina Arkansas
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:13.400]  bringing the cocaine in on record to bring it in
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:16.400]  and then have minimum sentencing when the black people use it.
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:20.400]  I mean, wow, she really did sit at the feet of Grand Dragon commander.
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:24.400]  You bet. So they're destroying the inner cities
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:26.400]  and then they're coming out and saying,
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:30.400]  okay, you can see from our protests that the real problem,
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:34.400]  the only problem is cop violence in the inner cities.
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:39.400]  Come on, man. You know, I mean, I could go on, you know, for hours about this.
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:45.400]  This is all a smokescreen. Nobody in any administration in the White House
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:51.400]  since Lyndon Johnson certainly and before ever wanted to really solve
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:54.400]  the problem of what's going on in inner cities.
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:57.400]  It's all a scythe. It's all meant to destroy inner cities,
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:01.400]  to create chaos, to create this bigger vortex
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:06.400]  that will suck everybody in the country down into it through guilt, shame,
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:10.400]  new laws. And now under Agenda 21, they are going to force everyone
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:15.400]  to move into the compact cities or move poverty into little central cities
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:18.400]  with little skyscrapers right in the middle of small towns
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:24.400]  like a invasion to then bring that scourge there.
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:27.400]  They admit this plan. Exactly.
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:30.400]  It's like, okay, this is what we're going to do, folks.
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:35.400]  And you can't say anything about it because if you do, then you're a racist.
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:37.400]  Racism has nothing to do with this.
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:41.400]  This is a scythe, a covert op, the destruction of populations,
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:46.400]  the destruction of areas, bringing chaos to the entire country
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:50.400]  with the idea of destroying the entire country and erecting on it
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:55.400]  that little clip of Elder George Bush, a new world order.
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:56.400]  That's the whole point.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:59.400]  And now we have all the emails and more coming
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:02.400]  where it's from George Soros and Hillary and everybody
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:05.400]  sending people dressed like Bernie supporters to attack Trump
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:08.400]  to blame Trump and Sanders, her co-enemies.
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:11.400]  Sending in the radical Muslims to bring down Europe
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:13.400]  and admitting it's a disabilization program.
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:16.400]  We have the smoking guns.
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:18.400]  It's absolutely there.
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:22.400]  And then in one that has to be the strangest presidential season
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:25.400]  that I've ever seen, and I'm 78 years old,
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:28.400]  here you had, no matter what you think of them, forget that for the moment,
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:31.400]  on one side you have this guy named Bernie Sanders,
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:33.400]  over here you have this guy, Trump.
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:37.400]  Now you listen to them talking about globalism and the effects
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:41.400]  and basically you're hearing the same story from both of them.
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:44.400]  But they both hate each other and they can't stand each other
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:48.400]  and they're standing on the extremes talking about globalism.
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:53.400]  And here comes up the highway center stripe in a big limo,
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:56.400]  the biggest globalist in America, Hillary Clinton,
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:58.400]  hoping to drive her way into the White House.
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:01.400]  Absolutely straight there, John Rappaport, a total genius.

[01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:08.400]  Will our next president lead us to prosperity and peace?
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:10.400]  Or will it all fall apart?
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:13.400]  Our modern world is unpredictable and unstable.
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:15.400]  Do you want to see what comes next?
[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:16.400]  What if the worst happens?

[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:26.400]  I was sitting here during the break.
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:31.400]  I was thinking about a couple things.
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:35.400]  And one of them is, I'm saying this is a foreign globalist takeover
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:38.400]  and Hillary and the Pope and all of these other world leaders
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:40.400]  are saying it's a world takeover as well.
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:44.400]  But they say we're liberal, so we need a liberal world government
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:46.400]  that's going to give free stuff to the third world.
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:48.400]  They've been exploiting the whole time.
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:50.400]  I mean, these are the exploiters.
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:54.400]  You can say we passively do it as well by supporting things that aren't
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:59.400]  free trade, fair trade, research trade, compassionate trade.
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:03.400]  And I'm all about actually paying people more in the third world
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:05.400]  so it doesn't suck us down as well and builds them up.
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:08.400]  That's how you help people is actually equitably building real things,
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:10.400]  not just exploiting them.
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:12.400]  But that's Henry Ford, a bad guy in some ways,
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:15.400]  but he said I want to be able to have my employees buy the car.
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:17.400]  I actually want to build an economy.
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:20.400]  The globalists are having a system where they're ending the economy,
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:23.400]  where they tell Africa you can't have cars, you can't have this stuff.
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:26.400]  But I saw a John Bowne report this morning.
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:30.400]  He filed for info wars and he was saying being anti-Trump is treason
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:34.400]  or being a anti-Trump protester is basically treason.
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:36.400]  I thought, is that too strong?
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:38.400]  But then I started thinking about it.
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:41.400]  If people were working, say for the Chinese or the Russians en masse
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:44.400]  and they were trying to block roads and overthrow things
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:46.400]  and stop a presidential candidate,
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:48.400]  they would have foreign interference
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:51.400]  and if a citizen did it, it would be treason.
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:54.400]  Well, these are globalist systems that are doing this.
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:58.400]  This is world government and so it really is treason.
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:01.400]  And then they've used our open system to come in,
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:03.400]  turn our citizens against us,
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:05.400]  and actually become operative.
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:08.400]  John Rappaport, please continue.
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:11.400]  It's a global operation.
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:13.400]  It's a globalist operation.
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:15.400]  It comes from all over the world.
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:18.400]  I mean, you cover Bilderberg more than anybody else.
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:22.400]  What are these guys doing sitting in castles and hotels and so forth
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:24.400]  from all over the world?
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:27.400]  Big shots, heavy hitters, bankers and so forth.
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:31.400]  They're planning the future and in this future, people are slaves.
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:33.400]  That's the way it is.
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:35.400]  They don't want freedom.
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:37.400]  You think they're sitting around saying,
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:39.400]  you know, we want to liberate the individual.
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:41.400]  This is the most important thing in the world, boys.
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.400]  I mean, let's face it, we're all individuals.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:46.400]  And so what we really want to do is liberate the individual all over the world.
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:48.400]  Yeah, sure. That's what they're doing.
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:51.400]  Why are they all sitting there and meeting in the first place?
[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:54.400]  Because they're planning the future.
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:57.400]  I mean, this concept in itself is destructive.
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:00.400]  We're going to plan the future of the planet.
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:02.400]  Really? Well, who are you?
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:04.400]  10 billion people?
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.400]  All this giant globe?
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:09.400]  You're the one who you're planning the future.
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:11.400]  Wow. Where do you get that idea from?
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:14.400]  Well, the idea we get is that the individual human being
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:18.400]  is a biological machine that's out of control and is misprogrammed
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:21.400]  and we have to reprogram him and that's what we're doing.
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:26.400]  So shut up and let it happen because that's where science is really going
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:29.400]  and that's what we're doing and this is the future.
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.400]  That's really the basis of the whole thing.
[01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:35.400]  And that's the globalist admitted statement at the mid-level,
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:38.400]  not for proletariat consumption, but at the higher level,
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:42.400]  it's to poison us, kill us, phase us out and we see under their management
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:46.400]  they are directly donning us down and poisoning us.
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:50.400]  Yes. And they also seem to believe that,
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:53.400]  well, a robot can do your job better than you can
[01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:55.400]  and the robot will always follow directions.
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:57.400]  So what do we need you for?
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:57:59.400]  They're psychopaths. They're saying we don't have a right to exist.
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:03.400]  Exactly. It's the system that they're interested in.
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:06.400]  And I've been writing about this for years.
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:10.400]  People who are obsessed by systems, watch out.
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:12.400]  When a person is obsessed,
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:15.400]  okay, we have to impose this system and that system
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:18.400]  and then that system is under this even bigger system
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:20.400]  and that will save us all.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:24.400]  That person is a psycho. That person is a psychopath.
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:26.400]  That's right. It's the number one hallmark.
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:29.400]  Look at Hitler, how he loved all the marching parades and all that
[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:31.400]  and I mean, that's what they're into.
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:35.400]  They're into black uniforms. They're into rallies at night with fire.
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:38.400]  They're into pyramids where children are sacrificed.
[01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:41.400]  It's always the same spirit. We'll be back. Stay with us.
[01:58:41.400 --> 01:59:03.400]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:14.400]  If you're dealing with a health challenge

[01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:20.400]  and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate

[02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:19.400]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide.
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:22.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:24.400]  You know, I think John Rappaport,
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:27.400]  of all of our amazing guests that are challenged in different ways,
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:31.400]  is the smoothest, most concise person laying out
[02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:34.400]  the globalist's true intentions from their own admissions.
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:37.400]  That's why I turn into a stuttering, stammering mess.
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:39.400]  Not because I don't have stuff to stay
[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:41.400]  or I'm in deer on the headlights.
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:43.400]  I'm just like, there's all these documents.
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:46.400]  There's all this proof. These people are bad news.
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:49.400]  And they talk about how the future doesn't need us.
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:52.400]  And even Bill Joy, I've been talking about this for 16 years.
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:54.400]  He writes a big cover story for Wired Magazine,
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:56.400]  co-owner of Sun Microsystems.
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:58.400]  I think it was worth $4 billion at the time.
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:00:59.400]  It's like $10 billion now.
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:01.400]  He says, yeah, go to these big conferences
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:03.400]  and we've decided to kill everybody.
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:06.400]  And I think the public should be warned.
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:08.400]  So some of these guys have a heart
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:10.400]  and they're like trying to warn us,
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:13.400]  the general public's already been so dumbed down.
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:15.400]  There is an awakening happening.
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:17.400]  In the five minutes we have left, John Rabaport,
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:18.400]  I appreciate your time.
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:20.400]  Other things you'd like to talk about,
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:24.400]  your articles, a couple little factoids on that,
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:27.400]  with the foundation, how they're trying to spin that,
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:29.400]  where you see all this going, Hillary's health.
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:31.400]  What are your observations?
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:34.400]  Well, as far as the foundation is concerned,
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:36.400]  the latest article that I wrote about Hillary
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:38.400]  is that the needy has the backwards.
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:43.400]  Look, the Secretary of State is a side gig.
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:45.400]  Get that straight, okay?
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:49.400]  She is one of the officers of the Clinton Foundation.
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:52.400]  It's not that as Secretary of State
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:56.400]  she's found accidentally or incidentally ways
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:02:01.400]  to enrich the foundation through these pay-for-play schemes
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:03.400]  and donations and all of that.
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:07.400]  No, the Secretary of State job is a branch office
[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:09.400]  of the Clinton Foundation.
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:11.400]  That's where she lives.
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:14.400]  And this was a great gig to get, a real prize,
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:18.400]  because it allowed her to expand the foundation
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:20.400]  to bring in billions of dollars.
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:23.400]  Money, money, money, money, crime, crime, crime, crime.
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:25.400]  The Clintons can't resist it.
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:26.400]  They always do it.
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:28.400]  And that's the whole thing.
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:30.400]  The media are talking about it backwards.
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:32.400]  She is the Clinton Foundation.
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:37.400]  The Secretary of State is a side gig
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:41.400]  that she managed to worm out of Obama for herself
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:44.400]  to enable her to enrich her family.
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:46.400]  It's mafia time.
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:48.400]  It's all about the family, folks.
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:50.400]  That's what she's been doing.
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:51.400]  That's the way it goes.
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:53.400]  And as far as her health goes,
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:55.400]  I mean, you've read all the stories.
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:56.400]  You've seen all the videos.
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:57.400]  I don't want to add to that.
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:02:59.400]  I just want to double down on one drug,
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:03.400]  also known as Warfarin, which he is on long term.
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:05.400]  That drug is rat poison.
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:07.400]  So Hillary Clinton is on rat poison?
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:08.400]  It is on rat poison.
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:10.400]  Long term, liver damage.
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:14.400]  People are not supposed to fly in planes
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:16.400]  when they're on that drug long term
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:18.400]  because it can lead to more blood clots,
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:21.400]  which is the reason she was put on that drug in the first place.
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:25.400]  So you're talking about even that alone, just that.
[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:28.400]  Don't work at a very high stress job
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:31.400]  if you've had blood clots and you're on Coumadin.
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:32.400]  And that's a fact.
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:33.400]  And now we have her emails
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:35.400]  where she wanted Parkinson's medication.
[02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:37.400]  I mean, it's pretty clear she's degrading quickly.
[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:39.400]  Also, remember the Commerce Department?
[02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:42.400]  The Clintons used that when they were in office to run scams.
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:44.400]  But the State Department's 20 times bigger.
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:46.400]  I think the deal was made at Bilderberg
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:49.400]  when her and Obama met in 2008,
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:52.400]  and she decided to get out of the race,
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:54.400]  was that she'd be co-president.
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:55.400]  And if you really look at it,
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:57.400]  she's been running foreign policy.
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:58.400]  She's been stealing billions.
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:00.400]  She's been co-president, I think.
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:02.400]  I mean, Hillary's been in office a long time.
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:03.400]  Long time.
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:07.400]  And Doug Band, who is a longtime Clinton associate,
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:13.400]  has raised or gotten pledges for $69 billion
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:15.400]  for the Clinton Global Initiative,
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:17.400]  which is another spin-off.
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:19.400]  $69 billion.
[02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:21.400]  What did I do the other day?
[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:23.400]  Let me rip this piece of paper out of here.
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:25.400]  If you add up the spending,
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:29.400]  the government spending of Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, and Missouri,
[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:31.400]  you know, for 2015,
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:35.400]  it does not total $69 billion.
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:38.400]  Where, you know, whose money is that?
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:39.400]  Where does that go?
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:41.400]  That is an incredible black hole.
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:43.400]  We've already had a female president.
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:45.400]  I mean, they admit she ran things more than Bill Clinton.
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:48.400]  So this will be her one, two, three, four, fifth term
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:52.400]  as president if she gets re-elected through fraud.
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:55.400]  John Rappaport, Nomwarefakenews.com, your books are amazing,
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:56.400]  available there on the site.
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:58.400]  We'll talk to you next week.
[02:04:58.400 --> 02:04:59.400]  God bless you.
[02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:00.400]  It's a deal. Thank you, Alex.
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:01.400]  Thank you.
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:03.400]  I know there's a lot of smoke,
[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:05.400]  and there's no fire.
[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:06.400]  This H.P. report...
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:09.400]  Smoke but no fire.
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:12.400]  With all the fireworks on the Fourth of July weekend,
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:14.400]  you may have missed the news that under oath,
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:17.400]  Huma Abedin admitted that Hillary burned
[02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:20.400]  at least some of her schedules as Secretary of State.
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:23.400]  Yeah, schedules in the burn bag.
[02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:26.400]  That may explain why she stonewalled the Associated Press
[02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:29.400]  for three years to stop her schedules from being seen,
[02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:31.400]  to show the pay for play.
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:35.400]  Richard Grinnell, former diplomat said,
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:37.400]  I spent eight years at the State Department
[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:39.400]  and watched as four U.S. ambassadors
[02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:42.400]  and two secretaries of state shared their daily schedules
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:44.400]  with a variety of State Department employees
[02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:45.400]  and U.S. officials.
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:48.400]  I've never seen anyone put their schedule in the burn bag
[02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:51.400]  because every one of them had a state.gov e-mail address.
[02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:54.400]  Therefore, their daily schedules became public records
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:56.400]  as required by law.
[02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:59.400]  I know there's a lot of smoke, and there's no fire.
[02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:22.400]  David Knight, rebelworse.com.

[02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:26.400]  You know, I've talked a lot about the Clintons and their corruption,
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:30.400]  but I was just thinking during the break and doing some research with the crew,
[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:34.400]  and it hit me that it's even worse than I've been saying,
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:38.400]  because I was reminded by the investigative journalist John Rappaport,
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:41.400]  who just left us, if you just tuned in,
[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:45.400]  that the global, the Clinton Global Initiative,
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:48.400]  that is a whole separate charity system,
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:52.400]  the Clintons have raised $69 billion,
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:55.400]  and then they direct where that money goes,
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:09:01.400]  and it's been reported that 97% of her charitable giving goes to her.
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:10.400]  And then upwards of half the money gets spent on jets, hotels, clothing, you name it.
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:13.400]  It's crazy.
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:15.400]  So these people basically don't pay taxes,
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:19.400]  just like Bill and Melinda Gates have put in hundreds of billions of dollars of money
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:22.400]  into the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:24.400]  Warren Buffett's a partner in that,
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:31.400]  and then they get richer and richer and richer because it's tax exempt.
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:35.400]  This is crazy, and it's all about power.
[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:37.400]  It's all about control.
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:40.400]  And then here comes this, you know, upstart to them,
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:44.400]  Donald Trump, who's never played ball in the system,
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:49.400]  the way they want him to, and he's exposing the hat trick.
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:54.400]  He's exposing that there's not really a rabbit materializing inside the hat,
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:57.400]  that when the magician puts the black hat on top of the table,
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:09:59.400]  that there's an open trap door inside,
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:01.400]  and he's pulling the bunny rabbit up through it,
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:03.400]  closing the trap door,
[02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:05.400]  there's a little trap door on the top of the hat,
[02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:08.400]  and then he pulls out the rabbit.
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:11.400]  And children when they're three or four years old will say you're wrong, you're lying,
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:15.400]  unless you can get a magician to turn the table around and show you
[02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:21.400]  that there's a rabbit in a cage inside of it, on the back.
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:23.400]  And that's what these people are doing.
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:25.400]  And look, folks come back at me and they go,
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:28.400]  oh, it's all corrupted, it'll never change, you know, Trump,
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:30.400]  I'm sure he'll be just as bad.
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:33.400]  His history isn't doing stuff like this.
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:40.400]  Donald Trump wouldn't steal the entire place set
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:47.400]  of China, the first China bought by the United States government
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:50.400]  for George Washington's first White House.
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:55.400]  The first executive order is for that China to have the French ambassador
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:59.400]  and the British ambassador later come to dinner.
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:02.400]  That's famous worth millions.
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:04.400]  They stole it.
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:07.400]  They'll steal anything nailed down.
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:10.400]  They don't care, they're hard core criminals,
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:15.400]  and they think you and I are stupid, and they're light years.
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:19.400]  They are eons past Donald Trump.
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:24.400]  There has been a magnifying glass down his throat, up his wazoo,
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:28.400]  all over him and his family, and they can't dig anything up.
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:31.400]  They've put out incredible lies.
[02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:34.400]  Hillary, the problem is there's too much corruption.
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:37.400]  I try to sit there sometimes to shoot a special report
[02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:44.400]  and pull up all her crimes and things she's done, and I get dizzy.
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:47.400]  I've got a good brain, I've got a good memory, and it just starts hitting me.
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:50.400]  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:53.400]  Let's put the Clinton Global Initiative up on screen for TV viewers.
[02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:56.400]  For radio listeners, I'll narrate.
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:04.400]  When they talk about to date, it's raised $60 billion.
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:06.400]  I was in there during the break.
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:09.400]  It's on the back computer. I had it pulled up over there.
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:11.400]  We're going to highlight it and come in and show it on there.
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:12.400]  There it is.
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:17.400]  Douglas J. Bann that heads it up with Tanao Holdings.
[02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:20.400]  He says, Mr. Bann served as President Clinton's chief advisor
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:26.400]  from 2000-2012, advising him as the counselor of the president
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:29.400]  and was the key architect of the Clinton's post-presidency.
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:31.400]  He created and built the Clinton Global Initiative,
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:36.400]  which today has raised $69 billion.
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:39.400]  And then it goes on, organizing not just other people,
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:43.400]  but governments, kids doing food drives, all of it, sucking in.
[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:47.400]  And then it just goes into these black holes in secret bank accounts, all of the world,
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:49.400]  and they won't release any of the info.
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:52.400]  Oh, but Donald Trump won't release his tax returns.
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:54.400]  The only issue with Donald is, he just goes,
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:56.400]  No, I'm not releasing them right now.
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:59.400]  It's private. I don't have to.
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:03.400]  I would say I'll release it when she releases her main bank account records
[02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:08.400]  for her foundation in Canada and in Luxembourg and in Geneva, Switzerland,
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:10.400]  because that's where they're based.
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:16.400]  They have the classic secret bank accounts admittedly and run these things through them.
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:20.400]  I mean, I go in at Christmas and say,
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:22.400]  because people seem to like cash more than checks.
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:24.400]  They seem to realize you're giving them a lot of money.
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:27.400]  And I'll say, I want $20,000.
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:33.400]  I'm going to give people cash bonuses, cash gifts, family, friends, you name it.
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:35.400]  Give somebody a gift card for a hundred bucks or whatever,
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:37.400]  give them a hundred bucks in cash.
[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:40.400]  Like, wow, so I like to promote cash, so I do that.
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:42.400]  And they'll go, excuse us, Mr. Jones,
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:44.400]  and the bank manager will come out even if it's a local bank.
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:46.400]  Look, this is a lot of money.
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:49.400]  And I'm like, really, millions and millions of dollars comes through to run my operation
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:53.400]  and goes out every quarter to pay the bills and stuff.
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:56.400]  I buy millions of dollars worth of product that goes through these banks.
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:58.400]  What do you mean? $20,000 is nothing.
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:01.400]  Well, I'm going to have to fill out a suspicious transaction report.
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:04.400]  Oh, oh, well, go ahead and do it then.
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:08.400]  Big deal. See, oh, I can't get $20,000.
[02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:14.400]  And then I've done events and things, say where we raised $10,000, $15,000,
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:17.400]  signing books and DVDs when I would do some conference.
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:22.400]  You pay for the hotel conference, just that sale.
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:26.400]  But I don't want to be rolling around $15,000 on me, so I go over to the bank
[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:30.400]  and I go in and I say, I want to have this turned into a money order.
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:34.400]  I want to have this turned into a cashier's check or I want to have this wired to my bank.
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:36.400]  And then they count the money up and then the bank manager comes up,
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:38.400]  man, I speak to you, please, sir.
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:41.400]  I'm sitting there in sports jacket, nice guy, no criminal record.
[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:43.400]  They've got my driver's license.
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:46.400]  Where'd this money come from?
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:48.400]  Oh, just Google me. I'm Alex Jones.
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:51.400]  I just had a conference next door at the Sheridan.
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:53.400]  I just want to get this in the bank.
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:55.400]  I need it to pay for the event.
[02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:57.400]  And, you know, it just makes you don't even have the events anymore.
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:14:59.400]  You know what I mean?
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:01.400]  Just because you have to monkey jack with all this stuff.
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:05.400]  But the Clintons, hey, $69 billion, we ain't telling you where it went.
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:08.400]  You know, $10 billion in their foundation.
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:10.400]  They just do whatever they want.
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:14.400]  They steal George Washington's dinner sets.
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:20.400]  They are the filthiest white trash scum the planet's ever seen.
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:26.400]  And she's an ugly degenerate, filthy, murderous piece of filth.
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:30.400]  And they got all these little stinking collaborators because they got their little, you know,
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:36.400]  their little trendy beards and trendy hair and a pink sock and a green sock and little pink shirts.
[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:41.400]  At Media Matters, I've seen them do interviews and they do interviews about the mean Alex Jones.
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:46.400]  We're tattling on him.
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:58.400]  You think working for worldwide murder kingpins is okay because you've got the same hairstyle as the guy in the hangover?
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:02.400]  You work for people as bad as the Nazis.
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:08.400]  I know, though, you think you work for the winners so you don't give a good damn, do you?
[02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:14.400]  And that's why God is going to rub you out.
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:21.400]  But very slowly, I don't hate you.
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:29.400]  But you're like piles of dogmen there. I've got to move out of my way.
[02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:36.400]  And I just think of the traitorousness of you, of people in general that know they're working for a criminal enterprise,
[02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:49.400]  that know they work for George Soros, who admits he wants to overthrow countries and destabilize things to loot them and rob them.
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:52.400]  But you think it's funny and you think it's cute.
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:58.400]  But even mainline newspapers now have the headlines because the eagles gotten so bad the truth is coming out.
[02:16:58.400 --> 02:17:04.400]  George Soros sows chaos globally. He's a megalomaniac.
[02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:07.400]  And then you go read interviews with him and he sits there and goes,
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:17.400]  I had to keep it secret, I would have been locked up in a mental institution, but I knew I was a messiah.
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:23.400]  I guess the devil's messiah.
[02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:32.400]  You're here to save the devil's project with a toddling crone who can't even see five feet in front of her.
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:38.400]  I'm not like people visually impaired. I'm just saying the image of this scrabbling rat-like,
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:44.400]  the opposite of virile demon creature that treats all of her crew like filth doesn't give tips,
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:57.400]  revels in chewing out hotel maids, hates young people, hates good-looking people, just is an abomination.
[02:17:57.400 --> 02:18:01.400]  And then Kid Daniels has this story on infowars.com that no one else has.
[02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:05.400]  And I say that as a bad thing. Usually people love it when we have the exclusive, we have the exclusive.
[02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:07.400]  No, I don't want to have the exclusive.
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:12.400]  I don't want to have to sit and go up against this kingpin and say all these things about her and be on their radar.
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:16.400]  You know what you see on media matters and these other platforms is what the White House and the Clintons want.
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:20.400]  That's in the emails. They direct the talking points.
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:28.400]  So, you know, I have Sauron looking at me, but I'm not afraid of her because I'm afraid of losing my soul because I got one.
[02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:34.400]  I'm afraid of being like you, Hillary. I'm afraid of whatever that cold, horrible places you're in.
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:38.400]  I'm so alive. I feel so good. I'm honorable. I'm strong.
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:42.400]  Thank God I'm not like you people and I don't say that meanly.
[02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:47.400]  But oh my God, it's horrible to even look at you and look at your spirit.
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:53.400]  I can see you and it is very, very sad. Very, very sad.
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:58.400]  I got some chills right there, but not the good ones just thinking about her and what it must be like.
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:00.400]  Oh my God.
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:04.400]  They say psychopaths and people are just the most tortured folks you can imagine.
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:09.400]  They're dreams, you name it. I mean, it's just they are. She's a slave.
[02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:15.400]  She's possessed. She is not her. She is a vessel of wickedness.
[02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:20.400]  Corruption. Did Hillary just manipulate stock prices using Twitter?
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:27.400]  Unusual stock market activity only hours before Hillary causes biotech collapse.
[02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:32.400]  Would Hillary be involved with something like that?
[02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:38.400]  Hillary Clinton's recent tweet attacking biotech firms lowered their stock significantly.
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:44.400]  I'm sure that'll be a big buying time, but not before an insider made a 2,900% profit
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:49.400]  from predicting biotech stocks would collapse.
[02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:55.400]  No, no, no, no. These people with powerful public policy control, they never insider trade.
[02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:59.400]  And as I always say, fish never breath with their gills either.
[02:19:59.400 --> 02:20:02.400]  We'll be back. Stay with us.
[02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:31.400]  Just won't quit.
[02:21:00.400 --> 02:21:04.400]  You know about RVs. You've heard about bunkers.
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:09.400]  But surviving is not recreation and man wasn't made to live underground.
[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:15.400]  Introducing Survivalist Camps, the ultimate fully functional off the grid survival bug outhouse

[02:22:54.400 --> 02:23:08.400]  Today I became a biophoton woman. I put a tablespoon of the Andreas five seed oil in my morning one world way drink
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:14.400]  and was still happy and energized at 3 p.m. Normally I feel tired and spacey at the end of the day.
[02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:19.400]  But today I felt energy and very clear. My friend at the farmers market asked what I was on.
[02:23:19.400 --> 02:23:23.400]  She said my eyes look bright and I had unusual energy for that time of afternoon.
[02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:28.400]  I told her there was a magical oil that enabled my body to absorb the sun's energy as if I were a plant.
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:30.400]  She said I want some.
[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:37.400]  A second one world way shake with the oil when I got home took me to bedtime with that wonderful abundant energy.
[02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:40.400]  I couldn't believe how much I got done and how great I felt.
[02:23:40.400 --> 02:23:46.400]  The combination of one world way and five seed oil produced a significant health event in my life.
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:51.400]  The kind that makes you feel you've been given your life back with a bonus and I'm 64.

[02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:10.400]  Alright, let me get more into the Clinton Foundation. Then other breaking news.
[02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:16.400]  Joe Biggs was out there two days ago at the Trump rally.
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:22.400]  We had one of our other reporters in yesterday, our newest addition, but amazing footage that the crew got
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:29.400]  and that Biggs got of the communists and others, some really over-the-top stuff coming up in the next segment
[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:33.400]  when Joe Biggs co-hosted with me a little bit in the next hour.
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:38.400]  I can't go too far because I have a dentist appointment and I'm going to come back to work after that.
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:43.400]  But if you're a radio listener, you're actually spared a lot of stuff.
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:48.400]  I will say this show is actually better radio-wise because you don't have to look at Hillary Clinton
[02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:58.400]  and look at people like Robbie Mooc. Now, a Mooc in popular nomenclature or vernacular would be the proper word
[02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:03.400]  means a leech and incompetent person that thinks they're smart. It's incredible.
[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:10.400]  I'm not making fun of his last name. I'm sure it's some anglicized, cooler name before, but has been chopped down to Mooc.
[02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:15.400]  Mooc is another one of these Cheshire Cat grin. It's actually a, you know what?
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:21.400]  Eating grin. A Bravo Sierra grin.
[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:25.400]  And he's up there talking about how wonderful the Clinton Foundation is and all this other stuff.
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:30.400]  And even Dana Bash is admitting it's clearly pay-to-play. I mean, it's in the emails,
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:34.400]  okay, I'll give you this million dollars, but I need to get this done. Okay, we'll set the meeting up immediately.
[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:38.400]  And it's a State Department employee working illegally at the Foundation.
[02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:42.400]  Lock her up already, okay? But it doesn't matter.
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:48.400]  We've got another Ivy Liger who thinks he's gone and they all try to walk around and act more arrogant than the next person.
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:54.400]  You couldn't pay me to be around all these wannabe elite slobs. They're scared. They're stupid.
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:26:00.400]  All they've got is their Porsche and their tennis racket and their dumbasses and they're horrible.
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:03.400]  And you can't trust them and you can't do business with them.
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:08.400]  I mean, they're just, I'm not making fun of you if you like a Porsche and play tennis.
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:12.400]  I'm not making fun of you if you have a beard like the guy in the hangover.
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:16.400]  Your beard's cool. It's that they are making it uncool.
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:22.400]  This guy with his little psycho face that everybody thinks is so successful and so manly.
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:27.400]  No, that's not manly. Scumbag.
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:33.400]  Walking around showing us how arrogant you are and how, haha, haha, haha, I'm really arrogant.
[02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:37.400]  I'm really powerful. I'm really confident. Hey, ladies, I know. Oh, hi, ladies.
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:41.400]  You always see them with the same type of woman. You know, another social climber.
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:45.400]  They're never really good looking, but they think they are and they're all real scared and act confident.
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:51.400]  Get out of my planet, people! Oh, what a mook. Let's go to mook.
[02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:58.400]  A new batch of State Department emails were released last week showing Doug Band, a counselor to the Clinton Foundation,
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:05.400]  asking Clinton advisors, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, who were both State Department employees at the time for a quote, favor.
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:11.400]  And he forwarded an email from a Clinton Foundation donor and told them it was important to take care of the request.
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:18.400]  And Huma wrote back and here's what she said. We have all had him on our radar. Personnel has been sending him options.
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:26.400]  Is this the kind of backtracking that has Americans just turned off and done with people who have been in Washington a long time?
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:32.400]  From beauty pageant. Well, first of all, Dana, they tell him to smile all the time. No, I only smile when I feel like it.
[02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:36.400]  You know, I'm supposed to run around smiling all the time. This is what a man looks like this.
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:44.400]  That rest. Let me show you how. Okay? That's a normal behavior. I don't make that face on purpose. That's what a face looks like.
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:53.400]  Every step is following all the appropriate protocols. This was someone who had a relationship with the Clinton Foundation.
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:56.400]  Only time you walk around smiling like that's when you're committing crime.
[02:27:56.400 --> 02:28:05.400]  Robbie, this is not so much where the email is coming from. It's the request in general and who the request is going to, right?
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:09.400]  Well, again, this is someone who had a longstanding relationship with the Clinton Foundation.
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:15.400]  Someone focused like me on shallow dumbass that reads off talking points.
[02:28:15.400 --> 02:28:18.400]  An unreal piece of filth. Diseasing a panic.
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:23.400]  It's a communication, but there was no quid pro quo or anything like that here.
[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:28.400]  And as I said, the email was originated from President Clinton's private office.
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:31.400]  As I said, I crawled out of a possums rear end. Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:37.400]  We have another clip, though. Dealing with the whole Clinton Foundation. Here it is. Go ahead, Blake.
[02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:44.400]  Remember, Anderson, the foundation is a charity. Neither my husband nor I have ever drawn a salary from it.
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:48.400]  You know more about the foundation than you know about anything.
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:53.400]  Let's stop right there. The name of this video is Hillary put up with the Democrats owns Cooper.
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:59.400]  Oh, she owned the admitted CIA officer involved in PSYOP division command.
[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:04.400]  Oh, oh, how did I know? Oh, oh, oh, his, his title's been released.
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:09.400]  Oh, more leaks coming. And you sit there and shovel that at us in that staged event.
[02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:13.400]  Because you can't even do a press conference now. You got to talk over the telephone all day long.
[02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:20.400]  And then you act like you just defeated him in a straw man fight where you beat up an imaginary windmill.
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:25.400]  And then it gets worse than that. From that point on, she's never taken a salary.
[02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:31.400]  No, no, no. It just pays for the jet aircraft and the buildings and all the crew and all your families.
[02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:39.400]  And Chelsea getting six million from it and a 10 million and a half dollar condo and all the helicopters and the caviar and all the other crap.
[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:47.400]  But none of that money will gloss over the fact that you're a big old fat pig with God's shoving an apple in your mouth.
[02:29:47.400 --> 02:29:50.400]  Get ready to put you in the political and spiritual oven.
[02:29:50.400 --> 02:30:01.400]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:01.400 --> 02:30:06.400]  I know there's a lot of smoke and there's no fire. This H.T. report.
[02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:14.400]  Smoke but no fire. With all the fireworks on the Fourth of July weekend, you may have missed the news that under oath,
[02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:20.400]  Huma Abedin admitted that Hillary burned at least some of her schedules as Secretary of State.
[02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:23.400]  Yeah, schedules in the burn bag.
[02:30:23.400 --> 02:30:29.400]  That may explain why she stonewalled the Associated Press for three years to stop her schedule from being seen.
[02:30:29.400 --> 02:30:31.400]  To show the pay for play.
[02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:35.400]  Richard Grinnell, former diplomat said,
[02:30:35.400 --> 02:30:45.400]  I spent eight years at the State Department and watched as four U.S. ambassadors and two Secretaries of State shared their daily schedules with a variety of State Department employees and U.S. officials.
[02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:52.400]  I've never seen anyone put their schedule in the burn bag because every one of them had a state.gov email address.
[02:30:52.400 --> 02:30:57.400]  Therefore, their daily schedules became public records as required by law.
[02:30:57.400 --> 02:30:59.400]  I know there's a lot of smoke and there's no fire.
[02:30:59.400 --> 02:31:01.400]  David Nitro for Worst.com.
[02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:11.400]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce about a group you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:31:11.400 --> 02:31:16.400]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:23.400]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:26.400]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:31:26.400 --> 02:31:28.400]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:31:28.400 --> 02:31:32.400]  There's a PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:35.400]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:37.400]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:31:37.400 --> 02:31:40.400]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:31:40.400 --> 02:31:43.400]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:31:43.400 --> 02:31:44.400]  It's in powder form.
[02:31:44.400 --> 02:31:46.400]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:31:46.400 --> 02:31:47.400]  I take this.

[02:32:01.400 --> 02:32:03.400]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:32:03.400 --> 02:32:04.400]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:32:04.400 --> 02:32:05.400]  Why is this so good?
[02:32:05.400 --> 02:32:11.400]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:16.400]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[02:32:16.400 --> 02:32:28.400]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:31.400]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:32.400]  These are all parasites.
[02:32:32.400 --> 02:32:34.400]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[02:32:34.400 --> 02:32:36.400]  You have the neem in there.
[02:32:36.400 --> 02:32:39.400]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:32:39.400 --> 02:32:42.400]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:32:42.400 --> 02:32:46.400]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:47.400]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:32:47.400 --> 02:32:48.400]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[02:32:48.400 --> 02:32:49.400]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:32:49.400 --> 02:32:52.400]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:55.400]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[02:32:55.400 --> 02:32:57.400]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[02:32:57.400 --> 02:33:14.400]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:33.400]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the infowars.com studios.
[02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:39.400]  I was talking to John Ronson who writes The Guardian, New York Times, you name it.
[02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:40.400]  But I've known him forever.
[02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:43.400]  That's why I did the interview.
[02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:50.400]  He was saying, yeah, no, I really felt the energy in Cleveland like Trump was unstoppable populism.
[02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:53.400]  You know, the Briggs that had just passed, Nigel Farah, his internal odor.
[02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:55.400]  But now I feel like the polls are against Trump.
[02:33:55.400 --> 02:33:56.400]  It's all dissipating.
[02:33:56.400 --> 02:33:58.400]  And I said, that's because you tune into mainstream media.
[02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:00.400]  That's not what's happening in the real world.
[02:34:00.400 --> 02:34:09.400]  They just need to create enough of a hoax so they can steal the election and make it look like Trump lost and keep all these arrested development people like children to go,
[02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:17.400]  hey, ain't any boo boo, you're for Trump the racist, and I'm driving around Austin and I see stores everywhere, you know, selling, I mean, all over the place selling, you know, Trump pinatas.
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:24.400]  But you got 100 people out there protesting against Trump and 20 plus thousand in there, tens of thousands got turned away.
[02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:25.400]  We've got B-roll of all this.
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:27.400]  It's up on infowars.com.
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:28.400]  I mean, it's massive.
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:30.400]  Joe Biggs, you were there.
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:33.400]  How many people got turned away?
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:38.400]  I don't think I've ever seen a traffic jam two and a half miles back where you guys had to get out of the cars and walk in.
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:39.400]  I mean, this was crazy.
[02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:40.400]  Well, I got there.
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:43.400]  Me and Michael Zimmerman were the first ones there that day.
[02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:51.400]  We got there around 1-1-30 in the afternoon, and there was already a line wrapped around the exposition center where they do the road.
[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:53.400]  And he wasn't going to speak until 7.30?
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:54.400]  Yeah, until 7.30.
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:35:01.400]  There was a guy that was waiting in line, told me that they got there at three in the morning, waited outside of the gate, outside of the exposition center,
[02:35:01.400 --> 02:35:07.400]  and then waited in line as they kept opening up the fences throughout that area so they could get closer and closer and be in front of the line.
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:09.400]  I mean, that's crazy.
[02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:10.400]  You don't see that at Hillary Clinton.
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:11.400]  And let's understand it.
[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:15.400]  Two and a half miles away by the time do got there hours before it stopped, they had to get out and walk.
[02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:16.400]  Yeah, they had to walk.
[02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:23.400]  At the end of the road where you come out of the exposition center, there's this long road that goes about one mile to the left and two miles to the right, this straightaway.
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:27.400]  And it was lined with cars on both sides parked tons of...
[02:35:27.400 --> 02:35:28.400]  That's a major highway.
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:29.400]  Yeah.
[02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:31.400]  I mean, it's out in the middle of nowhere, too.
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:37.400]  That's where we do concerts at, the rodeo, a buddy of mine took one of those panoramic photos.
[02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:39.400]  I put it up on Twitter from the inside.
[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:40.400]  Yeah, we know this place.
[02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:41.400]  Well, because we're out there all the time.
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:42.400]  I think my kids see monster trucks.
[02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:43.400]  You name it.
[02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:46.400]  I mean, I've been in that facility 70 times.
[02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:47.400]  Willie Nelson, you name it.
[02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:50.400]  I mean, I went in with the mind, said, all right, we're in liberal Austin.
[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:52.400]  There's not going to be that many people here.
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:54.400]  And when I got there, my mind was just completely blown.
[02:35:54.400 --> 02:36:01.400]  To see that many people in an area that's so liberal, people coming from all over, you know...
[02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:02.400]  But it's not.
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:04.400]  I've been there at the elections in the state.
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:05.400]  Admit it.
[02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:06.400]  We discovered fraud.
[02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:08.400]  It was all over the newspapers and they said, we're still certifying the election.
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:14.400]  It's not Democrat until now it's the invasion port from the failed California op.
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:15.400]  They blow that.
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:17.400]  Now they're going to exploit the next sector.
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:19.400]  You know, there was a video we posted.
[02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:23.400]  I believe it was yesterday where they had this Trump impersonator guy that was on in the video.
[02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:26.400]  And he's walking around and this guy's like talking to him, interviewing him.
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:31.400]  And he said, you know, do you get any backlash from coming out and being Trump and, you know, speaking?
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:32.400]  And he goes, no.
[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:34.400]  He goes, everyone comes up to me.
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:35.400]  They all want a picture.
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:36.400]  They all say they love Trump.
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:39.400]  He said, whatever you see on TV is a complete and total lie.
[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:40.400]  It's BS.
[02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:43.400]  But there are the 100 or so or 200 or sometimes 500 Hillary buses them in,
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:47.400]  which we said from our sources now all confirmed, not Sanders people dressed up,
[02:36:47.400 --> 02:36:50.400]  like Sanders to make his people look bad and make Trump look bad.
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:54.400]  She divide and conquer folks. She's playing both ends, you know, to take them down.
[02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:56.400]  And there were slash tires.
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:36:58.400]  There were some people attacked.
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:00.400]  And as usual, it was the anti-Trump people doing it.
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:02.400]  It was like when I went to the Trump rally in Dallas,
[02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:06.400]  when I was sitting out there in the middle of the protest and the police officer came up to me,
[02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:08.400]  admitted that these guys had been bused in.
[02:37:08.400 --> 02:37:09.400]  We have video.
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:11.400]  They pushed us over or whatever, pushed us out of the way.
[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:12.400]  Like, all right, you guys get out of the way.
[02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:16.400]  We want to get these agitators out of here so they can catch the bus and get back out of here.
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:19.400]  You know, this time it was a smaller amount of people, 70 to 100 people.
[02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:23.400]  But they lived in this little neighborhood that was right across the street.
[02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:26.400]  There was hardly anyone else that came from downtown Austin,
[02:37:26.400 --> 02:37:29.400]  from the liberal trendy area, from the surrounding areas.
[02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:30.400]  It was just the people who lived in...
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:34.400]  Now, in fairness, mainline brainwashed liberals are the laziest people on earth.
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:35.400]  Oh, yeah.
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:37.400]  So, I mean, there are hordes of them that don't like Trump.
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:40.400]  Well, they were downtown dressed up like clowns, acting like clowns.
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:44.400]  15 and 18-year-old women running around with communist outfits on.
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:45.400]  But didn't even know what planet they were on.
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:46.400]  Did you notice?
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:47.400]  They're like, we hate Alex Jones.
[02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:49.400]  Alex Jones, they go, but they didn't even know who I was.
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:50.400]  They were told to say that.
[02:37:50.400 --> 02:37:51.400]  And they hate capitalism.
[02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:53.400]  Meanwhile, they're live-streaming you from their iPhone.
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:55.400]  We're in their brand-new Nikes.
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:57.400]  We ought to ship their butt to...
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:37:59.400]  I'm telling you, North Korea, man.
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:01.400]  You know, I almost had a headline change this morning.
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:04.400]  I rarely do that, but I don't like to be inaccurate.
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:06.400]  And I was watching a John Bowne report.
[02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:07.400]  It was a really good report.
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:10.400]  It's Trump protesters are traders.
[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:13.400]  And I went, you know, this really is a firing global takeover.
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:15.400]  These people really are destroying the sovereignty of the country.
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:17.400]  These people really are American haters.
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:21.400]  They really are, should be deported to the country of their choice.
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:25.400]  Just if you want socialist utopias, go to Venezuela right now,
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:27.400]  where it's war in the streets.
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:28.400]  Or go to another socialist country.
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:29.400]  How about North Korea?
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:32.400]  I mean, seriously, get your ass out, man.
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:34.400]  We should definitely start one of those White House petitions
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:36.400]  to send these people to North Korea.
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:38.400]  All these communists who love it and talk about it.
[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:40.400]  And then when you actually question them,
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:41.400]  they don't even know what the hell it is.
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:43.400]  They go, Mao is who we want.
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:45.400]  Mao, the biggest mass murderer on earth.
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:47.400]  The Hillary Clinton look alike.
[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:50.400]  She does wear weird communist party outfits.
[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:51.400]  Now, I want to get some of these clips.
[02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:54.400]  Before we do that, you've got to start taking this.
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:58.400]  Joe, selenium is one of the biggest trace, you know,
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:00.400]  element minerals out there that people are lacking.
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:04.400]  The amount of energy you get electrochemically from selenium
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:05.400]  is life or death.
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:07.400]  I mean, when you've got enough selenium, it's amazing.
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:08.400]  Read this for yourself.
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:09.400]  If you don't have enough selenium, if you're a male,
[02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:11.400]  it will take it from your brain that has to have it
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:13.400]  and give it to your testicles because your body says that,
[02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:15.400]  you know, that's first, which I kind of agree with, you know.
[02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:17.400]  God designed things correctly.
[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:21.400]  The point is, there's a literal correlation
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:23.400]  when they tell boxers and people, you know,
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:25.400]  don't have sex for a few months for your fight
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:27.400]  because, you know, there's selenium issues.
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:29.400]  But I can go on for hours.
[02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:31.400]  The point is just try it for yourself.
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:32.400]  You can't lose.
[02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:33.400]  It's 1995.
[02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:34.400]  You're supporting the broadcast.
[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:35.400]  It goes with X2.
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:37.400]  The two things work together synergistically.
[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:39.400]  So does vitamin C.
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:41.400]  That's readily available, so we're not selling that.
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:43.400]  Obviously in bioavailable forms like orange peel
[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:44.400]  and things like that.
[02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:47.400]  But you really need to get bio true selenium,
[02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:48.400]  ladies and gentlemen.
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:50.400]  It supports the broadcast.
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:54.400]  It is super organic from the purest place you can get it.
[02:39:54.400 --> 02:39:57.400]  That is Mustard Seed, infowarslife.com
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:39:59.400]  or infowarsstore.com.
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:02.400]  And Amerageddon, the new film, $5 million budget,
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:05.400]  exposing a UN-style takeover and a fictional account
[02:40:05.400 --> 02:40:07.400]  and an EMP attack is also available.
[02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:11.400]  Get a second copy of the film and get some of my films free with it
[02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:13.400]  at infowarsstore.com.
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:16.400]  That's infowarsstore.com is the general store.
[02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:18.400]  Infowarslife.com is on the same store,
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:21.400]  but that URL takes you right to the nutraceuticals
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:23.400]  and look what infowars is doing.
[02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:25.400]  And I'll say this again.
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:26.400]  It's not about bragging.
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:30.400]  It's about you knowing mainstream media is there to make you feel like
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:32.400]  you're all alone on a deserted island.
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:35.400]  Mainstream media is there to make you feel like
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:37.400]  because you believe in the right to self-defense
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:39.400]  or you believe in free market that you're crazy.
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:41.400]  Everyone loves Mao.
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:43.400]  And Mao founded America, not George Washington.
[02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:45.400]  Okay, and Hillary's in the best of health
[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:47.400]  and two plus two equals 50
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:49.400]  and the Easter Bunny's real and Santa Claus loves you
[02:40:49.400 --> 02:40:51.400]  and visited with her last night.
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:54.400]  All of this is just garbage.
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:56.400]  And that's why I say get a Hillary for prison shirt.
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:40:57.400]  Get an info war shirt.
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:40:59.400]  Get a Molan Lambe shirt.
[02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:01.400]  Get a Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:03.400]  And these Trump things are great
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:07.400]  because it's let info warriors experience what I've experienced.
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:11.400]  I'm walking down the street 10 years ago
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:14.400]  and maybe one out of five people said, hey Alex Jones.
[02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:17.400]  It's now, like when I was in London and stuff,
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:19.400]  it was I couldn't even walk down the street.
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:21.400]  And people see this on live stream.
[02:41:21.400 --> 02:41:23.400]  I'm like walking down the street live streaming
[02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:25.400]  and Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones, people all over the world.
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:27.400]  Alex Jones, people from Poland, people from Russia,
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:29.400]  people from Japan, people from London, people from Pakistan.
[02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:31.400]  Alex Jones, it's like, whoa, whoa.
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:33.400]  And again, it's not about, oh, look, I'm famous.
[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:35.400]  I'm not singing songs here.
[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:37.400]  That wouldn't matter if I was famous because of that.
[02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:39.400]  They are resonating and agreeing with our anti-global
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:41.400]  and anti-New World Order message.
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:43.400]  Well, you aren't famous.
[02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:45.400]  But when you wear a Hillary for prison shirt
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:47.400]  or an info war shirt,
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:49.400]  or a drudge ought to sell shirts with drudgerport.com on it,
[02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:51.400]  I guarantee you'd sell 50 million of them.
[02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:53.400]  I'm telling you, drudges do that.
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:55.400]  You may already be doing it.
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:57.400]  It needs to happen. I would promote them.
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:41:59.400]  I mean, I ought to license drudge.
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:01.400]  I need money with them because we need to get these out.
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:03.400]  They need to support the independent media.
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:05.400]  And imagine, nobody's wearing Fox News,
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:07.400]  even though it's better than CNN.
[02:42:07.400 --> 02:42:09.400]  You don't see CNN shirts. You don't see MSNBC shirts.
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:11.400]  Why don't we have drudge report shirts?
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:13.400]  I mean, what I'm saying is
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:15.400]  is that if you saw every 10th person
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:17.400]  wearing a drudge report shirt
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:19.400]  like we're seeing in Austin with info wars
[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:21.400]  and bumper stickers almost on every corner,
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:23.400]  that citizen's doing that.
[02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:25.400]  It flips the system out and they understand
[02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:27.400]  that we are cutting through their signal.
[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:29.400]  We're cutting through their blackout.
[02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:31.400]  We're cutting through their iron curtain.
[02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:33.400]  We're coming in with the real voice of America.
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:35.400]  You want to know what this is?
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:37.400]  This is the real voice of America, folks.
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:39.400]  Coming to you, of course, from Texas, baby,
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:41.400]  with Joe Biggs and the rest of the crew.
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:43.400]  So I'm ramping here, but the point is,
[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:45.400]  you go to a Trump rally. I've seen these videos.
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:47.400]  Sometimes in a crowd, it'd be a third,
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:49.400]  always about 15% were wearing
[02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:51.400]  Hillary for prison shirts or info wars shirts.
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:53.400]  Imagine what that telegraphs the system.
[02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:55.400]  And it's all over the country. It's all over the world.
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:42:57.400]  And that's just little info wars, Joe Biggs.
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:42:59.400]  Zimmerman and I were at the Trump rally on Tuesday.
[02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:01.400]  And I had them bring me out two large boxes
[02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:03.400]  of those Hillary for prison bumper stickers.
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:05.400]  I'm glad you thought of that.
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:07.400]  And we filmed it.
[02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:09.400]  And people swarmed around this.
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:11.400]  We're almost at the point of fighting over it.
[02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:13.400]  And I was just...
[02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:15.400]  Have we put that video out yet?
[02:43:15.400 --> 02:43:17.400]  Yeah. And I was like, Clinton for San Quentin,
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:19.400]  Hillary for prison, you know...
[02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:21.400]  How many Hillary for prison shirts did you see?
[02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:23.400]  I saw a ton on the videos.
[02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:25.400]  I mean, that's everywhere we go now, though.
[02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:27.400]  But I guarantee you...
[02:43:27.400 --> 02:43:29.400]  I went to a Metallica concert and they were like,
[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:31.400]  people were wearing info wars all over the place.
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:33.400]  I went to Dave Mustaine all over the place. Again, it's crazy.
[02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:35.400]  There's going to be 3,000 new cars in Austin, Texas
[02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:37.400]  in the surrounding areas with Hillary
[02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:39.400]  for prison bumper stickers on it.
[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:41.400]  I mean, people were like...
[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:43.400]  Why didn't I think of that?
[02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:45.400]  We should have hit them with 10,000, 50,000.
[02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:47.400]  I got as many as I could, but I mean,
[02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:49.400]  there's going to be a lot more out there.
[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:51.400]  By the way, are those available yet on the site?
[02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:53.400]  I don't know if you can see them, but what they're doing is
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:55.400]  every time someone makes a purchase at the info or store,
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:57.400]  they throw in two or three with their order as well.
[02:43:57.400 --> 02:43:59.400]  This is an added bonus.
[02:43:59.400 --> 02:44:01.400]  Well, that's incredible. Well, good job to those folks.
[02:44:01.400 --> 02:44:03.400]  I want to get to some of these clips.
[02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:05.400]  What's the name of that video so they can pull it up on YouTube?
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:07.400]  The listener too.
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:09.400]  We'd have to look back at it.
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:11.400]  It shows a huge line of people
[02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:13.400]  waiting and it says,
[02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:15.400]  people go crazy for Hillary for prison or something like that
[02:44:15.400 --> 02:44:17.400]  or Austinites go crazy for Hillary for prison
[02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:19.400]  because I do a chant one and then it's the one
[02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:21.400]  right after that where there's a huge line.
[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:23.400]  It's 15 minutes long because we just let the camera roll
[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:25.400]  because I walked all the way from the very beginning
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:27.400]  of the line to the tell in
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:29.400]  and that was around 130 or two.
[02:44:29.400 --> 02:44:31.400]  That's another problem. We have so many great videos
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:33.400]  that a lot of them only get seen like 30, 40,000 people
[02:44:33.400 --> 02:44:35.400]  because we're putting 50 a day out.
[02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:37.400]  I mean, which is still success,
[02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:39.400]  but this should be seen by everybody.
[02:44:39.400 --> 02:44:41.400]  I have been spending hours at night during the day
[02:44:41.400 --> 02:44:43.400]  almost getting nothing done now, just trying to watch
[02:44:43.400 --> 02:44:45.400]  what you guys did because it's all so informative
[02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:47.400]  and so entertaining.
[02:44:47.400 --> 02:44:49.400]  My favorite video, it's not that long,
[02:44:49.400 --> 02:44:51.400]  but it's Black Lives Could Care Less
[02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:53.400]  about Black Lives.
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:55.400]  We're going to get to that in a minute,
[02:44:55.400 --> 02:44:57.400]  but first I want to just point out that you have won
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:44:59.400]  a Thug Life Award
[02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:01.400]  and for folks that don't know what these are,
[02:45:01.400 --> 02:45:03.400]  tell the listeners.
[02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:05.400]  So it's whenever you basically do something
[02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:07.400]  that's pretty awesome
[02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:09.400]  and you essentially
[02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:11.400]  just have to drop the mic and walk away
[02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:13.400]  because you just did something so epic
[02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:15.400]  and then they started making these videos where
[02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:17.400]  it's like sideways hat drops on your forehead
[02:45:17.400 --> 02:45:19.400]  and big glasses with diamonds
[02:45:19.400 --> 02:45:21.400]  and like a joint and a machine gun in your hand
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:23.400]  and they play like some Dr. Dre song
[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:25.400]  in the background.
[02:45:25.400 --> 02:45:27.400]  So it's...
[02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:29.400]  I think it's ludicrous.
[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:31.400]  The point is get out the way.
[02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:33.400]  In fact, okay, here's the short clip
[02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:35.400]  and then we'll play the actual clip first.
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:45.400]  If I go to Mexico right now illegally without citizenship,
[02:45:45.400 --> 02:45:47.400]  and I don't have a passport, I will go to jail.
[02:45:47.400 --> 02:45:49.400]  Okay, okay, and then if you're legal here,
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:51.400]  you should go to jail or be deported.
[02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:53.400]  Okay, I'm waiting for somebody to put me in jail now.
[02:45:53.400 --> 02:45:55.400]  Well, Donald Trump's going to do it.
[02:45:55.400 --> 02:45:57.400]  Stay tuned for more reports to infowars.com.
[02:45:57.400 --> 02:45:59.400]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:05.400]  All right, now let's get serious and get back to the clips. Let's play the one you said you want to play first.
[02:46:05.400 --> 02:46:07.400]  And that is the Black Lives Matter clip.
[02:46:07.400 --> 02:46:09.400]  Black Lives Matter.
[02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:11.400]  Not concerned with helping Black Lives.
[02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:13.400]  Here is Joe Biggs at the Trump rally.
[02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:15.400]  Excuse me, how are you doing?
[02:46:15.400 --> 02:46:17.400]  So why are you guys out here?
[02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:19.400]  Black Lives Matter.
[02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:21.400]  Black Lives Matter.
[02:46:21.400 --> 02:46:25.400]  So if Black Lives Matter, did any of you guys go to Louisiana to help out?
[02:46:25.400 --> 02:46:27.400]  Black Lives Matter.
[02:46:27.400 --> 02:46:29.400]  Black Lives Matter.
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:31.400]  Did you go to Louisiana to help out?
[02:46:31.400 --> 02:46:33.400]  Black Lives Matter.
[02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:35.400]  Hey, you know who did go to Louisiana to help out?
[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:37.400]  You know who did go?
[02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:39.400]  Black Lives Matter.
[02:46:39.400 --> 02:46:41.400]  Exactly, you don't have an argument.
[02:46:41.400 --> 02:46:43.400]  Black Lives Matter.
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:45.400]  When's Black Lives Matter in the train?
[02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:47.400]  You act like a child.
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:49.400]  You didn't want to talk to the president.
[02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:51.400]  Never did no one mess with you. They're all sent by grips.
[02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:53.400]  I said, except in Louisiana.
[02:46:53.400 --> 02:46:55.400]  Except in Louisiana.
[02:46:55.400 --> 02:46:57.400]  You go to Louisiana.
[02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:01.400]  And the police in the background are just kind of like smiling because they're like, yeah.
[02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:03.400]  You're screaming and chanting.
[02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:05.400]  But you're not doing anything to save Black Lives.
[02:47:05.400 --> 02:47:07.400]  They're being murdered in abortion clinics.
[02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:09.400]  They're being killed by Black on Black crimes in Chicago.
[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:11.400]  You're not doing anything.
[02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:13.400]  You're just sitting here and you're chanting.
[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:15.400]  Meanwhile, there are people dying.
[02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:17.400]  So if you actually cared about Black Lives,
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:19.400]  you would get off your butt, do something,
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:21.400]  raise some money in Louisiana,
[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:23.400]  go out there, get a boat, save people.
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:25.400]  Guess who went there? Donald Trump.
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:29.400]  And it's now over 1,500 people shot in Chicago this year.
[02:47:29.400 --> 02:47:31.400]  Over 90% of them were Blacks.
[02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:33.400]  That's over 1,000 Black people shot.
[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:35.400]  Over 500, almost 600 dead.
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:37.400]  And you'll literally tell Black Lives Matter about that.
[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:39.400]  They just don't even look at you. They don't even hear you.
[02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:41.400]  They don't even care.
[02:47:41.400 --> 02:47:43.400]  It's drugs being shipped into the neighborhoods.
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:45.400]  It's globalism. It's the deindustrialization.
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:47.400]  It's the MTV culture.
[02:47:47.400 --> 02:47:49.400]  It's why those neighborhoods are like that.
[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:51.400]  Not because of the cops.
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:53.400]  It's just out of hand.
[02:47:53.400 --> 02:47:55.400]  It's just a total scapegoat
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:57.400]  to destabilize these inner-city areas.
[02:47:57.400 --> 02:47:59.400]  The Democrats are the main people doing it.
[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:01.400]  Then they have the police that are the lowest level of the government,
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:03.400]  throw them at it,
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:05.400]  and then blame them like a rearguard action
[02:48:05.400 --> 02:48:07.400]  that it's their fault.
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:09.400]  But why do you go and protest Donald Trump?
[02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:11.400]  He's the only one that went there.
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:13.400]  It took days for Obama to go out there because he was...
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:15.400]  I don't need to be intellectual.
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:17.400]  You are a racist.
[02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:19.400]  Have you seen the meme?
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:21.400]  You're a white male.
[02:48:21.400 --> 02:48:23.400]  You're a white male.
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:25.400]  You're a white male.
[02:48:25.400 --> 02:48:27.400]  You're a white male.
[02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:29.400]  Obama is standing on top of the car.
[02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:31.400]  It looks like he's taking a chip shop and it says,
[02:48:31.400 --> 02:48:33.400]  can I play through?
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:35.400]  Meanwhile, he's standing on top of a car that's submerged under water in Louisiana.
[02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:37.400]  It says, can I play through?
[02:48:37.400 --> 02:48:39.400]  That's okay because he's black.
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:41.400]  It's ridiculous.
[02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:43.400]  But they're standing outside of this event
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:45.400]  protesting the only person who went there.
[02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:47.400]  What you say doesn't matter.
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:49.400]  You're a white male.
[02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:51.400]  We have people all over the country march up and say,
[02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:53.400]  safe space, white women, you name it.
[02:48:53.400 --> 02:48:55.400]  And they say, you are white.
[02:48:55.400 --> 02:48:57.400]  You're not allowed to speak.
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:48:59.400]  University of Chicago today came out and said
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:01.400]  they will no longer coddle students at their university
[02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:03.400]  that there will not be safe spaces anymore.
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:05.400]  This mental illness is being exposed.
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:07.400]  Here it is. The college.
[02:49:07.400 --> 02:49:09.400]  This is the University of Chicago.
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:11.400]  Very prestigious.
[02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:13.400]  And very liberal.
[02:49:13.400 --> 02:49:15.400]  Our commitment to academic freedom means
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:17.400]  we do not cancel invited speakers
[02:49:17.400 --> 02:49:19.400]  because their topics might prove controversial.
[02:49:19.400 --> 02:49:21.400]  We do not condone the creation
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:23.400]  of intellectual safe spaces
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:25.400]  where individuals can retreat from ideas
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:27.400]  and perspectives and odds with their own.
[02:49:27.400 --> 02:49:29.400]  Again, welcome to the University of Chicago.
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:31.400]  See you in September.
[02:49:31.400 --> 02:49:33.400]  Sincerely, J. Ellison, Ph.D.,
[02:49:33.400 --> 02:49:35.400]  Dean of Students in the college.
[02:49:35.400 --> 02:49:37.400]  I think they're getting a lot more students
[02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:39.400]  who are going to sign up and want to go there.
[02:49:39.400 --> 02:49:41.400]  Probably call for them to resign.
[02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:43.400]  A lot of these universities
[02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:45.400]  they ban everything
[02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:47.400]  like up in Missouri.
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:49.400]  Apologize for everything.
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:51.400]  And then the presidents, people resign
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:53.400]  and the protest continues.
[02:49:53.400 --> 02:49:55.400]  And of course, then they saw like a 30% drop
[02:49:55.400 --> 02:49:57.400]  in attendance. It's crazy, man.
[02:49:57.400 --> 02:49:59.400]  Who would pay $100,000
[02:49:59.400 --> 02:50:01.400]  to send their young adult
[02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:03.400]  to one of these things?
[02:50:03.400 --> 02:50:05.400]  I need my safe space.
[02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:09.400]  We're going to break here in a moment,
[02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:11.400]  but I just want to tell you that
[02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:13.400]  things are getting crazier and crazier.
[02:50:13.400 --> 02:50:15.400]  What does your gut tell you about Trump?
[02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:17.400]  If he gets crowds of 20,000 people everywhere
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:19.400]  and Hillary can't even get 100,
[02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:21.400]  we should be showing some of that when we come back.
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:23.400]  Her crowds are 200s of big crowd for her now.
[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:25.400]  And now she's suddenly nowhere to be seen.
[02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:27.400]  She's supposed to give this speech about
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:29.400]  banning right-wing media,
[02:50:29.400 --> 02:50:31.400]  but she's canceled it or...
[02:50:31.400 --> 02:50:33.400]  It keeps getting delayed.
[02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:35.400]  I guess they're looking for stools and pillows
[02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:37.400]  or proper up maybe a couple more shots from her handler.
[02:50:37.400 --> 02:50:39.400]  You know...
[02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:41.400]  I'm walking behind her.
[02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:43.400]  I feel like in a mental institution,
[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:45.400]  when they take the real psycho out,
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:47.400]  they got a needle right there with them.
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:49.400]  They walk it behind your back.
[02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:51.400]  Careful!
[02:50:51.400 --> 02:50:53.400]  Like a piranha dog or something.
[02:50:53.400 --> 02:50:55.400]  He's a...
[02:50:55.400 --> 02:50:57.400]  Oh, my gosh, he's going to have nuclear weapons.
[02:50:57.400 --> 02:50:59.400]  Oh, man. Do they tell us Trump is scary?
[02:50:59.400 --> 02:51:01.400]  Yeah, we're going to get him fake security.
[02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:03.400]  This woman is obviously completely out of her mind.
[02:51:03.400 --> 02:51:09.400]  Aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead,
[02:51:09.400 --> 02:51:11.400]  disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines,
[02:51:11.400 --> 02:51:13.400]  and pharmaceuticals like statins,
[02:51:13.400 --> 02:51:15.400]  pain meds and antidepressants.
[02:51:15.400 --> 02:51:17.400]  They know water treatment plants are not equipped
[02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:19.400]  to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[02:51:19.400 --> 02:51:21.400]  Protect your family's water supply
[02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:23.400]  with a trusted big Berkey water filter.
[02:51:23.400 --> 02:51:25.400]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests
[02:51:25.400 --> 02:51:27.400]  show big Berkey water filters remove
[02:51:27.400 --> 02:51:29.400]  chloramines, pharmaceuticals,
[02:51:29.400 --> 02:51:31.400]  BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses.
[02:51:31.400 --> 02:51:33.400]  All forms of fluoride and much more.
[02:51:33.400 --> 02:51:35.400]  Big Berkey water filters are the original

[02:51:45.400 --> 02:51:47.400]  to purify stagnant pond water.

[02:54:13.400 --> 02:54:14.400]  By the end of the third hour,
[02:54:14.400 --> 02:54:16.400]  my brain is just scrambled joke.
[02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:18.400]  I studied the criminality of these people.
[02:54:18.400 --> 02:54:20.400]  I know so much about them
[02:54:20.400 --> 02:54:22.400]  just like you do and it's just a joke.
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:24.400]  I was asking you during the break
[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:26.400]  do you think Trump's going to win?
[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:28.400]  Repeat what you said.
[02:54:28.400 --> 02:54:30.400]  Why? It's going to definitely be a landslide.
[02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:32.400]  I've been all over the country
[02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:34.400]  to all these events and when you see
[02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:36.400]  the amount of people that show up,
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:38.400]  the amount of people that come from other states
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:40.400]  and the surrounding states, other countries
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:42.400]  it's amazing.
[02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:44.400]  Notice this is America. These are hard
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:46.400]  working people that are motivated
[02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:48.400]  and will wait for hours and will drive to be a place.
[02:54:48.400 --> 02:54:50.400]  It sure proves they're the folks that
[02:54:50.400 --> 02:54:52.400]  actually do the work in this country.
[02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:54.400]  Because where are the jackass liberals?
[02:54:54.400 --> 02:54:56.400]  They can't even show up to protest.
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:54:58.400]  Hillary has to bust them in and then they're so immoral
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:00.400]  they'll actually wear the burning shirts
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:02.400]  they're ordered to have and then repeat
[02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:04.400]  the slogans they're given.
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:06.400]  What despicable, horrible slaves.
[02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:08.400]  There's also been a progression though
[02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:10.400]  as far as Trump supporters too.
[02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:12.400]  At the beginning, back when a lot of these violent riots
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:14.400]  protests were happening, a lot of people were scared
[02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:16.400]  to wear Trump shirts out in public and hats.
[02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:18.400]  And now when I go out all across the country
[02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:20.400]  I'm seeing people in gas stations
[02:55:20.400 --> 02:55:22.400]  at restaurants proudly wearing Trump shirts
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:24.400]  they're not in an event. They just wanted to be out
[02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:26.400]  and wear it. And for a while people were kind
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:28.400]  of scared to do that and you're not seeing that anymore
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:30.400]  because we're winning.
[02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:32.400]  We've defeated them already because people
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:34.400]  are seeing what we're showing here.
[02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:36.400]  The massive amounts of people coming in.
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:38.400]  Absolutely. Just give people a radar, sonar ping.
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:40.400]  You've been here a couple years.
[02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:42.400]  Almost three years now.
[02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:44.400]  How much do you notice now when you're on the street?
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:46.400]  A good bit.
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:48.400]  On average, let's say you go downtown
[02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:50.400]  in Austin, maybe
[02:55:50.400 --> 02:55:52.400]  four to five people
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:54.400]  if I go on Reigning Street or something
[02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:56.400]  but a lot of people will recognize my voice
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:55:58.400]  and then they'll go, oh, Joe Biggs
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:00.400]  because a lot of people don't watch.
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:02.400]  It's constantly, in fact,
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:04.400]  exactly, I saw the cops
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:06.400]  coming up to the hiking bike trail the other day.
[02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:08.400]  They ordered to give tickets to people down there because they closed it.
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:10.400]  There's the flooding. And Pat Riley
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:12.400]  was with me and my son was with me when we were hiking
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:14.400]  and I was shooting a video and Pat looked
[02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:16.400]  and the cops heard my voice and went
[02:56:16.400 --> 02:56:18.400]  and turns around and goes, we're not giving tickets.
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:20.400]  Stop. It's Alex Jones. Turn around.
[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:22.400]  Let me start to get that on video.
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:24.400]  But my point is, is that
[02:56:24.400 --> 02:56:26.400]  we get more people coming up to us
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:28.400]  than when I see mainstream media folks
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:30.400]  like Charlie Rose walking around
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:32.400]  in Cleveland. No one was coming up to him
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:34.400]  so I ran over to him. He's walking around
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:36.400]  with thousands of people around him. No one wants to talk to Charlie Rose.
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:38.400]  He has a morning CBS show
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:40.400]  supposedly with five million viewers.
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:42.400]  No one even cares about it.
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:44.400]  I saw him one of the days and I just kind of went,
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:46.400]  look, it's Charlie Rose. And then I just kept walking.
[02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:48.400]  You know, because there's really no connection
[02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:50.400]  there for me because he's not
[02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:52.400]  really promoting anything that I want to be a part of.
[02:56:52.400 --> 02:56:54.400]  It's just that I've seen him before.
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:56.400]  I've seen some of his shows and I was kind of like, oh, look, he's there.
[02:56:56.400 --> 02:56:58.400]  Exactly. People are almost emotionalist
[02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:00.400]  about the establishment media.
[02:57:00.400 --> 02:57:02.400]  But when we go out to these events, like at the Trump rally,
[02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:04.400]  tons of people are coming up to us there.
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:06.400]  And we had a lot of fans of the Democrat deal.
[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:08.400]  Oh, tons. I mean, it was ridiculous.
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:10.400]  The police in Philadelphia, I was walking by
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:12.400]  and this guy goes, yo, bigs.
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:15.400]  I looked over and it was two black cops on bikes.
[02:57:15.400 --> 02:57:17.400]  And they were standing in front of the wall
[02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:19.400]  that was there to keep people out.
[02:57:19.400 --> 02:57:21.400]  And they're like, yo, man, tell Alex we said, hey, man,
[02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:23.400]  we love this show, man, we watch you guys all the time.
[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:25.400]  Well, I mean, I don't want to get in trouble, but we were cheered
[02:57:25.400 --> 02:57:27.400]  by the Secret Service like everywhere we went.
[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:29.400]  I had this really big tall guy come running at me
[02:57:29.400 --> 02:57:31.400]  in a bulletproof vest and he's got a gun in Philadelphia.
[02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:33.400]  And I was like, what the hell did I do?
[02:57:33.400 --> 02:57:35.400]  And this guy goes, can I get a picture?
[02:57:35.400 --> 02:57:37.400]  I love you guys. I'm like, hold on.
[02:57:37.400 --> 02:57:39.400]  It was Homeland Security. I was like, yeah, sure.
[02:57:39.400 --> 02:57:41.400]  He's like six foot eight and I'm like five, nine.
[02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:43.400]  And I'm sitting here like, all right, man, this is next time.
[02:57:43.400 --> 02:57:46.400]  Don't run at me so quick, man. I didn't know what was going on.
[02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:48.400]  Trying to have a little PTSD there.
[02:57:48.400 --> 02:57:50.400]  I was like, what the hell, man? But it's everywhere.
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:53.400]  Like the Cleveland Police Department just loved us.
[02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:56.400]  I mean, just responsive. I mean,
[02:57:56.400 --> 02:57:58.400]  No, no, don't tell people. Don't tell them.
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:01.400]  Anyways, it's pretty ridiculous. It's pretty ridiculous.
[02:58:01.400 --> 02:58:04.400]  And again, that's got to worry Hillary.
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:07.400]  Oh, definitely. I mean, I've been to her rallies as well.
[02:58:07.400 --> 02:58:09.400]  And it's very lackluster.
[02:58:09.400 --> 02:58:13.400]  Most of the people that go to her rallies are going to hear her lie in person
[02:58:13.400 --> 02:58:16.400]  because they just want to see that in person from what's in their life.
[02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:19.400]  And I want to be clear about something we're going to hold over in the next hour.
[02:58:19.400 --> 02:58:22.400]  I think if Shardison be joining us from the other studio, from the radio studio,
[02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:24.400]  we're here in the TV studio.
[02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:28.400]  But of course, they're bad cops. Of course, they're bad people in every group.
[02:58:28.400 --> 02:58:31.400]  We want to reform some of the problems that the globalist brought into the police.
[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:34.400]  But here's the deal. America's getting taken down by outside globalists.
[02:58:34.400 --> 02:58:37.400]  The proof's coming out in emails and Americans are all rallying together.
[02:58:37.400 --> 02:58:40.400]  Whether you're a cop, a citizen, black, white, it doesn't matter, Hispanic,
[02:58:40.400 --> 02:58:43.400]  together to try to save this country.
[02:58:43.400 --> 02:58:46.400]  Epic history's happening, and America's not flat-footed.
[02:58:46.400 --> 02:58:50.400]  We are awake. We're growing, and we're ready.
[02:58:51.400 --> 02:58:53.400]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say,
[02:58:53.400 --> 02:58:57.400]  Secret 12 after two SuperMail brain-borsed prostagart silver bullet.
[02:58:57.400 --> 02:59:00.400]  I use them all. They're phenomenal. They work.
[02:59:00.400 --> 02:59:01.400]  Bye, folks.
[02:59:01.400 --> 02:59:02.400]  Thank you, brother.
[02:59:02.400 --> 02:59:04.400]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:07.400]  I am a relatively short-time listener,
[02:59:07.400 --> 02:59:10.400]  and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[02:59:10.400 --> 02:59:12.400]  Welcome to the InfoWare.
[02:59:12.400 --> 02:59:16.400]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health
[02:59:16.400 --> 02:59:18.400]  and the InfoWare at the same time.
[02:59:18.400 --> 02:59:20.400]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals,
[02:59:20.400 --> 02:59:22.400]  CasioFX, uh, Nacinotide.
[02:59:22.400 --> 02:59:24.400]  Why, God, let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[02:59:24.400 --> 02:59:27.400]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[02:59:27.400 --> 02:59:29.400]  What products are you taking? Are you taking?
[02:59:29.400 --> 02:59:34.400]  I'm taking from, uh, SuperMail to, uh, BrainForce to Winterson, uh, X2.
[02:59:34.400 --> 02:59:38.400]  Even got a little, uh, DNA force, so when I just re-upped everything,
[02:59:38.400 --> 02:59:40.400]  and I just went to Autofill.
[02:59:40.400 --> 02:59:43.400]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research
[02:59:43.400 --> 02:59:45.400]  and to see the reviews for yourself.
[02:59:45.400 --> 03:00:00.400]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:00:15.400 --> 03:00:18.400]  It's a dangerous place, not because of evil,
[03:00:18.400 --> 03:00:22.400]  but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:00:22.400 --> 03:00:27.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:27.400 --> 03:00:31.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:00:31.400 --> 03:00:33.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:33.400 --> 03:00:36.400]  Twenty-five years ago when I first got politically involved,
[03:00:36.400 --> 03:00:38.400]  I would go speak at city council because it was on cable.
[03:00:38.400 --> 03:00:39.400]  People would see it.
[03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:42.400]  I would go speak at the county commissioners,
[03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:45.400]  and I would bring up the new world order, world government.
[03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:48.400]  I would read quotes by David Rockefeller about destroying our sovereignty,
[03:00:48.400 --> 03:00:52.400]  Senator Goldwater fighting back, and they'd laugh at me and make jokes.
[03:00:52.400 --> 03:00:55.400]  See, people aren't laughing now, and that's my point.
[03:00:55.400 --> 03:01:00.400]  As bad as stuff is, the police are awake
[03:01:00.400 --> 03:01:03.400]  because the globalists went too far with their Soros plan
[03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:05.400]  and started saying go kill cops and stuff,
[03:01:05.400 --> 03:01:08.400]  and the police know about how they do this in third world countries.
[03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:10.400]  So they're like, oh my God, the worst is true.
[03:01:10.400 --> 03:01:14.400]  The military is basically almost completely awake unless somebody's really stupid.
[03:01:14.400 --> 03:01:16.400]  And they're in trouble, Joe Bix.
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:17.400]  Yes, they are.
[03:01:17.400 --> 03:01:20.400]  And with the military, that point being made, that's very true.
[03:01:20.400 --> 03:01:23.400]  You know, there's a lot of soldiers that I was in with that are still in
[03:01:23.400 --> 03:01:27.400]  who watched the show religiously, who watched it before I even knew the show existed
[03:01:27.400 --> 03:01:31.400]  back when I was in Iraq in like 2014 and stuff that were watching the show
[03:01:31.400 --> 03:01:34.400]  and listening to your videos and watching your documentaries.
[03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:36.400]  And I didn't even know the show existed.
[03:01:36.400 --> 03:01:38.400]  Most of them thought I was such a gung-ho soldier.
[03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:39.400]  When was this?
[03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:44.400]  I was scared to tell me like back in 2013, all the way through 2013 when I got out.
[03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:48.400]  You know, I never knew the show existed until after I got out with the whole Hastings thing.
[03:01:48.400 --> 03:01:51.400]  But most of the soldiers wouldn't even come to me and tell me about it
[03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:56.400]  because they thought I was such a gung-ho US Army by the book, you know, Rambo type guy.
[03:01:56.400 --> 03:02:00.400]  And when I got out and started working here, everybody just started emailing me and calling me
[03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:03.400]  like, you worked for Alex Jones, that's the most amazing show ever.
[03:02:03.400 --> 03:02:06.400]  I was about to add, I was about to add though, that's compartmentalization.
[03:02:06.400 --> 03:02:10.400]  Everyone feels like they're alone. We're all compartmentalizing right now.
[03:02:10.400 --> 03:02:12.400]  And realizing, hey, we're the majority.
[03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:14.400]  And we're not black, we're not white, we're patriots.
[03:02:14.400 --> 03:02:20.400]  I mean, I did a report earlier this week on Monday where the US Army had a OPSEC brief
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:24.400]  and in the slide it listed Hillary Clinton as a security threat
[03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:28.400]  with her mishandling of classified materials along with General Petraeus and all that.
[03:02:28.400 --> 03:02:30.400]  And notice they said no comment, which means it's real.
[03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:33.400]  Well, the story that I came out with was Monday.
[03:02:33.400 --> 03:02:37.400]  Later Monday night, the Army pulled the slide from their briefs
[03:02:37.400 --> 03:02:39.400]  that had been going on for almost over a year.
[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:41.400]  Then Tuesday, NBC covered it.
[03:02:41.400 --> 03:02:45.400]  Then Wednesday, the Army came out yesterday in Army Times
[03:02:45.400 --> 03:02:47.400]  and said that they pulled Hillary Clinton's slide.
[03:02:47.400 --> 03:02:50.400]  Oh, see, I didn't know that, but I said no, that's real.
[03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:52.400]  Because when they say no comment, that means real.
[03:02:52.400 --> 03:02:55.400]  Oh, yeah, it was real. It was a real slide that was in circulation for about 18 months
[03:02:55.400 --> 03:02:58.400]  and the Army pulled it down after the backlash from the videos.
[03:02:58.400 --> 03:03:03.400]  Well, that's because the Army is openly ignoring Obama and Hillary at this point because they're not our leaders.
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:06.400]  They are foreign imposters, General Flynn, all of them know folks.
[03:03:06.400 --> 03:03:10.400]  I mean, this is a big deal. It's a soft coup as Pachennik.
[03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:12.400]  And Pachennik's been running around to the generals and stuff.
[03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:14.400]  They've been meeting and things.
[03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:17.400]  That's the thing, people, the listeners and stuff, I don't tell people a bunch of stuff
[03:03:17.400 --> 03:03:22.400]  because it's so historic, so over the top that I can't even believe I'm in the middle of it.
[03:03:22.400 --> 03:03:25.400]  But just believe me, the only reason I'm alive is the good Lord above,
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:31.400]  but also there's so many good people and agencies that I'm under full surveillance for my own safety.
[03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:35.400]  I mean, I've been told in the threat fusion centers and stuff, everything I do is watched.
[03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:37.400]  And that's to protect me.
[03:03:37.400 --> 03:03:39.400]  Is that not crazy?
[03:03:39.400 --> 03:03:41.400]  I believe that 100%.
[03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:45.400]  When I go and I go to do some of these reports and these police come up to us and the FBI contacts me
[03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:49.400]  and says, hey, we're watching you in Mexico when you're going down there looking at this.
[03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:50.400]  What did you find out?
[03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:52.400]  You know, they're watching.
[03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:56.400]  Yeah, and so I realized the Psyop, they come in, corrupt our government, take it over,
[03:03:56.400 --> 03:04:00.400]  have the government do bad stuff and then have us have a war with our government so they come in after.
[03:04:00.400 --> 03:04:02.400]  No, we're not doing that.
[03:04:02.400 --> 03:04:03.400]  We've caught you.
[03:04:03.400 --> 03:04:04.400]  We know your plan.
[03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:06.400]  You are screwed, Soros.
[03:04:06.400 --> 03:04:07.400]  You are screwed.
[03:04:07.400 --> 03:04:12.400]  And I played along with fighting with the cops and stuff before I paradigm shifted in the last decade
[03:04:12.400 --> 03:04:14.400]  and it's just part of getting older and more sophisticated.
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:16.400]  And we're all learning more faster and faster now, too.
[03:04:16.400 --> 03:04:17.400]  Yeah, it's not flip-flopping.
[03:04:17.400 --> 03:04:20.400]  As you get older, you start to understand the world better.
[03:04:20.400 --> 03:04:22.400]  You start to see behind the curtain.
[03:04:22.400 --> 03:04:26.400]  You start to understand everything clearer.
[03:04:26.400 --> 03:04:32.400]  And that's what the show does is it kind of imagine being born with a pair of glasses on, but they're really foggy.
[03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:37.400]  And as time progresses, you start cleaning them off and you start to be able to see clear and clear.
[03:04:37.400 --> 03:04:41.400]  And eventually you get to a point where it's all clear and you can see it and it's scary.
[03:04:41.400 --> 03:04:44.400]  It's like you're driving through the mountains and you go through the cloud cover.
[03:04:44.400 --> 03:04:46.400]  All of a sudden you're up above the clouds.
[03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:48.400]  You see the blue sky and the mountains of the moon rising.
[03:04:48.400 --> 03:04:49.400]  You're like, this is incredible.
[03:04:49.400 --> 03:04:50.400]  And that's what it's like.
[03:04:50.400 --> 03:04:52.400]  It's just more and more.
[03:04:52.400 --> 03:04:56.400]  We're just like, whoa, we can see for miles and miles and miles, hundreds of miles.
[03:04:56.400 --> 03:04:59.400]  And we're all seeing this together.
[03:04:59.400 --> 03:05:01.400]  We're all sharing the same truth.
[03:05:01.400 --> 03:05:07.400]  Once again, the top leading news site in the world, The Drudge Report, is putting Hillary Clinton's health to test
[03:05:07.400 --> 03:05:12.400]  with a scathing new slew of articles detailing funny business as well as bad health indicators.
[03:05:12.400 --> 03:05:19.400]  Hypothyroidism is the latest Hillary health issue, as well as revelations that she was unfit to fly commercial in 2009,
[03:05:19.400 --> 03:05:22.400]  so she felt the need to request Air Force One.
[03:05:22.400 --> 03:05:26.400]  WikiLeaks recently leaked emails tying Hillary Clinton to Decision Fatigue Disorder.
[03:05:26.400 --> 03:05:31.400]  Last week and yesterday, Infowars.com discussed Clinton's potential ties to Parkinson's,
[03:05:31.400 --> 03:05:38.400]  given her use of a drug, Provigil, as well as Comedine, a very serious and dangerous blood thinner.
[03:05:38.400 --> 03:05:43.400]  Not only health issues, but underhanded shenanigans were also exposed in recent emails leaked from WikiLeaks,
[03:05:43.400 --> 03:05:47.400]  showing that Chelsea Clinton was using a fake name when emailing her mother, Hillary.
[03:05:47.400 --> 03:05:53.400]  More deleted emails with Huma Abedim have leaked, who was in charge of covering for the Clinton Foundation money laundering scam.
[03:05:53.400 --> 03:05:58.400]  Be sure to share these news stories with friends and family before the Clinton Foundation deletes them.
[03:05:58.400 --> 03:06:09.400]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[03:06:28.400 --> 03:06:31.400]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it.
[03:06:31.400 --> 03:06:35.400]  Read about it. Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise,
[03:06:35.400 --> 03:06:41.400]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:06:41.400 --> 03:06:45.400]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:06:45.400 --> 03:06:51.400]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[03:06:51.400 --> 03:07:01.400]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfowarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:07:01.400 --> 03:07:08.400]  More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[03:07:08.400 --> 03:07:13.400]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ
[03:07:13.400 --> 03:07:18.400]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride,
[03:07:18.400 --> 03:07:24.400]  the bad member of the halogen family, into the water. They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[03:07:24.400 --> 03:07:28.400]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[03:07:28.400 --> 03:07:31.400]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[03:07:31.400 --> 03:07:38.400]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[03:07:38.400 --> 03:07:44.400]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:07:44.400 --> 03:07:46.400]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:07:46.400 --> 03:07:52.400]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[03:07:52.400 --> 03:08:20.400]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfowarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:08:20.400 --> 03:08:33.400]  Well, Salon normally is promoting pedophilia and how great it is to lust after four-year-old girls.
[03:08:33.400 --> 03:08:39.400]  I'm not kidding. This is like something that is a running theme with these people. It's a war on decency.
[03:08:39.400 --> 03:08:48.400]  We have to bring them to heel, watch a decade of Hillary Clinton's shameful hypocrisy on racism, and they make a joke out of it.
[03:08:48.400 --> 03:08:56.400]  It's like when I talked about Uma Abedin, how she had sexual mutilation because her parents are serious Muslim scholar clerics,
[03:08:56.400 --> 03:09:03.400]  and her mother promotes Sharia law, which means you cut a woman's genitals off, and they had, I'm not exaggerating,
[03:09:03.400 --> 03:09:11.400]  at least 10 national news stories and newspapers, you name it, attacking me and Roger Stone for saying, who knows, does she have her genitals?
[03:09:11.400 --> 03:09:18.400]  And they said, oh, we're obsessed with women and don't know about women and are digging through our sister's underwear drawer.
[03:09:18.400 --> 03:09:24.400]  And these articles, all kind of, because I read like 4 or 5 this morning, were like fetishy, like they kind of liked it.
[03:09:24.400 --> 03:09:28.400]  It was like they were playing to their pervert readers. We're like serious, man.
[03:09:28.400 --> 03:09:33.400]  This woman runs around these flower outfits and stays in the same hotel room with Hillary and all this.
[03:09:33.400 --> 03:09:35.400]  We're not saying it's bad that they're lesbians, whatever.
[03:09:35.400 --> 03:09:41.400]  The point is, is that then they support Sharia law that would kill a lesbian. That's what we're talking about.
[03:09:41.400 --> 03:09:45.400]  Media, Blue State, all you different newspapers and publications.
[03:09:45.400 --> 03:09:47.400]  Not that, oh, we're obsessed.
[03:09:47.400 --> 03:09:50.400]  Well, we are obsessed, but the point is not obsessed like we don't know anything about it.
[03:09:50.400 --> 03:09:52.400]  Like we're trying to discover something.
[03:09:52.400 --> 03:09:55.400]  Let me give me a break. These people are crazy pigs.
[03:09:55.400 --> 03:09:59.400]  It's Stockholm syndrome. They loved.
[03:09:59.400 --> 03:10:05.400]  Yeah, it's pretty easy. Let's support Sharia law in the Islamic terrorist. Please cut my head off.
[03:10:05.400 --> 03:10:10.400]  And they just guide the guy's hand holding the blade up to their neck and they just love it and they're smiling and giggling.
[03:10:10.400 --> 03:10:16.400]  And they have writers that shit they're drooling and then showing videos of 4 year old girls.
[03:10:16.400 --> 03:10:25.400]  I mean, that was sick. I saw that this guy comes out with this video and says he's a pedophile and he doesn't want to be looked at like he's inhumane or he's some bad person.
[03:10:25.400 --> 03:10:30.400]  Like I've never really done anything with a child, but I do have sexual fantasies with young girls.
[03:10:30.400 --> 03:10:33.400]  No, that's completely and totally messed up. We should not be promoting that.
[03:10:33.400 --> 03:10:38.400]  Meanwhile, the same liberal media says arrest a guy of his 18 and his girlfriend's 17.
[03:10:38.400 --> 03:10:41.400]  No, they should amend the statutory rape laws.
[03:10:41.400 --> 03:10:47.400]  But when it's a guy going after your 5 year old daughter, execute them.
[03:10:47.400 --> 03:10:55.400]  I mean, you know, it is just the craziest stuff. I mean, let me tell you, when I was 16, I had girlfriends that were 25.
[03:10:55.400 --> 03:11:03.400]  And that was not statutory rape. I will assure you, I'm not trying to get graphic. It's just true. I'm not bragging. It is true.
[03:11:03.400 --> 03:11:08.400]  I tell you, what a crazy world. I wish I was as good looking as I was when I was 20, though.
[03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:13.400]  I remember when I used to live in Panama City Beach without a time.
[03:11:13.400 --> 03:11:18.400]  Oh my gosh. Well, I'm sure. Here's the deal. They call it perverted and they control the Christian church.
[03:11:18.400 --> 03:11:22.400]  It's not a Christian. I love God, but I'm a man. I mean, God made me. Look, all stuff King David did.
[03:11:22.400 --> 03:11:28.400]  I'm just not a hypocrite about it. It's normal that I appreciate God's creations, you know, full grown women.
[03:11:28.400 --> 03:11:31.400]  That's supposedly Christians get more upset. I'll talk about how beautiful women are.
[03:11:31.400 --> 03:11:35.400]  But then it's like they're promoting pedophilia on the news.
[03:11:35.400 --> 03:11:42.400]  And we've allowed Christians to kind of lose the moral high ground by getting so upset at like, you know, men liking women and bikinis.
[03:11:42.400 --> 03:11:49.400]  And then going out and screaming, you know, God hates fags, kill gay people to make Christians, you know, not look loving.
[03:11:49.400 --> 03:11:53.400]  And then meanwhile you give away your moral high ground and the pedophiles come out and take over.
[03:11:53.400 --> 03:11:55.400]  You don't want to see, you see what I'm saying? You see what I'm saying?
[03:11:55.400 --> 03:11:59.400]  Yeah, you don't see beekeepers in the water playing around and swatting the water and chasing after the bee.
[03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:04.400]  Well, by the way, it's true that when they put these burkinis on, in fact, I had an article on that today.
[03:12:04.400 --> 03:12:11.400]  Let's pull that up. We can't on screen. When they have these burkinis on that are literal teletubby outfits that full grown women are wearing.
[03:12:11.400 --> 03:12:15.400]  And they're out there at the beach. The French are like, but the thing is they grandstand.
[03:12:15.400 --> 03:12:22.400]  And Bracken talks about in the next phase of Islam, they do this to parade around and make you uncomfortable and see, they enjoy it.
[03:12:22.400 --> 03:12:28.400]  They get off on it. These are Stockholm syndrome enslaved women with their genitals cut off in many cases.
[03:12:28.400 --> 03:12:37.400]  But the inventor of the burkini has now come out and attacked Sarkozy, who's a bad guy, by the way, for supporting the Burkaban and said, you don't get the style.
[03:12:37.400 --> 03:12:40.400]  Can we pull up close ups of the burkinis, please?
[03:12:40.400 --> 03:12:46.400]  I mean, not just the far away shot, but these women look like they're wearing giant condoms or something.
[03:12:46.400 --> 03:12:50.400]  The one little shed like a beehive in her hand or something like that.
[03:12:50.400 --> 03:12:54.400]  Try to fill it. The holes with sand or something. They'll kill the bees, I guess.
[03:12:54.400 --> 03:13:00.400]  The point is, is that here's the deal. You come to France, the inventors of the Burkini, not much good about the French.
[03:13:00.400 --> 03:13:01.400]  How are you good at French for that?
[03:13:01.400 --> 03:13:04.400]  The French are great people, actually. They're socialist or horrible.
[03:13:04.400 --> 03:13:10.400]  Look at this. What is the point of going to the beach?
[03:13:10.400 --> 03:13:14.400]  And they'll say, oh, don't bully. These are people that want to bully my women.
[03:13:14.400 --> 03:13:19.400]  They'll say, that's sexism. Yeah, right. They're my women, my family, my daughters are mine.
[03:13:19.400 --> 03:13:23.400]  They're not putting on your damn beekeeper outfits. Ain't happening, Jack.
[03:13:23.400 --> 03:13:26.400]  We want them to be free. We want them to dress how they want to dress.
[03:13:26.400 --> 03:13:28.400]  That's because you're a racist, sexist homophobe.
[03:13:28.400 --> 03:13:31.400]  It's a homophobe, which is why I'm still alive.
[03:13:31.400 --> 03:13:34.400]  Look at this. I mean, look at this. I mean, it's a clown outfit.
[03:13:34.400 --> 03:13:35.400]  Look at that.
[03:13:35.400 --> 03:13:36.400]  I like the teletubbies.
[03:13:36.400 --> 03:13:39.400]  Look at this. Look at this.
[03:13:39.400 --> 03:13:41.400]  Hey, Anthony Goodyard. I'm going to bring you in right now.
[03:13:41.400 --> 03:13:44.400]  Oh, this is going to be like a secret photo shoot.
[03:13:44.400 --> 03:13:49.400]  Anthony, we make the joke that sunglasses, cars, and suits are all best when they're Italian and shoes and everything else.
[03:13:49.400 --> 03:13:54.400]  But I tell you, maybe we have an Italian designer of Burkinis. Would that make it okay?
[03:13:54.400 --> 03:14:00.400]  I think that must be it. And did you see that they said now if you post a picture of someone enforcing
[03:14:00.400 --> 03:14:05.400]  the Burkini law and like writing a ticket or whatever, they're going to come after you legally?
[03:14:05.400 --> 03:14:06.400]  Who is?
[03:14:06.400 --> 03:14:09.400]  The French government have the article right here.
[03:14:09.400 --> 03:14:10.400]  It says it.
[03:14:10.400 --> 03:14:12.400]  That's totally schizophrenic. Exactly.
[03:14:12.400 --> 03:14:16.400]  They tell the newspapers, okay, we're going to enforce the law that we don't want to.
[03:14:16.400 --> 03:14:18.400]  So don't show the photo. Go ahead and show the article. Here we go.
[03:14:18.400 --> 03:14:21.400]  Everything is so loaded. Perception becomes a reality.
[03:14:21.400 --> 03:14:25.400]  It's totally insane. They could just say anything they want, say you're racist, say you're homophobic.
[03:14:25.400 --> 03:14:28.400]  Yeah, it's from the Independent. I sent it to the producer.
[03:14:28.400 --> 03:14:30.400]  Yeah, let's do a document cam shot. We can show that there.
[03:14:30.400 --> 03:14:37.400]  Burkini ban. France threatens legal action against social media users for sharing photos of police enforcing law.
[03:14:37.400 --> 03:14:41.400]  So it says I am denouncing a manipulation that undermines the local police.
[03:14:41.400 --> 03:14:48.400]  And they're threatening legal action against social media users for sharing photos of police enforcing a ban on the Burkini, which is one right here.
[03:14:48.400 --> 03:14:51.400]  But it's a public place so there's no perception of privacy.
[03:14:51.400 --> 03:14:54.400]  That's my big beef with police worldwide. I get the cameras cause you problems.
[03:14:54.400 --> 03:14:56.400]  They also help you in a lot of cases.
[03:14:56.400 --> 03:14:58.400]  That'll help get rid of bad cops.
[03:14:58.400 --> 03:15:02.400]  Stop giving people tickets or arresting people that are videotaping police.
[03:15:02.400 --> 03:15:04.400]  They've backed off a lot on that in the U.S.
[03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:06.400]  That is outrageous by the French.
[03:15:06.400 --> 03:15:08.400]  I just love the ridiculousness of all of it.
[03:15:08.400 --> 03:15:10.400]  It's like, it's completely insane.
[03:15:10.400 --> 03:15:13.400]  Just like they had the Burkini-only pool days.
[03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:16.400]  And now it's like, okay, well, we're going to put this policy forward.
[03:15:16.400 --> 03:15:17.400]  But then the other side...
[03:15:17.400 --> 03:15:19.400]  Oh yeah, in Germany they have pool days just for the Muslims.
[03:15:19.400 --> 03:15:21.400]  Yeah, exactly. But now you can't even take a picture of them.
[03:15:21.400 --> 03:15:26.400]  And they have girls now in Germany where wristbands and all the pools saying, don't rape me in Arabic.
[03:15:26.400 --> 03:15:30.400]  And hey, also the Egyptian police, I couldn't print the story because it wouldn't work.
[03:15:30.400 --> 03:15:35.400]  The Egyptian police are using gay and lesbian dating apps, smartphone apps,
[03:15:35.400 --> 03:15:39.400]  and then busting the people using them and arresting them.
[03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:42.400]  But that's okay. That's fine, right?
[03:15:42.400 --> 03:15:46.400]  We're bad. Look at all the actually oppressive countries and actually oppressive people.
[03:15:46.400 --> 03:15:48.400]  They're great and we should defend their honor.
[03:15:48.400 --> 03:15:52.400]  In the United States, though, if you say something that could potentially harm someone,
[03:15:52.400 --> 03:15:53.400]  you're a really, really bad person.
[03:15:53.400 --> 03:15:54.400]  Like, you're bad. You said you're women.
[03:15:54.400 --> 03:15:57.400]  And what you meant is you actually care about the women in your life
[03:15:57.400 --> 03:16:01.400]  so you consider them so important to you that, you know, they're like your women in your life,
[03:16:01.400 --> 03:16:02.400]  like your mother or whatever.
[03:16:02.400 --> 03:16:03.400]  They're mine.
[03:16:03.400 --> 03:16:04.400]  But you're bad.
[03:16:04.400 --> 03:16:06.400]  Me and McGreen were in Eugene, Oregon.
[03:16:06.400 --> 03:16:10.400]  We were at this like whole food site place where they had these little trendy restaurants in there
[03:16:10.400 --> 03:16:11.400]  and we were covering one of the Trump rallies.
[03:16:11.400 --> 03:16:14.400]  And he was inside looking around at some of the stuff and I walked in.
[03:16:14.400 --> 03:16:17.400]  And there was this giant swarm of bees.
[03:16:17.400 --> 03:16:20.400]  But I kid you not, there's this lady in the whole Burke outfit.
[03:16:20.400 --> 03:16:21.400]  And everyone was like running from it.
[03:16:21.400 --> 03:16:24.400]  She just goes right through it, just breezes right through like nothing's eating her.
[03:16:24.400 --> 03:16:25.400]  So there's the answer.
[03:16:25.400 --> 03:16:26.400]  And she didn't get stung.
[03:16:26.400 --> 03:16:29.400]  And I was like, wow, it is a beekeeper suit.
[03:16:29.400 --> 03:16:31.400]  I was like, McGreen, look at this. It works.
[03:16:31.400 --> 03:16:33.400]  Really? Where is this video?
[03:16:33.400 --> 03:16:34.400]  No, there was no video.
[03:16:34.400 --> 03:16:37.400]  We were just walking to go get lunch and I'd seen that and there was just like thousands.
[03:16:37.400 --> 03:16:43.400]  Oh my God, you actually saw a woman in a Burka run through the, like she walked right through this bee swarm.
[03:16:43.400 --> 03:16:44.400]  I mean, there was thousands.
[03:16:44.400 --> 03:16:49.400]  And there was a guy in this other, he was an actual bee suit and he's standing up on a ladder
[03:16:49.400 --> 03:16:51.400]  and he's trying to get this nest down or hive down or whatever.
[03:16:51.400 --> 03:16:52.400]  And by the way, let me say this.
[03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:56.400]  They use our open, truly liberal society as a joke to overthrow it.
[03:16:56.400 --> 03:17:02.400]  I can't go to Saudi Arabia, okay, with my family and say have my daughters, you know,
[03:17:02.400 --> 03:17:04.400]  even a normal bathing suit or anything.
[03:17:04.400 --> 03:17:07.400]  So why can't they walk down the street with their faces uncovered?
[03:17:07.400 --> 03:17:08.400]  Why aren't they open to me?
[03:17:08.400 --> 03:17:10.400]  Why do I have to be open to them?
[03:17:10.400 --> 03:17:12.400]  Do you understand that fake liberals?
[03:17:12.400 --> 03:17:15.400]  Why do you think you're so cuckold, Anthony?
[03:17:15.400 --> 03:17:18.400]  Why does the left want to commit suicide?
[03:17:18.400 --> 03:17:19.400]  I love that word.
[03:17:19.400 --> 03:17:20.400]  You know, here's the best.
[03:17:20.400 --> 03:17:22.400]  We should be able to make a joke about anything we want.
[03:17:22.400 --> 03:17:24.400]  We should be able to talk about anything we want.
[03:17:24.400 --> 03:17:25.400]  We have a joke.
[03:17:25.400 --> 03:17:27.400]  I'm a 100% Italian and what's our joke?
[03:17:27.400 --> 03:17:31.400]  We call me Shinebox from the Goodfellas.
[03:17:31.400 --> 03:17:32.400]  They'll get your Shinebox.
[03:17:32.400 --> 03:17:33.400]  We make jokes all the time.
[03:17:33.400 --> 03:17:34.400]  Well, that is your idea to do that.
[03:17:34.400 --> 03:17:36.400]  It's my joke.
[03:17:36.400 --> 03:17:39.400]  Whenever we do something really cool or something really successful, we'll go look at this.
[03:17:39.400 --> 03:17:42.400]  Or like we're an Italian suit or something.
[03:17:42.400 --> 03:17:44.400]  Look at this damn Shinebox.
[03:17:44.400 --> 03:17:46.400]  Look at that Lamborghini, those damn Shineboxes.
[03:17:46.400 --> 03:17:47.400]  Look at these Italian sunglasses.
[03:17:47.400 --> 03:17:50.400]  Look at these Italian women, these Shineboxers.
[03:17:50.400 --> 03:17:51.400]  It's all a big joke.
[03:17:51.400 --> 03:17:52.400]  It's self-deprecating.
[03:17:52.400 --> 03:17:53.400]  It's funny.
[03:17:53.400 --> 03:17:56.400]  Because the thing is, a lot of Italians were poor, so they were the shine shoes.
[03:17:56.400 --> 03:17:58.400]  And that's in the movie Goodfellas, which is really true.
[03:17:58.400 --> 03:18:00.400]  Italians would insult each other and say,
[03:18:00.400 --> 03:18:01.400]  No, get your Shinebox.
[03:18:01.400 --> 03:18:03.400]  So we make a big joke about it.
[03:18:03.400 --> 03:18:04.400]  Right.
[03:18:04.400 --> 03:18:05.400]  It's not a big deal.
[03:18:05.400 --> 03:18:06.400]  It's funny.
[03:18:06.400 --> 03:18:07.400]  It's silly.
[03:18:07.400 --> 03:18:09.400]  It's like a helicopter to go survey something.
[03:18:09.400 --> 03:18:10.400]  And we say, look at this.
[03:18:10.400 --> 03:18:12.400]  We're getting in a Shinebox.
[03:18:12.400 --> 03:18:13.400]  Exactly.
[03:18:13.400 --> 03:18:14.400]  It's actually a good nomenclature.
[03:18:14.400 --> 03:18:15.400]  It's real.
[03:18:15.400 --> 03:18:18.400]  But you see, we can say that it's funny.
[03:18:18.400 --> 03:18:20.400]  But then you even say the word burka and people look at you.
[03:18:20.400 --> 03:18:22.400]  Oh, because that's a hot issue right now.
[03:18:22.400 --> 03:18:23.400]  Oh, how dare you.
[03:18:23.400 --> 03:18:24.400]  I hear people all the time go, let's get Mexican.
[03:18:24.400 --> 03:18:25.400]  We can't say Mexican.
[03:18:25.400 --> 03:18:26.400]  Yeah.
[03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:27.400]  Let's get Chinese.
[03:18:27.400 --> 03:18:28.400]  Chinese.
[03:18:28.400 --> 03:18:30.400]  Chinese are going to hear that.
[03:18:30.400 --> 03:18:31.400]  It's like mental illness, man.
[03:18:31.400 --> 03:18:32.400]  It is crazy.
[03:18:32.400 --> 03:18:35.400]  People asked me specifically about you talking about,
[03:18:35.400 --> 03:18:37.400]  you can't say Mexican, right?
[03:18:37.400 --> 03:18:39.400]  They were like, no one says that.
[03:18:39.400 --> 03:18:41.400]  One time we were talking with somebody.
[03:18:41.400 --> 03:18:42.400]  I don't know who it was.
[03:18:42.400 --> 03:18:45.400]  And there was someone there that said, well, don't call it Chinese food.
[03:18:45.400 --> 03:18:46.400]  What?
[03:18:46.400 --> 03:18:47.400]  What are you supposed to call it?
[03:18:47.400 --> 03:18:48.400]  What are you supposed to call it?
[03:18:48.400 --> 03:18:49.400]  What are you supposed to call it?
[03:18:49.400 --> 03:18:50.400]  I went to Chinese last night.
[03:18:50.400 --> 03:18:53.400]  It was literally, it is called Chinese food on the sign of the place.
[03:18:53.400 --> 03:18:54.400]  I'll tell the story.
[03:18:54.400 --> 03:18:55.400]  But it's a court case.
[03:18:55.400 --> 03:18:56.400]  Am I getting into it?
[03:18:56.400 --> 03:18:57.400]  It's a court case.
[03:18:57.400 --> 03:18:58.400]  I was successful.
[03:18:58.400 --> 03:18:59.400]  But this guy has stuff that goes on.
[03:18:59.400 --> 03:19:00.400]  Okay.
[03:19:00.400 --> 03:19:01.400]  I am in a court.
[03:19:01.400 --> 03:19:02.400]  Okay.
[03:19:02.400 --> 03:19:03.400]  This is this year.
[03:19:03.400 --> 03:19:04.400]  And I'm sitting there and they bring up.
[03:19:04.400 --> 03:19:10.400]  They go, and then once he said, yeah, you know, that Hispanic guy.
[03:19:10.400 --> 03:19:13.400]  And then they were asking this Hispanic, they understand.
[03:19:13.400 --> 03:19:14.400]  They go, do you think that's racist?
[03:19:14.400 --> 03:19:16.400]  And she goes, no, he was Hispanic.
[03:19:16.400 --> 03:19:20.400]  It's like, you know, that, you know, that farmer guy on the road,
[03:19:20.400 --> 03:19:22.400]  or you don't, you know, that Hispanic guy, what's his name?
[03:19:22.400 --> 03:19:25.400]  It's like, it's like literally words.
[03:19:25.400 --> 03:19:29.400]  It's like, if you say homosexual, it doesn't mean you hate gay people or heterosexual.
[03:19:29.400 --> 03:19:31.400]  It's the term.
[03:19:31.400 --> 03:19:35.400]  What if police just stopped using descriptions, which they do now, actually.
[03:19:35.400 --> 03:19:37.400]  But you know how it's like, you know, black, not gay.
[03:19:37.400 --> 03:19:38.400]  Oh no, no, no, no, no.
[03:19:38.400 --> 03:19:39.400]  They don't say that.
[03:19:39.400 --> 03:19:40.400]  You and our banning saying Muslim.
[03:19:40.400 --> 03:19:41.400]  It's just, there's a human being right now.
[03:19:41.400 --> 03:19:42.400]  There's an active, active shooter situation right now.
[03:19:42.400 --> 03:19:44.400]  There's a human being on the loose.
[03:19:44.400 --> 03:19:45.400]  Find him.
[03:19:45.400 --> 03:19:46.400]  He looks like a human being.
[03:19:46.400 --> 03:19:47.400]  Don't say the color was, we gave him a safe to car.
[03:19:47.400 --> 03:19:48.400]  Don't say he.
[03:19:48.400 --> 03:19:49.400]  What's the vehicle description?
[03:19:49.400 --> 03:19:50.400]  I'm wrong.
[03:19:50.400 --> 03:19:51.400]  He's driving a Birka.
[03:19:51.400 --> 03:19:52.400]  What color is he?
[03:19:52.400 --> 03:19:53.400]  What color is he identified as with?
[03:19:53.400 --> 03:19:54.400]  You gave a safe.
[03:19:54.400 --> 03:19:55.400]  He's wearing a beaky pursuit.
[03:19:55.400 --> 03:19:58.400]  They're wearing a Teletubby outfit.
[03:19:58.400 --> 03:19:59.400]  They're at the beach.
[03:19:59.400 --> 03:20:02.040]  It's a woman in a teletubbie outfit with a suicide bar.
[03:20:02.040 --> 03:20:04.560]  Are you happy watching your hands with harsh chemicals?
[03:20:04.560 --> 03:20:06.720]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[03:20:06.720 --> 03:20:08.680]  Are you happy paying high prices?

[03:21:01.360 --> 03:21:03.680]  There's nothing convenient about shaving.

[03:22:13.600 --> 03:22:15.640]  in a long-term EMP blackout?
[03:22:15.640 --> 03:22:17.760]  Using tested military designs,

[03:23:04.600 --> 03:23:06.600]  Attention, all women who have been diagnosed
[03:23:06.600 --> 03:23:07.840]  with ovarian cancer.
[03:23:07.840 --> 03:23:09.880]  In February and May 2016,
[03:23:09.880 --> 03:23:11.520]  Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder
[03:23:11.520 --> 03:23:15.800]  was ordered to pay $72 million and $55 million
[03:23:15.800 --> 03:23:19.120]  by two juries to two women who contracted ovarian cancer
[03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:22.000]  after years of using the Talcom Baby Powder product.
[03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:23.560]  Multiple studies show that women
[03:23:23.560 --> 03:23:25.480]  who have long-term use of talcom powder
[03:23:25.480 --> 03:23:28.080]  in products such as baby powder for feminine hygiene
[03:23:28.080 --> 03:23:30.920]  can increase the risk of contracting ovarian cancer.
[03:23:30.920 --> 03:23:32.280]  If you or a family member
[03:23:32.280 --> 03:23:34.280]  have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer
[03:23:34.280 --> 03:23:36.920]  and used talcom powder prior to the diagnosis
[03:23:36.920 --> 03:23:39.120]  called Talcom Baby Powder Alert Today,
[03:23:39.120 --> 03:23:41.840]  you may be entitled to substantial compensation.
[03:23:41.840 --> 03:23:43.320]  The consultation is free
[03:23:43.320 --> 03:23:45.560]  and you'll pay nothing unless you receive a settlement.
[03:23:45.560 --> 03:23:48.760]  So if you or a loved one used talcom baby powder products
[03:23:48.760 --> 03:23:52.080]  before being diagnosed with or died from ovarian cancer,
[03:23:52.080 --> 03:23:54.160]  make this important free call today.
[03:23:54.160 --> 03:23:57.120]  Call 1-800-588-7342.
[03:23:57.120 --> 03:23:59.920]  1-800-588-7342.
[03:24:02.400 --> 03:24:04.960]  Well, you were sleeping.
[03:24:04.960 --> 03:24:06.520]  Hey, I want to be clear.
[03:24:06.520 --> 03:24:09.840]  If religious groups want to cover themselves up
[03:24:09.840 --> 03:24:13.320]  and not be out there in a bikini saying,
[03:24:13.320 --> 03:24:16.280]  hey, I'm ready to mate and find a man,
[03:24:16.280 --> 03:24:19.320]  that's totally reasonable, like the Amish and folks.
[03:24:19.320 --> 03:24:20.840]  My issue is with the Islamists,
[03:24:20.840 --> 03:24:23.160]  this is part of a law, part of being conquered,
[03:24:23.160 --> 03:24:25.880]  part of coming in, they make the women do this.
[03:24:25.880 --> 03:24:26.840]  The Amish let you leave.
[03:24:26.840 --> 03:24:28.560]  In fact, they push you out for a year
[03:24:28.560 --> 03:24:31.000]  and say, maybe we don't want you.
[03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:31.960]  You know, when you're a teenager,
[03:24:31.960 --> 03:24:33.520]  right at that time to make your decision,
[03:24:33.520 --> 03:24:35.360]  it's not that way with the Islamists.
[03:24:37.160 --> 03:24:38.760]  Push freedom.
[03:24:38.760 --> 03:24:39.760]  If you want to do that,
[03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:41.920]  then you should make that decision yourself
[03:24:41.920 --> 03:24:42.760]  and carry that out.
[03:24:42.760 --> 03:24:44.760]  But we're not bad criticizing the burqas.
[03:24:44.760 --> 03:24:45.920]  We have that right.
[03:24:45.920 --> 03:24:47.120]  We're criticizing the fact
[03:24:47.120 --> 03:24:49.400]  that women are being forced to do this.
[03:24:49.400 --> 03:24:50.920]  And many of them don't want to.
[03:24:50.920 --> 03:24:54.680]  In Iran, there's a huge campaign going on right now.
[03:24:54.680 --> 03:24:57.160]  Men in burqas or something like that is a hashtag.
[03:24:57.160 --> 03:24:59.320]  And men are actually putting on these outfits
[03:24:59.320 --> 03:25:00.840]  and letting the women dress in regular
[03:25:00.840 --> 03:25:03.280]  conservative clothing in support of this,
[03:25:03.280 --> 03:25:06.520]  pointing out the ridiculousness of this whole law in Iran.
[03:25:06.520 --> 03:25:07.960]  Yeah, you know, we ought to have a day here
[03:25:07.960 --> 03:25:09.200]  where people want to opt into it,
[03:25:09.200 --> 03:25:11.640]  where men all wear burqas on air.
[03:25:11.640 --> 03:25:12.640]  And we just cover our,
[03:25:12.640 --> 03:25:15.960]  we just see how it feels to be wearing a frickin' Halloween mask.
[03:25:15.960 --> 03:25:19.160]  Four hours of beef.
[03:25:19.160 --> 03:25:20.560]  Finally get to wear a dress.
[03:25:21.760 --> 03:25:23.600]  Hey, Anthony Gutiarty.
[03:25:24.640 --> 03:25:26.120]  Biggs is gonna ride shotgun with him,
[03:25:26.120 --> 03:25:27.080]  because I know you invited him too.
[03:25:27.080 --> 03:25:28.280]  He's got some other clips he's gonna play
[03:25:28.280 --> 03:25:29.760]  and cover a bunch of news you've gotten ready
[03:25:29.760 --> 03:25:30.960]  for the show with.
[03:25:30.960 --> 03:25:33.480]  But since Biggs mentioned this,
[03:25:33.480 --> 03:25:35.920]  new international policing protocol,
[03:25:35.920 --> 03:25:37.920]  it's international, our orders come from,
[03:25:37.920 --> 03:25:39.880]  international, all these alphabet groups
[03:25:39.880 --> 03:25:41.480]  run by the same globalist.
[03:25:41.480 --> 03:25:44.280]  Jolt-linked terror attacks to Islam or ISIS.
[03:25:44.280 --> 03:25:47.840]  Protocol 12 is beyond even what Obama says,
[03:25:47.840 --> 03:25:50.160]  which is official, that when they're investigating a mosque,
[03:25:50.160 --> 03:25:52.480]  they can't say mosque, Islam, Muhammad,
[03:25:52.480 --> 03:25:54.120]  they can't ask those questions.
[03:25:54.120 --> 03:25:56.080]  Actually, there's like a list of 15 things.
[03:25:56.080 --> 03:25:58.320]  Well, now globalists use Protocol 12
[03:25:58.320 --> 03:26:00.520]  to cover up jihadist attacks in the West,
[03:26:00.520 --> 03:26:02.240]  and they're just not even allowed to say it's Islamic.
[03:26:02.240 --> 03:26:03.680]  In fact, they can't even go investigate
[03:26:03.680 --> 03:26:06.360]  the Islamic centers, because it isn't Islamic.
[03:26:06.360 --> 03:26:09.320]  ISIS, that's the thing that has nothing to do with Islam.
[03:26:09.320 --> 03:26:10.600]  The next time there's a terror attack,
[03:26:10.600 --> 03:26:12.520]  we should take the article that breaks down,
[03:26:12.520 --> 03:26:13.720]  we should take the article that breaks down
[03:26:13.720 --> 03:26:16.320]  all the information and black out with a sharpie,
[03:26:16.320 --> 03:26:19.720]  any kind of word like that, you know, Islam, this and that,
[03:26:19.720 --> 03:26:21.440]  and then just read it out and be like, you know,
[03:26:21.440 --> 03:26:23.920]  a man walked into a, from a bubble.
[03:26:23.920 --> 03:26:25.760]  Another 50 people were killed in Turkey today
[03:26:25.760 --> 03:26:28.080]  in a daily suicide bombing,
[03:26:28.080 --> 03:26:29.960]  but it has nothing to do with Islam.
[03:26:32.360 --> 03:26:34.160]  Meanwhile, you know what's really powerful to watch
[03:26:34.160 --> 03:26:37.040]  is the video of the women who were freed
[03:26:37.040 --> 03:26:39.760]  from the Islamic State, captured in whatever town they were in
[03:26:39.760 --> 03:26:41.400]  in whatever country.
[03:26:41.400 --> 03:26:44.120]  And basically, ISIS had taken over their little town,
[03:26:44.120 --> 03:26:47.120]  and they took off the burqas and they were burning them,
[03:26:47.120 --> 03:26:48.960]  and they were crying, and they were like,
[03:26:48.960 --> 03:26:50.400]  oh my God, it feels so amazing to be freed here.
[03:26:50.400 --> 03:26:53.880]  Hey, that's not for your white savior crap, okay?
[03:26:53.880 --> 03:26:56.080]  You're a white male, you're not allowed to talk, shut up.
[03:26:56.080 --> 03:26:57.520]  I know, but how dare we talk about that?
[03:26:57.520 --> 03:26:59.560]  All evil founts from you, Gujiardi.
[03:26:59.560 --> 03:27:00.400]  It does, actually.
[03:27:00.400 --> 03:27:02.800]  Just think about how many women out there despise that,
[03:27:02.800 --> 03:27:05.720]  that want to be able to have that freedom,
[03:27:05.720 --> 03:27:07.040]  to choose what they want to do.
[03:27:07.040 --> 03:27:09.720]  Look at these women burning these hot,
[03:27:09.720 --> 03:27:10.920]  hudged they've got to wear.
[03:27:12.160 --> 03:27:14.240]  I've had to wear that stuff before.
[03:27:14.240 --> 03:27:17.040]  It's some of these skits, it's not comfortable.
[03:27:17.040 --> 03:27:20.320]  I mean, look at it, and then people say,
[03:27:20.320 --> 03:27:22.160]  well, it's their choice.
[03:27:22.160 --> 03:27:24.600]  Completely free of the West where I felt safe.
[03:27:25.880 --> 03:27:28.040]  You do a great aid screel-ex.
[03:27:28.040 --> 03:27:29.200]  No, no, that's Carl the Cuckoo.
[03:27:29.200 --> 03:27:31.280]  But you do aid screel-ex earlier.
[03:27:31.280 --> 03:27:32.120]  That was on point.
[03:27:32.120 --> 03:27:34.720]  I had to bend forward like I was a buzzard when I talked, though.
[03:27:34.720 --> 03:27:36.040]  Carl the Cuckoo's hard.
[03:27:36.040 --> 03:27:37.960]  Here, let me go ahead and try it, hold on.
[03:27:37.960 --> 03:27:40.480]  Never go full Alex Jennings, I'm about to do it.
[03:27:40.480 --> 03:27:43.360]  I hate the Western world.
[03:27:43.360 --> 03:27:46.680]  I want to crap all over Western values.
[03:27:46.680 --> 03:27:48.680]  I'm going to join ISIS.
[03:27:48.680 --> 03:27:50.800]  Yeah, yeah, me too.
[03:27:50.800 --> 03:27:52.160]  Oh, that'll be great.
[03:27:52.160 --> 03:27:53.480]  And me.
[03:27:53.480 --> 03:27:55.400]  I think that was on point.
[03:27:55.400 --> 03:27:57.200]  I can tell you've watched it a few times.
[03:27:57.200 --> 03:27:58.440]  Yeah.
[03:27:58.440 --> 03:28:00.360]  Are you kidding me?
[03:28:00.360 --> 03:28:02.000]  We only watched it five times a day at once.
[03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:03.200]  I know, I know.
[03:28:03.200 --> 03:28:05.160]  It's very, it should be given to all children.
[03:28:05.160 --> 03:28:06.160]  It's something with gay fish.
[03:28:06.160 --> 03:28:09.800]  Oh, I'm going to tell you, we watched gay fish a lot.
[03:28:15.800 --> 03:28:17.840]  I'm not trying to do a morning comedy show.
[03:28:17.840 --> 03:28:19.360]  At a certain point, I'm so serious,
[03:28:19.360 --> 03:28:21.920]  I like break down into gallows humor.
[03:28:21.920 --> 03:28:23.320]  And it's just going to get worse now.
[03:28:23.320 --> 03:28:24.520]  It's about 2 AM this morning.
[03:28:24.520 --> 03:28:27.560]  I can tell you, I'm thinking I'm going to go crazy there.
[03:28:27.560 --> 03:28:29.440]  Today, you're going to go crazy today, huh?
[03:28:29.440 --> 03:28:31.080]  We're going to have to go to the shine box.
[03:28:31.080 --> 03:28:34.480]  Go to the shine box operation over here.
[03:28:34.480 --> 03:28:36.400]  I know, I'm all alone in this shine box over here.
[03:28:36.400 --> 03:28:38.640]  There are all the secrets in it.
[03:28:38.640 --> 03:28:43.000]  I know, I revealed too much on this program today.
[03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:45.360]  Oh, secretly getting orders from the Vatican?
[03:28:45.360 --> 03:28:45.760]  Yes.
[03:28:45.760 --> 03:28:48.560]  Or is it Israel today?
[03:28:48.560 --> 03:28:50.720]  The truth is, no one's getting any orders around here.
[03:28:50.720 --> 03:28:52.920]  That's why it's so bad and so good.
[03:28:52.920 --> 03:28:53.640]  That's the problem.
[03:28:53.640 --> 03:28:55.520]  How many orders are happening around here?
[03:28:55.520 --> 03:28:57.640]  I'm told to, hey, what do you want to cover?
[03:28:57.640 --> 03:28:58.720]  And go cover it.
[03:28:58.720 --> 03:29:00.360]  You know, if you're going to talk about something
[03:29:00.360 --> 03:29:02.160]  or bring up something that's happened in the country,
[03:29:02.160 --> 03:29:03.560]  go shoot a report.
[03:29:03.560 --> 03:29:04.560]  Go talk about it.
[03:29:04.560 --> 03:29:06.000]  Give your viewpoint on it.
[03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:07.640]  Meanwhile, other media is micromanaged
[03:29:07.640 --> 03:29:10.000]  because there's always a corporate message they want out.
[03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:11.120]  Yeah.
[03:29:11.120 --> 03:29:14.080]  We literally do have more freedom here
[03:29:14.080 --> 03:29:15.400]  to cover the things we care about,
[03:29:15.400 --> 03:29:18.160]  to cover the things we want to, to cover these hot topics that
[03:29:18.160 --> 03:29:21.000]  are unfolding, the breaking news without anyone standing
[03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:21.760]  over our shoulder.
[03:29:21.760 --> 03:29:23.840]  And if you want to randomly act like aid screenings,
[03:29:23.840 --> 03:29:26.320]  you can and just suddenly say, ISIS!
[03:29:26.320 --> 03:29:30.000]  That's the group that has literally nothing to do with Islam!
[03:29:30.000 --> 03:29:30.600]  Sorry.
[03:29:30.600 --> 03:29:33.040]  When I cross the Rio Grande River dressed up
[03:29:33.040 --> 03:29:35.640]  like an ISIS hotty, that's an idea that popped to my head
[03:29:35.640 --> 03:29:36.280]  and I called do.
[03:29:36.280 --> 03:29:37.640]  I was like, do you think this is a good idea?
[03:29:37.640 --> 03:29:38.360]  He's like, go for it!
[03:29:38.360 --> 03:29:39.000]  Do it!
[03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:39.880]  Show the open border.
[03:29:39.880 --> 03:29:42.320]  Yeah, those stuff, we're really like original investigative
[03:29:42.320 --> 03:29:44.080]  reporting, and we're actually with sources and stuff.
[03:29:44.080 --> 03:29:45.960]  Then we have to meet about that a lot and stuff.
[03:29:45.960 --> 03:29:48.040]  We have to vet all that, make phone calls and things.
[03:29:48.040 --> 03:29:51.360]  But other than that, we're just doing a commentary analysis.
[03:29:51.360 --> 03:29:52.960]  We're going to come back, stay with us.
[03:29:52.960 --> 03:29:54.920]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.920 --> 03:29:57.360]  Alex, you're going to photoshop tell-it-all to the antennas
[03:29:57.360 --> 03:29:58.560]  on top of those Burkini's, though.
[03:29:58.560 --> 03:29:59.760]  It's happening right now.
[03:29:59.760 --> 03:30:00.840]  Nothing's going to stop us.
[03:30:00.840 --> 03:30:01.960]  We're putting it out, French.
[03:30:01.960 --> 03:30:04.640]  Once again, the top leading news site in the world,
[03:30:04.640 --> 03:30:07.000]  the Drudge Report, is putting Hillary Clinton's health
[03:30:07.000 --> 03:30:09.800]  to test, with a scathing new slew of articles detailing
[03:30:09.800 --> 03:30:12.800]  funny business, as well as bad health indicators.
[03:30:12.800 --> 03:30:15.680]  Hypothyroidism is the latest Hillary health issue,
[03:30:15.680 --> 03:30:18.600]  as well as revelations that she was unfit to fly commercial
[03:30:18.600 --> 03:30:22.280]  in 2009, so she felt the need to request Air Force One.
[03:30:22.280 --> 03:30:24.960]  WikiLeaks recently leaked emails tying Hillary Clinton
[03:30:24.960 --> 03:30:26.880]  to decision fatigue disorder.
[03:30:26.880 --> 03:30:29.560]  Last week and yesterday, Infowars.com
[03:30:29.560 --> 03:30:32.280]  discussed Clinton's potential ties to Parkinson's,
[03:30:32.280 --> 03:30:36.240]  given her use of a drug, Provigil, as well as Comedine,
[03:30:36.240 --> 03:30:38.800]  a very serious and dangerous blood thinner.
[03:30:38.800 --> 03:30:41.160]  Not only health issues, but underhanded shenanigans
[03:30:41.160 --> 03:30:44.320]  were also exposed in recent emails leaked from WikiLeaks,
[03:30:44.320 --> 03:30:46.760]  showing that Chelsea Clinton was using a fake name
[03:30:46.760 --> 03:30:48.360]  when emailing her mother, Hillary.
[03:30:48.360 --> 03:30:50.760]  More deleted emails with Huma Abedim have leaked,
[03:30:50.760 --> 03:30:53.080]  who was in charge of covering for the Clinton Foundation
[03:30:53.080 --> 03:30:54.240]  money laundering scam.
[03:30:54.240 --> 03:30:56.720]  Be sure to share these news stories with friends and family
[03:30:56.720 --> 03:30:58.760]  before the Clinton Foundation deletes them.
[03:30:58.760 --> 03:31:01.920]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[03:31:01.920 --> 03:31:06.120]  Introducing vitamin mineral fusion from InfowarsLife.com.
[03:31:06.120 --> 03:31:08.760]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists
[03:31:08.760 --> 03:31:11.000]  to create the most powerful and affordable,
[03:31:11.000 --> 03:31:13.560]  great tasting multivitamin formula available.
[03:31:13.560 --> 03:31:16.240]  The all new vitamin mineral fusion drink mix
[03:31:16.240 --> 03:31:20.200]  at InfowarsLife.com is loaded with a full month supply
[03:31:20.200 --> 03:31:22.960]  of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids

[03:31:24.960 --> 03:31:26.720]  In the history of Infowars Life,
[03:31:26.720 --> 03:31:29.000]  we brought out a lot of amazing products
[03:31:29.000 --> 03:31:31.800]  like Survival Shield X2, SuperMell Vitality,
[03:31:31.800 --> 03:31:32.840]  and so many others.
[03:31:32.840 --> 03:31:36.720]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today
[03:31:36.720 --> 03:31:38.360]  with its unique delivery system
[03:31:38.360 --> 03:31:40.480]  and proprietary manufacturing process
[03:31:40.480 --> 03:31:42.480]  designed for maximized effects.
[03:31:42.480 --> 03:31:44.920]  This formula is the platinum standard
[03:31:44.920 --> 03:31:46.920]  of multivitamin mineral products.
[03:31:46.920 --> 03:31:49.440]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion
[03:31:49.440 --> 03:31:53.280]  are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab
[03:31:53.280 --> 03:31:54.000]  standard.
[03:31:54.000 --> 03:31:56.640]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure,
[03:31:56.640 --> 03:31:59.520]  that's InfowarsLife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[03:31:59.520 --> 03:32:01.600]  Take action now before we sell out.
[03:32:01.600 --> 03:32:03.320]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:32:03.320 --> 03:32:04.800]  You can't survive without it.
[03:32:04.800 --> 03:32:05.920]  But where do you get it?
[03:32:05.920 --> 03:32:08.880]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new ground-breaking
[03:32:08.880 --> 03:32:10.840]  gravity-fed water filtration system
[03:32:10.840 --> 03:32:11.960]  that is like no other.
[03:32:11.960 --> 03:32:14.240]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water
[03:32:14.240 --> 03:32:16.040]  from virtually any fresh source
[03:32:16.040 --> 03:32:17.880]  into clean, healthy drinking water,
[03:32:17.880 --> 03:32:20.600]  pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power

[03:33:03.240 --> 03:33:16.800]  He aligns himself with the truth,
[03:33:16.800 --> 03:33:19.760]  and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:33:19.760 --> 03:33:23.400]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:23.400 --> 03:33:28.360]  I see your hell is burning.
[03:33:28.360 --> 03:33:30.520]  We have major breaking news here,
[03:33:30.520 --> 03:33:34.000]  as we're live on the air at 2.33 Central Time,
[03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:35.680]  just a few minutes ago,
[03:33:35.680 --> 03:33:39.680]  because we were getting ready to go to her speech
[03:33:39.680 --> 03:33:41.840]  as she was concluding it,
[03:33:41.840 --> 03:33:45.280]  Hillary Clinton in this big event
[03:33:45.280 --> 03:33:47.240]  that she's been talking about for so long,
[03:33:47.240 --> 03:33:49.080]  where she was gonna expose Donald Trump,
[03:33:49.080 --> 03:33:51.720]  she came out with more half-truths,
[03:33:51.720 --> 03:33:55.440]  lies, innuendo, hypocrisy,
[03:33:55.440 --> 03:33:57.320]  where we've got all these videos of her saying,
[03:33:57.320 --> 03:33:59.360]  build a wall, build a fence,
[03:33:59.360 --> 03:34:01.640]  deport felons, deport illegals.
[03:34:01.640 --> 03:34:04.200]  She said it in the 90s, she said it in the 2000s,
[03:34:04.200 --> 03:34:06.520]  she said it in 2008, running against Obama.
[03:34:06.520 --> 03:34:08.040]  It's all lies about Trump.
[03:34:08.040 --> 03:34:12.360]  It's all twisted, spin, half-baked BS.
[03:34:12.360 --> 03:34:14.000]  And then she did it to me.
[03:34:14.000 --> 03:34:17.720]  And I'm the big, you know, you don't say Alex Jones.
[03:34:17.720 --> 03:34:20.200]  You never say the name Alex Jones.
[03:34:20.200 --> 03:34:22.280]  They always say the one from Texas,
[03:34:22.280 --> 03:34:25.400]  which is so honorable, I'm known as the Texan, thank God.
[03:34:25.400 --> 03:34:26.680]  That's right, Slime.
[03:34:26.680 --> 03:34:28.320]  And we're here standing against you,
[03:34:28.320 --> 03:34:29.760]  we don't care, we're committed.
[03:34:30.840 --> 03:34:33.840]  But more and more, they have to speak the name
[03:34:33.840 --> 03:34:37.040]  that no one says, it's like, in Lord of the Rings,
[03:34:37.040 --> 03:34:39.240]  he says, Sauronix, Sauronix.
[03:34:39.240 --> 03:34:41.560]  Oh, who said the name?
[03:34:41.560 --> 03:34:43.200]  I mean, they will not even speak it.
[03:34:43.200 --> 03:34:45.520]  I love it that they won't speak my name.
[03:34:45.520 --> 03:34:49.080]  In fact, this bums me out, that Hillary,
[03:34:49.080 --> 03:34:51.280]  the arch-criminal is actually speaking my name.
[03:34:51.280 --> 03:34:55.280]  It loses some of the mystique to be the unspoken one.
[03:34:55.280 --> 03:34:58.560]  But let me get serious because I'm gonna respond
[03:34:58.560 --> 03:35:01.120]  to this live here on air right now.
[03:35:01.120 --> 03:35:03.520]  Hillary Clinton just minutes ago concluded,
[03:35:03.520 --> 03:35:07.280]  while we were live on air at 235 currently,
[03:35:07.280 --> 03:35:09.920]  Hillary Clinton just concluded her live speech
[03:35:09.920 --> 03:35:13.480]  where she was gonna destroy the KKK,
[03:35:13.480 --> 03:35:16.360]  Kingpin Donald Trump.
[03:35:16.360 --> 03:35:20.200]  The problem is, we have her saying one of her main mentors
[03:35:20.200 --> 03:35:23.640]  was Senator Robert Byrd, who was a grand dragon
[03:35:23.640 --> 03:35:27.160]  and a supreme cyclops and all these other stupid
[03:35:27.160 --> 03:35:29.680]  comic book names the KKK has for themselves.
[03:35:29.680 --> 03:35:30.920]  All bedsheets.
[03:35:30.920 --> 03:35:33.320]  It's really weird, it's a gang.
[03:35:33.320 --> 03:35:34.960]  You think just black people and Mexicans
[03:35:34.960 --> 03:35:36.240]  or whatever have gangs?
[03:35:36.240 --> 03:35:39.160]  The KKK is a white gang, okay, of degenerates.
[03:35:39.160 --> 03:35:40.960]  I mean, everybody's got their own degenerates.
[03:35:40.960 --> 03:35:42.360]  And that's what's going on.
[03:35:42.360 --> 03:35:45.040]  So Trump has disavowed over and over again.
[03:35:45.040 --> 03:35:47.280]  She goes into that, she goes into everything else.
[03:35:47.280 --> 03:35:48.920]  She's saying shut down Breitbart.
[03:35:48.920 --> 03:35:50.480]  I mean, these are open statements,
[03:35:50.480 --> 03:35:52.960]  very dangerous tyranny and she goes on to say,
[03:35:55.880 --> 03:35:58.440]  it's what happens when you listen to the radio host
[03:35:58.440 --> 03:36:00.760]  Alex Jones, who claims that 9-11
[03:36:00.760 --> 03:36:03.480]  and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[03:36:03.480 --> 03:36:05.720]  He said the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre
[03:36:05.720 --> 03:36:08.720]  were child actors and no one was actually killed there.
[03:36:08.720 --> 03:36:10.560]  Now let's stop right there.
[03:36:10.560 --> 03:36:13.360]  Because that's lies and twisted disinformation.
[03:36:14.640 --> 03:36:18.880]  I said the Saudi Arabian government helped fund
[03:36:19.720 --> 03:36:22.640]  15 of the 19 hijackers and I said that there was
[03:36:22.640 --> 03:36:27.640]  a congressional investigation in 2002 that found
[03:36:28.280 --> 03:36:31.880]  that Saudi Arabia quarterbacked the 9-11 attacks
[03:36:31.880 --> 03:36:35.320]  and that bipartisanly high levels of the government
[03:36:35.320 --> 03:36:38.360]  blocked that investigation and blocked the FBI
[03:36:38.360 --> 03:36:41.960]  for even stopping the hijackers before it happened
[03:36:41.960 --> 03:36:44.200]  because of the Saudi connection.
[03:36:44.200 --> 03:36:45.800]  And they basically stood down.
[03:36:45.800 --> 03:36:50.800]  Now, I was interviewing the whistleblowers and FBI people
[03:36:51.200 --> 03:36:53.640]  back in 2002, three, four, five.
[03:36:53.640 --> 03:36:56.320]  I was having members of the CFR on and others,
[03:36:56.320 --> 03:36:58.800]  high level former spy chiefs like Dr. Pachennick.
[03:36:58.800 --> 03:37:02.600]  I mean, I had my sources, but it was in the news
[03:37:02.600 --> 03:37:04.000]  that Saudi Arabia was involved.
[03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:05.920]  It just came back up with 28 pages
[03:37:05.920 --> 03:37:06.880]  and has been proven correct.
[03:37:06.880 --> 03:37:11.880]  So they condensed it down to like a Warner Brothers cartoon
[03:37:12.040 --> 03:37:14.840]  where I'm saying George W. Bush had the plunger
[03:37:14.840 --> 03:37:15.960]  blowing up the buildings.
[03:37:15.960 --> 03:37:18.040]  In fact, that's what hardball always says.
[03:37:18.040 --> 03:37:20.520]  Joan says Bush literally had a detonator
[03:37:20.520 --> 03:37:22.560]  and like Wiley Kyle blew it up.
[03:37:22.560 --> 03:37:23.880]  That's what they say.
[03:37:23.880 --> 03:37:25.720]  I didn't get that analogy from myself.
[03:37:25.720 --> 03:37:27.040]  They say that.
[03:37:27.040 --> 03:37:28.440]  I didn't say that.
[03:37:28.440 --> 03:37:30.680]  I said Bush was literally not even like the president.
[03:37:30.680 --> 03:37:31.520]  It was Dick Cheney.
[03:37:31.520 --> 03:37:33.200]  It was much more sophisticated than that
[03:37:33.200 --> 03:37:34.360]  and it's all come out.
[03:37:34.360 --> 03:37:35.640]  Now let's talk about Oklahoma City.
[03:37:35.640 --> 03:37:37.200]  Let's talk about Oklahoma City.
[03:37:38.240 --> 03:37:43.240]  Oklahoma City was a total false flag with NATO,
[03:37:45.200 --> 03:37:49.720]  the ATF and the CIA and the FBI.
[03:37:49.720 --> 03:37:51.520]  And we know the names of the men
[03:37:51.520 --> 03:37:53.360]  from the witnesses in the building,
[03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:55.400]  from the police officers,
[03:37:55.400 --> 03:37:59.280]  and from the declassified information that came out,
[03:37:59.280 --> 03:38:00.280]  the bombs in the building.
[03:38:00.280 --> 03:38:02.200]  General Parton, the former head of Air Force Weapons,
[03:38:02.200 --> 03:38:04.280]  he went public about the bombs being inside,
[03:38:04.280 --> 03:38:05.960]  the outside being in diversion.
[03:38:05.960 --> 03:38:09.400]  It goes on and on and on.
[03:38:09.400 --> 03:38:12.200]  And so yes, that was a false flag.
[03:38:12.200 --> 03:38:14.160]  And you ask, why do they use foreign agencies?
[03:38:14.160 --> 03:38:15.400]  That way they're all involved.
[03:38:15.400 --> 03:38:17.520]  Nobody can blackmail the others.
[03:38:17.520 --> 03:38:19.400]  And it's been declassified that the London Guardians
[03:38:19.400 --> 03:38:21.840]  reported the Germans have been caught doing bombings
[03:38:21.840 --> 03:38:23.480]  to blame right-wing grips as well
[03:38:23.480 --> 03:38:26.160]  as a national program in the 90s.
[03:38:26.160 --> 03:38:28.600]  They also, the British got caught leading the IRA.
[03:38:28.600 --> 03:38:29.640]  They actually led it from the top.
[03:38:29.640 --> 03:38:31.320]  The IRA didn't even know for decades.
[03:38:31.320 --> 03:38:32.480]  And it was the British government
[03:38:32.480 --> 03:38:35.440]  ordering the IRA to bomb to discredit the IRA.
[03:38:35.440 --> 03:38:37.920]  That is London Guardian Associated Press, BBC,
[03:38:37.920 --> 03:38:38.760]  look at it for yourself.
[03:38:38.760 --> 03:38:42.240]  So yes, I do say that was a false flag completely.
[03:38:42.240 --> 03:38:44.200]  There's different types of false flags.
[03:38:44.200 --> 03:38:46.880]  And then they say that I say Sandy Hook Massacre,
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:49.040]  none of it happened.
[03:38:50.200 --> 03:38:53.320]  There have been top school safety experts
[03:38:53.320 --> 03:38:55.280]  that have come out and said that it's a cover up.
[03:38:55.280 --> 03:38:57.440]  There have been major anomalies like Anderson Cooper
[03:38:57.440 --> 03:39:00.640]  using blue screen when he's not really at Sandy Hook.
[03:39:00.640 --> 03:39:04.160]  And we've seen CNN claiming that they were in Riyadh
[03:39:04.160 --> 03:39:05.680]  under a scut attack when they weren't.
[03:39:05.680 --> 03:39:06.920]  Remember that's famous.
[03:39:06.920 --> 03:39:08.720]  I just said it should be investigated.
[03:39:08.720 --> 03:39:11.320]  Clearly the whole story doesn't add up.
[03:39:11.320 --> 03:39:13.800]  Some people say it's old child actors.
[03:39:13.800 --> 03:39:15.640]  Some people say all this.
[03:39:15.640 --> 03:39:16.920]  That's not what I'm saying.
[03:39:16.920 --> 03:39:18.720]  There was a drill that day.
[03:39:18.720 --> 03:39:20.560]  A lot of weird stuff went on.
[03:39:20.560 --> 03:39:22.680]  So that's what I'm getting at here.
[03:39:22.680 --> 03:39:24.640]  Now, Joe Biggs was in here alive in studio
[03:39:24.640 --> 03:39:26.000]  breaking down other news with us.
[03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:27.120]  We're gonna go back to him in a moment
[03:39:27.120 --> 03:39:28.720]  and Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:39:28.720 --> 03:39:31.080]  But I wanted to go ahead now that we have the clip
[03:39:31.080 --> 03:39:35.520]  and play Hillary Clinton now planning to use Alex Jones
[03:39:35.520 --> 03:39:37.360]  as an attack on Trump.
[03:39:37.360 --> 03:39:40.800]  And again, this is meant to have him not use
[03:39:40.800 --> 03:39:42.960]  key airmo against Hillary like,
[03:39:42.960 --> 03:39:44.720]  hey, there might be election fraud.
[03:39:44.720 --> 03:39:46.480]  Well, now the U.N. is coming to oversee the election
[03:39:46.480 --> 03:39:47.760]  saying there was gonna be election fraud.
[03:39:47.760 --> 03:39:48.920]  Trump's been proven right again.
[03:39:48.920 --> 03:39:50.520]  We're covering real things.
[03:39:50.520 --> 03:39:53.240]  And she wants to illustrate this and act like.
[03:39:53.240 --> 03:39:54.400]  She's scared of the alt-right.
[03:39:54.400 --> 03:39:56.160]  She's scared of the alternative right news.
[03:39:56.160 --> 03:39:57.480]  That's what she's going after.
[03:39:57.480 --> 03:40:00.640]  She thinks that us being out here exposing all this,
[03:40:00.640 --> 03:40:02.640]  she's trying to push this whole conspiracy thing
[03:40:02.640 --> 03:40:06.360]  to take away from the fact that we really are exposing
[03:40:06.360 --> 03:40:08.240]  criminal activity that's going on.
[03:40:08.240 --> 03:40:09.880]  Well, sure, and they misrepresent.
[03:40:09.880 --> 03:40:11.560]  I mean, the truth is, I'm proud that I said
[03:40:11.560 --> 03:40:13.760]  there was something going on in 9-11, including the dust.
[03:40:13.760 --> 03:40:15.720]  And they now admit it was deadly and they covered it up.
[03:40:15.720 --> 03:40:16.560]  I was right about that.
[03:40:16.560 --> 03:40:18.280]  I mean, this is common sense.
[03:40:18.280 --> 03:40:21.000]  Oklahoma City was totally a false flag.
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:24.680]  World Net Daily got the hotel receipts
[03:40:24.680 --> 03:40:26.640]  of the head of the FBI hostage rescue team
[03:40:26.640 --> 03:40:30.080]  there days before at, you know, the hotel
[03:40:30.080 --> 03:40:32.320]  and his whole team, he said he was in Dallas
[03:40:32.320 --> 03:40:33.800]  and didn't get there till that afternoon.
[03:40:33.800 --> 03:40:34.640]  I mean, we have it.
[03:40:34.640 --> 03:40:37.800]  We have the witnesses that saw him, identified him on TV.
[03:40:37.800 --> 03:40:39.880]  These guys were crazy enough to go plant bombs
[03:40:39.880 --> 03:40:42.680]  in the building and then go do press conferences
[03:40:42.680 --> 03:40:43.840]  at the bomb site.
[03:40:44.720 --> 03:40:46.480]  And the people that were working in the federal building
[03:40:46.480 --> 03:40:49.400]  were like, that's the guy planting the bombs.
[03:40:49.400 --> 03:40:50.560]  I've had all the witnesses on.
[03:40:50.560 --> 03:40:52.320]  Jane Graham, all of them.
[03:40:52.320 --> 03:40:54.880]  You know, I've had the cops on the ones they didn't kill
[03:40:54.880 --> 03:40:56.760]  and tortured to death.
[03:40:56.760 --> 03:40:58.120]  And you know, it was right on the show then
[03:40:58.120 --> 03:41:00.400]  within 10 minutes, Oklahoma City bombing.
[03:41:00.400 --> 03:41:03.040]  Who did Hitlery and Bill Clinton blame?
[03:41:03.040 --> 03:41:04.800]  Rush Limbaugh and talk radio.
[03:41:04.800 --> 03:41:08.040]  And then later, you know, Matt Drudge and everybody,
[03:41:08.040 --> 03:41:10.280]  they're coming after the press folks
[03:41:10.280 --> 03:41:11.560]  and they're scared of us.
[03:41:11.560 --> 03:41:13.400]  So they want to have this fake moral authority
[03:41:13.400 --> 03:41:15.240]  like they're up there on the high mountain going
[03:41:15.240 --> 03:41:17.800]  and he talks to the Cooke, Alex Jones.
[03:41:17.800 --> 03:41:20.000]  And in the desert, he goes to an oasis
[03:41:20.000 --> 03:41:20.960]  and drinks good water.
[03:41:20.960 --> 03:41:22.200]  What a Cooke.
[03:41:22.200 --> 03:41:24.360]  I mean, this is, see these people,
[03:41:24.360 --> 03:41:26.480]  see that's why they admit now they want to censor us.
[03:41:26.480 --> 03:41:27.840]  And that's why they said Breitbart
[03:41:27.840 --> 03:41:30.880]  and other grassroots conservative media
[03:41:30.880 --> 03:41:35.840]  has no right to exist because we're kicking your butt
[03:41:35.840 --> 03:41:38.480]  with the information because it's the internet age.
[03:41:38.480 --> 03:41:41.400]  We can show you, say, build a wall 15 times
[03:41:41.400 --> 03:41:44.920]  and then say, Trump's a bigot because he wants to build a wall.
[03:41:44.920 --> 03:41:48.400]  We can show what a fraud you are, lady.
[03:41:48.400 --> 03:41:50.440]  By the way, she looked like hell.
[03:41:50.440 --> 03:41:52.640]  Like she was propped up during this press conference.
[03:41:52.640 --> 03:41:55.240]  There it is.
[03:41:55.240 --> 03:41:56.080]  There she is, our queenie.
[03:41:56.080 --> 03:41:59.800]  The Kennedy assassination.
[03:41:59.800 --> 03:42:04.400]  Now, perhaps in Trump's mind, because Mr. Cruz was
[03:42:04.400 --> 03:42:07.720]  a Cuban immigrant, he must have had something to do with it.
[03:42:07.720 --> 03:42:08.600]  Let's hit pause.
[03:42:08.600 --> 03:42:09.080]  And there is.
[03:42:09.080 --> 03:42:09.840]  Let's hit pause.
[03:42:09.840 --> 03:42:10.960]  No, his dad lived there.
[03:42:10.960 --> 03:42:14.600]  His dad was connected to serious organizations and groups.
[03:42:14.600 --> 03:42:17.120]  And you notice his dad, the whole thing got dropped a day
[03:42:17.120 --> 03:42:18.520]  later, see, all of it is alive.
[03:42:18.520 --> 03:42:20.400]  See, we consider analyze all of it.
[03:42:20.400 --> 03:42:21.200]  All of it is alive.
[03:42:21.200 --> 03:42:25.360]  Now, he doesn't like immigrants because Ted Cruz came
[03:42:25.360 --> 03:42:26.440]  from immigrants.
[03:42:26.440 --> 03:42:30.920]  No, we have the intel and we have the girlfriend
[03:42:30.920 --> 03:42:34.760]  of Lee Harvey Oswald, who was CIA, saying, no, I knew Cruz.
[03:42:34.760 --> 03:42:36.120]  And then he's in photos.
[03:42:36.120 --> 03:42:37.840]  He's a very distinctive looking guy.
[03:42:37.840 --> 03:42:39.800]  It looks like Rafael Cruz.
[03:42:39.800 --> 03:42:42.240]  And let me explain something.
[03:42:42.240 --> 03:42:46.320]  Most of the Cubans that came in in the year before all
[03:42:46.320 --> 03:42:48.760]  that stuff kicked off, that's when Cruz came in,
[03:42:48.760 --> 03:42:50.840]  were working for the CIA.
[03:42:50.840 --> 03:42:54.760]  The CIA is bigger than Walmart and Coca-Cola combined.
[03:42:54.760 --> 03:42:56.600]  I go to family reunions and I'm even proud of it
[03:42:56.600 --> 03:42:58.840]  because I built everything myself.
[03:42:58.840 --> 03:43:01.280]  It's not cool to be in the CIA.
[03:43:01.280 --> 03:43:04.120]  And my family, it's not like analysts and people
[03:43:04.120 --> 03:43:05.400]  and pencil pushers.
[03:43:05.400 --> 03:43:08.320]  It's like the Legion of Doom with eye patches.
[03:43:08.320 --> 03:43:09.800]  And I'm not even proud of that.
[03:43:09.800 --> 03:43:12.400]  The point is, is that I know CIA when I see it.
[03:43:12.400 --> 03:43:13.720]  And that's Rafael Cruz.
[03:43:13.720 --> 03:43:15.160]  Go ahead.
[03:43:15.160 --> 03:43:17.280]  Yeah, I mean, she's doing everything she can
[03:43:17.280 --> 03:43:20.040]  to divert the attention away from the emails,
[03:43:20.040 --> 03:43:22.160]  to divert the attention away from her failing health.
[03:43:22.160 --> 03:43:26.040]  And she's trying to use this to blame you,
[03:43:26.040 --> 03:43:28.720]  to blame Judge, to blame Breitbart.
[03:43:28.720 --> 03:43:30.920]  And it's completely and totally pathetic.
[03:43:30.920 --> 03:43:33.800]  We have stacks and stacks of paper every day
[03:43:33.800 --> 03:43:36.680]  showing the criminality behind the Clinton Foundation,
[03:43:36.680 --> 03:43:38.600]  showing her failing health, showing
[03:43:38.600 --> 03:43:41.520]  that she doesn't have the ability to hold the highest
[03:43:41.520 --> 03:43:45.120]  office that we have in the US as president.
[03:43:45.120 --> 03:43:46.120]  And she wants to attack you.
[03:43:46.120 --> 03:43:48.480]  That's like, it's such a low blow.
[03:43:48.480 --> 03:43:51.080]  Well, look, look, it's because they're scared of the info.
[03:43:51.080 --> 03:43:53.080]  They're reverse psychology and political agree with us.
[03:43:53.080 --> 03:43:55.120]  He's former top scyops, the State Department.
[03:43:55.120 --> 03:43:57.120]  I'm going to get him on tomorrow if you can come on.
[03:43:57.120 --> 03:43:58.120]  Let's get him on.
[03:43:58.120 --> 03:43:59.680]  Is that whatever they're really afraid of,
[03:43:59.680 --> 03:44:01.960]  they put out there like it's been discredited.
[03:44:01.960 --> 03:44:03.760]  It's a Jedi mind trick, you understand?
[03:44:03.760 --> 03:44:04.260]  Yeah.
[03:44:04.260 --> 03:44:06.480]  But Trump sees all that and is countermanding
[03:44:06.480 --> 03:44:07.560]  his staff continually.
[03:44:07.560 --> 03:44:08.840]  And I can say that.
[03:44:08.840 --> 03:44:10.480]  I mean, look, Trump is on board.
[03:44:10.480 --> 03:44:12.240]  The problem is, it's hard to find people
[03:44:12.240 --> 03:44:15.680]  at that level for the political class that aren't idiots.
[03:44:15.680 --> 03:44:18.000]  OK, but let's, I'm sorry.
[03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:19.960]  I digress with her talking about Ted Cruz,
[03:44:19.960 --> 03:44:23.080]  because every line is just a load of disinformation.
[03:44:23.080 --> 03:44:25.320]  See, it took me five minutes just to decipher
[03:44:25.320 --> 03:44:27.200]  that steaming pile of horse manure.
[03:44:27.200 --> 03:44:30.400]  Let's go back to the source of the deception,
[03:44:30.400 --> 03:44:32.560]  the creature known as Hillary.
[03:44:32.560 --> 03:44:36.080]  Of that, just recently, Trump claimed
[03:44:36.080 --> 03:44:39.760]  that President Obama founded ISIS.
[03:44:39.760 --> 03:44:41.080]  He said, you did too.
[03:44:41.080 --> 03:44:43.200]  And he has repeated that over and over again.
[03:44:43.200 --> 03:44:44.880]  Because you did, Winch.
[03:44:44.880 --> 03:44:52.000]  His latest paranoid fever dream is about my health.
[03:44:52.000 --> 03:44:54.960]  And the giant diaper you're wearing.
[03:44:54.960 --> 03:44:59.360]  And all I can say is, Donald, dream on.
[03:44:59.360 --> 03:45:00.360]  Ha ha, dream on.
[03:45:00.360 --> 03:45:01.360]  I see sick in your eyes.
[03:45:01.360 --> 03:45:04.240]  He's been taking naps for the last three days.
[03:45:04.240 --> 03:45:06.440]  Look at that barracuda, man.
[03:45:06.440 --> 03:45:07.880]  Look at that demon.
[03:45:07.880 --> 03:45:09.360]  Man, oh, man, I can't handle her.
[03:45:09.360 --> 03:45:10.360]  Woo!
[03:45:10.360 --> 03:45:11.600]  Look at the bags under her eyes.
[03:45:11.600 --> 03:45:14.720]  The next, uh, back.
[03:45:14.720 --> 03:45:17.000]  He could literally starve the new Batman as a joker.
[03:45:17.000 --> 03:45:18.000]  No makeup needed.
[03:45:18.000 --> 03:45:20.600]  But my friends, this is what happens
[03:45:20.600 --> 03:45:26.040]  when you treat the national inquirer like gospel.
[03:45:26.040 --> 03:45:30.400]  They said in October I'd be dead in six months.
[03:45:30.400 --> 03:45:33.880]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host
[03:45:33.880 --> 03:45:38.840]  Alex Jones, who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City
[03:45:38.840 --> 03:45:41.880]  bombings were inside jobs.
[03:45:41.880 --> 03:45:48.000]  He even said, and this really just is so disgusting,
[03:45:48.000 --> 03:45:51.600]  he even said the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre
[03:45:51.600 --> 03:45:53.560]  were child actors.
[03:45:53.560 --> 03:45:56.400]  And no one was actually killed there.
[03:45:56.400 --> 03:46:00.040]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind
[03:46:00.040 --> 03:46:03.320]  or how dark their heart must be.
[03:46:03.320 --> 03:46:04.960]  Wow.
[03:46:04.960 --> 03:46:06.240]  To say things like that.
[03:46:06.240 --> 03:46:07.440]  How dark my heart must be.
[03:46:07.440 --> 03:46:09.440]  But trust doesn't challenge these lies.
[03:46:09.440 --> 03:46:10.120]  She loves my heart.
[03:46:10.120 --> 03:46:12.160]  He actually went on Jones' show and said,
[03:46:12.160 --> 03:46:13.360]  Empire's never seen such giant plump jeans.
[03:46:13.360 --> 03:46:15.000]  Your reputation is amazing.
[03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:17.360]  I will not let you down.
[03:46:17.360 --> 03:46:18.360]  Let's back her up.
[03:46:18.360 --> 03:46:19.960]  Man, I didn't know from the transcript
[03:46:19.960 --> 03:46:21.400]  she went on a whole rant about me.
[03:46:21.400 --> 03:46:22.720]  Back this up.
[03:46:22.720 --> 03:46:23.640]  Wow.
[03:46:23.640 --> 03:46:24.800]  My black heart.
[03:46:24.800 --> 03:46:26.200]  Hey, baby.
[03:46:26.200 --> 03:46:28.320]  Big, juicy, and red, and you know it.
[03:46:28.320 --> 03:46:29.360]  And not afraid.
[03:46:29.360 --> 03:46:31.080]  And that's what she can't stand.
[03:46:31.080 --> 03:46:31.640]  Wow.
[03:46:31.640 --> 03:46:33.160]  I was watching some of it earlier in the break,
[03:46:33.160 --> 03:46:34.640]  and she didn't look that animated and that angry.
[03:46:34.640 --> 03:46:36.880]  When she starts talking about me, she like,
[03:46:36.880 --> 03:46:39.320]  these people it must be like, we've got the red button ready
[03:46:39.320 --> 03:46:40.360]  to pull the trigger on me.
[03:46:40.360 --> 03:46:42.320]  Just, oh, can it make me great?
[03:46:42.320 --> 03:46:44.520]  Oh, boy, just water the tree.
[03:46:44.520 --> 03:46:46.000]  Boom, boom.
[03:46:46.000 --> 03:46:49.120]  I mean, I don't want to die, but let me tell you.
[03:46:49.120 --> 03:46:50.680]  Wave those rancheros right here.
[03:46:50.680 --> 03:46:54.320]  I mean, I am born to bring you down, lady.
[03:46:54.320 --> 03:46:55.960]  So I'm a little bug, huh?
[03:46:55.960 --> 03:46:58.120]  Step on me.
[03:46:58.120 --> 03:47:03.240]  Oh, my god, this is ecstasy, actually.
[03:47:03.240 --> 03:47:05.480]  I didn't say there was child actors.
[03:47:05.480 --> 03:47:07.240]  We've had guests that say that had debates
[03:47:07.240 --> 03:47:10.440]  and had the other guy that says it's all real on.
[03:47:10.440 --> 03:47:12.280]  We've had debates, like CNN does.
[03:47:12.280 --> 03:47:13.760]  You know, people saying nothing happened,
[03:47:13.760 --> 03:47:15.400]  and people saying it all happened.
[03:47:15.400 --> 03:47:17.520]  I mean, we've really got her here.
[03:47:17.520 --> 03:47:20.240]  Because on Oklahoma City, I did say it's a stage.
[03:47:20.240 --> 03:47:21.720]  I mean, I know the names of the bombers.
[03:47:21.720 --> 03:47:23.160]  Would you like me to tell you?
[03:47:23.160 --> 03:47:24.800]  I've had the head of the Canine Squad that
[03:47:24.800 --> 03:47:25.800]  was there two minutes after.
[03:47:25.800 --> 03:47:26.840]  He knows all of them.
[03:47:26.840 --> 03:47:29.200]  They came to his office and said, we're going to kill you.
[03:47:29.200 --> 03:47:30.440]  His name's Don Browning.
[03:47:30.440 --> 03:47:33.480]  He's in Oklahoma City, decorated Marine Corps veteran
[03:47:33.480 --> 03:47:34.840]  and head of the Canine Unit.
[03:47:34.840 --> 03:47:39.000]  You want, oh, oh, you don't want to talk to Don Browning
[03:47:39.000 --> 03:47:45.000]  that saw the NATO op, the FBI operator, the CIA operator,
[03:47:45.000 --> 03:47:46.600]  the ATF operator?
[03:47:46.600 --> 03:47:48.120]  And that kind of hands these agencies.
[03:47:48.120 --> 03:47:50.920]  They had high level guys, heads of departments
[03:47:50.920 --> 03:47:52.560]  stringing the gray sticks of butter.
[03:47:52.560 --> 03:47:54.160]  She's like, what are you doing in the stairwell?
[03:47:54.160 --> 03:47:56.920]  They're like, oh, telephone work, dear.
[03:47:56.920 --> 03:47:58.640]  And I remember she says, Jane Graham said,
[03:47:58.640 --> 03:48:00.400]  I was struck by how handsome they were.
[03:48:00.400 --> 03:48:02.320]  And so she was like, well, what are you guys doing?
[03:48:02.320 --> 03:48:05.120]  She was, I guess, they were like, I'm going to move along, sweetheart.
[03:48:05.120 --> 03:48:09.040]  We're doing some important work right now.
[03:48:09.040 --> 03:48:12.840]  Oh, and you had the deputy attorney general at the time,
[03:48:12.840 --> 03:48:15.160]  running the operation.
[03:48:15.160 --> 03:48:18.120]  Sorry, let's back it up and go back to it.
[03:48:18.120 --> 03:48:18.640]  Here it is.
[03:48:21.880 --> 03:48:26.080]  Never were ready with Hillary.
[03:48:26.080 --> 03:48:28.000]  Maybe we've lost audio, I'm not sure.
[03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:29.600]  We had audio earlier, but sometimes we
[03:48:29.600 --> 03:48:30.320]  were doing these DVRs.
[03:48:30.320 --> 03:48:31.800]  They do this.
[03:48:31.800 --> 03:48:32.720]  So you guys got the audio?
[03:48:32.720 --> 03:48:35.080]  Both must be.
[03:48:35.080 --> 03:48:37.440]  To say things like that.
[03:48:37.440 --> 03:48:39.440]  But Trump doesn't challenge these liars.
[03:48:39.440 --> 03:48:40.600]  No, no, I want to back it up, guys.
[03:48:40.600 --> 03:48:41.400]  He actually went on, Joe.
[03:48:41.400 --> 03:48:42.880]  I want to back it up.
[03:48:42.880 --> 03:48:44.960]  Back it up to the start, like back it up a minute.
[03:48:44.960 --> 03:48:48.000]  That is the most, that is ambrosia.
[03:48:48.000 --> 03:48:52.840]  I mean, the liar, the criminal, the founder of ISIS
[03:48:52.840 --> 03:48:55.520]  that brought al-Qaeda into Syria, that murdered hundreds
[03:48:55.520 --> 03:48:58.000]  of thousands of Christians with her co-founder
[03:48:58.000 --> 03:49:01.160]  at the Legion of Doom, Obama, these horrible demons.
[03:49:01.160 --> 03:49:04.480]  And she's talking about my black heart.
[03:49:04.480 --> 03:49:07.200]  My heart is so big and red and juicy.
[03:49:07.200 --> 03:49:09.520]  I do this for love, lady.
[03:49:09.520 --> 03:49:13.200]  I don't do this to count a bunch of $30,000 a person
[03:49:13.200 --> 03:49:15.360]  per plate to come hang out with her.
[03:49:15.360 --> 03:49:17.160]  Oh my god.
[03:49:17.160 --> 03:49:18.880]  It's not that I'm being recognized by them.
[03:49:18.880 --> 03:49:20.880]  I mean, they run media matters that
[03:49:20.880 --> 03:49:23.160]  attacks me every day now.
[03:49:23.160 --> 03:49:25.600]  They attack me all over the CNN, MSNBC.
[03:49:25.600 --> 03:49:29.440]  But to have the demon itself try to turn info wars
[03:49:29.440 --> 03:49:32.640]  into some weapon that's going to bring down Trump,
[03:49:32.640 --> 03:49:34.680]  when of course Trump's winning by a landslide.
[03:49:34.680 --> 03:49:35.760]  They are panicking.
[03:49:35.760 --> 03:49:37.280]  They are completely freaking out.
[03:49:37.280 --> 03:49:40.040]  Okay, do we have the DVR queued up now?
[03:49:40.040 --> 03:49:40.880]  Here we go.
[03:49:40.880 --> 03:49:41.720]  Here it is.
[03:49:44.520 --> 03:49:47.040]  And he has repeated that over and over again.
[03:49:48.320 --> 03:49:53.320]  His latest paranoid fever dream is about my health.
[03:49:54.840 --> 03:49:56.560]  Yeah, I must get the break.
[03:49:56.560 --> 03:49:58.440]  This would be a day long remember.
[03:49:58.440 --> 03:50:01.520]  And all I can say is Donald Dremon.
[03:50:01.520 --> 03:50:04.480]  Oh, I got that smile.
[03:50:04.480 --> 03:50:05.720]  She looks like family members a mile
[03:50:05.720 --> 03:50:08.520]  after they've been dead a couple of days, lying on the slab.
[03:50:08.520 --> 03:50:10.320]  Those gums are coming back off those teeth, aren't they,
[03:50:10.320 --> 03:50:11.160]  sweetie?
[03:50:11.160 --> 03:50:12.560]  That's the goal once they get out of there.
[03:50:12.560 --> 03:50:13.680]  All my friends.
[03:50:15.800 --> 03:50:19.280]  Yeah, I've got so much energy and just power surging.
[03:50:19.280 --> 03:50:20.120]  I love God.
[03:50:20.120 --> 03:50:20.960]  I love some nice things.
[03:50:20.960 --> 03:50:22.320]  I'm going to run up to him and give her an injection.
[03:50:22.320 --> 03:50:23.160]  Here we go.
[03:50:23.160 --> 03:50:24.840]  This is what happens when you treat
[03:50:24.840 --> 03:50:27.640]  the national inquirer like gospel.
[03:50:27.640 --> 03:50:29.480]  No, that said your husband was Monica Lewinsky.
[03:50:29.480 --> 03:50:32.520]  They said in October I'd be dead in six months.
[03:50:32.520 --> 03:50:33.840]  And you look like you are.
[03:50:33.840 --> 03:50:36.040]  It's also what happens when you listen
[03:50:36.040 --> 03:50:39.120]  to the radio host, Alex Jones,
[03:50:39.120 --> 03:50:42.920]  who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings
[03:50:42.920 --> 03:50:45.320]  were inside jobs.
[03:50:45.320 --> 03:50:50.320]  He even said, and this really just is so disgusting.
[03:50:51.400 --> 03:50:55.120]  He even said the victims of the Sandy Hook Massacre
[03:50:55.120 --> 03:50:59.840]  were child actors, and no one was actually killed there.
[03:50:59.840 --> 03:51:03.640]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind
[03:51:03.640 --> 03:51:05.200]  or how dark a heart is.
[03:51:05.200 --> 03:51:06.040]  I don't know, how'd you say that?
[03:51:06.040 --> 03:51:08.440]  I just didn't call those Christians, I don't know.
[03:51:08.440 --> 03:51:09.280]  To say things like that.
[03:51:09.280 --> 03:51:10.840]  I didn't say that.
[03:51:10.840 --> 03:51:13.520]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[03:51:13.520 --> 03:51:16.640]  He actually went on Jones's show and said,
[03:51:16.640 --> 03:51:18.480]  your reputation is amazing.
[03:51:18.480 --> 03:51:20.200]  I will not let you down.
[03:51:20.200 --> 03:51:21.760]  They hate that.
[03:51:21.760 --> 03:51:25.560]  This from the man who wants to be president of the United States.
[03:51:25.560 --> 03:51:29.480]  You know, I've stood by President Obama's side
[03:51:29.480 --> 03:51:31.520]  as he made the toughest decisions
[03:51:31.520 --> 03:51:34.400]  a commander-in-chief has to make.
[03:51:34.400 --> 03:51:36.120]  When she said my name, so people cheered.
[03:51:36.120 --> 03:51:39.640]  Our country depends on steady leadership.
[03:51:39.640 --> 03:51:40.480]  Clear thinking.
[03:51:40.480 --> 03:51:42.160]  You don't go too steady, lady.
[03:51:42.160 --> 03:51:43.000]  Because one wrong move.
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:44.320]  She said she needed a Parkinson's drug
[03:51:44.320 --> 03:51:45.440]  because she couldn't think clearly.
[03:51:45.440 --> 03:51:48.040]  We have your email winch, and more is coming, more is coming.
[03:51:48.040 --> 03:51:48.880]  You can stop.
[03:51:48.880 --> 03:51:52.320]  Because you will fall, la, la, la.
[03:51:52.320 --> 03:51:54.320]  She said she had a crack head.
[03:51:54.320 --> 03:51:56.000]  Oh, this is so good.
[03:51:56.000 --> 03:51:58.000]  Oh, this is so good.
[03:51:58.000 --> 03:51:59.000]  We'll look at her.
[03:51:59.000 --> 03:52:00.560]  Tell the difference, or doesn't care.
[03:52:00.560 --> 03:52:01.960]  Help me, um, we could.
[03:52:01.960 --> 03:52:04.520]  Between fact and fiction.
[03:52:04.520 --> 03:52:09.080]  And who buys so easily into racially tinned rumors.
[03:52:09.080 --> 03:52:14.520]  I have to wait for this a long time.
[03:52:14.520 --> 03:52:17.640]  Someone so detached from reality
[03:52:17.640 --> 03:52:20.040]  should never be in charge of making decisions
[03:52:20.040 --> 03:52:21.040]  that are real.
[03:52:21.040 --> 03:52:22.040]  That's coming.
[03:52:22.040 --> 03:52:23.040]  I'm serious.
[03:52:23.040 --> 03:52:25.040]  Oh, my nose is so good.
[03:52:25.040 --> 03:52:27.680]  That is yet another reason why Donald Trump
[03:52:27.680 --> 03:52:30.720]  said we can't mentally unfit to be
[03:52:30.720 --> 03:52:32.520]  president of the United States.
[03:52:37.000 --> 03:52:41.960]  Now, I hear and I read some people who are saying,
[03:52:41.960 --> 03:52:45.120]  well, his bluster and his bigotry is just
[03:52:45.120 --> 03:52:48.000]  over the campaign rhetoric.
[03:52:48.000 --> 03:52:51.080]  An outrageous person saying outrageous things for a time.
[03:52:51.080 --> 03:52:52.520]  I realize her spirit is so weak,
[03:52:52.520 --> 03:52:53.880]  and I don't care what they do to me.
[03:52:53.880 --> 03:52:55.000]  I'm with the spirit that's good.
[03:52:55.000 --> 03:52:55.500]  I love it.
[03:52:55.500 --> 03:52:56.440]  Oh, it's so good.
[03:52:56.440 --> 03:52:57.800]  Trump has proposed.
[03:52:57.800 --> 03:53:00.040]  He says Trump's detached from reality.
[03:53:00.040 --> 03:53:01.680]  Into practice.
[03:53:01.680 --> 03:53:03.920]  And don't be distracted by your leaders.
[03:53:03.920 --> 03:53:04.840]  That's what they say in the Bible,
[03:53:04.840 --> 03:53:06.560]  when the devil's locked up for 1,000 years,
[03:53:06.560 --> 03:53:07.600]  somebody can look at him.
[03:53:07.600 --> 03:53:10.400]  If I just say this, did all that.
[03:53:10.400 --> 03:53:12.520]  But we know where he stands.
[03:53:12.520 --> 03:53:15.400]  He would form a deportation force to round up
[03:53:15.400 --> 03:53:18.960]  millions of immigrants and kick them out of the country.
[03:53:18.960 --> 03:53:20.800]  He'd have kicked them out of the country,
[03:53:20.800 --> 03:53:22.480]  just like their countries do.
[03:53:22.480 --> 03:53:24.640]  That says, if you're born in the United States,
[03:53:24.640 --> 03:53:25.720]  you're an American citizen.
[03:53:25.720 --> 03:53:26.560]  Hey, can we?
[03:53:26.560 --> 03:53:28.120]  We have to take this clip and then go back when
[03:53:28.120 --> 03:53:29.280]  she used to say the opposite.
[03:53:29.280 --> 03:53:29.880]  Exactly.
[03:53:29.880 --> 03:53:33.880]  Oh, my god, she's targeting low information people, man.
[03:53:33.880 --> 03:53:35.520]  Millions of them.
[03:53:35.520 --> 03:53:39.160]  He's banned Muslims around the world from entering our country.
[03:53:39.160 --> 03:53:39.480]  I can't.
[03:53:39.480 --> 03:53:41.040]  Well, Anthony, you want to pop in here.
[03:53:41.040 --> 03:53:42.040]  I'm sorry.
[03:53:42.040 --> 03:53:43.880]  This is, I feel five years younger, though.
[03:53:43.880 --> 03:53:46.000]  This is like a, they're into bloodshed.
[03:53:46.000 --> 03:53:47.520]  This is a shoulder, and I'm just into this.
[03:53:47.520 --> 03:53:48.960]  Yesterday, Paul was tweeting out,
[03:53:48.960 --> 03:53:50.720]  wonder if Hillary Clinton will even mention this
[03:53:50.720 --> 03:53:52.720]  in tomorrow's alt-right speech.
[03:53:52.720 --> 03:53:54.840]  And sure enough, here you go.
[03:53:54.840 --> 03:53:56.360]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[03:53:56.360 --> 03:53:57.280]  Number one.
[03:53:57.280 --> 03:53:58.800]  The Death Star is orbiting the planet.
[03:53:58.800 --> 03:54:00.440]  The Death Star is orbiting the planet.
[03:54:00.440 --> 03:54:01.480]  I'm ready to fire.
[03:54:01.480 --> 03:54:04.480]  Congratulations, because this means
[03:54:04.480 --> 03:54:07.440]  that they have tried all other options of ignoring you
[03:54:07.440 --> 03:54:08.280]  and everything you're doing.
[03:54:08.280 --> 03:54:10.280]  And now they've got to actually approach the crack of doom.
[03:54:10.280 --> 03:54:14.680]  And now they are issuing the Sauron statement, Voldemort,
[03:54:14.680 --> 03:54:17.480]  the one who will not be named, because people will Google you.
[03:54:17.480 --> 03:54:19.040]  And I bet you look at the trends right now.
[03:54:19.040 --> 03:54:21.680]  It's just crazy, and people are going to the website.
[03:54:21.680 --> 03:54:24.600]  And also, though, we have been distracted.
[03:54:24.600 --> 03:54:26.080]  They just drank hemlock.
[03:54:26.080 --> 03:54:27.680]  Check this out, though.
[03:54:27.680 --> 03:54:29.960]  We are debating her points.
[03:54:29.960 --> 03:54:32.720]  She can't debate our points, so she's taking things
[03:54:32.720 --> 03:54:35.200]  you didn't even say 15 years ago, skewing them,
[03:54:35.200 --> 03:54:36.800]  and then putting that up, right?
[03:54:36.800 --> 03:54:39.160]  So, and now everyone will hear what I really said and agree with.
[03:54:39.160 --> 03:54:39.880]  Exactly.
[03:54:39.880 --> 03:54:41.360]  You need to challenge Hillary.
[03:54:41.360 --> 03:54:42.920]  I mean, Anderson Cooper's up there with his face
[03:54:42.920 --> 03:54:44.920]  disappearing at Sandy Hook with his,
[03:54:44.920 --> 03:54:46.400]  and I'm like, what the hell is this?
[03:54:46.400 --> 03:54:48.760]  You have to do a breakdown and a thorough analysis of this.
[03:54:48.760 --> 03:54:50.600]  You should do a response and challenge her
[03:54:50.600 --> 03:54:52.680]  to talk about all the things that you brought up
[03:54:52.680 --> 03:54:55.200]  instead of attacking you with Ad Haman and BS
[03:54:55.200 --> 03:54:57.440]  from 15-year-old twisted statements.
[03:54:57.440 --> 03:55:00.840]  If she actually could defend one thing you said, she would,
[03:55:00.840 --> 03:55:02.520]  but she can't, so she has to use your illusion.
[03:55:02.520 --> 03:55:04.440]  No, she's giving talking points to the media
[03:55:04.440 --> 03:55:06.160]  of what to go out and say I said.
[03:55:06.160 --> 03:55:07.080]  Oh, of course, exactly.
[03:55:07.080 --> 03:55:08.680]  Well, it's like I said that she has a tumor
[03:55:08.680 --> 03:55:11.680]  the size of a watermelon, and I said it was a joke.
[03:55:11.680 --> 03:55:13.600]  I said they're lying and saying Trump's behind the polls
[03:55:13.600 --> 03:55:14.960]  and dropping out.
[03:55:14.960 --> 03:55:16.080]  It's not true.
[03:55:16.080 --> 03:55:17.000]  Like, it's not true.
[03:55:17.000 --> 03:55:19.800]  I say she has a tumor the size of a watermelon.
[03:55:19.800 --> 03:55:20.920]  And then they've had articles saying
[03:55:20.920 --> 03:55:23.480]  Jones says she has a giant brain tumor.
[03:55:23.480 --> 03:55:25.400]  I mean, these people are just complete jokes.
[03:55:25.400 --> 03:55:27.160]  Well, what happens if they can't actually
[03:55:27.160 --> 03:55:28.880]  argue with the real stuff you say?
[03:55:28.880 --> 03:55:30.360]  They have to say that you, you know,
[03:55:30.360 --> 03:55:33.160]  they'll take a picture of you doing a funny face or something.
[03:55:33.160 --> 03:55:34.040]  It's just standard BS, right?
[03:55:34.040 --> 03:55:34.880]  Well, it's the same thing when they like it.
[03:55:34.880 --> 03:55:35.520]  Well, they also do this.
[03:55:35.520 --> 03:55:37.800]  I see media say Jones has Nazi stuff behind him.
[03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:41.400]  It's Obamacare next to Hitler, a bunch of Anthony back up,
[03:55:41.400 --> 03:55:42.800]  saying that's bad.
[03:55:42.800 --> 03:55:44.160]  But see, that's what they do.
[03:55:44.160 --> 03:55:46.000]  Yeah, of course, because they can't actually
[03:55:46.000 --> 03:55:46.840]  argue with your points.
[03:55:46.840 --> 03:55:48.840]  Well, they can never even actually have a discussion
[03:55:48.840 --> 03:55:49.840]  based on anything.
[03:55:49.840 --> 03:55:50.560]  Alex, you were a Hitler.
[03:55:50.560 --> 03:55:52.640]  Yeah, and it was the same thing when we go debate
[03:55:52.640 --> 03:55:55.040]  these social justice warriors at these events.
[03:55:55.040 --> 03:55:56.920]  They never have anything to say, but all they can do
[03:55:56.920 --> 03:55:59.680]  is say sexist, racist, lomaphobic, transphobic.
[03:55:59.680 --> 03:56:00.760]  And that's all they have.
[03:56:00.760 --> 03:56:02.480]  And all they can say against you is they go,
[03:56:02.480 --> 03:56:04.440]  Alex, Jones, a conspiracy theorist,
[03:56:04.440 --> 03:56:05.520]  but they won't actually go with it.
[03:56:05.520 --> 03:56:06.360]  You said who's Alex Jones?
[03:56:06.360 --> 03:56:07.120]  They go, we don't know.
[03:56:07.120 --> 03:56:09.680]  We were told by the people who paid us to be here.
[03:56:09.680 --> 03:56:11.160]  But look, they're so dumb.
[03:56:11.160 --> 03:56:12.240]  They're stuck in the old system.
[03:56:12.240 --> 03:56:14.280]  She's like Frank Underwood from House of Cards.
[03:56:14.280 --> 03:56:16.000]  She's like an 80s politician.
[03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:18.520]  She doesn't understand the Streisand effect.
[03:56:18.520 --> 03:56:21.800]  She attacking you is going to make you bigger and stronger.
[03:56:21.800 --> 03:56:23.200]  Help me, I'm weak, right?
[03:56:23.200 --> 03:56:25.000]  And then you're going to actually come back
[03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:26.600]  with more content delivered to her.
[03:56:26.600 --> 03:56:29.600]  And all the people that are Googling you from her side
[03:56:29.600 --> 03:56:31.000]  saying, who is this global person?
[03:56:31.000 --> 03:56:33.560]  They're going to say, wow, actually, all of this makes sense.
[03:56:33.560 --> 03:56:36.160]  So it's 100% a victory, major success.
[03:56:36.160 --> 03:56:38.400]  She doesn't understand that those weighted words
[03:56:38.400 --> 03:56:39.760]  have no actual weight.
[03:56:39.760 --> 03:56:41.960]  It's all just weird things where she thinks she can say,
[03:56:41.960 --> 03:56:44.400]  conspiracy, bad person.
[03:56:44.400 --> 03:56:45.400]  She looks worse than ever, man.
[03:56:45.400 --> 03:56:46.520]  She looks drugged up.
[03:56:46.520 --> 03:56:49.040]  She looks like a corpse they're propping up.
[03:56:49.040 --> 03:56:50.360]  She probably had to go through like the whole thing.
[03:56:50.360 --> 03:56:51.600]  Everyone who follows her is so dumb,
[03:56:51.600 --> 03:56:52.440]  they're not going to look at it.
[03:56:52.440 --> 03:56:54.640]  You know those NBA players come off the court
[03:56:54.640 --> 03:56:56.160]  and everyone's like high-fiving them?
[03:56:56.160 --> 03:56:58.520]  She's going through and they're just jabbing her with shots
[03:56:58.520 --> 03:57:01.240]  to kind of boost her up so she can get to the stage.
[03:57:01.240 --> 03:57:02.080]  Like, all right, we don't.
[03:57:02.080 --> 03:57:03.320]  She's an Iron Maiden of needles.
[03:57:03.320 --> 03:57:05.280]  She's an Iron Maiden of like 50 needles.
[03:57:05.280 --> 03:57:07.360]  It's like when you go through basic trading or whatever,
[03:57:07.360 --> 03:57:08.200]  it was just like,
[03:57:08.200 --> 03:57:09.760]  It's like a Mars attack when the Martians jump up
[03:57:09.760 --> 03:57:11.400]  to have the thing slam on them with their uniforms.
[03:57:11.400 --> 03:57:14.360]  Like, she starts off on a stool
[03:57:14.360 --> 03:57:15.680]  and they just give her enough injections
[03:57:15.680 --> 03:57:17.200]  or she can finally stand up.
[03:57:18.200 --> 03:57:19.920]  Take the pillows away, let's go.
[03:57:19.920 --> 03:57:21.840]  They just say Alex Jones a bunch of times
[03:57:21.840 --> 03:57:23.720]  and she gets so mad that she's able to finally
[03:57:23.720 --> 03:57:26.200]  have some energy and go on stage.
[03:57:26.200 --> 03:57:28.440]  You're right, web traffic is three times more than normal.
[03:57:28.440 --> 03:57:30.560]  But see, here's an example.
[03:57:30.560 --> 03:57:32.840]  What was it where it was like 15 times
[03:57:32.840 --> 03:57:34.600]  it's record or something?
[03:57:34.600 --> 03:57:37.320]  That's when there's like a mass shooting or a bombing.
[03:57:37.320 --> 03:57:38.800]  People tune in for us.
[03:57:38.800 --> 03:57:40.080]  That's why she's not even that big.
[03:57:40.080 --> 03:57:42.320]  People tune in to hear what we have to say about an event.
[03:57:42.320 --> 03:57:44.000]  Because they know what we're really trying to say.
[03:57:44.000 --> 03:57:47.120]  This is it, Alex Jones triggered Hillary Clinton.
[03:57:47.120 --> 03:57:49.320]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:57:49.320 --> 03:57:50.800]  Oh, you know, you get a thug life.
[03:57:50.800 --> 03:57:51.640]  Where's your thug life?
[03:57:51.640 --> 03:57:52.760]  You triggered her.
[03:57:52.760 --> 03:57:53.920]  Yeah, big said good.
[03:57:53.920 --> 03:57:55.720]  He triggered like an immigrant over.
[03:57:55.720 --> 03:57:56.840]  You triggered Hillary Clinton.
[03:57:56.840 --> 03:57:59.160]  I think that deserves the thug life category.
[03:57:59.160 --> 03:58:01.520]  Well, we can do a payday with this
[03:58:01.520 --> 03:58:02.720]  because we can show like,
[03:58:02.720 --> 03:58:05.160]  the news went Saudi Arabia involved, government stood down
[03:58:05.160 --> 03:58:08.640]  like ABC News and then cut to me like 10 years ago saying it.
[03:58:08.640 --> 03:58:10.640]  And they cut Hillary going, he says 9-11.
[03:58:10.640 --> 03:58:12.240]  And then, and then like experts say
[03:58:12.240 --> 03:58:13.240]  there were bombs inside the building
[03:58:13.240 --> 03:58:14.360]  Oklahoma City, they cut to me.
[03:58:14.360 --> 03:58:16.040]  He said Oklahoma triggered.
[03:58:16.040 --> 03:58:17.440]  And then it just goes down the line.
[03:58:17.440 --> 03:58:18.280]  All right, we're out of time.
[03:58:18.280 --> 03:58:19.120]  What difference does it make?
[03:58:19.120 --> 03:58:20.680]  Support us, purchase the products.
[03:58:20.680 --> 03:58:21.760]  We're independent media.
[03:58:21.760 --> 03:58:23.200]  We don't have globalist funding us.
[03:58:23.200 --> 03:58:24.600]  Just like Trump doesn't.
[03:58:24.600 --> 03:58:26.080]  The new Selenium is back in stock.
[03:58:26.080 --> 03:58:26.920]  It was great with the X2.
