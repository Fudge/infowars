[00:30.000 --> 00:37.200]  It's Sunday Live. I am your host, Alex Jones, a broadcasting worldwide from the
[00:37.200 --> 00:45.040]  Battled Info Wars News Centers in Austin, Texas. It is June 27th. The year is 2021.
[00:46.320 --> 00:50.080]  We have some really big guests today. We have Mike Lindell on the latest
[00:50.720 --> 00:55.680]  with all of the election fraud that's coming out. And I've seen the evidence. It's massive.
[00:55.680 --> 01:01.920]  He's going to be joining us in the second hour. The media attacks him because he is so optimistic.
[01:02.560 --> 01:06.080]  But if you're not optimistic when you have the truth, then they're going to be able to gaslight
[01:06.080 --> 01:12.480]  everybody that understanding what a fraud Joe Biden is. But even a lot of mainline leftists
[01:12.480 --> 01:17.280]  that I personally know are starting to panic. Joe Rogan's gone from being a Democrat basically
[01:17.280 --> 01:22.560]  now being a nationalist, populist, Republican. It's awakened him. You've got Bill Maher coming
[01:22.560 --> 01:30.640]  out and saying Google and Big Tech are invested in the COVID lie and they're involved in the cover
[01:30.640 --> 01:36.080]  up and they shouldn't be doing that. It's criminal. And so again, the wheels are really,
[01:36.080 --> 01:40.800]  really starting to come off. Also, we told you here a month ago because Roger Stone used to
[01:40.800 --> 01:46.400]  live in New York, but he just sold his apartment there last year because they've been bankrupting
[01:46.400 --> 01:51.360]  him with all these criminal charges and the rest of it. And he has Democrat sources in the city.
[01:51.360 --> 01:58.240]  And they said, we're intending to indict Trump, at least members of his family, by July 4th.
[01:58.240 --> 02:03.280]  That was a month ago. Now CNN is reporting. And the Democrats are saying that they're planning
[02:03.280 --> 02:11.040]  to indict his company, which is unheard of, before July 4th. And Rogers talks to the people.
[02:11.040 --> 02:18.000]  They say it's happening. It's just insane. I mean, the government spent 40-something million
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  dollars trying to find something the feds did. They couldn't find it. But Rogers got the inside
[02:22.000 --> 02:30.880]  scoop. He's going to be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour. And then Lindell is on
[02:32.720 --> 02:38.560]  in the second hour. I want to show TV viewers a couple of things here that really say it all.
[02:38.560 --> 02:43.200]  One of the producers gave me this and it touched my heart because it's so true. Many are the plans
[02:43.200 --> 02:49.520]  in a man's heart. But it is the Lord's purpose that prevails, Proverbs 19, 21. And then this
[02:49.520 --> 02:55.520]  really funny little piece that a friend sent me that I guess is from Twitter. And you really
[02:55.520 --> 02:58.400]  should go there. And I guess find the HD version. We can put it on the screen. But there it is.
[02:59.120 --> 03:04.960]  And it's a wolf. It's a wolf, if you're a regular, I'll narrate it. It's a wolf in the woods,
[03:04.960 --> 03:11.600]  in the frozen landscape. And he says, humans at a campfire, it's cold and I'm starving. Maybe I
[03:11.600 --> 03:18.640]  should ask for some scraps. What's the worst thing that could happen? 10,000 years later,
[03:19.360 --> 03:27.360]  you've got a very cute pug wearing a birthday cake hat on top of its head, completely domesticated,
[03:27.360 --> 03:34.000]  totally and absolutely enslaved by the nanny state, a shadow of its former self. And I really think
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.960]  Arctopoli, I'm going to reverse engineer this or make our own t-shirt version of this,
[03:38.960 --> 03:45.520]  this meme shirt, because this really says everything. Humanity's choice, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:46.400 --> 03:52.160]  That is where we are right now. This is really, this is really humanity's choice.
[03:52.880 --> 03:56.800]  And this whole velvet octopus that is the New World Order is a sucking
[03:58.640 --> 04:02.800]  all of our energy, all of our will, all of our male and female energy.
[04:02.800 --> 04:08.400]  And not trying to domesticate us, we can be a lapdog, domesticating us, we can be phased out from the
[04:08.400 --> 04:14.000]  face of the earth. I've read a lot of huge articles dealing with that. We're going to be laying out
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.200]  here today, right away when we come back, because we have two big guests. I need to hit a lot in
[04:19.200 --> 04:24.640]  the first 30 minutes or so. We have the Leningardian and others saying it's time to empty out half the
[04:24.640 --> 04:30.960]  earth's population. You have all these declarations of transhumanist war on the family. They're now
[04:30.960 --> 04:37.600]  out in the open. It is all coming up on this live Sunday show. Oh, and the big headline for the live
[04:37.600 --> 04:46.960]  show that I have on enforce.com is CDC admits COVID-19 vaccine does not work. They're now saying,
[04:46.960 --> 04:52.080]  so's the UN, put your mask back on, permanent lockdown forever, because it's all about
[04:52.080 --> 04:56.960]  bankrupting us and taking control of us. You could never make a vaccine for the common cold.
[04:56.960 --> 05:06.240]  It's all a criminal fraud. The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has
[05:06.240 --> 05:15.120]  to have its revolution. We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the
[05:15.120 --> 05:22.160]  entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled
[05:22.160 --> 05:29.360]  slaves. Orson slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system,
[05:30.400 --> 05:37.040]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic
[05:37.040 --> 05:42.800]  control. We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare
[05:42.800 --> 05:47.280]  dystopia, and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[05:47.280 --> 05:53.520]  It's that choice. It's that realization that's going to change the world, and it's the only choice
[05:53.520 --> 05:58.880]  we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil. It is a spiritual battle, an info wars at the tip
[05:58.880 --> 06:10.320]  of the spear fighting it. Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop
[06:10.320 --> 06:18.240]  tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:29.760 --> 06:36.400]  Welcome, my friends. Welcome to this live, June 27th, Sunday broadcast. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:36.400 --> 06:42.320]  We've got big breaking news on the looming attempts to indict President Trump and his family. We
[06:42.320 --> 06:48.960]  told you about a month ago that they were planning to launch in New York City by July 4th. Now,
[06:48.960 --> 06:55.280]  CNN says the plan is to have the Trump Organization indicted, very rare operation,
[06:55.280 --> 07:01.520]  by July 4th. We have sources inside the enemy camp. Roger Stone will be joining us at the bottom
[07:01.520 --> 07:07.680]  of the hour. And then Mike Lindell to help break down the massive evidence of fraud pouring out
[07:07.680 --> 07:12.800]  of the Arizona audit. And so much more, President Trump more and more saying he can be reinstated,
[07:12.800 --> 07:17.760]  saying that Biden's an impostor. You've got Al Gore and you've got Mitt Romney and all of them on
[07:17.760 --> 07:25.040]  TV scared, saying it's white supremism. What does that have to do with the election being stolen?
[07:25.040 --> 07:30.240]  If we go find evidence of it, just throwing that out there, they are really getting desperate. So
[07:30.240 --> 07:36.000]  that's coming up on this live Sunday edition. And O. M. Schreuer comes in with the new Sunday
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.360]  live show. It's very popular. We've been doing now for about six months. It's crazy how time flies.
[07:41.360 --> 07:46.560]  And that is 6 to 8 p.m. Central right after this transmission. Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[07:46.560 --> 07:53.600]  But let's get this first right now. The wheels have completely come off the COVID-19 fraud.
[07:54.400 --> 07:57.920]  Why did they never have a vaccine for just the basic common cold?
[07:57.920 --> 08:02.720]  The coronavirus is the main cause of the common cold. If you're debilitated on the right
[08:02.720 --> 08:06.560]  methamphetamids minerals, it will go in, it will replicate, and you will get sick.
[08:07.600 --> 08:14.640]  That's known science. Well, because there's too many variants of it. There's hundreds of thousands
[08:14.640 --> 08:18.800]  a year. There's millions. I mean, they're always finding more and more and more. There's like fish
[08:18.800 --> 08:24.800]  in the sea, sand at the beach, leaves on trees in the forest. There's a lot. And it's our body's
[08:24.800 --> 08:32.800]  defenses that defeat that 99.999% of time, not taking a vaccine that is specifically for one
[08:32.800 --> 08:37.760]  variant when viruses are constantly changing and their own medical science admits when you
[08:37.760 --> 08:43.600]  take a vaccine like this, it causes your body to slough off things that basically are other
[08:43.600 --> 08:48.240]  variants of the virus. That's even Wall Street Journal. That's the discoverer of HIV saying
[08:48.240 --> 08:54.480]  that. Saying this is insane. Don't take it. So the mainline science is set all along armies of top
[08:54.480 --> 09:00.000]  scientists, armies of Nobel Prize winners and heads of universities and heads of hospitals and
[09:00.000 --> 09:06.000]  heads of research firms and chief scientist at Pfizer who just retired three years ago saying
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.120]  this is going to cause blood clots and heart attacks. And it did because they've already
[09:11.120 --> 09:15.600]  done studies on similar vaccines. Well, here it is out of the VAERS reporting system,
[09:15.600 --> 09:21.360]  reported deaths, COVID vaccines, more than the last 10 years combined. And I think about one in
[09:21.360 --> 09:26.720]  40 is the real number, not one in 10, not one in 100, about one in 40 of these things get put
[09:26.720 --> 09:35.520]  down as COVID. So it's 40 times worse than that, 40 times 5,888 dead. Oh, and now the FDA adds
[09:35.520 --> 09:39.840]  warning to COVID vaccine about risk of heart inflammation, no longer just saying, oh, it's
[09:39.840 --> 09:47.040]  rare. It's very common. And estimates are now out that you're 500 times more likely to die from a
[09:47.040 --> 09:53.120]  COVID vaccine than from COVID. If you are young, for whatever reason, and we're gonna be breaking
[09:53.120 --> 10:00.400]  some of that down coming up as well. Here's another headline. Who urges fully vaccinated people to
[10:00.400 --> 10:06.880]  continue to wear masks as Delta COVID variant spreads? Oh, a variant of the cold virus. My
[10:06.880 --> 10:13.120]  goodness, we can't ever leave our houses again. People better wake up now, folks, BBC. Andrew
[10:13.120 --> 10:17.920]  Mars says he caught COVID after getting the vaccine. A lot of folks dying. They said dying
[10:17.920 --> 10:23.680]  of COVID or dying from the vaccine. That's BBC and RT. Some fully vaccinated people may get sick
[10:23.680 --> 10:30.000]  of exposed to variants CDC says CNN COVID-19 killed 26 Indonesian doctors in June after
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.360]  they've been vaccinated. 10 had taken China's Sinovac vaccine. And it goes on and on and on.
[10:35.360 --> 10:44.400]  4,115 vaccinated people have died than hospitalized with COVID-19 breakthrough infections. Again,
[10:44.400 --> 10:48.960]  it goes through all of it right here. And I've got so much more just in this stack. But the first
[10:48.960 --> 10:54.400]  thing I want to hit is Bill Maher finally waking up that his audience isn't buying his bull, or
[10:54.400 --> 11:04.480]  maybe he said the road to Damascus awakening that Paul did, but he's totally absolutely getting it
[11:04.480 --> 11:14.000]  now. And saying, wait a minute. We've got Google and Facebook invested at the Wuhan lab. We've
[11:14.000 --> 11:21.040]  got them invested billions in these vaccines. And then they're involved covering up. That's
[11:21.040 --> 11:25.680]  criminal. That's right. I mean, how did I tell you last year, Google and Facebook are all involved?
[11:25.680 --> 11:32.960]  I went and looked it up. They're obsessed with depopulation. It's their cult. So they paid to
[11:32.960 --> 11:38.640]  have the viruses found in the wild. They paid to have them spliced Facebook and Google. Facebook
[11:38.640 --> 11:44.240]  and Google aren't just big tech companies. They are the tip of the new world order attack system.
[11:44.240 --> 11:49.600]  They surveil you, they watch you, they listen to you, they censor you, they control you,
[11:49.600 --> 11:54.560]  and they report you to your bank and you lose your bank account, give you question the election.
[11:54.560 --> 12:03.040]  They are the intimidators. They are the bullies. They are the trillion pound gorilla on our back.
[12:03.040 --> 12:07.760]  And they are bringing in the new dark age. They're monsters and they know they're monsters.
[12:07.760 --> 12:13.200]  They're not liberal, well-meaning idiots that just go too far. They are the brainwashers.
[12:13.200 --> 12:17.520]  They are the controllers. Now on the children's games and children's articles and everything on
[12:17.520 --> 12:21.680]  Facebook, to be allowed to be on Facebook, all teaching material that came out is going to have
[12:21.680 --> 12:27.840]  to use gender neutral pronouns and all this. This is an assault on humanity itself, on our
[12:27.840 --> 12:31.840]  very biology for depopulation. And in the light papers out of Tabistock Institute,
[12:32.640 --> 12:36.480]  I've got articles on it today. They admit, oh, we're doing this to depopulate the earth.
[12:37.440 --> 12:41.120]  That's why we're sterilizing all the autistic and mentally retarded children. We don't want
[12:41.120 --> 12:45.280]  them having kids. So we teach them to be transgender. We make it a celebration of having
[12:45.280 --> 12:49.760]  their genitals removed. So first they brain damage you with the vaccines, then they cut your testicles
[12:49.760 --> 12:55.040]  off and they admit they're doing it. Is this something all of you really want to sign on to
[12:55.040 --> 13:00.240]  this madness, this evil, which is only going to get worse? Once you sign on to the eugenics and
[13:00.240 --> 13:05.360]  the depopulation and the transhumanism that were bombarded with everywhere three weeks ago, the
[13:05.360 --> 13:09.280]  Senate wouldn't even outlaw human animal cloning that they admitted was, well, it's been going on
[13:09.280 --> 13:16.240]  for 30 years in the U.S. And so we're not going to ban it. See? You're like, how did you know that?
[13:16.240 --> 13:22.320]  It's in all the medical literature. They're not supposed to grow the clones up with brains,
[13:22.320 --> 13:26.960]  but they do because the clones don't operate enough if they don't have brains. So they have
[13:26.960 --> 13:31.040]  accelerated aging. They don't even know what they are. They're basically kept in these facilities.
[13:31.040 --> 13:34.800]  And it's all going to come out, folks. That's why they're desperately got all these new shows on
[13:34.800 --> 13:40.320]  TV about the clones and about the human animal hybrids like sweet tooth and sexy beasts.
[13:40.880 --> 13:45.120]  They're just desperately trying to acclimate you before it all comes out because they can't
[13:45.120 --> 13:50.800]  even hide it anymore. You're going to wake up and find out they've created alien species
[13:50.800 --> 13:58.240]  by the thousands on earth, intestines, new species that never existed. Salmon is now on store shelves
[13:58.240 --> 14:04.640]  that has walking stick and asparagus genes in it. The Pfizer shot has the entire genome
[14:04.640 --> 14:12.720]  of a jellyfish hive colony creature. You know why, right? They've already announced that if you
[14:12.720 --> 14:20.480]  have contact with a certain type of tech from Texas, the Lone Star Tech, it's actually all
[14:20.480 --> 14:26.000]  across the country, and that if you have had access to a certain type of jellyfish things
[14:26.560 --> 14:32.400]  that you develop an allergy to meat and it's the same jellyfish that they put in you
[14:32.400 --> 14:41.120]  with a human genome, they combine the jellyfish colony creature genome with a boy who died in
[14:41.120 --> 14:46.560]  the 60s. It's in the patent. They say it's secret why they did it, but they spliced a human with
[14:46.560 --> 14:50.400]  a jellyfish, then they injected it and you saw the professor on TV last week took her
[14:50.400 --> 14:54.160]  awesome plate, they had bioethicants in the U.S. He said, we're going to inject you so that you
[14:54.160 --> 14:58.480]  never eat meat again, beef again. So it's not just you're going to be sterile, it's not just
[14:58.480 --> 15:02.720]  you're going to have children, you're not going to be able to eat beef anymore. They're hitting you
[15:02.720 --> 15:07.280]  and hitting you hard. They're like kamikazes. You go, well, they're all going to go to prison,
[15:07.280 --> 15:12.160]  they're all going to get in trouble. They don't care. They're psychos. It's a control cult.
[15:12.160 --> 15:15.040]  It's their excuse to play God and take over to save the earth.
[15:18.080 --> 15:21.600]  We know what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to say it again.
[15:22.560 --> 15:29.840]  Salmons sold in stores across the U.S. unlabeled. Joe Biden removes a order on that
[15:29.840 --> 15:36.320]  so you can now eat a fish that's part of the insect. And you're like, well, that's not too
[15:36.320 --> 15:39.680]  bad. They tell me I'm going to eat bugs all over TV. See, it's just acclimate you. Oh, you're
[15:39.680 --> 15:42.560]  going to have sex with animals. You're going to have sex with children. You're going to eat bugs.
[15:42.560 --> 15:48.080]  It's all just to shock you, disorient you, so you accept all of this. We're going to come back
[15:48.080 --> 15:52.000]  and we'll play the Bill Maher piece, another powerful Greg Reese piece, and then Roger Stone
[15:52.000 --> 15:58.000]  with Exclusive Intel straight ahead. I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video.
[16:00.880 --> 16:05.840]  Infowars is here because there's a war on for your mind. That's why I spent our motto for more
[16:05.840 --> 16:12.080]  than 25 years. And if you research even the UN's own admissions, over 2 billion people on planet
[16:12.080 --> 16:18.480]  earth out of 7.5 billion have cognitive disabilities lower IQ because of lack of iodine. That's why
[16:18.480 --> 16:23.440]  they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food, isn't in the salt anymore. Now, regular iodine
[16:23.440 --> 16:29.600]  that you find in food is bound to different minerals. And so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[16:29.600 --> 16:33.520]  But if you get the proper type of iodine, there's three types that are good for the body.
[16:33.520 --> 16:38.800]  It does amazing things. It's essential in the body. But we have our amazing tri-iodine,
[16:38.800 --> 16:44.160]  a big shipment came in, and we're able to offer it at the lowest price ever, 60% off. That is
[16:44.160 --> 16:51.360]  survival shield X3, 60% off with three types of powerful iodine. Tri-iodine is from a patented
[16:51.360 --> 16:56.080]  process that stabilizes the iodine and makes even more powerful the cellular level. You and your
[16:56.080 --> 16:59.840]  family will love it. It's incredible for your body. Get it infowars.com today.
[16:59.840 --> 17:04.400]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health. It has
[17:04.400 --> 17:09.280]  been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight
[17:09.280 --> 17:15.520]  gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system. Introducing

[19:53.120 --> 20:07.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:07.280 --> 20:28.640]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. I'm live. I'm Alex Jones. Then we return Sunday
[20:28.640 --> 20:35.520]  nights, 4 to 6 p.m. Central, and of course, Owen Schreuer, that also hosts the War Room,
[20:35.520 --> 20:40.320]  3 to 6 p.m. weekdays. He also hosts two hours on Sunday night right when this transmission ends.
[20:40.320 --> 20:43.200]  And of course, there's other great broadcasts like Harrison Smith, 8 a.m.
[20:44.000 --> 20:47.680]  weekday mornings with American Journal. So many great guests, so many great callers,
[20:47.680 --> 20:54.560]  and it is an amazing analysis. All right. So let's get back into the COVID situation.
[20:54.560 --> 20:59.200]  Real science shows that they cooked it in the lab. Real science shows they did that
[20:59.200 --> 21:04.000]  so they'd have a newcomer virus they could corporately own and produce vaccines off of
[21:04.000 --> 21:07.920]  that companies tied to Fauci and Gates would make hundreds of billions of dollars off of.
[21:07.920 --> 21:13.120]  And now it came out in government documents last week. And major U.S. universities had
[21:13.120 --> 21:17.680]  had copies of this that the federal government that Fauci had destroyed last year.
[21:18.800 --> 21:26.160]  Ryder and Trump's knows that they were a month before COVID was even announced preparing COVID-19
[21:26.160 --> 21:30.880]  vaccines at Wuhan and that they were developing vaccines for COVID-19 there that they then
[21:30.880 --> 21:37.680]  released themselves. Remember, Peter Dazik said in 2019 in an interview that they were
[21:37.680 --> 21:42.400]  developing vaccines off of combining five viruses from bats in the COVID family.
[21:43.360 --> 21:46.000]  That was always hiding in plain view. We were the first to hammer that.
[21:46.560 --> 21:50.080]  And Tucker covered it as well. But I mean, again, I can talk for hours about this.
[21:51.200 --> 21:56.800]  We have every damn facet of it. How they cooked it up, why they did it, the lockdown,
[21:56.800 --> 22:01.120]  the control, the carbon taxes, the shutting down their competition, the rolling out the
[22:01.120 --> 22:05.440]  vaccines that they own themselves because when they could isolate it, already know it was about
[22:05.440 --> 22:11.920]  to be released, they could then tell Pfizer, Moderna and others what they were supposed to
[22:12.480 --> 22:16.080]  create and respond to. They told them, oh, don't do like China's doing,
[22:16.080 --> 22:20.880]  making wonders of an attenuated COVID virus. No, no, no, that's a virus I can't replicate.
[22:21.440 --> 22:25.360]  We want you to create something for the spike protein around the virus.
[22:25.360 --> 22:28.960]  So all the other makers around the world, because they're getting globalist money from Gates and
[22:28.960 --> 22:36.080]  others, they came out with one, not for the sequence of the RNA, but for the shell of the
[22:36.080 --> 22:43.040]  virus, which again, is all over the damn body. So your body attacks itself. It kills you in a
[22:43.040 --> 22:48.480]  thousand different ways. And this is, you understand, this is not debatable. They have committed giant
[22:48.480 --> 22:54.080]  crimes against humanity on a scale of Hitler, Stalin and Mao. I mean, you are living to just
[22:54.080 --> 22:58.960]  see insaneness, but they're depopulationists. They said, we've only got a few years to save
[22:58.960 --> 23:04.080]  the earth. We got to depopulate now. It's their excuse towards mass murder and control while they
[23:04.080 --> 23:11.040]  get rich in the process. So Bill Maher is starting to understand this and going, wait, big tech
[23:11.600 --> 23:15.040]  are involved in this and they're the ones covering it up.
[23:15.600 --> 23:18.640]  He's, they're the very ones we want to investigate. Here's Bill Maher.
[23:19.840 --> 23:23.520]  All right. Let me ask you about the media aspect of this because I find this outrageous.
[23:23.520 --> 23:31.920]  Facebook banned any post for four months about COVID coming from a lab. Of course,
[23:31.920 --> 23:37.200]  now even the Biden administration is looking into this. Google, a Wall Street Journal reporter,
[23:37.200 --> 23:43.040]  asked the head of Google's health division, notice that they don't do autofill searches
[23:43.040 --> 23:48.400]  for coronavirus lab leak, the way they do it for any other question. And the guy said, well,
[23:48.400 --> 23:54.160]  we want to make sure the search isn't leading people down pathways that we would find to be
[23:54.160 --> 24:01.920]  not authoritative information. Well, you were wrong, Google and Facebook. We don't know. The
[24:01.920 --> 24:07.440]  reason why we want you is because we're checking on this. He said, we want to ensure the first thing
[24:07.440 --> 24:14.000]  users see is information from the CDC, the who, that's who I'm checking on. The who has been
[24:14.000 --> 24:20.000]  very corrupt about a lot. And the CDC has been wrong about a lot of this is outrageous that
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.480]  I can't look this information up. And now they're doing it with this drug, ivermectin.
[24:24.480 --> 24:30.160]  They threw Brett Weinstein off YouTube or almost. He's one strike away. YouTube should
[24:30.160 --> 24:35.520]  not be telling me what I can see about ivermectin. Ivermectin isn't a registered Republican.
[24:35.520 --> 24:41.200]  It's a drug. I don't know if it works or not. And a lot of other doctors don't either.
[24:41.200 --> 24:48.800]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, this is a big deal. Of course, Marr doesn't know or
[24:48.800 --> 24:53.200]  he's covering up, but he probably just doesn't know that they're blocking ivermectin and they're
[24:53.200 --> 24:58.080]  blocking all these other cures because then you can't have an emergency authorization vaccine.
[24:58.080 --> 25:03.600]  It was a treatment that even has 5% efficacy. These others have like 98, 99% if you get to
[25:03.600 --> 25:08.480]  somebody on time with any viral infection. So think about how cold blooded and evil this is.
[25:08.480 --> 25:13.040]  They're blocking real treatments from the public. And when they go and sit with a cold or the flu,
[25:13.040 --> 25:16.720]  not even COVID, they won't give them these other treatments doctors have always used
[25:16.720 --> 25:20.480]  for decades because the UN says they can't now. That's total enslavement.
[25:20.480 --> 25:24.880]  Here's Greg Reese's latest powerful report, smoking-unproof COVID pandemic is a scam.
[25:24.880 --> 25:39.520]  According to the official narrative, COVID-19 was first discovered as a pneumonia outbreak
[25:39.520 --> 25:48.640]  in the city of Wuhan on December 31st of 2019. And it wasn't until January 9th of 2020 when this
[25:48.640 --> 25:55.680]  supposed mystery virus was officially diagnosed as a novel coronavirus. Operation Warp Speed
[25:55.680 --> 26:02.960]  began on May 15th of 2020 to facilitate and accelerate the development of COVID-19 vaccines.
[26:02.960 --> 26:09.760]  Of the companies receiving research funding, the one responsible for the mRNA vaccine was Moderna.
[26:11.360 --> 26:13.680]  But we know that none of this checks out.
[26:13.680 --> 26:22.000]  We now know that Anthony Fauci used NIH funds to create a novel coronavirus capable of directly
[26:22.000 --> 26:28.640]  infecting humans. And we also know that Moderna has been working with Fauci's NIH
[26:28.640 --> 26:39.440]  on the mRNA COVID vaccine since December of 2019. Born in 2010 as Mode RNA Therapeutics,
[26:39.440 --> 26:47.360]  they were criticized for their radical specialty of mRNA biohacking that transforms human cells
[26:47.360 --> 26:56.960]  into drug factories and later changed their name to Moderna. With a reputation for losing top talent
[26:56.960 --> 27:03.760]  and keeping investors in the dark due to dangerous, unpredictable side effects, Moderna somehow became
[27:03.760 --> 27:13.760]  Big Pharma's golden unicorn. They went public in December of 2018 with the largest ever IPO in the
[27:13.760 --> 27:21.040]  biotech industry. Without even having a safe, effective product, they blew up faster than Uber.
[27:22.160 --> 27:28.640]  And a year later, before COVID-19 ever made headlines, Moderna was working with Fauci's
[27:28.640 --> 27:35.680]  NIH outsourcing redacted challenge studies where subjects are deliberately infected
[27:35.680 --> 27:43.200]  with the Fauci funded Wuhan lab made coronavirus and treated with Moderna's experimental gene therapy.
[27:45.280 --> 27:49.520]  And as fate would have it, the massive investment in Moderna paid off.
[27:50.400 --> 27:56.640]  Operation Warp Speed brought Moderna's COVID-19 payoff to just under $2.5 billion
[27:56.640 --> 28:04.880]  dollars. And actual sales to the U.S. alone is already over $15 billion. There does not seem
[28:04.880 --> 28:11.280]  to be any breakthrough science. The mRNA shots are still proving to be as unpredictable and
[28:11.280 --> 28:18.720]  deadly as experts have been saying for years. And we now officially know that the shot is
[28:18.720 --> 28:25.360]  permanently changing the person's DNA. And yet people are still lining up to get the shot.
[28:25.360 --> 28:33.840]  Thanks to media and Big Pharma, and thanks to the self-proclaimed philanthropists who fund the media
[28:33.840 --> 28:42.080]  and Big Pharma, the ones who call themselves the Good Club, the ones who met in 2009 to discuss
[28:42.080 --> 28:49.600]  how to save the world and how overpopulation was a major priority. How much more evidence
[28:49.600 --> 28:54.960]  do we need before we collectively realize that this entire thing is a scam?
[28:56.400 --> 28:58.720]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[29:01.920 --> 29:06.640]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[29:07.440 --> 29:15.520]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological
[29:15.520 --> 29:23.680]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[29:24.720 --> 29:28.400]  Worse than slaves. Just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[29:29.520 --> 29:36.080]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic
[29:36.080 --> 29:41.840]  control. We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world that realizes a nightmare
[29:41.840 --> 29:46.320]  dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[29:46.960 --> 29:50.080]  It's that choice. It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[29:51.120 --> 29:56.880]  And it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil. It is a spiritual battle,
[29:56.880 --> 29:58.800]  and Infowars is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[30:00.960 --> 30:06.800]  The equation is very simple. The mega banks control the media, they control Big Pharma,
[30:06.800 --> 30:13.440]  they control academia, they control the military, industrial complex, they control Big Tech,
[30:14.480 --> 30:20.080]  and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they have established absolute
[30:20.080 --> 30:27.280]  total despotism and dehumanization. It is the western Christian idea of human freedom that
[30:27.280 --> 30:32.080]  ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[30:32.080 --> 30:38.240]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down,
[30:38.240 --> 30:45.760]  and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens
[30:45.760 --> 30:51.280]  their monopolies of control. That's why they target Infowars because we understand the keys
[30:51.280 --> 30:56.720]  to defeating them. But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote Infowars and ban that
[30:56.720 --> 31:03.120]  video. So redouble your efforts, we're all in this together. The BioProse are the new non-GMO

[32:59.760 --> 33:11.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:30.080 --> 33:39.920]  We're seeing a lot of really crazy things happening. We're seeing a lot of tyranny.
[33:40.800 --> 33:46.720]  We're seeing evil in high places trying to have its will with us and dominate us.
[33:49.600 --> 33:54.000]  We are seeing the globalists make their move in a big, big way.
[33:54.000 --> 34:04.880]  But here's Proverbs 19, 21. Many are the plans in a man's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose
[34:05.840 --> 34:11.840]  that prevails. And I've seen that over and over again. My dad always tells me that when I was a
[34:11.840 --> 34:18.320]  child and even now when I get upset about things, he says, son, the best laid plans of mice and
[34:18.320 --> 34:24.480]  men often go astray. And all these different globalist programs I've seen may work in their
[34:24.480 --> 34:31.040]  first and second step, but it always has uncontrollable developments that they can't foresee.
[34:31.040 --> 34:35.600]  We're about to be talking to Roger Stone, Mike Lindell's coming up later in the next hour with
[34:35.600 --> 34:41.520]  big news. Talk about tomorrow's news today. We're not happy about this news. It was Roger a month ago
[34:42.640 --> 34:46.160]  that said his sources in New York said they are intending to indict Trump by July 4th.
[34:46.160 --> 34:51.680]  Well, CNN announced it and rubbing their hands together that they think indictment of his company
[34:51.680 --> 34:56.480]  by July 4th, an unprecedented move. Talk about straw man. We'll break it down
[34:58.000 --> 35:04.960]  in a moment and why they're panicking so much. But first, let's talk about reality here.
[35:05.840 --> 35:12.720]  Two things. You need to support the economy and support organizations that tell the truth
[35:12.720 --> 35:17.600]  and fight tyranny. And there's no organization out there that's done a better job overall than
[35:17.600 --> 35:21.840]  this broadcast with our crew and all the guests and you, the listeners of this family. Then we
[35:21.840 --> 35:26.640]  need funds to operate and keep the situation on the air. And we're just right there between the red
[35:26.640 --> 35:32.320]  and the black. And I want to be able to expand, not contract. So please shop at infowarstore.com
[35:32.320 --> 35:37.680]  today. It's a first rate site with thousands of great items. We have the once a year, July 4th
[35:37.680 --> 35:42.800]  super sale going right now, which means free shipping and double page reappoints are back.
[35:43.360 --> 35:48.480]  Survival Shield X2 sold out 50% off. The good halogen. Find out about it. Find out about
[35:48.480 --> 35:54.080]  the iodine conspiracy. Super metal superfimilatality. Just good cold pressed herbs for libido, mainly.
[35:54.080 --> 35:58.080]  Everybody loves it. Both formulas are almost the same. It works for men and women, but there's two
[35:58.080 --> 36:04.240]  different variants of it. That's 50% off. Survival Shield X3, the tri iodine, 50% off.
[36:04.240 --> 36:09.040]  Bio tricillinium, 50% off. Ultimate krill oil. Highest grade krill oil. Way better than even
[36:09.040 --> 36:14.960]  fish oil, many say. 40% off. We have really high quality fish oil as well. And all water
[36:14.960 --> 36:21.440]  filtration is 10% off. Electropure Breeze and Electropure Pro and all those systems are there.
[36:21.440 --> 36:26.400]  And then separately, I want to hit this. We're going to Roger. Zero hedge. The Fed faces the
[36:26.400 --> 36:32.240]  greatest risk in its history. An economic crisis accompanied by inflation. They've done all this
[36:32.240 --> 36:37.200]  by design. They've decided to bring us into this dystopia. They've got new lockdowns being
[36:37.200 --> 36:42.080]  announced and looming. This is the new order move. Here's another one. U.S. food banks warn
[36:42.080 --> 36:48.960]  soaring prices will affect distributors. I talked to big national suppliers. They say
[36:49.520 --> 36:54.960]  everybody's already gone up massively. And how the indexes are. By the fall,
[36:54.960 --> 36:59.440]  60 plus percent increases in most major food scuffs. We've seen doubling and tripling in many
[36:59.440 --> 37:05.920]  major commodities. Lumber. Things like that are triple. I mean, this is serious, serious
[37:05.920 --> 37:10.640]  situation. And I bring that up because it's done by design. Blackouts live in California.
[37:10.640 --> 37:14.800]  These electricity prices are absolutely exploding. Why did I tell you what happened under Biden?
[37:14.800 --> 37:19.600]  Because they go back to the old globalist policies of shutting down America and economic war.
[37:20.160 --> 37:24.080]  And you see everything I told you is happening because the enemy is known. Their playbook is
[37:24.080 --> 37:30.480]  known. So what else is in the big July 4th sale? They said, Alex, we got good news. We have bought
[37:30.480 --> 37:36.080]  so much food out in my patriot that we're not going to raise prices this year. Everybody else
[37:36.080 --> 37:41.280]  is doing it again. And we're going to give you this month the authorization and right before
[37:41.280 --> 37:46.960]  Christmas to do 10% off. But then in the new year, we got to go up quite a bit. And that's the plan
[37:46.960 --> 37:52.560]  and that's what they are doing. So that's the other big part of the July 4th mega sale at
[37:52.560 --> 37:57.120]  infowarstore.com, the full My Patriot catalog. They have the lowest prices, an additional
[37:57.120 --> 38:04.560]  10% off at infowarstore.com. And they told me that I can run it when I said this month for three
[38:04.560 --> 38:11.520]  weeks. Three weeks, 10% off. It's storable food. It's high quality. It's what I use. You can give
[38:11.520 --> 38:17.760]  it to your friends and family. It is insurance you will eat. And it's the only way to inflation
[38:17.760 --> 38:22.160]  is to get things like storable food so that you basically freeze the price and then going forward
[38:22.160 --> 38:26.160]  it can supplement what you're doing. So very smart move with the attempts to break down the
[38:26.160 --> 38:34.080]  shutdown society and it funds info wars. So infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com. Okay.
[38:34.720 --> 38:40.800]  That said, now we've got our big guest here, ladies and gentlemen. And that's Roger Stone.
[38:41.920 --> 38:48.800]  And before I go to him, I want to just play a compilation of clips here. This is CNN rubbing
[38:48.800 --> 38:55.360]  their hands together about the looming indictment of Trump's company. That's just the beginning.
[38:55.360 --> 39:00.000]  And then Al Gore trying to say, oh, it's ridiculous to question the election.
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  It's preposterous. They're really scared about what's coming out of Arizona. Here it is.
[39:05.760 --> 39:09.280]  Breaking news. A major development in the Manhattan district attorney's investigation
[39:09.280 --> 39:13.520]  into the Trump organization, the DA office, telling Donald Trump's attorneys that criminal
[39:13.520 --> 39:18.560]  charges could be filed against Trump organization as soon as next week. The charges are believed
[39:18.560 --> 39:23.200]  to be tied to allegations of tax evasion over compensation paid to top executives.
[39:24.640 --> 39:34.320]  And you know, Pamela, the refusal of the former president to acknowledge that he lost by seven
[39:34.320 --> 39:39.840]  million votes, it wasn't close for God's sake. And apparently a majority of his party is still so
[39:39.840 --> 39:47.600]  enthralled to him that they still believe that the American people did not make the judgment that
[39:47.600 --> 39:52.400]  they clearly made. And Mitt Romney came out and made the same desperate statement, saying, oh,
[39:52.400 --> 39:57.440]  you know, he lost by seven million votes. Yeah, after the polls closed, he was winning my record
[39:57.440 --> 40:02.640]  amounts before that. So joining us is Roger Stone. Here's the headline. Roger Stone predicts
[40:02.640 --> 40:08.320]  a Donald Trump criminal indictment is on the horizon on my show. That was May 30th a month ago.
[40:09.040 --> 40:13.680]  Here's another one. A Trump longtime ally, Roger Stone says, former president must prepare to be
[40:13.680 --> 40:17.120]  indicted. Again, that's a month ago. And here's the new headline. Trump organization can face
[40:17.120 --> 40:24.160]  criminal charges in New York as soon as next week. Again, unprecedented. He's got sources up there.
[40:24.160 --> 40:28.240]  We hope this doesn't happen, but they are telegraphing. It's going to happen. Is this because
[40:28.240 --> 40:33.200]  they're so scared of Trump leading the Republican Party and going out and challenging their attempt
[40:33.200 --> 40:40.080]  to federalize elections? Alex, that's that's exactly what it is. Now, every one of those stories,
[40:40.080 --> 40:45.520]  of course, you have to go to the fifth paragraph before I'm quoted as saying these are fabricated
[40:45.520 --> 40:51.040]  charges that these are contrived politically motivated charges. I don't believe that the
[40:51.040 --> 40:57.200]  president or his real estate company did anything wrong. This is some kind of a case of selective
[40:57.200 --> 41:03.440]  prosecution. And it is being used because they are deathly afraid that Donald Trump will be on
[41:03.440 --> 41:10.080]  the ballot again in 2024. He surely beat them once. He most likely beat them twice. By the way,
[41:10.080 --> 41:15.600]  did Al Gore criticize Hillary Clinton when she demanded recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan
[41:15.600 --> 41:20.160]  and Wisconsin and refused to concede that she had lost? I don't recall that happening. Do you?
[41:20.720 --> 41:27.200]  So this is this is pure politics. And I can tell you exactly what happened here. The
[41:27.200 --> 41:33.600]  Mueller investigation and the thugs working there simply took the fruits of their exhaustive
[41:33.600 --> 41:38.080]  examination in which they could not find criminal charges against Donald Trump. And they
[41:38.080 --> 41:44.240]  shipped them to Sy Vance in Manhattan. That's essentially what happened. And I do think
[41:44.880 --> 41:50.800]  that the president needs to be very wary of this. If I were him, I would not be confident
[41:50.800 --> 41:56.640]  about the lawyers who handled his impeachment. That fellow Bruce Caster was an embarrassment.
[41:56.640 --> 42:01.840]  What did he mean when he said Joe Biden won the election fair and square? No, no, Bruce. No, he did
[42:01.840 --> 42:06.560]  not. And that's not your client's position. So I think it's vitally important that the president
[42:06.560 --> 42:14.480]  select one attorney who is not Eric Hirshman, who is not a sip alone. These two guys sold him out
[42:14.480 --> 42:20.080]  repeatedly. That's the reason, by the way, the New York Times has a big reveal two days ago.
[42:20.080 --> 42:25.360]  Perhaps it was yesterday that Trump ordered the Justice Department to draw up the documents to
[42:25.360 --> 42:30.880]  enact the insurrection act. The question is not why he had them drawn up. The question is why
[42:30.880 --> 42:36.800]  he didn't sign them. I mean, the first duty of the president of the United States is to preserve
[42:36.800 --> 42:43.280]  order. Seattle, Portland. That was real insurrection. But we know Millie also tried to
[42:43.280 --> 42:46.800]  shout down folks who wanted to do it. Stay there. We have the forum. We come back.
[42:46.800 --> 42:50.880]  Roger Stone will lay this out. We're not happy they're trying to indict Trump's organization.
[42:50.880 --> 42:54.480]  We're warning him so he can get on a war footing ahead of what's happening.
[42:54.480 --> 42:57.600]  And then of course, Roger's been talking to the president as well. We'll be right back. Stay with
[42:57.600 --> 43:04.400]  us. I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast. Hell, I've been on
[43:04.400 --> 43:08.960]  there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that. But let me tell you, the New World
[43:08.960 --> 43:13.440]  orders breathe them down our neck. The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're

[47:06.160 --> 47:33.920]  It was a month ago that Roger Stone joined us on air and said from his sources in New York
[47:33.920 --> 47:39.440]  where he until recently had an apartment, he's fully evacuated like Trump has the Florida because
[47:39.440 --> 47:45.200]  the incredible persecution and tyranny, he said my sources say by July 4th they are planning to
[47:46.000 --> 47:50.800]  indict people around Trump or Trump or his organization. Now they're saying sources in the
[47:50.800 --> 47:56.800]  city say this is going to happen. They're going to indict his organization. Trump needs to know
[47:58.000 --> 48:03.200]  what lawyers sold him out in the impeachment, what lawyers didn't. And Roger Stone doesn't
[48:03.200 --> 48:08.240]  want to toot his horn, but I asked him, I said for historic reasons, you need to get it on record.
[48:08.240 --> 48:16.480]  He said fine, I will tell you what happened behind the scenes so that Trump can hopefully
[48:16.480 --> 48:22.000]  protect himself and what went on during the impeachment because the second impeachment,
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.320]  because that ties in to all of this now and the very same players that are sabotaging the true
[48:28.320 --> 48:33.040]  president of the United States. We need to be strong and in place to lead major Republican
[48:33.040 --> 48:37.760]  take backs of the House and Senate. And that's why they that's why they fear him so much. So
[48:37.760 --> 48:43.280]  Roger, it was you worked with the group to get the videos showing Democrats calling for violence
[48:43.280 --> 48:49.200]  that ended up one lawyer. You got to actually play it when the others didn't. It was you that
[48:49.200 --> 48:54.160]  actually worked behind the scenes. And as the reason they dropped it and didn't go into the full
[48:54.160 --> 48:59.440]  trial, you don't want the credit, but you need to get it to show why the enemy hates you so much.
[48:59.440 --> 49:04.640]  So give people the inside baseball so Trump knows what he's facing right now and protects himself
[49:04.640 --> 49:09.920]  this time. Well, actually, as President Trump, we made exactly the right decision. Listen,
[49:09.920 --> 49:16.640]  David Shone, who's appeared many times with Sean Hannity and who's formerly a liberal Democrat,
[49:16.640 --> 49:23.280]  but but truly one of the finest lawyers I've ever met. The only lawyer I've ever met who not only
[49:23.280 --> 49:29.760]  has enormous courage, but he understands the overlay of politics and the law and he understands that
[49:29.760 --> 49:34.560]  things that happen outside the courtroom have an impact on what happens inside the courtroom.
[49:34.560 --> 49:39.280]  In this case, things that happen outside the Senate chamber have an impact on what happens
[49:39.280 --> 49:44.560]  inside the Senate chamber. Now, I know that several of the president's lawyers told him that
[49:44.560 --> 49:50.640]  Shone did not want to address the Senate. That was a lie that Shone did did not want to be out front.
[49:50.640 --> 49:55.440]  That was a lie. If you go back and look at that, the single strongest argument for Donald Trump,
[49:56.000 --> 50:02.800]  a man who quickly dismissed the constitutionality of the impeachment because firstly, the law says
[50:02.800 --> 50:09.120]  that the that the Chief Justice shall preside, shall. I mean, just not an option. No mention of
[50:09.120 --> 50:14.480]  the senator from Vermont there. So you told me on the phone tell the listeners because here's the
[50:14.480 --> 50:21.760]  bottom line. The other lawyer said, oh, Biden won the election and everything went along with a sham
[50:21.760 --> 50:26.640]  illegal impeachment without the Chief Justice there. As you just said, he called the elephant in the
[50:26.640 --> 50:32.560]  room. I'm getting there, Alex. So the key point here is that the president's other attorneys were
[50:32.560 --> 50:38.880]  opposed to showing the extraordinarily dramatic and hard hitting video in which you see various
[50:38.880 --> 50:46.960]  Democrats such as Maxine Waters, Chuck Schumer, many others calling for violence, the violence we
[50:46.960 --> 50:53.120]  saw last summer in the Pacific Northwest and in the Midwest, as well as Philadelphia and D.C. So
[50:53.120 --> 50:58.960]  I really think that David Shone did an exemplary job for the president. That is, if I were making
[50:58.960 --> 51:04.880]  the decision, he is the man I would put in charge because he's a fighter. He's not worried about his
[51:04.880 --> 51:10.960]  next case. He's not worried about what the jury, in this case, thought about him. He wants to win
[51:10.960 --> 51:16.640]  for his client. Let's go back to the Insurrection Act because it's a perfect example. I know for
[51:16.640 --> 51:23.600]  an absolute fact that Cipollone and Eric Hirschman and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs talked the
[51:23.600 --> 51:28.720]  president out of signing what he should have signed. This is not because I'm in favor of violence.
[51:28.720 --> 51:34.320]  This is because it is the duty of the president of the United States to preserve order. And what
[51:34.320 --> 51:40.800]  was happening in Spokane and Seattle and Kenosha and Philadelphia and D.C. was an orchestrated,
[51:40.800 --> 51:46.480]  well-financed insurrection. It's absolutely clear. Somebody paid for those pallets of bricks.
[51:46.480 --> 51:51.120]  Somebody paid for the buses and the flatbeds. Somebody paid for the lawyers who were standing
[51:51.120 --> 51:56.560]  by to bail people out when they were arrested. The president had that authority. I think it was a
[51:56.560 --> 52:02.080]  test. Sadly, the timid souls around the president, I think... That's right. When that test was failed,
[52:02.080 --> 52:06.400]  they made the move to provocateur January 6th, which we'll cover in a moment, which we now know
[52:06.400 --> 52:11.840]  they were trying to set you and I and the president up. But incredible inside baseball, Roger, that
[52:11.840 --> 52:15.680]  literally you had to get with folks. I knew about this at the time, but I'm glad you're willing to
[52:15.680 --> 52:19.840]  tell it now. It's not about credit. And you had to go with a group, have the video produced,
[52:19.840 --> 52:24.960]  showing the damn clips to get one lawyer in there to show it because they were going full at Trump.
[52:24.960 --> 52:29.200]  No one was defending him. Both arms tied behind his back because they were making it about the
[52:29.200 --> 52:33.440]  law when they weren't even defending on the law instead of bringing in the politics of you're
[52:33.440 --> 52:37.360]  saying he called for violence. He didn't. Here's all the Democrats calling for violence and for
[52:37.360 --> 52:42.640]  killing the president. That was the ace of damn spades. They wouldn't play it. But thank God,
[52:42.640 --> 52:47.920]  you hail married and got one guy in there. So now ahead of them trying to indict his organization,
[52:47.920 --> 52:51.680]  we need Trump to go into war footing here and not listen to these other damn lawyers.
[52:52.400 --> 52:57.040]  But let's make it clear. Donald Trump was in favor of showing that video from the very beginning.
[52:57.040 --> 53:02.080]  He liked the idea and he liked the strategy. This has happened time and time again. The
[53:02.080 --> 53:09.200]  president has extraordinarily good instincts and he is a fighter. So the good news, of course,
[53:09.200 --> 53:13.920]  is you needed to have a vote as quickly as possible because the votes were not there
[53:13.920 --> 53:18.560]  to convict in the impeachment. And the longer it dragged out and the more the media pounded
[53:18.560 --> 53:24.000]  on Trump, the more slippage there would have been. So my hats off to David Shown. But more
[53:24.000 --> 53:29.120]  importantly, my hats off for Donald Trump, too, for inserting him in the process and letting him
[53:29.120 --> 53:35.120]  show that extraordinary video. Yes, people had to stay up all night that worked with me to make it.
[53:35.120 --> 53:42.320]  But let's move on here because you just hit a very good point. And that is, when the latest
[53:42.320 --> 53:48.560]  narrative on January 6th, which is the great recycle, one outlet said that the feds are now
[53:48.560 --> 53:55.040]  focused on the fact that I was the mastermind, categorically false, wasn't there, didn't know
[53:55.040 --> 54:01.440]  anything about it in advance, didn't have any involvement whatsoever. But I did reveal, and I
[54:01.440 --> 54:07.200]  was excoriated for it, that when I was in my hotel room at the Willard shortly after the president's
[54:07.200 --> 54:12.720]  speech, there was a call from the Secret Service offering to escort me to the head of the march
[54:12.720 --> 54:20.480]  and up to the Capitol, which I declined. By the way, two pastors, two Reverend Protestant ministers
[54:20.480 --> 54:26.240]  and a police officer overheard all of that. Those are called witnesses. So for those who say, oh,
[54:26.240 --> 54:30.720]  that's a that's made up. No, it's not made up. It's a fact. It's not a conspiracy. And you were
[54:30.720 --> 54:35.840]  smart. You left early and got out of there. You told me, so this is a cluster F. These people
[54:35.840 --> 54:40.560]  are idiots. I have a bad feeling. I said, come on, Roger. I mean, I really twisted your arm. And
[54:40.560 --> 54:45.600]  then I just thought that I can't believe how surrounded Trump was with traders. You know,
[54:45.600 --> 54:49.280]  they would he would sign executive orders, as you know, they admit that they would throw them in
[54:49.280 --> 54:55.200]  the trash. So they tried to set us all up that day. I think it basically was a dud, a misfire.
[54:55.200 --> 54:59.600]  What do you think? Well, what you say is absolutely right. The president ordered the
[54:59.600 --> 55:04.560]  declassification of the documents that would approve that the Mueller investigation was a
[55:04.560 --> 55:09.840]  politically motivated fraud. And the bureaucrats did nothing until Rick Grinnell took the position
[55:09.840 --> 55:16.160]  of acting director of intelligence and forced them finally to release those documents. Now,
[55:16.160 --> 55:21.120]  it's not even debatable. Anybody who cries to claim that the Mueller investigation was legitimate
[55:21.120 --> 55:25.120]  merely needs to look at those documents. And again, we again pioneered that Trump was being
[55:25.120 --> 55:29.040]  illegally spot on during the campaign. And as President Trump, and that's why they want to
[55:29.040 --> 55:33.680]  destroy us. And the only point is that the listeners to say, we have delivered the goods.
[55:33.680 --> 55:38.880]  We are the real deal. We need you to magnify what we say and do and to support us because they're
[55:38.880 --> 55:43.200]  both trying to destroy us. I'm not going to spend time whining about it. I'm just saying we are
[55:43.200 --> 55:49.120]  under attack. We need your prayers and financial support now. Well, I was glad you opened this
[55:49.120 --> 55:52.960]  segment with the proverb. I'm going to be honest with you, Alex. I'm saying the Rosary now twice
[55:52.960 --> 55:58.960]  today, every day. And it brings me great solace. It brings me great calm because this is a battle
[55:58.960 --> 56:05.280]  for the future of Western civilizations and the future of our country. And there's and I really
[56:05.280 --> 56:11.360]  fervently hope that the president will select one strong, good, honest, tough lawyer to represent
[56:11.360 --> 56:17.920]  him in New York. No one ever built a statue to a committee. War councils breed defeat.
[56:18.560 --> 56:24.400]  The Douglas MacArthur said that. And it's true. The president is facing completely bogus,
[56:24.400 --> 56:29.360]  manufactured, politically motivated charges that are an attempt to derail any attempt.
[56:29.360 --> 56:32.240]  So you're saying so far. I mean, I know you have great sources. You've been proven right.
[56:32.240 --> 56:37.280]  They are planning to indict his organization. Yes, there's no question whatsoever. And then
[56:37.280 --> 56:43.120]  they are squeezing Matt Calamari, good friend of mine, a guy I've known for 30 years who was
[56:43.840 --> 56:48.160]  became chief operating officer of the company. They're squeezing Allen Weisselberg,
[56:48.160 --> 56:55.840]  Trump's longtime CFO, also a fine man. This is outrageous, absolutely outrageous. And then
[56:55.840 --> 57:01.440]  Alex, we get into this on the other side, but I want to talk about the stunning arrest of the two
[57:01.440 --> 57:06.000]  James Cusick senior and junior, both pastors, both ministers, neither one of them charged
[57:06.000 --> 57:12.960]  with violent crimes, but an FBI raid at their home that reminded me very much of the early
[57:12.960 --> 57:21.840]  morning pre-dawn assault on my home by 29 SWAT clad assault weapon bearing FBI agents.
[57:21.840 --> 57:26.240]  We're talking real tomorrow's news today. One more statement with Roger Stone,
[57:26.240 --> 57:30.240]  and then Mike Lindell is going to join us in the latest on the audit and the information
[57:30.240 --> 57:34.880]  coming out and how the Democrats are so panicked by that. That's why ahead of the Arizona audit,
[57:34.880 --> 57:40.400]  as you said a month ago, Roger, a head of that coming out in early July, they're going to indict
[57:40.400 --> 57:45.600]  the Trump organization, which is really very rarely indict the organization before people,
[57:45.600 --> 57:47.760]  but it shows they have nothing. We'll be right back.
[57:52.000 --> 57:56.720]  The globalists are having their revolution, but for humanity has to have its revolution.
[57:56.720 --> 58:05.600]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological
[58:05.600 --> 58:13.760]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[58:14.800 --> 58:18.560]  Orson slaves are just just property from cradle to grave of the system,
[58:19.600 --> 58:26.160]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic
[58:26.160 --> 58:31.920]  control. We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world that realizes a nightmare
[58:31.920 --> 58:36.400]  dystopia, and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[58:37.120 --> 58:40.240]  It's that choice. It's that realization that's going to change the world,
[58:41.280 --> 58:44.880]  and it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, good or evil.
[58:45.760 --> 58:48.880]  It is a spiritual battle, an info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[58:50.480 --> 58:55.200]  I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because the
[58:55.200 --> 59:00.080]  scientific literature is overwhelming. It's good for your heart, your brain, your whole body,
[59:00.080 --> 59:04.320]  your well-being. A lot of folks take it before they take a test. People that have arthritis
[59:04.320 --> 59:09.040]  pain, they take it. It's well known for the things it does for a body. It makes our lives
[59:09.040 --> 59:14.880]  so much better. Then I learned about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil, and we've got
[59:14.880 --> 59:19.120]  both at FullWarsTour.com. But with the COVID lockdown, supply chains have broken down,
[59:19.120 --> 59:22.880]  so it's been months and months and months since we've had krill oil back at stock.
[59:22.880 --> 59:26.240]  Well, let's back, ladies and gentlemen. And despite the fact that it's already very
[59:26.240 --> 59:32.560]  fairly priced for the grade it is, highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited time
[59:32.560 --> 59:37.360]  at infowarstour.com with free shipping and double-paid free of points. Because I want
[59:37.360 --> 59:40.320]  those of you that have already been customers to have a chance to get more of it, and I want new
[59:40.320 --> 59:44.880]  viewers and listeners who haven't tried it to get it from us, and then try regular krill oil
[59:44.880 --> 59:53.200]  that is not one-tenth as powerful as ours. This is the highest grade back at stock at FullWarsTour.com.
[1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:36.400]  So I love Trump. I think Trump's great, but he'll either be the best president we ever had or the
[1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:40.080]  worst president because either he's the best because we end up taking the country back or he's the
[1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:45.200]  worst because he's summoned the left to rise up and take our country over. In closing, Roger,
[1:00:46.160 --> 1:00:52.160]  we were making some other great points as we went to break here. Other areas you'd like to cover?
[1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:59.520]  The extraordinarily good reporting by Darren Beatty at The Revolver and by Tucker Carlson
[1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:04.880]  that I think are really beginning to make the case that the January 6th insurrection
[1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:11.360]  was an FBI-directed operation. This is vital, vital reporting. If you haven't seen it, I'm not
[1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:17.280]  surprised because the mainstream media is doing everything humanly possible to censor it. But
[1:01:17.280 --> 1:01:23.680]  it is very important to note this case in Florida where the FBI came with the local county sheriff
[1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:31.520]  to arrest 73-year-old Vietnam veteran, Purple Heart veteran, James Cusick Sr., who's not even charged
[1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:37.280]  with a violent crime, who's essentially charged with trespassing. His son was also arrested.
[1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:44.880]  He's also a pastor. And it took me back to that morning, January 25th, 2019, when the taxpayers
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:54.240]  footed the bill for $1.1 million and 29 SWAT-clad assault weapon bearing, night goggle-wearing FBI
[1:01:54.240 --> 1:02:00.560]  agents surrounded my home. The worst part of that was when they perp walked my wife out of the house
[1:02:00.560 --> 1:02:04.960]  for the CNN cameras, even though she was charged with no crime. And by the way, Roger, I was just
[1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:10.160]  reliving that watching the video, unlike you being there. These guys are pointing assault
[1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:15.200]  rifles at your stomach while your hands are up. It's just, it's ridiculous. It's all makeup,
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:19.600]  like wonderland. Like, they're the good guys. You're the bad guy. It's all just fiction.
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:26.560]  It's true. And we now know it definitively because he stupidly left his meditag initials
[1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:32.960]  on the documents that Andrew Weissman, the epically corrupt former federal prosecutor,
[1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:40.320]  leaked my indictment to CNN, and he arranged for them to be there. I can prove that if necessary,
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:46.880]  or I should say when necessary. How ironic, Alex, that the New York Bar Association has suspended
[1:02:46.880 --> 1:02:52.560]  Rudy Giuliani's law license not because he broke the law and has been convicted, not because he's
[1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:57.120]  violated the canon of ethics or any of the rules of the New York Bar, but because he expressed
[1:02:57.120 --> 1:03:00.480]  his First Amendment right to express the fact that he didn't think the election was on.
[1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:05.120]  They say in it to back you up. They say he questioned the election. That's not allowed.
[1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:10.960]  Well, but here's the point. It's the same New York Bar Association that declined to prosecute
[1:03:10.960 --> 1:03:17.920]  Andrew Weissman when he locked the 30-year-old CFO of Enron in a coffin-sized metal box and left him
[1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:23.920]  there in the hot sun in order to get him to testify the way he wanted them to. The New York Bar
[1:03:23.920 --> 1:03:29.120]  Association is a political body. It's a criminal enterprise, if you asked me. And this is a
[1:03:29.120 --> 1:03:35.520]  disgraceful act against a great American. Rudy Giuliani has done nothing wrong. But here's why
[1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:41.760]  he's being tortured and why he's being excoriated. He knows what's in the Hunter Biden emails.
[1:03:41.760 --> 1:03:46.320]  If you saw this incredible story by Miranda Devine, who, by the way, I think maybe the
[1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:51.920]  single best investigative journalist working in America today, her bullshit detector is the best
[1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:57.040]  out there. She is the single best columnist at the New York Post, and she tells an extraordinary
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:03.360]  story of Hunter Biden going to the Chateau Marmont. That's a watering hole for the entertainment
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:09.440]  elite in Hollywood. He hires a Russian hooker from a local escort service. He plays with her
[1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:14.400]  all night, but then when he puts in his credit card to pay her, it's declined. He puts it in a
[1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:21.120]  second time. It's declined. He then whoops out another credit card that belongs to Joe Biden,
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:25.440]  and it goes through. What he didn't know is the first two charges went through as well.
[1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:30.880]  So he ended up paying $25,000 for a Russian hooker. And who shows up to bail him out?
[1:04:30.880 --> 1:04:35.280]  Why? It's the secret service. Of course, they deny that they had any involvement.
[1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:40.720]  Hold on, Roger. I got Mike Lindell coming on, and we're getting him on. But it's a 60-second
[1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:44.880]  break. I don't need to recap this investigative journalist at the New York Post for like two
[1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:48.880]  minutes. Just get to the rest of this. We come back in 60 seconds. This is too important
[1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:53.040]  to end it right now. Roger Stone. And we'll tell other viewers and listeners how to find
[1:04:53.040 --> 1:05:10.800]  Roger Stone's website. Mike Lindell is coming up as well. Back in 60 seconds.

[1:06:16.400 --> 1:06:22.400]  Alex Jones.
[1:06:22.400 --> 1:06:32.400]  So
[1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:50.160]  ladies and gentlemen, Mike Lindell is gonna be joining us here in about three minutes.
[1:06:50.160 --> 1:06:56.240]  He's been valiantly fighting, exposing election fraud, massive proof already coming out in Arizona
[1:06:56.240 --> 1:07:00.640]  and many other states. It's just overwhelming. But the mainstream media gaslighting is saying
[1:07:00.640 --> 1:07:05.280]  none of that exists. In fact, questioning it should be illegal. They're saying we're getting
[1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:09.760]  Mike Lindell on right now. We'll be talking to him. He's got major developments and breaking news as
[1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:16.080]  he continues to barnstorm the country, rallying Americans to stand up for voting rights integrity.
[1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:21.120]  We just narrowly defeated the Democrats federalizing elections and putting in all their illegal
[1:07:21.120 --> 1:07:26.160]  actions to steal further elections. This is just a down the wire fight for this country.
[1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:30.080]  But Roger Stone, who joined us the last hour, dropped a bombshell at the end. And yes, I've
[1:07:30.080 --> 1:07:34.320]  seen the big investigative journalist at the New York Post. I'm familiar with her work.
[1:07:34.320 --> 1:07:39.680]  I know Giuliani's being persecuted, has law license script because he exposed the laptop.
[1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:44.320]  And Roger, you were starting to get into that recap just briefly. What happened and where
[1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:48.320]  this is going? Because here they are saying they're about to try to indict the Trump Organization,
[1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:54.160]  unheard of, no evidence when we have Hunter being a Chinese spy and his father. It's just incredible.
[1:07:55.280 --> 1:08:00.080]  Well, first of all, let me commend your next guest, Mike Lindell. He is a great patriot
[1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:04.800]  and a man who has the courage to put his money where his mouth is. He is extraordinarily selfless,
[1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:10.720]  and he's done an incredible job of exposing the single greatest fraud in American history,
[1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:17.440]  a true patriot. Alex, it's very, very clear that there's a two steered justice system.
[1:08:17.440 --> 1:08:22.320]  Hunter Biden can drop the N word. Didn't see Al Sharpe in complaining about that or Jesse
[1:08:22.320 --> 1:08:29.280]  Jackson. He can take in millions of dollars. He still owes a substantial portfolio in a
[1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:34.160]  Communist Chinese backed investment fund. Joe Biden told us in the debate that none of his
[1:08:34.160 --> 1:08:39.600]  children would have any foreign investments while he was president. But this $200 million stake is
[1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:45.520]  still in the Chinese company. He's clearly had sex with underage women. We have seen the videos
[1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:53.360]  with our own eyes. He has raked in millions from Ukraine, from China, even U.S. companies,
[1:08:53.360 --> 1:08:59.360]  but he hasn't been charged in a civil suit over taxes by the IRS, although we're told there's an
[1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:06.720]  open investigation. There's no ends to which they will go to cover for this guy. Why is he not being
[1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:12.320]  subjected to the same laws that other people are, myself specifically? The government is
[1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:16.960]  harassing me over interest in penalties and back taxes when I've paid them over a half
[1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:22.800]  million dollars in taxes over the last four years on a monthly basis and would have continued to pay
[1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:28.160]  had they not destroyed me financially in the mother investigation. And now, as you know,
[1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:33.040]  with my wife suffering from stage four cancer, I've got to go out and raise the money for her
[1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:37.120]  treatment. And that was my next question. People don't know what it's like to be attacked. And when
[1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:41.920]  you stand up like a Mike Lindell or Roger Stone or Donald Trump, you get indicted, you get attacked,
[1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:47.280]  you get sued, you get demonized. How does everybody get a Roger Stone did nothing wrong
[1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:51.680]  t-shirt to help spread the word and fund your operation? Well, first of all, if you want to help
[1:09:52.240 --> 1:09:57.600]  pay for my wife's cancer treatments and her care, you can go to stonefamilyfund.com.
[1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:04.080]  I particularly want to thank Mike Adams of the Health Ranger. The Health Ranger,
[1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:08.880]  it's not that he's given me medical advice, he hasn't, but he has given me a donated a number
[1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:13.920]  of products that based on my own research, I know are very effective in the fighting of cancer.
[1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:18.000]  So God bless you, Mike, and God bless all the people who are helping my wife in this
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:23.360]  extraordinarily valiant battle. If you want to get your Roger Stone did nothing wrong t-shirt,
[1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:29.200]  you need to go to thestonecoldtruth.com in the store. Actually, I think it's under construction
[1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:33.920]  at this moment. We'll be back with a new payment processor. You know, I know what you've been
[1:10:33.920 --> 1:10:38.000]  through. That's why I want to support you. And we just really appreciate you and President Trump
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:41.280]  and Mike Lindell and others, because I'm one of the few people that actually knows what it's like
[1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:44.640]  to stand up against them. And I know we've been persecuted. So we're going to hang together,
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:49.200]  hang separate. As Benjamin Franklin said, thank you so much, Roger. Great to be here. And I'm
[1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:55.280]  going to hang on and watch Mike Lindell, a great patriot. Absolutely. Now, there goes Roger Stone.
[1:10:56.080 --> 1:11:02.400]  Mike Lindell has been charging around the country, exposing the incredible fraud of a
[1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:07.200]  selection. The amount of evidence has come out of Arizona and Pennsylvania and Georgia. And now
[1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:12.560]  the Georgia governor and others are having to admit that there was fraud and the Democrats are
[1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:16.880]  getting scared. They're all over the news, but also Mitt Romney and other Democrat with an arm
[1:11:16.880 --> 1:11:20.720]  in front of his name. You say, oh, this is terrible. This is bad. When they pledged to
[1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:25.520]  challenge the election, no matter what happened, because they knew Trump was winning by massive
[1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:29.680]  numbers. So Mike Lindell has been the tip of the spear out there, traveling all over the country.
[1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:33.440]  He's got his ear to the ground, the latest information. He joins us for the balance of the
[1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:37.760]  hour. Mike Lindell, of course, founder of MyPillow as well. Thank you so much for coming on.
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:45.520]  Oh, thanks for having me on. And yeah, I'm praying for Roger's wife there. She's going to be great.
[1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:54.160]  And I'm just praying that she gets the right care and gets through this. He got through.
[1:11:54.160 --> 1:12:00.160]  We're all getting through all the attacks on us as patriots. And I'll tell you, right now,
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:08.720]  I just was in D.C. this week for the Dominion lawsuit to get him to drop it against myself
[1:12:08.720 --> 1:12:16.000]  in MyPill, Sidney Powell, and you had Rudy's case too. But just like Ellen Dershowitz said,
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:21.840]  this is the most important case in history for our First Amendment rights of free speech.
[1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:27.600]  And I kind of got that, you know, when I was there, I had this big old bouquet of microphones out
[1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:33.920]  in front of me. And all I did was sit and tell them all about my symposium, my cyber symposium
[1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:39.120]  coming up, and they're going, but Mike, you're getting through today. How's this case going to
[1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:42.880]  come out and all this? And I said, you know what, I'm here to talk to you guys because this is the
[1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:49.200]  only time you talk to me. And even Fox showed up. Fox actually showed up. Of course, they didn't
[1:12:49.200 --> 1:12:54.080]  say anything or didn't do anything as usual, but they did show up. I've been really getting on their
[1:12:54.080 --> 1:13:00.000]  case. They didn't show up for the rally last night. Horrible, horrible network right now that
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:06.080]  can't even, it's one thing to not to say bad things out there, the fake news, but then to not say
[1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:12.160]  nothing when they're needed the most is horrific. Because I mean, you're the man in the arena,
[1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:17.440]  like Teddy Roosevelt talked about, you are in there. I see you at midnight on shows at seven
[1:13:17.440 --> 1:13:21.600]  a.m. I should be working here. I mean, but you seem energized and they're like, Oh yeah, you're
[1:13:21.600 --> 1:13:25.520]  being sued. I'm sure you're willing to die for your country. I am too. That like because some
[1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:30.160]  globalist organization has come after you or somebody sued you that that means you're bad. No,
[1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:36.240]  that means the system is coming after you and America, the polls show the vast majority of
[1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:40.080]  America believes the election was stolen. So you're on the right side of history and their gas
[1:13:40.080 --> 1:13:44.720]  lighting isn't working. So Mike, anywhere you want to begin on what you're doing, where it's going,
[1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:52.240]  what we can do. Well, I want to say this is, you know, the what we it's you're right, it's
[1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:57.280]  becoming more and more every day. I think it's up to like 80% of Republicans, almost 30% of
[1:13:57.280 --> 1:14:03.200]  Democrats believe that this election was taken from us. And then it was an attack by China,
[1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:09.600]  the CCP, using the Democrat Party. Now, I have spent, here's what I told the media this week.
[1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:14.560]  I've spent five months now since that piece of evidence that came on January night,
[1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:20.320]  telling him I have this, I have this for everyone now that parts down. I call that, you know,
[1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:26.000]  the first part of this marketing is done. And I think all the left wing garbage media from the
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  daily base to the, to the business insider CNN, all of them, they kept me in the news. So at
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:37.120]  least I was able to say, they go, Mike, you lost four more retailers today. I go, did you hear
[1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:42.720]  about Dominion? Did you hear about China attacking our country? So we go on and on. I was able to
[1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:48.400]  get the word out. I think everybody knows out there that I have something. I want to say,
[1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:54.560]  I want to say this. So when I was, when I got to the case in, in DC this week, here's why it's so
[1:14:54.560 --> 1:14:59.360]  important. If that judge, there's two things I want to tell you about here that are very important.
[1:14:59.360 --> 1:15:03.920]  This is very important. We are going to get this election pulled down and Delchamp will be in power
[1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:08.400]  this fall. I'll tell you how that's going to happen in a minute. But I will tell you this,
[1:15:08.400 --> 1:15:14.960]  this judge that has to make a decision on these cases, whether they can move forward or not,
[1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:21.440]  is so important. And here's why. If he says they can move forward, then you know what? From this
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:27.760]  day on, anybody that says anything wrong, like I talk, I bad mouth suck a buck from Facebook every
[1:15:27.760 --> 1:15:34.000]  day. I bad mouth Jack Dorsey from Twitter. Are they going to all come and sue me now? Because
[1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:40.880]  you know, where's our free right of free speech? We got a long segments coming up. I got a little
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:44.240]  late. I apologize. I want you to have before we come back. We have to hear right. The left's trying
[1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:49.440]  to criminalize free speech in America with lawfare. What you're doing is God's work. You're in the
[1:15:49.440 --> 1:15:53.920]  right. I believe you're a hundred percent right from my own research. And so we all need to support
[1:15:53.920 --> 1:16:02.560]  you. We'll be right back. I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021. And I just want
[1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:07.040]  to say something. I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come
[1:16:07.040 --> 1:16:11.360]  together over the years. And it's truly an answer to prayer. And I am so blessed and thankful
[1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:15.840]  for all of you, the listeners of this show. I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:20.320]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter. You got red blood.
[1:16:20.320 --> 1:16:25.360]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:30.000]  and sisters together. And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:35.360]  years. And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working under the future. But again, that's
[1:16:35.360 --> 1:16:41.680]  really up to you and up to God. So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your
[1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:45.600]  heart to support us. But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to
[1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:50.320]  thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done. And just ask you
[1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:55.040]  again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you. And hopefully God will touch your heart
[1:16:55.040 --> 1:17:02.960]  to continue to support him for worse. God bless. As men age, they often experience a slowdown

[1:18:58.720 --> 1:19:04.480]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large. The population has been trained to submit,
[1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:09.200]  do what you're told, and it's all going to pass. But if you study authoritarians, if you study
[1:19:09.200 --> 1:19:13.360]  the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta and
[1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:17.680]  you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved. And because the globalists see us as
[1:19:17.680 --> 1:19:22.480]  weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move. And they are collapsing the third world
[1:19:22.480 --> 1:19:28.320]  with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon
[1:19:28.320 --> 1:19:33.920]  to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN whatever agreements
[1:19:33.920 --> 1:19:38.800]  they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees,
[1:19:38.800 --> 1:19:44.880]  not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying,
[1:19:44.880 --> 1:19:51.120]  but fleeing the year long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute,
[1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:57.280]  or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money. And that's why we have to really get educated
[1:19:57.280 --> 1:20:13.200]  about the globalist. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:18.240 --> 1:20:23.360]  Welcome back, folks. Michael and Dell is with us for the next three segments on this Sunday evening.
[1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:31.360]  I really appreciate you all for joining us this evening. He is embattled. He is being
[1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:36.960]  attacked. That's what you'd expect to happen to somebody exposing an attempt to take over of
[1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:42.080]  this country. And we see it on every front now. I have the national strategy for countering domestic
[1:20:42.080 --> 1:20:46.480]  terrorism right here. Next segment I'm going to show you where it says questioning the election
[1:20:46.480 --> 1:20:52.160]  is terrorism. Well, I thought that was my first amendment right. So Mr. Lendell, that's founder
[1:20:52.160 --> 1:20:58.000]  of MyPillow. That's where we were, MyPillow.com, Frankspeech.com, LendellRecoveryNetwork.org.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:01.440]  We'll talk more about that before you leave us. But please continue, sir, with what you were
[1:21:01.440 --> 1:21:09.680]  getting into about this battle for free speech. Well, that's one part that this battle we're
[1:21:09.680 --> 1:21:16.080]  under. And we've got to pray this judge makes the right decision because otherwise going forward,
[1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:19.760]  it's going to be horrific where you're going to get people are going to be afraid to talk about it.
[1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:24.000]  It's going to be 1984. You're not going to be able to talk about anything because you're going to
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:28.960]  be afraid of being sued. And that's exactly what you said, Alex, with the law fear that
[1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:35.440]  Dominion used and Smartmatic. And they used it, you know, when they used it on, their first lawsuit
[1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:40.720]  was November 9th. They've got over 200 lawsuits and threatening letters. But then they used it on
[1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:46.880]  Fox. You've got to wonder there. I love picking on Fox right now because it's just shameful that
[1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:50.880]  they won't even they didn't even show up the President's rally. They won't let me come on
[1:21:50.880 --> 1:21:55.520]  for interviews. They won't talk about what we have. And now I'm going to tell you what we do have
[1:21:56.160 --> 1:22:03.360]  and and the plan to bring down this election. Since January 9th, I got evidence that day that
[1:22:03.360 --> 1:22:09.840]  was different. It was the only thing that explained the massive millions and millions of millions of
[1:22:09.840 --> 1:22:16.000]  of the ballots that were different. I mean, that that didn't make sense. I said, I said, even this
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:21.280]  was my own investigation going, it doesn't make sense. The numbers don't add up. But I mean,
[1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:25.600]  grass don't go straight up. You don't have a round curve. It's normal. And all of a sudden,
[1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:30.240]  it pops straight up. Trump right when they closed the counting errors.
[1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:36.160]  That's right. And that was their reaction to it, too. By the way, there was these algorithms that
[1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:42.960]  went through every state. But here's what we have. And what I have and that I have what's called
[1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:48.800]  packet captures. And I want everybody to write that down. I even told Jim Acosta called me from
[1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:56.080]  CNN. I go, Jim, it's over. I have all the packet captures for the whole election. And I said,
[1:22:56.080 --> 1:23:03.440]  go look it up and see what that means. And what it means is these are non subjective. These are
[1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:08.400]  the things that go through the internet. If you capture them, they're like taking pictures of what
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:14.400]  actually happened. But pictures you can't change, you can alter in any way, shape, or form. I was
[1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:19.840]  with a gal yesterday. And she's a cyber expert. I said, what if I told you I had all the packet
[1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:25.280]  captures for the whole election? And she her mouth dropped. She goes, and she told us other
[1:23:25.280 --> 1:23:30.560]  people in the group, she says, it'd be over. Whatever that shows, it's over, you know, everything
[1:23:30.560 --> 1:23:36.080]  about it. So here's what we're going to do. It's called a cyber symposium. I'm going to lay out the
[1:23:36.080 --> 1:23:41.520]  plan now. This is a two month plan. And Donald Trump will be back in office. Here's what it is.
[1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:47.440]  I'm we're getting on July 4. I'm hoping July 4. I want to announce the venue. I'm going to announce
[1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:54.000]  the dates in August. It's going to be a three day event. It's a cyber symposium. And what we're
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:58.880]  bringing there, we're bringing all my experts I've had, all my white hat experts there that
[1:23:58.880 --> 1:24:03.040]  validated this evidence from the government. They're all going to be there. I've got them
[1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:08.000]  probably 12, 15 of them, different ones from different parts of the country. Then we're inviting
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:15.280]  every cyber expert that has CI SSP credentials. They also have to have they have to be high up
[1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:20.640]  where they know that they're experts in cyber forensic. Now, there'll be hundreds of them.
[1:24:20.640 --> 1:24:25.520]  I mean, I have five different countries that have also called me. They also want their cyber guys
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:31.200]  there. So now you have this big, big event, this big place, you have all the cyber guys,
[1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:37.920]  then we're inviting all the media, maybe even Fox will show up. What a concept. All the regardless
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:42.560]  of all the independent media needs to come. I think Trump needs to come. Members of congressman
[1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:49.520]  gozer needs to come championing to be there. Right, right. So you got all the media and that's
[1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:54.000]  and there's other countries and media talk them to they're all coming. Then you've got the next
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:25:01.120]  ring. The next ring is we want every senator, congressman, attorney general, secretary of state.
[1:25:01.840 --> 1:25:06.400]  We want governors there. We want the lead fact checkers for Facebook,
[1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:11.040]  Crooked Allen Duke. We want him there. We want Bill Barr there. We have anyone that's ever
[1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:17.040]  doubted this. I have one doubt. I want them all there. This place will hold 5000 people.
[1:25:17.040 --> 1:25:23.120]  It's a three day event. We're going to pass out the package. Here you go. And every single person
[1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:28.320]  by the time they leave, even within an hour, they're going to go, wow, do you know the date yet?
[1:25:28.320 --> 1:25:32.800]  Because I'm coming. This is what what's the day? No, no, this is what this is what I said. We're
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:37.840]  going to announce right around the fourth on the date. It's probably going to be right around the
[1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:42.880]  10th, 11th, the 12th of August. I will have that date and then we'll and then what we need everybody
[1:25:42.880 --> 1:25:47.600]  to do a general error because I was going to go for a week with my kids to the beach in in early
[1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:51.280]  August. So I just want to know because I'm going to plan my vacation around this. This is important.
[1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:56.960]  Yeah, this is the biggest. This will be the biggest. I want to be the biggest the biggest beauty
[1:25:56.960 --> 1:26:02.400]  bend in history right up there with Elvis Presley. Hello, everyone goes into the independent media
[1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:06.240]  puts it out. It will no matter what. I just want to expand on something. Everything you said months
[1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:10.720]  ago is coming out in Arizona. Everybody forgets have come out there that they erased all the
[1:26:10.720 --> 1:26:15.200]  computer tapes with all the metadata is what you're talking about. But there are server farms
[1:26:15.200 --> 1:26:19.760]  that have copies of that. So every step of the way they've been desperately covering up and in
[1:26:19.760 --> 1:26:24.560]  Georgia as you know now, the Secretary of State and others have to admit there now was fraud and
[1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:29.280]  they admit the double counting of ballots that you said five months ago. So if you're being
[1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:35.440]  vindicated, right, right. Well, this and here's what you need to know. Everybody needs to know
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:41.920]  this where what I have for the pack the packet captures. I don't even need all them on it.
[1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:47.360]  We don't need all that stuff. But that validates that you're exactly right. You can get if you
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:52.000]  that's why Arizona doesn't want to give up the router. The routers are very important. They show
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:56.880]  who did it. They show everything. But we already know that we already know we have it for the whole
[1:26:56.880 --> 1:27:03.680]  election. We have it for every every vote in the election, every flip, everything. So we've had this
[1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:08.800]  now it's just a matter when we do this cyber symposium, the whole world has to do it because
[1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:13.840]  it's non subjective evidence. Then right after we do right after we do this, we're going to have a
[1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:18.640]  plan for everybody to reach out to their senators, their congressmen and get everybody there.
[1:27:18.640 --> 1:27:24.880]  Now, right after we do this symposium, we already have the lawsuit ready for the Supreme Court.
[1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:30.880]  And it's called a quo warranty. We're going to drop it on them and drop it in the Supreme Court.
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:35.520]  Now, everyone says Mike, they won't even look at with the pressure of the whole world,
[1:27:35.520 --> 1:27:40.720]  seeing that this was an attack by China. And they're going to accept it so fast, it's going to
[1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:45.200]  throw you in there. Let me say something. Let me tell you a segment coming up. Stay there. The system
[1:27:45.200 --> 1:27:49.280]  gas lights and makes fun of you and makes fun of Trump and me and everybody that we dare question
[1:27:49.280 --> 1:27:54.000]  this when the evidence is overwhelming. If we don't challenge it, it'll never stop, regardless of
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:57.040]  what happens. And I think you've got a good chance of changing this, but it doesn't matter. If you
[1:27:57.040 --> 1:28:02.560]  didn't take action, we'd have no chance. Definitely your work has helped precipitate them beating
[1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:07.280]  HR one that would have federalized elections under the Democrats control. So regardless,
[1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:11.120]  we've got to discredit this election because it was a fraud to not let them do it again.
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:15.600]  So either way, we win by fighting back, even if you don't get Trump reinstated,
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:19.440]  and I'm not taking it away from you. That could happen. I agree. It should happen.
[1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:26.800]  I'm simply saying we only lose by not taking action. And I admire you so much because you've
[1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:30.240]  been the man in the arena. We got to go to break long segment coming up. You're going to have the
[1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:35.840]  floor again to lay it all out. Mike Lindell of my pillow.com. And I know they persecuted him and
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:39.680]  tried to bankrupt him and come after him. And we've been a big flood of support at first. But
[1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:44.160]  then that ebbs go to my pillow.com already owns with the great pillows. I bought a whole bunch
[1:28:44.160 --> 1:28:47.680]  when I saw him doing the right thing. Everybody should go to my pillow.com and support him
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:52.160]  because he is pouring everything he's got in the fight for America for all of our futures. We salute
[1:28:52.160 --> 1:29:04.160]  Mike Lindell. Good globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its
[1:29:04.160 --> 1:29:12.880]  revolution. We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire
[1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:19.280]  biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled
[1:29:21.200 --> 1:29:26.480]  slaves. Orson slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system,
[1:29:26.480 --> 1:29:34.480]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[1:29:35.040 --> 1:29:40.480]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world that realizes a nightmare dystopia and
[1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:45.760]  we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia. It's that choice.
[1:29:46.320 --> 1:29:51.440]  It's that realization that's going to change the world. And it's the only choice we've got,
[1:29:51.440 --> 1:29:56.640]  freedom or slavery, go to evil. It is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fight
[1:29:56.640 --> 1:30:03.600]  again. I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person. And so as bad as things are with
[1:30:03.600 --> 1:30:07.520]  the globalist attacking humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you
[1:30:07.520 --> 1:30:13.840]  to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well. I'm a public figure, so I get to see
[1:30:13.840 --> 1:30:18.160]  things zero public doesn't get to see. And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of
[1:30:18.160 --> 1:30:25.600]  Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really
[1:30:25.600 --> 1:30:30.560]  awake in the establishment. They don't want to go on with a globalist, but they're scared,
[1:30:30.560 --> 1:30:35.760]  they're looking for leadership. Well, that's where info wars comes in. You fund us, you support
[1:30:35.760 --> 1:30:40.560]  info wars.com, you get great products at the same time. We will then go out and do what the
[1:30:40.560 --> 1:30:46.000]  globalist says is unpopular, what the globalist will target you for to show people that it's safe
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:52.400]  to tell the truth and to take the heat. That's our job. So please keep us on air so we can hit
[1:30:52.400 --> 1:30:57.680]  the barbed wire so we can be the shock groups for the information war. Fund us at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:58.400 --> 1:31:04.080]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone for beta
[1:31:04.080 --> 1:31:10.160]  testing to operational. The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover,
[1:31:10.160 --> 1:31:14.800]  their robot takeover. But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others
[1:31:14.800 --> 1:31:19.360]  have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[1:31:19.360 --> 1:31:23.840]  Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[1:31:23.840 --> 1:31:28.000]  we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:32.720]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others
[1:31:32.720 --> 1:31:38.000]  is absolutely essential. And at the same time, supporting info wars by buying high-quality
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family,

[1:32:57.680 --> 1:33:04.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:37.200]  It's an inside job by the world connected.
[1:33:44.080 --> 1:33:47.280]  All right, when I say I admire Mike Lindell, I mean, I really do.
[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:52.480]  And you learn when things get rough, who the good guys are, who the bad guys are, and
[1:33:52.480 --> 1:33:56.880]  they're trying to indict Trump and his company in the next week or two. They are trying to go
[1:33:56.880 --> 1:34:00.000]  up his family. They're trying to go after us. They're going after Mike Lindell with all these fake
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:05.840]  lawsuits with these big giant companies. And it's just so corrupt. And they are going after
[1:34:05.840 --> 1:34:10.080]  everybody, but that's okay because somebody's got to stand up in the breach. So Mike,
[1:34:10.080 --> 1:34:16.160]  you got caught off by breaking in mypelo.com. Mike Lindell is here. You are getting into,
[1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:20.880]  again, this big event you've got coming up, all the validation that's coming out, the polls
[1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:27.440]  going from 60% of Republicans to 80 plus percent from 25% of Democrats, some polls as high as 40%
[1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:32.800]  actually. Nobody is that I know is buying this. They've got a problem. Their surrogates are all
[1:34:32.800 --> 1:34:39.600]  over TV attacking Trump saying how dare him say he never conceded. So you're giving Trump strength.
[1:34:39.600 --> 1:34:43.200]  And I see him getting more bold things to you and others. And that's where we need to go with
[1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:46.560]  this because these people are a fraud. They don't want the country to even exist. Mike Lindell,
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:53.440]  please continue. Well, yeah, last night at the rally in Ohio, we had, when he introduced me,
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:59.840]  I mean, the crowd went crazy. And like when him and I talked, they were there. You wouldn't
[1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:04.960]  have them there if you had lost their election fair and square. They're there because they're
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:10.880]  supporting. They want the, you know, it's not just me or you, you know, just a few people out
[1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:16.880]  fighting. The whole country now doesn't believe this. They know this was an attack. They know
[1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:22.160]  what's in office now, the damage they're doing to our country. I think he pointed that out real
[1:35:22.160 --> 1:35:29.920]  good at the rally. You know, great decisions got us to December of 2019 before the China virus.
[1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:35.520]  Now, every decision coming out of DC, just take your little book out. I don't care if you're a
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:41.920]  Democrat or Republican, if you're just a person and you go, how does this help me? It doesn't.
[1:35:41.920 --> 1:35:48.000]  It doesn't help either anybody, these decisions. You can go right down to 40-some executive orders
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:53.600]  and go, let's see, how can we, you know, if you, I'll tell you, it helps the CCP. It helps
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:36:00.000]  another country. And this is what's actually helping our cause here because everybody,
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:05.760]  I'm giving everybody an out. When we do this cyber symposium, which, which will be seen,
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:10.720]  it needs to be seen. And the people that need to be there are all the politicians.
[1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:17.040]  Let me just back you up and I'm going to shut up and give you the floor here. But I mean,
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:20.960]  they're acting really scared on the news now. Like, don't, don't stop. Don't investigate.
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:25.360]  This is wrong. You're not supposed to do this. No, Arizona. Oh, no, Georgia. Oh, I mean, they
[1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:29.440]  are really acting scared. They've got all their talking heads out there. That shows me that you're
[1:36:29.440 --> 1:36:36.560]  on to something bigger. Oh, absolutely. You know, when they attack me, everybody knows from January
[1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:42.560]  nine to the 15th, and then beyond that, I've been attacked every day. Every single day,
[1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:47.600]  my box stores attacked people I do business, but they went all the way back to my second
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:53.440]  grade teachers. I mean, they went over overseas to every, everywhere I do business, they attacked
[1:36:53.440 --> 1:37:00.000]  them. So they dropped my pillow and attacked my pillow. They sued my pillow, sued, sued myself.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:05.120]  I had Facebook, Twitter, everything come at me. Now, but then all of a sudden, everybody,
[1:37:05.120 --> 1:37:11.920]  it kind of just changed now. I can say any, I used to use the left, the left media to get my
[1:37:11.920 --> 1:37:16.080]  narrative out there. And they can attack me. But as long as they put it in, Mike still,
[1:37:16.080 --> 1:37:20.400]  but Mike Lindell believes he's got the, the evidence for the election. No, I don't believe
[1:37:20.400 --> 1:37:25.280]  that because you're such a lovable guy, you did such a great job on the late night comic shows.
[1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:29.920]  It blew up in their face. You beat them so they won't. Now you're kryptonite.
[1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:37.200]  Yeah. Well, now they won't talk. I talked to them. I did a half hour in DC this week,
[1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:41.760]  outside of the federal courtroom. I said, I was the only one out there that would go right up to
[1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:45.840]  the media. I'm wide open talking to them, talking to them, answering their question.
[1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:51.840]  Look it up. None of them said one thing about me. They bashed Sidney Powell and Rudy, and then
[1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:56.560]  they said control. They are Mike. I've gone to press conferences too. I've been in front of
[1:37:56.560 --> 1:38:01.120]  a hundred cameras and none of them pick it up because it's all lockstep. You can be the event.
[1:38:01.120 --> 1:38:06.560]  You can be the hearing. They don't write a journalist talk to the man, the hearings about
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:11.040]  that shows they're not journalists. They're frauds. No, they are. They're all, you know,
[1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:16.080]  you either, what we've learned here, they're either terrible journalists or they're, or they're,
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:21.760]  or even if they do have some, I've said to them, the lady goes, this was a good one. ABC says to me,
[1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:27.920]  Mr. Lindell, if you're having this cyber symposium, why haven't you revealed your evidence
[1:38:27.920 --> 1:38:33.200]  that you have these site, these packet captures? Why didn't you reveal them before now? I go,
[1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:41.040]  hello. I said, I've sent it to all of you outlets, pieces of it, not one ever put the evidence up.
[1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:46.480]  And I said, I said, little lady, I said, I'll tell you what, even if you did, your boss would not
[1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:52.400]  let you do it. I mean, she, I mean, this is the way it is out there. And so I said, so now I got
[1:38:52.400 --> 1:38:57.840]  to bring it to the people. I got to bring it instead of trying to get the evidence out in pieces.
[1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:03.120]  Everybody knows I have it. We're going to have this symposium and everyone now everybody can get
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:08.560]  involved. We're going to have, we're going to have numbers, addresses and everything to call
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:14.640]  and write and every single congressman, senator to make sure that they're there. Yeah, Alec,
[1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:19.360]  for giving them a second chance that they didn't do their jobs in November and December,
[1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:23.600]  we're going to give them all a second chance that they can see. Here's the evidence. We're
[1:39:23.600 --> 1:39:28.800]  even going to give Bill Barr, we'll say, okay, you might not have known this back then because it
[1:39:28.800 --> 1:39:35.120]  came out January 9th. So, you know, but he just came out yesterday and said some, some crazy statement.
[1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:41.040]  He could have said, I wasn't, I didn't have that evidence on January 9th. I made my statement that
[1:39:41.040 --> 1:39:46.400]  there wasn't enough before that. Or all these legislatures that said there was nothing. Chris
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:51.920]  Krebs, it said it was the most secure election ever. Well, you get, you know what, Jim and Alan
[1:39:51.920 --> 1:39:58.400]  Schiff said a couple months ago, said the biggest attack, the biggest threat to our country is a
[1:39:58.400 --> 1:40:03.840]  cyber attack by China right down to the local races. So even they can say, you know what,
[1:40:04.560 --> 1:40:09.600]  we didn't know about this and you know, now we have it. And I want, I really want to state this
[1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:15.120]  to what a, what a packet capture is. I talked to a gal yesterday that, that she was part of the
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:22.560]  Wisconsin investigation outside of Milwaukee right after the election and they gave them the packet
[1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:28.480]  captures, the voter, the ballot images and the ballots. And they got them all and they said,
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:33.040]  look at all this. Well, then they said, they shut it down. They said, and they sent her to Georgia.
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:38.560]  She had the same problem there. All this, all this cover up. But here's what I said to her. I said,
[1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:45.040]  you had the ballot images and the packet captures. And she said, yeah. And I said, and she goes,
[1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:50.240]  then I told her about having all these packet captures. She said, that was one of the arguments.
[1:40:50.240 --> 1:40:56.000]  If you only had packet captures for let's say half of Wisconsin and you, and they showed all
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:01.200]  these slips from Trump to Biden. Well, now if I'm a lawyer, I'm going to say, well, you don't have
[1:41:01.200 --> 1:41:05.840]  the other packet captures for the election. So how do we know they didn't go buy into Trump?
[1:41:05.840 --> 1:41:11.920]  Well, guess what, everybody? We have every single packet capture for the whole election,
[1:41:11.920 --> 1:41:15.520]  for the whole United States. Let me ask you the $64 trillion question.
[1:41:15.520 --> 1:41:18.960]  All 50 states. Let me ask you the $64 trillion question.
[1:41:19.920 --> 1:41:27.920]  Are you able to say how you got this? Yes, these were, these were, I got introduced to a person
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:33.280]  because they couldn't get this out there. These guys tried, these were three heroes that captured
[1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:41.040]  it, captured these packet captures from the election. And you realize this is 37 terabytes
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:48.640]  of information, 1.2 billion lines of information. Now, all three of them, there's four different
[1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:53.840]  things to capture this. This is what our government should have been doing. Our government should
[1:41:53.840 --> 1:41:59.840]  have been. Well, Mike, let me just stop you because over a month ago, I met with one of the
[1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:03.600]  top talk shows in the country. I'm not going to say Limbaugh is dead. So it's not Limbaugh.
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:07.440]  So people can probably imagine who is the top talk show. So they can debate that all day. But
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:11.120]  there's a few guys that are as big as it gets. You know, and I guess I'm in that top five or
[1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:15.920]  whatever. But argue with the biggest talk shows in the country met with a major cybersecurity
[1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:21.920]  expert, a household name when it comes to that. And the guy said, Lindell is right. Trump is right.
[1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:27.040]  We monitored it in lifetime out of China. They stole the whole deal. So maybe I know one of
[1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:31.440]  the same people, but this person was asking me how to present this. And I said, I'm not an expert
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:35.920]  like this. And he can't get the guy to come on air because he's so scared. But this is a very
[1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:40.720]  prominent person met with one of the top experts in the country. And they said, no, we monitored it
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:45.520]  that night in lifetime. We'll come right back in the final segment with Mike Lindell of my
[1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:50.640]  pillow.com. Hey, we should all grow people like Mike Lindell, courage, perseverance, not backing
[1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:57.520]  down against the tax. A true American hero. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[1:43:52.240 --> 1:43:59.520]  The fourth of July Super Sale starts now at infowarstore.com. Again, I don't like to lecture
[1:43:59.520 --> 1:44:03.760]  people. I'm a very private person, but because of the globalist, their attack on humanity,
[1:44:03.760 --> 1:44:08.320]  I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure. And we've given the globalist one hell
[1:44:08.320 --> 1:44:13.200]  of a run for their money because of God. And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk
[1:44:13.200 --> 1:44:17.280]  about God all day, but just give me a break. The Satanism's out the open. I've always been a Christian,
[1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:22.240]  but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear. And I get it. While you've
[1:44:22.240 --> 1:44:27.760]  been turned off by big churches, while you've been turned off by the corrupt priest class system,
[1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:33.520]  and I get it, me too. Believe me, I'm one of them. But it's that relationship with God and just God's
[1:44:34.160 --> 1:44:39.760]  universe that God created that is so essential. And God created the universe for us to have
[1:44:39.760 --> 1:44:44.160]  communion with God through and to have life. And so that's what info wars is really all about. So
[1:44:44.160 --> 1:44:47.840]  thank you all for your word of mouth. Thank you for spreading the word about info wars. And thank
[1:44:47.840 --> 1:44:52.640]  you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting infowarstore.com. Because without your
[1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:56.320]  daily and weekly and monthly purchases, we'll be taken off the air. So thank you for the support
[1:44:56.320 --> 1:45:04.080]  infowarstore.com. The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic and
[1:45:04.080 --> 1:45:09.360]  making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as
[1:45:09.360 --> 1:45:14.560]  being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:21.360]  Being given free will being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:26.480]  an entire system. And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact you're able to see
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:31.120]  the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your life,
[1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:36.160]  your husband, the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that
[1:45:36.160 --> 1:45:42.640]  you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic. And that itself is what God teaches
[1:45:42.640 --> 1:45:48.160]  us is worship. So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of
[1:45:48.160 --> 1:45:54.000]  the system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God. And appreciate your consciousness
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:57.520]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[1:45:57.520 --> 1:46:05.120]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:39.120]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[1:46:57.520 --> 1:47:09.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:27.520 --> 1:47:36.720]  So no taking lying down.
[1:47:40.960 --> 1:47:44.320]  And Mike Lindell is not taking it lying down.
[1:47:47.680 --> 1:47:54.000]  The left points at him and says, look at him under attack. He's a loser. No. Winners are under
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:59.920]  attack. Freedom's under attack. And our forebears stood up for freedom. We live on their shoulders
[1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:06.160]  from their work they did and that gas tank's running low. So to see the sea of people lay down
[1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:10.960]  to evil and to see Mike Lindell and President Trump fighting back and we're fighting back,
[1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:16.720]  it is very, very exciting. You know, Trump's more awake now than ever. We get him back in there.
[1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:22.720]  We get him to lead a Republican Party regardless we win. So Mike Lindell, separately, people
[1:48:22.720 --> 1:48:26.640]  need to support what you're doing. Your products are great. They're amazing. I know you told me
[1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:31.120]  if this a few weeks ago when you were on and we were so busy, I didn't get to it. But if people
[1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:38.720]  go to mypillow.com, you have amazing sheets, towels, not just pillows. You've got your amazing
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:46.000]  towel pack that's what $109 for $39.95 with promo code Alex. You're barely bringing any money there.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:50.480]  People should purchase it there to fund what you're doing. They should help buy it $109,
[1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:58.560]  but $39.95. That's a huge discount by you and I'm told all of their products up to 66% off
[1:48:58.560 --> 1:49:06.000]  with promo code Alex. So promo code A-L-E-X at mypillow.com and I'm just super excited
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:10.400]  to tell my listeners to go support you and get great products because if they don't fund this
[1:49:10.400 --> 1:49:16.080]  war effort, if they don't back us up and pray for us and spread the word and support us financially,
[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:21.280]  the globalists are going to win. So again, people got to put fuel in your tank. You are
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:26.720]  taking the globalists on toe to toe and if we don't energize you, well, then we deserve to lose.
[1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:30.800]  So tell folks about these amazing towels. I don't even want to do this today, but
[1:49:30.800 --> 1:49:35.200]  yeah, you sent this to me. Tell us about the towels, the sheets, all the products.
[1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:40.400]  Well, the towels are the best towels in history. They actually dry you. They don't,
[1:49:40.400 --> 1:49:44.640]  they don't feel like the ones that stores like all lotion. They work. These are the towels you've
[1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:51.040]  seen on TV, the best towels ever, with me with our Southern U.S. cotton too. And they're normally
[1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:57.760]  199 or 199. I am doing this for this show coming on. So it's only, this one's only going to be
[1:49:57.760 --> 1:50:04.320]  like a 24-hour special for $39.99 with promo code Alex. And then all the other products,
[1:50:04.320 --> 1:50:11.280]  our sheets are on sale right now, the Mikeisa sheets, but you have 110 products. That's one
[1:50:11.280 --> 1:50:16.000]  thing we've been able to, you know, diversify with all the other products during this attack.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:21.520]  And I want to thank each and every person out there. We've lost all our box stores, except for
[1:50:21.520 --> 1:50:29.440]  maybe two, and all our, all the shopping channels, the UBCs, the HSNs, all them cowards out there
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:36.320]  that succumb to the, to the cancel culture. But my employees, I have 2,500 employees,
[1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:40.480]  they thank each and every one of you. And that is how I've been able to stay supportive.
[1:50:40.480 --> 1:50:45.760]  I haven't reached out for anybody's help. I've been, a lot of my employees have stocks,
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:53.360]  so I have a little over 50% of my pillow, but I'm using my money to fight this, this election.
[1:50:53.360 --> 1:50:58.000]  And I can't explain how, I mean, this is like, it's a wonderful life. I mean, literally a Jimmy
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:03.680]  Stewart story. You are standing up, I'm in the same boat as you at a lower level, but we're like,
[1:51:03.680 --> 1:51:08.720]  they've taken our banks away, our suppliers, the harassment, going back to talk to my
[1:51:08.720 --> 1:51:13.120]  junior high teacher, same thing. And it's okay. I just don't want to lose.
[1:51:13.120 --> 1:51:18.880]  I don't mind being attacked. I just don't want to lose. It's literally listeners buying products
[1:51:18.880 --> 1:51:24.080]  at infowarstore.com or buyingproductsatmybillow.com that people understand we need that money.
[1:51:24.080 --> 1:51:29.280]  We are maxed out and it's a war plus. These are great products. So what a huge deal you're offering.
[1:51:29.280 --> 1:51:33.760]  People should not wait. They should take advantage of it. Tell people more about some of these products.
[1:51:33.760 --> 1:51:40.080]  Yeah, you've got the Giza dream sheets and you've got there are two for one low price
[1:51:40.080 --> 1:51:45.680]  with pre shipping. We've got a, we've got our pillow, the premium pillow. I put that on sale too.
[1:51:45.680 --> 1:51:51.360]  I passed all the savings right on to you. So I think they're normally $69.99, the queen size
[1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:57.040]  for $29.99. All of these are the lowest prices, the two that that's all this and the pillow,
[1:51:57.040 --> 1:52:04.720]  the lowest price I've ever had in history. And they are like crappy ones are $200. Yeah.
[1:52:04.720 --> 1:52:09.520]  And we've got we've got also we've got bathrobes. We've got these slippers that I
[1:52:09.520 --> 1:52:14.640]  these took over a year to invent these slippers. They're made with one of the piece of them is
[1:52:14.640 --> 1:52:19.120]  impact shell which made from us soybean. These are the most you walk around all day. You feel
[1:52:19.120 --> 1:52:23.760]  like you just have shoes on rather than slippery. What I love is you're not bowing down. You're
[1:52:23.760 --> 1:52:28.560]  overcoming them and you're reaching out to folks saying, I'll fight for your election. I won't
[1:52:28.560 --> 1:52:35.200]  back down, but I need your support. My pillow.com promo code Alex biggest sales ever. I know about
[1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:39.040]  your promo codes. These are your biggest, biggest promo code ever. So I'm very honored you're doing
[1:52:39.040 --> 1:52:44.880]  this, Mike. Well, thank you. And one more thing we did. I just put out my bed commercial, the
[1:52:44.880 --> 1:52:50.800]  infomercial that was just now three weeks ago, brand new, the best bed you will ever buy a combination
[1:52:50.800 --> 1:52:56.160]  of coil and springs that took me two years to develop. When I develop things, I go problem
[1:52:56.160 --> 1:53:01.840]  solution, solve the problem and come out is like reverse engineer, what a product should be. So
[1:53:01.840 --> 1:53:06.240]  and that's kind of what we're doing here with this election, everybody. I've just it's a big
[1:53:06.240 --> 1:53:12.800]  marketing thing right now to get this fall down. I've had a royal flush since January 9th, a royal
[1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:18.800]  flush of evidence. I have every packet capture for the whole election. And you asked me before
[1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:22.560]  Alex, can you say where you got it? It doesn't matter where I got it. But yeah, when this gets
[1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:27.680]  to the Supreme Court, it'll all be revealed. But with a packet capture, it doesn't matter where
[1:53:27.680 --> 1:53:32.000]  you got it. I know they're legitimately scared. And I talked to one of the top talk shows the
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:37.680]  country who met with people at MIT and they said it's real. Yeah, yeah, it is real. So you guys,
[1:53:37.680 --> 1:53:44.720]  though, the whole win here is just to get this, this everybody to the cyber symposium, all the
[1:53:44.720 --> 1:53:50.640]  politicians and the fact checkers and all these people there, Democrats, Republicans alike, get
[1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:55.280]  them all there. And I want to tell you this too, we even have it further on, I want to tell what
[1:53:55.280 --> 1:53:58.960]  we're going to do with this symposium, I didn't get to say this before I'm going to tell it. Now,
[1:53:58.960 --> 1:54:03.840]  we're going to have another room, I'm going to be emcee in that room. In that room, we're going to
[1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:08.720]  do a continual mock election, where we have we have by the way, we have every kind of machine,
[1:54:08.720 --> 1:54:14.080]  we have dominion, smart, and as far we're going to line them up like Ford would. And all these
[1:54:14.080 --> 1:54:18.640]  senators and come through in a mock election, they don't get to vote. And then we're going to have
[1:54:18.640 --> 1:54:23.760]  like an attorney general go, okay, write down how many votes you would like to flip, give it to
[1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:29.360]  the hacker, he hacks in and flips it, comes out the other end, you're going to go, what? This is,
[1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:36.000]  you know, but here's the key, this is really important. Now, not even in that area, we're
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:41.440]  going to have the guys out capturing these packets, like they did during the election,
[1:54:41.440 --> 1:54:47.120]  or like you can capture in any internet bit or information that's going back and forth,
[1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:51.920]  they're going to capture that packet capture, and they're going to come back, then we come
[1:54:51.920 --> 1:55:00.480]  into the room and they go, okay, yet at 1103, you you flip 50 votes, and it came from a machine
[1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:05.520]  with the serial number, the idea of the computer and everything. So everyone's going to understand
[1:55:05.520 --> 1:55:11.520]  cyber forensics by the time we get done with this three day event. And I will tell you this,
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:16.800]  it's just like a picture you that you would take in like 1975, let's say you and I Alex
[1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:22.160]  were out in front of Mount Rushmore, and we took a picture pictures back then you couldn't alter,
[1:55:22.160 --> 1:55:27.600]  you could not alter them. Well, with with DNA blood, you can't alter that either, but you
[1:55:27.600 --> 1:55:33.280]  could maybe you could add to it or you could you could you could make it, you know, you could maybe
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:40.080]  add to it or paint it or whatever. But over here, with a packet capture, you can't change it, it
[1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:45.280]  is what it is, it's forever captured as long as you captured it, you can't change it, you can't
[1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:51.520]  alter it. I have talked to now, probably 50 forensic experts, if I meet one that knows anything
[1:55:51.520 --> 1:55:56.480]  about it, I say, if you have a packet capture, what would you have? And they say you have everything.
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:00.160]  And I've asked, they said, what if you had every packet capture of the whole election?
[1:56:00.160 --> 1:56:06.480]  They'd say, ha, you know, it's 100%. It's non subjective. Well, my guess is that the system
[1:56:06.480 --> 1:56:10.640]  is scared, and it's coming out that they destroyed the computers destroyed the evidence.
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:16.720]  Georgia's having to admit fraud. They they're now trying to say, look at this national strategy
[1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:22.160]  for counter domestic terrorism put out a week ago by Biden, and actually says right here,
[1:56:22.160 --> 1:56:26.000]  questioning elections, look at this for TV viewers, I want to close with this,
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:32.800]  questioning narratives of fraud in the recent general election is an act of terrorism. Well,
[1:56:32.800 --> 1:56:37.120]  that's illegal. Whether we're right or wrong, we are right. This tells us they're scared,
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:42.880]  they're the bad guys. That's right. I want to say one more thing to everybody. We've got an
[1:56:42.880 --> 1:56:48.880]  alternative system to get rid of these machines. If I'll say if the worst thing that would ever
[1:56:48.880 --> 1:56:54.000]  happen that this wouldn't get pulled down, the one thing there will not be one machine left in
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:57:00.080]  the United States or in the world that we have an alternate system that's 100% accurate and you
[1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:05.120]  can and there's no hacking and you can even see my you got to join us again this week. We love you.
