[00:00.000 --> 00:29.920]  Infowars, the most banned nest.
[00:29.920 --> 00:39.920]  There are several different definitions of symbiotic relationships, but they're all basically the same.
[00:39.920 --> 00:53.920]  Two or more species who live within a close proximity of each other and both of those species' life cycles and activities contribute to the others.
[00:53.920 --> 00:59.920]  And so they live in a symbiotic relationship, they're linked up.
[00:59.920 --> 01:16.920]  Now, if we pull back and we look at what Hollywood's doing, what the universities are doing, not just here, but all over the world, there is a unified effort to sabotage the family, to sabotage culture, to get people into debt, to make people ill, to make them sick.
[01:16.920 --> 01:35.920]  I mean, it's all out in the open now. Only a few countries like Russia are actively opposing that and saying, hey, too many vaccines are dangerous and, hey, GMO really is sterilizing people and, hey, don't try to break up families, don't try to sexualize children when they're in the elementary school, that's evil.
[01:35.920 --> 01:46.920]  And Russia has come out and pointed out that Hollywood and the EU and others are actually trying to poison society and destabilize it.
[01:46.920 --> 02:03.920]  Now, we don't need the Russians to tell us that, to know it's true, we can see it every day, but we're always hearing that, oh, the Russians are behind Trump and the Russians are behind the fight against the EU and the Russians are behind the nationalists in Brazil.
[02:03.920 --> 02:16.920]  Well, no, not the Russians themselves, but the spirit of not wanting to be slaves, the spirit of wanting to have strong families, the spirit of wanting to have a good future, the spirit of wanting to build a civilization that's good and wholesome.
[02:16.920 --> 02:24.920]  Yes, that spirit, that same spirit behind the Russians and their rebirth, compared to where they were, is driving us.
[02:24.920 --> 02:34.920]  The Russians hit rock bottom after 70-plus years of leftist torture and enslavement, and so they've seen the face of the technocracy.
[02:34.920 --> 02:51.920]  We here haven't hit bottom yet, and there's different ways to learn, you know, you can learn from experience, you can learn by being warned, being educated, and you can also, of course, learn by revelation.
[02:51.920 --> 02:59.920]  Revelation would be the best way, wouldn't it? From your own instincts, your own spirit, your own understanding, and just follow what you know is right, that voice is never wrong.
[02:59.920 --> 03:10.920]  But we can live by experience and by education, by experiencing globalism in the New World Order, and all the poison, and all the curses, and all the bad things that come with it.
[03:10.920 --> 03:25.920]  And we can read and learn from people like Alexander Silsenitsyn, what they went through, and say, let's not do this again. But to be able to do that, we're going to need to get aggressive, and not see fighting tyranny as work,
[03:25.920 --> 03:34.920]  but see it as breathing air into our lungs when we climb a hill. And the more we do it, the stronger we get, and it becomes a compulsion to fight tyranny.
[03:34.920 --> 03:41.920]  It becomes an enjoyment to fight tyranny. Better than food, better than sex, is fighting for our very survival.
[03:41.920 --> 03:52.920]  Because if we don't fight for our territory, and fight for our human will, and fight for justice, and fight for our children, but all the food, and the sex, and all the things God's given us to enjoy our lives with our husbands and wives won't mean anything.
[03:52.920 --> 03:58.920]  But you'd notice they're trying to take our food, and they're trying to take our sex away, our normal natural men and women.
[03:58.920 --> 04:11.920]  Because all of that is holy. What does holy mean? It just means sacred? It just means what's good, what was meant from the beginning, what works, what connects us to all those that came before us.
[04:11.920 --> 04:22.920]  It's not human culture, men and women, and families. It's survival. It's who we are. Forged in the fires, and the frozen waste, and the wars.
[04:22.920 --> 04:33.920]  And all we've been through, all of us are the inheritors of that majesty, and this incredible experience together, and we're not going to let our species down, and I know you aren't.
[04:33.920 --> 04:43.920]  So spread the word about this broadcast however you can, and buy those products that are great for you and your family, that are symbiotic, and together, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to march to the future.
[04:43.920 --> 04:54.920]  We're going to fight this dehumanizing force, this tester, and we're going to win with God's grace, because God is good and evil will fall and fail, but it must be given.
[04:54.920 --> 04:59.920]  It's one hour to test us, and the test is now.
[04:59.920 --> 05:11.920]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[05:11.920 --> 05:20.920]  How far will they go? What's their limit? And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[05:20.920 --> 05:26.920]  The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit.
[05:26.920 --> 05:35.920]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist, or that there's no free will, there's no devil, or the God.
[05:35.920 --> 05:45.920]  The very same people have all these rules for us about speech, and how we can dress, and where we can live, and what our houses can be like.
[05:45.920 --> 05:49.920]  They just don't want us to have any values, so they can run over us.
[05:49.920 --> 05:51.920]  Oxford's banned clapping.
[05:51.920 --> 06:09.920]  The University of the US has banned 21 gun salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders, and it's time to reject them.
[06:09.920 --> 06:26.920]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:26.920 --> 06:40.920]  London Bridge terror stabbing. Suspect shot dead. Police was wearing hoax bombs. Guardian London Bridge police shoot stabbing. Suspect after five injured. And of course, last time the lion of London Bridge fought back when they'd already killed a bunch of people.
[06:40.920 --> 06:46.920]  He was taken for re-education for daring fight back against the jihadis. I'm not joking.
[06:46.920 --> 06:56.920]  He tackled the man. He stabbed somebody they're reporting nearby London Bridge, so it sounds like he went into some kind of shop or premises and tried to stab a bunch of people.
[06:56.920 --> 07:06.920]  And was immediately tackled by a bunch of brave citizens who grabbed the knife from him, and he was wearing what they now call a fake explosives vest.
[07:06.920 --> 07:16.920]  It was fake at the time, obviously. So they got the knife off him, then the police arrived, got the public to stand back and basically double tapped him in the head and shot him dead.
[07:16.920 --> 07:28.920]  Which has caused some consternation over quite a few people on Twitter, Alex, who said that the terrorist should not have been killed and that he should have been arrested or handcuffed,
[07:28.920 --> 07:39.920]  given that he just stabbed, they're saying, I guess, at least five people at the moment. He was wearing a fake explosives vest. They're saying he should have been arrested, apprehended without deadly force.
[07:39.920 --> 07:51.920]  Which is interesting because we've got an election coming up here in about 10 days time where the leader of one side of the parties that are running, the two major parties, Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party,
[07:51.920 --> 08:02.920]  also said back, I think it was last month, correct, when Baghdadi was killed, that Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, should not have been killed and should have been arrested.
[08:02.920 --> 08:14.920]  I have to say that I do not think it realistic to suggest that he could be just apprehended when you look at the threats that this country faces,
[08:14.920 --> 08:24.920]  that we are realistic about what we must do to be strong in the face of those threats. And I must say, I think that if you're correct in what you say, which I'm sure you are,
[08:24.920 --> 08:33.920]  about what Jeremy Corbyn had to say, I think his approach is naive and it's naive to the point of being dangerous.
[08:33.920 --> 08:38.920]  So that kind of rhetoric is now being mirrored in the aftermath of this terrorist attack in London.
[08:38.920 --> 08:43.920]  What was the exact term? They called him what, an austere scholar, a great leader?
[08:43.920 --> 08:48.920]  Oh yeah, immediately after he was killed, the Washington Post reported that he was an austere scholar.
[08:48.920 --> 08:54.920]  Here's an example of some of what I picked up on Twitter. And these people are all Jeremy Corbyn supporters, obviously.
[08:54.920 --> 09:02.920]  One person said, well done to the public and the police on a fast response on London Bridge, but was there any need for the police to kill the man?
[09:02.920 --> 09:08.920]  They could have easily arrested him, but murdered him instead. State murder doesn't sit well with me.
[09:08.920 --> 09:17.920]  He'd literally just been running around foaming at the mouth. He'd ran into premises, police rushed to the scene, passed us by, grabbed the man, pinned him to the ground.
[09:17.920 --> 09:23.920]  He had a giant, what they call, zombie knife. But no, he shouldn't have been shot apparently, Alex.
[09:23.920 --> 09:29.920]  That was too much deadly force and he should have merely been arrested. So this is the narrative that we're dealing with.
[09:29.920 --> 09:39.920]  The other aspect of this is, as you said, the guy who tackled the London Bridge terrorists on the previous attack, which was more deadly two years ago,
[09:39.920 --> 09:45.920]  he was later put in a right-wing extremist database. So you have that tie in as well.
[09:45.920 --> 09:56.920]  He's also sent to reeducation classes. And again, how many people died? How many times was he brutally stabbed as he took on the two individuals with huge knives
[09:56.920 --> 10:02.920]  that were running around stabbing people, screaming, Allah Akbar. And again, we have the footage. The man is going for a suicide vest.
[10:02.920 --> 10:08.920]  They didn't know what it was. They told him over and over again to stop. You see the officer get in the position and kill him.
[10:08.920 --> 10:12.920]  Should have shot him before that when he had his hands on what looked like a suicide vest.
[10:12.920 --> 10:15.920]  Was saying he was going to detonate it. Obviously, he wanted suicide.
[10:15.920 --> 10:27.920]  I cop had just reportedly stabbed a bunch of people. What the hell planet are these leftist living on lionizing people like this comeback?
[10:27.920 --> 10:30.920]  Do I think Thanksgiving is an offensive holiday? Yes.
[10:30.920 --> 10:38.920]  It's a holiday that's commemorating the genocide of Native people. We still deal with the scars of this today.
[10:38.920 --> 10:44.920]  It wasn't our land to take. We took it. We're celebrating that we took it from other people who lived there first.
[10:44.920 --> 10:47.920]  I think it's not nice. Is that what Thanksgiving is about? Yeah.
[10:47.920 --> 10:56.920]  The idea of celebrating, it just glorifies the smallpox blankets and other things we did to just completely eradicate the Native Americans.
[10:56.920 --> 11:07.920]  I think we should, like you said, rename it. What would you choose to rename it? Food and Family Day.
[11:07.920 --> 11:16.920]  Blue check mark liberals on Twitter have been saying Thanksgiving is offensive. You shouldn't celebrate it while we're here at Rutgers University to see if the student body agrees with that.
[11:16.920 --> 11:17.920]  Let's see what they think.
[11:28.920 --> 11:32.920]  I just noticed your shirt and wanted to get your opinion about something. Oh, sure. OK.
[11:32.920 --> 11:38.920]  Real quick. Do you think Thanksgiving is an offensive holiday to celebrate? I think that it's not intended to be offensive.
[11:38.920 --> 11:45.920]  But if you know the story it is, and I think what's more offensive is the fact that we teach little kids in schools like a surface level story that isn't true.
[11:45.920 --> 11:50.920]  That I think is so much more offensive to, I'm not Native American, but if I was, I would be really offended.
[11:50.920 --> 11:57.920]  Why? It's not my job to speak for Native American people, but I would rather not offend anybody because there's no risk, you know what I'm saying?
[11:57.920 --> 11:59.920]  To just reject it.
[11:59.920 --> 12:03.920]  So maybe not to offend people we should reject Thanksgiving?
[12:03.920 --> 12:11.920]  Not as, OK, I phrased it badly, but at least not teach little kids that the pilgrims and Native Americans were best friends and treated each other well, because that's not what happened.
[12:11.920 --> 12:12.920]  Can you show the camera your shirt?
[12:12.920 --> 12:22.920]  Cool. Yeah, this is from the Pride Parade last summer, June 30th. It was the anniversary of the Seminole riots, and it was an epic parade.
[12:22.920 --> 12:24.920]  Epic? OK.
[12:24.920 --> 12:35.920]  I'm sure it was. Do you think Thanksgiving and all of its history and what it started as, do you think we should be celebrating it based on its history?
[12:35.920 --> 12:47.920]  I think that Thanksgiving is currently an institution in American culture, and I think that its immediate effects are nice and good.
[12:47.920 --> 13:03.920]  But I also think that every time that we have it, we should always consider the fact that the Native Americans are people that we have kind of misrepresented as being OK with it or being happy about it during this time and our holidays.
[13:03.920 --> 13:06.920]  So you don't think that Native Americans are OK with it?
[13:06.920 --> 13:09.920]  I think that they're probably not OK with how it's been represented.
[13:09.920 --> 13:13.920]  Do you think Thanksgiving is an offensive holiday to celebrate?
[13:13.920 --> 13:18.920]  No. I myself am part Native American.
[13:18.920 --> 13:19.920]  Oh, OK.
[13:19.920 --> 13:21.920]  So I don't really think it's that offensive to celebrate it.
[13:21.920 --> 13:23.920]  Do I think Thanksgiving is an offensive holiday?
[13:23.920 --> 13:24.920]  Yes.
[13:24.920 --> 13:25.920]  Can you tell me why?
[13:25.920 --> 13:28.920]  Well, it celebrates the, can you hear me?
[13:28.920 --> 13:29.920]  Wait, can you?
[13:29.920 --> 13:31.920]  I'll call you back in a sec.
[13:31.920 --> 13:44.920]  It celebrates, like, colonizer, like, holidays. I think, like, the idea of celebrating, it just, like, glorifies the, like, smallpox blankets and other things we did to, like, just completely eradicate the Native Americans.
[13:44.920 --> 13:47.920]  You think pilgrims did that that came over?
[13:47.920 --> 13:53.920]  Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm sure it wasn't all of them, but, like, as a whole, yeah, the, like, colonizer attitude did that.
[13:53.920 --> 14:10.920]  All holidays, like, this stuff, like, this is very nuanced. Like, you got to, as long as you acknowledge, like, that, like, that there has been a lot of oppression of Native Americans in this country, and that, I mean, basically, like, ethnic cleansing of tons of people, that doesn't eliminate the fact that you could celebrate Thanksgiving.
[14:10.920 --> 14:18.920]  Yeah. I mean, clearly it's offensive. I think that, over time, like, it does have a different connotation now. It's more about, like, seeing your family and things like that.
[14:18.920 --> 14:24.920]  But the inception of it is, like, inherently problematic, because it was the genocide of Indigenous people, and we can't change that.
[14:24.920 --> 14:29.920]  Like, people were slaughtered. There was an entire population of here that just doesn't exist anymore.
[14:29.920 --> 14:31.920]  Because of...
[14:31.920 --> 14:33.920]  Because of European colonizers.
[14:33.920 --> 14:36.920]  Specifically, the pilgrims that came over on the Mayflower?
[14:36.920 --> 14:42.920]  The pilgrims, but also, like, the Spanish colonizers that came with Columbus, like, first of all.
[14:42.920 --> 14:49.920]  Um, Dana, yeah, she thinks it is. I don't think it is.
[14:49.920 --> 14:51.920]  Why is it offensive? Can I have her tell me?
[14:51.920 --> 14:53.920]  Dana?
[14:53.920 --> 14:57.920]  She said it's all about killing Native Americans.
[14:57.920 --> 15:03.920]  I really love eating turkey ass, so, like, I wouldn't say so.
[15:03.920 --> 15:08.920]  But, like, it kind of is, but, like, at the same time, like, who doesn't like eating turkey?
[15:08.920 --> 15:10.920]  You said turkey ass.
[15:10.920 --> 15:12.920]  No.
[15:12.920 --> 15:16.920]  I want to make it clear. He said turkey ass, not just turkey.
[15:16.920 --> 15:18.920]  Is there any other type of ass?
[15:18.920 --> 15:20.920]  Do I think Thanksgiving is an offensive holiday?
[15:20.920 --> 15:21.920]  Yes.
[15:21.920 --> 15:24.920]  It's a holiday that's commemorating the genocide of Native people.
[15:24.920 --> 15:28.920]  Um, we still deal with the scars of this today.
[15:28.920 --> 15:30.920]  It wasn't our land to take.
[15:30.920 --> 15:34.920]  We took it, and we're celebrating that we took it from other people who lived there first.
[15:34.920 --> 15:36.920]  And I think it's not nice.
[15:36.920 --> 15:37.920]  Is that what Thanksgiving is about?
[15:37.920 --> 15:38.920]  Yeah.
[15:38.920 --> 15:43.920]  The idea of celebrating, um, it just, like, glorifies the, like, smallpox blankets
[15:43.920 --> 15:47.920]  and other things we did to, like, just completely eradicate the Native Americans.
[15:47.920 --> 15:49.920]  I think we should, like you said, like, rename it.
[15:49.920 --> 15:52.920]  What would you choose to rename it?
[15:52.920 --> 15:57.920]  Food and Family Day.
[15:57.920 --> 16:01.920]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[16:01.920 --> 16:06.920]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally

[17:05.920 --> 17:08.920]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[17:08.920 --> 17:09.920]  Bill Hyde here.
[17:09.920 --> 17:13.920]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system
[17:13.920 --> 17:17.920]  that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[17:17.920 --> 17:22.920]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[17:22.920 --> 17:27.920]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[17:27.920 --> 17:32.920]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[17:32.920 --> 17:34.920]  if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:34.920 --> 17:36.920]  So here's what you should do right now.

[18:07.920 --> 18:09.920]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[18:09.920 --> 18:12.920]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air
[18:12.920 --> 18:17.920]  and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres.
[18:17.920 --> 18:24.920]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[18:24.920 --> 18:29.920]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration.
[18:29.920 --> 18:33.920]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[18:33.920 --> 18:39.920]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[18:39.920 --> 18:43.920]  So it's not a burden to support info wars.
[18:43.920 --> 18:54.920]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.

[19:53.920 --> 19:57.920]  Only this black Friday at infowarstore.com.
[19:57.920 --> 19:58.920]  Fear of missing out is a serious condition.
[19:58.920 --> 20:24.920]  It can only be true.
[20:29.920 --> 20:32.920]  As we careen through the month of yet more impeachment hearings.
[20:32.920 --> 20:43.920]  Now the House Judiciary Committee and House Democrats have given the White House an opportunity to participate in its first hearing in this next phase of the impeachment inquiry and the White House is turning it down.
[20:43.920 --> 20:54.920]  So basically all that Nadler is asking is are you going to play along with our completely biased and manipulated rules and the specific privileges we give you that you have to play along with that.
[20:54.920 --> 20:59.920]  And we're going to lie, cheat and steal along the way or are you going to decline to participate entirely?
[20:59.920 --> 21:03.920]  And then we can say, oh, hey, that's your fault, President Trump, for not participating.
[21:03.920 --> 21:18.920]  I mean, imagine, Ed, if this were a courtroom and the respondents only options were to come in and have a completely biased, arbitrary hearing or decline to participate completely and then have the judge just say, well, it's your fault.
[21:18.920 --> 21:19.920]  You didn't participate.
[21:19.920 --> 21:20.920]  So we're making a finding of guilt.
[21:20.920 --> 21:28.920]  Trump may or may not, we don't really know that evidence suggests he didn't think about delaying aid and that aid was delayed, but it wasn't cut off.
[21:28.920 --> 21:31.920]  Maybe he thought about cutting it off, but that's not a crime.
[21:31.920 --> 21:35.920]  Continue to decipher the madness of the mouthpieces of globalism.
[21:35.920 --> 21:53.920]  I got a lot of, I got hairy legs that turned, that turned blonde in the sun and the kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg down so it was straight and then watch the hair come back up again.
[21:53.920 --> 21:54.920]  They look at it.
[21:54.920 --> 21:55.920]  So I learned about roaches.
[21:55.920 --> 22:00.920]  I learned about kids jumping on my lap and I've loved kids jumping on my lap.
[22:00.920 --> 22:04.920]  I've been able to live that there is no objection to the留言.
[22:04.920 --> 22:20.920]  The marking bird media continues its treasonous propaganda campaign, ignoring the unsung efforts of the Trump administration to restore and protect the American Republic and its national security.
[22:20.920 --> 22:22.760]  and its national security.
[22:22.760 --> 22:25.100]  It was 14 days ago, the Southern Poverty Law Center
[22:25.100 --> 22:27.560]  published an expose of hundreds of emails
[22:27.560 --> 22:29.520]  of White House adviser Stephen Miller,
[22:29.520 --> 22:32.800]  trafficking in the ugliest scary types of immigrants
[22:32.800 --> 22:34.640]  and white nationalist websites and themes.
[22:34.640 --> 22:37.000]  This is before he actually went to the White House.
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.800]  And that man is the president's chief advisor
[22:39.800 --> 22:41.940]  in immigration who, according to NBC News Reporting,
[22:41.940 --> 22:44.100]  has long believed that, for instance,
[22:44.100 --> 22:46.540]  asylum officers are soft.
[22:46.540 --> 22:50.320]  For example, when it comes to the apocalyptic disaster
[22:50.320 --> 22:53.080]  across our southern border, President Trump
[22:53.080 --> 22:55.820]  has stated the obvious, yet bold.
[22:55.820 --> 22:58.900]  Donald Trump says he wants to put Mexican drug lords
[22:58.900 --> 23:01.300]  on the U.S. terrorist.
[23:01.300 --> 23:03.660]  It is a very, very sad situation.
[23:03.660 --> 23:05.300]  So you are going to designate the...
[23:05.300 --> 23:06.500]  I'm not even going to have to do that.
[23:06.500 --> 23:08.400]  You're going to designate the Mexican Contributors
[23:08.400 --> 23:09.400]  as terror groups?
[23:09.400 --> 23:11.400]  I am going to be designating the Contributors, absolutely.
[23:11.400 --> 23:13.580]  Mexico's president responded.
[23:13.580 --> 23:16.540]  In my case, I do not want to turn this into a controversy
[23:16.540 --> 23:18.580]  today nor tomorrow.
[23:18.580 --> 23:20.420]  I will only say cooperation.
[23:20.420 --> 23:22.580]  Yes. Intervention. No.
[23:22.580 --> 23:23.580]  Sí.
[23:26.160 --> 23:28.660]  Intervencionismo. No.
[23:28.660 --> 23:32.100]  The Mexican president instructed foreign minister
[23:32.100 --> 23:34.760]  Marcelo Ebrard to follow up on this matter.
[23:34.760 --> 23:36.540]  Ebrard quickly requested a meeting
[23:36.540 --> 23:39.240]  with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,
[23:39.240 --> 23:41.540]  hoping to gain understanding of the scope
[23:41.540 --> 23:43.740]  and meaning of Trump's statement.
[23:43.740 --> 23:45.440]  Meanwhile, under President Trump,
[23:45.440 --> 23:47.380]  the arrests on our side of the border
[23:47.380 --> 23:48.640]  continue to rack up.
[23:48.640 --> 23:53.420]  We have sent thousands and thousands and thousands
[23:53.420 --> 23:58.580]  of MS-13 horrible people out of this country
[23:58.580 --> 24:00.620]  or into our prisons.
[24:00.620 --> 24:03.920]  Many would argue that these practices are unfair,
[24:03.920 --> 24:06.600]  yet the time for half measures is over.
[24:06.600 --> 24:10.060]  Keep in mind that in the past, in different municipalities,
[24:10.060 --> 24:12.640]  there have been police officers that have been assassinated
[24:12.640 --> 24:14.400]  with two officers in a car.
[24:14.400 --> 24:17.780]  And the globalists have shown even the most ill-informed
[24:17.780 --> 24:18.740]  their hand.
[24:18.740 --> 24:23.080]  How did you kill Jeffrey Epstein?
[24:23.080 --> 24:31.580]  Because you're not in power, but you have all the power.
[24:31.580 --> 24:35.700]  As the roller coaster that will be 2020 draws near,
[24:35.700 --> 24:38.160]  it stands to rival those rare turning
[24:38.160 --> 24:40.160]  points in American history.
[24:40.160 --> 24:44.660]  And they're pushing that impeachment, witch hunt,
[24:44.660 --> 24:48.040]  and a lot of bad things are happening to them.
[24:48.040 --> 24:50.640]  Because you see what's happening in the polls?
[24:50.640 --> 24:54.780]  Everybody said, that's really bullsh----.
[24:54.780 --> 24:55.780]  John Dunn.
[24:58.980 --> 25:03.320]  On Friday, November 15, protests broke out in Iran
[25:03.320 --> 25:07.660]  when the regime raised fuel prices by 50%.
[25:07.660 --> 25:11.020]  Immediately following, the government began shutting down
[25:11.020 --> 25:12.920]  the internet.
[25:12.920 --> 25:16.120]  Within 24 hours, practically the entire internet
[25:16.120 --> 25:20.500]  was shut down, including Iran's mobile networks,
[25:20.500 --> 25:23.640]  leaving the majority of the country disconnected
[25:23.640 --> 25:26.340]  and isolated from the world.
[25:26.340 --> 25:29.240]  During the internet blackout, the Iranian people
[25:29.240 --> 25:32.140]  were encouraged through state-controlled media
[25:32.140 --> 25:35.880]  to join in the protests, while also being warned
[25:35.880 --> 25:38.620]  that they will be arrested.
[25:38.620 --> 25:42.180]  Rouhani said that people have the right to protest,
[25:42.180 --> 25:45.660]  but they are not the same as people who rebel.
[25:45.660 --> 25:49.320]  Kion News reported that ordinary people must separate
[25:49.320 --> 25:52.160]  themselves from the rebels.
[25:52.160 --> 25:54.860]  And BBC released video clearly showing
[25:54.860 --> 25:57.540]  the faces of several protesters, putting them
[25:57.540 --> 25:59.340]  at risk of arrest and torture.
[25:59.340 --> 26:03.800]  Reza Pallavi encouraged people to protest in his name.
[26:03.800 --> 26:08.340]  He tweeted out, Pallavi has always been with the people
[26:08.340 --> 26:11.140]  and hashtag people power.
[26:11.140 --> 26:14.420]  But when people began getting arrested and killed,
[26:14.420 --> 26:18.780]  Pallavi's impotent tweets were useless.
[26:18.780 --> 26:21.760]  The MEK also encouraged people to protest
[26:21.760 --> 26:25.420]  without offering any actual support.
[26:25.420 --> 26:27.260]  There are now more than 200 people
[26:27.260 --> 26:29.660]  in the U.S. State Department.
[26:29.660 --> 26:33.260]  There are now video surfacing of schools being closed down
[26:33.260 --> 26:36.040]  and turned into detention centers.
[26:36.040 --> 26:39.980]  Video show protesters being shot at and killed,
[26:39.980 --> 26:43.980]  women being fired upon, bodies being beaten
[26:43.980 --> 26:46.180]  and dragged away unconscious.
[26:51.680 --> 26:55.060]  Reports are now that over 100 people have been killed.
[26:55.060 --> 26:57.460]  They have been announced that the U.S.
[26:57.460 --> 27:00.060]  will hold Iranian officials accountable
[27:00.060 --> 27:02.660]  and impose even greater sanctions
[27:02.660 --> 27:04.500]  against the struggling regime.
[27:06.940 --> 27:09.500]  The Islamic Republic is getting weak.
[27:09.500 --> 27:13.540]  Starting in 2005, the IRGC began acquiring
[27:13.540 --> 27:16.180]  state assets through shell companies
[27:16.180 --> 27:19.820]  to avoid being shut off by strict sanctions.
[27:19.820 --> 27:21.980]  And today, they control about half
[27:21.980 --> 27:25.260]  of its gross domestic product.
[27:25.260 --> 27:29.660]  This gives the IRGC independence from Rouhani.
[27:29.660 --> 27:32.100]  And their divide is growing stronger,
[27:32.100 --> 27:35.960]  which only fractures the regime even more.
[27:35.960 --> 27:38.540]  Through all of these recent protests,
[27:38.540 --> 27:41.880]  the restart movement remained silent,
[27:41.880 --> 27:44.880]  in part because the internet was shut down
[27:44.880 --> 27:48.220]  and they are not given a voice on state-run media
[27:48.220 --> 27:51.180]  like the other opposition groups are.
[27:51.180 --> 27:53.820]  And also, because they expressed concern
[27:53.820 --> 27:55.780]  for the safety of the people
[27:55.780 --> 27:59.120]  and questioned the authenticity of the protests.
[28:00.420 --> 28:02.860]  Iranians on social media suggested
[28:02.860 --> 28:05.660]  that the IRGC was trying to duplicate
[28:05.660 --> 28:09.300]  the restart movement's protests of the recent past
[28:09.300 --> 28:11.500]  and failing to do so.
[28:11.500 --> 28:14.100]  Iranian officials are now being accused
[28:14.100 --> 28:16.540]  of stealing dead bodies from morgues
[28:16.540 --> 28:19.040]  and injured patients from hospitals
[28:19.040 --> 28:21.340]  to hide the actual scale of violence
[28:21.340 --> 28:24.020]  being exercised by the Islamic Republic.
[28:25.280 --> 28:26.620]  While the people chanted,
[28:26.620 --> 28:29.260]  we don't want the Islamic Republic.
[28:29.260 --> 28:31.520]  Others tore down a sign that said,
[28:31.520 --> 28:35.120]  down with America, as the crowd cheered.
[28:35.120 --> 28:45.800]  For infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[28:56.840 --> 28:58.040]  Info war.
[28:58.040 --> 29:00.040]  Heart disease is on the rise,
[29:00.040 --> 29:01.920]  clogged arteries, high blood pressure
[29:01.920 --> 29:03.320]  and high cholesterol levels
[29:03.320 --> 29:05.420]  may not be fully detected by you,
[29:05.420 --> 29:06.920]  but the symptoms are there.
[29:06.920 --> 29:09.660]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops,
[29:09.660 --> 29:11.900]  poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[29:11.900 --> 29:13.920]  are just a few of these that can alert you
[29:13.920 --> 29:15.300]  that something is wrong.

[29:19.200 --> 29:21.200]  of people's lives across America.
[29:21.200 --> 29:23.040]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[29:23.040 --> 29:25.280]  My diabetes has totally improved.

[29:27.740 --> 29:29.680]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:29.680 --> 29:31.840]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[30:55.580 --> 30:57.740]  Please take action and fund this operation.
[30:57.740 --> 31:02.080]  Major report out of major university,
[31:02.080 --> 31:04.400]  researchers working on food-based treatment
[31:04.400 --> 31:06.160]  to slow aging science daily.
[31:06.160 --> 31:09.040]  Probiotics in the gut of a particular type
[31:09.040 --> 31:10.800]  cause your entire body to be healthier
[31:10.800 --> 31:11.720]  and make you live longer
[31:11.720 --> 31:13.680]  and make you not get intestinal cancer.
[31:13.680 --> 31:15.520]  We have the very best formula, literally,
[31:15.520 --> 31:17.360]  with what they even mentioned in the studies.
[31:17.360 --> 31:21.520]  And it explains that the hormone called FGF21,
[31:21.520 --> 31:24.240]  pro-longgevity, heals the entire body
[31:24.240 --> 31:25.960]  and actually reverses aging,
[31:25.960 --> 31:29.240]  but is only made in the lower intestine.
[31:29.240 --> 31:30.120]  Oh, and what does it say?
[31:30.120 --> 31:34.080]  It's fiber from a spectrum of certain types of berries
[31:34.080 --> 31:35.360]  that grows this.
[31:35.360 --> 31:37.280]  And yes, this is a plug, gut fusion.
[31:37.280 --> 31:38.960]  And what do we have in this?
[31:38.960 --> 31:42.160]  High auric berry blend, strawberry, blueberry,
[31:42.160 --> 31:45.760]  blackberry, cranberry, escoblio, grape, and pomegranate.
[31:45.760 --> 31:49.400]  It's the pulp from them that then grows this.
[31:49.400 --> 31:51.600]  Gut fusion for children, for young people,
[31:51.600 --> 31:52.720]  for old people, for everybody.
[31:52.720 --> 31:54.800]  This is fiber and glutamine.
[31:54.800 --> 31:56.120]  You're not gonna find a better formula.
[31:56.120 --> 31:57.480]  Gut fusion, it's amazing.
[31:57.480 --> 31:58.680]  ImpalwareShore.com.
[32:00.440 --> 32:03.640]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true,
[32:03.640 --> 32:04.600]  but I'm here to tell ya,
[32:04.600 --> 32:07.320]  most of those really weren't predictions
[32:07.320 --> 32:09.600]  that came out of a crystal ball.
[32:09.600 --> 32:11.560]  I could see where the globalists were going.
[32:11.560 --> 32:14.440]  I could see what their in-game agenda was,
[32:14.440 --> 32:16.200]  what their goal was.
[32:16.200 --> 32:18.000]  And I knew that when they were setting us up
[32:18.000 --> 32:19.400]  to be deplatformed,
[32:19.400 --> 32:21.440]  that they were really setting the precedent
[32:21.440 --> 32:25.280]  to take everybody off air, to silence everyone,
[32:25.280 --> 32:29.440]  to ban words and names and information
[32:29.440 --> 32:30.960]  on fake whistleblowers,
[32:30.960 --> 32:34.240]  so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[32:34.240 --> 32:36.240]  What the globalists really feared
[32:36.240 --> 32:40.160]  was independent media and platforms in the future.
[32:40.160 --> 32:42.280]  It was the model of Info Wars,
[32:42.280 --> 32:45.640]  as much as the information that had to be silenced,
[32:45.640 --> 32:48.200]  because they need total information dominance
[32:48.200 --> 32:49.760]  for their outrageous lies,
[32:49.760 --> 32:51.680]  and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[32:51.680 --> 32:53.880]  And that's why keeping Info Wars on the air
[32:53.880 --> 32:57.200]  is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[33:01.320 --> 33:04.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:04.400 --> 33:25.880]  MUSIC
[33:25.880 --> 33:28.480]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[33:28.480 --> 33:31.400]  you are the Resistance.
[33:31.400 --> 33:36.800]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:38.960 --> 33:44.240]  It is December 2nd, 2019, on this Monday edition.
[33:44.240 --> 33:45.960]  We're live at studio,
[33:45.960 --> 33:48.160]  and I'll be hosting the fourth hour today as well.
[33:48.160 --> 33:50.960]  This really is 33 minutes into the show,
[33:50.960 --> 33:52.960]  the start of the broadcast.
[33:52.960 --> 33:57.800]  I was here yesterday and ready to do the Sunday show
[33:57.800 --> 33:59.640]  and just didn't do it.
[33:59.640 --> 34:03.520]  And I was ready here to do today's broadcast,
[34:03.520 --> 34:07.200]  and I decided I wasn't going to do it.
[34:07.200 --> 34:08.920]  I was just going to leave,
[34:08.920 --> 34:12.960]  and then I decided just to go ahead and come back and do it.
[34:12.960 --> 34:15.320]  That's not a reflection on the crew,
[34:15.320 --> 34:17.920]  and it's not me being a prima donna.
[34:17.920 --> 34:23.800]  It's that I'm going to shake this broadcast up,
[34:23.800 --> 34:27.320]  and I'm going to shake up what I'm doing
[34:27.320 --> 34:31.080]  against the Globalist in a lot of different ways.
[34:31.080 --> 34:34.320]  And I'm not going to just wait on these ideas I've had for years.
[34:34.320 --> 34:37.480]  I'm going to implement them one way or another.
[34:37.480 --> 34:40.960]  And so, coming up in the next few days and weeks,
[34:40.960 --> 34:43.520]  I'm going to host whole shows as a Globalist,
[34:43.520 --> 34:48.000]  just attacking God, Christianity, the family, everything.
[34:48.000 --> 34:49.440]  I'm going to just come...
[34:49.440 --> 34:52.880]  You think that demon, Sasha Berry Cohen, can get into characters?
[34:52.880 --> 34:55.800]  I'm going to really tell you what they think of you
[34:55.800 --> 34:58.000]  and go from their perspective.
[35:00.000 --> 35:03.040]  And I'm going to do it without scripts, without anything.
[35:03.040 --> 35:04.760]  I know the enemy inside now.
[35:04.760 --> 35:08.400]  I'm going to show you who they are.
[35:11.400 --> 35:15.280]  Because that will get people talking,
[35:15.280 --> 35:17.880]  and that will get people thinking.
[35:17.880 --> 35:21.640]  Because I refuse to be stagnant.
[35:21.640 --> 35:29.200]  Also, I've got a lot of other tricks up my sleeve
[35:29.200 --> 35:31.200]  that I'm going to be implementing in the next few days
[35:31.200 --> 35:32.200]  and next few weeks.
[35:32.200 --> 35:36.720]  And I just want our hardcore audience to know that,
[35:36.720 --> 35:39.600]  so that when you tune in and you hear these things,
[35:39.600 --> 35:42.080]  and you hear me saying these things,
[35:42.080 --> 35:45.000]  that you understand it's done to get people thinking
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.400]  and to get them out of their trance.
[35:48.400 --> 35:50.440]  Because I am not just going to come in here
[35:50.440 --> 35:55.280]  and chronicle the takedown of civilization and humanity
[35:55.280 --> 35:59.720]  without really throwing some curveballs at the establishment.
[35:59.720 --> 36:05.160]  Also, I'm going to be in this third dimension
[36:05.160 --> 36:08.400]  a lot more on the streets.
[36:08.400 --> 36:11.800]  And I'm going to be doing a lot of other PowerPoint-type
[36:11.800 --> 36:19.000]  presentations in the next 336 days.
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.680]  Because, believe me, that is a very important number
[36:21.680 --> 36:24.600]  for this election and what's unfolding,
[36:24.600 --> 36:27.400]  and the attempts to impeach the president
[36:27.400 --> 36:30.240]  and that ongoing fiasco.
[36:37.240 --> 36:41.880]  But there is no rhyme or reason to what the globalists are
[36:41.880 --> 36:44.360]  doing, because they're chaos, they're destruction, they're
[36:44.360 --> 36:48.360]  death, the collapse of all that is good.
[36:48.360 --> 36:50.640]  Because that exists in the universe,
[36:50.640 --> 36:53.560]  because there's free will.
[36:53.560 --> 37:01.680]  And so I'm really going to do my best to cover it all today.
[37:01.680 --> 37:05.960]  And again, one reason that I almost didn't do the show
[37:05.960 --> 37:11.520]  today was that there's a constant frustration
[37:11.520 --> 37:16.960]  with this broadcast in that just one of the stories
[37:16.960 --> 37:20.800]  in my stack, we could spend four hours on and not
[37:20.800 --> 37:24.400]  properly hit every angle of it to have real understanding.
[37:29.520 --> 37:35.280]  And every day, there's at least 20 stories out of the 300
[37:35.280 --> 37:40.640]  or so in front of me that are that big, that are earth
[37:40.640 --> 37:43.600]  shaking.
[37:43.600 --> 37:46.160]  And so I'm constantly trying to gauge
[37:46.160 --> 37:51.200]  whether I should just cover one topic over a broadcast
[37:51.200 --> 37:54.240]  or whether I should just blitz through all of this
[37:54.240 --> 37:58.800]  information so that people get an idea of what's
[37:58.800 --> 38:03.680]  happening and unfolding and how those systems tie together.
[38:03.680 --> 38:05.640]  I mean, here's an example.
[38:05.640 --> 38:09.480]  They have the CEO of YouTube coming out and saying,
[38:09.480 --> 38:11.720]  yeah, we censor and we're going to control what you see
[38:11.720 --> 38:13.760]  and it's our right to do it.
[38:13.760 --> 38:15.640]  So they're going from denying it to now being
[38:15.640 --> 38:17.040]  out in the open.
[38:17.040 --> 38:20.880]  And then she talks about how terrible it is,
[38:20.880 --> 38:25.200]  how the moderators have to watch people like me
[38:25.200 --> 38:27.440]  and why they need AI to be able to do it and not
[38:27.440 --> 38:28.840]  have Alex Jones do it.
[38:28.840 --> 38:32.120]  This is on 60 Minutes.
[38:32.120 --> 38:38.080]  Because if the people have to watch the evil Alex Jones
[38:38.080 --> 38:42.160]  and other things while they're getting infected with it,
[38:42.160 --> 38:51.520]  you see, so that admission right there
[38:51.520 --> 38:54.920]  is just incredible that their own human moderators
[38:54.920 --> 38:57.200]  go and watch this information, other information,
[38:57.200 --> 38:59.640]  and get convicted with the truth.
[39:06.120 --> 39:08.880]  So they're just trying to figure out a system to fully
[39:08.880 --> 39:11.440]  replace humans with computers.
[39:11.440 --> 39:13.880]  And that's why they want to replace the military with robots
[39:13.880 --> 39:15.760]  and computers and autonomous machines,
[39:15.760 --> 39:19.080]  so that they will follow the orders like a machine
[39:19.080 --> 39:20.920]  unthinkingly, and you'll have a real
[39:20.920 --> 39:23.920]  technocracy on your hands.
[39:23.920 --> 39:26.760]  But then there's added envelopes of propaganda
[39:26.760 --> 39:32.120]  and the disrespect that these technocrats have for us
[39:32.120 --> 39:33.920]  and the disrespect they have for themselves.
[39:36.760 --> 39:40.120]  If you put the headline back up, she says, oh, it's more
[39:40.120 --> 39:45.440]  important than ever that we be a free and open platform.
[39:45.440 --> 39:49.480]  That's why we have a right to censor everybody.
[39:49.480 --> 39:51.320]  There's the quote, more important than ever
[39:51.320 --> 39:56.000]  to be an open platform one day after massive banning spree.
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.680]  Remember a few months ago, she came out,
[39:57.680 --> 39:59.840]  and she said, everyone's invited back.
[39:59.840 --> 40:00.960]  We have free speech.
[40:00.960 --> 40:04.160]  No one is censored, as the purges expanded.
[40:04.160 --> 40:07.240]  So as a joke, oh, and Troyer put a channel back up
[40:07.240 --> 40:09.080]  and said, we're invited back on.
[40:09.080 --> 40:12.360]  And they banned us within hours and said, no, no, no, no.
[40:12.360 --> 40:14.640]  What you do is in speech.
[40:14.640 --> 40:18.240]  We allow all speech, you're not speech.
[40:18.240 --> 40:20.640]  So it was just another slap in the face
[40:20.640 --> 40:26.560]  on exercise in satanic inversion.
[40:26.560 --> 40:29.600]  That's one of these stories.
[40:29.600 --> 40:34.040]  Now, there's another one that on so many levels
[40:34.040 --> 40:36.920]  hit me like a ton of bricks this morning
[40:36.920 --> 40:41.280]  and also made me very angry at myself
[40:41.280 --> 40:44.080]  because I haven't done enough work getting
[40:44.080 --> 40:46.760]  a big enough crew together or being focused
[40:46.760 --> 40:51.800]  or doing my job to work hard enough to make sure it happened.
[40:51.800 --> 40:59.080]  Because we have bombshell information that's confirmed.
[40:59.080 --> 41:01.200]  And we put an article out about it,
[41:01.200 --> 41:03.680]  but we didn't have any fanfare.
[41:03.680 --> 41:05.360]  Like, ooh, look, we're important.
[41:05.360 --> 41:07.600]  Oh, look, this is important.
[41:07.600 --> 41:09.400]  None of that ritual was done.
[41:09.400 --> 41:14.240]  So it went just right with zero effect, just dead.
[41:14.240 --> 41:16.480]  OK?
[41:16.480 --> 41:18.760]  It's like we produce things to hide them.
[41:18.760 --> 41:22.360]  We produce things to actually make sure it doesn't matter.
[41:24.880 --> 41:26.760]  We're not excited about ourselves.
[41:26.760 --> 41:29.000]  We're not excited about how we've changed the world
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.680]  and how we've broken through and defeated the globalist
[41:31.680 --> 41:33.680]  on so many fronts.
[41:33.680 --> 41:35.840]  We always marvel at anybody else's production
[41:35.840 --> 41:38.920]  or anything else out there, because we'll always
[41:38.920 --> 41:41.560]  be that garage band that never got a gig.
[41:41.560 --> 41:43.120]  That's what Info Wars is.
[41:43.120 --> 41:44.640]  There's always that mindset.
[41:44.640 --> 41:47.560]  And I'm just externalizing all of this
[41:47.560 --> 41:49.720]  because when it happened, I said,
[41:49.720 --> 41:51.680]  we got to go down to that facility.
[41:51.680 --> 41:55.200]  We got to talk to those people.
[41:55.200 --> 41:56.840]  And it's not that anybody's bad around here.
[41:56.840 --> 41:57.680]  We just didn't.
[41:57.680 --> 42:00.880]  I mean, they have a warehouse with people microchipped
[42:00.880 --> 42:01.920]  at it in Austin.
[42:01.920 --> 42:04.760]  Now, we already know that from the documents.
[42:04.760 --> 42:06.680]  But somebody else did the interview,
[42:06.680 --> 42:10.080]  and it's got 1.2 million views, which is great,
[42:10.080 --> 42:12.400]  except it doesn't have the backstory on it
[42:12.400 --> 42:14.440]  so people know how dangerous it is.
[42:14.440 --> 42:18.000]  It's just a little hidden kernel in there.
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.560]  And the internet realized just a day or so ago
[42:20.560 --> 42:22.800]  how huge this was, how important this
[42:22.800 --> 42:25.000]  was that they're implanting people
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.440]  with microchips in a little smart city test grid that's
[42:28.440 --> 42:31.360]  an open air concentration camp in Austin, Texas.
[42:31.360 --> 42:33.720]  Other people were like, whoa, this
[42:33.720 --> 42:34.840]  is hidden in this video.
[42:34.840 --> 42:36.680]  No one is even pointing out what it is.
[42:36.680 --> 42:38.640]  But they knew it was important because they
[42:38.640 --> 42:40.360]  knew to tell people into care.
[42:40.360 --> 42:41.480]  They had a spirit.
[42:41.480 --> 42:42.840]  They had a resistance.
[42:42.840 --> 42:43.960]  They were alive.
[42:43.960 --> 42:46.280]  They weren't dead inside.
[42:46.280 --> 42:47.160]  Like I am.
[42:50.600 --> 42:53.240]  Weak and broken, failed.
[42:53.240 --> 42:53.720]  Done.
[42:53.720 --> 42:54.600]  Run our course.
[42:54.600 --> 42:55.100]  Finished.
[42:55.100 --> 42:58.660]  Beto O'Rourke came out dozens of times and said,
[42:58.660 --> 43:00.940]  we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles.
[43:00.940 --> 43:03.940]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage,
[43:03.940 --> 43:07.500]  nine others, to agree and said that he was a hero.
[43:07.500 --> 43:08.700]  Think about that.
[43:08.700 --> 43:10.740]  Now, those Democrats have taken all the guns
[43:10.740 --> 43:12.260]  in the cities they control.
[43:12.260 --> 43:14.980]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes,
[43:14.980 --> 43:18.940]  covered with needles and with massive drug dealing
[43:18.940 --> 43:21.980]  and incredible levels of violent crimes.
[43:21.980 --> 43:25.140]  They know what they're doing.
[43:25.140 --> 43:26.500]  And now the Supreme Court's come out
[43:26.500 --> 43:28.660]  and ruled that gun manufacturers can
[43:28.660 --> 43:32.460]  be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms.
[43:32.460 --> 43:34.060]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen,
[43:34.060 --> 43:36.060]  this country is under such incredible attack.
[43:36.060 --> 43:39.260]  But more and more towns and cities
[43:39.260 --> 43:41.860]  are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment.
[43:41.860 --> 43:44.060]  And they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights
[43:44.060 --> 43:45.260]  and Constitution.
[43:45.260 --> 43:48.140]  And they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[43:48.140 --> 43:50.060]  So you see, a lot of people are going
[43:50.060 --> 43:52.460]  to have to pay for the confiscation of guns.
[43:52.460 --> 43:54.060]  So you see, a lot of these cities
[43:54.060 --> 43:55.460]  ignore illegal aliens.

[44:59.140 --> 45:01.420]  Who is Alex Jones?
[45:01.420 --> 45:05.780]  Mainstream media calls him a conspiracy theorist, fake news,
[45:05.780 --> 45:09.380]  crazy, and worst of all, a fear monger.
[45:09.380 --> 45:12.500]  But the only thing to truly fear is missing out

[45:54.420 --> 45:58.420]  only this Black Friday at infowarstore.com.
[45:58.420 --> 45:59.540]  Fear of missing out is a serious condition.
[45:59.540 --> 46:02.060]  It can only be treated by going to infowarstore.com.
[46:02.060 --> 46:05.340]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General
[46:05.340 --> 46:08.900]  in the Korean War when 3 million Chai comms had
[46:08.900 --> 46:12.980]  flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines
[46:12.980 --> 46:16.420]  more than 50 to one, some estimates have it.
[46:16.420 --> 46:18.380]  But the point is they were outnumbered
[46:18.380 --> 46:20.460]  and the general was told,
[46:20.460 --> 46:21.740]  general were completely surrounded, he said,
[46:21.740 --> 46:25.860]  good, we can attack in all directions.
[46:25.860 --> 46:29.940]  Well, that's the point that info wars has reached.
[46:29.940 --> 46:32.140]  And it really is epic, it really is biblical,
[46:32.140 --> 46:33.860]  and we wouldn't have gone this far
[46:33.860 --> 46:35.300]  without all your support.
[46:35.300 --> 46:38.860]  But it's gonna become more critical than ever
[46:38.860 --> 46:41.740]  as the censorship becomes complete.
[46:41.740 --> 46:44.100]  And it's not just Americans, but folks all over the world
[46:44.100 --> 46:46.980]  are completely silenced when it comes to speaking
[46:46.980 --> 46:49.060]  the name of a CIA fake whistleblower
[46:49.060 --> 46:52.740]  or exposing a pedophile or speaking out
[46:52.740 --> 46:54.340]  against dangerous vaccines.
[46:54.340 --> 46:56.860]  Because by info wars having its own platform,
[46:56.860 --> 46:58.980]  that checkmates the globalists.
[46:58.980 --> 47:03.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:28.980 --> 47:37.620]  You know in this whole wide world,
[47:37.620 --> 47:41.020]  there's not a lot of broadcast that are independent
[47:42.020 --> 47:45.100]  that actually do their own research
[47:45.100 --> 47:47.980]  and come up with their own worldview.
[47:47.980 --> 47:49.980]  And there's certainly none out there
[47:49.980 --> 47:52.300]  that have an audience this large.
[47:52.300 --> 47:55.660]  And I respect this audience and I respect the crew
[47:55.660 --> 47:58.420]  and I respect everybody that makes this show possible.
[47:58.420 --> 48:00.300]  That's why I'm not gonna sit here
[48:01.500 --> 48:04.860]  and engage in a bunch of half-ass unconscious crap.
[48:06.340 --> 48:10.260]  And just chronicle and report on this ship going down
[48:10.260 --> 48:11.540]  that is free humanity.
[48:12.460 --> 48:15.060]  I don't take any pleasure watching humanity down
[48:15.060 --> 48:18.380]  on its knees, bleeding the death, covered maggots.
[48:19.980 --> 48:21.660]  I don't take any pleasure watching
[48:21.660 --> 48:23.780]  what's being done to our children.
[48:23.780 --> 48:26.500]  I don't take any pleasure watching what Hollywood
[48:26.500 --> 48:28.700]  and its death wish for culture is
[48:28.700 --> 48:30.940]  and I want to beat these people.
[48:31.820 --> 48:35.780]  And to do it, we're going to have to get conscious
[48:35.780 --> 48:39.620]  and we're going to have to realize we are in a war
[48:39.620 --> 48:44.100]  for our very freedoms and our very destinies,
[48:44.100 --> 48:45.740]  our very soul.
[48:45.740 --> 48:47.100]  That's it.
[48:47.100 --> 48:49.820]  You cannot build it up enough.
[48:49.820 --> 48:54.820]  So this whole first hour is basically us
[48:54.820 --> 48:57.180]  just warming the tires up, okay?
[48:57.180 --> 48:59.540]  And I'm going to host the next three hours today
[48:59.540 --> 49:02.860]  and I'm going to cover every damn piece of news
[49:02.860 --> 49:05.940]  in front of me or I'm going to die trying
[49:06.940 --> 49:09.700]  because it needs to come out and we need to chronicle
[49:09.700 --> 49:12.620]  every section of this because there's not just
[49:12.620 --> 49:13.940]  the general public listening.
[49:13.940 --> 49:16.060]  There are a lot of people making decisions
[49:16.060 --> 49:18.740]  that are listening that know the planet's going
[49:18.740 --> 49:22.700]  in the wrong direction and know that we need to organize
[49:22.700 --> 49:27.700]  a cultural, governmental, economic, spiritual system
[49:28.700 --> 49:30.220]  to challenge it.
[49:30.220 --> 49:33.340]  And we already have the tools to defeat the globalist
[49:33.340 --> 49:37.340]  but we have to recognize their attack for what it is.
[49:37.340 --> 49:42.340]  A post human exterminist tower of Babel agenda.
[49:44.940 --> 49:46.780]  Let me tell you what I'm going to cover
[49:46.780 --> 49:47.940]  and I'm just going to do it.
[49:47.940 --> 49:49.780]  I'm going to do it in this order.
[49:49.780 --> 49:51.060]  When we start the next hour,
[49:51.060 --> 49:56.060]  I'm going to cover frozen, which was so filled
[49:56.540 --> 50:01.540]  with propaganda that I had a giant headache when I left.
[50:02.780 --> 50:06.380]  I took my oldest and middle daughter to it
[50:06.380 --> 50:11.380]  and three of their friends and it was a satanic bombardment
[50:11.380 --> 50:16.380]  of our children that was nauseating.
[50:19.460 --> 50:23.420]  But we're going to look at the different layers of it
[50:23.420 --> 50:27.940]  because knowing the enemy's art,
[50:27.940 --> 50:30.380]  knowing what their world view is
[50:30.380 --> 50:32.380]  and how these different layers tie together
[50:32.380 --> 50:34.940]  and what the end product is, is how we beat them.
[50:35.940 --> 50:37.660]  So I watched frozen,
[50:37.660 --> 50:41.580]  so you don't have to, but let me tell you,
[50:42.580 --> 50:43.420]  pedophilic,
[50:46.580 --> 50:47.420]  bestiality,
[50:49.580 --> 50:50.420]  occult,
[50:52.100 --> 50:53.260]  anti-western,
[50:57.020 --> 50:57.860]  anti-technology,
[50:59.900 --> 51:01.220]  it was everything.
[51:01.220 --> 51:02.860]  And if you want to know where we're going,
[51:02.860 --> 51:05.380]  you just need to start with the same thing.
[51:05.380 --> 51:07.860]  You want to know where we're going, you just need to see
[51:07.860 --> 51:08.700]  that film.
[51:08.700 --> 51:10.860]  So I'll tell you about that, give you my view on it.
[51:15.220 --> 51:19.740]  Then I'm going to get into the latest wave
[51:19.740 --> 51:22.260]  of the fake impeachment and how that ties together
[51:23.700 --> 51:27.420]  and the next wave of massive censorship that's unfolding.
[51:28.580 --> 51:31.220]  Facebook's now deleting photos of Melania Trump
[51:31.220 --> 51:32.900]  saying that's hate speech.
[51:32.900 --> 51:37.180]  Buttigieg nods at the so-called black church,
[51:37.180 --> 51:38.420]  the communist church,
[51:39.580 --> 51:40.700]  when they talk about illegal aliens
[51:40.700 --> 51:42.460]  just reclaiming stolen land.
[51:44.100 --> 51:45.500]  We're going to get into that.
[51:46.620 --> 51:48.660]  We're going to get into the record cold temperatures
[51:48.660 --> 51:52.420]  of global warming, Epstein tapes,
[51:52.420 --> 51:55.860]  reported tapes from quote hacker about to be released,
[51:55.860 --> 51:57.340]  showing the world leaders that were there
[51:57.340 --> 51:58.980]  in the pedophile orgies.
[51:58.980 --> 52:03.220]  So that could be Trump's big revenge against them.
[52:03.220 --> 52:05.180]  I certainly hope that's the case.
[52:05.180 --> 52:07.180]  Release them now.
[52:07.180 --> 52:09.980]  Flood us with the information just like WikiLeaks.
[52:09.980 --> 52:13.980]  Deal the death blow, release the Kraken.
[52:15.380 --> 52:18.620]  A big viral video that's linked on dredgerport.com
[52:18.620 --> 52:21.340]  from Paul Joseph Watson of newswars.com.
[52:21.340 --> 52:24.380]  China man interrogated for criticizing police
[52:24.380 --> 52:27.980]  on social media in a torture chair.
[52:27.980 --> 52:29.340]  We'll get to all of that.
[52:31.300 --> 52:34.460]  We're also going to look at obviously
[52:34.460 --> 52:36.340]  the latest little terror attack.
[52:37.540 --> 52:39.340]  It's not little of your two of the people that died
[52:39.340 --> 52:43.900]  being stabbed to death from the jihadi out on prison leave.
[52:43.900 --> 52:46.300]  We're plotting to blow up the stock exchange,
[52:46.300 --> 52:48.700]  but there's a lot of stories and a lot of evidence
[52:48.700 --> 52:49.540]  that ties into this.
[52:49.540 --> 52:50.740]  It's really illustrative.
[52:50.740 --> 52:52.080]  That's all coming up.
[52:52.080 --> 52:57.080]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg holding on to life by her fingernails.
[53:01.680 --> 53:03.480]  That raises the prospect of election year
[53:03.480 --> 53:04.560]  Supreme Court battle.
[53:04.560 --> 53:06.080]  Oh, there's no prospect of it.
[53:06.080 --> 53:10.520]  I bet all the tea in China and all the mountains on the moon
[53:14.800 --> 53:16.880]  that she's dead within six months.
[53:18.600 --> 53:21.360]  Meanwhile, China introduces mandatory face scans
[53:21.360 --> 53:23.040]  for phone users.
[53:23.040 --> 53:25.400]  Told you that a couple of years ago
[53:25.400 --> 53:27.080]  that that's the holy grail.
[53:27.080 --> 53:30.040]  Look at the operating system of the droids and the iPhones.
[53:30.040 --> 53:31.640]  And it's already in place.
[53:31.640 --> 53:34.400]  And boy, once it comes into place,
[53:35.280 --> 53:37.160]  if you don't submit to their agenda,
[53:37.160 --> 53:38.960]  you will be turned off.
[53:38.960 --> 53:41.280]  And you're like, oh, I'll just be a leftist.
[53:41.280 --> 53:43.320]  No, you're going to take hundreds of vaccines.
[53:43.320 --> 53:44.980]  You're going to eat GMO.
[53:44.980 --> 53:47.000]  You're going to hand your kids over to pedophiles.
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.280]  And that's just the start.
[53:48.280 --> 53:53.280]  If you want to be allowed to walk around quote free
[53:53.600 --> 53:55.760]  in this demonic hell pit.
[53:57.240 --> 54:00.200]  So that's just some of what's coming up today.
[54:02.200 --> 54:03.240]  But it's kind of a good thing.
[54:03.240 --> 54:06.000]  We heard four or five reports at the start of the show.
[54:08.320 --> 54:09.160]  But I was just
[54:09.160 --> 54:14.160]  pregnant with all these plans I want to implement
[54:19.360 --> 54:21.240]  because you get to see a lot of the amazing reports
[54:21.240 --> 54:24.160]  that are banned on video and nowhere else.
[54:24.160 --> 54:27.320]  You know, imagine in America building your own platform
[54:27.320 --> 54:31.480]  so you can at least put out your view of the world
[54:31.480 --> 54:36.480]  and challenge this anti-human, post-human agenda.
[54:36.480 --> 54:39.160]  And the only way those brush fires spread
[54:39.160 --> 54:43.720]  is when you take the fire of truth at Vandavidia
[54:43.720 --> 54:46.560]  and when you share it while you still can.
[54:49.160 --> 54:52.660]  Because make no mistake, they're breathing down our neck.
[54:52.660 --> 54:54.480]  And that isn't what angers me and upsets me.
[54:54.480 --> 54:56.840]  It's the fact that the enemy is so easy to beat
[54:58.360 --> 55:02.640]  but that we have been so buffaloed, so cowed,
[55:02.640 --> 55:04.880]  so driven into submission, so taught
[55:04.880 --> 55:09.120]  that we're just supposed to bend over to all this
[55:09.120 --> 55:12.280]  when it only makes it worse and only intensifies it.
[55:13.760 --> 55:18.600]  And then separately, there is the funding of this operation
[55:18.600 --> 55:20.960]  which is really something that should be easy to do
[55:20.960 --> 55:22.880]  because we really do have amazing products
[55:22.880 --> 55:24.400]  and things that are gonna make your life better
[55:24.400 --> 55:27.000]  in a symbiotic relationship, water filtration,
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.600]  air filtration, non-gmo heirloom seeds,
[55:29.600 --> 55:32.280]  great patriot apparel to help spread the word
[55:32.280 --> 55:36.800]  from sweatshirts to t-shirts to ball caps to so much more.
[55:36.800 --> 55:38.600]  And we have the limited edition.
[55:38.600 --> 55:40.280]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself,
[55:40.280 --> 55:44.360]  t-shirt that says Christmas lights are a lot
[55:44.360 --> 55:45.680]  like Jeffrey Epstein.
[55:45.680 --> 55:47.320]  They don't hang themselves on the back.
[55:47.320 --> 55:51.640]  It says infowars.com and the O is a noose
[55:51.640 --> 55:54.120]  and that is a limited edition shirt
[55:54.120 --> 55:56.440]  only available through Christmas.
[55:56.440 --> 55:58.720]  And we will again, not produce anymore.
[55:58.720 --> 56:00.360]  Get yours at infowarstore.com.
[56:00.360 --> 56:03.800]  And again, I didn't do the Sunday show.
[56:03.800 --> 56:05.680]  I was here ready to rock, ready to go.
[56:05.680 --> 56:09.560]  I just didn't do the show
[56:09.560 --> 56:13.800]  because I just didn't feel like I was prepared
[56:13.800 --> 56:16.600]  to properly cover information.
[56:16.600 --> 56:18.760]  I'm not just gonna rattle this information off.
[56:18.760 --> 56:21.400]  I'm not going to just sit here and do things
[56:21.400 --> 56:22.560]  the way I've done things in the past.
[56:22.560 --> 56:24.280]  And yes, we've done a lot of good things
[56:24.280 --> 56:27.120]  and we've been game changing and you've been part of that
[56:27.120 --> 56:30.840]  but there's a lot more we're going to do.
[56:30.840 --> 56:32.360]  You've got my commitment.
[56:32.360 --> 56:33.880]  You're going to see it.
[56:33.880 --> 56:36.000]  You're gonna see a lot more action.
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.320]  You're gonna see more informative guests.
[56:39.320 --> 56:43.640]  We are not gonna just stagnantly sit here and rot.
[56:43.640 --> 56:46.360]  All the globalists overrun society and civilization.
[56:46.360 --> 56:49.760]  I've got my brain working overtime
[56:49.760 --> 56:51.880]  and I've already got a whole bunch of plans
[56:51.880 --> 56:54.920]  that I know if we just faithfully execute them
[56:54.920 --> 56:56.760]  are going to devastate the new order.
[56:56.760 --> 56:59.560]  And they know it too.
[56:59.560 --> 57:02.680]  So we've got the Black Friday special
[57:02.680 --> 57:07.520]  that is an extension of the Black Friday
[57:07.520 --> 57:09.320]  we've been having the last month.
[57:09.320 --> 57:12.960]  But these are crescendoing into the biggest sales
[57:12.960 --> 57:14.440]  of the year right now.
[57:14.440 --> 57:16.880]  Triple Patriot Point, store-wide free shipping.
[57:17.840 --> 57:19.080]  You get additional 10% off.
[57:19.080 --> 57:21.880]  You sign up for auto-ship canceling time for free.
[57:21.880 --> 57:23.800]  Get 10% off on the order you're making.
[57:23.800 --> 57:25.360]  Nobody's got that.
[57:25.360 --> 57:27.920]  DNA Force Plus, 50% off with a free bottle,
[57:27.920 --> 57:28.840]  the Brain Force Plus.
[57:28.840 --> 57:32.040]  Get X2 and X3 with a free bottle, a Brain Force Plus.
[57:32.040 --> 57:34.080]  A lot of these specials are gonna have to end.
[57:34.080 --> 57:36.800]  A few of these specials will continue on later in the week
[57:36.800 --> 57:39.000]  but a lot of these sales have to end.
[57:39.000 --> 57:40.240]  Crill Oil's back in stock.
[57:40.240 --> 57:41.560]  We have the new.
[57:41.560 --> 57:44.960]  Tooth whitening, fluoride-free toothpaste,
[57:44.960 --> 57:46.640]  super silver and so much more.
[57:48.400 --> 57:51.920]  The Anti-Defamation League is one of the most powerful,
[57:51.920 --> 57:55.440]  globalist, leftist, anti-American organizations
[57:55.440 --> 57:56.680]  on the face of the planet.
[57:56.680 --> 57:59.240]  And they have declared that info wars
[57:59.240 --> 58:01.440]  is public enemy number one.
[58:01.440 --> 58:05.440]  They gave Tim Cook of Apple an award specifically
[58:05.440 --> 58:07.880]  for de-platforming me to make sure
[58:07.880 --> 58:11.720]  that tens of millions of people could not hear the show.
[58:11.720 --> 58:13.960]  And now they've had Sasha Barrett Cohen come out
[58:13.960 --> 58:18.160]  and call for the arrest of big tech heads
[58:18.160 --> 58:22.040]  that do not turn full control over to the globalist ADL
[58:22.040 --> 58:25.040]  and they've called for a complete purge
[58:25.040 --> 58:27.360]  of anyone promoting Americana.
[58:27.360 --> 58:29.840]  We are being demoralized, we are being conquered
[58:29.840 --> 58:32.080]  and the enemy wants to shut info wars down
[58:32.080 --> 58:34.640]  because they understand that we've got their number
[58:34.640 --> 58:36.320]  and know how to defeat their paradigm.
[58:36.320 --> 58:38.040]  You have helped keep us on the air
[58:38.040 --> 58:40.680]  but now the attacks are more insane than ever.
[58:40.680 --> 58:43.440]  So please visit infowarstore.com during Black Friday
[58:43.440 --> 58:44.720]  for the biggest sales of the year
[58:44.720 --> 58:45.720]  and fund the info war.
[58:45.720 --> 58:48.960]  Please take action.
[58:48.960 --> 58:54.160]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[58:54.160 --> 58:59.600]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant
[58:59.600 --> 59:02.040]  will take humanity to?
[59:02.040 --> 59:02.960]  How far will they go?
[59:02.960 --> 59:04.040]  What's their limit?
[59:04.040 --> 59:08.800]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women
[59:08.800 --> 59:10.840]  will submit.
[59:10.840 --> 59:14.160]  The answer is there is no limit to evil.
[59:14.160 --> 59:17.160]  It is a bottomless pit.
[59:17.160 --> 59:19.520]  We've been taught in modern culture and society
[59:19.520 --> 59:24.040]  that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will,
[59:24.040 --> 59:25.800]  there's no devil or the God.
[59:25.800 --> 59:28.560]  But those very same people have all these rules for us
[59:28.560 --> 59:34.000]  about speech and how we can dress and where we can live
[59:34.000 --> 59:35.920]  and what our houses can be like.
[59:35.920 --> 59:38.320]  They just don't want us to have any values
[59:38.320 --> 59:40.040]  so they can run over us.
[59:40.040 --> 59:42.040]  Oxford's band clapping.
[59:42.040 --> 59:45.440]  University's the US of band 21 Gun Salutes for Veterans.
[59:45.440 --> 59:47.360]  These people are dangerous cult leaders
[59:47.360 --> 59:48.600]  and it's time to reject them.
[59:51.800 --> 59:54.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:00.720 --> 1:00:03.880]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[1:00:03.880 --> 1:00:06.520]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:06.520 --> 1:00:10.880]  Well, they're already calling in a war on journalists.
[1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:13.960]  Oh, Trump's never arrested whistleblowers,
[1:00:13.960 --> 1:00:18.320]  never indicted members of the press like Obama did.
[1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:19.920]  But Bloomberg said we're not going
[1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:23.240]  to investigate any Democrat candidates, only Trump.
[1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:25.200]  Well, that's not a news organization.
[1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:30.040]  That's a devilish disinformation fake news op.
[1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:32.960]  So breaking Trump campaign will no longer
[1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:36.640]  credentialed Bloomberg news reporters.
[1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:40.320]  That's up on dredgereport.com, a gateway-pundit article.
[1:00:40.320 --> 1:00:44.680]  And is it that what you do when you're dealing
[1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:49.520]  with such a fake organization?
[1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:52.080]  And the fact that they would do that,
[1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:56.560]  you see there's no shame in corporate establishment
[1:00:56.560 --> 1:01:01.200]  mouthpiece decepticon media that calls them self-MSM.
[1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:09.440]  And now that entire MSM is like a deer in the headlights,
[1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:12.440]  saying, yes, actually, we are censoring everybody,
[1:01:12.440 --> 1:01:14.920]  and it's our right to do it.
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:17.120]  And we're not going to let Trump put out ads on Facebook
[1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:19.840]  saying we're looking for strong women.
[1:01:19.840 --> 1:01:21.200]  We're not going to let people put out
[1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:24.040]  images of Melania Trump promoting the campaign
[1:01:24.040 --> 1:01:26.920]  because she looks too good and is too effective.
[1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:29.280]  So they are now calling that hate speech.
[1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:34.840]  And Trump is going to sit there and do absolutely nothing.
[1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:38.200]  And then I'm supposed to sit here like a happy cult member
[1:01:38.200 --> 1:01:42.120]  and go over the edge of the cliff while this is unfolding.
[1:01:42.120 --> 1:01:45.200]  Since when in America on the main communication system,
[1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:48.240]  that's Facebook, biggest communication system in the world,
[1:01:48.240 --> 1:01:51.640]  private messages are being reviewed by AI and humans.
[1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:54.520]  And by the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center,
[1:01:54.520 --> 1:01:56.520]  they're in your Facebook instant messages
[1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:59.360]  and that's not enough for Sacha Bericoen.
[1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:02.400]  He wants Zuckerberg arrested.
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:03.280]  He's not doing enough.
[1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:09.680]  What a pack of control-free pirates.
[1:02:14.360 --> 1:02:19.160]  Because we lay down to it, because we roll over to it,
[1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:23.880]  it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse.
[1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:26.880]  And worse and worse and worse.
[1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:42.120]  So Trump is having the 2020 election stolen and the campaigns.
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:45.400]  Well, polls show the president's gotten more popular
[1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:46.200]  with impeachment.
[1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:48.600]  Yeah, that's why they're going to steal it from you, buddy, boy.
[1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:51.320]  Hey, we're polling better with internal polls
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:53.480]  than we did four years ago.
[1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:58.040]  Yeah, that's why they're going to steal it from you, Trump.
[1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:00.800]  Yes, we know the propaganda's not working
[1:03:00.800 --> 1:03:03.200]  on the majority of people.
[1:03:04.200 --> 1:03:08.360]  But it doesn't matter because over half the machines
[1:03:08.360 --> 1:03:14.760]  are owned by subsidiaries of, oh, you guessed it, George Soros.
[1:03:14.760 --> 1:03:16.280]  Anybody can look that up?
[1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:24.200]  And nothing is done, because the political class wants
[1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:27.760]  to remove Trump from power.
[1:03:27.760 --> 1:03:32.480]  And Trump just thinks if he has a few more stops
[1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:35.480]  and gives a few more speeches, he'll overpower and override
[1:03:35.480 --> 1:03:37.560]  that, and that's not the case.
[1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:42.080]  But start your engines, because when we come back,
[1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:47.720]  I'm going to systematically, though through all of the news,
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:04:02.960]  first frozen to a stunning window into the mind of the deranged
[1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:06.440]  lunatics that own and run the planet.
[1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:09.040]  And so if you want to know what they're thinking,
[1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:14.480]  if you want to know what they're doing,
[1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:17.680]  if you want to know what their agenda is,
[1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:21.480]  all you got to do is turn the television set on,
[1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:26.960]  and it is a gateway into hell itself.
[1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:32.480]  A rift in the time-space continuum, a gateway
[1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:37.200]  to the nether regions of the universe's dark stinking
[1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:46.000]  corners with long, terry tentacles reaching out,
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.440]  looking for however many children it can snare
[1:04:48.440 --> 1:04:49.880]  in its vetted claws.
[1:04:56.760 --> 1:05:00.960]  Black Friday is here, and the sales are so numerous,
[1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:03.000]  there is no way to go over all of them.
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:06.640]  But let me just give you an example of some of the sales
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:09.400]  we have running right now.
[1:05:09.400 --> 1:05:14.480]  DNA Force Plus, our flagship product, 50% off,
[1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:17.160]  free shipping, triple Patriot points.
[1:05:17.160 --> 1:05:19.400]  That's 15% off on your next order.
[1:05:19.400 --> 1:05:20.720]  If you sign up for auto-ship, you
[1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:24.080]  should have 10% off on that order, making it a loss leader.
[1:05:24.080 --> 1:05:27.840]  But on top of it, I'm offering a free bottle of Brain Force
[1:05:27.840 --> 1:05:30.320]  Plus, our number one best-selling product,
[1:05:30.320 --> 1:05:33.000]  so that those of you that haven't tried it
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:36.880]  can see how it gives you clean, focused, mental stamina
[1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:40.720]  is the term that I use, with none of the hangovers.
[1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:44.600]  Again, that's just one of the sales going right now,
[1:05:44.600 --> 1:05:49.360]  50% off, free shipping, triple Patriot points,
[1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:52.200]  free bottle of Brain Force Plus with DNA Force Plus
[1:05:52.200 --> 1:05:53.520]  at m4store.com.
[1:05:53.520 --> 1:05:55.440]  Please take action and fund this operation.
[1:05:57.920 --> 1:05:59.760]  OK, Olaf, you're up.
[1:05:59.760 --> 1:06:03.600]  Unicorn, T5, oh, Elsa.
[1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:05.520]  I don't think Olaf should get to rearrange.
[1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:07.520]  Doesn't matter, this is going to be a cinch.
[1:06:07.520 --> 1:06:12.600]  Oh, uh, distracted, worried?
[1:06:12.600 --> 1:06:14.560]  Has Elsa seemed weird to you?
[1:06:14.560 --> 1:06:17.600]  She seems like Elsa.
[1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:18.960]  There's this voice.
[1:06:18.960 --> 1:06:19.560]  Voice?
[1:06:19.560 --> 1:06:20.400]  What does that mean?
[1:06:24.400 --> 1:06:25.520]  Head for the cliff.
[1:06:25.520 --> 1:06:28.760]  Who's shaking in the building?
[1:06:28.760 --> 1:06:33.200]  The kingdom is not safe.
[1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:35.840]  Find who is calling to you.
[1:06:35.840 --> 1:06:38.000]  They may have answered.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:44.240]  Go north, across the enchanted lands, and into the unknown.
[1:06:44.240 --> 1:06:47.320]  We do this together, OK?
[1:06:47.320 --> 1:06:49.680]  Be careful.
[1:06:49.680 --> 1:07:03.080]  The spirits will challenge you every step of the way.
[1:07:03.080 --> 1:07:06.160]  That's normal.
[1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:06.920]  Who are you?
[1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:08.920]  Hi, I'm Oma.
[1:07:08.920 --> 1:07:09.920]  Oh, sorry.
[1:07:09.920 --> 1:07:22.640]  Yeah, I just bought your clothes.
[1:07:22.640 --> 1:07:25.160]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:07:25.160 --> 1:07:28.160]  you are the resistance.
[1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:32.760]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:43.760]  Frozen 2 is a demonic seduction.
[1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:51.760]  Frozen 2 is Hollywood and the satanic pedophile vampires
[1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:57.760]  trying to seduce and harm the children of the planet.
[1:07:57.760 --> 1:08:04.760]  It is a spider at the center of the web, drunk on the blood
[1:08:04.760 --> 1:08:11.760]  of the innocence, hungry for a giant feast.
[1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:17.760]  It's just been waiting for her.
[1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:21.760]  So I took my oldest and my middle daughter,
[1:08:21.760 --> 1:08:24.760]  I've got three daughters, and four of their friends
[1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:27.760]  to see Frozen.
[1:08:27.760 --> 1:08:28.760]  And I read some reviews.
[1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:31.760]  I knew it was going to be New Age propaganda.
[1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:34.760]  It was going to attack the West and have its own pilgrim story
[1:08:34.760 --> 1:08:38.760]  of the evil white settlers coming and killing the godlike natives,
[1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:42.760]  the peaceful, angelic creatures.
[1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:45.760]  But it was far worse than that.
[1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:53.760]  Serious occultism projected through a Rosicrucian lens,
[1:08:53.760 --> 1:09:04.760]  a lot of really deep occult iconography,
[1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:12.760]  projected at one level through a godly ethos
[1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:17.760]  so as to trick young children that have already had experiences
[1:09:17.760 --> 1:09:21.760]  with God's energy, with the Holy Spirit,
[1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:26.760]  to literally be drug into the dark by a huge anglerfish.
[1:09:26.760 --> 1:09:28.760]  And let's show folks an anglerfish.
[1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:30.760]  It has a false light hanging off its head
[1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:36.760]  and just inches away in the dark of the giant stinking teeth.
[1:09:36.760 --> 1:09:42.760]  So it is a real work of hell, not just the bestiality,
[1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:46.760]  not just the pedophilia, not just the young girls
[1:09:46.760 --> 1:09:51.760]  in bed together, obviously in a lesbian-esque event
[1:09:51.760 --> 1:10:00.760]  for young girls.
[1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:09.760]  But the image of the waterfall,
[1:10:09.760 --> 1:10:12.760]  God's light, the truth, the universe,
[1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:17.760]  the time-space continuum flowing, the living waters.
[1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:21.760]  And the West, and evil white men,
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:30.760]  have damned the water of God that is occultic earth worship.
[1:10:30.760 --> 1:10:33.760]  And that men have captured the goddess,
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:36.760]  the feminine energy, and have enslaved it.
[1:10:36.760 --> 1:10:46.760]  And only this lesbian queen can summon the power of the earth
[1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:52.760]  to crush the dam and release the feminine energy into the world
[1:10:52.760 --> 1:10:56.760]  and save us all.
[1:10:56.760 --> 1:10:59.760]  And that's the message.
[1:10:59.760 --> 1:11:03.760]  Let's make sure that woman never has a man and never has children.
[1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:08.760]  Let's make sure she never carries out the rituals God gave us
[1:11:08.760 --> 1:11:10.760]  that activate her power.
[1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:19.760]  Let's tell her her power comes from serving the state
[1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:28.760]  and turning her will over to be the fifth element,
[1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:35.760]  the Mary Magdalene that has sex with Jesus
[1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:38.760]  and then populates the earth.
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:40.760]  So she's a God.
[1:11:40.760 --> 1:11:45.760]  And the young girls learn they're going to be gods.
[1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:53.760]  And the evil white king who founded this new kingdom,
[1:11:53.760 --> 1:12:07.760]  he tried to steal the power and the essence of the unisex chief.
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:17.760]  And it turns out that his civilization and everything has to be destroyed
[1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:24.760]  because it was stolen from the natives.
[1:12:24.760 --> 1:12:30.760]  Basically, James Cameron's Avatar 2.0,
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:33.760]  and it's the same message over and over again
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:38.760]  by the horribly corrupt, wicked, satanic Hollywood
[1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:41.760]  that cheats everyone, that abuses everyone,
[1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:43.760]  that's completely soulless,
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:46.760]  that literally engages in human sacrifice.
[1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:49.760]  But it's telling you this message of earth worship
[1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:54.760]  and how everything's going to be wonderful
[1:12:54.760 --> 1:12:58.760]  once we just get rid of men in the family
[1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:06.760]  and once the women and children are just all alone in the woods,
[1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:15.760]  then you're going to be really powerful all alone in the woods.
[1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:20.760]  The film is an ice cream truck pulling up with ice cream music
[1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:24.760]  and sticking its arm out with an ice cream cone,
[1:13:24.760 --> 1:13:29.760]  inviting everyone to come over and pick their favorite flavor.
[1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:33.760]  And then, oh, by the way, come around back if you want a toy.
[1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:36.760]  And then the back door opens and there's another little kid standing there.
[1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:39.760]  He's got black circles around his eyes and cigarette burns on him,
[1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:43.760]  but you're not really noticing that because he's got a little toy snowman
[1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:46.760]  and he's cute and it's all about love.
[1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:50.760]  It's all about love and not having any discernment
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:53.760]  and just lowering your defenses and just get in the back.
[1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:58.760]  Here, we're going to close this door so we can have a little privacy.
[1:13:58.760 --> 1:14:03.760]  And next, there's a ball gag shoved in your mouth and you're hogtied
[1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:08.760]  and in a couple hours, people are going to be drinking your blood while you're alive.
[1:14:08.760 --> 1:14:13.760]  So the whole thing is an anglerfish. This light hung out in front,
[1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:17.760]  telling little girls you have this incredible power
[1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:25.760]  and you're going to have it because you're going to keep men out of your life
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:28.760]  and you're just going to let the spirit of the woods direct you
[1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:37.760]  and it's going to be really wonderful. Just come towards the light, Carol Ann.
[1:14:37.760 --> 1:14:42.760]  And it's all very, very cute and the spirits are going to conjure little cute geckos
[1:14:42.760 --> 1:14:46.760]  and things like this and wild horses and you're going to conquer it all.
[1:14:46.760 --> 1:14:50.760]  Just come towards the light and just never mind.
[1:14:50.760 --> 1:14:52.760]  You think you see some eyes and some teeth.
[1:14:52.760 --> 1:14:56.760]  Just go down that tunnel. Everything's okay.
[1:14:56.760 --> 1:14:59.760]  And you're going to be fulfilled. You're going to be empowered.
[1:14:59.760 --> 1:15:05.760]  Brace yourself for the adventure of being taken to Jeffrey Epstein's spider hole.
[1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:09.760]  And that's it.
[1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:13.760]  And then you think about who are the people that produce this and make this
[1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:17.760]  and it's every movie and it's every show attacking Christmas, attacking Thanksgiving,
[1:15:17.760 --> 1:15:22.760]  attacking families because they want you alone to have their way with you.
[1:15:22.760 --> 1:15:25.760]  And they run ads like, oh, it's like a fun Christmas movie
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:28.760]  where you sit around and you place your raids or whatever.
[1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:31.760]  No, that's not what it is. It's not the light.
[1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:35.760]  It's the false light of Lucifer and when you try to join with that light,
[1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:39.760]  you're going to find you're a slave forever and that's all it is.
[1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:43.760]  Meanwhile, again, the Native Americans were all killing each other,
[1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:47.760]  incredibly savage and vicious and would demand that the white settlers
[1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:51.760]  join them in attacking the neighboring tribe or they would kill them.
[1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:55.760]  It's just all lies.
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:15:58.760]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[1:15:58.760 --> 1:16:01.760]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[1:16:01.760 --> 1:16:05.760]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker,

[1:17:54.760 --> 1:18:01.760]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War
[1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:07.760]  when 3 million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines
[1:18:07.760 --> 1:18:11.760]  more than 50 to 1 some estimates have it.
[1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:15.760]  But the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told
[1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:20.760]  general were completely surrounded, he said, good, we can attack in all directions.
[1:18:20.760 --> 1:18:24.760]  Well, that's the point that Info Wars has reached.
[1:18:24.760 --> 1:18:27.760]  And it really is epic. It really is biblical.
[1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:30.760]  And we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[1:18:30.760 --> 1:18:37.760]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete.
[1:18:37.760 --> 1:18:41.760]  And it's not just Americans, but folks all over the world are completely silenced
[1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:46.760]  when it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile
[1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:50.760]  or speaking out against dangerous vaccines.
[1:18:50.760 --> 1:18:57.760]  Because by Info Wars having its own platform, that checkmates the globalist.
[1:18:57.760 --> 1:19:00.760]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true.
[1:19:00.760 --> 1:19:06.760]  But I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:08.760]  I could see where the globalists were going.
[1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:13.760]  I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[1:19:13.760 --> 1:19:16.760]  And I knew that when they were setting us up to be de-platformed
[1:19:16.760 --> 1:19:21.760]  that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air,
[1:19:21.760 --> 1:19:28.760]  to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers
[1:19:28.760 --> 1:19:31.760]  so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[1:19:31.760 --> 1:19:37.760]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:42.760]  It was the model of Info Wars as much as the information that had to be silenced.
[1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:46.760]  Because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies
[1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:48.760]  and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[1:19:48.760 --> 1:20:16.760]  That's why keeping Info Wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[1:20:16.760 --> 1:20:28.760]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[1:20:28.760 --> 1:20:39.760]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones.
[1:20:39.760 --> 1:20:53.760]  There is a publicly admitted global plan in place to carry out the orderly extermination of the human species.
[1:20:53.760 --> 1:20:58.760]  We are tracking who's behind it and how to stop it.
[1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:02.760]  Would you like to know more? I know I do.
[1:21:02.760 --> 1:21:07.760]  This is the real adventure on this planet.
[1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:11.760]  This simulation is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:21:11.760 --> 1:21:17.760]  Alright, finishing up with Frozen 2 and what it ties into.
[1:21:17.760 --> 1:21:21.760]  The left is all for free speech, the left hand path.
[1:21:21.760 --> 1:21:28.760]  While they're taking control, once they get the upper hand, they remove everyone else's speech.
[1:21:28.760 --> 1:21:45.760]  And then they start demanding that the left not just be for tolerance but accept pedophilia, bestiality, bloodletting, satanism, mass suicide, death cult, black pyramids, human sacrifice.
[1:21:45.760 --> 1:22:05.760]  Always the same transmission, always the same manifestation. Using our free will by increment, they are able to create a priest class by giving them otherworldly knowledge.
[1:22:05.760 --> 1:22:16.760]  Then they fully enslave that priest class and torture them into pure evil and then they begin the process to the next level.
[1:22:16.760 --> 1:22:25.760]  A giant satanic, anti-human Ponzi scheme, a black hole into hell.
[1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:28.760]  Remember, humans are master builders, made in the image of God.
[1:22:28.760 --> 1:22:34.760]  We get hijacked, the enemy is able to build monstrosities.
[1:22:34.760 --> 1:22:37.760]  Now let's continue.
[1:22:37.760 --> 1:22:50.760]  Church of Sweden unveils alter piece of paradise featuring, quote, gay couples and transgender serpent.
[1:22:50.760 --> 1:23:02.760]  Now remember what came out of the 3,000 priest and the mass investigation by the state police in Pennsylvania that concluded two years ago.
[1:23:02.760 --> 1:23:12.760]  That the priest said that once they'd been blackmailed to have sex with another man, then it was, we'll have sex with a teenager, have sex with a 12-year-old, have sex with an 8-year-old.
[1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:20.760]  Okay, rape of 5-year-old in a satanic ritual in the church on Saturday night.
[1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:26.760]  That's exactly how it works. They're like, oh, you're Satanist. Yeah, we're Satanist.
[1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:39.760]  And they would do it on the altar. So now they're externalizing the method of the blasphemy in God's face to bring the annihilation on the earth.
[1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:52.760]  See, Satan knows if he can piss God off enough and get enough of us to join in this or to not stand up to it.
[1:23:52.760 --> 1:24:03.760]  Well, then we can all be destroyed. The defense shield is removed. The hedge is dropped. Shield goes down.
[1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:10.760]  Demons come in. Hell breaks loose. Crazy town is here.
[1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:20.760]  And they have abodes of evil, command bases, nest where the spiders live and they suck the children in.
[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:26.760]  Have stories up on infowars.com. And it's all classic blasphemy events.
[1:24:26.760 --> 1:24:32.760]  The Church of Sweden, ah, where the rapes are up multi-hundred percent.
[1:24:32.760 --> 1:24:40.760]  Where Christians have their children taken and are given to these families. All a satanic ceremony.
[1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:50.760]  And that leads us to Sink running for Congress, the young turds, coming out promoting bestiality.
[1:24:50.760 --> 1:24:53.760]  Here it is.
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:25:09.760]  I believe that I am going, if I were the benevolent dictator of the world, I would legalize bestiality where you are giving, where you are a pleasuring animal.
[1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:11.760]  You see what I'm saying?
[1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:18.760]  You are pleasuring the animal. You look at a cute dog, want to give it some food, have it sit in your lap.
[1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:24.760]  Not Sink. He wants to perform. You know what on it.
[1:25:24.760 --> 1:25:30.760]  Now that's who wants to control your life. That's who says I'm the worst person in the world.
[1:25:30.760 --> 1:25:40.760]  Well of course I am. To you demon. I can just envision human expansion through the cosmos. Oh my gosh.
[1:25:40.760 --> 1:25:45.760]  You think these people want that? They want this planet dead mounted on the wall.
[1:25:45.760 --> 1:25:53.760]  Like all those other planets they've destroyed. Are you going to let them do it?
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:58.760]  Let's continue ladies and gentlemen.
[1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:01.760]  Remember Christ said I have other flocks.
[1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:07.760]  Let's continue here ladies and gentlemen. Let's go to the next piece of this.
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:11.760]  This is the latest footage is people go out and confront them.
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:16.760]  Instead of confronting them on the ground they wanted to, oh you're a man saying you're a woman.
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:19.760]  He goes with the, why are you teaching kids how to be horse?
[1:26:19.760 --> 1:26:29.760]  And that's really what this is in career day in Texas and now in Colorado. They're not telling parents when people come to the school
[1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:33.760]  and tell their children I work at a local gay bar, now a pedo bar.
[1:26:33.760 --> 1:26:38.760]  And you need to come learn to dress like a woman and shake your ass for men.
[1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:45.760]  And the school said your children deserve to see this. We're quote grooming them. These are quotes.
[1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:54.760]  And you don't know what's best for them. We do. And then they even go to city council and say it to rub it in your face.
[1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:59.760]  Here's the footage. It's up on info wars.com needs to go viral.
[1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:21.760]  Man confronts drag queen. Here it is.
[1:27:21.760 --> 1:27:29.760]  Let's hit pause. I'm going to come back with more of this on the side but understand these are inside classrooms. This is a classroom.
[1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:33.760]  And these weird women that know what they're in, they're always all freaked out and look crazy.
[1:27:33.760 --> 1:27:41.760]  They bring their kids, the kids like crying in every video and they put them in the weird man's lap as the man sharks up and goes
[1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:52.760]  because they're putting the kid in a demon's lap. This is a ritual. This is a bail ritual. Next it's a big fiery plate.
[1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:56.760]  They burn the children and then rip the meat off it on a big barbecue platter.
[1:27:56.760 --> 1:28:03.760]  Done all over the world. This thing manifests. And so bringing the children and the women are all bozoed out and crazy.
[1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:09.760]  There's portal Desmond with the convicted murderer on video with the Rohibbon on the back with the image of a little girl skipping rope.
[1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:15.760]  It's all we got your kids. We captured them. We got them. We got them.
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:24.760]  And you notice the women automatically when the men stand up and say, hey, this is child abuse, the women go, ah, it's a blackout.
[1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:29.760]  Our communication because they don't want the children to hear and to see men like men are supposed to act.
[1:28:29.760 --> 1:28:32.760]  This is abuse. Don't do this to your children. Don't do it.
[1:28:32.760 --> 1:28:40.760]  The women are like demons over the babies they only had to have their will over, especially the little boys.
[1:28:40.760 --> 1:28:45.760]  They'll how? They'll defeat that male energy. They'll pull it down.
[1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:52.760]  Pieces of spiritual gold they're given by their masters. These people are so dead inside.
[1:28:52.760 --> 1:29:03.760]  The only time they feel alive is when they're draining the energy off children.
[1:29:23.760 --> 1:29:28.760]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists, get back to nature.

[1:29:56.760 --> 1:30:04.760]  The Anti-Defamation League is one of the most powerful, globalist, leftist, anti-American organizations on the face of the planet.
[1:30:04.760 --> 1:30:09.760]  And they have declared that Info Wars is public enemy number one.
[1:30:09.760 --> 1:30:19.760]  They gave Tim Cook of Apple an award specifically for de-platforming me to make sure that tens of millions of people could not hear the show.
[1:30:19.760 --> 1:30:30.760]  And now they've had Sasha Baron Cohen come out and call for the arrest of big tech heads that do not turn full control over to the globalist ADL.
[1:30:30.760 --> 1:30:35.760]  And they've called for a complete purge of anyone promoting Americana.
[1:30:35.760 --> 1:30:44.760]  We are being demoralized, we are being conquered, and the enemy wants to shut Info Wars down because they understand that we've got their number and know how to defeat their paradigm.
[1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:48.760]  You have helped keep us on the air, but now the attacks are more insane than ever.

[1:32:04.760 --> 1:32:12.760]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste, and it doesn't compete with Super Blue.
[1:32:12.760 --> 1:32:17.760]  It's four-to-five-a-cloidal silver and iodine in fluoride-free, the adult or the children's.
[1:32:17.760 --> 1:32:22.760]  These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers. People love it.
[1:32:22.760 --> 1:32:30.760]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above-sea, coral calcium that also cleans, but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[1:32:30.760 --> 1:32:37.760]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that causes ginsivitis. This is all proven.
[1:32:37.760 --> 1:32:50.760]  You can make claims of this, but I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[1:32:50.760 --> 1:33:07.760]  We're really proud of it. It funds the operation in FullWareStore.com. That's why we're still on air. Thanks to you.
[1:33:20.760 --> 1:33:29.760]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:44.760]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:57.760]  So all over the world, governments are funding pedophile storytime where children are groomed and where the first contact with adult men dressed as demonic clowns are made with children.
[1:33:57.760 --> 1:34:05.760]  Now, not all of the men rubbed into this are pedophiles, but a lot of them have turned out are convicted pedophiles. Many of them are supporters of Nambla.
[1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:15.760]  And the groups backing this want the sexualization of children. My God, just look at the Disney films. Look at the different clothing ads. Look at this whole agenda.
[1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:24.760]  And it's invading the churches. It's invading the seminaries. It's taking over the Catholic Church. It's taking over everything.
[1:34:24.760 --> 1:34:29.760]  And then once it fully takes it over, it's too big to fail.
[1:34:29.760 --> 1:34:38.760]  The Pope's right-hand man just got convicted of trafficking hundreds of kidnapped children. It made almost no headlines.
[1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:54.760]  It's the normalization. And notice that in this whole Adam and Eve outfit, if you're a TV viewer, of what goes on inside these churches now where they blaspheme the altars,
[1:34:54.760 --> 1:35:04.760]  that it's all going back to the roots of the seduction, the knowledge of evil, the injection of corruption into society.
[1:35:04.760 --> 1:35:22.760]  And you've got the individual there dressed as the Pharaoh. How is it reported that Adam Schiff dresses when he's at Ed Buck's house where the black men die according to their journals in rituals?
[1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:37.760]  Like a Pharaoh, Alistair Crowley, ladies and gentlemen, it's all open corruption being launched against civilization.
[1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:51.760]  But this video, Man Confronts Drag Queen Story Hour, is very, very important to video and articles up on infowars.com
[1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:58.760]  Because it's not a drag queen. It's a man in a disguise making contact with children with weirdo women, bringing their children to it.
[1:35:58.760 --> 1:36:04.760]  But now more and more, it's not being announced. It's being done in the schools.
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:15.760]  And now from Europe to the United States, they're teaching what Jocelyn Elders tried to launch many, many years ago.
[1:36:15.760 --> 1:36:24.760]  Reaching down and helping the fifth graders and the first graders and the kindergartners, helping them masturbate.
[1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:28.760]  Remember her? People are like, what the hell is this?
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:34.760]  They want the precedent of putting their hands on your children's genitals.
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:41.760]  It's their cult. It's who they are. Everything with them orbits that.
[1:36:41.760 --> 1:36:46.760]  And this is their offensive. This is their takeover.
[1:36:46.760 --> 1:36:53.760]  This is their plan to censor and dominate and control the entire culture.
[1:36:53.760 --> 1:37:02.760]  So let's go ahead and roll more of this video that just broke today. Here it is.
[1:37:02.760 --> 1:37:12.760]  I have a question. What are you going to do when you stand before God and He judges everyone in here for your sins?
[1:37:12.760 --> 1:37:18.760]  What are you going to do when you stand before God and you're judged for your sins?
[1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:21.760]  Because the Bible says this,
[1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:33.760]  but if anyone causes one of my little ones to believe in me to stumble, it would be better that a large millstone be hung around their neck and they'd be drowned in the depths of the sea.
[1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:36.760]  And you're going to stand before God.
[1:37:36.760 --> 1:37:41.760]  And He's going to say to you, what are you going to do when you stand before God and question these kids' minds? What are you going to do then?
[1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:51.760]  God is so in this world that His name is one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish for their everlasting life.
[1:37:51.760 --> 1:37:59.760]  Little kids need to believe in Jesus Christ. The Bible says, suffer not. These little ones need to be raised up in the Lord.
[1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:02.760]  These little ones need to be raised up in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:10.760]  Because it's going to come a day when every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father.
[1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:18.760]  The Bible says that men are men and men are women. And men should be dressed like men.
[1:38:18.760 --> 1:38:24.760]  And women should be dressed like men. This is sin. And the Bible says that the wages of sin cannot be paid.
[1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:27.760]  I'm going to tell you today what you all are doing on the other message.
[1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:29.760]  Are heading for a future judgment.
[1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:32.760]  I think we all have a good way to get it.
[1:38:32.760 --> 1:38:34.760]  And you can. This is another story.
[1:38:34.760 --> 1:38:42.760]  We'll stop right there. We'll play more of this in a moment. A lot of people are going to ask, well, who is this? Why didn't I hear this?
[1:38:42.760 --> 1:38:54.760]  The man is named Dory Love. He had a YouTube channel. We had him on a month ago about work he's doing. His YouTube channel was taken away.
[1:38:54.760 --> 1:39:00.760]  Now there's a new channel that just went up that's got it as well, but they've been taking these down.
[1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:05.760]  Acts 6 for Dory Love D O R R E Love.
[1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:11.760]  So while you can go find the videos and see it for yourself.
[1:39:11.760 --> 1:39:18.760]  You can find the videos that have been taken down. They don't want you to see what they're doing with children.
[1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:21.760]  They don't want you to see.
[1:39:21.760 --> 1:39:41.760]  These are sick, sick, twisted people in my view. And a lot of the others are just brainwashed people that believe this is actually about tolerance and including people to bring their children who are scared to sit on the laps of men dressed up like bizarre demonic clowns.
[1:39:41.760 --> 1:40:06.760]  But you notice it's a white man behind the camera and then it's a black man in front of the camera. And it's that idea of people working together, not off of what color we are, but what is right and standing up for truth and justice.
[1:40:06.760 --> 1:40:15.760]  And that's something that really frustrates me is how we end up spending so much of our time because the globalist create racial division and cultural division and make us fight with each other.
[1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:19.760]  And groups do come against you because of what color you are.
[1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:26.760]  But it's divide and conquer. They're manipulating the whole thing while children of every race, color and creed are being aborted. They're being killed after they're born.
[1:40:26.760 --> 1:40:37.760]  They're being abused. They're being put through this evil system of hopelessness and being removed from God and being isolated so these demons can have their way with them.
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:42.760]  And that's why the man points out it's better for you to tie a millstone around your neck and throw yourself in the deep ocean than to harm one of these children.
[1:40:42.760 --> 1:40:52.760]  Why are you here? He dressed like a whore teaching children this. It's creepy. It's sick. You don't dress your daughters up like that when they're little girls.
[1:40:52.760 --> 1:41:02.760]  It's like the creepy beauty patches of little girls. This is next level past that. And everybody knows what it is.
[1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:15.760]  And that sync video from the young Turks where he's talking about how much he wants to pleasure animals. I mean, and he gets that crazy look in their eye. These are degenerate, crazy people.
[1:41:15.760 --> 1:41:21.760]  Let's finish up the video in Canada. Here it is.
[1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:23.760]  Hello everybody.
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:26.760]  We're heading for spiritual punishment.
[1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:30.760]  Looking for wicked ways to get it.
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:37.760]  The Lord has sent me here today to tell you how to turn from your wicked ways over a pit before God and you're going to be judged.
[1:41:37.760 --> 1:42:01.760]  And you're going to be judged.
[1:42:01.760 --> 1:42:28.760]  Again these are mothers in a school bringing their children to sit on the lap of a six foot three man dressed like a woman
[1:42:28.760 --> 1:42:36.760]  and again in Canada they're trying to arrest people that engage in their Christian faith and say they don't like this
[1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:44.760]  and the video you just saw has been taken down well it's gonna live at band.video thanks for all your support
[1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:51.760]  I hope you all share it now I'm gonna shift gears out of all this and I'm gonna get into all the other news I haven't gotten to
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:43:00.760]  just stay with us we'll be right back I've made a lot of predictions that have come true but I'm here to tell you
[1:43:00.760 --> 1:43:07.760]  most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball I could see where the globalists were going
[1:43:07.760 --> 1:43:15.760]  I could see what their in-game agenda was what their goal was and I knew that when they were setting us up to be deplatformed
[1:43:15.760 --> 1:43:24.760]  that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air to silence everyone to ban words and names
[1:43:24.760 --> 1:43:30.760]  and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed
[1:43:30.760 --> 1:43:36.760]  what the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future
[1:43:36.760 --> 1:43:41.760]  it was the model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced
[1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:47.760]  because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed
[1:43:47.760 --> 1:43:55.760]  and that's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever
[1:43:55.760 --> 1:44:07.760]  a question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson what is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to
[1:44:07.760 --> 1:44:16.760]  how far will they go what's their limit and he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit
[1:44:16.760 --> 1:44:22.760]  the answer is there is no limit to evil it is a bottomless pit
[1:44:22.760 --> 1:44:31.760]  we've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will there's no devil or the god
[1:44:31.760 --> 1:44:40.760]  but those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live
[1:44:40.760 --> 1:44:46.760]  and what our houses can be like they just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us
[1:44:46.760 --> 1:44:51.760]  Oxford's banned clapping universities in the US have banned 21 gun salutes for veterans
[1:44:51.760 --> 1:44:55.760]  these people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them
[1:44:55.760 --> 1:45:02.760]  Black Friday is here and the sales are so numerous there is no way to go over all of them
[1:45:02.760 --> 1:45:08.760]  but let me just give you an example of some of the sales we have running right now
[1:45:08.760 --> 1:45:18.760]  DNA Force plus our flagship product 50% off free shipping triple patriot points that's 15% off on your next order

[1:45:25.760 --> 1:45:32.760]  I'm offering a free bottle of brain force plus our number one best selling product so that those of you that haven't tried it
[1:45:32.760 --> 1:45:40.760]  can see how it gives you clean focused mental stamina is the term that I use with none of the hangovers
[1:45:40.760 --> 1:45:50.760]  again that's just one of the sales going right now 50% off free shipping triple patriot points free bottle of brain force plus
[1:45:50.760 --> 1:45:57.760]  with DNA force plus at m4store.com please take action and fund this operation
[1:45:57.760 --> 1:46:03.760]  Beto Rourke came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi automatic rifles
[1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:11.760]  and he got all the other Democrats on the stage nine others to agree and said that he was a hero think about that
[1:46:11.760 --> 1:46:17.760]  now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control their blue cities are literal crap holes
[1:46:17.760 --> 1:46:26.760]  covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime they know what they're doing
[1:46:26.760 --> 1:46:34.760]  and now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms
[1:46:34.760 --> 1:46:41.760]  my goodness ladies and gentlemen this country's under such incredible attack but more and more towns and cities are saying
[1:46:41.760 --> 1:46:46.760]  they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution
[1:46:46.760 --> 1:46:52.760]  and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns so you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens
[1:46:52.760 --> 1:46:57.760]  well we can ignore all your unconstitutional laws
[1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:32.760]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[1:47:32.760 --> 1:47:35.760]  okay
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:46.760]  let me lay out what's coming up the next hour
[1:47:46.760 --> 1:47:54.760]  right now I'm going to hit big developments with the world system in the casual society that have officially now been announced
[1:47:54.760 --> 1:48:02.760]  you're going to say we already knew this but it's now been announced it's official
[1:48:02.760 --> 1:48:11.760]  and there's been really big Epstein developments reportedly a bunch of hidden video part of his blackmail operation that he had stored on computers
[1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:16.760]  obviously elements of the government have that Trump has that
[1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:24.760]  reportedly folks connected to Eric Prince have that and that is set to be coming out
[1:48:24.760 --> 1:48:31.760]  devastating footage that's why you see all this media stuff about oh deep fakes get ready for deep fakes
[1:48:31.760 --> 1:48:40.760]  they can make deep fakes 30 years ago CG it's just cheaper now these aren't going to be deep fakes
[1:48:40.760 --> 1:48:51.760]  imagine when the footage of Bill Clinton raping little girls and little boys reportedly hits the internet
[1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:56.760]  and they're going to say it's a deep fake
[1:48:56.760 --> 1:49:02.760]  I can feel God's vengeance building up
[1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:08.760]  like a tremor before the giant earthquake
[1:49:08.760 --> 1:49:14.760]  and my spirit trembles
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:17.760]  but not with fear
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:25.760]  with pure focused rage and destruction
[1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:31.760]  I'm tuned into God I know you are too and I can feel it I've got to control myself
[1:49:31.760 --> 1:49:39.760]  you think you're pissed about evil you think you think you're mad about what's happening to children imagine God has to sit there and watch all of it
[1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:47.760]  and feel those children's pain and Christ had to take all of that sent on that it happened before at present and into the future
[1:49:47.760 --> 1:49:51.760]  because it wouldn't be fair if God didn't take it on would it
[1:49:51.760 --> 1:49:58.760]  God is so just so good took it on felt every bit of it
[1:49:58.760 --> 1:50:06.760]  feel that that's just one one trillionth of what God's gone through
[1:50:06.760 --> 1:50:15.760]  to have the will to create his children to have the will to then test those children
[1:50:15.760 --> 1:50:26.760]  that's will that's the power that created the universe that's God unstoppable will unstoppable depth
[1:50:26.760 --> 1:50:35.760]  and containable all mighty all time all space all dimensions
[1:50:35.760 --> 1:50:39.760]  unlimited
[1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:44.760]  think the enemy likes that no they don't
[1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:52.760]  and that's why all the enemy can do is deform and sabotage
[1:50:52.760 --> 1:50:57.760]  let me get into the news on China and boys are a lot of it
[1:50:57.760 --> 1:51:01.760]  because it ties into all of this technocracy but let me just get this out
[1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:11.760]  people are tribal and we're ritualistic and we all like to follow rituals that are laid down I'm a traditionalist myself
[1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:19.760]  and tradition tends to be good that's why we clutch on to it
[1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:25.760]  and black Friday is a day when people do their spending here
[1:51:25.760 --> 1:51:29.760]  and then that allows us to fund ourselves into the next year under globalist attack
[1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:38.760]  that siphons off a lot of the capital that we would use to get our work done
[1:51:38.760 --> 1:51:43.760]  but then I did Friday show that is usually the biggest day of the year for us
[1:51:43.760 --> 1:51:54.760]  and I plug less than I do on a regular show because that's just how I work and I'm trying to change that
[1:51:54.760 --> 1:51:58.760]  now today is one of the biggest days of the year after black Friday cyber Monday
[1:51:58.760 --> 1:52:05.760]  you heard me do a one minute plug last hour every other talk show is just constant plugging during and I get it to pay their bills
[1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:10.760]  because it's such an over saturation of advertising and such an over saturation of media
[1:52:10.760 --> 1:52:16.760]  but we're not that media we're the media the globalists want shut down because we've cracked the code
[1:52:16.760 --> 1:52:20.760]  thanks to you and your prayers and your support literally
[1:52:20.760 --> 1:52:26.760]  so let me do some catching up here and I'm not going to give you the whole breakdown but I mean
[1:52:26.760 --> 1:52:31.760]  I'm not going to spend time getting into what the enemy is doing or how they're railroading us and what they're up to
[1:52:31.760 --> 1:52:38.760]  and I'm not going to tell the enemy what I'm up to but believe me what you see here on the surface is the surface
[1:52:38.760 --> 1:52:51.760]  and yes as it is above to use one of the old terms of hermetic alchemy so below
[1:52:51.760 --> 1:53:02.760]  but believe me I'm a busy beaver and if the NWO thinks they're going to shut me down
[1:53:02.760 --> 1:53:08.760]  without putting me in prison or killing me they got another thing coming but it's hard for me
[1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:16.760]  to do the things that need to be done that you don't see but you will see without money
[1:53:16.760 --> 1:53:20.760]  I have to then scrounge around and I have to spend half my time raising money
[1:53:20.760 --> 1:53:24.760]  back in the day when I could just raise any amount of money I wanted to I barely even did it
[1:53:24.760 --> 1:53:29.760]  I should have been busy and put away nuts like a squirrel does or like the ant does and not a grasshopper
[1:53:29.760 --> 1:53:32.760]  but I've just never really been worried about that
[1:53:32.760 --> 1:53:37.760]  I need a lot of funds and you need this operation to be heavily funded
[1:53:37.760 --> 1:53:43.760]  so that I can easily do the things I need to do I need more reporters I need more camera people
[1:53:43.760 --> 1:53:48.760]  in the past I've funded a lot of other people's operations with no strings attached
[1:53:48.760 --> 1:53:53.760]  I'm not able to write those checks anymore I never wanted the credit but I've written hundreds
[1:53:53.760 --> 1:53:58.760]  and hundreds of checks that have funded a lot of the groups you see out there
[1:53:58.760 --> 1:54:08.760]  and we're now just simply trying to develop some new projects that I don't own and that I don't control
[1:54:08.760 --> 1:54:17.760]  so that one way or another we have platforms to continue on when the censorship is going to get so bad
[1:54:17.760 --> 1:54:24.760]  because of Trump's failure to do something about it that those that are able to stay in a position
[1:54:24.760 --> 1:54:29.760]  with radio and TV uplinks and other systems we've gotten place are going to be able to critically
[1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:33.760]  change the destiny of the planet we've already changed the destiny together
[1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:39.760]  we've already proven we know what we're doing we've already won major races to use a race car analogy
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:45.760]  we've already won the big races we've already gotten the checkered flag now they're trying to sabotage their car
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:52.760]  and they've got their gremlins coming after it hey other cars are being built
[1:54:52.760 --> 1:54:59.760]  okay and I'm just going to leave it at that if they think they're keeping me off the track not happening
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:06.760]  not happening but you want to break some globalist ribs you want to crush some skulls politically
[1:55:06.760 --> 1:55:15.760]  you want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually there's nowhere you can spend money
[1:55:15.760 --> 1:55:24.760]  there's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar
[1:55:24.760 --> 1:55:34.760]  your bang for your buck here gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system
[1:55:34.760 --> 1:55:40.760]  where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy and so it's very simple
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:47.760]  if you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy which God wants to see
[1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:53.760]  you see we have to make the effort 110% God will finish the move
[1:55:53.760 --> 1:55:57.760]  and I went and saw the movie Midway it's excellent because it's very historically based
[1:55:57.760 --> 1:56:02.760]  and there's a submarine attack I'm going to give a bright notes history that actually held up the Japanese fleet
[1:56:02.760 --> 1:56:06.760]  long enough for the rest of them to discover them and get them and sink them
[1:56:06.760 --> 1:56:12.760]  their torpedoes didn't hit folks but that submarine is what made them win that
[1:56:12.760 --> 1:56:16.760]  and then probably when that whole leg of the war would have lasted probably five years longer
[1:56:16.760 --> 1:56:19.760]  if Midway wouldn't have happened that way
[1:56:19.760 --> 1:56:23.760]  and by the way this submarine has already blown up a bunch of ships before
[1:56:23.760 --> 1:56:28.760]  it's not like we're shooting torpedoes and holding them back and making them use a war analogy
[1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:34.760]  and then down the road has an effect we've already sent the enemy to the bottom over and over again
[1:56:34.760 --> 1:56:39.760]  they know that and I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack attack attack
[1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:43.760]  I want to attack I want to go after the globalist
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:50.760]  and so I'm going to get up off my ass and come up with other ways for you to support us
[1:56:50.760 --> 1:56:53.760]  and I'll announce that in the next week or two there's no more time to wait
[1:56:53.760 --> 1:56:57.760]  we've only got 336 days and they've held me up a few years and things I wanted to launch
[1:56:57.760 --> 1:57:00.760]  but I've got a lot of irons in the fire and a lot of stuff going on
[1:57:00.760 --> 1:57:04.760]  and just believe me ladies and gentlemen that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight
[1:57:04.760 --> 1:57:08.760]  for all of our futures together you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game
[1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:11.760]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I've got for us
[1:57:11.760 --> 1:57:14.760]  for myself and my family and for your family because we're in this together
[1:57:14.760 --> 1:57:17.760]  we are in this together but the Cyber Monday specials are here
[1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:20.760]  it's the big Black Friday sales, the triple page rip points
[1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:26.760]  free shipping, giant sales, free bottles of Brain Force Plus with the DNA Force Plus
[1:57:26.760 --> 1:57:28.760]  and with the X2 and X3 and a bunch of other huge specials
[1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:30.760]  stuff that was sold out back in stock
[1:57:30.760 --> 1:57:32.760]  these specials are going to have to end sometime this week
[1:57:32.760 --> 1:57:36.760]  well that's their new specials but they won't be as massive or as wide reaching
[1:57:36.760 --> 1:57:39.760]  but whatever you do, fund the info war and I salute you and I thank you
[1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:42.760]  alright we'll get into the whole Mark of the Beast system and so much more
[1:57:42.760 --> 1:58:09.760]  we come back, stay with us
[1:58:42.760 --> 1:58:46.760]  infowarsore.com
[1:59:13.760 --> 1:59:16.760]  you've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third party test out there
[1:59:16.760 --> 1:59:18.760]  the air filtration, the water filtration
[1:59:18.760 --> 1:59:21.760]  the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there
[1:59:21.760 --> 1:59:27.760]  and you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard
[1:59:27.760 --> 1:59:31.760]  so it's not a burden to support info wars
[1:59:31.760 --> 1:59:36.760]  it really is something that is good for everybody
[1:59:36.760 --> 1:59:38.760]  that stands for justice and freedom

[1:59:42.760 --> 2:00:09.760]  so visit infowarsore.com today
[2:00:13.760 --> 2:00:19.760]  my brain was racing so fast and so hard this morning
[2:00:19.760 --> 2:00:21.760]  that I couldn't go on air
[2:00:21.760 --> 2:00:25.760]  and I'm not complaining
[2:00:25.760 --> 2:00:28.760]  I'm explaining to you just so you as a listener
[2:00:28.760 --> 2:00:31.760]  as part of this family understand why in the future
[2:00:31.760 --> 2:00:34.760]  things are not going to be the way they've been
[2:00:34.760 --> 2:00:37.760]  and when we kick some ass I'm just telling you I'm going to the next level
[2:00:37.760 --> 2:00:41.760]  or I won't be on air
[2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:43.760]  I'm serious this is life and death
[2:00:43.760 --> 2:00:46.760]  I'm going to up our game 100% at least
[2:00:46.760 --> 2:00:48.760]  or I'm done
[2:00:48.760 --> 2:00:50.760]  because I'm not going to do this half-ass
[2:00:50.760 --> 2:00:53.760]  I'm not going to go into this fight
[2:00:53.760 --> 2:01:02.760]  at 95% I'm going to go into this 100% swinging to tear heads off
[2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:07.760]  and I was going to start the show explaining this is what it's going to be like
[2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:11.760]  in the information singularity
[2:01:11.760 --> 2:01:15.760]  is a lot of cascades of many singularities
[2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:23.760]  towards the bigger singularity
[2:01:23.760 --> 2:01:25.760]  and already with the censorship
[2:01:25.760 --> 2:01:29.760]  we are reaching the censorship singularity
[2:01:29.760 --> 2:01:37.760]  and that was such an epic catharsis
[2:01:37.760 --> 2:01:40.760]  epiphany
[2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:42.760]  crystallization
[2:01:42.760 --> 2:01:44.760]  clarity
[2:01:44.760 --> 2:01:46.760]  infinity clear
[2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:49.760]  when I thought about that Friday
[2:01:49.760 --> 2:01:52.760]  and that's just such an epic understanding of that
[2:01:52.760 --> 2:01:54.760]  and we can all see it
[2:01:54.760 --> 2:01:58.760]  that's a whole other subject
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:02:00.760]  the censorship singularity
[2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:05.760]  that we're now entering
[2:02:05.760 --> 2:02:08.760]  what that really means
[2:02:08.760 --> 2:02:10.760]  because censorship isn't the right word
[2:02:10.760 --> 2:02:12.760]  it's total information singularity
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:17.760]  well what does the information singularity mean?
[2:02:17.760 --> 2:02:20.760]  people think oh that means all the information in the world
[2:02:20.760 --> 2:02:31.760]  but no it means no information
[2:02:31.760 --> 2:02:34.760]  and so I'm sitting here
[2:02:34.760 --> 2:02:36.760]  at the junction point
[2:02:36.760 --> 2:02:38.760]  of all this information coming in
[2:02:38.760 --> 2:02:41.760]  you wonder why presidents all their hair goes gray like that
[2:02:41.760 --> 2:02:43.760]  it's that responsibility
[2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:45.760]  well this is something akin to that
[2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:47.760]  for all of us that care
[2:02:47.760 --> 2:02:49.760]  because I was thinking about this audience of activists
[2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:50.760]  you're not an audience
[2:02:50.760 --> 2:02:51.760]  you are men in the arena
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:52.760]  guys I always butcher
[2:02:52.760 --> 2:02:55.760]  you print me the man in the arena
[2:02:55.760 --> 2:02:57.760]  thing again thanks
[2:02:57.760 --> 2:03:00.760]  and it hit me that
[2:03:00.760 --> 2:03:02.760]  we're not building up enough
[2:03:02.760 --> 2:03:04.760]  how incredible this time is
[2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:07.760]  and how dangerous but also fortuitous
[2:03:07.760 --> 2:03:09.760]  and just how amazing it is
[2:03:09.760 --> 2:03:11.760]  and how incredible it is
[2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:15.760]  that info wars has been at the center of it
[2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:18.760]  because you are the people that care
[2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:22.760]  you're the people that saw what was happening far away
[2:03:22.760 --> 2:03:23.760]  now it's here
[2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:29.760]  you're the people that are in touch with God
[2:03:29.760 --> 2:03:33.760]  and so the fact that this broadcast is even on the air
[2:03:33.760 --> 2:03:37.760]  is what drives the globalist insane
[2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:41.760]  again back in the day of real journalists
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:43.760]  big journalists would work with teams of people
[2:03:43.760 --> 2:03:52.760]  for several months on one story we cover today
[2:03:52.760 --> 2:03:54.760]  and people say well how could you make a decision so quick
[2:03:54.760 --> 2:03:55.760]  on a story and no
[2:03:55.760 --> 2:03:56.760]  well we make mistakes sometimes
[2:03:56.760 --> 2:04:00.760]  we're accurate about 97% of the time
[2:04:00.760 --> 2:04:01.760]  because I'll look at a story
[2:04:01.760 --> 2:04:03.760]  and I'm not just going off that one
[2:04:03.760 --> 2:04:05.760]  I've got a whole lexicon of other reports
[2:04:05.760 --> 2:04:07.760]  and things that I know in the background
[2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:09.760]  and what's been done in other countries and other places
[2:04:09.760 --> 2:04:11.760]  and when I see something I know what it's going to be
[2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:13.760]  and then I read it and it's that
[2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:15.760]  and then I can even see the roll out of it in my mind
[2:04:15.760 --> 2:04:17.760]  and then I see it roll out
[2:04:17.760 --> 2:04:20.760]  and then when I finally see it roll out
[2:04:20.760 --> 2:04:22.760]  and it's bad and I knew it was coming
[2:04:22.760 --> 2:04:25.760]  it's like watching a punch come at you in slow motion
[2:04:25.760 --> 2:04:28.760]  it's this feeling of if we have this knowledge
[2:04:28.760 --> 2:04:31.760]  we should be able to stop this
[2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:33.760]  if we have revelation
[2:04:33.760 --> 2:04:38.760]  but you can't stop it if other people don't have the revelation
[2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:41.760]  you can't tell them about the matrix
[2:04:41.760 --> 2:04:43.760]  they've got to see the matrix
[2:04:43.760 --> 2:04:45.760]  it's true
[2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:47.760]  because it's a spirit
[2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:48.760]  it's a download
[2:04:48.760 --> 2:04:49.760]  it's a communion
[2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:51.760]  and they don't have it
[2:04:51.760 --> 2:04:53.760]  because they're lost
[2:04:55.760 --> 2:04:59.760]  a question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson
[2:04:59.760 --> 2:05:03.760]  what is the level of tyranny
[2:05:03.760 --> 2:05:07.760]  that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[2:05:07.760 --> 2:05:09.760]  how far will they go? what's their limit?
[2:05:09.760 --> 2:05:13.760]  and he said it is the limit to which other men and women
[2:05:13.760 --> 2:05:15.760]  will submit
[2:05:15.760 --> 2:05:19.760]  the answer is there is no limit to evil
[2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:22.760]  it is a bottomless pit
[2:05:22.760 --> 2:05:27.760]  we've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist
[2:05:27.760 --> 2:05:29.760]  or that there's no free will
[2:05:29.760 --> 2:05:31.760]  there's no devil or the god
[2:05:31.760 --> 2:05:34.760]  but those very same people have all these rules for us about
[2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:37.760]  speech and how we can dress
[2:05:37.760 --> 2:05:39.760]  and where we can live
[2:05:39.760 --> 2:05:41.760]  and what our houses can be like
[2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:43.760]  they just don't want us to have any values
[2:05:43.760 --> 2:05:45.760]  so they can run over us
[2:05:45.760 --> 2:05:47.760]  Oxford's band clapping
[2:05:47.760 --> 2:05:50.760]  universities in the US have banned 21 guns to loot for veterans
[2:05:50.760 --> 2:05:52.760]  these people are dangerous cult leaders
[2:05:52.760 --> 2:06:09.760]  and it's time to reject them
[2:06:09.760 --> 2:06:13.760]  I was just thinking about, kind of cue it up again
[2:06:13.760 --> 2:06:17.760]  the look on sink of the young church
[2:06:17.760 --> 2:06:21.760]  when he talks about pleasuring animals
[2:06:21.760 --> 2:06:27.760]  and he gets this look in his eye of just absolute pervert glee
[2:06:27.760 --> 2:06:32.760]  and this is the guy promoting pedophile story time with his children
[2:06:32.760 --> 2:06:36.760]  this is the guy that calls me the most horrible person in the world
[2:06:36.760 --> 2:06:39.760]  well, yeah, to a damn demon like you
[2:06:39.760 --> 2:06:41.760]  I bet I'm the worst person in the world
[2:06:41.760 --> 2:06:44.760]  I take that as a compliment, you slug
[2:06:44.760 --> 2:06:46.760]  good god
[2:06:46.760 --> 2:06:49.760]  and see, we just don't imagine they want to have sex with animals
[2:06:49.760 --> 2:06:51.760]  sex with your kids
[2:06:51.760 --> 2:06:53.760]  they want to do evil things
[2:06:53.760 --> 2:06:58.760]  they want to put round pegs and square holes
[2:06:58.760 --> 2:07:00.760]  they want to put five eyeballs on things
[2:07:00.760 --> 2:07:02.760]  and arms sticking out of the side of your head
[2:07:02.760 --> 2:07:05.760]  why? because it's aberrant
[2:07:05.760 --> 2:07:07.760]  it's demonic
[2:07:07.760 --> 2:07:10.760]  it's a failure, it doesn't work
[2:07:10.760 --> 2:07:15.760]  it's not satisfying because they are not satisfied
[2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:17.760]  they're lost
[2:07:17.760 --> 2:07:22.760]  because they get a thrill out of rebelling against the programming
[2:07:25.760 --> 2:07:27.760]  that's it
[2:07:27.760 --> 2:07:29.760]  it's very, very simple
[2:07:29.760 --> 2:07:32.760]  and these people will bring our civilization down so fast
[2:07:32.760 --> 2:07:34.760]  it'll make your head spin
[2:07:34.760 --> 2:07:36.760]  let's go ahead and play sink
[2:07:36.760 --> 2:07:38.760]  and if you're a radio listener, you're lucky
[2:07:38.760 --> 2:07:40.760]  you don't have to look at this guy
[2:07:40.760 --> 2:07:42.760]  he looks like
[2:07:42.760 --> 2:07:45.760]  you know, when you and your buddy are sitting there in college
[2:07:45.760 --> 2:07:47.760]  and this super gorgeous chick walks in
[2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:50.760]  and the door opens and her skirt blows just perfect
[2:07:50.760 --> 2:07:52.760]  like Marilyn Monroe
[2:07:52.760 --> 2:07:55.760]  and you're just like, oh man, whoa
[2:07:55.760 --> 2:07:58.760]  it's like, she's so gorgeous, it's painful
[2:07:58.760 --> 2:08:00.760]  I mean, there's just a total yearning
[2:08:00.760 --> 2:08:04.760]  it's not even sexual, you're just admiring this beautiful creature
[2:08:06.760 --> 2:08:08.760]  that's the look he's got on his face
[2:08:08.760 --> 2:08:10.760]  talking about pleasuring your cat or your dog
[2:08:10.760 --> 2:08:12.760]  or I guess your, you know, vice TV
[2:08:12.760 --> 2:08:16.760]  sex with earthworms, sex with children, I mean
[2:08:19.760 --> 2:08:21.760]  oh, but men and women, oh, that's all rape
[2:08:21.760 --> 2:08:25.760]  and that's all bad and that's all clouded and under attack
[2:08:25.760 --> 2:08:28.760]  because that's powerful and that's real
[2:08:30.760 --> 2:08:32.760]  that's fulfilling
[2:08:36.760 --> 2:08:38.760]  and see, now it's, oh no, no
[2:08:38.760 --> 2:08:40.760]  let you have sex with your earthworms
[2:08:40.760 --> 2:08:42.760]  you poor dog
[2:08:42.760 --> 2:08:44.760]  you're gonna rape your dog
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:47.760]  like I'm telling you, that's his new congressional tagline
[2:08:47.760 --> 2:08:50.760]  sex coming, lock up your animals
[2:08:51.760 --> 2:08:53.760]  sex coming
[2:08:56.760 --> 2:08:59.760]  sync uger, how do you say his name?
[2:09:02.760 --> 2:09:05.760]  sync wuger, he's got a heart on for your dog
[2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:09.760]  I mean, that's who these people are
[2:09:09.760 --> 2:09:11.760]  let's go ahead and roll video of him
[2:09:11.760 --> 2:09:13.760]  lusting over your animals, here it is
[2:09:14.760 --> 2:09:17.760]  I believe that I am going, I, if I were the rule
[2:09:17.760 --> 2:09:19.760]  the benevolent dictator of the world
[2:09:19.760 --> 2:09:22.760]  I would legalize
[2:09:22.760 --> 2:09:25.760]  bestiality where you are
[2:09:25.760 --> 2:09:27.760]  giving
[2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:30.760]  you are, you are pleasuring the animal
[2:09:30.760 --> 2:09:32.760]  you see what I'm saying?
[2:09:32.760 --> 2:09:34.760]  you are pleasuring
[2:09:34.760 --> 2:09:36.760]  the animal
[2:09:36.760 --> 2:09:39.760]  and he gives the person off camera a look
[2:09:39.760 --> 2:09:41.760]  like you're across the table with a candle
[2:09:41.760 --> 2:09:44.760]  drinking some piquante in a Italian restaurant
[2:09:44.760 --> 2:09:46.760]  with a girl you really like
[2:09:46.760 --> 2:09:48.760]  and you're never been with her before
[2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:50.760]  and you're looking at her and you're like
[2:09:50.760 --> 2:09:52.760]  you know, you really are gorgeous
[2:09:52.760 --> 2:09:54.760]  I just, I'm not about you turning some of you on
[2:09:54.760 --> 2:09:56.760]  I've never been turning them before in my life
[2:09:56.760 --> 2:09:58.760]  can I give him that look?
[2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:00.760]  let's just skip dinner and get in the car
[2:10:00.760 --> 2:10:02.760]  and go home right now
[2:10:02.760 --> 2:10:04.760]  he's giving the person off camera that look
[2:10:04.760 --> 2:10:06.760]  he talks about
[2:10:06.760 --> 2:10:08.760]  I can pleasure the animal
[2:10:08.760 --> 2:10:10.760]  oh
[2:10:10.760 --> 2:10:12.760]  that's who this guy is
[2:10:12.760 --> 2:10:14.760]  if he was, he's up there
[2:10:14.760 --> 2:10:17.760]  if I was dictator, this guy's always talking about that
[2:10:17.760 --> 2:10:20.760]  if I was dictator of the world
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:22.760]  I'd screw your cat
[2:10:24.760 --> 2:10:26.760]  he gives new meaning to the guy's got to look on his face
[2:10:26.760 --> 2:10:28.760]  like he just pumped your dog
[2:10:30.760 --> 2:10:32.760]  and you're like, why?
[2:10:32.760 --> 2:10:34.760]  why does he want to have sex with your pelican?
[2:10:36.760 --> 2:10:38.760]  your aardvark
[2:10:38.760 --> 2:10:40.760]  your rhinoceros
[2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:42.760]  your donkey
[2:10:42.760 --> 2:10:44.760]  get out of my swamp
[2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:46.760]  donkey
[2:10:46.760 --> 2:10:48.760]  okay, I'm gonna open the phones up
[2:10:48.760 --> 2:10:50.760]  in the fourth hour today
[2:10:50.760 --> 2:10:52.760]  by the way
[2:10:52.760 --> 2:10:54.760]  David Ike's not been on the show
[2:10:54.760 --> 2:10:56.760]  in two years
[2:10:58.760 --> 2:11:00.760]  and I think that's because
[2:11:00.760 --> 2:11:02.760]  he's been a little mad at me
[2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:04.760]  for being on the Trump train
[2:11:06.760 --> 2:11:08.760]  I mean, yeah, the globalists are totally pissed at Trump
[2:11:08.760 --> 2:11:10.760]  Trump's done a lot of good stuff
[2:11:10.760 --> 2:11:12.760]  but I get Trump's got some problems
[2:11:12.760 --> 2:11:14.760]  and
[2:11:14.760 --> 2:11:16.760]  I just know, suddenly
[2:11:16.760 --> 2:11:18.760]  David Ike
[2:11:18.760 --> 2:11:20.760]  will come on tomorrow
[2:11:20.760 --> 2:11:22.760]  for two hours
[2:11:22.760 --> 2:11:24.760]  and so I really look forward to having him on
[2:11:26.760 --> 2:11:28.760]  a very misunderstood guy
[2:11:28.760 --> 2:11:30.760]  very controversial guy
[2:11:30.760 --> 2:11:32.760]  very interesting fellow, very smart fellow
[2:11:32.760 --> 2:11:34.760]  he said a lot of things 20 years ago
[2:11:34.760 --> 2:11:36.760]  that I thought were crazy that ended up being true
[2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:38.760]  I just hope he's wrong about the rest of it
[2:11:38.760 --> 2:11:40.760]  but you know
[2:11:40.760 --> 2:11:42.760]  these people sure act like
[2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:44.760]  what he says they are
[2:11:44.760 --> 2:11:46.760]  sure explains a lot
[2:11:46.760 --> 2:11:48.760]  I just go with what I can prove
[2:11:48.760 --> 2:11:50.760]  what I can prove is self
[2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:52.760]  out there, I can't even hardly believe it
[2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:54.760]  so we'll go down the rabbit hole
[2:11:54.760 --> 2:11:56.760]  and then some
[2:11:56.760 --> 2:11:58.760]  with David Ike, two hours
[2:11:58.760 --> 2:12:00.760]  tomorrow
[2:12:00.760 --> 2:12:02.760]  he was the first guy I told me
[2:12:02.760 --> 2:12:04.760]  first interview David like 23 years ago
[2:12:04.760 --> 2:12:06.760]  well he was the biggest interview you could get
[2:12:06.760 --> 2:12:08.760]  23 years ago, still one of the biggest
[2:12:08.760 --> 2:12:10.760]  and
[2:12:10.760 --> 2:12:12.760]  I remember
[2:12:16.760 --> 2:12:18.760]  he was like off air telling me
[2:12:18.760 --> 2:12:20.760]  and then a couple years later went to a conference like 20 years ago
[2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:26.760]  at dinner with him
[2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:28.760]  and he was like
[2:12:28.760 --> 2:12:30.760]  well this prime minister
[2:12:30.760 --> 2:12:32.760]  like to have 7 year old girls
[2:12:32.760 --> 2:12:34.760]  with black hair and green eyes
[2:12:34.760 --> 2:12:36.760]  so it's very hard for them to kidnap them
[2:12:36.760 --> 2:12:38.760]  they'd search all over, you're up to get them
[2:12:38.760 --> 2:12:40.760]  and then they'd have trouble getting them up there
[2:12:40.760 --> 2:12:42.760]  then they'd bring them in and they'd put plastic down
[2:12:42.760 --> 2:12:44.760]  and then one guy would slit the throat
[2:12:44.760 --> 2:12:46.760]  and then this particular prime minister didn't have sex with the girls
[2:12:46.760 --> 2:12:48.760]  he would just masturbate while they did it
[2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:50.760]  20 years later
[2:12:50.760 --> 2:12:52.760]  that came out in the newspaper
[2:12:56.760 --> 2:12:58.760]  I mean, slitting little girls' throats
[2:12:58.760 --> 2:13:00.760]  watching their blood spray everywhere
[2:13:00.760 --> 2:13:02.760]  I mean look, I don't want to have to talk about this
[2:13:02.760 --> 2:13:04.760]  they're doing it
[2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:06.760]  you're like why would they do that
[2:13:06.760 --> 2:13:08.760]  because they're into themselves, okay
[2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:10.760]  they like the feeling of the power
[2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:12.760]  here's a beautiful little girl
[2:13:12.760 --> 2:13:14.760]  has the whole future of the universe of before
[2:13:14.760 --> 2:13:16.760]  she is magic, she is powerful
[2:13:16.760 --> 2:13:18.760]  let's murder her
[2:13:18.760 --> 2:13:20.760]  because we're into ourselves
[2:13:20.760 --> 2:13:22.760]  because you and I won't do anything to stop them
[2:13:22.760 --> 2:13:24.760]  because we either
[2:13:24.760 --> 2:13:26.760]  can't believe what's going on
[2:13:26.760 --> 2:13:28.760]  or we're too busy playing golf
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:30.760]  or polishing our
[2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:32.760]  watches
[2:13:32.760 --> 2:13:34.760]  or whatever it is guys are into
[2:13:36.760 --> 2:13:38.760]  and there's nothing wrong with golfing
[2:13:38.760 --> 2:13:40.760]  there's nothing wrong with polishing your watches
[2:13:40.760 --> 2:13:42.760]  but that's not on the hierarchy very high up
[2:13:42.760 --> 2:13:44.760]  you know, you do that
[2:13:44.760 --> 2:13:46.760]  once you've destroyed the globalist
[2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:48.760]  and routed the pedophiles
[2:13:48.760 --> 2:13:50.760]  and made them hide under rocks again
[2:13:50.760 --> 2:13:52.760]  that's when you go play golf and have a Miller light
[2:13:54.760 --> 2:13:56.760]  you don't do it
[2:13:56.760 --> 2:13:58.760]  when all hell's breaking loose
[2:13:58.760 --> 2:14:00.760]  and they're coming for our damn kids
[2:14:00.760 --> 2:14:02.760]  and have already got unlimited numbers of them
[2:14:04.760 --> 2:14:06.760]  I'm gonna stop right there
[2:14:06.760 --> 2:14:08.760]  I said I'd cover all the news and I will cover
[2:14:08.760 --> 2:14:10.760]  all the news
[2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:12.760]  I'll cover it all
[2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:16.760]  David Ike told me there were
[2:14:16.760 --> 2:14:18.760]  Delaware's first killing kids
[2:14:18.760 --> 2:14:20.760]  General Parton told me there were Delaware's first killing kids
[2:14:20.760 --> 2:14:22.760]  the former top FBI agent who ran
[2:14:22.760 --> 2:14:24.760]  all of the Southern District of California told me all that
[2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:26.760]  and by the way they just declassified a month ago
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:28.760]  thousands of pages, everything Ted Gunnerson told me
[2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:30.760]  I read most of the
[2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:32.760]  about a month ago at night
[2:14:32.760 --> 2:14:34.760]  I took it home
[2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:38.760]  and I started crying
[2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:42.760]  because I was having all these flashbacks
[2:14:42.760 --> 2:14:44.760]  all the times I had dinner with Ted Gunnerson
[2:14:44.760 --> 2:14:46.760]  and I probably met with a guy 20 times over the years
[2:14:46.760 --> 2:14:48.760]  and how earnest he was
[2:14:48.760 --> 2:14:50.760]  and how he was telling me and like writing notes saying
[2:14:50.760 --> 2:14:52.760]  Alex you gotta check this, you ought to interview this person

[2:20:46.760 --> 2:20:48.760]  this broadcast is in the arena
[2:20:48.760 --> 2:20:50.760]  Teddy Roosevelt said it back
[2:20:50.760 --> 2:20:52.760]  and you can't quote it enough
[2:20:52.760 --> 2:20:54.760]  it is not the critic who counts
[2:20:54.760 --> 2:20:56.760]  not the man who points out how the strong
[2:20:56.760 --> 2:20:58.760]  man stumbles or where the doer
[2:20:58.760 --> 2:21:00.760]  of deeds could have done them better
[2:21:00.760 --> 2:21:02.760]  the credit belongs to the man
[2:21:02.760 --> 2:21:04.760]  who is actually in the arena
[2:21:04.760 --> 2:21:06.760]  whose face is marred by dust and sweat
[2:21:06.760 --> 2:21:08.760]  and blood who strives valiantly
[2:21:08.760 --> 2:21:10.760]  who hers who comes short again

[2:21:12.760 --> 2:21:14.760]  without error and shortcomings
[2:21:14.760 --> 2:21:16.760]  but who does actually strive
[2:21:16.760 --> 2:21:18.760]  to do the deeds
[2:21:18.760 --> 2:21:20.760]  who knows the great enthusiasm
[2:21:20.760 --> 2:21:22.760]  the great devotions
[2:21:22.760 --> 2:21:24.760]  who spends himself on a worthy cause
[2:21:24.760 --> 2:21:26.760]  and who at best knows in the end
[2:21:26.760 --> 2:21:28.760]  the triumph of high achievement
[2:21:28.760 --> 2:21:30.760]  and who at worst if he fails
[2:21:30.760 --> 2:21:32.760]  in the end
[2:21:32.760 --> 2:21:34.760]  at least fails while daring greatly
[2:21:34.760 --> 2:21:36.760]  so that his place shall never be
[2:21:36.760 --> 2:21:38.760]  with those cold and timid souls
[2:21:38.760 --> 2:21:40.760]  who neither know victory nor defeat
[2:21:40.760 --> 2:21:42.760]  so I salute you all

[2:22:48.760 --> 2:22:50.760]  they say a picture
[2:22:50.760 --> 2:22:52.760]  tells a thousand words
[2:22:52.760 --> 2:22:54.760]  and this one I think tells a little bit more than that
[2:22:54.760 --> 2:22:56.760]  China
[2:22:56.760 --> 2:22:58.760]  man interrogated for criticizing police

[2:23:08.760 --> 2:23:10.760]  if you're a radio listener go to info wars.com
[2:23:10.760 --> 2:23:12.760]  he is what looks like
[2:23:12.760 --> 2:23:14.760]  a school chair
[2:23:14.760 --> 2:23:16.760]  a school desk
[2:23:16.760 --> 2:23:18.760]  but it's metal and his hands
[2:23:18.760 --> 2:23:20.760]  are
[2:23:20.760 --> 2:23:22.760]  chained down
[2:23:22.760 --> 2:23:24.760]  bracketed down
[2:23:24.760 --> 2:23:26.760]  and his upper arms are
[2:23:26.760 --> 2:23:28.760]  and he's crammed into
[2:23:28.760 --> 2:23:30.760]  what is a restraint chair
[2:23:32.760 --> 2:23:34.760]  we're going to air some of this audio in a moment
[2:23:34.760 --> 2:23:36.760]  and the Chinese communist police
[2:23:36.760 --> 2:23:38.760]  are saying so you talk
[2:23:38.760 --> 2:23:40.760]  bad about the police
[2:23:40.760 --> 2:23:42.760]  on one of these
[2:23:42.760 --> 2:23:44.760]  social apps
[2:23:44.760 --> 2:23:46.760]  and they track back his identity
[2:23:46.760 --> 2:23:48.760]  and he said yes I did
[2:23:48.760 --> 2:23:50.760]  what he really means
[2:23:50.760 --> 2:23:52.760]  he's talking about the state and he says I'm drunk I'm sorry
[2:23:52.760 --> 2:23:54.760]  and he then begs them
[2:23:54.760 --> 2:23:56.760]  of course we don't know what happened
[2:23:56.760 --> 2:23:58.760]  people are sent to reeducation camps
[2:23:58.760 --> 2:24:00.760]  or killed for less
[2:24:00.760 --> 2:24:02.760]  but the issue is
[2:24:02.760 --> 2:24:04.760]  this is what they do with their social score
[2:24:04.760 --> 2:24:06.760]  where you have to face scan
[2:24:06.760 --> 2:24:08.760]  to get online
[2:24:08.760 --> 2:24:10.760]  and all the new phones of course globally
[2:24:10.760 --> 2:24:12.760]  have had this on them for two years now
[2:24:12.760 --> 2:24:14.760]  it's all standardized
[2:24:14.760 --> 2:24:16.760]  and China is the testing ground
[2:24:16.760 --> 2:24:18.760]  before we air that audio look at this article
[2:24:18.760 --> 2:24:20.760]  out of french news agency
[2:24:20.760 --> 2:24:22.760]  China introduces mandatory face scans
[2:24:22.760 --> 2:24:24.760]  for phone users
[2:24:24.760 --> 2:24:26.760]  and so to own a phone
[2:24:26.760 --> 2:24:28.760]  it has to be hooked in to the state run
[2:24:28.760 --> 2:24:30.760]  telecom wall way
[2:24:30.760 --> 2:24:32.760]  and then of course
[2:24:32.760 --> 2:24:34.760]  you have to face scan to even get on the internet
[2:24:34.760 --> 2:24:36.760]  that way you're not using somebody else's
[2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:38.760]  and if you even call somebody
[2:24:38.760 --> 2:24:40.760]  who's been downgraded
[2:24:40.760 --> 2:24:42.760]  well you lose your score
[2:24:42.760 --> 2:24:44.760]  as well and it goes down enough
[2:24:44.760 --> 2:24:46.760]  you're not allowed to go outside your door
[2:24:46.760 --> 2:24:48.760]  one half foot that's a chinese government statement
[2:24:48.760 --> 2:24:50.760]  we will be able to control you
[2:24:50.760 --> 2:24:52.760]  where you can't even leave your home one half foot
[2:24:52.760 --> 2:24:54.760]  then you will lose your house and will starve to death on the street
[2:24:54.760 --> 2:24:56.760]  that's the wonders of the cashless society
[2:24:56.760 --> 2:24:58.760]  and the system
[2:24:58.760 --> 2:25:00.760]  that they're putting into place
[2:25:00.760 --> 2:25:02.760]  and this system
[2:25:02.760 --> 2:25:04.760]  was designed with western companies
[2:25:04.760 --> 2:25:06.760]  brought to china
[2:25:06.760 --> 2:25:08.760]  the globalists put the chinese communist in power
[2:25:08.760 --> 2:25:10.760]  and trump won't even stand up
[2:25:10.760 --> 2:25:12.760]  against the censorship that's taking place
[2:25:12.760 --> 2:25:14.760]  he's standing up to wall way which is good
[2:25:14.760 --> 2:25:16.760]  but apple is even more in bed with the chi coms
[2:25:16.760 --> 2:25:18.760]  than wall way in many respects
[2:25:18.760 --> 2:25:20.760]  and they've got all of your passcodes
[2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:22.760]  your apple key code is stored in china
[2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:24.760]  he first reported that
[2:25:24.760 --> 2:25:26.760]  almost two years ago
[2:25:26.760 --> 2:25:28.760]  I'm not going to tell who I told this
[2:25:28.760 --> 2:25:30.760]  but I was talking to a talk show host
[2:25:30.760 --> 2:25:32.760]  when I was in DC
[2:25:32.760 --> 2:25:34.760]  and I was telling him this
[2:25:34.760 --> 2:25:36.760]  and he didn't believe me so I pulled it up and showed him Reuters
[2:25:36.760 --> 2:25:38.760]  he said the president has to know this
[2:25:38.760 --> 2:25:40.760]  I'm going to be meeting with him tonight
[2:25:40.760 --> 2:25:42.760]  don't tell anybody I said
[2:25:42.760 --> 2:25:44.760]  I won't tell anybody I'm meeting with
[2:25:44.760 --> 2:25:46.760]  obviously your name
[2:25:46.760 --> 2:25:48.760]  and little word is
[2:25:48.760 --> 2:25:50.760]  that that helped contribute to the wall way decision
[2:25:50.760 --> 2:25:52.760]  and again I'm not bragging about info wars
[2:25:52.760 --> 2:25:54.760]  the president so isolated
[2:25:54.760 --> 2:25:56.760]  and so surrounded he didn't know
[2:25:56.760 --> 2:25:58.760]  that apple had moved to china
[2:25:58.760 --> 2:26:00.760]  early last year
[2:26:00.760 --> 2:26:02.760]  was in Reuters and had given him the code keys
[2:26:02.760 --> 2:26:04.760]  that's how weak the globalist are
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:08.760]  that I'm in DC
[2:26:10.760 --> 2:26:12.760]  I'm sitting there having drinks
[2:26:12.760 --> 2:26:14.760]  with a well-known talk show host
[2:26:14.760 --> 2:26:16.760]  back when I still had a few drinks
[2:26:16.760 --> 2:26:18.760]  and I tell him this
[2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:20.760]  and he goes Alex come on I pull it up
[2:26:20.760 --> 2:26:22.760]  I text message and he goes give me a call
[2:26:22.760 --> 2:26:24.760]  and you know boom
[2:26:24.760 --> 2:26:28.760]  he's covering it a couple days later
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:32.760]  he's like but the pentagon is a pentagon
[2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:34.760]  he's like excuse me
[2:26:34.760 --> 2:26:36.760]  he took like five minutes read the article
[2:26:36.760 --> 2:26:38.760]  he looked up what the code keys are
[2:26:38.760 --> 2:26:40.760]  and then they said yes when you're in China
[2:26:40.760 --> 2:26:42.760]  you let the Chinese government run things
[2:26:42.760 --> 2:26:44.760]  Chinese intelligence runs apple
[2:26:44.760 --> 2:26:46.760]  and I'm sitting here
[2:26:46.760 --> 2:26:48.760]  telling everybody this
[2:26:48.760 --> 2:26:50.760]  I mean yeah there's the article
[2:26:50.760 --> 2:26:52.760]  it's hidden in plain view
[2:26:52.760 --> 2:26:54.760]  it's hidden in plain view
[2:26:54.760 --> 2:26:56.760]  it's hidden in plain view
[2:26:56.760 --> 2:26:58.760]  and so the left comes up to me on the street
[2:26:58.760 --> 2:27:00.760]  and they say I can't wait till you're arrested
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:02.760]  I can't wait till you're in jail
[2:27:02.760 --> 2:27:04.760]  for what you've done they moved on from Russia
[2:27:04.760 --> 2:27:06.760]  just to the fact that I hope you go to prison
[2:27:06.760 --> 2:27:08.760]  hell you see videos of it where I'm on the street
[2:27:08.760 --> 2:27:10.760]  thinking about spit on me and say go to prison
[2:27:10.760 --> 2:27:12.760]  effort I got in a wheelchair came over
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:14.760]  and reached between my security
[2:27:14.760 --> 2:27:16.760]  at the Trump event at apple a few weeks ago
[2:27:16.760 --> 2:27:18.760]  pinched the snot out of me
[2:27:18.760 --> 2:27:20.760]  I mean I had a little you know
[2:27:20.760 --> 2:27:22.760]  mark on me
[2:27:24.760 --> 2:27:26.760]  and
[2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:28.760]  I turned around and almost
[2:27:28.760 --> 2:27:30.760]  punched whoever it was and I looked
[2:27:30.760 --> 2:27:32.760]  and it was a leftist smiling up in a wheelchair
[2:27:32.760 --> 2:27:34.760]  again
[2:27:34.760 --> 2:27:36.760]  from the top they're evil down to the bottom
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:38.760]  they're all about setting you up
[2:27:38.760 --> 2:27:40.760]  they're all about smoliting you
[2:27:40.760 --> 2:27:42.760]  they're all about tricking you
[2:27:42.760 --> 2:27:44.760]  they're decepticons
[2:27:44.760 --> 2:27:46.760]  they live in deception
[2:27:46.760 --> 2:27:48.760]  they breathe deception
[2:27:48.760 --> 2:27:50.760]  they're not them they're evil
[2:27:52.760 --> 2:27:54.760]  and I don't like to talk about how people look
[2:27:54.760 --> 2:27:56.760]  you can see an old man who's been in a car wreck
[2:27:56.760 --> 2:27:58.760]  and he's 89 years old but you see fire in his eyes
[2:27:58.760 --> 2:28:00.760]  and there's dignity to him
[2:28:00.760 --> 2:28:02.760]  you go to a leftist rally
[2:28:02.760 --> 2:28:04.760]  they look like their souls have been sucked
[2:28:04.760 --> 2:28:06.760]  they're not just fat
[2:28:06.760 --> 2:28:08.760]  you can see a jolly fat person that has a happy soul
[2:28:08.760 --> 2:28:10.760]  and they're cool
[2:28:10.760 --> 2:28:12.760]  but they all have this weird pedofat
[2:28:12.760 --> 2:28:14.760]  with huge fat body little bitty arms
[2:28:14.760 --> 2:28:16.760]  and they're just walking around like
[2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:18.760]  they're going to kill you
[2:28:18.760 --> 2:28:20.760]  I love communism
[2:28:20.760 --> 2:28:22.760]  I like children
[2:28:22.760 --> 2:28:24.760]  and you're like what happened to these people
[2:28:24.760 --> 2:28:26.760]  they look like their souls
[2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:28.760]  have been sucked out by Maleficent
[2:28:28.760 --> 2:28:30.760]  in the Little Mermaid
[2:28:30.760 --> 2:28:32.760]  and that's it and they want to steal our voice
[2:28:32.760 --> 2:28:34.760]  so they can use it to trick more souls
[2:28:34.760 --> 2:28:36.760]  to come to them
[2:28:36.760 --> 2:28:38.760]  it's all in the children's fables
[2:28:38.760 --> 2:28:40.760]  you will not have my voice
[2:28:40.760 --> 2:28:42.760]  you will not silence info wars
[2:28:42.760 --> 2:28:44.760]  the listeners stand with us

[2:28:54.760 --> 2:28:56.760]  or doing too many drugs
[2:28:56.760 --> 2:28:58.760]  listen to me
[2:28:58.760 --> 2:29:00.760]  you don't know me and we'll never meet
[2:29:00.760 --> 2:29:02.760]  I had a problem like you once
[2:29:02.760 --> 2:29:04.760]  I drank and used to party a little too much
[2:29:04.760 --> 2:29:06.760]  till it got out of control
[2:29:06.760 --> 2:29:08.760]  and almost ruined my life
[2:29:08.760 --> 2:29:10.760]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem
[2:29:10.760 --> 2:29:12.760]  before it totally destroyed me

[2:31:58.760 --> 2:32:00.760]  in the korean war
[2:32:00.760 --> 2:32:02.760]  3 million chai comms
[2:32:02.760 --> 2:32:04.760]  had flooded across the border and surrounded
[2:32:04.760 --> 2:32:06.760]  the marines

[2:32:08.760 --> 2:32:10.760]  some estimates have it
[2:32:10.760 --> 2:32:12.760]  but the point is they were outnumbered
[2:32:12.760 --> 2:32:14.760]  and the general
[2:32:14.760 --> 2:32:16.760]  was told general were completely surrounded
[2:32:16.760 --> 2:32:18.760]  he said good we can attack in all
[2:32:18.760 --> 2:32:20.760]  directions
[2:32:20.760 --> 2:32:22.760]  well that's the point that info wars
[2:32:22.760 --> 2:32:24.760]  has reached
[2:32:24.760 --> 2:32:26.760]  and it really is epic it really is biblical
[2:32:26.760 --> 2:32:28.760]  and we wouldn't have gone this far
[2:32:28.760 --> 2:32:30.760]  but it's going to become more critical
[2:32:30.760 --> 2:32:32.760]  than ever
[2:32:32.760 --> 2:32:34.760]  as the censorship
[2:32:34.760 --> 2:32:36.760]  becomes complete
[2:32:36.760 --> 2:32:38.760]  and it's not just americans but folks all over the world
[2:32:38.760 --> 2:32:40.760]  are completely silenced
[2:32:40.760 --> 2:32:42.760]  when it comes to speaking the name of a CIA
[2:32:42.760 --> 2:32:44.760]  fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile
[2:32:44.760 --> 2:32:46.760]  or
[2:32:46.760 --> 2:32:48.760]  speaking out against dangerous vaccines
[2:32:48.760 --> 2:32:50.760]  because by info wars having its own platform
[2:32:50.760 --> 2:33:00.760]  that check makes the globalist
[2:33:20.760 --> 2:33:22.760]  all right
[2:33:22.760 --> 2:33:24.760]  again i'm not complaining
[2:33:24.760 --> 2:33:26.760]  but imagine
[2:33:26.760 --> 2:33:28.760]  if you had to keep broadcasting
[2:33:28.760 --> 2:33:30.760]  on the radio and tv
[2:33:30.760 --> 2:33:32.760]  while the building is burning down next door
[2:33:32.760 --> 2:33:34.760]  that's basically what's going on around here
[2:33:34.760 --> 2:33:36.760]  let me put it to you this way
[2:33:36.760 --> 2:33:38.760]  it's a big deal
[2:33:38.760 --> 2:33:40.760]  it's a big deal
[2:33:40.760 --> 2:33:42.760]  it's a big deal
[2:33:42.760 --> 2:33:44.760]  it's a big deal
[2:33:44.760 --> 2:33:46.760]  it's a big deal
[2:33:46.760 --> 2:33:48.760]  it's a big deal
[2:33:48.760 --> 2:33:50.760]  let me put it to you this way
[2:33:50.760 --> 2:33:52.760]  we've got a story
[2:33:54.760 --> 2:33:56.760]  that is so huge
[2:33:56.760 --> 2:33:58.760]  that i already confirmed a month ago
[2:33:58.760 --> 2:34:00.760]  that's been
[2:34:00.760 --> 2:34:02.760]  hiding in plain view
[2:34:02.760 --> 2:34:04.760]  that broke yesterday
[2:34:04.760 --> 2:34:06.760]  and has over a million
[2:34:06.760 --> 2:34:08.760]  200,000 views with no
[2:34:08.760 --> 2:34:10.760]  news articles about it
[2:34:10.760 --> 2:34:12.760]  but if i say too much
[2:34:12.760 --> 2:34:14.760]  about what i know
[2:34:14.760 --> 2:34:16.760]  it can mess up
[2:34:16.760 --> 2:34:18.760]  things we've got going on
[2:34:18.760 --> 2:34:20.760]  so i have to leave it at that
[2:34:20.760 --> 2:34:22.760]  they have facilities
[2:34:22.760 --> 2:34:24.760]  in austin
[2:34:24.760 --> 2:34:26.760]  and i have this from the police department
[2:34:30.760 --> 2:34:32.760]  that are model test
[2:34:32.760 --> 2:34:34.760]  for the collapse of society
[2:34:34.760 --> 2:34:36.760]  and martial law civil war
[2:34:36.760 --> 2:34:38.760]  and they've already got
[2:34:38.760 --> 2:34:40.760]  thousands of people microchipped
[2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:44.760]  and they're beta testing it
[2:34:44.760 --> 2:34:46.760]  with a company
[2:34:46.760 --> 2:34:48.760]  run by the united nations
[2:34:48.760 --> 2:34:50.760]  now i've got copies of the contracts
[2:34:52.760 --> 2:34:54.760]  and i had this a month ago
[2:34:54.760 --> 2:34:56.760]  and intended to do
[2:34:56.760 --> 2:34:58.760]  more on it
[2:34:58.760 --> 2:35:00.760]  and did do something on it
[2:35:00.760 --> 2:35:02.760]  but then it began to break
[2:35:02.760 --> 2:35:04.760]  just organically because you can't hide something like this
[2:35:04.760 --> 2:35:06.760]  and by the way
[2:35:06.760 --> 2:35:08.760]  i'm not sitting on it
[2:35:08.760 --> 2:35:10.760]  i'm saying they can't hide it
[2:35:10.760 --> 2:35:12.760]  oh my god
[2:35:12.760 --> 2:35:14.760]  the angles
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:16.760]  of this thing alone
[2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:18.760]  make my head explode
[2:35:22.760 --> 2:35:24.760]  and again, your head explodes
[2:35:24.760 --> 2:35:26.760]  at this level
[2:35:26.760 --> 2:35:28.760]  not to be on the radio talking to people
[2:35:28.760 --> 2:35:30.760]  we're supposed to be taking action at this point
[2:35:30.760 --> 2:35:32.760]  this is what hit me this weekend
[2:35:32.760 --> 2:35:34.760]  we need to have a big demonstration
[2:35:34.760 --> 2:35:36.760]  outside the water treatment plant
[2:35:36.760 --> 2:35:38.760]  here in austin where they put
[2:35:38.760 --> 2:35:40.760]  hydrofluorosilic acid in the water
[2:35:40.760 --> 2:35:42.760]  and they admit in major harvard studies
[2:35:42.760 --> 2:35:44.760]  it causes brain damage and increases cancer
[2:35:44.760 --> 2:35:46.760]  that's something we should be doing
[2:35:46.760 --> 2:35:48.760]  people should be filing lawsuits to stop it
[2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:50.760]  instead of having the mayor laugh at people
[2:35:50.760 --> 2:35:52.760]  up there from his dais when we bring the top
[2:35:52.760 --> 2:35:54.760]  toxicologist here
[2:35:56.760 --> 2:35:58.760]  from
[2:35:58.760 --> 2:36:00.760]  cornell
[2:36:04.760 --> 2:36:06.760]  and they just laughed in his face
[2:36:06.760 --> 2:36:08.760]  guys i'm going from memory that was 10 years ago
[2:36:08.760 --> 2:36:10.760]  look up dr connet
[2:36:10.760 --> 2:36:12.760]  is it cornell or was it
[2:36:12.760 --> 2:36:14.760]  i just looked up about the cornell
[2:36:14.760 --> 2:36:16.760]  i mean dr uh
[2:36:16.760 --> 2:36:18.760]  connet
[2:36:18.760 --> 2:36:20.760]  and the new mayors laughed at us
[2:36:20.760 --> 2:36:22.760]  owens gone down there
[2:36:22.760 --> 2:36:24.760]  the new mayor laughed at us
[2:36:24.760 --> 2:36:26.760]  we bring them reports from harvard and cornell
[2:36:26.760 --> 2:36:28.760]  and the entire
[2:36:28.760 --> 2:36:30.760]  lobby of government scientists
[2:36:30.760 --> 2:36:32.760]  that work at the epa
[2:36:32.760 --> 2:36:34.760]  have signed letters
[2:36:34.760 --> 2:36:36.760]  in 2001 and then again in 2010
[2:36:36.760 --> 2:36:38.760]  saying take it out of the water
[2:36:38.760 --> 2:36:40.760]  it's causing brain damage and infertility
[2:36:40.760 --> 2:36:42.760]  and we bring up that letter and the damn mayor
[2:36:42.760 --> 2:36:44.760]  laughed at us you know what
[2:36:44.760 --> 2:36:46.760]  they're assaulting us with a damn chemical weapon
[2:36:48.760 --> 2:36:50.760]  and now
[2:36:54.760 --> 2:36:56.760]  they've got
[2:36:56.760 --> 2:36:58.760]  an old hotel they just bought
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:00.760]  for millions of dollars from the mayor's buddy
[2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:04.760]  that they renovated for the homeless people
[2:37:08.760 --> 2:37:10.760]  and there's sponsorship going on
[2:37:10.760 --> 2:37:12.760]  with
[2:37:12.760 --> 2:37:14.760]  google
[2:37:14.760 --> 2:37:16.760]  and do you want to know why
[2:37:16.760 --> 2:37:18.760]  because it's a smart city test
[2:37:18.760 --> 2:37:20.760]  of open air prisons
[2:37:20.760 --> 2:37:22.760]  with microchipped homeless people
[2:37:24.760 --> 2:37:26.760]  and we have the documents
[2:37:26.760 --> 2:37:28.760]  it's confirmed
[2:37:28.760 --> 2:37:30.760]  and we've already talked to homeless people
[2:37:32.760 --> 2:37:34.760]  and we're
[2:37:34.760 --> 2:37:36.760]  getting their medical records from them
[2:37:38.760 --> 2:37:40.760]  and we're meeting with the people that are their city
[2:37:40.760 --> 2:37:42.760]  sponsors
[2:37:44.760 --> 2:37:46.760]  and again
[2:37:46.760 --> 2:37:48.760]  they roll out the chips with the most disadvantaged
[2:37:48.760 --> 2:37:50.760]  make it all sound great
[2:37:50.760 --> 2:37:52.760]  oh we set up this smart warehouse
[2:37:52.760 --> 2:37:54.760]  in this smart city
[2:37:54.760 --> 2:37:56.760]  and now we track the homeless
[2:37:56.760 --> 2:37:58.760]  with these readable microchips
[2:37:58.760 --> 2:38:00.760]  that 5G google tracks
[2:38:00.760 --> 2:38:02.760]  yeah
[2:38:02.760 --> 2:38:04.760]  yeah
[2:38:04.760 --> 2:38:06.760]  yeah
[2:38:06.760 --> 2:38:08.760]  I'll cover that next hour I'll play the video
[2:38:08.760 --> 2:38:10.760]  here comes Rob do
[2:38:12.760 --> 2:38:14.760]  come on over here
[2:38:14.760 --> 2:38:16.760]  I know you're working on this
[2:38:16.760 --> 2:38:18.760]  Paul Connick was he at what university
[2:38:18.760 --> 2:38:20.760]  St. Lawrence
[2:38:20.760 --> 2:38:22.760]  but then he worked somewhere else
[2:38:22.760 --> 2:38:24.760]  when he got the whole group of scientists to sign the deal
[2:38:24.760 --> 2:38:26.760]  wasn't Cornell
[2:38:26.760 --> 2:38:28.760]  I grabbed that real quick
[2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:30.760]  my memories
[2:38:30.760 --> 2:38:32.760]  he did have some stuff in Europe
[2:38:32.760 --> 2:38:34.760]  yeah Paul Connick
[2:38:34.760 --> 2:38:36.760]  anyways we're going to get Dr. Connick back on
[2:38:36.760 --> 2:38:38.760]  anyways
[2:38:38.760 --> 2:38:40.760]  anyways
[2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:42.760]  the mayor laughing at him that's always nice
[2:38:42.760 --> 2:38:44.760]  how's it going
[2:38:44.760 --> 2:38:46.760]  with the interview with the homeless people
[2:38:46.760 --> 2:38:48.760]  I've got a call at 4
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:38:50.760]  we'll take care of it then
[2:38:50.760 --> 2:38:52.760]  thanks
[2:38:52.760 --> 2:38:54.760]  okay and then let me just give you
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:38:56.760]  another example of what's going on here
[2:38:56.760 --> 2:38:58.760]  you see this story been out
[2:38:58.760 --> 2:39:00.760]  since the weekend
[2:39:00.760 --> 2:39:02.760]  stop on zero hedge dot com
[2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:04.760]  and it's linked to the British newspapers
[2:39:04.760 --> 2:39:06.760]  turns out
[2:39:08.760 --> 2:39:10.760]  turns out
[2:39:12.760 --> 2:39:14.760]  we know
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:18.760]  that it's not a hacker
[2:39:18.760 --> 2:39:20.760]  just like you were told with Seth Rich
[2:39:20.760 --> 2:39:22.760]  that you know it was a hack
[2:39:22.760 --> 2:39:24.760]  and the evidence of course points towards it was downloaded at the point of origin
[2:39:26.760 --> 2:39:28.760]  that it's not a hack and it turns out
[2:39:30.760 --> 2:39:32.760]  in force
[2:39:36.760 --> 2:39:38.760]  has the scoop on this
[2:39:38.760 --> 2:39:40.760]  and I just had to say that on air
[2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:46.760]  can you imagine how dangerous all this is
[2:39:46.760 --> 2:39:48.760]  can you imagine how scared the system is right now
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:50.760]  Epstein tapes
[2:39:50.760 --> 2:39:52.760]  sorted case
[2:39:52.760 --> 2:39:54.760]  takes a bizarre turn after mystery
[2:39:54.760 --> 2:39:56.760]  hacker emerges
[2:39:56.760 --> 2:39:58.760]  MI6
[2:39:58.760 --> 2:40:00.760]  connected groups are reporting there's a bunch of videos
[2:40:00.760 --> 2:40:02.760]  about to come out
[2:40:02.760 --> 2:40:04.760]  so that he gets taken off Prince Andrew
[2:40:04.760 --> 2:40:06.760]  that videos are going to be released of
[2:40:06.760 --> 2:40:08.760]  billionaires and world leaders
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:10.760]  having sex with underage girls
[2:40:10.760 --> 2:40:12.760]  just to begin with
[2:40:14.760 --> 2:40:16.760]  and again you don't think
[2:40:16.760 --> 2:40:18.760]  it'd be hackers that would actually have that
[2:40:18.760 --> 2:40:20.760]  do you
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:22.760]  really has it is law enforcement
[2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:24.760]  at the state and local level
[2:40:24.760 --> 2:40:26.760]  in Florida
[2:40:26.760 --> 2:40:28.760]  and then at the FBI level
[2:40:28.760 --> 2:40:30.760]  and then at the Eric Prince
[2:40:30.760 --> 2:40:32.760]  XZ
[2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:34.760]  frontier
[2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:36.760]  type situation
[2:40:40.760 --> 2:40:42.760]  so yes
[2:40:42.760 --> 2:40:44.760]  obviously the whole operation was about video taping
[2:40:44.760 --> 2:40:46.760]  and blackmailing people
[2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:48.760]  people knew they were going to be blackmailed to get in the club
[2:40:48.760 --> 2:40:50.760]  all the initiation is you videotape
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:52.760]  me having sex with kids
[2:40:52.760 --> 2:40:54.760]  yep that's how it works
[2:40:56.760 --> 2:40:58.760]  that's the club big club we ain't in it
[2:40:58.760 --> 2:41:00.760]  don't want in it
[2:41:00.760 --> 2:41:02.760]  want to take down those that are in it
[2:41:04.760 --> 2:41:06.760]  but that's what's going on
[2:41:10.760 --> 2:41:12.760]  and so I'm a little breathless
[2:41:12.760 --> 2:41:14.760]  I'm a little speechless
[2:41:14.760 --> 2:41:16.760]  at points here
[2:41:16.760 --> 2:41:18.760]  because I don't even feel like I should be on air at this point
[2:41:18.760 --> 2:41:20.760]  I should just be
[2:41:22.760 --> 2:41:24.760]  spending weeks figuring out
[2:41:24.760 --> 2:41:26.760]  the next move against these people
[2:41:26.760 --> 2:41:28.760]  but I'm caught here
[2:41:28.760 --> 2:41:30.760]  always on air and so all I can do
[2:41:30.760 --> 2:41:32.760]  is brainstorm here on air with all of you
[2:41:32.760 --> 2:41:34.760]  I mean it's overwhelming
[2:41:34.760 --> 2:41:36.760]  you talk about information singularity this is it
[2:41:36.760 --> 2:41:38.760]  I mean
[2:41:38.760 --> 2:41:40.760]  we got the paperwork
[2:41:40.760 --> 2:41:42.760]  microchipping homeless people
[2:41:42.760 --> 2:41:44.760]  in a smart city
[2:41:44.760 --> 2:41:46.760]  outside town
[2:41:46.760 --> 2:41:48.760]  in East Boston
[2:41:48.760 --> 2:41:50.760]  outside downtown
[2:41:54.760 --> 2:41:56.760]  they bought a big hotel
[2:41:56.760 --> 2:41:58.760]  and they're going to do it there
[2:41:58.760 --> 2:42:00.760]  starting in a couple weeks
[2:42:02.760 --> 2:42:04.760]  the microchipping has begun
[2:42:04.760 --> 2:42:06.760]  and see once they fully collapse society
[2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:08.760]  you want your food you want you turn your guns in
[2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:10.760]  take the chip
[2:42:10.760 --> 2:42:12.760]  that's how we always knew they were going to do it
[2:42:12.760 --> 2:42:14.760]  and it's all happening like clockwork
[2:42:14.760 --> 2:42:16.760]  and this isn't some Netflix dystopic movie
[2:42:16.760 --> 2:42:18.760]  who could come up with this
[2:42:18.760 --> 2:42:20.760]  devil worshipers
[2:42:20.760 --> 2:42:22.760]  world government
[2:42:22.760 --> 2:42:24.760]  people with a driven hunger
[2:42:24.760 --> 2:42:26.760]  for blood
[2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:28.760]  and raping children in control
[2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:30.760]  and then the whole collapse
[2:42:30.760 --> 2:42:32.760]  of it as they all in fight
[2:42:32.760 --> 2:42:34.760]  with each other over the technology
[2:42:34.760 --> 2:42:36.760]  and surveillance grids
[2:42:36.760 --> 2:42:38.760]  in the middle
[2:42:38.760 --> 2:42:40.760]  and the average man is just going to be playing golf
[2:42:40.760 --> 2:42:42.760]  you know there's that famous video and photo
[2:42:42.760 --> 2:42:44.760]  of out in California
[2:42:44.760 --> 2:42:46.760]  and the mountains are burning just a few hundred yards away
[2:42:46.760 --> 2:42:48.760]  and the people are still playing golf
[2:42:48.760 --> 2:42:50.760]  I mean that's literally what this is like
[2:42:50.760 --> 2:42:52.760]  fiddling while Rome burns
[2:42:52.760 --> 2:42:54.760]  importstore.com
[2:42:54.760 --> 2:42:56.760]  we have a new product
[2:42:56.760 --> 2:42:58.760]  and we got several thousand of these
[2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:00.760]  in and they're going to sell out in a few days
[2:43:00.760 --> 2:43:02.760]  at the rate we're selling them
[2:43:02.760 --> 2:43:04.760]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:06.760]  a game changing toothpaste
[2:43:06.760 --> 2:43:08.760]  and it doesn't compete
[2:43:08.760 --> 2:43:10.760]  with super blue that's four to five a colloidal
[2:43:10.760 --> 2:43:12.760]  silver and iodine and fluoride free
[2:43:12.760 --> 2:43:14.760]  the adult or the children's
[2:43:14.760 --> 2:43:16.760]  these are both excellent toothpaste
[2:43:16.760 --> 2:43:18.760]  concentrates that don't have fillers
[2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:20.760]  people love it this is a whitening toothpaste
[2:43:20.760 --> 2:43:22.760]  that also has the above sea
[2:43:22.760 --> 2:43:24.760]  coral calcium that also
[2:43:24.760 --> 2:43:26.760]  cleans but also re
[2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:28.760]  mineralizes the teeth
[2:43:28.760 --> 2:43:30.760]  then it has the patented silver
[2:43:30.760 --> 2:43:32.760]  silver in it to knock out the bacteria
[2:43:32.760 --> 2:43:34.760]  that cause gensivitis this is all proven
[2:43:34.760 --> 2:43:36.760]  you can make claims with this
[2:43:36.760 --> 2:43:38.760]  but I have to tell you no one has a toothpaste
[2:43:38.760 --> 2:43:40.760]  that's good for knocking out the bacteria
[2:43:40.760 --> 2:43:42.760]  the viruses
[2:43:42.760 --> 2:43:44.760]  and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way
[2:43:44.760 --> 2:43:46.760]  that doesn't strip away the enamel
[2:43:46.760 --> 2:43:48.760]  so we're really proud of it
[2:43:48.760 --> 2:43:50.760]  it funds the operation inforstore.com
[2:43:50.760 --> 2:43:52.760]  and that's why we're still on air thanks to you
[2:43:54.760 --> 2:43:56.760]  Beto O'Rourke came out
[2:43:56.760 --> 2:43:58.760]  dozens of times and said
[2:43:58.760 --> 2:44:00.760]  we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles
[2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:02.760]  and he got all the other democrats
[2:44:02.760 --> 2:44:04.760]  on the stage nine others to agree
[2:44:04.760 --> 2:44:06.760]  and said that he was a hero
[2:44:06.760 --> 2:44:08.760]  think about that
[2:44:08.760 --> 2:44:10.760]  now those democrats have taken all the guns
[2:44:10.760 --> 2:44:12.760]  in the cities they control
[2:44:12.760 --> 2:44:14.760]  their blue cities are literal crap holes
[2:44:14.760 --> 2:44:16.760]  covered with needles
[2:44:16.760 --> 2:44:18.760]  and with massive drug dealing
[2:44:18.760 --> 2:44:20.760]  and incredible levels of violent crime
[2:44:20.760 --> 2:44:22.760]  they know what they're doing
[2:44:22.760 --> 2:44:24.760]  and now the supreme courts
[2:44:24.760 --> 2:44:26.760]  come out and ruled that gun manufacturers
[2:44:26.760 --> 2:44:28.760]  can be sued into oblivion
[2:44:28.760 --> 2:44:30.760]  for what criminals do
[2:44:30.760 --> 2:44:32.760]  using their firearms
[2:44:32.760 --> 2:44:34.760]  this country is under such incredible attack
[2:44:34.760 --> 2:44:36.760]  but more and more
[2:44:36.760 --> 2:44:38.760]  towns and cities are saying
[2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:40.760]  they're sanctuaries for the second amendment
[2:44:40.760 --> 2:44:42.760]  and they're going to follow the original bill of rights
[2:44:42.760 --> 2:44:44.760]  and constitution
[2:44:44.760 --> 2:44:46.760]  and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns
[2:44:46.760 --> 2:44:48.760]  so you see a lot of these cities
[2:44:48.760 --> 2:44:50.760]  ignore illegal aliens
[2:44:50.760 --> 2:44:52.760]  well we can ignore all your unconstitutional laws
[2:44:54.760 --> 2:44:56.760]  the anti-defamation
[2:44:56.760 --> 2:44:58.760]  league is one of the most powerful
[2:44:58.760 --> 2:45:00.760]  globalist, leftist
[2:45:00.760 --> 2:45:02.760]  anti-american organizations on the face of the planet
[2:45:02.760 --> 2:45:04.760]  and they have declared
[2:45:04.760 --> 2:45:06.760]  that info wars is public
[2:45:06.760 --> 2:45:08.760]  enemy number one
[2:45:08.760 --> 2:45:10.760]  they gave tim cook of apple
[2:45:10.760 --> 2:45:12.760]  an award specifically
[2:45:12.760 --> 2:45:14.760]  for deplatforming me to make
[2:45:14.760 --> 2:45:16.760]  sure that tens of millions of people
[2:45:16.760 --> 2:45:18.760]  could not hear the show
[2:45:18.760 --> 2:45:20.760]  and now they've had sasha barrick cohen
[2:45:20.760 --> 2:45:22.760]  come out and call for the
[2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:24.760]  arrest of big
[2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:26.760]  blackheads that do not turn full control
[2:45:26.760 --> 2:45:28.760]  over to the globalist adl
[2:45:28.760 --> 2:45:30.760]  and they've called for a
[2:45:30.760 --> 2:45:32.760]  complete purge of anyone
[2:45:32.760 --> 2:45:34.760]  promoting americana
[2:45:34.760 --> 2:45:36.760]  we are being demoralized, we are being conquered
[2:45:36.760 --> 2:45:38.760]  and the enemy wants to shut info wars
[2:45:38.760 --> 2:45:40.760]  down because they understand
[2:45:40.760 --> 2:45:42.760]  that we've got their number and know how to defeat their paradigm
[2:45:42.760 --> 2:45:44.760]  you have helped keep us on the
[2:45:44.760 --> 2:45:46.760]  air but now the attacks are more

[2:47:54.760 --> 2:47:56.760]  he had a big ol plane
[2:47:56.760 --> 2:47:58.760]  the lonely express
[2:47:58.760 --> 2:48:00.760]  had its doors
[2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:02.760]  and no secret service
[2:48:02.760 --> 2:48:05.100]  But the fans know who flew
[2:48:05.100 --> 2:48:07.380]  And that's why he didn't kill himself

[2:48:41.480 --> 2:48:43.480]  Christmas lights and drywall
[2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:45.480]  These things don't hang themselves

[2:49:05.480 --> 2:49:07.480]  We had a master plan

[2:49:09.480 --> 2:49:11.480]  Eugenics and Gisling
[2:49:11.480 --> 2:49:14.480]  That is New Mexico Place

[2:49:28.480 --> 2:49:31.480]  He was the victim of the Eugenics
[2:49:31.480 --> 2:49:55.480]  It's every afternoon, killin' self!

[2:50:06.480 --> 2:50:09.480]  On the whole house of cards coming down
[2:50:09.480 --> 2:50:12.480]  On the next Epstein shoe to drop
[2:50:12.480 --> 2:50:14.480]  As the deep state begins to blackmail
[2:50:14.480 --> 2:50:17.480]  Each other over the multi-decades long
[2:50:17.480 --> 2:50:20.480]  Blackmail ring being run by

[2:50:26.480 --> 2:50:28.480]  Bill Gates has caught up in it
[2:50:28.480 --> 2:50:33.480]  The Clintons, everybody
[2:50:33.480 --> 2:50:35.480]  That's why they're so desperate to get rid of Trump
[2:50:35.480 --> 2:50:38.480]  Trump's not involved in it
[2:50:38.480 --> 2:50:39.480]  Trump isn't into that
[2:50:39.480 --> 2:50:43.480]  Plus he never put himself in that position
[2:50:43.480 --> 2:50:44.480]  That's why they're so scared
[2:50:44.480 --> 2:50:45.480]  That's why they're so desperate
[2:50:45.480 --> 2:50:47.480]  You've got the whole fake impeachment
[2:50:47.480 --> 2:50:51.480]  Saying, oh, Trump refuses to come to the
[2:50:51.480 --> 2:50:52.480]  Hearings in the house
[2:50:52.480 --> 2:50:53.480]  Cause it's all been a kangaroo
[2:50:53.480 --> 2:50:55.480]  They don't even know who the other witnesses are
[2:50:55.480 --> 2:50:56.480]  They weren't allowed to ask questions before
[2:50:56.480 --> 2:50:57.480]  The whole thing's a fraud
[2:50:57.480 --> 2:50:59.480]  And any proceeding that's been a fraud
[2:50:59.480 --> 2:51:02.480]  From the onset only gets legitimized
[2:51:02.480 --> 2:51:05.480]  By joining with it later
[2:51:05.480 --> 2:51:08.480]  That's all coming up
[2:51:08.480 --> 2:51:11.480]  Today as well
[2:51:11.480 --> 2:51:12.480]  A toll-free number to join us
[2:51:12.480 --> 2:51:13.480]  To cover any issue you want
[2:51:13.480 --> 2:51:15.480]  Long-time caller, first-time caller
[2:51:15.480 --> 2:51:17.480]  Disagree, agree
[2:51:17.480 --> 2:51:28.480]  Any subject you want to discuss?
[2:51:28.480 --> 2:51:33.480]  877-789-2539-8777-89 Alex
[2:51:33.480 --> 2:51:39.480]  877-789-2539-8777-89 Alex
[2:51:39.480 --> 2:51:44.480]  Totally wide-open phones, but
[2:51:44.480 --> 2:51:46.480]  I always say this, I never do it
[2:51:46.480 --> 2:51:47.480]  We are just going to go to your call
[2:51:47.480 --> 2:51:48.480]  Get your point with the next person
[2:51:48.480 --> 2:51:51.480]  I'll never get to anybody
[2:51:51.480 --> 2:51:54.480]  Okay, I have covered a lot today
[2:51:54.480 --> 2:51:55.480]  That I haven't scratched the surface
[2:51:55.480 --> 2:52:09.480]  So let me be as judicious as I can
[2:52:09.480 --> 2:52:12.480]  We've been working on this story
[2:52:12.480 --> 2:52:20.480]  For over a month and a half
[2:52:20.480 --> 2:52:24.480]  And of course, if we put out the documents
[2:52:24.480 --> 2:52:27.480]  And put out a video, it's not even allowed on YouTube
[2:52:27.480 --> 2:52:29.480]  And the video we posted on Band-Aid video
[2:52:29.480 --> 2:52:30.480]  I think only had like 50,000 views
[2:52:30.480 --> 2:52:35.480]  Which still didn't chop liver
[2:52:35.480 --> 2:52:37.480]  But hey, UN Connected Group
[2:52:37.480 --> 2:52:39.480]  Begins microchipping of Austin Homeless
[2:52:39.480 --> 2:52:41.480]  Here's the documents, here's the admissions
[2:52:41.480 --> 2:52:43.480]  They've already done it in Latin America
[2:52:43.480 --> 2:52:46.480]  Nobody cares, it's confirmed, it's bombshell
[2:52:46.480 --> 2:52:47.480]  It's insane
[2:52:47.480 --> 2:52:50.480]  As of the beginning of the show
[2:52:50.480 --> 2:52:51.480]  This morning when I was watching it
[2:52:51.480 --> 2:52:53.480]  It had 1.2 million views
[2:52:53.480 --> 2:52:58.480]  When they printed this, it had another 100,000 views
[2:52:58.480 --> 2:53:00.480]  Let's see what it's got now
[2:53:00.480 --> 2:53:02.480]  Because the folks videotaping this
[2:53:02.480 --> 2:53:05.480]  They know this guy, they're friends with him
[2:53:05.480 --> 2:53:06.480]  This is actually where I get my haircut
[2:53:06.480 --> 2:53:07.480]  Don't want to give out too much
[2:53:07.480 --> 2:53:08.480]  But I do get my haircut there
[2:53:08.480 --> 2:53:10.480]  Because my grandpa used to get his haircut there
[2:53:10.480 --> 2:53:12.480]  At the old location, it's still open
[2:53:12.480 --> 2:53:15.480]  South Austin Barbershop
[2:53:15.480 --> 2:53:20.480]  Homeless gentleman's amazing barbershop transformation
[2:53:20.480 --> 2:53:22.480]  Of course the other videos have a few thousand views
[2:53:22.480 --> 2:53:24.480]  You know why this one has so many views
[2:53:24.480 --> 2:53:25.480]  Can we pull that up?
[2:53:25.480 --> 2:53:28.480]  Here, I can do it on my phone
[2:53:28.480 --> 2:53:32.480]  It's because he talks about how they're living in a warehouse
[2:53:32.480 --> 2:53:39.480]  And getting microchips
[2:53:39.480 --> 2:53:41.480]  Here, just do a document cam shot
[2:53:41.480 --> 2:53:42.480]  That'll work this way
[2:53:42.480 --> 2:53:55.480]  So just think about that
[2:53:55.480 --> 2:53:56.480]  But everybody's freaking out
[2:53:56.480 --> 2:53:59.480]  Because he's in a video not about the microchipping
[2:53:59.480 --> 2:54:01.480]  Maybe it got through the Google filters
[2:54:01.480 --> 2:54:05.480]  Because it's, oh, amazing gentleman's
[2:54:05.480 --> 2:54:07.480]  Barbershop transformation
[2:54:07.480 --> 2:54:09.480]  Oh, my gosh
[2:54:09.480 --> 2:54:12.480]  Went up on the 27th, only went viral today
[2:54:12.480 --> 2:54:14.480]  It probably has two million views now
[2:54:14.480 --> 2:54:17.480]  Here, let me pull it up on my phone
[2:54:17.480 --> 2:54:22.480]  So it's just incredible
[2:54:22.480 --> 2:54:25.480]  There, let's do it
[2:54:25.480 --> 2:54:26.480]  There it is
[2:54:26.480 --> 2:54:29.480]  So now it has 1,423,000
[2:54:29.480 --> 2:54:30.480]  So in the last couple of hours
[2:54:30.480 --> 2:54:33.480]  It's got another 100,000 views
[2:54:33.480 --> 2:54:35.480]  And of course everybody's talking about how it's
[2:54:35.480 --> 2:54:39.480]  The microchipping and how they're moving them into a warehouse
[2:54:39.480 --> 2:54:40.480]  Which is all confirmed
[2:54:40.480 --> 2:54:43.480]  And we have the documents but no one cares
[2:54:43.480 --> 2:54:48.480]  I was telling the crew about this this weekend
[2:54:48.480 --> 2:54:49.480]  I said, it's crazy
[2:54:49.480 --> 2:54:51.480]  When we have all the proof
[2:54:51.480 --> 2:54:53.480]  And it's totally admitted no one cares
[2:54:53.480 --> 2:54:56.480]  But if it's a mystery or, oh, it's hidden in something else
[2:54:56.480 --> 2:54:59.480]  Then it's the biggest thing since sliced bread
[2:54:59.480 --> 2:55:03.480]  And I don't care that somebody else's YouTube channel
[2:55:03.480 --> 2:55:06.480]  Got 1.4 million views, in fact, I love it
[2:55:06.480 --> 2:55:09.480]  I get my hair cut there in that very Barbershop
[2:55:09.480 --> 2:55:10.480]  I told you I go to a Barbershop
[2:55:10.480 --> 2:55:12.480]  That's mainly a minority Barbershop
[2:55:12.480 --> 2:55:14.480]  It's just quick, easy, they're nice guys
[2:55:14.480 --> 2:55:16.480]  And my grandpa, you know, was going there
[2:55:16.480 --> 2:55:18.480]  When the old owner had it open since like the 60s
[2:55:18.480 --> 2:55:22.480]  But I'm into tradition
[2:55:22.480 --> 2:55:26.480]  But see how we break that over a month ago
[2:55:26.480 --> 2:55:28.480]  And have videos about it and articles about it
[2:55:28.480 --> 2:55:30.480]  And show the documents and no one cares
[2:55:30.480 --> 2:55:34.480]  It's like, that's just, you know, that's just Joe's big deal, you know
[2:55:34.480 --> 2:55:38.480]  Implant the homeless
[2:55:38.480 --> 2:55:43.480]  But he's just up there nonchalantly talking about it all
[2:55:43.480 --> 2:55:46.480]  About, yeah, you know, they're moving us into this warehouse
[2:55:46.480 --> 2:55:48.480]  We're getting microchips so we're all safe
[2:55:48.480 --> 2:55:53.480]  And everything's free and everything's taken care of
[2:55:53.480 --> 2:55:55.480]  And everybody is totally freaked out about this
[2:55:55.480 --> 2:55:57.480]  You gotta read the comments, they're just like, oh my god, it's all true
[2:55:57.480 --> 2:55:58.480]  This is insane
[2:55:58.480 --> 2:56:02.480]  Of course it's going on, it's going on all over the damn planet
[2:56:02.480 --> 2:56:04.480]  We're gonna go to break
[2:56:04.480 --> 2:56:06.480]  And I'm gonna play some of that audio coming up
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:08.480]  And we're gonna take your phone calls
[2:56:08.480 --> 2:56:10.480]  And I'm gonna get into all these other news items I haven't hit yet
[2:56:10.480 --> 2:56:12.480]  And believe me there's a lot of them
[2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:15.480]  The head of YouTube
[2:56:15.480 --> 2:56:18.480]  Comes out and says, well the scary part about conspiracy says
[2:56:18.480 --> 2:56:21.480]  We have to counsel our moderators, they're believing it
[2:56:21.480 --> 2:56:27.480]  It's so dangerous, they're believing that it's not true that men can't have babies
[2:56:27.480 --> 2:56:32.480]  Alex Jones says men can't have babies and we have to ban him
[2:56:32.480 --> 2:56:34.480]  He's crazy
[2:56:34.480 --> 2:56:37.480]  Leslie Stahl's like, you're right, men can have babies
[2:56:37.480 --> 2:56:41.480]  Because they've got to have the mental illness out in the open and get you to accept it
[2:56:41.480 --> 2:56:43.480]  And pedophiles have access to your children
[2:56:43.480 --> 2:56:47.480]  Yes they do, pedophiles are good, they're liberal
[2:56:47.480 --> 2:56:49.480]  Whatever you do, let's beat these people
[2:56:49.480 --> 2:56:52.480]  And it's word of mouth and information warfare that does it
[2:56:52.480 --> 2:56:57.480]  So take the live feed from band.video of the show today
[2:56:57.480 --> 2:57:01.480]  Send out that URL and infowars.com.forge.show
[2:57:01.480 --> 2:57:05.480]  That gets censored everywhere, so send out newswars.com.forge.show
[2:57:05.480 --> 2:57:08.480]  That URL isn't banned yet, I'm sure it will be
[2:57:08.480 --> 2:57:13.480]  newswars.com.forge.show
[2:57:13.480 --> 2:57:16.480]  So that people out there who don't know what's going on
[2:57:16.480 --> 2:57:19.480]  And are just getting conditioned can tune in and find out why it's happening
[2:57:19.480 --> 2:57:23.480]  And who's behind it and see the proof because they fear this broadcast
[2:57:23.480 --> 2:57:27.480]  They fear the guest, they fear you, they fear this crew, they fear what we're doing
[2:57:27.480 --> 2:57:30.480]  Because we're not intimidated and we're not backing down
[2:57:30.480 --> 2:57:34.480]  And we've bloodied their political noses over and over again
[2:57:34.480 --> 2:57:38.480]  And now we're going in for the kill!
[2:57:38.480 --> 2:57:44.480]  L1 number four straight ahead!
[2:57:44.480 --> 2:57:49.480]  I spend a lot of time reminding the infowars, the family of listeners and viewers
[2:57:49.480 --> 2:57:53.480]  That without you we won't be on the air
[2:57:53.480 --> 2:57:55.480]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you
[2:57:55.480 --> 2:57:58.480]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air
[2:57:58.480 --> 2:58:02.480]  And really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres
[2:58:02.480 --> 2:58:06.480]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you
[2:58:06.480 --> 2:58:09.480]  That these products are really amazing
[2:58:09.480 --> 2:58:13.480]  You've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third party test out there
[2:58:13.480 --> 2:58:15.480]  The water filtration, the water filtration
[2:58:15.480 --> 2:58:19.480]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there
[2:58:19.480 --> 2:58:25.480]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard
[2:58:25.480 --> 2:58:28.480]  So it's not a burden to support infowars
[2:58:28.480 --> 2:58:33.480]  It really is something that is good for everybody
[2:58:33.480 --> 2:58:35.480]  That stands for justice and freedom
[2:58:35.480 --> 2:58:39.480]  And makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better

[2:59:46.480 --> 2:59:53.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:59:53.480 --> 3:00:05.480]  All right folks we're gonna come back to your phone calls and get more into the chipping of the Austin homeless community
[3:00:05.480 --> 3:00:26.480]  Let's go to Smart Grads with Google after the break but here's this report
[3:00:26.480 --> 3:00:36.480]  InfoWars the most banned network in the world
[3:00:56.480 --> 3:01:00.480]  We're in a symbiotic relationship they're linked up
[3:01:00.480 --> 3:01:05.480]  Now if we pull back and we look at what Hollywood's doing, what the universities are doing
[3:01:05.480 --> 3:01:12.480]  Not just here but all over the world there is a unified effort to sabotage the family
[3:01:12.480 --> 3:01:17.480]  To sabotage culture, to get people into debt, to make people ill, to make them sick
[3:01:17.480 --> 3:01:20.480]  I mean it's all out in the open now
[3:01:20.480 --> 3:01:26.480]  There are a few countries like Russia are actively opposing that and saying hey too many vaccines are dangerous
[3:01:26.480 --> 3:01:31.480]  And hey GMO really is sterilizing people and hey don't try to break up families
[3:01:31.480 --> 3:01:36.480]  Don't try to sexualize children when they're in the elementary school that's evil
[3:01:36.480 --> 3:01:47.480]  And Russia has come out and pointed out that Hollywood and the EU and others are actually trying to poison society and destabilize it
[3:01:47.480 --> 3:01:52.480]  We don't need the Russians to tell us that to know it's true we can see it every day
[3:01:52.480 --> 3:01:59.480]  But we're always hearing that oh the Russians are behind Trump and the Russians are behind the fight against the EU
[3:01:59.480 --> 3:02:03.480]  And the Russians are behind the Nationalists in Brazil
[3:02:03.480 --> 3:02:09.480]  Well no not the Russians themselves but the spirit of not wanting to be slaves
[3:02:09.480 --> 3:02:13.480]  The spirit of wanting to have strong families, the spirit of wanting to have a good future
[3:02:13.480 --> 3:02:17.480]  The spirit of wanting to build a civilization that's good and wholesome
[3:02:17.480 --> 3:02:24.480]  Yes that spirit, that same spirit behind the Russians in their rebirth compared to where they were is driving us
[3:02:24.480 --> 3:02:31.480]  The Russians hit rock bottom after 70 plus years of leftist torture and enslavement
[3:02:31.480 --> 3:02:35.480]  And so they've seen the face of the technocracy
[3:02:35.480 --> 3:02:39.480]  We here haven't hit bottom yet and there's different ways to learn
[3:02:39.480 --> 3:02:48.480]  You know you can learn from experience, you can learn by being warned, being educated
[3:02:48.480 --> 3:02:53.480]  And you can also of course learn by revelation, revelation would be the best way wouldn't it
[3:02:53.480 --> 3:02:57.480]  From your own instincts, your own spirit, your own understanding and just follow what you know is right
[3:02:57.480 --> 3:02:59.480]  That voice is never wrong
[3:02:59.480 --> 3:03:04.480]  But we can live by experience and by education
[3:03:04.480 --> 3:03:10.480]  By experiencing globalism and the new world order and all the poison and all the curses and all the bad things that come with
[3:03:10.480 --> 3:03:18.480]  And we can read and learn from people like Alexander Silsenitsyn what they went through and say let's not do this again
[3:03:18.480 --> 3:03:26.480]  But to be able to do that we're going to need to get aggressive and not see fighting tyranny as warped
[3:03:26.480 --> 3:03:30.480]  But see it as breathing air into our lungs when we climb a hill
[3:03:30.480 --> 3:03:34.480]  And the more we do it the stronger we get and it becomes a compulsion to fight tyranny
[3:03:34.480 --> 3:03:37.480]  It becomes an enjoyment to fight tyranny
[3:03:37.480 --> 3:03:41.480]  Better than food, better than sex is fighting for our very survival
[3:03:41.480 --> 3:03:46.480]  Because if we don't fight for our territory and fight for our human will and fight for justice and fight for our children
[3:03:46.480 --> 3:03:52.480]  Well all the food and the sex and all the things God's given us to enjoy our lives with our husbands and wives won't mean anything
[3:03:52.480 --> 3:03:56.480]  But you notice they're trying to take our food and they're trying to take our sex away
[3:03:56.480 --> 3:04:01.480]  Our normal natural men and women because all of that is holy
[3:04:01.480 --> 3:04:04.480]  What does holy mean? It just means sacred?
[3:04:04.480 --> 3:04:08.480]  It just means what's good, what was meant from the beginning, what works
[3:04:08.480 --> 3:04:11.480]  What connects us to all those that came before us
[3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:17.480]  It's not human culture men and women and families, it's survival, it's who we are
[3:04:17.480 --> 3:04:22.480]  Forged in the fires and the frozen waste and the wars
[3:04:22.480 --> 3:04:28.480]  And all we've been through, all of us are the inheritors of that majesty
[3:04:28.480 --> 3:04:33.480]  And this incredible experience together and we're not going to let our species down and I know you aren't
[3:04:33.480 --> 3:04:38.480]  So spread the word about this broadcast however you can and buy those products that are great for you and your family
[3:04:38.480 --> 3:04:43.480]  That are symbiotic and together, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to march to the future
[3:04:43.480 --> 3:04:46.480]  We're going to fight this dehumanizing force, this tester
[3:04:46.480 --> 3:04:52.480]  And we're going to win with God's grace because God is good
[3:04:52.480 --> 3:04:57.480]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson
[3:04:57.480 --> 3:05:05.480]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[3:05:05.480 --> 3:05:07.480]  How far will they go? What's their limit?
[3:05:07.480 --> 3:05:14.480]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit
[3:05:14.480 --> 3:05:20.480]  The answer is there is no limit to evil, it is a bottomless pit
[3:05:20.480 --> 3:05:25.480]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist
[3:05:25.480 --> 3:05:29.480]  Or that there's no free will, there's no devil or the God
[3:05:29.480 --> 3:05:35.480]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress
[3:05:35.480 --> 3:05:39.480]  And where we can live and what our houses can be like
[3:05:39.480 --> 3:05:43.480]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us
[3:05:43.480 --> 3:05:45.480]  Oxford's banned clapping
[3:05:45.480 --> 3:05:48.480]  University of the U.S. of banned 21 guns salutes for veterans
[3:05:48.480 --> 3:06:14.480]  These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them
[3:06:18.480 --> 3:06:28.480]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide, your phone calls are coming up here
[3:06:28.480 --> 3:06:32.480]  Start of the next segment on this live Monday edition
[3:06:32.480 --> 3:06:36.480]  Only 336 days out from the election
[3:06:36.480 --> 3:06:40.480]  There's a big story up on infowars.com
[3:06:40.480 --> 3:06:48.480]  60 minutes, Google, YouTube took down 300 Trump ads
[3:06:48.480 --> 3:06:55.480]  That's right, CEO still claims the site doesn't target conservatives
[3:06:55.480 --> 3:06:59.480]  And of course they're now taking down photos of Melania Trump because that's seen as pro-Trump
[3:06:59.480 --> 3:07:05.480]  And Trump is hate speech and so anything supporting Trump is 86th
[3:07:05.480 --> 3:07:08.480]  But she says this is freedom of speech
[3:07:08.480 --> 3:07:12.480]  Just like Merkel said last week, she said
[3:07:12.480 --> 3:07:18.480]  The British Chancellor, the German Chancellor said
[3:07:18.480 --> 3:07:22.480]  We have to take people's freedom to protect freedom
[3:07:22.480 --> 3:07:28.480]  That's right, that's their system, that's how they operate
[3:07:28.480 --> 3:07:34.480]  They're making their move and if we don't say no to it and if we don't challenge it
[3:07:34.480 --> 3:07:38.480]  We're going into great tyranny and next will be the arrest of people for their speech
[3:07:38.480 --> 3:07:41.480]  Which is already happening in Europe and England and the UK, wide
[3:07:41.480 --> 3:07:57.480]  And it's now coming here
[3:07:57.480 --> 3:08:03.480]  And a lot of folks are like, well we'll just let these people run our lives
[3:08:03.480 --> 3:08:06.480]  And they say, well they want your kids and they want your health and they want your life
[3:08:06.480 --> 3:08:08.480]  And they want to run your mind
[3:08:08.480 --> 3:08:13.480]  And they found a bunch of corporate operatives that will do anything or say anything
[3:08:13.480 --> 3:08:19.480]  But the power structure, and then when the power structure is on its off time
[3:08:19.480 --> 3:08:23.480]  It's meeting in secret, having sex with children
[3:08:23.480 --> 3:08:32.480]  That's what went on at Jeffrey Epstein's operations
[3:08:32.480 --> 3:08:36.480]  People that stand up for free speech lose everything
[3:08:36.480 --> 3:08:43.480]  Land of the free, home of the brave, not for much longer
[3:08:43.480 --> 3:08:47.480]  If we as a civilization don't start saying no
[3:08:47.480 --> 3:08:51.480]  We better start having a conversation about how do we say no
[3:08:51.480 --> 3:08:56.480]  The globalists really want inflores off the air because we're saying this isn't right
[3:08:56.480 --> 3:09:01.480]  We need to organize and say no to this and these people are evil
[3:09:01.480 --> 3:09:04.480]  And they think if they can punish us and take us off the air
[3:09:04.480 --> 3:09:07.480]  That'll send a message to everybody else that, see you better shut your mouths
[3:09:07.480 --> 3:09:13.480]  But see I think you're like the people in Texas
[3:09:13.480 --> 3:09:19.480]  When the Mexican dictator who oppressed his own people who just lost Guatemala
[3:09:19.480 --> 3:09:22.480]  They rebelled against him
[3:09:22.480 --> 3:09:26.480]  Marched up here to take the firearms and to take people's private property
[3:09:26.480 --> 3:09:30.480]  That they had come and cleared and made valuable
[3:09:30.480 --> 3:09:33.480]  And defeated the Comanches
[3:09:33.480 --> 3:09:37.480]  There are only a few Spanish missions in Texas
[3:09:37.480 --> 3:09:42.480]  A couple thousand people lived in Texas in the 1820s
[3:09:42.480 --> 3:09:49.480]  And the Spanish Empire had given up on the southwest
[3:09:49.480 --> 3:09:53.480]  They had some ports in California and a few missions across the west
[3:09:53.480 --> 3:09:56.480]  With gun ports in the doors
[3:09:56.480 --> 3:10:00.480]  Go down and look at the missions in San Antonio, that's all that was down there
[3:10:00.480 --> 3:10:04.480]  And so when the Spanish got overthrown
[3:10:04.480 --> 3:10:10.480]  The Mexican government invited the settlers in because they had pushed the Native Americans out
[3:10:10.480 --> 3:10:14.480]  Who were completely war-like and constantly killing each other
[3:10:14.480 --> 3:10:19.480]  You want to see an accurate depiction to watch the Revenant, which is a true story
[3:10:19.480 --> 3:10:23.480]  And the real story is even crazier than what they put in that movie because you wouldn't believe it
[3:10:23.480 --> 3:10:27.480]  That's a true story, everything in it happened
[3:10:34.480 --> 3:10:40.480]  And it was every man for himself so nobody could conquer the west
[3:10:40.480 --> 3:10:47.480]  And so the Christian settlers were invited in because they would stand and fight
[3:10:47.480 --> 3:10:49.480]  And they did
[3:10:49.480 --> 3:10:54.480]  And the Comanches that were known as the Lord of the Plains that went around exterminating all the other Native Americans
[3:10:54.480 --> 3:11:00.480]  Got their asses handed to them in Texas and Oklahoma
[3:11:00.480 --> 3:11:04.480]  And then all the other Native American groups that had been hiding out
[3:11:04.480 --> 3:11:08.480]  In other states were able to come back in, other territories at the time
[3:11:08.480 --> 3:11:15.480]  But that's the real Thanksgiving-style story, that's the real stuff that went on
[3:11:15.480 --> 3:11:21.480]  But Santa Ana thought if he killed everybody at the Alamo
[3:11:21.480 --> 3:11:25.480]  Executed the only couple of survivors that would scare everybody
[3:11:25.480 --> 3:11:27.480]  And make them all turn tail and run
[3:11:27.480 --> 3:11:29.480]  Of course it did the opposite, it energized
[3:11:29.480 --> 3:11:32.480]  And then Santa Ana got defeated big time
[3:11:32.480 --> 3:11:35.480]  It changed the center
[3:11:35.480 --> 3:11:38.480]  And so whatever happens to Info Wars, I believe in you
[3:11:38.480 --> 3:11:41.480]  And I know you're not intimidated by these people
[3:11:41.480 --> 3:11:45.480]  In fact I know America and the world has been asleep
[3:11:54.480 --> 3:11:57.480]  And now you're getting woken up
[3:11:57.480 --> 3:12:00.480]  And the system now knows that so they're going with the old fear tactic
[3:12:00.480 --> 3:12:03.480]  Thinking that's why you were silent
[3:12:03.480 --> 3:12:06.480]  The truth is you were asleep, you were lazy
[3:12:06.480 --> 3:12:11.480]  You were distracted, there were so many diversions, so was I
[3:12:11.480 --> 3:12:14.480]  But once you found out what was really going on
[3:12:14.480 --> 3:12:15.480]  You decided to take action
[3:12:15.480 --> 3:12:17.480]  And so now they're trying to take every venue you can
[3:12:17.480 --> 3:12:20.480]  Hundreds and hundreds of millions of people's accounts
[3:12:20.480 --> 3:12:27.480]  Have been taken down on Facebook
[3:12:27.480 --> 3:12:30.480]  Everybody's being silenced
[3:12:30.480 --> 3:12:33.480]  And these people are rolling up their sleeves
[3:12:33.480 --> 3:12:36.480]  They made the decision that oh whatever got Trump elected
[3:12:36.480 --> 3:12:39.480]  We've got to go after it, we've got to destroy
[3:12:39.480 --> 3:12:43.480]  We've got to level, these are quotes from CNN, MSNBC
[3:12:43.480 --> 3:12:46.480]  Everyone that doesn't submit to us
[3:12:46.480 --> 3:12:49.480]  And they've got this happy go lucky fake liberal operating system
[3:12:49.480 --> 3:12:52.480]  That it's about equality and it's about love
[3:12:52.480 --> 3:12:54.480]  And that's why they're censoring
[3:12:54.480 --> 3:12:57.480]  When it's big, hardcore, ruthless corporations
[3:12:57.480 --> 3:12:59.480]  Replacing humans with robots
[3:12:59.480 --> 3:13:04.480]  Who absolutely hate humanity and it's all a bunch of old men
[3:13:04.480 --> 3:13:07.480]  That run it with the communist Chinese
[3:13:07.480 --> 3:13:10.480]  But they've got all these women
[3:13:10.480 --> 3:13:13.480]  That grow up in the lap of American freedom
[3:13:13.480 --> 3:13:17.480]  Who are the front people
[3:13:17.480 --> 3:13:20.480]  They've got a few men in there like Sundar Pichai
[3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:23.480]  Who are captaining the censorship and the control
[3:13:23.480 --> 3:13:26.480]  And telling us how it's all for a greater good
[3:13:26.480 --> 3:13:30.480]  China introduces mandatory face scans for phone users
[3:13:30.480 --> 3:13:35.480]  Amazon warehouse, cult-like sweatshops run by robots
[3:13:35.480 --> 3:13:39.480]  New York Post
[3:13:39.480 --> 3:13:42.480]  They've got new systems where you're locked in a cage
[3:13:42.480 --> 3:13:45.480]  And the robot tells you what to do
[3:13:45.480 --> 3:13:48.480]  Amazon has patented a system that would put workers
[3:13:48.480 --> 3:13:52.480]  In a cage on top of a robot
[3:13:52.480 --> 3:13:56.480]  Who runs Thunderdome
[3:13:56.480 --> 3:14:01.480]  Master Blaster runs Thunderdome, but now
[3:14:01.480 --> 3:14:06.480]  It's a big robot with a big claw like those arcade games
[3:14:06.480 --> 3:14:11.480]  Where you put the money in and then it grabs a toy
[3:14:11.480 --> 3:14:14.480]  And of course we've got nice Chinese communist cages
[3:14:14.480 --> 3:14:16.480]  For people that don't have a good social score
[3:14:16.480 --> 3:14:20.480]  You get locked up and tortured into a reeducation camp
[3:14:20.480 --> 3:14:26.480]  And that's okay, it's liberal
[3:14:26.480 --> 3:14:30.480]  In the new Disney Frozen 2
[3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:35.480]  It's Northern Inuit or like Chinese
[3:14:35.480 --> 3:14:39.480]  That's what the Inuits are, Ice Age Chinese
[3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:44.480]  And they teach the evil white men how bad they are
[3:14:44.480 --> 3:14:47.480]  And they take over and it's all peace
[3:14:47.480 --> 3:14:50.480]  It's a lesbian queen
[3:14:50.480 --> 3:14:53.480]  The lesbian queen of YouTube
[3:14:53.480 --> 3:14:57.480]  And the lesbian queen of this and the lesbian queen of that
[3:14:57.480 --> 3:14:59.480]  And it's all just a weird operating system
[3:14:59.480 --> 3:15:02.480]  As if the lesbian queens run anything
[3:15:02.480 --> 3:15:05.480]  It's an AI demonic takeover
[3:15:05.480 --> 3:15:11.480]  The end of civilization
[3:15:11.480 --> 3:15:14.480]  And the Praetorian Guard trick the mass of the public
[3:15:14.480 --> 3:15:18.480]  To destroy the damn, the evil white man's damn of civilization
[3:15:18.480 --> 3:15:20.480]  And take it down so the third world doesn't get technology
[3:15:20.480 --> 3:15:23.480]  And starve to death, oh it's so liberal
[3:15:23.480 --> 3:15:25.480]  Oh it's so trendy
[3:15:25.480 --> 3:15:28.480]  Oh it's so good, oh it's so sweet
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:34.480]  It's all lies, all poisonous garbage
[3:15:34.480 --> 3:15:36.480]  Alright we're gonna come back, go to your phone calls

[3:17:49.480 --> 3:18:17.480]  I spend a lot of time reminding the In FullWars family of listeners and viewers
[3:18:17.480 --> 3:18:20.480]  You've got that pledge from me
[3:18:20.480 --> 3:18:22.480]  But you've seen the third-party test out there
[3:18:22.480 --> 3:18:24.480]  The air filtration, the water filtration
[3:18:24.480 --> 3:18:27.480]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there

[3:18:52.480 --> 3:18:55.480]  Major report out of major university
[3:18:55.480 --> 3:18:59.480]  Researchers working on food-based treatment to slow aging science daily
[3:18:59.480 --> 3:19:02.480]  Probiotics in the gut of a particular type
[3:19:02.480 --> 3:19:05.480]  Caused your entire body to be healthier and make you live longer
[3:19:05.480 --> 3:19:07.480]  And make you not get intestinal cancer
[3:19:07.480 --> 3:19:10.480]  We have the very best formula, literally, with what they even mentioned in the studies
[3:19:10.480 --> 3:19:14.480]  And it explains the hormone called FGF21
[3:19:14.480 --> 3:19:17.480]  Prolonggevity heals the entire body
[3:19:17.480 --> 3:19:22.480]  And actually reverses aging, but is only made in the lower intestine
[3:19:22.480 --> 3:19:23.480]  Oh, and what does it say?
[3:19:23.480 --> 3:19:28.480]  It's fiber from a spectrum of certain types of berries that grows this
[3:19:28.480 --> 3:19:30.480]  And yes, this is a plug, gut fusion
[3:19:30.480 --> 3:19:32.480]  And what do we have in this?
[3:19:32.480 --> 3:19:34.480]  High auric berry blend
[3:19:34.480 --> 3:19:39.480]  Strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, cranberry, escoblio, grape, and pomegranate
[3:19:39.480 --> 3:19:42.480]  It's the pulp from them that then grows this
[3:19:42.480 --> 3:19:46.480]  Gut fusion for children, for young people, for old people, for everybody
[3:19:46.480 --> 3:19:48.480]  This is fiber and glutamine
[3:19:48.480 --> 3:19:49.480]  You're not going to find a better formula
[3:19:49.480 --> 3:19:50.480]  Gut fusion, it's amazing
[3:19:50.480 --> 3:20:18.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:20:18.480 --> 3:20:20.480]  We're taking your phone calls
[3:20:20.480 --> 3:20:26.480]  We've got James, Trish, George, Matt, Brandon, Judy, Troy, Chase, Pastor Sam, and many others
[3:20:26.480 --> 3:20:29.480]  Let's go to who disagrees first here, James and Ohio
[3:20:29.480 --> 3:20:32.480]  Thanks for calling in on this live Monday edition
[3:20:32.480 --> 3:20:33.480]  Go ahead
[3:20:33.480 --> 3:20:40.480]  Hey, Alex, on a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you trust Trump?
[3:20:40.480 --> 3:20:46.480]  I'd say I trust Trump about 7 on a scale of 10
[3:20:46.480 --> 3:20:49.480]  I mean, I got two quotes
[3:20:49.480 --> 3:20:53.480]  The first quote is, I back Trump 100%
[3:20:53.480 --> 3:20:58.480]  The other quote is, Julian Assange is Hillary Clinton's butt plug
[3:20:58.480 --> 3:21:01.480]  Now, who did those quotes come from?
[3:21:01.480 --> 3:21:02.480]  Well, they came from me
[3:21:02.480 --> 3:21:04.480]  You sound like a libtard
[3:21:04.480 --> 3:21:05.480]  Well, actually, I'm not
[3:21:05.480 --> 3:21:13.480]  I'm definitely behind what you would call conservative or the liberals of the past of the 1990s
[3:21:13.480 --> 3:21:16.480]  Let me just address each little thing you put out there
[3:21:16.480 --> 3:21:18.480]  As if, you know, I'm just going to go off the air now
[3:21:18.480 --> 3:21:21.480]  I'm going to quit because you called in and said that
[3:21:21.480 --> 3:21:25.480]  Obviously, when I'm talking about backing Trump 100% on getting out of the TPP
[3:21:25.480 --> 3:21:27.480]  Backing Trump 100% on building a wall
[3:21:27.480 --> 3:21:29.480]  And the fact that we should have a sovereign nation
[3:21:29.480 --> 3:21:32.480]  I think I trust myself, you know, about 8 out of 10
[3:21:32.480 --> 3:21:34.480]  Because I'm a sinful person, I'm not perfect
[3:21:34.480 --> 3:21:36.480]  We make mistakes
[3:21:36.480 --> 3:21:38.480]  I mean, you know, sometimes I'm angry at by 8 o'clock at night
[3:21:38.480 --> 3:21:40.480]  Sometimes I'm in a great mood at 8 o'clock at night
[3:21:40.480 --> 3:21:43.480]  I mean, we're all flawed creatures
[3:21:43.480 --> 3:21:47.480]  So to act like it's bad to say that I don't completely trust Trump
[3:21:47.480 --> 3:21:51.480]  Because he's an infallible human, he's not infallible
[3:21:51.480 --> 3:21:55.480]  And then you'd better damn well believe in time and space
[3:21:55.480 --> 3:21:59.480]  That I was mad about WikiLeaks
[3:21:59.480 --> 3:22:01.480]  I've told that story, that's all over the news
[3:22:01.480 --> 3:22:06.480]  I said that, it's not like you called in with some super powerful nugget of hidden gold
[3:22:06.480 --> 3:22:11.480]  That you found and now I've been totally destroyed by your incredible gravitas
[3:22:11.480 --> 3:22:15.480]  I said, back when he wasn't releasing the dirt on Hillary
[3:22:15.480 --> 3:22:18.480]  That I wanted to see, that they said they had
[3:22:18.480 --> 3:22:21.480]  That I called him Hillary Clinton's butt plug at 3 a.m.
[3:22:21.480 --> 3:22:24.480]  When he didn't release anything the night they said they were
[3:22:24.480 --> 3:22:26.480]  And I've told that story over and over again to point out
[3:22:26.480 --> 3:22:30.480]  That Roger Stone didn't have any secret contact with Julian Assange
[3:22:30.480 --> 3:22:33.480]  The way the media spun it because I was there and I know what was going on
[3:22:33.480 --> 3:22:36.480]  So you're attempted to discredit me at the outset of what you were going to say
[3:22:36.480 --> 3:22:38.480]  Does not do anything but discredit you
[3:22:38.480 --> 3:22:39.480]  Now go ahead
[3:22:39.480 --> 3:22:48.480]  So my point would be is there are many, many pictures, many videos of Donald Trump with Jeffrey Epstein
[3:22:48.480 --> 3:22:53.480]  Now if you say what you did, I didn't know anything about Trump before he ran for president
[3:22:53.480 --> 3:22:55.480]  I didn't care
[3:22:55.480 --> 3:22:58.480]  So you're saying you were totally open about that
[3:22:58.480 --> 3:23:05.480]  But yet you back him 100% and yet you called Julian Assange Hillary Clinton's butt plug
[3:23:05.480 --> 3:23:12.480]  The only reason Trump got in was because people like yourself, people like friends of yours
[3:23:12.480 --> 3:23:16.480]  Reported what WikiLeaks actually gave out to the public
[3:23:16.480 --> 3:23:20.480]  Okay, listen, listen, you've called before with this same weird argument
[3:23:20.480 --> 3:23:22.480]  I appreciate your call, take care
[3:23:22.480 --> 3:23:26.480]  I'm not going to have little, like I've got a fever and I'm hallucinating
[3:23:26.480 --> 3:23:28.480]  I talk to you liberals, none of it makes sense
[3:23:28.480 --> 3:23:33.480]  You'll always obsess on some word and then like build a whole universe out of that
[3:23:33.480 --> 3:23:38.480]  It's weird, it's weird, okay
[3:23:38.480 --> 3:23:42.480]  I've been supporter of Assange back when he was leasing information 10 years ago
[3:23:42.480 --> 3:23:47.480]  I was mad at night and said that about him and I don't apologize for it
[3:23:47.480 --> 3:23:51.480]  I was saying he was holding in all of Hillary's dirt
[3:23:51.480 --> 3:23:55.480]  So it's an allegory, it's a joke
[3:23:55.480 --> 3:23:59.480]  You understand, I've called for Julian Assange to be released
[3:23:59.480 --> 3:24:01.480]  I've gone and bullhorned the White House
[3:24:01.480 --> 3:24:04.480]  I've gotten petition sent to the president
[3:24:04.480 --> 3:24:08.480]  But it's about you and the left having the moral authority
[3:24:08.480 --> 3:24:15.480]  Because it's a weird ism you have where you go, oh, you didn't support Assange, you did this
[3:24:15.480 --> 3:24:18.480]  What does that mean? It means nothing
[3:24:18.480 --> 3:24:21.480]  I support the press, I did not arrest the press
[3:24:21.480 --> 3:24:27.480]  Or whistleblowers like your god who lost Hillary Clinton in the Obama administration
[3:24:27.480 --> 3:24:30.480]  So I just will not have false debates with you
[3:24:30.480 --> 3:24:34.480]  I went to you first, you said you disagreed about Trump on Epstein
[3:24:34.480 --> 3:24:39.480]  What I said was I didn't really follow Trump until he was running
[3:24:39.480 --> 3:24:42.480]  Then I went and did a bunch of research, it's my full quote
[3:24:42.480 --> 3:24:47.480]  I didn't care about Trump, I thought he was a cheesy reality star
[3:24:47.480 --> 3:24:52.480]  Until I started to hear what he actually stood for, then I went and researched, even looked at his dad being a John Berger
[3:24:52.480 --> 3:24:56.480]  The quotes he'd said on TV about wanting to have better trade deals, all of that
[3:24:56.480 --> 3:24:59.480]  And then I got behind Trump and I'm proud I did, okay
[3:24:59.480 --> 3:25:06.480]  My criticism of Trump is not some chink in the armor you found so you call in trying to make me turn against Trump
[3:25:06.480 --> 3:25:11.480]  We put Trump in office, he belongs to us, he needs to stand up against the censorship
[3:25:11.480 --> 3:25:14.480]  He needs to stand up against the globalist, that's what I'm doing
[3:25:14.480 --> 3:25:20.480]  Not, not, oh I'm buckling under liberal acumen and liberal mental gravitas
[3:25:20.480 --> 3:25:26.480]  And you've really taught me who I am and oh, you did that psychological warfare thing right there
[3:25:26.480 --> 3:25:30.480]  No, it's pathetic what you did, it's a joke
[3:25:30.480 --> 3:25:35.480]  Your mental midgetry gave me a headache
[3:25:35.480 --> 3:25:39.480]  I could dissect everything you said
[3:25:39.480 --> 3:25:44.480]  I talked about Epstein before he even got busted 12 years ago
[3:25:44.480 --> 3:25:50.480]  We've pioneered in a mass media forum exposing the truth about how these blackmail rings operate
[3:25:50.480 --> 3:25:59.480]  How you with some sick form of libtard alchemy turned that into I'm covering up for Epstein when we are the fount
[3:25:59.480 --> 3:26:07.480]  One of the main headwaters, one of the main epicenters, the progenitors
[3:26:07.480 --> 3:26:11.480]  Of the genesis of this understanding
[3:26:11.480 --> 3:26:18.480]  And then you turn it into I'm covering up for it, that's libtard logic, great job, you failed
[3:26:18.480 --> 3:26:26.480]  When I looked into Trump I found that he'd had public events, parties he throws as a public figure that Epstein attended
[3:26:26.480 --> 3:26:33.480]  On video we have him one time where they made a couple photos and we have him criticizing him many, many years ago
[3:26:33.480 --> 3:26:35.480]  Once he found out how creepy he was
[3:26:35.480 --> 3:26:38.480]  Hillary flew on the plane, Clinton did
[3:26:38.480 --> 3:26:44.480]  I, with our great listeners, got hundreds of people to confront Bill Clinton and call him a rapist in my name
[3:26:44.480 --> 3:26:51.480]  Putting my John Hancock on him and you're so pissed we wounded your princess, your god, your lord, your queen
[3:26:51.480 --> 3:27:00.480]  Your master, your Lilith, your Medusa, your Gorgon, your Jezebel, your Delilah, your demon witch
[3:27:00.480 --> 3:27:03.480]  May she burn in hell for the trillion eternities
[3:27:03.480 --> 3:27:10.480]  I piss on your god, Hillary, I crap on her, I hope she burns in hell
[3:27:10.480 --> 3:27:12.480]  Excuse me, lord, I'm in a lot of control, excuse me
[3:27:12.480 --> 3:27:21.480]  So there, literally, I desecrate your goddess, I stomp on her, I've sped at her, forever
[3:27:21.480 --> 3:27:24.480]  Ha ha ha, take that
[3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:33.480]  I mean, you just hear the weakness and the tempering and the weird little collection he had to try to distort and upend reality
[3:27:33.480 --> 3:27:41.480]  You failed, Lebtard, you failed seminar caller, you failed
[3:27:41.480 --> 3:27:49.480]  We put Trump in office as a shield against you and it's, he's defeated you on so many fronts and it's beautiful
[3:27:49.480 --> 3:27:52.480]  But I want to make sure he goes in for the kill
[3:27:52.480 --> 3:28:01.480]  And so I want my audience with big long spiritual whips to drive Trump towards his destiny to drive the enemy off a cliff
[3:28:01.480 --> 3:28:08.480]  And if we all go over the top of the cliff with the enemy as we fall, we've gotten them off the backs of our children and that's a good mission politically
[3:28:08.480 --> 3:28:12.480]  Wish no violence, of course, that's all, an allegory
[3:28:12.480 --> 3:28:28.480]  This is information war and Hillary's fallen, your god you worshiped and put everything into is failed and no amount of Hollywood trash and devil worship and satanic rituals conducted nationwide in her name can ever resurrect her
[3:28:28.480 --> 3:28:38.480]  Hillary is a failure, Hillary is a liar, Hillary is a defender of child molesters and Hillary is a demon
[3:28:38.480 --> 3:28:44.480]  And the stench of her evil work goes on forever but she will pay for it
[3:28:44.480 --> 3:29:10.480]  More phone calls straight ahead, we'll be back, stay with us

[3:30:52.480 --> 3:30:54.480]  Infowarstore.com
[3:30:54.480 --> 3:30:58.480]  We have a new product and we got several thousand of these in
[3:30:58.480 --> 3:31:00.480]  And they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them
[3:31:00.480 --> 3:31:02.480]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it
[3:31:02.480 --> 3:31:05.480]  But this really is a game-changing toothpaste
[3:31:05.480 --> 3:31:11.480]  And it doesn't compete with Super Blue that's 4-5 of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free
[3:31:11.480 --> 3:31:13.480]  The adult or the children's
[3:31:13.480 --> 3:31:15.480]  These are both excellent toothpaste
[3:31:15.480 --> 3:31:17.480]  Concentrates that don't have fillers
[3:31:17.480 --> 3:31:18.480]  People love it
[3:31:18.480 --> 3:31:22.480]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium
[3:31:22.480 --> 3:31:26.480]  That also cleans but also re-mineralizes the teeth
[3:31:26.480 --> 3:31:29.480]  Then it has the patented silver salt
[3:31:29.480 --> 3:31:32.480]  Silver in it to knock out the bacteria that causes ginsivitis
[3:31:32.480 --> 3:31:34.480]  This is all proven, you can make claims with this
[3:31:34.480 --> 3:31:38.480]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good
[3:31:38.480 --> 3:31:41.480]  For knocking out the bacteria, the viruses
[3:31:41.480 --> 3:31:43.480]  And cleaning the teeth in a healthy way
[3:31:43.480 --> 3:31:46.480]  That doesn't strip away the enamel
[3:31:46.480 --> 3:31:48.480]  So we're really proud of it, it funds the operation
[3:31:48.480 --> 3:31:50.480]  Infowarstore.com
[3:31:50.480 --> 3:31:53.480]  That's why we're still on air, thanks to you
[3:31:53.480 --> 3:31:57.480]  Beto O'Rourke came out dozens of times and said
[3:31:57.480 --> 3:31:59.480]  We're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles
[3:31:59.480 --> 3:32:02.480]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage
[3:32:02.480 --> 3:32:05.480]  Nine others to agree and said that he was a hero
[3:32:05.480 --> 3:32:07.480]  Think about that
[3:32:07.480 --> 3:32:10.480]  Those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control
[3:32:10.480 --> 3:32:13.480]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes
[3:32:13.480 --> 3:32:17.480]  Covered with needles and with massive drug dealing
[3:32:17.480 --> 3:32:20.480]  And incredible levels of violent crime
[3:32:20.480 --> 3:32:22.480]  They know what they're doing
[3:32:22.480 --> 3:32:24.480]  And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that
[3:32:24.480 --> 3:32:27.480]  Gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion
[3:32:27.480 --> 3:32:30.480]  For what criminals do using their firearms
[3:32:30.480 --> 3:32:32.480]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen
[3:32:32.480 --> 3:32:34.480]  This country is under such incredible attack
[3:32:34.480 --> 3:32:37.480]  More and more towns and cities are saying
[3:32:37.480 --> 3:32:39.480]  They're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment
[3:32:39.480 --> 3:32:41.480]  And they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights
[3:32:41.480 --> 3:32:43.480]  And Constitution and they're not going to help
[3:32:43.480 --> 3:32:45.480]  In the confiscation of guns
[3:32:45.480 --> 3:32:48.480]  So you see, a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens
[3:32:48.480 --> 3:33:15.480]  Well, we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws
[3:33:15.480 --> 3:33:20.480]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty
[3:33:20.480 --> 3:33:23.480]  It's Alex Jones
[3:33:23.480 --> 3:33:25.480]  You can really see God's plan at work
[3:33:25.480 --> 3:33:28.480]  We've had a lot of infiltration, a lot of sabotage, a lot of betrayal
[3:33:28.480 --> 3:33:32.480]  But for all those evil doors that get opened, God opens other doors
[3:33:32.480 --> 3:33:35.480]  And it equalizes out
[3:33:35.480 --> 3:33:37.480]  That's how the universe really works
[3:33:37.480 --> 3:33:40.480]  Not just in Newtonian physics, I see it every day
[3:33:40.480 --> 3:33:43.480]  That's why they want you locked up in your houses
[3:33:43.480 --> 3:33:47.480]  Not out-engaged in the world, not exposing corruption
[3:33:47.480 --> 3:33:51.480]  Because then you'll never have a chance to really see God get involved in things
[3:33:51.480 --> 3:33:56.480]  God gets involved when you put your skin on the line
[3:33:56.480 --> 3:33:58.480]  Now, I was a little mean to that last caller
[3:33:58.480 --> 3:34:01.480]  But I clicked and he called like a month ago, the same guy
[3:34:01.480 --> 3:34:05.480]  And said the same weird play
[3:34:05.480 --> 3:34:08.480]  And the left never has a legitimate argument
[3:34:08.480 --> 3:34:11.480]  It's always some fallacy based on a fraud
[3:34:11.480 --> 3:34:18.480]  It's never real because being real isn't in them
[3:34:18.480 --> 3:34:22.480]  Anybody that listens to the show knows I've been a big fan of Assange since he showed up
[3:34:22.480 --> 3:34:27.480]  And I've literally busted my ass to try to get him out of jail
[3:34:27.480 --> 3:34:32.480]  And one of the things they put in the internal Google documents that came out last year
[3:34:32.480 --> 3:34:35.480]  That Cernovich got, that Google admitted were real
[3:34:35.480 --> 3:34:38.480]  Was that I was defending Assange
[3:34:38.480 --> 3:34:42.480]  You notice all the media has turned against him
[3:34:42.480 --> 3:34:46.480]  All these people that interviewed him back when they all said he deserves to go to prison
[3:34:46.480 --> 3:34:49.480]  Because they're not journalists, they're pieces of crap
[3:34:49.480 --> 3:34:54.480]  But a lib dart calls in, when I've been persecuted, I'm not a victim
[3:34:54.480 --> 3:34:56.480]  I expect to get attacked
[3:34:56.480 --> 3:34:59.480]  Hell, if my ass is locked up in prison for exposing corruption
[3:34:59.480 --> 3:35:01.480]  I expect people to try to get me out
[3:35:01.480 --> 3:35:06.480]  I mean, to my tail, watching his ass rot in solitary confinement, I feel like it's me
[3:35:06.480 --> 3:35:10.480]  I'm pissed!
[3:35:10.480 --> 3:35:14.480]  And so the guy calls up and says, I'm pissing on Assange?
[3:35:14.480 --> 3:35:16.480]  I wanted to beat Hillary real bad
[3:35:16.480 --> 3:35:19.480]  I knew what she was involved in
[3:35:19.480 --> 3:35:21.480]  They kept saying, oh it's big, it's gonna hurt Hillary
[3:35:21.480 --> 3:35:24.480]  I said then release it
[3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:28.480]  And all he's got is that I was mean to Assange
[3:35:28.480 --> 3:35:31.480]  Well you're a Democrat, God's want him dead
[3:35:31.480 --> 3:35:35.480]  But see, doesn't matter to a lib dart
[3:35:35.480 --> 3:35:37.480]  Because they're cut off from reality
[3:35:37.480 --> 3:35:40.480]  They know we have a conscience, they know we care
[3:35:40.480 --> 3:35:44.480]  They don't, they're sociopaths
[3:35:44.480 --> 3:35:48.480]  All the studies show it
[3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:51.480]  But that's why they come up to us like we're a vending machine and try to program us
[3:35:51.480 --> 3:35:53.480]  You're bad, you're not being loving, you're not
[3:35:53.480 --> 3:35:59.480]  Because they keep trying to like make us fall down and worship them
[3:35:59.480 --> 3:36:04.480]  And it's not working anymore and they don't know what to do
[3:36:04.480 --> 3:36:07.480]  So they all just chip away
[3:36:07.480 --> 3:36:10.480]  That they could be somebody if Trump was removed from office
[3:36:10.480 --> 3:36:13.480]  Let me tell you something, worst thing ever happened to you lib darts
[3:36:13.480 --> 3:36:16.480]  Is that they are able to remove Trump
[3:36:16.480 --> 3:36:22.480]  Ha, I mean that is gonna, that is gonna cook your goose seven ways to Sunday
[3:36:22.480 --> 3:36:26.480]  It's not gonna happen
[3:36:26.480 --> 3:36:28.480]  None of the current trajectory
[3:36:28.480 --> 3:36:33.480]  And you better think you're dirty little stars
[3:36:33.480 --> 3:36:35.480]  Because anybody kills Trump
[3:36:35.480 --> 3:36:37.480]  Or they remove him in some half ass event
[3:36:37.480 --> 3:36:41.480]  It's gonna trigger things that in the end are gonna devastate you
[3:36:41.480 --> 3:36:44.480]  And by the way
[3:36:44.480 --> 3:36:47.480]  If Trump's evil
[3:36:47.480 --> 3:36:49.480]  And he's got a good measure of it
[3:36:49.480 --> 3:36:52.480]  As we all do, but he's got a little gleam going on
[3:36:52.480 --> 3:36:54.480]  A little bit of shine on him
[3:36:54.480 --> 3:36:58.480]  You know what I mean, a little bit of shine on that old skunky guunky
[3:36:58.480 --> 3:37:01.480]  Is that he's manipulating you guys into something
[3:37:01.480 --> 3:37:05.480]  To take full power like Emperor Palpatine dumbasses
[3:37:05.480 --> 3:37:09.480]  So I don't, you know, I always got my eyeball pointed at different things
[3:37:09.480 --> 3:37:17.480]  And I don't trust Trump as far as I can throw him
[3:37:17.480 --> 3:37:24.480]  Because I don't trust myself
[3:37:24.480 --> 3:37:26.480]  Seriously
[3:37:26.480 --> 3:37:28.480]  I don't know what I'll be like when I'm 73 years old
[3:37:28.480 --> 3:37:32.480]  I'm getting meaner, I'm getting crazier
[3:37:32.480 --> 3:37:35.480]  I have to really keep myself under control all the time
[3:37:35.480 --> 3:37:37.480]  I have people messing with me like Trump does
[3:37:37.480 --> 3:37:39.480]  I had all that power
[3:37:39.480 --> 3:37:42.480]  Woo!
[3:37:42.480 --> 3:37:45.480]  So maybe he's right holding back and letting all you rats sit there
[3:37:45.480 --> 3:37:48.480]  And climb all over him and crap all over us
[3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:54.480]  Because you are destroying yourselves in the process
[3:37:54.480 --> 3:38:04.480]  And Trump is the smartest guy in the room, huh?
[3:38:04.480 --> 3:38:06.480]  He's a piece of work, that's for sure
[3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:08.480]  Let's go to your phone calls
[3:38:08.480 --> 3:38:11.480]  All right, Trisha and Virginia here on the air, welcome
[3:38:11.480 --> 3:38:13.480]  Thank you, Alec
[3:38:13.480 --> 3:38:15.480]  I've been a listener for many years
[3:38:15.480 --> 3:38:17.480]  I want to say thank you for your product
[3:38:17.480 --> 3:38:21.480]  I've been slowly putting my family on them for the last several months
[3:38:21.480 --> 3:38:25.480]  Say my son-in-law who is 6'3", well over 300 pounds
[3:38:25.480 --> 3:38:27.480]  Massive bear of a man, he's a big welder
[3:38:27.480 --> 3:38:31.480]  He's so happy with your products, he cannot live without them
[3:38:31.480 --> 3:38:35.480]  He's lost so much weight, he's thrilled
[3:38:35.480 --> 3:38:39.480]  Well that's awesome, what products is he on?
[3:38:39.480 --> 3:38:41.480]  He's on your 8-pack power stack
[3:38:41.480 --> 3:38:45.480]  He's on that powder, that power drink that you have
[3:38:45.480 --> 3:38:47.480]  Turbo force
[3:38:47.480 --> 3:38:49.480]  He's up taking all those monster drinks and all that other stuff
[3:38:49.480 --> 3:38:52.480]  You know, when he goes to work, he just takes that little powder drink with him
[3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:54.480]  And he takes it, he's good all day
[3:38:54.480 --> 3:38:57.480]  The other day, he was out cutting wood on the property
[3:38:57.480 --> 3:38:59.480]  And he came in at like 10 o'clock in the morning
[3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:01.480]  He said to his wife, I forgot to take my power drink
[3:39:01.480 --> 3:39:03.480]  He said, I gotta get this stuff, I'm tired
[3:39:03.480 --> 3:39:06.480]  Because he didn't bring it to work, he wasn't at work
[3:39:06.480 --> 3:39:09.480]  He was out cutting down wood, loves this stuff
[3:39:09.480 --> 3:39:12.480]  My husband, he's got some serious health problems
[3:39:12.480 --> 3:39:16.480]  Started him on it, the turmeric is better than the ibuprofen
[3:39:16.480 --> 3:39:18.480]  This stuff is amazing, amazing stuff
[3:39:18.480 --> 3:39:21.480]  Well that's what turmeric does, you know, when I've got an ache or a pain
[3:39:21.480 --> 3:39:24.480]  It's a food, I'll take like 5 or 6 of them
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:27.480]  And it works way better for me personally than Advil
[3:39:27.480 --> 3:39:30.480]  That's what most people say, I mean, quite frankly I hurt my back 2 weeks ago
[3:39:30.480 --> 3:39:35.480]  Doing 2 heavier squats, because I'm older and I've done heavy squats in a while
[3:39:35.480 --> 3:39:37.480]  So I did a little bit heavier squats and a little bit of my back got hurt
[3:39:37.480 --> 3:39:41.480]  And so I was taking Advil and I'm like, wait a minute, take turmeric too
[3:39:41.480 --> 3:39:43.480]  And the 2 together were amazing for me
[3:39:43.480 --> 3:39:46.480]  But what you said about turbo force is absolutely true
[3:39:46.480 --> 3:39:50.480]  If you look at the big energy drinks, they're full of dyes
[3:39:50.480 --> 3:39:52.480]  They're full of weird chemicals
[3:39:52.480 --> 3:39:55.480]  And then they're full of a bunch of synthetic caffeine and other drugs
[3:39:55.480 --> 3:39:58.480]  And they'll wake your ass up, but at a very big detriment to your body
[3:39:58.480 --> 3:40:03.480]  Not turbo force, it's 5 types of natural energy that are time released
[3:40:03.480 --> 3:40:06.480]  And then it's got the vitamins, the minerals and amino acids
[3:40:06.480 --> 3:40:10.480]  To upload it into your cells and take it across the blood-brain barrier
[3:40:10.480 --> 3:40:13.480]  And so that's why turbo force is so strong
[3:40:13.480 --> 3:40:17.480]  And quite frankly, I can't take it and I can't take brain force plus
[3:40:17.480 --> 3:40:19.480]  Unless it's like 7 at night and I've got to work till 2 a.m.
[3:40:19.480 --> 3:40:22.480]  Then I take it and I'm great and it has a clean come down
[3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:25.480]  So yeah, these are just the cleanest, best formulas you're going to find
[3:40:25.480 --> 3:40:28.480]  They're all 50% off right now and get a free bottle of brain force plus
[3:40:28.480 --> 3:40:31.480]  With DNA force right now as part of the Cyber Monday sales
[3:40:31.480 --> 3:40:34.480]  It'll run through this week and then these huge sales that have been going for so long
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:36.480]  Are going to have to end for a while
[3:40:36.480 --> 3:40:38.480]  I want to thank everybody for their support, it's beyond critical
[3:40:38.480 --> 3:40:41.480]  What is your view on what the country needs to do?
[3:40:41.480 --> 3:40:43.480]  First of all, I want to say that last caller
[3:40:43.480 --> 3:40:46.480]  He's what I call spam, he's what I call static
[3:40:46.480 --> 3:40:50.480]  You need to not put your energy into him, you don't need to put your time into him
[3:40:50.480 --> 3:40:54.480]  You need to focus on solutions and exposing evil
[3:40:54.480 --> 3:40:57.480]  The whole damn country has got to wake up
[3:40:57.480 --> 3:41:00.480]  I came from New England and moved to Virginia 13 years ago
[3:41:00.480 --> 3:41:04.480]  My father said to me many, many, many years ago
[3:41:04.480 --> 3:41:07.480]  That all of New England has turned into a spiritual wasteland
[3:41:07.480 --> 3:41:10.480]  We moved to Virginia and it was like a breath of fresh air
[3:41:10.480 --> 3:41:13.480]  There's one problem, I don't understand it
[3:41:13.480 --> 3:41:17.480]  I don't understand how these people, especially black people
[3:41:17.480 --> 3:41:20.480]  I love black people, they are fantastic people
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:25.480]  But how can they go off of the Democrat plantations from the Civil War
[3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:28.480]  Under these people's belt, under their roof
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:33.480]  Taking their food, taking everything, being told what to do, when to do it, how to do it
[3:41:33.480 --> 3:41:38.480]  Fight for their freedom, not get the right to own firearms until what?
[3:41:38.480 --> 3:41:43.480]  The 70s, when did black people actually get the right to own the firearm in this country?
[3:41:43.480 --> 3:41:48.480]  Fight for civil rights and they're still voting for the Democrat plantation
[3:41:48.480 --> 3:41:51.480]  I don't get it, I'll never understand it
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:56.480]  It's called Stockholm syndrome, people tend to submit to their abusers
[3:41:56.480 --> 3:41:59.480]  If they don't think they can get out of it, people adapt to the slavery
[3:41:59.480 --> 3:42:06.480]  What you said is central, the gun laws were passed in the 60s and 70s in black cities
[3:42:06.480 --> 3:42:11.480]  And so that's where that was done, to make sure black folks couldn't have guns
[3:42:11.480 --> 3:42:15.480]  Then the NRA was set up at the end of the Civil War
[3:42:15.480 --> 3:42:18.480]  Because northerners didn't know how to shoot like southerners
[3:42:18.480 --> 3:42:23.480]  And because the KKK was taking black people's guns when they got them
[3:42:23.480 --> 3:42:29.480]  And so what you said is totally accurate that literally, I mean the Democrats are the KKK
[3:42:29.480 --> 3:42:34.480]  But they've got people on their plantation and all you've ever known is slavery
[3:42:34.480 --> 3:42:37.480]  It's hard to get out of it, but we're all going under the same slavery
[3:42:37.480 --> 3:42:39.480]  God bless you Trish, great points
[3:42:39.480 --> 3:42:42.480]  Alright, more calls, I promise, I'm going to move quick when we come back
[3:42:42.480 --> 3:42:44.480]  Stay with us, this is the final segment
[3:42:44.480 --> 3:42:46.480]  Then the war room with Owen Shroyer is coming up
[3:42:46.480 --> 3:42:48.480]  I might just come over there and co-host that with him
[3:42:53.480 --> 3:42:56.480]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson
[3:42:56.480 --> 3:43:04.480]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[3:43:04.480 --> 3:43:06.480]  How far will they go? What's their limit?
[3:43:06.480 --> 3:43:13.480]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit
[3:43:13.480 --> 3:43:19.480]  The answer is there is no limit to evil, it is a bottomless pit
[3:43:19.480 --> 3:43:24.480]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist
[3:43:24.480 --> 3:43:28.480]  Or that there's no free will, there's no devil or the God
[3:43:28.480 --> 3:43:32.480]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech
[3:43:32.480 --> 3:43:38.480]  And how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like
[3:43:38.480 --> 3:43:42.480]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us
[3:43:42.480 --> 3:43:44.480]  Oxford's banned clapping
[3:43:44.480 --> 3:43:47.480]  University of the US has banned 21 gun salutes for veterans
[3:43:47.480 --> 3:43:51.480]  These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them
[3:43:51.480 --> 3:43:55.480]  Black Friday is here and the sales are so numerous
[3:43:55.480 --> 3:43:57.480]  There is no way to go over all of them

[3:44:48.480 --> 3:44:52.480]  Please take action and fund this operation
[3:44:52.480 --> 3:44:55.480]  Major report out of major university
[3:44:55.480 --> 3:44:59.480]  Researchers working on food based treatment to slow aging science daily
[3:44:59.480 --> 3:45:02.480]  Probiotics in the gut of a particular type
[3:45:02.480 --> 3:45:05.480]  Causer entire body to be healthier and make you live longer
[3:45:05.480 --> 3:45:07.480]  And make you not get intestinal cancer
[3:45:07.480 --> 3:45:09.480]  We have the very best formula, literally
[3:45:09.480 --> 3:45:11.480]  With what they even mentioned in the studies
[3:45:11.480 --> 3:45:15.480]  And it explains the hormone called FGF21
[3:45:15.480 --> 3:45:18.480]  Prolonggevity heals the entire body
[3:45:18.480 --> 3:45:23.480]  And actually reverses aging but is only made in the lower intestine
[3:45:23.480 --> 3:45:24.480]  Oh and what does it say?
[3:45:24.480 --> 3:45:28.480]  It's fiber from a spectrum of certain types of berries
[3:45:28.480 --> 3:45:29.480]  That grows this
[3:45:29.480 --> 3:45:31.480]  And yes, this is a plug, gut fusion
[3:45:31.480 --> 3:45:33.480]  And what do we have in this?
[3:45:33.480 --> 3:45:37.480]  High auric berry blend, strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, cranberry
[3:45:37.480 --> 3:45:41.480]  Escoglio, grape and pomegranate, it's the pulp from them
[3:45:41.480 --> 3:45:43.480]  That then grows this
[3:45:43.480 --> 3:45:46.480]  Gut fusion for children, for young people, for old people, for everybody
[3:45:46.480 --> 3:45:48.480]  This is fiber and glutamine
[3:45:48.480 --> 3:45:50.480]  You're not going to find a better formula
[3:45:50.480 --> 3:45:51.480]  Gut fusion, it's amazing
[3:45:51.480 --> 3:45:54.480]  M4store.com
[3:45:54.480 --> 3:45:57.480]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true
[3:45:57.480 --> 3:45:58.480]  But I'm here to tell you
[3:45:58.480 --> 3:46:03.480]  Most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball
[3:46:03.480 --> 3:46:05.480]  I could see where the globalists were going
[3:46:05.480 --> 3:46:08.480]  I could see what their in-game agenda was
[3:46:08.480 --> 3:46:09.480]  What their goal was
[3:46:09.480 --> 3:46:12.480]  And I knew that when they were setting us up to be deplatformed
[3:46:12.480 --> 3:46:17.480]  That they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air
[3:46:17.480 --> 3:46:24.480]  To silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers
[3:46:24.480 --> 3:46:27.480]  So that their false narratives couldn't be opposed
[3:46:27.480 --> 3:46:33.480]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future
[3:46:33.480 --> 3:46:35.480]  It was the model of info wars
[3:46:35.480 --> 3:46:39.480]  As much as the information that had to be silenced
[3:46:39.480 --> 3:46:43.480]  Because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies
[3:46:43.480 --> 3:46:45.480]  And the evil they're pushing to succeed
[3:46:45.480 --> 3:46:47.480]  And that's why keeping info wars on the air
[3:46:47.480 --> 3:47:03.480]  Is now more imperative and more vital than ever
[3:47:03.480 --> 3:47:17.480]  Only 336 days left and the number one thing we've got to start doing is not submit to the globalist and stand up and be heard
[3:47:17.480 --> 3:47:21.480]  Speak out, stop being the silent majority
[3:47:21.480 --> 3:47:25.480]  Become the active majority we are
[3:47:25.480 --> 3:47:31.480]  Or continue to turn the world and society over to pure bloodthirsty evil
[3:47:31.480 --> 3:47:33.480]  Let's run through these calls as quickly as possible
[3:47:33.480 --> 3:47:36.480]  And then I want Troyer's coming up with the war room
[3:47:36.480 --> 3:47:38.480]  I got a lot I didn't get to
[3:47:38.480 --> 3:47:41.480]  So good chance I'm going to be co-hosting with him
[3:47:41.480 --> 3:47:42.480]  I'm going to get word in a minute
[3:47:42.480 --> 3:47:44.480]  If he already has a guest lined up I won't do that
[3:47:44.480 --> 3:47:48.480]  But I should know here towards the end of this segment
[3:47:48.480 --> 3:47:54.480]  But right now let's go ahead and go to Troyer's retired police officer
[3:47:54.480 --> 3:47:57.480]  I want to talk about United Nations crime, the border and Epstein
[3:47:57.480 --> 3:47:58.480]  Go ahead and thanks for calling
[3:47:58.480 --> 3:48:02.480]  Well be blessed Alex, you, your staff and your family
[3:48:02.480 --> 3:48:09.480]  I pray that the Heavenly Father and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ bless all of you all the time
[3:48:09.480 --> 3:48:12.480]  And thank you for giving us the truth
[3:48:12.480 --> 3:48:15.480]  At least the best you can, the best anyone can
[3:48:15.480 --> 3:48:17.480]  And I just appreciate you, your products
[3:48:17.480 --> 3:48:23.480]  And I'm the first time caller and I've been listening for about, well, right before the election
[3:48:23.480 --> 3:48:25.480]  2016 election I actually got to an Indian
[3:48:25.480 --> 3:48:26.480]  So thank you
[3:48:26.480 --> 3:48:30.480]  Well thank you sir, what do you think about this whole situation?
[3:48:30.480 --> 3:48:36.480]  Based on my experiences it looks like we're all being set up for
[3:48:36.480 --> 3:48:42.480]  If you take China, the UN, the hands that are sort of guiding them
[3:48:42.480 --> 3:48:45.480]  What's going on at the border
[3:48:45.480 --> 3:48:50.480]  What I've dealt with in the city of Redding when I worked there
[3:48:50.480 --> 3:48:57.480]  This is the 90s, we had a huge influx of illegal aliens there
[3:48:57.480 --> 3:49:00.480]  That were primarily criminal running the drug cartel
[3:49:00.480 --> 3:49:05.480]  And it seems like they're just trying to rip the whole country apart
[3:49:05.480 --> 3:49:08.480]  And if you take everything that you took God out of
[3:49:08.480 --> 3:49:10.480]  You take God out of that education
[3:49:10.480 --> 3:49:15.480]  You took God out of the medical, they don't go by the Hippocratic Earth anymore
[3:49:15.480 --> 3:49:18.480]  You took God out of government, this is where we're at
[3:49:18.480 --> 3:49:24.480]  So I think we're getting ready for pretty much a big fight
[3:49:24.480 --> 3:49:28.480]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all
[3:49:28.480 --> 3:49:32.480]  We can simplify it, they admit they don't want this country existing
[3:49:32.480 --> 3:49:38.480]  And the Chai comms are funding the Hollywood poison, all of it, you're absolutely right
[3:49:38.480 --> 3:49:42.480]  And I think it really comes down to what we're going to do to be vocal and active
[3:49:42.480 --> 3:49:43.480]  And what President Trump does
[3:49:43.480 --> 3:49:46.480]  I'm a big supporter of Trump but I'm telling you
[3:49:46.480 --> 3:49:48.480]  He's not letting them ban Republican ads
[3:49:48.480 --> 3:49:51.480]  He's not letting them ban his wife's image on Facebook
[3:49:51.480 --> 3:49:56.480]  I mean, he's really failed the test of allowing this type of un-American censorship of control
[3:49:56.480 --> 3:49:58.480]  It's really incredible
[3:49:58.480 --> 3:50:00.480]  Well, it might be a well-laid trap
[3:50:00.480 --> 3:50:03.480]  If you let it go one far and one direction
[3:50:03.480 --> 3:50:06.480]  Take 9-11, I mean, I got the Patriot Act
[3:50:06.480 --> 3:50:08.480]  And if they set us up for a civil war here
[3:50:08.480 --> 3:50:11.480]  We start begging for all the ID's and the restrictions
[3:50:11.480 --> 3:50:15.480]  And all these electronic surveillance, they're going to get us that way too
[3:50:15.480 --> 3:50:21.480]  So, I mean, as much as sort of like the fluff that you see on the mainstream media
[3:50:21.480 --> 3:50:23.480]  That's more of a distraction
[3:50:23.480 --> 3:50:27.480]  I think the people who are a little more in tune need to realize
[3:50:27.480 --> 3:50:31.480]  And especially the first responders, you know, for those who are listening
[3:50:31.480 --> 3:50:36.480]  I think, I mean, you take the flag for what you do
[3:50:36.480 --> 3:50:37.480]  You're over the target
[3:50:37.480 --> 3:50:40.480]  A lot of first responders, a lot of them are either overwhelmed on the job
[3:50:40.480 --> 3:50:43.480]  Trying to handle badness of their local communities
[3:50:43.480 --> 3:50:46.480]  And this is what we're raising in their own families
[3:50:46.480 --> 3:50:48.480]  Whatever income they make
[3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:52.480]  So it comes to that point where we need to be very careful
[3:50:52.480 --> 3:50:58.480]  I mean, I gave my life up to Jesus Christ now again
[3:50:58.480 --> 3:50:59.480]  I'm very thankful for that
[3:50:59.480 --> 3:51:02.480]  I don't think I'd be here without Him
[3:51:02.480 --> 3:51:04.480]  Based on what I've seen and done
[3:51:04.480 --> 3:51:08.480]  But we need to remind ourselves that as Christians too
[3:51:08.480 --> 3:51:09.480]  No, I totally agree
[3:51:09.480 --> 3:51:10.480]  Please call back, sir
[3:51:10.480 --> 3:51:11.480]  Thank you, great callers today
[3:51:11.480 --> 3:51:13.480]  Trying to get to all these
[3:51:13.480 --> 3:51:15.480]  I may just ultimately blow over for war room as well
[3:51:15.480 --> 3:51:16.480]  So I'm going to get to everybody
[3:51:16.480 --> 3:51:18.480]  Yeah, get your relationship right with God, folks
[3:51:18.480 --> 3:51:19.480]  That's the bottom line
[3:51:19.480 --> 3:51:21.480]  This is totally spiritual, it's real
[3:51:21.480 --> 3:51:22.480]  And thank God, we know it's all real
[3:51:22.480 --> 3:51:24.480]  So thank God for Jesus
[3:51:24.480 --> 3:51:26.480]  I mean, it just comes down to that
[3:51:26.480 --> 3:51:31.480]  Let's go to George in Connecticut
[3:51:31.480 --> 3:51:33.480]  He says, guerrilla activism
[3:51:33.480 --> 3:51:36.480]  I agree, if we hit the streets, we're smart
[3:51:36.480 --> 3:51:37.480]  We've got ways to get the word out
[3:51:37.480 --> 3:51:39.480]  What should the guerrilla activism be?
[3:51:39.480 --> 3:51:41.480]  What should our slogans be, George?
[3:51:41.480 --> 3:51:43.480]  Well, it's not the slogans
[3:51:43.480 --> 3:51:45.480]  It's more or less how we should attack them
[3:51:45.480 --> 3:51:48.480]  We should use the old-time faxes to the White House
[3:51:48.480 --> 3:51:50.480]  To our representatives
[3:51:50.480 --> 3:51:52.480]  Because we bury them in faxes on an issue
[3:51:52.480 --> 3:51:54.480]  They don't want to acknowledge
[3:51:54.480 --> 3:51:57.480]  They can't just hit delete for a thousand emails
[3:51:57.480 --> 3:52:00.480]  Or whatever, or voicemails
[3:52:00.480 --> 3:52:02.480]  The same thing, we should use postcards
[3:52:02.480 --> 3:52:06.480]  To the White House on free assange, free Roger Stone
[3:52:06.480 --> 3:52:08.480]  Or whatever issue it is
[3:52:08.480 --> 3:52:10.480]  We send millions of these things
[3:52:10.480 --> 3:52:12.480]  The people that are surrounding Trump
[3:52:12.480 --> 3:52:14.480]  And trying to keep these electronic means
[3:52:14.480 --> 3:52:16.480]  From getting to them
[3:52:16.480 --> 3:52:18.480]  It's going to be hard to see piles of mail
[3:52:18.480 --> 3:52:20.480]  With the cards that are open there
[3:52:20.480 --> 3:52:22.480]  And so you can see exactly what's on the message
[3:52:22.480 --> 3:52:24.480]  That somebody in the White House
[3:52:24.480 --> 3:52:26.480]  Won't dump a couple of cards
[3:52:26.480 --> 3:52:28.480]  And Trump goes and gets into the mail
[3:52:28.480 --> 3:52:30.480]  In fact, they hate that
[3:52:30.480 --> 3:52:32.480]  People should be writing postcards
[3:52:32.480 --> 3:52:34.480]  Every day to the White House
[3:52:34.480 --> 3:52:35.480]  Until the election
[3:52:35.480 --> 3:52:36.480]  I totally agree
[3:52:36.480 --> 3:52:38.480]  And tomorrow I'll go with your messages
[3:52:38.480 --> 3:52:39.480]  To the White House, yes
[3:52:39.480 --> 3:52:41.480]  It absolutely gets into there
[3:52:41.480 --> 3:52:43.480]  Hammer them with everything you've got
[3:52:43.480 --> 3:52:45.480]  And everybody should go buy a bullhorn
[3:52:45.480 --> 3:52:47.480]  And go bullhorn the White House
[3:52:47.480 --> 3:52:48.480]  Trump can hear it
[3:52:48.480 --> 3:52:50.480]  You're only like a hundred yards away
[3:52:50.480 --> 3:52:51.480]  Believe me, it was on national news
[3:52:51.480 --> 3:52:52.480]  When I went and bullhorned
[3:52:52.480 --> 3:52:54.480]  You could hear it in the White House
[3:52:54.480 --> 3:52:56.480]  Also, each one of these
[3:52:56.480 --> 3:52:58.480]  Demonstration that he has
[3:52:58.480 --> 3:53:00.480]  He sets up for these rallies
[3:53:00.480 --> 3:53:02.480]  We should be outside and saying
[3:53:02.480 --> 3:53:04.480]  Free assange
[3:53:04.480 --> 3:53:06.480]  Stop the censorship
[3:53:06.480 --> 3:53:07.480]  Bullhorn that
[3:53:07.480 --> 3:53:10.480]  And also emphasize
[3:53:10.480 --> 3:53:12.480]  Postcards and out of these rallies
[3:53:12.480 --> 3:53:14.480]  That we should be basically
[3:53:14.480 --> 3:53:16.480]  Yanking the licenses of the major
[3:53:16.480 --> 3:53:18.480]  Networks since they're not showing
[3:53:18.480 --> 3:53:20.480]  A true independence
[3:53:20.480 --> 3:53:22.480]  They're showing bias against the president
[3:53:22.480 --> 3:53:24.480]  And also anything that is
[3:53:24.480 --> 3:53:26.480]  A way left of center
[3:53:26.480 --> 3:53:28.480]  And as well on the corporate
[3:53:28.480 --> 3:53:30.480]  Level as far as these big corporations
[3:53:30.480 --> 3:53:32.480]  Whether it's a Facebook or whatever
[3:53:32.480 --> 3:53:34.480]  We should be
[3:53:34.480 --> 3:53:36.480]  Yank their
[3:53:36.480 --> 3:53:38.480]  The limited partnerships and their corporate
[3:53:38.480 --> 3:53:40.480]  Things and their licenses
[3:53:40.480 --> 3:53:42.480]  On the grounds that they're racketeering
[3:53:42.480 --> 3:53:44.480]  I totally agree, George
[3:53:44.480 --> 3:53:46.480]  God bless you, incredible points
[3:53:46.480 --> 3:53:48.480]  By the way, I've just got to say this
[3:53:48.480 --> 3:53:50.480]  What the globalists are doing is really
[3:53:50.480 --> 3:53:52.480]  Illegal and crazy and over the top
[3:53:52.480 --> 3:53:54.480]  If we just call it, they're going to get defeated
[3:53:54.480 --> 3:53:56.480]  This fake impeachment is driving
[3:53:56.480 --> 3:53:58.480]  Trump's numbers up
[3:53:58.480 --> 3:54:00.480]  Again
[3:54:00.480 --> 3:54:02.480]  As long as we stay engaged, we're going to win
[3:54:02.480 --> 3:54:04.480]  Now I'm going to keep taking calls
[3:54:04.480 --> 3:54:06.480]  But this phone system works in the other studios
[3:54:06.480 --> 3:54:08.480]  So I promise you, I'm going over there with Owen
[3:54:08.480 --> 3:54:10.480]  Because Owen got back with me, he doesn't want me to host
[3:54:10.480 --> 3:54:12.480]  At least the first hour with him
[3:54:12.480 --> 3:54:14.480]  I'm going to get rid of the calls right up front
[3:54:14.480 --> 3:54:16.480]  Boom, we're going to get to you
[3:54:16.480 --> 3:54:18.480]  You're not going to hold anymore
[3:54:18.480 --> 3:54:20.480]  I'm going to take these calls and hell of Owen once
[3:54:20.480 --> 3:54:22.480]  I'll just host the whole thing where they're going to take calls
[3:54:22.480 --> 3:54:24.480]  Because I'm just going to fight hard and I've got a bunch of stuff planned
[3:54:24.480 --> 3:54:26.480]  And I'm just going to give you my full commitment here
[3:54:26.480 --> 3:54:28.480]  And so we're going to get to Nick and Pastor Sam
[3:54:28.480 --> 3:54:30.480]  And Matt and Bob
[3:54:30.480 --> 3:54:32.480]  Transfer those over
[3:54:32.480 --> 3:54:34.480]  And at five after
[3:54:34.480 --> 3:54:36.480]  First thing we're doing on the war room
[3:54:36.480 --> 3:54:38.480]  In FullWars.com for its last show, Bandai Video
[3:54:38.480 --> 3:54:40.480]  It's on the radio and TV satellites
[3:54:40.480 --> 3:54:42.480]  A lot of our stations pick them up
[3:54:42.480 --> 3:54:44.480]  Keep spreading the word, folks
[3:54:44.480 --> 3:54:46.480]  Because here's an example, they took us off all these platforms that we were number one on
[3:54:46.480 --> 3:54:48.480]  We went to number one
[3:54:48.480 --> 3:54:50.480]  On cloud TV after being on there three months
[3:54:50.480 --> 3:54:52.480]  That reaches millions of people
[3:54:52.480 --> 3:54:54.480]  That's got hundreds of channels
[3:54:54.480 --> 3:54:56.480]  That's bigger than Fox News
[3:54:56.480 --> 3:54:58.480]  That's bigger than
[3:54:58.480 --> 3:55:00.480]  OAN
[3:55:00.480 --> 3:55:02.480]  That's bigger than
[3:55:02.480 --> 3:55:04.480]  Newsmax, by the way
[3:55:04.480 --> 3:55:06.480]  I'm not in competition with them
[3:55:06.480 --> 3:55:08.480]  I'm glad they're out there
[3:55:08.480 --> 3:55:10.480]  It's just that people know the real thing
[3:55:10.480 --> 3:55:12.480]  They know this isn't scripted
[3:55:12.480 --> 3:55:14.480]  They know we mean business here
[3:55:14.480 --> 3:55:16.480]  And God bless you
[3:55:16.480 --> 3:55:18.480]  You're doing it, folks
[3:55:18.480 --> 3:55:20.480]  That's why they don't want us to be anywhere
[3:55:20.480 --> 3:55:22.480]  Because we go to the top
[3:55:22.480 --> 3:55:24.480]  Showing America wants the truth
[3:55:24.480 --> 3:55:26.480]  America wants freedom
[3:55:26.480 --> 3:55:28.480]  America and the world understand what's happening
[3:55:28.480 --> 3:55:30.480]  That's why they've got to target the children
[3:55:30.480 --> 3:55:32.480]  Before they know any better
[3:55:32.480 --> 3:55:34.480]  But the children innately know what's happening
[3:55:34.480 --> 3:55:36.480]  So just, I cannot stress enough
[3:55:36.480 --> 3:55:38.480]  That the world's on fire right now
[3:55:38.480 --> 3:55:40.480]  For evil and for good
[3:55:40.480 --> 3:55:42.480]  The quickening's here
[3:55:42.480 --> 3:55:44.480]  The battle is now, and I will get to the chipping of the Austin Homeless
[3:55:44.480 --> 3:55:46.480]  It's all confirmed, and I'm so mad at myself
[3:55:46.480 --> 3:55:48.480]  That I knew this a month ago, barely covered it
[3:55:48.480 --> 3:55:50.480]  And then now there's a viral video of the Homeless talking about how they're getting chips
[3:55:50.480 --> 3:55:52.480]  And where they're being moved into
[3:55:52.480 --> 3:55:54.480]  No, they're telling the truth, because they've got the documents
[3:55:54.480 --> 3:55:56.480]  But it's just, that's crazy
[3:55:56.480 --> 3:55:58.480]  And then I didn't get into the head of YouTube just telling huge lies
[3:55:58.480 --> 3:56:00.480]  On 60 Minutes
[3:56:00.480 --> 3:56:02.480]  We'll get to that, too
[3:56:02.480 --> 3:56:04.480]  War Room, Owen Schreuer
[3:56:04.480 --> 3:56:06.480]  Weekdays, 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
[3:56:06.480 --> 3:56:08.480]  There's an hour of my show rebroadcast
[3:56:08.480 --> 3:56:10.480]  And then we've got Firepower with Will Johnson
[3:56:10.480 --> 3:56:12.480]  And Tom Papert, and that's, of course
[3:56:12.480 --> 3:56:14.480]  Weeknights, 7 to 9, and we'll add more shows
[3:56:14.480 --> 3:56:16.480]  As soon as we can get more crew and build things up
[3:56:16.480 --> 3:56:18.480]  But that comes down to your funding
[3:56:18.480 --> 3:56:20.480]  So thank you all for the funding
[3:56:20.480 --> 3:56:22.480]  And thank you to MNFM Station
[3:56:22.480 --> 3:56:24.480]  Support cable systems that pick us up
[3:56:24.480 --> 3:56:26.480]  Let them know you support, become a sponsor, whatever
[3:56:26.480 --> 3:56:28.480]  And buy the products at M4store.com
[3:56:28.480 --> 3:56:30.480]  You need the turmeric
[3:56:30.480 --> 3:56:32.480]  You need the fish oil
[3:56:32.480 --> 3:56:34.480]  You need the high quality, hyaluronic acid skin cream
[3:56:34.480 --> 3:56:36.480]  And the big tubes, that's now back at stock
[3:56:36.480 --> 3:56:38.480]  That was sold out for months
[3:56:38.480 --> 3:56:40.480]  We've got a bunch of stuff
[3:56:40.480 --> 3:56:42.480]  We got triple Patriot points, 50% off
[3:56:42.480 --> 3:56:44.480]  Free shipping, a lot of these things are lost
[3:56:44.480 --> 3:56:46.480]  Leaders at that price, but we've got to sell everything
[3:56:46.480 --> 3:56:48.480]  Just to fund ourselves in the next year
[3:56:48.480 --> 3:56:50.480]  For your support, but quite frankly
[3:56:50.480 --> 3:56:52.480]  It is neck and neck for this operation
[3:56:52.480 --> 3:56:54.480]  And so you've seen my commitment
[3:56:54.480 --> 3:56:56.480]  You've seen me turn up the heat
[3:56:56.480 --> 3:56:58.480]  You've seen me fight even harder
[3:56:58.480 --> 3:57:00.480]  Because this is just making or breaking
[3:57:00.480 --> 3:57:02.480]  And we are winning
[3:57:02.480 --> 3:57:04.480]  Make no mistake, our energy level
[3:57:04.480 --> 3:57:06.480]  Our spirit is completely different than this world
[3:57:06.480 --> 3:57:08.480]  We all know that, we understand it
[3:57:08.480 --> 3:57:10.480]  And we see these zombie slaves
[3:57:10.480 --> 3:57:12.480]  We wonder why they don't love God
[3:57:12.480 --> 3:57:14.480]  It's because they've cut off from God
[3:57:14.480 --> 3:57:16.480]  For whatever reason, they never got the spark
[3:57:16.480 --> 3:57:18.480]  And we found God
[3:57:18.480 --> 3:57:20.480]  Thank God for sending his son in here
[3:57:20.480 --> 3:57:22.480]  Special operations right down in here
[3:57:22.480 --> 3:57:24.480]  To get tortured and have everything put on him
[3:57:24.480 --> 3:57:26.480]  Because that's the fair thing to do, ladies and gentlemen
[3:57:26.480 --> 3:57:28.480]  And God did it
[3:57:28.480 --> 3:57:30.480]  Went through all of that for us
[3:57:30.480 --> 3:57:32.480]  So that we can beat this thing with his help
[3:57:32.480 --> 3:57:34.480]  So it's all coming up right now
[3:57:34.480 --> 3:57:36.480]  In just two minutes that kick off live
[3:57:36.480 --> 3:57:38.480]  Spread those leaks, the war room
[3:57:38.480 --> 3:57:48.480]  Your calls and more right now
