[00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:10.032]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.032 --> 00:00:11.613]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.613 --> 00:00:12.534]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:17.358]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.358 --> 00:00:21.422]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:43.833]  Well, we have a very informative and riveting broadcast lined up for you today on this 8th day of January 2009, this Thursday edition.
[00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:58.718]  Steve Quayle joins us in 30 minutes for an hour to talk about the economy, what's happening in Israel, and what the big surprise is coming up on January 21st from Barack H. Obama.
[00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:02.243]  That and a host of other important issues.
[00:01:02.243 --> 00:01:08.987]  Then, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us to go over the Gaza situation from his perspective, also the economy.
[00:01:08.987 --> 00:01:13.709]  He's the former head of policy at the Treasury and the father of Reaganomics.
[00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:19.012]  And then, for an hour and a half today, we are joined by David Icke.
[00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:23.594]  And we could have him for two hours, but I have a little surprise in that last 20-30 minutes.
[00:01:25.415 --> 00:01:37.519]  of the show that for the viewers out there on PrisonPlanet.TV when we simulcast the last two hours and of course for the radio listeners.
[00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:42.261]  But Steve Quayle, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and David Icke on January 8, 2009.
[00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:44.641]  So that is coming up today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:52.338]  Well, it wasn't hard to predict it.
[00:01:52.338 --> 00:02:01.440]  The police have basically decided not to charge the individual who cold-bloodedly shot a poor black man in the back.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.761]  The bullet then bounced off the concrete.
[00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:06.821]  He was spread-eagle with an officer sitting on his head.
[00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:16.283]  The bullet went through his back into the concrete, bounced back up in a mushroom formation, and ricocheted through his lungs.
[00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:18.704]  He died about an hour later at the hospital.
[00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:22.269]  And I'd seen two different videos.
[00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.653]  First, the police said that...
[00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:33.875]  There were no videos, and it turned out they'd confiscated videos and claimed that the videos were not working there at the DART station.
[00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:40.357]  They confiscated citizens, now known as civilian slaves cameras, but it turned out two people had gotten video.
[00:02:40.357 --> 00:02:51.621]  Now another video has surfaced that police weren't able to confiscate, and now I've seen more of this officer's body language up close, and he looks like he's completely out of his mind.
[00:02:52.541 --> 00:03:03.691]  He's resigned from the force, and now the police are saying, well we're no longer involved in this because he's resigned, so now it's not our issue, and now Eternal Affairs isn't investigating.
[00:03:03.691 --> 00:03:05.813]  What does that mean?
[00:03:05.813 --> 00:03:14.461]  So if a cop murders somebody, either capital murder, premeditated, or whether it's manslaughter,
[00:03:15.543 --> 00:03:20.788]  Whether it's accidental, and I think clearly it's pointing towards capital murder now, this guy's a lunatic.
[00:03:20.788 --> 00:03:26.233]  I mean, I can see him getting off on an insanity plea, maybe.
[00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:38.906]  Because you watch him, he pulls the gun out, he sights it, and you know the difference between a black, what looks like a Glock or Heckler & Koch, you know, classic, standard issue,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.302]  Handgun, looks like 9mm .40 cal, something along those lines.
[00:03:44.302 --> 00:03:45.042]  We don't know yet.
[00:03:45.042 --> 00:03:46.983]  They've kept that secret.
[00:03:46.983 --> 00:03:52.206]  And he sights it, holds the shot for about two seconds, and shoots the guy in the back.
[00:03:52.206 --> 00:03:54.607]  Now, I'd said maybe it was taser confusion.
[00:03:54.607 --> 00:04:02.211]  But now, watching him from a closer video angle, off somebody's cell phone camera, he looks like a vampiric demon or something.
[00:04:02.211 --> 00:04:04.672]  He looks like Bela Lugosi.
[00:04:04.672 --> 00:04:06.273]  His eyes are completely crazed.
[00:04:06.273 --> 00:04:07.274]  He looks like a lunatic!
[00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:11.126]  And I'm not trying to get the guy off.
[00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:19.733]  I mean, I was saying, could be taser confusion, but still, why would they pull a taser when the guy's spread eagle on the ground with cops sitting on his head?
[00:04:20.523 --> 00:04:22.164]  When he didn't resist.
[00:04:22.164 --> 00:04:24.846]  Why did they lie and say there weren't videotapes?
[00:04:24.846 --> 00:04:25.967]  Or recordings?
[00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:28.929]  Why did they lie and say there was a scuffle going on?
[00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:32.011]  The media shows the video and says, you can see a scuffle.
[00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:32.671]  There's no scuffle.
[00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:34.252]  The guy's laying there.
[00:04:34.252 --> 00:04:37.154]  One cop jumps on his head so he flinches.
[00:04:37.154 --> 00:04:39.035]  You see him in pain.
[00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:39.896]  Slightly flinch.
[00:04:39.896 --> 00:04:42.258]  I guess his hands move off the ground about two inches.
[00:04:42.258 --> 00:04:44.039]  And I guess that's a death penalty.
[00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.282]  Hey, when we jump on your head with our knees, when we jump on your neck, if you flinch,
[00:04:48.982 --> 00:04:50.303]  And the poor guy's begging.
[00:04:50.303 --> 00:04:52.123]  He's saying, please, I got a four-year-old daughter.
[00:04:52.123 --> 00:04:56.886]  Please don't tase me, because witnesses said the cop was threatening to tase him.
[00:04:56.886 --> 00:04:58.286]  They just murdered him.
[00:04:58.286 --> 00:05:01.287]  Now there's been riots in San Francisco.
[00:05:01.287 --> 00:05:01.908]  Hello, friends.
[00:05:01.908 --> 00:05:02.968]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:07.710]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.692]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:05:10.692 --> 00:05:13.713]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:18.435]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:05:18.675 --> 00:05:19.856]  If you simply prepare.
[00:05:19.856 --> 00:05:23.600]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.641]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:27.483]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[00:05:27.483 --> 00:05:31.447]  They voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air.
[00:05:31.447 --> 00:05:33.889]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:43.400]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.488]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days, until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[00:05:50.488 --> 00:05:52.511]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:54.932]  There seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[00:05:54.932 --> 00:06:00.635]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[00:06:00.635 --> 00:06:03.876]  The stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business.
[00:06:03.876 --> 00:06:07.238]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[00:06:07.238 --> 00:06:09.058]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[00:06:09.058 --> 00:06:13.120]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.561]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared.
[00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:16.562]  Get self-sufficient.
[00:06:16.562 --> 00:06:16.982]  Get food.
[00:06:17.242 --> 00:06:24.786]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[00:06:24.786 --> 00:06:28.728]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[00:06:28.728 --> 00:06:31.950]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:38.954]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:06:38.954 --> 00:06:42.036]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:06:42.216 --> 00:06:47.380]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:53.625]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, freeze-dried and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:57.388]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:57.388 --> 00:06:58.669]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:58.669 --> 00:06:59.370]  Take action today.
[00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.211]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:07:09.935 --> 00:07:18.661]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:18.661 --> 00:07:22.944]  Protest over bark shooting turned violent, San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:07:22.944 --> 00:07:24.085]  I watched video of it.
[00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:38.790]  When police started getting in people's faces and telling them to disperse, that they were not an authorized, permitted crowd, they began throwing soda bottles and things at the police car windows.
[00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.713]  They overturned police cars, burned police cars.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.462]  The police began firing rubber bullets at the crowd.
[00:07:45.462 --> 00:07:48.245]  And you know why the people are doing this?
[00:07:48.245 --> 00:07:57.214]  They don't like seeing a fellow human being murdered execution style and then the system making excuses for it if you want any respect from the public.
[00:07:58.447 --> 00:08:08.875]  You have to punish your officers when they murder people in cold blood, but no, you've been caught lying, which is par for the course.
[00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:25.126]  We had a former top Texas police narcotics officer in here yesterday talking about how 85% of the narcotics officers he knew, including himself, planted drugs on people in their cars, in their homes, they used informants to do it, and he's now running stings across the country.
[00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:32.468]  And he's set to have a national TV show, by the way, showing all of this happening and going on.
[00:08:32.468 --> 00:08:37.649]  Incidentally, we're going to give him a radio show here on Genesis in the next two weeks, regardless, out of my studios.
[00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:42.170]  But he's already done one on XM.
[00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:43.391]  But I was guessing 60%.
[00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:44.831]  You know, I didn't say that on air.
[00:08:44.831 --> 00:08:49.472]  I said, when we come back, we'll find out what percentage, on average, of narcotics officers plant drugs.
[00:08:50.612 --> 00:08:52.053]  And I was going to say 60%.
[00:08:52.053 --> 00:08:53.333]  He said, no, about 85%.
[00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:56.555]  And I've interviewed famous New York detectives.
[00:08:56.555 --> 00:09:07.821]  The one guy who, what, Swartz was his name, who, several of them, but back in the 70s, over 70% of the detectives in narcotics got fired in New York City.
[00:09:07.821 --> 00:09:10.282]  It turned out they were dealing drugs.
[00:09:10.282 --> 00:09:12.443]  But I was trying to give the police the benefit of the doubt and saying 60%.
[00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:16.894]  Plant drugs, and he said, no, it's more like 85%.
[00:09:16.894 --> 00:09:22.216]  Now let's be clear, that's narcotics officers and narcotics task forces.
[00:09:22.216 --> 00:09:34.759]  Your average beat cops, from my studies, it's very rare for the traffic officer to, or bike cops, to be out planting drugs.
[00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:39.181]  Very common for the FBI, very common for narcotics officers.
[00:09:40.182 --> 00:09:43.544]  And this goes to the heart of our judicial system.
[00:09:43.544 --> 00:09:53.332]  They've now done DNA tests nationwide and on average over 30% or right at about a third of death row inmates are completely innocent.
[00:09:53.332 --> 00:10:05.661]  In fact, many times people on their deathbeds confess that they really committed murders and then they go DNA test the person that confesses they did it and it turns out it was their DNA and not the person sitting on death row.
[00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:09.970]  I've always been for the death penalty.
[00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:17.156]  I mean, I believe if somebody kidnaps a child, rapes them, and kills them, and you've got incontrovertible evidence, execute them.
[00:10:17.156 --> 00:10:22.320]  But I do believe that it's better that ten guilty men go free than one innocent man fry.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.286]  The police have the attitude, though, that, oh, I'm sure you did something wrong.
[00:10:28.286 --> 00:10:35.272]  I'll never forget, when I was a teenager in Dallas, other than getting in a lot of fistfights, I was very clean.
[00:10:36.954 --> 00:10:38.054]  Again, didn't like drugs.
[00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:41.196]  I tried a few every time I hated them.
[00:10:41.196 --> 00:10:42.676]  I liked alcohol.
[00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:44.077]  When we could get our hands on it.
[00:10:44.077 --> 00:10:45.658]  But that was it!
[00:10:45.658 --> 00:10:55.402]  And they would just call kids in all day long to the office, not just myself, and say, we know you're a drug dealer, we know you're stealing stereos, and you're going to work for us now.
[00:10:55.402 --> 00:10:57.623]  And I said no, and then they got very upset.
[00:10:57.623 --> 00:10:59.684]  But I mean, this is just standard.
[00:10:59.684 --> 00:11:04.386]  And I'll never forget the cops saying, well, if you didn't steal those stereos, I know you're doing something illegal.
[00:11:05.134 --> 00:11:11.797]  And I was self-righteous and said, yeah, I've stolen beer out of the golf carts.
[00:11:11.797 --> 00:11:19.861]  That's how teenagers got their beer in Rockwall, Texas, is there were golf courses all over the community in different neighborhoods.
[00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:29.506]  And before I even had a car or a motorcycle or a moped, we would walk sometimes a couple miles over to our buddies' houses.
[00:11:29.506 --> 00:11:34.369]  And I only stole beer a couple times, but I had buddies who did it all the time.
[00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:39.844]  To the point of not leaving their ice chest in the back of their golf carts.
[00:11:39.844 --> 00:11:45.386]  And they'd all be in the different golf... I'm already digressing with this story.
[00:11:45.386 --> 00:11:49.567]  The point is that I've said, yeah, I've stolen beer.
[00:11:49.567 --> 00:11:51.228]  We know you've done a lot more than that.
[00:11:51.228 --> 00:11:54.049]  This was years after I'd stolen beer out of an ice chest.
[00:11:55.875 --> 00:12:08.162]  Can you imagine being 13, 14 years old and you run up, grab a six-pack, a bottle of wine out of the back of the ice chest, run off in the woods and drink it with your buddies and roll around in the leaves?
[00:12:08.162 --> 00:12:09.382]  That's about the extent of it.
[00:12:09.382 --> 00:12:11.664]  Oh, and there was a convertible.
[00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:23.010]  We could go to one Easy Mart, but we had to walk about two miles because the other convenience stores on the main highway by our neighborhood wouldn't sell youth cigarettes, but the Easy Mart would.
[00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.851]  But I did one time, there was a convertible.
[00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.798]  Open with a pack of Marlboro Reds laying on the dash.
[00:12:30.798 --> 00:12:35.407]  Let's just have a little confession hour here and I grabbed that pack of cigarettes and I smoked them.
[00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:37.355]  But that's it.
[00:12:37.355 --> 00:12:41.038]  That's the extent of my great thievery.
[00:12:41.038 --> 00:12:42.579]  Meanwhile, we're criminals.
[00:12:42.579 --> 00:12:45.100]  The entire population are criminals and we deserve it.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.063]  We deserve to be shot in the back because assuredly we did something wrong in our lives.
[00:12:49.063 --> 00:12:52.605]  We deserve to be framed for a murder because assuredly we did something wrong in our lives.
[00:12:52.605 --> 00:13:01.570]  But then the police just run around framing whoever they want, stealing houses, stealing homes.
[00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:02.691]  And that's okay.
[00:13:02.691 --> 00:13:04.012]  That's a wonderful thing.
[00:13:06.508 --> 00:13:12.131]  Coming up later, I'm going to play a clip from San Francisco News dealing with the crowds.
[00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:18.515]  It's also posted up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now as the public fights back.
[00:13:18.515 --> 00:13:33.764]  And if these riots were to continue, the police would just dress up like protesters and then attack old ladies on video camera and then say the public was attacking old ladies as a false flag to demonize the protesters as they just got caught doing in Greece, as they just got caught doing in Denver,
[00:13:34.804 --> 00:13:35.384]  It's admitted.
[00:13:35.384 --> 00:13:36.145]  Police admit it.
[00:13:36.145 --> 00:13:38.206]  Caught in Denver.
[00:13:38.206 --> 00:13:43.748]  As they got caught in Canada, as they got caught in Seattle, I mean, we're constantly catching them.
[00:13:43.748 --> 00:13:45.269]  I'll say Austin police aren't as bad.
[00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:51.212]  They were just calling for violence and trying to shove a few people when we had the Fortune 500 back in, what, 1998 in Austin, Texas.
[00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:58.669]  And I got in their facial cameras and said, you're police?
[00:13:58.669 --> 00:14:01.212]  And then a bunch of cops ran across the street and said, back off, Jones.
[00:14:01.212 --> 00:14:04.695]  And then they inserted two more cops, but they stopped stirring up trouble.
[00:14:04.695 --> 00:14:06.757]  Because they had riot cops across the street.
[00:14:06.757 --> 00:14:15.305]  We were about to march from the Capitol to the Fortune 500 at the Four Seasons Hotel on the River, eight blocks away, and they wanted to rubber bullet us.
[00:14:15.305 --> 00:14:21.210]  They wanted to go into that crowd of 400 protesters, maybe 500, and they wanted to bust some heads.
[00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.492]  To then get more riot funding, more police hired.
[00:14:26.492 --> 00:14:39.199]  But it didn't work because I know a 6 foot 5, 280 pound cop isn't a little methamphetamine, 17 year old anarchist.
[00:14:39.199 --> 00:14:40.419]  That's a tip to the police.
[00:14:40.419 --> 00:14:42.580]  You really, you're trying to infiltrate.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.802]  It's pretty obvious when you put your biggest guys in there.
[00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:48.143]  Biggest quote, you know, they can handle it if things get rough.
[00:14:48.143 --> 00:14:50.784]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:14:50.784 --> 00:14:51.725]  How obvious?
[00:14:55.899 --> 00:15:00.862]  Okay.
[00:15:00.862 --> 00:15:06.145]  Here on the show, throughout the broadcast, so we'll be going into more detail on all of these, U.S.
[00:15:06.145 --> 00:15:11.868]  companies faced $409 billion pension deficit study shows out of Reuters.
[00:15:11.868 --> 00:15:17.310]  Now, folks, if you think there's a $409 billion pension deficit, you've got another thing coming.
[00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.833]  They admit losses to 401Ks, which are private pensions, individual pensions,
[00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:25.728]  is several trillion dollars.
[00:15:25.728 --> 00:15:27.969]  That money's been stolen, and you're not getting it back.
[00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:31.650]  What you're getting is a machine gun in your face, unless you stand up.
[00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:34.890]  Now, they're claiming with companies, $409 billion in the U.S.
[00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.631]  alone is bye-bye.
[00:15:36.631 --> 00:15:40.571]  But this is with almost zero transparency from these companies.
[00:15:40.571 --> 00:15:48.713]  See, the owners of these companies, they've already got offshore, armored, protected, Caribbean island facilities.
[00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:56.235]  They've all moved out of the country, so that's where your pension fund money is, in case you were wondering.
[00:15:56.235 --> 00:16:00.739]  We're left behind with all the shaved head, roid heads with machine guns ruling us.
[00:16:00.739 --> 00:16:05.984]  Volatile, of course their pension funds are going to be gone too, but they like the system, it's alright.
[00:16:05.984 --> 00:16:11.489]  They like to plant drugs on us and rob us and abuse us, well they get robbed by the bigger crooks, that's how it works.
[00:16:11.489 --> 00:16:14.811]  You like corruption, you think it's cute, well get ready for the society to totally fall.
[00:16:15.768 --> 00:16:17.889]  Volatile markets have saddened U.S.
[00:16:17.889 --> 00:16:26.172]  companies with a $409 billion deficit on pension funds, reversing a $60 billion surplus a year earlier.
[00:16:26.172 --> 00:16:32.755]  So that's $469 billion actually lost then.
[00:16:32.755 --> 00:16:38.417]  As of December 31st, pension funds plans among members of the Standard & Poor's 1500
[00:16:40.563 --> 00:16:45.648]  Had 1.21 trillion of assets and 1.62 trillion of liabilities.
[00:16:45.648 --> 00:16:55.317]  Mercer said in a report released on Wednesday at the end of 2007, pension plan assets totaled 1.66 trillion and liabilities totaled 1.6 trillion, Mercer said.
[00:16:55.317 --> 00:16:57.519]  So, did you hear that?
[00:16:57.519 --> 00:17:04.146]  Liabilities are 1.6 trillion and total assets are 1.66 trillion.
[00:17:06.997 --> 00:17:12.500]  That means there is six billion dollars left.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.760]  See, that should be the headline.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:20.403]  Six billion dollars left in pensions from 1.66 Trill!
[00:17:20.403 --> 00:17:24.525]  There's six billion left!
[00:17:24.525 --> 00:17:26.626]  Oh my gosh!
[00:17:26.626 --> 00:17:29.428]  Hey, you know how you fix it?
[00:17:29.428 --> 00:17:31.749]  You just build more FEMA camps and hire more cops.
[00:17:31.749 --> 00:17:32.749]  That'll save us.
[00:17:32.749 --> 00:17:35.891]  Obama warns of dire consequences without stimulus.
[00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.052]  And now, as I told you, first they said it was $700 billion, then $800 billion.
[00:17:40.052 --> 00:17:51.560]  Now the new stimulus package, which will be given to select crony corporations, is over $1 trillion, and that's here in the report out of AP Yahoo News.
[00:17:52.779 --> 00:18:02.642]  President-elect Barack Obama said Thursday the recession could linger for years, I mean depression, unless Congress pumps unprecedented sums from Washington to the economy.
[00:18:02.642 --> 00:18:04.482]  He means into his friends' pockets.
[00:18:04.482 --> 00:18:06.963]  This is Chicago-level big machine taking over.
[00:18:06.963 --> 00:18:13.065]  And the highest profile case yet of an issue certain to define and dominate his early presidency.
[00:18:13.065 --> 00:18:15.465]  Now, here's the problem with that.
[00:18:15.465 --> 00:18:16.186]  The world is
[00:18:17.839 --> 00:18:19.840]  Moving away from buying U.S.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.160]  debt, International Herald Tribune today, U.S.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.941]  debt is losing its appeal in China, the biggest owner of U.S.
[00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:28.462]  debt.
[00:18:28.462 --> 00:18:38.945]  China has bought more than $1 trillion in American debt, but as the global downturn has intensified, Beijing is starting to keep more of its money at home and shifting that could pose some challenges to U.S.
[00:18:38.945 --> 00:18:43.986]  government in the near future, eventually may even produce salutary effects on the world economy.
[00:18:45.643 --> 00:18:50.426]  And meanwhile, many other nations are completely moving out of the dollar and out of U.S.
[00:18:50.426 --> 00:19:00.111]  debt, so they are going to give you a depression with hyperinflation from over-issuance of currency on top of it.
[00:19:00.111 --> 00:19:01.832]  But don't worry.
[00:19:01.832 --> 00:19:05.634]  If you complain, they'll lay you out on the concrete and pump a couple rounds right through you.
[00:19:05.634 --> 00:19:06.475]  How's that sound?
[00:19:10.003 --> 00:19:11.804]  The headlines are clear.
[00:19:11.804 --> 00:19:14.726]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[00:19:14.726 --> 00:19:17.949]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:19.690]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.992]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[00:19:22.992 --> 00:19:25.754]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.
[00:19:25.754 --> 00:19:26.634]  To stay free.
[00:19:27.655 --> 00:19:31.318]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.

[00:20:05.698 --> 00:20:09.620]  A long-term food solution.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.140]  Good day.
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.881]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:20:11.881 --> 00:20:13.802]  January 8th, 2009.
[00:20:13.802 --> 00:20:14.782]  Gold opened this morning at $855.50.
[00:20:14.782 --> 00:20:20.184]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $880.77, $440.39 for the half ounce, and $220.19 for a quarter ounce.
[00:20:20.184 --> 00:20:20.585]  That's $880.77, $440.39, and $220.19.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:33.205]  70% of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[00:20:33.205 --> 00:20:36.669]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:37.590]  Bad news for U.S.
[00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:38.230]  currency.
[00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.373]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[00:20:40.373 --> 00:20:41.954]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[00:20:41.954 --> 00:20:44.036]  Dollars fall into 65% of euro.
[00:20:44.036 --> 00:20:45.198]  Erosion accelerates.
[00:20:45.198 --> 00:20:47.720]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of the U.S.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.462]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[00:20:49.662 --> 00:20:54.603]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:54.603 --> 00:20:56.043]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:19.023 --> 00:21:20.383]  Who is the enemy?
[00:21:20.383 --> 00:21:21.184]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:21.184 --> 00:21:22.164]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:22.164 --> 00:21:23.524]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:23.524 --> 00:21:25.525]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:25.525 --> 00:21:32.687]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:32.687 --> 00:21:33.167]  Some U.S.
[00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:38.809]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:39.509 --> 00:21:42.991]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:42.991 --> 00:21:45.171]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:22:09.258 --> 00:22:11.779]  What will you do when the economy collapses?
[00:22:11.779 --> 00:22:14.760]  Store shelves are empty and your stored food is gone.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.581]  How will you feed your family?

[00:23:36.758 --> 00:23:39.600]  Babies dying.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.543]  Mothers crying.
[00:23:42.543 --> 00:23:47.847]  How much all is one human life worth.
[00:23:47.847 --> 00:23:53.771]  What happened to peace on earth?
[00:23:53.771 --> 00:23:58.394]  We believe everything that they tell us.
[00:23:58.394 --> 00:24:00.036]  They're gonna kill us.
[00:24:00.036 --> 00:24:01.437]  We better kill them first.
[00:24:04.022 --> 00:24:13.207]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:13.207 --> 00:24:17.529]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:24:17.529 --> 00:24:20.190]  Okay, continuing to the news here.
[00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:26.073]  Headline, Obama AP will spend our way out of this.
[00:24:28.126 --> 00:24:32.029]  Again, at the end, they are taking 8.5 trillion we know of.
[00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:34.471]  It's been over three weeks since we got a new number.
[00:24:34.471 --> 00:24:39.474]  Outside the U.S., over 10 trillion from Japan to Germany to France to England to the Netherlands.
[00:24:39.474 --> 00:24:42.616]  That's how much or more they've sucked out of other people's coffers.
[00:24:42.616 --> 00:24:45.819]  And remember, we have to pay all this back in taxes.
[00:24:45.819 --> 00:24:48.681]  They keep telling us it's to save the economy, but it isn't.
[00:24:49.261 --> 00:25:05.804]  It's going offshore and the governments of the world are now fully controlled by these offshore banks and they have ordered their puppet governments to even pass laws to give it the illusion of legality that no one can even review or find out where the money is going.
[00:25:07.438 --> 00:25:09.619]  And the looting, the raping has only begun.
[00:25:09.619 --> 00:25:14.323]  Now they're saying, we'll spend our way out of this as trillions a week are sucked into the private banks.
[00:25:14.323 --> 00:25:21.047]  And now they're saying a trillion or more, quote, domestically, but that will only be given to select global corporations as well.
[00:25:21.047 --> 00:25:24.289]  We have the laundry list of where it's going.
[00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:29.132]  And any of the money that actually goes to the citizens will be to give you, quote, little federal jobs.
[00:25:29.132 --> 00:25:31.734]  And these aren't jobs building dams or roads.
[00:25:31.734 --> 00:25:34.296]  That'd be okay if we're going to be socialist.
[00:25:35.316 --> 00:25:40.758]  I'm against the socialism to begin with, but no, it's youth brigades and tattletale squads and domestic drafts.
[00:25:40.758 --> 00:25:50.621]  And the public is still in denial with Rahm Emanuel and the incoming White House and Obama all on record saying, yes, you're going to have to serve!
[00:25:50.621 --> 00:26:00.263]  And we post CNN clips, C-Span clips, ABC clips with Emanuel saying it, with Obama saying it, people comment under it saying, we posted fake video.
[00:26:00.263 --> 00:26:03.905]  These Obamanoids just don't understand.
[00:26:03.905 --> 00:26:04.905]  It's really happening.
[00:26:06.525 --> 00:26:11.707]  Israel fires on Lebanon in response to rocket attack, and they're now saying it may open up into a second front.
[00:26:11.707 --> 00:26:13.008]  We'll get more into that.
[00:26:13.008 --> 00:26:17.429]  Sarkozy and Merkel and Blair call for new capitalism.
[00:26:17.429 --> 00:26:24.192]  The head of the European's biggest economy said Tuesday that world leaders should be looking at the massive U.S.
[00:26:24.192 --> 00:26:29.494]  deficit and other economic imbalances, not just problems caused by financial markets, as they debate a new global order.
[00:26:29.494 --> 00:26:31.975]  And they go on to say America's time is over.
[00:26:33.277 --> 00:26:36.020]  The new center of the world order will be Europe.
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.401]  Well, that's who owned us to begin with.
[00:26:37.401 --> 00:26:49.554]  Again, they've run up our credit card, they're trashing us, they're bringing us down, they're announcing we're dead, so they can be the new center of the world system, which was always the plan back to the trilateralists back in 1974.
[00:26:49.554 --> 00:26:53.097]  That's how we've been predicting for years exactly what would happen, because they told us.
[00:26:53.097 --> 00:26:56.481]  It isn't predicting, it's like reading a TV guide and saying what's coming on TV tonight.
[00:26:58.376 --> 00:27:03.237]  Just as Obama begins, huge deficits could hamper his plans to save us.
[00:27:03.237 --> 00:27:04.917]  Oh, it's not his fault.
[00:27:04.917 --> 00:27:07.378]  Here's one on global warming.
[00:27:07.378 --> 00:27:08.838]  How's this for odd?
[00:27:08.838 --> 00:27:12.899]  Minnesota sleigh dog race cancelled because of too much snow.
[00:27:12.899 --> 00:27:17.120]  Coldest winter in decades worldwide.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:27.502]  And now, Russia, because of Ukraine threatening to renege on their lease of a naval port and moving weapons systems up against the border,
[00:27:28.502 --> 00:27:35.568]  Russia cut back on some of the basically free gas they've been giving them as a subsidy as part of that deal, and so what did Ukraine do?
[00:27:35.568 --> 00:27:37.369]  They just cut off gas to Europe.
[00:27:37.369 --> 00:27:39.611]  People could die there, folks.
[00:27:39.611 --> 00:27:42.294]  I mean, below zero in many of those countries.
[00:27:42.294 --> 00:27:45.176]  In fact, people are dying, the press is reporting.
[00:27:45.176 --> 00:27:51.982]  You know, I saw a blurb about this in email, and I didn't believe it, and I googled it, and it was our very own KVUE Austin TV.
[00:27:51.982 --> 00:27:54.244]  New law restricts resale of kids' products.
[00:27:55.131 --> 00:28:03.953]  And it's saying that the way the federal law is written, you can't sell used clothes for children or shoes or anything else on eBay.
[00:28:03.953 --> 00:28:06.114]  That's my wife's favorite place to buy my children clothes.
[00:28:06.114 --> 00:28:09.715]  She loves buying vintage stuff on there.
[00:28:09.715 --> 00:28:12.396]  And that little resale shops won't be able to sell.
[00:28:12.396 --> 00:28:13.876]  It's got an Austin business.
[00:28:13.876 --> 00:28:18.878]  It's going to have to close its doors.
[00:28:18.878 --> 00:28:20.618]  This is absolutely amazing.
[00:28:20.618 --> 00:28:23.759]  And see, they're shutting down all our basic
[00:28:25.083 --> 00:28:26.845]  Underground market.
[00:28:26.845 --> 00:28:32.769]  That's why they're now raiding with police watermelon stands and farms selling organic chicken eggs.
[00:28:32.769 --> 00:28:34.791]  It's what Stalin did.
[00:28:34.791 --> 00:28:37.113]  So, new law restricts resale of kids products.
[00:28:37.113 --> 00:28:39.095]  You can't make this up.
[00:28:39.095 --> 00:28:42.377]  That is just some of what we've got here.
[00:28:42.377 --> 00:28:45.380]  Oh, remember I told you the Trans-Texas Corridor wasn't dead?
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:50.965]  Unbelievably, the statesman got it right with a headline, Trans-Texas Corridor dead in name only.
[00:28:52.395 --> 00:28:53.636]  So, they got it right.
[00:28:53.636 --> 00:28:55.577]  I want to salute Ben Weir.
[00:28:55.577 --> 00:28:56.778]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:56.778 --> 00:28:59.840]  Stay with us.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.241]  We're on the march.
[00:29:01.241 --> 00:29:03.783]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:03.783 --> 00:29:09.887]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:32:32.897 --> 00:32:35.360]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[00:32:37.515 --> 00:32:41.879]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:41.879 --> 00:32:48.886]  We're going to Steve Quayle, veteran broadcaster, best-selling author, frequent coast-to-coast contributor.
[00:33:03.819 --> 00:33:11.783]  And somebody I learned a lot from 15 years ago when I really started waking up right before I got on air.
[00:33:11.783 --> 00:33:14.444]  Before I do that, I wanted to hit this news.
[00:33:14.444 --> 00:33:22.487]  On InfoWars.com, we posted a link to this story and the disinfo trolls went in and said, look at Alex, he's a liar.
[00:33:22.487 --> 00:33:27.289]  He said they'd already built the Trans-Texas Corridor, but now they're saying it's cancelled.
[00:33:27.289 --> 00:33:28.190]  It's gotta be disinfo.
[00:33:29.045 --> 00:33:34.332]  You know, first, the mainstream media said the Trans-Texas Corridor, the North American Napa Superhighway didn't exist.
[00:33:34.332 --> 00:33:36.875]  We got all the documents.
[00:33:36.875 --> 00:33:42.803]  Two years ago, the legislature said, okay, we're passing a law against these toll roads, these takeover by foreign companies.
[00:33:42.803 --> 00:33:44.765]  The governor vetoed it and still enforced it.
[00:33:45.706 --> 00:33:55.372]  Then, two days ago, TechStop put out a press release saying it is dead, but then under it it said, but we're going to do the entire project in different sections, just under a new name.
[00:33:55.372 --> 00:34:02.616]  I mean, it was in the article, and people emailed and the media attacked me and said that it didn't say that.
[00:34:02.616 --> 00:34:06.958]  Then, their other deceptive spin is to claim, well, Alex, I thought they'd built it.
[00:34:06.958 --> 00:34:08.919]  Yes, they're building large sections of it.
[00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:35.410]  just uh... east of austin all around austin we've got giant transit score billboards up everywhere they're putting toll roads on existing roads they put what six of them up the last two years in austin swearing they wouldn't i mean they're there they're real i've gone out and videotaped them i put the film in game but still the public's under mind control and so the establishment say no it doesn't exist as he first they said it didn't exist now
[00:34:36.551 --> 00:34:51.074]  They are saying they've cancelled it, which is a lie itself, and the statesman of all places, a day after I made the point that it was dead in name only, Trans-Texas Corridor, name dies, but not entire concept.
[00:34:51.074 --> 00:34:59.095]  And it goes on to say, plans of cross-state tollways, railways, and utility lines, officials say, will be done in pieces.
[00:34:59.095 --> 00:35:01.515]  It's the same thing, they're just changing the name.
[00:35:01.515 --> 00:35:04.136]  And this has been, we're Austin American Statesman, there you go.
[00:35:05.157 --> 00:35:12.162]  And then a day after I make the point that it's a fraud, we post the article and the disinfo trolls come in.
[00:35:12.162 --> 00:35:14.464]  And again, it isn't that they're hurting me.
[00:35:14.464 --> 00:35:19.708]  It's that I'm illustrating how deceptive they are and there's no way these are just the general public.
[00:35:19.708 --> 00:35:28.394]  The Pentagon, private corporations, they admit that they have all these paid trolls on the web trying to counter us.
[00:35:28.394 --> 00:35:30.556]  Another issue, and then we're going to Steve Quayle, is this.
[00:35:32.065 --> 00:35:38.832]  We moved to the new office completely about two and a half weeks ago, and I had this bullhorn that I used in the movie A Scanner Darkly.
[00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:45.093]  I guess I've had it five, six years since the last one got broke, got broken.
[00:35:45.093 --> 00:35:51.640]  And it's the favorite model, this big Radio Shack model that I found is the loudest for the size.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.982]  And it's been in just countless demonstrations.
[00:35:53.982 --> 00:35:55.243]  The last one was in Denver.
[00:35:55.243 --> 00:35:59.287]  We were bullhorning MSNBC for covering up that 9-11 was an inside job outside.
[00:35:59.287 --> 00:36:00.949]  And they came over, grabbed it, tried to rip it away.
[00:36:00.949 --> 00:36:02.671]  Then a guy comes up with a knife and cuts it.
[00:36:02.671 --> 00:36:03.312]  It's on video.
[00:36:05.274 --> 00:36:10.876]  And so if somebody wants to buy the bullhorn, we have an eBay auction going.
[00:36:10.876 --> 00:36:15.797]  They can fix that or they can keep it as a classic piece of Liberty memorabilia.
[00:36:15.797 --> 00:36:24.280]  And the Disinfo Trolls went into the article on InfoWars.com that Curt Nemo posted, Alex Jones' Tyranny Crusher 1 bullhorn auctioned at eBay.
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:38.288]  And they yelled and screamed and said, how dare you be selling this, how dare you be profiting, how dare you be doing this, when we've stated that we're selling the bullhorn to raise money to expand the studio.
[00:36:38.288 --> 00:36:42.971]  We've built the new radio studio, you've seen it, it looks great, if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer.
[00:36:44.281 --> 00:36:51.247]  We're building the new studio, but in this economy we don't have the funds to do this if people don't support us.
[00:36:51.247 --> 00:36:56.091]  But think about what a mind game, and this came out in the 70s in the COINTELPRO documents.
[00:36:56.091 --> 00:37:06.080]  It just came out last year in a declassified 2004 Army manual on COINTELPRO and nations they're taking down, to always talk about your opposition and say they're trying to make money.
[00:37:07.618 --> 00:37:11.242]  Now think of what a mind trick this is.
[00:37:11.242 --> 00:37:13.906]  Think of what a mind game this is.
[00:37:16.243 --> 00:37:21.987]  The government can have offshore banks take it over and still 8.5 trillion and growing.
[00:37:21.987 --> 00:37:36.016]  They can erect hundreds of new taxes, 88 new ones in New York State alone, carbon taxes, taxes on cows, flatulence, total control of society, regulate everything you do, income taxes, state income taxes, franchise taxes, sales taxes.
[00:37:36.016 --> 00:37:43.941]  They take your money and use it against you, and then they claim that alternative media isn't allowed to capitalize their operations.
[00:37:43.941 --> 00:37:45.703]  That is, get the money to expand.
[00:37:46.343 --> 00:37:59.009]  They are so afraid and trying this asinine tactic against us that it's bad that we have good microphones and good cameras and make good films and have big powerful websites and reach tens of millions of people.
[00:37:59.009 --> 00:38:06.372]  They are so afraid of that and just think of the ridiculous mind game they play.
[00:38:06.372 --> 00:38:08.773]  So that's what it is.
[00:38:08.773 --> 00:38:13.055]  The auction is going to be going until next Wednesday night at about 1130 in the evening.
[00:38:14.804 --> 00:38:15.924]  And then it closes out.
[00:38:15.924 --> 00:38:19.826]  It's $1,500, which is a drop in the bucket when you're buying equipment.
[00:38:19.826 --> 00:38:25.028]  And I'm glad to say it's above $2,500 now with the last time I checked, 16 bids.
[00:38:25.028 --> 00:38:28.009]  Let me just click on it and find out what it is now.
[00:38:28.009 --> 00:38:30.430]  And I hope $50,000 gets raised for the Bullhorn.
[00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:32.791]  It isn't the point that the Bullhorn's even worth that.
[00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:38.233]  It's that it is a way to donate and have some fun donating and fund this operation.
[00:38:38.233 --> 00:38:42.615]  And so, in the spirit of fighting back against tyranny,
[00:38:44.582 --> 00:38:45.343]  I want everybody.
[00:38:45.343 --> 00:38:46.143]  I'm not ashamed.
[00:38:46.143 --> 00:38:49.746]  I'm proud of the fact we're expanding and fighting the New World Order.
[00:38:49.746 --> 00:38:53.268]  Even though our capital level has been shrinking somewhat because of the economy.
[00:38:53.268 --> 00:38:56.651]  We need you to go to InfoWars.com and buy books and videos.
[00:38:56.651 --> 00:39:05.757]  Not just because they're the best books and videos out there, the library we carry, but because it supports what we're doing here in this highly effective message.
[00:39:05.757 --> 00:39:10.160]  And so this psychological warfare tactic of saying we should be ashamed of
[00:39:11.295 --> 00:39:15.461]  Rising and of being successful and of challenging the globalists.
[00:39:15.461 --> 00:39:25.155]  We're supposed to live under a bridge and talk to people through a cardboard box as a bullhorn and just be a bunch of failures while the enemy has unlimited funding against us.
[00:39:26.104 --> 00:39:32.694]  We're already like David against a 10,000 foot Goliath and we're 5 feet tall here, but they don't even like that.
[00:39:32.694 --> 00:39:35.879]  So again, you want to counter the New World Order, don't just support Alex Jones.
[00:39:35.879 --> 00:39:38.903]  Support all the other alternative media.
[00:39:38.903 --> 00:39:41.647]  And if it isn't financial, spread the word about the websites.
[00:39:42.895 --> 00:39:48.561]  God forbid you write InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com on your fellow reserve notes, the way a lot of people are waking up.
[00:39:48.561 --> 00:39:52.264]  God forbid you call into talk shows and talk about the show on mainline radio.
[00:39:52.264 --> 00:39:57.590]  Heaven forbid you tell your email list to tune in via the web at InfoWars.com or go to SteveQuell.com.
[00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:04.056]  So again, people tell me, jump on me about selling things, I'm just going to start pushing it even more.
[00:40:04.056 --> 00:40:06.198]  I'm going to start trying to, I'm going to have another money bond.
[00:40:06.198 --> 00:40:06.819]  How do you like that?
[00:40:08.171 --> 00:40:17.417]  We need it, we're going to do it coming up in the next few months, because we want to be positioned to where we're able to continue, even into a hardcore depression, operating and getting the truth out.
[00:40:17.417 --> 00:40:21.500]  Alright, that said, I appreciate Steve Quayle holding while I went through that.
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:27.184]  Please go to InfoWars.com, buy the books and videos, see that as a donation, that way you even get materials to wake others up.
[00:40:27.184 --> 00:40:29.645]  You can make copies of all my films, get them out to people.
[00:40:29.645 --> 00:40:33.148]  PrisonPlanet.tv memberships, that supports us to operate.
[00:40:33.148 --> 00:40:34.229]  You want to send us a donation?
[00:40:35.029 --> 00:40:38.410]  Cash, money, orders, checks, whatever.
[00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:38.970]  Send them.
[00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:45.692]  Write it to Alex Jones, 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:40:45.692 --> 00:40:50.014]  You know, I don't usually ask for money, but you're going to criticize me for trying to sell something to buy equipment?
[00:40:50.014 --> 00:40:50.794]  Well, that's it.
[00:40:50.794 --> 00:40:54.155]  I'm not ashamed of raising money to fight tyranny.
[00:40:54.155 --> 00:40:54.955]  I'm proud of it.
[00:40:54.955 --> 00:40:59.657]  And your propaganda and your mind control doesn't work on me and it doesn't work on the people anymore.
[00:41:02.594 --> 00:41:06.535]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, our local AM and FM affiliates.
[00:41:06.535 --> 00:41:07.475]  It's a donation.
[00:41:07.475 --> 00:41:10.056]  Call and buy advertising for your business on them.
[00:41:10.056 --> 00:41:11.617]  Thank them for carrying the show.
[00:41:11.617 --> 00:41:14.178]  Don't just help me, help our affiliates.
[00:41:14.178 --> 00:41:16.558]  Support our sponsors.
[00:41:16.558 --> 00:41:17.919]  And buy the books and videos.
[00:41:17.919 --> 00:41:19.439]  I want you to send a strong message.
[00:41:19.439 --> 00:41:31.143]  I want to come on the air tomorrow and say, folks, we sold five times as many books and videos as we normally do per day because, you know, this is a message to the New World Order that we are going to capitalize these operations.
[00:41:31.143 --> 00:41:32.083]  We're going to fund them.
[00:41:34.707 --> 00:41:35.488]  That's what we need.
[00:41:35.488 --> 00:41:36.689]  All right, enough said.
[00:41:36.689 --> 00:41:39.451]  Steve Quayle, I really appreciate you coming on, my friend.
[00:41:39.451 --> 00:41:40.232]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:41:40.232 --> 00:41:41.172]  I've got to tell you something.
[00:41:41.172 --> 00:41:42.954]  Your subject matter is so important.
[00:41:42.954 --> 00:41:45.336]  I'm going to key off the word mind control.
[00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:54.143]  A little over a week ago, someone who works deep in the heart of the underground world of psychological operations for NORTHCOM, I ran into him on the street.
[00:41:54.878 --> 00:41:55.359]  I think so.
[00:42:10.154 --> 00:42:26.044]  When you tell people that the government loads up boards, whether it's a blog against you, a blog against me, the different message boards out there that are always accusing me or accusing you of trying to get rich at these people's expense, I tell them to go and drop dead.
[00:42:26.044 --> 00:42:28.426]  I'm sorry, I'm a little bit more blunt than you are.
[00:42:28.426 --> 00:42:32.789]  But what he told me, Alex, is that they are absolutely in control.
[00:42:33.345 --> 00:42:34.066]  I don't know.
[00:42:47.682 --> 00:42:53.148]  Where the blazes were these people when you know what you've spent over the years and what's been spent on your radio program.
[00:42:53.148 --> 00:43:00.135]  I don't, well I mean, it's targeting the general public that doesn't know what it's like to have, you know, what you do, 10, 20, 30 employees.
[00:43:00.135 --> 00:43:02.037]  What I have, 16, 17 employees.
[00:43:02.037 --> 00:43:09.024]  They have no idea that I wish I didn't have to spend my time grubbing for the money to fight the new world order because that'd be more effective.
[00:43:09.665 --> 00:43:12.107]  I mean, this takes time, this takes energy.
[00:43:12.107 --> 00:43:14.308]  We're on shortwave nine hours a day.
[00:43:14.308 --> 00:43:21.233]  I mean, one of these half-decent prosumer cameras, not even professional cameras, is $6,000.
[00:43:21.233 --> 00:43:23.415]  I mean, we need the funds.
[00:43:23.415 --> 00:43:24.056]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:43:24.056 --> 00:43:26.998]  But let me get to this, because I think this is incredible.
[00:43:26.998 --> 00:43:34.243]  He told me the amount of money they're spending, the Defense Department is spending, to fund new game development in the virtual world.
[00:43:34.741 --> 00:43:36.522]  This is something I don't think people understand.
[00:43:36.522 --> 00:43:41.425]  How many young people are involved in virtual games, virtual identities, Half-Life?
[00:43:41.425 --> 00:43:43.267]  You know, I don't even play these things.
[00:44:05.101 --> 00:44:09.884]  He shows up in a sports car that's a spacecraft.
[00:44:09.884 --> 00:44:10.545]  Yeah, perfect.
[00:44:10.545 --> 00:44:11.866]  But that's exactly what they're doing.
[00:44:11.866 --> 00:44:13.507]  But we're not saying aliens are going on.
[00:44:13.507 --> 00:44:28.456]  That was Hollywood telling you the military developed these to actually find the best players and now they admit it that these are real drone attack simulators and they're going to hire the teenagers to remote pilot the predators.
[00:44:28.456 --> 00:44:28.957]  Absolutely.
[00:44:28.957 --> 00:44:32.599]  When you can set someone to a virtual world, you can divorce them from the real world.
[00:44:33.038 --> 00:44:41.462]  By entangling everybody in what I would call the mind-controlled psychological operations virtual world, you keep them from the true information, Alex.
[00:44:41.462 --> 00:44:45.885]  And mixing false reality with real reality until nobody can tell the difference.
[00:44:45.885 --> 00:44:46.705]  But here's the deal.
[00:44:46.705 --> 00:44:47.866]  I want everyone to understand.
[00:44:47.866 --> 00:44:51.968]  You've been spending a lot of time and effort over the years talking about martial law.
[00:44:51.968 --> 00:44:54.949]  So have I. We've been getting all of the hits we've taken.
[00:44:54.949 --> 00:44:58.691]  I don't care about the hits I'm taking, but here's what people better understand.
[00:44:58.691 --> 00:45:01.953]  On October 7th, we were within two and a half minutes
[00:45:02.486 --> 00:45:04.567]  of going into full-scale martial law.
[00:45:04.567 --> 00:45:09.049]  The command and control general that was up as a five-star general, okay?
[00:45:09.049 --> 00:45:13.891]  That whole guy was, he's known on the radio, I know who it is, but it's Lighthouse.
[00:45:13.891 --> 00:45:19.733]  When I talked to the gentleman who works deep underground, I asked him, I said to him, who is Lighthouse?
[00:45:19.733 --> 00:45:23.755]  He said, that is the command and control authority for martial law.
[00:45:23.755 --> 00:45:25.535]  I said, how close were we to martial law?
[00:45:25.535 --> 00:45:27.056]  I didn't volunteer the information.
[00:45:27.529 --> 00:45:30.470]  He said two and a half minutes is where the countdown... Let me stop you.
[00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:31.070]  Let me stop you.
[00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:33.630]  This is not just Steve Quayle's opinion.
[00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:41.172]  Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma is on record on the news saying they were threatened with martial law October 3rd if they didn't pass the banker takeover.
[00:45:41.172 --> 00:45:43.752]  That was the receivership of the nation by the foreign banks.
[00:45:43.752 --> 00:45:51.254]  We've had two other congressmen on, House members, to tell you they were threatened with martial law and now Bloomberg and AP reported three weeks ago.
[00:45:51.254 --> 00:45:54.714]  Headline, War Powers Act enacted by Federal Reserve.
[00:45:54.714 --> 00:45:57.075]  The Federal Reserve is now above even the executive.
[00:45:57.688 --> 00:46:11.333]  Absolutely, and what people have got to understand, Alex, is they have, and I'm saying this, as they take in every breath they breathe, I want them to start making a conscious effort to realize that there are people that absolutely cannot wait.
[00:46:11.333 --> 00:46:20.277]  This gentleman that told me, high-ranking military officer, said, Steve, he said the plans for martial law are so off the charts and so horrible.
[00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:22.718]  Now, understand, we're not talking about foreign invasion.
[00:46:23.211 --> 00:46:29.277]  He said, I'm having really severe problems, and he asked me quite candidly to keep him in prayer.
[00:46:29.277 --> 00:46:37.845]  But look, Alex, this is someone that I believe, look, you know how many calls you get, you know the different people that you can count on, you can test the veracity of their information.
[00:46:37.845 --> 00:46:38.986]  How many witnesses?
[00:46:38.986 --> 00:46:42.850]  The Bible says about the two or three witnesses, let every be established, let every word be established.
[00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:47.815]  We get two or three thousand witnesses, and you and I are supposedly making this stuff up so we can sell our books.
[00:46:48.373 --> 00:46:53.897]  Well, Steve, Steve, I hope we sell our books to warn people so we can expand and fight this thing.
[00:46:53.897 --> 00:46:55.077]  Again, that's the mind game.
[00:46:55.077 --> 00:46:57.299]  But the point is, what is our message?
[00:46:57.299 --> 00:46:58.400]  What is the information?
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.161]  That's what's key.
[00:47:00.161 --> 00:47:02.462]  I wish our books were selling as much as Harry Potter.
[00:47:02.462 --> 00:47:03.543]  We'd have this thing turned around.
[00:47:03.543 --> 00:47:06.085]  But let me just finish making this point and backing you up.
[00:47:08.706 --> 00:47:10.167]  They are on record.
[00:47:10.167 --> 00:47:11.828]  How many years?
[00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:13.348]  You've been on the air 16, 17 years.
[00:47:13.348 --> 00:47:16.850]  Did you say there were quiet preparations for martial law and give the evidence?
[00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:18.551]  Now it's all declassified.
[00:47:18.551 --> 00:47:20.412]  Now they admit they're going to use foreign troops.
[00:47:20.412 --> 00:47:22.493]  Now it's in major publications.
[00:47:22.493 --> 00:47:24.054]  Now they're admitting troops on the streets.
[00:47:24.054 --> 00:47:26.455]  Marines running checkpoints.
[00:47:26.455 --> 00:47:27.816]  This is really happening.
[00:47:27.816 --> 00:47:29.157]  So the point is, it all happened.
[00:47:30.962 --> 00:47:35.105]  Absolutely, and not only is it happening, see, it's not enough.
[00:47:35.105 --> 00:47:37.006]  Alex, people have got to understand this.
[00:47:37.006 --> 00:47:44.411]  I've got to tell this because this is really the thing that's burning in my heart, is you've got to turn off the television, the literal, physical television.
[00:47:44.781 --> 00:47:58.588]  And you've got to start doing your due diligence and not just listening to Alex Jones or Steve Quayle or Hawk or whoever's out there warning, signing, you know, basically signing our lives, saying, look, this is really happening.
[00:47:58.588 --> 00:48:01.089]  We're not just telling you this for whatever reasons.
[00:48:01.089 --> 00:48:04.891]  By the way, I make no apologies, you know, about having to do what I've got to do.
[00:48:04.891 --> 00:48:12.295]  You asked me earlier, before I went on the air, I came back on my Monday show because I had turned my show over to five different guest hosts.
[00:48:12.805 --> 00:48:21.190]  As trying to turn it over so that, you know, I could give people the best, I guess you'd say, overview of everything going on from five different minds instead of mine, okay?
[00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:34.838]  Well, I'm back on Monday because, again, I've spent 15 years of my life, close to a half a million bucks, out of my pocket to put, you know, the best program I can do, you know, to complement all the other programs out there.
[00:48:34.838 --> 00:48:40.682]  And quite candidly, as you know, it's tough to get people that will carry your passion, carry your zeal, and carry the warning.
[00:48:41.132 --> 00:48:41.433]  I don't
[00:48:56.314 --> 00:48:59.816]  Because there may come a time very soon when we're all off the air and unable to do this.
[00:48:59.816 --> 00:49:11.681]  We have to prepare as if that's not going to happen, but also prepare for it to happen so that we continue to expand, fight the New World Order, but also make the personal preparations, all of us, to go into the next phase.
[00:49:11.681 --> 00:49:13.382]  I mean, Steve, what did you think of the last month?
[00:49:13.922 --> 00:49:29.291]  When hundreds and hundreds of publications, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times of London, AP, came out and said, okay, there's a world government, it's for your own good, we kept it secret from you, but now it's going to be a world government run by private central banks, and you'll pay carbon taxes for all your activities to us.
[00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:33.233]  I mean, that is what we always told people exactly being announced.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.503]  Right, and I think some of the people, I'm going to be very kinder and gentler, Steve.
[00:49:37.503 --> 00:49:44.787]  I think people better get over their poultry dropping, take another word for poultry drop, attitude towards what we're telling them.
[00:49:44.787 --> 00:49:46.589]  Because Alex, they're in our face.
[00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:47.629]  They don't care anymore.
[00:49:47.629 --> 00:49:48.810]  See, that's what people don't understand.
[00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:49.270]  They don't care.
[00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:50.291]  They don't want to hide it.
[00:49:50.291 --> 00:49:51.072]  It's in our face.
[00:49:51.072 --> 00:49:51.672]  They're going to do it.
[00:49:51.672 --> 00:49:59.097]  But the worst thing is, is if people don't recognize it and start making moves to protect their families, they're going to get steamrolled by this thing.
[00:50:00.137 --> 00:50:02.821]  Steve Quayle, let's break down from your Pentagon sources.
[00:50:02.821 --> 00:50:07.827]  You're right out there by Northcom.
[00:50:07.827 --> 00:50:08.768]  Where all this is going?
[00:50:09.679 --> 00:50:14.600]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:22.041]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:50:22.041 --> 00:50:23.642]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:50:23.642 --> 00:50:27.803]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:50:27.803 --> 00:50:31.643]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:50:31.643 --> 00:50:36.124]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:50:36.124 --> 00:50:39.545]  Phase One is a One World Currency, which we are currently being prepared
[00:50:39.565 --> 00:50:39.765]  We're good.
[00:51:09.775 --> 00:51:16.539]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:16.539 --> 00:51:19.180]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:20.741]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:20.741 --> 00:51:21.521]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:21.521 --> 00:51:22.482]  This is his ammo.
[00:51:22.482 --> 00:51:23.903]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:23.903 --> 00:51:25.904]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:51:25.904 --> 00:51:33.048]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:33.528]  Some U.S.
[00:51:33.528 --> 00:51:39.151]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:51:39.851 --> 00:51:43.372]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:51:43.372 --> 00:51:46.173]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:09.995 --> 00:52:11.977]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:52:11.977 --> 00:52:18.944]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:52:18.944 --> 00:52:27.351]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:52:27.351 --> 00:52:33.077]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:52:33.237 --> 00:52:35.078]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:52:35.078 --> 00:52:37.259]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:52:37.259 --> 00:52:41.781]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:52:41.781 --> 00:52:44.022]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:52:44.022 --> 00:52:51.786]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:52:51.946 --> 00:52:52.306]  I don't know.
[00:53:27.479 --> 00:53:33.262]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, father of ergonomics, former head of the treasury, will be joining us coming up in about 45 minutes.
[00:53:33.262 --> 00:53:36.504]  Then we got David Icke for an hour and a half.
[00:53:36.504 --> 00:53:37.845]  That's always interesting.
[00:53:39.369 --> 00:53:42.430]  We are live, 8th day of January 2009.
[00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:55.095]  So Steve, as you said, the mere fact that they're out in the open about all this now, to put window dressing on it, is a sign historically that they're going for broke, that they've decided to fully engage their operation.
[00:53:55.095 --> 00:53:56.756]  What will that operation look like?
[00:53:57.312 --> 00:54:01.834]  Okay, I asked that specific question, and I'll get to the timing issue after I tell the operation.
[00:54:01.834 --> 00:54:15.361]  The operation is absolutely so planned out to the nth degree, and Alex, every day they have meetings and they discuss what I talk on my show, and I'm not flattering me or you, but they want to know how much we know.
[00:54:15.361 --> 00:54:20.123]  And every time we tell what we know, they plan around what we're telling the people.
[00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:21.504]  First of all, the Internet's going down.
[00:54:22.099 --> 00:54:26.660]  The guy said, you must tell your listeners the Internet's going down.
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:37.482]  By the way, the inventor of the Internet said Sunday in the BBC that it's quote, dying because the systems by design aren't being repaired or upgraded, so they're going to claim it's a failure.
[00:54:37.482 --> 00:54:39.422]  Absolutely, but let me say this too.
[00:54:39.422 --> 00:54:45.523]  I've gotten now multiple reports of the black box jammers being given to selected communities.
[00:54:45.523 --> 00:54:49.004]  Now, I don't know the communities that they expect to have the most.
[00:54:49.004 --> 00:54:51.364]  A black box jammer is something that will cut all
[00:54:52.074 --> 00:54:57.896]  Radio, all television, it cuts everything, and listen, in a 12-mile radius, okay?
[00:54:57.896 --> 00:54:59.836]  So it's a wide-spectrum jammer.
[00:54:59.836 --> 00:55:05.818]  It's a wide-spectrum jammer, and they have been handed out along with the individuals that know how to work with them.
[00:55:05.818 --> 00:55:09.819]  That's what the Russians used in Baghdad to jam cruise missiles.
[00:55:09.819 --> 00:55:14.461]  Absolutely, but it's getting, and so people say, well, I'll just call Steve or Alex on my cell phone.
[00:55:14.461 --> 00:55:15.041]  No, you won't.
[00:55:15.041 --> 00:55:16.401]  Well, I'll just get on my landline.
[00:55:16.401 --> 00:55:17.381]  No, you won't.
[00:55:17.381 --> 00:55:18.822]  Well, I'll just get on the shortwave.
[00:55:18.822 --> 00:55:19.502]  No, you won't.
[00:55:20.158 --> 00:55:26.801]  The thing is, Alex, and this is something that I said to the gentleman that I was having a talk with, I said, so what are you doing?
[00:55:26.801 --> 00:55:43.388]  He said, I'm buying, and this is his words, he said, I'm buying food, I'm buying the weapons to defend my family, and he said, I'm looking for a place too, because he said... But that's what I was going to say, what are they going to do when their own people walk off from NORAD and walk off from North Common, the police walk off to help their families?
[00:55:44.127 --> 00:55:45.509]  Then they bring in the foreign troops.
[00:55:45.509 --> 00:55:47.051]  And they bring in the foreign troops, and that's the other thing.
[00:55:47.051 --> 00:55:53.001]  You said, Steve, I'm seeing more and more foreign troops assigned to active duty U.S.
[00:55:53.001 --> 00:55:53.842]  troops stationed.
[00:55:53.842 --> 00:55:56.626]  By the way, you said the 30,000's a bunch of bunk.
[00:55:56.626 --> 00:55:58.228]  And by the way, people laugh at this.
[00:55:59.588 --> 00:56:01.790]  Twenty percent of the army is illegal aliens they hired.
[00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:06.014]  The biggest recruiting centers are in Manila, Philippines, the Mexico City, Ukraine.
[00:56:06.014 --> 00:56:07.716]  And then it's in major papers.
[00:56:07.716 --> 00:56:08.657]  They've signed deals.
[00:56:08.657 --> 00:56:13.301]  Remember Congress last year said we weren't told to use Canadian and Mexican troops in America.
[00:56:13.301 --> 00:56:15.083]  That was in the Toronto Star.
[00:56:15.083 --> 00:56:16.644]  Absolutely.
[00:56:16.644 --> 00:56:19.727]  And we can no longer call them the Shadow Boys, okay?
[00:56:19.727 --> 00:56:23.791]  I don't know if you saw on Drudge, but they showed five presidents, including current
[00:56:24.232 --> 00:56:33.916]  President-elect, and all I wish that someone would have drawn in, or someone would draw in, a cartoonist, is just the puppet strings going up above all of them with Illuminati.
[00:56:33.916 --> 00:56:35.597]  We own them all, okay?
[00:56:35.597 --> 00:56:37.738]  The thing is, is that this thing is so close.
[00:56:37.738 --> 00:56:39.539]  Here's his time period.
[00:56:39.539 --> 00:56:41.920]  He is extremely worried, okay?
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:44.181]  He said he is extremely worried about the next 90 days.
[00:56:45.303 --> 00:56:47.744]  Everything that's taking place in the Middle East plays into this.
[00:56:47.744 --> 00:56:50.004]  Everything that's taking place in the currency.
[00:56:50.004 --> 00:56:57.286]  I asked him flat-ass out, forgive the language, but I said, look, I gotta have this from you guys and be able to verify it.
[00:56:57.286 --> 00:57:06.089]  Is the Amaro really coming on board, or is that just another thing to keep us occupied and just go directly to cashless society?
[00:57:06.089 --> 00:57:06.809]  He said no.
[00:57:06.809 --> 00:57:11.430]  And by the way, I've had multiple verifications, although people say, oh, the Amaro, it's not printed.
[00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:21.717]  China demanded 1.3 trillion Ameros, which the Bush regime gave to them, or they would basically cancel and crash our currency.
[00:57:21.717 --> 00:57:23.799]  Now let's explain what that is.
[00:57:23.799 --> 00:57:35.909]  They announced a month ago in the New York Times that the Federal Reserve is issuing something above Treasury notes itself that is collateralized by North American assets.
[00:57:36.269 --> 00:57:37.870]  So that's your Amaro.
[00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:44.675]  It is above the stock market, above the bond market, international currency, cashless, above gold.
[00:57:44.675 --> 00:57:45.195]  Stay there.
[00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:46.576]  Steve Quayle is our guest.
[00:57:46.576 --> 00:57:51.339]  Transmission continues.
[00:57:51.339 --> 00:57:53.961]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:57:53.961 --> 00:58:00.105]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:00.105 --> 00:58:01.086]  On September 11th, 2001, along with
[00:58:03.294 --> 00:58:05.795]  Hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:58:05.795 --> 00:58:07.115]  And we knew what to do.
[00:58:07.115 --> 00:58:09.116]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:58:09.116 --> 00:58:16.138]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:58:16.138 --> 00:58:24.661]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:58:25.049 --> 00:58:32.172]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:58:32.172 --> 00:58:35.333]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:58:35.333 --> 00:58:41.096]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:58:41.096 --> 00:58:44.177]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:58:44.177 --> 00:58:50.640]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:54.060]  Big Brother.
[00:59:15.499 --> 00:59:19.042]  mainstream media government cover-ups.
[00:59:19.042 --> 00:59:20.623]  You want answers?
[00:59:20.623 --> 00:59:21.524]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:26.368]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:26.368 --> 00:59:32.393]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:32.393 --> 00:59:41.321]  We've got 30 minutes left with Steve Quayle, stevequayle.com, The Q-Files, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and the David Icke joining us.
[00:59:41.321 --> 00:59:43.522]  Okay, Steve, continuing,
[00:59:45.134 --> 00:59:51.941]  Just from your own study, not just this other source, your perspective on how they will trigger at some of the stage threats.
[00:59:51.941 --> 00:59:57.547]  Is it suitcase nukes carried out by the globalists blamed on Russia to start World War III?
[00:59:57.547 --> 01:00:01.350]  You know, everything Tom Clancy puts out basically comes true.
[01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:03.132]  Six years ago we put out a video game.
[01:00:04.373 --> 01:00:15.020]  Where NATO runs a sneak attack into South Ossetia to start a conflict that then in 2011 and 2012 leads to a nuclear war.
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:19.663]  Now they've put out the end war game where all of this happens and then world government comes out of it.
[01:00:19.663 --> 01:00:22.465]  They love this predictive programming.
[01:00:22.465 --> 01:00:24.386]  Or is it the economic collapse?
[01:00:24.386 --> 01:00:26.947]  Is it conventional stage terror attacks?
[01:00:26.947 --> 01:00:28.068]  Is it a wider war?
[01:00:28.068 --> 01:00:29.729]  An attack on Iran?
[01:00:29.729 --> 01:00:30.710]  What do you see unfolding?
[01:00:31.147 --> 01:00:35.190]  I see all of the above, and let me first of all take the suitcase nuke thing.
[01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:46.257]  Alex, that's what launched me on my radio career 15 years ago, because after the situation with Russia and the whole glass-nosed perestroika... Alexander Leavitt.
[01:00:46.257 --> 01:00:46.917]  You got it.
[01:00:46.917 --> 01:00:48.178]  Alexander Leavitt, by the way.
[01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:52.181]  I was in the process, and I'm not saying he was murdered because I was trying to interview him.
[01:00:52.557 --> 01:00:58.900]  But when Lebed testified, or Lebed testified before the Walden Committee, he was telling me exactly what happened.
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:17.270]  I actually talked to different people that were arms brokers from that part of the world, especially Eastern Europe, and when I say you could get anything you want, you could get the deal handled in Vienna, you could basically go to any of the stands, and those days, the going price for what would be called a suitcase nuke is five million bucks.
[01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:21.592]  Now, what was fascinating, when I interviewed different black market guys,
[01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:23.391]  We're good to go.
[01:01:44.353 --> 01:01:47.494]  Uh, specific mouthpieces, all those things don't exist.
[01:01:47.494 --> 01:01:49.254]  Alexander Labette was murdered.
[01:01:49.254 --> 01:02:05.119]  He was called a... Well, on our side, the oldest model was a Davy Crockett, and there's all sorts of strategic... But listen, it's way beyond that now, because again, when the whole thing came out with Red Mercury, I was the first guy to interview Sam Cohen, the inventor of the neutron bomb, okay?
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:14.607]  When I would talk about red mercury, and not the stuff that was trying to be sold on eBay that was basically mercury with a dyna, but red mercury is an atomic, if you will.
[01:02:14.607 --> 01:02:16.188]  It's got to be put into a reactor.
[01:02:16.188 --> 01:02:18.770]  It's mercury antimony oxide.
[01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:21.572]  I mean, it's an atomic byproduct.
[01:02:21.572 --> 01:02:23.093]  It comes out of a nuclear pile.
[01:02:23.493 --> 01:02:24.474]  Yes, it does.
[01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:28.216]  But I mean, you know, I hear you've got, I've got the inventor of the neutron bomb.
[01:02:28.216 --> 01:02:38.241]  By the way, telling me that the United States government gave that to China, courtesy of George Bush Senior, the inventor of the neutron bomb was present when the design for the neutron bomb was given to China.
[01:02:38.241 --> 01:02:45.225]  But he told me, he said, Steve, I interviewed Sam Cohen, I think eight times, and had massive conversations with him off air.
[01:02:45.225 --> 01:02:48.227]  And here's, here's the thing, Alex, this is no longer old
[01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:49.189]  We're good.
[01:03:07.381 --> 01:03:11.102]  And they tell, you know, I always get told, why would anybody tell you stuff?
[01:03:11.102 --> 01:03:11.822]  Simple.
[01:03:11.822 --> 01:03:13.503]  Because I'm trying to tell it like it is.
[01:03:13.503 --> 01:03:16.423]  I'm trying to warn people like it is, like you are.
[01:03:16.423 --> 01:03:21.045]  And, you know, I can't tell you how many of those devices have been disarmed in the United States.
[01:03:21.045 --> 01:03:22.845]  People said, oh, well, you know what?
[01:03:22.845 --> 01:03:31.808]  But then they could not deny the seismic tracings of, gee, why did all that seismic activity happen on July 15th, you know, a number of years ago?
[01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:34.148]  The point is, is what I'm trying to say is this.
[01:03:34.148 --> 01:03:36.769]  We are so mind-controlled that you and I could present
[01:03:37.399 --> 01:03:46.848]  Living, actual testimony, and you know the CIA already ran a study on this and said only 46% of Americans would see it if they saw it.
[01:03:46.848 --> 01:03:50.131]  Believe it, if they saw it with their own eyes... Stay there!
[01:03:50.131 --> 01:03:50.251]  46%.
[01:03:50.251 --> 01:03:58.659]  I want to talk more about neutron weapons because, of course, this is a radiation burst, not a hot flash air burst, and it kills all living
[01:04:01.942 --> 01:04:12.211]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:12.211 --> 01:04:16.955]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:04:16.955 --> 01:04:19.917]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:04:19.917 --> 01:04:22.980]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:27.684]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:04:27.904 --> 01:04:29.085]  If you simply prepare.
[01:04:29.085 --> 01:04:32.830]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest.
[01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:34.892]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[01:04:34.892 --> 01:04:36.714]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[01:04:36.714 --> 01:04:40.699]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[01:04:40.699 --> 01:04:43.122]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[01:04:43.502 --> 01:04:52.632]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[01:04:52.632 --> 01:04:59.741]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days, until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[01:04:59.741 --> 01:05:01.743]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[01:05:01.943 --> 01:05:04.165]  There seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[01:05:04.165 --> 01:05:09.870]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:13.113]  The stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business.
[01:05:13.113 --> 01:05:16.476]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[01:05:16.476 --> 01:05:18.297]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[01:05:18.297 --> 01:05:22.001]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[01:05:22.361 --> 01:05:26.462]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[01:05:26.462 --> 01:05:34.023]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[01:05:34.023 --> 01:05:37.964]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[01:05:37.964 --> 01:05:41.185]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:05:41.185 --> 01:05:48.066]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:05:48.186 --> 01:05:52.969]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:05:52.969 --> 01:05:56.611]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.

[01:06:08.498 --> 01:06:09.799]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:06:18.823 --> 01:06:24.246]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:32.051]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:06:32.051 --> 01:06:40.716]  Ian Fleming, who was a member of MI6, OSS before that, who founded our CIA.
[01:06:40.716 --> 01:06:44.899]  His second book was Moonraker.
[01:06:44.899 --> 01:06:46.019]  Written back in the 50's.
[01:06:48.208 --> 01:07:01.994]  And then it was turned into a movie in the 70s with Roger Moore, where an evil mastermind over an international banking cartel wants to release a biological weapon to kill all humans on Earth, but then it phases out in a year.
[01:07:01.994 --> 01:07:05.416]  They're going to live on a space station while we all die.
[01:07:05.416 --> 01:07:17.581]  Well, again, they throw it in our face in popular culture, like before 9-11, Fox Television, and I even had one of the stars of the show, the X-Files lone gunman, Dean Haglund, call me and say, I want to come meet with you.
[01:07:18.427 --> 01:07:20.508]  And this guy was scared, and we interviewed him at my house.
[01:07:20.508 --> 01:07:23.009]  That video's up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:23.009 --> 01:07:26.750]  And he said, listen, the CIA came and planted these plots on us.
[01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:43.736]  Six months before 9-11, the secret group in the government, above the government, hijacks a jet by remote control, uses an anti-terror drill to make NORAD stand down, telling them it's a drill, to fly a jet, a large passenger jet in the World Trade Center, as a pretext to attack Afghanistan.
[01:07:43.736 --> 01:07:47.698]  Now, of course, Tom Clancy also wrote a book about something similar.
[01:07:49.181 --> 01:07:55.668]  They do this predictive programming to mix reality with unreality to prepare the subconscious mind.
[01:07:55.668 --> 01:08:00.493]  Now that said, we're going back to Moonraker, where the elites plan to kill us.
[01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:07.700]  They could use biological, they could use chemical, they're using soft kill on us right now with the chemtrails and the fluoride and the mercury.
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:11.705]  We had Dr. Blaylock, the top brain surgeon on, breaking all this down last Friday.
[01:08:13.997 --> 01:08:25.206]  One of their plans, and this is even alluded to in the British Ministry of Defense report for the 10-year trend, what they believe will happen, they said governments will use neutron weapons to control their populations.
[01:08:25.206 --> 01:08:32.993]  Because if we were to try to rebel, the military would try to rebel and take over Washington and restore the Constitution, the black-op government will use neutron bombs to kill them.
[01:08:32.993 --> 01:08:34.014]  That is stated.
[01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:41.869]  Now they can't stop us taking over all the other cities peacefully and politically saying no and pointing out that we know you're planning to use neutron weapons.
[01:08:41.869 --> 01:08:45.032]  Then they really can't do it because politically it would expose them.
[01:08:45.032 --> 01:08:50.759]  But that's the level of total full-spectrum dominance is the term they're using.
[01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:56.265]  And everybody in NORTHCOM needs to know you're working for people at the highest levels above you who are planning this.
[01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:57.066]  Steve Coyle comments.
[01:08:58.114 --> 01:09:14.800]  Absolutely, in the situation that's gone on, if it hadn't been for some pretty amazing people in your area, that, as you know, Austin, just, you know, the central hub for a lot of special operations and everything, if it hadn't been for some of the bravest men and women, Alex, we'd already been there.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.561]  Let me talk about the dissemination neutron weapon.
[01:09:17.561 --> 01:09:21.043]  It is a neutron weapon killed by an intense radiation burst.
[01:09:21.043 --> 01:09:24.664]  It does not have the standard thermal signature, it doesn't have the
[01:09:25.137 --> 01:09:31.099]  Fallout, which is debris that's basically blown up in the upper atmosphere that becomes radioactive and falls out.
[01:09:31.099 --> 01:09:37.842]  And, you know, you can take a baseball-sized, actually a softball-sized weapon device and kill everything within one square mile.
[01:09:37.842 --> 01:09:47.346]  And the thing that I don't think people recognize, now supposedly, George Bush, the father, took our neutron weapons out of our arsenal.
[01:09:47.346 --> 01:09:49.046]  I don't believe that for a minute.
[01:09:49.046 --> 01:09:53.228]  And given the fact that we've got the situation now going where this stuff is in the hands of terrorists,
[01:09:53.641 --> 01:09:57.403]  And everything else is basically, when I say terrorist, I'm talking about the Illuminati, okay?
[01:09:57.403 --> 01:09:58.423]  I want to make that clear.
[01:09:58.423 --> 01:10:01.345]  Yeah, like, it's literally chaos.
[01:10:01.345 --> 01:10:03.166]  I mean, it's literally chaos.
[01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:09.149]  But let me tell you what this guy said, because again, when I get someone that I run into, you know, I basically tried to be a watchman.
[01:10:09.149 --> 01:10:11.290]  I tried to warn, warn, warn, warn, warn.
[01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:12.030]  It's Spectre.
[01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:12.611]  It's Spectre.
[01:10:12.611 --> 01:10:13.591]  Go ahead.
[01:10:13.591 --> 01:10:19.154]  The bottom line is there, he, the gentleman I had the meeting with, is really worried about a severe
[01:10:19.821 --> 01:10:25.085]  Biological attack that's going to be launched upon the United States by the United States.
[01:10:25.085 --> 01:10:28.367]  And they just announced confirmed bird flu deaths in China.
[01:10:28.367 --> 01:10:28.587]  Yep.
[01:10:28.587 --> 01:10:30.048]  Now let me share this with you.
[01:10:30.048 --> 01:10:33.470]  I got a call from a homicide detective in the central US.
[01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:34.271]  Okay.
[01:10:34.271 --> 01:10:40.135]  He said that his, one of his men, one of his lead detectives, homicide detective is a national guard.
[01:10:40.135 --> 01:10:46.399]  He was at a meeting and a general was brought in from Washington to discuss what's getting ready to happen.
[01:10:47.034 --> 01:10:55.476]  And he talked about the biological event, by the way, this man's police department was called, given the biogear and everything, but it was in the heartland, okay?
[01:10:55.476 --> 01:11:07.319]  And his exact words, I can't say it on the radio, but he said if the American people understood all the deadly fecal contaminant we're gonna throw at them, they'd absolutely die on their feet.
[01:11:07.319 --> 01:11:09.600]  So, this is kind of weird, okay?
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.240]  And he, you know, obviously a lot of people are used to such brash talk.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.221]  Here's what I'm saying, Alex, it's no longer
[01:11:15.666 --> 01:11:21.608]  There's no more time left for people just to be spectators, just to basically get on a board and say, well, what did Alex say?
[01:11:21.608 --> 01:11:22.648]  What did Steve say?
[01:11:22.648 --> 01:11:23.728]  They've got to get involved.
[01:11:23.728 --> 01:11:24.949]  They've got to buy the tapes.
[01:11:24.949 --> 01:11:28.950]  And when I say this, your tapes have gone around the world, okay?
[01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:35.091]  And the thing that people don't understand is that we do on a shoestring budget what these guys do with $9 trillion.
[01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:37.752]  By the way, all that money that was put into the banking system,
[01:11:38.453 --> 01:11:40.874]  I know one of the largest gold traders in the world.
[01:11:40.874 --> 01:11:43.836]  He sells in metric tons and hundreds of metric tons.
[01:11:43.836 --> 01:11:48.738]  He told me all that money is being filtered out of the banks, through the Orient, into gold.
[01:11:48.738 --> 01:11:55.102]  And I can tell you this, based on his receipts and my verification of what he's done, he has told me stuff.
[01:11:55.102 --> 01:12:03.606]  By the way, the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, here's something no one knows, it'll be turned into now, has been turned into the International Monetary Authority.
[01:12:04.062 --> 01:12:10.206]  So when all the paper currencies crash, these guys are all saying, well look, we got all the gold, we're going to issue a currency that's gold-based.
[01:12:10.206 --> 01:12:12.887]  This goes beyond the emerald, this goes beyond the euro.
[01:12:12.887 --> 01:12:14.608]  But before that, total chaos.
[01:12:14.608 --> 01:12:25.655]  You and I have talked about it, screamed about it, you've filmed about it, I've written about it, but the point is they want total chaos, and out of that chaos will arise the Phoenix or the New World Order.
[01:12:25.655 --> 01:12:33.379]  But in the meantime, when I get people from all branches of the military, when I get people from all branches of government,
[01:12:33.735 --> 01:12:46.325]  When I get people, former Secretaries of State, Assistant Secretaries of State, all these different people telling me the same stuff, and coming so fast and furious that, and some of them, by the way, have left the country.
[01:12:46.325 --> 01:12:53.090]  The point is, is that there's so little time for people to just say, well I need more evidence, I need more evidence, goodnight.
[01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:58.434]  What you need is cojones, and you'd better decide that you've got to use the evidence.
[01:12:58.434 --> 01:13:01.797]  And Alex, it's like everybody's got a set of scales before their eyes.
[01:13:02.262 --> 01:13:07.984]  In one end is all the information you and I and others give them, and then there's this doubt.
[01:13:07.984 --> 01:13:18.527]  Instead of looking at the mountains of confirmed, in-your-face, admitted that they're getting ready for martial law and mass arrest in FEMA camps in major papers, they come and attack us and say we're full of baloney.
[01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:24.369]  That's COINTELPRO, that's operatives, but it's also weak-minded people who've been conditioned by the lies and system.
[01:13:24.369 --> 01:13:25.849]  Folks, it's all happening.
[01:13:25.849 --> 01:13:30.631]  Bloomberg is reporting that a Fed governor, by name,
[01:13:31.696 --> 01:13:41.243]  is saying even local Fed branches have been told you are under war powers, you can't ask questions, Congress can't ask questions, and Congress has been told they're under war powers.
[01:13:41.243 --> 01:13:52.971]  And PDD 51 and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act states the states, the Congress, the judicial has no power, it's of course criminal to do this, it's illegitimate, but they're doing it, that it's all under the executive.
[01:13:53.351 --> 01:13:59.394]  And the executive, whether it's George Bush or Barack H. Obama, is controlled by the internationalists, openly by the world banks.
[01:13:59.394 --> 01:14:00.895]  They are taking us down.
[01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:02.715]  This is a corporate receivership.
[01:14:02.715 --> 01:14:12.300]  Now, you talk about people on the system stopping it, and I know that people with leaks and info and things that are just amazing that people have gone through to stop this.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:14.181]  And to back it off and to warn people.
[01:14:14.181 --> 01:14:22.507]  That's why 20, 30 years ago, everything that's now declassified, the old timers who were always colonels or generals retired would say, we funded Mao, we put Mao in.
[01:14:22.507 --> 01:14:24.248]  Now it's on History Channel, they admit it.
[01:14:24.248 --> 01:14:26.029]  You know, there's a plan to put you in FEMA camp.
[01:14:26.029 --> 01:14:27.570]  There's a plan to exterminate you.
[01:14:27.570 --> 01:14:28.991]  Now it's declassified.
[01:14:28.991 --> 01:14:29.772]  They were there.
[01:14:29.772 --> 01:14:30.572]  They were brief.
[01:14:30.572 --> 01:14:31.853]  That's why they warned us.
[01:14:31.853 --> 01:14:36.276]  That's why the right-wing patriot militia people, you know, formed.
[01:14:36.276 --> 01:14:39.938]  Because we had good patriots in government that did warn us.
[01:14:39.938 --> 01:14:42.500]  Are there ways to stop this or is this going to happen?
[01:14:43.581 --> 01:14:49.925]  It's going to happen, but the way it's going to happen, first of all, it's going to happen at such an accelerated pace.
[01:14:49.925 --> 01:14:54.729]  You asked me if it's going to be financial, it's going to be Russia, China, all of the above.
[01:14:54.729 --> 01:15:01.674]  Right now, obviously, you know that goodnight Lebanon rockets have been fired into northern Israel from Lebanon.
[01:15:01.674 --> 01:15:04.296]  And Israel's been responding and saying they may invade, yeah?
[01:15:04.296 --> 01:15:04.836]  Yeah.
[01:15:04.836 --> 01:15:06.918]  And see, the thing is, this is all scripted.
[01:15:06.918 --> 01:15:09.760]  This is something I don't think, you know, Alex, you refer to Tom Clancy.
[01:15:10.261 --> 01:15:16.695]  I remember going public with all of the science fiction producers in Hollywood that had been contacted by the CIA.
[01:15:17.512 --> 01:15:23.296]  That's why you have Steven Spielberg having the largest collection, and I'm not going to go there, but Alien Artifacts.
[01:15:23.296 --> 01:15:30.521]  You've got the former Star Trek head Gene Roddeberry being basically the guy that was so tied in.
[01:15:30.521 --> 01:15:33.403]  And I had one of the CIA's top agents, double agent, tell me.
[01:15:33.403 --> 01:15:38.167]  Well, he was the heir apparent to Aleister Crowley and ran the OTO.
[01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:38.887]  You got it.
[01:15:38.887 --> 01:15:40.929]  And then the head of the Jet Propulsion System, yeah.
[01:15:41.323 --> 01:15:47.970]  Yeah, but when you and I talk about that stuff, see, what we've got to get now is we've got to get people to absolutely, can I tell you something?
[01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:49.272]  You've given bits and pieces.
[01:15:49.272 --> 01:15:50.753]  You've given the borders.
[01:15:50.753 --> 01:15:53.937]  I, I, I, sometimes you take, it takes an obscure piece.
[01:15:53.937 --> 01:15:57.020]  All the pieces fit now, Alex, and it's their timing.
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:00.124]  This biological event, that's the thing that they're going to do.
[01:16:00.124 --> 01:16:01.205]  Because, let me share this with you.
[01:16:01.773 --> 01:16:11.936]  On their level of terror, they have it all so psychologically computerized, they know that a bio-event carries ten times the weight of a nuclear event.
[01:16:11.936 --> 01:16:15.277]  War games, it makes everybody isolate, makes everybody freeze.
[01:16:15.277 --> 01:16:15.657]  Right.
[01:16:15.657 --> 01:16:17.938]  Panic and terror, and they put them right in their spot.
[01:16:17.938 --> 01:16:24.820]  By the way, when I asked the question, I did not get answered, is on the black box jammers, will they shut down all newer vehicles too?
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:26.100]  As you know, the police have different
[01:16:26.548 --> 01:16:31.911]  Electromagnetic type things that they can shut the ignitions down on newer cars.
[01:16:31.911 --> 01:16:39.374]  I do not know that these black box jammers that are the broad spectrum jammers will do that, but I know they also have those.
[01:16:39.374 --> 01:16:47.278]  So the critical thing that everyone needs to know is, look, how many times have we told everybody, our listeners, mutual listeners, the interviews we've done?
[01:16:47.278 --> 01:16:54.982]  You didn't just say, I remember you 10 years ago, you didn't just say we'd have an economic collapse, you said it would be triggered by the derivatives by design, and that's what happened.
[01:16:55.487 --> 01:16:56.447]  Absolutely.
[01:16:56.447 --> 01:17:00.309]  And you know, I'm sure you get tired of the same old critics.
[01:17:00.309 --> 01:17:09.333]  I'm going to tell you people that are on boards, that are on blogs, the people that rise up when they're attacking the messenger, I ask them, I say, well, what's your pay grade?
[01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:10.874]  And they say, well, what do you mean, what's your pay grade?
[01:17:10.874 --> 01:17:13.175]  I said, you obviously work for them.
[01:17:13.175 --> 01:17:19.698]  And I can tell you this, the thing that most people want to be able to do, most normal human beings want to be able to provide for their family security.
[01:17:20.371 --> 01:17:28.141]  Yeah, the people that are serving the New World Order are destroying their own future.
[01:17:28.141 --> 01:17:30.243]  They're burning their own house down.
[01:17:30.243 --> 01:17:33.447]  And I don't think they understand just how horrific the final endgame is.
[01:17:33.447 --> 01:17:34.308]  They have no idea.
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:41.981]  It doesn't matter if it's Merkel in Germany.
[01:17:41.981 --> 01:17:44.323]  These guys are not committing suicide.
[01:17:44.323 --> 01:17:47.305]  That's right, I've got a stack of billionaires being killed.
[01:17:47.305 --> 01:17:48.145]  Right.
[01:17:48.145 --> 01:17:51.788]  And here's what the word came to me from Beijing, okay?
[01:17:51.788 --> 01:17:55.070]  Beijing said that trillionaires are wiping out the billionaires.
[01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:57.531]  And the guy said to me, he said, guess who the trillionaires are, Steve?
[01:17:57.531 --> 01:17:59.393]  I said, easy, it's the puppet masters.
[01:17:59.393 --> 01:18:02.975]  They don't want any ability to contest them.
[01:18:02.975 --> 01:18:05.977]  They let them get filled up only long enough to destroy them and take them down.
[01:18:07.011 --> 01:18:09.014]  Yeah, they killed one of the richest guys in Germany.
[01:18:09.014 --> 01:18:10.016]  That's actually in my stack.
[01:18:10.016 --> 01:18:12.881]  We'll mention that when we get back with Steve Quayle's final segment.
[01:18:12.881 --> 01:18:14.804]  Steve, I've got to have you back up in the near future.
[01:18:14.804 --> 01:18:16.968]  We're heading into the quickening right now.
[01:18:16.968 --> 01:18:17.809]  SteveQuayle.com.
[01:18:17.809 --> 01:18:18.210]  Stay with us.
[01:18:19.383 --> 01:18:20.283]  You worry.
[01:18:20.283 --> 01:18:22.364]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:25.005]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:18:25.005 --> 01:18:27.125]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:28.726]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:18:28.726 --> 01:18:32.327]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:18:32.327 --> 01:18:37.568]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:18:37.568 --> 01:18:41.530]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:43.210]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:18:43.210 --> 01:18:46.131]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:18:46.131 --> 01:18:49.072]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:18:49.574 --> 01:18:58.216]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.

[01:19:07.057 --> 01:19:10.958]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:19:10.958 --> 01:19:12.458]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:19:12.458 --> 01:19:14.178]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:19:19.710 --> 01:19:21.931]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[01:19:21.931 --> 01:19:24.873]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[01:19:24.873 --> 01:19:33.477]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[01:19:33.477 --> 01:19:37.139]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:41.681]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[01:19:41.681 --> 01:19:43.282]  How much are you willing to lose?
[01:19:43.662 --> 01:19:44.723]  Take action now!
[01:19:44.723 --> 01:19:49.526]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[01:19:49.526 --> 01:19:53.509]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[01:19:53.509 --> 01:19:56.831]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[01:19:56.831 --> 01:20:03.276]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[01:20:03.576 --> 01:20:09.542]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[01:20:09.542 --> 01:20:11.864]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[01:20:11.864 --> 01:20:13.645]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[01:20:13.645 --> 01:20:14.486]  It is a big idea.
[01:20:14.486 --> 01:20:15.027]  A new world order.
[01:20:15.027 --> 01:20:15.607]  In the near future.
[01:20:25.288 --> 01:20:28.351]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:20:28.351 --> 01:20:31.173]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:31.173 --> 01:20:33.976]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:20:33.976 --> 01:20:37.158]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:37.158 --> 01:20:44.465]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:47.512 --> 01:20:52.936]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:52.936 --> 01:20:56.818]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:59.380]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:00.541]  Most people have no idea.
[01:21:00.541 --> 01:21:01.341]  They're not after money.
[01:21:01.341 --> 01:21:02.602]  They have all the money they need.
[01:21:02.602 --> 01:21:03.583]  They're after power.
[01:21:03.583 --> 01:21:04.744]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[01:21:04.744 --> 01:21:09.507]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:21:09.507 --> 01:21:13.449]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:13.449 --> 01:21:16.271]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslaving.
[01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:17.352]  You have been warned.
[01:21:17.432 --> 01:21:18.072]  Yeah.
[01:21:36.001 --> 01:21:40.083]  Clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[01:21:40.083 --> 01:21:42.845]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[01:21:42.845 --> 01:21:54.431]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[01:21:54.431 --> 01:22:00.854]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[01:22:00.854 --> 01:22:04.596]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an
[01:22:04.776 --> 01:22:08.758]  Excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.
[01:22:08.758 --> 01:22:11.680]  Order some today at FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:13.521]  Again, that's FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[01:22:13.521 --> 01:22:14.021]  Or call 888-949-3570.
[01:22:14.021 --> 01:22:14.822]  Steve Quayle again.
[01:22:14.822 --> 01:22:16.323]  I'm going to get you up in the near future.
[01:22:39.079 --> 01:22:40.340]  All the games are over.
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:41.280]  All the denials.
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.260]  We were right about it all.
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:43.341]  We studied the New World Order.
[01:22:43.341 --> 01:22:45.262]  We got our facts straight.
[01:22:45.262 --> 01:22:50.904]  And now the enemy's coming down on us with economic conquest and physical conquest.
[01:22:50.904 --> 01:22:56.666]  We can educate the public in a crash course that this is all being done to destroy their future.
[01:22:56.666 --> 01:23:01.068]  Let the public understand that working through the system will destroy them.
[01:23:01.068 --> 01:23:03.629]  We can maybe turn this around if we hem our knees and
[01:23:04.756 --> 01:23:12.366]  Ask God to forgive us, but 50 million abortions later, God isn't in a mood, I don't think, to do that.
[01:23:12.366 --> 01:23:13.687]  And the evil just increases.
[01:23:13.687 --> 01:23:18.834]  You know, in every case in history, Steve, when a nation becomes wicked, it becomes conquered and enslaved and massacred.
[01:23:18.834 --> 01:23:21.037]  And it looks like that's coming now to the Western world.
[01:23:21.547 --> 01:23:31.135]  Well, absolutely, and when people ask me what they can do, and I'm serious, I say this, don't worry about Nostradamus, don't worry about 2012, worry about what Jesus, who's the book of revelations written about.
[01:23:31.135 --> 01:23:32.976]  And I make no apologies.
[01:23:32.976 --> 01:23:38.901]  People have got to get their hearts right with Jesus, because this thing is not only in the natural realm, it's in the supernatural realm.
[01:23:38.901 --> 01:23:44.686]  Alex, you spent so much of your time and effort in your documentary about the Bohemian Grove.
[01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:50.110]  There are guys that are absolutely blood-sacrificing Luciferians
[01:23:50.563 --> 01:23:57.530]  Who offer live children to, you know, incredibly evil entities, and these are the rulers and leaders of the world.
[01:23:57.530 --> 01:23:59.132]  I want to say something about gun control too.
[01:23:59.642 --> 01:24:02.824]  The bottom line is anyone that will take your gun will take your life.
[01:24:30.162 --> 01:24:33.384]  Right, and I've got to say this, and I've said this, and I've been told this.
[01:24:33.384 --> 01:24:39.426]  I've been told this by multi, multi, numerous, too many sources.
[01:24:39.426 --> 01:24:45.569]  I mean, and generals and admirals I don't know through friends of mine, but they all say the same thing.
[01:24:45.569 --> 01:24:46.569]  The bottom line is,
[01:24:46.909 --> 01:24:48.590]  This thing's going to get really bad.
[01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:49.550]  Stay out of it.
[01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:50.610]  By the way, there's going to be a fight.
[01:24:50.610 --> 01:24:51.951]  There's been a fight going on in the military.
[01:24:51.951 --> 01:24:54.452]  You know, I talk about that and people say, oh, how would he know?
[01:24:54.452 --> 01:24:56.452]  Well, obviously I can't know unless someone tells me.
[01:24:56.452 --> 01:25:06.056]  Wait a minute, there was an Army Times article that the military, they do a poll every year, is the most unhappy with the federal government in its history, even more than Vietnam.
[01:25:06.056 --> 01:25:07.816]  And they don't trust Obama.
[01:25:07.816 --> 01:25:11.478]  And the thing is, remember how the Marines greeted Obama with silence.
[01:25:11.478 --> 01:25:14.259]  That's why he wants a civilian police force, i.e.
[01:25:14.259 --> 01:25:15.119]  equally armed.
[01:25:15.663 --> 01:25:17.164]  To equal the military.
[01:25:17.164 --> 01:25:19.585]  Look, there are some wonderful people.
[01:25:19.585 --> 01:25:20.565]  I owe my life.
[01:25:20.565 --> 01:25:21.626]  You owe your life.
[01:25:21.626 --> 01:25:29.810]  We don't know all of our lives we owe, and literally, to some pretty amazing people that at one time were located out of Austin.
[01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:30.490]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:25:30.490 --> 01:25:31.091]  Wait a minute.
[01:25:31.091 --> 01:25:43.997]  We know that just six months ago, Fox Fallon had to resign for refusing to stage terror attacks, and that it was military that refused, the Navy SEALs refused, to stage terror attacks on our Navy ships for Dick Cheney.
[01:25:44.702 --> 01:25:53.964]  Absolutely, and I can tell you this, that when Black Ops A fight Black Ops B, people die and it's usually written off as a training accident.
[01:25:53.964 --> 01:25:59.206]  Again, Alex, this is something that I don't think people understand.
[01:25:59.206 --> 01:26:03.367]  What makes me furious is that these men and women are some of the bravest
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:15.142]  And they are some of the most absolutely, when I say invisible to the natural eye, they have to fight in secret, they die in secret, and their motto is that we all might live.
[01:26:15.142 --> 01:26:21.323]  And I want to say to those men and women, I don't know if they're at Alpha Site or wherever, but God bless you, thank you.
[01:26:21.323 --> 01:26:32.525]  There are a whole bunch of intercessors out there praying for the mighty men and women of valor, and the entire military that took an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States, and are not going to roll over and let the demons and these devils from hell
[01:26:33.225 --> 01:26:36.927]  And that's why they're bringing in foreign troops.
[01:26:36.927 --> 01:26:43.751]  And remember it was in the mainstream AP a couple years ago that they're not just hiring foreigners, they're hiring aggravated felons.
[01:26:43.751 --> 01:26:45.792]  That means violent, arsonists, rapists.
[01:26:45.792 --> 01:26:49.213]  That was in the news, Washington Times and AP.
[01:26:49.213 --> 01:26:50.614]  People cannot believe this.
[01:26:50.614 --> 01:26:55.377]  They're replacing everybody with crooks and nuts and psychopaths and low IQ people.
[01:26:56.697 --> 01:26:58.078]  This is such a battle coming up.
[01:26:58.078 --> 01:27:01.799]  Folks, find out more about Steve Quayle at SteveQuayle.com.
[01:27:01.799 --> 01:27:05.941]  SteveQuayle.com and all the great books and materials and information and we should support him.
[01:27:05.941 --> 01:27:10.203]  I want to get you back up if you'll do it in the next few weeks for two hours so we can take phone calls, Steve.
[01:27:10.203 --> 01:27:11.864]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:27:11.864 --> 01:27:12.504]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:27:12.504 --> 01:27:13.485]  Bye-bye.
[01:27:13.485 --> 01:27:14.745]  God bless you, sir.
[01:27:14.745 --> 01:27:20.028]  Okay, we've got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts coming up in the next segment and then David Icke.
[01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:28.886]  Speaking of getting the word out, ladies and gentlemen, the number one thing you can do is not buy the books and videos off InfoWars.com.
[01:27:28.886 --> 01:27:33.530]  That's important to support us and to get the films and make copies of Endgame, TerrorStorm, and things like that.
[01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:40.376]  The most important thing to do is to tell your email list, your MySpace, your church, print up flyers, your business, work.
[01:27:40.896 --> 01:27:41.076]  I think.
[01:28:02.816 --> 01:28:04.377]  They know we're telling them the truth.
[01:28:04.377 --> 01:28:06.439]  They heard us years ago say this and laughed at us.
[01:28:06.439 --> 01:28:07.480]  Now they've seen it come true.
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:08.380]  They're finally listening.
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:09.621]  Now's the time to wake people up.
[01:28:09.621 --> 01:28:11.023]  We're on the march.
[01:28:11.023 --> 01:28:13.565]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:13.565 --> 01:28:16.247]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:19.013 --> 01:28:22.497]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:28:22.497 --> 01:28:26.281]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:28:26.281 --> 01:28:32.608]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[01:28:32.608 --> 01:28:36.693]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:28:37.213 --> 01:28:43.237]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:28:43.237 --> 01:28:46.659]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:28:46.659 --> 01:28:51.302]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:28:51.302 --> 01:28:57.547]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:28:57.547 --> 01:29:02.510]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:06.433]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[01:29:07.153 --> 01:29:14.237]  MySolarBackup.com today or call 877-327-0365.
[01:29:14.237 --> 01:29:17.139]  877-327-0365.
[01:29:17.139 --> 01:29:17.820]  Don't wait.
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:19.221]  Call today.
[01:29:19.221 --> 01:29:25.985]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:29:25.985 --> 01:29:27.646]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:29:28.621 --> 01:29:30.162]  But who is the enemy?
[01:29:30.162 --> 01:29:30.962]  Bin Laden.
[01:29:30.962 --> 01:29:32.002]  This is his M.O.
[01:29:32.002 --> 01:29:33.343]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:29:33.343 --> 01:29:35.323]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:29:35.323 --> 01:29:42.466]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:29:42.466 --> 01:29:42.946]  Some U.S.
[01:29:42.946 --> 01:29:48.588]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:29:49.308 --> 01:29:52.811]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:29:52.811 --> 01:29:55.613]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:26.593]  IonicZone.com has the best prices on commercial shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[01:30:26.593 --> 01:30:33.536]  But did you know IonicZone.com also sells a water ozonator that's a must-have for anyone interested in good health?
[01:30:33.536 --> 01:30:34.256]  It's true.
[01:30:34.256 --> 01:30:43.040]  The IonicZone digital water ozonator features an air intake and can be fed dry air through the supplied air dryer or pure oxygen via an oxygen tank.
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:53.267]  Ozone-fortified water can be used to kill bacteria, sanitize food, produce, and eliminates bacteria in the mouth by gargling, which helps prevent bad breath and even heart disease.
[01:30:53.267 --> 01:31:00.271]  The optional ozone bidet attachment is used for personal hygiene, which can kill the bacteria down below that can lead to irritation.
[01:31:00.271 --> 01:31:03.514]  It's amazing what three atoms of oxygen can do!
[01:31:03.514 --> 01:31:05.035]  Call Ionic Zone today at 1-800-549-9535.
[01:31:05.035 --> 01:31:05.455]  That's 1-800-549-9535.
[01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:15.662]  Some folks are born with a silver spoon in their hand.
[01:31:15.662 --> 01:31:16.743]  Don't they help themselves?
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:34.160]  That's a...
[01:31:57.242 --> 01:31:58.403]  Allusion to tyranny!
[01:31:58.403 --> 01:32:05.146]  What did Caesar do when he brought the troops across the Rubicon two thousand and sixty-something years ago?
[01:32:05.146 --> 01:32:17.032]  He brought his troops into Rome to dominate the Senate.
[01:32:17.032 --> 01:32:18.913]  It's all happening.
[01:32:18.913 --> 01:32:22.715]  Bloomberg reported several weeks ago that war powers has been declared.
[01:32:22.715 --> 01:32:24.856]  Former Fed Governor said that
[01:32:26.874 --> 01:32:30.457]  The New York Fed is running the Treasury, everything, it's all secret.
[01:32:30.457 --> 01:32:33.599]  Trillions missing.
[01:32:33.599 --> 01:32:35.721]  Israel is bombarding Gaza now.
[01:32:35.721 --> 01:32:40.144]  Supposedly rockets have been fired last night into northern Israel out of Lebanon.
[01:32:40.144 --> 01:32:40.844]  They're responding.
[01:32:40.844 --> 01:32:43.527]  Israel's talking about invading now.
[01:32:43.527 --> 01:32:45.488]  China's talking about not buying U.S.
[01:32:45.488 --> 01:32:46.189]  debt anymore.
[01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:51.633]  Obama's announcing spending our way out of the crises and giving a trillion bucks to select cronies.
[01:32:53.004 --> 01:33:07.338]  I can think of no one better to get on for a half hour than best-selling author, lecturer, researcher, syndicative columnist, father of Reaganomics, former head of policy, Department of Treasury under Ronald Reagan, a true conservative, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:33:07.338 --> 01:33:09.139]  Doctor, it's good to have you here with us.
[01:33:09.139 --> 01:33:10.020]  Well, hello, Alex.
[01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:10.661]  Good to be with you.
[01:33:11.784 --> 01:33:20.331]  Everything we feared, the martial law, the troops, there's now marines at checkpoints in the mainstream news helping look for drunk drivers as they acclimate us.
[01:33:20.331 --> 01:33:21.732]  There's so much to talk about.
[01:33:21.732 --> 01:33:23.454]  What should we get into first?
[01:33:23.454 --> 01:33:25.836]  Well, whatever's on your mind.
[01:33:25.836 --> 01:33:27.457]  Let's talk about the police state.
[01:33:27.457 --> 01:33:29.319]  Clearly they've been setting it up for a long time.
[01:33:29.319 --> 01:33:35.764]  We hoped Obama wouldn't continue with the whole operation, but it appears that's the direction he's going in.
[01:33:35.764 --> 01:33:39.387]  The trillion's missing, the economy.
[01:33:39.387 --> 01:33:40.388]  Where do you see it all going?
[01:33:42.425 --> 01:33:48.828]  Well, it's easiest for me to say something about the economy.
[01:33:48.828 --> 01:33:55.811]  I think in the new term, Alex, we're going to experience more deflation.
[01:33:55.811 --> 01:34:04.334]  In an effort to stem the deflation, there'll be a tremendous new creation of money and credit, particularly for the United States government, which
[01:34:05.362 --> 01:34:05.602]  This is
[01:34:36.045 --> 01:34:43.007]  But other than that, they'll have to monetize it.
[01:34:43.007 --> 01:34:47.869]  That is, the Federal Reserve will simply have to take the bonds and print money.
[01:34:47.869 --> 01:34:58.012]  I don't think the foreigners will lend it to them, because they'll see it as an enormous dilution of the existing holdings, which are massive.
[01:34:58.012 --> 01:35:04.394]  And most likely, the issuance of all this new debt will cause
[01:35:04.967 --> 01:35:05.127]  I'm good.
[01:35:11.098 --> 01:35:16.219]  I think I agree with John Williams that this is going to be a hyperinflationary depression.
[01:35:41.604 --> 01:35:47.708]  As I was leading into that, the initial stages are deflation, which is what we're seeing now.
[01:35:47.708 --> 01:35:50.850]  There'll be money and credit creation.
[01:35:50.850 --> 01:36:04.118]  There'll be pressure on the dollar in the exchange markets, and inflation will eventually result from all this money and credit, and there'll then be pressure on the dollar from the domestic inflation rate.
[01:36:04.118 --> 01:36:09.802]  And so, I just don't see how they can...
[01:36:10.876 --> 01:36:16.100]  Manage this with any traditional economic policy tools.
[01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:32.774]  So I think high unemployment and rising prices, and it will be worse than the Great Depression, because during the Great Depression, the high unemployment was accommodated in a sense with falling prices.
[01:36:32.774 --> 01:36:36.017]  But now we have people losing their jobs while prices rise.
[01:36:36.017 --> 01:36:37.138]  That's much harder to
[01:36:38.294 --> 01:36:39.115]  To deal with this.
[01:36:39.115 --> 01:36:40.976]  So, I think it's going to be very bad.
[01:36:40.976 --> 01:36:49.080]  It might be why they're deploying troops, since they expect that there will be a lot of dislocation of people.
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:56.645]  I mean, just look at the foreclosure rate on homes, on mortgages, and the amount of people who have already lost their homes.
[01:36:56.645 --> 01:37:00.667]  And then I know people that have jobs who are trying to get modest houses.
[01:37:00.667 --> 01:37:07.231]  There's all these empty houses sitting around, but the banks won't give them a loan for people that have jobs and money to even get a new house.
[01:37:08.513 --> 01:37:10.634]  Well, I don't know.
[01:37:10.634 --> 01:37:17.137]  That was true for a while, but I think they're willing to lend if you've got jobs and money.
[01:37:17.137 --> 01:37:35.464]  But the fact is that if you look at the current unemployment rate, and we measure it like it used to be measured, you know, 20 years ago by the government, before they monkeyed with the numbers, that we already have 15-16% unemployment.
[01:37:38.646 --> 01:37:41.569]  I mean, that's the current rate of unemployment.
[01:37:41.569 --> 01:37:43.691]  And this, I think, is just starting.
[01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:56.144]  There's a lot more to hit, you know, not just the subprime derivatives, but we've got all that credit card debt, we've got car loans, and all that.
[01:37:56.144 --> 01:37:57.385]  Home improvement loans.
[01:37:59.958 --> 01:38:01.679]  Business loans?
[01:38:01.679 --> 01:38:06.020]  Well, they've got the... I'm talking about the securitized stuff.
[01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:07.780]  Yeah, all the stuff they've been selling.
[01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:13.902]  So they've got credit card debt, they've got car loans, and they've got now, of course, the commercial loans.
[01:38:13.902 --> 01:38:16.042]  You know, all the shopping centers and stuff.
[01:38:16.042 --> 01:38:24.425]  Their stores and their shopping centers are closing, and so the rent to the owners of the shopping centers are down, and so they're going to be defaulting.
[01:38:24.425 --> 01:38:25.605]  So this is not going to be...
[01:38:26.477 --> 01:38:28.998]  It's just starting, I think.
[01:38:28.998 --> 01:38:34.740]  The Economist just came out, as you know, I'm sure, and said that we are in a depression, not a recession.
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:39.441]  And now we've got leaders of countries saying it's a worldwide depression beginning.
[01:38:39.441 --> 01:38:45.143]  So we went from there's no recession to now we're going into a depression.
[01:38:45.143 --> 01:38:48.904]  Looking at this, how do you see this unfolding?
[01:38:48.904 --> 01:38:50.665]  When will we hit the depths of it?
[01:38:50.665 --> 01:38:53.105]  And how bad will it be?
[01:38:53.105 --> 01:38:54.866]  Well, that requires a
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:39:03.946]  Crystal Ball, I don't think anything like this has ever happened before, certainly not in the United States.
[01:39:03.946 --> 01:39:08.270]  And so, I can't answer that.
[01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:21.441]  All I can say is that people are first going to be put through the wringer of deflation, declining asset values, and then the efforts they make to deal with that will set off the opposite.
[01:39:24.364 --> 01:39:25.345]  Rising inflation.
[01:39:25.345 --> 01:39:31.207]  It could easily reach hyperinflationary level.
[01:39:31.207 --> 01:39:36.029]  And no one really knows what to do, and there aren't really any solutions.
[01:39:36.029 --> 01:39:45.494]  You have to understand too, you see, the United States is now a heavily import-dependent country.
[01:39:45.494 --> 01:39:47.374]  We weren't during the Depression.
[01:39:47.374 --> 01:39:48.575]  We weren't dependent on imports.
[01:39:50.123 --> 01:39:54.746]  No, but we had no trade deficits.
[01:39:54.746 --> 01:40:00.569]  We didn't have to import energy and manufactured goods and advanced technology products and our shoes and our clothes.
[01:40:00.569 --> 01:40:03.791]  You see, now we're heavily dependent on imports.
[01:40:03.791 --> 01:40:09.314]  We have massive trade deficits and no way to pay for them, particularly if the dollar goes.
[01:40:09.314 --> 01:40:13.717]  So I think the potential here is far worse.
[01:40:15.162 --> 01:40:18.223]  I don't see any leadership in Washington.
[01:40:18.223 --> 01:40:28.747]  The first thing they did, as I'm sure you've emphasized many times, is they ran in and stole a trillion dollars from the taxpayers and gave it to the banksters.
[01:40:28.747 --> 01:40:34.989]  And so the first thing they did when they see a crisis is to take advantage of it to steal from us!
[01:40:34.989 --> 01:40:35.310]  More!
[01:40:37.031 --> 01:40:39.392]  To the banksters who caused the problem.
[01:40:39.392 --> 01:40:48.996]  So, you can see that with the kind of leadership we have, they're criminals, they're way... Anything that happens, they use it as an opportunity to steal more.
[01:40:48.996 --> 01:41:04.902]  And sir, as you know, Obama cheerleaded for the banker takeover bill called the bailout, and whereas people had hoped he would, at least it would be a recreation of Bush, it appears that he is going to accelerate the entire program, including the Middle East, confrontation with Russia, everything.
[01:41:05.262 --> 01:41:18.553]  Well, you know, Alex, what's going to put the quietus on their confrontation with Russia and their wars in Afghanistan and everywhere else is the fact they're not having any resources.
[01:41:18.553 --> 01:41:22.997]  See, all of that is financed by China and Japan and the Saudis.
[01:41:24.512 --> 01:41:28.135]  And why are they going to keep financing a sinking ship?
[01:41:28.135 --> 01:41:30.697]  I mean, we're talking about a ship that's going to sink big time.
[01:41:30.697 --> 01:41:32.018]  So you're saying it will sink.
[01:41:32.018 --> 01:41:34.900]  You're saying now we will have a mega-depression now.
[01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:37.522]  Because the last time we had you on, you said it was a possibility.
[01:41:37.522 --> 01:41:40.264]  In just a few months, you're now saying mega-depression.
[01:41:40.264 --> 01:41:42.126]  I don't see any way around it.
[01:41:42.126 --> 01:41:51.413]  Just ask yourself, how can they finance this current year's operating budget deficit of $2 trillion?
[01:41:54.025 --> 01:41:59.369]  That's at least five times larger than any deficit they've ever had to finance before.
[01:41:59.369 --> 01:42:01.691]  And they're in a much weaker position.
[01:42:01.691 --> 01:42:17.682]  But they're counting on the military to enforce the banker takeover of the Republic and a militarized police who are so arrogant now they shoot a guy on video in the back for no reason on the ground and aren't even going to indict the cop that did it and people are rioting in San Francisco.
[01:42:17.682 --> 01:42:20.164]  Yes, I think that the police are out of control.
[01:42:20.911 --> 01:42:21.492]  I think so.
[01:42:40.118 --> 01:42:40.979]  You've been on that.
[01:42:40.979 --> 01:42:41.639]  You know that.
[01:42:41.639 --> 01:42:43.040]  Boy, you're not mincing words now.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:48.302]  You're saying guaranteed mega-depression, 9-11's an inside job, not the evidence points towards it.
[01:42:48.302 --> 01:42:53.224]  Man, you're really, Dr. Roberts, coming right out and putting it all on the table.
[01:42:53.224 --> 01:42:55.185]  Well, I've never tried to hide anything.
[01:42:55.185 --> 01:42:58.747]  I just try to say what the evidence supports.
[01:42:58.747 --> 01:43:07.311]  I never believed 9-11 because I had engineering training at Georgia Tech, and I could tell when a building was being blown up by explosives.
[01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:12.083]  Any fool can look at those films and see that the buildings aren't falling down, they're blowing up.
[01:43:13.746 --> 01:43:16.168]  I know, and so we're in the Twilight Zone, Doctor!
[01:43:16.168 --> 01:43:19.910]  I mean, you're the father of Reaganomics, the big star with Ronald Reagan!
[01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:35.861]  I mean, you're so respected, and now here you are writing and talking about all this, and people in government are snickering and sucking their thumbs, while, as you said, wild criminals are running around stealing, and suddenly all these billionaires are hanging themselves, jumping in front of trains, they're clearly being killed.
[01:43:35.861 --> 01:43:39.163]  Madoff, he didn't steal 50 to 100 billion by himself.
[01:43:39.163 --> 01:43:41.505]  It turns out big banks knew and were involved with him.
[01:43:41.505 --> 01:43:42.105]  I mean, you're right.
[01:43:42.105 --> 01:43:43.626]  Can you speak about the Madoffs?
[01:43:43.846 --> 01:43:57.190]  Yeah, I just don't know enough about it, but it certainly does show the extent of total corruption.
[01:43:57.190 --> 01:43:59.350]  I mean, the man didn't need to do that.
[01:43:59.350 --> 01:44:01.871]  It wasn't like he was poor.
[01:44:01.871 --> 01:44:05.172]  And furthermore, nobody needs $50 billion.
[01:44:05.172 --> 01:44:07.112]  There's nothing you can do with $50 billion.
[01:44:07.112 --> 01:44:13.134]  It's a huge sum, and it's not large enough to create your own private army.
[01:44:13.632 --> 01:44:17.115]  To overthrow the United States, or China, or anything.
[01:44:17.115 --> 01:44:19.897]  But it's far larger than anybody could ever spend.
[01:44:19.897 --> 01:44:30.626]  But that's what Wall Street and the banksters have done, is they have stolen the pension funds, moved all this money into other assets, and they are overthrowing us.
[01:44:30.626 --> 01:44:34.169]  That's right, they're overthrowing our financial security.
[01:44:34.169 --> 01:44:35.911]  They've pretty much accomplished that.
[01:44:35.911 --> 01:44:38.313]  But aren't they burning down their own house in the process?
[01:44:43.467 --> 01:44:48.991]  It's sort of surprising that people haven't dragged them out in the street and hung them, actually.
[01:44:48.991 --> 01:44:52.053]  I mean, you know, a hundred years ago, what would have happened to them?
[01:44:52.053 --> 01:45:00.019]  I can't say I know, and we don't know what's going to happen yet.
[01:45:00.019 --> 01:45:05.643]  But, you know, we don't need to be so extreme in what we say.
[01:45:05.643 --> 01:45:10.887]  We can just ask the question, how are they going to finance a $2 trillion deficit?
[01:45:10.887 --> 01:45:12.128]  This is never done before.
[01:45:13.568 --> 01:45:19.152]  When I was in Treasury, if we'd had to finance a $2 trillion deficit, we wouldn't know what to do.
[01:45:19.152 --> 01:45:28.420]  And, of course, the economy then was far stronger, and we didn't have massive trade deficits.
[01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:31.603]  We hadn't offshored all the good jobs.
[01:45:32.150 --> 01:45:33.891]  So how do you see this unraveling then?
[01:45:33.891 --> 01:45:38.453]  Because I've got several mainstream articles here today.
[01:45:38.453 --> 01:45:39.014]  Here's one.
[01:45:39.014 --> 01:45:39.274]  U.S.
[01:45:39.274 --> 01:45:42.215]  companies face $409 million pension deficit.
[01:45:42.215 --> 01:45:49.779]  But then you read the number that the pensions in the end of 2007 were $1.66 trillion.
[01:45:49.779 --> 01:45:53.401]  But now the liabilities are $1.6 trillion.
[01:45:53.401 --> 01:45:55.562]  So it says there's only $6 billion left.
[01:45:55.562 --> 01:45:57.123]  This is Reuters.
[01:45:57.123 --> 01:45:57.883]  Here's another one.
[01:45:59.204 --> 01:46:00.965]  International Herald Tribune, U.S.
[01:46:00.965 --> 01:46:07.147]  debt is losing appeal in China, and it sources major Chinese papers saying they may just completely stop buying U.S.
[01:46:07.147 --> 01:46:08.467]  debt.
[01:46:08.467 --> 01:46:10.828]  Well, I suspect they will.
[01:46:10.828 --> 01:46:13.829]  And, as I said, I've already, you know, we've already covered that.
[01:46:13.829 --> 01:46:20.871]  When people see, you know, our creditors are foreigners, because the American saving rate is zero.
[01:46:20.871 --> 01:46:21.191]  Negative.
[01:46:22.404 --> 01:46:30.689]  It may be negative, but the point is, we don't have any money to finance our deficit, so we have to rely on foreigners.
[01:46:30.689 --> 01:46:48.840]  Now, I did say it's possible that this deficit can be financed by the American flight from stocks and money market funds and bank CDs, because there may be further crises from the credit card debt and all the rest that cause them, again, to lose confidence.
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:50.541]  And so people may buy the Treasuries.
[01:46:51.423 --> 01:46:55.505]  It's the only place they think they can put the money other than in their mattress.
[01:46:55.505 --> 01:46:56.905]  Even though they get no return?
[01:46:56.905 --> 01:46:58.025]  Even though they get no return.
[01:46:58.025 --> 01:47:02.707]  They may do that, and that may finance it.
[01:47:02.707 --> 01:47:13.671]  Nevertheless, even if that does finance it, the foreigners are going to see, hey look, there's two trillion more in treasury bonds that are out.
[01:47:13.671 --> 01:47:17.512]  What has that done to the value of mine?
[01:47:17.512 --> 01:47:18.813]  Should I be holding these things?
[01:47:19.545 --> 01:47:25.908]  And then if they start lightening up the existing holdings, not only will they not buy anymore, they'd start selling what they got.
[01:47:25.908 --> 01:47:28.289]  Then all that comes into the market.
[01:47:28.289 --> 01:47:30.290]  Who takes that up?
[01:47:30.290 --> 01:47:33.731]  And the Fed would have to monetize it.
[01:47:33.731 --> 01:47:35.252]  They'd just have to create the money.
[01:47:35.252 --> 01:47:41.354]  So you're saying no way out, any way you cut it, they can only extend out the total collapse and make it worse when it does happen?
[01:47:41.354 --> 01:47:44.155]  Well, I can't see how they can get out of that.
[01:47:44.155 --> 01:47:45.616]  Whatever they do, it looks to me,
[01:47:46.298 --> 01:48:04.589]  Either going to put pressure on the dollar's exchange value, driving it down, or it's going to cause more inflation, driving the value of the dollar down, or it's going to erode the government's credit standing.
[01:48:04.589 --> 01:48:11.753]  There's nothing they can do that's not going to do one of those three things, and perhaps all of them, that I can think of.
[01:48:12.788 --> 01:48:18.591]  Maybe some brilliant person will show up and they'll come up with some new scheme.
[01:48:18.591 --> 01:48:34.198]  But you know, Alex, the problem is that the debt has so greatly outpaced the growth of real income that there's just not enough income there to support the debt.
[01:48:34.198 --> 01:48:41.062]  Generally, Alex, when that happens, they get rid of it by inflating away the debt.
[01:48:42.304 --> 01:48:46.568]  So, that is the most likely outcome.
[01:48:46.568 --> 01:48:47.729]  Well, Obama said that today.
[01:48:47.729 --> 01:48:49.290]  He said they're going to print money.
[01:48:49.290 --> 01:48:50.531]  That's the headline on Drudge.
[01:48:50.531 --> 01:48:52.253]  Wow!
[01:48:52.253 --> 01:48:53.434]  How do we protect ourselves?
[01:48:53.434 --> 01:48:57.418]  We'll talk to Dr. Roberts on the other side in the final short segment with him.
[01:48:57.418 --> 01:48:59.740]  He's got his book out, his new book out.
[01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:01.521]  It's second edition, updated.
[01:49:01.521 --> 01:49:03.443]  The Tyranny of Good Intentions.
[01:49:07.230 --> 01:49:12.593]  Well, it gets into just the incredible corruption of the courts and the whole system.
[01:49:12.593 --> 01:49:14.795]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's no way to polish this thing.
[01:49:14.795 --> 01:49:16.096]  It is what it is, a big turd.
[01:49:19.216 --> 01:49:22.917]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:49:22.917 --> 01:49:28.659]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:49:28.659 --> 01:49:32.980]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:49:32.980 --> 01:49:35.441]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:49:35.441 --> 01:49:41.323]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[01:49:41.323 --> 01:49:42.043]  We're good to go!
[01:50:12.379 --> 01:50:16.342]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:50:16.342 --> 01:50:23.746]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:50:23.746 --> 01:50:26.408]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:50:26.408 --> 01:50:27.588]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:50:27.588 --> 01:50:29.309]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:50:29.309 --> 01:50:32.191]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:50:32.191 --> 01:50:35.813]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:50:45.462 --> 01:50:51.607]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:50:51.607 --> 01:50:52.728]  An inside job.
[01:50:54.133 --> 01:50:55.614]  How dare you?
[01:50:55.614 --> 01:51:01.657]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:51:01.657 --> 01:51:04.539]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:51:04.539 --> 01:51:11.002]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:51:11.002 --> 01:51:13.863]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.

[01:51:16.105 --> 01:51:18.586]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:51:19.151 --> 01:51:22.674]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[01:51:22.674 --> 01:51:24.596]  Now, going green can save money.
[01:51:24.596 --> 01:51:30.160]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:38.187]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[01:51:38.187 --> 01:51:44.872]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical
[01:51:44.932 --> 01:51:45.333]  I think so.
[01:52:01.696 --> 01:52:02.817]  Save your money.
[01:52:02.817 --> 01:52:04.118]  Save the environment.

[01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:09.361]  That's r-charge.com.
[01:52:09.361 --> 01:52:10.142]  Or call us at 989-637-4179.
[01:52:10.142 --> 01:52:10.622]  That's 989-637-4179.
[01:52:10.622 --> 01:52:11.923]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[01:52:30.529 --> 01:52:33.591]  I wish a buck was still silver.
[01:52:33.591 --> 01:52:39.636]  It was back when the country was strong.
[01:52:39.636 --> 01:52:45.701]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts in closing in the five minutes we have left here in this first New Year's show I've done with you.
[01:52:49.833 --> 01:52:53.695]  Any ways to turn this around, or if you were in government, what would you do?
[01:52:53.695 --> 01:53:02.201]  Briefly, and then a comment on the Gaza situation now expanding into southern Lebanon.
[01:53:02.201 --> 01:53:07.084]  You may know the Bank of England is the British version of the Federal Reserve.
[01:53:07.084 --> 01:53:14.929]  And one of their former governors announced two days ago, this is reported in the London Telegraph, this is the quote, the long-held assumption
[01:53:15.424 --> 01:53:16.325]  We're good to go.
[01:53:45.737 --> 01:53:51.339]  First, try to reassure the world that the dollar still had a chance to be the reserve currency.
[01:53:51.339 --> 01:53:56.622]  I would do that by attacking the budget deficit and the trade deficit.
[01:53:56.622 --> 01:54:08.347]  I would attack the budget deficit by instantly stopping these expensive wars that we cannot afford, by slashing the massive defense budget, which is larger than the rest of the world combined,
[01:54:08.948 --> 01:54:11.630]  And has no practical purpose.
[01:54:11.630 --> 01:54:15.733]  We cannot establish American hegemony over the world.
[01:54:15.733 --> 01:54:25.299]  I would slash that and therefore I would get the damn budget deficit down by a half a trillion dollars.
[01:54:25.299 --> 01:54:29.802]  And then I would impose a new form of taxes on corporations.
[01:54:29.802 --> 01:54:38.168]  I would abolish income tax and I would tax them according to how much of the value added of their products occurred in the United States.
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:43.604]  If they make their goods that they sell to us here, they have a very low tax rate.
[01:54:43.604 --> 01:54:48.007]  If they make them in China or Indonesia or somewhere else, they have a very high tax rate.
[01:54:48.007 --> 01:54:51.550]  And so that would tend to bring the jobs back to America.
[01:54:51.550 --> 01:54:57.676]  So an internal tariff, an internal tariff to incentivize domestic development.
[01:54:57.676 --> 01:55:04.021]  Yeah, it's not a tariff, it's a way of taxing the corporations that offsets or eliminates
[01:55:04.676 --> 01:55:07.377]  Their incentive to chase cheap labor abroad.
[01:55:07.377 --> 01:55:08.317]  And look at the opposite!
[01:55:08.317 --> 01:55:21.822]  Look at globalization with China with all the slave goods and... So, now, that's... And, if this was believable, then the world might say, okay, these fools are finally going to take the necessary steps.
[01:55:21.822 --> 01:55:23.302]  They'll get their house back in order.
[01:55:23.302 --> 01:55:25.243]  We'll stick with them.
[01:55:25.243 --> 01:55:33.486]  But if instead all we do is run up more debt and continue these wars, which they're going to stop financing sooner or later,
[01:55:34.807 --> 01:55:38.909]  We're going to have this dollar collapse, in which case... It's over.
[01:55:38.909 --> 01:55:39.350]  It's over.
[01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:43.652]  There's no way out if that happens.
[01:55:43.652 --> 01:55:46.313]  Now, what's going on in Palestine?
[01:55:46.313 --> 01:55:49.695]  So many people have said this is genocide.
[01:55:49.695 --> 01:55:53.957]  This is the destruction of a people.
[01:55:53.957 --> 01:55:56.158]  It's been going on for 60 years.
[01:55:56.158 --> 01:56:02.802]  The Israelis have gotten away with their lies and their violence and their war crimes for 60 years, and they'll continue.
[01:56:05.006 --> 01:56:26.539]  That the NBC Anchorwoman and Foreign Affairs Correspondent, Andrea Mitchell, said on Sunday that we have American soldiers from the Corps of Engineers stationed on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing, helping close the tunnels.
[01:56:26.539 --> 01:56:27.279]  Yes.
[01:56:27.279 --> 01:56:31.162]  So we are involved in it directly now.
[01:56:31.162 --> 01:56:32.703]  It's not just that we gave them permission.
[01:56:33.755 --> 01:56:36.836]  We got our guys over there helping them.
[01:56:36.836 --> 01:56:48.521]  So, if you look to the extent that there's moral passion left in the world, we're going to be hated, just like the Israelis.
[01:56:48.521 --> 01:56:50.842]  Alright, so they will be happy when we collapse, Dr. Roberts.
[01:56:50.842 --> 01:56:53.123]  And they'll be happy when we collapse.
[01:56:53.123 --> 01:56:54.964]  Thank you for all your time, sir.
[01:56:54.964 --> 01:56:55.864]  You're welcome, Alex.
[01:56:55.864 --> 01:56:56.865]  Good to be with you.
[01:56:56.865 --> 01:57:01.286]  Take care.
[01:57:01.286 --> 01:57:02.427]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:03.786 --> 01:57:06.088]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:18.852 --> 01:57:20.214]  Who is the enemy?
[01:57:20.214 --> 01:57:21.015]  Bin Laden.
[01:57:21.015 --> 01:57:21.996]  This is his ammo.
[01:57:21.996 --> 01:57:23.378]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:57:23.378 --> 01:57:25.380]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:32.528]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:57:32.528 --> 01:57:33.009]  Some U.S.
[01:57:33.009 --> 01:57:38.656]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:57:39.336 --> 01:57:42.837]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:57:42.837 --> 01:57:45.658]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:58:11.696 --> 01:58:14.097]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:58:14.097 --> 01:58:23.500]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:24.800]  Big Brother.
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:26.581]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:26.581 --> 01:58:28.341]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:28.341 --> 01:58:29.902]  You want answers?
[01:58:29.902 --> 01:58:30.862]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:30.862 --> 01:58:35.664]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:35.664 --> 01:58:39.725]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:47.111]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:47.111 --> 01:58:47.511]  Welcome.
[01:58:47.511 --> 01:59:06.243]  We're going to be live for the next two hours at PrisonPlanet.tv, simulcasting this Thursday, January 8, 2009 edition, this attempt to awaken the world population to the overarching world psychological dictatorship that's run by the New World Order.
[01:59:07.063 --> 01:59:27.432]  For the next hour and a half, we're honored to be joined by one of the most sought-after speakers on radio and in person, filmmaker, best-selling author, David Icke, also championship goalie in his own right, of course, BBC News presenter before his startling Saul on the road to Damascus transformation.
[01:59:28.519 --> 01:59:31.942]  Literally being knocked off his horse with a revelation.
[01:59:31.942 --> 01:59:46.753]  And in the last 15, 16, 17 years, he has spoken to millions of people around the world and we're honored to have him again for the next hour and a half to talk about the current world economic crisis being engineered and how this is really going to force an even faster awakening to this tyranny.
[01:59:46.753 --> 01:59:51.997]  So, David Icke, it is great to have you joining us here from England.
[01:59:51.997 --> 01:59:54.319]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:59:54.319 --> 01:59:58.082]  This is a short segment, but what are some of the things you want to discuss and go over today?
[01:59:59.505 --> 02:00:28.233]  Well certainly we talk about the financial situation because you know for me what we're looking at is a similar situation to when they have a controlled demolition of a building and the charges go off and you see the flashes and then extraordinarily there's that split second when nothing seems to happen and then the whole thing crashes and for me where we are in this economic engineered collapse is in that split second before the whole thing starts to collapse and you know when you think
[02:00:28.934 --> 02:00:29.854]  We're good to go!
[02:00:51.551 --> 02:00:52.212]  You're right.
[02:01:17.122 --> 02:01:21.494]  In the time we have left in this first segment, I want to get your response since last time we had you on to...
[02:01:23.601 --> 02:01:26.121]  It's got to be more than 400 articles I've seen.
[02:01:26.121 --> 02:01:37.463]  If you Google the term New World Order and put it into the news section, not web, but news, the last time I checked it was 4,600 news articles, but I only, over the last few months, have read, I know it's more than 300.
[02:01:37.463 --> 02:01:40.464]  It's 10 or 15 a day, I'd see without looking.
[02:01:40.464 --> 02:01:51.146]  Financial Times of London, Wall Street Journal, Der Spiegel, all the major publications of record of the establishment, the Bilderberg run, their editor-in-chief, of course, is Bilderberg, Mr. Wolf,
[02:01:51.846 --> 02:02:08.272]  Times of London, Financial Times, saying, and now for world government, and they say, we set it up in secret, it's for your own good, we'll save you from the financial collapse when they engineered it, and they go on to say that we're going to pay carbon taxes on all our activities to them.
[02:02:08.272 --> 02:02:12.073]  So Kissinger came out this week and said we need to use this crisis for a new
[02:02:12.373 --> 02:02:21.199]  No, there was always a time when what they were doing covertly had to break the surface because they want to change society in the image that they want to change society.
[02:02:21.199 --> 02:02:24.521]  So we have to eventually see it in our face and that's what we're seeing.
[02:02:24.521 --> 02:02:27.723]  And of course, you know, those of us like you and me and many others who've been
[02:02:42.208 --> 02:02:42.829]  I think so.
[02:02:56.633 --> 02:03:01.138]  ...the infrastructure we've been predicting all this time, including the World Central Bank.
[02:03:01.138 --> 02:03:03.801]  They've not used that word yet, that term yet, but they will.
[02:03:03.801 --> 02:03:05.884]  They're talking about... Actually, they have, David.
[02:03:05.884 --> 02:03:06.945]  ...architecture.
[02:03:06.945 --> 02:03:08.987]  Actually, they have mentioned the new World Central Bank.
[02:03:08.987 --> 02:03:10.048]  You may have missed it.
[02:03:10.048 --> 02:03:10.589]  Stay there.
[02:03:10.589 --> 02:03:14.774]  David Icke, we'll be back after this quick break to go over all of this.
[02:03:14.774 --> 02:03:15.695]  Please stay with us.
[02:03:19.485 --> 02:03:21.168]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:03:21.168 --> 02:03:25.915]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:03:25.915 --> 02:03:28.879]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:03:28.879 --> 02:03:31.924]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:03:31.924 --> 02:03:35.549]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[02:03:35.709 --> 02:03:43.837]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[02:03:43.837 --> 02:03:45.678]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[02:03:45.678 --> 02:03:49.642]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[02:03:49.642 --> 02:03:52.465]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[02:03:52.465 --> 02:04:01.273]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[02:04:01.593 --> 02:04:08.676]  In pre-Nazi Germany superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days, until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[02:04:08.676 --> 02:04:13.137]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[02:04:13.137 --> 02:04:18.820]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:22.081]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[02:04:22.081 --> 02:04:25.202]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[02:04:25.422 --> 02:04:27.244]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[02:04:27.244 --> 02:04:31.308]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[02:04:31.308 --> 02:04:35.432]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[02:04:35.432 --> 02:04:42.979]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[02:04:42.979 --> 02:04:46.923]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[02:04:46.923 --> 02:04:49.786]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:04:50.146 --> 02:04:57.128]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:04:57.128 --> 02:05:00.409]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[02:05:28.598 --> 02:05:34.120]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:37.853 --> 02:05:49.737]  We are live, blasting out on the AM and FM dials, simulcasting on global shortwave, the internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:05:49.737 --> 02:05:55.619]  Don't forget the free podcast you can go sign up for, for free at InfoWars.com on the listen page.
[02:05:55.619 --> 02:05:56.739]  Okay, David Icke.
[02:05:57.459 --> 02:06:06.121]  Continuing, for more than 15 years you've talked about how the private financial banks would engineer a crisis and then out of that bring in their world government.
[02:06:06.121 --> 02:06:17.583]  They have said, as we were getting to before we went to break, at the G20 Summit, a new world financial system with a world financial bank where you will pay your carbon credits directly to them.
[02:06:17.583 --> 02:06:21.044]  I remember seeing that in the Financial Times of London and other places.
[02:06:21.044 --> 02:06:23.084]  They are now moving us towards that.
[02:06:23.764 --> 02:06:27.828]  It looks like their system's imploding and that, you know, they're laying off all these financial workers.
[02:06:27.828 --> 02:06:31.012]  That's because they don't need the little bees to gather people's investments.
[02:06:31.012 --> 02:06:32.974]  They're now stealing the pension funds.
[02:06:32.974 --> 02:06:41.622]  We're now, the West is in negative savings, so they need to destroy the old system to build their new system, problem, reaction, solution.
[02:06:41.622 --> 02:06:43.164]  Break that down for us, David Icke.
[02:06:43.726 --> 02:06:59.557]  Yeah, they're talking in Europe, people like Sarkozy and Gordon Brown, about a new global financial architecture which is all, of course, all well speak for this centralized financial system that will dictate the whole of global finance from a central point.
[02:06:59.557 --> 02:07:03.079]  This is what they've been working towards and it's important to stress that
[02:07:04.242 --> 02:07:08.725]  You know, when people see the banking system collapsing, they think it's bad for the bankers.
[02:07:08.725 --> 02:07:12.207]  Well, it's bad for the bankers who lose their jobs, like you say, the bees.
[02:07:12.207 --> 02:07:14.668]  But it's not bad for the people who own the system.
[02:07:14.668 --> 02:07:16.109]  And this is the point.
[02:07:16.109 --> 02:07:19.231]  The families that we're talking about own the system.
[02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:28.777]  So if they owned the National Football League, they couldn't care less if one team beats this team or that team beats another team, because they own the game.
[02:07:28.777 --> 02:07:29.978]  They can't lose.
[02:07:29.978 --> 02:07:33.660]  So when this bank goes down or that bank goes down or this bank's absorbed by this bank,
[02:07:34.346 --> 02:07:35.487]  It doesn't matter to them.
[02:07:35.487 --> 02:07:39.670]  What it means is there's just fewer names on the doors to deal with.
[02:07:39.670 --> 02:07:55.601]  They own the game, and they're changing the game now to increase the amount of centralized global control that will, by definition, increase dramatically the amount of control over the global population, which is what money's about.
[02:07:55.601 --> 02:08:01.966]  Money's a vehicle for control, for suppressing potential, for suppressing choice, for forcing people
[02:08:02.666 --> 02:08:12.490]  Into doing things they don't really want to do because they have to raise the money to pay the essential bills To the corporations that are owned by the same people that are screwing them financially.
[02:08:12.490 --> 02:08:30.338]  So we're reaching a point now where We've gone so far along this road while people have been watching game shows and watching the soaps and the football And now it's it's peaked its head into the public arena where it's in our face and people are going where did this come from?
[02:08:30.338 --> 02:08:31.779]  Well, it's come from decades of
[02:08:32.319 --> 02:08:36.261]  And decades, indeed, hundreds of years of manipulation to get us to this point.
[02:08:36.261 --> 02:08:50.226]  And it's a point of great challenge and great danger in terms of freedom, but it's also a point of great opportunity, because you can ignore something when crazy people like me are going, it's coming.
[02:08:50.226 --> 02:08:54.828]  And you're, oh no, he's just mad, he believes in reptiles, he's mad and all this stuff.
[02:08:54.828 --> 02:08:59.050]  But when it's in your face and it's in your daily life, you can't look away anymore.
[02:08:59.050 --> 02:09:01.111]  And I'm sure you're finding the same, Alex, that
[02:09:02.029 --> 02:09:07.512]  More and more people who were ignoring it before are now going, hold on a second, what can we do about this?
[02:09:07.512 --> 02:09:21.580]  So we're moving into a stage where we can actually, those that are challenging this tyranny, this global fascism, where we can actually go to a stage of starting to do something about it rather than just talk about it.
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:28.887]  Okay, David, while you were talking, I went into Google and Googled World Central Bank and found hundreds of articles.
[02:09:28.887 --> 02:09:35.673]  Here is Newsweek, why we need a bank of the world, the financial crisis is global and only international central bank can deal with it.
[02:09:35.673 --> 02:09:43.741]  Now, already under the IMF, World Bank, Ex-Im Bank, in their own documents they admit they already are the World Central Bank, but under this they will set interest rates globally.
[02:09:44.581 --> 02:09:46.542]  They will selectively control nations.
[02:09:46.542 --> 02:09:48.883]  They will decide how much currency can be issued.
[02:09:48.883 --> 02:09:51.944]  You'll still have your currencies of the world in their own words.
[02:09:51.944 --> 02:09:54.365]  It will just all be regulated and controlled by them.
[02:09:54.365 --> 02:09:57.186]  Kind of like the national ID card in the US.
[02:09:57.186 --> 02:10:01.848]  It's the states administering it, but the feds set it up and control the computer systems.
[02:10:01.848 --> 02:10:08.751]  So it's really a national ID card tied into a world ID database, but the public thinks it's a driver's license when it's really the real ID.
[02:10:08.751 --> 02:10:09.851]  But there is Newsweek
[02:10:10.231 --> 02:10:24.142]  For anyone that doubts this, and I could sit here showing people hundreds of these where they are saying not just that they're setting up a World Central Bank, but that you will pay your taxes on every activity you are involved in on your carbon footprint to them.
[02:10:25.339 --> 02:10:45.673]  Yeah, and the idea is to eventually get rid of all currencies for a simple reason, that at the moment if you go into a store or you want to buy something anywhere and you give them electronic money and the computer says no to your credit card, then at least still, just, just, you have the opportunity to say, well I'll pay cash then.
[02:10:46.253 --> 02:10:46.573]  I think so.
[02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:03.860]  And that's already happening.
[02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:11.982]  You know, we never shop at Walmart here at this office, but I said, hurry up and get me a TiVo so I can record things off TV here at the new office.
[02:11:11.982 --> 02:11:14.503]  And the guys went to Walmart without asking me.
[02:11:14.503 --> 02:11:15.963]  I don't micromanage them.
[02:11:15.963 --> 02:11:22.825]  And my guy called, and because he had a debt, not an unpaid check, but because he had a debt
[02:11:23.405 --> 02:11:23.765]  That's right.
[02:11:54.059 --> 02:11:55.620]  Yeah, and this is happening everywhere.
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:12:01.363]  I mean, in Britain, the Big Brother state is hurtling forward.
[02:12:01.363 --> 02:12:10.188]  And in terms of the economic situation here, I mean, it's not really reached the point that it's going to reach as we were talking about earlier.
[02:12:10.188 --> 02:12:22.755]  But when I go around the shops, which I occasionally do, not very often, or you go into a pub or a restaurant or something, places are empty where I go, where they never were before.
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:35.903]  And so, you know, we're on the brink of a massive economic situation here globally, and it's been deliberately engineered for the ends that we're talking about.
[02:12:35.903 --> 02:12:40.084]  David, how do we get the word out to the people?
[02:12:40.084 --> 02:12:44.165]  And as you said, our credibility is sore because everything we predicted is now unfolding, unfortunately.
[02:12:44.165 --> 02:12:45.465]  I wish we were wrong.
[02:12:45.465 --> 02:12:51.887]  How do, what are the most, because you're very effective at unlocking minds in your educated opinion, your informed opinion,
[02:12:52.887 --> 02:12:54.147]  From experience.
[02:12:54.147 --> 02:12:56.928]  How do we reach out to them and say, look, it's now here.
[02:12:56.928 --> 02:13:05.131]  We're not warning you about something coming and all the preparatory phase that was bad enough setting up this tyrannical, dehumanizing, soul-stealing grid.
[02:13:05.131 --> 02:13:14.234]  We're now entering in to the long slide into the depths of global mass extermination, population reduction, because we're not making even predictions.
[02:13:14.234 --> 02:13:15.895]  We're following their own documents.
[02:13:15.895 --> 02:13:17.435]  We know where it goes.
[02:13:17.435 --> 02:13:22.277]  Can the public face the horror of what's going to happen if they keep living in la-la land?
[02:13:23.499 --> 02:13:31.384]  Well, what I say to people is, you know, if you think you don't like the situation now, then think what you're going to face a little way down the road.
[02:13:31.384 --> 02:13:34.867]  And more than anything, think of what your children are going to have to face.
[02:13:34.867 --> 02:13:40.450]  Because you think if we live in a controlled society now, this is nothing compared with what they are going to have to live in.
[02:13:40.450 --> 02:13:48.796]  So in terms of parents who are listening to this information, I would say this, go and look your children in the eyes and tell them
[02:13:49.246 --> 02:13:52.530]  That you can't be bothered or you're too frightened to do anything about it.
[02:13:52.530 --> 02:13:54.132]  You're too frightened to get involved.
[02:13:54.132 --> 02:14:03.483]  Too frightened to get involved in being another conduit for getting this information further and further expanded into the public mind.
[02:14:03.483 --> 02:14:08.950]  That you're too frightened to get together with others to stop cooperating with this system.
[02:14:09.517 --> 02:14:10.818]  I don't think so.
[02:14:35.247 --> 02:14:37.128]  Let us see where the real power is here.
[02:14:37.128 --> 02:14:44.390]  There are billions of people, six billion, nearly getting on for seven billion on this planet, who are being manipulated.
[02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:53.394]  There are, in full knowledge of what they're doing, a relative handful of those who are doing the manipulating to the end that we're talking about.
[02:14:53.394 --> 02:15:02.377]  Because of the compartmentalized pyramids that they've constructed within all these institutions of government and finance and corporations,
[02:15:03.084 --> 02:15:19.489]  The vast majority of people who are daily making contributions to push the world towards this Orwellian global state have no idea that they're doing that because they don't know how their contributions fit in with everyone else's, only the few at the top do.
[02:15:19.489 --> 02:15:24.371]  And what we need to start doing is realizing that we've reached the fork in the road.
[02:15:25.024 --> 02:15:25.424]  I don't know.
[02:15:47.893 --> 02:15:55.458]  And you look and face the situation, a tornado's coming, you can now take action to avoid the consequences.
[02:15:55.458 --> 02:15:56.038]  Exactly.
[02:15:56.038 --> 02:15:57.719]  That's where we're looking at now.
[02:15:57.719 --> 02:16:10.908]  We need to grow up, start being adults, look at the future our children are going to have unless we do something, and get off the backsides, you know, disconnect them from the sofa and let's get this sorted.
[02:16:12.108 --> 02:16:12.768]  Well, absolutely.
[02:16:12.768 --> 02:16:16.769]  We're going to go to break and come back and get more into this mass awakening.
[02:16:16.769 --> 02:16:19.310]  And I want your take on this after the break, David.
[02:16:19.310 --> 02:16:33.613]  People love to say, oh, look at those stupid Jews, or those stupid gypsies, or those stupid Anglicans who didn't like Hitler, and they just went on trains, and they went to camps, and they stripped down naked, and they got run into pits and gunned down.
[02:16:33.613 --> 02:16:34.693]  Why didn't they fight back?
[02:16:34.693 --> 02:16:37.554]  And we see those Nazi film footage of that.
[02:16:38.334 --> 02:16:42.837]  When that was done incrementally, we're going to come back and get your analysis on this, that was done incrementally.
[02:16:42.837 --> 02:16:50.601]  They were slowly trained to live in ghettos and then to wear yellow stars or pink triangles or whatever the case was.
[02:16:50.601 --> 02:17:01.608]  They were slowly trained by incremental steps to put up with more and more until, well now we're taking you here to a camp to be safe because the public's beating you up and smashing your store windows.
[02:17:02.348 --> 02:17:06.070]  And, you know, now just take your clothes off over here.
[02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:07.250]  We're going to take care of you.
[02:17:07.250 --> 02:17:13.913]  And then they would line up and see the people being shot in front of them, but they would still just run into the pit obediently to their deaths.
[02:17:13.913 --> 02:17:15.093]  That is mind control.
[02:17:15.093 --> 02:17:16.494]  That is incremental conditioning.
[02:17:16.494 --> 02:17:20.596]  And we're going into the same thing as the ambient tyranny is turned up.
[02:17:20.596 --> 02:17:24.657]  We have to learn to recognize that, to stop it now, and break our conditioning.
[02:17:24.657 --> 02:17:25.778]  Stay with us with David Icke.
[02:17:28.542 --> 02:17:40.255]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash.

[02:18:20.062 --> 02:18:22.883]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[02:18:22.883 --> 02:18:34.247]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:18:34.247 --> 02:18:35.888]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:18:37.060 --> 02:18:38.422]  Who is the enemy?
[02:18:38.422 --> 02:18:39.222]  Bin Laden.
[02:18:39.222 --> 02:18:40.243]  This is his M.O.
[02:18:40.243 --> 02:18:41.584]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:18:41.584 --> 02:18:43.586]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:18:43.586 --> 02:18:50.733]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:18:50.733 --> 02:18:51.213]  Some U.S.
[02:18:51.213 --> 02:18:56.879]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:18:57.559 --> 02:19:01.060]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:03.861]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:19:28.001 --> 02:19:30.222]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[02:19:30.222 --> 02:19:33.163]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[02:19:33.163 --> 02:19:41.767]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[02:19:41.767 --> 02:19:45.429]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[02:19:45.429 --> 02:19:49.971]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[02:19:49.971 --> 02:19:51.572]  How much are you willing to lose?
[02:19:51.952 --> 02:19:53.013]  Take action now!
[02:19:53.013 --> 02:19:57.818]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[02:19:57.818 --> 02:20:01.821]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[02:20:01.821 --> 02:20:05.144]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[02:20:05.144 --> 02:20:11.570]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.

[02:20:29.162 --> 02:20:34.925]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[02:20:34.925 --> 02:20:37.207]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[02:20:37.207 --> 02:20:39.328]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[02:20:39.328 --> 02:20:40.589]  Everyone needs something to get

[02:21:34.677 --> 02:21:54.666]  If you don't think the global architects running the western world and the planet won't kill you, won't enslave you, won't rob your pension funds blind, it's happening.
[02:21:54.666 --> 02:22:01.529]  Just yesterday I saw several mainstream news articles admitting that British SAS trained Pol Pot's people to kill between three and four million.
[02:22:04.192 --> 02:22:04.912]  Why did they do this?
[02:22:04.912 --> 02:22:06.233]  We'll talk more about that with David.
[02:22:06.233 --> 02:22:15.336]  David, I went into the mass mind control of people in Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, over and over again, who will just march in and be mowed down and killed.
[02:22:15.336 --> 02:22:18.737]  Why did the founders of this country, why would they not go along with that?
[02:22:18.737 --> 02:22:19.878]  Why did they fight back?
[02:22:19.878 --> 02:22:20.698]  What's the difference?
[02:22:20.698 --> 02:22:31.382]  How do we get people to psychologically realize how they're being trained to have this learned helplessness, where they just lay down to the men in black uniforms?
[02:22:31.382 --> 02:22:33.003]  Well, when you're talking about mass mind control,
[02:22:34.573 --> 02:22:38.019]  We can't go any further than Barack Obama because America has just had...
[02:22:39.346 --> 02:22:52.393]  visited upon it, a massive mass mind control operation to get him to power and to build his ludicrous, ludicrous myth of a personality and an image that so many people have bought.
[02:22:52.393 --> 02:23:06.680]  And I don't know about you, Alex, but I tell you, I've shaken my head a few times in the last few months when I've seen people who I thought had got it to an extent, who had bought the Obama myth as if somehow here out of nowhere is a change to the
[02:23:08.841 --> 02:23:11.583]  The system as it works in terms of creating precedence.
[02:23:11.583 --> 02:23:19.066]  Well, to answer your question, I mean, what I think of it, they know things are bad and they want to believe a fairy tale.
[02:23:19.066 --> 02:23:21.107]  They want to think the nightmare is over.
[02:23:21.107 --> 02:23:31.973]  It's exactly because they are somewhat awake that they're so afraid now at the reality that they are grasping at straws, you know, seeing things, mirages in the desert.
[02:23:31.973 --> 02:23:35.755]  A man dying of thirst will, you know, see huge lakes of cool, clean
[02:23:36.275 --> 02:23:41.496]  Uh, water to go drink, and we'll even go crazy and think he's drinking water when he's throwing sand into his mouth.
[02:23:41.496 --> 02:23:48.018]  And you've written a great, uh, analysis breaking down the mass mind control, the real programs, uh, of Barack Obama.
[02:23:48.018 --> 02:23:50.658]  Uh, we link to it at InfoWars.com, DavidIke.com.
[02:23:50.658 --> 02:23:51.578]  What's the article?
[02:23:51.578 --> 02:23:53.379]  Uh, The Emperor With No Clothes?
[02:23:53.379 --> 02:23:55.459]  It's, uh, Barack Obama, the naked emperor.
[02:23:55.459 --> 02:24:00.540]  You, you, you've introduced a very, very important, uh, point, Alex, in terms of mass mind control.
[02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:04.041]  It's the principle of the target wanting it to be true.
[02:24:04.822 --> 02:24:13.812]  And in many ways, the worse it gets, the more people can be enticed into following someone who's telling them what they want to be true.
[02:24:13.812 --> 02:24:25.085]  I mean, if you take what happened in Nazi Germany and those other examples you gave, at each point, people don't want to face the fact of the situation they're in.
[02:24:25.689 --> 02:24:29.191]  So they will believe when someone tells them, no, no, it's not that.
[02:24:29.191 --> 02:24:30.892]  Just do it for this reason.
[02:24:30.892 --> 02:24:32.253]  They want that to be true.
[02:24:32.253 --> 02:24:35.714]  And that's the most powerful form of control.
[02:24:35.714 --> 02:24:36.655]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:24:36.655 --> 02:24:39.076]  What's happened with Barack Obama?
[02:24:39.076 --> 02:24:46.160]  This whole technique of problem reaction solution we're now seeing in America, and indeed globally, because of Obama's global influence.
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:48.541]  I mean, I was in Africa recently, a few weeks ago.
[02:24:48.541 --> 02:24:50.763]  I mean, crikey, he's a god there.
[02:24:50.763 --> 02:24:51.923]  I guess you can understand why.
[02:24:51.923 --> 02:24:52.944]  But if they knew that the
[02:24:54.133 --> 02:24:54.233]  The
[02:25:14.007 --> 02:25:32.552]  And he was also arrogant, and didn't care, and lied, and said, I don't read the newspaper, exactly a perfect psy-op what the Romans would do with a governor, give them an abusive governor, but then bring in a slicker governor who could engage in even more abuse and the people would accept him as a savior.
[02:25:33.263 --> 02:25:33.783]  Exactly.
[02:25:33.783 --> 02:25:42.850]  One of the interesting things between the mid-90s and about 2002, I did enormous amounts of research into mind control, individual and mass mind control.
[02:25:42.850 --> 02:25:55.320]  One of the staggering things you came across when you talked to some of these individual victims of mind control was that they had a, I wouldn't say a love, but they had this enormous affection
[02:25:56.263 --> 02:25:56.503]  I think?
[02:26:09.933 --> 02:26:27.206]  In outrage, and anyone who's not Bush has got to be better, and he's come along with his smiling face, the smiling Viper, and now he is going to, from January the 20th, be offering solutions to the problems that the Bush administration created.
[02:26:27.206 --> 02:26:32.710]  And people see, all over the world, they see a change in President.
[02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:33.641]  I think so.
[02:26:53.664 --> 02:26:54.865]  We're on the march.
[02:26:54.865 --> 02:26:56.266]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:22.168 --> 02:27:28.131]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:27:33.714 --> 02:27:37.315]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[02:27:37.315 --> 02:27:38.276]  Be smart.
[02:27:38.276 --> 02:27:39.236]  Be safe.

[02:28:28.252 --> 02:28:35.217]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do.
[02:28:35.217 --> 02:28:37.299]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:28:37.299 --> 02:28:42.343]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[02:28:42.793 --> 02:28:45.794]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:28:45.794 --> 02:28:48.436]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

[02:29:28.183 --> 02:29:36.268]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?

[02:31:14.125 --> 02:31:17.586]  Before we go back to David, the 9-11 Chronicles, the
[02:31:18.660 --> 02:31:35.169]  9-11 film that shows you the 9-11 truth movement, police trying to claim they're going to plant bombs on 9-11 truthers in New York, claiming that cameras are guns, confiscating their cameras, but we had hidden cameras, world leaders being confronted, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Arnold Schwarzenegger,
[02:31:35.789 --> 02:31:36.409]  On and on and on.
[02:31:36.409 --> 02:31:37.790]  This is just such an amazing film.
[02:31:37.790 --> 02:31:39.110]  It's Cinema Verite.
[02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:40.230]  There's no voiceover in this.
[02:31:40.230 --> 02:31:42.471]  The one film I've made that's Cinema Verite style.

[02:31:51.334 --> 02:32:01.020]  That's why I've been offered big distribution deals by Universal and people and turned them down because I wouldn't be able to let you make copies of them, but we still need to sell a few so we can operate here.
[02:32:01.020 --> 02:32:16.369]  Also, my preeminent film on the overall New World Order system, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, what the elite's mindset is, how they're setting up the world government, how they plan to exterminate 80-90% of us with their own documents, the Bilderberg Group confronted, it's all there in Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.

[02:33:15.513 --> 02:33:26.802]  Okay, David, we've got a long segment here.
[02:33:26.802 --> 02:33:28.403]  Let's roll with it.
[02:33:28.403 --> 02:33:29.044]  Breakdown.
[02:33:29.044 --> 02:33:39.532]  I mean, he's clearly doing NLP, Mind Control Program, when he gives these speeches, the way both parties have gotten behind him, the way Pat Robertson is getting behind him, saying socialism's good, it will save us.
[02:33:40.513 --> 02:33:42.394]  Obama is unstoppable.
[02:33:42.394 --> 02:33:45.555]  We have Kissinger saying he is the man, the world's perception.
[02:33:45.555 --> 02:33:47.796]  This is an opportunity for a new world order.
[02:33:47.796 --> 02:33:49.496]  In fact, cue that video up.
[02:33:49.496 --> 02:33:51.217]  We'll play a clip of it later.
[02:33:51.217 --> 02:33:53.177]  Just the part where Kissinger says that.
[02:33:53.177 --> 02:33:55.198]  They're halfway through the three-minute clip.
[02:33:55.198 --> 02:34:03.961]  David, break down, David, what's happening with Barack Obama and how he's being sold and packaged as this messiah.
[02:34:03.961 --> 02:34:09.143]  Well, what they've done is used all the mass mind control techniques and the key one
[02:34:09.745 --> 02:34:18.901]  Is to turn him over the last year two years into a blank screen on which the people project their own version of what he is.
[02:34:19.542 --> 02:34:19.782]  I don't
[02:34:42.803 --> 02:34:46.244]  I stand for hope and I stand for something to believe in.
[02:34:46.244 --> 02:34:53.067]  Now the change idea is very effective because of the way the system screws people.
[02:34:53.067 --> 02:35:01.110]  At any point in time, the vast numbers of people are not happy with their status quo, the way their life is.
[02:35:01.110 --> 02:35:03.011]  So anyone who comes along and starts saying,
[02:35:03.749 --> 02:35:08.592]  I will change things is immediately open to that because it will go.
[02:35:08.592 --> 02:35:10.273]  Well, I don't like the way things are change.
[02:35:10.273 --> 02:35:10.953]  Yeah, change.
[02:35:10.953 --> 02:35:15.636]  I mean, Clinton did this when he got elected for the first time.
[02:35:15.636 --> 02:35:25.462]  And so they created a blank screen with Obama on which the people projected their version of what those themes meant.
[02:35:25.462 --> 02:35:29.644]  And so he became all things to all men and all women, those who could see through him, that is.
[02:35:30.543 --> 02:35:35.753]  And that's got him elected, and what it's done, and I'm sure that there have been
[02:35:36.810 --> 02:35:37.330]  Many of
[02:36:02.176 --> 02:36:09.843]  But compared with most presidents, a really big honeymoon period where he's going to be allowed to get away with a lot of things that other presidents like Bush wouldn't.
[02:36:17.523 --> 02:36:30.925]  They have this agenda and they want to push it on as fast as possible, and they understand this honeymoon period, anything goes for Obama, following January the 20th, that we're going to see things kick off real quick.
[02:36:30.925 --> 02:36:35.306]  We're going to see a blitzkrieg of activity before the public wakes up.
[02:36:35.306 --> 02:36:38.227]  And going back, look at all his betrayals, though.
[02:36:38.227 --> 02:36:43.087]  To get the anti-war movement that swept the Democrats into Congress in 2006, behind him, his handler,
[02:36:46.368 --> 02:36:48.689]  Who brought him and Governor Blagojevich up.
[02:36:48.689 --> 02:37:05.980]  Rahm Emanuel, who's an IDF officer, not only an American citizen, or dual citizen, a foreign Mossad operative, he openly is the biggest pro-war person in the Democratic Party, but it's come out now, he told Obama, lie and say you're against it, and then now he's the Chief of Staff.
[02:37:05.980 --> 02:37:13.204]  So just incredible betrayal, the wiretapping against the Americans, flip-flop on that, now he wants to confront Russia,
[02:37:13.844 --> 02:37:19.685]  I mean, Obama is doing 180 degrees from what he claimed he'd do, but now he's not saying anything.
[02:37:19.685 --> 02:37:22.666]  He's not weighing in on Gaza, on nothing.
[02:37:22.666 --> 02:37:25.106]  He's just sitting there and being our savior.
[02:37:25.106 --> 02:37:29.087]  Well, Obama's not just a blank screen in the way I've just described.
[02:37:29.087 --> 02:37:34.508]  He's also a blank mind in terms of his own intellect.
[02:37:34.508 --> 02:37:35.848]  He's just a front man.
[02:37:35.848 --> 02:37:40.149]  He's a salesman for the people behind him, not least the big new Brzezinski.
[02:37:40.149 --> 02:37:41.049]  And it's interesting that
[02:37:41.801 --> 02:37:46.742]  If you read Brzezinski's books and then you hear Obama's policies, they kind of mirror each other.
[02:37:46.742 --> 02:37:51.604]  I got a quote here from a Brzezinski book before anyone had heard of Obama nationally.
[02:37:51.604 --> 02:38:02.647]  And it said, this is Brzezinski writing, needed social reassessment can be encouraged by deliberate civic education that stretches the notion of service to a higher cause than oneself.
[02:38:03.654 --> 02:38:15.937]  As some have occasionally urged, a major step in that direction would be the adoption of an obligatory period of national service for every young adult, perhaps involving a variety of congressionally approved domestic or foreign good works.
[02:38:15.937 --> 02:38:25.840]  Now, of course, Obama has been talking about exactly that, and this is a key phrase here in terms of Obama, that stresses the notion of service to a higher cause than oneself.
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:29.521]  This is going to be one of the great ways that Obama sells the tyranny.
[02:38:30.163 --> 02:38:46.132]  He's going to sell it as people coming together, as serving a higher cause, and again and again you hear him, not just him but his wife as well in some of her speeches, talk about the fact that America is going to have to sacrifice to bring about this change.
[02:38:46.132 --> 02:38:50.234]  And one of the key sacrifices, without any question, is going to be sacrificing their
[02:38:51.554 --> 02:38:54.496]  Sovereignty and ability to govern themselves.
[02:38:54.496 --> 02:39:05.580]  And that's why Colin Powell and Vice President Biden-elect are all saying, get ready for things that are unpopular when they're speaking to inner core groups of Democrats around the country.
[02:39:05.580 --> 02:39:07.281]  It's been caught on tape a few times.
[02:39:07.281 --> 02:39:10.662]  They're saying the people aren't going to like any of this.
[02:39:10.662 --> 02:39:13.303]  And that's raiding the pension funds, starting new wars.
[02:39:13.303 --> 02:39:16.104]  And there's also this classic mind control.
[02:39:16.104 --> 02:39:17.585]  I want you to speak to this particular
[02:39:18.405 --> 02:39:19.146]  Tactic.
[02:39:19.146 --> 02:39:41.165]  They'll announce, we want world government, world government's good, new world order's good, new world order means world government, then they'll say, but I didn't just say that, and you're insane if you're against world government, and if you believe in world government it exists, and if you think it's good it exists, but if you don't want world government, you're insane it doesn't exist, and then we've seen, again, all these publications announcing world government in our face.
[02:39:41.165 --> 02:39:42.526]  It's the same thing with Obama.
[02:39:42.526 --> 02:39:43.287]  There's just this
[02:39:44.568 --> 02:39:55.362]  Almost like they're testing being ridiculous, lying in public, doing asinine things, and studying re-education camps in Soviet Russia and Communist China.
[02:39:57.904 --> 02:39:58.765]  That's what they did.
[02:39:58.765 --> 02:40:01.707]  They made the interrogations crazy.
[02:40:01.707 --> 02:40:05.149]  They made people change what they were saying and believing every day.
[02:40:05.149 --> 02:40:07.631]  They would say, I'll quit torturing you when you say you agree with this.
[02:40:07.631 --> 02:40:08.511]  Okay, I agree.
[02:40:08.511 --> 02:40:09.812]  They'd still go ahead and torture you.
[02:40:09.812 --> 02:40:11.653]  Now you have to say you believe in that.
[02:40:11.653 --> 02:40:25.123]  And it goes back to O'Brien in 1984 where, of course, Eric Blair, George Orwell was writing about being a former secret police member in India and then a propagandist at BBC at this mind control program of setting the precedence
[02:40:25.643 --> 02:40:31.245]  Yeah, one of the things that they're always doing is pushing things as far as they can, and they're looking for a public reaction.
[02:40:43.533 --> 02:40:43.873]  I don't know.
[02:41:01.733 --> 02:41:01.813]  I'm
[02:41:16.730 --> 02:41:16.790]  I'm
[02:41:35.905 --> 02:41:40.573]  Carry out every single bit of seizing your infrastructure to put international toll roads on it.
[02:41:40.573 --> 02:41:42.717]  So there's the example right there.
[02:41:42.717 --> 02:41:48.147]  Meanwhile, I'm on national radio debates and the talk show host laughs at me and says none of this even exists.
[02:41:49.147 --> 02:41:51.248]  Yeah, that's the way they work.
[02:41:51.248 --> 02:42:01.791]  In terms of Obama, we've got a mass mind control operation behind him that's far more sophisticated than I've come across.
[02:42:01.791 --> 02:42:02.511]  This is really a step up.
[02:42:09.053 --> 02:42:26.687]  Well, you said it, they're using every science they've developed together, overlaid, working on all eight cylinders, like I've never seen, and normally they would play off the left-right paradigm with both parties for the illusion of that the Congress and the President really run things and aren't just front puppets.
[02:42:26.687 --> 02:42:37.396]  You know, for the real guys upstairs, as you've said so many times, for the first time ever, they're telling us we must be unified, and for me, that is the signal that they are really moving into a new phase.
[02:42:38.618 --> 02:42:39.739]  Well, it was interesting.
[02:42:39.739 --> 02:42:49.228]  Years and years ago, when I was researching this back in the early 90s, I came across a lady called Kitty Little, who was an Oxford Don.
[02:42:50.123 --> 02:43:00.327]  And she told me that she attended a talk by someone at Oxford University in like the 1940s.
[02:43:00.327 --> 02:43:06.969]  And she got into this meeting, which was a closed meeting, because they thought she had certain political views and she didn't.
[02:43:06.969 --> 02:43:09.550]  And so she was an interloper and they didn't know.
[02:43:09.550 --> 02:43:13.572]  And this man stood up and he made the speech and he said that
[02:43:14.585 --> 02:43:17.706]  There was an organisation that had no name.
[02:43:17.706 --> 02:43:22.027]  He said, we don't give it a name because it's much more difficult to track it down if it doesn't have a name.
[02:43:22.027 --> 02:43:26.589]  He said it has a political wing and it has what he called a biological wing.
[02:43:26.589 --> 02:43:30.650]  The head of the biological wing was Lord Rick Rothschild.
[02:43:30.650 --> 02:43:33.411]  And he, he said, was the head of that time of the political wing.
[02:43:33.411 --> 02:43:38.773]  And he said as a result, there was going to come a point where he was going to become Prime Minister of Britain.
[02:43:38.773 --> 02:43:38.853]  And
[02:43:39.685 --> 02:43:47.672]  His name was Harold Wilson, and he became Prime Minister of Britain in the early 60s, and apart from four years until 1975.
[02:43:47.672 --> 02:44:09.129]  But what he said in that speech was that the infiltrators of this conspiracy were going to go into the right wing of the Labour Party, which was perceived then as a left-wing party, and they were going to go into the left wing of the Conservative Party, which was perceived as a right-wing party, because he said,
[02:44:09.870 --> 02:44:14.516]  People instinctively don't like extremists, so we're going to pose as moderates.
[02:44:14.516 --> 02:44:27.172]  He said, and what's going to happen is from control of both these parties, we're going to fuse them together to the point where they become one party under two names or three names with the Liberal Party.
[02:44:27.654 --> 02:44:37.678]  And what has happened in this country from the end of Margaret Thatcher onwards, particularly when Blair came in, is that is precisely what has happened.
[02:44:37.678 --> 02:44:44.260]  We have three parties in this country, two that have any chance of forming a government, Labour and Conservative, but the Liberal Democrats as well.
[02:44:44.260 --> 02:44:50.423]  You can't hardly, except in rhetoric, get a cigarette paper between them on most of these things.
[02:44:50.423 --> 02:44:52.343]  And the same is happening now in America.
[02:44:52.343 --> 02:44:54.044]  We're reaching this point where
[02:44:54.796 --> 02:44:54.916]  Yes.
[02:45:12.071 --> 02:45:14.593]  to fund themselves and aggrandize themselves.
[02:45:14.593 --> 02:45:16.914]  Now, there is no separation.
[02:45:16.914 --> 02:45:36.347]  And remember last year, David, in England, it came out that the House of Commons was being spied on by MI5, all their phones were being listened to, but that the main focus was on the few little parties that weren't controlled, and that they weren't worried about the three major parties, because those were basically already run by the intelligence apparatus.
[02:45:36.877 --> 02:45:38.817]  Yeah, well you've got Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister.
[02:45:38.817 --> 02:45:42.258]  You've got David Cameron, the leader of the opposition.
[02:45:42.258 --> 02:45:48.100]  They use different words and they criticise each other, but you look at their basic policies and what they would do in power.
[02:45:48.100 --> 02:45:50.300]  It's precisely the same.
[02:45:50.300 --> 02:46:02.423]  And so it shows how far along the road we've now come, where even the pseudo-fighting that went on before is now fusing into this one-party state.
[02:46:02.423 --> 02:46:04.864]  And what they've done with Obama is turned him into a
[02:46:06.736 --> 02:46:08.158]  I don't think so.
[02:46:20.910 --> 02:46:29.193]  A massive extremist who owes more to the fascist state of mind, especially the people behind him, than any socialist state of mind.
[02:46:29.193 --> 02:46:33.214]  Although if you go far enough left and far enough right, you meet the same situation anyway.
[02:46:33.214 --> 02:46:35.954]  And then we get into colors, using colors to program.
[02:46:35.954 --> 02:46:42.896]  Have you noticed that he and his wife, the night they won, both wore red and black and so did their children?
[02:46:42.896 --> 02:46:44.597]  Again, there's major messages in that.
[02:46:45.629 --> 02:46:52.453]  Yeah, I mean, they understand the way that vibrational codes affect people.
[02:46:52.453 --> 02:46:54.214]  And colors are vibrational codes.
[02:46:54.214 --> 02:46:56.555]  They're different colors and different shades of color.
[02:46:56.555 --> 02:46:58.116]  And that's the fascist color.
[02:46:58.116 --> 02:46:59.457]  And that's the fascist color.
[02:46:59.457 --> 02:47:01.238]  Red, black and white.
[02:47:01.238 --> 02:47:05.060]  And it affects you in a certain way and they speak to the subconscious mind.
[02:47:05.060 --> 02:47:11.524]  But I think one of the key things that we're going to see with Obama is the creation of a situation where
[02:47:12.458 --> 02:47:18.140]  If you're not for him, then you somehow need to be marginalized.
[02:47:18.140 --> 02:47:20.020]  And you're causing the economy to get worse.
[02:47:20.020 --> 02:47:21.681]  They're already saying that.
[02:47:21.681 --> 02:47:31.003]  If you do exactly what they say, and you don't question, and you go to the work brigades, and you hand your children over, and you spy on your neighbors, and you pay all these carbon taxes, things will be fixed.
[02:47:31.003 --> 02:47:32.103]  That's the solution.
[02:47:32.103 --> 02:47:38.005]  But if you stand in the way of the solution, you've got to be removed because you're the cause of the problem.
[02:47:38.775 --> 02:48:01.666]  Yeah, I mean, when these demigods and tyrannies come to power, I mean, Hitler's a classic example, anyone that's against them is attacked, is marginalized, is abused, is libeled and slandered, and it's designed to stop people being that nail that stands out above the rest, as the Japanese say.
[02:48:01.666 --> 02:48:02.967]  Stay there, David!
[02:48:03.687 --> 02:48:04.167]  David, stay there.
[02:48:04.167 --> 02:48:05.848]  We'll come back and continue with that.
[02:48:05.848 --> 02:48:07.988]  I want to talk to you, too, about a backfire, though.
[02:48:07.988 --> 02:48:09.469]  I'm seeing a backfire here.
[02:48:09.469 --> 02:48:17.751]  Because the system has lost so much credibility, people instinctively now, if they see someone being attacked, think, ah, they must be good.
[02:48:17.751 --> 02:48:21.812]  Okay, so what's happening there is the system loses more and more credibility.
[02:48:21.812 --> 02:48:22.432]  Stay with us.
[02:48:22.432 --> 02:48:24.973]  David Icke, compelling information.
[02:48:24.973 --> 02:48:25.593]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:28.266 --> 02:48:31.567]  So you finally decided you're going to stock up and store food.
[02:48:31.567 --> 02:48:34.148]  But why settle for bland, tasteless food?
[02:48:34.148 --> 02:48:35.568]  Why settle for less?
[02:48:35.568 --> 02:48:37.209]  There is an alternative.

[02:49:27.993 --> 02:49:34.639]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:49:34.639 --> 02:49:36.321]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:49:37.256 --> 02:49:38.797]  But who is the enemy?
[02:49:38.797 --> 02:49:39.617]  Bin Laden.
[02:49:39.617 --> 02:49:40.557]  This is his M.O.
[02:49:40.557 --> 02:49:41.978]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:49:41.978 --> 02:49:43.959]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:49:43.959 --> 02:49:51.102]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:49:51.102 --> 02:49:51.582]  Some U.S.
[02:49:51.582 --> 02:49:57.265]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:49:57.945 --> 02:50:01.446]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:50:01.446 --> 02:50:04.247]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:50:28.010 --> 02:50:31.535]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:50:31.535 --> 02:50:36.942]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:50:36.942 --> 02:50:41.648]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:50:42.930 --> 02:50:53.612]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[02:50:53.612 --> 02:50:59.373]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.

[02:51:41.357 --> 02:51:49.044]  Babylon system is the vampire, yeah Sucking the children day by day, yeah
[02:52:00.396 --> 02:52:06.024]  David Icke is our guest for another 40 minutes.
[02:52:06.024 --> 02:52:09.489]  He'll open the phones up in the next hour.
[02:52:09.489 --> 02:52:09.549]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:52:18.206 --> 02:52:20.487]  We're fighting the technological enslavement system.
[02:52:20.487 --> 02:52:26.069]  We're fighting the final revolution of the elite against humanity, trying to make themselves gods.
[02:52:26.069 --> 02:52:38.275]  I want to get into the genetic engineering, why they're destroying the environment in the name of saving it, what their final endgame is, if we don't defeat them, and more about us being empowered and taking action that you speak so elegantly to, David.
[02:52:38.275 --> 02:52:41.356]  But continue with the point you were making when we got interrupted by the break.
[02:52:43.140 --> 02:52:57.303]  Well, I just feel that, you know, Obama is going to be put up there in a situation where you're either for him and you're a good guy, or you're challenging him and you're just trying to destroy America.
[02:52:57.303 --> 02:53:06.965]  And the other thing that is going to be played, although he's talking all the time about, oh no, racism and all this stuff, the race card's going to be played as well.
[02:53:06.965 --> 02:53:11.146]  People who attack him, they're going to be called racist, and it's just because he's a black president.
[02:53:11.226 --> 02:53:14.209]  Oh, David, David, David, I know this has happened to you.
[02:53:14.209 --> 02:53:19.494]  On my website, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, we'll write an article with Rahm Emanuel saying compulsory service.
[02:53:19.494 --> 02:53:23.237]  We'll say we're against it, and every other comment is, you just hate black people.
[02:53:23.237 --> 02:53:25.840]  But then I notice it's mainly white yuppies saying it.
[02:53:25.840 --> 02:53:28.262]  Are they programmed, or are those disinfo?
[02:53:28.262 --> 02:53:33.947]  Well, that's an interesting point, and I would make this point very strongly.
[02:53:35.652 --> 02:53:38.155]  You know, I've got a great friend in Africa.
[02:53:38.155 --> 02:53:41.318]  He's a Zulu shaman, a very well-known man in South Africa.
[02:53:41.318 --> 02:53:46.904]  He's in his 80s now, and his perception of Obama is absolutely spot-on.
[02:53:46.904 --> 02:53:48.566]  He wrote a poem that's on your website.
[02:53:48.566 --> 02:53:48.846]  Yeah.
[02:53:48.846 --> 02:53:50.889]  Do you want me to give you a few lines from it?
[02:53:50.889 --> 02:53:51.509]  Read the whole poem.
[02:53:51.509 --> 02:53:52.050]  Go ahead.
[02:53:52.050 --> 02:53:53.411]  Okay.
[02:53:53.411 --> 02:53:57.656]  He wrote this poem after he saw Obama speaking on television.
[02:53:58.268 --> 02:54:03.831]  An actor walks upon the floodlit stage of life, wearing a mask of an angel beneath a demon's crown.
[02:54:03.831 --> 02:54:04.631]  A gown, rather.
[02:54:04.631 --> 02:54:10.174]  Pretense smiles upon the crowded hall of life, holding out hope as bright as it is false.
[02:54:10.174 --> 02:54:16.558]  Son of a woman in whose veins flows the blood of ancient Ireland and dark Africa's plains, you are Obama.
[02:54:16.558 --> 02:54:20.380]  Nicknamed the Standing King, you are Barack, O son born to deceive.
[02:54:21.101 --> 02:54:23.683]  The suffering hordes of Africa look up to you.
[02:54:23.683 --> 02:54:27.185]  See a black savior where naught but a Judas strides.
[02:54:27.185 --> 02:54:30.508]  An entrapper of nations, bringer of dismal war.
[02:54:30.508 --> 02:54:33.290]  Behind the robes and the nylon wings of hope.
[02:54:33.290 --> 02:54:36.132]  Oh may those who look up to you see you as you are.
[02:54:36.132 --> 02:54:39.194]  May those who hope in you behold you as you are.
[02:54:39.194 --> 02:54:42.256]  A prince deceitful to bring down Africa's shrines.
[02:54:42.256 --> 02:54:45.739]  A siren who leads Africa's ships onto rocks of obliteration.
[02:54:46.357 --> 02:54:49.338]  Your rule, my lord, will not be one of peace.
[02:54:49.338 --> 02:54:51.779]  Your reign, my king, will not be one of smiles.
[02:54:51.779 --> 02:55:02.702]  Some of the people that are going to be most disappointed about the reign of Barack Obama are going to be the black people of America.
[02:55:02.702 --> 02:55:08.364]  Because he's got a different color skin doesn't mean that he has their best interests at heart.
[02:55:08.664 --> 02:55:18.771]  Well, David, the first thing he's doing is massively increasing, and even the Huffington Post liberals are reporting this, massive forced abortion eugenics funding in Africa.
[02:55:18.771 --> 02:55:21.232]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:55:21.232 --> 02:55:22.673]  I mean, he is going after them.
[02:55:27.472 --> 02:55:28.013]  I think so.
[02:55:40.453 --> 02:55:41.714]  Stay there, David.
[02:55:41.714 --> 02:55:42.975]  Stay there.
[02:55:42.975 --> 02:55:43.676]  70-second break.
[02:55:43.676 --> 02:55:47.439]  We'll be right back with David Icke in the final hour.
[02:56:08.730 --> 02:56:13.614]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:56:18.218 --> 02:56:31.368]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:56:31.368 --> 02:56:38.134]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[02:56:38.454 --> 02:56:42.416]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:56:42.416 --> 02:56:45.818]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:56:45.818 --> 02:56:47.579]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[02:56:47.579 --> 02:56:53.723]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:57:11.975 --> 02:57:13.176]  Truth is our weapon.
[02:57:13.176 --> 02:57:20.542]  And PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:57:20.542 --> 02:57:22.924]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:57:22.924 --> 02:57:25.706]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:57:38.511 --> 02:57:42.112]  1-800-259-9231 is the number.
[02:57:42.112 --> 02:57:47.513]  We'll take five or six phone calls, four David Icke quick questions or comments.
[02:57:47.513 --> 02:57:49.693]  Coming up, he'll be with us for the next 40 minutes.
[02:57:49.693 --> 02:57:56.715]  Then I'm going to do a news blitz and have a little special surprise for everybody right at the end of the show today.
[02:57:56.715 --> 02:57:59.915]  You know I love surprises.
[02:57:59.915 --> 02:58:02.376]  David Icke, I want to go to calls in about 15 minutes.
[02:58:04.171 --> 02:58:08.154]  Though everything you say is so thought-provoking, I want to back you up and add to what you're saying.
[02:58:08.154 --> 02:58:27.347]  I'm going to attempt to shut up for the next 15 minutes and let you get into whatever subjects or areas you want, including solutions that you were finishing up with the black management overclass of the Judas Goat class that is tied into the New World Order just as much as George Bush or anybody else.
[02:58:27.347 --> 02:58:28.048]  Please continue.
[02:58:28.931 --> 02:58:38.177]  Yeah, this black overclass answers to the overwhelmingly white network of the Illuminati families.
[02:58:38.177 --> 02:58:41.839]  Well, almost entirely white network of the Illuminati families.
[02:58:41.839 --> 02:58:43.621]  And that's their allegiance.
[02:58:43.621 --> 02:58:50.005]  So just because a black face comes into the presidency or a black face comes into this position or that position doesn't mean
[02:58:50.803 --> 02:58:57.969]  By definition, he has allegiance to other people of that race in that country.
[02:58:57.969 --> 02:58:59.511]  His allegiance is to himself.
[02:58:59.511 --> 02:59:05.576]  His allegiance, therefore, is to those that he gets his rewards from and he gets his power from.
[02:59:05.576 --> 02:59:10.681]  So he's going to play their agenda out, not what he's right for.
[02:59:11.550 --> 02:59:16.132]  Poor black people and others in America.
[02:59:16.132 --> 02:59:17.513]  And that's what we're going to see.
[02:59:17.513 --> 02:59:26.317]  But he's going to play the race card, or it's going to be played for him, as you quite rightly quote Emmanuel there, where anyone who is against him is somehow racist.
[02:59:26.317 --> 02:59:28.278]  I mean, you get this when you challenge Zionism.
[02:59:28.278 --> 02:59:28.998]  You're a racist.
[02:59:28.998 --> 02:59:29.479]  No, I'm not.
[02:59:29.479 --> 02:59:32.360]  I'm against slaughtering innocent people.
[02:59:32.360 --> 02:59:33.440]  But we're going to see all of this.
[02:59:33.440 --> 02:59:38.603]  And this is why those that are standing up against this and
[02:59:39.421 --> 02:59:45.585]  Those that are becoming aware of it, we need to get the backbones stiffened up.
[02:59:45.585 --> 03:00:06.338]  We need to do what we know to be right and not be intimidated by all this stuff that's coming along and will come along to try to intimidate people into silence, including, as you're well aware, talk show hosts, where he's even talking about having to have every side of every story covered and you can't have an opinion, basically.
[03:00:08.217 --> 03:00:11.759]  Well, it's amazing.
[03:00:11.759 --> 03:00:13.960]  It's that comfort zone you talk about.
[03:00:13.960 --> 03:00:15.741]  We have to get outside the comfort zones.
[03:00:15.741 --> 03:00:18.623]  Those are really little prisons used to control us.
[03:00:18.623 --> 03:00:22.945]  And if we don't stop caring what people think about us, it's over.
[03:00:22.945 --> 03:00:23.566]  Yes, it is.
[03:00:23.566 --> 03:00:26.047]  And what we've got to do is let go of fear.
[03:00:26.047 --> 03:00:28.308]  And what we've got to do is become conscious.
[03:00:28.308 --> 03:00:31.130]  I might be getting into some deep levels here.
[03:00:32.727 --> 03:00:35.412]  There are many, many different levels to this, Alex.
[03:00:35.412 --> 03:00:41.863]  One of them is, very clearly to me after many, many years of this, is that we live in a virtual reality universe.
[03:00:44.501 --> 03:00:44.821]  I think so.
[03:01:14.062 --> 03:01:14.442]  I don't know.
[03:01:40.535 --> 03:01:53.243]  And if you are coming from a position of mind, in other words, you're identifying yourself with the body, the reflection in the mirror in the morning, that's me.
[03:01:53.243 --> 03:01:58.446]  Then you are operating on the level of mind, and we talk about mind manipulation and mind control.
[03:01:58.446 --> 03:02:00.907]  It's exactly what we're talking about.
[03:02:00.907 --> 03:02:03.369]  They manipulate us by keeping us in this
[03:02:04.236 --> 03:02:05.917]  It's like flipping a switch.
[03:02:28.570 --> 03:02:30.251]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:02:30.251 --> 03:02:34.993]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:02:34.993 --> 03:02:37.955]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:02:37.955 --> 03:02:41.016]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:02:41.016 --> 03:02:45.739]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:02:45.959 --> 03:02:47.139]  If you simply prepare.
[03:02:47.139 --> 03:02:50.880]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest.
[03:02:50.880 --> 03:02:52.921]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[03:02:52.921 --> 03:02:54.761]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[03:02:54.761 --> 03:02:58.722]  They voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air.
[03:02:58.722 --> 03:03:01.543]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[03:03:01.543 --> 03:03:07.745]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities.
[03:03:07.745 --> 03:03:10.686]  Particularly food, beyond many Americans reach.
[03:03:10.686 --> 03:03:15.147]  In pre-Nazi Germany superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days.
[03:03:15.427 --> 03:03:17.770]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[03:03:17.770 --> 03:03:22.236]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[03:03:22.236 --> 03:03:27.923]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[03:03:27.923 --> 03:03:31.167]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[03:03:31.167 --> 03:03:34.311]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[03:03:34.511 --> 03:03:36.332]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[03:03:36.332 --> 03:03:40.393]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[03:03:40.393 --> 03:03:44.534]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[03:03:44.534 --> 03:03:52.056]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[03:03:52.056 --> 03:03:55.997]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[03:03:55.997 --> 03:03:58.858]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:03:59.238 --> 03:04:06.222]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[03:05:45.521 --> 03:05:47.502]  Start growing real healthy food in your backyard.
[03:05:47.502 --> 03:05:51.745]  15,000 heirloom seeds, a real food insurance policy for difficult times.
[03:05:52.205 --> 03:05:55.131]  Heirloom seeds are the original varieties, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[03:05:55.131 --> 03:05:57.055]  The seeds date back over a century.
[03:05:57.055 --> 03:05:58.899]  The Mayflower bean came over in the Mayflower.
[03:06:00.051 --> 03:06:10.577]  Survivalistseeds.com wants you to become one of their heirloom seed farmers and sell them back your safe seeds year after year because demand is skyrocketing for the rare heirloom seeds.
[03:06:10.577 --> 03:06:21.203]  The globalists are buying up a lot of the companies, the majority of them, and not allowing the public to buy them anymore, so it's harder and harder to get them, and they're building all these emergency seed bunkers.
[03:06:21.203 --> 03:06:24.866]  I want to ask separately, David, about the whole biological takeover, why the globalists
[03:06:25.546 --> 03:06:54.909]  just just feverishly cross-species spider goats cloned milk in stores uh... to the point of having to label it now cloned or not cloned i showed that on tv yesterday if i go grab that other for their for me please i want to show that again it won't believe it uh... survival of seeds dot com folks be sure and check them out today uh... and please again visit info wars dot com a prison planet dot com and check out the films like in game terror storm uh... truth arising fabled enemies not only does it support us
[03:06:55.819 --> 03:07:00.521]  But it also gets the word out and people are really ready to hear the truth now.
[03:07:00.521 --> 03:07:07.105]  David, I want to continue with The Awakening, but I did want to ask you, are you not pleased?
[03:07:07.105 --> 03:07:15.949]  I mean, I'm seeing in the hundreds of interviews I do every month or so in my own show and people on the street that the majority of callers to shows are not even my own.
[03:07:15.949 --> 03:07:17.550]  It can even be a hostile radio show.
[03:07:17.550 --> 03:07:19.111]  The callers call in agreeing with me.
[03:07:20.638 --> 03:07:34.665]  And the people now are really ready to hear the truth, and I see a paradigm shift, and I think that's why the globalists are crashing things, so that they can be the only savior and feed the people and clothe the people, bringing us into this collectivist model.
[03:07:34.665 --> 03:07:40.728]  I mean, is not this whole new order takeover a response to their attempt to fully dominate us before we break free of their conditioning?
[03:07:41.924 --> 03:07:55.354]  I've been writing for years that there was a change coming, a change coming that was going to wake up vast, vast numbers of people, like a spiritual alarm clock, if you like, waking people up.
[03:07:55.354 --> 03:07:58.476]  And waking people up is absolutely the phrase.
[03:07:58.476 --> 03:08:01.799]  It's breaking the amnesic state that people live in.
[03:08:02.339 --> 03:08:25.192]  And, you know, going back to what I was talking about before the break, you know, this is a big focus, the focus of my work at this time, and I'm accumulating now enormous amounts of information about the fact that this is a virtual reality universe, and what we call mind is a construct of this virtual reality, this matrix.
[03:08:25.192 --> 03:08:30.955]  And if you are stuck in mind, then you are a program, basically,
[03:08:31.759 --> 03:08:33.400]  I've got a question for you.
[03:08:59.546 --> 03:09:22.712]  When you do that, instead of looking close up at a brick, symbolically, as you become more and more conscious, you're moving further and further back from the brick to the top of the hill, and now you see that what you were looking at, the brick, was actually part of a house, which was part of a street, which was part of a city, which was part of a country, etc.
[03:09:22.712 --> 03:09:25.793]  You're seeing what you were in, and you're seeing that
[03:09:26.647 --> 03:09:26.907]  What do you
[03:09:40.657 --> 03:09:40.977]  I think so.
[03:10:00.498 --> 03:10:12.969]  So what's happening with this awakening, Alex, is as people break out of the amnesic state controlled by mind into consciousness, they're starting to see what they couldn't see before.
[03:10:12.969 --> 03:10:15.671]  People say to me, it's so obvious, mate, why didn't I see it before?
[03:10:15.671 --> 03:10:18.373]  Because you were entrapped in mind.
[03:10:18.373 --> 03:10:20.935]  Now you're becoming conscious, you can see it.
[03:10:20.935 --> 03:10:24.999]  And the whole conspiracy is about holding us in a state of mind.
[03:10:25.359 --> 03:10:29.729]  If you look at society, Alex, it worships the mind.
[03:10:35.405 --> 03:10:38.166]  Uh, so-called elite Oxford students sometimes.
[03:10:38.166 --> 03:10:42.548]  They're the most difficult people to talk to compared with the general public about these things.
[03:10:42.548 --> 03:10:56.835]  But some old, some old starving person in Venezuela on the street, uh, or sometimes a poor homeless person, I'll talk to them, you'll just think they're some old drunk and it turns out they're incredibly aware and tuned into the universe and even know what you're thinking.
[03:10:57.435 --> 03:11:15.204]  They get it, but people who have been through the system, particularly the elite ones who have been through the system to a greater level than anyone else, they're programming into mind, into intellect, which is a desperately stupid, compared with consciousness, level of awareness.
[03:11:15.204 --> 03:11:17.446]  Because they're so specialized.
[03:11:17.446 --> 03:11:21.768]  They're so specialized to be inserted into the interlocking pyramids you talk so much about.
[03:11:22.228 --> 03:11:25.429]  Yeah, this is the whole point, you know, Alex, when you look at it.
[03:11:25.429 --> 03:11:34.273]  The whole system, the whole education system, is designed to turn out mind intellects.
[03:11:34.273 --> 03:11:37.274]  It's about passing exams, which is what?
[03:11:37.274 --> 03:11:46.418]  Taking information that they tell you to believe and regurgitating it out onto exam paper, and the better you do that, the more you progress within the system.
[03:11:47.751 --> 03:11:48.751]  We're good to go.
[03:12:17.210 --> 03:12:17.731]  That's right.
[03:12:31.022 --> 03:12:32.243]  I don't know.
[03:12:47.612 --> 03:13:01.748]  This is wrong, and they're the ones that are refusing to serve in the military and going to jail as a result, because consciousness is getting them to see the situation from the point of view of what's right, what's just, what's fair!
[03:13:02.812 --> 03:13:08.076]  Rather than from mind, which sees things in detail.
[03:13:08.076 --> 03:13:14.821]  They're also fundamentally getting out of just their earth suit and realizing they're not Israelis, they're human beings.
[03:13:14.821 --> 03:13:17.303]  Exactly, that's what consciousness does.
[03:13:17.303 --> 03:13:22.848]  Consciousness, once you become conscious, the physical body becomes a vehicle to experience this reality.
[03:13:22.848 --> 03:13:31.174]  It doesn't become who you are and then racism and division through race and division through country suddenly starts to fall and we start to realize we're all
[03:13:31.554 --> 03:13:32.094]  I don't know.
[03:13:48.603 --> 03:14:00.868]  Instead of being our base, you know, galactic programming of this ancient species in this wondrous universe, they're trying to give us the new false programming to stay within that very limited spectrum as you talk so much about.
[03:14:00.868 --> 03:14:04.189]  And we're almost out of time, and I promised to go to call, so we're going to go to break in a moment.
[03:14:04.189 --> 03:14:06.810]  We're going to come back and take calls for two short segments with David.
[03:14:06.810 --> 03:14:08.010]  We've got to have you back soon, David.
[03:14:08.010 --> 03:14:10.771]  We're very thankful and appreciative of your important time.
[03:14:10.771 --> 03:14:13.352]  And I know the audience is, but briefly, in the three minutes before break,
[03:14:14.392 --> 03:14:25.157]  The genetic engineering, the cloning of the milk, all of this that is now going on and happening, the cross-species engineering, the mass poisoning of the public.
[03:14:25.157 --> 03:14:35.321]  Why is the elite pushing to destroy the biosphere of the earth while grandstanding and claiming they've got to have world taxes to save it with carbon dioxide that's a red herring?
[03:14:35.321 --> 03:14:37.902]  Why do they want to destroy the earth and hurt the environment?
[03:14:38.464 --> 03:14:40.725]  Well, this actually goes on for what we've been talking about.
[03:14:40.725 --> 03:14:49.689]  If you take it one step back and you start to see what we're dealing with here, from their point of view, particularly from their point of view, the human body is a computer system.
[03:14:49.689 --> 03:14:53.451]  And what we call genetics is actually a computer program.
[03:14:53.451 --> 03:14:58.293]  And what they're doing by messing with genetically modified food and all these other
[03:14:59.011 --> 03:14:59.891]  I've got a question for you.
[03:15:28.201 --> 03:15:30.103]  You're disconnecting it from consciousness.
[03:15:30.103 --> 03:15:39.390]  Which is what the mercury and the poisons and the GMO and when we get the government documents and we get them out of England and out of Russia and the U.S.
[03:15:39.390 --> 03:15:46.136]  it says we got to poison them when they're young so they never fully develop and they're literally like biological androids.
[03:15:46.136 --> 03:15:53.162]  That's exactly the game and this is why again the point you made earlier I've been talking about this for years
[03:15:53.883 --> 03:16:04.346]  This massive assault on human freedom, on the human body, on the human mind, is because this period of change, this cycle is coming, and it's waking people up.
[03:16:04.346 --> 03:16:10.187]  And they're desperately trying to keep the lid down so that they can control for the next cycle.
[03:16:10.187 --> 03:16:17.829]  And therefore, they're attacking the young particularly, because they're going to be the adult people as this cycle really unfolds.
[03:16:18.544 --> 03:16:21.006]  And therefore they need to destabilize them.
[03:16:21.006 --> 03:16:23.027]  And that's why their food and drink is attacked more than anyone else.
[03:16:23.027 --> 03:16:25.388]  And that's why we've got the kids being put on Ritalin and Prozac.
[03:16:25.388 --> 03:16:30.291]  David, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, I'm only doing it with one segment today because time's precious.
[03:16:30.291 --> 03:16:33.934]  We're going to talk behind scenes for the PrisonPlanet.tv and internet listeners right now.
[03:16:33.934 --> 03:16:35.254]  Then come back to your calls after the break.
[03:16:35.254 --> 03:16:35.675]  Stay with us.
[03:16:36.804 --> 03:16:38.406]  Okay, John, I'm going to skip this break.
[03:16:38.406 --> 03:16:42.630]  David, we are just on the internet audience now because I promised to come back to calls.
[03:16:42.630 --> 03:16:44.992]  Let's put bookends on what you just said.
[03:16:44.992 --> 03:16:51.259]  I just read the other day in the New York Times, 100 million people on serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone.
[03:16:51.259 --> 03:16:55.583]  If that isn't THX1138 Brave New World, I don't know what is.
[03:16:57.805 --> 03:17:04.429]  I mean, they're attacking the police, the military, the citizens, all of us are in this together, and isn't that the great final illusion?
[03:17:04.429 --> 03:17:13.133]  Is that people that work for the system feel like they're part of the elite, when even high-level elites are being poisoned by their own system, and that's why people say it's a spiritual thing.
[03:17:13.133 --> 03:17:23.479]  There's almost this cosmic force, and you get into that, but I just can see that it's there, driving man towards destroying themselves, and it's overall a hatred of the species.
[03:17:24.219 --> 03:17:31.524]  Yeah, the thing is, I say to people in uniform, you know, I say to them, you know, you've got no power.
[03:17:31.524 --> 03:17:34.506]  You know, there's some people that love the uniform because they think they've got power.
[03:17:34.506 --> 03:17:36.387]  And I say to them, you've got no power.
[03:17:36.387 --> 03:17:40.110]  Your power is what you put on in the morning when you open the wardrobe.
[03:17:40.598 --> 03:17:44.541]  The uniform you wear is an extension of the state.
[03:17:44.541 --> 03:17:47.463]  When you wear the uniform, you're an extension of the state.
[03:17:47.463 --> 03:17:50.346]  When you take the uniform off, you have no power.
[03:17:50.346 --> 03:17:52.667]  And the only power you have is of the state.
[03:17:52.667 --> 03:17:57.631]  You're just another pawn in the game while thinking you are higher than the other pawns that you're policing.
[03:17:57.631 --> 03:18:08.640]  And these are the levels of society, these polices of society, which Obama wants to massively increase with his networks of civilian security.
[03:18:09.507 --> 03:18:14.131]  These are the people that need to wake up and need to realize that they have children too.
[03:18:14.131 --> 03:18:30.645]  I know of one who's high in NATO, who's just realized, he said he looked in the eyes of his four-year-old grandchild and said, I can't do this anymore because I know what I'm contributing to now, and he's trying to get information out about what's going on.
[03:18:30.645 --> 03:18:32.126]  This is what we need to do.
[03:18:32.859 --> 03:18:36.760]  The polices need to realize that they are the pawns also.
[03:18:36.760 --> 03:18:51.523]  Well, I was talking to a top doctor who's treated a head of state, and this head of state said, you know, I was grown up to, you know, that we have to exterminate 80% of people, keep the resources, but I look at people, and I know it's evil, and I don't want to be part of this.
[03:18:51.523 --> 03:18:55.003]  I mean, a lot of people in the system are having an awakening too, aren't they?
[03:18:55.003 --> 03:18:56.484]  Yes, they are.
[03:18:56.484 --> 03:18:59.664]  There's so much to be optimistic about.
[03:18:59.664 --> 03:19:01.585]  I mean, the challenges are there, of course they are.
[03:19:01.585 --> 03:19:02.385]  They want to push this on.
[03:19:02.785 --> 03:19:03.245]  We're good to go.
[03:19:25.686 --> 03:19:34.676]  David, as you said, though, in the one minute before we come back, quickly, I'd say Obama has two or three, four months when he first gets in until people wake up to that phase of the illusion.
[03:19:34.676 --> 03:19:39.021]  So they want to start a big war, a biological release, or a financial collapse.
[03:19:39.021 --> 03:19:44.307]  What do we do to expose this guy and stop him being able to carry the ball for the new world order in the first few months?
[03:19:45.014 --> 03:19:47.779]  Well, what we've got to do is keep whacking this information out.
[03:19:47.779 --> 03:19:53.408]  And people who are listening to this information, don't be a cul-de-sac for information.
[03:19:53.408 --> 03:19:56.273]  When you receive the information, there is a responsibility.
[03:19:56.273 --> 03:19:56.934]  Pass it on!
[03:19:56.934 --> 03:19:57.575]  Pass it on!
[03:19:57.575 --> 03:19:58.096]  Pass it on!
[03:19:58.584 --> 03:20:04.669]  By word of mouth, you can inform vast numbers of people very quickly if enough people do it.
[03:20:04.669 --> 03:20:05.790]  That's what we need to do.
[03:20:05.790 --> 03:20:11.754]  You're right, and we have incredible power, but we better use it now because they are planning to shut down the old web.
[03:20:11.754 --> 03:20:20.060]  The inventor of the web said a few days ago that it's going to die, they're letting it die, it's being killed, so we need to move right now.
[03:20:20.060 --> 03:20:26.665]  Folks, we're coming out of this break with OnlyPrisonPlanet.tv viewers and InfoWars.com exclusive stream listeners.
[03:20:27.486 --> 03:20:31.129]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:20:45.262 --> 03:20:49.143]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:20:49.143 --> 03:20:55.004]  The New World Order with its programmers admit that they're colonizing our minds, our souls.
[03:20:55.004 --> 03:21:01.186]  They are keeping us weak, confused, dumbed down, infighting.
[03:21:01.186 --> 03:21:02.466]  But the awakening is happening.
[03:21:02.466 --> 03:21:06.347]  David Icke, amazing guest, is our guest right now.
[03:21:06.347 --> 03:21:08.168]  DavidIcke.com is the website.
[03:21:08.168 --> 03:21:09.508]  We'll put that up on screen.
[03:21:09.508 --> 03:21:12.809]  Let's go to Ryan, first time caller from Georgia.
[03:21:12.809 --> 03:21:14.029]  You're on the air with David Icke.
[03:21:14.744 --> 03:21:16.465]  Yes, how you doing, Alex?
[03:21:16.465 --> 03:21:25.068]  First off, I just really want to tell you I'm very appreciative of just waking me up and informing me of all the information that's currently going on.
[03:21:25.068 --> 03:21:38.954]  And second, I just really wanted to say by far, I've been wanting to say this for a long time, Lindsey Williams, David Icke, Steve Quell, and Tex Mars are by far your most important guests that you have on your show.
[03:21:38.954 --> 03:21:43.776]  And I would just really appreciate if you can even get them on even more because every time they speak,
[03:21:45.880 --> 03:21:56.688]  I mean, I'd have David on every week or two if he'd do it.
[03:21:56.688 --> 03:22:01.352]  He's just very busy, but he has been agreeing to come on every month and a half or so.
[03:22:01.352 --> 03:22:03.974]  So I hope we can continue having David on, David.
[03:22:03.974 --> 03:22:05.215]  Yeah, well, that'd be great.
[03:22:05.215 --> 03:22:06.636]  Well, thanks very much, Ryan.
[03:22:06.636 --> 03:22:07.417]  Thanks very much for that.
[03:22:07.799 --> 03:22:11.461]  I'll give you an example of how things are moving on, though.
[03:22:11.461 --> 03:22:13.783]  I'm coming to America in about ten days.
[03:22:13.783 --> 03:22:15.524]  I'm going to be there for about two and a half months.
[03:22:15.524 --> 03:22:19.927]  I'm talking in Los Angeles on the 16th for seven hours, and then I'm going down to speak in Mexico.
[03:22:19.927 --> 03:22:23.109]  And after that, I'm going all over the world.
[03:22:23.109 --> 03:22:23.889]  I'm going to Greece.
[03:22:23.889 --> 03:22:24.870]  I'm going to Australia.
[03:22:24.870 --> 03:22:28.612]  I'm going to South America, to Brazil.
[03:22:28.612 --> 03:22:29.512]  I'm going to Croatia.
[03:22:29.512 --> 03:22:31.554]  I'm going to all these different places.
[03:22:31.554 --> 03:22:34.996]  And a few years ago, crikey, I couldn't fill a phone box in England.
[03:22:35.496 --> 03:22:36.057]  I think so.
[03:22:51.389 --> 03:22:55.874]  But I've been to 47 countries now and it's happening all over the world.
[03:22:55.874 --> 03:23:01.980]  Well, David, I look at your website traffic, I look at my website traffic, it's all going straight up on the Google Trends.
[03:23:01.980 --> 03:23:05.143]  And by the way, I talked to David a month and a half ago and he was on.
[03:23:05.143 --> 03:23:06.504]  He's agreed to come to Austin.
[03:23:07.145 --> 03:23:08.146]  I'm going to set that up.
[03:23:08.146 --> 03:23:16.571]  I have to probably talk to you in the next few days so I can go ahead and decide on a venue and set it up and get you over here for maybe a two day event.
[03:23:16.571 --> 03:23:18.232]  The problem is getting a big enough venue.
[03:23:18.232 --> 03:23:19.612]  You can probably get 5,000 people.
[03:23:19.612 --> 03:23:20.113]  I can probably get 5,000.
[03:23:22.634 --> 03:23:23.975]  I need to find a time that's good for you.
[03:23:23.975 --> 03:23:27.258]  I need to nail that down and do that here in Austin, Texas.
[03:23:27.258 --> 03:23:28.439]  I think that's the place to do it.
[03:23:28.439 --> 03:23:29.820]  So I'll let that out of the bag.
[03:23:29.820 --> 03:23:34.023]  David's agreed to come here and speak with myself and he'll do his presentation.
[03:23:34.023 --> 03:23:36.965]  I'll do a briefer PowerPoint presentation.
[03:23:36.965 --> 03:23:41.929]  So that's coming up, the two of us teaming up, because we all have to come together during this critical time.
[03:23:41.929 --> 03:23:43.971]  I appreciate your call, Ryan.
[03:23:43.971 --> 03:23:46.012]  Anna in Idaho, you're on the air.
[03:23:46.012 --> 03:23:48.394]  Go ahead.
[03:23:48.394 --> 03:23:49.475]  Hello, can you hear me?
[03:23:49.475 --> 03:23:50.516]  Yes, Anna, you're on the air.
[03:23:51.405 --> 03:23:55.847]  I have to agree with the caller that was just on, Ryan.
[03:23:55.847 --> 03:24:00.209]  I love it when you have David Icke or Steve Quayle.
[03:24:00.209 --> 03:24:01.969]  I just wanted to say thank you.
[03:24:01.969 --> 03:24:02.790]  I'm a huge fan.
[03:24:02.790 --> 03:24:05.831]  I wish you could go on tour.
[03:24:05.831 --> 03:24:08.032]  I want to meet you in person.
[03:24:08.032 --> 03:24:09.852]  And that's all I wanted to say, is thank you.
[03:24:09.852 --> 03:24:12.514]  Thank you to you and David and everything you do.
[03:24:12.514 --> 03:24:13.294]  Oh, thank you very much.
[03:24:13.294 --> 03:24:15.755]  What did I tell you?
[03:24:15.755 --> 03:24:17.035]  Absolutely.
[03:24:17.035 --> 03:24:20.137]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Montreal, Canada.
[03:24:20.137 --> 03:24:20.957]  You're on the air with David Icke.
[03:24:22.597 --> 03:24:22.897]  Yay!
[03:24:22.897 --> 03:24:24.298]  How's it going?
[03:24:24.298 --> 03:24:26.638]  I'm very happy to finally be able to speak to you both.
[03:24:26.638 --> 03:24:33.921]  I'm the webmaster of CriticalUnity.org and I syndicate a lot of both of your articles and videos on my site.
[03:24:33.921 --> 03:24:41.183]  As David mentioned, people need to take a good look at the big picture and not be intimidated by the elite's manipulation and scare tactics.
[03:24:41.183 --> 03:24:49.126]  The playing of the racial card is the only possible because racism was indirectly created by the elites by molding our worldviews
[03:24:49.787 --> 03:24:54.930]  As fascism unfolds, those who supported Obama, or any of these bloodlines, they're waking up.
[03:24:54.930 --> 03:24:58.132]  And we will stand against the corruption no matter what they throw at us.
[03:24:58.132 --> 03:25:00.954]  Our world, our lives, and our freedoms are at stake here.
[03:25:00.954 --> 03:25:12.641]  Because the people have been at the mercy of the malevolent... Sorry, I'm a bit nervous, but... We've been at the mercy of these malevolent powers that have taken over our planet.
[03:25:12.641 --> 03:25:18.725]  The people are ready to hear the truth, but as long as the majority has no opportunity to even know about Infowars, DavidEck.com, or
[03:25:20.238 --> 03:25:21.558]  How will they wake up?
[03:25:21.558 --> 03:25:23.600]  Well, we're doing that now, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[03:25:23.600 --> 03:25:35.767]  I mean, I'm not exaggerating when I say, without even looking, I can spend 10, 15 minutes on YouTube and count up videos that people are posting of my TV show or audio, and it's over a million a week just with that.
[03:25:35.767 --> 03:25:42.632]  You know, I produce films that have been seen, well, I can look on hit counters a piece tens of millions of times on the web, and that now is the new medium.
[03:25:42.632 --> 03:25:46.814]  And people have made tens of millions of copies of the tens of thousands of videos I've shipped out.
[03:25:46.814 --> 03:25:47.715]  Same thing with David.
[03:25:48.235 --> 03:25:54.438]  So, look at the newspapers failing, look at mainstream media losing its ratings while Alternative explodes.
[03:25:54.438 --> 03:25:57.319]  So, the word is getting out, isn't it David?
[03:25:57.319 --> 03:26:05.622]  It is, and we're heading towards a real explosion because the curve in Awakening is getting really exponential.
[03:26:06.142 --> 03:26:07.222]  It's a collision course!
[03:26:07.222 --> 03:26:08.203]  Hold on, David.
[03:26:08.203 --> 03:26:11.043]  We're going to skip this one, too, in the time that we have.
[03:26:11.043 --> 03:26:12.904]  Just for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[03:26:12.904 --> 03:26:14.564]  For everybody else, we'll be right back.
[03:26:14.564 --> 03:26:14.984]  Stay with us.
[03:26:14.984 --> 03:26:17.545]  Okay, David, continue with what you were saying there.
[03:26:30.462 --> 03:26:43.627]  You know, the exponential curve is now heading straight upwards because as more and more people understand the basics of what is going on, they talk to more people and the whole thing expands.
[03:26:43.627 --> 03:26:46.848]  So you reach a point eventually when it's an explosion.
[03:26:46.848 --> 03:26:48.948]  And we're absolutely on the cusp of that now.
[03:26:48.948 --> 03:26:51.349]  In fact, we're already beginning to see some of it.
[03:26:51.349 --> 03:26:54.390]  So, you know, this is a wonderful time.
[03:26:54.390 --> 03:26:55.951]  This is not a time to get depressed.
[03:26:56.471 --> 03:26:56.812]  Thank you.
[03:27:13.453 --> 03:27:24.264]  If you go to Google Trends and look at DavidIke.com, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Rents.com, all the hundreds of huge sites, my two are the biggest individually.
[03:27:24.264 --> 03:27:28.648]  Infowars is the largest alternative site, Prison Planet is the second largest, and there's Rents and Ike and others.
[03:27:30.029 --> 03:27:33.110]  If you look at them on the trends, it looks like this.
[03:27:33.110 --> 03:27:37.611]  I want to zoom in on this on the PrisonPlanet.TV camera over here if we can.
[03:27:37.611 --> 03:27:44.052]  And this is basically what the trend looks from 2003 when they started Google Trends, tracking all the sites, to 2008.
[03:27:44.052 --> 03:27:47.032]  You can go pull these up on the Google Trends site.
[03:27:47.032 --> 03:27:49.013]  Anyone can look at this for themselves.
[03:27:49.013 --> 03:27:54.734]  And the curve, the growth curve, is exactly the same for all of these alternative media
[03:27:55.294 --> 03:27:59.737]  Consciousness expanding, you know, lie-breaking websites.
[03:27:59.737 --> 03:28:01.018]  It is hyperbolic.
[03:28:01.018 --> 03:28:03.540]  It is straight up, David Icke.
[03:28:03.540 --> 03:28:19.751]  Yeah, so, you know, anyone that's sitting out there and is sort of frightened about doing anything or getting involved or all the rest of it, you know, there are millions and millions and billions and millions of people gathering now all over the world.
[03:28:19.751 --> 03:28:21.753]  We just need to get together and
[03:28:22.620 --> 03:28:23.021]  I don't know.
[03:28:39.062 --> 03:28:40.484]  No, just God bless you, David.
[03:28:40.484 --> 03:28:48.633]  And again, I've said this the last two times you've been on, but people still try to make hay out of it and you intelligently ignore it.
[03:28:48.633 --> 03:28:57.303]  They probably interviewed me for three hours off and on about you when a British crew was here for Channel 4, and the one little smart-ass thing I said ended up being in the film.
[03:28:57.904 --> 03:28:58.024]  Yeah.
[03:29:17.882 --> 03:29:20.403]  No problem, Alex.
[03:29:20.403 --> 03:29:24.305]  We all have different opinions at different times, and they're not always correct.
[03:29:24.305 --> 03:29:26.106]  We all grow.
[03:29:26.106 --> 03:29:27.186]  Of course we do.
[03:29:27.186 --> 03:29:35.890]  What we need to do is drop anything that divides us, any fault lines, any of this nonsense, because together we're going to sort this.
[03:29:35.890 --> 03:29:36.850]  Divided, we're not.
[03:29:37.190 --> 03:29:39.112]  Well, I think all of us that are awakening are right.
[03:29:39.112 --> 03:29:41.094]  It's just we've got different perspectives.
[03:29:41.094 --> 03:29:41.734]  Exactly.
[03:29:41.734 --> 03:29:44.697]  And then I've just had a chance to move and see things from different angles.
[03:29:44.697 --> 03:29:51.444]  Let's go ahead and, I mean, what's different from what you're saying about an evil overarching force behind it all with what Christians are saying?
[03:29:51.444 --> 03:29:53.806]  Really, again, it's all perspective.
[03:29:53.806 --> 03:29:55.548]  Let's go ahead and go back to the full transmission.
[03:30:04.912 --> 03:30:11.814]  Final segment with David Icke.
[03:30:11.814 --> 03:30:19.096]  Only have time to make a few final calls with him because I have some special information I'm going to be covering.
[03:30:19.096 --> 03:30:20.337]  Let's go ahead and jam in.
[03:30:22.679 --> 03:30:23.959]  Who is up next here, John?
[03:30:23.959 --> 03:30:25.400]  I got confused with the calls.
[03:30:25.400 --> 03:30:26.640]  Mark and P.A.?
[03:30:26.640 --> 03:30:27.860]  Oh, John in Canada.
[03:30:27.860 --> 03:30:31.021]  John in Canada, you're on the air with David Icke.
[03:30:31.021 --> 03:30:33.042]  How's it going there, Alex?
[03:30:33.042 --> 03:30:34.402]  Good, sir.
[03:30:34.402 --> 03:30:35.302]  Awesome.
[03:30:35.302 --> 03:30:43.405]  I just want to thank you guys very much for giving us an alternate source of international news right now, and I enjoy your show greatly.
[03:30:43.405 --> 03:30:50.487]  Alex, did you know that this last Christmas here in Canada was the first white one that we've had across the country since, like, 1974?
[03:30:52.509 --> 03:31:02.158]  Yes, global cooling is happening because the sun has the first time in 300 years of recording it, no sunspots, which are the huge flares.
[03:31:02.158 --> 03:31:04.461]  And so the earth is rapidly cooling.
[03:31:05.731 --> 03:31:11.855]  This is another area, Alex and John, where Obama comes into play.
[03:31:11.855 --> 03:31:17.058]  It's another one of his solutions in the agenda behind him.
[03:31:17.058 --> 03:31:29.245]  People will have noticed that his, if you like, environmental, energy, science advisor network of people are all, if you like, worshippers of Al Gore's version of global warming.
[03:31:29.825 --> 03:31:42.152]  And you're going to see Barack Obama pushing forward policies, ludicrous policies, to deal with a problem that's not actually caused by what they claim it is.
[03:31:42.152 --> 03:31:46.975]  Yeah, and we just missed the big carbon tax thing here with the last election.
[03:31:46.975 --> 03:31:49.737]  It was one of the main platforms for the Liberal Party.
[03:31:49.737 --> 03:31:58.202]  And I've talked to some people about the Liberal Party and how they're involved with, it's not just the Liberal Party now either, it's also the Conservatives who are involved with the Power Corporation of Canada.
[03:31:58.871 --> 03:32:03.093]  Who in turn is also linked with the genocide in Sudan.
[03:32:03.093 --> 03:32:14.958]  And every Prime Minister we've had in Canada almost since Trudeau, including Trudeau, has all been on the board of directors for the Paro Corporation of Canada.
[03:32:14.958 --> 03:32:21.381]  And Paul Volcker actually was on the International Advisory Committee as well.
[03:32:21.381 --> 03:32:25.062]  And you tell people this and they go, oh that's just business.
[03:32:25.062 --> 03:32:26.483]  It's got nothing to do with politics.
[03:32:30.384 --> 03:32:34.147]  Business in terms of the Illuminati is control.
[03:32:34.147 --> 03:32:35.568]  I mean, that's what business is for.
[03:32:35.568 --> 03:32:37.770]  They're just arms of control.
[03:32:37.770 --> 03:32:48.198]  This is why when I hear people of the left dismissing the global conspiracy and saying globalization is just greedy corporations, it's not greedy corporations.
[03:32:48.198 --> 03:32:49.919]  Corporations are a vehicle
[03:32:50.472 --> 03:32:51.473]  Hello, this is Mark.
[03:32:51.473 --> 03:32:52.293]  Hello, Mark.
[03:32:52.293 --> 03:32:52.794]  Hello.
[03:32:52.794 --> 03:32:57.116]  I want to thank both of you for opening my perceptions as well as many others around the planet
[03:33:20.678 --> 03:33:24.801]  To the truth of what is really happening.
[03:33:24.801 --> 03:33:31.547]  I'm pretty much a non-traditionalist, a non-conformist, but there are many out there who aren't.
[03:33:31.547 --> 03:33:36.591]  They're busy doing what they're doing.
[03:33:36.591 --> 03:33:39.214]  They want to believe in the good of government.
[03:33:39.214 --> 03:33:41.816]  They want to believe in the good of their community and all of this.
[03:33:41.816 --> 03:33:45.459]  The reality is these things are happening and they're not even aware of it.
[03:33:45.459 --> 03:33:47.701]  When I start to share these things, as well as others,
[03:33:48.485 --> 03:33:49.326]  I'm sure I'm not alone.
[03:34:18.687 --> 03:34:35.159]  I've listened, I've watched your show, or listened to your show, Alex, many, many times, and I've read your materials, Mr. Ike, and the thing about it is when you boil it all down, people don't know what to do, like taking simple steps of what to do to respond.
[03:34:35.159 --> 03:34:35.639]  Alright, I hear you.
[03:34:35.639 --> 03:34:36.960]  We have to end this here in just a moment.
[03:34:36.960 --> 03:34:43.365]  I'm going to let you go, and I'm sorry, no more time to go to Tim, Rob, and many others that are holding, and I want David to be able to close out in the last minute here.
[03:34:44.405 --> 03:34:46.868]  Last time we had David on, the time before that, he went through.
[03:34:46.868 --> 03:34:48.930]  Just say no to national ID cards.
[03:34:48.930 --> 03:34:50.712]  Say no to giving up your personal information.
[03:34:50.712 --> 03:34:52.054]  Start growing a garden.
[03:34:52.054 --> 03:34:54.596]  Start talking to your neighbors about the elite.
[03:34:54.596 --> 03:34:57.279]  The awakening is the solution.
[03:34:57.279 --> 03:34:59.321]  Overturning the false paradigm.
[03:34:59.321 --> 03:35:00.943]  Expanding the horizon.
[03:35:00.943 --> 03:35:01.224]  David?
[03:35:01.889 --> 03:35:15.802]  Yeah, once you break out of mind of the program and into consciousness, then you instinctively know what your contribution is, and you go for it, because when you become conscious, you let go of one of the great expressions of the mind construct, which is fear.
[03:35:18.744 --> 03:35:19.445]  What would happen if...
[03:35:48.955 --> 03:35:54.599]  What would happen if everybody wrote Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or DavidIke.com on all the paper money?
[03:35:54.599 --> 03:35:55.580]  That's already waking up.
[03:35:55.580 --> 03:35:57.761]  A lot of people coming to the site are because of people doing that.
[03:35:57.761 --> 03:36:02.424]  What would happen if people made copies of my films or handed out David Ike documentaries?
[03:36:02.424 --> 03:36:04.145]  Well, what is happening?
[03:36:04.145 --> 03:36:05.866]  We're seeing we're having an effect.
[03:36:05.866 --> 03:36:07.488]  We've just got to push that much harder.
[03:36:07.488 --> 03:36:08.488]  David, when's a good time?
[03:36:08.488 --> 03:36:11.930]  Because I forgot that I invited you to town and you agreed when we were on a month ago.
[03:36:11.930 --> 03:36:18.655]  When's a good time to call and talk to you and try to look at some calendars and figure out when it's good, say four or five months in the future, to get you to Austin, Texas?
[03:36:19.295 --> 03:36:21.837]  Okay, well, tomorrow's fine, or Monday's fine.
[03:36:21.837 --> 03:36:22.858]  Yeah, that'd be great.
[03:36:38.579 --> 03:36:38.959]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:36:38.959 --> 03:36:39.920]  Same to you.
[03:36:39.920 --> 03:36:40.220]  You bet.
[03:36:40.220 --> 03:36:41.741]  Take care.
[03:36:41.741 --> 03:36:42.181]  Cheers.
[03:36:42.181 --> 03:36:47.923]  There goes David Icke from the United Kingdom joining us for the last hour and 40 minutes.
[03:36:47.923 --> 03:36:48.684]  Okay.
[03:36:48.684 --> 03:36:49.944]  What is the surprise today?
[03:36:49.944 --> 03:36:53.846]  Well, it's not Alex Jones' Tyranny Crusher 1.
[03:36:53.846 --> 03:36:56.668]  This was the first time we ever did an eBay item.
[03:36:56.668 --> 03:36:59.849]  And the reason we did it is because people are like, well, this megaphone's broken.
[03:36:59.849 --> 03:37:00.569]  We've bought a new one.
[03:37:00.569 --> 03:37:01.850]  You've had this one for all these years.
[03:37:01.850 --> 03:37:04.411]  It's in the movie A Scanner Darkly that they rotoscoped.
[03:37:04.411 --> 03:37:05.632]  That's really me and the bullhorn in there.
[03:37:06.573 --> 03:37:10.075]  We're going to play a clip of that in a moment.
[03:37:10.075 --> 03:37:10.875]  This isn't a surprise.
[03:37:10.875 --> 03:37:12.356]  Surprise is coming up in a minute.
[03:37:12.356 --> 03:37:15.018]  Tyranny Crusher 1, you know, should we get it fixed?
[03:37:15.018 --> 03:37:17.479]  Like a $125 megaphone, or should we sell it?
[03:37:17.479 --> 03:37:18.860]  And obviously it's a fundraiser.
[03:37:18.860 --> 03:37:23.683]  We're not saying the megaphone, just as a megaphone, is worth $3,500.
[03:37:23.683 --> 03:37:25.944]  I think it's the latest bid on there for it.
[03:37:25.944 --> 03:37:26.484]  We opened it up at $1,500.
[03:37:28.240 --> 03:37:32.142]  There is Tyranny Crusher 1 on the PrisonPlanet.tv screen.
[03:37:32.142 --> 03:37:38.065]  This is, and I saw disinfo shills on the comments on that article going, how dare you try to make money!
[03:37:38.065 --> 03:37:51.152]  Again, when the establishment taxes our money and uses it against us, I'm not supposed to try to fund things so I have a good mic to get the voice out there well, to give you a good, you know, show of information, to have these guests on, to have a producer to schedule it, to have, I mean, it's asinine!
[03:37:51.152 --> 03:37:55.775]  And so because the establishment's criticizing me for trying to fund this operation,
[03:37:57.086 --> 03:38:00.369]  Which is like a pea shooter against their propaganda, but having a great effect.
[03:38:00.369 --> 03:38:01.230]  You know what?
[03:38:01.230 --> 03:38:04.413]  Just because of you, establishment, folks, go ahead and send me checks.
[03:38:04.413 --> 03:38:11.720]  You want to donate $100, $1,000, $5, whatever, you have my word that 95% of that money that comes in here will be used.
[03:38:11.720 --> 03:38:13.281]  The other 5% for me to live and, you know.
[03:38:14.002 --> 03:38:17.765]  Wear this on TV so it goes across well to folks and all the rest of it.
[03:38:17.765 --> 03:38:20.287]  Because it's my whole passion.
[03:38:20.287 --> 03:38:25.772]  As if we can't have a political or sociological passion and then fund our operation, or we can't sell our books.
[03:38:25.772 --> 03:38:32.498]  But everybody else in the establishment, they can sell their books and get ten million dollars a year to read off a teleprompter on the nightly news.
[03:38:32.498 --> 03:38:34.539]  There's no teleprompter here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:38:34.539 --> 03:38:39.824]  This is my heart and soul and my intellect and my research and the guests we bring you here and all the people we build up.
[03:38:39.824 --> 03:38:40.745]  So, you know what?
[03:38:41.900 --> 03:38:44.963]  I want to see $50,000 bid for Tyranny Crusher 1.
[03:38:44.963 --> 03:38:50.187]  I know we've got some big donors out there.
[03:38:50.187 --> 03:38:53.290]  I'll use 100% of Tyranny Crusher 1's money.
[03:38:53.290 --> 03:38:58.895]  100% of Tyranny Crusher 1's money, because we spent over $100,000 on this little studio, and folks, that's cheap.
[03:38:58.895 --> 03:39:00.436]  They're like, well, that's expensive.
[03:39:00.436 --> 03:39:02.678]  We have the cheapest switcher they make that's new.
[03:39:02.678 --> 03:39:04.560]  Twenty-something grand, you know, and the cameras and all of it.
[03:39:05.260 --> 03:39:07.182]  We're trying to really develop and expand this.
[03:39:07.182 --> 03:39:10.824]  It's having a huge effect now with just this new look that's not even that fancy.
[03:39:10.824 --> 03:39:15.768]  Instead of the videos on YouTube, each one every day, getting 10,000 views a day, it's like 60, 70, 100,000 views per video.
[03:39:15.768 --> 03:39:19.211]  I mean, it's getting crazy, all because of presentation.
[03:39:19.211 --> 03:39:30.820]  I'm going to have professional lighting people and folks come in with just a basic two-camera shoot for a news program separate from this, but I looked at the books, even after the money bomb, and moving into this new office, we don't even have the money for that.
[03:39:31.540 --> 03:39:33.102]  So, it comes down to that.
[03:39:33.102 --> 03:39:42.473]  So, all those COINTELPRO that are so angry, or people that are just jealous of the work we're doing, don't understand this is life and death, go in there and let's bid Tyranny Crusher 1 up all the way.
[03:39:43.959 --> 03:39:49.542]  Let's get it done, ladies and gentlemen, because this is a fundraiser for free speech and what we're doing here.
[03:39:49.542 --> 03:39:50.863]  Let's see how high it'll go.
[03:39:50.863 --> 03:39:52.864]  It closes out next Wednesday.
[03:39:52.864 --> 03:39:58.927]  And let's go ahead and play a clip from Scanner Darkly where you see Tyranny Crusher 1 and Alex Jones.
[03:39:58.927 --> 03:40:02.188]  When we post this video, people put links up saying I'm making it up.
[03:40:02.188 --> 03:40:04.409]  I'm not even in Scanner Darkly or Waking Life.
[03:40:04.409 --> 03:40:07.231]  Folks, that's COINTELPRO on the site saying I wasn't in Scanner Darkly.
[03:40:08.411 --> 03:40:11.933]  I don't talk about it that much, so I guess they just can't believe it.
[03:40:11.933 --> 03:40:17.776]  Or that a film I'm in this year is the top selection at South by Southwest, but I'll leave that as a side issue.
[03:40:17.776 --> 03:40:20.958]  And coming up at, what's the one up in Utah?
[03:40:20.958 --> 03:40:21.898]  That big one.
[03:40:21.898 --> 03:40:22.379]  Side issue.
[03:40:22.379 --> 03:40:24.960]  The point is we're having huge effects, and that's what we should.
[03:40:24.960 --> 03:40:26.061]  We should be ready for success.
[03:40:26.061 --> 03:40:27.161]  We should be ready for victory.
[03:40:27.161 --> 03:40:28.662]  Let's go ahead and play this clip from A Scanner Darkly.
[03:40:29.482 --> 03:40:31.863]  Where did Substance D come from?
[03:40:31.863 --> 03:40:33.443]  Why can't we stop it?
[03:40:33.443 --> 03:40:39.525]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose, the more Substance D is on our streets!
[03:40:39.525 --> 03:40:41.125]  Can't you figure this out?
[03:40:41.125 --> 03:40:42.385]  Look around you!
[03:40:42.385 --> 03:40:43.906]  Look how far we've come!
[03:40:43.906 --> 03:40:46.707]  Humanity wasn't meant to live like this!
[03:40:46.707 --> 03:40:50.408]  Our every waking moment, tracked and traced and scanned!
[03:40:50.408 --> 03:40:52.788]  It's time to stop submitting to this tyranny!
[03:40:52.788 --> 03:40:54.869]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[03:40:55.829 --> 03:40:57.533]  Uh-oh, it's our tax dollars at work!
[03:40:57.533 --> 03:40:58.975]  Protect us from ourselves!
[03:40:58.975 --> 03:41:01.039]  Hey guys, I used to be one of you!
[03:41:01.039 --> 03:41:02.662]  Stop selling out your own species!
[03:41:17.955 --> 03:41:19.578]  You scared me.
[03:41:28.956 --> 03:41:34.340]  This is a piece of memorabilia, the only piece I've ever sold, my most used bullhorn, it's in that film.
[03:41:34.340 --> 03:41:38.704]  It got the line cut in Denver when they attacked us, MSNBC employees.
[03:41:38.704 --> 03:41:41.826]  That's Tyranny Crusher 1, up at eBay, story at Infowars.com.
[03:41:41.826 --> 03:41:46.630]  Now here's a piece of memorabilia that I will never sell.
[03:41:46.630 --> 03:41:50.173]  I told you I had this, and I had people laugh at me and say I didn't.
[03:41:50.173 --> 03:41:51.354]  Charlie Sheen gave me this.
[03:41:52.862 --> 03:41:54.563]  And this is on the cover.
[03:41:54.563 --> 03:41:57.505]  In fact, bring me that video DVD cover, please.
[03:41:57.505 --> 03:41:58.446]  He told me to share it with folks.
[03:41:58.446 --> 03:42:00.167]  He said, you know, what should I do with it?
[03:42:00.167 --> 03:42:04.770]  He said, oh, frame it in your house or show it to your friends, whatever, because you're the real Wolverine.
[03:42:04.770 --> 03:42:07.692]  And he was 14, I guess, when he did that movie, or 15.
[03:42:07.692 --> 03:42:11.034]  And this is the letter jackets they gave them all in Red Dawn.
[03:42:11.034 --> 03:42:12.895]  You can see it on the cover.
[03:42:12.895 --> 03:42:14.236]  There's Charlie Sheen down on the corner.
[03:42:14.236 --> 03:42:17.158]  You can see the C of the letter jacket in that.
[03:42:17.998 --> 03:42:25.101]  And this is the original Wolverine jacket he wore in the film, and then he wore it after that in high school, so it's uh, torn up a bit.
[03:42:25.101 --> 03:42:30.744]  And I said, how in the world did you give me a piece of, remember, this is his first big movie, this is... I said, this is worth a lot of money.
[03:42:30.744 --> 03:42:33.866]  He said, don't worry about that Alex, you know, this is because you're the real Wolverine.
[03:42:33.866 --> 03:42:35.927]  That's how cool Charlie is.
[03:42:35.927 --> 03:42:36.247]  Look at this.
[03:42:39.189 --> 03:42:39.890]  Isn't that cool?
[03:42:39.890 --> 03:42:45.655]  And I've been so busy, I've got to get around to framing it, you know, at the Hard Rock Cafe or whatever in my house or something.
[03:42:45.655 --> 03:42:47.256]  But I mean, because I always loved that movie.
[03:42:47.256 --> 03:42:53.222]  I'll never remember, I came down to visit my grandparents in Austin with my dad and mom, and my dad said, come on, let's go see a movie.
[03:42:53.222 --> 03:42:54.863]  We went and saw Red Dawn.
[03:42:54.863 --> 03:42:56.745]  And I was just totally blown away by it.
[03:42:57.285 --> 03:42:59.868]  And Charlie Sheen.
[03:42:59.868 --> 03:43:02.010]  Just an amazing job acting in that film.
[03:43:02.010 --> 03:43:03.532]  But here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:43:03.532 --> 03:43:06.615]  I've got some other mementos that big stars have given me without me asking.
[03:43:06.615 --> 03:43:08.377]  I don't know why they give me stuff.
[03:43:08.377 --> 03:43:10.940]  Rick Linklater has given me stuff and other people have that I won't talk about.
[03:43:13.069 --> 03:43:14.609]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:43:14.609 --> 03:43:18.030]  And I thought I would show you this jacket from the film.
[03:43:18.030 --> 03:43:22.051]  In fact, let's cut to Jaron so people can see a wide shot of it.
[03:43:22.051 --> 03:43:28.252]  Let's get that camera aimed over there at Jaron so people can get a better view of it.
[03:43:28.252 --> 03:43:36.593]  And then after we do that, we are going to go ahead and go to a clip from Red Dawn where you see the jacket that's worn throughout the movie.
[03:43:36.593 --> 03:43:38.614]  There's quite a few scenes.
[03:43:38.614 --> 03:43:39.774]  Go ahead and flip it around for them, Jaron.
[03:43:42.284 --> 03:43:42.564]  I don't know.
[03:43:42.564 --> 03:43:44.166]  I mean, I forget I've got stuff like this.
[03:43:44.166 --> 03:43:45.387]  It's just so cool.
[03:43:45.387 --> 03:43:49.109]  Okay, uh, I can't think of a cooler piece of movie memorabilia.
[03:43:50.546 --> 03:43:53.589]  I guess Darth Vader's a lifesaver or something like that.
[03:43:53.589 --> 03:43:57.292]  Let's go ahead and go to the clip from Red Dawn that came out in the early 1980s or mid-1980s.
[03:44:20.157 --> 03:44:21.057]  I don't remember.
[03:44:21.057 --> 03:44:23.078]  I do.
[03:44:23.078 --> 03:44:24.619]  I think you're lying.
[03:44:24.619 --> 03:44:24.859]  Yeah.
[03:44:24.859 --> 03:44:32.641]  I'd have the wind to bleed your mouth.
[03:44:32.641 --> 03:44:33.702]  Later, bud.
[03:44:33.702 --> 03:44:35.342]  See ya, Jeff.
[03:44:35.342 --> 03:44:36.403]  Such dear history.
[03:44:36.403 --> 03:44:38.343]  Yeah, some of it.
[03:44:38.343 --> 03:44:44.206]  Now the great hunt out in a semicircle, I would say about the size of Rhode Island.
[03:44:44.206 --> 03:44:48.147]  Then they would ride forward, driving everything before them.
[03:44:49.614 --> 03:44:55.678]  Beast, men, even bugs.
[03:44:55.678 --> 03:44:59.541]  Now the ends would kind of close in to form a shrinking circle.
[03:44:59.541 --> 03:45:07.627]  That's what's happening in uh... That's what's happening in Israel right now with the... Same deal.
[03:45:07.627 --> 03:45:13.591]  Oh he tackles him in the jacket!
[03:45:13.591 --> 03:45:14.432]  Tackle the Ruski!
[03:45:16.274 --> 03:45:24.763]  By the way, I'm on Russia Today during Election Day coverage for a full hour.
[03:45:24.763 --> 03:45:29.567]  And of course,
[03:45:30.774 --> 03:45:33.456]  Red Dawn is the favorite film of the militias.
[03:45:33.456 --> 03:45:35.597]  And now I have the jacket.
[03:45:35.597 --> 03:45:40.840]  Wolverines!
[03:45:40.840 --> 03:45:41.340]  It's fun.
[03:45:41.340 --> 03:45:42.241]  I mean, we're in danger.
[03:45:42.241 --> 03:45:44.022]  A lot of us will get killed in this fight.
[03:45:44.022 --> 03:45:47.004]  But at least I get to meet cool people like Charlie Sheen.
[03:45:47.004 --> 03:45:49.685]  And there he is handing the .357 to his brother.
[03:45:49.685 --> 03:45:50.926]  The evil Second Amendment.
[03:45:50.926 --> 03:45:52.927]  Look at those rifles in the car.
[03:45:52.927 --> 03:45:56.229]  They just absolutely hate the Liberty.
[03:45:56.229 --> 03:45:57.770]  It's fun.
[03:45:57.770 --> 03:45:58.991]  It's fun, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:46:00.051 --> 03:46:06.113]  But that is a piece of memorabilia I will never sell, unless I guess my children are starving, and at that point there probably won't even be an eBay.
[03:46:06.113 --> 03:46:08.933]  Imagine how much that sucker would fetch, but you know what?
[03:46:08.933 --> 03:46:12.114]  Again, that's just how classy Charlie Sheen is.
[03:46:12.114 --> 03:46:17.176]  And he gives his friends people he really likes and things like that, and I'm just so honored to ever be involved in his life.
[03:46:17.176 --> 03:46:21.897]  That's why the system has tried to demonize him and attack him, and he was told shut up about 9-11 Truth, and they destroy him.
[03:46:22.597 --> 03:46:24.799]  They tried to in the media, but it was unsuccessful.
[03:46:24.799 --> 03:46:25.359]  One more look.
[03:46:25.359 --> 03:46:27.001]  People will probably never see it again.
[03:46:27.001 --> 03:46:29.082]  There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:46:29.082 --> 03:46:33.046]  The famous jacket from the movie on the Red Dawn cover.
[03:46:33.046 --> 03:46:39.771]  The Wolverine jacket that now I, Wolverine 1, own.
[03:46:39.771 --> 03:46:41.413]  What a strange life, man.
[03:46:41.413 --> 03:46:42.774]  Fighting tyranny has had its rewards.
[03:46:42.774 --> 03:46:43.514]  It's also had its...
[03:46:44.716 --> 03:46:50.459]  It's punishments, but at the same time, overall, it's good to be involved in liberty and freedom and fighting corruption.
[03:46:50.459 --> 03:46:55.582]  And I get to associate with all those that love freedom, love humanity, that have honor, that have courage.
[03:46:55.582 --> 03:47:03.106]  All of you that are into evil, you get to associate it with backbiting, backstabbing, lying, delusional abuse of scum, and the stench of death in New World Order.
[03:47:03.826 --> 03:47:06.648]  And I get to be around the heroes that care about freedom.
[03:47:06.648 --> 03:47:09.549]  And that's why I've got to step up to the plate and be the best I can.
[03:47:09.549 --> 03:47:12.811]  And be the most honest and focused and most well-researched I can.
[03:47:12.811 --> 03:47:16.073]  And that's why I work at least 18 hours a day in the fight against the New World Order.
[03:47:16.073 --> 03:47:18.275]  Because you only get one shot at this in life.
[03:47:18.275 --> 03:47:19.575]  And I want to be on the good team.
[03:47:19.575 --> 03:47:20.856]  And I want to be victorious.
[03:47:20.856 --> 03:47:22.597]  And all the glory goes to God.
[03:47:22.597 --> 03:47:23.658]  All right, folks.
[03:47:23.658 --> 03:47:28.020]  We'll be right back in the final segment of this amazing 8th day of January 2009.

[03:48:02.298 --> 03:48:04.419]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.

[03:48:41.588 --> 03:48:43.471]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:48:43.471 --> 03:48:47.095]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:48:47.095 --> 03:48:50.879]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding.
[03:48:50.879 --> 03:48:51.319]  We're good to go.
[03:49:20.862 --> 03:49:21.382]  We're good to go.

[03:50:40.868 --> 03:50:43.249]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:50:43.249 --> 03:50:46.991]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:50:46.991 --> 03:50:48.692]  Wolverines, baby!
[03:50:48.692 --> 03:50:49.892]  Ha ha!
[03:50:49.892 --> 03:50:50.372]  Yeah!
[03:50:50.372 --> 03:50:56.575]  You know, I'm not going to show you Charlie's note that came with it.
[03:50:56.575 --> 03:50:58.516]  I guess that's private.
[03:51:00.069 --> 03:51:02.051]  But, uh, I'm done talking about that.
[03:51:02.051 --> 03:51:02.992]  Want to read broadcasts?
[03:51:02.992 --> 03:51:12.663]  It's coming up on the InfoWars.com streams and we'll post this last two hours of video up at PrisonPlanet.tv for members when the show ends at T-minus four and a half minutes.
[03:51:12.663 --> 03:51:13.124]  But, uh...
[03:51:16.161 --> 03:51:25.146]  In closing, again, we're trying to fund this operation and the reason we're able to expand or maintain, I'm kind of wondering if we can expand or just maintain with the economy the way it is, we need more funds.
[03:51:25.146 --> 03:51:28.008]  And I hope you all get the books and videos and materials and also support our sponsors.
[03:51:28.008 --> 03:51:31.169]  And one of them is the place I buy precious metals.
[03:51:31.169 --> 03:51:37.993]  And Ted has still got gold at $60, $70, some of the pieces $80 under the price it's selling for.
[03:51:37.993 --> 03:51:39.034]  Gold is up.
[03:51:39.534 --> 03:51:42.856]  Right now, right at $15 today from yesterday.
[03:51:42.856 --> 03:51:46.058]  And you heard Dr. Paul Craig Roberts say we will have a depression worse.
[03:51:46.058 --> 03:51:48.099]  He never talked like that, the father of ergonomics.
[03:51:48.099 --> 03:51:49.400]  So I wanted to bring Ted on.
[03:51:49.400 --> 03:51:50.380]  Ted Anderson here at the end.
[03:51:50.380 --> 03:51:52.121]  He hasn't been on in about a week.
[03:51:52.121 --> 03:51:54.482]  Ted, you've got the super deal for people.
[03:51:54.482 --> 03:51:55.283]  Tell folks about it.
[03:51:55.663 --> 03:51:55.983]  I did.
[03:51:55.983 --> 03:51:59.524]  I was able to even back down a little bit on the British Sovereigns and Franks right now.
[03:51:59.524 --> 03:52:04.505]  I've got the French Frank at $2.04 and the British Sovereign at $2.52.
[03:52:04.505 --> 03:52:06.766]  So where is that price in the market?
[03:52:06.766 --> 03:52:07.386]  Like $7.60?
[03:52:07.386 --> 03:52:10.046]  Yeah, comparatively speaking.
[03:52:10.046 --> 03:52:16.548]  I did a little check on it and I was looking to see where I'd be at if I was going to do it at today's current spot prices.
[03:52:16.548 --> 03:52:21.429]  And the Frank comes in closer to $2.14 and the British Sovereign comes much closer to $2.70.
[03:52:22.904 --> 03:52:25.646]  And then I also have the Buffaloes.
[03:52:25.646 --> 03:52:27.227]  And again, I'll put 50 more out there.
[03:52:27.227 --> 03:52:33.793]  The bottom line on those is they're real hard to buy and I don't want to be selling something I can't deliver real quick.
[03:52:33.793 --> 03:52:39.377]  So the Gold Buffalo, we have those right now at $1,036 which is actually the same price when gold was lower.
[03:52:40.346 --> 03:52:44.870]  I'm just, you know, I get them to trickle in here and I'm able to get a little bit of supply and I'll let 50 of them go.
[03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:46.271]  So tell folks the coins you've got.
[03:52:46.271 --> 03:52:51.575]  You've got 50 Buffalos, impossible to get in most places, are huge premiums, no premium on it.
[03:52:51.575 --> 03:52:51.936]  50 of those.
[03:52:51.936 --> 03:52:54.157]  You've got a lot of Sovereigns and Franks, though.
[03:52:54.157 --> 03:52:54.818]  Yes, we do.
[03:52:54.818 --> 03:52:56.940]  That's the thing that I can get in your hands real fast.
[03:52:56.940 --> 03:52:58.621]  What about the Silver Half Dollars?
[03:52:58.621 --> 03:53:00.543]  Yeah, definitely the Silver Half Dollars.
[03:53:00.543 --> 03:53:01.623]  There's no question about it.
[03:53:01.623 --> 03:53:04.906]  They're at 840 or 168 per roll, a 20.
[03:53:04.906 --> 03:53:08.429]  And the reason why they're such a good idea, because if we do have a depression,
[03:53:08.882 --> 03:53:11.943]  You're going to have to buy things like groceries.
[03:53:11.943 --> 03:53:15.204]  And to have a big old gold piece may be too much money.
[03:53:15.204 --> 03:53:16.545]  And so you get into the silver.
[03:53:16.545 --> 03:53:18.886]  Besides that, silver is a much tighter supply.
[03:53:18.886 --> 03:53:21.266]  These are gorgeous, great coins.
[03:53:21.266 --> 03:53:22.427]  What's the price on those?
[03:53:22.427 --> 03:53:26.548]  They're currently, right now, again, they're at $168 per roll of 20.
[03:53:26.548 --> 03:53:28.349]  And Alex, you need to have silver.
[03:53:28.349 --> 03:53:29.429]  I mean, you really do.
[03:53:29.429 --> 03:53:30.550]  How much is that per unit?
[03:53:31.531 --> 03:53:32.471]  Down to $8.40.
[03:53:32.471 --> 03:53:35.635]  So that's an amazing deal with silver up as well.
[03:53:35.635 --> 03:53:37.376]  800-686-2237.
[03:53:37.376 --> 03:53:40.659]  The brokers will be there until midnight tonight.
[03:53:40.659 --> 03:53:42.721]  And does that deal hold through until tomorrow, Ted?
[03:53:42.721 --> 03:53:43.462]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:53:43.462 --> 03:53:45.124]  We'll hold it through midnight tonight.
[03:53:45.124 --> 03:53:47.166]  If the market's still strong, we'll do it tomorrow, too.
[03:53:47.886 --> 03:53:49.047]  800-686-2237.
[03:53:49.047 --> 03:53:56.032]  For PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, it's on screen right now.
[03:53:56.032 --> 03:53:57.033]  800-686-2237.
[03:53:57.033 --> 03:53:59.294]  Like the old cartoons, Bouncing Ball.
[03:53:59.294 --> 03:54:01.576]  800-686-2237.
[03:54:01.576 --> 03:54:03.437]  I mean, it is right there.
[03:54:03.437 --> 03:54:05.398]  And I want to know where to go, Deb.
[03:54:05.398 --> 03:54:11.142]  Do we have time at the very end of the show to go out with Ted's theme music and John will suspend his theme music?
[03:54:11.142 --> 03:54:12.243]  Yeah, get that ready for the last 45 seconds.
[03:54:13.604 --> 03:54:14.805]  Ted, I want to commend you.
[03:54:14.805 --> 03:54:16.526]  People cannot beat those deals.
[03:54:16.526 --> 03:54:20.569]  That is a steal anywhere in the market, and still most brokers can't get gold and silver.
[03:54:20.569 --> 03:54:22.930]  They're selling one coin at a time.
[03:54:22.930 --> 03:54:24.952]  You've been in this business 30 years.
[03:54:24.952 --> 03:54:26.753]  You're able to pass these savings along.
[03:54:26.753 --> 03:54:30.495]  Is that $70 or $80 under what the market is selling these for?
[03:54:30.495 --> 03:54:34.438]  Well, I mean, because the gold is up another $10, I guess it's closer to $80.
[03:54:34.438 --> 03:54:38.661]  And you know, the other thing, too, we're selling those creature books with the silver dollar way below cost.
[03:54:39.884 --> 03:54:45.946]  Yeah, a $25 book with a $20-something silver dollar that are going for premiums with the $6 shipping for what?
[03:54:45.946 --> 03:54:48.006]  How much?
[03:54:48.006 --> 03:54:48.387]  $26.45.
[03:54:48.387 --> 03:54:50.927]  So that's $20-something bucks under what it cost you?
[03:54:50.927 --> 03:54:51.567]  Yeah, it is.
[03:54:51.567 --> 03:54:52.148]  It really is.
[03:54:52.148 --> 03:54:55.789]  And people are buying the books and keeping the silver dollars and passing them on to people.
[03:54:55.789 --> 03:54:58.049]  I can't think of a better way to spread the word.
[03:54:58.049 --> 03:54:59.750]  And Ted just does this for our audience.
[03:54:59.750 --> 03:54:59.990]  800-686-2237.
[03:54:59.990 --> 03:55:06.171]  Hold on, that's my Starship Troopers music.
[03:55:06.171 --> 03:55:07.372]  John's got to cut that off.
[03:55:08.192 --> 03:55:09.833]  Where the gold at?
[03:55:09.833 --> 03:55:13.515]  I wanna know where the gold at.
[03:55:13.515 --> 03:55:14.676]  I wanna know.
[03:55:14.676 --> 03:55:15.356]  I wanna know.
[03:55:15.356 --> 03:55:16.557]  I wanna know.
[03:55:16.557 --> 03:55:17.717]  God bless you all.
[03:55:17.717 --> 03:55:18.458]  Take care.
[03:55:18.458 --> 03:55:19.999]  Rebroadcast starts now.
[03:55:19.999 --> 03:55:21.119]  Rebroadcast starts now.
[03:55:21.119 --> 03:55:22.020]  God bless you all.
