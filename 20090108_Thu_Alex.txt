[00:00.000 --> 00:13.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.960 --> 00:21.120]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.120 --> 00:38.360]  Well we have a very informative and riveting broadcast lined up for you today on the 8th
[00:38.360 --> 00:46.920]  day of January 2009 this Thursday edition Steve Quayle joins us in 30 minutes for an
[00:46.920 --> 00:53.360]  hour to talk about the economy what's happening in Israel and with what the big surprise is
[00:53.360 --> 01:02.400]  coming up on January 21st from Barack H. Obama that and a host of other important issues then
[01:02.400 --> 01:08.520]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us to go over the Gaza situation from his perspective also the
[01:08.520 --> 01:13.960]  economy's the former head of policy at the Treasury and the father of Reaganomics and then
[01:13.960 --> 01:20.920]  for an hour and a half today we are joined by David Ike and we could have him for two hours but
[01:20.920 --> 01:28.680]  I have a little surprise in that last 20 30 minutes of the show that for the viewers out
[01:28.680 --> 01:36.240]  there on prisonplanet.tv when we simulcast the last two hours and of course for the radio listeners
[01:36.240 --> 01:47.600]  but Steve Quayle Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and David Ike on January 8th 2009 so that is coming up
[01:47.600 --> 01:54.520]  today ladies and gentlemen well it wasn't hard to predict it the police have basically decided
[01:54.520 --> 02:02.160]  not to charge the individual who cold bloodedly shot a poor black man in the back the bullet then
[02:02.160 --> 02:09.000]  bounced off the concrete he was spread eagle when the officer sitting on his head the bullet went
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.920]  through his back into the concrete bounced back up in a mushroom formation and ricocheted through
[02:14.920 --> 02:22.440]  his lungs he died about an hour later at the hospital and I'd seen two different videos first
[02:22.440 --> 02:29.400]  the police said that there were no videos and it turned out they'd confiscated videos and claimed
[02:29.400 --> 02:35.840]  that the videos were not working there at the dart station they confiscated citizens now known as
[02:35.840 --> 02:42.320]  civilian slaves cameras but it turned out two people had gotten video now another video has
[02:42.320 --> 02:47.320]  surfaced that police weren't able to confiscate and now I've seen more of this officer's body
[02:47.320 --> 02:54.280]  language up close and he looks like he's completely out of his mind he's resigned from the force and
[02:54.280 --> 02:59.440]  now the police are saying well we're no longer involved in this because he's resigned so now
[02:59.440 --> 03:06.320]  it's not our issue and now eternal affairs isn't investigating what does that mean so if a cop
[03:06.320 --> 03:15.640]  murders somebody either capital murder premeditated or whether it's it's manslaughter whether
[03:15.640 --> 03:19.720]  it's accidental and I think clearly it's it's pointing towards capital murder now this guy's
[03:19.720 --> 03:27.040]  a lunatic I mean I could see him getting off on a insanity plea maybe because you watching he
[03:27.040 --> 03:34.160]  pulls the gun out he cites it and you know you know the difference between a black what looks like
[03:34.160 --> 03:42.800]  a Glock or heckler and coke you know classic standard issue handgun looks like nine millimeter
[03:42.800 --> 03:47.600]  40 cal something along those lines we don't know yet they've they've kept that secret and he cites
[03:47.600 --> 03:53.200]  it holds the shot for about two seconds and shoots the guy in the back now I'd said maybe it was
[03:53.200 --> 03:58.240]  taser confusion but now watching him from a closer video angle off somebody's cell phone
[03:58.240 --> 04:05.280]  camera he looks like a vampiric demon or something he looks like Bella Lugosi he just his eyes are
[04:05.280 --> 04:12.960]  completely crazed he looks like a lunatic and I'm not trying to get the guy off I mean I I was
[04:12.960 --> 04:18.000]  saying could be taser confusion but still why would they pull a taser when the guy's spread
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.120]  eagle on the ground with cops sitting on his head when he didn't resist why did they lie and say
[04:23.120 --> 04:28.680]  there weren't videotapes or recordings why did they lie and say there was a scuffle going on and
[04:28.680 --> 04:33.320]  the media shows the video and says you can see a scuffle there's no scuffle the guy's laying
[04:33.320 --> 04:40.200]  there one cop jumps on his head so he flinches you see him in pain slightly flinch I guess his
[04:40.200 --> 04:44.840]  hands move off the ground about two inches and I guess that's a death penalty hey when we jump on
[04:44.840 --> 04:50.400]  your head with our knees when we jump on your neck if you flinch and the poor guy's begging he's
[04:50.400 --> 04:53.920]  saying please I got a four-year-old daughter please don't tase me because witnesses said the cop
[04:53.920 --> 05:00.080]  was threatening to tase him he's they just murdered him now there's been riots in San Francisco
[05:00.080 --> 05:05.880]  hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient
[05:05.880 --> 05:10.040]  and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is
[05:10.040 --> 05:14.360]  the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to
[05:14.360 --> 05:19.200]  go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply
[05:19.200 --> 05:23.840]  prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest so they
[05:23.840 --> 05:28.280]  ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print
[05:28.280 --> 05:33.080]  eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the American
[05:33.080 --> 05:38.120]  and European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[05:38.120 --> 05:43.440]  nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many Americans reach in
[05:43.440 --> 05:48.440]  pre-Nancy Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it
[05:48.440 --> 05:53.720]  reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may
[05:53.720 --> 05:58.840]  be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores
[05:58.840 --> 06:03.200]  enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in
[06:03.200 --> 06:08.320]  business whatever happens in America we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in
[06:08.320 --> 06:13.200]  on food one third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my
[06:13.200 --> 06:18.160]  friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there
[06:18.160 --> 06:22.040]  listening it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the
[06:22.040 --> 06:26.680]  government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of
[06:26.680 --> 06:31.240]  self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation
[06:31.240 --> 06:36.120]  but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli
[06:36.120 --> 06:40.920]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost of last

[07:07.160 --> 07:19.240]  storable food ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network protest
[07:19.240 --> 07:26.120]  over bark shooting turned violent San Francisco Chronicle I watched video of it when police
[07:26.120 --> 07:31.280]  started getting in people's faces and telling them to disperse that they were not an authorized
[07:31.280 --> 07:38.800]  permitted crowd they began throwing soda bottles and things at the police car windows they
[07:38.800 --> 07:44.920]  overturned police cars burned police cars the police began firing rubber bullets at
[07:44.920 --> 07:49.880]  the crowd and you know why the people are doing this they don't like seeing a fellow
[07:49.880 --> 07:55.760]  human being murdered execution style and then the system making excuses for it if you want
[07:55.760 --> 08:02.200]  any respect from the public you have to punish your officers when they murdered people in
[08:02.200 --> 08:09.040]  cold blood but no you've been caught lying and which is par for the course and we had
[08:09.040 --> 08:14.920]  a former top Texas police narcotics officer in here yesterday talking about how 85% of
[08:14.920 --> 08:20.800]  the narcotics officers he knew including himself planted drugs on people in their cars in their
[08:20.800 --> 08:26.200]  homes they used informants to do it and he's now running stings across the country and he's
[08:26.200 --> 08:32.400]  set to have a national TV show by the way showing all of this happening and going on
[08:32.400 --> 08:35.400]  incidentally we're going to get him a radio show here on Genesis in the next two weeks
[08:35.400 --> 08:43.840]  regardless out of my studios but he's already done one on XM but I was guessing 60% you
[08:43.840 --> 08:47.720]  know I didn't say that on air so when we come back we'll find out what percentage on average
[08:47.720 --> 08:53.680]  of narcotics officers plant drugs and I was going to say 60% he said no about 85 and I've
[08:53.680 --> 09:01.400]  interviewed famous New York detectives the one guy who what Swartz was his name who
[09:01.400 --> 09:07.080]  several of them but back in the 70s over 70% of the detectives in narcotics got fired
[09:07.080 --> 09:11.280]  New York City they turned out they were dealing drugs but I was trying to give the police
[09:11.280 --> 09:16.960]  a benefit of the doubt and saying 60% plant drugs and he said no it's more like 85% now
[09:16.960 --> 09:24.240]  let's be clear that's narcotics officers and narcotics task forces your average beat cops
[09:24.240 --> 09:33.000]  for my studies it's very rare for the you know the traffic officer to or bike cops to
[09:33.000 --> 09:40.280]  be out planting drugs very common for the FBI very common for narcotics officers and
[09:40.280 --> 09:46.720]  this goes to the heart of our judicial system they've now done DNA test nationwide on average
[09:46.720 --> 09:53.560]  over 30% or right at about a third of death row inmates are completely innocent in fact
[09:53.560 --> 09:57.440]  many times people on their deathbeds confess that they really committed murders and then
[09:57.440 --> 10:03.040]  they go DNA test the person that confesses they did it and it turns out it was their
[10:03.040 --> 10:10.000]  DNA and not the person sitting on death row I've always been for the death penalty I
[10:10.000 --> 10:14.640]  mean I believe if somebody kidnapped a child rapes him and kills him and you've got incontrovertible
[10:14.640 --> 10:20.720]  evidence execute them but I do believe that it's better that 10 guilty men go free than
[10:20.720 --> 10:25.360]  one innocent man fry the police have the attitude though that oh I'm sure you did something
[10:25.360 --> 10:32.640]  wrong I'll never forget when I was a teenager in Dallas other than getting in a lot of
[10:32.640 --> 10:39.480]  fistfights you know I was very clean again didn't like drugs I tried a few every time
[10:39.480 --> 10:46.040]  I hated them I liked alcohol when we can get our hands on it that was it and they would
[10:46.040 --> 10:50.880]  just call kids in all day long to the office and not just myself and say we know you're
[10:50.880 --> 10:55.840]  a drug dealer we know you're stealing stereos and you're gonna work for us now and I said
[10:55.840 --> 11:00.400]  no and then they got very upset but I mean this is just standard I'll never forget the
[11:00.400 --> 11:05.080]  cops saying well if you didn't steal those stereos I know you're doing something illegal
[11:05.080 --> 11:12.040]  and I was self-righteous and said yeah I've stolen beer out of the golf carts that's how
[11:12.040 --> 11:18.800]  teenagers got their beer in Rockwall Texas is there were golf courses all over the community
[11:18.800 --> 11:25.400]  in different neighborhoods and before I even had a car or a motorcycle or a moped we would
[11:25.400 --> 11:32.240]  walk sometimes a couple miles over to our buddy's houses and I only stole beer a couple
[11:32.240 --> 11:37.760]  of times but I had buddies did it all the time to the point of not leaving their ice
[11:37.760 --> 11:44.280]  chest in the back of their golf carts and they'd all be in the different golf I'm already
[11:44.280 --> 11:49.760]  digressing with this story the point is is that I said yeah I've stolen beer we know
[11:49.760 --> 11:53.560]  you've done a lot more than that this was years after I'd you know stolen beer out of
[11:53.560 --> 12:00.440]  ice chest imagine me in 13 14 years old and you run up grab a six pack of bottle of wine
[12:00.440 --> 12:04.600]  out of the back of the ice chest run off in the woods and drink it with your buddies and
[12:04.600 --> 12:11.640]  roll around in the leaves that's about the extent of it oh and and there was a convertible
[12:11.640 --> 12:16.600]  we could go to one easy mart we had to walk about two miles because the other convenience
[12:16.600 --> 12:20.800]  stores on the main highway by our neighborhood wouldn't sell youth cigarettes but the easy
[12:20.800 --> 12:28.240]  mart would but I did one time there was a convertible open with a pack of Marlboro
[12:28.240 --> 12:33.720]  Reds laying on the dash let's just have a little confession hour here and I grabbed
[12:33.720 --> 12:39.000]  that pack of cigarettes and I smoked them but that's it that's the extent of my great
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.320]  thievery but but the meanwhile we're criminals the entire population are criminals and we
[12:44.320 --> 12:48.120]  deserve it we deserve to be shot in the back because you know surely we did something wrong
[12:48.120 --> 12:51.680]  in our lives or we deserve to be framed for a murder because assuredly we did something
[12:51.680 --> 12:56.040]  wrong in our lives well then the police just run around framing whoever they want stealing
[12:56.040 --> 13:07.160]  houses stealing homes and that's okay that's a wonderful thing we're coming up later I'm
[13:07.160 --> 13:12.920]  going to play a clip from San Francisco news dealing with the crowds it's also posted up
[13:12.920 --> 13:18.720]  on info wars dot com prison planet dot com right now as the public fights back and if
[13:18.720 --> 13:23.080]  these riots were to continue the police would just dress up like protesters and then attack
[13:23.080 --> 13:27.480]  old ladies on video camera and then say the public was attacking old ladies as a false
[13:27.480 --> 13:32.640]  flag demonize the protesters as they just got caught doing in Greece as they just got
[13:32.640 --> 13:38.800]  caught doing in Denver to admit it police admit it cotton Denver as they got caught
[13:38.800 --> 13:44.400]  in Canada as they got caught in Seattle I mean we're constantly catching them I'll say Austin
[13:44.400 --> 13:48.760]  police aren't as bad they were just calling for violence and trying to shove a few people
[13:48.760 --> 13:57.400]  when we had the fortune 500 back in what 1998 in Austin Texas and I got in their facial
[13:57.400 --> 14:00.480]  cameras and said your police and then a bunch of cops ran across the street and said back
[14:00.480 --> 14:04.880]  off Jones and they inserted two more cops but they stopped stirring up trouble as they
[14:04.880 --> 14:09.720]  had riot cops across the street we were about to march from the Capitol to the fortune 500
[14:09.720 --> 14:15.040]  at the four seasons hotel on the river eight blocks away and they wanted to rubber bullet
[14:15.040 --> 14:20.600]  us they wanted to go into that crowd of 400 protesters maybe 500 and they wanted to bust
[14:20.600 --> 14:27.640]  some heads to then again more more riot funding more police hired but it didn't work because
[14:27.640 --> 14:35.720]  I know a six foot five two hundred and eighty pound cop isn't a little methamphetamine seventeen
[14:35.720 --> 14:42.840]  year old anarchist that's a tip to the police you really trying to infiltrate it's pretty
[14:42.840 --> 14:47.080]  obvious when you put your biggest guys in there biggest quote you know they can handle
[14:47.080 --> 15:02.360]  it if things get rough I mean give me a break how obvious okay here on the show throughout
[15:02.360 --> 15:06.840]  the broadcast so we'll be going into more detail with all of these US companies face
[15:06.840 --> 15:12.840]  409 billion pension deficit study shows out of Reuters now folks if you think there's
[15:12.840 --> 15:19.360]  a 409 billion dollar pension deficit got nothing coming they admit losses to 401ks which are
[15:19.360 --> 15:26.800]  private pensions individual pensions is several trillion dollars that money's been stolen
[15:26.800 --> 15:29.960]  and you're not getting it back what you're getting is a machine gun in your face unless
[15:29.960 --> 15:36.720]  you stand up now they're claiming with companies 409 billion in the US alone is bye bye but
[15:36.720 --> 15:41.800]  this is almost zero transparency from these companies see the owners of these companies
[15:41.800 --> 15:50.760]  they've already got offshore armored protected Caribbean island facilities they've all moved
[15:50.760 --> 15:56.360]  out of the country so that's where your pension fund money is in case you were wondering we're
[15:56.360 --> 16:01.600]  left behind with all the shaved head roi heads with machine guns rulings volatile of course
[16:01.600 --> 16:05.840]  their pension funds are going to be gone too but they like the system it's all right you
[16:05.840 --> 16:09.200]  know they like to plant drugs on us and rob us and abuse us well they get robbed by the
[16:09.200 --> 16:12.880]  bigger crooks you know that's how it works you like corruption you think it's cute well
[16:12.880 --> 16:18.280]  get ready for the society to totally fall volatile markets of saddened US companies
[16:18.280 --> 16:25.240]  with a 409 billion dollar deficit on pension funds reversing a 60 billion dollar surplus
[16:25.240 --> 16:35.000]  a year earlier so that's a 469 billion actually lost them as of December 31st pension funds
[16:35.000 --> 16:44.600]  plans among members of the standard and poorest 1500 had 1.21 trillion of assets and 1.62 trillion
[16:44.600 --> 16:49.240]  of liabilities Mercer said in a report released on Wednesday at the end of 2007 pension plan
[16:49.240 --> 16:55.960]  assets totaled 1.66 trillion and liabilities total 1.6 trillion Mercer said so did you
[16:55.960 --> 17:08.200]  hear that liabilities are 1.6 trillion and total assets are 1.66 trillion that means
[17:08.200 --> 17:14.840]  there is six billion dollars left see that should be the headline six billion dollars
[17:14.840 --> 17:28.800]  left in pensions from 1.66 trillion there's six billion left oh my gosh oh hey hey now
[17:28.800 --> 17:33.520]  you fix it you just build more FEMA camps and hire more cops that'll save us Obama warns
[17:33.520 --> 17:39.360]  of dire consequences without stimulus and now as I told you first they said it was 700
[17:39.360 --> 17:43.480]  billion then 800 billion now the new stimulus package which will be given to select crony
[17:43.480 --> 17:53.120]  corporations is over 1 trillion and that's here in the report out of AP Yahoo news president
[17:53.120 --> 17:58.680]  elect Barack Obama said Thursday the recession could linger for years I mean depression unless
[17:58.680 --> 18:03.120]  Congress pumps unprecedented sums of from Washington the economy he means into his
[18:03.120 --> 18:08.840]  friend's pockets this is Chicago level big machine taken over in the highest profile
[18:08.840 --> 18:13.800]  case yet of an issue certain to define and dominate his early presidency now here's the
[18:13.800 --> 18:21.680]  problem with that the world is moving away from buying US debt international herald for
[18:21.680 --> 18:29.520]  being today US debt is losing its appeal in China the biggest owner of US debt China has
[18:29.520 --> 18:33.040]  bought more than 1 trillion in American debt but as the global downturn is intensified
[18:33.040 --> 18:38.120]  Beijing is starting to keep more of its money at home and shifting that could pose some

[33:04.240 --> 33:07.680]  i learned a lot from fifteen years ago when i really started waking up right before i got
[33:07.680 --> 33:16.680]  on air before i do that i wanted to hit this news um on info wars dot com we posted a link
[33:16.680 --> 33:22.800]  to this story and the dis info trolls went in and said look at alex he's a liar he said
[33:22.800 --> 33:27.080]  they'd already built the trans texas corridor but now they're saying it's canceled those
[33:27.080 --> 33:31.400]  of it's gotta be dis info you know first the mainstream media said the trans texas corridor
[33:31.400 --> 33:37.160]  the north american nap to super high we didn't exist we got all the documents uh two years
[33:37.160 --> 33:41.120]  ago the legislature said okay we're passing a law against these toll roads these takeover
[33:41.120 --> 33:47.440]  by foreign companies the governor vetoed it and still enforced it then two days ago text
[33:47.440 --> 33:51.520]  stop without a press release saying it is dead but then under it said but we're gonna
[33:51.520 --> 33:56.080]  do the entire project in different sections just under a new name i mean it was in the
[33:56.080 --> 34:03.040]  article and people emailed in the media attacked me and said that it didn't say that then their
[34:03.040 --> 34:07.880]  other deceptive spin is to claim well alex i thought they'd built it yes they're building
[34:07.880 --> 34:15.840]  large sections of it just uh just uh east of austin all around austin we've got giant
[34:15.840 --> 34:19.160]  trans texas corridor billboards up everywhere they're putting toll roads on existing roads
[34:19.160 --> 34:22.760]  they put what six of them up in the last two years in austin swearing they wouldn't i mean
[34:22.760 --> 34:27.560]  they're there they're real i've gone out and videotaped them i put it in the film in game
[34:27.560 --> 34:32.360]  but still the public's under mind control and so the establishment can say no it doesn't
[34:32.360 --> 34:38.320]  exist so she first they said it didn't exist now they are saying they've canceled it which
[34:38.320 --> 34:43.720]  is a lie itself and the statesmen of all places a day after i made the point that it was dead
[34:43.720 --> 34:51.760]  in name only trans texas corridor name dies but not entire concept and it goes on to say
[34:51.760 --> 34:57.200]  plans of cross state tollways railways and utility lines officials say will be done in
[34:57.200 --> 35:03.040]  pieces it's the same thing they're just changing the name and this has been we're austin america
[35:03.040 --> 35:08.680]  statesmen there you go and then a day after i make the point that it's a fraud we post
[35:08.680 --> 35:14.560]  the article and the disinfo trolls come in and again isn't that they're hurting me it's
[35:14.560 --> 35:18.680]  that i'm illustrating how deceptive they are and there's no way these are just the
[35:18.680 --> 35:24.360]  general public the pentagon private corporations they admit that they have all these paid trolls
[35:24.360 --> 35:32.160]  on the web trying to counter us another issue and we're going to steve quayle is this we
[35:32.160 --> 35:37.080]  moved to the new office completely about two and a half weeks ago and i had this bullhorn
[35:37.080 --> 35:42.480]  that i use in the movie a scanner darkly i guess i've had five six years since the last
[35:42.480 --> 35:48.920]  one got broke got broken and it's the favorite model this big radio check model that i found
[35:48.920 --> 35:54.320]  is the loudest for the size and it's been in just countless demonstrations the last
[35:54.320 --> 35:58.160]  one was in denver we were bullhorning msnbc for covering up at nine levels and inside
[35:58.160 --> 36:01.720]  job outside and they came over grabbed it tried to rip it away then a guy comes up with a
[36:01.720 --> 36:08.840]  knife and cuts it it's on video and so if somebody wants to buy the bullhorn we have
[36:08.840 --> 36:14.720]  an ebay auction going they can fix that or they can keep it as a classic piece of liberty
[36:14.720 --> 36:20.640]  memorabilia and the disinfo trolls went to the article on info wars dot com that curtain
[36:20.640 --> 36:26.000]  memo posted alex jones tyranny crusher won bullhorn auctioned ebay and they yelled and
[36:26.000 --> 36:32.760]  screamed and said how dare you be selling this how dare you be profiting how dare you
[36:32.760 --> 36:36.560]  uh... you know be doing this when we've stated that we're selling the bullhorn to raise money
[36:36.560 --> 36:41.800]  to expand the studio we've built the new radio studio you've seen it looks great of your
[36:41.800 --> 36:48.040]  prison planet dot tv viewer we're building the new studio but in this economy we don't
[36:48.040 --> 36:52.440]  have the funds to do this if people don't support us but but think about what a mind
[36:52.440 --> 36:56.640]  game and this came out in the seventies in the co entelepro documents it just came out
[36:56.640 --> 37:01.640]  last year in a declassified two thousand four army manual on co entelepro in nations they're
[37:01.640 --> 37:07.880]  taking down to always talk about your opposition and say they're trying to make money now now
[37:07.880 --> 37:16.880]  now think of what a mind trick this is think of what a mind game this is the government
[37:16.880 --> 37:22.640]  can have offshore banks take it over and still a point five trillion and growing they can
[37:22.640 --> 37:26.840]  erect hundreds of new taxes eighty eight new ones in new york state alone carbon taxes
[37:26.840 --> 37:32.440]  taxes on cows flatulence total control of society regulate everything you do income
[37:32.440 --> 37:37.400]  taxes state income taxes franchise taxes sales taxes they take your money and use it against
[37:37.400 --> 37:43.800]  you and then they claim that alternative media isn't allowed to capitalize their operations
[37:43.800 --> 37:50.960]  that is get the money to expand they are so afraid and trying this asinine tactic against
[37:50.960 --> 37:55.720]  us that it's bad that we have good microphones and good cameras and make good films and have
[37:55.720 --> 38:00.800]  big powerful websites and reach tens of millions of people they are so afraid of that and just
[38:00.800 --> 38:10.080]  think of the ridiculous mind game they play so that's what it is the auction is going
[38:10.080 --> 38:14.960]  to be going until next wednesday night at about eleven thirty in the evening and then
[38:14.960 --> 38:18.520]  it closes out it's fifteen hundred dollars which is a drop in the bucket when you're
[38:18.520 --> 38:22.560]  buying equipment and I'm glad to say it's about twenty five hundred dollars now with
[38:22.560 --> 38:28.120]  last time I checked sixteen bids let me just click on it and find out what it is now and
[38:28.120 --> 38:31.560]  I hope fifty thousand dollars gets raised for the bullhorn it is at the point that the bullhorn
[38:31.560 --> 38:37.080]  is even worth that it's that it is a way to donate and have some fun donating and fund
[38:37.080 --> 38:45.440]  this operation and so in the spirit of fighting back against tyranny I want everybody I'm
[38:45.440 --> 38:49.960]  not ashamed I'm proud of the fact we're expanding and fighting the new world order even though
[38:49.960 --> 38:54.240]  our capital level has been shrinking somewhat because of the economy we need you to go to
[38:54.240 --> 38:58.080]  info wars dot com and buy books and videos not just because of the best books and videos
[38:58.080 --> 39:02.480]  out there the library we carry but because it supports what we're doing here in this
[39:02.480 --> 39:09.840]  highly effective message and so the psychological warfare tactic of saying we should be ashamed
[39:09.840 --> 39:16.200]  of rising and of being successful and of challenging the globalist we're supposed to live under
[39:16.200 --> 39:22.000]  a bridge and talk to people through a you know cardboard you know boxes bullhorn and
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.400]  just be a bunch of failures while the enemy has unlimited funding against us we're already
[39:26.400 --> 39:31.960]  like david against a ten thousand foot goliath and we're five feet tall here but they don't
[39:31.960 --> 39:35.440]  even like that so again you want to counter the new world order don't just support Alex
[39:35.440 --> 39:40.680]  Jones support all the other alternative media and if it isn't financial spread the word
[39:40.680 --> 39:45.560]  about the websites I forbid you write info wars dot com or prison planet dot com and

[41:26.960 --> 41:31.240]  is a message to the new world order that we are going to capitalize these operations we're
[41:31.240 --> 41:38.000]  going to fund them that's what we need odd enough said steve quill I really appreciate
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.160]  you coming on my friend well thank you alex I gotta tell you something your subject matter
[41:42.160 --> 41:47.200]  is so important I'm gonna key off the word mind control a little over a week ago someone
[41:47.200 --> 41:52.320]  who works deep in the heart of the underground world of psychological operations for north
[41:52.320 --> 41:57.640]  com I ran into him on the street of bozeman we had a two hour talk and he was convinced
[41:57.640 --> 42:04.040]  that I was the guy that he had to talk to by the way higher high enough ranking officer
[42:04.040 --> 42:08.480]  and I've known the guy so I know why he's you know he's not a plant or anything but
[42:08.480 --> 42:15.480]  alex here's the thing when you tell people that the government loads up up boards whether
[42:15.480 --> 42:20.120]  it's a blog against you a blog against me the different message boards out there that
[42:20.120 --> 42:24.760]  are always accusing me or accusing you of trying to get rich at at these people's expense
[42:24.760 --> 42:28.520]  I tell them to go and drop dead I'm sorry I'm a little bit more blunt than you are but
[42:28.520 --> 42:36.200]  what he told me alex is that they they are absolutely in control of the airwaves they
[42:36.200 --> 42:42.480]  plant their people on the boards anytime truth comes out they will either attack the information
[42:42.480 --> 42:48.280]  is being false they'll attack the messenger is being only in it for the money where that
[42:48.280 --> 42:51.920]  blazes where these people when you know what you've spent over the years and what's been
[42:51.920 --> 42:55.600]  spent on your radio program I don't well I mean it's targeting the general public that
[42:55.600 --> 43:00.720]  doesn't know what it's like to have you know what you do 1020 30 employees what I have
[43:00.720 --> 43:06.320]  1617 employees they have no idea that I wish I didn't have to spend my time grubbing for
[43:06.320 --> 43:10.680]  the money to fight the new world order because I'd be more effective I mean this this takes
[43:10.680 --> 43:16.400]  time this takes energy we're on shortwave nine hours a day I mean one of these half decent
[43:16.400 --> 43:22.000]  prosumer cameras not even professional cameras is six thousand dollars I mean we need the
[43:22.000 --> 43:27.040]  funds absolutely but let me let me get to this because I think this is incredible he
[43:27.040 --> 43:32.240]  told me the amount of money they're spending the defense department spending to fund new
[43:32.240 --> 43:36.440]  game development in the virtual world this is something I don't think people understand
[43:36.440 --> 43:42.120]  how many young people are involved in virtual games virtual identities half life you know
[43:42.120 --> 43:46.480]  I don't even play these things 10s of millions per game I saw a report two weeks ago never
[43:46.480 --> 43:53.360]  even got to it on air where the Xbox the military is using that now as a as the platform to
[43:53.360 --> 43:59.120]  fly predator drones and they want to hire the top scoring teenagers remember the last
[43:59.120 --> 44:05.720]  starfighter where where the alien force comes in plants the video games right you know he
[44:05.720 --> 44:11.960]  shows up in a sports car that's a spacecraft yeah perfect but that's exactly what I mean
[44:11.960 --> 44:16.320]  we're not saying aliens are going on that was Hollywood telling you the military developed
[44:16.320 --> 44:21.720]  these to actually find the best players and now they admit it that these are real drone
[44:21.720 --> 44:28.320]  attack simulators and they're going to hire the teenagers to to to remote pilot the predators
[44:28.320 --> 44:33.000]  absolutely when you can set someone to a virtual world you can divorce them from the real world
[44:33.000 --> 44:38.060]  by entangling everybody in what I would call the mind control psychological operations
[44:38.060 --> 44:43.120]  virtual world you keep them from the true information Alex and this is false reality
[44:43.120 --> 44:47.240]  with real reality until nobody can tell the difference but here's the deal I want everyone
[44:47.240 --> 44:50.680]  to understand you've been you've been spending a lot of time and effort over the years talking
[44:50.680 --> 44:55.400]  about martial law so I buy we've been getting all of the hits we've taken I don't care
[44:55.400 --> 45:00.160]  about the hits I'm taking but here's what people better understand on October 7th we
[45:00.160 --> 45:05.080]  were within two and a half minutes of going into full-scale martial law the command and
[45:05.080 --> 45:11.400]  control general that was up as a five-star general okay that whole guy was he's known
[45:11.400 --> 45:15.840]  on the radio I know who it is but it's a lighthouse when I talked to the gentleman who works deep
[45:15.840 --> 45:21.000]  underground I asked him I said to him who is a lighthouse he said that is the command
[45:21.000 --> 45:26.240]  and control authority for martial law I said how close were we to martial I didn't volunteer
[45:26.240 --> 45:30.600]  the information he said two and a half minutes is where the account let me stop you let me
[45:30.600 --> 45:35.840]  stop you this is not just Steve quell's opinion a senator in half of Oklahoma is on record
[45:35.840 --> 45:39.960]  on the news saying they were threatened with martial law October 3rd if they didn't pass
[45:39.960 --> 45:43.960]  the banker takeover that was the receivership of the nation by the foreign banks we've had
[45:43.960 --> 45:47.560]  two other congressmen on house members to tell you they were threatened with martial
[45:47.560 --> 45:53.480]  law and now Bloomberg and AP reported three weeks ago headline war powers act enacted
[45:53.480 --> 45:58.320]  by federal reserve the federal reserve is now above the even the executive absolutely
[45:58.320 --> 46:03.080]  and and what people have got to understand Alex is they have and I'm saying this as
[46:03.080 --> 46:07.680]  they take in every breath they breathe I want him to start making a conscious effort to
[46:07.680 --> 46:12.400]  realize that there are people that absolutely cannot wait this gentleman that told me high
[46:12.400 --> 46:19.040]  ranking military officer said Steve he said the plans for martial law are so off the charts
[46:19.040 --> 46:24.280]  and so horrible now understand we're not talking about foreign invasion he said I'm having
[46:24.280 --> 46:30.080]  really severe problems and he asked me quite candidly to keep him in prayer but look Alex
[46:30.080 --> 46:34.200]  this is someone that I believe look you know how many calls you get you know the different
[46:34.200 --> 46:39.000]  people they count on you can test the brass either information how many witnesses the
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.800]  Bible says about the two or three witnesses whether it be established whether it be established
[46:42.800 --> 46:46.760]  we get two or three thousand witnesses and you and I are fully making this stuff up so
[46:46.760 --> 46:51.360]  we can sell our books and I got a teller Steve Steve I hope we sell our books to warn people
[46:51.360 --> 46:55.840]  so we can expand and fight this thing but again that's the mind game but but the point
[46:55.840 --> 47:00.160]  is what is our message what is the information that's what's key but but let me I mean I
[47:00.160 --> 47:03.560]  wish our books were selling as much as Harry Potter we'd have this thing turned around
[47:03.560 --> 47:10.240]  but let me just finish making this point and then backing you up they are on record how
[47:10.240 --> 47:15.160]  many years you've been on here sixteen seventeen years as you say there were quiet preparations
[47:15.160 --> 47:19.280]  for martial law and give the evidence now it's all declassified now they admit they're
[47:19.280 --> 47:23.400]  going to use foreign troops now it's in major publications now they're admitting troops
[47:23.400 --> 47:28.280]  on the streets Marines running checkpoints this is really happening so the point is
[47:28.280 --> 47:35.440]  it all happened absolutely and and and not only is it happening see it's not enough Alex
[47:35.440 --> 47:38.920]  people have got to understand this I've got to tell this because this is really the thing
[47:38.920 --> 47:43.800]  that's burning in my heart is you've got to turn off the television the literal physical
[47:43.800 --> 47:49.440]  television and you've got to start doing your due diligence and not just listening to Alex
[47:49.440 --> 47:54.760]  Jones or Steve Quayle or Hock or whoever's out there warning signing on you know basically
[47:54.760 --> 47:59.400]  signing our our our lives saying look this is really happening we're not just telling
[47:59.400 --> 48:04.000]  you this for whatever reasons by the way I make no apologies that you know about having
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.280]  to do what I've got to do you asked me earlier before I went on there I came back on my Monday
[48:08.280 --> 48:13.520]  show because I had turned my show over to five different guest house as trying to turn
[48:13.520 --> 48:18.080]  it over so that you know I could give people the best I guess you'd say overview of everything
[48:18.080 --> 48:23.560]  going on from five different minds instead of mine okay well I'm back on on Monday because
[48:23.560 --> 48:28.920]  again I've spent 15 years of my life close to a half a million bucks out of my pocket
[48:28.920 --> 48:34.360]  to put you know the best program I can do you know to compliment all the other programs
[48:34.360 --> 48:39.000]  out there and quite candidly as you know it's tough to get people that will carry your passion
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.040]  carry your zeal and carry the warning and so what I've had to do basically and I've
[48:43.040 --> 48:49.240]  decided to do this is to in light of this fast-breaking concept that we're soon to be
[48:49.240 --> 48:56.280]  under total global domination we have to basically speak up yell scream kick fight and chew and
[48:56.280 --> 49:00.000]  because there may come a time very soon we're all off the air and unable to do this we have
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.240]  to prepare as if that's not going to happen but also prepare for it to happen so that
[49:04.240 --> 49:09.040]  we continue to expand fight the new world order but also make the personal preparations
[49:09.040 --> 49:13.000]  all of us before to go into the next phase I mean Steve what did you think of the last
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.320]  month when hundreds and hundreds of publications wall street journal financial times of london
[49:17.320 --> 49:22.000]  ap came out and said okay there's a world government it's for your own good we kept
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.800]  it secret from you but now it's going to be a world government run by private central
[49:25.800 --> 49:30.280]  banks and you'll pay carbon taxes for all your activities to us I mean that is what
[49:30.280 --> 49:34.960]  we always told people exactly being announced right and I think some of the people I'm
[49:34.960 --> 49:39.320]  going to be very kinder and gentler Steve I think people have better better get over
[49:39.320 --> 49:44.320]  their poultry dropping take another word for poultry drop attitude towards what we're
[49:44.320 --> 49:48.240]  telling them because Alex they're in our face they don't care anymore see that's what people
[49:48.240 --> 49:51.160]  don't understand they don't care they don't want to hide it it's in our face they're
[49:51.160 --> 49:55.400]  going to do it but the worst thing is is if people don't recognize it and start making
[49:55.400 --> 50:00.280]  a move to protect their family they're going to get steamrolled by this thing.
[50:00.280 --> 50:04.800]  Steve quell let's break down from your Pentagon sources you're right out there by north com
[50:04.800 --> 50:09.840]  where all this is going.
[50:09.840 --> 50:13.800]  Phase one of the insiders plan for a one world government has been initiated with the recent
[50:13.800 --> 50:18.840]  bailout international bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create
[50:18.840 --> 50:23.560]  a new currency and a new world bank to act as saviour but we've only seen the beginning
[50:23.560 --> 50:28.440]  their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times shortages
[50:28.440 --> 50:32.840]  and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land the insiders have discovered
[50:32.840 --> 50:36.280]  that they must control two things to seize total power.
[50:36.280 --> 50:40.640]  Phase one is a one world currency which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[50:40.640 --> 50:48.120]  Phase two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies go to www.foodshortageusa.com

[51:09.880 --> 51:15.080]  The day unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war
[51:15.080 --> 51:16.600]  against this country.
[51:16.600 --> 51:20.320]  The enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the enemy?
[51:20.320 --> 51:21.320]  Bin Laden.
[51:21.320 --> 51:22.320]  This is his MO.
[51:22.320 --> 51:26.120]  We have to look to the Middle East we have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[51:26.120 --> 51:29.960]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[51:29.960 --> 51:33.140]  intelligence networks inside the United States.
[51:33.140 --> 51:37.600]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[51:37.600 --> 51:39.760]  in and on the US.
[51:39.760 --> 51:43.480]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[51:43.480 --> 51:48.920]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[51:48.920 --> 51:52.960]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government and much
[51:52.960 --> 51:53.960]  much more.
[51:53.960 --> 51:54.960]  Fabled Enemies.

[52:00.240 --> 52:02.760]  titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[52:02.760 --> 52:10.160]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[52:10.160 --> 52:14.720]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol
[52:14.720 --> 52:18.960]  levels may not be fully detected by you but the symptoms are there.
[52:18.960 --> 52:23.840]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[52:23.840 --> 52:27.520]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[52:27.520 --> 52:32.040]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[52:32.040 --> 52:33.280]  across America.
[52:33.280 --> 52:37.160]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[52:37.160 --> 52:41.040]  Everyone has told me now how much healthier I look and I'm familiar with how much healthier
[52:41.040 --> 52:42.040]  I feel.
[52:42.040 --> 52:44.360]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[52:44.360 --> 52:49.560]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[52:49.560 --> 52:52.080]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[53:27.440 --> 53:31.280]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, father of Reaganomics, former head of the Treasury, will be joining
[53:31.280 --> 53:33.480]  us coming up in about 45 minutes.
[53:33.480 --> 53:39.440]  Then we got David Ike for an hour and a half, that's always interesting.
[53:39.440 --> 53:43.520]  We are live, 8th of January, 2009.
[53:43.520 --> 53:47.720]  So Steve, as you said, the mere fact that they're out in the open about all this now
[53:47.720 --> 53:52.680]  but put window dressing on it is a sign historically that they're going for broke, that they've
[53:52.680 --> 53:55.240]  decided to fully engage their operation.
[53:55.240 --> 53:56.920]  What will that operation look like?
[53:56.920 --> 54:01.880]  Okay, I ask that specific question and I'll get to the timing issue after I tell the operation.
[54:01.880 --> 54:07.760]  The operation is absolutely so planned out to the nth degree and Alex, every day they
[54:07.760 --> 54:12.600]  have meetings and they discuss what I talk on my show and I'm not flattering me or you,
[54:12.600 --> 54:18.360]  but they want to know how much we know and to every time we tell what we know, they plan
[54:18.360 --> 54:20.280]  around what we're telling the people.
[54:20.280 --> 54:22.120]  First of all, the internet's going down.
[54:22.120 --> 54:26.700]  The guy said, you must tell your listeners, the internet's going down.
[54:26.700 --> 54:32.080]  By the way, the inventor of the internet said Sunday in the BBC that it's quote, dying
[54:32.080 --> 54:36.160]  because these systems by design aren't being repaired or upgraded, so they're in a claim
[54:36.160 --> 54:37.160]  it's a failure.
[54:37.160 --> 54:38.160]  Absolutely.
[54:38.160 --> 54:44.080]  But let me say this too, I've gotten now multiple reports of the black box jammers being given
[54:44.080 --> 54:48.920]  to selected communities and I don't know the communities that they expect to have the most
[54:48.920 --> 54:54.240]  but the black box jammer is something that will cut all radio, all television, it cuts
[54:54.240 --> 54:59.960]  everything and listen, in a 12 mile radius, so it's a wide spectrum jammer.
[54:59.960 --> 55:04.160]  It's a wide spectrum jammer and they have been handed out along with the individuals
[55:04.160 --> 55:08.800]  that know how to work with them and that's what the Russians used in Baghdad to jam cruise
[55:08.800 --> 55:09.800]  missiles.
[55:09.800 --> 55:13.720]  Absolutely, but it's getting and so people say, well, I'll just call Steve or Alex on
[55:13.720 --> 55:14.720]  my cell phone.
[55:14.720 --> 55:15.720]  No, you won't.
[55:15.720 --> 55:16.720]  Well, I'll just get on my landline.
[55:16.720 --> 55:17.720]  No, you won't.
[55:17.720 --> 55:18.880]  I'll just get on the shortwave.
[55:18.880 --> 55:19.880]  No, you won't.
[55:19.880 --> 55:24.600]  The thing is, Alex, and this is something that I said to the gentleman that I was having
[55:24.600 --> 55:25.600]  to talk with.
[55:25.600 --> 55:26.600]  I said, so what are you doing?
[55:26.600 --> 55:32.600]  He said, I'm buying, and this is his words, he said, I'm buying food, I'm buying the weapons
[55:32.600 --> 55:36.880]  to defend my family and he said, I'm looking for a place too because he said, well, that's
[55:36.880 --> 55:37.880]  what I was going to say.
[55:37.880 --> 55:41.040]  What are they going to do when their own people walk off from NORAD and walk off from North
[55:41.040 --> 55:45.040]  Common, the police, walk off to help their families, then they bring in the foreign
[55:45.040 --> 55:46.040]  troops.
[55:46.040 --> 55:50.560]  And that's the other thing, you said, Steve, I'm seeing more and more foreign troops assigned
[55:50.560 --> 55:55.720]  to active duty U.S. troops stationed, and by the way, he said, the 30,000th a bunch
[55:55.720 --> 55:56.720]  of bunk.
[55:56.720 --> 56:01.800]  And by the way, people laugh at this, 20% of the armies, illegal aliens they hired,
[56:01.800 --> 56:06.160]  the biggest recruiting centers are in Manila, Philippines, the Mexico City, Ukraine, and
[56:06.160 --> 56:07.800]  then it's in major papers.
[56:07.800 --> 56:08.800]  They've signed deals.
[56:08.800 --> 56:12.840]  Remember Congress last year said we weren't told to use Canadian and Mexican troops in
[56:12.840 --> 56:13.840]  America.
[56:13.840 --> 56:14.840]  That was in the Toronto Star.
[56:14.840 --> 56:15.840]  Absolutely.
[56:15.840 --> 56:19.680]  And we can no longer call them the shadow boys, okay?
[56:19.680 --> 56:24.240]  I don't know if you saw on Drudge, but they showed five presidents, including current
[56:24.240 --> 56:28.080]  president-elect, and all I wish that someone would have drawn in or someone would draw
[56:28.080 --> 56:34.000]  in a cartoonist is just the puppet strings going up above all of them with the Illuminati.
[56:34.000 --> 56:35.680]  We own them all, okay?
[56:35.680 --> 56:39.560]  The thing is, is that this thing is so close, here's his time period.
[56:39.560 --> 56:41.960]  He is extremely worried, okay?
[56:41.960 --> 56:45.560]  He said he is extremely worried about the next 90 days.
[56:45.560 --> 56:46.560]  Everything is taking place.
[56:46.560 --> 56:47.960]  The Middle East plays into this.
[56:47.960 --> 56:49.920]  Everything is taking place in the currency.
[56:49.920 --> 56:55.280]  I asked him flat ass out, forgive the language, but I said, look, I got to have this from
[56:55.280 --> 56:57.320]  you guys and be able to verify it.
[56:57.320 --> 57:03.360]  Is the Amaro really coming on board or is that just another thing to keep us occupied
[57:03.360 --> 57:05.880]  and just go directly to casual society?
[57:05.880 --> 57:06.880]  He said no.
[57:06.880 --> 57:10.960]  And by the way, I've had multiple verifications, although people say, oh, the Amaro, it's
[57:10.960 --> 57:11.960]  not printed.
[57:11.960 --> 57:18.000]  They might have demanded 1.3 trillion Amaros, which the Bush regime gave to them, or they
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.800]  would basically cancel and crash our currency.
[57:21.800 --> 57:23.840]  Now let's explain what that is.
[57:23.840 --> 57:30.120]  They announced a month ago in the New York Times that the Federal Reserve is issuing
[57:30.120 --> 57:36.360]  something above Treasury notes itself that is collateralized by North American assets.
[57:36.360 --> 57:37.920]  So that's your Amaro.
[57:37.920 --> 57:43.360]  That is a above the stock market, above the bond market, international currency cashless
[57:43.360 --> 57:44.760]  above gold.
[57:44.760 --> 57:45.760]  Stay there.
[57:45.760 --> 57:46.760]  Steve Cuell is our guest.
[57:46.760 --> 57:51.520]  Transmission continues.
[57:51.520 --> 57:54.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[57:54.000 --> 58:00.120]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:00.120 --> 58:05.760]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground Sierra
[58:05.760 --> 58:09.280]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[58:09.280 --> 58:14.560]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[58:14.560 --> 58:16.160]  to tell their story.
[58:16.160 --> 58:25.160]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[58:25.160 --> 58:29.920]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world
[58:29.920 --> 58:32.200]  take action against their global masters.
[58:32.200 --> 58:35.200]  He had his hand in over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[58:35.200 --> 58:41.200]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[58:41.200 --> 58:44.680]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[58:44.680 --> 58:50.520]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order
[58:50.520 --> 58:53.200]  the DVD at infowars.com.
[58:53.200 --> 58:56.880]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[58:56.880 --> 59:02.360]  and bring in martial law.
[59:02.360 --> 59:04.600]  Waging war on corruption.
[59:04.600 --> 59:14.280]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:14.280 --> 59:19.080]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[59:19.080 --> 59:20.080]  You want answers?
[59:20.080 --> 59:22.200]  Well, so does he.
[59:22.200 --> 59:31.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[59:31.240 --> 59:39.200]  We've got 30 minutes left with Steve Quayle, SteveQuayle.com, the Q-Files, Dr. Paul Craig
[59:39.200 --> 59:41.240]  Roberts and David Ike joining us.
[59:41.240 --> 59:49.080]  Okay, Steve, continuing, just from your own study, not just this other source, your perspective
[59:49.080 --> 59:52.000]  on how they will trigger some of the stage threats.
[59:52.000 --> 59:58.440]  Is it suitcase nukes carried out by the globalist blamed on Russia to start World War III?
[59:58.440 --> 1:00:01.480]  Everything Tom Clancy puts out basically comes true.
[1:00:01.480 --> 1:00:08.320]  Six years ago, we put out a video game where NATO runs a sneak attack into South Ossetia
[1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:15.080]  to start a conflict that then in 2011 and 2012 leads to a nuclear war.
[1:00:15.080 --> 1:00:18.960]  Now they put out the end war game where all of this happens and then world government
[1:00:18.960 --> 1:00:19.960]  comes out of it.
[1:00:19.960 --> 1:00:22.560]  They love this predictive programming.
[1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:24.440]  Or is it the economic collapse?
[1:00:24.440 --> 1:00:27.120]  Is it conventional stage terror attacks?
[1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:29.840]  Is it a wider war and attack on Iran?
[1:00:29.840 --> 1:00:30.840]  What do you see unfolding?
[1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:35.200]  I see all of the above and let me, first of all, take the suitcase nukes thing.
[1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:40.920]  Alex, that's what launched me on my radio career 15 years ago because after the situation
[1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:45.280]  with Russia and the whole glass nose, perestroika, the Berlin Wall.
[1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:46.280]  Alexander Lebed.
[1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:47.280]  You got it.
[1:00:47.280 --> 1:00:50.800]  Alexander Lebed, by the way, I was in the process and I'm not saying he was murdered
[1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:52.680]  because I was trying to interview him.
[1:00:52.680 --> 1:00:58.000]  But when Lebed testified or Lebed testified before the Walden Committee, he was telling
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  me exactly what's happened.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:04.240]  I actually talked to different people that were arms brokers from that part of the world,
[1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:05.240]  especially Eastern Europe.
[1:01:05.240 --> 1:01:09.320]  And when I say you could get anything you want, you could get the deal handled in Vienna,
[1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:12.040]  you could basically go to any of the stands.
[1:01:12.040 --> 1:01:17.360]  And those days, the go in price for what would be called a suitcase nukes is 5 million bucks.
[1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:23.000]  Now what was fascinating, when I interviewed different black market guys that were selling
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.160]  this stuff, I mean, the typical statement would go, oh, we can get you whatever you
[1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:27.160]  want.
[1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:28.160]  Let us see the color of your money.
[1:01:28.160 --> 1:01:30.440]  Once we see the color of your money, we will be friends.
[1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:33.560]  Once we have your money, we will be very good friends and you will be very happy.
[1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:35.080]  That's a liberal conversation.
[1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:39.760]  The thing is, is that what I don't think people understand is it's not the argument.
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:43.520]  See, every time I used to talk about suitcase nukes in America, the CIA would flood out
[1:01:43.520 --> 1:01:49.320]  their specific mouthpiece and say, oh, those things don't exist, Alexander Lebed was murdered.
[1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:50.320]  He was called a Dave.
[1:01:50.320 --> 1:01:55.920]  Well, I mean, our side of the oldest model was a Davy Crockett and there's all sorts
[1:01:55.920 --> 1:01:56.920]  of strategic names.
[1:01:56.920 --> 1:02:01.080]  But listen, it's way beyond that now, because again, when the whole thing came out with
[1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:05.000]  Red Mercury, I was the first guy to interview Sam Cohen, the inventor of the neutron bomb,
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  okay?
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:09.920]  When I would talk about Red Mercury and not the stuff that was trying to be sold on eBay,
[1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:14.480]  that was basically Mercury with a dye in it, but Red Mercury is an atomic, if you will,
[1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:20.760]  it's got to be put into a reactor, it's a mercury antimony oxide, I mean, it's an atomic
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:21.760]  byproduct.
[1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:23.320]  It comes out of a nuclear pile.
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:24.560]  Yes, it does.
[1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:28.800]  But I mean, here you've got, I've got the inventor of the neutron bomb, by the way, telling
[1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:33.440]  me that the United States government gave that to China, courtesy of George Bush Sr.,
[1:02:33.440 --> 1:02:37.320]  the inventor of the neutron bomb was present when the design for the neutron bomb was given
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:38.320]  to China.
[1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:43.640]  But he told me, he said, Steve, I interviewed Sam Cohen, I think eight times, and had massive
[1:02:43.640 --> 1:02:49.600]  conversations with him off air, and here's the thing, Alex, this is no longer old vintage
[1:02:49.600 --> 1:02:56.160]  nuclear weapons that have to be, you know, kept up batteries, all that stuff, you know,
[1:02:56.160 --> 1:03:01.280]  the thorium and all the different byproducts, or excuse me, different products that have
[1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:03.080]  to be used in the fission reaction.
[1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:08.280]  When I talk to guys who are what we call the mighty men and women of Valor, and they tell
[1:03:08.280 --> 1:03:12.080]  me, you know, I was told, why would anybody tell you this stuff, simple?
[1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:15.480]  Because I'm trying to tell it like it is, I'm trying to warn people like it is like
[1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:20.440]  you are, and you know, I can't tell you how many of those devices have been disarmed in
[1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:21.440]  the United States.
[1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:22.920]  People said I was fully, you know what?
[1:03:22.920 --> 1:03:28.680]  But then they could not deny the seismic tracings of, gee, why did all that seismic activity
[1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:31.840]  happen on July 15th, you know, a number of years ago?
[1:03:31.840 --> 1:03:35.960]  The point is, is what I'm trying to say is this, we are so mind controlled that you and
[1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:43.480]  I could present living actual testimony, and you know, the CIA already ran a study on this
[1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:48.000]  and said only 46% of Americans would see it if they thought, believe it, if they thought
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  with their own eyes.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  Stay there.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  46%.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:55.520]  I want to talk more about neutron weapons, because of course this is a radiation burst,
[1:03:55.520 --> 1:04:01.600]  not a hot flash air burst, and it kills all living creatures in a certain area that doesn't
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:03.320]  damage the infrastructure.
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:07.200]  The British Ministry of Defense said now a year and a half ago in their public report
[1:04:07.200 --> 1:04:10.560]  we'll tell you when we get back.
[1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:12.160]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:16.000]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  important than ever.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.800]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:26.680]  You'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:29.160]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[1:04:29.160 --> 1:04:34.920]  Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[1:04:34.920 --> 1:04:36.760]  They turned off the telephones and emailed.
[1:04:36.760 --> 1:04:40.800]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:43.560]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[1:04:43.560 --> 1:04:47.880]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and
[1:04:47.880 --> 1:04:52.680]  blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond many Americans' reach.
[1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:56.800]  In pre-Nazi Germany's super inflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two
[1:04:56.800 --> 1:04:59.840]  days until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[1:04:59.840 --> 1:05:04.200]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:08.240]  The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing to loan grocery stores enough
[1:05:08.240 --> 1:05:09.880]  money to restock their shelves.
[1:05:09.880 --> 1:05:13.360]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[1:05:13.360 --> 1:05:16.760]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:18.320]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[1:05:18.320 --> 1:05:22.360]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[1:05:22.360 --> 1:05:26.520]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[1:05:26.520 --> 1:05:29.760]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having
[1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:33.840]  a supply of storeable food, the government, the new old order has a lot less control over
[1:05:33.840 --> 1:05:37.960]  you, and so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[1:05:37.960 --> 1:05:41.200]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:45.600]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from E. coli,
[1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:49.880]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the cost of
[1:05:49.880 --> 1:05:51.480]  last year's grocery prices.
[1:05:51.480 --> 1:05:56.280]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:02.960]  foods they have to offer.

[1:06:14.360 --> 1:06:15.360]  Take action today.
[1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:18.840]  The first step is getting storeable food.
[1:06:18.840 --> 1:06:24.800]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:29.800]  a war on for your mind.
[1:06:29.800 --> 1:06:41.280]  Ian Fleming, who was a member of MI6, OSS before that, who founded our CIA, his second
[1:06:41.280 --> 1:06:49.800]  book was Moon Raker, written back in the 50s, and then it was turned into a movie in the
[1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:57.280]  70s with Roger Moore, where an evil mastermind over an international banking cartel wants
[1:06:57.280 --> 1:07:01.560]  to release a biological weapon to kill all humans on Earth, but then it phases out in
[1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:02.560]  a year.
[1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:05.040]  They're going to live on a space station while we all die.
[1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:10.720]  Well, again, they throw it in our face in popular culture, like before 9-11, Fox Television,
[1:07:10.720 --> 1:07:16.280]  and I even had one of the stars of the show, the X-Files Lone Gunman, Dean Haglin, call
[1:07:16.280 --> 1:07:18.000]  me and say, I want to come meet with you.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:21.720]  And this guy was scared, and we interviewed him at my house, that video's up on President
[1:07:21.720 --> 1:07:22.720]  Planet.tv.
[1:07:22.720 --> 1:07:26.920]  And he said, listen, the CIA came and planted these plots on us.
[1:07:26.920 --> 1:07:31.120]  Six months before 9-11, the secret group in the government, above the government, hijacks
[1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:36.640]  a jet by remote control, uses an anti-terror drill to make NORAD stand down, telling him
[1:07:36.640 --> 1:07:42.560]  it's a drill, to fly a jet, a large passenger jet in the World Trade Center, as a pretext
[1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:44.280]  to attack Afghanistan.
[1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:49.240]  Now, of course, Tom Plancy also wrote a book about something similar.
[1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:54.120]  They do this predictive programming to mix reality with unreality to prepare the subconscious
[1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:55.120]  mind.
[1:07:55.120 --> 1:08:00.680]  Now, that said, going back to Moon Raker, with the elites planned to kill us, they could
[1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:04.600]  use biological, they could use chemical, they're using soft kill on us right now with the chemtrails
[1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:07.760]  and this fluoride and the mercury.
[1:08:07.760 --> 1:08:14.080]  We had Dr. Blaylock, the top brain surgeon on breaking all this down last Friday.
[1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:18.280]  One of their plans, and this is even alluded to in the British Ministry of Defense report
[1:08:18.280 --> 1:08:23.000]  for the 10-year trend, what they believe will happen, they said governments will use neutron
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.400]  weapons to control their populations.
[1:08:25.400 --> 1:08:28.760]  Because if we were to try to rebel, the military would try to rebel and take over Washington
[1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:32.880]  and restore the Constitution, the black-up government will use neutron bombs to kill
[1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:33.880]  them.
[1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:34.880]  That is stated.
[1:08:34.880 --> 1:08:38.600]  Now, they can't stop us taking over all the other cities peacefully and politically saying,
[1:08:38.600 --> 1:08:42.640]  no, and pointing out that we know you're planning to use neutron weapons, then they really can't
[1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:45.120]  do it because politically it would expose them.
[1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:50.840]  But that's the level of total full-spectrum dominance is the term they're using.
[1:08:50.840 --> 1:08:54.360]  And everybody in Northcom needs to know you're working for people at the highest levels above
[1:08:54.360 --> 1:08:56.360]  you who are planning this.
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:57.360]  Steve Cuell comments.
[1:08:57.360 --> 1:08:58.360]  Absolutely.
[1:08:58.360 --> 1:09:03.240]  And the situation that's gone on, if it hadn't been for some pretty amazing people in your
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:09.320]  area, that as you know, Austin just, you know, the central hub for a lot of special operations
[1:09:09.320 --> 1:09:14.320]  and everything, if it hadn't been for some of the bravest men and women, Alex, we'd already
[1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:15.320]  been there.
[1:09:15.320 --> 1:09:17.600]  Let me talk about the dissemination of neutron weapons.
[1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:21.080]  It is a neutron weapon killed by an intense radiation burst.
[1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:26.200]  It does not have the standard thermal signature and doesn't have the fallout, which is debris
[1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:31.240]  that's basically blown up in the upper atmosphere that becomes radioactive and falls out.
[1:09:31.240 --> 1:09:35.320]  And you know, you can take a baseball size, actually a softball size weapon device and
[1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:38.000]  kill everything within one square mile.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:45.240]  But the thing that I don't think people recognize, now supposedly George Bush, the father, took
[1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:47.280]  our neutron weapons out of our arsenal.
[1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:49.120]  I don't believe that for a minute.
[1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:52.680]  And given the fact that we've got the situation now going where this stuff is in the hands
[1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:56.560]  of terrorists and everything else is basically, when I say terrorists, I'm talking about the
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:09:57.560]  Illuminati.
[1:09:57.560 --> 1:09:58.560]  I want to make that clear.
[1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:03.280]  Yeah, like it's literally chaos, I mean, it's literally chaos.
[1:10:03.280 --> 1:10:07.280]  But let me tell you what this guy said, because again, when I get someone that I run into,
[1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:09.120]  you know, I basically tried to be a watch.
[1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:11.240]  I tried to warn, warn, warn, warn, warn.
[1:10:11.240 --> 1:10:12.240]  It's Specter.
[1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:13.240]  It's Specter.
[1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:14.240]  Go ahead.
[1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:15.240]  The bottom line is there.
[1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:21.160]  He, the gentleman I had the meeting with, is really worried about a severe biological
[1:10:21.160 --> 1:10:25.040]  attack that's going to be launched upon the United States by...
[1:10:25.040 --> 1:10:28.080]  And they just announced confirmed bird flu deaths in China.
[1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:29.080]  Yep.
[1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:30.080]  Now let me share this with you.
[1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:34.280]  I got a call from a homicide detective in Central US, okay?
[1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:39.200]  He said that one of his men, one of his lead detectives, homicide detective, was a National
[1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:40.200]  Guard.
[1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:45.600]  He was at a meeting and a general was brought in from Washington to discuss what's getting
[1:10:45.600 --> 1:10:47.080]  ready to happen.
[1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:51.440]  And he talked about the biological event, by the way, this man's police department was
[1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:55.560]  called, given the biogear and everything, but it was in the heartland, okay?
[1:10:55.560 --> 1:10:59.360]  And his exact words, I can't say it on the radio, but he said, if the American people
[1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:05.960]  understood all the deadly fecal contaminant we're going to throw at them, they'd absolutely
[1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:07.360]  die on their feet.
[1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:09.640]  So this is kind of weird, okay?
[1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:13.360]  And he, you know, obviously a lot of people are used to such brash talk.
[1:11:13.360 --> 1:11:15.760]  Here's what I'm saying, Alex, it's no longer...
[1:11:15.760 --> 1:11:20.160]  There's no more time left for people just to be spectators, just to basically get on
[1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:21.680]  a board and say, well, what did Alex say?
[1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:22.680]  What did Steve say?
[1:11:22.680 --> 1:11:23.680]  They've got to get involved.
[1:11:23.680 --> 1:11:24.680]  They've got to buy the tapes.
[1:11:24.680 --> 1:11:29.000]  And when I say this, your tapes have gone round the world, okay?
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:33.240]  And the thing that people don't understand is if we do on a shoestring budget, what these
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:38.360]  guys do with $9 trillion, by the way, all that money that was put into the banking system,
[1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:42.880]  I know one of the largest gold traders in the world, he sells in metric tons and hundreds
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:43.880]  of metric tons.
[1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:49.000]  He told me all that money is being filtered out of the banks through the Orient into gold.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:54.160]  And I can tell you this, based on his receipts and my verification of what he's done, he
[1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:58.720]  has told me, so by the way, the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, here's something no
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:04.120]  one knows, it'll be turned into now, has been turned into the International Monetary Authority.
[1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:07.840]  So when all the paper currencies crash, these guys are all saying, well, look, we got all
[1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:10.280]  the gold, we're going to issue a currency that's gold-based.
[1:12:10.280 --> 1:12:12.960]  This goes beyond the Emerald, this goes beyond the Euro.
[1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:17.920]  But before that, total chaos, you and I have talked about it, screamed about it, you filmed
[1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:22.680]  about it, I've written about it, but the point is they want total chaos and out of that chaos
[1:12:22.680 --> 1:12:25.720]  will arise of the Phoenix or the New World Order.
[1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:31.440]  But in the meantime, when I get people from all branches of the military, when I get people
[1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:37.360]  from all branches of government, when I get people, former Secretaries of State, Assistant
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:42.040]  Secretaries of State, all these different people telling me the same stuff and coming
[1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:46.840]  so fast and furious that some of them, by the way, have left the country, the point is
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:51.840]  is that there's so little time for people to just say, well, I need more evidence, I
[1:12:51.840 --> 1:12:52.840]  need more evidence.
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:56.800]  And then at night, what you need is Cajonis and you'd better decide that you've got to
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:12:58.680]  use the evidence.
[1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:02.320]  And Alex, it's like everybody's got a set of scales before their eyes.
[1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:06.160]  In one end is all the information you and I and others give them, and then there's this
[1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:07.160]  doubt.
[1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:11.800]  Yeah, instead of looking at the mountains of confirmed in your face admitted that they're
[1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:16.640]  getting ready for martial law and mass arrest and FEMA camps in major papers, they come
[1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:18.760]  and attack us and say we're full of baloney.
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:23.320]  It's Cointel Pro, that's operatives, but it's also weak-minded people who've been conditioned
[1:13:23.320 --> 1:13:25.080]  by the lives and system folks.
[1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:26.080]  It's all happening.
[1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:33.640]  Bloomberg is reporting that a Fed governor by name is saying even local Fed branches
[1:13:33.640 --> 1:13:38.640]  have been told you are under war powers, you can't ask questions, Congress can't ask questions,
[1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:43.920]  and Congress has been told they're under war powers and PDD 51 and the John Warner Defense
[1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:48.960]  Authorization Act states the states, the Congress, the judicial has no power, it's
[1:13:48.960 --> 1:13:52.240]  of course criminal to do this, it's illegitimate, but they're doing it, that it's all under
[1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:56.440]  the executive and the executive, whether it's George Bush or Barack H. Obama, is controlled
[1:13:56.440 --> 1:13:59.460]  by the internationalists openly by the world banks.
[1:13:59.460 --> 1:14:01.000]  They are taking us down.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:02.800]  This is a corporate receivership.
[1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:07.520]  Now, you talk about people on the system stopping it, and I know that people with leaks and
[1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:12.840]  info and things that are just amazing, that people have gone through to stop this and
[1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:17.400]  back it off and to warn people, that's why 20, 30 years ago, everything that's now declassified,
[1:14:17.400 --> 1:14:21.680]  the old timers who were always colonels or generals retired would say, we funded Mao,
[1:14:21.680 --> 1:14:24.640]  we put Mao in, now it's on History Channel, they admit it.
[1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:29.040]  There's a plan to put you in FEMA camp, there's a plan to exterminate you, now it's declassified.
[1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:33.200]  They were there, they were brief, that's why they warned us, that's why the right wing
[1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:38.920]  patriot militia people formed, because we had good patriots in government that did warn
[1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:43.680]  us, are there ways to stop this, or is this going to happen?
[1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:48.280]  It's going to happen, but the way it's going to happen, first of all, it's going to happen
[1:14:48.280 --> 1:14:50.000]  at such an accelerated pace.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:53.960]  You asked me if it's going to be financial, it's going to be Russia, China, all of the
[1:14:53.960 --> 1:14:54.960]  above.
[1:14:54.960 --> 1:15:00.360]  Right now, obviously you know that good night, Lebanon, rockets have been fired into northern
[1:15:00.360 --> 1:15:01.680]  Israel from Lebanon.
[1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:04.360]  And Israel's been responding and saying they may invade, yeah.
[1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:08.200]  Yeah, and see, the thing is, this is all scripted, this is something that I don't think, you
[1:15:08.200 --> 1:15:13.240]  know, Alex, you referred to Tom Clancy, I remember going public with all of the science
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:17.680]  fiction producers in Hollywood that had been contacted by the CIA.
[1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:21.720]  That's why you have Steven Spielberg having the largest collection, and I'm not going
[1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:26.280]  to go there, but Alien Artifacts, you've got the former Star Trek head Gene Roddenberry
[1:15:26.280 --> 1:15:32.320]  being basically the guy that was so tied in, and I had one of the CIA's top agents, double
[1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:33.320]  agents, tell me.
[1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:37.160]  Well, I mean, he was the heir, he was the heir apparent to Aleister Crowley and ran the
[1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:38.240]  OTO.
[1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:39.240]  You got it.
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:41.080]  And then the head of the jet propulsion system, yeah.
[1:15:41.080 --> 1:15:45.000]  Yeah, but when you and I talk about that stuff, see, what we've got to get now is we've got
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:49.400]  to get people to absolutely, can I tell you something, you've given bits and pieces, you've
[1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:54.960]  given the borders, I sometimes you take, it takes an obscure piece, all the pieces fit
[1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:59.880]  now, Alex, and it's their timing, this biological event, that's the thing that they're going
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:04.400]  to do, because let me share this with you, on their level of terror, they have it all
[1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:10.920]  so psychologically computerized, they know that a bio event carries 10 times the weight
[1:16:10.920 --> 1:16:11.920]  of a nuclear event.
[1:16:11.920 --> 1:16:15.040]  War games, it makes everybody isolate, it makes everybody freeze.
[1:16:15.040 --> 1:16:18.000]  Right, panic and terror, and they put them right in their spot.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:22.440]  By the way, when I asked the question, I did not get answered, is on the black box jammers,
[1:16:22.440 --> 1:16:24.840]  will they shut down all newer vehicles too?
[1:16:24.840 --> 1:16:29.920]  As you know, the police have different electromagnetic type things that they can shut the ignitions
[1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:31.840]  down on newer cars.
[1:16:31.840 --> 1:16:36.880]  I do not know that these black box jammers that are the broad spectrum jammers will do
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:41.480]  that, but I know they also have those, so the critical thing that everyone needs to
[1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:46.840]  know is, look, how many times we told everybody, our listeners, mutual listeners, the interviews
[1:16:46.840 --> 1:16:47.840]  we've done.
[1:16:47.840 --> 1:16:51.080]  You didn't just say, I remember you 10 years ago, you didn't just say we'd have an economic
[1:16:51.080 --> 1:16:54.680]  collapse, you said it would be triggered by the derivatives, by design, and that's what
[1:16:54.680 --> 1:16:55.680]  happened.
[1:16:55.680 --> 1:17:00.920]  Absolutely, and I'm sure you get tired of the same old critics, I'm going to tell you
[1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:05.880]  people that are on boards, that are on blocks, the people that rise up when they're attacking
[1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:08.920]  the messenger, I ask them, I say, well, what's your pay grade?
[1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:11.120]  And they say, well, what do you mean what's your pay grade?
[1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:13.280]  You obviously work for them.
[1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:17.360]  And I can tell you this, the thing that most people want to be able to do, most normal human
[1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:21.600]  beings want to be able to provide for their family security, provide for their safety.
[1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:23.440]  I know you, you're tired of the blood.
[1:17:23.440 --> 1:17:27.400]  Yeah, the people that are the people that are serving the New World Order are destroying
[1:17:27.400 --> 1:17:28.400]  their own future.
[1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:32.040]  They're living in their own house down, and I don't think they understand just how horrific
[1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:33.480]  the final in game is.
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:34.480]  They have no idea.
[1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:38.240]  Let me tell you this, I'm going to say this, and so all of the billionaires that you're
[1:17:38.240 --> 1:17:42.160]  seeing getting whacked, okay, it doesn't matter if it's Merkel in Germany.
[1:17:42.160 --> 1:17:44.040]  These guys are not committing suicide.
[1:17:44.040 --> 1:17:47.400]  That's right, I've got a stack of billionaires being killed.
[1:17:47.400 --> 1:17:51.720]  Right, and here's what the word came to me from Beijing, okay?
[1:17:51.720 --> 1:17:55.960]  The Beijing said that trillionaires are wiping out the billionaires, and the guy said to me,
[1:17:55.960 --> 1:17:59.440]  he said, guess who the trillionaires are, Steve, I said, easy, it's the puppet masters.
[1:17:59.440 --> 1:18:03.000]  They don't want any ability to contest them.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:06.480]  They let them get filled up only long enough to destroy them and take down.
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:09.160]  Yeah, they killed one of the richest guys in Germany.
[1:18:09.160 --> 1:18:10.160]  That's actually in my stack.
[1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:13.400]  We'll mention that when we get back with Steve Quayle final segment, Steve, I got to have
[1:18:13.400 --> 1:18:14.880]  you back up in the near future.
[1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:19.440]  We're heading into the quickening right now, SteveQuayle.com, stay with us.
[1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:20.440]  You worry.
[1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:22.400]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:25.040]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:27.220]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[1:18:27.220 --> 1:18:28.920]  Your answer may be at hand.
[1:18:28.920 --> 1:18:32.400]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land isolated from civilization.
[1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:36.440]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over
[1:18:36.440 --> 1:18:37.840]  God's green earth.
[1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:41.560]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[1:18:41.560 --> 1:18:43.460]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[1:18:43.460 --> 1:18:46.200]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:49.720]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[1:18:49.720 --> 1:18:54.080]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards
[1:18:54.080 --> 1:18:58.400]  and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality and joy.

[1:19:16.240 --> 1:19:18.440]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[1:19:18.440 --> 1:19:22.000]  Hi, John Huber from Midas Resources.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:24.920]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[1:19:24.920 --> 1:19:28.600]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess
[1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:33.520]  of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[1:19:33.520 --> 1:19:37.200]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:41.760]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:43.840]  How much are you willing to lose?
[1:19:43.840 --> 1:19:44.840]  Take action now.

[1:19:53.640 --> 1:19:57.120]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[1:19:57.120 --> 1:20:01.240]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for
[1:20:01.240 --> 1:20:03.920]  the United States to be the next target.
[1:20:03.920 --> 1:20:09.600]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.

[1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:23.440]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:20:23.440 --> 1:20:28.040]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:34.040]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:37.200]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:43.120]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:20:43.120 --> 1:20:47.560]  of humanity is at hand.
[1:20:47.560 --> 1:20:53.040]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:20:53.040 --> 1:20:56.960]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:20:56.960 --> 1:20:59.560]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:20:59.560 --> 1:21:00.560]  Most people have no idea.
[1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:01.560]  They're not after money.
[1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:02.560]  They have all the money they need.
[1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:03.560]  They're after power.
[1:21:03.560 --> 1:21:04.560]  That's their affidavit.

[1:21:16.320 --> 1:21:18.160]  You have been warned.
[1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:23.880]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around
[1:21:23.880 --> 1:21:27.440]  the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[1:21:27.440 --> 1:21:31.840]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic
[1:21:31.840 --> 1:21:35.520]  diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:40.040]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:42.920]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[1:21:42.920 --> 1:21:47.640]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally
[1:21:47.640 --> 1:21:53.080]  and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite
[1:21:53.080 --> 1:21:54.400]  beverage once a day.

[1:23:28.880 --> 1:23:31.120]  the book of revelations written about,
[1:23:31.120 --> 1:23:32.960]  and I make no apologies.
[1:23:32.960 --> 1:23:34.680]  People have got to get their hearts right,
[1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:36.360]  which is because this thing is not only
[1:23:36.360 --> 1:23:38.760]  in the natural realm, it's in the supernatural realm.
[1:23:38.760 --> 1:23:42.020]  Alex, you've spent so much of your time and effort
[1:23:42.020 --> 1:23:44.660]  in your documentary about the Bohemian Grove.
[1:23:44.660 --> 1:23:47.180]  There are guys that are absolutely
[1:23:47.180 --> 1:23:50.540]  blood-sacrificing Luciferians
[1:23:50.540 --> 1:23:55.540]  who offer live children to incredibly evil entities,
[1:23:55.800 --> 1:23:57.540]  and these are the rulers and leaders of the world.
[1:23:57.540 --> 1:23:59.680]  I want to say something about gun control too.
[1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:01.960]  The bottom line is anyone that will take your gun
[1:24:01.960 --> 1:24:03.180]  will take your life.
[1:24:03.180 --> 1:24:04.020]  Oh my gosh.
[1:24:04.020 --> 1:24:05.720]  And people had better, I'm making that statement.
[1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:06.560]  Don't get mad at Alex.
[1:24:06.560 --> 1:24:07.820]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:24:07.820 --> 1:24:11.260]  I just freaked out because I am so conditioned
[1:24:11.260 --> 1:24:13.580]  and so ready for our guns to be taken
[1:24:13.580 --> 1:24:15.540]  that I forgot they have introduced a bill
[1:24:15.540 --> 1:24:18.640]  the Democrats have to totally ban guns,
[1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:20.940]  and I read the bill last night and couldn't believe it.
[1:24:20.940 --> 1:24:24.180]  Kurt Nemo did a story at infowars.com,
[1:24:24.180 --> 1:24:25.820]  and I hadn't even covered that.
[1:24:25.820 --> 1:24:27.520]  I knew I was forgetting to cover something.
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:30.100]  I mean, Steve, we're being hit so fast here.
[1:24:30.100 --> 1:24:32.260]  Right, and I gotta say this, and I've said this,
[1:24:32.260 --> 1:24:34.860]  and I've been told this, I've been told this by
[1:24:34.860 --> 1:24:39.420]  multi, multi, numerous, too many sources.
[1:24:39.420 --> 1:24:41.900]  I mean, and generals and admirals,
[1:24:41.900 --> 1:24:44.140]  I don't know through friends of mine,
[1:24:44.140 --> 1:24:45.580]  but they all say the same thing.
[1:24:45.580 --> 1:24:48.700]  The bottom line is this thing's gonna get really bad,
[1:24:48.700 --> 1:24:49.540]  stay out of it.
[1:24:49.540 --> 1:24:50.660]  By the way, there's gonna be a fight.
[1:24:50.660 --> 1:24:51.980]  There's been a fight going on in the military.
[1:24:51.980 --> 1:24:53.380]  You know, I talk about that and people say,
[1:24:53.380 --> 1:24:54.460]  oh, how would he know?
[1:24:54.460 --> 1:24:56.500]  Well, obviously I can't know unless someone tells you.
[1:24:56.500 --> 1:24:58.740]  Wait a minute, there was an Army Times article
[1:24:58.740 --> 1:25:01.420]  that the military, they do a poll every year,
[1:25:01.420 --> 1:25:03.980]  is the most unhappy with the federal government
[1:25:03.980 --> 1:25:06.060]  in its history, even more than Vietnam.
[1:25:06.060 --> 1:25:07.780]  And they don't trust Obama.
[1:25:07.780 --> 1:25:10.380]  And the thing is, remember how the Marines greeted Obama
[1:25:10.380 --> 1:25:11.500]  with silence.
[1:25:11.500 --> 1:25:13.780]  That's why he wants a civilian police force.
[1:25:13.780 --> 1:25:17.180]  I equally armed to equal the military.
[1:25:17.180 --> 1:25:19.500]  Look, there are some wonderful people.
[1:25:19.500 --> 1:25:21.580]  I owe my life, you owe your life.
[1:25:21.580 --> 1:25:24.500]  We don't know all of our lives we owe,
[1:25:24.500 --> 1:25:27.660]  and literally to some pretty amazing people
[1:25:27.660 --> 1:25:29.860]  that at one time were located out of Austin.
[1:25:29.860 --> 1:25:33.340]  Well, wait a minute, we know that just six months ago,
[1:25:33.340 --> 1:25:37.460]  Fox Fallon had a design for refusing to stage terror attacks
[1:25:37.460 --> 1:25:39.660]  and that it was military that refused,
[1:25:39.660 --> 1:25:42.420]  the Navy SEALs refused to stage terror attacks
[1:25:42.420 --> 1:25:44.660]  on our Navy ships for Dick Cheney.
[1:25:44.660 --> 1:25:45.740]  Absolutely.
[1:25:45.740 --> 1:25:48.940]  And I can tell you this, that when Black Ops A,
[1:25:48.940 --> 1:25:51.180]  fight Black Ops B, people die.
[1:25:51.180 --> 1:25:53.900]  And it's usually written off as a training accident.
[1:25:53.900 --> 1:25:55.500]  Again, Alex, this is something
[1:25:55.500 --> 1:25:57.020]  that I don't think people understand.
[1:25:57.020 --> 1:25:59.220]  What makes me, I gotta be careful here,
[1:25:59.220 --> 1:26:02.380]  what makes me furious is that these men and women
[1:26:02.380 --> 1:26:05.180]  are some of the bravest and they are some of the most
[1:26:05.180 --> 1:26:08.820]  absolutely, when I say invisible to the natural eye,
[1:26:08.820 --> 1:26:12.180]  they have to fight in secret, they die in secret,
[1:26:12.180 --> 1:26:15.180]  and their motto is that we all might live.
[1:26:15.180 --> 1:26:17.500]  And I wanna say to those men and women,
[1:26:17.500 --> 1:26:19.420]  I don't know if they're at Alpha site or wherever,
[1:26:19.420 --> 1:26:21.380]  but God bless you, thank you.
[1:26:21.380 --> 1:26:23.340]  There are a whole bunch of intercessors out there
[1:26:23.340 --> 1:26:25.260]  praying for the mighty men and women of valor
[1:26:25.260 --> 1:26:27.260]  and the entire military that took an oath
[1:26:27.260 --> 1:26:29.100]  to defend the Constitution of the United States
[1:26:29.100 --> 1:26:31.300]  and are not gonna roll over and let the demons
[1:26:31.300 --> 1:26:34.420]  and these devils from hell, just simply obliterate.
[1:26:34.420 --> 1:26:36.940]  And that's why they're bringing in foreign troops.
[1:26:36.940 --> 1:26:39.540]  And I remember it was in the mainstream AP
[1:26:39.540 --> 1:26:42.060]  a couple years ago that they're not just hiring foreigners,
[1:26:42.060 --> 1:26:43.820]  they're hiring aggravated felons.
[1:26:43.820 --> 1:26:45.860]  That means violent, arsonist, rapist.
[1:26:45.860 --> 1:26:49.180]  That was in the news, Washington Times and AP.
[1:26:49.180 --> 1:26:50.660]  People cannot believe this,
[1:26:50.660 --> 1:26:53.420]  they're replacing everybody with crooks and nuts
[1:26:53.420 --> 1:26:55.700]  and psychopaths and low IQ people.
[1:26:56.700 --> 1:26:58.140]  This is such a battle coming up.
[1:26:58.140 --> 1:26:59.660]  Folks, find out more about Steve Quayle
[1:26:59.660 --> 1:27:02.780]  at SteveQuayle.com, SteveQuayle.com
[1:27:02.780 --> 1:27:05.100]  and all the great books and materials and information
[1:27:05.100 --> 1:27:05.980]  and we should support him.
[1:27:05.980 --> 1:27:07.500]  I wanna get you back up if you'll do it
[1:27:07.500 --> 1:27:09.100]  in the next few weeks for two hours
[1:27:09.100 --> 1:27:10.220]  so we can take phone call, Steve.
[1:27:10.220 --> 1:27:11.900]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[1:27:11.900 --> 1:27:13.500]  Thanks, Alex, bye-bye.
[1:27:13.500 --> 1:27:14.660]  God bless you, sir.
[1:27:14.660 --> 1:27:18.180]  Okay, we've got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts coming up
[1:27:18.180 --> 1:27:21.260]  in the next segment and then David Ike.
[1:27:21.260 --> 1:27:24.580]  Speaking of getting the word out, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:27:24.580 --> 1:27:26.180]  the number one thing you can do
[1:27:26.180 --> 1:27:28.900]  is not buy the books and videos off infowars.com.
[1:27:28.900 --> 1:27:30.100]  That's important to support us
[1:27:30.100 --> 1:27:31.420]  and to get the films and make copies
[1:27:31.420 --> 1:27:33.500]  of in-game terrorist warmen, things like that.
[1:27:33.500 --> 1:27:35.820]  The most important thing to do is to tell your email list,
[1:27:35.820 --> 1:27:38.700]  your MySpace, your church, print up flyers,
[1:27:38.700 --> 1:27:41.780]  your business work, your neighbors
[1:27:41.780 --> 1:27:43.700]  and tell them about infowars.com
[1:27:43.700 --> 1:27:45.940]  and the radio show, wherever you are in the world
[1:27:45.940 --> 1:27:47.540]  on the internet, you can listen to the free podcast,
[1:27:47.540 --> 1:27:49.980]  you can subscribe to in the listen page
[1:27:49.980 --> 1:27:51.580]  and or on the local AM and FM's
[1:27:51.580 --> 1:27:53.980]  you're listening to us on right now, stop at red lights,
[1:27:53.980 --> 1:27:55.900]  tell people, hey, tune in to this station
[1:27:55.900 --> 1:27:58.140]  or that station, this AM, that FM.
[1:27:58.140 --> 1:28:01.820]  It is so important because people are finally listening.
[1:28:02.740 --> 1:28:04.380]  They know we're telling them the truth.
[1:28:04.380 --> 1:28:06.380]  They heard us years ago say this and laughed at us.
[1:28:06.380 --> 1:28:07.460]  Now they've seen it come true.
[1:28:07.460 --> 1:28:09.580]  They're finally listening now is the time when people love.
[1:28:09.580 --> 1:28:13.420]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[1:28:13.420 --> 1:28:16.380]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:28:16.380 --> 1:28:21.180]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply
[1:28:21.180 --> 1:28:22.420]  of electrical power?
[1:28:22.420 --> 1:28:25.060]  If so, this is going to be the most important message
[1:28:25.060 --> 1:28:26.140]  you will ever hear.
[1:28:26.140 --> 1:28:28.300]  Solar power generators are now available
[1:28:28.300 --> 1:28:29.740]  from Solutions from Science,
[1:28:29.740 --> 1:28:32.540]  one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[1:28:32.540 --> 1:28:34.060]  These emergency backup systems
[1:28:34.060 --> 1:28:37.180]  provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[1:28:37.180 --> 1:28:40.300]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly,
[1:28:40.300 --> 1:28:43.220]  emits no fumes and produces electricity for free.
[1:28:43.220 --> 1:28:44.860]  It's like having an electric power plant
[1:28:44.860 --> 1:28:46.620]  running quietly in your own home.
[1:28:46.620 --> 1:28:49.540]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers,
[1:28:49.540 --> 1:28:51.340]  and even keep food from spoiling.
[1:28:51.340 --> 1:28:54.420]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts,
[1:28:54.420 --> 1:28:55.660]  you'll never have to suffer
[1:28:55.660 --> 1:28:57.540]  through painful power outages again.
[1:28:57.540 --> 1:28:59.500]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready
[1:28:59.500 --> 1:29:02.500]  with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[1:29:06.860 --> 1:29:09.700]  That's mysolarbackup.com today

[1:29:17.140 --> 1:29:19.260]  Don't wait, call today.
[1:29:19.260 --> 1:29:21.460]  A day unlike any other in the long course
[1:29:21.460 --> 1:29:22.460]  of American history,
[1:29:22.460 --> 1:29:25.980]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:29:25.980 --> 1:29:28.660]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[1:29:28.660 --> 1:29:30.180]  But who is the enemy?
[1:29:30.180 --> 1:29:31.020]  Bin Laden.
[1:29:31.020 --> 1:29:32.100]  This is his MO.
[1:29:32.100 --> 1:29:33.340]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:29:33.340 --> 1:29:35.340]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:29:35.340 --> 1:29:37.420]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[1:29:37.420 --> 1:29:39.380]  to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[1:29:39.380 --> 1:29:42.420]  to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:29:42.420 --> 1:29:43.900]  Some U.S. investigators believe
[1:29:43.900 --> 1:29:46.460]  that there are Israelis again very much engaged
[1:29:46.460 --> 1:29:49.260]  in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:29:49.260 --> 1:29:53.140]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:29:53.140 --> 1:29:54.900]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[1:29:54.900 --> 1:29:56.860]  the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[1:29:56.860 --> 1:29:58.340]  the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:29:58.340 --> 1:29:59.940]  the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:29:59.940 --> 1:30:01.100]  warnings in war games,
[1:30:01.100 --> 1:30:02.020]  the shadow government,
[1:30:02.020 --> 1:30:03.220]  and much, much more.
[1:30:03.220 --> 1:30:04.500]  Fabled Enemies.
[1:30:04.500 --> 1:30:06.820]  Get the DVD at infowars.com,
[1:30:06.820 --> 1:30:08.660]  or see it in super high quality,
[1:30:08.660 --> 1:30:12.140]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:30:12.140 --> 1:30:14.260]  Either you are with us,
[1:30:14.260 --> 1:30:16.220]  or you are with the terrorists.
[1:30:16.220 --> 1:30:22.100]  Ioniczone.com has the best prices
[1:30:22.100 --> 1:30:24.340]  on commercial shock treatment ozone generators,
[1:30:24.340 --> 1:30:26.620]  starting at $299.
[1:30:26.620 --> 1:30:30.380]  But did you know Ioniczone.com also sells a water ozonator
[1:30:30.380 --> 1:30:33.500]  that some must have for anyone interested in good health?
[1:30:33.500 --> 1:30:34.340]  It's true.
[1:30:34.340 --> 1:30:37.620]  The Ioniczone digital water ozonator features an air intake
[1:30:37.620 --> 1:30:40.500]  and can be fed dry air through the supplied air dryer
[1:30:40.500 --> 1:30:43.340]  or pure oxygen via an oxygen tank.
[1:30:43.340 --> 1:30:46.220]  Ozone fortified water can be used to kill bacteria,
[1:30:46.220 --> 1:30:47.980]  sanitize food, produce,
[1:30:47.980 --> 1:30:50.380]  and eliminates bacteria in the mouth by gargling,
[1:30:50.380 --> 1:30:53.260]  which helps prevent bad breath and even heart disease.
[1:30:53.260 --> 1:30:55.140]  The optional ozone bidet attachment
[1:30:55.140 --> 1:30:56.740]  is used for personal hygiene,
[1:30:56.740 --> 1:30:58.580]  which can kill the bacteria down below
[1:30:58.580 --> 1:31:00.180]  that can lead to irritation.
[1:31:00.180 --> 1:31:03.500]  It's amazing what three atoms of oxygen can do.
[1:31:03.500 --> 1:31:08.500]  Call Ioniczone today at 1-800-549-9535.
[1:31:08.500 --> 1:31:12.740]  That's 1-800-549-9535.

[1:31:15.620 --> 1:31:18.140]  That's Ioniczone.com today.
[1:31:28.020 --> 1:31:31.180]  Some folks are born with a silver spoon in their hand.
[1:31:31.180 --> 1:31:32.780]  Don't they help themselves?
[1:31:33.660 --> 1:31:35.260]  Some folks are born,
[1:31:35.260 --> 1:31:39.060]  make the way to fly.
[1:31:39.060 --> 1:31:41.700]  The red, white, and blue.
[1:31:41.700 --> 1:31:44.140]  The red, white, and blue.
[1:31:44.140 --> 1:31:46.180]  And when the band plays,
[1:31:46.180 --> 1:31:48.860]  help to the chief blood, no.
[1:31:48.860 --> 1:31:51.300]  They point the cannon at you.
[1:31:55.300 --> 1:31:58.420]  That's an illusion to tyranny.
[1:31:58.420 --> 1:32:00.060]  What did Caesar do when he brought the troops
[1:32:00.060 --> 1:32:05.060]  across the Rubicon 2,060-something years ago?
[1:32:05.060 --> 1:32:07.540]  And they mean nothing to you.
[1:32:07.540 --> 1:32:09.860]  And they mean no, no, no, no.
[1:32:09.860 --> 1:32:14.860]  He brought his troops into Rome to dominate the Senate.
[1:32:15.460 --> 1:32:17.100]  Some folks are born.
[1:32:17.100 --> 1:32:18.940]  It's all happening.
[1:32:18.940 --> 1:32:21.020]  Bloomberg reported several weeks ago
[1:32:21.020 --> 1:32:23.580]  that war powers has been declared.
[1:32:23.580 --> 1:32:27.780]  Former Fed governor said that the New York Fed
[1:32:27.780 --> 1:32:29.180]  is running the treasury, everything.
[1:32:29.180 --> 1:32:30.420]  It's all secret.
[1:32:30.420 --> 1:32:31.620]  Trillion's missing.
[1:32:33.460 --> 1:32:35.380]  Israel is bombarding Gaza.
[1:32:35.380 --> 1:32:37.900]  Now supposedly rockets have been fired last night
[1:32:37.900 --> 1:32:40.140]  in the northern Israel out of Lebanon.
[1:32:40.140 --> 1:32:40.980]  They're responding.
[1:32:40.980 --> 1:32:43.500]  Israel's talking about invading now.
[1:32:43.500 --> 1:32:46.140]  China's talking about not buying U.S. debt anymore.
[1:32:46.140 --> 1:32:49.740]  Obama's announcing spending our way out of the crises
[1:32:49.740 --> 1:32:51.980]  and giving a trillion bucks to select cronies.
[1:32:52.980 --> 1:32:55.740]  I can think of no one better to get on for a half hour
[1:32:55.740 --> 1:32:56.700]  than best-selling author,
[1:32:56.700 --> 1:32:58.820]  lecturer, researcher, syndicator, columnist,
[1:32:58.820 --> 1:33:01.180]  father of Reaganomics, former head of policy,
[1:33:01.180 --> 1:33:04.100]  department of treasury under Ronald Reagan,
[1:33:04.100 --> 1:33:07.300]  a true conservative, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[1:33:07.300 --> 1:33:09.140]  Doctor, it's good to have you here with us.
[1:33:09.140 --> 1:33:09.980]  Well, hello, Alex.
[1:33:09.980 --> 1:33:11.700]  Good to be with you.
[1:33:11.700 --> 1:33:14.180]  Everything we feared, the martial law, the troops,
[1:33:14.180 --> 1:33:17.540]  there's now Marines at checkpoints in the mainstream news,
[1:33:17.540 --> 1:33:20.340]  helping look for drunk drivers as they acclimate us.
[1:33:20.340 --> 1:33:21.700]  There's so much to talk about.
[1:33:21.700 --> 1:33:23.460]  What should we get into first?
[1:33:23.460 --> 1:33:25.820]  Well, whatever's on your mind.
[1:33:25.820 --> 1:33:27.420]  Let's talk about the police state.
[1:33:27.420 --> 1:33:29.300]  Clearly they've been setting it up for a long time.
[1:33:29.300 --> 1:33:31.180]  We hope that Obama wouldn't continue
[1:33:31.180 --> 1:33:33.340]  with the whole operation, but it appears
[1:33:33.340 --> 1:33:35.500]  that's the direction he's going in,
[1:33:35.500 --> 1:33:38.500]  the trillions missing and the economy.
[1:33:38.500 --> 1:33:40.660]  Where do you see it all going?
[1:33:42.380 --> 1:33:45.980]  Well, it's easier for me to say something
[1:33:47.340 --> 1:33:48.740]  about the economy.
[1:33:48.740 --> 1:33:50.860]  I think in the new term, Alex,
[1:33:50.860 --> 1:33:53.940]  we're going to experience more deflation
[1:33:53.940 --> 1:33:57.860]  in an effort to stem the deflation.
[1:33:57.860 --> 1:34:01.900]  There'll be a tremendous new creation of money and credit,
[1:34:01.900 --> 1:34:04.180]  particularly for the United States government,
[1:34:04.180 --> 1:34:07.940]  which this year on the cash basis,
[1:34:07.940 --> 1:34:10.460]  which is the basis the OMB uses
[1:34:10.460 --> 1:34:13.420]  for the government's fiscal year budget.
[1:34:13.420 --> 1:34:16.100]  The deficit will be $2 trillion.
[1:34:18.140 --> 1:34:21.300]  I don't know of any way they can finance that.
[1:34:21.300 --> 1:34:26.300]  Possibly the flight of Americans out of stocks
[1:34:28.180 --> 1:34:31.380]  and money market funds and bank CDs
[1:34:32.700 --> 1:34:35.940]  may take refuge in governments,
[1:34:35.940 --> 1:34:40.940]  but other than that, they'll have to monetize it.
[1:34:43.020 --> 1:34:45.420]  That is, the Federal Reserve will simply have
[1:34:45.420 --> 1:34:47.820]  to take the bonds and print money.
[1:34:47.820 --> 1:34:50.500]  I don't think the foreigners will lend it to them
[1:34:50.500 --> 1:34:54.140]  because they'll see it as an enormous dilution
[1:34:54.140 --> 1:34:57.780]  of the existing holdings, which are massive.
[1:34:57.780 --> 1:35:02.780]  And most likely, the issuance of all this new debt
[1:35:03.580 --> 1:35:08.580]  will cause foreigners to want to lighten up
[1:35:08.860 --> 1:35:12.180]  their holdings of treasury bonds,
[1:35:12.180 --> 1:35:13.780]  and they'll come on the market too,
[1:35:13.780 --> 1:35:15.580]  and they'll have to be monetized.
[1:35:15.580 --> 1:35:17.940]  Sir, as a top economist,
[1:35:17.940 --> 1:35:19.940]  what would you describe this that we're going into?
[1:35:19.940 --> 1:35:22.900]  The hyper-stag inflation,
[1:35:22.900 --> 1:35:25.060]  because we have a depressing of the real economy,
[1:35:25.060 --> 1:35:27.420]  a contraction, but at the same time,
[1:35:27.420 --> 1:35:30.940]  this massive issuance of currency and liquidity
[1:35:30.940 --> 1:35:34.300]  to select groups, I mean, what do you call that?
[1:35:34.300 --> 1:35:36.620]  Yeah, I think I agree with John Williams
[1:35:36.620 --> 1:35:39.620]  that this is going to be a hyper-inflationary depression.
[1:35:41.020 --> 1:35:42.900]  As I was leading into that,
[1:35:42.900 --> 1:35:46.060]  the initial stages are deflation,
[1:35:46.060 --> 1:35:47.740]  which what we're seeing now,
[1:35:47.740 --> 1:35:50.900]  there'll be money and credit creation,
[1:35:50.900 --> 1:35:53.900]  there'll be pressure on the dollar in the exchange markets,
[1:35:55.180 --> 1:35:58.100]  and inflation will eventually result
[1:35:58.100 --> 1:36:00.580]  from all this money and credit,
[1:36:00.580 --> 1:36:02.420]  and there'll then be pressure on the dollar
[1:36:02.420 --> 1:36:04.020]  from the domestic inflation rate.
[1:36:04.020 --> 1:36:09.020]  And so I just don't see how they can manage this
[1:36:11.620 --> 1:36:16.100]  with any traditional economic policy tools.
[1:36:16.100 --> 1:36:20.220]  So I think high unemployment and rising prices,
[1:36:20.220 --> 1:36:23.300]  and it will be worse than the Great Depression,
[1:36:23.300 --> 1:36:24.740]  because during the Great Depression,
[1:36:24.740 --> 1:36:29.980]  the high unemployment was accommodated,
[1:36:29.980 --> 1:36:31.740]  in a sense, with falling prices.
[1:36:32.740 --> 1:36:34.660]  But now we have people losing their jobs
[1:36:34.660 --> 1:36:39.100]  while prices rise, and that's much harder to deal with.
[1:36:39.100 --> 1:36:41.020]  So I think it's going to be very bad,
[1:36:41.020 --> 1:36:45.220]  it might be why they're deploying troops
[1:36:45.220 --> 1:36:47.620]  since they expect that there'll be a lot
[1:36:47.620 --> 1:36:49.100]  of dislocation of people.
[1:36:49.100 --> 1:36:53.020]  I mean, just look at the full closure rate on homes,
[1:36:53.020 --> 1:36:55.180]  on mortgages, and the amount of people
[1:36:55.180 --> 1:36:56.620]  who've already lost their homes.
[1:36:56.620 --> 1:36:58.540]  And then I know people that have jobs
[1:36:58.540 --> 1:37:00.700]  who are trying to get modest houses.
[1:37:00.700 --> 1:37:02.420]  There's all these empty houses sitting around,
[1:37:02.420 --> 1:37:04.260]  but the banks won't give them a loan
[1:37:04.260 --> 1:37:07.700]  for people that have jobs and money to even get a new house.
[1:37:08.540 --> 1:37:11.820]  Well, I don't know, that was true for a while,
[1:37:11.820 --> 1:37:14.140]  but I think they're willing to lend
[1:37:14.140 --> 1:37:17.140]  if you've got jobs and money.
[1:37:17.140 --> 1:37:22.140]  But the fact is that if you look at the current
[1:37:24.820 --> 1:37:28.340]  unemployment rate, and we measure it like it used
[1:37:28.340 --> 1:37:32.100]  to be measured 20 years ago by the government,
[1:37:32.100 --> 1:37:34.180]  before they monkeyed with the numbers,
[1:37:34.180 --> 1:37:37.180]  that we already have 15, 16% unemployment.
[1:37:38.700 --> 1:37:41.500]  I mean, that's the current rate of unemployment.
[1:37:41.500 --> 1:37:43.740]  And this, I think, is just starting.
[1:37:43.740 --> 1:37:45.340]  There's a lot more to hit, you know,
[1:37:45.340 --> 1:37:50.340]  than not just the subprime derivatives,
[1:37:51.180 --> 1:37:53.220]  but we've got all that credit card debt,
[1:37:53.220 --> 1:37:56.140]  we've got car loans, and that's that.
[1:37:56.140 --> 1:37:58.340]  Home improvement loans.
[1:37:58.340 --> 1:38:01.580]  Well, business loans.
[1:38:01.580 --> 1:38:04.460]  Well, they've got the,
[1:38:04.460 --> 1:38:06.020]  I'm talking about the securitized stuff.
[1:38:06.020 --> 1:38:07.820]  Yeah, all the stuff they've been selling now.
[1:38:07.820 --> 1:38:10.460]  So they've got credit card debt, they've got car loans,
[1:38:10.460 --> 1:38:13.220]  and they've got now, of course, the commercial.
[1:38:13.220 --> 1:38:16.620]  Loans, you know, all the shopping centers and stuff there.
[1:38:16.620 --> 1:38:19.420]  Stores and the shopping centers are closing,
[1:38:19.420 --> 1:38:22.140]  and so the rent, so the owners of the shopping centers
[1:38:22.140 --> 1:38:24.420]  are down, so they're gonna be defaulting.
[1:38:24.420 --> 1:38:27.140]  So this is not gonna be, this is not,
[1:38:27.140 --> 1:38:28.980]  it's just starting, I think.
[1:38:28.980 --> 1:38:31.500]  The economists just came out, as you know,
[1:38:31.500 --> 1:38:33.460]  I'm sure, and said that we are in a depression,
[1:38:33.460 --> 1:38:36.660]  not a recession, and now we've got leaders of countries
[1:38:36.660 --> 1:38:39.420]  saying it's a worldwide depression beginning.
[1:38:39.420 --> 1:38:41.500]  So we went from, there's no recession,
[1:38:41.500 --> 1:38:44.020]  to now we're going into a depression.
[1:38:45.100 --> 1:38:48.900]  Looking at this, how do you see this unfolding?
[1:38:48.900 --> 1:38:50.540]  When will we hit the depths of it,
[1:38:50.540 --> 1:38:53.100]  and how bad will it be?
[1:38:53.100 --> 1:38:56.940]  Well, that requires a crystal ball.
[1:38:56.940 --> 1:39:00.220]  I don't think anything like this has ever happened before.
[1:39:01.580 --> 1:39:03.780]  Certainly not in the United States.
[1:39:03.780 --> 1:39:08.220]  And so I can't answer that.
[1:39:08.220 --> 1:39:10.780]  All I can say is that people are first gonna be put
[1:39:10.780 --> 1:39:14.020]  through the ringer of deflation,
[1:39:14.020 --> 1:39:15.540]  declining asset values,
[1:39:15.540 --> 1:39:19.740]  and then the efforts they make to deal with that
[1:39:19.740 --> 1:39:24.300]  is gonna, it will set off the opposite,
[1:39:24.300 --> 1:39:26.660]  rising inflation, it probably,
[1:39:26.660 --> 1:39:29.300]  it could easily reach hyperinflationary level.
[1:39:31.140 --> 1:39:33.940]  And no one really knows what to do,
[1:39:33.940 --> 1:39:35.580]  and there aren't really any solutions.
[1:39:35.580 --> 1:39:37.940]  Will that be at all, will that be at all?
[1:39:37.940 --> 1:39:38.900]  Sure, go ahead.
[1:39:38.900 --> 1:39:41.460]  You have to understand too, the United States
[1:39:41.460 --> 1:39:45.500]  is now a heavily import dependent country.
[1:39:45.500 --> 1:39:47.420]  We weren't during the depression.
[1:39:47.420 --> 1:39:48.940]  We weren't dependent on import.
[1:39:48.940 --> 1:39:50.060]  We were on the land.
[1:39:50.060 --> 1:39:52.140]  Well, but we weren't dependent.
[1:39:52.140 --> 1:39:54.460]  We had no trade deficits,
[1:39:54.460 --> 1:39:57.340]  but we didn't have to import energy and manufactured goods
[1:39:57.340 --> 1:39:58.860]  and advanced technology products,
[1:39:58.860 --> 1:40:00.620]  and our shoes and our clothes.
[1:40:00.620 --> 1:40:03.740]  You see now, we're heavily dependent on import,
[1:40:03.740 --> 1:40:06.260]  so we have massive trade deficits,
[1:40:06.260 --> 1:40:07.500]  and no way to pay for them,
[1:40:07.500 --> 1:40:09.300]  particularly if the dollar goes.
[1:40:09.300 --> 1:40:14.300]  So I think the potential here is far worse
[1:40:14.540 --> 1:40:15.380]  than the depression.
[1:40:15.380 --> 1:40:18.220]  I don't see any leadership in Washington.
[1:40:18.220 --> 1:40:19.780]  The first thing they did is,
[1:40:19.780 --> 1:40:22.100]  I'm sure you've emphasized many times,
[1:40:22.100 --> 1:40:24.780]  is that they ran and stole a trillion dollars
[1:40:24.780 --> 1:40:27.180]  from the taxpayers and gave it to the banksters.
[1:40:28.580 --> 1:40:31.980]  And so the first thing they did when they see a crisis
[1:40:31.980 --> 1:40:34.980]  is to take advantage of it, to steal from us,
[1:40:34.980 --> 1:40:39.420]  or to give to the banksters who caused the problem.
[1:40:39.420 --> 1:40:42.500]  So you can see that with the kind of leadership
[1:40:42.500 --> 1:40:43.780]  we have, they're criminals.
[1:40:43.780 --> 1:40:45.660]  They're a way, anything that happens,
[1:40:45.660 --> 1:40:48.940]  they use it as an opportunity to steal more.
[1:40:48.940 --> 1:40:51.820]  And sir, as you know, Obama cheer-leaded
[1:40:51.820 --> 1:40:54.740]  for the Banker Takeover Bill called the bailout,
[1:40:54.740 --> 1:40:56.900]  and whereas people had hoped he would,
[1:40:56.900 --> 1:40:58.860]  at least it would be a repreiation of Bush,
[1:40:58.860 --> 1:41:01.020]  it appears that he is going to accelerate
[1:41:01.020 --> 1:41:03.140]  the entire program, including the Middle East,
[1:41:03.140 --> 1:41:05.260]  confrontation with Russia, everything.
[1:41:05.260 --> 1:41:08.620]  Well, you know, Alex, what's gonna put the quietest
[1:41:08.620 --> 1:41:11.980]  on their confrontation with Russia and their wars
[1:41:13.260 --> 1:41:15.660]  in Afghanistan and everywhere else
[1:41:15.660 --> 1:41:18.540]  is the fact that they're not having any resources.
[1:41:18.540 --> 1:41:23.220]  See, all of that is financed by China and Japan and the Saudis.
[1:41:24.340 --> 1:41:28.140]  And why are they gonna keep financing a thinking ship?
[1:41:28.140 --> 1:41:30.700]  I mean, we're talking about a ship that's gonna sink big time.
[1:41:30.700 --> 1:41:32.060]  So you're saying it will sink.
[1:41:32.060 --> 1:41:34.940]  You're saying now we will have a mega-depression now.
[1:41:34.940 --> 1:41:36.180]  Because the last time we had you on,
[1:41:36.180 --> 1:41:37.500]  you said it was a possibility.
[1:41:37.500 --> 1:41:40.260]  And just a few months, you're now saying mega-depression.
[1:41:40.260 --> 1:41:42.140]  I don't see any way around it.
[1:41:42.140 --> 1:41:45.020]  Just ask yourself, how can they finance
[1:41:45.020 --> 1:41:49.780]  this current year's operating budget deficit
[1:41:49.780 --> 1:41:52.740]  of $2 trillion?
[1:41:54.060 --> 1:41:57.140]  That's at least five times larger than any deficit
[1:41:57.140 --> 1:41:59.340]  they've ever had to finance before.
[1:41:59.340 --> 1:42:01.660]  And they're in a much weaker position.
[1:42:01.660 --> 1:42:03.660]  But they're counting on the military
[1:42:03.660 --> 1:42:06.540]  to enforce the bank or takeover of the Republic
[1:42:06.540 --> 1:42:09.820]  and a militarized police who are so arrogant now,
[1:42:09.820 --> 1:42:12.060]  they shoot a guy on video in the back for no reason
[1:42:12.060 --> 1:42:14.740]  on the ground and aren't even gonna indict the cop
[1:42:14.740 --> 1:42:17.660]  that did it and people are rioting in San Francisco.
[1:42:17.660 --> 1:42:20.900]  Yes, I think that the police are out of control.
[1:42:20.900 --> 1:42:24.460]  And they're basically thugs who like to use violence.
[1:42:24.460 --> 1:42:27.180]  And there's no accountability now
[1:42:27.180 --> 1:42:30.460]  because the government got away with 9-11.
[1:42:30.460 --> 1:42:33.380]  And so any kind of violence is justified
[1:42:33.380 --> 1:42:37.060]  in terms of protecting us from terrorists
[1:42:37.060 --> 1:42:38.860]  or people who might have been a terrorist.
[1:42:38.860 --> 1:42:41.700]  So you've been on that, you know that.
[1:42:41.700 --> 1:42:43.060]  Well, you're not mincing words now.
[1:42:43.060 --> 1:42:45.780]  You're seeing guaranteed mega-depression, 9-11's
[1:42:45.780 --> 1:42:48.300]  an inside job, not the evidence points towards it.
[1:42:48.300 --> 1:42:50.900]  Man, you've, I mean, you're really, Dr. Roberts coming
[1:42:50.900 --> 1:42:52.620]  right out and putting it all on the table.
[1:42:52.620 --> 1:42:55.220]  Well, I've never tried to hide anything.
[1:42:55.220 --> 1:42:58.740]  I just try to say what the evidence supports.
[1:42:58.740 --> 1:43:01.980]  I never believed 9-11 because I was
[1:43:01.980 --> 1:43:03.940]  had engineering training at Georgia Tech
[1:43:03.940 --> 1:43:06.540]  and I could tell when a building is being blown up
[1:43:06.540 --> 1:43:07.860]  by explosives.
[1:43:07.860 --> 1:43:09.780]  Any fool can look at those films
[1:43:09.780 --> 1:43:12.860]  and see the buildings aren't falling down, they're blowing up.
[1:43:12.860 --> 1:43:16.180]  I know, and so we're in the Twilight Zone, Dr.
[1:43:16.180 --> 1:43:18.140]  I mean, you're the father of Reaganomics,
[1:43:18.140 --> 1:43:19.900]  the big star with Ronald Reagan.
[1:43:19.900 --> 1:43:22.100]  I mean, you're so respected and now here you are
[1:43:22.100 --> 1:43:23.660]  writing and talking about all this
[1:43:23.660 --> 1:43:25.460]  and people in government are snickering
[1:43:25.460 --> 1:43:27.780]  and sucking their thumbs while, as you said,
[1:43:27.780 --> 1:43:30.340]  wild criminals are running around stealing
[1:43:30.340 --> 1:43:31.820]  and suddenly all these billionaires
[1:43:31.820 --> 1:43:34.340]  are hanging themselves, jumping in front of trains.
[1:43:34.340 --> 1:43:35.820]  They're clearly being killed.
[1:43:35.820 --> 1:43:39.140]  Madoff, he didn't steal 50 to 100 billion by himself.
[1:43:39.140 --> 1:43:41.540]  It turns out big banks knew and were involved with him.
[1:43:41.540 --> 1:43:42.380]  I mean, you're right.
[1:43:42.380 --> 1:43:44.460]  Can you speak about the Madoff syndrome?
[1:43:44.460 --> 1:43:46.780]  This is the founder of the NASDAQ.
[1:43:46.780 --> 1:43:49.740]  Yeah, I just don't, I just don't know enough about it,
[1:43:49.740 --> 1:43:54.740]  but it certainly does show the extent of the total corruption.
[1:43:54.740 --> 1:43:57.180]  The extent of the total corruption.
[1:43:57.180 --> 1:43:59.140]  I mean, the man didn't need to do that.
[1:43:59.140 --> 1:44:00.940]  It wasn't like he was poor.
[1:44:01.780 --> 1:44:05.220]  And furthermore, nobody needs 50 billion.
[1:44:05.220 --> 1:44:08.340]  There's nothing you can do with 50 billion dollars.
[1:44:08.340 --> 1:44:09.780]  It's a huge sum.
[1:44:09.780 --> 1:44:13.620]  It's not large enough to create your own private army
[1:44:13.620 --> 1:44:17.140]  to overthrow the United States or China or anything,
[1:44:17.140 --> 1:44:20.020]  but it's far larger than anybody could ever spend.
[1:44:20.020 --> 1:44:22.340]  But that's what Wall Street and the Banksters have done,
[1:44:22.340 --> 1:44:25.100]  is they have stolen the pension funds,
[1:44:25.100 --> 1:44:26.900]  moved all this money into other assets,
[1:44:26.900 --> 1:44:28.500]  and they are overthrowing us.
[1:44:30.500 --> 1:44:31.340]  That's right.
[1:44:31.340 --> 1:44:34.180]  They're overthrowing our financial security.
[1:44:34.180 --> 1:44:35.940]  They pretty much accomplished that.
[1:44:35.940 --> 1:44:38.740]  But aren't they burning down their own house in the process?
[1:44:41.380 --> 1:44:45.180]  You know, it is sort of surprising
[1:44:45.180 --> 1:44:47.180]  that the people haven't dragged them out in the street
[1:44:47.180 --> 1:44:48.980]  and hung them, actually.
[1:44:48.980 --> 1:44:51.060]  I mean, you know, a hundred years ago,
[1:44:51.060 --> 1:44:53.300]  what would have happened to them, I can't say I know,
[1:44:53.300 --> 1:44:57.780]  but, and we don't know what's gonna happen yet.
[1:44:59.980 --> 1:45:03.980]  But, you know, we don't need to be so extreme
[1:45:03.980 --> 1:45:05.620]  in what we say.
[1:45:05.620 --> 1:45:06.860]  We can just ask the question,
[1:45:06.860 --> 1:45:09.660]  how are they gonna finance a $2 trillion deficit?
[1:45:10.900 --> 1:45:12.340]  This is never done before.
[1:45:13.500 --> 1:45:14.500]  When I was in Treasury,
[1:45:14.500 --> 1:45:16.700]  if we had had to finance a $2 trillion deficit,
[1:45:16.700 --> 1:45:19.060]  we wouldn't have known what to do.
[1:45:19.060 --> 1:45:23.540]  And of course, the economy then was far stronger.
[1:45:23.540 --> 1:45:26.020]  And we didn't have massive trade deficits.
[1:45:28.300 --> 1:45:32.100]  We hadn't offshored all the good jobs.
[1:45:32.100 --> 1:45:33.860]  So how do you see this unraveling then?
[1:45:33.860 --> 1:45:38.380]  Because I've got several mainstream articles here today.
[1:45:38.380 --> 1:45:42.180]  Here's one, US companies face $409 million pension deficit.
[1:45:42.180 --> 1:45:45.300]  But then you read the number that the pensions
[1:45:45.300 --> 1:45:48.780]  in the end of 2007 were 1.66 trillion.
[1:45:48.780 --> 1:45:53.220]  But now the liabilities are 1.6 trillion.
[1:45:53.220 --> 1:45:55.260]  So it says there's only six billion left.
[1:45:55.260 --> 1:45:57.060]  This is Reuters.
[1:45:57.060 --> 1:45:58.140]  Here's another one.
[1:45:59.180 --> 1:46:00.500]  International Herald Tribune,
[1:46:00.500 --> 1:46:03.060]  US debt is losing appeal in China.
[1:46:03.060 --> 1:46:05.260]  And it sorts this major Chinese papers saying
[1:46:05.260 --> 1:46:08.380]  they may just completely stop buying US debt.
[1:46:08.380 --> 1:46:10.700]  Well, I suspect they will.
[1:46:10.700 --> 1:46:13.500]  And as I said, we've already covered that
[1:46:13.500 --> 1:46:18.300]  when people see, you know, our creditors are far enough.
[1:46:18.300 --> 1:46:20.860]  Because the American saving rate is zero.
[1:46:20.860 --> 1:46:22.380]  Negative.
[1:46:22.380 --> 1:46:23.540]  It may be negative.
[1:46:23.540 --> 1:46:26.020]  But the point is, we don't have any money
[1:46:26.020 --> 1:46:28.100]  to finance our deficit.
[1:46:28.100 --> 1:46:30.660]  So we have to rely on foreigners.
[1:46:30.660 --> 1:46:34.020]  Now, I did say it's possible that this deficit
[1:46:34.020 --> 1:46:37.980]  can be financed by the American flight from stocks
[1:46:37.980 --> 1:46:40.380]  and money market funds and bank CDs.
[1:46:40.380 --> 1:46:43.900]  Because they may be further crises
[1:46:43.900 --> 1:46:45.980]  from the credit card debt and all the rest
[1:46:45.980 --> 1:46:48.860]  that cause them again to lose confidence.
[1:46:48.860 --> 1:46:50.740]  And so people may buy the treasuries.
[1:46:50.740 --> 1:46:53.860]  Just as the only place they think they can put the money
[1:46:53.860 --> 1:46:55.500]  other than in their mattress.
[1:46:55.500 --> 1:46:56.860]  Even though they get no return.
[1:46:56.860 --> 1:46:58.060]  Even though they get no return.
[1:46:58.060 --> 1:46:59.020]  They may do that.
[1:46:59.020 --> 1:47:02.620]  And that may finance it.
[1:47:02.620 --> 1:47:05.620]  Nevertheless, even if that does finance it,
[1:47:05.620 --> 1:47:09.180]  the foreigners are gonna see a look.
[1:47:09.180 --> 1:47:12.700]  There's 2 trillion more in treasury bonds that are out.
[1:47:12.700 --> 1:47:15.820]  What has that done to the value of mine?
[1:47:17.540 --> 1:47:19.540]  Should I be holding these things?
[1:47:19.540 --> 1:47:22.100]  And then if they start lightening up the existing holdings,
[1:47:22.100 --> 1:47:23.700]  not only will they not buy anymore,
[1:47:23.700 --> 1:47:25.860]  they start selling what they got.
[1:47:25.860 --> 1:47:28.300]  Then all that comes into the market.
[1:47:28.300 --> 1:47:30.220]  Who takes that up?
[1:47:30.220 --> 1:47:33.780]  And the Fed would have to monetize it.
[1:47:33.780 --> 1:47:35.300]  They just have to create the money.
[1:47:35.300 --> 1:47:37.500]  So you're saying no way out, any way you cut it,
[1:47:37.500 --> 1:47:39.980]  they can only extend out the total collapse
[1:47:39.980 --> 1:47:41.380]  but make it worse when it does happen.
[1:47:41.380 --> 1:47:44.140]  Well, I can't see how they can get out of that.
[1:47:44.140 --> 1:47:45.780]  Whatever they do, it looks to me,
[1:47:45.780 --> 1:47:49.940]  is either going to put pressure on the dollar's exchange value,
[1:47:51.220 --> 1:47:52.740]  driving it down.
[1:47:52.740 --> 1:47:55.100]  Or it's gonna cause more inflation,
[1:47:55.100 --> 1:47:56.940]  driving the value of the dollar down.
[1:47:58.300 --> 1:48:02.600]  Or it's gonna erode the government's credit standing.
[1:48:04.420 --> 1:48:05.820]  There's nothing they can do.
[1:48:05.820 --> 1:48:08.660]  That's not gonna do one of those 3 things.
[1:48:08.660 --> 1:48:11.860]  Perhaps all of them that I can think of.
[1:48:11.860 --> 1:48:14.780]  Now, maybe some brilliant person will show up
[1:48:14.780 --> 1:48:18.580]  and they'll come up with some new scheme and...
[1:48:18.580 --> 1:48:20.900]  But you know, Alex, the problem is
[1:48:20.900 --> 1:48:25.900]  that the debt has so greatly outpaced
[1:48:26.980 --> 1:48:29.220]  the growth of real income.
[1:48:29.220 --> 1:48:31.900]  That there's just not enough income there
[1:48:31.900 --> 1:48:33.900]  to support the debt.
[1:48:33.900 --> 1:48:37.620]  And generally, Alex, when that happens,
[1:48:37.620 --> 1:48:41.340]  they get rid of it by inflating away the debt.
[1:48:41.340 --> 1:48:42.300]  Yes.
[1:48:42.300 --> 1:48:46.580]  So that is the most likely outcome.
[1:48:46.580 --> 1:48:47.740]  Well, Obama said that today.
[1:48:47.740 --> 1:48:49.300]  He said they're gonna print money.
[1:48:49.300 --> 1:48:50.460]  That's the headline on Drudge.
[1:48:50.460 --> 1:48:51.300]  Wow.
[1:48:52.220 --> 1:48:53.460]  How do we protect ourselves?
[1:48:53.460 --> 1:48:55.020]  We'll talk to Dr. Roberts on the other side
[1:48:55.020 --> 1:48:57.400]  in the final sort of segment with him.
[1:48:57.400 --> 1:48:59.700]  He's got his book out, his new book out,
[1:48:59.700 --> 1:49:01.500]  and it's second edition updated.
[1:49:01.500 --> 1:49:03.820]  The tyranny of good intentions.
[1:49:03.820 --> 1:49:08.820]  And, well, it gets into just the incredible corruption
[1:49:10.740 --> 1:49:12.580]  of the courts and the whole system.
[1:49:12.580 --> 1:49:14.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's no way to polish this thing.
[1:49:14.780 --> 1:49:16.420]  It is what it is, a big turd.
[1:49:19.140 --> 1:49:21.020]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be
[1:49:21.020 --> 1:49:22.900]  an essential part of our daily diet.
[1:49:22.900 --> 1:49:24.900]  With so many different methods of consumption,
[1:49:24.900 --> 1:49:27.140]  how do you choose a simple yet effective way
[1:49:27.140 --> 1:49:28.660]  to get your daily intake?
[1:49:28.660 --> 1:49:30.180]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks
[1:49:30.180 --> 1:49:32.860]  at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[1:49:32.860 --> 1:49:35.420]  Nature's Gem, premium omega-3.
[1:49:35.420 --> 1:49:38.100]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown
[1:49:38.100 --> 1:49:39.940]  on our farm in northern Minnesota,
[1:49:39.940 --> 1:49:42.980]  providing cooler temperatures and longer summer hours,
[1:49:42.980 --> 1:49:44.780]  producing the highest quality
[1:49:44.780 --> 1:49:46.780]  premium golden flaxseed around.
[1:49:46.780 --> 1:49:48.900]  In addition, we selectively harvest
[1:49:48.900 --> 1:49:51.500]  and sort flaxseeds by size and weight,
[1:49:51.500 --> 1:49:52.860]  keeping only the best seeds
[1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:55.500]  that can produce the highest abundance of omega-3.
[1:49:55.500 --> 1:49:58.860]  The result is a delicious, nutty, buttery flavor.
[1:49:58.860 --> 1:50:00.940]  Nature's Gem golden flax is pure.
[1:50:00.940 --> 1:50:04.420]  There is nothing added and nothing taken away and non-GMO.

[1:50:19.220 --> 1:50:21.340]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[1:50:21.340 --> 1:50:24.140]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:50:24.140 --> 1:50:26.540]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:50:26.540 --> 1:50:27.700]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:50:27.700 --> 1:50:29.340]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:50:29.340 --> 1:50:32.140]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage.
[1:50:32.140 --> 1:50:34.540]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[1:50:34.540 --> 1:50:36.700]  the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[1:50:36.700 --> 1:50:38.500]  We said that, I'm shut up.
[1:50:38.500 --> 1:50:40.860]  The day that we stop asking questions
[1:50:40.860 --> 1:50:43.740]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[1:50:43.740 --> 1:50:45.420]  to grow at our own door.
[1:50:45.420 --> 1:50:48.500]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[1:50:48.500 --> 1:50:51.580]  a global awakening has taken place.
[1:50:51.580 --> 1:50:54.100]  An inside job?
[1:50:54.100 --> 1:50:55.180]  How dare you?
[1:50:55.180 --> 1:50:57.340]  I don't want to see what the comic suggests in the show.
[1:50:57.340 --> 1:50:58.220]  9-11.
[1:50:58.220 --> 1:50:59.820]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[1:50:59.820 --> 1:51:01.740]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:51:01.740 --> 1:51:04.500]  Well, Helen is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:51:04.500 --> 1:51:07.380]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years,
[1:51:07.380 --> 1:51:09.980]  we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:51:09.980 --> 1:51:10.980]  Truth rising.

[1:51:19.140 --> 1:51:20.980]  Before you throw away your used batteries,
[1:51:20.980 --> 1:51:22.580]  you need to listen to this.
[1:51:22.580 --> 1:51:24.540]  Now going green can save money.
[1:51:24.540 --> 1:51:27.740]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries
[1:51:27.740 --> 1:51:30.140]  by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[1:51:30.140 --> 1:51:32.780]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery
[1:51:32.780 --> 1:51:34.500]  charging technology that effectively
[1:51:34.500 --> 1:51:37.380]  extends a life of new batteries and gives new life to used
[1:51:37.380 --> 1:51:38.100]  batteries.
[1:51:38.100 --> 1:51:40.940]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Badini,
[1:51:40.940 --> 1:51:43.140]  this unique and patented charging system
[1:51:43.140 --> 1:51:45.740]  rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure
[1:51:45.740 --> 1:51:47.700]  in the battery without additives.
[1:51:47.700 --> 1:51:50.940]  Increasing capacity and maintaining cell integrity.

[1:52:16.660 --> 1:52:30.460]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[1:52:30.460 --> 1:52:33.540]  I wish your buck was still silver.
[1:52:33.540 --> 1:52:39.580]  It was back when the country was wrong.
[1:52:39.580 --> 1:52:42.100]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, in closing in the five minutes
[1:52:42.100 --> 1:52:45.220]  we have left here in this first New Year's show
[1:52:45.220 --> 1:52:49.780]  I've done with you.
[1:52:49.780 --> 1:52:52.580]  Any ways to turn this around, or if you were in government,
[1:52:52.580 --> 1:52:54.220]  what would you do briefly?
[1:52:54.220 --> 1:52:59.260]  And then a comment on the Gaza situation now expanding
[1:52:59.260 --> 1:53:02.180]  into southern Lebanon.
[1:53:02.180 --> 1:53:04.660]  You may know the Bank of England is the British version
[1:53:04.660 --> 1:53:08.420]  of the Federal Reserve, and one of their former governors
[1:53:08.420 --> 1:53:10.780]  announced two days ago.
[1:53:10.780 --> 1:53:12.940]  This is reported in the London Telegraph.
[1:53:12.940 --> 1:53:15.460]  This is the quote, the long-held assumption
[1:53:15.460 --> 1:53:18.540]  that US assets, particularly government bonds, or a safe
[1:53:18.540 --> 1:53:24.100]  haven, will soon be overturned as investors lose their patience
[1:53:24.100 --> 1:53:28.700]  with the American economy and flee from the dollar.
[1:53:28.700 --> 1:53:33.020]  So he predicts a massive dollar collapse.
[1:53:33.020 --> 1:53:36.700]  Now, if that happens, we're dead meat.
[1:53:36.700 --> 1:53:41.020]  There's nothing we can do, because that's how we pay our bills.
[1:53:41.020 --> 1:53:44.020]  So what would I do if I was in the Treasury?
[1:53:44.020 --> 1:53:47.580]  I would first try to reassure the world
[1:53:47.580 --> 1:53:50.100]  that the dollar still had a chance
[1:53:50.100 --> 1:53:51.300]  to be the reserve currency.
[1:53:51.300 --> 1:53:54.740]  I would do that by attacking the budget
[1:53:54.740 --> 1:53:56.580]  deficit and the trade deficit.
[1:53:56.580 --> 1:53:58.620]  I would attack the budget deficit
[1:53:58.620 --> 1:54:01.860]  by instantly stopping these expensive wars
[1:54:01.860 --> 1:54:05.900]  that we cannot afford, by slashing the massive defense
[1:54:05.900 --> 1:54:08.900]  budget, which is larger than the rest of the world combined,
[1:54:08.900 --> 1:54:11.580]  and has no practical purpose.
[1:54:11.580 --> 1:54:15.700]  We cannot establish American hedging over the world.
[1:54:15.700 --> 1:54:19.540]  I would slash that, and therefore I
[1:54:19.540 --> 1:54:23.300]  would get the damn budget deficit down by a half a trillion
[1:54:23.300 --> 1:54:25.260]  dollars.
[1:54:25.260 --> 1:54:29.780]  And then I would impose a new form of taxes on corporations.
[1:54:29.780 --> 1:54:32.660]  I would abolish income tax, and I would tax them
[1:54:32.660 --> 1:54:35.180]  according to how much of the value
[1:54:35.180 --> 1:54:39.420]  added of their products occurred in the United States.
[1:54:39.420 --> 1:54:42.140]  If they make their goods that they sell to us here,
[1:54:42.140 --> 1:54:43.580]  they have a very low tax rate.
[1:54:43.580 --> 1:54:46.060]  If they make them in China or Indonesia or somewhere else,
[1:54:46.060 --> 1:54:47.940]  they have a very high tax rate.
[1:54:47.940 --> 1:54:51.380]  And so that would tend to bring the jobs back to America.
[1:54:51.380 --> 1:54:54.780]  It was an internal tariff, an internal tariff
[1:54:54.780 --> 1:54:57.820]  to incentivize domestic development.
[1:54:57.820 --> 1:54:58.780]  It's not a tariff.
[1:54:58.780 --> 1:55:01.260]  It's a way of taxing the corporations that
[1:55:01.260 --> 1:55:05.500]  gives the offsets or eliminates their incentive
[1:55:05.500 --> 1:55:07.340]  to chase cheap labor abroad.
[1:55:07.340 --> 1:55:08.300]  And look at the opposite.
[1:55:08.300 --> 1:55:12.300]  Look at globalization with China with all the slave goods.
[1:55:12.300 --> 1:55:16.740]  So now that's, and if this was believable,
[1:55:16.740 --> 1:55:19.500]  then the world might say, OK, these fools are finally
[1:55:19.500 --> 1:55:21.820]  going to take the necessary steps.
[1:55:21.820 --> 1:55:23.260]  They'll get the house back in order.
[1:55:23.260 --> 1:55:25.180]  We'll stick with them.
[1:55:25.180 --> 1:55:28.980]  But if instead all we do is run up more debt
[1:55:28.980 --> 1:55:31.740]  and continue these wars, which they're
[1:55:31.740 --> 1:55:34.740]  going to stop financing sooner or later,
[1:55:34.740 --> 1:55:38.300]  we're going to have this dollar collapse, in which case it's
[1:55:38.300 --> 1:55:38.820]  over.
[1:55:38.820 --> 1:55:39.340]  It's over.
[1:55:39.340 --> 1:55:43.580]  There's no way out if that happens.
[1:55:43.580 --> 1:55:46.260]  Now, what's going on in Palestine?
[1:55:46.260 --> 1:55:49.620]  So many people have said this is genocide.
[1:55:49.620 --> 1:55:53.940]  This is the destruction of eight people.
[1:55:53.940 --> 1:55:56.140]  It's been going on for 60 years.
[1:55:56.140 --> 1:55:59.180]  The Israelis have gotten away with their lives and their
[1:55:59.180 --> 1:56:01.900]  violence and their war crimes for 60 years.
[1:56:01.900 --> 1:56:02.820]  And they'll continue.
[1:56:02.820 --> 1:56:08.300]  I see that the NBC anchor woman in Foreign Affairs
[1:56:08.300 --> 1:56:12.980]  correspondent Andrea Mitchell said on Sunday
[1:56:12.980 --> 1:56:18.980]  that we have American soldiers from the Corps of Engineers
[1:56:18.980 --> 1:56:23.860]  stationed on the Egyptian side of the Rafer crossing,
[1:56:23.860 --> 1:56:27.260]  helping close the tunnels.
[1:56:27.260 --> 1:56:31.260]  So what are we involved in it directly?
[1:56:31.260 --> 1:56:33.740]  Not just that we gave them permission.
[1:56:33.740 --> 1:56:36.740]  We got our guys over there helping them.
[1:56:36.740 --> 1:56:42.020]  So if you look to the extent that there's
[1:56:42.020 --> 1:56:45.860]  more passions left in the world, we're
[1:56:45.860 --> 1:56:48.460]  going to be hated, just like the Israelis.
[1:56:48.460 --> 1:56:48.940]  All right.
[1:56:48.940 --> 1:56:50.500]  So they will be happy when we collapse.
[1:56:50.500 --> 1:56:51.060]  Dr. Roberts?
[1:56:51.060 --> 1:56:53.060]  They'll be happy when we collapse.
[1:56:53.060 --> 1:56:54.940]  Thank you for all your time, sir.
[1:56:54.940 --> 1:56:55.820]  You're welcome, Alan.
[1:56:55.820 --> 1:56:56.820]  Good to be with you.
[1:56:56.820 --> 1:56:57.340]  Take care.
[1:57:01.260 --> 1:57:03.780]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:57:03.780 --> 1:57:06.140]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:57:09.260 --> 1:57:12.500]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[1:57:12.500 --> 1:57:16.020]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:57:16.020 --> 1:57:18.780]  The enemy struck America on September 11.
[1:57:18.780 --> 1:57:20.180]  Who is the enemy?
[1:57:20.180 --> 1:57:21.020]  Bin Laden.
[1:57:21.020 --> 1:57:22.020]  This is his MO.
[1:57:22.020 --> 1:57:23.340]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:57:23.340 --> 1:57:25.380]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:57:25.380 --> 1:57:27.420]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[1:57:27.420 --> 1:57:30.140]  to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:57:30.140 --> 1:57:32.460]  networks inside the United States.
[1:57:32.460 --> 1:57:34.940]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis,
[1:57:34.940 --> 1:57:39.300]  again, very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:57:39.300 --> 1:57:43.100]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:57:43.100 --> 1:57:44.940]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[1:57:44.940 --> 1:57:48.380]  the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:57:48.380 --> 1:57:51.140]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games,
[1:57:51.140 --> 1:57:53.260]  the shadow government, and much, much more.
[1:57:53.260 --> 1:57:54.540]  Fabled Enemies.

[1:58:11.620 --> 1:58:14.020]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:58:14.020 --> 1:58:23.460]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:58:23.460 --> 1:58:24.740]  Big Brother.
[1:58:24.740 --> 1:58:26.540]  Mainstream media.
[1:58:26.540 --> 1:58:28.300]  Government cover-ups.
[1:58:28.300 --> 1:58:29.900]  You want answers?
[1:58:29.900 --> 1:58:31.420]  Well, so does he.
[1:58:31.420 --> 1:58:35.580]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:58:35.580 --> 1:58:45.900]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:58:45.900 --> 1:58:47.060]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:58:47.060 --> 1:58:47.500]  Welcome.
[1:58:47.500 --> 1:58:51.180]  We're going to be live in the next two hours at prisonplanet.tv,
[1:58:51.180 --> 1:58:57.140]  simulcasting this Thursday, January 8, 2009 edition.
[1:58:57.140 --> 1:58:59.500]  This attempt to awaken the world population
[1:58:59.500 --> 1:59:03.860]  to the overarching world psychological dictatorship
[1:59:03.860 --> 1:59:06.900]  that's run by the New World Order.
[1:59:06.900 --> 1:59:08.180]  And for the next hour and a half,
[1:59:08.180 --> 1:59:11.140]  we're honored to be joined by one of the most sought-after
[1:59:11.140 --> 1:59:14.940]  speakers on radio and in person, filmmaker, best-selling
[1:59:14.940 --> 1:59:19.020]  author, David Icke, also championship goalie in his own
[1:59:19.020 --> 1:59:21.420]  right, of course, BBC News presenter
[1:59:21.420 --> 1:59:26.580]  before his startling Saul on the road to Damascus
[1:59:26.580 --> 1:59:28.500]  transformation.
[1:59:28.500 --> 1:59:31.820]  Literally being knocked off his horse with a revelation.
[1:59:31.820 --> 1:59:34.340]  And in the last 15, 16, 17 years,
[1:59:34.340 --> 1:59:36.740]  he has spoken to millions of people around the world.
[1:59:36.740 --> 1:59:37.980]  And we're honored to have him again
[1:59:37.980 --> 1:59:39.220]  for the next hour and a half to talk
[1:59:39.220 --> 1:59:42.580]  about the current world, economic crisis being engineered,
[1:59:42.580 --> 1:59:45.900]  and how this is really going to force an even faster awakening
[1:59:45.900 --> 1:59:46.700]  to this tyranny.
[1:59:46.700 --> 1:59:50.740]  So David Icke, it is great to have you joining us here
[1:59:50.740 --> 1:59:52.020]  from England.
[1:59:52.020 --> 1:59:54.340]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:59:54.340 --> 1:59:55.500]  This is a short segment.
[1:59:55.500 --> 1:59:57.420]  But what are some of the things you want to discuss
[1:59:57.420 --> 1:59:59.500]  and go over today?
[1:59:59.500 --> 2:00:02.060]  Well, certainly, we talk about the financial situation
[2:00:02.060 --> 2:00:05.500]  because, for me, what we're looking at
[2:00:05.500 --> 2:00:08.660]  is a similar situation to when they have a controlled
[2:00:08.660 --> 2:00:10.340]  demolition of a building.
[2:00:10.340 --> 2:00:13.140]  And the charges go off and you see the flashes.
[2:00:13.140 --> 2:00:14.900]  And then, extraordinarily, there's
[2:00:14.900 --> 2:00:18.300]  that split second when nothing seems to happen.
[2:00:18.300 --> 2:00:19.740]  And then the whole thing crashes.
[2:00:19.740 --> 2:00:23.460]  And for me, where we are in this economic engineered collapse
[2:00:23.460 --> 2:00:26.020]  is in that split second before the whole thing
[2:00:26.020 --> 2:00:26.940]  starts to collapse.
[2:00:26.940 --> 2:00:31.260]  And when you think that within that split second,
[2:00:31.260 --> 2:00:34.780]  they have already thrown grotesque amounts of money
[2:00:34.780 --> 2:00:35.980]  at the banks.
[2:00:35.980 --> 2:00:38.940]  The interest rates in America are basically down to zero.
[2:00:38.940 --> 2:00:41.100]  They've just come down in England today
[2:00:41.100 --> 2:00:46.380]  to the lowest ever in the history of the Bank of England, 1.5%.
[2:00:46.380 --> 2:00:48.900]  And none of it is working.
[2:00:48.900 --> 2:00:53.180]  And therefore, when you've thrown all your bullets
[2:00:53.180 --> 2:00:55.300]  at the situation and they're not working,
[2:00:55.300 --> 2:00:58.940]  and we're not even into it yet to the level it's coming,
[2:00:58.940 --> 2:01:02.500]  then we've got a lot of challenges to face.
[2:01:02.500 --> 2:01:05.500]  But as you say, Alex, there's a word in Chinese.
[2:01:05.500 --> 2:01:07.860]  I think that means both danger and opportunity.
[2:01:07.860 --> 2:01:10.460]  And this is a danger from the system
[2:01:10.460 --> 2:01:12.660]  as we perceive it now and through our lives.
[2:01:12.660 --> 2:01:17.020]  But it's a wonderful opportunity to change the system.
[2:01:17.020 --> 2:01:18.980]  In the time we have left in this first segment,
[2:01:18.980 --> 2:01:21.260]  I want to get your response since the last time we
[2:01:21.260 --> 2:01:26.140]  went on to, it's got to be more than 400 articles I've seen.
[2:01:26.140 --> 2:01:27.900]  If you Google the term New World Order and put it
[2:01:27.900 --> 2:01:31.700]  into the news section, not web, but news, the last time I
[2:01:31.700 --> 2:01:33.860]  checked, it was 4,600 news articles,
[2:01:33.860 --> 2:01:36.340]  but I only over the last few months have read.
[2:01:36.340 --> 2:01:37.580]  I know it's more than 300.
[2:01:37.580 --> 2:01:40.460]  It's 10 or 15 a day, I see without looking.
[2:01:40.460 --> 2:01:42.580]  Financial Times of London, Wall Street Journal,
[2:01:42.580 --> 2:01:45.220]  Der Spiegel, all the major publications
[2:01:45.220 --> 2:01:47.940]  of record of the establishment, the Bilderberg
[2:01:47.940 --> 2:01:50.260]  run of their editor in chief, of course,
[2:01:50.260 --> 2:01:52.740]  Bilderberg, Mr. Wolfe, Times of London,
[2:01:52.740 --> 2:01:56.300]  Financial Times saying, and now for world government.
[2:01:56.300 --> 2:01:59.140]  And they say, we set it up in secret, it's for your own good.
[2:01:59.140 --> 2:02:01.060]  We'll save you from the financial collapse
[2:02:01.060 --> 2:02:02.340]  when they engineered it.
[2:02:02.340 --> 2:02:05.060]  And they go on to say that we're
[2:02:05.060 --> 2:02:08.220]  going to pay carbon taxes on all our activities to them.
[2:02:08.220 --> 2:02:10.500]  So Kissinger came out this week and said,
[2:02:10.500 --> 2:02:12.900]  we need to use this crisis for a New World Order.
[2:02:12.900 --> 2:02:15.580]  I mean, they're really, like you said, emerging.
[2:02:15.580 --> 2:02:17.300]  And you've always said, others have said,
[2:02:17.300 --> 2:02:21.180]  at the point of emerging, that is when you know they're finally
[2:02:21.180 --> 2:02:24.340]  going for broke, because now they can't cloak it anymore.
[2:02:24.340 --> 2:02:26.100]  They've got to come out in the open.
[2:02:26.100 --> 2:02:28.780]  No, there was always a time when what they were doing
[2:02:28.780 --> 2:02:30.300]  covertly had to break the surface,
[2:02:30.300 --> 2:02:32.260]  because they want to change society and the image
[2:02:32.260 --> 2:02:33.660]  that they want to change society.
[2:02:33.660 --> 2:02:35.860]  So we have to eventually see it in our face.
[2:02:35.860 --> 2:02:36.860]  And that's what we're seeing.
[2:02:36.860 --> 2:02:40.780]  And of course, those of us like you and me and many others
[2:02:40.780 --> 2:02:44.940]  who've been warning about this for so long,
[2:02:44.940 --> 2:02:49.340]  it's unfolding in such a blatantly predictable way.
[2:02:49.340 --> 2:02:53.180]  This engineered collapse is there as a massive problem
[2:02:53.180 --> 2:02:55.060]  through which you offer the solution.
[2:02:55.060 --> 2:02:57.580]  And the solutions are the infrastructure
[2:02:57.580 --> 2:02:59.380]  we've been predicting all this time,
[2:02:59.380 --> 2:03:01.180]  including the World Central Bank.
[2:03:01.180 --> 2:03:03.220]  They've not used that word yet, that term yet,
[2:03:03.220 --> 2:03:03.820]  but they will.
[2:03:03.820 --> 2:03:06.900]  They're talking about the architecture.
[2:03:06.900 --> 2:03:09.020]  Actually, they have mentioned a New World Central Bank.
[2:03:09.020 --> 2:03:09.980]  You may have missed it.
[2:03:09.980 --> 2:03:10.540]  Stay there.
[2:03:10.540 --> 2:03:12.540]  David Ike, we'll be back after this quick break
[2:03:12.540 --> 2:03:14.700]  to go over all of this.
[2:03:14.700 --> 2:03:15.860]  Please stay with us.
[2:03:15.860 --> 2:03:20.100]  Hello, friends.
[2:03:20.100 --> 2:03:21.140]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:03:21.140 --> 2:03:22.660]  I've told you for a long time it's
[2:03:22.660 --> 2:03:24.100]  important to be self-sufficient.
[2:03:24.100 --> 2:03:25.900]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[2:03:25.900 --> 2:03:27.060]  We need to be independent.
[2:03:27.060 --> 2:03:28.860]  And food and water is the key.
[2:03:28.860 --> 2:03:30.660]  You'll never have to stand in a red line
[2:03:30.660 --> 2:03:31.900]  if you have your own bread.
[2:03:31.900 --> 2:03:33.580]  You'll never have to go to the super dome
[2:03:33.580 --> 2:03:35.660]  and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[2:03:35.660 --> 2:03:37.980]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[2:03:37.980 --> 2:03:40.660]  Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[2:03:40.660 --> 2:03:41.740]  with a special interest.
[2:03:41.740 --> 2:03:43.820]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[2:03:43.820 --> 2:03:45.660]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[2:03:45.660 --> 2:03:49.620]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[2:03:49.620 --> 2:03:52.420]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[2:03:52.420 --> 2:03:54.860]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[2:03:54.860 --> 2:03:56.740]  will slash your life savings to nothing
[2:03:56.740 --> 2:03:59.740]  and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food
[2:03:59.740 --> 2:04:01.540]  beyond many Americans' reach.
[2:04:01.540 --> 2:04:03.660]  In pre-Nazi Germany's super inflation,
[2:04:03.660 --> 2:04:06.300]  the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[2:04:06.300 --> 2:04:08.660]  until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[2:04:08.660 --> 2:04:10.900]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[2:04:10.900 --> 2:04:13.100]  there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[2:04:13.100 --> 2:04:15.460]  The private banks, merging with our government,
[2:04:15.460 --> 2:04:17.100]  are refusing to loan grocery stores
[2:04:17.100 --> 2:04:18.820]  enough money to restock their shelves.
[2:04:18.820 --> 2:04:20.060]  The stores have less food,
[2:04:20.060 --> 2:04:22.020]  but jack up prices to stay in business.
[2:04:22.020 --> 2:04:23.580]  Whatever happens in America,
[2:04:23.580 --> 2:04:25.340]  we need to be prepared and be ready.
[2:04:25.340 --> 2:04:27.180]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[2:04:27.180 --> 2:04:29.780]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food
[2:04:29.780 --> 2:04:31.260]  and paying for other necessities.
[2:04:31.260 --> 2:04:33.700]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared,
[2:04:33.700 --> 2:04:35.420]  get self-sufficient, get food.
[2:04:35.420 --> 2:04:36.820]  For everybody out there listening,
[2:04:36.820 --> 2:04:38.300]  it's very important for you to understand
[2:04:38.300 --> 2:04:40.140]  that by having a supply of storable food,
[2:04:40.140 --> 2:04:41.300]  the government, the new old order
[2:04:41.300 --> 2:04:42.940]  has a lot less control over you
[2:04:42.940 --> 2:04:44.140]  and so it's a mindset,
[2:04:44.140 --> 2:04:46.860]  a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[2:04:46.860 --> 2:04:48.540]  No one is gonna take care of your family
[2:04:48.540 --> 2:04:50.100]  in the final equation but you.

[2:04:57.140 --> 2:04:58.820]  and they do it at almost half the cost
[2:04:58.820 --> 2:05:00.380]  of last year's grocery prices.

[2:05:55.540 --> 2:05:59.900]  Okay, David Ike, continuing, for more than 15 years,
[2:05:59.900 --> 2:06:02.420]  you've talked about how the private financial banks
[2:06:02.420 --> 2:06:04.980]  would engineer a crisis, and then out of that,
[2:06:04.980 --> 2:06:07.220]  bring in their world government, they have said,
[2:06:07.220 --> 2:06:09.540]  as we were getting to before we went to break,
[2:06:09.540 --> 2:06:12.620]  at the G20 summit, a new world financial system,
[2:06:12.620 --> 2:06:15.300]  with a world financial bank,
[2:06:15.300 --> 2:06:17.580]  where you will pay your carbon credits directly to them.
[2:06:17.580 --> 2:06:20.140]  I remember seeing that in the Financial Times of London,
[2:06:20.140 --> 2:06:23.180]  and other places, they are now moving us towards that.
[2:06:23.180 --> 2:06:25.380]  So, it looks like their systems imploding,
[2:06:25.380 --> 2:06:27.820]  and that they're laying off all these financial workers,
[2:06:27.820 --> 2:06:29.140]  that's because they don't need the little bees
[2:06:29.140 --> 2:06:30.940]  to gather people's investments.
[2:06:30.940 --> 2:06:32.940]  They're now stealing the pension funds.
[2:06:32.940 --> 2:06:36.060]  We're now, the West is in negative savings,
[2:06:36.060 --> 2:06:38.180]  so they need to destroy the old system,
[2:06:38.180 --> 2:06:41.580]  to build their new system, problem reaction solution,
[2:06:41.580 --> 2:06:43.620]  break that down for us, David Ike.
[2:06:43.620 --> 2:06:45.580]  Yeah, they're talking in Europe,
[2:06:45.580 --> 2:06:47.620]  people like Sarkozy and Gordon Brown,
[2:06:47.620 --> 2:06:50.060]  about a new global financial architecture,
[2:06:50.060 --> 2:06:54.260]  which is all well-speak for this centralised
[2:06:54.260 --> 2:06:56.780]  financial system that will dictate the whole
[2:06:56.780 --> 2:06:59.540]  of global finance from a central point.
[2:06:59.540 --> 2:07:01.060]  This is what they've been working towards,
[2:07:01.060 --> 2:07:03.220]  and it's important to stress that,
[2:07:04.220 --> 2:07:06.420]  you know, when people see the banking system collapsing,
[2:07:06.420 --> 2:07:08.740]  that they think it's bad for the bankers,
[2:07:08.740 --> 2:07:10.860]  well, it's bad for the bankers who lose their jobs,
[2:07:10.860 --> 2:07:12.180]  like you say, the bees,
[2:07:12.180 --> 2:07:14.620]  but it's not bad for the people who own the system.
[2:07:14.620 --> 2:07:16.820]  And this is the point, the families
[2:07:16.820 --> 2:07:19.180]  that we're talking about own the system.
[2:07:19.180 --> 2:07:23.460]  So, if they owned the National Football League,
[2:07:23.460 --> 2:07:26.340]  they couldn't care less if one team beats this team,
[2:07:26.340 --> 2:07:27.620]  or that team beats another team,
[2:07:27.620 --> 2:07:29.940]  because they own the game, they can't lose.
[2:07:29.940 --> 2:07:32.260]  So, when this bank goes down, or that bank goes down,
[2:07:32.260 --> 2:07:34.260]  or this bank's absorbed by this bank,
[2:07:34.260 --> 2:07:36.100]  it doesn't matter to them, what it means is,
[2:07:36.100 --> 2:07:39.100]  there's just fewer names on the doors to deal with.
[2:07:39.100 --> 2:07:42.700]  They own the game, and they're changing the game now
[2:07:42.700 --> 2:07:47.580]  to increase the amount of centralised global control
[2:07:47.580 --> 2:07:50.900]  that will, by definition, increase dramatically
[2:07:50.900 --> 2:07:54.060]  the amount of control over the global population,
[2:07:54.060 --> 2:07:55.540]  which is what money's about.
[2:07:55.540 --> 2:07:59.260]  Money's a vehicle for control, for suppressing potential,
[2:07:59.260 --> 2:08:02.580]  for suppressing choice, for forcing people
[2:08:02.580 --> 2:08:04.660]  into doing things they don't really want to do,
[2:08:04.660 --> 2:08:06.660]  because they have to raise the money
[2:08:06.660 --> 2:08:09.580]  to pay the essential bills to the corporations
[2:08:09.580 --> 2:08:10.820]  that are owned by the same people
[2:08:10.820 --> 2:08:12.460]  that are screwing them financially.
[2:08:12.460 --> 2:08:14.220]  So, we're reaching a point now
[2:08:14.220 --> 2:08:17.980]  where we've gone so far along this road,
[2:08:17.980 --> 2:08:19.900]  while people have been watching game shows,
[2:08:19.900 --> 2:08:22.940]  and watching the soaps, and the football,
[2:08:23.940 --> 2:08:27.180]  and now it's peaked its head into the public arena,
[2:08:27.180 --> 2:08:28.900]  where it's in our face, and people are going,
[2:08:28.900 --> 2:08:30.300]  where did this come from?
[2:08:30.300 --> 2:08:33.020]  Well, it's come from decades, and decades,
[2:08:33.020 --> 2:08:34.980]  indeed, hundreds of years of manipulation
[2:08:34.980 --> 2:08:36.300]  to get us to this point.
[2:08:36.300 --> 2:08:39.460]  And it's a point of great challenge
[2:08:39.460 --> 2:08:41.220]  and great danger in terms of freedom,
[2:08:41.220 --> 2:08:43.660]  but it's also a point of great opportunity,
[2:08:43.660 --> 2:08:46.260]  because you can ignore something
[2:08:46.260 --> 2:08:49.940]  when crazy people like me are going, it's coming.
[2:08:49.940 --> 2:08:51.860]  And you are, no, you're just mad,
[2:08:51.860 --> 2:08:53.100]  you believe, you're reptiles,
[2:08:53.100 --> 2:08:54.900]  you're mad and all this stuff,
[2:08:54.900 --> 2:08:57.380]  but when it's in your face, and it's in your daily life,
[2:08:57.380 --> 2:08:58.940]  you can't look away anymore,
[2:08:58.940 --> 2:09:01.100]  and I'm sure you're finding the same, Alex,
[2:09:01.100 --> 2:09:04.820]  that more and more people who were ignoring it before
[2:09:04.820 --> 2:09:06.420]  are now going, hold on a second,
[2:09:06.420 --> 2:09:07.500]  what can we do about this?
[2:09:07.500 --> 2:09:10.620]  So we're moving into a stage where we can actually,
[2:09:10.620 --> 2:09:14.580]  those that are challenging this tyranny,
[2:09:14.580 --> 2:09:16.620]  this global fascism,
[2:09:16.620 --> 2:09:18.380]  where we can actually go to a stage
[2:09:18.380 --> 2:09:20.540]  of starting to do something about it,
[2:09:20.540 --> 2:09:21.860]  rather than just talk about it.
[2:09:21.860 --> 2:09:24.180]  Okay, David, while you were talking,
[2:09:24.180 --> 2:09:27.540]  I went into Google and Googled World Central Bank
[2:09:27.540 --> 2:09:28.780]  and found hundreds of articles.
[2:09:28.780 --> 2:09:31.980]  Here is Newsweek, why we need a bank of the world,
[2:09:31.980 --> 2:09:33.260]  the financial crisis is global
[2:09:33.260 --> 2:09:35.660]  and only international central bank can deal with it.
[2:09:35.660 --> 2:09:38.580]  Now, already under the IMF World Bank, XM Bank,
[2:09:38.580 --> 2:09:39.940]  in their own documents, they admit
[2:09:39.940 --> 2:09:41.420]  they already are the world central bank,
[2:09:41.420 --> 2:09:44.580]  but under this, they will set interest rates globally,
[2:09:44.580 --> 2:09:46.580]  they will selectively control nations,
[2:09:46.580 --> 2:09:48.900]  they will decide how much currency can be issued,
[2:09:48.900 --> 2:09:50.900]  you'll still have your currencies of the world
[2:09:50.900 --> 2:09:51.900]  in their own words,
[2:09:51.900 --> 2:09:54.380]  if they will just all be regulated and controlled by them,
[2:09:54.380 --> 2:09:56.740]  kind of like the National ID card in the US,
[2:09:56.740 --> 2:09:58.900]  it's the states administering it,
[2:09:58.900 --> 2:10:01.860]  but the feds set it up and control the computer systems,
[2:10:01.860 --> 2:10:03.580]  so it's really a national ID card
[2:10:03.580 --> 2:10:05.620]  tied into a world ID database,
[2:10:05.620 --> 2:10:07.620]  but the public thinks it's a driver's license
[2:10:07.620 --> 2:10:08.780]  when it's really the real ID.
[2:10:08.780 --> 2:10:11.340]  But there is Newsweek, for anyone that doubts this,
[2:10:11.340 --> 2:10:13.740]  and I could sit here showing people hundreds of these
[2:10:13.740 --> 2:10:15.540]  where they are saying,
[2:10:15.540 --> 2:10:17.740]  not just that they're setting up a world central bank,
[2:10:17.740 --> 2:10:20.940]  but that you will pay your taxes on every activity
[2:10:20.940 --> 2:10:24.500]  you are involved in on your carbon footprint to them.
[2:10:24.500 --> 2:10:28.180]  Yeah, and the idea is to eventually get rid of all currencies
[2:10:28.180 --> 2:10:30.780]  for a simple reason, that at the moment,
[2:10:30.780 --> 2:10:34.940]  if you go into a store or you want to buy something anywhere,
[2:10:34.940 --> 2:10:37.340]  and you give them electronic money,
[2:10:37.340 --> 2:10:40.140]  and the computer says no to your credit card,
[2:10:40.140 --> 2:10:42.700]  then at least still, just, just,
[2:10:42.700 --> 2:10:46.060]  you have the opportunity to say, well, I'll pay cash then.
[2:10:46.060 --> 2:10:47.620]  But what they want to do eventually
[2:10:47.620 --> 2:10:49.660]  is take all cash out of circulation,
[2:10:49.660 --> 2:10:52.060]  so that computer, whoever programs it,
[2:10:52.060 --> 2:10:54.100]  decides if and what you purchase.
[2:10:54.100 --> 2:10:56.740]  That's the idea of the cashless society,
[2:10:56.740 --> 2:10:58.180]  which we're hurtling towards,
[2:10:58.180 --> 2:11:01.060]  and that's the next phase that they're looking at
[2:11:01.060 --> 2:11:02.460]  beyond where we are now.
[2:11:02.460 --> 2:11:03.620]  And that's already happening.
[2:11:03.620 --> 2:11:04.980]  You know, we never shop,
[2:11:04.980 --> 2:11:06.980]  we never shop at Walmart here at this office,
[2:11:06.980 --> 2:11:09.300]  but I said, hurry up and get me a Tivo
[2:11:09.300 --> 2:11:11.860]  so I can record things off TV here at the new office,
[2:11:11.860 --> 2:11:14.380]  and the guys went to Walmart without asking me,
[2:11:14.380 --> 2:11:15.820]  I don't micromanage them.
[2:11:15.820 --> 2:11:19.740]  And my guy called, and because he had a debt,
[2:11:19.740 --> 2:11:23.260]  not an unpaid check, but because he had a debt
[2:11:23.260 --> 2:11:25.300]  that he hadn't paid, now the credit scores
[2:11:25.300 --> 2:11:27.300]  tied in with Walmart and other big stores,
[2:11:27.300 --> 2:11:30.420]  they wouldn't let him use that company check
[2:11:30.420 --> 2:11:32.180]  because he had bad credit.
[2:11:32.180 --> 2:11:34.180]  So we're already going into that system,
[2:11:34.180 --> 2:11:37.460]  where, I mean, I see him carting 75-year-old men
[2:11:37.460 --> 2:11:39.620]  buying cigarettes or beer at the store now,
[2:11:39.620 --> 2:11:41.580]  and the corporations admit they're getting us ready
[2:11:41.580 --> 2:11:43.940]  to have to show ID to buy and sell,
[2:11:43.940 --> 2:11:47.900]  and they're gonna have a new world and local sales tax
[2:11:47.900 --> 2:11:49.740]  that will also have a database of everything
[2:11:49.740 --> 2:11:53.940]  you buy, sell, and do in the name of administering the sales tax.
[2:11:53.940 --> 2:11:55.540]  Yeah, and this is happening everywhere.
[2:11:55.540 --> 2:11:58.900]  I mean, in Britain, the big brother state
[2:11:58.900 --> 2:12:03.900]  is hurtling forward, and in terms of the economic situation
[2:12:03.900 --> 2:12:07.380]  here, I mean, it's not really reached the point
[2:12:07.380 --> 2:12:10.100]  that it's gonna reach us, we were talking about earlier,
[2:12:10.100 --> 2:12:13.460]  but when I go around the shops,
[2:12:13.460 --> 2:12:15.340]  which I occasionally do, not very often,
[2:12:15.340 --> 2:12:18.900]  or you go into a pub or a restaurant or something,
[2:12:18.900 --> 2:12:23.140]  places are empty where I go, where they never were before,
[2:12:23.140 --> 2:12:28.500]  and so, you know, we're on the brink of a massive economic
[2:12:28.500 --> 2:12:32.140]  situation here globally, and it's been deliberately engineered
[2:12:32.140 --> 2:12:35.700]  for the ends that we're talking about.
[2:12:35.700 --> 2:12:39.940]  David, how do we get the word out to the people?
[2:12:39.940 --> 2:12:41.460]  And as you said, our credibility is sore
[2:12:41.460 --> 2:12:43.460]  because everything we predicted is now unfolding,
[2:12:43.460 --> 2:12:45.260]  unfortunately, I wish we were wrong.
[2:12:45.260 --> 2:12:47.980]  How do, what are the most, because you're very effective
[2:12:47.980 --> 2:12:51.020]  at unlocking minds, in your educated opinion,
[2:12:51.020 --> 2:12:54.020]  your informed opinion, from experience,
[2:12:54.020 --> 2:12:55.460]  how do we reach out to them and say,
[2:12:55.460 --> 2:12:57.620]  look, it's now here, we're not warning you
[2:12:57.620 --> 2:13:00.380]  about something coming in all the preparatory phase
[2:13:00.380 --> 2:13:02.740]  that was bad enough setting up this tyrannical,
[2:13:02.740 --> 2:13:04.980]  dehumanizing, soul-stealing grid.
[2:13:04.980 --> 2:13:07.980]  We're now entering in to the long slide
[2:13:07.980 --> 2:13:11.260]  into the depths of global mass extermination,
[2:13:11.260 --> 2:13:13.540]  population reduction, because we're not making
[2:13:13.540 --> 2:13:15.740]  even predictions, we're following their own documents,
[2:13:15.740 --> 2:13:19.380]  we know where it goes, can the public face the horror
[2:13:19.380 --> 2:13:22.460]  of what's gonna happen if they keep living in La La Land?
[2:13:23.420 --> 2:13:25.380]  Well, what I say to people is, you know,
[2:13:25.380 --> 2:13:27.660]  if you think you don't like the situation now,
[2:13:27.660 --> 2:13:29.620]  then think what you're gonna face
[2:13:29.620 --> 2:13:32.620]  a little way down the road, and more than anything,
[2:13:32.620 --> 2:13:34.860]  think of what your children are gonna have to face,
[2:13:34.860 --> 2:13:37.140]  because you think that we live in a controlled society now,
[2:13:37.140 --> 2:13:39.420]  this is nothing compared with what they're gonna have
[2:13:39.420 --> 2:13:42.940]  to live in, so in terms of parents
[2:13:42.940 --> 2:13:45.060]  who are listening to this information,
[2:13:45.060 --> 2:13:48.140]  I would say this, go and look your children in the eyes
[2:13:48.140 --> 2:13:50.260]  and tell them that you can't be bothered
[2:13:50.260 --> 2:13:52.460]  or you're too frightened to do anything about it,
[2:13:52.460 --> 2:13:54.060]  you're too frightened to get involved,
[2:13:54.060 --> 2:13:57.020]  too frightened to get involved in being another conduit
[2:13:57.020 --> 2:14:01.060]  for getting this information further and further expanded
[2:14:01.060 --> 2:14:04.900]  into the public mind, that you're too frightened
[2:14:04.900 --> 2:14:06.940]  to get together with others,
[2:14:06.940 --> 2:14:09.380]  to stop cooperating with this system,
[2:14:09.380 --> 2:14:13.980]  and to not be intimidated into coming into line,
[2:14:13.980 --> 2:14:15.820]  which is a bit like coming into line
[2:14:15.820 --> 2:14:20.660]  in a concentration camp and thinking it will be okay
[2:14:20.660 --> 2:14:22.780]  as long as you stay in line and you do as you're told,
[2:14:22.780 --> 2:14:24.700]  you'll be fine, and then you realize at the end of it,
[2:14:24.700 --> 2:14:26.300]  well, actually, it ain't fine,
[2:14:26.300 --> 2:14:28.220]  and if you'd have all rebelled earlier,
[2:14:28.220 --> 2:14:30.620]  that you wouldn't be in the situation you're facing now,
[2:14:30.620 --> 2:14:35.620]  the point of mathematics alone ought to let us see
[2:14:35.780 --> 2:14:37.340]  where the real power is here,
[2:14:37.340 --> 2:14:39.940]  there are billions of people, six billion,
[2:14:39.940 --> 2:14:42.380]  nearly getting off a seven billion on this planet
[2:14:42.380 --> 2:14:44.380]  who are being manipulated.
[2:14:44.380 --> 2:14:47.940]  There are, in full knowledge of what they're doing,
[2:14:47.940 --> 2:14:51.980]  a relative handful of those who are doing the manipulating
[2:14:51.980 --> 2:14:53.380]  to the end that we're talking about.
[2:14:53.380 --> 2:14:56.060]  Because of the compartmentalized pyramids
[2:14:56.060 --> 2:14:58.740]  that they've constructed within all these institutions
[2:14:58.740 --> 2:15:03.020]  of government and finance and corporations,
[2:15:03.020 --> 2:15:08.020]  the vast majority of people who are daily making contributions
[2:15:08.140 --> 2:15:12.300]  to push the world towards this Orwellian global state
[2:15:12.300 --> 2:15:14.580]  have no idea that they're doing that
[2:15:14.580 --> 2:15:16.540]  because they don't know how their contributions
[2:15:16.540 --> 2:15:19.460]  fit in with everyone else's, only the few at the top do.
[2:15:19.460 --> 2:15:22.540]  And what we need to start doing is realizing
[2:15:22.540 --> 2:15:24.860]  that we've reached the fork in the road,
[2:15:24.860 --> 2:15:27.340]  and if we keep going the way we're going,
[2:15:27.340 --> 2:15:29.020]  and we keep putting our heads in the sand,
[2:15:29.020 --> 2:15:31.500]  because you can put your head in a bucket of sand
[2:15:31.500 --> 2:15:34.940]  when a tornado's coming, but it's still coming,
[2:15:34.940 --> 2:15:37.820]  and your bum is still in the air, and it's still coming,
[2:15:37.820 --> 2:15:39.420]  and you're gonna get it eventually,
[2:15:39.420 --> 2:15:40.940]  even though you've ignored the fact
[2:15:40.940 --> 2:15:45.220]  that you have, you know, up to the point where you get hit.
[2:15:45.220 --> 2:15:47.820]  If you lift your head from the sand,
[2:15:47.820 --> 2:15:50.340]  and you look and face the situation,
[2:15:50.340 --> 2:15:53.700]  a tornado's coming, you can now take action
[2:15:53.700 --> 2:15:55.220]  to avoid the consequences.
[2:15:55.220 --> 2:15:57.660]  Exactly, that's where we're looking at now,
[2:15:57.660 --> 2:16:01.420]  and we need to grow up, start being adults,
[2:16:01.420 --> 2:16:03.980]  look at the future our children are gonna have
[2:16:03.980 --> 2:16:07.380]  unless we do something, and get off the back sides,
[2:16:07.380 --> 2:16:09.620]  you know, disconnect them from the sofa,
[2:16:09.620 --> 2:16:11.180]  and let's get this sorted.
[2:16:12.100 --> 2:16:13.900]  Well, absolutely, we're gonna go break and come back
[2:16:13.900 --> 2:16:15.900]  and get more into this mass awakening.
[2:16:15.900 --> 2:16:19.260]  People, and I wanna take on this after the break, David,
[2:16:19.260 --> 2:16:21.900]  people love to say, oh, look at those stupid Jews,
[2:16:21.900 --> 2:16:26.020]  or those stupid Gypsies, or those stupid Anglicans
[2:16:26.020 --> 2:16:29.220]  who didn't like Hitler, and they just went on trains,
[2:16:29.220 --> 2:16:31.700]  and they went to camps, and they stripped down naked,
[2:16:31.700 --> 2:16:33.620]  and they got run into pits and gunned down,
[2:16:33.620 --> 2:16:34.700]  why didn't they fight back?
[2:16:34.700 --> 2:16:38.300]  And we, you know, see those Nazi film footage of that.
[2:16:38.300 --> 2:16:40.340]  When that was done incrementally,
[2:16:40.340 --> 2:16:41.980]  we're gonna come back and get your analysis on this,
[2:16:41.980 --> 2:16:42.860]  that was done incrementally.
[2:16:42.860 --> 2:16:46.180]  They were slowly trained to live in ghettos,
[2:16:46.180 --> 2:16:49.220]  and then to wear yellow stars, or pink triangles,
[2:16:49.220 --> 2:16:52.660]  or whatever the case was, they were slowly trained
[2:16:52.660 --> 2:16:55.980]  by incremental steps to put up with more and more
[2:16:55.980 --> 2:16:58.060]  until, well, now we're taking you here to a camp
[2:16:58.060 --> 2:16:59.900]  to be safe, because the public's beating you up,
[2:16:59.900 --> 2:17:02.180]  and smashing your store windows.
[2:17:02.180 --> 2:17:06.140]  And, you know, now just take your clothes off over here,
[2:17:06.140 --> 2:17:07.220]  we're gonna take care of you,
[2:17:07.220 --> 2:17:08.780]  and then they would line up and see the people
[2:17:08.780 --> 2:17:10.180]  being shot in front of them,
[2:17:10.180 --> 2:17:11.940]  but they would still just run into the pit
[2:17:11.940 --> 2:17:13.820]  obediently to their deaths.
[2:17:13.820 --> 2:17:16.500]  That is mind control, that is incremental conditioning,
[2:17:16.500 --> 2:17:18.140]  and we're going into the same thing
[2:17:18.140 --> 2:17:20.580]  as the ambient tyranny is turned up.
[2:17:20.580 --> 2:17:22.340]  We have to learn to recognize that,
[2:17:22.340 --> 2:17:24.600]  to stop it now, and break our conditioning.
[2:17:24.600 --> 2:17:26.100]  Stay with us with David Ike.
[2:17:28.460 --> 2:17:29.860]  Now that the election is over,
[2:17:29.860 --> 2:17:31.820]  and the shock is beginning to wear off,
[2:17:31.820 --> 2:17:34.620]  ready reserve foods in an effort to get as many Americans
[2:17:34.620 --> 2:17:37.220]  prepared for the promised changes of the new administration,
[2:17:37.220 --> 2:17:38.500]  and to help you and your families
[2:17:38.500 --> 2:17:40.820]  survive the global economic crash.
[2:17:40.820 --> 2:17:43.980]  Ready reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.
[2:17:43.980 --> 2:17:46.900]  Between now and January 20th, 2009,
[2:17:46.900 --> 2:17:49.100]  all food units you won through you seven
[2:17:49.100 --> 2:17:51.220]  are being offered at wholesale prices.
[2:17:51.220 --> 2:17:53.060]  That's a 33% savings.
[2:17:53.060 --> 2:17:56.740]  A year supply of meals starts as low as 73 cents per meal.
[2:17:56.740 --> 2:17:59.220]  Ready reserve food offers only the highest quality
[2:17:59.220 --> 2:18:02.180]  to hydrated food, packed in doubly-nammeled cans
[2:18:02.180 --> 2:18:03.980]  in an inert nitrogen atmosphere,
[2:18:03.980 --> 2:18:06.500]  allowing a 15-plus-year shelf life.
[2:18:06.500 --> 2:18:09.780]  Ready reserve has been manufacturing since 1972,
[2:18:09.780 --> 2:18:12.820]  giving them the freedom to offer you amazing savings.
[2:18:12.820 --> 2:18:16.040]  Great tasting ready reserve foods at wholesale prices.
[2:18:16.040 --> 2:18:19.740]  Order now at readyreservefoods.com, or call today,
[2:18:19.740 --> 2:18:22.820]  1-800-453-2202.
[2:18:22.820 --> 2:18:26.460]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[2:18:27.540 --> 2:18:29.700]  A day unlike any other in the long course
[2:18:29.700 --> 2:18:32.780]  of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:18:32.780 --> 2:18:34.220]  against this country.
[2:18:34.220 --> 2:18:36.860]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:18:36.860 --> 2:18:38.380]  But who is the enemy?
[2:18:38.380 --> 2:18:39.220]  Bin Laden.
[2:18:39.220 --> 2:18:40.340]  This is his MO.
[2:18:40.340 --> 2:18:41.540]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:18:41.540 --> 2:18:43.580]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:18:43.580 --> 2:18:45.620]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[2:18:45.620 --> 2:18:47.620]  to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[2:18:47.620 --> 2:18:50.660]  to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:18:50.660 --> 2:18:53.140]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis,
[2:18:53.140 --> 2:18:57.500]  again, very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[2:18:57.500 --> 2:19:01.380]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:19:01.380 --> 2:19:03.180]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[2:19:03.180 --> 2:19:05.140]  the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[2:19:05.140 --> 2:19:06.620]  the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:19:06.620 --> 2:19:08.220]  the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:19:08.220 --> 2:19:10.300]  warnings in war games, the shadow government,
[2:19:10.300 --> 2:19:12.740]  and much, much more, fabled enemies.
[2:19:12.740 --> 2:19:15.100]  Get the DVD at infowars.com,
[2:19:15.100 --> 2:19:16.900]  or see it in super high quality,
[2:19:16.900 --> 2:19:20.420]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:19:20.420 --> 2:19:24.420]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:19:24.420 --> 2:19:29.420]  Hi, John Humner from Midas Resources.
[2:19:29.420 --> 2:19:31.420]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets
[2:19:31.420 --> 2:19:32.420]  dwindle away?
[2:19:32.420 --> 2:19:34.100]  As government spending is out of hand
[2:19:34.100 --> 2:19:35.420]  and the Federal Reserve is creating
[2:19:35.420 --> 2:19:37.820]  in excess of $20 billion a week,
[2:19:37.820 --> 2:19:40.820]  are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[2:19:40.820 --> 2:19:44.620]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[2:19:44.620 --> 2:19:46.820]  Too many of today's policies resemble those
[2:19:46.820 --> 2:19:49.220]  that led to the collapse of 1929.
[2:19:49.220 --> 2:19:51.220]  How much are you willing to lose?
[2:19:51.220 --> 2:19:52.220]  Take action now.
[2:19:52.220 --> 2:19:57.020]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[2:19:57.020 --> 2:20:00.020]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe
[2:20:00.020 --> 2:20:01.020]  of biblical proportion.
[2:20:01.020 --> 2:20:05.020]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[2:20:05.020 --> 2:20:08.020]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending
[2:20:08.020 --> 2:20:11.020]  have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[2:20:11.020 --> 2:20:17.020]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[2:20:17.020 --> 2:20:20.020]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[2:20:20.020 --> 2:20:29.020]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[2:20:29.020 --> 2:20:33.020]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail,
[2:20:33.020 --> 2:20:35.020]  comes an increase in crime.
[2:20:35.020 --> 2:20:37.020]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[2:20:37.020 --> 2:20:39.020]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[2:20:39.020 --> 2:20:43.020]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[2:20:43.020 --> 2:20:47.020]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[2:20:47.020 --> 2:20:50.020]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market
[2:20:50.020 --> 2:20:53.020]  and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies
[2:20:53.020 --> 2:20:55.020]  from around the world.
[2:20:55.020 --> 2:20:56.020]  Need something more?
[2:20:56.020 --> 2:21:00.020]  The Stinger Keychain is a great way to surprise a potential attacker.
[2:21:00.020 --> 2:21:03.020]  MrDefense carries the largest selection of stun guns,
[2:21:03.020 --> 2:21:06.020]  air tasers, knives, swords, batons,
[2:21:06.020 --> 2:21:09.020]  survival spy and tactical gear.

[2:21:12.020 --> 2:21:14.020]  Visit MrDefense.com.

[2:21:18.020 --> 2:21:21.020]  1-800-313-6400.
[2:21:21.020 --> 2:21:25.020]  That's 1-800-313-6400 today.
[2:21:25.020 --> 2:21:30.020]  I read the news today, oh boy,
[2:21:30.020 --> 2:21:34.020]  about a lucky man who made the great...
[2:21:34.020 --> 2:21:37.020]  If you don't think the global architects running the western world
[2:21:37.020 --> 2:21:40.020]  and the planet won't kill you, won't enslave you,
[2:21:40.020 --> 2:21:43.020]  won't rob your pension funds blind, it's happening.
[2:21:43.020 --> 2:21:45.020]  I just had to laugh.
[2:21:45.020 --> 2:21:48.020]  Just yesterday, I saw a picture of MrDefense
[2:21:48.020 --> 2:21:50.020]  and he said,
[2:21:50.020 --> 2:21:55.020]  you won't rob your pension funds blind, it's happening.
[2:21:55.020 --> 2:21:57.020]  Just yesterday, I saw several mainstream news articles
[2:21:57.020 --> 2:22:00.020]  admitting that British SAS trained Pol Potts people
[2:22:00.020 --> 2:22:04.020]  to kill between 3 and 4 million.
[2:22:04.020 --> 2:22:05.020]  Why did they do this?
[2:22:05.020 --> 2:22:07.020]  We'll talk more about that with David Ike.
[2:22:07.020 --> 2:22:10.020]  David, I went into the mass mind control of people
[2:22:10.020 --> 2:22:12.020]  in Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union,
[2:22:12.020 --> 2:22:14.020]  over and over again who will just march in
[2:22:14.020 --> 2:22:15.020]  and be mowed down and killed.
[2:22:15.020 --> 2:22:17.020]  Why did the founders of this country,
[2:22:17.020 --> 2:22:19.020]  why would they not go along with that?
[2:22:19.020 --> 2:22:20.020]  Why did they fight back?
[2:22:20.020 --> 2:22:21.020]  What's the difference?
[2:22:21.020 --> 2:22:24.020]  How do we get people to psychologically realize
[2:22:24.020 --> 2:22:28.020]  how they're being trained to have this learned helplessness
[2:22:28.020 --> 2:22:31.020]  where they just lay down to the men in black uniforms?
[2:22:31.020 --> 2:22:34.020]  Well, when you're talking about mass mind control,
[2:22:34.020 --> 2:22:37.020]  we can't go any further than Barack Obama
[2:22:37.020 --> 2:22:41.020]  because America has just had visited upon it
[2:22:41.020 --> 2:22:45.020]  a massive mass mind control operation to get him to power
[2:22:45.020 --> 2:22:50.020]  called his ludicrous, ludicrous myth of a personality
[2:22:50.020 --> 2:22:52.020]  and an image that so many people have bought.
[2:22:52.020 --> 2:22:56.020]  I don't know about you, Alex, but I've shaken my head a few times
[2:22:56.020 --> 2:22:58.020]  in the last few months when I've seen people
[2:22:58.020 --> 2:23:01.020]  who I thought had got it to an extent,
[2:23:01.020 --> 2:23:03.020]  who have bought the Obama myth as if somehow
[2:23:03.020 --> 2:23:09.020]  he here out of nowhere is a change to the system
[2:23:09.020 --> 2:23:11.020]  as it works in terms of creating presidents.
[2:23:11.020 --> 2:23:15.020]  Well, to answer your question, what I think of it,
[2:23:15.020 --> 2:23:19.020]  they know things are bad and they want to believe a fairy tale.
[2:23:19.020 --> 2:23:21.020]  They want to think the nightmare is over.
[2:23:21.020 --> 2:23:23.020]  It's exactly because they are somewhat awake
[2:23:23.020 --> 2:23:26.020]  that they're so afraid now at the reality
[2:23:26.020 --> 2:23:30.020]  that they are grasping at straws, seeing things,
[2:23:30.020 --> 2:23:34.020]  mirages in the desert, a man dying of thirst will see huge
[2:23:34.020 --> 2:23:37.020]  lakes of cool, clean water to go drink
[2:23:37.020 --> 2:23:39.020]  and will even go crazy and think he's drinking water
[2:23:39.020 --> 2:23:41.020]  when he's throwing sand into his mouth.
[2:23:41.020 --> 2:23:44.020]  And you've written a great analysis breaking down
[2:23:44.020 --> 2:23:48.020]  the mass mind control, the real programs of Barack Obama.
[2:23:48.020 --> 2:23:50.020]  We link to it at infowars.com to davidike.com.
[2:23:50.020 --> 2:23:53.020]  What's the article, The Emperor with No Clothes?
[2:23:53.020 --> 2:23:55.020]  It's Barack Obama, The Naked Emperor.
[2:23:55.020 --> 2:23:58.020]  You've introduced a very, very important point, Alex,
[2:23:58.020 --> 2:24:00.020]  in terms of mass mind control.
[2:24:00.020 --> 2:24:04.020]  It's the principle of the target wanting it to be true.
[2:24:04.020 --> 2:24:07.020]  And in many ways, the worse it gets,
[2:24:07.020 --> 2:24:12.020]  the more people can be enticed into following someone
[2:24:12.020 --> 2:24:14.020]  who's telling them what they want to be true.
[2:24:14.020 --> 2:24:17.020]  I mean, if you take what happened in Nazi Germany
[2:24:17.020 --> 2:24:20.020]  and those other examples you gave, at each point,
[2:24:20.020 --> 2:24:25.020]  people don't want to face the fact of the situation they're in.
[2:24:25.020 --> 2:24:28.020]  So they will believe when someone tells them,
[2:24:28.020 --> 2:24:31.020]  no, no, it's not that. Just do it for this reason.
[2:24:31.020 --> 2:24:34.020]  They want that to be true and that's the most powerful form
[2:24:34.020 --> 2:24:36.020]  of control.
[2:24:36.020 --> 2:24:38.020]  Absolutely right. What's happened with Barack Obama?
[2:24:38.020 --> 2:24:41.020]  See, this old technique of problem reaction solution,
[2:24:41.020 --> 2:24:44.020]  we're now seeing in America, and indeed globally,
[2:24:44.020 --> 2:24:46.020]  because of Obama's global influence.
[2:24:46.020 --> 2:24:48.020]  I mean, I was in Africa recently a few weeks ago.
[2:24:48.020 --> 2:24:50.020]  I mean, correctly, he's a god there.
[2:24:50.020 --> 2:24:52.020]  I guess you can understand why.
[2:24:52.020 --> 2:24:56.020]  But if they knew that the agenda they have for Africa,
[2:24:56.020 --> 2:24:59.020]  the people behind Obama, then he would be anything but a god.
[2:24:59.020 --> 2:25:04.020]  But the point is that we're seeing a problem reaction solution
[2:25:04.020 --> 2:25:07.020]  in the presidential game here.
[2:25:07.020 --> 2:25:10.020]  They brought Bush in, the people that control Bush, the neocons.
[2:25:10.020 --> 2:25:14.020]  And what they've done for eight years is create massive problems,
[2:25:14.020 --> 2:25:17.020]  financial problems, overseas war problems, military problems,
[2:25:17.020 --> 2:25:19.020]  problems of every kind.
[2:25:19.020 --> 2:25:22.020]  And he was also arrogant and didn't care and lied and said,
[2:25:22.020 --> 2:25:24.020]  I don't read the newspaper. Exactly.
[2:25:24.020 --> 2:25:27.020]  A perfect Psyop, what the Romans would do with a governor,
[2:25:27.020 --> 2:25:30.020]  give them an abusive governor, but then bring in a slicker governor
[2:25:30.020 --> 2:25:32.020]  who could engage in even more abuse than the people
[2:25:32.020 --> 2:25:34.020]  of the Romans of Saviour.
[2:25:34.020 --> 2:25:36.020]  Exactly. You know, one of the interesting things
[2:25:36.020 --> 2:25:39.020]  between the mid-90s and about 2002,
[2:25:39.020 --> 2:25:42.020]  I did enormous amounts of research into mind control,
[2:25:42.020 --> 2:25:44.020]  individual and mass mind control.
[2:25:44.020 --> 2:25:46.020]  And one of the staggering things you came across
[2:25:46.020 --> 2:25:49.020]  when you talk to some of these individual victims of mind control
[2:25:49.020 --> 2:25:53.020]  was that they had a, I wouldn't say a love,
[2:25:53.020 --> 2:25:58.020]  but they had this enormous affection for their controllers
[2:25:58.020 --> 2:26:00.020]  who were abusing them on one level.
[2:26:00.020 --> 2:26:02.020]  It's a strange psychological trait,
[2:26:02.020 --> 2:26:06.020]  but that's what we're seeing on a mass level.
[2:26:06.020 --> 2:26:11.020]  So Obama's come along with people in fear, in outrage,
[2:26:11.020 --> 2:26:15.020]  and anyone who's not Bush, he's got to be better,
[2:26:15.020 --> 2:26:19.020]  and he's come along with his smiling face, the smiling viper,
[2:26:19.020 --> 2:26:22.020]  and now he is going to, from January the 20th,
[2:26:22.020 --> 2:26:28.020]  be offering solutions to the problems that the Bush administration created.
[2:26:28.020 --> 2:26:30.020]  And people see, and all over the world,
[2:26:30.020 --> 2:26:35.020]  they see a change in president as a change in direction.
[2:26:35.020 --> 2:26:41.020]  And all it is, in truth, is a new phase in the same direction
[2:26:41.020 --> 2:26:43.020]  towards this global or well-interpreting...
[2:26:43.020 --> 2:26:45.020]  They're just putting a new quarterback in.
[2:26:45.020 --> 2:26:48.020]  Exactly. And what Obama's been brought in to do,
[2:26:48.020 --> 2:26:53.020]  the salesman, as long as he's reading someone else's words on AutoCube,
[2:26:53.020 --> 2:26:57.020]  is to sell now the solutions to the problems
[2:26:57.020 --> 2:27:03.020]  and these will be all the kind of what they call the global architecture
[2:27:03.020 --> 2:27:05.020]  that we've been talking about all these years,
[2:27:05.020 --> 2:27:08.020]  and it will also be, and we're all already seeing it,
[2:27:08.020 --> 2:27:11.020]  the networks are...
[2:27:11.020 --> 2:27:13.020]  David, stay there, stay there.
[2:27:13.020 --> 2:27:15.020]  We're going to talk about this next phase.
[2:27:15.020 --> 2:27:17.020]  You thought it was bad under Bush? Get ready.
[2:27:17.020 --> 2:27:18.020]  Stay with us.
[2:27:18.020 --> 2:27:22.020]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[2:27:22.020 --> 2:27:27.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:27:52.020 --> 2:27:57.020]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[2:28:22.020 --> 2:28:32.020]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[2:28:32.020 --> 2:28:35.020]  I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do,
[2:28:35.020 --> 2:28:37.020]  or at least we thought we did.
[2:28:37.020 --> 2:28:40.020]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[2:28:40.020 --> 2:28:44.020]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:28:44.020 --> 2:28:50.020]  Whitman, EVA director on the AD made a statement
[2:28:50.020 --> 2:28:53.020]  that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:28:53.020 --> 2:28:56.020]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth
[2:28:56.020 --> 2:29:00.020]  as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:29:00.020 --> 2:29:03.020]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[2:29:03.020 --> 2:29:09.020]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:29:09.020 --> 2:29:12.020]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[2:29:12.020 --> 2:29:16.020]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[2:29:16.020 --> 2:29:21.020]  and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:29:21.020 --> 2:29:23.020]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[2:29:23.020 --> 2:29:27.020]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[2:29:27.020 --> 2:29:31.020]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight?
[2:29:31.020 --> 2:29:36.020]  Only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead or it's just not bright enough.
[2:29:36.020 --> 2:29:38.020]  You need the pack light.
[2:29:38.020 --> 2:29:41.020]  The pack light is the longest lasting flashlight on the market
[2:29:41.020 --> 2:29:45.020]  and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[2:29:45.020 --> 2:29:49.020]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage and home.
[2:29:49.020 --> 2:29:54.020]  The pack light can survive severe impact, be frozen solid and still work flawlessly.
[2:29:54.020 --> 2:29:57.020]  The pack light is so durable, soldiers overseas rely on them
[2:29:57.020 --> 2:30:00.020]  and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker magazine.
[2:30:00.020 --> 2:30:05.020]  The pack light comes with a 25-year warranty and prices startages $12.99.

[2:30:46.020 --> 2:30:49.020]  Welcome back my friends. I want you to be sure you visit his fine website,
[2:30:49.020 --> 2:30:52.020]  scores of books and films and presentations.
[2:30:52.020 --> 2:30:56.020]  Some of the most riveting and informative in mind expanding out there.
[2:30:56.020 --> 2:30:59.020]  DavidIke.com
[2:30:59.020 --> 2:31:04.020]  and when he's on with us we'll also be putting his website up on screen for folks.
[2:31:04.020 --> 2:31:08.020]  We're also simulcasting the radio show right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:31:08.020 --> 2:31:10.020]  There's DavidIke.com on screen.
[2:31:10.020 --> 2:31:14.020]  D-A-V-I-D-I-C-K-E.com
[2:31:14.020 --> 2:31:21.020]  Before we go back to David, the 9-Eleven Chronicles, the 9-Eleven film that shows you the 9-Eleven Truth movement,
[2:31:21.020 --> 2:31:25.020]  police trying to claim they're going to plant bombs on 9-Eleven Truthers in New York,
[2:31:25.020 --> 2:31:28.020]  claiming that cameras are guns, confiscating their cameras,
[2:31:28.020 --> 2:31:33.020]  we had hidden cameras, world leaders being confronted, Barack Obama, Joe Biden,
[2:31:33.020 --> 2:31:36.020]  Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, on and on and on.
[2:31:36.020 --> 2:31:39.020]  This is just such an amazing film. It's Cinema Verite.
[2:31:39.020 --> 2:31:42.020]  There's no voiceover in this. The one film I've made that's Cinema Verite style,
[2:31:42.020 --> 2:31:49.020]  available as low as $6.95 at infowars.com when you get it as part of group combo packages
[2:31:49.020 --> 2:31:51.020]  and make copies of it. Get it out to people.
[2:31:51.020 --> 2:31:56.020]  That's why I've been offered big distribution deals by Universal and people and turned them down
[2:31:56.020 --> 2:32:01.020]  because I wouldn't be able to let you make copies of them, but we still need to sell a few so we can operate here.
[2:32:01.020 --> 2:32:04.020]  Also, my preeminent film on the overall New World Order system in-game,
[2:32:04.020 --> 2:32:07.020]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement, what the elite's mindset is,
[2:32:07.020 --> 2:32:11.020]  how they're setting up the world government, how they plan to exterminate 80-90% of us with their own documents,
[2:32:11.020 --> 2:32:16.020]  the Bilderberg group confronted. It's all there in in-game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[2:32:16.020 --> 2:32:23.020]  We carry a lot of other books and videos like the Money Masters 3.5-hour film for the price of a regular-length film.
[2:32:23.020 --> 2:32:26.020]  You'll have a master's degree in how the private central banks operate
[2:32:26.020 --> 2:32:29.020]  and what they're doing to us with this film at infowars.com.
[2:32:29.020 --> 2:32:34.020]  Jason Burmans' 9-11 film, getting into the Israeli connection, the Pakistani connection,
[2:32:34.020 --> 2:32:39.020]  the NORAD stand down, the Ghost Plains, the Doomsday aircraft running the attacks.
[2:32:39.020 --> 2:32:42.020]  It's just an unbelievable film, the latest 9-11 film out there.
[2:32:42.020 --> 2:32:51.020]  It's Fabled Enemies, also available at infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[2:32:51.020 --> 2:32:55.020]  You can call 24 hours a day asking about the combos and discounts.
[2:32:55.020 --> 2:32:59.020]  Hundreds of films and books and titles, not just my 21 films and the book I wrote
[2:32:59.020 --> 2:33:03.020]  and the other book I published, Paul Watson's Order out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror and the New World Order.
[2:33:03.020 --> 2:33:07.020]  Also, this live TV show will be archived at prisonplanet.tv in high quality
[2:33:07.020 --> 2:33:09.020]  within a few hours of the show being over.
[2:33:09.020 --> 2:33:11.020]  If you're not watching, it's live streaming right now.
[2:33:11.020 --> 2:33:15.020]  When you get home from work or whatever, you can go to prisonplanet.tv
[2:33:15.020 --> 2:33:19.020]  and see this interview in high quality if you're a prisonplanet.tv member of 15 cents a day.
[2:33:19.020 --> 2:33:21.020]  I would also add supporting David Icke's key.
[2:33:21.020 --> 2:33:25.020]  He also has a similar members area of his site, davidike.com.
[2:33:25.020 --> 2:33:28.020]  Okay, David, we've got a long segment here. Let's roll with it.
[2:33:28.020 --> 2:33:33.020]  Break down. I mean, he's clearly doing NLP, Mind Control program, when he gives these speeches,
[2:33:33.020 --> 2:33:37.020]  the way both parties have gotten behind him, the way Pat Robertson is getting behind him,
[2:33:37.020 --> 2:33:40.020]  saying socialism's good, it will save us.
[2:33:40.020 --> 2:33:45.020]  Obama is unstoppable. We have Kissinger saying he is the man, the world's perception.
[2:33:45.020 --> 2:33:48.020]  This is an opportunity for a new world order.
[2:33:48.020 --> 2:33:52.020]  In fact, cue that video up. We'll play a clip of it later, just the part where Kissinger says that
[2:33:52.020 --> 2:33:54.020]  they're halfway through the three-minute clip.
[2:33:54.020 --> 2:33:59.020]  David, break down. David, what's happening with Barack Obama
[2:33:59.020 --> 2:34:03.020]  and how he's being sold and packaged as this Messiah?
[2:34:03.020 --> 2:34:08.020]  Well, what they've done is used all the mass mind control techniques.
[2:34:08.020 --> 2:34:14.020]  And the key one is to turn him over the last year to years into a blank screen
[2:34:14.020 --> 2:34:19.020]  on which the people project their own version of what he is.
[2:34:19.020 --> 2:34:24.020]  And they've done this by ensuring that he never goes into specifics
[2:34:24.020 --> 2:34:26.020]  up to the point where he was elected.
[2:34:26.020 --> 2:34:29.020]  Because once you go into specifics, when you're trying to be elected,
[2:34:29.020 --> 2:34:33.020]  you're already pushing some people away who don't like your specifics.
[2:34:33.020 --> 2:34:36.020]  Ah, so that's what you mean. No, I don't want that.
[2:34:36.020 --> 2:34:42.020]  So what he's done is just continually repeated the mantra of I stand for change,
[2:34:42.020 --> 2:34:46.020]  I stand for hope, and I stand for something to believe in.
[2:34:46.020 --> 2:34:52.020]  Now, the change idea is very effective because of the way the system screws people.
[2:34:52.020 --> 2:34:59.020]  At any point in time, the vast numbers of people are not happy with their status quo,
[2:34:59.020 --> 2:35:03.020]  the way their life is. So anyone who comes along and starts saying,
[2:35:03.020 --> 2:35:07.020]  I will change things is immediately open to that.
[2:35:07.020 --> 2:35:10.020]  Well, I don't like the way things are. Change, yeah, change.
[2:35:10.020 --> 2:35:15.020]  I mean, Clinton did this when he got elected for the first time.
[2:35:15.020 --> 2:35:19.020]  And so they created a blank screen with Obama
[2:35:19.020 --> 2:35:25.020]  on which the people projected their version of what those themes meant.
[2:35:25.020 --> 2:35:28.020]  And so he became all things to all men and all women.
[2:35:28.020 --> 2:35:30.020]  Those who couldn't see through him, that is.
[2:35:30.020 --> 2:35:36.020]  And that's got him elected. And what it's done, and I'm sure that there have been
[2:35:36.020 --> 2:35:40.020]  many other subliminal, even technological, I would say definitely,
[2:35:40.020 --> 2:35:46.020]  technological effects that have been attacks on the human perception
[2:35:46.020 --> 2:35:51.020]  so that they have actually started to see this guy in messianic terms.
[2:35:51.020 --> 2:35:53.020]  I mean, I've spoken to people and I think, you know,
[2:35:53.020 --> 2:35:57.020]  I'm going to click my fingers in a minute, mate, so you wake up when they're talking about this fellow.
[2:35:57.020 --> 2:35:59.020]  And I found that in Africa as well.
[2:35:59.020 --> 2:36:03.020]  So he's going to get this, compared with most presidents,
[2:36:03.020 --> 2:36:07.020]  a really big honeymoon period where he's going to be allowed to get away with a lot of things
[2:36:07.020 --> 2:36:09.020]  that other presidents like Bush wouldn't.
[2:36:09.020 --> 2:36:11.020]  Oh, let's see what Bush is doing. Look how I knew it.
[2:36:11.020 --> 2:36:14.020]  But Obama is going to be different for a while anyway.
[2:36:14.020 --> 2:36:20.020]  And I expect, because they have this agenda and they want to push it on as fast as possible
[2:36:20.020 --> 2:36:27.020]  and they understand this honeymoon period, anything goes for Obama following January the 20th,
[2:36:27.020 --> 2:36:30.020]  that we're going to see things kick off real quick.
[2:36:30.020 --> 2:36:35.020]  We're going to see a blitzkrieg of activity before the public wakes up.
[2:36:35.020 --> 2:36:38.020]  And going back, look at all his betrayals, though,
[2:36:38.020 --> 2:36:43.020]  to get the anti-war movement that swept the Democrats into Congress in 2006
[2:36:43.020 --> 2:36:48.020]  behind him, his handler, who brought him and Governor Blagojevich up,
[2:36:48.020 --> 2:36:52.020]  Rahm Emanuel, who's an IDF officer, not only an American citizen,
[2:36:52.020 --> 2:36:55.020]  or dual citizen, a farm-missile operative,
[2:36:55.020 --> 2:36:59.020]  he openly is the biggest pro-war person in the Democratic Party,
[2:36:59.020 --> 2:37:03.020]  but it's come out now, he told Obama, lie and say you're against it,
[2:37:03.020 --> 2:37:05.020]  and then now he's the chief of staff.
[2:37:05.020 --> 2:37:11.020]  So just incredible betrayal, the wiretapping against the Americans, flip-flop on that.
[2:37:11.020 --> 2:37:14.020]  Now he wants to confront Russia.
[2:37:14.020 --> 2:37:18.020]  I mean, Obama is doing 180 degrees from what he claimed he'd do,
[2:37:18.020 --> 2:37:23.020]  but now he's not saying anything, he's not weighing in on Gaza, on nothing,
[2:37:23.020 --> 2:37:25.020]  he's just sitting there and being our savior.
[2:37:25.020 --> 2:37:29.020]  Well, Obama's not just a blank screen in the way I've just described,
[2:37:29.020 --> 2:37:34.020]  he's also a blank mind in terms of his own intellect.
[2:37:34.020 --> 2:37:38.020]  He's just a frontman, he's a salesman for the people behind him,
[2:37:38.020 --> 2:37:41.020]  and he's not least the big new, Brzezinski.
[2:37:41.020 --> 2:37:44.020]  And it's interesting that if you read Brzezinski's books,
[2:37:44.020 --> 2:37:47.020]  and then you hear Obama's policies, they kind of mirror each other.
[2:37:47.020 --> 2:37:52.020]  I've got a quote here from a Brzezinski book before anyone had heard of Obama nationally,
[2:37:52.020 --> 2:37:55.020]  and it said, this is Brzezinski writing,
[2:37:55.020 --> 2:38:00.020]  needed social reassessment can be encouraged by deliberate civic education
[2:38:00.020 --> 2:38:04.020]  that stresses the notion of service to a higher cause than oneself.
[2:38:04.020 --> 2:38:10.020]  If you have occasionally urged, a major step in that direction would be the adoption of an obligatory period
[2:38:10.020 --> 2:38:12.020]  of national service for every young adult,
[2:38:12.020 --> 2:38:16.020]  perhaps involving a variety of congressionally approved domestical foreign good works.
[2:38:16.020 --> 2:38:19.020]  Now, of course, Obama has been talking about exactly that,
[2:38:19.020 --> 2:38:22.020]  and this is a key phrase here in terms of Obama,
[2:38:22.020 --> 2:38:26.020]  that stresses the notion of service to a higher cause than oneself.
[2:38:26.020 --> 2:38:30.020]  This is going to be one of the great ways that Obama sells the tyranny.
[2:38:30.020 --> 2:38:35.020]  He's going to sell it as people coming together, as serving a higher cause.
[2:38:35.020 --> 2:38:40.020]  And again and again, you hear him, not just him, but his wife as well in some of her speeches,
[2:38:40.020 --> 2:38:46.020]  talk about the fact that America is going to have to sacrifice to bring about this change.
[2:38:46.020 --> 2:38:52.020]  And one of the key sacrifices without any question is going to be sacrificing their sovereignty
[2:38:52.020 --> 2:38:54.020]  and ability to govern themselves.
[2:38:54.020 --> 2:39:00.020]  That's why Colin Powell and Vice President Biden-elect are all saying,
[2:39:00.020 --> 2:39:04.020]  get ready for things that are unpopular when they're speaking to inter-core groups
[2:39:04.020 --> 2:39:07.020]  of Democrats around the country, and it's been caught on tape a few times.
[2:39:07.020 --> 2:39:10.020]  They're saying the people aren't going to like any of this,
[2:39:10.020 --> 2:39:13.020]  and that's raiding the pension funds, starting new wars.
[2:39:13.020 --> 2:39:16.020]  And there's also this classic mind control.
[2:39:16.020 --> 2:39:19.020]  I want you to speak to this particular tactic.
[2:39:19.020 --> 2:39:21.020]  They'll announce we want world government, world government's good,
[2:39:21.020 --> 2:39:24.020]  new world order's good, new order means world government.
[2:39:24.020 --> 2:39:28.020]  Then they'll say, but I didn't just say that, and you're insane if you're against world government.
[2:39:28.020 --> 2:39:32.020]  And if you believe in world government, it exists, and if you think it's good, it exists.
[2:39:32.020 --> 2:39:35.020]  But if you don't want world government, you're insane, it doesn't exist.
[2:39:35.020 --> 2:39:40.020]  And then we've seen, again, all these publications announcing world government in our face.
[2:39:40.020 --> 2:39:42.020]  It's the same thing with Obama.
[2:39:42.020 --> 2:39:50.020]  There's just this almost like they're testing being ridiculous, lying in public, doing asinine things,
[2:39:50.020 --> 2:39:58.020]  and studying reeducation camps in Soviet Russia and communist China.
[2:39:58.020 --> 2:39:59.020]  That's what they did.
[2:39:59.020 --> 2:40:01.020]  They made the interrogations crazy.
[2:40:01.020 --> 2:40:05.020]  They made people change what they were saying and believing every day.
[2:40:05.020 --> 2:40:08.020]  They would say, I'll quit torturing you when you say you agree with this.
[2:40:08.020 --> 2:40:09.020]  Okay, I agree.
[2:40:09.020 --> 2:40:10.020]  They'd still go ahead and torture you.
[2:40:10.020 --> 2:40:12.020]  Now you have to say you believe in that.
[2:40:12.020 --> 2:40:16.020]  And it goes back to O'Brien in 1984 where, of course, Eric Blair, George Arwell,
[2:40:16.020 --> 2:40:22.020]  was writing about being a former secret police member in India and then a propagandist at BBC
[2:40:22.020 --> 2:40:28.020]  at this mind control program of setting the precedence that the police can shoot somebody unarmed,
[2:40:28.020 --> 2:40:31.020]  restrained in the back, and then nobody gets in trouble.
[2:40:31.020 --> 2:40:35.020]  Setting the precedence just for unbelievable corruption.
[2:40:35.020 --> 2:40:41.020]  Yeah, one of the things that they're always doing is pushing things as far as they can,
[2:40:41.020 --> 2:40:44.020]  and they're looking for a public reaction.
[2:40:44.020 --> 2:40:51.020]  If they don't get the public reaction against them that is a problem to them,
[2:40:51.020 --> 2:40:54.020]  then they'll go ahead with whatever they've announced.
[2:40:54.020 --> 2:40:59.020]  If they get a massive public reaction, then they'll just start denying it and saying it's ridiculous
[2:40:59.020 --> 2:41:02.020]  and these people who are saying it are crazy,
[2:41:02.020 --> 2:41:06.020]  and they'll realize that they're going to have to do it in another way,
[2:41:06.020 --> 2:41:08.020]  maybe in two steps rather than one step.
[2:41:08.020 --> 2:41:09.020]  Case in point.
[2:41:09.020 --> 2:41:10.020]  Case in point.
[2:41:10.020 --> 2:41:13.020]  First, they said there was no trans-Texas corridor on CNN and Fox.
[2:41:13.020 --> 2:41:18.020]  Ron Paul was insane that it didn't exist on and on and on and on.
[2:41:18.020 --> 2:41:21.020]  Then they put up the signs, put up a lot of the toll roads,
[2:41:21.020 --> 2:41:25.020]  many of the 8,000 miles of toll roads about 10% were put in place.
[2:41:25.020 --> 2:41:29.020]  Then they came up this week and said, okay, the trans-Texas corridor is dead,
[2:41:29.020 --> 2:41:32.020]  and then they announced a few days later, well, really it's not dead.
[2:41:32.020 --> 2:41:34.020]  We're just breaking all the projects down into sub-pieces,
[2:41:34.020 --> 2:41:39.020]  and we're going to carry out every single bit of seizing your infrastructure
[2:41:39.020 --> 2:41:41.020]  to put international toll roads on it.
[2:41:41.020 --> 2:41:43.020]  So there's the example right there.
[2:41:43.020 --> 2:41:45.020]  Meanwhile, I'm on national radio debates,
[2:41:45.020 --> 2:41:49.020]  and the talk show host laughs at me and says none of this even exists.
[2:41:49.020 --> 2:41:51.020]  That's the way they work.
[2:41:51.020 --> 2:41:59.020]  In terms of Obama, we've got a mass mind control operation behind him
[2:41:59.020 --> 2:42:03.020]  that's far more, well, it's not sophisticated if you know how it works,
[2:42:03.020 --> 2:42:07.020]  but if you don't, it's far more sophisticated than I've come across.
[2:42:07.020 --> 2:42:09.020]  This is really a step up.
[2:42:09.020 --> 2:42:13.020]  Well, you said it, they're using every science they've developed together,
[2:42:13.020 --> 2:42:17.020]  overlaid, working on all 8 cylinders like I've never seen,
[2:42:17.020 --> 2:42:21.020]  and normally they would play off the left-right paradigm with both parties
[2:42:21.020 --> 2:42:25.020]  for the illusion that the Congress and the President really run things
[2:42:25.020 --> 2:42:27.020]  and aren't just front puppets.
[2:42:27.020 --> 2:42:29.020]  For the real guys upstairs, as you've said so many times,
[2:42:29.020 --> 2:42:33.020]  for the first time ever, they're telling us we must be unified,
[2:42:33.020 --> 2:42:38.020]  and for me, that is the signal that they are really moving into a new phase.
[2:42:38.020 --> 2:42:41.020]  Well, it was interesting, years and years ago,
[2:42:41.020 --> 2:42:45.020]  when I was researching this back in the early 90s,
[2:42:45.020 --> 2:42:49.020]  I came across a lady called Kitty Little who was an Oxford Don,
[2:42:49.020 --> 2:42:57.020]  and she told me that she attended a talk by someone at Oxford University
[2:42:57.020 --> 2:43:04.020]  in like the 1940s, and she got into this meeting which was a closed meeting
[2:43:04.020 --> 2:43:07.020]  because they thought she had certain political views and she didn't,
[2:43:07.020 --> 2:43:09.020]  so she was an interloper and they didn't know.
[2:43:09.020 --> 2:43:13.020]  And this man stood up, and he made the speech,
[2:43:13.020 --> 2:43:18.020]  and he said that there was an organization that had no name.
[2:43:18.020 --> 2:43:21.020]  He said, we don't give it a name because it's much more difficult to track it down
[2:43:21.020 --> 2:43:22.020]  if it doesn't have a name.
[2:43:22.020 --> 2:43:26.020]  He said it has a political wing and it has what he called a biological wing.
[2:43:26.020 --> 2:43:30.020]  The head of the biological wing was Lord Richter Rothschild,
[2:43:30.020 --> 2:43:33.020]  and he, he said, was the head of that time of the political wing,
[2:43:33.020 --> 2:43:37.020]  and he said as a result there was going to come a point where he was going to become
[2:43:37.020 --> 2:43:41.020]  Prime Minister of Britain, and his name was Harold Wilson,
[2:43:41.020 --> 2:43:44.020]  and he became Prime Minister of Britain in the early 60s,
[2:43:44.020 --> 2:43:48.020]  and apart from four years until 1975,
[2:43:48.020 --> 2:43:54.020]  but what he said in that speech was that the infiltrators of this conspiracy
[2:43:54.020 --> 2:44:01.020]  were going to go into the left wing, sorry, the right wing of the Labour Party,
[2:44:01.020 --> 2:44:03.020]  which was perceived then as a left wing party,
[2:44:03.020 --> 2:44:06.020]  and they were going to go into the left wing of the Conservative Party,
[2:44:06.020 --> 2:44:08.020]  which was perceived as a right wing party,
[2:44:08.020 --> 2:44:12.020]  because he said people instinctively don't like extremists,
[2:44:12.020 --> 2:44:14.020]  so we're going to pose as moderates.
[2:44:14.020 --> 2:44:20.020]  He said, and what's going to happen is from control of both these parties,
[2:44:20.020 --> 2:44:24.020]  we're going to fuse them together to the point where they become one party
[2:44:24.020 --> 2:44:27.020]  under two names or three names with the Liberal Party.
[2:44:27.020 --> 2:44:32.020]  What has happened in this country, from the end of Margaret Thatcher on,
[2:44:32.020 --> 2:44:37.020]  was particularly when Blair came in, is that is precisely what has happened.
[2:44:37.020 --> 2:44:41.020]  We have three parties in this country, two that have any chance of forming a government,
[2:44:41.020 --> 2:44:44.020]  Labour and Conservative, the Liberal Democrats as well.
[2:44:44.020 --> 2:44:48.020]  You can't hardly, except in rhetoric, get a cigarette paper between them
[2:44:48.020 --> 2:44:52.020]  on most of these things, and the same is happening now in America.
[2:44:52.020 --> 2:44:57.020]  We're reaching this point where the parties are fusing into the one party
[2:44:57.020 --> 2:45:02.020]  that they want them to become, and so we don't have political choice anymore.
[2:45:02.020 --> 2:45:06.020]  Yes, whereas before, they would have little fights with each other
[2:45:06.020 --> 2:45:09.020]  over the power structure, over who got to sit in the seats
[2:45:09.020 --> 2:45:14.020]  and leverage the power to fund themselves and aggrandize themselves.
[2:45:14.020 --> 2:45:18.020]  Now there is no separation, and remember last year, David,
[2:45:18.020 --> 2:45:23.020]  in England it came out that the House of Commons was being spied on by MI5,
[2:45:23.020 --> 2:45:25.020]  all their phones were being listened to,
[2:45:25.020 --> 2:45:29.020]  but that the main focus was on the few little parties that weren't controlled
[2:45:29.020 --> 2:45:32.020]  and that they weren't worried about the three major parties
[2:45:32.020 --> 2:45:36.020]  because those were basically already run by the intelligence apparatus.
[2:45:36.020 --> 2:45:39.020]  Yes, well you've got Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister,
[2:45:39.020 --> 2:45:42.020]  you've got David Cameron, the leader of the opposition.
[2:45:42.020 --> 2:45:45.020]  They use different words and they criticize each other,
[2:45:45.020 --> 2:45:48.020]  and you look at their basic policies and what they would do in power.
[2:45:48.020 --> 2:45:53.020]  It's precisely the same, and so it shows how far along the road we've now come
[2:45:53.020 --> 2:45:59.020]  where even the pseudo fighting that went on before
[2:45:59.020 --> 2:46:02.020]  is now fusing into this one party state,
[2:46:02.020 --> 2:46:09.020]  and what they've done with Obama is turned him into a public demo Republican,
[2:46:09.020 --> 2:46:13.020]  if you like, a Republic Democrat, whatever you want to call it.
[2:46:13.020 --> 2:46:18.020]  They're putting him right in that center ground in the public mind of bringing people together,
[2:46:18.020 --> 2:46:26.020]  but actually he is a massive extremist who owes more to the fascist state of mind,
[2:46:26.020 --> 2:46:29.020]  especially the people behind him than any socialist state of mind,
[2:46:29.020 --> 2:46:33.020]  although if you go far enough left and far enough right, you meet the same situation.
[2:46:33.020 --> 2:46:36.020]  And then we get into colors, using colors to program.
[2:46:36.020 --> 2:46:41.020]  If you notice that he and his wife, the night they won, both wore red and black
[2:46:41.020 --> 2:46:45.020]  and so did their children, again, there's major messages in that.
[2:46:45.020 --> 2:46:52.020]  Yeah, I mean, they understand the way that vibrational codes affect people
[2:46:52.020 --> 2:46:54.020]  and colors are vibrational codes.
[2:46:54.020 --> 2:46:56.020]  They're different colors and they're different shades of color.
[2:46:56.020 --> 2:46:58.020]  And that's the fascist color.
[2:46:58.020 --> 2:47:01.020]  And that's the fascist color, red, black and white.
[2:47:01.020 --> 2:47:05.020]  And it affects you in a certain way, and they speak to the subconscious mind.
[2:47:05.020 --> 2:47:08.020]  But I think one of the key things that we're going to see with Obama
[2:47:08.020 --> 2:47:14.020]  is the creation of a situation where if you're not for him,
[2:47:14.020 --> 2:47:18.020]  then you somehow need to be marginalized.
[2:47:18.020 --> 2:47:20.020]  And you're causing the economy to get worse.
[2:47:20.020 --> 2:47:21.020]  They're already saying that.
[2:47:21.020 --> 2:47:25.020]  If you do exactly what they say and you don't question and you go to the work brigades
[2:47:25.020 --> 2:47:28.020]  and you hand your children over and you spy on your neighbors
[2:47:28.020 --> 2:47:31.020]  and you pay all these carbon taxes, things will be fixed.
[2:47:31.020 --> 2:47:32.020]  That's the solution.
[2:47:32.020 --> 2:47:35.020]  But if you stand in the way of the solution, you've got to be removed
[2:47:35.020 --> 2:47:38.020]  because you're the cause of the problem.
[2:47:38.020 --> 2:47:42.020]  Yeah, I mean, when these demagogues and tyrannies come to power,
[2:47:42.020 --> 2:47:44.020]  I mean, Hitler's a classic example.
[2:47:44.020 --> 2:47:50.020]  Anyone that is against them is attacked, is marginalized, is abused,
[2:47:50.020 --> 2:47:54.020]  is libeled and flandered.
[2:47:54.020 --> 2:48:02.020]  And it's designed to stop people being that nail that stands out above the rest of the Japanese say.
[2:48:02.020 --> 2:48:05.020]  David, we'll come back and continue with that.
[2:48:05.020 --> 2:48:07.020]  I want to talk to you too about a backfire, though.
[2:48:07.020 --> 2:48:09.020]  I'm seeing a backfire here.
[2:48:09.020 --> 2:48:13.020]  Because the system has lost so much credibility, people instinctively now,
[2:48:13.020 --> 2:48:17.020]  they see someone being attacked, think, ah, they must be good.
[2:48:17.020 --> 2:48:21.020]  Okay, so what's happening there is the system loses more and more credibility.
[2:48:21.020 --> 2:48:22.020]  Stay with us.
[2:48:22.020 --> 2:48:24.020]  David Ike, compelling information.
[2:48:24.020 --> 2:48:26.020]  We'll be right back.
[2:48:28.020 --> 2:48:31.020]  So you finally decided you're going to stock up and store food.
[2:48:31.020 --> 2:48:34.020]  But why settle for bland, tasteless food?
[2:48:34.020 --> 2:48:35.020]  Why settle for less?
[2:48:35.020 --> 2:48:37.020]  There is an alternative.
[2:48:37.020 --> 2:48:39.020]  Internetgrocer.net.

[2:48:42.020 --> 2:48:46.020]  Enjoy creamy, delicious, real cheddar cheese in a can.
[2:48:46.020 --> 2:48:49.020]  Endulge in real canned meats and real canned butter.

[2:48:53.020 --> 2:48:56.020]  you won't be able to tell you're actually eating storable food.
[2:48:56.020 --> 2:48:58.020]  You can purchase by the can or by the case.
[2:48:58.020 --> 2:49:01.020]  Choose a variety pack or an entire year's worth of food.
[2:49:01.020 --> 2:49:05.020]  Internetgrocer.net has non-hybrid seeds that will produce delicious food

[2:49:24.020 --> 2:49:27.020]  Again, that's Internet-grocer.net.
[2:49:27.020 --> 2:49:31.020]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[2:49:31.020 --> 2:49:34.020]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:49:34.020 --> 2:49:37.020]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:49:37.020 --> 2:49:38.020]  But who is the enemy?
[2:49:38.020 --> 2:49:39.020]  bin Laden.
[2:49:39.020 --> 2:49:40.020]  This is his MO.
[2:49:40.020 --> 2:49:42.020]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:49:42.020 --> 2:49:44.020]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:49:44.020 --> 2:49:47.020]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[2:49:47.020 --> 2:49:51.020]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:49:51.020 --> 2:49:54.020]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again,
[2:49:54.020 --> 2:49:58.020]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:49:58.020 --> 2:50:02.020]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:50:02.020 --> 2:50:04.020]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[2:50:04.020 --> 2:50:06.020]  the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[2:50:06.020 --> 2:50:07.020]  the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:50:07.020 --> 2:50:09.020]  the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:50:09.020 --> 2:50:10.020]  warnings in war games,
[2:50:10.020 --> 2:50:11.020]  the shadow government,
[2:50:11.020 --> 2:50:12.020]  and much, much more.
[2:50:12.020 --> 2:50:13.020]  Fabled Enemies.
[2:50:13.020 --> 2:50:16.020]  Get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:50:16.020 --> 2:50:18.020]  Or see it in super high quality,
[2:50:18.020 --> 2:50:21.020]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:50:21.020 --> 2:50:28.020]  Whether you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:50:28.020 --> 2:50:31.020]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[2:50:31.020 --> 2:50:34.020]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[2:50:34.020 --> 2:50:37.020]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[2:50:37.020 --> 2:50:40.020]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate
[2:50:40.020 --> 2:50:42.020]  and others are absorbed into the skin.
[2:50:42.020 --> 2:50:46.020]  The KDF dual-media shower filter works with both hot and cold water
[2:50:46.020 --> 2:50:49.020]  and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron.
[2:50:49.020 --> 2:50:53.020]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[2:50:53.020 --> 2:50:57.020]  The KDF dual-media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons
[2:50:57.020 --> 2:50:59.020]  or one year, whichever comes first.
[2:50:59.020 --> 2:51:02.020]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities
[2:51:02.020 --> 2:51:05.020]  use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[2:51:05.020 --> 2:51:06.020]  What about you?
[2:51:06.020 --> 2:51:10.020]  Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for our special price
[2:51:10.020 --> 2:51:12.020]  of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[2:51:52.020 --> 2:52:12.020]  David Ike is our guest for another 40 minutes.
[2:52:12.020 --> 2:52:18.020]  Get up on the phones up in the next hour, 1-800-259-9231.
[2:52:18.020 --> 2:52:21.020]  We're fighting the technological enslavement system.
[2:52:21.020 --> 2:52:24.020]  We're fighting the final revolution of the elite against humanity,
[2:52:24.020 --> 2:52:26.020]  trying to make themselves gods.
[2:52:26.020 --> 2:52:28.020]  I want to get into the genetic engineering,
[2:52:28.020 --> 2:52:31.020]  why they're destroying the environment and the name of saving it.
[2:52:31.020 --> 2:52:34.020]  What their final in-game is if we don't defeat them
[2:52:34.020 --> 2:52:37.020]  and more about us being empowered and taking action
[2:52:37.020 --> 2:52:39.020]  that you speak so elegantly to, David,
[2:52:39.020 --> 2:52:41.020]  but continue with the point you were making
[2:52:41.020 --> 2:52:43.020]  when we got interrupted by the break.
[2:52:43.020 --> 2:52:49.020]  Well, I just feel that Obama is going to be put up there
[2:52:49.020 --> 2:52:52.020]  in a situation where you're either for him
[2:52:52.020 --> 2:52:54.020]  and you're a good guy or you're challenging him
[2:52:54.020 --> 2:52:57.020]  and you're just trying to destroy America.
[2:52:57.020 --> 2:52:59.020]  And the other thing that is going to be played,
[2:52:59.020 --> 2:53:01.020]  although he's talking all the time about,
[2:53:01.020 --> 2:53:03.020]  oh no, racism and all this stuff,
[2:53:03.020 --> 2:53:06.020]  the race card is going to be played as well.
[2:53:06.020 --> 2:53:09.020]  People who attack him, they're going to be called racist
[2:53:09.020 --> 2:53:11.020]  and it's just because he's a black president.
[2:53:11.020 --> 2:53:12.020]  Oh, David, David, David.
[2:53:12.020 --> 2:53:14.020]  I know this has happened to you on my website,
[2:53:14.020 --> 2:53:16.020]  infoworks.com or prismplanet.com.
[2:53:16.020 --> 2:53:19.020]  We'll write an article with Rahm Emanuel saying,
[2:53:19.020 --> 2:53:21.020]  compulsory service will say we're against it
[2:53:21.020 --> 2:53:23.020]  and every other comment is, you just hate black people.
[2:53:23.020 --> 2:53:26.020]  But then I notice it's mainly white yuppies saying it.
[2:53:26.020 --> 2:53:28.020]  Are they programmed or are those disinfo?
[2:53:28.020 --> 2:53:31.020]  Well, that's an interesting point.
[2:53:31.020 --> 2:53:35.020]  And then, you know, I would make this point very strongly.
[2:53:35.020 --> 2:53:38.020]  You know, I've got a great friend in Africa.
[2:53:38.020 --> 2:53:41.020]  He's a Zulu Shaman, a very well-known man in South Africa.
[2:53:41.020 --> 2:53:43.020]  He's in his 80s now.
[2:53:43.020 --> 2:53:47.020]  His perception of Obama is absolutely spot-on.
[2:53:47.020 --> 2:53:49.020]  He wrote a poem that's on your website.
[2:53:49.020 --> 2:53:50.020]  Yeah.
[2:53:50.020 --> 2:53:51.020]  Drop me a few lines from it.
[2:53:51.020 --> 2:53:52.020]  Read the whole poem.
[2:53:52.020 --> 2:53:53.020]  Go ahead.
[2:53:53.020 --> 2:53:54.020]  Okay.
[2:53:54.020 --> 2:53:58.020]  He wrote this poem after he saw Obama speaking on television.
[2:53:58.020 --> 2:54:01.020]  An actor walks upon the floodlit stage of life,
[2:54:01.020 --> 2:54:04.020]  wearing a mask of an angel beneath a demon's crown.
[2:54:04.020 --> 2:54:05.020]  A gown, rather.
[2:54:05.020 --> 2:54:07.020]  Pretends smiles upon the crowded hall of life,
[2:54:07.020 --> 2:54:10.020]  holding out hope as bright as it is false.
[2:54:10.020 --> 2:54:13.020]  Son of a woman in whose veins flows the blood
[2:54:13.020 --> 2:54:15.020]  of ancient island and dark Africa's plains.
[2:54:15.020 --> 2:54:18.020]  You are Obama, nicknamed the Standing King.
[2:54:18.020 --> 2:54:21.020]  You are Barak, O son born to deceive.
[2:54:21.020 --> 2:54:23.020]  The suffering hordes of Africa look up to you.
[2:54:23.020 --> 2:54:27.020]  See a black savior, where naught but a Judah strides.
[2:54:27.020 --> 2:54:30.020]  An entrapper of nations, bringer of dismal war.
[2:54:30.020 --> 2:54:33.020]  Behind the robes and the nylon wings of hope.
[2:54:33.020 --> 2:54:36.020]  O, may those who look up to you see you as you are.
[2:54:36.020 --> 2:54:39.020]  May those who hope in you behold you as you are.
[2:54:39.020 --> 2:54:42.020]  A prince deceitful to bring down Africa's shrines.
[2:54:42.020 --> 2:54:46.020]  A siren who leads Africa's ships onto rocks of obliteration.
[2:54:46.020 --> 2:54:49.020]  Your rule, my lord, will not be one of peace.
[2:54:49.020 --> 2:54:51.020]  Your reign, my king, will not be one of smiles.
[2:54:51.020 --> 2:54:53.020]  And so it goes on.
[2:54:53.020 --> 2:54:58.020]  And some of the people that are going to be most disappointed
[2:54:58.020 --> 2:55:02.020]  about the reign of Barak Obama are going to be the black people of America.
[2:55:02.020 --> 2:55:05.020]  Because he's got a different color skin,
[2:55:05.020 --> 2:55:08.020]  doesn't mean that he has their best interests at heart.
[2:55:08.020 --> 2:55:12.020]  Well, David, the first thing he's doing is massively increasing.
[2:55:12.020 --> 2:55:15.020]  Open you, and even the Huffington Post liberals are reporting this.
[2:55:15.020 --> 2:55:18.020]  Massive forced abortion eugenics funding in Africa.
[2:55:18.020 --> 2:55:20.020]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[2:55:20.020 --> 2:55:23.020]  I mean, he is going after them.
[2:55:23.020 --> 2:55:28.020]  It is rather Brzezinski's agenda for Africa.
[2:55:28.020 --> 2:55:30.020]  He's absolutely grotesque.
[2:55:30.020 --> 2:55:32.020]  And that's what credit much is pointing out here,
[2:55:32.020 --> 2:55:34.020]  what the agenda for Africa is.
[2:55:34.020 --> 2:55:39.020]  But, you know, there is a black overclass in America,
[2:55:39.020 --> 2:55:44.020]  which Prado Mutua describes as white people in black bodies.
[2:55:44.020 --> 2:55:47.020]  And that black overclass does not answer.
[2:55:47.020 --> 2:55:49.020]  This is the Obama's and the Jesse Jackson's
[2:55:49.020 --> 2:55:52.020]  and the Watford Winfrey's and the Jay Z's.
[2:55:52.020 --> 2:55:56.020]  That doesn't answer in terms of its allegiance to black people in general.
[2:55:56.020 --> 2:56:00.020]  It answers to the white overclass, the bloodlines that run the...
[2:56:00.020 --> 2:56:02.020]  Stay there, David. Stay there.
[2:56:02.020 --> 2:56:04.020]  It's a 70-second break.
[2:56:04.020 --> 2:56:33.020]  David, I can the final hour.
[2:56:34.020 --> 2:56:36.020]  This is an independent investigation
[2:56:36.020 --> 2:56:39.020]  in which family members receive answers to their questions
[2:56:39.020 --> 2:56:43.020]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[2:56:43.020 --> 2:56:46.020]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[2:56:46.020 --> 2:56:49.020]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases

[2:57:00.020 --> 2:57:02.020]  While you're visiting the online video store,
[2:57:02.020 --> 2:57:04.020]  there are huge discounts on films like Endgame,
[2:57:04.020 --> 2:57:06.020]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement,
[2:57:06.020 --> 2:57:09.020]  America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[2:57:09.020 --> 2:57:12.020]  We're in a no-holds-far information war.

[2:57:41.020 --> 2:57:46.020]  We'll take five or six phone calls before David Ike
[2:57:46.020 --> 2:57:48.020]  quick questions or comments coming up.
[2:57:48.020 --> 2:57:50.020]  Be with us for the next 40 minutes,
[2:57:50.020 --> 2:57:52.020]  then I'm going to do a news blitz
[2:57:52.020 --> 2:57:54.020]  and have a little special surprise for everybody
[2:57:54.020 --> 2:57:57.020]  right at the end of the show today.
[2:57:57.020 --> 2:57:59.020]  I love surprises.
[2:57:59.020 --> 2:58:03.020]  David Ike, I want to go to calls in about 15 minutes.
[2:58:03.020 --> 2:58:06.020]  Everything you say is so thought-provoking,
[2:58:06.020 --> 2:58:08.020]  I want to back you up and add to what you're saying.
[2:58:08.020 --> 2:58:11.020]  I'm going to attempt to shut up for the next 15 minutes
[2:58:11.020 --> 2:58:14.020]  and let you get into whatever subjects or areas you want,
[2:58:14.020 --> 2:58:17.020]  including solutions that you were finishing up
[2:58:17.020 --> 2:58:22.020]  with the Black Management Overclass of the Judas Code class
[2:58:22.020 --> 2:58:25.020]  that is tied into the New World Order
[2:58:25.020 --> 2:58:27.020]  just as much as George Bush or anybody else.
[2:58:27.020 --> 2:58:29.020]  Please continue.
[2:58:29.020 --> 2:58:35.020]  This Black Overclass answers to the white,
[2:58:35.020 --> 2:58:38.020]  overwhelmingly white network of the Illuminati families,
[2:58:38.020 --> 2:58:41.020]  well, almost entirely white network of the Illuminati families,
[2:58:41.020 --> 2:58:43.020]  and that's their allegiance.
[2:58:43.020 --> 2:58:46.020]  So just because a black face comes into the presidency
[2:58:46.020 --> 2:58:49.020]  or a black face comes into this position or that position
[2:58:49.020 --> 2:58:53.020]  doesn't mean by definition that he has allegiance
[2:58:53.020 --> 2:58:57.020]  to other people of that race in that country.
[2:58:57.020 --> 2:58:59.020]  His allegiance is to himself,
[2:58:59.020 --> 2:59:04.020]  his allegiance therefore is to those that he gets his rewards from
[2:59:04.020 --> 2:59:06.020]  and then he gets his power from.
[2:59:06.020 --> 2:59:10.020]  So he's going to play there a gender out,
[2:59:10.020 --> 2:59:13.020]  not what he's right for the poor black people
[2:59:13.020 --> 2:59:16.020]  and others in America.
[2:59:16.020 --> 2:59:18.020]  And that's what we're going to see,
[2:59:18.020 --> 2:59:20.020]  but he's going to play the race card
[2:59:20.020 --> 2:59:22.020]  or he's going to be played for him,
[2:59:22.020 --> 2:59:24.020]  as you quite rightly quote Emmanuel there,
[2:59:24.020 --> 2:59:27.020]  where anyone who is against him is somehow racist.
[2:59:27.020 --> 2:59:29.020]  I mean, you get this when you challenge Zionism.
[2:59:29.020 --> 2:59:32.020]  You're a racist. No, I'm against slaughtering innocent people.
[2:59:32.020 --> 2:59:34.020]  But we're going to see all of this.
[2:59:34.020 --> 2:59:38.020]  And this is why those that are standing up against this
[2:59:38.020 --> 2:59:41.020]  and those that are becoming aware of it,
[2:59:41.020 --> 2:59:44.020]  we need to get the backbones stiffened up
[2:59:44.020 --> 2:59:47.020]  and we need to do what we know to be right
[2:59:47.020 --> 2:59:50.020]  and not be intimidated by all this stuff that's coming along
[2:59:50.020 --> 2:59:53.020]  and will come along to try to intimidate people into silence,
[2:59:53.020 --> 2:59:56.020]  including, as you're well aware,
[2:59:56.020 --> 2:59:59.020]  talk show hosts where he's even talking about
[2:59:59.020 --> 3:00:04.020]  having to have every side of every story covered
[3:00:04.020 --> 3:00:08.020]  and you can't have an opinion, basically.
[3:00:08.020 --> 3:00:11.020]  Well, it's amazing.
[3:00:11.020 --> 3:00:14.020]  It's that comfort zone you talk about.
[3:00:14.020 --> 3:00:16.020]  We have to get outside the comfort zones.
[3:00:16.020 --> 3:00:18.020]  Those are really little prisons used to control us
[3:00:18.020 --> 3:00:22.020]  and if we don't stop caring when people think about us, it's over.
[3:00:22.020 --> 3:00:24.020]  Yes, it is.
[3:00:24.020 --> 3:00:26.020]  What we've got to do is let go of fear
[3:00:26.020 --> 3:00:28.020]  and what we've got to do is become conscious.
[3:00:28.020 --> 3:00:31.020]  I might be getting into some deep levels here,
[3:00:31.020 --> 3:00:35.020]  but there are many, many different levels to this, Alex.
[3:00:35.020 --> 3:00:39.020]  One of them is very clearly to me after many, many years of this
[3:00:39.020 --> 3:00:42.020]  is that we live in a virtual reality universe
[3:00:42.020 --> 3:00:46.020]  and that this virtual reality universe, this matrix,
[3:00:46.020 --> 3:00:50.020]  is actually founded on a four-letter word, what we call mind.
[3:00:50.020 --> 3:00:53.020]  What we call mind is actually not consciousness.
[3:00:53.020 --> 3:00:56.020]  It is like a computer program.
[3:00:56.020 --> 3:00:59.020]  They're building now biological computers
[3:00:59.020 --> 3:01:03.020]  that don't just have the ability to react to input
[3:01:03.020 --> 3:01:07.020]  and do what they're dictated to do by programmers.
[3:01:07.020 --> 3:01:10.020]  They have the ability of these computers to assess information
[3:01:10.020 --> 3:01:13.020]  and actually make decisions based on that information.
[3:01:13.020 --> 3:01:18.020]  If you go down that road and you increase that by a billion times
[3:01:18.020 --> 3:01:21.020]  in terms of its sophistication and understanding,
[3:01:21.020 --> 3:01:24.020]  which is what we're dealing with in terms of this matrix,
[3:01:24.020 --> 3:01:28.020]  at a physical body, which ticks every box of a computer.
[3:01:28.020 --> 3:01:33.020]  Now, the idea is that we are kept in mind
[3:01:33.020 --> 3:01:36.020]  and people talk about my mind or your mind.
[3:01:36.020 --> 3:01:39.020]  I don't see it like that anymore. I see the mind
[3:01:39.020 --> 3:01:41.020]  and the mind is the matrix.
[3:01:41.020 --> 3:01:45.020]  If you are coming from a position of mind,
[3:01:45.020 --> 3:01:49.020]  in other words, you're identifying yourself with the body,
[3:01:49.020 --> 3:01:53.020]  the reflection in the mirror in the morning, that's me,
[3:01:53.020 --> 3:01:56.020]  then you are operating on the level of mind.
[3:01:56.020 --> 3:01:59.020]  We talk about mind manipulation and mind control.
[3:01:59.020 --> 3:02:01.020]  It's exactly what we're talking about.
[3:02:01.020 --> 3:02:06.020]  They manipulate us by keeping us in this programed sense of awareness
[3:02:06.020 --> 3:02:10.020]  called mind and stopping us becoming truly conscious.
[3:02:10.020 --> 3:02:13.020]  When you become conscious, you can see through the mind game
[3:02:13.020 --> 3:02:15.020]  and what's going on, but when you're in mind,
[3:02:15.020 --> 3:02:19.020]  you're in the game and off the game and therefore you can't see it.
[3:02:19.020 --> 3:02:21.020]  It's like flipping a switch. Stay there.
[3:02:21.020 --> 3:02:24.020]  We've got a break. We'll come back, continue with what you're breaking down,
[3:02:24.020 --> 3:02:28.020]  unlocking the mind to the larger universe and then we'll take phone calls.
[3:02:28.020 --> 3:02:53.020]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever.
[3:02:53.020 --> 3:02:59.020]  When it turned off the telephones and email, they voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[3:02:59.020 --> 3:03:02.020]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[3:03:02.020 --> 3:03:06.020]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing
[3:03:06.020 --> 3:03:11.020]  and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond many Americans' reach.
[3:03:11.020 --> 3:03:18.020]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[3:03:18.020 --> 3:03:22.020]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[3:03:22.020 --> 3:03:28.020]  The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[3:03:28.020 --> 3:03:31.020]  The stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business.
[3:03:31.020 --> 3:03:34.020]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[3:03:34.020 --> 3:03:36.020]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[3:03:36.020 --> 3:03:40.020]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[3:03:40.020 --> 3:03:44.020]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[3:03:44.020 --> 3:03:49.020]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food,
[3:03:49.020 --> 3:03:56.020]  the government, the new-old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[3:03:56.020 --> 3:03:59.020]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[3:03:59.020 --> 3:04:06.020]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports
[3:04:06.020 --> 3:04:09.020]  and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[3:04:09.020 --> 3:04:14.020]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:04:14.020 --> 3:04:20.020]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the final list of high-quality freeze-dried and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[3:04:20.020 --> 3:04:27.020]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[3:04:27.020 --> 3:04:32.020]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:04:32.020 --> 3:04:35.020]  Take action today. The first step is getting storable food.
[3:04:35.020 --> 3:04:48.020]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[3:04:48.020 --> 3:04:57.020]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:04:57.020 --> 3:05:02.020]  Welcome back. We are live at about 52 minutes left in this live broadcast.
[3:05:02.020 --> 3:05:07.020]  Going to your phone calls in about eight, nine minutes, Anna, David, John, Mark, and many others
[3:05:07.020 --> 3:05:10.020]  that are patiently holding before we go back to David Ike.
[3:05:10.020 --> 3:05:16.020]  The sponsor of the day making this transmission possible is survivalistseeds.com.
[3:05:16.020 --> 3:05:21.020]  It's all about getting back to the land. These are heirloom seeds, ladies and gentlemen, heirloom seeds.
[3:05:21.020 --> 3:05:29.020]  No GMO. They're not even hybrid. These are some of these 200, 300-year-old seed varieties.
[3:05:29.020 --> 3:05:34.020]  Some of these came over on the Mayflower. Check out the website, survivalistseeds.com.
[3:05:34.020 --> 3:05:38.020]  Grow your own healthy food with just four pennies a day and break free of the New World Order.
[3:05:38.020 --> 3:05:42.020]  15,000 heirloom seeds will provide you and your family seven years of healthy food.
[3:05:42.020 --> 3:05:47.020]  Stop buying and eating the New World Order GMO food. Start growing real healthy food in your backyard.
[3:05:47.020 --> 3:05:52.020]  15,000 heirloom seeds, a real food insurance policy for difficult times.
[3:05:52.020 --> 3:05:59.020]  Heirloom seeds are the original varieties, non-GMO, non-hybrid. The seeds date back over a century.
[3:05:59.020 --> 3:06:04.020]  The Mayflower bean came over on the Mayflower. Survivalistseeds.com wants you to become one of their heirloom seed farmers
[3:06:04.020 --> 3:06:10.020]  and sell them back your safe seeds year after year because demand is skyrocketing for the rare heirloom seeds.
[3:06:10.020 --> 3:06:16.020]  The globalists are buying up a lot of the companies. The majority of them are not allowing the public to buy them anymore.
[3:06:16.020 --> 3:06:22.020]  So it's harder and harder to get them and they're building all these emergency seed bunkers.
[3:06:22.020 --> 3:06:28.020]  I want to ask separately, David, about the whole biological takeover, why the globalists are just feverishly cross species,
[3:06:28.020 --> 3:06:34.020]  spider goats, cloned milk in stores to the point they're having to label it now cloned or not cloned.
[3:06:34.020 --> 3:06:38.020]  I showed that on TV yesterday. In fact, go grab that out of there for me, please.
[3:06:38.020 --> 3:06:40.020]  I want to show that again. People won't believe it.
[3:06:40.020 --> 3:06:49.020]  Survivalistseeds.com, folks, be sure and check them out today. And please, again, visit infowars.com and prismplanet.com
[3:06:49.020 --> 3:06:54.020]  and check out the films like Endgame, Terror Storm, Truth Rising, Fabled Enemies.
[3:06:54.020 --> 3:07:00.020]  Not only does it support us, but it also gets the word out and people are really ready to hear the truth now.
[3:07:00.020 --> 3:07:07.020]  David, I want to continue with the awakening, but I did want to ask you, are you not pleased?
[3:07:07.020 --> 3:07:12.020]  I mean, I'm seeing in the hundreds of interviews I do every month or so in my own show and people on the street
[3:07:12.020 --> 3:07:17.020]  that the majority of callers to shows are not even my own. It can even be a hostile radio show.
[3:07:17.020 --> 3:07:25.020]  The callers calling and agreeing with me and the people now are really ready to hear the truth
[3:07:25.020 --> 3:07:28.020]  and I see a paradigm shift and I think that's why the globalists are crashing things,
[3:07:28.020 --> 3:07:34.020]  so that they can be the only savior and feed the people and clothe the people bringing us into this collectivist model.
[3:07:34.020 --> 3:07:41.020]  I mean, is not this whole new order takeover a response to their attempt to fully dominate us before we break free of their conditioning?
[3:07:41.020 --> 3:07:46.020]  Absolutely. I mean, I've been writing for years that there was a change coming,
[3:07:46.020 --> 3:07:53.020]  a change coming that was going to wake up vast, vast numbers of people, like a spiritual alarm clock,
[3:07:53.020 --> 3:07:58.020]  if you like, waking people up. And waking people up is absolutely the phrase.
[3:07:58.020 --> 3:08:05.020]  It's breaking the amnesic state that people live in. And, you know, going back to what I was talking about before the break,
[3:08:05.020 --> 3:08:09.020]  you know, this is a big focus, the focus of my work at this time.
[3:08:09.020 --> 3:08:16.020]  And I'm accumulating now enormous amounts of information about the fact that this is a virtual reality universe
[3:08:16.020 --> 3:08:24.020]  and what we call mind is a construct of this virtual reality, this matrix.
[3:08:24.020 --> 3:08:34.020]  And if you are stuck in mind, then you are a program, basically, of the matrix, of the virtual reality game,
[3:08:34.020 --> 3:08:44.020]  and it runs your perception. What is happening in this awakening is a consciousness is starting to break through
[3:08:44.020 --> 3:08:51.020]  what I call real consciousness, not mind, which is a very, very low level of awareness and perceptions,
[3:08:51.020 --> 3:08:55.020]  what we call intellect. It's stupid compared with consciousness.
[3:08:55.020 --> 3:08:59.020]  Consciousness is starting to break through and connect into more and more people.
[3:08:59.020 --> 3:09:09.020]  And when you do that, instead of looking close up at a brick symbolically, you are, as you become more and more conscious,
[3:09:09.020 --> 3:09:12.020]  you're moving further and further back from the brick to the top of the hill.
[3:09:12.020 --> 3:09:18.020]  And now you see that what you were looking at, the brick was actually part of a house, which was part of a street,
[3:09:18.020 --> 3:09:24.020]  which was part of a city, which was part of a country, et cetera, you're seeing what you were in.
[3:09:24.020 --> 3:09:32.020]  And you're seeing that what you thought was freedom is actually fundamentally manipulated tyranny and control.
[3:09:32.020 --> 3:09:38.020]  So you start to see the game because like a stooge of a hypnotist in a state show,
[3:09:38.020 --> 3:09:44.020]  when you are programmed to believe that there's an elephant in the audience, you see an elephant in the audience,
[3:09:44.020 --> 3:09:51.020]  you believe anything as long as it's programmed in because that means that your brain starts reading reality
[3:09:51.020 --> 3:09:58.020]  like a computer reading software that fits in with what it's been programmed to read, i.e. you're eating a potato,
[3:09:58.020 --> 3:10:00.020]  but it's actually an apple and that's what you taste.
[3:10:00.020 --> 3:10:09.020]  So what's happening with this awakening, Alex, is as people break out of the amnesic state controlled by mind into consciousness,
[3:10:09.020 --> 3:10:16.020]  they're starting to see what they couldn't see before. People say to be, it's so obvious, mate, why didn't I see it before?
[3:10:16.020 --> 3:10:21.020]  Because you were entrapped in mind, now you're becoming conscious, you can see it.
[3:10:21.020 --> 3:10:25.020]  And the whole conspiracy is about holding us in a state of mind.
[3:10:25.020 --> 3:10:32.020]  If you look at society, Alex, it worships the mind, it always got a great mind, it always got a great intellect.
[3:10:32.020 --> 3:10:40.020]  You know when I talk to so-called elite Oxford students sometimes, they're the most difficult people to talk to
[3:10:40.020 --> 3:10:42.020]  compared with the general public about these things.
[3:10:42.020 --> 3:10:50.020]  But some old starving person in Venezuela on the street, or sometimes a poor homeless person, I'll talk to him,
[3:10:50.020 --> 3:10:55.020]  you'll just think they're some old drunk and it turns out they're incredibly aware and tuned into the universe
[3:10:55.020 --> 3:10:57.020]  and even know what you're thinking.
[3:10:57.020 --> 3:11:04.020]  They get it, but people who have been through the system, particularly the elite ones who have been through the system
[3:11:04.020 --> 3:11:13.020]  to a greater level than anyone else, they're programming into mind, into intellect, which is a desperately stupid
[3:11:13.020 --> 3:11:15.020]  compared with consciousness level of awareness.
[3:11:15.020 --> 3:11:22.020]  Because they're so specialized, they're so specialized to be inserted into the interlocking pyramids you talk so much about.
[3:11:22.020 --> 3:11:25.020]  Yeah, this is the whole point, you know, Alex, when you look at it.
[3:11:25.020 --> 3:11:33.020]  The whole system, the whole education system is designed to turn out mind-intellects.
[3:11:33.020 --> 3:11:37.020]  It's about passing exams, which is what?
[3:11:37.020 --> 3:11:40.020]  Taking information that they tell you to believe.
[3:11:40.020 --> 3:11:41.020]  And regurgitating.
[3:11:41.020 --> 3:11:46.020]  You're just taking it out onto exam paper and the better you do that, the more you progress within the system.
[3:11:46.020 --> 3:11:54.020]  You then get degrees in famous universities and then you specialize, you go into medicine, you go into science,
[3:11:54.020 --> 3:11:57.020]  you go into whatever, and then you go through the same system on a higher level.
[3:11:57.020 --> 3:12:03.020]  And those are the people that then get appointed to run the system, to run medicine, to run science,
[3:12:03.020 --> 3:12:05.020]  to run this, to run the other.
[3:12:05.020 --> 3:12:10.020]  And by the time they get to those positions where they run society, they're completely encased and controlled
[3:12:10.020 --> 3:12:13.020]  by this low level of awareness called intellect.
[3:12:13.020 --> 3:12:22.020]  And therefore society reflects their perception of the world, i.e. we live in a society based on intellect and mind.
[3:12:22.020 --> 3:12:27.020]  When you become conscious, the world changes and your world changes.
[3:12:27.020 --> 3:12:35.020]  You see, people encased in mind in Israel as we speak will justify the slaughter of Palestinian people.
[3:12:35.020 --> 3:12:36.020]  They're in that tiny paradigm.
[3:12:36.020 --> 3:12:37.020]  They're in that tiny paradigm.
[3:12:37.020 --> 3:12:39.020]  They must stop her mass.
[3:12:39.020 --> 3:12:45.020]  But there are some fantastic people in Israel, Israelis, young people particularly, who are conscious
[3:12:45.020 --> 3:12:48.020]  and consciousness is telling them this is wrong.
[3:12:48.020 --> 3:12:53.020]  And they're the ones that are refusing to serve in the military and going to jail as a result.
[3:12:53.020 --> 3:13:02.020]  Because consciousness is getting them to see the situation from the point of view of what's right, what's just, what's fair,
[3:13:02.020 --> 3:13:06.020]  rather than from mind, which sees things in people.
[3:13:06.020 --> 3:13:14.020]  Well, they're also fundamentally getting out of just their earth suit and realizing they're not Israelis, they're human beings,
[3:13:14.020 --> 3:13:15.020]  or they're not.
[3:13:15.020 --> 3:13:17.020]  Exactly, that's what consciousness does.
[3:13:17.020 --> 3:13:23.020]  Consciousness, when you become conscious, the physical body becomes a vehicle to experience this reality.
[3:13:23.020 --> 3:13:28.020]  It doesn't become who you are and then racism and division through race and division through country
[3:13:28.020 --> 3:13:34.020]  suddenly starts to fall and we start to realize we're all one consciousness having different experiences.
[3:13:34.020 --> 3:13:35.020]  Okay, start.
[3:13:35.020 --> 3:13:36.020]  What's happened Alex?
[3:13:36.020 --> 3:13:39.020]  And the conspiracy is fundamentally set up to do this.
[3:13:39.020 --> 3:13:48.020]  The idea is to get us to identify who we are with our experience rather than what we really are, which is consciousness having the experience.
[3:13:48.020 --> 3:13:54.020]  Instead of being our base, you know, galactic programming of this ancient species in this wondrous universe,
[3:13:54.020 --> 3:14:01.020]  they're trying to give us the new false programming to stay within that very limited spectrum, as you talk so much about.
[3:14:01.020 --> 3:14:03.020]  And we're almost out of time and I promise to go to call.
[3:14:03.020 --> 3:14:04.020]  So we're going to go to break in a moment.
[3:14:04.020 --> 3:14:07.020]  We're going to come back and take calls for two short segments with David.
[3:14:07.020 --> 3:14:09.020]  We've got to have you back soon, David.
[3:14:09.020 --> 3:14:11.020]  We're very thankful and appreciative of your important time.
[3:14:11.020 --> 3:14:17.020]  And I know the audience is, but briefly in the three minutes before break, the genetic engineering, the cloning of the milk,
[3:14:17.020 --> 3:14:25.020]  all of this that is now going on and happening, the cross species engineering, the mass poisoning of the public.
[3:14:25.020 --> 3:14:35.020]  Why is the elite pushing to destroy the biosphere of the earth while grandstanding and claiming they've got to have world taxes to save it with carbon dioxide that's a red herring?
[3:14:35.020 --> 3:14:38.020]  Why did they want to destroy the earth and hurt the environment?
[3:14:38.020 --> 3:14:41.020]  Well, this actually goes on for what we've been talking about.
[3:14:41.020 --> 3:14:46.020]  If you take one step back and you start to see what we're dealing with here from that point of view, particularly from that point of view,
[3:14:46.020 --> 3:14:49.020]  the human body is a computer system.
[3:14:49.020 --> 3:14:53.020]  And what we call genetics is actually a computer program.
[3:14:53.020 --> 3:15:01.020]  And what they're doing by messing with genetically modified food and all these other changes in the nature of what we eat and drink
[3:15:01.020 --> 3:15:07.020]  is they are manipulating, destabilizing and manipulating the body computer program.
[3:15:07.020 --> 3:15:10.020]  On one level, the body is an electrochemical organism.
[3:15:10.020 --> 3:15:17.020]  So if you destabilize it electromagnetically or chemically, you're destabilizing it.
[3:15:17.020 --> 3:15:20.020]  You're stopping it working efficiently.
[3:15:20.020 --> 3:15:28.020]  You're stopping it being a highly efficient receiver transmitter for consciousness to experience through it and to influence its behavior.
[3:15:28.020 --> 3:15:31.020]  You're disconnecting it from consciousness.
[3:15:31.020 --> 3:15:36.020]  Which is what the mercury and the poisons and the GMO, and we get the government documents,
[3:15:36.020 --> 3:15:40.020]  and we get them out of England and out of Russia and the US.
[3:15:40.020 --> 3:15:46.020]  It says we got a poison when they're young, so they never fully develop and they're literally like biological androids.
[3:15:46.020 --> 3:15:48.020]  That's exactly the game.
[3:15:48.020 --> 3:15:54.020]  And this is why, again, the point you made earlier, and I've been talking about this for years,
[3:15:54.020 --> 3:16:01.020]  a massive assault on human freedom, on the human body, on the human mind is because of this period of change,
[3:16:01.020 --> 3:16:07.020]  this cycle is coming and it's working people up and they're desperately trying to keep the lid down
[3:16:07.020 --> 3:16:10.020]  so that they can control for the next cycle.
[3:16:10.020 --> 3:16:18.020]  And therefore, they're attacking the young particularly because they're going to be the adult people as this cycle really unfolds
[3:16:18.020 --> 3:16:23.020]  and therefore they need to destabilize them and that's why their food and drink is attacked more than anyone.
[3:16:23.020 --> 3:16:25.020]  And that's why we've got the kids being put on Riddle and Prozac.
[3:16:25.020 --> 3:16:30.020]  David, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, I'm only doing it in one segment today because time's precious.
[3:16:30.020 --> 3:16:34.020]  We're going to talk behind scenes for the PrisonPlanet.tv and Internet listeners right now.
[3:16:34.020 --> 3:16:36.020]  They'll come back to your calls after break. Stay with us.
[3:16:36.020 --> 3:16:38.020]  Okay, John, I'm going to skip this break.
[3:16:38.020 --> 3:16:42.020]  David, we are just on the Internet audience now because I promised to come back to calls.
[3:16:42.020 --> 3:16:45.020]  Let's put bookends on what you just said.
[3:16:45.020 --> 3:16:51.020]  I just read the other day in the New York Times, 100 million people on serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone.
[3:16:51.020 --> 3:16:56.020]  If that isn't THX 1138 Brave New World, I don't know what is.
[3:16:56.020 --> 3:17:01.020]  They're attacking the police, the military, the citizens, all of us are in this together.
[3:17:01.020 --> 3:17:07.020]  And isn't that the great final illusion is that people that work for the system feel like they're part of the elite
[3:17:07.020 --> 3:17:13.020]  when even high level elites are being poisoned by their own system and that's why people say it's a spiritual thing.
[3:17:13.020 --> 3:17:20.020]  There's almost this cosmic force and you get into that but I just can see that it's there driving man towards destroying themselves
[3:17:20.020 --> 3:17:24.020]  and it's overall a hatred of the species.
[3:17:24.020 --> 3:17:31.020]  Yeah, the thing is that I say to these people in uniform, you know, I say to them, you know, you've got no power.
[3:17:31.020 --> 3:17:36.020]  You know, there's some people that love the uniform because they think they've got power and I say to them, you've got no power.
[3:17:36.020 --> 3:17:40.020]  Your power is what you put on in the morning when you open the wardrobe.
[3:17:40.020 --> 3:17:44.020]  The uniform you wear is an extension of the state.
[3:17:44.020 --> 3:17:50.020]  When you wear the uniform, you're an extension of the state, when you take the uniform off, you have no power.
[3:17:50.020 --> 3:17:52.020]  And the only power you have is off the state.
[3:17:52.020 --> 3:17:57.020]  You're just another pawn in the game while thinking you are higher than the other pawns that you're policing.
[3:17:57.020 --> 3:18:09.020]  And these are the levels of society, these polices of society which Obama wants to massively increase with his networks of civilian security.
[3:18:09.020 --> 3:18:14.020]  These are the people that need to wake up and need to realize that they have children too.
[3:18:14.020 --> 3:18:23.020]  I know of one who's, I in NATO, who's just realized, he said he looked in the eyes of his four-year-old grandchild and said,
[3:18:23.020 --> 3:18:30.020]  I can't do this anymore because I know what I'm contributing to now and he's trying to get information out about what's going on.
[3:18:30.020 --> 3:18:36.020]  This is what we need to do. The polices need to realize that they are the pawns also.
[3:18:36.020 --> 3:18:43.020]  Well, I was talking to a top doctor who's treated ahead of state and this head of state said,
[3:18:43.020 --> 3:18:47.020]  you know, I was grown up to, you know, that we have to exterminate 80% of people to keep the resources,
[3:18:47.020 --> 3:18:51.020]  but I look at people and I know it's evil and I don't want to be part of this.
[3:18:51.020 --> 3:18:55.020]  I mean, a lot of people in the system are having an awakening too, aren't they?
[3:18:55.020 --> 3:18:59.020]  Yes, they are. There's so much to be optimistic about.
[3:18:59.020 --> 3:19:02.020]  I mean, the challenges are there. Of course they are. They want to push this on.
[3:19:02.020 --> 3:19:13.020]  And they want to push it on faster and faster now because they are desperately trying to stop this awakening manifest to such an extent that their house of cards comes down.
[3:19:13.020 --> 3:19:16.020]  So those challenges are there and they're going to push on through Obama,
[3:19:16.020 --> 3:19:25.020]  but there's so much to be enthusiastic and encouraged about because there is fantastic changes going on in the awareness of so many people.
[3:19:25.020 --> 3:19:32.020]  David, as you said, though, in the one minute before we come back quickly, I'd say Obama has two or three or four months when he first gets in
[3:19:32.020 --> 3:19:38.020]  until people wake up to that phase of the illusion so they want to start a big war, a biological release or a financial collapse.
[3:19:38.020 --> 3:19:44.020]  What do we do to expose this guy and stop him being able to carry the ball for the New World Order in the first few months?
[3:19:44.020 --> 3:19:53.020]  Well, all we've got to do is keep working this information out and people who are listening to this information don't be a cul-de-sac for information.
[3:19:53.020 --> 3:19:56.020]  And when you receive the information, there is a responsibility.
[3:19:56.020 --> 3:19:58.020]  Pass it on, pass it on, pass it on.
[3:19:58.020 --> 3:20:04.020]  By word of mouth, you can inform vast numbers of people very quickly if enough people do it.
[3:20:04.020 --> 3:20:06.020]  That's what we need to do.
[3:20:06.020 --> 3:20:11.020]  You're right, and we have incredible power that we better use it now because they are planning to shut down the old web.
[3:20:11.020 --> 3:20:16.020]  The inventor of the web said a few days ago that, quote, it's going to die.
[3:20:16.020 --> 3:20:17.020]  They're letting it die.
[3:20:17.020 --> 3:20:18.020]  It's being killed.
[3:20:18.020 --> 3:20:20.020]  So we need to move right now.
[3:20:20.020 --> 3:20:28.020]  Folks, we're coming out of this break with only prisonplanet.tv viewers and infowars.com exclusive stream listeners tuning in,
[3:20:28.020 --> 3:20:33.020]  though we do have tens of thousands tuning in on the free streams and quite a few watching on prisonplanet.tv.
[3:20:33.020 --> 3:20:36.020]  We're coming out right now with David Ike with your calls. Here we go.
[3:20:36.020 --> 3:20:45.020]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:20:45.020 --> 3:20:49.020]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:20:49.020 --> 3:20:55.020]  The New World Order, with its programmers, admit that they're colonizing our minds, our souls.
[3:20:55.020 --> 3:21:01.020]  They are keeping us weak, confused, dumbed down in fighting.
[3:21:01.020 --> 3:21:02.020]  But the awakening is happening.
[3:21:02.020 --> 3:21:06.020]  David Ike, amazing guest, is our guest right now.
[3:21:06.020 --> 3:21:08.020]  DavidIke.com is the website.
[3:21:08.020 --> 3:21:09.020]  We'll put that up on screen.
[3:21:09.020 --> 3:21:12.020]  Let's go to Ryan, first time caller from Georgia.
[3:21:12.020 --> 3:21:14.020]  You're on the air with David Ike.
[3:21:14.020 --> 3:21:24.020]  Yes, how you doing, Alex? First off, I just really want to tell you, I'm very appreciative of this waking me up and informing me of all the information that's currently going on.
[3:21:24.020 --> 3:21:29.020]  And second, I just really want to say by far, I've been wanting to say this for a long time,
[3:21:29.020 --> 3:21:38.020]  Lindsay Williams, David Ike, Steve Quill, and Tex Mars are by far your most important guests that you have on your show.
[3:21:38.020 --> 3:21:44.020]  And I would just really appreciate it if you can even get them on even more, because every time they speak,
[3:21:44.020 --> 3:21:51.020]  they get really straight into the point and they inform us with information of how these people are thinking,
[3:21:51.020 --> 3:21:53.020]  and pretty much what their next steps are going to be.
[3:21:53.020 --> 3:21:56.020]  Hey, listen, I mean, I'd have David on every week or two if he'd do it.
[3:21:56.020 --> 3:22:01.020]  He's just very, very busy, but he has been agreeing to come on every month and a half or so.
[3:22:01.020 --> 3:22:03.020]  So I hope we can continue having David on, David.
[3:22:03.020 --> 3:22:05.020]  Yeah, well, that'd be great.
[3:22:05.020 --> 3:22:06.020]  Well, thanks very much, Ryan.
[3:22:06.020 --> 3:22:07.020]  Thanks very much for that.
[3:22:07.020 --> 3:22:10.020]  I'll give you an example of how things are moving on, though.
[3:22:10.020 --> 3:22:13.020]  I'm coming to America in about 10 days.
[3:22:13.020 --> 3:22:15.020]  I'm going to be there for about two and a half months.
[3:22:15.020 --> 3:22:19.020]  I'm talking in Los Angeles on the 16th for seven hours, and then I'm going down to speaking Mexico.
[3:22:19.020 --> 3:22:22.020]  And after that, I'm going all over the world.
[3:22:22.020 --> 3:22:23.020]  I'm going to Greece.
[3:22:23.020 --> 3:22:24.020]  I'm going to Australia.
[3:22:24.020 --> 3:22:28.020]  I'm going to South America, to Brazil.
[3:22:28.020 --> 3:22:29.020]  I'm going to Croatia.
[3:22:29.020 --> 3:22:31.020]  I'm going to all these different places.
[3:22:31.020 --> 3:22:35.020]  And a few years ago, Crikey, I couldn't fill a phone box in England.
[3:22:35.020 --> 3:22:38.020]  So this is the scale of the awakening that's going on.
[3:22:38.020 --> 3:22:48.020]  And we have to balance the things that are happening that we don't like with the fact that there is a terrific global awakening going on.
[3:22:48.020 --> 3:22:51.020]  Of course, it doesn't get in the mainstream media, so most people don't think it exists.
[3:22:51.020 --> 3:22:56.020]  But I've been to 47 countries now, and it's happening all over the world.
[3:22:56.020 --> 3:22:58.020]  Well, David, I look at your website traffic.
[3:22:58.020 --> 3:22:59.020]  I look at my website traffic.
[3:22:59.020 --> 3:23:02.020]  It's all going straight up on the Google Trends.
[3:23:02.020 --> 3:23:05.020]  And by the way, I talked to David a month and a half ago, and he was on.
[3:23:05.020 --> 3:23:07.020]  He's agreed to come to Austin.
[3:23:07.020 --> 3:23:08.020]  I'm going to set that up.
[3:23:08.020 --> 3:23:10.020]  It'll probably be, I have to talk to you.
[3:23:10.020 --> 3:23:16.020]  I have to probably talk to you in the next few days so I can go ahead and decide on a venue and set it up and get you over here for maybe a two-day event.
[3:23:16.020 --> 3:23:18.020]  The problem is, is getting a big enough venue.
[3:23:18.020 --> 3:23:19.020]  You can probably get 5,000 people.
[3:23:19.020 --> 3:23:21.020]  I can probably get 5,000.
[3:23:21.020 --> 3:23:24.020]  And so, but I need to find a time that's good for you.
[3:23:24.020 --> 3:23:27.020]  I need to nail that down and do that here in Austin, Texas.
[3:23:27.020 --> 3:23:28.020]  I think that's the place to do it.
[3:23:28.020 --> 3:23:32.020]  So, I'll let that out of the bag. David's agreed to come here and speak with myself.
[3:23:32.020 --> 3:23:34.020]  And he'll do his presentation.
[3:23:34.020 --> 3:23:37.020]  I'll do a briefer PowerPoint presentation.
[3:23:37.020 --> 3:23:38.020]  So that's coming up.
[3:23:38.020 --> 3:23:42.020]  The two of us teaming up because we all have to come together during this critical time.
[3:23:42.020 --> 3:23:44.020]  I appreciate your call, Ryan.
[3:23:44.020 --> 3:23:46.020]  Anna in Idaho, you're on the air.
[3:23:46.020 --> 3:23:48.020]  Go ahead.
[3:23:48.020 --> 3:23:49.020]  Hello, can you hear me?
[3:23:49.020 --> 3:23:51.020]  Yes, Anna, you're on the air.
[3:23:51.020 --> 3:23:55.020]  I have to agree with the caller that was just on Ryan.
[3:23:55.020 --> 3:24:00.020]  I love it when you have David Iker, Steve Quayle.
[3:24:00.020 --> 3:24:02.020]  I just wanted to say thank you.
[3:24:02.020 --> 3:24:03.020]  I'm a huge fan.
[3:24:03.020 --> 3:24:06.020]  I wish you could go on tour.
[3:24:06.020 --> 3:24:08.020]  I want to meet you in person.
[3:24:08.020 --> 3:24:10.020]  And that's all I wanted to say is thank you.
[3:24:10.020 --> 3:24:12.020]  Thank you to you and to David and everything you do.
[3:24:12.020 --> 3:24:13.020]  Oh, thank you very much.
[3:24:13.020 --> 3:24:15.020]  Well, that's all you.
[3:24:15.020 --> 3:24:17.020]  Absolutely.
[3:24:17.020 --> 3:24:20.020]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Montreal, Canada.
[3:24:20.020 --> 3:24:22.020]  You're on the air with David Iker.
[3:24:22.020 --> 3:24:23.020]  Yay.
[3:24:23.020 --> 3:24:24.020]  How's it going?
[3:24:24.020 --> 3:24:27.020]  I'm very happy to finally be able to speak to you both.
[3:24:27.020 --> 3:24:29.020]  I'm the webmaster of CriticalUnity.org,
[3:24:29.020 --> 3:24:33.020]  and I syndicate a lot of both of your articles and videos on my site.
[3:24:33.020 --> 3:24:37.020]  As David mentioned, people need to take a good look at the big picture
[3:24:37.020 --> 3:24:41.020]  and not be intimidated by the elites' manipulation and scare tactics.
[3:24:41.020 --> 3:24:45.020]  The playing of the racial card is the only possible,
[3:24:45.020 --> 3:24:48.020]  because racism was indirectly created by the elites
[3:24:48.020 --> 3:24:51.020]  by molding our world views as a fascism unfolds.
[3:24:51.020 --> 3:24:55.020]  Those who supported Obama or any of these bloodlines, they're waking up,
[3:24:55.020 --> 3:24:58.020]  and we will stand against the corruption no matter what they throw at us.
[3:24:58.020 --> 3:25:01.020]  Our world, our lives, and our freedoms are at stake here,
[3:25:01.020 --> 3:25:04.020]  because the people have been at the mercy of the malevolent.
[3:25:04.020 --> 3:25:10.020]  Sorry, I'm a bit nervous, but we've been at the mercy of these malevolent,
[3:25:10.020 --> 3:25:12.020]  first that have taken over our planet,
[3:25:12.020 --> 3:25:15.020]  but people are ready to hear the truth that as long as the majority
[3:25:15.020 --> 3:25:20.020]  has no opportunity to even know about InfoWars, DavidIke.com, or my site,
[3:25:20.020 --> 3:25:22.020]  how will they wake up?
[3:25:22.020 --> 3:25:24.020]  Well, we're doing that now, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[3:25:24.020 --> 3:25:26.020]  I mean, I'm not exaggerating when I say it.
[3:25:26.020 --> 3:25:29.020]  Without even looking, I can spend 10, 15 minutes on YouTube
[3:25:29.020 --> 3:25:33.020]  and count up videos that people are posting of my TV show or audio,
[3:25:33.020 --> 3:25:36.020]  and it's over a million a week, just with that.
[3:25:36.020 --> 3:25:38.020]  You know, I produce films that have been seen,
[3:25:38.020 --> 3:25:41.020]  what I can look on hit counters, a piece tens of millions of times on the web,
[3:25:41.020 --> 3:25:43.020]  and that now is the new medium,
[3:25:43.020 --> 3:25:46.020]  and people made tens of millions of copies of the tens of thousands of videos
[3:25:46.020 --> 3:25:48.020]  I've shipped out, same thing with David.
[3:25:48.020 --> 3:25:51.020]  So, look at the newspapers failing.
[3:25:51.020 --> 3:25:54.020]  Look at mainstream media losing its ratings, while alternative explodes.
[3:25:54.020 --> 3:25:57.020]  So, the word is getting out, isn't it, David?
[3:25:57.020 --> 3:26:01.020]  It is, and we're heading towards a real explosion,
[3:26:01.020 --> 3:26:06.020]  because the curve in awakening is getting really exponential
[3:26:06.020 --> 3:26:09.020]  and starting to go upwards very fast.
[3:26:09.020 --> 3:26:13.020]  This is a great time, and you know, it's not a time to get fearful
[3:26:13.020 --> 3:26:16.020]  and it's not a time to get depressed, although there are many reasons to do that.
[3:26:16.020 --> 3:26:18.020]  It's a collision course. Hold on, David.
[3:26:18.020 --> 3:26:21.020]  We're going to skip this one, too, in the time that we have
[3:26:21.020 --> 3:26:23.020]  a just-represent planet on TV viewers for everybody else.
[3:26:23.020 --> 3:26:26.020]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[3:26:26.020 --> 3:26:30.020]  Okay, David, continue with what you were saying there.
[3:26:30.020 --> 3:26:35.020]  You know, the exponential curve is now heading straight upwards,
[3:26:35.020 --> 3:26:41.020]  because as more and more people understand the basics of what are going on,
[3:26:41.020 --> 3:26:43.020]  they talk to more people, and the whole thing expands.
[3:26:43.020 --> 3:26:46.020]  So, you reach a point eventually when it's an explosion,
[3:26:46.020 --> 3:26:48.020]  and we're absolutely on the cusp of that now.
[3:26:48.020 --> 3:26:51.020]  In fact, we're already beginning to see some of it.
[3:26:51.020 --> 3:26:53.020]  So, you know, this is a wonderful time.
[3:26:53.020 --> 3:26:57.020]  This is not a time to get depressed and run away
[3:26:57.020 --> 3:27:01.020]  and try to find some, you know, some land to hide in away from everybody.
[3:27:01.020 --> 3:27:03.020]  This is a time to run straight at this,
[3:27:03.020 --> 3:27:07.020]  because these people, I absolutely have no doubt whatsoever,
[3:27:07.020 --> 3:27:12.020]  are starting to panic about what's happening in terms of public awareness of their game.
[3:27:12.020 --> 3:27:16.020]  If you go to Google Trends and look at DavidIke.com,
[3:27:16.020 --> 3:27:19.020]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Rents.com,
[3:27:19.020 --> 3:27:24.020]  all the hundreds of huge sites, my two are the biggest individually.
[3:27:24.020 --> 3:27:26.020]  InfoWars is the largest alternative site.
[3:27:26.020 --> 3:27:29.020]  PrisonPlanet is the second largest, and there's Rents and Ike and others.
[3:27:29.020 --> 3:27:33.020]  If you look at them on the trends, it looks like this.
[3:27:33.020 --> 3:27:37.020]  I want to zoom in on this on the PrisonPlanet.tv camera over here if we can.
[3:27:37.020 --> 3:27:42.020]  And this is basically what the trend looks from 2003 when they started Google Trends,
[3:27:42.020 --> 3:27:45.020]  tracking all the sites to 2008.
[3:27:45.020 --> 3:27:47.020]  You can go pull these up on the Google Trends site.
[3:27:47.020 --> 3:27:49.020]  Anyone can look at this for themselves.
[3:27:49.020 --> 3:27:55.020]  And the curve, the growth curve is exactly the same for all of these alternative media,
[3:27:55.020 --> 3:28:00.020]  consciousness expanding, you know, live breaking websites.
[3:28:00.020 --> 3:28:03.020]  It is hyperbolic, it is straight up DavidIke.
[3:28:03.020 --> 3:28:11.020]  Yeah, so anyone that's sitting out there and is sort of frightened about doing anything
[3:28:11.020 --> 3:28:16.020]  or getting involved or the rest of it, you know, there are millions and millions
[3:28:16.020 --> 3:28:20.020]  and millions and millions of people gathering now all over the world.
[3:28:20.020 --> 3:28:25.020]  We just need to get together and deal with this because we're in a position now
[3:28:25.020 --> 3:28:29.020]  where we're heading to a time when we can.
[3:28:29.020 --> 3:28:34.020]  You know, I look back a few years and my goodness me, you thought, well, is anything going to change?
[3:28:34.020 --> 3:28:39.020]  But, crikey, this is Dreamland compared to where we were a few years ago.
[3:28:39.020 --> 3:28:41.020]  Well, just God bless you, David.
[3:28:41.020 --> 3:28:45.020]  And again, I've said this the last two times you've been on, but people still try to make hay out of it
[3:28:45.020 --> 3:28:48.020]  and you intelligently ignore it.
[3:28:48.020 --> 3:28:52.020]  They probably interviewed me for three hours off and on about you
[3:28:52.020 --> 3:28:54.020]  when a British crew was here for Channel 4.
[3:28:54.020 --> 3:29:00.020]  And the one little smart-ass thing I shattened up being in the film about you being a turd in the punch bowl
[3:29:00.020 --> 3:29:03.020]  because people weren't ready to accept some of the things you were saying
[3:29:03.020 --> 3:29:05.020]  and then I would have trouble with the basics.
[3:29:05.020 --> 3:29:08.020]  And I've apologized for that, but I'm going to do it again
[3:29:08.020 --> 3:29:10.020]  because you've been so big about it and forgiven me.
[3:29:10.020 --> 3:29:15.020]  And also because I know that information is used out there still by people to try to drive a wedge.
[3:29:15.020 --> 3:29:18.020]  So I'll say it again. I apologize.
[3:29:18.020 --> 3:29:20.020]  No problem, Alex.
[3:29:20.020 --> 3:29:24.020]  We all have different opinions at different times and they're not always correct.
[3:29:24.020 --> 3:29:26.020]  We all grow. We all grow.
[3:29:26.020 --> 3:29:31.020]  Of course we do. And what we need to do is drop anything that divides us.
[3:29:31.020 --> 3:29:37.020]  Any fault lines, any of this nonsense because together we're going to sort this divided we're not.
[3:29:37.020 --> 3:29:39.020]  Well, I think all of us that are awakening are right.
[3:29:39.020 --> 3:29:41.020]  It's just we've got different perspectives.
[3:29:41.020 --> 3:29:42.020]  Exactly.
[3:29:42.020 --> 3:29:44.020]  And then I just had a chance to move and see things from different angles.
[3:29:44.020 --> 3:29:50.020]  Let's go ahead and I mean, what's different from what you're saying about an evil overarching force behind it all
[3:29:50.020 --> 3:29:52.020]  with what Christians are saying? Really?
[3:29:52.020 --> 3:29:53.020]  Again, it's all perspective.
[3:29:53.020 --> 3:29:56.020]  Let's go ahead and go back to the full transmission.
[3:29:56.020 --> 3:30:02.020]  It's over. Everybody knows the good guy's lost.
[3:30:02.020 --> 3:30:07.020]  Everybody knows the fight was fixed.
[3:30:07.020 --> 3:30:09.020]  The poor stay poor.
[3:30:09.020 --> 3:30:10.020]  The rich stay poor.
[3:30:10.020 --> 3:30:16.020]  Final segment with David and Ike only have time to take a few final calls with him because I have some special information I'm going to be covering.
[3:30:16.020 --> 3:30:19.020]  Everybody knows.
[3:30:19.020 --> 3:30:22.020]  Let's go ahead and jam in.
[3:30:22.020 --> 3:30:24.020]  Who is up next here, John?
[3:30:24.020 --> 3:30:25.020]  I got confused with the calls.
[3:30:25.020 --> 3:30:26.020]  Mark and P.A.?
[3:30:26.020 --> 3:30:27.020]  Oh, John and Canada.
[3:30:27.020 --> 3:30:31.020]  John and Canada, you're on the air with David Ike.
[3:30:31.020 --> 3:30:33.020]  How's it going there, Alex?
[3:30:33.020 --> 3:30:34.020]  Good, sir.
[3:30:34.020 --> 3:30:35.020]  Awesome.
[3:30:35.020 --> 3:30:43.020]  I just want to thank you guys very much for giving us like an alternate source of international news right now and enjoy your show greatly.
[3:30:43.020 --> 3:30:52.020]  Alex, did you know that this last Christmas here in Canada was the first white one that we've had across the country since like 1974?
[3:30:52.020 --> 3:31:02.020]  Yes, global cooling is happening because the sun has the first time in 300 years of recording it, no sunspots which are the huge flares.
[3:31:02.020 --> 3:31:05.020]  And so the earth is rapidly cooling.
[3:31:05.020 --> 3:31:11.020]  This is another area, Alex and John, where Obama comes into play.
[3:31:11.020 --> 3:31:16.020]  It's another one of his solutions in the agenda behind him.
[3:31:16.020 --> 3:31:29.020]  People will have noticed that his, if you like, environmental energy, science advisor, network of people are all, if you like, worshippers of Al Gore's version of global warming.
[3:31:29.020 --> 3:31:42.020]  And you're going to see Barack Obama pushing forward policies, ludicrous policies to deal with a problem that's not actually caused by what they claim it is.
[3:31:42.020 --> 3:31:47.020]  Yeah, and well, we just missed the big carbon tax thing here with the last election.
[3:31:47.020 --> 3:31:49.020]  It was one of the main platforms for liberal party.
[3:31:49.020 --> 3:31:55.020]  And I've talked to some people about the liberal party and how they're involved with, it's not just a liberal party now either.
[3:31:55.020 --> 3:32:03.020]  It's all conservatives who are involved with the power corporation of Canada, who in turn is also linked with the genocide in Sudan.
[3:32:03.020 --> 3:32:14.020]  And every prime minister we've had in Canada almost, since Trudeau, including Trudeau, has all been on the board of directors for the power corporation of Canada.
[3:32:14.020 --> 3:32:21.020]  And Paul Volcker actually was on the International Advisory Committee as well.
[3:32:21.020 --> 3:32:27.020]  And you tell people this and they go, oh, that's just business. It's got nothing to do with politics.
[3:32:27.020 --> 3:32:34.020]  They have a country. They have no comments. Business in terms of the Illuminati is control.
[3:32:34.020 --> 3:32:37.020]  I mean, that's what business is for. They're just arms of control.
[3:32:37.020 --> 3:32:48.020]  This is why when I hear people of the left dismissing the global conspiracy and saying globalization is just greedy corporations, it's not greedy corporations.
[3:32:48.020 --> 3:32:54.020]  Corporations are a vehicle for this network to impose globalization and centralized control on the planet.
[3:32:54.020 --> 3:32:57.020]  They're not the origin of it. They're the vehicle for it.
[3:32:57.020 --> 3:32:59.020]  And the elites admit they're setting up a world dictatorship.
[3:32:59.020 --> 3:33:02.020]  That's what elites have always tried to get total domination.
[3:33:02.020 --> 3:33:06.020]  And to deny that is to deny history. Thank you so much, John.
[3:33:06.020 --> 3:33:10.020]  Quickly, Mark and Pennsylvania, you're on the air with David Icke. The one and the only.
[3:33:10.020 --> 3:33:12.020]  Hello, this is Mark.
[3:33:12.020 --> 3:33:14.020]  Hello, Mark.
[3:33:14.020 --> 3:33:23.020]  Hello. I want to thank both of you for opening my perceptions as well as many others around the planet to the truth of what is really happening.
[3:33:23.020 --> 3:33:30.020]  And one thing that I'm pretty much a nontraditionalist and nonconformist, but there's many out there who aren't.
[3:33:30.020 --> 3:33:39.020]  And they're busy doing what they're doing and they're following what they believe in the good of government.
[3:33:39.020 --> 3:33:41.020]  They want to believe in the good in their community and all of this.
[3:33:41.020 --> 3:33:44.020]  But the reality is these things are happening and they're not even aware of it.
[3:33:44.020 --> 3:33:49.020]  Well, when I start to share these things as well as others, I'm sure I'm not alone.
[3:33:49.020 --> 3:33:55.020]  When you share these ideas, these perceptions with people, at first they look at you like, oh, that can't be.
[3:33:55.020 --> 3:33:57.020]  And then they look at you. Then they're in shock.
[3:33:57.020 --> 3:33:59.020]  And then they're like the deer and the headlights.
[3:33:59.020 --> 3:34:10.020]  So what comes up to me, and I appreciate very much that you guys are opening our perceptions to these things that are happening and continuing to investigate and research and find out what they're continuing to do.
[3:34:10.020 --> 3:34:17.020]  But here's the thing. When it comes down to it, people are in shock at first and then they don't know what to do.
[3:34:17.020 --> 3:34:26.020]  So I've watched your show or listened to your show, Alex, many, many times, and I've read your materials, Mr. Ike.
[3:34:26.020 --> 3:34:35.020]  And the thing about it is when you boil all down, people don't know what to do, like taking simple steps of what to do to respond.
[3:34:35.020 --> 3:34:38.020]  All right, I hear you. We have to end this here in just a moment. I'm going to let you go and I'm sorry.
[3:34:38.020 --> 3:34:41.020]  No more time to go to Tim, Rob and many others that are holding.
[3:34:41.020 --> 3:34:43.020]  And I want David to be able to close out in the last minute here.
[3:34:43.020 --> 3:34:48.020]  Last time we had David on the time before that, he went through. Just say no to National ID cards.
[3:34:48.020 --> 3:34:51.020]  Say no to giving up your personal information. Start growing a garden.
[3:34:51.020 --> 3:34:54.020]  Start talking to your neighbors about the elite.
[3:34:54.020 --> 3:35:01.020]  The awakening is the solution, overturning the false paradigm, expanding the horizon, David.
[3:35:01.020 --> 3:35:08.020]  Yeah, once you break out of mind of the program and into consciousness, then you instinctively know what your contribution is.
[3:35:08.020 --> 3:35:16.020]  And you go for it because when you become conscious, you let go of one of the great expressions of the mind construct, which is fear.
[3:35:16.020 --> 3:35:30.020]  But also, you know, this relatively tiny network that's manipulating the lives of billions can only do it with the help and support and subservience of the billions.
[3:35:30.020 --> 3:35:32.020]  They can't do it otherwise.
[3:35:32.020 --> 3:35:42.020]  And if we stop cooperating en masse in all these areas that Alex just listed and many others, then the system cannot work.
[3:35:42.020 --> 3:35:48.020]  It can't. They can't impose their will on billions of people and let the billions accept it.
[3:35:48.020 --> 3:35:54.020]  What would happen if everybody wrote infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or davidike.com on all the paper money?
[3:35:54.020 --> 3:35:57.020]  That's already waking up. A lot of people come to the cider because people are doing that.
[3:35:57.020 --> 3:36:02.020]  What would happen if people made copies of my films or handed out davidike documentaries?
[3:36:02.020 --> 3:36:07.020]  Well, what is happening? We're seeing we're having an effect. We've just got to push that much harder.
[3:36:07.020 --> 3:36:11.020]  David, when's a good time because I forgot that I invited you to tell me you agreed when you were on a month ago.
[3:36:11.020 --> 3:36:19.020]  When's a good time to call and talk to you and try to look at some calendars and figure out when it's good say four or five months in the future to get you to Austin, Texas?
[3:36:19.020 --> 3:36:22.020]  Tomorrow's fine or Monday's fine.
[3:36:22.020 --> 3:36:27.020]  Okay, I'll call you tomorrow because I'm going to be out of town a little bit next week. Jason Bermas is going to be sitting in for a few days.
[3:36:27.020 --> 3:36:30.020]  But I will call you what in the evening?
[3:36:30.020 --> 3:36:31.020]  Yeah, that'd be great.
[3:36:31.020 --> 3:36:36.020]  Well, David, we really appreciate your time. davidike.com. Folks, check it out there. Great materials.
[3:36:36.020 --> 3:36:38.020]  And we appreciate everything you're doing, David.
[3:36:38.020 --> 3:36:40.020]  Thanks, Alex. Thank you.
[3:36:40.020 --> 3:36:41.020]  You bet. Take care.
[3:36:41.020 --> 3:36:42.020]  Cheers.
[3:36:42.020 --> 3:36:48.020]  There goes David Ike from the United Kingdom joining us for the last hour and 40 minutes.
[3:36:48.020 --> 3:36:54.020]  Okay, what is the surprise today? Well, it's not Alex Jones tyranny crusher one.
[3:36:54.020 --> 3:36:56.020]  This was the first time we ever did an eBay item.
[3:36:56.020 --> 3:37:00.020]  And the reason we did it is because people are like, well, this megaphone's broken.
[3:37:00.020 --> 3:37:02.020]  We bought a new one. You've had this one for all these years.
[3:37:02.020 --> 3:37:06.020]  It's in the movie, a scanner darkly that they wrote a scope. That's really me in the bullhorn in there.
[3:37:06.020 --> 3:37:10.020]  We'll play a clip of that in a moment.
[3:37:10.020 --> 3:37:12.020]  This isn't the surprise surprise coming up in a minute.
[3:37:12.020 --> 3:37:19.020]  Tyranny crusher one, you know, should we get it fixed like $125 megaphone or should we sell it and obviously it's a fundraiser.
[3:37:19.020 --> 3:37:24.020]  We're not saying the megaphone just as a megaphone is worth $3,500.
[3:37:24.020 --> 3:37:26.020]  I think it's the latest bid on there for it.
[3:37:26.020 --> 3:37:28.020]  We opened it up at 1500.
[3:37:28.020 --> 3:37:32.020]  There is tyranny crusher one on the prison planet dot TV screen.
[3:37:32.020 --> 3:37:38.020]  This is and then I saw this info shills on the comments on that article going, how dare you try to make money?
[3:37:38.020 --> 3:37:42.020]  Again, when the establishment taxes are money uses against us, I'm not supposed to try to fund things.
[3:37:42.020 --> 3:37:44.020]  So I have a good mic to get the voice out there.
[3:37:44.020 --> 3:37:49.020]  Well, to give you a good, you know, show of information to have these guests on to have a producer to schedule it to have.
[3:37:49.020 --> 3:37:51.020]  I mean, it's asinine.
[3:37:51.020 --> 3:37:59.020]  And so because the establishments criticizing me for trying to fund this operation, which is like a peace shooter against their propaganda,
[3:37:59.020 --> 3:38:04.020]  but having a great effect on, you know what, just because of you establishment folks, go ahead and send me checks.
[3:38:04.020 --> 3:38:07.020]  You want to donate $100, $1,000, $5, whatever.
[3:38:07.020 --> 3:38:11.020]  You have my word that 95% of that money that comes in here will be used.
[3:38:11.020 --> 3:38:14.020]  The other 5% for me to live and, you know, wear this on TV.
[3:38:14.020 --> 3:38:19.020]  So it goes across well to folks and all the rest of it because it's my whole passion.
[3:38:19.020 --> 3:38:25.020]  As if we can't have a political or sociological passion and then fund our operation or we can't sell our books.
[3:38:25.020 --> 3:38:31.020]  But everybody else in the establishment, they can sell their books and get $10 million a year to read off a teleprompter on the nightly news.
[3:38:31.020 --> 3:38:34.020]  There's no teleprompter here, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:38:34.020 --> 3:38:39.020]  This is my heart and soul and my intellect and my research and the guess we bring you here and all the people we build up.
[3:38:39.020 --> 3:38:41.020]  So, you know what?
[3:38:41.020 --> 3:38:45.020]  I want to see $50,000 bid for Terany Crusher 1.
[3:38:45.020 --> 3:38:47.020]  I mean, I know we got some big donors out there.
[3:38:47.020 --> 3:38:48.020]  I mean, you know what?
[3:38:48.020 --> 3:38:52.020]  Because we're going to use, in fact, I'll use 100% of Terany Crusher 1's money.
[3:38:52.020 --> 3:38:58.020]  100% of Terany Crusher 1's money because we spent over 100 grand on this little studio.
[3:38:58.020 --> 3:38:59.020]  And folks, that's cheap.
[3:38:59.020 --> 3:39:00.020]  You're like, well, that's expensive.
[3:39:00.020 --> 3:39:02.020]  We have the cheapest switcher they make that's new.
[3:39:02.020 --> 3:39:05.020]  20-something grand, you know, and the cameras and all of it.
[3:39:05.020 --> 3:39:07.020]  We're trying to really develop and expand this.
[3:39:07.020 --> 3:39:10.020]  It's having a huge effect now with just this new look that's not even that fancy.
[3:39:10.020 --> 3:39:14.020]  Instead of the videos on YouTube, each one every day, getting 10,000 views a day.
[3:39:14.020 --> 3:39:16.020]  It's like 60, 70, 100,000 views per day.
[3:39:16.020 --> 3:39:19.020]  I mean, it's getting crazy all because of presentation.
[3:39:19.020 --> 3:39:26.020]  I'm going to have professional lighting people and folks come in with just a basic two-camera shoot for a news program separate from this.
[3:39:26.020 --> 3:39:31.020]  But I looked at the books, even after the money bomb, and moving into this new office, we don't even have the money for that.
[3:39:31.020 --> 3:39:33.020]  So it comes down to that.
[3:39:33.020 --> 3:39:39.020]  So all those COINTELPRO that are so angry or people that are just jealous of the work we're doing to understand this is life and death.
[3:39:39.020 --> 3:39:43.020]  Go in there and let's bid Terany Crusher 1 up all the way.
[3:39:43.020 --> 3:39:49.020]  Let's get it done, ladies and gentlemen, because this is a fundraiser for free speech and what we're doing here.
[3:39:49.020 --> 3:39:51.020]  Let me, let's see how high it'll go.
[3:39:51.020 --> 3:39:53.020]  It closes out next Wednesday.
[3:39:53.020 --> 3:39:59.020]  And let's go ahead and play a clip from Scanner Darkly where you see Terany Crusher 1 and Alex Jones.
[3:39:59.020 --> 3:40:02.020]  When we post this video, people put links up saying, I'm making it up.
[3:40:02.020 --> 3:40:04.020]  I'm not even in Scanner Darkly or Waking Life.
[3:40:04.020 --> 3:40:07.020]  Folks, that's COINTELPRO on the site saying I wasn't in Scanner Darkly.
[3:40:07.020 --> 3:40:11.020]  I don't talk about it that much, so I guess they just can't believe it.
[3:40:11.020 --> 3:40:17.020]  Or that a film I'm in this year is the top selection at South by Southwest, but I'll leave that as a side issue.
[3:40:17.020 --> 3:40:22.020]  And coming up at, what's the one up in Utah, that big one, side issue.
[3:40:22.020 --> 3:40:25.020]  The point is we're having huge effects, and that's what we should.
[3:40:25.020 --> 3:40:26.020]  We should be ready for success.
[3:40:26.020 --> 3:40:27.020]  We should be ready for victory.
[3:40:27.020 --> 3:40:29.020]  Let's go ahead and play this clip from Scanner Darkly.
[3:40:58.020 --> 3:41:00.020]  Hey guys, I used to be one of you.
[3:41:00.020 --> 3:41:02.020]  Stop selling out your own species!
[3:41:12.020 --> 3:41:13.020]  Hey!
[3:41:14.020 --> 3:41:15.020]  Get in!
[3:41:17.020 --> 3:41:18.020]  Scared me.
[3:41:18.020 --> 3:41:20.020]  No, there's Keanu Reeves and one other writer.
[3:41:20.020 --> 3:41:22.020]  It was fun doing that scene with him.
[3:41:22.020 --> 3:41:24.020]  Okay, let's stop right there, okay?
[3:41:24.020 --> 3:41:27.020]  Let's cut back to this camera for a moment.
[3:41:27.020 --> 3:41:31.020]  Now, this is a piece of memorabilia, the only piece I've ever sold.
[3:41:31.020 --> 3:41:34.020]  My most used bullhorn, it's in that film.
[3:41:34.020 --> 3:41:38.020]  It got the line cut in Denver when they attacked its MSNBC employees.
[3:41:38.020 --> 3:41:41.020]  That's Tierney Crusher 1 up at eBayStoryInFullWars.com.
[3:41:41.020 --> 3:41:45.020]  Now here's a piece of memorabilia that I will never sell.
[3:41:45.020 --> 3:41:50.020]  I told you I had this, and I had people laugh at me and say I didn't.
[3:41:50.020 --> 3:41:52.020]  Charlie Sheen gave me this.
[3:41:52.020 --> 3:41:54.020]  And this is on the cover.
[3:41:54.020 --> 3:41:57.020]  In fact, bring me that video DVD cover please.
[3:41:57.020 --> 3:41:58.020]  He told me to share it with folks.
[3:41:58.020 --> 3:42:00.020]  He said, you know, what should I do with it?
[3:42:00.020 --> 3:42:02.020]  He said, oh, frame it in your house or show it to your friends, whatever,
[3:42:02.020 --> 3:42:04.020]  because you're the real Wolverine.
[3:42:04.020 --> 3:42:07.020]  And he was 14, I guess, when he did that movie, or 15.
[3:42:07.020 --> 3:42:10.020]  And this is the letter jackets they gave him all.
[3:42:10.020 --> 3:42:12.020]  In red dawn, you can see it on the cover.
[3:42:12.020 --> 3:42:14.020]  There's Charlie Sheen down in the corner.
[3:42:14.020 --> 3:42:17.020]  You can see the sea of the letter jacket in that.
[3:42:17.020 --> 3:42:21.020]  And this is the original Wolverine jacket he wore in the film.
[3:42:21.020 --> 3:42:23.020]  And then he wore it after that in high school.
[3:42:23.020 --> 3:42:25.020]  So it's torn up a bit.
[3:42:25.020 --> 3:42:27.020]  And I said, how in the world did you give me a piece of memorabilia?
[3:42:27.020 --> 3:42:28.020]  This is his first big movie.
[3:42:28.020 --> 3:42:30.020]  This is worth a lot of money.
[3:42:30.020 --> 3:42:32.020]  He said, don't worry about that, Alex.
[3:42:32.020 --> 3:42:34.020]  You know, this is because you're the real Wolverine.
[3:42:34.020 --> 3:42:36.020]  That's how cool Charlie is.
[3:42:36.020 --> 3:42:38.020]  Look at this.
[3:42:38.020 --> 3:42:40.020]  Isn't that cool?
[3:42:40.020 --> 3:42:43.020]  And I've been so busy, I've got to get around to framing it.
[3:42:43.020 --> 3:42:45.020]  You know, through a hard rock cafe or whatever in my house or something.
[3:42:45.020 --> 3:42:47.020]  But I mean, because I always love that movie.
[3:42:47.020 --> 3:42:50.020]  I remember I came down to visit my grandparents in Austin
[3:42:50.020 --> 3:42:51.020]  with my dad and mom.
[3:42:51.020 --> 3:42:53.020]  And my dad said, come on, let's go see a movie.
[3:42:53.020 --> 3:42:55.020]  Went and saw Red Dawn.
[3:42:55.020 --> 3:42:57.020]  And I was just totally blown away by it.
[3:42:57.020 --> 3:43:02.020]  And Charlie Sheen, just an amazing job acting in that film.
[3:43:02.020 --> 3:43:04.020]  But here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:43:04.020 --> 3:43:07.020]  I've got some other mementos that big stars have given me without me asking.
[3:43:07.020 --> 3:43:09.020]  I don't know why they give me stuff.
[3:43:09.020 --> 3:43:11.020]  Rick Linkletters giving me stuff and other people have that I won't talk about.
[3:43:11.020 --> 3:43:14.020]  But there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:43:14.020 --> 3:43:18.020]  And I thought I would show you this jacket from the film.
[3:43:18.020 --> 3:43:22.020]  In fact, let's cut to Jaren so people can see a wide shot of it.
[3:43:22.020 --> 3:43:28.020]  Let's get that camera aimed over there at Jaren so people can get a better view of it.
[3:43:28.020 --> 3:43:33.020]  And then after we do that, we are going to go ahead and go to a clip from Red Dawn
[3:43:33.020 --> 3:43:37.020]  where you see the jacket that's worn throughout the movie.
[3:43:37.020 --> 3:43:39.020]  There's quite a few scenes.
[3:43:39.020 --> 3:43:42.020]  Go ahead and flip it around for them, Jaren.
[3:43:42.020 --> 3:43:43.020]  I don't know.
[3:43:43.020 --> 3:43:45.020]  I mean, I forget I've got stuff like this.
[3:43:45.020 --> 3:43:46.020]  It's just so cool.
[3:43:46.020 --> 3:43:50.020]  I can't think of a cooler, peaceful movie, memorabilia.
[3:43:50.020 --> 3:43:53.020]  I guess Darth Vader's Lifesaver or something like that.
[3:43:53.020 --> 3:43:58.020]  Let's go ahead and go to the clip from Red Dawn that came out in the early 1980s or mid-1980s.
[3:43:58.020 --> 3:44:00.020]  Thanks for the ride.
[3:44:00.020 --> 3:44:01.020]  Okay.
[3:44:01.020 --> 3:44:02.020]  What's the deal?
[3:44:02.020 --> 3:44:03.020]  You're going.
[3:44:03.020 --> 3:44:04.020]  You don't have time for breakfast.
[3:44:04.020 --> 3:44:05.020]  Are you working or what?
[3:44:05.020 --> 3:44:08.020]  Yeah, I'll be at the station all day, so you're going to have to hit your ride home.
[3:44:08.020 --> 3:44:09.020]  All right.
[3:44:09.020 --> 3:44:10.020]  You got to practice today.
[3:44:10.020 --> 3:44:11.020]  After that, man.
[3:44:11.020 --> 3:44:12.020]  We're on double time.
[3:44:12.020 --> 3:44:13.020]  Triple.
[3:44:13.020 --> 3:44:14.020]  You should be ashamed of yourself.
[3:44:14.020 --> 3:44:15.020]  You think they take it down.
[3:44:15.020 --> 3:44:16.020]  All right.
[3:44:16.020 --> 3:44:17.020]  Come on, buddy.
[3:44:17.020 --> 3:44:19.020]  You lost football game once yourself.
[3:44:19.020 --> 3:44:20.020]  What?
[3:44:20.020 --> 3:44:21.020]  I don't remember.
[3:44:21.020 --> 3:44:23.020]  I do.
[3:44:23.020 --> 3:44:24.020]  I think you're lying.
[3:44:24.020 --> 3:44:25.020]  Yeah.
[3:44:25.020 --> 3:44:27.020]  I didn't even win to bleed your mouth.
[3:44:27.020 --> 3:44:32.020]  I like this.
[3:44:32.020 --> 3:44:33.020]  Later, buddy.
[3:44:33.020 --> 3:44:35.020]  See you, Jen.
[3:44:35.020 --> 3:44:36.020]  Such dear history.
[3:44:36.020 --> 3:44:37.020]  Yeah.
[3:44:37.020 --> 3:44:38.020]  Some of it.
[3:44:38.020 --> 3:44:44.020]  Now, the great hunt out in a semi-circle, I would say about the size of Rhode Island.
[3:44:44.020 --> 3:44:49.020]  Then they would ride forward, driving everything before them.
[3:44:49.020 --> 3:44:54.020]  Beasts, men, even bugs.
[3:44:54.020 --> 3:44:59.020]  Now, the ends would kind of close in to form a shrinking circle.
[3:44:59.020 --> 3:45:05.020]  That's what's happening in Israel right now, though.
[3:45:05.020 --> 3:45:08.020]  Same deal.
[3:45:08.020 --> 3:45:13.020]  Oh, he tackles even the jacket.
[3:45:13.020 --> 3:45:15.020]  Tackle the Rusky.
[3:45:15.020 --> 3:45:24.020]  By the way, I'm on Russia Today during election day coverage for a full hour.
[3:45:24.020 --> 3:45:33.020]  And, of course, Red Dawn is the favorite film of the malicious.
[3:45:33.020 --> 3:45:36.020]  And now I have the jacket.
[3:45:36.020 --> 3:45:38.020]  Wolverines!
[3:45:38.020 --> 3:45:41.020]  It's fine.
[3:45:41.020 --> 3:45:43.020]  I mean, we're in danger.
[3:45:43.020 --> 3:45:47.020]  A lot of us will get killed in this fight, but at least I get to meet cool people like Charlie Sheen.
[3:45:47.020 --> 3:45:51.020]  And there is handing the.357 to his brother, the evil Second Amendment.
[3:45:51.020 --> 3:45:53.020]  Look at those rifles in the car.
[3:45:53.020 --> 3:45:56.020]  They just absolutely hate the liberty.
[3:45:56.020 --> 3:45:58.020]  It's fun.
[3:45:58.020 --> 3:46:00.020]  It's fun, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:46:00.020 --> 3:46:04.020]  But that is a piece of memorabilia I will never sell unless, I guess, my children are starving.
[3:46:04.020 --> 3:46:06.020]  And at that point, there probably won't even be an eBay.
[3:46:06.020 --> 3:46:08.020]  Imagine how much that sucker would fetch.
[3:46:08.020 --> 3:46:12.020]  But again, that's just how classy Charlie Sheen is.
[3:46:12.020 --> 3:46:15.020]  And he gives his friends, people he really likes, things like that.
[3:46:15.020 --> 3:46:17.020]  And I'm just so honored to be involved in his life.
[3:46:17.020 --> 3:46:20.020]  That's why the system has tried to demonize him and attack him.
[3:46:20.020 --> 3:46:23.020]  And he was told shut up about 9-Eleven Truth that they destroy him.
[3:46:23.020 --> 3:46:25.020]  They tried to in the media, but it was unsuccessful.
[3:46:25.020 --> 3:46:26.020]  One more look.
[3:46:26.020 --> 3:46:27.020]  People will probably never see it again.
[3:46:27.020 --> 3:46:29.020]  There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:46:29.020 --> 3:46:33.020]  The famous jacket from the movie on the Red Dawn cover.
[3:46:33.020 --> 3:46:36.020]  The Wolverine jacket.
[3:46:36.020 --> 3:46:39.020]  That now I, Wolverine One, own.
[3:46:39.020 --> 3:46:41.020]  What a strange life, man.
[3:46:41.020 --> 3:46:43.020]  Fighting tyranny has had its rewards.
[3:46:43.020 --> 3:46:45.020]  It's also had its punishments.
[3:46:45.020 --> 3:46:50.020]  But at the same time, overall, it's good to be involved in liberty and freedom and fighting corruption.
[3:46:50.020 --> 3:46:55.020]  And I get to associate with all those that love freedom, love humanity, that have honor, that have courage.
[3:46:55.020 --> 3:47:01.020]  All of you that are into evil, you get to associate it with backbiting, backstabbing, lying, delusional abuse of scum,
[3:47:01.020 --> 3:47:03.020]  and the stench of death in New World Order.
[3:47:03.020 --> 3:47:06.020]  And I get to be around the heroes that care about freedom.
[3:47:06.020 --> 3:47:09.020]  And that's why I've got to step to the plate and be the best I can.
[3:47:09.020 --> 3:47:13.020]  And be the most honest and focused and most well researched I can.
[3:47:13.020 --> 3:47:16.020]  And that's why I work at least 18 hours a day in the fight against the New World Order.
[3:47:16.020 --> 3:47:18.020]  Because you only get one shot at this in life.
[3:47:18.020 --> 3:47:19.020]  And I want to be on the good team.
[3:47:19.020 --> 3:47:20.020]  And I want to be victorious.
[3:47:20.020 --> 3:47:22.020]  And all the glory goes to God.
[3:47:22.020 --> 3:47:23.020]  All right, folks.
[3:47:23.020 --> 3:47:29.020]  We'll be right back in the final segment of this amazing eighth day of January 2009.
[3:47:29.020 --> 3:47:33.020]  In FullWars.com and get the bullhorn at eBay.
[3:47:33.020 --> 3:47:35.020]  Terony Crusher won.
[3:47:35.020 --> 3:47:37.020]  Yeah!

[3:49:34.020 --> 3:50:03.020]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[3:50:34.020 --> 3:50:41.020]  Let's get inside today.
[3:50:41.020 --> 3:50:47.020]  Waging War on Corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:50:47.020 --> 3:50:49.020]  Wolverines baby.
[3:50:49.020 --> 3:50:54.020]  Yeah.
[3:50:54.020 --> 3:50:58.020]  You know, I'm not going to show you Charlie's note that came with it.
[3:50:58.020 --> 3:51:00.020]  That's private.
[3:51:00.020 --> 3:51:02.020]  But I'm done talking about that.
[3:51:02.020 --> 3:51:06.020]  What a rebroadcast that's coming up on the InfoWars.com Streams and we'll post this
[3:51:06.020 --> 3:51:10.100]  last two hours of video on the PrismPlanet.tv for members from the show ends in T minus
[3:51:10.100 --> 3:51:12.820]  four and a half minutes.
[3:51:12.820 --> 3:51:19.100]  But in closing, again, we're trying to fund this operation and the reason we're able
[3:51:19.100 --> 3:51:22.220]  to expand or maintain, I'm kind of wondering when are we going to expand or just maintain
[3:51:22.220 --> 3:51:26.020]  with the economy the way it is, we need more funds and I hope you will get the books and
[3:51:26.020 --> 3:51:29.820]  videos and materials and also support our sponsors and one of them is the place I buy
[3:51:29.820 --> 3:51:36.920]  precious metals and Ted has still got gold at 60, 70, some of the pieces $80 under the
[3:51:36.920 --> 3:51:42.940]  price it's selling for gold is up right now right at $15 today from yesterday.
[3:51:42.940 --> 3:51:46.100]  And you heard Dr. Paul Craig Roberts say we will have a depression worse.
[3:51:46.100 --> 3:51:47.100]  He never talked like that.
[3:51:47.100 --> 3:51:48.100]  The father of economics.
[3:51:48.100 --> 3:51:49.500]  So I wanted to bring Ted on.
[3:51:49.500 --> 3:51:50.500]  Ted Anderson here at the end.
[3:51:50.500 --> 3:51:51.700]  He hadn't been on in about a week.
[3:51:51.700 --> 3:51:54.580]  Ted, you've got the super deal for people.
[3:51:54.580 --> 3:51:55.580]  Tell folks about it.
[3:51:55.580 --> 3:51:56.580]  I did.
[3:51:56.580 --> 3:51:59.380]  I was able to even back down a little bit on the British Sovereigns and Franks right
[3:51:59.380 --> 3:52:00.380]  now.
[3:52:00.380 --> 3:52:05.860]  I've got the French Frank a 204 and the British sovereign a 252 so so so where is that price
[3:52:05.860 --> 3:52:06.860]  in the market?
[3:52:06.860 --> 3:52:07.860]  Like 7760.
[3:52:07.860 --> 3:52:12.060]  Yeah, comparatively speaking, I did a little check on it and I was looking to see where
[3:52:12.060 --> 3:52:17.020]  I'd be at if I was going to do it at today's current current spot prices and the Frank
[3:52:17.020 --> 3:52:22.980]  comes in closer to 214 and the British sovereign comes much closer to 270.
[3:52:22.980 --> 3:52:27.780]  And then and then I also have the buffaloes and again, I'll put 50 more out there.
[3:52:27.780 --> 3:52:31.580]  The bottom line on those is they're real hard to buy and I don't want to be selling something
[3:52:31.580 --> 3:52:33.820]  I can't deliver real quick.
[3:52:33.820 --> 3:52:38.420]  So the gold buffalo, we have those right now at 1036, which is actually the same price
[3:52:38.420 --> 3:52:40.300]  when gold was lower.
[3:52:40.300 --> 3:52:43.300]  I'm just, you know, I get them to trickle in here and I'm able to get a little bit of
[3:52:43.300 --> 3:52:44.940]  supply and I'll let 50 of the gold.
[3:52:44.940 --> 3:52:46.340]  So tell folks the coins you've got.
[3:52:46.340 --> 3:52:50.580]  You've got 50 buffaloes impossible to get in those places or huge premiums, no premium
[3:52:50.580 --> 3:52:51.580]  on it.
[3:52:51.580 --> 3:52:54.020]  50 of those, you've got a lot of sovereigns and Franks though.
[3:52:54.020 --> 3:52:55.020]  Yes, we do.
[3:52:55.020 --> 3:52:57.020]  That's the thing that I can get in your hands real fast.
[3:52:57.020 --> 3:52:58.620]  Not about the silver half dollars.
[3:52:58.620 --> 3:52:59.620]  Yeah.
[3:52:59.620 --> 3:53:00.620]  Definitely the silver half dollars.
[3:53:00.620 --> 3:53:01.620]  There's no question about it.
[3:53:01.620 --> 3:53:05.020]  They're at 840 or 168 per roll of 20.
[3:53:05.020 --> 3:53:08.980]  And the reason why they're such a good idea because if we do have a depression, you're
[3:53:08.980 --> 3:53:14.100]  going to have to buy things like groceries and to have a big old gold piece, maybe too
[3:53:14.100 --> 3:53:15.300]  much money.
[3:53:15.300 --> 3:53:18.980]  And so you get into the silver besides that silver is much tighter supply.
[3:53:18.980 --> 3:53:21.380]  These are gorgeous great coins.
[3:53:21.380 --> 3:53:22.540]  What's the price on those?
[3:53:22.540 --> 3:53:23.540]  They're currently right now.
[3:53:23.540 --> 3:53:28.300]  Again, they're at 168 per roll of 20 and Alice, you need to have silver.
[3:53:28.300 --> 3:53:29.300]  I mean, you really do.
[3:53:29.300 --> 3:53:30.300]  You need to have that.
[3:53:30.300 --> 3:53:31.300]  How much is that per unit?
[3:53:31.300 --> 3:53:32.300]  I down to $8.40.
[3:53:32.300 --> 3:53:38.740]  So that's an amazing deal with silver up as well, 800-686-2237.
[3:53:38.740 --> 3:53:40.740]  The brokers will be there until midnight tonight.
[3:53:40.740 --> 3:53:42.540]  And is that deal hold through till tomorrow, Ted?
[3:53:42.540 --> 3:53:43.540]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:53:43.540 --> 3:53:46.620]  We'll hold it through midnight tonight and if the market's still strong, we'll do it
[3:53:46.620 --> 3:53:47.620]  tomorrow too.
[3:53:47.620 --> 3:53:52.740]  800-686-2237 for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[3:53:52.740 --> 3:54:01.460]  It's on screen right now, 800-686-2237, like the old cartoons, Bouncing Ball, 800-686-2237.
[3:54:01.460 --> 3:54:03.620]  I mean, it is right there.
[3:54:03.620 --> 3:54:06.220]  And I want to know where to go, Ted.
[3:54:06.220 --> 3:54:09.140]  We have time at the very end of the show to go out with Ted's theme music and John will
[3:54:09.140 --> 3:54:10.820]  suspend his theme music.
[3:54:10.820 --> 3:54:13.100]  Yeah, get that right for the last 45 seconds.
[3:54:13.100 --> 3:54:15.020]  Ted, I want to commend you.
[3:54:15.020 --> 3:54:16.700]  People cannot beat those deals.
[3:54:16.700 --> 3:54:20.620]  That is a steal anywhere in the market and still most brokers can't get gold and silver.
[3:54:20.620 --> 3:54:23.020]  They're selling one coin at a time.
[3:54:23.020 --> 3:54:25.060]  You've been in this business 30 years.
[3:54:25.060 --> 3:54:26.780]  You're able to pass these savings along.
[3:54:26.780 --> 3:54:30.540]  Is that 70 or 80 dollars under what the market's selling these for?
[3:54:30.540 --> 3:54:34.540]  Well, I mean, because the gold is up another 10 bucks, I guess it's closer to 80.
[3:54:34.540 --> 3:54:37.180]  And you know, the other thing too, we're selling those creature books with a silver
[3:54:37.180 --> 3:54:39.560]  dollar way below cost.
[3:54:39.560 --> 3:54:44.020]  And that 25-dollar book with a 20-something dollar, silver dollar that are going for premiums
[3:54:44.020 --> 3:54:46.020]  with a six-dollar shipping for what?
[3:54:46.020 --> 3:54:47.020]  How much?
[3:54:47.020 --> 3:54:48.020]  26.45.
[3:54:48.020 --> 3:54:50.820]  So, that's 20-something bucks under what it cost you?
[3:54:50.820 --> 3:54:51.820]  Yeah, it is.
[3:54:51.820 --> 3:54:52.820]  It really is.
[3:54:52.820 --> 3:54:55.420]  And people are buying the books and keeping the silver dollars and passing them on to
[3:54:55.420 --> 3:54:56.420]  people.
[3:54:56.420 --> 3:54:58.140]  I can't think of a better way to spread the word on it.
[3:54:58.140 --> 3:55:03.940]  And Ted just does this for our audience, 800-686-2237.
[3:55:03.940 --> 3:55:04.940]  Hold on.
[3:55:04.940 --> 3:55:06.140]  That's my Starship Troopers music.
[3:55:06.140 --> 3:55:09.660]  John's got to cut that off with a gold there.
[3:55:09.660 --> 3:55:13.340]  I want to know with a gold there.
[3:55:13.340 --> 3:55:14.500]  I want to know.
[3:55:14.500 --> 3:55:15.660]  I want to know.
[3:55:15.660 --> 3:55:16.660]  I want to know.
[3:55:16.660 --> 3:55:17.660]  God bless you all.
[3:55:17.660 --> 3:55:18.660]  Thank you.
[3:55:18.660 --> 3:55:19.660]  Take care.
[3:55:19.660 --> 3:55:20.660]  Rebroadcast starts now.
[3:55:20.660 --> 3:55:47.660]  God bless you all.
