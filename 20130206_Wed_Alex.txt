[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:33.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.040 --> 00:43.320]  I have absolutely got to cover all this news I sat here in the last hour and of
[00:43.320 --> 00:47.480]  course last night and this morning reading over all of this news and I
[00:47.480 --> 00:52.640]  want to cover it all today I was on coast-to-coast AM last night with George
[00:52.640 --> 00:57.880]  Norring and after I was on with him I tuned in and kept listening for about an
[00:57.880 --> 01:03.920]  hour and just listening to him and others marvel marvel and I got a lot of
[01:03.920 --> 01:09.440]  phone calls last night from other talk show hosting people just saying I can't
[01:09.440 --> 01:12.800]  believe it's all coming true you said they would have armed drones in our
[01:12.800 --> 01:16.000]  skies and that they would say that the government is judge jury and
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.040]  executioner and will preemptively kill you even if you're not planning an
[01:20.040 --> 01:26.960]  imminent attack because if somebody's coming with a machine gun or a bomb and
[01:26.960 --> 01:30.920]  they've told a witness I'm gonna go blow something up the police can set up a
[01:30.920 --> 01:35.040]  checkpoint looking for that vehicle say stop the vehicle and if the person that
[01:35.040 --> 01:40.800]  matches this description doesn't stop then you can kill them because you've
[01:40.800 --> 01:45.080]  got probable cause you've got witnesses you know what they're planning that's
[01:45.080 --> 01:49.800]  not judge jury and executioner that's self-defense they take that argument and
[01:49.800 --> 01:54.840]  say we can just kill whoever we want without the evidence anything's being
[01:54.840 --> 02:01.520]  planned if the people are connected to a group connected to a group and you
[02:01.520 --> 02:05.760]  know so many times yesterday I got on there I spent five minutes in three
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.880]  hours yesterday covering the drone story and everybody else covered it all day
[02:10.880 --> 02:16.040]  long and I guess that's good it's just it's such old news for us people are
[02:16.040 --> 02:20.040]  finally freaking out hearing governors and mayors not just Jesse Jackson and
[02:20.040 --> 02:24.600]  members of Congress going you know we need armed troops regular army in the
[02:24.600 --> 02:32.000]  streets of st. Louis and Chicago and New York and and we TSA on the streets of
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.520]  every city armed with 9 millimeters or 40 cal strapped to their hips commando
[02:38.520 --> 02:42.600]  style and yeah we do need the army on the streets and people are going man you
[02:42.600 --> 02:47.520]  you said all this is coming now wow Alex Jones you weren't lying to us listen I
[02:47.520 --> 02:55.520]  don't want credit okay I want you to now listen to me and realize that I know
[02:55.520 --> 03:01.480]  the next phase of this program if we let them go there total engineered
[03:01.480 --> 03:05.800]  financial collapse they're gonna start a civil war calling anyone that resists
[03:05.800 --> 03:10.160]  tyranny a terrorist they're going to stage false flags to blame and frame us
[03:10.160 --> 03:14.520]  it's the oldest trick in the book the Nazis did it the Soviets did it the
[03:14.520 --> 03:18.200]  Zars did it before the Soviets the communists Chinese do it every
[03:18.200 --> 03:22.920]  authoritarian the ancient Romans would set a fire routinely and blame a
[03:22.920 --> 03:27.000]  political enemy inside Rome everywhere else they could just kill you but if
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.640]  you're a Roman citizen they had to set you up that's where this is going got
[03:30.640 --> 03:36.080]  news flash when they got over a hundred torture camps worldwide torture camps
[03:36.080 --> 03:39.480]  were the 35 countries that's now declassified this is all come out
[03:39.480 --> 03:45.560]  before well leaked and then they confirm it's real when they're doing stuff like
[03:45.560 --> 03:50.760]  that they're not the good guys okay and they want to flip the script off of the
[03:50.760 --> 03:54.560]  Muslim extremist as they call them on to the American people in general they're
[03:54.560 --> 03:57.680]  gonna flip the script well I guess they already flipped the script kept telling
[03:57.680 --> 04:00.960]  you for 10 12 years they're gonna flip the script now they're flipping the
[04:00.960 --> 04:05.560]  script where we're we're in between right now during the flipping of the
[04:05.560 --> 04:11.080]  script we're in that no man's land right now kind of like when you're
[04:11.080 --> 04:14.520]  driving through the you know the light turns green you pull out and you go oh
[04:14.520 --> 04:19.720]  I should have looked because you see that truck or that car going 60 miles an
[04:19.720 --> 04:24.040]  hour and you look and you try to slam on your brakes and they try to slam on
[04:24.040 --> 04:30.440]  their brakes but oh and and we're just I mean now now we're fighting to back
[04:30.440 --> 04:34.000]  this off and that's applying the brakes we're applying the brakes trying to
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.720]  people in government and corporations to apply the brakes and so the cars are
[04:37.720 --> 04:42.760]  whoo but you know they're gonna hit it's flipping right now scripts flipping
[04:42.760 --> 04:49.720]  right now and it's it's it's you think things are crazy right now you ain't

[08:06.200 --> 08:22.120]  gcn radio network
[08:22.120 --> 08:37.720]  it is wednesday my friends the sixth day of february 2013 i am your host alex
[08:37.720 --> 08:42.600]  jones and we're going to be live here for the next three hours paul watson
[08:42.600 --> 08:48.920]  joins us with an incredibly important science report special report at the
[08:48.920 --> 08:53.800]  bottom of the hour major scientific institutions have come out
[08:53.800 --> 08:58.200]  and they've cross-referenced each other's research and it appears that
[08:58.200 --> 09:05.720]  light waves and other matter is in some type of ordered format that appears to
[09:05.720 --> 09:09.480]  be coded coded and appears to be a
[09:09.480 --> 09:14.280]  simulation that's why so many top scientists who were atheist
[09:14.280 --> 09:19.400]  got into the 96 of the dna and we've done reports on this
[09:19.400 --> 09:23.320]  that they thought was junk and found all the coding in there
[09:23.320 --> 09:27.400]  and got religion very very quickly
[09:28.040 --> 09:32.680]  life did not come out of nothingness and then the atheists say well it must have
[09:32.680 --> 09:37.800]  been ceded here from deep space well where did that life come from and then
[09:37.800 --> 09:42.760]  where did that life come from what is the universe
[09:42.760 --> 09:47.240]  it is the thought of the creator it is the
[09:47.240 --> 09:50.520]  god thinks and it is created it is a simulation
[09:50.520 --> 09:54.920]  of the mind of god but we are creations with free will
[09:54.920 --> 10:00.520]  made in the image of god and imagine we are we are genetic expressions but
[10:00.520 --> 10:06.760]  endowed with a spirit by god who are able to then decipher the coding
[10:06.760 --> 10:10.760]  we've now gotten to that point where the scientists are saying there is no god
[10:10.760 --> 10:14.760]  and they're deciphering the coding and going this whole thing's a simulation
[10:14.760 --> 10:19.640]  this is designed this is coded what is this
[10:23.560 --> 10:26.440]  and i already knew that because i've read the bible
[10:26.440 --> 10:30.200]  i don't subscribe to what the Aztecs and the Mayan Mesoamerican culture said you
[10:30.200 --> 10:32.440]  know they they thought you had to sacrifice kids every
[10:32.440 --> 10:35.800]  day or the gods would wake up and the dream would stop but they said
[10:35.800 --> 10:42.680]  the universe creation is the gods dream
[10:42.680 --> 10:47.320]  and so did every other culture had basically the same view
[10:47.320 --> 10:50.520]  but different permutations of it and it's so
[10:50.520 --> 10:56.600]  powerful now a lot of mainline christian denominations and others get
[10:56.600 --> 10:58.440]  shaken by this because it doesn't fit into the little
[10:58.440 --> 11:02.040]  staid preacher on the government payroll up there giving them a limited view of
[11:02.040 --> 11:04.680]  the universe and distorting what's in the bible and
[11:04.680 --> 11:08.120]  distorting what's in other ancient texts
[11:08.120 --> 11:11.880]  but we we know what's going on paul watson's joining us just from a
[11:11.880 --> 11:16.840]  scientific perspective and we'll show those articles it's is the universe a
[11:16.840 --> 11:20.200]  computer simulation that's his video special report right now up at info
[11:20.200 --> 11:24.520]  wars.com he'll be joining us live and then under
[11:24.520 --> 11:28.200]  his special video report he goes over all the big scientific reports showing
[11:28.200 --> 11:32.280]  this and this is not the first and it's in wired it's in the new
[11:32.280 --> 11:36.280]  scientist it's in technology review uh it is
[11:36.280 --> 11:40.840]  all right there. Plato's allegory of the cave
[11:40.840 --> 11:45.480]  what what we are perceiving we gotta get david icon about this what we are
[11:45.480 --> 11:51.720]  perceiving is only a limited spectrum visual decoding and encoding
[11:51.720 --> 11:55.640]  of one spectrum of visible light which is one
[11:55.640 --> 11:58.920]  depending on the equation you look at
[11:58.920 --> 12:06.120]  basically incalculable uh google google plex
[12:06.120 --> 12:10.280]  of matter and and and then matter itself
[12:10.280 --> 12:14.840]  is only one three-dimensional system and our thought goes into the fourth and
[12:14.840 --> 12:17.720]  fifth dimension and this is what einstein knew
[12:17.720 --> 12:22.120]  it's what all the mathematicians find that there are very few top mathematicians
[12:22.120 --> 12:27.160]  you know guys with 170 180 iqs who don't grow up atheists from scientific
[12:27.160 --> 12:30.520]  families and then uh einstein said oh i believe in god
[12:30.520 --> 12:33.560]  god doesn't you know the universe isn't random
[12:33.560 --> 12:37.640]  now there's order to this god doesn't play dice in creation
[12:37.640 --> 12:41.400]  well let me tell you something this is designed and it's got level
[12:41.400 --> 12:47.960]  after level after level after level after level to it
[12:47.960 --> 12:50.680]  now i'm going to run through news here i've got to do it i've got a blitz through
[12:50.680 --> 12:54.520]  news and then paul watson's joining us then jennifer stall she's the
[12:54.520 --> 12:58.200]  mother they were their child not wanting a smart meter put on her property
[12:58.200 --> 13:01.640]  without a warrant or court order she's in was in court
[13:01.640 --> 13:05.400]  trying to block it that's why they came after so she has her legal lawful
[13:05.400 --> 13:09.560]  process and they come after her and they arrested her neighbor that videotaped
[13:09.560 --> 13:13.720]  it turns out what one other woman and said it's wiretapping to put us on
[13:13.720 --> 13:17.000]  youtube when the police are in public and there's no perception of privacy
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.840]  and every court ruling federal state common law common sense says that that's
[13:20.840 --> 13:23.960]  how they've got cameras watching us in public and now the cops have a
[13:23.960 --> 13:27.000]  microphone on or a camera on their glasses
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.120]  i mean it's just crazy it's absolutely crazy that i've been all over the
[13:32.120 --> 13:34.360]  country at demonstrations and things i'm covering
[13:34.360 --> 13:38.120]  and the police walk over with the camera mounted to their to their helmet or to
[13:38.120 --> 13:40.760]  their glasses and they're videotaping and audio taping i don't go
[13:40.760 --> 13:44.200]  oh call the police you're going to jail here let's put handcuffs on you
[13:44.200 --> 13:47.960]  they know and it's been thrown on a court thousands of times
[13:47.960 --> 13:51.720]  there's more than 14 states every week arresting people that i see about in the
[13:51.720 --> 13:55.240]  news so it's much be much more just just arresting arresting people for
[13:55.240 --> 13:59.000]  filming them in public i mean i've seen them arrest restaurants
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.800]  that have cameras in their own audio when the police come in and do something
[14:01.800 --> 14:05.400]  they don't want seen they come arrest the restaurant owner it's your property
[14:05.400 --> 14:09.160]  your cameras your microphones for your protection
[14:09.160 --> 14:12.600]  and they come and get you i mean i've got a report here
[14:12.600 --> 14:16.760]  now where they're now arresting kids for drawing guns and arresting kids
[14:16.760 --> 14:21.160]  for having a toy squirt gun and then the police are charging them with
[14:21.160 --> 14:26.360]  brandishing a weapon now the code in the state and the federal
[14:26.360 --> 14:29.960]  level says a weapon that can you has to hurt you and it describes what the
[14:29.960 --> 14:33.640]  weapons are projectile weapons what are those firearms
[14:33.640 --> 14:37.240]  the different types of firearms bows and arrows
[14:37.240 --> 14:42.440]  bolt guns gas guns not in there
[14:42.520 --> 14:45.320]  but you see the family won't know their lawyer will know and bring them in and
[14:45.320 --> 14:47.960]  get them a plea bargain get probably ten thousand dollars
[14:47.960 --> 14:51.960]  the ten-year-olds gone to jail didn't even threaten people
[14:51.960 --> 14:56.520]  said hey look at my little water gun your life's over bro
[14:56.520 --> 14:59.320]  you're going to be in juvenile hall you're going to learn how to deal drugs
[14:59.320 --> 15:03.080]  you're going to learn how to do runs run stuff for the big banks
[15:03.080 --> 15:07.800]  you're going to learn how to act tough and you but not be tough
[15:07.800 --> 15:12.840]  and this is the system this is the soviet style mind control just pouring in
[15:12.840 --> 15:15.480]  so she's going to be joining us the others lawyers have told them don't come
[15:15.480 --> 15:19.000]  on so they're all scared so that i guess they can be
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.360]  marched up where it's been thrown a court over and over again they should be
[15:22.360 --> 15:27.240]  filing civil rights violation lawsuits they're on the sidewalk
[15:27.240 --> 15:30.200]  videotaping police get climb over their fence
[15:30.200 --> 15:32.920]  with the utility people to put the smart meter on
[15:32.920 --> 15:37.720]  and they are even polite to the police and the police come back two days later
[15:37.720 --> 15:41.400]  when it's on youtube and arrest them all
[15:41.400 --> 15:45.960]  and you see them you know the attractive nice you know
[15:45.960 --> 15:50.120]  neighborhood attractive nice lady with her child you know sitting on her hip
[15:50.120 --> 15:55.000]  this is what police do in illinois they come and arrest
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.080]  the state attorney general last year wrote a paper and tried to support one

[33:02.760 --> 33:06.280]  crashing through the lies and disinformation
[33:06.280 --> 33:22.200]  it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[33:24.520 --> 33:31.880]  more top scientist and research firms universities have done huge computer
[33:31.880 --> 33:36.200]  breakdowns on cosmic rays light rays you name it and are finding this change
[33:36.200 --> 33:41.720]  signature of encoding or that it is a simulation
[33:41.720 --> 33:45.240]  the dna has it in there they found out it's not 96
[33:45.240 --> 33:50.040]  junk it is an incredible crystalline antenna system
[33:50.040 --> 33:57.800]  with dna sequences of all sorts of other life forms in it and that's why
[33:57.800 --> 34:02.200]  so many people that are atheist and and and and and and what does atheist means
[34:02.200 --> 34:06.200]  it just means you're closed-minded and you're sick of you know seeing fake
[34:06.200 --> 34:09.720]  preachers up there with limited spectrums or fake religions trying to
[34:09.720 --> 34:14.200]  interpret the true spirituality of the universe which just means we are aware
[34:14.200 --> 34:18.200]  of things being much larger and then we don't have all the answers
[34:18.200 --> 34:21.720]  and then some bible thumping christians will say what you're not subscribing to
[34:21.720 --> 34:25.640]  some southern baptist interpretation i'm a radio talk show host who happens to
[34:25.640 --> 34:29.400]  have a relationship with god through jesus christ
[34:29.400 --> 34:33.560]  but the issue here is if you didn't beat people over the head they would become
[34:33.560 --> 34:36.760]  spiritual which is the first step in awakening
[34:36.760 --> 34:41.080]  one of the quickest ways to awaken you can wake people up politically
[34:41.080 --> 34:45.240]  and then they tend to wake up spiritually and and that's really my
[34:45.240 --> 34:48.040]  goal i didn't do that on purpose but now i'm
[34:48.040 --> 34:51.560]  a little bit more wise than i used to be and understand
[34:51.560 --> 34:58.760]  uh why god has used me as a tool but all of us all of us have free will
[34:58.760 --> 35:01.880]  and so we're going to be talking to paul watson about these amazing reports
[35:01.880 --> 35:05.560]  here in just a moment he has a boil down up at info wars
[35:05.560 --> 35:11.800]  dot com and prison planet dot com where he's got links to mit and the scientific
[35:11.800 --> 35:15.480]  journals is the universe a computer simulation
[35:15.480 --> 35:19.960]  cosmic rays offer clue our universe could be a computer simulation and more
[35:19.960 --> 35:23.240]  we're going to be looking at all that first off here i already plugged two of
[35:23.240 --> 35:25.880]  these yesterday but these are the new affiliates we've gotten the last week and
[35:25.880 --> 35:31.480]  a half uh w h s y 950 a m hattiesburg mississippi
[35:31.480 --> 35:36.520]  w s d r 12 40 a m sterling illinois again that's w s

[36:03.960 --> 36:07.720]  salisbury north carolina
[36:08.440 --> 36:13.000]  and again they're adding all those up at gcm live dot com the affiliates list
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.880]  but i've gone and looked at and isn't even it didn't even like have our local
[36:15.880 --> 36:20.440]  f m a 99.7 a lot of other stuff on there but
[36:20.440 --> 36:23.640]  we're we're compiling it and then again genesis has always been a mom and pop
[36:23.640 --> 36:27.720]  operation now it's arguably the third or fourth largest
[36:27.720 --> 36:31.960]  syndicator in the country i talked to ted last week got the actual numbers
[36:31.960 --> 36:37.320]  get guess how many affiliates genesis s 13 plus 100
[36:37.320 --> 36:44.360]  1300 radio stations 1300 different ones 1300 that is
[36:44.360 --> 36:48.680]  big big and what a launch pad for us and we've
[36:48.680 --> 36:52.120]  been here since genesis started we've grown together
[36:52.120 --> 36:55.720]  and now the show is getting two three new affiliates a week and just
[36:55.720 --> 36:59.000]  i am so thankful because if i'm going to get killed doing this
[36:59.000 --> 37:04.680]  my god what might as well go 110 percent huh
[37:04.680 --> 37:10.200]  oh man i love the nature reality i love being awake i love being real i love
[37:10.200 --> 37:16.120]  stepping across that line i love it i love it i love
[37:16.120 --> 37:20.920]  consciousness i just thank god for consciousness i just thank god for
[37:20.920 --> 37:26.520]  for just being part of this magnificent creation that you have created
[37:26.520 --> 37:30.920]  i can just feel the universe absolutely flowing right through me
[37:30.920 --> 37:37.400]  the living waters oh it's awesome how could anybody be bored
[37:37.400 --> 37:41.480]  how could anybody not be just absolutely bouncing off the walls
[37:41.480 --> 37:46.360]  with how incredible this is and the animating contest of liberty
[37:46.360 --> 37:52.040]  my test your test on the game grid right now against evil
[37:52.040 --> 37:56.200]  what are you gonna do
[37:56.760 --> 38:01.320]  i'm not worried about he who can kill the body but he who kills the soul
[38:01.320 --> 38:05.240]  the soul is as real as the sun in the sky
[38:05.240 --> 38:09.720]  and it's light that you can't see except when it hits your cheek
[38:09.720 --> 38:14.280]  but when there's dust in the air for a moment you see the magic of the light
[38:14.280 --> 38:17.720]  your eye couldn't pick it up but you could see it with in the dust in the air
[38:17.720 --> 38:20.920]  or when it hit the waves in the water or went through the water in the air and
[38:20.920 --> 38:23.880]  made that rainbow
[38:26.760 --> 38:31.800]  all right i'm sorry i'm sure thinking about the universe that just happens

[42:04.600 --> 42:07.640]  and then say oh it must be true it must be real
[42:07.640 --> 42:11.960]  i have read the writings of top mathematicians people like einstein
[42:11.960 --> 42:15.320]  you've seen the reports i'm going to do one coming up next week showing all the
[42:15.320 --> 42:19.880]  bio engineers genetic engineers mathematicians who were
[42:19.880 --> 42:27.320]  atheists or agnostics but now with the incredible super
[42:27.320 --> 42:30.920]  electron microscopes and the cyclotrons and the
[42:30.920 --> 42:35.320]  and the super crunching computers they are seeing the coding
[42:35.320 --> 42:41.000]  in everything and how fantastic it is uh and are just saying this was made this
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.520]  was designed okay and that's a good starting
[42:44.520 --> 42:48.120]  point for people i've noticed atheists and i'm not
[42:48.120 --> 42:51.000]  attacking atheists out there but most of them are like
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.960]  i've had atheists before i've run into the folks through the local atheist tv
[42:53.960 --> 42:57.480]  show and i've been on the tv station uh and they're like oh you believe there's
[42:57.480 --> 43:01.080]  some new world order in black helicopters and at the tv station
[43:01.080 --> 43:04.200]  there was actually hanging on the bulletin board when that happened an
[43:04.200 --> 43:07.800]  article about a military drill and i said it's funny you said that
[43:07.800 --> 43:09.640]  they were probably saying because they were jealous because that was in the
[43:09.640 --> 43:13.000]  newspaper i go look they admit drills right here that i was right
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.160]  they went oh yeah sure this is a religion to you so see
[43:17.160 --> 43:20.840]  people that question we're a conspiracy theorist we question known liars
[43:20.840 --> 43:25.640]  certified liars that's weird we say look at the fantasticness of the universe i
[43:25.640 --> 43:29.800]  resonate i i have insight i i know when somebody's looking at me
[43:29.800 --> 43:35.640]  you know from behind i i i have you know pre cognitive powers we all do to
[43:35.640 --> 43:39.720]  some extent or another i mean i know there's something going on here and
[43:39.720 --> 43:44.200]  the scientist keeps proving it with the cells in plants and in animals and
[43:44.200 --> 43:47.720]  butterflies and fish where they are picking up electromagnetic
[43:47.720 --> 43:52.280]  feedback and light from the sun and uh they've they've excised these sensors
[43:52.280 --> 43:56.840]  they're also in the human brain and also in the stomach and and uh exposed them
[43:56.840 --> 43:59.880]  to radiation from space and they're resonating with it i mean we are just
[43:59.880 --> 44:04.120]  filled with receivers i mean we are incredible creatures and
[44:04.120 --> 44:08.520]  it's all science it's not quacky kookiness
[44:08.520 --> 44:14.360]  and they don't want you knowing that they don't want you getting sunshine they
[44:14.360 --> 44:17.560]  want you inside in the tv with its fake light
[44:17.560 --> 44:21.160]  programming your eyes that they know the sunlight goes right into your eyes and
[44:21.160 --> 44:24.600]  activates the pineal gland other areas of your brain they know all this now i'm
[44:24.600 --> 44:27.400]  going to go to paul watson for the balance of the hour he got shot a great
[44:27.400 --> 44:30.280]  video report with a bunch of news articles linked under it
[44:30.280 --> 44:34.760]  is the universe a computer simulation up at prisonplanet.com right now
[44:34.760 --> 44:39.960]  cosmic rays offer clue our universe could be a computer simulation
[44:39.960 --> 44:44.680]  and that's a wired magazine uh mit the idea we live in a
[44:44.680 --> 44:49.480]  simulation isn't science fiction mit technology review the measurement
[44:49.480 --> 44:52.840]  that would reveal the universe is a computer simulation
[44:52.840 --> 44:57.320]  and then it goes down to as they look at its freaking amount because it appears
[44:57.320 --> 45:00.360]  to be a simulation not random as they've claimed
[45:00.360 --> 45:03.960]  now again every field keeps finding this paul watson
[45:03.960 --> 45:08.600]  joining us from our london bureau over at prisonplanet.com
[45:08.600 --> 45:12.200]  as follow a video report on this paul watson break it down
[45:12.200 --> 45:15.720]  i looks good to be here yeah it's funny you were just mentioning
[45:15.720 --> 45:20.200]  you know skeptics saying cutting us up even for talking about this there was a
[45:20.200 --> 45:24.840]  comment info wars is jumping the shark by covering this
[45:24.840 --> 45:29.640]  and not only is it being discussed and it has been discussed for years by
[45:29.640 --> 45:33.960]  you know cutting-edge science you just mentioned mit wired magazine
[45:33.960 --> 45:38.360]  new scientist i mean plato was talking about it what nearly
[45:38.360 --> 45:43.000]  2500 years ago with the allegory of the cave which you've played on the show
[45:43.000 --> 45:46.200]  before you know rene daycar was talking about it
[45:46.200 --> 45:50.840]  400 years ago with his evil demon philosophy this whole idea that an
[45:50.840 --> 45:56.120]  illusion is created to distract us to divert us from reality
[45:56.120 --> 46:00.040]  so it's far from jumping the shark it's basically what everybody's talking
[46:00.040 --> 46:04.600]  about on the cutting edge of science now and the video i made about it
[46:04.600 --> 46:10.360]  was just a collation of articles about a university of bon experiment in
[46:10.360 --> 46:15.000]  germany undertaken by scientists who basically
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.560]  discovered through a calculation in which they use one tiny part of the
[46:19.560 --> 46:23.960]  universe that when cosmic rays fly through this part of the
[46:23.960 --> 46:27.640]  universe and dissipate they don't do so randomly
[46:27.640 --> 46:32.680]  they do so with an energy that's quo consistent with the kind of
[46:32.680 --> 46:36.280]  boundary that you'd find if there was an underlying lattice
[46:36.280 --> 46:41.400]  governing the limits of a simulator so basically they're saying that the
[46:41.400 --> 46:45.240]  movement and behavior of cosmic rays suggests that they're
[46:45.240 --> 46:48.920]  performing exactly as you would expect them to perform
[46:48.920 --> 46:53.240]  if they were trapped inside a giant computer simulation
[46:53.240 --> 46:58.280]  which we call the universe and it's based they based it the foundation of it
[46:58.280 --> 47:00.920]  on morse law which of course dictates that
[47:00.920 --> 47:04.280]  approximately every two years computer power doubles so
[47:04.280 --> 47:07.800]  eventually humanity is going to get to the stage where
[47:07.800 --> 47:12.360]  computers are so powerful that they can artificially create a reality which is
[47:12.360 --> 47:16.920]  virtually indistinguishable from what we call reality now
[47:16.920 --> 47:22.200]  um which begs the question of course how do we know that we're not already
[47:22.200 --> 47:28.360]  living inside a computer simulation and the reaction to this video so far
[47:28.360 --> 47:32.760]  from several people is well if we are living inside a computer
[47:32.760 --> 47:35.560]  simulation if we are living inside a matrix
[47:35.560 --> 47:39.720]  then what's the point life is pointless we're just a play thing a science
[47:39.720 --> 47:42.920]  project for either some future race or whatever but
[47:42.920 --> 47:47.000]  you know i look at it the opposite way if that is proven which science is
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  increasingly showing that it is the case that we're probably living inside an
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.800]  artificial created universe then that is proof of a creator isn't it
[47:55.800 --> 47:59.800]  well the universe was void and then god spoke it thought it and it
[47:59.800 --> 48:03.800]  and it was made and and and that's what they find in every discipline now
[48:03.800 --> 48:07.320]  is that it's designed and and the human word computer
[48:07.320 --> 48:12.440]  isn't even proper in all of this there is a governing structure they can see
[48:12.440 --> 48:17.320]  the modulation and off of the projection of the time space continuum
[48:17.320 --> 48:20.840]  off of just one of the reading these cosmic rays they continue
[48:20.840 --> 48:25.880]  to see particles that should be flowing at different rates and modulations
[48:25.880 --> 48:30.040]  with an overall modulation and they can tune it and begin to see the structure
[48:30.040 --> 48:35.400]  of the containment system and it's contained within the thought process
[48:35.400 --> 48:41.080]  of the creator of god of the great architect as the illuminati calls it
[48:41.080 --> 48:43.960]  but that's actually a biblical term which they've stolen
[48:43.960 --> 48:47.560]  and so it is it is the construction and what does the creator tell us
[48:47.560 --> 48:53.320]  you are made in my image you are creators as well but small creators
[48:53.320 --> 48:58.120]  and so it is the literally the consciousness and the will of god
[48:58.120 --> 49:02.120]  creating all of this but then giving us free will
[49:02.120 --> 49:08.680]  which is then flowing forth a whole new level of creation
[49:08.680 --> 49:12.920]  well precisely and i mean the way they explained it was
[49:12.920 --> 49:16.440]  think of a chess board you can only move a chess piece
[49:16.440 --> 49:21.720]  a minimum of one move one square on the board these cosmic rays when they
[49:21.720 --> 49:26.520]  modulate them against this lattice structure only move uniformly along
[49:26.520 --> 49:30.200]  this lattice structure they're not random so that's why they're saying that it
[49:30.200 --> 49:33.240]  shows that it's probably a computer-generated
[49:33.240 --> 49:37.720]  simulation and i mean you know if we if we think about it every
[49:37.720 --> 49:41.880]  night we create our own mini simulation in our
[49:41.880 --> 49:45.640]  dreams we can move around an environment we can interact with people and
[49:45.640 --> 49:48.840]  objects which is a fourth and fifth dimension projection
[49:48.840 --> 49:52.920]  which a mini equation show is actually affecting the universe
[49:52.920 --> 49:59.720]  at some type of galactic level yeah so if one human brain can do that then
[49:59.720 --> 50:03.960]  imagine what a supercomputer or a creator call it what you will
[50:03.960 --> 50:08.120]  with trillions of times the power of one human brain imagine what they could
[50:08.120 --> 50:11.400]  create with that kind of power well the way my dad described it is like a
[50:11.400 --> 50:16.040]  dragonfly's eye and that humans are literally like the
[50:16.040 --> 50:20.280]  compound eyes of a dragonfly through which god is
[50:20.280 --> 50:25.800]  looking imagine that and then it's a manifestation
[50:25.800 --> 50:29.880]  well yeah because every every sense that goes through the human brain is
[50:29.880 --> 50:34.040]  processed isn't it it's an electrical impulse which goes back to the whole
[50:34.040 --> 50:38.280]  brain in a vat theory you know since our brain is merely this decoder of
[50:38.280 --> 50:42.040]  electrical signals how do we know we're not a brain in a vat
[50:42.040 --> 50:45.640]  how do we know anything really when we are a brain in a vat
[50:45.640 --> 50:52.040]  inside this electrochemical uh body suit earth suit combat suit i mean that's
[50:52.040 --> 50:56.520]  it this is for the our consciousness our spirit to have this experience on this
[50:56.520 --> 51:01.240]  plane and that's why i don't fear death i mean i feel god i know attention
[51:01.240 --> 51:05.160]  guarders and patriots drought conditions in our nation's heartland and massive
[51:05.160 --> 51:08.840]  federal reserve debt monetizing are creating the perfect conditions for
[51:08.840 --> 51:13.080]  dramatically higher food prices in the months ahead that means there has never

[53:58.280 --> 54:09.960]  again ladies and gentlemen the system wants to keep your mind down here on
[54:09.960 --> 54:16.760]  earth we are in the world but not of it they want to keep you artificially
[54:16.760 --> 54:21.800]  focused on ugly things twisted things we have to cover their crimes but not
[54:21.800 --> 54:24.440]  because we want to keep you focused on ugliness so that you know they're the
[54:24.440 --> 54:28.600]  authors of ugliness and pain and suffering
[54:28.600 --> 54:32.440]  the creator of the universe is the author of exultation and enlightenment
[54:32.440 --> 54:36.920]  and life and gifts and bounty and honor and everything good
[54:36.920 --> 54:41.960]  and just wants to give it all to us everything just flowing endless
[54:41.960 --> 54:48.440]  endless gifts and the enemy the virus in the system wants to pull us down
[54:48.440 --> 54:52.440]  wants torture imagine our government's torture is good secret arrest yeah we
[54:52.440 --> 54:55.160]  torture people's kids the public's like that's terrible
[54:55.160 --> 54:58.760]  okay we'll stop doing that they should all go to jail
[54:58.760 --> 55:02.920]  they're all a bunch of perverts they're all a bunch of sickos
[55:02.920 --> 55:07.640]  and again it's not the judgment no one's perfect it's that they're willfully
[55:07.640 --> 55:13.800]  love the darkness it's beautiful to them okay and and beauty is ugly to them
[55:13.800 --> 55:17.320]  and it's it's not just this not this is that you know there's these big computer
[55:17.320 --> 55:20.040]  models it's not just them it's mit others have found this
[55:20.040 --> 55:23.480]  and a lot of the people are becoming religious and they're realizing it's a
[55:23.480 --> 55:26.600]  guild meant to control them just like modern churches and
[55:26.600 --> 55:29.560]  mainline religion is meant to control you and suppress you
[55:29.560 --> 55:33.720]  so is the whole atheists and agnostic movement they teach it's scientific and
[55:33.720 --> 55:38.040]  it's avant-garde to say there is no god the fool has said in his heart there is
[55:38.040 --> 55:42.440]  no god the evidence of god is written in the
[55:42.440 --> 55:46.360]  heavens it's written in the plants it's written in your children
[55:46.360 --> 55:50.520]  it's written in your eyes and the system
[55:50.520 --> 55:54.920]  knows this and wants to be god itself you understand that
[55:54.920 --> 55:58.600]  it is a false creation an abomination but it can't create
[55:58.600 --> 56:04.200]  it has to take god's creations and twist it but everything it does turns into a
[56:04.200 --> 56:06.760]  curse i don't mean to be preaching i apologize
[56:06.760 --> 56:09.880]  i don't really apologize but i got all this news to cover we got all that
[56:09.880 --> 56:12.360]  coming up in the next hour but paul watson finished up in the last three
[56:12.360 --> 56:16.440]  minutes my friend yeah another interesting thing is that they've
[56:16.440 --> 56:20.120]  found these error correcting codes which are
[56:20.120 --> 56:24.520]  similar to the ones in computers they've basically found them to be inherent
[56:24.520 --> 56:28.040]  in the very nature of reality in the universe itself
[56:28.040 --> 56:34.360]  so again that directly suggests intelligent design and it all phases in
[56:34.360 --> 56:38.520]  with this new study at the university of bond so basically
[56:38.520 --> 56:42.280]  they found that the cosmic rays the way they behave the way they move the
[56:42.280 --> 56:47.320]  way the energy dissipates is fits in with the notion that
[56:47.320 --> 56:51.960]  it is a computer generated simulation that there's lattice structures under
[56:51.960 --> 56:55.960]  underpinning it which inherently show intelligent design
[56:55.960 --> 57:00.200]  so it's not to say that we're all pointless our lives are pointless we're
[57:00.200 --> 57:04.760]  just an imagination of somebody else's science project
[57:04.760 --> 57:09.400]  the universe is littered with evidence that it has intelligent design and it's
[57:09.400 --> 57:12.200]  just so exciting to get into this kind of
[57:12.200 --> 57:16.360]  topic which is why i think you're going to start digging into it even more and
[57:16.360 --> 57:19.480]  there are several major scientists now coming out
[57:19.480 --> 57:24.280]  with this evidence one of them is nick bostrom at oxford university
[57:24.280 --> 57:28.520]  so it's just it's an exciting cutting-edge field of science and
[57:28.520 --> 57:32.040]  that's why i find it interesting
[57:33.240 --> 57:37.080]  alright paul so bottom line this needs to be investigated more and i think we
[57:37.080 --> 57:39.960]  should do special reports showing all the other scientists
[57:39.960 --> 57:43.000]  that are now discovering this many of them again who were atheist
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.200]  and they're not saying hey i believe in you know the baptist church or the
[57:46.200 --> 57:50.200]  catholic church or the muslims now they're saying this is designed
[57:50.200 --> 57:53.720]  and this is fractal design and i mean it's all right there
[57:53.720 --> 57:56.680]  and people need to understand folks that you know what you're seeing and what's
[57:56.680 --> 57:59.480]  on this planet this isn't everything people
[57:59.480 --> 58:03.080]  300 years ago would have thought what we have today would have been magic and
[58:03.080 --> 58:06.760]  would have thought we were gods now again i'm saying there is a god i'm
[58:06.760 --> 58:09.320]  not saying we're going to become gods i'm not saying
[58:09.320 --> 58:14.120]  it's a perspective of gods i'm saying that yeah no the creator made the entire
[58:14.120 --> 58:18.280]  universe that's god and we're able to decode just
[58:18.280 --> 58:21.640]  parts of it because we are given a spark of that
[58:21.640 --> 58:26.200]  anything else paul no i'll say alex all right great job my friend
[58:26.200 --> 58:30.360]  your reports up at prisonplanet.com is the universal computer simulation and
[58:30.360 --> 58:33.400]  the top scientists and huge computer programs are saying yes
[58:33.400 --> 58:36.120]  they can literally see the fingerprints they can see the plumbing
[58:36.120 --> 58:43.160]  they can see the magnetic field contained
[58:43.160 --> 58:51.160]  this is GCN the genesis communications radio network
[58:51.160 --> 58:53.800]  now that we have moved into the winter season
[58:53.800 --> 58:57.880]  there is an increased need to support our immunity and health
[58:57.880 --> 59:01.000]  at silver lungs we are committed to meeting your needs
[59:01.000 --> 59:04.600]  by providing a full selection of silver based products
[59:04.600 --> 59:09.720]  our most popular silver based products are the 32 ounce nano silver solutions
[59:09.720 --> 59:14.040]  our two ounce nano silver nasal applicators as well as our all natural
[59:14.040 --> 59:18.280]  silver soaps just released is our 100 percent natural
[59:18.280 --> 59:21.880]  silver gel our new silver gel is not based on
[59:21.880 --> 59:25.640]  synthetic gelling agents which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the

[1:00:40.040 --> 1:00:43.080]  joining us via video skype on the syndicated radio transmission in the
[1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:46.200]  next segment i had a very profound discussion just
[1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:50.120]  now with paul joseph watson and if you don't get excited about the nature of
[1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:52.920]  consciousness and the nature of the fact that you are an
[1:00:52.920 --> 1:00:57.240]  eternal being with a spirit deciding what dimension you're
[1:00:57.240 --> 1:01:01.480]  going to reside in that with all that is negative and
[1:01:01.480 --> 1:01:06.280]  destructive or with the with with a creator if that
[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:10.600]  doesn't excite you and just get your soul resonating
[1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:16.920]  then i really feel sorry for you it's all i can see because with awareness of
[1:01:16.920 --> 1:01:21.080]  this knowledge the universe opens up
[1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:28.440]  well the keys it's really solomon's keys
[1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:33.720]  all right my friends where do we begin here
[1:01:33.720 --> 1:01:36.600]  i've already gone over the out-of-control police state information
[1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:39.560]  when i get more into that the the news of torture bases everywhere
[1:01:39.560 --> 1:01:42.920]  continuing of course the warrantless wiretapping they'll kill you with drones
[1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:46.360]  of america they want no judge no jury no proof you're even a terrorist we'll
[1:01:46.360 --> 1:01:51.560]  just tell you if we want just better i mean just over the top
[1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:55.320]  just over the top absolute convicted themselves total criminals
[1:01:55.320 --> 1:01:58.200]  and the media is like well i guess it's a good killer if you want
[1:01:58.200 --> 1:02:02.200]  yeah torture's kind of good you know it's liberal it's got a peace prize do you
[1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:05.960]  got a peace prize hey looks like michelle obama's
[1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:10.200]  getting away racist yeah i think torturing uh
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:13.240]  you know kids all the world in front of their parents is pretty bad oh that's
[1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:18.280]  racist i want to turn my gun in i guess racist
[1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:24.920]  uh so that's all coming up so ridiculous the propaganda
[1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:28.520]  that they've got aimed at the public is designed for people with IQs with about
[1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:31.880]  80 points but even their higher grade propaganda they
[1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:36.120]  put out to the intelligentsia is for people with about 85 IQ
[1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:40.840]  i mean it's like all in slow motion and but you realize people that aren't
[1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:44.440]  captured by it aren't even really stupid it is ignorance it's more than
[1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:47.640]  interesting it's a trance it's like somebody brought up in a barn
[1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:51.000]  from birth who never was even told there was an outside world never heard
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:54.200]  sounds never was brought outside it's the allegory of the cave
[1:02:54.200 --> 1:02:58.280]  like you know growing up in a 2000 square foot metal box under the ground
[1:02:58.280 --> 1:03:01.480]  and foods just delivered down to you and a television set talks to you
[1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:04.680]  would that be a good allegory of the cave film to shoot
[1:03:04.680 --> 1:03:07.560]  i bet who did that might be the winner of the hundred thousand bucks
[1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:10.040]  status have millions of these ideas we should redo
[1:03:10.040 --> 1:03:14.680]  the the uh plateaus allegory of the cave and just show someone growing up
[1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:19.240]  with with a television and maybe a robot in a system like this is the universe

[1:03:22.120 --> 1:03:27.560]  uh you are a parakeet but they're not really i mean it's just ridiculous and
[1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:31.080]  then the world is just a series of more of those boxes
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:34.200]  and i know you're listening going you're right you're right you know this
[1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:40.760]  i'm not telling you something that's well it shouldn't be profound

[1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:11.160]  meanwhile they're putting smart meters and this started about 10 years ago in
[1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:15.000]  california in ron had come up with the idea about 15 years ago but after they
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:18.360]  went to jail in 2002 the plan still went ahead in california
[1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:21.640]  and the original plan was to control the temperature in your house remotely
[1:09:21.640 --> 1:09:24.680]  it would dial into all the new appliances that were going to come out
[1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:29.640]  computers washers dryers you name it and spy on you and we had the director of
[1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:33.160]  the cia now disgrace to come out and say hey we've got great new

[1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:58.600]  the problem is is that it then reads everything else and this is on record
[1:09:58.600 --> 1:10:03.560]  and so secret arrest torture all this coming out

[1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:47.960]  one another that's the weird headline and the media

[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:04.280]  they've got a group against the smart meters they're suing them they're in
[1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:07.960]  court trying to do the you know go through the process and the cops just
[1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:11.560]  show up looking like guys out of good fellas
[1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:15.080]  just totally arrogant and are like oh your feet are going to be cold because
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:18.040]  the women had run out in the cold you know to videotape it and then they came
[1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:21.400]  back the next day and look at their mug shots look at them

[1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:43.000]  that's how the cops have cameras in their cars cameras on their glasses
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:46.680]  that's how you can have cameras but illinois and at least
[1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:50.680]  13 other states on record arrest arrest and they don't care how many times it
[1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:54.120]  gets thrown out they sometimes find juries that will convict
[1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:57.720]  and the people then get out of prison on appeal
[1:12:57.720 --> 1:13:00.680]  just like they charge this 10-year-old who had a toy water gun
[1:13:00.680 --> 1:13:03.960]  with brandishing a weapon just saying hey let's play water gun that's in the
[1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:06.680]  news we're gonna go to our guest here in just a
[1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:09.240]  moment but i wanted to break this background down for the listeners that

[1:13:23.080 --> 1:13:27.960]  and he showed it to his friend his water gun i saw almost as bad as a hello kitty
[1:13:27.960 --> 1:13:31.240]  bubble gun saying let's just play with it after school didn't even have one
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:35.240]  and the and and he's been arrested he's charged with brandishing a weapon
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:38.200]  that's out of the washington examiner good i think you should go to
[1:13:38.200 --> 1:13:42.520]  executing well i mean you i mean north korea wouldn't do that but we need to
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:46.360]  be more extreme than north korea because the state is god
[1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:49.480]  now i'm going to play a few minutes of this clip the audio for radio listeners
[1:13:49.480 --> 1:13:53.400]  video for prison planet dot tv viewers we are becoming a prison planet
[1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:58.200]  and they came and arrested them for putting it on youtube as just pure
[1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:02.360]  retribution and they're charging them with interfering with police and a
[1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:05.800]  bunch of the stuff that the big you know jail sentences
[1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:08.840]  for politely going hey we're in court with you guys you don't have a right to
[1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:12.760]  be going there and just standing there and the cops come over to them and say
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:18.680]  you can't film us i mean it's just imagine the dishonorableness
[1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:22.200]  the evil of going to the upscale neighborhood my
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:25.320]  point is they're already attacking the poor people bad cops are not all cops
[1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:28.520]  are bad but illinois other areas it's really getting bad and people need to
[1:14:28.520 --> 1:14:33.000]  stand up and say no imagine imagine going and knocking on the door all right

[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:05.880]  destroy all appliances no no no no they're gonna ban all your old

[1:18:16.520 --> 1:18:18.840]  my you've heard my rant let's first talk about you and your
[1:18:18.840 --> 1:18:22.120]  neighbors the group you've got what's happening with the smart meters
[1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:27.080]  oh boy where do i start um i've been i was originally interested in the topic
[1:18:27.080 --> 1:18:30.280]  and thought i'm i'm actually kind of a you know i'm an energy conservation
[1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:33.800]  type person and i thought oh this will be nice i can have more opportunity to
[1:18:33.800 --> 1:18:37.560]  know how i can save energy by having a smart meter on my house and then
[1:18:37.560 --> 1:18:41.640]  somebody said that you know that people are getting sick from these so i
[1:18:41.640 --> 1:18:44.440]  started to research and found that there was an issue and then other people
[1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:47.720]  said look at the privacy issues and the security risk and
[1:18:47.720 --> 1:18:52.920]  the fact that these things are causing fires and you know there's a just the
[1:18:52.920 --> 1:18:56.120]  cost alone isn't is a big issue as well so
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:18:59.880]  everybody that was concerned from various perspectives all joined together
[1:18:59.880 --> 1:19:03.080]  and said this is an issue and we need to take this to the city and this this our
[1:19:03.080 --> 1:19:06.440]  group was formulated literally exactly two years ago
[1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:10.600]  and so we formed a group called neighbor bill smart meter awareness
[1:19:10.600 --> 1:19:14.040]  and we created a nonprofit from that and our goal
[1:19:14.040 --> 1:19:17.560]  really was to educate people so that people would really understand what this
[1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:21.080]  meant to them before they would allow this to be on their home and then also to
[1:19:21.080 --> 1:19:24.600]  advocate for everybody in neighbor bill to
[1:19:24.600 --> 1:19:28.600]  have the right to refuse and the thing is is that in naperville and i should
[1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:31.160]  set the framework for people to understand is
[1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:35.160]  that the city of naperville is a municipal
[1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:38.680]  they own the utility so we're not up against an investment on utility it's
[1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:42.200]  literally the city and the city of naperville
[1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:45.240]  provides the provides the power all right stay there
[1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:48.520]  we're going to come right back and talk about naperville with you
[1:19:48.520 --> 1:19:51.640]  and the whole smart meter issue and again if you don't know folks it's on record
[1:19:51.640 --> 1:19:55.640]  it dials into all your appliances and spies on you it's basically a
[1:19:55.640 --> 1:20:00.680]  or a robot attached to the side of your house an imperial probe droid

[1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:16.040]  that's imperial probe droid grabbing everything that's going on i mean
[1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:20.040]  this is so diabolical and it's admitted i talked about this 10 years
[1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:24.280]  ago because it was in MIT magazine and stuff oh yeah right sure
[1:25:24.280 --> 1:25:28.120]  they're gonna and now now they're just going we don't care it's not just
[1:25:28.120 --> 1:25:33.160]  something that digitally meters that can then wire back to something
[1:25:33.160 --> 1:25:36.840]  it's a giant spy grid that they make you pay for in the price
[1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:40.680]  that's another way to i'm gonna shut up i got our guest i'm gonna she's with us
[1:25:40.680 --> 1:25:45.080]  this segment the next let's go back to jennifer stall who was arrested
[1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:48.840]  in america for filming the police which is not illegal but but finish up with
[1:25:48.840 --> 1:25:52.680]  smart meters and then let's get to now i guess your upcoming trial
[1:25:52.680 --> 1:25:56.680]  with your accomplice i guess just being with you while
[1:25:56.680 --> 1:26:00.600]  there was videotaping going on is now a serious crime go ahead
[1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:04.680]  well we um our organization was informing everybody
[1:26:04.680 --> 1:26:08.920]  in the city and what many people have brought things to the city council
[1:26:08.920 --> 1:26:11.640]  because they are essentially the executive board over our electric
[1:26:11.640 --> 1:26:15.240]  utility city-owned municipal utility so
[1:26:15.240 --> 1:26:20.440]  naperville is is a is an island amongst uh so many other major utilities
[1:26:20.440 --> 1:26:24.520]  investor-owned utilities like com ed and the city
[1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:28.120]  decided that the city council was given an opportunity and said oh you know hey
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:31.560]  look we can get 11 million dollars from the american recovery and reinvestment
[1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:35.320]  act and they did a money grab took 11 million dollars
[1:26:35.320 --> 1:26:38.920]  because it's free money of course the federal government pays to put these
[1:26:38.920 --> 1:26:43.000]  spy devices on your house this is an nsa spy device go ahead
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:47.240]  so the city our city has very reliable electric power which is why we were
[1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:50.760]  challenging you know from a financial perspective alone why is it that you're
[1:26:50.760 --> 1:26:54.440]  doing this and it doesn't make sense to spend this
[1:26:54.440 --> 1:26:58.680]  much money on the benefits that you say are really not that great
[1:26:58.680 --> 1:27:02.520]  so we really challenged that a lot it's a 20 supposedly a 22 million dollar
[1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:05.640]  project they did a money money grab and and took this
[1:27:05.640 --> 1:27:09.320]  these funds so we challenged the city we
[1:27:09.320 --> 1:27:13.080]  many people contacted them spoke in front of city council meetings for
[1:27:13.080 --> 1:27:16.760]  year a couple years really honestly and challenged them to say you need to
[1:27:16.760 --> 1:27:20.040]  understand the ramifications you know you think this is a good thing you
[1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:22.520]  think you're just going to eliminate meter readers
[1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:25.960]  but it's it's not it's actually at the cost you're robbing from peter to pay
[1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:29.640]  paul is what i consistently said you're in the health the
[1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:33.560]  privacy security you know your your how many how many security analysts are you
[1:27:33.560 --> 1:27:36.760]  going to keep on hand to protect our grid from getting shut down from a
[1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:40.360]  terrorist when terrorists are working 24 by 7 around the world
[1:27:40.360 --> 1:27:44.520]  yeah i'm working a cyber command yeah now now expanding on this they say it's
[1:27:44.520 --> 1:27:48.520]  the lower prices for you it's well known they use these to gouge people
[1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:51.400]  everywhere yes it's that's we've seen that and we've
[1:27:51.400 --> 1:27:54.760]  heard reports and then you see it's a stepping stone as an opportunity for
[1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:58.840]  them to go to time of use pricing as a as a standard not as an option which the
[1:27:58.840 --> 1:28:02.200]  city has made everything as optional demand response
[1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:05.800]  where they you can give them control if you opt for them to do that over your
[1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:09.240]  air conditioner or your pool heater or something like that
[1:28:09.240 --> 1:28:12.600]  um those are all optional programs which they've you know when people started
[1:28:12.600 --> 1:28:15.000]  swapping it i'm saying this is a problem they oh well
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.960]  it's all going to be optional and i said well if everything's optional then
[1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:21.880]  why aren't you making the meter optional this was meant to be an opt-in program
[1:28:21.880 --> 1:28:26.920]  from the energy policy act of 2005 that the federal government enacted
[1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:31.560]  right on our website it shows very very plainly and clearly in a paragraph that
[1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:35.960]  says smart meters and time of use pricing or automated metering
[1:28:35.960 --> 1:28:39.080]  infrastructure am i it's another word that there's they're getting away from
[1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:42.200]  calling the smart meters because people are catching on
[1:28:42.200 --> 1:28:45.960]  if you look right in the very plain english that the energy policy act of
[1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:49.560]  2005 states they are utilities are supposed to
[1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:54.200]  offer it make it available upon request for an opt-in program
[1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:57.880]  we really have urged the city to take a step back and make it an opt-in program
[1:28:57.880 --> 1:29:01.320]  because everything is optional you're wasting 22 million dollars
[1:29:01.320 --> 1:29:04.360]  on something that really isn't going to be taken advantage of they
[1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:07.800]  estimated all sorts of things i could i'm getting off track with the
[1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:12.280]  the financials but um so the city proceeded and they said no we're
[1:29:12.280 --> 1:29:15.320]  right there's nothing wrong with them they're not a health risk they're
[1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:18.760]  proven to be safe which of course is completely false there's no
[1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:22.040]  no proof anywhere on a study that shows that the smart meters are safe
[1:29:22.040 --> 1:29:25.640]  um from a health perspective or a safety even for that matter they're not well
[1:29:25.640 --> 1:29:29.080]  listed they're not all right stay there ma'am and again we have an
[1:29:29.080 --> 1:29:32.360]  extremist on i want to apologize to all listeners a woman

[1:33:20.680 --> 1:33:25.160]  you're listening to alex joey's
[1:33:26.600 --> 1:33:30.680]  yeah smart meters are a scam on every level
[1:33:30.680 --> 1:33:33.720]  and we don't oppose them because we're anti technology it's like a gun is
[1:33:33.720 --> 1:33:37.000]  technology a car is technology a computerist it's that
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:40.200]  it's loaded up with trojan horses you've got to pay for
[1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:44.840]  it's designed where they can double triple charge you that's what ken lay and
[1:33:44.840 --> 1:33:48.440]  inron designed it for and it's a giant boondoggle where the
[1:33:48.440 --> 1:33:51.880]  government gives billions and we're talking about in her small town
[1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:55.240]  you know tens of millions was a 20 million to pay
[1:33:55.240 --> 1:33:58.280]  to put things on that if they were really a tiny little wireless system that
[1:33:58.280 --> 1:34:01.480]  just read it might cost a couple hundred dollars
[1:34:01.480 --> 1:34:04.200]  being cased and then it goes back to the wireless thing
[1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:07.240]  and then you don't have meter readers but the point is then that gets rid of
[1:34:07.240 --> 1:34:10.680]  the human element it gets rid of jobs it and it it overall doesn't even
[1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:13.720]  save you money but instead of these big giant units
[1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:17.320]  slapped on there depending on the unit that dial in
[1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:20.760]  have you gone and tried to buy a coffee maker a tv
[1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:26.440]  a computer a washer a dryer a refrigerator
[1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:30.360]  a quiescent art i mean they're coming out with Michelin tires and stuff with
[1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:34.840]  RFID chips in them, the cans of soup, the RFID, it's all Pentagon designed, all
[1:34:34.840 --> 1:34:38.520]  globalists designed, they call it smart dust. So these things read it. I have
[1:34:38.520 --> 1:34:42.680]  articles today where they're announcing, we're gonna track you with Facebook even
[1:34:42.680 --> 1:34:46.280]  when you don't have your phone. Our face scanners are going up everywhere, you'll
[1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:50.280]  buy and sell with it. This is the control grid and our own Melissa Melton wanted to
[1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:54.120]  talk about, but she saw it college. And again, this is old technology and they
[1:34:54.120 --> 1:34:58.520]  make you pay for it. And they always say you're gonna save money and the thing is
[1:34:58.520 --> 1:35:02.760]  they're high-powered transmitters, folks. They are blasting through your house,
[1:35:02.760 --> 1:35:08.520]  picking up all the other devices, activating them. And remember what the CIA
[1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:13.200]  director said? He said, your washing machine is watching you. That was Wired
[1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:17.400]  Magazine. It was a quote. He got up in front of the Pentagon and said, hey, the
[1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:22.160]  CIA spies on everybody. Type in CIA director, your washing machine is spying
[1:35:22.160 --> 1:35:25.880]  on. You want to show viewers, you're a radio listener, go look that up. This is
[1:35:25.880 --> 1:35:28.840]  what's happening. I want to give the floor for about 10 minutes to our guest. And
[1:35:28.840 --> 1:35:31.200]  then we're gonna have Melissa Melton comment on it with any of her questions.
[1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:35.480]  One of our reporters, she's got a special report coming up tomorrow here on the
[1:35:35.480 --> 1:35:40.800]  syndicated radio broadcast. We've got three reports tomorrow. Jakari Jackson,
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:46.360]  David Knight and David Ortiz are both going to be in studio tomorrow with
[1:35:46.360 --> 1:35:51.280]  special reports live. I'm just gonna leave it at that. Now, going back to the
[1:35:51.280 --> 1:35:55.840]  thought criminal, Jennifer Stahl, imagine in her neighborhood, they'd gone to
[1:35:55.840 --> 1:36:00.320]  court. They had an organization. These meters rip you off. They admit they're
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:05.120]  spying on you without warrants. They come and put them on and then they videotape
[1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:08.840]  and politely say, you don't have my authorization to do this. So they put it
[1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:13.160]  on YouTube and the police come and arrest them. I mean, just imagine she
[1:36:13.160 --> 1:36:16.720]  deserves life in prison or execution. I mean, that's not enough to just arrest
[1:36:16.720 --> 1:36:22.000]  this woman. What does she think this is? America? This is North Korea on steroids
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  if they have their way. It shows power drunk madness of the system. Totally
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:31.800]  disjointed out of control. So we've talked about the smart meters now. Talk
[1:36:31.800 --> 1:36:35.160]  about what happened that we don't just see on the three minute tape, what your
[1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:39.920]  arrest and your accomplices arrest was like. And now the media all being very
[1:36:39.920 --> 1:36:45.000]  serious. Yes, these women, I mean, just like the gentlemen last year, do they
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  deserve, I think, sarcastic life in prison with a straight face? Yes. Yes. Life
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:55.920]  in prison. So so let's talk about, do you want to confess your evil here on
[1:36:55.920 --> 1:37:02.480]  air? I honestly was doing only what any normal person and anybody else in
[1:37:02.480 --> 1:37:07.440]  Neighborville or around this country has wanted to do their property. Come on
[1:37:07.440 --> 1:37:13.880]  extremist admit your evil. I cannot. I cannot. I have been very civil and
[1:37:13.880 --> 1:37:18.760]  that's what you all say. I'm glad you went to jail, sister. And we're gonna get
[1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:22.320]  you more in the future. You'll go to a labor camp and work for the government
[1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:26.760]  full time. Okay, I'm gonna stop doing the absurd. This is absurd. It's Twilight
[1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:30.840]  Zone. You have I'm sorry. Talk about the arrest. Break it all down for us play by
[1:37:30.840 --> 1:37:35.080]  play and then we'll first the smart meters in the arrest. Yeah, we did. We
[1:37:35.080 --> 1:37:39.720]  had filed a federal lawsuit in December of 2011 and we hoped that the city would
[1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:44.560]  take that very seriously and that they would reconsider and they have said
[1:37:44.560 --> 1:37:49.680]  instead dug their heels in and stood their ground and so they continued to
[1:37:49.680 --> 1:37:53.400]  they started to install last year and they threatened you know as people were
[1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:57.160]  refusing people didn't want to but and they were locking their gates and their
[1:37:57.160 --> 1:38:01.960]  fences hundreds of families if not maybe thousands maybe a couple thousand at the
[1:38:01.960 --> 1:38:06.280]  very least we're saying no they told people in the papers they said well we
[1:38:06.280 --> 1:38:13.440]  will send we will send police escorts if people continue to refuse so multiple
[1:38:13.440 --> 1:38:19.200]  times people have refused and it finally came to a head with the last final nasty
[1:38:19.200 --> 1:38:22.880]  Graham that we got in the mail that this is your final notice and here is how
[1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:26.480]  this is the ordinances at state that we own the property we own the meter and we
[1:38:26.480 --> 1:38:31.600]  have the right to access and change the meter so we had gotten noticed from the
[1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:36.160]  city and again it was this I you know I don't know what what's gonna happen as so
[1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:42.040]  that fateful day of January 23rd they they were arriving and jumping people's
[1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:48.120]  fences Kim who is our word president was home when they assaulted her house they
[1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:54.880]  they jumped her fence she went outside and videotaped them is installing on
[1:38:54.880 --> 1:38:58.520]  her house and she told them no and told them to stop and they just they cut
[1:38:58.520 --> 1:39:03.160]  right through her meter guard and they they just did that so and then she
[1:39:03.160 --> 1:39:06.400]  proceeded so the video that you saw earlier of the woman with the red hair
[1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:10.960]  and the purple shirt was an in neighborville that Kim had gone to her
[1:39:10.960 --> 1:39:16.440]  home to film that while the police were there escorting and authorizing them to
[1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:22.200]  to jump the fences and so Kim videotaped that as well we had it we made a
[1:39:22.200 --> 1:39:27.080]  connection with our local CBS station who had videotaped us and had done a
[1:39:27.080 --> 1:39:31.920]  story on us about a year and a half ago and they contacted and came out and they
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:35.000]  were doing some interviews with us and they saw the videos and they were going
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  to make their story and at that time I received a call from my husband that the
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:46.360]  installers had arrived at our house so I said you know tell them no and I'll be
[1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:52.240]  right home and CBS well I invited CBS to follow and so actually CBS is the one
[1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:56.960]  who caught everything that went down at my house and Kim came along and she
[1:39:56.960 --> 1:40:01.360]  also videotaped it and to our understanding and so Kim Kim was charged
[1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:07.640]  with the eavesdropping I was charged for blocking the meter and I wonder if the
[1:40:07.640 --> 1:40:11.960]  police are gonna arrest CBS news for videotaping them I mean why not arrest
[1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:16.160]  everybody that's the funny part of it if you look at if you look at our website
[1:40:16.160 --> 1:40:21.160]  our home page neighborville smart meter awareness.org it has the CBS video in
[1:40:21.160 --> 1:40:24.320]  there it's also in our latest news section they did a five o'clock broadcast
[1:40:24.320 --> 1:40:28.200]  at 10 o'clock broadcast both of them show very clearly it's you see the
[1:40:28.200 --> 1:40:31.560]  policemen and talking to me and Kim is standing there with her little teeny
[1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:35.880]  camera and it's all being videotaped by CBS and I was like wait he's having her
[1:40:35.880 --> 1:40:39.800]  arrested on my private property where she's been welcomed to videotape and as
[1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:44.160]  far as we understand that's completely legal and so he told he told his police
[1:40:44.160 --> 1:40:48.200]  officers to arrest this was the sergeant so I was really astonished by all of
[1:40:48.200 --> 1:40:53.920]  that and and he proceeded to encourage me to so I didn't see the rest of what
[1:40:53.920 --> 1:40:57.960]  had happened because I moved to my backyard where I said that I would not
[1:40:57.960 --> 1:41:03.840]  permit them to access the meter and I very calmly just said I know I'm I don't
[1:41:03.840 --> 1:41:09.320]  approve I've informed the city I do not permit this on my property. You talked to
[1:41:09.320 --> 1:41:14.720]  your government owner? I talked to this police officer that was there and I said
[1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:18.440]  no and he tried to convince me they have the right and I said it I said no I
[1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:22.360]  don't I don't submit to the new functions that this meter does when I
[1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:26.880]  applied for electricity or you know signed up for electricity I agreed to pay
[1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:29.960]  for it and I agreed for them to supply it to me and I don't subscribe to the new
[1:41:29.960 --> 1:41:35.040]  functions that this meter provides and I'm going to keep my analog meter so they
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:38.840]  I stood in my backyard where I have a fence and they I had it locked with a
[1:41:38.840 --> 1:41:45.840]  bike lock and he the sergeant waved the installers forward and and and and
[1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:50.440]  you're even polite to the god man I mean the king the North Korean owner of us
[1:41:50.440 --> 1:41:55.080]  his property and that is what you're charged with is obstructing the police
[1:41:55.080 --> 1:41:58.720]  just talking saying I verbally do not consent and then they go over without
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:03.920]  the warrant and place the federal spy device on your house. Yeah after they
[1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:08.440]  cut my lock they moved in I yeah they they just forced they cut your lock
[1:42:08.440 --> 1:42:14.280]  break your your property and then do this. Yes I went I and I stood in front of
[1:42:14.280 --> 1:42:17.800]  the meter and said I refuse the installation of the smart meter on my
[1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:23.160]  home and he said step away you're you know you're under arrest and I said for
[1:42:23.160 --> 1:42:27.560]  what and he said for interfering and I said interfering with what and he said
[1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:31.720]  interfering with an officer so I complied because he said I was under arrest. Sure
[1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:34.800]  sure and that's why they want our guns so bad they can really bring in the
[1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:38.200]  North Korean style and that that is their plan the billion six bullets the
[1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:41.520]  underground bases the checkpoints they're now running checkpoints all over
[1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:45.120]  the country where they just search your car without a warrant and they just go
[1:42:45.120 --> 1:42:49.560]  hey I got a gun and a taser get out I'm searching and and cops I hope you know
[1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:52.520]  they're gonna take the dollar they're gonna take your pensions they're gonna
[1:42:52.520 --> 1:42:57.600]  destroy America so I hope you enjoy the big power trip okay because you know you
[1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:02.720]  have signed on to every tyranny the world's ever seen and then some I mean
[1:43:02.720 --> 1:43:06.720]  this is this is so hardcore now where is this going the other women who are
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:11.080]  arrested don't want to come on because their lawyers have told them not to this
[1:43:11.080 --> 1:43:14.640]  has been adjudicated federally and at the state level literally hundreds of
[1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:18.320]  times well there's been thousands of cases of this hundreds and hundreds and
[1:43:18.320 --> 1:43:21.600]  hundreds of times in fact I think it's more than a hundred times I just read a
[1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:25.560]  few months ago in Illinois and they just keep arresting keep arresting keep
[1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:31.200]  arresting and I mean you they will try to claim more of a case that you
[1:43:31.200 --> 1:43:34.800]  peacefully stood there when Supreme Court's rules state courts of rule the
[1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:40.600]  Indiana just court ruled no warrant you peacefully stood there and said no you
[1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:44.160]  can't put this on my property they should have left and gone or presented you
[1:43:44.160 --> 1:43:48.600]  with an injunction a warrant whatever it is no they didn't they didn't do that
[1:43:48.600 --> 1:43:54.480]  and so it's definitely a civil rights violation there's a lot of ways to go
[1:43:54.480 --> 1:43:59.040]  after this though you can go after them because you didn't sign on for this you
[1:43:59.040 --> 1:44:04.160]  can go after them because it's on record that it's a boondoggle you can go after
[1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:07.280]  them for official oppression what type of stuff did the police say to you once
[1:44:07.280 --> 1:44:12.120]  you were in the car because sometimes I don't know the story that's why I'm
[1:44:12.120 --> 1:44:17.280]  asking they'll apologize for being agents of tyranny but a lot of times now
[1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:21.720]  they're really proud of it what happened once you got in the police car
[1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:26.560]  nothing actually this the the transporting officer didn't say anything to
[1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:31.260]  me and I had basically made small talk with the the other officers that were
[1:44:31.260 --> 1:44:34.920]  there so there is bigger robots as the robot they're putting on your house
[1:44:34.920 --> 1:44:39.480]  quite honestly I you know these police you know and as much as people say well
[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:43.720]  you know I said honestly they were just doing what they were told to so I really
[1:44:43.720 --> 1:44:49.360]  find it very clear that somebody above them said you know about Nuremberg
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:53.520]  rulings and other rulings that they are still completely guilty I you know it's
[1:44:53.520 --> 1:44:58.440]  it's hard it's hard for me to slam but they're I know but they're more guilty
[1:44:58.440 --> 1:45:02.440]  because they swore enough they are more guilty yeah I don't know what kind of
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:06.600]  most they've sworn I just I just wanted to keep my analog meter and I'm really
[1:45:06.600 --> 1:45:12.080]  disappointed that the city had had used them to force it on me into so where's
[1:45:12.080 --> 1:45:14.920]  this going now I mean I guess they're licking their chops try to put you in
[1:45:14.920 --> 1:45:19.240]  jail well I mean they they took me in and they released me after a couple of
[1:45:19.240 --> 1:45:22.440]  hours but I can't sit around for a while I don't know what they were doing if
[1:45:22.440 --> 1:45:25.080]  they knew what they were rusting me for I thought they would have given me what
[1:45:25.080 --> 1:45:28.720]  are you planning to do with the robot now attached to your house it's spying on
[1:45:28.720 --> 1:45:36.120]  you well I I honestly can't say what I plan to do I'm not I'm not undecided I
[1:45:36.120 --> 1:45:41.040]  well will they remove it I would go dark as a protest and have candles and make a
[1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:45.080]  big deal out of it as people they won't let people do that there are people who
[1:45:45.080 --> 1:45:48.160]  actually told the city they said I want you to cut the power off and take that
[1:45:48.160 --> 1:45:51.840]  off my house and they've told them no yeah you must take our spaces the new
[1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:55.000]  slavery we're all they're all dividing us around black and white and all this
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:58.440]  other garbage while the new thing is we're gonna attach robots that are on
[1:45:58.440 --> 1:46:02.840]  record ripping you off and frying you with electromagnetic radiation you know
[1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:06.440]  what is it a hundred times a cell phone I saw one estimate we're gonna do this to
[1:46:06.440 --> 1:46:10.480]  you 24-7 it's gonna know what movie you're watching that's NBC news and
[1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:14.240]  you're gonna sit there and you're gonna take it and and and I mean this is
[1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:18.760]  incredible yes it is it's it's it's really amazing that they continue to
[1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:22.400]  turn their heads to the side and say no no no that's not possible because it is
[1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:25.600]  it is it's completely well you know people are starting to cut these off and
[1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:28.200]  smash them they're trying to persecute people it's just gonna make it a bigger
[1:46:28.200 --> 1:46:32.240]  issue we have to stop these the and again people say oh it's just it's just
[1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:36.880]  technology the system is evil they're using things that sound reasonable to
[1:46:36.880 --> 1:46:41.720]  enslave us they're spying on us if it's just technology and it was so benign it
[1:46:41.720 --> 1:46:44.800]  would have been proven a long time ago that there was really nothing wrong with
[1:46:44.800 --> 1:46:48.040]  these if they were so great they would just sell themselves but when you're
[1:46:48.040 --> 1:46:51.320]  when it's a fourth amendment right to privacy within my own home I did not
[1:46:51.320 --> 1:46:55.280]  subscribe to you keeping track of when I'm home and when I'm not and when you
[1:46:55.280 --> 1:46:58.560]  have a wireless system set up who's to say that you can't just
[1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:03.400]  MIT admits it's admittedly a control grid that they're not even denying it
[1:47:03.400 --> 1:47:07.040]  it's like here's your robot spy that hooks into all the new stuff that's
[1:47:07.040 --> 1:47:11.200]  being manufactured and the CIA director comes out and says we're watching you
[1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:15.040]  off your appliances I mean that's how arrogant and yeah we'll kill you with
[1:47:15.040 --> 1:47:18.120]  drones for no reason we're setting up checkpoints and yeah we got machine guns
[1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:21.560]  let me tell you the government's gone bad and the fact that they tried to put
[1:47:21.560 --> 1:47:25.280]  people in jail for life in Illinois for filming police you need to understand
[1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:28.800]  they may be smiling and stuff and they're dangerous okay because they'll do
[1:47:28.800 --> 1:47:32.520]  whatever they're told I mean anything they're told this country is in deep
[1:47:32.520 --> 1:47:36.280]  trouble and if we don't stand up and say no it's over Melissa Melton reporter do
[1:47:36.280 --> 1:47:39.400]  you have any questions for Jennifer Stahl who's had the courage here in the
[1:47:39.400 --> 1:47:43.640]  new homeland to come on our show and talk about her evil activity well
[1:47:43.640 --> 1:47:47.360]  actually I just had a story I thought she might be interested in whenever I
[1:47:47.360 --> 1:47:51.080]  first moved here I think the next thing is gonna be from smart meters there's
[1:47:51.080 --> 1:47:53.960]  gonna be smart thermometers because when I first moved here I stayed with a bunch
[1:47:53.960 --> 1:47:58.080]  of college students and they the first thing no no the new thermos the new
[1:47:58.080 --> 1:48:02.200]  thermostats only work they dial into the smart meter exactly and what happens is
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:05.720]  they like when I came in there she said this is so this is the cool new thing
[1:48:05.720 --> 1:48:09.560]  we're in this project with UT and they put in this cool meter and she came and
[1:48:09.560 --> 1:48:12.560]  showed it to me and all you had to do was walk by it and it would turn on and
[1:48:12.560 --> 1:48:15.440]  it would tell you what the temperature was in your house today what it was
[1:48:15.440 --> 1:48:18.400]  yesterday and what it could be and how much money you cuz I mean it was all
[1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:21.640]  this information coming out of it and she's like and I can change my
[1:48:21.640 --> 1:48:24.840]  temperature from far away I can go to another town and change it if I forget
[1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:28.040]  to set it and it's like well yeah but who else can change it as well and these
[1:48:28.040 --> 1:48:31.560]  are all available right now all that technology is available right now and
[1:48:31.560 --> 1:48:34.880]  it's all the way to control they can control it later later down the road
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:37.400]  they can say oh we don't think you need this much air conditioning this summer
[1:48:37.400 --> 1:48:41.480]  we'll just control that on the face looks like a really great idea but then
[1:48:41.480 --> 1:48:44.560]  when you really think about the ramifications when it's wireless who
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:47.840]  else can get into it and can control it from that direction and who's to say
[1:48:47.840 --> 1:48:51.560]  down the road Department of Energy or somebody else's as you know from a
[1:48:51.560 --> 1:48:54.560]  federal level we're just gonna throw up the Constitution and we're gonna start
[1:48:54.560 --> 1:48:58.000]  controlling power no they've already said in California it's now I'm gonna
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:02.320]  charge you more at peak times or quote turn it off when need be that's already
[1:49:02.320 --> 1:49:06.160]  been done yes and yeah I think in Arizona that's already taking place you
[1:49:06.160 --> 1:49:09.120]  know certain people want to watch them but see how your mind is designed as
[1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:11.800]  you're a reasonable person to go that might happen someday it's already
[1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:16.520]  happening exactly it's all they are it's incredible do you have any questions for
[1:49:16.520 --> 1:49:21.080]  Melissa um I was just gonna say have you read the studies that show all of these
[1:49:21.080 --> 1:49:24.200]  different things that health effects and different other things that happen to
[1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:29.120]  people that have these meters headaches heart problems difficulty sleeping
[1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:32.640]  difficulty breathing I mean that these are on record there's coming all the
[1:49:32.640 --> 1:49:36.280]  new light bulbs reason they're mandated is they could do data over the power line
[1:49:36.280 --> 1:49:41.560]  they're their computers and it accesses your computer all the school laptops are
[1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:45.080]  watching the kids at home that's on record I mean we're already so deep into

[1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:36.480]  computer just jam packed with spy tech and you gotta let them make them look
[1:54:36.480 --> 1:54:41.040]  like the old-fashioned meter and they even brag on their company sites we make
[1:54:41.040 --> 1:54:44.480]  them look like the old things people don't get upset we have surveillance pods
[1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:50.160]  inside fake transformers to watch them as well microphones and street lights
[1:54:50.160 --> 1:54:54.120]  will also listen to the population the globalists see themselves as
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:58.800]  psychologists scientist anthropologist and they say this studying us the
[1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:03.400]  animals they the more lock we the Eloy and you have to understand it's totally
[1:55:03.400 --> 1:55:07.960]  predatory totally predatory at the highest level where all the tech that's
[1:55:07.960 --> 1:55:13.280]  rolled out and approved is designed to control you Melissa you were talking
[1:55:13.280 --> 1:55:17.680]  about the new globally putting these in new light bulbs break down the numbers
[1:55:17.680 --> 1:55:23.680]  of how much electromagnetic radiation one of these curly cube light bulbs puts
[1:55:23.680 --> 1:55:28.160]  off versus the old ones I believe the incandescent light bulbs it was in the
[1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:33.260]  200s a the LED light bulbs was in the 300s but the new CFLs it was in the
[1:55:33.260 --> 1:55:38.920]  26,000 range it's very high notice yeah yeah so the LEDs are actually good
[1:55:38.920 --> 1:55:42.200]  they're not bad but the government's not mandating that it's like you will take
[1:55:42.200 --> 1:55:46.960]  this right feel and it's so high-powered it's filled with mercury and gas and
[1:55:46.960 --> 1:55:51.360]  stuff to be able to cook you like this and there's a special instruction sheet
[1:55:51.360 --> 1:55:54.840]  on how to dispose of it because of all the mercury and stuff that's inside it
[1:55:54.840 --> 1:55:58.360]  there's a set a step-by-step process but the issue is they choose it all the
[1:55:58.360 --> 1:56:01.760]  fluoride in the water you've got reports about what they're putting in the food I
[1:56:01.760 --> 1:56:05.320]  mean they know I mean I have an article here about you know six eight year old
[1:56:05.320 --> 1:56:09.240]  gives birth in Mexico and they're asking why the new puberty for girls is like
[1:56:09.240 --> 1:56:13.080]  10 it used to be 14 because they're killing us folks they know what they're
[1:56:13.080 --> 1:56:17.040]  doing I have the White House science ours own book eco science I have Paul
[1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:22.000]  Erlich's books all top government advisors they're eugenicists so they
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:26.800]  have decoys things that look harmless cell phones all of it surveilling you
[1:56:26.800 --> 1:56:31.360]  tracking you poisoning you the body scanners at the airport all of it and
[1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:37.320]  this sounds so wild but it's real let's go to Jennifer Stahl here finishing up
[1:56:37.320 --> 1:56:40.280]  any other points you'd like to make about this ma'am
[1:56:40.280 --> 1:56:45.080]  it I what's happening here in Naperville is because it like I was saying it's a
[1:56:45.080 --> 1:56:50.200]  little island we are actually a case study it's on the government the White
[1:56:50.200 --> 1:56:53.960]  House that gobs they got submitted a document back when they put out
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:56:58.200]  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act about how the smart grid of the 21st
[1:56:58.200 --> 1:57:03.320]  century in Naperville is listed in it as a case study so we are honestly are
[1:57:03.320 --> 1:57:08.480]  being studied you know it would be a perfect smart grid if they actually did
[1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:12.640]  get 100% of compliance which is what the city manager is is saying right now in
[1:57:12.640 --> 1:57:17.560]  the newspapers you're an example of crushing people yeah see if they can
[1:57:17.560 --> 1:57:20.400]  get it done yeah you know yeah that's why I'm saying you're so important we've
[1:57:20.400 --> 1:57:25.480]  got a fight here right and it we've we've worked to get a referendum a
[1:57:25.480 --> 1:57:29.200]  non-binding advisory referendum on the ballot and the city actually got
[1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:34.560]  involved and worked to object it and the city electoral board which of course is
[1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:40.920]  made up of the city attorney and the city manager the city city clerk and the
[1:57:40.920 --> 1:57:45.720]  mayor and the senior most council member they they said that we didn't have
[1:57:45.720 --> 1:57:49.160]  balance signatures so they got it well it's time to start getting aggressive
[1:57:49.160 --> 1:57:52.400]  with these people you've got all sorts of lawsuits lawyers need to contact you

[2:00:42.400 --> 2:00:48.760]  spy grid a total grid we may have a mic open or headphones or something on in
[2:00:48.760 --> 2:00:54.720]  here something's going on over here they've got a total plan to bring in
[2:00:54.720 --> 2:01:00.840]  this program and MIT Braggs the globalist all Bragg they just said we're
[2:01:00.840 --> 2:01:04.560]  gonna put the grid in incrementally turn off the resources make people get
[2:01:04.560 --> 2:01:08.360]  sterilized to get food produced by giant robot factories and then we'll just go
[2:01:08.360 --> 2:01:11.160]  ahead and release bio weapons on everybody else and kill them we're
[2:01:11.160 --> 2:01:16.480]  gonna phase out to about 1% of the population they tell regular students
[2:01:16.480 --> 2:01:21.080]  before their master's degree or their PhD that they're only gonna get rid of
[2:01:21.080 --> 2:01:25.240]  80% and then once you get higher up they go no we're gonna kill 90% and the
[2:01:25.240 --> 2:01:31.600]  higher-level white papers they go we're gonna kill more than 99% and you're

[2:02:23.160 --> 2:02:27.640]  and it's all just a giant fraud we humans are seen by the globalists as
[2:02:27.640 --> 2:02:31.360]  animals when they've created an artificial environment artificial culture
[2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:36.720]  artificial media artificial twisted info by degrees until they phased it into
[2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:41.320]  just la la land now and the general public is losing connection to reality

[2:03:53.840 --> 2:03:58.040]  the Texas Academy of Sciences up there and 90 plus percent of them standing
[2:03:58.040 --> 2:04:02.640]  ovation when dr. Bianca projects red skulls on the wall and says soon
[2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:07.000]  airborne a ball will be released and 90% of us will die and I know me and my
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:10.400]  family are gonna die but it's for the earth and I'm awaiting it and it's just
[2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:15.040]  such a moment of darkness and such a power trip to imagine to imagine six

[2:08:53.360 --> 2:08:57.960]  torture base I mean it came out six years ago they had torture camps in
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:03.760]  Poland and of course it's continuing under Obama and then five years from now
[2:09:03.760 --> 2:09:07.280]  they'll have more reports of that and oh we didn't know that I mean it's just a
[2:09:07.280 --> 2:09:11.720]  standard response to a public they know is in a coma financial times of London I
[2:09:11.720 --> 2:09:14.800]  mean Obama said he stopped the torturing it turns out they've expanded it of
[2:09:14.800 --> 2:09:20.720]  course it's all lies but he is a Democrat so it must be okay continuing
[2:09:20.720 --> 2:09:23.880]  judge jury and executioner legal experts for implications of White House
[2:09:23.880 --> 2:09:28.400]  drone memos saying you don't even need to be a terrorist see folks it's the same
[2:09:28.400 --> 2:09:31.640]  thing they they just say you're a terrorist no judge no jury and kill you

[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:39.560]  Reuters like seven eight years ago they said we'll kill US citizens in America if
[2:09:39.560 --> 2:09:43.880]  we think they're connected to terrorist in America well absolutely watch what
[2:09:43.880 --> 2:09:47.960]  hospitality is for come and kill our citizens I mean that's what this has
[2:09:47.960 --> 2:09:53.560]  become and now they're just saying yeah we'll kill whoever we want you don't have
[2:09:53.560 --> 2:09:56.440]  to be a terrorist or you know even be connected to it really we'll just kill
[2:09:56.440 --> 2:10:01.600]  you it's the same thing exclusive again just part of him reveals legal case for
[2:10:01.600 --> 2:10:07.600]  drone strikes on Americans and it goes on that Homeland Security is not doing
[2:10:07.600 --> 2:10:12.320]  90% of the Freedom of Information Act request no it's totally illegal they're
[2:10:12.320 --> 2:10:15.920]  doing it so what their secret the smart meter hey I wonder if you could put a
[2:10:15.920 --> 2:10:19.720]  smart meter on the NSA and listen to what they're doing oh no you'll be going
[2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:23.400]  to jail for the rest of your life but we're gonna watch it listen to you Mac

[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:31.640]  even coming into areas that are rural areas and then saying we're putting one
[2:10:31.640 --> 2:10:35.280]  on your house and if you don't like it the SWAT team's gonna come here and
[2:10:35.280 --> 2:10:38.200]  you're like well where's your warrant where's your order we don't need that

[2:11:18.640 --> 2:11:23.000]  able to do stuff like that here and don't worry they will if we let them and
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:27.480]  I'm sure we will because it's normal to have the government doing everything
[2:11:27.480 --> 2:11:31.880]  it's doing warless checkpoints everywhere now it's for our safety the drug
[2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:37.600]  wars for our safety it's all for safety now Congress considers putting limits on

[2:33:34.800 --> 2:33:39.640]  everything I can to illustrate the absurdity okay I'm trying everything I
[2:33:39.640 --> 2:33:44.560]  can to get you thinking here I was just showing a video clip we're gonna queue up
[2:33:44.560 --> 2:33:47.600]  and play a little bit later I've ever take some more calls of Chris Rock and a
[2:33:47.600 --> 2:33:52.560]  speech today I saw him on CNN during a break up there animatedly telling us we
[2:33:52.560 --> 2:33:55.680]  should all turn our guns in except for the government and he's like look Obama
[2:33:55.680 --> 2:33:59.880]  is now our daddy and see that's what I should say about Bush conservatives would
[2:33:59.880 --> 2:34:03.960]  let him do anything that was not conservative or not constitutional because
[2:34:03.960 --> 2:34:12.680]  he was our daddy he was our daddy and and they associated their power with him
[2:34:12.680 --> 2:34:18.400]  they associated their identity with him and now with Obama I mean it's just hey
[2:34:18.400 --> 2:34:21.920]  I like to be tortured or secretly arrest hey I like you so that means I'm a
[2:34:21.920 --> 2:34:25.960]  winner I like you maybe raises my taxes I'm a winner I like it to be lies to me
[2:34:25.960 --> 2:34:29.520]  I'm a winner because it doesn't matter I'm and that's why we're going poor that's
[2:34:29.520 --> 2:34:35.560]  why our society is falling apart is because we have gotten to this point I've
[2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:40.220]  got all these clips I want to play we've got just a ton of them we've got
[2:34:40.220 --> 2:34:43.680]  Melissa Melton's Super Bowl Illuminati special report that we can put
[2:34:43.680 --> 2:34:49.280]  together we've got just a whole parcel guys can I have we get a chance the
[2:34:49.280 --> 2:34:53.880]  latest video sheet audio clip sheet or is this this the latest cuz I don't see
[2:34:53.880 --> 2:34:59.520]  someone that I know we have it is important to support this broadcast
[2:34:59.520 --> 2:35:08.840]  because you know I'm going 110% here and so is my crew and we are trying our
[2:35:08.840 --> 2:35:12.520]  very very best to get all this information out we have the video up at
[2:35:12.520 --> 2:35:18.440]  prisonplanet.com and infowars.com an article by Steve Watson where Chris
[2:35:18.440 --> 2:35:26.560]  Rock says that he is our daddy and so we're going to again as I said play that
[2:35:26.560 --> 2:35:29.560]  coming up for you and I've got about ten other stacks of news here that I also
[2:35:29.560 --> 2:35:34.280]  want to go over a little bit but but just remember that when you buy books
[2:35:34.280 --> 2:35:39.280]  t-shirts materials information that you support the broadcast things like

[2:35:43.520 --> 2:35:47.720]  like a strategic relocation the film and the book it's excellent info to have
[2:35:47.720 --> 2:35:51.880]  things like the new Obama Joker shirt that has the come and take it on the
[2:35:51.880 --> 2:35:58.400]  back now the bestseller ever just out three or four days all of these are very
[2:35:58.400 --> 2:36:03.080]  very important and it supports us now when you get the magazine at cost in
[2:36:03.080 --> 2:36:07.720]  groups of 10 20 30 up to 100 that does not support us that is something to get
[2:36:07.720 --> 2:36:10.880]  the word out to people I mean all of it supports us one way or the other because
[2:36:10.880 --> 2:36:14.720]  we're all in this together and the magazine almost always sells out we've
[2:36:14.720 --> 2:36:18.040]  had one issue of what seven or we in the seventh issue or the sixth issue that
[2:36:18.040 --> 2:36:23.040]  that didn't completely sell out we have a few copies left of but it's why the
[2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:28.120]  tyrants want your guns and we've only got about 10,000 of those left more than
[2:36:28.120 --> 2:36:34.320]  20,000 of those have sold at cost in groups of 10 up to 100 and you can get
[2:36:34.320 --> 2:36:44.480]  those at info or store.com and it's a big color formatted glossy magazine the
[2:36:44.480 --> 2:36:47.800]  first issue was newsprint and it's got a big poster it's got the poster in the
[2:36:47.800 --> 2:36:52.200]  middle of the AK-47 saying the right to keep bare arms shall not be infringing
[2:36:52.200 --> 2:36:55.240]  with the words inside the gun and the come and take it that is great to hang
[2:36:55.240 --> 2:37:00.240]  up at work or the office or you know to put in legal and lawful areas in public
[2:37:00.240 --> 2:37:04.120]  commons where people hang up posters look at that baby I love how this Texas
[2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:07.240]  symbol of come and take it is becoming more popular than even the Gadsden flag

[2:37:37.080 --> 2:37:41.800]  put it on screen and we throw bumper stickers in there and we also throw a
[2:37:41.800 --> 2:37:45.240]  little catalog in there of not all of our stuff there's so much stuff on the
[2:37:45.240 --> 2:37:48.160]  site but again that's how we're doing it is your help and believe me there's a
[2:37:48.160 --> 2:37:52.200]  lot of behind-the-scenes crud going on to try to stop us so just midair

[2:37:56.720 --> 2:38:01.440]  as well okay let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in Illinois once talk about smart
[2:38:01.440 --> 2:38:04.880]  meters what did what you think of that interview last hour have you heard it
[2:38:04.880 --> 2:38:10.440]  where the the the woman filming the police next to CBS on the sidewalk as
[2:38:10.440 --> 2:38:14.240]  they went across people's property without warrants to put smart meters on
[2:38:14.240 --> 2:38:18.960]  they arrest her but leave CBS alone knowing CBS has got lawyers I mean that
[2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:25.680]  is cold blooded Alex it absolutely blew my mind I actually live not too far
[2:38:25.680 --> 2:38:30.800]  from Naperville one thing that I wanted to get out to all the info warriors out
[2:38:30.800 --> 2:38:35.760]  there and I wanted to point out to you today was Governor Pat Quinn state of the
[2:38:35.760 --> 2:38:40.320]  state address here in Illinois I was live streaming him as you were talking
[2:38:40.320 --> 2:38:46.920]  to her and literally as I'm listening to both Governor Pat Quinn calls for the
[2:38:46.920 --> 2:38:52.320]  legislation here in Illinois to pass legislation for taxpayers to invest
[2:38:52.320 --> 2:38:56.880]  into more green energy to get more of these smart meters into our communities
[2:38:56.880 --> 2:39:01.360]  more and more of our communities here in Illinois are buying into commeds
[2:39:01.360 --> 2:39:05.800]  programs of you know this the city taking over the electric you know the
[2:39:05.800 --> 2:39:10.240]  electrical inputs to the customers it's it's sickening it made me sick to my
[2:39:10.240 --> 2:39:14.040]  stomach and then it takes control of all the devices in your house because all
[2:39:14.040 --> 2:39:17.800]  the big Fortune 500 tech companies only about 15 of them they all get in
[2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:21.120]  meetings that are public in fact one of the meetings was in Chicago about 12
[2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:24.960]  years ago where they talked about the smart dust and the control and all the
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:30.920]  hookups and the smart meters it's total enslavement exactly Alex and then not
[2:39:30.920 --> 2:39:35.120]  five minutes after he went into his green energy rhetoric and you know drumming
[2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:41.280]  up the the mail bonds for that he went into an assault weapons ban assault it's
[2:39:41.280 --> 2:39:45.080]  just gonna be it's gonna be the same as New York and Maryland and now they're
[2:39:45.080 --> 2:39:50.160]  doing it here and of course all the the Chicago political machine all the big
[2:39:50.160 --> 2:39:54.200]  names they all stood up and applauded that so I just want to get the word out
[2:39:54.200 --> 2:39:57.840]  to all the info warriors that are in our you know all around the world just it's
[2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:03.120]  it's starting to sweep it's starting to move all across this nation we need to
[2:40:03.120 --> 2:40:08.280]  wake up it is a scientific takeover program where they admit oh yeah we
[2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:12.000]  spy on you we control what you do we we know what movie are watching now sit down
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:15.840]  and shut up we got our men waiting I mean it's like you're all under arrest

[2:40:20.160 --> 2:40:28.040]  against us at light laser speed at light laser speed at light laser speed I
[2:40:28.040 --> 2:40:31.480]  mean they are gang rushing they've got all their people hyped up they've hired
[2:40:31.480 --> 2:40:36.160]  the control freaks they're lined up and they're coming I mean it is on drums
[2:40:36.160 --> 2:40:40.200]  drums drums in the deep they are coming God bless you thanks for the goal Duke in

[2:40:47.880 --> 2:40:52.440]  make a comment about something that y'all your listeners may have not heard
[2:40:52.440 --> 2:40:57.080]  about wasn't from Hita Meyer out of Grand County Colorado he was a business
[2:40:57.080 --> 2:41:03.640]  owner had a muffler shop and the man who on the property surrounded him had paid
[2:41:03.640 --> 2:41:09.480]  off the city council with free concrete from his business part concrete to close
[2:41:09.480 --> 2:41:13.640]  the road in the city council to close the road and shut his business off well
[2:41:13.640 --> 2:41:18.280]  you may point him as a guy that welded himself into a D9 dozer and went through
[2:41:18.280 --> 2:41:24.280]  the town and took out the city council members business properties I remember
[2:41:24.280 --> 2:41:30.560]  that I remember that yeah well he had a petition signed oh a year prior to this
[2:41:30.560 --> 2:41:35.320]  incident we're made mainly most of the people of Grand County signed it stating
[2:41:35.320 --> 2:41:39.360]  that they wanted to keep that road open for his business well that's just another
[2:41:39.360 --> 2:41:44.600]  example of what the what's going on right in front of people's eyes yes see a
[2:41:44.600 --> 2:41:48.320]  regular person thinks you make money by working hard inventing something writing
[2:41:48.320 --> 2:41:52.840]  something making music you know cooking good food however you make your money
[2:41:52.840 --> 2:41:56.760]  they make money by shutting your business off and and setting up theirs
[2:41:56.760 --> 2:42:00.240]  they make their money by shutting down the power plant and theirs makes double
[2:42:00.240 --> 2:42:04.280]  money they make money by making you buy their smart meter making you buy their
[2:42:04.280 --> 2:42:08.920]  Obamacare I mean it's just total mafia government how we're going to get
[2:42:08.920 --> 2:42:12.760]  control of it man I tell you they're buying billions of bullets armored

[2:43:12.200 --> 2:43:17.560]  and just resist them at every level and realize how bad they are if people knew
[2:43:17.560 --> 2:43:22.960]  how evil the system is and how it's taken over everywhere right now if people

[2:44:36.120 --> 2:44:40.560]  John in Washington you're on the air welcome
[2:44:41.160 --> 2:44:45.720]  come on down John you want to talk about citizen rule books your prison
[2:44:45.720 --> 2:44:51.440]  planet I prison planet TV viewer go ahead hey how you doing Alex yeah I
[2:44:51.440 --> 2:44:56.880]  recently got a common ticket t-shirt I've been able to afford it but not a
[2:44:56.880 --> 2:45:01.720]  work that's not good turn your guns into government they want to help you yeah
[2:45:01.720 --> 2:45:06.880]  people from over the border are taking their jobs anyway I got a citizens hand
[2:45:06.880 --> 2:45:11.280]  rule our citizens rule book in there when we got it when I got it and that
[2:45:11.280 --> 2:45:15.440]  there's been more help to me than anything and I would like to get them
[2:45:15.440 --> 2:45:21.520]  into the hands of people but because I'm not working I can't afford to buy a
[2:45:21.520 --> 2:45:26.000]  stack of them I was wondering if there's a way that you can give me a stack of
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:31.360]  them so here's the deal I already sell the citizen rule books at cost I mean I
[2:45:31.360 --> 2:45:35.720]  sell them and I put them in things free and sometimes I thought about canceling
[2:45:35.720 --> 2:45:42.840]  because it's gotten so expensive the magazine's put out at cost and you know
[2:45:42.840 --> 2:45:45.760]  it's it's been interesting it's turned out really good but it's also been a
[2:45:45.760 --> 2:45:48.640]  nightmare at some levels because I've got all these other projects I need to
[2:45:48.640 --> 2:45:54.880]  launch but I mean I you understand that if I start giving citizen rule books out
[2:45:54.880 --> 2:45:58.840]  I'll go bankrupt because here's the deal I offered a hundred and fifty thousand
[2:45:58.840 --> 2:46:03.280]  stickers out quietly at night and didn't didn't even promote it put it on the
[2:46:03.280 --> 2:46:07.320]  website the next day I plugged it once three thousand people emailed requesting
[2:46:07.320 --> 2:46:11.800]  the fifty free bumper stickers okay in less than a day that evening and then
[2:46:11.800 --> 2:46:16.120]  into the show and that was with shipping and the bumper stickers I think well
[2:46:16.120 --> 2:46:20.640]  then said about thirty four thousand dollars but but we're doing it as a
[2:46:20.640 --> 2:46:27.280]  test because our missions get the word out so I mean it is important to hand
[2:46:27.280 --> 2:46:30.720]  them out but most people think it's terrorist document have you ever seen
[2:46:30.720 --> 2:46:33.320]  the road to tyranny where the state police have a warrantless checkpoint in
[2:46:33.320 --> 2:46:37.080]  Virginia and they pull over a Navy veteran no criminal record my point is
[2:46:37.080 --> 2:46:41.480]  just canning equipment in the back of the car that's why she gone to town they
[2:46:41.480 --> 2:46:44.800]  thought that was very suspicious and it's the squad car video and they find
[2:46:44.800 --> 2:46:49.120]  one of the same citizen rule books out of Arizona that same company and they
[2:46:49.120 --> 2:46:56.000]  start going the two state police and behind I mean it's like it's a dead

[2:56:58.280 --> 2:57:03.960]  anything about this but you know as you most likely know steel team four their
[2:57:03.960 --> 2:57:09.360]  primary objective is to guard diplomats when they're in the Middle East and I
[2:57:09.360 --> 2:57:13.800]  have a personal relationship to Commander Job Price the leader of steel
[2:57:13.800 --> 2:57:18.000]  team four and I want to know if you heard anything about his death and the
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:22.640]  supposed if you go to the European Union Times there's an amazing article on
[2:57:22.640 --> 2:57:26.440]  what real what they think really happened and there's a lot of data in
[2:57:26.440 --> 2:57:31.320]  there that he flew with four other seals the Bahrain got on a flight with
[2:57:31.320 --> 2:57:36.600]  Hillary Clinton in late December there's a reason a bunch of seals are
[2:57:36.600 --> 2:57:39.720]  dying with that source you give is not a good source from my experience but I
[2:57:39.720 --> 2:57:43.640]  appreciate your call the people you know personally send us some information I
[2:57:43.640 --> 2:57:47.360]  mean you know tell your story we'll we'll check it and vet it you got photos
[2:57:47.360 --> 2:57:51.560]  with this guy will publish it but you know they kill seals all the time
[2:57:51.560 --> 2:57:55.760]  because that's who they use as their black op commandos and of course they
[2:57:55.760 --> 2:57:58.880]  actually take them out of seals that's you always people always think it's the
[2:57:58.880 --> 2:58:04.120]  last level there's like five more levels above seals and then Delta force and
[2:58:04.120 --> 2:58:11.280]  then groups above that men associated with special forces we'll just put it to
[2:58:11.280 --> 2:58:15.080]  you that way because I've had family that have been involved in it and the
[2:58:15.080 --> 2:58:20.760]  whole thing is you're actually working for the globalist okay I love to always
[2:58:20.760 --> 2:58:23.480]  talk about that and people that say I'm a government agent never use that because
[2:58:23.480 --> 2:58:26.720]  it's my admission but it's not like it's a bad admission I'm exposing that the
[2:58:26.720 --> 2:58:30.640]  stuff is going on but then they make up intelligence community connections that
[2:58:30.640 --> 2:58:33.800]  aren't there you know it because because it's them breaking and see it's them
[2:58:33.800 --> 2:58:37.760]  making it up doesn't matter all right I'm gonna come back with more calls

[3:01:01.640 --> 3:01:06.280]  have already gotten cuckoo level dangerous it'd be like being in a ship
[3:01:06.280 --> 3:01:10.440]  that's listing over to one side about the capsize and people are still eating
[3:01:10.440 --> 3:01:16.560]  caviar and champagne or everything's great shut up conspiracy theorist and you
[3:01:16.560 --> 3:01:22.160]  know we could still fix the ship but this always happens in decadent societies
[3:01:22.160 --> 3:01:25.840]  people don't grow up under real adversity so as they go into a scientific
[3:01:25.840 --> 3:01:29.400]  adversity they don't know how to resist it and then they lie to themselves and
[3:01:29.400 --> 3:01:34.440]  acclimate themselves to any new level of abuse and it's called being a
[3:01:34.440 --> 3:01:38.680]  biological robot I mean a conscious alive person can navigate and choose their
[3:01:38.680 --> 3:01:42.360]  destiny within their own mind that they can choose who you want to be who you
[3:01:42.360 --> 3:01:47.120]  want to stand for that you can do and I just ask God I'm gonna take a few final

[3:03:39.880 --> 3:03:44.000]  warm and fiery feeling and then after that happens it transfers right up here
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:48.040]  to the cerebral cortex because your gut your heart your head I just did how it's
[3:03:48.040 --> 3:03:51.280]  worked with me and so many others and then once you get that fire in the mind

[3:04:12.000 --> 3:04:18.160]  little inspiration to you I you sound a little down I asked for God for God
[3:04:18.160 --> 3:04:23.560]  and to show me the right way and Fran pointed me in the direction of your show
[3:04:23.560 --> 3:04:27.640]  so I think God's using you he's using you as a tool well as out of control as I
[3:04:27.640 --> 3:04:32.400]  am I am that imperfect tool and so are you to ram up against the enemy and that
[3:04:32.400 --> 3:04:37.840]  is my job I know that I'm doing God's will I just I feel so honored and so
[3:04:37.840 --> 3:04:42.000]  pathetic like dirty rags I see all the mistakes I'm everything I just say God
[3:04:42.000 --> 3:04:46.320]  help me do it better but God's like you are doing what I want now attack them
[3:04:46.320 --> 3:04:56.240]  throw everything against them now now now forward more more more burning in my
[3:04:56.240 --> 3:05:19.400]  bones we'll be right back God bless you all
