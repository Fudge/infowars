[00:00.000 --> 00:16.600]  Melania Trump knows the answer to fighting with satanic neural order it is to trust in
[00:16.600 --> 00:22.640]  God all things are possible through Christ and we must realize that it's God that's going
[00:22.640 --> 00:27.680]  to lead guide and direct us but all things are possible when we put our faith in God
[00:27.680 --> 00:34.960]  and then take action we are confronted with the challenges of
[00:34.960 --> 00:41.600]  invisible enemy one that can only be defeated through unity and our nation's
[00:41.600 --> 00:48.840]  strength love and devotion to each other all through history Americans have
[00:48.840 --> 00:54.360]  unified in challenging moments and during our greatest times of need we
[00:54.360 --> 01:01.640]  always turn to prayer today I want to ask all of you to unite and pray to
[01:01.640 --> 01:07.160]  protect and give strength to those who are serving on the front lines of the
[01:07.160 --> 01:14.760]  coronavirus pandemic and provide comfort to those who have lost loved ones in
[01:14.760 --> 01:20.160]  these uncertain times I know it is hard not to gather in your places of worship
[01:20.160 --> 01:27.320]  but we must keep our faith in God and pray for the courage and knowledge that
[01:27.320 --> 01:34.040]  better days ahead of us we will soon return to work and send our children
[01:34.040 --> 01:38.760]  back to school again we will return to our places of worship
[01:38.760 --> 01:45.200]  reunite with loved ones attend sporting events and gather with friends to share
[01:45.200 --> 01:52.360]  some laughter our dear citizens through prayer and fate we will get through this
[01:52.360 --> 02:00.280]  together I am so proud of the way all of you have responded to this crisis when
[02:00.280 --> 02:07.320]  we reach out to our Lord let us remember I can do everything through him who
[02:07.320 --> 02:15.880]  gives me strength God bless you all and God bless the United States and of
[02:15.880 --> 02:22.560]  course Twitter has been blocking the spread of that video so as Facebook with
[02:22.560 --> 02:29.360]  88 days after the election Twitter Facebook all of them banned a Fox and
[02:29.360 --> 02:33.720]  Friends video the president saying children basically have immunity COVID-19
[02:33.720 --> 02:37.680]  now I have federal and state governments officially saying that it's
[02:37.680 --> 02:41.520]  totally true but even if he was wrong he has the right to say it and for a
[02:41.520 --> 02:46.040]  platform to claim that has section 230 immunity and isn't a publisher that it's
[02:46.040 --> 02:51.000]  their job to stop something that isn't true a is unconstitutional be is
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.520]  extremely dangerous and then once they don't let you see the video they can
[02:54.520 --> 02:59.400]  lie about it with impunity meanwhile they let communist China engage in
[02:59.400 --> 03:03.680]  whatever this information they want they say that's all a okay and the
[03:03.680 --> 03:07.520]  Democrats call it the American virus the Trump virus that's a total lie but
[03:07.520 --> 03:12.280]  that's okay so it gives them impunity to lie on the modern communication systems
[03:12.280 --> 03:17.560]  that most people use most people don't use landlines don't use cell phones they
[03:17.560 --> 03:20.880]  use interfaces to the internet through phones through computers to talk over
[03:20.880 --> 03:25.360]  web messengers and other systems and now Facebook admits they are censoring my
[03:25.360 --> 03:31.560]  links president Trump's links in the messenger app something CNN called for
[03:31.560 --> 03:36.840]  last year is now being done but what's incredible will cover when we come back
[03:36.840 --> 03:41.120]  so tell everybody you know tune in I have from the federal government I have
[03:41.120 --> 03:46.920]  from state governments all right here the actual graphs of zero deaths of
[03:46.920 --> 03:52.000]  children from COVID-19 and we now have the British government coming out and
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.760]  saying they put out fake numbers in the death toll and they are going to massively
[03:55.760 --> 03:59.800]  reduce it that's because the fraud is being discovered but the fraud when it
[03:59.800 --> 04:04.240]  comes out gets blocked on the modern telecommunications systems of Google
[04:04.240 --> 04:11.320]  Facebook Twitter Apple and other systems in fact if you tick-tock we've done
[04:11.320 --> 04:14.720]  videos on tick-tock they will censor things exposing where COVID really came
[04:14.720 --> 04:18.840]  from or exposing that it's a disease of people that have vitamin deficiency as
[04:18.840 --> 04:24.840]  the NIH website even admits we've had video censored of NIH website saying if
[04:24.840 --> 04:28.760]  you don't have zinc you will die of a viral infection because viruses cannot
[04:28.760 --> 04:34.080]  replicate inside zinc inside the mitochondria it's all just facts but
[04:34.080 --> 04:38.120]  they go oh we trust in science we trust in Fauci who's lied at every point of
[04:38.120 --> 04:42.240]  the compass and then through the opening pitches you know and it went 50 feet in
[04:42.240 --> 04:46.960]  the left field an archetype of the total fraud but if you say he didn't hit the
[04:46.960 --> 04:51.000]  mound hit the pitcher you'd say his throw wasn't perfect they'll ban that too
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.280]  because Fauci is Bill Gates's minion the right but I'd stay with us
[04:58.240 --> 05:06.600]  Vicky Gibbs 57 year old lesbian preacher in Houston went in with a cough
[05:06.600 --> 05:13.400]  got intubated and then died and as soon as I saw her face as soon as I saw the
[05:13.400 --> 05:17.520]  report I said watch it'll be innovation you know what's gonna happen it's a
[05:17.520 --> 05:23.360]  blue city the same story yet again and they say her heart gave out if you put
[05:23.360 --> 05:27.760]  somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19 is a death sentence it's on record
[05:27.760 --> 05:30.720]  when everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed why are
[05:30.720 --> 05:34.680]  almost all the deaths happening in blue cities in blue states it's because they
[05:34.680 --> 05:39.480]  intubate them putting a tube in their lungs and COVID-19 is causing an auto
[05:39.480 --> 05:43.920]  immune response and if you do that with oxygen the doctors are on record saying
[05:43.920 --> 05:49.320]  it will kill you but all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow
[05:49.320 --> 05:53.640]  their orders and the minute I saw this report today I knew what I would be
[05:53.640 --> 06:14.480]  reading don't end up like Vicky Gibbs or everyone 88 days until the most
[06:14.480 --> 06:19.360]  important election in world history a referendum nationalism and a pro-human
[06:19.360 --> 06:24.400]  future or a globalist technocracy post-human nightmare I am your host
[06:24.400 --> 06:28.160]  Alex Jones very very honored to be here very very thankful to be here on this
[06:28.160 --> 06:33.640]  August 6th Thursday worldwide transmission we will be opening the
[06:33.640 --> 06:38.560]  phones up yet again today we will be taking your calls
[06:38.560 --> 06:43.000]  Darrell Rundis one of my old friends who I haven't seen in many years is gonna be
[06:43.000 --> 06:51.360]  in studio and then Matt Bracken is gonna be hosting the fourth hour the news is
[06:51.360 --> 06:58.120]  so incredible so important so over the top that I must cover all of it today I
[06:58.120 --> 07:02.920]  must get to every single scrap of this info but it's overwhelming we have
[07:02.920 --> 07:08.880]  Leticia James the woman under Cuomo that ordered and threatened to arrest nursing
[07:08.880 --> 07:16.600]  home owners operators and managers if they did not take COVID-19 positive
[07:16.600 --> 07:23.360]  patients who had other things like pneumonia and fluke this monstrous
[07:23.360 --> 07:30.880]  woman sent more than 10,000 people to their deaths she is now suing the NRA
[07:30.880 --> 07:37.120]  and vowed to quote shut it down there's are gonna claim that Wayne LaPierre had
[07:37.120 --> 07:41.400]  dinner events paid for by the NRA at his house or that flew on private jets paid
[07:41.400 --> 07:49.120]  for by the NRA to events when the Democrats and this whole criminal group
[07:49.120 --> 07:53.680]  and media matters and the rest of them get billions from Soros and live like
[07:53.680 --> 07:59.080]  kings and fly around on private jets everywhere and completely violate the
[07:59.080 --> 08:03.560]  law but imagine this woman upwards of half the deaths in New York now she
[08:03.560 --> 08:07.080]  won't even release the latest numbers are dead people they wouldn't let their
[08:07.080 --> 08:11.240]  families see their families so they could quietly kill them when they got
[08:11.240 --> 08:16.360]  $52,000 in change for every person they said had COVID every person they
[08:16.360 --> 08:26.320]  intubated Leticia James needs to be indicted but now she will throw the
[08:26.320 --> 08:30.920]  power of New York where the NRA has been chartered since after the Civil War
[08:30.920 --> 08:34.800]  because Northerners were not growing up with rifles anymore they got slaughtered
[08:34.800 --> 08:40.040]  by the South the NRA was started to train Northerners how to shoot and to arm
[08:40.040 --> 08:44.520]  and train black people on how to defend themselves in the north and the south
[08:44.520 --> 08:48.920]  talk about an original civil rights organization without the NRA the second
[08:48.920 --> 08:54.240]  amendment would be gone now Leticia James has made this move guys call Ted
[08:54.240 --> 08:56.400]  Nude to try to get him on the day or tomorrow I'm just tell him I'm going to
[08:56.400 --> 09:00.880]  pop in for three segments we can thank you he's on the NRA board so we've got
[09:00.880 --> 09:06.120]  that press conference that just ended her babbling just into their asking
[09:06.120 --> 09:13.560]  questions right now we're gonna play the nightmare intro of that and since she
[09:13.560 --> 09:16.960]  began to investigate the NRA along with the Justice Department they backed off
[09:16.960 --> 09:20.920]  all their offensive pro America stuff and have become a gelded group shutting
[09:20.920 --> 09:25.720]  down their news division but that's what they do that's why the same globalists
[09:25.720 --> 09:29.740]  including Leticia James are coming after us publicly and privately not
[09:29.740 --> 09:35.120]  liberty get to it yet and are wanting to shut us down everyone that speaks the
[09:35.120 --> 09:38.920]  truth must be shut down that's why when you tell people about the broadcast when
[09:38.920 --> 09:42.360]  you send it out in your email or your instant messenger or on Twitter or on
[09:42.360 --> 09:48.520]  Facebook or word of mouth our articles our videos our reports the live feed it
[09:48.520 --> 09:52.560]  changes the world you need to use the first amendment to defend the second
[09:52.560 --> 10:00.600]  amendment all right let me get into our top story first
[10:00.800 --> 10:05.680]  president Trump must take action now Congress must take action there's
[10:05.680 --> 10:10.440]  massive election meddling going on by big tech the heads of big tech have been
[10:10.440 --> 10:13.920]  caught by Veritas their managers have been caught their own internal
[10:13.920 --> 10:17.840]  documents have come out they've lied to Congress they aid in that communist China
[10:17.840 --> 10:22.160]  suppressing their own people and now because Trump's done nothing a month
[10:22.160 --> 10:25.400]  ago they censored one of his tweets now they're blocking his tweets now they're
[10:25.400 --> 10:31.160]  freezing his accounts and sub accounts and while they do it they said the
[10:31.160 --> 10:35.680]  president is a liar the president isn't telling the truth now if he was wrong
[10:35.680 --> 10:40.520]  it's up to us to judge what he says he's a citizen he's a public figure he's the
[10:40.520 --> 10:44.160]  president of the country we have a right not to have big tech get in the way he
[10:44.160 --> 10:49.760]  goes on Fox and friends it says basically children have immunity to COVID-19
[10:49.760 --> 10:54.240]  they can't get it they can't die from it now that's a totally true statement I'm
[10:54.240 --> 10:58.160]  gonna show you the proof in a moment this is like hydroxychloroquine in more
[10:58.160 --> 11:01.640]  than a hundred studies with with viral diseases has almost a hundred percent
[11:01.640 --> 11:05.680]  success rate with zinc if you don't have zinc it'll make you have hallucinations
[11:05.680 --> 11:10.640]  because it'll push other things into the cells because zinc isn't there and the
[11:10.640 --> 11:15.240]  doctors are all tell you that these are facts but they don't want you to have
[11:15.240 --> 11:19.920]  any hope they want you to shut down and accept what CNN has now called for
[11:19.920 --> 11:26.760]  permanent mask like seat belts to leave your home forever there's some doctors
[11:26.760 --> 11:30.440]  now saying sissarians it should be mandatory no more vaginal birth this
[11:30.440 --> 11:35.120]  is the takeover by big tech and big pharma of the life cycle of humans but
[11:35.120 --> 11:40.600]  let's get back to it unreal Twitter suspends Trump campaign account we're
[11:40.600 --> 11:45.680]  saying children almost immune from COVID-19 but they're right more kids
[11:45.680 --> 11:48.600]  die from drowning and car accidents well it turns out no children have died
[11:48.600 --> 11:52.200]  from COVID-19 they died from car accidents they died from cancer they
[11:52.200 --> 11:55.360]  died from other things and then they just test them and have a false positive
[11:55.360 --> 11:57.960]  and say they did this from the Massachusetts Department of Public
[11:57.960 --> 12:03.640]  Safety COVID-19 dashboard Monday August 3rd 2020 the last time we got a
[12:03.640 --> 12:13.520]  screenshot of it deaths by age group 0 to 19 in Massachusetts 0 0 0 0 0 0 you
[12:13.520 --> 12:23.560]  see that 0 0 deaths 0 to 19 20 to 29 17 deaths 30 to 39 35 deaths 91 deaths 40
[12:23.560 --> 12:35.920]  49 314 50 59 890 60 to 69 and it goes up to 80 plus 5,422 more than all the
[12:35.920 --> 12:42.040]  other deaths combined by double or triple excuse me so there's the reality
[12:42.040 --> 12:45.400]  we've got more of that and remember most of the people that they say they're
[12:45.400 --> 12:50.080]  younger dying it's car wrecks it's gunshot wounds and they admit that let
[12:50.080 --> 12:56.800]  me give you another little little caviar caveat this is up on info wars.com the
[12:56.800 --> 13:00.640]  National Health Service of England to decrease COVID-19 death toll after
[13:00.640 --> 13:05.760]  counting mishap they claim it's a mistake that they're going to cut it
[13:05.760 --> 13:11.720]  massively from the 49,000 that they had said to an incredibly low number and
[13:11.720 --> 13:16.960]  most of that is fraud that is all coming up but let's actually hear what the
[13:16.960 --> 13:22.240]  president had to say before I show you a stack of government CDC documents and
[13:22.240 --> 13:26.120]  mainstream news articles admitting why did children not die why do they not
[13:26.120 --> 13:30.320]  even really get sick because even if they're malnourished their cells are
[13:30.320 --> 13:34.760]  better their mitochondria are better at operating with less zinc but if you're
[13:34.760 --> 13:38.280]  old you need more of things you don't absorb it as much everyone knows that
[13:38.280 --> 13:42.400]  as you get older you need more of your essential nutrients when you hear in a
[13:42.400 --> 13:47.440]  cereal ad it's fortified with essential nutrients you know it's crap cereal
[13:47.440 --> 13:51.400]  sugar cereal but they add vitamins so you can live off that crap if you needed
[13:51.400 --> 13:56.680]  to essential means essential here's what they're censoring we've posted the
[13:56.680 --> 14:01.800]  censored video of President Trump on Fox News demand on video here it is school
[14:01.800 --> 14:06.520]  should be open if you look at children children are almost and I would almost
[14:06.520 --> 14:11.920]  say definitely but almost immune from this disease so few it's they've got
[14:11.920 --> 14:16.080]  stronger hard to believe and I don't know how you feel about it but they have
[14:16.080 --> 14:21.360]  much stronger immune systems than we do somehow for this and they do it they
[14:21.360 --> 14:25.680]  they don't have a problem they just don't have a problem I mean literally in
[14:25.680 --> 14:30.720]  New Jersey where you had thousands many thousands of death the governor Phil
[14:30.720 --> 14:35.600]  Murphy told me good guy too by the way but he told me thousands and thousands
[14:35.600 --> 14:41.040]  of deaths it was hard hit there was only one person under the age of 18 who died
[14:41.040 --> 14:46.440]  of this and I think that person also had diabetes a young person it doesn't and
[14:46.440 --> 14:50.480]  especially when you get younger than that it doesn't have an impact on them and
[14:50.480 --> 14:53.240]  I've watched some doctors say they're totally immune I don't know why I hate
[14:53.240 --> 14:57.760]  to use the word totally because the news will say oh he made the word totally
[14:57.760 --> 15:01.640]  and he shouldn't have used that word but the fact is that they are virtually
[15:01.640 --> 15:08.520]  immune from this problem and I've got all the mainline news all the CDC
[15:08.520 --> 15:12.440]  articles right here and they even admit it's really an inflammatory disease they
[15:12.440 --> 15:16.840]  know that aerosolized steroids knocks out a 100% of it if your lungs aren't
[15:16.840 --> 15:23.040]  already ruined if they get to on time 100% a few puffs of that within hours
[15:23.040 --> 15:26.920]  you're fine you do it a few days it's gone and the doctors go public
[15:26.920 --> 15:31.440]  prestigious doctors and they get called up for reprimand they get fired they get
[15:31.440 --> 15:35.320]  censored because these murdering criminals like Leticia James that ordered
[15:35.320 --> 15:38.680]  up the nursing homes to take people that were sick into them knowing it'd be a
[15:38.680 --> 15:42.640]  death rate they needed the murder rate these are people trying to murder our
[15:42.640 --> 15:47.040]  second amendment trying to murder our speech they're a criminal takeover their
[15:47.040 --> 15:51.200]  enemies they're funded by George Soros and it's all coming out and now they're
[15:51.200 --> 15:54.520]  backs against the wall so they're fighting for their dirty criminal
[15:54.520 --> 16:00.800]  political lives August 2020 is here it's less than 90 days out from the
[16:00.800 --> 16:05.300]  historic election the chai comms the EU Hollywood the Democratic Party in the

[16:09.920 --> 16:14.440]  to destroy free speech as well to ensure their final takeover of the United

[18:17.760 --> 18:23.320]  except for Switzerland and Israel and a few other places and now George Soros the
[18:23.320 --> 18:26.520]  Nazi collaborator wants our guns and has gotten all these attorney generals and
[18:26.520 --> 18:30.840]  district attorneys elected that say no second amendment no self-defense and

[18:35.840 --> 18:40.320]  anyone because they are the tyrants they are in control here's Leticia James just
[18:40.320 --> 18:47.120]  about 45 minutes ago pledging to destroy the NRA and the co-chief of the
[18:47.120 --> 18:55.880]  enforcement section Emily Stern just a few minutes ago my office filed a law
[18:55.880 --> 19:00.640]  suit against the National Rifle Association to dissolve the organization
[19:00.640 --> 19:07.800]  in its entirety for years of self-dealing and illegal conduct that
[19:07.800 --> 19:16.600]  violate New York's charity's law and undermine its own mission blow up the
[19:16.600 --> 19:24.480]  police stations kill the whiteies abolish the NRA oh they don't want to
[19:24.480 --> 19:28.480]  abolish the NRA oh they don't want our guns oh that's a conspiracy theory and
[19:28.480 --> 19:35.200]  now they're making their move and now oh Van Alex Jones a speech so they can
[19:35.200 --> 19:39.480]  then lie about me however they want that same woman says that I'm a criminal and
[19:39.480 --> 19:44.800]  that I said I had a COVID-19 cure said no such thing let's see what she says it
[19:44.800 --> 19:49.760]  in the left says oh Jones is saying that's getting
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.440]  she's the one that sent all the people to the nursing homes ordered them if the
[19:53.440 --> 19:57.400]  doctors run those are like this will kill people you can't send sick patients
[19:57.400 --> 20:01.400]  that have pneumonia's and the flu that you say or COVID-19 into these it'll
[20:01.400 --> 20:06.000]  kill them and they said you'll be arrested if you don't she was all
[20:06.000 --> 20:11.280]  maniacal about it remember over 10,000 dead now they're keeping the new death
[20:11.280 --> 20:16.640]  secret too and she's up there doubling down and saying hey I'm gonna kill old
[20:16.640 --> 20:21.240]  people and I'm gonna take your guns and I'm gonna kill you because she's a dirty
[20:21.240 --> 20:25.400]  monster communist with a big fat chip on her shoulder and she hates this
[20:25.400 --> 20:32.080]  country but I just showed you the Massachusetts numbers right here on
[20:32.080 --> 20:37.560]  their own state website zero deaths of children zero deaths of people zero to
[20:37.560 --> 20:43.200]  19 years of age zero in every case when you hear about some oh a two-year-old
[20:43.200 --> 20:46.480]  died turns out the two-year-old been in a car wreck and they said they tested
[20:46.480 --> 20:50.160]  positive or the two-year-old had cancer and again why do all these kids have
[20:50.160 --> 20:59.960]  cancer now but they say our president is a liar but I'll tell you what is going
[20:59.960 --> 21:06.600]  on study coronavirus restrictions killing 10,000 children per month and
[21:06.600 --> 21:12.360]  wasting and stunting millions more that's conservative numbers starving to
[21:12.360 --> 21:18.760]  death because of it but that's okay because Leticia James is black so she
[21:18.760 --> 21:22.400]  can do whatever she wants but that's why Soros the Nazi collaborator hired her
[21:22.400 --> 21:26.720]  that's why Nike and that's why Apple gives money to Black Lives Matter to say
[21:26.720 --> 21:30.360]  that they represent black people so hey Leticia James is allowed to get rid of
[21:30.360 --> 21:35.320]  your second amendment she's black oh and Apple's allowed to run slave factories
[21:35.320 --> 21:39.800]  in China that three million Muslims and death camps because well Tim Cook gave
[21:39.800 --> 21:43.880]  money to the black people did not by the black people they've raised 50 something
[21:43.880 --> 21:47.160]  million dollars last time I checked for Black Lives Matter that all went to the
[21:47.160 --> 21:52.600]  Democratic Party and a bunch of old crazy white people
[21:54.400 --> 22:01.800]  meanwhile Trump runs an ad showing Joe Biden and we saw his own photos he put
[22:01.800 --> 22:06.760]  out where they had everybody's social distancing and there's like only five
[22:06.760 --> 22:10.200]  people in the room that's what they put out and Trump showed that they went oh
[22:10.200 --> 22:13.680]  that's misleading he's had bigger rallies than that Joe Biden's been hiding
[22:13.680 --> 22:22.200]  for six months Joe Biden won't do TV interviews with anybody basically oh but
[22:22.200 --> 22:30.720]  it's fake news that Trump showed this photo in an ad and said hardly anybody
[22:30.720 --> 22:36.880]  was there even it was fake then you see it you learn Trump's a liar but it
[22:36.880 --> 22:41.960]  wasn't Trump was right about no children dying of COVID-19 basically being
[22:41.960 --> 22:46.960]  immune from dying from it and he was right that Biden won't ever come out in
[22:46.960 --> 22:50.160]  public except for two or three little photo ops and when he does you don't
[22:50.160 --> 22:57.560]  know who he is and the gaffes daily he said black people all think the same
[22:57.560 --> 23:01.960]  with some notable exceptions well yeah the Democratic Party thinks they all do
[23:01.960 --> 23:08.080]  and they they think they own you but they think they own us all
[23:08.080 --> 23:13.560]  Black Lives Matter is the least black thing in America it comes out of George
[23:13.560 --> 23:18.040]  Soros's think tanks who's not even an American he's a dude that rounded up his
[23:18.040 --> 23:22.560]  fellow Jews and sent them off to death camps and said it was the happiest time
[23:22.560 --> 23:27.720]  in his life and that it was exhilarating he called it happy making time don't
[23:27.720 --> 23:33.480]  need to play the clips and you know if you said that on Fox News they didn't
[23:33.480 --> 23:36.440]  care who you were judicial watch you name it you get banned newt Gendrich came
[23:36.440 --> 23:41.320]  out on Fox News and said it he said Soros is behind Leticia James all these
[23:41.320 --> 23:50.720]  DA's all these crazy people lightfoot all of it and again why is it all black
[23:50.720 --> 23:57.520]  women that Soros is running because then you can't attack them it's like Oprah
[23:57.520 --> 24:01.720]  Winfrey goes to secret eugenics meetings to discuss depopulating Africa
[24:01.720 --> 24:05.200]  that's a London Guardian headline ten years ago back when they weren't totally
[24:05.200 --> 24:10.840]  evil even ABC News reported on it she goes to meetings to decide how she can be
[24:10.840 --> 24:18.080]  the front person with her foundation under Bill Gates and Bloomberg and Ted
[24:18.080 --> 24:23.600]  Turner to depopulate Africa and then she's on TV with her billions of
[24:23.600 --> 24:28.640]  dollars telling us America sucks and white people are inherently evil remember
[24:28.640 --> 24:35.200]  that by the way if you're a radio listener they're putting on screen the
[24:35.200 --> 24:39.680]  Wall Street Journal the London Guardian all of it just type in Bill Gates wants
[24:39.680 --> 24:44.680]  to depopulate Africa you'll get his own words so let me explain how this works you
[24:44.680 --> 24:49.200]  see she works for people that are really evil and do want to kill you if you're
[24:49.200 --> 24:53.440]  black I'm not gonna sit here if you're black full of hate to court me because
[24:53.440 --> 24:57.120]  you're brainwashed by these people and kiss your ass I'm gonna tell you wake
[24:57.120 --> 25:05.360]  the hell up everybody that we are all under attack by this and it's crazy
[25:05.360 --> 25:09.440]  we're gonna go to break here in a few minutes when I come back wait till you
[25:09.440 --> 25:22.640]  hear this wait till you hear this they're now shutting off the electricity
[25:22.640 --> 25:25.680]  and water at people's houses when the neighbors call and say they had a small
[25:25.680 --> 25:31.480]  party in the backyard in Los Angeles and it gets worse I read this I was trying
[25:31.480 --> 25:35.800]  to go to bed early last night I read this at about 10 o'clock in bed and I got
[25:35.800 --> 25:40.440]  really angry and had trouble sleeping for about an hour because I knew when I
[25:40.440 --> 25:44.880]  saw the headline what it was gonna say and I read it CNN and others I thought
[25:44.880 --> 25:47.680]  oh god this is a new PR rollout so as soon as I read the article I search
[25:47.680 --> 25:51.400]  engine the terms and I saw hundreds of articles this week that I hadn't even
[25:51.400 --> 25:59.320]  come across where they are now saying that we will wear mask permanently
[25:59.320 --> 26:05.520]  outside and in our homes and robot computers the home assistants and all
[26:05.520 --> 26:09.600]  that will be mandatory and they're gonna watch you and make you wear a mask and
[26:09.600 --> 26:14.680]  breathe carbon dioxide I mean think of them a cult movie made in the 90s or
[26:14.680 --> 26:18.040]  something where in the future you wear masks to go outside because you're scared
[26:18.040 --> 26:22.800]  of viruses that doesn't even really exist and it's all total mental illness
[26:22.800 --> 26:26.240]  and yeah they've announced robots are watching you to make you wear the mask I
[26:26.240 --> 26:33.160]  mean this is all over the news now this is a total dystopic takeover and gates in
[26:33.160 --> 26:38.600]  the UN run the Wuhan run China is all beta tested in China and we and Singapore
[26:38.600 --> 26:42.440]  and now we do what they say and it's total dystopia to get us ready for
[26:42.440 --> 26:46.960]  force inoculations even more but it's all here it's not coming it's here it's
[26:46.960 --> 26:52.360]  here it's here I mean we've got to stop them we got to say no never comply with
[26:52.360 --> 26:56.920]  any of it they're the enemy a lot of you are probably already very familiar with
[26:56.920 --> 27:01.160]  these terms about to introduce but some folks are so those that aren't here they
[27:01.160 --> 27:10.280]  are activated charcoal and then another term enamel safe activated charcoal is
[27:10.280 --> 27:16.320]  the fastest growing type of toothpaste for a good reason it really really works
[27:16.320 --> 27:19.800]  well we've come up with the best activated charcoal toothpaste with no
[27:19.800 --> 27:23.320]  fillers the cleanest type the highest quality with a bunch of high quality
[27:23.320 --> 27:27.800]  essential oils and other ingredients known and documented to do amazing
[27:27.800 --> 27:31.640]  things for your oral hygiene and your overall health in your mouth that's so
[27:31.640 --> 27:34.720]  critical and it makes your teeth look really white and really really clean
[27:34.720 --> 27:38.720]  and it's good for your gums but on top of that it doesn't have any ingredients
[27:38.720 --> 27:42.640]  that are known to hurt an animal I've gone up before and gotten toothpaste that
[27:42.640 --> 27:47.600]  really made my teeth clean but eroded an animal up the top so I got into really
[27:47.600 --> 27:52.280]  safe healthy types of toothpaste and that's what this is it's available at

[31:02.640 --> 31:07.160]  governor's vineyards that have restaurants and wineries on them they had
[31:07.160 --> 31:10.480]  an order on the 4th of July everybody else had to be shut down all the other
[31:10.480 --> 31:14.320]  wineries but his big chain of wineries was allowed to stay open you're like
[31:14.320 --> 31:16.840]  well that's outrageous conflict of interest that's criminal activity out
[31:16.840 --> 31:22.600]  in the open well that's how it works the NRA the Democrats are preparing
[31:22.600 --> 31:25.360]  criminal charges against them at the Justice Department Trump's not in
[31:25.360 --> 31:28.160]  control of the Justice Department Democrats are still in control of most
[31:28.160 --> 31:34.360]  the areas and I told you they're going after the NRA civilly Ted Dujan has to
[31:34.360 --> 31:36.560]  be careful because he's an NRA board member about what he can say about this
[31:36.560 --> 31:41.360]  suit but he will be joining us tomorrow to cover the waterfront we just talked
[31:41.360 --> 31:53.080]  to him. Leticia James vows to abolish the NRA abolish the NRA because they're
[31:53.080 --> 31:58.960]  saying Wayne LaPierre through event parties at his house which is it's
[31:58.960 --> 32:05.240]  their nonprofit and flew with his family at least seven times on a chartered
[32:05.240 --> 32:11.760]  plane to the Bahamas oh that's that's an organization that's been defending the
[32:11.760 --> 32:16.080]  Second Amendment now the problem is they got wimpy about 20 years ago
[32:16.080 --> 32:20.280]  Dunno's of America voters got on their tail we got on their tail that Nujit
[32:20.280 --> 32:23.800]  made them hardcore again they've done a great job the last 10 years they set up
[32:23.800 --> 32:29.320]  NRA TV it was rivaling Fox huge viewership online alone was I mean we're
[32:29.320 --> 32:32.800]  talking 10 million viewers a day they hired a lot of great consultants like
[32:32.800 --> 32:37.840]  Jesse James and others and all these other people that ended up being Fox
[32:37.840 --> 32:45.600]  News host like Dan Bongino it was huge and as soon as Leticia James went after
[32:45.600 --> 32:48.680]  them two years ago and said I'm gonna grab your nonprofit status because they've
[32:48.680 --> 32:52.360]  been based in New York since the end of the Civil War where they were there to
[32:52.360 --> 32:54.880]  teach Northerners how to shoot because the Northerners got their clock clean
[32:54.880 --> 32:58.480]  because they did not use a gun they had basic training but what if we got
[32:58.480 --> 33:01.080]  Southerners that were cooking and going out and shooting dinner every night for
[33:01.080 --> 33:04.240]  mama they got their ass handed to them even though they had five times the
[33:04.240 --> 33:11.000]  troops and way more times the ammunition and weapons only one ammo factory in all
[33:11.000 --> 33:18.000]  the south but long story short it was set up for that and for blacks to be
[33:18.000 --> 33:22.560]  able to have guns literally it's charter and that's why they come out and have
[33:22.560 --> 33:27.200]  the left go the new KKK is the NRA it's like saying Martin Luther King is the
[33:27.200 --> 33:30.960]  KKK it's just total fraud ladies and gentlemen but people that don't know
[33:30.960 --> 33:37.200]  history are doomed to repeat it so they shut down the production they got rid of
[33:37.200 --> 33:44.440]  all the great posts they had and they thought oh that'll make them leave us
[33:44.440 --> 33:50.080]  alone going after our tax exemption so like what are you doing having TV shows
[33:50.080 --> 33:53.840]  advocating second amendment that's political of course it is and you've
[33:53.840 --> 33:56.720]  got all these tax exempt Democrat groups to do whatever they want to say
[33:56.720 --> 34:00.480]  abolish the police abolish the border abolish the country oh but that's not
[34:00.480 --> 34:05.960]  political 20 Congress to act the NRA act and I told the NRA at the time and I
[34:05.960 --> 34:09.840]  told some of their board members I said you need to go after the criminal
[34:09.840 --> 34:14.080]  activity of the New York mafia you need to move in the NRA out of New York you
[34:14.080 --> 34:17.120]  need to go on the offense you do not need to put your tail between your legs
[34:17.120 --> 34:23.440]  and do this and they agreed with me but not the majority of the board well they
[34:23.440 --> 34:34.400]  shut down their incredibly successful TV network and now James after they shut
[34:34.400 --> 34:37.880]  everything down after their power has waned now they're gonna try to shut them
[34:37.880 --> 34:42.720]  down this is up complete absolutely totally and completely we're gonna get to
[34:42.720 --> 34:47.880]  that next segment but here's the LA mayor threatens to shut off power and
[34:47.880 --> 34:52.840]  water to homes that host parties that this is the criminal evil all based on

[36:07.040 --> 36:12.600]  virtuous sailors imagine you're this lady she's what's wrong with you people who

[36:30.040 --> 36:35.000]  business everybody knows what you people mean means you but see you're not a you
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.440]  anymore you're not an individual what you did it's about a group and people hide
[36:38.440 --> 36:42.840]  behind that but it's not empowering you being an individual empowers you for what
[36:42.840 --> 36:46.480]  you stand for I'm going off the rails here this is just insane so here's this
[36:46.480 --> 36:51.840]  monster mayor and whatever LA does it's the UN model and all of this is
[36:51.840 --> 36:56.960]  directed by the UN every part of covid's a fraud but still they double down and
[36:56.960 --> 37:00.800]  keep things locked down to kill this economy consolidate power you say
[37:00.800 --> 37:03.200]  everybody's leaving California it's falling apart they'll just take the
[37:03.200 --> 37:08.480]  restrictions off later five years from now then jack up prices again it's a
[37:08.480 --> 37:14.480]  seesaw it's a game it's war curious but all the sacrifices can be undone by
[37:14.480 --> 37:19.080]  those who refuse to follow the science and who refuse to follow the rules and
[37:19.080 --> 37:25.280]  put our economy and our community at risk recently we've seen the reports of
[37:25.280 --> 37:29.680]  some large parties and gatherings in flagrant violations of health orders as
[37:29.680 --> 37:34.320]  our County Department of Public Health said yesterday and I quote the highest
[37:34.320 --> 37:38.080]  risk settings are large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for
[37:38.080 --> 37:42.800]  individuals to remain spaced at least six feet apart and where face coverings
[37:42.800 --> 37:48.280]  are not worn the consequences of these large parties ripple far beyond just
[37:48.280 --> 37:52.360]  those parties they ripple throughout our entire community because the virus can
[37:52.360 --> 37:58.040]  quickly and easily spread while we have already closed all nightclubs and bars
[37:58.040 --> 38:02.200]  these large house parties have essentially become nightclubs in the
[38:02.200 --> 38:07.760]  hills many times the homes are vacant or used for short-term rentals and beyond
[38:07.760 --> 38:13.480]  the noise the traffic and nuisance these large parties are unsafe and can cost
[38:13.480 --> 38:19.160]  Angelenos their lives that is why tonight I am authorizing the city to shut
[38:19.160 --> 38:24.000]  off Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Service in the egregious cases in
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.880]  which houses businesses and other venues are hosting unpermitted large
[38:28.880 --> 38:32.840]  gatherings they have a name for this it's called siege now you notice he's
[38:32.840 --> 38:37.920]  reading off a iPad remember what Gateway Pundit reported on Monday federal
[38:37.920 --> 38:43.640]  government testing how to brainwash the public at major universities with 15
[38:43.640 --> 38:48.080]  data points about a shame and anger and use other people being mean to you to

[43:07.120 --> 43:12.440]  only ramping up the testing because the test have been designed at the Wuhan lab
[43:12.440 --> 43:17.080]  it turns out to be completely fraudulent they cook the whole thing up

[44:53.440 --> 44:58.120]  third hour today and then Matt Bracken will take over in the fourth hour former
[44:58.120 --> 45:01.880]  Navy syllabus selling author researcher great guy very informative about the
[45:01.880 --> 45:05.680]  attempt to take over the US and what he expects to have unfold here in the next
[45:05.680 --> 45:11.920]  88 days now let me tell you what's coming up here in just a moment LA mayor
[45:11.920 --> 45:17.120]  threatens to shut off power and water to homes that host parties the debate over
[45:17.120 --> 45:23.160]  mass today is a lot like the fight to mandate seatbelts and CNN says you will
[45:23.160 --> 45:27.920]  wear one at all times like a seatbelt I mean you talk about a cult man and all
[45:27.920 --> 45:31.080]  the health problems the insanity and humans for all of our development see
[45:31.080 --> 45:34.960]  each other's faces and just what this does psychologically this is so damn
[45:34.960 --> 45:39.080]  evil it comes out of the mad scientist that brought you who will hon lamb
[45:39.080 --> 45:44.720]  everything the good news is only 44% say they will submit to the coronavirus
[45:44.720 --> 45:48.240]  vaccine that stories up on info wars dot com from Gallup and you know under
[45:48.240 --> 45:51.680]  peer pressure a lot of people are gonna say I'll I'll submit when they're not
[45:51.680 --> 45:56.840]  studies show that so I'd say off this number maybe 15% are actually gonna take
[45:56.840 --> 46:03.560]  it but they actually say in this article from CNN they go well they said
[46:03.560 --> 46:07.640]  we'll end up forcing you and we'll make you evolve to submit that humans will
[46:07.640 --> 46:14.320]  always wear masks now and what does my son to do they make every major crop
[46:14.320 --> 46:17.800]  artificial so it doesn't produce seeds that produce seeds again it'll grow
[46:17.800 --> 46:22.720]  crops they take control the life cycle that is the end game they have told you
[46:22.720 --> 46:29.000]  that is the end game we'll be covering all this and more in a moment but I have
[46:29.000 --> 46:34.040]  a very exciting announcement to make before there was even info wars life
[46:34.040 --> 46:39.040]  nine years ago the first product that we private labeled and put out was a very
[46:39.040 --> 46:43.800]  high quality concentrated liquid turmeric so that's absorbed under the tongue
[46:43.800 --> 46:48.440]  because some people don't absorb as much of it in the gut and then we were
[46:48.440 --> 46:52.000]  unable to get more from that supplier and have never had a liquid turmeric
[46:52.000 --> 46:57.800]  formula now the one we have over two years of time and work to get it
[46:57.800 --> 47:02.200]  consumer it's so precious when it's the super high-end type we now have it
[47:02.200 --> 47:08.080]  ladies and gentlemen and it is pure turmeric extract taken under the tongue
[47:08.080 --> 47:15.280]  extremely strong it doesn't compete with bodies bodies is a turmeric extract
[47:15.280 --> 47:20.520]  concentrate curcuminoid at 95% leading competitors on average are three to
[47:20.520 --> 47:27.200]  5% it's amazing people love it and so this complements the new liquid turmeric
[47:27.200 --> 47:31.640]  they go together but it's different strokes for different folks a lot of the
[47:31.640 --> 47:35.280]  crews been using this in the last few months which has been in but the you know
[47:35.280 --> 47:38.240]  the testers the official stuff got in a few weeks ago but I've been so busy I
[47:38.240 --> 47:42.680]  haven't launched this yet now I am and some of the crew likes this better than
[47:42.680 --> 47:47.560]  bodies my wife can't tell that she's taking both of them but it she's like
[47:47.560 --> 47:51.360]  again why does this turmeric pill I'm taking from somebody else say it has
[47:51.360 --> 47:56.400]  twice the tumor but doesn't work as well because it's not a curcuminoid
[47:56.400 --> 48:01.640]  concentrate where they isolate the curcuminoid and then concentrated this
[48:01.640 --> 48:07.000]  is concentrated turmeric taken under the tongue and then you swallow the rest of
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.200]  it different strokes for different folks people want a liquid turmeric this is
[48:11.200 --> 48:15.640]  the best we can find and bring you and it took a long time to get it get it
[48:15.640 --> 48:19.920]  certified and get it out to you so we have a limited run of this out of the
[48:19.920 --> 48:24.920]  gates is 25% off info or store.com or call toll free triple eight two five
[48:24.920 --> 48:29.520]  three three one three nine and the money that comes in off of this funds us
[48:29.520 --> 48:33.720]  when we're going up against the very same people like Leticia James and the
[48:33.720 --> 48:36.400]  Democrats and the globalists and all the things are trying to do to us ladies
[48:36.400 --> 48:40.040]  and gentlemen because what they do is they bite into you and then try to get
[48:40.040 --> 48:43.800]  you to serve them politically and then if you go along with them it gets even
[48:43.800 --> 48:47.520]  worse as the NRA just found out we're not we're not rolling over the new world
[48:47.520 --> 48:51.360]  order we're not shutting down our media operations so they'll leave us alone a
[48:51.360 --> 48:56.800]  because it's not the right thing to do be they lie the NRA shut itself down
[48:56.800 --> 49:01.680]  politically rolled over because the leadership didn't want to get audited
[49:01.680 --> 49:06.480]  and stuff for no big deal stuff and so now you see where they are that
[49:06.480 --> 49:11.920]  murderer Leticia James took that as weakness she is a murderer she ordered
[49:11.920 --> 49:17.260]  the hospitals to disgorge people into the nursing homes that had flues and
[49:17.260 --> 49:20.760]  pneumonia and she's so arrogant as George Soros backs her that she thinks she
[49:20.760 --> 49:24.720]  can murder all these people they get COVID numbers up and now she pledges to
[49:24.720 --> 49:33.880]  destroy the NRA we also have the new special it is for a limited time it's
[49:33.880 --> 49:36.000]  the same special we have we just had to get rid of the free shipping if we're
[49:36.000 --> 49:39.440]  not bringing enough funds with that to fund our operation the 50 to 60% off all
[49:39.440 --> 49:43.440]  the best sellers it is the reopen America back to school special whether
[49:43.440 --> 49:46.040]  it's the lung cleanse whether it's the body's ultimate tumor formula
[49:46.040 --> 49:52.620]  turbo force brain force plus x2 x3 winner son the ultimate vitamin D3 with
[49:52.620 --> 49:55.520]  vitamin K taken under the tongue amazing for immunity your overall health

[50:00.560 --> 50:04.200]  gonna find two different types together synergistically under the tongue is the
[50:04.200 --> 50:09.160]  building blocked yesterday I was super tired I was like wait a minute you've
[50:09.160 --> 50:13.600]  not been taken all the supplements so I took vitamin D3 I took the winner son I
[50:13.600 --> 50:19.120]  took the ultra 12 I took the bodies I mean I had a bunch of it last night

[50:28.480 --> 50:31.280]  some brain force or turbo force but probably a quarter packet of the brain
[50:31.280 --> 50:34.680]  force it's so strong and the other turbo force so again ladies gentlemen thank
[50:34.680 --> 50:39.960]  you all for the support because we are up against pure scientific evil here and
[50:39.960 --> 50:45.520]  imagine the new talking point is you're never taking your mask off Fauci says we
[50:45.520 --> 50:49.360]  should never shake hands again they don't want us having kids they don't want
[50:49.360 --> 50:53.160]  us dating they don't want us living they don't want us having parties it's a

[52:27.360 --> 52:30.640]  with Leticia James that sent all those people infected with disease into the
[52:30.640 --> 52:34.040]  nursing homes to get a hot death rate let's go to the doctor Joseph Mingala
[52:34.040 --> 52:39.960]  here she is swearing to disarm you to complete your journey to enslavement just
[52:39.960 --> 52:44.520]  a few minutes ago my office filed a lawsuit against the National Rifle
[52:44.520 --> 52:51.000]  Association to dissolve the organization in its entirety for years of self-dealing
[52:51.000 --> 52:59.040]  and illegal conduct that violate New York's charity's law and undermine its
[52:59.040 --> 53:06.600]  own mission the National Rifle Association or the NRA is the largest and
[53:06.600 --> 53:15.680]  most influential pro-gun organization in the nation since its founding in 1871
[53:15.680 --> 53:20.680]  the NRA has been a registered not-for-profit charitable corporation in
[53:20.680 --> 53:25.080]  the state of New York the Attorney General's office has a wide range of
[53:25.080 --> 53:29.320]  regulatory and enforcement powers over charitable corporations and their
[53:29.320 --> 53:37.640]  trustees including the NRA the NRA's influence has been so powerful that the
[53:37.640 --> 53:43.960]  organization went unchecked for decades while top executives funneled millions
[53:43.960 --> 53:54.640]  into their own pockets for years the NRA diverted millions and millions of
[53:54.640 --> 54:00.560]  dollars away from its charitable mission for personal use by senior
[54:00.560 --> 54:06.400]  leadership to award contracts to the financial gain of close associates and
[54:06.400 --> 54:12.560]  family and appeared to dole out lucrative no-show contracts to former
[54:12.560 --> 54:21.600]  employees in order to buy their silence and continued loyalty think about this
[54:21.600 --> 54:26.120]  this lawsuit specifically charges the NRA as a whole in addition to four
[54:26.120 --> 54:32.440]  individual defendants everything she says about them she does one the first
[54:32.440 --> 54:37.760]  individual longtime executive vice president Wayne Lapierre who has been
[54:37.760 --> 54:45.680]  the face of the NRA for decades the reasons that the globalist launch this
[54:45.680 --> 54:50.400]  planetary lockdown the number one reason is it serves every one of their
[54:50.400 --> 54:56.720]  purposes we've gone over those purposes many times here on air the cashless
[54:56.720 --> 55:00.480]  society the surveillance system global government medical tyranny forced
[55:00.480 --> 55:06.560]  inoculation the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete that
[55:06.560 --> 55:12.800]  we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and
[55:12.800 --> 55:19.160]  robots take over the jobs that people once had by design this isn't like it's
[55:19.160 --> 55:25.320]  some advancement that we just fell into it's been preplanned organized globally
[55:25.320 --> 55:30.160]  and it's extremely predatory and through governmental actuaries and tax
[55:30.160 --> 55:35.520]  programs and regulations the central banks that control it all are able to
[55:35.520 --> 55:40.680]  pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power this is the truest
[55:40.680 --> 55:47.360]  form of technocracy fascism Americans have had freedom for so long and most
[55:47.360 --> 55:52.080]  Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history
[55:52.080 --> 55:56.040]  that we really have a blind spot for tyranny we don't appreciate the
[55:56.040 --> 56:00.640]  American way truth justice due process the right to self-defense private
[56:00.640 --> 56:03.840]  property because we've had it so long we just think that's how the rest of the
[56:03.840 --> 56:07.760]  world is ladies and gentlemen the Renaissance the social contract that's
[56:07.760 --> 56:11.560]  five hundred years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in
[56:11.560 --> 56:15.800]  humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the
[56:15.800 --> 56:20.120]  West invented and that's what made our modern world that's now been hijacked by
[56:20.120 --> 56:24.240]  the technocrats by the globalist who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth
[56:24.240 --> 56:29.120]  and we need to be cold and dumb down and put into subgroups that the elites
[56:29.120 --> 56:33.760]  dominate manipulate and command even lucky enough to stay alive and that's
[56:33.760 --> 56:39.600]  what COVID-19 is a global UN revolution against free humanity against your
[56:39.600 --> 56:42.720]  family against prosperity and against your future if you don't stand up and
[56:42.720 --> 56:45.800]  fight you deserve what you get
[56:46.440 --> 56:51.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[56:55.760 --> 56:59.200]  coming up I'm an over-the-phone's up at the top of the state of the planet here's
[56:59.200 --> 57:02.080]  an incredibly important report at Band-Aid video from Barry McGreen that will
[57:02.080 --> 57:04.840]  only fight the enemy and save lives if you spread it
[57:04.840 --> 57:08.520]  HCQ Nazi's take over the media
[57:08.520 --> 57:13.320]  hey have you ever noticed that whenever somebody goes up against the mainstream
[57:13.320 --> 57:18.880]  narrative or God forbid dares to challenge somebody like big pharma they
[57:18.880 --> 57:26.400]  are immediately ruthlessly persecuted by the mainstream mockingbird media ever
[57:26.400 --> 57:32.160]  notice that perfect example is the character assassination that's going on
[57:32.160 --> 57:37.600]  right now with America's frontline doctors who recently held a press
[57:37.600 --> 57:43.520]  conference to tell us all about their success stories in treating coronavirus
[57:43.520 --> 57:48.520]  patients with hydroxychloroquine this is a treatment regimen that's very simple
[57:48.520 --> 57:53.640]  and it should be in the hands of the American people the difficult aspect of
[57:53.640 --> 57:58.520]  this is that at the moment because of politics it's being blocked from doctors
[57:58.520 --> 58:02.600]  prescribing it and it's being blocked from pharmacists releasing it they've
[58:02.600 --> 58:07.800]  been empowered to overrule the doctors opinion the video is astonishing and
[58:07.800 --> 58:14.640]  it's been completely removed from the internet I mean it was seen what 17
[58:14.640 --> 58:20.760]  million times before Facebook Twitter Google and the rest threw it down the
[58:20.760 --> 58:25.800]  memory hole and completely got rid of it off the internet President Trump posted
[58:25.800 --> 58:30.200]  this video and Twitter deleted it the president retweeted the video which was
[58:30.200 --> 58:33.840]  eventually taken down by Twitter Facebook and YouTube for violating
[58:33.840 --> 58:38.840]  misinformation policies and they went even further with Don Jr. he posted it
[58:38.840 --> 58:44.360]  they deleted his video as well but they also suspended his account wow this is a
[58:44.360 --> 58:48.320]  must-watch because it seems very contrary to the narrative that they've been
[58:48.320 --> 58:52.480]  force-feeding us I mean what the hell are they so afraid of why is this video so
[58:52.480 --> 58:57.280]  dangerous they won't even debate these frontline doctors just shut it down
[58:57.280 --> 59:04.240]  shut it down no hydroxychloroquine for you think about it right now in the good
[59:04.240 --> 59:11.000]  old US of a America's frontline doctors are not allowed to participate on the
[59:11.000 --> 59:17.600]  public square that's what's going on under Trump's watch I might add and sure
[59:17.600 --> 59:22.400]  he might act like he's not very happy about it but when it comes to big tech
[59:22.400 --> 59:28.000]  censorship Donald Trump is all tweet and no action and now they're going in and
[59:28.000 --> 59:32.240]  pulling out peer-reviewed studies going back years ago about hydroxychloroquine
[59:32.240 --> 59:37.720]  and they are taking it down because they are so upset that this is challenging
[59:37.720 --> 59:40.560]  them because they want you to take a force inoculation there are many
[59:40.560 --> 59:44.160]  thousands of physicians who have been silenced from telling the American
[59:44.160 --> 59:49.040]  people the good news about the situation that we can manage the virus it's not
[59:49.040 --> 59:54.760]  good enough for big tech to simply delete these videos and silence these
[59:54.760 --> 1:00:00.200]  frontline doctors no they've got to go much further than that these doctors
[1:00:00.200 --> 1:00:07.880]  must be punished and ridiculed and made examples of for daring to go up against
[1:00:07.880 --> 1:00:15.680]  the mainstream big pharma narrative shame shame shame Dr. Stella Emanuel was
[1:00:15.680 --> 1:00:19.160]  part of a video Monday that featured a group of doctors claiming without
[1:00:19.160 --> 1:00:24.480]  evidence that there's a cure for COVID-19 Dr. Swillengold was in that video the
[1:00:24.480 --> 1:00:29.480]  banned one she was censored but more than that she was fired from her job
[1:00:29.480 --> 1:00:35.000]  Dr. Emanuel here has a large number of baseless claims Dr. Emanuel has also
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:39.080]  drawn criticism for pushing unusual conspiracy theories first they delete
[1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:43.280]  the videos and throw them down the memory hole then comes the smear
[1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:47.240]  campaigns and the character assassinations seriously who on earth
[1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:52.280]  could possibly trust a doctor like this she believes that demons and witches
[1:00:52.280 --> 1:01:00.080]  cause medical problems when they have nighttime dream sex with humans but
[1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:03.240]  just to be clear John we're not supposed to have sex with demons while we're
[1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:08.720]  asleep does she think that's bad I get lost here's the thing is you know no
[1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:15.920]  one loves a demon sperm joke more than I do demon sperm
[1:01:15.920 --> 1:01:22.760]  I've been fighting this info war for a long time I work for the most banned
[1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:27.400]  news network in the world and one thing I know for sure is you receive the most
[1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:32.480]  flak when you're over the target and trust me right now these frontline
[1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:42.400]  doctors they are directly over one big fat pharma target that's why they're
[1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:57.640]  being persecuted you can't make this stuff up a consortium of the UN WHO
[1:01:57.640 --> 1:02:02.280]  the Bill and Linda Gates Foundation the National Institutes of Health and of
[1:02:02.280 --> 1:02:06.280]  course the Clinton Global Initiative headed up by Chelsea Clinton on the
[1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:11.960]  board are in control with Apple and Google with a hidden app on all phones

[1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:20.520]  COVID but of course it's really the Chinese Communist social score rollout
[1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:26.120]  these people are sick filthy criminals and they want total control over society
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:30.480]  with the official global ID system that's why it's called the Clinton
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:35.120]  Global Initiative but you can fight back with the privacy pockets and info

[1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:14.480]  with the phones up for this hour the Dell run this is gonna be joining us in
[1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:21.880]  studio next hour the NRA is America's oldest second amendment organization it
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:25.320]  was set up after the Civil War because Northerners were growing up in cities
[1:03:25.320 --> 1:03:28.560]  didn't know how to shoot and they got really devastated by the South and it
[1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:33.840]  was also set up to train and arm a newly freed slaves on self-defense that's
[1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:39.120]  historic fact now of course the NRA got kind of soft on guns 20 something years
[1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:43.280]  ago they got hardcore again when Ted Nugent got on the board and without
[1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:48.560]  them we would have lost much the second amendment well George Soros funded
[1:03:48.560 --> 1:03:53.640]  Leticia James the same one that sent people infected with COVID-19 other
[1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:57.600]  flues and other pneumonia is to the hospitals to get around half the deaths
[1:03:57.600 --> 1:04:05.720]  in New York over 10,000 this monster has come out and announced that they're
[1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:10.240]  gonna quote abolish the NRA with a state-run civil suit because they're
[1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:15.400]  chartered there take their charter and quote give the money back that's what it
[1:04:15.400 --> 1:04:21.280]  is to the NRA members because the NRA said that it was running a deficit and
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:27.920]  she says it wasn't I don't care if Wayne Lapeyre was paid $5 million a year he
[1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:32.240]  wasn't I don't care if they were flying around the country to events on private
[1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:36.200]  jets they better be you can if you've got 10 people flying it's about the same
[1:04:36.200 --> 1:04:39.720]  price to get a little private jet that it is to fly commercial I don't care
[1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:46.160]  I care about their policy I give them money I get results if Wayne Lapeyre
[1:04:46.160 --> 1:04:54.520]  could save the second amendment America I'd give him my right arm now that's why
[1:04:54.520 --> 1:04:59.880]  they wanted out of the way they were expanding TV networks and were on cable
[1:04:59.880 --> 1:05:03.640]  and on satellite and we're getting huge views 10 million a day conservatively
[1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:11.520]  online alone with Dan Bongino and who's the attractive brunette her name
[1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:16.480]  always she has the beat commercials on Fox the point is they were getting over
[1:05:16.480 --> 1:05:24.440]  10 million views a day on there that Daniel Lash Losh that upset all of them
[1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:28.880]  and so they said we're starting this investigation to take your charter a
[1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:33.280]  year and a half ago and the NRA if they did anything wrong rolled over pissed
[1:05:33.280 --> 1:05:40.040]  themselves and terminated NRA TV terminated the huge outreach I know
[1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:43.760]  people involved with it not just Ted Nugent I I know Jesse James work he was
[1:05:43.760 --> 1:05:48.360]  doing basically for free for him and and all these other activists trying to get
[1:05:48.360 --> 1:05:52.840]  on the offense for the second amendment and the youth events and the thin the
[1:05:52.840 --> 1:05:57.040]  advertising and the marketing and everything they were doing going on the
[1:05:57.040 --> 1:06:02.560]  offense something they were encouraged to do and so they play these accounting
[1:06:02.560 --> 1:06:06.440]  games on TV and they go they claim they were 30 million down but they needed 60
[1:06:06.440 --> 1:06:12.400]  million and all this BS I've experienced that and I'm not a tax-free deal but the
[1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:16.440]  New York Times got some of my divorce documents from like six years ago that
[1:06:16.440 --> 1:06:22.480]  went Jones brought in $25 million in 2014 and then they counted it between three
[1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:26.440]  corporations I have three times and said I brought in $70 million no we brought
[1:06:26.440 --> 1:06:33.320]  in $25 million and that was gross then we had to pay for the product the
[1:06:33.320 --> 1:06:37.640]  infrastructure the satellites the lawyers the copyrights the all of that
[1:06:37.640 --> 1:06:42.320]  and I made a couple million dollars and then I paid it in taxes and then I paid
[1:06:42.320 --> 1:06:45.480]  it out in lawsuits there's been years where I don't end up keeping any money
[1:06:45.480 --> 1:06:49.800]  you bet now I want to make more money so I'm strong so I can withstand these
[1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:54.960]  people but imagine you open up the New York Times Jones made 78 million
[1:06:54.960 --> 1:06:59.720]  dollars so I know when I watch this and they're like and then this criminal that
[1:06:59.720 --> 1:07:05.400]  sent old people to their deaths when she's up they're going they stole 67
[1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:11.080]  million dollars and they've got this and that you can't believe anything that
[1:07:11.080 --> 1:07:19.640]  comes out of their mouths nothing you can't believe any of it I wish back in
[1:07:19.640 --> 1:07:24.280]  the day when we were able to make more money that I had to put a war chest in
[1:07:24.280 --> 1:07:27.680]  and that I would have prepared for this so we're not running close to empty the
[1:07:27.680 --> 1:07:33.520]  NRA needs 10 billion dollars if it was 50 60 million they almost defeated the
[1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:39.640]  globalists give them 50 billion we're gonna lose everything if we don't start
[1:07:39.640 --> 1:07:44.120]  word of mouth and supporting people with money because I'm in a total war with
[1:07:44.120 --> 1:07:48.560]  the exact same people and I'm not a liberty to get into at this point but I
[1:07:48.560 --> 1:07:57.120]  am not rolling over like the NRA so the NRA when they got attacked with this went
[1:07:57.120 --> 1:08:00.200]  to lawyers and said is it okay we put on parties for corporate people to come
[1:08:00.200 --> 1:08:04.560]  well yeah well we flew around on profit jets yeah but they're gonna say it's bad

[1:08:09.880 --> 1:08:14.680]  when they did that it brought that little blood thirsty anti-second amendment
[1:08:14.680 --> 1:08:20.160]  first amendment Soros monster Nazi collaborator minion that's what she is
[1:08:20.160 --> 1:08:24.760]  he's a minion of a Nazi collaborator at their throat like a vicious foaming at
[1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:29.120]  the mouth piranha here's the number to join his first-time callers on this
[1:08:29.120 --> 1:08:35.440]  subject on CNN says let's wear masks permanently California says you're

[1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:43.400]  power of Islam where you know women are enslaved by the state and there and so
[1:08:43.400 --> 1:08:46.840]  they can't be seen it's an act of power that you're bad you're dirty you're
[1:08:46.840 --> 1:08:55.920]  evil and they're not just saying make it mandatory during it a new article the
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:08:59.640]  debate over mass today is a lot like the long fight to mandate seat belts they
[1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:05.520]  say in the end we will now wear them forever and Fauci says you won't shake
[1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:10.960]  people's hands so I'm getting a cup of coffee during the break and I'm watching
[1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:15.080]  Fox News and they're literally acting they're just repeating everything
[1:09:15.080 --> 1:09:19.400]  with Lisa James says and that's why we're in so much trouble in this country
[1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:23.400]  folks we're losing everything right now here's some of Fox News breathlessly
[1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:27.400]  putting out what leticia James is up to here it is this is outnumbered over time
[1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:31.960]  I'm Harris Faulkner the New York Attorney General filed the lawsuit today
[1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:38.760]  after 18 months of investigation she says that revealed grave misconduct
[1:09:38.760 --> 1:09:43.320]  among some of the non-profits most high-profile figures including allegations
[1:09:43.320 --> 1:09:47.440]  they used the gun group to divert millions of dollars in funds for their
[1:09:47.440 --> 1:09:58.280]  personal use for these years of fraud and misconduct we are seeking an order to
[1:09:58.280 --> 1:10:05.320]  dissolve the NRA in its entirety today we send a strong and loud message that
[1:10:05.320 --> 1:10:12.920]  no one is above the law not even the NRA and the last 20 minutes we've been
[1:10:12.920 --> 1:10:16.480]  covering the breaking news on those things have heated up the NRA has come
[1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:22.360]  back with its statement and our Laura Engel is on the job Laura hi Harris well
[1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:26.880]  the New York Attorney General Leticia James just a short while ago outlining
[1:10:26.880 --> 1:10:32.200]  the stunning allegations against the NRA and four top executives with a long
[1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:36.440]  list of misdeeds that she says have allegedly drained the accounts of the
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:41.520]  long-standing organization for years New York's top legal officer filing the
[1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:45.840]  lawsuit today in state Supreme Court in Manhattan against the NRA and Wayne
[1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:50.600]  LaPierre the executive vice president of the powerful gun rights group stating
[1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:54.800]  that investigators have been looking into the fraud allegations since February
[1:10:54.800 --> 1:11:00.040]  of 2019 now the lawsuit claims that LaPierre and several top lieutenants
[1:11:00.040 --> 1:11:06.000]  engaged in a decades-long pattern of fraud to raid the funds of the NRA for
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:11.200]  personal gain draining the organization of 64 million dollars in just three
[1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:15.040]  years saying that they've been using millions upon millions of dollars from
[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:20.040]  the NRA for personal use including for lavish trips for themselves that's
[1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:23.320]  enough that's enough so so this woman says in her opening statement we played
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:27.920]  it earlier if I cue it up to that she says I want to abolish and get rid of the
[1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:33.920]  NRA forever oh but now she cares because they had lavish meals and that the
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:44.360]  executives board flew on jets to give speeches oh but again the problem is
[1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:48.520]  they rolled over because I remember a year and a half ago when she opened the
[1:11:48.520 --> 1:11:52.280]  criminal investigation she was it was criminal then now it's civil that she
[1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:58.320]  said oh they're laundering money through the NRA TV because that's money from the
[1:11:58.320 --> 1:12:02.480]  NRA and and now this is a TV network they're launching yeah that's what
[1:12:02.480 --> 1:12:06.680]  nonprofits need TV networks conservatives need TV networks pro-gun
[1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:11.560]  Christians we need our own networks we don't need CNN and Google where we're
[1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:16.880]  all banned and that was their big sin the same sin I committed when I launched
[1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:21.680]  us on TV satellites already on radio and we were launching more shows and
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:25.880]  building up and getting picked up on stations they filed over 50 DNC funded
[1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:31.840]  lawsuits and investigations against us including Latissa James and my lawyers
[1:12:31.840 --> 1:12:34.600]  are like don't talk about that well I mean what am I gonna talk but I don't
[1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:38.880]  care what they do to me they're the criminals they're bad I don't care she's
[1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:42.720]  a murderer Latissa James sent people to the nursing homes to get high death
[1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:48.440]  rates she's Joseph frickin Mingla in the flesh these people are the enemy of this
[1:12:48.440 --> 1:12:54.080]  country and they're never going to stop till we stop them
[1:12:54.600 --> 1:13:05.660]  human freedom the Wild Wild West the Renaissance America human liberty the
[1:13:05.660 --> 1:13:13.720]  West built all the freedom all the choices all the empowerment we see the
[1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:18.280]  general population has been programmed that submission to tyranny brings them
[1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:24.000]  prosperity because the last 50 years under psychotic globalist control they
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:29.520]  have taught us by successive approximation to bow down and each time
[1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:35.120]  be given a reward a treat but that's like training wild pigs to come eat out
[1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:39.640]  of your hand and finally one day you lead them into the barn and close the door
[1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:46.120]  and butcher them we're now reaching that point in societal development where
[1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:52.040]  submission is death where submission is the human species being destroyed
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:57.520]  forever on the altar of Satan been on air in 26 years starting about 24 years
[1:13:57.520 --> 1:14:02.800]  ago I began to get calls from major Hollywood directors producers actors
[1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:06.560]  they wanted to meet with me and they said what is your formal education I
[1:14:06.560 --> 1:14:10.360]  said well really nothing but a few years of college they said well how are you
[1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:15.640]  one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard the
[1:14:15.640 --> 1:14:20.320]  stuff you come up with is just unbelievable we'd like to be in movies
[1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:23.920]  we'd like you to write with us we'd like you to do voiceovers you're just a
[1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:27.240]  Renaissance man that folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer made
[1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:30.760]  statements like that a lot of others I'm not bragging I kept explaining to him I
[1:14:30.760 --> 1:14:35.840]  said do you understand I didn't come up with any of this I'm reading globalist
[1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:41.040]  MIT white papers and futurist documents and they would just laugh me and say oh
[1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:45.040]  no way then I would give them the documents they would get very very scared
[1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:48.560]  you know the next time I saw him in a few months and say man you're right this is
[1:14:48.560 --> 1:14:57.520]  just hoping folks I didn't make any of this up okay it's real it's real you're
[1:14:57.520 --> 1:15:01.880]  listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:12.160]  the globalists are launching everything they've got to destroy the Western
[1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:16.600]  world and capitalism and consolidate under the megabanks total planetary
[1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:20.520]  anti Christ takeover is now in full swing Margaret the Beast is being announced
[1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:26.040]  under the United Nations control the average citizen is invoking the WHO
[1:15:26.040 --> 1:15:30.800]  when they throw old ladies out of stores not wearing masks it's here the new
[1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:34.880]  world order I'm Alex Jones your host all right I said I want to go to some
[1:15:34.880 --> 1:15:39.280]  calls specifically on the NRA what do you think we need to do as the American
[1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:42.120]  people because they want to get rid of our main lobby for the Second Amendment
[1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:47.480]  the very corrupt evil New York City that is launching its cancerous attacks
[1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:51.120]  across the country today with California we need the president and Congress to
[1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:55.960]  step in we need to understand that we need to get on the offense with the
[1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:59.760]  president calling for the prosecution of Leticia James and Governor Cuomo not
[1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:03.720]  being nice to them the NRA needs to come out and run ads about Leticia James
[1:16:03.720 --> 1:16:08.880]  sending people to die in the nursing homes if they roll over it's over for
[1:16:08.880 --> 1:16:13.800]  them they need to go after her for her murder her premeditated murder when she
[1:16:13.800 --> 1:16:18.000]  ordered those those nursing homes with threat of jail if they didn't follow
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:25.920]  Dr. Cuomo's orders Dr. Leticia James's orders Bill Gates's orders the UN's
[1:16:25.920 --> 1:16:31.520]  orders but that's how they cover up just like they're putting checkpoints up for

[1:16:35.560 --> 1:16:44.760]  it's how these criminals cover up 877-789-2539 877-789-2539 877-789 Alex

[1:19:11.400 --> 1:19:17.280]  murderer a criminal a political monster of sorrows you must attack sorrows you
[1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:21.400]  must attack her you must attack that they send people to their death the NRA
[1:19:21.400 --> 1:19:29.080]  must use its power and double down not bend over to that sorrows monster yeah
[1:19:29.080 --> 1:19:34.400]  they need to bring back certain people that for whatever reason they have this
[1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:39.880]  associate themselves with like holy on the war his channel on YouTube is by far
[1:19:39.880 --> 1:19:44.920]  the best prose second amendment channel and I don't know why they stopped
[1:19:44.920 --> 1:19:48.600]  working with him and stop having him as a spokesperson but they need to bring
[1:19:48.600 --> 1:19:54.360]  people like him back they need to bring back the NRA TV and I don't see how they
[1:19:54.360 --> 1:19:58.200]  haven't understood that they bowed a little bit and they took everything
[1:19:58.200 --> 1:20:01.880]  that's what they've been preaching to us for years if we give them a little
[1:20:01.880 --> 1:20:05.600]  they're gonna take a mile and they just took ten miles from the NRA and it's
[1:20:05.600 --> 1:20:10.360]  time to stand up and do something stop bending over to them that's right
[1:20:10.360 --> 1:20:15.040]  LaPierre instead of hiding somewhere he's to come out if he thinks he did
[1:20:15.040 --> 1:20:17.920]  anything wrong he's to step down so they don't bring the whole organization down
[1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:20.880]  but they're gonna get him for a crooked toenail and he needs to come out and say
[1:20:20.880 --> 1:20:24.520]  did we fly around places and we do things that we have absolutely we did we
[1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:28.480]  fight hard and we're defending the second and what matters is results and then
[1:20:28.480 --> 1:20:32.440]  attack Leticia James for all her criminal activity and that witch will put her tail
[1:20:32.440 --> 1:20:36.800]  between her legs and piss herself but instead everyone grovels to these empty
[1:20:36.800 --> 1:20:44.240]  nobodies that woman is a murderer a premeditated Jeffrey Dahmer yeah they
[1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:49.040]  need to just that they need to stop cowering and keep fighting because if
[1:20:49.040 --> 1:20:52.280]  they don't fight they're gonna take absolutely everything from a second
[1:20:52.280 --> 1:20:55.800]  amendment they're privately owned business too how can they go after a
[1:20:55.800 --> 1:20:59.720]  privately owned business and say oh you're flying around on private jets and
[1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:02.720]  that's because they did it as a tax exempt thing because it promotes an
[1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:07.280]  American right and the left then acts like oh you've got political views and
[1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:10.760]  your tax exempt yeah second amendment so they tried to convince them that you're
[1:21:10.760 --> 1:21:14.400]  not allowed to have a TV network and promote news and information no that's
[1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:19.600]  because the formula is we all need as American patriots to support independent
[1:21:19.600 --> 1:21:23.840]  media to have a counter because the NRA would be bigger than Fox News if they
[1:21:23.840 --> 1:21:28.240]  kept going Fox News is part of this they play the part of the loyal opposition
[1:21:28.240 --> 1:21:32.680]  while the system doesn't let anybody else ever get set up and anybody that's
[1:21:32.680 --> 1:21:37.480]  good at Fox News the same combine inside now go after them like Tucker Carlson
[1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:43.120]  yeah Fox News absolutely is controlled opposition with this they only give you
[1:21:43.120 --> 1:21:47.880]  a little bit of the information just to get you just to get you baited into to
[1:21:47.880 --> 1:21:50.760]  what they're believing but you know what's holding part of the truth is the
[1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:55.000]  same as lying to me and they need to stop with this because they only have
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:58.520]  one good reporter on there like you say every day and that's that's Tucker
[1:21:58.520 --> 1:22:03.040]  Carlson and then and even he won't even dab into the truth of what's really
[1:22:03.040 --> 1:22:07.600]  going on with everything he knows it's going God bless you brother Brian and
[1:22:07.600 --> 1:22:15.160]  Georgia you're on the air go ahead and talk about master real quick I'm

[1:22:25.080 --> 1:22:28.600]  the beautiful state of New Hampshire where I'm from anyway I just wanted to
[1:22:28.600 --> 1:22:34.120]  reach out real quick and say it's the beginning I have not complied this mask
[1:22:34.120 --> 1:22:37.360]  order I have not complied to the state home orders none of it and none of us
[1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:42.560]  should people need to stop being scared of this tyrannical government that we
[1:22:42.560 --> 1:22:46.920]  put in place people need to remember that we the people are the ones who have
[1:22:46.920 --> 1:22:50.880]  this government in place and we shouldn't be backing down in the time
[1:22:50.880 --> 1:22:54.640]  when we need to stand up we've been backing down for so long now and to add
[1:22:54.640 --> 1:22:58.360]  to that with the mask I got family that say oh it's just a mask it's just a mask
[1:22:58.360 --> 1:23:01.800]  right we should comply well then I asked the question where you draw the line of
[1:23:01.800 --> 1:23:05.320]  this medical tyranny because the next is forced inoculations we all know that
[1:23:05.320 --> 1:23:10.280]  right so oh they said that they said you don't take the mask off till you take a
[1:23:10.280 --> 1:23:14.600]  shot now they say CNN says it's like safety safety belts you never take them
[1:23:14.600 --> 1:23:18.800]  off even in your house it's the law this is a cult to cover your face to not see
[1:23:18.800 --> 1:23:22.240]  fellow humans to act like we're bad to act like we can't be near each other to
[1:23:22.240 --> 1:23:26.320]  close all our parks and it's all based on a giant fraud wait till they release a
[1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:29.320]  real bio weapon and Bill Gates says he is Ryan
[1:23:29.320 --> 1:23:34.880]  100% 100% Alex and I want to say too man you know my brothers didn't die on
[1:23:34.880 --> 1:23:39.080]  these battlefields for Americans to be scared of a tyrannical government we're
[1:23:39.080 --> 1:23:41.760]  more powerful than that we need the men to stand up like we've always been
[1:23:41.760 --> 1:23:44.640]  talking about that's right we need to form groups and peacefully go into these
[1:23:44.640 --> 1:23:47.760]  stores without our masks handing out flyers educating people we must go in
[1:23:47.760 --> 1:23:52.360]  the offense now go on the offense or lose everything to communist fighters
[1:23:52.360 --> 1:23:58.400]  imagine telling someone just a year ago that in the middle of 2020 the Democrats
[1:23:58.400 --> 1:24:03.160]  as well as many Republican leaders will be calling for the United Nations WHO
[1:24:03.160 --> 1:24:11.120]  edict that all Americans wear masks be a quote federal order and mandate totally
[1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:17.040]  unconstitutional annihilating states rights think about that a woman can kill
[1:24:17.040 --> 1:24:21.640]  her baby you pay for illegal aliens health care but you've got to wear a
[1:24:21.640 --> 1:24:27.640]  mask for a virus that killed 20 plus times less than what they said even if
[1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:31.960]  you believe the official story this is about the WHO the globalist testing
[1:24:31.960 --> 1:24:37.520]  their power through the media over the federal government to set policy in the
[1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:41.960]  United States is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the
[1:24:41.960 --> 1:24:45.880]  Paris Accord and all of it and by the way they admit that they say now your
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:53.800]  carbon's down one way or another you stupid Americans America and the world

[1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:29.400]  lot of our jobs back he sort of took time in his shine on one-sided trade
[1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:33.080]  deals he kicked out some of the deep state but they are just belligerently
[1:27:33.080 --> 1:27:38.400]  criminally now announcing plans to quote abolish the NRA dissolve it for no
[1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:44.040]  reason made up crap being executed by a political minion of Soros and now you
[1:27:44.040 --> 1:27:48.680]  know why Soros is finance attorney generals and hundreds and hundreds of
[1:27:48.680 --> 1:27:52.880]  district attorneys and county attorneys because they are involved in a just
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:57.440]  savage political witch hunt and republicans won't ever even prosecute
[1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:02.600]  them for real crimes they commit because republicans are scared and
[1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:09.680]  republicans think rolling over to all of this is gonna get them left alone and
[1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:16.880]  passed over no it's not I know the last 50 years laying down got you ahead the
[1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:19.440]  globalists are ending the two-party system right now they're coming in for
[1:28:19.440 --> 1:28:22.960]  takeover because they know everybody's rejecting them they know they've
[1:28:22.960 --> 1:28:25.600]  destroyed their blue cities and blue states they know there's an exodus away
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:29.080]  from those so they're just gonna suck those down as fast as they can to create
[1:28:29.080 --> 1:28:33.680]  black holes of financial collapse and economic and cultural destruction that
[1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:37.760]  suck everything else into it then the whole country goes into globalist
[1:28:37.760 --> 1:28:42.080]  receivership bankrupted a banana republic and they're gonna have a reign of
[1:28:42.080 --> 1:28:46.720]  terror consolidating control and having their way with everybody and all the
[1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:50.160]  yuppies and all the trendies and everybody that thought going along would
[1:28:50.160 --> 1:28:55.760]  get them ahead are gonna grovel even more with the social credit scores and
[1:28:55.760 --> 1:29:00.560]  everything and say we'll do whatever Hollywood and the media say whatever big
[1:29:00.560 --> 1:29:05.680]  tech says just bring back the golf and the tennis and the and the sex and the
[1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:10.040]  drugs will just please we groveled we groveled why are you taking everything
[1:29:10.040 --> 1:29:17.800]  it's because it's what they do they destroy countries
[1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:25.920]  and CNN the debate over mass today is a lot like the fight to mandate seatbelts
[1:29:25.920 --> 1:29:31.040]  it's a long article by this woman that writes loveless PR pieces Scotty Andrew
[1:29:31.040 --> 1:29:37.200]  you've been doing it since college I wouldn't look her up take your microchip
[1:29:37.200 --> 1:29:40.960]  the debate over mass today is a lot like a long fight to mandate seatbelts she's
[1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:44.640]  a psychologically we're gonna pressure you and you will submit finally and you
[1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:52.200]  will wear a mask everywhere and it's all over the news oh and never shake hands
[1:29:52.200 --> 1:30:00.840]  again never shake hands again what a sick sick sick cult meanwhile millions are
[1:30:00.840 --> 1:30:09.640]  starving to death but people are waking up here's the problem the globalists and
[1:30:09.640 --> 1:30:13.960]  their minions never get in trouble Governor Cuomo and Leticia James and
[1:30:13.960 --> 1:30:16.760]  Governor Wolf and also the Democrat governors that sent people to nursing
[1:30:16.760 --> 1:30:19.440]  homes knowing that it's the only group would actually die on the studies from
[1:30:19.440 --> 1:30:24.320]  Europe to get half the death numbers from those old people and now the very
[1:30:24.320 --> 1:30:28.640]  same Attorney General is saying the numbers of the new debtor secret the
[1:30:28.640 --> 1:30:34.280]  FBI will give her probably an award oh you're murdering more oh good leticia oh
[1:30:34.280 --> 1:30:44.840]  good Governor Cuomo you're so good he's like yeah I'll kill whoever I want and
[1:30:44.840 --> 1:30:50.040]  they'll make 52 thousand dollars while they kill the old people and he'll lick
[1:30:50.040 --> 1:30:54.280]  his lips all day long because a lot of the nursing homes said don't do this this
[1:30:54.280 --> 1:30:58.200]  will kill folks they said shut up because the big ones in the state lobby to the
[1:30:58.200 --> 1:31:02.440]  U.N. and others to make this the mandate to get that high rate get that 50
[1:31:02.440 --> 1:31:06.560]  something thousand each person they killed and then the big banks like it
[1:31:06.560 --> 1:31:13.560]  because that's all that money they don't have to pay off the death panel see how
[1:31:13.560 --> 1:31:21.240]  it works all right let's go to more calls here let's talk to a minute man in
[1:31:21.240 --> 1:31:28.520]  Virginia a minute man what do we do hey Alex how you doing I'm alright brother go ahead hey
[1:31:28.520 --> 1:31:34.800]  so I called in tell you about this our great governor in Virginia how
[1:31:34.800 --> 1:31:41.920]  yesterday he put out the app that China has been putting out for the pandemic and
[1:31:41.920 --> 1:31:47.560]  corona coronavirus basically you know monitoring how far and how distance how
[1:31:47.560 --> 1:31:51.040]  close you got to be to someone and then all of a sudden you got to go home
[1:31:51.040 --> 1:31:54.400]  if it lights up red or yellow or something like that yeah that's right the
[1:31:54.400 --> 1:31:57.480]  governor is trying to mandate everybody on their phones have an app that the
[1:31:57.480 --> 1:32:00.960]  communist Chinese created for social distancing Benjamin Netanyahu has also
[1:32:00.960 --> 1:32:05.680]  been pushing it oh yeah most definitely and then they say oh it's not gonna
[1:32:05.680 --> 1:32:09.920]  control you it's not gonna get your data all this and that but yet they forget
[1:32:09.920 --> 1:32:14.600]  people forget in Virginia that you put out about our great great senator mark
[1:32:14.600 --> 1:32:20.360]  Warner it's getting paid for our data every day people don't realize that it's
[1:32:20.360 --> 1:32:24.400]  saying it's through Bluetooth and I'm telling you this now Alex so just
[1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:30.800]  because of that I actually ordered two of your on pocket protectors you know
[1:32:30.800 --> 1:32:34.400]  your data protectors oh listen we're selling we used to sell probably a
[1:32:34.400 --> 1:32:37.880]  couple hundred of these a month we're selling a thousand a day they cost us
[1:32:37.880 --> 1:32:42.080]  over $11 they're still at $19.95 and it's a little fair day cage you put the
[1:32:42.080 --> 1:32:46.160]  phone in there it slips into your pocket smoothly and then hackers government
[1:32:46.160 --> 1:32:50.600]  COVID trackers all of them don't ping your location and so that when you're
[1:32:50.600 --> 1:32:54.000]  quoting nexus somebody that they claim has COVID most of its fraud they will
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:57.600]  then claim you have COVID-2 and put you in a database to say that you're
[1:32:57.600 --> 1:33:01.720]  guilty so think already to go to Barton Springs in Austin they make you
[1:33:01.720 --> 1:33:05.720]  encode yourself into a system so I mean this is absolute tyranny folks and
[1:33:05.720 --> 1:33:10.080]  everybody needs to get their privacy pockets at info or store.com and I'm
[1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:15.200]  glad you reminded me that Virginia and California are both launching the apps
[1:33:15.200 --> 1:33:18.240]  and trying to make you have them first it'll be government employees and the
[1:33:18.240 --> 1:33:22.880]  cops then it'll be all of us it's always make the enforcers do it first that's
[1:33:22.880 --> 1:33:25.400]  why they're pressuring the cops right now to make sure they roll over and
[1:33:25.400 --> 1:33:29.800]  submit do not submit police it'll only get worse the more you follow these
[1:33:29.800 --> 1:33:33.760]  globalist orders these are not Americans. Governor Northam is a trader on the
[1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:39.720]  Chai-Com payroll. I absolutely agree to that and another thing I want to bring
[1:33:39.720 --> 1:33:43.440]  up too is that you were talking about the Republicans need to stand up
[1:33:43.440 --> 1:33:47.320]  Americans need to stand up it doesn't matter if you're not if you're a
[1:33:47.320 --> 1:33:52.320]  politician or an average Joe just like Alex Jones or just all his info crew or
[1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:56.520]  just me talking this is for your listeners the listeners they need to
[1:33:56.520 --> 1:34:00.720]  rise up everybody needs to rise up whether you're talking in your next door
[1:34:00.720 --> 1:34:06.360]  neighbor talking to employees talking to anyone rise up because you are the next
[1:34:06.360 --> 1:34:10.520]  generation as well to be that next politician. I agree when you see people
[1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:14.120]  at the store say listen they're making the mask mandatory they're preparing for
[1:34:14.120 --> 1:34:17.480]  contact tracing they're gonna give you inoculations it's a fraud it's a takeover
[1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:22.720]  and just warn people warn people don't go into the slave pitch without saying no
[1:34:22.720 --> 1:34:26.240]  it's speaking up because the arrests are beginning and people need to see the
[1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:31.760]  pushback now. Exactly so that's all I really wanted to say Alex and the NRA is
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:36.840]  doing well I hope they fight this lawsuit because I'm an NRA member I support
[1:34:36.840 --> 1:34:40.860]  NRA and there's other organization groups out there like the there's a
[1:34:40.860 --> 1:34:46.320]  Virginia guns gun guns. Absolutely NRA politicians are scared of them they do
[1:34:46.320 --> 1:34:50.120]  a great job they were they were saw 15 years ago they're good now we do not
[1:34:50.120 --> 1:34:53.840]  need them shut down all you need to know is George Soros's main minion is
[1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:58.200]  trying to shut them down none of it's true it's all garbage back to NRA the
[1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:02.000]  only problem the NRA has against her is that they are the ones scared rolling
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:06.800]  over because conservatives are always listening to the left's lies like when
[1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:10.200]  well he said James said Alex Jones is a criminal he says he has a COVID-19 cure
[1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:15.760]  that's her evil mouth saying that they're attributing it to me you understand
[1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:19.760]  and so she says oh the NRA's evil that they flaunt they flaunt private jets
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:23.840]  then the NRA gets rid of its TV network to try to be you know that that that's
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:30.520]  like blood in the water for that demonic walrus to come after you. Absolutely I
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:36.800]  agree absolutely all right men and man God bless you oh go ahead he's gone
[1:35:36.800 --> 1:35:42.880]  all right listen we got Bobby we got Dylan we got Phil we got Derek we got
[1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:49.080]  Brennan we got Lucas we got resistance and we have Daryl Runders coming in in
[1:35:49.080 --> 1:35:51.800]  the next hour but it takes a few minutes to get people in here and get
[1:35:51.800 --> 1:35:58.040]  them seated so we're gonna go to break we're gonna come back and I'm gonna pop
[1:35:58.040 --> 1:36:00.760]  three callers in I'm gonna play a little clip and then we're gonna get Daryl
[1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:04.000]  Runders in here and we'll continue with your calls as well but I haven't got into
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:08.600]  Oprah Winfrey you know the more I thought about her why don't I attack her as
[1:36:08.600 --> 1:36:12.520]  much as Bill Gates or Warren Buffett or Ted Turner she's just as evil and then
[1:36:12.520 --> 1:36:16.000]  all the stuff I know about her that's why they were talking about her running
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:19.440]  against Trump he says yeah I hope she runs well she's got a lot of bad stuff
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:25.800]  in her closet he knows what's in her closet she ran with Jeffrey Epstein and
[1:36:25.800 --> 1:36:32.000]  gasoline Maxwell heavily and she also ran with who Harvey Weinstein and she
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:37.600]  likes the same thing young girls hey if it isn't true sue me Oprah the point is
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:40.840]  though she's blackmailed she's compromised and the house of cards goes
[1:36:40.840 --> 1:36:45.080]  down she goes down okay her husbands are beards but that's not the issue the
[1:36:45.080 --> 1:36:49.600]  issue is she's a Nazi eugenicist that hates black people
[1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:55.440]  the BBC is state-run media in the UK and they've come out with a detailed

[1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:32.480]  they tried every time nobody could figure out what it is and then every day
[1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:35.640]  when I kept hearing you and doctor group and those commercials I said you know

[1:42:41.480 --> 1:42:46.520]  New York a postal worker on the mail-in ballots and the NRA welcome hey what's
[1:42:46.520 --> 1:42:51.120]  going on Alex I'm good sir good talk to you yep I'm on United States Postal
[1:42:51.120 --> 1:42:56.240]  Service worker I listen to the show every day when I'm out walking my route and we
[1:42:56.240 --> 1:43:00.880]  were briefed before they even had us are wearing masks in the office that we're
[1:43:00.880 --> 1:43:06.120]  doing mail-in voting and now CBS has came out and said even by the first
[1:43:06.120 --> 1:43:11.200]  debate September 19th over 16 states would already voted and by the second
[1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:17.000]  debate over 35 million people probably on estimate would already have voted that
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:21.520]  way that way they've already voted not knowing that Biden is just a shoehorn
[1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:24.840]  to just wait for the next person they're gonna put it isn't that incredible
[1:43:24.840 --> 1:43:28.520]  yeah the first debate we all know what's gonna happen he's gonna shit the
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:33.000]  bad and he's gonna look like who he is so what I'm saying info wars and you get
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:36.160]  in touch with their sources you need to start telling people what to look out
[1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:40.480]  for for mail-in voting fraud because it's gonna decide the election and we all
[1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:44.480]  know it is and we can't let it happen without having at least some things
[1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:48.680]  pointed out go over that because you're more for the Postal Service so you
[1:43:48.680 --> 1:43:51.600]  think so you've already been advised but let's go back to the beginning first
[1:43:51.600 --> 1:43:56.240]  I'm so glad you held and got through because this is all been scripted by the
[1:43:56.240 --> 1:44:00.080]  UN that's why I knew that they do a second lockdown it'd be tighter and then
[1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:04.400]  a third one and even if Trump wins or loses this is the bureaucracy the
[1:44:04.400 --> 1:44:09.520]  corporations that the the the Democrat areas in a corporate governmental coup
[1:44:09.520 --> 1:44:14.720]  ignoring the executive branch so this is just an incredible time of sedition that
[1:44:14.720 --> 1:44:19.000]  we're witnessing where they're telling you oh before the mask agreement put on
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:22.920]  we're gonna have to have mail-in ballots and so before the debates are even done
[1:44:22.920 --> 1:44:27.360]  most people would have already voted that is so sneaky that is so dangerous
[1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:31.480]  that gives the Democrats time to rig those mail-in ballots and stuff those
[1:44:31.480 --> 1:44:34.600]  ballots and pull all sorts of games that's their secret weapon to remove
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:40.160]  Trump and defeat America exactly because you know then if Donald Trump makes a
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:44.120]  fuss about it says that he doesn't agree with the election outcome then you know
[1:44:44.120 --> 1:44:48.160]  what they're already trying to set the narrative out that he's not gonna leave
[1:44:48.160 --> 1:44:52.440]  office they're gonna have to do it through force but honestly in any other
[1:44:52.440 --> 1:44:56.760]  election we haven't had mail-in votes so how could you tell people that you can't
[1:44:56.760 --> 1:45:01.640]  go to the ballot you can't give an actual vote and this person's not the
[1:45:01.640 --> 1:45:06.000]  legitimate president the full four years that he's been in office and then the
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:10.440]  moment that comes time to actually get into the ballots and vote you can't
[1:45:10.440 --> 1:45:15.000]  actually go and do it you got to do it through the mail-in system and who knows
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:18.480]  how legitimate that could actually even work out for like one or two state
[1:45:18.480 --> 1:45:24.720]  elections but it won't the whole country on the same day it just won't work what
[1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:30.040]  are your other fellow postal workers saying about the situation I mean it
[1:45:30.040 --> 1:45:34.280]  you know I don't think anyone actually agrees that you can actually do a mail-in
[1:45:34.280 --> 1:45:37.320]  voting I haven't heard too many people talk about it but there is definitely a
[1:45:37.320 --> 1:45:41.080]  bunch of people that don't like Trump so I wouldn't be surprised if they were
[1:45:41.080 --> 1:45:44.920]  okay with the whole thing well you know how the scam works they mail these out
[1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:48.200]  of the homes of dead people they mail these out of the homes of people that
[1:45:48.200 --> 1:45:52.040]  know they're getting the balance of dead people and they mail these out to people
[1:45:52.040 --> 1:45:55.680]  whose cat died 10 years ago then somebody else fills it out and then when they
[1:45:55.680 --> 1:45:58.760]  get a lot of these ballots back they can just falsify on however they want this
[1:45:58.760 --> 1:46:02.720]  is the takeover and they've already said that if Trump challenges this he's a
[1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:06.000]  dictator so they're already saying we're gonna steal it and if you challenge it
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:09.440]  you're a dictator we're gonna arrest whoever aids you that was the Washington
[1:46:09.440 --> 1:46:13.880]  Post headline if any of his cabinet doesn't agree we'll put you in jail too so
[1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:19.080]  see it's now a reign of terror and they tell you chaos is coming but if Trump
[1:46:19.080 --> 1:46:22.200]  doesn't agree to what we say comes out of the chaos it's his fault that's why
[1:46:22.200 --> 1:46:26.440]  they invoked this for the election and Trump it better take action with 88 days
[1:46:26.440 --> 1:46:30.000]  out well you got to take action too Alex you and info wars you got to get in
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:33.880]  touch with your sources figure out what what's the signs of fraudulent mail
[1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:38.520]  invoking so we do know what the signs are and it's having a mail-in vote that's
[1:46:38.520 --> 1:46:42.520]  unverified the whole thing is a giant complete fraud it's not like we request
[1:46:42.520 --> 1:46:45.600]  an absentee ballot they match it with your voter registration they match it
[1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:49.760]  with your address you get it that still has some problems this is total complete
[1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:53.680]  fraud just dump ballots out everywhere have a total free for all so that in the
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:46:57.800]  blue cities and other areas they could particularly engage in fraud then it's
[1:46:57.800 --> 1:47:01.440]  gonna be a disaster in all the other red cities they won't know what to do they'll
[1:47:01.440 --> 1:47:05.360]  be honest and say it doesn't work those will be thrown out all the frauds
[1:47:05.360 --> 1:47:09.680]  will be kept and president Trump will be removed from office and then the real
[1:47:09.680 --> 1:47:13.480]  reign of terror begins the false flags the terror attacks blaming conservatives
[1:47:13.480 --> 1:47:18.160]  the open borders the collapsing dollar the Democrats are openly saying the
[1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:22.480]  dollars over China's way overinflated their currency compared to us yes we're
[1:47:22.480 --> 1:47:27.200]  in a currency war yes we've overinflated but if we don't will implode if we do we
[1:47:27.200 --> 1:47:30.600]  implode but we still stay on top economically if we are the last
[1:47:30.600 --> 1:47:35.920]  currency standing so remember how bad it's gonna get if Trump fails and we
[1:47:35.920 --> 1:47:39.920]  fail and the very idiots cheering on for this will be the most hurt by it can
[1:47:39.920 --> 1:47:44.360]  you believe that my friend yeah I mean honestly I think everyone should have
[1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:47.320]  the right to vote even if you don't like Trump and I totally understand like
[1:47:47.320 --> 1:47:51.120]  Trump I didn't vote for the guy either but I just feel that it's a democracy
[1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:55.760]  issue and that I should call on the show because how many people on the CBS is
[1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:59.680]  one that reported by September 19th over 16 states that are gonna vote how many
[1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:03.320]  people do you think they're in CBS you're totally right yeah did you know
[1:48:03.320 --> 1:48:05.760]  the election will be over before it started thank you so much now here's
[1:48:05.760 --> 1:48:09.160]  president Trump taking action against human smuggling and my son stay with us
[1:48:09.160 --> 1:48:13.960]  only today I'm pleased to announce that the Department of Justice has issued
[1:48:13.960 --> 1:48:19.600]  $35 million in grants to 73 organizations nationwide providing
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:25.480]  assistance to human trafficking victims a terrible thing you think of human
[1:48:25.480 --> 1:48:30.120]  trafficking as being an ancient form of crime it's not because of the Internet
[1:48:30.120 --> 1:48:35.200]  it's a very modern crime all over the world not just here all over the world
[1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:41.000]  human trafficking it's usually in women or women and children but it's again
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  because of the Internet it's a terrible situation never been like this and
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:52.080]  also survivors who face heightened dangers during the pandemic it's actually
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:56.960]  increased during the pandemic I guess some reasons are obvious and some
[1:48:56.960 --> 1:49:01.040]  reasons are less obvious but human trafficking we're working very very
[1:49:01.040 --> 1:49:08.440]  strongly the wall is up to 277 miles right now and it's going up by the end
[1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:12.440]  of the year it'll be largely finished shortly shortly after the end of the
[1:49:12.440 --> 1:49:17.400]  year and it's had a tremendous impact a very positive impact on human trafficking
[1:49:17.400 --> 1:49:21.920]  unbelievable impact actually my administration will never rest in our
[1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:25.240]  fight against the human trafficking it's what to me it's one of the most
[1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:31.160]  horrific of crimes and we work very hard and I'm going to be very blunt today
[1:49:31.160 --> 1:49:35.400]  I'm gonna be very serious today I'm not gonna make any jokes I'm not trying to
[1:49:35.400 --> 1:49:39.440]  have any laughs here this is an important message and it's a short one you
[1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:46.240]  gotta go out and vote on November 4th and post midterms post 2018 I didn't
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:51.040]  think I was gonna be able to do it I despise Trump almost as much as left
[1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:56.200]  us do that this is me this is my coming out story to you about my opinions of
[1:49:56.200 --> 1:50:02.080]  Trump in 2016 I worshipped the guy I thought he was gonna just come in and
[1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:07.240]  win for us and do all things he promised and he betrayed us on about 95% of
[1:50:07.240 --> 1:50:12.880]  things that he said left me heartbroken he let all his biggest supporters all
[1:50:12.880 --> 1:50:17.880]  his biggest fans everyone who got him elected in 2016 that populist movement
[1:50:17.880 --> 1:50:22.400]  that put him in office he let those people just get smacked the side so we
[1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:26.760]  could be friends with the big wigs and instead of draining the swamp he built
[1:50:26.760 --> 1:50:34.200]  his own personal theme park in it well we got to give him one more chance I'm
[1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:38.280]  gonna be at the polls November 4th voting for Donald J. Trump because it is
[1:50:38.280 --> 1:50:44.600]  the only option Donald Trump is the only roadblock the only damn between our
[1:50:44.600 --> 1:50:49.840]  country becoming Venezuela because if Joe Biden wins it's not gonna be a Joe
[1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:54.640]  Biden presidency it's gonna be a Bernie Sanders presidency it's gonna be a BLM
[1:50:54.640 --> 1:51:00.760]  presidency it's going to be a communist presidency in America is going to turn
[1:51:00.760 --> 1:51:09.000]  into a third world nation do you really want that Trump may have lied to us he
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:14.400]  may have betrayed us on a lot of things but I think honestly in a second term he
[1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:19.560]  can turn it around if he decides that he doesn't have to listen to the political
[1:51:19.560 --> 1:51:25.200]  hacks and if he decides he wants to give up on becoming mr. popular he can do it
[1:51:25.200 --> 1:51:30.120]  we did we didn't he did not need their help in 2016 to get elected and he
[1:51:30.120 --> 1:51:34.040]  doesn't need it now let's go forward with the real movement he promised let's do
[1:51:34.040 --> 1:51:45.720]  it whether you believe in evolution in the modern theory or not the globalist
[1:51:45.720 --> 1:51:50.400]  controllers do they constantly write about and talk about how they want to
[1:51:50.400 --> 1:51:56.120]  create a global crisis or a group of crises that force humans to quote evolve
[1:51:56.120 --> 1:52:00.360]  in a new better way now when you study how they actually want you to evolve you
[1:52:00.360 --> 1:52:04.080]  believe in that it is to stop having children and merged with silicon bodies
[1:52:04.080 --> 1:52:08.760]  and a post-human future talk about psychotic talk about creepy talk about
[1:52:08.760 --> 1:52:14.240]  crazy but they need an event like COVID-19 to teach a mammal to wear some
[1:52:14.240 --> 1:52:18.720]  covering over its nose over its breathing tubes to set the precedent for
[1:52:18.720 --> 1:52:23.760]  the forced inoculations for the GMO for the 5g and for all the things that they
[1:52:23.760 --> 1:52:28.480]  admit will end our humanity as we know it that's why this is so evil their whole
[1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:34.200]  agenda for cashless society global government UN control getting us all
[1:52:34.200 --> 1:52:38.160]  into debt getting rid of local government think about all the facets of
[1:52:38.160 --> 1:52:47.840]  at the censorship the surveillance Vicky Gibbs 57-year-old lesbian preacher in
[1:52:47.840 --> 1:52:54.720]  Houston went in with a cough got intubated and then died and as soon as
[1:52:54.720 --> 1:52:59.000]  I saw her face as soon as I saw the report I said watch it'll be innovation
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:04.440]  we know what's gonna happen it's a blue city same story yet again and they say
[1:53:04.440 --> 1:53:09.440]  her heart gave out if you put somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19 as a
[1:53:09.440 --> 1:53:12.880]  death sentence it's on record when everyone you know before they go to the
[1:53:12.880 --> 1:53:16.880]  hospital and get killed why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities
[1:53:16.880 --> 1:53:20.760]  in blue states it's because they intubate them putting a tube in their
[1:53:20.760 --> 1:53:25.400]  lungs and COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response and if you do that
[1:53:25.400 --> 1:53:30.480]  with oxygen the doctors are on record saying it will kill you but all these
[1:53:30.480 --> 1:53:34.880]  doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders and the minute I
[1:53:34.880 --> 1:53:39.440]  saw this report today I knew what I would be reading don't end up like Vicky
[1:53:39.440 --> 1:53:42.840]  Gibbs or everyone
[1:53:42.840 --> 1:53:49.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:54:12.840 --> 1:54:25.440]  we're gonna be hosting about 15 minutes the next hour and then we're gonna have
[1:54:25.440 --> 1:54:29.840]  great Patriot taking over the transmission until the war room starts
[1:54:29.840 --> 1:54:35.760]  and that of course is the man with enemies foreign and domestic the former
[1:54:35.760 --> 1:54:41.840]  Navy seal and right now we have Daryl Rundis in studio with us butter flyers
[1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:46.240]  dot com heroes the founder and CEO of the world's largest circulation sales and
[1:54:46.240 --> 1:54:49.080]  marketing firm but some stations don't carry this first five minutes so I'll
[1:54:49.080 --> 1:54:52.680]  introduce you next segment first off I asked my producer a few weeks ago I
[1:54:52.680 --> 1:54:56.160]  said I haven't talked to Daryl Rundis in years you're a good friend of mine you've
[1:54:56.160 --> 1:55:00.160]  been on the show for over 10 years 12 years or so and I'm glad we got in
[1:55:00.160 --> 1:55:02.760]  contact with you I'm glad you're able to come on the show man it's so good to be
[1:55:02.760 --> 1:55:06.760]  here I'll tell you what Alex it's humbling sitting in this chair knowing
[1:55:06.760 --> 1:55:11.680]  who else is sat in this chair I mean amazing powerful men and women who
[1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:17.400]  have had profound and positive impact on this country but today I wanted to take
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:22.120]  this opportunity you know with the short time that I have with you today to
[1:55:22.120 --> 1:55:27.200]  bring a history lesson to people and I brought something that I got from you
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:30.840]  last time I was on this show this is called tyranny crusher and if you would
[1:55:30.840 --> 1:55:36.040]  just give people a little history about how this cord got cut because it's
[1:55:36.040 --> 1:55:40.120]  significant and I'm gonna tie it all together to where we are today well
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:42.880]  since you bring that up I didn't know you were gonna do that guys can you guys
[1:55:42.880 --> 1:55:48.080]  pull up MSNBC attacks Alex Jones cuts microphone cord we've got the video
[1:55:48.080 --> 1:55:52.160]  somewhere I mean the guy literally comes at you with a knife that's right
[1:55:52.160 --> 1:55:57.200]  yeah right I mean and he comes at you because it can't kill the message he
[1:55:57.200 --> 1:56:02.160]  can't kill the messenger so what's he do he cuts the cord and that's where we're
[1:56:02.160 --> 1:56:06.480]  at today this was the salvo this was a shot per round the world
[1:56:06.480 --> 1:56:09.960]  unfortunately people didn't heed the warning you know that that happened at
[1:56:09.960 --> 1:56:15.960]  the DNC 2008 Rob do can probably find it if it's somewhere but I think it was
[1:56:15.960 --> 1:56:21.320]  MSNBC attacks Alex Jones cuts cord of bullhorn yeah and he comes up with a
[1:56:21.320 --> 1:56:26.440]  knife grabs it grabs it cuts it but now look what's happening to everybody I
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:29.720]  mean we've gotten to the place where not only have they de-platformed you you
[1:56:29.720 --> 1:56:34.440]  Google it yesterday they pull the president's tweets and pull them off of
[1:56:34.440 --> 1:56:38.080]  Facebook because he tweets something about COVID-19 yes it's absolutely true
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:43.640]  Kamala Harris of course the new VP candidate the Democrats are in control
[1:56:43.640 --> 1:56:49.080]  Twitter right if that's not enough to scare anybody that when Biden dies which
[1:56:49.080 --> 1:56:52.080]  he probably wouldn't office if he did get elected that would be your president
[1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:55.960]  think about that for a second would you want Camilla to be your president I mean
[1:56:55.960 --> 1:56:59.640]  I can't imagine a scandal when we pointed out that he had cognitive issues two
[1:56:59.640 --> 1:57:02.800]  years ago and then he'll end up stepping down and she's the president she's a
[1:57:02.800 --> 1:57:07.200]  total puppet well and I don't want to get too off track here because the reason
[1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:10.080]  I came here down down here today from Dallas is I wanted to talk to you a
[1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:14.360]  little bit about this because this once again was the foreshadowing of what
[1:57:14.360 --> 1:57:17.200]  was to go let's start over because again some stations don't care the first five
[1:57:17.200 --> 1:57:20.440]  minutes but I wanted to get you in here it's gonna get you in there late it takes
[1:57:20.440 --> 1:57:23.080]  a few minutes people in to name the cameras and all that so when we come
[1:57:23.080 --> 1:57:27.000]  back restart your story and let's see if we can find that if we can't find it
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:30.280]  while we're live right now on TV and radio obviously radio can't see it I'm
[1:57:30.280 --> 1:57:35.840]  sure today in post when we post this to band on video will you guys ask Rob do
[1:57:35.840 --> 1:57:41.240]  or some of the crew to find I think it's Alex Jones takes over MSNBC Alex
[1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:45.520]  Jones takes over was it hardball I think it was Chris Matthews that yeah they
[1:57:45.520 --> 1:57:49.040]  found the old livestream yeah but we've got HD video this too remember old
[1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:53.040]  Justin TV oh yeah yeah but yeah we've got the HD of this too somewhere where the
[1:57:53.040 --> 1:57:57.400]  guy comes up and cuts the cord yeah but but to me you know I have this sitting
[1:57:57.400 --> 1:58:02.840]  in a in a case in my office and it reminds me of how one man how God took
[1:58:02.840 --> 1:58:08.560]  one man with one bullhorn and practically brought the new world order down to
[1:58:08.560 --> 1:58:13.280]  its knees and it makes me think how many other Alex Joneses are there out there
[1:58:13.280 --> 1:58:18.560]  that have yet to rise up wise up speak up and not shut up and because here's the
[1:58:18.560 --> 1:58:24.640]  thing how many Samson's are there that need to that's right how many other
[1:58:24.640 --> 1:58:29.400]  people out there that are disobeying the calling that God has on their life and
[1:58:29.400 --> 1:58:34.480]  here's the thing okay if all the great amazing or horrible adjectives people
[1:58:34.480 --> 1:58:39.040]  may use to describe you there's one that I often think of and we'll talk about it
[1:58:39.040 --> 1:58:41.640]  when we will recap as me that's what you're saying is powerful and it's not
[1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:44.600]  about us it's about everybody else being inspired right there around us is our

[2:00:40.920 --> 2:00:44.360]  it's actually very rare birth defect that where you're born with partial
[2:00:44.360 --> 2:00:48.640]  intestines oh wow in fact for the first few years my life about two years my
[2:00:48.640 --> 2:00:52.360]  life was in the hospital oh wow and what's interesting about that and not to
[2:00:52.360 --> 2:00:56.280]  get sidetracked too much but you know they always said to my my mom if you

[2:01:04.680 --> 2:01:11.040]  thinks they got the retarded part right but but in all serious now Alex I wanted
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:15.000]  to kind of let me finish up your bio here yeah yeah I'm like you I don't like
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:17.520]  people since the day he became a Christian Darrell has had a tremendous
[2:01:17.520 --> 2:01:21.480]  amount of love for the lost and exceptionally grown as an evangelist
[2:01:21.480 --> 2:01:24.800]  and Christian he's preached and taught in churches all around the world he's
[2:01:24.800 --> 2:01:28.560]  worked with people like Alex Jones Glenbeck Chuck Baldwin Allen keys her
[2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:33.120]  Cameron Ray Comfort Mark Cahill Josh McDonald many many others
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:36.800]  Butterflyers.com you're also a big marketer but wasn't your dad a preacher
[2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:41.160]  yeah and so so that you kind of rebelled against the dad and then right yeah
[2:01:41.160 --> 2:01:44.720]  I hate it but I grew up I was a Saul de Paul experience I grew up hating
[2:01:44.720 --> 2:01:47.880]  Christians I would have told you the Bible was a big thick dusty book filled
[2:01:47.880 --> 2:01:52.360]  with rules to make your life miserable right that if the Bible was even true it
[2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:56.760]  was just a cleverly invented story to control the masses and to keep them from
[2:01:56.760 --> 2:02:02.920]  rising and so what what made you have that well for me what I kind of did with
[2:02:02.920 --> 2:02:06.880]  you a while back and even though you were already saved it really kind of took
[2:02:06.880 --> 2:02:09.880]  it to another level it helps you get a deeper understanding and relationship
[2:02:09.880 --> 2:02:14.920]  which is what it was really all about was basically I asked people I said I
[2:02:14.920 --> 2:02:19.360]  said I said Alex would you trade your eyes for a million bucks and he said no
[2:02:19.360 --> 2:02:24.040]  I said how about 10 million you said no way I said what if I gave you all Bill
[2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:27.040]  Gates money would you do it you said absolutely not men my eyes are valuable
[2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:30.360]  they're precious and I was like well if your eyes are merely the window to your
[2:02:30.360 --> 2:02:34.680]  soul then how much more is the soul that looks out those eyes were you wouldn't
[2:02:34.680 --> 2:02:37.640]  trade your eyes for all the money in the world don't trade your soul for so much
[2:02:37.640 --> 2:02:41.400]  less and we got to talk in and we just became quick friends and now hasn't
[2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:45.560]  become obvious that it's a spiritual battle and now the atheists are like
[2:02:45.560 --> 2:02:48.560]  we're not atheists we're devil worshipers they're pulling down Christ statues
[2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:52.440]  putting up Bathoma statues Satanism's out in the open now we're you know we're
[2:02:52.440 --> 2:02:56.320]  definitely going to be addressing that today because I feel like we're in a
[2:02:56.320 --> 2:03:02.600]  parallel experience to Nebuchadnezzar or bells bells are who was his son who
[2:03:02.600 --> 2:03:06.880]  inherited the kingdom the greatest kingdom of all right you know Babylon
[2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:12.000]  and unfortunately squandered it and then he saw the writing on the wall and a
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.720]  few years ago I did a really important message called the writing's on the
[2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:18.200]  wall and most people didn't eat it most people didn't even watch it YouTube
[2:03:18.200 --> 2:03:22.480]  suppressed it and so much more and now I feel like we're at that point where the
[2:03:22.480 --> 2:03:27.320]  enemies are in the gate right the writing's on the wall the modern American
[2:03:27.320 --> 2:03:32.720]  Christian has been weighed in the balance and found wanting they are lukewarm
[2:03:32.720 --> 2:03:36.520]  lazy Christians they don't get up has God's edge of protection been lifted or
[2:03:36.520 --> 2:03:40.880]  is it just partially been lifted to give us a last chance you know I think God is
[2:03:40.880 --> 2:03:45.240]  giving us this last shaking I think he's saying look if you won't repent if you
[2:03:45.240 --> 2:03:50.280]  won't come back to me if you won't stand up and fight against evil and
[2:03:50.280 --> 2:03:54.800]  wickedness and tyranny then I've got no choice you've turned for me I'd rather
[2:03:54.800 --> 2:03:59.160]  you be hot or cold Jesus says it's the lukewarm lazy Christian that makes him
[2:03:59.160 --> 2:04:03.360]  literally sick to his stomach and so I'm here today as a it's kind of a call to
[2:04:03.360 --> 2:04:08.040]  action a call to challenge to tell Christians look it's okay to get up and
[2:04:08.040 --> 2:04:12.240]  to get out and to speak up don't be afraid of men okay what can men do to
[2:04:12.240 --> 2:04:16.240]  you I mean especially like we took take this COVID-19 thing and and where are
[2:04:16.240 --> 2:04:18.960]  the mask and all these other things what's the worst that can happen as you
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:23.240]  die well if you're really soundly saved if you've sold out for Christ man you're
[2:04:23.240 --> 2:04:27.320]  going home to your reward you should be have a statistically it's all alive put
[2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:30.080]  out by gates the rest of them what so let's get into tyranny Crusher and I
[2:04:30.080 --> 2:04:33.680]  want to get into what you see in the world well this right here we're always
[2:04:33.680 --> 2:04:39.080]  reminds me of how one man how God can take one man and use him to I mean these
[2:04:39.080 --> 2:04:42.720]  and for the radio listeners it's a it's a bullhorn that I use for more than 10
[2:04:42.720 --> 2:04:46.480]  years and then and man this thing is seen build a burger groups this thing is
[2:04:46.480 --> 2:04:50.800]  seen you know DNC conventions this thing is seen more time than probably any
[2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:56.040]  bullhorn you've ever used yes and to me it was the salvo it was the shot that
[2:04:56.040 --> 2:04:58.920]  most people didn't hear when they come and cut this cord because it was a
[2:04:58.920 --> 2:05:03.360]  foreshadowing of what was to come it was got and recap that story I'm at the DNC
[2:05:03.360 --> 2:05:08.560]  2008 he's bullhorn and it is typical Alex Jones and once again it just to me
[2:05:08.560 --> 2:05:13.200]  it shows that one man with one message that's truth that's truth that's a
[2:05:13.200 --> 2:05:16.840]  perseverance that won't give up can't be defeated by the way that's what the
[2:05:16.840 --> 2:05:19.800]  Democrats did the whole cupboard thing was to lock down public events where we
[2:05:19.800 --> 2:05:23.600]  could bullhorn lock down our NC DNC where you can't speak the truth where we
[2:05:23.600 --> 2:05:26.520]  can't come take over with bullhorns that's right so you get you went out
[2:05:26.520 --> 2:05:30.080]  there they cut the cord but it was only a foreshadowing it was what to come
[2:05:30.080 --> 2:05:34.880]  because now what they've cut you off Facebook they've cut you off YouTube you
[2:05:34.880 --> 2:05:39.520]  can when I googled Alex Jones show yesterday a bunch of pictures of some
[2:05:39.520 --> 2:05:42.400]  chick came up I mean it was that's right they either put her on top or they put
[2:05:42.400 --> 2:05:45.960]  all the lying pieces right so so it just goes to show you it was kind of like we
[2:05:45.960 --> 2:05:49.720]  should have took this this should have been the writing on the wall right here
[2:05:49.720 --> 2:05:53.520]  this should have been God's way of saying to all of us like if they'll try to
[2:05:53.520 --> 2:05:58.240]  silence Alex Jones then they're gonna do it to everybody and of course you
[2:05:58.240 --> 2:06:01.960]  might have been the first culprit the first one that they attacked and it's
[2:06:01.960 --> 2:06:05.240]  an archetype of them trying to cut the other doing the president how they're
[2:06:05.240 --> 2:06:09.120]  trying to cut us off from God from our families they're trying to isolate us but
[2:06:09.120 --> 2:06:12.960]  here it is Kamala Harris's campaign operative is the one that actually works
[2:06:12.960 --> 2:06:16.880]  at Twitter and had Trump kicked off Twitter yesterday well and the president
[2:06:16.880 --> 2:06:20.400]  puts up with that well and you know that's the that's the big secret that
[2:06:20.400 --> 2:06:23.800]  they don't want anybody to know that I want everybody to know today is light
[2:06:23.800 --> 2:06:28.400]  beats darkness and that light is great that light of love the light of liberty
[2:06:28.400 --> 2:06:32.640]  the light of truth and all you got to do is get up and get out and just start
[2:06:32.640 --> 2:06:37.160]  speaking that you forget Twitter forget YouTube you can be your own YouTube
[2:06:37.160 --> 2:06:42.000]  start your own channel to Alex started ban video right it can be anything God's
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:46.760]  called you to do something don't sit satisfied in your own salvation saying
[2:06:46.760 --> 2:06:51.000]  I'm waiting for the rapture and Christ hurry it comes soon because the truth of
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:55.120]  the matter is you're gonna be found wanting you're gonna get weighed in the
[2:06:55.120 --> 2:06:59.360]  balance Jesus says be sure the master finds you doing when he's commanded you
[2:06:59.360 --> 2:07:03.040]  to do when he does return so if you think these are the end times and you
[2:07:03.040 --> 2:07:08.640]  think Christ's return is imminent and soon then you better be sure to suit up
[2:07:08.640 --> 2:07:12.000]  and show up and be out there doing what Christ has commanded you to do because
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:15.480]  if you don't he says he's gonna assign you into a place with a hypocrisy well
[2:07:15.480 --> 2:07:18.360]  I know you're involved in Christian broadcasting at the highest levels and I
[2:07:18.360 --> 2:07:21.520]  just want to have time to keep track of a lot of stuff out of skin the news but
[2:07:21.520 --> 2:07:25.120]  they're announcing digital tattoos under the skin a world government
[2:07:25.120 --> 2:07:29.520]  controlling it the UN tells us what health policy is they want us to take
[2:07:29.520 --> 2:07:33.240]  force inoculations that change our DNA I mean if that isn't Margaret the beast
[2:07:33.240 --> 2:07:36.960]  what is at our churches saying no to this is speaking out are they just going
[2:07:36.960 --> 2:07:41.600]  along with we're not essential we're closed but the liquor stores and the
[2:07:41.600 --> 2:07:45.520]  NFL are open you know it's amazing about that I had a friend just the other day
[2:07:45.520 --> 2:07:50.080]  I love her dearly she's a sweet sweet lady and she loves the Lord okay but she
[2:07:50.080 --> 2:07:55.440]  says oh this this force vaccination with an RNA marker that's gonna change your
[2:07:55.440 --> 2:07:59.120]  DNA that couldn't be the mark of the beast because we'll know what we're doing
[2:07:59.120 --> 2:08:02.920]  if we go to take the mark of the beast and I had to actually laugh at that
[2:08:02.920 --> 2:08:07.520]  because I thought since when has Satan ever been forthright truthful and honest
[2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:11.280]  about any of his intentions he never has and nowhere in the Bible does it say
[2:08:11.280 --> 2:08:14.600]  it's obvious that you're taking the mark of the beast when you take the mark of
[2:08:14.600 --> 2:08:18.000]  the beast okay so I for one would never take the only thing obvious about is
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:21.160]  they say you've got to do this to buy and sell to leave your house to have a
[2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:25.360]  job to get on a plane and it and the social distancing diagrams they put out
[2:08:25.360 --> 2:08:29.920]  are three humans with sixes between them six feet between the number of a man
[2:08:29.920 --> 2:08:33.920]  men must stay six feet apart the barcode only works with six six six over and
[2:08:33.920 --> 2:08:38.240]  over again it tells us what you know Satan lies overtly but then covertly
[2:08:38.240 --> 2:08:41.480]  it's all right there in the handiwork right now it's all there and if I were
[2:08:41.480 --> 2:08:46.920]  you I would walk wisely and suspectly in this world right I would not line up and
[2:08:46.920 --> 2:08:50.800]  say oh I better take the vaccine I better obey you know to obey the
[2:08:50.800 --> 2:08:55.960]  government's better than to obey God no it's a better to obey God than men right
[2:08:55.960 --> 2:08:59.880]  and the funny thing about it is I think back to our first conversation when we
[2:08:59.880 --> 2:09:03.280]  we sat down we talked about the eyes being the window to your soul and those
[2:09:03.280 --> 2:09:07.080]  kind of things and I said Alex what's your motive what's your objective what
[2:09:07.080 --> 2:09:10.960]  is it you want to accomplish with this and you said we're gonna take down the
[2:09:10.960 --> 2:09:16.600]  new world order right you know and I was like you know that's an admirable
[2:09:16.600 --> 2:09:21.200]  objective that's something that's that we should all aspire to do but you'll
[2:09:21.200 --> 2:09:24.500]  fail and you looked at me shocked just like you just did you're like there
[2:09:24.500 --> 2:09:28.000]  what are you talking about we're gonna fail I was like the Bible says there
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:31.400]  will be a one-world government there will be an antichrist he will rule and
[2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:36.600]  reign our objective if your objective is to stop God from fulfilling all the
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:39.800]  things he said that he was gonna be in the Bible you're gonna be defeated you're
[2:09:39.800 --> 2:09:42.320]  gonna get to share let's talk about the rest of story when we come back with

[2:11:48.840 --> 2:12:08.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:18.840 --> 2:12:34.280]  okay you want to get into the antichrist world government and I want to be
[2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:37.720]  clear I never thought that we could stop the antichrist and stop the world
[2:12:37.720 --> 2:12:42.960]  government but if you read the Bible if you study history things repeat they
[2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:46.200]  build their global government then there's the biggest revival ever when
[2:12:46.200 --> 2:12:49.560]  the antichrist comes in so we're in the position to warn people about how all
[2:12:49.560 --> 2:12:53.960]  this is gonna happen they're not gonna listen and then when it all happens then
[2:12:53.960 --> 2:12:56.680]  they're gonna really wake up we're already seeing foreshadowing of people
[2:12:56.680 --> 2:13:01.560]  who thought I was crazy 25 years ago 20 years ago 10 years ago now that it's all
[2:13:01.560 --> 2:13:05.200]  happening our credibility is gone way up so of others no get a point where they
[2:13:05.200 --> 2:13:08.880]  probably kill us or shut us down but then people will remember that they'll
[2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:12.880]  know that so we won't be flat footed up against this dehumanization system and
[2:13:12.880 --> 2:13:17.080]  now the world government says dreaming of the post-human world dreaming of
[2:13:17.080 --> 2:13:20.320]  getting rid of I mean they're telling us that the establishment wants to
[2:13:20.320 --> 2:13:24.440]  transcend humans this is revelation becoming manifest absolutely we're
[2:13:24.440 --> 2:13:28.960]  seeing all those prophecies foretold of old unfold right before our eyes and
[2:13:28.960 --> 2:13:31.920]  now it's just to kind of pick up where we left off so when I said that and you
[2:13:31.920 --> 2:13:34.080]  were like yeah we're gonna take down there we're gonna get the bill of
[2:13:34.080 --> 2:13:36.600]  burgers we're gonna do this and then I was like yeah that's great and I love
[2:13:36.600 --> 2:13:41.400]  that plan but you know here's the thing you're very similar to what I do as a
[2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:46.760]  minister my concept my idea I can't save souls only God can do that but what I
[2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:50.760]  can do is sow the seeds of truth and when I sow those seeds of truth I got a
[2:13:50.760 --> 2:13:54.560]  hope that God brings forth the increase I said your aim your goal needs to be
[2:13:54.560 --> 2:13:59.280]  waking people up bring the knowledge bring the truth bring it passionately so
[2:13:59.280 --> 2:14:05.360]  that then when this day came like you just said they would realize well I
[2:14:05.360 --> 2:14:09.320]  thought Alex was crazy all those years yet now I'm seeing oh those stars are
[2:14:09.320 --> 2:14:13.520]  pedophiles oh wow they do dance around and druid robes and they and they do
[2:14:13.520 --> 2:14:17.720]  worship Moloch and they do do all these horrible things that they used to call
[2:14:17.720 --> 2:14:22.440]  you crazy for in fact once again I want to kind of get back to the simple truth
[2:14:22.440 --> 2:14:28.240]  of the matter and why God can and will use you and anyone else just like he's
[2:14:28.240 --> 2:14:31.080]  used this man right here now Alex I know you don't like it when people toot your
[2:14:31.080 --> 2:14:34.600]  horn you don't like you're like me you know you just try to stay humble you
[2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:37.960]  stay bold in your witness and humble in your heart and that's a good thing to do
[2:14:37.960 --> 2:14:41.920]  that's what God loves he wants a humble servant that does what he wants to do
[2:14:41.920 --> 2:14:46.040]  that'll bend the knee to him and him alone but I do need to take this
[2:14:46.040 --> 2:14:49.600]  opportunity just to encourage other people that look if one man with one
[2:14:49.600 --> 2:14:54.640]  bullion can almost take the whole new world order down okay and now he's
[2:14:54.640 --> 2:14:58.920]  discipling others right you got Owen show you got Owen you got David Knight
[2:14:58.920 --> 2:15:03.400]  you got many other people I mean this studio is amazing Alex when we first
[2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:08.920]  met you're in a small little space coming off of public access television and
[2:15:08.920 --> 2:15:12.640]  you were doing what nobody else had ever thought to do you were doing live
[2:15:12.640 --> 2:15:16.720]  broadcasting while you were on radio nobody had ever thought of doing that
[2:15:16.720 --> 2:15:20.240]  before now that's the thing that's what everybody wants to do and so what I
[2:15:20.240 --> 2:15:23.920]  would encourage you to be is being under Alex Jones because here's the thing
[2:15:23.920 --> 2:15:28.320]  it's not gonna be easy it's gonna be hard in fact the Bible says every
[2:15:28.320 --> 2:15:33.440]  Christian who wants to live a godly life in Christ will suffer persecution okay
[2:15:33.440 --> 2:15:38.280]  look at what Christ had to go through on his path to the cross in order to pay
[2:15:38.280 --> 2:15:42.240]  for the sins of the world okay so well I know he doesn't like people boasting
[2:15:42.240 --> 2:15:46.120]  about him and bragging about him I do want to tell him one thing one thing
[2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:49.800]  above all else people can call him crazy they can call him out of his mind they
[2:15:49.800 --> 2:15:53.960]  can say he's a great businessman or he's this he said whatever it doesn't matter
[2:15:53.960 --> 2:15:58.160]  there's one thing above all else that he has that we all need to have and that's
[2:15:58.160 --> 2:16:02.840]  perseverance you need to learn the race to run that race with perseverance
[2:16:02.840 --> 2:16:06.560]  that's been marked out for you he's running I mean think of all the
[2:16:06.560 --> 2:16:10.960]  obstacles he's been confronted with all the adversity right they cut the cord
[2:16:10.960 --> 2:16:15.600]  literally on him okay he had he persevered he didn't give up he didn't
[2:16:15.600 --> 2:16:19.080]  quit in fact there's an almost time we got four minutes I'm gonna share
[2:16:19.080 --> 2:16:23.520]  something it's an old poem called don't quit you ever heard it no I may have a
[2:16:23.520 --> 2:16:28.520]  tummy I memorized it when I was 18 years old going door-to-door selling magazines
[2:16:28.520 --> 2:16:33.360]  okay as a kid I dropped out of high school when I was 17 years old decided I
[2:16:33.360 --> 2:16:37.040]  would go you know join this traveling sales group and knocking doors if
[2:16:37.040 --> 2:16:40.720]  anybody's ever done it is a very very tough thing to do so I had to stay
[2:16:40.720 --> 2:16:44.200]  positive all the time I had to stay up and I memorized this poem I'm gonna share
[2:16:44.200 --> 2:16:48.360]  it with you right now it says when things go wrong as they sometimes will when
[2:16:48.360 --> 2:16:52.200]  that road you travels all uphill when your funds are low and your debts are
[2:16:52.200 --> 2:16:56.600]  high and you want to smile but you have to sigh when life is pressing you down a
[2:16:56.600 --> 2:17:01.760]  bit rest if you must but do not quit for life is strange with its twist and
[2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:05.840]  turns as each and every one of us sometimes learn and many of people turn
[2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:10.120]  about when they may have one and they stuck it out and they don't realize how
[2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:15.320]  close they were to that crown they give up before the sun came down so don't give
[2:17:15.320 --> 2:17:19.640]  up when the pace seems slow you may succeed with one more blow often the
[2:17:19.640 --> 2:17:24.720]  vigour has given up when he may have captured the winners cup success is
[2:17:24.720 --> 2:17:29.240]  failure turned inside out the silver tint to the clouds of doubt so stick to
[2:17:29.240 --> 2:17:32.480]  the fight when your hardest hit it's when things seem they're worse that you
[2:17:32.480 --> 2:17:36.600]  must not quit and that's where we're at it's where we're at right now this
[2:17:36.600 --> 2:17:42.440]  country is on a tipping point if you won't get up wake up wise up and rise up
[2:17:42.440 --> 2:17:48.040]  right now it's gone it's over it's just like it was on the days of Bell
[2:17:48.040 --> 2:17:52.240]  Salazar when he called in Daniel and he asked him to interpret this writing
[2:17:52.240 --> 2:17:57.800]  that was on the wall it was the hand of God writing on the wall saying you have
[2:17:57.800 --> 2:18:02.480]  turned for me you've taken all that your father had given you and all that he had
[2:18:02.480 --> 2:18:08.240]  done for me and you've squandered it and you now worship idols and you drink
[2:18:08.240 --> 2:18:12.400]  from the chalices that were meant from the temple and so today this very day
[2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:17.800]  the enemy is in your gate and that very night he died he died and that's what
[2:18:17.800 --> 2:18:21.880]  is gonna happen to this country if we do not get Donald Trump elected again if
[2:18:21.880 --> 2:18:25.920]  we continue to do I mean here it's as simple as this Alex I mean think about
[2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:30.880]  this for a second it's not who votes that counts it's who counts the votes and
[2:18:30.880 --> 2:18:35.400]  with this mail-in ballots with all these posts you know these poster workers
[2:18:35.400 --> 2:18:40.560]  in the USPS just endorsed Biden to be president what does that say about
[2:18:40.560 --> 2:18:43.560]  mail-in ballots you think they're gonna take those ballots and now they're
[2:18:43.560 --> 2:18:45.800]  gonna they're gonna look at them they're gonna take the Republican ballots
[2:18:45.800 --> 2:18:49.280]  from the front get involved be the one who counts the ballots don't just vote
[2:18:49.280 --> 2:18:53.280]  be the one that makes sure that that vote counts that's right folks you can
[2:18:53.280 --> 2:18:58.280]  smell it the globalist let me ask this girl why are the minions of evil have
[2:18:58.280 --> 2:19:03.680]  no spirit to him Biden Hillary all of them I mean they're just pathetic
[2:19:03.680 --> 2:19:08.360]  liars and God's making it so obvious that they're so bad we should reject them
[2:19:08.360 --> 2:19:11.360]  but still other people don't reject them when they openly don't believe the
[2:19:11.360 --> 2:19:14.920]  country should even exist you know the funny thing about it most honorable
[2:19:14.920 --> 2:19:21.440]  hard-working let's say good Christian people for example most of morning get
[2:19:21.440 --> 2:19:24.600]  up and go out and share the gospel the good news I mean that's like saying we
[2:19:24.600 --> 2:19:28.360]  have the cure for cancer you're dying of cancer we can see you're sick and we
[2:19:28.360 --> 2:19:31.600]  know you're gonna die yet we don't love you enough to tell you the truth about
[2:19:31.600 --> 2:19:36.400]  the cure for cancer yeah good people seem to think it's pushy to do it you
[2:19:36.400 --> 2:19:41.320]  know why why fear yeah they fear men more than they fear God just like in
[2:19:41.320 --> 2:19:44.680]  Jesus's day there were many the Bible says that believed in him but they
[2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:48.480]  wouldn't profess their their faith in him for fear they'd be thrown out of the
[2:19:48.480 --> 2:19:51.640]  synagogue see the truth is people love the world more than and now we'll be
[2:19:51.640 --> 2:19:55.960]  thrown out if we don't take the the mask the chip the injection it's all
[2:19:55.960 --> 2:19:59.360]  there they obey the rules on Twitter because all I don't want to get I don't
[2:19:59.360 --> 2:20:01.840]  want to get the platform but I don't want to live there's always more more
[2:20:01.840 --> 2:20:05.480]  more that the turn against the news gets tighter tighter and tighter and
[2:20:05.480 --> 2:20:09.280]  tighter and that's why God's saying unless you break free from that I sent my
[2:20:09.280 --> 2:20:12.720]  son to set you free for who the Sun says free is free indeed and if you take
[2:20:12.720 --> 2:20:17.560]  that freedom and that liberty and use it as indulgence use it for sin use it to
[2:20:17.560 --> 2:20:21.400]  continue to go down and buy your cheap china goods at Walmart and your latte

[2:24:22.600 --> 2:24:26.480]  him do it but but first off getting into this lukewarm issue you were neither
[2:24:26.480 --> 2:24:30.960]  hot nor cold so I spit you out of my mouth it's these dead zombies that no
[2:24:30.960 --> 2:24:34.600]  things are bad they don't respect themselves they don't have a sense of
[2:24:34.600 --> 2:24:39.040]  wanting to do evil or good but just sitting there like blobs well you asked
[2:24:39.040 --> 2:24:42.360]  a question before the break you said why does God hate the lukewarm more than
[2:24:42.360 --> 2:24:46.200]  the than the lost people well the truth of it is it's it's very simple to
[2:24:46.200 --> 2:24:51.040]  explain basically think about it in military terms for a second if a general
[2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:57.240]  commander of an army says to a Navy seal he says here's the mission I need you to
[2:24:57.240 --> 2:25:01.240]  go in grab those hostages I need you to get them out but instead of obeying the
[2:25:01.240 --> 2:25:05.240]  commander he runs he hides and he doesn't do what he's been trained and
[2:25:05.240 --> 2:25:10.200]  commanded to do do you think that soldier when he returns is gonna get
[2:25:10.200 --> 2:25:14.640]  commended by his commander of course not his commander is gonna be furious with
[2:25:14.640 --> 2:25:17.640]  them because he gave him the tools he gave him the talent he gave him the
[2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:20.800]  training he gave him the resources he gave him everything he needed to do to
[2:25:20.800 --> 2:25:25.360]  accomplish the mission and the guy ran like a coward the lukewarm are like
[2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:29.360]  cowardly Christians basically and it's almost like if I you're right it's all
[2:25:29.360 --> 2:25:33.840]  about cowardice and God hates a coward well Revelation 21 7 says that cowardly
[2:25:33.840 --> 2:25:38.760]  will not inherit the kingdom of heaven and God's mind lying stealing lust all
[2:25:38.760 --> 2:25:43.080]  that stuff is just as bad as being a coward and you know it's kind of like
[2:25:43.080 --> 2:25:47.160]  this if I see you're in need right and I say Alex I'll help you with that need
[2:25:47.160 --> 2:25:51.720]  but then I don't do it right I disobey and I blow you off and I don't come and
[2:25:51.720 --> 2:25:55.840]  help you with the need which was worse for me to see the need and ignore it or
[2:25:55.840 --> 2:25:59.760]  to promise you all do some of the false the false claim of AIDS like a ship
[2:25:59.760 --> 2:26:02.760]  radios you when you're going down in five miles where we're coming to help you
[2:26:02.760 --> 2:26:05.920]  and doesn't come to help you right and then don't sweet you're gonna ignore a
[2:26:05.920 --> 2:26:09.480]  ship that needs help just ignore them right so here they are in church on
[2:26:09.480 --> 2:26:13.960]  Sunday singing songs oh god I love you I adore you I'll do anything for you isn't
[2:26:13.960 --> 2:26:17.280]  it like they're really being Pharisees though they want to be seen as good right
[2:26:17.280 --> 2:26:20.200]  in their community they don't want to actually do it I don't know I can't
[2:26:20.200 --> 2:26:23.520]  really speak some of them though I mean that because here's the deal I go to
[2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:27.080]  these big churches they're not preaching anything I heard when I was a kid
[2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:29.520]  everything I heard when I was a kid is coming true I go in there it's all feel
[2:26:29.520 --> 2:26:33.440]  good be happy that's not a church it's a pep rally well no exactly in other words
[2:26:33.440 --> 2:26:36.360]  it's a prosperity message in fact here we got a little bit of time let me share
[2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:40.040]  with you in analogy let's say this is the essence and what's wrong with the
[2:26:40.040 --> 2:26:44.600]  modern American gospel today okay let's say you got two passengers on an airplane
[2:26:44.600 --> 2:26:47.880]  and you go to the first one you say sir Alex put this parachute on because
[2:26:47.880 --> 2:26:51.080]  it's really gonna improve your flight you're gonna have peace and joy and
[2:26:51.080 --> 2:26:54.200]  happiness and man this is this this is gonna be the greatest flight of your
[2:26:54.200 --> 2:26:57.840]  life well you try the parachute on because you sure you'd love to have the
[2:26:57.840 --> 2:27:01.320]  greatest flight of your life and in experimental fashion you put the thing on
[2:27:01.320 --> 2:27:04.320]  but in a few minutes you notice the weight of the parachute on your back
[2:27:04.320 --> 2:27:08.720]  right it's cumbersome it's tight you can't lean back in your seat pretty soon
[2:27:08.720 --> 2:27:11.800]  you look around and there's other passengers mocking you making fun of you
[2:27:11.800 --> 2:27:16.200]  saying ah there's a word of parachute he doesn't need a parachute we're all okay
[2:27:16.200 --> 2:27:22.360]  we're safe right so pretty soon see get somewhat embittered towards those that
[2:27:22.360 --> 2:27:25.320]  told them to put the parachute on to improve his flight because it didn't
[2:27:25.320 --> 2:27:30.080]  improve his flight at all right but if I go to passenger two and I say sir put
[2:27:30.080 --> 2:27:33.960]  this pass and this parachute on because any minute you're gonna have to jump
[2:27:33.960 --> 2:27:38.040]  10,000 feet out of this plane in this parachute it's gonna save your life
[2:27:38.040 --> 2:27:42.120]  from the jump to cum now do they mind the weight of the parachute no no do they
[2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:45.720]  care they can't lean back in their seat no if other passengers start to mock and
[2:27:45.720 --> 2:27:48.880]  make fun of them they don't get embittered or indifferent towards those
[2:27:48.880 --> 2:27:52.200]  other passengers or towards those that gave him the parachute they have heart
[2:27:52.200 --> 2:27:55.640]  felt sympathy towards those people without the parachute because they know
[2:27:55.640 --> 2:27:59.920]  what their fate is gonna be when they have to jump 10,000 feet out of the
[2:27:59.920 --> 2:28:04.000]  plane without one and in the same way if people were true faithful witnesses to
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  what the Bible actually teaches they wouldn't say put Jesus on because he'll
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:12.280]  improve your life he'll give you health wealth and prosperity and all these
[2:28:12.280 --> 2:28:15.320]  wonderful things because Jesus didn't promise that he said becoming a
[2:28:15.320 --> 2:28:18.000]  Christian is gonna make your life tougher people are gonna hate you gonna
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:21.120]  mock you they're gonna revive you if they hated me they're gonna hate you too
[2:28:21.120 --> 2:28:25.080]  right they hate remember they hated me first in this world you will have
[2:28:25.080 --> 2:28:29.880]  tribulation but take heart I've overcome the world see the true believer he puts
[2:28:29.880 --> 2:28:33.800]  his faith and trust in the parachute because he knows it's gonna save him
[2:28:33.800 --> 2:28:38.760]  when he jumps from here into eternity he put it on for the motive to escape from
[2:28:38.760 --> 2:28:41.760]  the jump to come and again there is passage it's about if you do the right
[2:28:41.760 --> 2:28:44.240]  thing and follow the rule especially Old Testament you'll live a better life
[2:28:44.240 --> 2:28:47.480]  that's all true but you'll be attacked by the world so they take that and they
[2:28:47.480 --> 2:28:51.280]  twist that and then Christians expect to never face any opposition because they
[2:28:51.280 --> 2:28:54.440]  go to the megachurch but that's just not true you're supposed to get charged up
[2:28:54.440 --> 2:28:58.760]  like the Revolutionary War the Black Brigade the pastors led that war against
[2:28:58.760 --> 2:29:02.600]  the King no King but King Jesus and so the entire history of Christianity and
[2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:07.080]  it is about people standing up the number one place to recruit in the
[2:29:07.080 --> 2:29:11.680]  Revolutionary War was where church and the church right pastors would recruit
[2:29:11.680 --> 2:29:14.880]  their flocks and say hey we got to go fight for freedom and liberty and we
[2:29:14.880 --> 2:29:18.480]  got to fight for the future of our kids and yet you would not hear that preached
[2:29:18.480 --> 2:29:21.640]  anywhere from the pulpit today they all got duped and bought into the whole
[2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:25.960]  father 1c3 thing years ago even though right there on the IRS's website it
[2:29:25.960 --> 2:29:30.240]  says churches are automatically exempt they and the Romans 13 with Hitler's
[2:29:30.240 --> 2:29:33.960]  favorite quote right but but if you read the whole thing anymore it says no
[2:29:33.960 --> 2:29:37.800]  that's Caesar's currency in his system if you're in their system that's what
[2:29:37.800 --> 2:29:41.800]  you've got to submit to but under the First Amendment the church is separate
[2:29:41.800 --> 2:29:44.520]  from government and has no jurisdiction because those are the things of Christ
[2:29:44.520 --> 2:29:47.400]  that's absolutely right in other words you can't have you can't cut it both
[2:29:47.400 --> 2:29:50.640]  ways you can't say oh you can't have the church in the government you got to have
[2:29:50.640 --> 2:29:54.680]  separation church and state which really isn't even in the Constitution but they
[2:29:54.680 --> 2:29:57.680]  can't then come into the church and say oh well we're gonna tell you how to run
[2:29:57.680 --> 2:30:00.920]  church well they twisted and say God can't be in government no no it's the
[2:30:00.920 --> 2:30:04.000]  other way around government can't come in and tell churches what to do because
[2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:07.400]  it's not their jurisdiction right but they did they did Nixon did it with the
[2:30:07.400 --> 2:30:09.960]  and that's what it all happened and that's now the churches are all scared
[2:30:09.960 --> 2:30:14.760]  about their tax exemption just like the NRA right now and it's not just that
[2:30:14.760 --> 2:30:19.440]  Alex that we talked about the lukewarm okay the reason God hates the lukewarm
[2:30:19.440 --> 2:30:23.840]  is because they've said God the Bible says search is to and fro for that
[2:30:23.840 --> 2:30:28.280]  person that'll raise their hand and say here I am sinned me right I volunteer
[2:30:28.280 --> 2:30:33.280]  for God's army I volunteer for truth I volunteer for liberty I volunteer on the
[2:30:33.280 --> 2:30:37.960]  front line to be and do whatever you call me to be and do and yet they say
[2:30:37.960 --> 2:30:40.880]  those things they make those promises that they don't do it well there's other
[2:30:40.880 --> 2:30:44.440]  things the people that and again I don't come I am a Christian but for me it's
[2:30:44.440 --> 2:30:48.320]  just been like the spirit of it I'm so empowered when I'm doing what God wants
[2:30:48.320 --> 2:30:51.840]  it's a high that's incredible I can't and before I was really doing what God
[2:30:51.840 --> 2:30:55.720]  wanted me to I was not a happy person people don't understand the empowerment
[2:30:55.720 --> 2:30:59.120]  of getting with what God wants and it's not running around talking about what a
[2:30:59.120 --> 2:31:02.200]  good Christian you are it's going on confronting evil confronting the
[2:31:02.200 --> 2:31:05.680]  Satanist confronting their works and warning people I don't know how anybody
[2:31:05.680 --> 2:31:09.800]  now with Satanism as the world government open attacks on Christianity a
[2:31:09.800 --> 2:31:14.520]  mark of the beast one world government it's all happening exactly as the Bible
[2:31:14.520 --> 2:31:18.560]  says I mean I don't know how anyone could not now go whoa and then you think
[2:31:18.560 --> 2:31:22.960]  about a fallen one on the planet and trying to get rid of humanity I mean it's
[2:31:22.960 --> 2:31:27.320]  science fiction but it's not it's real no it's happening right now in fact every
[2:31:27.320 --> 2:31:32.040]  day I don't know when Christ comes back okay I don't know the day or the hour
[2:31:32.040 --> 2:31:35.800]  the scripture makes that clear but I can tell you one thing 100% for sure we're
[2:31:35.800 --> 2:31:40.040]  closer today than we were yesterday and not as close as we will be tomorrow it's
[2:31:40.040 --> 2:31:44.280]  imminent and as we see the science it's accelerating it's accelerating it's
[2:31:44.280 --> 2:31:49.240]  getting faster Daniel said in the last marriage right many people will run to
[2:31:49.240 --> 2:31:53.560]  and fro right and knowledge shall be greatly increased well that in the
[2:31:53.560 --> 2:31:57.640]  original Hebrew that to and fro means that things gonna speed up it's gonna
[2:31:57.640 --> 2:32:01.440]  come much harder and much faster Jesus equated it to labor planes on a woman
[2:32:01.440 --> 2:32:05.760]  right and anybody that's ever had a kid or been with her wife that has a kid you
[2:32:05.760 --> 2:32:09.560]  see those labor pains get more intense and they come quicker and in more
[2:32:09.560 --> 2:32:14.200]  painful and yet there's a climax use one thing that keeps that woman going right
[2:32:14.200 --> 2:32:19.800]  when she's so worn out she's so tired it might be 10 12 15 hours in labor that
[2:32:19.800 --> 2:32:23.560]  pain is so intense that you can't take it anymore there's one thought that keeps
[2:32:23.560 --> 2:32:27.800]  her going do you know what it is what do you think it is the baby right the meat
[2:32:27.800 --> 2:32:30.200]  and her baby and I think what's wrong with a modern
[2:32:30.200 --> 2:32:34.720]  Christian or even Americans is they're not ready to meet their maker see all
[2:32:34.720 --> 2:32:37.640]  my Christian life people would say Darryl you're so on fire for God you love
[2:32:37.640 --> 2:32:41.520]  the Lord you know the Bible what's the secret give me some quick tips I'd say
[2:32:41.520 --> 2:32:45.840]  well know your maker you know read the Bible pray you know fellowship with
[2:32:45.840 --> 2:32:49.480]  other believers etc know your maker and then make your maker known but I
[2:32:49.480 --> 2:32:52.680]  realized there was a third part that wasn't that was missing in these times
[2:32:52.680 --> 2:32:56.120]  that we're living in these turbulent times these difficult days I realize
[2:32:56.120 --> 2:33:00.720]  it's about meeting your maker to all throughout scripture you see examples
[2:33:00.720 --> 2:33:05.440]  Jesus gives about being ready to meet your maker being ready for these days
[2:33:05.440 --> 2:33:08.320]  you don't have to be afraid you don't have to well I've said that on there I
[2:33:08.320 --> 2:33:11.600]  go I'm ready to meet my maker they go Jones is suicidal no the opposite but
[2:33:11.600 --> 2:33:15.440]  I'm ready I'm ready right now put it under my head deny Christ or serve Satan I
[2:33:15.440 --> 2:33:19.160]  say pull the trigger I'm not scared I'm ready that's right and so I can they
[2:33:19.160 --> 2:33:22.600]  hate the fact that they don't have that fear of them right see that's that fear
[2:33:22.600 --> 2:33:25.840]  of not the world but of God and you're ready to meet your maker because you're
[2:33:25.840 --> 2:33:29.440]  on the right terms you're on the right team you've accepted crisis payment
[2:33:29.440 --> 2:33:32.680]  for your sin you're not count on your own good works your own good deeds if
[2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:36.120]  anybody could pile up all these good things all these things they've done
[2:33:36.120 --> 2:33:40.240]  and counting tooth or unhorned would be you but you don't we'll be back with

[2:35:50.960 --> 2:35:54.760]  you can wear them out to political events you can trigger it live darts but
[2:35:54.760 --> 2:35:59.680]  one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume
[2:35:59.680 --> 2:36:05.000]  party or at Halloween but on top of that they admit that wearing these masks
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:08.280]  does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else it's
[2:36:08.280 --> 2:36:11.280]  total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared for the force in
[2:36:11.280 --> 2:36:15.440]  occupations and contact tracing of their openly announcing it's an active
[2:36:15.440 --> 2:36:20.120]  submission it's an act of like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down but
[2:36:20.120 --> 2:36:23.800]  a big reason to wear these is then in the stores when people ask you why you're
[2:36:23.800 --> 2:36:28.400]  wearing a Halloween mask say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth masks that
[2:36:28.400 --> 2:36:33.080]  you're wearing and the M95 mask only control what's coming in not what's
[2:36:33.080 --> 2:36:37.560]  going out so they quote spread COVID-19 they don't protect from it so again it's
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:40.880]  a great way to throw it back at these control freaks faces you buy one for
[2:36:40.880 --> 2:36:46.840]  995 you get four more free they're at cost infowarstore.com a lot of you are
[2:36:46.840 --> 2:36:50.640]  probably already very familiar with these terms about to introduce but some
[2:36:50.640 --> 2:36:56.960]  folks are so those that aren't here they are activated charcoal and then another
[2:36:56.960 --> 2:37:05.640]  term enamel safe activated charcoal is the fastest growing type of toothpaste
[2:37:05.640 --> 2:37:09.240]  for a good reason it really really works well we've come up with the best
[2:37:09.240 --> 2:37:13.360]  activated charcoal toothpaste with no fillers the cleanest type highest
[2:37:13.360 --> 2:37:16.600]  quality with a bunch of high-quality and central oils and other ingredients
[2:37:16.600 --> 2:37:21.240]  known and documented to do amazing things for your oral hygiene and your
[2:37:21.240 --> 2:37:24.960]  overall health in your mouth that's so critical and it makes your teeth look
[2:37:24.960 --> 2:37:28.920]  really white and really really clean and it's good for your gums but on top of
[2:37:28.920 --> 2:37:33.200]  that it doesn't have any ingredients that are known to hurt enamel I've gone
[2:37:33.200 --> 2:37:37.160]  up before got toothpaste that really made my teeth clean but eroded enamel up
[2:37:37.160 --> 2:37:41.880]  the top so I got into really safe healthy types of toothpaste and that's
[2:37:41.880 --> 2:37:47.400]  what this is it's available at infowarstore.com
[2:37:47.400 --> 2:37:57.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:38:06.200 --> 2:38:09.360]  all right daryl run this is in studio with us I want to jam in a few your
[2:38:09.360 --> 2:38:12.720]  balls as promised but you've got something fun you invented and we're
[2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:15.840]  gonna plug it here right now butterflyers.com
[2:38:15.840 --> 2:38:20.960]  I want you to plug it. We have all kinds of designs probably 50
[2:38:20.960 --> 2:38:23.560]  different designs some that just look like butterflies some that say happy
[2:38:23.560 --> 2:38:27.640]  birthday or merry Christmas or what have you but this is a new way to figure
[2:38:27.640 --> 2:38:31.400]  to bring the American flag patriotic kind of thing but people love them and
[2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:35.280]  we say fly it forward because right now especially with a lot of people not
[2:38:35.280 --> 2:38:39.840]  going to birthday parties or graduations or weddings or what have you they
[2:38:39.840 --> 2:38:43.400]  want to send a card and so they want something special to put in that card and
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:48.080]  that's what we made these to do you wind them up about 30 35 times put them in a
[2:38:48.080 --> 2:38:53.240]  book magazine greeting cord whatever you want and then when people open it up it
[2:38:53.240 --> 2:38:57.440]  comes flying out and it's they first it's like a kid ride and rollercoaster
[2:38:57.440 --> 2:39:00.760]  first they scream then they laugh and then they wind it back up and say let's
[2:39:00.760 --> 2:39:03.720]  do it again one more of those or I guess we grab it on the floor no me my kids
[2:39:03.720 --> 2:39:07.840]  love these one for you and one for the wife and so you and us a big purple one
[2:39:07.840 --> 2:39:12.680]  that's a purple one and and other just a lot of fun very simple very easy to use
[2:39:12.680 --> 2:39:16.280]  a very interesting concept and you invented this right but there's well
[2:39:16.280 --> 2:39:20.200]  these are our designs actually the inventor is about a hundred he was about
[2:39:20.200 --> 2:39:24.640]  a hundred years ago as a magician who made one out of wire and paper in a
[2:39:24.640 --> 2:39:28.120]  rubber band and that's another thing people love about them no batteries
[2:39:28.120 --> 2:39:31.960]  required it's very low old-fashioned toy fashion it's a lot of fun you could use
[2:39:31.960 --> 2:39:35.680]  them over and over again grandparents are going crazy for kid with their kids
[2:39:35.680 --> 2:39:38.680]  with their grandkids for this and we need to get back to writing handwritten
[2:39:38.680 --> 2:39:42.200]  letters and we need to get back to I mean more more landlines because all of the
[2:39:42.200 --> 2:39:46.160]  new technologies being used to totally dehumanize us and make us obsolete that's
[2:39:46.160 --> 2:39:53.240]  why before we go to calls I wanted to bring this up I was out at Crater Park
[2:39:53.240 --> 2:40:01.000]  Crater Monument in Arizona I guess about 15 years ago now and this thing was
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:04.760]  only like 600 bucks I later looked and they're like going for like 5,000 now
[2:40:04.760 --> 2:40:10.280]  it's out of Morocco it's a prehistoric crocodile and they had you know stuff for
[2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:14.680]  sale there so I got this now I don't know what the main line preachers how old
[2:40:14.680 --> 2:40:17.080]  they say the earth is that sort of traditional Bible but obviously they
[2:40:17.080 --> 2:40:20.040]  now admitted the universe is younger than what they thought now they think
[2:40:20.040 --> 2:40:23.600]  asteroid status every hundred thousand years big ones on every 15 million their
[2:40:23.600 --> 2:40:26.960]  science is all changed and stuff's getting crazier and crazier they were
[2:40:26.960 --> 2:40:30.800]  trying to unspiral DNA in the lab thought it would break new DNA just
[2:40:30.800 --> 2:40:35.800]  generates and it just keeps unspiraling turns out all that junk isn't junk and
[2:40:35.800 --> 2:40:40.480]  they've gone in there and they find like whole species and things they've never
[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:45.400]  even been here or they didn't know about in us and other animals like ferrets
[2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:49.360]  get given this new vaccine they die we don't die I mean we're so tough people
[2:40:49.360 --> 2:40:52.640]  don't realize how amazing humans are and there's just something special about us
[2:40:52.640 --> 2:40:56.680]  because God made us but just think about the old earth age and what was here
[2:40:56.680 --> 2:41:01.960]  before and just you know what what really went on on this planet you know I
[2:41:01.960 --> 2:41:07.920]  would say that's pre-flood and I'm a I'm a young earth guy you know I've done a
[2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:11.920]  lot of research a lot of studying on this and the fact that just recently I'm
[2:41:11.920 --> 2:41:16.280]  gonna say recently maybe about four or five years ago they found DNA in
[2:41:16.280 --> 2:41:21.320]  dinosaur tissue I remember and so how is there 45 million old right you can't
[2:41:21.320 --> 2:41:24.520]  be right they just wouldn't survive that long so that the simple fact is the
[2:41:24.520 --> 2:41:28.840]  Bible if you go read the book of Job describes bohemus you know this animal
[2:41:28.840 --> 2:41:33.400]  with the tea is a tail as big as a cedar tree and of course in the biblical
[2:41:33.400 --> 2:41:36.680]  commentary is say oh that's probably an elephant well have you ever seen the tail
[2:41:36.680 --> 2:41:40.180]  on an elephant a little bit right yeah so it's not a big long tail like a
[2:41:40.180 --> 2:41:45.040]  tiny tail right you you have legends of dragons and dinosaurs and every culture
[2:41:45.040 --> 2:41:49.520]  all over the world so and the Chinese say in their 5,000
[2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:52.840]  writings that just right before that that there were these big dragons
[2:41:52.840 --> 2:41:57.040]  everywhere and now China has more bones of all these dinosaurs I mean just
[2:41:57.040 --> 2:42:01.440]  north here well about an hour and Glenn Rose right you got the footprints of men
[2:42:01.440 --> 2:42:06.040]  and dinosaurs side by side true limestone so I mean how would that happen if
[2:42:06.040 --> 2:42:09.600]  dinosaurs were billions of years old so all I know is I don't get into the
[2:42:09.600 --> 2:42:12.680]  debate because they try to set science against you know Christians and then
[2:42:12.680 --> 2:42:15.880]  some of the pastors have their own theories all I know is they're constantly
[2:42:15.880 --> 2:42:20.080]  revising the universe and now they're going okay all of our spectrometers show
[2:42:20.080 --> 2:42:23.920]  that our universe is held in power by something five times stronger and now
[2:42:23.920 --> 2:42:27.400]  they're like okay it's a simulation and okay let's break out of it so they're
[2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:30.880]  actually now like Lucifer saying I'm breaking out of this simulation I want
[2:42:30.880 --> 2:42:33.520]  my own reality I mean the pop scientists the billionaires the head of Bank of
[2:42:33.520 --> 2:42:37.600]  America says we're held in here by some slave master we've scanned it it's fake
[2:42:37.600 --> 2:42:41.120]  well see so they're right back to Lucifer saying come with me we're gonna
[2:42:41.120 --> 2:42:44.440]  create our new reality in silicon merge with machines we're gonna make you God
[2:42:44.440 --> 2:42:48.160]  think about CERN right they knew they tapped into something when they when
[2:42:48.160 --> 2:42:52.440]  they turned on a little radar and it opened up a new portal to a new
[2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:56.680]  dimension and something demonic came out if you've ever never checked into CERN
[2:42:56.680 --> 2:43:01.160]  do your research oh that was on the news that was just horrible yeah I mean they
[2:43:01.160 --> 2:43:05.360]  they're demonic I mean they are dancing around to Sheba and they have all these
[2:43:05.360 --> 2:43:09.360]  weird demonic moves and they're praising they wearing druid robes minded me of
[2:43:09.360 --> 2:43:13.560]  when you broke into the Bohemian Grove I mean that that's the thing we all are
[2:43:13.560 --> 2:43:16.960]  told oh atheists there's no God all the elites are totally into the ancient
[2:43:16.960 --> 2:43:19.760]  occult stuff no they know because something was broken through then no the
[2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:24.160]  thing is it's like a Lester Crowley once said okay he's like I have no problem
[2:43:24.160 --> 2:43:27.880]  with my Plymouth brethren Christians right he says I can't perceive of a
[2:43:27.880 --> 2:43:32.680]  generation that wouldn't believe in God I just chose to serve the other side all
[2:43:32.680 --> 2:43:36.840]  the illuminous all the powerful politician the elitist they believe in
[2:43:36.840 --> 2:43:40.160]  God they know there's a God they just choose to serve Satan they want their
[2:43:40.160 --> 2:43:43.720]  power now so therefore they sacrifice those children that's why they're
[2:43:43.720 --> 2:43:47.600]  pedophiles that's why they love their adrenal gland and drinking blood and
[2:43:47.600 --> 2:43:51.080]  doing all these things because they're drunk on power that's what they want but
[2:43:51.080 --> 2:43:55.040]  the revelation it says the horror Babylon drunk on the blood of Saints right in
[2:43:55.040 --> 2:43:59.120]  fact that original Greek word of Saint there isn't Saint like Christian it
[2:43:59.120 --> 2:44:04.240]  means the innocent innocent children so I believe honestly drunk on the blood of
[2:44:04.240 --> 2:44:09.920]  children I believe mystery Babylon is America I believe that's what John saw I
[2:44:09.920 --> 2:44:13.960]  think that's what God was revealing destroyed right if you yeah in a day it
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:17.240]  will come to not but I think that's after we're we're out of here those that are
[2:44:17.240 --> 2:44:21.600]  getting on the arc so to speak in that is found in Christ salvation only through
[2:44:21.600 --> 2:44:27.600]  Christ will escape that not tribulation but the wrath of God in fact the time is
[2:44:27.600 --> 2:44:32.720]  coming when God will pour out his bowls of wrath and it'll be so bad so bad that
[2:44:32.720 --> 2:44:36.560]  the Spirit of God tells the angel to herald to the world blessed are those
[2:44:36.560 --> 2:44:41.080]  who die from this point forward that are in Christ because it would be better to
[2:44:41.080 --> 2:44:47.600]  die in Christ than to deal with a wrath of God on an unbelieving world and how
[2:44:47.600 --> 2:44:52.080]  many people get killed all well almost all of them eventually are going to be
[2:44:52.080 --> 2:44:56.440]  cast into the lake of fire but those that have not escaped I mean most of those
[2:44:56.440 --> 2:44:59.840]  people are still gonna a lot of people gonna get saved a lot of people are
[2:44:59.840 --> 2:45:03.240]  gonna realize they missed the boat literally and figuratively and then
[2:45:03.240 --> 2:45:06.000]  they're gonna come to Christ unfortunately they'll have hell on earth to
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:09.240]  deal with for seven years they're gonna have to deal with the antichrist and
[2:45:09.240 --> 2:45:12.880]  dodge and take in the mark and not being able to buy or sell without taking the
[2:45:12.880 --> 2:45:16.880]  mark and so on and so forth so it's gonna be hell on earth but those that
[2:45:16.880 --> 2:45:20.600]  stand firm to the end will be saved and then Christ will come back you'll set up
[2:45:20.600 --> 2:45:24.280]  his kingdom he'll set everything right and things will be great again for at
[2:45:24.280 --> 2:45:27.920]  least a thousand years and then for some reason Bible doesn't say Satan gets
[2:45:27.920 --> 2:45:32.160]  loosed from the pits of hell and he starts to run amok again and but God's
[2:45:32.160 --> 2:45:36.960]  God's cast him and all the rest of those that whose names weren't in the book of
[2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:41.280]  life back into the lake of fire and forever and ever and ever so you know I
[2:45:41.280 --> 2:45:47.320]  personally I always looked at it is Pascal Pascal's wager right his wager was
[2:45:47.320 --> 2:45:51.640]  simple like this if you are a Christian you got nothing to fear nothing to worry
[2:45:51.640 --> 2:45:54.200]  about but if you're not you got everything in the world to worry about
[2:45:54.200 --> 2:45:58.240]  well listen Larry Nichols knew the killer very very well ran them first for
[2:45:58.240 --> 2:46:00.760]  governor was there but when they sort of killing kids he couldn't be part of it
[2:46:00.760 --> 2:46:05.040]  and he she would go to satanic rituals and other things they should also go to
[2:46:05.040 --> 2:46:08.960]  Native American rituals and church and he said what are you doing as he said
[2:46:08.960 --> 2:46:14.120]  I'm hedging my bets so she was literally right that's how whacked out she is right
[2:46:14.120 --> 2:46:18.480]  she I mean yeah but of course God's not mocked he's not fooled he you can't play
[2:46:18.480 --> 2:46:21.600]  both sides of the fence you can't be lukewarm you can't be well what does that
[2:46:21.600 --> 2:46:24.880]  say about Hillary what what what what can you know what what fellowship can
[2:46:24.880 --> 2:46:28.640]  light have with darkness right what can oil do with water they can't mix and I
[2:46:28.640 --> 2:46:31.800]  suppose if I was gonna serve Satan I wouldn't just go so I'd serve Satan
[2:46:31.800 --> 2:46:35.680]  let's just serve God I'll serve God I think I can serve both well I think it's
[2:46:35.680 --> 2:46:39.880]  the old like what we need to do is patriots is no thy enemy so I think you
[2:46:39.880 --> 2:46:42.960]  go to church just to know what the enemy is up to and to try to infiltrate the
[2:46:42.960 --> 2:46:47.440]  church the number one warning sign about the end times isn't earthquakes
[2:46:47.440 --> 2:46:50.720]  pestilence family the church has been captured it's false prophets false
[2:46:50.720 --> 2:46:55.000]  teachers false Christians wolves and sheeps clothing over and over and over
[2:46:55.000 --> 2:47:00.880]  Jesus warned about that in fact in the in Matthew 24 and 25 he only talks one
[2:47:00.880 --> 2:47:04.120]  time about earthquakes and pestilence and famines and wars and rumors of wars
[2:47:04.120 --> 2:47:08.200]  but ten times he talks about wolves and sheeps clothing you know that and be
[2:47:08.200 --> 2:47:11.320]  careful he's fax he starts off be careful no one to see you many will come
[2:47:11.320 --> 2:47:14.880]  in my name claiming I'm a Christian or I'm a I'm a Christ don't believe them
[2:47:14.880 --> 2:47:17.800]  right they'll always tell you it's their little special way of doing it and
[2:47:17.800 --> 2:47:21.280]  you've got a you know God's into relationship he did it's not about rules
[2:47:21.280 --> 2:47:24.160]  it's not about regulations now you don't need that priest in between you and
[2:47:24.160 --> 2:47:28.520]  God no there is one meteor between God and man and that's Christ Jesus and so
[2:47:28.520 --> 2:47:32.360]  that's why God Christ is the is the door all right he's the gateway he's the
[2:47:32.360 --> 2:47:36.680]  only perfect sinless one God made him who knew no sin sin for us that we may be
[2:47:36.680 --> 2:47:40.080]  made the righteousness of Christ it's really just that simple and put it this
[2:47:40.080 --> 2:47:43.880]  way who out there can say they've never told a lie you ever tell a lie yeah I've
[2:47:43.880 --> 2:47:47.400]  told plenty of you were stolen yes and even piece of candy as a kid right
[2:47:47.400 --> 2:47:50.600]  Jesus says if you look at a woman and you lust after her you've already come
[2:47:50.600 --> 2:47:53.600]  it's been like when I lost after beating people's brains out so those are
[2:47:53.600 --> 2:47:57.320]  commandments from God wrote them on our hearts he gave us a conscience to bear
[2:47:57.320 --> 2:48:00.840]  witness no man can say it I didn't know it was wrong that's the knowledge of
[2:48:00.840 --> 2:48:04.000]  evil because I can tune in to have the enemy thinks what they're doing and it
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:08.160]  is like even the ability to do that is a sin right now let me get through to the
[2:48:08.160 --> 2:48:11.320]  other side though so the point is we all know right from wrong we all know
[2:48:11.320 --> 2:48:15.800]  what a sin is our conscience bears witness make the word con science with
[2:48:15.800 --> 2:48:21.400]  knowledge okay but we broke the law but Jesus stepped in and paid the fine he
[2:48:21.400 --> 2:48:25.040]  set us free it's like being before the judge and oh and a million bucks and
[2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:27.960]  then the guy steps in and says here judge I'll pay the fine we got to go to
[2:48:27.960 --> 2:48:31.160]  these calls but you're on fire they'll run this is our guest info wars dot com
[2:48:31.160 --> 2:48:37.280]  news wars dot com butterflyers dot com Americans have had freedom for so long
[2:48:37.280 --> 2:48:42.680]  and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of
[2:48:42.680 --> 2:48:46.960]  history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny we don't appreciate the

[2:48:58.720 --> 2:49:02.480]  five hundred years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in
[2:49:02.480 --> 2:49:06.720]  humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the
[2:49:06.720 --> 2:49:11.080]  West invented and that's what made our modern world that's now been hijacked by
[2:49:11.080 --> 2:49:15.000]  the technocrats by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:19.640]  earth and we need to be called and dumbed down and put into subgroups that
[2:49:19.640 --> 2:49:23.880]  the elites dominate manipulate and command even lucky enough to stay alive
[2:49:23.880 --> 2:49:30.000]  and that's what covered 19 is a global you in revolution against free humanity

[2:49:33.240 --> 2:49:38.200]  stand up and fight you deserve what you get it was in the telecommunications act
[2:49:38.200 --> 2:49:44.200]  of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location I read from the
[2:49:44.200 --> 2:49:48.400]  federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American
[2:49:48.400 --> 2:49:53.520]  now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple
[2:49:53.520 --> 2:49:58.040]  and on droids don't just track your location but your surfing history where
[2:49:58.040 --> 2:50:03.160]  you go who you talk to your relationships and they all share the data with
[2:50:03.160 --> 2:50:07.360]  each other of what you're doing on the apps as well including having apps turn
[2:50:07.360 --> 2:50:12.520]  on and listen to what you're saying just like Siri or Alexa do and then putting
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:17.440]  databases transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved
[2:50:17.440 --> 2:50:21.160]  forever your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret

[2:50:38.800 --> 2:50:48.440]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show if you've observed we are drugged out
[2:50:48.440 --> 2:50:55.880]  we are following other people's opinions we are controlled by the media today it
[2:50:55.880 --> 2:51:01.360]  all changes this reality has been forced upon us it is a choice just like when I
[2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:05.480]  said slavery is a choice Einstein says the definition of insanity is doing the
[2:51:05.480 --> 2:51:09.120]  same thing expecting a different result so we keep on saying I hate you I hate
[2:51:09.120 --> 2:51:13.280]  you fuck you fuck you how are we gonna get a different result out of hate why
[2:51:13.280 --> 2:51:19.440]  don't we just try love why don't we just try love we have the resources for a
[2:51:19.440 --> 2:51:25.040]  peaceful world you know sometimes you need some crazy mother to change something
[2:51:25.040 --> 2:51:29.200]  Steve Jobs is crazy now we all know Steve Jobs phones they say trucks great
[2:51:29.200 --> 2:51:34.400]  they say I'm crazy but I'm here to show love it's a bigger plan and I'm just
[2:51:34.400 --> 2:51:41.080]  doing what the universe told me. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to
[2:51:41.080 --> 2:51:48.640]  God it's Alex Jones. What do you think of Kanye West I think overall he's good
[2:51:48.640 --> 2:51:53.120]  he's attacking abortion he's attacking the Satanism of the world he's attacking
[2:51:53.120 --> 2:51:55.760]  censorship I see all these other Christians going oh well he's not
[2:51:55.760 --> 2:51:58.680]  perfect or he did this and that well I mean how are people ever gonna become
[2:51:58.680 --> 2:52:02.040]  Christians then if we all suffer like Pharisees it's like what they told
[2:52:02.040 --> 2:52:06.160]  Christ don't don't hang around with them you know it's so funny of course people
[2:52:06.160 --> 2:52:10.360]  always have their critics right but Jesus says if you really want to know if
[2:52:10.360 --> 2:52:13.720]  they're saved you'll know them by their fruit right what fruit is he talking
[2:52:13.720 --> 2:52:16.960]  about he's talking about the fruit of the spirit peace joy love gentleness
[2:52:16.960 --> 2:52:22.920]  self-control goodness and so much more so when I see Kanye giving up his wealth
[2:52:22.920 --> 2:52:27.480]  talking to his wife and saying honey you can't dress like that anymore you need
[2:52:27.480 --> 2:52:31.200]  to dress more modestly you know all these people are lusting after you or
[2:52:31.200 --> 2:52:35.320]  taking a stand against abortion or any of the other things he's doing I've got
[2:52:35.320 --> 2:52:40.200]  to say as a fruit inspector for God man he's legit he's the real deal God but
[2:52:40.200 --> 2:52:44.240]  you love God or money you can't serve both okay when anybody's but look how
[2:52:44.240 --> 2:52:47.440]  much we're passionate he looks now that's real that's real you can they're
[2:52:47.440 --> 2:52:51.840]  calling that mental illness see that's of course the world hates Christ and
[2:52:51.840 --> 2:52:55.320]  Christ in you right they call me all kinds of names you know but that's okay
[2:52:55.320 --> 2:52:58.280]  I don't worry about that I don't care what other people think I don't care
[2:52:58.280 --> 2:53:02.560]  what they say and that's the point I came to make today in a nutshell quit
[2:53:02.560 --> 2:53:06.000]  worrying about what other people are saying think about Jesus says why do
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:10.040]  you care about what men can do to you fear not those that can kill the body
[2:53:10.040 --> 2:53:13.760]  and after that do no more fear the one who can not only kill the body but have
[2:53:13.760 --> 2:53:18.360]  your soul cast into hell I tell you fear him there is no fear of God that's why
[2:53:18.360 --> 2:53:21.640]  they're not ready to meet their make and and this attitude of groveling has
[2:53:21.640 --> 2:53:26.800]  let Satan take over right absolutely all evil needs to prosper for good men
[2:53:26.800 --> 2:53:29.320]  well you can look at Kanye breaking down a crime that's the Holy Spirit right
[2:53:29.320 --> 2:53:32.880]  there absolutely and they're like oh I'm saying but people you know what all my
[2:53:32.880 --> 2:53:36.560]  friends cuz keep in mind most of my life I hated Christians okay I was not my dad
[2:53:36.560 --> 2:53:40.840]  was a fake Christian who was a pastor I grew up hating Christians I thought was
[2:53:40.840 --> 2:53:45.280]  he think well he got saved later in life after I got saved actually oh wow but
[2:53:45.280 --> 2:53:49.440]  yeah he was that he was he was a fake preacher in the pulpit he had it in the
[2:53:49.440 --> 2:53:52.760]  head but he didn't have it in the heart see the issue is it's a heart condition
[2:53:52.760 --> 2:53:55.560]  you can have it here all you want to see how all things work for the glory of God
[2:53:55.560 --> 2:53:59.080]  his fakeness made you not like it but then brought back and then you brought
[2:53:59.080 --> 2:54:03.160]  him back which then ultimately my friend you're like Luke Skywalker saving Darth
[2:54:03.160 --> 2:54:06.720]  Maynard exactly you know it's it's really cool how God does work everything
[2:54:06.720 --> 2:54:10.520]  together for good for those that love him and that are called according to his
[2:54:10.520 --> 2:54:14.440]  purpose but the the funny thing about that is all my old friends from high
[2:54:14.440 --> 2:54:18.000]  school that I used to the party with and get high with and you know go do all
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:21.440]  kinds of crazy things with before I was a Christian you know when God got out
[2:54:21.440 --> 2:54:26.160]  whole my heart he so radically changed me that when I talked to them they knew
[2:54:26.160 --> 2:54:29.480]  something had changed there was something different about me and their most
[2:54:29.480 --> 2:54:33.080]  common response was you're the last person I ever thought would become a
[2:54:33.080 --> 2:54:36.560]  Christian but I think God does that he takes it happened over time or like it
[2:54:36.560 --> 2:54:40.320]  in a moment was an instant God got a hole in my heart and radically changed it on
[2:54:40.320 --> 2:54:44.040]  the spot just like Kanye same thing you know just when you have like a solid
[2:54:44.040 --> 2:54:47.280]  upon experience you're on I was on the road to success last thing I was
[2:54:47.280 --> 2:54:51.040]  looking for was Jesus right well I was Christian but I was about I was about
[2:54:51.040 --> 2:54:56.480]  18 or 19 17 I'd gotten really radical and wild like 12 so I had hundreds of
[2:54:56.480 --> 2:54:59.840]  girlfriends and done all these fights and all this really I wasn't a Satanist
[2:54:59.840 --> 2:55:03.560]  consciously but I was to say what a vicious attacking but you know like what
[2:55:03.560 --> 2:55:06.680]  they want to say is to be what they think of one has not how the link you
[2:55:06.680 --> 2:55:09.080]  know shriveled person and then it was all said like God just sort of get hold
[2:55:09.080 --> 2:55:11.920]  me and like having dreams about the New World Order and the world government the
[2:55:11.920 --> 2:55:15.320]  evil and how bad it was for children and I really repented and got you know
[2:55:15.320 --> 2:55:18.800]  stopped dating and for a while and you know got better and then I was like
[2:55:18.800 --> 2:55:22.360]  basically like almost like a vision continually that I had to do this work
[2:55:22.360 --> 2:55:26.960]  well it was a process with me I think a lot of people look at you or maybe me or
[2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:31.200]  other Christians or Kanye as an example and they nitpick and they say oh well
[2:55:31.200 --> 2:55:35.560]  he did this oh I caught Alex swearing I caught Alex saying this or Alex played a
[2:55:35.560 --> 2:55:39.840]  Led Zeppelin song you know whatever it is but they don't understand the fruit
[2:55:39.840 --> 2:55:45.680]  there the problem with a right back 60 seconds I have never been so concerned
[2:55:45.680 --> 2:55:49.720]  about what's going on this is all martial law prepping martial law training
[2:55:49.720 --> 2:55:52.960]  and now they have activated the most criminal elements the deep state and

[2:56:02.200 --> 2:56:05.520]  impeachment but they're saying they're going to do it ladies and gentlemen they
[2:56:05.520 --> 2:56:09.800]  are putting this in every newspaper in the country and legitimizing the fact
[2:56:09.800 --> 2:56:13.000]  that if he can test the election in any way when they say by default they are
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:18.240]  but they're gonna pull this this is maximum maximum alert this is emergency
[2:56:18.240 --> 2:56:21.480]  alert yes they've censored the Patriots off most the internet but banned our
[2:56:21.480 --> 2:56:24.440]  video is still there the radio show is still there and yes we're getting about
[2:56:24.440 --> 2:56:28.160]  five times the traffic we were getting before the ban to the actual sites we
[2:56:28.160 --> 2:56:32.040]  need to get this message to other people outside of our audience so tell
[2:56:32.040 --> 2:56:35.920]  everyone now about the martial law plan and the plan to get rid of Trump it's
[2:56:35.920 --> 2:56:40.160]  all posted at banned hot video please we can defeat these people if you take
[2:56:40.160 --> 2:57:05.040]  action you are the answer please please please so there's there's the mentions
[2:57:05.040 --> 2:57:09.040]  we can't see it from that matter proven there are transmissions it's all out
[2:57:09.040 --> 2:57:13.160]  there in the universe we see a limited spectrum you were just talking about like
[2:57:13.160 --> 2:57:16.720]  a black Sabbath and even Ozzy Osbourne saying they wrote the whole album like
[2:57:16.720 --> 2:57:19.920]  in five minutes was all just downloaded it was a he said it was it was like
[2:57:19.920 --> 2:57:23.640]  somebody had already written it for him and so let's hey don't don't deceive
[2:57:23.640 --> 2:57:28.960]  yourself there is good there is evil but don't focus on the Christian you know
[2:57:28.960 --> 2:57:33.600]  be a Kanye or Darrell or Alex or whatever focus on Christ Christians are
[2:57:33.600 --> 2:57:37.760]  imperfect that's why we need Christ we're not the perfect one God there's only one
[2:57:37.760 --> 2:57:41.280]  perfect person ever met and his name is Jesus Christ it's not Darrell run this
[2:57:41.280 --> 2:57:45.840]  it's not Alex we're gonna make mistakes we're not better we're just better off
[2:57:45.840 --> 2:57:49.760]  because we've received the pardon that God offers through Christ and the work
[2:57:49.760 --> 2:57:53.640]  that he did on the cross but hey before we go because I know we all take a few
[2:57:53.640 --> 2:57:57.600]  calls you guys are gonna kill me yeah I just really want to emphasize this one
[2:57:57.600 --> 2:58:02.960]  point and that is are you the next Alex Jones how about you what's God calling
[2:58:02.960 --> 2:58:06.140]  you to do when he comes back are you ready to meet your maker is he gonna
[2:58:06.140 --> 2:58:10.240]  find you doing what he's commanded you to do well that's why they demonize and
[2:58:10.240 --> 2:58:13.080]  try to make me look like a loser because they want to scare other people to not
[2:58:13.080 --> 2:58:17.280]  do what I've done it's been an honor to be attacked and demonize and I shake 50
[2:58:17.280 --> 2:58:20.640]  hands for everybody that you know spit set me so so there's also you know the
[2:58:20.640 --> 2:58:24.040]  blessings of standing up to evil as well well go read the Declaration of
[2:58:24.040 --> 2:58:27.760]  Independence and look at the grievances that are listed there and then look at
[2:58:27.760 --> 2:58:32.040]  what we're dealing with today and ask yourself how is it we got so tolerant how
[2:58:32.040 --> 2:58:35.720]  is it that we'll put up with a previous president spying on a sitting
[2:58:35.720 --> 2:58:42.280]  president and calling in all kinds of FBI agents and false doctrines and and you
[2:58:42.280 --> 2:58:46.440]  know evidence in in FISA court warrants and all that other stuff to spy on an
[2:58:46.440 --> 2:58:53.880]  existing president and we put up with it back in the day man I tell you if if
[2:58:53.880 --> 2:58:57.480]  Adams would have done that to Washington after Washington left office
[2:58:57.480 --> 2:59:02.040]  he'd have been hung as a yes the first edition and for treason there would have
[2:59:02.040 --> 2:59:05.360]  been no that's true and that's why Leticia James is now basically to shut the
[2:59:05.360 --> 2:59:08.760]  NRA down because they've just gotten away with murder but that's because we're
[2:59:08.760 --> 2:59:12.720]  not doing anything what are we doing see Alex is one man he's got one bullhorn
[2:59:12.720 --> 2:59:16.600]  and he took on the whole new world order all our listeners back this is they
[2:59:16.600 --> 2:59:19.640]  really did I know that I think that's why I don't want the credit but because
[2:59:19.640 --> 2:59:22.920]  it was really the listeners that did it well exactly and then it just goes to
[2:59:22.920 --> 2:59:26.240]  show you're a listener that supported us like more I mean I can only do so much
[2:59:26.240 --> 2:59:29.440]  you can only do so much we need those other people that are sitting at home
[2:59:29.440 --> 2:59:34.160]  calorie and fear don't fear men what's the worst they can do to you because if
[2:59:34.160 --> 2:59:37.680]  you think you're hanging on to your wealth and your prosperity your job and
[2:59:37.680 --> 2:59:42.240]  your house guess what it's all gone it's gone if you don't get up and go out and
[2:59:42.240 --> 2:59:45.720]  start doing something if you don't pray that I think this audience gets that they
[2:59:45.720 --> 2:59:48.800]  need to go to other people that Renaissance in New York thanks for
[2:59:48.800 --> 2:59:52.680]  holding you're on the air welcome hey Alex good to talk to you thanks for
[2:59:52.680 --> 2:59:59.360]  holding brother no problem no problem so yeah as far as the protest go you know
[2:59:59.360 --> 3:00:07.520]  we'll have a protest but conserving to what these lunatics do we don't stay so
[3:00:07.520 --> 3:00:11.920]  you know to hold the protest whether it's DC whether it's at any given
[3:00:11.920 --> 3:00:18.920]  capital basically occupied obviously don't go crazy and burn stuff but stay
[3:00:18.920 --> 3:00:21.880]  there no I agree it's time for civil disobedience we should just do every
[3:00:21.880 --> 3:00:25.240]  show about this for the next what do we well let me ask you listen Renaissance
[3:00:25.240 --> 3:00:29.520]  man what I agree I'm ready to start getting arrested I'm ready to start
[3:00:29.520 --> 3:00:32.640]  civil disobedience I'm starting to ready to get myself chained to something
[3:00:32.640 --> 3:00:38.600]  me too so what do you think we do exactly that next next time there's a
[3:00:38.600 --> 3:00:44.360]  protest don't leave also you know since there's almost a pack on on law
[3:00:44.360 --> 3:00:49.240]  enforcement where they're at where each and every individual where they're at
[3:00:49.240 --> 3:00:53.240]  who knows but if they're really you know holding up to their old with the
[3:00:53.240 --> 3:00:58.720]  Constitution you know make some kind of coalition with them to not enforce
[3:00:58.720 --> 3:01:04.160]  policies not donors don't arrest you know like you're with us this we're
[3:01:04.160 --> 3:01:08.280]  Americans you're Americans to your car no I agree because the police I'm not
[3:01:08.280 --> 3:01:11.320]  against the police if they're being constitutional but they need to understand
[3:01:11.320 --> 3:01:15.320]  if they bow to the globalist and follow their orders they do become the enemy
[3:01:15.320 --> 3:01:18.920]  because the globalist the enemy so we're so close to losing the police over to
[3:01:18.920 --> 3:01:23.360]  the left and can you imagine once once you've got millions of Latissa James is
[3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:29.760]  on our butts when the sad thing about that of course is that the police if
[3:01:29.760 --> 3:01:34.880]  they do end up siding with tyrannical behavior and tyrannical leaders they're
[3:01:34.880 --> 3:01:38.440]  gonna lose all their stuff too their pensions are already gone right they're
[3:01:38.440 --> 3:01:42.400]  gonna lose that's why they're already saying we're gonna take the actual
[3:01:42.400 --> 3:01:45.200]  investment we made right and it's got problems but it's ours they're just
[3:01:45.200 --> 3:01:50.000]  gonna take it all right now that they they just want somebody to side with as
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:53.960]  well believe me one thing that nobody we need to be leaders in the police will
[3:01:53.960 --> 3:01:57.560]  side with us and they will I mean you know why because nobody can argue
[3:01:57.560 --> 3:02:01.000]  passion it's like calling it you can say he saved or not saved or whatever but
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:04.400]  one thing you cannot argue is his passion you can think Alex Jones is
[3:02:04.400 --> 3:02:07.880]  crazy you think Daryl's crazy you think Christians are crazy doesn't matter
[3:02:07.880 --> 3:02:11.640]  people respect passion at the very least they're gonna and why do real
[3:02:11.640 --> 3:02:14.480]  Christians have so much passion Renaissance man great job thank you
[3:02:14.480 --> 3:02:18.720]  god bless go ahead he's gone what we gonna say about passion well just the
[3:02:18.720 --> 3:02:22.600]  fact is without passion you can't have power power comes from passion if you
[3:02:22.600 --> 3:02:26.160]  if you're once again lukewarm kind of go back to that if you're just kind of
[3:02:26.160 --> 3:02:29.000]  lethargic and lazy and you don't get anything done you're never gonna move
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:33.440]  mountains right but with faith that you have enough faith as a mustard seed Jesus
[3:02:33.440 --> 3:02:37.160]  says you could move mountains we can take the new older down we can Jimi
[3:02:37.160 --> 3:02:40.440]  Hendrix says standing next to a mountain but off it down with the edge of my
[3:02:40.440 --> 3:02:44.000]  hand we have to yeah we have to realize we're on the winning team light beats
[3:02:44.000 --> 3:02:47.880]  darkness no amount of darkness can overcome even the tiniest absolutely
[3:02:47.880 --> 3:02:50.400]  hunter in North Carolina thanks for holding your trooper we love you go
[3:02:50.400 --> 3:02:54.600]  ahead hey great to be with you guys really really tough to follow the
[3:02:54.600 --> 3:02:58.280]  pastor because he's saying all the things that we really need to hear it's
[3:02:58.280 --> 3:03:02.440]  kind of like following Van Halen as your opening act to try to say something but
[3:03:02.440 --> 3:03:05.920]  I've got two things that I really want to get out there that I think are super
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:10.600]  duper important and the first thing is the cure for the Info Wars overload I've
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:14.840]  been a listener a daily listener for 19 years and there's something that has
[3:03:14.840 --> 3:03:21.000]  come out not only through integrity but as the pastor said to follow the side
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:25.160]  of Christ if you look at football and you look at basketball and you look at
[3:03:25.160 --> 3:03:29.760]  baseball do you think that these people in these sports are following God right
[3:03:29.760 --> 3:03:34.040]  now absolutely not I've got some information for the Info Wars listeners
[3:03:34.040 --> 3:03:38.080]  and I think it's super duper important there is one sport out there that is so
[3:03:38.080 --> 3:03:43.920]  absolutely committed to God and I want everybody to hear this it's golf
[3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:48.640]  golf can be the cure for Info Wars overload and then sometimes I hear you
[3:03:48.640 --> 3:03:51.600]  Alex I get a little worried you know you get stressed out but that's also what
[3:03:51.600 --> 3:03:55.720]  brings a lot of the listeners to you is that you have that passion and you have
[3:03:55.720 --> 3:04:00.360]  that drive that we are all looking for well golf can reduce your anxiety golf
[3:04:00.360 --> 3:04:05.320]  can reduce your depression golf can lower your stress and this is all in
[3:04:05.320 --> 3:04:08.960]  no I played golf some when I was a kid I want to get back into it I think I know
[3:04:08.960 --> 3:04:12.080]  I get I live by golf course and when the golfers are done at night I go walk
[3:04:12.080 --> 3:04:15.520]  around and that reduces my stress golf is so zen you're like out there it's
[3:04:15.520 --> 3:04:19.840]  pretty you focus it's you know it's it's it's it's a meditative thing and lately
[3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:24.320]  I have gotten bummed out but but I'm feeling good today I can I am sure
[3:04:24.320 --> 3:04:29.240]  shame we got like 100 push-ups are going off we teach golf through rock and roll
[3:04:29.240 --> 3:04:33.720]  and if anyone's on YouTube out there please Google golf lesson with Hunter
[3:04:33.720 --> 3:04:38.000]  Watkins we actually make golf really easy through music but I want to mention
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:41.520]  one other thing and it's it's something that's very disturbing and that I
[3:04:41.520 --> 3:04:44.400]  thought you would mention through your connection through doctor group many
[3:04:44.400 --> 3:04:49.560]  years ago and whatnot you talked about epigenetics yes epigenetics is the thing
[3:04:49.560 --> 3:04:53.840]  that will absolutely suffer if this vaccine goes through I'm looking at an
[3:04:53.840 --> 3:04:59.160]  article right now that DNA memories have been passed down for 14 generations if
[3:04:59.160 --> 3:05:05.240]  we take these vaccines your memory will be wormhole your family your great
[3:05:05.240 --> 3:05:09.760]  grandfather your grandfather all the things that are passed through DNA will
[3:05:09.760 --> 3:05:14.640]  absolutely be taken over and I am not gonna have it I'm there's no way in hell
[3:05:14.640 --> 3:05:19.080]  you're gonna wipe you can burn the books you can reprogram Google to hide the
[3:05:19.080 --> 3:05:21.680]  real history by the way the enemy knows that that's why they made that movie in
[3:05:21.680 --> 3:05:25.240]  2005 the island where they have clones for the rich people but some of the
[3:05:25.240 --> 3:05:28.720]  clones already know it's been passed on to definitely when they made the clone
[3:05:28.720 --> 3:05:31.240]  they already had the memories of the person the cells they were cloned from
[3:05:31.240 --> 3:05:34.600]  and so that's a whole other level of this and yes definitely Gates is trying to
[3:05:34.600 --> 3:05:38.880]  do something through these new DNA vaccines that literally reprogram the
[3:05:38.880 --> 3:05:41.760]  cell it's not a vaccine thank you Hunter you we're gonna do one more segment
[3:05:41.760 --> 3:05:45.200]  the other callers but you want to comment on that I just I've got about 15
[3:05:45.200 --> 3:05:47.880]  nine fifty nine seconds we're gonna come back we do one more segment okay that
[3:05:47.880 --> 3:05:51.960]  brackets great you understand so yes no I mean it's amazing when you think of the
[3:05:51.960 --> 3:05:56.080]  neurology and the genius that's why I can't imagine how anybody could ever
[3:05:56.080 --> 3:05:59.400]  really believe in evolution that's like saying this whole studio happened by
[3:05:59.400 --> 3:06:04.240]  chance right I mean if I try to convince you Alex hey this whole studio over a
[3:06:04.240 --> 3:06:07.200]  billion years all the elements everything came together and one cells way
[3:06:07.200 --> 3:06:11.000]  more complex than this right exactly but it came out now that the DNA is a junk
[3:06:11.000 --> 3:06:14.200]  which we already knew that as they coiled it doesn't break it just keeps
[3:06:14.200 --> 3:06:18.640]  creating new right no here to unravel DNA would go from here to the moon it's
[3:06:18.640 --> 3:06:21.800]  the only matter that's actually generating it now they discovered come from
[3:06:21.800 --> 3:06:25.120]  it's actually building it where did it come from it's like coming out of other
[3:06:25.120 --> 3:06:28.240]  dimension they they're freaking out they can't even tell you what came first the
[3:06:28.240 --> 3:06:31.440]  chicken or the egg but Bill Gates says you're gonna take something that makes
[3:06:31.440 --> 3:06:35.040]  everybody sick that we're gonna put in it right and we're gonna alter your RNA
[3:06:35.040 --> 3:06:39.680]  and everybody in the world has to take it no choice are you gonna do it if that
[3:06:39.680 --> 3:06:45.520]  ain't Margaret the Beast devil stuff I don't know what is I ain't doing it
[3:06:45.520 --> 3:06:53.200]  States cracking down on social gatherings says see it in because Fauci says if
[3:06:53.200 --> 3:06:58.960]  we don't we'll see further surges in coronavirus positives because they're
[3:06:58.960 --> 3:07:04.000]  only ramping up the testing because the test have been designed at the Wuhan
[3:07:04.000 --> 3:07:08.960]  lab it turns out to be completely fraudulent they cook the whole thing up

[3:10:21.520 --> 3:10:24.040]  and Derek I'll give each person about a minute or so I appreciate you holding
[3:10:24.040 --> 3:10:28.200]  but Darrell closing comments I just wanted to once again charge people to get
[3:10:28.200 --> 3:10:31.440]  up get out and get busy and I want you to take these words of wisdom from the
[3:10:31.440 --> 3:10:36.520]  Apostle Paul and it's just then simply is finally brethren be strong in the Lord
[3:10:36.520 --> 3:10:40.120]  in the power of his might put on the full armor of God that you may be able
[3:10:40.120 --> 3:10:44.760]  to withstand the wiles of the devil for we don't wrestle against flesh and blood
[3:10:44.760 --> 3:10:49.000]  but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness in
[3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:53.520]  this age and against the spiritual host of wickedness in heavenly places so
[3:10:53.520 --> 3:10:58.600]  therefore take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the
[3:10:58.600 --> 3:11:02.200]  evil day the day we're in right now it's what he's talking about when he says
[3:11:02.200 --> 3:11:06.360]  host he doesn't mean a host at your house it means armies right so this is war
[3:11:06.360 --> 3:11:10.600]  this is not just an info war now they're in your face war they're taking your
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:14.320]  stuff war they're forcing you to wear a mask war they're taking your job war
[3:11:14.320 --> 3:11:17.840]  okay have you had enough they're telling you you're not essential so I'm
[3:11:17.840 --> 3:11:22.120]  telling you right now put on the helmet of salvation the breastplate of
[3:11:22.120 --> 3:11:26.720]  righteousness have that belt of truth securely fastened around your waist take
[3:11:26.720 --> 3:11:30.440]  up that shield of faith put your faith in trust in God quit putting it in men
[3:11:30.440 --> 3:11:34.840]  quit putting it in yourself and wield wisely that sort of the spirit take it
[3:11:34.840 --> 3:11:38.560]  to the enemy there is no armor protecting your back because you're not
[3:11:38.560 --> 3:11:42.320]  supposed to turn and run like a coward God will protect you if you'll confront
[3:11:42.320 --> 3:11:46.960]  the evil if you're confronted with this you can stand in this evil day if
[3:11:46.960 --> 3:11:50.880]  you'll take it to the enemy quit cowering in fear that's key though you
[3:11:50.880 --> 3:11:53.480]  don't have any arm in your back because when you take action God's mind that's
[3:11:53.480 --> 3:11:57.200]  it you got the power of the holy angels behind you didn't you ever hear what
[3:11:57.200 --> 3:12:01.160]  Jesus said when they were saying hey you know we're gonna come we're gonna kill
[3:12:01.160 --> 3:12:04.800]  you we're gonna do that and Peter comes he chops off the ear of the of the
[3:12:04.800 --> 3:12:10.760]  garden and Jesus is like hey don't worry man I've got to do this for this time in
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:14.960]  this place to fulfill these prophecies don't you know I could call legions of
[3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:19.040]  angels to come and protect me if I wanted to and that is the time we're
[3:12:19.040 --> 3:12:23.280]  living and now God will come to our rescue God will save our country he will
[3:12:23.280 --> 3:12:27.560]  turn this tide no one knows the hour of the day he returns you know why because
[3:12:27.560 --> 3:12:32.840]  it really is up to us we can put it off we can delay the inevitable it is
[3:12:32.840 --> 3:12:37.200]  inevitable it will happen but like me and Alex talked years ago when we first
[3:12:37.200 --> 3:12:41.480]  met our job is to continue to wake people up to get people when you're right
[3:12:41.480 --> 3:12:44.520]  it's like a choose your own adventure it really is we're all doing it together
[3:12:44.520 --> 3:12:48.320]  if you do nothing God's like you know I'm just gonna turn you over to your
[3:12:48.320 --> 3:12:51.660]  reprobate mind you deserve the evil you're great delusion else you're gonna
[3:12:51.660 --> 3:12:55.160]  be Belsazar the writing's on the wall the enemies in the gate and you've been
[3:12:55.160 --> 3:12:58.080]  found want Darrell you're gonna start coming back once a month it's been too
[3:12:58.080 --> 3:13:01.680]  long five six years let's jam in these calls they've been so good about holding
[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:06.960]  let's talk to Derek in North Carolina than Brennan go ahead Derek and Alex
[3:13:06.960 --> 3:13:10.840]  it's such an honor to talk to you I know you don't like these honor talking to
[3:13:10.840 --> 3:13:15.080]  you brother what's on your mind have you guys noticed that Jim Jones and Charles
[3:13:15.080 --> 3:13:19.880]  Manson seem to be the founders of the Democratic Party recently yes they act
[3:13:19.880 --> 3:13:24.520]  just like psychotic crazy people okay so two really quick points about Trump
[3:13:24.520 --> 3:13:28.640]  what he can do first of all I think that he has the right to pardon anybody he
[3:13:28.640 --> 3:13:32.640]  should come out and say it would be a darn shame if Dr. Fauci wound up dead and
[3:13:32.640 --> 3:13:37.160]  then just pardon the person that kills him but that I know he can't do that but
[3:13:37.160 --> 3:13:40.640]  but I think that that would be a really good thing the second thing is I think
[3:13:40.640 --> 3:13:45.560]  he should be able to write a executive order stating that if you want to be
[3:13:45.560 --> 3:13:50.080]  deemed as a essential company you have to serve everybody you don't have the
[3:13:50.080 --> 3:13:58.200]  right to block anybody that doesn't wear a mask the points for you Alex mask does
[3:13:58.200 --> 3:14:01.920]  this mask smell like chloroform I think would be a really funny one for you to
[3:14:01.920 --> 3:14:09.520]  put out there and I have asthma I have a COPD shirt that people can wear in the
[3:14:09.520 --> 3:14:13.160]  stores so that we don't even have to talk to these people about oh you're
[3:14:13.160 --> 3:14:17.120]  saying wear a shirt that says I have asthma well here's the deal I don't have
[3:14:17.120 --> 3:14:20.600]  asthma but I do have sleep apnea and I've tried to wear one of these masks as a
[3:14:20.600 --> 3:14:23.520]  test and it makes me have an anxiety attack I never want to admit I have a
[3:14:23.520 --> 3:14:28.360]  weakness but I mean it's it's really I mean it's horrible it is it's horrible I
[3:14:28.360 --> 3:14:33.600]  hate it and and again it's a fraud and it's all based on lies
[3:14:33.600 --> 3:14:38.320]  yes I don't want any royalties or anything please make this shirt so I'll buy
[3:14:38.320 --> 3:14:42.000]  one of that heartbeat absolutely and look at this fellow wearing a mesh one too
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:46.520]  I mean it's all such a sick job today on the way down here there was a store I
[3:14:46.520 --> 3:14:49.840]  stopped to when I got gas you had to wear a mask I didn't have a mask so I just
[3:14:49.840 --> 3:14:53.160]  put my t-shirt over nobody said anything I just got my teeth I mean that's as
[3:14:53.160 --> 3:14:56.840]  effective as the best these it's all it's all a joke exactly that's why I'm
[3:14:56.840 --> 3:15:00.160]  sort of wearing like a little toy mask or my eyes hey you want a mask I got a
[3:15:00.160 --> 3:15:03.920]  mask for my t-shirt over your head and I'll just wear a burqa real quick here

[3:19:58.560 --> 3:20:03.640]  surveillance system global government medical tyranny forced inoculation the
[3:20:03.640 --> 3:20:09.120]  most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete that we are non
[3:20:09.120 --> 3:20:15.240]  essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take
[3:20:15.240 --> 3:20:21.040]  over the jobs that people once had by design this isn't like it's some
[3:20:21.040 --> 3:20:27.000]  advancement that we just fell into it's been preplanned organized globally and
[3:20:27.000 --> 3:20:32.040]  it's extremely predatory and through governmental actuaries and tax programs
[3:20:32.040 --> 3:20:37.240]  and regulations the central banks that control it all are able to pick the
[3:20:37.240 --> 3:20:42.600]  winners and the losers and consolidate power this is the truest form of
[3:20:42.600 --> 3:21:06.240]  technocracy fascism you're listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin
[3:21:06.240 --> 3:21:17.040]  Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones and now your host Matt Bracken
[3:21:17.200 --> 3:21:22.320]  hey you've got me for the rest of the hour and seeing those books on the
[3:21:22.320 --> 3:21:28.720]  screen reminds me I'm selling a lot of the signed actual printed books because
[3:21:28.720 --> 3:21:33.720]  I think it's starting to sink in that the audio and the digital books are
[3:21:33.720 --> 3:21:38.120]  probably just going to go away when the if and when the communists take over
[3:21:38.120 --> 3:21:43.720]  because that's a real likely outcome at this point now in this next segment I
[3:21:43.720 --> 3:21:50.040]  want to talk about money but not not like a financial advisor or anything like
[3:21:50.040 --> 3:21:55.200]  that I want to talk about what money really is and what it isn't if you've
[3:21:55.200 --> 3:21:59.720]  been following like Fox Business News they do the scroll at the bottom you
[3:21:59.720 --> 3:22:04.040]  might have noticed that the price of gold has been hovering just below two
[3:22:04.040 --> 3:22:08.960]  thousand dollars for a couple weeks and in the last two days it's shot right
[3:22:08.960 --> 3:22:13.920]  through and above two thousand dollars what does that mean does that mean that
[3:22:13.920 --> 3:22:19.760]  gold is now more valuable actually no it does not what it means is that the
[3:22:19.760 --> 3:22:27.560]  dollar and most other global paper fiat currencies are crashing in value
[3:22:27.560 --> 3:22:34.160]  gold is still exactly the same gold and silver so I've actually I've actually
[3:22:34.160 --> 3:22:39.400]  got a couple props here today this is silver this is what's called a silver
[3:22:39.400 --> 3:22:45.120]  round and it's actually a little cool little Texas Mullen lobby one it's not
[3:22:45.120 --> 3:22:49.040]  a government issue coin it's what they call a silver round but it'll say on
[3:22:49.040 --> 3:22:54.720]  there you know one Troy ounce point nine nine five so fine silver that's pure
[3:22:54.720 --> 3:23:02.280]  silver that's now worth in dollars twenty three dollars an ounce a Troy ounce
[3:23:02.280 --> 3:23:08.280]  of gold is worth two thousand historically the ratio between gold and
[3:23:08.280 --> 3:23:13.440]  silver has varied from a fifteen to one to currently it's almost a hundred to
[3:23:13.440 --> 3:23:19.960]  one which means that silver has a long way to go to climb up now what is how do
[3:23:19.960 --> 3:23:26.440]  you define money what is money now is this money no this is a Federal Reserve
[3:23:26.440 --> 3:23:31.120]  note it's not issued by the United States government on at all it's issued by the
[3:23:31.120 --> 3:23:38.040]  Federal Reserve read the creature from Jekyll Island 1913 that money at this
[3:23:38.040 --> 3:23:43.160]  point in history is no different than a Russian ruble during the Soviet Union
[3:23:43.160 --> 3:23:49.560]  it's a pure fiat currency it has as much value as people believe that it has
[3:23:49.560 --> 3:23:55.200]  for most of the 20th century you could convert your dollars to gold you could
[3:23:55.200 --> 3:24:03.400]  just get 35 dollars get an ounce of gold that stopped in 1971 and there's been
[3:24:03.400 --> 3:24:09.160]  sort of a hybrid program since then which was King dollar was the was the
[3:24:09.160 --> 3:24:13.480]  basis of what was called the Petro dollar so as if you wanted to go to Saudi
[3:24:13.480 --> 3:24:18.960]  Arabia and buy a shipload of petroleum you had to pay the Saudis in American
[3:24:18.960 --> 3:24:25.320]  dollars it was a sweet deal we're now destroying the dollar this this COVID-19
[3:24:25.320 --> 3:24:33.560]  bailout the the $600 a week to you know part-time waitresses this is just the
[3:24:33.560 --> 3:24:38.520]  printing press is going full Venezuela and there's going to be a price to pay
[3:24:38.520 --> 3:24:44.440]  now if you look at gold again there the other the other markers of what gold is
[3:24:44.440 --> 3:24:49.320]  it's got to be portable that's definitely portable that's a Mexican
[3:24:49.320 --> 3:24:55.840]  two-peso gold coin that's an out a gram and a half of gold that's now a hundred
[3:24:55.840 --> 3:25:04.060]  dollars that right there $100 okay this is a silver junk dime this is a pre-64
[3:25:04.060 --> 3:25:10.640]  dime mercury dime that's now worth about two and a half or three dollars but if
[3:25:10.640 --> 3:25:14.360]  you actually want it if you want it delivered you're gonna have to pay way
[3:25:14.360 --> 3:25:19.200]  over the spot price because nobody's giving up their physical gold and silver
[3:25:19.200 --> 3:25:24.920]  now you know that the price of gold has been suppressed with all kind of of of
[3:25:24.920 --> 3:25:31.800]  shenanigans in in gold equities so-called paper gold but that now people are
[3:25:31.800 --> 3:25:37.040]  wanting the physical that fear is in the air war is in the air with crisis and
[3:25:37.040 --> 3:25:41.280]  catastrophe or in the air and people want the physical but if you want the
[3:25:41.280 --> 3:25:45.680]  physical you're gonna have to pay more so it's bracken saying hey go out and try
[3:25:45.680 --> 3:25:50.520]  to see a web find a website where they'll deliver you silver or gold no I'm
[3:25:50.520 --> 3:25:56.080]  suggesting an alternative another form of money your money is inherently
[3:25:56.080 --> 3:26:02.200]  valuable it's durable it's divisible and it's portable so real estate has a lot
[3:26:02.200 --> 3:26:07.280]  of these qualities but it sure isn't portable if you know if the you know the
[3:26:07.280 --> 3:26:10.800]  enemy sweeps through your territory and you have to flee you can't take your land
[3:26:10.800 --> 3:26:16.880]  with you you can take gold now something it's not quite as compact as gold but is
[3:26:16.880 --> 3:26:23.640]  extremely valuable it is still available and it's and it's very durable it's
[3:26:23.640 --> 3:26:29.720]  valuable for many reasons but the main reason is this will actually stop people
[3:26:29.720 --> 3:26:35.960]  from hurting you right here okay there's one unit that's a dollar just like this
[3:26:35.960 --> 3:26:41.000]  these are both a dollar okay now depending on the quality of this it
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:45.680]  might be currently 35 cents or it might be a buck and a half depending on what
[3:26:45.680 --> 3:26:53.040]  it is but in this form this is what I would call a $500 bill okay there's a
[3:26:53.040 --> 3:26:59.840]  $500 bill right there weighs about 20 some pounds that's quality ammunition
[3:26:59.840 --> 3:27:05.920]  name brand known quantity accurate really good stuff that's in the bucket
[3:27:05.920 --> 3:27:10.760]  bullet club that's pretty hard to tote around in your back pocket but how about
[3:27:10.760 --> 3:27:18.240]  a $20 bill or a $25 bill that's what these would be these are that's 25 of
[3:27:18.240 --> 3:27:23.880]  quality hornety defensive pistol ammo there's a hundred of you know
[3:27:23.880 --> 3:27:30.280]  frangible 556 kind of like high-velocity varmint type round for when you don't
[3:27:30.280 --> 3:27:36.200]  want to leave perfect pristine slugs wherever but these are known quantities
[3:27:36.200 --> 3:27:44.880]  that's a this is a $20 bill and in in five years when a dollar is worth a penny
[3:27:44.880 --> 3:27:51.120]  in terms of buying power that's still going to be worth you know what a slice
[3:27:51.120 --> 3:27:56.440]  of a piece of gold or ace you know a slice of a piece of silver because it's
[3:27:56.440 --> 3:28:03.800]  got its own inherent value all right now right now the the US government is
[3:28:03.800 --> 3:28:08.840]  just flooding the market with dollars there there's very little economic
[3:28:08.840 --> 3:28:13.240]  activity so we're not seeing inflation taking off because people just aren't
[3:28:13.240 --> 3:28:17.200]  buying people are holding on to the money that they're getting from the
[3:28:17.200 --> 3:28:22.320]  government and out of fear spending as little as possible but we are baking
[3:28:22.320 --> 3:28:28.720]  hyperinflation into the cake and it is going to explode once you start giving
[3:28:28.720 --> 3:28:33.680]  people the $600 a week anybody that says I'm going to turn it off is
[3:28:33.680 --> 3:28:38.560]  automatically going to be painted as a Scrooge the Grinch you know the the
[3:28:38.560 --> 3:28:43.840]  greedy the greedy Republican once you turn that free money stick it on it's
[3:28:43.840 --> 3:28:49.040]  really hard to turn off and this is just the beginning stage of the United
[3:28:49.040 --> 3:28:54.720]  States going Venezuela or Zimbabwe so what is the government going to do at
[3:28:54.720 --> 3:29:00.200]  about this are they going to outlaw guns good luck are they going to outlaw the
[3:29:00.200 --> 3:29:05.520]  sale of bullets maybe that'll just make them more valuable are they going to
[3:29:05.520 --> 3:29:10.320]  prohibit people trading and buying in gold well how could they do that well
[3:29:10.320 --> 3:29:13.680]  if I want to buy something for my neighbor and I offer him gold for that
[3:29:13.680 --> 3:29:18.080]  tractor that's great as long as he's not you know being paid by the government
[3:29:18.080 --> 3:29:23.160]  to turn you in like a stasi deal where you go to the Gulag for doing an
[3:29:23.160 --> 3:29:28.840]  illegal gold transaction this might all sound nuts but I mean look I've got a
[3:29:28.840 --> 3:29:32.800]  decent track record for for guessing this stuff and it's not always turning
[3:29:32.800 --> 3:29:38.040]  out to be nuts so if you if you're holding dollars in the bank in a digital
[3:29:38.040 --> 3:29:42.880]  form you might say hey I'm collecting a half a percent interest it's I'm making
[3:29:42.880 --> 3:29:47.240]  money you know slow but sure no you're watching the value of your dollars
[3:29:47.240 --> 3:29:53.360]  evaporate and when the hyperinflation kicks in it's going to evaporate really
[3:29:53.360 --> 3:29:58.880]  fast what's not going to evaporate is this stuff that is going to hold its
[3:29:58.880 --> 3:30:06.440]  value you will be able to walk into a hardware store with this and that will
[3:30:06.440 --> 3:30:12.760]  always have the value of a current you know 2020 $20 bill always it's never
[3:30:12.760 --> 3:30:18.200]  going to lose its value so if you can't afford to buy gold and silver or you're
[3:30:18.200 --> 3:30:21.680]  afraid you're not going to get delivery you know you'll get your credit card
[3:30:21.680 --> 3:30:27.120]  information and wind up getting nothing but promises go to Academy sports go
[3:30:27.120 --> 3:30:34.120]  online if you think it's expensive now it's cheap now for quality ammo a buck
[3:30:34.120 --> 3:30:38.880]  a bullet is going to seem like the bargain of a lifetime so I said get into
[3:30:38.880 --> 3:30:43.980]  ammo right now and we'll be back after the break and talk about something new

[3:33:43.120 --> 3:33:47.880]  infowarstore.com a lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years and if
[3:33:47.880 --> 3:33:52.660]  you go back to those shows we laid out the AI takeover plan the tracking of
[3:33:52.660 --> 3:33:57.800]  cell phones how programmed master computers would manipulate control
[3:33:57.800 --> 3:34:02.880]  society how they'd be able to not just predict large groups of human movements
[3:34:02.880 --> 3:34:06.600]  and activities but even predict what individuals would do and then once you
[3:34:06.600 --> 3:34:10.080]  could predict what individuals were going to be doing you can add stimuli
[3:34:10.080 --> 3:34:15.200]  through the AI systems through the computers through digital billboards
[3:34:15.200 --> 3:34:19.400]  through face scanning through the social credit score to control people and make
[3:34:19.400 --> 3:34:23.640]  them act like you want it to but when we cover that the media would attack us and
[3:34:23.640 --> 3:34:27.400]  say we were making it up it was a conspiracy theory even though it was in
[3:34:27.400 --> 3:34:31.280]  the actual corporate level blueprint documents well the next level of the
[3:34:31.280 --> 3:34:35.640]  blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system
[3:34:35.640 --> 3:34:39.840]  to make humans obsolete and phase us out and it's something about a thousand
[3:34:39.840 --> 3:34:43.840]  times crazier than what Hitler planned so we might want to dismantle the system
[3:34:43.840 --> 3:34:46.080]  now
[3:34:46.080 --> 3:35:06.640]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:35:06.640 --> 3:35:19.240]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 it's Matt Bracken you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:35:20.240 --> 3:35:28.840]  no I wish I didn't have to talk about this because it's fairly depressing you
[3:35:28.840 --> 3:35:34.880]  know if I was a farmer in a field in in middle of Europe in 1914 in the summer
[3:35:34.880 --> 3:35:41.120]  and I saw all of these trains full of soldiers moving towards the front you
[3:35:41.120 --> 3:35:47.280]  know war hasn't been declared but it's it's a it's a bad feeling you just know
[3:35:47.280 --> 3:35:53.680]  something really really awful is heading our way and I would say that the the
[3:35:53.680 --> 3:36:01.000]  kinetic phase of this revolution is about to start I would point to something
[3:36:01.000 --> 3:36:08.680]  that happened in Austin last weekend where possibly the kinetic phase was
[3:36:08.680 --> 3:36:15.640]  averted by really very strong local and federal law enforcement operating off
[3:36:15.640 --> 3:36:20.360]  of intelligence maybe confidential informants I can't say I don't have I'm
[3:36:20.360 --> 3:36:27.160]  not privy to that level of information but a real pivotal movement of a pivotal
[3:36:27.160 --> 3:36:32.000]  turning point in this entire revolution this insurrection this communist
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:37.360]  insurrection you're from Portland to Minneapolis to Austin and other points
[3:36:37.360 --> 3:36:47.800]  has been the death of Garrett Foster in Austin he was the BLM Antifa guy with
[3:36:47.800 --> 3:36:54.920]  the AK-47 who was filmed saying that that conservatives are sissies and would
[3:36:54.920 --> 3:36:59.680]  never do anything five minutes later he actually didn't say sissies but five
[3:36:59.680 --> 3:37:07.720]  minutes later the dude was dead he had apparently raised an AK-47 toward an
[3:37:07.720 --> 3:37:13.200]  active duty army soldier stationed at Fort Hood who was that night working as
[3:37:13.200 --> 3:37:19.200]  an Uber driver and he learned that when you point an AK-47 at a soldier he might
[3:37:19.200 --> 3:37:25.680]  take it as a threat to his life well on the conservative side we see that as we
[3:37:25.680 --> 3:37:31.200]  see that as a legit good self-defense shooting but on the communist side the
[3:37:31.200 --> 3:37:36.480]  way that it's being spun is an example of the federal government's double
[3:37:36.480 --> 3:37:42.640]  standard that the three percenters and the the quote-unquote white militia
[3:37:42.640 --> 3:37:47.160]  types they can march in Richmond they can they can go to various state
[3:37:47.160 --> 3:37:53.360]  capitals toting their guns and nothing happens to them but poor Garrett Foster
[3:37:53.360 --> 3:38:00.080]  he just takes one little bitty AK-47 and a white racist kills him murders him
[3:38:00.080 --> 3:38:05.360]  that's how the communists look at the death of Garrett Foster they see him as
[3:38:05.360 --> 3:38:11.720]  a hero of the revolution never mind that you know in Richmond and the state
[3:38:11.720 --> 3:38:17.680]  capitals the three percenters they're not raising a gun at anybody they're just
[3:38:17.680 --> 3:38:23.520]  doing open carry they're they're not in a nighttime illegal roadblock you know
[3:38:23.520 --> 3:38:29.800]  stopping traffic pounding on cars breaking windows and then raising an AK-47 to
[3:38:29.800 --> 3:38:35.040]  them that that means nothing well last weekend in Austin there was there was
[3:38:35.040 --> 3:38:42.200]  word that that BLM quote-unquote Antifa I call them the revolutionary communists
[3:38:42.200 --> 3:38:46.720]  that's what they really are you know the BLM and Antifa are just cover names for
[3:38:46.720 --> 3:38:52.880]  the revolutionary communists anyway there there was intel that they were
[3:38:52.880 --> 3:38:57.120]  actually going to be snipers positioned on balconies and rooftops around
[3:38:57.120 --> 3:39:02.920]  downtown Austin and they had these it these kind of goofball I call them the
[3:39:02.920 --> 3:39:09.520]  bait team which were like John Brown gun club type communists with you know with
[3:39:09.520 --> 3:39:16.040]  rifles who were going to instigate some kind of a pushing match with what they
[3:39:16.040 --> 3:39:20.560]  hoped and expected would be right-wingers showing up to counter protest
[3:39:20.560 --> 3:39:26.680]  and if they instigated it properly then a conservative will wind up raising a
[3:39:26.680 --> 3:39:33.440]  rifle at which point a communist sniper would shoot him this was the plan as
[3:39:33.440 --> 3:39:39.080]  has been as law enforcement got on to it this is why they put out that letter to
[3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:45.200]  the hotels and buildings around Austin to be on the lookout for suspicious
[3:39:45.200 --> 3:39:52.480]  activity involving people scouting out shooting positions they had helicopters
[3:39:52.480 --> 3:39:57.480]  in the air with Ford looking infrared searching for snipers they did recover
[3:39:57.480 --> 3:40:03.520]  weapons sniper weapons not in the act of you know a guy in a sniper's hide but
[3:40:03.520 --> 3:40:08.480]  being transported I never read anything about any arrests so possibly they just
[3:40:08.480 --> 3:40:14.480]  confiscated or examined the weapons they without making an arrest because perhaps
[3:40:14.480 --> 3:40:20.360]  the John Brown gun club communists with the guns weren't in the act of
[3:40:20.360 --> 3:40:25.440]  committing a crime but they averted something that could have easily been
[3:40:25.440 --> 3:40:29.600]  turned into you know the shot heard around the world because make no mistake
[3:40:29.600 --> 3:40:35.680]  to the communists Garrett Foster is a hero they're trying to turn him into a
[3:40:35.680 --> 3:40:41.040]  martyr for the cause that's why they're called the John Brown gun club they
[3:40:41.040 --> 3:40:47.720]  consider John Brown the abolitionist you know fanatic to be their their role
[3:40:47.720 --> 3:40:53.520]  model so dying for the cause is how you become a saint in the religion of woke
[3:40:53.520 --> 3:41:00.360]  you know dying for communism makes you a revolutionary hero martyr and saint so
[3:41:00.360 --> 3:41:06.400]  in the future I would look for this tactic to be tried again in Austin it
[3:41:06.400 --> 3:41:12.760]  seems like the feds and Texas Rangers Bureau Texas investigation were able to
[3:41:12.760 --> 3:41:17.440]  stop this but it is probably going to be tried somewhere else they're going to
[3:41:17.440 --> 3:41:23.200]  try to instigate and an incident where where the so-called white racist you
[3:41:23.200 --> 3:41:29.560]  know radicals are tricked or instigated into raising weapons at which point
[3:41:29.560 --> 3:41:34.600]  snipers will take them out one of the clues that this was going on is photos
[3:41:34.600 --> 3:41:38.680]  that I've seen of these of these communist radicals they look they might
[3:41:38.680 --> 3:41:42.920]  look like morons fat and out of shape they're just the bait team keep that in
[3:41:42.920 --> 3:41:48.800]  mind some of them had orange tape stripes on their shoulders what this
[3:41:48.800 --> 3:41:53.640]  indicates to me is that these were identifiers so that their snipers up
[3:41:53.640 --> 3:41:59.360]  above would be able to separate the friendlies from the enemies I mean
[3:41:59.360 --> 3:42:03.640]  that's the only reason to for a group of people to show up on the street with
[3:42:03.640 --> 3:42:08.960]  rifles but with orange tape stripes on their shoulders that's it that's an
[3:42:08.960 --> 3:42:14.240]  aerial identifier so the next time when when it happens in a less prepared
[3:42:14.240 --> 3:42:19.800]  venue than Austin and maybe they don't have the exact intel be aware that if
[3:42:19.800 --> 3:42:24.320]  you go to any of these street confrontations that gets into the pulling
[3:42:24.320 --> 3:42:30.800]  guns stage which we've seen happen now in Provo Utah we saw it happen in Albu
[3:42:30.800 --> 3:42:35.360]  Kirk in New Mexico with a shooting that resulted in another you know communist
[3:42:35.360 --> 3:42:41.600]  fatality you know self-defense shooting the communists are going to fight fire
[3:42:41.600 --> 3:42:47.200]  with fire as from their perspective as they see it be very cautious if you go
[3:42:47.200 --> 3:42:52.440]  to any open carry rallies like what happened in Louisville with the NFAC
[3:42:52.440 --> 3:42:59.400]  they're be very cautious about being lured into an instigated trap where
[3:42:59.400 --> 3:43:04.440]  you're going to be from their point of view legitimately in a self-defense way
[3:43:04.440 --> 3:43:10.440]  taken out by a sniper now this weekend in Palatka Florida which is about 50
[3:43:10.440 --> 3:43:17.080]  miles south of Jacksonville there's a giant statue of a Confederate it's not
[3:43:17.080 --> 3:43:23.760]  a particular Confederate you know person soldier it's just a monument to all the
[3:43:23.760 --> 3:43:29.920]  Confederates and the BLM is threatening to tear it down it's a pretty
[3:43:29.920 --> 3:43:34.520]  conservative County so that the politicians are saying we're not going to do
[3:43:34.520 --> 3:43:38.720]  it by mob action BLM is threatening to tear it down but this is in a
[3:43:38.720 --> 3:43:43.280]  conservative County and there are supporters of the Confederate monument
[3:43:43.280 --> 3:43:48.400]  who are saying you won't tear it down so keep your eye on Palatka Florida or
[3:43:48.400 --> 3:43:54.880]  other places where something like this can happen because the word is that the
[3:43:54.880 --> 3:44:00.160]  revolutionary communists I mean don't be a sucker and call them Antifa or BLM
[3:44:00.160 --> 3:44:05.560]  that's just using their cover term the revolutionary communists are going to
[3:44:05.560 --> 3:44:12.440]  try to instigate a confrontation that leads to raised weapons which leads to
[3:44:12.440 --> 3:44:18.120]  snipers and you can imagine this is going to be heard by all sides so if you
[3:44:18.120 --> 3:44:22.800]  get up close and personal at chest thumping level the next stage in this
[3:44:22.800 --> 3:44:28.720]  content in this dance is going to be overwatched by snipers and who knows if
[3:44:28.720 --> 3:44:34.920]  they're going to be law enforcement communists conservatives or false flag
[3:44:34.920 --> 3:44:39.440]  you know doing an intentional shooting of their so-called allies in order to
[3:44:39.440 --> 3:44:44.120]  blame it on the other side we're in very dangerous territory be careful out
[3:44:44.120 --> 3:44:49.240]  there don't be stupid all right if you're going to get up chest thumping
[3:44:49.240 --> 3:44:54.400]  while carry an open carry realize that you might be walking right into a bait
[3:44:54.400 --> 3:44:59.520]  operation you know where where you're going to be you know the victim of a
[3:44:59.520 --> 3:45:05.200]  planned operation this can absolutely happen and and it could be at a high
[3:45:05.200 --> 3:45:09.960]  level like a Las Vegas shooter or it could be at a just a single a single
[3:45:09.960 --> 3:45:15.920]  bullet situation but I think this is the next phase that's going to roll out so
[3:45:15.920 --> 3:45:21.320]  I don't know when I'll be on again but by the next time maybe we'll be talking
[3:45:21.320 --> 3:45:26.280]  about it in the past tense but regardless before the election it's
[3:45:26.280 --> 3:45:46.240]  going to hit the fan I have no doubt see you next time
